# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Are you working at the moment?
Nevida: That's correct. The Bimarstan and areas near it are under my jurisdiction.
Nevida: Do not fret, though. Now that Akasha has been shut down, I will no longer interfere in the exchange of knowledge between the doctors and their patients.
Nevida: What I am focusing on at present is whether dialog between doctors and patients is going smoothly, and whether medical supplies are being effectively distributed or not.
Nevida: Please cooperate with us Mahamata and make sure to report anything unusual to us at once.
