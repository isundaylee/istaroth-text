Younan: #Oh, it's you! I didn't think I would lose to a {M#young man}{F#young woman} with scrawny arms and legs! But you're a real fighter, so it was an honorable loss, haha!
Traveler: Will you stick around in Inazuma?
Younan: What? Just because I lost doesn't mean I can't stay here! ...Well, to tell you the truth, I've been waiting these last two days for the next cargo ship that my brothers are on to come and take me home.
Younan: If I'd known I would be out in the third round, I wouldn't have asked for so many days off, and not made any money. Fortunately, I won two games before, and I still have a few pennies left after I got the money to last me the next few days.
