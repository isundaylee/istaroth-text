Traveler: It's tough being a disciple.
Hajime: *sigh* You said it... It'd be bad if my master hears me complaining. If he overhears, he'll lecture me for the entire day.
Hajime: Thank you for your concern. Seeing as you are a Traveler on the move, I'll give these ores to you. If something is wrong with your weapon, they might be of use to you.
