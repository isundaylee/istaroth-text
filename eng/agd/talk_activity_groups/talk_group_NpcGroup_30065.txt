Kayabuki Ikkei: "Outlander Brigade," the latest trailblazer in Inazuman light literature, has just made its debut. Wanna have a look?

## Talk

Traveler: "Outlander Brigade"?
Kayabuki Ikkei: That's right! Striking name, eh? Don't worry, the text itself reads just as well as it sounds like it might!
Kayabuki Ikkei: Trust me, this series is going to be a big hit for sure!
Kayabuki Ikkei: At the moment, "When the Wind of Death Blew Towards the Blond Samurai" is just the first volume in the series. As for the second and third volumes, I already have some ideas for their names...
Kayabuki Ikkei: The second shall be named "The Fatal Flowery Blade," and the third, "Blond Samurai, Go With the Wind."
Kayabuki Ikkei: Heh, I guess you could call me a prodigious talent in naming things.
Kayabuki Ikkei: That said, I haven't decided on what to write exactly... although that's not really important at the moment.

Traveler: How are sales?
Kayabuki Ikkei: ...
Kayabuki Ikkei: None at the moment.

## Talk

Traveler: Not a single one?
Kayabuki Ikkei: ...
Kayabuki Ikkei: Well... yes.
Kayabuki Ikkei: That said, I believe that this state is only temporary. I mean, even the most famous authors were unknown once.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Such dilemmas are just like the martial training written about in the books — a test of one's heart and character. As such, I must persevere...
Kayabuki Ikkei: One day, my works will be acknowledged by the world at large!

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Kayabuki Ikkei: See you around!
Kayabuki Ikkei: Wait a moment — you're not going to buy a copy after all that?

## Talk

Kayabuki Ikkei: Hey, how's it going?
Traveler: About the novel you want to write...
Kayabuki Ikkei: I grew up reading storybooks and novels, and back then, I dreamed of becoming like Iwakura or Kitain, an unparalleled warrior and slayer of demons.
Kayabuki Ikkei: I only realized that I lacked that talent after I'd grown up. That's why I decided to write stories about warriors instead. The art of making lines of words shine is a martial art in and of itself, wouldn't you say?
Kayabuki Ikkei: I mean, I could've still have chosen to become an attaché to some military officer, but I must say that I'd prefer penning the tale of a carefree outland warrior like yourself.
Kayabuki Ikkei: I'm very much looking forward to your performance — just as much as I'd love to write it down, haha!
Traveler: About the Hyakunin Ikki...
Kayabuki Ikkei: In the early days, this was a mysterious rite used by the Tengu-Kin as a means of making a ruckus.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Even after they were banned, people would still sometimes organize it in secret. The organizers' identities are still shrouded in mystery.
Kayabuki Ikkei: It's a rather rowdy brawl, all things considered. Anyone can participate, mortal or monster.
Kayabuki Ikkei: That's got to be a dream come true for those who long for battle, eh?

Kayabuki Ikkei: I've written your performance in the last Hyakunin Ikki down. The draft has been sent to the Yae Publishing House for review... Wonder how it's going...
Traveler: About what happened before...
Kayabuki Ikkei: Your performance in the last Hyakunin Ikki was fabulous!
Kayabuki Ikkei: Even Shousen, the master of Shinryuu, could have never imagined such a doughty martial artist like you...
