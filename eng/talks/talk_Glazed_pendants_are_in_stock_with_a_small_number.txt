Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Glazed pendants are in stock, with a small number of bracelets also now available. Supplies are limited, buyers make haste, else this opportunity you will waste!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Hello, do you still have any of the jade Carp pendants I saw last time?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Sorry, those are sold out right now."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "If I had known sooner, I would've bought it then... I wonder if the Carp Adeptus will be angry at me for this. I hope she'll protect Chaoxi and bring him back home as soon as possible..."
