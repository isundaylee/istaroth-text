# Of Drink A-Dreaming


## Talk 1

Luka: Hello there! So, you must be the renowned Traveler.
Traveler: That's me.
Paimon: Hey, don't forget about the equally renowned Paimon!
Luka: Hehe, of course. Well, it just so happens that our tavern, Angel's Share, is hosting a Bartender's Academy Week. I'm hoping the event might interest you.
Luka: Basically, you'll have full access to all of our ingredients to mix cocktails or any other drink you please.
Luka: As long as you refrain from being wasteful, you can enjoy unlimited refills for the drinks you create.
Paimon: Unlimited refills!
Luka: Also, you'll be rewarded handsomely if the guests are happy with your drinks.
Paimon: What? There's even rewards!?
Traveler: Well, Paimon is sold...
Paimon: Where do we sign up!?
Luka: It's called an "academy" but attendance is certainly not mandatory...
Luka: And you don't have to make your decision right away. You're more than welcome to give it a try first.
Luka: So, what do you think? Will you give the academy a try?
Traveler: Uh, can I help you?

## Talk 2

Charles: Hey, I know you two. So, what can I get for you today?
Traveler: Hi, Charles.
Paimon: Hey, Charles! Actually, we came to be bartenders today!
Charles: Bartenders? Oh, so Luka roped you two in, did he? He's got quite a knack for that.
Charles: #{NICKNAME}, you're certainly talented at handling difficult tasks, there's no doubt about that. But mixing cocktails is a whole different game, it's delicate work and requires a certain amount of finesse.
Charles: Everything from the ratios of your ingredients to your mixing techniques could affect the final product.
Paimon: #Don't worry. {F#She's}{M#He's} a fantastic cook. Cooking and cocktail-making have a lot in common, you know!
Charles: Alright, I'll take your word for it. Oh, and one more thing...
Charles: In a previous event, we had a student who arbitrarily mixed three kinds of hard liquor. Just one glass was enough to leave a customer passed out on the floor.
Charles: So in light of that incident, we decided to no longer provide alcoholic ingredients to beginners. I hope you'll understand.
Traveler: No problem at all.
Charles: Great, that just about covers all I have to say. You'll learn all the skills and techniques you need on the fly.

## Talk 3

Charles: Mmm, you're a quick learner, this tastes pretty good.
Paimon: Paimon agrees! This is amazing!
Charles: That was just practice, though. On the job, customers often will have special requests for their drinks.
Charles: Some may enjoy a stiffer drink, while others might prefer something more sour, everyone has their own preferences. Adjusting the amounts of the ingredients is always the key.
Paimon: Paimon would like a Caramel Pinecone, extra sweet, in the biggest glass you have. Please and thank you!
Charles: Well, that's about all there is to it. But, to become a truly exceptional bartender, in addition to mixing skills, you'll also need to master conversing with your customers...
Traveler: I'm up to the challenge!
Charles: Alright, in that case, you two can take this counter. If you have questions or need any help, just give me a holler.
Paimon: Whew... Class dismissed! Wait, where's Paimon's Caramel Pinecone?
Traveler: So you really did want a Caramel Pinecone...
Traveler: I love chatting with people.
