An item that can be used to replenish Original Resin. Once used, it will replenish 60 Original Resin.

·Multiple Transient Resins obtained on different weeks will have their expiration dates counted independently.

Pure energy that will dissipate with time. In this, it is similar to all else that is lovely in this world. But seize this opportunity and go make the world a slightly better place, as is fitting for one who dwells within the bounds of "time."
