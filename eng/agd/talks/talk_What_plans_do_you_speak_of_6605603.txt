Traveler: What plans do you speak of?
Manua: Ah, it's Miss Amina's entertainment facilities renovation plan.
Manua: Do you find it strange that the chief would bring her plans to me?
Manua: Heh, it's because I'm her assistant.
Manua: Amina is very bright and constantly comes up with innovative ideas, like building a water coaster or hosting a kayaking tournament.
Manua: If you ask me, I think she just wants to ride in a water coaster herself, haha. But her ideas have all been very popular with tourists, so we should support her as best as we can.
