Xiao: ...
Traveler: (You observe Xiao)
Xiao (The World is Silent; No One Speaks): (Xiao says nothing more. Complex emotions run across his face as he looks at the temple to Pervases.)

Xiao (The World is Silent; No One Speaks): (His expression is akin to that of a person who has been out in the blizzard for too long and seen far too much of it before finally gaining a place of respite from the battering snow.)
