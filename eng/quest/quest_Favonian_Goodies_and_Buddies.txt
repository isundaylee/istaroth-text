# Favonian Goodies and Buddies

Bernhard: Honorary Knight, Paimon! Good news! We have some new helpers!
Bernhard: These two store owners heard about our charity sale. They want to donate their earnings and join us.
Paimon: What? A donation? Are you sure?
Mats: Absolutely!
Mats: Each extra donation means one extra person getting the help they need. Both Pauline and I think that's more important than us making more money than we technically need.
Pauline: This year's Weinlesefest is busier than previous years, so we met our target earnings more quickly than we expected. That's enough for us.
Pauline: It doesn't seem right to leave the important task of caring for our most vulnerable to you alone. We just want to help however we can. Please, it's the least we can do.
Traveler: We are extremely grateful.
Paimon: Yeah! Ahh, this is the warmest, fuzziest feeling ever...
Paimon: Hmm, but this does mean that we'll have to change the name of our shop! Uhh, how about... Favonian Goodies and Buddies.
Traveler: Adding words... one way to make a big name for ourselves.
Paimon: Alright, let's give this all we've got and make this a charity event to remember!
Black Screen Text: With two new staff, the scale of the charity sale grows...
Paimon: Over here for snacks, fresh flowers, and general goods! Folks, grab bargains at Favonian Goodies and Buddies!
Paimon: Huh? Hey, look, it's Albedo!
Albedo: Hello there.
Traveler: Welcome to our store!
Paimon: Looking to buy anything in particular, Albedo?
Albedo: I'm not in dire need of anything right now. I just heard that you were running the Knights of Favonius' stall, and thought I'd come over.
Albedo: As it happens, Timaeus and I made some progress in our research recently, so I took the opportunity to bring you a batch of our finished product. Consider it our contribution to the charity effort.
Paimon: Aw, so you came all the way here just to help us out? That's so nice of you!
Paimon: Let's take a look here, we got bottles of... wait, what is this stuff?
Albedo: It's an Extra-Strong Sobriety Potion that can sober up the intoxicated and alleviate hangovers.
Albedo: Please hand them out for free to anyone who needs them. Having some complimentary items will undoubtedly help you attract more customers.
Paimon: Sounds like a super-useful invention! It must have taken you ages...
Albedo: Oh? It must have been a while since I demonstrated my capabilities to you.
Albedo: I most likely wouldn't have had any interest in research like this in the past.
Albedo: But now I think that it's worthwhile using alchemy to make people's lives easier in small ways like this.
Paimon: Definitely! Well, Paimon assumes so, 'cause Paimon's never been drunk before... but plenty of our customers probably have been.
Paimon: It would definitely ruin the mood if someone fell into the lake or tripped over a rock after having one too many glasses of festive cheer.
Traveler: We can't take all this and give nothing in return.
Paimon: Yeah, Albedo, you should take some snacks back with you and share them with Klee. It's on the house!
Albedo: Alright then, I shan't refuse.
Albedo: I had no idea you two had such keen business sense.
Albedo: It's a savvy choice of location for selling snacks. There's a festive mood all around, and the division of labor is eminently sensible.
Albedo: If any other knight of Favonius were running the show, it would be a much more... generic operation.
Paimon: Wow, getting complimented by Albedo is an amazing feeling... This must be how it feels to drink an Extra-Strong Sobriety Potion when you wake up with a groggy head!
Paimon: Anyway... it sounds like you know quite a lot about running a charity sale yourself, Albedo!
Albedo: Well, I provided a dozen or so landscape paintings for a previous charity event, also run by the Knights of Favonius.
Paimon: They must have been worth a fortune!
Albedo: Well, the people buying them certainly thought so.
Albedo: Some felt that my painting style was a rare one worth investing in, and offered a large sum of money for each work.
Albedo: This, plus the sizable profits made from auctioning some of my still life paintings, seemed to give Alice an idea.
Albedo: She used her personal connections to apply for some sort of certification for my artwork... I believe they call it "copyright"?
Albedo: Later, many artists began to imitate my landscape paintings, and they became a common sight throughout Mondstadt.
Traveler: That sounds familiar...
Albedo: According to the rules of the copyright that Alice applied for, the artists need to pay me a portion of their revenue for each landscape painting of this style that they sell.
Albedo: Wealth was never one of my goals. I don't care where the money goes, so I entrusted it to the Knights of Favonius and let them manage it.
Albedo: I suppose it would be fitting to use it to pay for the destruction that Alice has created.
Albedo: But from what I hear, they use it all on charitable initiatives, which is also a noble cause.
Traveler: So you've never participated in a charity sale...
Paimon: You never cease to amaze, Albedo...
Albedo: Though it was hardly my original intention, I have come to embrace my unexpected philanthropic achievements.
Traveler: Good for you.
Albedo: #Thank you, {NICKNAME}.
Albedo: Well then, I will be returning to the workshop. I wish you and the shop all the best.
Paimon: Thanks for your contribution, and good luck with your research!
Black Screen Text: You make some snacks for Albedo to take back with him...
Paimon: Come again when you're free!
Traveler: I want to learn to paint.
Albedo: And I am only too happy to share my expertise with you, however... practice is the most essential factor.
Traveler: Yet you've done more for charity than any of us...
Traveler: So it all came from you...
Traveler: It's been a while.
Traveler: Sounds good to me.
