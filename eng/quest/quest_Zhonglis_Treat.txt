# Zhongli's Treat


## Talk 1

Observe the Noctilucous Jade: (Only Noctilucous Jade of radiant grade at the very least is acceptable for use in the Rite of Parting.)
Observe the Noctilucous Jade: (Who'd have thought the hilichurls' cooking pot in Dadaupa Gorge would be a reliable means of assessing the quality...)

## Talk 2

Observe the kites: (The seven kites used in the ceremony, which represent The Seven.)
Observe the kites: #(How long before I find the one who took my {F#brother}{M#sister}?)

## Talk 3

Zhongli: Ah, you're here. There's no need to order, I've already done so.
Zhongli: "Third-Round Knockout" is not for lightweights, like those taverns in Mondstadt. Here, the owner does not take such unorthodox orders as fruit juice.
Traveler: So, does this mean I can order wine this time?
Zhongli: I ordered some wine-fermented sweet rice balls for you, if that counts.
Traveler: I guess I should have expected this...
Iron Tongue Tian: ...If it is to your liking, dear customers, I shall continue the tale of Lady Ningguang's Jade Chamber.
Paimon: Hey, there's even a storyteller here! Great atmosphere!
Zhongli: Besides fine wine, the excellent ambience is the reason why this place is so well-loved.
Zhongli: But when I say ambience, I refer to a different sort from the one the Teyvat Travel Guide uses to judge other establishments.
Iron Tongue Tian: As you all know, high above the land of Liyue lies a pavilion in the clouds, a palace in the mist...
Iron Tongue Tian: What does it mean to have all-seeing eyes? This, my friends: Lady Ningguang's masterwork that bridges earth and sky.
Iron Tongue Tian: Imagine. The weather is clear, and you gaze down from the deck on the world below...
Iron Tongue Tian: Behold! The glorious sights of Liyue Harbor, stretching out far and wide!
Iron Tongue Tian: These are but scraps of paper, and yet they guide Lady Ningguang's hand — such is their value.
Iron Tongue Tian: Merely grasping one or two of them will surely gift you a fragment of her wisdom — enough to stay a step or two ahead of your peers.
Paimon: Tianquan Ningguang... feels like we're hearing this name a lot.
Paimon: Liyue locals talk about her, the Fatui hate her, she's most likely the one who hid the Exuvia, and we saw her at the Rite of Descension...
Paimon: Huh, Paimon wonders what sort of person she is.
Ganyu: At last, I have found you, you who returned from Jueyun Karst.
Paimon: Who's there!?
Traveler: Paimon, we gotta go... !
Ganyu: Wait! I am not with the Millelith, nor am I here to claim your bounty.
Ganyu: However, I am an emissary of the Liyue Qixing. My name is Ganyu, secretary at the Yuehai Pavilion, and I have come specifically to meet you.
Traveler: Emissary?
Ganyu: Well, in concrete terms, I am the corporate secretary for the Qixing. At the moment, I am serving as Lady Ningguang's special emissary.
Paimon: Ningguang sent you? We were literally just talking about her...
Ganyu: My apologies, you who have returned from Jueyun Karst... I am duty-bound, and cannot extend my courtesy to you in full.
Ganyu: But I have with me a letter from Lady Ningguang. She extends a formal invitation to you in her capacity as Tianquan.
Ganyu: She invites you to her palace in the sky.
Paimon: An official invitation...?
Ganyu: Lady Ningguang said this:
Ganyu: #"Invite {F#her}{M#him} to come here."
Ganyu: #"I wish to meet {F#her}{M#him}."
Ganyu: "At the Jade Chamber, together, we shall snip every one of these entwining dark threads."
Traveler: Secretary?

## Talk 4

Observe the bell: (A vital implement used in the Rite of Parting. The cleansing sound of the bell rids the deity of all impurities from the mortal world as it bids them farewell... Or something like that?)
Observe the bell: (It's hard to believe someone would store such a precious object in a teapot filled with cobwebs.)

## Talk 5

Observe the censer: (Everlasting Incense... The lengths we went to to get our hands on that.)
Observe the censer: (I guess they'll burn it during the Rite of Parting...?)
Observe the censer: (It should be a spectacular sight... two million, nine-hundred-and-ninety thousand Mora's worth of incense, going up in smoke.)

## Talk 6

Observe the perfume: (A specially prepared perfume, made from a rare type of Silk Flower. It has a faint scent.)
Observe the perfume: (Still, why would Rex Lapis go for the scent preferred by older women...)

## Talk 7

Zhongli: Ningguang... Ganyu...
Zhongli: I wonder where we will find them amid these dark tides?

## Talk 8

Paimon: And with that, the emissary who called herself Ganyu just disappeared...
Paimon: But we've received an invitation from the Liyue Qixing. Paimon still can't believe it!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}! We'll be meeting people that have way more money than Paimon could ever count... We should be on our best manners!
Traveler: I always mind my manners.
Zhongli: Hah... An invitation to visit the Jade Chamber is a rare honor, indeed.
Zhongli: You'd best be on your way now. But don't forget about the Rite of Parting. Once you've finished at the Jade Chamber, meet me at Dihua Marsh.
Paimon: Don't worry, we won't forget! Dihua Marsh. We'll see you there!
Traveler: Paimon is up to something again...
