Paimon: Phew, it sure took a while before we saw anything resembling civilization. Let's get closer and have a look.

Paimon: Wow! Paimon never thought that there'd be such a huge place underneath Watatsumi Island!
Paimon: Looks like our goal is that place in the middle.
Paimon: #Alrighty then, {NICKNAME}. Let's head in. Steadily now...
Paimon: Those ruins seem to be closer to us. Let's start there!
Paimon: Buildings means people... once upon a time, anyway. And where there's people, there'll be writing!
Paimon: And where there's writing and paper, there'll be those... hints that we can't even read.
