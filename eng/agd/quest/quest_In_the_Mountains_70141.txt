# In the Mountains


## Talk 1

Traveler: So, tell me about the ice.
Iris: Perhaps you've already noticed, but that slab of ice is surrounded by a great many blue plants.
Iris: I believe that those plants may be related in some way to the shard frozen in the ice.
Iris: If you wish to continue looking for those shards on Dragonspine, I'd say that you might have some luck following the trail of those blue plants.
Iris: I believe that the *Entombed City Outskirts* and *Starglow Cavern* are home to many of those blue plants. You can go and check them out. Perhaps you might discover something.

## Talk 2

Traveler: So, tell me about the ice.
Iris: Since we've got a way to melt that ice now, that means I can continue organizing expedition parties to explore the mountain...

## Talk 3

Traveler: So, tell me about the ice.
Iris: If you'd just like to have a look at the ice, you can just go to the place that I mentioned. For you own safety, don't go any further into the mountain.

## Talk 4

Iris: This is a sticky situation, indeed...
Traveler: How are things here on Dragonspine?
Iris: On this mountain? Well, I can only say that it's more dangerous than any other place in Mondstadt.
Iris: Apart from the harsh conditions, this mountain is also home to some strange... ice.
Iris: This ice is incredibly hard to break, and will not melt when exposed to fire. It has proved a major obstacle to our exploration as a result.
Iris: Unfortunately, we have been unable to find a way to deal with that ice, so we've had to go around it...
Traveler: I'll have a look at it.
Iris: You're just going to have a look, right? If so, I remember that there was a large slab of ice of that kind on the mountain's outer boundaries. Who knows what's frozen inside it...
Iris: You could have a look around there, but remember, it's best not to come this way again.

## Talk 5

Traveler: I found a shard under the platform.
Iris: Hydro Hypostasis fragment introduction...

## Talk 6

Traveler: How are things here on Dragonspine?
Iris: On this mountain? Well, I can only say that it's more dangerous than any other place in Mondstadt.
Iris: Apart from the harsh conditions, this mountain is also home to some strange... ice.
Iris: It is incredibly hard to break, and will not melt when exposed to fire.
Iris: Worst of all, a few roads have been blocked by this ice.
Iris: Quite a few of our expedition teams have been forced to turn back after being blocked by ice barricades that they could not get around.
Iris: *sigh* I wonder when we're going to find a way to get rid of that ice...
Traveler: I'll have a look at it.
Iris: You're just going to have a look, right? If so, I remember that there was a large slab of ice of that kind on the mountain's outer boundaries. Who knows what's frozen inside it...
Iris: You could have a look around there, but remember, it's best not to come this way again.

## Talk 7

Traveler: Tell me about those blue plants...
Iris: If you've a mind to, you can head to the area around the *Snow-Covered Path*, the *Entombed City Outskirts* and the *Starglow Cavern* to have a look. I remember seeing many of those blue plants there.

## Talk 8

Traveler: Do you know anything about the air current in the cavern?
Iris: You've already been that high up? That's very impressive. Still... a cavern blocked by a strange air current, you say? Let me think...
Iris: We did have an adventure team that also got lucky enough to reach a point very high up the mountain.
Iris: They couldn't get close enough, but they did report that a cavern nearby had a strange and powerful air current flowing out from it.
Iris: But logically speaking, no air current in such a place should be that strong. No one knows the reason why, either...
Iris: Apart from that strange air current, this mountain is also home to some very strange ice.
Iris: This ice is incredibly hard to break, and will not melt when exposed to fire. It has proved a major obstacle to our exploration as a result.
Iris: We have been unable to find a way to deal with that ice, so we've had to go around it...
Iris: What's more, blue plants are often found growing near this ice.
Iris: I could vaguely see that there was something encased within the ice. But since I was unable to melt it, catching a glimpse of it was as far as I got...
Iris: If you're interested, you can follow the trail of blue plants to have a look at that ice.
Iris: Let me think... I believe that the *Snow-Covered Path*, the *Entombed City Outskirts* and the *Starglow Cavern* are home to many of those blue plants. You can go and check them out.
Iris: A strange, powerful air current, bizarre ice, and odd plants...
Iris: Hahaha, if this was your standard tale of adventure, there would be some link between these three.
Iris: But in real life, it's best to be practical when adventuring... Make sure you prepare yourself sufficiently before heading up Dragonspine, you hear?

Iris: *sigh* I wonder when we're going to find a way to get rid of that ice...
Traveler: So, about the strange ice...
Iris: What? You encountered the strange ice... and you were able to melt it?
Iris: H—How can this be? How did you do it? Huh... There were strange crystals nearby?
Iris: You can use those to melt through the ice? I see, I see... Looks like I'll have to investigate this thoroughly...
Iris: Well, let's put that aside first. Looking at you, I suppose you want to continue going deeper into the mountain, yes?
Traveler: Do you know anything about the air current in the cavern?
Iris: You've already been that high up? That's very impressive. Still... a cavern blocked by a strange air current, you say? Let me think...

## Talk 12

Iris: Since we've got a way to melt that ice now, that means I can continue organizing expedition parties to explore the mountain...

## Talk 13

Traveler: About the summit...
Iris: There's a strange, huge pillar floating in mid-air at the summit? To think that there would be such a thing atop Dragonspine...
Iris: And there's a huge space below the ice under the pillar? That's... even weirder.
Iris: This is... inconceivable. Thank you. I will send explorers up there as quickly as we can to see what's happening there.
Iris: Ah, yes, I should thank you for helping us open the way to the summit. Please take these as thanks.
Iris: It seems Dragonspine really does have its secrets after all.
Iris: I do hope our next expedition will yield some new discoveries.

## Talk 14

Traveler: This mountain really is a dangerous place...
Iris: Oh? You're back. How did it go? Did you see the ice— Huh. You're in... quite a state, aren't you?
Traveler: Do you know anything about the air current in the cavern?
Iris: You've already been that high up? That's very impressive. Still... a cavern blocked by a strange air current, you say? Let me think...
Iris: Ah, that reminds me. We did have an adventure team that also got lucky enough to reach a point very high up the mountain.
Iris: They couldn't get close enough, but they did report that a cavern near the summit had a strange and powerful air current flowing out from it.
Iris: But logically speaking, no air current in such a place should be that strong. No one knows the reason why, either...
Iris: Apart from that strange air current, this mountain is also home to some very strange ice.
