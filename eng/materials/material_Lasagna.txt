A baked pasta dish. Spread cheese, meat sauce, and Béchamel sauce on a layer of pasta strips, and place another layer of pasta strips on the top — repeat the process a few times and bake the pasta until the cheese becomes golden and bubbly. The secret of its tastiness lies in the carefully-prepared meat sauce.
