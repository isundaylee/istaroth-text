# "Delightful Encounter"

A flowery accessory given away by Lyney at his magic shows. It is an arrangement of Lumidouce Bells, which symbolize parting, and Rainbow Roses that represent passion. Parting and passion are two separate perspectives sharing the same nature. What really matters is the present that we are living in.
