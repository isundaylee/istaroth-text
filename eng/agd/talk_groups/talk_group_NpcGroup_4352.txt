Traveler: What are you planning?
Aberdeen: As an adventurer, the greatest plan is of course to travel every inch of the world and explore every secret this world has to offer!

Traveler: Bye.
Aberdeen: Bye! Maybe our next meeting will be in somewhere else!

Aberdeen: Hehe, it sounds so exciting!

Aberdeen: Listen, to be the greatest adventurer, you must be ambitious and ready to take risks.
