# Missing title (1738925863)

Traveler: Keep up the good work.
Nanako: Yup! With your encouragement, I'll definitely become strong!
Nanako: That reminds me. Recently, when I was training in the dojo, I discovered a foreign-looking weapon. Did my master study it to hone his martial arts...?
Nanako: Even if we kept it here, not many people will know how to use it. If that's the case, how about I give it to you? You came from another lands, so I think you'll be able to draw out this sword's true potential.
