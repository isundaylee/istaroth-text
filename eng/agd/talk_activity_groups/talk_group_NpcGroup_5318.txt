Granna: Ah, Sedile's back in the village on vacation! I'll have to ask her how to pass the exam and join the Marechaussee Phantom!

## Talk

Traveler: Huh, so there's an exam for that too...
Granna: Of course there is! Or do you think they let just anyone in?
Granna: It's precisely because they're so strict that passing is considered impressive. Hmph, I've gotta grab this chance to ask Sedile everything!
Granna: And once I've made it, I'm so gonna show off to Virda!

Traveler: May you be successful.
Granna: Heh, thanks, but no need! I'll be fine, with or without anyone's well-wishes!
