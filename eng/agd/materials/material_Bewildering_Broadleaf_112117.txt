# Bewildering Broadleaf

An arrow-shaped leaf dropped by the monster known as the Tenebrous Mimiflora after being vanquished.
After corroding the Ley Lines and extracting the memories within, the creature grows these leaves as a means of storing the information it has deciphered. There may be a close link between these intricately patterned leaves and the forms that their host can mimic.
