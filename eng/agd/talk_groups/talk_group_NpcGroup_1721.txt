Paimon: Whoa, is the person in that painting... moving!?
Paimon: #Umm, hi! Paimon's Paimon, and this is Traveler. You couldn't tell us what this place is, could you?
Traveler: Howdy there!
Paimon: Nope, nothing. She doesn't seem to be able to hear us at all...
Traveler: Maybe our greeting wasn't formal enough?
Paimon: "O fair and noble lady, hearest thou our question?"
Paimon: Oh, yeah, all we needed to get a response was an elegant greeting... Pff, as if! Surely it's just a painting that can move?
Paimon: Anyway, mysterious as it is, we're not gonna find the answer by just waiting around. Why don't we go search for clues someplace else?
Traveler: Why don't you take a look inside the painting, Paimon?
Paimon: Ahh, so all Paimon needs to do is go inside the painting and we'll magically get to the bottom of this... Yeah right! Just how is Paimon supposed to do that!?
Paimon: #And why are we even talking about this like it's a possibility? What world are you living in, Traveler?
Paimon: Never mind... As mysterious as a moving painting is, we're not gonna find the answer by just waiting around. Why don't we go search for clues someplace else?
Traveler: I'm the Honorary Knight of the Knights of Favonius!
