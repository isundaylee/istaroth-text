Traveler: What are you doing?
Ziryab: I'm pulling my hair out on how to win her heart.
Ziryab: "Fresh breeze in the night" has too much emphasis on time, when I think about her day and night.
Ziryab: On the other hand, "Fresh night breeze" sounds rather cliche, like a line in a child's fairytale.
Ziryab: But just "Night breeze" would save more room for more serenade.
Ziryab: But the people in the square discussing the candidates for the next Grand Conservator are messing up my thoughts. If only I could have a quieter place to think.
