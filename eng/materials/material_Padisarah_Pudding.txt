# Padisarah Pudding

A popular dessert in Sumeru. Juices are squeezed from the petals of Padisarahs and Sumeru Roses before being mixed with milk, gelatin, sugar, and other ingredients, and then left to solidify. Cute appearance and sweet flavor make it a common sight at celebratory events in Sumeru.
