# Aesthetic Critique: Practice of Aesthetics


## Talk 1

Depierris: This is a good idea... but can it really be done this way...?
Traveler: How's the drawing going?
Depierris: Ah it's you! Thanks for your help previously with the photos! The sights they featured were truly inspiring.
Depierris: I already have an approximate idea, and I've drawn up some drafts, but... Well, they're not up to snuff.
Depierris: Don't misunderstand — this is not to say that I've painted some trash with no aesthetic value at all, but...
Depierris: I feel that they're missing something special, something that can help them transcend the ordinary.
Depierris: There's something too concrete about the things I have in mind... If I directly translated them into my painting, the beauty I wish to transmit will be damaged for sure.
Depierris: *sigh* I fear this is a problem that every artist must face...
Traveler: Perhaps you could try drawing something else?
Depierris: Thanks for the suggestion, but I fear that this problem will not be solved by a mere change of topics.
Depierris: Whether it be mountains and rivers, birds and beasts, or the world of humanity... None of them can escape this issue.
Depierris: It is precisely in their search for a solution that some of my colleagues have broken down and transmuted the sights they've seen using their inner feelings.
Depierris: Such art emphasizes one's inner emotions most of all, and the result on the canvas is... How can I explain it...
Depierris: Well, whether it be characters, scenery... Even light carries a sense of strangeness that no traditional sense of aesthetics can capture.
Depierris: A simplistic glance would lead most to believe these paintings to be the brainchildren of the illiterate in art, or the mad.
Depierris: But if you calm your spirit and get in tune with the artwork before you, you will hear it roar on the artist's behalf.
Depierris: That roar comes from the artist's heart and soul, speaking their feelings aloud... and those feelings are, more often than not, rather intense.
Depierris: Yet their voices cannot be perceived by the ear, but with the heart instead.
Depierris: As for me... I do not yet wish to give in on the concrete, and so I've come up with another way.
Depierris: I have decided to focus on color, and so I need to find stronger shades and simple yet powerful strokes.
Depierris: At the same time, I need to weaken the lighting and traditional scene compositions... These things will affect my expression, and so I must ask them to temporarily leave the scene...
Depierris: But the issue is that the strong, intense colors dictate the use of a lot of paint, and that I need to squeeze the paint directly onto the canvas to achieve the necessary effect.
Depierris: So, I've... uh, run out of paint. However, I cannot simply move my easel away at the moment. That would surely affect my creative work...
Depierris: Traveler, could I trouble you to visit Boucicaut? I've ordered a batch of good paints from him, and they should be ready at this point.
Depierris: Or perhaps... Could you help me get some Whopperflower Nectar? That way, I could make a batch of paints on my own.
Traveler: You can use nectar to make paint?
Depierris: Hahaha, of course you can. Some of my fellow artists even use Bird Eggs for that task!
Depierris: I hear that paints of this kind have delicate colors but rich layers, perfect for use in depicting resplendent sceneries.
Depierris: You're a good soul, aren't you? Would you refuse an artist's plaintive plea?
Traveler: Alright, alright...
Depierris: Alright, thank you so much! I'll wait here. Just bring them straight back to me once you get them.
Traveler: You're hopeless... Just leave it to me.
Traveler: You can make paints yourself?
Depierris: Hahaha, of course! That's the first thing you should learn as a painter — that's how you retain control over the image you create.
Traveler: Why don't you try a different painting style?
Depierris: That's right. Some of my colleagues thought so too, and they are presently attempting to use some "figurative" methods of painting to produce something more abstract.
Depierris: The most radical amongst them even wish to give up on depicting concrete objects altogether and simply use splotches of paint to express themselves... They call themselves "Neodescriptionists."
Depierris: But I must say that even I cannot quite grasp their work. At most, I can only sense the rhythmic beauty contained within the colored splotches and line work...
Depierris: As for what any given painting really expresses... I can only ask that painter to explain it to me.

## Talk 2

Boucicaut: Hello. What would you like to buy?
Traveler: I'm here for Depierris's paints...
Boucicaut: Oh, you're here to get paints for him? I've got them right here.
Boucicaut: He really does use them up very quickly. You'd think he pours them straight into the water after buying them!
Boucicaut: Well, regardless, here they are. Take them to him, would you?

## Talk 3

Depierris: Traveler, have you gotten the things I need? Hehe. Now then, did you bring paints, or Whopperflower nectar?

## Talk 4

Depierris: Thank you! These paints should last me for a while.
Traveler: Don't spill them all into the water.
Depierris: Into the water? Hahaha. I suppose my painting technique is just as you describe.
Depierris: But only by squeezing the paint out and directly pouring it out onto the canvas before using a carving blade and palette knife will provide me with the touch necessary to make an impact on others.
Depierris: Thanks for your help. I should be able to continue with the aid of these paints. Come over and take a look when you have the time, alright?
Depierris: It is all thanks to your help that my work has started out on the right foot, after all.
Depierris: Once this painting is complete, I hope that you'll be the first to come appreciate it.

## Talk 5

Depierris: This nectar is not bad! Very good — great paint shall surely come of this.
Traveler: What sort of paints do you want to make?
Depierris: Hmm... I'd like to make ones that lean towards warm shades, but with a melancholy touch.
Depierris: They'll also need to be thick enough to allow me to work with compact brushstrokes.
Depierris: Thanks for your help. I should be able to continue with the aid of these paints. Come over and take a look when you have the time, alright?
Depierris: It is all thanks to your help that my work has started out on the right foot, after all.
Depierris: Once this painting is complete, I hope that you'll be the first to come appreciate it.

### Additional Talk 1

Depierris: We cannot be too restricted by concrete forms... We must draw the beauty out and use symbolic methods too...
Depierris: No, no... Still no. This composition is too deliberate...
