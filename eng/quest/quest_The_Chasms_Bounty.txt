# The Chasm's Bounty


## Talk 1

Muning: What happened? He was absent this morning during the headcount. Where on earth is he?
Muning: If the higher-ups find out... I'd be toast.
Muning: Ah, you're here. Good timing...
Paimon: What happened? Why are you sighing?
Muning: *sigh* To tell you the truth, a miner from our camp went missing.
Muning: The Chasm has a complex environment. Though things have stabilized a bit lately, it's still dangerous deep inside. So, we made it a rule to take a headcount every morning and evening.
Muning: Qi Ding — the guy who never misses a chance to brag about his daughter — was absent last night.
Muning: During the headcount, other miners said that they had just met him and that he might return very soon. So I let it go.
Muning: But this morning, he was still nowhere to be found. Other miners looked evasive, so I pressed them for an honest answer. It turned out that Qi Ding hadn't returned the whole night...
Muning: Now we're in big trouble. Don't tell me it's happening again...
Traveler: What is happening again?
Muning: *sigh* This is something that only Ministry personnel should know.
Muning: But since you're the hero who saved Liyue, I think I can make an exception for you.
Muning: This was before The Chasm was sealed... At first, it was just a strange rumor among miners that something in The Chasm could "make their wish come true."
Muning: We had warned them to report to Huishan Hall should they encounter anything unusual.
Muning: Yet some miners tried their luck — They went looking for "The Chasm's Bounty" in secret and ended up going missing one by one.
Muning: When we found them some while later, they'd all gone pretty insane. It took quite some time for them to recover. That was creepy. After the incident, the Qixing decided to seal The Chasm.
Paimon: Could the missing miner be...
Muning: Yes, I suspect Qi Ding got himself into the same situation.
Muning: Should anything happen to him, I'll definitely lose my job. *sigh* What's more, his wife passed away many years ago, and his daughter is now an intern at the Ministry of Civil Affairs. If we can't find him...
Muning: #*sigh* {NICKNAME}, I'm gonna have people put up some missing person posters, but can you help me look for him...
Traveler: Sure.
Muning: Mm, let me think if there's anything noticeable about him. He used to be on the demolitions team, there's always a strong gunpowder smell on him... Hope you find this useful.
Muning: #*sigh* Qi Ding, I warned you not to go down. You aren't like {NICKNAME}...
Traveler: Has something similar happened before?

## Talk 2

Qi Ding: Wh—Where is it? Where is it!
Qi Ding: If I can't find it... *sigh*
Paimon: What's with this strong gunpowder smell? Who are you, and what are you doing here?
Qi Ding: My name is Qi Ding. I—I lost something here. I must find it.
Paimon: Qi Ding? Isn't he the missing miner that Muning talked about?
Paimon: Let's bring him back to the camp.
Qi Ding: No! I'm not coming back!
Qi Ding: I'm not returning unless I find it!
Paimon: Then, what are you looking for?
Qi Ding: I—I'm looking for a toy, a doll of the size of my palm...
Qi Ding: I lost it when I came down into the mine.
Traveler: Do you always bring a toy with you?
Qi Ding: I know it sounds weird, but I had it in case I lost it.
Qi Ding: You don't know how much trouble I went through to get this doll. It's expensive — I'd even call it daylight robbery — and every time the Feiyun Commerce Guild had it in stock, I was in the mine, so I always missed my chance to purchase it.
Qi Ding: But last time, when my daughter saw another kid holding this doll in their arms, she had her eyes fixed on it. My daughter is such a considerate and sweet child — she knows that we aren't well-off, so she never tells me what she wants.
Qi Ding: But a father always knows.
Qi Ding: So I asked my friend to buy one from the Feiyun Commerce Guild and send it to the mine. I carried it with me all the time in case I lost it.
Paimon: Yet that didn't really help.
Qi Ding: *sigh*... Miners like us live off a poor salary. After spending most of it on supporting the family, I ain't got much left. Then, there was this doll that cost a fortune.
Qi Ding: Well, I can always earn more money. B—But I've already written to my daughter to tell her that I've bought her the doll she wanted...
Qi Ding: How am I supposed to face her when I return home this month?
Qi Ding: She never makes any complaints. I know that she wouldn't do so even if I return home empty-handed, but, *sob*, it'll simply break my heart to see the disappointment in her eyes...
Paimon: That's awful...
Paimon: Why don't we help him find the doll?
Traveler: Let's give it a try.
Paimon: But The Chasm's still a pretty dangerous place, so let's return to the camp together first. Then, we'll come back and look for your doll.
Qi Ding: Really? Thank you so much!
Traveler: You brought a toy into the mine?

## Talk 3

Qi Ding: Wh—Where is it? Where is it!
Qi Ding: If I can't find it... *sigh*
Paimon: What's with the strong smell of gunpowder... What are you looking for?
Qi Ding: I—I'm looking for a toy, a doll of the size of my palm...
Qi Ding: I lost it when I came down into the mine.
Traveler: Do you always bring a toy with you?
Qi Ding: I know it sounds weird, but I had it in case I lost it.

Qi Ding: Really? Thank you so much!
Traveler: You brought a toy into the mine?

## Talk 4

Jinwu: Qi Ding, is that you? Where have you been? Muning has even sent men to the camp to look for you...
Jinwu: #{NICKNAME}, you're also here. What's going on?
Qi Ding: M—My toy is missing...
Jinwu: Your toy? What toy? Aren't you a bit too old for this?
Qi Ding: No, it's not mine. It's for my daughter.
Qi Ding: You know, the doll from the Feiyun Commerce Guild — it's about the size of my palm.
Jinwu: Oh, the toy you bought for your daughter.
Qi Ding: Yeah! That's the one!
Jinwu: But I—I lost it...
Jinwu: Is it really necessary to get so upset?
Qi Ding: Hey! That toy is for my daughter, and I just bought it! My poor little girl, she didn't even get to take a look...
Qi Ding: How am I supposed to tell her now that I lost her doll...
Jinwu: Huh...
Jinwu: #Where did you find him, {NICKNAME}? Was it in The Chasm?
Traveler: Yes...
Jinwu: *sigh* The Chasm is like a complex labyrinth. The deeper you go, the creepier it becomes.
Jinwu: Qi Ding has always been a steady and dependable person. Seems being trapped down there has made him both emotionally and mentally vulnerable.
Jinwu: I'll send him up later. He will be fine with some rest.
Qi Ding: No, I'm not going back. I won't go unless I find the doll.
Jinwu: The doll...
Paimon: #No worries. {NICKNAME} and Paimon will look for it.
Paimon: Finding the doll should help calm him down a bit.
Qi Ding: R—Really? Will you help me look for my doll?
Traveler: Of course!
Qi Ding: There's only so many places I went to when I descended into the mines.
Qi Ding: *sob* Please, you must find the doll.
Jinwu: *sigh* So be it.
Jinwu: I'm gonna bring him up. Muning was like a cat on hot bricks when he didn't show up during the headcount.
Jinwu: Now with him back, Muning can finally be at ease.
Jinwu: By the way, please exercise caution when you go down. To be honest, um, it's no biggie if you don't find the doll.
Traveler: I'll help.

## Talk 5

Suspicious Object: (There is a dampened chest that smells of gunpowder.)
Suspicious Object: (You find messy footprints around it.)
Paimon: Huh, Paimon thought Qi Ding would've left the doll in this chest. The gunpowder smell here is identical to that of Qi Ding's.
Paimon: But there's only some damp gunpowder inside it.
Paimon: Huh, a sheet of paper? What does it say?
Suspicious Object: "...I ran into that rock again. I bet it has to do with the sealing of the mine..."
Suspicious Object: "...Now that she's landed a job at the Ministry of Civil Affairs, she needs money on many fronts. I can't afford to have my work interrupted as it was two years ago when they closed the mine."
Suspicious Object: "...Qi Ding, for your daughter's sake, you have to blow that rock up!"
Paimon: Looks like someone tore it out of a notebook.
Paimon: Could the person be...
Traveler: It must be Qi Ding.
Paimon: Why did Qi Ding bring the gunpowder here?
Paimon: Was he going to blow something up? Well, that's not the topic for now...
Traveler: Where's the toy?
Paimon: *sigh* Where on earth is it?
Traveler: The doll isn't here...

## Talk 6

Paimon: Huh, wh—who are you?
Paimon: Why is there a little girl in The Chasm?
Qi Nan: Me? My name is Qi Nan. I—I'm Qi Ding's daughter.
Paimon: Qi Ding's daughter?
Qi Nan: Yeah, my father is, uh, a miner working in The Chasm. He's a great person — my mother died shortly after giving birth to me, so my father brought me up on his own.
Qi Nan: It's so dark down in The Chasm... (But for my sake, father endured the fear and stayed here, exerting himself.)
Paimon: So, why are you here?
Qi Nan: I—I miss my father. He's very busy in the mines and usually comes home only once every month.
Qi Nan: When he's away, I'm left alone at home... (I'd be so lonely and scared should anything happen.)
Qi Nan: But you see, everything will be fine if I can go down into the mine. (When I'm in the camp, I'll be with father every day. He can take care of me and protect me.)
Traveler: But it's dangerous in here.
Paimon: #Yep... {NICKNAME} has a point. This place is super dangerous.
Paimon: Let us bring you back to the camp...
Qi Nan: No way! I snuck in here. If my father finds out, he'll get so mad that he won't ever allow me to come out and play again.
Qi Nan: Oh, right! Aren't you looking for the doll?
Qi Nan: I know where it is... Hee-hee, follow me.
Traveler: You'd better go back.

## Talk 7

Qi Nan: I have no idea what I'm gonna do if someone bullies me when father's away.
Qi Nan: How I wish father could stay at home longer...
Qi Nan: If he's always there with me, I can stop pretending to be the "considerate child." Instead, I may allow myself to seek some attention, and be a naive — and even a bit spoiled — daughter.
Qi Nan: Uh... The toy? It's right in front of you.
Qi Nan: Father must be very anxious after losing the toy. We must find it soon.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Qi Ding!
Qi Ding: #Huh? If it isn't the famous {NICKNAME} and... your flying companion.
Paimon: "Flying companion"! How rude!
Paimon: Paimon's, uh, Paimon!
Qi Ding: #I'm sorry. Paimon, {NICKNAME}, are you... looking for me?
Paimon: Huh, have you forgotten? You asked us to help you find the toy, but we only found a chest full of dampened gunpowder.
Qi Ding: *sigh*... My apologies. Something must've affected me while I was stuck in The Chasm. Felt like I was in daze, to be honest, one that I've only just recovered from a bit after being sent back up.
Qi Ding: Jinwu said I made a scene down there, crying and shouting... H—How embarrassing.
Qi Ding: But now that you mentioned the gunpowder, I remember it. I did plan to... blow up the "Wish Granter."
Traveler: The "Wish Granter"?
Qi Ding: Before the mine was sealed, a few miners who went down into the mine came back saying that they found a Wish Granter that grants whatever wish you might have.
Paimon: To think such a miracle exists... Paimon's just curious, by the way — is the Wish Granter still there?
Qi Ding: I believe so. It's a very huge rock floating among other giant boulders. Also, it emits a faint light...
Paimon: Mm, this sounds somewhat familiar...
Traveler: It's the huge crystal that Zhiqiong and we came across.
Qi Ding: Ah? Did you run into the Wish Granter as well? You'd better be careful when you get close.
Qi Ding: Some miners went insane because of it, which led to the Qixing sealing the mine. I couldn't find a stable job for years because of it.
Qi Ding: I ran into that rock again this time. If this part of the mine got sealed because of it once more, I would lose my job again and end up taking on poorly paid gigs at the harbor.
Qi Ding: So I decided to blow that rock up.
Qi Ding: But... after I went down, the closer I got, the more intense my headache grew. I couldn't even think straight...
Qi Ding: I even saw — no, I think it was just a hallucination. Anyway, I heard them saying that I'd have been in dire peril if you hadn't shown up.
Qi Ding: Thank you so much.
Paimon: No need to thank us. We're just doing as we should!
Paimon: Oh, don't forget this. We found the doll...
Paimon: It looks ragged. Paimon doesn't know if it's the one that you lost.
Qi Ding: Wh—Why do you have it!? Where did you find it?
Paimon: This is the doll that you asked us to look for.
Qi Ding: Did I ask you to look for this doll? How weird! I bought it at the Feiyun Commerce Guild some time back. It cost me a fortune.
Qi Ding: Well, it made a good gift for my daughter anyway. But as she grew older, she no longer needed it. I thought it'd be a waste to just throw such an expensive doll away, so I carried it with me as a talisman.
Qi Ding: But I lost it a few years back when they evacuated the mine in a hurry.
Qi Ding: How did you manage to find it?
Traveler: This is strange...
Qi Ding: *sigh* I'd planned to work a few more years in the mine while my health allowed, but The Chasm is far more dangerous than I thought.
Qi Ding: I don't think I'll ever go down into the mine again.
Qi Ding: By the way, please tell Muning that I shan't dare go down into the mine anymore.
Paimon: No problem. Just remember to take Qi Nan with you when you go home.
Qi Ding: Qi Nan? She lives in Liyue Harbor and is very busy with work at the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Why would she be here?
Qi Ding: But you are right. She has grown up and I've grown old. I should spend more time with her.
Paimon: That's not what we mean. Paimon means the little girl over there...
Qi Ding: The little girl?
Qi Ding: Is there anyone there? Ah, come on, don't you go scaring me. This isn't funny.
Qi Ding: Alright, you know what? I'll go home right away. Please remember to tell Muning that I'm not going down into the mine anymore.
Traveler: This is getting creepy...
Traveler: What is that?

## Talk 9

Qi Ding: Thank you, Traveler.

## Talk 10

Paimon: The doll looks somewhat ragged... Anyway, let's bring it to Qi Ding.
Paimon: Oh, don't forget to bring Qi Nan along. He must be very happy to see his daughter.
Paimon: Qi Nan, huh, where is she? She just vanished suddenly.
Traveler: ...Let's return to the camp first.
Paimon: Mm... This is pretty weird. But let's bring the doll to Qi Ding and ask him about it.
Paimon: Ohh, Paimon hopes that nothing happens to Qi Nan in the meantime...
Traveler: Something doesn't seem to add up.
Paimon: Yup, when did Qi Nan disappear? Paimon didn't even hear any sound...
Paimon: This does feel pretty weird. Why don't we bring the doll to Qi Ding and tell him about his daughter?

## Talk 11

Qi Nan: Ah, why did you chase them away...
Qi Nan: They were playing with me. Hee-hee, they tried to catch me but failed each time. It was super fun.
Paimon: It's not fun if they catch you!
Qi Nan: No worries... They won't. Oh, right, aren't you looking for the doll?
Qi Nan: Hehe, it's right there.

## Talk 12

Muning: You two found Qi Ding, right? Jinwu told me already.
Muning: So he said he wasn't going to work in the mine anymore? OK, he needs to go home and rest.
Muning: Are you saying that a "Wish Granter" caused all this? That's nonsense! I bet it has to do with the depressing atmosphere in the mine. Anyone could develop some mental issues down there.
Muning: I dare not imagine what would happen to Qi Ding hadn't you been there. It took very long for those hallucinated miners to recover.
Muning: They don't even know what happened to them.
Muning: You've been running around in The Chasm lately. Do be careful.
Muning: You didn't see the state Qi Ding was in when he was sent up. He was shouting in tears about his daughter...
Paimon: Ah, speaking of his daughter, we met Qi Nan.
Muning: Qi Nan? Oh, that's Qi Ding's daughter.
Muning: Did anything happen to her?
Paimon: His daughter — the little girl — looked for the doll with us down there. It's good to know that she came out of The Chasm safe and sound.
Muning: Qi Ding's daughter, Qi Nan? A little girl? What are you talking about?
Muning: Qi Ding's daughter made it into the Ministry of Civil Affairs this year. She's all grown up now. Besides, the Ministry is looking for experts to investigate the incident in The Chasm. She is too busy to come here...
Paimon: But we saw...
Muning: I don't care what you saw...
Muning: Just pretend you didn't see anything.
Muning: Alright, Qi Ding is back safe and sound. You should also, um, get some rest.

## Talk 13

Muning: What happened? He was absent this morning during the headcount. Where on earth is he?

Muning: The Chasm has a complex environment. Though things have stabilized a bit lately, it's still dangerous deep inside. So, we made it a rule to take a headcount every morning and evening.
Muning: But we haven't seen him since last night...
Traveler: Qi Ding?
Paimon: The miner who keeps talking about his daughter.
Muning: Yeah, that's him!
Muning: During the headcount last night, other miners said that they had just met him and that he might return very soon. So I let it go.
