# Bloodstained Flower of Iron

## Piece 1: Bloodstained Flower of Iron

Description: A dried flower stained black with blood and now as hard as steel. Probably some sort of a memento for its former master.
Story:

Originally an exquisite silver goblet with gold engravings depicting the feats of a chivalrous knight.
But blood and smoke have stained the cup beyond recognition.

Covered in blood, the knight who slayed demons returned from the scourged battlefield,
Only to find that those awaiting his rescue were nowhere to be found among the burning, collapsed houses.

Defeated, the Bloodstained Knight took the smoke-blackened goblet,
and vowed to rid the world of monsters, of poverty and of evil.

## Piece 2: Bloodstained Black Plume

Description: A raven feather pinned to a knight's cape. Countless bloodstains have dyed it pitch black.
Story:

One of the countless raven feathers stuck to the Bloodstained Knight.
For where there is blood, ravens shall follow.

In the end the Bloodstained Knight could no longer tell
whether the blood that stained him was his own or that of his enemies.

Eventually, on his long journey filled with bloodshed, he came to a realization:
His path of so-called chivalry had turned him from the white knight he used to be into the monster he had now become.
His only followers were the ravens drawn to the bloodshed he left in his wake.

## Piece 3: Bloodstained Final Hour

Description: A timepiece once used by a knight. The liquid inside has dried up, rendering it useless.
Story:

A luxurious platinum mask that once belonged to a knight of noble birth.
The dark stains of dry blood are now a permanent part of its appearance.

As the Bloodstained Knight reached out to help a person in need after slaying the monster,
The way she cowered in fear made the knight realize:
He was now a monster himself.
Tainted by the blood and cruelty of his drawn-out war.

"Shield me from the eyes"
"Of those I vowed to protect."
"And shield them from the horrors I am bound to effect."

## Piece 4: Bloodstained Chevalier's Goblet

Description: The dark metallic vessel owned by the Bloodstained Knight. Its exterior has been stained as black as the night by smoke and coagulated blood.
Story:

A common white flower given to the knight by a rescued damsel.
It is dried and hardened by the blood from all his bloodshed.

Thanking him for his valor, the damsel offered a reward.
He turned down all she gave, save for a pure white flower.

"For a knight, chivalry is its own reward."
"This flower shall be my medal. That is all I need."

He wore the flower upon his heart.
Like his armor, it was stained as black as a winter's night.
Like his heart, it was hardened like a tempered blade.

## Piece 5: Bloodstained Iron Mask

Description: The iron mask the knight used to conceal their identity. Many have speculated about the face behind the mask.
Story:

Deep in the abyss, where celestial bodies cast no light,
the Bloodstained Knight kept this timepiece, though time had lost all meaning.

At an end was the Bloodstained Knight's story,
for he realized there was no place for him on this earth.
He ventured into the fallen ancient kingdom, and died in battle in the monsters' lair.
At the bottom of the world, he learned the origin of the monsters that destroyed the ancient kingdom.

"The ancient kingdom was wrongfully cursed,"
"Turning its inhabitants into monsters."
"The code of chivalry tolerates not such injustice."
"If Abyss be thy name, I pledge to you my loyalty."
