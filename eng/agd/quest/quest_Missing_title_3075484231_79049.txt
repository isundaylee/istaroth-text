## Talk 1

Read (Paimon): What's a diary doing hidden in the corner like this?
Read (Paimon): It turns out that the huge stone slab outside is the one that Idyia gave to the painter as a canvas!
Read (Paimon): Hmm, it seems not only had he found landscapes he loved in the Veluriyam Mirage, but also made friends with Water Droplets and found some new inspirations for his paintings!
Traveler: Quite the fortunate encounter.
Read (Paimon): Eek! Now that you mention it, Paimon's heard of some people that go nuts after a failure! They just keep trying harder and harder until they lose themselves...
Read (Paimon): Thanks to the painting tools Idyia provided and the company of the Water Droplets, he stayed on the right track!
Traveler: Better than practicing to the point of obsession...
