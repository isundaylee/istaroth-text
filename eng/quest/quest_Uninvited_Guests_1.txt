# Uninvited Guests


## Talk 1

Paimon: Albedo! We're baaaack!
Paimon: Huh? It seems that he's not here.
Paimon: Is he out investigating something? Or maybe he went to make some mysterious drawings?
Sucrose: Ah! It's you!
Paimon: Oh, if it isn't Sucrose! What are you doing here?
Sucrose: I'm in the final stage of my research. I have five hours and twenty-six minutes of leisure time today.
Sucrose: So I came here looking for you to inquire about previously discussed matters.
Paimon: You tell time very accurately! Are you a human clock?
Sucrose: No, no, it's nothing worth your praise. You're too kind...
Paimon: That wasn't a compliment...
Sucrose: C—Can I ask you a question, Traveler? I made a request regarding investigating Mr. Albedo's secret. Have you made any progress?
Paimon: Correct me if I'm wrong, but it's been over a week since we talked about it.
Traveler: I thought you'd forgotten about it.
Sucrose: What...!?
Sucrose: O—Over a week? I clearly... Ah!
Sucrose: I've been so absorbed in my research. That matter of ours had completely slipped my mind...
Paimon: How can your sense of time be so strong and so weak at the same time...?
Sucrose: S—So! Do you know what it is?
Traveler: Yeah, you could say that.
Sucrose: That's great. Could you tell me?
Traveler: What do you think, Paimon?
Paimon: Umm... Telling her shouldn't really matter.
Paimon: She can take a look, too. Just no touching...
Sucrose: Wait. What are you talking about?
Sucrose: What's this?
Traveler: This is Albedo's secret.
Paimon: It's a super powerful sword. Don't touch it with your bare hands!
Sucrose: Uh... This is...
Sucrose: Ah! Th—This is... I've never seen...
Paimon: Hehe, look all you want! Not sure why, but even Paimon feels a strange sense of achievement.
Sucrose: Astounding! It's the first time I've heard of such a mysterious weapon.
Sucrose: I can faintly feel the power coursing through the sword... It's like a living creature.
Paimon: Is it such a distinct feeling?
Sucrose: This may be due to my alchemist training.
Sucrose: I don't dare to say anything for sure, but the "flow" of power is very noticeable. Although this description isn't the most precise... N—Normally, I wouldn't define things like that.
Sucrose: Please, believe me! I don't usually use such ambiguous terms!
Paimon: Okay, okay, we got it.
Sucrose: Traveler, could you use this sword in battle?
Sucrose: I'd like to learn more about it, but I'm unable to use it myself. I can only ask for your assistance.
Traveler: Let's keep a low profile. We can't let Albedo know.
Paimon: Let's look around for the right spot!
Traveler: We should find a place hidden from view.
Traveler: This is the answer you seek.
Traveler: My investigation was successful.

## Talk 2

Sucrose: Remarkable! This weapon is like no other...
Sucrose: You're also extraordinary. No matter if it's your fighting stance or the momentum of your swing, it's perfect.
Traveler: You flatter me.
Sucrose: This sword is special. I didn't want to go too deep into the research, and yet I couldn't take my eyes off of it.
Paimon: Well, Paimon thinks that's one of your own special qualities, not the sword's...
Sucrose: Clearly this is a mysterious yet dangerous and enticing sword.
Sucrose: Mr. Albedo must have great confidence in you to have entrusted you with such an important item.
Traveler: I'm as surprised as you.
Paimon: Well, you've earned his trust with your abilities.
Sucrose: I agree with Paimon.
Sucrose: However, the sword hadn't absorbed much energy before it was handed to you... Huh, how did Mr. Albedo recognize its uniqueness among a pile of other items in storage?
Paimon: A flash of brilliance often doesn't make sense. For example, Paimon's appetite for Sticky Honey Roast!
Sucrose: Ah... Which reminds me, I didn't eat much today.
Sucrose: I went looking for you right after completing my experiment. Then, on the way, I ran into an adventurer trapped in the snow. I spent quite some time saving him...
Sucrose: *rumbling*
Traveler: Did your stomach just rumble?
Sucrose: Ah... Ahhhh! N—No, it's not like that...
Paimon: Don't be so shy! Just say what's on your mind!
Sucrose: Um, um...
Paimon: Let Paimon help you out: Paimon's hungry! We should grab something to eat!
Traveler: I'm hungry!
Sucrose: I'm... I'm hungry. I could really go for a...
Sucrose: Oh... ah... I'm just a little embarassed...
Paimon: Nothing to be ashamed of! Admitting that you're hungry makes the food taste better.
Sucrose: Huh, is that so?
Paimon: Of course! Let's get moving! There must be some food back at the camp.
Paimon: It'd be lovely to have some Sticky Honey Roast to keep us warm in this icy weather.
Traveler: I want to eat!
Traveler: I'm grateful for the faith he puts in me.

## Talk 3

Reckless Pallad: U—Ugh... Argh...
Sucrose: M—Mr. Pallad!?
Sucrose: You still haven't gone back?
Paimon: Isn't that the hotheaded adventurer from Mondstadt? Did he come here with Cyrus to explore the Snowy Mountain, too?
Reckless Pallad: I'm f—f—f—freezing, ACHOO!
Sucrose: Have you been here since I rescued you from the snow pit!?
Reckless Pallad: I wanted to leave, b—but I got lost. I'm sorry...
Reckless Pallad: U—Ugh... It's so c—cold that I c—can't move...
Sucrose: Mr. Pallad, a trip to this mountain requires solid preparation. You shouldn't have treated it so lightly.
Traveler: We'll take him back down.
Sucrose: I'd appreciate the assistance. I'm afraid that, in his current state, he won't be able to walk on his own...
Paimon: Even if we can't, we won't just leave him here, right?
Sucrose: You're right... My apologies, Traveler. I'm sure he feels bad about the situation.
???: He's the least of your concerns right now. You should be worried about yourself!
Paimon: Ah! The Fatui strike again!
Vadim: You must've already figured out why we're here.
Vadim: We won't let you go unless you give us that sword.
Sucrose: No! Please, don't give them the sword.
Traveler: Of course, I wouldn't hand it over to them!
Paimon: That's the spirit! Let's knock 'em down!
Sucrose: Mr. Pallad, I'll take you to a safe place! Quickly!
Vadim: So naive! We won't let any witness escape!
Vadim: This sword will make a fine gift for Her Excellency, Harbinger Signora!
Traveler: Don't even think about putting your hands on it!

## Talk 5

Albedo: I heard the ruckus and came over to check. So it was you who made all this noise.
Albedo: What happened? Did you get into a fight?
Sucrose: M—Mr. Albedo... I—I didn't mean to...
Albedo: Aren't you supposed to be organizing documents? Why did you come here all of a sudden?
Albedo: And you got into a fight with such a dangerous opponent — in this terrain...
Traveler: I—I also got into a fight, I'm sorry...
Paimon: Well now even Paimon feels guilty...
Sucrose: Uh... Ah... I only... I'm sorry, I was just passing by.
Albedo: Huh, I reckon you've been led astray by yet another thing that attracted your attention.
Traveler: I told Sucrose about the sword, my bad.
Albedo: You told her everything?
Paimon: We just told her about the sword's properties and origin. We didn't let her touch it! We know better than that.
Albedo: *sigh* Never mind. We couldn't have kept her in the dark for too long anyway.
Albedo: Sucrose is naturally drawn to obscure knowledge and mystery. She is great alchemist material, indeed.
Sucrose: Ah... Uh... I promise I won't be causing trouble anymore. I swear on the quadruple-size Sweet Flower seeds I just propagated!
Albedo: It's not trouble that worries me, I'm only concerned with your safety. You must be more careful next time.
Albedo: *sigh* Anyway, what's going on with that adventurer crouching over there?
Sucrose: I took it upon myself to protect Mr. Pallad during the battle. He should be alright.
Reckless Pallad: I'm... I'm freezing...
Paimon: He must've caught a cold during the fight.
Sucrose: Ahhhh, I didn't consider that possibility... It's my oversight, my apologies!
Sucrose: Mr. Albedo, I'll check on him!
Albedo: Sure.
Paimon: Sucrose may seem a bit rigid, but she's a good kid with a heart of gold.
Traveler: I wouldn't call her a kid if I were your size.
Paimon: Can't disagree.
Albedo: That girl... Let her out of your sight, and she winds up in the strangest places...
Traveler: Isn't that just what young people do in general?
Albedo: True.
Traveler: Sucrose didn't mean to cause trouble. Don't be too hard on her.
Albedo: Don't worry, I'm not angry.
Paimon: Huh? There seems to be a shiny thingy on the sword.
Albedo: Huh? Another change...
Albedo: The sword's power is much stronger than before. How did that happen?
Traveler: We fought with Fatui.
Paimon: There were some ferocious characters among those Fatui soldiers. We've never seen them before.
Albedo: So it's the energy it's never encountered before...
Albedo: It caused the sword to greatly grow in strength.

## Talk 6

Albedo: The dragon's power... the dragon's life force can revive withered plants and empower them to such a degree...
Albedo: Inconceivable!
Paimon: How could a dead tree stump turn out to be such a monster!?
Paimon: Paimon almost got swallowed!
Paimon: Anyway, why hasn't anything like that happened before?
Albedo: Most probably it's because the sword fell to the ground. The impact must've caused its power to leak out.
Reckless Pallad: It's my fault! Don't make me leave! I beg you!
Reckless Pallad: I promise I'll stay put!
Sucrose: Ah, Mr. Pallad... There's no need to go into a fetal position...
Albedo: *sigh*
Albedo: This Cryo Regisvine having originally withered up and died here... Is it because it hadn't been able to absorb the ambient corruption?
Albedo: After you purified the corruption, the resulting pure elemental energy not only revived it, but also enhanced it.
Albedo: Pure life force will cause it to constantly regenerate itself... together with its fighting spirit.
Traveler: The situation looks worse than expected...
Albedo: I also haven't encountered any similar incidents.
Albedo: Yet I must admit that a phenomenon of this rarity, although unexpected, is a valuable discovery.
Albedo: Sucrose.
Sucrose: Ah, yes!
Albedo: Keep an eye on that adventurer. Take him back to the camp.
Sucrose: Yes sir!
Albedo: As for the matters at hand, I beg your pardon, Traveler... but I must ask for your further assistance.
Traveler: I'll do what I can to help.
Paimon: Such an unexpected mess, and we're the only ones who can clean it up. *sigh* It must be because we keep outdoing ourselves!
Traveler: I wouldn't have expected that. Is it because I'm too powerful?
