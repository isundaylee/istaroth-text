Yi Xian: Yi Zhu, I miss Mommy again... I wanna accompany her to see the Xiao Market...
Yi Zhu: Don't cry, Xian... I'll go with you this year, alright?
Yi Zhu: Let's go buy some toys, check out the Xiao Lanterns, and watch the fireworks. I'll carry you on my back if you get tired.
Yi Xian: Yi Zhu... *sobs*
Yi Xian: Then... will you teach me how to make Xiao Lanterns this year? I'd like to make Mommy one.
Yi Zhu: Of course I can. We made one for her together last year. This year, I'll teach you, and you'll be able to make one yourself!
Yi Xian: Yep!
Yi Zhu: When Mommy sees your Xiao Lantern, her spirit will return, together with all those other heroes. Then, we'll welcome her back with big smiles on our faces!
Yi Xian: Yeah!

## Talk 1

Yi Zhu: Come on Yi Xian, there's a good girl. It's home time...
Yi Xian: I'm not going home! I'm going to look for Mommy!
Yi Zhu: But Mommy isn't coming home...
Yi Xian: *sobs* Why won't Mommy come home... Does Mommy not love us anymore?
Yi Zhu: Hey, don't say such silly things...
Yi Xian: But, but... I know I saw the lady with black clothes bring Mommy here... *sobs*
Yi Zhu: Yi Xian, what happened was... Mommy is one of the stars in the sky now.
Yi Xian: You mean Mommy isn't sleeping anymore? ...You're lying, I don't believe you!
Yi Zhu: I'm telling the truth, Yi Xian... Listen, how about we wait till nighttime and I take you up onto the roof? When you see the starlight, you will feel Mommy's loving eyes looking down...

## Talk 2

Yi Xian: ...Mommy always used to take us to Xiao Market...
Yi Zhu: Yeah! Mommy would buy toys for us, take us to see the Xiao Lanterns... And she'd carry you when you got tired...
Yi Xian: ...Yi Zhu, I miss Mommy.
Yi Zhu: Yi Xian... Don't cry, let's make a Xiao Lantern for Mommy, shall we?
Yi Xian: Huh? But I thought Xiao Lanterns were to remember the heroes who look after us...
Yi Zhu: You're right. Well, our mommy was a hero and she looked after us, didn't she?
Yi Zhu: So come on, wipe your tears away â€” let's welcome back Mommy's spirit and all the other heroes with big smiles on our faces!
Yi Xian: Alright!
