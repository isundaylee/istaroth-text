Your new heart has limitless potential
And you have wielded it with bravery and honor
I grant you the title of "Sentinel Knight"
Like the four pillars of strength
You will continue to safeguard the glory of Khaenri'ah
The glory of Khaenri'ah...
Our land, our dignity
And every comrade who fights alongside us
The Night Kingdom is almost destroyed
Our fallen soldiers, your comrades...
They have nowhere to go
What are you doing!?
Are you taking all their souls with you!?
You're just an ordinary person
You can't bear that kind of burden!
No hero should have to wander alone
The curse of immortality...
Using immortality to fight death...
Using my rules against me...
Make your choice
Reject your rules
Or allow me to trigger the paradox
The curse of immortality must stand
Use it to fulfill your final wish
Well fought, my lord
Thank you for everything
This time, let's go together
Yes
Let's go together
