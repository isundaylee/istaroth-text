# The Ritou Road


## Talk 1

Harrison: Well, so this stuff's finally arrived...
Harrison: Took them long enough...
Harrison: Agh, and this box is broken on one side, too!
Harrison: Come on! I told him to be careful. Let's just hope nothing inside is broken...
Harrison: Phew, looks like none of the bottles broke...
Harrison: Eh? Why's this bottle's cap loose? You have to unscrew it first before installing it, come on...
Harrison: *cough* And these alcohol-making ingredients have too strong a flavor, let's move them out first...
Harrison: Eh!? What are all these slimes doing here?

## Talk 2

Harrison: Thank you, Traveler, thank you so much for your help...
Harrison: If not for you, this place would have been my grave today...
Traveler: You set this camp up?
Harrison: Um, you could say so.
Harrison: I mean, you know that doing business is hard here on Ritou. This camp is... well, you can consider it a little trick of mine.
Harrison: Some days back, I commissioned a... friend to ship me some alcohol-making ingredients from Mondstadt.
Harrison: He then got a test batch of new product from the Dawn Winery, which was just shipped here.
Harrison: But he hasn't been all that careful, so some of the boxes are broken, and the cap on a bottle of alcohol-making ingredients was loosened.
Harrison: I decided to unscrew it so that I could then reinstall it.
Harrison: But I never expected that a whole bunch of slimes would come jumping out of the unscrewed cap. What a strange occurrence.
Traveler: Brewing ingredients from the Dawn Winery, huh...
Harrison: Ah, it doesn't matter right now. As for the ingredients, I'll settle with that fellow the next time he comes by.
Harrison: You've saved my life, and I owe you something for it. Take these first, then.
Harrison: That aside, you see that small boat over there? That's another one of my little tricks.
Harrison: Using that boat, you can sneak over to Narukami Island from here. Convenient, huh?
Traveler: And why would I need to "sneak"...
Harrison: Ah, you see, this is what they call "expecting the unexpected."
Harrison: Well, I need to go back and take stock of those goods, so I can't stay here long. Once again, thank you so much, Traveler.
Harrison: Looks like I'll have to change up my pick-up spot.
Traveler: What are you up to here?
Harrison: I'm, ah, moving goods! Moving goods...
