Traveler: Your fish...
Butrus: Caught and sold on the same day! Fresh fish! Pay purely for the weight, no tricks!
Butrus: Look at these fish and shrimp! All fat and fresh! Press on them and they bounce back, probably with enough force to push you into the sea!
Butrus: I'd have gotten a full scholarship if the Akademiya opened a fishing school. If they graded on freshness, I'd be awarded all of the degrees.
