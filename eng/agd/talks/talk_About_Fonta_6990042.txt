Traveler: About Fonta...
Paimon: Fonta tastes amazing, don't you think?
Traveler: Yep. It's so refreshing, especially when you down the whole thing in one big gulp.
Paimon: Can you buy a glass for Paimon? Paimon's always wanted to try that thing.
Traveler: What thing?
Paimon: Just buy it, you'll see in a minute!
Paimon: Glug glug glug glug...
Paimon: Ahhhhh.
Paimon: That's what those drunkards do after they clink their glasses together. Paimon's been itching to try it for ages!
Traveler: Don't imitate them, Paimon... It's not a good look on you.
