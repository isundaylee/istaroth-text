# Into the Sunlight


## Talk 1

Paimon: Didn't Lyney say that Lynette and Freminet were recovering at the Hotel Bouffes d'ete? Paimon wonders how they're doing... Maybe we should go check on them!

## Talk 2

Lyney: "Father," let me explain...
The Knave: Out of my way.
Lyney: "Father"...
The Knave: You chose to conceal a threat to the House, and for that, you must be punished.
The Knave: Overall, however, I suppose your wrongdoing is hardly the most egregious of the bunch, so I'll deal with your punishments later. As for right now, the more pressing concerns are the traitors among us.
Filliol: By traitors... do you mean us?
Nanteuil: "Father," let me explain. We didn't mean to—
The Knave: Foltz, why don't you share what you heard.
Foltz: Yes, "Father."
Foltz: Secret midnight meeting number 3. Participants: Filliol, Nanteuil, Sotto, Tadie...
Foltz: Nanteuil clearly said, "If only 'Father' wasn't the one who took us in."
Foltz: Sotto added, "I'm sick of this life. I just want to live as a normal person."
Foltz: Filliol was the worst of them all. She called us crazies and said a bunch of mean things about "Father"...
Filliol: I did not!
Filliol: You're... You're lying! Foltz is trying to frame us!
Foltz: It's not like I'm the only one who heard those things. After that, you and Tadie and a bunch of other people started talking about Clervie. You were using all those things Clervie brought up as an excuse to question "Father."
Foltz: "We're birds locked in a cage. The only way out is to destroy it." That's what you said, wasn't it?
Filliol: You little... You just want me gone, don't you! What did I ever do to you, huh!?
Filliol: And you, Chapleau... Have you forgotten who stood by your sickbed, watched over you, and changed your dressings? C'mon, let's hear it, then — what's your reason for all this?
Chapleau: ...
Foltz: You're wrong, Filliol.
Foltz: We don't want you to die. You're our family.
Filliol: Liar. You wouldn't be doing this if that were the case. So, why? Why have you backed us into a corner?
Foltz: We all live in the House of the Hearth. You know the type of work we do, Filliol.
Foltz: A single betrayal can cost dozens of us our lives. It's not like it's never happened before. That kind of thing is hard to forget.
Foltz: That's why the House of the Hearth cannot tolerate any form of betrayal. Ever since we came to Poisson, you've had seven secret meetings. A lot of the things you talked about really crossed the line.
Filliol: You've been spying on us for half a month? Wait a second, now that I think about it... The move to Poisson was just a way to make it easier to spy on us, wasn't it? 'Cause we were all in one place! You've had this planned all along...
Chapleau: Filliol, Nanteuil, I'm sorry...
Chapleau: I owe you both my life. I owe Clervie too. If it weren't for all your help after I got poisoned, I wouldn't be standing here today.
Chapleau: If this were any other situation, I would do anything to repay that kindness, even if it cost me my life. But, rules are rules. I'm sorry, my hands are tied.
Filliol: Why... *sobbing*... Why...
Nanteuil: That's enough, Filliol. We made a mistake, and we should own up to it. We broke the rules — plain and simple, and now we have to face the consequences.
Nanteuil: I'm sorry, Chapleau, Foltz. I'm sorry, "Father."
Nanteuil: We... accept our punishment.
The Knave: Chapleau, according to the rules of the House of the Hearth, how should these traitors be punished?
Chapleau: All those who betray the House pay with their lives.
The Knave: And so it shall be.
Filliol: *sobbing*...
Lyney: "Father"! Please wait!
The Knave: Something you want to say, Lyney?
Lyney: ...Please reconsider, "Father." What Filliol and the others did... Does it really count as betrayal?
Lyney: We all come from broken families. From the very first day we joined the House of the Hearth, we wanted nothing more than to make it a real home.
Lyney: But the truth is... none of us know what a real home should look like.
Lyney: I'm not saying I have all the answers. All I know is this — killing Filliol and the others may uphold the rules, but doing so will only bring us further away from being a real family than we've ever been.
Lyney: So, please, "Father"... Please reconsider!
Lynette: I agree with Lyney.
Freminet: "Father," please...
Nanteuil: Lyney, you...
Chapleau: I also agree with Lyney.
The Knave: ...
The Knave: An order, once given, cannot be rescinded.
The Knave: However, given the extent of your determination, I suppose we shall have to go about this a different way... Draw your weapons, and face me.
Lyney: Our weapons...?
Lynette: "Father," are you referring to a duel?
The Knave: Precisely. The rules of the House will not be altered. Traitors must be punished.
The Knave: However, resolving disputes with a duel is also one of our rules, one that also applies to me. Demonstrate a sufficient showing of strength, and I shall offer a concession.
Freminet: Wait... Beat... "Father" in a duel...?
Foltz: Impossible. "Father" is way too strong, even for Lyney.
Paimon: #Did you hear that, Traveler?
Paimon: Lyney and the others have to duel The Knave! What should we do? Can they really win something like that?
Paimon: If they lose, those people from the House are really gonna be executed... Hey, are you listening?
Traveler: (Is executing them really what she wants?)
Traveler: Don't you... want to say a proper goodbye at least?
The Knave: Anger makes you impulsive. Sorrow causes you to waver.
Traveler: (Back then, she never actually answered my question.)
Traveler: (But that makes the answer pretty obvious, doesn't it?)
Paimon: Looking at that expression on her face, she seems really serious about this. Guess that means there's no chance she's throwing the duel on purpose, huh...
Traveler: (There's no way The Knave will lose on purpose. Although...)
Lyney: When guests are around, families are often on their best behavior... and any disputes are less likely to escalate...
The Knave: When the time comes, make the choice that you deem most appropriate in the situation, and lend your help to the House of the Hearth.
Paimon: #What's wrong, Traveler? Hey, where are you going—
Lyney: #Traveler?
Traveler: I'd like to see for myself what the Fourth of the Fatui Harbingers can do.
Paimon: You're asking to join the duel against The Knave!?
Traveler: If that's okay.
The Knave: I'll allow it. We do have a ready-made dueling ring at our disposal, after all.
The Knave: All I would advise is this — keep a firm grasp on your weapon, and give it your all. Any less, and you may just lose your life.

## Talk 3

The Knave: I believe we can end things here. It's not often that we get to enjoy the company of guests, after all. We wouldn't want things to get too out of hand.
Lyney: *coughing*
Lynette: Brother, are you alright?
Freminet: Lyney...
The Knave: Given that I am the victor of this duel... As agreed, the punishment stands.
Filliol: No...
Nanteuil: I never thought things would end like this...
The Knave: However, everyone involved in the duel demonstrated a remarkable level of strength and determination. In light of this, I'm prepared to change the method of execution.
The Knave: Heloir, the bottled flames I gave you for safekeeping... Do you still have them?
Heloir: Y—Yes! I wasn't sure what they were for, but I've kept them super safe! I didn't lose a single one!
The Knave: Wonderful. Then, in just a moment, I'll have you administer them.
Nanteuil: Bottled flames...?
The Knave: Indeed. They're the product of a secret experiment. Under certain special circumstances, flames can be extracted from my person and preserved.
The Knave: Once ingested, searing pain will spread across every inch of your body. No harm will come to you physically, but your memories will be burned away.
The Knave: If you can withstand the pain... When you awake, you'll have forgotten everything you know about the House of the Hearth, and will be expelled from the organization.
The Knave: In other words, administering this concoction will "kill" the version of you that grew up in the House, and give you a new identity.
Traveler: (So that means... The young man that I thought looked familiar, the one selling newspapers outside the Palais Mermonia... He must have been the same Horrer we saw on the list of executions. He wasn't killed at all...)
The Knave: Memory is a mysterious thing indeed. Losing a portion of your memories will alter your sense of self...
Traveler: (No, if my understanding of The Knave is right, she really thinks of that as "killing" him. The Horrer that lived in the House of the Hearth is dead. The one that remains is simply a normal person living out his life with his beloved.)
Traveler: (Even so, it's much better than actually ending their lives.)
Filliol: So, you're just... letting us go, "Father"?
The Knave: You misunderstand. Memories are extremely important. Once consumed by flame, the version of you standing before me will die, and our secrets will die with you. So, no, I don't intend to just "let you go," because the person who survives will be nothing but a stranger.
Filliol: Even so... Even so... *sobbing*... I won't have to live in fear anymore...
Filliol: I'm sorry, "Father." I'm sorry I let you down. But I... I really...
The Knave: Don't cry, Filliol.
The Knave: You haven't left the House yet, so there are still rules to be followed, yes? Remember what I taught you — anger makes you impulsive, sorrow causes you to waver. Don't let yourself be controlled by your emotions.
Filliol: Of course... I'll remember.
The Knave: Dry your tears and go pursue the life you really want.
Crowd: Yes, "Father"!
The Knave: Chapleau, Foltz, Heloir... Take them back to Poisson. And bring Lyney and the others as well.
The Knave: I prepared three extra vials of bottled flames. As for whether to take them, the choice is yours.
The Knave: Goodbye, children. The next time we meet, I will no longer be your "Father."
The Knave: Thank you for all you've done for the House. I hope you have bright futures ahead of you.
Filliol: "Father"...!
Chapleau: Let's go.
Foltz: Here, grab my arm, Lyney. I'll help you walk back.
Lyney: ...Thank you.
The Knave: Clervie.
Clervie: Can we talk now? I've been waiting for a super long time.
Clervie: You really are Perrie, aren't you? I haven't seen you in so long. How come you're all grown up?
Clervie: Wait, did I somehow travel to the future on accident? Or, am I dreaming? Huh, what a long dream—
The Knave: Neither... You died, Clervie. That's what happened.
Paimon: You could've at least sugarcoated it a little! Look! She's stunned speechless!
Traveler: (If this really is Clervie's younger self...)
Clervie: Oh... Okay then.
Paimon: Huh? That's it? You accepted it just like that?
Clervie: Yep. If that's what Perrie says happened, then I believe her. Perrie wouldn't lie to me.
Clervie: Plus, I don't really need to know why I'm like this. I'm more curious about what happens in the future. If you're a Harbinger now, Perrie, that means Mother is gone, isn't she?
Clervie: Can you tell me about it? I wanna know what happened to her... and to me.
The Knave: You never stopped trying to defy fate.
The Knave: At first, no one believed you. You could only vent your frustrations to the moon. In fact, you often sought comfort in the night sky. You wanted to see the aurora, so one night, we promised each other we would go to Snezhnaya to see it together.
The Knave: Later on, you tried to run away, but you were brought back each time. "Mother" spared your life, but it wasn't out of kindness. Instead, she decided to make an example of you by slowly torturing you over time. That way, the other children would know what happens to traitors.
The Knave: Still, you never gave up. "Mother" hoped that, through ruthless duel after ruthless duel, she would be able to crown an ultimate victor among the children she raised.
The Knave: But you called on everyone to unite, to fight to a draw in order to reduce casualties. Your efforts may have only delayed the inevitable, but still... you gave them hope.
The Knave: You tried everything you could think of, but every attempt ended in failure. Still, you never turned your sword on Crucabena, and you never turned it on me. On that gloomy day, you told me—
The Knave: "For the last sixteen years of my life, I've done everything I can to fight for freedom. But now, I realize that the only freedom I truly possess is the freedom to choose to die."
Clervie: I never imagined I would say something like that. I must've been feeling really worn down.
Clervie: But, somehow, I still think I understand. According to Mother's plan, only one of us was going to make it until the end... And I always hoped that person would be you.
Clervie: If I could do it all over again, I still don't think I would make a different choice. Even when I first met you, I knew you'd be able to do what I couldn't.
The Knave: Is that so? Even now, I'm not sure I truly understand what kind of freedom you were trying to pursue.
The Knave: But, as the head of the House of the Hearth and as the children's "Father," I've tried to give them the most basic of freedoms — the freedom to choose their own fate.
The Knave: It's something I discussed with the Iudex of Fontaine. The children who want to leave the House will have their memories wiped clean of all secrets pertaining to the organization. In return, they will be allowed to live a normal life in Fontaine without being prosecuted for their past.
The Knave: Of course, I won't simply hand freedom to them on a silver platter. They have to fight for it and prove themselves worthy of it. Only freedom that is earned has true value.
Clervie: That's more than enough. That's exactly the kind of life I was fighting for.
Clervie: Y'know, Perrie... I think you're a pretty amazing "king" and a really great "Father" too.
Clervie: I'm really happy that you're the one who took over the House. I guess I do have one regret, though. I still haven't seen the outside world!
The Knave: ...Well, it just so happens that our dear guests over here have been to many nations and traveled to countless places. Perhaps they would be willing to tell you what the outside world is like.
Clervie: Really?
Paimon: Of course! We've traveled all over the place! We've got so many stories, we could probably talk your ears off for three days straight!
Traveler: (Then I would say she's probably had enough lies.)

## Talk 4

Paimon: Clervie...
Paimon: She left so soon... Paimon didn't even get to finish her story...
The Knave: I also have certain sentiments left unsaid.
The Knave: I wanted to tell her that the aurora I saw in Snezhnaya was just as beautiful as the ones in the pictures.
The Knave: But, a shadow's memories reset at dawn. Had we delayed any longer, we wouldn't have had the time to say goodbye.
The Knave: Whatever regrets may linger... let them be lost to the coming of a new day.
Lyney: "Father"... *cough*
Paimon: It's Lyney! Hey, Lyney—
Paimon: What is he doing back here? Let's go check it out!
Lyney: "Father"... The bottled flames have been administered. Filliol and the others have left the House.
The Knave: And you? What have you decided?
Lyney: *ahem*... Thank you for giving us that choice, "Father." But we never wanted to leave the House. It's the only home we've ever known.
Lyney: Lynette and Freminet feel the same way. They're recuperating back at the Hotel Bouffes d'ete. But, I decided to come back and tell you where we stood.
The Knave: I'm sure you're well aware of the expectations I have for you. I want you to follow in my footsteps and become the next "king" of the House. Yet, you seem to have different ideas.
The Knave: I must admit, I'm rather surprised by your decision to stay. There's nothing wrong with choosing to live a quiet life. Leading this organization is a heavy responsibility, one not so easily carried by someone forced onto the throne.
Lyney: I just... never understood what you saw in me... what made you believe I was deserving of that throne.
The Knave: You're brave, talented... And, most importantly, you cherish your family.
The Knave: You would do anything to protect them — even if it costs you your life.
Lyney: ...
Chapleau: Speaking up back there was so brave of you, Lyney! It's all thanks to you that we were able to convince "Father" to back down.
Foltz: You're a hero, Lyney!
Lyney: (Hero... "Father" is the real hero.)
Lyney: (Had "Father" gone all out during the duel, there's no way I would've walked away with my life. She must have had it all planned from the beginning, from the very moment she suggested a duel...)
Lyney: I'm not deserving of that title. I'm not strong enough or smart enough...
The Knave: You're wrong.
The Knave: In my opinion, all you need to be deserving of the throne is conviction, and the necessary strength to act on it.
The Knave: We may have different ideas of what it means to be a family, but you can hardly be said to lack conviction. What you truly lack is strength. For someone of your talent, though, that's something that will come with time.
The Knave: Even without that strength, you still chose to face me in a duel even though the odds were stacked against you. That capacity to honor your convictions is what I truly see in you.
Lyney: "Father"...
The Knave: No one knows what the future holds, what tragedy or triumph may be in store. Being at the head of this organization requires the strength of will to face whatever comes. Caution will only hold you back.
The Knave: If reaching a certain standard were required to go after what you want, I would never have succeeded in killing my predecessor. Back then, there was still a considerable gap between our abilities.
The Knave: Strength may decide the ultimate victor, but those who let a lack of strength dictate their decisions or undermine their convictions will never be worthy of the throne.
Lyney: I understand, "Father." Thank you.
The Knave: Children must grow up to surpass their parents... Only then can a family continue to flourish.
The Knave: The road ahead is not an easy one, so I'll ask you one last time. Are you certain you want to stay?
Lyney: You've done so much for me, "Father," and that kindness must be repaid. Plus, with Project Stuzha at hand, there are many dangers ahead, and I, for one, don't intend to back down.
Lyney: ...Protecting my family at all costs — that's my conviction.
The Knave: Then you're welcome to stay. As for Project Stuzha, you need not be too concerned. If those cowardly businessmen and heartless dignitaries try to take us down, I'm prepared to teach them a lesson.
The Knave: Having members who longed for the light was our organization's last weakness. With those members no longer among our ranks, the House of the Hearth is like a spider hiding in the shadows — we need only wait for our prey to come to us.
The Knave: At present, our imperative is to use their plan to our advantage. In doing so, a crimson moon shall rise amid the frigid blizzards of winter. No demonstration of loyalty shall go unrewarded, and no sacrifice shall be in vain.
The Knave: As for the two of you, whether we meet again as friend or foe, I'll remember the camaraderie we shared in this moment.
The Knave: No matter how arduous the journey ahead, I hope we both reach our desired destination.

## Talk 5

Traveler: Talk about the land of Geo, nation of contracts.
Clervie: Ahh, that's where Mora comes from. I never knew that before.
Clervie: If I had some Mora, I would buy three new dresses. One for me, one for Perrie, and one for Mother.
Clervie: It's just too bad Perrie doesn't like wearing dresses. And Mother... Well, she probably wouldn't accept something like that, either. I guess I'd just have to keep them all for me, then! I could wear a different one every day!

## Talk 6

Traveler: Talk about land of Anemo, nation of freedom.
Clervie: Y'know, I used to dream of being a bard.
Clervie: Playing the lute while singing into the winds of freedom... Even if there was no one there to listen, I would've continued to sing no matter what.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: Talk about the land of Electro, nation of eternity.
Clervie: Those youkai you mentioned... What do they look like?
Clervie: I once saw a drawing of this one guy with horns on his head and a super scary face. Are there any youkai like that?
Paimon: Oh, sounds like you're talking about an oni. Yep, we've met one, and let Paimon tell you... They're not nearly as scary as they look.

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: Talk about the land of Dendro, nation of wisdom.
Clervie: I was always too afraid to skip Mother's fighting lessons.
Clervie: But, at the Akademiya, I bet you could do all sorts of secret things in class — things that have nothing to do with studying!
Clervie: Hehe, I'm just kidding. Being able to study whatever you want without having to fear for your life... actually sounds pretty great.

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: Talk about the land of Hydro, nation of justice.
Black Screen Text: You tell Clervie all about the various nations you've visited. Eventually, the conversation returns to Fontaine — the nation she once called home.
Paimon: The situation was super dangerous! Lyney and Lynette were accused of committing a crime, and they were going to have to stand trial at the Opera Epiclese!
Clervie: Oh no! That must have been hard for all of you. What happened next?
Paimon: Don't worry. We were able to turn the situation around super quickly. All thanks to Detective Paimon, of course.
Clervie: How'd you do that? C'mon, tell me!
Paimon: *ahem* Okay, so it was like this... After the failed magic show, we rushed to the scene, and...
Traveler: (Clervie is listening really intently to Paimon's story about our time in Fontaine. She seems really happy, like all her troubles have been forgotten.)
Traveler: (Maybe this is the first time she's ever been able to truly relax... But, I'm not sure how long this moment can last...)
The Knave: Shadows don't have the capacity to learn or grow. Any new information they encounter is quickly forgotten over time.
Traveler: (As time passes, she'll probably forget everything we've told her, and go back to being that scared little girl who could only hide in the shadows...)
Traveler: (Huh, I was so busy thinking, I almost didn't notice... The sun has risen.)

### Additional Talk 4

Paimon: Lynette, Freminet, how are you feeling?
Lynette: Much better.
Paimon: Phew, what a relief!
Lynette: What about you? Are you feeling alright?
Traveler: There's no need to worry.
Freminet: I knew you'd come out unscathed... Us, on the other hand, well... We've been bedridden for two days. I couldn't even turn over.
Freminet: Oh, and I wanted to ask... Is Clervie... gone?
Freminet: Lyney and the other members have left Poisson and returned to the House of the Hearth. According to him, there haven't been any more sightings of a spirit roaming the House.
Traveler: We bid her farewell under a blanket of sunlight.
Lynette: I see...
Freminet: I'm glad...
Freminet: "Father" came to check up on us two days ago and told us about what happened with Crucabena and Clervie. Actually, I... I've met Crucabena before.
Paimon: Wait, what? You've met the former Knave?
Freminet: Crucabena died a year after Clervie. It was during the year between their deaths that I joined the House of the Hearth.
Freminet: Crucabena had an extremely cruel and radical way of doing things. While she was alive, the atmosphere in the House was suffocating.
Freminet: When I joined, though, the experiments she valued so much had already come to an end, and all the people involved — dead and injured alike — were gone. Crucabena never talked about the past with us newcomers.
Freminet: A couple months after I joined, "Father" killed Crucabena and burned all her files. With that, the names of all the people subjected to her experiments — Clervie included — were lost to the flames, along with the painful memories they represented.
Lynette: "Father" took in Lyney and me a couple months after that, but she never mentioned anything about Crucabena or Clervie.
Paimon: Hmm, it really seems like something she was planning to keep to herself.
Paimon: The last time you talked to her, did she mention why she kept it a secret for so long?
Lynette: She said she didn't want us to be affected by the darkness of the past. She was worried we'd develop a false sense of gratitude towards her if we knew about it.
Lynette: "The foundation of a family should be free of any corrupting influence. Whatever happened in the past, it has nothing to do with who we are now."
Lynette: ...That's what "Father" told us in the end.
Freminet: But, I still thanked her for everything. It was only after hearing about what Crucabena did that I finally realized how insignificant our lives could have been... The members of the House meant nothing to her. To say that she valued them in any way, even just as a tool, would probably be giving her too much credit.
Freminet: If "Father" hadn't taken over the House of the Hearth, I probably would've already...
Traveler: Don't think about that.
Lynette: "Father" rarely brings up the fact that she saved us. She doesn't believe that being indebted to her should be what ties us together.
Lynette: But, even if we didn't owe her anything, we would still choose to stay. Because this is our home.
Lynette: We may have arguments or times when we feel wronged. Some people may even choose to leave. But, as long as "Father" is here, we will always have a home.
Freminet: Whether the path before us is bathed in sunlight or shrouded in shadow, we'll follow "Father" wherever she chooses to go.
Freminet: So, I wanted to say thank you for helping us make it through this crisis. Without your help, we could've lost a lot more along the way.
Paimon: Oh, we didn't do anything, really.
Traveler: Just invite us back as guests and we'll call it even!
Freminet: Of course! You're welcome any time.
Paimon: Are... Filliol and Nanteuil okay?
Lynette: I actually saw them at a cafe this morning.
Lynette: They didn't recognize me. From what I could tell, they were drinking coffee and talking about one of the operas that started running recently.
Lynette: They seemed happy. If I had to take a guess, I would say they finally found the kind of life they always wished for.
Traveler: She saved you in the end.
Traveler: Her wish has been fulfilled.
Traveler: I'm right as rain!
