Traveler: What's with the long face?
Jones: I'm regretting getting duped into coming to Inazuma.
Jones: I was making a living by doing some menial labor at Dornman Port before this. And then I ran into people from the Kanjou Commission who were recruiting sailors.
Jones: Their supervisor told me that it wouldn't be a tiring gig and that it paid well. I could even travel to Inazuma!
Jones: Because of the lockdown now, regular people can't come to Inazuma at all. Only cargo ships affiliated with the Kanjou Commission may pass through.
Jones: I figured that it might be a good job since I could visit the outside world and make some money. That's why I boarded the ship with them.
Jones: Who knew that I would not even have a chance to walk around freely once I got here...
Jones: This job is hard and tiring, and I can't even return to Mondstadt if I don't finish the job here! What kind of crap is this?
