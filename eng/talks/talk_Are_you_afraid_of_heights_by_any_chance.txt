Traveler: Are you afraid of heights, by any chance?
Koyama: Um, heh, so you realized...
Koyama: I'm a Sangonomiya soldier, and in the past, my work always had to do with normal patrols and other duties, so I was fine.
Koyama: But as we started dispatching more troops out, I ended up having to guard this road to Sangonomiya Shrine.
Koyama: I couldn't muster up the courage to say that I was afraid of heights, so I just came here anyway. I thought I could take it...
Koyama: But when I got here... I mean, just look at that! It's so high up! I... I can't even take a step further, never mind guard this place!
Koyama: Oh, if only work was as simple as before... I just had to tail outsiders and stuff, you know?
