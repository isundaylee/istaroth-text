Traveler: What are you doing?
Sharp: Master Goth pays me to protect his young esquire. His young esquire pays me to keep this a secret from his old man.
Sharp: To get paid double, I just have to stay put and keep my mouth shut.
Sharp: Hmph, look at them. Being all lovey-dovey when I'm right here watching. Young people these days, no sense of shame...
Sharp: Wait a second... Are they getting a kick out of me watching them!?
Sharp: ...Ugh, I cannot abide this!
