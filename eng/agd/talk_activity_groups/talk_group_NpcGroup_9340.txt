Thoma: #Thanks for inviting me here, Traveler!
Thoma: If there's nothing too urgent that needs your attention, why not take a seat and relax for a bit? I'll make you some tea.
Thoma: Oh, don't mention it, it's nothing, really! I'd hate to see anyone who needs my care tiring themselves out too much.

## Talk

Thoma: Even if spearmanship isn't my strong suit, I'll do my best to protect you in this battle!

## Talk

Thoma: When I was little, my mother often read me bedtime stories. Back then, I thought the world was just like in those stories, and everyone led peaceful, happy lives.
Thoma: It was only later that I realized the difficulties and struggles many people face in society. All I can do is try my best, and stay loyal to the people I care about.
Thoma: Now that I think about it, even though the stories are fictional, they can still help children get a good night's sleep. To me, that's enough.
