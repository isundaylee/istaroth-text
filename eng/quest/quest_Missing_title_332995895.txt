Traveler: I'm sure Sudabeh will grow up to be a great distinguished lady!
Sudabeh: #Thanks, Traveler! I'm learning really hard! To become a distinguished lady sooner, I'm learning how to cook!

Sudabeh: They told me not to cook this too often because it's worth being cherished since it's too delicious, but I will surely keep cooking it!
