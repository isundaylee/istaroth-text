# "Fashion Show"

Chiori's specialty. At the ministrations of her nimble fingers, even the common taiyaki is transformed, garbed in glorious fillings that serenade the senses, regaling your taste buds and eyes with such a grand feast that it threatens to overwhelm them. It would be no overstatement to call this a masterpiece of culinary artistry.
