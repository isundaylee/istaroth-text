Traveler: So, you mentioned your brother...
Ogura Mio: I have a samurai brother who is stationed afar and cannot return home yet.
Ogura Mio: Ever since my father's passing, the store that my brother should have been taking care of was left to me instead.
Ogura Mio: Although we cannot meet, we still keep writing to each other. I'm glad that we're aware of each other's well-being.
