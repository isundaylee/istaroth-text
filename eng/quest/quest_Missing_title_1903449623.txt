# Missing title (1903449623)

Traveler: I've got some treasure I want to sell.
Linlang: Oh, what rare objects have you found this time? Let me have a look.
Black Screen Text: You tell Linlang about the Dragonbone Orb.
Linlang: If what you see is true, this is a truly amazing relic.
Linlang: But from a cursory examination, I can't find anything evidently special about it. Perhaps it requires extensive use to show its qualities...
Linlang: The way I see it, it does seem that the wondrous properties you ascribe to it might be a tad... exaggerated. Perhaps it was simply something entrusted to you by those who had failed in their task.
Linlang: Don't take it to heart, though. I'm just saying what's coming to my mind.
Linlang: This is quite the common occurrence in our line of work, anyway.
Linlang: Also, I believe that you did not keep this in sealed storage — it does seem like there is some wear and tear on its surface already.
Linlang: I'm afraid that there will be some price reduction on that front, too.
Linlang: How does 80,000 Mora sound? I can add 5 Bountiful Years on as specialty dishes as well.
Linlang: I believe that this is a good price.
Traveler: ...What will you use it for?
Linlang: To be honest, I would consider the story behind it more valuable than its capabilities.
Linlang: I suspect that this might be of much interest to our storytellers and opera troupes, or perhaps the great men and women of Yujing Terrace.
Linlang: It would be quite the ancient showpiece of a relic even if I were to simply mount it on our shop counter.
Traveler: A fair price. Done.
Linlang: My, that's quite forward of you. Well then, here's you Mora.
Linlang: If you should find any other such treasures, we are always awaiting your patronage.
Traveler: Let me think about it a bit more.
Linlang: No problem. After all, you should always check the goods — I mean, the prices — when you're planning to sell precious relics.
Linlang: You can come to me again once you've mulled the matter over.

Traveler: About the Dragonbone Orb...

Linlang: Thank you for your patronage. Here's your Mora.
Linlang: If you should find any other such treasures, we are always awaiting your patronage.
Traveler: Let me think about it one more time.
