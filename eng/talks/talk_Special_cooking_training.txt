Traveler: Special cooking training?
Arapacati: Yes, Arachatora, Arasaka, Arapas and Araphala remember "the taste of happiness" of Nara. Very special, more special than any smell in the forest.
Arapacati: #So they want "special cooking training." We'll share "the taste of happiness," when Nara {NICKNAME} comes back.
Arapacati: Hope they don't be so silly this time.
