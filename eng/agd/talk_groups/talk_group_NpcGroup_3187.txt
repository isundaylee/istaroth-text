Traveler: How have things been?
Anisa: Haha, good, good! Thanks for your concern!
Anisa: The weather here's good, the environment's pretty nice, and the food's just the best. Also, thanks to Little Kumi's care, I've had all the time and energy in the world to focus on my research!
Anisa: It's just that... I guess I worry her a bit when I go running around.
Anisa: Hehehe, I actually do feel a bit bad about it.

Traveler: It's good to see you again.
Anisa: Same here! It's always good to meet the person who saved my career in oceanography, you know?
Anisa: Ah yes, speaking of that, I've been studying the various fish species in the waters around Watatsumi Island to try to pin down the areas in which Kuntira's descendants might be living.
Anisa: And in the process, I discovered the great amount of diversity that exists among the oceanic creatures here! An unexpected boon indeed!
Anisa: *cough* Sorry, I got a little carried away. Regardless, thank you so much for your help.

Traveler: How's Kumi doing?
Anisa: Thanks to you, she's cheered up a lot.
Anisa: That said, she's taken all these tasks onto herself... Watching her run around like that makes me wish I could help her out a bit...
Anisa: Ah yes, speaking of that... I've learned how to make some local dishes from Little Kumi in the meantime, and I've also added a little spin on them from my hometown.
Anisa: Hehe, I'm sure you'd like it!
Anisa: Wanna try some when you get the chance next time?
