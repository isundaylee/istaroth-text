# International Travel Log


## Talk 1

Midori: Well, I'm running out of new stories to tell Kouichi...
Traveler: What kind of new story?
Midori: It's a new story told by Uncle Ramsay.
Midori: He said he's been to many countries and seen many interesting things. In order to record these things, he wrote something called the travelogue.
Midori: He showed me a lot of his travelogues!
Midori: For example, there's a kind of iron carriage that flies in the sky in Fontaine. It runs along an invisible road. It takes no time to travel from one end of the village to the other.
Midori: There's a special kind of grass in Sumeru, which can be planted anywhere. It can be planted in soil, water, or sand. Once it's planted, it will sprout and grow.
Midori: And... And... There's a kind of... hmmm... boat that can stay at the bottom of the sea for a long time!
Midori: By riding in that boat, people can go to the deep sea to do all kinds of things and see all kinds of fish!
Traveler: Really...
Midori: Anyway, that's what Uncle Ramsay told me...
Midori: Well, that's not the point!
Midori: Recently, Uncle Ramsay stopped sending me his travelogue for some reason. So I'm running out of stories to tell Kouichi.
Midori: I know that Uncle Ramsay has been staying at the Komore Teahouse. I wanted to go find him. But the gatekeeper, Sister Kozue, wouldn't let me in because I'm a kid...
Midori: You look old enough. Can you help me ask Uncle Ramsay, what happened to those travelogues?
Traveler: Ehm, I am not that old...
Midori: Anyway! You look like a reliable person. Please help me!
Traveler: I'll see.
Midori: Oh? Are you also interested in reading those travelogues? No problem. Just give them to me when you're finished.
Midori: I... I'll go with you. Although I can't get in, I can wait for you near the teahouse...
Midori: Ah, I'm so looking forward to reading Uncle Ramsay's new travelogue.
Traveler: Did he tell you about Snezhnaya?
Midori: Snezhnaya? Well, I don't think so.

## Talk 2

Ramsay: The last location is the top of the hill over there.
Ramsay: The view there is very good. We should be able to get a panoramic view of the surrounding landscape.

## Talk 3

Ramsay: Are you... a traveler? What can I do for you?
Traveler: About the travelogue...
Ramsay: Oh, you mean the travelogue I wrote for that little girl Midori.
Ramsay: I've been too busy to write those lately. She must be getting anxious...
Traveler: Are those travelogues real?
Ramsay: Hahaha, what do you think?
Traveler: They don't sound real to me...
Ramsay: Hahaha, I can see you are well-traveled. You can tell right away.
Ramsay: That's right. Technically, none of the facts in the travelogues are real.
Ramsay: Although some places and characters are based on reality... Most of the contents are my own imagination.
Ramsay: Of course, some of it is not entirely imaginary. For example, in the travelogue that I'm writing, someone made a super balloon.
Ramsay: Then he summoned his friends and planned to travel around Teyvat in this balloon in 80 days.
Ramsay: Also, this balloon does not require a Vision to operate. All it takes is some technical knowledge.
Ramsay: These people travel around the world in the balloon, and they encounter various strange things and phenomena along the way...
Ramsay: I was going to write this for Midori. But for some reason, I didn't even have time to finish a short paragraph.
Traveler: Why is that?
Ramsay: Do you see that guy in the hallway? He's called Heihachi. He's been staring at me since I don't know when.
Ramsay: I was going out to look for inspiration for my travelogue. But that guy has been following me everywhere. I don't know what he's trying to do.
Ramsay: I'm worried that this guy has ill intentions towards me. I wouldn't dare to go out. That's why the travelogue has been delayed.
Ramsay: Fortunately, now you are here. Traveler, can you accompany me to look for inspiration outside? With you here, I don't think he would dare to do anything to me.
Traveler: I'll take care of it.
Ramsay: Thank you.
Ramsay: As the saying goes, "one must guard against others." Someone's staring at me from behind. I have to guard against him no matter what.
Ramsay: So when I'm looking for inspiration, please protect me, traveler.
Ramsay: In fact, I already have a few locations in mind. Let's go there right now.
Ramsay: The first place is near the beach. Let's go.
Traveler: Why would he do that?
Ramsay: I don't know. But... People don't need a reason to be malicious to someone.
Traveler: I hope it's true.
Ramsay: Hahaha, I also wish the things I wrote could come true.

## Talk 4

Ramsay: The water at this beach is crystal clear, and the color of the sand is so white, it's completely different from the open seas.
Ramsay: It would be a nice place to set sail from... or take off from...
Ramsay: Ehm, the scenery here is very nice. Let me write it down in my notes.
Ramsay: Traveler, please wait a moment. I need to think about how to write my travelogue. You can walk around and enjoy the scenery.
Ramsay: But please don't stray too far away from me. The guy Heihachi is following me. He's just nearby.

## Talk 5

Ramsay: The water at this beach is crystal clear, and the color of the sand is so white, it's completely different from the open seas.
Ramsay: This could be a safe place to set sail from...

## Talk 6

Heihachi: Why are you standing in my way? Are you trying to start something?
Traveler: Why are you following us?
Heihachi: Following you? What? I'm just taking a walk around here! What's wrong with that? Do you own this beach? Who do you think you are...

## Talk 7

Ramsay: Pretty good! The scenery here is really nice...
Ramsay: And then... Let me have a look. There is a river bend in the outskirts to the north of town. The small waterfall there is very nice. Let's go there.

## Talk 8

Ramsay: Please take these paragraphs of travelogue to Midori. When I finish the whole story, I'll ask someone to bring her the completed travelogue.
Heihachi: Humph, there must be some sort of agenda behind it... Just that he hasn't exposed himself yet.

## Talk 9

Ramsay: Why are there monsters wandering around... Although the scenery is very nice, it really is quite dangerous...
Ramsay: But I can include this experience in my travelogue...
Ramsay: Let's get out of here and find a safe place.
Ramsay: That guy is still following us. He's really... humph... persistent...

## Talk 10

Heihachi: What the hell is this place? There are monsters here...
Traveler: Why are you following us?
Heihachi: Me... follow you? Aren't I allowed to come here to enjoy a walk and pick fruit? So paranoid...

## Talk 11

Ramsay: Standing on the top of the mountain, you can almost see the entire Narukami Island.
Ramsay: The wind at the mountain top is quite strong, and the height is perfect for take-off. There are no obstacles here.
Ramsay: And it's a long way from Inazuma City, I won't be disturbed by Doushin... or by unwanted people.
Traveler: It really is a good location.
Ramsay: In conclusion, it's a good location to take off from... And it's a nice place to write about in the travelogue.
Ramsay: That guy... he's still following us. He just won't let us go.
Traveler: I'll get rid of him.
Ramsay: It's fine. Don't worry about him. He wouldn't dare do anything rash with you around.
Ramsay: When dealing with this kind of person... If you approach him, he would keep pestering you.
Ramsay: Anyway, let's call it a day. Let's go back to the Komore Teahouse.

## Talk 12

Ramsay: I already have some ideas about the main story of my travelogue. But it'll take me a day or two to finish the chapter.
Ramsay: I wrote a few paragraphs before. Please take these paragraphs to Midori first.
Ramsay: When I am finished with the whole story, I'll ask someone to bring her the completed travelogue.
Heihachi: Travelogue... Humph. That's what he says. How would I know if he has any other agendas...
Traveler: What are you talking about?
Heihachi: I said this guy has ulterior motives for writing these travelogues.
Heihachi: Who would think about such random nonsense? Traveling around Teyvat in a hot-air balloon without using a Vision...
Heihachi: Humph, there must be some sort of agenda behind it... he just hasn't exposed himself yet.

## Talk 13

Midori: Traveler, did you get the Travelogue?
Traveler: This is from Mr. Ramsay...
Midori: Travel around Teyvat in Eighty Days... WOW! Thank you! Let me have a look...
Midori: Oh, how come this is so thin? The other travelogues are much thicker...
Traveler: He hasn't finished yet.
Midori: Is that so? I'll wait and read it when Uncle Ramsay is finished... Then I'll have a new story to tell Kouichi.
Midori: Thank you, Traveler. These are for you. Please accept them.
