Traveler: Your little brother...
Arya: Yeah, I have a young brother. He should be out playing with his friends at the moment.
Arya: He has taken a great interest in Sumpter Beasts recently for some reason.
Arya: His friend's family seems to have Sumpter Beasts at home, and he goes there at every opportunity.
Arya: Every time a merchant delivered something to our house, he would fix his eyes on the Sumpter Beast carrying the goods.
Arya: Well... I suppose it's not bad for him to learn about merchants' job in his early age. When he grows up, he can help with the family business.
