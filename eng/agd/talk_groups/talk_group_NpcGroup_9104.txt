## Talk

Chasca: So this is your hideout, huh? Nice place.
Chasca: It would be even better if there were some elevated areas for defensive purposes... But, I'm guessing you don't have to worry about break-ins.

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Chasca: Well... It'll certainly take some getting used to.
Chasca: This place is so peaceful, it's almost uncanny. No howling wind, ferocious beasts, crashing waves, bustling crowds... None of that.
Chasca: And that constant sense of restlessness inside me... It finally feels calm. It's so... strange.
Traveler: Fancy a spar?
Chasca: No thanks. I don't want to disturb the peace. It's not an easy feeling to come by.
Chasca: There's already more than enough conflict and discord in the world. This is a nice escape.
Chasca: Thank you for bringing me here.
Traveler: Strange in a bad way?
Chasca: No, not at all. It's a nice change of pace.

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Chasca: Sure! There was something I wanted to ask you, actually.
Traveler: Oh, really? What is it?
Chasca: That's Tubby over there, right? Do you know how she stays aloft like that?
Chasca: She looks so... well, for lack of a better word, tubby... Yet she somehow manages to keep floating there, without any kind of power source, as far as I can tell...
Chasca: If I can figure out how she pulls that off, maybe I can carry even more firepower into the sky.
Traveler: I'm guessing it's some kind of adeptal art from Liyue...
Chasca: "Adeptal art"? I've heard of those before, but it sounded so... incredible. It's a shame the adepti are said to be so elusive, at least if the stories are anything to go by.
Traveler: Why don't you ask Tubby herself?
Chasca: Well, I already tried asking her about it.
Chasca: ...But she seemed a bit on edge. She said my expression looked like an eagle stalking its prey...
Traveler: Or a Qucusaur, more like...
Chasca: You think so? Hmm... Qucusaurs are similar to birds of prey in many ways.
Traveler: Such as the look in their eyes?
Chasca: Yeah, actually. Qucusaurs have prominent brow ridges and forward-facing eyes, just like many birds of prey. This helps them protect their eyes during high-speed maneuvers and allows them to lock onto targets from high altitudes.
Chasca: At first glance, they do look pretty scary.
Traveler: No wonder Tubby was scared...
Chasca: *ahem* Well, I'd never treat Tubby as prey... Plus, I'm not actually a Qucusaur.
Chasca: I should find an opportunity to clear up this misunderstanding. Although, since I'm one of the parties involved, I probably can't be the peacemaker this time...
Traveler: Why don't you offer her some feather-care products?
Chasca: Hmm... That's a good idea. Qucusaurs spend a lot of time taking care of their feathers every day.
Chasca: I've developed a few feather-care sprays myself, actually. They keep feathers bright, repel insects, and eliminate odors... Maybe Tubby would find them helpful.
Traveler: How about some shiny accessories?
Chasca: Oh, you really seem to know your stuff. My "mom" and I love collecting little ornaments like that. I wonder if Tubby likes shiny things too.
Chasca: Hmm... judging by the look of the Realm Currency, I'm guessing the answer is yes.
Traveler: Such as their diets?
Chasca: Yeah. Qucusaurs are carnivores too, much like birds of prey. Their hooked beaks and razor-sharp talons aid them in hunting.
Chasca: In addition to all the usual small and medium-sized mammals and fish, they occasionally attack smaller birds too...

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Chasca: I'd like to scout out the terrain from high up in the air to see if there are any weak spots in our defenses.
Traveler: This place is pretty safe, you know...
Chasca: I was only kidding. I just wanted to get a better look at what you've created.
Chasca: I'm used to flying so fast that I have to focus all my energy on distant targets or enemies on the ground. I rarely get a chance to stop and admire the scenery itself.
Chasca: But I guess I'll get that chance here.
Traveler: Sounds like an interesting trip.
Chasca: Well, "it's about the journey, not the destination"... Isn't that what people say?
Traveler: So, the scenery on this journey...
Chasca: Well, it goes without saying that you wouldn't normally see things from such a high angle.
Chasca: Buildings that you're used to seeing up close suddenly look like tiny little boxes, and mountain peaks that you normally see from far below seem an arm's length away...
Chasca: ...Gazing down from up high is an incredible feeling, almost like the vastness of the world has been compressed into the space of a single painting.
Traveler: Want me to draw you something to stare at?
Chasca: Oh, you mean like... a massive mural that can only be seen from the sky? Ha, that actually sounds pretty fun.
Chasca: There are plenty of cliffside murals near the Flower-Feather Clan, but not many flat, open areas large enough for a giant work of land art.
Chasca: What are you planning to draw? Any ideas?
Chasca: Actually... How about I lend you a hand? It'll go a lot quicker with someone who can fly up and check the progress, don't you think?
Traveler: Is there anything different about it?

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Chasca.
Chasca: Morning. Any plans for today?

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Chasca.
Chasca: Good night. Get some rest, okay? You need to be ready for whatever tomorrow brings.

Chasca: Ah, this looks like the Flower-Feather Clan... I remember when I first arrived, I didn't think much of it at all.
Chasca: My daily routine was pretty much break a few hot air balloons or tear down a stage, then run away before I got caught...
Chasca: But somehow... I guess somewhere along the line, I've grown pretty fond of sights like this.

## Talk

Chasca: Huh... is that a conference table? It's such a reassuring presence. Once both sides of an argument are willing to sit down and talk, there's a good chance things will finally move forward.
Chasca: It can take a lot of work just to get to that stage. Some people are so stubborn, you pretty much have to drag them kicking and screaming to the negotiation table.
Chasca: So although this is where people formally reach an agreement, most of the groundwork is usually laid away from the table.
