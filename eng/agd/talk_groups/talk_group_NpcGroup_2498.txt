## Talk

Hautemontagne: Oh, I'm enjoying this life, let me tell you...

## Talk

Traveler: This is an order from the Fontaine Research Institute, Hautemontagne!
Hautemontagne: Bah! *coughs* What are you doing? Why did you scare me like that?
Hautemontagne: I just wasted a good cup of tea... You had me thinking that they needed people so badly that they've come to kidnap me!

## Talk

Traveler: When are you planning on returning to the Institute?
Hautemontagne: Returning? Well... When the repairs are done, of course. The Three-Phase Asynchronous Elemental Tuner is not something that can be fixed in a day.
Hautemontagne: I also have to design a comprehensive maintenance plan for the folks here. It requires taking the environment, the people, changes in the geography, and available materials into consideration.
Hautemontagne: Everything needs time, so I won't be back anytime soon. What a shame... I do sometimes miss the free chips and Fonta at the Institute, you know...

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Hautemontagne: Sorry about not seeing you off, but I've got a show to be at later.

## Talk

Traveler: Feeling guilty, aren't you?
Hautemontagne: Guilty? Nonsense. I'm here on official business! Look, they sent someone to the Institute because they needed someone to repair something. The Institute couldn't find anyone, and when they noticed I was twiddling my thumbs in Lumidouce Harbor, they ultimately decided to send me...
Hautemontagne: Right, I know what you're going to ask next. I was working on applying the Multi-Phase Tuner to hydrology, so I'm more on the application side.
Hautemontagne: My head hurts just looking at the theoretical discussions. We don't get a lot of opportunities to be in the spotlight, but I'm satisfied just looking at my results being implemented and in operation.
Hautemontagne: Oops, I accidentally said things that I shouldn't have. Please don't take what I said seriously.

Hautemontagne: I'm really enjoying this life...

## Talk

Traveler: This is an order from Choiseul, Hautemontagne!
Hautemontagne: *coughs* *coughing fit*
Hautemontagne: What are you doing, using his name? Don't scare me like that! I'm on the application side, so only Raimondo can fire me!
Hautemontagne: You got me good there. For a moment, I thought they needed people so badly that they'd sent someone to come kidnap me!

Traveler: When are you planning on returning to the Institute?
Hautemontagne: Returning? Well... When the repairs are done, of course. The Three-Phase Asynchronous Elemental Tuner is not something that can be fixed in a day.
Hautemontagne: I also have to design a comprehensive maintenance plan for the folks here. It requires taking the environment, the people, changes in the geography, and available materials into consideration.
Hautemontagne: See, all this takes time, so I won't be able to go back for quite a while.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Hautemontagne: Wait! Wait! I'm begging you, Honorary Senior Researcher. Please don't rat me out back at the institute! Please!
