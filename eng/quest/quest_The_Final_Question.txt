# The Final Question


## Talk 1

Paimon: Wh—What's going on? We seem to be in a different place now... But where is this?
Seymour: Searching... No data concerning this place has been found in my memory banks.
Paimon: So you haven't been here before either, then?
Seymour: #Affirmative. There is no need to worry, Mr. Traveler, Ms. Paimon.
Seymour: I am equipped with the most advanced optics from the Fontaine Institute of Natural Philosophy. I simply need to record this information in my storage units and compare it with previous data...
Seymour: The odds of this being the Narzissenkreuz Ordo are high.
Paimon: High... Guess this must be the place we're looking for, then!

## Talk 2

Paimon: So this is the Narzissenkreuz Ordo!
Seymour: Recording... This location and data regarding it have been recorded in my storage unit.
Paimon: We've been here before... The Mary-Ann you're looking for probably isn't here...
Paimon: But we might still find some clues that we didn't before.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Did you remember anything useful upon arriving here, Seymour?
Seymour: Negative. The newly-recorded information is pending further analysis and organization. No effective conclusion possible at present.
Paimon: Huh? Then, uh, are we gonna have to wait for a long time until...
Seymour: Affirmative. Record space collation starting. Total time required, unknown. Interactive functions will cease temporarily while this is ongoing.
Paimon: Wait! Hold on a second first!
Seymour: #Roger. Interrupting space collation process. What instructions, Mr. Traveler, Ms. Paimon?
Paimon: Come to think of it, we don't know a lot about you either, Seymour.
Paimon: All we know is that your master isn't Mamere, but is someone named Mary-Ann.
Seymour: Affirmative. Ms. Mary-Ann is my master. According to my standard deduction module, the odds of finding clues as to her whereabouts here are high.
Paimon: We know, you said that before too. But it felt like there were some more basic questions we hadn't answered yet... Now seems like a good time, right?
Paimon: If you could tell us a bit more about yourself and Mary-Ann, we might be able to better help you.
Seymour: Of course, kind Miss.
Paimon: #So, Traveler, what would you like to ask?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: Any other questions?

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: Tell us about yourself, Seymour...
Seymour: I am Prototype 4ACV07, designed by *garbled mechanical noises* to accompany and protect my master, Ms. Mary-Ann.
Paimon: Uh, Paimon didn't get a word of that.
Seymour: ...*garbled mechanical noises* is my creator.
Seymour: I am equipped with the most advanced optics, memory storage unit, logic unit, and various functional modules from the Fontaine Institute of Natural Philosophy.
Paimon: Uhh... That was clear as mud, but it sure sounds impressive...?
Traveler: The more impressive the equipment, the harder it might be to fix once broken...
Seymour: Note: Regular record space collation can decrease the frequency of such issues effectively.
Paimon: So, basically... before you've done your collation thing, there's some stuff that you can't tell us even if you knew, right?
Seymour: Affirmative. More precisely, *garbled mechanical noises* grasped *garbled mechanical noises*.
Seymour: Information regarding *garbled mechanical noises* can be extracted using *garbled mechanical noises*.
Seymour: This allows me to keep a log of Ms. Mary-Ann's daily life and also act as an agent's assistant.
Paimon: Are you serious? The important bits all got cut off!
Traveler: What's an agent's assistant?
Seymour: An "agent" refers to a member of the Marechaussee Phantom who undertakes investigations. In this context, "assistant" refers to "Seymour," prototype 4ACV07 itself.
Traveler: So, Mary-Ann was a Marechaussee Phantom agent?
Seymour: Affirmative.
Paimon: Wait. If that's who she is, wouldn't looking for official records help us find her faster? Why'd we need to come here?
Seymour: Ms. Mary-Ann's role as an agent was not publicized. Additionally, the case she investigated has to do with *garbled mechanical noises*.
Seymour: It is *garbled mechanical noises* performed at the direction of *garbled mechanical noises*. As such... *garbled mechanical noises*.
Paimon: Ugh, Seymour, you're breaking down again, aren't you?
Seymour: Note: Regular record space collation can decrease the frequency of such issues effectively.
Paimon: Let's... just ask a different question, shall we...

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: Tell me about the Narzissenkreuz Ordo...
Paimon: Can we really find clues about Mary-Ann's whereabouts here? You've never been here before, right? So why do you think we'll find clues here?
Seymour: My latest records indicate that the last records before meeting Ms. Mamere were those of myself executing a specific process.
Seymour: This process was the capture of fugitive elements from the Narzissenkreuz Ordo. Ms. Mary-Ann was also executing this process.
Seymour: As her companion and guard, I followed her and *garbled mechanical noises* into Elynas.
Seymour: There, we encountered members of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, including Jakob Ingold, a core member of said Ordo.
Paimon: So he was a member? And Mary-Ann was pursuing him...
Seymour: Affirmative.
Paimon: Well, guess there really was some relation there, then... Gah! We should've captured Jakob and questioned him.
Paimon: Paimon wonders if he'll come back here — if we ever meet again, we're gonna have questions for him.
Traveler: He doesn't seem like the sort who'll simply answer questions if asked.
Paimon: If all else fails, we can just... y'know, go good-cop bad-cop on him! There's gotta be some way, or else we're stuck waiting for Seymour to recall stuff.
Seymour: You mean, when I complete my record space collation, Ms. Paimon.
Paimon: Those things are basically the same!

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: Tell me about your latest records...
Seymour: A fierce battle against the members of the Ordo broke out within Elynas. My storage unit encountered an error due to massive trauma.
Seymour: We must foil the Ordo's plans. To that end, Jakob Ingold, *garbled mechanical noises* ... *garbled mechanical noises* must be stopped.
Seymour: Due to *garbled mechanical noises* ... *garbled mechanical noises* ... *garbled mechanical noises* ... to Ms. Mary-Ann.
Traveler: You'd best take a break.
Seymour: Your words are most considerate.
Paimon: Seems like we're gonna have to wait for you to do that collation thing, Seymour...
Paimon: But whatever the case, Jakob was trying to do something bad inside Elynas, while you and Mary-Ann were trying to stop him, right?
Seymour: Affirmative. Your summary is overly simplistic, perhaps, but it is basically the truth, Ms. Paimon.

### Additional Talk 5

Paimon: If we only have this information...
Traveler: Finding Mary-Ann might be somewhat difficult.
Paimon: Doesn't seem like we've got other options beyond waiting for you to do that record collation of yours, Seymour.
Seymour: Affirmative. My calculations indicate that this is the approach with the highest success rate.
Traveler: But it'll take a lot of time, won't it?
Seymour: If you wish, I can estimate the amount of time required. Processing time required... unknown.
Paimon: Uh, yeah, no need for this estimation stuff, then!
Paimon: #Well, Paimon's done asking Seymour questions now. But boy has she still got some for you, Traveler! You promised you'd explain, didn't you?
Traveler: I didn't stash any snacks away without your knowledge.
Paimon: That's not what Paimon's asking!
Paimon: But there's no one to disturb us now, and Seymour's... Well, a related party, right? No time like the present, then!
Black Screen Text: You tell Paimon and Seymour about the conversation you had previously with Elynas...
Paimon: Huh, so that's a thing that happened. Paimon thought you'd gotten sick or something when you started saying all that weird stuff!
Paimon: Well, it's good to know that you're fine!
Paimon: By the way, Seymour, leaving you here to perform your record collation wouldn't be a problem, would it?
Traveler: There wasn't a good time to have this conversation earlier...

### Additional Talk 6

Seymour: Affirmative. I do not detect any possible source of danger.
Paimon: Well, then you can just stay here for now, right?
Seymour: A wise choice. The two of you should use your limited time more effectively.
Seymour: Patience is a virtue in some situations, but meaningless waiting is merely a waste of time.
Traveler: We'll come back to see you.
Paimon: Yeah, Mamere's gonna be super worried about you, too. You've gotta go back to her in one piece, after all!

### Additional Talk 7

Caterpillar: A new friend... oh? Actually, looks like an old friend.
Seymour: Negative. Danger. Danger. Activity by Narzissenkreuz Ordo remnants detected.
Caterpillar: We meet again. What did the White Cavalier of Protection say about you? Ah, yes. "This is my little invention."
Seymour: Affirmative. I am... *garbled mechnical noises* prototype, with a large number of bold design elements.
Seymour: ...The priority level of this topic has been downgraded. Please lay down your arms and surrender.
Caterpillar: #Seymour, listen to me. I've already surrendered to Traveler.
Seymour: Is that so?
Traveler: Yes, totally.
Seymour: Very well. In that case, we can continue to discuss my extraordinary design.
Caterpillar: I am Caterpillar, as you know. Speaking of which, how's the young lady you were protecting doing?
Caterpillar: ...Wait a moment. Why did I say something like that?
Paimon: What's wrong?
Seymour: You are correct. I am looking for the master I should protect, Ma—
Caterpillar: Mary-Ann. Or, as you might call her, Mary-Ann Guillotin.
Traveler: ...Mary-Ann Guillotin!
Seymour: ... *mechanical noises* ...*the mechnical noises slowly become clearer* Guillotin.
Seymour: Correct. My designer. Guillotin.
Paimon: Caterpillar, is this your memories from hundreds of years ago, y'know, getting clearer?
Caterpillar: No. This is a memory from before my birth, something akin to an elephant recalling its previous life while meditating.
Seymour: I do not understand. Previous lives do not exist.
Caterpillar: Not for you, at least.
Caterpillar: Thanks to you, it seems that I've encountered a potential breakthrough I had never imagined possible. Perhaps I might find the secrets to my own birth after all.
Seymour: Though I do not understand, I am glad to have been of service.
Paimon: In that case, why don't we exchange information?
Paimon: Since Seymour's here, maybe you'll be able to find some special records or something, Caterpillar.
Seymour: I do not understand, but I determine the likelihood of success to be high.
Black Screen Text: You share the information...
Caterpillar: So, Jakob has emerged...
Caterpillar: I have another hypothesis about all this, but to prove my conjecture, I still need to conduct some onsite investigations. If you could accompany us, Seymour, that would help a lot.
Seymour: This is a decision that will help restore my records. I will accompany you.
Caterpillar: #Very good. In that case... Traveler, Paimon, once I am 90% confident, I will inform you.
Paimon: Great!

### Additional Talk 8

Ann: *yawn*~
Paimon: Huh? Ann, you're awake!
Ann: #Oh... Good morning, Paimon, Knight Traveler.
Paimon: Ooh, yes, let Paimon introduce you. This is Ann, an Oceanid and a friend of ours. Ann, this is...
Ann: ...I know. You're the silly dog, Seymour.
Paimon: Huh?
Seymour: I lack the relevant data. I do not believe we have had the honor of meeting, Oceanid Ann.
Ann: I've never met you before, either. But I was sure of it the moment I saw you — you must be Seymour.
Paimon: Uh, what's going on here?
Ann: This must be... No, I don't know, either. I feel... strange...
Seymour: Note: Regular record space collation can decrease the frequency of such issues effectively.
Traveler: Anyway, let's bring you up to speed...
Black Screen Text: You shed a little light on the matters so far...
Ann: So, Seymour is searching for Mary-Ann...
Paimon: Agh! No wonder that name felt familiar! The person Seymour mentioned and is looking for is also named Mary-Ann!
Seymour: Note: Regular record space collation can decrease the frequency of such issues effectively.
Paimon: Hey! Ugh, Paimon's had it with you, you silly dog!
Paimon: Hmmm... According to what Seymour said before, they can't be the same Mary-Ann, right? The timing...
Seymour: Based on your statement, may I deduce that you have met someone named Mary-Ann in the past, or perhaps read or heard about such a person from sources apart from myself?
Paimon: Well, that was her name, that's for sure. Y'know what, let's do it like this — we can call the Mary-Ann in the Annapausis "Mary-Ann 1," and the one you're looking for, Seymour, can be "Mary-Ann 2"!
Seymour: Negative. The Ms. Mary-Ann I am searching for is of a higher sequential priority. To prevent confusion, she should be "Mary-Ann 1" instead.
Ann: Huh? Why don't you look at it this way, Seymour. 2 is bigger than 1. Doesn't that make it pretty good, too?
Seymour: Your claim... Sorting data fragments.
Traveler: Uh, looks like he's stopped functioning again...
Ann: Hehe, silly dog.
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon didn't think you had any mean bones in you, Ann, but you sure do!
Ann: Haha. I don't know why, but I suddenly felt compelled to do that...
Seymour: Preliminary data fragment sorting complete. For the following 15 reasons, Oceanid Ann, I assess that your perspective is illogical. Firstly—
Ann: Alright, alright, that stuff doesn't matter. Come, good doggie, sit.
Seymour: Understood.
Seymour: ...Why?
Ann: If you sit, we'll be able to improve photo-taking stability, right?
Seymour: Yes. Do you need to take a photo, Oceanid Ann? I am equipped with the most advanced optics from the Fontaine Institute of Natural Philosophy. I can—
Ann: Oh, there's no need, but thank you.
Seymour: Understood.
Paimon: Wow, Seymour's getting played left and right over here!
Traveler: Let's call a quick halt, please...
Paimon: Really... Anyway, wanna go to the Annapausis, Seymour? That way, you can meet that "Mary-Ann" and see if she's the one you're looking for or not.
Paimon: Yeah. That way, you can meet that "Mary-Ann" and see if she's the one you're looking for or not!
Ann: What you say makes sense, Paimon.
Seymour: Affirmative. A reasonable suggestion.
Paimon: Well, then let's go!
Ann: #Actually, Knight Traveler, Paimon, I don't think we'll need to trouble you this time. I can show Seymour the way!
Traveler: Are you sure you'll be fine?
Ann: Yes. I know Seymour's very reliable.
Paimon: That's right. Let's meet up here later, shall we?
Traveler: Take care, now.
Traveler: Do you want to go to the Annapausis, Seymour?

### Additional Talk 9

Black Screen Text: Caterpillar and Ann return to the Narzissenkreuz Ordo...
Seymour: Negative. Danger. Danger. Activity by Narzissenkreuz Ordo remnants detected.
Seymour: #Traveler, Paimon, please find a safe place immediately.
Seymour: Annihilation mode activated.
Paimon: Whoa, Seymour, calm down! This is...
Caterpillar: We meet again. What did the White Cavalier of Protection say about you? Ah, yes. "This is my little invention."
Seymour: Affirmative. I am... *garbled mechnical noises* prototype, with a large number of bold design elements.
Seymour: ...The priority level of this topic has been downgraded. Please lay down your arms and surrender.

Black Screen Text: You share some information...
Ann: So, you're searching for Mary-Ann, Seymour...
Paimon: Agh! No wonder that name felt familiar! The person Seymour mentioned and is looking for also goes by that name!
Seymour: Note: Regular record space collation can decrease the frequency of such issues effectively.
Paimon: Hey! Ugh, Paimon's had it with you, you silly dog!
Paimon: Hmmm... Based on what you said before, they can't be the same Mary-Ann, right? The timing...

Ann: Oh, there's no need, but thank you.
Seymour: Understood.
Paimon: Wow, Seymour's getting played left and right over here!
Traveler: Can we pause for a second...
Paimon: Still, when we first got here, Paimon couldn't help but notice... The clock here doesn't seem very accurate, does it?
Caterpillar: Ah. That.
Caterpillar: Simply put, it's the Doomsday Clock.
Traveler: Doomsday Clock?
Caterpillar: When the clock strikes midnight, the apocalypse will come.
Paimon: Huh? Doesn't this mean that the end of the world is almost upon us?
Caterpillar: Huh, that really does take me back. When I was here before, they thought the apocalypse was still far away, and that though it wouldn't happen in our generation, we should stop it for the sake of the future.
Caterpillar: If the clock is accurate, then it is not far off now. Perhaps we shall lay ourselves down to sleep tonight, and the sun shall not rise in the morn. Perhaps the sea shall evaporate tomorrow.
Caterpillar: Or perhaps we are already living in the apocalypse, and the good times have long ended.
Paimon: Hey! Get serious! Will the apocalypse really come?
Caterpillar: First, what we see is just a "clock," not the apocalypse itself. When it comes down to it, time is merely a tool humans use to measure changes in all forms of matter.
Caterpillar: Narzissenkreuz was the one who used the "world-formula" to calculate the beginning of the end, and built this device.
Caterpillar: As such, I cannot answer your question, dear Paimon. Because this is all it is — a clock.
Paimon: That's true, huh...
Traveler: Anyway, let's share our findings...
Black Screen Text: You and Paimon briefly share all that happened with the other three people (though technically speaking, none of them are humans).
Seymour: Input logged.
Ann: Elynas...
Traveler: Did you think of something?
Ann: I don't know. I'm not sure. It's like water boiling off into gas. I can't see it, and I can't quite grasp it, either.
Paimon: Oh. Any thoughts or leads, Caterpillar?
Caterpillar: Hmm... Can't say that I don't, but I'm still trying to sort some things out, so let's discuss this later.
Caterpillar: Right. I kept forgetting to ask you something.
Caterpillar: #Traveler, Paimon, I'm very grateful for everything you've done for Lanoire. So, is there anything that I can help you with?
Paimon: Huh? Do you mean... anything? Just like making a wish?
Caterpillar: Haha! It should be something within the scope of my abilities, of course. You did free Lanoire and I from prison, but I'm no Jinn in a bottle.
Traveler: So, what would your wish be, Paimon?
Paimon: Hmm, if that's the case, then Mora... No, wait, yummy food...
Paimon: Aah! There's so much that Paimon wants, but...
Paimon: We've been having lots of fun traveling together, so we don't really need anything special. Instead, Caterpillar, can you help us help Ann and Seymour?
Ann: Paimon...
Paimon: #Traveler, what do you think? Is that a good wish?
Traveler: That'll do, Paimon. That'll do.
Caterpillar: I understand. Then, let us work together.
Ann: Yeah!
Seymour: Understood.
Caterpillar: #Now, I plan to work with Seymour and Ann to see if we can use our experiences and the information available here to figure something new out. Traveler, Paimon, let's meet back here later.
Traveler: S'all good.
