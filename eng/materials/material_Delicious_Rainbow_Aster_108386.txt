# Delicious Rainbow Aster

A unique drink. Calla Lilies from Mondstadt and Lavender Melons from Inazuma meet from across mountains and seas before having their flavors blended together to perfection using smooth milk. Novel satisfaction guaranteed â€” indeed, it is utterly unsurprising that the ill Shogun in the tale was re-energized by the merits of this drink alone.
