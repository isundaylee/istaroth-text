Traveler: How's the situation?
Lorgar: It's not looking too good... The hilichurls have been increasingly active recently, it's becoming quite a headache.
Lorgar: But there's not much I can do beyond warning the adventurers and travelers around here to watch their backs.
Lorgar: Here are some notes I jotted down, maybe you'll find them helpful. Take care now.

Traveler: Have you seen anyone who looks a lot like me?
Lorgar: Someone like you? Why, yes, I believe I have...
Lorgar: A lot of young adventurers like you will come tramping into the Stormbearer Mountains. I turn most of them back, which is good, since it's quite dangerous up ahead...
Lorgar: Oh— You're looking for a relative, then? I'm sorry, I misunderstood you.
Lorgar: I don't think the person you're looking for has come to the Stormbearer Mountains. Best you go look somewhere else.

Traveler: ...What's wrong?
Lorgar: Your attire... Could you be the traveler they spoke of?
Lorgar: Huh? You don't? Your heroic deeds have already spread across Mondstadt. I heard that it was you who put an end to the storms that terrorized Mondstadt!
Lorgar: Though I believe you're capable of dealing with the monsters ahead, I'd still like to ask you to watch out and take care.
