Erfan: Pfft... Makes me laugh every time...

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you...
Erfan: I am the one who walks under the veil of night, a listener of drunkards' most honest confessions...
Erfan: Hahaha, just kiddin'! I'm just a bartender working night shifts here.
Erfan: Many come here to drink at night. Some of them might get quite drunk. So Lambad had me take some of Qishan's shifts.
Erfan: An Akademiya student during the day and a bartender at night. I'd say I've managed to keep a good work-study balance.

## Talk

Traveler: Is there anything fun about this place?
Erfan: Of course, there's lots of fun stuff.
Erfan: This is a tavern, after all. The last thing we lack is funny drunkards.
Erfan: Like last time, a student who had just come of age drank too much at his birthday party and, as a result, tried to have a duel with a chair.
Erfan: ...Well, the chair definitely turned out to be the stronger duelist.
Erfan: A Liyue student who came with him captured the hilarious moment and sent the pictures to The Steambird overnight.
Erfan: Guess what, one of the pictures earned the Second Prize for journalistic photography. I heard it was only second to the work of The Steambird's top reporter.
Erfan: If I were the drunken student, I'd blackmail... send a letter to ask for royalties.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Erfan: Goodbye... Hahaha...

## Talk

Traveler: About Qishan...
Erfan: Qishan is the bartender during the day. Have you met her already?
Erfan: She's a student from Liyue who is now preparing for the entrance exam to the Akademiya. She also works to cover her tuition. That's hardly an easy life.
Erfan: I want to help, but I'm from a different school than the one she's aiming for.
Erfan: So I sometimes invite students from that school over for a drink. This way, she can discuss academic questions with them.
Erfan: I hope she will pass the exam. That will make me her senior!
