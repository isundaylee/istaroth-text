Traveler: About the Lochknights...
Goldoni: Fret not about the lies those slaves tell. Their so-called Lochknights are but facetious far-fetched fictions.
Goldoni: They spread rumors and call those barbarians who worship a false god "knights," believing that they shall one day free them from their fated duties.
Goldoni: I do not condemn such folly, for folly is the way of the lowly. Yet their delusions are fanned ever hotter, such that their melodies are tranquil no longer.
Goldoni: They must be cured. Once the disturbances here have subsided, I shall act forcefully to correct such strange skeins of supposition.
Goldoni: Delusion and weakness both breed turmoil.
