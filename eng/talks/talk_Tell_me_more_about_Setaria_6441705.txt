Traveler: Tell me more about Setaria...
Ramiz: Setaria's been hanging around the village a lot these days, but she always looks super busy and hasn't been able to read with me much.
Ramiz: I get it, though! She's here to do some really important work, I'm sure of that! Granny says that the thing she's working on will make life in the village better!
Ramiz: I wanna learn loads of stuff too so I can help her!
