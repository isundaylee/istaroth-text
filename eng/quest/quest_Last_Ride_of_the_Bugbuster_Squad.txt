# Last Ride of the Bugbuster Squad


## Talk 1

Paimon: We've still got one last place to go, come on!

## Talk 2

Ororon: #Xilonen? Traveler, Paimon, you two as well? Hello!
Xilonen: Ororon? What's wrong?
Traveler: Have you recovered?
Ororon: Thank you for your concern. Granny spent a few days pouring bitter stuff down my throat and forcing me to rest, and I'm much better now.
Paimon: Hey, Ororon! Are you here to help Xilonen catch Aphids?
Ororon: Aphids? Oh! So you were the ones who kidnapped Hundred Percent Sweetness...
Ororon: No wonder Extreme Sweetness and Unusually Sweet also disappeared... It was you all along.
Xilonen: Uh... Are those all the names of Aphids?
Ororon: Yep.
Ororon: It makes it easier to tell them apart. I don't actually judge them, after all, they're still amazing even if they don't produce honeydew.
Paimon: So... These Aphids... were all raised by you?
Ororon: Actually, I don't really do much that would interfere with their natural behaviors. We just happen to live in the same territory. It's a kind of relationship where we just get along with each other.
Xilonen: Uh... Sorry, I had no idea. But they were contaminated by the Abyss, which was affecting the tribe, so we had to take care of that.
Paimon: Yeah, that's right! ...And we didn't harm them, either, just so you know!
Ororon: Really? That's good. Still, no need to worry, it's not a big deal. In fact, I myself came here to deal with that problem.
Ororon: But I must set the record straight. The Aphids weren't contaminated by the Abyss. They're smart little creatures who chose to eat the Abyssal energy.
Paimon: Say what now? They chose to eat it?
Ororon: Exactly. They only eat a little bit at a time. Though that little bit is enough to make their bodies expand, but it won't kill them.
Ororon: After a while, they'll fly somewhere far away, and then create Phlogiston Honey Pearls that bind up the contaminants inside.
Ororon: The outer shell of the Pearl acts as a barrier against the contamination, and this way, they can slowly strip away the Abyssal energy from their home.
Ororon: Though the process must be repeated over and over and over, but they're all patient critters. Even if the ants move, it isn't a problem.
Paimon: Oh... So they're protecting their home...
Xilonen: First I've heard of it as well. So they know the land is being invaded, too.
Ororon: Yes, Hundred Percent Sweetness and the rest have been fighting hard! They're all really great, capable Aphids.
Traveler: Guess that's "Natlan, the Nation of War" for you.
Xilonen: Though, Ororon, how did you find this place?
Ororon: Oh, that's because I fed them some Numberry seeds. They can't digest them, so it doesn't take long for them to excrete them.
Ororon: After the seeds hit the ground, they grow quickly, turning into fruiting bushes. If I follow the bushes, I can find them.
Ororon: Then I gather the Honey Pearls they produce and take care of them, and then use more Numberries to bring them back.
Ororon: But it seems like you guys have already done all that for me, and didn't harm them in the process. Really, I'm very grateful to you all.
Paimon: So that's what was going on with the Numberries! Paimon was draining all her brain juice trying to figure out if there was some kind of plot behind them...
Ororon: Huh? Did I cause you any trouble?
Paimon: No, not at all! Don't worry about it!
Xilonen: Ororon, rest assured that we will return all the Abyss-cleaning Aphids back to you, just as they were.
Ororon: That would be just perfect! They're all very important living beings, and must be treated well.
Ororon: Well, since the problem's already taken care of, I'll see you all later! Feel free to drop by and visit me next time, I'll take you to see some other good friends of mine.
Traveler: Then I'll be looking forward to it. Until next time.
Xilonen: Phew! I never imagined things would turn out quite like this. That Ororon sure is a master of "surprises."
Xilonen: And thank you both. Without the two of you around, this would've been one boring trip.
Xilonen: This is for you. It's an uncontaminated Phlogiston Honey Pearl. Don't worry, it's not valuable.
Xilonen: Just think of it like a memento, something to remember these tiny warriors who fight for Natlan by.
