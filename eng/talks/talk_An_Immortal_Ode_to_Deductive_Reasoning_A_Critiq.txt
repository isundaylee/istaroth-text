Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "An Immortal Ode to Deductive Reasoning â€” A Critique of 'Great Detective Hurlock'"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): As one who once served in the Maison Gardiennage, yours truly is quite conflicted about "Great Detective Hurlock."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): On the one hand, we must be very clear that this is a work of fiction, and it is obviously not related to the realities faced by us. On the other, his personal charisma is a call for all of us to devote ourselves to the noble cause of justice.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "For the sake of society's justice, I will destroy you and your evil, even if the price is my own annihilation." These words resonate with all who carry justice in our hearts and give voice to our innermost feelings.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): And thus I am deeply grateful to the author for gifting such a magnificent work to Fontaine and all of us. To all fellow lovers of art and justice, let us meet at the old site of the Liliacruces Ordo!
