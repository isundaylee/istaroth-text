## Talk

Kaedehara Kazuha: #Hello there, Traveler.
Kaedehara Kazuha: There was a familiar scent upon the wind. I guessed that you would come.

## Talk

Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm... I'm very happy to have someplace to settle down for a time.
Kaedehara Kazuha: When I'm by myself, I often look outside just to appreciate the scenery.
Kaedehara Kazuha: With no one around, one's heart will naturally calm.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Tomorrow is uncertain, but at least I'll always have the stability of the present.
Kaedehara Kazuha: A pity that I can't reside here for long, for my blade will dull.
Traveler: You can come here for a rest whenever you want.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I am most thankful.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Each year yields scorching summers and frigid winters. The hottest and coldest days are difficult for me to weather.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But the weather here is always comfortable...
Kaedehara Kazuha: It is truly a blessing to leisurely pass one's time here.
Traveler: You are always welcome here.

## Talk

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Kaedehara Kazuha: Alright... but what to talk about...? Let me think.
Kaedehara Kazuha: The rainy season recently set itself upon us. Any topics pertaining to rain?
Traveler: I always seem to run into heavy rain outside...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hm, if the rain is heavy, I'll usually seek shelter.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Caves are my primary choice, but if there's a wild animal inside, you must first contest it.
Kaedehara Kazuha: My second choice is an abandoned temple, but there are usually drafts and the omnipresent scent of mold.
Kaedehara Kazuha: If there are no other options, I'll shelter under a tree.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But I don't dare do this in a thunderstorm — too dangerous.
Kaedehara Kazuha: As a last resort, I'll try my luck on houses with their lights on... Of course, I'll give up if I'm unlucky.
Traveler: Why is staying at someone's home your last choice?
Kaedehara Kazuha: If someone with a blade knocks on the door during a rainy night, most people would be on their guard.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Understanding this, there's no need to bother them. Besides, the world is vast and there is always somewhere to go.
Kaedehara Kazuha: No need for worry. The outdoors won't always be rainy, and one's life won't always be overcast.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Turn your gaze skyward on a clear night, and you will see thousands of stars.
Traveler: Any recommendations for shelter?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm...

## Talk

Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm... please take this.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I heard that the maple leaves back home have already turned red. I want to go back and take a look, but it's a long journey. I can't return for now...
Kaedehara Kazuha: I was wandering the market the other day and saw these well-preserved maple leaves, so I bought some.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Although I can't confirm whether they're from my hometown, they still help blunt my homesickness.
Traveler: You're very fond of maple leaves, then?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes.
Kaedehara Kazuha: In the past, I collected maple leaves upon the autumnal winds and carried them on my person.
Kaedehara Kazuha: When I was on the boat, I scattered them across the surface of the ocean and watched them float to distant shores.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Perhaps another homesick soul will have picked up one of those leaves...
Traveler: I also want to see your hometown.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Ah... How improper of me.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I should have taken the initiative to invite you... But I was absorbed by my own homesickness.
Traveler: Don't worry about it.
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...Thank you.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Then take this maple leaf as a keepsake. Our promise is thus made.
Kaedehara Kazuha: When the maple leaves next bloom red, we shall go to my hometown together.
Traveler: I sympathize with you.
Traveler: It looks quite beautiful.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Indeed... From a purely visual perspective, red maple leaves have a unique beauty to them.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Every year in my hometown, people enjoy the scene of falling red leaves.
Kaedehara Kazuha: The maple leaves are a crimson sunset and fall like scarlet rain.
Kaedehara Kazuha: A thick layer of fallen leaves on the ground, the chirping of autumn insects, and the wandering birds...

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Kazuha.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Good morning... It feels like you're somehow different today.
Kaedehara Kazuha: You can talk to me about anything. Although I cannot guarantee anything else, I'm a very good listener.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Kazuha.
Kaedehara Kazuha: #Good night, Traveler.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Tonight's wind is gentle, so there should be a plentitude of wonderful dreams.

## Talk

Kaedehara Kazuha: A tranquil teahouse, with finely crafted ornamentation and the scent of tea lingering in the air...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Mm... The atmosphere here is truly delightful.
Kaedehara Kazuha: When you can spare the time, why not join me to discuss our favorite poetry over tea?

## Talk

Kaedehara Kazuha: This peaceful scene puts the mind at ease.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Even the most ordinary stretch of countryside, the humblest of hills, harbors poignant profundities from the distant past.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Offer them your full, undivided attention, and each flower, each tree, each blade of grass will whisper their stories to you.
