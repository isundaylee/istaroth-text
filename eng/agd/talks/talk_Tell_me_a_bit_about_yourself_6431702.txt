Traveler: Tell me a bit about yourself...
Uncle Anpu: I've been the head of Aaru Village for a long time now. If anything happens, just come find me.
Uncle Anpu: Food, lodgings... Whatever I can help with, I will, to the best of my abilities.
Uncle Anpu: Also, if you encounter loose sands or abnormally strong winds out there in the desert, it's safer if you take shelter in the village as soon as possible.
Uncle Anpu: ...Well, these don't always guarantee that a sandstorm will follow, but it never hurts to be careful...
Uncle Anpu: Haha, would you look at that? I'm getting long-winded in my old age. Please don't mind me, youngster, hehe...
