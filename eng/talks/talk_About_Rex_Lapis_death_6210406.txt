Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Iron Shoulder: If we hadn't gone through with the Rite of Parting, I would have found it hard to believe that Rex Lapis is gone.
Iron Shoulder: I used to think that he alone would remain, even long after Liyue Harbor or any of the seven nations had passed away.
Iron Shoulder: *sigh* I have no idea what his passing means for Liyue, or for the Blackcliff Forge... I just hope I won't lose my job!
