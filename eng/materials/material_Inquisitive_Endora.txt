# Inquisitive Endora

A strange Lochfolk larva, filled with curiosity about the world at large.
Lochfolk specialize in shifting into watery shapes and can meld with other water bodies to synchronize emotions and knowledge alike. Endora is still small, and Endora is very curious. Endora can spit out bubbles to meld with other beings of water, through which she shall learn everything.
