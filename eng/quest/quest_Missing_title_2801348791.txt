## Talk 11

Bulletin Board: Since the Mahamata won't be using this to post announcements anymore, it's perfect as a message board for our tavern. Please feel free to leave a message here.
Bulletin Board: "Have the ten crates of wine that I ordered arrived? I came yesterday only to find out they didn't arrive."
Bulletin Board: "That's impossible! A blond person came in here earlier claiming to be your roommate and took it all. I even remember both of you coming in together the other day. You must have made a mistake."
Bulletin Board: "...Alright. I get it."

## Talk 12

Bulletin Board: "Be careful if you're planning a trip to the rainforest. My mentor sent me there to collect some herbs the other day, and I almost lost my life to a Rishboland Tiger."
Bulletin Board: "I was lucky to be saved by a Forest Ranger nearby. She called herself a Trainee Forest Ranger, but she seemed really experienced. Most importantly, she gave me delicious food to help ease my shock."
