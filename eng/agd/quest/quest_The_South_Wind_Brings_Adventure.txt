# The South Wind Brings Adventure


## Talk 1

Stanley: *panting*
Jack: I was so sure I was about to die!
Venti: To be fair, that could have gone either way.
Venti: So — you must be Jack the Adventurer, I assume?
Jack: Yes... Who are you?
Paimon: Actually, we came looking for you.
Venti: Ellin has a message for you. She said she won't be able to join you today to plan out your next adventure together. She'll join you some other time.
Jack: Oh, I see... I feel bad you had to come all this way to find me... and then had to rescue me...
Stanley: Huh? I don't see what all the fuss is about. It was nothing that I, Stanley, couldn't have dealt with by myself!
Paimon: Whoa, you're Stanley? You're that legendary adventurer? Renowned in all of Mondstadt? Who once set foot in the Mare Jivari!?
Stanley: Hehehe, the very same!
Venti: Hahaha! I must say, it's an honor to meet one as legendary as yourself.
Venti: Well then, how would everyone like to proceed? Head back, or head further inside?
Traveler: Stanley, what do you think?
Stanley: Hehehe, well... I think you're now in the safe hands of Stanley, the great explorer and legend of Mondstadt!
Stanley: In which case, why head back now?
Venti: Okay, motion passed by unanimous consent! Let's head further in.
Traveler: Jack, what do you think?
Jack: I think we should keep going. With Stanley by our side, we'll have no problem.

## Talk 2

Venti: Traveler, I believe I have made a small discovery.
Venti: Could I ask you to use the nirnama detector once more?
Paimon: What? Stanley has an imaginary friend?
Venti: It seems his imaginary friend is a seasoned warrior... covered in scars from head to foot, and a look of staunch determination on his face.
Traveler: It fits Stanley's description of himself.
Venti: You're saying his imaginary friend is an idealized version of his own self?
Venti: Interesting idea! But is it true?
Stanley: Please excuse me, I'll be leaving now.
Jack: Bye, Stanley!
Jack: Do you two still have time to spare?
Venti: What is it?
Jack: A few days ago, Stanley got drunk and told me a secret — something he's never told anyone before.
Jack: The weapons he took on his adventure all those years ago... they were none other than those once wielded by Mondstadt's greatest hero, Vennessa herself! The *Sword of Brilliant Valor* and the *Shield of Magnificent Honor*!
Jack: I don't know whether you believe me, but... apparently, both the sword and shield are still right here in Mondstadt, over in *Dadaupa Gorge*!
Jack: Since you guys are the experts at this... Can you come with me to try and retrieve these two legendary weapons?
Traveler: Stanley seriously owned these weapons?
Jack: You bet! This is Stanley we're talking about!
Jack: If I can just get ahold of something impressive enough to show my family what I'm capable of, maybe they'll finally come around to the idea of me being an adventurer...
Jack: Right now, I'm just a rookie. My abilities are limited, and my parents don't support my goals one bit...
Jack: So, what do you say? Help a guy out?
Jack: I can't bring myself to tell Stanley about it, because my reasons are so... selfish. But, I swear I'll give the weapons back to him as soon as I'm done!
Paimon: Aw, poor Jack... Let's help him out!
Traveler: Alright then.
Paimon: Venti, you coming too?
Venti: Mm... I don't know...
Jack: Oh, one other thing — I have a bottle of rare vintage wine that I had someone fetch for me a couple years ago. Help me find these weapons and it's all yours!
Venti: Oh, *Dadaupa Gorge*, was it? Hehe, let's hurry, there's no time to lose!
Traveler: Hard to say no after that sob story.
Traveler: Why did he abandon them in the wild, then?
Jack: I dunno, outstanding individuals always come with their quirks, right?
Traveler: I knew there was something weird about his story...
Venti: Oh? You thought so too, huh?
Venti: I agree. He wasn't telling the whole story.
