Traveler: How have you been recently?
Kumi: Thanks for your concern. I've been doing quite well.
Kumi: Originally, I'd only intended to say goodbye to Kuntira and make peace with some parts of my life.
Kumi: But now, I feel like this place is more like my home than Narukami Island... And I can experience new joys here that are more than just memories.
Kumi: So I feel that continuing to live here isn't bad either.
