# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Can you run me through your background again?
Liben: I'm Liben, and once upon a time I sold curios.
Liben: But I've finally said goodbye to that now that I've made it enough to rub shoulders with the Qixing. No more Mr. Small-Time Merchant for me!
Liben: And that's why you and I are about to start doing business together, and both of us are going to make a handsome sum!
Traveler: What kind of business?
Liben: Simple. You find me a few basic every items, cooking ingredients and the like, and then you trade them with me for a Box o' Marvels, full of all kinds of nice little treasures.
Liben: Keep in mind that I've filled these Boxes o' Marvels with the fortune I made in my time as a seller of curios. There's no booby prizes to be found here, and I treat all my customers the same.
Liben: Why box them up and turn it into a lucky draw, you say?
Liben: What can I say, people like a gift box. It just makes everyone a little more inclined to get involved.
Traveler: How do you earn any money like this?
Liben: See, this is where the clever bit comes in.
Liben: I have recently become privy to some highly confidential intel from the Qixing. It's tough times ahead for the whole of Teyvat, apparently.
Liben: If I start stockpiling everyday essentials now, before long I'll be able to sell them off at much higher prices and make a huge profit.
