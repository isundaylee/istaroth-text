Traveler: Who are you?
Yizheng: Greetings! I'm Yizheng, one of the workers here at the dock. I'm in charge of short-distance transport of small items between Qingce Village and Chenyu Vale.
Yizheng: As you can see, Wangshu Inn is just up ahead. That's where this route ends.
Yizheng: But I haven't been able to visit it via boat because I get seasick easily.
Yizheng: I've heard the food there is really good, though.
