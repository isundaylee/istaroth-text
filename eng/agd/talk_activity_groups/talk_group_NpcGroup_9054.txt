Sangonomiya Kokomi: #Oh, you have returned, Traveler.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I've just wrapped up the administrative affairs for today. Perhaps we can afford a moment to relax together?

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I felt a little like a fish out of water when I first arrived.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I mean... After years of studying the art of war, I can't help but consider all the strategic points upon arriving in a new place like this.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Where would the enemy troops set up camp? From which direction could they mount an assault? And what strategies should we implement to counter these factors?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: We need a barricade here... another sentry tower there... I began to instinctively consider all these things when I first arrived here.
Traveler: It's quite safe inside the Serenitea Pot, you know.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm... Yes, I eventually realized that I was overthinking things.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: After residing here for a while, I've grown more accustomed to the scenery and my mind has gradually come to be at peace.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: If you ask me, I would say this is almost an ideal place. I can easily separate myself from the outside world and enjoy some time to myself...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Oh, but could I rent a room to use as a command post? I need a place to lay out my maps and battle scenarios.
Traveler: Of course you can.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Splendid. I would certainly like to stay here for some time. I can just lay on my bed and enjoy my strategy books, far from the pressures of social interaction.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I'll finally have all the energy I need every day. Mm, just thinking about it makes me happy.
Traveler: But, won't you feel lonely?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Perhaps, if I'm all alone.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: But, you'll still be here, correct?

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Sure, what would you like to talk about?
Traveler: I'd like to hear more about you, Kokomi.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: More about me? Mm... I don't mind. I only worry that you may find the topic a little boring.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I remember I used to always stay home all by myself when I was little. I didn't really have any friends... In fact, I seldom spoke to anyone.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: When I found myself bored with little to do, I would skim through the various books we had lying around the house.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Among the piles of texts on governmental affairs and diplomacy, there were a few books on the art of war. They were like gems to me.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I remember thinking at the time that it would be perfect to work as an adviser someday. Whenever Her Excellency would come to me for advice, I could put on a show and mysteriously hand her a directive.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Then, I could just snuggle right back up in my blanket and continue sleeping with no fear of anyone disrupting me.
Traveler: However, in reality...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm. I suppose I never expected that someone like me who was used to staying home would be promoted to such a position.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I clearly remember that on my first day as priestess, I had well over one hundred people come pay their respects to me.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I did my best to carefully record each of their names, but after about twenty people or so, I had already lost track.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Eventually, I would feign that I was busy handling administrative affairs while using the papers to make a rough sketch of them with their name noted to the side for memorization later.
Traveler: That sounds pretty tiresome.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm... This is why I am so happy whenever I see you making progress.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Perhaps one day, you'll be even more suited than myself to appear before people, and even better prepared to carry their hopes forward.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: When that day comes, I can serve as your adviser. Wouldn't that be nice?

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: If the opportunity arises, I would like to take you diving with me.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The world is full of troubles. But when compared with the vastness of the sea, all those troubles seem to just fade away.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Though the ages pass and time brings change, the sea continues as it always has. As I float down among the depths of the sea, a deep tranquility permeates my heart.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: There are times when I feel utterly exhausted, so I thought I should share with you the way that I unwind.
Traveler: But how would I breathe underwater?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm... That is indeed a problem.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Wait, I've come up with a clever solution.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I'll wrap the two of us in a gigantic bubble... We can slowly sink down into the sea together.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: This way, we can journey together underwater! You'll feel refreshed before you know it.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Though I've never gone diving together with anyone before, I must say that I certainly look forward to it.
Traveler: Is there anything that I should prepare beforehand?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: No, not at all. The purpose of the trip is to relax, after all. Simply do as you please.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Besides, you will have the "grand strategist" accompanying you.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: You need only focus on resting and I'll take care of the details.
Traveler: I wouldn't call myself the best swimmer...

## Talk

Traveler: Morning, Kokomi.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: #Good morning, Traveler. I trust you slept well?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: A journey is much like a battle, you cannot set out exhausted.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Kokomi.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: #Good night, Traveler.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It'll be my turn to make breakfast tomorrow. You'll be able to sleep in.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I'll be sure to wake you once breakfast is ready.

## Talk

Sangonomiya Kokomi: The distance between the bed and the kotatsu is exactly right, and the placement of the wardrobe is eminently sensible... I like this bedroom very much.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: My bedroom is my quiet space. Once I close the door, no one can disturb me...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: ...With the exception of you, of course.

## Talk

Sangonomiya Kokomi: Wow... You kept this a secret, didn't you?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: There are all kinds of texts here, even my favorite periodicals. Does this mean... You read them, too?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I—I'd love to hear what you think about them!
