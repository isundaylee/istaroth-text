Traveler: You believe that he intended all this?
Betresa: Though I am not sure what you are referring to specifically, I would think so.
Betresa: Lord Bamoun had hoped for change to come all his life, which is why he treasured his relationship with Sir Cyrus.
Betresa: He believed that the challenges he took upon himself could bring the changes to the current situation that we needed.
Betresa: And as you have seen, Lord Sethos has succeeded him as our new leader.
Betresa: As surely as we have eyes to witness it, the Akademiya and the Temple of Silence shall begin building bridges between them once more... It comes a little late, but I believe it is what Lord Bamoun desired.
Betresa: He and his grandson, Lord Sethos, were very close, and they must have agreed on this long ago.
