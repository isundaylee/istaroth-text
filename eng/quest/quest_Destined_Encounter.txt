# Destined Encounter


## Talk 1

Masrur: Huh? Wait, you're that blond traveler who's on a journey to all corners of Teyvat, right?
Paimon: Who's asking...? Do you need something from us?
Masrur: You bet I do! Phew, I was worried I wouldn't be able to find you! I have a letter for you, you see — it's from another outlander...
Masrur: He was a crafty fellow, lemme tell you... Took advantage of a loophole in our mailing system by opting for Guaranteed Delivery then filling in the most obscure mailing address I've ever seen!
Paimon: Well, we are always on the road, so yeah, it's pretty tough to get mail to us unless we happen to go to the post office on a whim...
Paimon: So, um... what address did that person give you, anyway?
Masrur: Uh... he just wrote, "next to a small, white-haired talking fairy."
Paimon: What!? So the address is Paimon!?
Masrur: *sigh* Exactly, right? And if I'd failed to deliver the letter, I'd have been bound by regulation to compensate him...
Masrur: Really, he got me good. I count myself very lucky that I ran into you here.
Traveler: Great. Well, lemme see this letter.
Masrur: Of course, here it is. All yours!
Paimon: C'mon, Paimon wants to have a look, too!
Paimon: Kaeya, huh? So he's here in Sumeru... Hmm, now that Paimon thinks about it, "crafty" does describe him pretty well.
Traveler: Yeah. Can't say I'm hugely surprised.
Paimon: From what he wrote in the letter, it looks like he didn't think there was much chance of it reaching us...
Paimon: Hmm, or maybe he's just being sneaky... Do you think he's making this sound like a miracle of fate so that we'd have to go meet up with him?
Traveler: Very scheming indeed...
Paimon: Eh, yeah, you're right. It's always nice to see old friends!
Paimon: The letter says that he hangs out at Djafar Tavern every afternoon. Perhaps we should drop in on him then, huh?
Traveler: Well, no harm done. It'll be nice to catch up with him.
Traveler: This is definitely Kaeya's style.
Traveler: Lemme see this letter. I'm really curious who could've sent it...

## Talk 2

Masrur: This was a first for me. It's a good thing luck was on my side...

## Talk 3

Kaeya: ...I'll have something I haven't tried yet, Boss.
Eymen: Um... Sorry, Sir, I'm afraid you've already tried every type of liquor we serve...
Kaeya: Oh? Well then, just the bill, please. It's just as well, I suppose. I do have other matters to attend to...
Paimon: Kaeya! You're really here! Paimon half thought you were playing some sort of prank on us...
Kaeya: #Hey, Paimon, {NICKNAME}. Looks like the gods smile upon me after all. And come now, I wouldn't joke about wanting to see my good friends, haha...
Traveler: If you say so.
Paimon: Wait a second, you must be here on official business, right? What do you think you're doing, spending every afternoon drinking at the tavern? You itching for a lecture from Jean?
Kaeya: Hahaha, not at all. The Acting Grand Master positively terrifies me. Why would I ever do anything that might displease her?
Traveler: Uh-huh... Very believable.
Kaeya: The truth is, I'm in Sumeru to learn about the alcohol industry here. So despite how it might look, I'm actually at Djafar Tavern for strictly business purposes.
Kaeya: Sumeru's spices are famous the world over, and it's long been rumored that this fine establishment was where a certain very popular spiced cocktail was invented.
Kaeya: That's why the Knights sent me, their foremost expert in alcoholic beverages, to come and see if it is as good as the rumors say.
Paimon: And how did that go?
Kaeya: So far so good... I'm already in talks with some spice merchants in Port Ormos about some potential collaboration.
Paimon: Yeah, that does sound like a great business opportunity. Guess Dawn Winery and Master Diluc are gonna make a tidy sum from this one too, huh?
Kaeya: Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves... Whether this lucrative opportunity gets passed along to Dawn Winery or not depends on how nice I'm feeling... Hahaha.
Paimon: Hey! Using your job to settle personal grievances isn't very knightly, Captain!
Traveler: ...I'm guessing you've been to Sumeru before?
Kaeya: Oh? What makes you say that?
Traveler: You came to Sumeru all on your own. So you must be quite familiar with the place.
Kaeya: Very sharp of you... I wouldn't say I'm familiar, though. I just came here on the sly once, when I was very young.
Kaeya: ...
Paimon: And? Do continue...
Kaeya: Heh... Do I have to? When I said we could talk about the old times, digging up my past wasn't exactly what I had in mind...
Traveler: Don't worry about it.
Kaeya: Well, alright, since you're so interested... Like I said, I was very young then. Dawn Winery had only just taken me in.
Kaeya: I overheard my adoptive father talk about sending a team of merchants to Sumeru during a business meeting.
Kaeya: I'm sure you'll agree that everyone's curious about their roots on some level. And my roots... They're in Khaenri'ah, which is said to have been located deep underground somewhere near Sumeru.
Traveler: Khaenri'ah...
Kaeya: And so I stowed myself away amidst the cargo, and silently joined the merchant delegation on their trip to Sumeru...
Kaeya: But it wasn't long before the merchant delegation received news that I'd gone missing. Their leader promptly found me, and before I knew it, my adoptive father was dragging me back home by the ear...
Kaeya: It was a short-lived adventure. Sorry I don't have a more thrilling story for you, hehe...
Traveler: Speaking of Khaenri'ah... How much do you know about it?
Kaeya: Honestly, not much. The only reason I knew that Khaenri'ah was near Sumeru is because I happened to read that in a book when I was young.
Kaeya: My life had less and less to do with Khaenri'ah as I grew up, and so I started caring less as well.
Kaeya: I used to believe that I had inherited some sort of duty from my father...
Kaeya: But then I began to wonder... Maybe my father left me in the peaceful land of Mondstadt for no other reason than simply to keep me alive...
Kaeya: As well as ensuring that I'd be safely cut off from certain things... The thought that I might be able to actually live a happy life there must have been the icing on the cake.
Kaeya: ...This is obviously all speculation. Simply put, I'm afraid that I'm not particularly in the know on this topic.
Kaeya: These days, my surname, Alberich, is probably the only link to Khaenri'ah that I have left.
Dainsleif: ...One Death After Noon please, Boss.
Traveler: ...?
Dainsleif: Tell me... what do you know about the significance of that name, "Alberich"?
Paimon: D—Dainsleif!?
Kaeya: Ah, you've decided to join us? I was wondering how long you planned on listening in. I believe I've seen you before in Mondstadt... Dainsleif, if I'm not mistaken?
Dainsleif: So you remember me. Then we are already acquainted, Kaeya Alberich... descendant of the Abyss Order's founder.
Kaeya: ...
Traveler: The Abyss Order...?
Paimon: What!?
Dainsleif: I take it that you weren't aware of this until now, Kaeya, or you wouldn't have been so forthcoming with your surname.
Kaeya: Oh, my... that's quite a lot of baggage for a surname, isn't it? Though I must say, it does confirm an old suspicion of mine. I suppose that was why my father left me in Mondstadt after all...
Dainsleif: I'm surprised that you take me at my word without the faintest hint of skepticism...
Kaeya: Well, perhaps what you told me just happens to answer some questions I carry in my memories. And, in any case... I recognize your eyes...
Kaeya: You're a pure-blood Khaenri'ahn, aren't you?
Dainsleif: Very clever. Forgive me for being direct, but I sincerely hope this new knowledge doesn't change anything. If you've already let go of your ties to the past... then keep it that way.
Paimon: Kaeya... You're not involved with the Abyss Order in any way, are you...?
Kaeya: Hey, hold on now. This conversation has taken a rather sudden turn for the deadly serious... and I'm afraid that as someone from Mondstadt, I'm not accustomed to this sort of atmosphere...
Kaeya: So what if I know my ancestry? Do I strike you as the type who would be bound by that kind of thing?
Kaeya: Relax. I'll be just as delighted to hunt down the Abyss Order tomorrow as I have always been.
Traveler: I trust you, Kaeya.
Kaeya: Either way, looks like we're out of time. I've got a spice merchant to meet in a minute, so I'll leave the three of you to carry on the conversation without me.
Paimon: Huh. Well, alright then... You go do your thing, Kaeya.
Kaeya: See you 'round. And Dainsleif, no need to listen in from the sidelines next time we meet. Let me buy you a drink.
Dainsleif: Hmph...
Paimon: You don't really trust him, do you, Dain? You're both from Khaenri'ah, but you get on like oil and water...
Dainsleif: The fact is, I still do not know him well. It would be meaningless for me to jump to conclusions.
Dainsleif: But can a person truly be unaffected by their ancestry? This remains to be seen.
Traveler: So, you said that an Alberich founded the Abyss Order?
Dainsleif: #Well, I suspect that they call your {M#sister}{F#brother} their {M#Princess}{F#Prince} precisely because there is a succession of sorts.
Paimon: #Oh, so if {M#she}{F#he} was the founder, {M#she}{F#he}'d be the {M#"Queen,"}{F#"King,"} right?
Traveler: So what do you plan to do here in Sumeru?
Dainsleif: I mean to investigate the "Loom of Fate." Do you remember that name?
Paimon: Yeah, the Abyss Order's evil plan! We learned about that back in Mondstadt.
Traveler: You've got a new lead?
Dainsleif: Not new. Not exactly... My memories suffer from erosion, but while I was recovering my health recently, I suddenly remembered something...
Dainsleif: #Your {M#sister}{F#brother}... {M#she}{F#he} mentioned the "Loom of Fate" back when we traveled together.
Traveler: All the way back then?
Dainsleif: Apparently so. I was also quite surprised when these memories tallied up. I recall that we were traveling to Sumeru when the matter was brought up.
Paimon: #So you're going to the place that {M#she}{F#he} mentioned back then?
Dainsleif: Correct. At that time, they must have been introduced, in one way or another, to this concept. If I recall correctly, we were somewhere in Avidya Forest then...
Paimon: Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go! Maybe we'll discover some secret that's lain hidden for hundreds of years!
Dainsleif: No. Now is not the time.
Traveler: Are you concerned about the Abyss Order?
Dainsleif: No, it's just...
Dainsleif: I'm still waiting for my drink.
Paimon: Seriously...?
Black Screen Text: After Dain finishes his drink, you prepare to travel to Avidya Forest...
Traveler: Are we waiting for the perfect moment?
Traveler: So that was already a thing several centuries ago?
Traveler: I thought my sibling was the founder...
Traveler: I think... I guess.
Traveler: You don't have to go into great detail.
Traveler: You? Terrified? I don't buy it.
Traveler: We've missed you too.

## Talk 4

Kaeya: Oho? What a coincidence, I just finished my talks with the Sumeru merchant. Didn't expect to bump into you again.
Kaeya: Shall we head back to the tavern for a drink? I'd like to chat with you about what happened during last year's Windblume Festival. Now that was really...
Kaeya: ...Ah, I see you have other things to do with your time. Busy as ever, hmm? Alright then, remember to come see me at the Angel's Share when next you're in Mondstadt. Safe travels.

## Talk 5

Dainsleif: I doubt that the appearance of those monsters was wholly random. There must be something nearby that attracted them.
Dainsleif: A Ley Line anomaly, perhaps? ...Hmm, but it seems to be more than that.
Dainsleif: Okay — I'll go slightly further out to investigate any issues with the nearby Ley Lines. I might be a while. You should wait for me here.
Paimon: What? You're going alone? You'd better not be trying to keep some secret from us!
Dainsleif: ...Your suspicions are as banal as they are unwarranted. I merely think that this house should remain the focus of our investigation, and as such, someone ought to stay here and keep an eye on it.
Dainsleif: Not to mention that if even Forest Rangers are capable of investigating Ley Lines, I will be more than able to handle it alone.
Paimon: Ugh, fair enough. Guess we'll just camp out here, then?
Paimon: Good thing there's a bonfire over there. Let's make ourselves something to eat! All this running around has made Paimon real hungry.

## Talk 6

Black Screen Text: You and Paimon make a fire, and before you know it, night sets in.
Paimon: Ahh, your cooking is as good as ever! Even if there was no other reason, the food alone would be enough for Paimon to stick with you, hee-hee!
Traveler: Well, freeloading comes more naturally to you than most...
Paimon: Changing the subject, Dain's taking forever! He said that there might be an issue with the nearby Ley Lines... How bad do you think it could be?
Paimon: *sigh* We came together, but now it's back to just being the two of us again... Y'know, now that Paimon mentions it, we really have spent lots and lots of time together, haven't we?
Paimon: Um, so... don't take this the wrong way or anything, but, uh... d—do you ever get tired of Paimon being around?
Traveler: You make my day every day, Paimon.
Paimon: ...Aww, oh you, stop it! Now you're embarrassing Paimon...
Paimon: #Hmm... So, um, next question... Don't know if it's okay to ask this, but Paimon's curious: What was it like traveling with your {M#sister}{F#brother}?
Traveler: ...
Paimon: The stars?
Traveler: We'd gaze at the stars, just like this.
Paimon: Wow...
Traveler: We traveled through the universe, always by each other's side...
Traveler: This is the first time we've ever been separated.
Paimon: Yeah... Paimon understands. Being separated without even knowing the reason why... it's just terrible.
Paimon: But we'll find the truth together, sure as Paimon's your guide! Just you wait, Heavenly Principles! And you too, Teyvat!
Traveler: Just you wait, Heavenly Principles!
Paimon: Uh... Y'know what? We've talked too long about this sad stuff. Let's talk about something happy instead! 'Cause if you're sad... Paimon will be too.
Traveler: Don't worry about it, Paimon.
Paimon: Alright, alright. It's getting dark, so why don't you rest? Paimon will take first watch. Don't worry, no monster's gonna come and eat you up!
Traveler: Well, that's a first. Paimon, not going to bed before me?
Paimon: Oh, come on, don't say that... Paimon just wants to look after you for once.
Traveler: Alright.
Paimon: Nighty-night! Go on, shoo, off to sleep!
Traveler: Goodnight then, Paimon.
Traveler: Thank you, Paimon.
Traveler: And you too, Teyvat!
Traveler: If nothing else... I just want to know what happened.
Traveler: We saw all manner of hope and despair.
Traveler: And we'd point at the planets we wanted to visit.
Traveler: Not really. You're better than nothing, I guess.
Paimon: Hmph, okay, fine. Paimon shoulda known you weren't gonna say anything nice.
Traveler: You're easy to please.

## Talk 7

Dainsleif: Hey, time to wake up. The sun has risen.
Traveler: (...)
Traveler: (...Dain?)
Dainsleif: What a deep sleeper. You do know that we need to...
Dainsleif: Hmm? Tear stains... You dreamed of your sibling last night, didn't you?
Dainsleif: ...Alright. Rest here a bit longer then. I'll head into the forest to investigate.
Traveler: (Huh? Why're you going back into the forest...)
Traveler: *yawn*...
Traveler: (Hmm? How did I sleep till morning? Why didn't Paimon wake me up to switch shifts? ... Hang on a moment... Where IS Paimon, anyway?)
Traveler: (Ah, I vaguely remember Dain coming over. Did Paimon go into the woods with him, seeing how I hadn't woken up yet?)
Traveler: (Whatever the case, looks like it's just me here for now. Guess it's time to stretch my limbs and have a look around.)
Traveler: (Clatter...)
Traveler: (Wait, did that noise come from... inside the house?)
Traveler: Paimon, is that you?
Traveler: (No reply... I should go inside and check.)
Traveler: Paimon, this isn't the time for hide-and-seek...

## Talk 8

Dainsleif: Wait... This place, it's... familiar.
Paimon: What about it? It looks pretty normal to Paimon... Was it like this hundreds of years ago, too?
Dainsleif: Yes. The forest has barely changed from how I remember it. There is very little human activity here, after all.
Dainsleif: Let's search the area and see what we can find.
Paimon: Is this a field? It must belong to whoever owns that house over there...
Paimon: But it looks like it's been abandoned for a long time. You could be forgiven for thinking nothing was ever grown here... Or wait, maybe nothing ever WAS grown here.
Paimon: It's an extinguished bonfire. Forest Rangers, perhaps?
Paimon: Looks like it's been ages since it was last lit. And clearly they put it out carefully to prevent a forest fire, too. That's responsible.
Dainsleif: Nothing else stands out in this area. All that's left is that building. Come on.
Paimon: Wait, we're just gonna go barging in? What if someone's home?
Dainsleif: Unlikely. There are no signs of life in this area. We should be able to enter without incident.
Paimon: If you say so... Well, uh... you lead the way then, Dain. Hehe...

## Talk 9

Paimon: Doesn't look like there's anything else worth our attention here. You sure we're in the right place, Dain?
Dainsleif: My memories are quite foggy, but my subconscious and instincts both assert that something once happened here.
Dainsleif: But, we'll exhaust ourselves if we search aimlessly... I hear noises outside. Let's go and check.
Paimon: Noises? Is it...
Dainsleif: It's not much. Just some minor adversaries.
