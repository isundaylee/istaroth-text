# Neko Is a Cat: Shrine Cleanup


## Talk 1

Neko: Nya, meow... That box has proven its worth indeed...
Neko: Ah, you return. The box you repaired has proved its efficacy quite well.
Neko: Not long after your departure, two humans in green came to the shrine, meow, meow.
Neko: Not only did they offer up some Mora, but the tall, green human seemed most excited to hear me speak. How easily startled you humans are, really...
Neko: Regardless, the Offering Box is a most wondrous artifact. Perhaps repairing another shall attract yet more people?
Traveler: Uh, that's not how that works...
Neko: Is that so? Human matters are so very bothersome.
Paimon: P—Paimon thinks this has got way more to do with the state of the shrine...
Neko: And what of my shrine?
Traveler: It's a little messy...
Neko: Ho, is that so? Those little rascals quite enjoy playing amongst the piles of fallen leaves.
Neko: Ah, but if one yet recalls clearly, Hibiki used to use a long stick with pointy ends to build a pile of leaves. Now, if she did it, it must be the right thing to do.
Traveler: What do you need swept?
Neko: What would I know about the intricacies of human deeds? Still... if it were Hibiki...
Neko: Hibiki often took that stick and waved it back and forth before the sun had risen. I used to enjoy chasing that stick, yes.
Neko: But now that I am the provisional head priestess, such churlish behavior shall not do.
Neko: I remember that Hibiki would also use water on the ground... an ill thing to do, really.
Neko: Domeki would come by at times as well, and he would use crossed metal plates to go snicker-snack! And the branches and leaves would come falling down.
Traveler: Domeki?
Neko: A very tall and loud human. He and Hibiki would play together a great deal.
Neko: Hmph. That rascal always chopped off the same branches that I loved most. An infuriating fellow.
Paimon: From the sound of it, they were doing cleanup. Guess you could call it re-organization as well.
Paimon: Sweeping the floor, washing it with water, and trimming the branches...
Traveler: Such familiar work, eh...
Neko: So that was "cleanup," then? I understand. In that case, would you go forth and do as such?
Neko: Ah, yes. You may forgo the snicker-snacking. I like the branches just the way they are.
Neko: The long stick, leaves, and water will do. Have you understood my words?
Traveler: Don't you worry about it.
Neko: Meow! Yes, this work was given specifically to me by Hibiki. A vital task to be completed by no other.
Traveler: Actually, could I ask who Hibiki was?
Neko: Hibiki is Hibiki. She is the head priestess of Asase Shrine.
Traveler: And your name...
Neko: My name is Neko — a name bestowed by Hibiki.
Neko: It was she who often came out to receive guests at the shrine, and so I was not obligated to manage such affairs.
Neko: I had neither name nor title then. I slept where she wished, and played with whoever she willed.
Neko: One day, Hibiki said that she would call me "Neko," on account of my habit of sleeping.
Neko: Hibiki is presently absent, but a shrine is no shrine without a head priestess, and so I have taken up that post.
Neko: That is also why I hope to restore the shrine to its former liveliness before Hibiki returns.
Neko: ...That's right! Once she returns, I can fall asleep in her bosom, and not have to wait for her to repair the Offering Box, or wait for her to use that long stick of hers to clear the leaves.
Neko: Well, I shall leave those tasks to you. There are some sneaky bugs that have stolen into the shrine, and they must now be driven out.
Traveler: Snicker-snack?
Paimon: Neko probably means trimming the branches.
Traveler: What exactly do you need done?
Traveler: It could use some cleanup...

## Talk 2

Neko: Is your "cleanup" complete?
Traveler: Everything's spick and span.
Neko: Meow, meow. That is good. I have also chased those little crawlies away.
Neko: Why, this shrine is looking more and more the part. The box is repaired, and the shrine itself is clean... Yes, more people shall surely come to pay their respects.
Neko: Meow, meow... We must return this shrine to its former glory, yes... Meow...
Neko: We shall stop here. Thank you for your help thus far... meow, meow...
Neko: Speaking your language is... so tiring...
Neko: I am going to rest. Perhaps your aid shall be required later also...
Neko: When that time comes, do return here to... meow, meow...

## Talk 3

Neko: Meow! Yes, this work was given specifically to me by Hibiki. A vital task to be completed by no other.
Traveler: So, about your name...
Neko: My name is Neko — a name bestowed by Hibiki.
Neko: It was she who often came out to receive guests at the shrine, and so I was not obligated to manage such affairs.
Neko: I had neither name nor title then. I slept where she wished, and played with whomever she willed.
Neko: One day, Hibiki said that she would call me "Neko," on account of my habit of sleeping.
Neko: Hibiki is presently absent, but a shrine is no shrine without a head priestess, and so I have taken up that post.
Neko: That is also why I hope to restore the shrine to its former liveliness before Hibiki returns.
Neko: Once she returns, I can fall asleep in her bosom, and not have to wait for her to repair the Offering Box, or for her to use that long stick of hers to clear the fallen leaves.
Neko: Well, I shall leave those tasks to you. There are some sneaky bugs that have stolen into the shrine, and they must now be driven out.
Traveler: So, who used to tidy the shrine?
Neko: It was Hibiki. Domeki would help her sometimes, too.
Neko: Hibiki often took that stick and waved it back and forth before sunrise. She would also pour water on the ground. Ugh, water...
Neko: Wait. Did she pour the water first? I do not quite recall the sequence of events...
Neko: Domeki would come by at times as well, and he would use crossed metal plates to go snicker-snack! And the branches and leaves would come falling down.

## Talk 4

Neko: We must... return this shrine to its former glory, yes... Meow...
Neko: When will Hibiki... finally return... meow...
