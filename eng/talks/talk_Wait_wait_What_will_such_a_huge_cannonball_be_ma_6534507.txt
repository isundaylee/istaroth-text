Traveler: Wait, wait! What will such a huge cannonball be made of?
Babisse: Hmmm, well, this is exactly the problem I meant to solve.
Babisse: I've prepared several experimental material types, and I plan to use each to make a projectile, each with small animals as... passengers.
Babisse: *sigh* Speaking of which, I must thank that gentleman for his "high-speed aquabus" idea. It's given me tons of inspiration.
Babisse: It's not exactly the same sort of "speed" as the cannonball's, of course, but there are still design ideas here that I can gainfully refer to.
