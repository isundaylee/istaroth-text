Traveler: A route towards the south?
Foscari: That's right. As long as you follow the aqueducts newly built by our God King, a ship can sail beneath the high sea and reach the desert to the south.
Foscari: The previous trade route followed the northern border and was susceptible to barbarian harassment, the best efforts of our patrolling troops notwithstanding.
Foscari: Ah, by the great Golden Symphony! With the new aqueduct, commercial activity is at last secure! This, surely, is a manifestation of our God King's boundless grace.
