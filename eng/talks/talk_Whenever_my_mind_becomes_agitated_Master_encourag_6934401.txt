# Talk Dialog

Shenhe: Whenever my mind becomes agitated, Master encourages me to sit, meditate, and let go of all troubling thoughts.
Shenhe: If I lose touch with the real me inside, all that's left is the urge to slay, which makes me a risk to everyone around me...
Shenhe: I do not wish to see that happen.
