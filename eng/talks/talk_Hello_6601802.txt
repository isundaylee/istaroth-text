Traveler: Hello.
Askia: Hello, have you come to see the Sacred Flame too?
Askia: Like an apple that hangs from the treetop, it is the very first flame to be won after victory in battle... It is also the final flame with which all corruption shall be incinerated...
Askia: The Stele of the Sacred Flame was a blessing bestowed on Natlan by the heavens. Come, friend, pray with me.
Askia: May the Sacred Flame never fall; may the fruits of victory forever endure.
