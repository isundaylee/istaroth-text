Traveler: Who are you...
Erfan: I am the one who walks under the veil of night, a listener of drunkards' most honest confessions...
Erfan: Hahaha, just kiddin'! I'm just a bartender working night shifts here.
Erfan: Many come here to drink at night. Some of them might get quite drunk. So Lambad had me take some of Qishan's shifts.
Erfan: An Akademiya student during the day and a bartender at night. I'd say I've managed to keep a good work-study balance.
