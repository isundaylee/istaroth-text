# When All Becomes a Monument


## Talk 1

Black Screen Text: Your friends cheer for your return as the people of Natlan celebrate your victory.
Black Screen Text: In the interest of safety, you allow a doctor to check for signs of Abyssal corrosion.
Louqua: Unbelievable... No signs of Abyssal corruption whatsoever. The same goes for the Pyro Archon.
Louqua: In that case, just get some rest, and enjoy your victory.
Paimon: That means... There's officially nothing to worry about!
Paimon: You won, hahahaha! You actually won!
Traveler: Finally, it's time to relax.
Paimon: Paimon knew you could do it! The Abyss is no match for you!
Iansan: #You did it again, Traveler. Your strength is remarkable!
Iansan: And now, Natlan is finally free from the threat of the Abyss!
Mualani: Welcome back, great hero... I can't wait to tell your story to everyone!
Ororon: We should record it on a woven scroll, too. That way, your story will be preserved in my tribe for generations to come.
Ororon: I'm sure the Grannies and Gramps back home are already on it.
Chasca: #Amazing job, Traveler. Becoming the first outlander with an ancient name definitely makes you a legend.
Xilonen: The Lord of the Night was right to place her trust in you. She chose the perfect name.
Kachina: Th—The most important thing is that you made it back safe! Now, I don't have to worry about the rescue plan!
Paimon: You came up with a rescue plan?
Kachina: #W—Well, Traveler already saved me once. So, yeah... If things got risky down there, I was gonna charge in and rescue him!
Iansan: I don't think it would be quite so simple, Kachina. But, still...
Iansan: If something like that really did happen, I'd come for you, too, no matter what it took.
Mualani: Couldn't have said it better myself!
Kinich: Bravery aside, I try not to act on impulse... But, I suppose there's an exception to every rule.
Traveler: Before you praise me too much...
Traveler: In the Ley Lines, I encountered many souls of the dead, and I could hear everyone rooting for me from above.
Paimon: Wait, really? Who did you see?
Traveler: I saw Atea, Vichama, Chuychu, and all six heroes from five hundred years ago... Not to mention, I heard the messages you left for me in my ancient name.
Traveler: I have to thank each and every one of you.
Traveler: Without your help, I could never have defeated an enemy as strong as the Abyss.
Ororon: So, you heard everything we said...
Xilonen: Those messages became part of your name during the forging process. I just didn't expect them to come in handy at such a crucial moment...
Iansan: To think that you heard them, though... Th—That's a little embarrassing...
Mualani: Hey, what's embarrassing about that? I'll say it again right now!
Mualani: Being your friend makes me so happy! Hehehe~
Chasca: ...Heh, good one, Chuychu.
Mavuika: #Things are looking lively over here. How are you feeling, Traveler?
Traveler: I feel completely fine.
Mavuika: Great, just what I wanted to hear.
Mavuika: The preparations for your celebration ceremony are almost complete.
Paimon: Celebration ceremony?
Mavuika: According to tradition, we hold a celebration ceremony for our most outstanding warriors after their final Pilgrimage.
Mavuika: In most cases, "outstanding" means warriors who earned more than twenty victories in the Night Warden Wars.
Mavuika: It's an exceedingly rare honor. You can think of it almost like a lifetime achievement award.
Ororon: We haven't held one of those ceremonies in a long time, though...
Mavuika: #True, but given Traveler's exceptional contribution to this victory, I think he is more than worthy of the honor.
Mavuika: Let's head to the center of the Stadium, and I'll announce the honor to everyone. You deserve a formal round of applause for this achievement.
Mualani: Oooh, then I'm gonna grab the best seat in the house!
Kachina: Wait, I—I'm coming, too!
Iansan: Kamera... This calls for a Kamera...
Paimon: Haha, slow down! There's no rush!
Paimon: Mavuika, if this ceremony is to celebrate defeating the Abyss, don't you deserve the same honor?
Mavuika: What's the point of holding a victory feast for yourself? Besides, I'm already the Pyro Archon — that's enough honor for a lifetime.
Mavuika: Let's go. Everyone's waiting for us.
Traveler: I have something to say.
Traveler: Finally, someone to speak for me.
Paimon: Is that all Paimon is to you...? You know what? Never mind. You get a free pass on all Paimon-teasing today!

## Talk 2

Mavuika: Today, Natlan's long struggle against the Abyss has met its end.
Mavuika: Many fought for this day and gave their lives for this cause — we must not forget them, or the heroic outlander who lent us their aid.
Mavuika: #His ancient name, "Tum{RUBY#[D]Hope}aini," will be immortalized in the history of Natlan.
Mavuika: From this point on, there will be no more Night Warden Wars, and I pray the Ode of Resurrection will never again need to bring back the fallen.
Mavuika: We fought for a singular purpose — peace. And now, it has been achieved.
Mavuika: #The funeral to commemorate the fallen will be held on a later day. In the meantime, our hero will embark on a parade of blessings. Let us send him off with a round of applause.
Mavuika: #And show him the warmth and gratitude of our people!
Crowd: Wohoooooo!
Mavuika: Go on, this is your moment. You should savor it.
Traveler: But... what about you?
Mavuika: Now that the threat of the Abyss has been eliminated, we finally have a chance to restore the Night Kingdom.
Mavuika: I'll take care of that first.
Paimon: Okay! We'll look forward to good news!

## Talk 3

Pacal: Just a moment, great hero. Before you set out on the parade of blessings, please accept these feathered accessories.
Wayna: We bestow these gifts to every hero who receives this honor. They are proof of your bravery and strength and mark you as a role model for all in Natlan.
Amina: Thank you for everything... Thank you for saving us from the Abyss!
Mutota: Now, the person who has the honor of adorning you with these gifts is none other than one of Natlan's most outstanding warriors, Chasca!
Paimon: Oh, it's just someone we know.
Chasca: You sound disappointed.
Traveler: By "someone we know," Paimon meant "a cherished comrade."
Paimon: Exactly! It, uh... makes this moment even more special because we're already friends!
Chasca: Well... Both in a personal capacity and as a representative of all warriors in Natlan, I bestow upon you this blessing.
Chasca: May your flame forever burn pure and bright.
Acatl: With us by your side, you'll never fight alone!
Biram: Time to embark on your parade of blessings.

## Talk 16

Paimon: Man, this place really is hard to get to... And, um, Paimon wasn't the only one who saw that weird... thing up there, right?
Paimon: All those... eyes inside of it... Talk about creepy!
Citlali: I believe that's how the Ruler of Death keeps an eye on Teyvat...
Citlali: Quick, this way. We're almost there.

## Talk 17

Yata: Story! Story! I wanna hear a story!
Cucuya: C'mon! Tell us! Tell us!
Sadigua: Well, you kids don't miss a beat, do you?
Sadigua: Alright, you can be the first audience for this new tale. Let me know what you think.
Sadigua: Now, where to begin...
Paimon: Wanna stop and listen to the story? Sounds pretty fun!
Traveler: Sure.
Sadigua: This is a story of the great heroes of our time.
Sadigua: There are three great heroes at the center of this tale.
Sadigua: #The first is an outlander known as "Traveler."
Sadigua: A warrior of great strength, completely immune to the power of the Abyss.
Sadigua: #Most importantly, Traveler is kind and brave, someone who treasures those around him. You could call him a natural-born hero!
Soncco: #Yeah, {F#s}he's super strong! Tell us more!
Ayun: Hey, just let him finish the story!
Paimon: #The man telling the story keeps looking this way, Traveler. Paimon thinks he recognizes you...
Traveler: Well, we've really made a name ourselves in Natlan.
Sadigua: The second hero is also an outlander.
Sadigua: Many years ago, he forged a connection with this land and used his body as a vessel for the souls of his fallen comrades.
Sadigua: His goal was to give them a home and, with that, a chance to be reborn into this world.
Sadigua: The third hero is none other than our current Archon, Mavuika!
Sadigua: Not only is she a powerful and respected figure, but she also commands the power of the Ode of Resurrection, which can bring people back from the dead.
Sadigua: With the support of six heroes from five hundred years ago, she united Natlan against a dangerous foe.
Sadigua: #Now, this story truly begins with the arrival of Traveler in Natlan...
Sadigua: #...Under his guidance, Kachina performed exceptionally well in the Pilgrimage, and earned her chance at the Night Warden Wars...
Sadigua: ...Suddenly, the sky turned dark, the Sacred Flame went out, and Gosoythoth appeared...
Sadigua: ...Everyone gathered at the Stadium and sang the Ode of Resurrection together to send their support to the furthest corner of the Night Kingdom...
Sadigua: "Tum{RUBY#[D]Hope}aini" became known by all, and everyone began reciting the words that defined its message.
Sadigua: "In the beginning, there was darkness."
Sadigua: "Until someone set themselves aflame."
Sadigua: "Only then did the universe know light."
Sadigua: Anyway, the dust has now settled, and Natlan has entered a new era of peace.
Sadigua: #Traveler fought for "life." The Captain fought for "death."
Sadigua: And our Archon, Mavuika, created a bridge between them.
Yata: Wow!
Cucuya: Is there more? Please don't let that be the end!
Sadigua: Sounds like you like this one... Tell you what, give me some time, and I'll write it all out in even greater detail.
Matho: I loved it! This is the best story ever!
Soncco: Yeah! And "Tum{RUBY#[D]Hope}aini" is the coolest ancient name! I get to be "Tumaini" today, okay guys?
Ayun: Hey, it's supposed to be my turn!
Cucuya: No! It's my turn!
Yata: No, it's MY turn! I get to be "Tum{RUBY#[D]Hope}aini" today!
Matho: So, no one wants to be the Pyro Archon anymore?
Paimon: #Hehe, sounds fun. What do you say, Traveler? Wanna let Paimon be "Tum{RUBY#[D]Hope}aini" for the day?
Traveler: Sure! Then, I'll be Paimon.
Paimon: Alrighty then! Let's go, Paimon. A new adventure awaits!
Traveler: Listening to all this is a little embarrassing, though...

Ajaw: Strange... Why does no one praise the deeds of the Almighty Dragonlord, K'uhul Ajaw?
Ajaw: Does no one care about my heroism? A great hero such as myself, forced to remain nameless. Hmph, ignorant fools...
Kinich: Fine, I guess you helped out. Good job.
Ajaw: Well, well, well... A compliment! After all these years! It's about time you knew your place, lowly servant.
Ajaw: Hey! Why are you glaring at me? Oof—

### Additional Talk 9

Xilonen: The stories of heroes will continue to be passed down from generation to generation.
Xilonen: If Natlan faces a crisis again, I'm sure people will look to our story as a source of hope.
Xilonen: We've earned our place in history... That's pretty surreal, don't you think?

### Additional Talk 10

Iansan: Muscles grow stronger through periods of strain, and people work the same way.
Iansan: Even though the crisis is over, we will still band together for the sake of a new future!
Iansan: Oh, and you should really come to the Collective of Plenty sometime. Especially you, Paimon — your nutrition plan is already set!
Paimon: Okay... Um, so you can help Paimon get stronger, right?
Paimon: #If something like this happens again, Paimon wants to fight by Traveler's side!
Iansan: Haha, of course! You've got serious potential!

### Additional Talk 11

Chasca: After you got back, you mentioned that you saw Chuychu in the Night Kingdom... So, she helped you, then?
Traveler: Yeah, she brought a lot of Saurians.
Chasca: Good. I'm sure that made her happy.
Chasca: ...
Traveler: There's still time.
Chasca: It's alright. I don't think she's going to come see me.
Chasca: She's probably sick of nagging her older sister.
Chasca: Still, thank you for telling me. Natlan has a bright future because of you, and I have a chance to make up for my regrets.
Traveler: To see her in your dreams.
Traveler: And helped get through a tricky part of the Night Kingdom.

### Additional Talk 12

Chimalli: Just like the Archon said — we can now proudly tell our children that this war is a thing of the past. It's a new chapter for all of us.
Chimalli: We will never forget your contribution, and Natlan will always be with you. May the Sacred Flame protect you in all the journeys to come.

### Additional Talk 13

Luta: When I was little, my father told me about Thrain, the "Sentinel Knight," an outlander who once fought alongside the warriors of Natlan.
Luta: He was brave, fearless, and deeply respected by his men. I always wished I could go back in time and see him in action...
Luta: I never thought that, in my lifetime, another outlander would fight to save this land, or that I would get the chance to fight by their side. I will treasure this honor for the rest of my life.

### Additional Talk 14

Huamanga: I knew about The Captain's immense strength, but I never expected him to have a such a strong sense of honor.
Huamanga: No matter how prejudiced I may have been in the past, he now has my utmost respect.

### Additional Talk 15

Mavuika: Ah, our hero is here! Is there something you want to discuss?
Traveler: About the stances of the Heavenly Principles and the Shades...
Mavuika: The forces of the Abyss have always sought to corrode Teyvat. The Ley Lines were created by the Heavenly Principles, and it is only with their protection that Teyvat is able to nurture all forms of life.
Mavuika: If the Abyss had free reign, this world would become a living hell. We saw that for ourselves...
Mavuika: Any attempt by humanity to harness the power of the Abyss is met with swift punishment. The Heavenly Principles and the Shades show no mercy in that regard.
Mavuika: That unyielding approach is also the source of great sorrow and hatred... The situation goes beyond a simple discussion of "right" versus "wrong."
Mavuika: Perhaps the truth will reveal itself during your future adventures.
Mavuika: The long journey of the Pyro Archon has now come to an end. Together, we overcame darkness and death to accomplish something truly remarkable.
Mavuika: As we celebrate your glory, allow me thank you once again — this time, just as "Mavuika."
Mavuika: Thank you for the respect, understanding, and support every step of the way.
Traveler: It was my honor.
Mavuika: An honor we share.
Mavuika: You can keep chatting with your friends nearby. I think I'll stay here for now... and watch over them.
Traveler: About the Ode of Resurrection somehow taking effect before victory...
Mavuika: Oh, isn't it obvious?
Mavuika: The Ode of Resurrection didn't take effect at all.
Mavuika: Your own strength is what allowed you to keep fighting, as well as the moral support from everyone in Natlan.
Mavuika: Still, "moral support" is also an important, if under appreciated, effect of the Ode of Resurrection.
Traveler: About Natlan's Gnosis...
Mavuika: The Captain's subordinates sent us a letter he left behind. After our duel at the Stadium, he asked the Tsaritsa to remove him from the responsibility of obtaining the Gnosis, and his request was granted.
Mavuika: The Captain respected the outcome of that match and refused to violate his principles. But, since this is the final Gnosis, I doubt the Tsaritsa will let the situation stand.
Mavuika: Perhaps a replacement Harbinger will be sent here soon. I'll make sure to be prepared.
Traveler: About the next stop on my journey...
Mavuika: A direct conflict with the Fatui is unavoidable the moment you step foot in Snezhnaya.
Mavuika: So, make sure you're ready for any scenario. On a related note, I've acquired some new intel about the fragment that suddenly appeared in the sky.
Mavuika: Such fragments are known as "Ancient Moon's Remnants," relics of Secret Source technology from the era of the Ancient Dragons. Coincidentally, a small squad of Fatui infiltrated our borders around the same time it appeared.
Mavuika: Our investigation revealed them to be subordinates of The Doctor. Their stronghold is in Nod-Krai, a land with a long history not far from Snezhnaya.
Mavuika: The people there can use a very special power. It is said that this mysterious power predates even the seven elements of Teyvat.
Mavuika: Ancient Moon's Remnants, The Doctor, a mysterious power... The project that connects all three must be ambitious indeed.
Traveler: About the tribe my ancient name will belong to...
Mavuika: Tribe? Oh, you're thinking along the lines of how the names of the six heroes were inherited...
Mavuika: In truth, apart from a few ancient names associated with a certain tribal culture or tradition, most ancient names can be inherited by anyone.
Mavuika: Your name likely falls under that category. The Wayob will select someone who shares your character and name them as your successor.
Mavuika: Of course, that won't happen for a very long time.
Traveler: I don't have any other questions...

### Additional Talk 16

Mavuika: To my sister, Hine.
Mavuika: I know all that remains in the Night Kingdom is your memory, but I still wanted to write a short letter to tell you about the situation after the war.
Mavuika: After countless partings and farewells, Natlan has finally entered an era of peace.
Mavuika: The Pilgrimage is still a popular tournament, but now, its only purpose is to showcase the thrill of competition rather than select warriors for war.
Mavuika: Our cultural legacy is not rooted in our suffering. In this era of peace, Natlan's fire will burn brighter than ever.
Mavuika: With the restoration of the Night Kingdom, our people are now free to leave our borders, and many have set their sights on the wonders of Teyvat.
Mavuika: I'm sure many exciting and eye-opening adventures await them.
Mavuika: And although our battle scars will fade, the stories of our heroes will never be forgotten.
Mavuika: When a new you returns to this land one day, I know you'll recognize the significance of this war and all we lost.
Mavuika: The land we love has not been destroyed, but grows stronger by the day.
Mavuika: I will forever be grateful that I got to see you again.
Mavuika: And when the flames deliver this letter to you, I hope you know how much I miss you.
Mavuika: Huh, I actually got the chance to finish this painting.
Mavuika: And not a moment too soon. It's time to bid farewell to all the fallen.

### Additional Talk 17

Rotchev: My lord, you will forever serve as an example for all your soldiers.

### Additional Talk 18

Paimon: #What are you thinking about, Traveler?
Paimon: Oh, the battle, right? Even though we won in the end, it cost a lot to get to this point, huh...
Salute (Monument): "Sing your final song with pride, like a hero's march to the other side."
Salute (Monument): "This monument commemorates the {ABYSSWAR#1003} brave warriors who gave their lives in the War for Natlan."
Traveler: ...
Traveler: Let's leave this for them.
