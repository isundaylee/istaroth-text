Traveler: Who are you?
Watanabe: I'm a Doushin in charge of recruit training here. You can call me Instructor Watanabe.
Watanabe: I've got to say that the recruits nowadays lack perseverance and patience. How will they serve the Shogun like that?
Watanabe: Eh... why am I telling you this stuff? No outsiders are allowed on the drill grounds!
