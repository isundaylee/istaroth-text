Traveler: Let's hear about the symphony and "Phobos"...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Where should I even begin... The "Symphony" is human memory and persona woven into a melody through musical notation, creating a song in which human souls can dwell and have their wishes fulfilled.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): In that way, to master the "Symphony" is to master "fate"... This is the secret that the Great Golden Bee Sybilla, the prophet who survived the previous cycle, imparted.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): The Sebastos, who created the "Symphony," poured these melodies into the insoluble Ichor, in hopes that all might control their own fates through playing that music.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): He overestimated us, I fear, for his deeds terrified us... The people could not bear the burden of fate, and they begged their god and superiors for guidance.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): At the request of the people, the Sebastos wrote all melodies into the grandest of melodies. This new Symphony would bring us all the greatest of happiness — and its name was "Phobos."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Had the Sebastos's plan worked, the Symphony would have woven a melody of utmost gentleness for us all — an eternity that would last a thousand years and beyond. But something went wrong...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Besides the Sebastos himself, only said superiors, the Harmosts, could have changed Phobos's melody.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): And Boethius... was once an excellent Harmost.
