Traveler: Could it be resold to the Knights of Favonius?
Bernhard: This is indeed a method, and sometimes, the Knights will spontaneously count their personal needs.
Bernhard: If residents have used goods that they are willing to sell, and the knights do not mind, they can make a deal directly to reduce the waste of materials.
Bernhard: In the same way, the inhabitants could speak directly to the knights if they need something.
Bernhard: Maybe someone recently wanted to buy something, but didn't realize that these owners had a lot of stuff they couldn't sell.
Paimon: Alright! Well, it's up to you to bridge the gap, Bernhard.
Black Screen Text: Bernhard leaves for the Order to look at the purchase needs...
Bernhard: Honorary Knight. Paimon. Good news!
Bernhard: It just so happens that a lot of people want to buy used goods these days, and they can resell most of the surplus goods to them.
Bernhard: Some of the knights also chipped in to pay for our hard work.
Paimon: Okay! The thrift crisis is solved, and everyone's needs are met!
