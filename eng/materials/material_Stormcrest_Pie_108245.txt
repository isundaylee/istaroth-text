# Stormcrest Pie

Eula's specialty. It's hard to say if the unorthodox, non-full-moon shape is meant to flout tradition or express her "tooth for a tooth" ethos. A rich, savory, and smoky flavor emanates from beneath the golden outer crust, unlikely to be reproducible by anybody else in Mondstadt. Best not to tell her all this, though, lest she add it to her list of personal vendettas.
