# Involuntary Sacrifice


## Talk 1

Paimon: What is this power...? Paimon's never seen it before...
Paimon: Careful! Please don't get cocky...!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Th—This looks like a person!
Paimon: Could it be the Grand Thief?
Paimon: Why is he in that position? Is he praying to something?
Paimon: !?
Paimon: That's...
Traveler: A... Statue of The Seven?
Paimon: Wh—Why is this Statue of The Seven... hanging upside-down...?
Paimon: And the statue's hands... Paimon remembers they are normally holding an orb, right?
Paimon: But, this statue is holding... What is that?
Paimon: Uhh... Paimon has a really bad feeling about this...
Paimon: And the Grand Thief hasn't moved an inch. D—Do you think he's...?
Paimon: Um... hello...? Are you okay mister?
Observe the "Grand Thief": (There's no reaction, nor any sign of breathing.)
Paimon: ...H—He's dead.
Paimon: #Paimon doesn't feel so good, Traveler.
Traveler: What a terrible place...
Paimon: Let's get out of here, and fast! We should report back to Ganyu and Lan...
Paimon: Aaah! Now what!?
Traveler: How did he die...?
Traveler: Some strange thing that I've never seen...

## Talk 3

Abyss Herald: This power... It seems familiar...
Abyss Herald: Hmph...!
Abyss Herald: I see... So, it's you... you are the one!
Abyss Herald: In that case, I shall stay here no longer...
Paimon: #Whew... What a tough battle. Are you okay, Traveler?
Paimon: Such a strong enemy. Who knew the Abyss Order had monsters this powerful among them?
Traveler: (It seemed to... know me.)
Paimon: Huh? What is it? What are you thinking about?
Traveler: Nothing, let's just get out of here.
Paimon: Oh, right, yeah... We're near the exit now. Let's get outta this scary place before something even more dangerous shows up!

## Talk 4

Abyss Herald (???): You cannot spy on the secrets of the Abyss.
Abyss Herald (???): You have come here, you have seen our secrets. For this, you must pay the price.
Abyss Herald: As a Herald, I will mete out your punishment.
Paimon: An Abyss Herald!?
Traveler: The one Dain spoke of...
Abyss Herald: Dain... Dainsleif? Oh, I thought you were just a couple of pests that stumbled in here by mistake... So, you are with Dainsleif, that constant annoyance in our affairs...
Abyss Herald: Did he send you here to die? His resistance against the Abyss has gone nowhere for a long time. There is nothing you can do to change the tide...
Abyss Herald: The Abyss... is unstoppable!
Traveler: The monster we were tracking with Dain...
