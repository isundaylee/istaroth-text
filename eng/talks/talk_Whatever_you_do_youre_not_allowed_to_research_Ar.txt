Traveler: Whatever you do, you're not allowed to research Arkhium!
Edwin Eastinghouse: Ugh, why are you here? Don't you understand? That explosion before was just an accident. Arkhium still has plenty of potential as a subject of research.
Edwin Eastinghouse: And such incidents are inevitable during research. You lose a few researchers? Hire a few more. You destroy a lab? Build another. As long as the supply of Arkhium is guaranteed, I can get the research project up and running again.
Edwin Eastinghouse: ...Why are you looking at me like that? Did I say something wrong?
