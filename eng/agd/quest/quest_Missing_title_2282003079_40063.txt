## Talk 1

Karpillia: We've also taken up some of the setup work for this Irodori Festival here at Sailing Breeze.
Karpillia: Not only that, we've also gotten ourselves a collaboration with the light novel "Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?". We'll be selling a limited number of collaborative drinks every day!
Karpillia: The drink has some products from Mondstadt in it and tastes very unique as a result. Do come and give it a go.

## Talk 2

Tingting: Have you finished reading the fan novel that we bought together?
Sasano: Yup, more or less...
Tingting: Wasn't it great? I loved the ending, the way in which the female lead chose to stride towards her new life, convictions in hand!
Sasano: You know, although the plotline at the start was very exciting, I remember that this wasn't the original ending...
Tingting: *sigh* I guess that's the freedom of fan works for you.
Tingting: Getting to see all sorts of characters' stories in fan works is exactly their charm.
Sasano: ...That's true, that's true. You've got a point there...
Sasano: Also, I've heard that a new picture book's come out over there. Wanna go have a look?

## Talk 3

Kageyama: Welcome to the Magnificent Irodori Festival.
Kageyama: If you are here as an invited guest, please display your Invitation Letter, and one of our staff will help you arrange your event itinerary during this time.
Kageyama: If you are just here as a visitor, please enjoy the festival. If you have any questions, please direct them here.

## Talk 4

Ebina Gonshirou: What is it? Something I can help you with?
Ebina Gonshirou: The festival might be a good time, but let me just say this first: don't you make any trouble for Ms. Kageyama!

## Talk 5

Ryouko: Welcome. Are you here in Ritou to take part in the Magnificent Irodori Festival?
Ryouko: The festival is very lively indeed, so please enjoy yourself, and don't forget to fill your stomach!
Ryouko: There are tons of queues and tons of things to queue up for, but if you don't eat, you might find yourself growing faint, especially under the hot sun.
Ryouko: During those times, feel free to come here to replenish your energy, hehe.

## Talk 6

Qiuyue: People have been asking me lately if I know where to find Mr. Zhenyu from Liyue, but I've never heard of this person in my life.
Qiuyue: Is he some kind of superstar, even more well-known than the Qixing somehow?
Qiuyue: Ah, sorry for the wait, dear customer. Would you like some ores from Liyue?

## Talk 7

Kaede: I never thought that Ritou would play host to a festival by the Yae Publishing House, nor that this many people would show up.
Kaede: Thanks to the Irodori Festival, our Inazuman products and toys have been very popular indeed, even those that aren't necessarily part of our event-specific promotions.
