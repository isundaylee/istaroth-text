Izad: I heard from some students passing by that some ores appeared in a place nearby. They were so absorbed in discussing a problem that they didn't watch where they were going and tripped over some Magical Crystal Ores.
Izad: I could help clean them up if I had my tools with me... I can tell you the location if you want to check it out.
Izad: Ores are pretty useful. You need them too, right?
