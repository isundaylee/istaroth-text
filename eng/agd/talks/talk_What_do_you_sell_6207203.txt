Traveler: What do you sell?
Ivanovich: Technically I am a distributor, selling everyday items produced in Snezhnaya. As well as that, I also act as an agent for Cor Lapis merchants selling to Snezhnayan factories.
Ivanovich: The Qixing have been keeping a close eye on Snezhnaya's senior officials recently...
Ivanovich: Some people say that the only reason we are able to buy Cor Lapis from Liyue merchants is because they were mediating behind the scenes...
Ivanovich: But I am not privy to the details. So please excuse me from withholding judgment.
Ivanovich: Although our goods are produced in high quantities, they are by no means cheap.
Ivanovich: So I have a high opinion of Liyue consumers... Their spending always exceeds our projections.
