### Additional Talk 1

Listen to the Next Breakdown: Hello, all. I am Iron Tongue Tian, here with an official signboard for the Arataki Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp. It also doubles as your permit to run the event.
Paimon: Whoa! Is this supposed to be... Bull-Chucker and Crimson Staff? It's so over the top!
Arataki Itto: Oh, sweet! Sadly, it's not my own original artwork... But check out that design! And that linework!
Arataki Itto: It's so cool! It's epic! It captures exactly how awesome I look as a pro beetle-fighter in the heat of battle!
Arataki Itto: Dude! ...Wait, not that — how do they usually address strangers in this part of the world?
Grandmaster Hanakado: Maybe... "esquire"?
Arataki Itto: That's the one! Tian Esquire, your artwork is incredible! Words cannot express the Arataki Gang's gratitude!
Listen to the Next Breakdown: You can drop the "esquire," Don Arataki. Also, I'm no artist — just a storyteller.
Listen to the Next Breakdown: This promotional artwork was done by a young lady at the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Yanfei looks out for her a lot, so when she heard about your event, she offered to contribute some artwork.
Arataki Itto: Ohh, so this is Yanfei's doing! Man, she really thought of everything... This is exactly what we needed!
Listen to the Next Breakdown: Young Grandmaster Hanakado here tells me that your boot camp is an ambitious training program that could shape the future of beetle-fighting.
Listen to the Next Breakdown: I'm no beetle-fighter myself, but I've heard a lot about it, and have always wanted to try it out for myself.
Listen to the Next Breakdown: Who knows — it might just give me the inspiration for a great new story to tell in the neighborhood.
Grandmaster Hanakado: Beetle fighting is something you have to have a natural affinity for. Take Skycleaving White-Iron Lavender Melon for instance: She battled with great prowess on her first time after only a short demonstration.
Grandmaster Hanakado: Once Tian Esquire has grasped the basics of beetle-fighting and understands the appeal, we might get a lot of free publicity from his storytelling.
Arataki Itto: Dude! That would be awesome!
Arataki Itto: Alright, Squirt! Squat! Squire! ESQUIRE! Ahehehehehem... Uh... m—may the best man win!

Listen to the Next Breakdown: Wonderful!
Listen to the Next Breakdown: I can see that the Arataki Gang has transformed beetle fighting into a fiercely competitive high-adrenaline sport. Yes, there are the rudiments of a fine tale here, to be told time and again.
Arataki Itto: Great dueling with you, Tian Esquire! The pleasure was alllllright!
Grandmaster Hanakado: The phrase is "the pleasure was all mine," Oni King.
Arataki Itto: Ah, details, schmetails! Point is... Thank you for supporting our boot camp!
Listen to the Next Breakdown: I extend my gratitude to you too, Don Arataki. I intend to stay here and watch a while longer to further enrich my writing. Please, pay no regard — just pretend I'm not here.
Arataki Itto: Man, I've never fought against someone so... cultured before! My mind's buzzing from all those fancy words. What's that buzzy feeling called again? Oh yeah — learning!
Arataki Itto: Looks like the Arataki Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp is getting off to a good start!
