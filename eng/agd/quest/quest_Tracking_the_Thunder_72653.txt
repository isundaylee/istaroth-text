# Tracking the Thunder


## Talk 1

Muzhen: Traveler, you've returned!
Muzhen: I had a look at the crystals you brought back earlier. They seem rather... "young."
Muzhen: By that, I mean that they come from rather recent elemental crystallizations... To strike a comparison, this is but a slightly deeper footprint recently left in the snow.
Muzhen: So this time, I'd like you to look for footprints that are more "shallow"... and follow them to their source!
Muzhen: When I say "shallow footprints," I mean deposits of Electro elements that have condensed to a certain extent near the ground.
Muzhen: If we are able to obtain sufficient samples of that for comparison, we should be able to draw a general route map.
Paimon: Shallow and deep footprints... route maps... Paimon's got no idea what you're on about.
Traveler: It is rather complicated...
Muzhen: Well, maybe my analogy wasn't the best, but I think you'll figure it out just fine once you're there!
Muzhen: Well, guess that's all for the chit-chat. Time to get moving!

## Talk 2

Muzhen: At this point, we've got enough to determine the general area in which these Ruin machines are located. But we still can't pinpoint their precise location.
Traveler: How's the view from the shore?
Muzhen: You mean from here? Well, it's certainly wider than it was below deck. It's not bad.
Muzhen: Still, I'm not very fond of the air here. It's just missing that little "something" that I usually have below deck. I swear it's making my brain work slower.
Muzhen: The shore's good for a view, but not great for thinking.
Muzhen: Which is why I'm just wringing my hands over here. Guess the rest is up to you!
Paimon: Gee, this lady couldn't beg and plead to save her life!
Muzhen: Hehe~
Traveler: How's your research coming along?
Muzhen: Not great. Well, I'm stuck, to be honest.
