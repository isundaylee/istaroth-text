Traveler: Is injury likely?
Yawar: Usually, it'd just be some small scratches.
Yawar: The ones who get seriously hurt around here are those who are into serious challenges and extreme sports.
Yawar: Oh, and just between the two of us, if you ever find someone seriously injured but without the help of a doctor, please feel free to bring them to me.
Yawar: I actually know some first aid techniques, but please don't tell anyone else about it!
Yawar: If those crazy kids ever hear that I'd be able to save them, they'll just feel compelled to try even more dangerous tricks.
