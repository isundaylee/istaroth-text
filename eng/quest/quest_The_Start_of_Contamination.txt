# The Start of Contamination


## Talk 1

Katheryne: Traveler, you've come at a good time.
Paimon: Wait, this sounds like... another commission?
Katheryne: Hehe, it is as you say. The commission this time around is of high importance. It pertains to the safety of the Avidya Forest's inhabitants.
Paimon: Huh? What happened?
Katheryne: Not long ago, we received word that a section of the Avidya Forest seems to have become "contaminated."
Paimon: Contaminated? You mean... a new Withering Zone?
Katheryne: I don't know about the specifics, but I hear that strange things are happening to people who cross through that region.
Katheryne: The Avidya Forest's inhabitants won't leave their home so easily. If we allow this contaminated region to expand, the consequences could be unimaginable.
Katheryne: That's why I want to ask you to investigate the situation. Even if all you can do is stop the contamination from spreading, that will still save many people.
Paimon: This is forest business... Hmm, maybe Tighnari will know something. Let's go find him!

## Talk 2

Paimon: This is where you've been, Tighnari! Hm? That's—
Tighnari: Shh... Keep your voice down.
Yara: Tighnari... Everything's spinning...
Yara: Am I going to die? *sniff* Tell Mom that I should've listened to her...
Yara: And tell Suna that I'm sorry for breaking her toy. I didn't tell her because I was scared that she wouldn't play with me anymore...
Yara: Tighnari, I heard that people turn into birds after they die. Is that true? I feel like I'm getting lighter...
Paimon: What happened...? Tighnari, is he...
Tighnari: Okay, okay, enough nonsense.
Tighnari: You just have a small fever. Take your medication and rest. You'll be bouncing off the walls in no time.
Yara: Really? Then... Can you keep the thing about the toy a secret for now?
Tighnari: No can do. You're a big kid now. Once you've recovered, go and apologize. Keeping secrets to yourself won't solve anything.
Yara: Aw...
Tighnari: Hey, let me ask you something... I recall that you're usually pretty healthy. How did you get this sick all of a sudden?
Yara: I don't know, either... Mom's been telling me not to play in the forest. I just wanted to look inside...
Yara: It's different from before... I got lost and went around in a huge circle.
Yara: After I got out, I started feeling dizzy...
Paimon: Could it be...
Traveler: The contaminated region?
Tighnari: ...
Tighnari: So that's how this whole mess happened. Anyway, go rest. No running around until I say so, got it?
Tighnari: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, let's step out for now.
Black Screen Text: You leave the room with Tighnari...
Asha: Mr. Forest Watcher, how is my son?
Tighnari: I gave him some antipyretics. Let him rest here for a while.
Tighnari: I told him that he would feel better after some medicine and rest, but I only said that to comfort him.
Tighnari: His symptoms resemble a fever, but something else is causing them. They seem more akin to a disruption in his psyche. Antipyretics won't be of much use.
Asha: What do we do? Mr. Forest Watcher, you have to help him!
Tighnari: If memory serves, a plant called Vasanti Grass can help soothe the mind.
Tighnari: A small number grow in arid deserts. They usually look like shriveled weeds, but can be revitalized with a splash of water.
Tighnari: They're expensive and unable to grow in the Avidya Forest's climate, so I don't have any on hand.
Tighnari: I'll ask the caravans. Go find Collei, have her prepare medicinal tools, and a set of traveling gear for me.
Asha: Alright! Thank you!
Tighnari: Contaminated region, huh... Is that why you two are also here?
Paimon: Yep. Is it a new Withering Zone?
Tighnari: Doesn't seem like one. Whether you look at scale, internal conditions, or resultant effects, they're completely different.
Tighnari: The only thing they have in common is that they aren't welcome. This nuisance made itself home in the Avidya Forest, so I can't turn a blind eye.
Paimon: We feel the same way!
Tighnari: Alright, let's contact the caravans first and purchase some Vasanti Grass. We can also ask about the contaminated region.
Tighnari: There's no time to waste. We have to move quickly. Let's go.

## Talk 3

Tighnari: Excuse me, I'd like to purchase some Vasanti Grass. Do you have any?
Mahir: I'm sorry, Mr. Forest Watcher, but we've been closed for the past few days.
Tighnari: Closed? Now that's odd. It's my first time hearing you say something like that.
Mahir: *sigh* It's a long story... Some of our goods were stolen recently.
Mahir: They were mechanical parts that we got from the Akademiya. Although they're old models, they still fetch a good price on the market.
Mahir: Our caravans had to pool together Mora to afford those parts. Now that they've been lost, we'll likely come up short this trip.
Mahir: All the merchants talked it over, and we decided to raise the prices of our remaining inventory. Until this plan takes effect, none of us can privately sell anything.
Tighnari: I don't get it. If these goods are so important, then why not think of a way to get them back?
Tighnari: Raising prices won't solve anything. At best, you're shoving the consequences of the robbery onto your customers.
Mahir: Mr. Forest Watcher, it's not that we don't want to, it's just the thief disappeared into the deepest parts of the forest.
Mahir: We asked around, and apparently the forest has been very unusual as of late. Anyone who goes in experiences mental anomalies.
Mahir: We can't keep waiting out here for the thief to come out. All we could do is come up with another solution.
Tighnari: So the bandit hid in the contaminated region after stealing those mechanical parts?
Tighnari: How many people were there in total? Were they not affected by the contaminated region?
Mahir: That crook CAME from the contaminated region! As for how many... Err... There weren't any "people."
Paimon: No people?
Mahir: *sigh* Even if I tell you, you might not believe me. *sigh* Fine, the thief that stole our parts was a huge, mechanical crab!
Paimon: What the heck!? The Avidya Forest has creatures like that?
Traveler: Is it that "crab"?
Mahir: To be honest, I'd rather not think about it... It moved too skillfully to be new at this.
Mahir: It came out of nowhere. Before we could react, it swiped our goods and ran away.
Mahir: We were all shocked. By the time we came to our senses, the thief was already long gone.
Tighnari: I see. If we help you retrieve your stolen goods, then business will return to normal?
Mahir: Oh, but of course.
Mahir: Not only that, but you'll become one of our caravan's VIPs. On all future purchases of any—
Tighnari: Enough. Tell me something that's actually useful. Any leads on that mechanical crab?
Mahir: Maybe one? After our goods were stolen, we specifically got someone to assess the situation.
Mahir: If you're interested, you can go and talk to them.
Tighnari: Alright, we'll go and have a word.
Traveler: Didn't see any in the Avidya Forest Field Guide...

## Talk 4

Akarsh: After the goods were stolen, I made multiple inquiries with nearby caravans and residents.
Akarsh: Turns out that many others have also been robbed by that crooked crab.
Akarsh: However, the crab only seems to be interested in machinery. It doesn't even bat an eye at other valuables.
Akarsh: A caravan carrying a large amount of Mora had an uneventful trip, but another caravan had a child whose metal toy was taken.
Akarsh: Whatever the case, that thing is a scourge! We'll eventually think of a way to get rid of it!

## Talk 5

Abdo: That mechanical crab is fast, strong, and a pain to deal with.
Abdo: Ten of us might not even be able to take that thing head-on.
Abdo: Didn't the Akademiya ban research on mechanical life forms years ago? Where did that thing come from?
Abdo: Our salaries even got slashed because of it... *sigh* Who would've thought that the robber wasn't a human, but a mechanical crab? This is rough...

## Talk 6

Kadin: I heard from the caravaners that there have been a lot of robberies lately, but we haven't been affected.
Kadin: We don't normally see the mechanical crab, and it doesn't disturb our daily lives.
Kadin: It only shows up when the caravans are here, and it runs back to the contaminated region after it's done making a mess.
Tighnari: You haven't tried capturing it?
Kadin: We have, but it's too agile and fast.
Kadin: However, we did unexpectedly learn something the last time we tried to capture it.
Kadin: It apparently lives in the deepest part of the forest, so instead of immediately moving its spoils, it first hides them nearby.
Kadin: Once its stash grows large enough, it moves everything in one go. You'll have to move fast if you want those goods back.

## Talk 7

Mahir: How are things? Did you make any progress?
Tighnari: We learned of its behaviors, but much still remains unclear.
Tighnari: Assuming normal operational status, mechanical constructs generally act according to their given commands.
Tighnari: If I were its owner, I'd command it to steal more valuable things... or the Mora you made. That would be the most efficient method.
Tighnari: But it only goes after mechanical components. This doesn't make any sense.
Paimon: Right! It's really weird!
Mahir: So you all found a way to retrieve our goods?
Tighnari: Do you have any more mechanical parts with you?
Mahir: Yes, I still have a small bag of samples. They weren't taken since I keep them on me at all times.
Mahir: Oh, are you planning to—
Tighnari: Under constant external conditions, organisms rarely initiate changes in their habits.
Tighnari: Here's what we know so far: It has a mechanical composition; it lives in the contaminated region; and it comes out to steal mechanical components.
Tighnari: If we have said components, we can lure it out, capture it, and then make observations for further conclusions.
Tighnari: Well... Chatting like this won't get us anywhere. We're only wasting time.
Mahir: You're right. We don't have any other options right now... This bag of samples is all yours, Mr. Forest Watcher. If you can get our goods back, the caravans will reward you generously.
Tighnari: We don't need anything in return, but I'll be keeping this bag. I may have other uses for it later.
Tighnari: We'll also need to borrow a Sumpter Beast. Our act has to be convincing if we want the crab to fall for it.
Mahir: Oh yeah, no problem at all! If it means getting our things back, you can even borrow me to do whatever you need!
Tighnari: I'll have to decline that offer. Anyway, we'll use the mechanical components and Sumpter Beast to pose as a transiting caravan and lure out the crab.
Tighnari: Once it appears, capture it. I leave the timing to you.
Paimon: Don't worry! We're professionals!

## Talk 8

Tighnari: Looking at the trade routes and the contaminated region's current perimeter, the goods were likely stolen somewhere around here.
Paimon: Then let's get to it! We'll definitely capture that criminal crab!
Tighnari: Okay. We'll start from here and have the Sumpter Beast, with the components on-board, lead the way.
Tighnari: This Sumpter Beast isn't familiar with us yet, so be calm and take your time with it.

## Talk 9

Yara: *sob* My head's still spinning...

## Talk 10

Karkata: Kulilu?
Paimon: Did you hear something—
Karkata: Kolu!
Paimon: Waaah! Is that the mechanical crab the caravan was talking about? It's charging straight at us!
Tighnari: It looks strong. Be careful!

## Talk 11

Karkata: Kuli...
Paimon: Hmph, just try to escape this time, you naughty, caravan-robbing crab!
Karkata: Kulilu?
Paimon: Hey, playing dumb won't save you! Spill it! Why are you stealing so many mechanical parts?
Traveler: It doesn't seem to understand us...
Tighnari: Hmm, it doesn't seem capable of comprehending complex questions. Keep an eye on it. I'll search around the area for the caravans' goods.
Black Screen Text: After some searching, Tighnari finds the goods that the mechanical crab stole...
Tighnari: I don't know why you're stealing mechanical parts, but they don't belong to you.
Tighnari: Stolen items must be returned to their rightful owners. Any objections?
Karkata: Kuli...
Traveler: It looks sad...
Tighnari: You came from the depths of the contaminated region, right? How about you help us with something?
Tighnari: If you take us there, I'll give you some mechanical parts as a reward.
Karkata: Kolu!
Paimon: It reacted!
Traveler: Does it understand us?
Tighnari: We can't be certain yet. Its excitement may be a simple, programmed response upon seeing mechanical components.
Paimon: Okay, so you want the crab to lead us into the contaminated region?
Tighnari: That's right. The contaminated region has a large and currently expanding perimeter, so it would be difficult to conduct a thorough search.
Tighnari: If we charge straight in, we'll get lost like headless pigeons. Also, our new friend here seems to be full of secrets.
Tighnari: I've been studying this contaminated region recently, and I have a hypothesis of my own. So to be absolutely safe, it would be best to have a "guide" lead the way.
Paimon: Paimon gets it now! Does this scuttler understand what you're saying?
Tighnari: It doesn't have to, as long as it isn't hostile towards us.
Tighnari: I gave it some components that it will definitely take back to the contaminated region. So long as it doesn't attack us, we can simply follow along.
Karkata: Kalu!
Paimon: It seems to be really happy...
Tighnari: Listen to me. Wait for us here. No running off.
Tighnari: We'll be back soon. If you're still here when we return, I'll give you another mechanical part as a reward. Understood?
Karkata: Kolu!
Traveler: Does that count as understanding us?
Tighnari: I'm not sure, but our priorities are to retrieve the mechanical components, and to purchase Vasanti Grass to make medicine with.
Tighnari: We should return, but before we do, we need to set up a few "traps." Can't have that crab escaping.

## Talk 12

Mahir: Oh, oh!
Mahir: These are the mechanical parts that were stolen! You really got them back for us!
Mahir: Thank you all so very much! I don't know how I can repay you... Wait, didn't you want to purchase Vasanti Grass?
Mahir: Don't worry about the price — they're on the house! How many do you need?
Tighnari: Two is enough.
Mahir: No, that won't do. Here, I'll throw in some Mora—
Tighnari: No need. I've already received a reward from you.
Mahir: Reward...? You mean that bag of mechanical parts? Ah, they aren't worth much compared to this merchandise.
Tighnari: But those parts are very useful to me, just like the Vasanti Grass.
Tighnari: I retrieved the things you needed, and you gave me what I needed in return. We're even.
Tighnari: Oh, and before we go, just a reminder, the forest has an intricate and biodiverse ecosystem. Even if there were no mechanical crabs, other dangers are still present. Take caution on this route.
Mahir: Noted! Thank you all ever so much!
Tighnari: Let's return to the village. The earlier we can give the child medicine, the sooner he'll start feeling better.

## Talk 13

Collei: #Oh, hi there, {NICKNAME} and Paimon.
Collei: Master, I prepared the pharmaceutical equipment. Do you need me to help grind the medicine?
Tighnari: No need. A precise dosage is required this time, so I'll do it myself.
Collei: Oh, okay...
Tighnari: But once I'm done, you can deliver the medication to the child.
Tighnari: He gets a little nervous when I'm around for too long. I don't think he finds me very approachable.
Tighnari: #I'll go prepare the medication. {NICKNAME}, give me a hand.
Black Screen Text: After you and Tighnari prepare the medicine, Collei gives it to Yara.
Paimon: How is he? Doing any better?
Collei: I feel like he's doing a lot better, and his temperature is returning to normal.
Paimon: That's wonderful!
Collei: Oh yeah, he asked me to tell you that Suna came by earlier, and he told her everything about the toy.
Collei: Suna didn't get mad, so he wanted to thank you. Can I ask what happened?
Tighnari: It's nothing. Did you prepare the traveling gear that I asked you to?
Collei: Of course I did! Are you going somewhere far away?
Tighnari: Yes, we're going to the contaminated region. Judging by its size, we will likely have to stay overnight.
Tighnari: I'm leaving everything to you while I'm gone.
Collei: Huh? But I... I can't even begin to compare to you...
Tighnari: Many things are learned by doing, and once they've been done, you'll realize that they weren't as difficult as you once thought they were.
Tighnari: Deal with problems as you yourself see fit. You don't have to emulate me.
Paimon: That's right! You'll do great, Collei!
Collei: Alright, then I'll do my best!
Collei: #Master, {NICKNAME}, Paimon, take care of yourselves.
Traveler: Don't worry.
Tighnari: I'm sure we'll be fine. I think you'll understand why once we arrive at the contaminated region.
Tighnari: Let's return and find that crab.
Traveler: Everything will be fine with Tighnari around.
Tighnari: You put too much confidence in me. Anyway, like you said, things will likely be uneventful.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Mahir: How's it going? Figured out a solution?

### Additional Talk 2

Mahir: *sigh* Trading sure is dangerous. Not only do you have to contend with the wits of others, but you have to be ready to deal with anything and everything...

### Additional Talk 3

Akarsh: We can't let it get away...

### Additional Talk 4

Abdo: *sigh* What a disaster...

### Additional Talk 5

Kadin: You know, I always thought it looked kinda familiar...

### Additional Talk 6

Mahir: Thank you all for your help. If it weren't for you, we would've lost a fortune.

### Additional Talk 7

Akarsh: In the end, the goods got stolen because you all didn't guard them properly.
Abdo: You're not wrong, but it's not entirely our fault. No one said we'd have to go up against a mechanical crab...
Abdo: You guys are in charge of caravan affairs, yet you didn't scout the trade route beforehand... Hey, you, here to help us settle this?
Kadin: Umm... I'm still more interested in the whereabouts of that mechanical crab...

### Additional Talk 8

Karkata: (The mechanical crab looks quite well-behaved and does not intend to run away.)
