Traveler: Mondstadter?
Bhai: The old man over there, who is constantly murmuring, "May the Anemo Archon bless us."
Bhai: I don't have anything against the Anemo Archon but I think the old man is trapped in the wind, he's going nowhere.
Bhai: His wife was a smart and capable captain of a merchant fleet, and I was her chief mate.
Bhai: *sigh* If she saw that old guy behaving like this, she'd rise from the ground and slap him right on the head!

Traveler: You don't like him?
Bhai: Honestly, I don't hate him at all. When he was young, he was passionate and talkative. He knew a great deal about poetry and singing, which was quite enviable.
Bhai: But now, his attitude is really driving me nuts. He could've done so much better than this!
Bhai: While you're alive, you should cherish what you have and live in the present instead of trapping yourself in the past.
Bhai: Old memories should be the nutrient of new life, not shackles keeping you in the endless loop of pain.
Bhai: The Greater Lord is a perfect example of this. She might have passed away, but what she left behind will nourish Sumeru for generations.
Bhai: This old thing has lived in Sumeru for so long yet still doesn't understand this. He hasn't learned a thing from her!

Traveler: Cherish what I have...
Bhai: When I was young, I used to travel around with the fleet, which taught me to cherish every drop of water and every flower.
