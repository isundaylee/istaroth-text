# Talk Dialog

Klee: Kaeya once told me that if I spend too much time playing in one day without resting, I'll be too tired to play the next day, and I'll miss out on all the fun.
Klee: So I decided: When the sun gets up, I'll get up, and when the sun goes to bed, I'll go to bed. That way, I'll always be full of energy!
Klee: #You should do what Kaeya says too, {M#Mr. Honorary Knight}{F#Miss Honorary Knight}!
