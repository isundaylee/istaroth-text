Traveler: So, any sights worth seeing in Liyue Harbor?
Kun: Oh, are you a traveler from another nation? Then I suggest that you must go and see one of Xinyan's performances.
Kun: Every time she performs, the ad-hoc stage she uses will burst into flames when the atmosphere reaches its peak!
Kun: Well, this did attract the attention of the higher-ups, and they put a stop to her performances in order to avoid any harm coming to members of the public.
Kun: But as much as I'm a Millelith, I'm also a loyal fan of hers. So I always try to sneak her some intel, so she can stage performances in the blind spots of our patrols.
Kun: Ahem. Don't tell on me to the sergeant! Her music is a great source of joy in my life. To let it be snuffed out would be such a shame!
