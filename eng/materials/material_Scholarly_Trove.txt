# Scholarly Trove

A detailed step-by-step blueprint for making a Scholarly Trove.
A healthy collection of texts has been placed here using the large bookcase preferred by all arms of the Tri-Commission. This could fit at least a hundred books for sure.

As such, one merely needs to arrange one's books according to how much one values them. For books that you have long ago read and committed to memory, you can lend them or even sell them if you like. They say that the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island has this exact habit.
