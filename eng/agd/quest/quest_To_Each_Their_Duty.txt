# To Each Their Duty


## Talk 1

Huffman: *sigh* It seems that we don't have any good options...
Traveler: Something the matter?
Huffman: Ah, it's you. Well... I'm sure you've seen those falling meteorites.
Huffman: While the city itself has been very fortunate to have avoided any meteorite hits, it's chaos outside.
Huffman: Between the people who fled into the city to seek shelter and those who fell unconscious without warning, we've got our hands full here.
Huffman: I'd like to recall all the knights who are currently attending to duties outside so we can settle matters within these four walls first.
Huffman: But they are currently dispersed out in the wild, and we haven't the extra numbers to go out and look for them.
Huffman: Could you lend me a hand and let them have a look at these Orders?

## Talk 2

Mack: Hello. Do you require anything?
Traveler: Here's some Orders for you...
Mack: Orders? Oh my. Let me have a look... Instructions to return to the city and help to settle various matters...
Mack: Um, so, I could go back to the city, but those two children simply don't want to do the same.
Mack: I have no idea where their parents have gone, and I don't want to forcibly bring them back, so I've been stuck here guarding them.
Mack: If I were to head back under these circumstances, I don't know what I'd do if something happened to them.
Mack: But I've tried several times to persuade them, and now they won't listen to me at all.
Mack: So... could you help me convince them? Maybe they might listen to you instead.
Mack: If you can convince them to return to the city, then I too can leave in peace.
Traveler: I'll give it a shot.
Mack: Great, thank you!

## Talk 3

Jill: Hmm? Is something wrong?
Traveler: Well, here's the situation...
Jill: Oh, I know about the meteorites. But... we haven't seen what they look like when they're coming down.
Jill: Will said he knew a good spot to watch them, so we came here.
Traveler: You can see them from the city too...
Jill: But we'd need to go somewhere really high up to see them if we were in the city.
Jill: The guards aren't going to let us to get up that high for sure...
Traveler: That nice man over there is willing to help.
Jill: Eh? You mean that weird old guy there? But the last time he came to talk to us, he looked really nasty.
Jill: He just wanted us to go back. Didn't say anything else at all...
Jill: But if he agrees to take us to a really high place to watch the meteorites, I think... I think we can go back.
Jill: But you'd best talk to Will. It was his idea, after all.

## Talk 4

Will: Hmm? Hello, is something up?
Traveler: Well, here's the situation...
Will: I know, that's why we came out here — to see the meteorites. Don't worry, we'll go back once we've seen them.
Traveler: You can see them from the city too...
Will: But then we'd need to get way up high. I tried lots of times, but the guards kept yelling at me to come down. I got a scolding from them afterwards.
Will: That's why I brought Jill over here.
Traveler: That nice guard over there will help us out.
Will: Help us? Do you mean he can take us to a high point in the city to watch the meteorites?
Will: That can't be... He looks so weird, and angry, too...
Traveler: I have his Orders with me.
Will: Really? Let me see them! Wow... these really are the official Orders of the Knights!
Will: With this, that man will take us up to see the meteorites, won't he?
Will: Hehe... Watching the meteorites from inside the city would be the best!
Will: Well, you go have a word with him. I'll talk to Jill.
Will: Ah, I really can't wait... I wanna see the meteorites falling.

## Talk 5

Mack: How did it go? Did you manage to convince them?
Traveler: Well, so it would seem...
Mack: Really? That's great! Thank you so much— actually, wait... What do you mean "so it would seem"?
Traveler: You just need to do your part...
Mack: My part? What does that mean...
Mack: Eh? You want me to take them to the highest point in Mondstadt and watch the meteors fall? That's... rather dangerous.
Mack: Not to mention that they're kids, too. I'll have to report this to Headquarters first...
Traveler: I've got your Orders right here, you know.
Mack: That's... not how you use it, I don't think.
Mack: Well, never mind. As long as we can get those kids back to the city, I'll... I'll figure something out.
Traveler: Really?
Mack: Of course, I swear it on my honor as a knight and... as an adult.
Mack: No matter who it is, our word is as good as our bond.
Mack: Thanks for your help. Leave the rest to me — I'll bring them back to the city shortly.
Mack: Afterwards, I'll figure out how to get them to Mondstadt's highest point...

## Talk 6

Harry: Hello. Do you need help with anything?
Traveler: Have a look at these Orders...
Harry: Orders? Allow me... So, instructions to return to the city, huh?
Harry: My apologies, but I will have to execute these duties later, as I still have important matters to attend to.
Harry: It seems as if the monsters around these parts have been affected by the meteorites. They've become much more violent, and are exceptionally dangerous.
Harry: I have to clean them out in order to ensure this area's safety.
Traveler: But there's no one here, is there?
Harry: Well, it's precisely because no one's around that I'm free to fight these monsters.
Harry: This is a very important matter. I cannot leave while it remains undone.
Traveler: I'll help.
Harry: Great, thank you. There's not one, but a few concentrations of monsters in this area.
Harry: Let's split up and destroy all the monsters in our respective areas, and we'll link up here once we're done.
Traveler: Let's do this together.

## Talk 7

Harry: Those monsters were really hard to handle...
Harry: I've settled matters on my end. How goes it on yours?
Traveler: We're done here as well.
Harry: Haha, you've got fine moves, don't you? Thanks so much for your help. I don't think those monsters will return to these parts for a while.
Harry: Still, I can't return just yet. Other than these monsters, there are still more roaming about in the Stormbearer Mountains.
Harry: I want to continue gathering intelligence here — and if someone were to come to harm nearby, I would be on hand to rescue them.
Harry: Not everyone is aware of the call to seek shelter, after all.
Harry: Alright, then. Please convey my intent to Mr. Huffman. I'm sure he'll understand.

## Talk 8

Huffman: So, how has it gone? Have they all seen the Orders?
Traveler: They did, but...
Huffman: "But"? Did something happen?
