Kaida Ryouma: Our troops still can't get the upper hand over the Shogun's Army.
Kaida Ryouma: But the next time we fight them, we must be sure to establish a position of absolute superiority.

Traveler: Tell me more about yourself, if you would...
Kaida Ryouma: Before serving as an officer here, I used to live on Narukami Island and work for the Kujou Clan.
Kaida Ryouma: Hah... Life is full of twists. Who knew then that I would be fighting against them now?
Kaida Ryouma: I remember the two brothers from the Kujou Clan. They were understanding and very well aware of the commoners' situation. I didn't think they would support this war...
Kaida Ryouma: But now that we are on different sides, there is nothing for us but to do battle.

Traveler: About the Sangonomiya troops...
Kaida Ryouma: Compared to the elite troops of the Shogunate, we do appear to be the weaker side. But as an officer, I must have absolute confidence in our victory.
Kaida Ryouma: Also, we are backed by Her Excellency and General Gorou. The two of them are both brave and thoughtful leaders. They will lead us to victory.

Kaida Ryouma: Ah, it's you, Traveler. How have you been?

Traveler: About the ceasefire...
Kaida Ryouma: The Shogunate and Sangonomiya have entered peace talks, and the Vision Hunt Decree has been abolished. Good news all around, if you ask me.
Kaida Ryouma: Her Excellency and General Gorou truly are impressive, achieving victory like that despite our disadvantageous position.
Kaida Ryouma: Well, we do have you to thank as well for the current outcome. I've heard that you were the one who caused the Raiden Shogun to have a change of heart.
Kaida Ryouma: That we were able to obtain the aid of a brilliant person like you is Sangonomiya's great fortune, haha!
Kaida Ryouma: *sigh* I just wonder how my old place, the Tenryou Commission, is doing...

Traveler: About the Tatarigami...
Kaida Ryouma: I'm not very sure about what happened there either.
Kaida Ryouma: That said, considering the way the war went, it might well have been the work of Fatui special forces.
Kaida Ryouma: It's normal to use extraordinary methods to gain an advantage over one's foes in war. The Kujou art of war I learned once was famed for its swift and brutal assaults that care little for the cost.
Kaida Ryouma: But Her Excellency's playbook is quite different...
Kaida Ryouma: In any case, she was out at sea negotiating with some mercenaries. I don't think she would have been apprised of what happened here in time.
Kaida Ryouma: Thus, the only viable suspects in my eyes are the Fatui, who do really seem to enjoy poking their noses into other peoples' business...
Kaida Ryouma: Of course, this is just my opinion, I doubt that a simple samurai like myself could grasp the breadth of Her Excellency's thought.

Traveler: Everyone contributed to our success.
Kaida Ryouma: Oh, come on, you don't have to be that humble. That said, you are correct to say that this is the result of everyone's ceaseless struggle...
Kaida Ryouma: And that's why it's important that we further unite in the future and protect what we've won.

Traveler: What have you heard about the Tenryou Commission?
Kaida Ryouma: I've heard that they were convicted of a major crime. Who knows how the Almighty Shogun will deal with them? Ah, what a shame, especially for the two Kujou brothers...
Kaida Ryouma: I was once a retainer of the Kujou Clan before coming here. The two Kujou brothers were both good administrators, concerned about the welfare of the people. I wonder if they've been dragged through the mud as well...
Kaida Ryouma: I've heard that Kujou Kamaji's taken up the role of Provisional Clan Head. I hope he'll be up to the task...
