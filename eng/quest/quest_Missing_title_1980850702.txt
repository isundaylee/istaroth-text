## Talk 1

Traveler: I picked this up earlier...
Michica: Did you, now? Some idiot must have lost it along the way again. Let me see...

## Talk 5

Traveler: I'm here about this missing letter...

## Talk 6

Michica: Looks like... it's for Acat.
Michica: ...The packaging's broken. If we resend it as-is, the whole item might get ruined.
Michica: I still need to sort out the packages in the store, so could you help me send this to her?
Michica: She's the owner of Frida's Palette. Don't worry, you couldn't miss her shop's sign even if you tried.

## Talk 7

Michica: This... looks like Chanca's handwriting.
Michica: If I had to guess, this must be another order invoice. The packaging here is broken — there's no way we can deliver it this way. This letter shall have to be returned.
Michica: I still need to sort out the packages in the store, so could you help send this back to Chanca in my stead?
Michica: She's the owner of the Weary Inn near the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. You can't miss it.

## Talk 8

Michica: Muhuru's Gemporium... Imix? Agh, this is an invoice she sent out, isn't it?
Michica: If this gets lost in transit, that kid's going to get an earful from Ms. Cheven.
Michica: I still need to sort out the packages in the store, so could you help me send this back to Imix?
Michica: Muhuru's Gemporium is in the Children of Echoes' lands — and it's an easy find if ever there was one.

## Talk 9

Michica: ...This letter's from Tirda, if I'm not mistaken.
Michica: Was she trying to get it sent to her tribe? But it's a mess now... We're going to have to return it.
Michica: I still need to sort out the packages in the store, so could you help get this back to Tirda in my stead?
Michica: She sings at the Golden Dusk. You'll find her in no time.

## Talk 10

Traveler: About the package we're looking for...

### Additional Talk 1

Acat: Yeah, this one's mine. Someone from the Children of Echoes wanted to purchase paints, but couldn't tell me what colors he wanted to save his life.
Acat: That's why I sent him a package with several small bottles of paint in it — so he could get his preferences straight before he next shows up.
Acat: I'll get this resent — better that than him coming over here with his ridiculous reference requests...
Acat: Ah, right. This is for you. Thanks for getting this package back to me.

### Additional Talk 2

Chanca: Huh? Yeah, this is my order. Didn't think it would meet with such bad luck...
Chanca: Oh well. I'll just have to write another later. This isn't super urgent, anyway.
Chanca: Anyway, thanks for bringing the letter back to me. You're sweating all over — here, have a drink on me.

### Additional Talk 3

Imix: Yeah, this one's mine — it's the package I sent out!
Imix: Oh, thank goodness, I thought I'd sent it off to the wrong address... I'd be smoked if that was the case!
Imix: Thank you, truly! Please, take these.
Imix: Also, uh... Could you not tell Ms. Cheven about this? I'm begging you!

### Additional Talk 4

Tirda: ...Yes. This letter's mine. Thank you.
Tirda: I'll write a new one soon. Then I'll get someone to send it to the Flower-Feather Clan.
Tirda: ...I hope this next one makes it there safely.
Tirda: Here, you've earned this.
