# Fecund Hamper

Annette: Hello and welcome to Weinlesefest. May Lord Barbatos bless you.
Paimon: #Hey, {NICKNAME}, look! There's a noticeboard here, and there's a whole bunch of paper pinned to it. Is it a commission board or something?
Annette: Hehe, no, they're not commissions. These are clues to find Fecund Hampers.
Paimon: What's a Fecund Hamper? Ooh! Is it a sort of treasure?
Annette: That's one way to look at it. It seems it's your first time participating in the festival. Would you like me to give you a brief explanation?
Traveler: Well, since Paimon's so interested...
Annette: Alright. Simply put, a Fecund Hamper is a gift prepared by residents for lucky outsiders during the festival.
Annette: We aren't just welcoming the return of Lord Barbatos, but we also mean to share the joy of harvest and reminisce about good times.
Annette: Everyone will put a gift in a wooden box shaped like a barrel and hide it in a place that holds memories for them.
Annette: Next, the owner of the gift will leave clues. The first person, no matter who, to find the box will get that gift.
Annette: Other than gifts, everyone will also leave a message in the box to the person who finds it. This is a sincere blessing, often more valuable than the gift itself.
Paimon: This sounds pretty fun!
Annette: So, would the two of you like to try looking for a Fecund Hamper? You should be able to work the clues out easily if you have some knowledge of Mondstadt customs.
Paimon: #Let's try, {NICKNAME}! We might even find a gift from someone we know!
Annette: Good luck and have fun!
Traveler: Go ahead, please.
