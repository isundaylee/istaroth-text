Traveler: That girl?
Amir: Oh... She's a Trainee Forest Ranger with us.
Amir: She... is in poor health, so she's here to learn and recuperate at the same time.
Amir: She's so young yet so eager to excel. I'm still quite worried about her condition.
Amir: That's why I asked the search and rescue dogs to pay attention to her condition and notify me immediately if something happens. That's the only way I can be there in time to help her.
