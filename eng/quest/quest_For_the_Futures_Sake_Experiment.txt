# For the Future's Sake, Experiment!

Frejus: The data indicates that this invention is a success. Thank you both.
Chenee: Yup, thanks!
Chenee: See, I told you this would go well! With your genius in play, Frejus, this remote-controlled cannon thing was a piece of cake!
Frejus: I—I suppose...
Chenee: In that case, let's get cracking with the next awesome gadget — and I have a great idea for one, too!
Frejus: What?
Chenee: What about an airship that can explore the skies?
Frejus: Um...
Chenee: Or a mega drill that can bore deep underground?
Frejus: Hah...
Paimon: Feels like she's trying to make his life difficult on purpose...
Traveler: Those might be a bit of a tall order...
Chenee: I mean, you're the one who rejected the Institute's offer three times. I'm sure you can make stuff even they can't, right?
Frejus: Of course. I can only say that it will be tricky, but not a big deal.
Chenee: *sigh* You know what? I don't want those things anymore. Flying up into the sky or delving into the earth both sound boring. It's cold up there, and it's stuffy down there.
Frejus: I share that sentiment.
Chenee: In that case, could you make something that we'd use normally? ...Ooh, that's right! I love sleeping in in the mornings, so could you make me an automatic oven that bakes on its own?
Paimon: Well now, that sounds possible.
Traveler: Her earlier suggestions were intentionally impossible, I think.
Frejus: Alright, let me consider how this might be designed.
Chenee: Nice! I'll take that as agreement — and if it does prove impossible, you'll just have to make me breakfast in the future, eh, Frejus?
Frejus: What? What sort of request is that... In any case, you needn't worry, I'm sure such a small invention is well within my skill. I am, after all, a "genius."

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Frejus: Hmm... Judging by the experimental data, there might still be a few issues with this invention. In any case, thank you both for your help.
Chenee: Yup, thanks!
Chenee: Aw, are you feeling discouraged, Frejus? Don't worry! If a genius like you is having trouble, that just means that this research angle was problematic from the start!
Frejus: I—I suppose...
Chenee: In that case, let's get cracking with the next awesome gadget — and I have a great idea for one, too!
Frejus: What?
Chenee: What about an airship that can explore the skies?

Traveler: Those might be a bit of a tall order...
Chenee: I mean, you're the one who rejected the Institute's offer three times. I'm sure you can make stuff even they can't, right?
Frejus: But of course.
Chenee: *sigh* You know what? I don't want those things anymore. Flying up into the sky or delving into the earth both sound boring. It's cold up there, and it's stuffy down there.
Frejus: I share that sentiment.
