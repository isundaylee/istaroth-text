Esteban: Hmm... This will be tricky...

## Talk

Traveler: Hello there. You're...
Esteban: Hmm? Oh, sorry, I was thinking about a certain problem earlier...
Esteban: I'm a court stenographer. I happen to be done with work at the moment... But do you have anything else for me?

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry for bothering you.
Esteban: It's no trouble. See you.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about the trial courts...
Esteban: You won't find the court here. Pursuit of criminal cases takes place at the Opera Epiclese on Erinnyes.
Esteban: That is the home of the divine judge, the mechanism known as the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, the second layer of insurance behind the judges themselves.
Esteban: Well, I'm just a stenographer, so that's what I do — record the proceedings within the opera house.

## Talk

Traveler: What's troubling you?
Esteban: Well, judging cases is not under my purview, but having seen my fair share of trials, I can't help but think of how I should handle various dilemmas...
Esteban: Between the process and the result, which is more important?
Esteban: Is there a way to balance reason and jurisprudence?
Esteban: Between infinite time and infinite Mora, which would I choose?
Esteban: ...Oh, sorry, I'm all over the place, aren't I? Heh, not that these issues have anything to do with me, either...

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about the courtroom...
Esteban: You won't find any courtrooms here. Criminal cases are heard in the Opera Epiclese on Erinnyes.
Esteban: Hmm... I always feel something's missing without the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale and Lady Furina. But the court is hearing cases as usual.
Esteban: The atmosphere of the court won't affect the fairness of the proceedings.
Esteban: Well, I'm just a stenographer, so that's what I do — record the proceedings within the opera house.
