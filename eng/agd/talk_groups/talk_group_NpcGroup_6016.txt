Traveler: Tell me about the Pilgrimage...
Karpa: The Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame is where contestants may win ultimate glory. All the people of Natlan are welcome to take part.
Karpa: The Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame is held as needed in response to the Abyssal threat. As the incursions have grown worse in recent years, it's been held more frequently.
Karpa: In the name of victory, may you all keep fighting until the very end.
Karpa: But remember, you must never foment conflict for its own sake. All malicious acts will be laid bare under the Pyro Archon's vigilant gaze.
