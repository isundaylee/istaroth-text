Manager's Message: "If none of the gemstone designs we provide catch your fancy, clients are welcome to provide their own processing blueprints."
Manager's Message: "Manager Cheven and her apprentice Imix both accept custom design orders. Depending on the complexity of the request, it may take anywhere between two weeks to two months."
Manager's Message: "In addition, from time to time our store will release special gemstone designs personally cut and polished by Xilonen herself. Quantities are limited, so get them while supplies last."
Manager's Message: "If you're interested in purchasing one, be sure to keep an eye on our shelves!"

Manager's Message: "As for ads like 'Muhuru's Gemporium has been a trusted seller for over a century, guaranteed genuine or get 10 times your money back'... We have no need for them."
Manager's Message: "As the previous manager said: 'If our store sells a single fake or even anything low-quality, then feel free to take a hammer and smash every single gem we've got!'"
Manager's Message: "Anyway, if you've already found a great gem, we offer polishing and cutting services. We'll process the gem any way you like, in any style you want."
Manager's Message: "Just don't ask us to 'carve it into the shape of a Grainfruit' or something like that. Anything else is fine!"
