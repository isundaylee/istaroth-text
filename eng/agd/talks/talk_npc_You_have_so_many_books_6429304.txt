Traveler: You have so many books...
Aderfi: And you have so many words, young one.
Aderfi: Stop staring at those books... Let me tell you a tale. A tale regarding a most meddlesome and naive wayfarer who wanted to report our tribe to the Matra. Can you guess what happened?
Aderfi: ... What happened was someone discovered the foolishness he was about to commit, and that someone helped us fix his long and loose tongue.
