Puca: Ah, hello! How are things? Is there anything you'd like to know about the ores? You can ask me anything!

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about your ores...
Puca: Yup, I've got all sorts of pretty ores with me. Whatever you want, I might just have it here!
Puca: Most of them are ordinary, not like those previous gems my big sister has...

## Talk

Traveler: Could you tell me about the ores' uses?
Puca: Hmm, I've never thought about that before... I only collect stones because they're pretty...
Puca: Honestly, I think it's funny how people from outside find these ores useful.

Traveler: See you.
Puca: Seeya! If you do find pretty stones, be sure to tell me about it!

Puca: Most of them are pretty ordinary, but even normal ones must have their own awesome uses, right?

Traveler: How's the situation with the clocks?
Puca: According to Mr. Chesil, he'll soon be able to make new, beautiful clocks.
Puca: He even took me on a tour of the place where they process the stones. The pretty stones were cut up into tiny, tiny pieces...
Puca: I didn't quite get what was going on, but Mr. Chesil said that those stones will turn into the hearts of those clocks...
Puca: Him saying that made me so happy, too.
Puca: But he says that he's going to exchange more Mora for more stones...
Puca: Mora is very shiny, but every coin looks the same â€” I don't wanna exchange my stones for those.
