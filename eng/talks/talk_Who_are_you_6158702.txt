Traveler: Who are you?
Timaeus: I am Timaeus, an alchemy scholar. You may not have heard my name before...
Timaeus: But I bet you'll have heard the names Albedo and Sucrose before.
Timaeus: Albedo is nothing short of a genius in the field of alchemy. And his assistant, Sucrose, is extremely talented for her age.
Timaeus: I'm a total amateur compared to them.
Traveler: About Albedo...
Timaeus: Albedo is an alchemy prodigy. A lot of people call him the Kreideprinz. He's the top alchemical talent in Mondstadt.
Timaeus: They say he's an outlander who just showed up in Mondstadt one day and was instantly taken on as Chief Alchemist by the Knights of Favonius. He's also Captain of the Investigation Team.
Timaeus: His alchemical theory is refreshingly unbridled in comparison to conventional theories. In practice it all works out too.
Timaeus: In his eyes, my work must seem like child's play... *sigh*
Traveler: About Sucrose...
Timaeus: Sucrose is Albedo's only assistant. She's so lucky to have gained Albedo's appreciation.
Timaeus: As a born and bred child of Mondstadt, we should all be proud of Sucrose's contributions to alchemy.
Timaeus: But her research and interests are a little... antiquated, to the point that they rarely render any practical application.
Timaeus: *sigh* If I had access to such a plethora of resources, who knows what I could accomplish.
