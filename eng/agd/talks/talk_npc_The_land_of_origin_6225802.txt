Traveler: The land of origin?
Hitomi: Are you interested in tea preparation too? Then allow me to briefly expound on my understanding...
Hitomi: They say that Inazuman tea and tea ceremonies originate from Liyue, and so Liyue is considered the origin of such practices.
Hitomi: Today, however, Inazuman and Liyue tea ceremonies have completely diverged.
Hitomi: In Qiaoying Village, this novel roasted tea exudes a vibrant aroma.
Hitomi: I think it can be considered the harmony of tea ceremonies.
Hitomi: The blend of the same tea leaves with the tastes of new places eventually causes it to evolve into new forms.
