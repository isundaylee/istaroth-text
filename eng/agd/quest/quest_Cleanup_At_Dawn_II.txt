# Cleanup At Dawn II


## Talk 1

Moco: What're we gonna do!?
Hillie: Adelinde is totally gonna freak out...
Traveler: What's up?
Moco: So, Adelinde asked us to tidy up the area around the Winery.
Hillie: Most places were fine, but there are all these haystacks lying around.
Moco: Connor said he's storing them here because he needs them for something.
Hillie: They're bound pretty tight, so at least they didn't get blown away in the wind. But still, a load of leaves got blown in among the hay.
Moco: We worked really hard at it, but we still didn't manage to get all the leaves out.
Hillie: If we keep on at this pace, the head housemaid Adelinde is gonna freak out... What're we gonna do?
Traveler: Allow me.
Moco: Seriously? You're awesome! Thanks.
Traveler: So, the leaves are hard to get rid of?
Hillie: When they're mixed in with the hay they sure are. We have to pick them out one by one, which takes forever...
Hillie: If you've got a better idea, I'm all ears!

## Talk 2

Moco: How did it go?
Hillie: Did you get them all?
Traveler: Every last one.
Moco: Oh my gosh, you're awesome!
Hillie: Traveler, you're the best person ever!
Moco: Thanks! Now Adelinde won't be on our backs.
Hillie: Please take these as our thank-you gift.
Moco: Right, we've got other places to clean now. Thanks again! See you.

## Talk 3

Moco: What did you go and do that for!? You've burned down the haystack!
Hillie: Gee thanks... now Adelinde's gonna freak out for sure â€” and on top of that, she's definitely gonna fire us too!
Traveler: It was an accident...
Moco: Ugh, we should've just kept on picking them out one by one.
Hillie: Darn it... There's no way back from this...
Traveler: I, ah...
Moco: Traveler, you'd better get outta here. This was our responsibility.
Hillie: It's our fault for getting someone to help who doesn't know a thing about cleaning.
Moco: What is Adelinde gonna do when she finds out...
Hillie: She's gonna be so mad...

## Talk 4

Moco: Ugh, my clothes are filthy now.
Hillie: And we didn't even clear out all the leaves.
Moco: What're we gonna do?
