Eye-Catching Slogan: The Soaring Saurian is open all day! If you wish to join Matahga's special training, then come lift off from the Soaring Saurian! Note:

Matahga! Remember!!!: The code is: Blow the left horn first, then the right one, then the left again, and finally the right... but blow 'em at your own peril!
Matahga! Remember!!!: Feeding a Saurian some Fowl is the best way to keep one in a good mood and avoid getting pecked!
Matahga! Remember!!!: (Seems like a reminder that someone called Matahga left for themselves. You can feel the intensity of the emotion in their words.)
Matahga! Remember!!!: (But surely putting exclamation marks at the end of every reminder is the same as putting none... Isn't it?)

### Additional Talk 10

"Lavender Flower": (A romance novel written by Dorothy Leeckson. On its faded cover, a woman lies on a bed surrounded by flowers.)
"Lavender Flower": (After skimming through the book, you feel warm and content, but haven't gained any useful insights.)
Paimon: So... Was it her family's gardener or her best friend's cousin's brother-in-law?... Ugh, Paimon's head hurts!

### Additional Talk 11

"Detective Snowpaws": (The biography of Frank Drebin, retired Inspector of Fontaine's Marechaussee Phantom special police force. Yep, the Inspector is a vigorous white cat.)
"Detective Snowpaws": (A big cat paw print is imprinted on the title page of this book, perhaps a special memento the Inspector has left for his subordinates.)
Paimon: Seriously... Might as well write a book about Paimon too, called... The White-Haired Detective!

### Additional Talk 12

"History of Teyvat: Part I": (A work by Fontainian playwright, Jean Brooklyn. A book this thick can totally be used by shorter people to increase their height.)

Holy Sovereign's Notes (IV): (Most of the rest of the content has been burned and is illegible.)

### Additional Talk 15

Monetoo: ?
Paimon: On closer inspection, it does seem odd that the only empty jar is the one in front of this Monetoo...
Paimon: Did the other Monetoo find what they were looking for but this one didn't?
Paimon: #Poor thing... C'mon, Traveler, let's help it find the stuff that was meant to fit in this jar... Hmm. What would that be, though?
Traveler: (Place)

### Additional Talk 16

Monetoo: ?
Paimon: Umm, this doesn't look to be the right thing...

### Additional Talk 17

Monetoo: !
Paimon: Ah, so this is what we're looking for — something with red in it!
Paimon: Wait... Huh? The stuff we threw in is gone... We did chuck something in, right? Something doesn't feel quite right here...
Paimon: Is there something else in the jar?
Paimon: (Knock on the jar)

### Additional Talk 18

A Child's Notes: (Childish, scribbled writings are visible:)
A Child's Notes: This game's called "Bing Bong Ding Dong," and here's the rules:
A Child's Notes: 1. When the Bing Bong Monetoo isn't ding-donging, ride on the Saurian statue's back to make it move forward.
A Child's Notes: 2. Get off the Saurian statue when the Bing Bong Monetoo counts down to a "ding!" or you'll lose.
A Child's Notes: 3. First one to run to the Bing Bong Monetoo wins!
A Child's Notes: And don't give me that "isn't this just Red Light, Green Light?" crap. Rules are important, and it's precisely because you don't respect the rules that you can't win!
