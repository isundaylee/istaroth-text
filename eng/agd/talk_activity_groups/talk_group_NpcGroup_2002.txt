Yong'an: Come to think of it, I saw a girl trying to give them some milk while I was on morning patrol...ACHOO!
Yong'an: Thank goodness I was able to stop her. Well, not that she meant them any ill, but cats will get upset stomachs from drinking milk!
Yong'an: ...Maybe it's because I've been around cats for so long, but I've also stopped liking milk myself. Here, you take them...ACHOO!

Traveler: Seen anyone around who looks a fair bit like me?
Yong'an: Ahhchoo! ...I've been patrolling the wharf the whole time, but I can't say I've seen anyone who looks like you.
Yong'an: *sigh* But I could always have missed something...
Yong'an: After sticking with the cats for too long, I've gotten bad at remembering faces. I even mistook our sergeant for some old fellow asking for directions...
Yong'an: Ah... Ah... I will keep a look out when I'm on patrol in future. While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevACHOO!
