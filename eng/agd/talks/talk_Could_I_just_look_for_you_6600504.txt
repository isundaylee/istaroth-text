Traveler: Could I just look for you?
Mansa: In theory, of course. But most of the time I have to stay here to help adventurers who come for advice.
Mansa: There's no doubt that Ms. Katheryne is extremely reliable, but when it comes to all things Natlan, no one's more knowledgeable than us natives.
Mansa: And in terms of their abilities, the Scions of the Canopy or the People of the Springs would make even better tour guides than I would.
Mansa: As for me... Well, if you'd like, I can tell your fortune before you set off, I suppose?
