# The Truth Is Also a Lie


## Talk 1

Paimon: Looks like the wedding is definitely going ahead.
Kamisato Ayato: It's still too early to make that conclusion. Our adversary wants to push this marriage past the point of no return. However, we can still beat them at their own game.
Kamisato Ayato: But only if Kujou Kamaji is willing to help us.

## Talk 2

Hashimoto: Did you see that? Sir Kujou Kamaji just came past here with a huge group of people.
Nagase: Could it be related to the wedding announcement?
Hashimoto: Maybe... but from the look on his face, it seems like something much more serious.
Hashimoto: He and his men seem pretty intense at the moment. Isn't it all a bit excessive for a wedding?

## Talk 3

Yamaue: The Tenryou Commission has sent a load of people to Ritou. I guess it must have something to do with the wedding.
Yamaue: I think in all there must have been about a hundred people so far.
Tokunaga: That doesn't sound good. What could be going on?
Tokunaga: Ah, I hope it's just Sir Kujou Kamaji being overcautious.

## Talk 4

Hideo: The news is spreading fast, but it appears Master's fears may be well-placed.
Hideo: There's no way they sent this many people just to escort the bride...
Hideo: I have to investigate.

## Talk 5

Paimon: He ran off...
Kamisato Ayato: As expected. Let's follow him.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Uh-oh, seems like he's noticed us...
Paimon: Knew we should've been quieter...

## Talk 7

Paimon: Huh? Where'd he go?
Paimon: He was right there a moment ago... Seems he disappeared in the blink of an eye.
Paimon: If only we'd made less noise..

## Talk 8

Kujou Kamaji: Welcome. I just heard that the news of my wedding has been officially announced.
Kujou Kamaji: It seems so sudden... I wasn't ready yet.
Paimon: Yeah, about that... It's kinda complicated...
Black Screen Text: You briefly explain the situation to Kujou Kamaji...
Kujou Kamaji: I see... So someone's trying to take advantage of our marriage...
Kamisato Ayato: If you proceed with the wedding, the repercussions for you are likely to be minimal. But we must take Lady Hiiragi's situation into consideration.
Kujou Kamaji: I've previously considered this possibility. But in the end, we are getting married for true love, and I've promised to her that I'll do everything in my power to protect her.
Kamisato Ayato: I understand where you're coming from, but to be frank, she should not need your protection.
Kamisato Ayato: Or to put it another way, you have tacitly admitted that Lady Hiiragi will need your help to get through the hard times ahead, which perhaps suggests that, deep down, you realize all she stands to lose.
Kujou Kamaji: I...
Kamisato Ayato: I don't mean to criticize you. It is natural to want to protect our loved ones. You're an intelligent and gentle person, and I'm sure you would have been able to think about this more objectively were you not so emotionally involved in the situation.
Kamisato Ayato: I'm sure you admire Lady Hiiragi for being the independent, gentle, resilient, and strong-willed person she is.
Kamisato Ayato: For the sake of marrying you, this wonderful woman will become someone who has to depend on you for the rest of her life.
Kamisato Ayato: Are you really okay with that?
Kujou Kamaji: ...
Kujou Kamaji: I love her with all my heart and would do anything to make her happy...
Kujou Kamaji: ...That's why I cannot abide to see her suffer or be manipulated by other people.
Kujou Kamaji: Yashiro Commissioner, you're right... It was naive and selfish of me to take things this far.
Kujou Kamaji: But it's too late now, isn't it? There are notices everywhere...
Kamisato Ayato: I have a plan. But... it needs a villain.
Kamisato Ayato: Sir Kujou, in order for my plan to work, you and I must both play the role of antagonists. But it is not without its risks.
Kamisato Ayato: Are you willing to help?
Kujou Kamaji: If there's a way to salvage this, then let's hear it.
Kamisato Ayato: I've told the people at the Kanjou Commission that the marriage isn't going to unify the Kanjou Commission and the Tenryou Commission. On the contrary, it's a terrible idea that will marginalize the Kanjou Commission.
Kamisato Ayato: The context for this is that they are planning to use this marriage to bring down the Hiiragi Clan, and the key to their success is coming up against no resistance to the marriage from the Tenryou Commission.
Kamisato Ayato: But what if we were to imagine for a moment that since the affairs of the Vision Hunt Decree, the Tenryou Commission has been planning to make a move against the weakened Kanjou Commission...
Kamisato Ayato: The only reason you have been hesitant to act since taking over the Tenryou Commission is because you care about Lady Hiiragi's feelings.
Kamisato Ayato: And so, your plan is to liaise with the Yashiro Commission to marry her and bring her out of the Kanjou Commission as soon as possible.
Kamisato Ayato: Once that is achieved, as the person in charge of the Tenryou Commission, you no longer have any reason to hesitate.
Kujou Kamaji: I see! This is an ingenious plan, and takes advantage of the situation perfectly...
Traveler: This will make Hiiragi Chisato indispensable.
Kamisato Ayato: Exactly. Our purpose is to change Lady Hiiragi's position from an unnecessary burden to an indispensable asset.
Kamisato Ayato: By doing so, we can even strengthen her position in the Kanjou Commission.
Kamisato Ayato: Once our adversaries realize how the network of connections behind the scenes really looks, they'll do their utmost to stop this wedding from happening.
Kamisato Ayato: Then, we simply leave them to clear up the mess they've created.
Kujou Kamaji: Got it.
Paimon: Ugh... So the network of connections... Ah, this is all way too complicated for Paimon! Can you just tell us what you need us to do?
Kamisato Ayato: We have to make sure that the behind-the-scenes story comes to the attention of our dear friends in the Kanjou Commission.
Kamisato Ayato: Matsuura, with whom I spoke earlier, will now be fearing the worst. No doubt he'll be on the lookout for the first sign of a crisis.
Kamisato Ayato: In that case, he will almost certainly have placed informants throughout Inazuma City. What we need to do is to use these informants as a breeding ground for our fake intel.
Kamisato Ayato: Sir Kujou, there are certain things that I need you to attend to personally.
Black Screen Text: Kamisato Ayato explains the details of his plan to Kujou Kamaji. A while later...
Kamisato Ayato: It's almost time. My ninja has located one of the informants. Let's go and see if he'll take the bait.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Wow! It's like the whole Tenryou Commission is here!
Hideo: Excuse me, has something happened on this road?
Hideo: I'm a businessman passing through, and it's a little disconcerting to see this place so heavily guarded.
Okabayashi: Ah, please don't be alarmed. As I'm sure you've heard, the wedding of Sir Kujou Kamaji and Lady Hiiragi Chisato will take place any day now.
Okabayashi: Sir Kujou decided to send for Lady Hiiragi ahead of time and have her live in Inazuma City during the run-up to the wedding.
Hideo: I see...
Okabayashi: We are here to clear the way for Lady Hiiragi.
Okabayashi: Not just us, either. You'll see more Tenryou Commission members as you go further along. We're all here for the same duty.
Hideo: ...Isn't this a little excessive?
Okabayashi: Sir Kujou holds Lady Hiiragi in the highest regard and wants to treat her with the utmost respect from beginning to end.
Hideo: I understand... Sorry to disturb your work.
Hideo: Drat. It's exactly as Master feared.
Hideo: They say they're here to guard the road, but really they're poised to attack if Master doesn't allow Lady Hiiragi to leave Ritou...
Hideo: Wait, no... If Lady Hiiragi does leave, they'll have all the more reason to strike... But we're in no state to defend against a Tenryou Commission attack!
Hideo: I must tell Master right away!
Paimon: He ran off again...
Traveler: He looked like he'd seen a ghost.
Kamisato Ayato: That should do it, the seeds have been sown. In this atmosphere, mounting suspicion will nurture fear among the Kanjou Commission.
Kamisato Ayato: Now, we wait patiently for it to grow and ferment. The calm before the storm is always the part that unsettles people the most.
Paimon: Are they really gonna own up and apologize, just like that?
Kamisato Ayato: If you're curious to find out, you can visit the Hiiragi Clan in Ritou in a couple of days.
Kamisato Ayato: I have some other business to attend to. So I won't be spending any more time on this situation.
Kamisato Ayato: In any case, we've made our move. It's only a matter of time before they give up and surrender.
Traveler: Why are you so confident?
Kamisato Ayato: This is not my first time.
Kamisato Ayato: Well, then. Goodbye for now. I truly hope that things will work out in Hiiragi Chisato's best interests.
Paimon: He left kind of abruptly... Are things really gonna turn out like he predicted?
Traveler: Let's keep an eye on things until the end.
Paimon: Paimon too! Well, let's go to Ritou again in two days!
Traveler: I'm still a little worried about Hiiragi Chisato.
Traveler: Now he realizes how serious this situation is.
