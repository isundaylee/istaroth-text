# Autumn's Gift

A musical toy sold at Bertin's House of Curiosities. It is very popular among children. This one appears to have been bought a long while back and is no longer the latest model available in the store.
Presents are for sending to people, and if they cannot be sent to their original destination, then let them at least be left with one who will treasure them.
