## Talk 5

Drusus: Oh, this is a good one...
Traveler: Are you working on your riddles again?
Drusus: Traveler! You've come at the right time! I'm about to design a whole new series of riddles.
Drusus: The terrain here is a little complicated. See, there is a huge root of the Divine Tree entering the water from one side of the harbor.
Drusus: On the other side is a huge lotus leaf, and a lot of ships waiting to leave the harbor.
Drusus: Traveler, which side do you feel is better as the theme for this riddle?
Traveler: It's better to start with the root system.
Drusus: Really? The huge root system of the Divine Tree is quite conspicuous, and easily seen as the "entry point" of the riddle.
Drusus: Okay! I'll write a riddle with the root system as the theme.
Traveler: Hehe, let me write something.
Traveler: Hehe, leave it to me.
Paimon: Hey! Why are you grinning like that!?
Traveler: Done. Here, have a look.
Drusus: "Where knowledge returns to the sea, treasure lies along the sails."
Drusus: It reads well! And this riddle also makes people think of "port" really easily...
Drusus: And when it's put with "where knowledge returns to the sea," it's easy to see that the location is related to the Akademiya or Sumeru City...
Drusus: I never knew you had such a talent.
Drusus: Wait a minute, I'll paste this riddle in a place where it can be easily discovered...
Paimon: Huh? Paste it in this area? But the location in the riddle is not that far away. It might be solved right away.
Drusus: Hahaha, I'm giving the riddle solver a range to solve the riddles in.
Drusus: If I don't do this, then the range will be too big.
Black Screen Text: Drusus starts putting up the riddle...
Drusus: Okay, the riddle for this area is done. Let's go to the next place.
Paimon: Eh? There's another place...?
Traveler: The lotus leaf and ships are interesting.
Drusus: Indeed... It could be fun in another sense if we link the two.
Drusus: No problem, I'll just make a riddle with this theme.
Traveler: These are too easy!
Drusus: Too easy? What ideas do you have then?

## Talk 6

Board With a Riddle: "Thoughts flow freely, and wisdom halts on the shore, pondering."

## Talk 7

Board With a Riddle: "The green umbrella gazes at the pearl curtain."

## Talk 8

Drusus: Okay! Let's set up the second riddle here. Once this riddle is solved, the final chest can be found.
Drusus: I'm going to place the final treasure... there.
Paimon: Huh...
Traveler: Um...
Paimon: Isn't this just an ordinary little hill with an ordinary little waterfall next to it?
Drusus: That's right! But it will soon be anything but ordinary because of our riddles.
Drusus: Okay, Traveler, what do you suggest for this riddle?
Traveler: Let's make it a bit straightforward this time...
Drusus: Eh? You think so? Hm... True, the riddle solvers would be pretty tired when they get here...
Drusus: Alright, straightforward it is.
Traveler: Not exactly trained for it...
Traveler: Well, practice makes perfect...
Drusus: I see. As expected of the Traveler! How knowledgeable... Okay, I will put up the riddle you wrote here.
Black Screen Text: Drusus starts putting up the riddle...
Drusus: Done! This little notice board should be obvious enough.
Drusus: Then let's go set up the last treasure chest now.
Traveler: Let's use the waterfall as a theme.
Drusus: Hmm... The waterfall is indeed a very clear theme.
Drusus: No problem, let's use it as a theme. As for the difficulty of this last riddle... Let's tone it down a bit.
Traveler: Hehe, let me write something.
Paimon: Hey! You're laughing more and more!
Traveler: It's done.
Drusus: "The green umbrella gazes at the pearl curtain."
Drusus: Hm... This riddle sounds special... Did you learn this from somewhere?

## Talk 9

Drusus: This is the last chest. There's no need for riddles for this one.
Drusus: But what should I put in it...
Traveler: Something valuable enough.
Drusus: That makes sense. The content of this chest should be at least worthy of the riddle solver's hard thinking along their journey.
Drusus: Speaking of value, the most logical would be Mora, of course. Ah, I'll just put some Mora in there...
Drusus: Okay, this set of riddles is finished now. Thank you for your help, Traveler.
Drusus: These are for you, as a reward.
Drusus: *sigh* I was planning on discussing riddles with you in more depth, but I have to return to the Akademiya to tend to some matters first.
Drusus: If you discover any strange new riddles in your travels, or get stumped by one, please come to me by all means.
Drusus: We can discuss them in detail together, then... Put together new riddles for other adventurers! Hahaha!
Drusus: Farewell, Traveler. I wish you safe travels.
Drusus: I hope that Treasure Hoarder named Narzam won't cause any serious trouble...
Traveler: Something of practical value.
Drusus: Practical value? Hm... What can be of enough practical value?
Drusus: Oh right! I got a recipe from someone a few days ago. Let's put it in this chest as a reward.
Traveler: This process of thought is the greatest treasure.
Drusus: Hahahahaha! You're right! So true! The thinking process is indeed a priceless and valuable experience! Compared to it, other things are almost worthless.
Paimon: That's simply not true! Put some Mora in it, or a recipe! Some vegetables or fruits at the very least, don't put nothing!
Drusus: I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I'll definitely put something in as a reward.
