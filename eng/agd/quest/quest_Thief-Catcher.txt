# Thief-Catcher


## Talk 1

Cyrus: Hmph. It's high time we took care of these crooks...
Traveler: What's going on?
Cyrus: When that storm from before had just appeared, the Knights and the Adventurers' Guild sprang into action.
Cyrus: But as we were busy with evacuation and rescue work, it seems as though some Treasure Hoarders managed to sneak in amid the chaos.
Cyrus: These thieves took advantage of that moment when we were stretched thin, and managed to steal quite a few things throughout the city.
Cyrus: Carrots from the Dawn Winery, Philanemo Mushrooms from Springvale, a stack of silverware from the Goth Grand Hotel... Hmph, they've even stolen some of the food stocked in the Good Hunter's larder.
Cyrus: If it's not nailed down, these bandits will take it. Why, if this storm hadn't subsided so quickly, I doubt there'd be anything left in Mondstadt to steal.
Cyrus: We've got enough hands on deck again, but looking for those things may prove very difficult. The speed at which they flee with their loot is only surpassed by their ability to fence it.
Cyrus: Still, we must make them pay.
Cyrus: Honorary Knight. If you're willing, would you like to have a little chat with those Treasure Hoarders?

## Talk 2

Traveler: Wouldn't miss it for the world.
Cyrus: Good! A fine answer, worthy of your title.
Cyrus: Then I shall leave this matter to you. We have caught the trail of a group of Treasure Hoarders around the city. I will mark it down on your map.
Cyrus: But they are a wily bunch. It would take you some effort to completely clear their camps out.
Cyrus: But for an Honorary Knight like you, it should be a simple matter.

## Talk 3

Traveler: I'd love to, but...
Cyrus: Ah, is that so... It's fine. You are the Honorary Knight, after all, I should think that there are many other things that you have to attend to throughout the city.

## Talk 4

Cyrus: Hmph, these Treasure Hoarders... What a persistent pack of rats they are.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Cyrus: You're back. Have you wiped their camps out yet?
Traveler: Got them all.
Cyrus: As I thought, it was child's play for you, Honorary Knight.
Cyrus: I will admit that these Treasure Hoarders are quite persistent. Everyone was running for cover during the storm. They, by contrast, had the daring to run out and steal things.
Cyrus: If only they had used that perseverance for something proper instead...
