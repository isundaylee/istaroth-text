Traveler: Won't you be lonely here all by yourself?
Trow: Hmm? Not at all.
Trow: Sometimes, many people come here, and the place is incredibly crowded. At other times, it is just like it is now, empty as can be.
Trow: Reminds you of the tides lapping against the shore, doesn't it?
Trow: And with these tides for company, I'm not lonesome at all.
