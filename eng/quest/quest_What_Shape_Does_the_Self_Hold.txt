# What Shape Does the Self Hold


## Talk 1

Paimon: We finally managed to rescue it...
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: It should be the life-form from the prophecy.
Nahida: That light...
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: !
Paimon: Wait, something dark is coming out... Something's not right!
Traveler: Everyone, back up.
Paimon: What's going on? Didn't Nahida say it was purified?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Maybe it's because such a long amount of time has passed.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Although the power of the Oozing Filth is more stable than that of the apocalypse, it is still a form of dangerous power.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: It might have lost its mind after being soaked in it for such a long time.
Paimon: Oh no... but we still have tons of questions we need to ask.
Nahida: I should be able to purge it with my elemental power.
Traveler: Wait, don't do it!
Nahida: But this is our only chance.
Traveler: I said no, and I mean it.
Traveler: We can't go through that again.
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}...
Traveler: I'm sorry, I got a little anxious.
Nahida: It's okay... I trust your judgment. I was being a little hasty myself. Let's see if we can think of another way.
Traveler: What about the crystal...?
Paimon: Oh, yeah! You said that the elemental power in the crystal was identical to theirs.
Nahida: You want to use its power? But...
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: The Lord of Dendro seems hesitant. I too, would advise caution.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: It's risky to use its power without fully understanding its intended use.
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: Don't understand. This no good... That no good... Save life... important.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Yes, I understand, but this is our only chance to return home. We cannot afford to be careless.
Nahida: It's okay, there's no need to argue. I'll think of something to do about the elemental power that will be used.
Nahida: #Hmm, how about this... {NICKNAME}, you could try using it.
Nahida: I understand that you have an amazing resistance to forbidden knowledge.
Traveler: Sure thing.
Paimon: #Don't overdo it, {NICKNAME}. Paimon will be worried!
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: ...
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: Ugh...
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: Lord of Dendro... and you others... How long... How long have I been waiting here?
Paimon: Yay! Looks like it worked!
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: The Lord of Dendro, here in person... Does that mean... the apocalypse has come to an end?
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: Wait, did you... get smaller again?
Nahida: I'm sorry, that portion of my memory is highly unreliable at the moment... I can't seem to remember who you are...
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: Hmm, that sounds about right. After all, the purpose of my existence is precisely for those "unreliable" memories you speak of.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: You once said that the apocalypse will be completely eradicated and that relevant memories will become unstable.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: Even you couldn't promise that you'd remember our agreement after those events take place.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: However, you are definitely someone who stays true to your word. My sacrifice is nothing compared to your resolve.
Nahida: You and I made the agreement?
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: Yes. You used your power to protect me. That is the reason why I was able to survive here.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: To be honest, I'm nearing my end... I had thought I'd be stronger than this.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: No one can withstand the power of the apocalypse.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: In order to preserve a somewhat stable memory, I had to change the power of the apocalypse into a different form.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: Only the giant spike that fell from the sky was capable of doing something like that. But the moment I chose to go through with it...
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: Is the moment I lost my chance of being rescued by the Lord of Dendro...
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: But enough about me. Lord of Dendro, let's get to the important matter at hand. As you can see... I won't last much longer...
Nahida: I understand, and I'm sorry. But...
Nahida: Can you please tell me what this is?
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: This... is a Fire Seed. It's an essential item for saving the Dendro Dragon. Thankfully, it appears to be in good condition.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: The Lord of Dendro and our people created this item together. It mimics how the Dendro Dragon's "Heart of Oasis" operates.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: The Dendro Dragon has been tormented by the apocalypse for far too long. It too is nearing the end of its power.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: However, if you are able to reactivate its Heart of Oasis using the Fire Seed, then the Dendro Dragon will begin to recover.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: And as a result, our homeland will return to the way it once was.
Nahida: So the Heart of Oasis is Apep's source of power...
Paimon: No wonder the crystal was able to heal this Fungus just now. That's what it's used for.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: What?
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: You used... the Fire Seed to save me?
Paimon: Mm-hmm. Why? What's wrong?
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: That's... Uh, never mind, it's not your fault. You didn't know.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: The Fire Seed contains a high concentration of elemental power inside of it. It's very powerful yet fragile at the same time.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: It is not stable in its current form. To prevent any accidents, please don't use it again.
Nahida: Since I am its creator, I will take responsibility for it. I assure you there's no need to worry.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: Alright. Aside from being able to heal the Dendro Dragon, the Fire Seed can also resonate with the Heart of Oasis.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: In other words, you'll be able to find the Dendro Dragon by following the guidance of the Fire Seed.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: But you should hurry, there is little time to waste.
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: What... about you?
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: Forget about me. You should hurry home now.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Everyone is returning home, including you.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: As I told you, I've already lost my chance to be saved by the Lord of Dendro.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: Lord of Dendro, I thank you for coming to find me and for being willing to save the Dendro Dragon.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: Our past has been saved, and our future has been ensured.
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: It's enough for me just knowing that they will return home.
Paimon: Hey... wait!
Paimon: It turned into... Oozing Filth.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Can you use the Lumenstone once more? I can still feel its elemental power.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Please... Of all of us, it deserves the chance to return home the most.
Traveler: Okay.
Nahida: This is a small ball of light that it left behind...
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: I can feel it... I can feel its knowledge and emotions... It has all returned to its original elemental form and is becoming one with the other family members.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Do not be sad, my friends. Its wish has come true and it's very happy right now.
Nahida: Because its external form doesn't matter, right?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Yes, because our external form does not matter, and our home has been saved. There is nothing more important than being together with family.
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: Let's go. Home.
Nahida: Home...
Traveler: This is definitely connected to forbidden knowledge.

## Talk 3

Paimon: We won't be able to see anything if we keep going that way.
Paimon: Hey, look! Something's over there!
Nahida: We've found it... Apep, the Dendro Dragon.
Paimon: Paimon knew it would be big, but... not THAT big!
Apep: Puny god, puny human... Leave my domain.
Apep: Frail life-forms like you cannot survive in the endless sands of the desert.
Nahida: Apep, we're here to save you.
Apep: I do not need saving. Especially not by you, Buer.
Apep: You are no different from Amun. Both of you have only existed for a fraction of what you know as time, yet you call yourselves lords of this land by leaning on the heavens' glow.
Apep: You're better off paying attention to your path ahead, as you will fall where you've fallen before.
Nahida: I know that you hate both gods and humans, but you've grown too weak now. Can't you let go of your hatred, even for only a moment?
Apep: Let go... for only a moment?
Apep: Foolish Buer. You will find no gratefulness from me, even if you heal me.
Apep: You will only be reviving the dragon that will destroy Sumeru and the seven nations!
Nahida: No. You're ill, that's all.
Apep: That I am. Time will bring death to all, it's unavoidable. Although I am gravely ill, my mind remains clear.
Apep: I am different from the ancient dragons that came to terms with you!
Nahida: There's no need for this. There is no point in fighting, what we need is the truth.
Apep: Hmph. "The truth"... the shackles that the God of Wisdom cannot escape from.
Apep: I have paid dearly for the truth, and you shall do the same soon enough.
Paimon: Hey, don't leave!
Nahida: Careful! Something's coming!
Paimon: Wahh! What is that? Paimon's never seen that before!
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: It's our family.
Paimon: Huh? They're your family too!? But they don't look anything like Fungi!
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: External form... not important. Inner nature... same.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: The composition of their elemental power is identical to ours. In other words, they're residents of our homeland.
Nahida: Is this what they've become after experiencing the apocalypse?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: This is also a form of adaptation, although a most gruesome and pitiful one. Many of our family members never made it out of the Dendro Dragon...
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: They've gradually taken this form in order to survive the apocalypse.
Nahida: Is there any way to avoid fighting them?
Paimon: Hey, can you guys talk? We're here to rescue you!
Unknown NPC (13221): ...
Traveler: They're not responding.
Nahida: They've given it their all just to survive.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: They're being drawn by the Fire Seed. Only its power can temporarily free them from their pain.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: All that remains are the instincts to survive and search for energy needed to do so. Everything else has been discarded in the process of adaptation.
Paimon: So this is the result of forbidden knowledge...
Nahida: Would our world become the same if the forbidden knowledge was allowed to rampage across Teyvat...?
Nahida: Like fish struggling on land... unable to find a single puddle of fresh water in the entire world...
Traveler: We can talk about this later.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Yes. But please, try to be gentle with them. They are not evil in nature... All they want to do is survive.
Traveler: Let's deal with them first.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Paimon thinks they've used up all their strength! They don't seem aggressive anymore...
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: They... want to... go home.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Yes, it was never their intention to leave the Dendro Dragon.
Nahida: Is there a way to make them revert to their elemental form?
Nahida: Years of torment is what turned them into their current state. Their external form has become their shackles...
Nahida: It seems only the Fire Seed or Apep's Heart of Oasis can save them.
Nahida: But it'll be risky if we use the Fire Seed again.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Correct, we cannot use the Fire Seed again.
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: Everyone... goes... home. Not just... us.
Paimon: Aw, this is becoming quite the dilemma...
Nahida: Let me think for a second.
Nahida: It's fine, let's use the power of the Fire Seed. I can't bear leaving them in the desert like this.
Traveler: But...
Nahida: Don't worry. The decision is on me, I'll take responsibility for whatever happens.
Nahida: It won't require much elemental power. I'm just worried that it'll become unstable.
Nahida: But as long as I use my elemental power to stabilize it a little, it shouldn't be a problem.
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: Thank you... Sorry... stubborn.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Thank you, Lord of Dendro.
Nahida: Returning home is the most important thing to you. I've come to understand that during our travels.
Nahida: I'm not doing this just to protect you, but also because I hope to use you and your experience and try speaking to Apep again.
Nahida: After all, that giant Dendro Dragon is also your family. Maybe it would listen.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: I will stand with you, Lord of Dendro. I will never forget your kindness.
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: Yes... yes...
Nahida: Thank you. Alright, here it goes.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Family... We will all be able to go home soon.
Paimon: Woah! It's shining now!
Traveler: It's getting bigger...
Elemental Being: Grounded Hydroshroom: Endless amounts of knowledge and emotions are moving inside of me. They're all very excited.
Elemental Being: Grounded Hydroshroom: To imagine such growth could be achieved in such a short period of time...
Paimon: It's because you're carrying everyone's hopes and dreams.
Elemental Being: Grounded Hydroshroom: Yes, finally... we can go home.
Nahida: This is the last part. Let's go.

## Talk 7

Paimon: This cave is huge! Could this be where the Dendro Dragon lives?
Traveler: We can't go any further.
Paimon: Yeah... Who knows what's inside that cave...
Nahida: Our goal is not only to find the dragon, but to also enter the world inside of it.
Nahida: That will be impossible if we can't get it to cooperate with us.
Paimon: But how are we gonna do that? It doesn't seem to want to help at all.
Nahida: I'll see what I can do.
Nahida: Apep, I know we don't see eye to eye, and that we have a very different understanding of the world and its orders.
Nahida: However, we are both born of elemental power and both suffered the torment of forbidden knowledge.
Nahida: We are not that different. And right now, we share a common enemy. We should not let our differences get in the way.
Paimon: Hmm, wonder if the Dendro Dragon's even willing to listen...
Nahida: I don't care about what you believe in, who you hate, or what you've done in the name of hatred... Nor do I expect you to be grateful.
Nahida: I'm here to save both you and your people. My people.
Nahida: They've been searching for a way to save you ever since they left their homeland. They yearn for a chance to return home.
Nahida: And now that everything is over, all the hatred that you harbor has lost its meaning. Rather than continuing to fight, you should consider the life you've produced.
Nahida: ...
Elemental Being: Grounded Hydroshroom: No response...
Nahida: Your eagerness to survive means that you haven't given up on that world yet!
Nahida: If you claim to know so much more than I, then why don't you truly think about why you want to survive... and why you're so vengeful!
Nahida: ...
Traveler: Still no good...
Paimon: Wh—Whaaaa! Paimon is getting sucked in!
Traveler: Hurry, grab on to me!
Nahida: Please, keep everyone safe...
Nahida: And send us to the "homeland"!

Paimon: Ugh... Hmm?
Paimon: Nahida, where are we...?
Paimon: #Huh? And what about {NICKNAME}? Where'd {M#he}{F#she} go!?
Nahida: I was only able to ensure that we made it here safely. It's possible we arrived at different locations...
Paimon: Hmm... Well, then let's go have a look up ahead. Paimon's feeling really worried...
Nahida: #Yep, let's go. I wouldn't worry too much, {NICKNAME}'s no pushover.
Paimon: Paimon knows that! It's just that Paimon isn't used to not having the Traveler around...
Paimon: #Let's hurry! {M#He}{F#She} might be just up ahead.

## Talk 10

Floating Anemo Fungus: ...?

## Talk 11

Paimon: What's that!?
Nahida: That should be the Heart of Oasis. All we need to do is "light" it with the Fire Seed and it'll restore Apep with elemental power.
Nahida: The damage it suffered internally will also slowly begin to heal.
Paimon: #Then let's hurry and light it! We still need to find {NICKNAME}!
Nahida: Alright. Hang on...
Nahida: Oh...
Paimon: Wait, the Fire Seed! What happened?
Nahida: It shattered...
Nahida: It was even more unstable than I expected.
Paimon: But why!? We barely used it!
Nahida: I'm not sure. Perhaps the Fire Seed was only capable of protecting one person...?
Nahida: But if I didn't use its power on everyone, there's no way of knowing where you could have been sucked into.
Nahida: And even if that's the case... There's no reason for it to simply shatter... Unless...
Paimon: Unless what?
Nahida: Unless I was already in a weakened state when I created this Fire Seed...
Nahida: Which would be when we had first saved the desert.
Paimon: Oh no...
Paimon: Wait, let's put that aside for a moment!
Paimon: If the Fire Seed has shattered, wouldn't that mean we came all this way for nothing!?
Paimon: *sigh* Do you know what we should do now, Nahida? C'mon, Paimon, think...!
Nahida: I... *sigh*
Nahida: Don't worry, Paimon. This is my responsibility. The Fire Seed is technically just a ball of highly concentrated elemental power.
Nahida: Although my elemental power is slightly different than that of elemental life-forms, I gained a better understanding of it when I turned into a Fungus.
Nahida: So, all I have to do is imitate that power while adding some of my own, and I'll be able to do what the Fire Seed was supposed to...
Paimon: You're... gonna become the Fire Seed?
Nahida: Yes. It'll take a lot of power from me, but it still won't be anything compared to when I was in the desert...
Nahida: I might, however... become even smaller.
Paimon: What happens if you keep getting smaller?
Nahida: I'll become a blade of grass or a twig. Basically, I'll return to how I was first born.
Nahida: I will be able to unleash power beyond my limits if I can reverse the process of growth.
Paimon: But you'll lose everything! You'll not only lose your appearance, but you'll lose your emotions, memories, and who knows what else!
Nahida: That's alright. None of that matters compared to the dangers that Apep is facing right now.
Paimon: No, no, wait! There has to be another way! Besides, what will Sumeru do if you turn into a twig!?
Nahida: #Maybe you and {NICKNAME} can plant me in the soil of Sumeru once it is all over.
Nahida: I can still communicate with the world through the forest. It's just that you won't be able to see me for some time...
Paimon: You can't be serious...!
Paimon: #If {NICKNAME} were here, {M#he}{F#she} definitely wouldn't let you go through with it!
Paimon: If we knew this was how you were going to "take responsibility," then we never would've agreed in the first place!
Nahida: I'm sorry, Paimon. But we're out of options.
Nahida: Not all eagles who have fallen to the ground can soar in the sky once again. But if no risks are taken, then the eagle will be grounded forever.
Paimon: No! Please no, Nahida!

## Talk 12

Paimon: Hey! Can you hear Paimon!? Say something!
Paimon: You Fungi said that your form didn't matter, right? Then let us know that you're all right...!
Traveler: That's enough, Paimon.
Apep: Their knowledge, memories, and emotions have been reverted to elemental power and released. They are no longer able to respond to you.
Apep: The guardians that have accompanied me for countless eras have also transformed into my elemental power, just as they did.
Apep: They will be born once again now that they're one. There's nothing to be sad about.
Paimon: But that's different! They won't ever be the same...
Nahida: Paimon, we will never understand it, and it will never understand us. That's how it's destined to be.
Nahida: But as long as you can be healthy again, then nothing else matters to me, Apep.
Nahida: Sumeru will be free from threat as long as your health is maintained.
Apep: I thought that my rage would be kindled once my power returned to me.
Apep: However, what I feel now is a feeling that has long eluded me... the feeling of "peace."
Nahida: The forbidden knowledge influenced you ever since you were contaminated, greatly amplifying your hatred and rage.
Apep: Yes... there's no denying that. Although my hatred for that usurper from beyond the heavens still stirs deep within me, destroying you and your people serves me no purpose.
Apep: Be that as it may, my position still stands, and I will have nothing to do with you.
Apep: When you inevitably perish due to your ever-expanding curiosity, I will still sneer and mock you in my heart.
Paimon: Yeesh, who can put up with you?
Nahida: I respect your decision, and with time, I will prove to you that we will not repeat our mistakes.
Nahida: Before you begin resting, there is one last thing I would like to know.
Nahida: How did you become affected by forbidden knowledge?
Apep: It's a long story... We all once believed in the distant past that only forbidden knowledge could give us enough power to defeat the Heavenly Principles.
Apep: The Drago{RUBY#[S]Nibelung}n King acquired the power of darkness from outside of this world and led us in a fight against the order established by the outsiders.
Paimon: D—Dragon King!?
Apep: An unimaginable war took place in Teyvat, causing destruction on an unprecedented scale. The world itself was on the verge of collapse.
Apep: In war, the victor would inherit the right to shape the world, while the losers must turn into ash...
Apep: But I didn't give up on searching for a way to turn the tides, even after the death of the Dragon King.
Apep: As I attempted to collect more forbidden knowledge from the corners of the world as it was on the verge of collapse... I was stopped by the giant spike that fell from the sky.
Apep: Sand dunes arose where there was only forest, and it was as if even Sumeru itself was trying to tell me that the era of the dragons was over.
Nahida: But you still didn't give up, did you? Because of Amun... Al-Ahmar.
Apep: Yes. Al-Ahmar eventually obtained this power
with the help of Nabu M{RUBY#[S]The Goddess of Flowers}alikata.
Apep: His ambitions continued to grow, and he planned to establish a powerful kingdom in my domain.
Apep: Although I didn't think much of him, I allowed his actions under one condition...
Apep: The condition was that after his death, all the knowledge he came to accumulate would belong to me.
Apep: At that time, I still harbored deep regrets. By the time the Dragon King finally returned, the world had irrevocably changed.
Apep: Some of the dragons have grown close to your kind and have forgotten all about our hatred from when the world was taken from us.
Apep: And some died, leaving behind nothing but their bones, while others chose to flee after experiencing pain and agony...
Apep: But for me, the scales and will of the Dragon King still shine bright in my heart even to this day.
Apep: I will follow them until the end of my time.
Nahida: You really are insane...
Apep: When Al-Ahmar's proud kingdom collapsed, I swallowed him whole as I agreed and absorbed his elemental power.
Apep: However, what I gained was no benefit... No, I gained the apocalypse.
Apep: I used up all my strength just trying to keep the pain under control... I had no energy to analyze the knowledge he had accumulated...
Apep: But even then, I still believe that his insanity was far greater than that of my own.
Paimon: So that's how the apocalypse started...
Apep: I admit that I fell for his trap. I was like a final fail-safe in his plan.
Apep: Tiny Buer, and the rest of you... continue forward. I shall keep a watchful eye.
Apep: How far will the life so dear and precious to the Heavenly Principles be able to go? I wonder...
Traveler: I know you're sad.

Paimon: Hey! Looks like we've been sent back out... Still in one piece, too!
Nahida: The dragon will need to rest for a very long time before it is fully healthy again.
Nahida: It's not as ruthless as it was before. Curing the dragon of its illness has seemingly made it more open to reason.
Paimon: Nobody's in a good mood when they're feeling sick!
Paimon: Even though we accomplished something really important, Paimon still doesn't feel happy for some reason.
Traveler: Bringing everyone home was supposed to be a happy occasion.
Nahida: Indeed, although they'll still have the chance to be born again, they've lost their memories of their journey and their feelings for their homeland.
Nahida: Each opportunity for growth is unique in its own way.
Nahida: Perhaps the immense power we released was the pouring out of all these irreplaceable emotions that had built up over time.
Paimon: Can you really call a place with no family your home...?
Nahida: Family... Right! The Hydro Fungus left behind its family.
Nahida: Those two Fungi might be waiting for it to return.
Paimon: Oh, yeah! Let's hurry and go take a look. How are we going to explain all the complicated things that happened...?
Traveler: But it seems to have lost some of its meaning.

## Talk 15

Paimon: They're still here! Have they really been waiting here all this time?
Nahida: We're back!
Floating Hydro Fungus: ♪~
Floating Hydro Fungus: ...?
Nahida: I'm sorry, I really am... But it's gone home and won't be able to return for a very long time.
Floating Hydro Fungus: !!!
Nahida: Don't be sad. It did it to protect you. Your happiness is more important to it than anything else in the world.
Nahida: It said that "Nur" is its most important family member.
Nahida: That's your name, isn't it?
Floating Hydro Fungus: ...
Floating Hydro Fungus: ...
Floating Hydro Fungus: N... Nur...
Paimon: Whoa!
Nahida: This is wonderful... So it has left traces of itself after all.
Nahida: They will definitely meet again, someday.

## Talk 16

Paimon: So that elemental life-form came all the way here on its own and spent a long time by itself?
Paimon: Wouldn't it already have become The Withering like the others...?
Nahida: There is a chance that it could avoid that end, using the power of something here...
Nahida: I'm referring to what was used to fight against the Abyss. It once repaired the rifts of Teyvat long ago.
Nahida: It has the ability to purify and stabilize powers that shouldn't exist in Teyvat.
Nahida: Forbidden knowledge that its light has shone upon is kept here forever in a different form...
Traveler: You mean... the Oozing Filth?
Nahida: Yup. It's just like soap bubbles that rise to the water's surface.
Paimon: Uh, another strange metaphor... But Paimon somehow gets this one.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: What the Lord of Dendro means is that the apocalypse was altered by the power of the giant spike and hidden within the Oozing Filth.
Nahida: Yes, and it shouldn't be far from here. Let's go and take a look.
