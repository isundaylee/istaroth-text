## Talk

Muirne: Hello there. Here to check out the ocean view as well?

## Talk

Traveler: You're...
Muirne: My name's Muirne. You can just call me Muirne.
Muirne: Huh. I think I repeated myself there. Sorry, hehe...
Muirne: Looking at the sea brings a lot of things to my heart, and my mind moves slower, too.

Traveler: Could I join you?
Muirne: Sure you can. The view here's really nice, by the way.

Traveler: What's on your mind?
Muirne: A lot of things. Sometimes I think of more and more things, and I stand for longer periods of time.
Muirne: Once, Monsieur Neuvillette saw me watching the sea, and he stood beside me in deep thought.
Muirne: And slowly, more and more people started gathering behind us.
Muirne: Everyone was tiptoeing to watch the sea, muttering to themselves, "is something happening out there?"
Muirne: Humans are so cute.
Muirne: But in truth, the thing I was considering was very simple. It's an everyday thing â€” what am I going to eat later?

## Talk

Traveler: I'm starting to think, too...
Muirne: Now that we're talking about food, let me give this to you. Take it and you won't need to worry anymore.
