Qiqi: Our kite is so high up.
Qiqi: Thank you for inviting me, Yaoyao. I am having... a lot of fun.
Yaoyao: I'm glad!
Yaoyao: If you want, we can go fly kites some other time too. The fun doesn't have to end today!
Qiqi: Really?
Yaoyao: How about we do it during the day next time? That way, we can see the design better! When it flies super high up, it will look exactly like a real finch.
Qiqi: Okay.
Qiqi: Can I... take this kite to bed with me?
Yaoyao: Hehe, but of course!
