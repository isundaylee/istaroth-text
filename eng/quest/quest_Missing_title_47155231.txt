# Missing title (47155231)

Traveler: I've got some treasure I want to sell.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Eh? Well, to tell you the truth, we've managed to restore a regular supply of goods, and we don't really make collecting odds and ends a habit, in any case...
Mikoshi Genichirou: But just from looking at you, I think it's safe to assume that it's something most interesting indeed.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Well... Why don't you let me have a look at it, then?
Black Screen Text: You tell Mikoshi Genichirou about the Dragonbone Orb.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Hmm...
Mikoshi Genichirou: I'll be honest with you. While this is quite the curious tale, it does seem a bit too out there...
Mikoshi Genichirou: This object falls somewhat outside my area of expertise.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Please, don't scoff. I am but a mere craftsman myself...
Mikoshi Genichirou: How about this, then? 80,000 and 5 Sashimi Platters. Those dishes aren't cheap by any means, mind you.
Mikoshi Genichirou: If you agree to this price, I will buy this treasure.
Traveler: ...What will you use it for?
Mikoshi Genichirou: I'm not sure at the moment. I'll need to give it some thought.
Mikoshi Genichirou: If the situation is right, I might be able to modify this into a special netsuke and sell it for a decent price.
Traveler: A fair price. Done.
Mikoshi Genichirou: In that case, please take this Mora. As for me, I'm going to go look into this item.
Traveler: Let me think about it a bit more.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Fair enough. I need to give this a little thought myself.
Mikoshi Genichirou: You can come to me again once you've thought things over.
