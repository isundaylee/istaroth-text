Tea Master Liu Su: That's amazing. You're the first to defeat me this way.

## Talk

Tea Master Liu Su: When even a horse of a thousand miles can stumble, you too can run out of luck, hahaha.

## Talk

Tea Master Liu Su: ...Well, it looks like it's not a good day to play cards, so I'd better pack up and go on stage.

## Talk

Tea Master Liu Su: As the saying goes, "you win some, you lose some." Don't be discouraged by this. Next time, if you are interested, I will play a few rounds with you.

## Talk

Traveler: Can you tell another story?
Tea Master Liu Su: Another one? But I was just getting to the good part in The Wrath of Haishan...
Tea Master Liu Su: I'll tell you what, I was going to narrate this one some time soon, it's Legend of the Shattered Halberd. If you're that desperate for a new story, you can take it.
Tea Master Liu Su: But I must say, reading a book can't compare to the experience of having it narrated to you by a professional orator. So I would encourage you to come and listen in some time.

## Talk

Tea Master Liu Su: Tragically, the Grand Master of the Guhua Brotherhood then ate that fateful date, and the stone became lodged in his throat... He bravely fought for his life deep into the night until, finally, the hero of a generation became a legend for all time...

## Talk

Traveler: (Listen in)
Tea Master Liu Su: ...For those that wish to listen, I shall now proceed with the tale of The Crux's death-defying struggle against the wrath of the ocean.
Tea Master Liu Su: The name of the young lady who served as The Crux's captain was Beidou... She stood six-foot-tall and was built burlier than the burliest man you've ever seen! She was clad in fiery red clothing from head to foot, and had a fierce look in her eyes that pierced like lightning...
Tea Master Liu Su: Does this sound like an ordinary person to you? ...No? You're absolutely right! Beidou was indeed no ordinary person...
Tea Master Liu Su: ...But without further ado, let us dive deep into the details of Beidou's legendary battle against the formidable sea monster, Haishan!
Traveler: (Keep listening)
Tea Master Liu Su: ...Beidou was a force to be reckoned with. She pulled Haishan towards her with her left hand as she clenched her right hand into a fist and prepared to strike:
Tea Master Liu Su: "You will rue the day you dared to challenge The Crux!"
Tea Master Liu Su: Beidou roared with rage as she slammed her fist into Haishan's face with the force of an iron mace. Haishan's head tore open and blood oozed out, turning the sea red as far as the eye could see!
Tea Master Liu Su: Haishan, that colossal whale, had never seen such a thing in all the seven seas! Struggling with all his might, he broke free and turned to dive back into the ocean depths...
Traveler: Wow!
Tea Master Liu Su: ...In a flash, Beidou disappeared without a trace beneath the billowing waves.
Tea Master Liu Su: As the crew looked out upon the crimson-colored ocean, there was no telling Haishan's blood from that of Beidou... Fear for the fate of their captain coursed through their veins, but they dared not act in haste...
Tea Master Liu Su: The stalemate dragged on, hour after hour, for the better part of the day... And then, suddenly, a deafening sound like rumbling thunder filled the skies...
Tea Master Liu Su: I trust you all wish to know how the story proceeds? Listen closely, for all will be revealed in the next chapter...

Tea Master Liu Su: The Crux's death-defying struggle against the ocean's wrath...

## Talk

Tea Master Liu Su: But alas! The Master was stricken down with disease, never again to hold his sword. The Guhua Clan, now leaderless and helpless, was henceforth laid low...
Tea Master Liu Su: What a pity! What a shame! A gallant company of heroes, washed away by the cruel tide of fate!

## Talk

Traveler: (Listen in)
Tea Master Liu Su: If you will excuse my clumsy tongue and inelegant speech, I will again tell the tale of that legendary old name of Chihu Rock — the Wanmin Restaurant.
Tea Master Liu Su: What does the Wanmin Restaurant do, I hear you ask? Why, delicacies of all shapes, sizes and styles. Though of these, they are best known for their spicy dishes.
Tea Master Liu Su: They say that when that something truly spicy hits your nose, for three days shall it remain there. So it is here. One bite of that flaming brew, and a thousand flavors burst forth, so many that your tongue could not find names for them!
Tea Master Liu Su: Why, if Rex Lapis were to see the sight of that blazing concoction of exquisite spices, his mouth too would water, and his eyes too would sparkle.
Traveler: (Keep listening)
Tea Master Liu Su: ...And now you may ask, who is this most brilliant head chef of Wanmin Restaurant?
Tea Master Liu Su: His name is Mao, born and bred of culinary stock.
Tea Master Liu Su: The Li and Yue cuisines he keeps in his arsenal, the delights of the seven nations under his belt. Whatever you order, he will prepare expertly, and his knife-work is nothing short of divine.
Tea Master Liu Su: Now, Chef Mao has a daughter named Xiangling, who has surpassed him by far... At but her tender age she has traversed the nations in search of famed cooks and fine food...
Traveler: Huh...
Tea Master Liu Su: Now, on a certain day, Xiangling was catching lizards in the Dihua Marsh...
Tea Master Liu Su: And ah, I can hear the question already — are lizards fit for our consumption? You have much to learn, I say!
Tea Master Liu Su: For where Xiangling differs from many a great chef is in her ability to use ingredients unlooked-for and cooking methods unknown to create gourmet dishes that break the mold.
Tea Master Liu Su: But at that moment, there was a shuffling in the weeds behind Xiangling, drawing closer, and closer and closer...
Tea Master Liu Su: ...and before you knew it, ah, it was right behind her!
Traveler: Yikes!
Tea Master Liu Su: Even at this moment, Xiangling, absorbed as she was in gathering ingredients, knew nothing of these movements.
Tea Master Liu Su: What was it? Was it friend? Or was it foe?
Tea Master Liu Su: Now, do not fret, for all will be revealed in the next chapter!
Traveler: (Stop listening)
Tea Master Liu Su: Now, on a certain day, Xiangling was catching lizards in the Dihua Marsh...

Traveler: (Stop listening)
Tea Master Liu Su: If you do not mind, dear guests, I shall say another.

## Talk

Tea Master Liu Su: Well then, dear guests, what would you all like to hear next?

## Talk

Traveler: (Listen in)
Tea Master Liu Su: Now, I shall tell you a tale of our Lady Ningguang, she who perceives and oversees all that happens among the merchants.
Tea Master Liu Su: They say that in those first days when she had just received Rex Lapis' recognition, and become the Tianquan...
Tea Master Liu Su: She saw that taxation was ossified and prejudiced, whereupon she moved like the wind, reforming the laws and punishing the corrupt.
Tea Master Liu Su: In one go, she fined several guilds heavily, and shed redundant staff like so much dead skin...
Tea Master Liu Su: Those tax-dodging merchants could not have trembled more had they tried. Oh, how the dutiful citizens — like you and I — cheered and clapped to see that sight!
Traveler: Yes!
Tea Master Liu Su: But ah, with her decisive actions, Lady Ningguang had made an enemy of that great shipping line, the Yulong Guild.
Tea Master Liu Su: The head of the Yulong Guild then was named Haiyan. A master of the wharfs he was — built like a giant and strong enough to wrestle a shark. His arms were as thick as an ancient tree, and his iron teeth could shatter stone!
Tea Master Liu Su: "The Tianquan Ningguang? Who is that? Come, I shall go and meet this little lady!"
Tea Master Liu Su: Haiyan left his seat of power all in a fury, intent on a confrontation...
Traveler: Oh no...
Tea Master Liu Su: But Haiyan had gone in for three or four hours, and still no one had heard a thing from within.
Tea Master Liu Su: Even the guards outside wondered: what strange power does Lady Ningguang's mansion have, that no sound should be heard?
Tea Master Liu Su: But before they knew it, they heard a sound like a peal of thunder. All was not well—
Tea Master Liu Su: I trust you all wish to know how the story proceeds? Listen closely, for all will be revealed in the next chapter...
Traveler: (Stop listening)
Tea Master Liu Su: But ah, with her decisive actions, Lady Ningguang had made an enemy of that great shipping line, the Yulong Guild...

Traveler: (Stop listening)
Tea Master Liu Su: Now, if I may bid you listen to another tale...

## Talk

Tea Master Liu Su: Oh? You'd like to hear more about the Guhua Brotherhood? Well then, if you all do not mind, I shall say another verse...

## Talk

Traveler: (Listen in)
Tea Master Liu Su: As you all know, the Guhua Brotherhood suffered a decline and became the Guhua Sect, and the Sect too withered and became the Guhua Clan as we know it today.
Tea Master Liu Su: Today we shall speak of a young hero of the Guhua Clan, a scholar and a swordsman.
Tea Master Liu Su: Now this young hero was dressed to impress, polite to a fault, fair-faced and keen-eyed...
Tea Master Liu Su: Wielding the sword and the scroll alike, he wandered far abroad like a visage of the Guhua Brotherhood of old...
Traveler: (Keep listening)
Tea Master Liu Su: Though the Clan had fallen far indeed, none of its members had ever ceased fighting for justice...
Tea Master Liu Su: And so one day, as the young hero passed through the stone forest of Jueyun Karst, he heard voices calling to each other through the mountain mist...
Tea Master Liu Su: The merchants with him were scared to death. It was all over — they were beset by bandits!
Tea Master Liu Su: But the hero, unflustered, unsheathed his blade, a poem on his lips...
Tea Master Liu Su: And hearing his words, the bandits in the shadows, too, were befuddled—
Traveler: Wow...
Tea Master Liu Su: "What sorcery is this lad working?"
Tea Master Liu Su: But in truth, the young hero was no thaumaturge. He spoke thus precisely in order to confound the villains while he marshaled the power of his Vision.
Tea Master Liu Su: Now, this is not well known, but the Guhua Clan's Way of the Rain Cutter is the art of forming blades out of water, countering hard blows with soft strikes.
Tea Master Liu Su: When one of these scoundrels saw the lad defenseless, he moved to strike!
Tea Master Liu Su: But before he knew it, the sound of ringing blades echoed in his ears. He looked, and behold! Ten swords now hung in the air, each made of coalesced water!
Tea Master Liu Su: The saying goes, "the essence of rain and dew grows cold, and fear grips the hearts of villains bold."
Tea Master Liu Su: In a flash, each scoundrel was struck down in turn by these swords, and there they lay, groaning and begging for their lives...
Traveler: Alright!
Tea Master Liu Su: ...But the young hero did not grow lax, for he heard a rustling in the bamboo forest, a sound most ominous.
Tea Master Liu Su: And indeed, another pair of eyes watched him from within...
Tea Master Liu Su: Now, who was this interloper...
Tea Master Liu Su: All shall be revealed in my next telling!
Traveler: (Stop listening)
Tea Master Liu Su: "What sorcery is this lad working?" But in truth, the young hero was no thaumaturge...

Tea Master Liu Su: Well then, dear guests, what would you all like to hear next?

## Talk

Traveler: (Listen in)
Tea Master Liu Su: And they say that—
Tea Master Liu Su: The present days are quick to pass, but their stories are easily told — and few remain who may still recall the histories of old. Thus, we must pass down stories, so that battles and sages, gods and adepti are always remembered.
Tea Master Liu Su: Now, lean close in your seats and lend me your ears, for I shall speak now of Rex Lapis.
Tea Master Liu Su: This tale begins two thousand years prior. The days then were not ones of peace, as you and I remember...
Tea Master Liu Su: Liyue then was a place of contention between countless gods. Foul demons roamed the land, and the people could find no words to describe their agony...
Tea Master Liu Su: Then, Rex Lapis arose as the head of the adepti, and saved the people from calamity...
Traveler: (Keep listening)
Tea Master Liu Su: Indeed, Rex Lapis was the Prime of Adepti, and by his side stood the Seven Guardian Yakshas, mighty even amongst their kin.
Tea Master Liu Su: It was then that Rex Lapis fought a great battle against the sea monster, the tyrant of the oceans.
Tea Master Liu Su: That sea monster was a true titan, with a head as broad as Mt. Tianheng... Just think about it! How huge must its whole body have been, then?
Tea Master Liu Su: With its maw wide open, the sea monster lunged towards Liyue Harbor, intent on swallowing it and all its people whole!
Traveler: Yikes!
Tea Master Liu Su: ...But you must recall, dear guests, that Rex Lapis was a god, and he was not afraid!
Tea Master Liu Su: And he commanded the adepti in a loud voice, and gathered rock unto him within one hand — then, he summoned forth a rain of stones as large as buildings, beating that sea monster bloody!
Tea Master Liu Su: Those rocks then plummeted into the seas, and pinned themselves to the very ocean floor like so many long spears. Today, we know this place as the Guyun Stone Forest.
Tea Master Liu Su: And upon seeing this, the adepti and the yakshas fell upon the creature also, and with weapons and adeptus arts they frustrated the monster, filling its hide with wounds...
Tea Master Liu Su: Ah, but now, wickedness stirred in the creature's black heart. "O, this wretched Lord of Geo! I shall ruin his city, and then we shall see if he is more my foe, or their protector!"
Traveler: Oh no...
Tea Master Liu Su: So thinking, the sea monster churned the oceans, and sent forth a great wave hurtling towards the harbor.
Tea Master Liu Su: Even the adepti were dismayed, and ceased their assault for but an instant. But they looked to Rex Lapis, and lo! He was calm and unmoved.
Tea Master Liu Su: Why was Rex Lapis undaunted, you ask?
Tea Master Liu Su: Listen closely, for all will be revealed in the next telling...
Traveler: (Stop listening)
Tea Master Liu Su: ...But you must recall, dear guests, that Rex Lapis was a god, and he was not afraid!

Traveler: (Stop listening)
Tea Master Liu Su: By your leave, dear guests, I shall spin another tale...

## Talk

Tea Master Liu Su: ...an epic fight. Legendary. The skies went black, there were howling winds and waves as high as houses. So the vile demon struck again, this time with all his might... but the adeptus just managed to dodge it! It was a powerful hit indeed; landed square on Mt. Tianheng! Boom!
Tea Master Liu Su: How powerful was the hit? Try powerful enough to tear open the base of the mountain!
Tea Master Liu Su: "A slight crack in the foundation; what's the big deal," you say? Well, let me tell you. Suddenly, there was a thunderous sound of giant rocks rolling down the mountains: The whole of Mt. Tianheng was on the verge of collapse! Meanwhile, down in the village, everyone stared up at the sight of impending doom and trembled with fear.
Tea Master Liu Su: Skybracer knew that if he didn't act quickly, the entire village was going to be reduced to a pulp! Oh, the humanity...
Traveler: Oh, the humanity!
Tea Master Liu Su: This was it. It was now or never... Suddenly, the adeptus had a brainwave. "Aha! My antlers..."
Tea Master Liu Su: Now. As we all know, the pair of antlers on Skybracer's head were a gift from the Lord of Geo. And what a magnificent gift they were: They were ten feet long and a hundred times harder than the hardest iron you can imagine...
Tea Master Liu Su: That's when he summoned a fellow adeptus.
Tea Master Liu Su: This masked companion was also a formidable fighter. He took a deep breath, and then with one almighty strike from his polearm he tore the antlers clean off the adeptus' head. Crash! They came tumbling to the ground...
Tea Master Liu Su: Skybracer picked the antlers up off the floor. His own antlers. A piece of his very own body. And he thrust them into the foot of Mt. Tianheng! Guess what happened next?
Tea Master Liu Su: It stopped the mountain from falling down — yes... but it also raised the mountain to thousands of feet higher than it had stood before!
Traveler: Yeah!
Tea Master Liu Su: ...My friends, do not think of this antler removal as anything remotely similar to a haircut. Antlers are made of bone, and grow straight out of the skull.
Tea Master Liu Su: What was that gushing sound? Blood, spraying out from Skybracer's head like a fountain, coating everything in sight!
Tea Master Liu Su: The adeptus grotesquely wiped his hand across his blood-soaked skull, and began racing back up the mountain to wipe the vile demon off the face of the earth. You can imagine how ferocious he looked now, all covered in blood with murder in his eyes! A great adeptus? More like a king of the demons!
Tea Master Liu Su: Still, to the people who lived below the mountain, Skybracer was their savior, a great and merciful adeptus who had saved them all from certain doom. In fact, they thought more highly of him than they thought of the Lord of Geo.
Tea Master Liu Su: The rain continued to pour down, and the gutters began to swell...
Tea Master Liu Su: But no one really knew how much of it was the rain, and how much was the grateful tears of a rescued people... nor did anyone know how much was the spilled blood of Skybracer...
Traveler: I—I'm sorry, I really have to go now...
Tea Master Liu Su: ...Friends, those antlers; I'm telling you...
