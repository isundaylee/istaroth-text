(Quest is part of chapter: Khvarena of Good and Evil)

# Awakening's Real Sound


## Talk 1

Sorush: That tree... Rashnu is there, but...
Sorush: *sigh* Let us draw nearer. I fear that returning Rashnu to the Vourukasha Oasis may not be so easy a thing.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Huh... It's you, Nasejuna! What are you doing here?
Nasejuna: #Ah, honored envoy of Khvarena, and you two... Ah, our Yasnapati and his companion, I suppose?
Paimon: #Gah. Just call us Traveler and Paimon!
Nasejuna: Since I have been given such permission, then allow me to call you by those names... Do you two remember what I mentioned earlier, about how we Skeptics have always been searching for the Kory Drums?
Paimon: Uh, it was about them being important items for some ritual or something, yeah.
Nasejuna: Well, while I can see that the proper terms were not remembered, that is the essence of the matter, yes.
Nasejuna: The two of you have been acknowledged by Khvarena's Envoy, and yet you know little of our glorious history. I fear that you may be led astray by heresies and heterodoxies from the forest.
Nasejuna: Allow me, then, to explain the true history of Barsom and the Kory Drums.
Traveler: I'll be honest, I'm not so concerned with this...
Paimon: Yeah, the stuff Nasejuna says is even harder to understand than the stuff Sorush talks about... Paimon didn't catch any of it the first time...
Sorush: Hmph. In that case, say it more often, Nasejuna, until even one such as Paimon can remember every last word.
Paimon: #Uhh... In that case, let's just hear it once, shall we? Traveler has a good memory. It'll be fine as long as he remembers.
Nasejuna: ...Long ago, our predecessors worked to quell the disaster that occurred in this land and formed a profound friendship with the Pari.
Nasejuna: Barsom's familiar had a preference for music, so we crafted Kory Drums for her. During the ceremony where our bonds with the Pari were made official, five drums had to be gathered and played according to scores.
Nasejuna: Though the Kory Drums are long lost, the drum scores have withstood the corrosion of the sandstorms. As you can see, they have been almost perfectly preserved.
Nasejuna: Words shall nary describe the true magnificence of that occasion. When the Kory Drums sounded, all things reverberated in unison. It felt as if their sound could freely traverse space and time...
Nasejuna: Those who witnessed it were all shaken to the core. Even the elements themselves were stirred.
Traveler: Sounds like a very lively time.
Nasejuna: *sigh* It's a shame that we Skeptics failed to pass on our legacy, resulting in the loss of all the Kory Drums. And however loudly we cried out, Barsom's familiar would never again utter a word in response.
Paimon: Barsom's familiar... Is this the Rashnu Sorush mentioned before? Is that who you're talking about? But why wouldn't she respond to the Order of Skeptics' call?
Sorush: The Pari and the Order of Skeptics both value tradition and ceremony, so there is routine to our actions.
Paimon: They talk about tradition, but then they lost their drums...
Sorush: This is hardly a peaceful land. That such things would happen is little surprise.
Paimon: Mm, okay... Seems like getting Rashnu back to the Vourukasha Oasis with us won't be easy...
Nasejuna: That is so. We will need to collect all the Kory Drums and play them according to the score...
Nasejuna: Thankfully, I have never once given up searching for the lost drums. I have been gathering the relevant clues even before your arrival.
Traveler: As one might have expected of you, Lord Nasuraia.
Nasejuna: There's no need to flatter me. After all, if Aryadeva had not...
Nasejuna: ...My apologies. I refer to an elder amongst the Order of Skeptics who left for Sumeru City to work on his... light novels, the dratted things. This heavy responsibility would not have fallen to me otherwise.
Paimon: He became a light novelist?
Nasejuna: He rambled on and on about how "warring against the Yae Publishing House editor and opponents in Genius Invokation TCG should still be considered war"... But if you ask me, he's just turning into a ridiculous old geezer.
Nasejuna: But he's still an elder who knows more about our heritage than I do, so I have to ask him for information regardless of any... disagreements we might have.
Nasejuna: He's reluctant to answer any questions that don't have to do with light novels and card games, though. It took me three whole questions to receive a single reply...
Nasejuna: Anyway, it took me a great deal of effort just to gather clues about the Kory Drums.
Traveler: I'm getting a headache just thinking about it.
Traveler: Story time, is it? Joy.
Nasejuna: This is no idle yarn to be told after tea. It is the tale of our meeting with the Pari, the scions of the divine bird, and the long years of war we have endured here in this land thereafter.
Paimon: Uh, Paimon would prefer "idle yarns," in that case...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Speaking of that, we did find Kory Drums other than the one Katheryne gave us! Not the whole set of five, but still...
Paimon: Yay, new clues! But Nasejuna, if you had the clues all along, why didn't you go look for the lost Kory Drums yourself?
Nasejuna: #That's an easy one to answer. Traveler, it seems like you're not in possession of a Vision.
Traveler: That's right, I am not.
Nasejuna: And yet, you're capable of bending the elements to your will... What an enviable gift. Unfortunately, I wasn't blessed with such a gift.
Nasejuna: So it is good that you are here... I mean, we could save quite a lot of trouble for Lady Sorush with your help. Otherwise...
Nasejuna: I would have to make other arrangements.
Nasejuna: Hahaha, but just as I said before, it seems that even fate is on my side...
Nasejuna: Lady Sorush, and you two, please, come with me. Hidden treasures may be found closer by than we think.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Yay, new clues! But Nasejuna, if you had the clues all along, why didn't you go look for the lost Kory Drums yourself?
Nasejuna: #That's an easy one to answer. Traveler, it seems like you're not in possession of a Vision.
Traveler: That's right, I'm not.
Nasejuna: And yet, you're capable of bending the elements to your will... What an enviable gift. Unfortunately, I wasn't blessed with such a gift.
Nasejuna: So it is good that you are here... I mean, we could save quite a lot of trouble for Lady Sorush with your help. Otherwise...
Nasejuna: I would have to make other arrangements.
Nasejuna: Hahaha, but just as I said before, it seems that even fate is on my side...
Nasejuna: Lady Sorush, and you two, please, come with me. Hidden treasures may be found closer by than we think.

## Talk 5

Paimon: That's strange. There's no path here at all! Seems like you're not all that good a guide, Nasejuna.
Sorush: There are signs of rockfall...
Nasejuna: You are observant indeed, honored envoy. I am inclined to think that monster activity caused the rocks to collapse and thus block this... Well, let us call it a path.
Nasejuna: But you may leave this to me, everyone. This problem only requires... a little spark to solve. Ah, yes. For safety concerns, please stand back a bit.
Black Screen Text: Nasejuna cleans the stone crevice before putting a small package inside. He fills the gap back up, retreats to a safe distance, and lights the fuse.
The large rock blocking the way splinters into smaller pieces, and when the dust finally clears, a Gray Gate appears in its wake.
Nasejuna: *cough* Well, that's it for those stones blocking the way.
Paimon: Wait, why's there still a gate in the way?
Traveler: There's always another gate to go through, huh?
Nasejuna: We used to be able to pass through. As for breaking the seal on this Gray Gate, we will need your help, you two.
Paimon: Well, guess that falls to us, huh?
Traveler: It does seem quite sturdy...

## Talk 6

Nasejuna: Regardless, now that we know where the Kory Drums are specifically, we just need to retrieve them all.
Nasejuna: Although the trial here has been destroyed, that may not be the case in other places.
Sorush: #Whether they are or not shall be little issue. Let us leave that task to my Yasnapati. This should be no issue to someone of his caliber, no?
Paimon: Of course! We're professionals, y'know.
Nasejuna: In that case, you can find the other Kory Drums so long as you follow these notes. I leave that to the two of you. Good luck.
Paimon: #Right, Traveler, remember to record the drum scores on the stone walls. We'll definitely need them at some point!

## Talk 7

Paimon: Speaking of which, if we take the Dendro Drum here into account, it seems like we've found all five Kory Drums, haven't we? It feels as if we just... happened upon them as we were adventuring.
Traveler: Convenient things like that do happen every once in a while, I suppose.
Nasejuna: As expected of the Yasnapati whom Lady Sorush acknowledged. This... went faster than I thought it would.
Nasejuna: Have you recorded the entire drum score carved into the stone walls? If you have, let us return to Barsom to begin the ritual.

## Talk 8

Paimon: This place is full of Gray Crystals...
Black Screen Text: Nasejuna looks around a bit before collecting some scattered records and browsing through them.
Nasejuna: It is not too far from what I expected. The mechanism that sealed the Dendro Drum was once here, but it has been destroyed. There are even some notes here that show where the other Kory Drums might be found.
Nasejuna: As the elders put it, when the Kory Drums were lost in a single night, the Order of Skeptics was overcome with great grief.
Nasejuna: Losing the drums meant losing the bridge that connected them to Barsom's familiar, and from then on, the young were never again able to listen to her teachings — this was a grave incident indeed.
Nasejuna: Great efforts were made by all to search for the drums thereafter, but few gains were made due to the obstruction posed by the defiled energies. According to the elders, this is one of those old locations.
Nasejuna: But as you have seen, those without the power to combat the brute might of the defilement, those who cannot wield the elements, and those who have not obtained the trust of Khvarena's Envoy are unable to reach this place.
Nasejuna: Aryadeva also attempted to retrieve the Dendro Drum here in his youth, but he did not succeed, and has been silent about the matter ever since.
Nasejuna: A sense of responsibility, perhaps... or was it pride that closed his mouth?
Paimon: Y'know, when you said that the Order of Skeptics had a terrible relationship with the Akademiya, Paimon thought that you'd all just stay here.
Paimon: Now that there's that big hole in the sky, never mind not coming back to help out... Don't you think it's kinda weird that he's just over in Sumeru City writing his novels and playing his cards?
Traveler: Perhaps he can achieve in fantasies what he could not in reality?
Paimon: You mean writing the story of his failures into a light novel but changing the ending? ... How's that supposed to solve a real-life problem?
Traveler: People need hope in their lives, even if it isn't real.
Paimon: Well, Paimon thinks that sticking together is our best chance of fixing this sky-hole problem. It concerns Sorush too, after all!
Sorush: Hehe. Your concern, Paimon, is rather wasted on one destined for so grand a sacrifice as I.
Sorush: Or perhaps I should say that evaluating the choices and fates of others is, itself, an overly prideful act.
Paimon: #Paimon just... just... Ugh, Traveler, help Paimon out here!
Traveler: We're just here to complete a commission.
Paimon: Eh? Shouldn't we be saying that "we can't just let you be"?
Nasejuna: Forgive my saying so, but such thoughts might be a bit unprofessional for adventurers and specialists.
Traveler: We're to respect their wishes and wish them well.
Paimon: Aren't we also supposed to ask them to "leave it to us"?
Sorush: I do thank you for your aid, of course, but do not forget. I am the main character of this hymn.

## Talk 9

Paimon: #Well if you say so, Sorush, then leave this to us! Just relax, Nasejuna. We know the Kory Drums are very important. Traveler's not going to ruin them or anything!

## Talk 10

Traveler: We'll meet there again later.
Rashnu: Good. Then I shan't have to think about what I should say on the way.

## Talk 11

Paimon: Time to look for the other Kory Drums!

## Talk 12

Paimon: Let's see... Next, we just need to put the Kory Drums back in their original places before performing the piece according to the scores on the stone walls, right?
Paimon: Rashnu will definitely be happy to answer us when she hears her favorite music.
Nasejuna: Do excuse my presumption, but the ritual that bound the Order of Skeptics to the Pari is one of great significance...
Nasejuna: I think that it would only be proper Order of Skeptics regulation if its Vijnanapati — that is to say myself — were to preside over it.
Paimon: Eh? But we were the ones who got all the five Kory Drums!
Nasejuna: Even if you are Lady Sorush's Yasnapati, I believe this to be out of line... or should I call this prideful presumption upon her favor?
Nasejuna: Lady Sorush is Khvarena's Envoy. She might have behaved more amicably to the two of you on account of your aid in fulfilling her destined mission...
Nasejuna: Yet this is but a manifestation of her virtue, and not any credit of yours. Do not forget your place. Give praise and stand in awe of her every action, as you should.
Paimon: Uh, that's what you say... But even though Sorush always acts all high and mighty, Paimon doesn't think she's all that great... or that distant from us.
Sorush: That does not sound like something that shall be written into a hymn of praise.
Traveler: Well, I'd say it's praise enough by Paimon's standards.
Sorush: #Well, what about you, then, Traveler? Do you desire... Do you want to play the Kory Drums and awaken the familiar of Barsom for me?
Traveler: Eh, Nasejuna can do it. Being a bystander's alright. Sometimes.
Nasejuna: Ah, a sensible person, I see. After all, such an important ritual should indeed be left in the hands of one who understands our traditions the most, and who occupies a most suitable position...
Sorush: Silence! I did tell you before that a Pari's word is final. Doubt not my judgment.
Nasejuna: ...As you will.
Sorush: #Traveler, I propose to give you, and no one else, this honorable task. Do you accept?
Traveler: You need not speak in such a winding manner, Sorush.
Paimon: #That's right! If you want to ask Traveler for help, just say "I'll leave it to you" or something. No need for all this weird talk!
Sorush: This is not "weird talk." These are words that befit a Pari's stature. Well then. I shall take that as your acquiesence.
Paimon: #Well if you say so, Sorush, then leave this to us! Just relax, Nasejuna. We know the Kory Drums are very important. Traveler's not going to ruin them or anything!
Traveler: I'm not a bad performer.
Paimon: Exactly. Cooking, combat, errands, espionage, we can do it all! This is definitely way easier than extinguishing the Sign of Apaosha — we're not gonna trip up here!
Nasejuna: And yet adventurers you remain, rough folk of the outdoors. It would be best if I handle such critical matters related to our history and tradition as this...
Sorush: #Nasuraia. He is the Yasnapati I have chosen, and now he willingly serves. Will you bar our path?
Nasejuna: I... I have no reason to doubt your decisions, astute as they are...
Sorush: #Then it is concluded. Speak no more. Come, Traveler. This momentous task is yours.
Traveler: Don't you worry.
Sorush: Oh, I have no fear. You are my Yasnapati, after all.

## Talk 13

Traveler: Let's go together.
Rashnu: Going together with humans? ... *yawn* Alright.
Black Screen Text: You return to the Vourukasha Oasis with Rashnu.

## Talk 14

Paimon: Let's see... Next, we just need to put the Kory Drums back in their original places before performing the piece according to the scores on the stone walls, right?
Paimon: Rashnu will definitely be happy to answer us when she hears her favorite music.
Nasejuna: Do excuse my presumption, but the ritual that bound the Order of Skeptics to the Pari is one of great significance...

Sorush: #Then it is concluded. Speak no more. Come, Traveler. This momentous task is yours.
Traveler: Don't you worry.
Sorush: Oh, I have no fear. You are my Yasnapati, after all.
Traveler: I've learned many forest tunes from the Aranara.
Paimon: Yup, and the Aranara sure do love music! And since Rashnu is someone who will respond to humans who call out to her using the music of the Kory Drums, she's definitely a music-loving Pari too, huh?
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon wonders if she'll enjoy Aranara music too...
Nasejuna: The musical scores of the Kory Drums cannot be compared to some forest ditties! They are part of Order of Skeptics tradition... Perhaps I should be the one to perform instead, rather than let outsiders do it...
Sorush: #Nasuraia, you too have merely understood this task from mere writings. The way I see it, would he, experienced in the performing arts as he is, not be the more reliable choice?
Traveler: The principles are the same. This should be no problem.
Nasejuna: But...
Sorush: #No buts. So I have decided, and so it shall be — Traveler shall do this deed.

## Talk 15

Rashnu (???): *snore* *snore*
Nasejuna: Ah! Barsom's familiar has answered our call!
Paimon: She must be Rashnu. Don't you think she seems kinda... tired, though? Looks like we might need to help her out somehow...
Sorush: This is Rashnu indeed, but...
Traveler: Perhaps we could have a nice meal?
Paimon: That's right! Grub! Meat, veggies, sweet, salty... Ooh, what should we get? Actually, hang on. Do Pari enjoy human food at all?
Traveler: Perhaps a repeat performance might do?
Rashnu: So... noisy... So... sleepy.
Paimon: Paimon kinda thought this might go differently. Y'know, like a moving reunion after many years... Not gonna happen?
Rashnu: You are Sorush. I recognize you.
Sorush: #That's right. This is my Yasnapati, Traveler, and his companion, Paimon. And that is the Nasuraia of the Order of Skeptics.
Rashnu: The Skeptics... Yasnapati... *yawn* I do not wish to know... about these human affairs.
Rashnu: Humans and their drums... are so noisy. I threw them into different places so I could... sleep in peace.
Traveler: ...Oh, the scent of lies!
Paimon: Well, that wasn't Paimon's fault!
Nasejuna: How...? But our documents recorded this so very clearly...
Nasejuna: Nor did Lady Sorush say anything against this...
Sorush: ...You must have slumbered too long here, Rashnu, muddling your memory of these affairs. Surely the scattering of the Korybantes was meant to select those who might clear the trials...
Sorush: With those who could not solve such a small problem proving unfit to call themselves Yasnapati. For how then would they aid me in my great work of extinguishing the Sign of Apaosha?
Rashnu: The Sign... *sigh* I'm so tired... but this is not the time to sleep.
Sorush: #Yes... You see, Traveler truly deserves the title of "Yasnapati." He has helped me immensely. But his help alone is not enough...
Sorush: Rashnu, I need yours as well.
Rashnu: Ah... I get it. It was Zurvan who...
Sorush: She, too, approves of me, of course! Alright, Rashnu, will you come with me to the Vourukasha Oasis?
Rashnu: *yawn* Well, it is not impossible.
Nasejuna: Barsom's familiar, please wait. I have many queries regarding the Skeptics' traditions...
Rashnu: Human business... Later, perhaps. We can talk later. Perhaps after I... sleep for a bit. Maybe then.
Nasejuna: Uh...
Sorush: Nasuraia, do you not have other things to attend to? We can save your business with Rashnu for another day.
Nasejuna: ...Yes. I will return to camp to accomplish... that which I should.
Paimon: Y'know, Paimon kinda feels bad for Nasejuna right now.
Traveler: I'm afraid this isn't something we can butt into.
Paimon: Yeah. Nasejuna and Sorush have known each other for a long time... They can settle this stuff between them, can't they?
Paimon: Whatever the case, if you'll come with us to the Vourukasha Oasis, Rashnu, Sorush will be one step closer to getting the Chaplet.
Rashnu: Together... now?
Traveler: Wait. So this was all a misunderstanding?
Paimon: Well that's one huge misunderstanding, wouldn't you say? Even Paimon doesn't do that.
