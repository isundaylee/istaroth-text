Traveler: And you are...?
Boyan: Ah, dear guest, how fortunate that our paths should cross! Boyan's the name, "a merchant from Liyue" is the game.
Boyan: I transport goods from Liyue to Fontaine, and goods from Fontaine to Sumeru, and I pocket the difference. After all, everyone loves seeing things they've never seen before!
Boyan: A merchant's gotta keep their eyes peeled and their ears open. And I hear that tea's been on the downswing recently, and that's worrying news.
