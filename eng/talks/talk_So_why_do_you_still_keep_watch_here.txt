Traveler: So why do you still keep watch here?
Vind: Maybe it's because every beacon longs for its time to shine.
Vind: Even if I knew for certain that there would never be a single storm again, once in a while my mind would be drawn to the stories they used to tell in my father's generation...
Vind: The way our ancestors would defiantly blow the horn in the middle of a raging storm, sending a warning signal to all in Mondstadt...
Vind: And when I came back out of my reverie... I would find that I had walked all the way here, without realizing.
