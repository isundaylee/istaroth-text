Traveler: Adventure Challenge

## Talk

Iris: You're good, but I'm still a little better.

## Talk

Iris: You're quite vigilant, and your tactics are impeccable.

## Talk

Iris: Excuse me? Did you want something?
Iris: It's so cold here...
Iris: Cold is the norm when you're up a mountain like this one.
Iris: You look like a Traveler. So, are you planning on scaling the mountain?
Traveler: Just to have a look.
Iris: Fair enough. I'm not going to try and stop you... I've met my fair share of travelers and whatever you say, there's no dissuading them.
Iris: All I will say, if you're serious about this, is to keep an eye on your *body temperature* at all times.
Iris: If your temperature drops too low, not only will it slow you down, but you can also injure yourself. And if you're unlucky enough to get attacked by a monster in that state... Well, that's the last situation you'd want to find yourself in.
Iris: So, if your temperature drops dangerously low, get yourself to a *source of heat* and warm back up while you plan your next move.
Iris: In short, and I know you've probably heard this plenty of times, but it's true: This is, by far, the most dangerous place in all of Mondstadt. When you're climbing a mountain, you must always plan your movements carefully.
Iris: I've seen more than a few adventurers lose their lives because they didn't think before they acted...
Iris: Alright, I won't lecture you any longer. Just be sure to prepare before you set out.

Traveler: Is this place very dangerous?
Iris: I would strongly caution against venturing into these parts on a whim.
Iris: Low temperatures, monsters, rugged terrain... Everything here is far more dangerous than one would imagine.
Iris: ...Here are some of my notes from adventuring in Dragonspine. Take them with you — I trust that they'll be of some use.

## Talk

Iris: Hmm? Is something the matter? Did you come here to see the sights, or did that boy Cyrus send you here on some commission?
Iris: ...Well, whatever your reasons for being here may be, stay on your guard at all times.

## Talk

Traveler: So, what can you tell me about Dragonspine...
Iris: Alfry from the Intelligence Department says that Dragonspine has some sort of connection with the evil dragon that fought Dvalin in the past, though none of that really interests me.
Iris: As far as I'm concerned, this is just a place worth adventuring in.
Iris: One thing to note is that this place is more dangerous than any other place in Mondstadt. In this extreme cold, your first priority must be maintaining your body temperature.
Iris: ...Bravery and foolhardiness are not to be equated lightly here. It is best to proceed with a plan, lest you lose your life in vain.

## Talk

Traveler: That... boy, Cyrus?
Iris: Yes, Cyrus is my younger brother.
Iris: We used to go on adventures together — you could say that we were quite the famous duo, too.
Iris: But he's been tied down by all sorts of trivial matters ever since taking up the role of branch master of the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild. We haven't traveled together in quite some time.
Iris: I did receive an offer to become a Guild branch master myself, but I refused. As far as I'm concerned, it's much easier to be a regular adventurer.

## Talk

Traveler: You're... his sister?
Iris: Yes. We actually look quite alike, don't you think?
Iris: As for why he looks like he's from Mondstadt while I look like I'm from Liyue... It's a long story. Something to do with our parents.
Iris: ...Ho, do you mean to ask why I look younger than he does?
Iris: There's no big secret behind it. It's just a matter of maintenance and attention.

## Talk

Traveler: See you, then.
Iris: Stay on your guard and don't get careless. Ad astra abyssosque!
