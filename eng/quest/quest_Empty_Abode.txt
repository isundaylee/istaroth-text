# Empty Abode


## Talk 1

Paimon: It's stuck.
Venti: It's stuck.
Paimon: Hey, check out that <color=#00E1FFFF>roof</color>. Is there a giant <color=#00E1FFFF>hole</color> in it?
Venti: Hmm... I suppose we could make use of that <color=#00E1FFFF>wind current</color>.
Paimon: Let's make a detour then. Heading up!
Venti: Let's make a detour then. Heading up!

## Talk 2

Venti: Oh, we can't advance any further. The ruins seem to be guarded by ancient <color=#00E1FFFF>seals</color>.
Paimon: Is this the work of Dvalin?
Venti: No. These ruins were once part of an ancient city. Dvalin just happens to be nesting in these ruins for now.
Venti: These ruins even predate the existence of The Four Winds.
Venti: Mondstadt is a city without a ruler. However, before it was...
Venti: It was ruled over by a tyrant.
Venti: Anyway... I'll sing you that story when we have a chance in the future.
Diluc: The markings on this seal... If my archaeological knowledge is not mistaken, this appears to be a <color=#00E1FFFF>light actuator</color>.
Diluc: If we retrieve and <color=#00E1FFFF>reintegrate</color> all the <color=#00E1FFFF>parts</color>, we should be able to <color=#00E1FFFF>get it working</color>.
Jean: We should be close to completing the ceremony for this actuator.
Jean: Let's put the <color=#00E1FFFF>last part</color> back and see.
