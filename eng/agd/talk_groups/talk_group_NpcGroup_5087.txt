Traveler: What rooms are there in here?
Sedene: If I were to tell you, you'd get curious, so it might be best if I simply don't.
Sedene: Monsieur Neuvillette's office is just over by the side — this much everyone knows.
Sedene: And, well... Lady Furina lives on the top floor. She's a real celebrity, so she really doesn't have any time slots free.
Sedene: But not to worry, the Maison Gardiennage and the Marechaussee Phantom are also upstairs, so anyone with ill intent will not be getting very far regardless.

Sedene: There is a special entrance that leads to her suite which isn't accessible from here. If you really wanted to get there, you can try jumping off the roof.
Sedene: Someone did once try to do this. Fortunately, his life didn't wind up in any danger — he is presently hard at work at the Fortress of Meropide.

Traveler: Tell me about Lady Furina...
Sedene: Are you asking where Lady Furina lives?
Sedene: She used to have an apartment on the top floor. I remember someone did once try to get in there by jumping off the roof.
Sedene: Fortunately, his life didn't wind up in any danger — he is presently hard at work at the Fortress of Meropide.
Sedene: Anyway, that kind of thing won't happen again. Lady Furina left her official post to pursue a life closer to her own desires.
Sedene: She seemed a lot more relaxed last time I saw her, so I don't think you need to worry about her.
