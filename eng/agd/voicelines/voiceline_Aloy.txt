# Aloy Voicelines

## Hello
Aloy here. I don't know this world, but my arrows are sharp and my bow's ready. If your party needs help, I'll do what I can.

## Chat: Moving Out
Come on. Enough standing around, let's keep moving.

## Chat: Help
Let's get going. There are people who need our help.

## When It Rains
Rain. One way to wash off the grime.

## After the Rain
Sky's running out of rain for now. Time to dry off.

## When It Snows
The world always seems quieter when it snows.

## When It's Windy
Wind's kicking up again. Feels good to breathe it in.

## When the Wind Is Blowing
Wind is really whipping now. My face feels raw.

## Good Morning
Morning. World's starting to stir again. Me too, I guess.

## Good Afternoon
Day's half over, but we still have a lot to do.

## Good Evening
Sunset. We'll be under the stars soon.

## Good Night
Night's here. Time to rest, unless we're going on by starlight.

## About Aloy
I grew up an outcast, and it wasn't much fun. Even though I'm a stranger here, people are friendlier than the tribe that was supposed to raise me. It's... nice.

## About Us: Action
Everything I do is in the service of life, not death. That's why I'm here with you.

## About Us: Oath
An oath seems like a formality. But if you want mine, you've got it.

## About Us: Moving Forward
I'll do whatever it takes to finish this with you. I won't hesitate. I won't falter.

## Something to Share
If I have to share something, it'll be my bow... in the service of people who need the help.

## Interesting Things
This land has a past full of secrets, just like my world. I'll uncover all of it, if I have enough time.

## More About Aloy: I
I'm not much for talking about myself. The mission is what's important.

## More About Aloy: II
I never had parents. But a man named Rost raised me. He was stern, but kind and generous. And he trained me well. I miss him.

## More About Aloy: III
I spent my whole life looking for my mother and never found her, not really. But I found ancient messages from the woman I was... cloned from. It felt like she knew me. And how to inspire me.

## More About Aloy: IV
When I grew up, I didn't have any friends. Later in my travels, I made some. But I left that world before we could grow close. That's why I'm glad to have spent time with you.

## More About Aloy: V
Trust doesn't come easy for me, but I know I can trust you. You're a true friend, and I don't say that often.

## Aloy's Hobbies
Not sure if I have a hobby, unless you count reading things from the past. So, history... I guess?

## Aloy's Troubles
One world needed saving. Now another. There's never time to rest.

## Favorite Food
I'm not picky. Anything's better than traveling on an empty stomach.

## Least Favorite Food
Had an Oseram stew once that was so thick you could pave a road with it. Ugh.

## Birthday
Never put much stock in birthdays. Where I come from, it's a time to celebrate your mother, not yourself. Even so, I wish you a, uh... happy day.

## Feelings About Ascension: Intro
All right. Feels like we're making progress, but we can't stop now.

## Feelings About Ascension: Building Up
Getting better. Getting stronger. Always a good thing.

## Feelings About Ascension: Climax
No matter how good a hunter you are, you can always get better. Never rest. Never stop learning.

## Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion
When we started out, you were just another stranger in a world I didn't understand. But after everything we've been through, I can say this for certain: My bow is yours, now and always.
