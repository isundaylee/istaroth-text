## Talk

Lisa: #Oh, when did you arrive, Traveler?
Lisa: I was completely lost in thought.

## Talk

Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Lisa: Aw, you're concerned for my well-being. Well, aren't you just the sweetest?
Lisa: You really know how to make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
Lisa: Don't you worry, I love it here.
Traveler: Is there any part you would want to renovate?
Lisa: Not at all.
Lisa: I think what makes this place so special is the fact that it was built personally by you.
Lisa: If I were to start nitpicking, it would only ruin your creativity and the unique charm you bring to the place.
Lisa: I certainly wouldn't want that to happen.
Traveler: Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the place?

## Talk

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Lisa: When would I ever not?
Lisa: If it weren't for my library work and potion-making duties, I'd love nothing more than to spend every day chatting with you like this.
Traveler: Have there been many people borrowing books recently?
Lisa: The number of people borrowing books is around the same as always. But lately, more people seem to be returning them on time than ever before.
Lisa: It seems that the citizens of the "City of Freedom" have become more conscious of time. Frankly, I'm quite relieved.
Lisa: Of course, I can't expect everyone to be as sensible as you, cutie.
Lisa: Haha...
Lisa: #You look so adorable with a little more red in your cheeks, Traveler.
Traveler: Made any special potions recently?
Lisa: Special potions? Hmm...
Lisa: Oh! As a matter of fact, I concocted one that makes textiles softer to the touch.
Lisa: And another that keeps the air fragrant and fresh. I'm quite fond of that one.
Lisa: They weren't requested by the Knights of Favonius, though. I just made them out of personal interest.
Lisa: Hmm... Is it just me, or have my interests become more domestic in nature since I met you...?
Traveler: Lisa, you're making me blush again...

## Talk

Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Lisa: I'd quite like to invite you to afternoon tea.
Lisa: I can offer you Sunsettia or Rose Bud Tea... And as for snacks, what kind of cake do you like?
Traveler: Are you going to bake it yourself?
Lisa: Haha, you guessed correctly.
Lisa: There is nothing I can't create if I put my mind to it.
Lisa: It's just that...
Lisa: Most of the time, I don't find these sort of things to be worth all the extra effort.
Lisa: But you are special to me. I don't think about energy spent if it's for you.
Lisa: Hmm, perhaps instead of asking for your preferences...
Lisa: ...I should let it be a surprise instead.
Traveler: Your kind offer alone was the most delightful surprise I could hope for.
Lisa: Oh my! Remind me not to add too much sugar, because you, cutie, are sweet enough already.
Lisa: Seriously, though, I need to start getting prepared...
Lisa: We can't have you underestimating me.
Traveler: I'm fine with anything.
Lisa: Ah, you're so easygoing. It's so relaxing spending time with you.
Lisa: But for once, I do want to take the trouble to make something nice.

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Lisa.
Lisa: Morning, cutie.
Lisa: I'm sure you're keeping on top of everything that needs doing.
Lisa: But if you find yourself struggling at any point, you know I'm always available to lend a hand.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Lisa.
Lisa: Have a good night, cutie.
Lisa: *yawn* I'm so sleepy. I'm a little envious of the way you manage to stay so energetic even at this hour.
Lisa: Be sure to get enough sleep...

Lisa: You have good taste in literature.
Lisa: Large bookshelves and a fireplace... This would be a most comfy place to put my feet up.
Lisa: I must reward you well for making this place so cozy.

## Talk

Lisa: Oh? A place suited for quiet research, I see.
Lisa: Not only are reference materials readily available, but you can initiate experiments at any time as well. This is truly a mage's ideal workshop.
Lisa: You really are a cutie after my own heart.

## Talk

Lisa: This is... a 【simple】 dialog that was triggered 【without the editor】!
Traveler: Oh, I see.
Traveler: It all makes sense now!
Lisa: ...I feel like you're just pretending to understand.
