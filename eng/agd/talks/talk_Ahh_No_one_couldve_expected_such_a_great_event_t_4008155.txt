Souka: Ahh! No one could've expected such a great event to have such a jaw-dropping conspiracy behind it!
Traveler: Everything is fine now!
Paimon: Yeah, the conspiracy has been dealt with! There's no need to be afraid!
Paimon: Wait, shouldn't Souka be shouting something like "Oh! I know what to add to my novel now!" at a time like this?
Paimon: Paimon is sure you found a ton of inspiration in such a drastic turn of events!
Souka: To be honest... things kinda got out of hand and completely exceeded my expectations! More details and background must be added right from the beginning for a villain like Elchingen.
Souka: It seems like you and Lady Yae noticed something was off a long time ago. Someone ordinary like me didn't have the slightest clue about what was going on.
Souka: If I'm going to add this to the novel, I'm gonna have to think real hard about how to build up the underlying mystery and slowly feed the reader different clues! It would be a little strange if the twist came too abruptly.
Souka: However, the arc where the villain is defeated by the protagonist has to be perfect! I'll try drinking two pots of wine when I get writer's block!
Souka: It's a method Lady Yae recommended. I'm gonna try it tonight!
Paimon: Wow! Just make sure you don't drink too much... You might scare yourself with the things you end up writing!
Traveler: I'll leave you to your thoughts...
Souka: Huh!? Are you guys leaving already? I'll be sure to thank you properly when I get the chance!
