# Food From Afar


## Talk 1

Paimon: Are we here? Ooh, it's one of those streetside places! Looks cute and cozy!
Kiminami Anna: Welcome!
Kamisato Ayaka: Miss Kiminami, how do you do?
Kiminami Anna: Aha, Miss Kamisato! Perfect timing. Your booking was for... Well, right now!
Kamisato Ayaka: I believe so.
Kamisato Ayaka: We'll be sticking to the order I placed in advance. As for the other matter we discussed... Thank you for your help.
Kiminami Anna: Excellent, no problem. And everything you asked for is ready and waiting.
Kiminami Anna: Traveler, tiny customer, please wait here for a moment while I prepare your food.
Kamisato Ayaka: Go ahead and take a seat. There's something I need to take care of, but I'll be back momentarily.
Traveler: Is something the matter?
Kamisato Ayaka: Ahem... It's nothing of that sort.
Kamisato Ayaka: I just have a few minor things I need to attend to. I won't be long.
Paimon: She sure left in a hurry... Whatever it is, it must be pretty urgent.
Kiminami Anna: So, you two are Miss Kamisato's friends?
Kiminami Anna: Haha, well, we serve all the classics. Sure, there are fancier-looking places out there, but the food here speaks for itself! Hope you enjoy it.
Kiminami Anna: Over the years we've been in business, we've gotten to know the Kamisato Clan quite well.
Kiminami Anna: Miss Kamisato and her brother are both fond of our food. They're always sending staff down here to order something and take it back to them.
Kiminami Anna: Her table booking surprised me — not least because it was a group reservation! This is the first time I've ever heard of Miss Kamisato going out for dinner with friends!
Paimon: The first time ever!? Whoa... Guess that makes us pretty important people, huh!
Kiminami Anna: Sure does, and I'm probably crossing the line here, but... I'm just telling you what others have told me. Apparently, Miss Kamisato doesn't have a lot of friends.
Traveler: ...That really surprises me.
Paimon: How is that possible? She's so kind and polite to everyone, Paimon would've thought that would make her really popular.
Kiminami Anna: That's what I used to think, too. But it turns out the rules of social interaction are a bit more complicated than that.
Kiminami Anna: Nobody in the neighborhood has a bad word to say about her. They all say she's beautiful, elegant, graceful, not to mention that she belongs to one of the most illustrious clans in the land. In short, they see her as a model young lady.
Kiminami Anna: But that's just it — people look at her and see a model of perfection, and they don't feel like that's something they can relate to. So the majority of kids from ordinary families don't dare even try to talk to her.
Kiminami Anna: So you see? On paper, she sounds like a girl everyone would want to get to know, but in practice, she finds it difficult to make friends...
Paimon: Huh, Paimon never would have guessed...
Kiminami Anna: We don't speak all that much, but we do go quite a way back. I've always admired her for taking on so many responsibilities at such a young age.
Kiminami Anna: So it makes me really happy to see her here with friends today!
Kiminami Anna: Anyway — relax, enjoy your meal, and... please talk to her as much as possible. I know she'll appreciate it.
Kiminami Anna: Consider it a favor for the whole neighborhood... Look after her for us!
Kamisato Ayaka: Ah...!
Paimon: Huh? That sounded like Ayaka...!
Kamisato Ayaka: *sigh* I'm so sorry, Traveler...
Traveler: Was that an explosion?
Kamisato Ayaka: Could you join me over there for a minute? Um... I need your help with something.
Kamisato Ayaka: I'm sorry! I didn't want to drag you away all of a sudden... I, um... just had a cooking catastrophe...
Paimon: Ohh, so that loud noise we heard came from the cooking pot...
Kamisato Ayaka: As you can see, this house is right next to the restaurant. It's where the owner lives.
Kamisato Ayaka: Actually, this whole compound is the family's private property. I asked Miss Kiminami to prepare some ingredients and utensils for me so that I could cook a special dish here.
Traveler: Why would you be cooking?
Paimon: Right! If there's something you wanna eat, you could just order it from the menu!
Kamisato Ayaka: Actually... I wanted to cook something as a gift for Tsubaki.
Kamisato Ayaka: My mother mentioned in her notebook that Tsubaki enjoys food from all over the world.
Kamisato Ayaka: So I thought, if I'm going to meet Tsubaki, perhaps a dish from overseas would make a fitting gift...
Paimon: A dish from overseas? So anything from outside Inazuma counts, right?
Paimon: If so... then we've got lots of options, don't we?
Traveler: Actually... I'm a bit of a pro in the kitchen.
Kamisato Ayaka: That's what I was thinking! You must have picked up a lot of knowledge about different cultures on your travels, hopefully including regional cuisines...
Kamisato Ayaka: Can I leave you to finish this task, then? Just as a personal favor... I—Is that okay...? I'll be indebted to you!
Traveler: Sure thing.
Kamisato Ayaka: Great! But... what kind of overseas dish would make a suitable gift? It needs to survive a journey from the kitchen to the recipient's doorstep...
Paimon: Oh, Paimon knows! There's one dish out there that was practically created for this purpose!
Paimon: Pizza~!
Kamisato Ayaka: ..."Pizza"?
Paimon: It's an assortment of toppings and sauce spread over a bread base and cooked in the oven. And it's so good!
Kamisato Ayaka: ...That does sound pretty good.
Kamisato Ayaka: Is it possible to add some of Inazuma's local flavor to this?
Paimon: No problem! Pizza is almighty!
Traveler: My time to shine.
Traveler: You could say my food is out of this world.
Paimon: Hey! Don't make this weird!
Traveler: What's going on?
Traveler: Is it a fight? Do you need backup?

## Talk 2

Paimon: Oh, it's ready!
Traveler: Here it is.
Kamisato Ayaka: *sniff* It smells delicious... You're an excellent cook, Traveler.
Kamisato Ayaka: *sigh* I would love to be able to master dishes from all over the world...
Paimon: Well, all you need to learn is a recipe. We can bring you some more recipes in the future, if you like.
Kamisato Ayaka: Great! I look forward to learning from your culinary expertise.
Kiminami Anna: How are you all doing?
Kiminami Anna: Whoa, is this...? Miss Kamisato, this must be the dish you were talking about?
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes, an overseas dish cooked by the Traveler.
Kamisato Ayaka: Could I trouble you to package it for me?
Kiminami Anna: Sure, no problem!
Kiminami Anna: Ooh, it smells good! I bet it tastes amazing. Aw, now I really want to put something like this on our menu...
Paimon: Hehe, want us to teach you how to make it?
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh! Could you?
Traveler: Sure could.
Paimon: The most satisfying meals are the ones you share with other people. So Paimon thinks that our friends in Mondstadt wouldn't mind us sharing this dish with Inazuma.
Kiminami Anna: Really? Aw, that's great, I've always wanted to learn how to cook some international dishes!
Kiminami Anna: If you can write down a recipe for me, I'll add it to our menu and put a promotion where everyone will see it!
Kiminami Anna: Since we became a closed nation, people haven't had the chance to try anything new. Traveler, you're the best!
Kiminami Anna: I'll go pack up this dish for Miss Kamisato. Please make your way back to the restaurant whenever you're ready, the food will be waiting for you.
Kamisato Ayaka: You could have sold that recipe for a high price, but you selflessly gave it away for free...
Kamisato Ayaka: ...You're a wonderful person.
Traveler: Aw shucks, Ayaka...
Kamisato Ayaka: I mean it... I admire you a lot, and I'm so proud to be friends with someone of such fine character.
Kamisato Ayaka: Well, you should probably write down the recipe now, no?
Paimon: #Yeah, Traveler, let's make sure we include all the details and then give it to Miss Kiminami!
Paimon: So, pizza! Start with the basic ingredients.
Traveler: Mushroom + Flour
Paimon: Correctamundo!
Paimon: Right, now to add the next couple of ingredients!
Traveler: Cabbage + Cheese
Paimon: Mmm, yep! That's right!
Paimon: Now to add the cooking instructions... "Place onto oven rack at high heat and cook till golden brown."
Paimon: Alright, it's done!
Paimon: Long may our reputations and our recipes precede us, wherever we go in Inazuma!
Kamisato Ayaka: I have no doubt that they will. This dish is exquisite.
Paimon: Cool, then let's get this recipe to Miss Kiminami, pronto!
Traveler: Naku Weed + Fluorescent Fungus
Paimon: Xiangling sure left a deep impression on you, huh...
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh? Who's Xiangling?
Paimon: A friend of ours who's a really talented chef, though she has some strange tastes... Still, she's one of Paimon's favorites!
Traveler: Sea Ganoderma + Lavender Melon
Paimon: Seriously? Okay, well, you're the chef...

## Talk 3

Kiminami Anna: Hey! Have you written out the recipe?

## Talk 4

Ogura Mio: The garment will be ready later. Why not look around the area in the meantime?

## Talk 5

Kiminami Anna: Hi Traveler — is everything okay?
Kiminami Anna: I don't see Ayaka looking so flustered very often... Whatever it is, it must be a tricky situation.

## Talk 6

Kiminami Anna: Hey! Have you written out the recipe?
Kamisato Ayaka: Here it is!
Kiminami Anna: Thank you!
Kiminami Anna: Wowee, this is so exciting! I want to make it right away.
Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler, Paimon, please accept my sincerest apologies for delaying your meal.
Paimon: Hehe, no problem! Food always tastes better when you've worked up an appetite.
Kamisato Ayaka: Alright, let's dig in before it gets cold.
Kamisato Ayaka: Well, what do you think? Is Inazuman cuisine to your liking?
Traveler: It was all very tasty.
Traveler: It was nice to try something new.
Paimon: It's amazing! Paimon loved this one... Oh! A—And especially that one over there...
Kamisato Ayaka: Haha, good. I'm relieved.
Kamisato Ayaka: Um... When I was attempting to cook earlier on, did you... chat with the owner at all?
Kamisato Ayaka: And did she, uh... say anything about me?
Paimon: She did, but don't worry, she's just happy for you is all.
Kamisato Ayaka: She's... happy for me?
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh... then... she must have told you. D—Did she, um...
Kamisato Ayaka: *sigh* What does it matter... I know just as well as anybody else that I've got no friends...
Paimon: Hey, it's not you, most people just haven't had the chance to talk to you one-on-one before.
Kamisato Ayaka: Thank you for your comforting words, Paimon.
Kamisato Ayaka: It's all true, though. I just... don't have very many friends.
Traveler: Don't be silly!
Traveler: You've got a friend in me.
Kamisato Ayaka: Most of the time I'm either accompanied by family or staff. So everyone must have found it quite a surprise to see me taking you out for a meal...
Paimon: Exactly! You've got at least two friends right here!
Kamisato Ayaka: Aw...
Kamisato Ayaka: Thank you... that makes me so happy!
Kamisato Ayaka: Ahem, excuse me... I—I'm forgetting myself.
Paimon: Hey now, expressing your feelings is the right thing to do. Keeping them locked away inside isn't gonna do you any good, now is it?
Kamisato Ayaka: I agree! So...
Kamisato Ayaka: I just want to say how happy I feel... that you both see me as a true friend.
Paimon: Of course we do. That's always been our style — if someone's nice to us, we're nice to them, too!
Paimon: Friendship can go a long way! Take your mom for example — she wrote about Tsubaki in her notebook, and now it's made you want to find them, too.
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes! I think friendship is an extremely precious thing, and ours is one that I will always treasure.
Paimon: Um, while we're on the topic though — who is this Tsubaki person, anyway?
Traveler: I'm all ears.
Kamisato Ayaka: Well, I think I have an idea, but it's just speculative at this point.
Traveler: ...?
Kamisato Ayaka: I think that Tsubaki... might be a fox envoy!
Paimon: A fox envoy?
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes. That's what I think.
Kamisato Ayaka: Even I, my mother's own daughter, had never even heard of this friend before. It just seems so mysterious. So I think it must be someone with transcendent abilities who doesn't show themselves very often.
Kamisato Ayaka: And fox envoys are nothing new. Stories have been told about them in Inazuma since ancient times.
Kamisato Ayaka: You must have met Guuji Yae before? Well, she's a fox envoy!
Kamisato Ayaka: That got me thinking, maybe there are fox envoys out there in Inazuma that people just don't know about... and maybe Tsubaki is one of them.
Paimon: Whoa, so Inazuma also has supernatural beings?
Kamisato Ayaka: Uh, when you say "also"...
Paimon: Well, before Inazuma we spent some time in Liyue. They have lots of supernatural beings there, like the adepti.
Paimon: All kinds of them, too... Up in the sky, down below the ground, in the water...
Kamisato Ayaka: Really... I have come across such things being asserted in books, but to hear someone talk about it from firsthand experience is extremely surprising.
Kamisato Ayaka: So, Liyue lives up to its reputation... Its culture has a long history and gives rise to the most beautiful legends. Quite captivating.
Paimon: You should come visit Liyue with us some time. The best part is... they have loads and loads of delicious delicacies!
Kamisato Ayaka: Really? I would love that!
Kamisato Ayaka: Speaking of delicacies — Traveler, Paimon, have you eaten your fill?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon has!
Kamisato Ayaka: Excellent, then let's collect the kimono. Then we can pay a visit to my mother's mysterious and transcendent friend...

## Talk 7

Kamisato Ayaka: Is the pizza ready?

## Talk 8

Ogura Mio: Your garment is ready, Miss Kamisato. I've folded and packaged it for you.
Ogura Mio: Oh, and the other item we discussed — that's ready too!
Kamisato Ayaka: Thank you very much.
Ogura Mio: No, thank you! It is a beautiful piece of clothing, and it was a pleasure to work on. See you again next time!
Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler, I have a gift for you.
Traveler: Hmm? Really?
Paimon: Whoa... Looks super fancy! Is that for wearing in your hair?
Kamisato Ayaka: It's a hairpin in the style of a white heron. As well as a hair accessory, you can also use it as an ornament.
Kamisato Ayaka: I couldn't ask for your help and offer nothing at all in return, so this is my gift to you.
Traveler: It's a beautiful gift, thank you very much.
Kamisato Ayaka: I'm glad you like it!
Paimon: Speaking of white herons, that's what your title means, doesn't it? Shirasagi Himegimi. So this gift is like a little piece of yourself. It's just as elegant and beautiful as you are.
Kamisato Ayaka: Hehe, you flatter me, Paimon. If this gift reminds you of me, that is all I could ask for.
Paimon: Hee-hee, it definitely will.
Paimon: Alright, well, now we've got what we came for, we can set off.
Paimon: Time to go meet Tsubaki!
Traveler: I will take very good care of it.
