# Vimana Agama: Dev Delver Chapter


## Talk 1

Jazari: The gates to scholarship will open to whoever has a seeking heart.
Jazari: Now go for it with that in mind!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hey, Ararycan, what are you doing here?
Ararycan: Ararycan has been waiting for you here since Ararycan finished sowing the flowers.
Ararycan: But then, something just fell off the Great Iron Mountain. It almost hit Ararycan!
Paimon: Oh no! We're sorry, Ararycan!
Ararycan: Paimon doesn't have to say sorry. Ararycan is fine. Ararycan is a fast runner, so Ararycan didn't get hit.
Traveler: Just glad it didn't hurt you.
Paimon: The robot's severed arm must have broken the entrance to the underground ruins open. Well, at least it wasn't completely useless.
Paimon: Then let's go down and have a look. Who knows what nasty things wait for us down there!
Ararycan: Ararycan is going with you!

## Talk 3

Paimon: The glowing thing in there must be the Ruin Golem's Chaos Core. Y'know, the one Jazari talked about.
Paimon: It's sealed by branches and vines, but something seems to be flowing out of it.
Ararycan: Ohh, it's the filthy stuff. Ararycan can feel it. This is what made the forest sick.
Paimon: Ah, some Abyss Mages seem to be up to something around those big branches. This can't be good...
Paimon: Paimon remembers Jazari said that the core's seal had been damaged. Maybe these Abyss Mages had something to do with it...
Paimon: Anyway, you should go and find a place to hide, Ararycan. Let's stop them!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Phew, it's finally over!
Paimon: Well, it was a long journey, wasn't it?
Traveler: Let's tell this story to Jazari...
Paimon: Oh right, if he knows about the core, he can help us apply for some funding and all that stuff.
Paimon: #But Paimon's not gonna enroll in the Akademiya or anything. You aren't planning to either, right, Traveler?
Paimon: Anyway, we don't know what Marana's Avatar has to do with the Abyss Order yet, but it's a good thing that we cured the forest's illness all the same.
Ararycan: *sob* Thank you for helping Ararycan.
Traveler: You're welcome, Ararycan.
Paimon: So, what do you plan to do next, Ararycan?
Ararycan: Ararycan will celebrate Festival Utsava. But Ararycan worries about the forest's illness.
Ararycan: There's a chance that the bad things that made the forest sick will come back. Ararycan needs to guard the forest.
Ararycan: So Ararycan will come back here after Festival Utsava.
Traveler: Wow, Aranara really do have tough jobs.
Paimon: If you ever need any help, Ararycan, be sure to come to us!
Ararycan: Okay, Ararycan will.
Paimon: Hehe! Take care of yourself. We'll see each other soon!
Traveler: Let's tell this story to grandpa Royinjan...
Paimon: Oh yeah, and grandpa Royinjan will say, "What an interesting story!"
Paimon: Who'd know that we actually saved the forest?
