Kayabuki Ikkei: Hey, how can I help?
Traveler: About the Hyakunin Ikki...
Kayabuki Ikkei: Hyakunin Ikki was originally a mysterious rite used by the Tengu-kin as a means of making a ruckus.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Later, after the Tengu-kin were deemed outlaws, Hyakunin Ikki was still held secretly from time to time... No one knows the identities of the tournament organizers, but that's not really important, is it?
Kayabuki Ikkei: The current Hyakunin Ikki is a rather rowdy brawl, all things considered. Anyone can participate in this blood-boiling festival, be they warriors or monsters.
Kayabuki Ikkei: That's got to be a dream come true for those who long for battle, eh?
Traveler: About the Tengu-kin...
Kayabuki Ikkei: The Tengu-kin were a group that used to be active in Inazuma. They revered the way of life of the tengu warriors, seeing fearless fighting as a path to self-actualization.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Whether they were feeling down, had something to celebrate, or even if they were simply bored, they would always use it as an opportunity to start a good old-fashioned fight.
Kayabuki Ikkei: ...Later as a result, the Tengu-kin were deemed outlaws by the Tenryou Commission for disrupting public order and disturbing the peace.
Traveler: ...Were the Tengu-kin really outlawed?
Kayabuki Ikkei: Huh? Hmm. I actually don't know. I've never really thought about it...
Kayabuki Ikkei: But... The crackdown must have occurred a long time ago. It has been ages since I last heard anything about them.
Traveler: ...You're not the one holding the event, are you?
Kayabuki Ikkei: No way, definitely not! How would that even be possible?
Kayabuki Ikkei: Ahem... As much as I look forward to seeing everyone in action, I alone don't have the funds to reward the victor...
Traveler: About your novel...
Kayabuki Ikkei: Ah, well... I'm sorry to say that "When the Wind of Death Blew Towards the Blond Samurai" didn't sell too well at the Irodori Festival previously.
Kayabuki Ikkei: But it's fine! That was just the prologue of the "Outlander Brigade" series. My next work, "The Fatal Flowery Blade," is sure to be a hit!
Kayabuki Ikkei: That said, I still haven't figured out exactly what I want to write yet... Nonetheless, I believe that watching you fight will be just the inspiration I need to write a brilliant novel!
Traveler: You're not taking part?
Kayabuki Ikkei: Me? I don't have any fighting chops. I only wish to record the dazzling performances of the fighters.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Since seeing your swordplay in particular, I've come to think that using my words to immortalize the dance of steel, as timeless as the sun above, is more my calling than participating in the competition myself.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Being able to recreate such glorious splendor using words on a page could also be considered a crowning achievement of martial artistry, right?
Traveler: Nothing.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Well, I hope I'll get to see that flashy swordplay of yours this time, too!
