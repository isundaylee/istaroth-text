Traveler: About Stormterror...
Six-Fingered José: The days when the dragon was circling the city in the skies... Those were dark days for the people of this city...
Six-Fingered José: But just when the knights thought that all hope was lost, a miracle! A mystery traveler showed up out of nowhere and saved the day!
Six-Fingered José: I have decided to base my latest song on the true story of the mystery traveler of Mondstadt!
Six-Fingered José: Sure, so I added a little extra detail here and there... But that, my friend, is the work of the artist!
Six-Fingered José: With an exciting new story like this to tell, I'm sure to win my audience back!
