Traveler: So, what's up ahead?
Fodil: It depends what you mean by "up ahead."
Fodil: On one side, you have Aaru Village. As you can see, it is a village bordering the desert, and is home to us, the people of the desert.
Fodil: Though we are cut off by the Wall of Samiel, this is still a safe place that welcomes those who wish for rest.
Fodil: Travel can be exhausting, and the desert is perilous. If you wish to stop for rest during your journey, this is the place to be.
