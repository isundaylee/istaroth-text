Traveler: And you are?
Nizami: I'm a bodyguard. Have you seen my employer? He's pretty obvious, since there's nothing else green around here.
Nizami: Is there anything to worry about here? I've got nothing to do. I take part in Pankration matches when I can, to keep active. But it's just not enough to scratch my itch, nowhere near enough!

Traveler: About the Fortress of Meropide...
Nizami: It's annoying that fights are banned outside of the arena. And there are hardly any monsters nearby... I need a place to cut loose and put my fists and feet to good use.

Traveler: How have you been lately?
Nizami: Quite well! Apart from the fact I have nothing to do... I go and spar with Roussimoff now and then, to stay active. But it's not enough!
Nizami: But you, fighting with you is exciting. Especially when I lose.
Nizami: Losing shows me where my weaknesses are, and that means I know how to keep getting stronger. Losing is to win, too. Makes sense, no?

Nizami: As for the strongest fighter in the Fortress of Meropide, I've got a candidate in mind. But he seems very busy and I rarely see him.
Nizami: And I'm not yet qualified to spar with him. I wonder if I'll get a chance before I leave Fontaine?
