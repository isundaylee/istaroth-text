# Rite of Descension


## Talk 1

Paimon: If you wanna find the Geo Archon, this is the only chance you'll get all year.
Paimon: Guess it's a good thing Venti brought it up earlier, otherwise we definitely would've missed this year's Rite of Descension.
Traveler: Do you know when it is?
Paimon: Uhh... might be today, might also be tomorrow...
Paimon: Look, we're already in Liyue so let's go ask some of the locals.
Paimon: Oh, right. About the Geo Archon, "Morax..."
Paimon: Did you know? The Mora that we use is named after this god.
Paimon: But it's seen as impolite for people from outside Liyue to refer to the Geo Archon by that name.
Paimon: So we should refer to the Geo Archon by the name Rex Lapis, like the people of Liyue do.
Traveler: Do you know where it is?
Paimon: Well, Venti brought up the time, but Paimon... knows nothing about where it is... Ehe.

## Talk 2

Guanhai: Oh! Are you also visitors here for the Rite of Descension?
Guanhai: To think I've lived in Liyue all these years and never come to see this before.
Guanhai: I guess it's like they say. Locals never visit the tourist spots.
Guanhai: I wish you well on your travels! Liyue always welcomes you!

## Talk 3

Linlang: Rite of Descension... Oh yeah, that reminds me, isn't that today?
Linlang: Once a year, Rex Lapis bestows upon us his divine prediction, guiding us on how to run Liyue for the coming year.
Linlang: Last year it was the Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing that was given the honor of asking for the divine prediction.
Traveler: Liyue Qixing?
Paimon: Ooh! Paimon knows this one!
Paimon: Mondstadt is to freedom as Liyue is to contracts. Liyue has a strong focus on business and trade.
Paimon: The Liyue Qixing — the seven leaders of the seven enterprises of Liyue — hold true control over Liyue.
Linlang: That's what outlanders always say.
Linlang: But true control over Liyue will always be held by Rex Lapis.
Linlang: The Qixing is comprised of mere mortals. Rex Lapis is a god. Mondstadt's god is nowhere to be seen, whilst our god is forever with us.
Linlang: Stay in Liyue long enough and you'll see...
Linlang: Given that you just left your godless city, it's time you experienced what it's like to be in a city whose god has walked with it through all of history.
Traveler: Yuheng?

## Talk 4

Bolai: You too wish to bear witness to the Rite of Descension? Me too, we all do!
Bolai: As a businessman myself, how could I not take interest in Liyue's most important business trends?
Bolai: The seventeen predictions given last year made more than a few ripples throughout the industry.
Bolai: What's more, there has been a rumor going around that the Tianquan herself, Ningguang, has been acting secretly in the shadows...
Bolai: She wants the rocks created by Geo Vision holders to be exempt from taxation.
Paimon: Wow... that's some super professional legal stuff that is!
Bolai: Haha. To be on the pulse of the predictions and the market is what makes this harbor what it is.
Bolai: Among The Seven, Rex Lapis is the oldest deity.
Bolai: His keen sense of strategy is well trusted among his people.
Bolai: Understanding the predictions as soon as possible can make all the difference in making your fortune!

## Talk 5

Changshun: Oh, you also want a little adepti luck too?
Changshun: Haha, seems you know a lot! Making a wish during this time is sure to get you the blessings of both the Adepti and Rex Lapis himself.
Changshun: I've already made my wish, so you can take this.
Paimon: Great, thanks!
Traveler: #I wish I could find my sister soon...

## Talk 6

Ivanovich: Your first time in Liyue? Actually, it's my first time to see the Rite of Descension too.
Ivanovich: Ah, look! That's Ms. Ningguang of the Liyue Qixing!
Ivanovich: Only those who have control in Liyue can preside over the Rite of Descension.
Ivanovich: Oh yeah, not sure if you knew, but most of the adepti appear in the form of various beasts.
Ivanovich: I heard that when attending these kinds of formal occasions, Rex Lapis himself appears as a celestial cross between two of Liyue's ancient mythical creatures...
Ivanovich: ...Sorry, I shouldn't interrupt your wish. Please, take this.
Traveler: I wish I could get some leads from the Geo Archon...

## Talk 7

Paimon: Wha... What's going on!?
Paimon: Did she just say Rex Lapis is...
Paimon: The Geo Archon... is... DEAD!?
Paimon: Oh no, the Millelith! Looks like they're nabbing suspects who got too close.
Paimon: Paimon's freaking out. The killer is amongst us!
Paimon: Wait... we got close... are we suspects!?
Paimon: Wait, where are you going?
Traveler: (It was a god we faced off against when we first arrived in this world too...)
Traveler: (We can't fall into their hands...)

## Talk 8

Paimon: *panting* Phew... Paimon's exhausted...
Traveler: I'm even more beat.
Paimon: So insensitive! You have no idea just how tiring floating arou— Wait!
Paimon: Just who are you exactly?
Childe (???): Call me Childe.
Paimon: Childe? What, so we're supposed to dote on you?
Childe: Haha, no no, not at all. It's an alias of sorts.
Childe: In Mondstadt, I don't suppose you came across a "Signora" by any chance?
Paimon: Signora... Childe...
Paimon: You're Fatui! One of The Harbingers!
Childe: Oh, no. Don't worry, I'm not looking for a fight.
Childe: Signora gave you quite the bad impression huh? Tsk, that woman... Can't say I'm a fan either.
Childe: Right, let's forget all about her, shall we? I'm here to help you.
Traveler: Help?
Childe: Yes. Help.
Childe: I'm not a bad guy... Okay perhaps I'm kind of a bad guy, but I'm not here to give you any trouble.
Childe: Would it be too much to ask for you to keep the sword sheathed?
Childe: #Haha, I thank you for your knightly nobility, Traveler.
Childe: I heard of your deeds in Mondstadt, so I couldn't help but notice you during the proceedings back there.
Childe: And because I had my eye on you the whole time, I know it wasn't you. Someone else was clearly behind it.
Childe: But... regrettably, given I'm a Fatui envoy from Snezhnaya... there's no way I'd be trusted after something of this magnitude.
Childe: The ruling Qixing of Liyue has always been overly suspicious of us.
Paimon: Well can you honestly blame them?
Childe: Hahaha. Guess I shouldn't try to deny that.
Childe: Okay, sure. Maintaining a distance between strangers is probably a good idea. Either way, I'm already used to it at this stage.
Childe: But right now, if you want to clear yourselves of any suspicion — you need to get yourselves to Northland Bank.
Childe: Staying here isn't an option. As the old Liyue saying goes: "The walls have ears."
Traveler: I don't need help from the Fatui.
Childe: Come now, don't be like that.
Traveler: Go. Leave.
Childe: Sure, I may be one of the Harbingers, but hear me out.
Traveler: Just what muscles does magical floating use exactly?

## Talk 9

Paimon: Northland Bank...
Childe: Correct. This bank was opened here in Liyue by Snezhnaya.
Childe: Though everyone knows Liyue is the most enterprising in Teyvat, Snezhnaya is not short of change either.
Paimon: Yeah well, poorer nations don't seem the type to have diplomats that come around acting the way yours do towards the Knights of Favonius.
Childe: Eh-hehehehe...
Childe: Here, let me give you this.
Paimon: This is a...
Childe: I'm not sure, exactly. Sometimes, all money can buy is "things" and not a name for oneself.
Childe: All I know is that it's a sigil. A sigil to keep the "mighty and illuminated adepti" from bringing harm to you.
Paimon: Adepti?
Childe: If you head north from the harbor, then west from Guili Plains, you will eventually reach a stone forest known as Jueyun Karst.
Childe: The people of Liyue believe it to be the abode of the adepti.
Traveler: They really believe that?
Childe: Legend or not, they believe it. As such, offerings to the adepti are made at its borders. Nobody dares venture in.
Childe: But I have no need for believing — not when I know for a fact that the adepti truly exist.
Paimon: Hate to admit it but your Fatui intel seems alright. But, why would we go looking for adepti anyway?
Childe: Ha, oh my little friend. There are plenty of reasons mortals seek the blessings of adepti.
Childe: Money, health, love... But you... you will go for justice.
Paimon: Justice?
Childe: The Qixing will already have dispatched the Millelith. They'll be seeking out the assassin from amongst the onlookers.
Childe: But how could a mere mortal kill a god that can sweep aside entire armies? Rex Lapis never gave up his power as a god.
Childe: This level of crude response is beyond what is called for. How suspicious...
Traveler: You think they're trying to hide the true culprit?
Childe: Or... to hide something else. Hard to say.
Childe: Even now, the Northland Bank wouldn't be able to hold the Millelith off for long, but the adepti can clear you of any wrongdoing.
Childe: Liyue was founded by the Geo Archon and the adepti — of course, it was built by force.
Childe: Look for them. And be faster than the Qixing's messengers, so you may give your version of events first.
Childe: If there is anyone that can help you in Liyue now, it can only be the mighty and illuminated adepti.
Traveler: You think the Qixing did it and they're trying to pin it on someone else?
Childe: Your thinking is even more radical than my own, Honorary Knight.
Traveler: Isn't it just a legend?

Guanhai: So better to head to Yujing Terrace, to the high ground.

### Additional Talk 7

Linlang: Rex Lapis is like a father who takes care of everything for you.
