Traveler: At least tea and coffee taste good, right?
Huatli: Oh sure, that they do, and I love them too. Great way to jolt yourself awake.
Huatli: Ah... *yawn* Speaking of which, I'm getting sleepy again...
Huatli: Wait, no. I mean, I should go meditate again. Let's chat again when we get the chance, alright? See you!
