Traveler: Where's the manual?
Banu: I put it with "Banu's Wisdom." Wait, did you not see one? Oh no, I must've forgotten to bring it from home...
Banu: But it's okay. Just put "Banu's Wisdom" on the ground and it will automatically point to where the Future Stars are. All you need to do is to follow its guidance.
Banu: Remember, after it runs for a while, it will need to rest a bit before it can point you to the location of the Future Stars again.
