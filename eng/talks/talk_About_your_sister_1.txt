Traveler: About your sister...
Takahashi: Yeah, I have a very cute little sister. She is currently back home on Watatsumi Island.
Takahashi: My sister is still young, but she is very clever and understanding. As her big brother, I hope that she can remain innocent and pure even as she grows up healthy and strong.
Takahashi: I will do my best to keep the peace for her sake as well. The Shogun's Army will not set foot on our homeland â€” not if I have anything to say about that!
