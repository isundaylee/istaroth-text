# Paimon's Hint After Sitting

Paimon: Gonna rest for a while. What's your plan?
Traveler: I'm thinking of doing a quest.
Paimon: That's easy! Just click on the exclamation mark at the top-left corner of the screen and you can view all the quests you have taken on so far.
Paimon: Some quests are really hard, and there's no way you will be able to complete them until you reach the right level for that quest. If your level isn't high enough, you're too weak.
Paimon: Anything else?
Traveler: Perhaps I should look around a bit more...
Paimon: Some areas are way more dangerous than others.
Paimon: You should train in some of the easier areas first, so you don't get beaten to a pulp so soon.
Paimon: Alfry of the Adventurers' Guild knows Teyvat like the back of her hand.
Paimon: She lives in downtown Mondstadt not far from the gate. You should go ask her about the areas that suit you.
Traveler: I think I need to become stronger.
Paimon: Well, you can't get stronger without handy weapons or rare Artifacts.
Paimon: Heard there's a lot of 'em in dungeons, but they're dangerous places. You'll probably get hurt.
Paimon: But... if you're too chicken to earn them, you could always purchase them here in Mondstadt.
Paimon: Weapons and Artifacts can also be enhanced and ascended.
Paimon: But you'll have to figure out the rest by yourself.
Paimon: Oh yeah, suppose your own level is pretty important too...
Traveler: I'm not sure yet... I need to think on it a bit more.
Paimon: Okay.
