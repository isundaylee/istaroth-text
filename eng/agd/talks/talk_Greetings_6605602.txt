Traveler: Greetings.
Manua: Hello, hello. I am Manua, the assistant to our chief. Hopefully she hasn't caused you any trouble...
Manua: Don't get me wrong, Amina is very reliable, and she's learned much in the ways of managing the tribe from her grandfather. I have only the fullest of faith in her potential.
Manua: But she is still young, and children are bound to miss some details from time to time, so please bear with her.
