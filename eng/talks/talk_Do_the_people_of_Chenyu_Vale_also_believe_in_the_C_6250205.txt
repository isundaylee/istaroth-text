Traveler: Do the people of Chenyu Vale also believe in the Crane Adepti?
Pingshan: Good question! I once had the same doubts, which I asked my master about.
Pingshan: He just said that all adepti who can protect the people are good adepti, whether they be Carp, Crane, or Deer.
Pingshan: So I stopped thinking about it. After all, they're just legends. No one knows if they're real or fabricated.
Pingshan: But if sincerity brings good luck, then that's all that matters!
