Traveler: About Stormterror...
Viktor: Hehe, now that's a topic that piques my interest. I am quite curious to see how the Knights of Favonius will handle Stormterror.
Viktor: And if I may add, we the Fatui had nothing to do with this disaster.
Viktor: So please refrain from pointing fingers and tarnishing the Fatui's reputation when this all goes down!
