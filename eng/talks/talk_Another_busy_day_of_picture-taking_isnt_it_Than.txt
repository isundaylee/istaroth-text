Asagiri: Another busy day of picture-taking, isn't it? Thank you so much.
Asagiri: Speaking of which, I met a writer whom I'd drawn illustrations for.
Asagiri: He says he's writing a novel with the theme of sword fighting and is looking for someone to design the costumes and scenes for him.
Traveler: How do you find his novels?
Asagiri: Hmm... He's an excellent writer. His editor says he's like a poet.
Asagiri: Wonder if he's in the poet mode when writing this novel...
