Traveler: What is this place?
Sareh: This inn was opened by my father, and I am the hostess.
Sareh: If you would like to stay here, please register your name, number of guests, reason for your stay, and number of days you'll be staying.
Sareh: Oh, of course. If you don't want to leave your information, that's fine too. The registration is just for us to provide you with better service.
Sareh: By the way, you can use the elevator in front of the inn whether you're a guest or not, so you don't have to climb up the long incline.
Sareh: But if you're afraid of heights, there's nothing we can do...
Sareh: Oh yes, did you see a researcher with messy hair and dirty clothes on the way here?
