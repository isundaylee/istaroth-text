Traveler: What's up with Brek?
Debal: All he does is slack off and try to make a quick profit through shady dealings.
Debal: Last time, he got duped into buying and reselling dried Bulle Fruit, and ended up falling into serious debt. Now he's got creditors hounding him day in and day out.
Debal: Even with things being as bad as they've gotten, he still won't consider taking up honest work to pay off his debt. Instead, he keeps going on about pulling off some "major deal" and hitting it big.
Debal: He should have known what he was getting into. He originally wanted me to go in on the loan with him, but unlike him, I'm no fool.
