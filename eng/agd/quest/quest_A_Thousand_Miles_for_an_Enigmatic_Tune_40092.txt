# A Thousand Miles for an Enigmatic Tune


## Talk 1

Paimon: Time flies so fast! Before you know it, Lantern Rite's almost here again.
Paimon: The people of Liyue must've already started preparing for their most important festival of the year, right? Hopefully, Paimon will be able to check out tons of great food again this year!
Paimon: Anyway, let's go to Liyue Harbor and see what's up!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Bamboo Shoot... Bamboo Shoot... "Nascent" Bamboo Shoot...
Paimon: Oh! This one's only just sprouted, and it looks super fresh. Paimon thinks this is the one!

## Talk 3

Dvorak: Wow, Liyue Harbor looks very different from when I came last...
Dvorak: It's almost as if... I'm listening to the same melody, but with a richer timbre, and new variations added...
Paimon: Well, we are here during Lantern Rite, after all! It only comes once a year, so they always have a big celebration.
Paimon: It's fair to say that this time of year is when Liyue Harbor looks the prettiest!
Dvorak: Great. Let's go and check it out.
Dvorak: I can't wait to get into the city and see it all up close for myself.

## Talk 4

Paimon: The doors and windows are all fine, so there definitely wasn't a break-in...

## Talk 5

Paimon: This place is completely empty... There's nothing valuable left here at all...

## Talk 6

Dvorak: The streets are breathtaking...
Dvorak: Smiles and laughter everywhere I look... it's contagious.
Dvorak: I can almost feel the music in the air... I have the urge to start waving my conductor's baton...
Yaoyao: Hee-hee... I'm glad that you're enjoying the city!

## Talk 7

Paimon: So, about this "senior" of yours Xinyan mentioned just now... is that anyone we know?
Yaoyao: Yes, it's Xiangling. She's mentioned you two before.
Yaoyao: Xiangling's always thinking about cooking... Whenever she gets scrapes or burns, she just leaves them to heal by themselves. She definitely needs someone around her to look after her.
Yaoyao: I know you must have looked out for her a lot too in the time you've known her. So thank you for that.

## Talk 8

Dvorak: I was wondering, what are your thoughts on music? What does it mean to you?
Paimon: Uhh... Music... sounds... nice?
Dvorak: Heh... truth be told, the question of what music means to people is one that I've been pondering for quite some time...
Dvorak: Let's revisit this question after the concert.

## Talk 9

Yelan: Here, look at this.
Yelan: These tracks are superficial, but they definitely didn't occur naturally. Something heavy was being dragged this way... meaning, we're headed in the right direction.

## Talk 10

Yelan: Huh, their pace has increased... Normally, people carrying a heavy load slow down as their journey goes on and they start to tire.
Yelan: Whatever's motivating them to speed up must be psychological. For instance... reaching the home stretch.

## Talk 11

Paimon: Baiwen said the strange tune was coming from around here, right?
Paimon: But Paimon doesn't hear anything... There doesn't seem to be a soul in—
Yelan: I was just wondering who in their right mind would come out to a place like this. So, it's you two.
Paimon: Yelan!? How did you sneak up on us like that? You nearly gave Paimon a heart attack!
Yelan: You look pretty alive to me. Can't have spooked you that bad.
Paimon: Y—You... ehh, fair enough...
Traveler: Know anything about the strange music?
Yelan: Ah, you're here for that, too? Saves me a bit of explaining.
Yelan: Come with me. I've already reconned the perimeter, so we should be safe.

## Talk 12

Madame Ping: You mustn't be afraid to try new things. If you never try, you'll never know.
Madame Ping: With your contribution, I'm sure this year's Lantern Rite will be a most spectacular one.

## Talk 13

Paimon: Hm, the stuff by the door is in pretty good condition, though. It can't have been too long ago that someone was last living here...

## Talk 14

Paimon: Hmm, how strange. It looks like it's been looted, except for the fact that there's no sign of a struggle.
Paimon: The bad guys could have sneaked in while the owner was gone, but... then how do you explain why the door and windows are intact?
Yelan: Seems you've done a pretty thorough inspection. So, any theories on what might have happened here?
Paimon: Yelan, you didn't hide some of the evidence from us on purpose, did you?
Yelan: Why would I make this more difficult for you? We're on the same side here.
Paimon: Okay, well... Paimon gives up then. Paimon's got nothin'.
Yelan: What about you? Give up as well?
Traveler: It's difficult to theorize with so little evidence.
Yelan: Yup. It's not obvious at first sight, that's for sure.
Yelan: To be honest, I was only able to put it all together because of some background knowledge about this area.
Yelan: A long time ago, there used to be a group of bandits in the Liyue countryside who would sound a horn every time they were about to raid a village.
Yelan: But it wasn't a rallying cry to rouse their fellow men. It was a disconcerting tune, meant to intimidate the weak and warn them of their impending doom.
Yelan: To escape with their lives, the villagers would abandon their homes and flee overnight, taking only their most valuable belongings with them. Everything else was left behind.
Yelan: The bandits were eventually brought to justice. But the fear and trauma remained in the villagers' hearts.
Yelan: Whenever they heard that melody, they would feel like their lives were in danger once again, and flee immediately.
Yelan: The culprit of this crime exploited that very fear to get access to this house without having to force their way in.
Paimon: Whew, that's quite the story...
Yelan: The victims obviously will have gotten quite a fright, but at least they won't be in any great danger.
Yelan: The important thing now is to find this copycat criminal.
Traveler: If we use Elemental Sight...
Yelan: On any other day, that'd probably be a good idea. Unfortunately, it's not gonna work today.
Yelan: Take a look around and you'll see what I mean. This criminal is clearly well-versed both in using music to commit crimes and in making a clean getaway.
Yelan: Not only did they stay off the muddy road to avoid leaving footprints, it looks like they were also careful not to bring any gadgets with so much as a trace of elemental energy. Evidently, they were intent on keeping even the most experienced investigators off their trail.
Yelan: Unfortunately for them, I'm one of the best trackers in the business. They're not about to get away with their little scheme on my watch.
Paimon: So basically... if we wanna find the culprit, we just need to follow Yelan!
Yelan: Mm-hmm. As long as you can keep up.
Yelan: Since the culprit's trying to be cautious and low-risk, I'll bet they left through an area with some vegetation for cover — but not so much that it would slow them down.
Traveler: We could follow their tracks...
Traveler: It must have something to do with that melody...
Yelan: Your instincts are pretty good.
Yelan: Hmm, or perhaps it's not instinct. The strange melody is one of the few pieces of information you have available, after all.
Yelan: Let me share a folk story with you.

## Talk 15

Paimon: There they are! Look, a Treasure Hoarder tent!
Paimon: Ugh, not the Treasure Hoarders again! And so close to Lantern Rite, too... 'Tis not the season for their antics!
Yelan: C'mon, let's round 'em up.

## Talk 16

Fujing: Hey! Who are you? Where'd you come from?
Yelan: Hmm... the evidence is conclusive.
Yelan: Okay — confess, and we'll go easy on you. My patience is running low, so why don't you do us both a favor, hmm?
Fujing: You kidding me!? You think I'm scared of you?
Yelan: Perhaps not. But you should be.

## Talk 17

Fujing: Mercy, have mercy...
Yelan: Ooh, it's a little late for that... I've come this far, I might as well finish the job.
Fujing: I surrender! I surrender, please! I'll do whatever you say! Please have mercy...
Yelan: Hmph. Tell us everything.
Yelan: You have one chance, and I'm warning you: Don't make me ask twice...
Fujing: I won't! I swear!
Fujing: Um, y'know, so... Lantern Rite's nearly here, and like a lot of people, I wanted to buy a few nice things...
Fujing: I know I'm with the Treasure Hoarders and everything, but I don't really have any kind of experience with robbing people and whatnot, so I, uh... I don't have the guts to break into somebody's house.
Paimon: Wow, you're really going to complain to us about that?
Fujing: No, not at all. I'm just... telling it how it is.
Yelan: Mkay. Continue.
Fujing: I racked my brains trying to think of what I could do, and eventually I remembered something from back when I was a kid. The bandits would blow their horn, and my grandma would grab us kids and run...
Fujing: I remember the tune, so I... I figured I'd try it for myself. ...I mean, just to see what would happen! At first, anyway... I seriously didn't expect that family to pack up and leave...
Fujing: But they did, and they just left all their stuff right there for the taking. It was too easy, I just... I couldn't resist...
Fujing: It was completely wrong of me, I know that now. I'll return everything that I took — it's all still in perfect condition. It'll be like it was never gone... Please, gimme a chance, huh? Let me make it right...
Yelan: Give you a chance, huh? Sounds to me like you'd rather strike some kind of a deal... than spend Lantern Rite behind bars?
Fujing: Y—Yes, um... yes...
Yelan: You know how to bargain, I'll give you that. It's just a pity that you didn't confess at the first opportunity.
Yelan: You'll have to take a walk with me.
Yelan: Once we've returned the goods, we'll find the owner of the house, and you can apologize to them in person. After that, I'll escort you to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Fujing: Yes, Ma'am!
Yelan: You know, as a former victim of this kind of crime yourself, I doubt anyone understands the fear you inflicted quite as well as you do.
Yelan: Does your greed matter more to you than your fear? More to the point, if you can play a tune from memory, don't you think you should be capable of making an honest living?
Fujing: You mean...
Yelan: Heh, that's enough hints for you. You'll have plenty of time to reflect on all of this yourself.
Yelan: There's not much left to wrap up, so I'll take it from here. Guess this is where I'll say goodbye.
Traveler: Sure.
Yelan: ...Hmm...
Paimon: What is it? Is there something else?
Yelan: I'm still not sure how you first got your hands on this information, so play it safe when you get back. Don't mention to anyone that you ran into me out here.
Yelan: You helped a lot with the investigation and arrest anyway, so it's perfectly fair for you to get all the credit. Just take it — it works better for me too.
Yelan: See you when I see you. And Happy Lantern Rite.
Paimon: Yelan's such a pro at this. With her taking it from here, it's as good as resolved.
Paimon: Fwoosh! Random Event: "A Strange Melody" complete!
Paimon: Although... it's kind of a shame that we never got that Treasure Hoarder guy to play the melody again.
Traveler: Why's it a shame?
Paimon: 'Cause Paimon's curious, that's why! It's like when you have a tune stuck in your head, but you don't even know what it is. It's driving Paimon crazy!
Paimon: When we were chatting with Mr. Dvorak, music seemed like such a positive thing.
Paimon: And most music is, right? It can help us relax, feel all warm and fuzzy, recall happy memories, or even just think happy thoughts...
Paimon: Paimon never imagined that music could be used to commit crimes...
Traveler: It comes down to the ill will of the user...
Paimon: Oh, really? Huh... Makes sense... Paimon's musical understanding improves again!
Paimon: Well anyway, now that everything's resolved, let's get back to Liyue Harbor. Baiwen's still waiting for us with our Random Event rewards!
Traveler: Their bad deeds influenced the emotions associated with the music.
Traveler: I'm quite curious myself.
Paimon: Right? How could anyone not be!
Traveler: Well done, Yelan!

## Talk 18

Paimon: Baiwen~! We're back. Everything's all sorted!
Baiwen: That's great news! Please wait here a moment, if you would be so kind. Lady Ningguang instructed me to advise her upon your return...
Black Screen Text: Baiwen hurries off...
Ningguang: My greetings to the both of you. Long time no see.
Paimon: No need to be so formal with us, Ningguang! We've known each other for a long time now. You must be super busy with all the preparations for Lantern Rite. Don't mind us!
Ningguang: On the contrary, I think it is those that I have known longest to whom I should extend the greatest courtesies.
Ningguang: Alas, on a different day, I would invite both of you inside for some tea, and a brief respite from your travels...
Ningguang: But you're quite right: Trivial matters aside, there's no escaping the fact that we have a grand concert to organize.
Ningguang: Once the performance itself is over, we'll then need to invite the representatives of the Iridescence Tour for a discussion on future collaboration opportunities. The financing arrangements alone could well entail many rounds of discussion.
Ningguang: Simply put, there will always be work to do.
Paimon: Whoa... you're already thinking that far ahead?
Ningguang: Hehe... well, we can discuss more current affairs if you'd prefer.
Ningguang: I trust you saw this year's Mingxiao Lantern at the docks when you arrived at the city?
Paimon: Yeah! It looked like... a goose? Which adeptus is it modeled on this time?
Ningguang: Sea Gazer. I believe you're familiar with the name?
Ningguang: Legend holds that he was free-spirited and easy-going. People described him as a cheerful soul and a loyal friend.
Traveler: I remember.
Ningguang: "On this marvelous Lantern Rite, we pray that the fallen heroes may be guided home."
Ningguang: If the sound of music can flow like the rivers and streams into every corner of the land, perhaps the souls of those who have gone before us will hear the song of a new era. I wonder whether the melodies will be to their liking...
Paimon: Oh, they're gonna love them! Paimon's sure of it!
Paimon: At least, if the guy you mentioned is anything to go by, the adepti and heroes of the past sound like a positive and free-spirited cheerful bunch. They're sure to be open to new music!
Ningguang: Hehe, well let's hope so.
Ningguang: I heard that you'll be going on a search with Ganyu to find the descendants of a fairy lady from a Fontaine legend.
Ningguang: I'm sure this quest to uncover the truth behind an ancient story will turn into a most charming tale... Do share it with me, won't you? I couldn't bear to miss out.
Traveler: Absolutely.
Traveler: It's been too long, I can't seem to recall...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Zhongli: As for Director Hu's list... Hmm...
Zhongli: I shall attend to it after one last round of tea.

### Additional Talk 2

Dvorak: That lady I just talked to, Ganyu... she really thinks of everything.
Dvorak: It got me wondering... could it be that all our failed attempts so far have been down to our failure to properly prepare for different contingencies?

### Additional Talk 3

Keqing: ...She said she'll reach out to the Yun-Han Opera Troupe? I see.
Keqing: Then I'll arrange for a rehearsal venue and accommodation as soon as possible. Everything should be ready tonight.
Dvorak: Many thanks, Keqing.
Dvorak: Heh... You know, I once heard someone from Liyue describe a person as "swift as lightning and agile as the wind." At the time, I thought it was a curious expression, and I had a hard time piecing together a mental image of such a person.
Dvorak: But now, having seen Keqing in action, I honestly can't think of any other way to describe it... It's such a vivid and expressive phrase. A testament to the richness of Liyue's culture.
Keqing: You're too kind, Mr. Dvorak.

### Additional Talk 4

Dvorak: Program... list of performers... dress rehearsal schedule, and rehearsal venue...
Dvorak: What a spectacular stage we have... I have to make sure that the performances will be nothing short of exceptional.
