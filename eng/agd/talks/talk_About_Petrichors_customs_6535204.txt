Traveler: About Petrichor's customs...
Tiepolo: Petrichor is a romantic, idyllic place. People respect custom and are customarily polite and friendly to outside guests.
Tiepolo: Of course, some of us go a little overboard, and as a result may seem almost... wary, perhaps.
Tiepolo: But do forgive us. Petrichor is far from the Court of Fontaine, and people here have hardly ever left the town.
Tiepolo: Just as a stone thrown into an ancient well can stir up ripples, people always fear that outlanders may disturb our peace.
Tiepolo: So please, do not hold it against them!
