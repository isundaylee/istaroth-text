It took three betrayals for me to finally understand:
The world is just an elaborate tapestry of lies
My fury will never be quelled
The first to betray me was a god
My creator... my mother
Valuing strength above all, she saw no worth in me, and I was discarded
The second was a human
My family... my friend
Consumed by fear, he saw me as an abomination
The third was one exactly like me
A hope for the future... a fledgling barely out of the nest
Powerless before his mortality, he broke his promise to me
Humans... they can't be trusted. And the gods fill me with pure loathing
So I said good riddance! I denounce the world and laugh in its face
My chest will never again be defiled by worldly filth
I will scrub away every last trace of human emotion
Then it will be empty, a blank slate
And ready to receive a supreme Gnosis, brimming with pure divinity
Hehehe... Ahahahaha!
There is no need to fear. The pain will be brief...
Your era... is coming to an end
