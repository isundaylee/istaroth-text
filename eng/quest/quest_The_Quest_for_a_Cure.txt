# The Quest for a Cure


## Talk 1

Baizhu: #Traveler! Paimon! Come quick!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Baizhu's not gonna use Changsheng's secret art again, is he...
Paimon: Is there really no other way to save Jialiang?

## Talk 3

Observe Stack of Wood: (The firewood is neatly stacked, and the logs were cut with great power and precision. Whoever chopped the firewood must have been physically fit.)
Observe Stack of Wood: (...Some logs at the bottom of the pile have begun to rot. It must have been a while since any new wood was added to the pile.)

## Talk 4

Diary With Childish Handwriting: "...Some roof tiles broke. Mom and I tried to get up and take a look, but we didn't manage. Luckily, dad was able to fix them in no time!"
Diary With Childish Handwriting: "...The dinner table was a bit wobbly today when we sat down to eat... Dad tried to fix it, but ended up breaking one of the legs by accident..."
Diary With Childish Handwriting: "...Dad's forgetting things again. I'll have to write it all down for now, and read it back to him when he's feeling a bit better..."

## Talk 5

Traveler: ...
Traveler: ...Xiao?
Xiao: You called?
Paimon: Waaah!
Paimon: ...Ugh, gets Paimon every time!
Baizhu: ...Are all adepti in the habit of materializing out of thin air like this?
Baizhu: ...Well, this is unexpected.
Xiao: ...Huh? It's you?
Baizhu: Baizhu, of Bubu Pharmacy. I do believe I've had the pleasure before.
Baizhu: ...The Lantern Rite when we met briefly, I was unaware of your true identity. I... must apologize for the discourtesy.
Paimon: Huh? You two already know each other?
Xiao: Our paths have crossed once before.
Xiao: ...I sense the presence of evil spirits. Is this why you called me?
Traveler: Let me explain...
Black Screen Text: You tell Xiao everything that has happened...
Xiao: So someone has been concocting demonic poison...
Xiao: Too often, fervent desires drive mortals to abandon all regard for their own safety... It is lamentable.
Xiao: I now know what you seek. It is true that a god's remains are buried beneath the foundations of Qingce Village.
Xiao: A vile monster known as the Chi once wrought havoc over this land, before it was subdued by Rex Lapis...
Xiao: The land was finally cleansed of poison when Rex Lapis used statues in his likeness to seal the serpent's remains. Qingce Village was founded sometime after that.
Xiao: The seal is still mostly intact. If the Chi is the source, then it must be some of its blood leaking from deep underground.
Xiao: However... its aura is faint and barely detectable. You will need to investigate further to identify the location of the leak.
Traveler: ...I see.
Xiao: I do not like to intervene against mortals unless absolutely necessary.
Xiao: But when demonic forces are involved, things can spiral out of control... If that happens, be sure to call my name again.
Traveler: I will.
Xiao: ...
Baizhu: ...Hmm?
Xiao: ...Nothing.
Xiao: I do not wish to sway decisions that are mortals' to make, but...
Xiao: ...Immortality may not be the blessing that you imagine it to be.
Baizhu: ...I shall treasure your words of instruction, Master Adeptus.
Xiao: Farewell.
Baizhu: What a strange adeptus... Rather different from the way I remember them.
Paimon: That's Xiao for ya! And thanks to him, we've finally got some concrete info to go off of.
Baizhu: If the god remains are leaking from underground, Jiangli must be paying a visit to a subterranean cave on her "herb gathering" trips. If we can find the cave...
Herbalist Gui: Mas... Master! *panting* Master — there's a problem!
Paimon: Gui? ...Did you run all the way from Bubu Pharmacy?
Baizhu: What happened? Don't panic, just catch your breath, and tell me everything.
Herbalist Gui: It's... It's Jialiang...
Herbalist Gui: He was... he was fine one minute, and then... he suddenly took a turn for the worse!
Baizhu: Already? How?
Baizhu: Based on past experience, he should have been fine for the next three days at least...
Baizhu: ...It seems that my worst fears have been confirmed.
Baizhu: Everyone, back to Bubu Pharmacy, now!
Traveler: Thank you, Xiao.
Traveler: Actually, I wanted to ask you about dead gods...
Traveler: Xiao, are you there?

## Talk 6

Paimon: Wh—What is this?
Baizhu: Changsheng and I found a hidden compartment... This is what was hidden inside.
Traveler: ...God remains?
Baizhu: Ah, you sense it too? You're right — this is a poison concocted using god remains.
Paimon: Uh... Is it... breathing? Paimon's not seeing things, is she?
Baizhu: No, your eyes do not deceive you. I do believe the poison in this bottle is... alive.
Traveler: "Alive"?
Baizhu: Some toxins act a lot like living organisms... I read about this once in "The Origins and Symptoms of Diseases." This ancient class of poisons consists of "mother" and "minor" lodes, capable of sustaining a connection over vast distances.
Baizhu: If it's a concoction of this kind we're dealing with, then both the poison in Jialiang's system and this one here are likely minor lodes... offshoots, essentially.
Paimon: Offshoots? So... the main body is somewhere else?
Baizhu: Correct. Whoever is administering the poison can manipulate the source to indirectly control the poisoned individual's behavior and even cognition. Similarly, the poisoned individual will hear, to a varying extent, the call of the source.
Paimon: The call of the... Wait! So back when Jialiang ran off, maybe that explains where he was heading!
Traveler: ...He was going back towards Qingce Village!
Baizhu: Only one thing could've been drawing him there. The source of the god remains used as the poison's key ingredient... the mother lode.
Paimon: Ugh, this is getting crazier and crazier! What kind of person would do all this just to poison Jialiang?
Baizhu: ...
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Hey... Why's everyone gone quiet all of a sudden?
Baizhu: ...Since this poison was carefully hidden away in a secret compartment, the one who concocted it is likely a resident of the house.
Paimon: You mean, Jialiang? Why would he poison himself?
Baizhu: Think a little harder, Paimon. Someone else who lives here... and who might have expertise in crafting drugs...
Paimon: Huh? So you're saying... *gasp* It was Jiangli!?
Paimon: Wait, but that doesn't make any sense either! Why would she poison her own husband?
Baizhu: ...I agree, it makes little sense. Jiangli does not strike me as the kind of person who would do such a thing.
Baizhu: Look at the facts, though. How many people in the entirety of Liyue have the ability to concoct a poison from god remains?
Baizhu: ...It's too early to draw any conclusions. We should question Jialiang about it once he has made more progress in his recovery.
Traveler: Do you know of a method to neutralize the poison?
Baizhu: Yes. According to "The Origins and Symptoms of Diseases," the minor lodes will disappear if the mother lode is purged...
Baizhu: So, if we can find and destroy the source of these god remains, the poison will leave Jialiang's system without the need for any further treatment.
Baizhu: Do you know anything about god remains in Qingce Village?
Traveler: I've only heard the rumors...
Baizhu: *sigh* Even the history books have no record of this. The only ones who'll know anything are those old fogeys who've been hanging around here since the beginning of time.
Paimon: Hmm? Didn't you use to be on good terms with the adepti, though? You sure they didn't tell you anything about this?
Baizhu: Well, uh... Ahem...
Baizhu: Changsheng's memories and powers are not what they were in her prime.
Baizhu: These days, she has to enter a contract with a mortal and share their life force just to sustain her own life. I fear that such ancient events are long gone from her memory by now.
Paimon: ...Whoa, what? Enter a contract? Share life force? Sounds like some pretty spooky sorcery if you ask Paimon...
Baizhu: Hey! Plenty of people would jump at the chance to join forces with a powerful being like me!
Baizhu: With my assistance in rebalancing your qi, not only can you extend your lifespan, but you will also be stronger, healthier, and able to eat whatever you like with no risk of upsetting your stomach!
Paimon: Stronger and healthier? Wow, that's amazing...
Paimon: Hehe, Baizhu, maybe when you retire, you can let Paimon sign a contract with Changsheng for a few days, hee-hee...
Baizhu: Unfortunately, Changsheng's contract has strict requirements regarding the host's temperament. None of her hosts have ever been exempted from these rules. I fear that I will be unable to accommodate your wishes, Paimon.
Paimon: ...Temperament? Hey, what are you trying to say? Did you just subtly insult Paimon to her face?
Traveler: (Strange, Baizhu has a weak constitution...)
Traveler: (And didn't his master pass away at an early age?)
Paimon: Ughhhh... Paimon's mad! You're getting ugly nicknames, both of you! Baizhu, you're Mannequin Man! Changsheng, you're just... a Pain in the Neck!
Baizhu: This is exactly why your natural temperament makes you woefully unsuited to being my host!
Baizhu: Alright, everybody, calm down. Back to the matter at hand. Is there any way at all for us to seek counsel from the adepti about this?
Baizhu: Hmph, with how antisocial they are? If it were up to them, they'd go their whole lives without showing their faces to the common folk...
Traveler: Actually...
Baizhu: What?
Baizhu: #Seems you're as well-connected as they say, Traveler. We are truly fortunate to have you on our side.
Paimon: Oh... If you're talking about who Paimon thinks you're talking about... you'd better do the honors.
Traveler: I do have someone that I can call.
Traveler: Nothing concrete...

## Talk 7

Ayu: Dad! What's wrong? Dad...
Jialiang: Ugh... Urghhh...
Qiqi: Don't be scared, Dr. Baizhu will be back soon...
Baizhu: How is he doing?
Ayu: Dr. Baizhu, you're back! My dad was doing fine earlier, but then he suddenly started coughing up blood! Now, he can't even get a full word out anymore...
Qiqi: When Gui left, he was still conscious. But now...
Baizhu: ...Gui, please take Jialiang to the back room and prepare for treatment.
Herbalist Gui: Yes, of course!
Baizhu: Don't worry, Ayu. I will cure your father.

## Talk 8

Baizhu: How time flies... Jiangli's had a son, and he's all grown up...
Baizhu: I wonder if Jiangli's changed at all, after all these years?

## Talk 9

Ayu: How are you feeling, Dad? Are you still hurting anywhere? You're not gonna suddenly collapse again, are you...?
Jialiang: Much better, Ayu, I'm feeling much better. In fact... I can't explain it, but somehow I feel even better than usual.
Jialiang: Hmm? Wait... Where's Dr. Baizhu? I still haven't had a chance to thank him... Seems he moved me here before I came to.
Herbalist Gui: Master said he needed to take a quick rest, and asked me to bring you out of the treatment room... He hasn't emerged yet, so he must still be resting.
Traveler: ...
Jialiang: Oh, really? ...Well, he must be tired from treating me for two nights in a row.
Jialiang: *sigh* I don't know how I can begin to repay him for saving my life. I'll have to discuss it properly with Jiangli once we find her...
Jialiang: Hmm... Speaking of which, has there been any word of her whereabouts yet?
Ayu: No, the Adventurers' Guild hasn't gotten back to me yet. I'll go check with them again in a bit.
Jialiang: I'll come with— Ugh!
Herbalist Gui: Don't forget what Master said — you're still not out of the woods yet, Jialiang. I strongly suggest that you stay and rest at Bubu Pharmacy for now. I can accompany Ayu to the Adventurers' Guild.
Jialiang: ...*sigh* I suppose you're right... I'll have to rely on you this time.
Jialiang: Though, on the bright side, this means I can thank Dr. Baizhu in person once he's finished resting...
Paimon: #Traveler, Baizhu hasn't shown his face ever since he went in to treat Jialiang again. Do you think he...
Traveler: ...Let's go check up on him.
Paimon: Huh? Hey, wait up!

## Talk 10

Baizhu: ...
Baizhu: ...You're finally awake? Phew. That was far too risky, even with me here to help you balance your qi.
Baizhu: ...There was no time, I had no other choice. In any case, it was not completely without benefit to myself — I managed to learn something.
Baizhu: Jiangli's design is quite brilliant. She makes numerous innovations that I can learn from... Alas, if only there wasn't a catch.
Paimon: ...So, how much longer do you think Baizhu's gonna nap for?
Baizhu: They've been outside waiting for you the whole time while you were asleep. Shall we at least go and show our faces?
Baizhu: ...Alright.

## Talk 11

Paimon: Surely he hasn't... There's no way he could've just—
Baizhu: Who's talking behind our backs again?
Paimon: Ah! Baizhu! Changsheng!
Traveler: Are you both okay?
Baizhu: Of course, there's no need to be concerned. I merely had to transfer a rather large amount of life force on this occasion. But with Changsheng's help, I will recover in time.
Paimon: Jialiang seemed fine yesterday. Why did he need more life-saving treatment again so soon?
Baizhu: I made an error in my initial diagnosis. Jialiang is in fact suffering from more than one ailment.
Baizhu: ...And as a result, his life force depleted at a greater rate than I had anticipated.
Paimon: What? You mean, even if you got all the poison out of him... he'd still be sick?
Baizhu: Yes... but more pertinently, the poison in Jialiang's system is there precisely because it is being used to manage his underlying medical condition.
Baizhu: Jialiang has a rare congenital heart condition, and ongoing treatment is essential to maintaining healthy functioning of his heart meridian. Left untreated, it puts the patient at risk of coughing up blood and fainting, and in the longer term, causes irreversible damage to the internal organs.
Baizhu: Though it was created from god remains, this formula is not a poison in Jialiang's case. Rather, it's his medication.
Baizhu: Had he not taken it all these years, he likely would have died a long time ago.
Traveler: So that's why Jiangli did it...
Baizhu: Still, using poison to treat a disease is hardly a viable long-term solution. As time passed, and the poison accumulated in his system, it began to impact his cognition.
Baizhu: Moreover, the longer he relied upon this medicine, the more resistant his body became to it. Jiangli had to concoct ever greater quantities to ensure its continued efficacy, or he could have still perished at any moment.
Paimon: That explains why Ayu said his dad has been getting worse... and why his mom went off to "gather herbs"...
Baizhu: God remains are extremely dangerous to be around, because humans have no natural defense against them. I shudder to think how many times Jiangli has exposed herself to them...
Baizhu: I fear that the situation is just as that adeptus described... In an effort to save Jialiang's life, Jiangli has abandoned all regard for her own safety.
Baizhu: I never suspected that even Jiangli would turn to the same path as so many others over the years... Perhaps this is the inevitable course of fate...
Baizhu: To sacrifice one's own life to save others... To go beyond human means in order to do the impossible, whatever the cost may be...
Traveler: "Fate"...?
Baizhu: ...Well, I think that it's too early to say with any certainty what fate has in mind.
Baizhu: In any case, I have stabilized Jialiang's condition for now, so our immediate priority should be to get ourselves back to Qingce Village and find out where Jiangli is.
Baizhu: Her regular exposure to god remains over such a long period will have been catastrophic for her health.
Baizhu: And given that she's already been missing for several days... I am fearing the worst.
Traveler: !
Jialiang: ...I—It's me, Traveler, Dr. Baizhu.
Paimon: Ah, it's Jialiang! ...Don't tell Paimon you overheard everything already...
Jialiang: Dr. Baizhu... Please let me come with you!
Jialiang: You have already done so much for my family. I can no longer just sit here and watch while you put yourself at risk for Jiangli's sake.
Jialiang: After all, if it wasn't for me, she wouldn't have had to put herself in harm's way in the first place... I know I won't be of much help in battle, but at the very least, I can show you the way.
Jialiang: ...I'm sure I'll be able to remember, I know there's a spot where she says goodbye to me every time she goes to "gather her herbs." I'm sure I'll remember... I—I have to remember! Ugh... *cough*
Baizhu: Be careful! If you get too agitated, your blood pressure and stress levels will rise, putting further pressure on your heart... For your own safety, you should stay here and rest.
Jialiang: No! We're out of time! We have to go now... right now...
Jialiang: Before I forget everything again...!
Baizhu: *sigh*...
Baizhu: ...This trip will be extremely dangerous, and there is a very real possibility that you will not return from it... Are you sure you're prepared for that?
Jialiang: Hah... I never expected to live this long in the first place. My death is already long overdue... So why should I fear it?
Jialiang: There's only one thing I fear now... and that's that I'll forget her again before we manage to find her...
Baizhu: ...Very well. Then, follow me.
Qiqi: Dr. Baizhu, are you heading out again?
Baizhu: Yes... This could be a long one... Could you please prepare a dose of the usual formula?
Baizhu: Please add an extra measure of Mist Grass Pollen, and one dose each of the ingredients from the third and fifth compartments of my medicine cabinet... I hope it works.
Qiqi: Dr. Baizhu... Do you mean...
Baizhu: Hop to it, now. And remember to be careful with the cauldron this time... You don't want to burn yourself again.
Qiqi: ...Okay.
Traveler: ...Who's that?

Herbalist Gui: Are you heading out now, Dr. Baizhu?

Hu Tao: Huh... Fancy running into you guys at a place like this. What are the chances!
Traveler: What are you doing here?
Hu Tao: Uh, nothing? I was just battling against some writer's block, so I took a stroll to see if I could get my muse back... Mm... mm, yep, i—it's working... "Stealthy as a snake, she can hear them coming, plants a little bait, and they all come running"...
Traveler: Won't your continued absence affect Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's business?
Hu Tao: It's fine, I have someone taking care of the books while I'm gone... Hold up, now that you mention it, I probably shouldn't stick around here too long...
Traveler: Still worried about what Baizhu's up to?
Hu Tao: ...You'd better not snitch on me, okay?

### Additional Talk 4

Jialiang: *sigh* Your mother's been missing for days now, but here I am, sitting here and doing nothing...
