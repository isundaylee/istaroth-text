# Summer Gift


## Talk 1

Investigate: This should be it!
Investigate: Hmm? Looks like there's a letter next to it, too...
Investigate: To a friend who may have the fortune to come here,
Investigate: Hello there, person from afar. If you're reading this letter, then you must have found the harpastum I left here.
Investigate: The Golden Apple Archipelago is full of many games that involve harpasta, and I and my friends spent a most wonderful summer here.
Investigate: As such, I've left a harpastum that I made myself here, in the hopes that you, who have found that harpastum, can experience the same joys as I.
Investigate: Please enjoy the sunshine, the sea breeze, and the summer games to fullest.
Investigate: â€”Barbara
Investigate: Well, that's Barbara for you! Guess we've got ourselves a harpastum now, so come on, let's go play!
