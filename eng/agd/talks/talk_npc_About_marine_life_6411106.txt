Traveler: About marine life...
Araby: They're mainly sea monsters. A group of mysterious creatures that live in the sea and occasionally attack residents of coastal areas.
Araby: With the progress of my research, I've been able to predict roughly when they would appear and issue warnings.
Araby: As soon as the warning is issued, all ships will return to the harbor to avoid disturbing those sea creatures.
Araby: There are exceptions too, of course. A few days ago, I saw a ship leave the harbor after the warning was issued. I don't know if it came back safely.
Araby: Maybe some researcher planned on observing the sea when the sea monsters are out and about. I feel sorry for the people on the ship.
