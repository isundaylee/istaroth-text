# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Kamisato Ayato: #Have you ever taken a dog for a walk, Traveler?
Traveler: ...Taken a dog for a walk?
Kamisato Ayato: Yes. Where you stroll together with a canine companion.
Kamisato Ayato: Dogs are instinctually loyal. But no matter how well-behaved a dog might be, it gets unhappy if it's cooped up in the same place for too long.
Kamisato Ayato: Bringing it outdoors and watching it run free and enjoy itself is a splendid way to relax. It puts you in a good mood.
Kamisato Ayato: Don't you want to try?
Traveler: I'm a little nervous...
Kamisato Ayato: Don't worry. My staff will be sure to pick out a sufficiently docile dog for you.
Kamisato Ayato: Failing that... There's always Taroumaru.
Traveler: Alright, I guess I can give it a try.
Kamisato Ayato: Alright then. If you have any reservations starting out, we can treat this as a practice area.
Kamisato Ayato: Once you've reached the point where you're able to enjoy it, we can head out onto the streets.
Kamisato Ayato: Drinking some milk tea and walking the dogs... I wouldn't be surprised if it causes some commotion.
Kamisato Ayato: Heh, not that I mind, of course.
Traveler: Sure!
Kamisato Ayato: Heh, raring to go, I see.
