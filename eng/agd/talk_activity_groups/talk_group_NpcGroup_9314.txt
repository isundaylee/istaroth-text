Sucrose: I wonder whether this potion I made has any potential combat applications...
Sucrose: Oh! Don't worry, I understand that this isn't an appropriate location to conduct those kinds of experiments... It's too risky, and might do more harm than good if something went wrong.
Sucrose: It's just... hard to switch off and rest when all these hypotheses are swirling around in my brain... *sigh*

Sucrose: What exactly lies in the deepest part of this domain? I actually have quite a few theories already...
Sucrose: But given all the monsters we keep finding, it looks like we have a tough road ahead before we can confirm the facts.
Sucrose: Still, it'll all be worth it as long as we find the answer in the end. At least... that's what I think.

Sucrose: I once read a story about a wonderful paradise. Later on in life, it was also books that got me interested in studying alchemy.
Sucrose: It's funny, but even now, that storybook about paradise and my alchemy textbooks are right next to each other on the bookshelf next to my bed...
Sucrose: One day, I hope to break down the barriers between those books by using bio-alchemy to create that paradise for real.
