# Missing title (3826336391)


## Talk 1

Traveler (Check Note): (Citlali, we found the books you were looking for. You were sleeping when we got here and we didn't want to wake you.)
Traveler (Check Note): (Maybe drink a little less next time, eh?)

## Talk 2

Traveler (Citlali's Bedroom): (The faint sound of Citlali snoring comes from within.)
Paimon: Was she drinking again last night? Paimon thinks we should leave the books on the table. She wouldn't want us to wake her.

## Talk 3

Traveler: Someone sent me to find a couple of books...
Black Screen Text: You describe the books that Citlali wants to Kuroda.
Kuroda: The first edition of "Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden With Unlimited Power" and the limited deluxe edition of "Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?"...
Kuroda: I must say, your friend clearly knows a thing or two. In terms of collection value, nothing the Yae Publishing House is currently putting out can rival the books you're after.
Kuroda: To think I'm not acquainted with such a discerning reader... Truly regrettable.
Traveler: Are they still available?
Kuroda: You won't find either of them on the open market, and certainly not in storage. Every copy was snapped up long ago.
Kuroda: However, I do happen to have a copy of each...
Traveler: I can pay you for them.
Kuroda: No, no. These books would be far better off in your friend's possession, someone who can appreciate their true worth.
Kuroda: Knowing that, I'd be more than happy to give them to you.

## Talk 4

Traveler: (Can I just put them here?)

## Talk 5

Paimon: We should probably write a message. Citlali might not even notice them in all this mess.
Black Screen Text: Paimon finds a piece of paper and thinks for a moment before writing a note.

## Talk 6

Traveler (Citlali's Bedroom): (The faint sound of Citlali snoring comes from within.)

## Talk 7

Traveler (Examine Bookshelf): (Two light novels have been placed carefully on the bookshelf. There's very little dust on the shelf, as though it has been tidied especially for them.)

## Talk 8

Traveler (Observe): (This light novel is sitting quietly on the table in pristine condition. Its new owner clearly hasn't been able to bring herself to read it, choosing to simply admire it instead. The area has been intentionally wiped clean, with not even so much as a speck of dust around it.)
