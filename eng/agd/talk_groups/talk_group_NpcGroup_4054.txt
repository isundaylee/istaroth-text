## Talk

Mawyo: To be an adventurer or travel with a caravan? Friend, please help me out!

## Talk

Traveler: And you are...
Mawyo: I'm a "freelancer." Just call me Mawyo.
Mawyo: Dad's been rattling a lot about what I'm doing, but I don't care. The benefits of being a freelancer are something those old fogeys like my dad and my brother wouldn't understand.
Mawyo: What to do, when to start, how much to earn... I call the shots. Isn't it amazing?

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry, I'm a little busy right now.
Mawyo: You wouldn't happen to be planning for something big? Count me in!

## Talk

Traveler: Is the income stable?
Mawyo: If you're a freelancer, you don't care about stability anymore.
Mawyo: See, I can rest for a long time as soon as I make a pile with an expedition team or a caravan.
Mawyo: It's easy to make a quick buck. With a little capital and a bit of luck, you can earn three months' money to pay for meals at the Kalimi Exchange.
Mawyo: Isn't this more proper than being an Akademiya researcher? I don't know what that old man is so worried about.
Mawyo: Those Invokation TCG cards command a ready market in Inazuma. I can trade those someday as well.
Mawyo: And my dad and Brother Sal won't let me starve to death even if there isn't a gig for me at the moment. So, please rest assured.

## Talk

Mawyo: Hello there! Buying coffee at night, aren't you? I guess you're a night owl just like me!

## Talk

Traveler: You are a night owl, too?
Mawyo: Of course I am! Nighttime is precious, and it'd be a waste if we didn't use it properly.
Mawyo: Look at this coffee shop. It's a very popular one, and has provided me with a great deal of precious intel.
Mawyo: Adventurers' commissions, clues to treasure maps, and business opportunities for new toys... Every piece of information contributes to my career as a freelancer.
Mawyo: Well, although the tavern might be a better source of information, I just can't hold my liquor. So I have to give up on it.

## Talk

Traveler: It's getting late. I should probably head back now.
Mawyo: Okay then... Maybe we'll have the chance to talk more next time.
