# Piping-Hot Bamboo Shoot Soup

Bamboo Shoot Soup created using the Supreme Cuisine Machine. Zhongli rated this dish as such: "The appearance is exquisite, and the aroma rich and intense." Among its key ingredients are Nascent Bamboo Shoots. They're hard to come by... And due to a multiplicity of reasons, their commemorative value far exceeds their worth as cooking ingredients. Since this meal was created by an adeptus, it shouldn't spoil even if you just leave it in your bag.
