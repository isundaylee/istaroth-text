Uncle Sun: Ah, another patron! Would you like to purchase some fish?
Uncle Sun: Things are different during Lantern Rite, let me tell you. Everything's super fresh! Lantern Rite-special-super-fresh, in fact!
Uncle Sun: It is the festive season, after all! People buy more, we import more, and the fish are all the fresher for it. Wouldn't you agree?
