Traveler: Did I scare you?
Asakura: Ah, you're the Traveler. How do you do? This is the side gate, and few people pass this way... so you really did give me a fright there, ahaha...
Asakura: This gate leads to the Tenshukaku, the residence of our Almighty Shogun, so please refrain from doing anything reckless here.
