# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Raiden Shogun: Yes. Unsheathe your weapon.
Traveler: Wait, you mean... now?
Raiden Shogun: Hmph. Then I will come again once your preparation is complete. I have time.
Raiden Shogun: I will use my blade to confirm whether you are out of practice or not.
Traveler: Wait, are you serious?
Raiden Shogun: Naturally.
Raiden Shogun: The moment that blades are crossed in battle also becomes a kind of Eternity. I shall use this moment to feel your inner being.
Raiden Shogun: A simple and direct method, yet more clear than any language could convey. It even allows me to verify my own existence.
Traveler: Something seems a bit off...
Raiden Shogun: Huh? So you could see through my guise? Oh. I thought my impression was accurate enough.
Raiden Shogun: Never mind. I'll be honest with you then, I desire to spar with you.
Raiden Shogun: After all, few have ever proved capable of withstanding my blade. It would be a pleasure to train with you.
Raiden Shogun: However, I feared that you would be hesitant to strike me, so I used the identity of the Shogun.
Traveler: There's no need to trick me into it...
Raiden Shogun: Ah, you don't refuse. May I assume you accept then?
Raiden Shogun: Hehe, you should prepare yourself. I certainly won't go easy on you.
Traveler: That's an odd request...
Traveler: Ei? Is that you?
Traveler: I'm not mentally prepared for this.
