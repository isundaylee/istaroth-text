# Three Realms Gateway Offering: Part I


## Talk 1

Yabe: First the darkness, then monsters, then patrol missions... Guess we're not going anywhere else any time soon.
Yabe: Maybe I'll go for a little adventure in the Dainichi Mikoshi when we change shifts.

## Talk 2

Traveler: About the three towers...
Tsumi: Each of the towers is positioned on top of a leyline junction, and they are used to maintain balance between vishaps, the Abyss, and humans.
Tsumi: After being modified by that person, they are currently enhancing the powers of the Abyss.

## Talk 3

Traveler: About you, Tsumi...
Tsumi: I am of little note.
Tsumi: Just one life among many. My present concerns are how to survive... and how to help my brethren.

## Talk 4

Traveler: About the Sentou...
Tsumi: The Sentou ceremony used to be used to chase vishaps away. This is the clash between the human and vishap realms.
Tsumi: Once the Daninichi Mikoshi was built, the Sentou ceremony was used less and less. However, as a secret art of the human realm, it can certainly still serve as an effective measure against the darkness.

## Talk 5

Traveler: I'm still working on it.
Tsumi: I look forward to your success.

## Talk 6

Kurai: I am the Jibashiri Kurai. Are you here to help solve the problem of these small orbs of thunder?
Traveler: What problem is that?
Kurai: Ah, yes, when I went to Narukami Island to conduct an exchange previously, I used a secret technique to capture some strange objects.
Kurai: I think the academic name for it is an Electro Seele. Or something.
Kurai: They fly all over the place, and numb all the people living here. It's quite vexing...
Traveler: What do you need solved?
Kurai: Well, the issue of those Electro Cells, of course.
Kurai: Between you and me, I have no idea what to do with them.
Kurai: Vishaps and villains, I can master, but these little gadgets are way beyond me.
Kurai: How am I supposed to stop them from moving?
Traveler: See you.
Kurai: See you. If you know how, please help me solve this electric ball problem.

## Talk 7

Tsumi: How are your efforts to clear the darkness away going?

## Talk 8

Ueno: The wounded are being evacuated swiftly. There's nothing to worry about on that front.
Ueno: But I fear that we haven't the strength to continue exploring and help you break through this darkness.
