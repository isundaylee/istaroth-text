Xiangling: Chefs can't be picky about location! No matter what kitchen appliances there are, I'll be back to cooking like I normally do after a few practice rounds!

Xiangling: Hmm... There isn't too much stocked here. I'll whip up some food for us, so could you go and help me buy some ingredients?
