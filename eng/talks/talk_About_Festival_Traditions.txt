Traveler: About Festival Traditions
Paimon: It's a well-established tradition that during Inazuman celebrations everyone's wearing festive masks.
Paimon: Paimon tried to look around the stalls, but hasn't found any mask that fits...
Traveler: So you really want a mask of your own?
Paimon: Of course! Not wearing a mask during an Inazuman festival is the same as not receiving a bouquet at the Windblume Festival...
Traveler: Let me make one for you.
Paimon: #Whoa! {NICKNAME}, you're the best!
Traveler: Hmmm, I wonder what kind of mask will fit you best?
Paimon: Yay, Paimon Slime!
Traveler: How about... a slime mask?
