Traveler: Adventure Challenge

Traveler: Duel

## Talk

Lan: I see that you're really good at cards...

## Talk

Lan: It's naive of you to try to beat me with this trick.

## Talk

Lan: I seem to have made a critical mistake...

## Talk

Lan: Card skills are like martial arts. In that case you ought to practice more.

## Talk

Lan: Oh, you're here. I can see you've been on quite a few adventures recently.
Lan: As it happens, I do have some matters that require an experienced adventuring hand to resolve.
Lan: If you're interested, go look for Tiantian. I've delegated the task of distributing commissions to her.
Traveler: What about you?
Lan: Me? Nothing's come up that interests me so far, and at a time like this... the Adventurers' Guild needs someone to hold the fort.
Lan: Alright, then. If you'd like to take this task on, go look for Tiantian. She needs to grow up sometime, anyway...

## Talk

Lan: Ah, it's you. Well, are you here to brave The Chasm by any chance?
Traveler: The Chasm?
Paimon: Paimon's never heard of any commission like that...
Lan: Oh, uh, you don't know about the Guild's commissions yet? Sorry, that's my mistake.
Lan: Well, The Chasm has been closed for a long time now. No one can go in without the Qixing's say-so, not even the Adventurers' Guild.
Traveler: No special pass for you guys?
Lan: Well, we wouldn't dream of being a bother to the people at Yujing Terrace. It would be a counterproductive thing to do, messing with pre-established policy like that.
Lan: Even Ms. Ganyu, who seems like the most amicable of the bunch, would probably just smile at us and say "why don't you have some tea while you wait here?"
Lan: And then she'll leave you hanging for most of the day, until you start wondering whether she'd forgotten all about you till she was nearly off from work...
Lan: Hmph, and as we all know, Ms. Ganyu never gets off work.
Paimon: Whoa...
Traveler: That certainly does sound like a very Ganyu-esque way of refusing.
Lan: Either way, this means that Ms. Katheryne isn't going to be giving out any commissions about The Chasm anytime soon. Instead, we've got to find more... convenient people to help us out in private.
Traveler: Convenient?
Lan: Yes, like for example, miners from Huishan Hall, members of the Millelith, staff at the Ministry of Civil Affairs. They can get passes to go in more easily, and...
Paimon: And... what?
Lan: Well... So what I'm saying is, O valiant hero who saved Liyue from the sea monster, yet seems to have nothing to do all day every day, surely you can talk to the Millelith on our behalf?
Traveler: No idea who you're talking about.
Lan: I'm talking about you.
Paimon: C'mon, she was definitely talking about you!
Lan: Don't play dumb. Who do you think I'm talking about, Rex Lapis?
Traveler: Hehe.
Lan: Alright, quit your bragging.
Lan: Whatever the case... You have our thanks for your help so far, and we'd like you to consider helping us again.
Lan: It's fine if the timing isn't convenient for you. It's just that... If you do end up passing through The Chasm, please help me look for a fellow named Muning.
Paimon: Muning... Who's that supposed to be?
Lan: He's a specialist sent to The Chasm by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. We've got some personal matters that need settling. You can ask him about it if you meet him there.
Lan: Just pass this message along: "You still owe Lan money for drinks. Don't you forget that." He'll get the picture.
Traveler: Got it.
Lan: Wait, hold on a moment! There's one more thing. If you take this commission up, just negotiate your payment directly with Muning.
Lan: Don't ask me why the arrangement is like this... We did this at the Ministry's insistence. Best not to question their decisions and all...
Traveler: I'll keep an eye out on the way in.
Traveler: I'll have you know that I do some important work, you know.
Traveler: They don't close one eye with you lot?

## Talk

Lan: Ugh, these commissions again?
Traveler: What's wrong?
Lan: Oh, it's you... I was just looking through the various commissions that have come in to the Guild.
Lan: But honestly, they're getting more mundane by the day.
Lan: Ever since the Qixing have taken control of Liyue Harbor, the scope of the Millelith's duties has been expanding slowly.
Lan: Lately, people seem to prefer approaching the Millelith to help out with tougher commissions, as opposed to asking us.
Lan: The commissions we've got now are all things like looking for lost animals, transporting cargo, delivering letters— you know, the like.
Lan: Like this one over here...
Lan: "Our Ash's gotten lost out in the wild. It's a *gray cat* with the following features..."
Lan: Commissions such as these take time and effort, but they're... Never mind.
Lan: I'm not one to be overly involved in day to day administration of the Guild, but I can't just let us be swamped by these commissions.
Lan: In order to get people to trust in our ability and assign us more important work...
Lan: ...I believe that we must hammer out some commissions of greater difficulty.
Lan: There was a commission that came in not long ago from someone who wanted us to deal with a wandering Stonehide Lawachurl.
Lan: It's been shelved for the moment due to a lack of candidates who can take that creature down, but if you're up for it, why don't you help us settle this matter?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Lan: Great. We're counting on you, then — I'll remain here and continue selecting commissions.
Lan: If we had more adventurers as capable as you around, we wouldn't have this problem...
Traveler: Do you have any other commissions?
Lan: I do, but those are all a bunch of trivial, menial tasks, all of which I still have to sort through. We'll just have to leave the Stonehide Lawachurl to you.
Lan: If we had more adventurers as capable as you around, we wouldn't have this problem...

## Talk

Lan: *sigh* Seems like nobody can get to the bottom of it...
Traveler: The bottom of what?
Lan: The clue! ...Hmm, perhaps "rumor" is a better word... a rumor about treasure.
Lan: There's an adventurer who said that he found a clue to treasure in the vicinity of Tianqiu Valley... But he tried everything, and simply could not locate the treasure.
Lan: In the end, he gave up looking and reported it to the Guild instead, and now the Guild is offering a reward for anyone able to solve this mysterious so-called "clue."
Lan: Any adventurer who wants to give it a go can follow the clue and see where it takes them. If they solve the riddle and find the treasure, the Guild will offer a reward.
Lan: But so far, nobody has found even a trace of the treasure...
Traveler: Can I try?
Lan: Oh, well, if you think you're up to it.
Lan: If you really are interested, there's no harm in giving it a go.
Lan: I'll mark the location mentioned in the clue on the map for you, then you can go take a look.
Traveler: And if I find it...?
Lan: Well, like it says in the adventurer's code, finders keepers!
Lan: All the Guild wants out of it is experience in solving riddles like this. That is the most important thing for adventurers.

## Talk

Traveler: ...You're amazing.
Lan: You think so? Well, I don't do it for any kind of praise or approval.
Lan: But since I am branch master and all that, I guess I have to show I'm making an effort or something.
Lan: I jotted down some thoughts on adventuring back when I was looking for the sword. Here, take them. Maybe you'll find them useful.

## Talk

Lan: ...? Excuse me, adventurer. Please see Katheryne about anything Guild-related — I am not intimately acquainted with the workings of the Guild.

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Lan: If you're looking for the Master of the Liyue Adventurers' Guild, I regret to inform you that, that would be me.
Lan: By which I mean, don't expect any help from me on Guild-related matters. I avoid involving myself in such bothersome affairs.
Lan: That is, unless you bring news about the sword.
Traveler: What sword?
Lan: My older brother's sword. If I find it, I can finally give him a proper burial...
Lan: It's the only fitting way to go for a martial artist like him.
Lan: It's a flat blade, sharp enough to slice an airborne hair in two. It's named "Unseen Razor."
Traveler: How did you become Master of the Liyue branch?
Lan: Ugh, why does everyone ask me the same question... I will make an exception for you, though, and give you the full story.
Lan: I used to be a mercenary. I joined the Adventurers' Guild so I could take advantage of their superior intelligence network and track down the sword.
Lan: I may not be very literate but I can read the word "sword." So I just took on every single commission that had something to do with a sword.
Lan: Then, just when I'd finished my eighth— Or was it my ninth commission? Anyway, I'd just finished it, and then word came from the headquarters in Snezhnaya that I'd apparently completed two S-rank commissions.
Lan: ...And suddenly I found myself promoted to branch Guild Master. It was all very strange indeed.
Traveler: I'll let you know if I find anything.
Lan: Oh, thanks! I love meeting people like you who are up for everything.
Lan: I am grateful to you, newcomer. It looks like it was worth me joining the Guild after all.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Lan: Aight, don't drag this out.

## Talk

Lan: It's been a while since I saw you last. For any Guild-related matters, please talk to Katheryne.

## Talk

Traveler: Have we met?
Lan: Huh? Don't tell me you've forgotten who I am? Luckily, I still remember you.
Lan: I'm the Master of the Liyue Adventurers' Guild, although I tend to avoid involving myself in Guild-related matters and other such bothersome affairs.
Lan: All that interests me is news about the sword.

## Talk

Traveler: The sword? What sword?
Lan: My older brother's sword. If I find it, I can finally give him a proper burial...
Lan: It's the only fitting way to go for a martial artist like him.
Lan: It's a flat blade, sharp enough to slice an airborne hair in two. It's named "Unseen Razor."

## Talk

Traveler: So, have you seen someone who looks like me?
Lan: Like you? ...Oh, I see. You're looking for family.
Lan: I haven't, no, but I will keep it in mind.
Lan: I've been separated from family before. I know how you feel...
