Traveler: About Stormterror...
Glory: I obviously couldn't see what happened in Mondstadt when Stormterror attacked, so I only know what other people have told me.
Glory: People's voices were full of fear during that time, but recently the sounds of anguish have finally died down.
Glory: Mondstadt's wind, too, has finally calmed down again.
