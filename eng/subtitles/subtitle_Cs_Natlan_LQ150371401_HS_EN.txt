Run, Skirk. Run!
-Please, Skirk... Save me... -Remember, leave no one alive
Heed my words, Skirk
Let fear take root in your soul
Why did you survive?
Why was it only you?
Skirk
Did you become a positive light in this world?
Hey!
This doesn't have to be the end
"Life is a gift. Don't let darkness claim it"
