Yumemizuki Mizuki: Oh, no... Someone's unconscious!
Rie: Uh... Ugh...
Traveler: Is it the Nightmare!?
Ei: It seems different in some respects... Step back and allow me to examine her.
Rie: Ugh... Ah!
Traveler: ...She's awake?
Rie: What's going on... Ah! A—Almighty Shogun!
Ei: What happened just now? What frightened you?
Rie: Sh—Shogun... I... I...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: It's alright. With the Shogun here, nothing can hurt you. Just take a deep breath and tell us what happened.
Rie: Phew... I almost fainted again just now...
Traveler: Is that what happened earlier? You fainted?
Rie: Yes... I was on my way to Uyuu Restaurant, and as I was crossing the bridge, I saw someone staring at me from behind a tree!
Rie: It was hard to make out their appearance in the dark, but I had a bad feeling... So, I tried to get a closer look in the moonlight...
Rie: And, it was... It was me!
Rie: In that moment, I thought about how people who see their doppelganger usually end up dead, and I fainted from the shock... I don't remember anything after that...
Yae Miko: A doppelganger? In Inazuma City? But, we only detected traces of the Nightmare around Mt. Yougou...
Rie: I heard that people encountered doppelgangers on Mt. Yougou, too! C—Could it be the work of some terrible youkai?
Traveler: Don't worry about that...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Now that we have an understanding of the situation, why don't I take you to the Police Station to file a report?
Rie: O—Okay...
Yae Miko: ...The situation is getting worse. If the doppelganger is limited to the festival grounds, that's one thing... But, appearing on a random street in Inazuma City...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Hm... On the bright side, the victim seems okay this time...
Haruto: B—Bad news, Shogun!
Ei: Hm? A Tenryou Commission official... What's wrong?
Haruto: A—Another victim... at the... the festival... Kappa... Kappa is... trapped in a nightmare!
Yumemizuki Mizuki: What!?
Yae Miko: But... Sara and the others were keeping watch!
Ei: Make haste! Back to Mt. Yougou at once!
Traveler: The strongest youkai in Inazuma are all right here.
