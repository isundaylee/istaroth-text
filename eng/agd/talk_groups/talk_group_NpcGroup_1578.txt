Traveler: Define "delicacy"?
Troubled Lianne: For me, a true delicacy has to be something that's made using only the very freshest ingredients.
Troubled Lianne: In fairness, most chefs in Mondstadt do use fresh produce from Springvale...
Troubled Lianne: But I still feel safer when I've gone out and collected my ingredients myself.
