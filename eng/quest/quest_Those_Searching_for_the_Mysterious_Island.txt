# Those Searching for the Mysterious Island


## Talk 1

Karya: Gâ€”Get back!
Paimon: Don't panic, just hang in there!
Karya: Ah, finally, someone's coming... Please, help us!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Wow, what an amazing view! And we can even see some Koholasaurs here and there! Hey, why don't we try to get a picture with one or two of them in the wild?
Traveler: But what if they try to bite us?
Paimon: Well... they're so cute, they probably won't do that, right...?
Paimon: Huh? What's happening over there?
Karya: Help! Somebody help us!
Paimon: Ah! Wild Koholasaurs are actually biting people!
Traveler: It's time for us to save the day again!
Paimon: #Yeah, those two are in trouble! The legendary {NICKNAME} and {M#his}{F#her} trusty sidekick Paimon will not stand by idly!
Traveler: Seems those pictures we wanted will have to wait.
Paimon: Yeah, we can save those for later! We can't just stand around when someone's calling for help!
