Traveler: What do you sell here?
Yamashiro Kenta: See, I'm from Watatsumi Island, and I opened this stall here in Ritou with my trademark being these round and radiant Watatsumi Pearls. Perfect for gifts or for wearing in your hair.
Yamashiro Kenta: Some of my fishermen friends from Watatsumi Island also send unagi here to be sold. I'm from a fishing family myself, so it goes without saying that I'll lend some neighbors a hand, you know what I mean?
Yamashiro Kenta: Our unagi is well-priced, and it's a mighty rare sight here in Ritou, so it's sold pretty well, haha! Small profits and quick turnover, that's how you stay in business a long time.
Yamashiro Kenta: Oh, right. I've also brought some old relics that some of my ancestors fished out of the sea some time back. If you're a customer of finer tastes, you can have a look at those.
