# Hu Tao Voicelines

## Hello
Yoh, now why might you be looking for me, hm? Oh, you didn't know? I'm the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, Hu Tao. Though by the looks of you... Radiant glow, healthy posture... Yes, you're definitely here for something other than that which falls within my regular line of work, aren't you?

## Chat: Wangsheng Funeral Parlor
Wanna come over for tea?

## Chat: Customers
One client, two clients, three clients!

## Chat: Taking a Break
When the sun's out, bathe in sunlight. But when the moon's out, bathe in moonlight~

## When It Rains
*sigh* What a bummer...

## When Thunder Strikes
Lightning! Let's bolt!

## When It Snows
Snow!

## When It's Windy
Ahhhh~ What a nice breeze~

## When the Wind Is Blowing
My hat's gonna get blown away!

## Good Morning
Well are those who rise in the early morn, while those late to bed I shall forewarn~

## Good Afternoon
Yo! Afternoon! Had lunch?

## Good Evening
Hee-hee, moon's out, and so am I!

## Good Night
Oh, you sleepy? Get some rest, I'm gonna take a walk by myself...

## About Hu Tao: Name
Hu as in "Who put me in this coffin?" and Tao as in "I can't geT OUt!" Hehe... No, not funny?

## About Hu Tao: Favorite Tricks
Lemme show you some fire tricks. First... Fire! And then... Whoosh! Fire butterfly! Be free!

## About Us: Curiosity
You've been all over, so you must've seen a lot. When you've got the time, tell me your story, yea?

## About Us: Night
Run around all you like during the day, but you should be careful during the night. When I'm not around, best keep your wits about you.

## About Us: Helper
Need a hand, need a hand? I'm here! If you need some assistance, I'm here to give it my all to the very end!

## About Us: Battle
Fighting's a pain. For me, it's not an objective so much as a means to an end. Using the means to reach the end, to fight for that which I will not compromise on — it's in this way that you and I are the same.

## About the Vision
Vision... Vision...? Oh, this thing? Yeah, whatever...

## Something to Share
We are entrusted by the people to loyally see out their wishes. Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is special, in that it carries a dual responsibility, to those both of this realm, and the next.

## Interesting Things
Some plants only grow in gloomier spots with ample moonlight. You ever seen any? Oh, no? Well, I'll have to show you next time.

## About Zhongli
Zhongli looks young, but his personality is a bit dusty. Knows everything, but doesn't fret over anything. Hmm... Couldn't be that he's a...
Hehe, forget it, whatever.

## About Qiqi
Have you seen Qiqi? Tell me where she is, quickly. I need to go seal her away, hee-hee!

## About Baizhu
Baizhu? Ugh, that guy...

## About Ningguang
Tianquan Ningguang... Well-off, a radiant gaze, exquisite face, in the know and capable of anything!

## About Beidou
Beidou is well-known in Liyue. She doesn't know me, but that's cool, me just knowing about her is enough. Aw man... I really do wanna make friends with her.

## About Xingqiu
I hear master Xingqiu is writing a book? Standard novella, or a ghost story? I think I should go tell him about all the things I run into — that'd make for a really good read!

## About Chongyun
All yang and no yin? Huh, who knew such people existed in this world?

## About Xiao
What would I know of the adepti? Ai-yai-yai, that kind of stuff is top-secret! Don't come asking me about it!

## About Keqing
The Yuheng, Keqing... she's quite hard to talk to. She's so uptight, hehe... Really makes me wanna mess with her. She wouldn't knock me in the head with her sword though, right? Or would she...?

## About Xiangling
Xiangling's a riot! Only a little "boo" and she jumps, she's so easy to scare! Being in the industry that I am, I just love these kinds of people the most. Gotta keep it in check though, in case Guoba ends up toasting me instead.

## About Yun Jin
Yun Jin always appears so graceful on formal occasions, but you'd be surprised how friendly she is in private! I made a bet with her once, and the loser had to sing lyrics of the winner's choice in their own singing style. My my, I wish you could have heard her operatic version of the Hilitune!

## About Shenhe
She is quite the fascinating individual, completely different from anyone else I've encountered. Do you think if I started eating divine herbs and drinking the dew of the mountains every single day, I'd be able to look as pure and pristine as she does? Oh~!

## About Lan Yan
Lan Yan, you say? She's a lot stronger than she looks. She claims to only know a few of the Qimen arts, but she can get rid of dangerous things like fetor and illnesses! Aiya, there's only one problem... Removing all the bad stuff and making everyone all fit and strong isn't exactly good for the funeral business!

## More About Hu Tao: I
♪Silly-churl, billy-churl, silly-billy hilichurl. Frilly-churl, willy-churl, frilly-willy hilichurl♪ 
Ah, hehe...

## More About Hu Tao: II
Versemonger of the darkest alleys — that's me!

## More About Hu Tao: III
If you ask me, there's nothing hard or scary about working at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, it's just a pain is all. It's a shame — others see us going out to work at night and just don't understand — and that's what scares them. *sigh* You all just don't understand!

## More About Hu Tao: IV
I'm Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's 77th Funeral Director, my grandfather was the 75th. First thing I took over was funeral affairs. Haha, surprising huh? And just like that, it's already been a few years... Time really does go by so quickly.

## More About Hu Tao: V
Balance must be maintained, and yet destinies remain variable. Death has its own rules, and yet is still hard to predict. Remember — no matter where, no matter when, no matter what the reason — one should never poke fun at death. Only once you know and respect death can you truly understand the value of life.

## Hu Tao's Hobbies
A bright moon aloft amid the vast, clear skies... Moments like these are just perfect for writing poetry.

## Hu Tao's Troubles
*sigh* I gotta find something fun to do... Sitting around doing nothing is a fate worse than death.

## Favorite Food
♪La~la~la~ Steamed fish with a side of prawn dumplings~

## Least Favorite Food
Qingxin Slime Condensate... Bleugh... Surely this is Xiangling getting payback...

## Receiving a Gift: I
Splendid, splendid! Now, allow me to compose a poem in loving memory of this dish.

## Receiving a Gift: II
Sure you don't want my help? C'mon, it's a great deal: cook twice the amount in the same time!

## Receiving a Gift: III
Ugh, I declare this dish dead, rest in peace.

## Birthday
Tonight the stars are dazzling and the moon majestic, it must be a special day... But just what day could it be... Haha, I know, I know! It's your birthday! It really is a great day.

## Feelings About Ascension: Intro
O-ya? O-ya-ya-ya?

## Feelings About Ascension: Building Up
Yeah, this is good, thanks!

## Feelings About Ascension: Climax
I never imagined that I, Hu Tao, could ever be like this. Energy like a rushing torrent, a heart soaring like a gliding eagle! I feel great!

## Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion
If I reach my full physical potential, then the next test is of the heart. It's largely thanks to you that I've been able to step foot into this uncharted territory. It is here that heart and soul are as one like clouds. Death is a constant for all among the multitudes that sit beneath the heavens.
