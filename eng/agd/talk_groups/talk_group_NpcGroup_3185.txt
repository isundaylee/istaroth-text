Toranosuke: Mr. Xavier, do we need to keep filming?

Traveler: Are you guys still "filming"?
Xavier: #Ahh... If it isn't you, my gallant {F#heroine}{M#hero}!
Xavier: I'm discussing what to film next with this soldier over here.
Xavier: I want to document the legends of the tanuki and the kitsune. But as for our good soldier...
Toranosuke: Well, I recommend that you head into the city and capture the might of our samurai on film, Mr. Xavier.

Traveler: So, have you guys reached a conclusion?
Xavier: Hmm... I suppose we've reached a common understanding after ample discussion.
Xavier: And that is to... make a "film" that includes both elements.
Xavier: The story I have in my head is that of a samurai slaying monsters and demons in Inazuma in ages past!
Xavier: And of course, there shall also be the most quintessential elements of love and comedy...
Xavier: However, this is just a preliminary thought. I still have much material to gather.

## Talk 4

Miyuki: You cannot afford to delay any longer.
Miyuki: Almost everyone has been evacuated now. Is this not the perfect time to sort everything out?
Toranosuke: Mind your own business! Tatarasuna's safety and the smithing operations are our business. Don't you have shrine duties to attend to?
Toranosuke: Or are you trying to tell me that metalwork is under the authority of the Grand Narukami Shrine now?
Miyuki: Don't you lecture me! You really think I'd be here talking to you if I didn't have to be?
Miyuki: It's because you aren't doing your job! The Tatarigami's influence is now being felt even by the Sacred Sakura at the Grand Shrine!
Miyuki: That's the only reason Lady Miko sent me out here. To exorcise it.
Toranosuke: ...What? How is that possible? The Grand Narukami Shrine is nowhere near here...
Miyuki: You are far too dismissive of the Tatarigami's power.
Miyuki: "Praise be to the mighty Electro Archon, the Tatarigami core has proven useful. It can be used as an unlimited energy source. How convenient."
Miyuki: You think that's as far as the issue with the Tatarigami goes, do you?
Miyuki: A problem arises with Tatarasuna's Mikage Furnace... and as far as you're concerned, the most pressing issue is a temporary halt in production?
Toranosuke: Right! The fact we've had to halt production is damaging the war effort. This is the most critical issue of all.
Miyuki: ...Ugh, forget it. I'm only here to deal with the Thunder Sakura issue anyway.
Miyuki: You may not like what I have to say, but I urge you to be more vigilant in how you're handling this.
Miyuki: You brought in experts from Fontaine to work on the Mikage Furnace, yes?
Miyuki: Most of them have already left, but unless I am mistaken, one engineer has stayed behind for equipment maintenance. What's stopping you from approaching him?
Toranosuke: You must mean Xavier. He already approached me, and he and I had a conversation.
Toranosuke: But the one managing the maintenance of the Mikage Furnace is Sir Hanbei, and he isn't here. Beyond that, I don't have the authority to divulge any further information.
Miyuki: ...That Hanbei? Never mind, this isn't getting me anywhere. Since you place such a great emphasis on authority, then let me put this to you in those terms:
Miyuki: If this situation deteriorates any further, you can expect to be visited by someone with the authority to take this out of your hands.
Toranosuke: As much as I appreciate the unsolicited advice, you don't need to worry yourself about this. Once Sir Hanbei gets back, I'll report the situation to him.
Toranosuke: Until then, forgive me for abiding by the rules, but I can't tell you anything else.
