# Between Facades and Familiar Faces


## Talk 1

Xiangling: ...Ohh, so that's how it is! Thanks for the suggestions, Mr. Zhongli! I have them all noted down.
Xingqiu: I've long heard that your knowledge encompasses all things old and new, Mr. Zhongli, but I never knew that you were well-versed in the art of cooking, too.
Xingqiu: It is truly an honor to make your acquaintance.
Zhongli: No need for formalities. I, too, feel humbled to be in the company of such talented young people. There are many things I could learn from you.
Chongyun: Oh, y—you flatter us!
Chongyun: Um, if it's possible... May I trouble you to provide a few words of guidance for my practices in exorcism...
Zhongli: Exorcism? I can't say I'm an expert in the field, but if you don't mind, we could start by discussing...
Paimon: Whoa! There's so many people here!
Paimon: All we knew was that Hu Tao invited Zhongli over. Paimon never thought we'd be meeting so many old friends, hehe.
Paimon: Happy Lantern Rite, everyone!
Traveler: Happy Lantern Rite!
Zhongli: Likewise. Please, take a seat.
Xiangling: Happy Lantern Rite! Are you having fun?
Traveler: I'm learning a lot.
Xiangling: Me too. I've seen Xinyan perform before, but this is the first time I've watched something like this.
Xiangling: I heard that the audience loved it too, and she's been receiving quite a lot of performance invitations lately. She's more busy than ever, and Yun Jin's gonna help her.
Chongyun: Yep, and they asked us to pass on their season's greetings to everyone. They hope we'll have a wonderful gathering.
Xingqiu: The performance was spectacular indeed. However... it gave Xiangling a huge burst of inspiration, which in turn gave us a bit of a headache...
Chongyun: "Us"? Did Xiangling ask you to try out her dishes too?
Xingqiu: Ahaha! That, my friend, is beside the point. Watching you eat was enough for me, haha.
Xingqiu: (Come to think of it, I probably shouldn't have burdened Chongyun with eating my share too...)
Paimon: Hold on, Xiangling came up with a new recipe? *gasp* Let Paimon try!
Xiangling: See? Someone here knows how to encourage people! Thanks, Paimon!
Xiangling: Oh, and I have to thank Mr. Zhongli too. He gave me lots of useful pointers that really drove it home for me.
Paimon: Oh, so that's what you were talking about before we arrived!
Zhongli: Yes. Since we'll be dining together, the topic of our conversation naturally revolved around cooking.
Zhongli: Xiangling's ideas are truly unconventional. Her choices in both ingredients and spices are comparable to a melody dancing on the tongue.
Zhongli: My suggestions were nothing more than the icing on the cake.
Paimon: Ohh! The two of you always deliver!
Xiangling: Hehe... Now I'm getting embarrassed...
Xiangling: Anyway, I'll get everyone to have a taste after I've adjusted the recipe based on Mr. Zhongli's advice!
Chongyun: Hmm... That sounds like it might become a little safer to eat.
Xingqiu: How about I sample the dishes next time?
Paimon: Speaking of eating... Paimon feels like we're missing someone...
Paimon: Hu Tao was the one who invited us, but she's not here! And, oh, where's Guoba?
Xiangling: Oh, Guoba volunteered to help dad at the restaurant!
Xiangling: You know, lots of people come over to eat during Lantern Rite. Without Guoba helping out, I probably wouldn't have had the time to accept Hu Tao's invitation.
Xiangling: As for Hu Tao...
Zhongli: The director went to collect a guest. She asked me to stay here and host you for the time being.
Zhongli: Seems like it's almost time...
Paimon: Huh, Hu Tao went to fetch someone in person? Oh, that must mean they are super important!
Paimon: Could it be... Keqing? Ningguang? Or... Captain Beidou?
Zhongli: She didn't clarify. And, as her subordinate, I couldn't just pry into the details, could I?
Black Screen Text: Suddenly, the door to the restaurant bursts open as if struck by a hurricane...
Hu Tao: Ta-da! We're~here!
Hu Tao: We're not late to the party, right? Right?
Hu Tao: Good thing the Conqueror of Demons and I are both as swift as the wind. And whoosh! We made it just in time!
Paimon: !
Xiao: !
Traveler: !
Zhongli: ...
Zhongli: I see... so the important guest is the Conqueror of Demons. I've been looking forward to meeting you.
Zhongli: The director didn't mention anything when she invited us. What a pleasant surprise... Gathered here with us tonight are not only young and accomplished individuals, but also the protector of Liyue's peace, Adeptus Alatus.
Zhongli: To convene here with all of you is indeed a great honor.
Xiao: Uhhh...
Traveler: I've become musically cultured.

## Talk 2

Paimon: You're not allowed to leave Paimon here alone!
Paimon: To be honest... Paimon's worried about saying the wrong thing.

## Talk 3

Xiao: Let's depart. You go ahead.

## Talk 4

Xiao: Are you alright?
Traveler: I should be the one asking you that.
Xiao: ...
Xiao: I... it's hard to describe.
Traveler: Unfamiliar with gatherings like this?
Xiao: It's not that.
Xiao: There were those among the adepti who loved gatherings and idle chit chat. Sometimes, they would call up a few others for a drink. Even I got dragged along to their gatherings, many times.
Xiao: The adepti all have their specialties, making most of them proud and arrogant. Everything they say is straight from the heart... It never gets too complicated.
Xiao: But this time...
Traveler: I understand. It's all Zhongli's fault.
Xiao: That's not what I meant!
Xiao: Or perhaps I should say Zhong... Rex Lapis is really good at adapting to human life. You could say that he actually enjoys doing so.
Xiao: And that's something I might never be able to do.
Traveler: You don't have to be like them.
Xiao: Hmm... That does sound like something you would say.
Xiao: No matter. I know my circumstances.
Xiao: Whenever I think of the ordinary conversations I've had with you, it feels... strangely novel.
Traveler: Strange in a good way?
Xiao: Yes.
Xiao: The parlor director went out of her way with the invitation, so it was difficult to turn her down. I had made mental preparations before agreeing to come.
Xiao: She told me that all the guests today would be "acquainted with elemental power," and I knew that you would be here.
Xiao: But I didn't expect the other guests to be...
Traveler: No one would've guessed.
Xiao: General Kapisas always said that we should live in the present and enjoy every pleasant surprise. Perhaps that's what I should do with what I'm feeling now.
Xiao: ...But I think he meant designing clothes for those around him.
Xiao: The clothes were intricately designed, but inconvenient to wear. Brother Bosacius never tried to hide his distaste in front of him.
Xiao: Rex Lapis did like his designs and even collected quite a few. The outfit he wears now was also designed by General Kapisas himself.
Xiao: I never saw him wear this during the war. I didn't expect him to start wearing it later.
Xiangling: Oh, here you are!
Xiangling: Um, I'm not intruding, right...
Xiao: You're not. What is it?
Xiangling: Hu Tao saw that everyone's done eating and asked the staff to bring out the desserts.
Xiangling: Paimon got so anxious that you weren't back yet that she scarfed down her dessert without the usual slurping and munching.
Traveler: But not so anxious that she can't eat. Sounds like she'll be okay.
Xiangling: To be honest, I was kinda worried too.
Xiangling: You looked a little restless just now, and I thought you weren't used to the food here and was planning to head back to Wangshu Inn for something Yanxiao made.
Xiao: You're worrying too much.
Traveler: Xiao, don't pull any Lemniscatic Wind Cyclings on us.
Xiao: ...Why would I.
Xiao: Anyway, let's head back.
Xiangling: Please wait!
Xiangling: There's another reason why I came looking for you.
Xiangling: Here, take these. I brought them for you!
Xiao: ...Almond Tofu?
Xiangling: Yup!
Xiangling: Since the Masterful Chefs competition, you could say that Yanxiao and I are not only competitors, but good friends as well! I visit him at Wangshu Inn sometimes to discuss our cooking.
Xiangling: I heard him say that the esteemed guest on the roof loves nothing more than a good plate of Almond Tofu, so I learned a thing or two about the dish from him.
Xiangling: I'll be honest... Before Hu Tao invited everyone, she secretly came looking for me, told me about the guests she planned to invite, and asked me for some suggestions on what she should order.
Xiangling: So I made a few servings of Almond Tofu for you guys in advance! Take them as a token of gratitude for your support.
Xiangling: When I told Guoba that I was making these for you, he started eagerly running around the kitchen and helping a lot too!
Traveler: Thank you, Xiangling and Guoba!
Xiao: Thank you for the trouble, there was no need to...
Traveler: Ahem...
Xiao: ...I'll take them. Thank you... and Guoba too.
Xiangling: You're welcome!
Xiangling: Oh, the Almond Tofu I made probably tastes and feels a little different from the type Yanxiao cooks. Please let me know if there's any improvements I should make!
Xiao: Okay.
Xiangling: Hehe, that's all!
Xiangling: Alrighty, we should head back now. We can't keep Paimon waiting!
Traveler: You do you.
Traveler: I understand. It's all Venti's fault.
Xiao: N—No, I didn't mean that...
Xiao: So you know his true identity. I'll get straight to the point then.
Xiao: The Anemo Archon is a free spirit, and his temperament is as carefree as the music he plays on the flute. It's easy for a god like him to live in harmony with humans...

## Talk 5

Zhongli: It seems like our new friend is an expert in wine.
Venti: I deserve no such praise. I only drink for fun — it's nothing compared to your expertise.
Venti: I'm glad we're only having tea today. What if I got drunk and said something nonsensical? I'd surely become an object of ridicule to someone I've just met.
Zhongli: No such thing. I wouldn't dare disrespect the director's guest.

## Talk 6

Hu Tao: Did you talk about anything interesting before we started the meal? Anything fun I missed out on?
Xiangling: Oh, we were talking about cooking.
Xiangling: Mr. Zhongli told us that he went on a trip to Qiaoying Village the other day and got a hold of some uncommon ingredients — tea seed oil and sesame oil. He suggested I try using those in my new dishes.
Hu Tao: Ohhh... No wonder he left his post for so long that day.
Hu Tao: Those ingredients would be difficult for anyone else to find.
Hu Tao: I guess I'll need his help next time as well.

## Talk 7

Chongyun: About you and Venti...
Xingqiu: Um, haha...
Chongyun: Could he be... a partner in your family business?
Xingqiu: That's right.
Xingqiu: You know how my family is. A lot of business secrets can't just be divulged at the dinner table.
Chongyun: Ahh, just as I thought.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: Ugh, you're finally done whispering secrets to each other!?
Paimon: So much for promising Paimon you'll be back soon, hmph!
Traveler: We were pretty quick. You're only angry because you have no sense of time.
Paimon: H—How could you say that to Paimon!
Paimon: Hmph, in that case, besides "having no sense of time," Paimon will let you know what having no sense of fullness looks like!
Paimon: Your dessert is all Paimon's!
Xiao: Sorry to keep everyone waiting.
Hu Tao: No worries, we're all just chatting here. There's no serious business to take care of.
Hu Tao: Whether we're chatting outside or inside, it's all the same.
Traveler: Strive to be more like Hu Tao, Paimon.
Paimon: Hmph, Paimon's too busy eating to talk to you.
Hu Tao: But even though we're all well-acquainted by now, I think this festive gathering deserves something ceremonious.
Venti: Oh? Is this some local custom?
Hu Tao: Nope.
Hu Tao: This is something I made up so that good luck will be on our side, that's all!
Hu Tao: Spontaneity is the best choice to make here! Um, let's use this incense burner on the table.
Hu Tao: It's been lit for so long now that the incense is running out. I'll leave refilling and lighting the incense to the most distinguished guest among us all.
Hu Tao: Lighting the incense will signify continuous growth and prosperity in all our endeavors in the new year!
Venti: I see. Perfect symbolism, as expected of Hu Tao!
Venti: And speaking of the most distinguished guest here today... I'm sure we all agree that it's Mr. Zhongli.
Venti: I'm not very familiar with the details of his past deeds, but chatting with him has been a real eye-opener, even for a bard who has traveled all across the world.
Venti: If knowledge were a form of power, one could even say that you're a wielder of unlimited strength!
Zhongli: But when it comes to having a way with words, the notable bard is certainly one cut above the rest.
Zhongli: I just happen to have a good memory. It is such an unexceptional skill, yet you made it sound like an unparalleled talent. I am truly impressed.
Zhongli: Since we all get to nominate someone...
Venti: Mm-hmm.
Zhongli: I think it's only fair that we let the parlor director light the incense.
Hu Tao: Huh, that won't do! Don't flatter me just because I'm your boss!
Hu Tao: We are looking for the most distinguished guest here. As the host, I shouldn't be involved in this discussion at all!
Hu Tao: Now that we've enjoyed this tableful of delicacies, how about we let our one and only chef here do the honors?
Xiangling: Um, is this really the way this works? I didn't cook any of these dishes!
Hu Tao: It's not a big deal!
Hu Tao: Just look at her! Xiangling, the disciple of an adeptus, the Stove God's best companion, the winner of the Masterful Chefs competition.
Hu Tao: The only heir of the famous Wanmin Restaurant, a good old friend of mine. There's no better choice!
Paimon: Uhh, why does Paimon feel like we're back at square one again?
Xiangling: P—Please, stop! You're making me embarrassed!
Xiangling: If we're looking for a distinguished guest... surely the second son of the Feiyun Commerce Guild counts? It's one of the largest commerce guilds in Liyue Harbor!
Xingqiu: Eh, don't get me involved in this!
Hu Tao: Oooh, not a bad choice. With the commerce guild's young master lighting the incense, we're all sure to make a huge sum of Mora in the new year.
Xingqiu: That's not how it works!
Xingqiu: Making a fortune is indeed a fine wish, but it's of lesser importance than good health and happiness.
Xingqiu: Which means we should choose Chongyun, the skilled exorcist who keeps everyone's home safe from evil spirits.
Chongyun: Huh? Now you're nominating me?
Chongyun: I can't be the one when we have the Conqueror of Demons right here!
Chongyun: Adeptus Xiao has the most seniority among everyone here today. We should...
Xiao: I refuse.
Xiao: I am most certainly not the most distinguished guest here.
Traveler: (Is he going to say it's Zhongli...)
Xiao: You should all be able to make the right judgment based on your observations.
Traveler: (Wait, don't...)
Xiao: One person here is well-acquainted with everyone else.
Traveler: (...Hm?)
Paimon: Oh, that's right!
Paimon: Even though you're always mocking Paimon, you're still pretty popular with other people!
Paimon: No, wait! Paimon said she wouldn't talk to you again...
Traveler: I'm not the only well-connected person here though.
Paimon: Huh? Who else is there?
Traveler: You, of course.
Paimon: Huh... Huh!?
Paimon: Does that mean... Paimon's the most distinguished guest?
Paimon: Well, that was unexpected, ehehe...
Venti: I agree. Paimon's just the one we need.
Venti: Without a friend constantly by your side, a long journey would become dreadfully lonesome.
Venti: But once you have someone there to brighten up the atmosphere, everything along the way will become lively and vibrant too.
Zhongli: Ah...
Zhongli: #{NICKNAME} has traversed many nations and left behind a great deal of fascinating stories. But without Paimon, they would've become quite monotonous.
Zhongli: Paimon plays an indispensable role in making your journey a happy and smooth one.
Paimon: You guys, Paimon's not used to being praised like that...
Paimon: Uh, those were genuine compliments, right?
Traveler: Of course. You're the best travel companion ever!
Paimon: Thank you!
Paimon: You made Paimon wait for a long time, but Paimon's not mad anymore!
Xingqiu: Don't take everything to heart, Paimon. Friends tease each other all the time.
Chongyun: Hmm... That is indeed true.
Xiangling: #That means Paimon is as important to {NICKNAME} as Guoba is to me!
Hu Tao: Looks like we've come to an agreement! Any objections before we proceed?
Xiao: #I trust {NICKNAME}'s judgment.
Hu Tao: Then Paimon it is!
Hu Tao: And now, the world's most excellent traveler's greatest companion, guide, and friend — Paimon! — will be refilling and lighting the incense for us!
Hu Tao: Here you go, take the match... and don't burn yourself! But if things go really wrong, here's a two for one coupon.
Black Screen Text: Amidst everyone's laughter and applause, Paimon clumsily lights the incense...
Black Screen Text: You all have a relaxed heart-to-heart chat all the way until nightfall.
Black Screen Text: Now that everyone's had their fill of delicious food and tea, it's time to say goodbye.
Traveler: Take a look in the mirror.

### Additional Talk 2

Hu Tao: It's getting late. I won't take up any more of your time. You're all free to go as you please.
Traveler: The food and desserts were delicious.
Paimon: Yep! The tea was amazing, too!
Hu Tao: You don't have to go all polite on me. Just remember to come when I invite you next time!
Hu Tao: Hmm... Let's see...
Hu Tao: It's dark out, so I'm going to accompany Xiangling, Xingqiu, and Chongyun back home. As for the rest of the guests, I'll leave them to our consultant.
Venti: No need. I'm headed towards the harbor to meet a friend on the ship. There's no need to trouble one such as Mr. Zhongli.
Venti: I think you know the place I'm talking about. Come meet me anytime!
Traveler: I will.
Venti: It was great getting to know you all. Let's meet again when the spring breeze begins to blow!
Hu Tao: Bye! We should write poetry together sometime!
Hu Tao: We'll catch you all later then.
Hu Tao: Don't forget to return to the parlor later. There's something I need you to do!
Zhongli: Understood. See you later.
Traveler: Bye!
Zhongli: Well then...
Xiao: Rex Lapis...
Zhongli: Just Zhongli will do.
Zhongli: I live as a mortal in Liyue Harbor now. I am just one among many who begin work at sunrise, and retire to rest at sundown.
Zhongli: If we were to consider status and seniority, as Zhongli, I should be respectfully referring to you as Adeptus Xiao.
Xiao: Heaven forbid!
Traveler: Adeptus Xiao!
Xiao: ...Not you too!
Zhongli: Haha, I meant what I said.
Zhongli: I heard that during the Lantern Rite music festival, you conferred with Streetward Rambler and Cloud Retainer. I take it as you've gained a lot more knowledge about the past?
Zhongli: The same truth will sound different coming from different people. As more bear witness to a story, feelings and interpretations expand in variety too.
Zhongli: I once had a pleasant chat about the past and present with a Sumeru scholar named Soraya, and learned a few things about her research topic.
Zhongli: From the evidence she found and the conclusions she made, her area of research is already very close to the truth.
Zhongli: But there are multiple sides to humans and gods alike.
Zhongli: In the legends recorded by humans, some gods were depicted as arrogant and condescending, while others were kind and capable.
Zhongli: But whether to me, Streetward Rambler, Cloud Retainer, or younger adepti such as Xiao and Ganyu, those adepti and gods that may seem extraordinary to humans are something more akin to close companions.
Zhongli: This was as true back then as it is right now.
Zhongli: #Just as Xiao may seem unapproachable to most, but {NICKNAME} has proved otherwise.
Zhongli: So there's no need to dwell too much on certain things.
Xiao: Rex La— I mean, Zhongli, what you're saying is...
Zhongli: It looks like you understood what I meant.
Zhongli: Ah...
Zhongli: The director asked me to accompany you on your return, but I don't think you'll need my protection. I'll be taking a walk around and admiring the night scenery.
Zhongli: After that... it'll be time for me to go back and meet up with the director. Goodbye for now.
Paimon: Bye, Zhongli!
Paimon: Everyone's gone now...
Paimon: Paimon always feels a little empty inside when a lively celebration ends...
Paimon: But at least you'll always stay by Paimon's side!
Paimon: #No no no, Paimon got it mixed up! Paimon, the best and most distinguished travel guide, will always stay by your side, {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: It's my honor.
Paimon: Hmph, good that you're aware of that!
Paimon: Xiao, is there anything else you wanna do? We could take you on a tour of Liyue Harbor!
Xiao: No need.
Xiao: I've stayed here for much longer than I had expected. The city lights are a fine sight... but it's time for me to leave.
Xiao: The events of today occurred so abruptly. I appreciate your kindness.
Traveler: The feeling's mutual. You don't have to thank me every time.
Xiao: Okay.
Xiao: I'll... see you next time, then.
Traveler: I'm afraid there'll be a lot to ask of you in the future too, most distinguished Paimon.
Traveler: Let's stop teasing him now.
Traveler: Thanks for the treat, Director.
