Traveler: Who are these formidable opponents?
Feresht: One is that sly Sulaykha. With that silver tongue of hers, she's able to sell something as cheap as a rug at a high price. I'm not gonna lose to her!
Feresht: The other is that Lord Sangemah Bay often mentioned by Father.
Feresht: I don't know who that is yet, but Father makes it sound like they're someone even more impressive!
Feresht: It doesn't matter. A powerful adversary is all the more worth the challenge. Just wait and see!
