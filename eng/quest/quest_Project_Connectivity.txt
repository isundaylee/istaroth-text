# Project Connectivity

Daya: Hello there! I'm Daya from Kshahrewar. Are you here to take part in the Wisdom Gala too?
Daya: This is the new game that our Darshan has put forth: "Project Connectivity"!
Daya: Would you like to have a go at it?
Traveler: If I recall, Kshahrewar's specialty is...
Daya: We study mechanics and architecture, yes.
Daya: Uh, seems like I've gone off-topic. So, to take part in this Gala, many of our students put their heads together...
Daya: ...And the result was "Project Connectivity!"
Daya: Basically, players will need to use the various objects that we have prepared to... well, create a pathway.
Daya: Laying down bridges, setting up stairs... The eventual goal is to create a path for people to travel on that can reach its destination.
Daya: Once you have finished constructing that road, we will conduct a final verification, just like how we would test completed buildings.
Daya: Essentially, you just need to set up a safe road to attain success.
Traveler: That sounds rather complicated...
Daya: Don't worry, don't worry! You're not being asked to construct anything in real life.
Daya: If something goes wrong and the road collapses, we'll just have to rebuild it. We're not putting limits on the number of tries you have either.
Daya: Just let your imagination run free and build as beautiful as a road can be!
Traveler: I'll give it a go.
Daya: Alright. In that case, if you'll look over this way...
Traveler: Sorry, I'm a little busy right now.
Daya: Ah, is that so... It's alright. Our booth will be open for the entire duration of the Gala.
Daya: Whenever you feel like having a go, you can just come to me.
Traveler: I haven't much of a knack for architecture.
