# Neko Is a Cat: Shrine Recipe


## Talk 1

Taisuke: Miss Etsuko, where should we go next?
Etsuko: Phew... I think we'll rest for a while...
Etsuko: Hmm? It's you. Is there anything we can do for you?
Traveler: We need to find a reliable chef...
Taisuke: You're looking for a chef? On Seirai Island?
Paimon: Well, here's the thing. Neko would like us to...
Taisuke: Huh. So Lady Neko wants you to prepare some food, is that right?
Taisuke: Ah, darn it! If only I had some skill in cooking...
Etsuko: In other words, you'd like a chef who can help you figure out "how to make something a cat would like out of these ingredients," right?
Etsuko: Let me think... A chef... A chef...
Etsuko: Well, why don't you try going to Inazuma City and looking for Kiminami Anna at Kiminami Restaurant?
Etsuko: She's a very nice person, and she's good at cooking as well. She should be able to help you out.
Traveler: Thanks, we'll go look for her.
Etsuko: No need to thank us. Off you go, then, Taisuke and I still need to lay some plans for future exploration.
Etsuko: Hehe, well, I hope that this shrine really does thrive.
Etsuko: Otherwise, the hard work that you and Neko put into fixing it might go to waste...

## Talk 2

Kiminami Anna: Hello, welcome to Kiminami Restaurant. Would you like something?
Traveler: So I need to make Neko a meal...
Kiminami Anna: "Neko?" ... Might that be a cat's name, by any chance?
Paimon: You know who Neko is?
Kiminami Anna: No. I just thought that it was a fitting name for a cat.
Traveler: That's some strong intuition you've got there...
Paimon: Never mind that for now. This is how it happened...
Kiminami Anna: There's... an Asase Shrine on Seirai Island, and that shrine is home to a talking cat!? And that cat asked you to make it a meal?
Kiminami Anna: Is... Is that really true? I've never heard of such a thing!
Traveler: Surely as I live and breathe...
Kiminami Anna: Seirai Island, was it? I'll go there for sure if I get the chance!
Traveler: Uh, so, about Neko's meal...
Kiminami Anna: Ah, right... I nearly forgot about that. Let me think...
Kiminami Anna: Hmm, a dish that a cat would enjoy, huh...
Paimon: Is it gonna be difficult?
Kiminami Anna: ...
Traveler: It's going to be difficult, isn't it?
Kiminami Anna: This is a challenge to the Kiminami family name! I'm going to overcome it, no matter what!
Kiminami Anna: Now then. I believe that Fish, Raw Meat, Seagrass, and Rice will make for a dish that even cats will fall over themselves to get a taste of. Leave it to me, Traveler!
Paimon: P—Paimon wants some too...
Traveler: Actually, me too...
Kiminami Anna: No problem!
Kiminami Anna: Let me consider how I'm going to structure this recipe. In the meantime, help me prepare three servings of Seagrass.
Traveler: You got it.
Kiminami Anna: It'll be in your hands then. Just three servings will do. Once you find them, come back and give them to me.
Traveler: Have you figured it out already?
Kiminami Anna: I have some thoughts, but they haven't completely taken shape yet...
Kiminami Anna: Just help me get those three servings of Seagrass first. Thank you very much.
Traveler: We'll leave it in your hands, then.
Traveler: You can go have a look yourself.

## Talk 3

Kiminami Anna: How is it? Have you found the three servings of Seagrass yet?

## Talk 4

Neko: This smell... You've done it, then?
Traveler: That we have.
Neko: Meow, meow! Wonderful! Allow me to have a taste.
Neko: ...
Neko: Mmm, it's somewhat different from how Hibiki used to make it...
Paimon: I—It should be pretty good. C'mon, let's have a go at it!
Paimon: Ooh, this is great!
Neko: ...Meow.
Paimon: (Is Neko unhappy that it tastes different from how this Hibiki person used to make it?)
Neko: It's very good. You are most reliable indeed.
Traveler: Glad you enjoyed it.
Neko: It is quite different from how Hibiki used to make it, yes.
Neko: But when I ate it, the feeling it gave me was the same as the feeling of eating together with Hibiki.
Neko: Why is this so, human? Are you humans capable of some strange magic?
Traveler: It's just been a while since someone made you food.
Neko: ...Still, you have my thanks. Long years it has been since I last tasted something this good.
Neko: The little ones will love it as well. Could you please bring this meal to them as well?
Neko: Since I enjoy it, they should too. Perhaps they will be more obedient after eating such a wonderful meal...
Traveler: It's probably the passion of the person who made it.

## Talk 5

Neko: Ah, you're here. Great timing. I have need of aid.
Traveler: What's the matter?
Neko: Thanks to you, the shrine has been greatly improved, and we can expect the humans to return very soon indeed.
Neko: I have been instructing the little ones to maintain a dignified bearing and not abase themselves before humans.
Neko: Unfortunately, they are too used to running wild and will not listen to instruction.
Neko: Nonetheless, I have a cunning plan.
Traveler: A cunning plan?
Neko: When I was still very, very young, I too enjoyed playing everywhere. In an effort to bring me in line along with the other cats, Hibiki would make a most delicious dish.
Paimon: D—Delicious, you say...!
Neko: Whenever that meal was served, the cats would come running in from trees and rooftops alike. No matter how hot it was, or how scalded our tongues got, we could not resist it.
Neko: Hibiki would make a huge pot of it every time, and humans and cats would partake together. Even those who visited the shrine would get a share.
Neko: Ah, but Domeki... Tsk, that glutton. He would always eat so very much. A more undignified sight I have never seen.
Traveler: So...
Neko: Very good, your comprehension is excellent. Yes, I am asking you to make a dish.
Traveler: Not to doubt your wisdom...
Paimon: But do you really know how this dish should be made?
Neko: Meow, meow?
Traveler: ...
Neko: I—Is not leaving such matters to you the very point of this exercise? Must I do everything myself?
Neko: ...Ah, but that dish was truly a thing of wonder! Even after wandering far off, or having spent years and years without it, I still remember its flavor...
Paimon: #Well, Traveler, looks like this is a job for us, eh? It's for the shrine's sake, after all!
Traveler: What's in that meal?
Neko: Of course I remember. Fish meat, animal meat, water-grown grass, and white rice.
Paimon: Ooh, so that's Fish, Raw Meat, Seagrass, and Rice, huh... How was it made, then?
Neko: I do not recall.
Traveler: ...Looks like we'll have to ask a chef.
Paimon: Sure, but... Where do we find a chef who knows how to make cat food? Hmm... Let's ask Taisuke and Etsuko. Maybe they'll know what to do.
Traveler: Let's go ask those two adventurers.
Paimon: Oh yeah, that's right! Taisuke and Etsuko are adventurers, so they might know something.
Traveler: You're so easily read, Paimon.
Paimon: Come on, Paimon's a friend to cats! Now, Neko, do you still remember the ingredients that went into that dish?
Traveler: You want me to make you some food?

## Talk 6

Neko: Have you brought the meal to those little ones?
Traveler: They absolutely loved it.
Neko: Is that so? Wonderful, wonderful. Meow, meow...
Neko: It has been too long since I ate something so wondrous.
Neko: Meow meow, meow... Though I now need neither food nor water, the taste of a meal with rice is always too great a temptation...
Neko: That little one was named Meshi, precisely because that is the best thing I could think of in all the world.
Traveler: So, what was the name of the dish that Hibiki would make?
Neko: A name? Dishes need names?
Traveler: This one's called the "Invigorating Kitty Meal," you know.
Neko: What a complicated name. Still, I do not hate it.
Neko: ...And you are right. Meals are good things, and all good things should have names.
Neko: Meow, meow, I will ask Hibiki when she returns. You can make her your dish then, too...
Neko: And she will make you hers. Then, you shall be able to eat two different yet delicious dishes.
Neko: Indeed, that is all the more reason for me to restore this shrine. When Hibiki returns, we shall all eat together.
Neko: Thank you. This is most delicious. Meow meow.

## Talk 7

Neko: I shall leave the cooking to you.
Neko: And when you are done, eat it together with us.

## Talk 8

Etsuko: Something the matter? If not, head over to the city and look for Miss Kiminami Anna.

## Talk 9

Taisuke: *sigh* If only I new how to make food...

## Talk 10

Kiminami Anna: Hello, welcome to Kiminami Restaurant. Would you like something?
Kiminami Anna: Hello— Oh, it's you! Miss Kamisato's friend! Come in, come in! What can I help you with?

## Talk 11

Kiminami Anna: Great! Give me a moment. I think... I think I know what to do now!
Kiminami Anna: It's done!
Paimon: Ooh, that smells awesome! Paimon really wants to try some...
Kiminami Anna: What shall we call this? Hmm... Since it's for a talking cat, let's call this the Invigorating Kitty Meal!
Kiminami Anna: Well then! Here's your dish to go.
Kiminami Anna: Ah, yes, and let me write the recipe down for you as well.
Paimon: #Woohoo! Guess Traveler-made Kitty Meals are on the menu in the near future!
Traveler: What are you, Paimon, a cat?
Paimon: Hey, that's rude! Good food is a universal language, don't you know?
Paimon: Anyway, thanks a bunch, Miss Kiminami!
Kiminami Anna: It's alright, don't worry! Just take this meal and the recipe as a present for Neko.
Kiminami Anna: I'll be sure to head down to that Asase Shrine to pay her a visit once I find the time.
Kiminami Anna: Alright, off you go now. Don't keep Neko waiting.
Traveler: Thank you.
