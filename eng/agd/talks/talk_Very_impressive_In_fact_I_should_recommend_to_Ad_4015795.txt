Charles: Very impressive. In fact, I should recommend to Adelinde that you be commissioned to play at the next such family event.
Charles: As for your invitation... To be honest, I was just about ready to agree the moment you finished your performance.
Charles: But I'm not sure if I'd want to ask Master Diluc for a day off over something this trivial — after all, he'd agree without hesitation.
Charles: How about this, then? I'll send you a token of support for your festival. Will that do?
Traveler: So you'll be sending us several crates of wine?
Charles: Haha, I doubt everyone who'll be attending the festival will be of drinking age.
Charles: As such, I'll give you some decorative banners instead. We've got them stocked in the winery warehouse — and I believe they'll come in quite handy.
Charles: Don't worry, you won't have to go fetch them yourselves. I'll have some of our traders deliver them directly.
Charles: Just consider it the "Angel's Share."
