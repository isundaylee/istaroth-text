# The Truth Is Also a Lie


## Talk 1

Paimon: What are you doing? Release Shinnojou this instant!
Kamisato Ayato: Stop this at once.
Kubo: It's the Yashiro Commissioner...
Kubo: Hmph! Well, we take orders from our Master, no one else.
Kamisato Ayato: Really... Then, please excuse me!

## Talk 2

Kubo: Blast! Let's go!
Kubo: We must report to Master right away!
Paimon: Hey! Get back here!
Kamisato Ayato: No need to follow them.
Kamisato Ayato: We need bait to catch the fish anyway. Leave them be.
Kamisato Ayato: I think I saw a key fall to the ground during the fight. Let's free Shinnojou first.
Kamisato Ayato: But... in all the chaos, it must have been kicked to one side. Hmm, where did it end up?
Paimon: What the...? It's a tanuki! ...Oh, don't tell Paimon that the tanuki took it!
Kamisato Ayato: Let's follow it and see.

## Talk 3

Shinnojou: Oh, thank the gods! You're here! Please, help me!

## Talk 4

Shinnojou: Thank you, thank you...
Shinnojou: It was terrifying... They said they were gonna throw the cage into the sea with me still inside...
Shinnojou: Oh... Wait, you have to listen to me! Lady Chisato's wedding, they... It's all part of a scheme! Someone's trying to use the wedding for their own ends!
Paimon: Calm down, Shinnojou. It's okay. We know about all that.
Shinnojou: ...Huh?
Kamisato Ayato: Our suspicions were roused to this possibility, and so far, everything is unfolding rather as we expected.
Kamisato Ayato: Those behind this plan are not going to give up easily. Their next move is imminent. We must devise sufficient countermeasures.
Shinnojou: Yashiro Commissioner, you're personally going to take action?
Kamisato Ayato: This situation has consequences for the whole Tri-Commission, and the stability of all of Inazuma is at stake. My hitherto-neutral stance ends now.
Kamisato Ayato: The Almighty Shogun has always despised these pathetic power games. As a Commissioner, I am a servant of the Shogun, and it is therefore my duty to handle these tiresome matters on her behalf.
Shinnojou: Hmm... That's true...
Kamisato Ayato: Shinnojou, don't return to your post yet. Find somewhere safe and stay hidden.
Kamisato Ayato: Traveler, Paimon. Let's get out of here.
Black Screen Text: A short while after leaving...
Matsuura: Well, if it isn't the Yashiro Commissioner.
Matsuura: I hear you showed up here with no explanation and attacked my men.
Matsuura: You wouldn't happen to be carrying out some sort of secret mission, now, would you?
Kamisato Ayato: I heard that someone was taking the law into their own hands. As a responsible official of Inazuma, I could not in good conscience stand idly by.
Kamisato Ayato: Shinnojou may be your retainer, but the law does not grant you the right to abuse him.
Matsuura: Abuse? Nonsense! I was just teaching him a lesson.
Matsuura: Out of nowhere, a low-ranking officer decides to barge in on Lady Hiiragi and start spurting out the most absurd and insulting nonsense one can imagine... A truly egregious loss of decorum!
Matsuura: I daresay, the poor Lady was terrified.
Kamisato Ayato: So you're saying that you know absolutely nothing of the reasons for his actions? Because otherwise, why would you describe it as "out of nowhere"?
Matsuura: Two people from two different clans are getting married, that's all there is to it, and yet this young gentleman took it upon himself to fabricate a nonsensical disaster story around it. How should I know what he was thinking?
Matsuura: Even if she marries into the Kujou Clan, Lady Hiiragi will always be the daughter of the Hiiragi Clan and the most distinguished member of the Kanjou Commission.
Matsuura: We are, and always will be, her loyal assistants. It's our duty to see that she never has to worry about anything.
Matsuura: Loyalty and duty are our guiding principles. Not only did this guard show no regard for either, he went out of his way to upset our Lady. How could one do such a thing?
Matsuura: Even if we put it down to a rare moment of impulsivity, I have to say I'm surprised to see one of such noble standing as yourself rushing to his defense.
Paimon: Darn it! This guy is good... Annoyingly good!
Traveler: (He's a slimeball.)
Kamisato Ayato: Funny, I'm suddenly reminded of an anecdote I'd like to share with you. There's not been a dull moment since I took up my post in the Yashiro Commission. Every day, I've been exposed to new and fascinating things.
Kamisato Ayato: For instance, a merchant from abroad once told me about a curious kind of bird with the most extraordinarily long tongue. So long, in fact, that you can tie two knots in the portion of it that extends out of its beak.
Kamisato Ayato: I'm sure someone as erudite as yourself should be able to guess what people do with these unusual avians?
Matsuura: Uh... keep them as pets?
Kamisato Ayato: Haha, you'd think, wouldn't you? But there's a catch. You see, this bird is of no use to humans whatsoever, and certainly doesn't make a suitable pet. If you catch one, the best thing you can do is actually cut its tongue off and throw it out of the window.
Kamisato Ayato: The reason they give is this: "The longest tongue has the most to say, but don't be deceived as it chirps away... lest the song it sings lead you astray."
Matsuura: You...! I say, Yashiro Commissioner, are you here simply to mock the Kanjou Commission?
Kamisato Ayato: Far from it. In my mind, the Kanjou Commission is made up of honorable individuals, upright and forthright, conscientious and loyal.
Kamisato Ayato: It is unbecoming of such people to resort to lies, deception, and filibustering all as part of a plan to remove Lady Hiiragi from her position in the Kanjou Commission.
Matsuura: Yashiro Commissioner, please don't make accusations without any evidence.
Kamisato Ayato: The evidence is standing right in front of me, is it not? I have a credible witness who can confirm you were quick to try and make him disappear as soon as he said something that you did not like.
Kamisato Ayato: Dear me, I can't believe the grand Matsuura Clan is now represented by someone with less of a sense of loyalty than even an ordinary servant.
Kamisato Ayato: You studied hard and took a government position, only to make it to where you are now just to play these petty power games behind the scenes... I'm not sure whether it's because you're smart enough to play the system, or too foolish to know any better?
Kamisato Ayato: In your years of service to the Shogun, not only have you managed to glean nothing good from the people around you, you have also let yourself be blinded by self-interest... And now you have ruined your once-bright future.
Kamisato Ayato: I'm not angry, Mr Matsuura... I just feel sorry for you.
Matsuura: ...Hahaha! Is that right? Then tell me, if you're so bright, what exactly do you think you can do to me!?
Matsuura: This is at most a Kanjou Commission issue. We'll handle this amongst ourselves.
Matsuura: You are reaching rather outside of your bounds, Yashiro Commissioner, if you seek to involve yourself in other clans' affairs... Might I be so bold, then, as to question your motives in doing so?
Matsuura: I think you are simply opposed to an alliance between the Kanjou Commission and Tenryou Commission, because the new balance of power in the Tri-Commission would be a threat to you personally.
Matsuura: So you come here with an elaborate excuse to try and break up this marriage!
Kamisato Ayato: Hm. So, that's how you view it. Well, I have to admit, you clearly are far more talented than I at monitoring the power balance within the Tri-Commission.
Matsuura: Let me be crystal clear. This wedding is going to happen, and nothing is going to change that.
Matsuura: The notices have already been sent out. All of Inazuma City knows about it now!
Matsuura: Most of the public weren't aware that Kujou Kamaji and Hiiragi Chisato were courting, but you can bet it's all anybody's talking about now.
Matsuura: Once the notices go out, that's it! The wedding is a sure thing, even if it hasn't happened just yet!
Kamisato Ayato: Hm. I see. It seems like I was wrong.
Matsuura: Hah! So suddenly we see eye to eye?
Kamisato Ayato: I had expected you to at least be smarter than most. But it seems that I was gravely mistaken.
Matsuura: Kamisato Ayato! You...! How dare you!
Kamisato Ayato: You've made your move. Now, I suppose it's time I made mine.
Matsuura: ...What do you mean?
Kamisato Ayato: Do you seriously think this marriage will bring the Kanjou Commission and the Tenryou Commission together?
Kamisato Ayato: Isn't it at all possible that the Kanjou Commission becomes marginalized as a consequence of this union?
Matsuura: ...Hmm?
Kamisato Ayato: Goodness me. Well, I've learned a great deal from talking to you. That will be all for now. If you would excuse me, I shall take my leave.
Paimon: Hey, hey! What was all that? Paimon didn't follow at all!
Kamisato Ayato: They had their scheme, but fortunately I was prepared. As I said, they ended up coming out from the shadows and revealing themselves.
Kamisato Ayato: Let's see how things are in Inazuma City. Then I'll take you through the details of my plan.
Traveler: (But he's also difficult to argue against...)

## Talk 5

Yuzu: Hmm, look at this... The daughter of the Kanjou Commission's Hiiragi Clan and the master of the Tenryou Commission's Kujou Clan are getting married.
Furuya Noboru: Hehe... Sounds like an all-around perfect match, don't you think?
Yuzu: For sure. I'm just surprised, it seems very sudden. I hadn't heard a single word about it until now.
Furuya Noboru: Good luck to them, I say. I'm sure it must have been a hard decision.

## Talk 6

Yuzu: I wonder if they'll go anywhere nice for their honeymoon? Maybe somewhere outside Inazuma...
Furuya Noboru: Don't tell me that you're thinking of adventuring in another nation again!

## Talk 7

Sayuri: A wedding between the Kujou Clan and the Hiiragi Clan? I didn't see that coming!
Mari: A relative of mine works in the Kanjou Commission. I'll ask her about it.
Mari: She's never mentioned it before, so... I don't know...

## Talk 8

Kujou Kamaji: Welcome. I just heard that the news of my wedding has been officially announced.
Kujou Kamaji: It seems so sudden... I wasn't ready yet.
Paimon: Yeah, about that... It's kinda complicated...
Black Screen Text: You briefly explain the situation to Kujou Kamaji...
Kujou Kamaji: I see... So someone's trying to take advantage of our marriage...
Kamisato Ayato: If you proceed with the wedding, the repercussions for you are likely to be minimal. But we must take Lady Hiiragi's situation into consideration.
Kujou Kamaji: I've previously considered this possibility. But in the end, we are getting married for true love, and I've promised to her that I'll do everything in my power to protect her.
Kamisato Ayato: I understand where you're coming from, but to be frank, she should not need your protection.
Kamisato Ayato: Or to put it another way, you have tacitly admitted that Lady Hiiragi will need your help to get through the hard times ahead, which perhaps suggests that, deep down, you realize all she stands to lose.
Kujou Kamaji: I...
Kamisato Ayato: I don't mean to criticize you. It is natural to want to protect our loved ones. You're an intelligent and gentle person, and I'm sure you would have been able to think about this more objectively were you not so emotionally involved in the situation.
Kamisato Ayato: I'm sure you admire Lady Hiiragi for being the independent, gentle, resilient, and strong-willed person she is.
Kamisato Ayato: For the sake of marrying you, this wonderful woman will become someone who has to depend on you for the rest of her life.
Kamisato Ayato: Are you really okay with that?
Kujou Kamaji: ...
Kujou Kamaji: I love her with all my heart and would do anything to make her happy...
Kujou Kamaji: ...That's why I cannot abide to see her suffer or be manipulated by other people.
Kujou Kamaji: Yashiro Commissioner, you're right... It was naive and selfish of me to take things this far.
Kujou Kamaji: But it's too late now, isn't it? There are notices everywhere...
Kamisato Ayato: I have a plan. But... it needs a villain.
Kamisato Ayato: Sir Kujou, in order for my plan to work, you and I must both play the role of antagonists. But it is not without its risks.
Kamisato Ayato: Are you willing to help?
Kujou Kamaji: If there's a way to salvage this, then let's hear it.
Kamisato Ayato: I've told the people at the Kanjou Commission that the marriage isn't going to unify the Kanjou Commission and the Tenryou Commission. On the contrary, it's a terrible idea that will marginalize the Kanjou Commission.
Kamisato Ayato: The context for this is that they are planning to use this marriage to bring down the Hiiragi Clan, and the key to their success is coming up against no resistance to the marriage from the Tenryou Commission.
Kamisato Ayato: But what if we were to imagine for a moment that since the affairs of the Vision Hunt Decree, the Tenryou Commission has been planning to make a move against the weakened Kanjou Commission...
Kamisato Ayato: The only reason you have been hesitant to act since taking over the Tenryou Commission is because you care about Lady Hiiragi's feelings.
Kamisato Ayato: And so, your plan is to liaise with the Yashiro Commission to marry her and bring her out of the Kanjou Commission as soon as possible.
Kamisato Ayato: Once that is achieved, as the person in charge of the Tenryou Commission, you no longer have any reason to hesitate.
Kujou Kamaji: I see! This is an ingenious plan, and takes advantage of the situation perfectly...
Traveler: This will make Hiiragi Chisato indispensable.
Kamisato Ayato: Exactly. Our purpose is to change Lady Hiiragi's position from an unnecessary burden to an indispensable asset.
Kamisato Ayato: By doing so, we can even strengthen her position in the Kanjou Commission.
Kamisato Ayato: Once our adversaries realize how the network of connections behind the scenes really looks, they'll do their utmost to stop this wedding from happening.
Kamisato Ayato: Then, we simply leave them to clear up the mess they've created.
Kujou Kamaji: Got it.
Paimon: Ugh... So the network of connections... Ah, this is all way too complicated for Paimon! Can you just tell us what you need us to do?
Kamisato Ayato: We have to make sure that the behind-the-scenes story comes to the attention of our dear friends in the Kanjou Commission.
Kamisato Ayato: Matsuura, with whom I spoke earlier, will now be fearing the worst. No doubt he'll be on the lookout for the first sign of a crisis.
Kamisato Ayato: In that case, he will almost certainly have placed informants throughout Inazuma City. What we need to do is to use these informants as a breeding ground for our fake intel.
Kamisato Ayato: Sir Kujou, there are certain things that I need you to attend to personally.
Black Screen Text: Kamisato Ayato explains the details of his plan to Kujou Kamaji. A while later...
Kamisato Ayato: It's almost time. My ninja has located one of the informants. Let's go and see if he'll take the bait.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Wow! It's like the whole Tenryou Commission is here!
Hideo: Excuse me, has something happened on this road?
Hideo: I'm a businessman passing through, and it's a little disconcerting to see this place so heavily guarded.
Okabayashi: Ah, please don't be alarmed. As I'm sure you've heard, the wedding of Sir Kujou Kamaji and Lady Hiiragi Chisato will take place any day now.
Okabayashi: Sir Kujou decided to send for Lady Hiiragi ahead of time and have her live in Inazuma City during the run-up to the wedding.
Hideo: I see...
Okabayashi: We are here to clear the way for Lady Hiiragi.
Okabayashi: Not just us, either. You'll see more Tenryou Commission members as you go further along. We're all here for the same duty.
Hideo: ...Isn't this a little excessive?
Okabayashi: Sir Kujou holds Lady Hiiragi in the highest regard and wants to treat her with the utmost respect from beginning to end.
Hideo: I understand... Sorry to disturb your work.
Hideo: Drat. It's exactly as Master feared.
Hideo: They say they're here to guard the road, but really they're poised to attack if Master doesn't allow Lady Hiiragi to leave Ritou...
Hideo: Wait, no... If Lady Hiiragi does leave, they'll have all the more reason to strike... But we're in no state to defend against a Tenryou Commission attack!
Hideo: I must tell Master right away!
Paimon: He ran off again...
Traveler: He looked like he'd seen a ghost.
Kamisato Ayato: That should do it, the seeds have been sown. In this atmosphere, mounting suspicion will nurture fear among the Kanjou Commission.
Kamisato Ayato: Now, we wait patiently for it to grow and ferment. The calm before the storm is always the part that unsettles people the most.
Paimon: Are they really gonna own up and apologize, just like that?
Kamisato Ayato: If you're curious to find out, you can visit the Hiiragi Clan in Ritou in a couple of days.
Kamisato Ayato: I have some other business to attend to. So I won't be spending any more time on this situation.
Kamisato Ayato: In any case, we've made our move. It's only a matter of time before they give up and surrender.
Traveler: Why are you so confident?
Kamisato Ayato: This is not my first time.
Kamisato Ayato: Well, then. Goodbye for now. I truly hope that things will work out in Hiiragi Chisato's best interests.
Paimon: He left kind of abruptly... Are things really gonna turn out like he predicted?
Traveler: Let's keep an eye on things until the end.
Paimon: Paimon too! Well, let's go to Ritou again in two days!
Traveler: I'm still a little worried about Hiiragi Chisato.
Traveler: Now he realizes how serious this situation is.
