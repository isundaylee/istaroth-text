Traveler: What are you doing?
Gaston: I traveled all the way here from Fontaine just to interview the owner of this place.
Gaston: I inquired about it everywhere, while people are constantly praising the architect who designed the place, no one knows who owns it.
Gaston: Isn't that an obvious scoop for me!?
Gaston: I may be just a trainee reporter from The Steambird, but I can't let that stop me. If I want to write an intriguing article, then I must be the first to eat the Specter!
Gaston: So, no matter how hard it is, I'm going to meet the owner of this place!

Traveler: See you.
Gaston: You're leaving already? Bye then. I'll be waiting a while longer.

Traveler: Persistence is the key!
