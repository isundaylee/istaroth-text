Kesean: Oho, back already? How did the jellyfish recovery operation go?
Traveler: It went pretty well.
Kesean: Great! Then I presume you also saw the Fluorescent Mucus they spit out?
Kesean: When jellyfish are startled, they can sometimes release their mucus that can help them escape or paralyze their enemies. Since the Violetglow Jellyfish are a cultivated species, however, their mucus is harmless, and shouldn't get in the way of the retrieval process.
Traveler: I feel like the mucus is following me...
Kesean: It is? Hmm, it might have gotten stuck on your equipment, or was probably just dragged by the current as you swam... I'd really love to look more into this...
Kesean: However, we have limited time right now, so let's worry about catching the jellyfish first.
Traveler: Not so well.
Kesean: What!? Was it because I didn't make it clear how to catch them?
Kesean: The jellyfish will release a eye-catching light under the water. You should be able to see it once you've checked out the waters around where they were released.
Kesean: All you'll need to do is to swim to their side, and then catch them when they're not looking, like so!
Kesean: We are nearly out of time... My freedom is completely in your hands now!
