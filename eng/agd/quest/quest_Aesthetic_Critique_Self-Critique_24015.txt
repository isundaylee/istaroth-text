# Aesthetic Critique: Self-Critique


## Talk 1

Paimon: Look up ahead! Depierris is just over there. C'mon!

## Talk 2

Depierris: *panting* Thank you... Really, thank you...
Depierris: Seriously, I was just painting over here — but before I knew it, they had me surrounded!
Depierris: They attacked my painting so vigorously, you'd think they wanted to eat it or something!
Depierris: But I couldn't let them have it, of course, so I grabbed it and ran...
Depierris: Didn't get far before they caught up, though — thank the Archons you were there to rescue me.
Traveler: Is there something wrong with this painting?
Depierris: A—Archons if I know! I've always used Whopperflower Nectar to make my paints — you know, the stuff you got for me previously?
Depierris: Wait... What if the paint was attracting them? No, that can't be — that nectar doesn't smell at all after I mix it into the paint!
Depierris: I daren't change the paint formula on the fly, either. Guess we'll have to find some other way...
Depierris: *cough* And here I thought that even the Whopperflowers could sense the beauty in my painting and wanted to come have a look at it.
Traveler: What did you do?
