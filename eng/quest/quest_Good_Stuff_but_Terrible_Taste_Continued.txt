# Good Stuff, but Terrible Taste — Continued


## Talk 1

Paimon: Phew, this looks so much better. Salsa would be proud of us if she saw this, don't you think so, Traveler?
Ubu: Robbers! A robbery in broad daylight!
Paimon: Huh!? Robbers? Where?
Ubu: I'm talking about you two! Not only did you destroy my masterpiece, you even took the chest...
Traveler: So it really was the work of an Adventurers' Guild member...
Ubu: What work on earth? I should be asking you guys about what you did!
Paimon: So, these ugly things are your "masterpieces"?
Ubu: The audacity! What do you mean "ugly things"? Haven't you heard of installation art?
Ubu: Looks like Fontaine's art education still has a long way to go... Oh, but you two don't look like you're from Fontaine.
Paimon: #That's because we are not from Fontaine. Paimon's Paimon, and {M#he}{F#she} is {NICKNAME}. We are also members of the Adventurers' Guild.
Traveler: We are members of an evil organization... *sob*
Paimon: Yeah, but we don't have to wear uniforms. So we're not bad guys in green, yay!
Ubu: I'm Ubu, an adventurer and installation artist. Seeing how you guys are making zero sense, I'm guessing you're often up to crazy shenanigans... I won't pursue this matter this time.
Paimon: Huh? Actually...
Ubu: What? I need to restore the work, so if you want to say thank you, do it quickly.
Salsa: I have nothing to thank you for, but I sure have a million things I wanna yell at you for!
Paimon: Salsa!
Salsa: With me around, you don't have to be scared, Paimon!
Salsa: Evil green guy, we have destroyed all of the traps laid by you! Stop trying to ruin our beautiful Fontaine with your sinister traps!
Ubu: Ruin? Wait, "destroyed all"? ...You destroyed all of my artworks!?
Paimon: Umm, we didn't exactly destroy them... We just rearranged them to suit the surrounding scenery...
Ubu: You...! You brats and plebeians! How could you hope to understand art! To turn my installation art, my works into something so mediocre and mundane...
Paimon: But is it really art? Paimon doesn't know much about it, but can you really call something that looks so out of place art?
Ubu: Of course, the boundaries of art are set by the artist. A work created by an artist is naturally called a work of art.
Salsa: Who's the artist?
Ubu: It is I, Ubu, the extraordinary installation artist.
Salsa: In that case, as the founder of the "Alliance of Artists to Overthrow the Evil Organization and Protect the Future of Fontaine," I declare that I do not recognize it as art.
Ubu: "Overthrow the E—" ...What?
Traveler: Overthrow the Evil Organization.
Paimon: It refers to the Adventurers' Guild that is ruining the scenery with, umm, installation art...
Ubu: What a joke, I've never heard of such an alliance. Kid, what gives you the right to say that my work isn't art?
Salsa: I'm a painter, so you could say I'm an artist. Of course I'm qualified.
Ubu: Huh? Look, kid, being an artist isn't some child's play. You can't say you're an artist just because you want to become one. You gotta have works that are recognized by people...
Salsa: So what makes you qualified? Your works, the installation art you speak of... Those evil traps? Do people clap when they see them?
Ubu: That's because there are too many plebeians who can't comprehend the charm of my works. True art is always the least understood...
Traveler: You should start from making art that people can actually understand.
Paimon: Yeah, if no one understands, it's either too avant-garde, or simply...
Ubu: No... It can't be! My works are perfect! There is absolutely nothing wrong with them! You guys just don't understand, people just don't understand...
Ubu: Darn it, I'm not giving up! This isn't over!
Black Screen Text: Ubu stumbles away...
Salsa: What a stubborn enemy! But I'm not giving up either! The future of Fontaine's art rests on my shoulders!
Traveler: We all have a goal to work towards.
Paimon: Is this a good thing? It probably is, right?
Traveler: Simply put, no one understands it at all.
Paimon: Which sounds like a failure...
Traveler: Basically, we have to take you down.
Traveler: Well hello there, buddy.
Paimon: Paimon doesn't think you can call someone buddy when you don't even know their name...
Traveler: Wait, it's the evil green guy!
Ubu: Hah, a robber who is spouting nonsense. What a day it is today!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hmm... Paimon can't stand how these objects look... Somehow, it reminds Paimon of those ugly things we saw last time...
Paimon: <color=#00E1FFFF>Why is there a Hydro Monument buried underground</color>? Paimon doesn't get it...
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, should we rearrange it? Just like how Salsa taught us!

## Talk 3

Salsa: #Hello, {NICKNAME} and Paimon!
Traveler: Did you manage to recruit new members for the alliance?
Salsa: I found prospective members who are willing to participate, but I need to carry out a rigorous assessment to make sure they have the right qualifications. After all, Fontaine's future is at stake.
Traveler: Not rushing home today?
Salsa: I've finished my homework, so I thought I'd hang around a little longer before heading home...
