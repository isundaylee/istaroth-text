Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Klee: It's really fun here!
Klee: The house is huge and there's a lot of room.
Klee: There are lots of new things here. It'll take a loooong time to run from one end of the road to the other.
Traveler: Sounds like you're having a fun time.
Klee: A really really fun time!
Klee: #If {F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight has time, Klee will play with you!
Klee: Catching lizards, chasing frogs, drawing, making crafts, hide-and-seek... There are so many fun things to do!
Traveler: You haven't been up to mischief, have you?
Klee: No! Definitely not!
Klee: #Master Jean told Klee many times that Klee can't destroy {F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight's house.
