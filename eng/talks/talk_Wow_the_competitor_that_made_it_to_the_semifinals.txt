Najah: Wow, the competitor that made it to the semifinals isn't part of the Amurta, but still had such high compatibility with her Fungi. I suppose logic doesn't apply to the legendary student!
Traveler: Legendary student?
Najah: Ah, if it isn't the renowned Golden Comet and Silver Companion in the flesh!
Najah: Didn't you guys just have a friendly match against her?
Paimon: You mean... Layla?
Paimon: Huh? Is that Layla's nickname? Can you tell us some more about it...?
Najah: So you guys don't know her very well, huh? All I know about her are the rumors that I've heard...
Najah: Legend has it that she would appear in various places in the dead of night... carefully observing the constellations. She's capable of swiftly moving between the points of observation and able to travel long distances with ease...
Paimon: That sounds weird... Something must've been wrong with their eyes!
Paimon: Layla doesn't exactly have the greatest stamina. It's impossible for her to do something like that!
Najah: I'm just sharing what I heard with you. As for whether the rumors are true... Well, that's none of my business. If you know more about her, feel free to tell me.
Traveler: We're not telling you.
Paimon: Yeah, it's not appropriate to tell others about someone without their consent... Go and become Layla's friend if you want to get to know her better.
Najah: Hah! You two really are polite, stand-up people!
Najah: It doesn't matter if it's true or not, it's merely a passing conversation. There's no need to invest time in proving it.
Najah: Sumeru is a big place. We belong to different Darshans and most likely won't cross paths again. We definitely won't meet again after this competition ends...
Paimon: Be that as it may... It still sounds a little cold...
Traveler: Get to know her yourself.
Traveler: See you around.
Najah: It's highly unlikely that we will. Goodbye, champion candidates.
