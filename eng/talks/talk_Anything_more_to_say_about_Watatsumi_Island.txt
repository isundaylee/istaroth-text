Traveler: Anything more to say about Watatsumi Island?
Moriguchi: If you've only been here for a short while, don't be misled into thinking that every island of Inazuma is as run-down as this dump.
Moriguchi: My homeland, Watatsumi Island, could not be more different from this place in terms of scenery.
Moriguchi: Watatsumi Island has many highlands with numerous waterfalls, with Sangonomiya in their center. And Sangonomiya itself is a most beautiful place. Not only are there gigantic corals, but also vegetation with colors totally different from those you'd see anywhere else...
Moriguchi: Back in the day, I would always run up the highlands to admire Sangonomiya. I even met my wife there when she was harvesting flowers. Hahaha!
Moriguchi: *sigh* The more I talk about it, the more I miss her so dearly...
