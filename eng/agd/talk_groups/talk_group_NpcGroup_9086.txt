Wriothesley: #Hello there, Traveler.
Wriothesley: I was just thinking about finding a patch of grass to lie down if you don't need me for anything.

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Wriothesley: Hmm, I quite like the environment. The temperature and humidity are both near perfect. It's a very fitting place for a leisurely vacation.
Wriothesley: You really are quite something, to possess such a cozy and comfortable haven, but still be willing to venture out into the unknown.
Traveler: There are some things that I must do.
Wriothesley: You speak with conviction. I can tell those matters are extremely important to you.
Wriothesley: It's not a bad thing to be committed to a goal. It can prevent you from losing your way in life.
Wriothesley: But don't let your convictions control you and lead you down a dangerous path, okay?
Wriothesley: After all, this wonderful place is still waiting for your return.
Traveler: Life is all about being on the move.
Wriothesley: Huh, I like the sound of that phrase. I just might write it down and add it to one of the regulations at the Fortress of Meropide.
Wriothesley: Should I say that it came from you?
Traveler: Nope, that responsibility's all yours.
Wriothesley: Ahh, you saw right through me.
Wriothesley: Don't worry, though. I was just joking around.
Wriothesley: If I was actually going to add some new kind of rule, I will be sure to take full responsibility for it.

Traveler: Would you like to chat?
Wriothesley: Sure. Got anything on your mind?
Wriothesley: Talking about the weather is usually a great way to get a conversation going, but it seems like the weather here is always the same.
Traveler: That's the work of Tubby, the teapot spirit.
Wriothesley: I see, so the keeper of this place is a teapot spirit...
Wriothesley: When I first arrived, I had actually mistaken her for one of those large finchbill pets.
Traveler: Don't judge a book by its cover.
Wriothesley: Yeah, you're right.
Wriothesley: Speaking of which, I actually made a similar mistake when I was young. I once thought that Melusines were the form that sea hares took when they hopped onto land.
Wriothesley: It wasn't until I read some books that I realized just how silly I was.
Wriothesley: You should know that according to laws and regulations, Melusines are also recognized citizens of Fontaine. It is forbidden to view or treat them as pets or monsters.
Traveler: I figured it was something like that.
Wriothesley: Good, that makes for one less legal trouble you may get yourself into.
Wriothesley: Although it'd be great to have more people working in the Fortress, I've never been interested in instigating crime.
Wriothesley: It is my hope that people will use more legitimate channels to find work in the Fortress of Meropide. There's no need to cause headaches for the upstanding ladies and gentlemen of the Palais Mermonia.
Traveler: First time I've ever heard of it...
Wriothesley: I believe you owe me a big thank-you, then.
Wriothesley: Criminals that disrespect Melusines usually get slapped with a pretty hefty sentence.

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Wriothesley: I'd like to take a quick walk around here. Would you mind?
Traveler: Not at all. It's not like I can keep you in my sights all the time anyway.
Wriothesley: Our combat abilities aside, I will definitely stay put if that's what you prefer.
Wriothesley: However, you've also gotten to know me a bit by now. It's true that I'm not accustomed to staying in an unfamiliar place for long.
Wriothesley: But this is your home. We don't have to worry about danger here, right?
Wriothesley: I'm curious, that's all. I just want to take a walk around this vast, miraculous place as if I were a tourist.
Traveler: I can show you some other teapot realms, too, if you'd like.
Wriothesley: Wait, really?
Wriothesley: So, as long as you wish it, you can visit each of the seven nations without ever having to step outside?
Traveler: Want to give it a try?
Wriothesley: Haha, well, opportunities like that don't just come by every day.
Wriothesley: If you want something, you should try your best to fight for it, won't you agree?
Traveler: Got it, I'll go switch up the realms for you.
Wriothesley: And I would be ever so grateful.
Wriothesley: Obviously, I am also aware that there is no such thing as a free lunch.
Wriothesley: So, if you are ever in need of my help, don't let anything hold you back. We will always welcome you at the Fortress of Meropide.
Wriothesley: Of course, with that said, I hope you won't be coming down because of a new sentence.
Traveler: I can already see your excitement.
Traveler: I figured you would've already explored the place.
Wriothesley: That would have been true if we were elsewhere... Making sure that my surroundings are safe is essential.

Traveler: Good morning, Your Grace.
Wriothesley: It's not every day that we get to meet in the overworld. There's no need to be so formal.
Wriothesley: Morning. I hope you'll have a wonderful day.

Traveler: Good night, Wriothesley.
Wriothesley: Good night.
Wriothesley: The daytime hours are always full of sound and fury, so I've developed a habit of saving work that requires more considered thinking for the evening.
Wriothesley: However... I'll pass on that while I'm here. Allow me to space out for a little longer.

Wriothesley: Not bad. It really looks the part.
Wriothesley: Anyone who gets to compete in a tournament here must be the cream of the crop, since you're the one sending out the invitations.
Wriothesley: So, I'll pass — save myself the embarrassment. Besides... I make a good spectator.

## Talk 10

Wriothesley: If I didn't know better, I'd think you were trying to coax me into working from your place so you can pry into the Fortress of Meropide's most closely guarded secrets...
Wriothesley: Well, I hate to break it to you, but the majority of my day-to-day work is mundane accounting.
Wriothesley: So I could consider working here, but only if... Well, let's put it this way — how good's your math?
