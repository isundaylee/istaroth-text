Traveler: Hope you're settling in okay.
Yae Miko: Thank you for your concern, dear. But, believe me, I am quite comfortable wherever I go.
Yae Miko: So, this must be an adepti abode... Hmm, though it's a bit different from what I imagined, it's still most fascinating.
Yae Miko: At first glance, the act of containing this vast space inside a tiny little tea pot seems strikingly similar to the art of constructing a space from the imagination. But as it turns out, they work on fundamentally different principles.
Traveler: So you're researching how it works, huh?
Yae Miko: As Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine, it is my duty to seek out and master all forms of knowledge and power. Only then am I capable of handling whatever phenomena come our way.
Yae Miko: Besides, if I can get the hang of this teapot trick, I'll be able to bring an unlimited supply of sake and snacks with me wherever I go...
Traveler: Aha, so that's the real reason for your "research"!
Yae Miko: Hehe... regardless, please do look after me while I'm visiting this lovely little teapot of yours.
