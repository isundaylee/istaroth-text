# Abyss Mage


## Talk 1

Diluc: The Abyss Order... Enemies of the human race. Even the underground networks rarely come across any information on them.
Diluc: With that said, it was a bit of a hassle, but I managed to dig up a few clues.
Venti: Really? That quickly? You really are well connected, Master Diluc.
Paimon: Come to think of it, Mr. Big Anemo God Barbatos — why exactly do you need the help of mere humans...?
Venti: Ahh... How do I put it...
Venti: "The Seven" as people now know them, were once known as "The Seven Archons."
Venti: Each archon presides over their own part of Teyvat. That is the role the archons play.
Venti: Only in performing this duty can we attain power, but I don't like the idea of "ruling" Mondstadt — and I don't feel Mondstadt would really like it either.
Jean: "Go forth and establish a city of freedom without rule." We have not forgotten Barbatos' wish for Mondstadt.
Paimon: Jean... You're such a devotee!
Paimon: Maybe someone got a little too free and is just too lazy to care...
Venti: Ahh... However it may have come to be... I haven't been back to Mondstadt for an extended period of time.
Venti: Without a doubt, I am now the weakest archon among The Seven!
Traveler: And yet you sound almost proud...
Venti: Aww, you flatter me.
Diluc: Oh, such a humble god... Is it a blessing, or a curse?
Diluc: But we digress. Let's get back to the topic at hand: the common enemy of all mankind.
Diluc: We have tracked the *Abyss Mage* to the vicinity of the *winery*.
Jean: I cannot stress enough how important it is to not let it escape.
Traveler: Let's hunt it down!
Traveler: Guess that's why you're god to the City of Freedom...

## Talk 2

Venti: Huh? What's this...
Venti: After the Abyss Mage was defeated, a certain energy dispersed from its body...
Venti: It seems that energy was being used to cut off the connection between me and Dvalin.
Venti: ...
Venti: #Traveler, do you know of *Stormterror's Lair*?
Traveler: Nope.
Venti: But Jean and Master Diluc are no doubt aware of it.
Venti: After Dvalin woke up, he took the ancient ruins as his lair.
Venti: As it was with the storms that previously cut Mondstadt off from the outside world, the entrance to the ruins is also sealed by a special barrier.
Venti: But now, as the energy dispersed from the Abyss Mage, I was able to read the rhythmic flow of how the barrier's magic was woven.
Venti: I must admit, it sounds even more horrendous than a chorus of hilichurls, but...
Venti: ...It should be enough to let us break through the storm barrier and reach *Stormterror's Lair*.
Diluc: Which means we're going to confront Dvalin?
Diluc: I'm fine with that... Jean is the one who wishes to avoid any direct confrontation.
Jean: No. When there are no other options left, it is my responsibility to alter our course of action.
Jean: If slaying him is our only choice, I will gladly become the knight that leads the charge.
Venti: Fortunately, we have yet to need to go that far.
Diluc: Hmm?
Jean: By that, you mean...
Venti: I mean that the Holy Lyre is not our trump card.
Venti: #Our real trump card? Traveler of course.
Paimon: #Traveler?
Traveler: Is it because I purified the Teardrop Crystal?
Venti: Agreed.
Venti: The impurities in the tears, and the curse that binds Dvalin belong to the same maleficent power.
Venti: Which means...
Paimon: You Tone-Deaf Bard, don't you see how crazy this is?
Paimon: #You've seen what Dvalin is like when he's ticked off! Traveler will be swallowed whole before he even gets to lift a finger!
Traveler: Weren't we just talking about how I can fight?
Diluc: ...Hey.
Diluc: Nice plan. Worth a shot.
Jean: I am with you, Honorary Knight!
Paimon: Ho~! So we just need to fight monsters from the abyss... and a dragon! No pressure or anything.
Diluc: Humans aren't without their strengths. Let's go.
Venti: And so...
Venti: The epic actions of brave heroes finally leads to this eleventh hour.
Traveler: This battle... it's going to take everything everyone's got.
Traveler: Is it because I can fight?
Venti: Well, you could say that... You're definitely a force to be reckoned with.
Venti: But you have a much more precious forte.
Traveler: I think I've heard people talking about it in Mondstadt.
Venti: Of course. I believe the people of Mondstadt all know of it.
