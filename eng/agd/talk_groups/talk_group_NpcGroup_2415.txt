Traveler: What are you doing?
Flagpole Cheng: Just following orders from Sarge. If the enemy attacks, I have to report it straight away...
Flagpole Cheng: But I'm short-sighted, and... I'm still waiting on my new spectacles after I broke the last pair...
Flagpole Cheng: In the meantime... *sigh* Let's just hope it stays calm around here.

Traveler: Seen anyone around that looks a lot like me?
Flagpole Cheng: Oh... So you were looking for someone to talk you... You gave me a fright.
Flagpole Cheng: Speaking of which, someone did show up some time ago who had a very similar silhouette to yours...
Flagpole Cheng: ...But my glasses had already been broken before that. It's also possible that you passed this way earlier and I caught sight of you.
Flagpole Cheng: So, is the person I saw the one you're looking for? I don't know either...
