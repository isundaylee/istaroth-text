# Fortune Slip

A special slip of paper that can illuminate one's fortune. Also known to a certain someone as "strips of paper."
You can only get one of these per day, which will cause the previous day's fortune slip to lose meaning and disappear.
They say that slips that portend ill luck such as "Misfortune" and "Great Misfortune" can be tied to the Fortune Slip Hanger as a prayer for a turnaround.
Regardless, "fate" and "destiny" are things best grasped and forged in one's own hands.
