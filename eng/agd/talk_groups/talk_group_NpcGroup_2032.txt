Bibo: Hey there. If you're here to view the goods, I'm afraid I'm still waiting on the latest delivery...
Bibo: But trust me, it'll be worth the wait. Everything I sell is freshly acquired, straight off the boat!

Traveler: Are you a fishmonger?
Bibo: Fishmonger? Are you trying to suss me out or something? No need, let me tell you how it is, plain and simple.
Bibo: Let's put it like this: I can get you whatever you need, from wherever it is — as long as the price is right.
Bibo: Even if it's from Inazuma, if you catch my drift.

Traveler: Tell me more about Inazuma.
Bibo: Before, it would have been a monumental task to get to Inazuma. If you were lucky enough to make it across the ocean alive, that border would be impenetrable.
Bibo: But that's all in the past now. The trade routes have been opened, so I can get over there and get you anything you need, whenever you need it!

Traveler: See you.
Bibo: Alright, if you're not buying then don't stick around... We don't want to attract the Millelith's attention...

Bibo: Tell me more about Inazuma.
Bibo: For the average person, getting into Inazuma is nigh on impossible!
Bibo: Even if you're lucky enough to make it across the ocean alive, that border is simply impenetrable.
Bibo: I do not understand their national administration's mindset. Far too isolationist in my opinion...
Bibo: Not long ago, I actually rescued a girl who escaped from Inazuma... She's the only person I've ever known to get out of there without official approval.
Bibo: So, if you're one of these who is desperate for a new Inazuman toy to play with, I'm telling you — let it go!
