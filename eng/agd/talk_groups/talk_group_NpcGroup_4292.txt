Masseira: The winds will inevitably sweep the dust and sands aside, but from what may we find the power to invoke the presence of wind itself...

Traveler: Wind?
Masseira: Hmm... To regard an outlander such as you...
Masseira: Never mind. Cast it from your thoughts. Mellifluous though the voice of the canary may be, how, yet, can a mere melodious voice rupture the webs of affection.

Traveler: I don't understand what you're trying to say...
Masseira: Then, stranger, perhaps you should regard my words as but passing wind.

## Talk 4

Masseira: "Flap flap flap," and the little canary returns! Hehe! Congratulations!
Traveler: What?
Masseira: Look at you! Look. At. You. The little canary got the poisonous scorpion all tied around itself without even knowing what happened... Amazing! Truly amazing!
Masseira: But... that little wildcat, like you, is so very ignorant of the great net she has found herself in, relying only on intuition and instinct to struggle and strain...
Masseira: "Ripping, tearing..." Will she sink deeper, I wonder?
Traveler: What are you even saying?
Masseira: Oh, oh! I have aroused your anger, I see!
Masseira: Haha. It is nothing... Please, take care of her, for she is a good child.
Traveler: I'm no canary.
Masseira: Oh, and are you a little falcon, then? Hah, but you must overcome my falcon first for that to be the case!

## Talk 5

Masseira: Spoken to Babel, have you? Ah, she's probably busying herself somewhere else again... You would sooner stop the wind than stop her.
Masseira: Haha... You know, youngster, speaking of the wind... I'd like to remind you of a kind of desert wind that we call "Zibri."
Masseira: At first, you won't sense anything, until the sandstorm rises over the horizon, and the air itself begins to ascend and burn. Only then will you realize...
Masseira: ...That you can no longer smell anything, for the heated air has smothered your sense of smell, seared your nostrils...
Masseira: By then... Heh. By then, it will be too late.
Traveler: I'm afraid I didn't catch your drift...
Masseira: It's nothing... I just mean to say that you should be careful of the sandstorms.

## Talk 6

Masseira: Hehe, so it's you... Youngster, I have heard that you and Jeht went into the accursed city. Ah, and you would like to know how I know this, yes?
Masseira: Hunters have falcons and hounds to be their eyes and ears, naturally. But young one, I must remind you that this word, the "curse," comes not out of thin air.
Masseira: A venom, the root of all tragedy, that drives all humans add, is hidden within a facade of flowing gold.
Masseira: Perhaps it shall be so this time as well, that greedy prey shall fall into a trap, where they cannot be saved...

## Talk 7

Masseira: Oh, if it isn't our esteemed guest...
Masseira: Color me impressed! What you did was a feat for the ages.
Masseira: Perhaps one day, should I ask for your help, I hope that you'll still be willing to offer it.
Traveler: I'll give you a hand when the time comes.
Masseira: Then I thank you in advance.

Masseira: Perhaps one day, should I ask for your help, I hope that you'll still be willing to offer it.
Traveler: Sure, but shall we play a round of cards first?
Masseira: Cards? With you? It will be my pleasure.
Traveler: I'll give you a hand when the time comes.
Masseira: Then I thank you in advance.
