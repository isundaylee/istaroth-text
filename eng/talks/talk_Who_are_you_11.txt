# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Who are you?
Glory: Sorry, where are my manners! Allow me to introduce myself â€” I'm Glory.
Glory: I come here often, waiting for Godwin to come back... I pray he manages to avoid those rotten hilichurls and the Abyss Order on the way... so he can come back and be with me soon.
Glory: Ah, I'm rambling again... Sorry, it's just so nice having someone to talk to.
Traveler: Who is Godwin?
Glory: He's the man I love. He's with the Knights, and he's away with Grand Master Varka's expedition.
Glory: It was hard to let him go, but I was so proud of him managing to join Varka's expedition party.
Glory: ...Sadly, I don't know when the expedition is supposed to end. All I can do is wait here for him.
Traveler: Tell me more about the hilichurls and the Abyss Order.
Glory: You must find them a nuisance too? All they do is go round causing mischief.
Glory: I heard that most of the hilichurls suddenly appeared in Teyvat out of nowhere several hundred years ago... And the same for the Abyss Order, actually.
Glory: Some said they were borne of some great catastrophe that descended on Teyvat... But I think they probably came from outer space!
Glory: ...Sorry, because I can't see, my imagination sometimes runs a bit wild. Just ignore it.
