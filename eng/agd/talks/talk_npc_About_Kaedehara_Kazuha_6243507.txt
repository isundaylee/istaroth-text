Traveler: About Kaedehara Kazuha...
Little Yue: Eh? That name sure sounds familiar... Oh, right, you mean that red-garbed guy from abroad!
Little Yue: He always sits by himself saying some real complicated stuff... But I've heard Uncle Liushi say that this guy can tell the weather as well as he can!
Little Yue: He even played me a tune once on a leaf. I never even knew that was possible!
Little Yue: So... I guess he's a good guy!
