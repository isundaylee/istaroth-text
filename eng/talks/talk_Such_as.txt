Jiewu: For example, a certain merchant from Fontaine was invited to tea during his visit to Qiaoying Village. As soon as the water entered the teapot, he poured it into the cups without waiting and gulped it down, praising its rich aroma...
Jiewu: Little did he know that it was merely the water used to rinse the tea set... and the rich aroma he spoke of? That was just the remnants of the last pot of tea.
Jiewu: Seeing this, the host did not embarrass the merchant and took a few sips as well. After that, the host brewed a pot of fine tea and offered it to the merchant.
