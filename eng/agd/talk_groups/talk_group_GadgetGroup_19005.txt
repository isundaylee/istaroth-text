Traveler: About these books...
Osse: Fascinating, no? These books have all been infused with the mysterious power of the "symphony." They can be activated using the melodies of the music box.
Osse: Ah, but we can't do that right now. There's a book missing here. Let's go look for it in the area.
Osse: Worry not, these books aren't dangerous in themselves. But perhaps there's something unexpected hidden behind them.
Osse: What could it be? I couldn't say for sure, so you should go find out yourself! There are many secrets in this castle that even I haven't discovered yet...

## Talk

Traveler: It's nothing.
Osse: Alright. If there is anything you wish to know, do not hesitate to ask me.

Osse: Well done. It looks as if you can now skillfully manipulate this musical might. I was right to put my faith in you.
Osse: There are many books like this one in the castle. Back in the day...
Osse: Nay, let us not dwell on the past. I believe you are fully capable of discovering the mysteries within.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell us about your relationship to this castle...
Osse: You've guessed it already, I reckon. In the past, when I could still change my form freely, he... and I, and many of our companions dwelled here.
Osse: In those days, a new nation had just been born, and as far as we were concerned, the possibilities were yet endless.
Osse: Here, we organized the classics, researching music theory and magic, in the hopes that we might tame this perilous power and use it to open up a brighter age.
Osse: But... These possibilities would quickly become lost to us, and I alone remained...
Traveler: Osse...
Osse: It's fine. These things happened a long time ago.
