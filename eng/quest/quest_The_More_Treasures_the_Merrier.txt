# The More Treasures the Merrier


## Talk 1

Marjorie: This is bad... Very bad...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Marjorie: Traveler! Just the person I needed to see. Did you know this is my souvenir shop?
Marjorie: My dad used to wait till the adventurers came back and buy their spoils of war from them to sell in the shop.
Marjorie: But since things started dying down at the Adventurers' Guild, my opportunities to stock up have been few and far between.
Marjorie: Not only that, but recently the items we get in are hardly worth anything. Nobody wants to buy them.
Marjorie: Traveler, your adventures take you all over the place, don't they? Could I trouble you to bring me back some treasures that I can sell next time?
Traveler: I'll keep my eyes peeled.
Marjorie: Thank you! Whatever you bring me, I will make sure to get a good price for.
Traveler: Actually, Paimon is worth a pretty penny.
Marjorie: I'm sorry, but nobody wants to buy that.
Marjorie: My customers tend to prefer objects of the more inanimate variety.

## Talk 2

Marjorie: Everything clear? Off you go then, I'll be waiting.
