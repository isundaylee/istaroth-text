Traveler: Do you need a hand?
Toyanna: Oh, it's okay. Don't worry about it. It's no big problem. Or rather, it's no problem at all â€” it's just something I'm taking issue with...
Toyanna: I'm the air traffic staff responsible for directing landing Qucusaurs.
Toyanna: It's not usually a problem when there are only a few of them. But if a large number are returning to base all at the same time, then I need to use hand or flag signals to command them.
Toyanna: Sometimes we've got all these Saurians trying to land on the same flat patch of land at the same time, which is pure chaos.
