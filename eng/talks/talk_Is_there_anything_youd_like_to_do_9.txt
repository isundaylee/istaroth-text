Klee: #{F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight, pleeeeaaaase.
Traveler: Alright then...
Klee: Then let's get started!
Klee: #I'll be responsible for making Jumpy Dumpties, so {F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight can give jobs to them.
Klee: We need a shopkeeper, a chef, an artist, a circus performer...
Traveler: Those don't sound like army ranks...
Klee: It's okay! They're here for Ludi Harpastum.

Traveler: Sure, I can help out.
Klee: #Yay, {F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight is the best!
