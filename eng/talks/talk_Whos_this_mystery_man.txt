Traveler: Who's this mystery man?
Granny Ruoxin: Gosh, here I am at my age sharing my gossip with an avid listener! Well I never...
Granny Ruoxin: The last time I saw him was when he boarded a ship bound for some faraway place, ready to go off on an adventure. He promised we would settle down together at Mt. Qingce when he returned.
Granny Ruoxin: Maybe you're destined to live a lie when you choose to be an actress. Because those parting words spoken by my lover when he left have turned out to be the biggest lie of my whole life.
Granny Ruoxin: You wonder if I'm still waiting for him?
Granny Ruoxin: Haha... Who knows. The luster of my youth has long since worn off, so what does it matter anyway.
