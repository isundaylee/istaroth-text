# Talk Dialog

Ei: ...
Traveler: You seem... unsettled.
Ei: ...Since leaving the Plane of Euthymia, I seem to experience this feeling more and more, whether in the markets of Inazuma or before the Sacred Sakura...
Traveler: I seem to have a hand in a lot of those... I'm sorry.
Ei: No, it may not be a bad thing. In the Plane of Euthymia, I could not perceive the consequences of my choices, but that did not preclude their impact.
Ei: It is only natural that I would feel their effect one day. Even a god cannot sever the link between cause and effect.
Ei: I have come to realize that isolating oneself from all engagement... is no way to reach a true state of "euthymia."
Traveler: ...
Ei: I will not unleash Musou no Hitotachi this time. I can only support you in the battle ahead.
Ei: #Using illusion against illusion, dream against nightmare... The ultimate success of this plan comes down to you, Traveler.
Traveler: (This is a last-minute plan, we don't exactly know what we're about to face, and it could all fall through at a moment's notice... But, one thing is for sure.)
Traveler: ...This time, you will not face her alone.
Sayu: Did... Did we do it...?
Gorou: Phew, just in time...
Thoma: And, it's done...
Arataki Itto: Woohoo! Right on! Big dubs for the team!
Mamoru (Mamoru, Akira, and Genta): The Arataki Gang rules!
Akira (Mamoru, Akira, and Genta): The Arataki Gang rules!
Genta (Mamoru, Akira, and Genta): The Arataki Gang rules!
Nightmare Fragments: Heh...!
Arataki Itto: Whâ€”What in the...
Nightmare Fragments: ...Heh...
Kujou Sara: Don't panic! Just follow the plan!
Ei: #Prepare yourself, Traveler.
Traveler: Already done.
Ei: Alright, follow me!
