# Talk Dialog

Machinna: It doesn't matter how long you hesitate, the result won't change, so you might as well just give up already.
Kumayo: No, that isn't how it works. You have to assess the team's overall strength, then consider all possible outcomes of each match...
Izze: ...And then bank on the "unexpected" happening?
Kumayo: Pff, you're a fine one to talk!
Machinna: Our boy's only telling you how it is. You've bet on so many matches now, yet despite all your "calculations," your bets haven't turned out any better than his random guesses.
Kumayo: That's just because the sample size is too small! You wait and see. Once I've bet on a load more, I'll create a graph with all the data...
Izze: ...And then spend another three weeks washing dishes?
Kumayo: Tsk, more meaningless speculation! If you're going to make random guesses anyway, why don't you give your old pa the benefit of the doubt, for once?
