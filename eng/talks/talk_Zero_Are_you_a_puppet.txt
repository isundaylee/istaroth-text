# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Zero. Are you... a puppet?
Sitt: Heh, it might be better to be a puppet. I just need to follow the program, and won't get angry even if someone interrupts my speech.
Sitt: But I'm more or less like that already...
Sitt: After a few years of being a receptionist at the Akademiya, I've memorized the admissions brochure so thoroughly that I can recite it ad verbatim.
Sitt: As long as people come seeking to be educated, and the Akademiya still exists, I'll never be done with work.
Sitt: Phew... I haven't had a normal conversation in a long time. Thank you.
