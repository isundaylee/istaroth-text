Traveler: Tell me more about Seishimaru.
Okazaki Rikuto: Oh, so you're interested in this tale, are you, youngster?
Okazaki Rikuto: I shan't hide it from you, then. Seishimaru was once a relative of mine.
Okazaki Rikuto: His tale was the talk of the town back in the day â€” not that I'd expect any young people to know of it now, though.
Okazaki Rikuto: I've lived for several decades myself and seen my own fair share of things. In truth, real life is often more exciting than fiction, hehe.
