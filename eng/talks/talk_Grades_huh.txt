Traveler: Grades, huh...
Ikeda Soushirou: Yeah, youngster, studying is of the utmost importance. You need to study hard and train hard. Only one who is a fine warrior and scholar both can become the backbone of the Kujou Clan.
Ikeda Soushirou: If you asked me, the youngsters from the Kujou Clan should learn from Sara! Sara excels at martial arts and is very loyal to the Kujou Clan. Although she was adopted by Takayuki, she is still far more reliable than many actual clan members, haha!
