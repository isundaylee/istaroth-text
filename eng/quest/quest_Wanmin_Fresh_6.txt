## Talk 1

Traveler: I've got something else to do.
Chef Mao: Ah, alright. I'll think of another way...

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'll deliver it right now.
Chef Mao: I'm counting on you, then.
Chef Mao: Do be careful. <color=#00E1FFFF>Don't touch any strange elements, and try not to get injured</color>, either.

## Talk 3

Tacit Tingfang: Hmm. I'm hungry.

## Talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: You heard correctly. Someone named Tingfang ordered a serving of Jewelry Soup earlier before heading off to Qingxu Pool.
Chef Mao: I don't know what matter he needs to attend to, but I can say with confidence that you can't find any fault with our Jewelry Soup.
Chef Mao: Could I trouble you to deliver this Jewelry Soup for me? <color=#00E1FFFF>Just try not to use your wind glider to get there</color>, or some of the soup might spill.
