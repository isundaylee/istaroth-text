## Talk

Vitruvia: Hello there. Is there any legal service I can provide?

## Talk

Traveler: You're an... attorney?
Vitruvia: Well, I wish I could've become a Champion Duelist, but that's not happening in this life, I reckon.
Vitruvia: I can't fight — like, I really can't. I'm the type who can knock herself on the head with a sheathed sword...
Vitruvia: But if there's a talent I do have, that's searching. As long as the case details are clear, I can quickly find all the relevant legal clauses.

## Talk

Traveler: So, you do legal consultancy?
Vitruvia: To be precise, I do consultancy on how to "escape the law."
Vitruvia: My goal is to let my clients avoid run-ins with Champion Duelists and avoid entering the theater — except to enjoy performances, that is.
Vitruvia: This is not hard to do. All legal systems have their flaws — and I know them as well as I do the holes in my socks.
Vitruvia: Hmm... Speaking of that, I should probably spend some Mora to get a pair of new ones.

Traveler: I'm afraid not.
Vitruvia: Ah, what a shame... I mean, how fortunate!
