Traveler: So, tell me about the Guhua Clan.
Gaiman: Well, it was once a flourishing organization in Liyue. Back then, they were even called the Guhua Brotherhood.
Gaiman: But now, there are few if any who would call themselves Guhua disciples.
Gaiman: I bought a batch of swords from someone who claimed to be a Guhua disciples some days back. He claimed that they were the Clan's hidden treasures.
Gaiman: But the boss at the smithy informed me two days later that they were just run-of-the-mill weapons.
Gaiman: *sigh* I didn't think that charlatans from Liyue could be so deceitful. Well, these swords are a burden to me as-is, so why don't you take them? Out of sight, out of mind, as they say!
