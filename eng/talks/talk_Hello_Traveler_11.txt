Hertha: Hello, Traveler.
Traveler: Need something from me?
Hertha: I'm Hertha, Captain of the Knights of Favonius' 6th Company.
Hertha: My work mostly includes the charter and administration of our baggage train, resource management and record-keeping.
Hertha: Well, Mondstadt's present state is as you've no doubt seen.
Hertha: With the Grand Master having taken much of our manpower with him, we have since been in a constant state of short-handedness.
Hertha: At the same time, our inventory is running a surplus to match... So I'm more than willing to exchange some of it for a little hand here and there.
Hertha: But things can get complicated here in the city, so we need experienced hands to make sure that things get done properly.
Hertha: If you're willing and you've got the confidence, you're free to have a gander at it.
Hertha: With any luck, we'll take some of the burden off our Acting Grand Master's shoulders...
Hertha: I've already sorted the available tasks out for you. The details are right here.
