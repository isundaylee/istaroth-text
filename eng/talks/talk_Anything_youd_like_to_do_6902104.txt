Traveler: *Anything you'd like to do?*
Amber: Let's have dinner together!
Amber: It doesn't need to be anything sophisticated. I just want to enjoy the feeling of having a meal at home. It's quite different from eating out.
Amber: Restaurants are convenient and all, and you can always trust that the food's gonna be good.
Amber: But you only get that special cozy feeling when you're eating at home, you know?
Traveler: Yeah, I know what you mean.
Amber: Great! Then what are we waiting for?
Amber: Right, we'll do some steak, and— Oh, wait... you must have had my Outrider's Champion Steak a million times already.
Amber: You know what, it's high time I set myself a new culinary challenge.
Amber: ...Ooh, and I know just the dish — today, I'll try my hand at a Sticky Honey Roast!
Amber: Uh... But what if the smoke changes the color of your ceiling...
Traveler: I was thinking of painting it a new color anyway.
Traveler: Don't worry, I can help with the cooking.
Amber: Hehe, you're so kind to me.
Amber: Get ready for the most delicious meal you've ever eaten! ...Even if it takes me a few hundred times.
Amber: I can't wait...
Traveler: Alright, let's do it.
Amber: Really!?
