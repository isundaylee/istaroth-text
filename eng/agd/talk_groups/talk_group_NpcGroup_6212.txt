Huatli: Hello there. Um... What time is it now? Noon? Or evening?

## Talk

Traveler: Err, are you alright?
Huatli: Sorry, sorry, let me have a look around first. Oh, boy. So it's this late, huh?
Huatli: *cough* Don't worry, I'm fully awake now! Iâ€”I was just meditating back there, that's all!
Huatli: I love the sky. The positions of the sun, the moon, and the stars... They aren't just randomly scattered like Grainfruit in soup.
Huatli: Of course, I've also heard that some people like to divine fortunes with leftover tea leaves or coffee residue, but... Hehe, well, sounds like child's play to me.

## Talk

Traveler: Look up at the sky.
Huatli: Ah, right, yes. The skies tell all.

## Talk

Traveler: At least tea and coffee taste good, right?
Huatli: Oh sure, that they do, and I love them too. Great way to jolt yourself awake.
Huatli: Ah... *yawn* Speaking of which, I'm getting sleepy again...
Huatli: Wait, no. I mean, I should go meditate again. Let's chat again when we get the chance, alright? See you!
