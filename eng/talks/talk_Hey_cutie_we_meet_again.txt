Lisa: Hey cutie, we meet again.
Traveler: This place sure wasn't easy to find.
Lisa: Oh, really? I used to live in Sumeru City and now that I'm back, I can't help but want to visit these small, remote shops.
Lisa: It's a pity that my old favorite clothing shop has already been closed for some time.
Lisa: I wanted to buy some accessories and clothes to give to the other ladies in the Knights of Favonius. Hmm... what a pity.
Traveler: I see you bought some new clothes.
Lisa: I was wondering when you would notice. Well, what do you think?
Traveler: It's classy.
Lisa: It's always nice to hear compliments from other people, especially you. Thank you, cutie.
Lisa: I managed to find the owner of that old clothing shop and had it custom tailored.
Lisa: Wearing it reminds me of my days at the Akademiya. What a busy time that was for me...
Lisa: However, my researchers were never lazy, unlike the people who borrow books and don't return them. Now that I think of it, punishing them with a zap of Electro may have still been too lenient...
Traveler: Very elegant.
Traveler: Your new outfit looks great.
