Yukom: *sigh* I didn't expect this round of guard duty to last that long. Well, Titu's finally back, at least...
Traveler: Hey there! Who are you?
Yukom: Haha, me? You're a curious guest. Call me Yukom. As you can see, I'm a guard at this sentry post — one of them, anyway.
Yukom: #But word to the wise, brother — you probably shouldn't just walk up to and talk to someone in the wilds here like that...
Yukom: This is the outer edge of the Children of Echoes' lands. Once you leave this area, you'll enter territory where any warrior's fair game to spar.
Traveler: What are you doing here, exactly?
Yukom: Oh, you know, guarding, standing... waiting.
Yukom: Alright, so I'm a little bored, and a bit tired, too. This is the Children of Echoes' sentry post, which people take turns to stand guard over every day.
Yukom: This is my "duty" within the tribe.
Traveler: Titu's back. Not gonna take a break?
Yukom: What does it look like I'm doing, eh? And now that he is, I no longer need to stare at those ominous winds, strange mutterings, and twisting shadows.
Yukom: #Just need to watch others work — that's the best kinda rest, brother!
Traveler: See you!
Yukom: Aye, see you. Take care!
