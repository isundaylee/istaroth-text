# Talk Dialog

Tetsunosuke: We... We're almost rid of them...
Kujou Sara: ...That's enough! I will not fail the Shogun again because of you!
Ginkaku: EH!!! A tengu!
Kinkaku: Tengu was flying... Tengu is a cheater!
Kujou Sara: Surrender now, and I will spare your life.
Tetsunosuke: Tengu... Why are you helping the humans! Tengu is a youkai!
Kujou Sara: *scoff*... My loyalty is to the Shogun. Humans and youkai are no different in my eyes.
Ginkaku: Shogun... That's the leader of the humans!
Kinkaku: ...Shogun sent people to steal our land... Shogun is bad!
Kujou Sara: Nonsense! The Shogun would never give such an order!
Ei: Calm yourself, Sara. Let's hear them out.
Tetsunosuke: Shogun... sent humans to steal our home...
Kinkaku: And the Mikawa Flower Festival! Shogun is making youkai serve the humans...!
Paimon: Serve the humans? He's not talking about the game development, is he...?
Ginkaku: *whimper*... Shogun even forced great baku youkai to work all night...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Oh... you mean yesterday? That was my choice, actually...
Paimon: Geez, where are these ideas coming from?
Traveler: I think there are some misunderstandings...
Ginkaku: S—Stay back!
Kinkaku: Humans want to enslave us again!
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Hold on, something's not right! We should try a different approach...
Ei: No need... I know what's wrong. They're trapped in a nightmare.
Tetsunosuke: What are you doing...!? Trying to put Tetsunosuke to work!?
Ginkaku: G—Ginkaku... doesn't wanna stay up all night... *whimper*...
Ei: Servitude, enslavement... These might sound like ridiculous misunderstandings to us. But, that is their reality right now.
Ei: ...A world of despair and fear, where enemies lurk at every turn... devoid of even a single shred of light.
Paimon: So, they're... sleepwalking? How do we wake them up?
Yae Miko: ...If we knew how, we would have done so back then.
Kinkaku: G—Give us your worst! Kinkaku will never leave the Tanuki path! Kinkaku... Kinkaku will die before serving you!
Traveler: ...I may have a solution.
Ei: ...Truly?
Traveler: If the nightmares come from the Abyss...
Ginkaku: Wh—What are you doing...!? No... Don't!
Tetsunosuke: ...The humans are everywhere. We can't hide forever...
Kinkaku: How long have we been hiding? One hundred years? Five hundred years?
Ginkaku: No idea... If Ioroi was still around, he would remember...
Kinkaku: Quiet! Someone's coming!
Kaga: ...This is a fine piece of land! The grain yield should be exceptional.
Kiritani: Remember to check for traces of youkai in the surrounding area. By order of the Shogun...
Kiritani: ...By order of the Shogun, we are to exterminate all youkai that cross our path!
Mizukawa: Hah, why so hasty? We should leave some alive. We can make them work their own land, haha!
Kaga: Hey, you know about the Mikawa Flower Festival, right? I heard fifty percent of the profit is going to the development fund!
Mizukawa: Oh, yeah! The festival for humans and...
Mizukawa: ...The festival for humans and humans alone! Heh, the youkai have had their fun. It's our turn, now!
Kaga: That's right! We should put them to work! They're known for their transformations, right? Heh, then the little monkeys can dance for us until they die, haha...
Tetsunosuke: N—No... How could they do that...
Ginkaku: Quiet! O—Or they'll catch us...
Kiritani: Hahahahaha!
Nightmare Fragments (???): ...Heh...
Kaga: What... What is that!? Argh!
Hitotsume Kozou: Hey... Are you alright? Youko! Kappa! I need help over here!
Kappa: Hold on, we're coming... Arghhh!
Nightmare Fragments (???): ...Heh...
Ginkaku: The youkai... and the humans... are unconscious?
Kinkaku: The same thing happened... to all of them?
Hitotsume Kozou: ...The Mikawa Flower Festival...
Tetsunosuke: This youkai... can speak!
Youko: No... If we don't make it to the Mikawa Flower Festival... Boss Thoma will be so upset...
Youko: ...Boss Thoma... will eat us...
Tetsunosuke: EEEK!!!
Ginkaku: The humans are coming for us... We're gonna lose our home... Wh—What do we do?
Kinkaku: W—We infiltrate the Mikawa Flower Festival! We scare the humans away... Then, they won't come!
Tetsunosuke: But, how do we get into the festival...?
Kappa: Boss Thoma... is the best...
Kinkaku: How about... we turn into those three youkai...
Traveler: (These memories... They belong to the bake-danuki...?)
Paimon: #Traveler! Traveler!
Ei: #...Are you alright, Traveler?
Traveler: ...I'm fine.
Tetsunosuke: Uh... Wh—Where are we...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Huh? The nightmare is gone! You... purified it?
Traveler: Just my way of dealing with the Abyss.
Ginkaku: Eek! H—Humans! And a bunch of youkai!
Kinkaku: The Mikawa Flower Festival! The humans are gonna... They're gonna... What were they gonna do?
Shikanoin Heizou: Looks like they're confused... They still seem wary of humans...
Traveler: That might have something to do with a long time in hiding...
Shikanoin Heizou: ...Hiding?
Black Screen Text: You describe the memories to the group...
Paimon: Oh... That explains all the "Boss Thoma" this, and "Boss Thoma" that. That was the only thing they could imitate...
Paimon: Wait a second, Hitotsume Kozou and the others should be Akitsu Yuugei experts. But, this time, Thoma did all the work! Paimon can't believe we missed something so suspicious!
Traveler: You're like Heizou, if his skills only worked in hindsight...
Paimon: Oh, you're saying Paimon's deductive reasoning is Heizou level!
Shikanoin Heizou: Heh, more or less.
Yae Miko: #Based on your description, Traveler, it's possible these bake-danuki have been in hiding for five hundred years... Sounds like they know Ioroi, too. Why don't we ask him? He's not far.
Ei: The Protector of the Grove... It's been five hundred years since our last meeting. Sara, Heizou, return to the festival to keep watch.
Ei: The Doppelganger incident has been resolved, but the threat of the Nightmare remains. I will handle the meeting with Ioroi myself.
Shikanoin Heizou (Shikanoin Heizou & Kujou Sara): Yes, Shogun!
Kujou Sara (Shikanoin Heizou & Kujou Sara): Yes, Shogun!
Traveler: There's something I can try...
Traveler: Kichiboushi and the others weren't forced into anything...
