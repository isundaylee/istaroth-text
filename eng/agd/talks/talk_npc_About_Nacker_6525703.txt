Traveler: About Nacker...
Raimondo: The Institute has already opened up investigations matters concerning Mr. Nacker, and has dispatched several special investigators. However, we have not yet found any useful leads.
Raimondo: Hmph... Personally, I sincerely hope that both Mr. Nacker and the Arkhium Kinetic Core were both blown to pieces.
Raimondo: ...Although I am also painfully aware that the Fontaine Research Institute is unlikely to be that fortunate.
