Traveler: Message from "Ramen Buddy"
Observe Sign-In Board: Well, well, Sir Arataki, I didn't think you'd remember little old me, your ramen buddy. I've since spent many nights considering how I might express my thanks.
Observe Sign-In Board: See that standing sign over there? Yes, that's right, it's your beloved Ms. Hina. It was a last-minute decision, and I spent quite a hefty sum on this one.
Observe Sign-In Board: You wouldn't disappoint me by not placing it in the most conspicuous of locations, such that Ms. Hina might be put on full display to the people of Watatsumi Island in all her glory, would you?
