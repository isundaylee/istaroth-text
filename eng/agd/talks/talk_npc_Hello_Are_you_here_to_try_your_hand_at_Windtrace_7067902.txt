Gygax: Hello! Are you here to try your hand at Windtrace?
Traveler: I'll give it a try.
Gygax: Sure! This way, please...
Traveler: So, I heard Windtrace has some new rules?
Gygax: Ah yes, let me tell you about that. I've added some cool new stuff!
Gygax: I've introduced something called a Signaling Device in this brand-new version of Windtrace.
Gygax: As long as the Rebels can activate 4 such Devices, they'll defeat the Hunter and emerge victorious!
Gygax: Whereas the Hunter... Well, nothing's changed there! If they manage to capture all the Rebels, they win.
Gygax: But in this version of Windtrace, when Rebels get caught by the Hunter, they won't be knocked out straight away. Instead, they'll be kept in what's known as the "Surveillance Zone."
Gygax: After waiting a bit, or with the help of other Rebels, they can escape from the Surveillance Zone and carry on playing.
Gygax: But if a Rebel who's previously been caught gets captured a second time... they'll be knocked out of the game completely.
Gygax: So you see, the rules are actually very simple. You'll get the hang of it once you've played a few times.
Gygax: So come try out this brand-new version of Windtrace!
Traveler: Not right now.
Gygax: No worries. Come back when you're free â€” I'll be here for a while yet.
