Paimon: The words on these pages... Ugh, this writing's so blurred, Paimon can't make out what it says.
Paimon: Huh? Wait, is this the "mysterious ink bottle" that Wolfy mentioned?
Traveler: Looks like a perfectly normal ink bottle to me...
Paimon: Hmm, that's true... Maybe Paimon's overthinking this. After all, you wouldn't usually find mysterious magical items like that just lying around, would you?
Paimon: #Anyway, doesn't seem like there's anything worth looking at here. Let's go, Traveler.
Traveler: Let me have a quick taste...
Paimon: Dâ€”Don't do that! What else could ink taste like anyway!?
