# Time and Wind


## Talk 1

Ravaged Carving: "Stories brought on the wind will bloom into legends in due time."
Paimon: What does this even mean? ...Paimon has no idea.
Paimon: Still, this place looks like it hides some secret...
Paimon: Let's check this area out. We might find some clues!

## Talk 2

Ravaged Carving: "Stories brought on the wind will bloom into legends in due time."
Paimon: This must be the sundial mentioned in the notebook!
Paimon: Paimon doesn't get what's special about it, though...
Paimon: Maybe we should read that notebook a bit more carefully.

## Talk 3

Henry Morton: Hmm? Did you have some business here, Traveler?
Traveler: About the Eye of the Storm...
Henry Morton: An Eye of the Storm? I've been in this area this entire time, and I've never seen such a thing, except for that sudden huge gust wind earlier...
Henry Morton: But I'm sure that it wasn't an Eye of the Storm. I would recognize one of those things anywhere.
Traveler: Alright then...
Henry Morton: Believe me, I wouldn't be able to forget something like that coming to interrupt my research even if I tried.
Henry Morton: To be precise, I'm doing research together with a friend of mine.
Henry Morton: He's also a scholar, and we went to Sumeru Akademiya together.
Henry Morton: He became an archaeologist thereafter, traveling the world and doing surveys, while I continued my studies in the Akademiya.
Henry Morton: When he came to Mondstadt, he told me excitedly that he was surveying the Thousand Winds Temple.
Henry Morton: He even said something like: "Once I've uncovered the secrets of your homeland, you're the first person I'll tell."
Henry Morton: I didn't hear from him afterwards. I asked someone to send Cyrus a letter, requesting that the Adventurers' Guild help me look for my friend's whereabouts.
Henry Morton: But there was no news of him at all, and so I discontinued my studies and hurried back here.
Henry Morton: But there's nothing here but a sundial, and there are no other clues...
Traveler: Well, there's a sundial on that island...
Henry Morton: What? There's another sundial elsewhere that's identical to this one, and it's on an island?
Henry Morton: Oh, yes! Now I remember. I've actually seen that island sometimes, when the weather's clear.
Henry Morton: Wait... You said that you found a notebook next to the sundial? Had my friend perhaps been there...?
Henry Morton: Thank you. If I have the chance, I will head to that island to have a look. For now, however, I still have to figure this place out.
Henry Morton: I must continue my research. If you're interested, you can have a look at my research notes. I've left them over there.
Henry Morton: Who knows? Perhaps there's something in there that might help you.
Traveler: What are you up to here?
Henry Morton: Me? I'm doing a bit of research.

## Talk 4

Ravaged Carving: "Stories brought on the wind will bloom into legends in due time."

## Talk 5

Ravaged Carving: "Stories brought on the wind will bloom into legends in due time."

## Talk 6

Henry Morton: Where did this thing come from? It wasn't here before!
Henry Morton: How did you summon it?
Traveler: Well...
Henry Morton: Ah, so that's "time and wind..."
Henry Morton: So, there's another sundial exactly like this one on the island, am I right?
Henry Morton: And the method to solve its riddle is the same? Then there must be some link between these two sundials, and the two places they are located in.
Henry Morton: I must find a way to get to that island, and quickly...
Henry Morton: Thank you, Traveler. Once I've made some preparations, I will look for you, and we shall visit that uninhabited island together.

## Talk 7

Henry Morton: Time and wind... Just what did he find?
Traveler: Time and wind?
Henry Morton: Oh, that's something that my friend mentioned in the very last letter that he sent me.
Henry Morton: He said that "time and wind" hide one of Mondstadt's secrets.
Henry Morton: However, I've never heard that phrase before, and I'm from around these parts. Who knows where he heard that...
Traveler: You studied in Sumeru?
Henry Morton: I did. Though I'm from Mondstadt, I've always been studying at the Sumeru Akademiya. I've probably spent more time there than I have in Mondstadt.
Henry Morton: You want to know what happens in there? Well, it's not a secret, so... Hmm, how should I put it?
Henry Morton: They're a bunch of weird people. Hmm, perhaps that's too disrespectful... I guess they're "people who make quite the impression?"
Henry Morton: If you ever have the chance to go, you'll see what I mean. But just stick to having a look. You don't want to stay too long.
