# Margaret's Longing


## Talk 1

Venti: ...So, yours is the cat that went missing.
Paimon: Venti! Have you come to help?
Venti: Me, here to help you? Why, on the contrary, it is I who needs helping!
Paimon: But Paimon just saw you talking to Margaret about Prince...
Venti: Aha! So, Prince is the name of the feline fiend who thieved my spare *astral iron strings*!
Venti: Though it gladdens my heart to see that the free-spirited ethos of Mondstadt is alive and well in creatures great and small... Still, it's a bit audacious!
Traveler: Spoken just like a parent who chooses to spoil said rascal!
Margaret: Haha, Prince is a mischievous little rascal alright!
Paimon: Indeed. Just like Barbatos...
Venti: Ahaha, yes, quite... quite... Ahem! Now, let's see about getting ourselves an audience with his little highness, Prince Rascal of Mondstadt!
Venti: I have a performance tonight, and without my spare strings, I shall have to disappoint my audience.
Paimon: What would a kitty cat want with lyre strings anyway?
Margaret: Everyone knows cats go crazy for a ball of string!
Paimon: What!?
Venti: These lyre strings are made of astral iron, which contains Anemo energy. That makes them extremely durable, so I normally just roll them up in a ball to make them easier to carry.
Venti: That's a trick of the trade from a traveling bard!
Paimon: The strings contain Anemo energy?
Paimon: #That'll help us! Traveler, it's time for you to use your *Elemental Sight* again!
Paimon: Paimon's sure there must be some elemental footprints or something.
Margaret: Thank you all. Prince should be somewhere around the Marketplace. It's a black cat you're looking for.
Margaret: Oh— Take this *fish*, it's little Prince's favorite food. Maybe it will help you find him.

## Talk 2

Margaret: Where have you been looking?
Margaret: Prince should be somewhere around the Marketplace. Remember, he's got black fur.

## Talk 3

Kitten: Meow!

## Talk 4

Margaret: Prince should be somewhere around the Marketplace. Remember, he's got black fur.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Wow, Prince has very keen senses. It didn't take much to scare him off.
Paimon: See if you can approach him crouching *from behind*. That way, your footsteps will be quieter.
Paimon: It must be difficult not being able to float, hee-hee.
Paimon: If you're anxious to find Prince, why not coax him to you with some *Fish*? Kitty cats do love eating fish.
Paimon: If you've run out of *Fish*, go grab some more from the lake. Now, back to it!

## Talk 6

Paimon: Drat! He's run off again.
Paimon: But where is he going? Hmm, Paimon wonders if...

## Talk 7

Margaret: Prince! Good boy, that's my Prince, I knew you'd come home to me...
Paimon: *panting* Gah! After all that searching...
Margaret: Oh Princey, how could you leave me like that...
Paimon: Looks like those two need some time to themselves...
Venti: Look at you... Did Prince take you on a bit of a wild goose chase, then?
Venti: Heh... Cheer up, even if you didn't catch him, he's back here thanks to you.
Venti: And he still has the astral iron strings with him!
Venti: I daresay that a private performance played using these very same strings would not be an excessive way to show my gratitude! ...Ah, ah...
Paimon: Ah what?
Venti: ACHOO!
Venti: *cough* Haha... Apologies. At this distance, my cat allergy seems to be rearing its head...
Paimon: Oh, now Paimon gets why you didn't go looking for your strings by yourself...
Venti: Hehe, anyway, thanks for the help, I'll be going now— a—achoo!

## Talk 8

Margaret: Prince! Where did you go running off to? Thank goodness you're safe...
Paimon: He made sure we had our work cut out for us looking for him.
Margaret: Oh Princey, how could you leave me like that...
Paimon: Looks like those two need some time to themselves...
Paimon: And here are your astral iron strings, Venti.
Venti: You found them! Wonderful! I was not optimistic they would turn up.
Venti: I daresay that a private performance played using these very same strings would not be an excessive way to show my gratitude! ...Ah, ah...
Paimon: Ah what?
Venti: ACHOO!
Venti: *cough* Haha... Apologies. At this distance, my cat allergy seems to be rearing its head...
Paimon: Oh, now Paimon gets why you didn't go looking for your strings by yourself...
Venti: Hehe, anyway, thanks for the help, I'll be going now— a—achoo!
