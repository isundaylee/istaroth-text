Traveler: Sounds like your job is the toughest!
Ferdinand: Heh, it's the Hydro Eidolons that are really doing the heavy-lifting for us. Besides, if you want to make a new track, someone's gotta work hard for it.
Ferdinand: ...*ahem* Feels like I'm complaining. Nope, no more of that.
Ferdinand: The carts and rails are designed for first and foremost to make people happy. Passengers having fun is the only thing that matters.
Ferdinand: If passengers heard my complaining, they might feel bad riding the carts! That wouldn't be fun for them, haha!
