Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "New dining option in the miner's cafeteria available this week!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Combining the Jueyun Chilis from Liyue cuisine with Blazed Meat Stew, it has a fiery texture and colors bright as paint that'll give the fire in your bellies all the fuel it needs!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Still, all mining crew members are encouraged to only try this new dish after work, as you may need to consume inordinate amounts of water, which may be detrimental to mining work."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Spicy? Yesss, that's what I'm talking about! The Fonta-flavored Grainfruit Meat Soup Cempoa invented last time was pretty good, nice and sweet, but it wasn't very filling..."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Thanks for you support! As for the Fonta-flavored Grainfruit Meat Soup, in light of the various different kinds of feedback received, the chefs will continue to modify and improve the dish and offer it from time to time as a specialty!"
