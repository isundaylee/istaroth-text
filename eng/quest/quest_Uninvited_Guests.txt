# Uninvited Guests


## Talk 1

Huai'an: Agh, I must think of something...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Huai'an: Ah, it's you. *sigh* I'd rather not talk about it.
Huai'an: Lately, business at the inn has been getting better and better, and we've had more people coming to stay.
Huai'an: Some people are looking for a peaceful time alone, while others bring their families over on trips.
Huai'an: The booming business is a good thing, of course, but the fact remains that many monsters roam the nearby areas.
Huai'an: If some child out at play or senior folk out on a stroll were to run into those creatures...
Huai'an: To prevent such incidents from occurring, I have to go out and chase monsters around the inn away.
Huai'an: But I am just one man, and they are many...
Huai'an: Traveler, could you lend me a hand? You will be well-paid, I assure you!
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Huai'an: I'm counting on you, in any case. I noticed that there were various monster encampments about with dangerous creatures within them.
Huai'an: Also, another group of monsters tiptoed up near the inn and even set up camp there...
Huai'an: Ugh...
Huai'an: You know what? You can leave the more dangerous ones to me. Just help me to clear out the monsters surrounding the inn.
Huai'an: We'll meet up back here once all the monsters have been driven out.
Huai'an: *sigh* These monsters really are a problem...
Traveler: I mean, you're pretty good yourself, aren't you?
Huai'an: Me? Well... Thank you for the praise, but I'm just passable.
Huai'an: And even so, I cannot fight them all by myself.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Huh, not a single clue in sight. Who defeated all these monsters? Was it... another adventurer?
Paimon: Hmm...
Paimon: But since these monsters have been defeated, let's just go back to Huai'an and tell him the news.

## Talk 3

Xiao: ...Oh, it's you.
Traveler: What brings you here?
Xiao: I encountered these monsters by chance and defeated them.
Xiao: This area is not safe. So...
Traveler: I'll be careful.
Xiao: Right. I have other matters to attend to. See you.
Traveler: Those monsters...

## Talk 4

Huai'an: You're back. Agh, those monsters were really hard to deal with...
Traveler: You beat them all?
Huai'an: Hahaha, that's right. It took quite a lot of work, you know? Ah, I'm just not the young fighter I used to be.
Huai'an: I suppose you've defeated the ones on your end as well, eh?
Traveler: About the monster camp...
Huai'an: They were all defeated... But there was not a soul in the camp?
Huai'an: That's very strange. Did some passing adventurer defeat them?
Huai'an: Whatever the case, thanks for patrolling the area on my behalf. Please take these.

## Talk 5

Huai'an: I suppose you've defeated the ones on your end as well, eh?
Traveler: About Xiao...
Huai'an: So he did it? But why would he...
Huai'an: Eh. I'm not going to second-guess him.
Huai'an: Whatever the case, thanks for patrolling the area on my behalf. Please take these.
