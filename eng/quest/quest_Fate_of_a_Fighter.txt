# Fate of a Fighter


## Talk 1

Inaba Kyuuzou: An outlander? Interesting...
Inaba Kyuuzou: If you're a tourist, you've come to the wrong place.
Traveler: What are you doing here?
Inaba Kyuuzou: What, are you from the Shogunate?
Traveler: No.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Then mind your own business.
Paimon: This guy's so rude!
Traveler: The Shogunate sent me, alright.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Why you outlanders...
Inaba Kyuuzou: In front of the Commissioner, you beg like dogs, but in front of us Inazuman samurai, you act all high and mighty...
Inaba Kyuuzou: Running here, spying there, stirring things up everywhere... And now you come all the way to this broken boat, for archons only know what.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Well, too bad. I'm just a wounded soldier. There's nothing I can do for you.
Inaba Kyuuzou: So if it pleases you, kindly get out of here.
Paimon: Doesn't this guy have any manners at all?
Inaba Kyuuzou: Whatever. You're too noisy.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Before you leave, let me give you a piece of advice: don't stay on Yashiori Island for too long. This island has been cursed.
Traveler: Cursed?
Inaba Kyuuzou: What are you, deaf? I said that this island is cursed.
Inaba Kyuuzou: This never-ending stalemate, the ambitions of our lords, the despair of the common folk, the hatred welling up from the innocent victims, the charnel-sick of vulneraries filling the rooms of dying old people...
Inaba Kyuuzou: It's all a curse.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Leave before you get crushed under its weight.
Paimon: Paimon didn't get him at all. What a weirdo.

## Talk 2

Inaba Kyuuzou: Hmph, how humiliating...
Paimon: Hey! We saved your life! What do you mean we're "humiliating"?
Traveler: He's talking about himself, Paimon...
Inaba Kyuuzou: To think that I had to be rescued by outlanders, and was even reduced to being judged by them...
Paimon: Oh... So, Mr. Samurai, are you alright?
Inaba Kyuuzou: ...
Traveler: Well, he seems alright, at least.
Inaba Kyuuzou: I am in your debt, outlander.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Also, you fought commendably.
Traveler: #I'm {NICKNAME}. Pleased to meet you.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Don't look down your nose at me, outlander.
Inaba Kyuuzou: ...Inaba Tousaburou Kyuuzou. Just call me Kyuuzou.
Traveler: So, who were those people?
Inaba Kyuuzou: They're pirates. They have many strongholds around Nazuchi Beach.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Thugs, out-of-work miners and fishermen, fugitives running from the Vision Hunt Decree, deserters from both sides of the war... Sometimes, they gather into groups and degenerate into bandits and pirates. They try, in vain, to escape the control of Her Excellency.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Whether you call them Vagrants or Kairagi, they are all lawless thugs... We had been suppressing them for a while until the rebels destroyed the ward on the island...
Inaba Kyuuzou: The refugees from Tatarasuna and the mine fled in quick succession, and some of those rats scurried off to this place, swelling the ranks of these pirate gangs and making them more reckless.
Inaba Kyuuzou: That group of pirates just now came from the camp in the south, and they had their eyes on the cargo onboard.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Unfortunately for them, I ruined their plans... Hehe...
Traveler: So this isn't your ship, then?
Inaba Kyuuzou: This thing? It belonged to the Sangonomiya rebels. I am not so sure myself... Either way, when I came, it was already deserted.
Inaba Kyuuzou: So I've stayed and lived in it like a hermit crab till now.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Hah, it's been a long time since I spoke so much. How exhausting...
Inaba Kyuuzou: If you do not mind, I will need your help with something. Once my wound has healed, I will surely return the favor I owe...
Inaba Kyuuzou: I need you to help me clear out the nearby pirate camp that I mentioned earlier.
Inaba Kyuuzou: That's the only way to stop them from coming back here and bothering me like a pack of stray dogs. It might even send the other pirate camps a message, so they don't get any ideas.
Inaba Kyuuzou: It'll also let me see what you can do. How about it?
Traveler: Piece of cake.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Hmph. It seems you are fond of talking big...
Inaba Kyuuzou: By the way, outlander...
Inaba Kyuuzou: Don't get too conceited. Miss a step, and you might break your leg.
Traveler: Be right back.
Traveler: Why were you attacked?
Traveler: Well, his pride is certainly hurt.
Traveler: This is something unique to samurai...

## Talk 3

Inaba Kyuuzou: I'm tired. Please forgive my lack of hospitality.

## Talk 4

Inaba Kyuuzou: You've returned.
Traveler: Cleaned them up.
Paimon: Huh, the atmosphere got weird all of a sudden...
Inaba Kyuuzou: I must apologize for asking you, an outsider, to do my dirty work.
Traveler: You're being a lot more polite than when we first met.
Inaba Kyuuzou: ...
Inaba Kyuuzou: I've used up all the medicinal herbs I had.
Inaba Kyuuzou: I have run out of herbs to dress my wound, but it is still quite inflamed...
Inaba Kyuuzou: But please... You needn't worry about me. I can hold on.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Take care of your own business, go.
Traveler: You're such a kid.
Inaba Kyuuzou: ...?
Inaba Kyuuzou: What did you say?
Paimon: We're talking about you. You're acting like a child.
Paimon: You're clearly in a really bad way, and you look like you're about to cry for help, but still, you're acting like a tough guy... You're not honest at all!
Paimon: Only kids do that.
Paimon: And don't forget, Mr. Kyuuzou.
Traveler: You still owe us.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Hmph... you two...
Inaba Kyuuzou: In that case, please find some Naku weed for me. It can be found everywhere on this island. Full leaves are the best, the liquid can be squeezed out and applied to the wound to reduce inflammation...
Inaba Kyuuzou: That's all. I'm going to take a nap now, so leave me alone.
Traveler: We're here to help.
Traveler: Is your wound better?
Traveler: You should have peace and quiet for a while.

## Talk 5

Inaba Kyuuzou: It's you again!?
Inaba Kyuuzou: Didn't I tell you to... Oh, forget it. Do as you like.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Just don't mess around with my things. There are just enough supplies on the ship for you. Leave as soon as you are satisfied.
Traveler: Would you like some help?
Inaba Kyuuzou: No. Can't you see that I'm doing just fine?
Traveler: But your wound...
Inaba Kyuuzou: It's my wound, not yours.
Paimon: Hey, we asked out of kindness!
Inaba Kyuuzou: Then I also answer you out of kindness: don't bother me.
Traveler: I can help you.
Inaba Kyuuzou: How can you help me, hand me over to the shogunate?
Inaba Kyuuzou: Haha, I'd advise you against such misguided mercy... I will be treated as a deserter, and Lord Kujou has never shown mercy to deserters.
Inaba Kyuuzou: If you really want to help me, then give me some peace and quiet.
Paimon: Wow, this guy is so grumpy!

## Talk 6

Inaba Kyuuzou: You're back. Stay safe while you're on this island.
Traveler: Will these be enough?

## Talk 7

Inaba Kyuuzou: It will take a long time to mash the herbs into a paste. You can go now.
Inaba Kyuuzou: No, don't get me wrong. I'm not driving you away...
Inaba Kyuuzou: Come back after a while. It's good to have someone to chat with.
Traveler: I understand.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Take care, outlander.
Traveler: Take care of your wounds.

## Talk 8

Inaba Kyuuzou: Outlander, how have you been?
Inaba Kyuuzou: I apologize. This is no place for guests.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Still... I'm glad you could come.
Traveler: You look much better now.
Inaba Kyuuzou: All thanks to you. Once again, I am in your debt.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Haha, isn't it a pity that I've survived yet again?
Paimon: Isn't that a good thing? Why's that a pity?
Traveler: What's next for you?
Inaba Kyuuzou: I haven't made my mind up about what to do next, but I don't think I'll go back.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Kujou Masahito is not a bad person, but his old man is calling for deserters to be caught and punished...
Inaba Kyuuzou: I cannot afford to get on the wrong side of him.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Maybe I'll take off my armor. It's been nice, living alone here...
Inaba Kyuuzou: But until we have peace, there's no point deceiving myself. My memories assert that I am still that same wounded, bloodstained soldier...
Inaba Kyuuzou: *sigh* And who knows what might happen in the future?
Traveler: ...
Inaba Kyuuzou: Well, as I was saying, I had never doubted the decisions of Her Excellency, so I think that even if I died, I would die with no regrets, right?
Paimon: Well, this conversation suddenly got heavy...
Inaba Kyuuzou: Ah, speaking of which, it's time for me to visit my old comrades in arms, who are still with me on this island.
Inaba Kyuuzou: In Inazuma's tradition, we offer our fallen comrades a Dendrobium, a delicate and noble flower... A symbol of the fate of all samurai.
Inaba Kyuuzou: By the way, if you meet my old comrades in arms in your journey, please stop for a moment and get to know them.
Traveler: ... ...
Traveler: Have you ever thought about going back?

## Talk 9

Inaba Kyuuzou: ...And it seems that the rats nearby have begun scurrying about again.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Watch out for pirates if you wander around these parts, outlander.
Traveler: Thank you.
Inaba Kyuuzou: You're welcome.
Traveler: They shall be no match for me.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Haha, again with the big talk...
Inaba Kyuuzou: Only say that once you've finally gotten rid of them all!
Traveler: You have a deal.
Inaba Kyuuzou: Yes, that we do.
