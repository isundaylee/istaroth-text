Traveler: It's great.
Linling: Hehe, I see you have good taste. My poems can set the mood even for an event as grand as the Lantern Rite.
Linling: *sigh* It's a shame that those who truly grasp the subtleties of verse and rhyme are few and far between.
Linling: I once posted my poems all around Liyue Harbor to help bring the spirit of Lantern Rite to the citizens of Liyue.
Linling: ...But before long, I was reported by the Millelith and was told that I would be arrested if I dared to post my poetry again.
Linling: Hmph, those uncultured curs, have they no taste at all!?
