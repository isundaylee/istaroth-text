# Cold Case Commission


## Talk 1

Paimon: We made it to Vimara Village! Why don't we talk to some of the villagers to learn a bit more about the missing guy?
Paimon: If this commission is really as challenging as Katheryne made it out to be, we're gonna need to carry out a very detailed investigation!

## Talk 2

Bahram: I really hope he's okay. Please, we're counting on you to find him.

## Talk 3

Bahram: Hello there! You looking to buy something? I do business in this area...
Paimon: Oh, no, no. We're adventurers! Katheryne sent us to look into a commission here in Vimara Village...
Bahram: Ah, so you're here about that, then... *sigh* You're not the first, that's for sure. We've certainly made a lot of trouble for you all.
Bahram: To be honest, we aren't holding out much hope. Many adventurers have made their way out here, confident they'd be able to help us, only to leave soon after with nothing to show for their efforts.
Bahram: We've pretty much had it up to here in questions, and the area around the village has practically been overturned in search of clues. But, no one has been able to make any headway...
Paimon: So this person we're looking for... What's his name? Where did he live? Does he have any relatives?
Bahram: I don't know. I really have no clue. I couldn't tell you.
Paimon: Okaayy... Guess you really are sick of answering questions.
Bahram: Ah... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sound short with you. I was actually just giving you my answer to your questions.
Traveler: So those three questions are a no go, then...
Bahram: I know it may seem like we don't have anything to offer by way of information, but I promise you we all have a very strong impression of him. When you live in the same village as someone, you develop a lot of memories together, y'know?
Bahram: We just don't know the specifics. Maybe we did at one point, but that information is long gone by now...
Bahram: At least, that's what everyone in the village seems to think. We've all exchanged what we know, and that was the only logical conclusion.
Paimon: Alright, specifics aside, then... What kind of person was he?
Bahram: Young guy, in his early twenties probably. Incredibly kind sort of person, always willing to lend a helping hand...
Bahram: I'd chat with him when I didn't have any customers. I even saw him stick out his neck for others on more than one occasion, haha... Very interesting guy, that one.
Paimon: Now that you've started talking about him, you don't seem nearly as down in the dumps as you did before. Seems like he left a pretty good impression on you.
Bahram: But of course! Everyone in the village is pretty fond of him. We wouldn't have issued that commission otherwise.
Bahram: There aren't many young people like him nowadays, so genuine and pure. To think that he just up and disappeared one day... I just hope nothing bad happened...
Paimon: Could he have just... moved away without telling anyone?
Bahram: No. He's not the type to leave without saying goodbye. And anyway, moving away without being seen by a single person in the village? There's no way he would've been able to manage that...
Paimon: Huh... All right. Thanks for the information! We're gonna go ask around some more.
Traveler: Is there anything else you can tell us?

## Talk 4

Amadhiah: Is that guests I hear?
Paimon: Hi, Grandpa Amadhiah! We're here to help you look for the guy that's gone missing.
Amadhiah: Ah, so that's what brings you to these parts! Coming all this way for our sake... That's so very kind of you. With your help, I trust that young man's case is in good hands.
Paimon: Could you tell us a bit about him?
Amadhiah: Of course! I'm happy to help any way I can.
Amadhiah: With my failing eyesight, I'm afraid I can't offer much about his appearance. But, I do remember hearing the sound of his voice... Not recently, of course. That loss has left me feeling quite empty.
Amadhiah: I don't think his parents are still living in the village. But, somehow, he never seemed lonely. In fact, he was usually the one offering companionship to others.
Amadhiah: He would often take time to visit the elderly or play with the orphans in the village.
Amadhiah: And whenever someone had something on their mind, he was there to listen with open ears. He always knew just what to say.
Amadhiah: As the village chief, I owe him many thanks. Helping villagers navigate difficult moments in their lives should have been one of my responsibilities, but he was often the one rising to the occasion.
Paimon: Wow, he seems like such a nice and gentle person! No wonder his disappearance affected you all so much.
Paimon: But, um... You wouldn't happen to know any details about his name, address, or family situation, right?
Amadhiah: *sigh*... I'm ashamed to admit it, but... I just can't remember. No matter how you look at it, I should know those things, but for some reason, no matter how hard I try to remember, the information just doesn't come. Perhaps my age really has caught up with me this time...
Paimon: Ah... It's okay! There's no need to force yourself to try and remember. We'll figure something out...
Paimon: #Well, {NICKNAME}? What do you think?
Traveler: There's probably more to this case than meets the eye.
Paimon: Paimon thinks so too! Like the name thing... It's so weird that no one remembers his name.
Paimon: And nobody has been able to tell us anything about his family or where he lived... It's like this guy's been erased from reality or something.
Traveler: I would say it's more like...
Paimon: Wait... So you're saying, it's not that he's been "erased" necessarily, but more like he never "existed" to begin with?
Paimon: Okay, Paimon's gonna need some time to process that one... Someone who only exists in people's memories...
Traveler: (Could it be like what happened with Greater Lord Rukkhadevata? Like some sort of mass alteration of people's memories...?)
Atossa: You two are the adventurers who just arrived, right? You're here for the Vimara Village commission?
Paimon: Yep, sure are! We were just looking into the case...
Atossa: I'm so glad to hear that! Thank goodness you haven't given up. I've been so worried the Adventurers' Guild might cancel our commission...
Atossa: My name is Atossa, by the way. I grew up here in Vimara Village. Anyway, I just wanted to say... Please keep searching for our missing villager. I'm begging you. You have to find him...
Traveler: I'm sure we'll track him down.
Paimon: Yeah! No need to worry! We'll give it our best shot! So, were you close to the missing villager? Are there any leads you can give us?
Atossa: Hmm... I'm not sure this counts as a lead, but follow me. There's a place I'd like to show you.
Traveler: We'll certainly try our best.
Traveler: He's someone who only exists in people's memories.
Traveler: A lot of things are not adding up.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Is this the place? Under this tree?
Atossa: Yep. I know it doesn't look like much, but this place is very meaningful to me. It's so full of memories...
Atossa: We used to always sit together under this tree and talk. Sometimes, we would look up at the clouds in the sky, or stop to feel the wind against our skin. We could sit there for hours at a time, never realizing how long it had been...
Atossa: I was actually adopted by the people of Vimara Village. The Forest Rangers found me in the woods as a child.
Atossa: I was surrounded by such good people, and growing up in the village was so lively. Still... there were times when I couldn't help but feel incredibly alone...
Paimon: Alone?
Atossa: *sigh*... How should I put it? When something's bothering you, or when you have good news to share, you always want to talk about it with somebody. But, for the longest time, I didn't know who I could talk to, or if I should say anything at all...
Atossa: Everyone has their own problems to deal with. Even if I might want to confide in others, I don't want to become a burden.
Traveler: I think I get what you mean.
Atossa: Really? You know exactly how I feel?
Traveler: I used to have someone like that, a family member that I could talk to no matter what.
Paimon: Aww!
Atossa: Wow, that sounds really nice. You're quite lucky. When it comes to our missing villager, well... I guess you could say that, to me, he felt like both â€” a family member I could rely on, and a friend who could really understand me.
Atossa: No matter what came my way, I knew I could always talk to him...
Atossa: He was so thoughtful and pure... and patient, too. Whenever I talked to him, he would always seem so interested, as if the things I was describing were just as important to him as they were to me.
Atossa: ...Ever since he disappeared, there's been so much I wanted to tell him...
Atossa: No, no, none of those things matters now. I just really want to see him again...
Paimon: Wow, you two must have been really close...
Paimon: Did he ever tell you anything about himself?
Atossa: Hmm... He mostly just talked about interesting things he saw around the village... He'd share a lot of his own wild ideas as well...
Atossa: Oh right, I did ask him about his parents once... But, all he said was, "They're not here anymore."
Atossa: I didn't know whether that meant they had left the village or passed away, and I didn't want to pry...
Paimon: Hmm, still not much to go off of...
Atossa: Ah, look at me, talking your ear off and still nothing to show for it. I'm sorry I wasn't more help...
Traveler: Don't say that.
Atossa: The last time I talked this much in one go was when we were still together.
Atossa: Come to think of it, every time we talked, it always seemed to be around dusk, just like right now.
Atossa: Time always passed by really slowly. Even when it felt like we'd been talking for hours, the sun would still be at the same position in the sky...
Paimon: #Well, time always seems to pass slower when you're relaxed, right? ...Huh? What's wrong, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: It was always the same time of day...
Traveler: (Based on what we've learned, this is definitely not a regular missing person's case...)
Traveler: (What Atossa just told us about time could be the key to unraveling this whole mystery...)
Paimon: ...Hey, look at those Hilichurls over there... Doesn't it seem like they're acting a little strange?
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Uh, the Abyss Order. Could they be the ones behind all of this?
Paimon: Uh-oh, we've been spotted. Quick, get ready to fight!
Traveler: And time never seemed to pass...
Traveler: You helped us understand him better.
Traveler: But now, I have a lot of friends who understand me, and would be happy to hear me out.
Traveler: That's what family is for.

## Talk 6

Amadhiah: While you two are out searching, I'll also try and see what I can remember... If I think of something, I'll be sure to let you know.

## Talk 7

Atossa: Thank you so much! I wasn't expecting monsters to show up. If you hadn't been here, I'm not sure what I would've done...
Paimon: It was no trouble!
Traveler: The question we should be asking now is...
Atossa: Hmm, now that I think about it, the Hilichurls around Vimara Village have been a lot more active lately...
Atossa: They seem agitated, and would often attack anything in sight. Chief Amadhiah doesn't allow the children to play in the area around the village anymore.
Paimon: Huh... Maybe the Abyss Order really is involved...
Paimon: Well, we should head back and check out the situation in Vimara Village just in case. If the Abyss Order is plotting something, that could spell trouble for the villagers.
Traveler: What is the Abyss Order doing around here?
