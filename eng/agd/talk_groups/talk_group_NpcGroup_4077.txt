## Talk

Nevida: Hello. What can I do for you?

## Talk

Traveler: Are you working?
Nevida: Correct, the Bimarstan and neighboring areas are under my jurisdiction.
Nevida: Don't be nervous, I primarily monitor the doctors and patients, so there is no "inadvertent" breach of confidentiality.
Nevida: The Akademiya distributes information on a need-to-know basis through the Akasha Terminal, so extra leaks could cause unwanted problems.
Nevida: It would be great if you would work with our mandate and report anything unusual at once.

## Talk

Traveler: Excuse me.
Nevida: It's all right.

## Talk

Traveler: Are you working at the moment?
Nevida: That's correct. The Bimarstan and areas near it are under my jurisdiction.
Nevida: Do not fret, though. Now that Akasha has been shut down, I will no longer interfere in the exchange of knowledge between the doctors and their patients.
Nevida: What I am focusing on at present is whether dialog between doctors and patients is going smoothly, and whether medical supplies are being effectively distributed or not.
Nevida: Please cooperate with us Mahamata and make sure to report anything unusual to us at once.
