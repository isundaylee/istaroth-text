# Mt. Mushroom (For One)

Varesa's specialty. The young lady, with all the air of a bright pink marshmallow, effortlessly serves this mountainous dish with one hand. The fragrance of mushrooms, mingling with cheese, has you reaching for your cutlery before you even know it. Hey, umm... Is it even possible to finish eating this much food in a day?
