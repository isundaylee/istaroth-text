Traveler: So, tell me about this "Trove"...
Amazolli: "Idukan"... It's a good name.
Amazolli: I read it in a book of legends, but the details of the content escape me nowadays... Still, I recall that its own owner was a figure of much wisdom.
Amazolli: Wisdom comes in many forms. Printed on paper, woven upon cloth, and even spread by word of mouth.
Amazolli: And that's why I named my store after them.
