Gorou: Did I ever mention? I have a column in That's Life magazine, where I help readers with their problems.
Gorou: I only get to communicate with them in writing. But even though I never meet them face-to-face, I know that the camaraderie between us is real.
Gorou: Whatever I encounter in this domain, it's all valuable experience! I'm sure it'll come in handy one day and allow me to help more people.
