Traveler: About Sayu's Troubles
Paimon: Sayu seems to have a lot on her mind.
Paimon: Paimon can't understand why she'd have so many worries.

Paimon: Hmm, Paimon can't relate to that.
Paimon: After all, it's not Paimonly to worry too much.
Traveler: Hmmm...
Traveler: Bad news! We're almost out of Mora.
Paimon: Whâ€”What? Noooo!
Traveler: See, you're not as carefree as you thought.
Paimon: How could you prank Paimon like that...
Traveler: I guess we'll have to tighten the purse strings for the next few days...
