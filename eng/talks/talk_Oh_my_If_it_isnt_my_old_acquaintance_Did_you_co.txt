Ying'er: Oh my, if it isn't my old acquaintance. Did you come all this way during Lantern Rite just to see me?
Ying'er: It's been a while, but you still look as lovely as ever.
Ying'er: Would you be interested in trying my new fragrance?
Ying'er: You could even daub some on the kite you're flying. That way, it'll carry far and wide.
Ying'er: I imagine such a kite would make a fine decoration in your home, too.
Ying'er: It's sure to leave a lasting impression.
