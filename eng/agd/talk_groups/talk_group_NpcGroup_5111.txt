Gravier: Will my career end before it could even begin...?

## Talk

Traveler: Need help?
Gravier: Uh, I'm fine... I mean, thanks for asking, but I suspect that only I can solve this problem of mine.
Gravier: I'm a Gestionnaire, and I'm new here at the Palais Mermonia. I've been assigned to perform some simple legal work here.
Gravier: That said, though, I'm a bit of an introvert. I'm not exactly used to a job like this, where I'll need to talk to lots of people.
Gravier: Monsieur Neuvillette happened by me the other day, and seeing that I looked like I wasn't doing too well, he clapped a hand on my shoulder and gave me a few comforting words... But he just... made me even more nervous.

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry to bother you...
Gravier: Oh, don't worry, take care...

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to switch jobs?
Gravier: Thanks for the suggestion. You're a good person, just like Monsieur Neuvillette.
Gravier: I'm new here, and this is my first job, while my superior seems to have high expectations for me.
Gravier: He hopes that I will bring some youthful vigor to the rather lifeless Palais Mermonia, and I don't see myself working up the courage to refuse.
Gravier: *sigh* If only I had known, I would have switched jobs with Iaune, who only recently joined as well... He seems like a much cheerier sort than I.
