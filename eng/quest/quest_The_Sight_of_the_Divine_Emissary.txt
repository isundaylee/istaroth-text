# The Sight of the Divine Emissary


## Talk 1

Yuu: Voting results for "Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?"...
Yuu: Voting results for "The Case Files of Miss Orith"...
Yuu: ...
Yuu: I hereby announce the result of the voting, which was calculated in a transparent and fair manner.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Today's the third day of the competition. The voting results for Ayaka's outfit should be ready, right? Let's check the Bulletin Board in Inazuma City.
Paimon: Paimon wonders which outfit theme won, hehe.

## Talk 3

Mizuta: I'm terribly sorry, I was the one who mixed up the two voting boxes! By the time Mr. Onodera came back from his business trip, the results had already been announced...
Onodera: *sigh* In an effort to keep things confidential, we specifically didn't mark the ballots with the title of the poll. I regret that decision now that everything's gotten mixed up.
Paimon: No way... something did go wrong with the outfit voting.
Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler, Paimon, it seems you've also heard about the results.
Paimon: Yeah, and we're not the only ones... It felt like everyone we saw on the way here was talking about it. What are you going to do?
Onodera: Miss Kamisato, we're the ones responsible for this blunder. I'll go reorganize a vote right now and we'll set things straight.
Kamisato Ayaka: Please wait, Onodera. There might be yet another solution.
Kamisato Ayaka: The poll error is something that only the competition organizers are aware of. The public didn't seem to notice anything wrong with the ballots.
Kamisato Ayaka: Moreover, there were no complaints when people thought that outfits from popular works would make an appearance in the exhibition match. On the contrary, everyone seemed to think it was a special surprise.
Kamisato Ayaka: Since our goal was to generate interest in the competition, the consequences of this mistake shouldn't be viewed a "blunder."
Paimon: Wait, Ayaka, so do you mean thatâ€”
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes, I think we should just make the best of this mistake. In the final exhibition match, I'll simply wear whichever outfit accumulated the most votes.
Onodera: Yes, but... that will make things difficult for you, Miss Kamisato. Unlike outfits tailored for martial arts, the outfits from the novels aren't designed for combat.
Kamisato Ayaka: It won't be a problem. The Fontaine-style dress from the novel shouldn't be too heavy, so it won't affect my abilities.
Kamisato Ayaka: I'll try to get used to it, even if it's quite different than something I'm accustomed to wearing.
Paimon: Wow, Ayaka is speaking calmly, but Paimon can still feel her courage!
Onodera: Alright, I understand. In that case, we'll proceed with Miss Kamisato's proposal.
Onodera: The outfit we prepared for the readers' meet and greet will be tailored and adjusted according to Miss Kamisato's figure. We'll ensure that the outfit is completely ready for the exhibition match!
Kamisato Ayaka: Thank you. It's a lot to handle, but I'm sure you can manage.
Paimon: Ayaka, will you really be okay wearing some character's cosplay in the exhibition match? You're not pushing yourself because we're here, are you?
Kamisato Ayaka: No, please don't worry. I actually feel relaxed and even a little joyful at the moment.
Kamisato Ayaka: Before, the thought of wearing a fancy dress on the stage of the exhibition match had me worried. I was concerned about whether I would be presentable enough to meet the audience's expectations.
Kamisato Ayaka: However, if I'm wearing the same clothes as a fictional character, then it shouldn't be too big of an issue. The detective in the novel is known for being mischievous and doing things her own way.
Kamisato Ayaka: Everyone watching the exhibition match will be able to experience something new in a traditional form.
Traveler: (So that's what Ayaka was thinking...)
Kamisato Ayaka: And that's not all... Deep down, I've always been looking forward to the day I could wear something different from what I normally do.
Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler, not long after we met, I remember you mentioning that Liyue, Mondstadt... and every nation has their own unique fashion.
Kamisato Ayaka: At that time, I couldn't imagine that one day I would be able to experience all these foreign places. But now, all those wishes that were once impossible don't seem so far out of reach.
Kamisato Ayaka: Besides, my mother was always curious about outfits from other countries when she was alive. This time, I will be able to fulfill my mother's dream.
Kamisato Ayaka: Thinking about it that way, this special outfit can indeed be called a surprise.
Paimon: Huh, in that case, this whole accident with the vote turned out to be a good thing, hehe. Well, now that this is all settled, let's get ready to go to the arena.
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes, I know you will do great, Traveler.
Kamisato Ayaka: Onodera and I will also head to the arena to watch your fight once we've confirmed my outfit's measurements.
