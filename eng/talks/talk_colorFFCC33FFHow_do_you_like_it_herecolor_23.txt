Albedo: Hm, I believe that the utopia referenced in literature would likely resemble this place.
Albedo: Peaceful and comforting, enough for one to forget the time while pouring oneself into research.
Traveler: Remember to eat on time.
Albedo: ...
Albedo: Yes, of course.
Albedo: Ah, right...
Albedo: I will often sketch my surroundings. Your arrangements in this realm also provide a source of inspiration for me.
Albedo: ...Thank you.
Traveler: You can tell me if you need anything.
Albedo: Hm... Let your creative instincts run unabated, and I should be quite content.
