Traveler: About Stormterror...
Bruce: If you ask me, I don't think it's anything serious.
Bruce: The Archon War makes Stormterror look like child's play. If you think about it, there haven't been a lot of casualties at all.
Bruce: In any case, we have our reliable colleagues and our eminent Acting Grand Master. This issue will be solved very soon. Mondstadt won't be in any great danger.
