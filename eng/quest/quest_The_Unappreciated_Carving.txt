# The Unappreciated Carving


## Talk 1

Collei: So Tanger headed this way? I know this place pretty well. Follow me!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hey look, aren't these Collei's footprints? But... why are they headed towards the tree hollow?

## Talk 3

Tanger: Oh, Razi! Thank goodness, I finally found you! What would I do without you, my son?
Tanger: Were you in danger? Did the wild beasts scare you? Did the stars guide your way?
Razi: I'm okay... All thanks to their help.
Tanger: Thank you! Thank you all! I dare say that even the most cold-hearted Spinocrocodile would be moved to tears by your kindness.
Collei: Oh, it's nothing. It's all part of my responsibility as a Trainee Forest Ranger. I'm the one who should thank you for creating so many wonderful stories for the children of Sumeru. I... I love them too!
Tanger: Really? I didn't know anyone read my stories apart from young children. That must mean you're still in touch with your inner child!
Tanger: Hmm, okay then... I have the inspiration for my next story. It shall be about an Aranara granny who's a child at heart!
Collei: Huh!?
Collei: It's... it's an honor to become the source of your inspiration!
Paimon: Whoa, Collei looks like she's about to pass out... Uhh, hey Collei, are you okay?
Collei: Ah, I'm okay. Sorry, I just got a little too excited.
Tanger: Are you two story lovers as well? Yes... Yes! The moment I saw you, the image of an Aragiant and an Arafinch traveling together popped into my mind!
Traveler: We've been tasked with seeking your help.
Tanger: Oh? Who asked for my help? My sincerest apologies, but I have fans all over Sumeru... Trying to remember every last one is like trying to identify each grain of sand in the desert.
Paimon: Umm... Seems like Tanger has a slightly exaggerated view of what it means to be a children's author...
Paimon: Also, Paimon's not a finch! That's nothing to get excited about.
Traveler: Let's put the jokes aside and get down to business.
Black Screen Text: You tell Tanger about the situation at Acara Crafts.
Tanger: Acara Crafts... Acara Crafts...
Tanger: Oh! Oh right, right! I remember now. That small boat once sailed into the sea of my memory, but before long, it floated away over the horizon, never to be seen again.
Tanger: Perhaps for the best: After all, a wild tempest was a-raging in Tanger Harbor.
Paimon: Um, what? Paimon has no idea what he's saying...
Traveler: Me neither.
Paimon: What should we do? Do you think we should get Tighnari to take a look at him?
Razi: Dad's saying he forgot about helping the people at Acara Crafts learn more about Aranara, because right now, he has something more important to do.
Paimon: Oh, THAT's what he meant... Well, there it is, all the proof you needed that this kid is definitely Tanger's son.
Paimon: Wait, no, this isn't the time for all that. Tanger, your help is pretty vital to the toymakers. You gotta do something!
Tanger: But the garden that blooms before my eyes is of greater importance. For therein lies the beautiful Padisarah that all the children of Sumeru dream of.
Tanger: I, Tanger, have found evidence of Aranara activity right here in the Avidya Forest! Conclusively proving that Aranara not only exist in stories, but in real life too!
Tanger: If I manage to document the first real-life Aranara sighting, the petty problems that perplex Acara Crafts will be untangled in no time.
Tanger: Meanwhile, I may well be able to leverage this to assume leadership of the Akademiya. Then, all across Sumeru will know of the great Tanger living in humble Port Ormos!
Traveler: ...
Paimon: ...
Razi: ...*sigh*.
Collei: Um...
Collei: I haven't written any papers myself, but I think you need to have a bunch of them approved by the review board before entering the Akademiya. You also need a detailed and objective experiment record.
Collei: Anyway, Tanger, what did you mean by "evidence of Aranara activity"?
Tanger: The hook's what's important in a story! The great storyteller Tanger never gives his audience the bait right away! Come with me!
Collei: Wait! Not that way...
Paimon: Collei, what's wrong?
Collei: Nothing, but that way leads us deeper into the Avidya Forest. I'm just concerned for Tanger's safety.
Collei: And I think I'm starting to understand why Razi and Tanger were fighting...
Traveler: (Maybe there's something else going on.)
Traveler: (Maybe that's the secret Razi was keeping...)
Traveler: Yup, I'm the Aragiant and she's the Arafinch!
Tanger: Ah, excellent, improvisation! Yes, mount your trusty steed of imagination and canter through the lush meadows of lyrical expression... you have the potential to become a celebrated storyteller too, you know!

## Talk 4

Tanger: Just as I expected, the promise of one of my stories has kept you hot on my heels.
Paimon: But this is just an ordinary tree hollow. Paimon's not seeing any evidence of Aranara.
Tanger: "You can deceive the eyes, but you can't deceive the heart." Look with your heart and you, too, will understand.
Paimon: Um... Paimon's not sure what "look with your heart" means, but anyway, let's start by investigating the area around this tree hollow.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Hey look, there's a note here. Could this be the evidence that Tanger was talking about?
Paimon: Ugh, the handwriting's so hard to read. "It's too hard! I can't remember the names of all these mushrooms"...?
Paimon: Do Aranara need to learn about mushroom classification...?

## Talk 6

Paimon: Here's another note that says, "This tree hollow is my castle."
Paimon: That sounds more like something an Aranara from the stories would say.

## Talk 7

Paimon: There's another one here! Hmm... "If only I were a clever Aranara."
Paimon: A clever Aranara... Is the emphasis on "clever," or "Aranara"?

## Talk 8

Tanger: How does it feel to bear witness to a groundbreaking discovery? Exciting, isn't it?
Traveler: What's so groundbreaking about it?
Tanger: The crude handwriting may look like a child's, but don't forget, we're in the middle of a rainforest.
Tanger: I doubt that a child would be able to reach this deep into the forest, and I doubt even more that they would think of this lowly tree hollow as some sort of impenetrable castle.
Tanger: I boldly hypothesize that this tree hollow is in fact the Aranara's Akademiya. The notes we saw were written by the Aranara themselves. There is no doubt in my mind about that.
Tanger: An Aranara that wasn't so bright left a note here wishing to become a "clever Aranara."
Tanger: I shall craft a new story for them and call it "The Aranara in the Tree Hollow"!
Tanger: How's that? Don't the very words just conjure up images of Aranara in your mind's eye?
Paimon: Uh, nope...
Traveler: Not at all...
Tanger: Well, many an adventurer knows how to take to the skies with their easily visible wind gliders, yet they do not possess the invisible wings of imagination, making it hard for them to keep up with my train of thought.
Tanger: How about you, Miss Forest Ranger? Do you soar into the atmosphere on the wings of imagination?
Collei: Huh!? Me? I don't know... Maybe I do, but maybe not. Anyway... it has nothing to do with me, so...
Traveler: Collei, is everything okay?
Collei: Yeah, I'm fine. It's just that... witnessing Tanger's creative process is a little... um...
Tanger: Overwhelming?
Collei: Oh yes, yes, overwhelming.
Tanger: For now, I've decided to stay here with Razi until we witness the legendary moment when the Aranara appear in this hollow.
Tanger: Don't worry, I won't let the Acara Crafts toymakers down. When a real Aranara appears, their little troubles will be resolved in an instant.
Paimon: He seems pretty stubborn. Looks like we'll have to stay here and wait a little longer.
Collei: No. I think we should return to our camp first.
Collei: Tanger, in "Aranara and the Ill Little Fungus," it says that Aranara are very sensitive creatures. I don't think they'll show up if we stay here.
Tanger: Oh? Was that in the story? Ah... yes, I remember now. Miss Forest Ranger, you sure know your stuff!
Tanger: In that case, let's go back to camp and call it a day. We'll continue our search for evidence first thing in the morning.
Traveler: Are you sure you're not feeling unwell?
Traveler: They looked like messages left by children.

## Talk 9

Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, {NICKNAME}, wake up.
Traveler: What's wrong?
Paimon: It's not the Aranara, it's Collei... She's gone!
Paimon: Paimon's been worried about Collei since last night. Even though she kept telling us she was okay, after we saw the "evidence of Aranara activity," she's been acting kinda strange.
Traveler: I noticed that too.
Paimon: Anyway, let's go find her.
Traveler: Maybe Tanger was too much for her.
Traveler: Did the Aranara show up?

## Talk 10

Paimon: So Collei came back here alone. Is she waiting for the Aranara to show up?
Collei: #*sniff* And I thought this was a place nobody knew about... I never thought Tanger would find it, or that I would run into {NICKNAME} and Paimon...
Collei: *sob* If I'd known, I would have just told the tree hollow instead of writing it down! There must be another way to practice my handwriting...
Collei: Now I've created a whole new problem for myself... What do I do now, dress up as an Aranara...?
Collei: No, that won't work. I should be writing something that an Aranara would never say so that Tanger won't mistake me for one of them.
Collei: But what should I write? What should I write...
Collei: Oh! I've got it! There's no way Tanger could see this as the work of an Aranara.
Paimon: So the "evidence of Aranara activity" we saw during the day, was actually... evidence of Collei's activity.
Paimon: But why didn't she just tell Tanger?
Traveler: Perhaps that's her secret.
Paimon: Oh, right! Collei told Razi that he could tell any secret to a tree hollow. Must be because that's what she does, and now she even writes it down.
Traveler: Collei must have her reasons.
Paimon: Yeah, you're right. We'll keep her secret for her!
Paimon: Looks like she's almost done writing. Let's head back.
Black Screen Text: Early the next morning, Tanger excitedly takes everyone back to the tree hollow.

## Talk 11

Tanger: Aha! There's a new note, just as I expected.
Tanger: Yes, yes! It's the same handwriting, which means it must've been written by the same Aranara.
Tanger: Let's see what it says...
Paimon: Ooh, what could it be?
Traveler: What could it be?
Tanger: ...!?
Tanger: "I want to visit Mondstadt during the Ludi Harpastum again"...?
Tanger: No, that's impossible! This must be some kind of mistake! How could an Aranara go to Mondstadt for the Ludi Harpastum?
Tanger: Even I would never write that into a fairy tale!
Paimon: So in other words, the notes can't have been left by an Aranara.
Collei: Yeah! If you ask me, they were probably left by a passing merchant from Mondstadt or something. Definitely not an Aranara.
Tanger: No! No, I refuse to believe it!
Black Screen Text: Despite his denial, Tanger falls into a deep silence when faced by the facts.
Tanger: ...
Traveler: Please help Acara Crafts.
Tanger: I can't...
Paimon: What do you mean you can't? It's not like it'll take you a huge amount of effort.
Collei: You've written so many stories beloved by the children. I'm sure you can help create carvings that are just as successful.
Traveler: I believe in you, Tanger.
Tanger: No! I can't do it!
Tanger: I thought that if I could find an Aranara, I'd be able to help Acara Crafts.
Tanger: But it was someone from Mondstadt all along...
Collei: But you managed to write all those stories without ever having seen a real Aranara, right? What makes this so different?
Tanger: I... um...
Tanger: *sigh* Razi, you tell them.
Razi: Really? Can I?
Tanger: Yes, it's fine. Tell them, I know this is the moment you've been waiting for.
Razi: Okay.
Razi: #Collei, {NICKNAME}, Paimon. Do you remember when I said that there was a secret I didn't wanna tell anyone?
Traveler: Yup, I do.
Razi: I didn't want to tell anyone the secret, but it made me feel very sad and also turned Dad into a completely different person.
Razi: So... I think I should tell you.
Razi: Dad isn't the one who came up with all those Aranara stories.
Collei: What? Hold on, so if Uncle Tanger wasn't the author, then... who was it? Ah, wait, you don't mean...
Razi: It was me.
Razi: Dad's been telling stories in Port Ormos for as long as I can remember. I always got to listen to all his new stories.
Razi: Every night, Dad would give me a Zaytun Peach for dinner, and I'd eat it while he told his stories.
Razi: The Zaytun Peaches were delicious, but Dad's stories were really bad. He always uses sentences that are really hard to understand, and... strange uh, metaphors I think they're called?
Razi: But Dad kept on going, telling his stories again and again. One time, he even borrowed a Kamera from Lord Sangemah Bay's shop and got me to take pictures of him in action.
Razi: Dad showed me the picture and said that it shall become the precious record of Sumeru's best storyteller early in his career.
Razi: Even though I only had Zaytun Peaches to eat and not-so-great stories to listen to, I was happy.
Razi: Then, one day, I tried telling Dad a story I came up with.
Razi: Dad seemed really excited from the very beginning.
Razi: He looked really happy. He lifted me up high into the air and told me to continue.
Razi: He lifted me up so high that I was looking down at him. As I continued with my story, I saw his expression gradually change.
Razi: And when I got to my favorite part, Dad started crying. I guess he must've been moved by my story.
Razi: When Dad put me back down, I looked up at him again, but now he had a scary look in his eyes...
Paimon: You remember it so vividly...
Tanger: It's not only Razi. I, too, remember every detail of what happened that day.
Tanger: After that, I gradually grew in fame and started making money. I became Sumeru's best storyteller, just as I always dreamed.
Tanger: Finally, we could afford more than just Zaytun Peaches for dinner...
Tanger: I thought it would make Razi happy.
Razi: I was really happy at first... but then everyone started calling me "Tanger's son" instead of "Razi."
Razi: I kinda guessed why, but I also didn't wanna believe it.
Razi: Dad got busier with things that had nothing to do with storytelling... Like that request from Acara Crafts.
Razi: So I made up my mind that this time, I just wanna be good old Razi so that Dad will become good old Dad again...
Razi: Instead of Dad the way he is now, starting every story with "Dedicated to my dearest Razi"...
Razi: I prefer my Dad how he used to be, stumbling over words and not knowing how to end the story.
Razi: That's why I decided to keep how I imagined Aranara to look like, a secret.
Paimon: Wait... Paimon gets it now.
Paimon: To sum up, all of Uncle Tanger's fairytales were actually stories written by Razi.
Paimon: And because Razi didn't want Tanger to keep living a lie, he refused to help him with Acara Crafts' commission.
Tanger: ...Yes. That's why I tried looking for possible evidence of Aranara. But it turned out that I was just being a clown, as always, and not even a funny one.
Tanger: I'm a terrible father.
Tanger: I'm sorry, Razi... I'm so sorry...
Tanger: And I owe you all an apology, too, for wasting your time.
Tanger: Razi's the only one who can help Acara Crafts. If you can manage to persuade him, that is. Right now, I think I just want to find a tree hollow and be quiet for a while.
Paimon: Um... are we gonna let this happen?
Traveler: It's up to Razi.
Razi: You want me to help Acara Crafts with their carving?
Razi: I did mention what the Aranara look like in my stories, but to make a carving, we might need more details...
Razi: #Collei, {NICKNAME}, and Paimon, I might need your help on this one.
Razi: I've never really left Port Ormos before. This is my first time in Gandharva Ville... well, it's my first time being so far from home.
Razi: Sumeru is so much bigger than I thought. Seeing new places has given me loads of new ideas for my Aranara stories.
Razi: So I wanna visit more places in Sumeru. That way, I can help Acara Crafts create an Aranara carving that everyone will love.
Razi: And I also wanna take pictures of Dad everywhere that we travel to.
Tanger: You... you still want me to come with you? Even after all I've done?
Razi: Yeah, of course! C'mon, you're the best Dad ever.
Collei: This is the happiest Razi has sounded since we met him.
Razi: I wanna thank you, Collei.
Collei: Huh? Me? I... I didn't do anything to help.
Razi: You told me about telling my secrets to a tree hollow.
Razi: Even though I didn't have the time to find a tree hollow, telling everyone my secret made me feel so much better.
Collei: Yeah... It's hard to keep too many secrets, and there's no need to hide our mistakes from others all the time.
Collei: I made a lot of mistakes back in Mondstadt. But when I look back on them, it all feels more like a new beginning.
Collei: I'm sure this experience will be the same for Tanger.
Tanger: Yes. I'll do my best to become a good father again.
Tanger: Wait... did you just say you've been to Mondstadt...?
Collei: Ah! Um, I just, uh... just passed by once! Never mind that — come on now, Acara Crafts is waiting for us!
Collei: Let's go, Razi! Grab that Kamera and see what hidden inspiration you can discover along the way!
Razi: Okay, let's go! C'mon, Dad!
Tanger: Razi, slow down and watch your step.
Traveler: Looks like everyone's in good spirits.
Paimon: Yeah!
Traveler: Let's catch up with them!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: Maybe he's a genius who spends a lot of time in solitary confinement.
Razi: Tanger's just a normal guy....
Collei: Even so, he must be more creative than most people.
Collei: Wait, hold on! Razi, do you mean you've met Tanger before?
Razi: Mm-hmm... He's my dad.
Paimon: Your dad!? Tanger's your dad? As in, you're Tanger's son?
Razi: Mm-hmm.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon sees! That guy at Acara Crafts told us that Tanger brought his son along with him. So he meant Razi.
Paimon: Why are you here on your own, though? Did you and Tanger get separated?
Razi: I... We had an argument... I was upset, so I ran off here by myself...
Collei: Oh, in that case... We should take you back to Gandharva Ville first. Then we'll look for your dad and tell him where you are.
Razi: No, I'm good! Thanks for your advice, Collei. I'm not so upset anymore.
Razi: Come with me. I'll take you to him.
Paimon: Yay, thanks Razi! Paimon thought we'd be spending the whole day looking for him!

### Additional Talk 4

Tanger: "You can deceive the eyes, but you can't deceive the heart." This line is at the beginning and also the end of "Aranara's Vow."
Tanger: I'm certain that in a hundred years' time, this line will become a famous proverb in Sumeru... don't you think?

### Additional Talk 5
