Tairona: Should I go to Mualani's store to check out the new surfboards...

Traveler: And can't you go have a look?
Tairona: I can... and can't.
Tairona: If you asked me whether I wanted to go, the answer would be an unequivocal yes.
Tairona: But if you were to ask my wallet whether it could afford the trip, the answer would be "probably not."
Tairona: And if you were to ask my house, it would argue that it could make better use of the Mora by building yet another storage extension.
Tairona: I... I should respect their opinions too, right?

Traveler: Seeya.
Tairona: Take care. I'm going to dwell on my dilemma some more...

Traveler: Are you out on patrol?
Tairona: That's correct. Reconstruction work within the tribe has pretty much all been handed out, so the chief assigned me to patrol the area nearby instead.
Tairona: According to the Pyro Archon, we gave the Abyss a thorough thrashing this time, so there shouldn't be any more major disturbances in the short term. But they are cunning enemies, so we must stay vigilant.
Tairona: So hobbies and whatnot will just have to be set aside for now. As the bearer of an Ancient Name, I'm sure Miss Mualani must have plenty to keep her busy too!

Traveler: Why don't you consider your "work" again?
Tairona: Ah, that's right! Once I enter Mualani's shop, I wouldn't be able to leave. That would mean I would also no longer be able to work. That's a perfectly valid point.
Tairona: ...But if we were to look at it that way, then in the interest of fairness, shouldn't I also pose the question to my other hobbies?
Tairona: I've got a lot of hobbies, you know. Surfing, kayaking, swimming, water polo...
Tairona: If I were to also count their votes, then the final vote would probably be very different.
Tairona: Hmm... Guess I'll do a more comprehensive count of the votes later. This will be a problem for future me...
