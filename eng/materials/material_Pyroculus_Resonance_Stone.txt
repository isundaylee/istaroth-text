# Pyroculus Resonance Stone

A stone that can be used in Natlan to search for nearby Pyroculi.
During its crafting, adjustments were made to imbue it with characteristics resembling those of the Pyro Statues of The Seven, allowing one to sense the blazing power of the Pyroculi through it.
By sacrificing oneself, the Pyroculi can be returned to the statue, reuniting the scattered flames. Perhaps the Resonance Stone deems this sacrifice to be worth it.
