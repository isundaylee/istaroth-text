# Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas: Soliloquy of Distant Island Peaks


## Talk 1

"Kichiboushi": Different from snow mountain. Not cold. No snow.
Paimon: This is Guyun Stone Forest! Legend has it that this is where Rex Lapis defeated that, uh, many-headed water snake thingamabob — what was its name again?
Traveler: The Overlord of the Vortex?
Paimon: Right, that's the one! Osial, the Overlord of the Vortex! This is where it was defeated by Rex Lapis' stone spears and sealed.
"Kichiboushi": Ooh!
Paimon: Cool, eh? But we fought with it too, y'know? Atop Ningguang's Jade Chamber...
"Kichiboushi": Golden Crystalfly!
Paimon: Wait, so that was what you were gushing over? C'mon, Paimon's telling a story over here!
Traveler: Well, it does look different from the ones in Inazuma...
Traveler: He's probably never seen a Crystalfly that wasn't purple...
Paimon: #Well... Guess that's true. Alright, alright. Why don't you catch one for him, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: And you're not gonna do it?
Paimon: Well, you've got more experience at this.
Traveler: It can be done, but we can only capture its Crystal Core.
"Kichiboushi": Yey! Nice!
Traveler: But you're the one who can fly.
Paimon: True, but you've got more experience at catching 'em!
Traveler: Alright.
Traveler: Osial?

## Talk 2

"Kichiboushi": Kapow~ Crystalfly~ Golden Crystalfly!

## Talk 3

"Kichiboushi": ...
"Kichiboushi": Not gold.
Paimon: Huh? The Crystal Core really isn't golden!
Traveler: Well, you both say that, but...
Paimon: Come to think of it, Paimon's never really noticed this even though you've caught lots of Crystalflies in the past...
Paimon: ...Is this what they call "disillusionment"? You know, the thing that happens when you get older?
Traveler: Looks like you're in need of some training yourself, Paimon.
"Kichiboushi": White Fur, can do it.
Paimon: Don't you "you can do it" Paimon! You're the one who's training, Kichiboushi.
Paimon: Still, it is kinda disappointing. Why are the Crystal Cores of Geo Crystalflies not gold?
"Kichiboushi": Right. Gold Crystalfly, why not gold?
Traveler: Crystalflies might just be that kind of organism.
Paimon: Oh well, then. In any case, let's proceed as we planned. Time to take Kichiboushi to see The Alcor!
Traveler: I honestly don't know the answer to that question.
Traveler: There's not much I can do about it.

## Talk 4

Paimon: See The Alcor!
"Kichiboushi": Amazing! So much water!
"Kichiboushi": And so big! So big, on the water!
"Kichiboushi": So big, must be heavy. Why not sinking?
Paimon: That's because The Alcor is a ship.
"Kichiboushi": But, mud boat sink. Ioroi tell story. Story of rabbit, bake-danuki, and the mud boat.
Paimon: Um, well, The Alcor isn't made of mud. That's why it won't sink.
"Kichiboushi": Why will not-mud ship not sink?
Paimon: Huh, you're becoming more fluent, Kichiboushi. But at the same time, how are we supposed to answer this question...
Paimon: #Right! Hehe, {NICKNAME}, why do ships float on the water's surface?
Traveler: Ships are made of wood. All hail the power of Dendro!
Paimon: Eh? Can Dendro really do that?
Paimon: Um... Then why don't hilichurls with wooden shields float?
"Kichiboushi": Mmmph. Didn't get it.
Paimon: Don't worry, Kichiboushi. Someday, when you're older, you'll be as smart as Paimon! Then you'll understand all these things: why ships float, why it snows in Dragonspine... You'll know it all!
Traveler: I'm not sure you know either, Paimon.
Paimon: Hey, come on!
Paimon: Yup! Whatever the case, we can see The Alcor from here. Let's take a photo of Kichiboushi!
"Kichiboushi": Photo! Drawing!
Paimon: Yup, that's right! Alright, stand still for a moment now!
Traveler: It's fine if you don't get it yet.
Traveler: You can get by without understanding some things.
Traveler: Ships can float as long as their buoyancy exceeds the pull of gravity.
Paimon: Ooh, is that how it is? Paimon gets it.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Next, let's bring Kichiboushi onboard The Alcor!
"Kichiboushi": Not good. If boat sinks...
Traveler: Relax, this boat won't sink.
Traveler: This ship took us all the way to Inazuma.
Paimon: Exactly! And that's how we came to meet you and Ioroi. So don't worry, it'll be fine!
"Kichiboushi": Mm! Understood.
Paimon: Captain Beidou is a real steady hand, and so are the rest of her crew. Basically, this ship is the safest place on the high seas!
"Kichiboushi": Mm! Yey!

## Talk 6

Paimon: See! The view's great, isn't it?
"Kichiboushi": Mm! Very good!
"Kichiboushi": Many mountains over there. What place is that?
Paimon: Hmm? Well...
Traveler: That's Inazuma.
Paimon: That's right. That should be Mt. Yougou over there — and beneath it? That's where Chinju Forest is.
"Kichiboushi": So far. Ioroi, across the sea.
Paimon: That's right. But we'll be with you all the way!
"Kichiboushi": Mm!
Paimon: Well then, where to next...
Paimon: Is there somewhere familiar where we can find some good food?
Traveler: Of course it's about food with you, Paimon.
"Kichiboushi": Good food, good idea!
Paimon: #Aw! See, {NICKNAME}? Kichiboushi knows what's up. Eating all the good food in the world is good training too, you know?
Paimon: Kichiboushi will surpass you pretty quick if you don't wise up!
Paimon: Right? Climbing the mast sure was tiring.
"Kichiboushi": White Fur climb? But White Fur can fly.
Paimon: Eh, details!
Paimon: Whatever the case, we'll stop here today. Paimon's gotta have a good think about where we'll go next.
"Kichiboushi": Mm!
Traveler: Guess it's just as well that I'm feeling a little peckish.
Traveler: That's where you're from.

### Additional Talk 2

"Kichiboushi": Mm! Training is fun!
Traveler: As long as you're having fun.
"Kichiboushi": Yellow Fur very strong. Kapow — big and round thing gone.
Traveler: That's because I train regularly, you know?
"Kichiboushi": Mm! Kichiboushi, become strong like Yellow Fur!
"Kichiboushi": Train, train, and train. Strong-strong!
Traveler: What do you plan to do once you become stronger, Kichiboushi?
"Kichiboushi": Get back at Gyoubu Koban, mmhaha!
