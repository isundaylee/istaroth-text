# Sour Sauce Ceviche

Raw pieces of fish with a fruity fragrance. The fish — which must be fresh — is first skinned and cut into thick chunks, then marinated in the sour sauce until the fish turns white, after which shredded vegetables are added for seasoning. A combination of sour and spicy flavors, it is one of Natlan's most classic flavors.
