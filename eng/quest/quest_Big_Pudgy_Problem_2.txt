# Big Pudgy Problem!

Timid Morrow: #Thâ€”Thank you kindly, {M#sir}{F#ma'am}...
Timid Morrow: I may be a hunter by trade, but I've sure met my match with these darned slimes.
Timid Morrow: Thanks to them, once again I got nothing to show for this hunt. Ain't caught squat.
Timid Morrow: I sure hope them other hunters ain't as unfortunate as me.
Timid Morrow: Speaking of slimes and such... Could you take a look-see around here for me?
Timid Morrow: It could just be my imagination, but... they seem to be showing up more and more 'round this town.
Timid Morrow: Can you check the road ahead for slimes? If you see any... you know what to do.
Traveler: Sure, I have time.
Timid Morrow: You're doing me a great service. Well, I'd better get back and report all this to Draff.
Timid Morrow: Here's hoping he isn't so drunk that it goes in one ear and out the other!
Traveler: Sorry, I have to get back.
Timid Morrow: #Please {M#sir}{F#ma'am}, if not for me, then for the sake of everyone in Springvale.
