# Mondstadt Glider


## Talk 1

Amber: Hey — here, over here!
Amber: I'm all set up. Let's carry on with the exam.
Amber: Same deal as before, glide through the markers and get to the finish without stopping in the middle.
Traveler: I'm ready.

## Talk 2

Amber: Hahaha... Seems like you've got the hang of wind gliding now! Let's do the final stage.
Paimon: Easy! You've flown this way before anyway...
Amber: Once you've passed this final stage, you'll finally be able to get your very own gliding license.
Amber: Just keep thinking about that license. Ready...
Traveler: ...Go!

## Talk 3

Otto: I am Otto of the Knights of Favonius.
Paimon: Wh—What's going on?
Otto: Please show me your gliding license.
Traveler: Ahh... my um, gliding license is, uh...
Otto: It is against the law to glide without a license! I am arresting you under Section 7, Article 12 of the Mondstadt Penal Code.
Otto: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will forever carry on the wind.
Amber: Wait... I'm an instructor. This is a gliding exam.
Otto: Oh... I see.
Otto: Well, you picked a bad time to hold your gliding exam.
Amber: Really, why?
Otto: The Knights of Favonius received a report from a Sister at the Cathedral claiming she saw Raptor gliding around these parts. I thought your student here must have been his partner in crime.
Paimon: Raptor? Who's that?
Otto: A known criminal in Mondstadt. He always uses a wind glider to commit his crimes, so people started calling him Raptor.
Amber: Wow. He flies fast, then?
Otto: So far we haven't managed to catch him... Our plan this time was to draw him into the Cathedral with a precious artifact, and ambush him inside.
Otto: ...But he escaped with the artifact.
Otto: Fortunately, one of the Sisters put some secret markings on the artifact using elemental magic!
Otto: ...But he was too fast, and we couldn't even keep up with the trail the markings left behind.
Amber: Well, if you need help chasing down a gliding criminal, I'm the one for the job! So tell me, which way did he go?
Otto: As far as I know, he was last seen near Springvale, but that was some time ago.
Amber: #Leave it to me! With me and Traveler chasing him down together, he doesn't stand a chance.
Traveler: Sure.
Amber: Once we've got this Raptor guy, we'll pick up where we left off.
Amber: But no need to worry... I'll be sure to have a word with Jean.
Traveler: So... I passed?
Traveler: It got eaten by Baron Bunny...
