# Rock 'n' Roll Dango Milk

Having sat beneath the stage for a day and a night, this Dango Milk has been fermented using the yeast of Rock 'n' Roll, transforming it into Rock 'n' Roll Dango Milk!
They say that its flavor has undergone some marvelous change, but still more amazingly, it can be sold for twice the price of the original version!
That really rocks.
