# The Reason We Are Gathered Here


## Talk 1

Safwan: Hello and welcome, everyone. I am Safwan, a scholar from the Akademiya, and I will serve as this debate's adjudicator.
Safwan: I swear to judge both parties with the utmost wisdom and impartiality. I will neither interfere with the proceedings nor demonstrate bias.
Safwan: I ask for both parties to stand. May the Dendro Archon also serve as a witness to this duel of wits.
Sharif: Since you so desperately demand an explanation, I will expound on the Akademiya's stance.
Sharif: You may have misunderstood us from the outset, and believed that the Akademiya is prejudiced against you.
Sharif: However, the truth is that the Akademiya wishes for every resident of Sumeru to be afforded opportunities to grow and cultivate their wisdom.
Sharif: Therefore, the works they consume should also possess enlightening qualities and intellectual value.
Sharif: We have failed to identify these qualities in the shows performed at Zubayr Theater.
Sharif: In other words, instead of struggling against the Akademiya in pointless confrontations, if you had spent your time reflecting on improving the quality of your shows and enlightening your audience...
Sharif: Zubayr Theater would not be today facing such a tragic fate.
Paimon: Aggressive from the get-go. He's really putting on the pressure...!
Paimon: Can Nilou stand her ground?
Nilou: (Calm down, Nilou... First, carefully analyze what he said.)
Nilou: (He said that we were shut down not because the Akademiya looks down on the arts, but rather because our shows aren't up to their standards. However...)

## Talk 2

Nilou: In your eyes, our shows can't meet the Akademiya's expectations.
Nilou: Shouldn't it be the audience who decides if a show is intellectual or enlightening? Why is someone from the Akademiya judging that?
Nilou: Also, I believe that there is no such thing as a wiser or more enlightening performance.
Nilou: Art doesn't discriminate, and it appeals to all. Everyone has the right to appreciate art.
Sharif: Appreciation is but a primitive form of satisfaction. Guidance and enlightenment are necessary if we are to induce growth in the performers as well as the audience.
Sharif: This stance holds performers to a higher standard and encourages the development of the arts.
Sharif: If all performances are simple-minded, require little effort to comprehend, and lack any impetus for the betterment of society, then the people will not be able to develop a greater level of artistic understanding.
Sharif: Nurturing the populace's understanding requires a long and arduous process, and guiding this process is the Akademiya's true goal.
Nilou: (He changed the topic without batting an eye! Good thing I'm prepared.)
Nilou: (If I remember correctly, what I should say here is...)

## Talk 3

Nilou: Oh, it's you.
Traveler: Feeling any calmer?
Nilou: Yes, I feel a lot better. The more I think back on everything, the more surreal it all feels.
Nilou: I don't think I could repeat what I did a second time.
Traveler: All of our preparations paid off.
Nilou: Yes, and it's all thanks to you.
Traveler: Now that I've heard everyone else's stories...
Nilou: Hehe, I see. You mean how fate brought me to the theater, right?
Nilou: Then, I'll have to tell you about my teacher, who Mr. Zubayr had mentioned.
Nilou: Mr. Zubayr opened his theater when I was still a child.
Nilou: There was a beautiful dancer, and from the moment I saw her, I couldn't look away.
Nilou: I thought to myself, "The gods must have blessed her with such talent."
Nilou: But later on, she would actually smile down at me and say, "Just the opposite, in fact."
Traveler: The opposite?
Nilou: Yeah. She said, "Dance is an art born from toil. It isn't a gift from the gods, but a creation by our own hands."
Nilou: "It is a beautiful thing born from our life experiences. Whenever there is joy or something to be celebrated, people will dance."
Nilou: "In other words, any place where people can effortlessly begin a dance will for sure be filled with the blessings of everyone's happiness."
Nilou: She wasn't looking for flowers and applause — all she wanted was to see her audience smile.
Traveler: So that is...
Nilou: Right, the same as what Mr. Khasani believes.
Nilou: I was completely moved by what she had said, so I started taking dance lessons from her. And later on, I began to dance here in her stead.
Nilou: Before she retired, she told me, "For as long as you live, never forget what dance means to others."
Nilou: This is why Mr. Zubayr and I never intended to listen to the Akademiya.
Nilou: Even though it ended up causing everyone a whole lot of trouble, thankfully, everything worked out in the end.
Traveler: I see.
Nilou: Mhm, although I do have a small regret.
Traveler: Inayah?
Nilou: Yeah. Even though she has already decided to stop fighting with her father, they never managed to have a real conversation with each other.
Nilou: Before he left, Mr. Sharif looked like he had a lot on his mind.
Nilou: He probably has a lot of things he wants to say, but will now perhaps never get a chance to.
Traveler: That really is a shame.
Nilou: Yeah, but I still hope that things can change. It never hurts to have hope.
Nilou: You and Paimon are more than welcome to keep attending our shows.
Nilou: Hehe, who knows, next time, you might see Inayah on the stage.
Traveler: That might be for the best.
Traveler: Looks like you won't have to worry anymore.
Traveler: What art means to people.
Traveler: I want to hear yours.

## Talk 4

Nilou: Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to our newest member: Inayah!
Inayah: H—Hello, everyone...
Nilou: She'll be dancing for us from now on, so please give her your support.
Paimon: Inayah's taken her place on the stage! Paimon wonders how she'll look once she starts dancing.
Paimon: When you stop and think about it, happy endings like this sure aren't easy to come by!
Traveler: A lot of things came together to make it happen.
Paimon: Nilou's efforts, everyone's wisdom, Inayah's determination...
Traveler: And Sharif's mercy.
Paimon: Huh? What do you mean by that?
Traveler: I think he intentionally gave us a chance.
Paimon: You do have a point there...
Paimon: The whole demolition thing was going overboard, but he really could've banned Nilou and the others from dancing.
Paimon: If he really wanted to be ruthless, he could've done some real damage, even without winning the debate.
Paimon: Oh well, it's not like we can understand how people like him think. Let's focus on watching the performance!
Traveler: Agreed.
Paimon: Huh!? Wait, look who the cat dragged in!
Paimon: Isn't that Inayah's father!?
Traveler: Let's go greet him.
Sharif: Oh, it's you two.
Sharif: I don't have much to do today, so I just came to look around this place.
Paimon: Hmph, are you looking for Inayah?
Sharif: No, I am simply here to watch a performance. There is no need to trouble her.
Traveler: Shouldn't you be busy?
Sharif: Well, I was, for a time.
Sharif: My loss at the debate caused quite the loss of face for the Akademiya, so there was a period of unrest.
Sharif: I used this opportunity to suggest that my superiors temporarily suspend me from duty. Otherwise, the rumors would probably persist for even longer.
Paimon: Suspended from duty...
Sharif: Yes, I am temporarily unemployed. However, I now have an abundance of time, so I can afford to come here and watch a show.
Sharif: I admit that I do not understand the magic that this theater possesses, but my curiosity has been piqued.
Sharif: I still cannot forget that young lady's perseverance. Inayah would almost certainly mature in the presence of such a person.
Traveler: So you're still concerned about your daughter.
Sharif: There are no parents who do not worry about their children. I suppose she managed to hit a weak spot of mine.
Sharif: Never mind. I do not have the right to say that.
Paimon: You're already here, so you might as well go see her.
Sharif: No, that is not necessary. I will take my leave after the show concludes.
Sharif: ...Do not tell her that I was here.
Paimon: Like father, like daughter. They're both so awkward with their feelings!
Nilou: Yeah, she probably would've snuck away as well if I didn't drag her back.
Paimon: Do you think they'll be able to reconcile?
Nilou: I'm not sure. A complete reconciliation may also not be the best thing for them right now.
Nilou: All those years of arguments and misunderstandings can't be settled overnight. It might be best if they continue to keep some distance for now.
Nilou: But no matter where their hearts and bodies may be, they will always be family.
Nilou: All I wish for them is to be able to one day tap into the warmth of that bond.
Nilou: Oh, by the way, everyone's really thankful to you for helping out with the debate.
Nilou: So we made you a little something. Hope you'll like it!
Paimon: I—Isn't this Zubayr Theater?
Paimon: Whoa, this is amazing... It's so detailed and polished...
Nilou: Hee-hee, we've also never made anything this complicated before.
Nilou: Mr. Zubayr and Mr. Khasani took charge of the design, while Inayah and I made all the little pieces with the help of others.
Nilou: Ms. Rekhar and Miss Najia made and assembled the centerpiece.
Nilou: As adventurers, you two will doubtlessly travel to many more lands and see many more things.
Nilou: That's why we hope that your time at Zubayr Theater will become a fond memory of your journey. You two are welcome back anytime!
Paimon: Mhm, we'll come back and watch you dance whenever we get the chance!
Traveler: Thank you all for being so considerate.
Nilou: You're welcome, and there's no need to be so polite. You learned fast!
Nilou: Come on, take it. This is the story of you and me. It's a tale that I'll never, ever forget.
Traveler: According to custom, I should drop the formalities and just accept it, right?
Traveler: Enough of him for now.
Traveler: He didn't have to agree to the debate.

## Talk 5

Nilou: Someone at our theater has tried that before.
Nilou: He was a famed artist, but he recognized that very few people could connect with his works.
Nilou: I agree that art should be enlightening, but we can't pursue that goal by creating complicated works.
Nilou: If a work can't tap into an audience's personal experiences or feelings, then its contents may as well be a castle in the sky.
Nilou: What's the point of performing a show that its audience can't even follow?
Nilou: That would only be forcing people to watch something they don't like.
Sharif: You can only reach that conclusion from a place of ignorance.
Nilou: In that case, before passing judgment, you should first become a better dancer than me.
Farhad: You tell them, Nilou!
Kourosh: Looks like he's backed himself into a corner...
Safwan: As the party holding the burden of proof, Sharif has failed to provide sufficient support for his judgment of the quality of Zubayr Theater's programs.
Safwan: Likewise, the definition that Nilou put forth is but her personal opinion. Neither party is the victor for this particular point of contention.
Safwan: ...Additionally, I must request that both parties exercise greater control on their emotions.
Paimon: Keep it up, Nilou! You're doing great!
Sharif: In that case, I shall speak of more concrete matters. The essence of this issue is that you have violated the law, so you must now pay the price for your transgression.
Sharif: This course of action is also completely procedurally sound. We have already contacted Zubayr Theater multiple times regarding the theater's repertoire.
Sharif: However, you have consciously ignored our warnings — or perhaps your compliance was purely superficial. Regardless, that failure has indirectly led to the present day's proceedings.
Safwan: That is indeed so, according to the laws decreed by the Akademiya.
Nilou: (He's started talking about procedural stuff, so I need to focus on...)

## Talk 6

Nilou: Mr. Zubayr has already provided signed copies of all documentation related to our operations. Everything is perfectly filled out and valid.
Nilou: Although the theater's performances don't align with the Akademiya's requests, the law doesn't say that Zubayr Theater can be demolished only because of that reason.
Nilou: Demolition notices need to be provided in writing and made available to the public. Otherwise, the theater can continue to operate as long as its license is valid.
Nilou: Failing to follow these rules makes your stance procedurally unsound.
Abhi: Yeah, yeah!
Sohrin: That's right!
Sharif: ...There are different ways to apply the rules. There is precedent for this.
Sharif: So long as this matter is discussed within the Akademiya, this course of action will come to pass.
Safwan: Looking at the past 27 cases of similar nature, 90% of them support Sharif's claim and position.
Safwan: However, the demolition process in those cases was only started after discussion at the Akademiya. In other words, premature notice of demolition is indeed a rash act.
Nilou: That's more than enough. We've proven that the order is unreasonable as it currently stands.
Sharif: ...Hmph. Cease your futile resistance.
Paimon: Nilou's definitely won this point, right?
Traveler: She still can't let down her guard.
Paimon: You're right... Stay focused, Nilou!
Sharif: Even if permission for demolition has yet to be obtained, it is a fact that your performances violated the Akademiya's policies on numerous occasions.
Sharif: Based on that fact, we can permanently revoke your right to perform in Sumeru.
Nilou: Ah...
Safwan: Under the current system, it is indeed possible to immediately revoke Zubayr Theater's performing rights.
Paimon: That's a thing!?
Traveler: I figured.
Sharif: Rather than protecting Zubayr Theater, I surmise that your true intention is to maintain your hold over your audience, and their patronage as your source of income.
Sharif: Without them, Zubayr Theater is nothing more than an empty building.
Sharif: And without its performances, the theater has nothing else of value.
Nilou: What you said isn't true at all!
Paimon: Ahh, keep it cool, Nilou!
Traveler: Don't get riled up.
Nilou: (Right, I need to keep calm, but he...)
Nilou: (Just a little more. Zubayr Theater isn't just a performance venue to us...)
Traveler: He's intentionally provoking you.
Traveler: That's his back-up plan.
Traveler: He'll bite back.

## Talk 7

Nilou: You two are welcome here anytime! Seeing you safe and sound in between adventures will keep me from worrying too much about you.
Nilou: I think I already see you two as people of the Grand Bazaar. Yep, without a doubt.

## Talk 8

Paimon: During the debate, you said that you found a new wish. What was it?
Inayah: I actually... want to learn how to dance from Nilou.
Paimon: That's a great wish, but with your shyness, are you really going to be okay going up on stage?
Inayah: I—I'll try my best...
Inayah: Nilou wasn't born an expert, either!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*
