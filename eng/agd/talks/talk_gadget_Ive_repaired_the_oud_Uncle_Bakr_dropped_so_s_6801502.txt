# Talk Dialog

Battered Notebook: "...I've repaired the oud Uncle Bakr dropped, so stop crying by yourself, alright? You can talk to Khayyam and me if you're unhappy..."
Battered Notebook: "...I've been accepted into the Akademiya! Haha, congratulations to me! I don't want to be some warriors wife! I'm going to be Siman, the Great Sage!"
Battered Notebook: "Hehe... Irfan the 'Great Musician' and Khayyam 'the Wise,' eh? Don't forget me! Especially you, Khayyam! Don't you forget me!"
Battered Notebook: "...Farewell, notebook! Farewell, Irfan and Siman, my best friends! I hope that the forest never forgets our story, and I hope we remember each other..."
Battered Notebook: (...The rest is messy and filled with the children's happy and sorrowful memories...)
Battered Notebook: "...Aranakin disappeared. I have no idea when, but he's really gone. It's time for me to bid farewell to the oud too. I'll become a craftsman, just like my father hoped I would..."
Battered Notebook: (There seems to be more, but it's been crossed and blacked out with ink.)
Battered Notebook: "...To who's reading this notebook, if I by some miracle am allowed to meet Aranakin and the others again, years from now, then please give this flower to him..."
Paimon: Hey, something fell out of the notebook!
Paimon: It looks like... a flower? It looks... exactly like the flower we got.
