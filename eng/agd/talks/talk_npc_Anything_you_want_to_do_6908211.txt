# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Baizhu: Anything I want to do? The human lifespan is limited to no more than a century, and we often find ourselves with endless desires and insufficient time.
Baizhu: But we don't have to start being all deep and existential in a casual conversation... There's actually something I'm planning to do.
Baizhu: Liyue Harbor is a large place. Sometimes, people get severely injured and become incapacitated, while others may land themselves in situations where it's difficult for them to ask for help.
Baizhu: In either case, it is often well past the golden hour for treatment when the doctor finally arrives at the scene.
Baizhu: People often wish for doctors to become more efficient, but I'm not able to teleport between places, and as a result, the best window for treatment is often missed.
Baizhu: In situations like this, the patient should first try to help themselves.
Baizhu: There are many ways to render self aid before help arrives, but not everyone is aware of them.
Baizhu: As a doctor, that's something within my power to change â€” I'm thinking of coming up with some ways to teach people basic first aid.
Traveler: I think that's a great cause.
Baizhu: Being a doctor comes with great responsibility, so I'm just trying to do my duty.
Baizhu: Having someone listen to me while I think aloud at length is already a great help.
Baizhu: I'll make sure to go over the details with you once I've put together a better plan.
Baizhu: I might need your help again when the time comes.
Traveler: Can I help in any way?
Baizhu: I've drafted a preliminary plan, but I still need to go over a few details to make the whole process more efficient.
