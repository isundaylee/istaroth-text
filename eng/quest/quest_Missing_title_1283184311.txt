Citlali: Hm? You alright?
Citlali: I have to return the ceremonial sword to the chief shortly, but I'll leave everything else in the camp as-is for now. Feel free to make use of it.
Traveler: Um... I have the latest volume of "Mirage Warriors" here...
Citlali: ...Huh?
Traveler: ...Along with a special-edition spinoff of "The Case Files of Miss Orith."
Citlali: HUH!?
Traveler: Wanna read them together?
Citlali: Uhh...
Citlali: #(What is this? What's going on? How did {F#s}he know I like those books? Don't tell me... Has {F#she}{M#he} been trying to find out what I'm into?)
Citlali: (No, that's ridiculous, don't be silly... I bet Ororon sold me out, the little scamp...)
Citlali: #(Still... {F#s}he remembered, that's gotta mean something, right? Why make a note of some mundane detail like that?)
Citlali: #(Ugh, focus! {F#She}{M#He} asked me a question! Umm, umm, umm... Argh, how do I respond?)
Citlali: Ahem...
Citlali: Sure, why not. I should have some time later. I'll let you know.
