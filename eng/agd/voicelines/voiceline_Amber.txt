# Amber Voicelines

## Hello
Outrider Amber reporting for duty! Just say the word if you ever need my help!

## Chat: Hobbies
I feel like running.

## Chat: Longings
Jean will be upset if she catches us lazing around like this.

## Chat: New Discoveries
Hey, there's something strange over there... C'mon, let's take a look!

## When It Rains: Worries
Oh no, it's raining... now my uniform will get all wet...

## When It Rains: Reminder
It's raining again... This will hinder our vision, we must remain vigilant!

## After the Rain
Wow~ This weather is awesome!

## When the Sun Is Out
If only the wind was a little stronger...

## When It's Windy: Pleasant
This breeze... so refreshing!

## When It's Windy: Relax
I love this kind of weather, ahh... so relaxing~

## Good Morning
Morning! Want to go on a jog?

## Good Afternoon
Can I get lunch with you?

## Good Evening
It's getting late, should I light a torch?

## Good Night
Agreed, getting rest is essential! Let's meet here tomorrow then. See ya!

## About Amber
Mondstadt Gliding Champion, yep, that's me! Gliding Champion!

## About Us: Contests
Remember that I don't go easy on anyone, even you!

## About Us: Gliding
When I'm teaching you to glide, I feel like I can go even faster than usual... Huh? What are you laughing at? I'll prove it! We can race — right now!

## About the Vision
My Vision... Is a sign that the Archons believe in me. Yes, I must become the best Outrider I can possibly be!

## Something to Share
The view from the Cathedral's clock tower is amazing! You should check it out.

## Interesting Things
Look, there's a pigeon over there! *giggle* I wish I could fly alongside them.

## About Jean: Help
After the Grand Master left on his expedition, all the affairs of the Knights of Favonius, both big and small, have been left up to Jean. If only there was more I could do to help her...

## About Jean: Care
Jean might still be working? We should invite her for coffee... Let's go.

## About Lisa: Listening to Stories
When you have time, we should go see Lisa! Last time I saw her, she was telling me about a story involving a treasure in the Dragonspine area. But, we got cut off before she could finish. I can't wait to hear the rest of her story!

## About Lisa: Admiration
If Lisa's not sleeping, she'll be reading! I don't know how she does it, I wouldn't be able to sit still for that long.

## About Kaeya: Concerns
...I'm feeling uneasy all of a sudden! Was that Kaeya with you earlier? Did he give you any trouble?

## About Kaeya: Culprit
There's something weird-looking about the dandelions in the garden... Hmm, I bet Kaeya had something to do with this!

## About Bennett
Hmm? Bennett... I feel like I've heard that name before... Oh! Yes, he's that hot-blooded guy from the Adventurers' Guild, right! I tend to come across him way out in the wild from time to time, he seems to really love treasure hunting.

## About Klee
Klee? She can be a bit cheeky sometimes, but everyone in the Knights of Favonius likes her. Although... I really ought to keep a closer eye on her if I wanna keep her from getting put in confinement by Jean again.

## About Albedo
Albedo spends most of his time in his workshop, tinkering away with all of his awesome stuff. But, when you see him in person, you can never quite tell what he is thinking, not a clue at all.

## About Noelle
You wanna know about Noelle? She's super resilient. Still, since she's younger than us, we should look out for her.

## About Eula
Eula is a great friend of mine! You just need to get used to her sense of humor and you'll get along fine! The only reason she's misunderstood by so many people is her family name. How can I get them to see her for who she really is?

## About Collei
Collei wrote to me saying that her Eleazar has been completely cured... I'm so happy for her! I wish I could fly to her side right now and give her the biggest hug! She also said she misses everyone in Mondstadt, and that once she's ready, she'll come visit us in person and tell us all about her progress... Oh, it would be great if she could make it in time for the next Ludi Harpastum. Aaah I can't wait to see her again!

## About Mika
Oh! Mika's a veteran of Eula's team. When he first arrived, it was always "Yes, Commander!" every time he spoke to me — I guess it must have been because he saw how close I was with Eula. But then, even after I told him I was actually an Outrider, he still called me "Ma'am"... It was so embarrassing. We have completely different responsibilities, after all. I definitely could never match his expertise in cartography.

## More About Amber: I
I'm a pro at hunting, you know! How about I show you some of my skills? Or even better... how about a little competition?

## More About Amber: II
I'll share my ultimate Gliding Champion secret with you! The most important thing to remember, is to have courage!

## More About Amber: III
I'm really not that good with riddles. I always try to avoid the riddles stand during Ludi Harpastum... What about you?

## More About Amber: IV
I joined the Knights because of my grandpa, I stayed because of Jean. And now, you're the one that showed me the world beyond Mondstadt. I couldn't be happier.

## More About Amber: V
I would like to explore the other worlds beyond. I wanna see how deep the rabbit hole goes! You'll keep me company, right?

## Amber's Hobbies
Baron Bunny, today is another squeaky clean day!

## Amber's Troubles
Oh... Do you have any idea how to make a decent Moon Pie?

## Favorite Food
Jean makes the most amazing cup of coffee! You'll have to try it sometime.

## Least Favorite Food
I can handle anything and everything! As long as it isn't cold Wolfhook juice... Ugh, yuck...

## Receiving a Gift: I
Wow! This is delicious, you're an amazing cook!

## Receiving a Gift: II
I wish I was as good at cooking as you...

## Receiving a Gift: III
Uh, I'm just not used to this taste, sorry! Nothing to do with you of course!

## Birthday
Hey, happy birthday! Here, I have a gift for you: an exclusive, custom-made version of Baron Bunny that I sewed for you myself. Uh... don't worry, "custom-made" means that it won't explode!

## Feelings About Ascension: Intro
Yeah! As fast as riding the wind!

## Feelings About Ascension: Building Up
At this speed, no one can keep up with me!

## Feelings About Ascension: Climax
The skies over Mondstadt seem to have gotten smaller... or is it that my sight reaches further than ever before?

## Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion
It seems that now... I've improved so much compared to when we first met! Hehe, thank you so much! Let me treat you to a Sticky Honey Roast! Let's go, let's go!

Opening a chest is like unwrapping a gift!
