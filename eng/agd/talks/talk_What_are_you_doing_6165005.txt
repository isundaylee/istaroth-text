Traveler: What are you doing?
Old Finch: Oh, me? I'm chatting with the Spring Fairy.
Old Finch: My name's Finch. Haha, but I'm old now, as you can see, so everyone calls me Old Finch.
Traveler: Tell the Fairy I said hello.
Old Finch: ...Of course, of course. She likes everyone around these parts.
Old Finch: Way back when, she used to sneak into people's dreams to see the scenes being woven there.
Old Finch: Now, she even likes poems. She often reads them to me in my dreams.
Old Finch: Hahaha, but there's so much more she still wants to learn.
