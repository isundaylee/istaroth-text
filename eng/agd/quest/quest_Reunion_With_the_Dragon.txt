# Reunion With the Dragon


## Talk 1

Diluc: Everyone is finally here.
Paimon: What a view...
Venti: Lovely for a fated reunion, isn't it?
Venti: Well, we must be prepared for a fight.
Jean: Regardless of the outcome, things finally seem to be taking a turn for the better.
Jean: Mondstadt has really been going through so much recently...
Diluc: Huh! In the end, the solution to our problem was as simple as a traveler and a song.
Diluc: I suppose the Knights of Favonius may have played a part in it too...
Venti: Oh, we get it, Master Diluc... Everyone, please step aside!
Venti: I, the best wandering bard of the mortal world, shall begin my performance with the Holy Lyre.

## Talk 2

Jean: Barbatâ€” Venti, please, be careful...
Venti: Hehe... You've known my true identity for some time now, haven't you Jean?
Venti: Though, I thank you for continuing to use the name Venti.
Diluc: How's the Holy Lyre?
Diluc: Can it still be played? Or does it need to be repaired?
Venti: Wow...
Venti: Unfortunately, I think it's beyond repair...
Traveler: We can't let this Abyss Mage get away!
Diluc: You're right. If we don't fight the evil at its source, then we can't save Dvalin at all.
Jean: In which case I shall call upon Outrider Amber to track it down...
Diluc: No need.
Jean: Why is that?
Diluc: I eradicated one not long ago, in one of the Four Winds' temples.
Paimon: What!? When...?
Diluc: If you want to track those monsters down, then I'll seek answers from my contacts. I've got other means for getting the job done.
Paimon: Diluc...
Paimon: Though he dislikes the Knights of Favonius, he protects Mondstadt in his own way.
Venti: Ooh? Why does our little Paimon sound so doting all of a sudden?
Diluc: Hmph.
Diluc: Wait for my word.
Diluc: I'll be sure to let the Abyss Order know that their blatant disregard for Mondstadt...
Diluc: ...will not go unpunished.
Traveler: Dvalin is in a lot of danger...
Diluc: No, we should make that Abyss Mage pay first!
Diluc: If we don't fight the evil at its source, then we can't save Dvalin at all.
