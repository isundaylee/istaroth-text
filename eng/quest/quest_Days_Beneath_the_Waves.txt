# Days Beneath the Waves


## Talk 1

Yves: What rotten luck! I'm never going underwater again!
Traveler: What's wrong?
Yves: Ah, it's you. It truly is good to see you! I... I nearly lost my life down there.
Yves: I was doing work underwater, just like I usually do. I submerged, dodged the waterweeds, avoided the trash, and managed to not get cut or pierced by anything.
Yves: But just as I was salvaging things, a group of monsters suddenly emerged from the mud!
Yves: I can't quite remember what creatures they were, only that they came rushing at me — I could only flee and swim upward with all my might.
Yves: But not long after, I ran into a group of strange mechanical fish, and they too began mindlessly charging at me the moment they saw me!
Yves: I don't know how I got ashore, but I did, and seemingly without injury too...
Traveler: If things are so dangerous, you should probably stay away from this area.
Yves: But I can't, you see! Goldman designated this spot... never mind that quite a few people were injured, or even lost their lives while working here.
Yves: Over time, even his threats and pay dockings could not convince anyone to perform salvage here.
Yves: So he changed tack after a while, claiming that he'd give anyone willing to come here three times the Mora.
Yves: So... I and a few fellows strapped for cash took the work on, and we even bought a few fishing spears for underwater self-defense.
Yves: But not a few days in, our weapons were either broken or lost... The others went into the city to get a new batch, while I'm here holding the fort.
Traveler: Then why did you go into the water just now?
Yves: They've been gone for ages! If we don't start soon, I don't know how late I'll need to stay up tonight.
Traveler: Let me help you...
Yves: No! That won't do! These are real monsters that'll give you a real fight! Even adventurers can't handle them. Nope, I can't let you do this.
Traveler: I'm no ordinary adventurer.
Yves: Well... certainly not...
Yves: Alright. If you insist, I'll mark that location out for you... But please, stay safe.
Traveler: Do I look like an ordinary adventurer to you?
Traveler: You went underwater without any weapons for self-defense?
Traveler: That sounds way too dangerous. You should find a different spot.
Traveler: What happened this time?

## Talk 2

Yves: Have you helped me salvage those things?

## Talk 3

Yves: That's right, this is what we go trawling for every day. It's just junk, junk, and more junk... Maybe that stingy rogue Goldman eats the stuff...
Yves: Thanks for your help. This is the pay I got as an advance from Goldman — please take it.
Traveler: I can't take this from you.
Yves: But you must! It's your wages for YOUR work. It no longer belongs to me... and if you won't take it, I'm just going to consign this coin pouch to the waters.
Traveler: Alright, alright...
Yves: That's the way! If you need anything salvaged in the future, come look for me. I'll get it out for you in one piece, no matter what it is!
Yves: I need a bit more rest... Ugh...

## Talk 4

Yves: These are... What are all these trinkets? Are these what Goldman really wanted us to salvage?
Yves: Thanks so much for your help! Here... Take this Mora, and don't tell a soul about this.
Yves: If I could sell these, I can purchase a divesuit of my own. No longer would I need to rent from that Goldman!
Traveler: I can't take this from you.
Yves: No, no! This is the wages you deserve. I know this is nothing compared to the effort you had to put in, but it's all I have left. I was planning to get a swig of booze with it tonight...
Yves: So please, take it. I'll take care of a few things, and then I'll figure out how to... y'know, sell this on the sly...
Traveler: My lips are sealed.

## Talk 5

Yves: Pah, that stingy rogue!
Traveler: Could you tell me about Goldman again?
Yves: He's my boss — real specialist in hiring folks like me with no skills, but strength to spare in order to make ends meet.
Yves: A real Fonta-for-brains he is, and he's strict and stingy to boot! He insists that we stick to that big, thick work manual while at work...
Yves: Also, even the divesuits we use at work are stuff he "rents" out to us.
Yves: If we violate those stipulations or our divesuits get damaged, we'll have to pay him instead...
Yves: In other words, if I get careless at work even once, not only will I need to pay him a fee, but I'll need to grovel and beg him to keep me on staff! Pah!
Yves: What do you want to know more about him for, anyways? I'm begging you, please, keep your distance from him — even if it's just for your good name's sake!
Yves: Shameless, that's what he is, and he surrounds himself with some of like kind to him, too. Bad eggs, them.
Yves: Don't associate with that fellow — you'd not clean that mud and filth off your hands, not even with a tower's worth of pure water.
Yves: But see, it takes nary any effort to stain a clear pond using dirty mud.
Traveler: You do some really hard work...
Yves: Hah, and isn't that the truth? But this is the only way I can make a living. I'm not smart, and I don't have any other skills, but I'm not going to turn to crime, either.
Yves: If I must do evil to get the bread, then I'd rather go hungry!
Yves: My lot's rough, yes, but I can close my eyes in peace at night. No need to fear if anyone hates me, or might shank me in my sleep.
Yves: If you think about it that way, my life's way better than Goldman's.
Traveler: See you.
Yves: #Sure. I'll leave the salvage work to you, good {M#sir}{F#lady}. As for me, I still need a bit of rest...

## Talk 6

Yves: Agh, what terrible luck...
Traveler: Were you able to sell the stuff?
Yves: Ah, it's you. Ugh, forget it. I'd just found a buyer too, and that was when Goldman barged into my house and seized that box of trinkets!
Yves: If he didn't still need me to work for him, I'd have taken a real beating, too... He did deduct two months' salary, though...
Yves: He wants to pay me only after I've finished this whole year's worth of work.
Yves: *sigh* Forget it. Luck doesn't smile on idiots like me... Wait. Goldman didn't come knocking at your door, did he?
Traveler: No.
Yves: Good, then. Me getting beat up? Totally fine. But I would never want to get you in trouble with him.
Yves: I didn't tell him about your salvage work, but I suspect that someone else found out and told him...
Yves: Still, I will need your help today again. My divesuit still hasn't been fixed, but Goldman's been pushing me to make up for the days where I was unable to finish work...
Yves: I had no choice but to borrow someone else's divesuit, but even so, I couldn't finish my work quickly enough... Unfortunately, I'm gonna have to rely on your goodwill again.
Traveler: No issue.
Yves: Thank you. I'll mark the locations of the objects in question for you — we'll split up and search.
Traveler: Allow me.
Traveler: If he did come to me, I'd have a lesson to teach him.
Yves: Please, don't get involved with that shameless lump of lard! Someone as honorable as yourself shouldn't even be acquainted with him!
