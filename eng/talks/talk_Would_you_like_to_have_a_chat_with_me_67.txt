Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Dehya: Gladly, beats standing here twiddling my thumbs.
Dehya: Hmm... Hey, do you know about the siltwater lakes in the desert?
Traveler: Are they like the ones at Sobek Oasis?
Dehya: Uh, not exactly.
Dehya: Siltwater lakes usually appear farther inside the desert. According to some very tall tales, they're believed to be Al-Ahmar's blessings.
Dehya: Legend has it that when his followers got lost in the desert, Al-Ahmar would command the underground rivers to rise to the surface, forming lakes for the trapped to quench their thirst...
Dehya: But it's just an urban legend.
Dehya: The water in siltwater lakes does originate from groundwater, but it's too bitter to be used for drinking.
Dehya: Besides, these lakes only exist for a short time before they're buried by sand, so you can't use them as landmarks.
Traveler: So do they have any purpose?
Dehya: I heard that the Adventurers' Guild did once receive a commission related to siltwater lakes.
Dehya: As for what the commission was about... I guess some outlanders who were visiting Sumeru wanted to visit the desert and see these lakes for themselves.
Dehya: So, they hired a group of experienced Guild adventurers to escort them through the desert.
Dehya: After that... Well, some say the Adventurers' Guild has never accepted similar commissions ever since.
Traveler: Other than being treated as tourist attractions...
