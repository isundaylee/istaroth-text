Traveler: Is there anything of note nearby?

## Talk

Ahoeitu: Let me think... The temperature of the hot spring should be pretty ideal right now. Fancy a dip?

## Talk

Ahoeitu: Yeah, it's about time to replace some old equipment...

## Talk

Traveler: What sort of equipment?
Ahoeitu: Ah, I'm talking about clothes and tools that can withstand very high temperatures. Our tribespeople need them to conduct regular inspections deep within the volcano.
Ahoeitu: Koholasaurs are the only Saurians here that can traverse molten lava, so it falls on us to monitor the activities of the volcano.
Ahoeitu: The volcano has always been known for accidents and mishaps, and remains a vulnerable spot for monster attacks. They could come in from both inside and out, so it's the least we can do to keep a close eye on it.

Ahoeitu: The battle with the Abyss took its toll on us all. I've been resting and recouping for quite some time. In the meantime, a series of crises has depleted much of our equipment stores.
Ahoeitu: But it's not all bad. Equipment can be replaced. As long as the will to prevail stays strong, there's no crisis that can't be overcome.
