Traveler: How do you like it here?
Collei: Yeah, it's pretty nice. Great place to rest and recuperate.
Collei: It's actually quite normal for Forest Rangers to rough it out in the wild sometimes.
Collei: And during my wandering days, having a tent to keep the wind out was a luxury.
Collei: But still... I do prefer places with plenty of vegetation. It's nice being surrounded by constant reminders of the temerity of life.
Traveler: Wait... do you mean the "tenacity" of life...?
Collei: Huh!? "Tâ€”Tenacity"? Wait, is it?
Collei: I'm sorry, I only heard Master Tighnari say it once before... he said he likes living somewhere that is a testament to the... tenacity of life.
Traveler: So shall I plant some more trees?
Collei: No need! It's great as it is.
Collei: If you're gonna live somewhere for the long term, the most important thing to consider is how it makes you feel.
Collei: I really like it here. Thank you so much for inviting me.
