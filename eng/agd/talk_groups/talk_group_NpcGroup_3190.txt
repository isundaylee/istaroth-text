## Talk

Murata: Here's the official Yae Publishing House stall! Come check it out!

## Talk

Traveler: I'm looking to buy some books.
Murata: Take your pick! We've got all sorts of new books here at the Irodori Festival!

## Talk

Traveler: How's the festival going?
Murata: This Irodori Festival is different from ones in years past. I imagine that it's quite the sight for our guests.
Murata: That said, I'm just here to collect the Mora, give out the change, thank people for their patronage... the works.
Murata: Ah, sorry, no time for chit-chat. If Hirayama catches me, I'll be in hot stew for sure!

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Murata: Yes, please come again!

## Talk

Murata: This is the official Yae Publishing House booth, but we're still setting it all up. We'll only open once the Irodori Festival starts.

## Talk

Traveler: How's the festival going?
Murata: Oh, things have been going quite smoothly. Everyone in the editorial team has finally been able to heave a sigh of relief.
Murata: Although the release event has ended, the festival will continue for a while more. I believe that there's also ongoing ikebana and Theater Mechanicus events...
Murata: I'd have gone to take part in them myself if I didn't have to stay here to watch the booth.
