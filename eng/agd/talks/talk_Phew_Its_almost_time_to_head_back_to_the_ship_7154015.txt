Beidou: Phew... It's almost time to head back to the ship.
Traveler: Beidou, this gift envelope is for you.
Beidou: Haha, not too shabby! I like the style, and nice penmanship!
Beidou: #Looks like your skill with a pen is just as good as your skill with a blade, Traveler!
Traveler: I'm just glad that everyone is safe.
Beidou: Haha, with your help, that's practically a guarantee!
Beidou: I'm not the only one impressed by your feats. My crew is dying to have a drink with you.
Traveler: My tolerance isn't that high, I fear...
Beidou: Don't worry — I already got 'em off your back.
Beidou: You're fierce on the battlefield. But, when it comes to alcohol, my crew would drink you under the table.
Beidou: Still, you should join us for a meal when you're free — I'll host.
Beidou: In the meantime... I've gotta get back to the ship. I just received payment from the Tianquan, so it's time to divide it among the crew.
Beidou: Once I do that, I'll start prepping our feast! I'll be in touch.
Beidou: No backing out, you hear?
Traveler: See you around.
Beidou: See ya! I'll get everything ready for the feast, so no backing out!
