An aromatic rice dish. Stir-fry the meat such that it is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Then stew it with condiments and long-grain rice. Sprinkle a few Padisarah petals before serving. Every grain is saturated with the aroma of fatty meat and condiments. The dish has an exquisite taste only found in Sumeru.
