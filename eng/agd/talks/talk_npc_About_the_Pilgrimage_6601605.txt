Traveler: About the Pilgrimage...
Karpa: The Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame is where contestants may win ultimate glory. All the people of Natlan are welcome to take part.
Karpa: The Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame is held as needed in response to the Abyssal threat. As the incursions have grown worse in recent years, it's been held more frequently.
Karpa: But considering the heavy losses that the Abyss suffered during the conflict, I think it's safe to say that the Pilgrimage can be postponed for a while.
Karpa: The Abyss hasn't gone for good though, so it's best to stay prepared. In the name of victory, may you all keep fighting until the very end.
Karpa: Just remember, you must never foment conflict for its own sake. All malicious acts will be laid bare under the Pyro Archon's vigilant gaze.
