Traveler: Hold on, about this drum...
Genta: You noticed it too, huh? Yeah, I noticed almost straight away that something wasn't quite right.
Genta: It looks exactly like the kind of toy drum I'd buy from street peddlers as a kid! I remember they only cost around 800 Mora back then.
Genta: Times change, I guess, but still. 80 grand is way too expensive.
Genta: The boss definitely got scammed, no question.
Genta: But whaddya gonna do? He's still the boss.
Genta: Are you ready for your Drumalong performance?

Traveler: Hold on, about Arataki Itto...
Genta: You wanna know when Boss is getting back? Sorry, I have no idea.
Genta: What I do know is that the boss and Shinobu both see this festival as a major event, so they hope to get as many people to come as possible. That's why they're out there working hard to promote it.
Genta: They said this will improve the image of the Arataki Gang, but I wouldn't know anything about that kind of thing.
Genta: Still, I think he'll be back to see you before it's over.
Genta: After all, he respects you a lot.
Genta: Are you ready for your Drumalong performance?

Genta: Oh, you wanna take part in the Drumalong performance again?

### Talk 1 related talk 0

Traveler: Yes please.
Genta: I wanna see your performance again, too, but the Tenryou Commission has ordered us to put everything on hold. You're putting me in a difficult position here...
Genta: Ooh, I know! Since it's you, we can say we're friends hanging out and having fun.
Genta: The Tenryou Commission won't be able to say anything against that, hahahaha!
Genta: This is a pretty genius idea, isn't it? I mean, at least half as genius as Boss's ideas?
Genta: Bring it on, Traveler! Begin your performance.
