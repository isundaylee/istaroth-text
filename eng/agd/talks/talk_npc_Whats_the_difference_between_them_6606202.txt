Traveler: What's the difference between them?
Mataoho: Ah, the main difference is the temperature. The artificial hot springs we built for the tourists are usually quite a bit cooler, so it won't be a problem even if you were to soak in there for a whole day.
Mataoho: Compared to that, there are far less ways to control the temperature of the natural pools. Usually, you'll only find the heat-loving Koholasaurs playing in there.
Mataoho: Of course, there are always those who love the top temps, or just want to challenge themselves. You can sometimes find those "experts" swimming with the Saurians.
Mataoho: I have a lot of respect for them, but what they do is not for the faint of heart... and definitely not for outlanders.
