# Ah, Fresh Meat!


## Talk 1

Harris: Just a few more ingredients to go...
Traveler: What's happening?
Harris: Hmm? Ah, Traveler. I'm just adding the finishing touches to an ancient recipe.
Harris: Not long ago, a team of explorers went on an expedition into the mountains. One of them is a friend of mine, an adventurer.
Harris: They didn't make it very far due to bad weather conditions. But, my friend did tell me that they happened upon an ancient ruin while they were taking shelter from the storm.
Harris: It was full of books and other records. Even... even a recipe. I don't know how it has survived intact for this long...
Harris: My adventurer friend passed the recipe on to me. He hopes I can revive the taste of the past.
Harris: In fact, I've never even heard of some of the ingredients that the recipe requires. Even some of the cooking techniques are new to me.
Harris: So, I'm cooking a modified version which only uses the most essential ingredients...
Harris: Would you be willing to help me gather the unusual ingredients from the recipe?
Traveler: Leave it to me!
Harris: Nice to see you're so enthusiastic about this.
Harris: I heard that a few boar somehow got lost in the mountains and became encased in ice... I'm curious to find out how such an ordeal affects the flavor of the meat.
Harris: So, perhaps you could fetch me ten portions of Chilled Meat.
Traveler: To clarify, you mean...
Harris: Yes, as in the meat of those frozen boar. Being encased in ice must keep it pretty fresh, don't you think? So, when someone tells me about some poor boar trapped in the ice, all I hear is "Chilled Meat"...
Harris: Thanks for doing this for me. Come and find me once you've got the ingredients.
Traveler: What ingredients do you need?

## Talk 2

Traveler: Here's your Chilled Meat.
Harris: Wow, this Chilled Meat looks pretty good to me... Now I just have one more ingredient left to find.
Harris: Have you heard of the Great Snowboar King? People say that it's a fierce beast dwelling deep in the mountains...
Harris: ...And recipes say that its exquisite meat is well-suited to any method of cooking...
Harris: Traveler, would you kindly run this errand for me?
Traveler: Could I boldly inquire what's in it for me?
Harris: Don't worry, I have set something aside ready for your return.

## Talk 3

Traveler: Here's your Chilled Meat.
Harris: Wow, this Chilled Meat looks pretty good to me... Now I just have one more ingredient left to find.
Harris: Have you heard of the Great Snowboar King? People say that it's a fierce beast dwelling deep in the mountains...
Harris: ...And recipes say that its exquisite meat is well-suited to any method of cooking...
Traveler: Huh... You mean, this?
Harris: What? Wait... Yes! How... Where? Is this pure coincidence, or...
Harris: ...Well, anyway... This means I now have all the ingredients I need.
Harris: While I was waiting for you to get back with the ingredients, I formalized my recipe. If one thing's certain, it's that this is definitely a far cry from the ancient recipe I started with...
Harris: But as long as the end result tastes good, I'm not concerned about how I get there. I think I'm going to name this dish "Goulash." Sounds exotic but it's very easy to make... Why don't you try for yourself?
Harris: Don't worry, I've factored in the difficulty of trying to cook in an inhospitable environment like this. So I kept the preparation time to a minimum and made sure the cooking method is a straightforward one.
Harris: Go on, give it a try. After you've made it once, you'll find it's easy to remember if you ever want to cook it again.

## Talk 4

Traveler: About the Great Snowboar King meat you wanted...
Harris: Ah, you've managed to get your hands on some Great Snowboar King meat, have you?
Traveler: Here you are.
Harris: Well, in that case... That's all the ingredients accounted for.
Harris: While I was waiting for you to get back with the ingredients, I formalized my recipe. If one thing's certain, it's that this is definitely a far cry from the ancient recipe I started with...
Harris: But as long as the end result tastes good, I'm not concerned about how I get there. I think I'm going to name this dish "Goulash." Sounds exotic but it's very easy to make... Why don't you try for yourself?

## Talk 5

Harris: Delicious! Nice one, you're a natural.
Harris: Thanks for your help, and please accept these in return. I need to go cook for some other people now.
Harris: Oh, one last thing â€” come and see me again this evening, I'll give you another batch of this food.
Harris: If you're going to go adventuring in the mountains, you've got to make sure you eat right!

## Talk 6

Traveler: I made some Goulash.
Harris: Ah! You've finished?

## Talk 7

Harris: About the ingredients...
Harris: *sigh* The right ingredients are so hard to find...

## Talk 8

Harris: About the ingredients...
Harris: Hmm... Now, what to do with these ingredients...

## Talk 9

Traveler: I've come for my Goulash.
Harris: Right on time! It's all ready. Here you go, as promised.
Harris: Do eat it while it's hot. Remember, hot food is your adventure fuel.
