# Idle Teapot Talk

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Ah, you arrived quickly. Good, good.
Traveler: What's up?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): I asked you to come here so I could give you a little gift.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): I do not know if I told you before, but these abodes are private spaces created by the adepti for themselves.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Most adepti will use certain methods to seal their abode away from the rest of the world to ensure its purity and avoid being disturbed.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Afterward, adepti would create a "Realm Dispatch" for those they wished to invite into their abode.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): This Realm Dispatch bears signatures of the abode's adeptal energy and that of the adeptus themselves. As such, anyone who has this dispatch can enter or exit the abode freely.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Before, this abode was in an incomplete, embryonic state. Those whom you invited into it would only have been able to exit and enter together with you, rather than remain for long periods.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): But now... Well, take this Realm Dispatch that I have created for you and hold it in your hand â€” tightly, now.
Traveler: What should I do next?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Don't worry. You need only hold this dispatch, and it will draw some of your energy out and into it.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Ah yes. I heard Ping mention that you have made friends in a great many places. As such, I suspect that were we to distribute one dispatch to each one of them, we would be here making dispatches for a long time.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): As such, I have made some modifications to this dispatch. All you need to do is tap the palm of the person you'd like to invite lightly with the dispatch, and your energy signature will remain on them, allowing them to enter and leave your realm with ease.
Traveler: Huh, it's almost like "marking," isn't it...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Huh? Well, sort of? But why did you have to put it so weirdly...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Ahem, well, here is the Realm Dispatch. Go forth and invite whoever you wish.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): It seems that this place shall become lively quite soon...
Traveler: I thought it needed some of my energies...
Traveler: You're not going to ask me for help with something again, are you...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Hmm? No, of course not. Why was that your first reaction...?
