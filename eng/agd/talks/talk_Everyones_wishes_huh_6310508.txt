Traveler: Everyone's wishes, huh...
Inagi Hotomi: Yes... I've been in charge of greeting the people coming here for fortune slips for a while now, and I have heard all sorts of wishes from all manner of people.
Inagi Hotomi: Many have come lately to thank the Electro Archon for abolishing the country's closing, and to pray for a flourishing business or safe travels.
Inagi Hotomi: As a shrine maiden, I should always follow and serve the Electro Archon. My life for the Eternal Narukami.
