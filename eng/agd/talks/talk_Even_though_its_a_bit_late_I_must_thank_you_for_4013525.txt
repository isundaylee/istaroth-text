# Talk Dialog

Chevreuse: Even though it's a bit late, I must thank you for investigating this case with me.
Chevreuse: Not on behalf of the Special Patrol this time — it's a personal expression of gratitude from yours truly.
Traveler: About your family...
Chevreuse: Ah, you want to hear more about my father?
Chevreuse: To be honest, I didn't spend that much time with him. He was always busy with the Special Patrol, so he would often return home really late at night. Some nights, he didn't come home at all.
Chevreuse: Once, he didn't come home for a long time. Maybe a whole week or so.
Chevreuse: When I went out to buy food, I learned that he had become a criminal, and by extension, that made me a criminal's daughter.
Chevreuse: But we can talk about that another day.
Traveler: About the case...
Chevreuse: I actually have a lot of sympathy for Veronique and Baptiste. I can understand the hatred they feel for their father...
Chevreuse: But that doesn't mean I'll allow them to walk the path of evil, even if it might lead to another sense of justice.
Traveler: About the film...
Chevreuse: Films are different from the real world. They are a form of art and represent the wishes in people's hearts.
Chevreuse: I adore "The Two Musketeers," and I'm very happy to have had the opportunity to act the role as one.
Chevreuse: I can't wait to catch the film when it premieres in the opera house. I'm looking forward to seeing the audience's reaction to the climactic ending.
Traveler: Please take care...
Chevreuse: Thank you for looking out for me. I'll see you at the award ceremony — I'd be very surprised if we don't win.
