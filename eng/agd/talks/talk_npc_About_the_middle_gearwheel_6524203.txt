Traveler: About the middle gearwheel...
Camden: Oh, that... That's, uh, an old issue from way back when.
Camden: Just don't go touching it. I don't want my whole world to start spinning while I'm enjoying a proper snooze...
Camden: Heh. I just mean, if you do move it make sure you don't accidentally trap anyone. It's happened before.
Camden: Not that creatures like humans will ever learn from their mistakes, of course.
