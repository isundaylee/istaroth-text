Traveler: What is this place?
Maryam: This is the Gilded Journey, and I'm the owner of this hotel.
Maryam: Don't worry, I won't demand an exorbitant price just because I own the only hotel in Caravan Ribat. So, please rest at ease.
Maryam: Of course, you can also rent a room from a local or a traveling researcher around here.
Maryam: But because this place is a pitstop, the people that come here... It's a mixed bag. So, keep your eyes wide open when you're selecting a place to stay.
