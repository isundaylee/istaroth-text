Quest Test NPC: Hey! Traveler!
Quest Test NPC: It's dangerous ahead! Don't go that way!
Traveler: ...What's wrong?
Quest Test NPC: The roads ahead are dangerous â€” a convoy was attacked by powerful monsters in the mountain pass.
Quest Test NPC: We better leave if we have no business here.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Quest Test NPC: Take care.

Quest Test NPC: In front of you is the danger zone... Huh? Could you possibly be...
Traveler: ...What's wrong?
Quest Test NPC: Your attire... Could you be the traveler they spoke of?
Quest Test NPC: Huh? You don't? Your heroic deeds have already spread across Mondstadt. I heard that it was you who put an end to the storms that terrorized Mondstadt!
Quest Test NPC: Though I believe you're capable of dealing with the monsters ahead, I'd still like to ask you to watch out and take care.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Quest Test NPC: Take care.
