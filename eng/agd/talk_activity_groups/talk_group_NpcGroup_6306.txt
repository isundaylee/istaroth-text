"Dopey Dazzler": Alright! Once we finish the next graffiti piece, it's off to Frida's Palette to try out new color combinations!

Traveler: Graffiti?
"Dopey Dazzler": It's those paintings you see on cliffs, walls, and the ground everywhere here in Natlan. It's our local art form, and it's only popular here!
"Dopey Dazzler": Huh? Feels like I've seen you somewhere before! I can't quite remember where, though... Wonder if that's a residual effect of the accident before.
"Dopey Dazzler": I was painting a cliffside when I accidentally snapped the safety line and hit my head in the fall...
"Dopey Dazzler": Was laid up in bed, my head all swathed in bandages, for three months before making a recovery. And even now, I still feel pretty dizzy...

Traveler: Color combinations?
"Dopey Dazzler": Yeah. Bold lines and visually stimulating colors are key to graffiti.
"Dopey Dazzler": However, my observations indicate that the human eye is more likely to notice large blocks of vibrant color at a certain distance...
"Dopey Dazzler": That means we're first drawn in by a color before we consider its outline.
"Dopey Dazzler": Therefore, a combination of colors that leaves people feeling brighter with a single glance — full of vitality, even! — is crucial to how some graffiti "grabs" the eye.
"Dopey Dazzler": If you're interested in color combos, swing around for a chat anytime!

Traveler: Well, I shan't bother you, then.
"Dopey Dazzler": All good, all good. Safe travels!

Traveler: Take care of yourself!
"Dopey Dazzler": Sure! Graffiti's key, but I should probably steer clear of accidents if I want to make anything truly great, eh?
"Dopey Dazzler": The Scions of the Canopy really have advantages when it comes to high-altitude work. Gah, I'm so envious!
"Dopey Dazzler": But putting aside all this stuff for now...
"Dopey Dazzler": You've got a radiant complexion, keen senses, distinguished temperament, and a unique sense of geniality...
"Dopey Dazzler": If you join this line of work, you'll definitely have what it takes to be the vanguard of avant-garde — a rising star amongst graffiti artists!
"Dopey Dazzler": If you're interested, you can follow me, the Dopey Dazzler, in grasping the latest and greatest in trendy artistic thought!
"Dopey Dazzler": I will teach you everything I know, without reservation!
