Traveler: Are you gazing at the sea?
Adel: At the sea? No, no... I'm an officer of the law, from the Akademiya. Everyone calls me Master Adel.
Adel: Simply put, it is the job of the Navbed to inspect a port's comings and goings. I inspect them in turn.
Adel: You can think of me as their superior.

Traveler: Youngsters heading out to sea?
Adel: Indeed! I mean, look at them, all fired up like that.

Traveler: But you were clearly gazing out to sea...
Adel: *cough* I was simply keeping an eye on the ships out at sea. Gotta make sure the Navbed aren't slacking off and all.

Adel: It's almost as if... their souls were forged for battle from birth.
Adel: Don't mistake my meaning, they aren't barbarians! On the contrary, they love street graffiti, showing off and comparing fashionable trinkets...
Adel: It's a colorful, contradictory, charming place.
Adel: Come to think of it, I'm practically getting younger over here, and yet our head administrator's always using "you need more rest" as an excuse to leave me idle.
Adel: *cough*...
