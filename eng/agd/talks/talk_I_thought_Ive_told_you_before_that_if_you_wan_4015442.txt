Gorou: ...I thought I've told you before, that if you want to pass through the forest undetected, you're gonna want to wet your tails. Wet fur doesn't get snagged on branches and twigs as easily as dry fur. You'll be able to slip on by, and your enemies will be none the wiser...
Kirara: Nuh-uh, that's not gonna happen. I can't stand my tails wet. I'd be better off... tying them in a knot or something â€” or better yet, improving my fighting skills so that I don't have to sneak by them in the first place...
Kirara: Oh, you're here! How's the potion coming?
Traveler: Hand over the potion...
Traveler: It's still in development.
Gorou: Well, I'm rooting for you! I've seen how capable you are. No way a few alchemical roadblocks can stand in your way!
