Traveler: Having fun on the beach?
Will: Yep! The scenery is soooo different from Mondstadt.
Will: I even caught a fish! Fish skin is slippery, so they're super hard to catch... Well, harder than catching crabs anyway. That's what Jill does.
Will: But anyway, I don't have a bowl to put this fish in. So why don't you take it?
