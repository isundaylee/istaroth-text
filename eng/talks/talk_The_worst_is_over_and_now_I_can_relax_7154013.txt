# Talk Dialog

Ningguang: The worst is over, and now... I can relax.
Traveler: Ningguang, this gift envelope is for you.
Ningguang: Thank you. Ah, just as expected — it's exquisite!
Ningguang: The fetor problem could have had grave consequences. But, thanks to you and Director Hu, we were able to resolve it without issue.
Ningguang: Allow me to thank you again on behalf of all Liyue Harbor.
Ningguang: Many in this world claim to be heroic, but it takes a true hero to step forward in times of crisis.
Ningguang: Liyue Harbor is truly fortunate to have received the help of so many heroes.
Ningguang: ...Anyway, I won't force you to listen to my compliments any longer. I want you to actually enjoy the festivities — that includes the food, too.
Ningguang: The crisis is over, so take it easy and make the most of the festival.
Traveler: See you.
Ningguang: Goodbye. I hope you a have a relaxing Lantern Rite.
