Kamisato Ayaka: Stories from other lands are something new and precious to me. I cherish the opportunity to read them during our rest time. I hope I can finish them.
Kamisato Ayaka: Look at the wonderful printing, and the beautiful illustrations...
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh! Could we read some stories together? Only if you want, of course. There's a lot of interesting details I want to share with you.
