Yurika: Welcome, dear guest. Welcome to the Outlander Affairs Agency.
Yurika: You can sign up here to set up a fan work booth at the Irodori Festival, and guests may also certify their family members to arrange for their food and board.
Yurika: Of course, the usual store and residency permits will still be processed as always.
Yurika: Also... Don't forget about the handling fee.
