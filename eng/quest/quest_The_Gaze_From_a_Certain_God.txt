# The Gaze From a Certain God


## Talk 1

Tashfin: Hold it right there.
Tashfin: #A {M#blond}{F#blonde}-haired traveler and a floating fairy... We've got you, alright. Take a look around — you've fallen right into our trap.
Paimon: Ah! Are you mercenaries from the Corps of Thirty? Did you come here to arrest us?
Tashfin: Corps of Thirty? We're nothing like those government lapdogs who don't even get scraps for their work.
Tashfin: We are an elite brigade that commands the highest commission rate in all of Sumeru. We're here on the orders of a client known only as "The Outcast."
Paimon: "The Outcast"... An outcast from the Akademiya?
Traveler: Sounds like The Doctor.
Paimon: But why wouldn't The Doctor just send the Fatui after us?
Traveler: Local mercenaries might have an edge over the Fatui.
Tashfin: Hmph, still wasting time on idle chit-chat? We'll shut you up soon enough. Get them!
Paimon: #You're up, {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: Maybe he's taking advantage of the Akademiya's resources.

## Talk 2

Paimon: That was pretty rough... Is that what elite mercenaries are like?
Traveler: It probably won't be long before we see more of them.
Paimon: Yeah, looks like we'll have to keep our guards up.
Paimon: But this Doctor guy seems like a pretty tough opponent... He knew exactly where to set up an ambush. Did he predict that we would try to find Tighnari?
Paimon: Ugh, going up against smart people is tough... Anyway, let's keep going.

## Talk 3

Collei: Oh, it's the Traveler and Paimon! What are you two doing back here?
Paimon: Collei, it's nice to see you again! Are you doing alright?
Collei: I... To be honest, I'm not doing too well. My Eleazar has been progressing at a faster rate lately. I'm finding it harder to complete more intricate tasks.
Collei: As a result, Master Tighnari has taken me off the patrol schedule. He will only allow me to stay here and coordinate other people's tasks.
Paimon: Oh, Collei...
Traveler: It seems that curing Irminsul is our only chance...
Paimon: Speaking of Tighnari, did he go off on patrol? We're here to talk to him!
Collei: Oh, Master Tighnari? He just left the Avidya Forest a little while ago. He was headed to Pardis Dhyai.
Paimon: Huh, he left? But... isn't Tighnari always saying that he never wants to leave the Avidya Forest? He even turned down the sages' invitation.
Collei: I thought it was weird, too... Master Tighnari always prioritizes his work as a Forest Watcher above everything. He almost never leaves his post. He left in a hurry this time, though...
Paimon: He didn't give a reason?
Collei: No, I only found out that he left through a message he left behind. He also made sure to delegate all his tasks using a schedule.
Collei: To leave in such a hurry... I'd guess he had something urgent to take care of.
Paimon: You mentioned that he was going to Pardis Dhyai... What kind of place is that?
Collei: Hm... Master Tighnari originally studied in the Amurta Darshan of the Akademiya, and Pardis Dhyai is something like the Amurta's research base. Many rare shrubs and grasses have been planted there for research.
Collei: I know that before he became a Forest Watcher, Master Tighnari once spent a long time conducting research at Pardis Dhyai.
Paimon: A research base, huh... Gotta wonder what kind of research Tighnari just decided to work on all of a sudden...
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, we don't have a lot of time, so let's go look for him at Pardis Dhyai.
Traveler: Please take care of yourself, Collei.
Collei: Ah... Don't worry, I'm fine. I'm used to living with Eleazar by now! If you run into Master Tighnari, please send him my regards.
Paimon: Got it, will do! See you later, Collei!
Traveler: Don't push yourself too hard, Collei.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Wait, look who it is...!
Traveler: Nahida!
Paimon: Thank goodness, you're okay! We were so worried about you...
Traveler: You ARE Nahida, right?
Paimon: #Hey {NICKNAME}! This was supposed to be a touching reunion, but you're ruining the moment!
Nahida: Actually, it's very smart of the Traveler to be wary of me right now. After all, The Doctor has shown that his technology can apparently even control human minds...
Nahida: Plus, it's not like you could've known what happened after we split up, and I was facing The Doctor by myself.
Nahida: Even a pool of stagnant water after a torrential storm can occasionally pass as a patch of sky.
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon feels like only the real Nahida could come up with such an obscure analogy.
Traveler: I agree.
Nahida: Huh? But I wasn't trying to win your trust or anything. All I wanted was to clarify my point...
Paimon: Well, we understand that point now! Please, Nahida, tell us more about what happened. Are those poor people alright?
Nahida: When you left, I was still in the middle of restoring everyone's minds. Thankfully, when The Doctor mentioned "depositing information into the subconscious," he didn't mean engraving information into their minds...
Nahida: ...Instead, he did something closer to creating hallucinations. That was still within my power to fix.
Nahida: Luckily, I managed to finish my restorations and mind-jump away from him just as he was about to capture me.
Paimon: Whew, what a relief... The Doctor sure pulled out some hidden cards, but good thing we had Nahida with us...
Nahida: I wouldn't be relieved just yet.
Nahida: I gave away my true identity when I restored everyone's minds, which means we've lost another one of our trump cards.
Nahida: Also... The Doctor is already an expert at modifying Akasha Terminals. Maybe it's only a matter of time until he captures my consciousness inside the Akasha.
Paimon: Would that mean you'd no longer be able to jump between minds? Then, how do we stop him... He's still at the Akademiya, so it's possible he's already started messing with the Akasha...
Traveler: We need to hurry.
Paimon: Argh, it feels like he's toying with us! What a nasty piece of work!
Paimon: Plus, The Doctor's combat ability alone is apparently enough to make him worthy of being number two of the Fatui...
Nahida: We shouldn't give up hope just yet. Let's try to find another way to attack this problem.
Paimon: Actually, Nahida, how did you know we were trying to get to Pardis Dhyai? Have you been waiting for us?
Nahida: #Yes, I have. I can see {NICKNAME}'s Elemental Energy, so I deduced your destination by looking at the direction you were moving in.
Nahida: You didn't come here for sightseeing, right? Did you find any leads?
Paimon: We're looking for a scholar we know! His name is Tighnari, and the sages once tried to reach out to him. Why don't you come inside with us and see what we can find?
Nahida: Okay. Let's just hope we won't get him into trouble...
Traveler: Our position will only get worse with time.
Traveler: I believe you.
Traveler: You haven't been reprogrammed by The Doctor, have you?
Traveler: Katheryne!

## Talk 5

Haypasia: Traveler? It is you!
Paimon: Ah! It's Haypasia!
Traveler: Long time no see!
Haypasia: Ahh, what a pleasant surprise! It's so nice to see the two of you again.
Nahida: Who's this...?
Paimon: She's a scholar we met in the Avidya Forest! When we last saw each other, she was still training in the uh, what's it called... "Satyavada Life"?
Nahida: Oh... I see.
Haypasia: That's right, we're old friends! You've come at just the right time. Ever since I've come here, hardly anyone has even talked to me.
Paimon: Haypasia, you're way too excited about this! Actually, for you to leave the Avidya Forest means... you're not in training anymore?
Paimon: Wait, no... Did you already finish your training and reach Paripurna Life?
Haypasia: Hehehe... What do you think?
Haypasia: My consciousness... has already managed to make contact with the divine.
Nahida: ...Hmm?
Paimon: You did it!? Congratulations!
Traveler: I'm really happy for you.
Haypasia: Haha, it's so exhilarating to share this sublime joy with others at long last!
Haypasia: When my consciousness made contact with the gods... What a supreme and unparalleled experience that was...
Paimon: That sounds incredible...
Traveler: Actually, we're here for Tighnari...
Haypasia: Oh, alright... Actually, please wait — I haven't forgotten my promise to you.
Haypasia: Remember? I promised to help you understand what you saw from Irminsul once I gained deeper insights.
Haypasia: My current self has not only gained true insight, but I can even help you establish a direct connection to the consciousness of the divine!
Paimon: Y—You can do that?
Traveler: Do you believe her, Nahida?
Nahida: I've never heard of anything like that, but... if you want to give it a try, I'll do my best to protect your consciousness during the process.
Haypasia: Hold on, I've brought some Spirit Borneol with me. This is still a crucial part of the ceremony.
Paimon: Uh, we're using that incense again?
Haypasia: Alright, now... hold my hand. I'll help you establish a pathway to connect your consciousness.
Nahida: Okay.
Haypasia: Ready?
Paimon: Wh—What was that!
Traveler: This is neither the Greater Lord's consciousness...
Paimon: Did we actually just see the Balladeer's memories!? Everything matches what we know about him!
Paimon: But how is he connected to the divine consciousness that Haypasia was talking about!?
Haypasia: You saw it, right? You felt it, right!? Such a majestic god, such a noble will, such sublime emotion!
Haypasia: Alas, a shame... If only...
Haypasia: If only that which beats within my chest wasn't a filthy, mortal heart... O great and merciful god, please grant me forgiveness and salvation...
Nahida: Do you understand now? I'm afraid this is no Paripurna Life, but rather...
Traveler: Wake up, Haypasia!
Haypasia: Ah...!
Haypasia: You... Why are you so mean to me? Why is everyone hiding from me?
Haypasia: I found divine wisdom! Shouldn't I receive praise and honor? Haven't I uncovered that light in the darkness?
Paimon: Haypasia...
Haypasia: That's how I always thought everything should be...
Haypasia: ...Wait...
Haypasia: Have I... already lost my mind?
Traveler: ...
Nahida: Wait, something isn't right!
Traveler: Nor King Deshret's consciousness...
Traveler: We're in a hurry, so let's chat about this next time.
Traveler: You're truly amazing!
Traveler: Didn't expect to run into you here.

## Talk 6

Paimon: ...Okay, we've finally lost them.
Traveler: !!!
Paimon: #Are you okay, Nahida? ...Wait, no! Something feels different... {NICKNAME}, you're back!?
Tighnari: #Oh? {NICKNAME}'s back?
Traveler: It's me...
Paimon: Nahida was controlling your body for a while. It seems like she jumped over to you as an emergency measure right before the Katheryne puppet was destroyed.
Paimon: After that... Tighnari heard the commotion and came over. He helped us defeat the mercenaries, and then he ran with us all the way here.
Traveler: This time, she didn't just transfer her mind into my body...
Paimon: What? You swapped places? You mean, your consciousness also went into Nahida's body?
Paimon: Wait, then where is Nahida's consciousness? Where is she now...?
Tighnari: I never imagined that an individual's consciousness could be transferred around like this... Had I not seen it with my own eyes, I would have never believed it. I don't think this can be achieved with current human technology...
Tighnari: #Also, {NICKNAME}, while we were running, the consciousness in your body told me to pass on a message. She said:
Tighnari: "The Doctor has found a way to trap my consciousness, so I can't journey with you anymore."
Tighnari: "But even in a moonless night, a shower of starlight can still drown out illusions and lies."
Paimon: Aaagh, oh no... Nahida's trapped in the Sanctuary of Surasthana for good this time!
Paimon: Was that message all she left for us? It's pretty vague...
Traveler: It's in a code that only we know.
Paimon: Oh, that makes sense! Since The Doctor captured her, she won't be able to say anything without him knowing. She's being extra careful...
Paimon: "Even in a moonless night, a shower of starlight can still drown out illusions and lies..."
Paimon: Paimon knows that the Moon, illusions, and lies are from that alchemical divination at the Sabzeruz Festival...
Paimon: Didn't Nahida use a "starlight" analogy before? It had something to do with Setaria...
Traveler: "The Moon" refers to Nahida herself.
Paimon: Ohhh! That makes a lot of sense. Do you think Nahida was telling us to go find help in the desert?
Paimon: But she isn't with us anymore... Think we'll be okay?
Tighnari: #Paimon... you said Sanctuary of Surasthana, correct? Does this mean that this "Nahida" you're talking about, the consciousness who was occupying {NICKNAME}'s body... is... the Dendro Archon?
Paimon: Uh... Your guess is correct, but the situation's a bit complicated, so it's really hard for us to explain right now...
Tighnari: That's alright. A scholar's curiosity doesn't need to be appeased right away. As for the complicated nature of the situation... Safe to say, I have witnessed that for myself.
Tighnari: I've spent some time with you, and it looks like the Dendro Archon's also on your side, so... I trust you.
Paimon: Thank you, Tighnari! Oh, actually, we came here to ask you a question. What do you know about the project that the sages have been working on?
Tighnari: Ah, that... While I was indeed invited to join that project, the sages were always secretive about its scope and goals, so I eventually declined.
Tighnari: All I know is that that project has something to do with the restoration of Irminsul.
Traveler: I think I know what the project is about.
Paimon: Eh? Did you see something when you were in Nahida's body?
Traveler: The Akademiya is... turning The Balladeer into a god.
Paimon: What!?
Tighnari: ...Do you have any evidence?
Traveler: I saw a "nascent god" under construction.
Tighnari: ...
Black Screen Text: You describe what you saw when you exchanged consciousnesses with Nahida...
Tighnari: Hm, so that's what happened... That explains why Haypasia's symptoms were different from those of the other scholars who went mad. It's because she made contact with the consciousness of a new god who is still in the process of being born...
Paimon: Tighnari, did you leave the Avidya Forest because of Haypasia?
Tighnari: I did. I noticed Haypasia's mental anomalies, but since her symptoms were rather atypical, I secretly took her to Pardis Dhyai, and began searching for a way to return her to her normal self.
Tighnari: If I didn't take action, Haypasia would have already been taken by the matra to the desert, doomed to a life of exile at Aaru Village.
Tighnari: Now that you mention it, I knew the Akademiya has never thought particularly highly of Lesser Lord Kusanali, but...
Tighnari: ...But I still didn't expect them to do something as arrogant as creating a new god. Looks like I made the right decision by not accepting their invitation.
Traveler: The Fatui is also behind some of this.
Tighnari: The Doctor and The Balladeer... We have two Fatui Harbingers in Sumeru... Sounds like we're in for a bad time.
Tighnari: From your description, I don't think they've completed their project. There may still be room for us to intervene.
Tighnari: But then, what is the connection between creating a new god and restoring Irminsul...?
Paimon: Yeah, it feels like we're still nowhere close to figuring out the sages' goals...
Traveler: Let's head to the desert for now.
Paimon: Right. We've pretty much gone over everything we need to know, so we should head out... How about you, Tighnari? What are you going to do?
Tighnari: I'll stay here for now. I still want to try a few more things to help Haypasia.
Tighnari: If you're planning to go into the desert, start by heading for Caravan Ribat. That'll be your fastest route.
Tighnari: Come find me here if there's anything else I can do to help. May the spirit of wisdom go with you.
Paimon: Thanks, Tighnari! Hopefully Haypasia will feel better soon! We're off, then.
Traveler: We must stop them no matter what.
Traveler: The Fatui may have fanned the flames.
Traveler: Haypasia also showed us a so-called divine consciousness...
Traveler: I just received some new intel.
Traveler: "Starlight" refers to the people of the desert.
Traveler: "Illusions and lies" refer to the Akademiya's plans.
Traveler: We can't let The Doctor figure out what we're up to.
Traveler: Our minds swapped places.
Traveler: What just happened?
Traveler: *gasp*
