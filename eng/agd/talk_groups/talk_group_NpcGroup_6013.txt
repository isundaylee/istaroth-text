Purum: I'm aware that the question I'm about to ask you will drag this out even longer.
Kwame: Okay, uhh... go ahead?
Purum: Do you have any idea how long it's been since we sat down to eat? Any at all?

Purum: The amount of time it takes you to eat a Tataco, more like! I've just about digested my whole darn meal here!
Kwame: Wow, impressive. But what's the rush? Besides, after you've just finished eating, it's always a good idea to take a rest before you set off â€” helps keep the stomachache at bay.
Purum: You're not seriously suggesting I should be thanking you, are you?
Kwame: Actually, yes, I suppose I am.
