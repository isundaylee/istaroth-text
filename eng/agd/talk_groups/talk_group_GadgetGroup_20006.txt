Osse: All you need to do to play music is activate the Autoharmonic Reed Pipes on both sides and calibrate them to match the nearby notes. That way, we can retrieve the musical score.

Traveler: Tell me about the Autoharmonic Reed Pipes...
Osse: Ah... Well, as their name implies, they are machines that can play music by themselves.
Osse: Our ancient civilization was founded upon music, and many such devices have survived to this day.
Osse: However, unlike the music box in your hands or the devices used to play the "symphony," this sort can only play a few simple chords. As such, their strength is correspondingly weaker.
Osse: We should encounter more such instruments later, but they will not prove much of an obstacle for those who can already wield the power of the "symphony" power as we do.

Traveler: Tell us about your relationship to this castle...
Osse: You've guessed it already, I reckon. In the past, when I could still change my form freely, he... and I, and many of our companions dwelled here.
Osse: In those days, a new nation had just been born, and as far as we were concerned, the possibilities were yet endless.
Osse: Here, we organized the classics, researching music theory and magic, in the hopes that we might tame this perilous power and use it to open up a brighter age.
Osse: But... These possibilities would quickly become lost to us, and I alone remained...
Traveler: Osse...
Osse: It's fine. These things happened a long time ago.
