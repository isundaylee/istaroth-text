# Stratagem Shard

A crystal that contains a deep and subtle power. Much like Cor Lapis, it has a pure Geo-gold hue. Its power can be activated to some extent within this space under The Chasm, thus helping to defeat monsters.
This can be used in the "Realms of Guile and War" of "Perilous Trails" to draw Stratagems or allow characters who have fallen to take to the field once again.
