# Talk Dialog

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Xinyan: Sure! I've got some serious writer's block... Help me think it through!
Traveler: You write your own songs?
Xinyan: Naturally!
Xinyan: In Liyue Harbor, rock 'n' roll is considered niche. There's a lot of fans of the music, but few creators of it.
Xinyan: Although I listen to songs from Fontaine, that's just appreciation and learnin'.
Xinyan: When it's time for creation, you gotta do it yourself to live up to the words "rock 'n' roll"!
Traveler: That's amazing!
Xinyan: Hehe, thanks for your appreciation.
Xinyan: But... I've been kinda worried lately.
Xinyan: For my newest song, fans say they can "hear tenderness within the searin' flames." They think my style has changed...
Xinyan: Maybe it's because of recent changes in my heart. Ugh, should I not let that happen...?
Traveler: In the past, what sort of themes did you start with?
Xinyan: Overcomin' prejudice, of course!
Xinyan: What I heard and saw in the streets, combined with my personal experiences...
Xinyan: Narration, lyrics... The most important thing is to have enough passion to question everything!
Xinyan: You gotta point right towards the soul!
Traveler: Anything on your mind lately?
Xinyan: Well...
