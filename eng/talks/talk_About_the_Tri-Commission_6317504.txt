Traveler: About the Tri-Commission...
Naoe Hisamasa: You probably already know about the three major Commissions in charge of Inazuman affairs.
Naoe Hisamasa: The Kanjou Commission, the financial arm of Inazuma. They spare no effort to increase the nation's wealth.
Naoe Hisamasa: The Yashiro Commission, the cultural representative of Inazuma. They are responsible for ceremonial affairs and celebratory events. They appear to be the commission closest to the Almighty Shogun herself, so naturally they are also the closest to the people.
Naoe Hisamasa: The Tenryou Commission, the head of public security in Inazuma. They carry out government decrees to the T... and then there's the endless tussle with the rebels of Sangonomiya.
Naoe Hisamasa: Thankfully they can't easily reassign Hatamoto's forces, otherwise we'd be dragged off to Kannazuka as well.
Naoe Hisamasa: Anyway... Hmph, as long as it is for the future of Inazuma, I wish them nothing but the best.
