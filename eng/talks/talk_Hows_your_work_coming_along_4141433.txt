# Talk Dialog

Traveler: How's your work coming along?
Albert: Oh, you mean the homework that Professor Venti gave us...
Albert: Don't worry about it! Even though preparing a gift for Barbara-sama is my top priority, creating a poem filled with passion is just as important!
Albert: Let me show you the power of a fan's heart!
Albert: "No further distance in this world below
Wider even than life and death
Than that of the Cathedral window
You within — I, outside left"
Traveler: Not bad, though it's kind of ordinary.
Albert: *sigh* It seems that you lack spirit — you still do not understand the regard in which we hold Barbara-sama.
Albert: But it's fine, you have much time ahead of you. Good luck, Traveler!
Albert: Let me give this a bit more thought and come up with a better version, and then I can submit it to Professor Venti.
Traveler: How about not peeping next time, eh?
