Delaroche: Patience, patience... This is just a test of my patience...
Delaroche: As the director of the Fishing Association, I must remain by my post here at the fishing point — I shall defeat these Linebreakers with my unbending will!

## Talk

Traveler: Never mind that for now. I'd like to purchase some fishing supplies.
Delaroche: Oh sure, of course! Take your pick!

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Delaroche: I'm the current director of the Fontaine Fishing Association, Delaroche! If you have any questions about fishing, you can come to me!
Delaroche: Ah, but I refer to fishing equipment and material. As for techniques, tips, and tricks, I shall not haphazardly instruct others.

## Talk

Traveler: You really did bring a weapon!
Delaroche: Hehe, that's right! I asked a friend at the Adventurers' Guild to procure it. Apparently, it's a foreign model...
Delaroche: While it's not as elegant to use as pistolets, it's simple, cheap, and easy to maintain.
Delaroche: O strange aquatic creature, you'd better pray I don't catch you. Otherwise, special treatment shall be in order!

## Talk

Traveler: Well, I shan't bother you, then.
Delaroche: Huh? Wait. Did you ask me something? Sorry, I didn't notice you there — I won't do that again, trust me!

## Talk

Traveler: How's your recent catches been?
Delaroche: Ah! The God of Victorious Linebreaking! We meet again!
Delaroche: I've been steadily improving my bait recently, and think I've come a long way. I've even caught several... somewhat larger fish!
Delaroche: I still don't think I've managed to create the ideal bait, however, so I don't have anything to give you...
Delaroche: But please, don't worry! At this rate, I know I'll be able to recreate that wonderful bait sooner or later!

## Talk

Traveler: How's the haul?
Delaroche: Why, hello there! Thanks for your concern!
Delaroche: As you can see, I'm having a hard time with these Linebreakers, these fighters who dwell underwater. I haven't really had much success yet.
Delaroche: But so long as I keep my head down and keep at it, believe me, I shall eventually earn my victory!
