Traveler: Did you find anything?
Tanjiyy: Did I find anything? Hmm... How about a remaining belief in the Goddess of Flowers? Eh, I'm afraid whatever is left of that belief has been wiped out now â€” it's gone for good.
Tanjiyy: And... I found many books smuggled out of the Akademiya. The amount is very huge if I do say so.
Tanjiyy: Some of which are completely foreign to me... Uh, for instance... there are books about "films." What did they want these for?
Tanjiyy: But apparently, we were wrong to presume that the desert folks were illiterate fools who would turn their noses up at knowledge... They were truly extraordinary.
