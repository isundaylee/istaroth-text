# Kano Nana's Healthy Diet


## Talk 1

Traveler: Were you looking for some Carrots?
Kano Nana: Kids have gotta learn to eat their vegetables if they want to grow up. You can't be a picky eater, even when it comes to Carrots.
Kano Nana: Anyway. You must be the one who accepted my commission? Do you have 15 Carrots for me?
Traveler: Got them right here.
Traveler: Not yet.
Kano Nana: Okay. Well, I'll be waiting here once you've got them.

## Talk 2

Kano Nana: Good, great, excellent. This time, I'm gonna watch that kid until she's eaten every last mouthful.
