Traveler: Not working?
Gontharet: Work? Why, I'm doing something far more important than work!
Gontharet: Those who always work and work will find themselves little different from clockwork machines. It is only through constant questioning and asking that we can forge a new path!
Gontharet: Our history and present are all proof of this.
Gontharet: If you do not mind treating me to a cup of coffee, we can continue this line of conversation.
