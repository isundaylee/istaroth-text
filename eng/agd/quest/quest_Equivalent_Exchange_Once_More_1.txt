# Equivalent Exchange Once More


## Talk 1

Viktor: Hello, Traveler. You couldn't have come at a better time.
Traveler: How's your wood carving going?
Viktor: Uh... Mr. Vsevolod found out that I've been carving wood in secret...
Viktor: But he didn't really get angry about it. He just told me to stay focused while I'm at work... He even asked me for a wood carving of a bunny.
Traveler: Does he have a child to cajole too?
Viktor: Mr. Vsevolod said that my wood carvings have a strong Snezhnayan style, and that he really likes them.
Viktor: I've heard that Mr. Vsevolod's orders have kept him from going home to his family in Snezhnaya for a very long time now.
Viktor: I think he might really be homesick, unlike me...
Viktor: *sigh* Let's stop here. Traveler, I've ordered another batch of wood from Hamawi. Please help me take a look at how it's going.
Traveler: Just get the payment ready.
Viktor: Don't worry, I've prepared real currency for you this time.
Traveler: Don't you want to return to Snezhnaya?
Viktor: It's not that bad for me... I don't have any relatives in Snezhnaya, and I'm used to traveling. It's quite comfortable here in Sumeru too...
Viktor: I only spoke about returning to Snezhnaya because it was too boring in Mondstadt... *cough*!
Viktor: Anyway, I'm leaving this to you. I'll have your payment ready.
Traveler: You Fatui are real children at heart, aren't you...

## Talk 2

Hamawi: What awful luck...
Traveler: About Viktor's wood...
Hamawi: Are you talking about the wood that the Fatuus ordered?
Hamawi: *sigh* I knew dealing with the Fatui wouldn't end well.
Hamawi: We were attacked by monsters while transporting that wood. All of us made it back alive, but our cart didn't. We were forced to leave the wood by the roadside.
Hamawi: I dare not go over there, nor can I find someone to get rid of those monsters so soon...
Traveler: We aren't Fatui...
Hamawi: Aren't you a Fatuus? Then why are you helping him?
Hamawi: Anyway, I can only leave my cart there for now and see if I can hire someone to deal with the situation.
Hamawi: If you are anxious to get the wood, I'll mark the approximate location of the cart on the map for you, then you can go take a look for yourself.
Hamawi: *sigh* Nothing good ever comes of things that the Fatui are involved in...

## Talk 3

Viktor: So, Traveler, how did it go?
Black Screen Text: You tell Viktor what happened...
Viktor: Wonderful, thank you, Traveler.
Viktor: Here's your payment. Now, I'll go back to writing Lily's letter.
Viktor: *sigh* Writing a letter to her makes me more nervous than writing a report for Mr. Vsevolod...

## Talk 4

Viktor: I didn't expect myself to be able to pick up wood carving again...

## Talk 5

Hamawi: *sigh* Nothing good ever comes of things that the Fatui are involved in...

## Talk 6

Hamawi: *sigh* Nothing good ever comes of things that the Fatui are involved in...
Traveler: About Viktor's wood...
Hamawi: This wood... You've chased away all the monsters? You're stronger than you look...
Hamawi: Thank you. I'll head over with a few others later and bring the wood back.
Hamawi: *sigh* Nothing good ever comes of things that the Fatui are involved in...

## Talk 7

Viktor: How did it go? Has my wood arrived?
Black Screen Text: You tell Viktor what happened...
Viktor: Monsters again? Why does it feel like every cart in the world is being attacked by monsters...
Viktor: Never mind. The wood got here, and that's what counts.
Viktor: Oh, right. Here's the payment I promised you. Make sure to tally it up.
Viktor: Uh, by the way... Um, is Lily doing well?
Viktor: I didn't say goodbye to her before I left. I hope she isn't angry...
Traveler: She's doing really well.
Viktor: Alright. *cough*... Don't look at me like that. I was just a little concerned!
Viktor: Anyway, make sure you tally your remuneration, Traveler. I prepared the exact amount.
Traveler: Go back and visit her yourself, then.
Viktor: Mr. Vsevolod will give me a real hiding if I do that, so forget it.
Viktor: I don't quite dare to send a letter directly either.
Viktor: Receiving a letter from a Fatuus sounds like a bad thing. Hahaha...

## Talk 8

Viktor: Traveler, perfect timing! Come over here and help me with something.
Traveler: What are you up to now?
Viktor: I'm trying to make a dish from Sumeru using Snezhnayan cooking methods.
Viktor: But I don't recognize many spices from Sumeru, so I'm having to do it slowly by trial and error...
Traveler: Is this a Fatuus' job too?
Viktor: Uh... Inspecting the quality of spices is within the scope of my job, of course.
Viktor: But let's get back to business. Because my... work schedule for inspecting the quality of spices has been too tight, the spices are consumed rapidly.
Viktor: After some discussions with Mr. Vsevolod, we've decided to commission Mr. Lambad to purchase spices for us.
Viktor: We're regulars at Mr. Lambad's tavern, so we trust his judgment.
Viktor: Traveler, please help me ask Mr. Lambad about how the purchase of spices is going.
Viktor: Besides that... Ask him if he has any good food ready. It's almost mealtime...
Traveler: Alright.
Viktor: Unfortunately, Mr. Vsevolod is always away for work, or I would have introduced you to him.
Traveler: I don't want to get to know a Fatuus.
Viktor: We'd just be saying hello. We aren't high-ranking Fatui, we just manage logistics. What kind of trouble could we possibly bring you?
Viktor: Anyway, I'll be leaving this to you, Traveler.
Traveler: I don't want to join the Fatui.
Traveler: You just wanted food, right?
Viktor: It's part of my job! Am I the kind of person who neglects his job and only thinks about food? Trust me, alright?
Traveler: You sure seem happy about all this...
Viktor: Huh? Uh... Sort of? I wouldn't consider it out of the ordinary. I go to work every day, after all.

## Talk 9

Jut: Did you get the Windwheel Aster?

## Talk 10

Lambad: Perfect. These should be enough. Please give me a moment.
Black Screen Text: Lambad starts cooking...
Lambad: It's done. This serving is for you. Please take the other two servings of Panipuri to those two.

## Talk 11

Viktor: Mr. Vsevolod is working all day. In fact, I've even heard that he hasn't been back to Snezhnaya in years. I really wonder how he made it up till now...

## Talk 12

Lambad: Hello there. Is there anything I can help you with?
Traveler: I've been commissioned by Viktor...
Lambad: Oh, this is about the spices he asked me to purchase, right? I've got them right here, and I'll send them over in a while.
Lambad: Lunch? Oh my, we were quite busy today, so almost all the ingredients have been used up...
Lambad: I know! Traveler, can you get me two potatoes?
Lambad: In return... I'll make you some Panipuri. Thanks.

## Talk 13

Jut: This is a Windwheel Aster? Hmm, an interesting plant indeed...
Jut: I'll take it. Tell him to leave making a sachet to me.

## Talk 14

Viktor: So, what did Lambad say?
Black Screen Text: You tell Viktor what happened...
Viktor: Lambad really is a reliable boss and a really nice person.
Viktor: Unlike the others who instinctively become wary of us when they find out that we're Fatui.
Traveler: That's your own fault, alright?
Viktor: Oh, it smells really good. I bet Vsevolod would like it too.
Traveler: Seriously...
Viktor: And here's the payment I promised you. Tally it up if you have to.
Traveler: It's the Fatui's fault that things are like that...

## Talk 15

Lambad: Did you get the potatoes?

## Talk 16

Viktor: Why are these spices so expensive?
Traveler: Have you not bought the spices yet?
Viktor: Traveler! You're finally here. Uh... I have a question for you...
Viktor: D—Do you have any Windwheel Aster?
Traveler: Why are you suddenly asking that?
Viktor: Remember how I was busy with the spices? I heard Lambad mention something called a "sachet" during our discussion.
Viktor: To be specific, various flowers are dried in a small cloth pouch, some even sprinkle a dash of perfume on it...
Viktor: So, they tell me that ladies are really fond of these "sachets"...
Traveler: I never expected this from you, Viktor...
Viktor: N—No! What are you talking about? Don't you remember that we spoke about sending Lily a letter?
Viktor: After giving it a lot of thought, I've decided to write Lily a letter. Leaving without saying goodbye was a terrible decision...
Viktor: Of course, making a sachet is absolutely beyond me, nor do I have enough materials. That's why I asked Jut to gather the materials for me.
Viktor: But I couldn't afford the spices in his shop... So, I offered him "equivalent exchange."
Viktor: Simply put, I'll give him rare plants in exchange for him helping me to gather rare spices.
Viktor: I promised Jut that I'd get him a Windwheel Aster, but I can't return to Mondstadt right now...
Viktor: So, Traveler, could you help me with this?
Traveler: Just get my payment ready.
Viktor: No problem. There'll be enough to go around, believe me!
Viktor: I'm counting on you. I'll be waiting for you here.
Viktor: But how should I start my letter to Lily?
Traveler: Is this another one of the Fatui's plans?
Viktor: Of course not. Mr. Vsevolod would have asked for funding if it were. Why would I even have to ask for your help then?
Viktor: Anyway, I'm trying to get away from the Fatui now, so I don't care about any of their plans.
Viktor: I've had enough of being suspected all the time...
Viktor: Oh, don't tell anyone about this, or they'll call me in for a little... chat...
Traveler: You're really planning on settling down in Sumeru, huh?
Traveler: What do you need Windwheel Aster for?

## Talk 17

Viktor: How should I start my letter to Lily?
Viktor: "Dear Lily"... Wait, I can't write that.
Viktor: "Hi, Lily"... Well, that doesn't sound too bad...

## Talk 18

Jut: What does a Windwheel Aster smell like?
Traveler: About Viktor's commission...
Jut: Yes, I did make an agreement with him. He'll help me find rare plants, and I'll help him make a sachet.
Jut: You're the one he hired to help, right? If you get a Windwheel Aster, you can just pass it to me.

Viktor: I was talking with the Traveler about the commission, sir!
