Farabi: Hmm... Something's bothering me. Does such a creature really exist?
Farabi: Sorry, I was just thinking about something. Mr. Edmund told me today that he once found huge animal prints at the base of Dragonspine.
Farabi: Based on the descriptions, they seem like the prints of a Snowboar. But can there really be a Snowboar that big?
Farabi: Once we determine the route the Snowboars took, the next stage would be to go to Dragonspine to investigate their survival out in the wild. Let's keep an eye out for the huge prints then as well.
