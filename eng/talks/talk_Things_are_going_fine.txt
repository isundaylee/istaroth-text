Traveler: Things are going fine.
Belkacem: Ah, that is good. If you do run into any trouble, remember to call the guards.
Belkacem: Though that old fellow Anpu likes to say "come to me if you have any trouble," please, don't bother him with every little thing.
Belkacem: I've known him since we were children, then I left the village to seek out more opportunities. I've done business, made a living as a mercenary, done menial labor... I've tried just about everything.
Belkacem: When I came back, he'd already become a "do-everything-myself" kind of naggy old man. Unexpected, but still...
Belkacem: And that's why I've volunteered to become a guard. Apart from going on patrol, I also help to lighten his load somewhat.
