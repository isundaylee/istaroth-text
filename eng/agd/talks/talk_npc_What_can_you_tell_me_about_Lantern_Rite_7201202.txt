Traveler: What can you tell me about Lantern Rite?
Nervous An: Lantern Rite is an annual festival everyone in Liyue celebrates. It takes place during the first full moon of the year.
Nervous An: During the five-day festival, people pray for peace, ward off evil spirits, and watch the lanterns. We believe the fire's light keeps wisdom alive, and guides fallen heroes home along the sea.
Nervous An: It's a popular tradition to make Xiao Lanterns and release them into the night sky.
Nervous An: The lanterns light the path for the souls of our fallen heroes as they travel by cover of night. We hope the lanterns will guide them back home so they can be reunited with us here.
Nervous An: Of course, I enjoy the time off work the most! Haha, I hope you thoroughly enjoy yourselves and participate in all the festivities on offer.
