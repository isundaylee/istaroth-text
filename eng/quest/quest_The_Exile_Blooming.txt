# The Exile: Blooming


## Talk 1

Sabbah: Here for a chat? I've been wanting to talk to somebody.

## Talk 2

Traveler: Which Darshan were you with, by the way?
Sabbah: Oh, I could talk for three whole days about that!
Sabbah: I was with Amurta and specialized in plant evolution, so you could say my work was evidence-based.
Sabbah: That means it is impossible to reach new conclusions without new forms of evidence. Simply put, fossils are necessary for the study of historical plants.
Sabbah: But there are only so many fossil samples available, and the Akademiya is limited in its ability to provide new ones.
Sabbah: Those were the circumstances, yet the institute still demanded results.
Sabbah: So some people would just take a previous study, revise or add something to it, and turn it in. You also find that quite pointless, right?
Sabbah: In truth, we could make new discoveries for sure if we looked towards history and geography for new materials.
Sabbah: Certain literary documents that Amurta would usually ignore could be used as well, though that would surely cross into Vahumana and Haravatat territory.
Sabbah: I was not proficient in those fields, and requesting the related files was too troublesome, never mind working with their researchers...
Sabbah: But I believe that if we could actually work together as a team, many questions of the past would finally be answered.
Sabbah: It's a shame that we couldn't continue our collaboration attempts. I must say that people in Vahumana and Haravatat have very peculiar perspectives, though...
Sabbah: I had to be very careful with my wording and phrasing in my submissions to them to avoid misunderstandings and misinterpretations.
Sabbah: Before I was kicked out of the Akademiya, I was still in the middle of an argument with someone from Haravatat. Now I can't even do that...
Sabbah: Ah, I just rambled for a long time... But it feels good.
Sabbah: Before you got here, I really didn't have many friends, and it could get pretty lonely.
Sabbah: Very few people in the village are into gardening.
Sabbah: ...Well, that's not entirely true. An old man living to the north of the village also plowed a plot to grow flowers.
Sabbah: I've visited him before. He's a slightly eccentric old man.
Sabbah: I saw him planting stones, but he insisted that they were flowers, and even kicked me out.
Sabbah: It must be lonely, living all by himself. I can understand that.
Sabbah: You helped me with my Sumeru Roses... Maybe you can help him with his plants too.
Sabbah: You and Paimon should visit him if you get a chance.

## Talk 3

Sabbah: There you are. You're very punctual.
Sabbah: I made some Butter Chicken. You're welcome to dine with me if you're hungry.
Paimon: Butter Chicken! How could we refuse? A big plate for Paimon, please!
Traveler: Watch your manners, Paimon.
Paimon: Okay, sorry...
Sabbah: It's okay, there's no need to be so formal. It's only human nature to love food.
Sabbah: I'll heat some up and pack it for you. It's the least I could do to show my gratitude for your help.
Paimon: You're so nice, Miss Sabbah! Your roses will surely grow and flower, just like you wanted!
Sabbah: Well, I've been keeping the soil moist, so the sprouts have been coming along.
Sabbah: My only worry is that they are growing slowly.
Sabbah: Generally speaking, if a germ is in good shape, it should grow quickly enough, but these few have been dormant so far...
Sabbah: I'm not sure if it's because the soil isn't fertile enough. I may have to add more fertilizer if this keeps up.
Traveler: Let's fertilize them again.
Sabbah: Would you do me this favor, then?
Paimon: Piece of cake. We got this!
Traveler: We can try using Dendro again.
Traveler: Sorry about Paimon's outburst.

## Talk 4

Sabbah: Thank you again. Honestly, it gladdens my heart to see Sumeru Roses grow in this environment.
Black Screen Text: As you talk to Sabbah, new leaves begin to sprout...
Black Screen Text: The leaves unfold, revealing flower buds.
Black Screen Text: The flower buds slowly open and blossom into Sumeru Roses.
Black Screen Text: Sabbah picks one and hands it to you and Paimon.
Paimon: You shouldn't have... You didn't have many to begin with...
Sabbah: It's all right. After all, this wouldn't have been possible without your help.
Traveler: We were just lending a hand.
Sabbah: A rose garden is magnificent, but a single rose also has beauty of its own. I've been intrigued by roses ever since my scholarly days.
Paimon: What? You were a researcher?
Sabbah: Right, I haven't told you yet... I'm not a native of Aaru Village. I "moved" here from the Akademiya.
Paimon: See, didn't Paimon tell you that Miss Sabbah speaks in a refined way, just like the researchers we've met?
Paimon: You planted these because you wanted to continue studying roses, right?
Sabbah: I wouldn't say that. To be honest, I don't think that researchers' interest in their subjects should be cultivated just for research's sake alone.
Sabbah: I did this because I love this world and want to understand the life cycle of plants.
Sabbah: As for me, I once studied the impact of geographical changes on the evolution of roses.
Sabbah: Just consider this. If the environments in Sumeru had changed in a totally different way, how would these roses have adapted?
Sabbah: Would they have crawled up the walls like ivy? If so, the walls of the Akademiya would now be covered in roses.
Sabbah: Would they have formed clusters? A natural bouquet! Wouldn't that have been lovely?
Sabbah: Maybe they might have even developed a spectrum of colors... White, red, and gold... Brand new species in their own right.
Sabbah: Of course, very few people discover new species nowadays, much less develop new species like the top researchers used to do.
Sabbah: What I want to say is that there's a vast amount of potential in every rose.
Sabbah: Exploring the possibilities is a lot of fun for me. Back then, I would happily collect samples every day.
Sabbah: Looking back now, that was a simple and joyful time.
Sabbah: Anyway, just take it. To me, this is no loss. I am freely sharing my happiness.
Sabbah: If you still feel awkward, just visit me often, and bring some Sumeru Roses with you.
Sabbah: I feel at ease when I talk to you.
Sabbah: And no matter what I said, you never thought it was nonsense or interrupted me.
Sabbah: I'll have small gifts for you too. Though I have no use for them now, you might like them.
Traveler: We'll be back.
Sabbah: Please do return.
Traveler: Don't sweat it.

## Talk 5

Traveler: How's life in Aaru Village?
Sabbah: It's alright. I have food and a roof over my head. All the essential things in life are taken care of.
Sabbah: I was banished, after all, so I can't dream of having books and research instruments here.
Sabbah: This place has been used as exiled scholars' banishing grounds for quite a while. Life is hard and practical here, so naturally, no one here is interested in academics or research.
Sabbah: I'm certainly not the first exile, and probably won't be the last.
Sabbah: All I can do is to learn to live with it.
Sabbah: Ah, I just rambled for a long time... But it feels good.
Sabbah: Before you got here, I really didn't have many friends, and it could get pretty lonely.
Sabbah: Very few people in the village are into gardening.
Sabbah: ...Well, that's not entirely true. An old man living to the north of the village also plowed a plot to grow flowers.
Sabbah: I've visited him before. He's a slightly eccentric old man.
Sabbah: I saw him planting stones, but he insisted that they were flowers, and even kicked me out.
Sabbah: It must be lonely, living all by himself. I can understand that.
Sabbah: You helped me with my Sumeru Roses... Maybe you can help him with his plants too.
Sabbah: You and Paimon should visit him if you get a chance.

## Talk 6

Traveler: This is a Sumeru Rose that I picked.
Sabbah: How I miss this sight... Here, your presents are ready too. Please, take them.
Sabbah: They're all seeds of plants that won't grow here. If you have a yard somewhere else, you can watch them mature there.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Sabbah: If it weren't for you, I don't think I'd have ever seen these roses sprout.
Sabbah: If only I knew this would happen... instead of seeds, I should have brought a few more books.
Traveler: You're not from here?
Sabbah: Are you surprised? Well, I guess that means that I've adapted pretty well.
Sabbah: When I first got here, I was unable to get used to anything, whether it be the food, the housing, or anything else.
Sabbah: But I got used to everything over time.
Sabbah: That doesn't mean that I've fully accepted my predicament, though.
Sabbah: I suppose it is impossible to make roses from Sumeru City bloom here after all.
Traveler: Are you a researcher?
Sabbah: I could have been called that once, but not anymore.
Sabbah: I said something beyond my station, and learned something I shouldn't have.
Sabbah: I broke the Akademiya's taboos, so I was removed from amongst their ranks.
Traveler: What did you say?
Sabbah: Curiosity is the impetus for seeking wisdom, but it's also the cause of sin.
Sabbah: I only understood that after I was exiled to this place.
Sabbah: For safety reasons, I don't think I should go into details.
Traveler: All right then.
Sabbah: Ahem, but...
Sabbah: I thought adventurers would just come and go, never coming back to chit-chat after finishing their jobs.
Sabbah: I didn't expect to have another long conversation with you.
Sabbah: To be honest, I don't have a lot of friends to talk to here.
Sabbah: Do you think... at some point... you would be able to come by and fertilize my plants again?
Traveler: Sure.
Sabbah: ...Okay then, I'll wait for you.
Traveler: Why grow Sumeru Roses?
Sabbah: You probably don't know much about them... but they are very versatile, and have many uses.
Sabbah: They can be eaten, turned into medicine, given as gifts, or fetch a good price on the market.
Sabbah: And that's just some of the more common applications.
Sabbah: The flower, leaves, and stalk of a Sumeru Rose also did not always look like this. They all had different appearances once upon a time.
Sabbah: I believe geographical changes led to changes in the roses' traits.
Sabbah: A study of its traits could help us derive past geographical and historical information.
Sabbah: I won't be able to explain the mechanism over just a casual conversation, and sharing such information with adventurers is probably against the rules as well.
Sabbah: If you're interested in botanical evolution, you should visit the Akademiya. They'll have more on the subject.
Traveler: So, you're doing this for your research?
Sabbah: I'm not a researcher anymore. I no longer have the right or means to pursue any research.
Sabbah: If you must know why... *sigh*, you are a very curious soul, you know that?
Sabbah: I grew a lot of Sumeru Roses back in my former residence. The flowers were spectacular, and I got to see them every day.
Sabbah: If it was possible, I wish I could see them again, just like before.
Sabbah: ...That's all there is to it.
Traveler: I can understand that.

### Additional Talk 2

Sabbah: You don't seem to have a Vision, and yet you can control Dendro. You're no ordinary adventurer, I think.
Sabbah: Supposedly, there are people who can control the elements without a Vision, but such people are of universally ill repute...
Sabbah: You, however, have a good heart. Don't stray onto the wrong path!
