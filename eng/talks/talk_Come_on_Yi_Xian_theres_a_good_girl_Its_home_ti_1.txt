Yi Zhu: Come on Yi Xian, there's a good girl. It's home time...
Yi Xian: I'm not going home! I'm going to look for Mommy!
Yi Zhu: But Mommy isn't coming home...
Yi Xian: *sobs* Why won't Mommy come home... Does Mommy not love us anymore?
Yi Zhu: Hey, don't say such silly things...
Yi Xian: But, but... I know I saw the lady with black clothes bring Mommy here... *sobs*
Yi Zhu: Yi Xian, what happened was... Mommy is one of the stars in the sky now.
Yi Xian: You mean Mommy isn't sleeping anymore? ...You're lying, I don't believe you!
Yi Zhu: I'm telling the truth, Yi Xian... Listen, how about we wait till nighttime and I take you up onto the roof? When you see the starlight, you will feel Mommy's loving eyes looking down...
