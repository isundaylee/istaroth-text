Traveler: Is Mikoshi Genichirou your elder brother?
Mikoshi Genjirou: Tsk... That incompetent loser. He's content with just owning a small shop. He is still the same after all these years. So sluggish.
Mikoshi Genjirou: I knew that he wouldn't accomplish anything ever since he was little. And as expected, the future of the Mikoshi clan is still mine to uphold.
