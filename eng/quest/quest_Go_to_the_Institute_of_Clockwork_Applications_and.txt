# Go to the Institute of Clockwork Applications and retrieve the Anchor


## Talk 1

Nacker: #There should be a Survey Anchor here too. I'll open the door, and leave the recovery to you, {NICKNAME}.

## Talk 2

Chronie: Yeah... I still can't forget how Choiseul just kept equivocating.
Chronie: And that Raimondo... So haughty and arrogant. Did you see how he was looking at me?
Chronie: I think you're much better than either of those two. Things would have never turned out like that if you were in their position.

## Talk 3

Nacker: I believe this place was originally Butor's "Institute of Clockwork Applications." In the field of clockwork machines, Monsieur Butor was one of the leading authorities.
Nacker: However, scientifically, the development and advancement of traditional clockwork machines had reached a bottleneck. In terms of applications, traditional clockwork machines were obviously at a great disadvantage.
Nacker: Anyway, Monsieur Butor's program was slowly being marginalized at the Institute. His funding was cut, and he struggled to recruit researchers.
Nacker: After a series of unfortunate incidents, Monsieur Butor's group finally disbanded, and this facility was completely abandoned.
Nacker: *sigh* Monsieur Butor was terribly unlucky, if you ask me...
