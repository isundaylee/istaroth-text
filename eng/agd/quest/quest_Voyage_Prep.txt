# Voyage Prep


## Talk 1

???: Ho there, Traveler! How've you been? Interested in doing some work for the Crux Fleet?
Traveler: The Crux Fleet...?
???: Eh? Oh, right! Haha, my apologies.
Muzhen: I'm Muzhen, Chief Technical Officer of the Alcor. I spend most of my time below deck, so it's no surprise that you're not familiar with me.
Muzhen: Well, Sea Drake kicked me out and made me come outside, haha.
Muzhen: "Move those lazy bones of yours and go get some sun, it'll do you good!," he said. So here I am, on shore, thanks to him...
Muzhen: Hah! Not that he'd get off the boat himself though! Why, he'd faint the moment he sets foot on dry land.
Traveler: Oh...
Muzhen: Ah, yes. How rude of me to forget about the real business while making fun of someone else.
Muzhen: Well, I've got some technical preparation-related errands that you can run to help prepare for the next leg of Captain Beidou's journey.
Muzhen: These things are usually handled by the Captain herself. The person in command of The Crux must have the pioneering spirit to explore the unknown...
Muzhen: This is our rule, after all, and whoever is the boss will have to take up such duties.
Muzhen: Still, the Captain has priority matters she needs to attend to at the moment. Certainly not matters that should be delayed by a few small odd jobs.
Paimon: So you're pushing them off to us, then?
Muzhen: Well, y'see, I'm a Technical Officer, not a fighter... And it's not as if the rest of the crew don't have things to do. No one's got the time to spare.
Muzhen: Well then. That's all for the chit-chat. Here's the skinny...
Muzhen: The person who ordered our next shipment wants some samples... Specifically, samples of components from some special Ruin machines.
Muzhen: According to the eyewitness reports this particular employer sent us, these machines... or organisms, are hidden throughout the islands of Inazuma. Very fascinating beings.
Traveler: And who might this employer be...?
Muzhen: Oh ho? Trying to get me to spill the beans on our trade secrets huh?
Muzhen: Haha! Not to worry. I'd be more than happy to tell you if I knew... even though technically speaking, it'd be a capital offense.
Muzhen: I don't know who our employer is, anyway, so you'll have to excuse me. It's not something you should be concerned about, anyway.
Traveler: So, where do we find them?
Muzhen: Hah! See, now you're the asking the right questions.
Muzhen: Trouble is that I've got no clue where they are either.
Muzhen: However, we've discovered strange Electro phenomena occurring in some regions of the islands. According to my observations, there is a huge gap in frequency between occurrences of such phenomena in these places compared to others across Inazuma.
Muzhen: I would hazard a guess that we're most likely to find good leads if we investigate these anomalous areas first.
Muzhen: Should you find any by-products from those phenomena, please bring them back here for me to study.
Muzhen: As for remuneration, don't worry, I've got you covered on that front.
Traveler: Mechanical organisms?
Muzhen: Aye. The miners at The Chasm once dug up similar things. Word is that they're related to the disaster that happened five hundred years ago.
Muzhen: Whatever the case, they're an ominous bunch, wandering through the ruins as they do. Gets me scared and excited all at once...
Muzhen: Just thinking about one of them makes my hands itch. Wish I could pry one open and have a look inside...
Muzhen: It's alright if you don't understand. You're not a technician, after all.
Traveler: Interesting, you say...
Muzhen: Well, I mean... Wouldn't you want to open one up yourself?
Paimon: Not... really...?
Muzhen: Hmph. Alright then... I guess only a fellow technician would understand how I feel.
Traveler: Do you need a hand with anything?
Traveler: Do I know you?

## Talk 2

Muzhen: *sigh* Only after following Captain Beidou across the lands did I realize that Liyue was best...
Muzhen: Well, I say that, but I've never really gotten off the boat.
Traveler: So, as for that next leg of the journey...
Muzhen: Nope, sorry, that's confidential. I can only tell you that we're going to Sumeru next.
Muzhen: I can't say much more, and I'd suggest that you refrain from asking.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Muzhen: Alright. Hope things go well with you!
