## Talk

Murakami: Greetings, we sell festival snacks here. Would you like to try some?

## Talk

Traveler: Festival snacks...
Murakami: Ha, though we called them festival snacks, they really are no different from ordinary dishes. The difference lies in the wrappings.
Murakami: It's just as delicious, though! Besides, food you eat at festivals always feel a little more special somehow, don't they?
Murakami: Either way, my shop is always open whether there's an event on or not. You're welcome to come and stuff your face if you ever get hungry.

## Talk

Traveler: Long time no see!
Murakami: My, my, if it isn't Miss Kamisato's friend. Welcome!
Murakami: Ever since you brought Miss Kamisato here last time, we've been having more and more people come to try our Sakura Mochi and Egg Rolls!
Murakami: I'll definitely take good care of you and Miss Kamisato the next time you two come again.
Murakami: Say, have you mastered the Sakura Mochi recipe just yet?

## Talk

Traveler: I've almost got it down.
Murakami: I like that confidence!
Murakami: I was about to say that you can come and ask me if you have any issues with the recipe, but it seems like you've got it all under control!
Murakami: Ah, it'd be wonderful if everyone was able to enjoy delicious food that they made by themselves.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Murakami: Remember to come back again if you're ever hungry!
