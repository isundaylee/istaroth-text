Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Hey, I haven't seen Mr. Sawleg around the caf√© lately."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "You mean old Horler? Heard he got arrested. Apparently someone who was copying his performance art impersonated him on the Vasari Passage's message board."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "He was so mad, he pretended to be the Maison Gardiennage and warned them off. Though they caught the copycat, he was sentenced as well for impersonating the Maison Gardiennage."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Looks like performance art in Fontaine is no path to success."
