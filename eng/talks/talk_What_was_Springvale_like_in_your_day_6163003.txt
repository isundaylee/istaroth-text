Traveler: What was Springvale like in your day?
Olaf: You mean, the age I lived in before my accidental cryopreservation?
Olaf: This spring was formed from melted snow and ice that came down from Dragonspine. I heard that Springvale originally began as just a group of hunters like me who settled in this area because of the water source.
Olaf: Over time, it gradually grew to the size of a small town. I certainly do not believe this nonsense you future folk trot out about some fountain fairy.
