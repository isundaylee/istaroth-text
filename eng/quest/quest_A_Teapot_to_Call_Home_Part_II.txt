# A Teapot to Call Home: Part II

Paimon: Wow... this teapot seems even bigger inside than Madame Ping's. There's even a great big house in the middle, too!
Paimon: Huh, but there's just a whole load of nothing around it...
Traveler: Get chiseling, Paimon — you could carve us a whole house out of this rock.
Paimon: Paimon can't do that! Well, you're the one with a sword, anyway — you do it!
Paimon: Still... why is it so empty here apart from that house?
Paimon: Oh, wait a second, what is that?
Traveler: Go dig a burrow to live in for now, I guess?
Paimon: Hey! There's a perfectly good house right over there. Why should Paimon have to live in a hole in the ground!?
