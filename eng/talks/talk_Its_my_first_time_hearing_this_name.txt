# Talk Dialog

Traveler: It's my first time hearing this name.
Shatir: What? There are people in Sumeru City who haven't heard of Vikram? Well... Maybe I'm the one who's taking it for granted, since I haven't met anyone who didn't know of him.
Shatir: He's been in the limelight recently, and is a strong candidate for the next Grand Conservator.
Shatir: I don't know what other people think, but other than Lisa, who according to legends has become Mondstadt's Grand Conservator, Vikram should be the most suitable candidate.
Shatir: After all, if the person in charge of the collections is as unreasonable as the one managing the funds, this study will be dead in the water.
