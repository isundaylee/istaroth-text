Sevigne: Hello. Do you need anything?

## Talk

Traveler: About the prototypes...
Sevigne: They were successfully recovered after the fact. It sure took a lot of effort to transport them.
Sevigne: After the inspection, we found both prototypes needed to be scrapped. They hadn't been maintained for a long time, plus...
Sevigne: Oh, I didn't mean to blame you. Mr. Maillardet has some new toys now and has completely forgotten about the prototypes.
Sevigne: He even delegated the recovery and inspection work. I had hoped I would have a chance to meet him, but it looks like I'll need to find an opportunity to visit Erinnyes for that...

## Talk

Traveler: About the portrait...
Sevigne: Oh, that... I was quite surprised that Mr. Bossuet didn't take it back to Petrichor.
Sevigne: After all, if it gets left here, who knows when someone will spill ink or some even harder to clean fluid on it...
Sevigne: I do have a few suspects in mind, but I expect that in the end Chisseray will be chosen to go to the Fortress of Meropide.
Sevigne: Goodness me, what am I doing! It's best not to say what you're really thinking in this kind of workplace.

## Talk

Traveler: Nothing, sorry to bother you.
Sevigne: Then I hope you have a most wonderful day.

## Talk

Traveler: About Maillardet...
Sevigne: Objectively speaking, the Icewind Suite is of less commercial value than Fonta. After all, the original proposal came from Mr. Bossuet...
Sevigne: Mr. Maillardet took it over and then added his own color... But if you ask me, the undertaking is much like the man himself. How to put it kindly? There's room for development?
