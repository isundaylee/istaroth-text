Chenxiang: Doudou, be a good girl, let's go pick your medicine. You'll only get better if you take your medicine.
Hongdou: I'm not going, I'm not going! I hate the medicine at Bubu Pharmacy. I hate it!
Chenxiang: You need to do as you're told, Doudou... And hey, if we go to Bubu Pharmacy, you'll get to see Baizhu. How about that?
Hongdou: Wow, really? ...Mr. Baizhu is so nice, I'm sure just seeing him will make me better. Then I won't need any medicine!
Chenxiang: Hmm, but if poor Mr. Baizhu found out you didn't like his medicine...You wouldn't want to make him mad, would you?
Hongdou: Erm... erm... What about if we just pick the medicine, but I don't take it?

Chenxiang: Doudou, be a good girl, let's go pick your medicine. You'll only get better if you take your medicine.
Hongdou: But I already ate it the last time, and I'm all better now! I don't wanna go!
Chenxiang: If you stop taking your medicine after getting a little better, you'll get sick again... And if we go to Bubu Pharmacy, you'll get to see Baizhu. How does that sound?
Hongdou: Mr. Baizhu's so nice, I'm sure just seeing him will make me better. The medicine's bitter, so I'm not eating it!
Chenxiang: Hmm, but if poor Mr. Baizhu found out you didn't like his medicine...You wouldn't want to make him mad, would you?
Hongdou: Erm... erm... What about if we just pick the medicine, but I don't take it?
