# Master Zhang's Metal Commission


## Talk 1

Traveler: About Iron Chunks...
Master Zhang: Yes, that's my commission. I'm all out of Iron Chunks here.
Master Zhang: Well, have you brought me ten Iron Chunks?
Traveler: Here they are.
Traveler: Not yet.
Master Zhang: I see. Well be sure to get me those Iron Chunks as soon as you've got them, the fire's hot and customers are waiting.

## Talk 2

Master Zhang: Hmm... These Iron Chunks should be enough, for now...
Master Zhang: These are for you. Thanks for the help.
