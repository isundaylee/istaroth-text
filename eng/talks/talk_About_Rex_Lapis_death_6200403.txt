Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Manager Xiao: Not now. I can't let myself be distracted while I'm at work.
Manager Xiao: I'm getting old myself, and the thought did once cross my mind: Will the dockyard collapse into dysfunction after I die?
Manager Xiao: But the answer is no! The orderly functioning of the dockyard, and of Liyue, is based on centuries of tradition. Things like that do not simply disappear overnight... I, for one, will not allow it!
Manager Xiao: In the same way, if the Lord of Geo is truly deceased... Well, I will simply continue to do my job. Just as I have always done. To do otherwise would be to dishonor his legacy.
