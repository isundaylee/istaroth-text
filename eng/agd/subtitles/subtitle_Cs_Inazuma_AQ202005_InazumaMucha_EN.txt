When lightning flashes, it casts a shadow
My name means shadow
With my blade, I purged all obstacles to progress
And yet... something was lost
With each step forward
In the end, I even lost her
The tales are still retold
In the shade of every Thunder Sakura
But the wounds left on our nation by that terrible loss
Still ache
"Never stop searching, even if only for a brief flash of light"
"If nothing else, we have the present moment"
She said that once
But I've seen a nation stride forward
And lose everything to the Heavenly Principles
Perhaps only if time stands still
Will the lightning's glow never fade
The present moment is a fragile illusion
Only Eternity can bring us closer to the Heavenly Principles
I am no longer the shadow
"Mine is the most supreme and noble form"
"Let power over the realm be vested within me"
"In this form shall I honor my subjects' dream"
"For a land of Eternity, unchanging forevermore"
