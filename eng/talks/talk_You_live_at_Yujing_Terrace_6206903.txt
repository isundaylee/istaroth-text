Traveler: You live at Yujing Terrace?
Jinzhong: Not exactly. My home is Chihu Rock, where my parents are from. Both are fishing folk.
Jinzhong: However, I am now stationed at Yujing Terrace with the Millelith. As such, I am now a member of the upper echelons of society. I mean, I spend all my working hours here, don't I?
Jinzhong: I may be a Millelith guard for now, but it's a start. I doubt it will be too long before I put down roots at Yujing Terrace.
Jinzhong: Doing so will make me a permanent member of high society.
Jinzhong: Don't worry â€” I won't forget you when I make it to the top! You need anything, you just let me know, alright?
