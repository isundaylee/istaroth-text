Bulletin Board (Kanjou Notice): However, should he commit any more acts of treason during this detention, he will be branded a public enemy of the Inazuman state and his judgment shall be enacted with extreme prejudice and without any mercy.
Bulletin Board (Kanjou Notice): While the Kanjou Commission debates the matter of his successor, the Commission's duties shall be performed by a personal deputy of Her Excellency.

## Talk 4

Bulletin Board (Message): "The war is finally over. But rather than feeling joy, I think I feel something more akin to liberation, like a heavy burden was lifted off my back."
Bulletin Board (Message): "The supervisors that the Yashiro Commissioner sent have done their duties admirably, decreasing the merchants' burden by a fair amount..."
Bulletin Board (Message): "And while the Sakoku Decree has not yet been repealed, it seems that business has turned around... There's hope for the future now, and no mistake."

## Talk 6

Bulletin Board (Kanjou Notice): We ask all shipments of military equipment and material to leave the borders of Inazuma and Sangonomiya immediately. The Fatui and all related personnel are included in this order.
Bulletin Board (Message): "I am but a humble leather goods contractor for the Shogun's Army and have nothing to do with the Fatui. I only knew of the war through the financial statements I went through..."
Bulletin Board (Message): "I have also only just gotten my permanent business permit from the Kanjou Commission. Am I still to be chased out nonetheless...?"
Bulletin Board (Reply): We apologize for the inconvenience we have caused you, but please do leave within the allotted time.

## Talk 7

Bulletin Board (Missing Person Poster): I'm searching for my husband, Inaba Tousaburou Kyuuzou. He is a tall man without any facial hair and has a scar on the side of his forehead. He has yet to return home despite the ceasefire.
Bulletin Board (Missing Person Poster): If any returning samurai or old friends and acquaintances know of his whereabouts, please inform me. You will be duly thanked for your help!
Bulletin Board (Missing Person Poster): Yours Respectfully, Inaba Shizuko.

## Talk 8

Bulletin Board (Message): "I was often stuck doing lots of rear echelon work, so I never got to see the grand sights of Inazuma City. But today, I finally got my wish."
Bulletin Board (Message): "The locals here in Ritou were pretty restrained. I guess it's because not too long ago, we were still at each others' throats..."
Bulletin Board (Message): "But we were welcomed very warmly by the outlanders. Couldn't find one of their stores without discounts for us Watatsumi folk anywhere you looked."
Bulletin Board (Message): "Looks like our actions did have a positive impact on their lives after all... I'm glad that all the unfortunate things that happened so far were not meaningless after all."

## Talk 9

Bulletin Board (Arataki "A Vision Returned" Itto): "Ahahaha! Ever since I got my Vision back, I've been super motivated! Guess who's back? That's right! I'm back!"
Bulletin Board (Arataki "A Vision Returned" Itto): "C'mon, Kujou Tengu! So I heard that you got a hiding and had to flee all the way back here. I'm practically laughing myself silly over here, you know? Ahahaha!"
Bulletin Board (Arataki "A Vision Returned" Itto): "I'll be waiting for you at the port just for an extra laugh! And don't forget about our duel!"
Bulletin Board (Reply): Would you shut up already? I heard you the first time!
Bulletin Board (Kanjou Notice): This message has been left specifically by Madam Sara and may not be removed.
Bulletin Board (Reply): I did not leave that there! Have it removed at once! Do your jobs, you people of the Outlander Affairs Agency, will you!?

## Talk 10

Bulletin Board (Message): "Watching these 'traitors' who so often had to give back before us saunter and shop their way through Ritou..."
Bulletin Board (Message): "And thinking back on all the losses and pain that we suffered during this war... bitterness wells up within me unbidden."
Bulletin Board (Message): "Still, I suppose that surviving and being able to reunite with my family was a good thing in the end... This war has just taken so much out of us all."
Bulletin Board (Another Person's Message): "I'm not sure if I get to say this, considering that we were enemies..."
Bulletin Board (Another Person's Message): "But we've been given a new opportunity by this peace, haven't we? I hear that Uyuu Restaurant is pretty famous around these parts. Let's go get a drink there some time."
Bulletin Board (Message): "...Don't you act so familiar with me."

## Talk 11

Bulletin Board (Message): "I came here to Ritou specifically to look for a Tenryou samurai who once gave me a sword wound on the battlefield."
Bulletin Board (Message): "I was going to thank him for not striking a fatal blow then and ask him for another duel."
Bulletin Board (Another Person's Message): "I hate to break it to you, but now that we are at peace, Her Excellency the Shogun has banned all duels with real swords save for duels before the throne."
Bulletin Board (Message): "Agh, come on! That's so boring! ... Ah, whatever. Let's just go get a drink or something, eh?"
Bulletin Board (Another Person's Message): "Speaking of drinking, I do know a good spot. Meet me at the docks later?"
Bulletin Board (Message): "Alright, that'd be great!"

## Talk 12

## Talk 15

Bulletin Board (Message): "The Kanjou Commission has restored a few trade routes on a limited basis, even though this only brings in a meager income even for larger shops..."
Bulletin Board (Message): "On the other hand, the hard work of the supervisors from the Yashiro Commission has seen many exorbitant taxes canceled."
Bulletin Board (Message): "For our outlanders, our purse-strings will probably remain tight for a while yet, but at least we've got some room to breathe..."
Bulletin Board (Message): "Regardless, these changes are certainly for the better."

## Talk 16

Bulletin Board (Message): "A friend who used to go out fishing together with me has returned. His time in the war seems to have left him very melancholy indeed."
Bulletin Board (Message): "Our neighbors have some reservations about him due to his having joined the resistance army, and have kept their distance for the most part..."
Bulletin Board (Message): "But it doesn't matter much to me. He's my friend and that's what counts!"

## Talk 17

Bulletin Board (Message): "The very next day after the ceasefire came into effect, a ship from Sangonomiya arrived, claiming to want to purchase some lifestyle goods from Yae Publishing House."
Bulletin Board (Message): "I mean, that's what I heard, at least."
Bulletin Board (Message): "That said, I've got no clue what lifestyle goods they thought they'd get at a bookstore..."
