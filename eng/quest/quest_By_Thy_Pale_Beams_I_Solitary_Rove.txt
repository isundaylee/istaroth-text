# By Thy Pale Beams I Solitary Rove


## Talk 1

Kujirai Momiji: Look, guys! I flipped through my father's sailing log again.
Kujirai Momiji: There's an appendix in there that mentions a special fish bait formula they had developed.
Kujirai Momiji: When they encountered the "Lunar Leviathan," they used a special bait that mixed Seagrass and Magical Crystal Ore.
Kujirai Momiji: If we can also make this, we may be able to attract the "Lunar Leviathan."
Kujirai Momiji: I have a lot of Seagrass, but the Magical Crystal Ore...
Traveler: Don't worry, I have them.
Kujirai Momiji: Eh? Really? Were they mined at Araumi?
Kujirai Momiji: My father's log mentioned that the Magical Crystal Ore must be mined from the ruins at Araumi.
Kujirai Momiji: Although I'm not sure what the difference is, compared to ordinary Magical Crystal Ore, but since we have decided to do so, we should be more rigorous and follow the sailing log closely.
Kujirai Momiji: Speaking of which, there are a lot of dangerous monsters over at Araumi. Let's go to the Adventurers' Guild and put up a commission.
Traveler: It's okay, I'll handle them.
Kujirai Momiji: Ah... Right, I forgot you are a powerful adventurer!
Kujirai Momiji: I'm so lucky to have your help, I'm counting on you!
Kujirai Momiji: I'll go back and get some bait-making tools, let's meet up later at the beach on the west of Araumi.

## Talk 2

Kujirai Momiji: You found them so quickly? You're a powerful adventurer indeed!
Traveler: Will these be enough?
Kujirai Momiji: Well, watch me next, I just have to do this...this...and this...
Kujirai Momiji: This should be it, that's all.
Paimon: The next step is to scatter the bait and wait for the "Lunar Leviathan" to appear, right?
Kujirai Momiji: Yes, I purposely chose this place, from where we reached the shore back then.
Kujirai Momiji: The "Lunar Leviathan" that guided us back to the ship also disappeared here.
Kujirai Momiji: So, is everyone ready? Don't forget to make a wish when you see the "Lunar Leviathan."
Traveler: What if it doesn't work?
Kujirai Momiji: ...
Kujirai Momiji: Don't say such discouraging things, it will work. The "Lunar Leviathan" will definitely come.
Paimon: Yeah! It will work! Big fish, big fish, you must be good and bite the bait! I'm counting on you!
Kujirai Momiji: Look! Look at this! It's glowing under the water! Something's coming!
Paimon: Really? Is the "Lunar Leviathan" really here?
Paimon: Help, it's a Ruin Guard!
Paimon: Why is it this guy!

## Talk 3

Kujirai Momiji: How...how did this happen, even my father's bait formula didn't work?
Paimon: Don't be sad, it's that Ruin Guard's fault! It must have scared the "Lunar Leviathan" away! Let's try again!
Traveler: Yeah, let's try again.
Kujirai Momiji: ...
Kujirai Momiji: ...
Kujirai Momiji: Let's forget it for now, I'm a little tired. Maybe Nantuck is right?
Kujirai Momiji: *sigh* I want to go and take a stroll outside. I have to think about what happens after this.
Kujirai Momiji: Here's your payment. Whatever the case, thank you very much for your help.
Paimon: Looks like Ms. Kujirai wants to be left alone now, let's come back to see her later.
