Traveler: How do you like it here?
Amber: I like it a lot!
Amber: I'm not too fussy about where I stay. After all, as an Outrider, I have to be able to adapt to all kinds of surroundings.
Amber: If I had to, I could even sleep on a tree branch.
Traveler: That's some impressive survival skills!
Amber: Y—You really think so...?
Amber: Anyway, don't worry, this place is great!
Traveler: I hope you're more comfortable here than on a tree branch.
Amber: Hahaha, of course I am!

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Amber: Sure!
Amber: ...
Amber: Sorry, I'm no good at telling stories. Not like Lisa or my grandfather... They seem to be able to fit a thrilling tale into every conversation.
Traveler: Haven't you been keeping a journal—
Amber: Huh!? How long have you known about that!?
Amber: N—Not that I've been hiding it from anyone, it's just that... well, you'd be flattered to read some of the entries...
Amber: ...But it's still a bit embarrassing to just let someone else read my journal!
Amber: Hmm... I guess I could pick out some excerpts from my adventures if you're interested.
Amber: Okay! Where do I start...
Traveler: I'd like to hear more about your past.
Amber: My past...
Amber: Uh... I think you might find it a little boring. Besides, in hindsight, let's just say that little Amber was... a bit of a nuisance.
Amber: I mean, if you really wanna know, I'm happy to tell you about it... but only if you promise you won't laugh at me!
Traveler: Sounds good to me!

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Traveler: *Anything you'd like to do?*
Amber: Let's have dinner together!
Amber: It doesn't need to be anything sophisticated. I just want to enjoy the feeling of having a meal at home. It's quite different from eating out.
Amber: Restaurants are convenient and all, and you can always trust that the food's gonna be good.
Amber: But you only get that special cozy feeling when you're eating at home, you know?
Traveler: Yeah, I know what you mean.
Amber: Great! Then what are we waiting for?
Amber: Right, we'll do some steak, and— Oh, wait... you must have had my Outrider's Champion Steak a million times already.
Amber: You know what, it's high time I set myself a new culinary challenge.
Amber: ...Ooh, and I know just the dish — today, I'll try my hand at a Sticky Honey Roast!
Amber: Uh... But what if the smoke changes the color of your ceiling...
Traveler: I was thinking of painting it a new color anyway.
Traveler: Don't worry, I can help with the cooking.
Amber: Hehe, you're so kind to me.
Amber: Get ready for the most delicious meal you've ever eaten! ...Even if it takes me a few hundred times.
Amber: I can't wait...
Traveler: Alright, let's do it.
Amber: Really!?

Amber: You built such a spacious campsite — amazing...
Amber: Can I practice my archery and scouting techniques here?
Amber: Or maybe we can practice together! Let's compete and see who wins!

## Talk 10

Amber: Newcomers who are learning how to use wind gliders will practice simple exercises in Springvale.
Amber: Most of the buildings in Springvale only have two or three floors, which is an ideal height for those still getting accustomed to gliding.
Amber: However, please remember to glide legally! The rules also apply here.
