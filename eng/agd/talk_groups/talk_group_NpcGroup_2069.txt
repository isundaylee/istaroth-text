## Talk

Jinzhong: Hello. Please refrain from causing a stir or staging any commercial promotions in this area... Oh, sorry. I didn't recognize you there.
Jinzhong: People from Wangsheng Funeral Parlor have been coming here often quite recently for... "business development," was it called? Either way, it's been a massive headache. Please excuse my rudeness.
Jinzhong: Back on topic, then. Do you have something to report to the Millelith?

## Talk

Jinzhong: Greetings. Something to report to the Millelith? You've come to the right person.
Jinzhong: You may proceed.

## Talk

Traveler: Who're you?
Jinzhong: Me?
Jinzhong: Jinzhong, at your service! I represent the Millelith here at Yujing Terrace.
Jinzhong: If there's a situation, please report it immediately. The residents of Yujing Terrace are high-profile individuals. Ensuring their safety and well-being is my top priority.

## Talk

Traveler: You live at Yujing Terrace?
Jinzhong: Not exactly. My home is Chihu Rock, where my parents are from. Both are fishing folk.
Jinzhong: However, I am now stationed at Yujing Terrace with the Millelith. As such, I am now a member of the upper echelons of society. I mean, I spend all my working hours here, don't I?
Jinzhong: I may be a Millelith guard for now, but it's a start. I doubt it will be too long before I put down roots at Yujing Terrace.
Jinzhong: Doing so will make me a permanent member of high society.
Jinzhong: Don't worry — I won't forget you when I make it to the top! You need anything, you just let me know, alright?

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Jinzhong: While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail!
Jinzhong: Don't forget — when something important comes up, report to Jinzhong.
