Traveler: Tell me about yourself...
Lambad: Yesterday I was a sailor, today I'm the owner of this tavern.
Lambad: So, you'll be able to taste the chill of the ocean in my tavern's wine. And you won't find fresher seafood anywhere else!

Traveler: About the Lambad Fish Roll...
Lambad: It's a recipe I came up with on an adventure in my youth. The flavor of the finished product far exceeded my expectations, so I bestowed it with the great name of "Lambad"!
Lambad: When I was traveling around then, I had delicious grilled fish in Mondstadt, Liyue, and Inazuma. So, it got me thinking that the aroma of grilled fish in the air was just what Sumeru needed, too!
Lambad: And that's how my famous Lambad Fish Roll was born. And it's not just grilled fish — I combined it with Sumeru's specialty pitas to create a fish roll that can be eaten with ease, even on the choppiest of seas.
Lambad: Such a genius invention is naturally worthy of the resounding name of "Lambad."

Traveler: New tableware?
Lambad: Yep, there was some small accident in the tavern a few days ago, so the original tableware can't be used anymore.
Lambad: It turned out to be a blessing in disguise. The tableware we have now is made by craftspeople commissioned by Kshah{RUBY#[S]Technology}rewar researchers, with the patterns designed by Hara{RUBY#[S]Semiotics}vatat researchers.
Lambad: There is no other establishment in Sumeru City with such a luxurious setup.
Lambad: So you see, little accidents in life aren't necessarily all bad, hahaha!

Traveler: You built this tavern overnight? Impressive!
Lambad: Hahahaha! You're making me blush.
Lambad: I was exaggerating when I said that, but I wasn't kidding about being a great sailor in the past.
Lambad: I've passed through vast thunderstorms more wrathful than the Raiden Shogun, and I've pierced through glaciers steelier than the Tsaritsa's heart.
Lambad: But that was nothing...
Lambad: ...Nothing compared to being able to return safely to Sumeru and open this lively tavern! Hahaha!

Traveler: Is this for sampling?
Lambad: Of course! The fish was fresh from the water and the pitas just popped out of the oven. Here. Be careful, it's hot!
