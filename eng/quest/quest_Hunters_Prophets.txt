# Hunters, Prophets


## Talk 1

Mona: Seriously? Nobody just uses a scryglass whenever they've got time to just see who they'll meet on the road.
Paimon: Still, we didn't expect to see you here... Wait, you're not a Fontainian, are you, Mona?
Mona: Well, I have some business to attend to here, so I booked a hotel in the city. I was just out for a stroll... when I bumped into you. Quite unexpectedly, if I might add.
Mona: Why did you think I was from Fontaine, though? Is that because "Megistus" doesn't sound much like a Mondstadter surname?
Paimon: Yeah, let's go with that!
Mona: Well, I used to have my own surname, which was, well, some other thing... Either way, the old hag told me when she took me as her disciple that the first step to being a Great Astrologist's pupil was to change that name.
Mona: There was nothing for it, really. She really is amazing at astrology, so I changed my name to what it is now according to her wishes. To my surprise, however, "Megistus" is not the name of some ancient house or clan.
Paimon: Huh? It isn't?
Mona: Nope. Although it is used by us in place of surnames, it generally just means "great."
Paimon: Wow, imagine including a boast in your name... Wait, are you gonna have to put that into your genealogy as well?
Mona: I reckon so. In any case, I'd give my disciple a name like this as well, if I were to take one.
Traveler: And may I ask what your master's name is?
Mona: Astromancer Barbeloth Trismegistus.
Paimon: Whoa, that's a long one... Does it also mean "great" or something?
Mona: My name means "Mona, the Great Astrologist." As for the old hag, hers is, in plain speech, "the thrice-as-great scholar of the stars." Just take it as a title specific to astrologists.
Paimon: Thrice-as-great!? That's so... petty!
Mona: I know, right? That's just how she is! She used to call herself Megistus, actually, but once she took me in, she changed her name to Trismegistus...
Paimon: Talk about excessive...
Mona: Megistus is thus the calling card of our school, so to speak, which makes it about the same as a surname. It's alright if you don't get it — you can look into it further should you need to study astrology more deeply.
Traveler: How about "Triple-Strength-Traveler"...
Paimon: That sounds terrible!
Paimon: But anyway, you're not Fontainian, are you, Mona? You're from Mondstadt, right?
Mona: Well, I was born in Mondstadt, yes. My parents migrated to Dornman Port, and I traveled with the old hag for a while, after which I settled down in Mondstadt City.
Paimon: Oh, that's a good thing then! At least we know you won't be dissolved by Fontaine's waters.
Mona: Hmm, speaking of that, I'm sure you're aware that a bunch of things have happened here in Fontaine, right? I know you're not a local, but I'd avoid getting too close to any water that looks strange all the same.
Mona: There's something ominous about it... The water, I mean.
Traveler: Did you come to Fontaine because of the prophecy, Mona?
Mona: That was the main reason, yes. Just a while back, The Steambird invited me to take part in a panel and speak about the circulation of the prophecy as an astrologist.
Mona: The invitation was sent quite early on. I don't think anyone expected Fontaine to be in this much trouble.
Paimon: What do you make of that prophecy, Mona? Just tell us what you think as an astrologist... Your word would go a long way to make things more certain and less... scary!
Mona: What I can tell you is that I'm an astrologist, and that this prophecy concerns the fate of Fontaine, even that of all Teyvat. Ascertaining this is akin to reading the fortune of the whole world.
Mona: I'm afraid that this is not something that just anyone can do. If I could do it, you would no longer call me an astrologist... but a visionary.
Mona: But on the flip side, the prophecy is so huge and powerful that it must surely come from a powerful visionary. Its contents involve the fate of the world... Disregarding it would be a mistake.
Paimon: A visionary... Sounds really powerful and all, but does such a person really exist?
Mona: Of course. The old hag could do it, and I'd bet there are others amongst those Hexenzirkel colleagues of hers who could do something similar.
Traveler: I need to ascertain the accuracy of the prophecy.
Mona: Huh? A—Are you sure?
Mona: Hmm... Alright, I'll help you. It isn't often that I see you with such a serious look on your face. I'll tell you once I hear back from her.
Paimon: Thanks, Mona! You're amazing as always.
Mona: Hehe. Well, this is something only I can do, after all. So yes, your praises are quite welcome!
Paimon: That's the greatest of astrologists for you! Of all the people we know, you know the stars the best.
Mona: Indeed, indeed! That's the spirit.
Tetreaux: Oh, sorry. I came to see what all the commotion was about... If there is anything you need, do not hesitate to inform the Spina di Rosula.
Mona: Uh... Whoops, guess we were getting a little too carried away there. Well, I'll go tend to my own business now. If I receive any news, I'll be sure to come find you two again!
Paimon: And there she goes, quick as rushing water... And here we are with this Spina guy giving us suspicious looks.
Traveler: Well, we were making a ruckus.
Paimon: Right, but we were able to recruit Mona's help, didn't we? Our Fontainian friends will thank us someday.
Black Screen Text: After the conversation, you decide to get a good night's sleep to replenish your energy...
Paimon: *yawn* Good morning... To be honest, Paimon's still feeling kinda sleepy.
Paimon: But it's time to get up, Traveler! We agreed to go see Neuvillette, so let's pack it up and get going.
Traveler: Try to keep it down next time, Paimon.
Paimon: Hah! If Paimon hadn't spoken for you, it'd be you getting all the weird looks! Hmph. The things Paimon does for you...
Traveler: Alright, alright. Thanks, Paimon.
Paimon: Hehe... That's more like it!
Traveler: Could you help me get in touch with your master?
Traveler: Or "Triple-Appetite-Paimon"...

## Talk 2

Sedene: Y—You're here! Finally!
Paimon: Uh, is something wrong?
Sedene: Monsieur Neuvillette and Lady Furina... they seem to have gotten into a dispute! Please, go see for yourself.
Furina: Like I said, I've already explained everything!
Neuvillette: And yet, the problem has not been properly solved. There is little space for excuses between us.
Neuvillette: It is not my intention to offend you, but please, tell me where you stand. You are the Hydro Archon Focalors, are you not?
Neuvillette: Look at this. This is a list of the victims from the recent Poisson incident.
Furina: ...
Furina: Y—You mean... They're all...
Neuvillette: We did not arrive in time to avert this disaster, and I will not have it happen again.
Furina: ...
Neuvillette: I will say this once more. You must tell me everything you know.
Neuvillette: Yesterday, I found three stone slates in some ancient ruins near Poisson. Do you know anything about those?
Furina: ...Seriously? You're questioning me like this is a court case now. I don't know anything about that.
Furina: But... you found them in some ancient ruins, you say?
Neuvillette: That's correct, which is why I came to ask you some questions. There should have been four slates, but one of them was missing. The other three feature different images that seem to correlate to the prophecy.
Furina: The prophecy...
Neuvillette: The second of these slates depicts the previous Hydro Archon Egeria kneeling before a floating island in the sky, as if confessing something. Do you know nothing of this, either?
Furina: I don't. I've never seen such slates.
Neuvillette: I'll ask you again... Do you really have no information regarding the previous Archon?
Neuvillette: My deciphering of the slates indicates that the Hydro Archon Egeria once had to confess to, or apologize for, a certain sin. If anyone would know about it, it should be you.
Furina: All gods don't have the same secrets, you know. She was herself, and I'm me. Is it really so strange that I know nothing?
Furina: I understand your concerns, but... I'm sorry. I just don't have anything to tell you.
Neuvillette: ...
Neuvillette: Forgive me for saying this now, Lady Furina, but I have long known of your various secret investigations into certain matters.
Neuvillette: There are several indications that you have been investigating the prophecy on the sly.
Neuvillette: This is not strange in itself, considering that you are the Hydro Archon. But it is strange that you also should claim not to know any of Egeria's secrets, as well as do nothing following your inquiries.
Neuvillette: You have never been as superficial as you have presented yourself to be, nor are you a fool. And yet, your behavior is very inconsistent...
Furina: Haha... Hahahaha! So you've been watching me all this time, have you? I didn't think you were that type!
Neuvillette: You...
Furina: Well, since you know about my secret investigations, then you should know I'm actually working to take care of it.
Furina: There's no point questioning or suspecting me. You're the Iudex, but you're still my subordinate — you should be following my lead.
Furina: Just trust in me, your Archon, and do as I say — never mind whether you can truly convince yourself to or not. It'll all turn out fine.
Furina: ...That's all I have to say. We do not discuss this matter again.
Furina: Ah, the opera's about to start. Toodles!
Neuvillette: ...
Paimon: Did Furina not notice us standing by the door? Wonder what's up with her. She was smiling... Huh, she didn't seem in the mood to care if we were listening in or not...
Traveler: She seems deeply troubled...
Neuvillette: I assume you've been outside for a while now?
Paimon: Oh, you noticed? Seems Furina didn't even realize we were here.
Neuvillette: She was in a great panic, though I cannot discern the reason. Our discussion reached impasses time and again — a state of affairs that we cannot allow to continue.
Neuvillette: Still, I do not understand. Dialogue is the basis for understanding, so why did she keep refusing to engage?
Traveler: I'm afraid questions alone might not suffice...
Traveler: We need to make her understand how dire the situation actually is.
Neuvillette: Everyone in her inner circle has noticed that she is hiding some secret. The issue is her attitude. I fear that she will not reveal anything unless absolutely forced to.
Neuvillette: We may have to create a situation in which she will have no choice but to speak.
Paimon: Oh? Like what?
Neuvillette: Normally, people will only reveal the truth when standing trial. Perhaps we must have the Hydro Archon experience just such a scenario.
Paimon: But Furina's seen so many trials, and she's really good at dodging questions. How do we make sure that she won't just slip away at the first chance she gets?
Neuvillette: We will need to consider this thoroughly, join forces with various parties, and then do what we can.
Neuvillette: ...
Neuvillette: If at all possible, I would prefer to recuse myself from this affair, but... We must prevent the prophecy from coming to pass.
Neuvillette: This may be cruel to her, but all Fontaine is in crisis — the "information a god possesses" is too precious, and so we must take a chance on this.
Traveler: In that case, we will need help.
Neuvillette: But who will lend us their aid to do such a thing?
Traveler: Oh, I think I know who to call.
Traveler: She seems to be deliberately hiding something...

## Talk 3

Traveler: Lady Megistus!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Well, that's everyone, huh?
Paimon: Speaking of which, it was pretty smart of you to think of hiding here.
Lynette: Poisson was just involved in a disaster, so it's presently devoid of people. That naturally makes it the best choice.
Paimon: And here you are, drinking tea like it's the most natural thing in the world, huh?
Lynette: That's what family should do — sit and enjoy a leisurely time together.
Lyney: Haha. It's nice to enjoy tea here, you know. Care for a cup?
Navia: Ahem! Lend me your ears, everyone... Hmm. Or perhaps one of you might like to start us off? How about you, friend?
Freminet: Uh, me!? N—No, I don't think I can...
Navia: Then, how about you, good sir?
Neuvillette: I fear that I will cause the mood on this boat to become as somber as it is in court...
Navia: Well then, I guess we're lucky we've got a local like me to organize things. Wonderful — the spotlight, at last! I guess I'll be facilitating things from here.
Clorinde: That was a little long-winded, don't you think?
Navia: #Oh, you might be right... Anyway, to cut to the chase, our friend here, {NICKNAME}, has brought us together to discuss something.
Navia: As for what that is... Well, let's start by saying that we'll be pooling our efforts together to create a series of "traps."
Lyney: Oh? How intriguing.
Navia: Well, it's just an expression, really — one that I just learned from Clorinde, and used on the spot... so let's invite her to explain in detail. A round of applause, please!
Clorinde: Huh? Didn't you say that you would be facilitating this?
Navia: Oh, come now, your work doesn't involve much public speaking, right? This is a good chance to practice — you might even pick up some fancy oratory tricks to impress your boss with in the future.
Clorinde: I see. And what does my boss say?
Neuvillette: Ahem... He is glad that you consider him your boss. Do go on.
Clorinde: In that case, do any of you have experience in... hunting?
Lynette: Not that I recall.
Lyney: Freminet and I once used a wooden stick and a basket to catch wild rabbits when we were younger. As for Lynette... Ah right, you were sick that day, weren't you?
Freminet: I've also gone diving to catch some fish before. Does that count?
Clorinde: I'm afraid not. You may or may not have heard, but Fontaine once played host to a group known as the Marechaussee Hunters.
Clorinde: Though that was their name, they did not hunt animals, but rather various monsters left behind by the ancient dynasty of King Remus.
Clorinde: Today, Fontaine's monster population has already thinned greatly, so the Hunters have blended back into society, taking up arms in other lines of work. They even left a unique methodology of hunting in their wake.
Clorinde: A trap comprises of the following components: bait, a trigger, and a containment device. Sometimes, a lethal implement will also be necessary to deal with the prey.
Clorinde: So if we were to build a trap together right now, what would you choose to build it with?
Lyney: For me, I would prefer something basket-shaped. Pigeons and rabbits will see the bait and naturally enter the snare.
Lyney: Our line of work requires a deft hand, and we're some of the best in the industry, so you can count on our techniques.
Navia: You used some of those techniques while moving the people of Poisson, didn't you? My subordinates mentioned that you even performed some magic for the bawling children.
Lyney: Yes, and I even managed to gather some intelligence in the meantime — I'm quite the multitasker if I do say so myself.
Freminet: I'm afraid I can't claim that as my strong suit... I prefer more stable methods, like placing bait in the water and waiting for the fish to come within reach... That's the kind of method I would count on.
Paimon: Hehe, calm and steady — exactly the kind of person who would catch loads of fish.
Lynette: And I can be their assistant.
Clorinde: With discretion, I'm sure.
Navia: Hmm... I'd probably use some sort of mechanical animal. Papa once bought me some small clockwork squirrels, mice, and such. When placed in the forest, they can attract others of their kind.
Navia: I remember that you liked those too, didn't you?
Clorinde: I did, and that would be a good way to go about it. If they're realistic enough, animals of the same kind will follow them all the way to the trap.
Navia: What about you, Monsieur Neuvillette?
Neuvillette: I... fear I do not have any related experience.
Clorinde: That makes sense. You usually solve problems directly, without the use of any such tricks.
Clorinde: But I do have one more question for you, Monsieur.
Clorinde: If we were to create a trap now, how would you design it?
Neuvillette: Hmm, I would like for it to be effective but bring no harm to the prey. A more gentle trap would be ideal.
Clorinde: Kind, as always. However, our intention doesn't necessarily change the containment device and the type of implement we need.
Clorinde: If we wanted to kill the prey in one strike, we would need a powerful implement. However, that also goes for prey that must be captured and safely contained.
Navia: Wait, why's that?
Clorinde: Only a hunter who is a true expert at subduing their prey can snare it without harming it. The line that divides life and death is often exceedingly thin.
Freminet: ...So, are we going hunting together?
Paimon: Uh, we hadn't thought of seeing ourselves as hunters. It kinda works... but maybe it's still not the best metaphor.
Neuvillette: If our means of capturing and dealing with our prey is to put them on trial, then the hunting metaphor is actually quite accurate.
Neuvillette: But we shall require much more courage than any hunter to judge a god — a being whose seat is an exalted throne.
Traveler: That's right.
Lyney: Oh, so that's what is going on... sounds very interesting.
Black Screen Text: Clorinde's hunting metaphor was just that... a metaphor.
You will not call this a "hunt" because that is not what you should do at present, nor has the relationship between you and Furina reached such a dire stage.
Black Screen Text: What you need is simply the secrets she is keeping.
Attempting to take her secrets is an act of sacrilegious disrespect, but must be done to prevent Fontaine from sinking into the waters as foretold in the prophecy.
Black Screen Text: There is neither hunter nor prey, but there must be a "trap."
That is what you will need.

## Talk 5

Mage "N": Ah, so you've caught on.
Mage "N": Just as prophecies are usually only the future as seen from the perspectives of the gods, could things be happening in hidden corners where the gods' gaze does not fall?
Mage "N": Are the things that you shall see different from the fate that the gods perceive?
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Wh—What is she talking about? It all sounds really impressive and important and stuff... but it also sounds kinda scary.
Traveler: (The tea in the teacup is just about gone as well...)
Mage "N": I believe that you understand, right? Some things are insignificant... but others, you must reach out to change.
Mage "N": Ultimately, fate shall serve as your only guide no matter what will happen in Teyvat's future. All you need to do is to play your part.
Mage "N": This was good tea, by the way. Thank you for your hospitality. Well, that'll be all for today.
Paimon: The voice... it's gone.
Traveler: (Mage N... is this the clue you're leaving for us?)

## Talk 6

Paimon: That's right! Paimon's glad to hear something sensible for once.
Mona: Ah, yes. About what we had discussed before... I did try, but I'm afraid I couldn't reach the old hag. I'll try again tonight, but I wouldn't get your hopes up...
Traveler: Actually, someone already came over...
Mona: Huh?
Black Screen Text: You tell Mona about your mysterious guest...
Mona: Goodness gracious... Are you serious?
Traveler: I believe she came to pass a message to us.
Paimon: She said that even the gods' gaze has blindspots — pretty bold if you ask Paimon. Most people would believe the gods to be all-knowing, right?
Mona: The Hexenzirkel members are certainly anything but ordinary. As for the mage named N... The old hag has mentioned her a few times. She said that N's sense of direction is incredible, and that she loves guiding those who are lost.
Mona: But I've never met her, and if she were still alive, she'd be... Well, suffice it to say that the hag's at least a few hundred now, and N's been around for longer than that!
Paimon: Whoa... The Hexenzirkel sounds like a scary group... But they must really stay in shape to live so long!
Mona: Their abilities alone are pretty terrifying. If she came to see you personally, then the problem you're facing must truly be of great importance.
Paimon: Well, it's not like Paimon could understand anything she said.
Mona: Yes, she was quite cryptic, but I suspect she means that there is still a way to turn things around. She didn't say when or what that would be, though, so...
Mona: Perhaps it is something that you cannot know right now...
Traveler: (True. Her words were meant as a helpful hint, but when will we realize their value and meaning...?)
Traveler: (Was that the best answer that my question could have gotten?)
Mona: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, are you two alright?
Paimon: Oh, we're fine, we're just a little down right now... It kinda feels like the end is coming, you know?
Mona: I see. I feel that same sense of desperation, too.
Mona: I guess you could consider me someone who has often witnessed "fate." So far as I have seen, it cannot be swayed.
Mona: But even so, I still hope for — and believe in — miracles. Astrology is eternal and rational, but fate may not be. It is cruel... but it can also be beautiful.
Mona: Perhaps that's what N was trying to tell you. Not to lose heart, and to believe that what you were seeing playing out before you is not yet set in stone.
Mona: I did originally think of steering clear of all this, but I couldn't. Even if this is all futile, I still wish to help everyone. If we don't struggle to the last, then how can we face the end when it comes?
Paimon: Huh. You do have a point...
Mona: *sigh* Haha, there I go talking about astrological principles again. Sorry about that, the moment I start talking about work-related stuff... Oh, I need to get going!
Traveler: Don't worry about it, Mona — and thank you.
Mona: It was worth trying to comfort you, even if only a little. I believe that you'll help those who're struggling in the same way I did.
Mona: I suppose that might be why we always seem to meet by coincidence.
Paimon: Paimon feels kinda moved by what Mona said... but also kinda sad, too.
Paimon: #Hey, {NICKNAME}... Paimon suddenly feels like going outside for a walk. Let's go.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Huh? Our names are written in this newspaper. Uh, what's going on?
Traveler: Maybe we're famous?
Paimon: Let Paimon see...
Paimon: "The underwater stronghold, the Fortress of Meropide, has continued in its noble autonomy, but that does not mean that others cannot interact with it."
Paimon: "My recent attempts to enter the Fortress bore little fruit..." Huh? Guess Charlotte still hasn't given up on that...
Paimon: #"Thus did an outlander friend become the focus of this report — a {M#blond}{F#blonde} adventurer with their white fairy, legends trailing in their wake. It is said that this mysterious traveler once visited the underwater Fortress."
Paimon: "So while the Fortress's interior remains a mystery behind closed doors, do not fear, for the tales of the Traveler contain surprises in spades!"
Paimon: "Journalist Charlotte's biggest scoop yet — 'The Traveler's Trail: World-Walker.'"
Paimon: Huh? Charlotte took so many awesome photos of us, and we never even noticed her!
Paimon: She hasn't been able to get ahold of anything at the Fortress, so since we're easier to find, she's using us as the subject matter instead?
Traveler: That sure seems to be the case...
Paimon: Ugh, seriously... Well, fine. Those headlines and photos do look cool, so Paimon will forgive her this time!

## Talk 8

Mage "N": Ah, have you forgotten me already?
Paimon: Wait... You *are* familiar... You're the voice we heard from the sky in Sumeru!
Mage "N": "The voice from the sky," hmm? I fear that description is wrong — though not completely wrong.
Mage "N": You're feeling lost now, just as you were feeling previously. I sensed that confusion, and thus came to you. Guiding people is an irresistible hobby of mine, after all.
Traveler: Who are you? And what do you want with us?
Mage "N": Consider me a passerby, just accepting a commission from my friend's disciple on a whim.
Traveler: Allow me to ask you...
Mage "N": The prophecy... Yes, what has been prophesized will be fulfilled. You may view such things as "the history of the future."
Paimon: What... Th—Then, is there any way we can stop it?
Mage "N": I believe you have witnessed a failed attempt with your own eyes. Can everything in Teyvat so easily be changed?
Traveler: There it is again... "fate."
Traveler: Can there really be no exceptions?
Traveler: Will Fontaine's prophecy come true?

## Talk 9

Paimon: Hey, quick! Look... That's...
Paimon: That's the limited-edition, only 16-slices-a-day cake!
Traveler: It hasn't already sold out for the day?
Paimon: It was so delicious the last time we tried it, despite the tense situation we were in. Let's give it another go — Paimon's sure it'll be great!
Traveler: We can't let anyone get ahead of us!
Sedene: One slice of cake, please.
Paimon: Ah! Someone showed up after all!
Paimon: Oh? Wait, you're the one from the Palais Mermonia...
Sedene: Oh, are you here to buy cake too? Haha, it seems Monsieur Neuvillette was right — you really can eat.
Paimon: Wait, did he really say something like that?
Sedene: That's right. Even he has his own preferences when it comes to food. As for me, I love the cake and coffee here.
Paimon: Do you come here often?
Sedene: Mhm, usually every day.
Paimon: Every day...
Sedene: It's part of my daily schedule apart from work — I shall have my cake and coffee.
Paimon: ...
Paimon: Then what if someone told you one day that this place would be closing soon, and you wouldn't get to eat cake here anymore? What would you think?
Sedene: But why would it close?
Paimon: Well, Paimon doesn't know either, but maybe... Maybe the waters will rise tomorrow... You know, like in the prophecy.
Sedene: Oh, the prophecy... To be honest, I haven't paid much attention to that. No. Still, even if there'd be no more cake tomorrow, that wouldn't keep me from having some today.
Sedene: No no. It's the same for eating in general. You might not be able to eat tomorrow, but if you can do so today, then you should carry on. That's what people call "living," you know?
Paimon: ...Huh.
Sedene: Don't be sad. Excuse me, could I have two more slices of cake to go?
Sedene: These two slices are for you. Sigewinne said that this kind of expression you're making is what humans call "being sad."
Paimon: Oh, you know Sigewinne?
Sedene: I sure do. She was born before me, and she sometimes comes to the surface to teach us things about humans.
Sedene: She said that humans are creatures that are saddened easily, yes, and you can only lift their spirits by feeding them delicious food — so, please try the cakes here.
Sedene: I've got something else to do, so I'll be going now. You two try to stay in a good mood after eating, alright? Bye.
Paimon: And there she goes...
Paimon: Alright, let's dig in. Paimon's sure this cake will be delicious.
Black Screen Text: You share a glance with Paimon and snarf down the cake.
Paimon: It's more delicious than last time — and the flavor gets even better with a sip of tea! It sure would be nice if we could come again tomorrow...
Paimon: ...Sure would be nice if we could always eat delicious food here.

## Talk 10

Mage "N": Ah, have you forgotten me already?
Paimon: Wait... You *are* familiar... You're the voice we heard from the sky in Sumeru!
Mage "N": "The voice from the sky," hmm? I fear that description is wrong — though not completely wrong.
Mage "N": You're feeling lost now, just as you were feeling previously. I sensed that confusion, and thus came to you. Guiding people is an irresistible hobby of mine, after all.
Traveler: Who are you? And what do you want with us?
Mage "N": Consider me a passerby, just accepting a commission from my friend's disciple on a whim.
Traveler: (Friend's disciple... So, this is one of the friends of Mona's master? The enigmatic N of the Hexenzirkel?)
Traveler: Allow me to ask you...
Mage "N": The prophecy... Yes, what has been prophesized will be fulfilled. You may view such things as "the history of the future."
Paimon: What... Th—Then, is there any way we can stop it?
Mage "N": I believe you have witnessed a failed attempt with your own eyes. Can everything in Teyvat so easily be changed?
Traveler: There it is again... "fate."
Traveler: Can there really be no exceptions?
Traveler: Will Fontaine's prophecy come true?

## Talk 11

Charlotte: So she mentioned me? What did she say?
Paimon: She said that you're a real "daredevil" of a journalist!
Charlotte: Hahaha, nice — in which case, can this daredevil journalist dare to request an exclusive interview with the legendary Traveler and Paimon?
Paimon: Huh? So your article in the paper today doesn't count?
Charlotte: Oh, of course it doesn't — that was more like live photography. What I'd like to do is dive deeper and ask you to talk about the things you've seen and experienced.
Traveler: You seriously want to interview me?
Paimon: Yeah! Are we even... qualified enough?
Charlotte: Why not? If I say you're worth an interview, then you're worth it! But not right now, of course. I'll need a few days to prepare.
Paimon: Oh, in that case, we'll just chat when you have time then?
Charlotte: So that's a "yes"? Splendid! I'll tell the editor-in-chief immediately. I'll have to apply for lighting, a venue, some props, and...
Charlotte: Whew, so much to get done now. Talk to you later!
Paimon: Wait, Charlotte! Paimon's still got a question for you!
Charlotte: Hmm? What's that...?
Paimon: If, just for example, Fontaine were to be flooded tomorrow, what would you do today?
Charlotte: Huh, that's the prophecy you're talking about, isn't it...? I mean, I do hear about it often, but I've never once thought that the day could be tomorrow.
Charlotte: If you're seriously asking, then I might try and think of a way to leave Fontaine. But I'm still a journalist first and foremost. That means I have a duty to be reporting from the scene. And secondly... I wouldn't forsake my homeland that easily.
Charlotte: From what I've seen, most people don't know what they'd do should the worst come to pass. In truth, it might be better just to behave like normal rather than worry over such an end.
Charlotte: So in all likelihood, I'd probably still be prepping at the office for that interview of ours. I know what you're thinking... that sounds a bit sad, but I've always believed that it's best to do what you enjoy.
Charlotte: Just think about it! If this nation really were to be suddenly destroyed tomorrow, but I still successfully finish an exclusive interview with a truly unique person, then the story I would wind up writing would truly be timeless.
Charlotte: And then do you know what I'd do? Well, I'd write that story, send it for printing, and use messenger pigeons to get copies out to the various nations as soon as possible.
Charlotte: I'm not a dreamer, nor am I a workaholic, but I do love my job, and I'd be proud of leaving such an article behind. I guess you could say that I was born to be a journalist...
Charlotte: But anyway, that's my answer — and on that note, I'll get back to my preparations!
Paimon: That's so nice. All of a sudden, Paimon actually kinda envies her.
Paimon: Anyway, let's go and take a look at the sea, shall we?

## Talk 12

Paimon: *yawn* Feels like you'll grow mold if you stay here long enough...
Paimon: But it's still better than the Fortress of Meropide, that's for sure. It's not only damp there, but salty, too...
Isadora: Ah, so the two of you are still here. Wonderful.
Paimon: Ooh, you're from the Palais Mermonia, aren't you?
Isadora: Yes, I'm Isadora. Monsieur Neuvillette sent me to look for you two before... I heard that afterward, you went to the Fortress of Meropide.
Traveler: Err... So are you under the impression that we might be wanted criminals?
Isadora: Haha, not at all. I'm well aware that you're friends of his. Actually, I'm here to pass along a message from him...
Traveler: Let's hear it.
Isadora: Yes, inside the opera house. The Marechaussee Phantom has declared the incident a small-scale riot.
Paimon: A riot?
Isadora: Well, that said, I don't personally think it was that serious.
Isadora: Lady Furina was watching a performance at the opera house, and while she was resting during an intermission, some other audience members suddenly started harassing her...
Isadora: Loudly accusing her of doing nothing about the "prophecy crisis."
Isadora: And before she could respond, others started to join in.
Isadora: The crowd continued to grow and protests against the Hydro Archon started to break out.
Paimon: So, people have started to put the blame on Furina... Guess they finally found an outlet for the pressure they've been under due to the prophecy.
Isadora: I agree. People will naturally rely on gods as is customary, but the moment people feel threatened, gods are also the first to be blamed.
Paimon: So what happened after that? Is Furina okay?
Isadora: Seeing that the situation was spiraling out of control and that further argument was pointless, she claimed that she'd "gotten tired of this" and left in a hurry.
Isadora: The Marechaussee Phantom had their hands full maintaining order and did not catch where Lady Furina had gone. Only when things had stabilized did we realize that she had gone missing.
Paimon: So, you mean she's still missing?
Isadora: That's right. The Marechaussee has dispatched many people to search for her, but we don't have any leads yet.
Isadora: That said, I don't think there's much to worry about. She is a god, after all. Even if she were to fall into the hands of rioters, what could ordinary people do to her?
Traveler: I understand the situation.
Isadora: Good. Monsieur Neuvillette sent me to tell you about the situation, but he didn't say anything else...
Paimon: Don't worry, this is more than enough to go on. Thanks for keeping us informed!
Isadora: Ah, is that so? Well, alright then. In that case, you two take care. I'll be heading back to the Palais now.
Paimon: Well, sounds like we should hurry over to Poisson, then.
Traveler: You sure caught on quickly.
Paimon: If we know Furina, she won't try to fix things in this situation. Instead, she'll look for a place to wait out the heat.
Paimon: And as we also know, she may be loud and dramatic, but she doesn't have a heart of stone.
Paimon: When Neuvillette was talking to her in the Palais Mermonia, and she heard about Poisson, she couldn't hide her sadness and remorse.
Paimon: It would be hard for her to ignore being accused by the public today.
Paimon: Paimon thinks Furina's probably taken the opportunity to slip away to Poisson and try to relieve the sense of guilt that she's feeling.
Paimon: Heh... Well, whaddya think? Paimon knows the answer, of course, but Paimon can do the analysis to back it up too. Cool, huh?
Traveler: I see becoming a detective's done you some good.
Paimon: In that case, there's not a moment to lose. Poisson, here we come!
Traveler: Looks like those detective novels have had an effect on you.
Traveler: Did something happen?
