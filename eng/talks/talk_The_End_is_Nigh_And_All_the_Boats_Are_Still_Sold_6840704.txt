The Steambird Knowledge Section: "The End is Nigh? And All the Boats Are Still Sold Out?"
The Steambird Knowledge Section: "The water level is rising rapidly! Fontaine's apocalypse has come!" Such language is spreading throughout Fontaine like a plague, and inducing panic in all who hear it.
The Steambird Knowledge Section: Even the famous "Maestro of Environmental Salons" has weighed in, saying that if the water levels continue to rise, than all of Fontaine will be drowned, never to be seen again. The end is upon us!
The Steambird Knowledge Section: Researchers from the Fontaine Research Institute have also pointed out: "Based on the current speed that water levels are rising, we calculate that Fontaine will only be completely submerged in a hundred thousand years or so. It might be a bit premature to buy up boats now."
