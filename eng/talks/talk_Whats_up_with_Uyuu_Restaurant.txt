Traveler: What's up with Uyuu Restaurant?
Shimura Kanbei: Hmph, what about them? They've been just around a bit longer than us, have a little more staff than us and have classier decorations... Well, and the owner has a better background. That's all there is to their popularity!
Shimura Kanbei: I walked past that place several days ago, and they insisted on inviting me in. Of course, I knew they were just testing me!
Shimura Kanbei: My restaurant is just at the, uh, start-up stage! Just give me a bit of time, and I'll be better than them for sure!
