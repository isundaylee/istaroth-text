# The Illumiscreen: II


## Talk 1

Brother Qian: Try the Illumiscreen...
Traveler: Huh? These lanterns...
Brother Qian: Ah, it's you. You've come at a good time. I've changed to a new set of lanterns since the last time you were here.
Brother Qian: Fancy giving it a try, seeing if you can solve this one? It won't be as easy as last time.
Traveler: Why? Is the image more complex?
Brother Qian: No, no. The image is easy to spot, and there are still only three parts to combine.
Brother Qian: The difficulty this time has to do with the lantern rotation part.
Brother Qian: Okay, so, the image to make today is *Mora*. Remember, you have to get the right image first before you can go looking for the treasure.
Traveler: Is the lantern rotation more difficult?
Brother Qian: Hehehe, this time the three lanterns are *linked together*.
Brother Qian: To put it simply, when you rotate a lantern, there's a possibility that one of the other ones will rotate, too.
Brother Qian: Give it a go, you'll see what I mean.

## Talk 2

Brother Qian: How is the treasure hunt going?
Traveler: I've found every last chest.
Brother Qian: All of it? You're quite the expert treasure hunter, then... Plenty of people give up and walk off after the first try...
Brother Qian: Since you found all the treasure... Please take these as your prize. Happy Lantern Rite!

## Talk 3

Brother Qian: The treasure has all been prepared specially by the Guild. Happy hunting.

## Talk 4

Brother Qian: If you'd like to have a try, please come back at nighttime.

## Talk 5

Brother Qian: The image to try and make today is *Mora*.

## Talk 6

Brother Qian: You've solved it already? You're becoming very good at this very quickly. Go and study the image, there's a treasure clue hidden in it.
