## Talk

Trow: Hello there. There are no ongoing performances or trials at present, so there's no need to stay here for too long.

## Talk

Traveler: Won't you be lonely here all by yourself?
Trow: Hmm? Not at all.
Trow: Sometimes, many people come here, and the place is incredibly crowded. At other times, it is just like it is now, empty as can be.
Trow: Reminds you of the tides lapping against the shore, doesn't it?
Trow: And with these tides for company, I'm not lonesome at all.

## Talk

Traveler: I see.
Trow: Sure. The exit's over there, by the way.

## Talk

Traveler: That's really amazing of Melusine.
Trow: Thank you for the compliment, but you didn't just say that for me to let my guard down, did you?
Trow: Hmm... Judging from your attitude, you're not teasing me.
Trow: Then I'll let you in on a little secret. I actually prefer when there is no tide.
Trow: I used to live by the sea. Back then, I always dove into the sea to collect Romaritime Flowers when the tide was calm.
