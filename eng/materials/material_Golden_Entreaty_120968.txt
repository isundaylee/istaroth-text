# Golden Entreaty

A white disc retrieved from the ruins of the Sage of the Stolen Flame. It is one of the essential tokens required to journey to the Great Volcano of Tollan and remove the "Flamelord's Blessing" from the little Tepetlisaur's back. Golden inscriptions are etched into the surface of the white disc, and when touched, one can sense the intricate patterns pulsating as if imbued with life.
