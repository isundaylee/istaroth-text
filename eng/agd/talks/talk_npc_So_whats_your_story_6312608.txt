Traveler: So, what's your story?
Nathan: Me? Eh, I'm just an ordinary person from Mondstadt. I've never gotten any training, nor was I one of the Knights.
Nathan: If you've been to Mondstadt, you'd know that we lead a very laid back lifestyle.
Nathan: Personally, I can't accept the way the Shogunate's stripping others of their freedom. That's the reason why I'm so concerned about the current situation.
Nathan: Still, it's not like I've made a huge difference by joining the Sangonomiya faction either. I just try to help out as much as I can, haha.
