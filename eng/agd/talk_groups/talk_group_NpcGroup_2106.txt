Traveler: Tell me about Blackcliff Forge.
Gummer: Interested in the Forge? I'm quite the expert.
Gummer: I used to work here, but my body eventually couldn't keep up with the work inside. With a little luck, I was able to join the Millelith afterwards.
Gummer: In broad strokes, Blackcliff Forge is staffed by miners who smelt ores as they dig tunnels.
Gummer: Of course, we also reinforced the tunnels and built factories with safety considerations in mind.
Gummer: The bounty that Rex Lapis has bestowed upon Liyue all resides in this mine, and building factories within the mountain itself is the most efficient method of extracting that bounty.

Gummer: While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail!
