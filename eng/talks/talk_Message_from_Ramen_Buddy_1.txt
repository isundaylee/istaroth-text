Traveler: Message from "Ramen Buddy":
Bulletin Board: "What a lovely surprise. I didn't think the mighty Arataki Itto would still remember his old ramen buddy."
Bulletin Board: "A glorious drumming festival on a deserted little island. It'd be a pity to miss out on such an interesting event."
Bulletin Board: "So of course, the moment I received your invitation, I couldn't get myself here fast enough."
Bulletin Board: "In order to show my gratitude, I brought you a free all-you-can-eat ramen voucher for Yukio's food stall. I'm sure you can come up with some way to thank me."
Bulletin Board: "By the way, I should mention â€” the voucher is only valid for the Fried Tofu meal deal."
