Wei: Mr. Qiang! I wish to purchase a weapon for self-defense, as I shall be embarking on a journey within the foreseeable future! What would you advise for someone of my stature?
Mr. Qiang: Let's see... A feeble gait, spindly legs, zero core strength, no fighting instinct, lily-livered; hopeless at offense and useless in defense...
Mr. Qiang: I would strongly advise you against buying a weapon from here, because of the disgrace you would surely bring to my store's reputation if you ever did have the misfortune of being set upon by bandits.
Wei: ...
Mr. Qiang: Ugh. Okay, well, look. A good-quality sword would be wasted on you, so I would strongly advise you to invest in a crossbow instead.
Wei: What I'm hearing you say is... I have a natural gift for archery. Is that...?
Mr. Qiang: Look lad, you're vastly overestimating your ability level here. My six-year-old grandson took this crossbow with him when we went hunting in the hills the other day, and he took down a half-decent-sized boar with it.
Mr. Qiang: Now. I admit you might not have his burly physique or martial prowess, and we have to factor in that you're a clumsy one, too. But if you were attacking from behind, with the element of surprise, I think that even you would have a one-in-ten chance of hitting your target armed with this thing.
Wei: ...That was incredibly painful to hear.
Mr. Qiang: Don't like what I have to say? I'm afraid if you want to be a fighter, you have to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, boy! Don't expect your confidence to come from other people fawning over you...
Wei: But... I don't want to be a fighter or anything, it's just for self-defense...
