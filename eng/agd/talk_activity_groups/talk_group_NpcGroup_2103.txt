Herbalist Gui: Are you looking to buy some medicine? In that case, please give me your prescription.

## Talk

Traveler: I want to buy some herbs.
Herbalist Gui: Do you have a prescription? If you don't, I'm afraid that I cannot provide you with some of the ingredients with stronger medicinal properties...

## Talk

Traveler: A prescription?
Herbalist Gui: Medicine can both help and harm. The key lies in the amount used.
Herbalist Gui: Use too little, and it has no effect. Use too much, and you could hurt yourself. A balance must be struck in order to heal.
Herbalist Gui: I have yet to finish my training, so I cannot simply take what ingredients I will.
Herbalist Gui: ...Regardless of whether this is about healing the sick, or simply about Master Baizhu and Bubu Pharmacy's good name, I cannot be careless about such things.
Traveler: I'd like to know about Bubu Pharmacy...
Herbalist Gui: As you've seen, this is the best pharmacy in Liyue. Thanks to Dr. Baizhu's extraordinary skills, we have an endless stream of customers who come to seek cures and get herbs every single day.
Herbalist Gui: Dr. Baizhu himself has a poor constitution, so the job of putting the medicines together falls to me, while Qiqi handles herb-picking...
Herbalist Gui: ...But as to what illness Dr. Baizhu has, I have no clue.
Herbalist Gui: He's been ill from the very first time I met him, and hasn't completely recovered since.
Herbalist Gui: Perhaps, it is as they say â€” "a physician cannot cure himself."

Traveler: See you.
Herbalist Gui: May you be in good health.
Herbalist Gui: Please do not simply ignore small ills and aches. If you don't take them seriously, they could become a hidden dagger behind your back.

Traveler: Has Qiqi's been using that medical fund of hers?
Herbalist Gui: Yes, of course. For patients who are strapped for cash, that money is a lifesaver.
Herbalist Gui: We even received quite a few anonymous donations afterwards. It seems that people heard of Qiqi's good deed, and wanted to do the same.
Herbalist Gui: It's just a shame that Qiqi has no recollection of what she did. Still, she seemed very happy when I told her that she'd helped a lot of people.
Traveler: She "seemed"?
Herbalist Gui: Heh, well, Qiqi's not the best at expressing herself. But if you spend enough time with her, you get a feel for how she's feeling too.
Herbalist Gui: Perhaps an example might help. She was as happy to hear that as she is when drinking coconut milk.
