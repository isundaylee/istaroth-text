# Tartaglia Voicelines

## Hello
I'm No. 11 of the Fatui Harbingers, codename Childe, but I also go by Tartaglia. And you... Hmm, you too like to cause quite the stir, don't you? Something tells me we're going to get along splendidly.

## Chat: Idleness
You know, there are better ways to seek out our enemies than... well, standing here.

## Chat: Test of Skills
This place is pretty dead... By which I mean, there's nothing to kill.

## Chat: The Fatui
I wonder what the rest of the Harbingers are up to? Plotting and scheming on an ever-grander scale, no doubt.

## Chat: Snezhnaya
Where I'm from, if we didn't keep moving, we'd freeze to death. Literally.

## After the Rain
Ah, perfect weather for fishing! The sound of the rain scares them away, but once it stops, they're yours for the taking.

## When It Snows: Foreign Country
Haha, ahh... could it be snowing in Snezhnaya too?

## When It Snows: Snezhnaya
The world looks glorious in the snow. Pure white, like the light of the moon. A perfect backdrop for bloodshed.

## When It's Windy
The wind is picking up. There is conflict in the air.

## When the Wind Is Blowing: Foreign Country
Just look at that wind blow!

## When the Wind Is Blowing: Snezhnaya
The wind permeates all, cleansing both mind and body. Excellent.

## Good Morning
Morning, comrade! You're raring to go today, I see.

## Good Afternoon
You look well. What's your secret? Care to exchange notes?

## Good Evening
Whew, dinner was quite the feast. A spot of exercise is in order.

## Good Night
Today was great. See you tomorrow, comrade!

## About Tartaglia
A warrior must always be ready to face any challenge with his blade. The outcome of the battle is irrelevant — what matters is that you learn from the experience.

## About Us: Comrades
Ah, I'm sure the Harbingers must know of my dealings with you by now. Oh, I'd love to see the look on their faces... Hahaha...

## About Us: Weapons
I am the least adept with a bow. And that is precisely why I must master it.

## About Us: Survival
You wield such powers without owning a Vision... I really am excited to see what you have in store for us... Let's see how far you can go. Just don't go dying on me before you lay it all on the line in our final battle! I won't allow it!

## About Us: Invitation
Comrade, how would you like to join the Fatui? ...Actually, scrap that. With your capabilities, you and I could go head-to-head with the Harbingers and win. Wouldn't want to miss an opportunity like that.

## About the Vision
If it makes me stronger, I'll take it. Vision? Great. Delusion? Don't mind if I do. Heretical teachings from the Abyss? Sign me up.

## Something to Share
The skeletal-white snowscape devours life without leaving any trace. It is the invisible enemy we fight against each day.

## Interesting Things
I once ventured deep into the abyss and came face-to-face with an enormous beast. I don't know its name, all I know is the sight of it chilled me to the bone. But mark my words, one day I will march back in there and behead that beast, and you, comrade, will be my witness!

## About Skirk
It's been years since I last saw my master. I should hope that next we meet, I'll at least be able to force her to use both hands to beat me...

## About Zhongli: Pondering
There's far more to that man than meets the eye. As for the extent of his power... lots to look forward to, I think.

## About Zhongli: Challenge
Tell me, how has Mr. Zhongli been lately? Not bad, you say? Seems he's had no problem acclimating to "mortal" life. Hmph, he sure had me fooled. Such a fiasco mustn't be so easily forgiven! The only way to reconciliation is fierce combat! What do you mean I'm no match for him? Hahaha...

## About the Tsaritsa
Her Royal Highness the Tsaritsa is actually a gentle soul. Too gentle, in fact, and that's why she had to harden herself. Likewise, she declared war against the whole world only because she dreams of peace. And because she made an enemy of the world, I had the chance to become acquainted with you.

## About Varka
Varka? Just the thought of one day going head-to-head with him in combat, the fabled Knight of Boreas himself, titan of the Knights of Favonius... It makes me buzz with excitement. It's a beautiful life we live in this world.

## About The Jester
He was the first ever Fatui Harbinger, and today he is our leader. He only appears on important occasions. As for his accomplishments... To be honest, I don't really care. I owe my loyalty and devotion to the Tsaritsa, no one else.

## About The Captain
I've seen him in battle before, and oh what a sight it was. Perhaps I'm ranked too low for him to notice me right now. Well, he may not recognize my strengths yet, but one day, I'll show him what I'm made of.

## About The Doctor
I heard that he took segments of himself at different ages, made prostheses out of them, and assigned different tasks to each one. I know... all my comrades are a little weird. Well, come to think of it, if I met another version of myself... Hah, we'd have to fight then and there to decide which one of us gets to survive.

## About Damselette
The Fatui Harbingers are ranked by strength, and I have no idea why that girl is No. 3. I'd test my skills with every Harbinger who ranks above me if I had the chance, but when it comes to her... something just doesn't feel right. Anyway, you should be careful around her.

## About The Knave
Look, I've got nothing against people who have their own agendas — I myself joined the Fatui to get more experience in combat. But I don't like her at all. If she stood to benefit from betraying others, she'd turn against the Tsaritsa in a heartbeat. There isn't a sane bone in her body.

## About The Rooster
I don't know what his motivations could be, but he seems genuine about wanting to help me. He treats me just like family. Oh, and speaking of family — Tonia and Teucer are always telling me about the pastries and other gifts he brings them when they write. So while I've been away from Snezhnaya, he's kept his promise to take care of my family.

## About Marionette
She always seems engrossed in her research. Hmm... I wonder if those machines have anything to do with her? Anyway, I've only met her a few times, but every time she looked like she wanted to murder me. I have no idea what I possibly could have done to annoy her, though.

## About Regrator
Oh, now that guy has a head full of grandiose plans fueled by raw ambition. I don't understand a word he says once he starts talking about his theories... Eh, but as long as he keeps our cash reserves stocked up, I'm not complaining.

## About The Fair Lady
I never got along with her, you know that. I guess there's not much more worth saying about her at this point. When you're a harbinger, you have to accept that death could come at any time... But don't worry about me. No matter what happens, I'll do whatever it takes to keep myself alive.

## About The Balladeer
After he took the Gnosis, we lost all contact with him. Now comes the task of trying to hunt it down and get it back... I actually don't mind it — it means I get to travel all over. Wonder if I'll run into you somewhere along the way?

## More About Tartaglia: I
Remember, comrade, one day I will conquer the world!

## More About Tartaglia: II
Face me in person, man to man, and I'll always have a chance of beating you. Same goes if you're a deity or a monster from the abyss. But the Harbingers? They are more enamored with their intangible methods, spending their days scheming and maneuvering. This is why we cannot get along.

## More About Tartaglia: III
However far away my motherland may be, we all live under the same sky. That snow-white moon... My family must be able to see it too. I hope my siblings... *sigh* I hope that they have turned out to be formidable warriors as well.

## More About Tartaglia: IV
Comrade, a word of advice: Don't go yelling stupid things in the heat of battle. They might sound good in your head, but if you think about it, they make no sense at all. I'm talking about things like, "I'm on fire!" That's the last thing we want. Fire leaves behind nothing but ashes. And you must survive at all costs.

## More About Tartaglia: V
Ah, how time flies. One day, you will see how I conquer the world and crush the thrones of gods beneath my heel. In the meantime... no dying, comrade! Keep yourself alive! Hahaha.

## Tartaglia's Hobbies
Ice fishing and combat follow the same principle. Patience and decisiveness are key. Though having said that... I suppose the same is true of everything in life.

## Tartaglia's Troubles
My pet peeves? Hmm, well, to be honest, I'm far too busy journeying with you and slaying powerful enemies to dwell on such trifling matters.

## Favorite Food
There's plenty of delicious food to sink your teeth into in this world... and plenty of fights to sink your teeth into as well. Life is beautiful.

## Least Favorite Food
Food is like weaponry. A true warrior never deliberates unduly over their choice of weapon, nor do they do so over the food they eat. Neither should you.

## Receiving a Gift: I
Eating delicious food really has a way of taking all your cares away. Now, how should I repay you?

## Receiving a Gift: II
Your cooking skills seem to have improved quite a lot. Does that mean you're getting stronger all the time, too?

## Receiving a Gift: III
Um, I'll admit the taste surprises me a little. Hmm? Okay... I'll try one more bite.

## Birthday
Happy birthday, comrade! Anyone you need knocked off their perch today? Let me know. I'll happily oblige...

## Feelings About Ascension: Intro
Hohoho, I feel like I've gotten stronger! Now, who shall I use as my guinea pig...

## Feelings About Ascension: Building Up
"A warrior's strength is like a dome. The bigger the dome, the more opponents he can challenge inside it." Hmm, who was it that said this again?

## Feelings About Ascension: Climax
Bravo, comrade! Thanks to your help, I am one step closer to my goal of conquering the world. I doubt even the Tsaritsa herself ever expected I would make it this far.

## Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion
Comrade. Make sure you keep training too. Otherwise, who will be left to fight me to the death when the world lies defeated at my feet? Hahaha.

## Low HP: II
You're pretty good!

## Low HP: III
Death looms. My time to shine!

## Ally at Low HP: I
What's the matter, out of practice?

## Ally at Low HP: II
Step aside, it's my turn!

## Fallen: I
How... I had only just...

## Fallen: II
Drat!

## Fallen: III
I'm... quite impressed...

## Heavy Hit Taken: I
Amateur mistake.
