# Delicious Poissonchant Pie

A fish pie. Fish fat sizzles near the dancing flame and then drips into the dough as the crust becomes golden and crispy. No one can resist the temptation to immediately have a try once the dish is freshly out of the oven. It feels as if the fish were singing a romantic and savory paean on the tip of your tongue.
