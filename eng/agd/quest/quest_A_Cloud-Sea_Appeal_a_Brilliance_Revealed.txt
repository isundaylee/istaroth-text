# A Cloud-Sea Appeal, a Brilliance Revealed


## Talk 1

Gaming: Oh! You're here early. I just ordered. The food should be out in a second. Sit down, sit down.
Paimon: Let's all take a seat.
Gaming: Here, hand me your cups.
Paimon: Oh, thank you!
Gaming: Wait! You weren't supposed to drink that, Paimon.
Gaming: That was for you to rinse your utensils.
Paimon: Huh? That's a thing?
Black Screen Text: As you talk, piping hot dim sum dishes arrive at the table one after another.
Paimon: Wow... So much delicious food. Do you really eat all this just for breakfast?
Gaming: Hehe, that's just how we do it where I'm from.
Gaming: Most of the time, though, I don't eat lunch after dim sum.
Paimon: That's good to hear. Paimon doesn't need to worry about holding back, then!
Gaming: Eat! Eat! If it's not enough, we can always order more. Oh, there's Tong Sui coming as well! I don't usually have that in the morning, but well, since everyone's here, I just had to order it.
Gaming: #What about you, Traveler? Is the food to your liking? Want some more seafood congee? Let me refill your bowl.
Traveler: That would be great, thanks.
Traveler: I'd be happy to do it myself.
Paimon: Paimon's gonna take you up on that! Fill it up nice and full, and make sure she gets a few extra shrimp. Thanks!
Black Screen Text: Everyone picks up their chopsticks and begins to dig in...
Paimon: Ah... So full. That meal was so satisfying, it even gave Paimon some extra brain juice.
Paimon: Listen, listen, Paimon's figured it out!
Traveler: Figured what out?
Paimon: Let's think about this for a second, Gaming. You invited us to this awesome restaurant and ordered a whole tableful of expensive dim sum just for the three of us... Well, you must be hiding the fact that you're some young master from a rich family!
Paimon: That would explain why you try to keep your friends and family away from each other.
Gaming: Haha, are you confusing me with Xingqiu?
Paimon: Huh? You know Xingqiu? You sure know a lot of people.
Gaming: Well, when you're on the road as much as I am, you hear all sorts of rumors. Sometimes they're true, sometimes they're not. What it comes down to is being able to tell the difference.
Gaming: More often than not, that means knocking on some doors to find out for yourself.
Paimon: Oh, you truly are a man of many talents, Young Master Gaming!
Gaming: Okay, okay. Enough with the teasing. Sorry to burst your bubble, Paimon, but you're wrong about my family situation.
Paimon: What!? Paimon thought she was on to something there...
Gaming: My dad is just an ordinary tea merchant. Small-scale stuff, you know? It wouldn't even make sense to mention his business in the same breath as the Feiyun Commerce Guild.
Gaming: My dad... *sigh* He always wanted me to inherit the family business, to be a merchant like him.
Gaming: But that's just not who I am. It's not who I ever wanted to be.
Traveler: (Gaming always seems so happy and carefree. This is the most serious I've ever seen him. This topic must be very important to him.)
Paimon: Have you ever talked to him about it?
Paimon: You know... about your interests and aspirations and stuff?
Gaming: Of course I have! I told him I wanted to be a Wushou dancer — that I wanted all of Teyvat to see what I could do!
Gaming: According to my dad, though, that wasn't a real job... Just a child's pipe-dream.
Paimon: Oh, that's terrible...
Gaming: I'm sure he thought I would come around eventually, but Wushou dancing has always been the only thing I wanted to do.
Gaming: One day, he tried to get me to visit some other tea merchants to start building the right relationships, but I refused to go. We got into a huge fight. We were this close to throwing hands.
Gaming: In the end, I was so angry that I... I ran away from home. I haven't been back since...
Gaming: Don't get on my case just yet, okay? It's not like I think I'm completely without fault.
Gaming: No... I know that it wasn't the right way to go about things.
Gaming: But my dad's stubborn. No matter how hard I tried to convince him, it just went in one ear and out the other. There was no changing his mind.
Gaming: I knew talking would only get me so far. But if I made it big in Liyue Harbor... The results could speak for themselves...
Paimon: Gaming...
Gaming: But... I'm sure you both already know how that's going. Wushou dancing's just not that big in Liyue Harbor.
Gaming: In the past, I would go door-to-door from store to store, asking if they would be interested in hiring a performer. Most times, I wound up eating nothing but humble pie, hehe...
Gaming: And you can't just rely on dreams to put food on the table, right? So I found a job as a guard to make some money, and now I have enough to get by and then some!
Gaming: ...Still, change takes time. Gotta take it slow, you know?
Paimon: Paimon understands...
Gaming: Okay! Enough of all that serious talk! Our tea's getting cold. Let's do something fun this afternoon. What do you say? I'll organize.
Paimon: Actually... We... kind of already have plans this afternoon.
Paimon: We told Xianyun that we would go to her kite-making workshop...
Gaming: Oh?
Paimon: Are you interested in kite-making, Gaming?
Gaming: Oh, no. It's just that I happen to know Aunty Xianyun.
Traveler: Aunty Xianyun...
Traveler: Aunty is no way to address a mighty and illuminated Adeptus.
Paimon: That title certainly humanizes her a bit...
Paimon: Uh, do you not know who she really is, Gaming?
Gaming: Oh, I know that she's an adeptus. I met her during a delivery once. But hasn't she been in the city lately? She's even tried... with some limited success, to change her terms of self-address, or something like that...
Gaming: She came to see me a few days ago to ask about luminescent dyes. Wait a second... She doesn't plan on putting those on a kite, does she?
Paimon: Is that not something you can do?
Gaming: It's one thing to use it on cloth. But applying it to paper is another matter entirely. Why couldn't she tell me what she wanted them for...
Paimon: Yeah, she does seem to have trouble with that sometimes.
Gaming: It would be such a shame if everyone worked so hard on their kites only for them to get ruined in the end. Okay, I'll go with you. If Aunty Xianyun wants to use those dyes on a kite, the formula will need to be changed.
Paimon: Great! The more the merrier!

## Talk 2

Yaoyao: Ganyu, Ganyu! C'mon, wake up! Some friends have arrived!
Ganyu: Hello... friends...
Yaoyao: Ganyuuu!
Shenhe: I have some mint oil. Perhaps we should try that?
Shenhe: A guest at Wanmin Restaurant recommended it to me. I've tried it. Its stimulative effects are much stronger than what can be achieved from chewing on mint leaves alone.
Ganyu: *snore* *snore*
Shenhe: *sigh*
Shenhe: ...Apologies in advance.
Yaoyao: Wait! Shenhe! Not there...!
Black Screen Text: You see Shenhe take out a small green bottle, extract some minty-smelling liquid, and apply it to Ganyu's horns.
Ganyu: ...Ahem, ahem! ...Aaah!
Shenhe: See, it worked. She's awake.
Yaoyao: Are you okay, Ganyu? Do you need some water? Or maybe something to eat?
Ganyu: I—I'm fine. I just feel... chilly all over... *shiver*....
Shenhe: Huh. Was it that effective?
Yaoyao: Chilly, huh... Hmm... Master always says, "a cool head leads to a calm heart." So, does this mean that heat's what we need to help you, Ganyu?
Paimon: Paimon doesn't think that's what the expression means, exactly...
Ganyu: Phew... I—I feel a bit better now...
Ganyu: Was I asleep? Must have been around the time I usually take my midday nap...
Shenhe: Did you not sleep last night? That does seem to happen to you often.
Shenhe: Perhaps you should come work at Wanmin Restaurant with me. We get off at ten on the dot every night without fail.
Ganyu: I—I could never!
Ganyu: I'm sorry, I seem to have missed your name. You are...?
Gaming: Me? My name is Gaming. I work as a guard for the Secure Transport Agency.
Ganyu: Gaming... The name sounds familiar. I believe I've heard your name mentioned around the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Ganyu: People tell me you're an extremely enthusiastic worker and are very generous with your help.
Gaming: Eh, well you know me. Or, I guess you don't, haha...
Ganyu: My name is Ganyu. This is Shenhe, and this is Yaoyao.
Gaming: It's an honor to finally meet you all!
Gaming: Oh, you must be here for Aunty Xianyun's kite-making workshop, right?
Shenhe: Yes.
Shenhe: I have neither made nor flown a kite before. As long as Master is willing to teach, I am willing to learn.
Yaoyao: Me too! I want to participate in the kite-flying competition with my best friend.
Yaoyao: Plus, it's more meaningful if you make the kite yourself, right?
Paimon: Your best friend didn't come with you?
Yaoyao: Well, Qiqi's been super busy helping Dr. Baizhu lately... I'll meet up with her later and give her a huge surprise!
Yaoyao: Oh! I also brought bandages and ointment with me today. It's easy to cut yourself when working with bamboo, so I thought I should come prepared.
Gaming: Wow, you're really thoughtful!
Ganyu: As for myself... I'm afraid I lack some of my companions' enthusiasm.
Ganyu: I was originally planning to buy a ready-made kite and just enjoy the festive city atmosphere with everyone...
Ganyu: But Cloud Retainer is always going out of her way to look after her juniors, wanting us to have the best there is — she always puts us before herself.
Gaming: ...
Ganyu: It was so thoughtful of her to arrange this workshop, so I simply couldn't let such consideration go to waste.
Ganyu: My motivation for being here might be a little different, yes, but I'm ready to put in just as much effort as everyone else!
Paimon: Well, we're all here. But where the heck is Xianyun? Shouldn't she be here by now?
Xianyun: Who is it that speaks of oneself in such an ill-tempered tone?
Paimon: C'mon, you clearly heard Paimon!
Shuyu: Master stopped to buy Grilled Tiger Fish to share with everyone — come get it while it's still warm.
Paimon: Paimon's sorry, Miss Illuminated Bird. Paimon always knew you were the smartest, coolest, and prettiest adeptus. Someone as wonderful as you is sure to have brought enough for Paimon as well... right?
Xianyun: Hmph...
Black Screen Text: Cloud Retainer sets down her bags while Shuyu hands out the grilled fish. As everyone begins to talk, lively conversation fills the usually tranquil environment of Mt. Aocang...
Paimon: Ah, so delicious! Paimon's life is complete...
Xianyun: Hmm... It appears that we've ended up with quite a few participants indeed. Go ahead and divide yourselves into small groups.
Xianyun: The materials are over here. The regular dyes and luminescent ones have been clearly marked. Use them as you see fit.
Xianyun: As for how to make the kite, one assumes you all made sure to listen to the instructions one provided while we were eating, yes? Are there any questions?
Paimon: Paimon may have focused a little too hard on the eating and less on the listening...
Traveler: I'll be the one making it anyway.
Traveler: You can just help out.
Paimon: #Paimon knew she could count on you, Traveler!
Xianyun: One will wait under this tree and avail oneself of the cool air while one digests. Do not hesitate to seek one's company if you have any trouble, questions, or simply want to chat.
Paimon: We're not in any hurry to get started. Why don't we go see what the others are up to?

## Talk 3

Ganyu: ...

## Talk 4

Shuyu: Hey Gaming, want to team up?
Gaming: Huh? I have to participate? I thought I'd be done for the day after adjusting the dye formula.
Paimon: You're that unenthused by kite-making, huh? That doesn't seem like you.
Gaming: No, it's not that. It's just...
Gaming: *sigh* It would take too long to explain. I guess I'll just make one then.
Gaming: What shape should we go with... How about a butterfly?
Traveler: (The butterfly symbolizes the desire for freedom. Perhaps that's also what Gaming's searching for.)
Gaming: What do you think, Shuyu? Is there a particular design you want?
Shuyu: I want a suanni!
Gaming: That might be a little hard to pull off...
Shuyu: True, but I still want to try! They're super cute!
Gaming: Okay! It's decided, then!

## Talk 5

Shuyu: Gaming, can I do the coloring?
Gaming: Sure! I'll go ahead and make the frame for you.

## Talk 6

Ganyu: Um, Shenhe... It would be great if you could refrain from putting things on my horns from now on. They're really quite sensitive...
Shenhe: I see. My apologies. I shall remember that in the future.
Ganyu: Thank you. No harm done.
Shenhe: Good.
Shenhe: ...Could I touch them just once more though? No oil or anything this time. I've just always wondered what Ms. Ganyu's horns feel like.
Ganyu: Huh? Please, I told you, just call me "Ganyu"... *sigh* Well, alright... Just be gentle.
Shenhe: (Firm to the touch with no discernable temperature, not unlike certain medicinal plants I've eaten before.)
Shenhe: (Still, Ganyu appears to be shaking like a cat whose whiskers have just been touched... I should stop.)
Ganyu: Ugh...
Shenhe: ...I see.
Shenhe: Then I'll apply the oil to your forehead next time.
Ganyu: Oh, no need, I'll just... refrain from taking afternoon naps outdoors.
Ganyu: *cough* *cough*... Anyway, we should probably get started on our kite. It won't be long before Cloud Retainer comes to check on our progress.
Ganyu: Perhaps... Perhaps we should just choose the most traditional style.
Shenhe: Okay.
Paimon: Well, they seem to be getting along swimmingly. Let's not disturb them.

## Talk 7

Ganyu: The scissor-tailed swallow sure takes a lot of curved bamboo rods to build...
Shenhe: Ah...
Shenhe: It broke.

## Talk 8

Yaoyao: Aunty Cloud Retainer, look! Am I doing it right?
Xianyun: Very good. Your frame is nice and sturdy. This design... Is it a finch?
Yaoyao: Yep! ♪ *whistle*~ ♪
Xianyun: Hehe... One is looking forward to seeing your finished product.
Paimon: What color are you going to make it, Yaoyao?
Yaoyao: I haven't decided yet. If I make it blue, it'll be more like my friend. But if I make it gold, it'll be more like me.
Xianyun: If you are asking for one's own opinion... One would advise choosing gold.
Xianyun: When giving a gift, the key consideration is the recipient's feelings, is it not? One imagines your friend would much prefer a kite that reminds them of you.
Yaoyao: Hey, I never told you the kite was for Qiqi... How did you know?
Xianyun: With age comes wisdom, child. One simply has a way of knowing things.
Yaoyao: Cool! Thanks, Aunty Cloud Retainer!
Yaoyao: I'm gonna start painting it gold right now!
Xianyun: Good. One will watch.
Xianyun: You two seem strangely unoccupied. One was under the impression that one was supposed to be doing the relaxing. Is your kite finished?
Paimon: W—We actually haven't started yet. But we're going to start... right now!

## Talk 9

Yaoyao: Once I get better at making kites, I'm going to make one shaped like Yuegui.
Yaoyao: You gave him to me, and he's just the best!
Xianyun: Hehe... One is pleased that you like the gift.

## Talk 10

Paimon: First, we have to decide on the shape... Hey, what are you laughing at?
Traveler: The obvious answer is to make a Paimon-shaped kite.
Paimon: Hmm, that's not a completely crazy idea.
Paimon: If nothing else, a Paimon-shaped kite could at least make sure you never get lost on your travels and always find the tastiest food and funnest things to do wherever you go!
Paimon: Maybe we're not exercising enough artistic license... We should exaggerate this a bit. How about this? The word "Paimon" means... "The Guardian Angel of Travelers"!
Black Screen Text: You build the kite's frame according to Cloud Retainer's instructions...
Paimon: Now... what expression should we give her? Since the kite is going to be flying super high in the sky...

## Talk 11

Traveler: She should look pleased with herself...
Paimon: Ooh, like this? "Hahahaha! The title of champion kite-flyer is mine!"

## Talk 12

Houzhang: Hmm. This Fontainian device of mechanical motion is quite curious indeed...
Jiehu: Now is hardly an opportune time for your musings! Someone among us was not sufficiently attentive, and now the kite has vanished!
Houzhang: Calm yourself. Do you have any recollection of its last location?
Jiehu: One believes it drifted in the direction of Mt. Aocang.
Jiehu: Perhaps it is mere happenstance, but one feels a certain sense of dread at the thought.
Houzhang: Your concern is misplaced, surely.
Houzhang: Cloud Retainer is either in the city looking after her disciples or secluded in her abode attending to her research. She will not notice that kite.
Houzhang: On the subject of said kite, however, one simply must remark on the genius of its windless lift technology. One cannot help but surmise that its ingenuity rivals that of Cloud Retainer's creations...
Jiehu: Still thy tongue! If Cloud Retainer were to hear you profess such a thing, we can both say farewell to any further use of the Supreme Cuisine Machine!
Xianyun: One presumes... that this kite belongs to you?
Houzhang: ...!
Jiehu: (Regard the situation with which we are now confronted! This is all your fault!)
Houzhang: (One's fault? One seems to recall that releasing the kite was no solitary endeavor.)
Houzhang: (Say something, Mountain Shaper. Surely you can think of something to appease her!)
Jiehu: (Further explanation shall only fan the flames of her wrath. It would be better to stay silent and retire at the earliest opportunity!)
Houzhang: (We can hardly avoid her forever. That may suffice during Lantern Rite, but what about the Moonchase Festival? Sooner or later, she will discover our true identity.)
Xianyun: ...Hello?
Jiehu: (Go retrieve the kite.)
Houzhang: (Absolutely not. You retrieve it!)
Jiehu: That... is not our kite...
Xianyun: Oh? So, an adeptus such as oneself is mistaken then?
Houzhang: Ah! You're an adeptus? Please forgive us for any impropriety.
Houzhang: I truly possess no inkling of who could have released a kite into your esteemed demesne. Pray, who could be responsible for such wanton behavior...
Jiehu: Verily! Verily! We were but delighting in the surrounding scenery. This locale is home to such exquisite...erm... Ah! Mint!
Jiehu: Well, and if that's all, then we'll just be on our way...
Paimon: Phew... we finally caught up. You sure do fly fast in your illuminated bird form, Xianyun!
Paimon: Moon Carver? Mountain Shaper? What are you doing here?
Houzhang (Houzhang & Jiehu): ...You!
...I!
Jiehu: ...I!
Traveler: She...
Paimon: Okay, now Paimon's getting a weird vibe. Did she say something wrong?
Xianyun: It is of no consequence. Long has one seen through their disguises. One was simply curious as to how long they would keep up the act.
Houzhang: Then, you are not angry?
Xianyun: Hmph. How could one feel anger at the sight of two old friends enjoying themselves? One is also well aware of how enticing these city novelties can be.
Jiehu: *sigh* We were simply consumed by a fit of festive spirit. Seldom do we get the opportunity to partake in the delights of the times.
Jiehu: However, we are far from being as adept as you in matters that require a deftness of hand. No worthy kite could be born of our own making. Thus, we could only take the convenient route, so to speak.
Houzhang: Your prowess in mechanics is unparalleled, Cloud Retainer. You wield the wind and waves themselves. Your singular talent stands unmatched across the land... Of this we are well aware.
Xianyun: Hmph...
Xianyun: One has guests to attend to. We will have to convene again some other time.
Xianyun: #Traveler, Paimon, do try to keep up.
Paimon: We're leaving already? Argh, all this flying from place to place is wearing Paimon out!

## Talk 13

Shenhe: They're back.
Paimon: Paimon's pooped. Huh? Why are there only two of you left?
Ganyu: After you left, Yaoyao and Shuyu tired themselves out playing with their kites.
Ganyu: Gaming offered to escort them home.
Shenhe: Before he left, he said something that I don't quite understand.
Paimon: Oh? What did he say?
Shenhe: He said, "A kite is always tied down no matter how far it flies or how high it soars. Its tether prevents it from ever truly flying free."
Shenhe: He looked quite dejected as he said this.
Ganyu: Now that you mention it, Gaming did seem to have a rather strange attitude towards kites.
Traveler: Perhaps he sees himself reflected in them?
Shenhe: A reflection of himself...
Shenhe: If I were a kite, I would cherish that tether as a symbol of kinship and the bonds that tie us, and...
Paimon: Shenhe?
Shenhe: It may be an exceedingly slim and distant connection, but lose it, and you lose that which links you to home.
Shenhe: If Gaming truly sees a kite as a reflection of himself... Then I fear I understand his words even less.
Ganyu: Well, people often have different points of view depending on their mindset and experiences, right? It's actually quite normal.
Shenhe: ...Just like some people can eat spicy food, but others won't go anywhere near it?
Ganyu: Exactly. That's why tolerance and understanding are as important as they are.
Xianyun: Tolerance and understanding? What brought about this conversation? Did one miss something?
Paimon: We were just chatting — you don't have to butt in on every little thing, you know. Where were you, anyway?
Xianyun: Hmph, one was merely doing a bit of cooking.
Xianyun: Night fast approaches. If you are otherwise unoccupied, one would entreat you to stay and eat before you depart.
Ganyu: Oh! It's been so long since I've had the chance to enjoy your cooking, Cloud Retainer!
Shenhe: ...Uh.
Xianyun: Worry not. One has prepared a variety of meat and vegetable dishes. One is more than familiar with everyone's culinary proclivities.
Traveler: We'll take you up on your offer then.
Xianyun: Shenhe, Ganyu, come with me.
Paimon: Woah, what's with all the secrecy? You're not trying to play favorites, are you?
Paimon: If you're ready to serve the food, we can help too!
Traveler: I call dibs on Paimon's portion.
Paimon: Hey! Paimon's hungry too! It's not like the dim sum and grilled fish could keep her full the whole day, y'know!

## Talk 14

Traveler: She should look afraid...
Paimon: "It's too high! Someone save Paimon! She's about to faint!" Like that?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: She should look guilty about something...
Paimon: "Ohh, Paimon totally didn't do anything wrong, and even if she did, she doesn't deserve to get shot up into the sky for it..." Something like this, then?

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: Let me rethink this...
Paimon: Since the kite is going to be flying super high in the sky...

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: Yep, that's the one.
Paimon: Now that we've decided, let's make it happen.

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: Yep, that's the one.
Paimon: Now that we've decided, let's make it happen.

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: Yep, that's the one.
Paimon: Now that we've decided, let's make it happen.

### Additional Talk 6

Paimon: Phew... it's done! Paimon has to say, Kite-Paimon might even rival real Paimon in terms of cuteness.
Paimon: Now we just have to attach the string, right?
Xianyun: Alright. Gather around, everyone.
Paimon: Oh! Xianyun's calling us.
Xianyun: Let one take a look...
Yaoyao: Wow! Ganyu and Shenhe made a scissor-tailed swallow! It's so pretty!
Shuyu: Yep! The coloring... makes it look a lot like Master.
Paimon: If the tail wasn't split in two like that, it might even be a spitting image!
Paimon: If you look closely, there are a few spots where the colors go outside the lines... Did you doze off while painting it, Ganyu?
Shenhe: I did the painting.
Shenhe: I stared at the paper for quite some time, but I simply could not recall the coloring of any bird... except Master.
Shenhe: Or should I say that I'm too familiar with her crane form? Even when she stands before us in human form, all I can see is blue and white.
Paimon: Oh... Well, now that you mention it, Paimon can see it too...
Shenhe: Exactly. So, I simply closed my eyes and painted from memory.
Gaming: No way! You can paint with your eyes closed? Wow, the disciples of adepti really are something!
Xianyun: You are most filial, Shenhe. One is flattered by the likeness.
Ganyu: The suanni that Gaming and Shuyu made looks very majestic. I'm sure it'll look even more impressive as it soars through the sky.
Shuyu: The eyes and ears glow in the dark, so you're sure to see it at night.
Shuyu: Your golden finch is cute too, Yaoyao!
Yaoyao: It's all thanks to Aunty Cloud Retainer's guidance.
Shenhe: #What about your kite, Traveler?
Paimon: Tada! Here it is!
Xianyun: Its self-important countenance bears a striking resemblance to that of its namesake.
Yaoyao: Hehe, it makes her look like she's already won the competition.
Paimon: Well, that's gonna happen one way or another.
Xianyun: Hmph...

### Additional Talk 7

Paimon: Phew... it's done! Paimon has to say, Kite-Paimon might even rival real Paimon in terms of cuteness.

Shenhe: #What about your kite, Traveler?
Paimon: Tada! Here it is!
Gaming: Pfft, that's hilarious.
Paimon: Why does Paimon feel like you're laughing at her and not with her...
Gaming: I'm just admiring the expression you chose. Whether the kite soars high in the air or comes crashing straight to the ground, it's still fitting.
Gaming: #Traveler, that's quite the impressive feat, actually.

Shenhe: Very Paimon-like indeed.
Paimon: Why do you say that, Shenhe?
Shenhe: #That one time Traveler suspected that a piece of meat was missing from their bowl, that was the exact expression on your face.
Paimon: I—Is that something that happened?
Traveler: ...So it was you.

### Additional Talk 9

### Additional Talk 14

Black Screen Text: You wait outside Cloud Retainer's abode for a few moments...
Paimon: Th—This is...!
Ganyu: (Ohh... I can feel the wind brushing against my legs. This is a bit embarrassing...)
Ganyu: (Is the headpiece secure? I should have asked Cloud Retainer to check before I stepped outside...)
Shenhe: How do we look?
Ganyu: (Huh!? She asked them just like that...?)
Traveler: You look great.
Paimon: You look pretty too, Ganyu. How should Paimon put it? You both look so elegant and refined — those outfits really suit you both.
Xianyun: Given that one employed the services of the best tailor in all of Liyue, one would expect nothing less.
Xianyun: What colors have you been partial to lately, Shenhe and Ganyu?
Ganyu: (Lately? Why is Cloud Retainer suddenly asking about what colors we like?)
Shenhe: I like black.
Xianyun: One is gratified to see that one's disciple has inherited one's own tastes.
Shenhe: (The color black doesn't get dirty easily — a virtue I've come to value recently.)
Xianyun: And you, Ganyu?
Ganyu: I favor blue and black.
Xianyun: And the material is sufficiently comfortable, yes?
Ganyu: Yes, very. I simply cannot thank you enough, Cloud Retainer — for this gift, and the kite, too.
Shenhe: Thank you, Master.
Xianyun: One is content as long as you are pleased with the gift. One hopes these garments will see much use.
Black Screen Text: You sit down and enjoy a tableful of delicious food and pleasant company...
Paimon: Seems like your Supreme Cuisine Machine is just getting better and better, Xianyun!
Paimon: This Golden Crab's particularly good. The shell's deliciously crunchy, and the meat inside is so succulent and sweet. Hehe, Paimon can't stop eating!
Paimon: It's a good thing Gaming isn't here or Paimon would have to have to duel him for the food — y'know, with chopsticks!
Traveler: It would be a close match.
Xianyun: He traveled all this way on account of the kite-making workshop, and he spent the whole afternoon looking after Shuyu... One was hoping to treat him to a meal.
Xianyun: Oh well... One will just have to extend one's thanks in person.
Ganyu: It's rare for someone to make such a good impression on you, Cloud Retainer.
Xianyun: Hah. One has high standards.
Xianyun: He appears to be a young man of much merit, and one is not the type who would see such potential squandered.
Shenhe: It appears that he wishes to break free from the kite string that tethers him.
Xianyun: Kite string? What strange metaphors you speak in, Shenhe. Ever since you returned from Wanmin Restaurant, your turns of phrase render one at quite the loss.
Paimon: Where do we even begin... Oh, do you know about the conflict between Gaming and his dad, Xianyun?
Xianyun: One has only heard that the two are not on good terms...
Paimon: He ran away from home and hasn't been back since!
Shenhe: Oh?
Xianyun: Ran away, you say? One believes we would all benefit from a more thorough retelling. Start from the beginning.
Paimon: Oh, okay. Paimon just hopes he won't mind...
Black Screen Text: Paimon tells Cloud Retainer everything she knows about Gaming's family situation...
Shenhe: ...What?
Xianyun: This shall not do!
Xianyun: Lantern Rite fast approaches. We must make haste.
Xianyun: As one was contacting various tailors around Liyue, one could not help but be reminded of Menogias.
Xianyun: He possessed a singular talent for clothing design. He had an exquisite eye not just for fabric selection and color pairing, but also for what accessories could best accentuate a garment's overall styling.
Xianyun: At a gathering of adepti, Bonanus once complained in secret to some of the ladies in attendance that the skirt Menogias made for her was too long and impractical, lamenting that it would only hinder her in battle.
Xianyun: However, when one asked Menogias his opinion, he remarked that the train of the skirt would serve to enhance her adeptal countenance by exemplifying a certain elegance. Menogias was that type of person. When it came to topics relating to garments and accessories, not even Rex Lapis could best his stubbornness.
Xianyun: And later...
Traveler: ...
Xianyun: Ah, one seems to have strayed off-topic.
Xianyun: One means to say that Lantern Rite should be a day of reunion.
Xianyun: It is a time to address problems before they turn into regrets.
Xianyun: Fate is fickle. The cruel reality of this world is that suffering and misfortune can befall any of us without design or reason. If there is a chance for young people to remain insulated from this reality, one should do one's utmost to make it so.
Paimon: That's nice and all, but...
Ganyu: Do you have any ideas, Cloud Retainer?
Xianyun: Perhaps adeptal arts could be of use? No, no... mechanics, perhaps? Hmm, one fails to see its use in a situation such as this...
Shenhe: ...Is there anything I can do to help?
Xianyun: Hmm...
Xianyun: Combining our efforts... is a fine idea indeed.
Xianyun: Aha! One has an idea...
Xianyun: How about this...
Xianyun: ...Does that make sense to everyone?
Paimon: Yep! Paimon really hopes this works!
Xianyun: Hmph, one's designs never fail.
Xianyun: Now then, I counsel rest for all, and to make the necessary preparations. One shall see you in two days...
Traveler: You'd trounce him.

### Additional Talk 15

Jiehu: *exhale*... It seems that one's concern was misplaced after all.
Houzhang: Then should we continue flying the kite?
Jiehu: A splendid suggestion! But it would be advisable to change locations.
Houzhang: Perhaps your mountain would suffice? It is more than spacious enough.
Jiehu: A fine idea... a fine idea indeed.

### Additional Talk 16

Ganyu: Is that... the Jade Chamber?
Xianyun: Oh?
Black Screen Text: As a gentle breeze brushes past, the "Jade Chamber" drifts towards everyone's feet...
Xianyun: Who dares attempt such a flagrant display of impropriety by releasing a kite into one's territory without one's permission...
Xianyun: And to do so by making use of this... crude piece of mortal machinery!
Xianyun: One simply must know who it is that possesses such impertinence!
Xianyun: Continue attaching the strings, everyone. One will be but a moment.
Ganyu: Cloud Retainer...!
Ganyu: #Traveler, Paimon, could I trouble you to go after Cloud Retainer?
Shuyu: Master is going to be okay, right?
Ganyu: I'm... more worried about the person who released the kite.
