# Owe Mora, Pay Mora


## Talk 1

Goth: *sigh* I suppose I might have to sort this out myself...
Goth: Ack, these old bones will fall apart at this rate...
Traveler: Is there some urgent matter?
Goth: Oh, Traveler? Well, this... I wouldn't call it "an urgent matter," but it is getting out of hand for sure...
Goth: As you know, those Fatui have my hotel fully booked.
Goth: And as you know, I, as the boss of the Goth Grand Hotel, have to attend to them.
Goth: I coordinate food catering, repairs, and a slew of miscellaneous matters besides.
Goth: Lately, some rooms have had their furniture damaged, so I've had to contact people to bring the appropriate timber to some carpenters.
Goth: Then there's the matter of collecting rent on a few apartments... and the matter of my lad Marvin being nowhere to be found.
Goth: *sigh* I wonder how long I can last... Or when that boy will finally grow up...
Traveler: I'll lend you a hand.
Goth: You're willing to help? Ah, that's wonderful! ... *sigh* If only that loud Marvin had as good a head on his shoulders as you. That would've spared me much trouble...
Goth: In that case, could I trouble you to fetch some Fir Wood and Birch Wood? I'll need to have them sent to the carpenters soon.
Traveler: You rest here first.

## Talk 2

Goth: Have you obtained the timber? I just need one set of Fir Wood and another of Birch Wood.

## Talk 3

Goth: Thank you so much. These should do. Now to send them off to the carpenter... Oh. Right! I need to collect rent as well...
Goth: *sigh* I just wonder if that... As... Astromona, or whatever she was called, will be in this time...
Traveler: It's Mona Megistus, the Astrologist.
Goth: Right! Yes, that was her name... Ugh. It's a bit long, if you ask me.
Paimon: Mona hasn't paid her rent, you say?
Goth: Well, that's just the thing, see? All my other tenants have already paid theirs. She's the only one left.
Goth: I came by a few times previously, but she wasn't in.
Goth: So please, Traveler, help me go down there and urge her to pay up soon, would you?

## Talk 4

Mona: Ah, it's you. It's been a while.
Mona: Strange, you seem to be in a hurry. Were you looking for me, by any chance?
Paimon: Where have you been, Mona?
Traveler: We've been looking for you these last few days.
Mona: Oh, that was... rather inopportune of you. A few days ago, The Steambird sent me a request for a new manuscript.
Mona: The topic in question was "celestial shifts and their relation to a person's changing fates."
Mona: As such, I have largely been out studying the stars these past couple of days, only returning well after dark.
Paimon: Looks like Mona's working for that Mora...
Mona: Wâ€”Well, I mean, there's this new celestial globe from Fontaine that I've put down an order for. I've even paid the deposit already.
Mona: Once I get the Mora from submitting this manuscript, I should be able to settle the balance and claim the celestial globe.
Traveler: Well, don't forget about your rent payment to Goth...
Mona: Rent?
Mona: Oh! I, um... Surely, I've put some Mora aside for this...
Mona: Give me a moment...
Black Screen Text: Mona rifles through her purse...
Mona: These here... and these! There, that should cover it!
Traveler: (She's practically emptied her pockets here...)
Mona: Right, then. Help me pass this Mora to Goth, would you?

## Talk 5

Goth: How did it go? Were you able to find that Ast... Well, your friend?
Traveler: Here's the rent.
Goth: Ah, good, good. This will do. Thank you very much.
Goth: That said, might I ask what it is that your friend does for a living?
Goth: She seems like the capable sort, and yet she always appears short on Mora...

## Talk 6

Mona: You're back. I assume Goth has been paid?
Traveler: That he has.
Mona: That's good. Thankfully, the rent on this house isn't particularly expensive. I was just barely able to scrounge up the necessary Mora as things stood.
Mona: That said, I suppose I'll be subsisting on salad for a few more days...
