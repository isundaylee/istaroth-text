Traveler: What is the theory behind that product?
Vahid: Um, well... It must be the elemental power within, which grants the land more vitality, and then that, uh...
Vahid: *cough* I'm not a researcher, so I can't really explain it well. Anyway, we the Sumeru locals all use this stuff for farming. Its effects are impeccable.
Vahid: It's perfect either for your own use or as a gift for your family and friends!

Traveler: How's business going?
Vahid: Why would you ask that? Of course...
Vahid: ...Ah, never mind. I'll be honest with you.
Vahid: Before the Sakoku Decree, we still had Inazuma locals coming from Narukami Island to purchase our goods.
Vahid: But ever since the Sakoku Decree took effect, only a few people have come. It's getting harder to do business, and I'm not sure how long we can last...
Vahid: Dear customer, would you like some Anahitian Blessing? How about buying it as a souvenir for your journey here?

Traveler: How's business been?
Vahid: Uh... How should I put this?
Vahid: I originally thought that the Sakoku Decree's abolishing would see business pick up, but it hasn't actually improved all that much.
Vahid: It's always the same few customers coming to purchase fertilizers. They often forget the method of using the fertilizer to boot...
Vahid: Well, by the way, dear customer, would you like some Anahitian Blessing? How about buying it as a souvenir for your journey here?
