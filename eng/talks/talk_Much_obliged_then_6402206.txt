Traveler: Much obliged, then.
Kamal: Sumeru City was built on the Divine Tree, with the upper levels being meant for the Akademiya and the lower levels for the common folks. Move up if you seek further education or get a promotion, but if you want to take life steady, the Grand Bazaar is the choice for you.
Kamal: Researchers led by Dendro Archon cultivated a large rainforest right next to Sumeru City, which has helped Sumeru survive difficult times in the past.
Kamal: But it's not a good idea to delve too deep into the rainforest. An encounter with beasts and The Withering within can prove deadly, so be sure to call a Forest Ranger for help in case of any danger.
Kamal: There are plenty of places to stay near the rainforest, such as Gandharva Ville, where the Forest Rangers and Vanara gather, and the tranquil Vimara Village.
Kamal: Further south is Port Ormos, the largest import and export port in Sumeru. Most people who travel to Sumeru by water enter that way.
