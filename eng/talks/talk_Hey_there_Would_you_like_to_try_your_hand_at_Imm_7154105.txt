Yaolu: Hey there! Would you like to try your hand at "Immortal Combat"?
Traveler: Let's do it!
Traveler: What's "Immortal Combat"?
Yaolu: Simply put, this is a game where rattan figures will engage in combat under our command. This is a game with quite the long history on our end.
Yaolu: In the past, we would fashion our own little rattan figures, control them, and pit them in combat against one another.
Yaolu: Some veteran players could even have them perform real swordplay.
Yaolu: But later... Well, everyone found more fun things to play with, so this game fell to the wayside, with the rattan figures becoming purely commemorative items.
Yaolu: But when I was little, I loved these little rattan figures. I would pester my family members to play with me, or help me make more figures.
Yaolu: The ones my grandma made? Those were fantastic — she taught me everything I know about making them.
Yaolu: Grandpa was skilled in crafts, and he'd use wood to carve all sorts of awesome weapons, arming my rattan figures to the teeth with them.
Yaolu: My parents, too, would always find time to play with me no matter how busy they were...
Yaolu: And who knows? Perhaps the rattan figures I'd always put on my desk came to the Ministry of Civil Affairs's notice eventually...
Yaolu: And that might be why they opened up a booth related to the figures... which is, of course, "Immortal Combat."
Yaolu: You can be sure that I volunteered myself to take charge of it the moment I heard the news — and they agreed.
Yaolu: So, would you like to give it a try? Trust me, it's great fun! Not to mention how each of them was fashioned by Lan Yan herself, and she's a real pro!
Traveler: I don't have time at the moment...
Yaolu: Don't worry. Just go ahead and take care of whatever you need to, and come down to the booth whenever you feel like playing.
