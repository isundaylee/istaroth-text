# Ascension Challenge II


## Talk 1

Traveler: I'm here for the Ascension Challenge!
Prince: Meow... (Hmm? Here for the Ascension Challenge? I see... You are indeed qualified for the challenge. Alright...)
Prince: "I'll have Shuyun set up the challenge for you immediately. Do be careful!"

## Talk 2

Prince: Meow! (How wonderful! Congratulations on completing the Ascension Challenge. You're now an Expert player!)
Prince: (You are now qualified to challenge more players. By the way, although you could already do it before, let me remind you that you are allowed to post on the invitation board...)
Prince: Meow... (This way, whoever wants to challenge you can throw down the gauntlet. A duel without knowing a thing about your opponent can be quite interesting sometimes, don't you think?)
Prince: (After all, meeting up for a duel is also an opportunity to hang out.)
Prince: #Meow! (Ah! Sorry, I digress. Anyway, as an Expert player, you, dear Traveler, have now gained the privilege to buy some truly amazing-looking cards...)
Prince: #(Traveler, don't forget why you started playing in the first place, and may the fun be with you in the world of Genius Invokation TCG!)

## Talk 3

Prince: Meow... (How unfortunate... Try to be extra careful next time and perhaps make some adjustments to your deck before your next attempt.)
Prince: (I believe you are capable of completing this challenge.)
