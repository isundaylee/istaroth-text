# Ever So Close


## Talk 1

Paimon: Our dealings with Dori went smoothly enough. Let's head to Wikala Funduq and meet up with Alhaitham.
Paimon: Hopefully now, he'll finally tell us about what the Akademiya lost.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Let's see Dori today and ask her about where the Divine Knowledge Capsule is.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Well, we figured out where the Divine Knowledge Capsule is! It turns out it ended up in the hands of Ayn Al-Ahmar.
Paimon: Let's head back and talk to Alhaitham!

## Talk 4

Alhaitham: Now, I'll start recording data again.
Paimon: Alhaitham, how's it going?
Alhaitham: #Well, the Knowledge Capsule you purchased did improve his combat capability. During the second fight, his overall fighting performance increased by 0.073%.
Paimon: Wait... how much?
Traveler: 0.073%.
Paimon: Aaarrrgh! Dori's such a jerk! She totally scammed us! One million Mora? This thing isn't worth a tenth of that amount!
Alhaitham: #Of course, this could be because he is so powerful that the capsule's contents were unable to produce a substantial increase.
Alhaitham: At the very least, this test allowed me to gain more insight into you two. Our deal seems increasingly worth my investment.
Alhaitham: I'm heading back to the Wikala Funduq. I await your response in two days' time. This is Mora for when you ask Dori for information. Pay her as much as she requests.
Traveler: That's basically zero.

## Talk 5

Dori: Here, over here! Welcome back, my loyal patrons. What can I do for you this time?
Dori: You name it! Canned Knowledge, supplies, or anything else you need, I'll find a way to get it... Where there's a waterfall of Mora, there's a way.
Paimon: Can you really get us anything we want? Anything at all?
Dori: Aha! So it appears that Canned Knowledge alone is no longer sufficient for your opulent appetite? Then please, oblige me, tell me what you have in mind!
Traveler: I'd like to buy info on the whereabouts of the Divine Knowledge Capsule.
Dori: Oh, hehehe! I knew customers with pockets as deep as yours would undoubtedly crave something more profound than ordinary Canned Knowledge.
Dori: But you know, that kind of information isn't going to be cheap.
Dori: After all, I had to work really hard to weasel my way into the auction site. Not to mention that if anyone found out that I was the leaker, I would be in big, big trouble.
Paimon: But how can we be sure your information is accurate? Paimon's curious how you just happen to have this kind of info the moment we need it.
Dori: Hehehe... Because to me, anything of value is what I consider to be my supply. Therefore, I must always be aware of what's hot on the market in order to secure more sales.
Dori: As for the information's authenticity, well, you've no need to worry about that. I used a Kamera to take a picture of the transaction. That way, no one can dispute it.
Traveler: Name your price.
Dori: It's always a pleasure doing business with such sterling patrons.
Dori: Ahem, now that you've paid in full, here's the scoop: The Divine Knowledge Capsule was purchased yesterday by a certain Mizri, the leader of Ayn Al-Ahmar.
Paimon: Ayn Al-Ahmar? You mean the Eremites who worship King Deshret?
Dori: Ah, so you're already familiar with them.
Dori: The group has done everything in their power to obtain the Divine Knowledge Capsule. After all, they believe it contains the power of King Deshret.
Dori: That Divine Knowledge Capsule is unlike any other Canned Knowledge I've seen before. It was glowing bright red.
Dori: The capsule is clearly visible in the picture I took. You can look for yourself.
Paimon: Thanks for the info, Dori.
Dori: Please, it's my pleasure. It's all thanks to discerning customers such as yourselves that my efforts yesterday were not in vain. Please, don't hesitate to contact me if you ever need anything else in the future — Mora for Dori opens doors!
Traveler: I'll buy the information.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Alhaitham! We got the info you wanted!
Alhaitham: Really? Alright, let's hear it.
Traveler: It's in the hands of Ayn Al-Ahmar.
Paimon: Dori even gave us evidence to verify the intel. Have a look!
Alhaitham: Huh, look at that... clear as day. It must have taken some guts just to infiltrate the scene of the Eremites' transaction. But then to get close enough to take a picture like this... Bold move, Dori. Very bold move.
Alhaitham: Alright, the person in this picture is indeed Mizri, the leader of Ayn Al-Ahmar, and the glowing red capsule he's holding appears to be the Divine Knowledge Capsule.
Alhaitham: In which case, if we play our cards right, when we confront them next week, we should be able to force them to show their hand.
Paimon: At first, Paimon didn't get why you were provoking these Ayn Al-Ahmar guys, but now it sorta makes sense. Everything's playing right into your hands.
Paimon: After we defeat them, we can finally have a serious talk with their boss and get him to lend us the Divine Knowledge Capsule!
Alhaitham: Thank you for your time and efforts. Take a few days off while I make some preparations. Let's meet up again on the afternoon of the arranged date, three o'clock sharp.
Traveler: We'll be there.
Alhaitham: See you then.
Black Screen Text: A few days later, on the day of the meeting with Ayn Al-Ahmar...
Paimon: Alhaitham sure is taking his time. Where could he be? Oh, there he is!
Alhaitham: Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's head to the pier in front of Pharos Lighthouse.
Paimon: Yep, let's go!
Traveler: The very group that we're about to face.

## Talk 7

Tariq: Alhaitham... I knew you were crazy, but I didn't know you were crazy enough to actually show up.
Alhaitham: It was I who demanded that these negotiations take place. I was more worried that you might go back on your promise, but to your credit, it appears that you're sticking to your word.
Alhaitham: This is turning into quite an occasion. I also brought some backup — I assume you don't mind.
Tariq: Backup? Aren't you the brat from the restaurant the other day? You've come to support this lunatic because he helped you out? Hmph, fine, your funeral.
Tariq: I'm not going to mince my words: once we're done with you, you'll be nothing more than fish food. Get 'em, boys!
Paimon: Uh oh, here they come! Uh, good luck you two!

## Talk 8

Paimon: Huh!? What in Teyvat just happened? It's like that big guy suddenly lost his mind...
Alhaitham: It looks like he used the Divine Knowledge Capsule.
Paimon: You mean, the Divine Knowledge Capsule did that to him?
Traveler: Speaking of which, Haypasia did mention...
Paimon: Oh yeah, you mean how some researchers go insane after getting knowledge from Irminsul?
Alhaitham: I've heard of numerous incidents of researchers in Satyavada Life going insane. The state that man is now in suggests that this is a similar situation.
Alhaitham: This Divine Knowledge Capsule does appear to be linked to the gods, but beyond that, it doesn't seem anything like the rumors suggest. Possessing it doesn't grant you divine wisdom or power.
Alhaitham: Did you hear what he said? "World... forget me..." What could that possibly mean?
Traveler: (That's exactly what I heard before at Irminsul...)
Paimon: If the matra took him away, then that means the Akademiya got the Divine Knowledge Capsule back, too. What a shame, we were so close...
Paimon: Still, Paimon didn't expect the Divine Knowledge Capsule would be so dangerous. Imagine if we'd tried to open it... Who knows what would've happened to us...
Alhaitham: As things stand, there is no reason for me to remain in Port Ormos. I believe our collaboration has also reached its end.
Paimon: Oh, we were so busy trying to find the Divine Knowledge Capsule that Paimon forgot to ask you something! Since you're a member of the Akademiya, do you have any idea how we can go about meeting Lesser Lord Kusanali?
Alhaitham: Truthfully, I don't. Lesser Lord Kusanali appears to exist outside of Sumeru's entire administration. Most of the time, you wouldn't know she exists at all.
Alhaitham: Moreover, since the Akademiya possesses the Akasha, a symbol of our deity's wisdom, scholars have no reason to desire to make contact with the deity herself anyway...
Paimon: *sigh* Everything about Lesser Lord Kusanali is such a mystery.
Alhaitham: I'm heading back to the Akademiya. How about you two?
Paimon: Aah, it's almost the day of the Sabzeruz Festival! Maybe we should head back, too. We've been rushed off our feet over the past few days, so maybe a little rest and relaxation will do us good.
Traveler: You have a point.
Paimon: Then we'll part ways here, Alhaitham. Until we meet again!
Alhaitham: Hmm... Now, do I deal with this thing first, or should I produce the report that the higher-ups require?
Traveler: Let's return to Sumeru City.

## Talk 9

Traveler: (I feel like I just had an epiphany...)
Traveler: (As if I saw countless sword-wielding figures fighting one moment, and then in the next, they disappeared into the recesses of my memory.)
Paimon: Hey, how are you feeling?
Traveler: I felt something for a moment.
Paimon: You mean that it worked?
Alhaitham: Alright, time for round two. Fight with the same composure as before.
Traveler: Whatever was inside the Knowledge Capsule became a part of my memory.
