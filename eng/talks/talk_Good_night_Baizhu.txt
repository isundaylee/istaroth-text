Traveler: Good night, Baizhu.
Baizhu: #Good night, Traveler.
Baizhu: It's important to follow the body's natural rhythm and rest when the sun is down. Staying up at night and napping throughout the day may sound tempting, but it's detrimental to your health.
Baizhu: Ahem, my apologies, I wasn't trying to call you out or anything. I'm just too accustomed to reminding my patients of the importance of sleeping at the right time â€” I hope you don't mind.
