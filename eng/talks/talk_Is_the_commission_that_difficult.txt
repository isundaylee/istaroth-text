Traveler: Is the commission that difficult?
Tommy: Well, it's not, I just need to collect some alchemical reagents. But... I didn't realize that the location was Dragonspine!
Tommy: Once you factor in the location, this suddenly becomes a commission for top-ranking adventurers only!
Tommy: Something clearly went wrong with the Guild's rating for this commission... But I'm also at fault for not checking the details carefully. *sigh*
