Wriothesley: After taking a look around here, I'm wondering whether to expand our library at the Fortress of Meropide.
Wriothesley: Hmm, then again, most of our collection consists of legal advice pamphlets and mechanics textbooks, which no one reads... So, maybe not.
Wriothesley: ...Novels? You're right, those would be more popular — that's also why you can never find them in the library. They disappear from the shelves instantly, never to be seen again...

Wriothesley: If experience is anything to go by, the further in we go, the tougher our enemies will get.
Wriothesley: But even if they don't, getting all the way to the end isn't exactly gonna be a walk in the park.
Wriothesley: Whichever way you cut it, we have to make sure we're fully prepared.

Wriothesley: There are worse ways to kill time than fairytales.
Wriothesley: The simple wording, the childlike wonder, the romanticism — it all makes for some nice easy reading that doesn't require any brainpower.
Wriothesley: Well, until you start noticing some of the more uncomfortable parallels between fantasy and reality.
