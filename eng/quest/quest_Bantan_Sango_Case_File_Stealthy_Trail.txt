# Bantan Sango Case File: Stealthy Trail


## Talk 1

Ryuuji: You're here.
Traveler: Found any leads?
Ryuuji: Yes, thanks to Sango.
Ryuuji: We have largely confirmed a few locations with the aid of her deductions.
Ryuuji: At the moment, it appears that one of the camps is guarded by our "Hat Dog." This location requires greater care.
Traveler: That was a very Paimonial nickname...
Paimon: Hey now! Paimon wouldn't come up with such lame nicknames! If it were up to Paimon...
Paimon: This dog would be called "Blade Pup!"
Ryuuji: ...
Ryuuji: I have placed similar devices around that location. Hopefully, they'll have the same effect as before.
Paimon: Hey! Don't ignore Paimon!
Ryuuji: I'll leave the rest in your hands.
Ryuuji: Any other questions?
Traveler: Can we count on this intel?
Ryuuji: Most certainly. I did scout the areas out myself.
Paimon: Why aren't you coming with us this time, Ryuuji?
Ryuuji: I would have, if not for a certain other task that I must perform for Sango.
Ryuuji: Broadly, she has some ideas as to the source of our "Hat Dog," and has asked that I investigate the matter.
Paimon: It's "Blade Pup"!
Ryuuji: "Hat Dog."
Traveler: "Hat Blade Pup."
Ryuuji: That combination doesn't work.
Paimon: What sort of nickname is that, anyway!?
Ryuuji: Hmm. Perhaps we should just return to calling it "Black Shadow."
Ryuuji: Whatever the case, I leave the animals to you.
Traveler: C'mon, less fighting...

## Talk 2

Ryuuji: Thank you very much. Hmm... These still aren't all of them...
Paimon: That many animals went missing, huh?
Ryuuji: Unfortunately so, yes. Comparing these to the commissions we received, we should have found around half the missing animals.
Ryuuji: Unfortunately, we're out of leads again. Fortunately, live animals are far easier to investigate than inanimate objects, in any case.
Ryuuji: We did receive just such a request from an important family recently.
Ryuuji: Our trail ran cold, and if not for Sango's deductions, we would have lost it altogether.
Traveler: Any details?
Paimon: Yup yup yup! This sounds super interesting â€” c'mon, let's hear some more!
Ryuuji: I didn't know that you were so interested in our work.
Ryuuji: In truth, we had already locked onto our suspect. The trouble was that we could not find any incriminating evidence at his place, nor could we find any other clues.
Ryuuji: Later, I heard, entirely by chance, that our suspect had sold some Naku Weed the day before. I went to the buyer to inspect the product and discovered it was indeed still fresh.
Ryuuji: After hearing this, Sango bade me go to the foothills of Mt. Yougou to investigate.
Paimon: Eh? Why Mt. Yougou?
Ryuuji: "Our suspect lives on Narukami Island. Although Naku Weed can be found all over Inazuma, most people need a boat to get to the other islands, and we found no boat."
Ryuuji: "Additionally, the Tenryou Commission is very touchy about the use of boats due to the Sakoku Decree. If our suspect was planning to commit a crime, they would not have done it such that they would be exposed to the Commission."
Ryuuji: "That thus eliminates the other islands." That was what she said.
Paimon: But there's Naku Weed around the Grand Narukami Shrine, isn't there? Why did you only check the foothills of Mt. Yougou?
Ryuuji: Sango considered this too. "Naku Weed grows around the Grand Narukami Shrine, yes, but the shrine maidens are there, and many worshippers frequent the area."
Ryuuji: "If anything out of the ordinary were to happen there, it would be liable to be found out."
Paimon: Ooh, so that's how it is! Paimon can see why Sango's the brains of the party now!
Ryuuji: As it turned out, we did find a pile of soil in the foothills that showed signs of having been loosened recently. Our suspect had buried the stolen objects there and had been intending to wait out the heat before emerging and fencing these goods.
Ryuuji: But he thought that he might attract suspicion by leaving heavy-laden and returning empty-handed, so he collected Naku Weed along the way and made to sell them.
Paimon: Hah, but it was also the Naku Weed that got him caught!
Ryuuji: Indeed. As such, I believe that there are leads nearby. We just haven't thought to uncover them yet.
Ryuuji: I believe that our present cooperation is quite ideal. After all, my true specialty is running errands, not stealth or combat. Leaving this part to you, in fact, suits me more than just fine.
Ryuuji: What do you think? Do you have any interest in working at Bantan Sango?
Ryuuji: Sango might seem a little... complicated to speak to, and she says strange things like "conscience holds wisdom back," but she is a gentle person at heart.
Traveler: No thanks.
Ryuuji: Ah. That's a shame.
Ryuuji: Well, now that I think about it, this is for the best. If Sango had someone like you, I'd be out of a job.
Ryuuji: I will continue my investigations. If you have other things you need to work on, please do them first.
Ryuuji: We will meet again, when the time comes, at the agency. Thanks once again for your efforts.
Traveler: Thanks, but no thanks.
Traveler: Let's hope it goes well this time, too.
Paimon: Yup! The people who lost their pets must be in a real panic right now...

### Additional Talk 1

Ryuuji: Whatever the case, I leave the animals to you.

### Additional Talk 2

Sango: Ryuuji's informed you of the exact locations, has he? Go, then. This time, the two of you should split up.
Sango: I've got an... interesting hunch about Black Shadow's origins that I'd like him to check out.
