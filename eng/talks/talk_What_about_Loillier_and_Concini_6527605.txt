Traveler: What about Loillier and Concini?
Edwin Eastinghouse: Financial backers for my research, that's all. They only cared about making Mora. They didn't understand the first thing about technology, and couldn't even handle simple tasks like procuring precision instruments.
Edwin Eastinghouse: I'd had enough. I was forced to assemble the instruments myself and rebuild the entire lab.
Edwin Eastinghouse: They ended up being more interested in Nacker's shoddy prototype, and they kicked me out of the lab!
Edwin Eastinghouse: They asked me to work on peripheral suppressors instead. How absurd!
