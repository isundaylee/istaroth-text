Huixin: Oh, it's you. How may I help?
Huixin: I've heard that you contributed greatly to the rebuilding of the Jade Chamber and to the relatively small amount of damage that Liyue Harbor suffered at the hands of our ocean-borne enemy. You have my thanks.
Huixin: Please enjoy the Lantern Rite for the duration of your stay.

Huixin: And you are...? For civil matters, please go to the Liyue Ministry of Civil Affairs.

## Talk

Traveler: I have some questions.
Huixin: Please, ask away! I will answer to the best of my ability.
Traveler: Tell me about Liyue.
Huixin: Oh? I take it that you are not from around here, then.
Huixin: Not that there's any problem with that, we do not exclude anybody here in Liyue! On the contrary, with this being a commercial port, people get nervous if they see a decline in the foreign population.
Huixin: Thanks to the guidance of Rex Lapis, Liyue has gone from strength to strength in the last thousand years.
Huixin: Our forebears discovered the craft of producing glazes via firing. Trade with foreign lands grew, and Liyue prospered.
Huixin: Our biggest point of pride is that Mora, the coins used as currency throughout Teyvat, are cast right here in Liyue at the Golden House. More importantly, Mora are named after Morax, which is Rex Lapis' original name.
Traveler: Tell me about the Qixing.
Huixin: You could say the Qixing are my bosses... Surely it doesn't count as workplace gossip if I'm just giving you their backstories? Haha...
Huixin: The Qixing — or "Seven Stars" — is a Liyue business committee. It is also used as a collective term for the seven business tycoons who sit on the committee and handle Liyue's government affairs.
Huixin: I trust you have heard of Ningguang, of the Jade Chamber? Like her, each Qixing is a major player in business circles whose every action has a profound influence.
Huixin: They are responsible for implementing the policy that comes down from Rex Lapis and making rulings on important matters. They are akin to the hands and feet of Rex Lapis.
Traveler: Could you tell me a bit more about the Qixing?
Huixin: Hmm, the Qixing do in fact have a clear internal division of labor.
Huixin: Besides Lady Ningguang, with whom you are familiar, the Yuheng, Lady Keqing, is in charge of land, construction works and the like.
Huixin: Liyue is very vast, and requires strict regulation and eminent developmental direction...
Huixin: The other esteemed members of the Qixing are also highly accomplished in their own fields. They are the pillars of the prosperity that Liyue enjoys today.
Traveler: Where are we right now?
Huixin: We are at Yuehai Pavilion. This is where the Qixing discuss official business and rule on major issues that affect the whole of Liyue.
Huixin: To serve the Qixing is to serve all of Liyue, so it is my honor to be working here.
Huixin: Sometimes I feel like the whole way I carry myself has become more dignified since I started working here. Hehehe.
Huixin: None of the big shots are here right now — presumably they're all busy with private business.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Huixin: Bye. Good luck with everything.

## Talk

Huixin: Oh, hello. I wasn't expecting visitors at this time.

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing?
Huixin: Yuehai Pavilion is closed at the moment. I like to come here when there is no business to attend to, to stretch my legs and think about things.
Huixin: There is so much that is inscrutable in this world... The seasonal rhythm of the monsoons, the nature of Celestia, destiny itself... and what goes on inside other people's heads...
Huixin: I do wonder what goes on in the minds of the Qixing...
Huixin: Surely the Geo Archon isn't...

## Talk

Traveler: Please excuse me.
Huixin: Bye. Mind your step in the dark.

## Talk

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Huixin: Now that we've sent Rex Lapis off, we will never again receive his direction...
Huixin: ...That burden now falls upon the Qixing.
Huixin: But I don't fear for our future. Other than the Qixing, we do still have Ganyu. She'll do a great job supporting the Qixing, I'm sure of it!

Huixin: Hello, I am Huixin, Secretary of the Yuehai Pavilion. Serving Liyue is my duty.

## Talk

Traveler: Donate Mingxiao Lantern Materials
Huixin: You came all this way to donate materials for the lantern? Such dedication!

## Talk

Traveler: How is progress on the Mingxiao Lantern?
Huixin: Thanks to the generous help of everyone in Liyue, work on the Mingxiao Lantern is now well underway.

## Talk

Traveler: I want to know more about Lantern Rite.
Huixin: Ooh, if this your first Lantern Rite, I could be your guide?
Traveler: What is the Mingxiao Lantern for?
Huixin: Long, long ago, the heroes and the people joined forces to protect the land of Liyue.
Huixin: Since peace was restored, the tradition of everyone coming together to build a giant floating lantern has been observed as a way of keeping that spirit of unity alive.
Huixin: Everyone who can collects materials, donates what they can spare, and helps with the construction work. And on the final night of the festival, the whole city watches as the lantern is released into the air. It's the tradition most integral to Lantern Rite.
Huixin: Do you see the huge stone in the middle of the lantern? It's the largest Plaustrite unearthed this year.
Huixin: How big the Mingxiao Lantern is depends on the size of the biggest Plaustrite from the preceding year. This year is special, because it has the biggest chunk of Plaustrite found in twenty years.
Huixin: In honor of the great heroes who died to protect Liyue, the Mingxiao Lantern's design is always based on the adeptus form of one of the heroes.
Huixin: This year's Mingxiao Lantern depicts the adeptus form of Skybracer. The Yuehai Pavilion chose the theme based on popular demand.
Traveler: What's the Xiao Market?
Huixin: To put it simply, it's one of the attractions for visitors to the festival.
Huixin: A substantial portion of the funding for the Mingxiao Lantern comes from vendors at the market.
Huixin: So although Liyue Harbor's business people can sometimes seem a little tight-fisted, when it comes down to it they're all good people.
Huixin: While everyone's out for the festival, why not talk them, get to know them a bit?

## Talk

Traveler: I just might! Goodbye.
Huixin: Goodbye. May the flames of wisdom spread to all, and never be extinguished.
