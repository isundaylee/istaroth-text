Traveler: So, what have you got around here?
Wakea Nui: Travelers from distant lands can first have a taste of the local cuisine, before enjoying a live music performance and checking out the exquisitely-made records.
Wakea Nui: Once you've recovered from that, you can try out all the water sports we have to offer, and have a jolly good time.
Wakea Nui: If your arms and legs are sore, just have a good soak in the hot springs, and you'll be back up in no time.
Wakea Nui: Come evening, visit the Golden Dusk to watch the sunset and have a nice, iced drink, and that'll be the perfect way to wrap up your day.

Traveler: Well arranged. I'm impressed.
Wakea Nui: Haha, it's the least I can do. Every visitor to our land should get to experience everything we have to offer!
Wakea Nui: So, how about it? Interested in the stuff I mentioned? I'll even book everything for you. All you need to do is show up and enjoy.
Wakea Nui: Oh, and please feel free to bring your friends! The more the merrier!

## Talk 5

Wakea Nui: Mom... For all these years, have you really never felt the need to bring everyone together to expand the family business?
Kupo Nui: Hmm? Why would you ask something like that, my child? Everyone in the family is gainfully employed. Won't you say that they're all hard at work in their own individual spheres?
Wakea Nui: That's exactly what I mean! Instead of each focusing on our own thing, why can't we bring everyone together, so we can all work towards the same goal, and help each other grow?
Kupo Nui: Ahh, I see. Well, if that's how you feel, why not bring it up with the group?
Wakea Nui: *sigh*... But none of them are willing to give me the time of day. It feels like they're all happy to just stick to the status quo...
Kupo Nui: Ah, is that so? Then you should also be happy for them.
Wakea Nui: I can be happy for them, I guess, but I'm a little sad for myself. At this rate, I'll never get a second employee for my international travel agency...
