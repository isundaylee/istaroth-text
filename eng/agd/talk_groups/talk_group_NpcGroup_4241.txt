Traveler: About flowers...
Aragaru: #Festival Utsava was a very happy time, and Nara Traveler also received many flowers.
Aragaru: I am very curious. Why did Golden Nara receive everyone's flowers like the flowers are raindrops converging into river?
Aragaru: I see, so I had given flowers long ago in the story.

## Talk

Traveler: About bad Nara...
Aragaru: I gave the bad Nara flowers. But I don't know who it was, because I don't remember.
Aragaru: But at that time, the bad Nara was definitely not bad yet.
Aragaru: Sometimes, when the bright moon rose, Nara was still a good child. But when the sun rose again, Nara became bad. I don't understand...
Aragaru: #But no matter how many times the sun and moon rise and set, Nara Traveler will always be like Nara Varuna, shining like gold.
