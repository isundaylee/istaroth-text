# Ceaseless Training


## Talk 1

Asakura: Straight lance, straight line... Hah!
Traveler: I'm here to spar again.
Asakura: Oh! It's you. Did you take my commission again? Much obliged!
Asakura: It's truly great to have someone as formidable as you to practice with me.
Traveler: Your skill with a lance has improved a lot.
Asakura: Haha... You jest too much.
Asakura: From what I have heard, one of the reasons why the lance was invented was that it allows someone who doesn't really know how to wield a weapon such as myself to fight with ease.
Asakura: After all, this type of weapon is long and sharp. Even if the wielder doesn't know how to use it, simply stabbing and swinging with it at least appears strong.
Asakura: However, by this rule... I actually think the humble garden fork with its three sharp tips has greater power...
Traveler: Haven't you already taken your weapon back?
Asakura: I did retrieve my weapon, yes, but that doesn't mean that my training is over.
Asakura: I had a run-in with the Kairagi before. It would be presumptuous to say that I will not run into even stronger enemies in the future.
Asakura: I shall never let my weapon fall into the hands of the enemy again, thus allowing my honor as a samurai be desecrated. That's the way of samurai I wish to pursue.

## Talk 2

Asakura: *sigh* Well, that's all for chit-chat. I don't believe that I should be wasting your time.

## Talk 3

Asakura: You seem to have been distracted back then. Your steps were a mess and the strength of your attacks was inconsistent, sometimes strong and sometimes weak...
Asakura: That won't do. Please get ready first, and we shall give it a go again later.

## Talk 4

Asakura: *panting* Your skills are truly far above mine...
Traveler: I'll hold back next time...
Asakura: No! Please use all of your strength. Without practice, I won't grow further.
Asakura: Given your great strength, you must have gone through much training...
Asakura: Forgive me for being blunt, but I am really curious about how you have trained yourself.
Traveler: A giant dragon once helped me practice flying.
Asakura: You... you flew with a giant dragon? That's unimaginable...
Traveler: It's... nothing special.
Asakura: Hahaha, is that so? Then I guess you must be really gifted then.
Asakura: Thank you for sparring with me. I will remember what you have taught me. Please take these as compensation.
Traveler: A great wolf aids me in practicing my martial arts.
Asakura: That sounds truly brave. I really wish I could see you and the great wolf fighting against each other...
