Traveler: What other insights and wisdom can you share? Please, enlighten me...
Jiuguan: We merely met by chance and had a short conversation, so such politeness isn't necessary.
Jiuguan: Tea tasting comes later, and tea preparation comes first. If we do plan to go into it, then we must discuss tea preparation first. And the specifics of it depend on the type of tea.
Jiuguan: For example, Yunlai White Tea is shaped like a silver needle and should not be brewed with boiling water. The water must be allowed to cool until it's at 70% of its boiling temperature.
Jiuguan: First, wet the tea with some hot water, then pour an appropriate amount of water into the pot. Wait patiently for ten minutes until the tea turns a light amber hue. Only then should you take a sip.
Jiuguan: The brewing steps are reversed for Bishui Green Tea. It requires pouring the water first, then the tea leaves...
Jiuguan: And Single-Origin Yauwan Tea, one of the teas Chenyu Vale is famous for, requires brewing at high temperatures. Boiling water must be used after letting it stand for a short moment...
Jiuguan: Besides that, Single-Origin Yauwan Tea should be paired with small teapots and teacups, and every pot must not be filled with too much water...
Jiuguan: I fear that the details cannot be captured with so few words.
Jiuguan: Fortunately for you, I heeded Mr. Fryslan's advice and made the artisans of my teahouse co-write a book on tea preparation and tasting.
Jiuguan: If you would like to delve deeper into the various teas and their intricacies, you can consider waiting until the book is finished. I'm certain a careful read of it will enlighten you.
