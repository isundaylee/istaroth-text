## Talk 1

Investigate: "In the light of alternating day cycles, one can see the homeward figure of the lighthouse on the bridge."
Paimon: Whâ€”What is this...? A riddle? Or a proverb or something...?
Paimon: Alternating day cycles? Homeward figure...
Kamal: Hello, traveler. Are you interested in Drusus's riddle too?
Traveler: Is it really a riddle?
Kamal: It was set up by an Akademiya researcher named Drusus.
Kamal: As far as I know, he's an eccentric even among the Akademiya crowd.
Kamal: He loves to talk about riddles with anyone, as well as research all kinds of encryption methods.
Kamal: But some of his riddles are too incomprehensible, so not many people are willing to deal with him.
Kamal: So he came up with the "solve riddles for prizes" idea.
Kamal: Simply put, this riddle actually hints at a treasure trove.
Kamal: You just have to show up at the right place at the right time using the right method and you'll get the treasure.
Kamal: Drusus also gave a hint, saying that the locations are all within Sumeru City.
Kamal: But as you can see, no adventurer has been able to succeed.
Kamal: You can certainly try if you're interested.
Kamal: But if you ask me, I'd tell you to do something else more productive...
Traveler: Do you know who set it up?

## Talk 4

Drusus: Is no one coming today either...?
Traveler: Is this the "front door of the Temple of Knowledge"?
Drusus: That's right! This is the front door of the Temple of Knowledge. You seem to have solved all my riddles.
Drusus: And that's wonderful! I thought no one would be able to do that today either! Actually, I'm going back to have lunch soon...
Traveler: Why did you write these riddles?
Drusus: Because it's fun, of course.
Paimon: That was a quick answer!
Drusus: Other than that reason, why do you think I wrote down these riddles?
Drusus: Did you think that I was just enjoying being difficult?
Traveler: Who knows...
Drusus: Hahaha, then you have misunderstood me, like some people in the Akademiya.
Drusus: I wrote these riddles down because I simply enjoy the feeling of pondering that comes with puzzling them out.
Drusus: When you look back at my riddles, you can see that there is always a keyword leading to the final answer.
Drusus: If you use this keyword as a base and keep thinking about it, the final answer will gradually present itself.
Drusus: If I'd simply wanted to make things difficult for others, I would erase all the clues and turn the riddle into a truly unsolvable problem.
Drusus: Let's not talk about this now. Since you've solved all my riddles, you can take these.
Drusus: This is the reward you've won with your pondering. Keep them.
Traveler: I don't know.
