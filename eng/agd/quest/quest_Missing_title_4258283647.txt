## Talk 1

Message Board (Akademiya Public Message Board): All Akademiya notifications and executive announcements have been moved to the Akasha. This message board is reserved for communications between instructors and students only. No outsider comments are permitted!

## Talk 2

Message Board (Message): "For a more relaxed academic atmosphere, better scholarly exchanges, and writing papers with a smile!"
Message Board (Message): "We support Vikram as the next Grand Conservator!"
Message Board (Message): "You are welcome to join the 'Friends of Vikram Fraternity,' where we shall witness the rise of a young, personable, and fun Grand Conservator!"

## Talk 3

Message Board (Message): "Never forget the three virtues and six sins of the Akademiya."
Message Board (Message): "Admonition, Ingenuity, and Praxis... Virtues all researchers should aspire to."
Message Board (Message): "Three virtues that Rifaet has been practicing for decades."
Message Board (Message): "The 'Fravashi Reader Society' welcomes you to walk with wisdom and the future Grand Conservator."

## Talk 4

Message Board (Message): "To all members, I salute you for your pursuit of virtues."
Message Board (Message): "But I've heard over half of Rifaet's papers were ghostwritten."
Message Board (Message): "That is why he stayed so low-key despite many achievements."
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "Although sufficient evidence isn't required for a message board like for papers, the message board is not for personal attacks, either."
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "All those comments were made simply out of jealousy!"
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "I also heard that Vikram won the hearts of a lot of girls with his eloquence."
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "They don't even know he's married. So, are you jealous of his popularity?"
Message Board (Matra's Message): "Unfounded attacks on Akademiya researchers are prohibited. Individuals who further fabricate rumors will be turned over to the Matra."

## Talk 5

Message Board (Matra's Message): "This message board is not yet a part of the Akasha Access and may be accessed without the system."
Message Board (Matra's Message): "Please be aware that posts outside of the normal scholarly realms are strictly prohibited."

## Talk 6

Message Board (Matra's Message): "A gentle reminder, please observe Akademiya protocols and etiquette outside the campus as well."
Message Board (Matra's Message): "Centralized management of knowledge is the cornerstone for the 'Land of Wisdom.' Don't forfeit the opportunity to study in the Akademiya because of unintentional mistakes."

## Talk 7

Message Board (Matra's Message): "Several cases of Canned Knowledge smuggling have been detected recently. Detailed information will be released to the mentors and students of the relevant schools through the Akasha before the next Jnagarbha Day, following an investigation."
Message Board (Matra's Message): "Mentors are encouraged to improve communication with students to ease their mental stress caused by paper writing and prevent potential crimes."

## Talk 8

Message Board (Message): "Some might say the Akademiya is pushing the Akasha way too much. Well, I think it's not enough. Most Mahamata have a low productivity, and are even worse than ones we had in the past in some respects."
Message Board (Message): "Just think, if we can assign work directly through the Akasha, and also let it manage trading in the Exchange..."
Message Board (Message): "We can lay off at least half of the Mahamata."
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "You make a lot of sense. Maybe that's why we're not doing it."

## Talk 9

Message Board (Message): "As we all know, it is the researchers' job to delve into profound knowledge. However, the current Akademiya is too mired in administrations."
Message Board (Message): "Now, many students are forced to stop their research and get sent to be Mahamata elsewhere after completing their studies. Doesn't that contradict the purpose of the Akademiya?"
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "Wasn't a conclusion already reached on the Akasha long ago?"
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "While folks still indulge in superstitions, we are the closest to the real truth. How can we relieve ourselves of the duty to illuminate the world? If we stop caring, Sumeru will descend into chaos!"

## Talk 10

Message Board (Message): "As a student studying abroad, I feel the Great Lord's greatness more each day that I'm in the Akademiya."
Message Board (Message): "In Mondstadt's time, it would take digging through a dozen books just to sort out the different theories to a simple question."
Message Board (Message): "But the relevant info is available on the Akasha Terminal just by thinking about it. I believe there's no better creation in the world."

## Talk 11

Message Board (Message): "Ever since Pir Kavikavus, the Akademiya has never increased the annual funding for Kshahrewar."
Message Board (Message): "Those above only advocated strict control of machine and tech developments to ensure a stable, peaceful society. I'd say you might as well shut down the Akasha in that case!"
Message Board (Message): "If it wasn't for long-term funding from astute businessmen like Lord Sangemah Bay, Kshahrewar would've been gone long ago!"

## Talk 12

Message Board (Message): "Although I trust the sages and mentors' judgment, does the Akademiya rely too much on Akasha?"
Message Board (Message): "It's obvious that the level of traveling scholars we sent out has gone down once we got accustomed to using Akasha. I think it's necessary to restrict access to Akasha for new students."
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "How could you say that? Don't you know the cults in the desert without Akasha have resorted to devouring raw poisonous snakes to gain wisdom?"
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "Other than Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, it's the Akasha that ensured the purity of our knowledge."

## Talk 13

Message Board (Forest Watcher Announcement): This week's botany seminar presented by Forest Watcher Tighnari will take place at Pardis Dhyai as usual. Everyone is welcome to sign up.
Message Board (Forest Watcher Announcement): Everyone interested in botany may come, regardless of who you are!
Message Board (Official Akademiya Notice): Apologies, due to too many people signing up for the seminar, the Akademiya has decided to limit attendance to Amu{RUBY#[S]Biology}rta students and ranger personnel.

## Talk 14

Message Board (Message): "Anyone read the latest novel from Yae Publishing House? It's by a Sumeru author named Pursina or something... Obviously an Amurta."
Message Board (Message): "If only I got into Amurta... I could sightsee all day and still got time to write stories. Nope, I just had to end up in Haravatat, where it's only researching and writing papers for me, with no chance of seeing the outside."
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "What, someone got published by Yae Publishing House before I did? That's going to hurt my credibility as a light novel authority..."

## Talk 15

Message Board (Message): "Actual business is run completely different from what the textbooks described... If only I had stayed in the Grand Bazaar."
Message Board (Message): "Now I can't write papers and am out of money."
Message Board (Message): "If this keeps up, I better drop out of school and join the Eremites."

## Talk 16

Message Board (Message): "It's not I'm biased towards anyone from the desert, but I think the General Mahamatra should be a renowned researcher, especially for academic issues that couldn't be solved with fisticuffs."
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "Heh, it's still a lot better than when you Rtawahist were running things, at least there's no bias. Or do you really think no one knows the real stories behind the annual publication rate?"
Message Board (Message): "Listen, you Kshahrewar! You better have proofs or I'll take this up with the matra!"

## Talk 17

Message Board (Message): "I can stand accepting foreign enrollees, but letting them access the Akasha is another thing entirely..."
Message Board (Message): "Putting aside the influence foreign minds might exert on the Akasha, who knows how much damage the outgoing knowledge will do to Sumeru trading."
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "Researchers concerned about economics? That's fresh."
Message Board (Message): "That's why you Haravatat are known as snobs. I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to learn to create a better paint!"

## Talk 18

Message Board (Message): "Haven't seen that desert dwarf in a while... Guess we can relax a bit."
Message Board (Message): "Wonder what got into the disciplinary staff to stop me from passing the evaluation this semester."
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "You can pass the evaluation just by showing up, so don't blame others for you not studying. And even though the matra is short-staffed, still be careful what you say."
Message Board (Message): "The matra is just the hierarchy flaunting their authority. Hold on, I just got a message from the Akasha..."
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "Guess we all ought to watch our steps."

## Talk 19

Message Board (Redacted Message): "...Regarding the investigation of Zandik... Dastur... Cause of death... Possible murder..."
Message Board (Redacted Message): "...Zandik... following the delisting... regarding Eleazar... but lacking evidence..."
Message Board (Redacted Message): "...Records suddenly disappeared... Year unknown... Eleazar outbreak began..."
Message Board (Redacted Message): "...Prior to disappearance... Legend of Varuna... obsessed with..."
Message Board (Redacted Message): (The following content has been thoroughly defaced as to be completely incomprehensible.)

## Talk 20

Message Board (Message): "After perusing the Starlog by the great sage of Tabari, I finally realized whether it be the war of gods or downfall of ancient empires, it was all a microcosm of the celestial movements."
Message Board (Message): "The starry sky above us is the only thing eternal."
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "Uh, sentimentality aside, are you Rtawahist just going to summarize all ancient events in one lump sum?"
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "Wish you would examine it from the historical perspective, not just stargaze and contemplate."
Message Board (Message): "What do you know!? This is called exploring the laws of the universe! No wonder all you Vahumana are bookworms!"

## Talk 21

Message Board (Message): "As a student studying abroad, I feel the Dendro Archon's greatness more each day that I'm in the Akademiya."
Message Board (Message): "In Mondstadt's time, it would take digging through a dozen books just to sort out the different theories to a simple question."
Message Board (Message): "But the relevant info is available on the Akasha Terminal just by thinking about it. I believe there's no better creation in the world."
