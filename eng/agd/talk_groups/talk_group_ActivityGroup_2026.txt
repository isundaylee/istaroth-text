## Talk 0

"Thelxie" Development Log (I): ...Attempted to install a language output module for Thelxie. The output signal will use a similar cipher to the one once used by the House of the Hearth...
"Thelxie" Development Log (I): The benefits are twofold. Not only does the warehouse at the House of Hearth already have many spare old motherboards, this approach will also make the language module compatible with the diving helmet's transcription module, allowing for quick and easy transcription and testing...
"Thelxie" Development Log (I): As for the offset of the cipher, it will just be set to *1* for convenience...

## Talk 1

"Thelxie" Development Log (II): ...I've hit a snag. I had planned to apply for a transcription module to use for Thelxie, and it would have been the same one as the one used in the diving helmet, but the warehouse is out of stock...
"Thelxie" Development Log (II): ...Seems like I'll have to make one from scratch using the one I have as a reference. I'll start looking into it, but it's unclear if I'll have enough time...

## Talk 2

"Thelxie" Development Log (III): ...I've already spent more time than planned on the transcription module. The work on Thelxie's main body will be affected if I keep at this. I'll have to put it on hold...
"Thelxie" Development Log (III): ...Although the diving helmet can still be used to decipher Thelxie's output signal, it'll probably be unintelligible to everyone else. What a pity...
"Thelxie" Development Log (III): ...I'm sorry for not being able to give you a voice, Thelxie...
