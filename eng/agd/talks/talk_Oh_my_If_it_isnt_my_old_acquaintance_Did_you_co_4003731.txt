Ying'er: Oh my~ If it isn't my old acquaintance. Did you come all this way during Lantern Rite to see me?
Ying'er: Of course, you look as lovely as ever.
Ying'er: It's just a shame that we're so busy, even though it's the festival period...
Ying'er: But either way, why don't you feast your eyes on what we've got in store? Who knows, you might chance upon some extra benefits.
Ying'er: I mean, I'm just a slap of lipstick and a dab of makeup compared to these beauties.
