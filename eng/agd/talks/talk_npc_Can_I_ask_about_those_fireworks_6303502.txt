Traveler: Can I ask about those fireworks?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Ahaha, well, I'm no longer the owner of Naganohara Fireworks.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: I am far too old. My ears aren't as sharp as they were before, so I left the shop to my daughter.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: However, even if I no longer run the shop anymore, I am still very confident in my ability to make fireworks! The fireworks from my shop are guaranteed to be the best. Everyone from Inazuma knows about the Naganohara Fireworks Show.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: The other shops can't even hope to match the fireworks I've made in terms of styles and variety. Hahaha!
