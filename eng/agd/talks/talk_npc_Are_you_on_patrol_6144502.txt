Traveler: Are you on patrol?
Aramis: Yes. I'm responsible for security in the vicinity of the Cathedral. I patrol the stairs in front of the Cathedral's entrance.
Aramis: I am proud to have this job because I get to guard the Anemo Archon statue. But I must say, these stairs are taking their toll on my knees...
Aramis: *sigh* I shudder to think whether I'll be able to keep doing this in ten years' time.
