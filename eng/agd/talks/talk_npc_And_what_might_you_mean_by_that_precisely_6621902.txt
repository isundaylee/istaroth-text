Traveler: And what might you mean by that, precisely?
Ixim: Ah, I'm referring to the content of Phlogiston Engravings.
Ixim: Each pattern has its own unique meaning. Some are just graffiti, pure and simple, which is what I meant by "casual" work.
Ixim: Others have a more profound meaning and can produce actual effects. These I'd call "serious."
Ixim: But those are the minority, and I don't recommend that you carry a symbol weighed down with too much meaning on your person.
Ixim: Graffiti is a more popular form of Phlogiston Engraving, and the satisfaction and fulfillment it provides far outweighs any practical uses.
