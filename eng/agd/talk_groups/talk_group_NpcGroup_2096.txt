Tiantian: Does the Adventurers' Guild do those?
Tiantian: Of course! Clue's in the name, specifically the 'adventure' part.
Tiantian: Hehe, c'mon, don't look so skeptical. I'm actually an expert in adventuring, you know!
Tiantian: ...Because I've read every last book on the topic from the Wanwen Bookhouse. I know my stuff!
Tiantian: I thought adventurers just did commissions?
Tiantian: Commissions? ...Oh, I know — you mean rich people who want the experience of going on an adventure, but also have safety concerns, so they hire us to take them on survival trips in the wild. Right?
Tiantian: Trust me, all I need is my trusty knife and I can survive in any environment you put me in!
Tiantian: If you join the Adventurers' Guild, I promise you will become an expert just like me in no time! Then you can take all the commissions you want!
