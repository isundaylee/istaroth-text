Traveler: Who's the author you're in charge of...?
Kuroda: Hmm? Oh yeah, that reminds me. The author that I handle is an outlander as well. Have you ever heard of Mister Chang from Liyue? He once won an award in the "This Novel Is Amazing!" contest. "The First Apprentice of Guhua" is one of his well-known works.
Kuroda: ...You say you've met this person in Liyue before? Could it be a coincidence... Anyway, I originally wanted him to come up with a cooler pseudonym, but he refused to do that and insisted on using his real name.
Kuroda: Still, it's thanks to him that I've got the reputation I have as an editor. I only wish that he can find his muse soon and come up with some new works.
Kuroda: *sigh* If it weren't for the Sakoku Decree, I would have gone to Liyue to push... Uh, I mean, to visit him.
