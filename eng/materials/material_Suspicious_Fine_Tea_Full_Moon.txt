# Suspicious Fine Tea, Full Moon

A tea pastry containing egg yolk. As you pick it up, layers flake away like loose earth in a landslide. The first bite is sticky, sweet, cloying... And uh-oh, something gets stuck in your throat. Get some water to wash it down, then think about what to do with the rest.
