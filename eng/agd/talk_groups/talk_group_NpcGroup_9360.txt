Yaoyao: You look tired, do you need to take a rest?
Yaoyao: If you're feeling peckish, I've brought some Fried Radish Balls. I made them before we came here.
Yaoyao: Try to take life at a slower pace â€” it's good for your health!

## Talk 1

Yaoyao: I sometimes have to face dangerous enemies when I'm out in the mountains gathering herbs. Like those greedy-gut Treasure Hoarders, or a boar in a bad mood.
Yaoyao: I know that not everywhere is gonna be as peaceful as the place where I grew up with my mom and dad. And Master won't always be there to protect me.
Yaoyao: That's why I practice the spear, even though I don't really like it. It's so I can drive those pesky varmints off all by myself!

## Talk 2

Yaoyao: The kinds of books that adults read have so many complicated ideas in them. I can't wrap my head around them no matter how hard I try.
Yaoyao: Master says that there are many things I'll understand once I'm older.
Yaoyao: So does that mean that when you grow up, you understand the same things in a different way?
