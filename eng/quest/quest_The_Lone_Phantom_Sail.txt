# The Lone Phantom Sail


## Talk 1

Ahes: This is the place! We've arrived!
Ahes: Um, please wait just a moment... Allow me to tune the conch a bit.
Paimon: Huh? "Tune"... a conch? Is that a part of the grilling process...?
Ahes: Oh, come on. All you know is eat, eat, eat! This is a military conch for communication!
Traveler: A... military conch?
Ahes: Yes, this is an old military conch. Ancient sailors used conches as a tool to communicate with each other... It must be a relic left behind from when the navy still existed. I found it in a sunken wreck.
Ahes: When I tuned the conch here last time, I heard her response. Since you've seen her, I think you should be able to hear her response too!
Ahes: But you'll have to wait a moment, you know! I have to tune the conch before I can send out the proper signal.
Traveler: In other words, that ship can receive a specific signal.
Ahes: Yes, that's correct. However, both the time of day and the conditions of the sea will affect the conch's signal generation, so you have to constantly tune it to make sure it'll work. Hehe... that's the problem with antiques.
Ahes: Hmm, anyway, please wait while I tune this conch to align with the vibration of the waves. Don't go running too far away now!
Black Screen Text: Ahes deftly works with the conch in her hand, and not long after, the tuning is complete...
Ahes: Okay, that's it! Hehe, I've learned a lot from those ancient seafarer manuals!
Ahes: Now, allow me to give you a little primer. There are three kinds of short signals that I usually use...
Ahes: "Long low note, short low note, long low note." Yes... This one should mean... Well, my guess is that it probably means "Ready and waiting."
Ahes: "Long low note, long low note, long low note, long low note, long low note." This one means... Um, I'm not actually sure, but the response I received last time was something like that, so it's definitely useful for something!
Ahes: "Short low note, long low note, short low note, long low note, short low note, long low note, short low note, long low note, short low note, long low note"... Phew! This is a long one, for sure! This is the signal that has the highest likelihood of receiving a response, and as for its meaning...
Ahes: According to the manual at least... it means "I have a message to send."
Paimon: Hmm... So, what should we do to figure out the signal that will receive a response?
Traveler: Use deduction to find the corresponding signal?
Ahes: Yuck, no way. That's far too random, and we have too little concrete information... It's true that I've received some mysterious responses back after sending out these three signals, but...
Ahes: But I've yet to discover any logical relationship between the signals and the appearance of the Sponsian...
Ahes: So, all we can do is to try them all, one at a time...
Ahes: So, which one should we start with?
Traveler: Let's try the signals one at a time?
Paimon: Uh... Can't we use some sort of time-saving method... or something a bit smarter? Like... deduction or something!
Traveler: You try, Paimon.
Paimon: Hehe... If Paimon was to start using deductive reasoning, then why don't we make a chart and find the signal with the highest response rate? That should be the signal we're looking for!
Ahes: ...Hmm, though we are in Fontaine, and most ships are required to respond to signals by law... the ship we're looking for isn't normal in any sense of the word, you know?
Ahes: So, we can't expect her to consistently respond to the same signals... In other words, the fundamental requirements for deductive reasoning to work simply don't apply here. Too many things are random, and we lack any evidence to work off of.
Paimon: Urgh... Th—Then let's just try them one at a time...
Traveler: So are you saying... that she will appear when you send the signal?
Ahes: Hehe, pretty cool, isn't it? She's just like a whale! You sing, and she responds. I've heard the sound with my own ears, it's true.

## Talk 2

Ahes: Strange... Why won't she show herself?
Paimon: Gah... Even though Paimon can't see that ship, so far, she's still been following you two around on this wild goose chase...
Paimon: But since it disappeared here, perhaps it's a hint to tell us to find something? For all you know, there might be lost treasure here!
Ahes: Hehe, little jellyfish Paimon sure is greedy.
Ahes: But what we're looking for isn't treasure at all... Yes, if we have to give it a name, isn't it closer to "proof"?
Traveler: By "proof," you mean...?
Ahes: Proof that the Sponsian passed through this place. Such as a navigation log, any wreckage from the boat itself, or nautical tools... Anyway, we should be able to find something related to her!
Paimon: Oh... so no treasure then...
Ahes: We can use the conch to send out sounds, and analyze the returning sound waves to determine the ship's approximate location.
Traveler: Don't despair, Paimon. There might be treasure too.
Paimon: Yeah! That's just what Paimon thinks!
Ahes: Perhaps... But we're not here to find sunken treasure this time. What we want is proof that the "Sponsian" passed this way.
Ahes: Navigation logs, wreckage from the boat itself, or nautical tools... Anyway, we should be able to find something related to her!

## Talk 3

Traveler: Let's start with the one of middling length.

## Talk 4

Traveler: I choose the longest one.

## Talk 5

Ahes: "Long low note, long low note, long low note, long low note, long low note" — that's how this signal's supposed to go.
Traveler: Alright, got it!
Ahes: Hehe, you've got this!
Traveler: Conches really are tough to operate...
Ahes: Well, in that case... Hehe, maybe I should do it myself, then!
Traveler: Don't worry. I'll give this another go.
Ahes: Thank you!
Traveler: Alright, we're counting on you.
Ahes: I'll take it from here, then!
Black Screen Text: Ahes sends the signal with the conch...

## Talk 6

Ahes: What happened here... It's a complete mess. There isn't even a complete wreck, it's mostly just... fragments.
Traveler: Signs point to her being still further up ahead.
Ahes: But she must have suffered irreparable damage, so why would she still forge onward in such poor condition? Unless... Hmm. I think we'll find out why soon.
Paimon: So many tiny little pieces everywhere! It's like she was *chomp* bitten in half by a giant sea monster!
Ahes: ...

## Talk 7

Ahes: Which is to say, the Sponsian suffered heavy damage, and the damage was related to the abyss expedition, and... she continued to sail on. In that case...
Ahes: Let's use the conch to send out another signal! Maybe we'll hear her response from up ahead!
Ahes: Oh right, right! The signals you want to send are "long low note, short low note, long low note"...
Ahes: "Long low note, long low note, long low note, long low note, long low note," and... Uh...
Ahes: "Short low note, long low note, short low note, long low note, short low note, long low note, short low note, long low note, short low note, long low note"... Gah, this one is super lengthy! But these three signals should all get you a response!

## Talk 8

Ahes: What's wrong, did you forget? The signals you want to send are: "Low, high, low"...
Ahes: "Low, low, low, low, low" and... um...
Ahes: "High, low, high, low, high, low, high, low, high, low"... Phew, that's long! But these three signals should all get you a response!

## Talk 9

Paimon: Huh... It's a box and a... bucket? Maybe we should open them up and take a look? They just might be...
Ahes: Rocks. They are rocks.
Paimon: Yeah! Really valuable rocks!
Ahes: Hahaha, silly Paimon! They're ballast! Ballast used to stabilize the weight of the battleship!
Paimon: Eh? Oh... then... Paimon guesses that there's no such thing as valuable ballast then...
Ahes: But since we found so much ballast dumped in a single location, perhaps the ship had to execute an emergency maneuver to increase buoyancy...
Ahes: In other words, she must have been forced to take extreme measures to evade danger, despite being the flagship of the ironclad armada...

## Talk 10

Paimon: Whoa, look! This wreckage must've once been the ship we were chasing earlier — or, well, half of it anyway...
Ahes: ...!
Ahes: Sh—She's all torn up...
Paimon: Hey... Don't be so sad, Ahes... We couldn't have expected things to turn out like this, right?
Ahes: I know, but... Oh, forget it... I'll go look around and see if there's anything worth investigating...
Paimon: #Yeah, there might be some good stuff left... C'mon, Traveler, let's have a look around as well!

## Talk 11

Paimon: In other words, this ship must've sunk during the struggle against the sea monster...
Paimon: Then this half was torn up by the waves and floated on the ocean currents before finally settling here.
Traveler: And if it was indeed destroyed by the monster...
Paimon: Wait, but wouldn't that mean that she really was bitten in half? ... Huh? What's that noise?
Paimon: Ugh, more monsters! Here they come again!
Traveler: Paimon, hide!
Paimon: But... but... Okay!
Traveler: ...Then her other half might still be inside its body.

## Talk 12

Traveler: Let's start from the shortest one.

## Talk 13

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): "...Oh leave her, sailors, leave her..."
"...Tomorrow you'll get your pay, and it's time for us to leave her..."
"...Oh leave her, sailors, leave her..."
"For the voyage is done and the winds don't blow, so it's time for us to leave her..."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): "...No grog allowed and rotten grub, and it's time for us to leave her..."
"...Oh leave her, sailors, leave her..."
"...The sails all furled, our work is done, and it's time for us to leave her..."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): As the dream-like shanty dissolves into the ocean waves, a sorrowful voice comes from the strange pendant...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): "Blue, like a little sailor... I saw her... Haha..."
"She had the scent of sea monsters on her..."
"But she is a good child. Perhaps she will not get my flagship dirty..."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): "Heh, it's a shame I couldn't protect her well enough. She was a good boat..."

## Talk 14

Paimon: Hmm... Busted wooden planks, oars, and... the wreck of a small boat. There's nothing worth looking at here...
Ahes: It's a lifeboat... So even the lifeboats were destroyed? ...Oh? Look over there. What's that between the boards?
Paimon: Hmmm... It looks like a scrap of paper... Is it the log? Should we take it out and have a look?
Traveler: They came here to fight against monsters from the Abyss...
Ahes: Yes... I have heard of legends regarding them before. But... does that mean that the Sponsian has already...
Ahes: Hmph! This isn't enough proof. Let's go to the next location.

## Talk 15

Ahes: Do you still remember the signal? It goes "Short low note, long low note, short low note, long low note, short low note, long low note, short low note, long low note, short low note, long low note"!
Ahes: Hehe, it's pretty long, huh?
Traveler: Alright, got it!
Ahes: Hehe, you've got this!
Traveler: Conches really are tough to operate...
Ahes: Well, in that case... Hehe, maybe I should do it myself, then!
Traveler: Don't worry. I'll give this another go.
Ahes: Thank you!
Traveler: Alright, we're counting on you.
Ahes: I'll take it from here, then!
Black Screen Text: Ahes sends the signal with the conch...

## Talk 16

Paimon: #Traveler, are you alright?
Paimon: You told Paimon to hide, and then you went wild on those slimes... Then you picked up a handful of sand and started talking to yourself!
Paimon: What happened to you just now? You scared Paimon half to death!
Traveler: I witnessed the moments before the ship sank...
Paimon: Huh? Wait... So you thought you were fighting a group of monsters from the Abyss? No wonder you had that scarily serious look on your face!
Paimon: Hmph. If you ask Paimon, this is all Verenata's potions' fault!
Ahes: What's with all that noise! What are you doing!? Were you trying to haul the wreck off while I wasn't around?
Paimon: Hmm... Is the wood from shipwrecks like these worth a lot?
Ahes: I don't know... Hey, is that really what you're planning!? You... naughty jellyfish!
Ahes: Hmm... Even though it's in pieces... Well, bits of it can still be collected as souvenirs...
Ahes: I'm afraid it's probably impossible to restore its original white ironclad appearance... But I can still explore her past experiences... Maybe...
Traveler: Captain Basil seems to have been really fond of you.
Ahes: E—Eh? What...?
Paimon: #It's nothing! Traveler has been acting strange ever since just now... Maybe some rest will do the trick!
Ahes: #Hahahaha! Don't say that, Paimon! I believe Traveler saw something we didn't. Well... at the very least, there's no harm in thinking this way.
Ahes: Just like... how I believe Captain Basil has always been supporting me...
Ahes: I will find a way to gradually restore her logbook and nautical chart so that her adventures and stories can be marked accurately on our maps!
Ahes: That's what I want to do. Although... the meaning of some names may be lost, and the location of some ports may be known to no one...
Paimon: That doesn't matter! We can just leave it to people who come after to rediscover them!
Ahes: Yes! Thank you for helping me locate the Sponsian! Please accept this gift of mine!
Paimon: Hehe, okay! See you!
Traveler: I heard Captain Basil's voice.
Traveler: I picked up this silver pendant.
Paimon: A pendant? But there's nothing in your hands but sand! Huh? Wait, there's also a really small conch...
Paimon: Wait, so you were talking to this "imaginary pendant"? ... That's just the contents of the logbook earlier confusing you, right?

## Talk 17

Traveler: Let's start from the longest one.

## Talk 18

Traveler: Let's start from the shortest one.

## Talk 19

Traveler: Let's start with the one of middling length.

## Talk 20

Traveler: I'm not sure. What would you prefer, Ahes?
Ahes: Ah, me? Um... if you're asking me, then I would pick this one.
Black Screen Text: Ahes sends the signal with the conch...

## Talk 21

Ahes: Eh... Did you hear it?
Paimon: Huh? What...
Ahes: Shh, the signal... Wait... Her! It's her, she's over there! In the distance!
Paimon: What? Paimon... Paimon can't see anything!
Traveler: I saw it.
Ahes: Yes! I knew you'd able to see it too! Quick, after her, let's catch up!
Paimon: Catch... catch what? The ship? Have you two grown sails and sprouted oars or something!?

## Talk 22

Ahes: Oh, did you forget the signal? It's "long low note, short low note, long low note."
Traveler: Alright, got it!
Ahes: Hehe, you've got this!
Traveler: Conches really are tough to operate...
Ahes: Well, in that case... Hehe, maybe I should do it myself, then!
Traveler: Don't worry. I'll give this another go.
Ahes: Thank you!
Traveler: Alright, we're counting on you.
Ahes: I'll take it from here, then!
Black Screen Text: Ahes sends the signal with the conch...
