Connor: Welcome to Dawn Winery! Are you here for a tour?
Traveler: Who are you?
Connor: I am Connor, a winemaker at Dawn Winery. I have been making wine here since the days when Master Crepus Ragnvindr directed the business.
Connor: Master Crepus was the father of Master Diluc, as well as the founder and the first owner of this fine winery.
Connor: Unfortunately, Mr. Crepus died in his prime, and now the burden of running the winery falls on Master Diluc's shoulders...
Traveler: Tell me about wine making.
Connor: Dandelion wine is the signature product of our winery, offering a unique sweetish and refreshing taste, and rich in cereal aroma.
Connor: As to how it is produced, I suggest you seek the answers in "On Beer Brewing" and "Distillation Technology."
Connor: They are thoroughly written books and easy to find in the library. But Master Diluc has never read them, not even once...
Traveler: About Diluc...
Connor: Although Master Diluc appears to have little interest in wine,
Connor: I believe he bears the same talent in winemaking as his father, only waiting for the right time to reveal itself.
Connor: The only question is, when will that time come?
Traveler: Goodbye...
Connor: Are you leaving? If you happen to meet Master Diluc...
Connor: No, never mind... Please enjoy your stay at Dawn Winery.
