# Yanxiao's Crazy Kitchen


## Talk 1

Smiley Yanxiao: Ah, yes. I've already asked Yuhua to bring the food down to those two customers. They're pretty pleased with it, too — thanks for making that trip.
Smiley Yanxiao: So, are all the other matters settled?
Traveler: I've sent those meals out.
Smiley Yanxiao: Good, good — have you bought the ingredients as well?

## Talk 2

Smiley Yanxiao: This is bad...
Traveler: Something the matter?
Smiley Yanxiao: Lantern Rite's the matter, what else? We've had lots of staff head back to the city to spend the festive period there, so we've got our hands full right now.
Smiley Yanxiao: Haven't the time for idle chat right now. Need to get ready for the guests' orders at night — doubt I'll even have time to get a sip of water.
Smiley Yanxiao: If you cared enough to check on me, you might as well help out later tonight.
Smiley Yanxiao: *sigh* What I'd do for some help right now. Where's that Yuhua run off to...

## Talk 3

Smiley Yanxiao: Argh, I need a rest. My hands are so sore that I can barely lift my wok...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Smiley Yanxiao: Ah, Traveler! I was just wondering how nice it'd be if I could have some help. You up for it?
Traveler: What sort of help...
Smiley Yanxiao: Most all our staff have headed back to spend the Lantern Rite in the city. We're so short-handed right now that we can barely keep our heads above water, so any help is good help.
Smiley Yanxiao: You needn't worry, we don't expect you to do any heavy lifting. Just need to help us serve some dishes and gather some ingredients.
Smiley Yanxiao: Give me a moment, let me see what we can get you to do right now...

## Talk 4

Smiley Yanxiao: Ack, I forgot to take orders from the customers at that table downstairs.
Smiley Yanxiao: How about this? Go and take orders from those two guests downstairs, Holderlin and Caspar.
Smiley Yanxiao: They've been waiting for a while now, so they might be getting annoyed. Just remember to bring them *two* side dishes. Some *Delicious Chicken-Mushroom Skewer* should do the trick.
Smiley Yanxiao: After the sides have been served, ask them what they'd like to have for their main course — save yourself that extra trip.
Smiley Yanxiao: Alright, run along now. Don't keep them waiting.

## Talk 5

Traveler: Golden Shrimp Balls.
Smiley Yanxiao: No problem, this won't be hard.
Smiley Yanxiao: And what would Caspar like to eat?

## Talk 6

Traveler: Jueyun Chili Chicken.
Smiley Yanxiao: No problem, this won't be hard.
Smiley Yanxiao: What would Caspar like to eat?

## Talk 7

Smiley Yanxiao: Ack, I forgot to take orders from the customers at that table downstairs.
Smiley Yanxiao: How about this? Go and take orders from those two guests downstairs, Holderlin and Caspar.
Smiley Yanxiao: They've been waiting for a while now, so they might be getting annoyed. Just remember to bring them *two* side dishes. Some *Delicious Chicken-Mushroom Skewer* should do the trick.
Smiley Yanxiao: After the sides have been served, ask them what they'd like to have for their main course — save yourself that extra trip.
Smiley Yanxiao: Alright, run along now. Don't keep them waiting.

## Talk 8

Holderlin: We've been here all day, why hasn't anyone come to take our orders yet?

## Talk 9

Holderlin: Well, finally! I was just about to leave...
Traveler: What would you like to order?
Holderlin: I've heard that the people of Liyue make excellent seafood, so I'd like to try some...
Holderlin: But I've been trying the vegetarian lifestyle out recently, so I can't have meat. I wonder if they have something... vegetarian that tastes like seafood...
Caspar: Ever since I tried spicy food at Wanmin Restaurant, I've been completely smitten by that flavor. Nowadays, I can't eat anything if it doesn't have that spice in it.
Caspar: I'll pass on the seafood, I've had too much of it lately. Some fowl would be great.
Caspar: I'm not too familiar with Liyue cuisine, so I'll take whatever you recommend, thanks.

## Talk 10

Smiley Yanxiao: So, what did they order?
Smiley Yanxiao: What would Holderlin like to order?

## Talk 11

Traveler: Vegetarian Abalone.
Smiley Yanxiao: Hmm, that's a tough one. This outlander sure knows how to pick 'em.
Smiley Yanxiao: What would Caspar like to eat?

## Talk 12

Traveler: Vegetarian Abalone.
Smiley Yanxiao: Alright, I've got it.

## Talk 13

Traveler: Golden Shrimp Balls.
Smiley Yanxiao: Alright, I've got it.

## Talk 14

Traveler: Jueyun Chili Chicken.
Smiley Yanxiao: This outlander likes spicy food, does he? Ho, I can do that.

## Talk 15

Smiley Yanxiao: Alright, alright, I've got them down now... Phew, this'll be a busy day and no mistake.
Smiley Yanxiao: Let me see if there's anything we need your help with... Oh yes, we have two servings of takeout here. Could I trouble you to send them out?
Smiley Yanxiao: One serving of Almond Tofu for Aunt Qiao, and a serving of Golden Shrimp Balls for Zhuyu.
Smiley Yanxiao: Having made so many dishes in such a short time, we're starting to run out of ingredients.
Smiley Yanxiao: How about this? While you're on your trip, you bring some ingredients back with you. *Three servings of* *Rice, Almonds, and Tofu* each should do the trick.
Smiley Yanxiao: We really don't have sufficient ingredients on hand right now, so I'll have to trouble you to go out and buy some. You should be able to get all these ingredients from *Second Life*, just report the bill to me afterwards.

## Talk 16

Aunt Qiao: Anything I can do for you, youngster?

## Talk 17

Aunt Qiao: Oh? This is... the delivery from Wangshu Inn?
Aunt Qiao: Oh yes, this is wonderful... A serving of Wangshu Inn's Almond Tofu on a festive occasion is always great.
Aunt Qiao: #Thank you, young man.

## Talk 18

Zhuyu: Qinglian, is there anything else you'd like to eat other than Golden Shrimp Balls?
Qinglian: *cough* Don't worry. Let's wait a while more, the takeout should be here soon.
Zhuyu: Hmm? Do you need anything?

## Talk 19

Zhuyu: Look, Qinglian, look — our takeout's here! Thanks for making the trip.

## Talk 20

Smiley Yanxiao: You've got some smooth moves, don't you? As expected of an adventurer...

## Talk 21

Smiley Yanxiao: What's with that freeloader today...

## Talk 22

Smiley Yanxiao: You've got nimble hands. Thank you, I should be able to send this Xiao Lantern off soon.
Smiley Yanxiao: Ah, yes — make sure you don't forget to pass the other Xiao Lantern to Jiangxue.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Jiangxue: Another year, another Lantern Rite...

### Additional Talk 2

Jiangxue: A Xiao Lantern? Why so sudden...
Traveler: Smiley Yanxiao wanted me to send this to you.
Jiangxue: Ha, that chef is a thoughtful man indeed. He's... changed a great deal since our initial meeting.
Jiangxue: Time slips by, and yet here I am, still unable to wholly let go. How shameful.
Traveler: What can't you let go of?
Jiangxue: Nothing, really. Mere trivial matters that aren't worth any mention. Thanks for coming all this way and sending me that Xiao Lantern.
Jiangxue: I don't have anything to wish for, nor have I released a Xiao Lantern of my own in a long time...
Jiangxue: But having a lantern by my side to look at isn't too bad. Thank you very much.

### Additional Talk 3

Smiley Yanxiao: Why's that girl Yuhua not in the kitchen helping me out...

### Additional Talk 4

Smiley Yanxiao: Taking orders and sending takeout, buying ingredients, serving the food... What else have we got...

### Additional Talk 5

Holderlin: Hope my order arrives soon...
Caspar: I wonder what I'll be served...

### Additional Talk 6

Aunt Qiao: #Thank you, young man.

### Additional Talk 7

Zhuyu: Thanks for coming all this way.

### Additional Talk 8

Smiley Yanxiao: Strange — I wonder why those customers don't look too pleased after their dishes arrived.
Smiley Yanxiao: Did my hand slip somewhere? That can't be...
Smiley Yanxiao: So, are all the other matters settled?
Traveler: I've sent those meals out.
Smiley Yanxiao: Good, good — have you bought the ingredients as well?

### Additional Talk 9

Smiley Yanxiao: Hmm, you were a little slow... *sigh* But there were too many things to do, after all...

### Additional Talk 10

Smiley Yanxiao: Thanks, you've lightened my load a fair bit.
Smiley Yanxiao: Haha, aren't I a busy man... It's the Lantern Rite, and I haven't put a lantern together yet...
Smiley Yanxiao: Ah, right. Traveler, do you know how to make Xiao Lanterns?
Smiley Yanxiao: It doesn't feel right to ask you for help with this as well, but I really can't spare the time to source for materials to make a lantern.
Smiley Yanxiao: If you're willing to help out, could you make me one... No, two — two lanterns?
Smiley Yanxiao: I'll take one of them, and I'd like you to help me send the other to Jiangxue. He can usually be found fishing near the inn.
Smiley Yanxiao: He's usually something of a freeloader, but for some reason, he hasn't come over today...

### Additional Talk 11

Smiley Yanxiao: Come again at night, I need to hurry up and finish making preparations...
