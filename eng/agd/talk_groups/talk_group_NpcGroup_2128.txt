Madame Qin: Traveling without any baggage really is the most relaxing...
Madame Qin: Haha, youngster, you need to work hard while you have your youth, so you can live out your dreams when you're older.

Traveler: Your dreams?
Madame Qin: Of course! When I was young, I dreamed of traveling the world, but then, I wanted to bring everything with me, and it was too much trouble...
Madame Qin: Back then, I still fantasized about obtaining an Anemo Vision. Well, the thought of using the power of Anemo to pull my house along is quite romantic even now...
Madame Qin: But though I didn't manage to obtain a Vision, I eventually woke up to the fact that the best sort of journey is the kind where you bring nothing other than money.
Madame Qin: So my entire lifetime's worth of savings was for this trip. Whatever I lack, I buy directly! *chuckles*
