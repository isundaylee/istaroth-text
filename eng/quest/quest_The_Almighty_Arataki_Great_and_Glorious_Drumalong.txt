# The Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival


## Talk 1

Paimon: Same situation as earlier. The Arataki Gang is nowhere in sight.
Paimon: There should be a Yashiro Commission representative here. Let's go and ask him.

## Talk 2

Kimura: Do you have any other questions?
Kimura: If you want to find the Arataki Gang, try Amakane Island.

## Talk 3

Hirohiko: How can I help?
Traveler: We're looking for the Arataki Gang.
Hirohiko: Ah yes, you must be here for the Almighty Arataki Whatchamacallit Festival, too?
Traveler: "Too"?
Hirohiko: Yep, Madam Kujou Sara of the Tenryou Commission and Yoimiya of Naganohara Fireworks have both been here so far.
Hirohiko: Yoimiya noticed them getting the venue ready when she was here to deliver some fireworks. I guess she got curious and went to go check it out.
Hirohiko: As to what Madam Kujou Sara was here for, I'm not quite sure.
Paimon: #Whoa, so other people got here before us? That's a good sign, Traveler, hehe.
Paimon: So where's the Arataki Gang now?
Hirohiko: Unfortunately, since there's no space available at any official venues at the moment...
Hirohiko: ...we had to allocate them to a tiny beach at the northwest part of the island.
Hirohiko: If only they'd applied earlier, we could've given them a better location.
Hirohiko: Head northwest, you'll see them.

## Talk 4

Arataki Itto: Hahahahaha! Hey there, compadres! You finally made it!
Arataki Itto: I was just wondering when you'd be showing up, next thing I know, boom. There you are. Hahaha, boy, am I happy to see you.
Arataki Itto: Look at this venue. What do you think? Is this a prime location or what?
Mamoru: It's surrounded by sea, the air is as fresh as it gets, there's no noise pollution from the city, and the views are simply spectacular.
Akira: The venue is situated against the backdrop of Amakane Island, where you can enjoy exclusive access to the Festival and Culture Center's first-rate equipment.
Genta: With excellent transport links by sea and lands, getting where you need to be is highly convenient — whether you're traveling by foot or by boat.
Traveler: This venue is pretty nice.
Arataki Itto: The moment I set eyes on this venue, I knew this was the one!
Arataki Itto: It was the moment that changed the world.
Genta: Give it up for the boss!
Paimon: Clearly, you're only here because the Tenryou Commission sent you away.
Arataki Itto: Ahem... alright, let's get down to business.
Arataki Itto: I invited you all here to attend the Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival! A highly important festival, I might add.
Genta: Yeah, Boss said the first goal of the festival is to promote the Arataki Gang and recruit new members.
Mamoru: Secondly, it's to celebrate Shinobu's graduation!
Akira: And last but not least, it makes up for all the previous team building events that were canceled due to insufficient funding.
Paimon: Three festivals in one, wow.
Arataki Itto: Akira... we can leave that last point out from now on.
Traveler: Where is Shinobu?
Arataki Itto: The thing with festivals is, you gotta get out there and promote them far and wide if you want to get a good crowd. So Shinobu's handing out flyers.
Paimon: Hey! Shinobu's supposed to be the star of the show, isn't she?
Paimon: How come she's out there working her butt off while you're hanging around here doing nothing?
Arataki Itto: Hey, I'm hard at work too! I'm, uh... entertaining guests!
Genta: Boss actually just got back.
Mamoru: He said he was expecting you to arrive any second, so he came back specially to welcome you.
Akira: Until then, he was out there with Shinobu working hard to bring more people to the festival.
Arataki Itto: Just—Just doin' my duty. Nothin' more, nothin' less.
Paimon: Wow, this bull-chucker actually did some serious work for once. Paimon's pleasantly surprised.
Arataki Itto: Hmph, trust a puny little flying Lavender Melon to stoop to the level of childish name-calling!
Arataki Itto: Anyway, so, compadre — you got any questions about this festival?
Traveler: You guys are eternal optimists.

## Talk 5

Genta: I'm Genta, the Arataki Drumalong Festival Welcome Ambassador. Are you ready for your Drumalong performance?
Genta: Oh, I almost forgot, there's something that Boss forgot to mention to you about this hand drum.
Genta: Since none of us really know if it's in tune or not, please test it out first.
Genta: That way, it'll sound better when you deliver your final performance.
Genta: Go on, give it a try.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: What's this festival got in store for us?
Arataki Itto: Hahahaha! A ton of totally awesome stuff!
Arataki Itto: See that hill over there? That's Singalong Hill. Stand at the top, look out over the sea, and sing your heart out.
Arataki Itto: And this bonfire, it's perfect for roasting Lavender Melons, the regular kind or the ones of the annoying little floating variety.
Arataki Itto: And these boxes. Plenty of space whether you wanna play Genius Invokation TCG or a-battle some beetles.
Paimon: Wow, you really pulled out all the stops.
Arataki Itto: But of course, the highlight of this festival is the Drumalong. Here, feast your eyes on this.
Arataki Itto: Just between you and me, this little treasure was sourced through a top-secret channel. They said it's a prized hand drum that once belonged to a renowned onmyouji, and it's worth 8 million Mora!
Arataki Itto: Thanks to my strapping good looks and the fact that the vendor and I kinda had a connection — her words, not mine — she gave me a generous discount, and only asked for 800 thousand Mora.
Paimon: She went from 8 million to 800 thousand just like that? Uh... sounds suspiciously like a scam to Paimon.
Arataki Itto: Duh, haha! Oldest trick in the book, right? Which is why it didn't work on me.
Arataki Itto: I spotted the damage on the edge right away. Practically screamed "defective product alert"! "Ooh, we have a connection"... Gimme a break!
Arataki Itto: So I haggled hard and took her down to 80 G's, hahahaha! Practically a steal!
Paimon: Yeah... more specifically, daylight robbery...
Paimon: Still, it's pretty impressive that you could actually afford something worth 80 thousand Mora. Good for you, Bull-Chucker.
Arataki Itto: Pfft, it's only 80 thousand Mora. What do you take me for!
Genta: I put in 20 grand...
Mamoru: Me too...
Akira: Huh? Boss, how come I had to pay 30 grand?
Paimon: 20 grand plus 20 grand plus 30 grand...
Paimon: Ugh, you really are a bull-chucker! You extorted 80 grand from your gang members and didn't pay a single Mora yourself!
Arataki Itto: Ahem, you might wanna check your mathematics there! I paid my share... y'know, I paid the last 10 grand!
Arataki Itto: Alright, good chat, but we should wrap things up. It's getting late, I should go rendezvous with Shinobu.
Arataki Itto: This festival's just getting started. We need to keep plugging it to get a bigger crowd!
Arataki Itto: Take care of the hand drum, alright? Oh, and if you wanna try out the Drumalong at any point, Genta's your guy.
Arataki Itto: Laters, compadre!

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: I heard Kujou Sara came?
Arataki Itto: Oh, you mean that stupid tengu?
Arataki Itto: Yeah, I hesitated, but... I sent her an invitation.
Arataki Itto: I cannot believe how ungrateful she is. Get this — she came all the way out here just to put up a bulletin board and write a load of baloney on it, claiming that visitors need to be cautioned.
Arataki Itto: She even warned us not to change it. It's blatant bullying of the gang, that's what it is...
Arataki Itto: One day, I'm gonna defeat that tengu fair and square, in broad daylight, in the middle of the street! She'll get what's coming to her!
Arataki Itto: Anyway, so, compadre — you got any questions about this festival?

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: I heard Yoimiya showed up, too?
Arataki Itto: The owner of Naganohara Fireworks?
Arataki Itto: Chatting with her is a real blast. She only found out about our festival because she happened to be delivering some fireworks to Amakane Island.
Arataki Itto: She really liked what we're trying to do here, and came to pass on her best wishes. She even said she'll provide some fireworks for us next time.
Arataki Itto: Looks like the Arataki Gang should make sure to keep good ties with Naganohara Fireworks in the future.
Arataki Itto: Anyway, so, compadre — you got any questions about this festival?

### Additional Talk 4

Akira: I'm Akira, the Arataki Drumalong Festival Feedback Ambassador. So, can you give us some feedback?
Traveler: It's pretty good.
Akira: Got it. Thank you for your feedback.
Akira: Hmm? You have other questions? But I don't really have anything else to say.
Akira: Uh... The boss said my only job was to say two things: "Can you give us some feedback?" and "Thank you for your feedback."
Akira: And if the guests ask when they will receive a response to their feedback, I'm supposed to say: "We'll get back to you as soon as possible."
Akira: He said that's what people do in other events he's been to. I'm sure he's basing this on a wealth of experience.
Akira: But then Shinobu told me that's too insincere, so she gave me this notebook.
Akira: Look here, I've made a note of your feedback, and I'll show it to Shinobu when she gets back.
Traveler: It's alright, nothing special.
Traveler: It's not that great.

### Additional Talk 5

Mamoru: I'm Mamoru, the Arataki Drumalong Festival Atmosphere Ambassador. How may I help?
Mamoru: You're asking what my job is?
Mamoru: Well, as the atmosphere ambassador, my job is mainly to create a lively atmosphere and give all attendants the feeling of "I'm so hyped I'm going out of my mind."
Mamoru: Do you feel that way?
Traveler: Not even slightly.
Mamoru: ...Hey, don't say that!
Mamoru: That was really disheartening, it's like being punched in the gut! If that's how you feel... my job's meaningless, isn't it?
Mamoru: You are the boss's friend. Please, show me some support for his sake. I'm begging you, say the line!
Traveler: What line?
Mamoru: You know, "I'm so hyped I'm going out of my mind."
Traveler: I'm so hyped I'm going out of my mind.
Mamoru: Great! Awesome!
Mamoru: This is the best recognition I could ask for!
Mamoru: Come on, people! More music, more dancing, let's keep this party going!
Traveler: I'm so... I'm so... I'm sorry, I just can't.
Mamoru: Ugh... fine. Well, I guess I should at least keep trying, seeing how everyone else in the gang is working hard trying to do their jobs, too...
Mamoru: You can punch me in the gut, but I won't give up! Just like the boss says!
Traveler: Nowhere near.
