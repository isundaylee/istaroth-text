# Friendship in Writing


## Talk 1

Paimon: Alright, Miko, we're here. So, what's your plan of action to deal with this rival book?
Yae Miko: Hmm... Why don't you take a guess?
Yae Miko: I'll give you a hint. It's to do with the Yae Publishing House.
Paimon: Hmmmm... Oh, Paimon knows! Combine the reputation of the Yae Publishing House with the status of Guuji Yae and tell everyone that the incantations in that book are dangerous!
Yae Miko: Ooh, wow! Your first guess, and you got it absolutely...
Yae Miko: ...wrong.
Paimon: Yeah— Aww! ...Wait, seriously? That wasn't it?
Yae Miko: "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits" is the hottest light novel right now. If we did as you suggested, we would effectively be advertising to everyone that the incantations are real.
Yae Miko: In bending over backwards trying to warn everyone about the dangers, all we would accomplish is to create more curious readers ready to try them out. Also, sales for the book would only increase further.
Paimon: Okay, yeah, that would be pretty catastrophic... Oh! How about we confiscate all the copies?
Yae Miko: *sigh* Leaving aside the issue of the enormous manpower and resources such an operation would require, going to such lengths over a light novel would be extremely disruptive to the lives of Inazumans.
Paimon: But that means there's nothing we can do...
Yae Miko: Well I've been thinking...
Yae Miko: I've read "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits." It has many other good qualities besides the incantations alone.
Yae Miko: The book contains many ancient "kaidan" — or tales of the supernatural — and is written in a very engaging way. That is why the book has become so popular.
Yae Miko: I think we're going to have a difficult time trying to rein in its popularity while it's the only work in its league on the market.
Traveler: Wait, so you mean...
Yae Miko: That's right. How do you get rid of the next big thing? You replace it with the next next big thing.
Yae Miko: So what we're going to do is create Inazuma's newest hit novel.
Yae Miko: Smash our rival's sales numbers and win our readers back. That is how Yae Miko wages war!
Yae Miko: Incidentally, this will also be the best way to combat the influence of "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits."
Paimon: Wait, Miko, so you want us to write a novel?
Traveler: Can I really do that?
Yae Miko: Heh, well, becoming an accomplished novelist certainly isn't an overnight process. But let's not forget that I am the chief editor of the Yae Publishing House. I have my ways.
Yae Miko: I did say this is what "we're" going to do. I trust that the word "teamwork" is in your vocabulary.
Yae Miko: Anyway. There's a writers' submission event going on at the moment. Start by talking to readers and finding out what they're into. When you have an idea of what the current trends are, come back and see me.
Yae Miko: I'll be at Uyuu Restaurant — find me there when you're done. I will assemble a team, and we can work while we eat.
Traveler: I've never written a novel before.

## Talk 2

Nakano Shino: The Yae Publishing House has held many writers' submission events to date.
Nakano Shino: The winner gets a huge amount of publicity. It's been the ticket to fame for a lot of authors! If you've got a good idea for a story, you definitely don't want to miss out!

## Talk 3

Tetsuo: I'll be honest. I read light novels for the cheap thrills.
Tetsuo: In most traditional stories, the protagonist usually has this long and drawn out character arc, usually involving a process of separation, loss, and ultimately growth and renewed strength. It reads well, and everything, it's just a little slow-paced for me.
Tetsuo: By contrast, there's this popular light novel at the moment called "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits," where the protagonist is super strong right from the get-go! That's what I mean by cheap thrills: action-packed right from page one.
Tetsuo: The protagonist is a kitsune who has not only mastered the secret art of incantations, but also tea ceremony, painting, and calligraphy!

## Talk 4

Black Screen Text: Yae Miko brings the completed light novel...
Nakano Shino: Are you sure you'd like to submit this entry? Let me see, "The Miraculous Adventures of the Traveler," by "Thousand Hands."
Paimon: What a strange pen name... Definitely your doing. Having been around you so much recently, Paimon's slowly starting to understand your unique tastes.
Yae Miko: What do you mean, "strange"? It took a lot of work by a lot of different people to get this thing finished. Don't you think it's a very descriptive pen name?
Nakano Shino: We'll get this printed as a matter of priority and conduct trial sales in pilot locations throughout Inazuma. I'll announce the sales numbers in three days.
Paimon: #Uh-oh, Paimon's getting a little nervous now. D'you really think this is gonna work, Traveler?
Traveler: We had a top-notch team.
Yae Miko: That's right, be confident in your work. That's exactly how a light novelist should be.
Nakano Shino: Okay, then I'll sign you up. Please come back in three days for the results.
Nakano Shino: Thank you all for your submission. I wish you the very best of luck!
Traveler: We're all professionals.

## Talk 5

Yae Miko: How did it go? What did you learn?
Traveler: We learned a couple of things...
Black Screen Text: You tell Yae Miko the readers' thoughts.
Yae Miko: All very true. An original core concept, a fast pace, quality illustrations, and lots of action. This is the formula that will guarantee good sales numbers.
Yae Miko: It's getting late. Let's go to Uyuu Restaurant and write as we eat.

## Talk 6

Nakano Shino: After "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits" took off, a whole host of copycat works appeared on the market. But they were such low quality that no one paid them any attention.
Nakano Shino: It just goes to show that you should write to your own interests. If you just try and imitate someone else, you'll lose your way.

## Talk 7

Yae Miko: Let me think... What spell does Lady Kitsune teach to the protagonist? ...Ah, I've got it!
Yae Miko: Hee-hee, I've got to make sure it sounds suitably mysterious...

## Talk 8

Yae Miko: Ah, there you are. Let me introduce the team:
Yae Miko: You've already met Junkichi and Shigeru.
Yae Miko: Shigeru is an experienced editor and Junkichi is the author he's partnered with. Junkichi's working through a creative lull at the moment, but all his past works have been very popular with young people. He has developed a distinct and enduringly popular style.
Yae Miko: Satomi is Yae Publishing House's ace in the hole. Her specialty is that she can write all kinds of completely different stories, and all under different pen names. As for what those names are, well, that's a trade secret.
Yae Miko: They will be teaming up with us to collectively create the novel that knocks "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits" off its perch. So? Feeling better about my plan now?
Paimon: Uh-huh, it definitely makes sense! Hehe.
Yae Miko: Now then, tell me what you found out about readers' preferences.
Black Screen Text: You tell Yae Miko the readers' thoughts.
Yae Miko: All very true. An original core concept, a fast pace, quality illustrations, and lots of action. This is the formula that will guarantee good sales numbers.
Yae Miko: More importantly than that, even though it's a work of fiction, we have to deliver a sense of realism.
Paimon: Paimon followed pretty much all of that, but there's still one question... what are we actually gonna write about?
Paimon: For example, we know we need an original core concept... but how do we come up with one?
Yae Miko: Hehe... Before you can answer that question, you have to understand your target audience.
Yae Miko: Take "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits," for example. When I read it, all I find is common knowledge to the kitsune. But to the general public, it's bursting with new and interesting ideas. It all comes down to the size of the information gap between author and reader.
Yae Miko: As a Traveler, there must be a great many things you know about that are complete unknowns to the people of Inazuma. What is commonplace to you may be fresh and original to them.
Paimon: Ohh, right! So maybe we can take inspiration from our time in Mondstadt and Liyue!
Paimon: Hmm, but that would make it a completely different genre than "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits"... Uh, is that gonna be a problem?
Yae Miko: Not at all. You don't have to worry so much about how to compete with that book. All you have to do is provide some interesting ideas based on your travel experiences.
Yae Miko: As long as the core content is interesting, my expert team here will be able to flesh out the details.
Paimon: #Alright! Let's start with chapter one, then. Uh... what are you thinking, Traveler?
Traveler: "Reincarnated in Another World: Encounters with Airborne Emergency Rations"
Paimon: No! No one would ever go for that, no matter how you tried to play it!
Yae Miko: Hmm... Out of a maximum of 10 points, I'd give that a 9!
Yae Miko: Is there really flying emergency food in other worlds? How does it taste? And how do you cook it?
Yae Miko: It's a strong opening — an easy way to grab the readers' attention. Never underestimate the appeal of culinary-oriented subject matter. Food, after all, is a topic that everyone is interested in.
Paimon: Hey!
Yae Miko: Good job, little one. You're not only drawing on your own experiences, but it seems you're filtering them through the lens of the kinds of light novels you've read in the past. I think you really understand what we're trying to do here.
Yae Miko: Thoughts from the experts? Are we able to work with this general framework to make an interesting story?
Junkichi: Yeah, we think it works. I tend to overcomplicate the core concept if I'm not careful, so this deals with that problem.
Yae Miko: Hehe. That's good.
Yae Miko: Okay, we're done with chapter one. Let's move on to chapter two.
Paimon: Huh? Won't that do for now?
Yae Miko: Readers will devour your content a lot more quickly than you'd think. If we don't keep delivering the goods now we've caught their attention, all our hard work so far is in vain.
Yae Miko: Hurry, chapter two, let's go. Can't you see that Satomi is waiting?
Paimon: #Hmm? What's wrong with you, Traveler? You don't look so good...
Traveler: I can't think of any more stories...
Yae Miko: What a pity... I thought your "beginner's luck" would carry you a little further before it came to this. But alas. The time has come prematurely.
Paimon: Before it came to what? What's happened?
Yae Miko: The bane of our existence: "writer's block." It's your arch-nemesis for life, appearing without warning and inflicting a pain worse than death upon the writer. They sell their souls just to get their muse back.
Paimon: Sounds awful.
Yae Miko: When this happens, the best thing you can do is have a bite to eat and take a proper break.
Yae Miko: Boss, get me a plate of Fried Tofu! And get some Kushikatsu for these two. Just the basic kind will do.
Yae Miko: Don't worry, this is my treat.
Paimon: Your treat? Oh, wait a minute. Miko, we'll be getting paid for all the hard work we're doing, right?
Yae Miko: Of course, everyone that takes part in the creative process will be paid.
Paimon: #Alright, cool! Then let's press on, shall we, Traveler? Don't give up now! For the sake of our paycheck, get your brain going!
Traveler: Paycheck... hmm, speaking of "Mora"...
Paimon: Ooh, ooh! Does this mean your inspiration's come back?
Traveler: "Took a Trip to Liyue, Tour Guide Turned Out to Be Rex Lapis"
Paimon: Let's see now... "The protagonist arrives in Liyue and befriends a young man who doesn't have the money to pay for anything. Only later do we find out that this young man is none other than Rex Lapis himself."
Paimon: "With the help of the Qixing and the protection of the adepti, I am free to roam this vast realm..."
Paimon: Hmm, is this the kind of "cheap thrill" that that guy was talking about?
Yae Miko: Hmm... I give it a 9.8!
Yae Miko: The story is fun and action-packed, with no dark undertones. Also, there are a great many legends about Rex Lapis. I'm sure it will spark the people's curiosity.
Yae Miko: I, for one, think there's a sizable market for this. Approved.
Paimon: Alright, well... let's just hope Zhongli doesn't mind.
Yae Miko: Great, well, now Satomi can get started on that.
Satomi: Leave it to me, Lady Yae.
Yae Miko: Let's write about Inazuma in the third chapter, shall we? I can help with this one. We can use the Vision Hunt Decree or your experience in the resistance, any ideas?
Traveler: "Stuff This! C'mon, Let's Get Rid of This Vision Hunt Decree!"
Yae Miko: Mm, clearly very closely based on your own personal experience, with no major changes at all.
Traveler: Well, I'm running low on inspiration...
Yae Miko: That's fine. Since it's something that took place in Inazuma, it might actually be more interesting to readers if it's grounded in the truth.
Yae Miko: One thing though — we'll need to rewrite the part about me giving you the omamori.
Yae Miko: Let's change it to: "The mysterious Lady Kitsune teaches the protagonist a spell that can make their wishes come true. The protagonist uses this spell to defeat the Raiden Shogun in battle." That should do the trick.
Paimon: Whoa, so we're really going head-to-head with our rival on this one, huh?
Yae Miko: Hehe, I suppose so. Once they're done writing the manuscript, I'll write the passage where the protagonist recites the incantation myself.
Paimon: Are we done, then? Do you really think this will be able to beat "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits"?
Yae Miko: The content is fine. Now we just need to promote it.
Yae Miko: I will contact an artist to make some illustrations — I'm positive they will be at least as good as those in "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits." We'll also need an endorsement on a paper band around the book. I can get the wonderful Ms. Hina to write that.
Yae Miko: She runs a regular Q&A column in "That's Life" magazine. The people of Inazuma absolutely adore her.
Yae Miko: You're free to take a break while the creative team is doing their work, but please go by the Yae Publishing House at some point to commission Ms. Hina for that recommendation. Once our light novel is complete, let's meet at the writers' submission event.
Traveler: "Farewell, Literature Hunt Decree!"
Paimon: "The strict Principal Raiden of the Inazuma Academy decided to confiscate all light novels."
Paimon: "With the help of Lady Kitsune, the protagonist defeats Principal Raiden in an exam before the throne, forcing the principal to abolish the Literature Hunt Decree..."
Paimon: Are we absolutely sure we can publish this...?
Yae Miko: We can and we will! I think it's great!
Traveler: "Starting as a Resistance Soldier"
Paimon: "When the Vision Hunt Decree comes out of nowhere, the protagonist joins the resistance, starting out as an ordinary rank-and-file soldier."
Paimon: "Find out how the protagonist goes on to make great contributions to the war effort, become best friends with the resistance general, and get to know the Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine, working together with everyone to finally secure a grand victory for the resistance..."
Paimon: Huh, it's... surprisingly normal...
Yae Miko: I think it's rather good. A lot of people still like the classic hero's journey. From ordinary soldier to great leader — a fresh take on a timeless classic.
Traveler: "Rock 'N' Roll Girl!!!"
Paimon: "The Liyue Academy has more student clubs than you can shake a stick at, and as the new kid on the block, the protagonist is the one they're all fighting over..."
Paimon: "There's the Culinary Club, the Architecture Club, the Funerary Club, even the Coconut Milk Research Club... But in the end, the protagonist chose to join the Rock 'N' Roll Club."
Paimon: "Taking a chance on their youthful dreams, four newcomers to the academy form a rock 'n' roll band that really begins to take off!"
Paimon: Paimon loves it!
Yae Miko: Hmm... I give it a 9.5!
Yae Miko: A classic tale of youth and friendship. It never gets old.
Yae Miko: I especially like the head of the club. Great character design. She really has rock 'n' roll coursing through her veins. I can almost feel the heat from that fire in her soul. Approved!
Paimon: Aw, yeah!
Traveler: "I Turned Into a Geovishap Hatchling!"
Paimon: "The protagonist awakes to find themselves turned into a Geovishap Hatchling surrounded by countless adventurers."
Paimon: "But then, the protagonist suddenly discovers that they have a special ability: keep rolling to keep evolving..."
Paimon: "So the protagonist rolled and rolled and rolled, hoping to evolve into the strongest Geo creature ever!"
Paimon: So the protagonist is no longer a human, huh? Good luck retconning that after chapter one!
Yae Miko: Hmm... I give it a 9.5!
Yae Miko: "Monster evolution" is an increasingly common theme these days. What started out as a rather niche genre has gradually worked its way into the mainstream.
Yae Miko: And I wouldn't worry about the continuity issue. All we have to do is explain at the beginning of the work that the protagonist can travel between different worlds. Or just explain it away as a dream.
Paimon: Ugh, no integrity whatsoever!
Yae Miko: Hehe... The most important thing is that it's fun. In light novels, as in life, having fun is the most important thing. Wouldn't you agree?
Paimon: Hmm. You do kinda have a point...
Traveler: My mind's gone blank...
Traveler: "The Work-Shy Bard"
Paimon: Let's see what you've got... "After enrolling in the Mondstadt Academy, I found out that the young man sitting next to me in class was a total slacker."
Paimon: "He said he was a bard, had a habit of playing his lyre in class, and always had a bottle of liquor on his person. But his true identity was actually the principal of the academy..."
Paimon: What kind of plot is that!?
Yae Miko: Hmm... Out of a maximum of 10 points, I'd give that a 9.5!
Yae Miko: It just goes to show, you have to have an interesting character sitting in the back row by the window.
Yae Miko: The protagonist is a transfer student, new to the school, whose ordinary life is about to take a wild turn when they meet the ballad-and-alcohol-loving principal. Sounds interesting. Approved!
Paimon: Paimon just does not see the appeal...
Traveler: "The Dragon and the Grand Adventure"
Paimon: This sounds like a great one!
Paimon: Let's see here... "The protagonist arrives in Mondstadt for the first time to the sight of a dragon flying around and wreaking havoc on the city."
Paimon: "With the help of some trusty companions, the protagonist successfully defeats the dragon. But then... the dragon suddenly turns into a beautiful young woman..." ...Huh?
Paimon: "Human, let us work together to build a better future! The love story between human and dragon begins today..."
Paimon: Well that was an unexpected development. What happened to the grand adventure!?
Traveler: "The Grand Adventure" is just the protagonist's name.
Paimon: What!? But that's so misleading!
Yae Miko: Hmm... Out of a maximum of 10 points, I'd give that a 9!
Yae Miko: The story certainly goes in an unorthodox direction. And the dragon-girl sounds destined to be a hit character. Approved!
Paimon: What the heck!

## Talk 9

Black Screen Text: You tell Kuroda about the situation...
Kuroda: Ms. Hina doesn't usually do endorsements. But since it's Lady Guuji that's asking, we'll see what we can do.
Kuroda: With Ms. Hina getting so popular lately, a lot of people have come to us hoping to do a collaboration.
Kuroda: But Ms. Hina's not interested in any of it. She still prefers to focus all her efforts on replying to readers' letters, and turns down every promotional opportunity she can.
Kuroda: Maybe that's why her fans like her so much... Ahem, I'm getting off topic here. Anyway, if we can get that endorsement from Ms. Hina, you'll definitely get an exposure boost at the beginning.
Kuroda: May your light novel sell well, and set a new record for the Yae Publishing House!
Paimon: We'll do our best!

## Talk 10

Kyouta: I've been reading light novels for long time now. I'm mainly into big, ambitious fantasy works with an original core concept and good storytelling.
Kyouta: These days, though, everyone seems to be imitating each other. Most of the time I can guess what the story is about just from the title.
Kyouta: The only recent book worth mentioning is "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits."
Kyouta: Not only is it a good story, but the descriptions are really true to life. So much so that I'm almost wondering if maybe the author really has met all those youkai before.

## Talk 11

Nakano Shino: Ah, you've all finally made it.
Nakano Shino: Good news, everyone. I just received word that your light novel is flying off the shelves! Multiple sales locations are asking when we'll be printing more copies.
Paimon: Woohoo, that's great!
Nakano Shino: This level of success is an amazing accomplishment for a new work. Most new books don't sell 30% of what you've sold.
Nakano Shino: I have free copies for each of you here, please take them. The payment will follow shortly, and I'll notify you to come and collect it when the time comes.
Traveler: This is all great, but...
Paimon: Oh, yeah! The whole reason why we made this light novel was to combat the influence of "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits."
Paimon: Hmm, we sold a lot of copies, but it doesn't feel like we accomplished our goal. How do we know whether it worked?
Yae Miko: Hehe... Oh, don't worry. The change is already underway.
Yae Miko: Shh... listen to what the people around us are talking about. The conversation has already moved on, hasn't it?
Kazumichi: Hey guys... have you heard about this latest kaidan thing doing the rounds? You just need to recite the incantation from "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits" at midnight, and your wish will come true...
Kyouta: Oh, that? Heh, that's a throwback. That's old news, man.
Kyouta: No one's talking about that anymore. "The Secret Spells of Lady Kitsune" is the new hit thing. I've already memorized all the incantations.
Kazumichi: "The Secret Spells of Lady Kitsune"? What's that?
Tetsuo: You haven't read it yet? Okay, so, supposedly, if you recite the spell in there on a moonless night, you'll receive the protection of the kitsune and all the other powerful youkai. They can make any of your wishes come true!
Tetsuo: I heard that the incantations in "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits" have weird side effects! This one guy wished for a load of Mora — and got it — but then one night, it all turned to leaves and he developed a high fever.
Tetsuo: They actually had to use one of "The Secret Spells of Lady Kitsune" to get rid of the discomfort.
Tetsuo: That proves that the incantations in this book are more potent than the ones everyone was trying before! Pretty much everyone I know is desperate to try it out — just waiting for a moonless night.
Kazumichi: Really? Well I'd better go and prepare, too...
Yae Miko: Well? Feeling less worried now?
Paimon: Wow, you're right. Everyone's shifting focus!
Paimon: But what's this "moonless night" that they're talking about?
Paimon: Paimon doesn't remember that detail from the brainstorming session.
Yae Miko: Hehe, this is something that will become very important to us further down the line. Alright, it's time to move on to the next phase of the plan.
Paimon: Eh? There's a phase two?
Yae Miko: Of course. Behind every book that hits the market lies an author, right?
Paimon: Ohh, yeah! If we leave him to his own devices, he might just write another guide to summoning spirits.
Paimon: ...Also, we still need to figure out what his motive for writing it was!
Yae Miko: Exactly, that's what we need to take care of next. Fortunately, I've already managed to identify the author — he's a failed light novelist named Tomoyuki.
Yae Miko: But when we went to ask him about it, he had no recollection whatsoever of having written the book.
Traveler: Wait, so does this mean...
Yae Miko: Yes, this is another case of possession — only this time, whoever possessed him actively sought him out.
Yae Miko: After his novel submission failed, he was walking aimlessly in Araumi. In frustration, he shouted out: "Please, someone, anyone! Help me write a truly amazing novel!" After that, he lost consciousness.
Paimon: But the spirit that wrote the book has already left him now, right? So what are we supposed to do?
Yae Miko: Simple. It wrote a summoning incantation in the book, didn't it? So we can just use its own method to make it manifest itself.
Yae Miko: And you, my little friend, are the perfect candidate for this role. Hehehe...
Traveler: This sounds very dubious.
Yae Miko: Aww, what are you talking about? The fun's just about to begin.
Traveler: Is it too late for me to back out?

## Talk 12

Oosuke: The key to a successful light novel is having good illustrations.
Oosuke: When to use illustrations, what they should contain, and which artist you should commission for them... These are all key things to bear in mind.
Oosuke: Good illustrations can make up for bad writing. But on the flip side, a bad illustration can ruin your novel, even if you have the best story in the world.
Oosuke: There's a saying that light novels are essentially a case of "buy art, get words free." I'd agree with that. Too bad most of the top artists have jam-packed schedules, so it's extremely difficult to commission them...
Oosuke: The illustrations in "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits" are incredible, but it's unlike any art style I've ever seen before.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Kyouta: I don't usually like the kaidan genre, but "The Secret Spells of Lady Kitsune" is an exception.
Kyouta: I'm definitely going to give it a try as soon as we have a moonless night. Here's hoping Lady Kitsune will make my wishes come true...

### Additional Talk 2

Oosuke: I bought three copies of this light novel. One to read, one for my collection, and another one to lend out to my friends.
Oosuke: It's worth the price just for the gorgeous illustrations alone!

### Additional Talk 3

Tetsuo: Honestly, it's a really gripping story. I'm still feeling pumped up!
Tetsuo: I hope the next volume comes out soon... Wait, when is it coming out, actually? Aw man, I hope it won't be a really long wait...

### Additional Talk 4

Nakano Shino: Wow... I never expected this submission event would uncover such talented authors.
Nakano Shino: To make sure you can all deliver your best work, we should fix an issue date for the next volume now.

### Additional Talk 5

Shigeru: Don't worry, this story has a very clear narrative structure. Junkichi will definitely be able to work his magic on the writing front.
Paimon: Oh yeah, how did it go with that incantation from "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits"? Did you manage to make a wish in the end?
Shigeru: Nope! On the first day, Junkichi couldn't memorize the incantation, because it was too long. On the second day, he didn't wake up in time, and midnight came and went. Then, on the third day—
Junkichi: Mr. Shigeru, I thought we agreed not to speak of this?

### Additional Talk 6

Satomi: Hmm... add a little foreshadowing here... callback to the first chapter there — callback via contrast, that is... plot twist here, obviously. Now, where's the best to explore the central theme...
Paimon: Wow, she seems really in the zone. Let's not disturb her.

### Additional Talk 7

Kyouta: Have you made a submission? Wow, you turned that around pretty quickly! Seems like I'm in for a treat soon, haha!

### Additional Talk 8

Oosuke: I'm not buying it unless the illustrations are good.

### Additional Talk 9

Tetsuo: I've finished "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits" now. I wonder if I'll be able to find another one as good as that?
Tetsuo: If I can't find anything else to my liking, I guess I'll just have to read "A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits" again.

### Additional Talk 10

Kuroda: Lady Guuji has an eye for things like this. If she thinks your work is interesting, you can be sure it's destined for success.
