Marchosius, God of the Stove, born from a spark when stone struck stone
He was a god with a great love for humanity
And their well-being
Millennia ago, the people sought to expand their city
They built a dwelling on the plains and called it the Guili Assembly
The Stove God cared greatly for the people
Turning himself into minions who went into every home, fostering food and solidarity alike
Alas, their home was taken by a flood
The waters ravaged the Guili Assembly
And forced the people back south, to Liyue Harbor
Though the distance was not far, the journey was plagued by a terrible storm
For a dozen days the adepti stayed by their side
During this time, the Stove God cooked an ancient delicacy
Flatbread with a meat sauce to stave off the cold and damp, fit for those on the move
Centuries later, disaster and plague arose once more
The Stove God would appear no longer
For he placed all of his power into the land itself
To quell the calamities
His power expended, and his wits greatly reduced
Thus, his body decreased in size
By the time he parted ways with us, he wasn't even the height of a human
He told Rex Lapis and I of the dishes that bring joy and of the secrets of the flame
Then went into the mountains
And entered into a long slumber
The Stove God departed and Guoba was born
When he awoke, he ate the Chili-Mince Cornbread Buns
Placed on the offering table by a young lady in yellow
Though he did not remember the past, he was profoundly moved
And decided to follow this young lady thereafter
The Stove God had quietly disappeared
But the vendors rose early to hawk their wares
People went out to buy goods, lit their stoves and cooked food
Just as they had done every day for as long as they could remember
In Liyue, things have always been this way
Nature provides, the mountains rejoice, we are blessed by heaven's good grace
Years have gone by, the world has transformed, but our way of life survives
Fame and fortune, is only a season, it is the moment that we should embrace
