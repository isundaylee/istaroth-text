# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to chat?
Lyney: Sure thing! Say, why don't you take a look at my hat? Do you see anything different about it?
Traveler: Huh... Don't think there's any difference.
Lyney: Ah, but that just means you need to look at it more carefully! Just come a bit closer.
Traveler: Well, alright then.
Lyney: So, do you have the answer? Is it the pattern, or the color? You should have seen this hat many times before.
Traveler: ...Nope, still not seeing it.
Lyney: *sigh* What a pity... Although, your conclusion is actually correct.
Lyney: I just played a little trick, and stole something of yours. And after that, I also slipped a card into your bag.
Lyney: Now, can you guess what I stole from you?
Traveler: My wallet?
Lyney: Haha, I really am quite the little thief with a nose for Mora! No wonder my pockets are always overflowing.
Lyney: What I actually stole, however, was your "attention." That's something far more valuable than Mora!
Lyney: As long as you understand and master this trick, and put some time into practicing movement, you, too, can become an outstanding magician.
Lyney: ...Okay, you can return my card to me now.
Traveler: My heart?
Lyney: A most unexpected answer! I have to say, even my heart has begun to race too.
Lyney: What I actually stole, however, was your "attention." Even though it's not nearly as valuable as your heart, it's still very important to us magicians nonetheless!
Traveler: My... attention?
Lyney: Bingo! Congratulations, that was the right answer.
Traveler: Is it bigger or smaller than before?
Lyney: No, the whole thing was misdirection.
