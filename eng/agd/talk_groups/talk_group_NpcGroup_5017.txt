Traveler: What else can you do?
Potier: I act, I do opera, I play the lyre... I can even do some magic.
Potier: I am an artist, after all — I can do a little bit of everything.
Potier: Ah, if only the day would come when I can perform at the opera house — uh, not in the sense of standing trial, though.

Traveler: You do this business by night?
Potier: Of course! Don't people usually realize that they've forgotten to bring their keys only upon returning home at night?
Potier: Ah, wait, I get it — you're wondering if I'm doing something terrible here, are you?
Potier: Don't worry, don't worry. I have principles and sense — and more importantly, I don't want to perform a "trial-standing show" at the opera house.

Traveler: You seem a little familiar...
Potier: Oh, uh, you must've seen me playing the lyre on the streets during the day.
Potier: "The waters gleam, the fish they leap~" Ring a bell?
Potier: Now, I know what you're thinking. "How does this person know how to do everything?"
Potier: Hehe, it never hurts to learn new skills, you know? Just little tricks for a little profit — and every little is a gain.
