# Kamla's Berries


## Talk 1

Traveler: About the Berries...
Kamla: You must have seen my post and came here to deliver the Berries, right?
Kamla: So, did you get fifteen Berries?
Traveler: Here are the berries you wanted.
Traveler: Not yet.
Kamla: When you're ready, then. I need dry fruit and no one would dry them one at a time, after all.

## Talk 2

Kamla: I'll take them back to dry. Then I'll have dried berries again for my next trip to the sea.
