Traveler: Can you solve any problem?
Tetreaux: Theoretically, I do not believe there is any problem that can only be solved by force.
Tetreaux: When we of the Spina di Rosula act, I'm certain that we'll be able to resolve your issue with minimal harm.
Tetreaux: From things as small as living supplies and household affairs, to matters as large as factional disputes and savings... the Spina will do all it can for you.
