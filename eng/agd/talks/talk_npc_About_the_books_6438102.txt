# Talk Dialog

Traveler: About the books...
Sanad: My roommate recommended these books to me.
Sanad: I asked for some advice on research, and his answer was that we can't only rely on the Akasha.
Sanad: He said that to carry out in-depth research, it's best to track down the source of knowledge, read carefully, and also think proactively.
Sanad: I said: "Sure! Lemme try your method!" He's the best among us, after all â€” we've almost given up on trying to catch up with him, you know.
Sanad: But I really didn't expect him to read... so many books every day...
