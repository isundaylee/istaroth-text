Kaji: Hey, Traveler. How've you been?

## Talk

Traveler: Not bad.
Kaji: That's great!
Kaji: Just as I always say, the days will definitely get better.
Kaji: The Shogun's Army treats us pretty well... It's just that we workers used to be in charge in the mines. Here, we need to listen to the soldiers.
Kaji: It's not all bad, though. At least we have a place to stay. We just have to wait out the war...

## Talk

Traveler: Same old, same old...
Kaji: I see...
Kaji: Keep your chin up! Everyone's trying to get through this. Great things are definitely waiting at the end of it all!
Kaji: Though the soldiers are always telling us to do this and that... at least the Tatarigami are no longer a threat, right? That means we're getting closer to finding peace!
Kaji: Hang in there! Things will get better!

## Talk

Traveler: So, who's getting the credit?
Kaji: Ha! You think the Shogunate would believe that the two of us took care of the Tatarigami by ourselves?
Kaji: All they'll do is credit this whole thing to Her Excellency and sing songs about it in Tenshukaku...
Kaji: I'm just a worker seeking refuge with them. None of that credit's shining down on me, I'll tell you that much.
Kaji: Oh well, it's not like I care about it anyway. We workers from the mines just see it as helping others. Them city folks wouldn't understand.

## Talk

Traveler: Keep up the good work, then.
Kaji: I will, take care!

Kaji: Hey, Traveler. How've you been?

## Talk

Traveler: Not bad.
Kaji: That's great!
Kaji: What did I tell you? The days would definitely get better!
Kaji: Kujou Masahito said that the rebuilding of Yashiori Island has begun. We're going home soon!
Kaji: *sigh* Though we don't know how long peace can last this time around, the thought of being able to go home still gets me all teary-eyed...

## Talk

Traveler: Same old, same old...
Kaji: I see...
Kaji: Keep your spirits up! Good things will eventually come around!
Kaji: The Shogunate and the rebels signed a peace treaty! That means that there's a chance that the mines will return to normal.
Kaji: Though the ceasefire is a good thing, I can't help but think of the victims in Higi Village...
Kaji: I wonder how long it'll take for that place to recover...

Kaji: All they'll do is credit this whole thing to Her Excellency and sing songs about it in Tenshukaku...
Kaji: Well, whatever the case, as long as the war's over, anything goes! Let's not talk about that anymore!
Kaji: Not like I care about it anyway. Us workers from the mines just see it as helping others. Them city people wouldn't get it.

Traveler: You keep up the good work too, then.
Kaji: I will, take care!
