# Tending to a Tepetlisaurus: In Need of a Trim


## Talk 1

Cazcal: Don't go running off again this time, alright, Hora?
Hora: R—Roar...
Traveler: Hora's been such a good boy today!
Cazcal: Hasn't he just? All thanks to that Driftyball you helped me make!
Cazcal: I'll be able to get Hora to do all sorts of things with this ball, whether it's washing, eating, sleeping, or training... Everything'll be so much easier from here on in.
Cazcal: Not to mention trimming his claws! Before, even just chasing him down was enough to exhaust me...
Cazcal: Now, all I have to do is show him this ball, and he'll sit down like he's been house-trained.
Hora: Rrroo, rroo...
Cazcal: #Hora, do you remember who this is? He's the one who helped make your toy!
Hora: Orrooo, orrooo!
Traveler: Who's a good boy?
Cazcal: Oh wow, Hora definitely remembers you! And he's happy to see you, too!
Cazcal: Do you want to try trimming his claws? You can wipe his horn down while you're at it.
Cazcal: This is very important for little Tepetlisaurs. After all, they have to be able to dig through rocks and earth, so their claws need to be kept nice and sharp, with any broken or wonky ones trimmed back into shape.
Cazcal: It's the only way to guarantee that they'll have a pair of perfect claws when they turn into adults...
Cazcal: Here, take this! If we're doing some trimming anyway, we might as well take this chance to give Hora a full-body makeover!
Traveler: That's quite a lot of detail...
Hora: Roar, roar—
Cazcal: *cough* Well, Hora's rarely this well-behaved. It just occurred to me that I won't need to chase him around the entire tribe today, so I couldn't help feeling happy...
Traveler: ...That sounds like a tough job.
Cazcal: It's nothing! Anyway, we'd better get started. I'll be right by your side telling you what to do.
Cazcal: To help Hora relax, you'll need to gently clean his back with the big brush...
Cazcal: Then switch to a finer brush to clean his horn. Put your back into that one, or you'll miss some of the dirt clogging them cracks.
Cazcal: After that, you'll need to use a towel to wipe his entire body down... That way, he'll gradually start to relax and extend his claws, and then you'll be able to give them a trim.
Traveler: That's quite a specific routine.
Cazcal: That goes without saying! I raised Hora myself, after all. There's no one else in the entire tribe... actually, make that the whole of Natlan, who knows him better than I do.
Cazcal: Alright, just follow the instructions I just gave and help give Hora's claws a trim. I'll be right next to you, so just ask if there's anything you're unclear about.
Traveler: You really know him well, huh...
Traveler: Why the sudden wave of excitement?
Traveler: (Pet Hora.)

Hora: (Hora gradually relaxes. He stretches out his whole body and extends his claws. Looks like it's time to give them a trim.)
Black Screen Text: Under Cazcal's guidance, you carefully trim Hora's claws.
Cazcal: Hahaha, I never expected you'd be so good at this!
Hora: Roarrr, roarrr, roar—
Cazcal: Hora's thanking you too. You did such a careful job, I've no doubt he'll be drilling away even faster than before.
Cazcal: Here, take these as a token of my appreciation. Oh yes, and I should probably warn you... If you ever have to look after any other little Saurians in future, whatever you do, don't just copy the method I taught you today.
Cazcal: Each little Saurian has its own unique temperament, so you have to look after them in different ways. Even after all this time, I've still only figured out how to take care of Hora.
Cazcal: Still, I'm just glad that I've even gotten that far. After all, the two of us will have to put up with one another for a long while yet...
Cazcal: Huh? Where's Hora? Don't tell me he's run off again...!
Cazcal: Hora! Horaaaaaaaa—

### Additional Talk 21

Cazcal (Hora): (Hora doesn't seem to find it relaxing at all, and just stares back at you in confusion.)
Black Screen Text: (Cazcal takes over before things deteriorate any further. After another stint of careful grooming, he finally manages to finish trimming Hora's claws...)
Cazcal: It's okay, I misread Hora sometimes too. The important thing is, I'm sure he knows that you're a good friend of his.
Hora: Wroo, rrooh!
Cazcal: Hahaha! See, what did I tell you?
Cazcal: Thanks so much for your help. Please, take these for your trouble.
Cazcal: Little Saurians really are hard nuts to crack. It took me a long time getting to know Hora before I could figure out most of what he was thinking.
Cazcal: I'm just glad I managed to get that far. After all, the two of us will have to put up with one another for a while yet...
Cazcal: Huh? Where's Hora? Don't tell me he's run off again...!
Cazcal: Hora! Horaaaaaaaa—

Hora: (Hora tilts his head, scratches his belly, before looking at you in confusion.)
Cazcal: You can't be playing with Hora the whole time, y'know? Gotta move onto the real business sometime.
Cazcal: *cough* Allow me, alright? I'll demonstrate the proper way to go about this.
Hora: (Cazcal takes over before things deteriorate any further. After another stint of careful grooming, he finally manages to finish trimming Hora's claws...)
Cazcal: Now then, don't focus solely on playing with Hora. You've got a job to do, don't you?
Hora: Hroo! Wrrooo!
Cazcal: Hahaha, looks like Hora does like you though. No wonder he was so obedient this time.
Cazcal: In any case, thanks so much for your help. Please, take these for your trouble.
Cazcal: Hmm... Perhaps I should play with Hora as much as I can before starting the wash...
Cazcal: So, what do you think, Hora?
Cazcal: Huh? Where's Hora? Don't tell me he's run off again...!
Cazcal: Hora! Horaaaaaaaa—
