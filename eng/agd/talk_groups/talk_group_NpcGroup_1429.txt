Grace: Thanks be to the Anemo Archon...
Traveler: What are you up to?
Grace: I'm praying to Lord Barbatos. It was by his protection that Mondstadt was able to weather this storm.
Grace: We also have him to thank for the safety of the Knights of Favonius and the adventurers of the Guild.
Grace: Thank you, Lord Barbatos...
Traveler: Thank you, Lord Barbatos...
Grace: I dare not fathom the things Lord Barbatos has done for us.
Grace: But just knowing that such a diligent deity watches over Mondstadt sets my heart at ease.
Grace: Ah, yes. If you have some time, could you do me a favor?
Grace: I'd like you to help me collect one batch of Dandelion Seeds, and scatter them to the winds at the top of the Anemo Archon Statue...
Traveler: ...How hardworking of him.

Traveler: Are Dandelion Seeds all you need?

Traveler: About those unsettling omens I keep seeing...
Grace: No matter what the cause may be, all we can do is pray.
Grace: I had some adventurers help me collect some Cecilia buds to give everyone...
Grace: These flowers grow on top of cliffs, whisked by the Mondstadt winds...
Grace: Perhaps these flowers that emanate the essence of Barbatos can bring some peace of mind to everyone.
Grace: Here, please take some. May Barbatos shine upon Mondstadt.

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Grace: Lord Barbatos has indeed heard our prayers. Mondstadt is safe once again.
Grace: Although I say that it is over, Dvalin's influence will likely remain for a while longer...
Grace: But I believe that as long as the winds of Mondstadt persist, Lord Barbatos will always be with us.
Grace: ...Perhaps he is already amongst us. Who can say?
