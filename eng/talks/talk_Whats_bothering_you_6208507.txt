Traveler: What's bothering you?
Clerk Zhao: You'll laugh at me if I tell you, but... Well, my dream is to work my way up and become one of the Qixing one day. Someone big and successful.
Clerk Zhao: I know it sounds ridiculous, the idea of starting as a minor clerk and somehow ending up as one of the Qixing...
Clerk Zhao: But if I don't at least try, none of my dreams will ever become reality.
Clerk Zhao: Zhao, there's no time to waste...
Clerk Zhao: ...Aah, what am I doing here then!? I must get back to work!
Traveler: You really do work hard.
Clerk Zhao: If I want to become a member of the Liyue Qixing, this work-rate is just what is expected of me, isn't it?
Clerk Zhao: ...And honestly, I'm not working anywhere near hard enough.
Clerk Zhao: I've had to travel to Yuehai Pavilion many times in order to settle some matters. Every time I go there, I can see Miss Ganyu doing overtime work.
Clerk Zhao: Perhaps this is because she works directly for the Qixing at Yuehai Pavilion, while I'm just a small-time clerk...
Clerk Zhao: Argh.. No, I have to work harder!
