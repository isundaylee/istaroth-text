Traveler: How did you become Master of the Liyue branch?
Lan: Ugh, why does everyone ask me the same question... I will make an exception for you, though, and give you the full story.
Lan: I used to be a mercenary. I joined the Adventurers' Guild so I could take advantage of their superior intelligence network and track down the sword.
Lan: I may not be very literate but I can read the word "sword." So I just took on every single commission that had something to do with a sword.
Lan: Then, just when I'd finished my eighthâ€” Or was it my ninth commission? Anyway, I'd just finished it, and then word came from the headquarters in Snezhnaya that I'd apparently completed two S-rank commissions.
Lan: ...And suddenly I found myself promoted to branch Guild Master. It was all very strange indeed.
