Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Would you like to have a chat with me?</color>
Noelle: It would be my pleasure!
Noelle: Do you know something? Ever since I came here, I don't believe I've picked up a single item of lost property.
Noelle: I'm still not used to it...
Traveler: ...Huh?
Noelle: What I mean is, I often used to find odds and ends while performing my cleaning duties.
Noelle: For example... A faded headband under a cabinet.
Noelle: Or a ball hidden in a bush by a kitten.
Noelle: Or a bookmark in a corner of the library, keys dropped at the side of the road, an unsigned letter of confession stuck in the door of the church...
Traveler: Sounds like cleaning is quite exhausting...
Noelle: No, no, not at all! It is a great honor to perform my duties.
Noelle: Speaking of cleaning...
Noelle: This place always seems so clean and tidy.
Traveler: In no small part due to your efforts.
Noelle: Thank you...!
Noelle: It's always very fulfilling to work here! More so than when I'm cleaning for the Knights or anywhere else.
Noelle: Because... this is your home.
Traveler: Where do all these things end up?
Noelle: I always do my utmost to reunite each item with its owner! But the ones that go unclaimed remain at the Knights of Favonius headquarters.
Traveler: Wait, so you go around collecting random lost items?
Noelle: Nâ€”No, they're just items I find while cleaning...
