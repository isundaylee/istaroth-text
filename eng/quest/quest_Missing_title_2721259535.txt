# Missing title (2721259535)

Tanjiyy: Greetings, my yet-to-be-friend! Be you a traveler who frequents these trails?
Tanjiyy: Apologies for halting you halfway along your path but... Um, could you enlighten me as to the events that transpired here?
Traveler: #I'm {NICKNAME}. Pleased to meet you.
Tanjiyy: Tanjiyy, Vahumana Dastur, at your service. I came here to provide... educational assistance to the... Ah, yes, the Tanit.
Tanjiyy: This whole affair is most odd. This should be the right place, but... Oh, how did things turn like this...
Traveler: It's... a long story.
Tanjiyy: Could be tribal warfare, or some kind of internal conflict, hm? Very interesting. It's been centuries since a conflict occurred in these sands that saw an entire tribe annihilated.
Tanjiyy: Additionally, I discovered signs that I found most... ominous. I recommend against checking yourself. It's... revolting, and will likely make you retch.
Tanjiyy: Perhaps it might have been the work of survivors among them — survivors who later returned to gather most of the... abandoned belongings. Alas, I cannot be sure. Either way, it was a highly disquieting scene.
Traveler: ...
Tanjiyy: *sigh* How did I encounter something like this? I feel like I've witnessed an event that'll make into the history books...
Tanjiyy: Ahem. Anyway... would you like to play cards?
Tanjiyy: I found a few decks in those tents, and they're still in a decent state — after some cleaning, that is. If you're interested, perhaps we could have a game or two...
Traveler: Maybe they... migrated.
Tanjiyy: Migrated? No. Look, the supplies and the tents are right where they used to be. There's ash and signs of former habitation everywhere... Hm. Honestly, it's more like a great disaster swept through suddenly and upended all their lives.

Tanjiyy: Ah... Mm, I understand. My apologies... Take care.
