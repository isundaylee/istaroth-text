Traveler: How do you like it here?
Collei: Yeah, it's pretty nice. Great place to rest and recuperate.
Collei: It's actually quite normal for Forest Rangers to rough it out in the wild sometimes.
Collei: And during my wandering days, having a tent to keep the wind out was a luxury.
Collei: But still... I do prefer places with plenty of vegetation. It's nice being surrounded by constant reminders of the temerity of life.
Traveler: Wait... do you mean the "tenacity" of life...?
Collei: Huh!? "T—Tenacity"? Wait, is it?
Collei: I'm sorry, I only heard Master Tighnari say it once before... he said he likes living somewhere that is a testament to the... tenacity of life.
Traveler: So shall I plant some more trees?
Collei: No need! It's great as it is.
Collei: If you're gonna live somewhere for the long term, the most important thing to consider is how it makes you feel.
Collei: I really like it here. Thank you so much for inviting me.

Traveler: Want to chat?
Collei: Sounds good!
Collei: ...
Collei: ...Um, sorry, I thought you were gonna go first.
Collei: I don't have much experience in starting conversations... so I don't really know where to start.
Traveler: Don't worry. As it happens, I've got something I wanted to tell you.
Collei: Oh... Sure, go ahead! I'm all ears.
Traveler: Amber told me a few things about you...
Collei: Amber!? She mentioned me? What did she say? Wait, lemme grab my notebook, I need to write this down!
Traveler: Seeing you flourishing...
Collei: Heh, I don't know about flourishing — I've still got a long way to go... Was there anything else?
Traveler: She mentioned your recent letter...
Collei: Oh... I, um, I did my best...
Collei: I learned a few new words recently. I wanted to get the hang of them, so I tried to use them all in my letter.
Collei: But if that made it too difficult to read, I guess I was getting ahead of myself.
Collei: I need to take it slowly and use new words more carefully. Better to mix in a few new words with what I already know.
Traveler: I can spell-check your letters for you.
Collei: Really? Wow, thanks! Oh, and in that case, I need to call you "Master," too!
Traveler: She said there were quite a few spelling mistakes...
Traveler: Makes her really happy.
Traveler: Kaeya told me a few things about you...
Collei: K—Kaeya!? ...I'm sorry, I suddenly have a stomachache...
Traveler: He said you made quite a few spelling mistakes in your letter.
Collei: Oh, is that it? I was sure he'd gone and... Ahem, never mind.

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Collei: Actually, I was wondering about inviting you to go camping with me.
Collei: My mood's been pretty good these past few days, and I just finished an exam. Master Tighnari says I should take some time to relax.
Collei: We should find a nice wide open place to enjoy the scenery, and bring some ingredients to cook over the campfire.
Traveler: When are we leaving?
Collei: Um... I was thinking maybe we could leave today?
Traveler: Today!?
Collei: Um... well actually, I only handed in my exam paper so far. Master Tighnari said he'll mark it when he's got a spare moment...
Collei: But if I don't get a good mark, I'll have to start revising again right away.
Collei: And you said you were up for it, so I didn't want to let this opportunity go by...
Collei: Then again, now I think about it, even though we could find some ingredients on the ground, we'll need some time to think of a good location.
Collei: And if we're going out into the wild, there's a whole lot of other things we need to prepare for, too...
Traveler: How about we just go camping here?
Collei: Huh? Here? ...Actually, yeah, I never thought of that!
Collei: Plenty of open space, a great view, and no danger...
Traveler: Consider it the trial run before we go camping for real.
Collei: Alright! Ah, this is such a good idea. You're so good at this kind of thing.
Collei: Wait! Are you sure Tubby won't mind?
Traveler: Shall I get ready?

Collei: Wow, what a great little cabin! I'm sure the time would just fly by if I did some reading here.
Collei: But knowing me... I'd be bugging you for help every few seconds because there's so many words I don't know... That would definitely ruin the mood...
Collei: Uh... I think I'll stick with books I've read before, then. Always helps to have a refresher.

## Talk 10

Collei: Hmm... I see this hut is built from wooden stakes, lashed together nice and tight with a rope. It's really sturdy...
Collei: Looks like you know what you're doing! I don't have anything else to add.
Collei: Next time we go camping, let's try and set up a tent that's just as strong as this!
