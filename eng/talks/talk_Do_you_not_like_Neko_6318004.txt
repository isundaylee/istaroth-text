Traveler: Do you not like Neko?
Etsuko: I don't think I'd put it in those terms. I've just got no interest in her.
Etsuko: I came to this island to get this commission done.
Etsuko: I've never been very interested in much other than that.
Etsuko: The way I see it, if you get too invested in things outside the remit of your commission while you're doing it, you'll veer off onto a branching path...
Etsuko: And I wouldn't call that a good thing for a professional adventurer.
