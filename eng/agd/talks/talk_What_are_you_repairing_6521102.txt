Traveler: What are you repairing?
Denichere: This Gardemek. Heinry says it's the Motorized Autonomous Fonta Vending Machine's bodyguard. He even tried to install a recording device in it...
Denichere: But he should stick to making Fonta, it's all he's good at. I'm the only one who knows how to fix things.
