Traveler: And you are...
Seiji: Hi! I came to Sumeru on business with the Inazuma Shogunate official Sir Hanbei. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
Seiji: Hehe, speaking of which, it's a little embarrassing, but I was pretty nervous before coming here. This is my first time working abroad, and I can't let my superior down.
Seiji: But it seems like he's still getting some work ready, so he doesn't have anything important for me to do.
Seiji: So sometimes I'll come here to walk around and take in the sights and scenes of Sumeru.
