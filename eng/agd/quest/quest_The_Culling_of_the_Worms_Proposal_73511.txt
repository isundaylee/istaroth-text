# The Culling of the Worms: Proposal


## Talk 1

Shriya: That fool... running headfirst into the desert like that! Do something, Fodil, please! Give him a hand!
Fodil: Apologies. The garrison in the village is limited, and since we're tied up with keeping them from causing any trouble, we can't afford to spare any strength for now.
Shriya: But that fool has been bending over backwards to deal with them! At least, in the name of mutual interest...
Fodil: Well, it's not that we don't want to help. But the guards are now spread thinly across the desert on the lookout for them. Getting a team together is going to take time...
Shriya: How could this be... If we return to Caravan Ribat for help, it will most certainly be too late...
Traveler: Is someone in danger?
Shriya: Eh? You guys are...
Traveler: Just another adventurer passing by.
Paimon: #And his best friend, Paimon!
Shriya: Adventurers? Really!? Thank the heavens! There's help for Vinayak, at last!
Shriya: #Mr. Adventurer! Please save Vinayak. We'll make sure to reward you handsomely!
Traveler: First, tell me what's going on.
Fodil: Well, the desert has become more dangerous than before, thanks to those wretched vermin running amok. It's for the best that I fill you in on the situation before making plans.
Shriya: Eh... you guys are right. Sorry, I was a little anxious.
Paimon: Paimon's been hearing you talk about a certain "them" this whole time. What are they anyway?
Fodil: A swarm of Wenut. For some reason, they have recently become unusually violent, hiding in sandstorms to attack unsuspecting prey passing by.
Traveler: They're just bugs.
Fodil: When you put it that way, yes. But this time, there are far too many of them.
Fodil: It's hard to deal with them under the cover of a sandstorm, and they usually flee at the first sign of danger...
Paimon: Wow, that's quite the pickle you're in...
Shriya: It's not just Aaru Village. Other passing merchants have also been affected. That's why the Akademiya sent Vinayak and me to deal with these unruly Wenut.
Shriya: But the caravan we entrusted to deliver some components was attacked by Wenut on the way, and everything got swept up in sandstorms... I fear they've become the monsters' playthings by now...
Shriya: I wanted to return to Caravan Ribat for help, but Vinayak... Who knew that after all these years, he's still as rigid as a machine!
Shriya: He said something about getting his precious components back and just ran into the desert all by himself!
Shriya: Ahh!! Maybe I should just let the monsters take him!
Paimon: #Whoa... what should we do, Traveler? If we leave this matter alone, not only will that researcher be in danger, but the Wenut problem won't be resolved...
Traveler: This crisis in the desert can't be ignored.
Shriya: Thank you! Thank you so much! I'm sorry that I let my temper get the better of me... I'll mark the location of the attack on the map. Please find him as soon as possible!
Shriya: I hope he doesn't get the hare-brained idea to dive right into the horde of monsters and start picking up components...
Traveler: Leave the rescuing to me.
Traveler: I've dealt with way bigger enemies.
Traveler: Do you guys need help?

## Talk 2

Vinayak: Getting in from this angle, and using the terrain for cover... As long as the angle of sunlight isn't higher than... And my speed is no lower than... Hmm, that still isn't it!
Traveler: What are you trying to figure out?
Vinayak: A viable route to recover the components without having to face the monsters... Thanks to the Wenut, all my precious components got swept up by those monsters...
Vinayak: Whoa! Who are you? When did you show up!?
Traveler: I've been listening to you talk to yourself for a while now...
Paimon: Relax. We're not bad guys. Your friend sent us!
Vinayak: Friend? Could it be Shriya? No, she clearly said she wouldn't care if I was taken by the monsters...
Vinayak: Ah, I see. She sent you to get the components, right?
Vinayak: It doesn't matter if I'm taken by the monsters, but it will definitely matter if the components aren't recovered... Yeah, that sounds like something she would say.
Traveler: ...You could put it that way.
Vinayak: Still, thanks all the same. I'm racking my brain trying to figure this out. I was this close to rushing out and just taking it one step at a time.
Vinayak: ...One wrong step, and I'll get caught by the monsters.
Vinayak: Eh... If I wasn't here, and with Shriya being such a klutz... who else would be going to take care of these machines!?
Paimon: No wonder Shriya was so worried... This guy thinks about nothing but his mechanical components...
Paimon: #Traveler, let's go and get the components before he gets himself in trouble!
