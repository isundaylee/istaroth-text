# Dandelion, Rose, and Windwheel Aster


## Talk 1

Lisa: Hi there, cutie. It's good to see you.
Jean: It is certainly unusual for us to meet in a place like this, but as Lisa said, I'm glad to see you.
Lisa: Hey, what do you mean by "a place like this"? The tavern is a wonderful place to relax and unwind a little.
Lisa: *sigh* Do you have any idea how hard it was for me to drag the Acting Grand Master away from her desk?
Lisa: We've only been here for a few minutes and worry is already written all over her face.
Jean: *sigh* Lisa...
Traveler: Well, the Knights of Favonius do have a lot to handle...
Paimon: Yeah, this is the Acting Grand Master we're talking about. It's only natural that she has a lot on her plate!
Paimon: But you know what they say... "Now that we're already here..."
Paimon: #Why don't you let {F#her}{M#him} mix a couple of drinks for you two. It'll make you feel a lot better!
Traveler: Think of it as a way to unwind.
Lisa: Honestly, Jean is the only person I know who needs to be taught how to relax.
Lisa: Hey cutie, whip me up a Love Poem. Medium, extra sweet.
Lisa: And how about you, Jean? What are you in the mood for?
Jean: I'll just have... coffee. Medium, please.
Paimon: Master Jean, you drink coffee all the time. Wouldn't you like to try something else?
Jean: Thanks, but no. I want something to help keep me awake.
Traveler: Got it. Coming right up!
Jean: Thanks.

## Talk 2

Lisa: Mmm... The sweetness is just right. Very good.
Jean: The coffee is strong and rich with just a nice hint of bitterness to it.
Traveler: I'm glad you both like the drinks.
Jean: Actually, I do understand what you meant, Lisa.
Lisa: Hmm?
Jean: I've been reflecting on my weaknesses lately. There's still room for me to improve in many areas, such as my productivity and management...
Jean: I'm concerned my stress may even be starting to somehow affect you as well...
Traveler: I think you still don't quite understand.
Jean: What?
Lisa: Hehe. See? Cutie knows.
Lisa: You were working yourself way too hard, so I thought I'd take you out for some drinks. All I wanted was for you to have some fun.
Lisa: But even in the tavern, you're still thinking about work. That's what's most concerning.
Lisa: If you're constantly under stress like this, it's only a matter of time before you burn out.
Traveler: Exactly.
Jean: #Oh... You also agree with Lisa, Traveler?
Jean: Hmm, so... is learning to relax actually my biggest challenge?
Traveler: To quote a saying from Liyue: "Everything has a balance."
Paimon: Yep! Work hard, play hard, and rest even harder. The two of you may need even more rest than you'd expect!
Traveler: That's an... interesting way to put it.
Lisa: Hehe.
Jean: Alright, I... I understand.
Jean: Thank you, all of you. Now I know that this place serves refreshments for both the body and the mind. Is that why you and Kaeya like the tavern so much?
Lisa: Yes, and no. It really depends on who's making the drinks.
Lisa: Speaking of which, we couldn't have changed Jean's mind without you today. You sure have a way with words, Cutie.
Traveler: Don't mention it.
Lisa: Hehe, then we'll see you later.
Jean: I'll consider coming here to relax if I have another opportunity.
Paimon: Sounds great. Take care, you two!
Traveler: I'm glad I could help.
