Traveler: Adeptal fruit...?
Tu: That's right, they say that this adeptal fruit was created from the very essence of the adeptal energies of heaven and earth themselves. If a mortal were to eat it, they would be granted great longevity, and power enough to fell a bull in a single punch!
Tu: Of course, I don't know if that's true or not, but I'd sure like to have a bite and see what it tastes like.
