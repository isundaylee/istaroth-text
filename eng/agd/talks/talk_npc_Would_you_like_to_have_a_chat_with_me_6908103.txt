# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Kaveh: Sure. Anything you want to talk about?
Kaveh: It's probably best if I don't pick the topic of conversation. I've had people tell me that I just end up rambling on endlessly about my profession.
Traveler: Tell me about your life, then.
Kaveh: My life? Hmm... There's a lot I could talk about, but I don't know where to start...
Kaveh: I guess I'll share this... There was once a time in my life when I lived in abject poverty. Bankruptcy led to many a misfortune â€” in this world, if you don't have money, you essentially have no dignity.
Kaveh: I hated living like that, but I also had no quick way out of that situation. Every day was a struggle between my ego and my reality.
Kaveh: I had a lot of pride about being a master architect, so I detested the idea of doing anything else for a living... Only later did I learn about the more difficult aspects of life.
Kaveh: I was far more idealistic during my years as a student. I hate to admit it, but... an overly naive person cannot survive in this world.
Kaveh: Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to take the conversation to such a heavy place. Please pretend I didn't say anything.
Traveler: Tell me about what you like.
Kaveh: Hm, things I like... I recently bought a new coffee grinder. It's been great.
Kaveh: It's so elaborately made, and, most importantly, each component is perfectly in its place.
Kaveh: It doesn't have any extra screws or parts, and it grinds beans quickly and silently. It was a great purchase.
Kaveh: Ah, I left the house in a hurry today, so I didn't bring anything with me... I'll bring you some finely ground coffee next time.
