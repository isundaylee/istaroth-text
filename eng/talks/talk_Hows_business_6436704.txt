Yinjie: Besides a mysterious product called "Ultra Supreme Survivor Bundle Against Ultimate Sandstorm" that occasionally takes some of my business, I'm actually doing well.

Yinjie: With substantial risks come substantial profits, but one should not be blinded by the benefit and overlook the danger, don't you think?
