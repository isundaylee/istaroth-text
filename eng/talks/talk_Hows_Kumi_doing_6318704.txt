Traveler: How's Kumi doing?
Anisa: Thanks to you, she's cheered up a lot.
Anisa: That said, she's taken all these tasks onto herself... Watching her run around like that makes me wish I could help her out a bit...
Anisa: Ah yes, speaking of that... I've learned how to make some local dishes from Little Kumi in the meantime, and I've also added a little spin on them from my hometown.
Anisa: Hehe, I'm sure you'd like it!
Anisa: Wanna try some when you get the chance next time?
