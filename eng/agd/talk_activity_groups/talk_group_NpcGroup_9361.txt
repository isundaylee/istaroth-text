## Talk

Alhaitham: Rest time, you say?
Alhaitham: Mm. Then let's give our vocal cords a rest.
Alhaitham: Grab some coffee, and spend some time thinking about the things you're usually too busy for.

## Talk

Alhaitham: Having a challenging mid-to-long-term goal is a good thing.
Alhaitham: This applies equally to combat, job-seeking, and the pursuit of knowledge.
Alhaitham: But what people get out of achieving their goal depends on the individual.

## Talk

Alhaitham: Quite a few books.
Alhaitham: Storybooks, mostly. A rare sight in the House of Daena â€” they claim it would distract the students from their studies.
Alhaitham: But if the fate of a student's studies depends on externally imposed restrictions, whether to storybooks or otherwise, they won't make it far in academia.
