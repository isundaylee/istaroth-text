Traveler: About the tea leaves...
Uncle Luo: The issue with the water and the soil has been resolved thanks to you and the adeptus. But the tea... The new harvest needs time, so we'll just have to give the re-baked aged tea to the merchants.
Uncle Luo: Moreover, variations in the water and the soil have a huge impact. I mean, even a little bit of extra rain can bring the quality of the tea down.
Uncle Luo: With such drastic changes, there's no guarantee that we'll grow great tea going forward, adeptus's help or not.
