Traveler: How do you like it here?
Kinich: Yes. It's a nice environment. Comfortable, too.
Ajaw: Really, Kinich? Man, you have low standards.
Ajaw: Don't get me wrong, it's quite impressive for a basic slum. But it's a far cry from the Nation of Flame when I was the ruler.
Ajaw: Back then, I had a grand castle at the highest point in the nation, with an endless stream of worshipers coming to pay tribute to the Almighty Dragonlord, K'uhul Ajaw.
Ajaw: You could not fathom the gifts they would bring... Fine wine made from the freshest red fruits, opulent chests full of treasure... And that was the bare minimum!
Traveler: Very impressive.
Kinich: You'd think that as an almighty dragonlord and supreme ruler, you'd know how to be a good guest as well as a good host.
Ajaw: Hmph...
Kinich: Thank you for inviting me here.
Kinich: When I camp outdoors, all I require is a bonfire or a cave to rest in. But this place provides both safety and comfort, which is hard to come by elsewhere.
Kinich: How can I repay you?
Traveler: Ah, there's no need...
Kinich: I'm serious. I don't intend to accept your kindness for free — I insist.
Kinich: So if there's anything you want from me at all, please be up front with me. I will consider how best to complete the task, and take it from there. Simple and straightforward.
Traveler: This is kinda sudden. I've got nothing in mind...
Kinich: Fair enough... Then let's just say, I owe you one for now.
Kinich: Let me know once you've thought of something.
Kinich: And of course, in the unlikely event that the price isn't right, I'll tell you right away.
Traveler: This must be quite the humble change of pace.

## Talk 1

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Kinich: What would you like to know?
Traveler: Depends... Do different topic come at different costs?
Kinich: Yes. The price of information is determined by many factors.
Kinich: But you don't look like you're in a bind or anything... Maybe just a regular chat, then?
Traveler: I'd like to hear about your Saurian hunts.
Kinich: That won't exactly be a fun and light-hearted conversation.
Ajaw: #Aw, what's wrong, Kinich? Don't want your friend to know what a cruel hunter you really are? Scared the gory details will keep him up at night?
Traveler: I'll be fine.
Kinich: Don't listen to Ajaw. It's nothing that terrifying.
Kinich: Saurians are our companions. But if the Abyss corrupts them beyond redemption, or people lead them astray...
Kinich: Then someone has to step up, and end their lives before they do any more harm.
Kinich: Any wild beast will fight savagely when it's backed into a corner, let alone a fierce Saurian.
Kinich: So, I usually start by using poison arrows to dull the target's senses, then lure it into a trap to immobilize it. Once it's incapacitated, I head in and finish the job.
Traveler: Sounds like dangerous work...
Kinich: I won't deny that, but even "danger" can be tamed with enough experience and preparation.
Kinich: If you're interested in Saurian-hunting, I'll let you know the next time I receive a suitable commission.
Kinich: We can pick poisonous berries, set some traps together... And you'll get your share of the reward, too.
Traveler: So what was the toughest Saurian you ever had to deal with?
Kinich: Ajaw.
Ajaw: Excuse me? How dare you mock me to my face! You big-mouthed bipedal bug!
Kinich: Greed and conceit are common vices of evil dragons. They're easy ones to exploit.
Kinich: And the big, lumbering types have more strength than coordination. As long as you're agile enough, you just keep dodging their attacks until you find an opening.
Kinich: But Ajaw's unique — not only evil and powerful, but clear-minded too. It's an extremely rare combination.
Ajaw: Hah, so NOW you try and sing my praises? Well, if you're looking to curry favor, it won't work. The Almighty Dragonlord wasn't born yesterday!
Kinich: Scratch my last statement. If you really were clear-minded, you'd know none of that was meant as a compliment.
Ajaw: Aw, don't be shy! How many times do I need to tell you? Bottom-feeders like you have a valuable role to play — you give the almighty dragonlord something to look down on from the top of the food chain! So please, fawn away!
Kinich: *sigh*... So yeah. You see what I have to deal with?
Traveler: Hmm... Mind if we skip the gruesome bits?

## Talk 2

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Kinich: Up to you. I have no current jobs, so I'm down for whatever.
Kinich: Would you like something to drink? Some Quenepa and Cacahuatl Juice, perhaps?
Ajaw: Whoa! Hey, me first! Gimme some of that! Gimme gimme gimme!
Traveler: And how much will this "cost" me?
Kinich: Heh. This one's free.
Kinich: In Natlan, Cacahuatl is mainly used to make chocolate and a beverage called Xocoatl. The most valuable part of the plant is the fermented seeds.
Kinich: But everything has its use. The white fleshy part can be pressed to extract the juice, which makes a delicious drink when mixed with the right ingredients.
Ajaw: Are you done with the backstory? Gimme my juice, already! I can't wait any longer!
Kinich: At first, I tried mixing it with Flamegranates, which are native to Huitztlan. The resulting drink was packed full of phlogiston, suitable for both humans and Saurians alike.
Kinich: But due to some difficulties getting hold of the ingredients, I eventually switched to Quenepa Berries instead, and tweaked the rest of the recipe accordingly.
Ajaw: Kinich! You're doing this on purpose, you never talk for this long! Especially not to explain yourself!
Ajaw: This isn't a history lesson, so cut the tangents already!
Kinich: I'm just trying to help a good friend understand this drink better, so they can appreciate it more.
Kinich: Not that you'd understand that, because you can't tell one cup of juice from another anyway. That's why I've never bothered to tell you before.
Ajaw: You little...!
Traveler: Well... Your explanation's made me curious, that's for sure!
Kinich: In that case, two cups of the juice, coming right up.
Traveler: What's that?
Kinich: A phlogiston juice blend that I created myself.

## Talk 3

Traveler: Good morning, Kinich.
Kinich: Good morning. Safe travels today.
Ajaw: Wait, wait, wait, wait. You disrespectful heathens! How dare you deprive the dragon supreme of a morning greeting? This is criminal conduct! Punishable by... Hey! Are you even listening!?

## Talk 4

Traveler: Good night, Kinich.
Kinich: Alright. Forget your worries and sleep well. Good night.
Ajaw: Haha, imagine needing nightly sleep and being scared of the dark! You poor, wretched mortals with your pathetic, frail bodies... We pity you.
Kinich: If you're above needing sleep, O supreme ruler, I guess you won't be needing any food either?
Ajaw: How dare you threaten me, servant! I will haunt your nightmares!

## Talk 8

Kinich: Impressive observation skills. I can tell from the layout and the decor that you understand my tribe well... Take a look at these colored Flamegranate husks, for instance.
Kinich: They're hardy enough that the Scions of the Canopy often use them as containers for deliveries. And when necessary, they can also be used for self-defense. Here, I'll show you:
Ajaw: How dare you demonstrate that on your sovereign ruler! Do you have a death wish!?

## Talk 9

Ajaw: Well, well, these trees and plants really look the part, don't they? For a moment there, I thought we were at Kinich's home.
Ajaw: Feeling homesick? Moved to tears? Go ahead, let it out, you can ugly cry here! And hey, maybe if you ask your friends nicely, they'll make you a nice mountain to rest your little head so you can live here forever!
Kinich: That still leaves the problem of where to put you. And this place is far too pleasant for a Saurian who just earned himself another timeout.
