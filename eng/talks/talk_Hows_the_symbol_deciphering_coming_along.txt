Traveler: How's the symbol deciphering coming along?
Huixing: Ah, ahoy there, Traveler! Welcome aboard the Alcor!
Huixing: It's been quite tough, I won't lie, but it's gone well enough. We've obtained quite a lot of nautical maps from various sources, so a full deciphering will take some time yet.
Huixing: I've heard that you're quite the code-breaker and puzzle-solver yourself. If I had your help, this would probably be much easier...
Huixing: ...Well, when you're free, of course! Also, feel free to tell me if you need anything!
