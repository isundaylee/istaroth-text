## Talk

Ryuuji: If you need me to investigate, let me know.

## Talk

Traveler: About the commission...
Ryuuji: Go talk to President Sango if it is about the commission's status. Leave the intel gathering to me. I will go where she tells me to.
Ryuuji: You can call me Takeo or Ryuuji... Actually, never mind. Just call me Ryuuji.
Ryuuji: Takeo is my real name, but President Sango thinks it isn't tough-sounding enough, so she insists on calling me Ryuuji. This does bother me... but I'll listen to her.

## Talk

Traveler: About President Sango...
Ryuuji: Although President Sango has a short fuse, she is actually an upright person. You can trust her ability. When I was wrongly accused back in the day, she was the one who cleared my name.
Ryuuji: I used to be a constable at the Police Station. Someone framed me, and I was suspended from my post. If it weren't for President Sango's amazing intelligence, I could not imagine how I would end up...
Ryuuji: After the matters were taken care of, the president didn't even ask me for payment after seeing that I was broke. She even agreed to let me be her assistant.
Ryuuji: Now, my name has been cleared, and I can work for President Sango. It's all the grace of the Electro Archon...

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Ryuuji: Let's talk again when we have a new lead. See you.

## Talk

Traveler: Adventure Challenge

## Talk

Ryuuji: Good, I know how to do it now. In the future, I'll deal with Sango using this deck of yours...

## Talk

Ryuuji: Did... did I win? Ah, actually I don't know the rules. This game was set up by Sango...

## Talk

Traveler: Are you busy?
Ryuuji: You've probably heard about Inazuma's current situation.
Ryuuji: Even the police... aren't fully reliable.
Ryuuji: If President Sango's responsibility is using her wits to solve cases, then my responsibility is to support her using my physical abilities. In short, due to the changing world, things are becoming complicated. We'll have to sort them out one by one.
