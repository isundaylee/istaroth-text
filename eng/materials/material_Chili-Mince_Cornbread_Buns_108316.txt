# Chili-Mince Cornbread Buns

A traditional snack from Liyue. The fresh dough is turned out into a round, rested, and then placed inside a cage to steam. The meat and vegetables are then washed and diced, before being fried quickly in an oiled wok. When eaten, the fried condiments must be placed into the empty space in the middle of the buns before they are eaten together. Between the crisp vegetables and the flavorful meat, this is solid, great flavor.
