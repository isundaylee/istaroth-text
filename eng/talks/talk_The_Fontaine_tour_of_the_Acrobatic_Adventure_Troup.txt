Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "While our troupe was performing a firebreathing act in front of the Palais Mermonia, the fire suppression systems were accidentally activated, resulting in water damage to a large number of files. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Due to the unlawful usage of open flames during a performance near the Palais Mermonia, the license of the Acrobatic Adventure Troupe to tour has been temporarily revoked. We hope that all citizens will learn from their mistake.
