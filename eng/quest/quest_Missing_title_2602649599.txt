### Additional Talk 1

Al: If we can recover Princess Lyris's treasure, the forces of justice will grow ever mightier with the passage of time! The day of our victory over Narcissus grows near!
Al: ...This is why we cannot forget Ney's heroic sacrifice. Had he not hidden the treasure, Narcissus would surely have already breached the tower where the princess resides.
Petit Chou: Yeah! Ney is super amazing!
Al: #We will not let Ney's efforts be in vain, nor will we fail to honor {NICKNAME}'s extraordinary contributions! This time, with all of your help, we will save Princess Lyris!
Petit Chou: Yeah! We'll save Princess Lyris, and then, and then...
Al: And then the Narzissenkreuz Kingdom will be restored to its former radiant glory! The Princess shall hold you in her arms, groom your feathers, and gently pat your tiny little forehead!
Al: The memories lost in the waters will resurface, and all our friends will surround the princess and laugh together! It will be a scene filled with beauteous joy, and never again will disputes or trouble cloud the horizon.
Petit Chou: Just like before!
Al: ...That's right, just like before.

Jak: We will finally have a chance to defeat the invaders from without and save Ms. Lyris! Thus shall Orchestre Jak perform...
Jak: The last movement of the overture!
Traveler: Seriously? Just the overture...?
Jak: Oh? You really think that everything would just come to an end after saving Ms. Lyris and rebuilding the kingdom? Hah! The real world is no simple little fairytale!
Jak: It's because the world is full of naive simpletons that think like you that history always repeats itself! The next step is obviously to overthrow the deeply entrenched class structure and methods of distributing society's wealth.
Jak: In a world that is reasonably equal, equality must be the reasonable state, and this is certainly what Ms. Lyris strives for. Now, consideration for present circumstances has led to the due juxtaposition of...
Traveler: That's my cue to leave...
Jak: First, naturally based upon... we should... construct... overturn...
Traveler: I would have thought it was the climax of the symphony.

Mori: (sniffs)
Mori: Woof woof! Good person. Pet?

But Mori looks very happy.
Mori: Woof woof! Thank you, good person!
Traveler: I'll pet you more next time, Mori.

Traveler: What does that have to do with being good or bad?
Mori: Woof woof! Good dogs get scritches. Bad dogs get... fixed.
Mori: *whimpering*
Black Screen Text: Seeing Mori sad, you reach out a hand to pet Mori.
As Mori is a (hound) made of water, it's quite wet.

Mori: Woof woof! Thank you for the pets!
