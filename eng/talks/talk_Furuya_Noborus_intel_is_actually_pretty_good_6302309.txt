Traveler: Furuya Noboru's intel is actually pretty good.
Yuzu: About him... if it weren't for me pushing hard on the issues about the Sakoku Decree back then, I wouldn't even have realized that he was a senior member of the Adventurers' Guild.
Yuzu: But while he seems to be weak and unfit, he is actually a very seasoned adventurer. I've heard that many adventurers in the guild go to him for advice.
Yuzu: He is not a bad fellow. But he's been of little help when it comes to heading overseas.
