Traveler: Steady there, Mr. Enthusiastic...
Isak: Ah, I... Sorry, I didn't mean to bother you...
Isak: But you saved Grandpa, and that makes you our family's hero! Thank you so much!
Isak: Ever since that incident, I've been thinking that I should work harder so I can help my Grandpa, just like you did!
Isak: Miss Candace always says that I should be thankful to those who've helped me and that I should learn from them.
