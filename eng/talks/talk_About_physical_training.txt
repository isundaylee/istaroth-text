Traveler: About physical training...
Zhenhai: Oh, are you interested in training, too? Perhaps we should find a place to do some sparring on one of my days off.
Zhenhai: Although my role in the Millelith is mostly an administrative one, I still prefer to stay fighting fit when I can.
Zhenhai: That's why I often take odd jobs that involve physical labor. A little extra muscle mass where it counts does wonders for one's appearance, don't you think?
