Kachina: These books are all out of order... but I can't just go re-organizing other people's things...
Kachina: Still, I just found one I really like! It's all about brave dragon-riding knights defeating a dark lord! There's nothing the hero and his dragon buddy can't do â€” they're amazing!
Kachina: I'm going to tell Ayo this story when I get back! I bet he'll love it so much, he'll do a little dance!
