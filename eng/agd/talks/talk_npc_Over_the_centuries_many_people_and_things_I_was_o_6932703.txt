Ganyu: Over the centuries, many people and things I was once so close to have slowly faded away. Human lives are short, and sometimes it can feel like nothing of a person's legacy survives.
Ganyu: But there was one time I was listening to a storyteller. To my surprise, their new tale was all about the life of one of my old friends...
Ganyu: As the storyteller spoke, I could almost hear my dear friend's voice and laughter again, and scenes from the past seemed to flash before my eyes... I guess this is why humans like to write stories.
