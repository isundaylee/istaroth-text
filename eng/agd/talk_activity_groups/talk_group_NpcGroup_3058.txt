Yata Kouki: Hello! Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting...
Yata Kouki: Wait, who are you? What is your business here?

## Talk

Traveler: I'm just passing through.
Yata Kouki: Really?
Yata Kouki: Hmm... You weren't doing anything suspicious earlier, that's for sure. You may pass.
Yata Kouki: The exit's that way, so don't wander around. The headquarters of the Tenryou Commission can be a confusing place, and you don't want to get "lost."

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Yata Kouki: I'm warning you. Don't you get any wicked ideas!
