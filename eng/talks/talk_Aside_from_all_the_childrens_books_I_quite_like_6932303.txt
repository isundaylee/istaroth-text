Tartaglia: Aside from all the children's books, I quite like some of the furnishings here. Like that Star Lamp, for example. I'm sure Tonia, Anthon, and Teucer would love it.
Tartaglia: Okay, there's my intro: "My dear sister, I am writing to you from a rest stop in an ancient castle filled with star lamps"...
Tartaglia: Hmm... Maybe that'll get them a little too intrigued? If they end up wanting to follow me here after reading this letter, then we'll be in trouble.
