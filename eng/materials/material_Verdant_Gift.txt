# Verdant Gift

Escoffier's inspired creation. A well-presented asparagus salad presented like a lush, green bouquet and drizzled with yellowy-orange sauce. A fresh, crisp mouthful that captures the vitality of soft, young shoots at the very instant they break the surface of the soil â€” it's almost as though Escoffier has moved beyond mastering the careful control of heat and flavor and is now cooking with time itself.
