Traveler: What are you doing?
Chalmet: Honorary Senior Researcher, how wonderful to see you. I'm organizing these files and folders in accordance with Monsieur Raimondo's instructions.
Chalmet: This part of the archive wasn't so badly hit by the explosion and is still structurally sound, so the files are in good shape.
Chalmet: Although I'm not sure how useful they are now... But we should at least get them properly filed first.

Traveler: Have you found anything of value?
Chalmet: A lot of it is old and out of date. Reports, memos, progress updates, things like that.
Chalmet: But I found also some data from projects which were halted before completion, and even some detailed descriptions of their work.
Chalmet: And those could be useful, as the Institute is planning to restart its research projects.
Chalmet: So overall, everything is moving in the right direction. How wonderful.
