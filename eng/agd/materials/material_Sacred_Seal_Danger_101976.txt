A stone plate with ancient text on it that seems to have once been part of a certain building. The desert sands play host to many an unknown wish. Who made them, and who carries them now? The symbol seems to indicate the hazardous circumstance of hanging a chisel hammer on a cliff, and is thought to have emerged at a later date.
