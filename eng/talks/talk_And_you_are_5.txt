Traveler: And you are?
Vert Jr.: Hello there, my friendly and passionate friend. I'm Vert Jr., and I hail from Quartier Lyonnais in the Court of Fontaine, where I'm really known as Petit Vert.
Vert Jr.: After arriving in Yilong Wharf, my friends in Liyue nicknamed me Vert Jr. based on my name's meaning.
Vert Jr.: Vert, or green, is the color of tea leaves. So far, it's made the locals more affable toward me and helped build my personal brand...
Vert Jr.: And in the long term, I'll be having an extended stay in Yilong Wharf to carefully study and promote the local cuisine.
Vert Jr.: Hmm... Why don't I call my first travel guide "Vert's Vouchsafes"!
