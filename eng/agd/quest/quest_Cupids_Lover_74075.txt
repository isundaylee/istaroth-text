# Cupid's Lover


## Talk 1

Paimon: This door's already open? Wait a minute, Paimon thought it was sealed.
Caterpillar: ...

## Talk 2

Seymour: Is this the place? I've confirmed the presence of another stone tablet in my field of vision.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Black Screen Text: You carefully inspect the top of the mechanism, but you don't find anything.
Paimon: There's nothing here?
Caterpillar: It looks like something was here, but someone else took it.
Paimon: Wait, doesn't that mean that our plan's already failed?
Caterpillar: The birth of "reason" requires the merging of the four orthants. If we can get the rest of them, we still have a chance.
Ann: In that case, we'd better hurry to the next area.

### Additional Talk 2

Black Screen Text: You carefully inspect the top of the mechanism, but you don't find anything.
Paimon: There's nothing here either...
Ann: What exactly are we looking for, Caterpillar?
Caterpillar: We're looking for the materials necessary to forge the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz.
Caterpillar: The Ordo was able to reproduce the four requisite hypothetical substances here in the material world, based on the esoteric philosophies of the underground kingdom and ancient Fontaine.
Seymour: I do not understand.
Caterpillar: These enigmatic substances are purely experiential. You could say they are even further beyond ordinary logic than elemental power.
Seymour: I entered all introductory to intermediate level textbooks from the Akademiya's Spantamad into my memory banks decades ago. There is nothing mysterious about elemental power.
Caterpillar: Is that so? Anyway, to sum up, this is born of the confluence of traditions from Fontaine and technology from the ancient underground kingdom.
Caterpillar: And thus, four types of substance came into being: Memory, Wish, Soul, and Persona.
Caterpillar: To avoid any possible ambiguity, let's call them the "Memory" piece, "Wish" piece, "Soul" piece, and "Persona" piece.
Paimon: Why are these used to make the Holy Blade?
Caterpillar: In the Narzissenkreuz Ordo's brand of mystical philosophy, the temple is a microcosm of the universe, the members are stand-ins for the gods, and the holy oil is tempered willpower.
Caterpillar: The Holy Blade, on the other hand, is "reason," that which cuts everything open. It can only be born out of consummate human will.
Traveler: Quite abstruse.
Caterpillar: That's esotericism for you. You attach yourself to anything that looks similar enough, and when this sort of thing becomes magic, fiction becomes reality.
Caterpillar: Anyway, we should make our way to the next area now.

### Additional Talk 3

Black Screen Text: You carefully inspect the top of the mechanism, but you don't find anything.
Paimon: Did someone... take whatever was here, too?
Caterpillar: Looks that way.
Traveler: Just who is...?
Caterpillar: It's Jakob.
Seymour: We had an altercation with him inside Elynas once... Clarification: Recently, not "once."
Caterpillar: When I saw that unfortunate victim at the gate, I knew it was his handiwork. It seems he's still active after all.
Paimon: Then what does he want with the stuff he took from here?
Caterpillar: Simple â€” He too wants to reforge the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz. The dream of the Ordo remains unrealized.
Caterpillar: Anyway, we should make our way to the final area now.

### Additional Talk 4

Black Screen Text: You carefully inspect the top of the mechanism, but you don't find anything.
Paimon: There's nothing here?
Paimon: Oh no! It looks like someone already took whatever was here.
Paimon: But who?

### Additional Talk 5

### Additional Talk 6

Black Screen Text: You carefully inspect the top of the mechanism, but you don't find anything.
