Traveler: Who are you, anyway?
Kujirai Momiji: Oh, right. I thought you were here to join the Guild. So you don't recognize me, huh.
Kujirai Momiji: Allow me to introduce myself, then. I am the successor to the Kujirai Fishing Method and the founder of the Kujirai Guild â€” Kujirai Momiji, daughter of the ocean!
Kujirai Momiji: *sigh* Come on, don't look at me like that.
Kujirai Momiji: As a fisherwoman, I was born near the ocean, grew up near the ocean... and someday, I will return to it as well.
Kujirai Momiji: So there should be no problem in me calling myself the "daughter of the ocean" and stuff, right?
