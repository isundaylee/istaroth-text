Huixin: Oh, it's you. How may I help?
Huixin: I've heard that you contributed greatly to the rebuilding of the Jade Chamber and to the relatively small amount of damage that Liyue Harbor suffered at the hands of our ocean-borne enemy. You have my thanks.
Huixin: Please enjoy the Lantern Rite for the duration of your stay.
