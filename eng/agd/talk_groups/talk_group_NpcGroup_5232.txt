Bleu: What's all this? You lost the Bulle Fruit along the way!?
Blanc: Calm down! Just head back and pick some...
Bleu: Goodness! You really don't know how important these supplies are?
Bleu: We've spent so much time getting ready, I really don't want any more hassle with these Bulle Fruit.
Blanc: Alright, I've got it. We need to bury the prepared supplies near the Rainbow Rose, for whoever needs help.
Bleu: So you still remember the job Boss Rouge gave us...
Blanc: Of course I remember! Boss Rouge is a real gent!
Blanc: But... I have to say, we ought to do this happily, and with a chivalrous heart.
Blanc: Don't look so sad, Bleu. Cheer up.
Bleu: Okay. Last one. Be a bit more careful this time, and don't leave anything out again.
