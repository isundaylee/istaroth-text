Once, there was a glorious kingdom established among the heavens
From that kingdom came a crowned heir, tasked with seeking out the Genesis Pearl from the Kingdom of Darkness
The first crowned heir began her journey of seeking the pearl
But she was deceived, and the memory of her noble origins faded
She now believed that she was the queen of the Kingdom of Darkness
But take heart, a second crowned heir had already taken up the path where the first had stumbled
This is the story of your journey, of your tale to be told
