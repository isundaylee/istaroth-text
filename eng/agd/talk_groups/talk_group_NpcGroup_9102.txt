Mualani: The final destination of every journey is home.
Mualani: Hehe, so I knew you'd show up here eventually!

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Mualani: Hehe, I feel right at home! But it takes a lot to faze me — I've always been comfortable with new places and new faces.
Mualani: By the way, did you know that most Saurian companions can get real territorial? They only let people they know into their space.
Mualani: Since you invited me here, that means you consider me a good friend — and that's a real honor! Heh, I'm so happy, I've been smiling all day!
Traveler: That's right. That's me, a terrifyingly territorial Saurian.
Mualani: Hahaha! Then I gotta say, I like what you've done with your lair!
Mualani: In Natlan, Saurians are like friends and family to us. They're an irreplaceable part of our lives.
Mualani: You're important to me as well, as one of my close friends. That's why I made that analogy in the first place.
Traveler: Eee!
Mualani: ...Eh?
Traveler: How about that? Sounds like a happy Koholasaur?
Mualani: Hahaha! Okay, yeah, I gotcha!
Mualani: Eee! Eee! Eee!
Traveler: How does a Saurian show when they're happy? Is there a specific sound they make?
Mualani: Eh? Hahaha, that's a tough one. Ummm... Why don't we make one up?
Mualani: It can be like a secret code we use just with each other! A happy signal, to show when we're in a good mood, or use as a greeting, or even as a laugh!

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Mualani: Couldn't have picked a better moment! I just got back — took a walk around the place and then had a chat with Tubby. But now, I'm all yours!
Traveler: I see you're getting along nicely!
Mualani: Well, you gotta make an effort when you go somewhere new. I always like taking walks and talking to the locals...
Mualani: So, how about you? I'm curious, what do you do to try and fit in when you arrive someplace new?
Traveler: I make detailed travel plans ahead of time.
Mualani: Huh... Sounds very meticulous. So I guess you're the kind of tourist who never misses out on a single highlight, huh?
Mualani: You probably explore every village, walk down every last street, try all the best dishes on all the good menus, tick every scenic spot off the list...
Mualani: I can just imagine it... Ah, traveling with you would be so fulfilling!
Mualani: Alright! I'll keep your preferences in mind for the next time we travel together!
Mualani: It'll be a journey into the unknown... Ah, I can't wait!
Traveler: Would you still look forward to visiting places you've already been to?
Mualani: Of course!
Mualani: Most tourists who come to our tribal land on vacation stick to the popular routes, so I've gone over those countless times.
Mualani: I could literally navigate them with my eyes closed if I wanted. Not even exaggerating.
Mualani: But I never would. Because even when it's a road I've been down before, each time I go, it's a new journey.
Mualani: All kinds of things make each trip unique, whether it's the clouds in the sky, the ever-changing weather, the wildflowers by the side of the road... or all the wild animals that give you a fright when they jump out of nowhere...
Mualani: And that's not getting to visitors suddenly changing their plans and heading off the beaten path into some tiny, winding trail... Hmm...
Traveler: Now that's what you call a tough customer!
Mualani: Hmm? Oh, no, I wasn't complaining. I actually don't mind at all.
Mualani: Just the opposite, in fact. More twists and turns means a more varied and scenic route, so it's no loss at all! Hehe...
Traveler: Should've expected that from you! So next time, we'll also take the road-less-traveled!
Mualani: Uh... Sure, I guess?
Mualani: I'll gladly go wherever you want! But remember, if you ever get sick of walking everywhere...
Mualani: Just hop onto my surfboard!
Traveler: I take things as they come. Comfort comes first.
Mualani: Same! I approve, two thumbs up from me! And two big toes as well.
Mualani: I dunno about you, but for me, a big part of taking things as they come is... not necessarily being a morning person. Haha...
Mualani: Sometimes it's nice to just explore without a set goal, see where the journey takes you. Of course, that can lead to nice and nasty surprises, but... I guess that's all part of the fun!

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Mualani: Tell you what, let's organize a party!
Mualani: I mean, this is huge venue, and you've got so many friends...
Mualani: The atmosphere would be electric — I can feel it in my bones already!
Traveler: What would you say to a pool party, then?
Mualani: Right on! That's my number one kind of party!
Mualani: And since I'm the one who started this, don't you worry! Just leave all the set-up to me.
Mualani: Hmm... First, we need a sense of scale. If everyone shows up, we'll need a giant pool — maybe even a super sized one! Tricky, tricky...
Mualani: ...Ooh, ooh, I've got it! I'll get Kachina to loan Turbo Twirly to us. If we haven't got enough pool space, we can just dig ourselves some more!
Mualani: Oh yeah — and my store can sponsor the watersports-related equipment and swimsuits. I just need to get a larger shipment of supplies...
Traveler: Guess you really are loaded, Mualani.
Mualani: Aw, come on. I just think it's worth splashing out if it means all my friends get to have a good time.
Mualani: Worse comes to worst, I'll just have to hustle a bit more once it's over. Work hard, play hard, y'know?
Mualani: Alright, so we're doing this, yeah?
Mualani: Phew, I'm getting a little nervous. First time I'll be organizing something this huge...
Traveler: So even you get stage fright when the crowd's large enough...
Mualani: Nah, I'm just concerned that I won't be able to get everyone's attention without a big and dramatic entrance.
Traveler: But of course! I should have known...
Mualani: Heh, come on, you know I love a good crowd and a chance to shine under the spotlight!
Mualani: Anyway, any suggestions? I know you've got a ton of ideas!
Traveler: Hmm... Maybe enter with a song?
Mualani: Hey... Yeah, how did I not think of that? I'll have to steal some tricks from the Flower-Feather Clan though. They're all really strong singers.
Mualani: Thanks for the suggestion. Hehe, prepare to be amazed.
Mualani: You won't know what hit you when I take the stage!
Traveler: Perhaps you could do a dance as you came in?
Mualani: Perfect! Time for some emergency training with the Children of Echoes — their dances are sure-fire spotlight grabbers.
Traveler: A hot spring party sounds like a great idea!
Mualani: For real? Hey, that's our tribe's specialty, you know! I've got you covered!
Mualani: Now, we'll have to account for everyone's tastes when picking the snacks and drinks, so we'll probably need to get a good amount of everything... Hmm, let's definitely load up on Saurus Crackers. They're our local specialty, after all...

## Talk 9

Mualani: Am I seeing things? Or did you literally teleport my entire home here? It's like a treat within a treat!
Mualani: You know what I mean? Like when you buy a drink, and under the bottle cap it says "Have Another Drink" — and then you go get your free drink, and that one gives you ANOTHER free drink! A string of good luck.
Mualani: #I wanna share some of this good luck around, starting with you. Here you go: Traveler, wherever you tread, may you find stray Mora at your feet!

## Talk 10

Mualani: Amazing... look at all these beautiful stalls! ...I can arrange them however I want? Really!? Okay, lemme think...
Mualani: Let's put the Snug Saurian Lounger here... and a display for the night-time sunglasses over there, and... oh, we can't forget the Friendship Triangle Tandem Surfboard! It takes three people to ride it, and oh boy, is it a blast!
Mualani: These are all brand-new products I got in recently. See anything you like? Feel free to take your pick, it's on me!
