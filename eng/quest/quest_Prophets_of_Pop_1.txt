# Prophets of Pop


## Talk 1

Impatient Tribesperson: Bah. This record isn't anything special, either. Not an element of pop present, not even a "snap"!
Lillo: Well, it wasn't right anyway, taking the record without consent. You should return it.
Impatient Tribesperson: Seriously? You really have gone all soft and sentimental after working with that guy from Liyue.
Impatient Tribesperson: Besides, these don't sell anyway, so aren't I helping him up his sales count?
Impatient Tribesperson: Hah! The baby Saurians are enjoying it, though! Just look at 'em.
Lillo: Enough. Give me the record. I'll return it myself.
Impatient Tribesperson: ...You done yet? Or do you wanna fight?
Impatient Tribesperson: Just in time — My muscles could do with some stretching! Haven't had anything to use as practice lately, y'know?

## Talk 2

Milu Nui: Ah... My record... It was the original... The original!
Lillo: I'm very sorry. If there's anything I can do for you, please let me know...
Traveler: At least that wasn't the only record of yours...
Traveler: At least your music wasn't lost...
Milu Nui: Ah, forget it. And there's no way to restore something this shattered...
Milu Nui: Now that it's come to this, I just want to ask you a question...
Milu Nui: ...When you were listening to my record, did you think it was good?
Milu Nui: Not the "it'll be a hit amongst children and baby Saurians" sort of "good," but rather... in the "pop" sense, of having that pop spirit!
Milu Nui: Do you get what I mean? Did you get that feeling when listening to it?
Lillo: "Pop"? Well... Give me a moment, please...
Milu Nui: I mean, you must've sent the baby Saurians to snatch the record because of the deep spirit of pop within the music, didn't you?
Lillo: Hang on, please let me explain...
Lillo: We... never "ordered" the baby Saurians to snatch your record...
Lillo: They were drawn to your song of their own accord...
Milu Nui: Sorry?
Lillo: I mean to say that your songs are outstanding! Believe you me, the baby Saurians crowd around and run about every time I play your music. Never seen them happier!
Milu Nui: What? Ugh... But my record...
Lillo: I know how you feel, and I'm very sorry that such an excellent record was destroyed... Look, I'll help you record a new one! No one's stealing anything from you as long as I'm around — I guarantee it!
Milu Nui: Agh! My records aren't children's songs!

## Talk 3

Milu Nui: Did you manage to get my record back?
Traveler: Why did they snatch it, anyway?
Milu Nui: This... Well, it's a long story. I had just come up with a brand-new song. It sings of Spring, animals, and some other things...
Milu Nui: But after listening to it, that rascal Pakaa just dumped it straight into the children's section!
Milu Nui: He even had the nerve — the nerve! — to tell me how children and baby Saurians alike would adore such interesting, pithy tunes...
Milu Nui: Argh, dammit! I'm making real pop music over here! Not kids' songs!
Milu Nui: I was so beside myself with fury that I brought my record here, hoping to enjoy the music I'd made myself.
Milu Nui: But as I listened, a group of little Koholasaurs came crowding over.
Milu Nui: And before I knew it, they came charging in, snatched the record up with their teeth, and made off with it!
Milu Nui: I planned to give chase, but before I'd gone far, I discovered a gathering of people... and an angry lot they were, too!
Milu Nui: They might've been the ones who, coveting the music I'd made, directed the Koholasaurs to snag my record.
Milu Nui: And, and... Aaargh! I've had it with this! Please, good adventurer. I, Milu Nui, am begging you — please, help me get my record back!
Milu Nui: I—If you can... Please, try to keep my record as intact as you can. If not... My hard work over the last few days... It will all be in vain...

## Talk 4

Milu Nui: A brilliant battle, you two! I must say, you left quite the impression!
Milu Nui: Not only were you strong, but rhythmic. Why, you commanded that battle as a conductor would, baton in hand!
Milu Nui: Most importantly... The record is pretty much intact! Thanks to you, my friends can finally have a good night's sleep.
Milu Nui: Hmm... Wait, rhythm...? That's right! That's it! This is the rhythm I'm looking for!
Milu Nui: We could use it as the basis of the melody... No, I'll need an instrument with a lower sound profile...
Milu Nui: Anyway, these are for you, so please, take them! Come on, Lillo, let's head back to the tribe. I've got the inspiration I need!
Milu Nui: Agh, I shall have to write down all these rhythms, but where do I... Right, my clothes! I'll just pen 'em down here!

## Talk 5

Lillo: ...Put that record down. You might not have any etiquette, but show some respect for music, at least!

## Talk 6

Milu Nui: What exactly makes music "pop," exactly? This is so hard...

## Talk 7

Paimon: Oh no! The record's been broken too!

## Talk 8

Impatient Tribesperson: Hahaha! Someone new to test myself against, nice!

## Talk 9

Milu Nui: Ah, my record! Thank goodness, it's undamaged...
Lillo: I must apologize, Mr Milu Nui. My companion was the one who stole the record. Please accept my apologies on his behalf.
Traveler: The record is fine, and that's what matters.
Milu Nui: Right you are, right you are indeed. This one was the original record, too... Had it been damaged, I'd have found the nearest cliff to leap off of.
Milu Nui: ...And Lillo, brother, don't hang your head. The record's fine, so there's no point being petty about all this.
Milu Nui: Just answer one of my questions, and we'll call us even.
Lillo: Ask away. I will give you my best answer.
Milu Nui: When you were listening to my record, did you think it was good?
Milu Nui: Not the "it'll be a hit amongst children and baby Saurians" sort of "good," but rather... in the "pop" sense, of having that pop spirit!
Milu Nui: Do you get what I mean? Did you get that feeling when listening to it?
Lillo: "Pop"? Well... Give me a moment, please...
Milu Nui: I mean, you must've sent the baby Saurians to snatch the record because of the deep spirit of pop within the music, didn't you?
Lillo: Hang on, please let me explain...
Lillo: We... never "ordered" the baby Saurians to snatch your record...
Lillo: They were drawn to your song of their own accord...
Milu Nui: Sorry, what?
Lillo: I mean to say that your songs are outstanding! Believe you me, the baby Saurians crowd around and run about every time I play your music. Never seen them happier!
Milu Nui: What? Ugh... But my record...
Lillo: I know how you feel, having such a precious thing threatened like that...
Lillo: But look, I'm willing to work as your bodyguard for free, at least until you've released a new record. No one's stealing anything from you as long as I'm around — I guarantee it!
Milu Nui: Agh! My records aren't children's songs!

## Talk 10

Paimon: Phew. Thank goodness, it's undamaged...
Lillo: He must've been trying to lead us that way. Good thing you're so skilled.
Lillo: You're the ones Mr. Milu Nui asked to pick up the record, right? I've seen you talking to him, so I can guess your purpose.
Lillo: We're all People of the Springs. That guy... He used to be an alright sort. No clue where he's been getting all these bad habits lately.
Lillo: Ah yes, I forgot to introduce myself. You can call me Lillo — and again, I apologize for my... compatriot's behavior.
Lillo: ...Bah. I'm no good at formal conversation. If we were back with the tribe, I'd have treated you to a drink of water at least.
Traveler: Eh, I'm an adventurer. I'm used to this...
Lillo: Huh, that so? ...Y'know what, judging by your appearance, and how you acquitted yourself back there, you do seem to be an experienced adventurer.
Lillo: Anyway, never mind that. Let's clean our surroundings up. I'll pack the record so it doesn't get damaged again...
Lillo: Then I'll go with you to see Mr. Milu Nui. I must apologize to him in person.
Traveler: You've worked with people from Liyue before?
Lillo: That's right. I was once hired by a gentleman from Liyue. Accompanied him into the mountains to prospect for ore veins.
Lillo: I learned a lot from working with him — and when he left, he even gave me a name in his nation's style, "Yiyang."
Lillo: According to him, it means "to soar elegantly in the air." Not that I really understand where he got that, though...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Milu Nui: A brilliant battle, you two! I must say, you left quite the impression!
Milu Nui: Not only were you strong, but rhythmic. Why, you commanded that battle as a conductor would, baton in hand! But...
Milu Nui: ...Alas, the record has been utterly shattered — a dissonant note in an otherwise fabulous performance.
Milu Nui: May the Wayob protect those unfortunate friends of mine... But if nothing else, I can bring some of the record back to them.
Milu Nui: Anyway, these are for you, so please, take them! Come on, Lillo, let's head back to the tribe.
Milu Nui: *sigh* And with any luck, there won't be any fainting from my friends...

### Additional Talk 2

Milu Nui: Alright, Lillo. See those fellows there? They're our target for the day. Ready?
Traveler: Still gathering materials?
Traveler: How are things going with your record?
Milu Nui: #My oh my, if it isn't {NICKNAME}? Well, my record's almost ready — thanks to you, Lillo, and those musician friends of mine.
Milu Nui: This record combines the sounds of battle, shouts, and all manner of nature sounds... Truly a unique record!
Milu Nui: And we also managed to help our musician friends retrieve some of those involuntarily "borrowed" records in the process.
Milu Nui: All in all, I'd say that it's all gone rather smoothly thus far, and we've got a good thing going here.
Milu Nui: #Ah, yes. We were just about to retrieve another unreturned "borrowed" recording. If you're willing, {NICKNAME}, would you lend us a hand?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Milu Nui: Thank you! Once I finish this record, I'll make sure your name's first on the acknowledgments list!
Milu Nui: And as for you, Lillo... Would the second slot work?
Lillo: #It would be my honor. Come, {NICKNAME}. Let us go.
Traveler: Well, I guess this counts as helping you with that record, hmm?
Milu Nui: Why of course! Indeed, once I finish this record, I'll make sure your name's first on the acknowledgments list!
