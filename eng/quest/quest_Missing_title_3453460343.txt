Traveler: You must be very good at cooking?
Ryouko: Hehe, this client has a way with words. Even though I'm not famous, I'm confident in my abilities when it comes to the seasoning of Inazuma snacks.
Ryouko: Here, I've cooked a fresh batch. Would you like to try some they are still hot?
Ryouko: It seems like you're an outlander. If the food isn't to your tastes, I can specially adjust the seasoning just for you.
