# Scenes from Life in Meropide: The Art of Negotiation


## Talk 1

Paimon: The "Art of Negotiation"...? Hmph! Even the title is boring! Paimon's not interested in that... Huh?
Paimon: Eh? There's a note here? Hmm... "Go to the registration counter at the front desk to participate in the Coupon Cafeteria's internal satisfaction survey for a chance to win Coupon rewards..."
Paimon: Coupons... Whoa! See this? We can get Coupons! Paimon didn't expect something this good at all! Let's go!

## Talk 2

Paimon: The registration counter at the front desk... This is it! Let's try our luck!
Paimon: Hello, Ms. Monglane!
Monglane: ...
Paimon: (Whoa! She doesn't look like she's easy to get along with!)
Traveler: (Maybe the Art of Negotiation will work?)
Paimon: (That's right, we've got this book! Who knew it would come in handy here?)
Paimon: Let's see... Found it! "If you gain the initiative by showing your strength and overwhelm your opponent with an imposing manner..."
Paimon: This is it! Overwhelm the opponent by being imposing! Paimon gets it! Paimon just has to be louder, right?
Paimon: Hey! Ms. Monglane! Hello—
Monglane: ...I heard you. What can I do for you?
Paimon: Huh? It really worked!
Paimon: #Hehe, we're here for the satisfaction survey, Ms. Monglane! Er, Paimon means to say that she's here to accompany him.
Paimon: #(Don't worry, Traveler. We have this book. Paimon will sneak peeks at the book and tell you what to do! Anyway... Yeah! Just listen to Paimon!)
Monglane: Another one saw the notes in the books...
Paimon: Huh? Yeah, that's right!
Monglane: Just how many were...? Actually... Ugh, forget it. It's fine...
Monglane: Ahem, please wait a moment... Allow me to explain the rules. The survey has a total of five questions. Please answer them quickly and intuitively. Remember, you must answer them quickly.
Monglane: Do you understand? We can begin once you're ready.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Traveler: We're ready.
Paimon: (Whoa! Wait! Paimon is still flipping through the book...)
Monglane: Very good. Let's hurry up and begin then.

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: Please give me a moment to get ready.
Monglane: ...Oh. I see. Please be quick about it.
Paimon: (Hey... Why is she being so impatient...?)

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: We're ready.

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: Please give me a moment to get ready.
Monglane: *sigh* Please hurry up then.

### Additional Talk 6

Paimon: (Paimon is ready now! Do your worst!)
Monglane: Question one. Do you think it is reasonable to maintain the prices for the food in the Coupon Cafeteria at the current low level?
Paimon: (Hmm... How do we answer this? Let Paimon look it up... Found it! Let's try the universal formula.)
Paimon: (According to the book "I agree with your views, but..." can be used in any situation. Even an Abyss Mage would be willing to respond positively. It sounds really amazing.)
Traveler: Reasonable. Paimon quite likes it.
Paimon: Ah...? Paimon wouldn't touch that horrible stuff even if it was free!
Traveler: But what if our food budget runs out...?
Paimon: Hmm... When you put it like that... N—NO! Paimon would rather starve!
Monglane: *Cough* Excuse me.
Paimon: Huh?
Monglane: According to the rules, the survey must be answered quickly. Let's move on to the next question.
Paimon: F—Fine... Rules are rules...
Monglane: Question number two. Is adequate food available during dining hours in the Coupon Cafeteria?
Paimon: There's plenty of food... But it just tastes awful!
Traveler: Yeah, it has more Mint than grows on all of Teyvat.
Paimon: Paimon would rather just eat Mint directly...
Traveler: Really? Then you can have a Mint Salad today.
Paimon: No! Paimon doesn't want either of those! *sobs* Paimon wants Sweet Madame...
Monglane: Anyway... Can we get back to the survey? I'll just put it down as a yes.
Monglane: Ugh... This is so tiring. Let's move on to the next question.
Monglane: Before we move on to the third question, I'd like to remind you that this survey requires you to answer quickly. So...
Monglane: Now for the third question. Do you think the current randomized meal system is interesting?
Paimon: Pay more attention to the taste!
Monglane: I agree with your views, but... Doesn't randomized meals create the feeling of a pleasant surprise, of not knowing what you'll get next?
Paimon: That's true... When you put it like that, it does sound really interesting!
Traveler: Paimon...
Paimon: What? Miss Monglane made a lot of sense. It's very difficult to disagree!
Monglane: Ahem, please answer quickly.
Traveler: It's interesting, including the fortune slips.
Paimon: Yeah! Every meal comes with a fortune, and it's like drawing lots, it's really nice!
Paimon: "Hard work begets success!" Paimon thinks it's awesome!
Traveler: It is hard work to guide others.
Paimon: Hehe.
Monglane: ...
Monglane: Question number four. Do you think it's reasonable to sell addictive foods in the Coupon Cafeteria?
Paimon: (Huh? What? Why is she suddenly speaking faster?)
Paimon: (Gain the initiative? Steer the conversation? No! No! None of these seem correct. Maybe... We should go back to the universal formula...)
Traveler: (That's not quite right... These questions...)
Monglane: Ahem, please do not overthink it or engage in idle chatter. As I mentioned previously, please answer quickly and intuitively.
Traveler: It's very reasonable...
Monglane: Alright, thank you for your feedback. Now, it's time for the final question.
Paimon: Did she just completely ignore us? Are our answers not important at all!?
Monglane: Based on the answers you've just provided, are you satisfied with the current state of the Coupon Cafeteria?
Paimon: What were they again? Paimon can't remember all of them!
Monglane: It's alright, then I'll just write down that you're satisfied.
Paimon: Okay... But something doesn't feel quite right...
Monglane: I should probably mention that you will not receive any Coupons if you answer "no."
Paimon: That's way over the line!
Monglane: #Then what about you, sir?
Paimon: Don't ignore Paimon!
Traveler: Yes, I'm very satisfied.
Monglane: Very well. Thank you for your cooperation. Your support is our motivation to improve. Please sign here to claim your Coupons. The intelligent flying clockwork device by your side can sign for the Coupons too.
Paimon: Huh? Paimon gets some too!? But Paimon didn't even participate! Is that really okay? Wait! Paimon is Paimon! Not some intelligent flying clockwork device!
Monglane: Very well. Anyway, we respect all input, so everybody... er, all people and meka are eligible.
Paimon: Didn't you hear Paimon!? Paimon isn't a flying clockwork device! Paimon is Paimon! Don't ignore Paimon!
Monglane: Understood... Anyway, in order to help save your precious time, I can fill in the survey for you. Don't worry, the number of Coupons you'll receive won't change.
Monglane: I'm sure you'll be answering "satisfactory" to every question, right?
Paimon: Yes! Coupons!
Monglane: In that case, just sign here and leave the rest to me.
Paimon: Cool! This way we'll get the Coupons and save the trouble. Thanks, Ms. Monglane!
Monglane: Thank you for your support. Please take your Coupons and we hope you'll participate in the next survey.
Black Screen Text: After getting the Coupons, you and Paimon bid farewell to Ms. Monglane.
Paimon: In retrospect, Ms. Monglane didn't really care at all about our responses...
Traveler: The problem is with the questions themselves.
Paimon: Yeah, you're right. The questionnaire really was weird, and Ms. Monglane seemed so exhausted...
Traveler: The Art of Negotiation failed.
Paimon: Art of Negotiation, pshaw! Books like that are all completely useless after all!
Traveler: You're right, the book is the problem.
Paimon: Yeah, totally! So you also think the problem is with the book, right? But since we got some Coupons, Paimon will let it slide.
Traveler: Nope, the problem is with Paimon.
Paimon: Huh? But Paimon followed all the books instructions exactly! See, "Loud and proud..." It's all the book's fault after all!
Traveler: I agree with your views, but...
Paimon: Hey, don't you go mocking Paimon now! Hmph, some "Art of Negotiation"... It really was totally useless after all!
Traveler: No, I'm not satisfied at all.
Paimon: Wait, wait! No! Write down that we're satisfied! Even if just for the Coupons...
Monglane: You're satisfied, huh? Understood.
Traveler: I'm generally satisfied, but...
Traveler: It's not reasonable, because...
Traveler: I agree with your views, but...
Traveler: (Is this... Steering the conversation?)
Traveler: Not interesting, because I can't eat what I want to.
Paimon: It always tastes weird. The surprise isn't pleasant at all!
Traveler: I agree with your views, but...
Paimon: It would be great if you got a complimentary delicious meal every eighteen meals!
Traveler: Why eighteen?
Paimon: Paimon heard that from someone...
Paimon: It was something like... Uh... Because there's three meals each day, and there are six days before Sunday, that makes eighteen meals in six days...
Paimon: So there will be delicious food on the seventh day! And you'll be in a good mood every week!
Traveler: Not enough! Even Wolsey doesn't get to eat any!
Paimon: He just doesn't want to eat it!
Monglane: I see, so that means there isn't enough...
Traveler: I agree with your views, but...
Paimon: But we refuse to eat it.
Monglane: *sigh*... I know you've read the book... Anyway, I'll just put it down as a yes...
Traveler: Unreasonable, I want the prices to be raised!
Paimon: Huh!? Why!?
Traveler: Forget the best, we want the most expensive!
Paimon: What kind of crazy talk is that!?
Paimon: A—Are you alright...? You don't seem normal at all. Did you eat something strange?
Traveler: I agree with your views, but...
Monglane: But?
Paimon: #But there is room for improvement! If only it tasted just a little better! Don't you think so too, Traveler?
Paimon: Or... If Sweet Madame was available. Yeah! Paimon would happily eat here every day if you did that!
