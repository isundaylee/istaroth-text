# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Wanna chat?
Rena: Sure, but where should we start...?
Rena: I was just thinking that I should meet up with a friend at the opera house on my off day — we can watch an opera or a trial, either is fine with me.
Rena: I've been on duty at the harbor lately, and I've been inspecting machines on the regular, day in and day out — nothing special.
Rena: But thinking about it a different way, boring work might be meaningless, but at least it's safe.
Rena: If I were still dispatched to the Fontaine Research Institute for further studies in mechanical knowledge, I might no longer have legs to touch land, you know?
