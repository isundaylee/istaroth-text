Traveler: (Keep listening.)
Devitt: He knew then that he could never again leave that palace. He had heard of this noble's deeds — he was stingy, and loved to plunder. Seizing and hoarding consumed his every waking thought.
Devitt: But he was no heroic thief or great mage — he was simply a hatter, and hats could not help him deceive the guards nor vault the towering walls.
Devitt: And at that moment, the aggrieved hatter remembered the goddess's promise, and realized that it might be his lifeline. And so he pushed the window open and prayed in silence—
Devitt: "Dear Goddess, please help me escape from this cage. There are still so many out there waiting for me to make nice hats for them."
Devitt: "I want to be free to make hats for everyone — that's my wish."
Traveler: (Keep listening.)
Devitt: In the instant after he finished his wish, the hat in his hands leaped into the air, suddenly fastening itself to his head.
Devitt: His whole body floated up with that hat and was carried out the window, soaring high over the stunned guards, and over the heavily guarded walls.
Devitt: A rain of arrows pursued him, but they were turned aside gently by the wind. The flabbergasted guards could only watch as the hatmaker flew away from the manse.
Devitt: After that, none would again see that hatmaker in the city. His hat shop was demolished by the frustrated aristocrat.
Devitt: But the hatmaker's good neighbors knew that he was still working to make hats for the people.
Devitt: If one wanted to order a hat from him, you had to do so after midnight, writing your request on the bark of a tree using jam, before placing the bark and the payment for the hat on the highest chimney.
Devitt: Within a week, a beautiful hat bearing the scent of green grass would appear on your windowsill.
Devitt: And that was how everyone came to call him the "Flying Hatter."
Traveler: (Stop listening for now...)
