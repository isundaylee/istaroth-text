Traveler: I'd like to know about Yae Publishing House.
Kuroda: Yae Publishing House is founded by Lady Yae Miko, the Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine. We mainly sell Light Popular Novels, which are more commonly known as Light Novels.
Kuroda: As you can see, the first floor is the bookstore, where we sell the books that we have published.
Kuroda: You must be an outlander, right? In that case, I highly recommend our local light novels. These are the most popular with young people nowadays.
Kuroda: Even some outlander authors have started to follow the trend of writing light novels now. They've even submitted some drafts to us.
Kuroda: Many light novel fans from other islands have traveled all the way here to buy books. They even call it a pilgrimage... Haha, well, I guess light novels are just that popular, huh?
