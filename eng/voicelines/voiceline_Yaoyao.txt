# Yaoyao Voicelines

## Hello
Hello, I'm Yaoyao, a lowly disciple of the adeptus, Streetward Rambler. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance! If you encounter any difficulties outdoors... then lemme help you! Oh, by the way, I brought some Fried Radish Balls with me, help yourself! Don't eat too many, though — too much oily stuff is hard work for your body. If you're still hungry, I also brought a freshly washed radish and some vinegar, so I could make you a shredded radish salad if you want~

## Chat: Proverbs
"Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today!" C'mon, let's get a move on!

## Chat: Join In the Fun
Ooh, what's happening over there? Can we take a sneaky peek, huh? Can we?

## Chat: Adepti-Seeking
Why do so many people make such a big deal out of "seeking the adepti"? There's adepti everywhere! Isn't there?

## When It Rains
Hey, can you hear the frogs croaking? Hehe, silly frogs! They're singing along to the sound of the rain! Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit~

## When Thunder Strikes
Wh—Whaa! I—I'll cover your ears for you, a—and if you're scared, you can hold my hand.

## When It Snows
It's snowing, yay! Uh! First things first: You have to wrap up warm. Put your big fluffy coat on... uh-huh, and your woolly hat and scarf, yep— Ah-ah-ah! Don't forget your gloves. ...Good! Alright, let's go build a snowman!

## When the Sun Is Out
The weather's so nice. Let's go have a walk around the harbor!

## When the Wind Is Blowing
Ooh, it's getting windy. Be careful not to get blown away.

## Good Morning
Time to get up! Your breakfast is ready, so you'd better hurry... Uh, huh? You still wanna snooze a while? ...Well, okay — but five minutes and that's all, okay? Five minutes, and I'll be back to wake you up again. *sigh* I knew I should have sent you to bed earlier...

## Good Afternoon
Now, don't forget: You don't wanna nap right away after a big lunch, but you also mustn't go racing off on an adventure. You gotta wait for your food to go down, or you'll get a tummy-ache.

## Good Evening
Huh? You're going out again tonight? Hmm, what time do you plan on getting back? *sigh* Well, it's dark out, so be really careful...

## Good Night
Time for your bedtime story... Now, where did we get to last t—time... Ah, yes: "Ever since ancient times... the mighty and illuminated adepti have protected Liyue against evil. Among them, mmngh mmph..."

## About Yaoyao: The Liyue Docks
You know the docks in Liyue Harbor? There's always loads of people talking, shouting, laughing, it's great! Totally different from back home. It's so quiet there, you can hear the leaves falling on the grass. That's why I go to the docks whenever I'm free — you know, to see the new ships, new sights... and new toys!

## About Yaoyao: Eat Up, Wrap Up
They say "Give them clothes to wear, and they shall show you decency; fill their stomachs with grains, and they shall fill their minds with righteousness"... And that's why you have to eat a decent meal and dress right for the weather when you're out in the wild. ...Huh? Is that not what that saying means? Oh, okay, so... what DOES it mean?

## About Us: Polearm Training
It's not that I'm lazy, it's just the spear's too long for me, and it's so heavy that training with it is really hard work... Luckily, Master doesn't push me too hard.

## About Us: Worries
Have you been eating three meals a day? Also, do you have enough warm clothing? This cold spell's only going to get colder, you know. And anyway, are you sure it's not dangerous, adventuring all the time? Any new injuries I should know about? ...Ugh, you know what — forget that, just bring me along from now on. I can't have peace of mind knowing that you're out there braving the elements all day long...

## About the Vision
My Master's a Mighty and Illuminated Adeptus! She once told me that getting a Vision is a sign that the gods are pleased with you, but I don't think I've done anything special... I really wish I could talk to that god and see what she thinks about it!

## Something to Share
"Osial"? Oh, you mean that jumbo-sized octopus from the Sea of Clouds? Uh... not because I wanna eat it or anything, but... if you guys wanted to, you should definitely cook it through on the grill first... Oh, wait! I mean, you don't HAVE to grill it, but... I just think it would taste better that way...

## Interesting Things
I love finches! Whenever I go to play with Qiqi, I look out for them on my way there. And when I find them, I say hi! ♪ *whistle*~ ♪ ...Yep! "Good morning!" That's exactly what it means, well done!

## About Xiangling
Xiangling hasn't been, um... looking for strange ingredients lately, has she? She gave me a real fright last time. She said she was about to try some raw octopus from the Sea of Clouds. One of these days, she'll give herself an upset stomach — then what's she gonna do? 'Cause she definitely doesn't like taking Dr. Baizhu's medicine... Anyway, I got Master to try and talk some sense into her, too. Who knows what dangerous thing she'll be trying to eat next... *sigh*

## About Qiqi: Friends
Qiqi's my best friend! She forgets who I am sometimes, but I know she doesn't mean it... I just have to remind her to check her notebook, and she remembers me right away.

## About Qiqi: Forever
I once asked Dr. Baizhu in private if there's any way to cure her, and, um... But it doesn't matter. I'll probably have to keep reminding her who I am for my whole life, but that's okay.

## About Baizhu
Dr. Baizhu's prescriptions are pretty effective. They're bitter, that's for sure, but they always say that about medicine: "the bitter the better"! So I get it. Huh? Too bitter for you? Don't worry, I've got some Candied Dates here. One of these after you finish your medicine will take the taste away.

## About Ganyu
Ganyu always has a lot of work to do. I heard that one time, she was so tired she accidentally fell asleep on the grass. *sigh* I do worry about her, you know! Hmm, maybe... we could go do a "surprise inspection"! You know, check in and make sure she's taking care of herself. Oh! Uh... Wait a minute, I'll go get some of her favorite plants for her to eat...

## About Keqing
Keqing's a very thoughtful person, and she always does a good job of everything. She also makes sure to pay Master a visit at every festival... She's what you call a "bastion of piety." Or wait, maybe it's "paragon of propriety"? ...Well, anyway, I think I can learn a lot from her!

## About Yun Jin
Now, Yun Jin's really good at spear dancing, and her Liyue opera performances are very popular. Master even takes me to go see them sometimes. You won't find an empty seat when she's on stage... but, um... does anyone understand what she's singing about?

## About Beidou
Beidou's ship is amazing! If I hadn't promised Ganyu that I wouldn't go on board anymore, I know exactly where I'd set up my own little bed, hee-hee.

## About Shenhe
Shenhe's been away from the human world for years and years, so it's no wonder that she's still adjusting to life in Liyue Harbor. I'd love to help Ganyu take care of her... But how do I ask her in a way that won't make her feel uncomfortable?

## About Yanfei
Yanfei takes that huge legal codex everywhere, even when she comes to pay Master a visit on her days off. She's incredible! I don't know how she carries that heavy thing around all the time, and I can't imagine how much hard work it must be to read it...

## About Xianyun
When I went to look for Master the other day, I found her chatting with a very elegant-looking lady. She said her name was "Xianyun," but her hijinks didn't fool me! I could tell it was Aunty Cloud Retainer right away! I mean, Master looked like she was really happy to see her, so how could it be a stranger? Evidently, she was an old friend!

## More About Yaoyao: I
You wanna know where I'm from? Well, my parents are hermits who live up in the mountains... Uh, I guess you could say that I'm from Qingce Village?

## More About Yaoyao: II
My family makes a living by growing precious medicinal herbs. My parents often get so busy that they forget about the housework, and sometimes they even forget to eat! Tsk, isn't that awful? Good thing they've got me to look after them.

## More About Yaoyao: III
I grew up in the mountains, so the flowers, trees, plants, and animals are all my friends! Oh — would you like to chat with the finches? I can take you to them, and I can also help translate for you. Come on, it'll be fun~! But first, let's get some grains as a gift for them.

## More About Yaoyao: IV
There are adepti everywhere in Liyue. I've met loads of them! Aunty Cloud Retainer, Uncle Mountain Shaper... But Aunty Cloud Retainer's my favorite! She's given me all kinds of adepti gadgets, and taught me all about how to use them. I've learned so much from her!

## More About Yaoyao: V
After I met Master, she said that the path of my fate had intersected with the adepti way, and took me on as her disciple. To be honest with you, I didn't even understand what she meant by that. But it's been so much fun, getting to hang out with everybody, listening to Master tell stories, and sneakily slacking off with Xiangling... And we also get to help the people of Liyue Harbor out a lot. I really love it!

## Yaoyao's Hobbies
It is said that joy hides just beyond the horizon, and bliss is as fleeting as the setting sun! So, whenever I notice anything fun going on, I always gotta go check it out... and you never know, maybe I'll find something I can help with.

## Yaoyao's Troubles
Oof, spear training is really kinda boring... Maybe I'll go play with Yuegui for a little bit, then come back and do some more training after I've had a break...

## Favorite Food
Qingce Stir Fry, Come and Get It, boiled fish... Lots of Liyue dishes are not only delicious, they also turn mealtimes into a big event. Hmm? You like them too? That's great! You'll have to come over for dinner sometime, I'll cook for you! Don't worry, I've helped Xiangling in the kitchen before, so it's safe to say that I come from good stock where food is concerned!

## Least Favorite Food
One time, Shenhe ate too many Qingxin in one go and she was sick for days! And that's why I've got to take care of myself and not eat raw Qingxin. Hmm? How did I know about that? Aunty Cloud Retainer told me!

## Receiving a Gift: I
This is amazing! It tastes just like Xiangling's cooking. It's like they say: The apple didn't fall far from the tree, mmm... Wait, no, two peas in a pod! You two are like two peas in a pod. Hehe, I'm always mincing up my words when I get too excited.

## Receiving a Gift: II
Sooo tasty! Next time you cook, lemme come too! I can help~

## Receiving a Gift: III
...Uh, do you always eat this kind of stuff? Maybe you should let me cook for you instead! If you're not eating well and you're still going out adventuring every day, one of these days you're gonna wear yourself out...

## Birthday
This is the day of your birth, and as is tradition, this calls for a bowl of longevity noodles. I got Xiangling to teach me how to make it, and I managed to put all the noodles in the water without breaking a single one! I also put a big plump egg in there, hee-hee! Come on, let's go, you've got to eat it before it goes cold. Wishing you a happy, healthy birthday and a long and prosperous life.

## Feelings About Ascension: Intro
Eh? Did my spear just get lighter? ...It'd be great if it could get a little shorter, too...

## Feelings About Ascension: Building Up
Wow! I might even be able to lift Xiangling's spear now! Yay~ Oh, I really wanna tell Master the good news!

## Feelings About Ascension: Climax
Hehe, people always say "perseverance is a virtue," and I guess I know what they mean now! ...Hmm? "Patience is a virtue"? But... isn't patience the enemy of progress?

## Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion
Huh. So that's what it feels like to be fussed over... Well, any growing or changing I've done is all thanks to you! And you know what they say — "treat other people the way you want them to treat you." So it's my turn to keep you safe and sound now!!
