Imena: The documents have been very clearly organized. I won't need to do any more, I think.

## Talk

Traveler: What sorts of documents?
Imena: Ah, it's some communications between the Fortress of Meropide and the Palais Mermonia. I'm in charge of sorting them out before handing them over to the Chief Justice.
Imena: To be honest, the documents from the Fortress have always been perfect. I just need to go down, come back up, and hand them in.
Imena: Sometimes I can even get a nice meal at the Coupon Cafeteria over there â€” no wonder a retired senior of mine said that you couldn't go wrong with this job.

Traveler: See you.
Imena: See you. I hope everything goes well with you too.
