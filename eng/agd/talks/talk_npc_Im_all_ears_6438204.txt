Traveler: I'm all ears.
Gregor: When I got my offer and saw the Grand Sage's signature, I was so proud of myself. Thought it was the proof of his recognition.
Gregor: But later I found that everyone has received the same acceptance letter with his signature on it! What a fool I was to believe that the Grand Sage saw something special in me.
Gregor: But Sumeru is indeed different from Mondstadt. People here are more serious but less romantic.
Gregor: For example, my Darshan, Haravatat, focuses on linguistics, but we seldom discuss literature. Instead, we spend a lot of time studying syntax and structure.
Gregor: But I heard that some people have been trying to organize a light novel society. Although they're not from the Akademiya, it more or less shows that the people of Sumeru aren't all so stiff and rigid.
