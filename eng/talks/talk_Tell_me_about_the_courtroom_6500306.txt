Traveler: Tell me about the courtroom...
Esteban: You won't find any courtrooms here. Criminal cases are heard in the Opera Epiclese on Erinnyes.
Esteban: Hmm... I always feel something's missing without the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale and Lady Furina. But the court is hearing cases as usual.
Esteban: The atmosphere of the court won't affect the fairness of the proceedings.
Esteban: Well, I'm just a stenographer, so that's what I do â€” record the proceedings within the opera house.
