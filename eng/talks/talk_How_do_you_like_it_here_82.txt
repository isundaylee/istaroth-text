# Talk Dialog

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Yun Jin: Yes, you needn't worry. Everything here seems to be in good order, not to mention the delightful scenery. I think I will have no issue residing in such a pleasant place.
Yun Jin: I have a habit of going to an open space every morning to rehearse my voice.
Yun Jin: It can be difficult to find a suitable place where my singing won't disturb anyone in Liyue Harbor, but here that is not a problem at all.
Traveler: "Rehearse your voice"? Every day?
Yun Jin: Yes. Why, that's a fundamental part of anyone's routine in my profession.
Yun Jin: If you skip a day, only you will know. But if you skip three days, the whole audience will know. A master never forgets the fundamentals of practicing.
Yun Jin: *sigh* Alright, I can see it written on your face already, "That sounds exhausting"... As a matter of fact, I don't feel that way at all, quite the opposite, really.
Yun Jin: To fully deliver the elegance of Liyue opera to the audience, we must strive for excellence, properly performing every subtlety in the story.
Yun Jin: To be completely honest, I find great enjoyment in my hours of practice.
Traveler: I understand.
Yun Jin: Great. Thank you for your kind understanding.
Traveler: Shall I accompany you while you rehearse?
Yun Jin: Haha, how kind. I do appreciate your courtesy.
Yun Jin: However, in my practice routine, I tend to go over my whole repertoire, both singing and reciting... I may suddenly be acting dreadfully mournful one moment, and then practicing a hysterical laugh the next... I fear such a kaleidoscope of outright emotion may scare you.
Yun Jin: I would much prefer to offer you a complete and fully prepared opera instead.
