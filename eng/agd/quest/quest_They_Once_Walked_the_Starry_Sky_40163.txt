# They Once Walked the Starry Sky


## Talk 1

Paimon: Morning! Guess everything that happened yesterday wasn't just a dream, then...
Paimon: Well, it's time for our next fairytale adventure! We should head to the station Grandpa Almond told us about...

## Talk 2

Almond: Get up, Cedule! Time to get to work, you lazybones!
Cedule: Uh... Can't... can't remember how to call the train. Just lemme sleep a little longer, then I'm sure I'll remember...
Almond: Don't try to pull one over on me, young man! Your Fading Disorder has been cured! I saw you chugging cup after cup of Magic Tonic in the Tavern last night.
Cedule: Uh... You must be mistaken, Grandpa Almond. That guy definitely wasn't me...
Almond: Oh, you remember my name now, do you? Then it seems like you're all better — you had no idea who I was when you were fading. Now, enough of your nonsense, get up! The Fairy and her friends are going to be here any second!
Cedule: Alright, I'm up, I'm up... The Maritime Express should be here soon.
Almond: Hmph, that's more like it. Lie there any longer and you'll start gathering dust!
Paimon: Is everything okay?
Almond: #The Hero, his pixie companion, and the Forest Fairy! I didn't know you were already here. Oh, merciful macadamias... I'm sorry you had to see that.
Paimon: It's alright! Paimon knows the feeling! Who doesn't want to sleep in first thing in the morning?
Nilou: Does the Maritime Express run out of Constellation Metropole?
Almond: Yes. Each train needs a conductor to operate, and the conductors are always from the capital. The more difficult maneuvers are a little too complicated when you're made of paper.
Paimon: Oh... so you mean, the people of Constellation Metropole aren't origami animals like you?
Almond: Well, the city welcomes visitors from all over the world, so you're bound to run into some Forest-dwellers there. But yes, generally speaking, the residents of Constellation Metropole look quite different from us.
Almond: Ah, you'll see for yourself soon enough... Here comes the train.
Wheel: Pleasure to meet you, everyone. My name is Wheel, and I'll be the conductor for your journey today. I'm assuming you're the ones who called the train?
Paimon: Whoa... it's a little toy man!
Almond: Yes, we called the train. The Hero and the Forest Fairy need a ride to Constellation Metropole.
Wheel: The... The Hero and the Forest Fairy!? The ones from the prophecy?
Wheel: Wh—Why didn't you say so earlier? We could've prepared a far more luxurious train... I—I'll just go back and get a better one!
Nilou: That's okay, Mr. Wheel. We're trying to get to the city as fast as possible. We just need you to get us across the sea. In your capable hands, I'm sure we'll get there in no time!
Wheel: O—Of course, my lady. It would be an honor!
Wheel: Well then, all aboard! Sit anywhere you like. We'll get a stunning view of Simulanka no matter where you're seated!
Kirara (???): Hehehe... Breakfast...
Paimon: Hmm? Did one of you just say something?
Traveler: Not me...
Nilou: Wasn't me, either.
Kirara (???): Breakfast... No, come back...
Nilou: Hmm... Sounds like the voice is coming from inside the train.
Kirara: Hehe... Fish... Chicken drumsticks... Got ya...
Paimon: What the... What's Kirara doing here!?
Traveler: Eating her own tail, apparently...
Kirara: Nom nom meow...
Nilou: Is she a friend of yours?
Paimon: Oh, let Paimon introduce you... This is Kirara, she's— Wait, actually, maybe we should wake her up first.
Kirara: Meow... So noisy... Mrrow!? Is it morning already...?
Traveler: Good meowning.
Kirara: #Hm, morning... Huh? Huuuuuuh!? Traveler! Paimon! It's... It's you!
Kirara: Which means... Oh, thank goodness! It was all a dream after all! Ehehehe, gotta hand it to my imagination, it all felt super real! There were these toy people, but they were alive, and they could talk...
Wheel: Ahem... Madame, sleeping overnight in the train car is prohibited...
Kirara: Mrrow!? It... It wasn't just a dream?
Paimon: It's alright, Kirara... Apparently, we're in a world called "Simulanka." We got here yesterday, too.
Kirara: Simulanka? So, that's what it's called. I spent all day yesterday wandering around this one city... The toy people called it Constellation Metropole. I was trying to find a way to get back home.
Kirara: I was seriously starting to think I'd gotten on the bad side of some great youkai, and gotten swallowed whole...
Nilou: Ah... I take it you're Inazuman, then, Miss Kirara?
Paimon: She sure is! But, uh... Kirara, here, is kinda special. Let Paimon introduce you for real this time. Kirara is a nekomata from Inazuma. She works as a courier for Komaniya Express.
Nilou: Ah, nice to meet you! I'm Nilou, a member of Zubayr Theater. You can usually find us performing in Sumeru City's Grand Bazaar. Right now, though... I suppose I should introduce myself as the Fairy of the Forest of Blessings!
Kirara: Oh, you're Nilou! I've heard a lot about you from my deliveries in Sumeru. I even saw one of your performances back in the day! You're an amazing dancer. But, uh, did you say you were a... Forest Fairy?
Paimon: Yeah, that's her new identity here in Simulanka. Speaking of new identities, looks like you've got a new outfit yourself, Kirara...
Kirara: Yeah, I know! It confused the heck out of me yesterday... I just woke up in a set of brand-new clothes I'd never seen before.
Paimon: That must mean you have a big part to play here, too!
Traveler: As a cat burglar?
Kirara: I think Miss Lynette would be better suited to that role, being a magician and all...
Nilou: Did you by any chance hear a voice speaking to you before you got here, Miss Kirara?
Kirara: A voice... Oh, yeah, I did hear something, but I was so freaked out, my tails got all tangled. So I... didn't catch much of what was said, hehe...
Chestnut: S—S—Sorry for the interruption...
Chestnut: B—But this nekomata friend of yours... She doesn't eat hamsters, does she?
Firecracker: O—Or frogs...?
Kirara: Oh, no need to worry, little guys! I would never do something like that! Well, unless I'd been out in the wild too long without anything to eat. Huh, speaking of eating, I am getting a little hungry...
Firecracker (Crowd): ...!
Cedule: ...!
Almond: Ahem! Where are your manners, everyone!? This young lady is a trusted friend of our esteemed Hero!
Almond: Now, I know a fear of felines is etched into us with ink, but I'm certain Miss Nekomata-in-Boots here means us no harm!
Cedule: Sure looks like you're keeping your distance, though, Grandpa Almond...
Kirara: You all have nothing to fear, I promise! I met some origami animals in Constellation Metropole yesterday, and I even made sure to retract my claws so I didn't hurt them by accident.
Kirara: Plus, you all look just about as tasty as the cardboard boxes I deliver, haha... Uhh, not that I'd try to eat you even if you did look tasty! Promise!
Almond: ...Please excuse us, Ma'am. It's just an unconscious reaction.
Wheel: Ahem, dear passengers... It's almost time for us to depart...
Paimon: Oh yeah, that. Whoops, this turned into a pretty long conversation, didn't it... Alright, let's get on the train! You coming with us, Kirara?
Kirara: Mhm, I'll ride with you to the next stop. There's a place near the Metropole that caught my eye yesterday, so I want to go explore it today.
Almond: Then all that remains for me to say is: On behalf of the Forest of Blessings, thank you, once again, for all you've done for us.
Almond: May the Goddess of Fate be with you and bless your journey, Madame Fairy, Miss Nekomata-in-Boots, and our brave Heroes.
Almond: Please do visit us in the Forest of Blessings again, once peace has returned to this land!
Paimon: We will! We'll definitely meet again!
Nilou: Take care, Grandpa Almond!
Traveler: As a Nekomata-in-Boots?
Kirara: Is... Is that a thing? I guess I am wearing a pair of boots, but still...

## Talk 3

Wheel: Here we are! Constellation Metropole is right over there. It's a short walk from here to the Gear Sky Ladder, which will take you right to Metropole Square. Thank you again for choosing the Maritime Express!
Nilou: Great. And thanks to you for a smooth and pleasant journey, Mr. Wheel.
Kirara: The train cars were comfortable and spacious, and I had a great night's sleep. I'll definitely be back!
Wheel: Um... As you wish, Ma'am.
Paimon: Where should we go next? Is that place you wanted to check out nearby?
Kirara: Mhm, I took a walk around yesterday and it felt like there was something weird about it. So I think I'll indulge my curiosity and go investigate.
Nilou: Want us to come with you?
Kirara: It's okay — you guys go ahead and visit the Metropole for now. Hopefully that's where you'll be able to find out some more about this world.
Kirara: I pretty much explored the whole place from the rooftops yesterday, but for some reason, this is the place that caught my attention.
Kirara: Hehe, you know what I mean, right? Like, when you get a stone stuck in your claw, or something. It keeps nagging you to dig it out, and you can't focus on anything else until you do.
Kirara: But don't worry — if you run into any trouble, I'll be there faster than you can say "Gold-Level Courier of the Komaniya Express"!
Paimon: Okay, fair enough. We'll head to the Metropole then. Guess this is where we say bye for now.
Traveler: Stay safe, Kirara.
Kirara: Mhm! Don't worry about me — let's not forget I'm a youkai!

## Talk 4

Bleufond: Help me! Help... Oh Goddess of Prophecy above, could you kind souls please help us?
Paimon: What happened here? Why are you all suspended in midair...?
Bleufond: I mean, being stuck in midair still beats falling to the ground and being smashed into a pile of blocks... Ugh, I told him to be careful, but— No, never mind, now's not the time for that.
Bleufond: My good friends, could I trouble you to turn the *clockwork key* over there? I'll explain everything in a bit.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Onwards and upwards... Let's head to that Gear Sky Ladder thing that Wheel mentioned.

## Talk 6

Navia: This way, Miss Nilou. After you!
Nilou: Thank you, Miss Navia, but it's fine... I don't mind not riding the Aerial Express...
Navia: What is it? Are you scared of heights?
Nilou: Huh? No, it's not that, it's just...
Navia: Then you'll be fine! If you feel scared, just hold onto my hand. And if you feel really scared... Hold onto both of them!
Navia: You're never gonna see something like this again, why not just go for it? Live in the moment, have some fun!
Nilou: Yeah... Yeah, you're right!
Nilou: Big circle, and exhale... Alright, I'm ready. Let's go!

## Talk 7

Bleufond (???): Help me! Somebody, please!
Nilou: Over there! Somebody needs our help!

## Talk 8

Paimon: Huh? What's this?
Navia: Wait, this looks like the *star* I found earlier. I told the guards to place it near the Goddess Statue... Maybe they ran into some trouble up there.
Navia: Guess we'd better hurry.

## Talk 9

Montagne: Drat... I can't move...
Navia: What happened?
Montagne: Your Majesty! This... conservative radical, he attacked us! He threw the star from the Astral Garden, and even stole the Magic Thread linking the Oracle Pillars...
Montagne: But just as we were about to arrest him, the Goddess's magic activated, and now we can't move...
Olivier: No! Nobody touch the celestial gear!
Paimon: What's an "Oracle Pillar"?
Navia: You need to use it to pray to the Goddess... I'll explain later — first, let's help these guys!

## Talk 10

Paimon: Hey! He's getting away!
Montagne: Halt!
Navia: It's okay! Let him go.
Montagne: But... Your Majesty!
Navia: Even if we catch up to him now, we won't be able to change his mind, much less quell the fear that many others like him are feeling. All it would do is turn him further against us.
Montagne: ...Understood, Your Majesty.
Montagne: Also, this is the Magic Thread he was holding, from the Oracle Pillars. Your Majesty, what should we...
Navia: #Mhm, you can give it to Traveler over there. They seem to have some questions that they'd like to ask the Goddess.
Montagne: Yes, Your Majesty.
Paimon: Um... So what do we do with this, exactly?
Navia: See those Oracle Pillars over there? Just use the Magic Thread to *connect them together in a specific pattern*, and the Goddess of Prophecy will answer your prayers.
Paimon: Oh, sounds easy enough. Let's give it a try!

## Talk 11

Nilou: ...It worked!
"B" (Statue of the Goddess of Prophecy): ...
"B" (Statue of the Goddess of Prophecy): ...To which course of fate do you seek answers, my child of Simulanka?
Traveler: Ask how to leave this world
"B" (Statue of the Goddess of Prophecy): ...
Nilou: So, Miss Navia was right... The Goddess of Prophecy didn't tell us anything about the future.
Paimon: Fair enough... Guess we'll just have to play it by ear.
Traveler: If we want to push the celestial gear...
Navia: Then first, we have to restore the sky back to its original state by putting the stars back in their positions. Let me do a quick count...
Navia: Alright! Adding in the ones we picked up on the way here, I think that's all of them! Let's go hang these stars back up in the sky!
Paimon: In the sky...? How do we get up there?
Navia: Hehe, I got us covered! We will, of course, be taking... the Aerial Express!
Paimon: Is that a flying train!?
Navia: Hey, you already took a train that runs on water. Is a flying train really that much weirder?
Paimon: ...Well, at least the Maritime Express still runs on a track!
Navia: Oh, c'mon, don't worry about it! This train has been blessed by the Goddess of Prophecy. Its whole purpose is to protect the Metropole's skies.
Navia: It took me a lot of effort to find it, you know... I don't think anyone's used it in, like... a hundred years?
Paimon: A hundred years!? Are you sure it's safe? Let's not forget that the Goddess of Prophecy's magic has been going haywire recently...
Navia: Well... It's not like we have any other options. Unless you wanna do the honors, Paimon? Fancy flying up there on your own?
Paimon: Nooo thank you! It's way too high up... Wait, Nilou, you've got a feel for how magic works here. Can you do your thing and sense if this train is the real deal?
Nilou: I can try... Hmm... Yes, I can sense traces of magic, but it's different from the kind I felt in the Forest. So... I don't know.
Paimon: Okay, fine... Guess there's only one way to find out.
Navia: That's the spirit! I'll come with you. Miss Nilou, will you be joining us?
Nilou: I think I'll stay behind. That way, if something does go wrong, you'll have someone on the ground to get you some help.
Paimon: That makes sense! If the train does break down, you can make us a giant origami crane to come bail us out! ...Or if a crane's too difficult, a Finch could work!
Traveler: Ask how to defeat the dragon
"B" (Statue of the Goddess of Prophecy): The Hero from another world, supported by their companions, shall restore peace to this world...
Traveler: Ask about Simulanka's future
"B" (Statue of the Goddess of Prophecy): ...
Traveler: Ask how to resolve the Metropole's crisis
"B" (Statue of the Goddess of Prophecy): ...Go, and push the gear that connects up to the starry sky. When that time comes, I shall dance, and return the tracks beneath my people's feet back to the stars in the sky.
Traveler: I have no more questions.

## Talk 12

Navia: How are you doing? Found them all?
Traveler: Yep, here they are.
Traveler: I need some more time...
Navia: Sure, no worries. I'll be right here, so just come find me once you've retrieved them. I'm counting on you!

## Talk 13

Nilou: ...It worked!
"B" (Statue of the Goddess of Prophecy): ...
"B" (Statue of the Goddess of Prophecy): ...To which course of fate do you seek answers, my child of Simulanka?
Traveler: Ask how to leave this world
Traveler: Ask how to defeat the dragon
Traveler: Ask about Simulanka's future
Traveler: Ask how to resolve the Metropole's crisis
Traveler: I have no more questions.
"B" (Statue of the Goddess of Prophecy): ...
"B" (Statue of the Goddess of Prophecy): The Hero from another world, supported by their companions, shall restore peace to this world...
"B" (Statue of the Goddess of Prophecy): ...
"B" (Statue of the Goddess of Prophecy): ...Go, and push the gear that connects up to the starry sky. When that time comes, I shall dance, and return the tracks beneath my people's feet back to the stars in the sky.
Nilou: So, Miss Navia was right... The Goddess of Prophecy didn't tell us anything about the future.
Paimon: Fair enough... Guess we'll just have to play it by ear.
Traveler: If we want to push the celestial gear...
Navia: Then first, we have to restore the sky back to its original state by putting the stars back in their positions. But it looks like we haven't recovered all the lost stars yet.
Nilou: Well, at least we know what we're looking for now. We just need to keep going. That said... the Metropole is huge, where do we even start?
Navia: Oh, that's the easy part. I already compiled a list of the lost stars' locations based on eyewitness reports from across the city. Here you go, they should all be marked.
Navia: Would you mind going around and fetching them for me? I have a few other things to take care of.
Paimon: You got it! We'll be back in no time.
Navia: Awesome. In that case, meet me back here once you've found *them all*.

## Talk 14

Navia: How are you doing? Found them all?
Traveler: Yep, here they are.
Navia: Wow, you guys are efficient! Now, let's go hang 'em up in the sky!
Paimon: In the sky...? How do we get up there?
Navia: Hehe, I got us covered! We will, of course, be taking... the Aerial Express!
Paimon: Is that a flying train!?
Navia: Hey, you already took a train that runs on water. Is a flying train really that much weirder?
Paimon: ...Well, at least the Maritime Express still runs on a track!

Paimon: That makes sense! If the train does break down, you can make us a giant origami crane to come bail us out! ...Or if a crane's too difficult, a Finch could work!

## Talk 15

Bizerte: Captain, do you need help with anything?
Montagne: Why do you ask?
Bizerte: Because Her Majesty the King, the revered "Boss" herself, has personally advised me to help the people around me.
Bizerte: And, well... You're around me. You're right here. Right there.
Montagne: ...
Bizerte: ...Sorry, that was just me trying to liven things up a little, ahem... Anyway, I think we should head out and see if the residents of the city need our assistance.
Montagne: Good idea. I will lead the way.

## Talk 16

Nilou: Great job! It looked like it all went smoothly.
Navia: Yeah! And it was an absolute blast, too. You gotta ride with us next time, Miss Nilou!
Nilou: Huh? Ah, I'm okay, thanks...
Montagne: Halt! What do you think you're doing!?
Olivier: Get out of my way!
Navia: What's going on?
Montagne: Your Majesty, they're...
Olivier: Let us through!
Montagne: Stay back!
Navia: It's okay. Let them through.
Olivier: ...
Olivier: Y—Your Majesty... Could we please ask you.... not to turn the gear that connects up to the sky?
Navia: And why is that?
Olivier: ...As you have seen, the Goddess's gift is very important to us. It keeps us from harm, and protects our very lives.
Bizerte: Some of us... we just aren't ready to lose that protection.
Navia: ...I see. I understand.
Bizerte: Huh? Y—Your Majesty... Do you mean...
Navia: I won't turn that gear... Not until you're ready.
Olivier: ...What?
Navia: I've said before that the Metropole belongs to the people, and they should have the right to decide its future.
Bizerte: ...
Navia: But let me ask you this: How do you plan to solve the issues we are currently facing?
Olivier: Well, we'll start by rescuing the people that have gotten stuck! And then... we'll find a way to figure out the true cause of this crisis!
Navia: And have you made any headway on that? The true cause, I mean?
Bizerte: ...Unfortunately not.
Olivier: Hey! You little...!
Bizerte: I'm sorry, my friend, but it's the truth...
Navia: You have friends and family that have been affected, don't you? That have gotten stuck?
Olivier: ...
Navia: ...I understand your concerns. But if we let this drag on for much longer, the situation may well get worse. More and more people will be frozen by the Goddess's magic.
Olivier: Yes, but... if we turn that gear now, all the tracks in this city will disappear!
Navia: I know this is a hard decision to make. But have you ever thought about why the Goddess might have made things this way in the first place?
Bizerte: Uh...?
Navia: Why do you think she might decide to take back her gift, and stop revealing further prophecies about the future?
Olivier: Are you saying... She has abandoned us?
Navia: No. Quite the opposite, in fact.
Olivier: ...What do you mean?
Navia: The Goddess dearly loves this world and all the people of Simulanka. And because she loves you so much... she wants you to be able to choose your own path.
Bizerte: ...
Navia: Every parent hopes their child will have a happy and carefree life. But if they're overprotective, then all they'll manage to do is keep their child trapped.
Navia: If a mother bird lets her baby ride on her wings for too long, her child will never learn how to fly. Perhaps the Goddess of Prophecy has always known that one day... she'll have to let go.
Navia: Children can only become independent if they're allowed to form their own opinions, make their own decisions, and deal with the consequences on their own. Only then will they be able to continue their journey alone, even after their parents are gone.
Bizerte: ...But, we've relied on the Goddess's protection for so long... We don't know what it's like to go it alone. We don't know if we have what it takes.
Navia: Are you kidding me? I think you've proven yourselves more than capable of that.
Bizerte: What do you mean...?
Navia: You made a call in a time of crisis, and you've come all this way to talk to me. Even the guards couldn't stop you. That must have taken a lot of courage!
Bizerte: But... We only did it because we were scared...
Navia: Why you set out on the journey doesn't matter. What matters is that you've proven you can choose your own path.
Bizerte: ...
Bizerte: ...My friend, I fear our King is right. It is time for us to face our fears.
Olivier: What!? But... But we...
Bizerte: We can't go on living like this, living in fear! Look at what it's driven you to do... You threw away a star personally created by the Goddess of Prophecy herself!
Olivier: ...
Bizerte: You once revered her more than any of us. And I think the King is right — she hasn't abandoned us. So... why don't we put our trust in her one more time?
Olivier: ...
Olivier: ...I don't care anymore! Do what you want!
Paimon: Ah... He left...
Bizerte: I'm sorry about my friend... That's just how he is. Always had a terrible temper. Please accept my apology for his impudent behavior.
Nilou: Is it just me, or... has he accepted the Goddess's prophecy?
Bizerte: I think so. Not that you'll ever hear him admit it out loud.
Bizerte: Your Majesty... Please, turn the gear that connects up to the sky.
Navia: So you've made up your mind? About giving up the Goddess's gift?
Bizerte: Yes, I've made up my mind. But maybe losing the gift isn't what this is about anymore. Because we've gained something, too... you have given us courage.
Navia: Hehe, well said. I am proud of your decision!
Navia: Now, gather around, everyone, and join me as we make the night sky of this wonderful city turn once more!

## Talk 17

Nilou: So the stars hanging in the sky... they're music notes!
Paimon: This entire Metropole is a huge music box... That's incredible!
Bizerte: ...
Navia: How do you feel?
Bizerte: ...A little scared and uncertain, but for some reason, I feel a lot more at ease. It's as if... some kind of huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders.
Navia: Figured out any next steps?
Bizerte: To be honest, not really... But maybe I can start by having a heart to heart with that stubborn friend of mine.
Navia: I have an idea! If you don't know what to do, why don't you start by helping the people around you?
Bizerte: ...You mean, the people who got stuck because of the Goddess's magic?
Navia: I mean anyone and everyone who needs your help! By helping others, you'll eventually find your own path. Trust me, I have experience in this!
Bizerte: ...What kind of experience, Your Majesty?
Navia: Hmm... Ah yes, we'll need a formal organization with a catchy name before we go out and start helping people... Why don't we call it the Spina di Rosula?
Bizerte: Spina... di Rosula?
Navia: Ooh, or even: the Spina di Rosula di Simulanka! Yeah, that's catchy!
Paimon: Wow, big expansion for the Spina... moving into other worlds now!
Bizerte: Spina di Rosula... Haha, I like it! It's a great name. Let's do as Your Majesty suggests!
Navia: Well then, how about I appoint you as the head of the Spina in Simulanka? While I'm off fighting the dragon with the other heroes, it'll be your responsibility to work with the guards and take good care of the people in the Metropole.
Montagne: What? You're planning on fighting the dragon!? But... No, Your Majesty, you must reconsider!
Bizerte: He's right! Your Majesty, you can't!
Paimon: How are you two on the same side all of a sudden...
Bizerte: Perhaps Your Majesty is unaware of this... The great dragon suddenly broke out from the toytanium mines one day, and tore *the end of the world* to pieces.
Bizerte: After that, it spat out a strange fog that surrounded a whole island. No one knows what lies beyond the fog, and no one knows what has become of that poor island...
Montagne: Before Your Majesty arrived, we dispatched many soldiers to fight the dragon, but... none came back alive.
Paimon: Yikes, sounds worse than we thought...
Navia: Isn't that all the more reason for us to go? There could still be guards trapped there, waiting for someone to rescue them!
Nilou: King Navia is right. We cannot simply stand by and watch as the people of this world suffer.
Montagne: ...
Montagne: Very well. Though I have not served by your side for very long, Your Majesty, two days is enough for me to have learned that once your mind is set, any attempts to change it are futile.
Navia: Haha! You're a pretty good judge of character.
Paimon: Um... He probably didn't mean that as a compliment...
Montagne: Since you're serious about this, I won't try and stop you... There's only one way to reach the end of the world, and that's by taking the Maritime Express.
Nilou: Oh, right! So there's a line going there too?
Montagne: Yes. It was originally built to serve the workers commuting to the toytanium mines, but it has been abandoned since the dragon attack.
Montagne: I'll tell the conductor to wait for you at the platform *by the side gate of the Metropole*, first thing tomorrow morning. You are embarking on an extremely dangerous adventure... Please be careful, Your Majesty and friends.
Navia: Thank you for your concern. While I'm gone, I leave the Metropole in your capable hands.
Montagne (Both): Yes, Your Majesty!
Bizerte (Guard Captain & Sensible Conservative Citizen): Yes, Your Majesty.
Navia: Hehe, just call me "Boss" from now on. That's what everyone in the Spina calls me, and it's what I'm used to.
Paimon: So the plan for tomorrow is... journey across the ocean, make it to the end of the world, and defeat a dragon.
Paimon: Phew... That's an adventure and a half. Do all storybook heroes have to work this hard?
Nilou: At least we'll get to see some amazing scenery along the way, right? Besides, we'll have each other. It'll be a shared experience that we'll never forget.
Navia: Plus, we're pretty well-equipped for a classic heroes-versus-dragon story. We got Miss Nilou as our magic caster, and I... I guess I'm the melee warrior who leads the charge?
Paimon: Paimon can definitely see that...
Paimon: Anyway, those are tomorrow's problems! Right now, all Paimon wants is to eat a proper meal. Because worst case scenario, if Paimon ends up getting eaten by a dragon, she wants to do it on a full stomach. And something about "the end of the world" doesn't sound like a great place for food options.
Nilou: Hmm... Well, the origami animals in the Forest only drink Magic Tonic... What do the toy people here in Constellation Metropole eat?
Navia: Vegetable oil and sawdust, I think.
Paimon: Noooooo!!
