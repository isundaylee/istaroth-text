# Venti's New Plan


## Talk 1

Venti: It didn't work... I knew it.
Paimon: You "knew it"?
Venti: #I just wanted to know how influential Traveler — the hotshot of the Knights of the Favonius — is.
Venti: You see, the best warrior should always be presented with the best sword, and yet here we are...
Venti: Does the story not make for a fitting ballad?
Paimon: So what are you trying to say? That we're not good enough?
Venti: No, that's not it. More of a commentary regarding Mondstadt's inability to see the warrior standing right before its very eyes.
Venti: Very well. Looks like borrowing it is not going to be possible. We're simply going to have to steal it.
Traveler: ...
Venti: Today we stand for free will! Any suggestions on just how we steal it?
Traveler: I don't want to steal anything!
Venti: Come now, speak up. That's what free will is for.
Venti: Hahaha, look at you. Sidetracked from the start.
Venti: But seriously, you're more suitable for the job than I.
Venti: Aside from singing, I don't really have any other talents.
Venti: Besides, if I was caught, I'd have no one to right the grave injustice of my arrest.
Paimon: How can it be a "grave injustice" if you got caught stealing red-handed?
Venti: #But things are different for Traveler. You are the superstar of the Knights of Favonius. You have made contributions to Mondstadt.
Venti: Should you get caught, you would easily be able to talk your way out of it.
Venti: The guards here, it seems they're off duty throughout the night.
Venti: If we manage to seize this opportunity, it should be smooth sailing from here.
Paimon: Stop mentioning us getting caught!
Traveler: I'm sorry— Wait... Did you just say... you're Barbatos?
Venti: #Traveler... What do you say?
Venti: Ah, yes. Seems I did mention that...
Traveler: If you really are a god, then we can't simply abandon you.
Venti: Your point being?
Venti: Why does your decision hinge upon whether or not I am a god?
Traveler: And if you're not a god, then I'll help Dvalin anyway.
Paimon: #Paimon'll fill you in on Traveler's background story when we get the time...
Traveler: I will bring you the Holy Lyre der Himmel.
Traveler: I don't want to see another separation.
Venti: Huh?

## Talk 2

Otto: Man, this stinks. Having to stand around here all *day* long, having to guard this entrance.
Hey! Don't move! You can't go down there!
Paimon: Seems we're gonna have to wait until *nightfall* to sneak in...
