Traveler: Right, some destiny.
Jayant: Haha, don't say that.
Jayant: Even though the waves that flow to the harbor every day may not come from the same sea, the two of us got to meet here. What is it if not a miracle?
Jayant: Where are you from? Tell me about yourself.
Jayant: I possess a wealth of knowledge and experience. Be it ice fishing in Snezhnaya, or boat rowing in Fontaine, I know it all. In fact, I know a little bit of everything.
Jayant: So, we can talk about anything you like.
