Traveler: About your father...
Kiminami Anna: I suppose I should start from the beginning here... A long time ago, my father came to Inazuma as a foreign gourmet foodie. He was very impressed by the local culinary scene, so he volunteered to be a kitchen assistant at this restaurant.
Kiminami Anna: Later on, my father married into the Kiminami Clan. After my grandfather had been called by the Shogunate to become the head chef, he and my mom started to run Kiminami Restaurant together.
Kiminami Anna: I've been learning how to cook since I was little. I was supposed to take over Kiminami Restaurant when they retired. But my father suddenly disappeared last year without leaving a trace.
Kiminami Anna: That's how I started cooking in the restaurant to help my mom.
Kiminami Anna: Hmm... Although I've learned a lot, I'm still far from being on grandpa's level. I have to become better still if I want to take over this restaurant.
Kiminami Anna: If you have any feedback for me after trying out the food here, please don't hesitate to let me know.
