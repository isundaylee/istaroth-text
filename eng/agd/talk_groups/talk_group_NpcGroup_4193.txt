## Talk

Arasaka: #Thank you, Nara Traveler. It is because of your help that everyone can enjoy "the taste of happiness" at Festival Utsava.

## Talk

Traveler: About Festival Utsava...
Arasaka: The more friends to share the "taste of happiness" with, the better it becomes. So when Festival Utsava comes, I will make sure every Aranara gets to have a "taste of happiness."
Arasaka: By then... I think Arapacati will have a good time like everyone else.

## Talk

Traveler: About the "taste of happiness"...
Arasaka: Besides the "taste of happiness," there is also the "taste of sadness."
Arasaka: It's a terrible salty taste, which makes you very sad even with just a small bite.
Arasaka: But Nara seem to like the "taste of sadness." I don't understand this.
Arasaka: Could it be that sharing the "taste of sadness" feels happy, too?

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Arasaka: It's the taste of happiness! I can feel the happiness!

## Talk

Arasaka: #Ah, Nara Traveler! Have you heard of the "taste of anger"?

## Talk

Traveler: The "taste of anger"?
Arasaka: That taste, Nara Varuna once brought it up.
Arasaka: A taste of it would make you feel as if swallowed the flame of Vanagni. Eeek! Even the thought of it is terrifying.
Arasaka: But some Nara like that taste. They must be the bravest Nara among all.
Arasaka: #Brave Nara Traveler must like "the taste of anger," no?

## Talk

Traveler: I have things to tend to...
Arasaka: Oh... Let Arasaka know when you're all set then.

## Talk

Traveler: I like it.
Arasaka: Oh, so all brave Nara like the "taste of anger."
Arasaka: Alright, in the future "special cooking training," I will give the "taste of anger" a try. Hope... it doesn't hurt too much.

## Talk

Traveler: I don't like it.
Arasaka: Hmm... So not every brave Nara likes the "taste of anger"...
Arasaka: In the future "special cooking training," I will try to find the taste that brave Nara likes.
