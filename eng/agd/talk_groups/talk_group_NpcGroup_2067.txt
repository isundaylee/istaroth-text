Andrei: What are you doing?
Andrei: I'm sure you've been enjoying all that Liyue Harbor has to offer?
Andrei: As a native of Snezhnaya, I was initially quite reluctant about being transferred to Liyue by the Northland Bank.
Andrei: But as I came to understand more about Liyue, I found myself liking it more and more.
Andrei: Things like the sea here and the city's atmosphere are all quite different from my home, haha!
Andrei: Tell me about your home.
Andrei: My hometown is not quite as lively as the bustling city of Liyue...
Andrei: And I've completely fallen in love with the food in Liyue. With such a variety of colors, flavors, and aromas, the cuisine here is simply exquisite!
Andrei: But even so, I could never turn my back on Her Majesty the Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya.

Andrei: Tell me about the Northland Bank.
Andrei: This is actually a Snezhnayan bank that was opened here in Liyue Harbor. The building itself was constructed in accordance with the local Liyue style.
Andrei: However, many Liyue locals still seem to harbor some resentment towards our bank. They think that our presence here may be damaging the Liyue economy.
Andrei: But this clearly can be an opportunity that benefits everyone. As long as we can be fully integrated into the marketplace, the economy will only continue to grow more.
Andrei: As for our own nation's economy, we have the brilliance and foresight of Master Pantalone to thank.
Andrei: Oh, and we mustn't forget Her Majesty the Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya.
