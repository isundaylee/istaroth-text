# Like the Faint Moonlight of Yesteryear


## Talk 1

Navia: I came here several times with my father when I was little, but stopped eating here as often after growing up. I hope the food here will be to your tastes.
Paimon: Oh, don't worry, we haven't eaten at a hotel like this in a while. Hehe, Paimon's getting excited already!
Navia: In that case, I'll go order for us first. Please wait here a moment.
Paimon: Oho, everything looks so good! People in Fontaine sure know how to enjoy life.
Navia: Why, of course. Go ahead, try whatever you like. If the food's good, I'll make a group reservation for the rest of Spina di Rosula next time.
Paimon: And if it's not?
Navia: Well, ah... Then I'll still bring everyone, albeit with only one dish per table.
Paimon: You uh, sure have your own way of doing things...
Paimon: Oh, we called this a farewell meal, but we could also treat it like a victory feast, right? We did just win that case, after all.
Traveler: It's certainly worth celebrating.
Navia: Ooh, true, very true. In that case... Boss, we'll have another two dishes!
Paimon: Huh! Paimon didn't mean that you had to order even more food!
Navia: Hehe...
Paimon: Speaking of cases, do you think that the mastermind behind the serial disappearances will get caught soon now that this all has happened?
Navia: We've certainly taken a big step forward, but I feel that's about it. We know that there is an organization that means to dissolve these young women, but we still don't know what they are really after.
Paimon: If it hadn't happened right in front of us, Paimon wouldn't have ever believed that a person could be dissolved like that...
Navia: Right? Yet it was because this was such a preposterous notion that the investigation could never really move forward before.
Paimon: Ugh, if only that guy could've finished speaking... *sigh* We were so close to hearing who was behind it.
Navia: In such investigations, even the smallest step can seem like a yawning chasm if the trail of clues is cut off.
Navia: To be honest, I don't have high hopes for any follow-up that the authorities might conduct...
Navia: It's not that I don't have faith in their ability, it's just that a different perspective is required in some matters.
Navia: It's easy to guard against and deceive a single, narrow perspective. A shift in thinking is required at such times in order to produce a breakthrough.
Navia: Which is exactly why the Spina di Rosula exist.
Navia: Those highfalutin folk are not all-knowing. That's why we exist, to seep into the cracks where filth falls through, where their watch fails them. That's the kinds of problems we solve.
Paimon: Huh. Seems Paimon thought things were simpler than they actually are...
Navia: *sigh* It's alright. Well, this was supposed to be a farewell meal, so I doubt you have further interest in this business, right?
Navia: Let's talk about something else. Like... what are your future plans?
Traveler: We wanted to ask the Hydro Archon for some information...
Paimon: That's true. We didn't have a chance to speak to her after the trial ended. It didn't really seem like the right time or place to do it anyway...
Navia: I see. So your primary objective — which has been foiled so far — was to have a chat with the Hydro Archon.
Navia: I've heard that there's a long line of people waiting to meet Lady Furina. I suspect you'll be waiting for quite a while, considering that you missed your chance today.
Paimon: Yeah, we've heard that she's super popular here in Fontaine, and that it'll be tough getting any of her time.
Navia: Hmm, well... Would you consider some more... unique ways? Perhaps even methods of, let's say, questionable legality?
Paimon: Guess that's Spina di Rosula's Boss for you... Chock-full of sketchy ideas. Well, what did you have in mind?
Navia: Well, one way would be to infiltrate a performance troupe at the opera house, only to abandon your act at the play's climax and ask to speak to her after the performance...
Navia: I'm sure Lady Furina would be eager to see the ending, and would agree in order to finish watching the play, don't you think?
Paimon: Uh, could you suggest something a little more... practical? This plan seems pretty hard to pull off. We'd have to go learn how to act, and acting's really hard!
Navia: Alright, here's another...find a way to conceal yourselves under her bed. Then, wake her up in the dead of night and demand answers. Don't let her go back to sleep until she answers all your questions!
Navia: I can personally testify that this one works. When I'm sleepy, I'll do anything as long as I can finally get some sleep!
Paimon: Uh, that might work, but that's not really the problem. The problem is we don't want to get ourselves arrested.
Navia: Ah, valid point. I overlooked that part. I was just thinking about leveraging a person's desire for sleep.
Traveler: How can you overlook something like that!?
Navia: Alright, alright, no more joking around. Perhaps you could... oh I don't know, cut the line when she's on a break.
Navia: You did defeat her in court, clearing citizens of hers from false accusations — false accusations she had nearly upheld personally. I'd imagine that she feels quite ashamed about the whole thing...
Paimon: You mean that if we catch her while she's on a break, she might be too embarrassed to refuse? That does make some sense.
Traveler: It's worth a try.
Paimon: Why don't we give it a try after this meal? Y'know, strike while the iron is hot and all...
Navia: Huh? Paimon, did you drink my Fonta?
Paimon: Huh? Was this your drink?
Paimon: Ehehe, sorry about that. Paimon wasn't really paying attention, and the cup was right next to Paimon... Would you like to order another?
Navia: No, it's fine. We're just about done here.
Paimon: Alright. Honestly, Paimon wouldn't recommend Fonta anyway. It tastes kinda salty and icky.
Traveler: I'd have to agree.
Navia: Is that so? Well, in that case, we'll have to blacklist the Fonta here, then.
Navia: If we're all finished eating, then I'll go pay...
Paimon: Yeah, we're stuffed. Thanks for the treat, Navia!
Traveler: My drink also tasted that way, too.
Traveler: Would someone with her personality really feel shame?
Traveler: But we haven't had much opportunity to do so.
Traveler: It was a pleasure working with you.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Ooh, so... full... Paimon can barely float anymore...
Traveler: You could try walking, you know.
Paimon: Nah, that would be so... normal. Y'know, like you.
Navia: Hmm... Okay, as for expenses this month, we're left with...
Paimon: Hey Navia, what are you doing over there?
Navia: Oh, nothing, nothing! It was just a meal, y'know. Nothin' the Spina di Rosula can't cover, haha... *sigh*
Traveler: (Seems that was pretty tough for her.)
Paimon: Let's get ready to try to meet the Hydro Archon again. Bye, Navia!
Navia: *sigh* So this is goodbye, huh. Well, if you do encounter any other trouble in Fontaine, you're always welcome to contact the Spina di Rosula — I'll give your request the highest priority.
Navia: In any case, I wish you smooth sailing. I'll see you again, partner!
Paimon: See ya!
Traveler: (That was a pretty pricey meal, all thanks to Paimon...)
Traveler: You could try floating a little lower.
Paimon: Can't you see Paimon's barely an inch off the ground?

## Talk 3

Paimon: There aren't many people around anymore. Looks like that boat we took to Erinnyes might have been the last one...
Oceanid? (???): "Vacher..."
Paimon: Huh, looks like we're back here again...
Paimon: #Huh, Traveler? Are you hearing voices again?
Traveler: Yes...
Paimon: Uhhh... That's kinda spooky. Are you sure we don't wanna come back in the morning?
Oceanid? (???): "Vacher... Vacher..."
Paimon: Hey! Why're you still walking towards it? There might be something nasty in the water...
Traveler: (I can feel... strong emotions...)
Paimon: Huh? Hang on, Paimon can kinda hear a voice... It's calling for "Vacher," right?
Paimon: #Hey, Traveler! Stop walking! C'mon, wake up!
Traveler: (Things are... getting a little blurry...)
Traveler: And it's clearer than it was during the day.

## Talk 4

Oceanid?: ...
Traveler: ...
Oceanid?: Vacher? Are you... my dear Vacher?
Oceanid?: No, wait, you seem to be someone else... Do you know Vacher? Do you know where my love is?
Traveler: I'm afraid not...
Oceanid?: I'm... Wait, who am I...? I'm very sorry, I fear I do not know.
Oceanid?: My memories feel like they have been washed away like a flood. So many fragments dissolved amidst the tide, never to be recovered.
Oceanid?: How much have I lost? How many things that I once held dear while on land have I since forgotten?
Traveler: You were once...
Oceanid?: Yes, that is what I was once. But now, I am but the consciousness of one who has lost their form.
Traveler: You lost your form...
Oceanid?: I do not know how I came to be like this either. I only vaguely remember being covered in light blue water, and then all grew dim...
Traveler: "Light blue water"... Could that have been...
Oceanid?: Ah, I also remember going to many places. I loved adventure, loved exploring places of peril.
Oceanid?: No matter where I went, Vacher would go with me. I knew how dearly he loved me, and I also loved him equally as much.
Oceanid?: But now... We can no longer go back. The pain of such parting... I never knew how heavy it could be.
Traveler: So you need me to find him?
Oceanid?: No! Our reunion no longer has any meaning — there is no way for us to create any new memories.
Oceanid?: The thought of me gives him no succor, so let it lie forgotten beneath the waters.
Oceanid?: If you meet Vacher, tell him not to look for me. Tell him to move on — that is the only thing I still remember.
Traveler: I believe it will be hard for him to forget you.
Oceanid?: Perhaps that is so... As I was submerged in the waters, losing consciousness, I saw Vacher above the surface. His eyes were filled with such sorrow, such longing.
Oceanid?: If only I could have comforted him, told him that I did not suffer. Indeed, I had felt a great warmth...
Traveler: That means...
Oceanid?: Is that what you call it? "Dissolving"? If anything, I consider it a form of "release."
Oceanid?: It was a state of neither fear nor frenzy, with only an endless peace, like the water's still surface.
Oceanid?: I could also liken it to being a thirsty person who drinks water for the first time, and only then sees how they have lived for so long in a world of endless want and anxiety.
Traveler: It seems that after the body is dissolved...
Oceanid?: I think I hear your companion. It's time for you to go, I think.
Traveler: Is that Paimon...?
Oceanid?: Farewell, then. I am glad that you were able to sense my presence. Remember, if you see Vacher, tell him not to seek me out any longer.
Traveler: Ah right, I wonder how much time has passed in reality...
Traveler: Some measure of the consciousness still remains...
Traveler: Vacher was a witness to the fact that you dissolved?
Traveler: Could she be one of the girls who were dissolved?
Traveler: ...Human?
Traveler: I'm sorry, who are you?
Traveler: Where's this?

## Talk 5

Navia: I should thank you for lending us your sword there, Clorinde. But before I do so, could you explain how you managed to show up here?
Clorinde: I... followed you. It seemed to me that danger has followed you more closely as of late.
Navia: I believe that following someone without their knowledge is actually called "stalking," is it not?
Clorinde: Mr. Callas' last wish was for me to ensure your safety, and I will not betray his trust. He would do the same, were he alive today.
Navia: Do not... speak of my father.
Silver: Sorry Demoiselle, I was not strong enough...
Melus: Thank you for your aid, Ms. Clorinde, but do keep an eye out for your manner of speech. I believe we all wish to avoid unnecessary emotional harm.
Clorinde: Sorry. I... did not consider your feelings.
Navia: Whatever. What else do you know? How did you come to the conclusion that I'd be in grave danger?
Clorinde: I doubt I know much more than you, but I believe that the mastermind behind the serial disappearances is very powerful.
Clorinde: Your performance tonight will almost certainly attract their attention.
Navia: Hehe, I'm sure they've known about me. To be honest, I'm shocked it's taken them this long to act against me.
Navia: And what about these Gardemeks? I thought only those associated with the Maison Gardiennage could control them.
Clorinde: None of these meka have serial numbers, I was sure to check a moment ago. They are not the ones used by the authorities to enforce the law.
Clorinde: I can only conclude that some powerful or wealthy party must have obtained them via illegal means, deploying them as a private force of sorts.
Navia: What, your point being that they're out of the Spina di Rosula's league then?
Clorinde: Yes. Be careful, and do not act rashly.
Navia: I will continue investigating no matter what. We will bring the truth to light. That's... my father's true last wish.
Navia: Regardless, thank you for your help today, Clorinde. But if you get any ideas, tell me first. I don't much appreciate being followed.
Clorinde: I do not think that they'll strike again any time soon, so I shall stop following you. Good day, all.
Navia: Right. I suppose that's the best news we've gotten today.
Melus: Demoiselle, I believe that Ms. Clorinde was being sincere with you. If we tried, we could attempt to thaw relations a little...
Navia: *sigh* I know. I just... She's...
Traveler: What just happened?
Paimon: Thank goodness! Paimon thought we were done for!
Paimon: Those Gardemeks came outta nowhere while you were unconscious, and Navia and her gang saved us.
Paimon: Oh, and there was that Champion Duelist named Clorinde who came out to save us too. We got lucky there. Paimon probably couldn't have fought them off otherwise.
Traveler: Oh, so you're a fighter now, Paimon?
Navia: Oh, come now, forget all that polite talk. That wasn't really a farewell meal we had back there — not for me anyway. In truth, I hope that every meal we have together shall be a victory feast.
Navia: As such, we're still partners. There's no need to thank me.
Silver: It will take... fifty years for me to match Demoiselle's magnanimity.
Melus: If it were me, I would have joined the Spina di Rosula on account of her goodwill long ago.
Navia: *sigh* Alright, you two, that's enough...
Paimon: Actually, Navia, how did you know that we were in danger? You sure did show up in the nick of time!
Navia: Well, to be honest, you're the one who tipped us off, Paimon.
Paimon: Huh, really? Paimon contributed somehow? Paimon's even more amazing than she thought!
Navia: Yes, all thanks to you grabbing my drink by mistake.
Paimon: Uh... How did that help...?
Navia: After we parted ways, I was on the way back to one of our bases when I suddenly thought of what you said...
Navia: That the Fonta tasted "kinda salty and icky."
Traveler: Wait, do you mean that...
Navia: Fonta only comes in sweet flavors, so how could it have tasted salty? The color of the drink, if I recall, had also been a bit off...
Paimon: So the Fonta had been spiked with Water from the Primordial Sea?
Navia: Yes. So, if you hadn't drunk that cup for me...
Melus: Spina di Rosula is preparing the grandest of awards for you as we speak for saving the Boss.
Paimon: Huh, really!?
Traveler: Fortunately, Paimon, neither of us are from Fontaine...
Navia: I sent people to Hotel Debord to investigate, but whoever did this left no trace at all.
Navia: That's when I figured out that you might be in danger, and hurried here as quickly as I could.
Paimon: But why would they go after us too? All we did was defend Lyney in court and help clear his name. Ugh, now we're caught up in this mess too, aren't we?
Navia: Well, you did foil a plan that they were probably pretty proud of, and almost got their name in the process.
Navia: Speaking of which, did anything strange happen when you drank the Primordial Seawater?
Paimon: #Well, it can't be a coincidence that Traveler fainted just now. He said that he heard that voice calling for "Vacher" again...
Paimon: Oh, and this time Paimon heard it too, but it was real faint. Does this situation have to do with the Primordial Seawater, then?
Traveler: According to Lynette...
Paimon: Does that mean the Primordial Seawater raises someone's sensitivity to Hydro when it's used on people who are not from Fontaine?
Navia: That doesn't sound like too much of a bad thing, to be honest.
Traveler: I also gained some new intel.
Paimon: New intel? While you were out cold?
Navia: Well, let's hear it, shall we?
Traveler: The voice in the fountain belonged to one of the missing women.
Navia: Oh? That is important.
Black Screen Text: You tell everyone about what happened while you were connected to the Oceanid's consciousness.
Navia: Vacher... That name doesn't ring a bell. I suppose he hasn't stepped forward as a witness in court lately.
Navia: Since he saw that young woman dissolve, he was at least at the crime scene.
Navia: But he never gave testimony or any information regarding people dissolving in the Primordial Seawater. Could he have been threatened...?
Traveler: If he's still alive...
Navia: Yes, thank you. This is very important information indeed. We will continue to investigate.
Traveler: Alright, partner.
Navia: Oh!? You mean... You'll help us investigate?
Paimon: Well, you did say that our farewell meal didn't really count. That means we're still partners, right?
Paimon: #And besides, we're in this now whether we like it or not. You're not gonna let these people who targeted us get off the hook so easily, are you, Traveler?
Traveler: Messing with us will cost them.
Melus: Demoiselle, do try not to look quite so pleased. You are the face of Spina di Rosula, after all.
Navia: Ahem! You talk too much. Well, in that case, let's head back to one of our bases, shall we? I'll arrange accommodations for you.
Navia: We also have some plans to go over, and hopefully we can deepen our bonds as partners... But we'll take that one step at a time, I guess.
Silver: Don't worry, you two. With us around, our base is definitely secure.
Traveler: This will prove to be their biggest mistake.
Traveler: By "we," you mean us too, right?
Traveler: We should try searching for him.
Traveler: A person named "Vacher" was a witness when she dissolved.
Traveler: The ability to hear voices like that has to do with one's sensitivity to the Hydro element.
Traveler: Otherwise, we would've been...
Traveler: I thought it tasted strange as well, but I couldn't be sure.
Traveler: Thanks for the rescue, Navia.
Traveler: Who was that?

## Talk 6

Navia: It's right up ahead, but... Let's make sure we weren't followed first.
Silver: I've been keeping watch, Demoiselle. I haven't spotted anyone suspicious thus far.
Navia: Very good, but let's not let our guard down for now.
Melus: I shall find rooms for our respected guests.
Navia: #Thank you, Melus. Now, let's continue, Traveler.

## Talk 7

Paimon: So, uh, this is your base? It's not quite what Paimon imagined...
Melus: Your accommodations have been arranged. Under the present circumstances, I can confidently say it's the best we have.
Traveler: Thank you...
Navia: Heh, well, our funds have been a little tight lately...
Navia: After all, we don't allow illegal or unethical profiteering. In fact, our funds often come from the citizenry who support us.
Paimon: Seems like it's tough times for everyone... But if you have the support of the people, that does sound like it's worth it.
Navia: To be honest, our financial situation was a lot better back when my father was in charge a few years ago. I'm afraid I'm not quite his equal...
Paimon: Your father... He was the previous boss of Spina di Rosula, right? How did he...
Melus: Demoiselle, if you'll allow me to explain...
Navia: No, I'll explain it myself. I suppose I couldn't run from this topic forever, and as partners, this is something I hope they can understand.
Navia: My father's name is Callas. Yes, the same one they call "Callas the Unfaithful" in the streets.
Navia: Three years ago, he was accused of murdering his own friend, but he chose a duel to defend his honor instead of standing trial. He died in the Duelists' Ring.
Paimon: Oh no...
Navia: But I do not believe my father was a murderer. I'm sure he was set up...
Navia: At the time, I believed that if he only stood trial and was duly investigated, something amiss would crop up and prove his innocence.
Navia: But strangely, he not only requested the duel himself, but rumor has it...
Navia: ...That even after being seriously injured, to the point where he could be deemed as having lost the duel, he refused to surrender, determined to die in the arena.
Navia: Three years later, I still don't understand why he did that...
Navia: How could he protect his honor if he's dead? If anything he gave up his chance to defend himself.
Traveler: It does seem quite odd.
Navia: The closest piece of info I have is that my father had been investigating the serial disappearances case at the time of his death.
Paimon: Ah, so that's why you're so determined to get to the bottom of that case!
Navia: That's right. I've also tried to investigate the murder my father was implicated in, but I haven't found a single new clue in my countless reviews of the investigation records.
Navia: However, I believe that if the murder case is related to those behind the disappearances, they must know something.
Navia: I must know what really happened. Was my father coerced? Framed? Even if he really did kill his friend, I must get to the truth.
Navia: *sigh* If only he'd been more open with me when he was still alive.
Navia: He even hid the fact that my mother died due to complications when giving birth to me...
Navia: And now here I am, investigating his death. You really are a handful, aren't you, Papa?
Traveler: Seeking the truth...
Traveler: You know, we're quite alike in this regard.
Silver: Demoiselle, please... If there is anything I can do, anything at all...
Melus: I also will never believe that Master Callas murdered anyone. There are none whom I respect more than the two of you, Demoiselle.
Melus: Master Callas did so much good in life... yet all it took was one murder case for him to be dubbed Callas the Unfaithful...
Melus: Even our supporters decreased greatly due to that incident, hence our strained finances at present.
Paimon: Wait. If Callas was such a good man, wouldn't people at least be a little suspicious when he was accused?
Navia: No, perhaps people just revel in that kind of "drama." It's not something exclusive to people from Fontaine, really. Everyone's like that.
Navia: People love watching the evil turn over a new leaf, but they also enjoy watching good people fall into an abyss from one slip-up just as much.
Paimon: But how could... Never mind. If Callas was really falsely accused, we have to find the truth. He didn't deserve to have that happen to him!
Melus: There is one other thing. Master Callas' opponent in the duel... was Ms. Clorinde.
Paimon: Oh. Her? Well then, isn't that as good as saying that she was the one who killed him?
Traveler: No wonder the mood was a little strange between the two of you...
Paimon: Yeah, that's not the sort of thing you can just let go and move on from...
Melus: Ms. Clorinde has always placed great emphasis on the honorable nature of the duel. If her opponent doesn't yield, she will not stop, either.
Melus: She knew Master Callas beforehand, and greatly respected him, but seeing how he was resolute in the arena...
Melus: There was only ever one choice she could have made...
Navia: It's not that I don't understand her at all, but I... I just can't deal with this yet.
Paimon: Don't worry, Navia! Paimon knows how you feel — you don't have to force yourself to do that.
Melus: Afterward, Ms. Clorinde told us that at the start of the duel, Master Callas requested that she ensure Demoiselle Navia's safety.
Traveler: Then that indicates...
Melus: Yes, that is our understanding as well.
Navia: *sigh* Oh Papa, what madness drove you to ask the person who killed you to take care of me...
Navia: Alright, anyway... that's the information I wanted to share with you — even if it did sound like I was just complaining towards the end.
Traveler: No, it's alright.
Navia: Thanks. You two should go and rest. This was quite a day, after all.
Paimon: Yeah. Paimon's beat...
Silver: Please, relax and get some sleep. We will ensure you rest soundly.
Traveler: I understand how important this is to you.
Traveler: That he intended to die in that duel.
Traveler: For the sake of your family...
Traveler: Do you have any clues as to why?
Traveler: (Well, so much for my expectations.)

## Talk 8

Black Screen Text: A peaceful night passes under the Spina di Rosula's protection...
Paimon: *yawn* Paimon slept so well! This place feels almost too safe...
Paimon: Huh? Navia? Where did the other two go?
Navia: I sent them back to Poisson, it's Spina di Rosula's place of origin and where we have our headquarters. There's not much for them to do here at the moment.
Paimon: Paimon gets the feeling that you're just trying to get them off your back...
Paimon: But never mind that, when did you get back? Were you waiting here the whole time?
Navia: No, I just returned after going out for a while. I did some investigating yesterday regarding the name "Vacher."
Paimon: Wait, so you didn't sleep at all!?
Navia: How could I after having such critical new evidence appear?
Paimon: Uh, guess Paimon wasn't speaking for everyone just now, huh...
Navia: Unfortunately, this name seems to have been wiped from existence. It doesn't seem to have a match anywhere.
Navia: I suspect that those behind this have already taken steps to hinder an investigation from this angle — but that does prove that this Vacher person is a key witness in the incident.
Paimon: Does that mean we're too late, though?
Navia: No, there is one ray of hope, one place in Fontaine that they would find almost impossible to threaten, no matter how much they wanted to.
Navia: And that is the archives kept by Chief Justice Neuvillette. A place where detailed files on all the cases in recent years are kept.
Navia: If the... Oceanid you met is one of the young women who went missing recently, we should be able to find some related information there.
Paimon: So Neuvillette maintains an archive of case files? Guess that's the hardworking Chief Justice for you...
Paimon: In that case, let's go talk to him, shall we?
Navia: ...
Paimon: Hmm? Aren't you coming along, Navia? Did you get tired?
Navia: *sigh* No, it's nothing. Let's go see the honorable Chief Justice.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Silver: Whether it be responsibility for Spina di Rosula or Master Callas' death, it all landed on Demoiselle's shoulders so suddenly...
Silver: This won't do. I must become stronger.
