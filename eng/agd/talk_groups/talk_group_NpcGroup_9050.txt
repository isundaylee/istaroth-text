## Talk

Thoma: #Oh hey, Traveler, you're back!
Thoma: So, how goes the journey? Give me all the details.

## Talk

Traveler: Are you settling in okay?
Thoma: Haha, don't worry, I'll be fine. Believe me, I can feel at home almost anywhere.
Thoma: By the way, I really like what you've done with the place... Especially that funny little bird at the entrance...
Traveler: That's Tubby, a teapot spirit.
Thoma: Gotcha, Tubby the Teapot Spirit... Wait, what?
Thoma: I've heard my share of stories, everything from fox envoys, to bake-danuki, to tengu warriors... But a teapot spirit? That's a new one.
Thoma: Hmm, interesting. So, that teapot youkai... I mean, spirit. Teapot spirit. Did you catch it yourself?
Traveler: It's a long story. Rest assured, Tubby is no youkai.
Thoma: Not a youkai? So... just out of curiosity, this Tubby doesn't happen to be some sort of god or anything, does it?
Thoma: That would spell the end for me... I, uh, couldn't help but pat it on the head when I came in...
Traveler: That's Tubby, my butler bird.
Thoma: Gotcha, Tubby the Butler Bird... Wait, what?
Thoma: You're saying you've got a bird that's smart enough to be a butler? It's not some kind of youkai or anything... Is it?
Thoma: Heh, you never cease to impress me. I mean, taming youkai? Who knew you had that kind of talent!

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Thoma: Sure! The atmosphere here's really relaxed. It's perfect for chatting the day away.
Thoma: By the way, I've been hoping to show you around the Grand Narukami Shrine when we get the chance.
Thoma: The Sacred Sakura at the shrine is in bloom year-round. Seeing the falling blossoms dance in the wind is quite a sight to behold... definitely a surefire way to make you fall in love with Inazuma.
Traveler: Yes, I've seen them before.
Thoma: Haha, great!
Thoma: And speaking of the Grand Narukami Shrine, one word of advice... Don't ever attack any of the kitsune nearby.
Thoma: Not that you'd ever dream of doing something like that... would you?
Traveler: Of course not, I always respect the wildlife.
Thoma: Ah, that's good. I always knew that you were a kindhearted person.
Thoma: I know an old lady who loves telling stories about the unnatural. She told me that someone was once sentenced to "judgment by lightning" after attacking one of the kitsune near the shrine.
Thoma: Kitsune are highly favored by the Grand Narukami, so I guess the offender only got what was coming to them.
Thoma: Regardless, you should probably try not to provoke any animals you encounter, regardless of the species.
Thoma: All plants and creatures equally deserve our respect.
Traveler: ...Why, what's the worst that could happen?
Thoma: Huh, you're not seriously considering it, are you? Trust me, don't let curiosity get the best of you. Attacking a kitsune is bad luck.
Traveler: I'd love to join you next time.

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Thoma: Actually, I was hoping to find a nice, open area and invite you to do some skygazing together.
Thoma: Something about the sky here seems clearer than anywhere else. It makes me feel... peaceful inside.
Thoma: Don't get me wrong, sunset in Inazuma is impressive, too, but somehow it feels a little more... somber than what you have here.
Traveler: Well, we are inside an adeptus' teapot, after all.
Thoma: Huh, you're right... which is already pretty astonishing. To think that the two of us along with a whole expanse of sky can be packed inside a tiny little teapot.
Thoma: Ahhhh...
Thoma: Even if this crystal-blue sky is just a teapot's illusion, a moment of pure tranquility is a great thing all the same.
Thoma: Haha, I guess I always try to see the positive side of things.
Traveler: I appreciate that about you, Thoma.
Thoma: Haha, thanks for that.
Thoma: On a more serious note, though you may not want to show it... I can see the tiring toll of your journey in your eyes sometimes.
Thoma: Since we're already here, why not try to leave your worries behind and put your mind at ease for a while?
Thoma: And if you ever feel lonely, don't worry — you've always got me here to keep you company.
Traveler: That's why you can live a happy life.
Traveler: I know what you mean.
Thoma: Really? You do? It's great that you know how I feel.

## Talk

Traveler: Morning, Thoma.
Thoma: #Morning, Traveler!
Thoma: If you'd like some breakfast, I'd be more than happy to whip something up for ya.

## Talk

Traveler: Night, Thoma.
Thoma: #Night, Traveler! Try not to kick off all your covers, okay?
Thoma: See you tomorrow.

## Talk

Thoma: Nice teahouse you've got here. I can see you put a lot of thought into the furniture and teaware.
Thoma: Personally, I think a few pets would complete the atmosphere... What do you say?
Thoma: Oh, and don't worry, you can leave them to me to take care of.

## Talk

Thoma: Great job here, you really know what you're doing! If you placed this in Inazuma, you could probably steal a good chunk of business from Hanamizaka.
Thoma: Shame I can't flex my "fixer" muscles around here. In other words... no discounts for Thoma.
Thoma: I won't let that affect our outings here though. Food and drink's on me, hehe.
