# Missing title (3793408615)

Traveler: I hope you will be reunited.
Granny Ruoxin: Thank you, kind child. Your words bring comfort.
Granny Ruoxin: There was a time when I used to look out for him all day long, from sunrise to sunset. But the only time I saw him was in my dreams, and I would awake to find my pillow soaked in tears...
Granny Ruoxin: Now, I do not so much hope for his return as hope that he's somewhere in Liyue, living a life of peace and happiness. I do not regret the love we once shared.
Granny Ruoxin: Thank you for being such a patient listener, dear. If you don't mind, I'd like to give you this as a gift.
Granny Ruoxin: It is something that he once gave to me... But holding onto it will only bring me sadness.
