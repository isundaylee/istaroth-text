# Evermotion Mechanical Painting: Finale


## Talk 1

Félix Yogue: Ah, bravo! All six Evermotion Mechanical Painting parts, now returned to us! Now then, all we need to do is to splice them together again...
Traveler: All... of them?
Félix Yogue: Why, of course! All these six smaller parts can be reunited as one!
Félix Yogue: Together, they will form a gigantic and beauteous Evermotion Mechanical Painting.
Félix Yogue: Come, come, all we need to do now is to join them up!
Traveler: Don't we need to cast it or anything?
Félix Yogue: No, no, not at all. My machine is not some hastily cobbled-together amalgam of scrap!
Félix Yogue: Every part is wonderfully, intricately meshed together like a... like a... Um...
Félix Yogue: Eh, never mind. I've never been the best at analogies. I swear Xavier stole all the talent in rhetoric for himself.
Félix Yogue: Either way, give it a go. It'll be interesting, I guarantee it.
Traveler: Is there any other work that needs to be done?

## Talk 2

Félix Yogue: Perfect! Why, it's lovely! Skilled in both mind and hand, you are, and more so than I could have expected, too!
Félix Yogue: Hah. I do recall that several ludicrous manuscripts from The Steambird described you as... as...
Traveler: As a, uh...
Félix Yogue: Heh... As a straight-shooting knight-errant who prefers to let their blade do the talking.
Félix Yogue: Ah, how ridiculous and foolish those reporters were! How much ado they made about so little! After all, who are you, if not a sharp, smart, humble... and well, straight-shooting knight-errant?
Félix Yogue: When I get the time, they shall hear from me. Oh yes, they will!
Félix Yogue: Ah, right. Please take this particular device. You can take it out for a little leisure, should you, well, be at leisure.
Félix Yogue: As for me, I've got to start raising the Mora I'll need to travel to Liyue...
Traveler: Yes, go on...

## Talk 3

Félix Yogue: Give it a go yourself. It'll be interesting, I guarantee it.
