Traveler: What are you talking about?
Brek: You scared me! I thought it was another creditor coming for me.
Brek: I'm thinking of starting a new business. If this deal goes through, I'll be sitting atop a goldmine. I'll have enough Mora to leave the Court of Fontaine and start anew.
Brek: But that cowardly Debal... Bah! He deserves to be poor. He couldn't hold onto Mora even if you handed it to him on a silver platter.
