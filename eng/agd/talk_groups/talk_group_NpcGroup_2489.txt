Traveler: Who are you?
Yizheng: Greetings! I'm Yizheng, one of the workers here at the dock. I'm in charge of short-distance transport of small items between Qingce Village and Chenyu Vale.
Yizheng: As you can see, Wangshu Inn is just up ahead. That's where this route ends.
Yizheng: But I haven't been able to visit it via boat because I get seasick easily.
Yizheng: I've heard the food there is really good, though.

Traveler: What's so amusing?
Yizheng: Work! Work keeps me motivated!
Yizheng: Just think about it... If I work hard and improve, I'll overcome my seasickness eventually.
Yizheng: Then I can board a giant ship and become a sailor on long journeys.
Yizheng: That's my ultimate goal as a dock worker!

Traveler: Can you still be a boatman if you get seasick?
Yizheng: Well, I love the feeling of sailing on water, so there's that...
Yizheng: I've been fascinated with the ocean since I was young. I could watch large ships in the harbor for hours on end every day.
Yizheng: The old men who worked at the dock said that it took many sailors a while to get used to the waves and the wind on the ocean.
Yizheng: I got this job as soon as I came of age so I could get a head start.
Yizheng: And before I knew it, I'd been at this for many years.

Traveler: Where's this giant ship?
Yizheng: It's really easy to get stranded in the rivers here, so it's no place for large ships. You'll see them in Yilong Wharf and Liyue Harbor, though.
Yizheng: The giant ships with metal frames fear no storms and can sail right into huge waves. Exciting, don't you think?
Yizheng: I would have been on one of those and traveling the world right now if it weren't for my seasickness.
