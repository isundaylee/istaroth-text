Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.</color>
Charles: Haha, you, coming with an invitation? What's the occasion? Has Master Diluc decided to give me the day off?
Paimon: No, this is about a musical exchange taking place in Inazuma! If there's a song you like, we can play it for you right now.
Charles: A song I like, you say? Hmm... I do remember Head Housemaid Adelinde hosting several small family concerts at Dawn Winery.
Charles: They played a song at those gatherings that I do quite like. I'll do my best to hum it for you. Mind playing the song after that?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Charles: In that case, do excuse my amateurishness...
