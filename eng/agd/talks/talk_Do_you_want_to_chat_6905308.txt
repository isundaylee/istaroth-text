Traveler: *Do you want to chat?*
Sayu: Sure.
Sayu: I'll try to stay awake...
Traveler: Did you get enough sleep?
Sayu: Now that you ask, I'm getting a little sleepy again...
Sayu: ... *yawn*
Sayu: No, I have to power through it...
Sayu: If I fall asleep while I'm with you... I'll be wasting precious time.
Traveler: What about your work?
Sayu: It's okay...
Sayu: My work is just a bunch of meaningless little chores.
Sayu: It's not as meaningful as staying here.
Sayu: I can sleep, and I can chat with you...
Traveler: If you're sleepy, go lie down.
Sayu: Hmm, I'm okay...
Sayu: *yawn*... I don't want to sleep yet...
