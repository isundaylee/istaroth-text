Kourosh: *sob* The manager scolded me again today...

## Talk

Traveler: Are you alright?
Kourosh: Not really, but I'm used to it.
Kourosh: It's practice. Lessons from Mr. Sheikh Zubayr, then more practice. Rinse and repeat.
Kourosh: I thought about giving up, but then I remembered how, despite all his criticisms, Mr. Zubayr never told me to quit.
Kourosh: That means there's still hope for me, right?
Kourosh: But have I made any progress?

Traveler: You can do it!
Kourosh: Thanks. I won't give up.
