Traveler: Could you tell me about the "prophecy"?
Etienne: Ah, yes, thanks for sending me the Magic Pocket earlier.
Etienne: Whether the prophecy is true or not, the pocket remains a very convenient storage tool.
Etienne: I should probably stuff all the valuables at home into it. Even if I don't have to move, I can avoid their damage at Baguette's hands.
