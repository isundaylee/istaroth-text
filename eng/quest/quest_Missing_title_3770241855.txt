# Missing title (3770241855)


## Talk 1

Qiqi: Baizhu. I want to go on the roof. To watch the fireworks.
Qiqi: It's high up there. I don't wanna disturb the Finches down on the ground.
Baizhu: Don't worry, Qiqi, Finches just fly away as a precaution whenever they hear footsteps approaching. It's not because they're scared.
Baizhu: We can't stay here for too long, I'm afraid. We still have patients to visit...
Qiqi: Hmm... Okay. Patients are more important. Don't mind Qiqi.
Baizhu: The busy period will die down after the festival ends, and then, I'll take you wherever you want to go — promise. Okay, Qiqi?
Qiqi: Let me write that down. In my notebook.
Baizhu: Alright, here's your pen...

## Talk 2

Xinyan: Ahh... Ahh... *cough*! That party was a real blast! You know you had a good time when you ended up singing a little too hard and straining your voice...
Beidou: Seems I've caused you all sorts of trouble. Sorry it's been so tough on you.
Xinyan: Are you kidding me!? I got to go out on the ocean with you and celebrate the festival with y'all. Couldn't have asked for more. Best Lantern Rite ever!
Xinyan: I was gonna ask, though... Now that your crew is all back home with their families, aren't you gonna get bored on your own?
Beidou: Haha, not a chance. Just yesterday I got an invitation to play some chess. Said I could head up for a game whenever I'm down to play.
Xinyan: Head up...? Oh, right! You mean to the Jade Chamber.
Beidou: Uh, moving on — when you're feeling better, we should grab some food together.
Beidou: Lantern Rite only comes once a year, and I, for one, intend to make the most of it.

## Talk 3

Xiao: #...{NICKNAME}.
Xiao: You're here.
Xiao: I'm guessing this Lantern Rite is the same as every year.
Xiao: The demons have retreated and the humans are safe and well. If Pervases knew... it would be a lifelong wish come true for him.
Traveler: Xiao...
Xiao: I trust you're not here to invite me to watch the fireworks in the city?
Traveler: Guilty as charged.
Xiao: I think I'll be fine right here.
Xiao: As long as the fireworks fly high enough, you can see them from wherever you are. Besides, if anyone wishes to see me, I know they'll come and find me.
Xiao: So whether I'm here or in the city... it makes no difference.

## Talk 4

Keqing: What did you think of this year's fireworks display?
Keqing: I just hope this festival can be everything that people want it to be.
Traveler: They were lovely.
Keqing: Really? I hope you're not just saying that to reassure me. I want you to be straight with me if you have any suggestions.
Keqing: Anyway... If you have any time during the festival, take a look around the city. There's a lot to see, but it won't last. So make the most of it.
Keqing: If only I had a little more free time... I'd love to take you around and show you everything we did to make the city look special during the festival.
Traveler: I liked them a lot.

## Talk 5

Chongyun: Hmm... With everything that's happened on the way here, I feel like we're forgetting something...
Xingqiu: Chongyun, just look at the stunning scenery of Qingce Village. If I could sum it up in one word... Would you say "exquisite" does it justice? I think that—
Chongyun: Ah, I remember now! What about the demons?
Chongyun: Quick, Xingqiu, get the ancient texts out. There isn't a moment to lose.
Xingqiu: Careful now, Chongyun, let's not rush into this. Just as tea is to be imbibed one sip at a time, these things must be done step by step. If we are too hasty and end up with enemies on all sides, even we, with our level of martial prowess, may find ourselves overpowered.
Chongyun: Hmm... You do have a point. Alright then. I'll take you at your word, again.
Xingqiu: Excellent. Now then, what was I talking about? Huh, now I've lost my train of thought. Help me, Chongyun, what was I saying?
Chongyun: Uh... I've forgotten too.

## Talk 6

Hu Tao: #Well hello there, {NICKNAME}! A happy and healthy Lantern Rite to you!
Hu Tao: And what brings you here on this finest of days? Not business, I presume? So what is it? Need my help?
Traveler: Just came to see you.
Hu Tao: Oh, I see! So you just missed me all of a sudden? Oh, you — why'd you have to go and be so thoughtful, hmm? I couldn't possibly bring myself to scare you with a ghost story now!
Hu Tao: To tell the truth, this Lantern Rite's been a busy one for me. I got Xiangling to give me a few recipes and I've been trying my hand at them. Since you're here, why don't you have a taste...
Hu Tao: Wh—What's that look for!? ...You're not leaving already are you? C'mon, don't go — I promise they don't taste that bad! And I promise, it's not a prank!
Traveler: Just here to chat with you.

## Talk 7

Shenhe: Liyue Harbor by night is even brighter than Mt. Aocang by day.
Shenhe: I couldn't get used to this view at first. But I'm told this is how it always looks at the Lantern Rite. I guess everyone likes brightly lit places, because every time you mention Lantern Rite, people can't help but smile.
Shenhe: Like this, look.
Traveler: Yes, that's the Lantern Rite smile.
Shenhe: #Will you be staying here for good now, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: Just for the festival.
Shenhe: ...Oh, I see.
Shenhe: Well... it's nice to see you.
Shenhe: If Lantern Rite could continue indefinitely... that would be even better.

## Talk 8

Xiangling: Okay, so we have one group booked for two tables for a banquet tomorrow night... and another group who needs their order delivered around the same time... Phew...
Xiangling: #Oh! Hey, {NICKNAME}! Happy Lantern Rite!
Traveler: ...Are you alright?
Xiangling: Could be worse, could be worse! Festivals are always a little busy, you know how it is.
Xiangling: If you're craving anything off the Wanmin menu, don't worry about being a burden. However busy it gets, I'll always make time to cook for you.
Traveler: How's Guoba these days?
Xiangling: Hehe, aw, thanks for asking! Well, neither the stove nor the atmosphere are dying down any time soon, so Guoba's as happy as can be.

## Talk 9

Yun Jin: #Oh, {NICKNAME}! I didn't expect to run into you in Qingce Village, of all places.
Traveler: I was a little worried when I couldn't find you in the city...
Yun Jin: Thanks for your concern. I'm touched.
Yun Jin: A few days ago, Granny Ruoxin invited me to come out here and give a performance. It's mostly old folks and children who live out this way, so I didn't know whether it would be to their tastes. But everyone seemed to enjoy it, so I'm very proud of myself.
Traveler: How do you know Granny Ruoxin?
Yun Jin: She was a famous opera singer in her youth, too. She's still got it, if you ask me.
Yun Jin: In show business, while you're onstage, you constantly have to be in control of everything you're doing to manage your image. So when you're offstage, it's a relief to finally loosen up a little.
Yun Jin: I have some excellent tea here. Would you care to stay for some refreshments before you depart?
Yun Jin: Watching the Xiao Lanterns from the village is quite a unique experience in its own right. If you'd like, I can tell you all about it.
Traveler: How have you been lately?

## Talk 10

Yanfei: #Perfect timing, {NICKNAME}! Lemme make some space for you... There! Look, isn't that an amazing view? I can never get tired of it.
Traveler: Do you have time off for the festival?
Yanfei: Yep! I got a letter from my dad — he said all is well with him and mom on their travels, and wished me and Granny a Happy Lantern Rite.
Yanfei: So typical of my dad. He wrote the exact same thing last year — it's like his go-to Lantern Rite greeting!
Yanfei: But hey, I guess he doesn't overthink these things, and that's where I get my carefree side from, too. Look at me, I've taken a few days vacation just so I can enjoy the view.
Yanfei: Oh, this reminds me — I should mention you when I write back! When you meet interesting new people, you've gotta share it with your family.
Traveler: Are you off work today?

## Talk 11

Zhongli: We meet again, Traveler.
Zhongli: What a rare opportunity to meet with you here in Liyue during this finest of festivals, as busy as you are on your travels.
Traveler: Happy Lantern Rite! How are you celebrating?
Zhongli: As you can see, I'm ambling the streets at my leisure, enjoying the sound of people chattering and birds chirping.
Zhongli: Wangsheng Funeral Parlor has been somewhat idle as of late, so I am presently unoccupied.
Zhongli: When the director is out visiting friends, I take the opportunities to head out myself. Habit dictates that my first port of call is here, where I order myself a pot of tea, and listen to the storyteller.
Zhongli: At festival times, the storyteller will always select a few new passages that complement the spirit of the season.
Zhongli: Most are variations on existing legends or accounts from folk history. Their historicity is questionable at times, but it is their entertainment value that makes them an excellent choice for the festive period.
Traveler: I know exactly what you mean.
Zhongli: Hahaha, then it seems you are becoming rather familiar with the storyteller at this establishment.
Zhongli: Time marches forward relentlessly... People change, traditions change...
Zhongli: Lantern Rite is no exception.
Zhongli: In times of old, Liyue was constantly at war. People lit lanterns and sent them into the sky to help guide the warriors on the distant front back to their home.
Zhongli: Today, we live in a time of peace, and the custom of releasing lanterns has become ceremonial in nature. For the people of Liyue, the ritual of lighting lanterns every year symbolizes the undying spirit of heroism.
Zhongli: The things that refuse to be shaken by the passage of time... those are Liyue's roots.
Zhongli: Traveler, I hope that you are able to celebrate the Lantern Rite together with the people of Liyue.
Traveler: What about you? Do you have any plans?
Zhongli: Plans... not a notion that can be easily applied to me anymore. I am a man of leisure. I simply go wherever I am inclined, wherever that may be.
Zhongli: Although, now that you mention it... Yes, I should make the most of this festive period by venturing to parts of Liyue that lie beyond the harbor.
Zhongli: I began with tea at Third-Round Knockout today... perhaps tomorrow I shall try somewhere else in the near vicinity.
Zhongli: It is quite a joy to be idle and explore this bustling city at my leisure.

## Talk 12

Ganyu: #Happy Lantern Rite, {NICKNAME}. How have you been recently?
Ganyu: I hope everything's going well for you. Don't be like me, worrying all the time...
Ganyu: Oh, uh... it's nothing though, just... as you can see, there's a lot going on during the Lantern Rite, and I was originally supposed to head back to Yujing Terrace to assist with the preparations...
Ganyu: However, Lady Ningguang urged me to take a proper vacation. She said that there's nothing so urgent that it can't wait, and that this festival is a time to reconnect with friends and family...
Ganyu: But if I really spent this vacation with Cloud Retainer, it wouldn't be long before she started asking me "How has your career developed this year?" "Any new crushes one should know about?"...
Traveler: Oof, I can imagine...
Ganyu: Yes... I can handle overtime, but not that...
Ganyu: Besides that... I do feel better getting some of this off my chest. So... thank you for being here and listening to me.
Traveler: Seriously though... Got a crush on anyone at the moment?
Ganyu: What the— Don't you start that as well!
