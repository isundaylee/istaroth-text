Navia: It seems like I started to question myself a bit too much. I'll pick myself up again, and become a more reliable President, for all of you.
Navia: Looking back on it, I'm honestly embarrassed by how I acted earlier, hehe.
Traveler: About the gift from the townspeople...
Navia: I'm sure everyone longs for that one thing in life that seems trivial to others, but they themselves can never obtain.
Navia: To me, that would be a family portrait. I've always been super jealous of other people's family photos...
Navia: I never thought I'd receive a family portrait of my very own, especially not like this. Seems like I'm not such an unlucky person after all.
Traveler: About Clementine...
Navia: You know, I've thought about it before... Though my mother "only" wanted me to live a happy life, that's actually a tall order as well. In practice, it's just as hard to achieve as my father's expectations for me.
Navia: Even though my parents had very different personalities, they always had a lot of respect for each other.
Navia: The aquabus project was a monumental project that stood to benefit all of Fontaine. It would have been a little close-minded to assess or evaluate it only from the perspective of the "clan."
Navia: I think that's probably why she didn't step in to mediate, or oppose the building of the lines.
Traveler: About asking "do you really see me as your partner"...
Navia: Whoa whoa whoa, why do you have to remind me? Please, don't say that again! It's super embarrassing for me!
Navia: Forget it now, please forget that I ever said anything! Ah, wait, but it'd also be bad if you were to forget it...
Navia: Okay, but please keep it a secret between us from now on! Please don't ever mention it again!
