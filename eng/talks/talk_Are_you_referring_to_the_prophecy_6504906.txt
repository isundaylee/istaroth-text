Traveler: Are you referring to the "prophecy"?
Riqueti: The prophecy is the biggest crisis Fontaine has faced so far. But I have other things to worry about as well.
Riqueti: And even today some are discussing whether the prophecy was real or not. They just can't see what's really important.
Riqueti: We can't ignore all our other problems simply because we survived a major crisis. Assuming that life will be easy from now on is... well, it's either optimism or ignorance.
