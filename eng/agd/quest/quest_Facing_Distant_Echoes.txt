# Facing Distant Echoes


## Talk 1

Muzhen: Well, looks like we've finally located our target! Great! Guess I can go back to the ship and get some sleep!
Paimon: What? You're gonna leave just like that?
Muzhen: Of course not, we're so close! Let's head out right now and capture ourselves a Ruin machine!
Paimon: Huh, and here Paimon thought you were going to return to the ship!
Paimon: *sigh* Well, never mind. Let's follow her!

## Talk 2

Muzhen: Haha, this is the place!
Muzhen: To think that there would be underground ruins here too... *gulp*
Traveler: What's the matter?
Muzhen: N—Nothing, it's nothing.
Paimon: You don't look so good. Are you unwell?
Muzhen: Haha. I just don't normally get off the boat, so this ruin entrance is... well, quite a sight.
Paimon: Really? Paimon doesn't think so.
Muzhen: S—Still, the Captain's order still needs completing. I'm sure you're really curious as to what treasures lie within as well, aren't you, Traveler?
Muzhen: So, could I invite you, experienced and skilled as you are, to take the lead?
Traveler: You're hopeless...
Paimon: That she is! Come on, Traveler, lets go!
Traveler: Find anything new?

## Talk 3

Muzhen: Hmm? Do you need to warm up or anything?
Traveler: Can you tell me anything about these ruins?
Muzhen: Well, I'm a Technical Officer, so I don't know much about world history, I'm afraid.
Muzhen: Nonetheless, I believe these ruins to be related to the great disaster that occurred five hundred years ago...
Muzhen: I grew up listening to old sailors tell that tale, you know? They said that neither land nor sea could escape the reach of the Abyss...
Muzhen: But to me, those were no different from the ghost stories they tell to scare children.
Muzhen: I mean, only the terrors you can see are true, after all!
Traveler: Do you know anything about those mysterious machines?

## Talk 4

Muzhen: *yawn* So sleepy... What's so good about being on land, anyway...
Muzhen: Ah, hello there Traveler! Thanks for your help thus far.
Muzhen: It's all thanks to you that we've got enough for the Captain to complete the order.
Traveler: Who would want this stuff, anyway...
Muzhen: Aye, rather dangerous-looking, eh?
Muzhen: Well, our next objective is Sumeru, and I suppose only those weird researchers would study these things, anyway.
Muzhen: They aren't like those traveling scholars who wander about outdoors. I believe they're people more akin to myself — technical experts who spend most of their time in their studies researching items.
Muzhen: I would guess that those ruins don't just contain these few machines, either...
Muzhen: If you're interested, you can continue to explore those ruins and pass any components you find to me. I'll pay well for them!
Muzhen: After all, "the more the merrier" is the watchword here, both for us and for our client in Sumeru!
Traveler: Not back below decks yet?
Muzhen: Yes. My share of the work's basically done. I'm only needed again once the cargo inspection has been completed.
Muzhen: As a result, Sea Drake kicked me back onto the shore.
Muzhen: "Stop cooping yourself up in your cabin. Get some of that sea breeze, it'll do you some good." Hmph, he should just speak for himself!
Muzhen: *yawn* Well, if there's nothing else, I'll be taking a nap now. Please excuse me...
Traveler: You're still here?
Traveler: These components look rather sinister.
