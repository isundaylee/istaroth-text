The Steambird: "Insider Dealing? The La Verite Prize Decided Ahead of Time? Has the End Been Penned for the Media World of Fontaine?"
The Steambird: It is the highest honor awarded in the media world of Fontaine â€” the distinguished La Verite Prize. Yet amid all the criticisms and disputes surrounding it, has the curtain finally fallen on this magnificent award?
The Steambird: According to the critics, allowing a journalist as "young" and "lawless" as Charlotte to win such a storied award multiple times represents the backsliding and downfall of the media industry in Fontaine.
The Steambird: They cry out: "The whole thing's scripted, a sham! The winner is picked before the competition's begun! The dark age of Fontaine media is upon us! The media world of Fontaine is collapsing!"
The Steambird: But obviously, this isn't the first time they have complained thusly, and it won't be the last. So, just what does this "dark age of media" look like? Let us see.
