## Talk

Archenoul: Hello there.
Archenoul: I'm a diver employed by the Spina di Rosula, so I usually don't accept outside commissions. I hope you'll understand.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about diving...
Archenoul: If people without Visions want to dive, they need to go through specialized training first, and they must be accompanied by a professional diver when they first go underwater.
Archenoul: The underwater world is very beautiful, but never underestimate its potential dangers.
Archenoul: For example, most people only pay attention to whether their diving equipment is intact and functional, but ignore their own physical condition.
Archenoul: If you do not warm up before a dive, or if you cannot adapt to the water pressure in time, you can get muscle cramps or symptoms such as tinnitus.

Traveler: I'll leave you to it...
Archenoul: Sure. See you.

## Talk

Archenoul: Hello.
Archenoul: I'm the diver hired by Spina di Rosula, and I'm afraid I'm not taking any other commissions. My apologies.

## Talk

Traveler: For rebuilding Poisson, right?
Archenoul: Hmm... half-and-half.
Archenoul: It's partly to clear out the junk in the water and perform underwater reconstruction work. And partly to recover everyone's belongings.
Archenoul: Loads of valuables belonging to the citizens were washed away. It doesn't matter how much they're actually worth, but they all meant something.
Archenoul: I'd like to help recover them, if I can.

Traveler: I'll leave you to it, then.

## Talk

Traveler: About the flood...
Archenoul: The situation was bad back then, but it's all in the past now.
Archenoul: This is exactly why I've constantly emphasized the necessity of regular diving equipment checks. It's so that we're always ready to deal with emergencies like this.
Archenoul: Even though Navia said that the kind of disaster mentioned in the prophecy won't happen again, we should still pay attention to our safety.
