# Bloodjade Branch

Nurtured by the might of the dragon king, these bone branches glitter with strange, unique colors.
Hatred coursed through the natural streams and kissed the cold moonlight, and from them were these crystalline branches born and grown...
Even though they were severed in battle, these branches steeped in dragon blood rustle as if eternally ill-at-ease.
