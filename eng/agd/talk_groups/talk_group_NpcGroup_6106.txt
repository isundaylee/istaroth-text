## Talk

Pacha: If only I could make friends with the Riders of the Flower-Feather Clan, or their fluffy Qucusaurs...

## Talk

Traveler: If you want it, then work for it.
Pacha: Haha, that's true, but as we all know, most members of the Flower-Feather Clan enjoy flying in the sky on their Qucusaurus friends.
Pacha: It's hard enough to see one on the ground, much less set up a meeting.
Pacha: Hmm... But now that I think about it, both the Scions of the Canopy and the Flower-Feather Clan like high places, and have a pretty good relationship with one another...
Pacha: Which means, I shouldn't give up just yet!
Pacha: Mhm, it's a good thing that I'm not afraid of heights. Next time, I'll try my luck with a hot-air balloon and go even further up.

## Talk

Traveler: Good luck.
Pacha: Yeah, thank you for that, it means a lot.

## Talk

Traveler: Haven't you made any friends yet?
Pacha: Haha, it's not that easy!
Pacha: I did come across some of the Flower-Feather Clan's warriors on the battlefield, but that was hardly the time for a chit-chat.
Pacha: Those Qucusaurs flew up so high! If the Flower-Feather Clan hadn't done such a good job saving people left, right, and center, there might have been even more casualties.
Pacha: I don't think I'd be able to fight alongside them... not with my abilities, at least. Perhaps the most experienced hunters could jump as high as they can.
Pacha: But with greater abilities comes greater risk too... I still haven't heard any news of Sinchi since the war ended...

## Talk

Traveler: Heading for the high ground.
Pacha: Oho, well said.
Pacha: To continually challenge yourself is also a way to compete with your past self.
