# Sakura Arborism


## Talk 1

Miyuki: Hmm? Ah, Traveler. What are you doing at a place like this at a moment like this? ...You really are an unlucky one, aren't you.
Miyuki: If you came here to enjoy the view of the Sakura, now is categorically not the time, so please don't get your hopes up.
Miyuki: We used to have a lot of visitors coming here for the Sakura, but no one wants to come here these days. Not with all the fighting going on.
Traveler: I didn't come for the Thunder Sakura.
Miyuki: Oh, so you just happened to be passing through? In that case, I'd better warn you — the Thunder Sakura have been damaged. I went to inspect them earlier and something about them just didn't seem right.
Miyuki: Don't get too close to the Thunder Sakura — it could be dangerous. Please, be careful.
Traveler: What's a Thunder Sakura?
Miyuki: You don't know the first thing about them, do you? Small wonder, I suppose, since you're not from the shrine.
Miyuki: You've probably seen the Sacred Sakura at the Grand Narukami Shrine? That's a symbol of the Great Narukami's power. The Great Narukami is eternal, just as the Sacred Sakura will always be in full bloom.
Miyuki: Beyond the shrine, in Kannazuka, you will find Thunder Sakura. They share a common origin with the Sacred Sakura and possess a similar power, too.
Miyuki: Recently, however, the Thunder Sakura have been damaged, and they are not producing blossoms. It cannot be a good sign.
Miyuki: It alarmed Lady Miko enough that she sent me to Kannazuka to investigate.
Miyuki: So far, I have discovered a group of Treasure Hoarders who keep showing up near the Thunder Sakura. They seem very suspicious to me, and I must find out what their connection is to all of this.
Miyuki: However, I... Well, to put it bluntly, I'd be hopeless in a fight, and these Treasure Hoarders look particularly fierce...
Miyuki: Traveler, I'd like to ask you to investigate their camp and find out what they're up to.
Miyuki: I initially thought that I'd be more than capable of handling the investigation on my own, but now... it's less straightforward than I'd imagined, so all I can do is ask for your help.
Miyuki: Thank you, Traveler.
Traveler: What's the big deal with Thunder Sakura?
Traveler: That's a bummer.
Miyuki: It's a little more than a bummer. It's an absolute tragedy! Seeing the damaged condition that the Thunder Sakura are in fills my heart with grief.
Miyuki: Also, when I went to inspect them earlier, something about them just didn't seem right.

## Talk 2

Hideaki: P—Please don't kill me! I had nothing to do with the Thunder Sakura, I swear!
Paimon: Aaaand how did you know that we were here about the Thunder Sakura stuff? Guilty conscience, much?
Paimon: Paimon bets you got this Electro Hypostasis-like thingy from some dirty business, didn't you?
Hideaki: Y—You... What's that got to do with you, huh?
Traveler: Well, it's my job.
Paimon: That's right! We've been asked to right wrongs and see justice done! Out with it, then! We'll have you tell us everything the Treasure Hoarders intend to do with the Thunder Sakura, and where you got this thing from.
Paimon: If you don't talk, hehe, well, you'll taste the super formidable bite of this Traveler's sword!
Hideaki: I—I'll talk! B—But it's not as if anyone cared about these trees anyway! Can't a man and his brothers make some money off their power?
Hideaki: We had a big-shot buyer who was interested in these trees, and they even provided us with the means and tools to extract their power.
Hideaki: As long as we did as they said and opened up a gap in those trees, we could use those tools to collect the Thunder Sakura's power.
Hideaki: Then all we'd need to do was to direct that power into this crystal, and hey presto, we'd have something worth three Tenryou Commission mansions!
Hideaki: They gave us a huge sum of money, too! Not a sum you small-timers could ever spend in your life!
Hideaki: If you'll just let me go, I'll give you a share! Ten percent to you, and ninety to us. How's that sound?
Traveler: Too little, buddy.
Hideaki: What? You know what, I'm done letting you get off easy. Once our buyer gets here, you'll be the one begging for mercy from Lord Hideaki over here!
Paimon: You sure know how to talk big, eh?
Hideaki: Listen, you cocky little imp! My brothers are coming here to rescue me any time now.
Paimon: It doesn't matter who you call or how many. You won't touch a hair on Paimon's head before the Traveler sends you all running.
Hideaki: Yamada, did you hear that? This little pipsqueak said that you can't hurt her! You gonna take that lying down?
Paimon: Yamada? Who's that? Traveler, quick!
Paimon: Eh? There's no one there...
Traveler: Dream on, kiddo.

## Talk 3

Miyuki: Have you made any discoveries?
Traveler: About Hideaki...
Miyuki: So that's what's going on... But Treasure Hoarders are just petty thieves. Could their juvenile antics really cause this much havoc?
Miyuki: I suspect there must be other reasons why the Thunder Sakura are withering... I have my suspicions, but I can't say for sure...
Traveler: What do you mean?
Miyuki: This is Kannazuka, where neither the Inazuman faith nor Sangonomiya's has any influence.
Miyuki: Ever since the Vision Hunt Decree was promulgated, conflict often breaks out here between the Shogun's Army and the rebels. I don't think either side cares whether the Thunder Sakura become collateral damage in their war.
Miyuki: To quote Lady Miko, "Honors and accolades are all these military types care about." They will not listen to reason.
Miyuki: We were well prepared for this, but we hadn't expected the Thunder Sakura to be in quite as terrible a condition as they now are...
Miyuki: Anyway, here and now, the most pressing matter is to put a stop to the Treasure Hoarders' juvenile antics. Traveler, can I entrust this to you?
Traveler: You got it!
Miyuki: Please don't get careless. The Thunder Sakura being weakened makes the situation very dangerous indeed. After all, these trees serve to suppress the one who lies beneath...
Miyuki: Ah, I've said too much... P—Please forget you heard me say that. In short, please exercise extreme caution.
Miyuki: I also need some time to work through my findings. One major outstanding question is: Who is directing the Treasure Hoarders behind the scenes?
Miyuki: This case is becoming more and more complicated...
Traveler: Sounds straightforward enough.
Miyuki: I fear it may not be as straightforward as you presume. The Thunder Sakura being weakened makes the situation very dangerous indeed. After all, these trees serve to suppress the one who lies beneath...

## Talk 4

Miyuki: How is the situation with the Thunder Sakura?
Traveler: The "juvenile antics" have been dealt with.
Miyuki: Wonderful, that will at least stabilize the condition of the Thunder Sakura. I'm sure Lady Miko will also be relieved.
Miyuki: How dare these crooks brazenly seek to steal the power of the Thunder Sakura for their own gain. Their actions are unforgivable.
Miyuki: You also mentioned that the Treasure Hoarders have some sort of crystal cube at their camp with which they're trying to collect the Thunder Sakura's power? That is incredibly dangerous... It must be dealt with as soon as possible.
Miyuki: You've already helped me out enormously, so I couldn't possibly ask you to deal with this all by yourself once again. I will join you this time.
Miyuki: There's no time to delay. Let's go.

## Talk 5

Hideaki: Hmph. So, it's a meddling maiden from the shrine getting in the way of our money-making.
Miyuki: Money-making? You scoundrels. How dare you have designs on the Thunder Sakura. Lady Miko will not let you off easy.
Hideaki: Pah! Big talk, but you're forgetting who you're messing with!
Hideaki: Master, that Traveler over there's the one who's been getting in your way. Our deal's gonna be in jeopardy if you don't help us out here!
Fatui Skirmisher: Hehe. You're going to act tough in front of me, small fry?

## Talk 6

Hideaki: Ugh! Just my luck, bumping into this kind of opposition.
Miyuki: You shameless villains. Conspiring with the Fatui... the Great Narukami will strike you all down sooner or later.
Hideaki: Huh! Don't you go thinking you've got the best of me just because you successfully interfered in my business. I still have an ace up my sleeve!

## Talk 7

Hideaki: S—Stop chasing me, please... We've run this loop three times, I can barely walk...
Miyuki: You lowlifes, consorting with outlanders for profit! There would be no mercy for you, even if we ran another ten rounds.
Miyuki: Phew... From the relaxed look on your face, Traveler, I assume you've dealt with that little problem. Thank you very much.
Miyuki: The Thunder Sakura's power cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of these types, much less be handed over to the Fatui in the shadows.
Miyuki: It is hard to say what the Fatui have planned, but since we've captured this little lackey of theirs, I will be sure to get some answers from him.
Miyuki: Leave the cleanup to me. The Shogun's Army's positions are well known to me. This man will not escape.

## Talk 8

Miyuki: Damage to the Thunder Sakura brings dishonor to the shrine. We urgently need to get to the bottom of this.

## Talk 9

Miyuki: Actually, do you know where the Thunder Sakura are?
Miyuki: ...Looking at your reaction, I guess you're unfamiliar with the Thunder Sakura's locations. Well, you are a Traveler from abroad. I should have guessed as much.
Miyuki: The five Thunder Sakura trees are not difficult to find. You just have to follow <color=#00E1FFFF>the western shoreline</color> from the <color=#00E1FFFF>northernmost point</color> of the Kujou Encampment islet to the <color=#00E1FFFF>northernmost point of Tatarasuna</color> — you'll encounter three of them that way.
Miyuki: As for the other two, one is on the mountain <color=#00E1FFFF>northwest of Tatarasuna</color>, the other is on another mountain to the <color=#00E1FFFF>southwest</color>.
Miyuki: Knowing the directions should make things easier for you. I'll leave the matter of the Thunder Sakura to you. Please be careful.
