# Winds of the Past


## Talk 1

Amber: Everyone in Mondstadt is still getting blown about by the storm...
Amber: Every second we waste is a mark against the name of Favonius. Let's get in that temple, stat!

## Talk 2

Amber: This is it. One of the deserted <color=#00E1FFFF>temples of The Four Winds</color>.
Amber: These temples have been left to waste for years now. The people of Mondstadt almost never come here.
Amber: There's a chance there's a monster nest or a hilichurl camp inside.
Amber: Even Stormterror has given up on its own temple.
Traveler: "Stormterror..."?
Amber: ...Yes.
Amber: I also find it hard to accept, but... Stormterror was once one of The Four Winds.
Paimon: Ehhhh!?
Amber: Wait... Did you just feel that?
Amber: The wind here... Something's off...
Amber: #Let's go in and take a look, {NICKNAME}. Be careful, the dragon's power is disturbing this area.
Traveler: Wait, did you just say "its own temple..."?

## Talk 3

Amber: Phew, I'm tired.
Amber: But, at least this way we've helped Jean out.
Amber: In the past, we were at least able to defend the city and keep it safe.
Amber: This, of course, is mostly thanks to Jean.
Amber: But now with Stormterror directly attacking the city itself...
Amber: "The winds change, so too should our tactics."
Traveler: Sounds deep.
Amber: It's what Lisa likes to say.
Amber: Speaking of which, The Four Winds we were discussing earlier...
Amber: If you want to learn more about our history, you can ask Lisa.
Amber: ...I'm not saying I don't know our history! It's just...
Amber: I mean... A librarian is supposed to be more knowledgeable than an Outrider, right?
Traveler: Did you come up with it?
