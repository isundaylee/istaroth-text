# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Keqing: Sure, why not?
Keqing: Though I should warn you, most people aren't exactly enamored with my conversation.
Traveler: Oh, what do you mean?
Keqing: Well, for example, a colleague once asked me: "Is there anything I can help you with, Ms. Keqing?"
Keqing: To which I replied: "You can start by worrying about your own work rate."
Keqing: After that, they never approached me again.
Keqing: Another person asked me: "Do you have any gift suggestions for Lady Ningguang?"
Keqing: To which I replied: "Don't bother. Ningguang has no time for suck-ups."
Keqing: Yeah... Anyway, so now you know.
Traveler: Sounds like you're just a bit of a straight talker.
Keqing: Yeah... I just think if you've got something to say, there's no point mincing your words.
Keqing: Sugar-coating the facts, kind lies... it's all a big waste of everyone's time.
Traveler: Getting to the point is certainly... underrated.
Keqing: Exactly. See? You understand where I'm coming from.
Keqing: I was right all along, we've got a lot in common.
Traveler: Still, doesn't being so blunt all the time affect what other people think of you?
Keqing: I couldn't care less what those people think of me.
Keqing: But your opinion...
Keqing: ...Well, that might make me think twice.
Traveler: I don't think you did anything bad.
