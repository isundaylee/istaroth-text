# Talk Dialog

Tighnari: What should I get...?
Traveler: Tighnari, this gift envelope is for you.
Tighnari: #Ah, I didn't expect to see you here, Traveler. Thank you for the envelope â€” it's lovely.
Traveler: Enjoying the festival?
Tighnari: Cyno and I have had a great time. We ate a lot of delicious food and bought quite a few gifts.
Tighnari: Unfortunately, the Harbor is a little too busy this time of year. If I stay around the commotion for too long, my ears start to hurt.
Tighnari: So, I came over here for a break.
Tighnari: Cyno said he needed to be alone for a while to think about something.
Traveler: Oh... a case of some sort?
Tighnari: No, I don't think so...
Tighnari: He kept mumbling about "gift envelopes," so odds are, he's trying to come up with a new joke...
Tighnari: How do you even make a joke out of something like that...?
Traveler: Something to do with work?
Traveler: See you later, then.
Tighnari: Bye! I'm going to look for Cyno. *sigh* Let's hope he's not feeling too inspired today...
