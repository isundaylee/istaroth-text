# Facing Distant Echoes


## Talk 1

Muzhen: Well, looks like we've finally located our target! Great! Guess I can go back to the ship and get some sleep!
Paimon: What? You're gonna leave just like that?
Muzhen: Of course not, we're so close! Let's head out right now and capture ourselves a Ruin machine!
Paimon: Huh, and here Paimon thought you were going to return to the ship!
Paimon: *sigh* Well, never mind. Let's follow her!

## Talk 2

Muzhen: Haha, this is the place!
Muzhen: To think that there would be underground ruins here too... *gulp*
Traveler: What's the matter?
Muzhen: N—Nothing, it's nothing.
Paimon: You don't look so good. Are you unwell?
Muzhen: Haha. I just don't normally get off the boat, so this ruin entrance is... well, quite a sight.
Paimon: Really? Paimon doesn't think so.
Muzhen: S—Still, the Captain's order still needs completing. I'm sure you're really curious as to what treasures lie within as well, aren't you, Traveler?
Muzhen: So, could I invite you, experienced and skilled as you are, to take the lead?
Traveler: You're hopeless...
Paimon: That she is! Come on, Traveler, lets go!
Traveler: Find anything new?

## Talk 3

Muzhen: Hmm? Do you need to warm up or anything?
Traveler: Can you tell me anything about these ruins?
Muzhen: Well, I'm a Technical Officer, so I don't know much about world history, I'm afraid.
Muzhen: Nonetheless, I believe these ruins to be related to the great disaster that occurred five hundred years ago...
Muzhen: I grew up listening to old sailors tell that tale, you know? They said that neither land nor sea could escape the reach of the Abyss...
Muzhen: But to me, those were no different from the ghost stories they tell to scare children.
Muzhen: I mean, only the terrors you can see are true, after all!
Traveler: Do you know anything about those mysterious machines?
