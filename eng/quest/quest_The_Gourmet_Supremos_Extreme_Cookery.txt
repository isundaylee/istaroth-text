# The Gourmet Supremos: Extreme Cookery


## Talk 1

Kamei Munehisa: We meet again.
Kamei Munehisa: Sorry for my impudence, but I need your help with a certain matter today.
Traveler: What is it?
Kamei Munehisa: After I was hired by Xudong, I have been traveling with him and the others.
Kamei Munehisa: I want to make some gifts as my token of appreciation for his taking me in.
Kamei Munehisa: But since Xudong appears to prefer cooking to martial arts, I would like to make some food personally.
Kamei Munehisa: I had already found two locations for the necessary ingredients, and I was planning to retrieve the ingredients once they have ripened.
Kamei Munehisa: However, there are two groups of monsters occupying those two locations, and they all have already taken the ingredients.
Kamei Munehisa: The freshness of the ingredients is essential for me to cook the dish. I was planning to get them from one place first and then go to the other...
Kamei Munehisa: But now that both groups of monsters have already taken the ingredients, I must retrieve those two ingredients as soon as possible if I am to cook that dish.
Kamei Munehisa: However... I can't be in two places at once. Even if I can handle the monsters at one place, the ingredients would have already been ruined by the monsters at the second.
Kamei Munehisa: That's why I need your help. We will defeat those monsters at the same time and retrieve the ingredients.
Traveler: Well, leave it to me then.
Kamei Munehisa: Thank you. I honestly can't thank you enough.
Kamei Munehisa: Hmm... talking more about it here won't do us any good. Please come with me, and we shall discuss further.
Traveler: After you are done cooking the dish, could I have some?
Kamei Munehisa: Of course. Indeed, you shall be the first to have it.
Traveler: No need to be so courteous...
Kamei Munehisa: Since I need something from you, this sort of etiquette is necessary.

## Talk 2

Kamei Munehisa: This is the place. The two groups of monsters have set up camp on both sides.
Kamei Munehisa: I have already snuck in there to scout. Although the monsters at the left camp appear to be weaker, there are many of them.
Kamei Munehisa: There are fewer monsters at the right camp, but they are much stronger.
Kamei Munehisa: Please eliminate the monsters at one camp and leave the other camp to me.

## Talk 3

Traveler: I will take care of the camp on the right.
Kamei Munehisa: Then I shall leave it to you. I will go to the other camp.
Traveler: Can you handle them yourself?
Kamei Munehisa: They are just monsters. There is no need to worry about me. If it weren't for the ingredients, I would have been able to take them all.
Kamei Munehisa: Alright, once you have eliminated the monsters and retrieved the ingredients, you can come find me at the other camp.
Kamei Munehisa: Let's get going now. If the ingredients are ruined, I'm afraid that the dish won't be as tasty as I promised.

## Talk 4

Traveler: I'll take the left side.
Kamei Munehisa: Then I shall leave it to you. I will go to the other camp.
Traveler: Can you handle them yourself?
Kamei Munehisa: They are just monsters. There is no need to worry about me. If it weren't for the ingredients, I would have been able to take them all.
Kamei Munehisa: Alright, once you have eliminated the monsters and retrieved the ingredients, you can come find me at the other camp.
Kamei Munehisa: Let's get going now. If the ingredients are ruined, I'm afraid that the dish won't be as tasty as I promised.

## Talk 5

Kamei Munehisa: Have you retrieved the ingredients?

## Talk 6

Kamei Munehisa: Thank you! These ingredients are still usable, but we cannot delay any further... I'm going to get started with the cooking now.
Kamei Munehisa: It's done. Phew... it's all thanks to you that this dish was completed smoothly.
Traveler: You truly are a perfectionist...
Kamei Munehisa: Of course. Be it floral design, tea, cooking, or swordsmanship, if you don't pursue perfection, their meaning will be lost.
Kamei Munehisa: The path of "extremes" is my way of living. However... Xudong appears to hold a different opinion.
Kamei Munehisa: He once told me that there is a word in Liyue called moderation.
Kamei Munehisa: It means one should always avoid being extreme, whether it be living one's life or doing certain things. Moderation without leaning towards either side is the best way to live.
Kamei Munehisa: I don't quite understand what Xudong meant, really.
Kamei Munehisa: But I believe that he must have gone through many things to have come up with this sort of philosophy...
Kamei Munehisa: Since we have already acquired the ingredients and finished cooking, I shan't take any more of your time.
Kamei Munehisa: Please take this, and I will bring the rest to Xudong. I'm certain he will be happy to try them.
Traveler: What about those monsters...
Kamei Munehisa: I have already taken care of them. There is no need to worry.
