Traveler: About the Vision Hunt Decree
Paimon: It's hard to talk about the recent events in Inazuma and not mention the Vision Hunt Decree.
Paimon: But you don't have a Vision, so you don't have to worry about losing one.
Paimon: #On the flip side, if you are caught by the Tenryou Commission, {NICKNAME}, you also can't surrender your Vision in exchange for your life...
Traveler: I can tell them...
Paimon: Another reason to have Paimon around... Wait, WHAT!?
Traveler: Don't worry, I wouldn't let them take you, Paimon.
Paimon: That's more like it.
Traveler: We'd just go to jail...
Paimon: Uh... Wâ€”Well, if that's how it would go down, then maybe you should hand Paimon over to them...
Paimon: ...Wait a minute! How about we just don't get caught in the first place?
Traveler: And suffer punishment together...
Traveler: ...That you are my Vision.
