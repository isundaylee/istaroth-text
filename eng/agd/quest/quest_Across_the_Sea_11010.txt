# Across the Sea


## Talk 1

Daipai: Be on your guard, Traveler. Now is no time for sightseeing.
Paimon: Oh, why's that? Has something happened?
Daipai: Yes. As unusual as this may sound, numerous eyewitness reports have confirmed an active Ruin Guard presence in this area, even though this is far beyond their normal area of activity.
Daipai: Sergeant sent someone to find out just where these ancient machines might have come from. It appears that they simply left their ruin and marched off all of a sudden, for no clear reason.
Paimon: So did somebody wake them up?
Daipai: As I say, the reason is still unclear. We have very little intelligence at present.
Daipai: Moreover... The ruin in question is of the especially spooky variety. Strange noises are often heard coming from within...
Daipai: As such, we are not permitted to investigate until the order comes through from headquarters.
Traveler: One can never be too cautious.
Daipai: In any case, the only sensible strategy in the meantime is to increase Millelith patrols. We must not let innocent civilians come to harm.
Paimon: That's a good point... Ruin Guards are probably pretty dangerous for regular folk...
Traveler: Is there any way I can help?
Daipai: Wow, uh... I'm very grateful indeed for the offer, but... it just wouldn't be worth the risk.
Paimon: #Oh, don't worry about that! Traveler here, he beats up Ruin Guards for breakfast!
Traveler: I do know a little self-defense.
Daipai: Is that so...
Daipai: Well, if you're genuinely offering...
Daipai: I did see some Ruin Guard footprints on the *hillside*, but since then I've been too busy warning passers-by to investigate myself...
Paimon: Footprints, eh? Interesting... We'll take the case!
Daipai: While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail! On behalf of the Millelith, I salute you, Traveler. You have my gratitude. I will rendezvous with you once I have finished my patrol.
Traveler: Not to brag, but I could beat ten of you in a fight.
Daipai: Ahaha, the self-confidence of young people is an extraordinary thing...
Traveler: The Millelith... Always so inefficient.
Daipai: Sorry? Did you say something?
Paimon: ...Was that supposed to be your impression of Master Diluc talking about the Knights of Favonius?

## Talk 2

Paimon: The trail of Ruin Guard footprints leads us here, to... Ah! A Ruin Guard! Over there!

## Talk 3

Paimon: And here's another one. Yep, seems the Ruin Guards did come out for a walk after all.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Well, that's one down.
Paimon: Let's keep looking around. Maybe we'll find some more.

## Talk 5

Daipai: I must continue with my patrol now. Let's rendezvous shortly.
