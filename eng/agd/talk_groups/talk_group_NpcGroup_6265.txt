Traveler: How have you been lately?
Nepecha: I'm having a great time here! There's so much to learn every day, and so much to eat...
Nepecha: It hurts when sparks from the forge hit my hands, but I'm not scared of pain!
Nepecha: Xilonen said that she's already looking into my past. I haven't heard from her yet... but I believe in her!
Nepecha: Now, I write in my diary every day, recording all the interesting things that I experience.
Nepecha: The next time I dream of Nechca, I can tell her about it all! She'll be so happy, I know it!
Nepecha: I also want to tell her how I'm doing my best to study, eat, and grow up, and that she doesn't need to worry about me!
Nepecha: *sigh* But I haven't dreamt of her again. Could she... Did she really leave...?

Traveler: About the future...
Nepecha: I... want to be a Name Engraver too, just like Xilonen.
Nepecha: Though I still can't get my head around all those books, and... I'm also kinda scared of the furnace...
Nepecha: I'll do my best! When I grow up, I'll be super powerful...
Nepecha: At least... I don't want everyone to have to keep worrying about me.

Nepecha: See you! Err... Where'd I leave that textbook again...
