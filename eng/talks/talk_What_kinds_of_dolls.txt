Traveler: What kinds of dolls?
Kaede: Our featured products are statues of fox spirits and porcelain tanuki dolls. Uh... tanuki dolls sell a bit better.
Kaede: They represent good fortune in Inazuma. Many business owners buy one to place in their stores, hoping for financial success.
Kaede: They look really cute as well! It's not a bad idea to gift them to your favorite girl or the children in your family.
