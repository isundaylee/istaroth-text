# Return of the Jade Chamber?


## Talk 1

Kun: These items are really hard to find...
Traveler: Is something wrong?
Kun: Oh, it's you. Do you still remember the affair with the Jade Chamber? Baiwen came over some days ago, saying that a schedule's already been drawn up for its reconstruction.
Kun: While it's impossible to finish building it so quickly, there are some small matters that can be prepared beforehand.
Kun: She gave me a checklist and told me to look through the items and see what I can easily get hold of, but also that I needn't go out of my way to get them all.
Kun: To be honest, though, I couldn't leave my post even if I wanted to. The Ministry of Civil Affairs is getting busier by the day, so I really don't know...
Kun: It would be great if you had the time to help me make the trip. Baiwen did look like she was rather anxious for this to get done...
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Kun: Thanks for the help.
Kun: Let me see... Hmm, they first want a book called "Meadow of Gems," and some small bamboo ornaments.
Kun: You can ask Jifang about the book. As for the bamboo ornaments, I believe that Master Lu of Fanmu Carpenter's makes them.
Kun: I'm sorry, but I'll have to leave this matter in your hands. Hmm, but it would indeed be good if the Jade Chamber could be rebuilt...
Traveler: You're really rebuilding the Jade Chamber?
Kun: I've heard Baiwen say that the schedule's already been sent out. But given how large that building is, I think that it will take some time to rebuild it...
Kun: They're just preparing some small items at the moment. Things will really get busy once they officially start the rebuilding process.

## Talk 2

Jifang: Hi. Would you like to buy anything?
Traveler: We'd like a copy of "Meadow of Gems."
Jifang: "Meadow of Gems"? We don't have it in stock here. Do you need it in a hurry?
Traveler: Well, they're rebuilding the Jade Chamber...
Jifang: Are they really? Well, that would require proper preparation, yes. Let me think...
Jifang: Perhaps you can look for Qingzhou instead. He is extremely well-read — perhaps he might know where a copy of "Meadow of Gems" might be found.
Traveler: Got it.
Jifang: If my memory serves, Qingzhou often lodges at the Wangshu Inn. You can try looking for him there.

## Talk 3

Qingzhou: A conundrum. Most vexing, indeed...
Traveler: So, uh, do you know anything about the "Meadow of Gems"?
Qingzhou: The "Meadow of Gems," you say? Yes, I do recall that book.
Qingzhou: I once went hither and thither in search of material with which to write a poem about merchants and happened upon this book in the process.
Qingzhou: I did not fully comprehend the book's contents, but some of its anecdotes proved most inspirational nonetheless.
Qingzhou: Let me try to recall the name of that poem. Pray, give me a moment...
Traveler: Do you remember where I can find that book?
Qingzhou: Ah, so you wish to locate that book? I must confess that no such place comes to mind...
Qingzhou: However, if you need it urgently, I could just write you out a copy of it myself.
Traveler: Write it out?
Qingzhou: Ah, it was hardly a lengthy text. Memorizing it was no tall order.
Qingzhou: More to the point, the book collector wouldn't let me loan it out.
Qingzhou: And since poetry is not something that one can rush, I decided I'd simply write out a copy for my continued perusal... The book's contents were not very long, either, so I have it more or less memorized now.
Traveler: That's seriously impressive work...
Qingzhou: Ah, it is but a trifling matter, my liege. Still, perhaps you could do me a favor in exchange for the hand-written text.
Qingzhou: As embarrassing as this is... I have been so focused on gathering inspiration here that only now do I realize: I have completely forgotten to eat today. Suddenly, I feel rather ravenous.
Qingzhou: Could you help me get a serving of Triple-Layered Consommé? In exchange, I shall write you a copy of "Meadow of Gems."
Qingzhou: I believe that I should just about be done by the time you return.
Traveler: From memory?

## Talk 4

Qingzhou: The "Meadow of Gems," how does it start... Ah yes, "Commerce and trade, like springs and streams, begin with the mountains and end with the seas..."

## Talk 5

Qingzhou: "This grand plan charts the course that will lead us, slowly but surely, to Liyue's longevity and the people's prosperity."
Qingzhou: Ah, you've returned. One moment, I am still penning the last few lines...
Qingzhou: Hmm... There. That should do it.
Traveler: Here's your Triple-Layered Consommé...
Qingzhou: Ah! That can wait, though — first, please see if the book is to your satisfaction. I trust that you will find my penmanship to be quite satisfactory.
Traveler: This is seriously impressive work...
Qingzhou: Hahaha, you praise me excessively, my liege. This book is for you. Don't lose it, now.

## Talk 6

Master Lu: Hmm? Do you need anything?
Traveler: I'd like to order some small ornaments made of bamboo...
Master Lu: Small bamboo ornaments, you say? I could do it, but may I know where this order is coming from?
Traveler: It's from this checklist of Baiwen's...
Master Lu: Oho... an order from Yuehai Pavilion, is it? Well then, I suppose I should complete it as quickly as I can, then.
Master Lu: There is one problem, though: the bamboo forest that I frequently gather materials from has suddenly become occupied by a great many boars, for reasons unknown to me.
Master Lu: Though it is not much of a problem, I often have to go around them to collect bamboo...
Master Lu: If you could chase those boars out, I can go and collect some bamboo now, and we can begin work right away.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Master Lu: I shall wait for you here, then. Once you have chased those boars out, come back and give me a shout.

## Talk 7

Master Lu: So, have you chased those boars away?
Traveler: All of 'em.
Master Lu: That will do. I shall head over to collect bamboo in a while. Once the ornaments are ready, I shall have them delivered directly to Yuehai Pavilion.
Master Lu: This order is quite large. There's quite the sum to be made here...

## Talk 8

Baiwen: Hello, can I help you?
Traveler: So, about those preparations you've been making...
Baiwen: This is... the "Meadow of Gems"? Where did you get this book? I've searched high and low throughout Liyue, and I couldn't find it even so...
Traveler: Qingzhou hand-wrote a copy for me.
Baiwen: That poet? Hmm, it seems that his reputation is well-founded...
Baiwen: Thank you for your help in preparing these objects. Once Master Lu sends those ornaments over, I will also arrange for him to receive appropriate compensation.
Traveler: So, you're rebuilding the Jade Chamber, huh...
Baiwen: Indeed, we do have plans to do so. But with the number of things we will need to prepare, there is still much work to be done. I doubt that we can finish rebuilding it quickly.
Baiwen: Not to mention our biggest material headache, which we have yet to find a solution to...
Baiwen: Never mind, I shall not speak of it. Thanks for your help once again — and please, accept these for your aid. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must return to my work.

## Talk 9

Master Lu: Hmm, small bamboo ornaments...

## Talk 10

Qingzhou: "There are those who lose their jobs and have no reliable source of food, nor a roof over their heads, they toil in vain in their barren fields. All the while, the wealthy merchants' residences overflow with gold and jade. What justice and uprightness is this?"
Qingzhou: Though this passage still speaks of the mercantile way, it reveals quite a fair amount more meaning upon closer reading...

## Talk 11

Kun: These items are really hard to find...
Traveler: Something the matter over there?
Kun: Oh, it's you. Well, you must know that the Jade Chamber has finally been rebuilt, right?
Kun: I never thought that such a huge place could be rebuilt just like that...
Kun: Baiwen came looking for me several days ago, asking me to prepare a few items to help redecorate the Jade Chamber's interior.
Kun: Look, she even passed me a checklist and all, telling me to keep the various items recorded there in mind.
Kun: I'll be honest with you, though. My work at the Ministry of Civil Affairs has been getting more hectic by the day. There's just no time to help her...
Kun: Could you help me make the trip to find these items, Traveler? Baiwen did look like she was rather anxious for this to get done.
Traveler: Consider it done.
Kun: Thank you!
Kun: Let me see... Hmm, they first want a book called "Meadow of Gems," and some small bamboo ornaments.
Kun: You can ask Jifang about the book. As for the bamboo ornaments, I believe that Master Lu of Fanmu Carpenter's makes them.
Kun: I'll leave it in your hands, then. Ah, the rebuilt Jade Chamber truly is a magnificent sight...
