## Talk 1

Esnoir: No matter how many times you ask, Rozel, I will not go out venturing with you.
Esnoir: You're my friend, yes, and that will never change. I do not dislike you. But... I do not enjoy traveling.
Rozel: Esnoir. It is nowhere near as frightening as you imagine. It's just a trip, that's all.
Rozel: The outside world plays host to many flowers that cannot be found in our village and many people we've never met — even the shapes of the clouds are different there.
Rozel: Remember the seed I brought you from outside? I can guarantee that you've never seen any flower with its shape or color before.
Esnoir: It's still a seed now. I'll plant it, and then we'll see.
Rozel: If you're willing to go with me, we might be able to see this flower with our own eyes.
Esnoir: Rozel... I'm sorry, I have no wish to travel abroad, nor do I want to become like those venturers.
Esnoir: They always fret about the value of carpets, and pay no mind to beautiful hats...
Esnoir: This is how your travels change you, and it scares me.
Rozel: That is true. But have you noticed the maps, the plant samples, and the travelogues that fill their luggage to bursting?
Rozel: We surge through different bushes and shrubs like a gust of wind, like rivers passing through another lake... We encounter different things, and we, too, become different people.
Rozel: This is how travel changes you, and it scares me too... But I'm thankful for those changes as well.
Rozel: I'd compare it to a slice of bread with cream slathered on both sides. You're going to make a mess no matter how carefully you try to hold it.
Esnoir: In that case, I'd spread the cream on separately. That way, I can even smear on different flavors.
Traveler: Not a bad call. I'm sure it'll be a filling meal.
Esnoir: Ah, it's you, here at last! Rozel has been telling me how wonderful the outside world is, inviting me along to venture...
Esnoir: Do you know much of that world? Is it... as he says it is?
Traveler: Not a bad idea. That should keep your hands clean.

## Talk 2

Traveler: Yes, it is. In the <color=#FFCC33FF>outside world</color>, there's no lack of new things to discover.
Paimon: Right! There's lots to eat, and many fun things to do, and you'll even get to encounter many interesting things and awesome people. For example...
Traveler: You'll find those who focus on the beautiful essence of all things.
Esnoir: Really? Dear me. I'd believed the outside world to only be conscious of "value," and to be full of those who wish to wear hats but dare not.
Paimon: Hmm, well, you can think of it... Like a cake with various chocolates scattered on top! Every bite's a whole new experience.
Paimon: That's way better than having all the chocs taste the same — 'cause that would make for a super ordinary cake, right?
Traveler: Well said, Paimon, well said.
Paimon: Well, who wouldn't after listening to it for this long?
Esnoir: Is that so? Well, I... I'll need more time to think about this. But perhaps a little... Just a little venturing couldn't hurt, surely?
Rozel: No need to rush into things, Esnoir. There is still much time before my next voyage. Until then, let us consider this issue together.
Traveler: You've mastered the local lingo, I see.
Traveler: You'll bear witness to radiant, unfading ideals.
Traveler: You'll get to meet those who work hard to realize their dreams.

## Talk 3

Traveler: The <color=#FFCC33FF>world inside</color> isn't too bad.
Paimon: That's true. This is your home, after all, Esnoir. Paimon's sure you like it here. Also...
Traveler: Friends you are familiar with live here.
Esnoir: Indeed! I worry about losing these, and I fret about them constantly.
Esnoir: This is all good. Wonderful, even. I have no wish for them to change, nor do I wish to change.
Esnoir: But... Venturing abroad will cause everything to change. Won't it? Rozel?
Rozel: Yes. It definitely will. I will not deceive you, nor do I wish to sadden you, dear Esnoir.
Esnoir: Alright... Alright. I understand where you're coming from, as I'm sure you do me.
Esnoir: I need time to consider your invitation before making my decision. If nothing else, let us simply enjoy this spot of tea in peace.
Rozel: Alright. I will accompany you, Esnoir. There is still much time before my next voyage. Until then, let us consider this issue together.
Traveler: There are many pretty flowers...
Traveler: And delicious cakes.

## Talk 4

Esnoir: Rozel, maybe... I can go with you. But... I just don't know where to even begin preparing.
Rozel: That's easy. Prepare your jam, bread, and curiosity. Put on some comfortable clothes, and bring a spare set as well.
Rozel: Finally, prepare yourself — Because you might have to throw some of those things out along the way.
Esnoir: Oh. It all sounds so complicated. And I don't want to throw them away, because they're mine, they're precious, and I like them.
Rozel: And you'll discover new precious things after those leave you, my dear Esnoir.
Rozel: Believe me, this will be a fascinating journey.

### Additional Talk 1

Esnoir: I'm sorry, Rozel. I... still can't go with you.
Esnoir: It's enough for me to stay here. That way, there will be someone here waiting for you when you come back from venturing.
Rozel: But, Esnoir, I...
Esnoir: I'm not smart enough, nor brave enough, Rozel. But I believe...
Esnoir: I believe that the breeze rustles through the brush, the rivers run through the lakes, and the cycle begins anew. That in the end, all returns to where it began.
Esnoir: Perhaps, after experiencing so many changes, their final wish is still... to go back to being their old selves.
Rozel: ...
Esnoir: I will wait for you here, at home, my friend. As I ever have.
