# Secret Ingredient


## Talk 1

Xiangling: I think we're getting close...
Paimon: Have you decided what you're looking for yet?
Xiangling: Of course not!
Paimon: Then how are you so sure of yourself?
Xiangling: That's just my style. If I decided in advance exactly how I was going to cook something, there'd be no element of surprise to the dish.
Xiangling: In the same way, if I knew what I was looking for before I found it, it wouldn't be a surprise.
Paimon: But that's so risky...
Xiangling: Relax, this is how I came up with all the signature dishes at Wanmin Restaurant.
Xiangling: Let's look around here, I'll let you know when I find something I like.

## Talk 2

Xiangling: I still feel like we're lacking something...
Traveler: What do you mean?
Xiangling: It's missing a little boom shaka-laka!
Paimon: Yeah, now that you mention it, it is a little boom shaka-laka-lacking.
Traveler: A shaka-laka-loada what now?
Paimon: Hehehe...
Xiangling: Brook may be a stickler for convention, but she is a talented chef nonetheless.
Xiangling: There's no doubt she will source the fanciest-quality ingredients. To win this will take a truly mind-blowing dish...
Xiangling: Something like sea-serpent salad, stir-fried Qingxin flower, or wild mushrooms in a rich slime jus.
Paimon: Urgh... a slime jus!?
Xiangling: Haha, I know how weird it sounds but I guarantee you it tastes incredible.
Xiangling: I'll make some for you next time!
Traveler: Can't wait to try it.
Xiangling: Hee-hee, you won't be disappointed when you taste it, although it looks a teensy bit gross.
Xiangling: Never mind that, I've just remembered there's somewhere I never checked out last time.
Xiangling: My gut tells me that's where we'll hit the jackpot. Let's take a look!
Traveler: Eh... No need.
Xiangling: I don't get it, what's not to love...?
Traveler: Paimon, you understand this?
Traveler: Do you mean it's not impressive enough?
