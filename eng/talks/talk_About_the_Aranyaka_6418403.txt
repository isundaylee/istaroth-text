Traveler: About the Aranyaka...
Araja: Nara Varuna left this, and Arama is giving it to you. Arama thinks he did the right thing.
Araja: It's filled with stories between you and Aranara, right? Araja knows that Nara will forget about how to dream, and forget about us.
Araja: However, as long as the Aranyaka keeps the records of our stories and names, you can always read it without the memories about Aranara.
Araja: When that day comes, Araja hopes you will find these stories interesting and touching.
