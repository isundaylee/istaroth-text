Traveler: Sounds like a heavy drinker.
Shevirme: Haha, I actually have no idea what he does, but folks say he's a Mahamata.
Shevirme: He was tall and looked like a guy who could hold his drink. But I couldn't tell if he bought the wine for himself or for someone else...
Shevirme: I remember him murmuring something like "one case should be enough for an apology" as he carried the wine.
Shevirme: ...Say, maybe he wanted to get someone drunk so that they'll forget his mistakes?
