## Talk

Traveler: (There are a few opened letters on the table...)
Traveler: (Read the first letter.)
Investigate (Letter #1): "Dear Earnshaw, sorry for being unable to contact you for so long. For various reasons, I moved to the Fortress of Meropide and have been living here for quite some time now."
Investigate (Letter #1): "Life here isn't so bad though! Though, the Tasses Ragout isn't as good as it is back home, and I don't have the company of any cute animals."
Investigate (Letter #1): "But I have something even more precious in my life now! Speaking of which, I might be able to return home fairly soon."
Investigate (Letter #1): "If the door is still open for me to return, please write me back! Even one sentence will do, just telling me how you're doing."
Traveler: (Read the second letter.)
Investigate (Letter #2): "You didn't write back. Are you still angry? Dad, listen to me. Don't be mad. Why punish yourself for someone else's mistake?"
Investigate (Letter #2): "Look, I'm the one at fault here. I know I've made mistakes, but that's all in the past now. We can have a fresh start."
Investigate (Letter #2): "My chronic illness has been flaring up again recently. Nothing like being unwell to make you appreciate the joys of being in good health, huh? I hope all is well with you."
Investigate (Letter #2): "If you really don't want to tell me how you've been doing, could you at least tell me about Prince, Princess, and Hero? Are they doing okay?"
Investigate (Letter #2): "I look forward to your response."
Traveler: (Read the third letter.)
Investigate (Letter #3): "You're really a stubborn one, Dad. I have some news I was planning to share with you when we saw each other, but I've decided to go ahead and tell you now."
Investigate (Letter #3): "That precious thing in my life I mentioned? Her name is Lanoire, and she's absolutely lovely. She's like a little flower sprouting out of a crack in the rock, determined to grow even in the absence of sunlight or rain."
Investigate (Letter #3): "I'd like to bring her home, I just know you'll adore her! Even if your door is closed to me, at the very least, please open it for her, even if just a crack, just to see her."
Investigate (Letter #3): "After that, I'll bring her to the Court of Fontaine. I'm going to work hard!"
Investigate (Letter #3): "She still hasn't had a good look at this world, so once we leave the Fortress of Meropide, I'm going to give her all the sunlight the world has to offer!"
Investigate (Letter #3): "Lutz won't let me write too much, so I'll leave it at that for now. Wishing you well!"
Traveler: (We should go...)
