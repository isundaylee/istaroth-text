Traveler: What issues?
Babisse: I'm designing a high-speed aquabus, but there's just one problem...
Babisse: After a period of high-speed operation, its internal components begin to vibrate intensely, damaging them...
Babisse: I've tried switching materials many times, but the problem remains. Is the problem with my design, then, or the materials?

Traveler: Could I see that aquabus?
Babisse: Eh? Well, the trial versions are all in my lab. I came out here to...
Babisse: To... Uh... find... materials...
Babisse: The God King even... assigned me a guard to... to... conduct research under his glorious banner... such happiness...

## Talk 4

Babisse: Speaking of cannonballs, the bigger the better, wouldn't you say?

Traveler: What would you need such a large cannonball for?
Babisse: Well, for people to sit in, of course, and soar into the skies via the giant cannon's propulsion!
Babisse: My design would have the cannonball be internally hollow, such that two... or even three people could sit inside.
Babisse: We'd need thick cushioning as well, so that we don't injure ourselves slamming into the walls of the projectile when it's fired.
Babisse: Of course, we'll also need adequate food, water, and a Kamera...

Traveler: Goodbye.
Babisse: Farewell! I wonder what material I should use to make this cannonball.

Traveler: Wait, wait! What will such a huge cannonball be made of?
Babisse: Hmmm, well, this is exactly the problem I meant to solve.
Babisse: I've prepared several experimental material types, and I plan to use each to make a projectile, each with small animals as... passengers.
Babisse: *sigh* Speaking of which, I must thank that gentleman for his "high-speed aquabus" idea. It's given me tons of inspiration.
Babisse: It's not exactly the same sort of "speed" as the cannonball's, of course, but there are still design ideas here that I can gainfully refer to.

Babisse: You have to... We have to look up at the sky and cease obsessing over Mora and tall towers. An empty space is where a researcher truly belongs...
