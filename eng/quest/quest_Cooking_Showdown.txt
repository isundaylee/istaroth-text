# Cooking Showdown


## Talk 1

Olaf: Uh... Are you sure this is Springvale?
Draff: Yes. For the millionth time, yes! But I don't know any of the people you're looking for.
Olaf: That is not possible, they all live in Springvale. They are my neighbors and friends.
Draff: This is strange, what is going on?
Traveler: Surely, it couldn't be...
Paimon: What is it?
Traveler: This hunter is also a survivor from 300 years ago.
Paimon: Whaaaat!? Can humans really live that long?
Xiangling: Er... Does that really make sense?
Traveler: He and the boar were both frozen.
Xiangling: Oh! Like the way that you keep food fresh!
Draff: Still, it's hard to believe...
Paimon: But it doesn't seem like there's any other sensible explanation.
Draff: Okay so... What's your name?
Olaf: Olaf.
Draff: Olaf? I'm sure I've seen that on my family tree!
Draff: I can't remember which generation it was from... but it was definitely on there.
Xiangling: So, a great-great-great-great grandfather, but with a whole load more greats?
Traveler: They don't look so distantly related.
Paimon: What an unusual turn of events!
Xiangling: Hee-hee, reunited at long last! Isn't that just amazing!?
Xiangling: Olaf, do you want to come and watch a cooking competition?
Draff: Ah yes, that reminds me — Brook told me about the competition, and I've set everything up at the venue.
Draff: You should come with me.
Traveler: The ice kept him fresh all this time, like with your ingredients.
Xiangling: Hee-hee, it all makes sense now that you're speaking my language!
Traveler: He's talking about Springvale a long, long time in the past.
Paimon: How long? ...Surely not hundreds of years!?
Traveler: I think I see what's going on here.

## Talk 2

Xiangling: We're ready to cook. Are you?
Brook: I was born ready. Oh, and Siegfria will be my assistant for the competition.
Draff: Then let the cooking commence! I will be your judge today.
Draff: And don't worry, I may have known Brook for longer, but I will remain entirely impartial.
Xiangling: #Much appreciated. Well then, {NICKNAME}, Paimon — prepare!
Paimon: Wait, we're taking part in this too?
Xiangling: Of course! If Brook has an assistant, you guys will have to be mine. I'll need you by my side when the going gets tough!
Paimon: *sigh* Paimon doesn't remember applying for that job...
Traveler: Well, I'm going to see this through.
Paimon: Okay. Paimon'll do it for the sake of the food.
Traveler: Ugh, I guess there's no backing out now...

## Talk 3

Xiangling: Our first problem is ingredients. We need something special to dress up the steak, but I don't have anything suitable here. Hmm...
Xiangling: I've got it! Radish is what we need. Mashed or grated, it'll add a touch of freshness.
Xiangling: And we can carve little flowers out of it as a garnish. Two birds, one stone!
Xiangling: Go find me a radish — there should be some in the area. Oh, and make sure you wash it because it's going straight into the dish!

## Talk 4

Xiangling: Wowee! Big and luscious. It's perfect. Thanks, you guys!
Xiangling: Now, how about...
Paimon: ...Xiangling! Look out, the pan's on fire!
Xiangling: Oh, no! It's gonna burn, it's gonna burn, it's gonna burn!!!
Xiangling: #{NICKNAME}, get the fire under control! Without using water though, or this dish is a goner!

## Talk 5

Xiangling: Whew, thanks! That was a close call, but I had a little taste and I think we can get away with it.
Xiangling: Also, I'm thinking our main is a little weak... We need to mix it up a bit.
Xiangling: Make me a Chicken-Mushroom Skewer. And make sure it's got that ooh la-la on the outside, then hits you with a cha-ching in the middle!
Traveler: Did not understand that one bit.
Paimon: Just make it taste <color=#00E1FFFF>friggin' awesome</color>!
Traveler: Paimon, translate for me!

## Talk 6

Xiangling: Ugh, this is practically charcoal now... Wah, I'm gonna have to start from scratch.
Xiangling: Also, I'm thinking our main is a little weak... We need to mix it up a bit.
Xiangling: Make me a Chicken-Mushroom Skewer. And make sure it's got that ooh la-la on the outside, then hits you with a cha-ching in the middle!
Traveler: Did not understand that one bit.
Paimon: Just make it taste <color=#00E1FFFF>friggin' awesome</color>!
Traveler: Paimon, translate for me!

## Talk 7

Xiangling: #Mmm! {NICKNAME}, you're a natural!
Xiangling: The meat is on track, but we're aiming for perfection here and I just think it lacks a certain...
Paimon: A certain what?
Xiangling: A certain... boom shaka-laka!
Paimon: Yes! Definitely needs some boom shaka-laka — or perhaps a little shaka-laka boom-pow!
Traveler: Again, how is this making sense to you!?
Xiangling: I just mean it would be a waste of such amazing ingredients to just serve this as-is.
Xiangling: Let me see... Hmm, what would be ideal is some kind of regional specialty.
Paimon: Regional specialty?
Xiangling: Yes, something that's native to this area but isn't often used in cooking.
Xiangling: I don't care if it flies, crawls, or bounces. Even insects I can work with...
Paimon: Uh, interesting choice...
Xiangling: Hmm, I'm sure I can make something of it!
Paimon: Alright then...
Traveler: Is that really from an obscure Liyue dialect or did you just make it up?

## Talk 8

Xiangling: Thanks, you guys! Now show me what you got!
Traveler: Give cooking ingredients to Xiangling
Traveler: Let me keep looking...
Xiangling: Sorry to keep you running back and forth.
Xiangling: What I need is a living being, one you wouldn't normally cook with.
Xiangling: It can fly, it can crawl, or it can bounce. Even insects are fair game!
Xiangling: It might be a challenge to find... I'm sure you're up to it!

## Talk 9

Paimon: Do you really want to add that?
Paimon: It's a little... odd...
Xiangling: It'll be fine. This was an excellent find, guys! Now, if you'll excuse me, Chef Xiangling needs to concentrate.
Xiangling: But I'll be sure to annoy you again if I need anything else, hee-hee!

## Talk 10

Xiangling: I almost forgot — side dish! We need a side dish!
Traveler: Allow me!
Xiangling: Are you sure it's no trouble?
Xiangling: Here, take this. I just scrawled it down at the last minute.
Xiangling: And here are all the ingredients you need.
Paimon: Is this the <color=#00E1FFFF>recipe</color> for that snack you gave us earlier!?
Xiangling: Yes, with some minor improvements so it uses up the leftover ingredients from Liyue.
Paimon: This is so complicated... How are we supposed to cook this with no experience?
Xiangling: The technique doesn't matter — what matters is that you do it with passion! That's what my father taught me.
Xiangling: And you must be passionate about cooking if you've helped me this much already.
Xiangling: I trust you guys. I know you'll nail this side dish!
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Xiangling: Confident, I like it!
Xiangling: Come on, this is the final push!
Traveler: I hope I don't cramp your style...
Xiangling: Don't be so negative. Cooking is fun! Just relax and enjoy it.
Traveler: You'd make me do it even if I didn't offer...
Xiangling: Thanks! Hee-hee, you know me too well.

## Talk 11

Draff: Fusion cuisine that blends elements of Mondstadt and Liyue cooking... I am excited.

## Talk 12

Xiangling: Are the Jade Parcels ready yet?
Xiangling: Flavor is key, but you also don't want to take too long over it. Once they're ready, bring them here and I'll serve the dish!

## Talk 13

Xiangling: Mmm! They're so fragrant I could smell them coming a mile away.
Xiangling: We're all set! And now to serve the meal — this competition is ours!

## Talk 14

Draff: This was a fine feast. I have dined today like I have never dined before.
Draff: Both chefs' dishes today were nothing short of exceptional. They were true masterpieces. And that is what makes this an extremely difficult decision.
Draff: But, this is a competition and there can only be one winner — and that winner is...
Draff: Xiangling!
Xiangling: Whoopee! I win!
Brook: *sigh* I thought I was sure to win with pork chops so fresh they were practically still grunting.
Brook: But it turns out that's still no match for the taste of extinct boar.
Draff: Excuse me? Did you say this was cooked from extinct boar!?
Xiangling: Yep, every last bit!
Draff: My goodness... A single mouthful must be worth a hundred thousand Mora!
Draff: The amount you'd make if you sold this could support every hunter in town for years to come!
Xiangling: Hee-hee, the main thing is that you enjoyed eating it. I don't care about the Mora.
Xiangling: Anyway, now that our judge has given his verdict, it's time for everyone else to eat too. I made plenty!
Xiangling: Meanwhile, I want to try Brook's dish.
Brook: This is absolutely delicious... I'll admit it, I was beaten by the best.
Siegfria: Losing is no fun, but it was worth it for the chance to eat such superb cooking! Please Xiangling, I want some more!
Xiangling: This is gorgeous too! Such a perfectly layered texture.
Xiangling: Were it not for that exquisite boar and excellent side dish, it's hard to say if I still would have won.
Paimon: Paimon's turn to eat!
Olaf: I will have a taste too.
Olaf: Oh... My oh my... This is...
Olaf: This is the taste of Springvale! ...Or rather... it used to be.
Traveler: It tastes so good I want to weep tears of joy.
Olaf: *sob* This is the last time I will be able to taste the food of my era...
Xiangling: Hey now... Cheer up, if you like the taste I can always make you some more!
Olaf: ...Really? But the boar... it's extinct...
Xiangling: The boar may be, but the taste isn't! I can simply recreate it using different ingredients.
Xiangling: Putting a smile on customers' faces is what we chefs are called to do!
Olaf: Th—Thank you... *sob*

## Talk 15

Xiangling: Thanks, you guys. Without your help, I don't know how it would have gone today.
Paimon: And without you, Paimon wouldn't have gotten to try so many new tasty snacks!
Paimon: Also wouldn't have gotten so full...
Traveler: Where will you go now?
Xiangling: Not sure. I'll probably start heading back to Liyue, but I might change my plan on the way.
Xiangling: I don't like to plan things too thoroughly.
Xiangling: Who knows, maybe you'll bump into me out in the wild again!
Paimon: Must be nice to be so carefree.
Xiangling: #You are a gifted chef, {NICKNAME}. You made an amazing batch of Jade Parcels.
Xiangling: Come and visit me at the Wanmin Restaurant some time. I did promise I'd cook for you!
Xiangling: And if you want, I'll teach you how to cook some of my latest inventions too.
Traveler: It's a deal!
Xiangling: You have a deal!
Xiangling: #Hee-hee, see you again soon, {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: I'll pass on the slime jus though...
Xiangling: How did you know what dish I was thinking of!?
