# Orobashi's Legacy: Part V


## Talk 1

Kaji: Thanks for your efforts. Although the island is still full of dangers, this will give a little hope to all the people who have left their hometown and long to return.
Kaji: The fact that the rain has stopped may actually make the warring parties more aggressive in fighting for the island...
Kaji: But they were never going to help resolve the situation on the island anyway. What we have done is at least better than leaving the problem to fester.
Kaji: Now, the gift I promised you.
Kaji: This is the famed spear once used by the Prefects of Yashiori. Now, I'm not sure how much use this drawing will be to you...
Kaji: But if you give it to a sufficiently skilled smith, they should be able to recreate the glory it once had in Lord Kitain's hands.
Kaji: *sigh* Alas, the age of heroes has come and gone, and the Kitain, who once destroyed so many evils, will never return again.
Kaji: Still, we seem to have gotten a step closer to matching Lord Kitain's deeds in the present, thanks to your help.
Kaji: Next, I will go to my friends in the Shogunate army to see if there's anything I can help with. I hope to see you again in the future.
