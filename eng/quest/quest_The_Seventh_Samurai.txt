# "The Seventh Samurai"


## Talk 1

Xavier: Wait! Ah, Sir Soldier, the line you just read lacks the right emotional gravitas.
Xavier: "Samurai, like the wind sweeping the earth."
Xavier: Do you still remember what I said about the play? It is supposed to feel liberating and give the audience a sense of the vicissitudes of life. I said liberating! Liberating, you understand?
Xavier: This line is key to the whole play. You must express your emotions completely, fully, and perfectly!
Toranosuke: Uh...
Xavier: Moreover, don't swing your sword in such haste... Make sure you are in view, otherwise, the Film Kamera will not be able to capture your movements at all.
Xavier: Pose, and then pause, okay? Stop for a moment, then slice downwards with great force.
Toranosuke: But you can't swing your sword like that when you fight against people...
Xavier: True, but you have to tailor your acting to the production's needs.
Xavier: Well then. Please ready up, and we shall give this another go...
Traveler: What are you doing?
Xavier: #Oh, it's you! Ah, my dear {F#girl}{M#boy}, a fair wind must have blown you here.
Xavier: As you can see, I'm shooting a swashbuckler film with our good soldier here. I call it "The Seventh Samurai."
Xavier: Oh, "swashbuckler film" is what I'm calling films of this genre.
Xavier: This sort of film shall have sword-fighting scenes, and it shall take the viewers on an incredible journey across the battlefield... Well, that's the idea, at least!
Traveler: To think that Mr. Toranosuke would have time...
Toranosuke: This activity has been approved by our superiors. According to them, it will help to increase the Shogunate's prestige.
Toranosuke: That said, I haven't a clue how Mr. Xavier managed to convince them...
Xavier: Honestly, Mr. Mikoshi Genjirou is such a... serious man. Fortunately, he is also most understanding.
Xavier: After I had a sincere talk with him, he accepted my request quite happily.
Xavier: But... In exchange, I have to make a movie that has to do with the Shogunate, preferably with a samurai as the protagonist.
Xavier: But I was always interested in this sort of subject matter anyway, so of course, I agreed to it, and Lord Mikoshi Genjirou was also very pleased.
Xavier: In addition to personally appointing our good soldier to go with me, he also assigned some skilled troops to me, and then he said...
Xavier: "Use these scenes of steel clashing against steel to display the majesty of the samurai and the Shogunate."
Xavier: I have to say that Mr. Genjirou really is a man of vision, to have grasped the potential of using films as a marketing tool so very quickly...
Xavier: And as for me, I will never refuse anything that will help me make my films.
Traveler: Is production going well?
Xavier: To be honest, it's not going that well...
Xavier: While these soldiers are highly skilled in martial arts, they are not used to this kind of staged fighting.
Xavier: Not only are their sword movements too fast for the Film Kamera to record, they sometimes even run outside of its view.
Xavier: Traveler, if you have the time, do you mind following my script and acting the story out for the soldiers to see?
Xavier: I believe that with your strength and understanding, you will be able to perform brilliantly in front of the Kamera...
Xavier: They should be able to better understand the story after watching it from the spectator's point of view.
Xavier: Come, come! Just read the script and the lines first. This part is mainly about fighting...
Traveler: "The battle is lost."
Xavier: Ah, these are lines from another scene... This one is mainly about fighting, so there aren't that many lines.
Traveler: Alright, let me take a look at the script.
Xavier: Oh, by the way, you'll be playing the role of "Juusaburou." Together with several companions, he is employed by the villagers to protect their village...
Xavier: In this scene, one of your companions, "Kyuuzou," has lines... I'll play his part, and the two of us will do a reading.
Xavier: Now, you must embody the role, understand it! Just think of yourself as Juusaburou. Do you understand?
Traveler: I understand, Director.
Xavier: Wonderful! Splendid! Bravo!
Xavier: Let me know when you are ready. I have to adjust the Film Kamera's position...
Traveler: I. Am. Juusaburou.
Traveler: "But even when imperiled, the samurai is still samurai."
Traveler: "You are all certified scarecrows..."
Traveler: "...But our enemies are not sparrows."
Traveler: Mind if I play a part?
Xavier: #Of course! Of course! You are, after all, forever a {F#heroine}{M#hero} in my heart!
Xavier: I'll always remember that "Tatara Tales" that we acted in together.
Xavier: Although these soldiers are highly skilled in martial arts, they are not used to this kind of staged fighting.
Xavier: Not only are their sword movements too fast for the Film Kamera to record, they sometimes even run outside of its view.
Traveler: How did you persuade him to help you out?
Xavier: Come now, our dear soldier understood me just fine. My main job, really, was to persuade Mr. Mikoshi Genjirou to allow me to make a film in Inazuma.
Traveler: "Samurai, like the wind sweeping the earth."
Xavier: You said those words with too much passion. It should be...

## Talk 2

Xavier: So, are you ready?

## Talk 3

Xavier: Oh dear me, this film doesn't seem to have come out right...
Xavier: Please get ready again, and we shall give it another go.

## Talk 4

Toranosuke: A "swashbuckler film," huh. Mr. Xavier sure does have interesting taste in names.
Traveler: What do you think of these films?
Toranosuke: Our superiors believe that these films will help to increase the Shogunate's prestige.
Toranosuke: Perhaps I am simply a little slow on the uptake... but I do not see how this is the case.
Toranosuke: This script is full of these... pessimistic lines. There is nothing of samurai dignity here.
Toranosuke: Who knows what they were thinking, that they agreed to all this...
Traveler: How's the situation at the Mikage Furnace?
Toranosuke: Ever since Sir Hanbei's "promotion," Yousuke has taken over as the person in charge.
Toranosuke: He is a craftsman by birth and trade, and is very down-to-earth and steady. He gets things done, as well.
Toranosuke: With the Mikage Furnace under his management, I doubt there will be any further problems.

## Talk 5

Xavier: #Perfect! As expected of the {F#heroine}{M#hero} of my heart! A perfect demonstration! You truly are a star!
Traveler: A... what now?
Xavier: A star! That is to say, the most important actor in a film.
Xavier: Now then, Mr. Soldier. You saw that demonstration clearly, I trust?
Toranosuke: On the whole, yes. When swinging my blade, I should focus not so much on the "action," itself, but on the "posture," yes?
Toranosuke: If you only require the "posture"... I have some ideas about that.
Xavier: Oh? That's wonderful! Please discuss the matter with your fellow soldiers, and we'll do another take in a while.
Xavier: You have my utmost gratitude for your help, Traveler. Here. These are for you.
Traveler: What's the theme of your next film?
Xavier: The next film, hmm? Well... Actually, I'm quite torn on what its topic should be myself.
Xavier: Should we do one about the various traditions of the Grand Narukami Shrine? Or the tales of the kitsune and the tanuki?
Xavier: There are so many islands here in Inazuma, and so many stories to be told!
Xavier: But regardless, I have to finish producing "The Seventh Samurai" first.
Xavier: If this satisfies those fellows upstairs, I do suspect that future film projects shall progress much more smoothly.
Traveler: Maybe I'd like to change roles next time.
Xavier: No problem at all! Once this film has been completed, we should start planning a whole new one.
