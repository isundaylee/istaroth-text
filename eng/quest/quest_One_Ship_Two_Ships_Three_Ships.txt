# One Ship, Two Ships, Three Ships...


## Talk 1

Linling: Shoot, I can't remember... Two — no, four, plus... seven...? Nope, that wasn't it...
Linling: Ugh! This is such a waste of my time!
Traveler: What are you counting?
Linling: I'm totaling up the number of boats that came into and went out of the docks yesterday... If I get the wrong figures again I'll never hear the end of it!
Linling: I was so busy writing poetry yesterday that I totally forgot about it... and now I'm rushing to get this done at the last minute.
Linling: I hate doing this. How do they expect me to keep track when there's an endless stream of ships going in and out of the docks all day long? For each one I note down there's another that I miss.
Linling: And 'cause I have to count all these boats, then check and double-check the numbers, I now have no time to work on my poetry... It is really ruining my day!
Linling: ...I know! Maybe you can help me count up yesterday's boats? I need to know how many came in and how many went out.
Traveler: Okay.
Linling: Yay! Thanks!
Linling: ...I was supposed to have a colleague helping, but...
Linling: Ooh, ooh, I have an idea! There's these three kids who I always see playing down by the docks.
Linling: I bet you they'll remember how many boats came and went yesterday...
Linling: That said, they are only kids. So to be on the safe side, you should ask all three of them and check their stories match.
Linling: Well then. I will leave you to interrogate the minors and report back to me when you're done. Over and out.
Traveler: As long as it's ten or under...
Linling: Oh please! You have toes, don't you? Anything up to and including twenty and you have no grounds to complain!
Linling: I know I can count on you!

## Talk 2

Little Lulu: What are we gonna play today...
Little Lulu: Hello! What are you doing?
Traveler: Cast your mind back to yesterday...
Little Lulu: Yesterday? Hmm... I only remember <color=#00E1FFFF>one big boat came in yesterday morning</color>.
Little Lulu: Fei said it was definitely a Millelith boat and Meng thought it might be a cargo boat.
Little Lulu: But I think it looked so amazing it must have been a Liyue Qixing boat.
Little Lulu: Will you remember? ...You know what, let me <color=#00E1FFFF>write that down</color> for you.
Little Lulu: Isn't my handwriting really good? Here you go — and make sure you don't lose it!

## Talk 3

Little Lulu: Boys are so dumb...
Little Lulu: Oh, hi! What're you up to?
Traveler: I'm just here to ask a few questions...
Little Lulu: Erm... I can't remember. Wait... I think <color=#00E1FFFF>two boats came in yesterday morning</color>.
Little Lulu: They were only small boats and they didn't look like most of the ones in the city...
Little Lulu: Will you remember? ...You know what, let me <color=#00E1FFFF>write that down</color> for you.
Little Lulu: Isn't my handwriting really good? Here you go — and make sure you don't lose it!

## Talk 4

Little Lulu: Hello! Have you come to play with us?
Little Lulu: ...You're not here to play games, are you?
Traveler: I'm here about what you saw yesterday...
Little Lulu: Yesterday? <color=#00E1FFFF>No boats came in or went out yesterday morning</color>, so the men who work at the docks had nothing to do.
Little Lulu: But they still didn't go home. They just kept waiting at the docks all day long.
Little Lulu: I don't get it. If they didn't have any work, why didn't they just go home? It's so weird...
Little Lulu: Will you remember? ...You know what, let me <color=#00E1FFFF>write that down</color> for you.
Little Lulu: Isn't my handwriting really good? Here you go — and make sure you don't lose it!

## Talk 5

Little Fei: I'm never gonna get to be the captain...
Little Fei: Hi! Are you looking for me?
Traveler: How well do you remember yesterday...
Little Fei: Erm, I wasn't really paying attention. I just remember that <color=#00E1FFFF>one big boat went out yesterday at noon</color>.
Little Fei: You wanna know why I only remember what happened at noon?
Little Fei: Meng and Lulu went to buy Lotus Heads yesterday at noon. I stayed here on my own to guard our spot.
Little Fei: Of course I had to guard our spot. Otherwise someone might steal it!
Little Fei: What's wrong? You look confused.
Little Fei: That's all I remember. ...Oh, go on then, I'll <color=#00E1FFFF>put it in writing</color> for you.
Little Fei: But don't blame me if something goes wrong. My memory is not so good...

## Talk 6

Little Fei: What're we playing today?
Little Fei: Oh hi. What's up?
Traveler: Sir, I just have a few questions...
Little Fei: <color=#00E1FFFF>Two boats came in yesterday at lunchtime</color>.
Little Fei: They were both going really fast. I bet it was an emergency delivery.
Little Fei: That's all I remember. ...Oh, go on then, I'll <color=#00E1FFFF>put it in writing</color> for you.
Little Fei: But don't blame me if something goes wrong. My memory is not so good...

## Talk 7

Little Fei: Hmph, when will it be my turn...
Little Fei: Oh. Hi. Are you looking for me?
Traveler: Boats. Yesterday. What can you tell me?
Little Fei: I don't really remember. No wait... I did notice <color=#00E1FFFF>3 boats came in yesterday at noon</color>.
Little Fei: And then loads of people went over to unload all the stuff... The sailors made us get out of the way.
Little Fei: That's all I remember. ...Oh, go on then, I'll <color=#00E1FFFF>put it in writing</color> for you.
Little Fei: But don't blame me if something goes wrong. My memory is not so good...

## Talk 8

Little Meng: I can't wait till I'm a grown up...
Little Meng: Oh hi. You need something?
Traveler: I need to know what you witnessed yesterday...
Little Meng: The boats? If I remember right, <color=#00E1FFFF>no boats came in or went out yesterday evening</color>.
Little Meng: And I have a good memory. I know what I saw.
Little Meng: Here, take this <color=#00E1FFFF>Note</color>. Consider it my written testimony. Don't lose it now!
Little Meng: Just like my daddy always says, a word in the head is worth two in the brush! Wait... no, that's not it...

## Talk 9

Little Meng: When I grow up, I wanna travel the whole world...
Little Meng: Oh, hello. What're you doing here?
Traveler: I need to know what you saw yesterday...
Little Meng: Yesterday... Uh... I'm sorry, I just remember <color=#00E1FFFF>1 boat went out yesterday evening</color>.
Little Meng: Yesterday morning I went to go pick some Lotus Heads for Lulu and Fei.
Little Meng: But I lost track of time and it was already evening when I got back...
Little Meng: I don't think it was a waste though. 'Cause Lulu and Fei got to eat Lotus Heads, didn't they?
Little Meng: Here, take this <color=#00E1FFFF>Note</color>. Consider it my written testimony. Don't lose it now!
Little Meng: Just like my daddy always says, a word in the head is worth two in the brush! Wait... no, that's not it...

## Talk 10

Little Meng: I wish there was a way I could grow up faster...
Little Meng: Hello! What are you doing today?
Traveler: Counting boats. About that...
Little Meng: Hmm, lemme think... I just remember <color=#00E1FFFF>3 boats came in yesterday evening</color>.
Little Meng: The boats had really bright lights on, and there were loads of people at the dock. I think they were all waiting for those boats.
Little Meng: Lulu and Fei went home, but I stayed to watch those boats for ages.
Little Meng: If you could get on a boat like that... Surely you could go anywhere you wanted to...
Little Meng: Here, take this <color=#00E1FFFF>Note</color>. Consider it my written testimony. Don't lose it now!
Little Meng: Just like my daddy always says, a word in the head is worth two in the brush! Wait... no, that's not it...
