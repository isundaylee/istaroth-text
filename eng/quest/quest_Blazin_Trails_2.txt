# Blazin' Trails


## Talk 1

Paimon: We've done everything we can, but how do we deal with the last two mountains?
Xinyan: Let's stick to it. There's gotta be a way.
Mona: After taking a closer look, it seems to me that most of the island mountains contain water veins and plants in their interior. Those together form a system that connects the mountains with one another.
Mona: However, now that much of the mountains have collapsed, the connection of plants and water veins is blocked.
Kaedehara Kazuha: If we can dredge all the blockages, we will be able to connect the islands to form the giant instrument described in Albedo's notes, and play music using the islands themselves.
Xinyan: Yep, for me to reach my goal, we gotta do this... But first, I'd like to consult the flower. It should know what to do.

## Talk 2

Xinyan: Some of the plants and water veins on the island mountains have been lost. Do you happen to know another way to dredge the blockages?
Blazing Heart: I know someone who can help you with that. Go ask my companion, Frozen Soul, who lives upstairs.

## Talk 3

Frozen Soul: Who are you, and what brings you to me?
Xinyan: Nice to meet you. We were wondering if we could use your power to dredge the mountains on the island.
Frozen Soul: Mountains? Oh, I see... you want to become great musicians too, right?
Paimon: Oh? Is that what this is about?
Xinyan: Correct.
Frozen Soul: In that case, we seek the same thing. Despite my frailty, I feel obligated to share some of my power with you.
Frozen Soul: Plant my petal at the ending point of the intersection of melodies, and what had once sunk into the earth will re-emerge with the music. As long as there is music, life will continue to flourish in this world.
Xinyan: ...Thank you.

## Talk 4

Xinyan: Can you feel anything, now that we've planted the petal?
Frozen Soul: Yes, I can feel it. The sun is shining brightly, the sea gleams like a gemstone, the waves lap the milky-white beaches, and the grains of sand are pulled into the sea, then pushed back ashore...
Frozen Soul: ...the seabirds are landing on the rocks, pecking gently and making rhythmic sounds. ♪ dum-dum, dum-dum ♪...
Xinyan: It's music.
Frozen Soul: This is indeed music. In fact, this whole island is a giant musical instrument. Since you are a musician, you should be able to understand the meaning behind its original creation.
Xinyan: Making music with the tides, waves, and sea breeze as your instruments is the most romantic thing in the world.
Xinyan: Let's go, everyone. It's time for my performance.

## Talk 5

Xinyan: ...
Xinyan: Finally, the time has come.
Xinyan: Everyone, I once made a wish to perform with someone no one could have expected. And today, on this island, I've found my answer.
Xinyan: No one knows the name or appearance of the man who transformed this island into a giant musical instrument so many years ago, but he is unquestionably one of Teyvat's greatest musicians.
Xinyan: I never imagined I'd be able to see such an instrument, and I never imagined we'd be able to play it during a high tide.
Traveler: Are you going to play some rock 'n' roll?
Xinyan: No.
Xinyan: Music is the gift one gives to their kindred spirit, so... I'll play something that makes for a better duet with the original musician.
Xinyan: No rock music for today. Instead, I'm gonna show you something new!
Xinyan: ...Phew.
Xinyan: How was it? Not bad, huh?
Mona: Quite impressive.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I've never heard a duet like that before. It was very interesting.
Paimon: And so elegant as well! Paimon's not sure how best to put it... But it was just super unique.
Traveler: A performance with a lot of personality.
Xinyan: Hehe, thank you.
Xinyan: And now I can say my wish has come true.
Mona: Is there anything else you'd like to do?
Xinyan: No, in fact, I reckon I'll get a good night's sleep tonight.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Does this mean everyone is free for the time being? If so, I have a suggestion.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I'd like to return to the Fatui camp, and see what's going on there.
Mona: Oh? So you've discovered the Fatui camp as well.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Wait, you know about it too?
Mona: Of course, I'm a genius astrologist. Didn't I mention that my scryglass has recovered a little? I can sense what's going on here through divination.
Xinyan: Uh, I didn't know the Fatui were here too.
Mona: Indeed. I also informed Fischl of this when we parted ways today. If she runs into them, she'll stay hidden and out of danger.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I see, then perhaps we should tell everyone what we know.
Black Screen Text: You tell everyone about the Fatui camp and the strange machine you found on the day you arrived...
Mona: A strange machine, and delirious Fatui...? Are you suggesting these are connected to the mirage?
Kaedehara Kazuha: I can't say I'm certain, but I don't believe they are completely unrelated.
Xinyan: Fair enough. Let's go check out the camp.
Traveler: A performance with a lot of charm.

## Talk 6

Paimon: It's strange that on our way here, we've only run into local monsters, and no Fatui.
Mona: How bizarre... there are still signs of the camp, and the machine is still here, but all the people have vanished.
Traveler: (This machine must have something to do with the mirages. Sure, it's broken, but maybe that itself is the cause.)
Traveler: (...But if the machine can cause people to hallucinate, why did they vanish? Is there anything else going on?)
Traveler: (Did they disappear, or are they hiding from us?)
Mona: I give up — I'm just going to divine the answer.
Mona: ...
Mona: What's this...? Some kind of energy flow?
Mona: Sorry, everyone, I can't seem to find any trace of the Fatui. My scryglass has gotten hazy again, but this time, I can sense some sort of energy converging and taking physical form.
Mona: The destination is... the island over there.
Xinyan: Whose mirage will it be this time?
Mona: Hmm... let's head over and have a look. Maybe we'll be able to find something there.

## Talk 7

Kaedehara Kazuha: Here we are.
Mona: Huh? Fischl?
Fischl: ...
Paimon: It's really her! Hey, Fischl—!
Fischl: ...Hmph, my imprudent retainers, you've finally arrived.
Oz: O—Oh my, long time no see!
Xinyan: It hasn't been that long, has it?
Oz: Ahem... Mein Fräulein and I sensed a peculiar aura, and came here ahead of time to reunite with everyone. We weren't expecting you... Well, what I mean to say is, you arrived sooner than we expected.
Paimon: Is it just Paimon, or does Oz seem nervous?
Fischl: The advent of the Immernachtreich is imminent, and I still need to prepare for the consecration.
Oz: Mein Fräulein, are you sure you—
Fischl: I am quite capable of acting on my own, Oz. If you're weary of the encroaching darkness of the night, you're quite welcome to return to the blinding brightness of the day.
Oz: Please, mein Fräulein, do not say such things. I am your loyal attendant, your eyes, and I will never leave your side.
Fischl: ...Stop staring at me like that! A—Anyway, the time of explanation... is not yet upon us, hmph!
Oz: Oh, mein Fräulein!
Oz: I do apologize, everyone. Mein Fräulein is having a rough day — please do not take it to heart. I must also excuse myself now.
Mona: ...Huh, still no improvement in her mood, even after all this time away from the group.
Mona: As soon as I saw Fischl, I realized that the mirage that's about to take shape here must have something to do with her.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes. I, at least, felt a peculiar sense of familiarity when I approached my mirage.
Xinyan: Me too. Even though it didn't really make sense, I just had a feeling that something exciting was gonna happen.
Mona: Exactly, if Fischl and Oz can also sense something, then our suspicions are likely to be right on the Mora... Fischl's probably agitated because she doesn't want to confront her mirage.
Paimon: How come?
Mona: Maybe her mirage conceals some secrets that she doesn't want anyone to know about.
Mona: Let's all take a rest here for now. When the mirage appears, we will get to the bottom of this mystery.
