Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?

Fischl: Stalled have I the inexorable march of time and veiled the omnipresent gaze of fate.
Fischl: Traveler from beyond, the sovereign Prinzessin shall arbitrate the discord of thine heart!
Oz: What mein Fräulein means is that she happens to be free right now.
Oz: If there is something on your mind, she is happy to listen.
Traveler: Actually, I want to know if anything is bothering you, Fischl.
Fischl: Preposterous! I am the Prinzessin der Verurteilung! What mortal follies could venture to imprint themselves upon my psyche?
Oz: When I was out on reconnaissance, didn't the new recruits from the Adventurers' Guild joke about you since they couldn't understand what you were saying?
Oz: I remember that you were distressed about this, mein Fräulein.
Fischl: Nonsense! How could I be perturbed by such trifling antics from my retinue?
Fischl: Alas, I lament that those neophytes lack semblance to you, traveler from an outer world, the one delivered before me by the threads of fate.
Fischl: The one who perceives the truth and meaning of my declarations.
Traveler: You offer a surfeit of praise.
Fischl: Yes, indeed do I perceive rightly...
Fischl: By my regard, should Oz be conducting reconnaissance on my behalf, I grant you permission to remain in my propinquity.
Fischl: Now, relay the will of the Prinzessin to her attendants!
Oz: Frankly, I also think this is a good idea.
Traveler: What if my understanding is off?
Fischl: Allay all doubt, for you are the one that I, the Prinzessin, have personally appointed. Hesitate not and proclaim my decrees to this world's denizens!
Traveler: If you two say so...
Fischl: So shall it be.
Fischl: Rejoice! That wanton brume of devilry hath dissipated beneath my immaculate radiance!
Traveler: I am honored to understand you.
