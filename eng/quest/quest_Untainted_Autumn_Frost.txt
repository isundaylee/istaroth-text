# Untainted Autumn Frost


## Talk 1

Shenhe: #Hello, {NICKNAME}.
Paimon: Hi there! Paimon would be more surprised to see you if we hadn't already seen a bunch of our friends...
Paimon: Huh!? Wait, you're Shenhe! This is a surprise!
Shenhe: This place isn't easy to find. Angel's Share... The name doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.
Shenhe: Mr. Zhongli was kind enough to help me with directions. I'm thankful.
Paimon: You needed help with directions?... Wait, you came all this way just for a drink?
Shenhe: That's right.
Shenhe: Because... we're friends.
Traveler: What would you like?
Paimon: Here's the menu!
Shenhe: Boreal Watch... Hmm, Boreal? As in a cold climate?
Paimon: Well, Boreal Watch here probably is referring to the Wolf of the North. So yeah, you could say it's cold.
Shenhe: Caramel Pinecone... How could that be a drink?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon's tried that one. It's actually caramel flavored coffee. "Pinecone" just refers to the color!
Shenhe: Huh...
Shenhe: These names are confusing. I can't make sense of any of these.
Shenhe: I'll leave it up to you. As long as it's something that tastes like Qingxin or Violetgrass.
Paimon: Those medicinal herbs don't grow around here. If you want something bitter, then it'd have to be coffee...
Traveler: How about something sweet instead?
Shenhe: Fine.
Paimon: That's a good idea. You've practiced the adepti arts long enough. It's time for something new!
Paimon: Let's make Shenhe a Snow-Covered Kiss! It sounds like a perfect fit for her.

## Talk 2

Shenhe: Hmm, it's sweet and smooth. Not bitter at all. What is it?
Paimon: It's called a Snow-Covered Kiss! Whisk milk until it froths, and then gently pour it over some juice. It looks like it's covered by a layer of snow.
Paimon: Don't ask why it's called a kiss, though... Paimon doesn't get it either. It's probably just a gimmick to get it to sell better!
Shenhe: A gimmick?
Paimon: Uh, Paimon's just guessing... Maybe it's more of a romantic description!
Shenhe: Romantic?
Paimon: Uhh... It's hard to explain! Stop making Paimon come up with things.
Traveler: The milky foam doesn't have much taste to it...
Paimon: Mm-hmm, that's right.
Traveler: The moment you taste the sweetness of the juice...
Shenhe: ...Oh.
Shenhe: I see. I seem to understand now.
Paimon: Oh? Really?
Paimon: But wait, why is Paimon the one who's confused now!?
Shenhe: Occasionally, I chew on divine herbs as I wander about in the mountains. I have witnessed the moment a new sprout breaks through the soil.
Shenhe: The elation in my heart then does bear a resemblance to what I'm experiencing now.
Shenhe: #Thank you for helping me understand these obscure names, {NICKNAME}.
Shenhe: I might need your help again sometime in the future.
Traveler: Like a sprout pushing through the ice to give you a kiss...
Traveler: It's kind of like snow on the mountains...
