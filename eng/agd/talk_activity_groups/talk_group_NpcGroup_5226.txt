Traveler: About this pier...
Aigouy: The Fortress of Meropide has lots of pipelines. Someone needs to maintain them, don't they? That's our job.
Aigouy: It's mostly minor repairs, patching this and that up. I mean, what do they expect someone like me to do if something major happens, anyway?
Aigouy: I just do what I'm able to, like taking letters into the city for people when I have a day off...

Traveler: Thanks for your time.
Aigouy: Oh, I have no shortage of time. Not like I'm even remotely busy.
