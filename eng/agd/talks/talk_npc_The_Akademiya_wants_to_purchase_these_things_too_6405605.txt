Traveler: The Akademiya wants to purchase these things too...?
Zohreh: That's right. After all, researchers, students, and other staff also need to sleep and eat.
Zohreh: The Akademiya may have a handle on knowledge, but they still depend on the people for production and need to purchase daily supplies from the private sector on a regular basis.
Zohreh: In return, the Akademiya will also provide free healthcare to all and helps foot the bill for any festivals and celebrations that may need to be held.
