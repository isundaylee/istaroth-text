Traveler: Are you alright?
Canotila: Thank you. If it wasn't for you, I might never have made it back.
Canotila: Merusea Village is beautiful, and everyone is really nice. I should treasure life here a little more, and the "world" around me.
Canotila: Perhaps, the world of "meditation" is not as wonderful as I once thought?
