Library Rules: "Library Rules - Seventh Edition"
Library Rules: "There were several editions of the library rules, but none of them were particularly useful."
Library Rules: "So all unnecessary rules were abandoned in this edition. All users of the library should obey the following rules:"
Library Rules: "1. Please keep quiet in the library."
Library Rules: "2. Please do not damage the books."
Library Rules: "3. Please remember to return your books on time."
Library Rules: "I believe everyone knows how we deal with violations, so it will not be repeated here."
Library Rules: "We hope everyone can abide by the above rules and make good use of the library."
