Traveler: And you are...?
Bossuet: Hmm? You've not heard of me? Well, I suppose you don't look like researchers on the cutting edge either.
Bossuet: Bossuet's the name. I once worked at the Fontaine Research Institute.
Bossuet: If you have time to visit the Institute, I'm sure you'll find many an academic achievement credited to me, and researchers who have received my mentorship.
Bossuet: Ah, but that said, I'm not providing professional guidance at the moment.
Bossuet: I've retired from my research post, and am here in peaceful retirement. If you wanted professional aid, I fear I must disappoint you.
