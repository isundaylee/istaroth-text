## Talk

Araby: Hello.
Araby: Sorry, I'm observing the sea and can't talk much.

## Talk

Traveler: And you are...
Araby: I'm an Amu{RUBY#[S]Biology}rta researcher from the Akademiya, primarily studying sea creatures.
Araby: And responsible for the upkeep of the lighthouse while at it.
Araby: To be honest, I know very little about lighthouses. It's the Kshahrewar researchers who are the experts...
Araby: I can't figure out why the sages would make such an arrangement... Probably because I was here already.

## Talk

Traveler: I'll leave you to it, then.
Araby: Yeah, see you.

## Talk

Traveler: About the sages...
Araby: The sages enjoy the highest status in Akademiya. There is one per school, six in all.
Araby: The sages assign jobs to us researchers.
Araby: Just like I was sent to monitor the ocean and watch the lighthouse.
Araby: It's basically a boring job when there's no sea creatures. The only positive side is its security.

## Talk

Traveler: About Kshahrewar...
Araby: Kshahrewar encompasses many sub-genres. Architecture is just one of them.
Araby: If I studied architecture, I could explain how the lighthouse works to you... Unfortunately, I didn't.
Araby: Oh, speaking of architecture, go to northern Sumeru City and see the Palace of Alcazarzaray if you're interested.
Araby: The Palace is the masterpiece of Mr. Kaveh, who graduated from Kshahrewar with honors. It's magnificent and exquisite.
Araby: It's said to be commissioned by a filthy rich merchant, but I have no clue who that is, so I've got nothing more to tell you.

## Talk

Traveler: About marine life...
Araby: They're mainly sea monsters. A group of mysterious creatures that live in the sea and occasionally attack residents of coastal areas.
Araby: With the progress of my research, I've been able to predict roughly when they would appear and issue warnings.
Araby: As soon as the warning is issued, all ships will return to the harbor to avoid disturbing those sea creatures.
Araby: There are exceptions too, of course. A few days ago, I saw a ship leave the harbor after the warning was issued. I don't know if it came back safely.
Araby: Maybe some researcher planned on observing the sea when the sea monsters are out and about. I feel sorry for the people on the ship.
