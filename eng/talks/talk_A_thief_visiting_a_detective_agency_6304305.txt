Traveler: A thief visiting a detective agency...?
Nishiguchi: Desperate times call for desperate measures. Maybe they'll help me.
Nishiguchi: Anyway, the people from Bantan Sango Detective Agency are far more competent than those useless pieces of garbage at the Police Station. You can ask them for help if you need anything.
Nishiguchi: I've heard that the president of the agency is very talented. She might be able to help me retrieve my wealth, haha...
Nishiguchi: But I don't think I have the money to pay for the commission. Ugh...
