Flora: Would you like to buy some flowers? I'm afraid you've come at a bad time...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Flora: A lot of the flowers in my shop were blown away by that huge wind from before.
Flora: Not only were the flowers on display outside blown away, but so were some that I had left near the storefront.
Flora: I still have a fair bit of stock, but the flowers put on display are the prettiest ones. A lot of customers are attracted by them.
Flora: Now, these flowers have been blown away, and I still need to clean up the store, so I won't be able to find time to pick new ones...
Flora: Traveler, if you're willing, could you help me pick some fresh flowers?

Traveler: Leave it to me.
Flora: Great! Still, you might need to pick quite a few...
Flora: Let me see... First, please help me pick one sweet flower and one small lamp grass from the Whispering Woods.
Flora: Then go to Windrise, and get me one windwheel aster.
Flora: Finally, help me pick a Cecilia from Starsnatch Cliff.
Flora: Please come back as soon as possible once you have them. If they wilt, they can't be displayed at the storefront.

Traveler: Sorry, I'm busy right now...

## Talk 3

Traveler: Why do you like dandelions so much?
Flora: Hehe, I wonder... Maybe it's because I've been reading The Fox in the Dandelion Sea.
Flora: Here, take it. Maybe you'll like dandelions too once you finish reading it, hehe.

## Talk 4

Flora: Welcome to Floral Whisper. Do you need anything?

Traveler: *We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.*
Flora: Is there a music event going on in the city? I'm only familiar with flowers, though, not music.
Paimon: Nah, this one's taking place in Inazuma. And it's totally fine if you don't know much about music, you just need to enjoy it! If there's a tune you like, we could play it for you right now, y'know?
Flora: Well... I do have something in mind. Its name escapes me, but I can hum the tune, at least. Will that do?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Flora: Nice, woohoo!

### Talk 4 related talk 1

Traveler: How was that?
Flora: Ooh, you're great! This is even better than when Mr. Sayid plays it! He performed this one for us last Windblume Festival, saying that it was a traditional song from Sumeru.
Flora: Donna said it sounded terrible compared to Master Diluc's playing, though.
Flora: Well, I've made up my mind. The flowers need care every day, and Inazuma's pretty far away, so I'm afraid I can't go.
Flora: Thanks for the music, though. It was lovely. On that note, I'll offer you a special price if you need flowers for your festival!

### Talk 4 related talk 2

Traveler: About those flowers...
Flora: Did you finish getting the flowers?
Traveler: Got 'em right here.
Flora: These are all so fresh... Thank you. With these flowers out at the storefront, we're sure to attract a lot of customers.
Flora: If I could make another small request... the wind also blew all the dandelions we had away.
Flora: Although dandelions being carried away by the wind isn't a bad thing...
Flora: But it still seem strange for a florist's in Mondstadt to not have dandelions.
Flora: Dandelions can't just be plucked and brought back â€” they have to be regrown from scratch.
Flora: So could you help fetch a batch of Dandelion Seeds for me?
Traveler: I'll do it.
Flora: I'm counting on you, then. I recall that there are lots of dandelions just outside Mondstadt.
Traveler: Where should I start looking?
Flora: There are lots of dandelions outside the city. You should be able to get them easily.

### Talk 4 related talk 3

Traveler: So, about those dandelions...
Flora: Have you managed to get the dandelions?
Traveler: I have them.
Flora: Thank you. This should be enough. I'll sow the seeds into these pots...
Flora: ...Along with those flowers that you found for me earlier.
Flora: Ah, yes. I have to thank you, don't I? This is a little token, please take it.
Flora: Now, I have to quickly put these flowers inside these pots here. Then the dandelions seeds go there...

### Talk 4 related talk 4

Traveler: About those flowers...
Flora: You can find small lamp grass and sweet flowers in the Whispering Woods. Windrise is where you'll find windwheel asters, and you can find cecilias on Starsnatch Cliff.
Flora: You can definitely get the freshest flowers from these areas.
Flora: Once you've finished picking them, please bring them back to me as quickly as possible.

### Talk 4 related talk 5

Traveler: So, about those dandelions...
Flora: Dandelions can be found just outside Mondstadt, but I have to clean up the shop, and simply don't have time to leave...
Flora: So please, help me gather a batch of Dandelion Seeds.

### Talk 4 related talk 6

Traveler: Do you sell any Mondstadt specialties?
Flora: Specialties? You're looking for a gift? Hmm, but I only sell flowers, which don't stay fresh for very long. They'll wilt very quickly.
Flora: The only other thing I can think of is to make a flower bookmark. I sometimes make them as gifts for my friends.
Flora: They aren't worth a lot in monetary terms, but maybe they have some sentimental value... If you're interested, I suppose I can make one for you.
Flora: But first, you must answer my question. Answer correctly, and I will make a bookmark for you.
Flora: It's a very easy question. Here goes: Is the Dandelion a flower?

### Talk 4 related talk 7

Traveler: I'm still confused by this whole Dandelion dilemma...
Flora: Dandelions are flowers! That's all there is to it! Any other questions?
Traveler: Why, Flora? Why are Dandelions flowers?
Flora: Gentle and floaty... They make you feel happy... Everyone loves them...
Flora: Ergo, Dandelions are flowers, of course!

### Talk 4 related talk 8

Traveler: About these Dandelion flowers...
Flora: Have you got the Dandelion Seeds?
Traveler: I have them here.
Flora: Yep, that's them! Great. And in return, here's your bookmark.
Flora: Flower bookmarks are very fragile, and very easily lost. I'll box it for you, just don't go opening it unless you have to.
Flora: It's a shame you can't make bookmarks out of Dandelion Seeds...

### Talk 4 related talk 9

Flora: What kind of flowers does Lisa like?
Flora: You want to know what flowers to get for Miss Lisa?
Flora: We're not particularly close, but she strikes me as a classy lady!
Flora: Hmm... Yep, it can only be the *Cecilia*!

### Talk 4 related talk 10

Traveler: I'd like to buy some flowers.
Flora: Certainly. We have a fine selection, whether you're looking to give a bouquet to someone or even do some gardening yourself.

### Talk 4 related talk 11

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Flora: I was honestly more frightened by the storm that surrounded Mondstadt than Stormterror.
Flora: Everyone's been focused on the losses to people and property, but I'm still more concerned about the plants and flowers.
Flora: I'll protect them, just like how Lord Barbatos protects us.

### Talk 4 related talk 12

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Flora: It's great that I don't have to worry about the flowers in my store being blown away by the wind.
Flora: That said, the Dandelion Seeds have also been blown all across the region of Mondstadt by this storm. Who knows, perhaps they will bloom throughout the land.
Flora: When I think about it like that, the storm doesn't seem so scary anymore, haha.

Traveler: Tell me about Dandelions.
Flora: Dandelions are so very feathery. They are my personal favorite.

### Talk 5 related talk 1

Traveler: Tell me about Sweet Flowers.
