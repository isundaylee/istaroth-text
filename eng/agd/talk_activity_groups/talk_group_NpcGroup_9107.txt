## Talk

Citlali: #Hello, Traveler. So, this is where you live?
Citlali: Is this... a good time for a visit? I only ask because, nine times out of ten, my place is unfit for guests...

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Citlali: Oh, it's nice.
Citlali: But, I don't think I could actually live here.
Citlali: This space is too big. If I'm reading on the bed and want a drink, I'd have to actually get up and walk...
Traveler: Oh, uh... That's a good point...
Citlali: I know.
Citlali: Wait, did you just agree with me because you think I'm old? Laziness is a habit I learned from young people, you know!
Citlali: Wait, scratch that. I AM young...
Traveler: You could just put a chair next to the bed to hold your snacks and drinks...
Citlali: Genius!
Citlali: Ahem, I mean... you know this place best, so it only makes sense that you would come up with a solution.
Citlali: In that case, I'm in favor of more space. Spacious rooms are more conducive to relaxation, anyway.

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Citlali: Sure. Is there something you want to talk about?
Traveler: What happened to those... creations of yours?
Citlali: You mean the Tzitzimimeh? Yeah, it's strange.
Citlali: This realm is quite special. It's almost completely isolated from the outside world, so the malice of the stars has been greatly reduced.
Citlali: That's probably why they look a bit out of sorts.
Traveler: I'm almost starting to feel bad for them...
Citlali: Oh, that's kind of you.
Citlali: They are born of the world's malice towards humans, but don't worry — their capacity for evil was stripped away before anything bad could happen.
Citlali: Now, they're nothing more than mascots.
Citlali: By the looks of it, there are illuminated creations here powerful enough to obscure the celestial mechanisms. This must be a mystical realm...
Traveler: How did you know?
Citlali: If you read light novels, it's obvious.
Citlali: The ancient vassals in "Mirage Warriors" were able to preserve many ancient technologies and mystical arts from the preceding Age of the Three Saints, including the ability to create realms.
Citlali: Wait, maybe it was a true story all along!
Traveler: I don't think so...
Citlali: W—Well, in any case, all the best novels take inspiration from real life.
Citlali: Actually... What are the chances Mirage Warriors was written by one of your adepti friends?
Citlali: And the feline-headed "Higashi no Sankun" and "Nishi no Oubo" are just self-inserts?
Traveler: Um... Now that you say that...
Citlali: Wait, does that mean you actually know some kind of cat adeptus?
Citlali: Huh, now that I think about it... I don't think the author was an adeptus.
Citlali: I've been following that novel since the beginning, and the writing has changed hands twice already. That wouldn't happen with an adeptus. They can outlast pretty much anyone...
Traveler: I suppose things are safer this way.
Citlali: You're not wrong. They are born of the world's malice towards humans, after all.
Citlali: But don't worry, they're harmless now. Under my control, they can't do anything bad.

## Talk

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Citlali: Huh, doing nothing at all sounds pretty nice.
Traveler: You've got a point.
Citlali: Most people live no longer than a hundred years, so there's no point losing sleep over issues that will take thousands of years to solve.
Citlali: But, live long enough, and you learn that only a handful of things in life truly matter.
Citlali: You can dedicate one tenth of your time to the important things, but when it comes to the remaining nine tenths, it's just a matter of finding ways to pass the time.
Citlali: But, that's just a general rule, okay? Not a comment on my age!
Traveler: Huh, I don't feel like I have that much down time.
Citlali: Hm, I guess you're right. Maybe my life is just less interesting.
Citlali: It's just like the detectives from those Fontaine crime novels — always embroiled in intrigue wherever they go.
Citlali: I suppose there are people like that in real life, too.
Traveler: In real life, we call those people, "unlucky."
Citlali: Actually, crime novels only chronicle a small part of a detective's life.
Citlali: Realistically, the cases only last a few days.
Citlali: So, who knows? Maybe they're just killing time in between important events like the rest of us.
Traveler: Or maybe the rest of their time is spent trying to recover from mental trauma...
Citlali: Well, when you put it that way... Choosing to do nothing is how I recover from the trauma in my life.
Citlali: ...
Citlali: Okay, I'm begging you... Don't give me that look. I can hear what you're thinking.
Citlali: "Citlali's nihilism strikes again."
Citlali: But, I'm fine! At my age, I don't need people fretting over me... Not that I'm THAT old, of course...
Citlali: Anyway, it doesn't matter... C'mon, let's go for a walk. We should grab something to eat, too. It's been a while.
Citlali: Well? What are you waiting for? Let's get a move on!

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Citlali.
Citlali: Morning! If I hadn't stayed up all night, I never would have known you get up this early.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Citlali.
Citlali: Good night. I'm going to keep walking around. I'm not used to a night sky without stars...

## Talk

Citlali: I love this kind of place. Even looking at it just makes me feel so peaceful.
Citlali: It's quiet and far away from the crowds, just like my place. Quite a bit tidier, though...
Citlali: But don't worry — as long as no deliveries make it out this way, I won't mess the place up!

## Talk

Citlali: You really didn't need to go to all this effort, you know. I don't exactly get homesick. But if you're interested, there are some mysterious traditions behind these items that I can share with you.
Citlali: For instance, some things shouldn't be put in boys' bedrooms, and others shouldn't be put in girls' bedrooms...
Citlali: Not that you need to worry about all that. Your fate is ironclad, plus you have powerful allies. That's enough to scare away any evil entities.
