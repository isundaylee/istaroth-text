# Legend of the Darknight Hero


## Talk 1

Charles: So you've got a taste for adventure too, huh?
Charles: I must say, the patrons have been in a bit of a buzz lately.
Charles: Though the topic on everyone's lips is more of an urban legend than actual news.
Charles: Even minding my own business I still end up hearing all about it.
Paimon: Uh-oh... It's not one of those scary urban legends, is it?
Paimon: If so, Paimon needs to take a deep breath first!
Charles: Hahaha, it's not a particularly scary story, no... At least, not for most people...
Charles: It's the tale of... the Darknight Hero!
Paimon: Argh!!!
Traveler: Paimon, he literally just said it's NOT a scary story.
Paimon: Huh? Did the bartender just say something?
Charles: You weren't even listening?
Charles: Anyway, the Darknight Hero.
Charles: It is said that he appears in the middle of the night to fight evil and uphold justice.
Charles: But to be honest, I don't have much interest in such rumors.
Charles: Unless of course he can help take care of the more belligerent patrons after they've had a few too many...
Charles: I would happily take that as proof of his existence.
Traveler: Has anyone ever seen him?
Charles: I'm told that there have been a handful of sightings. But in the depths of night, no one can get a good look at him.
Charles: Perhaps that's why he only appears at night.
Charles: Nevertheless, the sightings confirm that the Darknight Hero is more than just a groundless rumor.
Charles: Any guy in the tavern could tell you that.
Charles: Hehe, anyway... That's more or less everything I know.
Charles: If you want to know more, ask around in the plaza. Ah, I need to serve some customers.
Paimon: "Darknight Hero"... seems like your standard cookie-cutter urban legend.
Paimon: But just a little darker.
Paimon: Wonder who it could be. Once you're ready, let's head out to the *plaza* and ask around!
Traveler: Why would he hide his identity?
Charles: I doubt anyone knows but him.
Charles: Maybe he enjoys being a man of mystery.
Charles: After all, it's a good way to get the ladies' attention.
Traveler: Argh!
Charles: Hey. Look, do you want to hear the story or not?
Paimon: Wha— What did the bartender just say?

## Talk 2

Margaret: You want to find out about the Darknight Hero?
Margaret: Look no further. It's me! I am the Darknight Hero.
Traveler: You're kidding, right?
Margaret: *giggle* You're right, I'm not. I was joking.
Traveler: Huh...
Paimon: Heh...
Margaret: Heh. Jokes aside, I do think that the Darknight Hero and I have one thing in common.
Paimon: What's that?
Margaret: It's... the way he sticks to his principles... coming out here night after night, fighting for justice, keeping Mondstadt safe...
Paimon: Wow, so you're a nocturnal vigilante too?
Margaret: N—No, I just mean, he must be seriously rich.
Paimon: Why is that?
Margaret: People only start worrying about spiritual fulfillment once they have enough material wealth.
Margaret: It's the same in every hero story, isn't it?
Traveler: So... you just wanted to flaunt your wealth.
Margaret: Heh. No, it's nothing like that. I just have too much time on my hands these days.
Paimon: Same difference, you are the boss of the Cat's Tail after all...
Margaret: Why don't you ask the guards at the *city gate*?
Margaret: They do night shifts all the time, they must know something.
Traveler: Just as I thought — it was you all along!
Margaret: ...I'm joking. Don't take everything so seriously.

## Talk 3

Lawrence: You want to know about... him?
Lawrence: In fact, I'm one of the few who has seen him with my own two eyes.
Paimon: Great! This is the guy we need to talk to.
Paimon: So... just who is the Darknight Hero?
Lawrence: Whoa— S—Slow down, let me start from the beginning.
Lawrence: Well, I was patrolling one night, when suddenly I heard something. I rushed over to check it out.
Lawrence: I saw a gang of suspicious-looking fellows who looked like they were up to no good.
Lawrence: So I quickly hid.
Paimon: Hid? You're supposed to be a guard!
Lawrence: That was when... he appeared.
Lawrence: He was dressed in black from head to toe, perfectly hidden in the night.
Lawrence: The way he crept up on those bad guys, it must have felt like a living nightmare.
Paimon: Wow...
Lawrence: Guess what I did next?
Traveler: Ran away?
Lawrence: I wasn't the bad guy! Why would I need to run away?
Lawrence: ...Still, I did leave the scene. I didn't want to be a nuisance to the Darknight Hero.
Lawrence: ...So instead, I headed to the Knights of Favonius' residence.
Traveler: You think the Darknight Hero might be one of the Knights?
Lawrence: Correct. I thought, "Surely someone with such a strong sense of justice and who voluntarily protects Mondstadt is exactly the kind of person you'd find in the Knights of Favonius."
Lawrence: *sigh* But it seems I was wrong.
Lawrence: I checked everywhere, and there were no signs of anyone having left the building.
Paimon: So you're saying whoever it is can't be from the Knights of Favonius after all?
Lawrence: Yes. But I just can't understand... Why would someone like that not want to join the Knights?
Lawrence: I'm sure they would warmly welcome someone of his abilities.
Paimon: So the point you're trying to make is... You don't know who the Darknight Hero is either?
Lawrence: Hey, don't be like that! At least by talking to me you've ruled out a few more people...
Lawrence: Anyway, try asking at the *Flower Shop*. I heard a girl there's been talking about the time he rescued her.
Traveler: Became his sidekick?
Lawrence: Heh... I would probably have just gotten in the way as far as the Darknight Hero is concerned.

## Talk 4

Donna: What's wrong with me...
Donna: Why can't I get him out of my mind...
Paimon: Ah, hello? We'd like to ask you about the Darknight Hero—
Donna: MY HERO! ...Oh, sorry! Just hearing his name gets me lost in thought... Hang on, how did you know who I was talking about?
Donna: Is it that obvious?
Donna: Oh no, what am I going to do...? If Master Diluc ever finds out—
Paimon: Huh? What's Diluc got to do with this?
Donna: Ugh... Well, I guess I might as well spill the beans then.
Donna: I used to think Diluc was the one for me.
Donna: But ever since the time I was rescued by the Darknight Hero... I—I just don't know anymore...
Paimon: Wowee, you saw the Darknight Hero? For real? What's he like?
Donna: It all happened so fast... I was so scared...
Donna: All I remember is seeing a flash of fire... but I felt safe. I only saw his silhouette but it felt so... familiar.
Traveler: A flash of fire... a Vision, perhaps?
Donna: Who knows? Now that you mention it, a Pyro Vision does seem like a good explanation.
Donna: It lit up the whole area in an instant. I remember that very well.
Paimon: Oookay then! Well, thanks for the intel Donna. See you around!
Paimon: So, based on what we know so far...
Paimon: All we need to do is find a wealthy, Vision-wielding vigilante who is not one of the Knights.
Paimon: Hmm... Nope, still no idea.
Paimon: But we already asked so many people. Guess we got to see for ourselves.
Paimon: Let's take a look around the city at nighttime — if we're lucky, we just might bump into him.
Traveler: Familiar? Could it be someone you know?
Donna: Hmm... That I really do not know.
Donna: Perhaps it was... fate?
Donna: You know? When you meet someone and it feels like... like you've known them your whole life?

## Talk 5

Diluc: After managing to steer clear of the guards' patrol route... I never anticipated I'd run into you instead.
Traveler: The Darknight Hero! I knew it was you all along!
Diluc: "Darknight Hero..."? Sounds awfully derivative to me. Please tell me you didn't come up with that.
Paimon: How is this the first you've heard of the name? Every man and his dog in Mondstadt is yapping about the Darknight Hero!
Diluc: I do not concern myself with idle chatter... Though, I suppose I may take the idleness of others as a sign that peace prevails.
Paimon: Huzzah! The Great Mystery of the Darknight Hero of Mondstadt... We solved it!
Paimon: Now then, Mr. Darknight Hero—
Diluc: Please, stop calling me that. Seriously, it makes me uncomfortable.
Paimon: Hah, not surprised. It's the stupidest superhero name Paimon's ever heard. You should come up with something more original.
Paimon: Like...
Paimon: Emm... "Captain Pie..."
Diluc: Pie?
Traveler: Pie?
Paimon: Captain Pyro!
Paimon: Tell us Captain Pyro, what happened here today?
Diluc: ...
Diluc: It was the Abyss Order.
Paimon: Them again?
Diluc: I don't know what the devil they're plotting this time. It seems they're performing some initial reconnaissance.
Diluc: Considering that I've proven myself to be one step ahead of them on countless occasions, their persistence is... unusual.
Traveler: Have you been dealing with them alone the whole time?
Diluc: I assume so, unless you're aware of any other "Darknight Heroes" around these parts.
Diluc: The Knights are, for the most part, an utterly incompetent bunch.
Diluc: I cannot trust them to take this matter over.
Traveler: So this is a job for the mighty Diluc then.
Diluc: *sigh* That's not my point. I am not doing this to impress anyone.
Diluc: Well, I hope this conversation has been of service to you — because I would like to ask for a favor in return.
Paimon: Ooh, what is it Master Diluc? Your wish is our command~
Diluc: You must keep my identity a secret.
Diluc: Above all, it is crucial that you *do not let the Knights of Favonius know I am connected to any of this*.
Diluc (???): *footsteps*
Paimon: What's that sound? Yikes, have the Abyss Order sent backup already?
Diluc: They appear to just be small-timers. You should have no trouble dealing with them.
Diluc: I cannot afford delays on account of a few lackeys. I shall have to let you take care of them.
Diluc: Remember — don't tell a soul!
Paimon: Hey! You're just gonna leave us like this!?
Traveler: It seems you have history with the Knights.
Diluc: What's past is past. I would prefer not to discuss it.
Traveler: Why don't you get the Knights of Favonius to help?
Diluc: Hmph. Who would be helping whom is debatable.
Traveler: Diluc!? YOU are the Darknight Hero?
