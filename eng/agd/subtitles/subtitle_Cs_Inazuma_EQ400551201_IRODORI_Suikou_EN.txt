One Year
The poet Suikou made his way to Tenshukaku
And presented the Kasen's work for the Shogun's perusal
But a page from the works of Aoi no Okina had been torn out
And Suikou was questioned regarding the matter
Suikou pleaded guilty
He admitted to drinking at the tavern the night before
And vaguely recalled a mysterious figure approaching while he was intoxicated
