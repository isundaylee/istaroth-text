# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to raise one?
Chanil: Yes, I do! I really want to, even in my dreams!
Chanil: But Mom and Dad keep telling me that I'm still too young, and that I'll have to earn some kind of special name before I can bring a Saurian home...
Chanil: Why? I really don't get it. Don't I already have a name of my own? Is it because the Saurians can't understand the way we talk, so we've got to use their language instead?
Chanil: *sigh* When will I finally be considered a grown-up? I just want to be able to cuddle with my Saurian as I eat and fall asleep...
