Traveler: About Stormterror...
Reckless Pallad: Never mind the dragon... Say, do you think that the ruins in Stormterror's Lair might contain some great treasure?
Reckless Pallad: Who knows? If I could nick a few priceless articles from within, I might not have to worry about money for the rest of my life, hehe...
Reckless Pallad: ...Or so I say, but I haven't the guts to go in there, even though the dragon's gone now...

Traveler: But aren't you resting right now?
Reckless Pallad: Resting is a necessary stage in the treasure hunting process. If I'm not well-fed and well-rested, the treasure will find a way to evade me.
Reckless Pallad: So right now, I am busy resting.
