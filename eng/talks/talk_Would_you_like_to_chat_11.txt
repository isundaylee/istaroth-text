# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to chat?
Wriothesley: Sure. Got anything on your mind?
Wriothesley: Talking about the weather is usually a great way to get a conversation going, but it seems like the weather here is always the same.
Traveler: That's the work of Tubby, the teapot spirit.
Wriothesley: I see, so the keeper of this place is a teapot spirit...
Wriothesley: When I first arrived, I had actually mistaken her for one of those large finchbill pets.
Traveler: Don't judge a book by its cover.
Wriothesley: Yeah, you're right.
Wriothesley: Speaking of which, I actually made a similar mistake when I was young. I once thought that Melusines were the form that sea hares took when they hopped onto land.
Wriothesley: It wasn't until I read some books that I realized just how silly I was.
Wriothesley: You should know that according to laws and regulations, Melusines are also recognized citizens of Fontaine. It is forbidden to view or treat them as pets or monsters.
Traveler: I figured it was something like that.
Wriothesley: Good, that makes for one less legal trouble you may get yourself into.
Wriothesley: Although it'd be great to have more people working in the Fortress, I've never been interested in instigating crime.
Wriothesley: It is my hope that people will use more legitimate channels to find work in the Fortress of Meropide. There's no need to cause headaches for the upstanding ladies and gentlemen of the Palais Mermonia.
Traveler: First time I've ever heard of it...
Wriothesley: I believe you owe me a big thank-you, then.
Wriothesley: Criminals that disrespect Melusines usually get slapped with a pretty hefty sentence.
