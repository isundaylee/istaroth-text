Traveler: It was your research that caused this tragedy.
Edwin Eastinghouse: Indeed, it was a tragedy. However, they sacrificed themselves for science, and I salute them.
Edwin Eastinghouse: But I must insist that you stop trying to pin that explosion on me. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I wasn't in the Central Laboratory at the time. I was out inspecting other departments.
Edwin Eastinghouse: Some knucklehead must have spilled a cup of coffee, or accidentally pulled the wrong lever. Who knows how those idiots screwed up? At any rate, they ruined my lab and the entire Arkhium project!
