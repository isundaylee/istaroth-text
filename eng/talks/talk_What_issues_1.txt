Traveler: What issues?
Babisse: I'm designing a high-speed aquabus, but there's just one problem...
Babisse: After a period of high-speed operation, its internal components begin to vibrate intensely, damaging them...
Babisse: I've tried switching materials many times, but the problem remains. Is the problem with my design, then, or the materials?
