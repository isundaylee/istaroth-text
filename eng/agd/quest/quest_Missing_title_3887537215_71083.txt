## Talk 1

Muning: What? You seriously broke the Seven-Star Array? Ugh, looks like I'll have to write this into the weekly report...
Traveler: Make sure you make it sound cool, alright?
Muning: *cough* Please, this is a very serious situation. It's so serious, in fact, that the Qixing themselves will decide its exact seriousness.
Muning: Which is to say that once report gets sent up, someone from the Qixing might personally come down here to stop you.
Muning: Even I won't be able to save you then.
Traveler: (This guy is way too obvious with his hints...)
Muning: Scared, huh? Alright, move along, then! There's still someone waiting for you, you know?

## Talk 2

Muning: How is everything down there? Did you encounter any danger?
Traveler: (You describe your experiences to Muning.)
Muning: Ah, I see. That does sound rather dangerous. I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to help take care of Jinwu and Zhiqiong, then.
Traveler: Aren't you supposed to stop me?
Muning: Well, that is my duty, yes. But you always run off too quickly for me to stop you, so I can't.
Traveler: I don't run that fast.
Muning: No, you do. That's what the report says, and what the report says is the truth.
Traveler: Alright, guess I'm really, really fast, then.
Muning: Exactly. As such, please do be careful.
Traveler: All goes well, don't you fret.
Muning: That's good, that's good. As long as things go well, the Qixing will have no reason to come down too hard on me...
