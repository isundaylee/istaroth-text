Traveler: Grade seven pawn?
Hanquan: Martial artists are divided into nine grades. One's the highest, nine the lowest.
Hanquan: Now, I was escorting someone from Yanshang Teahouse to Qiaoying Village two days ago, when I ran into this... mouthy pest!
Hanquan: I couldn't stop myself from exchanging a few pointers with him, but what do you know, he was just a worthless grade seven.
Hanquan: In the end, the strong keep it on the down low. I don't know why those clowns are so fond of acting out.
