Traveler: Good night, Kinich.
Kinich: Alright. Forget your worries and sleep well. Good night.
Ajaw: Haha, imagine needing nightly sleep and being scared of the dark! You poor, wretched mortals with your pathetic, frail bodies... We pity you.
Kinich: If you're above needing sleep, O supreme ruler, I guess you won't be needing any food either?
Ajaw: How dare you threaten me, servant! I will haunt your nightmares!
