Traveler: Keeping a piece?
Arachatora: #Cooking all the "Head Mushroom" for Nara Traveler, that was the plan. But sister said, no mushroom picking before the Sunsettia ripens another ten times.
Arachatora: Without the scent of mushrooms, Arachatora feels bad. Arachatora might sneak out for mushrooms when the Sunsettia ripens only nine times.
Arachatora: So Arachatora kept a tiny little piece, thinner than the leaves. It will stay with Arachatora.
Arachatora: So embarrassing...
