# Scenes from Life in Meropide: Every Debt has a Creditor


## Talk 1

Galvaryet: I said, either find a way to remove it or figure out who's behind it.
Maupoil: Easy for you to say... I've tried all kinds of cleaners, and none of 'em worked. If it needs something stronger... We have to try Hydro Phantasm Taint-B-Gone.
Galvaryet: Hydro Phantasm Taint-B-Gone? Are you trying to burn a hole through the wall!? We'll all be sleeping with the fishes in no time!
Maupoil: Then we'll have to locate the culprit. But we don't have any clues regarding their identity.
Paimon: What's wrong? Is there anything we can do for you?
Maupoil: Well... See that mark on the wall? Graffiti is prohibited in the Fortress of Meropide...
Maupoil: We've tried everything, but we still can't remove it, so if we could at least locate the culprit...
Galvaryet: Wait, hold on, now that I think about it, we aren't completely without leads. I remember Clynes mentioning that the Fontaine Research Institute has a mark that requires a special method to decipher.
Maupoil: Are you trying to say that it's the same type of mark?
Galvaryet: I wasn't interested in the slightest back then, so I didn't bother asking for more information. Maybe he could give us an answer if he was here.
Traveler: Maybe he's the culprit.
Galvaryet: Indeed, we cannot rule out that possibility. But if that's the case, hehe... He should know the rules.
Galvaryet: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, you're knowledgeable adventurers with a wealth of experience, so do you have any ideas?
Galvaryet: Help us locate the culprit behind the graffiti, or bring Clynes here to have a look. Hmm... Consider it an official commission then — with Coupons as compensation.
Paimon: Alright. If it's an official commission, then we'll give it a go.
Galvaryet: Thank you. In the meantime, I'll try to find other means of removing it.
Traveler: Then shall we go get him?
Maupoil: I have no idea where he is, though... Haven't seen him all day. And are we really going to ask for his help? I lose a little bit of self-respect every time I ask him for something.

## Talk 2

Maupoil: Would capturing a Blubberbeast and making it spit on the mark work?
Galvaryet: Are you serious? Have you been under too much stress lately? Are you still mentally sound? Have you been scheduled for too many shifts?
Maupoil: I'm absolutely fine. I just want to see a Blubberbeast spit.
Galvaryet: You... need to take a day off.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Huh? Isn't that Clynes?
Traveler: Hello, Clynes. We meet again.
Paimon: Huh? If Clynes is here, then that mark must've been his doing, then.
Clynes: Huh? What are you two doing here...?
Clynes: What are you talking about? I'm lost. Why don't you ask someone else?
Traveler: I think we've got the wrong guy, Paimon.
Paimon: #Oh, we got the wrong guy, did we... Wait! Don't let him deceive you, {NICKNAME}! There's no one else here, so it must be him!
Clynes: ...Alright, you win. I did it.
Clynes: *sigh* I was planning to use this to catch up with some acquaintances, but I didn't expect that the two of you would be the ones to show up.
Paimon: Catch up with some acquaintances?
Clynes: The Cipher Letter is a technology developed by Mr. Butor, and few know how to decode it, even at the Fontaine Research Institute. The only reason I know of it at all is because he was my benefactor.
Clynes: Unfortunately, he left us far too young, and management doesn't care for his Cipher Letter. So, I figured that if someone out there could decipher it, then we would have something to talk about.
Clynes: Oh, I don't mean that there's nothing to say between us, but there are many topics we do not have in common.
Traveler: No need to force yourself, there really is nothing to say.
Clynes: You're... very honest. I once had a friend who was as frank as you. They got into quite a bit of trouble because of it...
Clynes: But looking back at it now, those really were happy times.
Clynes: Anyway, is that the only reason you're here?
Paimon: Paimon almost forgot! Galvaryet and Maupoil asked us to investigate the culprit behind the graffiti.
Traveler: Turn yourself in, please.
Paimon: Turn yourself in! We won't show you any mercy if you resist arrest!
Clynes: *sigh*... Can't we just talk about this? Forget about Maupoil, I just don't want to fall into Galvaryet's clutches.
Clynes: Would it be possible for you to, y'know, just turn a blind eye to this whole thing?
Paimon: But Maupoil said graffiti is prohibited in the Fortress! And breaking the rules is bad, isn't it?
Clynes: If you're feeling a bit generous with definitions, then the Cipher Letters on the wall are no different from anything else posted there. They're decorations, nothing more.
Clynes: #How about I go with you, but {NICKNAME} can decide whether or not to turn me in?
Clynes: Of course, if you choose to help me and save me from Galvaryet's clutches... I'd be willing to compensate you accordingly.
Clynes: I'm putting my fate in your hands. Let's head out now.
Traveler: I'm so sorry about that.
Clynes: Hah! When you say something like that, just how do you expect me to reply?
Clynes: I know that at times like this, I should be polite and say something like "it might be nice to hear about your adventures." But...
Clynes: I've decided to be honest with myself — with this, anyway. I don't want to hear novel stories about the outside world. All I want to do is catch up with someone. So, I should be the one to apologize.
Traveler: Have a look around. See anyone else here besides you?
Paimon: Yeah, that's right! Stop trying to trick us with your lousy acting!
Traveler: 'Fess up! You did it, right?
Paimon: 'Fess up! You're the one behind the graffiti, right?

## Talk 4

Galvaryet: I see you've found Clynes. But... Have you found the person responsible for the graffiti? Or at least any clues?
Paimon: Well, about that...
Traveler: It was Clynes.
Galvaryet: I thought so too.
Clynes: Ugh, and just like that, all the excuses I came up with are useless. I guess I'm just meat on the chopping block now, waiting to see how you'll dispose of me, huh?
Paimon: Rules are rules.
Maupoil: To be honest, I'm more concerned about how to remove this mark than any punishment you'll receive.
Clynes: You're interested in Cipher Letter technology? It will take quite a bit of time to explain, so why don't you sit down and listen?
Maupoil: No, I'm not interested in the specifics. Just tell me how to remove it...
Clynes: Even that's a long story. After all, special paint and techniques are utilized...
Maupoil: I have other work to attend to, so keep it short. Uh... Please...
Galvaryet: #Let's leave them to it. {NICKNAME} and Paimon, here's the compensation you were promised. Thank you for your help.
Traveler: This requires a professional. Clynes, have a look.
Galvaryet: Clynes, is this the special mark you mentioned before?
Clynes: Let me see... Hmm... Oh... Doesn't it look a lot like a gear? Where else could such a huge gear come from, except the Fontaine Research Institute?
Galvaryet: It's from the Institute... and so are you. I'd say the link between the two is pretty obvious. Just admit it. You're the culprit, aren't you?
Clynes: You can't say it like that! If, one day, I should be fortunate enough to dine with Galvana at Hotel Debord...
Galvaryet: If you're still in dreamland, I can help you wake up. And if you think my punches aren't strong enough, I'm sure Roussimoff would be willing to lend a hand or three.
Clynes: Calm down, I'm only giving you an example! It's just an example!
Clynes: Where was I... *ahem* Anyway, if Galvana and I were to go out together, though we're both from the Fortress, that doesn't mean that there is any connection between us.
Clynes: See? There's no connection whatsoever! There's no link between me and this mark, just like there's no link between me and Galvana.
Galvaryet: Fine, you've convinced me. But only about the relationship between you and Sis.
Traveler: Doesn't that mean he hasn't convinced you at all?
Paimon: W—Well, we've got nothing else to say about this. It's up to you guys now!
Clynes: Well, no matter what, I owe you my thanks. And the compensation you were promised...
Maupoil: #Right! {NICKNAME} and Paimon! I almost forgot your compensation! Although it's a pity you couldn't locate the culprit...
Maupoil: But I'm sure Clynes will have a way to remove the mark! I'll leave the rest to him and Galvaryet, then. In the meantime, I have other work to attend to.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Maupoil: As I said, I have other work to attend to...
Clynes: Everything has its own proper sequence. You must first understand the principles behind...
Galvaryet: What a pain. Sis and I are having dinner together today, so I'm leaving when my shift is over... whether or not this mess has been cleaned up.
