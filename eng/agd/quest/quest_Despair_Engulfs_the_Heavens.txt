# Despair Engulfs the Heavens


## Talk 1

Paimon: Yet another place crawling with monsters...
Paimon: Let's clear the area and see if there are any survivors.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Monsters everywhere you look, and... Oh no, looks like there's a saurian corpse...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Doesn't look like we'll be able to find anyone here... The monsters are all that's left.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Over here, come on! Quick!
Paimon: Hey, wake up! And you, wake up!
Haronga: They're all dead.
Paimon: Oh no... were we too late?
Haronga: We were on our way to the stadium with our saurians, when that dark entity emerged in the sky. Seconds later, the Abyss monsters appeared and changed into saurian form.
Haronga: They fought till the end to protect us... and now...
Traveler: You should keep moving. This is no place to hang around.
Paimon: Right, you need to get to the stadium. C'mon, we'll take you.
Haronga: I guess... Thank you.
Haronga: I'm so sorry, truly I am... May the Wayob watch over your souls, now and forever...
Paimon: ...
Traveler: Paimon.
Paimon: Huh?
Traveler: This is no "disaster"...
Traveler: This is war.
Paimon: Y—Yeah... Paimon knows, it's just... it hasn't fully sunk in yet...
Paimon: But anyway, right now, let's focus on getting them to the Stadium.
Paimon: With any luck, there'll be an update waiting for us there. If not... we'll just have to play things by ear.

## Talk 5

Andinet: Thanks for your help. We'll manage for now, please go help the other affected areas.
Tewodros: Nowhere's safe from the Abyss monsters now, but at least they're still scared off by the Sacred Flame. We'll stay here and protect any refugees who have come here to seek sanctuary.

## Talk 6

Paimon: These warriors are struggling! Quick, let's help them!

## Talk 7

Paimon: Oh, thank goodness! Those people are still standing!

## Talk 8

Paimon: Nope... Nobody here...
Paimon: The latest intel said the Children of Echoes need support too. Let's head over.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Wait, over there! It's Chasca and Chuychu...
Chasca: #Traveler!? Over here, hurry!

## Talk 10

Maztla: These monsters — they're what the winners of the Pilgrimage go on to fight, aren't they?
Maztla: So that makes us veterans of the Night Warden Wars now, too.
Nellan: I hadn't thought of it like that, but now that you mention it... Yeah. You're right.
Nellan: Neither of us are name bearers, so in principle, we should never have had the chance to fight on the front lines. In that sense, this is... kind of a dream come true for us, isn't it?
Nellan: We're not in this for fame, or glory, but for our childhood dreams of one day becoming a hero.

## Talk 11

Paimon: There are too many monsters... There are just too many, it's beyond anything we've seen before...

## Talk 12

Paimon: ...!

## Talk 13

Tochlan: There you go, buddy. It's still gonna hurt for a few days, but apart from that, you're on the up and up.
Paimon: ...Toto? Toto, is that you?
Toto: Roar, roar ♪
Paimon: It IS you! Oh, thank goodness you're okay!
Tochlan: Toto was the only member of his family who didn't flee from the invasion. I don't know if he was being territorial or what, but he stayed and fought the Abyss...
Tochlan: If you hadn't gotten here when you did, he may not have made it.
Tochlan: We should let him rest here until he's able to stand again. I'll look after him.
Paimon: Thank you so much! Toto, next time you're told to evacuate, be a good saurian and do as you're told, okay? Otherwise, Kachina will be worried sick about you.
Toto: Roar...

## Talk 14

Chimalli: Thank you so much, you saved the day. The enemy attacks grow stronger with each wave... We're nearly at breaking point.
Chimalli: Given how few of us are left, I think it's time we cut our losses. This base is as good as gone.
Paimon: Yeah. Everyone needs to stick together. Best to regroup somewhere else.
Chimalli: ...Better late than never. Time to evacuate. Warriors, gather 'round!
Chimalli: For anyone who still wants to fight on the frontlines, the Children of Echoes' front is the closest to here. Anyone who wants to leave will likely also see action as they evacuate, but will be afforded safety at the Stadium.
Chimalli: Those are the options. We're abandoning this base, and you're free to stay with the group or leave.
Chimalli: With our limited numbers, I can't promise that we'll be of any real assistance to the Children of Echoes' war effort, even if we do join them. Please bear this in mind as you make your decision.
Chimalli: Now then. Anyone who wishes to keep fighting, show me how serious you are.
Chimalli: ...Really? Even after my less-than-rousing speech?
Yaretzi: Why would we give up now, after everything we've been through? We didn't stick it out this far just to admit defeat.
Acama: We can't give another inch to the Abyss. We have to fight them back — if not for our own sake, then at least for our fallen brethren.
Chimalli: Very well...
Chimalli: ..."For Natlan."
Yaretzi: ..."For Natlan."
Chimalli: We may be few in number, but our will remains strong. We will join the ranks of the Children of Echoes and they will be stronger for it, however little.
Paimon: Okay... Well, take care of yourselves.
Chimalli: Don't worry, it'll be just like another Night Warden War. We'll force the Abyss back if it's the last thing we do.
Traveler: What's that?
Paimon: Huh?
Paimon: Shoot, that creepy Abyss thing is raining down a dangerous-looking substance again!
Chimalli: ...That's over towards People of the Springs territory. From what I've heard, their defenses have been substantially weakened by the Abyss invasion.
Paimon: Then let's head over and check on them!

## Talk 15

Komina: May the Wayob grant you peace, and may songs be sung of your life's journey.
Komina: We give thanks for the gift of your life in ours. And we look forward to meeting you again one day, in a world of wonder and beauty.

## Talk 16

Paimon: There's just one battle report left, and it gives a long list of places where the "dangerous substance" has been dropping.
Paimon: *sigh* This is the first report we've had in ages, which means the messengers' job has become all but impossible...
Paimon: But there's nothing we can do about that. Our priority is to get to the next affected zone.
Paimon: Even if we don't find any survivors, maybe... maybe that strange substance over there won't be as rock-solid as here? There's a chance, at least?

## Talk 17

Paimon: Move out! You've gotta get out of here!
Paimon: Still no luck, huh. What on earth are these things? How are they invulnerable to attack?
Maztla: Yeah, at least with regular Abyssal Pylons, anyone with a Vision can destroy them. But this thing? No one's seen anything like it before.
Maztla: It's like... a part of that sky-demon's body, or something...
Maztla: Whatever it is, it seems like it can spawn Abyssal Pylons — and with them, a never-ending stream of Abyss monsters. We're just no match for it.
Nellan: At this point, retreat looks like our best option. We're fighting a losing battle here.
Nellan: The Stadium is our only hope. That's where the sacred flame is, which seems to be the one thing that well of Abyssal energy is afraid of.
Nellan: The Pyro Archon is guarding the flame. As long as that continues, we still have hope.
Paimon: Hmm? What's this?
Maztla: Water, and some snacks — you look like you need it. I'm guessing you've been supporting the fight all over the map? Sounds like you need a breather.
Maztla: We've got enough people to hold our own here, and it's high time you took a break. Why don't you sit down and gather your strength for a minute?
Paimon: #It's true, we've been fighting pretty much non-stop. Traveler, you must be exhausted, what do you think?
Traveler: Right now, there are bigger things to worry about.
Paimon: What is it?
Traveler: As long as that dark monstrosity remains unbeaten...
Paimon: Oh, you're right. Well then, guess we'd better go warn them...
Paimon: Um... It's your decision, if you wanna set off right away, Paimon will come with you!
Traveler: Gathering together might actually put a target on the Children of Echoes' back.

## Talk 18

Xilonen: Ah, it's you guys. Things are bad here — something fell out the sky that's impervious to our attacks.
Traveler: Not just here. We've run into a few of these already.
Kachina: Pacal gave the order for everyone to evacuate. Xilonen and I stayed behind as the rearguard.
Paimon: It's a good thing you did... otherwise, we might not have made it in time.
Xilonen: #Kachina, he and I can deal with the remaining monsters and Abyssal Pylons. You should go catch up with the rest of the group before your parents start worrying about you.
Kachina: Got it. I'll leave right away — they need all the help they can get.
Paimon: Stay safe, Kachina!
Xilonen: Come on. Let's get this done.

## Talk 19

Xilonen: Yep, that's everyone, and no more casualties by the looks of things... This is good. We can evacuate shortly.
Xilonen: I appreciate your help. How are things out there? Pretty dire, I bet.
Traveler: Extremely dire.
Xilonen: Some of the things I've seen, I don't know if I'll ever be able to get them out of my mind... Are we in Natlan doomed to this fate?
Xilonen: I've never witnessed a full-scale Abyss invasion before. I mean, I'd heard stories about the sky being painted black, but I always thought that was an exaggeration.
Xilonen: Mavuika has witnessed this all before, so she knew better than anyone the terror and despair an Abyss invasion would bring.
Paimon: Yeah... and despite that, she's still facing it head on...
Xilonen: We've had to abandon our homes and chase the dying light of day. Maybe the only time we'll see the dawn again is in our dreams.
Xilonen: But as long as there's even a sliver of hope, I'm not gonna give up.
Traveler: Me neither.
Xilonen: We should catch up with the group. Let's go.

## Talk 20

Chuychu: Ugh... Aaargh...
Paimon: Wh—What happened to her? She's covered in Abyssal energy!
Traveler: I'll help her.
Chasca: Please... save her...
Chasca: How's that, Chuychu? Any better now?
Paimon: Chuychu? Chuychu!
Chuychu: Chasca... I used to think mom and dad were crazy for adopting you...
Chuychu: I was the younger sibling, but I always felt like it was my job to help mom and dad take care of you... I thought I could set you free from the Abyssal energy you struggled with...
Chuychu: I... guess I was pretty full of myself, huh? Thinking I could fix you, when... Well, we were always the same...
Chasca: Hush, Chuychu, put those thoughts right out of your mind. We'll be at the stadium in no time, okay? I'll carry you there.
Chasca: The Abyssal contamination is gone now. Just rest, and you'll get better.
Chuychu: I was always nagging you to slow down, stop rushing headlong into things...
Chuychu: I just didn't want anything to happen to you, or to anyone else because of you...
Chuychu: I worried about you so much. But now, I realize... I never really understood what it's like for you.
Chuychu: The fact that you survived an Abyssal contamination was a miracle, but it also left you in a constant state of agitation...
Chuychu: The fact that we became family was another miracle. But with me worrying about you all the time, it feels like I just agitated you even further.
Chasca: No, absolutely not. Nothing could be further from the truth, do you hear me?
Chasca: All you ever did was love me, same goes for mom and dad. I've always known that, and I feel terrible, because I really did want to get along as a family.
Chasca: It might take me some time, but I'll find a way to make it work. I'm so sorry, Chuychu, I never meant to make you feel this way...
Chuychu: It's okay, Chasca. No need to apologize. You didn't do anything wrong — no one did. It's nobody's fault that things didn't turn out great.
Chuychu: I get it now. So, no nagging from me this time.
Chuychu: ...You keep forging ahead, Sis.
Chuychu: Never slow down, and never hold back. Spread your wings and fly free, like the fiercest qucusaur in the sky. Show the world who the bravest Flower-Feather warrior is...
Chuychu: Because that's who you are... and that's the sister I'm proud of.
Chuychu: ...
Chasca: Chuychu... Chuychu!
Paimon: ...Chuychu?
Traveler: ...
Chasca: Ugh... Aaargh...
Paimon: Chasca!?
Chasca: ...
Paimon: What... happened?
Traveler: I think she's okay now.
Paimon: What was that just now? It looked like Abyssal energy was flowing out of her, but then a split-second later, it disappeared...
Traveler: Chasca managed to rein it in.
Paimon: Chuychu did say that Chasca needs to let off steam now and then, or she'll end up losing herself. But this time, she wrestled back control.
Traveler: Just like Chuychu always hoped.
Paimon: If only we were faster... Dealing with Abyssal contamination is a piece of cake for you.
Paimon: We could've gotten to her earlier, then you could've treated her before... before it was too...
Paimon: Wait... What's happening to Chasca...?
Menilek: How unfair life can be... She's had the odds stacked against her from the very beginning, and each step forward has been an agonizing one. Maybe she would have been better off embracing her pain...
Menilek: But her journey goes on, and one question looms large in her mind: If she could rise above the layers of pain, and ascend over the dark clouds of her mind... what, then, would she find?
Menilek: Maybe the glorious light of the sun, or maybe a dark, empty void. There is only one way to find out. She needs to spread her wings and soar to new heights... that is the true meaning of life.
Traveler: You're from 500 years ago...
Menilek: "My life's suffering shall be my epitaph."
Menilek: "To remember the pain I endured..."
Menilek: "...And, finally, transcended."
Chasca: ...
Paimon: ...
Chasca: Let's take Chuychu somewhere safer.
Traveler: Let's give her some space while she cools down.

## Talk 21

Chasca: Please, take care of Chuychu for me...
Chasca: I still have more important things to do.
Komina: Of course. We are grateful for her service.
Mavuika: Yes, she served selflessly.
Mavuika: I'm sorry, Chasca.
Chasca: It's alright. I'm far from the only one going through this right now.
Chasca: Chuychu wanted to be a hero, and in my heart, she always will be.
Chasca: If we want to honor what she stood for, not to mention her sacrifice... Archon, we need to hurry.
Mavuika: Mm.
Mavuika: Time for this war to end.

## Talk 22

Paimon: What the... Paimon can't believe it...

## Talk 23

Mualani: That is an outright scary level of power...
Ororon: So from now on, all warriors will be able to resurrect themselves using the sacred flame...
Chasca: That's right. No more casualties.
Iansan: It's time to wipe the enemy off the face of the earth.
Xilonen: And to reclaim our lost territory.
Kinich: This is for all those who gave their lives for Natlan.
Kinich: Everyone, let's go.
Paimon: Uh, we'll come with you.
Chasca: #Paimon. Traveler.
Chasca: I'm so grateful you got to us when you did. You gave Chuychu the chance to say those words to me before the end...
Chasca: If I'd lost control out there in the wild... This counter-attack might never have been possible.
Paimon: Probably best not to think about that. More importantly... how are you feeling now? Any better?
Chasca: Not really, but now's not the time to deal with it. In the spirit of Vu{RUBY#[D]Transcension}ka, I have to rise above it.
Chasca: The conflict and suffering in me are there to test my character. My struggle will make me stronger...
Chasca: ...And make me the person Chuychu believed I can be.
Traveler: I have faith in you.
Paimon: Alright, let's go show the Abyss what human beings are made of! They'll be sorry they messed with Natlan after we're through with them!
