Traveler: How are Nilou and Inayah doing?
Sheikh Zubayr: Nilou is teaching her to dance as we speak. However, I must say that it hasn't been easy. Dance is something that is best learned from young, I fear.
Sheikh Zubayr: Still, Inayah works so hard. Beyond the tasks that Nilou sets her, she trains independently as well.
Sheikh Zubayr: I daresay that with her current progress, she may be good enough to take the stage in but a few years.
Sheikh Zubayr: I daren't imagine, however, how many times longer that period would have been without the tutelage of someone as gifted and patient as Nilou.
