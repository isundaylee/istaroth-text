# Spike Self-Circulation Report: Experimental Procedure

Black Screen Text: After the Pursina's Spike has been moved to the tunnel depths, Hosseini arrives at the site of the rupture.
Hosseini: Well, the Spike has finally been placed.
Hosseini: *cough* According to my estimations, this should be the opening through which the Ley Lines are overflowing.
Hosseini: If we can get the Spike up and running here, we can affect the Ley Lines such that the opening can be closed...
Hosseini: I believe that this will solve our problem for good.
Traveler: Shall we start now, then?
Hosseini: No, we cannot. I must perform another round of checks. We cannot afford to have another problem like the one we faced during the test run.
Hosseini: Once the Spike is ready, we will be rid of this terrible mud and the monsters that come with it... *cough*
