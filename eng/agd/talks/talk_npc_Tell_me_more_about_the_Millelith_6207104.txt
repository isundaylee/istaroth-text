Traveler: Tell me more about the Millelith.
Fengyan: "While rock stays hard, the mountain shall never fail; while the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail."
Fengyan: The Millelith is the successor to the Millelith Brigade that served long ago during the Archon War.
Fengyan: Today, the Millelith rarely encounters any truly evil forces of the kind we are sworn to defend against. But we serve with the same rock-solid commitment as our predecessors did.
Fengyan: You may find on a day-to-day basis that some in our ranks fail to display the level of military discipline you might expect. But rest assured that if a truly diabolical threat ever did present itself, every last one of us would fight tooth and nail to protect Liyue.
