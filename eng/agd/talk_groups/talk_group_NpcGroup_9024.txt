Traveler: How do you like it here?
Beidou: Yeah, pretty good! Feels nice to sit and relax in such a scenic place!
Beidou: But...
Traveler: But what?
Beidou: But you know that I'll be craving the billowing waves of the open ocean before too long! It's where I belong.
Beidou: The churning ocean waves are the best lullaby.
Beidou: Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm thrilled that you invited me here.
Beidou: I'll have to return the favor sometime by hosting you onboard the ship!
Traveler: But you miss the sea already?
Beidou: Haha! You get me!
Beidou: Days spent sailing through a storm, conquering the surging waters... yeah, those are happy days!

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Beidou: Sure! I'm down to chat about anything!
Beidou: But, you must be a little weary of hearing about my sea travels from all the stories people tell?
Beidou: Let's change it up! Tell me about your adventures!
Traveler: Um... I fought a dragon once.
Beidou: Whoa, nice! How big was it?
Beidou: Hahaha, incredible!
Beidou: So I fought a sea dragon, and you fought a sky dragon.
Beidou: If we went adventuring together, we'd be invincible!
Traveler: Most of them involve fighting hilichurls...
Beidou: How's that? I certainly don't see many of those out at sea!
Beidou: But adventure isn't just about how many storms you've survived in the past — it's about knowing that there are plenty more storms up ahead, and you don't know what they've got in store for ya!
Beidou: Hey, that sounded pretty profound now that I think about it...
Beidou: Haha, this was a great chat! And now, a toast! Cheers!
Traveler: Probably bigger than your ship.

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Traveler: *Anything you'd like to do?*
Beidou: What do you think? I wanna take you out to sea on an adventure, of course!
Beidou: I can teach you how to steer a ship if you're interested.
Beidou: You know, no two waves are ever the same...
Beidou: If you're free, it'd be a shame not to take the opportunity to show you 'round the seas.
Traveler: I'll need to prepare.
Beidou: Sure thing. Just say the word.
Beidou: Oh, uh... And if you've got any unfinished business, best take care of that first then call me when you're done.
Beidou: One voyage takes about one and a half years, but that's just a rough estimate.
Beidou: So, you should tie up any loose ends before we set sail!
Beidou: Anyway — let me know when you're done prepping, and we'll pick a date to set off!
Beidou: The thought of you and I conquering the seas together... I can't wait!
Traveler: I'm worried that I'll get seasick.
Beidou: Don't be afraid. Don't let that hold you back.
Beidou: You'll get used to the ocean's movements soon enough. If you're really struggling, I have some medicinal herbs.
Beidou: I guarantee you, it'll be fine. Trust me on this.
Beidou: It'd be a pity if you missed out on a voyage across the seas because of something like that!
