Traveler: How's business been?
Karpillia: It's not bad. After all, liquor from Mondstadt is the best in Teyvat.
Karpillia: The moment the Sakoku Decree ended, I had clients coming up to me to place some orders. And what do you know â€” Mondstadt's Dandelion Wine was number one on the list!
Karpillia: Now that the thunderstorm surrounding Inazuma has dispersed, cargo-carrying ships should be able to get here quickly. Once that happens, never mind our clientele... I'll be able to get a good drink myself.
Karpillia: *cough* I mean, after work, of course!
