Traveler: Do you like taking photos?
Pele Nui: I like it a lot! Compared to scenery, though, I prefer taking pictures of people.
Pele Nui: I've shot a lot of family photos, enough to make several big albums. Out of my family members, my niece Haloa humors me the most â€” you can see her in nearly all the photos.
Pele Nui: Oh, and I also like getting pictures with famous people. I've asked for a picture with every hero and warrior who's come here for a dip.
