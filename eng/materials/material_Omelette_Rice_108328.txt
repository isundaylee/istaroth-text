# Omelette Rice

A main dish wrapped up in an egg skin. The evenly beaten egg fluids are fried into half-doneness before being poured out on top of the rice, and tomato ketchup is drizzled over top afterward once it is ready to plate up. They say that this dish was derived from another region, though this version involves a more complicated cooking method.
