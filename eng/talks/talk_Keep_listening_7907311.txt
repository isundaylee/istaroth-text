Xudi: This shelf once had all it dreamed of, yet lost it all as well. He was exhausted... Once brand new and beautiful, he was now old and weathered, and missing a few of his boards to boot.
Xudi: Once the shelf of the wealthy, and of an artist... But now that these things that once filled his life were gone, who was he?
Xudi: Finally, the shelf returned to the kingdom, sequestering himself in the corner of a library, and there lived alone.
Xudi: "I'm a useless shelf," he thought sadly. "Bereft of those jewels and paintings, I am of no worth."
