Traveler: A face you've never seen before?
Tiger Li: I was on the first big ship that returned to Liyue together with my brother, so I know everyone who was on that ship.
Tiger Li: But I've never seen you before, and that means you must've been on one of the later ships.
Tiger Li: According to our customs, that makes you my junior!
Tiger Li: So if you ever run into any troubles, just come and find me!
