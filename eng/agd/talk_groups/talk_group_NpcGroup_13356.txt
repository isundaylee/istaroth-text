Lamiya: Data from two more users of the Inscribed Mirror. Hehe, if we get more good test data, then the product can be released soon...
Lamiya: #Traveler, what's the matter? Any questions about the experiment... er, the trial challenge?

Traveler: Since the Akasha is being used...
Lamiya: Oh? You mean, "Why do we still use the Inscribed Mirror since we already are using Akasha technology," right?
Lamiya: Considering the differences between animal and human brains, using the Akasha directly has a relatively high risk at this stage.
Lamiya: Also, as only the sense of vision is connected, though you may see from the animal's perspective, it's still your own body moving...
Lamiya: Consider what would happen if connected to the vision of a bird. Visually, you are flying, and it is hard to control a fear of heights or your instinctual movement. It would definitely cause accidents...
Lamiya: Hehe, so the mirrors are better for the time being.

Traveler: How are Inscribed Mirrors used?
Lamiya: First hold the mirror in your hand, and then touch it to activate the response.
Lamiya: The mirror is showing the animal's perspective now.
Lamiya: Of course, it has been edited. Many animals see the world very differently from us... but as it is made for people to use, we must tweak the image to be more acceptable.
Lamiya: Hehe, Kshahrewar researchers wouldn't worry about that. How nice...

Traveler: No, no problems.
Lamiya: Hehe, hope you make it through the trial challenge smoothly... No! For the sake of the test data, you MUST complete the trial challenge at all costs!
