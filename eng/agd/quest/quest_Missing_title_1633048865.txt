## Talk 1

Jean: Thank you for accepting our invitation, traveler.
Traveler: How do we fight Stormterror?
Jean: Its change in size and power really is suspicious.
Jean: But for the Knights of Favonius, our priority is to deal with the aftermath of this attack.
Jean: The Grand Master entrusted the Knights of Favonius to me. I cannot let him or the people of Mondstadt down.
Jean: I must get to the bottom of this...
Traveler: Are all the knights as... "strict" as Amber?
Jean: I heard you and Outrider Amber had a misunderstanding.
Jean: Please forgive her. She was just doing her job.
Jean: Talk to Amber sometime. I'm sure you'll like how energetic she always is.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Jean: #Thanks again for your help, Traveler.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Phew, it's finally done.
Paimon: Well, all that "ley flow" and "elemental lines" stuff Lisa was going on about should hopefully be back to normal.
Paimon: Wanna go back and see how the *Knights* are doing?
Paimon: But if you got anything more interesting to do, Paimon can come too!
Paimon: By the way, we obtained another Anemoculus in one of The Four Winds' temples, right?
Paimon: We might come across more of them in the future, so don't forget to offer them to the Statues!
