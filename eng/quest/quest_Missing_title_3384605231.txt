# Missing title (3384605231)

Traveler: Have you gained anything from your trip so far?
Stevens: Ugh, don't get me started. Iris is far too busy, so I've had to scale the mountain myself... Almost lost my life in the process, never mind finding any ancient texts.
Stevens: But I wouldn't say that I gained nothing from all this. I did find some other things, such as this crown.
Stevens: My guess is that this was left behind by those who once wanted to conquer Dragonspine. One can only wonder as to the trials and tribulations they must have encountered.
Stevens: ...I fear we can only discover a few things about the past through these relics...
Stevens: Ugh, sorry, I'm rambling... I've already gleaned all I could from this item. From the looks of you, you must be an adventurer, so why don't you take this with you?
Stevens: Don't stand on ceremony â€” it's no use to me anyway, and what's more, I may require your assistance in the future, too.
