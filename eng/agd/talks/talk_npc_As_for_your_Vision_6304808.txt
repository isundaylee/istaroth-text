Traveler: As for your Vision?
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: It was confiscated due to the Vision Hunt Decree. It's nothing special really, it happened to others too.
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: As for my opinion on the Vision Hunt Decree... Now? I don't have an opinion anymore.
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: Then, some people reported that I had been slacking off at work due to my discontent with the Vision Hunt Decree... And you saw what happened.
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: I can't remember what my opinions were like before... And I don't really care about them anymore.
