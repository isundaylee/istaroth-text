# Adventure in the Land of Mists


## Talk 1

Paimon: Paimon didn't expect Coco to lead us here. This strange fortress looks just like the place where we met you, Bona.
Paimon: Look, it even has the same mural! Minus the smear marks, though. Is it because we're higher up?
Paimon: #Look, Traveler! This must be the Python King that Bona mentioned. He sure looks mean!
Bona: Yes, that's the Python King Och-Kan. Legend has it that he abused and oppressed his people to get the Tonatiuh built, and eventually attracted the Abyss, which led to his death and the downfall of the kingdom.
Bona: But that's just a legend. After all, the storytellers in my tribe have told different tales about what happened to him.
Bona: Maybe he's still roaming the Tonatiuh and feasting on his treasure. Or maybe the evil dragon that's been trying to stop us is his ghost!
Cocouik: Kuchi...
Paimon: Please stop with the stories! You're scaring Coco!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Rawr!
Paimon: #{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} sure has been eager to do something since we defeated the dragon. Is he in some kind of secret contest with Coco?
Paimon: Anyway, where's this Altar we're looking for?
Bona: If Coco was right, it should be below us... Wait, I thought it'd be somewhere higher up.
Bona: Did we mess up? The Altar of Primal Flame can't be inside the mountain, can it? How would we be transported into the sky then, unless the mountain itself collapses?
Traveler: There could be a special transportation mode at play...
Paimon: Well, what now, then? You were so sure while we were down there. And we can't understand what Coco is trying to say, either.
Cocouik: Kulu...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Rawr!
Paimon: #Any ideas, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}?
Bona: I think I get it now. It's trying to tell us that following rigid logic won't get us anywhere!
Paimon: Wait, you made that up, didn't you?
Bona: Well, regardless of what's below us, I say we go check it out. I mean, we're on an adventure, aren't we?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: #Huh, you sure are excited, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}. Well, time to figure out how to get down there.

## Talk 2

Bona: Found anything?
Bona: Let's look a bit harder and see if we can find any contraptions or secret passages!

## Talk 3

Paimon: #It's open! You're awesome, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}! We wouldn't have found the mechanism without you!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: #I knew you could do it, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}.
Paimon: But don't get ahead of yourself. Plenty of challenges await us!
Paimon: Now that the entrance is open, there's no reason to give up halfway.
Bona: I concur, Paimon.
Cocouik: Cheep... Cheep!
Bona: What's wrong? Why don't you want to go in? Are you scared? We're halfway through our journey â€” there's no turning back now!
Cocouik: Ku...
Paimon: You shouldn't force the issue, Bona. It really does look super scared. Could there be something super dangerous down there?
Traveler: I'm scared too!
Paimon: #Now, really? C'mon, pull yourself together like {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}, why don't you?
Traveler: This is kind of exciting.
Paimon: Paimon didn't think you'd be so pumped up. But you can probably take on anyone we find down there, so...
Traveler: Don't worry, our little Saurian's a brave soul.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr... Rawr!
Paimon: If Coco really is afraid, maybe we should have it stay behind... But not alone. That wouldn't work...
Bona: I guess there's no other way. I'll stay with Coco up here. You can have the Pyrophosphorite.
Bona: But, whatever you find down there, you have to come back and find me, alright!
Traveler: We don't leave anyone behind.
Bona: I believe in you. We'll wait for you here.
Traveler: Don't worry, just wait here until we come back.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!

## Talk 4

Bona: Wow, that was a shocker! Thank goodness for our quick reactions.
Bona: So, did you find anything?
Paimon: Well, we did find something that looks like a mechanism, but it's kind of a pain...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Bona: #Oh, I don't know what you mean, but {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} looks pretty clued in, so let's check it out anyway!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Ugh, what's this? It looks gross...
Bona: This is nascent Abyssal Blight. Looks like it's seeping down from above... Hmm, I thought a place festooned with frescoes would be safer.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rrah... Rawr!
Bona: Huh? Uh-oh, I think something's gonna fall down. Watch out, everyone!
