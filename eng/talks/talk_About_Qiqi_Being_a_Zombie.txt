Traveler: About Qiqi Being a Zombie
Paimon: Do you think that Qiqi... needs to drink blood?
Traveler: That's not a zombie, Paimon, that's a vampire.
Paimon: Then, will her arms fall off suddenly?
Traveler: That's also not a zombie, that's a ghoul.
Paimon: uh. As expected of a traveler. You really know a lot!
Paimon: So, what special thing can zombies do?
Traveler: Exercises?
Paimon: That makes a lot of sense! So zombies are the ones that can perform exercises!
