Flora: Ooh, you're great! This is even better than when Mr. Sayid plays it! He performed this one for us last Windblume Festival, saying that it was a traditional song from Sumeru.
Flora: Donna said it sounded terrible compared to Master Diluc's playing, though.
Flora: Well, I've made up my mind. The flowers need care every day, and Inazuma's pretty far away, so I'm afraid I can't go.
Flora: Thanks for the music, though. It was lovely. On that note, I'll offer you a special price if you need flowers for your festival!
