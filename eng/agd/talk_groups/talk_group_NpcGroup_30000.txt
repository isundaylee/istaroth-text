Traveler: About the three towers...
Tsumi: Each of the towers is positioned on top of a leyline junction, and they are used to maintain balance between vishaps, the Abyss, and humans.
Tsumi: After being modified by that person, they are currently enhancing the powers of the Abyss.

Traveler: About you, Tsumi...
Tsumi: I am of little note.
Tsumi: Just one life among many. My present concerns are how to survive... and how to help my brethren.

### Talk 0 related talk 2

Traveler: About the Sentou...
Tsumi: The Sentou ceremony used to be used to chase vishaps away. This is the clash between the human and vishap realms.
Tsumi: Once the Daninichi Mikoshi was built, the Sentou ceremony was used less and less. However, as a secret art of the human realm, it can certainly still serve as an effective measure against the darkness.
