Traveler: I see you're the same as ever...
Furong: Well, I am a sailor on the Alcor, after all, and in charge of fighting, too!
Furong: ...And don't you judge me on account of my size, now. Even Chief Mate Juza's hasn't got my strength. Why, he's never beaten me in a single round of arm wrestling!
Furong: I'll just say it now by the by, I won't marry anyone unless they can go a round with me and win. It's as simple as that.
Furong: Shame, but the only person who's won against me... is Captain Beidou, of course.
Furong: That said, things might go differently if you decided to give it a go, heh.
