Traveler: How do you like it here?
Kaeya: Oh, I feel quite at home already.
Kaeya: Hmm, although I feel that "at home" doesn't express my feelings in their entirety.
Kaeya: "Surprised" is more how I'd describe the feeling I had when I first set eyes on this place.
Traveler: You mean, pleasantly surprised?
Kaeya: Exactly that.
Kaeya: It's more beautiful than I imagined.
Kaeya: It's been a while since I moved here though, so the initial sense of surprise has mostly worn off. Now, this place feels comfortable, like somewhere I belong.
Kaeya: Heh, who'd have thought...
Traveler: As in, it was a nasty surprise?
Kaeya: What? Of course not! It was a very pleasant surprise.
