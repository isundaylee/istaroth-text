# Woven Wishes


## Talk 1

Kamisato Ayaka: This is it, the International Trade Association.
Paimon: Okay, then... we need to talk to Kurisu, right?
Paimon: Doesn't look like he's here. Let's look around!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Look, look! There he is!
Kamisato Ayaka: Ah, looks like we found him.
Kurisu: *whimpering* What am I going to do...
Kamisato Ayaka: Mr. Kurisu, are you alright?
Kurisu: Oh! You're M—Miss Ayaka from the K—Kamisato Clan. How do you do?
Kamisato Ayaka: Better than you, it appears.
Kurisu: And if it isn't the Traveler... I haven't seen you in a while — I take it you've been out of Ritou?
Traveler: It sure has been a bit.
Kurisu: Thanks again for your help last time. The Association is back in business, and it's all thanks to you.
Paimon: That's great, but uh... Why were you staring into space just now? Did something bad happen?
Kurisu: Well... You see... *sigh*
Kurisu: It's embarrassing to admit, but some of the Association's goods have been... stolen. By vagrants.
Kamisato Ayaka: Which goods were stolen?
Kurisu: It was a batch of high-grade silk.
Kamisato Ayaka: ...!
Kurisu: We imported a big batch of silk from Liyue several years ago. It's been sitting in storage ever since.
Kurisu: Recently, we heard that clothing stores in the city have more or less sold off all their silk stocks. So we figured now would be a good time to bring our batch out of storage, thinking it'd probably fetch a good price. But then...
Kurisu: The vagrants swiped the whole batch then disappeared into the woods. I'd report it to the authorities, but...
Kurisu: Well, as you know, they don't think much of foreign merchants like us. The Kanjou Commission don't want to give us the time of day — honestly, you can just tell that our suffering amuses them...
Kamisato Ayaka: While I also take issue with aspects of the Kanjou Commission's operational methods, please remember, Mr. Kurisu, that while you are here in Inazuma, you should be careful with your words.
Kurisu: Oh! M—My apologies... I had to let off some steam...
Kurisu: Anyway, there doesn't seem to be much we can do ourselves to get our goods back.
Kurisu: *sigh* Perhaps I'm doomed to go bankrupt after all...
Kamisato Ayaka: I'm afraid I can't intervene in an official capacity... but I can still help you get your lost goods back.
Kurisu: Of course, I would never— Wait, what!?
Paimon: What!?
Traveler: Seriously?
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes. Acting in my own capacity, mind you. Even then, there is no escaping the fact that my every action and word will be seen to reflect on the Yashiro Commission and the Kamisato Clan.
Kamisato Ayaka: I do so not without reservations, so... I hope that you will treat this matter as confidential.
Kamisato Ayaka: That aside — as I'm sure you're aware, I'm afraid that I won't always be able to help you in such circumstances.
Kamisato Ayaka: Given your position and that of the International Trade Association... please try to exercise more caution in the future. You do not want to incur further unnecessary losses.
Kurisu: We will, we certainly will!
Kurisu: But, um... are you sure this isn't going to cause any issues... for you?
Kurisu: What if someone high up in the Kanjou Commission sees what you're doing and doesn't like it? You're a highly respected member of society... Surely, putting your neck on the line for small-timers like me can't be worth the risk!?
Kamisato Ayaka: Very humorous.
Kamisato Ayaka: Let's not forget that I am the eldest daughter of the Kamisato Clan. I would be very surprised indeed if anybody in the Kanjou Commission felt that I was accountable to them for my actions.
Paimon: Whoa, that sent shivers down Paimon's spine! Does everyone from a powerful clan talk like that?
Kamisato Ayaka: Mr. Kurisu, I need to know the exact time and location of the theft, and anything that stood out about the perpetrators' appearance.
Kurisu: Thank you so much! Let's see, it was two hours ago now, over at the...
Kamisato Ayaka: Everyone, please follow me to the scene of the crime. The investigation starts there...
Paimon: Alright, off we go!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Stop, thief!
Ronin: Hah! You think you can get your stuff back with this bunch? You must be dreaming.
Kurisu: Why you... You better hope you have the courage of your convictions...
Ronin: Why wouldn't I, old man? Answer me this — you're one of those outlander merchants, right?
Ronin: You trade association types are worms, coming over to our land, leeching off our people... Who's gonna leap to your defense, huh? Tell me, who's gonna stick their neck out for the likes of you?
Kamisato Ayaka: ...
Ronin: Hahaha! Look at that, no response. You know I'm right.
Ronin: Face it. This is Inazuma, you've got no ties here, you're at the bottom of the pile... Can you really blame us for walking all over you?
Kurisu: ...You are despicable...
Ronin: Hey! I just had an idea. Since you came all this way — how about we do some business?
Kurisu: Business?
Ronin: Pay up, and you can take your fabric back. Sound good? If you ask me, it beats walking out of here with black eyes and a broken nose.
Paimon: *gasp* You're just a big bully!
Kurisu: I... Ugh! What choice do I have...
Kamisato Ayaka: Wait.
Kamisato Ayaka: Mr. Kurisu, please do not pay any money to this man.
Kurisu: But, but...
Kamisato Ayaka: I trust you remember our agreement? If you keep your lips firmly sealed, I, too, shall uphold my end of the deal.
Kurisu: Oh, yes, of course!
Kamisato Ayaka: Then please stand well back, where it is safe. Now... it is time for me to honor my word.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Well, that's that resolved then!
Kamisato Ayaka: ...Phew.
Traveler: That was amazing, Ayaka.
Kamisato Ayaka: No, please, I... It was nothing, I was simply doing my duty.
Kurisu: Miss Kamisato, Traveler, a—are you hurt!?
Kamisato Ayaka: Don't worry. We're fine.
Kamisato Ayaka: The vagrants left in quite a hurry — it would seem they didn't have time to take anything with them. I believe your stolen goods should all be here.
Kurisu: Th—Thank you, thank you so much...
Kamisato Ayaka: You'd best do a count.
Kurisu: 6, 8, 10... Yep, it's all here!
Paimon: Great! Now we can finally buy some silk!
Kurisu: Buy silk? ...You mean, you need some of this silk, here?
Kamisato Ayaka: This was indeed our intent.
Paimon: Don't get us wrong though, that's not the reason we helped you out! Even if it were just a few Carrots or Cabbages, chances are we still would've helped you get them back.
Paimon: Paimon thinks we were pretty lucky! If we'd arrived any later, our chances of getting silk in Inazuma would have been zero...
Kurisu: I honestly can't thank you all enough...
Kurisu: Please, say no more! You need silk? I'll pick out a piece for you right away!
Kamisato Ayaka: Thank you, good sir. How much do I owe you?
Kurisu: Oh, it's free of charge! I could never ask you to pay after everything you've done for me!
Kamisato Ayaka: No, no, that will never do. Things cost what they cost, and what they cost is what I shall pay.
Kamisato Ayaka: Merchants already have enough challenges to deal with, and as Paimon explained, my help was unconditional. Please, sell your wares to me at the price you would sell them to any other customer.
Kamisato Ayaka: There is nothing to feel distressed about, because nothing, I repeat, nothing, happened here in these woods today. Did it?
Traveler: Nope, just an uneventful stroll in the woods.
Kurisu: Thank you, I... I don't think I could ever repay you. You have helped me greatly, and I will never forget it.
Kurisu: I'm afraid we must part ways — I must get these goods back to the Association. If you ever need anything at all, just come to the International Trade Association and ask for Kurisu!
Kamisato Ayaka: Very well, and thank you for the silk, Mr. Kurisu.
Paimon: See ya then, bye! Safe journey home, don't go getting robbed again!
Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler, thank you for stepping in to help out.
Traveler: No worries, it's what I signed up for.
Paimon: But... how come those vagrants didn't seem to know who you were? They must move in completely different circles, maybe they've never seen anyone from the Kamisato Clan before?
Kamisato Ayaka: Perhaps. Either way, I'm glad they didn't recognize me. The fewer people who know what happened today, the better.
Paimon: Hee-hee, it's not every day an important person like you helps out someone like Kurisu. It really shows what a great person you are.
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, uh... Your praise is quite unwarranted. I merely did what anyone in my position would have done...
Kamisato Ayaka: I admit that it did feel strange for me to come to his aid... But this should have nothing to do with identity, or social class... As far as I'm concerned, it was one individual helping another in need.
Kamisato Ayaka: I guess that deep down... I don't see how a society can be considered just when people encounter such obstacles in their livelihoods...
Kamisato Ayaka: Ah! Sorry, I'm getting off topic.
Traveler: No problem.
Kamisato Ayaka: Right. Let's head back to Ogura Textiles & Kimonos and give our hard-won silk to the shopkeeper.
Paimon: Okay!
Traveler: It was no trouble.
Traveler: You made that look so easy!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Hey there, we're back!
Ogura Mio: Welcome back!
Ogura Mio: So, any luck at the International Trade Association? Did they have any silk in stock?
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes, they did.
Kamisato Ayaka: Here.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Hey there, we're back!
Ogura Mio: Welcome back!
Ogura Mio: So, any luck at the International Trade Association? Did they have any silk in stock?
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes, they did.
Kamisato Ayaka: Here.
Ogura Mio: Excellent news! So, apart from the silk, I think everything else I need, I've got in store already...
Ogura Mio: I just need to go and take stock of our materials — it won't take me a moment. I'll be right back.
Paimon: They'd better be all there!
Kamisato Ayaka: I do hope nothing else is missing.
Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler, on the subject of garments, I've been meaning to acquire a new outfit for you, too.
Traveler: It's a kind thought, but I'm fine with my current outfit.
Kamisato Ayaka: It's just... I wasn't sure how you'd feel about the idea of dressing in Inazuman attire...
Traveler: These clothes are special to me.
Traveler: If I'm too concerned about my appearance, I'll lose my edge in battle.
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh? Are you sure?
Kamisato Ayaka: Is that so...
Kamisato Ayaka: Impressive... So, travelers of your stature hold themselves to a dress code, as well as a code of conduct.
Paimon: Hmm... More like, when you're away from home, you've gotta live by certain rules to survive, whether you like it or not.
Traveler: Do they do Paimon sizes here?
Paimon: But Paimon would still love to check out some Inazuman outfits!
Paimon: Just what is that supposed to mean? They make them in whatever size the customer asks for!
Traveler: Ayaka, you're too kind.
Traveler: Thanks, but Paimon and I are fine as we are.
Kamisato Ayaka: Hahaha, ah, your interactions are so adorable to watch... Ahem! I mean, um... I can certainly find someone to tailor a Paimon-sized outfit, if Paimon so wishes.
Kamisato Ayaka: Hm, well if you're sure... As you wish.
Traveler: They dress very strangely.
Traveler: They dress very stylishly.
Kamisato Ayaka: Something else I've been wondering is... how do people in other nations dress?
Paimon: It's so true — people dress in all kinds of ways!
Paimon: Some people like to wear a hood, some cover up half their face with a mask, some just straight-up dress like a peacock... Oh, and some have their tummy on show, others wear skin-tight leotards and leggings... If you can imagine it, Paimon guarantees that someone out there is wearing it!
Kamisato Ayaka: Really? So there is no single standard, and people just dress however they like?
Kamisato Ayaka: So fascinating... Somehow, I feel a little envious...
Paimon: Wait, so you wanna dress like a peacock now?
Kamisato Ayaka: No, of course not! I—I just mean... I admire those who are able to do as they please.
Kamisato Ayaka: I would very much like to travel across the seven nations... and see how people live.
Paimon: They sure do! Each nation has its own unique style — traditional, fancy-schmancy, casual... All very different, but each style is suited to its region.
Kamisato Ayaka: The study of clothing is a profound discipline, and I have much still to learn.
Kamisato Ayaka: When clothing becomes part of the expression of one's personality, even an extension of one's body... That is quite a wonderful thing.
Kamisato Ayaka: So I am not against dressing up, far from it.
Paimon: Paimon agrees! You couldn't have put it any better!
Kamisato Ayaka: Paimon, you're so adorable that you could wear anything and it would look lovely on you.
Paimon: Wow! Hee-hee, Paimon just got a compliment!
Ogura Mio: Sorry to keep you waiting! I've checked my inventory.
Kamisato Ayaka: Thank you, is there anything else you're missing?
Ogura Mio: Fortunately not! I have all the materials I need. As for the size — would you like me to go by the dimensions given on the design?
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes please.
Ogura Mio: Understood, I'll get to work shortly. In total, that'll be... this much!
Kamisato Ayaka: Here you go. Is it possible to treat this as an urgent order?
Ogura Mio: Well, luckily, we don't have any other urgents at the moment, so I can begin work right away. It will still take me some time, though, so please come and collect it later.
Ogura Mio: Until then, I'm sure you'll find somewhere nearby to pass the time.
Paimon: Good idea! Let's check out the whole area, we don't wanna leave any loose ends.
Kamisato Ayaka: Haha, there will be no loose ends while you're in my company. I already decided where to go while we wait.
Kamisato Ayaka: For our next stop, I'd like to take you both for a meal.
Traveler: Perfect, I'm getting a little hungry myself.
Paimon: Fooood! Ooh, Paimon likes this plan!
Kamisato Ayaka: Mm-hmm, I picked the venue especially for you — a humble local eatery called Kiminami Restaurant.
Kamisato Ayaka: I thought that the relaxed atmosphere there would suit our day much better than the prohibitively formal one of a high-end restaurant.
Kamisato Ayaka: Shall we head off?
Paimon: Yup yup, Paimon can't wait!

## Talk 7

Ogura Mio: I do hope you manage to get hold of your silk.

## Talk 8

Ogura Mio: I do hope you manage to get hold of your silk.
