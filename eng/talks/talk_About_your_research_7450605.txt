Traveler: About your research...
Lepine-Pauline: Oh! You're really interested in my academic theories?
Lepine-Pauline: If you want to learn the essential elements of my theories, I'll be happy to share them with you!
Lepine-Pauline: However, I don't really have any core reference materials or papers for my theory yet, since I just don't have the time to sit down and write any papers. My reference materials are also a bit scattered.
Lepine-Pauline: After all, I was so busy dealing with all sorts of outsourcing requests from the Fontaine Research Institute, that I simply didn't have the time to do any formal academic writing.
Lepine-Pauline: I recently pieced together the importance of the "Graph Adversarial Technology" discipline from various bits of literature, and then immediately began this project, and didn't even consider creating introductory materials.
Lepine-Pauline: "Graph Adversarial Technology" is a very difficult academic discipline with a high barrier to entry. If you're absolutely sure you want to study it, I will certainly share all of my knowledge with you, and hold absolutely nothing back, not even the slightest detail!
Lepine-Pauline: Of course, only if we can finish the task at hand first, hahahahaha!
