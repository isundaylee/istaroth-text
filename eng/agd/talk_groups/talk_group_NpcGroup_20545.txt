Memorial Stone: ..."With Liyue behind us, we fought bravely, warriors all — we feared death not, and not an inch did we yield."
Memorial Stone: ..."We accomplished the task Rex Lapis gave us, and we did not betray the people's hopes — let this stone be our witness."
Memorial Stone: ..."The years may erode all, yet the Millelith shall never be moved."
