Traveler: That sound kinda weird...
Yantasar: That's because being "weird" is precisely our selling point! I don't know about visitors from other places, but us Natlan natives go in for that kind of thing.
Yantasar: Maybe it's the part about blessings from the Wayob and all that. Sounds pretty tempting, huh?
Yantasar: To tell you the honest truth... there's actually nothing special about these drinks. But people walk away feeling like they're on cloud nine!
Yantasar: But there's nothing to knock about the drinks themselves. Our ingredients are high quality, and very healthy too.
