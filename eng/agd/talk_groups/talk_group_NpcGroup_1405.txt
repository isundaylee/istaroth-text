Traveler: About Stormterror...
Anna: *cough* To tell the truth, I made a wish to the fountain fairy when the dragon attacked, wishing that it would keep Mondstadt safe.

Traveler: The fountain fairy?
Anna: Yes. I heard from Anthony that he was able to get a prescription from Liyue Harbor.
Anna: To think that he was able to get a prescription from such a distant place so smoothly... the fountain fairy might have heard my wishes after all.
Anna: She must have protected Anthony and helped him to obtain that prescription.
Anna: Once I've made a fully recovery, I must make a trip to Springvale...
