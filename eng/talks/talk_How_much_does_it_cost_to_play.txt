Ruijin: How much does it cost to play?
Ruijin: Well, I've only just finished designing this board game and would like to hear what people think of such a game.
Ruijin: So, during the Lantern Rite, it won't cost anyone a single Mora to play. All you need is a Xiao Lantern and you can play one round.
Ruijin: If you'd like to give it a try, just let me know.
