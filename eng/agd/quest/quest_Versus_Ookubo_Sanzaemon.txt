Ookubo Sanzaemon: You need not know who that is, for you shall be defeated here by my hand. Come, let us begin!
Traveler: Let us cross swords.
Ookubo Sanzaemon: Excellent! My sword shall show no mercy.
Traveler: Give me a second to prepare.
Ookubo Sanzaemon: Fair enough, but do not make me wait too long.
