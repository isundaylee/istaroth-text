# Good Hunter Express


## Talk 1

Traveler: Sorry, but I'm busy right now.
Sara: It's fine, I can wait — turnabout is fair play, after all.

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'll deliver it right now.
Sara: Thanks, you're a lifesaver!
Sara: You might want to be careful while you deliver it. <color=#00E1FFFF>Don't touch any elements, and don't take too big a step</color>, now.
Sara: You do have to be quick about it, though. Wallit's impatience is pretty well-known around here.

## Talk 3

Short-Tempered Wallit: Come on, why isn't it here yet?

## Talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Sara: Yup, Wallit ordered some Fisherman's Toast today before heading off to the Stone Gate on the border between Mondstadt and Liyue.
Sara: Really, though, who orders take-out for finger food?
