# Missing title (277742511)


## Talk 1

Sumida: What a pretty bracelet! What a pretty vase! Goods from Liyue sure are pretty!
Sumida: ...Uh, wait, no. These simplistic terminologies will simply not do for a novelist like me.
Sumida: Perhaps I should purchase one of these ingeniously-made porcelain trinkets and use it as reference material for my next novel...
Sumida: Mm, yes, yes! That's what we'll write.
Sumida: "The key to the turnaround was a Vision concealed within the vase!"
Sumida: Yes, that could be quite interesting indeed! What do you think, Kama?
Kama: Lady Sumida, I don't really...
Kama: ...
Kama: I feel that any descriptions of this vase should be well-controlled. If you spend too much time on it, the foreshadowing will become quite apparent. But at the same time, mentioning it too little will make that development seem abrupt.
Sumida: Hmm, you do have a point indeed! Let me write this down...
Sumida: Wait, no, let's do that somewhere else.
Sumida: Also, haven't I told you a thousand times before not to call me "Lady"?
Sumida: ...But then again, having one of a pair of seemingly ordinary travelers call the other "Lady" or "Lord" isn't that uncommon a plot development either, is it?

## Talk 2

Sumida: Phew— That felt good—
Sumida: Or should I say "this is how the largest library in the north should be"? To think that I'd have the opportunity to finish the whole Vera's Melancholy series in one go! Ah, that was wonderful!
Kama: Lady Sumida, it might be best to keep your voice down.
Sumida: Ah, right. Sorry. I was getting too excited there...
Kama: No, I'm worried that you might get hurt. That librarian has an immense aura around her...
Sumida: Eh? Really? I thought she was a rather typical, slightly-lazy witch.
Sumida: ...Hmm, but now that you mention it, these characters do tend to be the strongest. Um, right then, best not to get on her bad side...
Sumida: Actually, I could write a story based on just such a character, couldn't I? Something like "The Mage of the Great Library"...
Traveler: How have your travels been going?
Kama: Ah. It's been a while.
Sumida: #Oh ho, if it isn't the legendary {NICKNAME}...
Sumida: Our travels? ...Hmm, you know, I used to go out to travel to collect reference material a lot.
Sumida: I went to Musoujin Gorge to study how to write thunderstorms, headed to the Serpent's Head to learn how to describe a snake demon, I got Kama to join the military to better understand the lives of the Absconders...
Traveler: Man, being Kama's a tough job.
Kama: It wasn't much.
Sumida: But this on the other hand is a real journey. One with no real objective in mind.
Sumida: Only now have I discovered that there are just so many interesting things worth writing about in this world, just like in Kino's Travels.
Sumida: Kama and I visited the recommended sights and stores around these parts before camping out in the wild, exchanging stories with unfamiliar travelers by the campfire...
Sumida: ...And when we woke up, we found our belongings all missing...
Traveler: ...Wait. So did that turn out okay in the end?
Sumida: It did. Honestly, when we found out that the gang of thieves had ten or more members, I thought we weren't getting our stuff back.
Sumida: But somehow, Kama was able to convince them to return our things. They even gave him these coins with raven insignias on them to go!
Sumida: Shame... I thought that this would make for an interesting story, but Kama wouldn't tell me how it all went down.
Traveler: ...
Kama: I simply did as I should. You need not worry, Lady Sumida.
Sumida: You really are indispensable, Kama!
Sumida: With you by my side, I doubt we'd have any trouble, even if our adventures took us to the edge of the world itself!
Sumida: Speaking of which, you really have changed a lot since the whole incident with Tsurumi Island. There are things you want to do now, and opinions and doubts you want to express...
Kama: Well, if you do not find it suitable, Lady Sumida...
Sumida: No, no, I think it's great! Your views are all well-worth considering.
Traveler: Well, I'll leave the two of you alone then.
Sumida: #Indeed. See you, {NICKNAME}. Let's meet at the end of all things, just like in "Flowers for Princess Fischl."
Kama: #See you, {NICKNAME}. Take care of yourself.
Traveler: Perhaps we'll meet again in some other place.
Traveler: You're pretty good, Kama.

## Talk 3

Sumida: "The world is vast and infinite..."
Kama: Is that a quote from "Joururi Kidoutai"?
Sumida: That's right. Your memory's pretty sharp, Kama.
Kama: It was a story you told me, after all.

## Talk 4

Kama: Lady Sumida, do you have any plans as to where we should go next?
Sumida: Hmm... Now I've heard that Mondstadt is home to a very large library...
