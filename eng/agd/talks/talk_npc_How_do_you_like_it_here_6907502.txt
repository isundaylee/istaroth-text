Traveler: How do you like it here?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...
Traveler: Whâ€”What is it?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Hey, you own this place. What are you so nervous about? It's not a good look.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...It's nothing. I was just thinking about something inane.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: In your, uh... realm, some areas are completely empty.
Traveler: There's no need to fill everything to the brim. Empty space has a beauty of its own.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: You're right. Look at me, coming around here, criticizing your lifestyle choices.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: It's generous of you to host me in your home. The least I could do is be grateful.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: This is your home. Arrange it as you wish.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: I'm just another person passing through.
Traveler: I'd place more things if I could, but I can't.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: I get it. There are always going to be those things that are just beyond our ability to manage.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: With some things, they improve over time. With other things, the most you can do is to maintain the status quo.
Traveler: If there's something you want to say, just say it.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Hmph.
