Traveler: What a pity...
Chaonan: The problem is my personality... That, and luck not being on my side.
Chaonan: *sigh* It's funny, you know, the day before I signed up I even made a point of going out and buying this feather, which is supposed to bring good luck. Clearly, it had no effect whatsoever...
Chaonan: ...Well, no use complaining about it. Here, you can have it, maybe it works better on adventurers.
