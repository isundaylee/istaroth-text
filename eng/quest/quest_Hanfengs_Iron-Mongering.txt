# Hanfeng's Iron-Mongering


## Talk 1

Traveler: About Iron Chunks...
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": Right, right... the commission I posted. So, have you brought me ten Iron Chunks?
Traveler: Here they are.
Traveler: Nope, still working on it...
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": Oh, well don't keep me waiting too long. The sooner I can get my tool fixed, the sooner I can carry on with my work.

## Talk 2

Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": These Iron Chunks should be just enough to fix my tool.
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": #I can't thank you enough. Here, these are for you, young {M#man}{F#lady}.
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": I just hope my skills haven't gotten too rusty now.
