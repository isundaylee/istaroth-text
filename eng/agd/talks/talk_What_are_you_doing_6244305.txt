Traveler: What are you doing?
Guan Hong: What am I doing? I'm enjoying life!
Guan Hong: I always thought that work was the most important thing. I slept little, ate little â€” got myself neither a wife nor kids!
Guan Hong: ...At least, that was until Dr. Baizhu told me I was a goner a little while back. That's when I figured it out! What work? What career? It's all hogwash!
Guan Hong: Good thing all the money I've saved in my earlier years is more than enough for me to wine and dine myself to death here at the Pearl Galley.
Guan Hong: ...Actually, when I put it like that, things aren't so bad! Hahaha!
