# After the Peace


## Talk 1

Paimon: Lately we've been sleeping well, and eating even better... now this is the life!
Traveler: About time we got to live like this.
Paimon: Exactly! Heehee, look, Paimon's tummy is so stuffed, it's all round and plump now...
Paimon: *yawn* —And now it's time for some rest! Mmm...
Traveler: (What a peaceful feeling... We're normally so busy, it's nice to have some downtime like this every once in a while between adventures.)
Citlali: We've got trouble!
Traveler: !?
Traveler: (That voice... is that Citlali?)
Traveler: To hear your voice at a time like this is truly an honor, Granny Itztli...
Citlali: Cut that out, it's serious! And what are you doing sleeping this late? Who are you, me?
Citlali: Come see us in the Speaker's Chamber once you've cleaned yourselves up. We're waiting for you here.
Traveler: (So much for sleeping in... Guess we'll have to head over there.)
Traveler: Wake up, Paimon, we've gotta go find Mavuika.
Paimon: Nooo, Paimon's not done eating yet... Huh? Oh... Good morning...
Black Screen Text: After explaining the situation to Paimon, you quickly wash up and head to the Speaker's Chamber...

## Talk 2

Citlali: I wonder if they've eaten... Or if they've even gotten up... Hmm, maybe I should buy some snacks?
Citlali: Oh, don't tell me something came up on their way here...
Mavuika: Relax. I'm sure they're fine.
Citlali: Ah, there they are!
Mavuika: See, just like I said.
Paimon: Mavuika, Citlali! We came running as soon as we got your message!
Mavuika: Thank you for coming all this way. Here, have some water and catch your breath first.
Traveler: Sounds like something major happened.
Mavuika: Well, you could certainly say that... I'll let Citlali explain.
Citlali: Ahem... Strictly speaking, I'm just passing on something I heard as well. Basically, the Wayob passed a truly shocking piece of news to me through the smoke last night.
Citlali: You're aware that Mavuika's not the first Pyro Archon, yes? On occasion, there were those who lived longer than an ordinary human, not unlike my situation. But, all in all, the title has changed hands many times.
Citlali: And now, the Wayob have sensed a special surge within the Ley Lines. A truly ancient soul is about to return to the mortal realm.
Citlali: His name... is Xbalanque.
Paimon: Xbalanque!? But isn't he... Isn't he the very very first...
Mavuika: Yes, that's him. The first Pyro Archon.
Mavuika: According to legend, he was the greatest of heroes and leaders, and the one who made a deal with the Ruler of Death, thereby creating the rules that saved Natlan's Ley Lines.
Paimon: Hasn't he been dead like, a really long time? How can he be resurrected?
Mavuika: Even in Natlan, it's impossible for someone as ancient as him to ever return... Still, nothing's off the table when Xbalanque's concerned.
Mavuika: Hence, why this really is "something major."
Citlali: Let me be clear about this: I did not mishear, nor is the Wayob mistaken! We would never jest about something like this.
Mavuika: #Don't worry, both Traveler and I have complete faith in your abilities. Whose interpretation of the Wayob's will could we trust, if not yours?
Citlali: Yeah, that's the one thing I'll never be modest about. But the fact I'm not wrong about this only further begs the question — just why is Lord Xbalanque suddenly about to be resurrected now?
Mavuika: As you can see, Citlali's even more concerned about this than I am.
Mavuika: Still, it's understandable. Waiting to find out the whole truth must be torture for a great shaman who can only peep at the outcomes without knowing the causes.
Citlali: Mavuika, I hope you'll approach this with a measure of caution. Depending on how things go, everything could change, or nothing at all... I think you know what I mean.
Mavuika: I do. Xbalanque's arrival will shake our nation. After all, we still don't know if he's satisfied with the outcome of this war.
Paimon: Wait, do you think he'll come and find you?
Citlali: Ah! You can't just up and say things like that, you scared me half to death!
Mavuika: That's actually pretty likely. Think about it, people in the same line of work tend to have some similarities, right? Maybe all Pyro Archons share my disposition.
Citlali: ...I don't want to meet him! I—I haven't really mentally prepared myself yet for such a... grand occasion!
Citlali: #Anyway, my job was just to pass on the message and bring Traveler over. Now that that's dealt with, you can discuss the Pilgrimage. I'm done here.
Paimon: Wait! Where are you going, Citlali?
Citlali: Back to bed! You have no idea how much that scared me — I was up all night... Ugh, I can barely keep my eyes open... Nighty night.
Traveler: Alright then, what's this about the Pilgrimage?
Mavuika: It's like I said before. Our cultural legacy shouldn't end with our triumph over our suffering. Instead, it will burn brighter than ever.
Mavuika: So, the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame has been given new meaning. We have chosen to turn it into a pure athletic competition, promoting fair play and encouraging the personal growth of contestants.
Mavuika: And... this grand tournament will begin soon.
Paimon: Woo! That sounds awesome!
Traveler: I'm itching to sign up!
Mavuika: Heroes are drawn to tournaments like this, and naturally, you're no exception.
Mavuika: The news of Lord Xbalanque's impending resurrection may be a bombshell, but I believe that we should keep our focus on the Pilgrimage.
Paimon: Huh, okay... So, not in a hurry to find him, huh?
Mavuika: That's right. I have already informed the tribes that we'll be hosting the next tournament right away. It'll help sweep away the shadows cast by the war.
Mavuika: Preparing supplies, cleaning up and remodeling the competition venues, recruiting staff for logistics, moral support, and pre-tournament weather forecasting... All of that's been assigned. We need to make sure everything is completed well and on schedule first.
Mavuika: #Traveler, Paimon. You are our cherished friends, and a part of our nation, and I would like to invite you to serve as special supervisors for this event.
Traveler: It would be my honor.
Paimon: P—Paimon can do it, too?
Mavuika: Of course. On that note, my two new supervisors, would you come with me to check on the progress of each of the tribes?
Paimon: Sure!
Traveler: When do I start?

## Talk 3

Paimon: We're here! This is our first stop.
Mavuika: Haha, looks like someone's in a good mood.
Paimon: Of course! Paimon's here as a special supervisor this time! Hehe, it's only been a few days, but Paimon's back and cooler than ever!
Traveler: I'm sorry, Paimon can be a lot...
Mavuika: Ah, it's nothing. We've got a long road ahead, so it's good that she's so motivated.
Mavuika: Pretty much all we need to do is talk to everyone and confirm how the preparations for the Pilgrimage are going.
Paimon: Hold a sec, take a look over there...
Paimon: See that? Someone's fishing... Ah, it's them!
Traveler: Ah, our iconic trio.
Ajaw: It's a quartet, you insolent ignoramuses, a quartet! How dare you treat the Almighty Dragonlord like a subhuman? If anything, I'm superhuman! ...Wait, no, draconian!
Mavuika: Why, hello there, Ajaw, and you three. What are you up to?
Kachina: We're fishing, Archon! Mualani says if we're lucky, we might catch someone really special!
Ajaw: Yeah, like that punk, Xbalanque. Pah! He's such a pathetic little— Gwargh!
Kinich: My apologies. Ajaw clearly hasn't earned his ticket to see the sun today. We didn't mean any offense — when Kachina and Mualani were talking about "fishing," they meant it literally, with hook and bait.
Ajaw: Lowly servant! How dare you beat up the Almighty Dragonlord for some ancient fogey that you only know by name! You'll pay for this... I'll start with some chili in your water skin...
Mavuika: Ah, so you've heard about his impending return. Did Citlali mention that to you?
Kinich: Mhm, we ran into her on the road not too long ago. She seemed to be falling asleep standing up, and kept mumbling about something...
Ajaw: "Oh no, oh no, why is Xbalanque coming back now? Did we screw something up? We couldn't have, right? But what else could have alarmed him so much..."
Paimon: Wow, that sounds just like her...
Kinich: And now that you're done, scram.
Ajaw: Wah!
Kachina: To be honest, it's been bothering me quite a lot... Under normal circumstances, it shouldn't be possible for us to meet Lord Xbalanque, right? So... does this mean something's wrong?
Kinich: As you can see, there are many people that are thinking along those same lines. I believe that...
Mualani: Hey! We've got a bite!
Drowning Man: Help! Help! Something's pulling on me!
Mualani: It's what's going to save your life! Are you having leg cramps?
Drowning Woman: I... *gurgle* *gurgle*...! Help... *gurgle*
Mualani: Hold your breath for now! We'll get you out right away!
Black Screen Text: With everyone's help, you manage to rescue the drowning people...
Drowning Man: Ugh... *coughing*
Drowning Woman: *cough* Thank you... so much, everyone... Wait, why is our Archon here... too... *cough*
Mavuika: Well, would you look at that... You actually caught some people after all.
Drowning Woman: Thanks for your help... Otherwise, that sudden bout of leg cramps might have ended our entire surfing squad.
Drowning Woman: The two of us are in charge of transporting supplies. After safely delivering some of the equipment, medicine, and a few other things for the tournament, we had some time to spare, so...
Mualani: Didn't warm up before going into the water, did ya?
Drowning Man: Thank you, thank you so much... We'll, um, leave you to it, then.
Drowning Woman: We'll never forget how you saved us! We know you're busy, though, so no need to worry about us — we'll see you around!
Paimon: Well, you gotta give it to Mualani, when she wants something to happen, then it just happens...
Mavuika: Then it won't be long before she reels in Xbalanque himself. Now that'll be a wonder of wonders...
Mualani: Hehehe, I was just thinking, what if he enjoyed swimming like the rest of us? It's easy enough for anyone who loves the water to end up here, so might as well give it a try. It'd be a great chance to say hi to him!
Mualani: I used some commemorative badges for the Stadium as a special bait. He's never been to present-day Natlan, so it'll all be new to him! I'm sure he'll be thrilled.
Kachina: And before you say anything — anything's possible! On the off chance this'll work, it's worth a try no matter how unlikely it is! Just like playing the lottery.
Kinich: As you can see, the power of friendship sustains their faith in the theory.
Mavuika: Well, what about you, then? Given your personality, isn't your continued presence a testament to the power of friendship, too?
Ajaw: Haha, she saw right through you, my foolish lackey! Silly, naive child... Now, witness the scorn of K'uhul Aja—owww!
Kinich: Picking up where we left off before... Citlali never makes mistakes with her messages, so I believe... that it would be best for you to meet with Lord Xbalanque. That should quell any unnecessary speculation.
Mavuika: Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.
Mavuika: But for now, what I need to do is check on the status of the preparations for the upcoming Pilgrimage.
Mavuika: ...Hmm, seems like the People of the Springs have done a great job.
Mualani: Yup, don't worry! We only came here to fish after finishing all of our work. We're all done, all three of us!
Kachina: Mhm! Everyone at the Children of Echoes has been hard at work too. I only came here after finishing my tasks for today. It looked like everyone else was about finished too.
Kinich: Same for the Scions of the Canopy. We're all wrapped up.
Mavuika: Now that's efficiency. I trust you. Well, looks like we won't have to make the trip to your tribes then.
Mavuika: Everyone, this iteration of the Pilgrimage holds great importance to Natlan as it is now. We must pull together and work as one, creating the best atmosphere possible for all our participants.
Ajaw: Uh-huh, suuure. Dunno why you'd worry about this stuff. You're always so ready to pounce on and fight just about anything — why, you even dare to disrespect the almighty Dragonlord!
Mavuika: Remind me again, has Ajaw done anything besides talk?
Kinich: I'll send the dirtiest jobs his way right this instant.
Ajaw: What are you doing to me, you son of a—!? Hey! Let me go!
Paimon: It's always a party with those three! Seems like we can check off the People of the Springs.
Paimon: Wait, four. Sorry, those four.
Traveler: I'm sorry, Paimon's letting this get to her head again...

## Talk 4

Paimon: Oh! There she is! Right over there!
Paimon: Citlali! Didn't you say you were going to get some more sleep? Why are you still here?
Citlali: *sigh* The Chief came to me for help just now. Not like I can just ignore someone in need and go back to bed, now can I?
Mavuika: You didn't tell him that you stayed up all night?
Citlali: I just told him about Xbalanque's imminent return, and told him to be prepared. There was no need to mention anything else.
Paimon: Right, you've still got a reputation to maintain, huh? Can't have people thinking Granny Itztli would lose sleep over something like this!
Citlali: Ugh, now you're making fun of me too, huh? Hmph, so even children are ridiculing me now. This cannot stand...
Citlali: And you! Do you also think I'm just trying to keep up appearances?
Traveler: Nope, not me, would never think that.
Citlali: And you too! What about you, Mavuika?
Mavuika: No, no, of course not.
Mavuika: Relax, Citlali.
Mavuika: Xbalanque was no ordinary person. He loved this land as much as we do, and managed to forge a miracle through the Ruler of Death. I don't think he'll give us too hard a time.
Traveler: Even though I've never known him...
Citlali: *sigh* If that's what even the two of you think, then my worrying seems even more unnecessary. Alright, alright, I get it. That's just the kind of paranoid old hag I am.
Citlali: That means I can go get some shut-eye, then? You can take a look around yourselves. And if you need any help, feel free to go find the Chief, or Ororon.
Citlali: The Chief should be overseeing the preparation of the woven scrolls required for the tournament right about now, and as for Ororon... I believe he said he was going to do some handicrafts at the valley entrance.
Mavuika: Haha, come on, you're making it sound like it's my first time here. Rest well, and stop worrying so much. We'll discuss the tournament with Ororon.
Citlali: Alright, then. Good night, everyone. And don't go thinking that Granny Itztli doesn't like hanging out with you just because she's not around all the time.
Traveler: I feel the same way.

## Talk 5

Ororon: Hmm, what if I put this piece of rope... here? Oh, and this wooden dummy...
Cacucu (???): Nuh-uh!
Ororon: No? Then what about this...
Cacucu (???): No way, bro!
Paimon: That voice... Sounds like Ororon's talking to someone. Let's go see what he's up to...
Paimon: Whatcha up to, Ororon?
Ororon: Oh, hello.
Cacucu (???): Oh dear! Oh dear!
Paimon: ...A bird?
Mavuika: No, a juvenile Qucusaurus. This one looks a little different from the others, though... Yeah, a very special look indeed.
Traveler: Is he your pet, Ororon?
Cacucu (???): The heck are you on about?
Paimon: Whoa, he's quick on his feet. That retort was instant...
Cacucu (???): For real, now? Do you even hear yourself, bro?
Paimon: H—Huh? Did Paimon just say something wrong?
Cacucu (???): Oh wow... No way, bro!
Paimon: Wh—What the heck!?
Ororon: Don't worry about him. He's just... Erm... How should I describe him...
Traveler: Don't tell me he's also some kind of elder...
Traveler: He definitely seems pretty important...
Ororon: No, he's an assistant at Ifa's clinic, and one of my friends. His name is Cacucu.
Cacucu: The heck are you on about?
Paimon: Huh? Is that not his name?
Cacucu: Oh wow... No way, bro!
Traveler: Seems like he's just repeating a few sentences over and over...
Ororon: Yeah, that's what he does. Those are all Ifa's catchphrases, so Cacucu picked them up after hearing them day after day.
Ororon: The last time I delivered some vegetables to the People of the Springs, I ran into Ajaw, who was there for a soak in the hot springs. Ajaw and Cacucu were stuck in an endless back-and-forth argument.
Traveler: Sounds like a schoolyard squabble...
Ororon: Eventually, Ajaw got really agitated, and just started immediately shouting "No, YOU!" no matter what Cacucu said!
Mavuika: How unbelievably childish... No less than I'd expect of Ajaw. Even I have rarely witnessed things like that.
Ororon: They went on like that for an entire afternoon.
Paimon: Wait, how do you know that? Did you stay and listen to them the whole time?
Ororon: Yeah, I did. It was so dumb, I couldn't look away.
Traveler: You're a more patient man than most...
Ororon: Anyway... I'm here because I'm trying to capture Xbalanque.
Mavuika: "Capture," huh? A... wild choice of words.
Ororon: Hmm... then how about, "hunting for Xbalanque"?
Paimon: Sorry, you're trying to do WHAT, now?
Ororon: We've never seen someone so ancient come back to life before, right? So I wanted to see if I could intercept him. See? This is the trap that I made.
Ororon: I've used it before. It's quite good at catching wild animals. Don't worry, though — I've already told everyone that there's a trap here, so they won't get too close.
Ororon: See? I even made a notice board.
Cacucu: Hahaha!
Paimon: Pff, good luck catching anyone with this... And what are you planning on doing with the poor guy when you catch him, anyway? Stick him in a stew?
Ororon: No, no, I just want to see what he looks like. And then... I'll probably invite him to our tribe as a guest.
Mavuika: I'll admit, I didn't take you for the actively hospitable sort.
Ororon: Well, a chance like this doesn't come every day. I wanted to give it a try, so I also made these little handicrafts.
Paimon: (Uhh... He says that, yet all of these look like a hunter's lethal handiwork...)
Mavuika: I see. In that case, I wish you success. If you do manage to catch a wild Xbalanque, please let me know. I'd love to come and watch the fun.
Paimon: Hey, not you too!
Mavuika: If the real Xbalanque does show up, a trap like that won't hurt him. We all have faith in him. After all, he was the first Archon of this land.
Ororon: That's right. That's also why I stuffed several layers of cushions and hay in there. If he really triggers the trap, he can just sprawl out and take a nap.
Cacucu: For real, now? Do you even hear yourself, bro?
Paimon: Bro, stop. You're driving Paimon insane over here...
Cacucu: Oh wow... No way, bro!
Traveler: No way, bro!
Paimon: Well, if you've got time for this, then you've finished prepping for the tournament, right?
Mavuika: You took the words right out of my mouth, Paimon.
Ororon: Ah, so that's it. Sorry, I didn't know that's what you wanted to ask about.
Ororon: We Masters of the Night-Wind are broadly responsible for the woven scrolls and mental support. I have expertise in exactly neither of those, so... I joined the logistics team.
Ororon: I provided some amazing supplies. The others even praised me for the quality of my produce, and even asked me about how to grow such great fruits and vegetables. I was very happy.
Mavuika: You've gotten quite good at dealing with people.
Ororon: Yes. I think I've rediscovered a bit of that feeling I had in my childhood.
Mavuika: Seems like things here are going smoothly. In that case, we'll check on how things are going elsewhere. See you later, Ororon.
Paimon: Bye, Ororon! Good luck with, uh... capturing Xbalanque...
Cacucu: See you later!
Mavuika: Oh, so he also knows how to say goodbye... See you later then, bros.
Ororon: Huh? Hmm... Alright. See you later, my bros.

## Talk 6

Xilonen: ...
Xilonen: Stop looking, I'm genuinely asleep now...

## Talk 7

Mavuika: Doesn't seem like there's anyone around... They're probably all out and about.
Paimon: Does that mean the preparations are going smoothly?
Mavuika: Of course, without a doubt. I'll be honest, I'm more concerned about how everyone's doing than how the preparations are coming along.
Mavuika: The amount of rest they get will directly impact their tournament performance. It's my hope that everyone is eating and sleeping well, so they can enter the Stadium full of anticipation.
Chasca: Hmm. What are you guys doing here?
Paimon: Oh, it's Chasca!
Chasca: It's been a while. How have you been?
Paimon: Great!
Mavuika: Things have been good on my end, too. How about you?
Chasca: Same old, same old. Back to the grind.
Chasca: Flying around to break up fights when they break out, taking walks with my family when I'm free... You know, the usual. That said, I haven't had much work to do lately.
Mavuika: I take it that means there haven't been many fights?
Chasca: Yeah, the war has just ended, and the bonds between people have grown a lot stronger in the process... Hard to start fights like that.
Chasca: I don't mind, though. More time for me to zone out. I just sit at a lookout point and tend to my weapons... The fresh air is also great for my mood.
Paimon: Sounds like you've been doing well, then!
Traveler: Glad to hear that.
Chasca: Haha, what are you talking about? You should know the ups and downs I've been through better than anyone.
Mavuika: So, how have preparations been going here at the Flower-Feather Clan?
Chasca: Ah, so that's why you're here. In that case, I'll take you someplace where you can see the situation clearly.
Chasca: Follow me.

## Talk 8

Mavuika: Hah. So this is the place you had in mind. Quite the view.
Chasca: Yeah.
Chasca: You can see our whole camp from up here. We trained like this back when we were fighting against the Abyss, too.
Paimon: You can see people talking and laughing, some holding boxes, others pushing carts... Even some who're using some kinda special equipment to scan the skies!
Flower-Feather Clan Tribesperson: Ah! It's you, Pyro Archon — and the heroes of Natlan, too!
Paimon: Aww, shucks. "Heroes of Natlan"? Paimon's feeling kinda shy now...
Flower-Feather Clan Tribesperson: What brings you to the Flower-Feather Clan? Are you here to check on our work for the Pilgrimage?
Mavuika: That's right. Everything going well?
Flower-Feather Clan Tribesperson: Please rest assured, everything's going off without a hitch. Everyone is in good spirits as well. Coach and her students are also here, so they've been helping out.
Paimon: Coach? Oh, is Iansan here too?
Iansan: Oho, here to inspect our handiwork, then?
Iansan: Lots of folks from the Flower-Feather Clan have gone to train for the tournament, and my students just so happened to want to get some exercise, so I brought them along to help.
Iansan: The rules of this tournament are different from before — we're here to compete, not to select the strongest warriors. Everyone finds that quite novel, and is taking it very seriously, treating it like a completely new type of challenge.
Iansan: Look, they're all over there.
Yopia (Flower-Feather Clan Tribespeople): Hey!
Yopia: Please rest completely and totally assured that with us here, we'll get all the tasks done on time, no problem and no questions asked.
Paimon: Whoa, they're all so reliable! Like Coach, like student, huh, Iansan?
Iansan: Haha, you flatter me. We're just here to help.
Iansan: These exercises are high-frequency but low-intensity, which is perfect for our training. I helped Ifa bring a whole stack of medical supplies from his clinic to the Stadium yesterday. Didn't even break a sweat, easy-peasy.
Paimon: Didn't even break a sweat, you say?
Iansan: Yeah. Ifa was sure sweating a lot, though. Not that I blame him — doctors don't need to be that physically strong, not even vets.
Mavuika: Especially not compared to the toughest coach in all Natlan.
Iansan: Tough, they say? Stuff like this isn't even intermediate level...
Chasca: And that's why they call you tough. I respect it, though. I doubt I can think of anything that you can't do.
Paimon: Paimon agrees! In fact, after staying in Natlan for so long, even we've begun to feel like there's nothing we can't do...
Chasca: So, you think it's something about this place?
Paimon: Yeah, exactly! Now, Paimon often finds herself thinking, "Eh, compared to those super tough battles we fought and won, this is nothing at all!"
Mavuika: I'm glad you feel that way. It's not often that people can focus on the silver lining after everything that's happened.
Iansan: Being optimistic also tends to make people grow happier the longer they live. Keep up that attitude, and you'll go from strength to strength.
Paimon: Mm-hmm!
Chasca: Hmm... The wind is rising. I think I hear something on the air.
Chasca: I'll head out on a patrol. Have a nice chat, and just let me know if you need anything.
Iansan: Sounds good. See you later!
Iansan: And she's off... She really comes and goes like the wind.
Mavuika: I'd say that it's effortlessly cool moments like this that make her so endearing.
Iansan: Well, what's next for you? You three look relaxed, so I assume you're pretty much done with all the important stuff?
Mavuika: We've already checked up on each of the tribes' progress. Everything is going smoothly.
Mavuika: We didn't quite get around to the Children of Echoes, but from what Kachina says, and seeing how Xilonen's doing, it seems they're fine. No need to check up on them.
Iansan: Don't worry, things have been progressing over at the Collective of Plenty too.
Mavuika: So, um... that's it for the day. The only thing left to do for the next couple of days is... persuade Xilonen to finish her part of the work.
Iansan: Haha, oh, I'd love to see the face she'd make if she heard you say that.
Iansan: Since you have time, why don't you give me a hand? As you already know, Mavuika, I'm responsible for designing the tournament course.
Iansan: Well, it's almost complete, and I've built a mock course. Want to do a trial run?
Paimon: Wait, so you mean... we can get a sneak peek at what the competition will be like!?
Iansan: Indeed. You know that Mavuika can't personally participate in the tournament, right? As the Archon, she must serve as both host and judge.
Iansan: And as special supervisors, you can't sign up, either. So, this is your best chance to experience the course!
Mavuika: Say no more, or my hair might spontaneously combust... Come on, just show us the course already.
Iansan: Alright, follow me.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Kinich: Everyone's been very efficient these past few days. Seems like lots of people are looking forward to participating in the tournament.
Ajaw: Hah! Why don't you sign up, then? Maybe someone'll manage to knock some sense through your thick skull!
Mualani: Why don't we all join? It'd be a great chance to kick back and relax!
Ajaw: Relax? You find the idea of a tournament relaxing!? This girl is crazy... Ugh...
Kachina: Mualani's right. Let's all sign up together!
Ajaw: Huh? Even you? Pah, children. Think you're all grown-up, don't you? In the eyes of the great K'uhul Ajaw, you're still...
Kinich: Nobody asked. We'll go, you stay.
Ajaw: What!? You little—!

### Additional Talk 2

Cacucu: Hey hey, hello there!
Traveler: Hello. You're Cacucu, right?
Cacucu: Oh! So you already know my name. That guy told you, didn't he? Ororon, right?
Cacucu: Hahaha, he spoke the truth. My name is indeed Cacucu, and I did pick those words up from hearing Ifa repeat them.
Cacucu: And have you met Ifa before?
Traveler: Not yet.
Cacucu: What, even with all his running around and being everywhere all at once all the time, you've never met him? Guess you must be in tip-top shape, so you've just never needed his services.
Cacucu: He's out to see some patients, and I had nothing to do, so I came to hang out with Ororon and watch him make his Xbalanque-trap. Absurd, right? He's so crazy, I love him.
Cacucu: Ifa. Ah, right, speaking of Ifa, I need to correct you on one thing.
Cacucu: Judging from how you reacted before... Did you think I couldn't really understand the human language?
Cacucu: C'mon, bro, of course that's not true! Hehe! As Saurians go, I already understand more than enough! And not just their words, no, but their body language, too.
Cacucu: There's a limit to how much I can mimic with my vocal cords — mighty shame, that — but I feel like my cadence should convey my meaning well enough.
Cacucu: So of course I understand what "No way, bro! Do you even hear yourself?" means — and all the rest of it too. I meant those words from the bottom of my heart.
Cacucu: Also, I'm no pet, I'm Ifa's colleague! Be a good bro, and call me Dr. Cacucu.
Traveler: You got it, Brocucu.
Cacucu: Hehehe, I like you! Chose the "bro" part over the "doc" part, eh? Well, if you'll be my bro, I'll gladly be yours too.
Cacucu: Ifa and Ororon are both my bros, and now, I've found a third bro. You look like a real fighter, too. Just what the doctor ordered.
Cacucu: Oh, and I guess Ajaw counts for like, half a bro. You know, that useless guy who works for Kinich from the Scions of the Canopy. Ahahaha, he's a funny one. Often chokes half to death on his anger after just a few words.
Traveler: He often calls himself the "Almighty Dragonlord"...
Cacucu: Hah! Sorry, what? "Almighty Dragonlord"? Bwahahahahahaha!
Cacucu: Bro, don't believe a single word he says. He's just an idiot. He'd have gotten himself killed long ago if Kinich wasn't looking out for him!
Cacucu: Still, don't you think that's what gives life its spice? No matter how much Ajaw whines, he can't leave Kinich. And Ifa can complain all he wants, but Ororon's still his friend.
Cacucu: Oh, and me, too. Ifa often says I'm too familiar with everyone — that I instantly fly off and tell all of my Saurian friends whenever he does something dumb. But that's just how we live, man. We torment and depend on each other in turns.
Cacucu: Once we Saurians know, the humans will know, too. And whatever humans know, the humans from further away will know real soon.
Cacucu: Still, I know you'll love Ifa, bro. He's a good guy, after all. Have you ever met a bad guy who's like, resigned all the time?
Cacucu: Anyway, if you ever need a doc, or just someone to help you translate our tongue, come find me anytime. I'll send my boy Ifa to go help right away.
Cacucu: Oh oops, I meant "my bro Ifa." Of course I'd slip up. He's not a boy, you hear? He's my bro.
Traveler: Next time, for sure.

### Additional Talk 3

Xilonen: Huh? Mavuika? Oh, shoot. What are you doing here...
Mavuika: Xilonen? What a coincidence.
Paimon: Oh, hey there, Xilonen! Did you come here for work?
Traveler: There's nothing around here, though...
Xilonen: Ororon... Did he sell me out? I thought I asked him to not tell anyone that I was here...
Paimon: Nope, he didn't mention you at all!
Xilonen: Tch... That so.
Mavuika: *sigh* she's avoiding me. There are a few big pieces of equipment we need for the tournament, and I've been wanting to ask her to make them.
Mavuika: I went straight to her place because I was worried she might refuse, but each time, there was nobody home, and the neighbors said that she was busy... turns out she was here.
Traveler: Xilonen's tent is nearby too...
Paimon: Wow, she literally ran away from home just to avoid taking work from you!
Xilonen: Hrmm...
Xilonen: Okay, that's enough about me... What are you here for? Checking on Pilgrimage prep progress?
Mavuika: Yes, and to see how everyone's doing while we're at it. Still, most everyone we've talked to so far has been pretty interested in Xbalanque.
Xilonen: Xbalanque? Did you just say Xbalanque?
Paimon: Wait, have you been so busy running away that you missed the whole memo about him?
Black Screen Text: You explain Xbalanque's imminent resurrection to Xilonen...
Xilonen: I'm still trying to wrap my head around it... But if that's what Citlali said, then it has to be true.
Xilonen: Everyone's reactions make sense, too. Who wouldn't want to see the first Archon?
Mavuika: This isn't a bad time for it to happen, either. The war has only just ended, and with their long-standing goal suddenly gone, people are feeling a little lost.
Mavuika: I met a warrior from the People of the Springs near the Speaker's Chamber a few days ago. He spent the entire afternoon pacing around the area.
Mavuika: I asked him if anything was bothering him, and he said that he used to train for battle every afternoon. But now that the crisis is resolved, he doesn't know what to do with himself.
Paimon: Hmm, Paimon can definitely see that... It's tough when what you've been doing all along suddenly stops being necessary.
Paimon: That's why you want to hold the Pilgrimage again, right? To help everyone find a new goal.
Mavuika: That's right. We will have competition take the place of ceaseless battle. It will give us an outlet for our pent-up energy, and offer a reward for the blood and sweat we've put into improving and growing.
Mavuika: That's the meaning of the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame today and in the future.
Xilonen: Sounds pretty good to me. I am starting to like this new Pilgrimage already.
Xilonen: But how do you feel, Mavuika?
Mavuika: About Xbalanque, you mean? Meh, it's okay, I guess.
Xilonen: Shouldn't you be, you know, a little more nervous? He's our nation's progenitor. You sure he's not coming just to supervise your work?
Mavuika: Ah, you sound like someone who's finally gotten the chance to strike back after years of oppression.
Xilonen: Hey, don't put it like that... Alright, maybe a little. It's not every day that someone who could bring you down a notch shows up.
Mavuika: Hahaha, I knew that's what you'd think. Don't worry. If the real Xbalanque does make an appearance, then naturally, I have my ways to meet him.
Paimon: Really? How?
Mavuika: No spoilers just yet. Take a guess.
Paimon: Wait, you have a playful side, too?
Xilonen: Of course she does. This whole "glorious, righteous leader" thing is just one facet of her, and it's the side of her you've seen the most so far. But...
Mavuika: Tragically, this is how my long-time companions think of me. Xilonen's always saying how awful I am.
Xilonen: Hey, hey! Don't just put words into my mouth like that. I've only ever said that you can be quite terrible "sometimes."
Mavuika: #Sure, sure, whatever you say. Come on, Traveler, Paimon, let's head to our next stop.
Mavuika: Oh, and Xilonen, now that you've been busted, be sure to stop by my office and pick up the documents I left for you. I wrote down everything you need to do for the tournament.
Xilonen: Good night! *snores*
Paimon: Aaaaaand she's "fallen asleep," just like that...
Mavuika: Well, she's got to wake up eventually. Let's go. Good night, Xilonen, and sleep well.
Traveler: Other than Ororon and his trap, I mean...

### Additional Talk 4

Ororon: What is it? Do you want to talk about something else?
Ororon: Hmm, you've got to find someone who understands Saurian-tongue to translate for you, then.
Cacucu: No way, bro!
Ororon: Or... transform into a Saurian so they can talk to you. On that note, I'd love to try that one day, bro.
