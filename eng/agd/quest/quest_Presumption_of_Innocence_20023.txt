# Presumption of Innocence


## Talk 1

Victoria: I wonder if he will finally repent this time...
Traveler: Repent from what?
Victoria: Lots of people come here every day to confess their sins and seek forgiveness from the gods.
Victoria: But if you only say it and don't act on it, don't you think that's a waste of time?
Victoria: Take Nimrod for instance. He has come here to confess his alcohol abuse numerous times, but he hasn't changed one bit...
Victoria: If you have time, maybe you could go and check up on him?
Traveler: Okay.
Victoria: Oh — and if he is drinking again, please bring some evidence back.
Victoria: Sometimes, serial offenders need a little instruction to help them correct the error of their ways...
Traveler: Is drinking a sin, then?
Victoria: Drinking alone is not a sin. But it is sinful to drink to the point that you bring undue distress to others.
Victoria: If everyone was to behave quite so unscrupulously, sooner or later the entirety of Mondstadt would find itself in a very distressing situation.
Victoria: So each time a sin rears its ugly head, it needs to be nipped in the bud. Now, quickly, go check up on Nimrod for me.

## Talk 2

Nimrod: Hahaha, this is the one I look forward to every day...
Traveler: I thought you quit drinking?
Nimrod: Argh! Oh, you gave me a fright... I thought it was my wife.
Nimrod: The odd one now and then doesn't hurt anybody! I did have a tough day's work today...
Nimrod: Alright, I get it! I'll finish off this one and head back. Eury will probably have finished shopping by now anyway.

## Talk 3

Charles: Hello? Can I help?
Traveler: Tell me about Nimrod.
Charles: He's been here drinking for hours. Look, here's his tab.
Charles: If he keeps this up, we'll have to call in Eury.
Charles: You want to borrow it? I suppose there's no harm in that — but what do you need it for?

## Talk 4

Victoria: Have you checked up on him yet?
Traveler: This is Nimrod's bill from the tavern.
Victoria: Hmph. Just as I thought, he's at it again.
Victoria: People will forget everything that's happened in their past unless they've really had to suffer for it...
Victoria: Please take this as payment for your trouble.
Victoria: As for Nimrod's payback... I will mull it over.

## Talk 5

Victoria: People don't tend to learn the lessons that their past can teach them unless... Unless somebody points it out to them directly.

## Talk 6

Victoria: People don't tend to learn the lessons that their past can teach them unless... Unless somebody points it out to them directly.

## Talk 7

Quinn: I've had no end of customers again today, I'm beat...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Victoria: Have you checked up on him yet?
Traveler: Nimrod is sober as a judge.
Victoria: ...Really? He's sober?
Traveler: Unfortunately there's no evidence...
Victoria: That's okay. So long as you found no evidence of him drinking, I am content to believe he is a changed man.
Victoria: Until I am given evidence to the contrary, I am always willing to believe in a person's innocence.
Victoria: But when there's mountains of evidence telling of all kinds of misdemeanors... It really is funny.
Victoria: Please take this to pay you back for your trouble. I hope I don't see the day that you have anything to repent for.
