Yanfei: If you think about it, you could define a "challenge" as a process that's difficult to get control over due to a lack of key information. Right?
Yanfei: Example: What foes are we likely to encounter when exploring this domain? How many hostile encounters are likely to occur? And what available countermeasures can we use?
Yanfei: Take the time to thoroughly consider all these questions. Then you'll find that reaching your goal is no longer a "challenge" at all.
