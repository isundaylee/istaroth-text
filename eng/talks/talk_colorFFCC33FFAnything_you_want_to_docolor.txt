Kamisato Ayaka: Hm... Would you like to exchange views on the art of tea-making?
Kamisato Ayaka: In other words... Do you want to try my home-made matcha?
Kamisato Ayaka: I have read in a book before that Mondstadt and Liyue each have their own, unique tea cultures.

Kamisato Ayaka: I'd like you to try some authentic Inazuma Matcha and tell me what you think!
Kamisato Ayaka: ...Perhaps your feedback will also deepen my understanding of the tea ceremony.
Traveler: I'm pretty sure that someone of your status shouldn't be making tea for me.

Kamisato Ayaka: The title of "the daughter of the Kamisato Clan" and involvement in the Yashiro Commission pales in comparison to the depths of your experiences.

Traveler: Let me make some desserts to go along with the tea.
Kamisato Ayaka: ...Really?!
Kamisato Ayaka: Ahem... Please excuse my lack of manners. It is because I'm excited.
Kamisato Ayaka: Being able to enjoy tea with my closest confidant â€” it feels like I'm in a dream...
