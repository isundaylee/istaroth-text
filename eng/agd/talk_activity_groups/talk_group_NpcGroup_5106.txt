Traveler: What sort of end are we talking about?
Corneille: I mean the end of a play, of course!

Traveler: That doesn't sound like a very rigorous distinction to me.
Corneille: But does it matter, really? A criminal is a criminal — someone who's done wrong. Any case involving them is sure to become a talking point regardless.

Corneille: Besides, watching trials is a way of studying the law as well.
