# Roll! A Sea of New Acquaintances


## Talk 1

Paimon: Wow, Liyue Harbor is still bustling as always.
Charlotte: "Where merchants flock and all ships dock"... Now I understand what that saying was trying to describe. Still, nothing beats seeing it with your own eyes!
Baiwen: Welcome to Liyue Harbor. I hope you had a smooth journey? Lady Ningguang instructed me to wait for you here.
Paimon: Hmm? Oh, it's Ningguang's secretary! Bai... uh, which Bai is it again?
Baiwen: It's Baiwen. I assist Lady Ningguang with collecting and organizing intelligence.
Paimon: That's right, Baiwen! Paimon remembers now. The other two are Baishi and Baixiao.
Charlotte: Lady Ningguang? You mean Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing?
Paimon: Yep, that's her. But why does Ningguang want to see us? Wait, and how did she even know that we'd be arriving in Liyue Harbor today!?
Baiwen: Lady Ningguang likes to stay informed. Nothing slips through her intelligence network.
Baiwen: She wishes to invite our visitor from Fontaine, Mademoiselle Charlotte, to join her at Yujing Terrace to discuss cooperation.
Charlotte: Hmm? What would she want with me? This is the first time I've ever been to Liyue Harbor.
Baiwen: Lady Ningguang has known of you for quite some time: a talented and capable journalist with The Steambird who writes insightful, engaging, and — most importantly — factual prose. She rather admires your work.
Baiwen: She also understands that in revealing the truth through your exclusive news, you have offended some interested parties that have been pulling strings behind the scenes — and that is why you have been sent on an international reporting trip to cover the Genius Invokation TCG events.
Paimon: Wait, what? That's terrible... Poor Charlotte.
Charlotte: No, no, it's just part of the job. I'm already used to it.
Charlotte: But I'm surprised to learn that Lady Ningguang knows so much about my situation. Does she know my boss or something?
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon wouldn't be surprised. She seems to know everyone and everything.
Baiwen: Lady Ningguang also welcomes the two of you to join, if you're interested.
Charlotte: Oh? You didn't tell me you were best buddies with Lady Ningguang...
Paimon: Oh, Paimon wouldn't go THAT far... We've just been invited to the Jade Chamber as honored guests a couple of times, y'know...
Traveler: Enough with the humble-bragging, Paimon...
Paimon: Uh, but anyway... if Ningguang wants to discuss work stuff with Charlotte, it's probably gonna be best if we stay out of the way, right?
Paimon: Maybe we can go ask around about the Card Snatcher while you have your meeting with Ningguang.
Charlotte: Oh, are you sure?
Traveler: Absolutely. No trouble at all.
Charlotte: Alright, thanks! Then I'll leave you to it. Let's catch up and swap notes later? I'm actually pretty excited to meet Lady Ningguang, so I don't want to keep her waiting...
Baiwen: Very well. Please, Mademoiselle Charlotte, follow me.
Charlotte: See you two later.
Paimon: Sounds like Charlotte's a top-notch journalist, huh. Paimon's not sure what that "exclusive" news is all about... but it definitely sounds like a big deal.
Paimon: And if she manages to write up an article about this Card Snatcher case, we'll be featured in her exclusive news, too!
Paimon: Ohh, it feels like we're about to become famous!
Traveler: ...We're already famous.
Paimon: Yep, you're right. Okay, why don't we start asking around at the docks? There's always a lot of people coming and going — maybe someone's seen people trading cards there.
Traveler: Let's just focus on the task at hand.
Traveler: While we're at it, we can check out our old haunts.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hi there! We'd like to ask you about something.
Guanhai: Hmm? Oh, sure, ask away. The ship's already set sail anyway, so I've got all the time in the world...
Paimon: Have you seen anyone around here recently collecting card backs? You know, for that really popular game, Genius Invokation TCG?
Guanhai: Collecting card backs? Hmm... I've definitely seen people around here playing the game, but... I'm usually preoccupied with thinking about the sea, I've never paid too much attention to it...
Paimon: ...It's fine, we'll ask someone else.
Guanhai: Ugh... I really can't afford to wake up late next time...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Hi there, can we ask you a question?
Yong'an: Sure, go ahead. I'll a—a—ATCHOO! Answer as best I can.
Paimon: Have you noticed anyone here collecting card backs for Genius Invokation TCG recently?
Yong'an: Card backs? ATCHOO! No, I'm afraid not.
Yong'an: Sorry, just before, a... ATCHOO! A girl in Inazuman attire walked by and I've... ATCHOO! Been sneezing non-stop since.
Paimon: Well, take care of yourself, and get well soon... We'll keep asking around.
Yong'an: I'll be alright. While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never... ATCHOO! ...Prevail.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Hey there. Got a question for ya.
Uncle Sun: Ah hello, ask away! If it's fish you want, I've got all the answers!
Paimon: Uh, actually it's not about fish. We were just wondering, since you're here all day running your stall, have you seen anyone collecting card backs for Genius Invokation TCG?
Uncle Sun: Genius Invokation TCG? Hmm, 'fraid I don't know anything 'bout that. People come here for Black-Back Bass, but not card backs.
Paimon: Really? Sorry to bother you, then. We'll try our luck somewhere else.
Uncle Sun: Don't you wanna buy some fish to take with you? All my fish are "super fresh," you know.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Well, this got off to a slow start. Let's try somewhere else.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hey, you two. Looking for someone?
Paimon: Huh? Paimon knows that voice... it's Kazuha!
Kaedehara Kazuha: #Nice to see you again, {NICKNAME} and Paimon.
Traveler: It's been too long.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Captain Beidou needed to return to Liyue to take care of some business, so I've been taking the chance to get to walk around town. It's a nice surprise to run into you two here.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Looks like you have questions. May I be of any help?
Paimon: Well, long story short...
Black Screen Text: Paimon tells Kazuha all that's happened recently...
Kaedehara Kazuha: I see... Well, the harbor breeze is as peaceful and pleasant and as ever. I don't believe that the Card Snatcher you're looking for has been through here.
Paimon: Huh, okay...
Kaedehara Kazuha: I'm not sure if that's good news or bad in your eyes. Oh, by the way, it seems there's a competition being held nearby. I stopped to have a look. This "Genius Invokation TCG"... It seems to be immensely popular at the moment.
Paimon: Wait... Have you never played it before, Kazuha?
Kaedehara Kazuha: No, I haven't. I have quietly observed from the side.
Kaedehara Kazuha: The Captain brought a small box aboard recently that contained a variety of beautifully illustrated cards. She enjoys playing with the crew, while enjoying a few drinks... a few too many, perhaps.
Paimon: That's called a Casket of Tomes. It's what you use to carry your cards in, and it helps you find players nearby, too!
Paimon: You should give it a try, Kazuha! The rules are pretty easy to pick up, and then you'll have a fun game to play with your friends.
Traveler: This is the perfect chance to learn.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm, forging friendship through card-based combat does sound quite delightful. Alright then, show me the ropes, if you please.
Paimon: #Paimon can teach you! Paimon's watched {NICKNAME} play a ton of times, so even Paimon's a master invokator now!
Paimon: After we teach you the rules, we'll also have to get you a Casket of Tomes.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But what about this Card Snatcher you're looking for? Is not dealing with that more urgent at present?
Paimon: Oh, good point... Hehe, Paimon got so caught up chatting with our old friend that she nearly forgot about our promise to our new friend.
Paimon: Hmm... Now, where should we go next...
Paimon: Huh? Hey, look over there.
Paimon: Isn't that the Inazuman courier who Diona was chatting with back in Mondstadt? What's she doing here?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Ah, I just noticed the logo at her waist. Isn't that Komaniya Express?
Paimon: Huh? Do you know that company, Kazuha?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, I've heard of it. They provide delivery services in Inazuma.
Paimon: Hmm... Looks like she's having some trouble. Why don't we go and introduce ourselves?
Traveler: How've you been?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Very well, thank you. Even better now that you're here.

## Talk 6

Kirara: Hmm, which way is it from here...?
Paimon: Hey there! You look lost, need any help?
Kirara: Meow! You frightened the life out of me... Huh? Oh, I recognize you... Weren't you at The Cat's Tail in Mondstadt?
Paimon: #Yep! Paimon's name is Paimon, and these two are {NICKNAME} and Kaedehara Kazuha. It's a strange coincidence running into you again!
Kirara: Hello, hello... My name's Kirara. I'm a courier for Inazuma's Komaniya Express.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I know Komaniya Express is widely praised for its punctual and safe delivery services. But I wasn't aware that the company had started operating internationally.
Kirara: Wow, it's rare to meet a fellow Inazuman abroad!
Kirara: Our company just recently began expanding its services overseas... which is great for me, because now I basically get paid to travel all around the world! Only downside is, I sometimes get a bit lost when it's my first time in a new city...
Kirara: Sometimes when I'm running late, I even have to change back into my original form and climb over walls to make sure the parcel's on time.
Kirara: Uh... Do you happen to know the way to the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor? I feel like I've been going in circles all day.
Paimon: Yeah, we know the place. We'll show you the way.
Kirara: You will? Oh, thank you so much!

## Talk 7

Hu Tao: "Down on the ground the dice spin around, while high in the sky the sun shines bright"... Hmm, that last line could use some work...
Paimon: Here we are! This is it.
Hu Tao: #Oh, why it's {NICKNAME} and Paimon! What brings you here?
Hu Tao: And I see you've brought some... friends? Clients? Business partners? New associates?
Paimon: Ahem... Maybe leave the introductions to Paimon. This is Kaedehara Kazuha, and this is Kirara.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hello, it's an honor to meet you.
Hu Tao: Greetings, old friends and new. So, what brings you all to Wangsheng Funeral Parlor this fine day?
Hu Tao: Wait! Don't tell me — is it our latest promotion? I'm touched that you journeyed all this way...
Paimon: No, no, we were just giving Kirara directions.
Kirara: Hello, Ma'am. Are you Director Hu Tao of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor? I'm your Komaniya Express courier, and we have a delivery for you — I just need to ask you for a signature.
Hu Tao: Let me see... Ah yes, I've been expecting this.
Hu Tao: Delivery services these days make everything so much easier... I used to have to send my consultant running to and fro for this kind of thing.
Hu Tao: Say, Kirara, how flexible is your company in terms of delivering different types of goods? How about a living person? And what about someone who's more in-between alive and dead?
Kirara: Huh!? Uh...
Paimon: Her tails are standing up on end...
Hu Tao: Guess that's a no... Well, maybe we can talk about potentially expanding your company's services sometime.
Kirara: C—Could I trouble you to take a moment and leave a five-star review?
Hu Tao: Five stars? That's an odd number... Let's make it an even six! No, much too low — service this good deserves at least eight! In fact, nine: one extra for going the extra mile!
Kirara: Oh, five stars will be plenty, really... But your enthusiasm means a lot!
Kirara: Alright, I should be on my way now. Thanks again for the directions.
Traveler: You're welcome.
Paimon: Yeah! Don't mention it.
Kirara: Cool! Well, I look forward to seeing you all again soon. Although... hopefully next time it won't be because I'm lost...
Kaedehara Kazuha: I heard you reciting a poem just now, Director Hu. May I ask from where you drew your inspiration?
Hu Tao: Oh? Do you share a liking for poetry as well?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Once in a while, I throw words at each other and see what sticks.
Hu Tao: Aiya, there's no need for self-deprecation. I've seen people from all walks of life, and I can tell just from the way your sleeves flutter in the wind that you're a man of culture.
Hu Tao: Anyway — I'm preparing for the tournament final that will be held shortly. Anyone feeling poetic? I need ideas.
Paimon: Tournament final? You mean the Genius Invokation TCG tournament?
Hu Tao: Yeah, that's the one!
Hu Tao: My next opponent is no small fry. Most of the time he's so unassuming, you couldn't pick him out of a crowd. But during this tournament, it's like he sprang up outta the ground like a Whopperflower and took the competition completely by surprise.
Hu Tao: So I have a strong feeling that this will be a tough battle to win.
Paimon: Then shouldn't you be focusing on your strategy? How is writing poetry gonna help...
Hu Tao: Because skill doesn't thrill unless you've also got style!
Paimon: What?
Hu Tao: Lemme give you an example you'd be more familiar with... To make a great dish, it takes not just flavor, but presentation too. Ever heard the saying, "It takes two flints to light a fire"? Same principle applies when you're trying to make an impression.
Paimon: Hmm, that sounds like it makes sense... Or does it? Paimon can never tell with Hu Tao...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm... In duels to the death, some samurai pay each other respects before the fight. Often, the two opponents find they have much in common.
Hu Tao: See, new guy gets it! What did I say — a man of culture!
Kaedehara Kazuha: You flatter me, Director Hu. In my humble opinion, you could try incorporating your competitive aspirations into your lines. Or perhaps some words to intimidate your opponent.
Hu Tao: Oh, we have an expert among us! Hey, why don't you play a match with me? It'll help me warm up, and maybe find some creative inspiration.
Kaedehara Kazuha: As much as I'd like to oblige, I'm afraid that I haven't played before. I don't even have my own deck.
Traveler: You can use my deck.
Paimon: Perfect! Paimon really wants to watch you play. How about Paimon gives Kazuha a crash course right now?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Since everyone is so willing to offer their help, how can I refuse?
Black Screen Text: Paimon explains the rules of Genius Invokation TCG to Kazuha...
Paimon: #So there you have it, those are the rules! Paimon also included a few little tips and tricks she's picked up from watching {NICKNAME} play. Well? Think you can handle it from here, Kazuha?
Kaedehara Kazuha: I think I've got it. Thank you, Paimon Sensei.
Paimon: S—Sensei? Hehe, wow...! Paimon's never been called that before!
Hu Tao: Well, Kazuha? Ready to go one-on-one against Liyue's most notorious backstreet poet?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, thank you for the opportunity, Director Hu.
Hu Tao: Any last words before the duel begins?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Umm... one moment... Okay, I think I've got something.
Paimon: Wow... that was fast.
Hu Tao: Alright! Say your piece, challenger!
Paimon: Whoa, things are really heating up!
Traveler: Shh!
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...
Kaedehara Kazuha: "Minds like sharp blades clash, friendship forged through cards and dice, autumn leaves burn bright." I, Kaedehara Kazuha humbly accept this duel.
Hu Tao: Hehe... "The birds are chirping, the weather's so nice, watch me roll six Pyro dice!" Director Hu of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is ready for battle!
Traveler: Bit of a jarring change of genre there...
Paimon: Hehe...
Hu Tao: My turn! Chi~!
Black Screen Text: Hu Tao and Kazuha play a thrilling match of Genius Invokation TCG...
Traveler: Do you handle all of the deliveries?
Kirara: No... Not necessarily. Business has been picking up lately, so the company has hired lots of new staff. But I handle all the international deliveries, because I'm the quickest — I am a youkai, after all.
Paimon: So chances are that we'll see you on the road again soon.

## Talk 8

Little Fang: *sobbing*...
Chongyun: Hey, don't panic! I'm sure we'll find her.
Paimon: Chongyun! We found you!
Chongyun: #Paimon? {NICKNAME}? And...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hello, I am Kaedehara Kazuha.
Chongyun: Hi, I'm Chongyun, an exorcist from Liyue. Long story short, this boy lost his friend while they were playing Hide-and-Seek.
Little Fang: *sobbing* ...I told Little Yu not to hide anywhere too far away... But I've looked everywhere, and I still can't find her.
Paimon: Uh-oh, it can be dangerous to get lost out here in the wilderness! We'll help look for her, too. Did you see which direction she went?
Little Fang: Yeah... I kinda peeked a little bit when I was counting, she went that way...
Paimon: Okay, then let's start looking in that direction.

## Talk 9

Kaedehara Kazuha: Ah, I am defeated. It's no wonder that Director Hu has earned a spot in the tournament finals.
Paimon: Talk about an exciting match, though!
Hu Tao: Good thing I was able to "Send Off" of all those Summons of yours.
Hu Tao: I have to say, it's hard to believe that this was your first time playing!
Kaedehara Kazuha: I owe it all to Paimon Sensei's teaching.
Paimon: Huh? You really mean that? Yay, hehe!
Traveler: I agree. Paimon Sensei is the best teacher.
Paimon: Aww shucks, now Paimon's embarrassed, hehe...
Paimon: Well, Kazuha, did you enjoy Genius Invokation TCG?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes indeed, there is a good variety of card abilities, and the tempo of the match can swing in an instant. I understand now why it's become so popular all across Teyvat.
Keqing: Oh, seems the world's gained yet another TCG player.
Paimon: Keqing! When did you get here?
Keqing: Shortly after these two had begun their match. Everyone seemed so focused on the game that I didn't want to interrupt.
Keqing: You must be Kaedehara Kazuha? Your reputation precedes you. It's an honor to finally meet you.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Please, the honor is all mine. I have heard great things about the esteemed Yuheng from Captain Beidou.
Keqing: Just call me Keqing. You played very well indeed, considering it was your first time. I'm impressed.
Keqing: If we ever have the opportunity, I too would like to play a match with you.
Paimon: Wow, Kazuha's already lined up his next opponent!
Keqing: Why so surprised? Practically everyone at Yujing Terrace is playing Genius Invokation TCG these days. I also play from time to time, when time permits.
Kaedehara Kazuha: #It would be my pleasure to join you for a match. However, I can't borrow {NICKNAME}'s deck forever. Our match might have to wait until after I manage to obtain my own Casket of Tomes.
Keqing: Oh, that shouldn't be a problem. When we get back to the tournament venue, I'll ask a member of the Genius Invokation TCG Society to provide one for you.
Keqing: #And please don't think about returning the favor — I assure you, it's no inconvenience. Besides, a friend of {NICKNAME} is a friend of us all.
Traveler: Thanks, Keqing.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I am grateful for your kindness, Keqing.
Keqing: Pleasure. Also, Hu Tao, the final is about to start. I just came to make sure you're aware.
Hu Tao: Don't worry, it might look like my mind's on other things, but I'm still listening!
Hu Tao: Thorough preparation is the key to victory, after all!
Keqing: Will you all be coming with us to the venue?
Traveler: Actually, there's something we wanted to discuss first...
Paimon: Ah, right! Back to the task at hand...
Paimon: We're investigating a Card Snatcher. Have any of you seen someone going around collecting Genius Invokation card backs recently?
Hu Tao: Card backs? You mean like the kind with a treasure chest design on it?
Paimon: Yes, exactly! That's the one!
Hu Tao: Funny, the word "snatcher" didn't come to mind when I saw him... He struck me as more of a... potential client.
Hu Tao: I saw him playing a match against Chongyun this morning. He said that whoever lost would have to hand over their card back. It was close, but he managed to beat Chongyun in the end. After the match, he wiped the sweat from his forehead, took the card back from Chongyun, and left.
Paimon: Sounds like we need to go talk to Chongyun, then.
Hu Tao: In that case, try Wuwang Hill. I think that's where he should be.
Keqing: If I may ask, what else has this alleged "Card Snatcher" suspected of doing?
Paimon: Umm... We don't know too much about him, apart from his obsession with Card Backs. But apparently, he's stolen other players' cards before!
Keqing: I see. I'll inform the Millelith to be on the lookout for this individual, but while he's still at large, make sure you stay safe.
Kaedehara Kazuha: #I think I'll go with {NICKNAME} to Wuwang Hill.
Keqing: Alright. See you later.
Traveler: Good luck in the final, Director.
Hu Tao: With so many people rooting for me, I'm sure the match will be over before I can say "hyu!"
Paimon: Alright, let's go find Chongyun.
Traveler: And so begins Kazuha's TCG journey.
Traveler: Look, Paimon Sensei's ego is so inflated, she's floating.
Paimon: Hey, Paimon's always been able to float in the air!

## Talk 10

Paimon: Seriously, why are we always running into these guys?
Chongyun: Hey everyone, have a look at this.
Paimon: Are those Genius Invokation cards?
Little Fang: Oh! I know that one, it belongs to Little Yu!
Little Fang: Her dad gave her a deck, and it's her favorite thing. She takes it with her everywhere.
Paimon: So Little Yu was definitely here... But there's a fork in the road up ahead. Which way should we go?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm, wait a moment... Did Little Yu's father also give her a small box to store the cards?
Little Fang: Yeah, a Casket of Tomes. I have one, too.
Chongyun: Oh! Of course! Why didn't I think of that?
Traveler: Right, it can locate nearby players!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes. As long as she still has the box with her, we should be able to determine her location.
Paimon: Quick, get our Casket of Tomes out!
Paimon: Let's see... there's Chongyun and Little Fang... Aha! There's another player over there, that must be Little Yu!

## Talk 11

Little Fang: Little Yu!
Little Yu: Little Fang? *sob* I'm sorry, I shouldn't have gone so far away...
Little Yu: I was trying to find a hiding place, but then I saw a bunch of really angry-looking guys and I got scared... So I ran and ran till I ended up here. *sob*
Chongyun: Don't worry, we've already taken care of the bad guys.
Chongyun: But Wuwang Hill is full of yin energy. You shouldn't be playing in a place like this, understand?
Little Fang: Yes Sir, we won't do it again. Thanks, everyone.
Little Yu: Thank you for rescuing me...
Chongyun: Of course. Now, don't go running off. Hang tight for a moment, and I'll walk you both home.
Paimon: Whew... Paimon's glad she was okay.
Chongyun: Me too. Good on Kazuha for coming up with the Casket of Tomes idea.
Paimon: Yeah, how did the rest of us not think of that? Guess we use it so often when we're playing cards that it didn't occur to us to use it for anything else.
Paimon: What a nifty little gadget. The Sumeru scholars who invented it must be super brainy...
Paimon: Oh, by the way Chongyun, we wanted to ask you about something...
Black Screen Text: Paimon describes the Card Snatcher situation to Chongyun...
Chongyun: Ugh, I knew there was something fishy about his obsession with card backs! I can't believe it... I let a thief slip right through my fingers! Whew, deep breaths... stay calm...
Kaedehara Kazuha: It's not your fault. You didn't know what his intentions were.
Kaedehara Kazuha: If I'd been in your shoes, and he invited me to a duel on the same terms, I doubt I'd have sensed anything untoward either.
Paimon: Exactly. He's crafty. If you're not paying attention, he'll just steal the card he wants, and if that doesn't work, he'll come up with some other way to get his hands on it.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Did he happen to say anything after he got the card back?
Chongyun: Not a lot. He seemed to be in a hurry — he just packed up his things and then left for the docks. Hmm... but I did hear him grumbling about how far away Inazuma is, and how he wasn't looking forward to the boat journey.
Paimon: This guy sure talks to himself a lot...
Paimon: Well, it sounds like a pretty solid lead, so Paimon thinks we should follow it. But first, we should stop by the venue.
Chongyun: Then I guess I'll take Little Fang and Little Yu home now. Though I'd really rather help track down that thief...
Traveler: Don't worry, leave the Card Snatcher to us.
Chongyun: Sure. I'm counting on you.
Paimon: Whoa, is it just Paimon, or did things suddenly get gloomier here after Chongyun left? Come on, let's get outta here.
Traveler: You okay? Try not to let it get to you.
Chongyun: Yeah, you're right... When I get back, I should probably meditate for a while to calm myself down. Thanks for your concern.

## Talk 12

Keqing: What an incredible match. Truly mesmerizing to watch two players compete at such a high level.
Paimon: What? We missed the final again? Ugh, Paimon was hoping we'd at least get to catch a glimpse of the final round.
Keqing: Ah, you're back. Did you find Chongyun? Everything go smoothly?
Paimon: There were a few hiccups along the way, but in the end, it all turned out fine! So, Hu Tao, did you win your match?
Hu Tao: Of course! It didn't go quite as "hyu" as I'd expected, but all in all, it was still a good old "wham, bam, I'd like to thank my fam."
Hu Tao: My opponent was no pushover. We both took out a couple of each other's character cards before it came down to the decisive round.
Hu Tao: I closed my eyes, held my breath, and clenched the dice tightly in my hand as I prayed for the blessings of all my supporters in the audience — both visible and invisible! Wink wink!
Hu Tao: Can you guess what happened next?
Traveler: What happened?
Hu Tao: Channeling all my skill and style, with a flick of the wrist I released the dice from my hands, and shouted my battle cry at the top of my lungs!
Paimon: Watch me roll six Pyro dice!
Hu Tao: And lo and behold, when the dice came to rest, I counted precisely six of the Pyro persuasion! It was all over before I could say, "Pyre, pyre, pants on fire!"
Traveler: Amazing.
Paimon: Wow, sounds like your poem worked like a charm!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Director Hu's play style is rapid but graceful, like a lone butterfly navigating the depths of a forest. With a little luck beneath her wings, she soared above the competition.
Ningguang: #Luck... is a key ingredient in every success. Wouldn't you agree, {NICKNAME}?
Paimon: Oh, it's Ningguang and Charlotte! Finished with your business meeting?
Charlotte: Yep! I have to say, the Tianquan has a very incisive mind. She's extremely insightful. I gotta admit, I'm kinda envious of Baiwen now.
Charlotte: Oh wow, you must be Kaedehara Kazuha.
Kaedehara Kazuha: It's a pleasure to meet you, Charlotte.
Charlotte: #First {NICKNAME}, now Kazuha... Feels like I've been inducted into the Teyvat heroes club! I remember when you made the headlines of The Steambird!
Charlotte: "Young Samurai Blocks the Musou no Hitotachi!" You captured the public imagination in Fontaine for some time.
Hu Tao: My oh my! I had no idea I was up against such a legendary warrior in our card duel earlier!
Kaedehara Kazuha: That's all in the past now. I count myself as the fortunate one today for this chance to make so many new friends.
Ningguang: Today is indeed a momentous day to have brought us all together. I propose that I treat everyone to a meal to mark the occasion, if it pleases you all?
Hu Tao: Oh? Sounds like it's victory meal time! Count me in!
Keqing: You'll have to excuse me for a moment while I wrap up things at the tournament venue. I'll join you all later.
Traveler: See you later.
Paimon: This is great! We can have a nice, hearty meal and get a good sleep tonight before heading off to Inazuma tomorrow!
Charlotte: Inazuma? Does this mean you found a new lead on the card snatcher?
Paimon: Sure did! Investigating is what we do best! ...Well, okay, guess luck played a part in it too.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I still have some things to take care of here in Liyue, so I'm afraid I won't be able to accompany you to Inazuma.
Paimon: Okay, but remember to keep working on your Genius Invokation skills. You never know when Paimon Sensei will show up for a surprise inspection!
Traveler: You're getting pretty strict, Paimon Sensei.
Ningguang: I've also heard some things about this card snatcher you're pursuing.
Paimon: Already? Wow, nothing gets past Ningguang, huh...
Ningguang: A new card back appeared on the market recently. It's extremely rare, and bears an image of a treasure chest.
Ningguang: Some players are willing to pay exorbitant amounts of Mora for things of this nature, as they believe they can improve their luck. So I looked into them briefly to see whether there was any genuine commercial value in them.
Ningguang: I quickly learned that every card back with that particular design had been scooped up overnight. There's not a single one left in all of Liyue.
Ningguang: Initially, I thought this might just be another case of a merchant hoarding goods in hopes of maximizing their profits. But once I heard more, I realized it must be the thief you are after.
Charlotte: Is there anything else unusual about these card backs other than their rarity?
Ningguang: Unfortunately, since I didn't manage to procure one for myself, I'm unable to say for sure.
Ningguang: All I know is that despite being custom-made, they are not particularly exquisite — if they were, you can be sure I would have purchased one sooner.

Ningguang: Every journey into the unknown is a mystery waiting to be solved. But often, it is encounters with the unexpected that make the journey all the more interesting.

Traveler: You really care for your students, Paimon Sensei.
