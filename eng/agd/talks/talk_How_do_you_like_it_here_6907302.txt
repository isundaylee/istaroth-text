Traveler: How do you like it here?
Nahida: I think the answer to that should be pretty obvious.
Nahida: You should be able to tell from just one look, like when you peer into a crystal-clear lake and you can see all the fish swimming around inside of it.
Nahida: It's very pleasant here. Even the wind brushing against my toes feels soft and gentle. So of course, I love it.
Traveler: Glad to hear it.
Nahida: As much as a little bird might love exploring the forests and mountains, tasting new and different fruits every day...
Nahida: ...After a long flight, it still needs a place to land and rest its weary wings.
Nahida: So I'm glad that I can roost here in your nest for a while.
Nahida: Also, it's much more spacious here than a birdcage.
Traveler: Stay as long as you like, Nahida.
Nahida: Thank you for being so kind. I know that you mean it, and I'll make the most of my stay here.
