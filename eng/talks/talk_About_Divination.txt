Traveler: About Divination...
Paimon: People in Sumeru seem to take divination and fortune-telling pretty seriously.
Paimon: For starters, there's astrology, although only the scholars get to practice that. But ordinary citizens have their ways, too. They can do divinations with just a cup of coffee!
Traveler: It's the nation of wisdom after all...
Paimon: Paimon heard that they can tell your fate just by looking at the bottom of a finished cup of coffee...
Paimon: Sounds way easier than climbing to the top of a tower and staring at the stars all night!
Traveler: Are you interested in learning your fate, too?
Paimon: Yeah... although, Paimon's really more interested in finding out what the coffee tastes like.
Traveler: It seems like people have an insatiable curiosity to learn about everything, including their own future.
