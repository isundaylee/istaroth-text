Traveler: Still planning collabs, are we?
Grundeland: I... *sigh* I just want to invest in those gentlemen and their Daydream Club, but they keep refusing!
Grundeland: Garcia, especially. He refuses no matter what I say or what promises I make. If anything, he just wants me to leave!
Grundeland: They misunderstand! I... I mean, I used to be that way, but I've changed! I've completely repented and started anew! I want to support their research careers!
