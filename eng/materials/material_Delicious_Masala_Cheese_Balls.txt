# Delicious Masala Cheese Balls

An Aranara-style dish that Paimon drained her brain juice dry to improve. It is, in fact, a rather traditional recipe in Sumeru. The spices were mixed with the other ingredients in a special way to bring out the most original scents. They awaken your taste buds and create a multi-layered flavor profile. The cheese balls are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They go deliciously well with steamy hot potatoes.
