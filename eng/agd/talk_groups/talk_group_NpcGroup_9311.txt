Bennett: If it's okay with you, I think we should check all the pillars in this room, just to make sure they're sturdy.
Bennett: If I spend too long in one place, sooner or later... accidents happen.
Bennett: It's not me I'm worried about. But if I'm gonna keep on adventuring with you, we gotta make sure everybody else is safe.

Bennett: These monsters are stronger all the time... Probably 'cause I'm on the team, I bet.
Bennett: But the good news is, as the leader of Benny's Adventure Team, I've learned a lot about how to draw monsters' attention!
Bennett: I'll lure them out, and once they charge at me, you guys wait for the right moment to take 'em all down!

## Talk 2

Bennett: I've always wanted to go off on a big, long adventure, and grow old along the way, just like my dads.
Bennett: I know there's a lot of bad luck waiting for me out there, and if I'm not careful, I might not have the chance to grow old at all...
Bennett: But my mind's made up. I have to do it! Because... adventuring is my favorite thing!
