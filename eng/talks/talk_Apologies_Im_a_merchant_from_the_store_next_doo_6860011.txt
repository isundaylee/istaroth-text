Guest Message: "Apologies. I'm a merchant from the store next door. Could I ask what the Speaker's Chamber has been doing lately?"
Guest Message: "We often hear dull thudding, and the ground will tremble slightly from time to time... Is it some sort of earthquake? Or is the building going to collapse?"
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "Very sorry! Please rest assured that earthquakes don't happen around here, and the building is very stable."
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "The tremors and dull thuds you heard are from the Pyro Archon's daily routine training."
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "The weight of the barbells used by the Pyro Archon are very heavy, which is why they make a loud noise when they fall to the ground. We will speak to her on the topic. Thank you for your understanding!"
Guest Message: "Might I... ask how much weight is needed to make such a noise...? Anyway, since it's so heavy, wouldn't it be better if she trained outdoors instead?"
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "She said that she sometimes loses control out in the wild, and tends to use weights that are... Let's call them somewhat overboard."
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "Since the last incident, where she almost smashed a certain volcano with a giant rock, causing a landslide, she has endeavored to refrain from further outdoor training."
Guest Message: "...I see. In that case, I, too, suggest that she remain indoors when training."
Speaker's Chamber Reply: "Thank you for your kind understanding. We will send you a set of earplugs."
