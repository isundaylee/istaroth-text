## Talk

Ematol: Let the sparks fly, and the explosions roll! Honorary Knight and the Helper in White, how are you enjoying "Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades"? I'd be happy to answer your questions, whenever you feel like asking them!
Traveler: Care to tell us more about the story behind the latest episode of Dodoco's adventure?
Ematol: Absolutely, I'd be delighted to! When Lisa made me responsible for the sequel, she came up with a load of ideas about the plot...
Ematol: "The big, bad Spikey Fish King, repelled by the valiant Dodoco, slunk back to his lair, tail between his metaphorical legs..."
Ematol: "The Spikey Fish Vanguard said to him: Your Highness! Why don't we gather all the Spikey Fish Elders, Spikey Fish Guards, and Spikey Fish Sweepers, and launch an unstoppable counterattack?"
Ematol: As for how the story pans out... it's probably best if you experience it yourself, Honorary Knight! After all, I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise!
Traveler: The tension's building! Go go, Dodoco!
Paimon: We're rooting for you, Dodoco!
Traveler: I'm gonna take a break now, but I'll be back!
Ematol: No problem! I'm not going anywhere, so whenever you're ready, Honorary Knight!

## Talk

Phonia: Greetings, Honorary Knight and the Helper in White. I'm not technically on duty right now, but I can't go home yet, thanks to this extracurricular project that Ematol has given me.
Traveler: Extracurricular project?
Phonia: Basically, she's worried her record of your experience playing "Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades" might not suffice, so she wanted me to take some extra recordings.
Paimon: Wow! You two really are close, aren't you?
Phonia: The way I see it, this is just a way of banking some credit so Ematol might actually feel guilty the next time she plays a prank on me.
Paimon: Uhh, Paimon's not sure she actually will, but at least it adds another layer to your relationship!
Traveler: Come on Phonia, lighten up!
Phonia: Oh, you think I'm taking it too seriously? People often say that my responses are a bit too by-the-book. Boring, even...
Phonia: But I'm just trying to cut down on unnecessary communication so I can get some peace and quiet.
Paimon: #Umm... Traveler, we should probably go now...
Traveler: Anyway, keep up the good work!
Phonia: Thank you, and have fun. Once we're done with all the recording, it'll finally be time for this cog in the machine to get some rest...
