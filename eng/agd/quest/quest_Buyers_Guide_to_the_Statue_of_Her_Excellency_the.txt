# Buyer's Guide to the Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder


## Talk 1

Paimon: Although Sara didn't say anything, she seemed a little disappointed, don't you think?
Sayu: Awwww... is there really nothing we can do?

## Talk 2

Sayu: Uh oh... you found me.
Paimon: Sayu! What are you doing here? ...Oh, wait... Are you the "professional"?
Sayu: Shh! Quiet, she might still be in earshot!
Traveler: Sayu... have you been slacking off again?
Sayu: No way! I've been here since last night so I could buy a figurine. But after waiting and waiting, my eyes started to feel real droopy, and...
Sayu: I only meant to take a short nap, a really quick one!
Traveler: In short, you overslept.
Sayu: Ohh... If I don't buy one of these figurines, the Tenryou Commission tengu will lock me up for life!
Traveler: Surely not...
Paimon: Sheesh, goodness knows what Miko told you...
Sayu: I guess my only hope now is to sacrifice my salary for this month and buy one off someone who got here in time...
Traveler: Let me negotiate the price for you.
Sayu: Really? Great! Then... here's my salary, please don't spend it all!
Traveler: I'm good at driving a hard bargain.

## Talk 3

Konrad: *sigh*... After coming all this way to Inazuma, and especially getting up early, I still walk away empty-handed.
Konrad: The first batch was smaller than I expected. And who knows when the next batch will come out.
Konrad: Well, since I'm here now... I guess I should buy some other souvenir instead...

## Talk 4

Reika: Huh, you didn't manage to get one either? That's strange... When I came to line up this morning, I checked with my friend who'd already bought one.
Reika: She'd been lining up since before sunrise, and she was around the 100th in line. I was only 150 places behind her, so surely I should've gotten one.
Reika: Hmm... something's wrong here. I'm gonna go ask the shopkeeper for an explanation.

## Talk 5

Junpei: Hehehe, why so glum — didn't manage to get your hands on a "Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder" by any chance?
Junpei: Sell it? Huh, I ain't selling, not after all the effort I put in to get hold of this. Go ask someone else.

## Talk 6

Black Screen Text: You ask around in the area, but to no avail...
Sayu: I can't believe it. I am definitely done for this time...
Paimon: A whole load of people are saying they didn't manage to get one. Did the shopkeepers get the count wrong or something? Hmm... Oh, why don't we go ask at Eipekkusu?
Sayu: Mmm... Might as well. I guess there's nothing to lose...

## Talk 7

Kaede: ...Terribly sorry, I was otherwise occupied this morning, and had someone else watch the shop. So I don't know all the details, but according to our records, we did sell the full 300.
Konrad: Hey, what about those ones at the back? Aren't they for sale?
Kaede: I'm sorry, those are... those are display-only.
Kaede: Please don't be too disappointed. We are only selling a limited number of these statues at the festival, and this was only the first batch. Please rest assured you will all have the chance to purchase one in the future...
Reika: But when will the next batch be ready?
Reika: Also, this poor guy came all the way from Mondstadt. He got here earlier than me and was at least 50 places ahead of me.
Reika: Even he didn't get one. How do you explain these numbers?
Konrad: Look... I don't know a whole lot about Inazuman festivals, but... they do seem to have sold out pretty quickly.
Kaede: I'm terribly sorry, but I've triple-checked the sales records for this morning, and everything seems to be accounted for...
Reika: Hmm... Why don't we get the Tenryou Commission to investigate this?
Sayu: The... the Tenryou Commission? No, no way!
Kaede: Hmm? Sorry, who are you...
Traveler: This is the professional, from the Yashiro Commission.
Reika: Oh? Are you saying this falls under the Yashiro Commission's jurisdiction?
Sayu: Ummm... um... y—yeah, it does! We will follow up on this matter, so... so there's no need to go to the Tenryou Commission! They're busy enough as it is, haha, haha, hah...
Paimon: Eh... that's weird, how come Sayu's so motivated to work all of a sudden?
Sayu: Shh! If the Tenryou Commission finds out about this, Kujou Sara will come ask me about it! And then, she'll find out that I didn't buy her figurine, and...
Traveler: Sayu is supposed to be Miko's hand-picked professional.
Sayu: A—Anyway, we can't get the Tenryou Commission involved, not unless there's no other way!
Reika: Huh... Well, since someone's already on the case, I suppose I'll just wait for the findings.
Konrad: Since I came all this way and didn't get a figurine, I guess I might as well look at what else is available.
Kaede: Thank you both for your understanding. We will make an announcement as soon as the results of the investigation come out.
Paimon: Um, so we're supposed to be investigating, but we don't have any leads at all. Maybe the customers really did made a mistake with the count? If only we had a witness who'd been here the whole time...
Traveler: Technically, someone was here the whole time...
Sayu: You mean me...? Sorry, I was asleep...
Traveler: Did you hear anything in your sleep?
Sayu: Did I hear anything? Uh, let me think...
Konrad: ...I'll take these, please.
Kaede: Thank you for your patronage, please come again.
Sayu: "Thank you"... "patronage"... Oh yeah! Now I remember! I heard "Thank you for your patronage" over and over again this morning.
Paimon: Huh? How many times? 300?
Sayu: Uhh, I mean, I...
Traveler: You don't have to give an exact number.
Sayu: Umm... ummm... ummmmm... I got it! There were at least 16 snores between each "Thank you for your patronage."
Paimon: That's not how you count it!
Sayu: 16 snores should be about 1 minute, and if we add on the time for moving the boxes and stocking the shelves... mmm...
Traveler: It should take at least 5 hours to sell everything.
Sayu: Right! Sales only started about 4 hours ago, so there's definitely a problem with the amount!
Sayu: Wh—Which means, even though I only woke up just now, I still have a chance of getting my hands on one! Maybe...
Traveler: ...A miniscule chance, but yes, you're not wrong.
Sayu: Well, anyway! Maybe I failed my mission because a bad guy did something tricky, not because I was being lazy!
Paimon: So then, who's the bad guy?
Sayu: Hmm, well, the shop was pretty strict with this promotion. Not only was there a 1-per-customer limit, they even checked people's identity. So there's no way anyone could've bought more than one.
Traveler: No wonder each transaction took so long.
Paimon: And with Sara's people patrolling the area, no one could have cut the line, right?
Traveler: By process of elimination...
Traveler: The remaining option is...
Paimon: If someone was up to no good, they'd definitely try to find a way to sell the figurines at a higher price!
Paimon: Let's go ask the guy who says he had to put in a lot of effort to get hold of one. Maybe he knows something!
Traveler: Roughly how long did each transaction take?
Traveler: She technically should have been the first in line.

## Talk 8

Junpei: Huh? You want to know how I got my hands on this statue? Hehehe, dream on!
Paimon: Huh? Why? It's not like we're trying to buy yours off you...
Junpei: It's a no, okay? No more questions.
Sayu: Huh, how come...
Traveler: A staff member sold it to you.
Junpei: How... how did you know!?
Traveler: We're professionals.
Sayu: Huh? Oh... oh, right, yeah, we are professionals!
Junpei: Okay, fine. Since you guessed it anyway... But let me be clear — don't spread this around.
Junpei: I came here bright and early to line up, but the first batch of statues sold out almost immediately. I wasn't very happy about that, so I went around to the back door of Eipekkusu to see if I could find a shop assistant to ask about when the next batch would be coming out.
Junpei: To my surprise, I saw him moving boxes and boxes worth of statues out of the store! Needless to say, I was all ready to march up and demand to know what was going on, but...
Traveler: He gave you a figurine to keep you quiet?
Junpei: Well... uh, yes — but I paid the shop assistant full price for it, so it was still a legitimate transaction!
Kujou Sara: It's not for you to decide whether it was a legitimate transaction or not.
Junpei: Huh? It's... the Tenryou Commission?
Kujou Sara: The Tenryou Commission has received reports that someone has been hoarding goods to resell at extortionate prices. Now, these are not classed as strategic materials, so some amount of price fluctuation is expected on the market. However...
Kujou Sara: It is against the law for a staff member to abuse their position to forge sales records and misappropriate goods!
Kujou Sara: We have already investigated the situation at Eipekkusu. The sales records are correct, but in the cash box, there are two bags in which most of the cash has been replaced with stones.
Junpei: But... but how can this be?
Kujou Sara: Please hand over your "Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder" as evidence. We will compensate you for your loss once we catch the individual responsible.
Junpei: Ugh, fine. So this guy was cooking the books, never saw that coming...
Black Screen Text: Junpei hands over the statue.
Paimon: You guys figured this out pretty quickly, Sara.
Kujou Sara: In fact, we were only just tipped off. We're still working on the logistics of the arrest operation... Hmm? Who's this...
Sayu: Yikes! I've been spotted...
Traveler: This is Sayu.
Kujou Sara: Oh, you must be the professional Lady Guuji hired? I was just wondering why I hadn't seen you yet...
Sayu: Ummm... we... we were... investigating the missing figurines... oh, I mean "Statues of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder"...
Kujou Sara: Is that so? Then thank you. The Tenryou Commission will take over from here. Rest assured we will get to the bottom of the matter.
Sayu: Uhhh...
Kujou Sara: ...Hmm?
Sayu: Um, umm... so, uh... about your statue...
Traveler: Sayu has been lining up since last night...
Kujou Sara: Really? Thank you. So where is the "Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder"?
Traveler: ...But she saw someone misappropriating the statues!
Paimon: ...Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah! Sayu spent the whole night investigating the staff! So by the time she got back, she was just too late to buy one...
Sayu: ...Yeah, right! I definitely would have made it back in time to buy one, if only it hadn't been for someone stealing the statues!
Kujou Sara: I see... So in the end, you did not manage to purchase a statue, correct?
Sayu: *sobbing*... I'm sorry...
Kujou Sara: ...Don't blame yourself. The criminal is the one responsible here. The important thing now is to devise a plan to bring him to justice as swiftly as possible.
Sayu: Mm-hmm...
Kujou Sara: According to the intelligence, the suspect has already started reselling the statues near the festival venue. But he is lying low, and operating very discreetly.
Kujou Sara: If we confront him head-on, he is likely to destroy the evidence and dash. Instead, we will seek to quietly surround him — but in order to achieve this, we will require one person to approach and distract him...
Kujou Sara: Since you've spent the whole night thoroughly investigating this situation, I can think of no one else more suitable to gain his trust than you.
Kujou Sara: Would you be willing to help the Tenryou Commission one final time?
Sayu: What? Uh, hehe, right! Leave it to us! Hahaha... haha... hah...

## Talk 9

Seigou: Hmm? Who introduced you? I'm trying to keep a low profile here, so I'm afraid I don't take any new business except for referrals by existing customers.
Traveler: We were referred by the one who caught you stealing the statues.
Seigou: Tsk... That guy. Fine, he did technically buy from me, I suppose...
Seigou: But let me be clear. This product is highly sought-after right now. I can't sell to you at the same price he paid.
Paimon: The price has gone up again? But it's only been a few hours!
Seigou: Hmph, well you can take it or leave it. Believe me, there's plenty more room for upwards mobility on the price, it just so happens to be in my interests to get these off my hands sooner rather than later. Besides... good luck trying to find anyone else out there selling.
Sayu: #Hmm... we gotta keep negotiating as long as we can, Traveler...
Traveler: Will this figurine keep its value over time?
Seigou: I don't have time for this. Just name your price.
Traveler: Can you give me a little discount?

## Talk 10

Seigou: You think this is a game or something? If you're not serious about buying, quit wasting my time. I should be moving on to my next location by now, not stuck here arguing with you...
Kujou Sara: The next location you move to will be the Police Station. You are under arrest for abusing your position for personal gain and falsifying accounts. Do not attempt to resist, the evidence is indisputable.
Seigou: The Tenryou Commission? When did you... Wait, all that negotiating...
Paimon: Hehehe, stick 'em up!
Black Screen Text: The Tenryou Commission escorts the shop assistant back to the Police Station. Sayu's salary, much to her elation, has also been preserved...
Kujou Sara: Thank you for your help. The culprit has revealed the location where he stashed the statues. We have sent people to collect them.
Paimon: Great. So once Eipekkusu has counted the goods and stocked the shelves, we can get back in the line to buy one, right?
Sayu: This time... I must complete my mission!
Kujou Sara: ...I'm afraid it's not that simple. The stolen goods will have to be kept as evidence at the Police Station for some time. They will not be available for purchase in the immediate future.
Paimon: Paimon can't believe it...
Kujou Sara: I would be grateful if you could inform the shopkeeper about this. I should return to the station and see how things are going.

## Talk 11

Kaede: ...I see. Thank you, we'll make a compensation plan and announce it as soon as possible.
Traveler: Okay. Well, see you then...
Kaede: ...Wait. Hold on. Although this "Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder" was only intended as a display item...
Kaede: Now that I think about it... why don't you have it? As a gesture of my gratitude.
Kaede: After all, it was our negligence that caused trouble for you all on this occasion. This is just a small gift, a mere token, but I do hope you can accept it.
Sayu: R—Really?
Traveler: Shall we give this to Sara?
Sayu: Sounds good... As long as we give this to Sara, my mission will be completed.
Sayu: Uh oh... I've been so nervous all day, and now I can finally relax, I feel really tired all of a sudden...
Sayu: #Please, Traveler... take this figurine to the Police Station... zzz...
Sayu: Sayu... signing out...

## Talk 12

Paimon: Sara, look what we've brought you!
Kujou Sara: Oh, is this...
Black Screen Text: You take out the statue and explain what happened.
Paimon: We just grabbed it and came straight here. But now that Paimon takes a closer look at it, it's really well-made...
Kujou Sara: Of course. This is a prototype designed by Yae Publishing House's top artist and crafted by the most skilled lacquerware master in Inazuma City...
Kujou Sara: Otherwise, how could one hope to capture even one thousandth of the Almighty Shogun's majesty?
Kujou Sara: Let alone maintain it. To do that, you must buy a special kind of shrine and worship it properly.
Kujou Sara: It's also essential to clean it often to avoid a buildup of dust, and it's best practice to hire a craftsman to perform regular maintenance...
Paimon: Sara... Sara!
Kujou Sara: Hmm? What's wrong? These are the five principles for maintenance of the "Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder," and I haven't even finished explaining the first one...
Ei: I never knew there was such a fuss over these tiny figurines... I'm surprised Miko never mentioned it to me.
Kujou Sara: Y—Your Excellency!? This is most unexpected...
Ei: I had some spare time, so I decided to come out for a stroll. Oh, did you buy this figurine yourself?
Kujou Sara: I... it's... it was...
Kujou Sara: #It was {F#her}{M#him.}
Paimon: Hey, what—
Traveler: Yep.
Ei: #Oh, I didn't know you liked little trinkets like these, Traveler.
Kujou Sara: Your Excellency... I've yet to finish the defense arrangements for the Irodori Festival. Please excuse me.
Ei: Very well. Thank you.
Black Screen Text: Sara leaves, her head lowered...
Paimon: Watching Sara leave... she looked kinda sad.
Ei: #...Traveler, I have another such figurine in Tenshukaku, a sample sent by Yae Publishing House. I don't need it, so I think I will gift it to you.
Traveler: But we already have one...
Ei: I shall not go back on my word. I have committed to giving it to you, what you choose to do with it is your business. You are quite free to give it to somebody else, if you wish.
Ei: Or, to save you the trouble, I can have someone from Tenshukaku deliver it directly. But of course, your name will have to be written as the sender.
Paimon: Whew, why does all this have to be so complicated...
Traveler: Paimon...
Ei: ...
Traveler: Just send it to the Tenryou Commission, please.
Ei: Good. I'll have someone attend to this shortly.
Ei: Oh — and I wish you a pleasant and enjoyable Irodori Festival.
Traveler: #Put "Traveler" as the sender.
Traveler: No more questions.
Traveler: It was me.

### Additional Talk 1

Seigou: Deal. Let's schedule a time for you to pick up the product.
Paimon: Hold on! Paimon thinks that price is still a little too high...
Seigou: You think that's high? Hmph, it'll be at least double that in a few days!

### Additional Talk 2

Seigou: Ugh, fine, fine. I swear if I wasn't in a rush to get rid of them... Hmph!

### Additional Talk 3
