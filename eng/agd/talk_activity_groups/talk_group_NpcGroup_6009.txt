Siyah: Hello, hello. I should probably give you a heads-up â€” the way things are categorized here isn't exactly the clearest...

Traveler: What do you sell here?
Siyah: I must apologize, the things the Association's been sending over lately have been a bit random, and I haven't had time to sort them all out yet...

Traveler: What do you sell here?
Siyah: Let me see... These are the ones that have already been added to the inventory, so please feel free to take your pick.

Traveler: What is this place?
Siyah: We're an outlet of the Saurian Relics Association, and I'm the manager.
Siyah: As I'm sure you know, Natlan is the nation where Saurians and humans live together, so naturally, many treasures are still knocking about from the times of the ancient Saurians.
Siyah: The Saurian Relics Association is an organization that was specifically established to collect and sort through all these items.
Siyah: ...But actually, that's more like the official way of describing it.
Siyah: In truth, due to the sheer variety of different items we've collected, it's essentially turned into a giant flea market... I know, there's almost something comical about it...

Traveler: See you.
Siyah: Take care.

Traveler: Don't worry, that's what has become of my backpack as well.
Siyah: Really? You can fit all that stuff in your backpack!?
Siyah: ...Oh, haha! You're having me on, aren't you? Nearly got me too, you did...
Siyah: *sigh* Jokes aside, if you know any tricks for organizing things, you really must share them with me.
Siyah: They all said that the Children of Echoes have a knack for business, which is why they chose me to be the shopkeeper here.
Siyah: But in reality, what this place actually needs is a storage specialist...
