# Glaze Domain, Multum in Parvo


## Talk 1

Paimon: It went this way, right? Hope we haven't lost it...
Paimon: Did the Water Droplet go into that cave?

## Talk 2

Klee: Wow, another Water Droplet just came out from the wall...

## Talk 3

Idyia: Okay, this is the spot.
Idyia: Now, I'm sure you're both wondering: "But where's the component?"
Idyia: "There's nothing here! Oh, where could it be..."
Paimon: Oh, it's that lamp thingy, right? Water Droplet showed us how that works already.
Idyia: Uh... yes, that's the one... There goes my big introduction.
Idyia: Showing people the ropes is supposed to be my job... I can't believe I'm being shown up by a Hydro Eidolon...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Cheer up, Idyia. The Hydro Eidolon can give a basic demonstration of how to use things, but beyond that, it can't communicate...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: That's where you come in. Your descriptions can explain everything in full, vivid detail.
Paimon: Paimon forgot how persuasive Kokomi can be when she really wants to... Sometimes having a genius strategist around really comes in handy.
Traveler: (Now I see how an eloquent speaker can persuade others to not only agree with them, but do things for them...)
Idyia: Oh, if you put it that way... Well then, just pretend like you've never seen it before, and I'll tell you all about it!
Idyia: This is called the Streaming Projector. Everything here in the Veluriyam Mirage was made using this device...
Idyia: All you need to do is place an item in the Projector, and you can construct a corresponding item based on the shape of the original and your imagination.
Idyia: ...At least, I think that's what it used to do. With the domain in its current state, only its most basic functions are still operable.
Traveler: Basic functions... like shining light?
Idyia: Okay, not quite that basic... At the moment, it's only able to show two-dimensional objects. I call them "preprints."
Idyia: Think of it like a sort of draft or blueprint, or something.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: So you're saying, the component fell into the preprints?
Idyia: Yes, exactly. I'll leave you to go in and physically retrieve it, while I... Uh, I'll be out here rooting for you by... by doing a motivational dance!
Paimon: Really?
Idyia: ...No. Sorry. I feel like I have two left feet when I try to dance. I guess I'll just... find a place nearby to sit and wait patiently for you...
Paimon: Hey, come on, cheer up. We'll handle everything from here!

## Talk 4

Idyia: I remember seeing it just behind the Central Hub...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: ...So how come you didn't bring it back when you first saw it?
Idyia: I'd have been more than happy to, if this one component was enough to fix the whole domain.
Idyia: But with three other components to find... I suddenly felt overwhelmed by how much work needed doing...
Paimon: Paimon kinda gets that... Taking the first step is always the hardest part.

## Talk 5

Idyia: Doesn't look like the component is in here...

## Talk 6

Paimon: Hey Idyia, you got an update for us? We've all caught up with each other.
Idyia: Very well. Then please allow me, Idyia, your Mascot, to explain exactly what's happened here...
Traveler: (She's pretty happy with this Mascot role, huh...)
Idyia: Basically, this entire domain is powered by a device called the Central Hub, which you all saw earlier.
Idyia: But following a major incident, several key components from the Central Hub came loose and went flying.
Idyia: ...Four components, I believe, which has caused the Central Hub to stop turning.
Klee: Ohhh, so that thing's supposed to spin?
Idyia: Yes! It definitely shouldn't be frozen still like it is now! ...At least, that's not how it was when I first got here? Ugh, I've done such a terrible job of taking care of it, it's so embarrassing...
Paimon: Hey, everything's gonna be okay. So, we need to fix the big wheel up there, and to do that we need to find the missing parts.
Idyia: Right... I do know where one of the parts is. It landed not too far away.
Idyia: But the rest all landed in different areas. I'm afraid you'll have to go and look for those...
Idyia: Ahem! Now, as the caretaker and your mascot, I shall announce your respective adventure duties!
Collei: Umm... You can just be yourself if you want, no need to force the whole roleplaying thing...
Idyia: ...Oh, I see... Um, okay, so I was thinking that maybe Swordmaster Eula and Healer Collei could investigate the northern zone, if that's okay?
Eula: Fine by me. I was going to be looking for my cousin there anyway.
Collei: I'll be your backup, Eula. I know you usually team up with Amber, so I'll try my best to fill her shoes.
Eula: Oh? Well this'll be fun. Let's see if a forest ranger can outperform an outrider.
Idyia: Master Thief Kaeya and Mage Klee, if you could earmark some time in your busy schedules to search the west zone...
Klee: Earmark? What does that mean?
Kaeya: It just means we mustn't forget to do it. Don't worry, we can handle that.
Idyia: #Finally, we have our General, Miss Sangonomiya, and our Knight, Traveler. If there's no objections, please come with me to retrieve the first component.
Traveler: Understood.
Idyia: Alright. Well, if anyone finds anything, come back here and we'll regroup.
Idyia: Please take care while you're out on the road, and look after each other... especially our little mage here.
Klee: You got it! I'll take extra-special care of Kaeya.
Kaeya: I'll be on my best behavior.
Idyia: ...
Idyia: Okay, we'll leave it there for now. You two, please follow me.
Traveler: You have my sword!
Idyia: Wow... Spoken like a true knight.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hehe... Then for my part, my strategic mind is at your service.

## Talk 7

Idyia: All you need to do is touch the Streaming Projector and you'll enter the world of preprints...
Idyia: Don't worry. It's not dangerous.

## Talk 8

Paimon: What is this thing, anyway? Some kind of gear?
Paimon: And why's it so small? It doesn't look like it belongs in that huge wheel...
Idyia: It's hard to explain, but I assure you that it's definitely one of the components.
Idyia: So that leaves three more components missing...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Every journey begins with a first step. I think we're off to a good start, and things should keep going smoothly from here.
Idyia: Y—You really think so?
Traveler: Of course, trust the General!
Idyia: I suppose you're right... she did manage to defeat class A at the Onmyou chamber, after all...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Um... You, uh, don't need to keep bringing that up!
Idyia: Anyway, thank you for all your help.
Idyia: I'll take this and start trying to repair the Central Hub. You two may as well head back to town.
Idyia: *sigh* Why am I so clumsy? Once again, I was no help at all... The least I can do is try and handle the actual repairs.

## Talk 9

Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hmm...
Paimon: What's wrong, Kokomi?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I'm just a little confused... You mentioned that the Water Droplet showed you how to use the projector?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Can you tell me a little bit more about that? I'm so curious to know what happened.
Paimon: Oh, sure!
Black Screen Text: You tell Kokomi everything that happened earlier with Water Droplet.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I see...
Paimon: Hey, look! The wheel is spinning now.
Paimon: Aww, and now it's stopped again. Well, that didn't last long...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It also wasn't spinning at the right speed. Before the incident, it spun much faster than that.
Paimon: Oh, so you saw it back when it was still working?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Yes. I arrived here a little earlier than the rest of you. But the incident took place not long after I entered.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Like Idyia said, it felt like the world was "flipped upside down"... I don't know how else to describe it... and I certainly don't want to experience it again.
Idyia: *sigh* It's no use... Seems it won't run until all the missing components are returned.
Idyia: For a moment there, when it started turning, I got excited... I thought that maybe the hub can work just fine without the other three...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Wishful thinking is only going to lead to disappointment, Idyia. Let's stick to the plan, we'll get there.
Klee: #Hey, Mr. Honorary Knight and Miss General are here! Oh, and our mascot!
Klee: You beat us! I was sure we were gonna be the first ones back!
Kaeya: Hey. How'd it go?
Traveler: Mission complete!
Kaeya: Haha. Impressive. I doubt you'd find many other knights of such caliber even among the Knights of Favonius.
Idyia: How about our Master Thief and Mage? Did you find anything?
Klee: You bet! We made a huuuge discovery!
Klee: The place we were trying to get to was blocked off. We couldn't see anything past it, and there was no way around.
Klee: But then, just now, a huge canyon appeared outta nowhere... so we hurried back here!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It appeared just now?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: ...
Klee: #Come and see, Mr. Honorary Knight! Let's go on a canyon adventure!
Traveler: To the canyon!
Idyia: I'll sit this one out. I'm beat after trying to make those repairs... I need to take a break.
Klee: Miss General, you should come, too! You can hide behind me and give me smart advice while I protect you!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Wonderful. It would be an honor to serve as adviser for our young mage.
Klee: Hee-hee, let's go!!!
Traveler: Where a knight's sword goes, victory soon follows!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Idyia: Hmm? Who else has visited the Veluriyam Mirage recently? There was someone from the Akademiya who came not long ago... a Kshahrewar scholar. Blond hair, architect, I think?
Idyia: He was a huge help, and redesigned many of the buildings here. Although he was always grumbling to himself, he was extremely diligent in his work. Ah... What a kind person...
Idyia: I could tell that was a sensitive soul, a lot like me... Ah! Sorry, please pretend you didn't hear that... Ahem! I'm of course a very strong and resilient person.
Idyia: After him, an aristocrat from Mondstadt showed up, then the Gen— I mean, Miss Sangonomiya.
Idyia: Unfortunately, everything here suddenly started changing before I'd had the chance to be a good host and show them around.
Eula: Do you know where the Mondstadt aristocrat is now?
Idyia: ...If I remember correctly, he headed north after the incident.
Idyia: It's a pity we're having all these issues... *sigh* If we could get everything working normally again, I could probably locate him in an instant.
Idyia: Still, not to worry. There's nothing dangerous here.
Eula: Mm...

### Additional Talk 2

Klee: #Hi Miss General! Mr. Honorary Knight says that you're from Watatsumi Island...
Klee: What's it like there? There must be loooads of fish, right?
Klee: Wait! You look kinda like a mermaid. Are there fish in your family?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Oh, uh... Sorry to disappoint you, Miss Mage, but I'm just an ordinary human.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I have lots of great stories about Watatsumi Island, though. C'mon, let's enjoy the scenery while I tell you all about it.

### Additional Talk 3

Kaeya: Feeling nervous, Collei? It's your first time as a guide, after all.
Collei: Hmm? Oh no, not at all. I'm just... still settling into the role, so I was thinking about how to talk more like Master Tighnari...
Kaeya: Well, the easiest way to imitate someone is to start with their most common turns of phrase.
Collei: Oh, okay. In that case... Ahem! "Put that mushroom down! Now! It's highly poisonous."
Kaeya: There you go. With just a few simple words, you've captured your master's personality perfectly.
Collei: Anyway, what about your role? Don't you mind being the "Master Thief"? It doesn't sound like you're one of the good guys...
Kaeya: Maybe not — until you factor in that I only steal from the enemy. I think that's enough to make me one of the good guys... don't you?
Collei: Oh, uh... fair point, fair point...
