# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to chat?
Neuvillette: Of course, is there anything you would like to know?
Neuvillette: For example, my experiences of taste-testing the renowned springs of the world?
Traveler: Uh, unfortunately... I don't really have a taste for spring water.
Neuvillette: Ah, then you are missing out on a great many good things in life...
Neuvillette: Perhaps that can't be helped, some things come naturally to certain people, but not to others.
Neuvillette: Did you know that Vishaps lose the ability to distinguish colors over the course of their evolution?
Neuvillette: After the window of opportunity closes, they won't ever be able to enjoy colorful paintings again.
Neuvillette: Oh, I just learn things like this out of personal interest.
Traveler: I feel like I've heard this somewhere before...
Neuvillette: Two things I've learned from the story of Vishaps are:
Neuvillette: First, we must respect the differences between all species as well as all individuals within a species.
Neuvillette: And second, we mustn't squander the best years of our lives.
Neuvillette: How about you? Can you think of anything you should do when you are young, and not wait until you are too old and begin to regret it?
Traveler: To love others and be loved in return?
Neuvillette: Ah, an excellent answer. It exceeds my expectations.
Neuvillette: If only people could actually do that, it would be wonderful... Failure to do so only floods the world with sorrow.
Traveler: To travel all around the world?
Neuvillette: Hmm, a good answer.
Neuvillette: But I think it's never too late to do that. I'm also planning to travel the world in the future, you know.
