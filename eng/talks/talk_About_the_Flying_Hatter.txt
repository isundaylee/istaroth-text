Traveler: About the "Flying Hatter"...
Devitt: Interested in this tale, are you? Hahaha. I'll go over it with you — it's not too long a tale.
Devitt: Hmm... So our tale begins with a masterful hatter.
Devitt: This maker of hats made the very best ones in the world, and each day, there would be a stupendous crowd outside his door. Still, he would make each hat properly and beautifully.
Devitt: Some said that he had even once been commissioned by a goddess to make ten beautiful hats of different styles.
Devitt: To thank him for his craftsmanship, she offered to grant him a wish. But the hatmaker said that he did not have any unfulfilled wishes.
Devitt: He loved what he did, making hats, and everyone loved the hats he made — and that was enough for him.
Devitt: The goddess acknowledged his noble answer, but also stated that her promise would remain valid.
Devitt: Should he ever be willing to make a wish, she would be ready to grant it immediately.
