### Additional Talk 1

Childe: You've finally returned. How was your journey to Jueyun Karst?
Childe: ...I see.
Childe: Oh, you didn't get to see all the adepti yourself? ...Well, as they say, it's up to fate, no?
Childe: Not to worry! If you have the free time, there's no harm in giving it a go again.
Childe: Besides, the information on the Conqueror of Demons is already very valuable. As a returning gift, I too have information for you.
Childe: Regarding the archon's passing... The Liyue Qixing's response really has given me food for thought...
Childe: They've announced that, as the true killer has not yet been found, they are not allowing anyone to pay their respects to the Exuvia.
Childe: They've even gone so far as to try and cut off information... But with the Rite of Descension and all, even the Qixing isn't able to keep a lid on things.
Paimon: Exuvia?
Childe: It's common knowledge in Liyue that Rex Lapis is also an adeptus.
Childe: The Geo Archon is also the God of Contracts, and is also known as the Exuvia, Prime of the Adepti.
Childe: The mighty and illuminated adepti of today all signed contracts to protect Liyue way back then.
Paimon: Guess that explains why they're all so focused on Liyue's well-being.
Childe: Naturally. They both have the responsibility and the aptitude for the job.
Childe: If the ruling Qixing became unable to perform their duty properly, the adepti have the right to take corrective action.
Traveler: This makes things difficult for me too.
Traveler: I agree, something is definitely not right.
Childe: The Geo Archon's spirit has risen, so why would the Qixing hide his vessel? Truly suspicious.
Paimon: Oh! Right! He's the whole reason we came here!
Paimon: If the Liyue Qixing has locked up Exuvia and won't let anyone near...
Paimon: #Then {NICKNAME}'s quest to find The Seven is already over!
Traveler: Nothing to do with you.
Traveler: No comment.
Childe: Oh? You're trying to find The Seven? And just why might that be, pray tell?
Childe: Heh... nice answer.
Childe: A knight that gets duped by the Fatui would really be no knight at all now, would they?
Childe: But, I can help you with that too you know.
Paimon: Hmm? Really?
Childe: Give me some time.
Childe: Time... to find someone.
Childe: Someone who can help you break through this stalemate.
Childe: Truly fascinating. The harder they try to silence the situation, the greater the chaos that erupts...
Childe: If you want to be around to see it all come crashing down, best you stay alive until we next meet, yes?

### Additional Talk 2

Childe: You've finally returned. How was your journey to Jueyun Karst?
Childe: ...I see.
Childe: Moon Carver, Mountain Shaper, Cloud Retainer, Conqueror of Demons...
Childe: Some of these names have never come up in the intel the Fatui gets hold of.
Childe: As a returning gift, I too have information for you.
Childe: Regarding the archon's passing... The Liyue Qixing's response really has given me food for thought...
