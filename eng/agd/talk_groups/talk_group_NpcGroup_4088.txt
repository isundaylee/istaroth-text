Traveler: Are you alright?
Qushji: My neck... It hurts...
Qushji: This is probably the ordeal all astrologers must go through. The weight of the starry sky seems to crash down on the neck when you stargaze.
Qushji: Worse yet, the hydromantic instruments in the academy fell into disrepair due to budget constraint.
Qushji: Researchers like us who aren't part of big projects must resort to more primitive measures...
Qushji: If only the new Grand Conservator knew the value of astrology...

Qushji: I'll also have more time to take better care of myself now.

Traveler: The new Grand Conservator?
Qushji: Yes... A youngster like you should be better informed than me.
Qushji: Everyone in Sumeru City is paying close attention to the matter, be it an ordinary researcher like myself or a barber in the downtown area.
Qushji: If the new Grand Conservator is interested in astrology, he might apply for some funding and restart the use of those hydromantic instruments.
Qushji: I can also benefit from his influence and no longer have to stick out my old neck again.
Qushji: So that means... I'd prefer to have Rifaet be the next Grand Conservator.
