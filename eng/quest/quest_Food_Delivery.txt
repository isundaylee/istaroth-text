# Food Delivery


## Talk 1

Sara: Order for delivery
Sara: Welcome to Good Hunterâ€” Oh, hello Traveler! You've come just at the right time.
Sara: Sorry, I know you must be hungry, but could you do something for me?
Sara: Miss Orlean from Springvale ordered a <color=#00E1FFFF>Sticky Honey Roast</color>, but I hear Springvale's crawling with slimes these days...
Sara: I don't dare attempt the journey myself... Could you deliver this order to <color=#00E1FFFF>Orlean in Springvale</color> for me?
Traveler: I guess, but...
Sara: Rest assured there'll be a hearty meal waiting for you on your return!
Sara: I'm counting on you!
Traveler: I only came here to eat; I'm starving!
Sara: Once you've done what I ask, I'll treat you to something from the Good Hunter special menu! Much obliged.

## Talk 2

Lively Orlean: Thanks! Ugh, these slimes are such a pain.
Lively Orlean: If I hadn't had such low blood sugar, I'd have taught them a lesson myself...
Traveler: Your meal, ma'am.
Lively Orlean: Mmm... Smells carroty and meaty... It's a shame it didn't get here sooner, I would have sent those slimes flying if I'd been fighting on a full stomach!
Lively Orlean: Can't be helped I suppose. Here's the money, take it back to Sara for me.

## Talk 3

Sara: Deliver meal fee
Sara: You're back! Did the delivery go okay?
Traveler: Here's the fee.
Sara: Let me check... Yep! Thanks!
Sara: Here, this <color=#00E1FFFF>Delicious Crab, Ham & Veggie Bake</color> is for you. It's fresh out of the oven, eat it while it's hot.
