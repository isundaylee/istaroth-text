Traveler: About the Sign of Apaosha...
Mihir: Considering a lot of what happened was pretty unexpected... Well, unexpected for Sorush, anyhow.
Mihir: With the sign extinguished, I assume Sorush has also learned much from the Chaplet.
Mihir: The greater struggle itself, however, is not over. As Pari, our duty remains even with the quelling of the sign.
