Traveler: You've got lots of brothers then?
Shikun: Oh no, they're not actually my brothers! We're just a group of pals who work together regularly.
Shikun: I'm one of the younger ones, so I call them my big brothers!
Shikun: We often help our neighbors out, and in return, they've dubbed us the "Six Little Dragons of Qiaoying Village."
Shikun: I'm the fourth oldest, so that makes me "Fourth Dragon"! Haha...
Shikun: These past two years, Fifth and Sixth have left to work as a bodyguard and a boatman respectively. Third's found a job at Yilong Wharf...
Shikun: So it's usually just the three of us — First, Second, and little old Fourth — drinking and chatting about our families.
Shikun: As fulfilling as a hard day's work is, a lazy day's not a bad day either!
