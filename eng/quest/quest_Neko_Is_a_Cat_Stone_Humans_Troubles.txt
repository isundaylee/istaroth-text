# Neko Is a Cat: Stone Human's Troubles


## Talk 1

Neko: "Celery"...
Traveler: How's the statue?
Neko: That stone human is most skilled, meow meow meow.
Traveler: Is it done?
Neko: No, but before I knew it, he had brought a big, big stone over.
Neko: He then started to knock on it, donk-donk-donk, all while muttering things about "employer" and "salary."
Neko: Speaking of which, I would like to ask: what is an "envoyer," and what is "celery"?
Traveler: I think you mean "employer" and "salary."
Paimon: Basically, since you asked him to do something, he should be given something in return.
Neko: Ah, is that the case? So humans are particular about such things... Alright. I shall permit him to scratch my ears.
Paimon: Uh, Paimon doesn't think that's enough...
Neko: Is it not? Hmm, then perhaps I should give him something to eat.
Traveler: I think what he wants is Mora...
Neko: Mora? Are these things not for shoving inside the Offering Box? How strange. To think that humans were concerned about such things.
Traveler: Well, a salary is very important, actually.
Neko: Mmph. I will trust your words on account of the aid you've provided so far. I will speak to the stone human when we return.
Neko: However, the stone human is no longer going donk-donk-donk. He seems to be carrying a short wooden pole, who knows what for...
Paimon: A wooden pole? Isn't statue-carving done with a hammer, a chisel, and stuff like that?
Traveler: Did his tools break or something...
Paimon: #Oh brother. Come on then, Traveler, let's go find Mr. Ooshima. Sounds like he needs some help!

## Talk 2

Neko: A "celery" is important to humans. I will remember that.

## Talk 3

Ooshima Junpei: *sigh* How am I supposed to work without a hammer or chisel...
Traveler: Encountering some trouble?
Ooshima Junpei: Oh, it's you. Well... I was careless. I didn't check my tools properly when we came here, so just as I was getting engrossed in my work, I broke my hammer and chisel by mistake...
Ooshima Junpei: I'd like to return to Narukami Island to buy some more, but...
Ooshima Junpei: How do I put this... I guess I'm just more used to finishing work like this in one go, you know?
Ooshima Junpei: My tools might be broken, but I can still do some measurements and figure out how I want to continue carving.
Ooshima Junpei: If I left now and went to Narukami Island to get some tools, I'd probably have to re-acquaint myself with the "feel" of this carving...
Ooshima Junpei: Also, this stone's composition is very hard. If we were to use ordinary tools, they would break pretty quickly.
Ooshima Junpei: Hmm, you know what...
Ooshima Junpei: Traveler, could you help me find 3 Iron Chunks?
Ooshima Junpei: I plan on making some tools personally, ones suited to the task.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Ooshima Junpei: Great! It's up to you, then.
Traveler: You're going to forge them yourself?
Ooshima Junpei: Come on, I'm someone who worked at Tatarasuna. Of course I know a thing or three about forging.
Ooshima Junpei: However, I probably shouldn't start any sort of furnace at the shrine. I imagine that the Lady Priestess would be displeased. It is a cat, after all.
Ooshima Junpei: Either way, please help me find 3 Iron Chunks.

## Talk 4

Ooshima Junpei: Wonderful! These will do, I think.
Ooshima Junpei: I'll go find a suitable place outside to set a furnace up, and then I'll start making my tools.
Ooshima Junpei: Just let the Lady Priestess know, would you? I'll be packing up over here.

## Talk 5

Ooshima Junpei: Hey there, have you secured the 3 Iron Chunks?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Neko: Meow meow meow. Is something the matter? Not to worry, I will prepare an adequate "celery."
Traveler: It's "salary."
Paimon: Uh, never mind. Basically, the stone human... Mr. Ooshima's tools are broken, but we gave him the materials he needs to repair 'em, so there shouldn't be any problem!
Neko: Mm? Problems, you say?
Traveler: ...
Neko: That is good. I look forward to seeing that stone, yes.
Neko: Hibiki said that once the stone in my likeness was made, some good thing might happen.
Neko: Ah, I am filled with expectation! What sort of good thing might happen? Perhaps Hibiki may even return...
Traveler: No, there aren't any issues. Things are going well.
Traveler: How much is it going to be?
Neko: Mm? What does "how much" mean?
