# A Gifted Rose: Some People Never Fade Away


## Talk 1

Affan: I was about to lose hope. Didn't expect this flower to actually grow. I guess as long as we're alive, wonderful things can still happen to us.
Affan: Little one, are you still sad about Uncle Shafaqat? Don't worry. The living have to carry on with the wishes of those who passed away. We can't let them down.
Sabbah: Mr. Affan... I'm not so young anymore. Those friends I grew up with... their kids must be old enough now to go buy spices at the store.
Sabbah: But I agree. Since we're alive, we may as well try our best to live a happy life.

## Talk 2

Affan: It's you guys. Well then, we and the roses have all been waiting for you.
Paimon: Sabbah came early too!
Sabbah: I've been coming here a lot lately, and I've read the notes that Mr. Shafaqat left behind.
Sabbah: I used to feel lonely staying in Aaru Village, but I feel differently now.
Sabbah: At least I'm not completely alone. I have these roses, the memories of being with you guys, and Mr. Affan.
Sabbah: I still have some good things in my life, and just thinking of that makes me feel less lonely.
Sabbah: Mr. Affan and I have had a discussion. I will help him tend to the Golden Roses from now on.
Sabbah: We'll cultivate more of them till they fill the whole nursery. But for now, let's get these to bloom.
Sabbah: Do you remember how you made my Sumeru Roses bloom? Let's use the same method.
Traveler: Let us help.
Sabbah: Okay, it's up to you now.

## Talk 3

Black Screen Text: "Rose, oh roses, grant me my wish."
Black Screen Text: "Blooming from the stone, the Golden Rose sang to me."

## Talk 4

Sabbah: Use the power of *Dendro* to awaken the flower sleeping within the shoots.

## Talk 5

Black Screen Text: "Rose, oh roses, grant me my wish."
Black Screen Text: "Blooming from the stone, the Golden Rose sang to me."
Paimon: Golden Roses really are beautiful. Seeing them bloom has really brightened Paimon's day!
Paimon: These days of hard work were not in vain. Paimon's so happy!
Traveler: The wish has finally been fulfilled.
Affan: I finally did something right in the end. Uncle Shafaqat, I've helped you fulfill your wish.
Sabbah: It's a shame he is no longer around to see it.
Affan: Don't say that, Sabbah. Do you remember the last stanza of the rose song?
Affan: "No land but folk songs bore my spirit."
Affan: "Songs shall defy my fate, and overcome my destiny."
Affan: "They will surpass me, surpass time. They will surpass the ever-lasting withering of life."
Affan: Uncle Shafaqat's life, the Golden Roses, and the folk song he composed himself â€” they have all remained with us.
Sabbah: Yeah, you're right. He has surpassed time and the withering of life.
Sabbah: Thank you for telling me about him. This means a lot to me.
Sabbah: He was an exile before me, and seeing the traces of his life here always makes me feel like I've crossed through time and space...
Sabbah: I'm not just looking at him. I'm looking at myself too.
Sabbah: I can no longer say anything to him, but I can shoulder his regrets and live on.
Sabbah: If I live on for him too, then I'm sure that I will eventually find my own salvation.
Traveler: I wish you happiness.
Sabbah: I don't feel so bad living here anymore. I'm... so glad I met you all.
Sabbah: Roses truly are flowers that can bring people happiness. Mr. Affan, we shall have to work hard and plant more roses here in the future.
Affan: Hahaha! Well then, you have a deal.
Sabbah: Mm, I'll do my best.
Traveler: Keep your chin up.
Traveler: It was all worth it.

## Talk 6

Affan: If these few specimens grow well, we will be able to cultivate more Golden Roses.
Affan: But until then, I think I would feel quite a bit more assured if these few roses bloomed first.
