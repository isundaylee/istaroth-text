Traveler: You do have a point.
Angelique: Hah, it seems we'll make good friends in this case.
Angelique: To be honest, I recently made a pen pal, and we've got a good thing going. He hinted that he'd like to meet me at Hotel Debord. I've been wondering if I should agree.
Angelique: Staying pen pals would be the safe decision, of course. I mean, if we were to meet, and sparks were to fly, how could I still call myself "rational above all"?
