# Talk Activity Group: 2003

## Talk

Traveler: How's your work coming along?
Marvin: I wrote a little when the inspiration hit, but I feel like... Um, this is rather embarrassing...
Traveler: Mind reading it out to me?
Marvin: Sure! As... as long as you don't laugh... heh.
Marvin: "You and I
Like the stars and moon
The wind and the clouds
Like flowers and mist
Never shall we part."
Marvin: H—How is it... Will it do?
Traveler: Seems a little plain.
Marvin: Is that so? Hmm, I thought so too... I've got to practice more so that I can write Marla a better poem.
Marvin: Thanks! I'll make some edits before handing this in. Please give me a while more, Professor Venti!
Traveler: Expressive, if a bit immature.

## Talk

Traveler: How's your work coming along?
Albert: Oh, you mean the homework that Professor Venti gave us...
Albert: Don't worry about it! Even though preparing a gift for Barbara-sama is my top priority, creating a poem filled with passion is just as important!
Albert: Let me show you the power of a fan's heart!
Albert: "No further distance in this world below
Wider even than life and death
Than that of the Cathedral window
You within — I, outside left"
Traveler: Not bad, though it's kind of ordinary.
Albert: *sigh* It seems that you lack spirit — you still do not understand the regard in which we hold Barbara-sama.
Albert: But it's fine, you have much time ahead of you. Good luck, Traveler!
Albert: Let me give this a bit more thought and come up with a better version, and then I can submit it to Professor Venti.
Traveler: How about not peeping next time, eh?

## Talk

Traveler: How's your work coming along?
Ellin: Oh, you mean the love poem I'm writing for Master Jean! I—I'm still working on it!
Ellin: Professor Venti was teaching us tricks for writing love poems, yes, but what I'd like to express is more like admiration and yearning.
Ellin: I did write a poem, but I haven't had the time to send it to the Professor just yet... Would you like to hear it?
Traveler: Lay it on me.
Ellin: "Your earnest profile working
Like the moon in the night sky gleaming
It leads me into restful dreaming"
Ellin: How is it? Will it do?
Traveler: I can feel your sincerity!
Ellin: Really? That's great! That's exactly what I'd like to express!
Ellin: Thank you! I'll make a few more improvements, and then I'll hand it in.
Traveler: Very passionate indeed...

## Talk

Traveler: See you around!
Plauen: See you. Come back and challenge this domain again if you have the time.

## Talk

Traveler: Do you know about any of the other activities?
Plauen: Hmm, for this, you can go look for Lizzie. She's always introducing fun events to people during the Windblume Festival.
Plauen: I hope that you'll enjoy yourself, too!

## Talk

Traveler: What's in this domain?
Plauen: This is a special domain that was discovered by the Adventurers' Guild some time ago. It seems to only turn up at specific times.
Plauen: There are quite a few interesting things going on inside. We've opened it to the public after some modification work.
Plauen: If you're interested, please feel free to attempt this challenge. Do it alone, or call your friends, either is fine!
Traveler: It's not dangerous in there, is it?
Plauen: Don't worry, we'll have seasoned adventurers accompanying you all the way if you bring people without any experience.
Plauen: But I think that a veteran such as you will be fine.

## Talk

Plauen: Give it a go! This is the special festive event that the Adventurers' Guild has prepared for everyone.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Lizzie: See you. Happy Windblume Festival!

## Talk

Traveler: What do you do here?
Lizzie: I'm in charge of welcoming guests, and of organizing all sorts of fun activities for everyone during the Windblume Festival.
Lizzie: A lot of the events are being held outdoors due to the large area needed, so without a guide to tell them where things are happening, lots of people are going to miss out!
Lizzie: And I, Lizzie, am glad to step up to that plate!
Traveler: So what's going on, then?
Lizzie: There are three events taking place during the festival: "Bullseye Balloons," "Floral Freefall," and "Ballads of Breeze".
Lizzie: As for the details... As opposed to having me explain, I think it might be easier if you try them out yourself.
Lizzie: As long as the preparations for the activity have already been made, I can tell you where they're being held.
Lizzie: May you have a happy Windblume Festival!
Traveler: Are there any other interesting things to do?
Lizzie: I've heard that the Adventurers' Guild has something special up their sleeve for the Windblume Festival.
Lizzie: If you're interested, I'd advise you to look for an adventurer named Plauen. He'll tell you all about it!

## Talk

Lizzie: Hey there! Having fun this Windblume Festival?

## Talk

Godwin: *sigh* I wonder how Glory is doing...
Godwin: I wish I could return to Mondstadt to see her... But I can't. How can I let her know that her lover is a coward and a deserter?
Godwin: The best I can do now is clear out monsters and do my part to protect Mondstadt... and her.
Godwin: Laugh if you want. I'm... I'm a useless man.

## Talk

Doolan: This is the time of the Windblume Festival, the season when dandelions float about in the wind.
Doolan: I've always been looking forward to a time when I might express my love for my destined one amid a sea of billowing dandelions...
Doolan: But I never expected Miss Patchi to be too absorbed in her research to understand a thing I was saying...
Doolan: Nothing could be more boring than spending such a romantic festival buried knee-deep in books ruins.
Doolan: Who knows how long it'll take for her to understand these deep yet nebulous feelings of mine...

## Talk

Patchi the Curious: What sort of flower is a "Windblume"? The one who solves this particular enigma will certainly leave their mark on the academic world.
Patchi the Curious: And that's why some researchers have teamed up with adventurers to search for clues as to the "Windblume"'s identity.
Patchi the Curious: Unfortunately, they haven't made much headway.
Patchi the Curious: But we won't give up! We will find that true "Windblume." That is our solemn duty as researchers!
Patchi the Curious: Speaking of which, Mr. Doolan often tells me that we should go to Cape Oath to have a look. What a curious idea. It's not as if there are ruins there or anything...

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Dr. Edith: Indeed. No matter which camp you belong in, remember to enjoy this hard-earned freedom that we possess.

## Talk

Traveler: What camp do you belong to?
Dr. Edith: Me? I don't put much importance on what sort of flower the "Windblume" actually is.
Dr. Edith: I'm a researcher and writer who studies history and culture. I must maintain a neutral stance...
Dr. Edith: ...Opinion is the great enemy of scholarship.
Dr. Edith: But if you find any documents or material of historical value, you're welcome to discuss them with me.

## Talk

Traveler: Asterists?
Dr. Edith: Yes. They are also known as the "Windblume Traditionalists."
Dr. Edith: As opposed to a celebration of romance, they believe that the Windblume Festival is more about commemorating the liberation of Old Mondstadt from tyranny.
Dr. Edith: As far as I'm aware, "Windblume" was possibly once a code word for people who wished to stay in contact and plot resistance in secret...
Dr. Edith: But most people have forgotten this layer of meaning, and so those who feel that this festival should stand for the liberation of Mondstadt have become the minority.
Dr. Edith: Windwheel Asters bear the title of "the visible winds," and so the traditionalists have chosen it to represent them.

## Talk

Dr. Edith: Hmm, you're not celebrating the festival in the city. Are you, by any chance... an Asterist?

## Talk

Myweiss: The Windblume Festival... Hmph, it's that time of the year again, is it?
Myweiss: I had an epiphany when I got divorced, and it was like waking from a long dream: the Windblume Festival should never have been associated with love at all!
Myweiss: Hah, it must have been the scheme of some scheming city merchants. Wouldn't they love to package every festival as something for lovers?
Myweiss: ...People in love have no rational thought to speak of. A little flattery here and there and their wallets open wide.
Myweiss: Whatever the case, I've come to my senses now. These festivals are absolutely meaningless.
Myweiss: ...And if not for the Windblume Festival, would I even have met that man? Hmph...

## Talk

Marla: It's Windblume Festival again... I suppose the Windblumes must be dandelions, after all.
Marla: No matter how strong the wind, it can only blow dandelions away, but it will never cause them to perish.
Marla: But this is just my opinion. But it may be for this reason that dandelions became the symbols of love.
Marla: I hope... I hope that our love will be just as resilient.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Allan: Indeed, see you.

## Talk

Traveler: About the foxes...
Allan: Oh! As Springvale hunters, this is one of our customs.
Allan: Every Windblume Festival, young hunters like me go to Wolvendom to catch foxes.
Allan: When we catch one, we place a wreath of flowers on its head and release it. It's a prayer for finding love in the year ahead...
Allan: Of course, only eligible young hunters like myself participate. Hunters that have already tied the knot, like Draff for example, they're not allowed to take part.
Traveler: Did you catch a fox?
Allan: *sigh* Not even close. Foxes are so hard to catch.
Allan: I didn't catch one last Windblume Festival either. In fact, I nearly injured myself. I remember swearing that this time would be different...
Allan: ...and yet, low and behold, I've been outfoxed again. All I caught were a couple of squirrels.
Allan: That said... I wonder if Miss Sucrose could use her bio-alchemy to change squirrels into foxes?
Allan: I bet she could, haha...
Traveler: So everyone that catches a fox will find love?
Allan: Uh... if you always participate, your chances will increase exponentially...
Allan: ...in that sense, you're bound to bump into the right person eventually...
Allan: ...ahem. Anyway, that's what Draff's always telling us.

## Talk

Allan: Foxes really are too difficult to catch. Just how exactly did the elders manage it...

## Talk

Six-Fingered José: #Hey there, amigo! Are you here to listen to Six-Fingered José's latest composition?
Six-Fingered José: Hehe, fear not. My creations do not disappoint.
Six-Fingered José: When it comes to the Windblume Festival, other bards think love songs. Madre mía, no sense of invention...
Six-Fingered José: I, Six-Fingered José, on the other hand, am not constrained by convention. I wish to eulogize the heroic epics of ages past! The people must remember that this is a day for commemorating heroes and resisting tyrants!
Six-Fingered José: Even if, ahem... I haven't quite finished the last part yet. But once it's complete, it will bring my audience running back!

## Talk

Glory: Huh? I recognize that voice... Traveler?
Glory: The Windblume festivities are in full swing! If you get time, do make sure to roam around. You'll find a very different Mondstadt.
Glory: Even better, if there's someone important to you, you should spend the festival with them. That's where the Windblume feeling truly resides...
Glory: I always used to spend the Windblume Festival with my family and my darling Godwin. How I cherish those sweet times...
Glory: I still don't know how he's getting on... May the winds protect him.

## Talk

Traveler: I'm afraid I don't know either...
Albert: Hmm... I wonder how Barbara-sama will react when she sees our gift...

## Talk

Traveler: A letter?
Albert: Not a bad choice, but if it's just an ordinary letter then it'll be forgotten in no time...
Albert: Hmm, the content has to be different from a normal letter, we need something unforgettable...

## Talk

Traveler: Flowers?
Albert: Flowers... a—as a matter of fact... we at the Barbara Fan Club already have a similar idea.
Albert: Sending flowers the old-fashioned way would be too boring, better to come up with something a little more... unique...

## Talk

Albert: I hope Barbara-sama will like what we've prepared...
Albert: ...*sigh* Traveler, what kind of gift do you think moves people the most?

## Talk

Traveler: Thanks, no need...
Margaret: Aww, don't be shy.

## Talk

Traveler: About the Windblume Festival...
Margaret: The Windblume Festival had a very solemn meaning once...
Margaret: But nowadays, many people believe that it's just a time when they send flowers to others and get their feelings across.
Margaret: Oh? Have someone you'd like to send flowers to, do you? Let me guess... is it me, by any chance?
Margaret: ...Haha, don't be so nervous. I was just joking.

## Talk

Margaret: Since it's the Windblume Festival, would you like to come to The Cat's Tail and have a few drinks?
Margaret: I might even give you some flowers... Hehe.

## Talk

Marvin: Marla, the Windblume Festival is here, and yet, it holds no meaning for me...
Marla: Oh, Marvin, say not that!
Marla: We do not have your father's approval, but this time for lovers is ours also...
Marvin: No, what I mean is that as long as I am with you, every day may as well be the Windblume Festival.
Marla: You're right, Marvin. Our love is like the dandelions that bloom on Cape Oath...
Marvin: Marla, no... Our love should not be a thing so fragile...
Marla: No, I mean to say that though the dandelions are scattered by the wild winds, their lives will not thusly end.
Marla: Dandelion Seeds will fly to distant places, take root, and sprout there... One day, they will cover the length and breadth of Teyvat.
Marvin: Oh, my darling Marla...
Marla: Oh, Marvin! My love...

## Talk

Traveler: I'll leave you to it, then.
Marvin: Yes, alright. Please don't disturb me any further...

## Talk

Traveler: Something on your mind?
Marvin: I... I have a friend. Yes, a friend...
Marvin: He's very taken with a certain girl, but unfortunately, she doesn't come from a particularly wealthy family, so my friend's rather worried that his father will oppose their marriage.
Marvin: Thing is, he truly loves that girl and wants her to be his wife.
Marvin: So I... well, he, is wondering if he should simply come clean with his father...
Traveler: You sure you're talking about a friend?
Marvin: Ahem! *cough* D—Don't you say such scurrilous things...
Marvin: Wait a moment, you haven't been sent by the old man to test me, have you?
Marvin: Hmph, whatever. I said nothing. Just go.
Traveler: I don't think you should...
Marvin: Hmm, is that so...
Marvin: *cough* Ah, uh. I said nothing. You didn't hear anything from me!

## Talk

Marvin: Ugh, should I tell my father or not?
Marvin: No, I suppose it would be best if I didn't. But if I don't tell him, I...

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Luke: *cough* Just go...

## Talk

Traveler: Not going to see the sights?
Luke: Wh—What? I couldn't possibly do that. I've been tasked by a diplomat to guard the embassy. How could I just desert my post?
Luke: *cough* And even if I did want to go for a stroll, I'd have to wait for there to be no one about...
Luke: ...Hey. Don't you even think of getting me to talk. I won't shirk my duties!

## Talk

Traveler: About the Windblume Festival...
Luke: That Viktor keeps saying that this place is as boring as ever, but I can certainly feel the festive atmosphere.
Luke: I'll have you know that I take the greatest pleasure from watching the dejection of those imbeciles who confess their feelings come the festival, only to be rejected. Hah...
Luke: *cough* But back on topic, there's one thing that I don't get...
Luke: ...How did this commemorative festival become a day for lovers, anyway?
Luke: Is this what the people of Mondstadt call "freedom"?

## Talk

Luke: Mondstadt only really gets interesting during festivals, anyway...

## Talk

Grace: Nowadays, no one truly knows what the Windblume is.
Grace: There are some who have judged that the flower simply does not exist, save in legend and song only.
Grace: The way I see it, Windblumes are real so long as there are those who believe in it.
Grace: As to which flower it might be, I think that everyone is free to decide that for themselves.
Grace: I believe that this "freedom to choose" is what Lord Barbatos would have wished for us to have...

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Cyrus: A youngster like you should be more energetic. Don't be cold!

## Talk

Traveler: So, about Stormterror's Lair...
Cyrus: Ah, the Windblume Festival has its origins in Old Mondstadt and the days of the Lord of the Tower. Nowadays, no one knows what the Windblume truly is.
Cyrus: And that is why we explore ancient ruins to uncover the history of resistance in those days. We wish to uncover the truth behind the Windblume.
Cyrus: It is a shame that few young people agree with our views...
Cyrus: If you ask me, the Windblume Festival should be about recounting the era of the Tower of Storms, and the legend of that heroic rebellion, haha!

## Talk

Traveler: About the Windblume Festival...
Cyrus: This is a day to remember those heroes who fought for their freedom. It is said that they once used Windblume as their code word...
Cyrus: As to which flower the Windblume really is? Ah, there are as many views as there are people.
Cyrus: To commemorate the courage and sacrifice of those heroes, we go out to search for clues regarding the Windblume each time the festival rolls back around.
Cyrus: Over many years of searching, I have come to believe more and more that the Windblume is the Windwheel Aster!
Traveler: The Windwheel Aster?
Cyrus: Yes! Don't you think so, too?
Cyrus: Compared to the dandelion, the Windwheel Asters that turn with the wind are the true symbol of Mondstadt's freedom and the soul of the Windblume Festival!
Cyrus: It's just that we lack concrete evidence with which to convince other people...

## Talk

Cyrus: Well then! It's the Windblume Festival. What do you say to going to Stormterror's Lair to search for clues regarding the Windblume?

## Talk

Traveler: See you around.
Lawrence: Happy Windblume Festival!

## Talk

Traveler: About the Windblume Festival...
Lawrence: When we speak of the Windblume Festival, the topic of the Windblume's legend is an inevitable one.
Lawrence: The Windblume Festival has its origins in Old Mondstadt, and people all have their own opinions concerning the true identity of the Windblume.
Lawrence: At the moment, the two most popular must be the "Dandelionite" and "Asterist" schools of thought.
Lawrence: Of course, there are those who believe that neither of these is the true Windblume...
Traveler: About the Dandelionites...
Lawrence: Oh, they believe that the Dandelion is the Windblume. I believe that this is the most mainstream line of thinking.
Lawrence: The Dandelionites believe that the Windblume Festival is a festival for lovers and that they should express their love with the most extravagant sincerity during this time.
Lawrence: Passionate people in love will often travel to Cape Oath and express their feelings for one another amid the billowing Dandelions and profuse Cecilias...
Lawrence: It's all rather romantic, wouldn't you say?
Traveler: Then, about the Asterists...
Lawrence: Those who believe that the Windwheel Aster is the Windblume are certainly not few, but they are not as numerous as those who believe it is the Dandelion.
Lawrence: They believe that the liberation of Old Mondstadt from tyranny should be at the heart of the festival...
Lawrence: ...And that instead of celebrating love, this festival is more suited to remembrance.
Lawrence: If you think about it, this view does have its merits as well...
Lawrence: But it isn't the majority. I guess people just want to have a relaxing, good time during the festive season...

## Talk

Lawrence: Welcome to Mondstadt — make sure you don't miss out on the Windblume Festival.

## Talk

Traveler: I've got other things to attend to.
Goth: I see. Be careful out there.

## Talk

Traveler: About the Windblume Festival...
Goth: Oh, my, if it isn't the Windblume Festival again. The youth of the city have come out to play.
Goth: Haha. I wonder what flower shall be offered up to the Anemo Archon this year? Will it still be a Dandelion?
Goth: When I was a young man, I used to enjoy debating the identity of the Windblume as well. I was quite the dyed-in-the-wool Dandelionite.
Goth: Come to think of it, my wife and I met during the Windblume Festival. It was truly love at first sight...
Goth: *sigh* How the years have gone by since then...

## Talk

Goth: #Excuse me, sir? ...Oh, er, I mean hey there, friend! Why, this work mode of mine... So, care for a chat?

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Bruce: Okay, goodbye!

## Talk

Traveler: What's with the long face?
Bruce: Ah, it's just a shame. Mondstadt is so... well, it's peaceful, but maybe it's too much so.
Bruce: *sigh* If only I'd been born in the days of Old Mondstadt *hic* ...just maybe...
Bruce: How is one to become a hero in such days of peace?
Traveler: By fending Stormterror off, perchance?
Bruce: Well, that certainly was an opportunity, but...
Bruce: Wait. Are you trying to ask me what I was doing during the Stormterror Crisis?
Bruce: I... I'll have you know that I was doing a sweeping survey of all of Mondstadt's safety blind spots!
Bruce: *cough* I mean, it's all water under the bridge now, isn't it? Let's not dredge it up anymore, hahaha...
Traveler: Perhaps dueling a Fatui Harbinger might do the trick?
Bruce: I... well... I mean, Snezhnaya is, after all, an ally of Mondstadt's...
Bruce: I couldn't possibly cause a diplomatic incident just like that, could I?
Bruce: *cough* I guess I should just find some other way to do this...

## Talk

Bruce: Ah, the Windblume Festival... How I envy those heroes who left their mark on history...

## Talk

Donna: I wonder who will have the honor of offering the Windblume to Lord Barbatos this year?
Donna: Ah, I'm so envious. If only I could be the one. Everyone's eyes would be on me...
Donna: (And who knows? Maybe Diluc might notice me if I'm the one offering flowers...)
Donna: (That would be so wonderful... Oh gosh, he's all I can think about, isn't he...)

## Talk

Traveler: I've got to go.
Flora: I hope you'll enjoy yourself during the Windblume festivities.

## Talk

Traveler: About the Windblume Festival...
Flora: The Windblume Festival is an ancient tradition of Mondstadt's. A day for freedom and romance.
Flora: When we speak of Windblume Festival tradition, I suppose it's about giving the "Windblume" in your heart to the person who's the most important to you, hehe.
Flora: As to what flower the Windblume actually is, everyone's got their own opinions.
Flora: Well, that's freedom for you, hehe.

## Talk

Traveler: I'd like to buy some flowers.
Flora: Certainly. We have a fine selection, whether you're looking to give a bouquet to someone or even do some gardening yourself.

## Talk

Flora: Welcome to Floral Whisper. Are you looking to get someone a bouquet? It's the Windblume Festival, after all.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Schulz: Take care, and make sure to enjoy the Windblume Festival!

## Talk

Traveler: About the Windblume Festival and adventurers...
Schulz: A lot of couples will choose to have dates at Cape Oath, but there are some brave adventurer couples who will venture near Stormterror's Lair.
Schulz: That area is simply crawling with monsters, so many adventurers will come here to purchase new equipment...
Schulz: ...After all, if you were to be beaten by monsters in that place, you wouldn't just lose face — you'd be putting your companion in danger, too...
Schulz: So each time the Windblume Festival rolls around, we smiths run brisker business than usual, so I suppose we can be thankful for that.

## Talk

Traveler: What do you have to sell?
Schulz: Take your pick from this selection. All Master's own handiwork, so you won't find any second-rate items here.

## Talk

Schulz: Well, by the looks of you, I'd say you're an adventurer! Not going to stock up on some new equipment?

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Quinn: *hic* A... Another!

## Talk

Traveler: Who's she?
Quinn: Oh, you mean Bea?
Quinn: Dunno what she's thinking.
Quinn: Ever since the Windblume Festival began, she's been bugging me about Cape Oath and heart-shaped Sunsettias...
Quinn: Sunsettias of that kind just don't exist...
Quinn: You'd agree, right? *hic*

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Quinn: *hic* Oh, it's you...
Quinn: That's right. I'm Quinn of Quinn's Fruit. My booth is at...
Quinn: Fresh fruits only at... Quinn's Fruit...
Quinn: Wait... Have we met before?
Quinn: (I'm feeling light-headed...)

## Talk

Quinn: Even if she's a close friend, my resolve won't be shaken... *hic*

## Talk

Beatrice: I'm being serious, there really are heart-shaped Sunsettias around Cape Oath...
Quinn: Bea, your eyes must have been playing tricks on you. Sunsettias just don't grow into that shape. It's against the laws of nature.
Quinn: And even if they did exist, there's no way that they could be sweeter than the ones I'm already selling.
Beatrice: Well, why don't we just go over to Cape Oath to have a look? It won't take long...
Quinn: No. This has to do with my convictions! Using visual attraction to sell fruit is just a cheap trick. I would never do that.
Beatrice: ...Oh come on, why won't you just get it already...
Quinn: Hmm? Come again?
Beatrice: *cough* Uh, nothing... Come on, just consider it for a second!
