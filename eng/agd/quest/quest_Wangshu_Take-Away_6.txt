# Wangshu Take-Away


## Talk 1

Traveler: I'd love to, but I have to get going.
Smiley Yanxiao: Well, have it then. I'll figure something out.

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'll take care of it right now.
Smiley Yanxiao: You have my thanks. But you know Almond Tofu. *You shake it around a bit, and it falls apart*.
Smiley Yanxiao: So be careful, now. *Don't just run, climb or fly around any old how you like*.

## Talk 3

Laid Back Ling'guan: My food should be showing up any minute now...

## Talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: That's right. Ling'guan asked for some Almond Tofu before heading off to Mingyun Village again.
Smiley Yanxiao: It's an odd place, Mingyun Village is.
Smiley Yanxiao: In any case, I hope to get someone who can help me deliver it to her.
