# Delicious Braised Meat

A stewed dish. The rich soup sauce and fragrant meat combine to give off an irresistible aroma, while the scattered vegetables are crisp instead of soft, enriching the flavor of the dish... so much so that people will tuck in despite the intense heat until there is nothing left but the sauce... Wait, why don't we just dip our bread in that?
