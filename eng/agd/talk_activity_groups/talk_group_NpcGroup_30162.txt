Traveler: Aratani's message:

Bulletin Board (Aratani's Message): "...the organizers still managed to reserve enough budget for Ms. Hina. Surely, this is true love? I signed the rental contract immediately."

Traveler: Kimura's message:
Bulletin Board (Kimura's Message): "Recently, Madam Kujou let it slip that the Drumalong Festival on Amakane Island was quite interesting. My coworkers and I got curious, so we stopped by after work to check it out."
Bulletin Board (Kimura's Message): "We were more than a little surprised to find that it was the work of the Arataki Gang, who we evicted from Ritou just a few days ago. So they actually pulled it off, they're hosting a festival. Good for them, I say."
Bulletin Board (Kimura's Message): "Sure, it's a very small-scale festival, but it's a first step. Keep at it, you guys. I hope to see more of this from you in the future."
Bulletin Board (Kimura's Message): "P.S. Roasted Lavender Melon — surprisingly good!"
