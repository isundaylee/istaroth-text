Traveler: Any recommendations?
Ngahue: And as they say, things don't always pan out as you expected. If you don't have a clear destination, you might as well go with the flow — or leave your fate in someone else's hands.
Ngahue: Are there many other wayfinders like me over at my tribe, you ask?
Ngahue: We're not picky about our destination. When we can't decide where to go next, we'll pick up a stick, head over to a Statue of the Pyro Archon, then spin it around on the ground — and whichever way it points is where we go.
Ngahue: Praise be to Lady Haborym! Whenever I follow her guidance, I always learn something new.
