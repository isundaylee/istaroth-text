Traveler: What beat?
Alom: Oh, don't mind me. I'm just playing some intense music in my head â€” the kind that's perfect for forging.
Alom: I'm guessing you can't hear it? It's a pity that I'm tone-deaf as well, or I'd try singing it for you.
Alom: But feel free to stand by and listen to the rhythm of my ironworking. Just think of it as a form of street music.
