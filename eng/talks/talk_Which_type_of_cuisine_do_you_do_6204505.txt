Chef Mao: Which type of cuisine do you do?
Chef Mao: Type of cuisine? Oh, we don't bother ourselves with that kind of thing here.
Chef Mao: Li style and Yue style are all Zhongyuan Chop Suey to us.
Chef Mao: We just concern ourselves with making the most delicious food imaginable using everyday ingredients, universally loved flavors, and truly excellent cooking.
Chef Mao: Food exists to feed the hungry. It's that simple. These people who go putting systems and frameworks around everything are just amateurs that are overcompensating... They don't understand what cooking is really all about.
