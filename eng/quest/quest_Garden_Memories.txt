## Talk 1

Paimon: #How are you feeling {NICKNAME}? Sleep well?
Paimon: We should go find Tighnari... Um... How do you think we should ask him...?

## Talk 2

Paimon: Tighnari—
Tighnari: Shh, keep your voice down.
Tighnari: The Lilac Daphne, a daphne of the genus Thymelaeaceae, has a strong anticonvulsant effect. It can also be made into an anesthetic powder...
Tighnari: Extrapolating from these two data sets, it would be particularly potent against piscine species... Hey, make sure you're getting all this down.
Karkata: Kolu!
Paimon: Karkata!?
Karkata: Kalu! Kalu!
Tighnari: I thought I told you all to keep your voices low. Plants aren't afraid of noise, but your shouting is making my ears ring.
Paimon: Y—You didn't disassemble Karkata?
Tighnari: Why would I do that?
Paimon: But Paimon thought you said, "According to the Akademiya's policies"...
Tighnari: So that's why you two barged in like barbarians at this hour. Fine, I suppose I wasn't clear enough about this yesterday.
Tighnari: What I meant was, according to the Akademiya's policies, all products of research must be destroyed. That's why we can't let the Akademiya discover that place.
Traveler: So the real reason you stayed back was to...
Tighnari: Anyway, the first thing I did was repair Karkata. During my time at the Akademiya, I took an elective course at the Spantamad. Who knew it would prove useful one day.
Tighnari: We then buried Abattouy together. After organizing the research materials, I kept some as a souvenir, most of it was burned to hide the evidence.
Tighnari: I'm not with the Akademiya, so what do their policies have to do with me? On the other hand, I am the Forest Watcher of the Avidya Forest. I have a duty to protect all life in the forest.
Tighnari: All life brought forth in this world has meaning, and Karkata is no exception. If it exists, then it shouldn't be carelessly abandoned or destroyed.
Paimon: Hehe, that's great!
Karkata: Kulilu?
Paimon: Wait, you just said "life form." You recognize Karkata as a true living being now?
Tighnari: The possibility exists is all. It's hard to explain Karkata's efforts to "repair" Abattouy.
Tighnari: Abattouy only left behind a small portion of his research. Who knows how many commands he installed.
Tighnari: Maybe a conflict between all those commands resulted in this sort of behavior.
Tighnari: From a more rigorous perspective, it is impossible to conclude that Karkata is a real life form, but the possibility exists — I am willing to believe in that.
Karkata: Kolu!
Tighnari: By the way, I'm not interested in continuing research on this subject. I'm just letting it hang out here because this place is relatively secluded.
Tighnari: But as things stand now, it wouldn't be a bad idea to make it my research assistant. At the very least, it can record my experiments.
Tighnari: What do you think?
Karkata: Kalu! Kalu!
