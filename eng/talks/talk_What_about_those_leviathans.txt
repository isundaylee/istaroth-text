Traveler: What about those leviathans?
Huixing: I've been fascinated by marine biology since I was a child. Especially those behemoths hidden deep beneath the waves...
Huixing: To be honest, I signed up for this job precisely because I'd heard that Captain Beidou slew Haishan.
Huixing: More's the pity that I haven't had the chance to see a leviathan with my own eyes. I'd really love to see one up close some day.
Huixing: I've also heard some sailors say that they saw something like giant antennae around the Sea of Clouds...
Huixing: ...Is that true or not? Who knows. Perhaps they were just seeing things while dead drunk.
