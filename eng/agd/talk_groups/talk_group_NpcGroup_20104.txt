Bulletin Board (Guest Message): "There's an old saying in Liyue Harbor: 'The cooking mirrors the cook.' Smiley Yanxiao, however, doesn't fit this adage. The man's boorish appearance doesn't match the exquisite flavor of the dishes he creates. Who knows what kind of stories he may have?"
Bulletin Board (Reply): If you like, please leave your name. This way we can act as a go-between and introduce guests to each other.

Bulletin Board (Guest Message): "I sometimes catch a glimpse of a youth standing on top floor, but I've never seen this person before around the inn. Could it be my imagination?"
Bulletin Board (Reply): Our inn is situated in the Dihua Marsh, a region of mist and mysticism. What's strange about seeing a good omen here? We thank guests for their understanding.

If you don't come by today, you might miss out! ...Please, I'm but a simple traveling merchant trying to make a living in this difficult trade, without even a roof over my head. I hope you may grace my wares with patronage, and even make friends! —Zhonglin"
Bulletin Board (Another Note): "Your child misses you. Come back to the village to visit when you can."

Bulletin Board (Sailor's Message): "My sister and I haven't seen each other for many years. She has become a famous captain, while I am still but a mediocre deckhand living a humdrum life... When we meet each other again, I wonder if she will still treat me as she did before?"
Bulletin Board (Reply): Life is unpredictable. If you two meet again and greet each other warmly like nothing has changed, then this would certainly be a joyous occasion. But if you are disappointed, then just accept this as one's lot in life. It's nothing to lament or cry about. Relax...

Bulletin Board (Guest Message): "Dear wife of the innkeeper, may I ask your name? Isn't it lonely to come live here so far from Mondstadt? May you join me under the moonlight for a chat?"
Bulletin Board (Reply): Sorry to disappoint you, but it's more apt to say that my wife is the innkeeper here. She has already asked me to gaze at the moon and stars together with her tonight, and she is not one to share. Please do not take offense.

Bulletin Board (Guest Message): "Thank you for the stay. My scholar friend of Sumeru and I talked happily into the night, from debating the principles of the world and elements to recounting stories of our hometowns, famous specialties, culture, and nearly every topic one could think of — reminiscing like this really makes one's heart swell with emotion."

Bulletin Board (Guest Message): "Strange... Yesterday I caught sight of a prince from a faraway land checking in, but this morning he was already gone and his room empty."
Bulletin Board (Guest Message): "I wanted to make friends with him, seeing his impressive appearance, but didn't expect him to leave in such a rush... what a pity!"
Bulletin Board (Reply): Don't fret! Before he left, the prince said he had booked a room in the city at the Baiju Guesthouse. You can go to Liyue Harbor to look for him.

Bulletin Board (Guest Message): "Of course on my rare half-day off from work I again end up at the Wangshu Inn, sipping Morning Dew and enjoying some Qingxin."

Bulletin Board (Guest Message): "Can the owner please refrain from putting chili peppers in Ganyu's food. She often has to stay up late and has a sensitive stomach, which spicy food does absolutely no favors for."
Bulletin Board (Guest Message): "Ganyu is so busy that she does not often get a good night's sleep. Today is her day off, however, so she finally has a chance to catch up on some sleep. Can the owner please make her bed extra soft and comfy for her?"
Bulletin Board (Guest Message): "Yaoyao thanks and salutes the owner."
Bulletin Board (Reply): We are happy to accommodate you during your stay. If I may add, are you sure it is Ganyu who is taking care of you, and not the other way around?

Bulletin Board (Guest Message): "Today in the mountains I ran into a child I have admired for a long time. But alas, I could not approach her, my heart filled with anxiety and unease."
Bulletin Board (Guest Message): "It's common to become obsessed with the apple of one's eye... pampering them, worrying about them, and thinking about their well-being."
Bulletin Board (Guest Message): "That child was destined to wander far from home, her body giving off an aura not belonging to this world. I wanted to force myself by her side, but this would surely only lead to disappointment..."
Bulletin Board (Guest Message): "Thus I suppressed this urge and kept at a distance as I followed her across mountains and fields. I kept watch out of concern that something may happen to her, and quietly helped make paths for her through rough terrain..."
Bulletin Board (Guest Message): "However, each time I see her with someone else I become very angry... How can I continue to allow this kind of betrayal?"
Bulletin Board (Reply): Dearest guest, please relax. Our inn has some top-notch teas that can dispel your worries. This kind of matter should not be rushed, so take it easy and do what makes you happy.
