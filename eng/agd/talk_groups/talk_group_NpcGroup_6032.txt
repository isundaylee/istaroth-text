Traveler: You assist the referees?
Yokina: Yes, I'm a photographer for the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame.
Yokina: Aside from media coverage and record-keeping, my photos are also sometimes referred to when the referees make tricky decisions.
Yokina: The arena can get quite chaotic, and it can sometimes be difficult to tell exactly what happened.
Yokina: Making the right call can be challenging when all each person has to go on is what they saw, so my photos are a game-changer.

Traveler: What if you didn't get a picture in either?
Yokina: That would be the trickiest set of circumstances. Perhaps the only option would be to allow the match to run into extra time.
Yokina: But that kind of thing doesn't happen very often. Aside from the fact that there are many referees presiding over each match, we've also got the Pyro Archon watching every moment of the action from up high.

Traveler: Could I ask you to take a picture for me?
Yokina: No can do, I'm sorry to say.
Yokina: Fans have asked me before if I'd sell my photos so they could go get contestants' autographs, but I always refuse. I don't want people to start reselling them for extortionate prices.
Yokina: Plus, given that I actually have to assist the referees at times, I don't accept private commissions — all in the interest of fairness, you understand.
