# Portended Fate


## Talk 1

Eide: Caribert...! Caribert...! Where are you?

## Talk 2

Traveler: Eide's out of control. I have to end this fight...

## Talk 3

Eide: It's his scarf... he dropped it.
Eide: Looks like we're going the right way. Come on.

## Talk 4

Eide: Curses... Forest Rangers.
Forest Ranger: Hey! Who are you? We haven't seen you around here before. What's your business here?
Eide: Have you seen a hilichurl? A hilichurl should have come past this way... have you seen it?
Forest Ranger: I asked you first... Don't make this more difficult than it needs to be!
Eide: I said... have you seen... a HILICHURL!!!
Traveler: Eide...
Forest Ranger: Hey, whoa... Look, Sir, there's no need to get so worked up...
Forest Ranger: There are hilichurls everywhere, what's the big deal? We see plenty of them out here...
Ranger Guard: Exactly. Matter of fact, we just took out a few of them back there. Those dumb boneheads...
Eide: You... you...!
Eide: Forest Ranger scum! You spawn of The Seven are all the same! I'll have your heads if you so much as laid a finger on Caribert!
Forest Ranger: You...! You're raving mad! You've got some gall, coming here to our nation, insulting the Forest Rangers!
Eide: Curse you all, Forest Rangers...
Traveler: Stop it, Eide!
Traveler: Stop. Or the Forest Rangers and I will have to make you.
Black Screen Text: Both sides calm down for now, thanks to your urging...
Ranger Guard: I don't get it. Why make such a huge fuss over a few hilichurls...? It makes no sense...
Eide: You...
Eide: He'd only just regained his mind. How could you do this to him...
Eide: So tell me, Forest Rangers... Did you really spare none of them? Did you really take out every last hilichurl you saw?
Ranger Guard: Geez, you're really not gonna let this go... Fine, you weirdo. If you must know, I happened to cross paths with a solitary hilichurl when I left the team to, uh... use the toilet.
Ranger Guard: I was frightened at first, but it didn't seem to have any interest in me at all. It was just bumbling along, in... that direction. So I left it alone.
Traveler: There's still hope!
Traveler: That could well have been Caribert!
Eide: Yes! Wonderful... Wonderful. Let's go! We have to find him!
Forest Ranger: Wait, you're leaving? Not even a "Thanks for the info, goodbye"?

## Talk 5

Eide: Curse you all, Forest Rangers...
Traveler: Stop it, Eide!
Traveler: Stop. Or the Forest Rangers and I will have to make you.
Black Screen Text: Both sides calm down for now, thanks to your urging...

## Talk 6

Caribert: ...
Eide: Caribert!
Traveler: We found him!
Eide: Caribert, stop! It's me! It's Papa!
Eide: Whatever you saw, it was... it was all a trick! An illusion!
Eide: I told you, we're in a fairytale world now, nothing here is real... Please, Caribert, come back... it's time to go back!
Caribert: ...
Eide: Caribert?
Traveler: He's not responding...
Eide: How could this happen? He regained his mind... He must be able to hear me, surely?
Eide: Come, Caribert, we have to go home now... Papa's here to take you home, alright?
Traveler: Hold on, something's not right with him...
Caribert: ...
Traveler: What has that strange power done to him?
Traveler: He's relapsed...

## Talk 7

Eide: ...Haha, I see, I understand now...
Eide: Finally, it all makes sense...
Traveler: (What happened... did I faint? I remember Caribert taking his mask off, but then...)
Eide: Aha, Traveler, you're awake... Finally, we can rejoice together!
Eide: Wait, no... Why am I still calling you "Traveler"? I have known your true identity for some time now.
Traveler: What do you mean, "true identity"?
Eide: Hehehe... I suspected it was you from the beginning! I had to talk to you to be sure.
Traveler: But I've never met you...
Eide: Oh, of course you haven't. With your status? You can hardly be expected to know all of us.
Eide: In any case... I've been using a fake name this entire time. "Eide" is the name of a servant I once had...
Eide: My real name is Chlothar...
Eide: ...Chlothar Alberich.
Traveler: Alberich!?
Eide: You saw it too, didn't you? Unmistakable... The power inside Caribert and the power of the one you call a "Sinner," it was one and the same...
Eide: I am positive now... it's the power of the Abyss, isn't it?
Eide: At long last, I have seen it with my own eyes...
Traveler: I didn't see clearly...
Eide: That is no business of yours!
Traveler: ...
Eide: A sinner... Yes, salvation for a sinner can only come from a sinner...
Eide: Caribert did not deserve his fate, but now... It's wonderful — he will be able to weave his own destiny anew.
Eide: Born into abject sorrow, he shall now become...
Eide: ..."The Loom of Fate."
Traveler: (There's that term again... the "Loom of Fate"...)
Traveler: You're right about this being from the Abyss...
Eide: ...
Eide: ...Sinister? ...Dangerous?
Eide: I never imagined that you, of all people, would deny the Abyss... How ridiculous!
Eide: We once believed that you would bring new strength and hope to Khaenri'ah.
Eide: To us, you were the Abyss... A wondrous mystery far beyond our imagination and comprehension...
Eide: ...And the one who controls the Abyss can control everything!
Eide: We yearned for that future. We looked to you to take us there.
Eide: But what did you bring us instead?
Eide: #O {M#Princess}{F#Prince}... of Khaenri'ah?
Traveler: But the Abyss is sinister and dangerous...
Traveler: What happened to Caribert?
Traveler: You can't be!?
Traveler: Eide, are you okay?

## Talk 8

Paimon: ...You're awake! Oh, thank goodness, you're awake!
Paimon: #Paimon was worried sick! ...Uh, {NICKNAME}? {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: ...
Dainsleif: What happened while you were unconscious?
Dainsleif: I checked the Ley Lines nearby. It appears that the Abyss tampered with them, and they've been in turmoil ever since...
Dainsleif: Information and memories flow within the Ley Lines... What did you witness?
Traveler: The founder of the Abyss Order... Alberich...
Dainsleif: You mean Chlothar Alberich?
Dainsleif: After founding the Abyss Order, his faith in the Abyss led him to do a great many things.
Dainsleif: But the curse of immortality continued to torment his body and mind, and in the end, neither his faith nor the Abyss he worshiped could save him.
Dainsleif: After a hundred years, he lost his mind completely, and was never seen again.
Dainsleif: Yet his dark legacy lived on... The Defiled Statue that we encountered previously was just one perverse product of his use of Abyssal power during his life.
Traveler: And despite that...
Dainsleif: #You could say that. {M#She}{F#He} wouldn't be the Abyss Order's {M#Princess}{F#Prince} otherwise.
Paimon: Are you alright? You have a troubled look on your face... What happened?
Traveler: I... have a story to tell you.
Dainsleif: ...
Black Screen Text: Your words send Dainsleif deep into thought...
Dainsleif: #So, you saw {M#her}{F#his} memories from centuries ago... through your own eyes. It all but defies belief.
Dainsleif: Still, as I'd suspected, the notion of the "Loom of Fate" did indeed rear its head during that time...
Dainsleif: And it seems closely connected to Chlothar Alberich's son, Caribert, and what happened to him...
Dainsleif: #And yet your {M#sister}{F#brother} never breathed a word of this incident to me... I wonder, was that the moment that {M#she}{F#he} decided to go down this path...?
Traveler: I also wish that I could know...
Traveler: But one thing is clear:
Dainsleif: Indeed. Clearly, this series of events sparked a long period of deep contemplation. This... was where it all began.
Traveler: Yes... Oh, I almost forgot...
Dainsleif: What is it?
Traveler: I need to know what lies buried in this field.
Paimon: The field? What does that have to do with anything...
Dainsleif: ...You mean, here? Well, let's start digging and see.
Black Screen Text: After some time, you and Dainsleif discover what is buried in the field...
Paimon: ...You scared the dook outta Paimon. D—Did you re-bury them yet?
Traveler: We're done. You can open your eyes now.
Dainsleif: A male and female skeleton, buried together...
Dainsleif: Interestingly, the male skeleton appears to have been interred much later... and it's holding a silk scarf in its hand.
Dainsleif: But what does this mean? And how did you know that there were bodies buried here?
Traveler: I think that the bones of the man...
Dainsleif: What? That's impossible...
Dainsleif: Unless... Chlothar Alberich finally found a way to rid himself of the curse.
Traveler: Perhaps he did...
Dainsleif: ...
Dainsleif: This all raises far too many questions... I need time to think. And to search my memories for some missing pieces...
Dainsleif: We should part ways here.
Paimon: Huh? You're just gonna leave? Why? You could come with us, y'know.
Dainsleif: It's better that we split up for now... I think that "he" might have seen you.
Paimon: Who's "he"?
Traveler: You mean...
Dainsleif: Yes. I have my suspicions as to his identity, but I need to confirm some other details before I can be sure.
Dainsleif: If the time is right, I will tell you when we next meet.
Paimon: #But what do you mean that he "saw" {NICKNAME}? How is that possible?
Traveler: It was just a memory...
Dainsleif: I fear that while these things would limit anyone else... they are no obstacle to him.
Paimon: What? Why? ...What IS he?
Traveler: A "Sinner"...
Dainsleif: Alright, let's leave it there. Get some rest... Goodbye.
Paimon: There goes Dain. And just like that, it's back to being the two of us again, huh?
Traveler: Oh, Paimon... one more thing:
Paimon: Hmm? What is it?
Traveler: ...I missed you.
Paimon: Huh!?
Traveler: It all happened hundreds of years in the past...
Traveler: The voice that I heard inside my head?
Traveler: Belong to Chlothar Alberich.
Traveler: There's something I need to check.
Traveler: ...This was not a happy memory.
Traveler: #What {M#she}{F#he} thought about all of this.
Traveler: #My {M#sister}{F#brother} ultimately sided with him, didn't {M#she}{F#he}?
Traveler: What happened to him?

## Talk 9

Caribert: Do you live in the fairytale world as well? My name's Caribert, nice to meet you...
