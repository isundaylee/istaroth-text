Traveler: A little creature?
Kano Nana: If you meet a creature... I mean a girl who's about this tall, please let me know.
Kano Nana: This girl's name is Sayu. She is a little ninja from the Kamisato Clan of the Yashiro Commission. She's very, very cute.
Kano Nana: But she doesn't like to work and hides away to take naps all the time. She said that she'll grow taller this way...
Kano Nana: Sayu has an aptitude for ninjutsu, so she's very elusive. She can even be a bigger headache than Heizou...
Kano Nana: I really hope I can find her soon. Then I'll have some time to ask Lady Yae for the latest novels...
