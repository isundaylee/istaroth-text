Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Collei: Actually, I was wondering about inviting you to go camping with me.
Collei: My mood's been pretty good these past few days, and I just finished an exam. Master Tighnari says I should take some time to relax.
Collei: We should find a nice wide open place to enjoy the scenery, and bring some ingredients to cook over the campfire.
Traveler: When are we leaving?
Collei: Um... I was thinking maybe we could leave today?
Traveler: Today!?
Collei: Um... well actually, I only handed in my exam paper so far. Master Tighnari said he'll mark it when he's got a spare moment...
Collei: But if I don't get a good mark, I'll have to start revising again right away.
Collei: And you said you were up for it, so I didn't want to let this opportunity go by...
Collei: Then again, now I think about it, even though we could find some ingredients on the ground, we'll need some time to think of a good location.
Collei: And if we're going out into the wild, there's a whole lot of other things we need to prepare for, too...
Traveler: How about we just go camping here?
Collei: Huh? Here? ...Actually, yeah, I never thought of that!
Collei: Plenty of open space, a great view, and no danger...
Traveler: Consider it the trial run before we go camping for real.
Collei: Alright! Ah, this is such a good idea. You're so good at this kind of thing.
Collei: Wait! Are you sure Tubby won't mind?
Traveler: Shall I get ready?
