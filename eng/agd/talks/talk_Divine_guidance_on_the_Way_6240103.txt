Traveler: Divine guidance on the Way?
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: Precisely! As the saying goes, "That which the sages sought first in vain, they found from the hermit when they sought it again"!
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: What makes the guidance divine, you ask? All guidance is divine when it comes from an adeptus such as myself! And what is the Way of which I speak? It is a martial art form without peer in all the world.
Traveler: Sounds like a load of mumbo-jumbo...
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: How dare you display such flagrant irreverence towards an Adeptus of the Way!
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: So be it! If you insist on squandering your chance to learn the secrets of the Way from me, go and spend the rest of your life regretting it!
Traveler: What d'you teach here then?
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: So I teach— No! The Way of the Adeptus cannot be conversed about with such nonchalance!
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: I am not in the business of "teaching," but "imparting," and I am quite insistent about that.
Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz: If you must know — for a fee of seven thousand Mora per month, I will impart to you the secrets of harnessing your martial faculties. Your feet and your fists shall fly with the force of a comet and the ease of a butterfly!
