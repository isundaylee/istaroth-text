Traveler: So how is the pay calculated?
Shikun: Nah, it's not, we're way too close to worry about formalities like that!
Shikun: After we helped them out, the neighbors treated us to dinner and we had a few drinks together! That counts as payment!
Shikun: Yeah, I even moved a bunch of clothes and books for Deyin a couple of days ago, and he made some killer egg soup!
Shikun: If you have some time, you should go chat with him and let him tell you stories about Chenyu Vale!
