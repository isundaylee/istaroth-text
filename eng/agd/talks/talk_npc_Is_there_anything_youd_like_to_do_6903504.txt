Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Qiqi: I... want to get a pet finch.
Qiqi: Then we can... look after it here... together.
Qiqi: If you find some seeds, I can feed it.
Qiqi: We can build a nest... so the wind and rain won't disturb it.
Qiqi: I will take it on walks during the daytime... and it can stretch with me before bedtime.
Traveler: You'd be like the finch's older sister.
Qiqi: Yes! I will be a good... role model.
Qiqi: I'll protect it... and you too.
Traveler: And I'll make sure to look after you both, too.
Qiqi: Mm-hmm!
Qiqi: You, Qiqi, and a nice little finch...
Qiqi: *sigh* That would be quite nice...
Traveler: Thanks, Qiqi, counting on you!
Traveler: It'd be sure to grow up strong and healthy.
