# Wangshu Take-Away


## Talk 1

Traveler: I've got something else to do.
Smiley Yanxiao: Well, have it then. I'll figure something out.

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'll deliver it right now.
Smiley Yanxiao: I'm counting on you, then. This Stir-Fried Filet requires careful treatment, so avoid any unnecessary complications.
Smiley Yanxiao: So, *don't touch any weird elements while you're out there, and don't move too fast*.

## Talk 3

Laid Back Ling'guan: Should be here any moment now...

## Talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: Aye, you heard right. Ling'guan ordered some Stir-Fried Filet before heading northwest.
Smiley Yanxiao: If it isn't too much trouble, deliver it to her while it's hot, will you?
Smiley Yanxiao: If you meet with an accident along the way, come back here and I'll make you another serving.
