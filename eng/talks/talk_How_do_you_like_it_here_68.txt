Traveler: How do you like it here?
Raiden Shogun: It's much livelier here than the plane of pure silence and tranquility that I'm used to.
Traveler: Will it be difficult for you to get used to this place?
Raiden Shogun: No, not at all.
Raiden Shogun: Clamor and commotion are strictly external, my inner being shall remain tranquil as ever.
Traveler: Okay, that's good.
Raiden Shogun: Thank you for your concern.
Raiden Shogun: ...
Raiden Shogun: Will you remain here a while longer?
Raiden Shogun: With you by my side, though our mouths stay silent, my heart is at peace.
Raiden Shogun: Your companionship... This is one change that I shall not contest.
Traveler: Would you like to join in the action?
Raiden Shogun: Such lively activities stand in direct contrast to the notion of Eternity. I'm afraid I'll have to consider it further.
