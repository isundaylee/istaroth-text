## Talk

Traveler: How are the sales of the new volumes looking?
Onodera: Very good, I'd say. The readers have come away satisfied, right down to the last person.
Onodera: But now that I think about it, I'm still a little scared, haha...
Onodera: If it wasn't for your help, I'm pretty sure that I would have messed up somewhere...

Traveler: Keep your chin up!
Onodera: True, you make a good point. I've got to become a more reliable person!
Onodera: Oh yeah, just the other day, I told Lady Yae everything that happened, and she seemed rather... inordinately pleased.
Onodera: She even told me, "Why, young Onodera, it's because of people like you that the Irodori Festival is so interesting!"
Onodera: I can't help but feel that there's some other meaning to that...
