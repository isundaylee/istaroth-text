# Delicious Tricolor Dango

A soft, glutinous snack. The luster of these dango is like the falling morning dew, and it gives off the feeling of lush flowers and branches. When watching the flowers, eating this snack gives one a sense of happiness, as if the whole following year shall be as gorgeous as the falling flowers before them.
