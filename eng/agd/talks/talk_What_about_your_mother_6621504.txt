Traveler: What about your mother?
Atzi: She's a doctor, so she's super busy! She's often out working, and she even brings delicious food back home.
Atzi: But whenever she's not out, she takes me to see Granny Itztli...
Atzi: Mom always brings Granny Citlali cabbages, Grainfruit, and herbs. After that, she gets Granny to teach me some classes and leave me some homework...
Atzi: Granny's homework is always so hard... Y'know what? Come to think of it, it's best that adults stay busy!
