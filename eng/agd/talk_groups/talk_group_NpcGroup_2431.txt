Traveler: So, have you found the adepti?
Pan Guan'er: Not yet. No adeptus has come to give me back my axe, either. How strange...
Pan Guan'er: I did in fact pick up a sword.
Pan Guan'er: But... I don't know how to use swords! Did the adeptus get something wrong?
Pan Guan'er: Well, whatever. Why don't you take this sword with you? I still need to wait for my axe to come back...

Traveler: You lost something?
Pan Guan'er: Yes. I'm a lumberjack, I work in this area. But I lost my axe — again.
Pan Guan'er: Maybe I misplaced it when I stopped to take a break?
Pan Guan'er: But if it's genuinely lost, then as the legend says, an adeptus should bring it back to me...
Pan Guan'er: If that's the case... Maybe it would be quicker if I went looking for the adeptus instead?
