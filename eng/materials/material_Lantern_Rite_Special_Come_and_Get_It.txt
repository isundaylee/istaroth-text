# Lantern Rite Special Come and Get It

Traditional cuisine made to celebrate Lantern Rite. There is no great refinement in the making of this food, and it appears in Liyue often during festival season. Whenever this dish is served up, the person at the head of the table will invite everyone to dig in, saying "Come on, eat, eat," hence the name.
