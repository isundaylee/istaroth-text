# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Kirara: Sure! Is there anything you'd like to ask me?
Traveler: Can you tell me more about your job as a courier?
Kirara: You couldn't have chosen a better topic!
Kirara: Delivering a high volume of packages isn't a problem for me, youkai's legs are naturally fast after all.
Kirara: But maintaining a good rating with clients isn't nearly as easy. Most people don't even bother to leave a review, good or bad... I guess it's human nature to avoid doing anything that isn't absolutely necessary?
Kirara: Yet, despite that... I've noticed that when I'm a cat, passers-by always stop and stare at me like they have nothing better to do, even if I'm just sunbathing. But as soon as I turn into a human being, suddenly no one has two minutes to spare to leave a good rating. Weird, isn't it?
Traveler: Do you ever get tired from working?
Kirara: Hmm... depends. Sometimes, I guess â€” especially leading up to festivals, when the express packages start piling up like a bunch of Zaytun Peaches about to burst...
Kirara: If only my youkai powers were stronger... maybe then I'd be able to run even faster. Hehe, or maybe even split myself into a ton of different clones!
Traveler: So one nekomata with two tails...
Kirara: Argh, stop with the math! I'm gonna tie my tails in knots trying to keep up!
Traveler: You sound really passionate about your work.
Kirara: Why wouldn't I be? After all, this job has allowed me to visit and find my place in all kinds of human cities!
Kirara: You could say that taking my job seriously is my way to show my gratitude!
Traveler: Would become three nekomata with six tails...
Traveler: How's the work going?
Kirara: Hehe, you're looking at the only gold level courier of Komaniya Express!
Kirara: My boss even wanted to give me a special bonus! I told them though that I'd still prefer more paid-for international vacations, uh, I mean, opportunities to deliver international packages.
