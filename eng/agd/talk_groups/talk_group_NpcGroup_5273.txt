Traveler: How have you been?
Chaussivert: Fantastic. No one's secretly trying to get rid of me, or trying to blow up Lumidouce Harbor.
Chaussivert: And people have stopped engaging in shady practices like bribery, fraud, or backstabbing.
Chaussivert: Peace has been restored to Lumidouce Harbor. Not bad!
Chaussivert: And I played a big role in it all, too. Even better!

Traveler: About Loillier...
Chaussivert: I specifically went looking for him later, but the scoundrel had already made off with everything. The house was totally empty, not even a piece of paper left behind.
Chaussivert: Hmph... Greedy yet cowardly. He wouldn't dare do anything to me, not unless he had a powerful patron.
Chaussivert: A pity I can't find him now, or I'd show him my special kind of hospitality.

Traveler: Aren't you thinking about hiring more people?
Chaussivert: Yes... I'm seriously considering that, and discussing with Lemarcq.
Chaussivert: However... Haha, maybe that shameless Pattyn was right. You won't make a fortune by working with me. I doubt many people would want to get involved.
Chaussivert: But no matter what, I won't take dirty money. Otherwise... I wouldn't be able to sleep at night.
