# The Snowy Past


## Talk 1

Albedo: From the entrance, the footprints go that way.
Paimon: Grr, that thieving... thief!

## Talk 2

Albedo: The footprints lead up there.
Paimon: So they scaled the cliff? Okay, after them!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Footprints on the snow are so hard to notice... It's so easy to lose track completely...
Albedo: That's why we have to hurry.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Huh? The footprints stop here?
Albedo: Our thief must have jumped from the cliff. Get your wind glider ready. We're going down.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Hey, this one's not bad!

## Talk 6

Paimon: Huh, this stuff looks kinda... lackluster... is that because of the impurities, like Albedo was talking about?

## Talk 7

Albedo: I've been absorbed in my research lately and haven't attended to the dusting... It's due for a cleaning.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Wow, so much clutter... We're not gonna find the key here, surely?

## Talk 9

Paimon: Uh oh, we got company!
