Traveler: Huh?
Maziar: My aunt runs a hotel. There's only one hotel in Caravan Ribat, so it should be easy to find.
Maziar: I used to live in the city with my parents, but I really didn't have a thing for school, and it was annoying to be pushed by them every day. So I came here to work with my aunt.
Maziar: I learned a lot with her, and am getting more skilled at bargaining with vendors than ever.
Maziar: This is something you'll never learn from the Akasha Terminal.
