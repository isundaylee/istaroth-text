Traveler: Are you planning to move into the city?
Banka: Me? Well, I'm fine right where I am.
Banka: It's Kumar, my younger brother, that I'm talking about here. Now, it's pretty much a fact that the Dendro Archon has cured everyone suffering from Eleazar, Kumar being one of them.
Banka: And now that he's well, I suppose it's about time that he made some plans for the future.
Banka: He's got a long list of things that he wants to try, but I've got a feeling that going to the city to study might open a better path for him than staying here or going out on adventures.
Banka: If he can become a researcher or something of the order, he won't have to want for anything again.
