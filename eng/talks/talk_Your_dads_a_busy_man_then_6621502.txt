Traveler: Your dad's a busy man, then?
Atzi: Not at all! All he does is walk around our encampment with his chest puffed out.
Atzi: And he always tells me not to make too much noise around the Saurians. Hmph! I bet he just wants me to stay at home and do homework all day, every day. That sure would be easier for him, huh...
Atzi: Hmph, well if he thinks I'll play ball with not playing ball, he's got another thing coming! I'm gonna go play hide-and-seek with the baby Saurians!
Atzi: But it's so hard to beat Iktomisaurs at hide-and-seek... If only there were some Tepetlisaurs nearby instead.
