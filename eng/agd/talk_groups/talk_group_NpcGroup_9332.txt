Eula: Why don't we take some time to review the enemy threat and fine-tune our plan of attack?
Eula: In my experience, the more thorough the plan, the sweeter the satisfaction when it all finally comes together.

Eula: Even if an enemy is strong enough to fend me off for today, that doesn't faze me. Sooner or later, they will get their comeuppance.

Eula: What will become of the wicked aristocracy after being ousted by the valiant knights?
Eula: Will they flee into the dark woods while the nation rejoices, wallowing in self-pity? Or will they beg for mercy, only to skulk in some corner of the city, sharpening their knives?
Eula: Fairytales never answer these questions. They just assume that eternal peace is a given once the villains have been defeated.
