Pepe: Guess what? This guy I know from the village has turned really lazy all of a sudden. He just lies there sleeping, all day long...

## Talk

Pepe: Tee-hee, do I do a good impression of Uncle Draff or what?

Traveler: What are you up to?
Pepe: Running practice!
Pepe: Uncle Draff says if you wanna be a hunter, the first step is being able to chase your prey. I can already catch up with the cats in the neighborhood!
Pepe: But I'm still nowhere near as good as my dad. He runs so fast, he can catch anything!

## Talk

Traveler: Where's your dad?
Pepe: He went to chase a huuuge boar. It'll be ages and ages before he gets back.
Pepe: I wanted to go and help my dad with the hunt, but Uncle Draff said I'm not big enough yet, I wouldn't be strong enough to be a hunter, and it would only make things worse if I went.
Pepe: So I wanna grow up as fast as I can, learn how to hunt, and then I'll be able to help dad!

Traveler: That's the spirit! Good luck, bye!
Pepe: I'm gonna be a great hunter one day, I just know it!
Pepe: Then I can go help dad finally catch that boar!
