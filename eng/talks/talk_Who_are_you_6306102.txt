Traveler: Who are you?
Mikawa Akane: I'm Mikawa Akane, manager of the Royal Hot Springs. I'm in charge of serving and arranging accommodations for the lords from the Shogunate who are here for the hot springs.
Mikawa Akane: Traveler, you must have just arrived in Inazuma. I can tell you stories about the Inazuma hot springs, if you'd like.
