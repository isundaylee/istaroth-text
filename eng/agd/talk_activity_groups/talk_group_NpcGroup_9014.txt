## Talk

Barbara: #Hi there, Traveler!
Barbara: Seeing you so full of life puts my mind at rest.

## Talk

Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Barbara: Oh, I love it here!
Barbara: The scenery here is so different from Mondstadt's. I find it really refreshing.
Barbara: And, here I can sing at the top of my voice without having to worry if I'm disturbing anyone! It's the best way to practice.
Traveler: Surely no one would ever consider your sweet voice a disturbance?
Barbara: Ah...
Barbara: It sure is nice of you to say that! But, uh... still, I always need to make sure I'm being considerate of other people.
Barbara: Anyway, I'm really happy you invited me here!
Barbara: I think I'd like to stay here a little longer.
Traveler: That's great!
Barbara: Yeah... I'm just so happy that you invited me to come here.

## Talk

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Barbara: Oh, sure!
Barbara: Hehe...
Traveler: What's with that smile...
Barbara: Oh, I just realized that I haven't chatted with a friend like this in a long time.
Barbara: I just feel so blessed all of a sudden.
Traveler: Seems like you're easy to please.
Barbara: Uhh... Is that so...
Barbara: Well, maybe... but it's not such a bad thing.
Barbara: The easier you find it to receive joy, the more energy you have to share that joy with other people.
Barbara: Ahh... please, no need to shower me with compliments...
Barbara: Only with constructive criticism can we grow, right...?
Traveler: It's because you're always putting other people first.
Barbara: Of course I do, that's what I'm supposed to do!
Barbara: I've always had so many people looking out for me. I just want to do all that is within my power to repay their kindness.
Traveler: You are every bit as wonderful as people say.
Traveler: Have you suddenly remembered something amusing?

## Talk

Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Barbara: Oh, I've been practicing a new song recently.
Barbara: But I'm still trying to iron out a few details...
Barbara: When I repeat the chorus, should I go up a half step? I can't decide... And I think there's room for improvement with the dance routine, but I'm not sure...
Barbara: If it's no trouble, I'd really appreciate it if you could watch my performance and give me your suggestions.
Traveler: You have my unconditional support.
Barbara: Thank you...!
Barbara: Um... Please don't laugh at me if there are parts that still need practicing.
Barbara: I've thought about this a lot of times in the past, but it's taken me this long to finally pluck up the courage to perform for you at such close distance.
Barbara: If you laughed at me, there'd be nowhere I could run from my embarrassment...
Traveler: Don't worry. I won't laugh.
Barbara: Whew... Okay.
Barbara: Then...
Barbara: Let the show begin!
Traveler: I believe in you, and you should believe in yourself as well.
Traveler: It would be my honor.

## Talk

Barbara: Such a tidy room... It reminds me of the Knights of Favonius' guest room.
Barbara: Now, if only it had a few cute decorations, it would be even more cozy...
Barbara: Let's go buy some when you have the time!

## Talk

Barbara: The wind blowing through this park brings with it a familiar scent.
Barbara: This would be the perfect spot to rest on a nice afternoon, listening to the sounds of the water... It's just so relaxing.
Barbara: Thank you! I love this place.
