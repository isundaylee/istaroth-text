# An Ode to Yonder City


## Talk 1

Qingzhou: How unexpected...
Traveler: What's unexpected?
Qingzhou: I originally wished to enter the mountains to seek the adepti, my liege. Yet now Liyue seems to shed its skin with every passing day — do poets such as I have any reason not to write a few poems of leisure?
Qingzhou: Still, though my heart is burdened with words, they are too scattered, and lack a central spirit of poetry to rally around. I was just puzzling over the matter.
Traveler: Wh—Whatever do you mean, my liege?
Qingzhou: Ah, but you are no poet. It is normal if you do not understand. The flow of a poet's words is a mystery unto itself.
Qingzhou: But other than the words, the poetic spirit itself is fraught with many meanings. Meanings that I shall explain to you in detail, in exchange, perhaps, for a little favor...
Traveler: H—Hold your horses. What favor?
Qingzhou: Ahaha, do not fret, my liege. It's like this...
Qingzhou: I merely feel that if I am to offer up a poem for Liyue as it is today, then I must draw inspiration from the city itself.
Qingzhou: You are well-traveled, my liege, and must surely be learned in many fields, including that of social grace. Perhaps, then, you could go to Liyue Harbor in my stead to gather data—
Qingzhou: No, no. Perhaps the intentionality shall render the exercise mediocre yet. And moreover, you are... Ahem, please allow me to marshal my thoughts.
Qingzhou: How about this, then? You merely need to go through the city as you are wont to — then return, and tell me of the things that catch your eye.

## Talk 2

Hao: All is well, all is well...
Traveler: What's well?
Hao: Oh, it's you, Traveler. So, there was a big incident in the city earlier, right?
Hao: Well, it's well that nothing untoward happened afterward... And more importantly, it's well that all the food stalls in the city are still open.
Hao: I mean, what would become of all those delicacies I enjoyed otherwise...
Traveler: Ah, so it's about eating, then...
Hao: Hey, don't you look down on it. The quickest way to know if a place is good or not is to see how its cuisine tastes.
Hao: Ah, just talking about this is making me hungry again. Maybe I should go get a little something...

## Talk 3

Fan Er'ye: The more I hear of this opera, the less I understand it...
Traveler: Is something wrong?
Fan Er'ye: Why, hello there, Traveler. Well, here's the problem: Heyu Tea House has released a few new operas lately.
Fan Er'ye: But they're— Well, they're most lively, that's for sure. But I do not quite comprehend them, or how the young people seem to enjoy it so very much.
Traveler: And how do you feel about that?
Fan Er'ye: That's a good question. Personally, I don't mind hearing some old classics. They're what I'm used to, after all.
Fan Er'ye: But at the same time, Liyue Harbor is undergoing so many changes. A few new operas seem to fit the reigning mood just fine, too.
Fan Er'ye: *sigh* Still, these changes feel all too swift. The old operas haven't played in a while. I wonder what Rex Lapis would— No, let us not speak of that...

## Talk 4

Qingzhou: What have you learned, my liege?
Traveler: A fair bit.
Qingzhou: Oh, verily? Please, do share.
Traveler: There are lots of dogs by the south wharf.
Qingzhou: Oh, good, good. Most lively indeed.
Traveler: The Bubu Pharmacy hosts many finches nearby.
Qingzhou: Finches, yes... A sign of peaceful times. Lovely poetic imagery.
Traveler: Some only care for eating...
Qingzhou: Haha, there is nothing wrong with that. Eating is one of the prime needs and joys of life — especially in a city such as Liyue Harbor.
Qingzhou: Yes, this too is quite fascinating. I will record this. It may yet be of use.
Traveler: Some feel that things are changing too quickly.
Qingzhou: Hmm, that too is as we should expect. To some, Liyue must almost seem to be shedding its skin with every passing day. Even I find it hard to keep up or accept every single shift...
Qingzhou: But this is a matter most broad — I fear that a single poem may not capture it adequately. Still, I shall write it down.
Qingzhou: That should do for now. I see that I chose wisely in seeking your aid, my liege.
Qingzhou: I believe that this will add at least a few new entries to my next anthology.
Qingzhou: Ah, yes, apart from some material goods, I have also prepared a little gift for you. Please take it as thanks for your succour.
Qingzhou: Once my new anthology is published, you may exchange this signature for a free copy.

## Talk 5

Hao: Ah, all this talking is making me hungry. What should I eat...

## Talk 6

Fan Er'ye: *sigh* How quickly this city changes...

## Talk 7

Traveler: I'll do it.
Qingzhou: Splendiferous! I shall be counting on you, my liege.

## Talk 8

Traveler: I'm afraid I have other things to do.
Qingzhou: No harm done, my liege. Poetry requires inspiration, and inspiration may not be coerced. I shall ponder a little by myself.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Qingzhou: Truly, Liyue feels... a little too different.
