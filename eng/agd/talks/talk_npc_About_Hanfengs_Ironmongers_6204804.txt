Traveler: About Hanfeng's Ironmongers...
Master Zhang: My dad left me this place when he retired. He lives in Qingce Village now.
Master Zhang: When he left me the shop, he also left me with a word of advice â€” a solid business is founded on solid relationships.
Master Zhang: Whenever I get laborers and miners coming in here for repairs, I never charge them for it. In return, I only ask that they keep me informed when they find any rare ore.
Master Zhang: It's every ironmonger's dream to fashion a legendary weapon, the sharpest blade of them all... Liyue is the land of the Lord of Geo, so I figure this is where I'll have the best chance of finding the prize ore I'd need...
Master Zhang: If I can get the edge over the competition right from the source, from the raw materials, I can push them out and really strengthen the Hanfeng name... Hehehe, so let me know if you find anything!
