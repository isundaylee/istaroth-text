Ren'yu: Sure, I can help you.
Ren'yu: Oh, thank you so much!
Ren'yu: Here's the prescription, could you help me read it?
Ren'yu: What's this here at the top? They don't look like words.
Ren'yu: It's not writing? I was wondering why the first word on the prescription looked almost like a doodle of a dog.
Ren'yu: I've got it! The head retainer must've known that I couldn't read and purposely drew the prescription in a way that I could understand!
Ren'yu: This looks like a wolf crouching next to a berry bush. Could it mean "wolfberry"?
Ren'yu: The next one is a deer with an arrow pointing towards the top of its head. Could it mean "deer antlers"?
Ren'yu: Thank you very much! You sure are a clever one! Now I'm sure that I won't let the master of the house down!
Ren'yu: Huh, but what's this dark object supposed to be? And this one? I'm done for, I can't even understand simple doodles...
