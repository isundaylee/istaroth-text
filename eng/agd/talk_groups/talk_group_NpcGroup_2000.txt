Wang: O great Millelith heroes, please see to it that The Chasm does not act up these few days!
Wang: And may we be safe and sound as we descend into the mines this time, and may those comrades of ours who no longer come to mine also fare well in their respective paths. Protect us, brave Millelith, protect us...
Wang: Hmm? What is it? Can I help you?
Traveler: You're praying to this thing?
Wang: Well, I'm praying at this Millelith memorial. I mean, it looks like a pile of unassuming rocks, but it's actually been here for five hundred years now!
Wang: The Chasm is under the protection of the Millelith, so every time we have people descend into the mines, we will pray here for the heroic souls of those who have passed to protect us.
Wang: They have long since turned into elements and become one with the mine, so when we pray for their protection, we're also showing our reverence to The Chasm itself, you know?
Wang: The ancients said that "the earth has a spirit, and the elements have souls." Those who sacrificed their lives so that we might live watch over us in similar fashion. So I believe...
Paimon: Five hundred years ago?
Wang: That's right. Back then, a dark calamity swallowed The Chasm, and Rex Lapis commanded the Millelith to stand guard over the ore veins.
Wang: That was a terrible battle. Led by a Yaksha, the Millelith came forth to stem the tide.
Wang: In the end, a group of them led the foe into the depths of The Chasm, and thus quelled the unrest.
Wang: It is said that this memorial was set up for them.
Paimon: Huh. Paimon didn't think that these ugly stones would have such history...
Wang: Hehe, don't disrespect the fallen, little one.
Traveler: Don't you worry, this little one won't bite.
Paimon: Who's a "little one"!?
Wang: Hehe, whatever the case, this is a pretty familiar story to anyone who grew up around The Chasm as we did... There are many versions of the tale, too, which sprung up over time.
Wang: If you were to talk to someone else, they might tell you a different story. Maybe this is the charm of history? Not that I'm particularly cultured, mind, but I'm just saying, y'know?
Wang: Ah, yeah, speaking of which, there's always been a rumor going about. It says that these stones hide another secret that might lead a discerning person to treasure that the Millelith left behind.
Paimon: Treasure that they left behind?
Paimon: Could you give us some details? Let's just say that... Paimon's interest has been piqued!
Wang: Eh, it's just a rumor, but it's one that's got to do with the Millelith member who created this memorial in the first place.
Traveler: Didn't the miners set this memorial up?
Wang: Nah. The one that the miners set up is elsewhere, and it isn't anywhere as large as this one.
Wang: The battle ended, but many of their comrades now rest eternally in the depths of The Chasm, together with that nameless Yaksha...
Wang: One of the soldiers fell from a great height while helping to evacuate the miners and beat back the enemy, injuring his spine and becoming unable to move on his own power as a result...
Wang: But later, it is said that he was not daunted by his circumstances, instead becoming a self-taught and much-famed doctor who would help those in the same situation as himself.
Wang: It is said that this memorial was something he set up to remember his comrades by after he had obtained a Vision.
Wang: His story would gradually fade from history, being replaced with tales of the "Millelith's treasure" and the "Yaksha's inheritance."
Wang: Those are just baseless tales. We miners generally prefer to keep our feet firmly planted, so I don't give much credence to these tales. Still...
Paimon: Still?
Wang: No, it's nothing, I just mean that I won't laugh if you do actually go looking for that treasure.
Wang: I've given it some thought, and it occurred to me that while the tales of treasure might all be false, they exist as a way for generations of people to ensure that stories are passed down and not forgotten by later generations.
Wang: Whatever the case, the one who offers up six items lost within The Chasm before this stone will be awarded the gifts of the Millelith — that's how the story goes.
Wang: And these six items are...
Wang: The Helm of Warding, which may defend one from rockfalls...
Wang: The Cup of Commons, made to memorialize comradeship...
Wang: The Skyfeather, the symbol of lofty ideals...
Wang: The Warrior's Spear, used to fend off the foe...
Wang: The "Flower of Farsight," which grew upon the cliffs of The Chasm...
Wang: And... the "Sundial of Ages," used to remember the bygone past.
Paimon: Well, that wasn't confusing at all, no sir!
Paimon: You sure this wasn't all made up by people later?
Traveler: So these items can all be found within The Chasm?
Wang: I've got no clue. Maybe they were all made up — that would certainly explain why no one's found the legendary treasure this whole time!
Wang: Ah, yes, speaking of which... There was another memorial that I mentioned, yes? *sigh* Everyone's just busied themselves with their own separate things after The Chasm was closed. No one's kept that place clean, I'll bet.
Wang: Could you help me go over there and just tidy the place up? Just a little will do...
Traveler: Sounds dubious to me...
Traveler: So this was the work of a Millelith soldier?
Wang: Indeed, both the Millelith and the miners at The Chasm set memorials up back then.
Traveler: Indeed, disrespecting the fallen is bad manners.
Paimon: Um, sorry...
Traveler: What is this thing?
