Noelle: Did you arrange all of this yourself?
Noelle: To have you do such strenuous work yourself... I should have come to your aid earlier. I have neglected my duty as a maid.
Noelle: You must be tired after a hard day's work. I'll brew you some tea and prepare your favorite snacks. Please rest well.
