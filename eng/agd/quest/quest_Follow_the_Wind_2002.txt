(Quest is part of chapter: Chapter II: Prologue Autumn Winds, Scarlet Leaves)

# Follow the Wind


## Talk 1

Paimon: By the way, what made you suddenly think of checking the prize in the first place?
Kaedehara Kazuha: I heard it the moment it was stolen.
Paimon: Well then why didn't you stop him!?
Kaedehara Kazuha: You'll see. Shortly.

## Talk 2

Beidou: Let me see...
Beidou: It's gone alright... The Vision is missing.
Paimon: Huh! Did somebody steal it? Who would dare do such a thing in broad daylight?
Beidou: We don't know when it was taken exactly.
Beidou: Huh! I never thought that someone here would have the guts to cross Captain Beidou.
Kaedehara Kazuha: No need to worry, even the craftiest sleight of hand does not escape nature's watchful gaze.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm... The culprit has only acted recently. They will not have gotten far.
Kaedehara Kazuha: The Vision was the prize that I had offered, and it was my responsibility to look after it. I will be certain to get it back.
Beidou: Well, if you insist. I'll leave the matter to you then.
Beidou: I'll stay here and try to offer some explanation to all the spectators that came to see the match.
Kaedehara Kazuha: #If you would, please come with me, Traveler.
Traveler: Seems there's nothing else we can do.
Paimon: Umm, but we're on an island, where could he have possibly run to?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Come with me. I can sense the winds are coming.
Traveler: My opponent was a no-show anyway.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Huh? A wind current?
Kaedehara Kazuha: The winds have come at an opportune moment. Let's seize this chance.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Ride the winds upward. From there, we can continue our search for clues.

## Talk 4

Fei the Flyer: You caught up with me... How is that possible!?
Fei the Flyer: I had even prepared a boat to ensure a quick getaway, and still, you caught up to me.
Kaedehara Kazuha: No boat could ever match the speed of the wind.
Fei the Flyer: The wind? What are you talking about? Oh, I get it... your Vision!
Fei the Flyer: Drat, if only I had a Vision... Or if I could activate this one, then you'd never be able to catch me!
Kaedehara Kazuha: This has nothing to do with Visions. You may be skilled at vanishing from a crowd, but it seems you know precious little about how to conceal yourself from nature's gaze.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Additionally, your chosen escape route was flawed for reasons that are too numerous to go into, and on top of that, I could hear your boasting and proud laughter in the wind as I was pursuing you.
Kaedehara Kazuha: In other words, you failed to meet any of the basic criteria for a grand heist: namely speed, stealth, and style.
Fei the Flyer: You... You!
Kaedehara Kazuha: But most disappointing of all is the state of the Vision in your hand.
Kaedehara Kazuha: It appears that the Vision doesn't respond to human desire indiscriminately.
Fei the Flyer: Fine, fine! I admit it!
Fei the Flyer: I've had my eyes on this Vision for quite some time now. I decided to register after hearing that this fighting contest was full of a bunch of lousy fighters. I fought my way to the finals and...
Paimon: Aha, so you were supposed to be our opponent!
Fei the Flyer: I'd intended to win the contest through skill alone all along, but then you showed up!
Fei the Flyer: After watching the semi-finals, I knew that I didn't stand a chance. But I wasn't about to give up on the Vision so easily after coming all this way.
Fei the Flyer: Since there was no use in trying to face you in the match, I decided to put my skills to good use while everyone's attention was on you and Beidou.
Fei the Flyer: I was convinced I'd prepared thoroughly for my escape... but somehow, you still managed to catch up to me.
Traveler: You've got nowhere else to run now, just give it up.
Fei the Flyer: Ugh... Drat... This could — this should have gone differently...
Traveler: There'll be consequences if you resist any further.
Fei the Flyer: Hah! I know an empty threat when I hear one!
Fei the Flyer: Fine... but you'd better mean it! It didn't activate once I took it anyway, it's nothing but a useless shell to me.
Kaedehara Kazuha: You know, according to the laws of the sea, the penalty for stealing is breaking the culprit's arms...
Fei the Flyer: Huh! You're not serious, are you!?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Not to mention that the item you stole was a prize, you didn't show up for the final match, and you damaged the reputation of the captain of The Crux Fleet.
Kaedehara Kazuha: It seems that it would be only fair to brand the word "thief" on your forehead with a hot iron.
Paimon: Whoa, whoa, we don't need to go that far, do we?
Fei the Flyer: Ugh, I never would have guessed you could be so cruel.
Fei the Flyer: If this is where talking gets me, then forget it. I'll risk a fight!
Traveler: Hand over the Vision.
Fei the Flyer: After all I went through to get it? I think not!
Traveler: Just do as we say and there'll be no further consequences.
Fei the Flyer: R—Really?
Traveler: If you give up the Vision, we'll let you go.

## Talk 5

Fei the Flyer: A—Argh!
Fei the Flyer: No, no! Do what you want, but please, don't brand my forehead, please!!!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm... He has persevered to the bitter end, and now death looms near... yet still, the gods do not bestow their favor upon him.
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...Put down the Vision and leave. I've changed my mind... No further punishment for you.
Fei the Flyer: Huh?
Kaedehara Kazuha: What's wrong? Are you asking for more punishment?
Kaedehara Kazuha: It's up to you. Such willingness is commendable and fits the way of the samurai.
Fei the Flyer: N—No, no need for that. Thank you for releasing me. You truly are generous!
Paimon: Huh, Paimon doesn't get it. Were you just trying to scare him?
Kaedehara Kazuha: I take no pleasure in frightening others. I was just testing all possibilities while the Vision remained in his hands.
Kaedehara Kazuha: When people are forced into a corner, that is when their greatest strength will appear. I thought it may be an opportunity for him to awaken the Vision.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But unfortunately, nothing happened.
Traveler: So you were planning this all along?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, I wanted to know whether it were possible for an extinguished Vision to be reawakened.
Kaedehara Kazuha: From the moment he stole the Vision, I decided to use him for this experiment.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I have tried many other methods in the past.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Though few tales tell of a "masterless Vision reawakening"...
Kaedehara Kazuha: After seeing you command multiple elements, I figured that nothing is impossible.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Come, why don't you give it a try? Let's see if you can give me the answer I'm hoping for.
Traveler: I'll try.
Paimon: Hmm, the Vision didn't seem to respond at all.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I see... So you are also unable to rekindle the Vision.
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...No matter, this was expected. I suppose this Vision is still mine to take for now.
Traveler: Why are you so attached to this Vision?
Paimon: Yeah, what's the story behind this Vision, anyway?
Kaedehara Kazuha: The story begins with an old friend...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Perhaps one day I may come to find that all I have done is meaningless.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But as a wandering samurai, I find meaning in traveling and the sprawling beauty of nature that lies along the way, while still retaining the "warrior way" in my heart.
Paimon: Kazuha...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hehe, it's just another way of saying I do as I please.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Alright then. It's time we returned.
Traveler: Let's go.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Allow me to gather the wind for us once more.
Traveler: If you need to talk more, I'm here to listen.
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...Do not let my feelings trouble you.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But thank you.
Traveler: Why are you so determined to rekindle the Vision?
Traveler: ...

## Talk 6

Paimon: Huh? Did Beidou leave already? Maybe she went back to her ship?
Zhuhan: If you're looking for the Captain, she was summoned by Lady Ningguang.
Zhuhan: It seems that The Crux Clash got out of hand this time and has attracted her attention.
Zhuhan: Captain Beidou was muttering something about Ningguang being a stick-in-the-mud as she headed off to Liyue Harbor.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Haha, it's not unusual for those two to be at odds with one another.
Zhuhan: But still, Captain Beidou was disappointed she didn't get to witness the crowning of the new champion. She had been looking forward to it for quite some time.
Kaedehara Kazuha: The one who stole the Vision was originally to be this hero's opponent in the final round.
Kaedehara Kazuha: He knew he stood no chance of winning the match, thus the wicked idea of stealing the prize took hold in his mind.
Kaedehara Kazuha: In which case, The Crux Clash comes to a clear-cut conclusion.
Zhuhan: Huh? So that's what happened!?
Zhuhan: If that's the case, then the rules stipulate that he is disqualified... and our hero here is the champion!
Paimon: Paimon thought we'd win and all, but not like this...
Zhuhan: It doesn't matter, as the saying goes, "honor given is honor deserved." Now, let me go prepare the champion's medal to award you.
Traveler: So will we be able to travel to Inazuma now?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, I believe so. Though Captain Beidou is no longer present here, I'll be sure she receives word of it. She is a woman of her word.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But the voyage to Inazuma is a treacherous one. You will be plagued by a perpetual tempest the entire trip.
Kaedehara Kazuha: In fact, the relentless rain and wind are also an embodiment of the Raiden Shogun's will to close the nation.
Paimon: Hold on a second, you're saying she can change the weather just with the power of her mind!?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Let us not forget that this is one of the Seven Archons. If Liyue's Morax could form Guyun Stone Forest by casting down his stone spears, then it should come as no great surprise that the Raiden Shogun is capable of summoning an eternal tempest.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Suffice it to say that if you wish to journey to Inazuma, the Alcor will need some time. You will be notified once all the preparations have been made.
Kaedehara Kazuha: In the meantime, I intend to embark on a journey of my own. I will travel all across the vast lands of Liyue, in the hope of finding a way to reawaken the Vision.
Paimon: Paimon believes you'll find a way for sure!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Thank you. May both our journeys prove meaningful.
Kaedehara Kazuha: One final word of warning. The part of your journey that lies after the storm may well prove to be the most arduous.

## Additional Conversations
