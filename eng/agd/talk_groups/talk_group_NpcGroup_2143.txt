Traveler: Hello there.
Baiwen: Yes, nice to meet you as well. We were expecting you, in fact. Your movements correspond to the intelligence we have on hand.
Baiwen: If you are looking for Lady Ningguang... Well, this is the Jade Chamber, the foremost intelligence hub and the epicenter of all important decisions in Liyue, after all. You've come to the right place.
Baiwen: Although, based on the intel on file, we estimated that you would arrive a whole two hours earlier than you actually did...
Baiwen: I must reflect on the cause of this discrepancy. Was our source at fault, or did we make an error in our calculations?

Traveler: I'm just passing through, actually.
Baiwen: Is that so? How fascinating...
Baiwen: I find it hard to believe that you came here for leisure alone. After all, this is the very same Jade Chamber that you helped to rebuild.
Baiwen: All intel heretofore gathered indicates that no one comes to the Jade Chamber without good reason. This rule has yet to see exception.
Baiwen: As Lady Ningguang's secretary and one in charge of collecting and organizing intelligence, I must strive to get a handle on the information of all guests, even ones as esteemed as yourself.

Traveler: I really respect Lady Ningguang.
Baiwen: Many people do, including myself.
Baiwen: The Tianquan's words can move mountains, and everyone knows it. My task is to help oversee Lady Ningguang's intelligence network.
Baiwen: Lady Ningguang's razor-sharp mind tears through vast amounts of information at pace, and quickly reaches a verdict. These pearls of wisdom are then discarded from the Jade Chamber, giving guidance on "prosperity" to the world below...
Baiwen: Do you, too, wish to learn of such things?
