Traveler: What about ores in Sumeru?

## Talk

Ahangar: There's no new information about it now, sorry. You can come back another time.

## Talk

Ahangar: What do you need?

## Talk

Traveler: I'd like something made...
Ahangar: Sure.

## Talk

Traveler: I'd like to buy a weapon.
Ahangar: Pattern-welded steel weapons need to be ordered in advance. These are all that I have readily available.

## Talk

Traveler: And you are...
Ahangar: I'm a blacksmith who's been crafting weapons for the Eremites. Sometimes I make tools, accessories, and furniture pieces for other people, too.
Ahangar: Sumeru worships Dendro, and most of the researchers aren't in the habit of arming themselves and believe in Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. So, most seem to find the idea of metallic weapons off-putting.
Ahangar: I can make wooden weapons, too. But the majority of the orders I get in are for the pattern-welded steel weapons required by the mercenaries.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Ahangar: Bye.

## Talk

Traveler: *I'd like something made.*
Ahangar: Your order from last time is ready. Are you here to collect it, or to place a new order?

## Talk

Traveler: You are...
Ahangar: I'm a blacksmith who's been crafting weapons for the Eremites. Sometimes I make tools, accessories, and furniture pieces for other people, too.
Ahangar: Sumeru worships Dendro, and most of the researchers aren't in the habit of arming themselves, their belief in the Dendro Archon besides. In fact, most seem to find the idea of metallic weapons off-putting.
Ahangar: I can make wooden weapons, too. But the majority of the orders I get in are for the pattern-wielded steel weapons required by the mercenaries.

Traveler: Adventure Challenge

## Talk

Ahangar: Victory is yours. I've got to say, you're pretty good.

## Talk

Ahangar: You're good, but I'm better.

## Talk

Traveler: I'm alright.
Ahangar: Seems like you are pretty confident in your abilities.
Ahangar: But as they say, people with umbrellas are most easily damped on rainy days. You'd better be careful.
Ahangar: Regular maintenance of handy weapons will help you better deal with crisis.
