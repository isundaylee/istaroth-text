# Citlali's Handkerchief and Key

The key given to you by Citlali so that "you won't wake me up by beating on my door while I'm drunk." You carefully place it alongside the handkerchief she gave you. After all, you've collected so many keys in the past, so this one needs to have a special mark to stand out.
