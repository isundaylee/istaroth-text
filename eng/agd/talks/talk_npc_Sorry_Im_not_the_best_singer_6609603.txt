Traveler: Sorry, I'm not the best singer...
Batz: That's okay! You don't have to be an expert to listen to music.
Batz: I'm not a professional musician, either â€” my regular job is working as a caretaker for the Tepetlisaurs. That hasn't stopped me and my Saurian friends from appreciating music, though.
Batz: If I have to make an analogy, it'd be like how some people love to listen to music as they do their chores. Aren't there a lot of people like that?
