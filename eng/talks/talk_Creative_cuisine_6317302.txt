Traveler: Creative cuisine?
Tomoki: Heh heh, that's right! You see, this street is filled with old, famous shops that serve people the same old stuff all the time!
Tomoki: So I thought that something creative and new might attract a real crowd!
Tomoki: Aside from ordinary takoyaki and sushi, I've also added creative cuisines into the menu.
Tomoki: These are my pride and joy: Milky Natto Ramen, Colorful Spicy Dango... What do you think? Sounds delicious, no?
