Traveler: Is war going to break out?
Xuanzhu: Not at all. It is our duty to prepare for rainy days and take precautions.
Xuanzhu: We enjoy a good relationship with Fontaine, and we do not expect our relations to turn sour in the coming centuries...
Xuanzhu: But according to historical data, our primary enemy has never been foreign nations, but something even more powerful.
Xuanzhu: Our predecessors succeeded in stopping the huge threat from centuries ago, but no one can be certain that we will not face even greater foes one day.
Xuanzhu: It would be too late to start preparing when danger is already at the door.
Xuanzhu: That is why we must build our defenses based on the worst-case scenario and the most mighty enemy possible.
