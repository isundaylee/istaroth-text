Traveler: About your patrols...
Godwin: So far, I've taken care of quite a few hilichurls and slimes, but there's always more of them...
Godwin: They've been appearing more frequently of late. I cannot allow them to get any closer to Mondstadt. My lover Glory is...
Godwin: ...No, it's nothing. Thanks for listening to me. Stay safe on your travels. Here's some of the experience I've gained out in the wild — I hope it'll be useful to you.

Traveler: I don't think I've seen you in the city before.
Godwin: Oh, you wouldn't have. I belong to an elite squadron of the Knights of Favonius, hand-picked by and reporting directly to Grand Master Varka himself. Our job is to be out there on the front line, defending Mondstadt.
Godwin: We are always called out on top-priority missions, so we hardly have time to hang about in the city.
Godwin: Speaking of which... Have you ever met a girl called Glory?
Traveler: Who is Varka?
Godwin: He is the current Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius. Of all the people in Mondstadt, he is the most deserving of our trust and admiration.
Godwin: And that's not an overstatement. I am sure my fellow knights share my opinion.
Godwin: For senior knights like us, there is nothing more glorious than to accompany the Grand Master himself on an expedition.
Godwin: And I get to be part of just such a glorious expedition!
Traveler: Where's the rest of the expedition party?
Godwin: That's what I wanna know, too!
Godwin: I... You see... The thing is...
Godwin: *sigh* Forget it, I'm past the point of trying to save face...
Godwin: As Grand Master Varka's expedition party was getting ready to leave Mondstadt, I—I lost a keepsake from Glory and then fell behind when they set off...
Godwin: So now, as you can see, I've lost both the keepsake and the expedition party. I can't bring myself to go crawling back to Glory like this...
Godwin: If you want to laugh at me, go ahead. A little laughter might make things more bearable.
Traveler: Who's Glory?
Godwin: Glory is the girl I love. She likes sitting on a bench, listening to the sound of the wind, and feeling the warmth of another body next to her's... That's what she said, anyway.
Godwin: If you see her around the city, please...
Godwin: Ugh, never mind, there's no need to bother you.
