# Rose Custard

A dessert made from fermented milk. Once the milk is fermented and filtered into yogurt, stir sugar in before garnishing with dried roses and chopped nuts. In the beginning, this dish was only popular among adventurers and traveling merchants, but now, it is served as breakfast and a tea-time dessert across Sumeru.
