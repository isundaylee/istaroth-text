Maile: Hey there, friend! You free for a chat?

Traveler: Sure, hit me with it.
Maile: Haha, that was quick! I like your style.
Maile: That said, I don't actually have much to talk about... *sigh* You know, the Masters of the Night-Wind come and go like the mist. I knew this would happen, even before coming over to see her.
Maile: I learned a new instrument recently, and wanted to play it for her. If I spent all the time I've been waiting for her practicing, I'd definitely be on the road to becoming a master!
Maile: But playing the same tunes over and over is pretty boring. Maybe I should become a graffiti apprentice somewhere close by...
Maile: Ah, my apologies. I've let myself get a bit carried away... You should get back to your business.

Maile: You know, I was worried at first that she might've been injured during the Abyss incursion, so I asked around. Turns out that she just took a few bumps!

Traveler: Sorry, I've other things to attend to.
Maile: Ah, go ahead then. Don't let me take up your time.

Traveler: It's fine.
Maile: Haha, you're the patient sort, huh? Good. That kinda temperament will make you lots of friends.
Maile: And that's great! Life's all about spending time with friends to share our joys and delicious food!
