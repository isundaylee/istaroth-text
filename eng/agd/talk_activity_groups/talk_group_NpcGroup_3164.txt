Nameless: Why? Why can't I find it?
Traveler: What are you looking for?
Nameless: I'm looking for... for... I've forgotten. Each time I think I'm about to remember it, it disappears from my mind.
Nameless: Hey, do you know what I'm supposed to be looking for?
Traveler: How would I know?
Nameless: Ugh, I just can't think...
Nameless: Curses, curses! Why can't I remember?
Traveler: It'll pop into your mind eventually.
Nameless: That won't do. I can't wait that long.
Nameless: Whatever it is that I'm looking for, it's definitely of the utmost importance to me. I need it back as soon as possible.
Nameless: I have an inexplicable feeling that the reason I am here in this place is to find that very thing. Failing to find it is not an option.
Nameless: I will strike down anyone that tries to interrupt me or stand in my way...
Nameless: Strike down... Wait, that's right! Brandishing a sword and executing people... it feels familiar, pleasing, hahaha, the surge of blood, like a river of red.
Nameless: When was my sword last stained red?
Nameless: Hmm, it must have been a few days by now. Well, at least you're here today.
Nameless: For now, let's leave aside the question of what I was looking for. I've tired myself out thinking about it for so long, and now I need to relax.
Nameless: Ah, it's been a while since I brandished my blade. I can hear Takatsuki Dougire complaining.
Nameless: Aw, listen, she's calling out because she wants to cut you into pieces, hahaha. Having a duel with you would make her very happy indeed.
Traveler: Are you... okay?
Nameless: You can't hear Takatsuki Dougire's voice? What a pity.
Nameless: Those who live by the sword know to listen to the voice of their blade. ...Hehe, she's nagging me to get on with it again.
Nameless: Come, draw your weapon and try your chances against me.
Traveler: Your sword can't speak.
Traveler: Think back to when you arrived here.
Nameless: When I got here? All I remember doing here is wielding my sword. As for why I was wielding it...
Nameless: Haha, yes, now that I do remember. I was executing someone!
Nameless: If you strike your enemy with your sword, blood surges like a river of red. It gives you a real rush, hahaha.
Traveler: Have you looked in all your pockets?
Nameless: I already have, it isn't on my person.
Nameless: Even though I don't remember what I was after, I can tell when something's not what I'm looking for. Whatever it is, it's not on me.
Nameless: Come on, what is it, what am I looking for...
