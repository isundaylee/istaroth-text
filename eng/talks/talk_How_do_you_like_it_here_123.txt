Traveler: How do you like it here?
Charlotte: It's idyllic. And the lighting is perfect â€” you can take the most beautiful photos from literally any angle.
Charlotte: And yet... We're currently inside your teapot... right?
Traveler: That's right. Does that worry you?
Charlotte: No, not really. I was just wondering... What happens if someone opens the lid and pours water in?
Charlotte: How would that manifest in here? A flood? A storm? Would the water level start rising from beneath our feet?
Charlotte: I'd love to record that as it happens... Would you mind heading outside for a second and pouring some water in?
Traveler: I don't use this pot to brew tea. So don't worry.
Charlotte: Really? You've never brewed tea in here? Ah, well that's a shame. I was going to ask you about how this unique environment affects the flavor of the tea.
Charlotte: I heard this legend during an interview with someone from Liyue once. They said there was once an adeptus who poured half of the Bishui River into their teapot to brew some tea...
Charlotte: When the tea was ready, the adeptus poured the whole pot back into the river, and that's how the river got its distinct color.
Charlotte: No idea if there's any truth to it... I'd sure like to taste the water from the Bishui River if I ever got the chance, just to see if there's any hint of a tea flavor.
