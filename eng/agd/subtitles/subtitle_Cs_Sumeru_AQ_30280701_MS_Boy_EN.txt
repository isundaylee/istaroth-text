Who would have thought...
The world would be so eager for my "birth"
I remember you
Buer, the God of Wisdom
And standing beside you... the Traveler
Is he all-knowing and powerful now like Greater Lord Rukkhadevata?
No, I can't feel the same kind of divinity I felt from the Greater Lord
It seems that the sages didn't get the chance to infuse the Divine Knowledge Capsules into him
But even still...
He has undoubtedly become a true "god" now
So we're too late?
The Balladeer has already... already become a god...?
"The Balladeer"
A long bygone title
When my spirit ascended to divinity
I felt as if I had existed for the same number of epochs as heaven and earth
Looking back
The existence of what once called itself "Kunikuzushi" appears infinitely small
And ugly
