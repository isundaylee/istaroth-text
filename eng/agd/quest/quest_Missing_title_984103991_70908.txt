Traveler: Surely it isn't as simple as that...
Victoria: Hmph. Sharp people always make enemies of others.
Victoria: Some people were born in the sun, and thus take light and warmth for granted.
Victoria: But love, piety, holiness... all these wonderful things were built on the blood and tears of sinners.

Victoria: Take what I've said as a warning. Take this with you, too. I hope it will keep you vigilant.
