Traveler: Secret treasure of the Liliacruces Ordo...?
Contarini: *sigh* That's just a ridiculous legend.
Contarini: They claim that there was a secret organization several hundred years back known as the Liliacruces Ordo, and that they left behind a treasure in Petrichor that could make any wish come true.
Contarini: Sounds like exactly the sort of tale you'd tell to sucker tourists in, don't you think? But some still believe it... Like that Sumeru researcher over there.
