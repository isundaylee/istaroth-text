# The Little Pirate Goes Out to Sea


## Talk 1

Little Meng: You're just in time, Traveler! I was just looking for you!
Paimon: Eh? What's up, Little Meng?
Little Meng: Do you remember when I asked you to help me send a drifting bottle downriver with my worries in it?
Little Meng: I honestly wasn't holding out much hope...
Little Meng: But then, one of my father's business partners came looking for him a few days ago.
Little Meng: He said that they're currently looking to get into the mushroom business, and are planning to go to Sumeru to survey the market.
Little Meng: So they wanted to ask my dad if he wanted to go with them.
Little Meng: They even said that they could take me along!
Little Meng: Dad didn't agree at first, but one of his friends pulled out a letter and asked to speak privately with him.
Little Meng: They talked for a while, and after that, Dad said that I could go with him to Sumeru...
Little Meng: Well, I don't know why he changed his mind so suddenly, but...
Little Meng: I can go to Sumeru now! We're going to Sumeru! Woohoo!
Traveler: Congratulations!
Little Meng: It must be that drifting bottle we sent, I just know it! Thank you so much, Traveler!
Little Meng: Dad said that after going to Sumeru, they'll also go to a place called Qiaoying Village.
Traveler: Qiaoying Village?
Little Meng: Yup. Dad says it's a tea village where they plant lots of tea trees that produce super high-quality tea leaves. The name's a bit of a toughie, though...
Little Meng: Well, but let's put that aside for now. We'll need to get to Sumeru first.
Little Meng: It's really far from here, so it's going to take a while for us to get there.
Little Meng: But I've heard people say that traveling requires a lot of preparations, since you could encounter all kinds of situations on the way.
Little Meng: You're a frequent traveler, so... could you teach me a few tricks for life on the road?
Little Meng: Like, uh...
Little Meng: Like, what do you usually eat when you're out traveling?
Little Meng: Dad says that they would always eat stuff they made themselves. But I only know a few simple dishes, and I don't know if I can do them well or not...
Paimon: #Ohohoho! Cooking! Now that's something we're experts at, huh, Traveler?
Traveler: That's right. I can teach you.
Paimon: Well, then Paimon thinks we should go look for a stove-top somewhere...
Paimon: ...Hmm, why don't we borrow Chef Mao's kitchen?
Little Meng: Chef Mao? Uhh... Isn't he pretty scary most of the time?
Paimon: Chef Mao? Scary? He's a great guy!
Little Meng: R—Really? But every time Dad and I eat there, he'd scrunch up his eyebrows whenever I'd pick the Qingxin out of my dish and not eat it...
Traveler: That's right. Leave it to me!
Traveler: Y'know, I might be going to Sumeru myself.
Little Meng: Really? Then let's meet there!

## Talk 2

Chef Mao: Oh, if it isn't the Traveler and Little Meng! Do you need anything?
Little Meng: Eh? I, uh, um... Traveler...
Traveler: We'd like to borrow your kitchen, please.
Chef Mao: Sure, but that's a little sudden of you...
Chef Mao: Oh. Is that how it is... Alright, use it as you please.
Chef Mao: Little Meng, remember not to be picky with your food while you're out traveling.
Little Meng: I—I got it...
Little Meng: Traveler, please teach me how to make something really tasty.
Little Meng: I'd like to give Dad a surprise while we're on the road.
Paimon: You got it!
Paimon: #Now then, Traveler, what shall we make?

## Talk 3

Traveler: Chicken-Mushroom Skewer.
Paimon: Ooh, that's an adventurer classic!

## Talk 4

Traveler: Satisfying Salad.
Paimon: Mm-hmm. Simple and good.

## Talk 5

Traveler: Sweet Madame.
Paimon: Hehe, delicious! But Paimon wonders if it might be too difficult...

## Talk 6

Little Meng: Wow, this recipe is so detailed... So many words...
Paimon: Hmm. You know what? Paimon gets the feeling that it won't quite be a pleasant surprise if it's this simple.
Little Meng: Eh? Then what should we do?
Paimon: Why don't we... add some unique ingredients into the mix?
Paimon: What should we add, though?

## Talk 7

Traveler: Jueyun Chilis.
Paimon: Gonna put the spice into culinary life, eh? Sounds great!
Paimon: Long-distance travel tires people out, so a little spice can help keep people alert.
Paimon: Alright then! Let's go find ourselves some Jueyun Chilis!

## Talk 8

Traveler: Sweet Flowers.
Paimon: Gonna make this dish just a little sweeter, huh?
Paimon: Sweet foods really do lift one's spirits.
Paimon: Let's go find ourselves a few Sweet Flowers.

## Talk 9

Traveler: Slime Condensate!
Paimon: Aw yeah! Paimon's favorite!
Little Meng: Uh, can Slime Condensate really be used to make meals?
Paimon: Oooof course they can! We even know a master chef who uses Slime Condensate in her cooking!
Paimon: Woohoo! Time to go look for some Slime Condensate!
Paimon: Hehehe... Paimon's looking forward to this one!
