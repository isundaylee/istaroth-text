Letter With Elegant Handwriting: I tried a different approach today, which unexpectedly yielded some relevant information.
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: During the war, the International Trade Association had an organization registered with it that specialized in pet treatment and trade known as the "Puppy Union."
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: Its symbol just happens to be a dog wearing a bamboo hat. Not that this proves anything alone, but I found two other suspicious things:

Letter With Elegant Handwriting: 2. The Puppy Union's event funding went through at least six layers of transfers, quite suspicious...
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: I will continue investigating.
