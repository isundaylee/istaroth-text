# Missing title (1531423959)

Yoimiya: I think I'll stay here for a bit longer. The show is still not quite over in my heart.
Yoimiya: Oh, but if you wanted to chat, I'll happily oblige.
Traveler: What do you want to do afterward?
Yoimiya: Matsuzaka and the others are still waiting for me so we can go hunt down the Great Mujina Youkai. I'm like a big sister to them, so I can't go back on my word.
Yoimiya: Also, I want to go and ask everyone what they thought of the fireworks.
Yoimiya: And over the next few days, I'd also like to thank everyone for their support.
Yoimiya: That includes you and Paimon, too, of course.
Traveler: Are fireworks expensive?
Yoimiya: For you guys...
Yoimiya: I'll do it for free!
Yoimiya: I did kind of force it on you, after all. Not to mention that I dragged you along with me and gave you all sorts of trouble along the way. Hehe, I'd feel bad if I charged you any Mora.
Traveler: Are you sure? I feel bad...
Yoimiya: #It's fine. ...Look, how about we make a deal: After you find your {F#brother}{M#sister}, tell {F#him}{M#her} to come to Naganohara Fireworks for all {F#his}{M#her} fireworks needs. That way, I'll get another customer. Sound fair?
Yoimiya: #Also, it'd be nice to meet {F#him}{M#her}.
Traveler: What if the Tenryou Commission causes you more trouble...
Yoimiya: I'll kick their butts again!
Yoimiya: Hahaha, I'm joking. Didn't I tell you that my family deals with the Commissions quite a bit?
Yoimiya: We have an easy enough time of it. At the worst, we'd have to apologize, smile, and pay a fine. It wouldn't be the end of the world.
Yoimiya: You two should be careful, though. Without the same connections, you can't afford to be as reckless as me, hee-hee.
