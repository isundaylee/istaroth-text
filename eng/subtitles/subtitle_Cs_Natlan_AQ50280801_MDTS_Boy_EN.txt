Listen
Did they...
Lose?
No... It can't be...
Aâ€”Ah... Ah...
We...
Are the inheritors of memory and legend!
Those
Who grew alongside sun and wind!
Those
Who forged our own destiny and future!
That is Natlan's fire
The lifeblood of our nation!
Their voices
I hear them
In the beginning
There was darkness
Until someone set themselves aflame
Only then
Did the universe know light
We won't give up "hope"
We will march forward together
This is where we forge our future...
With our own two hands!
