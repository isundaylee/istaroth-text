Lila: *sob* ...The doctor is a meanie, grandma! The shot she gave me hurt!
Tahmina: Haha. No, sweetheart, this lady here isn't being a meanie. She's here as a representative of the Dendro Archon.
Tahmina: You're like an unwell little tree, Lila. What the doctor is doing is nourishing you.
Lila: I know the Dendro Archon is a good person... Does that mean that the doctor is a good person too?
Tahmina: Yes. Listen to her, and you'll grow tall and strong.
Tahmina: Otherwise, the Eremites will take you away for defying the Dendro Archon!
Lila: No, no! They're scary! I don't want that...
