Ajilenakh Dash: My prize money... Why didn't I get any prize money!? I was so excited about it... I came here for nothing!
Traveler: Prize money?
Ajilenakh Dash: Yeah! I participated in the competition but didn't get a single Mora! That doesn't make any sense!
Paimon: Erm... Paimon thinks the rules regarding the prize money are written on the billboard... Although the rules are a little complex and a hassle to read through, Paimon highly doubts there would be prize money for competitors that didn't make it past the preliminaries...
Traveler: How about I share some of my prize money with you?
Paimon: Huh? Are you serious about that? We didn't get too much ourselves either, right?
Paimon: Fine, Paimon guesses it's reasonable, seeing that we knocked her out before she knew what was going on...
Ajilenakh Dash: I... Umm... No, that's okay!
Ajilenakh Dash: It wouldn't be right to accept prize money given to me out of pity! My underlings will laugh at me if they found out!
Paimon: Hmm, are you turning down Mora because of your pride as their boss?
Paimon: That's very reputable. Paimon is impressed!
Traveler: Reality check!
Paimon: Right, you should pay more attention in the future and at least read the rules before you do anything! Otherwise, you'll only get the short end of the stick!
Ajilenakh Dash: I've already accepted it. I don't plan on making a scene! I just feel a little discouraged.
Ajilenakh Dash: Ahh, don't mind me, just leave me alone to sulk a little longer... I'll return to my normal self in no time!
Traveler: Let's leave her alone...
Paimon: Yeah, she has always been loud and lively. She'll be fine.
