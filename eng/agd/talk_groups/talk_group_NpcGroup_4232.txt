Sabbah: The Sumeru Roses we planted and the Golden Roses in Affan's nursery have both been growing nicely. Thank you so very much.

Traveler: Which Darshan were you in, by the way?
Sabbah: Oh, I could talk for three whole days about that!
Sabbah: I was with Amurta and specialized in plant evolution, so you could say my work was evidence-based.
Sabbah: That means that it is impossible to reach new conclusions without new material. Simply put, historical samples are necessary to examine historical plants.
Sabbah: But there are only so many fossil samples available, and the Akademiya is limited in its ability to provide new ones.
Sabbah: Those were the circumstances, yet the institute still demanded results.
Sabbah: So some people would just take a previous study, revise or add something to it, and turn it in. You also find that quite pointless, right?

Traveler: How's life in Aaru Village?
Sabbah: Oh, I've been doing alright. Thanks for your concern.
Sabbah: The neighbors have been very kind to me, and Affan swings around to chat often, so... I'm definitely a lot less lonely than I was before.
Sabbah: Though I fear that I can't just get books or research equipment whenever I want, I believe that as long as I desire to seek knowledge, I shall find it, no matter where I am.

Traveler: ...
Sabbah: In truth, we could make new discoveries for sure if we looked towards history and geography for new materials.
Sabbah: Certain literary documents that Amurta would usually ignore could be used as well, though that would surely cross into Vahumana and Haravatat territory.
Sabbah: I was not proficient in those fields, and requesting the related files was troublesome, never mind working with their researchers...
Sabbah: But I believe that if we could actually work together as a team, many questions of the past would finally be answered.
Sabbah: It's a shame that we couldn't continue our collaboration attempts. I must say that people in Vahumana and Haravatat have very peculiar perspectives, though...
Sabbah: I had to be very careful with my wording and phrasing in my submissions to them to avoid misunderstandings and misinterpretations.
Sabbah: Before I was kicked out of the Akademiya, I was still in the middle of an argument with someone from Haravatat. Now I can't even do that...

## Talk 5

Ziyad: ♪Rose, oh rose, grant me my wish.
Ziyad: ♪Blooming from a stone, the Golden Rose sang to me.
Ziyad: ♪She sang...
Paimon: That's a local Sumeru folk song called the "Singing Rose," right? It's such a cute song.
Paimon: Too bad the boy ran off halfway through. Paimon would have loved to hear the whole thing and say hi to him.
Sabbah: You must be new here. First time in Aaru Village?
Traveler: Yes.
Sabbah: No wonder you've never heard of that folk song.
Sabbah: Well then, are you scholars looking to study abroad in Sumeru? I know that there are many foreign scholars in the Akademiya.
Paimon: We do know a lot of scholars, but we aren't quite like them ourselves.
Paimon: #Technically, we're adventurers, the glorious world-trotting duo — Paimon and Traveler!
Sabbah: World-trotting? Hahaha!
Paimon: What's so funny? We're super famous adventurers, believe it or not.
Sabbah: No, I wasn't mocking you, friends from faraway. Just the opposite. It's a delight to hear uplifting stories like people traveling the world.
Sabbah: When you're as detached from the world as I am, such enthusiastic remarks can really catch you off guard.
Sabbah: I'm sorry if I offended you. My name is Sabbah. I offer you my apologies as well as my welcome to the village.
Sabbah: Ah yes. Were you talking about the rose folk song that Ziyad was singing?
Traveler: Correct.
Sabbah: We can talk more about it if you're interested. I hope it will liven up your journey.
Paimon: Are you going to sing for us, Sabbah? Paimon's dying to hear the rest of it!
Sabbah: Sorry, I'm not good at singing... But we can discuss what the song is about.
Paimon: Sure! So, that kid sang about the rose granting wishes...
Sabbah: Yes. In a tiny village like ours, we don't have a big athenaeum like they do at the Akademiya. All our songs are passed down orally.
Sabbah: It's my belief that the wish-granting flower in the song represents the collective imagination of our ancestors.
Sabbah: In a harsh environment like the desert, water is an extremely vital resource, so they prized water-storing plants.
Sabbah: So, the more adverse the terrain, the more stories there are about plants. It's a reflection of our ancestors' yearning for a better life.
Sabbah: At the same time, plants are also a part of the symbiotic relationship between our ancestors and the flora and fauna of the desert.
Sabbah: However... Aaru is built on sand and the soil here is actually not suitable for the cultivation of Sumeru Roses.
Sabbah: The Sumeru Roses I planted could never grow, so if you ask me, the Golden Rose in the song must have been a product of people's imagination...
Paimon: Uh, hold on, Paimon can't keep up anymore...
Paimon: Is this what you usually talk with people about, Miss Sabbah?
Sabbah: Ah! I'm sorry, I thought since you were new here, you'd prefer such topics over farming or the weather.
Paimon: Paimon got lost somewhere between "symbiotic relationship" and "the collective imagination," but don't worry, Paimon understood that last sentence!
Paimon: You said that the land here isn't suitable for Sumeru Roses, right? We've also only seen them in places with moist soil.
Traveler: Well, this place is mostly sand, after all.
Sabbah: Speaking of roses, I was thinking that since you two are adventurers, perhaps I can hire you to...
Paimon: Now we're talking! We're battle-hardened adventurers. We can do any job, no problem!
Traveler: So, what can we help you with?
Sabbah: I know it's ridiculous to want roses that don't belong here to bloom, but regardless, I still really want to see them.
Sabbah: I'm embarrassed to even say it, but that is my wish.
Sabbah: Based on what I know about roses, they will grow if fertilized with highly concentrated Dendro, even if you grow them in sand.
Sabbah: But it's near-impossible to get such fertilizer out here, so I'm wondering if you may be able to get your hands on some...
Traveler: Dendro?
Sabbah: Yes, Dendro promotes plant growth and works especially well on poor crops.
Sabbah: But I'm just a normal person without a Dendro Vision, and I lack the resources to obtain effective fertilizer.
Paimon: Hmm. If it's just *Dendro* you want, this is pretty easy! We got this!
Traveler: Roses sure are picky customers.
Traveler: Rose folk song?
Traveler: No.
Sabbah: Huh? Did I guess wrong? Let me think again...
