Shiliu: What won't sell?
Shiliu: Jewelry. Even though I brought all of this personally from Mingxing Jewelry in Liyue Harbor. They're the best of the best, I mean, just look at these!
Shiliu: ...You dress funny, are you a traveler? Fair enough... I guess now you're going to tell me that these are no use to you on your travels anyway. Right?
Shiliu: *sigh* ...I totally misjudged this one. I thought I could increase sales by moving into Mondstadt...
Shiliu: Little did I know, people here would sooner spend every last Mora to their name at the tavern than take a look at what I'm selling...
Shiliu: Maybe they just can't afford it? Hmm... I suppose not everywhere is as affluent as Liyue...
