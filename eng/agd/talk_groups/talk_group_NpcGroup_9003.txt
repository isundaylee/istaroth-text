## Talk

Jean: #Let the wind lead, Traveler.

## Talk

Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Jean: It is very comfortable here.
Jean: The air is fresh and the environment is restful.
Jean: It is also very quiet. I think I will be able to concentrate and get a lot of work done here.
Traveler: Why are you still working...
Jean: Hmm? Is that not alright?
Traveler: You should try to enjoy yourself here.
Jean: Thank you...
Jean: I'll be sure to keep your suggestion firmly in mind.
Traveler: You should try to enjoy this place.

## Talk

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Jean: Of course, it's always a pleasure to be in your company.
Jean: Is there a particular topic that you wish to discuss?
Traveler: Anything, except work...
Jean: I apologize... Evidently, I talk about work so much that it gets quite exasperating for the people around me.
Jean: I will think on this.
Traveler: Jean, no need to take it so seriously...
Jean: I—I am sorry...
Jean: I understand. You mean to say that we should be more informal in the way we interact with each other.
Jean: O—Okay, I...
Jean: I will do my best...
Traveler: I've heard that you sing quite well?
Jean: ...Only a few simple songs.
Jean: It's really nothing to brag about.
Traveler: I want to hear you sing.
Jean: Ah, um... But I'm completely unprepared...
Jean: At the very least, let me practice first.
Traveler: If that works for you, it works for me.

## Talk

Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Jean: Perhaps you could join me for a walk?
Jean: I have taken what you said recently to heart and tried to make a few adjustments in my life.
Jean: Of course, I still push myself to complete my work when performing my official duties.
Jean: But when I'm with you, I'm now able to unwind.
Traveler: Sounds like you're making great progress.
Jean: This is all thanks to you...
Jean: This whole time, you have been a great companion to me. You are always so considerate of my circumstances.
Jean: It would be shameful if I didn't at least recognize this much.
Jean: So, thank you. Truly.
Traveler: You look beautiful when you smile.
Traveler: I should thank you, too.
Jean: ...
Jean: We... should walk while we talk.
Jean: I still have so much I want to say to you.
Traveler: I'm happy to hear that.

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Jean.
Jean: #Good morning, Traveler.
Jean: I wish you a successful journey.
Jean: If there is anything I can assist with, please do not hesitate to ask.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Jean.
Jean: Good night. Try not to stay up too late...
Jean: ...as you often remind me yourself.

## Talk

Jean: I never thought that such a perfect study could exist outside the Knights of Favonius headquarters.
Jean: I would certainly feel at ease here, whether it be while reading or working.
Jean: Thank you, Honorary Knight. I am very satisfied.

## Talk

Jean: Whenever I go for a stroll around Mondstadt and see the citizens happy and free, I feel deeply inspired.
Jean: The Knights perform our duty precisely so that the city's residents may live in peace.
Jean: The atmosphere in this park is excellent. Thank you...
