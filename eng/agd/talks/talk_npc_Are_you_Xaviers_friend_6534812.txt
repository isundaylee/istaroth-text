Traveler: Are you Xavier's friend?
Goldoni: Y... Yes! Aâ€”Also, we grew up together. I've known him since I was three!
Goldoni: *sigh* If only I knew the first thing about mechanisms. That way, I could've gone with him to Inazuma without anyone batting an eyelid...
Goldoni: Maybe I'd even be able to join his Daydream Club and speak with him more...
Goldoni: *cough* I mean, I could write more work that suits his requirements. I mean, the more commissions I do for him, the more perfect the scripts I'll write... right?
