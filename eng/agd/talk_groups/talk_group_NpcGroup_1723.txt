Paimon: #Look, Traveler, a treasure chest!
Paimon: So beautifully decorated and in such an unmissable spot... Almost as if it's trying to tempt us into opening it!
Traveler: Maybe the key's somewhere nearby?
Paimon: Let's have a look around, we might be able to find it. Wonder what kind of treasure it's hiding...
Traveler: Probably better not to touch it.
Paimon: Yâ€”You've got a point. After all, barging into someone's room uninvited, opening a treasure chest that they've gone to the trouble of locking, then running off with said treasure... It doesn't sound very nice put like that, does it?
Paimon: Anyway, we should tell Jean first, right?
