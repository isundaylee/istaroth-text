Traveler: So, who's getting the credit?
Kaji: Ha! You think the Shogunate would believe that the two of us took care of the Tatarigami by ourselves?
Kaji: All they'll do is credit this whole thing to Her Excellency and sing songs about it in Tenshukaku...
Kaji: I'm just a worker seeking refuge with them. None of that credit's shining down on me, I'll tell you that much.
Kaji: Oh well, it's not like I care about it anyway. We workers from the mines just see it as helping others. Them city folks wouldn't understand.
