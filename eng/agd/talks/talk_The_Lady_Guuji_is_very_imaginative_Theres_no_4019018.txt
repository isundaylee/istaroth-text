Kamisato Ayato: The Lady Guuji is very... imaginative. There's no telling how the festival will end up in the end.
Traveler: She can be a handful...
Kamisato Ayato: I wouldn't go that far. Though outlandish at times, her ideas usually contain strokes of genius that can be quite practical in the end.
Kamisato Ayato: Besides, with you and Ayaka involved in the event, trust that I will intervene if things get out of hand. You need not worry.
