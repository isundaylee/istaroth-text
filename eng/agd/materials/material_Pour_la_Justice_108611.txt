# "Pour la Justice"

Furina's specialty. "Pour la Justice" means "veneration of justice" in Fontaine, and she who once performed on the greatest of stages bore witness to the birth of sublime justice. Its layered flavors seem to swell and fade like the waves of the sea, before finally relaxing as though laying down a heavy burden. Perhaps it reflects something she personally experienced?
