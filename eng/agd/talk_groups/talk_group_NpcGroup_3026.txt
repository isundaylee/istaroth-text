Traveler: The only one left?
Sanada: I have a comrade who was supposed to stand on guard with me, but he always abandons his post. If I don't pay special attention, he tends to just leave me on duty here alone.
Sanada: I'm debating if I should report this to our superior...

Traveler: Have you ever seen someone who looks like me?
Sanada: I can't really say. There are way too many people coming in and out of Hanamizaka. And I'm usually the only one on duty. How can I possibly remember that?
Sanada: Gee, can't people just do their job properly...
