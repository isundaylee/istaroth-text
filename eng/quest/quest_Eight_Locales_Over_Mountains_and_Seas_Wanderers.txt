# Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas: Wanderer's Appraisal


## Talk 1

"Kichiboushi": This city is very big, but... feels grim.
Paimon: We came here before with a lot of companions, and we fought a battle against Stormterror.
"Kichiboushi": Is Stormterror a large, sharp-tooth, scary dragon with flip-flap wings?
Traveler: Well, he wasn't that scary.
Paimon: Do you still remember that Anemo Archon statue we saw in Mondstadt?
"Kichiboushi": Anemo Archon Statue...?
Paimon: That big, tall stone statue.
"Kichiboushi": Mm! Yes! Anemo Archon had big hands!
Paimon: Stormterror is the archon's good friend! Long ago, the Anemo Archon was from this city, too...
"Kichiboushi": Ooh!
"Kichiboushi": But if Storm-Storm is so big, how does he get in here?
Traveler: You know, this question feels familiar...
Paimon: Paimon knows this one! That's because he doesn't walk in...
"Kichiboushi": Ooh, Kichiboushi knows. Storm-Storm can fly. Does not need walking.
Paimon: A—Argh! How...
"Kichiboushi": Mm? Paimon, you seem a little unhappiness.
Paimon: Eh... We can talk about that later. First off, let's take a photo! Alright, stand still now!
"Kichiboushi": Kichiboushi stand straight!
Traveler: It's "Stormterror."
Traveler: He was quite lovely, actually.

## Talk 2

"Kichiboushi": Mm... Very nice...
Paimon: What's wrong, Kichiboushi?
"Kichiboushi": This is a grim city. Very sad, don't know why. Strange.
Traveler: I feel the same way.
Paimon: Next up, let's head into the center of this "city"...
Traveler: That's rather odd, Kichiboushi.

## Talk 3

"Kichiboushi": Mmmph! The wind... strong...
Paimon: We can't pass through these storm-walls. We've got to go around!
Paimon: Easy now, Kichiboushi, just follow us around.

## Talk 4

Paimon: We're finally here!
Paimon: The view's much better up here. Look over there — that's the spot where we came from!
"Kichiboushi": Paimon likes high spots, mm?
Traveler: You can see everything from these vantage points, and they are good for gliding, too.
"Kichiboushi": Does Storm-Storm sleep here?
Paimon: Yup — for a really long time, too.
Paimon: #Even though Traveler fought Stormterror, he's not a bad dragon.
Paimon: He just experienced something terrible, got hurt, and was tricked by bad people, so he thought that his friend, the Anemo Archon, no longer needed him.
"Kichiboushi": Mm... Then what happened?
Paimon: #After that, huh? Do you remember, Traveler?
Traveler: I purified his poisoned blood during our battle.
Paimon: But the platform we were battling on collapsed. At first, it looked like we and the Anemo Archon were going to fall into a deep, dark place...
"Kichiboushi": Eek! That's horrible... What did you do? Did you fly away?
Traveler: Dvalin saved us, and he bore us away.
"Kichiboushi": Dva...?
Paimon: That's Stormterror's name.
Paimon: #Stormterror actually had a name of his own, just like Kichiboushi, Paimon, and Traveler — and his name is Dvalin.
Paimon: At first, Dvalin was injured and tricked by some bad people, so he was very angry. That's why he attacked Mondstadt, and because everyone thought he was a bad dragon, they called him "Stormterror."
Paimon: Later, we beat those bad people and helped the Anemo Archon purify the blood that was tainting him. That was when he realized that the archon hadn't abandoned him.
"Kichiboushi": Ooh! So Storm-Storm became good again!
Paimon: Exactly! And that's why Paimon brought you here for training today — it was to tell you the story of Dvalin.
Paimon: When you grow older, you will also be misunderstood, get hurt, and experience sad things.
Paimon: But you mustn't become a bad person. Because "winds change their course"...
Traveler: And someday, they will blow towards a brighter future...
"Kichiboushi": Mm?
Traveler: Was that a bit tough to understand, Kichiboushi?
"Kichiboushi": Understand, but also not really...
"Kichiboushi": #But Kichiboushi knows that it is something important. Will not forgetting what Paimon and Traveler say.
Paimon: Hehe! Then at least our long storytelling session didn't go to waste!
Paimon: But whatever the case, make sure you don't become too playful or cheeky — that might get you sealed sometime in the future!
Traveler: Looks like this round of your training has drawn to a close.
"Kichiboushi": Mmmm...
Paimon: There's no need to be so sad! Smile as we go back, or you'll make Ioroi sad, too!
Paimon: Alright then. Guess we've gotta do our jobs as guides one last time, eh?
Paimon: Now then — time to bring Kichiboushi back to Ioroi!
Traveler: Let's move out.
"Kichiboushi": Mm.
Traveler: Let's go, Kichiboushi.
Traveler: Seems like we've completed Ioroi's commission.
Traveler: Stormterror saved us and bore us away from the battle.
Traveler: You know what they say about "idiots and smoke..."
Paimon: That's not what this is about! You can see everything from up here, and the air is great, too.

## Talk 5

Paimon: We're back, Ioroi!
Ioroi: Ooh, you've finally returned! How has Kichiboushi's training gone?
"Kichiboushi": Squelch squelch, kapow!
Ioroi: Mmhahaha! Good, good!
Paimon: Oh brother, we can't understand Kichiboushi anymore...
Paimon: We even took a lot of photos. Have a look, Ioroi...
Black Screen Text: You show all the photos you took for Kichiboushi during this time to Ioroi.
You also tell him about your adventures.
Paimon: ...And that's how we completed your request to "take Kichiboushi to eight places to train," Ioroi.
Ioroi: Mm! Good, very good, as might be expected of humans I had mine eye on. If you were also tanuki, you would be great and renowned indeed. Perhaps half as great as I when put together!
Paimon: (That's not super impressive...)
Paimon: But since we've completed the task, we should probably leave now.
"Kichiboushi": Mmmph...
Paimon: Oh, don't be like that. Come on, Kichiboushi, Paimon's gonna teach you one more thing!
Paimon: When you say goodbye to friends, you should see them off with a smile! That way, you'll be even happier when you meet again.
Ioroi: ...Mm? Alright. Sure. Leave it to me.
Ioroi: Kichiboushi says, "Got it, White Fur."
Paimon: Eh? Does this mean...
Traveler: Kichiboushi's lost his ability to speak?
Ioroi: It has been some time. The effects of the tanuki meal must have worn off.
Ioroi: Hmph! If I were free from this stone seal, it would be a thing of ease to have you understand tanuki speech all the time...
Ioroi: ...Hmm? Of course, I will pass it on.
Ioroi: "Kichiboushi train hard."
Ioroi: "Become strong bake-danuki, like Ioroi!"
Ioroi: Mm? Hahaha! That's quite the boast, you little rascal. Reminds me of myself when I was your age!
Ioroi: "Then White Fur and Yellow Fur no eat bake-danuki food, understand Kichiboushi."
Paimon: We'll be waiting, Kichiboushi! We'll come train with you next time, too.
Traveler: Good luck, Kichiboushi.
Traveler: Don't get sealed by humans, now.
Ioroi: Mm!?
"Kichiboushi": Mm!
Ioroi: Eh, forget it. I shall not pursue the matter, considering that you did take Kichiboushi out to train.
Ioroi: Ah, yes. There was once this fellow called Utamarou who painted the tanuki sealed in Chinju Forest and left some drafts behind.
Ioroi: You can have it, to look upon whenever you wish to remember the handsome forms of the tanuki race!
Ioroi: *sigh* If only you, too, were tanuki...
Traveler: Wouldn't we have been turned into stone already, then?
Ioroi: Mmph, true. Well then, off you go now. I have a little magic to teach Kichiboushi.
Traveler: We've lost the ability to understand Kichiboushi's speech?
