# Pigeons Go AWOL


## Talk 1

Draff: Regarding these pigeons...
Draff: They'd be more use to me roasted with a few wild mushrooms...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Draff: I raised them as carrier pigeons, to deliver messages.
Draff: But for some reason they are getting less and less reliable.
Draff: Either they lose the message or they glide around for hours but never actually deliver it. Or, they sit around the whole time just waiting for someone to chase them off.
Draff: If you have time, maybe you could hurry along the pigeons I just released.
Traveler: Got it.
Draff: Great. So if you see any of them slacking off, chase them away for me.
Traveler: I seek not the enmity of pigeons.
Draff: Don't worry, it's not like pigeons to hold a grudge. Their memory is much too short for that.
Draff: I never had you down as such a pigeon lover...

## Talk 2

Draff: Regarding these pigeons...
Draff: Maybe now they'll deliver their messages without a fuss in future...
Draff: But I can't exactly follow them and check... Anyway, that'll do for now.
Draff: For your trouble, please take this. And if you ever need to send a message, just come and find me.

## Talk 3

Draff: Regarding these pigeons...
Draff: You did WHAT? How could you!? They were my carrier pigeons!
Draff: You churlish imbecile... hilichurlish, even! What am I going to do about all these letters!?
Traveler: Sowwie...
Draff: Is that the best you can do? A Knight of Flaming Favonius and the best you can offer is a half-hearted apology!?
Draff: You've really fluffed up here, and now you have to make it right. Since you're so bird-brained anyway, I trust you will have no problem being my new carrier pigeon!
Traveler: Sometimes I don't know my own strength...
Draff: It helps if you don't chase them off with a flaming meat cleaver!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Eh, what's this? ...A message?
Paimon: Shoot, one of the pigeons must have dropped it on the way...
Paimon: #Traveler, see who the sender is. Maybe we can sort this out.

## Talk 5

Draff: Regarding these pigeons...
Draff: The hilichurls have an insatiable appetite for avian messengers? Are you serious...
Draff: Well, I suppose they are getting plump, and would probably make a great pairing with a glass of jagerschnapps...
Draff: ...I mean, uh... Oh drats, now I have to raise a whole new flock of pigeons.

## Talk 6

Draff: Regarding these pigeons...
Draff: The hilichurls have an insatiable appetite for avian messengers? Are you serious...
Traveler: Is this letter yours?
Draff: A letter? Ah yes, I sent this! It was supposed to go to Sister Grace, in the city.
Draff: You didn't read it, did you? Not that it matters anyway, it's all stuff that happened years ago.
Draff: With some things, you can't leave them in the dark forever...
Draff: Thank you for bringing it all this way, I'll run it down to the city myself some time. Here's a small reward for finding it...
Draff: Timmie, hey Timmie...

## Talk 7

Draff: These pigeons are getting plumper by the day... What is Allan feeding them?

## Talk 8

Sara: Chirp chirp, I have a letter for you.
Sara: Oh! I never expected you to be the one delivering this!
Sara: I thought it would be a carrier pigeon, like usual.
Sara: But as long as it's delivered I'm happy. Thanks!

## Talk 9

Draff: Regarding these pigeons...
Draff: Goodness... The devil makes work for idle hands, eh.
Draff: Alright, well never mind. I'll let you off this once. Off you go now.
