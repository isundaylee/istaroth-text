Flo: Ah, I heard about what happened from Virda. Thank you for saving her!
Flo: Sorry for the trouble my little sister caused you. I'll remind her to stay safe in the future...
Flo: Oh dear. How could I ever thank you? ... Oh, I know! Why don't I help you design a set of clothes?
Flo: Really, though, I'm only any good at sewing... So how would tights do? I've heard that the thieves and heroes in those stories all love wearing them...
