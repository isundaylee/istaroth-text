# Ballads of Breeze

Lizzie: Hello there, have you been enjoying the Windblume festivities?
Traveler: Thanks to your recommendations, yes.
Lizzie: Hehe, I have another event for you that's quite relaxing. It's called "Ballads of Breeze."
Lizzie: I'm sure you've seen the bards of Mondstadt. Taking part in this event will allow you to play lovely songs, just like they do!
Lizzie: Feel the breath of the wind atop mountains and beside rivers, and put your heart and soul into playing your tune. It's a surefire way to forget all your worries!
Traveler: But I've got no experience in this field...
Lizzie: Don't worry. This activity was designed precisely such that those without any performance experience can savor the joys of music.
Lizzie: As long as you can keep up with the hints and the beat, there should be no problem.
Traveler: That's reassuring.
Lizzie: Of course. Happy Windblume Festival!
Traveler: Well, guess I'll give it a go.
Traveler: Will it really sound alright?
Traveler: Haven't had time yet.
