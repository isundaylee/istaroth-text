## Talk

Traveler: Is there anything of note nearby?

## Talk

Kazim: All is well... lately, anyway. The White Lift is functioning well enough, but we shouldn't get careless just the same.

## Talk

Kazim: We must check on the White Lift every morning and every night.

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Kazim: I watch over the White Lift. I'm also in charge of its maintenance and repair.
Kazim: This machine is very important to the village's water supply. Before it was built, we had to get our water one bucket at a time.
Kazim: Its critical importance is precisely why I am planning to secure its future while I still can.
Kazim: Fortunately, my son Kazan, unlike many other young people, has not left the village to become a mercenary or a traveling merchant. As such, I'm planning to pass everything I know onto him.
Kazim: That way, he can take over in case I become unable to work.

## Talk

Traveler: See you around.
Kazim: Goodbye. Always be prepared for a rainy day!

## Talk

Traveler: So, what's the White Lift, exactly?
Kazim: This elevator was built with the help of a Village Keeper a long time ago.
Kazim: You know of Village Keepers, yes? Those are the mad researchers exiled here by the Akademiya.
Kazim: They're a little batty most of the time, but sometimes, they'll pull themselves together and help us out.
Kazim: Anyway, back to the White Lift. The Village Keeper who helped build it is said to have been a Kshahrewar researcher. In fact, some people wanted to name the machine the Kshahrewar Lift at first.
Kazim: But I'm sure you know how things have always been a bit testy between Aaru Village and the Akademiya. I doubt that name would have gone down well with everyone.
Kazim: So in the end, we just named it after the color that represents Kshahrewar — and that's how it became known as the White Lift.

## Talk

Traveler: I see.
Kazim: The longer I work at this job, the more I come to think that everything should be planned out in advance, with contingencies to match.
Kazim: I'm very grateful to the Village Keepers for their aid, but we can't always rely on them.
Kazim: Preventing problems before they can occur is the safest way to go about things.
Kazim: That applies to you, too, I believe. There are always times when we need to do some repairs outdoors, so take this — better safe than sorry.
