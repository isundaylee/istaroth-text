Yumemizuki Mizuki: Remember, there's no need to rush. Push yourself too hard, and all that stress will give you nightmares.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: And nightmares will absolutely sap your energy!
Yumemizuki Mizuki: So, take it easy. If your body's telling you to rest, you need to listen. You can take a nap right here next to me, how about that?

## Talk

Yumemizuki Mizuki: It's a completely different feeling... fighting here.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: It's so different from dealing with nightmares. It almost feels like... dancing in a dream or enjoying some kind of impromptu performance.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I suppose this is as good a place as any to get some combat experience. Once we're done here, we should go for a soak in the hot springs.

Yumemizuki Mizuki: If you think about it... Could this play be a part of a dream?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Fascinating... Dreams tend to exist on a binary â€” either dark or light, with notes of bitterness or joy... Yet, this dream defies my attempts to understand it.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: With you to guide me, I'm eager to venture further into this place and discover the colors at the heart of this dream.
