# Talk Dialog

Paimon: This should be the place... That guy looks official. Let's go ask him.
Paimon: Hi there! We're looking for Emura Ichigensai, are we in the rightâ€”
Kanai: Pay first, take a ticket, then wait your turn.
Paimon: Oh, okay...
Paimon: Ninety-seven... What number are you up to so far?
Kanai: Fifty-three. Be patient. I'll call your number when it's your turn.
Paimon: Geez, what a charmer... Looks like we're in for a long wait, huh?
Traveler: Shall I knock him out, so we can barge straight in?
Paimon: Sounds kinda therapeutic in its own way... But we don't really have a good excuse to resort to violence here. And we definitely don't wanna scare off our target.
Paimon: Why don't we pass the time by talking to some of his other patients? It looks like there's a few of them standing over there.
Traveler: Shall we talk to the other patients while we wait?
Paimon: Hey, good idea! Hmm, it looks like there's a few of them over there. Let's go see what we can find out.
