Traveler: Who are you?
Harris: The name's Harris. I'm a chef and the person who built this camp.
Harris: I came here to help the adventurers in the area, to make sure they can get a bowl of hot soup at the end of a long day of adventure.
Harris: I reckon there's no greater joy than the feeling of hot soup in your system when you're just about frozen stiff.
Harris: The essence of the culinary pursuit is to bring people satisfaction and joy, is it not?
Harris: It's a shame that lots of chefs have forgotten this... Personally, I was taught this simple principle by a young female chef who I met by chance while traveling in Liyue.
