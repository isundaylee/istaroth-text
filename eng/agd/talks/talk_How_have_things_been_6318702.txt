Traveler: How have things been?
Anisa: Haha, good, good! Thanks for your concern!
Anisa: The weather here's good, the environment's pretty nice, and the food's just the best. Also, thanks to Little Kumi's care, I've had all the time and energy in the world to focus on my research!
Anisa: It's just that... I guess I worry her a bit when I go running around.
Anisa: Hehehe, I actually do feel a bit bad about it.
