Makhfi: I didn't expect Tighnari, who rarely shows himself in the city, to participate in the Interdarshan Championship.
Makhfi: I don't know much about Tighnari. He doesn't strike me as someone who is fame-hungry... Perhaps too many people were recommending him, and he didn't want to disappoint them.
Makhfi: Speaking of which, I think he's planning to hold a new lecture next month.
Makhfi: I must note down the time of his lecture before I forget... I can't miss it!
