Traveler: You want to learn as well?
Kaan: Of course! Don't you want to learn it too? It's just so cool!
Kaan: You can find dance competitions at Stage Tepetl every day. I really want to join one when I grow up, so everyone can cheer for me when I win too!
Kaan: I'll work hard as I grow! One of these days, I'll grow taller than the stage and stronger than the DJ, and that'll be the day I'll beat everyone on the stage!

Traveler: Remember to stretch properly before practice.
Kaan: I know, I know... That's what my Mom always says too. I'll take care of myself!
Kaan: After all, I don't just want to become an excellent dancer â€” I want to become a brave and mighty warrior, too!
Kaan: Just... Just like Kachina!
Kaan: Ah... Speaking of Kachina, I still haven't practiced the moves she taught me last time...
