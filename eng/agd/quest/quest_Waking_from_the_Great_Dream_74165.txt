# Waking from the Great Dream


## Talk 1

Paimon: Is this... the Primordial Sea?

## Talk 2

Narzissenkreuz (???): The day of return has arrived...
Paimon: Wh—Who was that?

## Talk 3

Narzissenkreuz: Impossible... I had already reached the stage of "no return." How have I fallen to this point?
Narzissenkreuz: And I have lost all control of the Primordial Sea.
Narzissenkreuz: Why, why has this happened? Why, why did you do this?
Narzissenkreuz: The new world cannot be born. All will die in a shell, a husk of a dream!
Paimon: Paimon reckons you're the one who should try waking up from your dream.
Paimon: The end of the world is the kind of thing that everyone should work together to stop.
Narzissenkreuz: I see. The Holy Blade is not on my side. With each swing, it cuts through the universal will that surrounds me.
Narzissenkreuz: Until, at last, my weak, ordinary self has returned to its physical body.
Traveler: The Primordial Sea won't overflow its banks so soon.
Narzissenkreuz: Indeed, I can sense changes in the values originally entered into the world-formula.
Narzissenkreuz: Someone has seized control of the life-force, and someone has opened the beast-realm.
Narzissenkreuz: And then, there is one more variable. That is you.
Narzissenkreuz: The person fated to see the all-consuming whale put to flight. The one who shall witness all.
Narzissenkreuz: I see, I see.
Narzissenkreuz: I once dreamed of becoming one just like you. But that dream is now shattered.
Narzissenkreuz: All I have done is meaningless. An empty dream.
Narzissenkreuz: No, less than a dream, even. A dream is at least harmless. But I... No, you, and they... have paid so much for all I have done.
Ann: Narzissenkreuz.
Narzissenkreuz: Oh, it's you. I didn't see you there.
Ann: Do you know who I actually am?
Narzissenkreuz: Names are just labels. But yes, I am most familiar with the two colors that mix in your soul.
Narzissenkreuz: Director Lyris does not know what has happened. She just holds onto Mary-Ann, who herself still clings to life.
Narzissenkreuz: She cannot understand such a complex present and future, and hopes just to retain the past. And so, she does the only thing she can.
Ann: My name is Ann.
Narzissenkreuz: In that case, hello, Ann.
Ann: I am willing to forgive you.
Narzissenkreuz: What an odd thing to say. From the very start, my plans have had lofty and sacred aims. Selfishness has never come into it.
Narzissenkreuz: None may judge or criticize me, nor do I need forgiveness.
Ann: Your aims may have been lofty, but your insanity has harmed many.
Ann: You did not even enter the formula correctly... and what's wrong with being forgiven for a mistake?
Narzissenkreuz: ...You are right. I apologize.
Ann: So please, Narzissenkreuz, come back with us. There are other people you need to see.
Paimon: This guy seems to have become much more cooperative. But a request like that...
Narzissenkreuz: Of course.
Paimon: Huh? Doesn't this sorta thing usually require some inner struggle and hours of persuasion?
Narzissenkreuz: As I have said before, I do not feel that I have done anything wrong. My mission has failed, but the world is still fated to be saved.
Narzissenkreuz: Let others mock and curse me. I am empty within now. Only one desire remains.
Paimon: What is it?
Narzissenkreuz: I, too, wish to return to the very beginning — to the time before the Narzissenkreuz heroes set off on their journey.
Narzissenkreuz: But that's impossible. We are not masters of our own fate. I no longer even have the power to determine my own dreams.
Ann: #Well, Knight Traveler, when you're ready, we'll proceed to reseal the primordial waters, and then we'll leave this place.
