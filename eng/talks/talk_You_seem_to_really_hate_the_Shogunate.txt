Traveler: You seem to really hate the Shogunate.
Ooizumi: Of course. If I didn't, why would I be with the resistance?
Ooizumi: I can't put up with the Shogunate's actions. They only care about raising taxes and suppressing the commoners instead of doing productive things. The Vision Hunt Decree was just the final straw, that's all. There are a ton of other reasons why everyone hates them.
Ooizumi: Ever since the war started, we've constantly had to regroup after just a few battles. I have no clue when we'll finally win.
Ooizumi: Because I can't defy my orders, I can't really do anything, even though I just want to annihilate the entire Shogunate, even if I had to do it by myself. For now, I'm a scout on front line, observing the movements of the Shogun's Army.
