Traveler: How've you been lately?
Hiiragi Chisato: Things at the estate are far more complicated than I could have anticipated. I haven't quite gotten the hang of it all just yet.
Hiiragi Chisato: Thankfully, everyone's been quite willing to listen to my suggestions, so I can start from the simplest matters and slowly sort everything out from there.
Hiiragi Chisato: The more I do this, the more I realize that these things are as urgent as they are laden with great meaning... and only I can do them.
Hiiragi Chisato: I'm glad we didn't end up sinking even deeper into the mire back there.
