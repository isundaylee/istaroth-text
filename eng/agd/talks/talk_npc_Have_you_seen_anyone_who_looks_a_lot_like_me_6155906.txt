Traveler: Have you seen anyone who looks a lot like me?
Lorgar: Someone like you? Why, yes, I believe I have...
Lorgar: A lot of young adventurers like you will come tramping into the Stormbearer Mountains. I turn most of them back, which is good, since it's quite dangerous up ahead...
Lorgar: Ohâ€” You're looking for a relative, then? I'm sorry, I misunderstood you.
Lorgar: I don't think the person you're looking for has come to the Stormbearer Mountains. Best you go look somewhere else.
