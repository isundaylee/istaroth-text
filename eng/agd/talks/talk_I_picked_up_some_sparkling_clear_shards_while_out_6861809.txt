Message: "I picked up some sparkling clear shards while out on the road before. They didn't look like obsidian, but smelled like some kind of strange grain. There were these mysterious letters written onto them, too."
Message: "I think those are Cotan Grapes... or something like that. I've looked through the old classics, but never seen anything like that. Is anyone familiar with this sort of gemstone?"
Another Person's Message: "Where did you pick them up?"
Message: "Quite a ways off the beaten path, I think it was near the high priestess Citlali's residence...?"
Another Person's Message: "I see. This is something that causes people to lose their minds, talk nonsense, and even start dancing strange jigs. Its craftsmanship can be traced back to ancient times. Don't touch it... and don't drink it either."
Message: "What do you mean, 'don't drink it'? Anyway, if they're the High Priestess's ritual implements, I'd better return them to her."
Granny Itztli's Message: "No! Nope! Absolutely not! It's got nothing to do with me! Just find a random place and chuck it out!"
