Luo Feng: Not many people realize this, but the true value of this Pearl Galley lies in its guests!
Luo Feng: Which of the people who come on board are not movers and shakers of a kind? If I can build rapport with but a few such people, then this trip would have been well worth it.
Luo Feng: Well then, I shan't tarry. I need to get to know some more of these people!
