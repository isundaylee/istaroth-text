# Talk Dialog

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Cyno: At first, I couldn't get used to how quiet it is here.
Cyno: There's no howling desert wind or sound of bugs skittering in the rainforest.
Cyno: When you're trying to get to sleep, it's so quiet and peaceful that you almost start wondering whether it's even real... which makes it hard to relax.
Traveler: Are you more used to it now?
Cyno: Yes. I just tell myself that I'm on a vacation and that I shouldn't worry about what's going on anywhere else.
Cyno: Though, of course, before bed every night I still reflect on my previous battles and review what I've learned.
Traveler: Have you managed to get any rest?
Cyno: Don't worry, I feel much more relaxed now than I was at the Akademiya.
Cyno: The point of rest is to relieve the stress and fatigue you've built up, it doesn't mean completely changing who you are.
Cyno: I really like it here. It's a place where I can finally enjoy a moment of peace. I'll use this time to revitalize myself and prepare for the next time I need to administer judgment.
