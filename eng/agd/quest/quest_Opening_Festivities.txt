# Opening Festivities


## Talk 1

Paimon: Looks like Kareena's got a moment now. Let's go chat with her!

## Talk 2

Paimon: The locator's going off!
Paimon: Looks like someone's already caught themselves a Swiftfly!

## Talk 3

Paimon: The locator's going off again...
Paimon: So someone else finished, too? That would mean that the one Layla's chasing is the last Swiftfly.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Kaveh, Faruzan, Layla!
Kaveh: Huh? Oh, it's you. Why're you here?
Paimon: We're here as specially invited guest commentators! Our job is to record what happens during the competition!
Faruzan: Is that so? In that case, I'll have to trouble you to catch the moment of my triumph on Kamera!
Faruzan: Remember to shoot from behind at a lower angle — you know, to capture a senior's class!
Kaveh: Don't get ahead of yourself, now. Victory will obviously be mine!
Faruzan: Hah, you're far too young to even consider challenging me. Kshahrewar or Rtawahist, you're all children as far as I'm concerned...
Layla: A—Actually, I was going to ask... How do you know me, Madam Faruzan?
Faruzan: Hmm? You don't remember? I sometimes see you in the library at night. You even waved at me!
Layla: What...? I don't remember doing that at all!
Faruzan: How strange... However, this is not the time for curiosity. I am Faruzan, a household name in Haravatat. You are Layla from Rtawahist, I presume?
Layla: Y—Yes.
Faruzan: Good, then we are officially introduced. See? Simple as that.
Faruzan: I like respectful ones, by the way. Would you like to join my research group?
Kaveh: Madam Faruzan... I'm quite sure this counts as poaching. Let's dial things down...
Faruzan: I know, but it's been tough getting people these days, and research funding has been hard to secure...
Faruzan: But once I win this tournament, it'll be a different story...
Paimon: So you're just here to increase the amount of funding you're getting?
Faruzan: Well, not just that... What, are you curious about my reasons for participating in this event?
Faruzan: Well, I suppose that's to be expected. You are our guest commentators, after all.
Faruzan: There's been an influx of newly enrolled students, and they'll be paying close attention to this competition. If I do win, I'm certain that there will be no lack of students knocking upon my door.
Faruzan: Moreover, research resources will be made available to the victor, so that will nix my funding issues. Therefore, my two juniors, I do apologize, but I fully intend to emerge triumphant.
Layla: I—I'll do my best as well. At least, I don't plan to lose too badly...
Paimon: So why are you here, Layla?
Layla: I don't know why, but a lot of people recommended me. I didn't sign up myself. I just woke up to find my name on the announcement board.
Paimon: That sounds like what happened to Tighnari!
Layla: Him too?
Layla: I'm... I'm really nervous. I've been so worried about disappointing everyone that I've been losing sleep...
Faruzan: Stress not, young one. We must all experience failure to grow and mature.
Layla: But Madam Faruzan, I don't want to fail...
Kaveh: Tch, seriously? Everyone has such nice reasons for joining.
Traveler: And what's your story, Kaveh?
Kaveh: Must I say?
Paimon: Yes, you do! We gotta record it!
Kaveh: Um, well... You know, right? I want to buy some property...
Paimon: Ooh, that's right! You want to move out of Alhaitham's—
Kaveh: *coughing* What!? Alhaitham? What about him!? This has nothing to do with him!
Traveler: Paimon's misremembering things.
Paimon: Oh...! Right! Sorry, Paimon has no idea what she was talking about...
Paimon: So, you want to use the grand prize to buy a place, right?
Kaveh: Correct. Also, my father took part in the Interdarshan Championship when I was young, but he didn't win.
Kaveh: Once I do, the right to wear that diadem will be mine. In a way, I'll be helping my father fulfill a dream of his.
Faruzan: That's not a bad reason at all. You have ambition, youngster.
Faruzan: Although your chances with me here aren't great, I believe your father would be most proud if the Diadem of Knowledge were bestowed upon you.
Kaveh: ...Not that he'll have the chance to celebrate. My father passed away many years ago. They say he ran into quicksand while traveling in the desert.
Faruzan: For you to have experienced such a thing... That must have been tough for you.
Kaveh: ...
Kaveh: It's all in the past now, and life goes on, doesn't it? Let's change topics — I don't want to bring the mood down.
Faruzan: Alright. Earlier, you said that you want to use the prize Mora to purchase a home. Where do you live now, do you live alone?
Kaveh: *cough* Well...
Faruzan: Hmm... I also heard you mention "Alhaitham" just a moment ago. Isn't he also from Haravatat? Are you two hiding something from me?
Kaveh: No, of course not! Why would you think that? Hahaha...
Paimon: Paimon's definitely not involved, either! We're gonna go interview other contestants now! Bye!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Um, so... what... what, uh...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Just call me Hat Guy. That's the name I use in Vahumana.
Paimon: That sounds like a nickname, not a real name!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: So I can't go by a simple, ordinary name?
Paimon: Fine, suit yourself. Alright then, Hat Guy, why are you taking part in the Interdarshan Championship?
Paimon: We're specially invited guest commentators, so play nice and answer our questions.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: You could be matra for all I care. So what if I don't answer you? What then?
Paimon: You...!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Hmph, I'll tell you this much: I have an agreement with someone not to reveal my motives.
Paimon: You're not plotting something in secret, are you?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Well, it's hard to say. Why don't you take a guess?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon's had it with you!
Paimon: Fine, be that way! Then we won't ask you why you're participating. Instead... Uh, why did you join Vahumana?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: You two sure like to poke your noses where they don't belong. If I don't say anything, are you going to annoy me to death?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...I heard that the Vahumana researcher named Aqaba was researching the Tatarasuna incident, so I wrote a few essays to refute his points.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Later, when I was bored, I wrote some commentary on societal issues in Inazuma. I didn't expect Vahumana to consider me as one of them. Someone even invited me to a lecture or whatever.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: From start to finish, it was just the wishful thinking of idiots — a misunderstanding. There's your answer. Simple.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: But when Lesser Lord Kusanali heard about this, she went out of her way to get me registered in Vahumana... She used the name "Hat Guy."
Traveler: So it was Nahida's doing...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Enough chit-chat. You're better off wasting your time with the other contestants.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Someone's about to get very unlucky — wanna guess who?
Paimon: How is anyone supposed to relax with you around!?
Paimon: We've gotta stay alert and keep a close eye on him!

## Talk 6

Kareena: Ah, you must be the guest commentators Wiqas invited. I've heard about you.
Kareena: I saw you two having quite the lively conversation, so I thought it would be best to wait. Are you two free right now?
Paimon: We were actually looking for you, too!
Kareena: Excellent! Then, please allow me to explain your job responsibilities in detail.
Kareena: First, please take these two things.
Kareena: The first item is a custom Kamera from the Akademiya. Please use it to record the competition as it unfolds.
Kareena: The second is an event-specific locator that will flag all participants' locations. It will also sound when one of them completes an objective.
Paimon: Wow, what a convenient little thing!
Kareena: Aside from you two, there are two other commentators. However, they will remain by the commentators' area and will not be following the contestants in real time.
Kareena: Speaking of which, you probably know them... Alhaitham and Nilou.
Paimon: Ohhh, it's them! We have to go over and say hi later!
Kareena: Well, don't let me keep you, unless you have any questions for me?
Traveler: Have you seen a white-haired man around?
Kareena: Hm? Why do you ask?
Traveler: I saw someone like that on the stage earlier.
Kareena: Really? I didn't see any such person. Could I ask when you saw him?
Traveler: Just before the Akademiya representatives went on stage.
Kareena: Strange... I was on stage the entire time, and I didn't see anyone come up.
Paimon: Paimon didn't see anyone, either!
Kareena: Hehe, perhaps you're mistaken. However, if you have any leads on that matter, you can talk to me at any time—
Dehya: #Hey, Traveler, Paimon! Long time no see!
Paimon: Dehya, Candace! You two are here as well!
Kareena: Ah, so they're two friends of yours? In that case, I'll take my leave. May you all have a wonderful time during the Extravaganza!
Candace: The Akademiya sent us both invitations, so Dehya suggested that we come together.
Candace: The villagers were also encouraging me to travel outside the village. I couldn't find it in myself to turn them down...
Dehya: We're here now, so no point dwelling on that. Even though this Extravaganza isn't a holiday or anything, it's still a big deal here in Sumeru.
Dehya: Merchants from all over will set up shop. There'll be tons of stuff to eat, use, and wear... More than you can count!
Dehya: I'm already set on helping you buy two new outfits. I mean, who wears the same thing at work and home, anyway?
Candace: I'm looking forward to it. Ah... Just being able to relax and wander the streets freely has already made my day.
Dehya: #So, Traveler, Paimon, you two wanna come with?
Paimon: Agh, we'd love to... but we've got work to do right now!
Dehya: Aw, that's a shame. Let's hang out together when you're free, then.
Paimon: Sure!
Dehya: In that case, Candace and I will head out first. Good clothing and fabrics are very much in demand — if you snooze, you lose! Oh, right, we should also get some accessories...
Candace: No need to rush. I think we'll have a better time if we take things slow.
Candace: See you two later. Feel free to come find us whenever you have the time.
Paimon: Paimon didn't think that Candace and Dehya would come. Hanging out with them sounds like a great time! Still, looks like the competition's starting soon. Let's go over to where Alhaitham is and see what's going on.

## Talk 7

Alhaitham: I will now announce the rules for the first round of the competition. Please listen carefully!
Alhaitham: During the opening ceremony, Akademiya staff released several cages of butterflies, and many of them are now fluttering within Sumeru City.
Alhaitham: Amongst these butterflies, three of them will be special Swiftflies. They have a different appearance and also fly a little faster.
Alhaitham: Your objective this round is to find a Swiftfly and bring it to me. Three points will be awarded to the first participant to return, two to the second, and one point to the third.
Alhaitham: That is all for the first round. Should you require clarification on anything, please ask any of the other staff.
Paimon: Alhaitham's all business all the time, huh?
Paimon: Hmm. That said, how did he get picked to be a commentator? Paimon's kinda curious...
Layla: Finding three specific butterflies in a place as large as Sumeru City sounds rather improbable...
Tighnari: If these Swiftflies behave anything like regular butterflies...
Cyno: I'm off. It will take some time to search every corner of Sumeru City.
Kaveh: Huh? You're going, just like that?
Cyno: A champion walks the road to victory!
Faruzan: My dear Kshahrewar junior, I have a plan. How about some cooperation between you and me?
Kaveh: Cooperation?
Paimon: Looks like everyone's got their own plans for this toughie.
Paimon: We're supposed to go on stage next, right? Uh, let's wait and see everyone's reactions first.
Paimon: Huh? Wait a minute, look! He seems to be observing the other contestants, just like we are!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...Hmph.
Paimon: We were right not to let our guard down!

## Talk 8

Paimon: We found you, Cyno— Oh, wait, is that a Swiftfly?
Cyno: Stay put, don't move...
Paimon: Ah, he caught it!
Paimon: Huh? Cyno? What's wrong?
Cyno: This isn't what I'm looking for. It's a—
Kaveh: *huffing*... Finally, I made it. I heard that you caught a Swiftfly, Cyno. Mind letting me see what it looks like?
Kaveh: ...Hold on, isn't this the mechanical bait that I released earlier? Why would you catch that instead of a Swiftfly!?
Faruzan: Wait a minute. If we consider this from a different angle, isn't it a good thing that the bait you made was convincing enough to fool even Cyno?
Traveler: You released...
Kaveh: That's right. During a previous interior design project, I felt that the artificial flowers on the wall were a little bland, so I decided on placing a few moving mechanical butterflies to add some pizazz.
Kaveh: In order to make them both small and nimble, I consulted with Madam Faruzan.
Kaveh: Not long ago, the two of us took all those mechanical butterflies and released them into the city—
Paimon: Why would you do that?
Faruzan: Hmph, need you even ask? Young people these days really do need to get out more.
Faruzan: Have you never played that game where you place strips of paper on a bamboo pole and wave it across a field of flowers to attract a whole kaleidoscope of butterflies?
Cyno: No, I haven't.
Cyno: Wait. So you're trying to...
Faruzan: That's right. The butterflies within the city will mistake our mechanical bait for one of their own and follow them around.
Faruzan: As long as we keep releasing and retrieving our bait, we can capture all the butterflies within the city. What comes afterward is just a matter of separating the Swiftflies from the others!
Paimon: Huh, guess that's one way to do it.
Faruzan: Do not underestimate the wisdom of your elders. I had already thought of this method the moment the round's rules were announced.
Faruzan: Of course, we also owe much to this fine junior of mine here for making such lifelike butterflies. It seems that Kshahrewar has not quite declined as far as I had thought in recent years — their teaching skills, at least, seem to be intact.
Kaveh: Well, I just stuck to what I do best. The idea was yours.
Faruzan: Ah, no need to be so polite. Once we capture all these butterflies, we shall split the points for this round...
Faruzan: Ah, look, one of them is returning now... Hmm? Wait a moment. Are my eyes deceiving me? Why don't I see any butterflies behind it?
Paimon: That's because there are none! Seems like your plan has hit a snag.
Cyno: Looks like the match continues. I'll be looking elsewhere.
Faruzan: Hmm, strange... Has something else diverted their attention?
Faruzan: Come! Let's search in the direction the bait returned from!
Paimon: We'll go have a look, too!
Traveler: ...Bait?

## Talk 9

Paimon: Huh? Faruzan, Kaveh, why did you two stop?
Faruzan: Ah, so it was the Amurta boy...
Paimon: Tighnari!
Tighnari: Fascinating, isn't it? The butterflies have all congregated here, due to a special incense that I used.
Tighnari: I infused it with three different types of honey, and the butterflies, following the fragrance, have gathered around me.
Huwa: Butterflies must have really sharp noses, then!
Huwa: Wait... Do they even have noses? I've never seen one.
Tighnari: They do not, in fact, and their vision isn't stellar, either.
Tighnari: However, they can use their antennae to distinguish between scents, and their olfactory senses are generally quite advanced, allowing them to detect floral fragrances from great distances.
Huwa: Oh, so that's how it is! I had a pet butterfly once. I picked wild flowers and placed them in its box, but it wouldn't eat any...
Tighnari: That's normal. Raising butterflies isn't difficult, but there are many things you should take note of.
Tighnari: Appropriate temperature, sufficient air, and a spacious environment are examples of such considerations. You must also ensure that the food you've chosen suits their "palate."
Tighnari: Most importantly, you must curb your curiosity and avoid disturbing them while they rest, otherwise they may become stressed.
Huwa: Ah, sorry, I liked to poke at its wings at the time...
Tighnari: Humans tend to rear many creatures due to their aesthetic value, but not all are suited for such a process.
Tighnari: Caring for living beings is hard work. Impulse alone is insufficient — some prerequisite knowledge is always required.
Haryadi: You sure do know a lot!
Habib: I—I have a question, too. I bought a scarab not long ago, and it hasn't seemed very active. Can you help me figure out why?
Aymar: I'd like to keep a Dusk Bird as a pet. What are some key points I should consider?
Mahar: Um... Is it possible to keep a Rishboland Tiger as a pet?
Tighnari: Alright, it seems like you all have a great deal of questions.
Tighnari: But I'm in the middle of the Interdarshan Championship at the moment, so I'm afraid I can't answer them all now.
Tighnari: Let me propose an alternative. Next month, there will be a biology lecture at Gandharva Ville, and I will be sharing some interesting insights on living organisms there.
Tighnari: If you're interested, you can attend that lecture, and if you should have any questions, just prepare them ahead of time. I'll answer questions after I've finished speaking.
Huwa: Alright! I'll be there!
Tighnari: Of course, please try to ask more... rational questions. For example, whether you can raise a Rishboland Tiger as a pet or not is mainly dependent on whether you can overcome one in a fight.
Paimon: Looks like Tighnari's science lecture will draw quite a crowd!
Faruzan: Huh? Oh! Ahem, was I listening in for that long?
Faruzan: Seems Collei's master does live up to his title as a teacher...
Kaveh: Madam Faruzan, I've had a look around. Nearly all the butterflies in this area have been attracted by the incense.
Kaveh: However, we can cast our bait further away to avoid this area.
Faruzan: Alright, then let's get moving. We shan't let all the butterflies get away from us if we can help it!
Paimon: Seems like the competition's really heating up. Let's go see how the other contestants are doing!

## Talk 10

Paimon: Layla! How are things going on your end?
Layla: I've been searching for quite a while now, but I haven't seen any sign of the Swiftflies yet.
Layla: Instead, I ended up catching a few mechanical devices that looked very similar to butterflies. I wonder where they came from...
Paimon: Looks like Faruzan and Kaveh's devices are everywhere now...
Layla: I'll keep up the search. That said, I've noticed that the number of butterflies in the city has already decreased a lot compared to when the event started.
Layla: Probably because the other contestants are coming up with their own ways to catch butterflies... Alright, I'll do my best, too. Huh?
Paimon: What's this?
Traveler: Could it be...
Layla: Oh, what a coincidence. I guess I just need to catch it now, right?
Layla: Oh, um, please wait! Ah, there it goes...
Paimon: It's so fast! Paimon thought Alhaitham said they were only a little faster!
Layla: No, come back!
Paimon: #C'mon, Traveler! Let's go, too!
Traveler: A Swiftfly?

## Talk 11

Dehya: Oh, it just occurred to me that we should also get you a makeup box.
Candace: No, it's fine. I don't think I'll end up using it.
Dehya: Maybe you won't, but it doesn't hurt to have one, right?
Dehya: C'mon, just trust me on this one...
Dehya: Huh? Who are you, and what do you want?
Layla: P—Please... don't move...
Dehya: "Don't move"? Who sent you?
Candace: Dehya...
Dehya: Don't worry, I can handle this. Now, tell me, what do you want?
Candace: I believe she's looking for this. Here, take it.
Dehya: A—A butterfly? Was it on my head?
Layla: Oh, you're—
Candace: It's been a while, Layla.
Dehya: A friend of yours? Oh, so she must be the one you were telling me about...
Paimon: Huh? You two know each other?
Layla: Oh, yeah... it has been some time. The first time I ever woke up after sleepwalking, I somehow found myself in Aaru Village. Candace was the one who took care of me then.
Candace: That's right. She didn't look well, so I gave her something to eat. She said a lot of complicated things about astrology, the night sky, the stars... Not sure I understood it all, but it sounded pretty enchanting.
Candace: Right, do you still want this butterfly? It seems like you were chasing it all the way here.
Candace: It's of little use to me, but if you don't want it, I can release it.
Dehya: Just let her have it. It's no big deal.
Paimon: The Swiftfly was flying so fast, but you were able to catch it like it was nothing, Candace.
Candace: It didn't seem that quick, really. I was actually worried that I would injure it, but I'm glad that didn't happen.
Dehya: Anyway, sorry about the butterfly thing. With the way you suddenly came running over like that, I thought you were hired to take us out or something.
Dehya: On second thought, I guess I've never seen an assassin that looks tired with dark bags around their eyes... Oh, you must be taking part in the Championship? Take it from me, don't let it stop you from getting some rest.
Layla: I'll do what I can. Thank you.
Dehya: We'll be on our way, then. See you later.
Paimon: Alrighty. Let's bring the Swiftfly back together with Layla!

## Talk 12

Alhaitham: It seems we have a third contestant who has returned with a Swiftfly.
Alhaitham: With that, the first round has come to an end. I anticipate that all of you will keep up the effort for the second round. Dismissed.
Nilou: Ah, um... Your closing statement sounded so... How do I put it... Decisive?
Alhaitham: Well, you could certainly stand to try being more decisive, Nilou. It would help you live more freely.
Paimon: Hang on a second! Who were the first two contestants with Swiftflies?
Nilou: Tighnari was first, and as for the second... It's being discussed right now.
Traveler: It's being discussed?
Kaveh: Hey, Alhaitham, I think I've come up with a good idea.
Kaveh: Second place gets two points, right? Can't Madam Faruzan and I split the points between us?
Alhaitham: Quite the imagination you have there. I've read the Championship handbook from cover to cover, and I never saw any rule which permits that.
Kaveh: Then we can just add a rule.
Alhaitham: Do you really think I'd do that?
Kaveh: C'mon, you're not going to stand in the way of my victory, are you?
Alhaitham: Well, you're free to send the organizing committee an application outlining your naive proposal. They'll get back to you within three working days.
Kaveh: Three working days? It'll be too late by then!
Alhaitham: Unfortunately for you, even dreaming is gonna cost you.
Paimon: Ah, Paimon gets it now. Kaveh and Faruzan found the second Swiftfly together, but the rules say that only one person can get the points...
Faruzan: Ah well, the rules are the rules. Since you call me "Madam" and politely asked for my help, I shall give you these points.
Nilou: So I'll put the points under Kaveh's name, then?
Kaveh: No. If I take these points, won't that only detract from your contributions, Madam Faruzan?
Kaveh: You might be alright with that, but I cannot do it, not in good conscience.
Faruzan: I don't have any problem with it. There are two more rounds, after all. Losing one isn't a major setback.
Faruzan: But if you insist, I have another method — we can draw lots to see who will receive the points.
Kaveh: L—Lots, huh...
Faruzan: What? Is there something wrong with that idea?
Kaveh: ...No. Let's do it.
Nilou: Alright, I'll get the paper needed for the lots. Give me a moment.
Black Screen Text: Everybody watches Kaveh suffer a glorious and forthright defeat in the game of lots.
Kaveh: Ugh, seriously...
Faruzan: I'm sorry, but it appears that luck was on my side this time.
Kaveh: No, you do deserve it... I'm just lamenting my bad luck. Perhaps... *sigh* Perhaps that's why my life is rife with troubles...
Alhaitham: Indeed, it's rare to see anyone with such terrible luck be so willing to decide victory via lots.
Kaveh: And what would you know about that? I just...
Alhaitham: We can save bickering for later. Record the points under Faruzan, and that'll finally bring the first round to a close.
Alhaitham: The second round will be held in the desert. We'll be moving our commentator's stand over to Aaru Village.
Alhaitham: Let's meet up in Aaru Village once everything is ready. I'll announce the details of the second round then.
Alhaitham: Till then, you have some free time. I'm off the clock at this point, so it's farewell for now.
Kaveh: Wait, Alhaitham! You...! *sigh*
Nilou: Don't be upset, Kaveh. Sighing can carry away your good luck, you know.
Kaveh: Oh, so that's how it works? In that case, I'll take in some deep breaths. Maybe that'll help make up for all the luck I've lost!
Kaveh: *deep breath* It's really no big deal. Two points aren't enough to decide victory or defeat just yet.
Kaveh: I'll win the next round, you'll see!
Faruzan: Looks like you've managed to pick yourself back up, young man. Good. I must warn you, though, that I'm quite familiar with the desert. You'll have to try your best if you don't want to lose.
Kaveh: I'm no stranger to the desert either, I'll be fine. Alright then, that's enough chit-chat for now. I'm going to check the area out.
Paimon: Hmm... So the current standings are Tighnari in first place, Faruzan in second, and Layla in third.
Paimon: Guess we should also take a nice break before the next round starts. But where should we go first?
Morgiana: Why, you two look a little lost. If you're not sure where to start enjoying the Akademiya Extravaganza, then may I suggest that you have a chat with our boss?
Paimon: Your boss? Who's that? Do we know them?
Morgiana: Hehe, well, only the most famous merchant in all of Sumeru — Lord Sangemah Bay!
Paimon: Oh, you mean Dori!
Morgiana: Precisely! Our boss sent me to inform you two that she'll be waiting for you at Sumeru City's north gate.

## Talk 13

Dori: #Oho! Well, if it isn't Traveler and Paimon!
Paimon: Hey, Dori! Are you here to attend the Akademiya Extravaganza too?
Dori: Of course! People are practically flocking to Sumeru City. You couldn't ask for a better opportunity to do business!
Dori: This is one of the entrances into the city, and it's very close to the Wisdom Gala booths. There'll be an endless stream of customers! Hehe, I can already hear the Mora going "clink-clink-clink" as they fill my coin pouch...
Dori: Well, is there anything you'd like to purchase? We've got everything you need and deals that can't be beat!
Paimon: Hmm... Well, do you have anything to eat?
Dori: Wait, we're celebrating the Extravaganza, and you're only thinking of eating— ahem, I mean, of cooourse we've got lots of things to eat! That said, I recommend that you also consider some of the great bargains we have going on.
Dori: The Wisdom Gala is about to begin, and once it starts, each of the Darshans will prepare a small challenge for everyone.
Dori: And, just between us, I have some Super Booster Supplements for sale. Eat just one to boost both your strength and dexterity for a short time, allowing you to overcome any challenge!
Paimon: No thanks, we'll pass. These little challenges are gonna be a cinch for the two of us, just you watch!
Paimon: Anyway, Paimon just wants something to eat, please. If you don't have any food, then we'll go somewhere else.
Dori: Alright, alright, Mora is Mora, after all. What would you like to eat?
Paimon: Hmmm... Well, Paimon's pretty hungry right now. Do you have any tahchin?
Dori: Let me see...
Amur: This is a huge job, isn't it?
Ganjul: If this works out, we'll be set...
Dori: Here you go! Two servings of tahchin! See? I told you there's nothing Lord Sangemah Bay can't procure!
Paimon: #Yay! Uh... Huh? What are you looking at, Traveler?
Traveler: I thought I saw someone just now...
Paimon: Oh? Who? Someone we know?
Traveler: Never mind...
Dori: Was it someone suspicious? Have we attracted some unwanted attention?
Paimon: Huh? What's happening, Dori? Is there something else going on?
Dori: I don't know who you saw just now, but I do have some hard-to-come-by information about the Extravaganza. If you want to know more, we can talk business later.
Traveler: They're gone.

## Talk 14

Faruzan: Do you remember those things we made previously?
Kaveh: Huh? You mean...
Faruzan: It's time for them to shine.
Paimon: It looks like Faruzan and Kaveh have some secret plan!
Kaveh: Oh, hello there! Madam Faruzan and I are discussing how—
Faruzan: Shh, hush now! The walls have ears around here. We should keep it a secret for now, though you'll find out what we have in store soon enough.
Faruzan: Come now, let's go — before the others act!
Kaveh: Alright, there's no time to lose. We're off to make our preparations. See you later!

## Talk 15

Tighnari: Hmm... This is basically what I'll need. Do you think you'll have any difficulties?
Collei: I have most of the reagents with me, and I can buy the rest.
Paimon: Collei, you're here too!
Paimon: Um, Tighnari, you have a master plan ready?
Tighnari: My hypothesis is that the Swiftflies' morphological variations won't significantly affect their fundamental nature. So, I'm planning on using this to lure them out.
Tighnari: Of course, I could be wrong. Every mutation opens the door to new possibilities, especially when they are artificially introduced...
Tighnari: Details will have to wait until after the post-experimental analysis. For now, Collei and I are going to buy some reagents for our experiment. Alright, well, see you later.
Paimon: Okay, see ya!

## Talk 16

Layla: *sigh*
Paimon: Hey, Layla! Hmm? You look a little worried.
Layla: Yeah... I have no idea what I should do. What color are these Swiftflies? Do they have special markings? How do they differ from ordinary butterflies?
Layla: I can't even figure out these basic questions, and most of what I've learned in the past is completely useless here...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Aren't people who research the stars supposed to have some extraordinary abilities? Why not use astrology to solve it?
Layla: Oh, you're another contestant... Hat Guy, was it?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Is it that you can't use astrology during the day? Huh, guess that skill's less useful than I thought.
Layla: No, it's not like that. If it's daytime, all I need is an astrolabe...
Paimon: So why don't you do that, then?
Layla: Mona Megistus the Astrologist said that those who constantly use astrology to obtain things that shouldn't be theirs will eventually lose the "blessing from the stars."
Layla: Um, it's just something I read in an academic publication. I really love to read Mona's essays...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: You're overthinking it. Power is just a tool. It just seems to me that you don't have the resolve to win this. Well, suit yourself. Wallow in your immature ideals if you like.
Paimon: Hey! Seriously? Just walking off after saying a bunch of mean stuff like that?
Layla: Um, did I say something wrong just now?
Traveler: No, it's good to have your own convictions.
Layla: Thank you so much. I've made up my mind not to use astrology for this. I think I'll just try my luck in the city.
Layla: To be honest, I've always been pretty good at observation, and if I'm fortunate, I might be able to find that special butterfly species...
Bahir: Lord Cyno seems to have found a Swiftfly! Come on, let's go check it out!
Alae: Really? Where?
Bahir: The butterfly flew up high, and he's chasing it now!
Alae: Oh, no time to lose! Let's go see!
Layla: As expected of Cyno... Ah, actually, shouldn't you two go have a look as well? The moment when he catches the butterfly will likely be one worth recording, after all.
Layla: I'll head into the city shortly to start my own search. I'll see you later.
Paimon: Alright. In that case, let's go see Cyno first, and then we can check on what everyone else is up to!
Traveler: It was just a difference in perspectives, that's all.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Tighnari: Hmm, the scent is starting to fade.
Tighnari: Seems the wind is stronger than I thought. The incense isn't going to last long...

### Additional Talk 2

Cyno: How could it not be real...

### Additional Talk 3

#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: What brings you two here?
Paimon: Huh? You're here having coffee? Aren't you supposed to be a contestant?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Is there really any need for me to take part while everyone's running around like it's some sort of carnival? Don't worry, I'll get involved once things actually get serious.

### Additional Talk 4

Faruzan: Let's wait here. Whew, seems my age is catching up with me.

### Additional Talk 5

Kaveh: Please lead the Swiftflies back here... I'm really counting on you.

### Additional Talk 6

Paimon: Kaveh, Faruzan, Layla!
Kaveh: Huh? Oh, it's you. Why're you here?
Paimon: We're here as specially invited guest commentators! Our job is to record what happens during the competition!
Faruzan: Is that so? In that case, I'll have to trouble you to catch the moment of my triumph on Kamera!
Faruzan: Remember to shoot from behind at a lower angle — you know, to capture a senior's class!
Kaveh: Don't get ahead of yourself, now. Victory will obviously be mine!
Faruzan: Hah, you're far too young to even consider challenging me. Kshahrewar or Rtawahist, you're all children as far as I'm concerned...
Layla: A—Actually, I was going to ask... How do you know me, Madam Faruzan?
Faruzan: Hmm? You don't remember? I sometimes see you in the library at night. You even waved at me!
Layla: What...? I don't remember doing that at all!
Faruzan: How strange... However, this is not the time for curiosity. I am Faruzan, a household name in Haravatat. You are Layla from Rtawahist, I presume?
Layla: Y—Yes.
Faruzan: Good, then we are officially introduced. See? Simple as that.
Faruzan: I like respectful ones, by the way. Would you like to join my research group?
Kaveh: Madam Faruzan... I'm quite sure this counts as poaching. Let's dial things down...
Faruzan: I know, but it's been tough getting people these days, and research funding has been hard to secure...
Faruzan: But once I win this tournament, it'll be a different story...
Paimon: So you're just here to increase the amount of funding you're getting?
Faruzan: Well, not just that... What, are you curious about my reasons for participating in this event?
Faruzan: Well, I suppose that's to be expected. You are our guest commentators, after all.
Faruzan: There's been an influx of newly enrolled students, and they'll be paying close attention to this competition. If I do win, I'm certain that there will be no lack of students knocking upon my door.
Faruzan: Moreover, research resources will be made available to the victor, so that will nix my funding issues. Therefore, my two juniors, I do apologize, but I fully intend to emerge triumphant.
Layla: I—I'll do my best as well. At least, I don't plan to lose too badly...
Paimon: So why are you here, Layla?
Layla: I don't know why, but a lot of people recommended me. I didn't sign up myself. I just woke up to find my name on the announcement board.
Paimon: That sounds like what happened to Tighnari!
Layla: Him too?
Layla: I'm... I'm really nervous. I've been so worried about disappointing everyone that I've been losing sleep...
Faruzan: Stress not, young one. We must all experience failure to grow and mature.
Layla: But Madam Faruzan, I don't want to fail...
Kaveh: Tch, seriously? Everyone has such nice reasons for joining.
Traveler: And what's your story, Kaveh?
Kaveh: Must I say?
Paimon: Yes, you do! We gotta record it!
Kaveh: Um, well... You know, right? I want to buy some property...
Paimon: Ooh, that's right! You want to move out of Alhaitham's—
Kaveh: *coughing* What!? Alhaitham? What about him!? This has nothing to do with him!
Traveler: Paimon's misremembering things.
Paimon: Oh...! Right! Sorry, Paimon has no idea what she was talking about...
Paimon: So, you want to use the grand prize to buy a place, right?
Kaveh: Correct. Also, my father took part in the Interdarshan Championship when I was young, but he didn't win.
Kaveh: Once I do, the right to wear that diadem will be mine. In a way, I'll be helping my father fulfill a dream of his.
Faruzan: That's not a bad reason at all. You have ambition, youngster.
Faruzan: Although your chances with me here aren't great, I believe your father would be most proud if the Diadem of Knowledge were bestowed upon you.
Kaveh: ...Not that he'll have the chance to celebrate. My father passed away many years ago. They say he ran into quicksand while traveling in the desert.
Faruzan: For you to have experienced such a thing... That must have been tough for you.
Kaveh: ...
Kaveh: It's all in the past now, and life goes on, doesn't it? Let's change topics — I don't want to bring the mood down.
Faruzan: Alright. Earlier, you said that you want to use the prize Mora to purchase a home. Where do you live now, do you live alone?
Kaveh: *cough* Well...
Faruzan: Hmm... I also heard you mention "Alhaitham" just a moment ago. Isn't he also from Haravatat? Are you two hiding something from me?
Kaveh: No, of course not! Why would you think that? Hahaha...
Paimon: Paimon's definitely not involved, either! We're gonna go interview other contestants now! Bye!

### Additional Talk 7

Wiqas: Is there anything else I can help you with?

### Additional Talk 8

Alae: It's been a long time since the last Interdarshan Championship. How exciting!

### Additional Talk 9

Aissa: They say that Sachin was a Vahumana researcher and that he was a pretty famous genius. I guess geniuses always appreciate the knowledge of other geniuses, haha!

### Additional Talk 10

Cyno: I'm surprised you were willing to come to Sumeru City at all.
Tighnari: Well, the atmosphere at the Akademiya has improved immensely since Azar and his ilk were deposed. Master has been busy recently, so he hasn't had the time to instruct me or try to convince me to return to the Akademiya.
Tighnari: So I've been occasionally visiting the city these days. Trade and business are in greater abundance here, so it's much easier to acquire necessary research equipment.

### Additional Talk 11

Layla: You know, I was just thinking... How did the two of you meet?
Kaveh: I was wrestling with a particularly tricky problem, and she happened to pass by while I was puzzling over it at the House of Daena. She then proceeded to provide some comments.
Faruzan: "Provide some comments"? I was bestowing instruction!
Faruzan: Hmph. In truth, I have no intention of solving Kshahrewar's problems for them, but I decided that this youngster seemed to have a decent attitude, and so we had a good chat.
Faruzan: But ultimately, I am a Haravatat scholar, so please come to me with questions about linguistics next time.

### Additional Talk 12

#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Enjoy the Interdarshan Championship. This will be one to remember, I'm sure.

### Additional Talk 13

Kareena: The other contestants are all wearing tracking devices, so you can use your locator to find them more easily.

### Additional Talk 14

Nilou: This is my first time commentating for such a competition. I'm feeling kinda nervous.
Paimon: Nilou, how did you get picked to be a guest commentator?
Nilou: The staff said that spectators would be less inclined to come if the contestants and commentators were all from the Akademiya.
Nilou: I don't quite understand it, but I'm happy that we're able to all meet again.

### Additional Talk 15

Alhaitham: I didn't expect that you would be invited as well.
Paimon: Neither did we! Uh... by the way, how did you get picked, Alhaitham?
Alhaitham: There were several factors, but primarily the recommendation of the sages. I suppose they assumed that I'd have the free time for this job after resigning as Acting Grand Sage.
Alhaitham: That said, they'd probably claim that my calm demeanor would help maintain fairness in the competition.
Paimon: Sounds like you've got a lot on your plate...
Alhaitham: Not really. The job itself is quite simple and effortless.

### Additional Talk 16

#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Let me find a good place to...

### Additional Talk 17

Kaveh: Are you sure it's alright to release so many?
Faruzan: Have some faith, it'll be fine.

### Additional Talk 18

Tighnari: Good, we've got all our ingredients. Next, could I trouble you to help me mix them together?
Collei: Of course, Master!

### Additional Talk 19

Layla: I'm going to try my luck in the city, too.

### Additional Talk 20

Cyno: Not here...

### Additional Talk 21

Layla: Wonder if I'll find one here.

### Additional Talk 22

Cyno: This is taking longer than I thought.

### Additional Talk 23

Dehya: Whew... what a crowd. Seems the Akademiya Extravaganza is in full swing. What do you wanna get?
Candace: Hmm... Maybe we can buy some gifts to bring back?
Dehya: Now? Huh... I usually get gifts last. Let's go walk around somewhere else first...

### Additional Talk 24

Dehya: These all look great, but they're more expensive than I expected.
Candace: Goods are more expensive here than in Aaru Village.
Dehya: ...Ah to heck with it! How often do you get to come to the city? Let's not get hung up over the prices!
Candace: Dehya, are you sure you want to buy this for me? ...Ooh, this is a heavier material than I expected. Thank you.
Dehya: Don't worry about it! It's just nice to go clothes shopping together.

### Additional Talk 27

Alhaitham: I will now announce the rules for the first round of the competition. Please listen carefully!
Alhaitham: During the opening ceremony, Akademiya staff released several cages of butterflies, and many of them are now fluttering within Sumeru City.
Alhaitham: Amongst these butterflies, three of them will be special Swiftflies. They have a different appearance and also fly a little faster.
Alhaitham: Your objective this round is to find a Swiftfly and bring it to me. Three points will be awarded to the first participant to return, two to the second, and one point to the third.
Alhaitham: That is all for the first round. Should you require clarification on anything, please ask any of the other staff.
Paimon: Alhaitham's all business all the time, huh?
Paimon: Hmm. That said, how did he get picked to be a commentator? Paimon's kinda curious...
Layla: Finding three specific butterflies in a place as large as Sumeru City sounds rather improbable...
Tighnari: If these Swiftflies behave anything like regular butterflies...
Cyno: I'm off. It will take some time to search every corner of Sumeru City.
Kaveh: Huh? You're going, just like that?
Cyno: A champion walks the road to victory!
Faruzan: My dear Kshahrewar junior, I have a plan. How about some cooperation between you and me?
Kaveh: Cooperation?
Paimon: Looks like everyone's got their own plans for this toughie.
Paimon: We're supposed to go on stage next, right? Uh, let's wait and see everyone's reactions first.
Paimon: Huh? Wait a minute, look! He seems to be observing the other contestants, just like we are!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...Hmph.
Paimon: We were right not to let our guard down!
