## Talk

Paimon: We found a piece of paper with a bunch of names on it! Maybe it's a record of something?
Dehya: Lemme take a look. If this really is a merchant caravan, they should have a record of their transactions.
Dehya: Hmm... Yep, I see an entry for Dakan Al-Ahmar right here. Kusayla, Idrisi, Bashar, and Tikriti...
Dehya: All familiar names. Dakan Al-Ahmar has been trading for a hefty supply of food, weapons, and medicine. It seems that in the past, they used to receive some Canned Knowledge as well.
Dehya: This caravan is just one link in their logistics chain. Once in the rainforest, the caravan will exchange the looted goods for Mora, and the funds will then be passed to a specific person.
Dehya: That person will then pack the caravan full of necessary goods, which will then be brought right back to Dakan Al-Ahmar...
Dehya: ...Wait. Why is there no Mora value recorded for the final transaction?
Paimon: Hmm? No value?
Dehya: Yeah. Every transaction before the last one was marked with an exact amount of Mora. But the final one, where they paid for everything to be brought back to the desert... was simply marked as "delivered."
Traveler: Maybe the Mora amounts just happened to cancel each other out?
Dehya: Hmm, perhaps, but they couldn't have known how much they would make off selling the loot. Do they not care about profit margins at all?
Dehya: Anyway, the next part's the records of the goods themselves. There are a lot of entries... everything was probably sourced from the rainforest.
Dehya: Huh!?
Paimon: What's wrong?
Dehya: Shahzaman Homayani...
Paimon: Homayani!? You mean Dunyarzad's family?
Paimon: Uhh, c—could it just be another family with the same last name?
Dehya: I'd be surprised to find someone with the exact same first and last name. Shahzaman Homayani is Dunyarzad's father, and the head of the Homayani family.
Dehya: Just what the heck is going on here...
Traveler: Calm down, Dehya.
Dehya: I'm sorry... You're right. I'll consider what we've found, and not jump to conclusions just yet.
Dehya: But what this piece of paper confirms is that the Homayani family has been providing goods to Dakan Al-Ahmar.
Paimon: What if the Homayanis have been kept in the dark, and don't know they've been trading with Dakan Al-Ahmar?
Dehya: That's a possibility, but if that was the case, why has this caravan specifically named Shahzaman as their person of contact?
Dehya: They could have just as easily bought goods such as food and medicine directly from Caravan Ribat or Port Ormos.
Traveler: If Shahzaman was actually aware of this...
Dehya: Yeah... Funding violence and looting. The brigade gets the goods, and he is paid the proceeds from the sale of the loot.
Paimon: B—But why would he do something like this? It's not like the Homayanis are in need of money...
Dehya: I honestly have no idea...
Dehya: I've been to their estate many times, and I've never noticed anything suspicious.
Dehya: The only potentially large expenditure I can think of would be the treatment costs for Dunyarzad's Eleazar. Maybe they borrowed a lot of Mora in the past?
Dehya: But that's still just a speculation. I don't think the master would stoop so low to make Mora.
Traveler: I don't think Dunyarzad knows anything about this, either.
Dehya: You're probably right. I know my lady's personality, and she wouldn't deliberately keep something like this from us.
Paimon: But what should we do now? All we've found is just another mystery...
Traveler: If we want to get to the bottom of this, we won't be able to turn back.
Dehya: Hmm...
Dehya: If you ask me, we already have no choice but to confront her about this.
Dehya: I'm not worried, it's too early to make a verdict yet. I still have faith in the Homayanis.
Dehya: Let's go find my lady again. We'll tell her everything, and see if she's willing to lend us her support.
Dehya: If we're lucky, we can not only figure out the mystery of this paper, but also follow the trail of breadcrumbs to the people responsible at Dakan Al-Ahmar.
Paimon: Uhh... Dehya, are you sure this is the best decision? What if instead of getting the help we need, we just end up revealing everything we've discovered to the enemy?
Dehya: I've considered that possibility, but even still, I want to tell her what we've found. I think I owe her that much... True friendship is built on trust.
Dehya: She showed genuine concern for me when we first brought up the topic. I can't repay her kindness with doubt and suspicion.
Dehya: That's not how I deal with people.
Paimon: You're right. Paimon wants to trust Dunyarzad. too!
Traveler: I hope we'll be of help to her.
Dehya: Yeah. Let's pay another visit to Sumeru City.
Traveler: Then perhaps he's been supplying the brigade's operations this entire time.
Traveler: Let's analyze the situation first.
