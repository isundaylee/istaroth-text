# Talk Dialog

Sorush: You there, Leaf Hat. I have a question.
Arasaka: Arasaka... Leaf Hat?
Sorush: The Pari find it challenging enough to protect the Vourukasha Oasis. How have you managed to protect a domain as vast as the rainforest for hundreds of years?
Arasaka: You are not a Nara... You are a bird! Red and warm and small! Arasaka can make you something to eat!
Sorush: A... bird? No, I am a Pari. We live in the Vourukasha Oasis.
Arasaka: The Vourukasha Oasis? Like Vanarana... but for a bird?
Sorush: Vana... rana? Something tells me this conversation is going nowhere...
Arasaka: Little red bird is a good bird! Good birds can come to Vanarana. Arasaka will make you delicious food.
Arasaka: We can practice Ararakalari together, and find lots and lots of "tracer"!
Sorush: Ah... well... okay...
Sorush: (Have I been stuck at the Oasis for too long? It's like I can't understand the language of the outside world anymore... Whatever he said sounded impressive, though.)
