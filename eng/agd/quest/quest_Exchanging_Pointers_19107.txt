## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Elzer: Oh, are you... done? I'm very, uh... excited to taste your new work.
Connor: I wonder what kind of... surprise will be in store for us.

### Additional Talk 2

Connor: Uh, but... is it even...
Elzer: Connor, the most important thing right now is to show Diona our sincerity, understand?
Connor: Ah, understood!

### Additional Talk 3

Elzer: Great job, keep it up. We'll definitely be able to hire Diona as resident bartender here!
Connor: I hope it works. I was out there for weeks waiting for this chance... We mustn't let this opportunity go to waste.
Elzer: You really outdid yourself this time, Connor. As long as we can get Diona to come work here, all our hard work will have paid off. This is just the first step.
Elzer: Now don't forget, Diona must feel our sincerity and our passion! Oh, and remember, try not to overdo it...
Connor: No problem. We've already gone over this many times before.
Traveler: What are you guys talking about?
Elzer: Huh?! Oh, hehe... nothing. We're just uhh... just discussing some winery business matters, yeah... hahaha.
Connor: Yâ€”Yeah, we're talking about business. Let's go over the recent upkeep costs of the winery again, shall we, Elzer?

### Additional Talk 4

Diona: Remember, do everything completely opposite to how Connor did. This is the only way we can reach my... I mean, our goal.
