# Missing title (3894177799)

Zhongli: The vegetables are fresh, and there are enough wheats and grains stocked up... I'll pass on the seafood.
Zhongli: Oh, it's you. We meet again.
Zhongli: Surprised to see me here?
Zhongli: It's the director's orders. Xiangling worked all day and night at the restaurant during the festival and didn't get to have any time to enjoy the festivities. The director sent me here to help out in the kitchen so that Xiangling will have some time to herself.
Zhongli: But with someone as hardworking as you around, there seems to be nothing much for me to do...
Guoba: â™ª~
Zhongli: It feels good seeing my old friend in the kitchen fetching ingredients and lighting fires.
Zhongli: Perhaps I should borrow Cloud Retainer's supreme cuisine machine to speed things up...
Guoba: !
Zhongli: ...You'd still prefer to make them by hand? But of course.
