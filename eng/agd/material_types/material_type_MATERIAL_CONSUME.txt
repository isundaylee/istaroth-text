## Dust of Azoth

A device that can transmute elemental Ascension Materials and change their Elemental Type.
Its practical uses notwithstanding, alchemy is the study of the nature of matter and the rules that underpin its transformations, and ultimately it seeks to comprehend the working principles of the world and the flow of the ley lines.
It is not known who would share alchemical achievements of this magnitude with the civilizations of the world and why. But although the power to fundamentally transmute elemental energy in its crystallized and inert form is a highly useful one, this device also conceals the grave danger of disrupting the elemental balance...

## Sanctifying Elixir

A material that is consumed when defining Artifacts with the Artifact Transmuter.
Artifacts are themselves the crystallized physical manifestation of ideals and memories. This is one of the applications of the noble art of Alchemy — namely, to preserve ideals by crystallizing them inside the essence of material objects. Only in this way can they be molded according to need.

## Dust of Enlightenment

The power of Artifacts stems from stories. Thus, sacred or profane writings may reshape them.
There is no good or evil inherent in stories, while songs and words have the power to save as well as destroy — such was the belief of the emissary who once conveyed revelations on the holiest one's behalf, governing the nations on earth and their glory, and who eventually fell from the high heavens. To this day, whether pure or impure, these feathers can still inscribe false revelations and rewrite fated tales, yet the only outcome of defying the world is to scatter into dust.

Indeed, blows traded with the strong are stepping stones towards becoming stronger yourself.
