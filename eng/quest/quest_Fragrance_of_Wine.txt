# Fragrance of Wine


## Talk 1

Kaeya: Winery rules state that whoever picks the most grapes without damaging them gets to drink the first glass from the new batch.

## Talk 2

Diluc: Where's Kaeya? Gone already?
Traveler: Kaeya's still here. What're you working on?
Diluc: Right now, just the usual day-to-day winery business. But I'll be attending a meeting in Elzer's place shortly.
Diluc: The meeting concerns research and development of new beverages, and involves collaboration between several different wineries. It makes more sense for me to attend, anyway.
Diluc: Kaeya can answer any questions you might have while I'm not here. He's quite familiar with the winery.

## Talk 3
