# The City of Rains and Remembrance


## Talk 1

Lyney: This is our current abode.
Lyney: Ah, Freminet, you're home. Where did everyone else go? I have some new friends that I would like to introduce.
Freminet: Oh, they all just went out a moment ago.
Lyney: I see. Everyone is getting busier now that "Father" will be returning soon. I suppose that can't be helped...
Lyney: Allow me to introduce you to my little brother, Freminet. He is a phenomenal diver.
Freminet: Uh, hello...
Paimon: #Nice to meet you! Paimon is Paimon, and this is {NICKNAME}. You sound very proud to have a diver as a brother, Lyney.
Traveler: Lyney sure seems to have a big family.
Lyney: Haha...
Freminet: Uh, Lyney... Could you come here for a moment?
Lyney: Hmm? What is it, Freminet? Do you have something to tell me?
Traveler: It's alright, you go ahead.
Lyney: Hmm... Okay, I see.
Paimon: Is everything alright?
Lyney: Oh, it's nothing, we were just discussing a little housework. Sorry for the interruption.
Lyney: #Before I forget, {NICKNAME} and I collected more materials to make Magic Pockets. Were you able to get any, Freminet?
Freminet: Yes, I went diving and gathered lots of materials. I was about to give them to you.
Lyney: That's our Freminet, always quick with the underwater work. Alright, I'll take these to the workshop.
Lynette: Looks like... rain.
Paimon: Oh, you're right. But wasn't it clear and sunny just a moment ago? Hmm... Fontaine's weather sure is weird.
Lyney: Hehe, I'm afraid that's just how it is here. It often rains on days when there are trials being held in the opera house, but don't worry, it'll clear up soon enough.
Freminet: ...
Paimon: Hmm? What's wrong, Freminet?
Freminet: There's a legend about the rain that I tend to believe...
Freminet: It's said that a Dragon of Water once resided in Fontaine. Though we don't know where the dragon went, every time it weeps, the skies will cloud up and pour out rain.
Freminet: When I was a child, my mother told me that if I wanted to go outside and play, I should yell toward the sky at the top of my lungs...
Freminet: "Hydro Dragon, Hydro Dragon, don't cry!"
Traveler: Could that Hydro Dragon be the elemental dragon of Fontaine?
Paimon: If it's an elemental dragon, then having the power to make it rain wouldn't be very unusual.
Paimon: Let Paimon try something...
Paimon: "Hydro Dragon, Hydro Dragon, don't cry!"
Paimon: ...
Lyney: Heh... doesn't seem to be of any use. It is just a legend, after all.
Lynette: You know, you might be a more popular magician if you understood the concept of "romanticism"... or could at least play along.
Lyney: Sorry! It might be because we've never met the Hydro Dragon. Perhaps it can't be comforted by the words of strangers.
Black Screen Text: After some time, the rain stops.
Lyney: It rained for longer than I suspected... Uh, it's already getting late.
Paimon: Was there something you needed to do, Lyney?
Lyney: Yeah, some preparations for the show at the opera house. I need to find a way to catch the last aquabus of the day.
Lyney: On the day of the performance, just ride the aquabus to the island of Erinnyes. I'll have Lynette meet you at the fountain in front of the opera house.
Traveler: Sounds good. You go ahead, Lyney.
Freminet: Oh, uh... Are you leaving now?
Lyney: What is it, Freminet? I'm in a hurry. Oh, I get it. You feel nervous delivering the materials for the Magic Pockets, is that it?
Lyney: #Perhaps we could trouble {NICKNAME} to help us take these materials to the Beaumont Workshop and deliver them to the owner there?
Lyney: I'm afraid that Freminet can be quite introverted... And the boss there tends to be pretty talkative. Freminet has always been a little afraid of her.
Paimon: No trouble at all. Don't worry, we're on the case!
Freminet: Sorry for the inconvenience. I'm quite useless when it comes to such tasks... I'll think of a way to make it up to you.
Paimon: Oh, no need, no need! This'll be a walk in the park for us.
Traveler: See you at the performance.
Traveler: Another one of the elemental dragons of Teyvat...
Traveler: What a talented family.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hello? Is there anyone here?
Estelle: Oh, hello there. New customers? Looking to buy, or do you need something made? Or perhaps you're just looking for a chat with me?
Paimon: Oh — no, we're just here to deliver some materials. Here they are. They're for making... uh, what were they called again?
Estelle: Ah, these must be for Magic Pockets. I could tell right away, I've already made several orders' worth now.
Traveler: Do we need to pay?
Estelle: No, no need. They've already prepaid several batches worth. When they told me what they'd be using them for, I even offered them a discount.
Estelle: But they insisted on paying the full amount, saying that I had a business to run... Hehe, it seems both their hearts and their pockets are made of gold.
Paimon: Whoa, so is Lyney actually loaded?
Estelle: I can't say for sure, but who knows... Maybe there's good money to be made being a magician in Fontaine.
Paimon: Hey, is this machine what you use to make stuff here? It looks really advanced...
Estelle: Why use your hands when a machine can do the work? It would be a waste not to use the latest technology, and wasting is a kind of crime.
Paimon: But where does a big machine like that get its power from?
Estelle: Ah, well... It's a little complicated, I'm not sure I can put it in layman's terms for you...
Estelle: But basically, everything we usually use here in the city is powered by Indemnitium. It's a type of energy that's produced from trials.
Paimon: Huh? How can trials produce energy?
Estelle: Well, I'm not completely sure of all the details myself, but basically...
Estelle: When a trial is in session, the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale harvests people's belief in justice, and converts it into energy to be used all around Fontaine.
Paimon: So that's what its other function is? Paimon heard that the Oratrice was created by the Archon to make judgments.
Paimon: But Paimon still doesn't get it. How could something unreliable like people's beliefs be turned into a stable power source for these machines?
Traveler: Well, Venti and Nahida both said...
Paimon: Oh, yeah! So that means the Hydro Archon relies on the machine to take the energy created by belief and turn it into power for all of Fontaine, right?
Estelle: Even though I've never heard anyone really put it that way before, it sounds like it makes sense.
Estelle: Besides Indemnitium, we have another type of energy called "Pneumousia."
Estelle: It isn't produced by the power of the Archon, but it is unstable by nature. Even now it still cannot be widely used by civilians.
Truand: Heh, I thought I'd find you hard at work, but here you are chatting the day away... Since you're already talking, I'm sure you wouldn't mind a few words with me.
Estelle: Y—You again? Didn't I already promise you that I'd have the Mora I owe to Confrerie of Cabriere by next month? Why are you hounding me now?
Truand: Yeah, but how do we know that you won't go running off by the end of this month? I want fifty percent. Today. Wait, no... seventy percent.
Estelle: Huh!? You...
Paimon: Seems business isn't so great for the workshop... We've already finished our job and delivered the materials. Maybe now's a good time to leave?
Traveler: You're right.
Childe: Hey, hold on! Before you go around trying to collect payments, why don't you settle your own debts first?
Childe: If Confrerie of Cabriere wants to poach clients from Northland Bank, that's fine, but I'm afraid you still owe the bank a hefty sum of Mora. So why don't we work things out between us first before you get back to your little conversation here?
Truand: Ah, you're from Northland Bank? But we said we'll pay everything we owe next month. Why are you hounding me now?
Childe: #Oh, {NICKNAME}! Paimon! I didn't think I'd run into you here in Fontaine. What are the chances!?
Paimon: We're surprised to see you too! What are you doing here in Fontaine? You didn't want to stay in Snezhnaya?
Traveler: We sure seem to have run into a lot of friends today.
Childe: Haha! Long story short, I've already been in Fontaine for some time now, and honestly, things have been pretty boring.
Childe: But it seems that fate brought our paths together today. Not only will I have some good friends here now, but ones who always seem to find trouble.
Childe: Either way you look at it, it seems things are going to get a lot more interesting now.
Paimon: #Pretty sure we'd want to avoid anything that you'd find interesting... Besides, our trip here has gone pretty well so far, right {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: I think we've already weathered enough storms for now.
Truand: Ahem, uh... Hey you, Northland Bank boy. Aren't you forgetting something?
Childe: #Don't interrupt. It's not often I run into {NICKNAME} like this. Why don't you wait for me over there for a while?
Truand: You kidding? Aren't you the one looking for us? You really expect us to sit and twiddle our thumbs while you catch up with your friends?
Truand: Listen to me, boy. If you want your Mora, fine — why don't you come and take it?
Childe: #Hey, I just said not to interrupt. Oh, by the way, {NICKNAME}... The last time I took Tonia and Teucer ice fishing, Teucer said...
Truand: HEY!!! That's way over the line! Alright, boys! Let's see who has to pay up now!
Childe: Ugh, can't you at least let me finish one sentence? Fine, though the bank told me not to get rough with our clients...
Childe: You're the ones who started it! This is an act of self-defense. You two will have to be my witnesses, okay?
Traveler: Okay, sure.
Paimon: Paimon's sure this won't take long.
Traveler: Go ahead, they're all yours.
Traveler: I don't mind a little excitement every now and then.
Traveler: Fontaine really is a curious place.
Traveler: Sounds like a usual case of someone owing somebody else money.
Traveler: The gods rely on belief to obtain power.

## Talk 3

Truand: What's your deal, brat...? How are you so strong if you're just a staffer from Snezhnaya's Northland Bank? ...Wait, don't tell me you're—!
Childe: Oh, now you notice? It's a little late, don't you think? Just make sure you understand that you don't mess with Northland Bank, got it?
Childe: ...Huh?
Truand: Now's my chance!
Childe: Huh... That was weird...
Traveler: What just happened?
Childe: I'm not sure... It's as if I suddenly lost control of my Hydro powers when I needed them. Maybe there's something wrong with my Vision?
Paimon: Strange, how could that happen? First time Paimon's ever heard of someone losing control of their Vision.
Childe: Never mind, it doesn't matter. If I wanna stay sharp, I shouldn't be relying too much on my Vision anyway. Besides, I always have my Delusion in case I need it.
Traveler: You'd better not use your Delusion too often.
Paimon: So what are you doing in Fontaine, Childe? And don't say it's work for Northland Bank!
Childe: Well... I guess it's because I've been in a bad mood lately.
Paimon: Huh? What kind of reason is that? Wait, since when do you feel down about anything?
Childe: Haha, I dunno... Maybe I still have a lot to learn about myself.
Childe: But recently, there seems to be some sort of restless power stirring inside of me... And I don't know why, but every now and then I feel like I'm in a terrible mood...
Paimon: Maybe you losing control of your Vision just now is connected with that power you're feeling inside?
Childe: Hmm, that is a possibility.
Traveler: So about this power...
Childe: I can't remember if I've ever mentioned it before, but when I was fourteen, I fell into some unknown abyss...
Childe: It was during that time I learned nearly all of my abilities. The one who took me under her wing and taught me was named Skirk.
Childe: She was always quiet and very mysterious. Nobody knew where she came from or what she had been through, and she was always very strict when teaching me combat techniques.
Childe: One time, I asked her why she was willing to take me on as an apprentice. From what I could make of her answer, it was...
Childe: Because I had awakened "it," and traces of "it" remained on me. She said that all my combat training would be useful in the future.
Paimon: But what is "it"? What did you awaken?
Childe: She never explained that, but my guess is that it's related to a dream I saw when I had just fallen into that abyss.
Childe: In my dream, I was in the deepest depths of the sea, and the boundless seabed was all around me. But in front of me appeared a whale that was so massive I felt like I couldn't breathe.
Paimon: A whale? Oh, that sounds familiar... When we fought against you before, you summoned a huge whale that seemed to leap at us! Is that the one?
Childe: Hehe, that's just an abstract form of a whale that I create using my elemental powers.
Childe: It takes that shape because the scene I dreamt of the whale has always been stuck in my mind. I'll never forget it...
Paimon: So you used the whale as inspiration for one of your moves? Huh... Seems a little twisted to Paimon.
Traveler: It's very possible that...
Paimon: So why don't you just go ask your master? Maybe she knows the answer.
Childe: You make it sound so easy. Ever since the incident I experienced there, I've never stopped searching for Master Skirk and that unknown abyss.
Childe: But it's been years now and I've still found nothing. There isn't even a trace of the place where I remember falling into the abyss.
Paimon: Ooh, it sounds like some kind of ghost story.
Childe: Yeah, I'm out of leads at this point, but there's nothing more I can do. It seems that strange encounters in this world tend to be elusive like that.
Childe: Oh, seems the time really flies when I'm talking with you... I just remembered I have somewhere else I need to be, so I should get going.
Paimon: What, more work for the Northland Bank?
Childe: No, it's more of a personal appointment. Lately, I've been sparring with some of Fontaine's official Champion Duelists whenever I'm feeling bored.
Paimon: Official Champion Duelists? You mean it's their job to duel?
Childe: Yep. In Fontaine, before a criminal goes to court, they're given one chance to defend their honor by requesting a duel with an official Champion Duelist.
Childe: The Champion Duelists are all powerful fighters selected from among the nation's best, and the duel itself is a no holds barred fight with no specified stopping point...
Childe: So engaging in such a duel is regarded as a symbol of defending your honor. If a criminal manages to win the duel, they'll be acquitted, but if they lose, they'll have no choice but to stand trial.
Childe: And the worst case scenario is that you're simply killed in the duel.
Childe: Though it's rumored that Fontaine has a death penalty, from what I can tell, no one has ever been officially sentenced to death.
Childe: So really, the only people who opt to duel are those who have suffered a grave injustice in being accused, or those who greatly value their honor. Otherwise, why gamble with your life?
Paimon: So do many people actually get out of their trials by winning the duel?
Childe: Apparently it's exceedingly rare for anyone to actually win. Fontaine probably enacted this system as a way to show that the nation respects the honor of its citizens.
Childe: Besides, none of the Champion Duelists are to be trifled with... Which is exactly why I was itching to face them as soon as I got to Fontaine.
Childe: Apparently the one I'm meeting today, Clorinde, is the strongest of the Champion Duelists. I had been asking her for some time before she finally agreed to face me today.
Paimon: Well, that's Childe for ya... Paimon feels like we've heard that name somewhere before. Clorinde, huh...
Traveler: When we met the Hydro Archon.
Childe: Oh, before I forget, I want you to have this.
Paimon: Huh? Your Vision! You're seriously just giving it away!?
Childe: I'm just worried that it could become uncontrollable again. I'd be pretty upset if it got in the way of my duel, so I think I'll be better off without it for now.
Childe: Besides, I just need you to hold onto it for a short while. I'll come retrieve it when I have some time later.
Paimon: Paimon knows what you're up to! You just want an excuse to come talk to us again, don't you?
Childe: Haha, whatever gave you that idea? I'll be in touch, later.
Paimon: Huh, that sneaky guy... He said he's been feeling down lately, but he seemed the same as ever to Paimon.
Paimon: Well, seems we don't have much to do for now... We might as well walk around and see the city before Lyney's performance!
Traveler: I'm terrible at remembering names.
Traveler: The power inside you is connected to your incident in the abyss.
Traveler: Do you have any idea where it came from?
Traveler: I don't have a Vision, so don't ask me.
Traveler: Are you feeling alright?

## Talk 4

Paimon: Wow, who could have seen that coming!? The reporter who was barely around for most of the story was the murderer all along!
Traveler: Hey, don't blurt it out, Paimon...
Paimon: Ah, sorry... Paimon was just surprised, that's all. Whew, Paimon never saw that twist coming... The murder mystery novels here are amazing!
Traveler: Never thought I'd see the day when Paimon would enjoy reading...
Paimon: The whodunits here in Fontaine are a lot different than the light novels you see from Yae Publishing House. Both have their merits, but Paimon thinks this style of novels are more... well, novel!
Paimon: It's so exciting to reach the moment when the mystery is uncovered! Especially in the one Paimon was just reading, you should buy a copy and read it, too!
Traveler: I'm good.
Paimon: Oh, sorry about that... Paimon will be more careful next time.
Paimon: Hey, shouldn't we be heading to the opera house to see Lyney's performance soon? It's almost time for the show to start, so we should get going.
Traveler: You already spoiled who the murderer is.
Traveler: Do you have any idea how long we were loitering here...
Traveler: It's rude to spoil the mystery for everyone else.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Whoa, now this is fancy! The Opera Epiclese... What a place to hold a performance, no wonder Lyney and Lynette were looking forward to it.
Paimon: Huh? Looks like there's a lot of people standing around the fountain up ahead.
Joliot: O Archon... please bless us with a bright and healthy child. We pray—
Irimia: ...I don't know why you always feel the need to ask so much... I'll be happy as long as our child is healthy, and lives a peaceful life.
Joliot: Hehe, I guess if they're our kid, then there's no doubt they'll turn out smart.
Paimon: Maybe this is one of the customs in Fontaine? There sure are a lot of couples here...
Oceanid?: "Vacher..."
Traveler: Huh?
Paimon: What's wrong?
Oceanid?: "Vacher... Vacher..."
Traveler: Did you just say something, Paimon?
Paimon: No, Paimon didn't say anything. Are you hearing things?
Traveler: Strange...
Lynette: Welcome to the Fountain of Lucine. All the water flowing through Fontaine converges here. It's customary for newlyweds to come here and wish for children.
Paimon: Waah! Lynette! You scared Paimon! When did you get here?
Lynette: Lyney asked me to wait here for you, remember?
Paimon: Ah, right...
Traveler: By the way, Lynette...
Lynette: What do you mean? There are a lot of people here right now.
Traveler: It seemed as if...
Paimon: Huh!? Hey, you're not trying to scare Paimon, are you? Besides, it's the middle of the day, it's not the time for eerie things...
Lynette: Hmm, I see... I might be able to tell you something that could help explain the voice you heard.
Lynette: In fact, you might not be imagining things at all. I suspect that what you heard is a result of your hypersensitivity to the Hydro element. Others in my family have had similar experiences.
Paimon: #It's because of {M#his}{F#her} sensitivity to the Hydro element? But what would hearing a voice have to do with elemental power?
Lynette: When do you cry, Paimon?
Paimon: Wait, what? What does that have to do with anything?
Lynette: Just answer me. When do you cry?
Paimon: Uh, when Paimon's really sad... Oh, and when Paimon's super happy. Oh, and also when Paimon's really, really scared.
Lynette: Then you should understand that tears... contain your most intense emotions.
Lynette: Like I just mentioned, the Fountain of Lucine is where all the flowing water in Fontaine converges. Even the tears that fall to the ground will eventually gather here.
Lynette: So maybe what you heard was the intense emotion coming from someone's tears.
Traveler: Huh, that's an interesting explanation.
Paimon: So what did the voice say?
Traveler: It seemed to be calling out someone's name.
Paimon: Huh, if you were hearing their emotions, then Paimon wonders what happened to them.
Lynette: Rather than worrying about them, we should worry about my brother first.
Lynette: Don't let that calm look of his fool you, he tends to get pretty nervous just before a performance. So chatting with Lyney might help him relax a little before he goes on stage.
Paimon: Oh right, that makes sense. Let's go in and see Lyney!
Traveler: (I'm not sure whether I buy it, though...)
Traveler: The voice was coming from the fountain.
Traveler: I seemed to hear a faint voice just now.
Traveler: Whose voice was that just now...?

## Talk 6

Lyney: #Ah, {NICKNAME} and Paimon, good to see you. I knew you two would come.
Paimon: Are you kidding? We wouldn't miss it for the world. We've been looking forward to it!
Lyney: Hehe. I can tell, judging by how early you've arrived.
Lyney: But you're actually right on time. The audience still hasn't started entering the venue yet, which means now is the perfect chance for us to take you to the best seats in the house. Wait just a moment, I'll fetch the tickets.
Lyney: The opera house has assigned seating, so you always have to make reservations. I've already reserved your seats, and here are your tickets.
Paimon: Ooh! Front row seats! Thanks, Lyney!
Lyney: Don't mention it, there's no need to keep thanking me...
Cowell: Hey, Lyney! Could you come over here and take a look at this?
Lyney: Oh, I'll be right there. Seems there's an issue with the stage props over there. That's Cowell, my assistant, calling me. I'll go lend him a hand.
Traveler: Sure.
Paimon: Yeah, we'll just go to our seats. You go ahead, Lyney.
Traveler: Best get busy.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Whoa! What in the world just happened!? How did he do that!? Paimon didn't see him do anything!
Paimon: Wasn't Lynette inside the water tank? How did she disappear and then reappear out of nowhere!?
Traveler: What a show!
Neuvillette: If we could see easily through his tricks, then that would mean that his skills are still lacking.
Neuvillette: To appreciate magic, you should focus on the show happening on stage rather than getting caught up in trying to see that which has been intentionally hidden.
Paimon: Ah, guess you're right. Paimon couldn't believe her eyes when Lynette reappeared. Amazing!
Lyney: Thank you, thank you, everyone. I'm glad you enjoyed that performance...
Lyney: But our magical journey has only just begun. I've prepared even more astonishing surprises for everyone here.
Lyney: The magic of transformation and disappearance can go far beyond what you've just seen.
Lyney: I'm sure many of you are thinking that escaping the water tank was impressive enough, but Lynette is still my assistant, after all.
Lyney: In which case, I have ample time to make all necessary preparations.
Lyney: So for my next trick, I will require the participation of one lucky audience member.
Lyney: Please, if my assistants could bring out the magical boxes now...
Lyney: There are two boxes, and only two boxes. One is here, and one is there in the aisle among the audience.
Lyney: I'm sure many of our clever audience members have already guessed our next magic trick. A swap!
Lyney: Our lucky audience member and I will each enter a magic box. After one minute, we will each emerge from the opposite box.
Lyney: Now please, everyone pay very close attention to the box you see here. Don't give me any chance to make a move!
Paimon: Wow! How's he gonna do this?
Paimon: Hey, do think this is all magic tricks, or does Lyney have actual superpowers?
Traveler: Let's watch and see.
Lyney: The lucky audience member will be generated by this random number selector.
Lyney: It selects numbers entirely at random. Even I don't know who will be chosen to participate.
Lyney: Now then, let's begin.
Lyney: Ah, let me see... row seven, seat three. Congratulations! You now have the chance to experience magic firsthand for an entire minute!
Lyney: Please, come forward. My assistant will take you beside the magic box.
Lyney: I'm sorry, it might be a little cramped inside, but no need to feel nervous. We've carefully arranged everything for you to be as comfortable as possible.
Lyney: You don't need to do anything. But no matter what strange things may happen, don't come out of the box.
Lyney: If the magic is interrupted, who knows where you might end up? You might even find yourself in the Fortress of Meropide.
Liliane: Oh, okay...
Lyney: Alright, before I enter the magic box, there is one more thing I need to ask the audience to do. Could you all give me a countdown?
Lyney: Like this... Sixty, fifty-nine, fifty-eight... Just keep counting down. You can go a little faster or slower if you like.
Lyney: I won't be able to see anything in the pitch-black box, so I'll be relying on your voices to know when time is up.
Lyney: Oh, and no tricks now. If you quickly count from sixty in just thirty seconds, then I'll be in a tough spot.
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon kinda wants to count faster after hearing him say that, hehe...
Traveler: I'm sure Lyney's prepared.
Lyney: No, no, that won't do... I can see it in your eyes, you still can't be trusted! Let's practice together.
Lyney: Come on, repeat after me. Sixty, fifty-nine, fifty-eight...
Crowd: Sixty, fifty-nine, fifty-eight...
Lyney: That's right, perfect! Keep it going! Alright, I'll see you all on the other side once you've finished counting.
Paimon: Fifty-four, fifty-three, fifty-two...!
Paimon: Why aren't you counting, Neuvillette?
Neuvillette: I'm counting in my head. I think things are exciting enough in here as it is.
Neuvillette: Merely a consequence of my identity and personality. Do not worry about me. Just enjoy the show.
Paimon: Oh, alright. You looked so serious that Paimon thought you might be feeling uncomfortable or something.
Crowd: Forty, thirty-nine, thirty-eight!
Garrick: Mr. Lyney, are you all right in there? Is everything ready?
Lyney: Yes, I'm fine, I'm fine... I'm just double checking the direction of the magic.
Lyney: It would be a disaster if we get sent to the wrong places, for example, mid-air right above the audience.
Paimon: Even though he's saying that, Lyney doesn't seem nervous at all.
Traveler: I think it's all part of the show.
???: BANG!!!
Paimon: Huh? What was that noise? Did you hear it, too?
Traveler: Did it come from the stage?
Paimon: Not sure... Anyway, it doesn't seem like anyone's worried about it.
Crowd: Twenty-five, twenty-four, twenty-three!
Garrick: What's wrong, Mr. Lyney? I can still hear you moving in there.
Lyney: I seem to have accidentally knocked over a decoration. I'm trying to fix it, but it's pitch black in here, I can't tell left from right.
Garrick: Never mind the decorations, there's no time for that. The show is what's important.
Lyney: No, that's unacceptable, I want my show to be perfect. Don't worry, we still have twenty seconds. Hear them counting?
Crowd: Nineteen, eighteen, seventeen!
Lyney: Ah, it seems things aren't quite going as planned. I apologize, everyone.
Lyney: It feels like you're all starting to count faster, but that's alright. I know it can be tiring to do such a long countdown.
Lyney: Ten seconds and change is still plenty of time.
Traveler: Maybe it was just to divert our attention.
Traveler: Maybe he's just supremely confident in his abilities.
Traveler: With the whole crowd counting together, you couldn't even if you wanted to.
Traveler: I'm sure we can spot how he does it...
Traveler: No wonder he's a famous magician.

## Talk 8

Furina: Huh!?
Excited Audience Member: Is this... part of the show?
Excited Audience Member: Mr. Lyney, you're going to use magic to fix the stage now, right?
Lyney: What happened...
Paimon: Oh no, maybe this isn't part of the show... The girl was still in that box, right?
Neuvillette: This performance is over! Medical staff, with me. Gardes, secure the scene and detain all the performers. Seal the exits, no one is allowed in or out at this time!
Furina: Yes, th—that's right! If this was just an accident, then we must investigate the cause. But if this was all part of some scheme, then... then those accountable will not escape the judgment of the God of Justice!
Neuvillette: No need to be alarmed, you two. We'll get to the bottom of this soon enough.
Black Screen Text: After some time, the Gardes complete their investigation.
Neuvillette: Unfortunately, the person who was in the magic box has been pronounced dead. His name was Cowell, one of the assistants in Lyney's magic troupe.
Neuvillette: Apparently, the fireworks on stage ignited the ropes that were suspending the water tank, which then caused the tank to fall onto the stage.
Neuvillette: As of now, we are still not sure why we found Cowell in the box rather than the guest from the audience.
Neuvillette: And after an initial search of the area, the Gardes have confirmed that the girl is nowhere to be found.
Neuvillette: It appears that this incident was not merely some mishap with the performance.
Neuvillette: And there are many indications that it is connected with the case of the serial disappearances of young women.
Surprised Audience Member: Th—The serial disappearances case!?
Paimon: Ah, that's the case that Charlotte mentioned before!
Traveler: And to pull it off like this...
Furina: Hehe. I know, I know the truth! I can see through the whole thing... Really, using such a shallow and obvious mystery as his "finale"... Did he really underestimate us that badly?
Furina: I say that our powerful magician, Mr. Lyney, is now the prime suspect for the serial disappearances case.
Lyney: Huh, why me? This whole thing was an accident!
Furina: This all occurred during your magic show, did it not? The missing girl disappeared after being chosen, did she not? The deceased is one of your assistants, is he not?
Furina: Now that I think about it, that whole speech about magicians making things disappear was nothing more than a provocation, a bald-faced challenge!
Paimon: That can't be right... How could Lyney do this?
Paimon: He was in the box on stage the entire time. We could even hear his voice.
Paimon: Besides, before the show he told us that he would like to catch the criminal behind the disappearances. He couldn't possibly mean catching himself!
Traveler: He's a suspect at most.
Neuvillette: Save discussion for a later time, please. Lady Furina, may I assume that your comments just now constitute an accusation against Mr. Lyney and his associates and that you are pressing charges?
Furina: Huh? I just think that he... Well, I, ah, think it might be a little early to talk about formally pressing charges...
Excited Audience Member: But what Lady Furina said just now makes perfect sense! Looks like she's gonna personally deliver justice!
Surprised Audience Member: A kidnapping and murder carried out under the cover of a magic show. Lady Furina said it all.
Furina: *cough* Ahem, uh... I mean... of course, my dear people! But what excites me even more than the obvious truth before our eyes... is the opponent I'll be facing.
Furina: That's right, I mean you, Traveler. You'll support Lyney, won't you? After all, he was the one who helped you the first time we met.
Traveler: I trust Lyney.
Furina: Haha, then there's no problem at all. You know, the Traveler and I already had a duel the first time we met.
Furina: But with Lyney's help, our little duel ended in a draw! Hehe... But draws really are the most boring possible outcome...
Furina: So no more draws! Between the two of us, there must be a clear winner and loser. And what better place to hold such a riveting showdown and decide the true victor than here, on the grandest of stages, the Opera Epiclese!
Paimon: Huh? It wasn't a draw, she obviously lost last time...
Neuvillette: I understand. Charges have now been pressed, and as such, a trial is in order.
Neuvillette: #Well, {NICKNAME}, seems Lady Furina has set you in her sights. But, putting her dramatic rhetoric aside for a moment, I would like to ask you...
Neuvillette: Are you willing to act as Mr. Lyney's attorney and defend him in this case?
Traveler: Yes, I am.
Neuvillette: Very well. The trial will be held a day from now in the opera house. Both sides may investigate the scene to build their cases and search for the truth.
Neuvillette: Lyney and his troupe are all potential suspects and shall remain within the opera house.
Neuvillette: The audience may begin to leave in an orderly fashion once they have been cleared by the Gardes.
Furina: A day isn't that long. Let's see what kind of case this big-shot outlander can build in such a short amount of time. Hehehe, I'm really quite looking forward to hearing it.
Black Screen Text: Everyone is dismissed and the audience begins to leave along with Furina and Neuvillette.
Paimon: Lyney!
Lyney: Sorry about everything that happened just now, were you frightened?
Paimon: Of course, who wouldn't be scared after witnessing an accident like that?
Lyney: Yeah, I'm a little shaken up myself... How could this happen? And poor Cowell...
Lyney: I know you already claimed that you would defend me, but now it's just us talking... Tell me, do you think I could possibly be the murderer?
Traveler: No.
Lyney: Good to hear... Thank you so much for trusting me.
Lyney: I'm sure everyone sees me as the biggest suspect at this point. But if you ask me, the whole thing is mysteries layered upon mysteries, such that all that's left is confusion.
Lyney: I don't know whether what happened there on the stage was purely an accident or not... and I don't know why poor Cowell was in the box.
Lyney: As for how that girl chosen from the audience could suddenly disappear, I'm afraid I don't have any answers, either. If someone tampered with my performance, then we need to figure out what they did.
Lyney: Even a skilled and knowledgeable magician like myself couldn't pull all that off in just one minute.
Traveler: Yes, it is very strange.
Paimon: Which is precisely why we need to investigate. As this book says, "The impossible could not have happened. Whatever happened must have been that which is possible."
Traveler: Where did you get those glasses?
Paimon: Paimon bought them when we were reading at the bookshop in the city earlier. Pretty cool, huh?
Paimon: Don't worry, Paimon used her own savings to buy them. It wasn't from our travel funds.
Lynette: I think they look cute on you, Paimon.
Paimon: You have good taste, Lynette. Hehe!
Lyney: Haha, that's the right attitude. Feeling depressed isn't going to help me now, I need to get back to my normal self.
Lyney: But with the Gardes watching our every move, it's going to be especially difficult for Lynette and I to prove our own innocence.
Lyney: Good thing you agreed to be our attorneys, thanks for that. We'll be counting on you.
Lynette: Yes, thank you so much.
Traveler: I won't let you down.
Paimon: Yeah, just leave it to us!
Paimon: Oh, since we're going to start investigating, Paimon has a question first. Where did Lynette go during the performance?
Lyney: Ah, well... I'm afraid that would involve some of our essential trade secrets as magicians...
Lynette: The secrets behind our magic are past saving, Lyney.
Lyney: I suppose you're right. The truth behind our tricks is going to be important evidence that will be weighed during the trial.
Lyney: Ah! 'Tis truly a pity. As a magician, our magic show is a work of art. We've poured countless hours and spared no effort in perfecting it.
Lyney: But if revealing our secrets will help you uncover the truth behind what happened, then it will be well worth it.
Lyney: We should go somewhere else if we're going to discuss our magic tricks. We'll go speak with the Gardes, and in the meantime, you can go investigate the stage and the seating areas.
Paimon: Alright, let's go have a look while the investigation teams are still here. Detective Paimon is on the case!
Traveler: I'm used to this sort of thing.
Traveler: But there's no denying what happened.
Traveler: It's hard to say...
Lyney: I understand. Even I'm not sure what happened, so I can only imagine how difficult it is for you to grasp the situation.
Traveler: It's hard to believe all this happened during the show.
Traveler: In front of an audience including the Archon and Chief Justice.
