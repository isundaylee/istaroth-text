Traveler: Tell me about yourself...
Umm: I'm the longest living resident here... One of them anyway. Perhaps only Keon, who's a few years my elder, can compete with me.
Umm: It was a blessing in disguise, this carefree life in the forest.
Umm: I was a researcher of the Akademiya in my youth, but I was caught up in vicious academic competition.
Umm: Hmph! I didn't want to fight with those unethical researchers. A secluded life in the forest was way better.
Umm: It was at here where I realized that knowledge, power, and wealth are the source of our troubles, and that a simple life is the best life.
Umm: Those youngsters from the Akademiya should learn the Forest Rangers' way of life!
