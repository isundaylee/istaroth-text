Coyopa: The Pyro Archon seems to have been pretty busy lately. The Masters of the Night-Wind haven't made any big announcements, have they?
Coa: No news on my end. How about you?
Coyopa: Uh... If I knew what was going on, why would I be asking you?
Coyopa: ...Well, either way, nothing much we can do about it, and there's no point in just standing here. Why don't we go grab a drink instead?
Coa: You're not trying to trick me into going to Xocolatl Beverages again, are you? How about... No.

Coa: No news on my end.
Coa: Come to think of it though, the Pyro Archon seems to have got everyone searching for a Fatui Harbinger, and there's talk that someone from the Masters of the Night-Wind might be caught up in it all.
Coyopa: Oh? That doesn't sound too good...
Coa: *sigh* Things have been a bit too eventful recently for my liking too.
Coa: So... How about that drink?

Coyopa: Tlilhua, Vilca, Ekwensu...
Coa: Kwame, Purum, Inna...
Coa: Oh, and Nzinga too... Despite being a rookie, she still went without the slightest hint of hesitation...
Coyopa: It's reached the point that I'm actually hoping for new announcements from the Masters of the Night-Wind.
Coa: We could all use some good news, that's for sure.
Coa: But let us not be discouraged! We must not forget the necessity of sacrifice, or the victory we strive for.
Coyopa: You're right.
Coyopa: If we get some free time... How about we invite the Pyro Archon out for a drink?

Coyopa: Have you got everything sorted?
Coa: Of course. I may not much like paperwork, but I'll manage â€” through gritted teeth, if I must.
Coyopa: Impressive. The losses and casualties from the war, not to mention the resources needed for reconstruction... Just thinking about it makes my head spin.
Coa: *sigh* It's all done now. Let these records gather dust in the Speaker's Chamber. It's time for Natlan to welcome a new dawn.
Coyopa: Well said!
Coyopa: Although, seeing as everything's over... There's something I've been meaning to ask...
Coa: Huh? What is it? Don't be shy.
Coyopa: Those... fragments in the sky. What are they?
Coa: Oh! You're curious about those? I'd like to know as well.
Coa: How about we ask the Pyro Archon the next time we go for a drink?
