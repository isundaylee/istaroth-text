Hao: Ah, so you're the rumored Traveler, our hero and savior! Thanks to you, we can finally get back to mining and earning a living.
Hao: I mean, it just feels like I'm missing a little something in my day when Tu's not boasting away somewhere. Nor do I really know what he's been pondering recently, anyway.

Traveler: Well, he's not very far off.
Hao: I know. I actually met up with him two days ago. But though we weren't that far from each other, he had his business and I had mine, so we didn't speak much.
Hao: But our manager, Muning, bless his heart, has allowed him to continue doing some odd jobs. If not for that, he'd have nowhere to go.

Traveler: Save Mora?
Hao: That's right. Once I save up enough, Tu and I will go to Liyue Harbor to have a look around. The way I see it, he's a pretty good storyteller... Who knows, he might be able to do this for a living at some point.
Hao: Well, as for me, I'm quite used to doing hard labor to earn my Mora, so I wouldn't be too sure about such prospects myself.
