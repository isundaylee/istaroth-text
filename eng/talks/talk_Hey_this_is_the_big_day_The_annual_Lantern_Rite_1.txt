Kun: Hey, this is the big day! The annual Lantern Rite is finally here!
Kun: All of Liyue Harbor is already bustling with excitement around us. It's not often that you'll see the city in such a festive state.
Kun: ...But when it comes to Lantern Rite, the Mingxiao Lantern is the moment everyone's waiting for.
Kun: On the final of Lantern Rite, they'll release the Mingxiao Lantern, built by the efforts of all the people of Liyue, and the lantern will slowly ascend into the night sky. It'll be a moment you won't want to miss.
Kun: But I needn't say more. Take a walk around and take in all the festivities for yourself.
