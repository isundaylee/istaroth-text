Changchang: I've got a new wish this Lantern Rite — just once, I wanna see the fireworks with Daddy!
Changchang: If he can't make it this year, then next time, then next-next time, and next-next-next time... One day, my wish will come true!

Traveler: About Silk Flowers...
Changchang: Huh? Did you see that thing I wrote? Wow, that worked better than I thought...
Changchang: So did you already finish gathering three Silk Flowers?
Traveler: Here they are.
Traveler: Not yet...
Changchang: Okay... But remember to bring them right back to me as soon as you've got 'em. I'm going to make a pretty garland.

Traveler: Hello.
Changchang: Hee-hee, everyone says I'm very polite for my age. Are you waiting for someone too?
Traveler: Are you here on your own?
Changchang: Yep! But it's okay, I'm very grown-up for my age and I play by myself all the time! Granddad works in the Dockyard as a conduction worker... conduction...? Construction, construction worker. I made a boo-boo again.
Changchang: I'm not scared though, everyone's really nice here and there's the Millelith to beat up all the bad guys!
Traveler: What're you playing now?
Changchang: Right now I'm not playing. I'm doing something very important!
Changchang: I'm waiting for Daddy. I've lost count of how many days he's been away now...
Changchang: But whenever Daddy comes home he always brings lots and lots of pressies!
Changchang: Last time, he brought me some new clothes! And the time before that, he brought me a windmill! And the time before that, he brought me loads and loads and loads of candy!
Changchang: ...And the time before that, he brought me, erm, a porcelain doll! And, and, and... Wolfhook Cake! And a little bottle that lights up in the wind! And a purple hourglass! And...

## Talk 1

Changchang: Ah, how am I going to feed it...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Changchang: I'm wondering how to feed the puppy that I met earlier.
Changchang: Granddad said before that the city was in too much of a mess, and he wouldn't let me go feed it.
Changchang: Although he says that everything's fine in the city now, he's been too busy to take me there...
Changchang: We haven't fed that puppy for so long... I hope it hasn't starved yet. Granddad says that puppies can find food for themselves, but I'm worried.
Changchang: Could you help me go to the city gate and feed my puppy?
Traveler: Gotcha.
Changchang: Yay! Thanks!
Traveler: What should I feed it?
Changchang: Granddad usually prepares the doggy food, but it's Fowl... I think.
Changchang: Um, then... Could you help me get a portion of Fowl to feed our puppy with?
Changchang: Please hurry — I... I don't want it to starve...
Traveler: I've got a fear of dogs...
Changchang: Oh, don't be scared! It's a good puppy, it won't bite you.
Changchang: I'm counting on you, then!

## Talk 5

Changchang: I'm Changchang, I just donated Dolly. She's my ragdoll.
Changchang: Last night in my dream, Dolly told me her wish was to fly up into the sky and see the view.
Changchang: So I gave her to the lady over by the big deer lantern. Dolly's wish will come true now, won't it?
Changchang: I did the right thing, didn't I? Wishes are supposed to come true at Lantern Rite, aren't they?
