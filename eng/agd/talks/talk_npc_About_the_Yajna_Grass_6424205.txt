Traveler: About the Yajna Grass...
Aranaga: Already became dust in the wind, the Yajna Grass. Nara probably see it that way.
Aranaga: But... It is radiant again from the forest plants, those already floated away, deeply buried, memories of green leaves with no trace... Every time new Yajna Grass grows new sprouts.
Aranaga: #Nara Traveler and White Floaty are the same. New friends, also old friends. Because have withered and are reborn.
