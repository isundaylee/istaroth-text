# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Come again?
Ella Musk: ...Hmm? Ohâ€” Sorry, I was off in my own world.
Ella Musk: That was Hilichurlian for "Hello there! Have you eaten?"
Traveler: Why does it sound so hostile?
Ella Musk: Are you questioning my academic credentials!?
Ella Musk: Hmph... Well, I suppose that's not unusual. Hilichurlian Linguistics is severely underdeveloped as an academic discipline, so I still have a lot of questions regarding the exact meaning of certain words...
Ella Musk: The biggest gap in Hilichurlian Linguistics is field work. If I had the chance to communicate face to face with a hilichurl, it would shed light on so many burning questions, it's just...
Traveler: It's just what?
Ella Musk: *sigh* It's just... It's difficult to find anyone who would ever dare to approach a hilichurl, let alone try to talk to them. If someone could test out my theories on my behalf, that would be great...
Traveler: Why is this the subject of your research?
Ella Musk: Don't you think that hilichurls are very interesting life-forms?
Ella Musk: It's a pity that so few people think the same way as I do. At best, you could say that it's just Miss Sucrose who does.
Ella Musk: But our methodologies differ. What I'm studying is living hilichurls, while she seems more interested in their bones.
