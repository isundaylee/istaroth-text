# Exploding Population


## Talk 1

Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild.
Katheryne: We've recently received a commission from the Fishing Association, claiming that the fish activity in the nearby waters has been abnormal.
Katheryne: Unfortunately, their report does not mention any specifics. Could you help us check in on the situation?
Katheryne: I have full faith that no matter what the problem is, you will overcome it with ease.
Traveler: Fishing Association? Is it that fishing?
Katheryne: Huh? "That fishing"? I'm not sure I understand... Is there any other kind of fishing to speak of?
Paimon: Ooh, the Fishing Association... The Fishing Association... Sure sounds like they're in the business of catching delicious fish!
Paimon: Well, there's no time to lose — let's go check this out! Hehehe...

## Talk 2

Nantuck: The fish have been really active these days...
Traveler: Do you need help?
Nantuck: Yes, and here comes my help now, I suppose! Good day to you!
Nantuck: Ahem. My name is Nantuck, senior fisherman of the Mondstadt Fishing Association.
Nantuck: Recently, many new fish species have suddenly appeared in nearby waters.
Nantuck: I immediately contacted my friends in other regions, and sure enough, this has been happening everywhere.
Nantuck: Some people say that this must be the Teyvat fish outbreak of the century!
Nantuck: Actually, the reason hasn't been fully investigated, but I guess it has something to do with the improvement of the ecological environment...
Paimon: Oh, so you guys are in trouble because there are too many fish, right?
Paimon: Don't worry, Paimon will take care of it! As long as they don't taste bad...
Nantuck: Haha, it's no trouble. In fact, the more fish, the better as far as the Fishing Association is concerned. However, we need enough manpower.
Nantuck: And to be honest, with the manpower we have available...
Nantuck: We'd be hard-pressed to catch all the new fish species for research in a short time.
Nantuck: But on the flip side, I thought, isn't this also a great opportunity for the Fishing Association to grow?
Nantuck: So I put up a commission with the Adventurers' Guild. Well, how about it? Interested in joining us?
Nantuck: Fishing is a lot of fun, you know!
Traveler: No problem, I'm good at fishing.
Nantuck: Great, what an energetic youngster you are!
Nantuck: So... Let's start by going to Cider Lake.
Nantuck: That's where the fishing grounds I prepared for newcomers is. I'll teach you the basics first.
Traveler: Can I just go down and catch them straight?
Nantuck: Isn't it really dangerous to dive straight in? You adventurers sure are bold...
Nantuck: Unfortunately, those fish are not as brave as you. All of them will be scared away if they see such a huge being jump into the water.
Nantuck: Best you refrain from doing such a thing.

## Talk 3

Nantuck: Let's go over and check it out.

## Talk 4

Nantuck: This place will do! See those little fish in the water? They're so beautiful...
Nantuck: Here, take some of these tools. We have fishing rods, bait, and formulas for making bait.
Nantuck: First, place the bait on the hook, then aim for where the fish are gathering... then cast your rod! Then, dutifully wait for the fish to take the bait.
Nantuck: I've heard that newcomers have something called "beginner's luck." I caught a large bass that was more than half a meter long back then! Well, go on then, give it a go!
Traveler: Here's to catching another Paimon.
Paimon: Hey! You shall have no other Paimon before this Paimon!
Nantuck: Paimon? What a strange name, is it a kind of fish?
Traveler: It's a sort of "wonderous seafood" that I managed to catch last time.
Paimon: Hey! When did Paimon go from "emergency food" to "wondrous seafood"!?
Nantuck: Ah, I see! I didn't realize that you were already an experienced angler.
Nantuck: Well, that just makes me even more excited to see what you'll catch!

## Talk 5

Nantuck: How did it go? By the look on your face, I suppose you got a pretty good haul! Let me see.
Nantuck: Oh? It's a newly discovered species of fish! That's wonderful!
Nantuck: You're almost catching up with me back when I was in my glory days, hahaha!
Traveler: Can you also catch fish with your bare hands?
Nantuck: Ahem... Seems like these ordinary little fish are a walk in the park for you. I should consider giving you something more challenging...
Nantuck: You might not know this, but even fish from the same species can have huge differences between individuals because of differences in living environment and food.
Nantuck: Even though they all look the same, some individuals are particularly active and energetic. They jump out of the water from time to time and are very eye-catching.
Nantuck: These individuals are superior by far in terms of both commercial and aesthetic value.
Nantuck: Many hobbyists buy them at high prices and keep them at home in their tanks for ornamental purposes. This is why such fish are also called "ornamental fish."
Traveler: So that means, apart from "Emergency Paimon"...
Traveler: There's also "Ornamental Paimon"!
Paimon: No, there isn't! How can there be so many kinds of Paimons!?
Nantuck: Yes, that's precisely how it works. Looks like you've gotten it already!
Nantuck: Recently, there have been many "ornamental fish" active in the waters near the Stormbearer Mountains, which I have marked on your map.
Nantuck: Let's go over and check it out.

## Talk 6

Nantuck: Start once you're ready. I'm looking forward to seeing what you might catch!

## Talk 7

Nantuck: How did it go? By the look on your face, I suppose you got a pretty good haul! Let me see.
Nantuck: Oh? It's a newly discovered species of fish! Most stupendous... Hey, wait, what's that other fish in your bag?
Nantuck: Wow— That's amazing! Do you know what this is? It's an "ornamental fish"!
Nantuck: You might not know this, but even fish from the same species can have huge differences between individuals because of differences in living environment and food.
Nantuck: Even though they all look the same, some individuals are particularly active and energetic. They jump out of the water from time to time and are very eye-catching.
Nantuck: These individuals are superior by far in terms of both commercial and aesthetic value.
Nantuck: Many hobbyists buy them at high prices and keep them at home in their tanks for ornamental purposes.
Nantuck: This one in your bag is a true-blue "ornamental fish."
Traveler: So that means, apart from "Emergency Paimon"...
Traveler: There's also "Ornamental Paimon"!
Paimon: No, there isn't! How can there be so many kinds of Paimons!?
Nantuck: Yes, that's precisely how it works. Looks like you've gotten it already!
Nantuck: I'm really sorry I underestimated you before... no! I underestimated the elites of the Adventurers' Guild!
Nantuck: Guess I should hurry up and put up more commissions. I have got to attract talent like you to join the Fishing Association, if that's the last thing I do!
Nantuck: By the way, if you need fishing gear in the future, you can drop by our Fishing Association to have a look. Our prices are very affordable!
Nantuck: Hehe, not to brag or anything, but we do have a good collection of fine goods!

## Talk 8

Nantuck: Back so soon, youngster? You're pretty quick, huh?
Nantuck: Let me take a look... Wow! This one here is a true-blue "ornamental fish"!
Nantuck: Y—You're definitely a first-class angler!
Nantuck: I'm really sorry, it seems like I underestimated you before... No! I underestimated the elites of the Adventurers' Guild!
Nantuck: Guess I should hurry up and put up more commissions. I've got to attract talent like you to join the Fishing Association, if that's the last thing I do!
Nantuck: By the way, if you need fishing gear in the future, you can just swing by our Fishing Association to have a look. Our prices are pretty reasonable!
Nantuck: Hehe, not to brag or anything, but we do have a good collection of fine goods!
