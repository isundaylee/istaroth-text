# Rumors Abound


## Talk 1

Sangonomiya Kokomi: This must be the Fatui camp that the merchant was talking about.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: From the looks of it, it used to be a hilichurl camp. Who knows why the Fatui occupied it.
Paimon: Uhh... looks pretty heavily guarded, how are we supposed to get in?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Not by brute force, that's for sure. But that's not a problem. The terrain here gives us an advantage, and we haven't given away our position so far.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Our enemy is in the light, while we are in the shadows. Strategically, we have the upper hand.
Traveler: And what does the grand strategist have in mind?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hmm... I think we have three options available.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Option 1: Take the king and it's checkmate. The Fatui's presence in Inazuma is weak at present. Nothing more than a few scattered remnants.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: If we strike from above and take down their leader first, the rest of them will be hard-pressed to put up a serious fight.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: #Option 2: Hit them where it hurts. Over there, {NICKNAME}, for example — a store of gunpowder kegs.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: If we managed to discreetly set the gunpowder alight without alerting them, it would deal them a devastating blow.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: They'd be caught completely off guard. Both their morale and fighting capacity would be severely impaired.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Option 3: Use the environment against them. We're close to the sea here, so the air is very humid. I can gather the water vapor, you add a touch of lightning, and together we can shock them into submission.
Paimon: Wow, that's our grand strategist! It's a lot to think about though... which option should we choose?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: That will depend on our assessment of our own abilities.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: A surprise attack from the air is the quickest solution, but requires superior combat skills.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: With an explosion, we could rapidly reduce their numbers without a protracted battle. But absolute stealth would be required during the operation, or we'd risk exposing ourselves.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: #If we decide to take advantage of the environment, we should be prepared for a lengthy siege. So, {NICKNAME}, which is your preferred option?
Traveler: Surprise air raid.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Haha... There's the Swordfish captain I know. Every confidence in your abilities.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It's decided then — let's fight this one together. I'm no warrior myself, but I can still provide some support. I certainly won't be dropping you into battle all by yourself.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: We should take them down as quickly as possible and retrieve the merchant's goods.
Traveler: Gunpowder plot.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Haha, it seems that you share my strategic sensibilities.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: This is my preferred tactic. It places us in the least amount of danger.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Let's work together to give them the surprise of their lives.
Traveler: Let's spark things up a little.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Alright. We'll draw them out first to minimize damage to the camp itself.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I haven't had much chance to fight alongside you in the past, I'm not sure I'll be able to keep up with your pace...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Still, not to worry. Even if I can't claim to be a warrior myself, I'm no stranger to the battlefield. This fight should be well within my capabilities.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Okay. Let's clear out the camp and find out what they've been up to.

## Talk 2

Matsuda: Don't get cocky!
Uchimura: It's no use looking for an escape route!
Naruse: Just you wait until Her Excellency finishes her investigation...

## Talk 3

Sangonomiya Kokomi: I must admit, I wasn't expecting to find the Fatui laying low in a hilichurl camp. Presumably they've been operating out of here in secret for quite some time.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: What's their objective? Are the soldiers right? Could they really be in collusion with the Tenryou Commission?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Let's scour the camp for evidence. If the merchant's story is true, the inventory should be here.
Paimon: Alright! Time to take a look around.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Kokomi~!
Paimon: Kokomi, we found the merchant's stuff. Look!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm... I see.
Traveler: Something wrong?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Oh, nothing. I just zoned out for a moment.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Let's see here... Yes, these are the stolen goods alright.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Food, medicine, farming tools... All essential for post-war recovery. He was probably stockpiling them until he could make a handsome profit.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: By contrast, it's doubtful that the Tenryou Commission has any need of these items, so the idea that he was supplying them doesn't make a lot of sense.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: In all likelihood, he's just an opportunistic merchant. Nothing quite as scandalous as Matsuda and Uchimura had imagined.
Paimon: Uhh... he's hardly a saint, though, right? How could he stockpile things that people are desperate for?
Paimon: We're not gonna just give them back to him and let him go, are we? It doesn't feel right...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Don't worry, I had already foreseen this.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: In my recently issued Post-War Temporary Decree, I included restrictions on the prices of essential everyday goods. These items will ultimately reach the people at a reasonable price.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: If he had taken the time to read the decree, it's unlikely he ever would have ended up in this predicament.
Paimon: Kokomi, you think of everything!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I wish that were true. Take this alleged collusion between the Tenryou Commission and the Fatui, for example. I'm still completely stumped.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The low energy doesn't exactly help...
Paimon: Uh... Huh? What do you mean by that?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Nothing. Come on, let's take the goods back.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It's not long now until the Victory Feast. It'll be a race against the clock to get all of this resolved before it starts.
Paimon: Got it! First we mend the peace, then we attend the feast!
Traveler: What are you thinking?

## Talk 5

Naruse: My goods! You got 'em back!
Naruse: Thank you, Your Excellency! And thank you, Captain!
Naruse: You see? I told you I was innocent!
Matsuda: Hmph... I'm not so sure. You could have easily planned the whole thing with the Fatui in advance...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Based on the information we gathered from the Fatui camp, there's nothing to suggest he had any correspondence with them.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Had it been the case, then knowing how the Fatui operates, they would have left some evidence of it.
Uchimura: But... what if—
Sangonomiya Kokomi: No ifs, no buts. We've recovered the goods. As agreed, this is sufficient to establish his innocence.
Matsuda: Sorry this happened.
Uchimura: Guess we got carried away.
Naruse: Hah! What did I tell you? You army numskulls don't have a clue — all brawn and no brains! Coming to me with your crazy conspiracies... Lay off me next time, got it?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Sir, I'm afraid you're getting ahead of yourself. You may be innocent of the accusations originally leveled at you, but hoarding essential goods is a crime under the Temporary Decree. You must bear the consequences.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: You have already admitted to being the owner of these goods, so we are obliged to respond with appropriate measures. In addition to enforcing the sale of these goods at the accepted rates, there will also be a fine, the amount of which—
Naruse: Wait, wait, wait! Your Excellency... Whose side are you on here?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I have no business taking sides. As the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island, I abide by the principle of clear and consistent rewards and punishments.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Just as merit must be recognized, mistakes must be penalized. You may have been proven innocent of the more serious allegations leveled at you, but this does not exempt you from bearing the consequences of your mistakes.
Naruse: Wait a minute! I... But...
Matsuda: Well, don't just stand there — take him away! Time to pay up!
Uchimura: Your Excellency, he says all the goods belong to him, but it doesn't add up.
Uchimura: Those with a Tenryou Commission emblem are probably his, but not the rest. Especially these ones — they're clearly for shrine use.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm... It seems the Fatui simply dumped all their stolen goods in one place. Leave the shrine paraphernalia to me. As for the rest, I'll leave you to sift through and try to track down the owners.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I know that's a lot to ask.
Uchimura: Not at all, Your Excellency, we're on it.
Uchimura: But if I may, Your Excellency... Maybe there were no signs of collusion in this case, but our people know what they saw. Something is going on between the Tenryou Commission and the Fatui.
Uchimura: I know the peace talks are coming up, so... please keep an open mind.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I understand your concern. I'll be sure to give it further consideration.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: #{NICKNAME}, I'm going to take these items back to the Sangonomiya Shrine. Why don't you come along for the walk?

## Talk 6

Sangonomiya Kokomi: #Excellent work, {NICKNAME}.
Paimon: Hee-hee, all thanks to your genius tactics!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Actually, even the best tactics live or die on the strength of those executing them.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Winning a battle takes a concerted effort from everyone involved. Victory never belongs to a single person.
Paimon: Now that you mention it, Paimon did make a pretty big contribution, huh...
Traveler: I beg to differ.
Paimon: Hey!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I must admit, I wasn't expecting to find the Fatui laying low in a hilichurl camp. Presumably they've been operating out of here in secret for quite some time.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: What's their objective? Are the soldiers right? Could they really be in collusion with the Tenryou Commission?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Let's scour the camp for evidence. If the merchant's story is true, the inventory should be here.
Paimon: Alright! Time to take a look around.

## Talk 7

Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hmm... That wasn't quite what I'd call "by the book"...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: But it happens. Battles are complex things and the situation evolves constantly. It doesn't always help to stick too rigidly to a predetermined plan.
Paimon: Hehe... Seems like as soon as the fighting started, the plan went out the window and we kinda winged it...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: And yet, the outcome is quite satisfactory. A testament to your ability and willingness to adapt.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I must admit, I wasn't expecting to find the Fatui laying low in a hilichurl camp. Presumably they've been operating out of here in secret for quite some time.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: What's their objective? Are the soldiers right? Could they really be in collusion with the Tenryou Commission?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Let's scour the camp for evidence. If the merchant's story is true, the inventory should be here.
Paimon: Alright! Time to take a look around.

## Talk 8

Sangonomiya Kokomi: You know, the earliest shrine on Watatsumi Island was not located in Sangonomiya.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It was close to the Statue of The Seven. Back then, the people of this island recognized the Shogun's existence, despite not venerating her as the Shogunate do.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: But after she struck down our protector deity, the shrine was abandoned.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Relations between Watatsumi Island and the Shogunate have soured ever since. Mistrust has become deep-rooted over time.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I've been hoping to raise all this at the peace talks and discuss it properly. Grievances have to be let go eventually...
Youkou: Your Excellency, what brings you out this way on your busy schedule?
Youkou: Oh my, you're looking a little worse for wear... You need to take better care of yourself, okay? All of our fates depend on you...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm, thanks for your concern, but I'm fine.
Yuna: Your Excellency, I beg you, heed a word of advice. After all this time fighting the Shogun's Army, peace is not something that can simply be declared.
Yuna: If we reconcile with them, the god who once protected us will have died in vain...
Youkou: Come on, that's ancient history. Besides, the fighting is barely over. We should be grateful to be at peace once more.
Yuna: I know, I know, it's just... *sigh* We should remain strong in these negotiations. We mustn't be too ready to compromise.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I appreciate your concerns. I will consider the options carefully and be sure to proceed appropriately.
Yuna: Wonderful... We're all counting on you, Your Excellency.
Shiori: Your Excellency? Well, I'll be! Fancy meeting you at a place like this.
Shiori: Do you know — my daughter's enrolled herself in the shrine maiden selection process this year. If she makes it into Sangonomiya, I'll be one very happy mother! You're a kind and gracious leader. She'd be in very good hands.
Shiori: *sigh* I'm always telling my daughter that if she gets the chance to learn from Her Excellency directly, she must make the most of it.
Shiori: I mean, just look at Her Excellency. Still so young, but so mature and intelligent. My daughter has always looked to you as a role model.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Well, if she comes to Sangonomiya, I'll look out for her...
Iwata: Ah, Your Excellency! Boy, am I glad you're here. As you know, agricultural output has taken a pretty big hit this year, let me bring you up to speed on the latest situation...
Ryouko: #Oh, Your Excellency, isn't this the captain of Swordfish II? Will {F#she}{M#he} be based on Watatsumi Island from now on?
Yukiya: Your Excellency...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Uh... Please remain calm, everyone, I'll get around to all your queries.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Though for the longer ones, I'd prefer it if you could write a report and submit it to the shrine. Then I can respond to each one as and when I have the time.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: ...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: #{NICKNAME}, are you alright?
Traveler: I'm fine.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Heh... This kind of thing is water off a duck's back for you, huh?
Izumi Naki: Your Excellency, here you are.
Izumi Naki: There's been a situation. We're still waiting on the delivery of a whole batch of ceremonial items. I'm beginning to worry that they've been stolen...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Oh, we retrieved those already — no need to worry.
Izumi Naki: Really? That's fantastic! You never cease to amaze us, Your Excellency!
Izumi Naki: I sorted through all the petitions received recently and placed them on your desk.
Izumi Naki: Also, according to the schedule, you're just in time for your meeting today on the development of the textiles industry...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: That's today? ...Right now?
Izumi Naki: Yes. The two young ladies have arrived safely, we're just waiting for you.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: #Mm, I see... *sigh* {NICKNAME}, I was hoping to take a walk around the island with you, but it looks like we'll have to save that for some other time.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Let's rendezvous tomorrow at the entrance to Sangonomiya Shrine. Then we'll go and make preparations for the Victory Feast.
Paimon: Yay, the Victory Feast! Just to be clear, we're talking lots of delicious food, right?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Haha... That's the name of the game. There'll be some Watatsumi Island specialties which I'm sure you'll enjoy.
Paimon: Great! See you tomorrow then!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm...
Traveler: This is testing my patience.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: *sigh* Me too. It does get pretty annoying...
