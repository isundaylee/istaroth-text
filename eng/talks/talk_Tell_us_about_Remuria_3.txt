Traveler: Tell us about Remuria...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Very well. The story begins before the Court of Fontaine as you know it was born...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): The Sebastos, Remus, founded a nation above the High Sea that is Fontaine, and the ancestors of the present-day Fontainians named him the "Dark Lord Remus" in their terror.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Before it sank, this body of water was part of the Great Fontaine Lake and the location where the capital of Remuria was sited. As such, these waters have the same properties as those of Fontaine.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Unlike what you hear from most histories, the people of Remuria were not ordinary humans like the Fontainians. Rather, they were a new race, their bodies having been cast from stone, with Ichor for blood.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): The Sebastos gave us such bodies in the hope that we could escape our prisons of rotting flesh and fate.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): His great vision was that we should all grasp the power of the Symphony and thereby escape the shackles of Fortuna, becoming the masters of our own destiny.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): We once possessed all of the High Sea, countless cities and palaces, flowers, flowing wine... and yet, fate found us all the same.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): After returning from the deepest depths of the sea, the Sebastos used Ichor to create imperishable bodies for the people, and still, the prophesied future did not change.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Our God King believed that it was because human souls could not escape the gravity of fate, and so he wrote the "Symphony," a music that could weave destiny.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): He believed that through this he had found a way to resist fate, but instead that path led us into utter darkness, step by step.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): And in the end, the entire kingdom sank beneath the waves, as though it had been smote by divine judgment...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): I fear that even he did not foresee such an outcome, though all the same, that is what happened.
