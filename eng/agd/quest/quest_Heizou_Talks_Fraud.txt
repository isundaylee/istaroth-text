# Heizou Talks Fraud


## Talk 1

Etsu: I apologize for earlier, I don't know what came over me.
Etsu: Oh, Detective Heizou? He can't stand people like me, I'm sure of it.
Etsu: Although he sounds polite and friendly, I can tell that he treats inmates convicted of fraud differently... He's really got something against us.
Etsu: Do you think he may have been defrauded himself before? Impossible, who could ever be cunning enough to fool Detective Heizou like that, hmm?

## Talk 2

Kano Nana: Hello there, Traveler. I must apologize for my cousin â€” he must have been causing you all kinds of trouble? He's always been quite a handful... but I promise he doesn't mean any harm.
Kano Nana: If he goes too far, please by all means put him in his place. And if he dares protest, just tell him he either does as he's told or he'll have me to answer to.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Iba: Getting on the wrong side of Heizou really was a mistake...
Iba: Eh? You two want to know what happened? There's not much to it, really.
Iba: As soon as I heard that Heizou was on the case, I knew it was over. I took the easy way out and confessed to everything. After all, what else can you do when a "Cyclone" is heading your way?
Traveler: "Cyclone"?
Iba: Heizou's nickname. It's what all the prisoners call him, haven't you heard it before?
Iba: There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide... For criminals, Heizou is a force of nature nobody can contend with.
Iba: Alas, if only I'd known...
