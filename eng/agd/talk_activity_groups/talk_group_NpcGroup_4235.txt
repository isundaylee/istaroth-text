Ziyad: Hah. That's not gonna keep me down. Just you watch, just you wait!

## Talk

Traveler: What did you do?
Ziyad: You here to punish me as well? Well, I'm your guy, Ziyad, and I'm not afraid of you!
Ziyad: I'll just say this first — I'm not going to apologize no matter what!

## Talk

Traveler: You should behave yourself.
Ziyad: Pah! Grown-ups are such a pain. All they know is punishing people... And it's not like their reasons are ever any different. I'm always too naughty for them.
Ziyad: They did wrong in the first place. I'm just standing up for what's right!
Ziyad: I mean, you tell me: would you be sad if your father made your mother cry?

## Talk

Traveler: See you around.
Ziyad: Yeah, see you. I'm gonna be out here for a bit — I'll go home once my dad stops being mad.

## Talk

Traveler: That's not what I'm here for.
Ziyad: Well, then what *are* you here for? Sightseeing? Seriously...
Ziyad: Why don't you stop bothering me and go home to your mother or something? Can't you see that I've got things on my hand?

## Talk

Traveler: I would.
Ziyad: I know, right? That's why I put a bug in my dad's trousers — for justice! Seriously, on what basis are they scolding me, huh?
