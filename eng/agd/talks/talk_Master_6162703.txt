Traveler: Master?
Xu: The master I just referred to?
Xu: A lot of our business is left up to him, including our most important silk trade.
Xu: As incredibly gifted as he may be in the art of business, his heart isn't in it. He has a habit of suddenly disappearing.

Xu: Even if you do manage to catch him, there's nothing to really accost him for anyway so...
Xu: *sigh* I can't make sense of it...
