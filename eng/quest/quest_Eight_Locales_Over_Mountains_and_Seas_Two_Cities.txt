# Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas: Two Cities' Recommendations


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hi, Sara!
Sara: #Why, welcome, Paimon and {NICKNAME}! And who's this? Some new Baron Bunny model...?
"Kichiboushi": Kichiboushi!
Traveler: This is Kichiboushi.
Paimon: Yup, this is a new friend of ours from Inazuma!
"Kichiboushi": Mm, good friends!
Sara: Ah, I see. Well then, welcome to Good Hunter, Kichiboushi!
Sara: Inazuma, huh. That's incredible... I heard Cyrus mention that it was surrounded by thunderstorms, and that there's lightning everywhere, like what happens when Ms. Lisa gets angry. That seems quite terrifying, to be honest!
Traveler: It is.
Paimon: So we're here at Good Hunter to treat Kichiboushi to some authentic Mondstadt cuisine! So, Sara, could we have one Sweet Madame and...
Sara: Um, my apologies, but we can't actually take orders right now because... Hmm, how should I explain this?
Sara: I suppose you can see that we're booked to capacity?
Paimon: Eh? But there's no one here...
Sara: Captain Kaeya put in a very expensive order for several dozen people at the Goth Grand Hotel. Our chefs are currently busy as can be...
Paimon: Kaeya? That seems a little fishy...
Traveler: He probably has some ongoing plans...
Paimon: Well, that's alright! After all...
Paimon: #That's right! There's no going without good food with you around, {NICKNAME}.
"Kichiboushi": Make Lavender Melon? Grilled Melon?
Paimon: No, no! Seriously, just how much do you like Lavender Melons...
Sara: Well, you can use the open-air stove over here any time.
Paimon: #Thanks, Sara. Alright then, {NICKNAME}! It's time for some delectable Sweet Madame — crispy on the outside, tender on the inside! Kichiboushi's gonna love it!
Traveler: You mean you're gonna love it, right?
"Kichiboushi": *rumble*... Sounds tasty.
Paimon: You see? Kichiboushi wants to eat, too! Don't disappoint Pai— Err, don't disappoint him now!
"Kichiboushi": Yey! Disappoint!
Traveler: One Sweet Madame coming right up!
Traveler: I can make some too.
Traveler: It's not that bad, really...
Traveler: Wait, what's this got to do with Lisa...?
Traveler: This is Baron Bunny.
"Kichiboushi": Baron Funny?
Paimon: Hey! That's not right. This is Kichiboushi, a new friend we met in Inazuma!
Traveler: This here is Guoba.
"Kichiboushi": Guoba?
Sara: Guoba? Are you referring to Jueyun Guoba, that dish from Liyue...?
Paimon: Hey! That's not right. This is Kichiboushi, a new friend we met in Inazuma!

## Talk 2

"Kichiboushi": Never seen this before. But smells good. *rumble*
Paimon: #And there's our Delicious Sweet Madame! You could even call it {NICKNAME}'s signature dish!
Traveler: We certainly have made a lot of them along the way.
Paimon: Right! No lack of supplies out in the wild, after all.
Black Screen Text: You enjoy the Delicious Sweet Madame together.
Kichiboushi had some reservations at first, but ultimately fell to the delectable temptations of the dish and proceeded to tuck in.
"Kichiboushi": ...Oooh...
Paimon: Kichiboushi? What's wrong?
Traveler: Did he eat too much?
"Kichiboushi": Mm! It's delicious! Amazing!
"Kichiboushi": There are things better than Lavender Melon! Mm!
Paimon: It's pretty good, eh? ...Hey, leave Paimon some!
Black Screen Text: Between Paimon and Kichiboushi, the Sweet Madame stands as much chance as a twig in a whirlwind.
"Kichiboushi": #Phew! Delicious! {NICKNAME}, amazing!
Paimon: #Wow! You actually remembered {NICKNAME}'s name! So, do bake-danuki get smarter as they eat more delicious food?
"Kichiboushi": Mm, what White Fur say?
Paimon: ...
Traveler: She's Paimon.
"Kichiboushi": Byemon.
Paimon: It's Paimon!
"Kichiboushi": Spymon.
Paimon: Ugh! You're so annoying!
Traveler: Better get used to it, Paimon.
Traveler: Try to remember peoples' names, Kichiboushi.
"Kichiboushi": Kichiboushi will try. Sorry, Paimore.
Paimon: It's not Paimore, it's Paimon. It's okay, though. Paimon's not mad anymore.
"Kichiboushi": Delicious Sweet Madame. Very good. Thank you.
Paimon: And then he remembers the names of dishes just fine!
"Kichiboushi": It was good. Not Lavender Melon or Seagrass or Berries, but it was so tasty.
Traveler: I'm glad you enjoyed it.
"Kichiboushi": Training, very fun.
Paimon: Speaking of which, since we're here in Mondstadt...
Traveler: You have a point there...
Paimon: Let's go to see Anemo Archon statue, Kichiboushi!
"Kichiboushi": Anemo Archon? Like the Electro Archon?
Paimon: That's exactly right! The Anemo Archon is Mondstadt's god, just like the Electro Archon is Inazuma's.
"Kichiboushi": ...Very scary.
Paimon: Don't worry, it's just a statue, not the real archon.
Traveler: Let's go visit the Anemo Archon statue.
Traveler: I'll make you something good later...
Traveler: You okay over there?
Traveler: Eh, I think I'm alright at this.
Paimon: And speaking of Kaeya...
Paimon: #"Paimon sees you already have the knightly virtue of modesty," {NICKNAME}!

## Talk 3

Sara: Sweet Madame... This dish seems simple enough, but it's quite the test of a chef's skills.

## Talk 4

Paimon: You see? Nothing to be afraid of!
"Kichiboushi": Mm. Anemo Archon very tall, taller than Ioroi. Very hard, too. Tall and hard.
Paimon: Paimon's... just not going to cover the differences between the statue and the real guy.
Traveler: The Anemo Archon is a nice person.
Traveler: The Anemo Archon's not very reliable, but he's a gentle soul.
Paimon: You know, Paimon wonders if Barbara's discovered the thing with the Holy Lyre der Himmel...
Traveler: "Hehe."
Paimon: And what's that supposed to mean, huh?
"Kichiboushi": Mm! Photo!
Paimon: Alrighty! Hold still for a second!
Traveler: Hopefully, she hasn't.
Traveler: Hopefully she has.
Traveler: The Anemo Archon's a gentle soul, but he's a bit of a flake sometimes...

## Talk 5

"Kichiboushi": See!
Paimon: Come on, don't rush!
Black Screen Text: You show Kichiboushi and Paimon the picture you just took.
"Kichiboushi": So cool. Very big hands.
"Kichiboushi": Go back, show Ioroi, Anemo Archon hands bigger than Ioroi's!
Traveler: I don't think any comparison can be made here...
Traveler: "Ioroi, weak."
"Kichiboushi": Ioroi, so, so weak, mm-haha!
Paimon: Hey, hey! Stop teaching Kichiboushi bad stuff!
"Kichiboushi": When Ioroi is serious, he can grow very, very big. Bigger than one hundred tatami.
"Kichiboushi": Ioroi very powerful. But Kichiboushi will become more powerful!
Paimon: Huh. Why do you wanna get stronger, Kichiboushi?
Paimon: That's right, you're pretty strong as-is, Kichiboushi. You can create that gliding airbag. You're about half as powerful as Paimon for sure!
"Kichiboushi": Kichiboushi must become more powerful and use stronger magic.
"Kichiboushi": With stronger magic, Kichiboushi can make Ioroi not-stone!
"Kichiboushi": #So Kichiboushi must train, with {NICKNAME} and Paimon.
Paimon: So that's how it is...
Paimon: —Eh! You remembered Paimon's name! Woohoo!
"Kichiboushi": Woohoo! Mm-haha!
Traveler: Keep it up, Kichiboushi.
"Kichiboushi": Keep it up! Yey!
Traveler: Well then, where should we go next?
Paimon: Well, since we've had some Mondstadt cuisine, time to pay Liyue Harbor a visit!
Paimon: We haven't tried Wanmin Restaurant's food in quite a while, too!
Traveler: We just ate, you know...
Paimon: Hehe! Different lands, different stomachs, don't you know?
"Kichiboushi": Eat! Let's go!
Paimon: Let's go! Next stop — Wanmin Restaurant!

## Talk 6

Paimon: Hey here, Chef Mao! We'd like some Black-Back Perch Stew...
Chef Mao: Eh? Guests, right now? ...I'm very sorry, but we're not taking orders that the moment.
Paimon: Eh? What's going on...
Chef Mao: Earlier, a knight from Mondstadt came with a huge order — a feast for several dozen people, no less. He wanted to bring it to... Um, where was that place again?
Traveler: The Goth Grand Hotel in Mondstadt?
Chef Mao: Why, yes, that's exactly it! How did you know?
Paimon: That Kaeya...
Chef Mao: I'm really sorry. It will be a moment before we can take your order. As you can see, our woks are all busy at the moment. Not that I have any idea how that guy is going to take all those dishes back... I just hope he doesn't waste them.
Chef Mao: This really was very sudden. In fact, we're running so low on ingredients that Xiangling's having to go out and help gather some Jueyun Chilis.
Paimon: Oh no...
"Kichiboushi": Mmmm...
Chef Mao: Eh? Who's this little fellow?
Traveler: This is Kichiboushi.
"Kichiboushi": How do you do?
Paimon: Yup. This guy here's a bake-danuki who's on a journey to hone his skills!
Chef Mao: Ah, I see. I'm very sorry, then, Kichiboushi.
Chef Mao: Speaking of that, my girl Xiangling's got a friend named Guoba who loves eating as well. The two of you might just get along...
Paimon: #Well, guess it's up to you again, {NICKNAME}...
Geri: ...Agh! I totally forgot!
Paimon: Eh? What's going on over there?
Freki: Seriously? How did we not check the dates...
Traveler: What happened?
Geri: So we booked seats at Liuli Pavilion and Xinyue Kiosk a few months back...
Freki: We were planning to try the pinnacles of Li Cuisine and Yue Cuisine before returning to Mondstadt.
Geri: But we wound up booking the seats for the same day!
Freki: Ugh, we should've checked those dates! What are we supposed to do now...
Traveler: Why not go to both?
Geri: No, that won't do.
Freki: No matter which one we go to first, our prior fullness will affect the experience to follow.
Geri: No matter which place we go to first, it won't be fair to the other — and certainly not to the cuisine they represent!
Freki: That would be doing a disservice to gourmet food!
Paimon: Stop taking turns to talk! Paimon's getting tired out just listening to you two!
Traveler: That's quite troublesome.
Paimon: So to sum it up, you've booked both Liuli Pavilion and Xinyue Kiosk for today, but you can only go to one, right?
"Kichiboushi": Mm. Kichiboushi can help! Help Uncle Brown Fur and Aunt Brown Fur go, solve problem.
Freki: Um, is this... little critter saying something?
Paimon: He says that we can help Uncle Brown Fur and Aunt Brown Fur go to one of the places!
Freki: H—Hey! I—I'm a big sister, not an aunt!
Paimon: Paimon was just passing a message, okay?
Freki: But... Going in our place, huh? It is certainly possible, but it does feel like a waste.
Geri: I think it's a fine idea. It would be irresponsible of us to cancel at the last minute, anyway.
Freki: *sigh* But it took us so long to wait our turn...
Geri: Come on, Freki, we've got time. We'll just book another slot. Anyway, weren't you all about that Xinyue Kiosk seafood yesterday?
Geri: Let's just go to Xinyue Kiosk first. we can leave the Liuli Pavilion booking to...
Geri: ...These rather unusual travelers and this... little animal?
Traveler: Could we really do that?
Geri: Sure. I'm Geri. Just go to Liuli Pavilion and give Licai my name. The dishes should also already be booked.
Paimon: Hooray! Thanks, Geri!
"Kichiboushi": Hooray! Thanks, Geri!
Traveler: Then you have my thanks.
Traveler: Why don't you each go to one place?
Geri: No, that won't do.
Freki: We want to experience both types of food together.
Geri: If not, our arguments whether Li or Yue Cuisine is better will be completely one-sided on either front!
Traveler: This is Baron Bunny.
Chef Mao: Baron who?
"Kichiboushi": Baron Funky?
Paimon: Hey! That's not right. This is Kichiboushi, a bake-danuki who's on a journey to hone his skills!
Traveler: This here is Guoba.
Paimon: Nope, this is Kichiboushi! He's a bake-danuki who's on a journey to hone his skills! He's heard that the Guoba made here at Wanmin Restaurant is really good, so he wanted to have a try.
"Kichiboushi": Jueyun Guoba!

## Talk 7

Licai: Welcome to Liuli Pavilion! Do you have a reservation?
Traveler: Geri booked us a table.
Licai: Mr. Geri... Please wait a moment, let me check...
Licai: Indeed, you do have a reservation for today. Well then, this way, please.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Geri did say he'd pre-booked the dishes...
Paimon: But this really is a lot! Were Geri and Freki really going to eat all this by themselves?
"Kichiboushi": Ooh... Smells nice.
Black Screen Text: You have a sumptuous feast at Liuli Pavilion with Paimon and Kichiboushi...
Paimon: Phew, that was delicious! How did you find it, Kichiboushi?
"Kichiboushi": Mm! Very tasty!
Traveler: I could tell just from watching you eat.
"Kichiboushi": Mm-haha! Delicious. Very delicious.
"Kichiboushi": Humans are very powerful! They can make such tasty food, better than bake-danuki food!
Paimon: Come to think of it, what is bake-danuki food made from?
Paimon: It tastes as good as it looks, and it does look good... But there's a kind of... emptiness to it?
Traveler: I'm quite curious myself.
"Kichiboushi": Bake-danuki is made from leaves, Kapow!
Paimon: Leaves Kapow... You mean vegetables?
"Kichiboushi": Leaves Kapow is Leaves Kapow. Leaves, Kapow. Very tasty.
Traveler: This all seems a little strange...
Paimon: Paimon can't stop thinking about it, though.
Paimon: Paimon's also curious... What's Kaeya doing with all that food from Good Hunter and Wanmin Restaurant?
Paimon: What's that guy's scheme this time...
Traveler: Maybe it's going to go something like this:
Traveler: "Ding dong, ding dong! Special delivery for the Fatui!"
Paimon: "Delivery? What delivery?"
Traveler: "A full course meal from Mondstadt and Liyue!"
Paimon: "Wow! It's a feast! Thanks!"
Traveler: "Thanks for your patronage! That'll be 5 million Mora!"
Paimon: "Huh? Wh—What is this? Do our activities cost that much!? W—Well, I guess we're just going to have to leave Mondstadt then!"
Paimon: ...There's no way something as silly as that could happen, right?
"Kichiboushi": Mm-haha, just like bake-danuki.
Traveler: It is quite like them, true...
Paimon: Also, is it just Paimon, or is the food better than last time? Why's that?
Traveler: The last time we were here, we were on official business.
Paimon: Hmm, that's true. Consultant this, Rite of Parting that... The food wasn't half as good by the time we were done talking.
Paimon: Speaking of that... You know, Kichiboushi, we actually ate here, together with a Fatui Harbinger and Rex Lapis himself!
"Kichiboushi": Kichiboushi once heard Ioroi talk about fat twigs.
"Kichiboushi": Many fat twigs in the forest. Very hard, very uncomfortable to sit on.
Paimon: Kichiboushi, we meant the "Fatui"!
Traveler: You know, I doubt the bake-danuki know anything about the Fatui.
Paimon: Th—That's true...
Paimon: Since we're here in Liyue, let's find a place where we can take a commemorative photo for Kichiboushi!
Traveler: Let's find a spot where we can see the whole place...
Paimon: Yup! There's this winding mountain path on the northern entrance to Liyue Harbor, isn't there?
Paimon: That should fit the bill!
Traveler: Is there a suitable location for that?
Traveler: "Hey there! Here's a gift from the Knights of Favonius!"
Paimon: "A gift? Hehe! So, you're finally acknowledging our power, then?"
Paimon: "Well, it's too late to suck up to us now! *cough* Still, what's in it?"
Traveler: "A cold platter feast from Mondstadt and Liyue!"
Paimon: "Hooray! It's a cold platter feast. Time to eat, comrades!"
Traveler: "Heyah! Freeze!"
Paimon: "Ah! It's an ambush! The Cavalry Captain is hidden inside the feast platters! Argh!"
Traveler: Might be best not to investigate bake-danuki magic too deeply...
Traveler: I could tell just from watching Paimon eat.
Paimon: Is that supposed to be a compliment?

## Talk 9

Paimon: #Alright, Kichiboushi! Face {NICKNAME} and hold still!
"Kichiboushi": Yey! Photo memory!

## Talk 10

Paimon: #Yup, that looks great. You've really got a knack for this, huh, {NICKNAME}?
"Kichiboushi": This place very pretty. Very different from forest.
"Kichiboushi": But all the boats down there, not sinking?
Traveler: Don't worry, they won't.
"Kichiboushi": Amazing!
Paimon: Well, Kichiboushi, was today's training fun?
Traveler: It's training, you know...
"Kichiboushi": Ioroi said playing is also training. Not to leave tanuki path.
"Kichiboushi": If play forgotten, will leave tanuki path.
Paimon: Leaving the tanuki path... What's gonna happen if you do that?
"Kichiboushi": Tanuki who leave the path... explode.
Paimon: What!?
Traveler: Huh?
"Kichiboushi": Eight tatami explode, leaf will disappear. Fur will turn into Seagrass and belly-drum turn into big teapot. Then tanuki become skinny like weasels, no more magic.
Paimon: Paimon's pretty sure that Ioroi's fibbing.
"Kichiboushi": Training is very fun! Very happy, mm!
Traveler: As long as you're having fun.
"Kichiboushi": Keep going! Where to?
Paimon: You know what, let's stop for today!
Traveler: You should go rest as well, Kichiboushi.
"Kichiboushi": #Don't want rest, Kichiboushi still wants training with {NICKNAME} and Paimon.
Traveler: Rest is also a form of training.
"Kichiboushi": Mm...
Paimon: Don't worry! We'll think about where we should go next, alright?
"Kichiboushi": Okay!
Traveler: If you don't rest, you can't train properly.
Traveler: As long as you're having fun.
Traveler: I'm not sure if training is meant to be considered fun...
