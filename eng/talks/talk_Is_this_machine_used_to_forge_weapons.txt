Traveler: Is this machine used to forge weapons?
Estelle: That's right. I'm very proud of this one, in fact.
Estelle: After all, are machines not eminently suited to this energy-intensive work we call forging, being able to control strength and temperature precisely as they are?
Estelle: Even someone with the most ordinary of physical qualities like me can make exquisite, honed weaponry, just like those muscled smiths.
