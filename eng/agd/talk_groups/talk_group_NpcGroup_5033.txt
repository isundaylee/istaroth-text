Estelle: You want to know about ore-producing areas nearby? Well, there are indeed some Condessence Crystals around, but I can't move my machine over there to help you extract them. You're on your own, I fear...
Estelle: That's no problem, you say? Okay, then. Allow me to mark the spot on your map. And remember, safety first while excavating!

Traveler: Is this machine used to forge weapons?
Estelle: That's right. I'm very proud of this one, in fact.
Estelle: After all, are machines not eminently suited to this energy-intensive work we call forging, being able to control strength and temperature precisely as they are?
Estelle: Even someone with the most ordinary of physical qualities like me can make exquisite, honed weaponry, just like those muscled smiths.

Traveler: Could you tell me about the "prophecy"?
Estelle: Ah, you've finished delivering Magic Pockets with that magician, I see. Good work.
Estelle: To be honest, I think he's influenced me a bit — I couldn't help but send some of my friends a couple of those pockets.
Estelle: I was originally a renowned scientist working at the Fontaine Research Institute. By right, I shouldn't believe in such things.
Estelle: But as they say, it never hurts to be prepared. A rigorous researcher should take all manner of possibilities into consideration.

Traveler: Could you tell me about the "prophecy"?
Estelle: Ah, the flood. That magic pocket your magician friend provided proved very useful.
Estelle: I wasn't a believer in the prophecy myself. But I put a lot of spare parts and tools inside, just in case.
Estelle: And boy, am I glad I did. I'd never have found them all if the water had swept them away.
Estelle: So it looks like you and your friends weren't affected too badly? Great, it's such a relief the prophecy crisis has finally passed.
