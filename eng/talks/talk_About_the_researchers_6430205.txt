Traveler: About the researchers...
Nasrin: Oh, while there aren't many of them, and they are usually in hidden spots, you'll still meet them if you stay in Avidya Forest all the time.
Nasrin: Honestly, I'm not really sure of the specifics of the principle.
Nasrin: I only know that this situation is called something like... Savada Life? It's a special stage in the training of researchers, during which they can't be disturbed.
Nasrin: So, I sometimes worry that that inexperienced Trainee Forest Ranger will disturb those Akademiya researchers.
Nasrin: Hmm... Still, since she's with the Forest Watchers, I doubt she'll be as reckless as someone who's never read the Rainforest Survival Guide in their lives.
