Kaedehara Kazuha: Blossoms in the sky, intoxicating the clouds, in drunken stupor...
Traveler: No games for you, Kazuha?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Oh, well, you were drawn to this place, too, weren't you? I did come for the festival, but the cherry blossoms on Mt. Yougou are as arresting as ever.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I like to take things slow, stopping to appreciate the mountain views or the sound of the rain... A vacation should be a bit spontaneous, don't you think?
