# Talk Dialog

Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Would you like to have a chat with me?</color>
Tartaglia: Of course. I'm more than willing.
Tartaglia: In Snezhnaya, there's a kind of liquor called Fire-Water.
Tartaglia: If a friend will join you outside in the bitter cold to drink Fire-Water and chat together, you know they're the kind of person you want with you on the battlefield.
Tartaglia: I would join you for just such a conversation.
Tartaglia: And in the heat of battle, I know that you'd have my back.
Traveler: You're not afraid that I might backstab you?
Tartaglia: This is the level of trust I place in you.
Tartaglia: If you joined me on my path to world domination, we would be unstoppable.
Tartaglia: What do you say? Do you accept my proposal?
Traveler: What if I fall first?
Tartaglia: Hah, you lack conviction in your own abilities.
