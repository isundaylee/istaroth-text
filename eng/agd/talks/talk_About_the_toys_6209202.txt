Traveler: About the toys...
Granny Shan: Oh, children love them. Intricate things, they are.
Granny Shan: I've got toys for adults too, if you'd like.
Traveler: Adult toys...?
Granny Shan: Sorry, I should have been more specific. Some toys need adult supervision â€” kites for example.
Granny Shan: Come war and famine or the peace and prosperity we know today, happiness is always something worth striving for, don't you think?
