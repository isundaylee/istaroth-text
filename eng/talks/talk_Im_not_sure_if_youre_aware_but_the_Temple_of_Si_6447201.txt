Khensa: I'm not sure if you're aware, but the Temple of Silence was first established by Lord Hermanubis.
Khensa: He was a priest of King Deshret, our Lord Al-Ahmar.
Khensa: At the time, the priests were mostly Tighnarians, which is why the design of the headgear we latter-day clergy wear pays tribute to them.
Khensa: Remembrance and commemoration... These are very important to us.
