Abundi: Hello, are you a helper, here to provide some supplies? Or a friend in need of our help?

## Talk

Traveler: About my reputation with the Flower-Feather Clan...
Abundi: Thank you for your supplies and help. Rest assured, the corresponding recompense will be yours.

## Talk

Traveler: Hello. What is this place?
Abundi: Here's the Obsidian Totem Pole that belongs to us, the Flower-Feather Clan.
Abundi: If you've been to the other tribes, then you've probably seen similar stone pillars before.
Abundi: This totem pole looked like this when I was a kid, and hasn't changed a bit. It has always borne witness to the ebbs and flows our clan has gone through.
Abundi: I believe we shall continue to soar high so long as it endures.

## Talk

Traveler: You are...
Abundi: I am the assistant responsible for looking after our tribe's supplies. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Abundi: Whether it's daily tribal affairs or our all-important flying squads, support is needed everywhere you look.
Abundi: I was a flying squad member when I was younger, and I know very well what's required.
Abundi: I've gotten old now and get dizzy as soon as you plop me atop a Saurian, I can't just stay idle.
Abundi: Being able to help out everyone here is a position that suits me.

Traveler: Sorry to bother you.
