Qianqian: *sobbing* Huh...? Um...
Qianqian: Um... Can... C—Can you help me...?
Traveler: Help you?
Qianqian: Um, that exorcist... with that blue hair... is so scary!
Qianqian: C—Can you lead him away from here? He makes me feel so frightened...
Traveler: Are you being affected by his yang energy?
Qianqian: I wouldn't dare get anywhere near him... His energy... It's so horrible! It'll make me disappear!
Qianqian: ...I don't want to disappear! Please, help me...
Traveler: I wonder if he'd consider you an evil spirit...
Qianqian: ...Well... I—I have an idea.
Qianqian: Um... I—I saw the exorcist with blue hair a—arguing with someone over there a few minutes ago.
Qianqian: I'll scare those troublemakers away, but y—you have to ask the exorcist to let me go, okay?
Traveler: Are you telling the truth?
Qianqian: O—Of course... Qianqian never lies.
Qianqian: So, um... What do you say?
Traveler: He'll be the one that decides, but I'll try to explain the situation as best I can.
Qianqian: Um... Uh, okay... So, I'll take that as a "yes"?
Qianqian: I hope the exorcist with blue hair is a good person.
Qianqian: Um... So, I'll help him, and you'll go talk to him. Hopefully, then he'll leave me alone... Sound good?
Traveler: I can get him out of trouble myself.
Qianqian: ...Yeah but... it'll be complicated. I've already got a plan, you must believe me!
Traveler: He'll have to be the one that decides what to do.
Traveler: No wonder we haven't seen you all day.
Traveler: Why me?
