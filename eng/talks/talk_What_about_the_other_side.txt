Traveler: What about the other side?
Fodil: That place is unfamiliar to me.
Fodil: When I was still working with the Eremites, I did go to Port Ormos several times, but all the work we got usually involved... kicking people while they were down.
Fodil: I decided it wasn't for me, so I left. I've never left the village since then.
Fodil: The only things I learned there that are worth mentioning are things I learned from the school of hard knocks.
Fodil: And well, now I use them to protect the village. That suits me just fine.
