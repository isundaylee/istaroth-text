# Talk Dialog

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Hello, I'm truly sorry for bothering all of you during these busy times, but I, Wakamatsu, have been obsessed with the martial arts of Liyue for a long time now and would like to train under the waterfalls like the warriors of old so that I can comprehend the ultimate martial arts..."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "If you are willing, I kindly implore you to teach me the secret arts trained under the waterfalls. I thank you sincerely from the bottom of my heart. With great respect."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Haha, this friendly foreigner seems to be under a bit of a mistaken impression. Who would really practice martial arts under a waterfall?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "If you're really interested in martial arts, you should start by practicing horse stance!"
