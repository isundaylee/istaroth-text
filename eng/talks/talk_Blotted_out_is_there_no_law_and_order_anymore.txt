Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "(Blotted out), is there no law and order anymore!? We've just been robbed by bandits while walking along the road!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "We will not let this stand! Those lawless brigands! How dare they think they can rob us!? We are the ones who rob!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "We wish to report those thieves! The ringleader was young, had red hair, and called himself Rouge or something!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Many thanks for the information, and for exposing yourselves as Treasure Hoarders."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "As for the robbery you suffered, the authorities are actively investigating. We hope to reach a conclusion by the time you have all returned from the Fortress of Meropide."
