# Defender of Childhood Dreams


## Talk 1

Childe: Here we are — welcome to Liyue's Institute of Toy Research.
Teucer: Yeah, we're here! I can already hear the sounds of machinery inside. Awesome!
Paimon: What is this place? And how do you know about it?
Childe: Based on my limited understanding, I believe this is one of Dottore's research facilities.
Childe: Dottore is another one of the Fatui Harbingers. He loves tinkering with old things, it's a... personal passion of his. So, he converted these ruins into a Ruin Guard research lab.
Paimon: Eh? So the Ruin Guards are built by the Fatui!?
Childe: No. They have much closer connections to the Abyss, so strictly speaking, they're as much our enemies as anyone else's... We just do research, nothing more.
Childe: As to why the Ruin Guards have been moving outside of this area recently... I can only imagine that he's gotten bored of playing around with them, and has lost interest in this place.
Paimon: Wow, yet another Harbinger with a bad attitude!
Paimon: But at least this explains why you were totally okay with bringing Teucer here. Seems you did your homework ahead of time.
Childe: Well... I wouldn't go quite that far. I actually have no idea what this place is like on the inside.
Paimon: W—Wait, so... are you or are you not worried about your brother's safety?
Childe: Of course I am... But no matter what the danger is, I will parry it. Isn't that what any older brother would do?
Childe: Even Teucer understands that, now he knows what he's fighting for... It's the very same reason that has nestled in my own heart for so many years...
Teucer: What are you guys chatting about? Come on, let's go in!
Childe: Haha, alright. Follow me.

## Talk 2

Childe: It's a good thing that you two found me first... Looks like using the Foul Legacy Transformation while I was still injured took more out of me than I'd thought...
Childe: I've no idea what I'd do if Teucer saw me like this — look at me, deflated as a burst balloon...
Traveler: You're not afraid that I might end you right here?
Childe: Haha! As I recall, you have siblings too, yes?
Childe: I figured that you probably wouldn't take me out in front of my little brother.
Paimon: Really milking this situation, huh?
Childe: Like I said... I can never pass on an opportunity to test my limits.
Childe: And that's why I, Tartaglia, am always getting stronger. *chuckles*
Childe: Anyway, childhood dreams are all too easily shattered. Even if you just leave them be, they will fall to pieces all by themselves.
Childe: So, someone has to protect them, right?
Childe: If you make a promise, you keep it, if you make a mistake, you apologize...
Childe: And if you give someone a dream, you defend it to the end...
Childe: That is what family is all about, isn't it?
Traveler: ...
Childe: Aha... Remind you of something, did I?
Childe: *cough* Ugh...
Paimon: Quit the tough guy act, already! You need to see a doctor right away, mister!
Childe: A fine suggestion, but first... I have a little something for Teucer. Please give it to him on my behalf.
Paimon: Eh, is this... a Mr. Cyclops action figure?
Childe: Indeed. I had it made to order by a smith some time back. I had intended to give it to him on my return to Snezhnaya, but it seems that it would make a better souvenir at this point.
Paimon: Wow... Now Paimon thinks about it, Childe's family are really lucky to have him, aren't they?
Childe: Hah. I'll also need you to explain my abrupt departure to Teucer.
Childe: You'll help me out, won't you?
Traveler: "You make a pinkie promise, you keep it all your life..."
Childe: Hahaha... "The cold will kill the pinkie that once betrayed your friend, the frost will freeze your tongue off so you never lie again."
Childe: Ah, that nursery rhyme brings back so many delightful memories. Teucer taught you that one, did he?
Traveler: Go in peace.
Childe: ...Alright. Thank you.
Traveler: ...I break a pinkie promise, I get thrown on the ice...
Traveler: Was this worth the effort?

## Talk 3

Childe: Hey.
Paimon: Childe? So you were here this whole time. What are you hiding for? Why didn't you come and say goodbye?
Childe: Partings are special moments. If he spent his final moments in Liyue seeing me all haggard and weak like this... That's not a memory I want him to leave with.
Childe: Still, it is a shame that I couldn't see him off by myself...
Childe: *sigh* I should have been the one taking him back. I do have subordinates to escort him, but I still feel a little uneasy.
Paimon: Geez, don't you think you've spoiled him enough already?
Childe: Haha. I can't quite explain it, but somehow I felt much more at ease leaving him in your care. And to think that not long ago, we...
Childe: Ah, yes. I almost forgot. Remuneration for your services — which I really couldn't have done without this time.
Paimon: Aha, so you do have a heart after all!
Childe: One other thing: don't forget our promise, now. Let's have a rematch when we get the chance.
Childe: —This time, with my honor as a Harbinger on the line.
Traveler: I'm looking forward to it.
Paimon: You'd best go rest up first! Don't come crying to us when you lose all over again!
Childe: Hahaha... Regardless of who wins or loses our next bout, I'd also like to invite you over to my home.
Childe: I'll introduce you to my other siblings, Tonia and Anthon. They're great kids, and I'm very proud of them both.
Paimon: We'll take you up on that offer! Mostly because we already made a pinkie promise to Teucer.
Childe: Haha, I'm sure that he'll be very excited to see you too. Well, that settles it. I'm looking forward to it, now...
Childe: Farewell, my friends — till we meet again, in Snezhnaya.
Traveler: I'm not gonna lose to you.

## Talk 4

Teucer: I can't find him anywhere... where did he go...
Traveler: I found your brother a moment ago.
Teucer: Really? Where is he?
Traveler: A huge number of people suddenly wanted to buy Mr. Cyclopses!
Paimon: Y—Yeah, so he had to leave in a real hurry. He didn't abandon you here on purpose.
Teucer: Oh... Th—That's great!
Teucer: But still, I was kinda hoping we could play here a little longer...
Traveler: This is for you. From your brother.
Teucer: Wow! Look at this!
Teucer: I never knew that they made Mr. Cyclopses in this size!
Teucer: Look, it even has my name on it! It's my very own Mr. Cyclops!
Paimon: You're really loving it, huh?
Teucer: You bet! My brother is the best big brother ever!
Paimon: You had a tour of Liyue, met your brother, visited the Institute of Toy Research, and got yourself a souvenir... Now that's what we tour guides call the perfect trip.
Paimon: Do you think you're ready to head back to Snezhnaya now?
Teucer: Hehe... Don't worry, I know I can't get my way all the time. That'd just be annoying for everyone else.
Teucer: So... let's go!
Traveler: Mr. Cyclops will keep you company in his stead.
Traveler: He's already headed back.
Teucer: What? Why... why would he leave without me?

## Talk 5

Childe: Phew, back together at last. You're not hurt, are you, Teucer?
Teucer: Hurt? No way. This was really fun!
Paimon: Fun for you, maybe — we were all scared to death...
Teucer: What's over there... Wow, this room is huge! Is this where Mr. Cyclops takes his friends when they come to visit?
Childe: It is. Impressive, isn't it? Now, how about a little game of hide-and-seek?
Teucer: Uh... Now? But...
Childe: Hehe... I have a surprise for you, you know.
Teucer: A surprise! What sort of surprise?
Childe: Don't worry, you'll have the chance to look for it later. But before that, you have to close your eyes, turn around, and count down from 60.
Teucer: Okay... 60 is a really long time, though.

## Talk 6

Andrei: #Sir, young master Teucer, I've been waiting for you.
Paimon: Did Childe send you?
Andrei: That's correct. Master Childe instructed me to arrange for young master Teucer's return trip. Please come this way...
Teucer: Who're you? My big brother always tells me never to go off with strangers!
Paimon: But you've been following us around this whole time...
Teucer: #Yeah, that's because I've known who you are all along, Mr. Nice Guy.
Paimon: Um... What?
Teucer: My brother told us all about you in a letter he sent back home. Sister Tonia read it to me.
Teucer: I actually recognized you the moment I saw you. I just... couldn't remember your name.
Paimon: What a strange twist of fate.
Traveler: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Teucer.
Teucer: Hee-hee...
Andrei: Young master Teucer, the boat to Snezhnaya will dock soon. We'd best prepare for boarding.
Teucer: Gee, time really flies when you're having fun...
Teucer: #Well then, see you, Mr. Nice Guy!
Teucer: I'll wait for you back home. You definitely, definitely have to come visit Snezhnaya sometime!
Traveler: You have a deal!
Teucer: Pinkie promise?
Paimon: You make a pinkie promise, you keep it all your life. You break a pinkie promise, Paimon throws you on the ice. The cold will kill the pinkie that once betrayed your friend, the frost will freeze your tongue off so you never lie again.
Teucer: Hee-hee... It's a promise, then!
Paimon: Bye-bye, Teucer! Have a safe trip~!
Traveler: Wanna make a pinkie promise?
Teucer: Yeah! Pinkie promise, pinkie promise!
Traveler: Your brother didn't say anything bad about me, did he?
Teucer: Not at all. In fact, he said that if he ever had the chance, he'd quit his job and join you on your adventures!

## Talk 7

Teucer: Oh, the door opened! Was that you?
Childe: That's right. But give me a moment over here, Teucer. I need to make sure that everything's safe...
Childe: *sigh* Maybe I shouldn't have spoiled him quite so much.

## Talk 8

Teucer: Brother... someone was saying that Mr. Cyclops is a killing machine...
Childe: Were they, now? What a silly thing for them to say... And you shouldn't go repeating it either, Teucer, you're far too young to be talking about such violent topics.
Teucer: Yeah, I knew that they were lying, anyways. Mr. Cyclops is here to defeat the bad guys and protect the world. He's my favorite toy!
Childe: Right. With Mr. Cyclops around, the bad guys won't ever get you.
Teucer: Hee-hee, that's right! Okay, I'm going to go play with Mr. Cyclops now!
Childe: Hey, Teucer, wait up...
Paimon: Th—The door's shut! Will Teucer be alright?
Childe: There's another path over there — let's move!

## Talk 9

Childe: Teucer, see that big stone cube in front of you? I need your help.
Teucer: Yay! Do I really get to help my big brother out?
Childe: You bet. Now, I'll count down from three, and then we touch it together. Ready? Three... two... one...

## Talk 10

Teucer: This... This is everything I've ever dreamed of! It's Mr. Cyclops world!
Traveler: This is the surprise your brother prepared for you.
Paimon: Wow... He actually pulled it off! And the way he knocked those Ruin Guards around was like they really were kids' toys...
Paimon: But Paimon wonders if he'll be alright after using Foul Legacy Transformation again...
Teucer: Awesome! Hee-hee!
Teucer: Boy, if these Mr. Cyclopses weren't so big, I'd sure love to take one home.
Teucer: Wait... Where'd he go? Where'd my brother go?
Paimon: Aren't you guys supposed to be playing hide-and-seek?
Teucer: Oh, that's right! I was so excited that I forgot all about our game!
Teucer: #Well mister, let's look for him together, okay?
Traveler: Mr. Cyclops is the coolest!
