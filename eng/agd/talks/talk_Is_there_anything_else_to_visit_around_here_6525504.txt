Traveler: Is there anything else to visit around here?
Conjat: Monsieur Choiseul said the Academic Assembly Hall is going to be renovated and reopened to host regular exhibitions of the products Institute research.
Conjat: But all we have to show at the moment would be clockwork puppets like the Artificed Dancers...
Conjat: If nothing else, we can rebuild Mary-Ann Memorial Park. At least the scenery there is pretty nice...
