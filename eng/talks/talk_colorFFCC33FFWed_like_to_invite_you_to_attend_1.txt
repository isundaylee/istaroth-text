Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.</color>
Linlang: Mm? An invitation? As in, a date?
Paimon: Erm, no, this is about musical exchange! By the way, do you have any songs that you like? We can play them for you â€” just to show you we're legit, y'know?
Linlang: I see... Well, I do have something in mind. I'll hum, and you play. How does that sound?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Linlang: I'm listening.
