# Talk Dialog

Traveler: What's with the long face?
Bruce: Ah, it's just a shame. Mondstadt is so... well, it's peaceful, but maybe it's too much so.
Bruce: *sigh* If only I'd been born in the days of Old Mondstadt *hic* ...just maybe...
Bruce: How is one to become a hero in such days of peace?
Traveler: By fending Stormterror off, perchance?
Bruce: Well, that certainly was an opportunity, but...
Bruce: Wait. Are you trying to ask me what I was doing during the Stormterror Crisis?
Bruce: I... I'll have you know that I was doing a sweeping survey of all of Mondstadt's safety blind spots!
Bruce: *cough* I mean, it's all water under the bridge now, isn't it? Let's not dredge it up anymore, hahaha...
Traveler: Perhaps dueling a Fatui Harbinger might do the trick?
Bruce: I... well... I mean, Snezhnaya is, after all, an ally of Mondstadt's...
Bruce: I couldn't possibly cause a diplomatic incident just like that, could I?
Bruce: *cough* I guess I should just find some other way to do this...
