Traveler: Um, don't do anything rash, alright?
Menthe: Huh? ...Oh, don't misunderstand! There's no need to worry, in any case â€” we Melusines are excellent in the water.
Menthe: When I say "underwater," I'm referring to the place where Sigewinne works. She's a companion of ours, but she looks more like a human.
Menthe: She welcomes friends from the Marechaussee Phantom to drink tea with her in her infirmary, but she's against us working there for a long time, unless we want to switch to work of a more medical bent.
Menthe: That's because many of those underwater have been sent there by the Marechaussee Phantom, so they probably wouldn't want to see uniformed Melusines...
Menthe: Is it too late for me to change jobs?
