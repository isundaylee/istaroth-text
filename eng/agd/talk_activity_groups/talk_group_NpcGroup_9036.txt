Chongyun: #Have you been well, Traveler?
Chongyun: Strange anecdotes, rumors of evil spirits... If you come across such news, please remember to share them with me.

## Talk

Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Chongyun: Hmm. If you ask me, it would be a nice place to settle down in.
Chongyun: This realm isn't as cool as the snowy mountains, but I don't need to worry about being scorched by the sun or sudden temperature changes.
Chongyun: I can concentrate on training since there's no need to worry about the effects of my yang energy.
Traveler: Not going to go outside and walk around?
Chongyun: If I do, I have to carry a parasol around and keep an eye on the sun.
Chongyun: Anyway, thank you for inviting me to such a cozy place...
Chongyun: If you need anything from me, I'll help out.
Traveler: Looks like I won't have to worry about evil spirits in here.
Chongyun: Naturally. I can assure you of that.

## Talk

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Chongyun: Alright. I actually just had an infuriating experience.
Chongyun: It went like this. Not too long ago, I heard someone talking about a book called "Anecdotes of Demons and Oddities." I spent a lot to buy a copy.
Chongyun: Who would've thought that this book was all about some dastardly, immoral villain!
Chongyun: It was really hard to control my anger.
Chongyun: It took half a day to get my breathing and blood pressure under control.
Traveler: Not quite what was said on the label, huh?
Chongyun: The label...? No, I wasn't bothered by the book's title.
Chongyun: What made me angry was... How could there be such an atrocious person on this earth!?
Chongyun: If I ran into them, I'd definitely...
Chongyun: Whoa, whoa... Calm down.
Traveler: A book's plot is usually made up by its author.
Chongyun: You mean... this person isn't real?
Chongyun: But the plot's twists and turns felt like they were unfolding right before my eyes!
Chongyun: ...
Chongyun: You don't mean... I mistakenly believed...
Traveler: It's alright, it just means that the author writes very well.
Chongyun: *sigh* I'm sorry... I made a fool of myself.
Traveler: It happens.
Traveler: I'll go explain what happened and help you return the book.
Chongyun: That's not it. It's not a matter of Mora...

## Talk

Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Chongyun: Uhh... I'd like to invite you to... eat two-flavor hot pot with me.
Chongyun: You know, because of my constitution, I can't eat food until it has completely cooled down.
Chongyun: I've always thought it was a pity... that I was unable to eat at the same time as you...
Chongyun: After much deliberation, I finally thought of a solution in two-flavor hot pot.
Chongyun: A partition is placed onto a steaming Liyue-style pot to divide the soup into two sides.
Chongyun: This way, I can enjoy a light soup base even if you have Jueyun Chili soup as yours.
Chongyun: Also, hot pot ingredients are usually thinly sliced, so I can quickly cool them down in a bowl of ice water before eating.
Traveler: Alright, sounds like it'll be fun.
Chongyun: You... you already agreed...?
Chongyun: I—In other words, we can go soon...?
Chongyun: Uh...
Traveler: Your face is really red...
Chongyun: I... I'm fine. I just...
Chongyun: Everything went better than I thought. I'm a little too happy... I'll be fine in a moment...
Traveler: I can have light soup together with you if you like.
Chongyun: Uh... Uhh...
Chongyun: Cooking in the same pot...?

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Chongyun.
Chongyun: #Good morning, Traveler.
Chongyun: Do you have any plans today?
Chongyun: If you're looking to train today, or hunt evil spirits, I'll definitely accompany you.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Chongyun.
Chongyun: #Good night, Traveler.
Chongyun: You head to bed first. Don't worry, I'll rest after another round of practice.
Chongyun: Phew... This is the last round for today...

Chongyun: How did you know that I was worrying about finding a place to practice?
Chongyun: Simple tents... and a traveler's pack... Practicing here would be great.
Chongyun: Good thinking, setting this up around your house. Many thanks for the trouble you went to.

## Talk

Chongyun: After returning from a long journey, it would feel nice to rest here before heading out again.
Chongyun: Weapons can go there, and Sigils can go under my pillow. Mm-hmm.
Chongyun: But where should I put my parasol... I suppose I'll just put it by the door.
