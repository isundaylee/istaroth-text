The second cooking contest...
Commences now!
This time...
No more games
And no holding back!
I...
Feel like I don't have a right to be here...
Hey
What you so afraid of?
You can't unbake it now
And if you don't serve it
Then good or bad
You'll never find out how to improve
If you're too scared to fail
You'll never know what real success tastes like
I...
So...
...Embrace your failure
Taste it, digest it...
That's the way to success
I dunno
Sounds like it's easier said than done...
...Mm
I'll do it
