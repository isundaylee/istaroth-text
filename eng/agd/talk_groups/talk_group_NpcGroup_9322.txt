Diona: Here, drink this. It's water with some salt and nectar in it. It makes a great recovery drink after intense exercise.
Diona: The flavor is nicely balanced, with a touch of salt to offset the sweetness. Take a sip, and you'll feel a burst of energy, plus a boost to your mental clarity... Actually, you know what â€” forget all that. Just try it for yourself!

Diona: I was expecting to see weird and wonderful things in this place. But so far, zilch...

Diona: If this carries on... I guess I can forget about trying to find any new cocktail ingredients here.

Diona: Huh? Wait, here's one! Hmm, hero convinces dragon to defend kingdom by plying dragon with alcohol... Hah! What a load of baloney!
