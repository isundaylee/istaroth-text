# A Fishy Flavor


## Talk 1

Neko: What an unteachable lot...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Neko: Ah, it's you. Those little ones have run off yet again. They really are growing most rebellious...
Traveler: Do you need any help?
Neko: Now that you have hung those metal balls around the shrine, I believe that they will be able to find their way back.
Neko: It is not a bad thing, perhaps, for them to go a little wild outside, lest they make a fool of themselves in front of the humans and disgrace the shrine.
Neko: But if they should go overboard and go hungry from when the sun hangs high to when the moon comes up... That would not be good either.
Neko: Well then, please bring these fish to those little rascals so that they may eat.
Traveler: Alright then.
Paimon: Let's pass our map to Neko to mark out, shall we?
Neko: Mmm, it seems that you do not lack comprehension...
Neko: Alright then. Go now, and quickly. I have matters of the shrine to attend to yet.
Traveler: Here's our map...
Neko: Mmm, it seems that you do not lack comprehension...
Traveler: Need us to go look for them?

## Talk 2

Neko: Bring those fish to the little ones, and quickly. I have matters of the shrine to attend to yet.

## Talk 3

Neko: You have returned. Have you fed those rascals?
Traveler: Yes.
Neko: Good, good. You have my thanks. Without your aid, those children would have played and played... and then they would have gone hungry outside.
Neko: *sigh* What a bunch of disobedient children. How will they be fit to receive the people coming to the shrine this way...

## Talk 4

Neko: You have returned. It is strange. Those children suddenly all came back, and they looked mighty frightened, too.
Neko: Did they meet some hairy churls outside, the ones with the sticks?
Neko: Still, they did come back... Wait, what is the matter with you?
Traveler: Uh, actually, I...
Neko: ...You... unfathomable human! What possessed you to do that?
Neko: You could simply have played with these children the normal way...
Neko: Meow! No wonder they were so frightened... You must go and comfort them.
Neko: Really, now. I suppose it was a bit much to ask for all humans to be like Hibiki...
