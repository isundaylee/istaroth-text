## Talk

Flora: Would you like to buy some flowers? I'm afraid you've come at a bad time...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Flora: A lot of the flowers in my shop were blown away by that huge wind from before.
Flora: Not only were the flowers on display outside blown away, but so were some that I had left near the storefront.
Flora: I still have a fair bit of stock, but the flowers put on display are the prettiest ones. A lot of customers are attracted by them.
Flora: Now, these flowers have been blown away, and I still need to clean up the store, so I won't be able to find time to pick new ones...
Flora: Traveler, if you're willing, could you help me pick some fresh flowers?

## Talk

Traveler: Leave it to me.
Flora: Great! Still, you might need to pick quite a few...
Flora: Let me see... First, please help me pick one sweet flower and one small lamp grass from the Whispering Woods.
Flora: Then go to Windrise, and get me one windwheel aster.
Flora: Finally, help me pick a Cecilia from Starsnatch Cliff.
Flora: Please come back as soon as possible once you have them. If they wilt, they can't be displayed at the storefront.

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry, I'm busy right now...
Flora: Alright then. I'll go get some myself once I can find the time.

## Talk

Traveler: Why do you like dandelions so much?
Flora: Hehe, I wonder... Maybe it's because I've been reading The Fox in the Dandelion Sea.
Flora: Here, take it. Maybe you'll like dandelions too once you finish reading it, hehe.

## Talk

Flora: Welcome to Floral Whisper. Do you need anything?

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about your flowers.
Flora: We carry a large variety of flowers. Are you looking for anything in particular?

## Talk

Flora: Sorry for bothering you.
Flora: You need to go?
Flora: I'll tell you more about flowers next time if you like.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about Dandelions.
Flora: Dandelions are so very feathery. They are my personal favorite.
Flora: The Acting Grand Master of the Knights is also known as the Dandelion Knight, as I recall.
Flora: She probably learned the power of Anemo from the dandelions, hehe.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about Sweet Flowers.
Flora: Sweet Flowers, you say?
Flora: They look nice, but most people just use them for cooking.
Flora: If you see people having Sweet Flowers in their gardens...
Flora: They are probably used to get sugar.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about Cecilias.
Flora: Cecilias! You've got good taste.
Flora: They grow in cold and windy places. Legend has it that they only bloom when it's quiet.
Flora: If you wish to cultivate them...
Flora: You'll probably have better luck with Mist Flowers!

## Talk

Traveler: *Craft*
Flora: Use combine function

## Talk

Traveler: I'd like to buy some flowers.
Flora: Certainly. We have a fine selection, whether you're looking to give a bouquet to someone or even do some gardening yourself.

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Flora: I was honestly more frightened by the storm that surrounded Mondstadt than Stormterror.
Flora: Everyone's been focused on the losses to people and property, but I'm still more concerned about the plants and flowers.
Flora: I'll protect them, just like how Lord Barbatos protects us.

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Flora: It's great that I don't have to worry about the flowers in my store being blown away by the wind.
Flora: That said, the Dandelion Seeds have also been blown all across the region of Mondstadt by this storm. Who knows, perhaps they will bloom throughout the land.
Flora: When I think about it like that, the storm doesn't seem so scary anymore, haha.
