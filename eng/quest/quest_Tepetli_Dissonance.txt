# Tepetli Dissonance


## Talk 1

Paimon: According to the map, we should be getting close.
Paimon: #Let's search the area. Stay on your toes, though, Traveler.

## Talk 2

Cheven: ...Get away from me!
Paimon: Look over there! Is that Master Cheven?

## Talk 3

Paimon: Well, they didn't put up much of a fight...
Traveler: Guess they knew what they were up against.
Cheven: Phew... Thank you so much... I thought I wasn't gonna make it down this mountain alive.
Cheven: #Saved by Traveler... Guess my luck's not too bad today.
Cheven: Ah, sorry, let me introduce myself. I'm Cheven, a gem artisan. I'm not usually this lucky, but maybe things are looking up.
Traveler: Imix sent us to help.
Cheven: She did, huh... *sigh* I didn't mean to make her worry. I wasn't planning to be gone longer than two days tops.
Cheven: But, then, I discovered a new seam of Volcanic Crystal near the Shadow Pin... It's a large deposit, and the purity is exceptional.
Cheven: I dug up a whole bunch of it and was getting ready to head back, but the phlogiston within the crystals attracted monsters...
Traveler: Our reputation has its perks...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Cheven: I panicked, and ran up a narrow path to avoid them... But, by the time I was in the clear, I ended up running into those bandits... You showed up in the nick of time.
Paimon: If the situation was so dangerous, why didn't you just drop the crystals and run?
Cheven: I left most of them behind, believe me. I only kept the purest chunk — I have to bring it back, no matter what.
Cheven: ...For Tlazolli, and poor little Nechca.
Traveler: Who are they?
Cheven: Ah, right, you wouldn't know. Tlazolli is a former Ancient Name artisan, and Nechca is her daughter.

### Additional Talk 2

Cheven: Anyway... I'm sure you've seen the state this place is in. It's all because the Shadow Pin suddenly came crashing to the ground and left behind a massive crater.
Cheven: The seam I found was closer to the outside, so it survived the disaster. Still, the crash riled up the monsters in the area, and now they're everywhere.
Cheven: I panicked, and ran up a narrow path to avoid them... But, by the time I was in the clear, I ended up running into those bandits... You showed up in the nick of time.
Paimon: If the situation was so dangerous, why didn't you just drop the crystals and run?

Cheven: ...For Tlazolli, and poor little Nechca.
Traveler: Who are they?
Cheven: Ah, right, you wouldn't know. Tlazolli is a former Ancient Name artisan, and Nechca is her daughter.

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: Why did she stop?
Cheven: ...Because of her daughter. Poor Nechca contracted an awful illness and Tlazolli put everything aside to take care of her.
Cheven: Even as Nechca's illness grew worse, Tlazolli never gave up. Like a torch in the night, she was determined to burn bright, even as darkness encroached from all directions...
Cheven: Still, all's well that ends well! Thanks to the doctor's medicine and the Great Spirit's protection, Nechca's flame was rekindled!
Cheven: Her condition has been slowly improving ever since. She's still weak, of course, and has to recuperate at home... but she's well enough to write letters already.
Cheven: She often writes to Xilonen, apparently. Her dream is to become an Ancient Names forger, just like her mother.
Cheven: Her birthday's in a few days, so Tlazolli asked me to find a pure Volcanic Crystal to give her as a present.
Traveler: So that's why you were out here.
Paimon: Yeah, talk about an important chunk of ore! What a nice gift! Paimon hopes it helps her feel better!
Cheven: I'm sure she and her mother appreciate your well wishes.
Cheven: Alright, let's head back. I'm sure Imix is worried sick.
Cheven: Actually, why don't you come with me to visit Tlazolli tomorrow?
Cheven: It's all thanks to you that I managed to bring back the crystal.
Cheven: You deserve a reward for helping us protect something so significant.
Traveler: I just hope it makes Nechca happy.
Paimon: That's right. A good mood makes for a quick recovery!
Paimon: And of course, we, uh... wouldn't say no to a little gift...
Cheven: Haha, don't worry. Something tells me you'll like this one.
Cheven: But, I'll let Tlazolli tell you what it is herself.
Traveler: No wonder you wouldn't leave the crystal behind.

Cheven: Haha, don't worry. Something tells me you'll like this one.
Cheven: But, I'll let Tlazolli tell you what it is herself.
Traveler: Is it an Ancient Name?
Paimon: Hey, the Pyro Archon said she contacted Xilonen about that already. Let's not complicate things!
Paimon: We don't need anything fancy like that. A normal gift is more than enough.
Traveler: No wonder you wouldn't leave the crystal behind.

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: So... She crafts Ancient Names?
Cheven: That's right... Or, well, she used to. Now, she just handles regular forging commissions.

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: Xilonen's in that line of business too.
Cheven: Oh, you know Xilonen? Haha, try mentioning that name in front of Tlazolli. She could sing Xilonen's praises forever.
Cheven: "The foremost expert in Ancient Names" "the future of our tribe," "the finest artisan in Natlan"... You'll never hear the end of it.
Cheven: I know Tlazolli misses the days when she used to forge Ancient Names. She'd never say as much... but I can tell.
