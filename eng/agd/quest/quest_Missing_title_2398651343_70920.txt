# Missing title (2398651343)

Traveler: Could you tell us about hunting techniques?
Allan: Draff is very experienced, and he's taught me a lot, like how to read the wind direction to prevent our prey from catching our scent.
Allan: He could even tell at a glance that the bow I had been using was no longer suited to my current skills. He then crafted a new one for me with his own hands...
Allan: Thanks for chatting with me. Allow me to give you my old bow, since I no longer use it.
