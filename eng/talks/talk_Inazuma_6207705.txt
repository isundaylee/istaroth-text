Traveler: Inazuma?
Atsuko: Yes, my home, back on the other side of the ocean.
Atsuko: Though I don't wish to speak ill of my homeland, the pressure back home is just too much.
Atsuko: If you want to leave, you have to go through several stages of application and approval with the Kanjou Commission. Most people never get the chance to see the outside world.
Atsuko: Perhaps the Shogunate really knows best in having such strict control, but the allure of the open sea and the freedom it represents grew inside me until I couldn't take it anymore.
Atsuko: So... One day when I was gazing out to see, something in me just snapped. I just took the nearest vessel I could find and set out to sea.
Atsuko: So if you see anyone wearing clothes similar to mine, they're probably from Inazuma. Please, if you see such a person, you cannot breathe a word of this to them, they cannot know I'm here. Please, I beg of you.
