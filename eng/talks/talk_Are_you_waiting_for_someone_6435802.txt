Traveler: Are you waiting for someone?
Nasir: Oh, yes. I am waiting for... um...
Nasir: I'm waiting for the boss lady's nephew. He can't really hold his alcohol, but he's pretty good at cards.
Nasir: I brought some nice booze to share with him, but he isn't in. What a pity.
Nasir: I was planning to have a look at... at that funky deck of his.
Nasir: *sigh* Why do people have to work? There's no time to eat, drink, and play with friends when you're working.
