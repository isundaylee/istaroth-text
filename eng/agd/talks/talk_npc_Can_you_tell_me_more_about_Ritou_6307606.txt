Traveler: Can you tell me more about Ritou?
Ebina Gonshirou: The entirety of Ritou falls under the jurisdiction of the Kanjou Commission.
Ebina Gonshirou: As long as you're looking to do business in Ritou, whether it be importing goods or opening a shop, you must first verify your identity and get all the relevant information on record.
Ebina Gonshirou: Don't say that I didn't remind you. If you are rude to Ms. Kageyama... Ahem, I mean the inspector, you will be deported right away.
