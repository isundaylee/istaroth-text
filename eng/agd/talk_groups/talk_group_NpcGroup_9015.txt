Traveler: How do you like it here?
Kaeya: Oh, I feel quite at home already.
Kaeya: Hmm, although I feel that "at home" doesn't express my feelings in their entirety.
Kaeya: "Surprised" is more how I'd describe the feeling I had when I first set eyes on this place.
Traveler: You mean, pleasantly surprised?
Kaeya: Exactly that.
Kaeya: It's more beautiful than I imagined.
Kaeya: It's been a while since I moved here though, so the initial sense of surprise has mostly worn off. Now, this place feels comfortable, like somewhere I belong.
Kaeya: Heh, who'd have thought...
Traveler: As in, it was a nasty surprise?
Kaeya: What? Of course not! It was a very pleasant surprise.

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Kaeya: You've come to the right person.
Kaeya: Speak your mind. I'm more than happy to keep you company.
Kaeya: Hmm... Though it's too bad we don't have anything to wet our whistles with...
Traveler: Why do you like to drink so much, Kaeya?
Kaeya: Well... largely because I like the taste.
Kaeya: But I can't deny that I also like how it makes me feel.
Traveler: I think I understand what you mean.
Kaeya: Oh really? Just from listening to me describe it? Despite having never tried it yourself?
Kaeya: That's quite a unique talent.
Kaeya: I have to say, though, that chatting with you is quite intoxicating...
Kaeya: Actually, in much the same way that drinking is.
Kaeya: So, I suppose... I'm just greedy and want to enjoy both of these pleasures at the same time.
Traveler: So all in all, I'm just another layer in your cocktail of pleasure?
Kaeya: Hahaha... What an interesting metaphor! I hadn't looked at it from that angle...
Kaeya: Let me think...
Kaeya: Hmm... Your analogy seems largely correct.
Kaeya: Save for one small detail — you, of course, are the main ingredient in said cocktail.
Traveler: So what you mean is, you drink to numb the pain?
Kaeya: Goodness, look at you, leaping to conclusions... Do I look like I've been through that much?
Kaeya: I'm quite content with my life right now.

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Kaeya: You're already here by my side, what more could I ask for?
Kaeya: #Though, I would like to know one thing. Is there any way in which I can be of assistance to you, Traveler?
Traveler: You really have a way with words, Kaeya...
Kaeya: Haha, how flattering!
Kaeya: As always, I speak only from the heart.
Kaeya: Nothing would make me feel prouder than knowing that my words of advice are of some help to you.
Kaeya: That would imply that you trust me and proves that I am capable of helping you solve your problems.
Kaeya: In fact... would you like me to compile a guide for you...?
Kaeya: It would contain all kinds of practical knowledge for at home and on the road, including the techniques I have developed for communicating with people from all walks of life. I'd like to share it all with you.
Traveler: That sounds extremely useful.
Kaeya: Hahaha... My pleasure!
Kaeya: I'd better get to work then...
Traveler: You never fail to impress me, Kaeya.
Traveler: Can I rely on your words of wisdom in the future?
Kaeya: I'm at your service.

Kaeya: Promise me that once the grapes ripen, you won't press them into juice. Grapes are best turned into delectable wine.

## Talk 15

Kaeya: Staying here feels like being in Mondstadt. The only difference is that I won't be bothered by any of my duties as one of the Knights of Favonius.
Kaeya: Imagine bringing a bottle of finely-aged wine here and having a taste... Now, wouldn't that be bliss?
Kaeya: When that time comes, let's chat as we do right now, friend.
