Granny Ruoxin: Hello there, Traveler. Welcome to Qingce Village. Have you come to listen to the opera?
Granny Ruoxin: The fireworks from this year's Lantern Rite have been most lively, and everyone here has been in high spirits. I, too, wanted to add something new to the experience this year. So, I invited Yun Jin to perform here in our village.
Granny Ruoxin: Her operas preserve the operatic traditions of Liyue while often coming up with fresh stories. It is truly a new experience each and every time.

Granny Ruoxin: Welcome to Qingce Village, Traveler. You'll have to forgive us if it's not all too lively around there.
Granny Ruoxin: Our village is comprised largely of the very old and the very young, and since those meteorites came down, some of us have fallen asleep, unable to awaken. We can only hope that this blows over soon...

Traveler: Adventure Challenge

## Talk

Granny Ruoxin: You didn't let me win, did you? Don't worry. I'm getting on in years, and I just play to relax, not to win.

## Talk

Granny Ruoxin: This was a good match. Thank you for helping me pass the time!

Traveler: I hope you will be reunited.
Granny Ruoxin: Thank you, kind child. Your words bring comfort.
Granny Ruoxin: There was a time when I used to look out for him all day long, from sunrise to sunset. But the only time I saw him was in my dreams, and I would awake to find my pillow soaked in tears...
Granny Ruoxin: Now, I do not so much hope for his return as hope that he's somewhere in Liyue, living a life of peace and happiness. I do not regret the love we once shared.
Granny Ruoxin: Thank you for being such a patient listener, dear. If you don't mind, I'd like to give you this as a gift.
Granny Ruoxin: It is something that he once gave to me... But holding onto it will only bring me sadness.

## Talk

Granny Ruoxin: Hello, traveler. Welcome to Qingce Village.

## Talk

Traveler: Are you the village chief?
Granny Ruoxin: Actually I'm not. But after doing the same kind of work as a village chief for so long, it's what everyone calls me.
Granny Ruoxin: Ours is a gentle and peaceful village surrounded by clear waters and beautiful mountains. Life is pleasant here, and we don't want for food or water.
Granny Ruoxin: The only problem is that because it's too quiet here, the young people have all moved away to Liyue Harbor or elsewhere in Teyvat. We've not enough people left to share the work of the village.
Granny Ruoxin: We old folks have the responsibility of tending to the fields and looking after the grandchildren, so that our sons and daughters can work in whatever far-flung place they want without needing to worry about the family.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about your past.
Granny Ruoxin: To be honest I wish I'd grown up here rather than in Liyue Harbor. Life would have been simpler, but more content.
Granny Ruoxin: I used to be an actress at the Heyu Tea House. I was living the high life, but when you're always acting there's a sense in which you lose touch with reality.
Granny Ruoxin: Back then, both I and the man I was with shared a dream of moving out to live in the country. We thought, even if that means no more fancy dinners and posh parties, life here will be genuine and everyone will be friendly.
Granny Ruoxin: I think I made the right choice in the end.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Granny Ruoxin: Goodbye. May your travels bring you only happy memories, and no regrets.

## Talk

Traveler: Who's this mystery man?
Granny Ruoxin: Gosh, here I am at my age sharing my gossip with an avid listener! Well I never...
Granny Ruoxin: The last time I saw him was when he boarded a ship bound for some faraway place, ready to go off on an adventure. He promised we would settle down together at Mt. Qingce when he returned.
Granny Ruoxin: Maybe you're destined to live a lie when you choose to be an actress. Because those parting words spoken by my lover when he left have turned out to be the biggest lie of my whole life.
Granny Ruoxin: You wonder if I'm still waiting for him?
Granny Ruoxin: Haha... Who knows. The luster of my youth has long since worn off, so what does it matter anyway.
