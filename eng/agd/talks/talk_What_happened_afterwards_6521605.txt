Traveler: What happened afterwards?
Damestier: *sigh* ...Most of my research team perished in the blast. Only a few survived. I was one of the survivors, obviously.
Damestier: But... Well, none of us survivors really understood the core technology, so we couldn't control the Mekafish. And we couldn't just start the research over again, either...
Damestier: All we could do was stand around watching the malfunctioning ones swimming out of control, and the broken ones just floating there.
Damestier: And just then, a bunch of reporters turned up demanding to know why we weren't doing anything about the chaos...
Damestier: But I wanted to help! I'd love to retrieve the Mekafish! But... But I don't know how!
Damestier: Oh, what should I do... Can't anyone help me...
