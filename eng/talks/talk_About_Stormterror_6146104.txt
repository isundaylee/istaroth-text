Traveler: About Stormterror...
Nimrod: That... was... terrifying! If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I would have sworn that someone was talking out the back of their drunk little heads!
Nimrod: I never want to feel something like Stormterror passing overhead ever again!
Nimrod: Please, Knights of Favonius, do something!
