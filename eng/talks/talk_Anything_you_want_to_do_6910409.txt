# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Chasca: I'd like to scout out the terrain from high up in the air to see if there are any weak spots in our defenses.
Traveler: This place is pretty safe, you know...
Chasca: I was only kidding. I just wanted to get a better look at what you've created.
Chasca: I'm used to flying so fast that I have to focus all my energy on distant targets or enemies on the ground. I rarely get a chance to stop and admire the scenery itself.
Chasca: But I guess I'll get that chance here.
Traveler: Sounds like an interesting trip.
Chasca: Well, "it's about the journey, not the destination"... Isn't that what people say?
Traveler: So, the scenery on this journey...
Chasca: Well, it goes without saying that you wouldn't normally see things from such a high angle.
Chasca: Buildings that you're used to seeing up close suddenly look like tiny little boxes, and mountain peaks that you normally see from far below seem an arm's length away...
Chasca: ...Gazing down from up high is an incredible feeling, almost like the vastness of the world has been compressed into the space of a single painting.
Traveler: Want me to draw you something to stare at?
Chasca: Oh, you mean like... a massive mural that can only be seen from the sky? Ha, that actually sounds pretty fun.
Chasca: There are plenty of cliffside murals near the Flower-Feather Clan, but not many flat, open areas large enough for a giant work of land art.
Chasca: What are you planning to draw? Any ideas?
Chasca: Actually... How about I lend you a hand? It'll go a lot quicker with someone who can fly up and check the progress, don't you think?
Traveler: Is there anything different about it?
