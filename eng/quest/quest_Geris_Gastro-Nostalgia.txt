# Geri's Gastro-Nostalgia


## Talk 1

Traveler: About Sweet Madame...
Geri: Yes, that's my commission. Have you brought me two Sweet Madames?
Traveler: Yes, here they are.
Traveler: No, not yet...
Geri: Please bring me them as soon as possible. I need to get over the taste of that Zhongyuan Chop Suey... Yuck!

## Talk 2

Geri: Oh, that aroma... It's just as I remembered it.
Geri: I can't thank you enough! Here, these are for you.
Geri: I will savor every bite... And do my darnedest to forget that Zhongyuan Chop Suey!
