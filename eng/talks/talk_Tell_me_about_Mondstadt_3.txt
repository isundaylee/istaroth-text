# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Tell me about Mondstadt.
Lawrence: Known as both "The Crown of the North" and "The City of Pastoral Song," there are no words that can truly describe the beauty of this city.
Lawrence: A new bard arrived in the city not long ago. You should seek him out if you want to feel the true essence of Mondstadt.
Lawrence: But the songs he plays are... a bit archaic?
Lawrence: ...Those songs date back thousands of years. No clue as to how he knows them...
Traveler: Are there any legends about Mondstadt?
Lawrence: You've come to the right person.
Lawrence: It's said in Mondstadt, a righteous hero often appears at night.
Lawrence: But no one knows his true identity...
Lawrence: I should stop there, or else I'll keep talking about him. If the Acting Grand Master catches me chatting on duty again...
Lawrence: Sorry, guess I'll talk to you next time.
Traveler: Are there any anecdotes about Mondstadt?
Lawrence: Anecdotes...? Not sure if this counts as one.
Lawrence: When I'm on my shift here, I'll sometimes notice the weather change very suddenly.
Lawrence: Um... Rather than a natural phenomenon, it feels more like someone is manipulating the weather. But who has that much power to do that?
Lawrence: Even the higher-ranking knights in the Knights of Favonius don't seem to have the ability to do that. How strange.
