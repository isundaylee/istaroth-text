Ninan: "Gong hei fat choy"... "Please pass on my regards to all the Uncles and Aunties"... So that's how the people of Liyue write to their families...

## Talk

Traveler: Are you learning a foreign language?
Ninan: Haha, no, I'm not doing a formal course of study or anything. This is just to satisfy my own sense of curiosity.
Ninan: And please don't misunderstand me â€” I'll never open a client's letter to peek at what they're saying. Everything I know, the clients themselves told me to help me with my learning.
Ninan: I can't leave Natlan easily, so of course, I've got to learn as much as I can from the tourists who are here to visit.
Ninan: In return, I'll also teach them some phrases in our language.
Ninan: Writing down some blessings in our language for the outlanders is always a fascinating experience.
