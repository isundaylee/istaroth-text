# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Wriothesley: I'd like to take a quick walk around here. Would you mind?
Traveler: Not at all. It's not like I can keep you in my sights all the time anyway.
Wriothesley: Our combat abilities aside, I will definitely stay put if that's what you prefer.
Wriothesley: However, you've also gotten to know me a bit by now. It's true that I'm not accustomed to staying in an unfamiliar place for long.
Wriothesley: But this is your home. We don't have to worry about danger here, right?
Wriothesley: I'm curious, that's all. I just want to take a walk around this vast, miraculous place as if I were a tourist.
Traveler: I can show you some other teapot realms, too, if you'd like.
Wriothesley: Wait, really?
Wriothesley: So, as long as you wish it, you can visit each of the seven nations without ever having to step outside?
Traveler: Want to give it a try?
Wriothesley: Haha, well, opportunities like that don't just come by every day.
Wriothesley: If you want something, you should try your best to fight for it, won't you agree?
Traveler: Got it, I'll go switch up the realms for you.
Wriothesley: And I would be ever so grateful.
Wriothesley: Obviously, I am also aware that there is no such thing as a free lunch.
Wriothesley: So, if you are ever in need of my help, don't let anything hold you back. We will always welcome you at the Fortress of Meropide.
Wriothesley: Of course, with that said, I hope you won't be coming down because of a new sentence.
Traveler: I can already see your excitement.
Traveler: I figured you would've already explored the place.
Wriothesley: That would have been true if we were elsewhere... Making sure that my surroundings are safe is essential.
