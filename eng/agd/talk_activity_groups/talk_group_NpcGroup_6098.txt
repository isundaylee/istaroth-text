## Talk

Hoa: Greetings there, my friend. Do you need a letter mailed by any chance?

## Talk

Traveler: You work for the postal service?
Hoa: More or less. Us Scions of the Canopy are quite adept at traveling through the woods at high speed, so we took on most of the messenger work.
Hoa: We'd establish Courier Longhouses all over Natlan, and help the tribes deliver letters and packages.
Hoa: Sometimes, we'd also help the tribes recruit people for events, or coordinate collaborations between different tribes.

## Talk

Traveler: Not right now.
Hoa: I won't disturb you any longer, then.

## Talk

Traveler: What sort of collaboration?
Hoa: They actually come up quite a lot. Let me think...
Hoa: Sometimes, adventurers would want to hire a guide from the People of the Springs, or request a doctor from the Masters of the Night-Wind. If they don't know how to find such individuals themselves, they'll often ask me to pass on the word.
Hoa: Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. It's only right to help each other out.

Hoa: Y'know, like when we were struggling with the Abyss. I was running here and there delivering an endless torrent of messages and letters, and after it was all over, I had to take a much-needed rest.
Hoa: But thanks to our brave heroes, I guess we won't ever have to face another war like that.
