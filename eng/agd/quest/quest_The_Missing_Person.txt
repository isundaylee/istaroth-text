# The Missing Person


## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Ryuuji: What if the Traveler is also unavailable... What am I supposed to do?
Sango: Well, that's your problem. It was your choice to get into this mess.
Sango: Oh, but fortunately for you, it appears your savior has just arrived.
Ryuuji: Hmm? Ah, Traveler! Great, you made it.
Traveler: Don't worry, I'm available.
Sango: Well, it's not like you were ever really busy to begin with.
Ryuuji: Ugh, Sango!
Ryuuji: Compared to the Traveler, you're the one who has too much free time.
Sango: No, I'm very busy. I'm busy standing here... I have to stand here all day.
Ryuuji: Even if it's a commission you're unwilling to take, your excuse is just pathetic.
Traveler: A commission you're unwilling to take?
Ryuuji: Yes, that's why I've asked you to come over. Allow me to explain.
Ryuuji: A key member of the Tenryou Commission has recently gone missing. No one has seen them and their whereabouts are currently unknown.
Ryuuji: The Tenryou Commission has entrusted us to find this person discreetly because it would be a hassle for them to look for this person openly, for a variety of reasons.
Ryuuji: Their name is...
Sango: Kujou Sara. That's right, the general has gone missing.
Ryuuji: *sigh* ...If the general was really missing, the Tenryou Commission would have flipped Inazuma on its head by now. And do you think they would only commission us for a case like that?
Ryuuji: Please ignore Sango's nonsense, Traveler. In fact, the missing person's name is Shikanoin Heizou.
Ryuuji: He works as a special detective at the Police Station. Although his rank is merely a Doushin, he is quite competent and held in high regard by the Police Station.
Sango: Ah! Do they think he's more competent than me?
Ryuuji: *sigh* We get that you don't want to help, Sango, but could you at least try not to make things more difficult here.
Ryuuji: Sorry Traveler, even though I accepted the commission...
Ryuuji: As you can see, Sango's less than thrilled to be involved in this case.
Traveler: Because the pay is too low?
Sango: Nope! Not even close!
Sango: If you really want to know why, it's because I absolutely refuse to deal with that brat's nonsense.
Sango: The only news that could make me happier than "Shikanoin has gone missing," would be "Shikanoin has been missing for 100 years."
Ryuuji: Ahem... Needless to say, Sango and Heizou have a bit of a history.
Traveler: I see what you mean... they're competitors.
Ryuuji: Hum... Ah well, it's a little more serious than that.
Ryuuji: According to Sango, Heizou was an obstacle in her path to the "Temple of Truth"...
Sango: Like a yappy dog that was constantly in the way!
Ryuuji: *sigh* Even though Heizou has... a "unique" personality, he's actually a nice guy. Really, I've learned a lot from him.
Ryuuji: So I can't just ignore this case, even if Sango doesn't approve. At the very least, I could entrust the commission to someone capable and trustworthy... like you, Traveler!
Traveler: I see, so you're outsourcing it to me.
Ryuuji: Huh? No no, it's not like that! Listen, I'll pay the entire amount originally promised by the Tenryou Commission, and I'll even personally throw in some additional funds.
Ryuuji: I'm really hoping you can take this commission, Traveler.
Ryuuji: If Heizou truly is in danger, I know he'll be safer with you by his side.
Traveler: Are you close with him?
Ryuuji: Actually, we get along great, but Sango has always asked me to keep my distance and not to act like I know him in public settings.
Ryuuji: So, when people ask, I usually just say I've met Shikanoin a few times. If it hadn't been for today's incident, I'd...
Ryuuji: Ahem... Well, let's not get into that. Anyway, could you please help look for him?
Traveler: Understood, I'll head there immediately.
Ryuuji: Well, that's about all I have to tell you. Oh, please take this commission letter from the Police Station. If you find Heizou, return there and report back to them.
Traveler: No problem, but I'll need more information.
Ryuuji: Great! We've learned that Heizou had expressed interest in Watatsumi Island before he disappeared.
Ryuuji: During the war, he apparently carried out some mission on Watatsumi Island, and once the war ended, he made frequent visits to the island.
Ryuuji: I heard you have a good standing with Sangonomiya. I think it might be a good idea to use that as a starting point for your investigation.
Traveler: I see, so you're basically the middleman.
Traveler: Because there are too few clues?

### Additional Talk 2

Ryuuji: There's no time for delay, Traveler. Oh, I sure hope Heizou isn't in any danger.
Traveler: Tell me more about Shikanoin Heizou.
Ryuuji: Oh, Heizou is quite the lively fellow! He's super talkative, active, and energetic, and he's always on the move.
Ryuuji: Sango always compares him to a buzzing housefly... which I guess must be because he can accurately sniff out every bad apple in the pile.
Ryuuji: In which case, Heizou isn't just some ordinary housefly, he's like the ace of flies!
Ryuuji: Even with his nose plugged, eyes blindfolded, and ears covered, Heizou could still pinpoint the bad apples.
Ryuuji: His skills are amazing, it's almost as if he relies on something other than just his five senses... You know, like a sixth sense! Or maybe it's pure intuition? Or he has divine favor? It's gotta be something like that...
Traveler: I see what you're getting at, but I think that's enough of the fly metaphor for now.
Ryuuji: *sigh* Sango always says I make a fool of myself when I talk. I guess she's right...
Traveler: The whole fly metaphor is pretty bad, but I'd still like to hear more.
Ryuuji: Ahem... Well, maybe we should chat another time. Sango is starting to stare at us.

### Additional Talk 3

Sango: You still haven't left yet? So perhaps you've changed your mind about looking for Heizou, huh? That would be best. Take it from me, getting involved with that guy is never a good idea.
Traveler: I'm curious, what's your issue with him?
Sango: Let me put it this way, it wouldn't bother me at all if he disappeared forever. That's my issue.
Traveler: (Smile slightly and nod along.)
Sango: Don't give me that look. Everyone's allowed to have a few people they can't stand, right?
Sango: *sigh* In any case, I guess you should get moving, before that Shikanoin causes too much trouble.
Sango: By the way, if you do happen to come across any signs of a most unfortunate demise, be sure to notify me... It'll bring me great joy.

### Additional Talk 4

Shibata: Oh, it's you...! The captain of Swordfish II! My name is Shibata. I'm in charge of the watch here. May I inquire as to what the captain needs?
Traveler: I'm here for information about a specific individual.
Black Screen Text: You tell Shibata about the commission to find Heizou.
Shibata: So his name is Shikanoin Heizou, huh? Yes, I'm familiar with the detective, he used to stroll around the area.
Shibata: Her Excellency had assigned me to keep a close eye on him at the time, fearing that he would do something unpleasant, but I eventually realized that he acted more like he was on a trip or something.
Shibata: Come to think of it, I believe he was recently spotted in the area east of the Sangonomiya Shrine. Please feel free to go there and take a look for yourself.

### Additional Talk 5

Shibata: If you are looking for the young detective, please go to the area east of the Sangonomiya Shrine.

### Additional Talk 6

Sango: Hmm? Didn't you go looking for that brat Shikanoin?
Sango: Investigate? Why would I come to investigate his nonsense? Hmph! I was tired of staying in town, so I decided to go out for a walk.
Sango: So get out of my hair and go back to whatever you were doing.
