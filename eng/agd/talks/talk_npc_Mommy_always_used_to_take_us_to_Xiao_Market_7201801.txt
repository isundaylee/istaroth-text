Yi Xian: ...Mommy always used to take us to Xiao Market...
Yi Zhu: Yeah! Mommy would buy toys for us, take us to see the Xiao Lanterns... And she'd carry you when you got tired...
Yi Xian: ...Yi Zhu, I miss Mommy.
Yi Zhu: Yi Xian... Don't cry, let's make a Xiao Lantern for Mommy, shall we?
Yi Xian: Huh? But I thought Xiao Lanterns were to remember the heroes who look after us...
Yi Zhu: You're right. Well, our mommy was a hero and she looked after us, didn't she?
Yi Zhu: So come on, wipe your tears away â€” let's welcome back Mommy's spirit and all the other heroes with big smiles on our faces!
Yi Xian: Alright!
