# Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?

A popular light novel in Inazuma which tells the story of the "good-for-nothing" Shogun and the "good-at-everything" Kitsune Guuji. The novel is in the same collection as "Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden With Unlimited Power," but not by the same author. What they share in common, however, is their popularity.
