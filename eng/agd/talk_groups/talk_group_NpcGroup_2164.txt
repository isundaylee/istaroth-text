## Talk

Wang Ping'an: Hello there. Are you here to offer incense today?

## Talk

Traveler: Could you give me a few sticks?
Wang Ping'an: No problem. Please wait a moment...
Wang Ping'an: Here, take them. The censer is right there, please go ahead.

## Talk

Traveler: Do many people come here to offer incense these days?
Wang Ping'an: A few. Not that many.
Wang Ping'an: This place is a little off the beaten track, and few people know that there is a temple here at all.
Wang Ping'an: Hmm. Perhaps I should find some way to let people know this temple is here...

## Talk

Traveler: Have you finished your book yet?
Wang Ping'an: Not quite. Heh... well actually, to tell the truth, I'm still a long way off...
Wang Ping'an: I did collect quite a fair bit of material, but some of the stories don't have enough evidence to back them up.
Wang Ping'an: I've spent goodness-knows how much time just trying to confirm which sources are reliable.
Wang Ping'an: So as for my book... *sigh* Even I don't know how much longer it'll take at this point.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Wang Ping'an: Alright. Stay safe, now. Be careful when you're out there. The roads are not that safe.
