Traveler: About Stormterror...
Donna: Every time I think that such a thing happened to us, I grow very afraid...
Donna: (If I were to be captured by Stormterror, Master Diluc would definitely come to my rescue...)
Donna: (This... This must be the part where the dashing prince saves the kidnapped princess!)
Donna: (Then... maybe our story will be written about in fairy tales... No, wait, why am I thinking about something like that now?)
Donna: Whâ€”Whatever it is, it was too terrifying for me. Oh, Lord Barbatos, please protect Mondstadt...
