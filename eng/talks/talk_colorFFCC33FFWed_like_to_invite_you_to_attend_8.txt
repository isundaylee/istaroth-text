Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.</color>
Yukio: Hmm? Did I hear you wrong? Is this a music festival or a food festival?
Paimon: Music, and a serious, formal musical exchange to boot! By the way, do you have any music you enjoy? We can play it for you right now!
Yukio: Oh, you're serious, then? Well, I do have something in mind. I can try humming it for you. Could you try playing it, then?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Yukio: Well then, this is quite the lovely surprise.
