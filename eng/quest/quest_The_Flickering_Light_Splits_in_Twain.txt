# The Flickering Light Splits in Twain


## Talk 1

Paimon: Why is it so noisy outside? Paimon's still half-asleep...
Paimon: Well... Guess we should see what's going on.

## Talk 2

Xilonen: Stay safe! We've got this!

## Talk 3

Mualani: #Traveler! Over here! Perfect — our Star Outlander has appeared!
Paimon: Oh, you're all here! But, uh... What's with the whole "Star Outlander" thing?
Mualani: Just my way of saying how awesome you are! We've got a real emergency on our hands, so this is the perfect time for you to show off your skills.
Paimon: Alright, but can we get a quick run-down of the situation first?
Iansan: The Abyss suddenly attacked the Collective of Plenty, the Masters of the Night-Wind, the Children of Echoes, and a number of our camps and outposts in the wild.
Traveler: All at once?
Chasca: Yes, and the attacks are increasing in frequency.
Chuychu: The tribes have plenty of defenses, so they're safe for now. But, I can't say the same for the adventurers and merchants stuck in the wild.
Chuychu: Chasca and I have been searching for survivors and treating the wounded. We just got back, but we need to head out again soon.
Iansan: I plan on heading back to the Collective of Plenty, just in case my tribe needs me.
Paimon: What about you, Mualani? Where are you gonna go?
Mualani: I'll go help the Children of Echoes. They're the closest, so I can start fighting right away.
Mualani: What about you guys? We could go together!
Traveler: I need to talk to the Pyro Archon first.
Mualani: Yeah, that does sound important. No worries! Just leave the Children of Echoes to us!
Mualani: Hehe, who knows? Maybe yours truly will have the Abyss on the run by the time you're finished!
Iansan: That would be pretty great, actually. I hope my tribe gets through okay.
Mualani: It'll be fine! Your tribe doesn't do all that body-building for nothing!
Chasca: Let's part ways here for now, and most importantly... Be careful, everyone.
Chuychu: Oh, and some of us need to avoid getting contaminated by dangerous-looking substances. That will make my job a lot easier.
Chasca: Chuychu, do we really have to do this now?
Paimon: Ha... haha, it's alright! She's just looking out for everyone.
Paimon: Alright, let's hurry up and talk to the Pyro Archon, so we can help the others!
Traveler: I learned a few things from The Captain.

## Talk 4

Mavuika: Oh, it's you two. As you can see, things are not looking good right now. People across Natlan are in danger.
Mavuika: Look, I'm very interested in your recent adventures, but this is not a good time, so we'll have to keep our conversation short.
Paimon: That's alright! We're also in a hurry. We're gonna go help the Children of Echoes after this.
Traveler: We met The Captain.
Mavuika: What?
Black Screen Text: You tell Mavuika about your brief meeting with The Captain and Ororon.
Mavuika: So he thinks my plan is too risky. He thinks I'm being stubborn...
Traveler: Well, is it true?
Mavuika: I shouldn't underestimate the Fatui's ability to gather intelligence... The Gnosis does have that function, but there's more to the story.
Mavuika: I will answer you honestly, but you must help me keep this a secret.
Mavuika: I can use the power of the Gnosis to save Natlan, but it comes at a heavy price.
Mavuika: The Gnosis would drain all the souls and memories from the Night Kingdom and weave them into a giant net, which would surround the Ley Lines and protect them against Abyssal corrosion.
Paimon: Wait, you can use souls to weave a net? But, does that mean...?
Mavuika: Yes, it means sacrificing those souls in the process. Souls are just another form of life... The cruelty of this method is self-evident.
Mavuika: The Night Kingdom not only houses the souls of the dead, but also our memories and legends. Using the Gnosis means converting all three into material for the net, erasing our history and culture.
Mavuika: Even then, the net can still become corroded. If we cannot find a way to repair the damaged Ley Lines before that happens, then all those sacrifices are for nothing.
Mavuika: Given the enormity of the price, it's a solution I refuse to consider right now. I want us to win, but I also care about HOW we win, and what that means for us in the end.
Mavuika: Now, it's true, both plans comes at a risk, but, after weighing our options, this is our best bet.
Traveler: I'm surprised the Gnosis has this function...
Mavuika: Natlan is unique among the nations of Teyvat. Given the ever-looming threat of the Abyss, the Pyro Archons had to account for the worst case scenario.
Mavuika: Having a contingency plan is our duty... not just to the people of Natlan, but to all who live on this continent.
Mavuika: Still, this has always been a well-kept secret. I'm very curious how The Captain learned this information...
Paimon: Oh, one more thing... The Captain said he found another way to solve the problem. Could be equally as extreme, though...
Mavuika: Without the Gnosis, he should have no other option. But, I see no reason for him to lie...
Mavuika: Seems like our only path forward is to track him down, so he can answer that question for us.
Traveler: (The Pyro Archon just shared an important secret with us, and she seems sincere. Figuring out The Captain's supposed new way of saving Natlan is the key...)
Mavuika: Judging by your expression, you must have doubted me, even if just for a second...
Traveler: Maybe a little.
Paimon: #Not even a little! We would never... Wait, what are you talking about, Traveler!?
Mavuika: Haha, just as expected. I appreciate your sincerity.
Mavuika: Maybe it was out of caution, anxiety, or simple curiosity, but know this — no matter what, our goal remains the same. We both want to save the people of this land.
Mavuika: So, now that you have your answer, do you still doubt me?
Traveler: Not at all.
Paimon: #Phew, you scared Paimon! You've really got a lot of guts, Traveler.
Mavuika: That's a good thing. Oh, and feel free to call me Mavuika. It's what all my friends call me, and I like it that way.
Mavuika: As for The Captain, the intelligence officers we assigned to the Fatui should be back soon. We'll get our answer then.
Paimon: That's great! Sounds like we just have to wait a little longer...
Traveler: Are the current attacks...
Mavuika: Not just yet. Even though the Abyss is attacking several locations at once, I'm confident the warriors stationed in those areas can handle it.
Mavuika: Don't worry — I just need to finish coordinating our available manpower, then I'll take a small team to handle the difficult locations.
Paimon: Wait, you're going to fight in person? Didn't you give up your power?
Mavuika: That's true. I'm far less powerful than a god in my current state, but don't forget — I was an experienced and powerful warrior before I ever became the Pyro Archon.
Mavuika: No matter how you look at it, my duty is on the front lines.
Traveler: I'm sure you're an inspiration to all your warriors.
Mavuika: Haha, I just think there's strength in numbers. If the people feel emboldened, that's just a bonus.
Mavuika: Anyway, even if we respond to these threats in time, it's not a permanent solution in the long run.
Mavuika: I've considered moving my people to other nations, but given their close connection to the Night Kingdom, a forced evacuation would have devastating consequences.
Mavuika: I've told the chiefs of each tribe to strengthen their defenses and advise people against leaving their settlements.
Mavuika: Now, I just need to find the right time to disclose the true nature of the crisis to the people of Natlan.
Paimon: Paimon's a little worried about how people will react...
Traveler: I think a lot of people will join the fight.
Mavuika: Yes, but that won't be the only response. In any case, that's for me to worry about. I'll let you know when we have more information on The Captain.
Paimon: Alright, we should head out! Maybe we can join up with Mualani? She can't be too far ahead.
Traveler: Yeah, let's go. Stay safe, Mavuika.
Mavuika: Heh, no need to worry about me.
Traveler: Sure you're not stretching yourself too thin?
Mavuika: Now, you doubt my strength? That hurts, Traveler. If we had time to spar, you might think otherwise.
Traveler: The beginning of the real disaster?
Traveler: It doesn't sound like something an Archon would do.
Traveler: Can the Gnosis do what he said?

## Talk 5

Mualani: Quick, over here! To safety!
Xilonen: Kachina, how many people do you have left?
Kachina: They've all made it out!
Kachina: #It's Traveler and Paimon! They're here!
Paimon: What's the situation?
Mualani: There's a trapped caravan that needs our help. We need to rescue them as soon as possible.
Xilonen: We'll go together.
Kachina: I—I'm coming, too!

## Talk 6

Todar: I... I really thought I was done for...
Todar: I can't thank you enough.
Mualani: Don't worry about it! We're just glad you're okay. Let's see... Your goods look fine, too. Guess the Abyss isn't after Mora!
Xilonen: That should be the last Abyssal Pylon near the Children of Echoes.
Kachina: Phew, that was scary, but... We did it!
Xilonen: By the way, where's Citlali? I thought she would come with you.
Paimon: The Masters of the Night-Wind also got attacked, so she went back to help her tribe. She said we can deal with the Ancient Name later.
Xilonen: That makes sense. The attacks are more urgent.
Xilonen: Alright, this isn't a good place to talk. Let's head back to the tribe.

## Talk 7

Mualani: Looks like a few people were hurt after all... *sigh* I should have got here sooner.
Xilonen: The Abyss threw a lot at us at once. I rushed out as soon as I heard the alarm, and there were already so many monsters.
Xilonen: Before long, Kachina brought over a whole group of warriors, and just like that, we destroyed several Pylons as a team.
Kachina: I wasn't in charge or anything. We just happened to be together...
Kachina: Still, I think this proves that camping in the wild was a great idea! That's how we were able to respond so fast!
Kachina: Sleeping on the wet grass was pretty uncomfortable, but it was worth it.
Traveler: I don't mean to be negative...
Xilonen: You mean the situation in Night Kingdom, right? I feel the same way. We've managed to keep it a secret all this time, but more and more people are realizing something's wrong.
Xilonen: It's impossible not to feel anxious when things are getting worse by the second, and all we can do is to wait.
Kachina: And we still don't know when the final two heroes are going to appear...
Mualani: That just means we need to buy the Pyro Archon more time! Keep pushing, everyone. Every battle is worth something!
Paimon: You really are an eternal optimist, Mualani! You always find a way to cheer people up.
Mualani: Why thank you, hehe... I guess it's one of my better qualities.
Traveler: I learned a few things you should know.
Black Screen Text: You share The Captain's intel.
Xilonen: ...So, specifics aside, the Pyro Archon confirmed that the Gnosis can resolve the crisis, but it comes at a huge price.
Mualani: And, somehow, The Captain finds out about it, goes to fight the Pyro Archon, and calls her out for having a solution but refusing to use it...
Mualani: Honestly, if he has the same information as us, I can't really blame him...
Kachina: It's probably because our plan is so risky. We don't even know if the six heroes will reunite in time.
Paimon: We talked to Mavuika before we left the Stadium. According to her, the cost of The Captain's plan is too high.
Paimon: And, well, it makes sense... If that was truly the better choice, she would have picked it!
Mualani: Yeah, I trust the Pyro Archon. When I was upset about Kachina's disappearance, she was really sincere and patient with me.
Mualani: Plus, she burned down all those precious mementos for Kachina. She's already proven how much she values even a single person's life.
Mualani: When it comes to Natlan's survival, there's no way she would hold back.
Xilonen: I agree. Maybe The Captain weighed the costs and came to his own conclusion, but I'm sure we have different priorities.
Xilonen: Life is important, but so are history and memory.
Traveler: I'm on Mavuika's side, too.
Paimon: As the Archon, she can't tell us everything, but it seemed like she wasn't holding anything back this time.
Mualani: The next question is... If The Captain found a new way to save Natlan, how come the Pyro Archon has never heard of it?
Kachina: Yeah, and isn't he from Snezhnaya? Why would the Fatui want to save Natlan?
Paimon: Ugh, this is all super confusing...
Xilonen: Hmm...
Xilonen: We still don't have enough information. Once we figure out what the Fatui are doing, we'll have our answer.
Paimon: Let's head back, then. Mavuika said her intelligence officers should return soon.
Paimon: With how many Fatui there are, someone's bound to give something away.
Xilonen: Sounds good. I have a few theories of my own. With a bit more information, we just might get to the bottom of the whole thing.
Kachina: Want to join our garrison, Mualani?
Mualani: I was just about to ask! Count me in!
Mualani: If I was just a bit faster, we could have prevented a few people from getting hurt... people who could help us in the next battle. It's all a chain reaction!
Kachina: Then, you should go register right away! It shouldn't take long. Everyone's looking for people!
Mualani: Register? Nah, I'll just follow you around. Y'know, go where you go, do what you do...
Kachina: U—Um, okay, but then, you have to follow my orders...
Mualani: Hehe, you got it! I just don't wanna make the trip back. It's so far...
Mualani: Alright, see you all later! Let's get together and celebrate once this is over!
Paimon: Oh, you betcha!
Traveler: But, the situation is not looking good.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Mavuika! Oh, Chasca and Chuychu are here... Wait! Are you okay, Chuychu!?
Chuychu: I'm fine, no need to worry...
Mavuika: They ran into the Fatui while out on a mission and decided to follow them.
Paimon: The Fatui!?
Traveler: The Fatui wounded Chuychu?
Chasca: Calm down and let me explain. Here's what happened...

## Talk 9

Chasca: Watch out. It's the Fatui.
Chuychu: Were they attacked by the Abyss? No, wait... It looks like they're protecting a group of travelers. Over there! Do you see?
Chasca: You're right. That's a traveling group from Natlan. Could they be trading for something?
Chasca: Let's keep observing for now.
Baranov: We're glad you're okay. Given the appearance of Abyss monsters all over Natlan, you should cancel your journey and seek shelter at the Stadium or one of the tribes.
Nehsi: Th—Thank you so much... I wish there was something we could give you...
Baranov: We don't expect anything in return. We were out on a mission and saw you being attacked. It was our decision to help.
Baranov: If you truly wish to repay the favor, you can keep this a secret. If anyone asks, just say you were saved by warriors from Natlan.
Nehsi: O—Okay, we can do that.
Tetisheri: But...
Baranov: We're not asking you to cover up our activities. We haven't done anything illegal. Our Captain simply wishes to remain undisturbed.
Baranov: Nonetheless, the decision remains yours. If we wanted to keep you quiet, we would have employed a harsher method.
Tetisheri: G—Got it. We'll get going now...
Chuychu: Did you hear that? They mentioned a "Captain." Isn't that who the Pyro Archon is looking for?
Chasca: Exactly. We could be on to something big.
Chasca: Still, there was no trade. They were just helping people in need... I didn't sense an ulterior motive.
Chasca: I didn't believe The Captain when he said he wanted to save Natlan, but based on what we just saw... It's possible he was telling the truth.
Chuychu: Maybe we've been wrong about the Fatui this whole time...
Chasca: It's too early to say. Let's follow them, and see what's really going on.

## Talk 10

Chuychu: So this is where they were headed. Looks tricky... It's heavily guarded on all sides.
Chasca: Chuychu, wait for me here. I'll go in and check it out.
Chuychu: Oh, no you don't! How are you planning to get through all the guards?
Chasca: Look, I can use this terrain to my advantage. With our tribe's special way of getting around, I doubt they'll see me coming.
Chuychu: We still can't see anything on the inside. What if you can't find cover? You won't have anyone to watch your back if you go in alone!
Chasca: The more heavily guarded the location, the more valuable the secrets. Even if The Captain isn't here, we can still figure out what the Fatui are planning.
Chasca: That intel is worth the risk.
Chuychu: *sigh* Fine. You're not gonna listen to me anyway, so let me come with you.
Chasca: That's even more risky. You've been running around saving people for days. You're already at your limit.
Chasca: I'm confident I can protect myself. I'm not sure you can say the same, at least right now.
Chuychu: I can.
Chasca: *sigh* ...You really believe that?
Chuychu: Fine, don't believe me, but you can't honestly tell me infiltrating a heavily-guarded Fatui hide-out all on your own sounds more reasonable...
Chuychu: Y'know, growing up, even if I insisted on doing something, it never gave you any trouble. I'm not sure you can say the same...
Chasca: Alright, alright, if we start arguing, this will never end. We can't let this opportunity go to waste.
Chuychu: Hehe, guess that means I win. Don't worry, you're not the only capable young person from our tribe. I can handle this.
Chasca: Alright, same plan as usual, we split up, communicate with hand signals, make sure our blind spots are covered, and support each other once we strike.
Chasca: Got your ropes?
Chuychu: Yeah, let's go.
Chasca: (The Fatui have eyes all over this place. I should wait for Chuychu's signal.)
Chasca: (Now!)
Chasca: Go.
Chasca: (Missed my chance. I'll wait for the next one.)
Chasca: (Not sure how many chances I'm gonna get. I need to act.)
Chasca: Jump down.
Chasca: (I've been spotted!)
Chasca: (Good, I made it without getting caught. I should get to that platform over there, but it's guarded by the Fatui.)
Chasca: (Chuychu should have line of sight. I'll wait for her signal.)
Chasca: (That's it. Now's my chance!)
Chasca: Quickly approach the area underneath the platform.
Chuychu: (It's no use staying in one place. I should keep moving.)
Chuychu: (Looks like Chasca is helping me keeping an eye on the Fatui movements. I'll wait for her signal.)
Chuychu: (Time to move.)
Chuychu: Go.
Chuychu: (Phew, that was close! Almost got caught.)
Chuychu: (Probably can't make it over in one go. I'll wait for my next chance.)
Chuychu: (Now's my chance!)
Chuychu: (Haha, I made it! That'll show my sister...)
Chuychu: (Let's see... The Fatui's occupying all the best locations. If we could just get past them somehow... Wait, I've got it!)
Chuychu: Toss out the mysterious sphere.
Golikov: Huh? What's that noise? Did something explode? Ugh, it stinks!
Direi: *coughing* What the heck is that? What do you think you're doing?
Golikov: I could ask you the same thing!
Chuychu: (Good, they're arguing. Looks like they just needed an excuse. They've probably had enough of this job already.)
Chuychu: (The people on the hill over there left to help their comrades. This is our chance!)
Chuychu: (Come get me, Chasca! I hope she gets this hand signal.)
Chasca: (That's Chuychu's signal... Heh, smart idea. Alright, time to move.)
Chasca: Give me your hand, quick!
Chuychu: Coming!
Chuychu: I checked, and this way is completely clear. It should lead us to the deepest part of this place.

## Talk 11

Chuychu: Well? I was pretty helpful, right? You know, everyone usually jumps at the chance to work with me. Not my own sister, though... No, she avoids me like her life depends on it.
Chasca: I was wrong, Chuychu. You've done well.
Chuychu: Wait, you're just gonna admit it? Now I look like the mean one.
Chasca: Let's focus on the task at hand. We're in the heart of enemy territory. The more time we waste, the more dangerous this becomes.
Chuychu: Alright, alright. If you're not gonna take the bait, then I'll drop it.
Chuychu: Looks like the Fatui are here to dig something up. I'm surprised they mobilized this many people... I doubt it's because they're interested in our culture and history.
Chasca: It seems like they're looking for a dragon relic called the "Source Mechanism."
Chasca: The device is ancient. Barely any information survives to this day, and even people from Natlan don't know how to use it... Why would this be the Fatui's target?
Yanovsky: Not bad — looks like it's in good shape. This should be what our lord is looking for.
Yanovsky: Took us long enough. Come on, let's get this thing back.
Chuychu: Back? Back where? Should we keep following?
Chasca: You really want to keep going?
Chuychu: Of course! We make a good team, don't you think? No reason to stop now!
Yanovsky: Hm? What was that sound?
Chasca: Uh-oh, we've been spotted. Time to go!
Chuychu: Falling rock incoming! Watch out for your gadget!
Yanovsky: What!?
Yanovsky: *scoff* You'll regret that... After them!

## Talk 12

Chasca: Once we got them off our tail, we went back to observe some more. They'd collected several identical pieces of something.
Chasca: It looked like they were waiting, though, so we decided to come back.
Xilonen: So... Chuychu got injured trying to get them off your tail?
Chuychu: ...Hehe.
Chasca: She pushed herself too hard and collapsed on the way back to the Stadium.
Chuychu: Well, I didn't cause you any trouble while we were fighting, right? So, my perfect record remains!
Mavuika: You've done very well. I could make a comment on knowing your limits, but it's not my place.
Chuychu: I know, I know... I'm already reflecting on my actions.
Xilonen: So, our current intel suggests the Fatui is after the "Source Mechanism."
Xilonen: The device is a complete mystery, even to us. What does The Captain want with it?
Mavuika: I have no idea, but it's safe to assume the device could serve a similar purpose to the Gnosis.
Mavuika: Xilonen, I need you to gather every scholar in Natlan familiar with the Secret Source.
Xilonen: I'll get right on it.
Mavuika: Thank you both for your hard work... Chuychu, it's time for you to get some rest. Oh, and there are gifts from your patients waiting at the Speaker's Chamber.
Mavuika: I've prepared a small gift of my own as a token of gratitude. I'll send it to your home along with the others.
Chuychu: My patients... That's so nice of them. Hehe, guess that means I'm doing something right.
Chasca: You don't need to give us anything, Archon. We were just doing our duty for Natlan. I should take Chuychu home now...
Mavuika: Haha, well if Chuychu doesn't want her favorite Saurus Crackers, then...
Chuychu: Ah, I accept! Thank you, Archon!
Chasca: *sigh* What am I going to do with you...
Mavuika: There's some for the rest of you as well. They're one of my favorites, too, so don't be shy.
Mavuika: I'll start investigating the Source Mechanism right away. If I learn anything, you'll be the first to know.
Paimon: Hehe, yummy snacks!

## Talk 13

Paimon: What's next for you two?
Chasca: I'm taking Chuychu home. With our parents there to keep an eye on her, I can make sure she actually rests.
Chuychu: Hey, it's not like I'm some kind of prisoner! I'll be fine in a day or two. There's no need to go all the way home.
Chasca: That's what you always say. Everything's "no big deal" until you collapse.
Chasca: What if the Abyss attacks again? You're saying, if I let you rest in a hotel, you're not going to rush out the minute you hear the alarm?
Chuychu: I won't! Triple promise I won't!
Chasca: Mm-hmm.
Chuychu: Fine, on the off-chance something like that were to happen, I might...
Chuychu: But, I'm a doctor. I have a duty to help people in need no matter how hard or tiring the work gets.
Traveler: We need you.
Chuychu: I guess you're right, but I don't have to like it...
Paimon: Hehe, this reminds Paimon of when we first met. Except you were the one trying to stop Chasca from doing something dangerous.
Chuychu: I'd do the same for anyone trying to put their life in danger. As a doctor, I don't want people to get hurt because of a rash decision.
Chasca: Then try to see things from my perspective. You clearly want to protect your patients, so can't you understand why your own sister would feel the same way about you?
Paimon: The two of you are the same, you know.
Chasca: I disagree. I understand the risks and costs of my decisions.
Chuychu: Who wants to be like her? Overconfident, always making excuses when things go wrong...
Chasca: That's just not true.
Chuychu: *scoff* You think I don't have proof?
Paimon: Okay, okay, don't get into another fight! Just pretend Paimon never said anything.
Chasca: Don't worry, Paimon. You didn't do anything wrong. Arguing is just how we communicate — neither of us really takes it to heart.
Chuychu: Plus, I guess we are similar in some ways... Maybe I rush into things without thinking, but I learned that from her.
Chuychu: We're family... I can't help it if my older sister is a bad influence.
Chasca: Okay, you don't have to put it that way...
Paimon: So... you're all good now?
Traveler: This is probably normal for them.
Chasca: Neither of us are the type to back down, so we'll always have our differences. But still, we get along in our own way.
Chuychu: Plus, I know you'll wake up one day and realize I was right all along. I just need to wait.
Chasca: Be my guest. Come on, let's get you home.
Chasca: #See you later, Traveler and Paimon. I'll be back once everything's settled at home.
Paimon: There's no rush! At least grab a nice meal with your family.
Traveler: See you later.
Chuychu: Bye, you two! Take care of yourselves out there!
Traveler: So, you need to look after yourself, too.

## Talk 14

Paimon: Hehe, those two will probably make up for real at some point, right?
Paimon: Well, we've learned a lot. Let's go over everything that we know so far.
Black Screen Text: You and Paimon try to analyze The Captain's goal. You feel like you're just one step away from the answer.
Traveler: (Huh? Footsteps?)
Traveler: Citlali?
Citlali: Ahem! Sorry for popping up out of nowhere again, hehe...
Paimon: Uh, why do you look so awkward? Is there something you need from us?
Citlali: Okay, I won't beat around the bush. Oh, and I'm sorry for interrupting your rest. I'll treat you to some Charcoal Grilled Steak to make up for it.
Paimon: Awesome! Just give us your orders!
Citlali: Hey, friends don't order each other around. I'm just here to share some news. Remember what we talked about before parting ways?
Paimon: Oh, yeah! You mentioned how Ororon has always wanted to save Natlan, and something about his soul being fragmented.
Paimon: #Paimon and Traveler discussed it after you left, and we think Ororon is probably back with The Captain. What do you think?
Citlali: I agree with your hypothesis, and just now... I confirmed it myself.
Citlali: Ororon came back. He helped the Masters of the Night-Wind defend our camp.
Paimon: What? He came back!?
Traveler: Did he say anything?
Citlali: I told him to give up whatever he's doing, but he refused. He said they're just one step away from success, so there's no way he can back out now.
Citlali: Apparently, he came back to fulfill his duty to our tribe. When he left, he said it was because he still has a duty to Natlan as a whole.
Paimon: Paimon's surprised you let him go at all...
Citlali: I had to prioritize my tribe. Besides, the situation was intense. I couldn't focus on outside and inside threats at the same time.
Citlali: Plus, he was on guard. He knew I would try to go after him, so he made sure to keep his distance. I kept an eye out for a good opportunity, but it never came.
Citlali: *sigh* All these years of calling me "granny," and I couldn't do a single thing for him in the end...
Paimon: Don't say that! Your tribe all raised him together, right? That couldn't have been easy.
Citlali: ...
Citlali: You're right. Seeing him come back reminded me of when he was little, running around the tribe, dropping by random houses right and left...
Citlali: He's not only a child of the Masters of the Night-Wind, but a child of Natlan. It's only natural for a child to want to do something for their family.
Citlali: Besides, Ororon is my apprentice. He might have a few tricks up his sleeve, but I guarantee I know every single one.
Paimon: Wait, what are you saying?
Citlali: Look.
Citlali: Remember how I said Ororon's soul is fragmented? This is the talisman I created to keep it stable.
Citlali: And this gem is what makes the talisman work.
Citlali: It just so happens that Ororon is due for a gem replacement. Since I can't get close to him, I put the new gem in a supply bag and asked Ifa to bring it to him.
Citlali: You guys know Ifa, right? No? Well, he's a pretty famous vet around these parts. He's always bringing me all sorts of things, and he happens to be very good friends with Ororon.
Citlali: Ifa doesn't know what's going on, so he agreed no questions asked. Ororon would find the gem as soon as he opened the bag. He knows how important it is, so I knew he would make the switch.
Citlali: He probably suspected that I tampered with it, but here's the catch — the trick is on the bag. The moment he touched it, a portion of his memories were copied onto the old gem, which he no longer needed.
Paimon: That's amazing! You can do something like that?
Citlali: Most people can't, but I can.
Citlali: That trick he used to bring you to the Night Kingdom isn't anything special, by the way. My technique is much more subtle. He won't notice anything.
Paimon: So, in other words, we have a whole backup of Ororon's memories in this gem...
Citlali: Hmph, the kid thinks he can take me on, like I wasn't the one who taught him everything he knows...
Paimon: That's amazing, Citlali! Let's take a look right away!
Citlali: Once we get to the bottom of this, we can finally track him down.
Citlali: ...
Citlali: ...I know he thinks of me as his grandma, but do you think he'll get mad at me for this? You can be honest...
Paimon: Uh, that's a tough question. Paimon doesn't have a grandma, so she's not the best person to ask...
Traveler: ...It's possible. Families disagree sometimes.
Citlali: To be honest... I've always doubted my ability to look after him. I didn't stop the ceremony all those years ago, and now, I'm useless again.
Citlali: But if I stop here, it will haunt me until I'm five hundred years old. Every night, I'll wake up in a fit of anger...
Traveler: And then start crying...
Citlali: Yeah, you're right. First anger, then tears... Wait! Who are you calling a crybaby?
Paimon: #You're just making it worse, Traveler!
Citlali: ...I need to look at his memory. Even if he resents me, refuses to see me, or runs away for good...
Citlali: I don't care, and I won't blame him. A family does whatever it takes to protect their own.
Paimon: You sure you'll be okay? We can come with you if you want!
Citlali: Did you just say... you'll come with me?
Paimon: Is that okay? We have a pretty good reason to see it, too, don't we? Because, uh... Right! We need leads on the Fatui!
Traveler: Paimon's right.
Citlali: You really mean it?
Citlali: Fine, you can come. Just promise me you'll see this through. No backing out, got it?
Paimon: Don't worry! We're professional adventurers.
Citlali: Then, I'll place my trust in your professionalism.
Citlali: Alright, time to sneak into someone else's memory and engage in some, uh... unwanted spying.
Citlali: You heard it here first — I wouldn't be doing this if I had any other choice!
Citlali: ...*exhale* Are you ready?
Traveler: I'm ready.
Traveler: We should be there.
Traveler: And then start freaking out...
Citlali: Hah, I don't scare that easy.
Citlali: Still, if I back away from this and something happens to Ororon, I would never forgive myself.
Traveler: But, as his family, you have to do this.

## Talk 15

Ororon: Look how good you're doing... You'll grow into nice, big radishes in the future.
Ororon: And you... Ifa says you're taking up too much space, but I think you're a good tree. What do you think?
Okanbi: Hey! How's it going, Ororon?
Ororon: Good. How are you, Uncle Okanbi?
Okanbi: Eh, can't complain. Whatcha up to? Naming your vegetables again?
Ororon: No, just some idle conversation.
Okanbi: Hahaha, sounds fascinating. What did they say?
Ororon: They told me you were coming, and that you would take some produce with you.
Okanbi: Hah, only if you're offering!
Okanbi: By the way, I ran into Ifa yesterday. He told me Chasca's fostering a saurian at his place... said the thing trampled over a part of your radish garden. I hope you two didn't get into a huge fight.
Ororon: No, don't worry. I'll find a way for him to make it up to me.
Ororon: I've already wrapped your share of the produce. Here you go.
Okanbi: You really knew I was coming? That's pretty amazing.
Ororon: Light up the smoke, and you can see the path through the shadows. That's what everyone says.
Okanbi: Hey, have you seen that strange group of people that just appeared out of nowhere?
Ororon: Appeared out of nowhere... I don't think so.
Okanbi: It's the Fatui. Their leader seems like a big deal! He didn't bring many men with him, but they're all elite warriors. It seems like they're looking for someone, but I wouldn't go around asking too many questions.
Okanbi: If you run into them, be careful.

## Talk 16

"The Captain": You're from the Masters of the Night-Wind, are you not? Why do you live here alone?
Ororon: ...I enjoy living by myself out in the wild.
Ororon: I guess you're from the Fatui? The one everyone's calling a "big deal"?
"The Captain": Not an inaccurate description.
"The Captain": I'm looking for someone who may be known to you. "Citlali" is her name.
Ororon: (Granny? What does an outlander want with her?)
Ororon: I've heard the name. You have business with her?
"The Captain": ...
"The Captain": There's no point to further questioning if you insist on hiding things from me. I shall seek answers elsewhere.
Ororon: (He could tell I was lying, and now he's leaving? He gave up, just like that?)
Ororon: Hey! At least tell me why you're looking for Citlali.
"The Captain": It's none of your concern. I have my own means of tracking her down.
Ororon: (Why are the Fatui looking for her? What does she have to do with them?)
Ororon: (I can't just let them go like this. I have to figure out what they're planning.)

## Talk 17

"The Captain": ...
Ororon: (They've just been studying the Ley Lines and asking for leads on Granny... I can definitely rule out some sort of invasion.)
"The Captain": The situation has seen no true improvement. The Pyro Archon did not fulfill her promise.
Tarko: My lord!
"The Captain": Hmm?
"The Captain": Ignore him. He is no threat.
Ororon: (He knows I'm following him, but he doesn't seem to care.)
Ororon: (He's strong — I can tell. But there's something... unusual about him and also familiar in some way. I can't describe it.)
Tarko: Uh...
"The Captain": What is it?
Tarko: My lord, I... I feel dizzy...
"The Captain": A Ley Line disturbance. Certain presences have been forced to wander outside their rightful realm.
"The Captain": ...
Ororon: (That was a spell from the Masters of the Night-Wind! How did he know that? Is he... sending those escaped souls back into the Ley Lines?)
Ororon: (How did he do that so easily? Soul ferrying is supposed to be extremely difficult. This could be related to why he's searching for Granny...)
Tarko: Ahh... I feel much better. Thank you, my lord.
"The Captain": Think nothing of it.
"The Captain": Stay vigilant and continue to gather information. The Abyss could attack at any moment. If you notice any irregularities, assume drill formation and be prepared to fight.
"The Captain": However, there is no reason to over-engage. Information is our first priority.
Tarko: Yes, sir!
Ororon: (Why are the Fatui fighting against the Abyss? Do they really mean us no harm?)

## Talk 18

Ororon: (I've been following them this whole time, and still, they ignore me... Do they really not care?)
Ororon: (It seems like his subordinates refer to him as "The Captain." I've never heard of him before.)
Ororon: (And now, he's heading to the Stadium? That's unusual... What is he going to do?)
"The Captain": You two, with me. Everyone else, wait here as instructed. Send word to the other teams to retreat immediately if this fails.
Tarko (Crowd): Yes, sir!
Ororon: (He's going inside? But, the Pyro Archon's in there... What does he want with her?)
Tarko: Forgive me, my lord, allow me to check one more time... Do you truly wish to do this?
"The Captain": The time for idle observation is over. It now falls on me to act.
"The Captain": This nation is out of time.
Tarko: Yes, sir.
Ororon: (He just walked straight into the Stadium. What is he going to do...?)
"The Captain": Hmph...!
Ororon: (They're both incredibly strong. How long will they have to fight until someone comes out on top?)
Ororon: (...!)
Ororon: (Wait, this feeling... just like the other day near the Ley Lines. It's faint, like a soul is trying to escape. Where is it coming from?)
Ororon: (Is that why he's looking for Granny? If he dies here, then all clues will be lost. I can't let that happen!)

## Talk 19

Ororon: ...
"The Captain": As for you... I must confess, I did not expect that little trick of yours to save the day.
Ororon: No matter how dense the fog, as long as the sun remains, we cannot turn day into night. She could have dispelled it — she simply chose not to.
Ororon: You don't have much time, and you're injured on top of that. What do you plan to do next?
"The Captain": I'm beginning to see just how useful you may turn out to be.
"The Captain": You... heard something from here, didn't you?
"The Captain": *cough*
Ororon: No need to force yourself. I've never seen anyone match the Pyro Archon in battle before.
"The Captain": Hm... I didn't expect you to intervene at such a critical moment.
Ororon: You know I've been following you. Why didn't you stop me?
"The Captain": When walking in the forest, it is only natural to encounter wild beasts. However, not every beast has the courage to come out and bite.
Ororon: And yet, one of those very beasts saved your life.
"The Captain": ...
"The Captain": Then speak. What do you want?
Ororon: I didn't save you because I wanted something.
Ororon: My soul is more perceptive than others. I can sense that the Ley Lines are extremely weak. I don't know what the Pyro Archon is planning. Can she really save us?
Ororon: The questions you asked her just now... Well, I've had very similar doubts. So, I felt like I had to help you.
"The Captain": ...Ah.
"The Captain": So, you can tell the truth. That was quite a reckless decision to make. I'm not sure you realize that.
Ororon: There's no turning back for me now. What I did back there is going to get me in a lot of trouble.
Ororon: You attacked the Pyro Archon in broad daylight, and I used my spell to save you. A single glance was likely all it took for her to recognize my tribe.
Ororon: So, we're in the same boat.
"The Captain": You seem to care little for my thoughts on the matter.
Ororon: It's too late for that. Start from the beginning — why are you looking for Citlali? Do you know her?
"The Captain": Explain your relation to her first. I know you two are acquainted. It was obvious the moment I mentioned her name.
Ororon: Citlali is my elder and my teacher. She taught me everything I know. It's my duty to protect her.
"The Captain": If you truly wish to protect her, you should have let me perish at the Pyro Archon's hand. Yet, you chose otherwise... Do I really need to tell you what that means?
Ororon: ...
Ororon: I want to do something to change Natlan for the better, something that I can accomplish with my own two hands. You're stranger than anyone I've ever met, but maybe... just maybe, you can show me the way.
"The Captain": Strange...? Hmph.
"The Captain": Citlali... is said to be the legendary Granny Itztli, someone capable of communicating with the Wayob, and the Wayob are the key to information on the Night Kingdom.
Ororon: Why do you need knowledge on the Night Kingdom?
"The Captain": That is not something you need to know.
Ororon: Don't forget — I saved your life.
"The Captain": Do you not believe the Fatui capable of betraying a debt?
Ororon: People can lie, but souls cannot. I can tell there's a weight to your soul, a sense of justice.
"The Captain": You may not live among your tribe, but you certainly know their tricks. I apologize for my rash judgment... You are more capable than I imagined.
"The Captain": Let's go. We'll see if you have what it takes to join my plan.

## Talk 20

"The Captain": I see. Interesting approach.
Ororon: Worth trying, I think.
"The Captain": Rather than weaving a net to protect the Ley Lines, this method would address the root problem...
"The Captain": By reconstructing the Ley Lines themselves.

## Talk 21

Traveler: !!!
Paimon: Whoa!
Citlali: #Traveler, Paimon! Are you two alright?
Paimon: Paimon's fine! Just, um, a little dizzy...
Traveler: I'm fine.
Traveler: Are you okay, Citlali?
Citlali: Of course.
Citlali: I'm just... I'm so mad at him!
Citlali: *scoff* After everything, he still can't let go of the past.
Traveler: I can kind of understand how he feels.
Citlali: For some reason, he thinks he owes something to the people who cared for him... Heh, stubborn, self-righteous fool! Where's that gonna get him?
Citlali: Now that he's all grown up, he thinks no one can tell him what to do!? He thinks he can just run away whenever he wants!
Citlali: I'll show him... If he tries to run one more time, he's got another thing coming!
Paimon: Maybe stubbornness runs in the family. Like grandmother, like grandson, as they say...
Citlali: Is that supposed to be a compliment? Hmph, that kid's got nothing on me.
Citlali: Anyway, back to what we just saw. I don't even know what to make of it...
Paimon: Yeah! The Captain seriously wants to... reconstruct the Ley Lines?
Paimon: What does that even mean? Something like the Loom of Fate, maybe? But, how does that help with the Abyss?
Citlali: "The Loom of Fate"?
Paimon: Oh, uh... It's kind of hard to explain. Basically, it's a device from Khaenri'ah that has unbelievable power.
Paimon: Anyway, if he really wants to manipulate the Ley Lines, everyone in Natlan will be affected. This is big...
Traveler: He's serious. It lines up with everything he's said before.
Citlali: Which means, The Captain has been honest from the very beginning. Ororon's memory proves that.
Paimon: Why is he so obsessed with saving Natlan? We've got to tell Mavuika about this right away!
Citlali: Yes, she needs to know about this now.
Traveler: Okay, let's go!
Traveler: He tried to seize the Gnosis for the same purpose.
