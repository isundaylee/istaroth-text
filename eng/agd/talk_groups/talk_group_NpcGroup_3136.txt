Traveler: Why did you come to Watatsumi Island?
Nishikino Reirei: While working as a traveling doctor, I happened to save one of the Sangonomiya troops out in the wild, and heard about the situation here.
Nishikino Reirei: That they've managed to last this long without sufficient manpower or material... Should I call them determined, or overly eager to go it alone...
Nishikino Reirei: Well, now that I'm here, things have turned around a decent bit. These soldiers should get well... as long as they follow my advice instead of running around arbitrarily.
Nishikino Reirei: I just wish that the kids around here would be a bit less rowdy, and stop coming to me crying about broken arms and legs... I've got no time to entertain those little brats.
