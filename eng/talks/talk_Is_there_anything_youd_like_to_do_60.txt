# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Shenhe: As a matter of fact, I would like something to eat.
Traveler: Oh, you're hungry?
Shenhe: Well, no. Not really. I actually just wanted to sit and chat with you over a long meal.
Shenhe: I heard that sharing a meal is really important to the people of Liyue.
Shenhe: It's not only about eating, but rather, "sharing an enjoyable time with those that are important to you."
Shenhe: When everyone gathers together over a meal, that's called a "get-together," right?
Traveler: That's right, especially during the holidays.
Shenhe: Like Lantern Rite? I know that everyone is supposed to release Xiao Lanterns during that holiday... a pity that it's only once a year.
Traveler: There are other holidays, too, you know...
Shenhe: I see...
Shenhe: I used to always feel that the holidays had nothing to do with me. But now... there seems to be a longing in my heart for the next holiday to come more quickly.
Shenhe: I would like to use all that I have learned to celebrate together with you.
Traveler: I almost didn't realize it, but...
Shenhe: I've been growing thanks to your constant guidance. Believe me, I won't forget your kindness.
Shenhe: And my feelings toward you are not only of gratitude...
Shenhe: But anyway, let's celebrate the next holiday together!
Traveler: We'll have a get-together?
Shenhe: Yes, a big get-together.
Traveler: You've made loads of progress...
Traveler: For example, the Moonchase Festival. Everyone gathers to enjoy the moonlight together.
