Cyno: Do you have time for a duel?
Traveler: I'm sorry, I don't know how to play.
Cyno: Huh, really... I suppose you've been too busy with other things to pick up the game?
Cyno: I'd suggest you visit The Cat's Tail. There's a teacher there who's quite proficient with introducing beginners to the game. You can learn the basics from her.
Cyno: The sooner you learn, the sooner we can duel.
