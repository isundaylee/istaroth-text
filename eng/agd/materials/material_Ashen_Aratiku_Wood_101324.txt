# Ashen Aratiku Wood

Timber obtained from Ashen Aratiku Trees. Other than being lighter, it isn't all that different from most regional trees in Natlan. Mature Saurian companions can carry it with ease, and some legends even tell of tribal warriors who use bundles of such timber as fitness gear.
Can be used to create furnishings.
