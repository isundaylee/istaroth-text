Matsumae: It's a win! Ayaka and the Traveler won! Oh, this exhibition match was so exciting and thrilling that I was on the edge of my seat.
Sae: Well, you were asleep the last couple of matches with me. But this exhibition match was really good, and it even got a layman like you excited.
Matsumae: That guy's passion and enthusiasm in pursuing swordsmanship is so cool! Is it too late to learn swordsmanship now...
Sae: It's never too late to start. As long as there is the motivation to learn, coupled with the determination to persevere, I'm sure you'll accomplish something. You might not become famous, but you could become a skilled swordsman!
Sae: But you're not in shape, and it's hard to pass the entrance exam for the schools of swordsmanship. Why don't you go on runs with me every day? Not only is it good exercise, you can quickly adapt when taking part in morning trainings in future!
Matsumae: ... Well, perhaps it's best that I give up on this idea.
