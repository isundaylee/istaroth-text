# Cake for Traveler

A souvenir left over from a very special day.

Here's to you, the brightest star in the night sky.
Wishing you a joyous journey in this great big world.

"This must be the first time we've celebrated this special day. Every week, we update the recommended dishes, every month, the moon will send down new blessings, but wow, it's almost nine thousand hours to go before we celebrate this day again!"
