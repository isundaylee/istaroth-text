Traveler: A fugitive?
Antila: Well, the case went like this...
Antila: The "Monsieur" tripped a thief who had stolen a wallet with a crowbar.
Antila: The wallet contained a picture taken by the owner of the wallet, and in the background of that photo was a criminal on the run.
Antila: ...And yeah, that's how evidence fell from the skies, enabling the Maison Gardiennage to catch a fugitive.
Antila: The culprit has already been locked away in the Fortress of Meropide â€” hardly a convenient interview subject. As such, there's really no opportunity to dig any deeper.
Antila: I know that Houallet knows this as well, but he just doesn't want Charlotte to score the monthly reprint slots with her stories again.
