Gretchen: Yes, please feel free to rest up here for a bit.

Traveler: Huh? Isn't that just making me cook?
Gretchen: Whaaat? How did you figure it out so quickly?
Gretchen: Hehe, I wanted to become a chef, I just really don't have any talent for cooking... No matter how hard I work on the interior, a restaurant needs to have food.
