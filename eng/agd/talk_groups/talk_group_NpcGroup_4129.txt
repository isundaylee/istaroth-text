## Talk

Parisa: If you ask me, everyone should watch a show at Zubayr Theater!

## Talk

Traveler: About the Zubayr Theater...
Parisa: In the Grand Bazaar of Sumeru City, there is Zubayr Theater, full of song and dance.
Parisa: The manager Sheikh Zubayr is a real genius! He knows playwriting and choreography, and even makes props. He excels in everything!
Parisa: The beautiful dancer Nilou performs even better than ever with the choreography of Sheikh Zubayr.
Parisa: You may consider yourself lucky if you ever get to see her dance at the Sabzeruz Festival!

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about yourself...
Parisa: I'm just the most ordinary traveling scholar at the Akademiya. I'm nobody.
Parisa: If I had a gift for art, I probably wouldn't have gone to the Akademiya. Just a joke, haha.
Parisa: There seems to be very few people at the Akademiya who have a thing for singing and dancing. Perhaps research and papers take up most of their time.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Parisa: Goodbye. Make sure you see Nilou's dance performance at Grand Bazaar!

## Talk

Traveler: About the Sabzeruz Festival...
Parisa: Sabzeruz Festival is the festival celebrating the birthday of Sumeru's deity — the Dendro Archon.
Parisa: After Greater Lord Rukkhadevata passed away, Sabzeruz Festival was moved to the birthday of Lesser Lord Kusanali. Unfortunately, the festival lost some of its former glory in the process...
Parisa: The Akademiya no longer hosts the festival, and we practically have little chance to see the Dance of Sabzeruz.
Parisa: What a pity...

## Talk

Traveler: About the Sabzeruz Festival...
Parisa: The Sabzeruz Festival is the festival celebrating the birthday of Sumeru's deity — the Dendro Archon.
Parisa: It is said that in the ancient past, the Goddess of Flowers would dance at the Dendro Archon's birthday, and the Padisarahs would bloom across the stage...
Parisa: Thus, we call the Dendro Archon's birthday celebration the "Sabzeruz Festival."

## Talk

Traveler: Studying is important.
Parisa: True. With knowledge, you can live a better life.
Parisa: But we shouldn't be rigid in our studies. Only with a flexible mind can we unravel greater mysteries.
