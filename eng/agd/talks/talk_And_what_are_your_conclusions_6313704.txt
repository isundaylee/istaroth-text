Traveler: And what are your conclusions?
Kaushik: My conclusion is that ancient Inazuma must have played host to two snake gods!
Kaushik: One of them was enjoined with coral and could not move, thus creating Sangonomiya Shrine. Its true divine form dwelled within Enkanomiya deep below, forever defending the people of Watatsumi Island.
Kaushik: As for the other snake god, it was a most ambitious being that dreamed of invading Narukami Island, but was cut down by the Electro Archon as it was making its way there.
Kaushik: See? This totem shows snake patterns with coral on them on one end, and patterns that completely lack them on the other. And that's how you know this is the truth!
Kaushik: Very reasonable, is it not? Once I publish my conclusions, I'll be famous! Hahaha!
