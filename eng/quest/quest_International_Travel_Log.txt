# International Travel Log


## Talk 1

Kozue: Welcome to the Komore Teahouse! How can I help you?
Traveler: About Ramsay...
Kozue: Oh that businessman... He is indeed in the teahouse. But he's been quite stressed recently. Not sure what happened...
Kozue: If you want to find him, just go inside and you'll see him.

## Talk 2

Ramsay: Are you... a traveler? What can I do for you?
Traveler: About the travelogue...
Ramsay: Oh, you mean the travelogue I wrote for that little girl Midori.
Ramsay: I've been too busy to write those lately. She must be getting anxious...
Traveler: Are those travelogues real?
Ramsay: Hahaha, what do you think?
Traveler: They don't sound real to me...
Ramsay: Hahaha, I can see you are well-traveled. You can tell right away.
Ramsay: That's right. Technically, none of the facts in the travelogues are real.
Ramsay: Although some places and characters are based on reality... Most of the contents are my own imagination.
Ramsay: Of course, some of it is not entirely imaginary. For example, in the travelogue that I'm writing, someone made a super balloon.
Ramsay: Then he summoned his friends and planned to travel around Teyvat in this balloon in 80 days.
Ramsay: Also, this balloon does not require a Vision to operate. All it takes is some technical knowledge.
Ramsay: These people travel around the world in the balloon, and they encounter various strange things and phenomena along the way...
Ramsay: I was going to write this for Midori. But for some reason, I didn't even have time to finish a short paragraph.
Traveler: Why is that?
Ramsay: Do you see that guy in the hallway? He's called Heihachi. He's been staring at me since I don't know when.
Ramsay: I was going out to look for inspiration for my travelogue. But that guy has been following me everywhere. I don't know what he's trying to do.
Ramsay: I'm worried that this guy has ill intentions towards me. I wouldn't dare to go out. That's why the travelogue has been delayed.
Ramsay: Fortunately, now you are here. Traveler, can you accompany me to look for inspiration outside? With you here, I don't think he would dare to do anything to me.
Traveler: I'll take care of it.
Ramsay: Thank you.
Ramsay: As the saying goes, "one must guard against others." Someone's staring at me from behind. I have to guard against him no matter what.
Ramsay: So when I'm looking for inspiration, please protect me, traveler.
Ramsay: In fact, I already have a few locations in mind. Let's go there right now.
Ramsay: The first place is near the beach. Let's go.
Traveler: Why would he do that?
Ramsay: I don't know. But... People don't need a reason to be malicious to someone.
Traveler: I hope it's true.
Ramsay: Hahaha, I also wish the things I wrote could come true.

## Talk 3

Ramsay: The water at this beach is crystal clear, and the color of the sand is so white, it's completely different from the open seas.
Ramsay: It would be a nice place to set sail from... or take off from...
Ramsay: Ehm, the scenery here is very nice. Let me write it down in my notes.
Ramsay: Traveler, please wait a moment. I need to think about how to write my travelogue. You can walk around and enjoy the scenery.
Ramsay: But please don't stray too far away from me. The guy Heihachi is following me. He's just nearby.

## Talk 4

Ramsay: The water at this beach is crystal clear, and the color of the sand is so white, it's completely different from the open seas.
Ramsay: This could be a safe place to set sail from...

## Talk 5

Heihachi: Why are you standing in my way? Are you trying to start something?
Traveler: Why are you following us?
Heihachi: Following you? What? I'm just taking a walk around here! What's wrong with that? Do you own this beach? Who do you think you are...

## Talk 6

Ramsay: Pretty good! The scenery here is really nice...
Ramsay: And then... Let me have a look. There is a river bend in the outskirts to the north of town. The small waterfall there is very nice. Let's go there.

## Talk 7

Ramsay: Please take these paragraphs of travelogue to Midori. When I finish the whole story, I'll ask someone to bring her the completed travelogue.
Heihachi: Humph, there must be some sort of agenda behind it... Just that he hasn't exposed himself yet.

## Talk 8

Ramsay: Why are there monsters wandering around... Although the scenery is very nice, it really is quite dangerous...
Ramsay: But I can include this experience in my travelogue...
Ramsay: Let's get out of here and find a safe place.
Ramsay: That guy is still following us. He's really... humph... persistent...

## Talk 9

Heihachi: What the hell is this place? There are monsters here...
Traveler: Why are you following us?
Heihachi: Me... follow you? Aren't I allowed to come here to enjoy a walk and pick fruit? So paranoid...

## Talk 10

Ramsay: Standing on the top of the mountain, you can almost see the entire Narukami Island.
Ramsay: The wind at the mountain top is quite strong, and the height is perfect for take-off. There are no obstacles here.
Ramsay: And it's a long way from Inazuma City, I won't be disturbed by Doushin... or by unwanted people.
Traveler: It really is a good location.
Ramsay: In conclusion, it's a good location to take off from... And it's a nice place to write about in the travelogue.
Ramsay: That guy... he's still following us. He just won't let us go.
Traveler: I'll get rid of him.
Ramsay: It's fine. Don't worry about him. He wouldn't dare do anything rash with you around.
Ramsay: When dealing with this kind of person... If you approach him, he would keep pestering you.
Ramsay: Anyway, let's call it a day. Let's go back to the Komore Teahouse.

## Talk 11

Ramsay: I already have some ideas about the main story of my travelogue. But it'll take me a day or two to finish the chapter.
Ramsay: I wrote a few paragraphs before. Please take these paragraphs to Midori first.
Ramsay: When I am finished with the whole story, I'll ask someone to bring her the completed travelogue.
Heihachi: Travelogue... Humph. That's what he says. How would I know if he has any other agendas...
Traveler: What are you talking about?
Heihachi: I said this guy has ulterior motives for writing these travelogues.
Heihachi: Who would think about such random nonsense? Traveling around Teyvat in a hot-air balloon without using a Vision...
Heihachi: Humph, there must be some sort of agenda behind it... he just hasn't exposed himself yet.

## Talk 12

Midori: Traveler, did you get the Travelogue?
Traveler: This is from Mr. Ramsay...
Midori: Travel around Teyvat in Eighty Days... WOW! Thank you! Let me have a look...
Midori: Oh, how come this is so thin? The other travelogues are much thicker...
Traveler: He hasn't finished yet.
Midori: Is that so? I'll wait and read it when Uncle Ramsay is finished... Then I'll have a new story to tell Kouichi.
Midori: Thank you, Traveler. These are for you. Please accept them.
