Pengyi: Oh, it's you! Thanks so much for your help previously.
Pengyi: Are you here to try your hand at making some fireworks?
Traveler: What sorts of fireworks can I make?
Pengyi: Oh, lots and lots! I could be here all day and not finish talking about them. That said, I've written some basic formulas down for you.
Pengyi: Go ahead, have a gander at them!
Pengyi: I have faith that you'll be able to make some lovely fireworks!
Traveler: See you.
Pengyi: Ah, you must be busy with other things, I suppose? In that case, pop by again when you're free â€” but don't go through this Lantern Rite without making a few fireworks, you hear?
