Traveler: Why do you pay by the hour?
Duqin: Oh! Because it's our part-time job!
Duqin: Our primary job is to assist the guys in the Secure Transport Agencies with the unpacking and distribution of long-distance shipments.
Duqin: However, there aren't that many such long-distance shipments. Since we have nothing else to do between them, why not do some odd jobs and help some foreign visitors?
Duqin: Everyone knows when the next long-distance shipment will be arriving, so our work schedule is quite flexible if we only accept a few hours of work at any one time.
