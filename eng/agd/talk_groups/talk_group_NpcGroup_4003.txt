Traveler: Are you alright?
Maddah: I just drank the manager's— I mean, the acting manager's coffee that she brought over. I feel fine physically, but my mental state is troubling.
Maddah: Everyone clearly liked my hero stories at first, so why are they rarely coming to hear them now?
Maddah: Have sophisticated, mighty heroes already fallen out of fashion?

Traveler: I don't think that's the problem...
Maddah: Really? Then why does everyone leave before the story even gets going?
Maddah: Some guests from afar have even said that the stories aren't as fresh as those from Liyue about gods descending to the battlefield or maid-knights fighting against giant mechanical beasts and the like...
Maddah: But those stories sound simply outrageous! I find it really hard to accept a story that can't immerse listeners with a sense of realism.
