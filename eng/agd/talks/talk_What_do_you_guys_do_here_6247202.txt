Traveler: What do you guys do here?
Fangju: The registration of people and goods entering and exiting, the inspection and, if needed, the quarantine of the above, applications for delivery within Liyue's borders, and ad-hoc goods storage â€” those are our four main tasks.
Fangju: Usually, outlanders who wish to do business in Liyue and who arrive at Yilong Wharf will come here to register their personal information.
Fangju: Our staff will then inspect and disinfect their goods.
Fangju: If you wish to transport goods to other locations within Liyue's borders, this is where you register.
Fangju: We will also evaluate the total quantity of goods and distances to destinations, and the manifests will be sent to transport units or our partners at the Secure Transport Agency, after which said secondary departments will do the actual transportation.
Fangju: If you have not yet planned a final delivery destination, you can also register here to have them stored temporarily in one of our warehouses.
Fangju: Of course, all this assumes you already have a formal business permit. If you need one, we can also serve as a proxy to help you apply for it.
Fangju: Of course, that would be a bit less efficient than doing it in Liyue Harbor.
