# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Go look for some reference books first.
Paimon: Well... theory is the safest way to get started.
Paimon: The Knights of Favonius' library has a large collection of books. You should be able to find something there, right?
Paimon: Liyue and Inazuma also have knowledge on arranging flowers. If you get the chance, you can also try to get some books written there for reference.
Pauline: I understand. I'll ask someone to help me get some books from the library once Weinlesefest ends.
Pauline: As for reference books from Liyue and Inazuma, I should be able to ask Mats. He travels a lot.
Paimon: Hehe, maybe the next time we meet, you'll have become a master at arranging flowers!
Pauline: I'll do my best. Your suggestions are really valuable. Thank you very much!
Pauline: Here is a token of my gratitude. Please take it!
