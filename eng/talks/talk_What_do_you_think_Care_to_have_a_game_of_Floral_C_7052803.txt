Plauen: What do you think? Care to have a game of Floral Chess?
Traveler: I'll give it a go.
Traveler: Tell me a bit more about Floral Chess.
Plauen: The adventurer who designed this game said that his inspiration came from the billowing petals and the wind that pursues them...
Plauen: And the game is meant to imitate the... romanticism of pursuing these flower petals...
Plauen: From a player's perspective, though, I'd say it's more like being chased around by some balloons with flower petals and paper strips stuffed in them...
Plauen: The experience isn't bad, don't get me wrong, but where's the romanticism...?
Traveler: See you around.
Plauen: Yeah, see you. If you wanna give this a try, just come over and give me a shout.
