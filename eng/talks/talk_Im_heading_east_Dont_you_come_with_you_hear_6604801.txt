Kane: I'm heading east. Don't you come with, you hear?
Kanaloa: Hehe, I had no idea you were so worried about me. Funnily enough, I worry about you too â€” that once you're out there in the east, you'll end up getting yourself trapped down some dead end.
Kane: And you're just gonna follow me right into it? Sounds like a great plan.
Kanaloa: Whatever, you think I actually buy your story? I'm telling you, I'm about to head west. What are the chances that we'll end up bumping into each other over there, huh?
Kane: ...Ugh, you're so annoying. Why do you have to make a simple treasure hunt so complicated... Can't we just work together for once?
Kane: If we end up fighting like we did last time, our kid brother's gonna go looking for Chasca again.
Kanaloa: Hmm, when you put it like that, I guess we would be better off working together...
Kanaloa: It would be kind of embarrassing if we had to get The Peacemaker involved for something so small.
