Traveler: What are you doing?
Yamada: I am drawing fortune slips. I wish that the Almighty Shogun will change her mind and lift the Sakoku Decree soon...
Yamada: But I have already drawn slips several times. They either read "Misfortune" or "Great Misfortune"! Alas, what an awful day!
Yamada: Because of the restrictions of the Sakoku Decree, I can no longer sail out for business. The goods I have now are all stuck.
Yamada: Business has not been smooth at all, and even the Grand Narukami Shrine can't save me... Is it because my luck can't get better after I witnessed that event?
Yamada: No, no way! I can't give up now! No matter how many times it takes, I will get a good slip before I leave!
