# Missing title (1302984159)


## Talk 1

Uturunku: Do you get... scared?

## Talk 2

Tepoz: Traveler, can I ask you a favor?
Tepoz: My mother's a doctor. When she heard about the attacks in the wilderness, she rushed out to help, and I haven't heard from her since.
Tepoz: I'm worried. She's not a fighter, and I can't leave to check on her. I want her to stay out of this, so if you see her, can you please tell her to take shelter?
Paimon: Of course! We've got this!
Tepoz: Thank you. That makes it easier to focus on the current battle.

## Talk 3

Traveler: It's normal to be afraid.
Uturunku: Normal? You mean... I'm not being a coward?
Paimon: Not at all! You're here, aren't you? Ready to fight even despite your fear! That's impressive!
Uturunku: Oh... Yâ€”Yeah! You're right! Thanks, you two.

## Talk 4

Traveler: Not really.
Uturunku: I... I knew it. You're too strong for that...
Uturunku: *sigh*...

## Talk 5

Mayahuel: Thank you. *sigh* They really came out of nowhere...
Guaman: Yeah, that was close. Thank you for coming all this way to help us, Doctor.
Mayahuel: Just doing my part.

## Talk 6

Traveler: Absolutely.
Uturunku: That's what I'm hoping for, too, it's just... Never mind.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Doctor... Wait, do you know Tepoz?
Mayahuel: He's my son... Why? Did something happen to him?
Paimon: No, no! He's fine! He's just worried about you. He asked us to tell you to seek shelter.
Mayahuel: Ah, I see. I know it's dangerous to be out and about like this, but I just can't sit back and do nothing...
Mayahuel: How about this... I'll write to him and promise to team up with the next group of warriors I come across. I'll be safer that way.
Paimon: Sounds good! Paimon's sure he'll be relieved you're okay.
Mayahuel: Thank you for passing along his message.

## Talk 8

Raman: Uh... Ugh...
Paimon: Someone's injured... That must be the messenger! Hey, are you alright? Can you still walk?
Raman: The battle report, I have to find the battle report...
Traveler: We already found it.
Paimon: Yeah, we got you covered! Here you go.
Raman: Oh, thank you... *sigh* I just hope I'm not too late...
Raman: In times like these, every second counts. Even a short delay can put lives at risk...
Paimon: Don't worry about that! We can take things from here. You just need to head back to the Stadium and focus on getting better.
Traveler: Have faith in your people.
Raman: ...You're right. I can't do much else in my current state anyway.
Paimon: How can we make sure he'll safely get back, though? We can't let him make the journey alone, it's too dangerous out there...
Brave Yumkasaur: Roar... roar, roar...
Raman: Huh? What the...
Traveler: Looks like this yumkasaur wants to give you a lift.
Paimon: Whoa... you guys sure about this? It's really dangerous out there...
Brave Yumkasaur: Roar, roar...
Raman: Alright, well... Thanks, this is a huge help.
Traveler: Be careful on the road.
Paimon: Thank goodness for those saurians. They really came to the rescue.
Traveler: Yeah. He stands a much better chance of survival now.
Paimon: It's no wonder people from Natlan are so fond of their saurian companions.
Traveler: Turns out they could understand what you were saying this whole time.
Paimon: Really, that's your takeaway from this? Unbelievable...

## Talk 9

Stadukhin: The Captain must have known the situation would get a lot more dire than expected. That would explain why he was so anxious.

## Talk 10

Chimalli: Ah, by the way... I think I know where some monsters might be. It's an area nearby.
Chimalli: If you've got some time, I'd appreciate the back-up.
Traveler: Of course.
Chimalli: Alright, let's move out.
Traveler: Sorry, I have something else to do.
Chimalli: Don't worry about it. I'll round up a few warriors to go with me.

## Talk 11

Chimalli: Thanks to you, we managed to clear out the threats in the surrounding area. Let's head back.

## Talk 12

Awhina: I want to seek shelter as well, but the People of the Springs need these potions. I have to get them there.

## Talk 13

Mayahuel: It really is getting dangerous out here. Looks like sticking with a group of warriors is the only way to stay safe...
Mayahuel: Anyway, I should head out. Other places need my attention.
Paimon: She seems quite anxious... Guess that means things aren't looking good...

## Talk 14

Traveler: The Fatui could escort you?
Awhina: Uh... I'm not sure about that.
Stadukhin: We can get you close. It's on our way.
Awhina: Oh, well... Great! I appreciate it!

## Talk 15

Traveler: I wouldn't risk it.
Awhina: You're right. It's dangerous out here. I don't even know if I'd make it...
Awhina: Other caravans are already there, so it should be fine.

## Talk 16

Kamaka: How long are these attacks going to last...
Kamaka: I was heading to the People of the Springs for business, but looks like I can kiss that Mora goodbye. At least I'm still in one piece.
Paimon: Did something happen on the road?
Kamaka: I was attacked by monsters. I really thought it was over, but would you believe it... the Fatui saved my life.
Kamaka: The Captain's soldiers running around Natlan rescuing people... I almost couldn't believe it. I guess the Abyss really is our common enemy.
Kamaka: They set out again after rescuing us. I hope they'll be okay out there.

## Talk 17

Kamaka: Hey, you two! We made it back in one piece!
Kamaka: Honestly, it's all thanks to you.
Kamaka: The Fatui that helped us are still fighting out there. I hope they're okay.

## Talk 18

Mayahuel: Oh, I didn't expect to see you here.
Mayahuel: My son wrote back to me and said things are under control on his end. That's one less thing to worry about for now.
Mayahuel: I heard medical personnel were needed at the Stadium, so I followed a group of warriors back here.
Mayahuel: My age means I can't charge to the frontlines, but I can handle things here. Everything will get better.

## Talk 19

Awhina: I've decided to bring these supplies to the Stadium, but this amount won't nearly be enough. There's a shortage pretty much everywhere.
Awhina: We have emergency stockpiles of things like water, food, and medicine, but what if we'll need them even more in the future...?
Awhina: Guess I'll just have to talk to my guild, and see if they've got any more to spare.

## Talk 20

Mayahuel: Oh, it's you two! Perfect timing! I heard you saved this lady, too.
Awhina: That's right! They rescued my potion shipment.
Mayahuel: Wonderful, these potions are just what I needed to treat my patients. I'll make sure you're well rewarded for the trouble.
Awhina: Don't worry about it. The regular price is more than enough. Time is the most precious thing right now.
Mayahuel: Thank you so much! Let's head out soon.
Awhina: Sounds good.

## Talk 21

Uturunku: I've managed to accept my fear, but I still want to ask you one last thing... If I die, do you think anyone will remember me?

## Talk 22

Traveler: Don't think about that. Do your best to stay alive.
Paimon: Yeah! Please do whatever you can to stay alive! Your life is super important!
Uturunku: My life... is super important...
Uturunku: ...Got it. Thank you again for leading me to the answer.

## Talk 23

Mayahuel: Oh, I didn't expect to see you here.
Mayahuel: I heard medical personnel were needed at the Stadium, so I followed a group of warriors back here.
Mayahuel: My age means I can't charge to the frontlines, but I can handle things here. Everything will get better.
