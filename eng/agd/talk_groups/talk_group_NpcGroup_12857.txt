Kautilya: Who are you!?
Kautilya: Oh, it's just you... Iâ€”I mean, if it isn't the tournament favorites!
Kautilya: What are you here for? I hope it's feedback on your Wisdom Orbs. Having any issues?
Paimon: Geez, no need to be so impatient...
Kautilya: Hey! Take that back. I'm very busy, okay? If you can't provide any useful feedback, then run along and focus on the competition!
Kautilya: I'm busy gathering data to advance the efficiency and functionality of the Wisdom Orb!
Traveler: What a grouch...
Paimon: Well, maybe we don't have the time to talk to you either, hmph! Next time you want feedback, go climb a random hill somewhere and talk to some mushrooms!
