Hanquan: How dare a grade seven nobody speak and act so arrogantly...

## Talk

Traveler: Grade seven pawn?
Hanquan: Martial artists are divided into nine grades. One's the highest, nine the lowest.
Hanquan: Now, I was escorting someone from Yanshang Teahouse to Qiaoying Village two days ago, when I ran into this... mouthy pest!
Hanquan: I couldn't stop myself from exchanging a few pointers with him, but what do you know, he was just a worthless grade seven.
Hanquan: In the end, the strong keep it on the down low. I don't know why those clowns are so fond of acting out.

Traveler: Goodbye.
Hanquan: Farewell.

## Talk

Traveler: And just who is doing the ranking?
Hanquan: Me, of course. I've seen many martial artists in my time, so I've got confidence in my judgment.
Hanquan: Let me put it this way. There's an excellent martial artist named Huangshan who can be found on the trade routes linking Liyue and Mondstadt. She's barely a grade three.
Hanquan: Sun Yu, a Guhua Disciple, wields a swift and sharp sword, and he'd be a grade two.
Hanquan: A grade one, then, has to be an absolute master.
Hanquan: In my opinion, Branch Master Lan of the Adventurers' Guild would count.

## Talk

Traveler: What grade are you?
Hanquan: As for me, my skill is still lacking. You can consider me a grade three.

## Talk

Traveler: What grade is Yelan?
Hanquan: Huh. How did you know our boss' name?
Hanquan: As far as I know, she's gentle, refined, and capable of resolving problems with just a few words. I've never seen her fight anyone.
Hanquan: But can you really rate those who never fight? Would they even reach grade nine? Hmm...

## Talk

Traveler: What grade am I?
Hanquan: If I'm being honest, I've never heard of you...
Hanquan: But based on your bright gaze and long breaths, you must be a grade two at least.

## Talk

Traveler: At a bare minimum, I'm the highest grade!
Hanquan: You really don't hold back, huh?
Hanquan: I'd hope to see a few of your moves one day, should fate permit.
