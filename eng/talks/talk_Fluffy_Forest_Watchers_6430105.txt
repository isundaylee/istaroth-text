Traveler: Fluffy... Forest Watchers?
Amir: Haha, I think you've misunderstood. I didn't mean my colleagues, I meant these doggies.
Amir: They may seem like they're all over the place, but they're actually very reliable. They're good friends and assistants for our forest patrol work.
Amir: As for myself, I am responsible for managing and training these search and rescue dogs.
Amir: Sag is my best student, so I appointed it captain of the search and rescue dog team. If you can't find a Forest Watcher or a Forest Ranger, you can ask it for help too.
