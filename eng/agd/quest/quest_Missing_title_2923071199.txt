# Missing title (2923071199)


## Talk 1

Paimon: Wow, that's a really long letter. Seems like Zhiqiong left it here!
Traveler: It's hers alright...
Paimon: Ugh, where's she gone!? Let's go tell Jinwu what happened first.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Jinwu, we found this!
Jinwu: Alright, alright, relax. What did you find? Does it have anything to do with Zhiqiong's whereabouts?
Traveler: It's a letter she left behind. She says she's gone deeper into The Chasm.
Jinwu: Thank you. Let me see what she's written real quick.
Black Screen Text: Jinwu reads the letter carefully.
Jinwu: This girl... I've never really considered issues this big, so I can't really criticize her life choices. But perhaps...
Jinwu: Perhaps I didn't acknowledge her discoveries in time, or give her as much respect or understanding as I should've.
Jinwu: It would've been immeasurably more difficult to complete our exploration without her maps... But I only showed concern for her health instead of focusing on her hard work and what she'd done so much to achieve...
Jinwu: Agh, how did I not realize how her work was always different from that of us miners...
Traveler: She just doesn't want to be forgotten.
Jinwu: Well, don't we all, as people who aren't favored by the gods...
Jinwu: Don't we all... But has anyone been as obsessed as her?
Jinwu: And yet, when I think about the moment when I gave up any thoughts of becoming great... when I realize that I've gotten to used to living day to ordinary day...
Jinwu: I feel like I just don't have the right to judge Zhiqiong...
