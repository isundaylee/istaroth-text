## Talk 3

Ruins Treasure: My fellow disciple and I trained in the martial arts from childhood. Our quest was to fight the forces of evil and protect all that is sacred in this world. But this was no easy task without the aid of a Vision.
Ruins Treasure: We two sought refuge here to train ourselves further and to seek the Visions that we desired. We erected this monument in testament to our endeavors.

## Talk 4

Traveler: Touch the monument

## Talk 5

Ruins Treasure: Monsters are the bane of all that is worth living for in this world. Those of us who are skilled with the blade are duty-bound to hunt them out of existence.
Ruins Treasure: Monsters are evil! They deserve nothing more than the merciless slaughter they will get!

## Talk 6

Traveler: Touch the monument

## Talk 7

Ruins Treasure: But now that my fellow disciple has obtained his Vision, instead of battling against monsters, he asked me, "Are monsters truly evil by nature?" So I replied to him, "They wreak havoc all across the world, and innocent people are the ones who must suffer the consequences. Is that so insufficiently evil that you should stay your blade?" I do believe an excess of meditation has fried his brain!
Ruins Treasure: Well, I still intend to take on these monsters â€” even if it means doing so without him, and even if it means doing without a Vision.
