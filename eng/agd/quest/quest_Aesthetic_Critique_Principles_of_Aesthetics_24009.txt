# Aesthetic Critique: Principles of Aesthetics


## Talk 1

Depierris: Traveler! You've come at just the right time! I just found a wondrous photo-taking spot — all I need is a little help from you!
Traveler: Still looking for inspiration, are you?
Depierris: Of course. This is far from enough materials — a single photo will not allow me to create a full picture.
Depierris: I usually need several dozen pictures — sometimes even a hundred — for use as reference material.
Traveler: That many, huh...
Depierris: As I've told you before, the focus of painting is "creation."
Depierris: If you simply impress the things you see upon the canvas as-is, that is not "painting" — that is "photography."
Depierris: What a painter must truly do is to use their sensitivity and aesthetic sense to observe the world around them, before curating, transforming, and editing it...
Depierris: Until such a time as the most beautiful aspect of every object can be abstracted and then engraved upon the canvas to complete one painting.
Traveler: Well, that was as clear as mud.
Depierris: You... Alright. Basically, I'll only use the prettiest parts of these pictures as reference.
Depierris: For example, the light-shadow balance here is excellent, but the scenery is lacking by contrast — as such, I will only refer to its use of the former.
Depierris: The other picture contains a traveler in a most fascinating pose, and the next features a most magnificent building...
Depierris: It is almost like playing with a puzzle in your mind, with the beauty or beastliness of the final product depending solely on your aesthetics and understanding.
Depierris: This is not a rigorous way of putting things, since we can also change or abstract the sights within the reference material themselves... but that's all you need to understand.
Traveler: So you still need my help, please and thank me.
Depierris: Uh... Right, yes, that's right! Your photo-taking skills are incredible — indeed, my friends have wanted to come see you in person after witnessing your work.
Depierris: I'm sure that with your help, I'll be able to create something truly extraordinary.
Depierris: So please, for the sake of human aesthetics — and for the Mora I've prepared — please help me!
Traveler: So I'll have to continue gathering material for you, or something.
Traveler: Speak more simply!
Traveler: Do the pictures have different uses?

## Talk 2

Depierris: Thank you for your help! This should be enough to fill my stomach...
Depierris: Here, you've earned this. Now, to grab a few quick bites...
Depierris: It might be worth bringing biscuits that may be stored in my bag next time...

## Talk 3

Depierris: Let me see... Those friends of mine gave me some suggestions that I've written in my notebook.
Depierris: Aquatic plants... waving... light and shadow... change... What was I writing? Had I had too much to drink? ... Yeah, that must've been it...
Depierris: Ahem. Please help me go underwater and take a picture of those aquatic plants.
Depierris: It seems that I was quite interested in the lights and shadows upon the aquatic plants back when I wrote these notes.

## Talk 4

Depierris: It lacks tension... What's going on?
Depierris: I feel like we're missing something... decisive...
Traveler: Taking photos, are we?
Depierris: That's right — this Kamera is the engine of inspiration for my paintings.
Depierris: My name is Depierris, and I am a painter — most pleased to meet you, most pleased indeed!
Traveler: Uh... huh. Likewise...?
Depierris: Now, I would normally treat a newfound friend to a coffee, but alas, there is no café to be found nearby.
Depierris: Hmm. Well, why don't you take this Fonta — let us have a toast, and we'll consider ourselves formally acquainted! Have you been to Fontaine before, by the way?
Traveler: I'm a first-time visitor.
Depierris: Ah, then you're in for a good time! Head into the city and see the sights — like the waterways stretching out overhead!
Depierris: Then you can head out into the streets and see the intricate machines, even if not all of them have aesthetic value — well, in the opinion of this humble painter, anyway.
Depierris: And finally, you can sit yourself down at a café and appreciate a cup of coffee.
Depierris: Who knows, perhaps someone will come to chat you up while you do so!
Depierris: Still, if the person who comes up to you claims to be from some sort of "Kamera Club"...
Depierris: Then be on your guard for their words of folly... There are those amongst them who are engaged in it, in any case.
Traveler: And what are these elements doing exactly?
Depierris: What, you ask? No less than set cultural life in our grand Fontaine on the path to annihilation!
Depierris: Now, this is no mere fearmongering. Can you guess what they speak of in this club?
Depierris: "If we speak only of pictures, then those taken by Kameras are far superior to paintings."
Depierris: I mean, just listen to that "if we speak only of pictures" nonsense — and it is but nonsense, no matter how loudly they proclaim it to be the truth!
Depierris: If we simply present images as they are, where would the space be for aesthetics?
Depierris: Well, it is true that some of us are indeed figuring out how to draw even better naturalistic work... But even that is rooted in their aesthetic sense.
Depierris: Aesthetics! Aesthetics are the key — do you understand?
Traveler: N—Not really...
Depierris: The observation of the world through the artist's eyes is merely the first step. We must explore sensibility and beauty through the brush to bring a masterpiece forth from the heart.
Depierris: Not all those who love Kameras are brutish imbeciles bereft of all artistic sense, of course.
Depierris: I have many friends who love Kameras, and I love speaking to them. At times, their photos inspire me, and my paintings inspire them in turn.
Depierris: Those who know nothing of art and only know how to blow their own trumpets... Oh, how they make my blood boil!
Depierris: They disgrace those who love photography and painting alike! They truly are... *cough*... *cough*
Traveler: Calm down, get some water...
Depierris: Ah, thank you... I cannot prevent my rage from boiling over every time I speak of this matter.
Depierris: As such, I, along with some friends, have decided to use this Kamera to take pictures that may be used as material with which to create a series of paintings.
Depierris: Afterward, we will place these paintings alongside the pictures used to create them in an exhibition — and then, all shall see the difference between paintings and photography!
Depierris: Yet, *sigh* I see little meaning in the various pictures I've taken. My friends tell me that the best sights may be found in the direst of lands.
Depierris: Underwater, for example, or on cliffs, or perhaps the deep wood where few humans go... But I dare not go to such places alone.
Depierris: And hiring adventurers may take too much time...
Depierris: #Hmm... Dear sir, would you mind coming under an artist's employ?
Traveler: As long as you don't make me do the painting...
Depierris: No need to worry! We shall both simply do what we're good at.
Depierris: You need not worry about the payment either. I often hire adventurers as guards on my inspiration-gathering trips, so I know the rules.
Depierris: It's just that this matter was too urgent, and I could not hire anyone in time...
Depierris: Well, that's settled, then. With your help, I grow ever more confident in my odds of producing good work.
Traveler: I'm only really good at adventurer stuff.
Traveler: S—Somewhat?
Traveler: Will these... elements do anything to me?
Depierris: Just as they have done for Fontaine — they will destroy the cultural life you should have shared in.
Traveler: Are you a Kamera hobbyist?
Depierris: The Kamera, my hobby? No, no, it is merely a reference tool — I am fonder of my paintbrush by far.

## Talk 5

Depierris: Let me see... Those friends of mine gave me some suggestions that I've written in my notebook.
Depierris: "The great underwater ruins!"
Depierris: Seriously? I wrote those words with such force that the paper nearly tore...
Depierris: But I do suppose that such a place might suggest a unique beauty.
Depierris: Well, in that case, please help me take a picture of just such ruins — the larger the better, the more horribly ruined, the better!

## Talk 6

Depierris: Have you managed to get some Garlic Baguette?

## Talk 7

Depierris: Let me see... Those friends of mine gave me some suggestions that I've written in my notebook.
Depierris: What did I even write here? Let me see... Uh, underwater... rugged rocks... the plants on the rocks... the rocks' contours...
Depierris: Uh, yes, that's right. I was studying rocks — obsessively, in fact, for their ability to best exhibit natural beauty.
Depierris: Anyway, I'd like you to help me snap a shot of underwater rocks. I wonder what their contours will be like...

## Talk 8

Depierris: Aesthetics — aesthetics are the key!

## Talk 9

Depierris: Thank you for your help! This should be enough to fill my stomach...
Depierris: Here, you've earned this. Now, to grab a few quick bites...
Depierris: It might be worth bringing biscuits that may be stored in my bag next time...

## Talk 10

Depierris: Have you got the picture?
Traveler: Here it is.
Depierris: Let me see...
Depierris: Ah! Perfection! Perfection! I never expected you to be quite so outstanding a photographer.
Depierris: From this image shall I filter the best material possible!
Depierris: Thank you so much. Mm... Where did I leave that Mora...
Depierris: Alright, this is for you — please, take it! If the chance arises in the future, please, do help me take a few more pictures!
Depierris: Now then... What about the composition...

## Talk 11

Depierris: This... This isn't good...
Traveler: What photo do you need taken this time?
Depierris: This time... Well, there's no need to take any photos. Actually, I have another favor to ask of you.
Depierris: Ahem, this is quite embarrassing, but, ah... Could you help me find something to eat... Garlic Baguette, for example?
Traveler: You... didn't bring anything to eat?
Depierris: No! I brought a lot of bread, along with some jam and jerky. That should've been enough for the day...
Depierris: But I put the foodstuffs aside to focus on the painting, and I soon got engrossed... By the time I realized that I was hungry, they were gone.
Depierris: Maybe some animal or hungry passerby made off with it on the sly — in which case, I do hope it fills their tummies.
Depierris: Unfortunately, mine shall have to be filled some other way... And I cannot return to the city now — not without having gathered enough material.
Traveler: Wait just a moment, then.
Depierris: I'll be counting on you, then. You can get some in the city.
Depierris: Haha... Ooh, I feel a little weak. Is it the hunger? Or have I just been thinking too much...
Traveler: I'll get you what you need.
Traveler: Did you... run out of Mora to buy food?
Traveler: Where to this time?
