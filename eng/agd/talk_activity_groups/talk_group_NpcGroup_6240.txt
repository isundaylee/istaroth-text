Matzil: Hello, have you come to see these children too?

## Talk

Traveler: Children?
Matzil: Yup! These chubby little guys are pretty cute, don'cha think?
Matzil: When I talk to them, I can't help but don a softer voice... Haha, it must sound weird to anyone else listening.

## Talk

Traveler: I'll have a look at them while on my way.
Matzil: You're welcome to do so, but do take care not to disturb them.

## Talk

Traveler: Totally understandable.
Matzil: Yes. Just as people meow whenever they see a kitten, I can't help but call out to a Saurian whelp whenever I see one.
Matzil: Once they're a bit bigger, I can ride an adult Saurian and bring the kids along for a joyride.
Matzil: As they grow older, they begin to develop unique character traits and will choose the rider they identify with most.
Matzil: So the time when little Saurians follow you about innocently should be cherished.
