Traveler: What are Xiao Lanterns?
Nervous An: Good question. As you might have guessed, you can't have a Lantern Rite without lanterns!
Nervous An: Usually home-made, they consist of a paper frame with a wick inside. After lighting the wick, Plaustrite is inserted to make it float.
Nervous An: Before releasing it into the air, people will write their wishes on wish sticks and insert them into the lantern. The lantern then carries their wishes off into the night sky.
Nervous An: Liyue may be well known for its mining industry, but fortunately, being surrounded by rocks hasn't turned people's hearts to stone...
Nervous An: Maybe it's because we also live off the sea. That romantic idea of the gentle sea breeze has found its way into our hearts... Haha.
Nervous An: Would you care to try making your own Xiao Lantern? After all, it's not every day you get to be in Liyue during Lantern Rite.
