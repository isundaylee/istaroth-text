Traveler: So, what's the deal with you and Este...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): As you have seen, he was a friend of mine, and one of the survivors of Remuria's destruction.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): In later days, he followed me into the newborn Fontaine and was laid to rest there.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): The spring waters responded to us, who were entrapped in rock, just as it did ordinary Fontainians, and he had children of his own, building a family there...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): His bloodline became joined to that of Fontaine, and all came to forget that he was no ordinary mortal.

Traveler: (Pet him.)
Traveler: It's nothing.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Alright. If there is anything you wish to know, do not hesitate to ask me.
