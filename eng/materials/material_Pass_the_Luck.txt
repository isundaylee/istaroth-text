# Pass the Luck

Mualani's specialty. Feet planted on her surfboard, dish in hand, she made not one, not two, but three loops around you before placing the sizable lobster before you. "Ta-da! Super huge and freshly caught â€” a stroke of luck if ever there was one! And now, I pass that luck onto you!" Her cheerful words all but grant the bean balls wrapped around the shrimp a golden glow.
