Traveler: Tell me a bit about yourself...
Uncle Anpu: I've been the head of Aaru Village for a long time now. If anything happens, just come find me.
Uncle Anpu: Food, lodgings... Whatever I can help with, I will, to the best of my abilities.
Uncle Anpu: Also, if you encounter loose sands or abnormally strong winds out there in the desert, it's safer if you take shelter in the village as soon as possible.
Uncle Anpu: ...Well, these don't always guarantee that a sandstorm will follow, but it never hurts to be careful...
Uncle Anpu: Haha, would you look at that? I'm getting long-winded in my old age. Please don't mind me, youngster, hehe...

Traveler: Hello there, Uncle Anpu.
Uncle Anpu: Ah, it's you! How have you been?
Uncle Anpu: Isak mentioned you to me earlier. Said that he wanted to thank you properly.
Uncle Anpu: That kid's fond of you — I can tell. You're quite the example to him.
Uncle Anpu: A good thing, of course. Always good to see children be enthusiastic and hardworking. Always glad to see that.
Uncle Anpu: If you aren't going to be too busy in the next couple of days, perhaps you might want to rest your feet here. Aaru Village will always welcome you.

Traveler: Thanks for the reminder.
Uncle Anpu: Good, good, as long as I got through to you.
Uncle Anpu: I've seen many a reckless soul run into trouble out in the desert. It's very saddening.
Uncle Anpu: Of course, having the daring to challenge danger is a good thing, but you can't simply ignore danger altogether.

## Talk 4

Uncle Anpu: My old pal, what do you think? When we're too old to remember anything, will there be any young people willing to take our places?
Belkacem: Of course! Don't say things like that.
Belkacem: Our village may be small, but we've got quite a lot of decent youngsters here.
Belkacem: Never mind the people who came back from working with the Eremites, even Kazim's boy is working hard, you know?
Uncle Anpu: Ah, true, true. You're right. I must've been overthinking.
Uncle Anpu: I'm sure we'll have more reliable successors like Candace in our village.
Belkacem: Of course! Speaking of Candace, remember when she was a little girl?
Belkacem: How she'd go to the wrong house because of her poor eyesight?
Uncle Anpu: ... Yes, yes. That did happen, I believe. Hah, between the two of us, I guess you're the one with good memory...
