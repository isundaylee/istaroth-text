Traveler: Don't beat yourself up over this...
Tejima: You know, that's the funny part. I can't even remember how she looks even though I loved her so much. And you'd think I would be sad.
Tejima: But for me, forgetting someone is the same as having all thoughts of them severed. I can't feel anything for them I can't even think of them.
Tejima: She's probably the one that's really sad, seeing as how I've completely forgotten about her...
Tejima: Still, thanks for retrieving those journals. Even though I still have no recollection of her, it's good to know that I was once so determined.
Tejima: I will continue to wait here for her. The me from before wouldn't have wanted to let her down...
