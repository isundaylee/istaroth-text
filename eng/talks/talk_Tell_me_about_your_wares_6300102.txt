Traveler: Tell me about your wares...
Yayoi Nanatsuki: If you want the best lacquerware in Inazuma, this is the place to be.
Yayoi Nanatsuki: We sell only the highest-quality items. Even big shots from the Shogunate order from us.
Yayoi Nanatsuki: Our venerable store has been around for many years. I am the fourth generation owner and have inherited the pursuit of perfection from my ancestors.
Yayoi Nanatsuki: Add that to the unique craftsmanship I learned from Sumeru, and I am sure that I will have much to add to our legacy.
