# Delicious Crystal Shrimp

One of Liyue's traditional snacks. The outer skin is as clear as its crystal namesake, and when it enters the mouth, one's tongue could be forgiven for thinking that the fresh shrimp within is still alive. Those who eat it can only lament that four pieces per serving is far, far too few.
