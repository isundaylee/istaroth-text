# State of the Holy Lyre der Himmel


## Talk 1

Venti: Welcome back!
Venti: Ah, this is the Holy Lyre! You managed to retrieve it!
Venti: The pattern of flowing wind carved on the rosewood... and the strings still feel cool to the touch too. Oh, the memories...
Jean: What do you think, Venti? Can you summon Dvalin?
Venti: Although this lyre is the real thing, I doubt that it's going to work.
Venti: As you can see, the lyre has been through a thousand years of history. Its Anemo power has run dry.
Venti: In this condition, you couldn't play music fit for even Diluc's tavern with it...
Diluc: Bards fight to get on the stage of my tavern. Don't make assumptions!
Paimon: Is that really important right now, Master Diluc!?
Paimon: And you — did you just borrow the Holy Lyre to play music for drunkards to hear?
Venti: Hehe.
Paimon: What do you mean "hehe"!?
Venti: Anyway, we won't be able to call Dvalin with it.
Venti: The lyre itself is fine, but the strings...
Venti: You're up, outlander!
Traveler: Are you talking about me?
Venti: Relax! It's not broken.
Venti: It's just that the intensity of its Anemo power has greatly diminished.
Venti: #{NICKNAME}, do you still have Dvalin's Teardrop Crystal with you?
Traveler: *nods*
Traveler: I don't know how to fix instruments.

## Talk 2

Venti: Great! Try to use it on the Holy Lyre.
Traveler: Let me give it a try.

## Talk 3

Venti: It worked, as expected.
Jean: This youthful glow...
Paimon: Praising yourself? Really?
Jean: ...I was talking about the Holy Lyre.
Venti: #Thanks to {NICKNAME} having purified the crystal, the Holy Lyre won't continue to lose power.
Venti: That said, its power is far from replenished. It'd be great if we could get more tears.
Traveler: We'll help.
Paimon: How can we gather more?
Venti: I can surmise that Dvalin will already be crying...
Venti: Suffering alone in some deserted place...
Jean: Dvalin...
Paimon: Poor baby...
Jean: This is not something that an Honorary Knight can accomplish alone. I will mobilize the rest of the knights to assist.
Jean: #When you get the Teardrop Crystal, please let {NICKNAME} perform the purification process.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Venti: Heroes supporting each other and setting out on a journey together... How exciting!
Venti: Lemme come up with a song for you...
Paimon: Is that all you're going to do? Just sing?
Venti: Wouldn't be much of a bard if I didn't now, would I?
Paimon: Hmph. You're so cheeky... You deserve an ugly nickname.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon knows! From now on, you'll be known as "<color=#00E1FFFF>Tone-Deaf Bard</color>"!
Traveler: Right. How do we do that?
Traveler: How can we make Dvalin cry? By hitting him?
