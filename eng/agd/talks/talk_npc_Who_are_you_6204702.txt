# Talk Dialog

Qian: Who are you?
Qian: I work as a miner, or at least that's what I used to do. Now that the Chasm's been sealed off, I just wander around without a job to do.
Qian: Maybe if I had something to do, I wouldn't be so picky about what to eat. But now that I've already tried all the places around here, I don't have a clue what I want to eat today.
Qian: Are you sure you'll be alright unemployed?
Qian: You needn't worry!
Qian: Seeing as you don't appear to be a Millelith, I'll let you in on something.
Qian: When I was working down in the Chasm, I moved some raw materials out on the sly. I'm talking real high quality stuff, like what Shitou has at The Jade Mystery. People would buy it by the boatload!
Qian: Actually, I've been looking for a partner. Whaddya think? Are you in?
Qian: Imagine, you'll be able to eat and drink whatever you please, just as if Yujing Terrace was your very own kitchen!
