# Jnagarbha Day


## Talk 1

Paimon: There's a light flashing on your Akasha Terminal. It's almost like... the faster it blinks, the better the signal.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Whoa, it's Mora! Ooh, Mora... No Paimon, we're not here to hunt for treasure!

## Talk 3

Nilou: This isn't the way to the Akademiya. Better stick to the plan.

## Talk 4

Paimon: #We might as well prepare for a fight, {NICKNAME}.
Paimon: When we're done, we can take a walk around. After all, we missed out on a lot of stuff when we were locked up.

## Talk 5

Sheikh Zubayr: Always remember that your safety comes first. Don't forget that you're the star of Zubayr Theater.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Aargh, don't lock us up! Let us out!
Paimon: Waaah!
Traveler: ...That's enough, Paimon.
Paimon: Oh yeah, hehe... Paimon got a bit carried away there. How was Paimon's acting just now? Great, huh?
Traveler: Marvelous.
Paimon: Hehe, everything's going according to plan so far! We made it into confinement, and Alhaitham's probably done with his part, too.
Traveler: That was close.
Paimon: We even managed to trick Grand Sage Azar. Alhaitham sure knows how to cook up a plan.
Paimon: What are we doing next? Paimon has trouble remembering things when she's worked up...
Traveler: Let's review what we discussed during our strategy meeting.
Paimon: Right right~! Paimon thinks it went something like this...
Alhaitham: #...Apart from that, we still have yet another goal in the first stage of our operation, which is to send {NICKNAME} to the confinement room.
Paimon: #What!? Why do we want to get {NICKNAME} locked up on purpose?
Alhaitham: #{NICKNAME}'s always been the person the sages are most afraid of, as well as the greatest obstacle to the successful implementation of their plan. They are very aware of the risk {F#she}{M#he} poses to them.
Alhaitham: #Once {NICKNAME} is imprisoned, the sages will likely think that everything is under control...
Alhaitham: And with their guard down, the next phase of our plan will have a much higher chance of success.
Cyno: Hmph, I can already see the pompous looks on their faces.
Paimon: Oh, that's a super tricky plan. But, Paimon still thinks it's not really worth it...
Alhaitham: #That isn't the only reason, of course. {NICKNAME} has a more important task once {M#he}{F#she}'s in confinement.
Alhaitham: According to the Akademiya scholars in Rahman's custody, Lesser Lord Kusanali has sealed off her consciousness in the Akasha ever since she was captured by The Doctor.
Alhaitham: That way, they can't pry any more information from her.
Alhaitham: Even if we break into the Sanctuary of Surasthana, it will take time to awaken Lesser Lord Kusanali's consciousness — we need to do that in advance.
Paimon: So our job is to wake up Nahida! Okay, totally worth getting thrown in jail for.
Alhaitham: The confinement room is inside the Akademiya, close to the Sanctuary of Surasthana. It's a completely enclosed space, and you won't be receiving any visitors.
Alhaitham: I'll work with Rahman's scholars to make some modifications to your Akasha Terminal. Once you're in, get as close as you can to Lesser Lord Kusanali and try to connect to her consciousness.
Alhaitham: However, as for whether she'll actually wake up... That will depend on our luck.
Paimon: Oh~ No wonder you've been wearing your Akasha Terminal today. It's the one that Alhaitham modified.
Paimon: Paimon thought they'd take our Akasha Terminals when they locked us up in here. Hmm, were they being careless?
Traveler: That wasn't because of carelessness, but of their arrogance.
Paimon: Alright, so what now?
Traveler: We first need to find the place with the best signal in this room.
Paimon: Sounds easy enough. We can finally talk with Nahida after all this time... Let's do it!
Traveler: Then we try to connect with Nahida.
Traveler: They think the Akasha is completely under their control.
Traveler: We can relax for the time being.
Traveler: Not bad, but worse than mine.
Traveler: I don't think the guards can hear us anymore.

## Talk 7

Phaki: ...You think we'll get yelled at again if we play here?
Habi: Psh, there's nothing to be scared about. If we can shake Mr. Zubayr, the people at the Akademiya will be a piece of cake.
Phaki: But that grandpa with the blue hat and long beard looks really scary... You think he'll be here today?

## Talk 8

Mir: ...I thought you'd be interested in the Jnagarbha Day ceremony, but you're just out here instead.
Azmi: Resting when everyone else is busy makes this moment even more idyllic. *sigh* You still have so much to learn when it comes to romance!
Mir: Uh... Okay, as long as you're happy.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Eh, is this the right spot? Are you getting anything?
Traveler: It's faint, but...I have a signal.
Traveler: Preparing to connect with her consciousness now.
Paimon: Aah, please work!
Traveler: (Is this... a realm of consciousness?)
Traveler: (Nahida's not moving. She really has sealed off her consciousness... I need to think of a way to wake her up.)
Traveler: (What is this...? It looks like... some sort of barrier?)
Traveler: (Is Nahida using this barrier to isolate her consciousness from the outside world?)
Traveler: Nahida!
Nahida: ...
Traveler: Hey, Nahida!
Traveler: (Dang it, she isn't reacting. Seems like she can't sense me...)
Nahida: ...
Traveler: !!
Traveler: !!
Nahida: ...When did it first start?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): ...Oh, right. It started from the moment I was born.

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): So I've kept studying...

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): So I can catch up...

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): But, I'm stuck in the Sanctuary of Surasthana...

Traveler: Nahida!!!
Traveler: (What now... Is there really nothing I can do?)
Traveler: (But... she's right here in front of me. I can't just give up like this...)
Traveler: (I had already left her behind once when The Doctor first appeared. I can't do that again...)
Traveler: Nahida!!!
Nahida: ...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): It's... so quiet here.

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): Do archons have them?

Nahida: ...
Nahida: It's... so quiet here.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Since you're the God of Wisdom...
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: You've known the answers to all these questions since the very beginning, haven't you?
Nahida: Who... are you? Whose voice is that? It sounds familiar...
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: ...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): ...You're right, though.

Traveler: !!
Traveler: !!
Traveler: Nahida!!!
Nahida: Ah...
Traveler: Nahida?
Nahida: #{NICKNAME}? Did you... wake me up? Thank you. Why are you here...
Traveler: We're here to rescue you... Are you all right?
Nahida: I'm fine. It's just...
Nahida: When I think of everything that's happened to me, I feel really angry now.
Traveler: ...
Traveler: ...You should've been angry ages ago.
Paimon: #Eh? Oh, you're back, {NICKNAME}. How's everything?
Traveler: We're done here.
Traveler: Nahida is awake.
Paimon: That's wonderful news! Great, we weren't locked up for nothing!
Paimon: When you went to wake up Nahida, Paimon was listening for any sounds outside.
Paimon: You were out for a long time... There are fewer and fewer scholars going about now. You think everyone's done with their Jnagarbha Day stuff?
Traveler: I guess they finished entering all the Knowledge Capsules.
Paimon: Yep, so that means our next act is... Nilou's performance!

## Talk 10

Vihar: Hey, it's you guys! How did your plan go? Are you here for Nilou?
Paimon: It went really well! And yeah, where's Nilou?
Vihar: Great to hear! Nilou's already returned to the Grand Bazaar. Just now, a crowd of Akademiya students came by to ask Nilou for her signature. I've never seen her run away so fast!
Vihar: To think the Akademiya wants to ban artistic performances... Hehe, I think their students would be the first to disagree.

## Talk 11

Sheikh Zubayr: Nilou, are you sure about this? You're taking such a great risk for them...
Nilou: I'm sure, and I'm going. You know that I don't like to pass up any opportunity to dance, and this one is especially important.
Sheikh Zubayr: *sigh* Alright. You seem to have a lot of trust in them, so I won't say more on the subject.
Sheikh Zubayr: But if anything happens, the few of us here may not be able to help you.
Nilou: Don't worry, they've been through worse. Everything's going to be fine!
Sheikh Zubayr: Alright. You know... if you really do get arrested, we'll do everything we can to get you back. Be careful, even if it's only for our sakes.
Nilou: Hehe, thanks, Mr. Zubayr. You're so very kind.

## Talk 12

Hushang: Nilou! How's it going? Nervous?
Nilou: Definitely more than usual, but it's because I'm worried I won't dance well enough.
Farhad: It's okay, just focus on your performance. We'll take care of everything else.
Hushang: Heh, you sure know how to talk. Taking all the credit, even though we came here together to help out.
Nilou: Well, thank you both! I'll have to treat you to a meal after all this ends. I really, really appreciate all of your help.
Hushang: Ooh, that sounds great! How can we say no to that?
Farhad: Alright, let's get back to business. Nilou, we'll be here to keep people from going to the Akademiya, so they don't interrupt your performance.
Hushang: I was planning on telling them something like, "The Akademiya's been conducting a weird experiment, and some of their test subjects escaped. It's really dangerous there, so stay away!"
Farhad: Ugh, you couldn't think of anything better? *sigh* Oh well, I guess it does sound like something the Akademiya would do.
Nilou: Hehe, I think it sounds great. I'm counting on you guys!
Hushang: Don't worry, it'll be a piece of cake!

## Talk 13

Vihar: Hey, Nilou. Sorry, it's great to see you, but I'm really busy right now. Our "Bait People Away with Yalda Candies" plan is working beautifully.
Vihar: Do you want some candy? We have more than we can give out.
Nilou: Vihar, thank you so much for doing all of this, and even dressed up as the Knight of Flowers, no less.
Nilou: I'll pass on the candy, though. I cut back on sweets in the period leading up to a performance, and I'm about to start one!
Vihar: Haha, you have a point. The "stage" is cleared and everything's ready, so you can start your performance at any time.
Nilou: Yeah, thanks to you. I'm really grateful. Alright, time to hit the "stage"!
Vihar: You're welcome. The honor's all mine, since I'll have such a great view of the show.

## Talk 14

Observe the unconscious guards...: (Someone has knocked these two guards out and removed their Akasha Terminals not long ago. No one seems to have noticed them yet.)
Observe the unconscious guards...: (If they were escorting someone before being knocked out, that person must've escaped.)

## Talk 15

Paimon: #Ehhh, did you hear that, {NICKNAME}? It sounds like a lot of guards just ran by.
Paimon: Does this mean the plan has moved onto the next stage?
Traveler: Certainly sounds like it.
Paimon: Yep yep! It's great that everything seems to be going well.
Paimon: Come to think of it, when did Alhaitham replace the Knowledge Capsule that was about to be entered into the Akasha?
Traveler: When he pretended that he had been corrupted...
Paimon: Oh, so that's when he did it!
Paimon: Paimon was too nervous to notice.
Paimon: Speaking of, didn't Alhaitham also yoink the Divine Knowledge Capsule from that mercenary leader in Port Ormos when everyone else was distracted?
Paimon: It's a time-tested trick of his...
Traveler: He can maintain his composure when things get chaotic.
Paimon: Hmph. Why are we complimenting him? Yeah, he's smart and all, but he still makes Paimon's blood boil!
Paimon: Let's review our plan for this stage again! It's not like we have anything else to do right now anyway, and it'll help us feel more confident.
Paimon: Paimon remembers that Nilou's task was supposed to go a bit like this...
Alhaitham: ...Now that Lesser Lord Kusanali's consciousness has been forcefully sealed, the core figures of the Akademiya and their guards have started to wear their Akasha Terminals again.
Alhaitham: With The Doctor's technological support, they think they have nothing to fear.
Cyno: How despicable of them to rely on such a person.
Alhaitham: But, this is also our chance.
Alhaitham: I was originally asked to draft the Knowledge Capsule for the "Artistic Performances Prohibition Act" when I was still at the Akademiya.
Alhaitham: It should be on the Grand Sage's desk right now, and will be entered into the Akasha during the next Jnagarbha Day.
Paimon: Are they really going to stop all artistic performances? That's horrible...
Alhaitham: I'll make an identical Knowledge Capsule, but this time, I'll "smuggle" some misleading information into it.
Alhaitham: We only need to find an opportunity to switch the capsules. Once it's been entered into the Akasha on Jnagarbha Day, if someone were to be seen performing in public...
Alhaitham: The sages would definitely use that opportunity to announce the ban, and so the misleading information will be disseminated amongst the guards.
Dehya: Sure sounds complicated, but it seems like if everything goes well, we'll be able to get rid of all the guards in the Akademiya without any effort...
Dehya: That's pretty clever. Gettin' right into their heads.
Dehya: I just have one question. Even if we manage to get the misleading info out to the guards, how can we be sure that they'll believe it?
Alhaitham: People who are used to relying on the Akasha become less inquisitive, and their ability to distinguish truth from misinformation is significantly reduced... They will view everything the Akasha releases to them as the unequivocal truth.
Cyno: The Akasha will turn humans into "machines." I've seen it happen many times.
Dehya: Yikes... Good thing I didn't wear it for long when I was working in Sumeru City. At first, I thought it was a good thing, too.
Dehya: By the way, this plan still requires a performer, right?
Alhaitham: Do you have someone in mind?
Dehya: Nilou of Zubayr Theater. I know her really well. We can trust her.
Dehya: I'm kinda hesitant to ask her to participate in a dangerous plan like this, but we can ask her in person.
Alhaitham: Alright. After the guards in the Akademiya are gone...
Dehya: Then it'll be time for me and my stowaway brothers to shine.
Traveler: That's why he can pull off this kind of thing...
Traveler: Do you remember when he rushed towards the Grand Sage?
Traveler: It sounds like Nilou completed her task.

## Talk 16

Dehya: Here they come. Did you see that, Rahman? They came out from the Akademiya in droves!
Rahman: *whistle*
Rahman: After laying low in the city for so long, this is the moment we've been waiting for. My brothers have already sprung into action.
Dehya: Heh, we couldn't do anything to 'em inside their coop, but outside the Akademiya... This is our hunting ground.
Rahman: With a lioness like you, the prey sure won't be able to run far, haha.
Dehya: We still need to eliminate the guards as soon as possible. If we give the sages enough time to realize what's happening, the plan's doomed.
Rahman: Eh, all they've done is to sit on their cushy salaries and twiddle their thumbs all day while we fought and struggled every day in the desert. The only advantage they might have is their numbers.
Dehya: Speaking of which, most of the guards who report directly to the six sages belong to the Corps of Thirty, but they have a completely different reputation.
Dehya: Following those blasted sages' every whim, throwing away all the principles of being a mercenary... As someone in the same profession, I'm obligated to teach them a good lesson today.
Rahman: Indeed. The "trap" has been set. All we need to do is lead them there.
Dehya: Alright, let's each take a road and herd those scattered guards back into one place. Make sure to attract their attention. Isak will be the key.
Rahman: You gave such an important task to that child... Will he be okay?
Dehya: It'll be fine. Isak was so determined to help, so let's put our faith in him.
Dehya: Besides, even if he's caught, the guards would be too scared to do anything to him... They've never seen Lesser Lord Kusanali in person, after all.
Rahman: You've got a point. Anyway, I think I see them coming. Let's head out.
Dehya: Good luck.

## Talk 17

Isak: Hmm, this outfit...
Tanina: Hey, do you remember what you need to do, Isak? When the guards get here, you'll pretend to be Lesser Lord Kusanali and run away from them.
Isak: Oh yeah... I remember, of course I do. I'm just a little nervous...
Tanina: Relax. Don't think about getting caught. Even if that happens, we won't leave you behind.
Tanina: You only need to think about getting the guards' attention and leading them to the Grand Bazaar. Leave the rest to us.
Isak: Okay, got it. I'm here to pay back Lesser Lord Kusanali for helping Grandpa. I won't get cold feet!
Maqrin: Hey, they're here! I can see the Akademiya guards!
Tanina: All right! It's time, Isak. Take a deep breath... and go! You can do this!
Isak: (Why is there a guard over there? Did he already run ahead of me?)
Isak: (This is different from our plan, but there's no time. I need to make a choice...)
Traveler: Hide in the field
Traveler: Hide behind the house
Akademiya Guard: Huh? Did I... just see something dart by?
Akademiya Guard: I'd better go have a look...
Akademiya Guard: Were my eyes playing tricks on me...?
Akademiya Guard: *rustle*
Akademiya Guard: I should go check to see if someone's hiding over there.
Traveler: Stealthily move to the right
Akademiya Guard: Hey! Stop, I saw you! Don't try to run!
Black Screen Text: Isak is caught by a guard. Mission failed...
Akademiya Guard: There seems to be nothing here. Just to be safe, I should look around.
Traveler: Leave the field
Akademiya Guard: Hey! Stop, I saw you! Don't try to run!
Black Screen Text: Isak is caught by a guard. Mission failed...
Isak: (Good thing they didn't find me. That was close... I'd better hurry and keep going.)
Akademiya Guard Captain: Hey! Lesser Lord Kusanali is over there. Stop!
Akademiya Guard: What, Lesser Lord Kusanali? How did I not see anything just now!
Isak: (Oh no, they found me! Where should I go?)
Traveler: Towards the city center
Traveler: Towards the Grand Bazaar
Traveler: Towards the city gate
Black Screen Text: Although Isak managed to avoid arrest, the mission failed...
Akademiya Guard Captain: The target, suspected to be Lesser Lord Kusanali, has escaped into the Grand Bazaar. Assemble and arrest her!
Isak: (How is this possible? There are also Akademiya guards here... Oh no...)
Black Screen Text: Isak is caught by the guards. Mission failed...
Akademiya Guard: Hmm... Let's have a look behind the house...
Isak: (What should I do next?)
Traveler: Hide towards the left
Akademiya Guard: Hey! Stop, I saw you! Don't try to run!
Black Screen Text: Isak is caught by a guard. Mission failed...
Akademiya Guard: Hmm, looks like nothing's here. What a waste of time.
Isak: (Luckily he didn't check behind the tree. What should I do next?)
Traveler: Return to the position behind the house
Black Screen Text: Isak is too tired and ends up falling asleep. Mission failed...
Isak: (The guard looks alert. What should I do next?)
Traveler: Keep waiting
Traveler: Find a good opportunity to dash out
Akademiya Guard: Doesn't seem like anything unusual's around here...
Akademiya Guard: Hey! Stop, I saw you! Don't try to run!
Black Screen Text: Isak is caught by a guard. Mission failed...
Isak: (Looks like the guard finally left. I needa go.)
Akademiya Guard Captain: Hey! Lesser Lord Kusanali is over there. Stop!
Akademiya Guard: What, Lesser Lord Kusanali? How did I not notice that!
Isak: (Ack, they found me! This is bad... Where should I go?)
Traveler: Towards the field
Traveler: Towards the city center
Traveler: Towards the Grand Bazaar
Isak: (How is this possible? There is also an Akademiya guard here... Oh no...)
Black Screen Text: Isak is caught by the guards. Mission failed...
Black Screen Text: Although Isak managed to avoid arrest, the mission failed...
Akademiya Guard Captain: The target, suspected to be Lesser Lord Kusanali, has escaped into the Grand Bazaar. Assemble and arrest her!

## Talk 18

Akademiya Guard Captain: ...Where did she go? How did she disappear? Did we lose her? Hurry up and find her!
Akademiya Guard: Hey... Why's your team here? Didn't we say to split up our search?
Akademiya Guard: Hurry, hurry! Eh? This place is... Why are you all here?
Rahman: Yeah, isn't it one heck of a coincidence? Everybody's here... What on earth is going on?
Rahman: I suppose that's all of you?
Akademiya Guard Captain: Who are you!? Did you set us up...? What are you planning?
Isak: *pant* Whew, that was rough. I almost got caught!
Akademiya Guard Captain: Little brat... So you're not actually Lesser Lord Kusanali? Who exactly are you all? Eremites from the desert?
Dehya: Just some colleagues. Think of this as a business competition or a personal grudge...
Dehya: After stepping into our trap, stop thinking of yourselves as "hunters." Behave like the "prey" you are.
Rahman: *whistle*
Akademiya Guard Captain: An ambush! How's that possible? This is Sumeru City, but mercenaries from the desert somehow ambushed us!?
Dehya: Tsk, you've spent all your time hiding away in the Akademiya. This place has long since become our hunting ground. Brace yourselves!

## Talk 19

Azar: Hmm... This is odd...
Azar: The Akademiya has quieted down after the conclusion of the Jnagarbha Day ceremonies, but it's much quieter than usual.
Azar: Where are the guards? Why have I not seen a single one...? Guards? Guards!
Uday: Grand Sage, how may I be of assistance?
Azar: I called for the guards. Why did you come?
Uday: Ah... M—My apologies, Grand Sage.
Uday: Right now, all Akademiya guards have entered the city to perform the ordered arrest. I thought you knew...
Azar: Arrest? Who is there to arrest...?
Azar: (I have an ominous feeling...)
Uday: A—Arrest Lesser Lord Kusanali, right? Is that not what the order was?
Azar: Lesser Lord Kusanali? You mean she has disappeared?
Uday: Ah, yes. I wouldn't dare make up something like that...
Uday: Right now, everyone is in a panic, and many are saying that... that Lesser Lord Kusanali will take revenge on us...
Azar: (What happened? Just what is going on?)
Azar: (Lesser Lord Kusanali somehow escaped? Was it Alhaitham and his party that freed her?)
Azar: (That's impossible... The Akademiya is heavily guarded today, and any order to release Lesser Lord Kusanali would be strictly confidential. Besides, Alhaitham and the Traveler are already in our hands...)
Azar: (What manner of trickery did they employ? How could Lesser Lord Kusanali disappear into thin air...?)
Azar: (Disappear... Wait...)
Azar: How was the arrest order distributed to the guards?
Uday: It was issued by the Akasha earlier today. Only you have the authority to send messages like that, so I thought it was your order...
Azar: ...Let me check.
Azar: ...Ah, here.
Azar: "Lesser Lord Kusanali has escaped from the Sanctuary of Surasthana. Go to the city and arrest the escapee immediately..."
Azar: (The Akasha indeed contains this information, and it clearly appeared in my mind.)
Azar: (...How did they bypass my permissions to issue this kind of message?)
Azar: (Was it the report about the Traveler that Alhaitham submitted?)
Azar: (No, I specifically checked that Knowledge Capsule before entering it into the Akasha... Could that have been... a red herring?)
Azar: (Well, even if I figure it out now, it won't make any difference. The important thing now is to confirm Lesser Lord Kusanali's status...)
Azar: Have you been to the Sanctuary of Surasthana to confirm that Lesser Lord Kusanali has indeed escaped?
Uday: Confirm? No, I—I haven't...
Uday: I—It may be a bit offensive to say this, but... Grand Sage, what you're saying doesn't make any sense...
Uday: How can the information in the Akasha be inaccurate...? What the Akasha decrees is fact — that is common knowledge to all of us...
Uday: If we have to confirm the information and knowledge from the Akasha ourselves...
Uday: Then how is that any different from us learning that information ourselves? Wouldn't Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's legacy lose its meaning that way...?
Azar: In the beginning, it was I who asked you to believe in the Akasha, to believe in the legacy left by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata... Are you trying to use my words against me?
Uday: N—No! Grand Sage, I'm merely confused because I believe in you. I never meant to refute you...
Azar: Hmph... Stay here and see if there are any suspicious people around... I'll go to the Sanctuary of Surasthana on my own.
Uday: Yes, Grand Sage...

## Talk 20

Black Screen Text: Grand Sage Azar arrives at the Sanctuary of Surasthana alone...
Azar: ("Lesser Lord Kusanali has escaped from the Sanctuary of Surasthana. Go to the city and arrest the escapee immediately...")
Azar: (How can that be...? Stop thinking about it, stop... It must be a trick of theirs. As long as I personally confirm it...)
Azar: Ah...
Azar: ...Impossible. That's impossible. There must be something wrong with my eyes...
Azar: ...
Azar: Eh? She really appeared again... What is the meaning of this...?
Cyno: What a comical sight, Azar.
Azar: ...!
Cyno: Once the Akasha has put certain thoughts into your head, even the Grand Sage can no longer see what's right in front of him.
Cyno: You all can only see the world in your mind, the one you think you know.
Cyno: And precisely because of this, you disregarded Lesser Lord Kusanali's existence...
Cyno: She has been a wise and worthy archon.
Azar: Cyno... Have you been waiting for a chance like this?
Azar: The Akasha predicted that you would return to the Akademiya to confront me, but I didn't expect it to turn out like this. I was careless.
Cyno: No, you were blinded. Your faults stem from your reliance on the Akasha. You're still the same as always.
Azar: I truly did not expect a proud person like you to cooperate with Alhaitham and the Traveler...
Cyno: People change, Azar. Admit it, the Akasha can't predict my actions anymore.
Azar: Hmph, then tell me, what have you found during your investigation?
Cyno: You want to buy time? This is the Sanctuary of Surasthana. Under your own regulations, even Akademiya staff are forbidden to come here... No one will come to save you.
Cyno: As for the investigation... I've at least confirmed that you are guilty of insurgency against the archon, a serious crime.
Azar: So what? Did you do all of this so I would plead guilty in front of you, General Mahamatra?
Cyno: No. I want you to plead guilty in front of the archon herself.
Cyno: You once said that I had no standing to judge you. So now, how about judgment in the name of a god?

## Talk 21

Paimon: Hmm... How long do we have to wait? Paimon wants to know how things are going out there!
Paimon: Paimon hasn't heard any sounds outside for a while. Hopefully something bad didn't happen...
Traveler: Don't think like that.
Paimon: Yeah, but aren't you scared that we might be locked up in here for the rest of our lives?
Paimon: Thinking about it, at least Paimon has you. We can still chat like this...
Paimon: When Paimon thinks of Nahida being imprisoned alone in the Sanctuary of Surasthana, Paimon can't help but feel sorry for her...
Dehya: Here comes your savior!
Paimon: Dehya! Hehe, Paimon just knew you would come to rescue us!
Traveler: You were scared out of your wits just a moment ago...
Dehya: You two really owe me some big thanks. I had to search through who knows how many guards to find the key here... It felt even more tiring than whacking 'em! I'm exhausted.
Paimon: Thanks a lot. Need Paimon to rub your shoulders?
Dehya: Uh... No, no, that's... Er, I'll pass.
Paimon: What are you afraid of? Oh, are you ticklish?
Dehya: Ugh, now isn't the time to talk about being ticklish...
Traveler: How are things going outside?
Dehya: Things in the city and on Cyno's side are both going well. The guards that stormed out of the Akademiya are all taken care of.
Dehya: The Corps of Thirty is in charge of the city's defenses, but we already talked to Asfand. They've been fed up with the sages bossing them around.
Dehya: As long as it doesn't break their employment contracts, they'll turn a blind eye.
Paimon: That's probably because you've been super great friends with them for a long time. So, how's Cyno doing?
Dehya: The Grand Sage is in his custody. Even I know how terrible it is to fall into Cyno's hands, so he probably does, too.
Dehya: Cyno forced him to release Lesser Lord Kusanali. He has no choice but to obey.
Dehya: So, hurry to the Sanctuary of Surasthana. Assuming nothing weird happened...
Dehya: ...We should've already rescued our archon.
Traveler: That all sounds amazing.
Dehya: Honestly, I didn't expect our ragtag bunch to do this well. We just came together last minute to save the archon, you know?
Dehya: All right, you two better go. I still have to clean up some messes in the city. See you around.
Traveler: We managed to rescue her!
Traveler: How's Nahida?
Traveler: We must trust our friends.

## Talk 22

Hushang: You really like to play cool in front of Nilou.
Farhad: Hey, cut it out... This isn't the time to chat about stuff like that.

## Talk 23

Paimon: Nahida...
Nahida: Should I say "It's nice to meet you"?
Nahida: This is the first time we've met in real life. Before, we've only met in dreams, consciousness, or when I was in someone else's body.
Traveler: We finally meet, Nahida.
Nahida: Thank you so much for coming to rescue me, but I also need to apologize...
Nahida: During this time, I did some self-reflection. My sense of inferiority and yielding to the Akademiya led to all of this, and created so much trouble for you all.
Traveler: Don't worry about it. You've also helped us a lot.
Paimon: Exactly! We're here because you're a good archon and one of our friends.
Nahida: Hehe... Thanks, you two.
Nahida: Whew... Amazing, so this is how it feels to walk out of that cage with my own body.
Nahida: It's like I just had an endlessly long dream... I can't even tell if I just woke up or was only now born into this world.
Nahida: My concept of "self" has become so clear...
Nahida: But now doesn't seem to be the time to indulge in this feeling.
Traveler: The Akademiya's god creation plan...
Nahida: Um, this is really embarrassing. You all just rescued an archon, and now she needs your help to save her country, and even the entire world.
Paimon: It's okay. With you here, Paimon's sure that everything will work out!
Nahida: There's one more thing...
Paimon: What is it?
Nahida: For all the things the Akademiya did to me, and for all the folly it committed in the name of wisdom... As their archon, I will make them pay!
Paimon: Ah...
Paimon: Wow! That's the spirit! You're finally standing up for yourself and not letting people walk all over you!
Nahida: Hehe... I understand now: To be a better archon, I first need to better myself.
Nahida: If you haven't even figured out how to be a caterpillar, how can you be a butterfly?
Traveler: This is knowledge that only you yourself could have discovered.
Nahida: Yes, true. Hm, that reminds me, I wonder how far along the Akademiya is with their god creation plan...
Nahida: We need to hurry and prevent the birth of that false god.
Nahida: I need to make some preparations. Since I'm now free, I can establish a direct link to the Akasha and control it.
Nahida: First things first, I need to remove the restrictions that The Doctor put on me in the Akasha...
Nahida: After that, I'll make some adjustments and revoke the sages' permissions. The Akasha will then be like how it originally was: only operable by the archon.
Nahida: ...After all, the Akademiya betrayed Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's trust.
Nahida: This might take some time. In the meantime, you should also work on your own preparations.
Nahida: If we don't stop the god creation plan in time, we'll be in for a tough fight.
Traveler: Saving Irminsul...
Traveler: You deserved to be freed.

### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: Eh, is this the right spot? Are you getting anything?
Traveler: It's faint, but...I have a signal.
Traveler: Preparing to connect with her consciousness now.
Paimon: Aah, please work!
Traveler: (Is this... a realm of consciousness?)
Traveler: (Nahida's not moving. She really has sealed off her consciousness... I need to think of a way to wake her up.)
Traveler: (What is this...? It looks like... some sort of barrier?)
Traveler: (Is Nahida using this barrier to isolate her consciousness from the outside world?)
Traveler: Nahida!
Nahida: ...
Traveler: Hey, Nahida!
Traveler: (Dang it, she isn't reacting. Seems like she can't sense me...)
Nahida: ...
Traveler: !!
Traveler: !!
Nahida: ...When did it first start?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): ...Oh, right. It started from the moment I was born.

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): So I've kept studying...

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): So I can catch up...

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): But, I'm stuck in the Sanctuary of Surasthana...

Traveler: Nahida!!!
Traveler: (What now... Is there really nothing I can do?)
Traveler: (But... she's right here in front of me. I can't just give up like this...)
Traveler: (I had already left her behind once when The Doctor first appeared. I can't do that again...)
Traveler: Nahida!!!
Nahida: ...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): It's... so quiet here.

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): Do archons have them?

Nahida: ...
Nahida: It's... so quiet here.
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: Since you're the God of Wisdom...
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: You've known the answers to all these questions since the very beginning, haven't you?
Nahida: Who... are you? Whose voice is that? It sounds familiar...
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata: ...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): ...You're right, though.

Traveler: !!
Traveler: !!
Traveler: Nahida!!!
Nahida: Ah...
Traveler: Nahida?
Nahida: #{NICKNAME}? Did you... wake me up? Thank you. Why are you here...
Traveler: We're here to rescue you... Are you all right?
Nahida: I'm fine. It's just...
Nahida: When I think of everything that's happened to me, I feel really angry now.
Traveler: ...
Traveler: ...You should've been angry ages ago.
Paimon: #Eh? Oh, you're back, {NICKNAME}. How's everything?
Traveler: We're done here.
Traveler: Nahida is awake.
Paimon: That's wonderful news! Great, we weren't locked up for nothing!
Paimon: When you went to wake up Nahida, Paimon was listening for any sounds outside.
Paimon: You were out for a long time... There are fewer and fewer scholars going about now. You think everyone's done with their Jnagarbha Day stuff?
Traveler: I guess they finished entering all the Knowledge Capsules.
Paimon: Yep, so that means our next act is... Nilou's performance!

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: #Ehhh, did you hear that, {NICKNAME}? It sounds like a lot of guards just ran by.
Paimon: Does this mean the plan has moved onto the next stage?
Traveler: Certainly sounds like it.
Paimon: Yep yep! It's great that everything seems to be going well.
Paimon: Come to think of it, when did Alhaitham replace the Knowledge Capsule that was about to be entered into the Akasha?
Traveler: When he pretended that he had been corrupted...
Paimon: Oh, so that's when he did it!
Paimon: Paimon was too nervous to notice.
Paimon: Speaking of, didn't Alhaitham also yoink the Divine Knowledge Capsule from that mercenary leader in Port Ormos when everyone else was distracted?
Paimon: It's a time-tested trick of his...
Traveler: He can maintain his composure when things get chaotic.
Paimon: Hmph. Why are we complimenting him? Yeah, he's smart and all, but he still makes Paimon's blood boil!
Paimon: Let's review our plan for this stage again! It's not like we have anything else to do right now anyway, and it'll help us feel more confident.
Paimon: Paimon remembers that Nilou's task was supposed to go a bit like this...
Alhaitham: ...Now that Lesser Lord Kusanali's consciousness has been forcefully sealed, the core figures of the Akademiya and their guards have started to wear their Akasha Terminals again.
Alhaitham: With The Doctor's technological support, they think they have nothing to fear.
Cyno: How despicable of them to rely on such a person.
Alhaitham: But, this is also our chance.
Alhaitham: I was originally asked to draft the Knowledge Capsule for the "Artistic Performances Prohibition Act" when I was still at the Akademiya.
Alhaitham: It should be on the Grand Sage's desk right now, and will be entered into the Akasha during the next Jnagarbha Day.
Paimon: Are they really going to stop all artistic performances? That's horrible...
Alhaitham: I'll make an identical Knowledge Capsule, but this time, I'll "smuggle" some misleading information into it.
Alhaitham: We only need to find an opportunity to switch the capsules. Once it's been entered into the Akasha on Jnagarbha Day, if someone were to be seen performing in public...
Alhaitham: The sages would definitely use that opportunity to announce the ban, and so the misleading information will be disseminated amongst the guards.
Dehya: Sure sounds complicated, but it seems like if everything goes well, we'll be able to get rid of all the guards in the Akademiya without any effort...
Dehya: That's pretty clever. Gettin' right into their heads.
Dehya: I just have one question. Even if we manage to get the misleading info out to the guards, how can we be sure that they'll believe it?
Alhaitham: People who are used to relying on the Akasha become less inquisitive, and their ability to distinguish truth from misinformation is significantly reduced... They will view everything the Akasha releases to them as the unequivocal truth.
Cyno: The Akasha will turn humans into "machines." I've seen it happen many times.
Dehya: Yikes... Good thing I didn't wear it for long when I was working in Sumeru City. At first, I thought it was a good thing, too.
Dehya: By the way, this plan still requires a performer, right?
Alhaitham: Do you have someone in mind?
Dehya: Nilou of Zubayr Theater. I know her really well. We can trust her.
Dehya: I'm kinda hesitant to ask her to participate in a dangerous plan like this, but we can ask her in person.
Alhaitham: Alright. After the guards in the Akademiya are gone...
Dehya: Then it'll be time for me and my stowaway brothers to shine.
Traveler: That's why he can pull off this kind of thing...
Traveler: Do you remember when he rushed towards the Grand Sage?
Traveler: It sounds like Nilou completed her task.
