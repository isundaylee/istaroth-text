## Talk

Yuuzou: Hi there, are you here to provide aid to Sangonomiya too?
Yuuzou: There's a lot that can be done to improve this equipment, so it'd be very helpful if you could help me find some high quality materials.

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Yuuzou: I'm a worker who was rescued by the Sangonomiya troops from the Tatarasuna Mikage Furnace ruins. I now work at their camp.
Yuuzou: The Vision Hunt Decree has brought pain and suffering to many people. It's no surprise that after the Tatarasuna workers provided refuge to people bearing Visions, they'd have grievances against the Shogunate.
Yuuzou: Though the Sangonomiya resistance may seem weak, they are a hundred times stronger still than the cold, unfeeling Shogunate.
Yuuzou: My powers may be limited, but I'd like to contribute to the resistance and help teach the Shogunate a lesson.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Yuuzou: If you bring back any high quality materials, please let me have a look at them. Farewell.

## Talk

Traveler: What can you tell me about the resistance?
Yuuzou: I hear that Sangonomiya Kokomi, the commander of the resistance, is both wise and a master tactician.
Yuuzou: It was due to Her Excellency's amazing directives and the battle instincts of General Gorou that the Shogunate wasn't able to secure an advantage during the course of the battle.
Yuuzou: It's all thanks to them that the Sangonomiya troops have managed to make it to this day.
