# The Great Tree


## Talk 1

Yasmin: Looks like it does need some proper care...
Traveler: What are you doing?
Yasmin: You are... Huh. Judging by your looks, you must be a traveler, yes?
Yasmin: I'm Yasmin, a student from Amurta. I'm here to study the Divine Tree.
Yasmin: The years this Divine Tree has seen exceed the total amount of rice grains contained in all the pilaf in Port Ormos.
Yasmin: It also holds the Akademiya up. It can be said to be as important as the vegetables at the bottom of Tandoori Roast Chicken.
Traveler: What kind of simile is this...
Yasmin: If anything untoward were to happen to it, Sumeru City in its entirety would face terrible disasters.
Yasmin: It might be harried by pests, or locusts bigger than a roof might rush out from the inside...
Yasmin: Or the branches might go into a growing frenzy, and the roots might sprout outward like floods from the earth, destroying every house in its path.
Yasmin: Or maybe the Divine Tree might wither so very quickly that its trunk falls on half of Sumeru City, crushing everything there...
Traveler: Thâ€”Those things aren't really gonna happen, right!?
Yasmin: Oh, of course. Or at least, everything has been totally fine so far.
Yasmin: But then again, it's not like the fungal beasts will warn you in advance before attacking you while you gather mushrooms in the forests.
Yasmin: That's why I'm here: to observe the tree and prepare for any incidents that might come our way.
Yasmin: But as you can see, my thoughts are as swift as a Dusk Bird, yet my strength is as feeble as a Starshroom.
Yasmin: So, Traveler, could you help me record the condition of the Divine Tree's roots at a few locations?
Yasmin: Usually, I hire adventurers to go with me, but no one seems to have been available this time around...
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Traveler: Do you researchers all talk like that...
Yasmin: Eh? Are you referring to the similes I'm using? Sorry about that. It's just how I talk...
Yasmin: People in the Akademiya have also talked to me about this, but I can't just change at the drop of a hat!
Yasmin: I'm counting on you this time. I'll be waiting for you here.
Traveler: This is your kind of analogy, eh, Paimon?
Paimon: Yeah, it is a great tree indeed...

## Talk 2

Yasmin: Traveler, what a coincidence. We meet again.
Traveler: Are you still doing your research?
Yasmin: Yes. Ladep and Pharez requested more data, so here I am, continuing my work.
Yasmin: That said, I wonder how those roots are doing right now...
Yasmin: Traveler, if you would, please help me record the conditions of the Divine Tree roots once again.

## Talk 3

Yasmin: I'm counting on you this time. I'll be waiting for you here.

## Talk 4

Yasmin: You're back. How are the Divine Tree roots?
Black Screen Text: You describe the condition of the roots to Yasmin...
Yasmin: ...Oh, if there are living creatures gathered there, then the area should still be full of vitality.
Yasmin: That means that the roots of the Divine Tree should be able to grow steadily without any serious problems for now.
Yasmin: The only concern... is the possible eutrophication of the surrounding water bodies, which might nourish more Fungi...
Yasmin: Anyway, here's your payment. Thanks for your help.
Yasmin: We'd best have Ladep and Pharez monitor the concentration of elements nearby...
