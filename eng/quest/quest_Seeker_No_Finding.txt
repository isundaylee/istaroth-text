# Seeker No Finding


## Talk 1

Chikya: The water level has risen somewhat... and the spring's now full of phlogiston.
Chikya: The water below my knees is warm, and I can feel a warmth flowing through my limbs... A lovely sensation.
Paimon: So the Sage's gift wasn't an "elixir that can cure all injuries," but rather the hot spring here?
Paimon: Paimon's not exactly surprised, given the People of the Springs aren't far off...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr...
Chikya: #Hehe, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}'s looking pretty cozy there.
Chikya: This isn't just any old hot spring, little floaty Paimon. Once a hero who has been chosen bathes in this spring, they'll be granted the power to wield phlogiston.
Paimon: Huh, really? So... What'll happen if Paimon dives in?
Chikya: Hmm, good question... Yes, I think I know. You'd still be Paimon, just a soaking wet one.
Paimon: Whaaat... Ugh, Paimon thought she might get to use phlogiston too, and transform into some kind of super awesome Pyro Paimon!
Chikya: Sadly, I think not, because you haven't been chosen...
Paimon: Wait a minute, Chikya... You knew that this hot spring would be the final gift, yet you claimed you were searching for an "elixir that can cure all injuries," and that you'd share it with us too!
Chikya: Hehe, there are so many types of injury in the world. How could you possibly expect a single elixir to be able to heal them all?
Chikya: But when it comes down to it, wisdom is the solution to all our worries. Yes, I tricked you this time, little Paimon. But when we make mistakes, we learn from 'em, and take one step closer to resolving our worries... Isn't that a wonderful outcome too?
Paimon: Huh, okay... That actually kinda makes sense...
Traveler: So, have your injuries been cured?
Chikya: No, not at all. My heart still aches from the niggling pain of all my various injuries. And in that sense, I've been tricked as well — tricked terribly, by myself.
Chikya: Even if I took a bath in a hot spring filled with phlogiston, I would still be unable to use it. In the past, so the ancient scrolls say, tribespeople who could not already wield phlogiston only ever learned to do so by passing the trial...
Chikya: So it hasn't had any effect at all!
Paimon: ...Wait. You're clearly from Natlan... but you can't use phlogiston?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr?
Chikya: Paimon, you know, these delayed responses of yours can be quite hurtful at critical moments like this! Yes, nearly everyone in Natlan can use phlogiston, but "nearly" is not "all."
Chikya: When I was very young, I once suffered a grave injury, in connection with the Abyss...
Chikya: It was a miracle that I even survived, and I was in terrible health. I told you I could jump great distances with an Iktomisaur on my back, but I'd be fooling you — for Iktomisaurs can float up and make themselves as light as a feather, so they don't weigh a thing.
Chikya: It may well be due to this injury that I am unable to use phlogiston. No matter what I try, I simply can't do it. I've wracked my brains, pored over all kinds of different scrolls...
Chikya: Though others view them as virtually obsolete, I am well-versed in analyzing "Phlogiston Engraving" through patterns. I put lots of effort into memorizing all the meanings, honing a great memory while doing so.
Chikya: For me, teaching the children of our tribe the basics about phlogiston was also an opportunity to observe how they would discover the ability to use it. And speaking of which — I'm quite popular with the children!
Chikya: I know everything there is to know about phlogiston, and the more I understand, the more in awe of it I am. But the more awe I feel, the more regret and frustration I feel for not being able to wield it myself.
Chikya: *sigh* It was all thanks to you that we were able to make it through all those trials. I understand that to learn skills like our ancestors did, sacrifices must be made...
Chikya: But I simply don't have that kind of courage. Perhaps that's why I can't use phlogiston, haha...
Paimon: Chikya...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr...
Chikya: It's alright, I came to terms with it a long time ago. If it doesn't work this time, there's always next time. I'll find a way eventually!
Chikya: #Thank you so much... I'm grateful for everything you've done for me, {NICKNAME}. I know I keep saying it, but you have a fine future ahead of you, {M#lad}{F#lass}. Not only are you amazingly talented, but you're so kind as well.
Chikya: #Unlike me, for whom everything seems to be set in place now... {M#Lad}{F#Lass}, I'm sure you'll have many more incredible adventures to look forward to.
Chikya: I'm a little jealous, to be honest!
Chikya: #{NICKNAME}, {M#young lad}{F#young lass} full of promise — wherever the road takes you, may your travels be smooth, forever and always!
Traveler: And the same to you...
Traveler: I'm sure you'll achieve your aspirations!
Paimon: Even if there's no "elixir that can cure all injuries," Paimon's sure you'll find an "elixir that can cure your injuries"!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Chikya: #Haha... Thank you Paimon, {NICKNAME}... and last but not least, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}.
Chikya: #...Your words have genuinely moved me, {NICKNAME}. Really, I'm touched by what you've said, {M#lad}{F#lass} —because you're someone that people can count on.
Chikya: Alright, let me rest here a while longer. This hot spring's mighty relaxing, after all. I'll soak in here for a bit, then get back to poring through ancient scrolls for a cure...
Chikya: *sigh* I might be in for a scolding for running off from home, though...
Chikya: #But just as you said, {M#lad}{F#lass}, I'll have to work hard to achieve my aspirations!
Traveler: Have you learned how to use phlogiston?

## Talk 2

Paimon: So this is the Upper Sanctum, huh... From down below, you'd think it was all gray and empty up here...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: Who'd have thought it would be like this...
Chikya: Indeed. It is said that the floating matter here is held together by the power of phlogiston, itself a highly vigorous energy source... It's a strange phenomenon, but that's the best way to understand it for now.
Chikya: This also explains not only why grass and flowers grow above it, but also how it warms cooled earth anew, and ignites a conflagration of souls in the darkness.
Chikya: This is the phlogiston... Won for us by the Sage of the Stolen Flame, snatched from the very claws of the giant dragon.
Chikya: Hmph, and speaking of which, that reminds me... When some people in the tribe lay eyes upon the Upper Sanctum...
Chikya: ...They have the nerve to doubt that a mere human could create such floating islands through the power of phlogiston, thus concluding that the Sage of the Stolen Flame must have been a kind of dragon too.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr?
Traveler: They actually believe that?
Chikya: Just because they couldn't do it themselves, they insist that anyone who could must've been superhuman. I'd rather not hang around with people who have such a losing mentality.
Paimon: Uhh, anyway, what about the treasure and the elixir?
Paimon: Given that's what we've come for, it doesn't look like there's much for us here!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr...
Chikya: Hehe, you didn't actually think this was going to be that simple, did you? We're being put to the test by the "mad" Sage of the Stolen Flame, after all.
Chikya: If the ancient scrolls are right, we must find some mechanisms to activate, complete the final trial, and then reach the center of the Upper Sanctum...
Chikya: But I have no more idea than you as to what this so-called center is supposed to look like. Thinking back, I'm sure the images of the floating islands I've seen before were a bit different from what we're seeing now...
Chikya: But it's possible that as I've aged, even my memory — which I was once so proud of — is becoming unreliable. Anyway... seeing as we've come this far, let's rely on our intuition instead!
Traveler: So, how are we going to activate these mechanisms?
Chikya: Hmm... You should be able to activate them using phlogiston, just like with Phlogiston Engraving?
Chikya: That's what's shown in the scrolls, anyhow. Apparently, the Phlogiston Chiseliths all over Natlan were based on the mechanisms here... Making these mechanisms incredible relics in and of themselves.
Chikya: #Well, {M#lad}{F#lass}, you've shown great promise so far, hehe. Time you went and gave it a try, hmm?
Traveler: People are free to think what they want...
Chikya: I understand that changing the way other people think about the world can be nigh-on impossible, but why, if it doesn't drive me up a wall!

## Talk 3

Chikya: Well I never, a hidden island in the center of the Upper Sanctum... *sigh* And there I was, wondering why it looked so different from what I saw in the pictures.
Chikya: So my memory's fine after all. I wouldn't be in charge of looking after all those ancient woven scrolls if it wasn't, hmm?
Paimon: But apart from that even larger rock in the middle, there's nothing else here... Or could this giant rock itself be the Sage's legendary gift?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr?
Chikya: ...At this point, I'm genuinely stumped. In all the scrolls I've seen, when the heroes pass the trial and reach this place, they should sense the spirit of the Sage of the Stolen Flame.
Chikya: As long as you've reached this place by passing the trial, you're supposed to feel as if you're being called, somehow.
Chikya: But I've no idea what that means in practice. I was under the impression that I'd be able to work that out once I got here, that I could... *sigh* Looks like that was wishful thinking...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr... Rawr?
Traveler: #Huh... {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}, are you seeing this?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: Then... Do you know what it means?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr...
Chikya: #You... saw something? You saw something!? Gracious me! So the one worthy of the gift was you after all, {M#young lad}{F#young lass}?
Paimon: Huh? Paimon didn't see anything either... Weird.
Traveler: I saw a golden pattern...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Rawr!
Paimon: #A golden pattern? You mean, the same one you saw the first time you met {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}?
Paimon: Wait, Paimon thought you were just seeing things back there!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Rawr!
Paimon: #{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}, telling Paimon to look up's no use, she can't see it! But seeing as you've said it's there...
Traveler: The tone sounds familiar too...
Paimon: So maybe the one that left it behind was the Sage of the Stolen Flame?
Chikya: What, what? You mean to say that you've previously been given a sign by the Sage of the Stolen Flame...?
Chikya: #I said you had a bright future ahead of you, {M#lad}{F#lass}, and what lies before you now, but a future oh so radiant? I knew you showed great promise — I wouldn't have taken a shine to you otherwise! So, have you figured out how to receive the gift?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: Yes, I just have to...
Black Screen Text: The stone tablet starts to reverberate with a loud rumbling sound.
As the earth trembles, the giant rock on the ground reveals its true form...
Traveler: (Reach out towards the giant stone tablet...)
Traveler: It's definitely the same person that left that golden pattern before...

## Talk 4

Paimon: Whew, this should be the last mechanism...
Paimon: This one's no different from the others. Chikya, you sure you haven't fallen for some kind of trick?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr...
Chikya: Of course not! When it comes to deciphering ancient scrolls, I have great confidence... some confidence... well, a certain degree of confidence in my abilities!
Paimon: Your confidence is shrinking by the second! Gah, help!
Chikya: Anyway, I'm fairly sure this isn't the last mechanism. If I remember rightly, it should be larger and... more complete?
Traveler: "Floating islands"...
Chikya: #{M#Young lad}{F#Young lass}, irrespective of the great promise you've shown, no one will understand you unless you speak in full sentences.
Chikya: ...As for whether the treasure is real, and the elixir really exists... Well, you'll only know once you've given it a try.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Chikya: If it doesn't work this time, it'll work the next; and if not here, then somewhere else. As long as you stay in the game, a miracle's bound to happen sooner or later!
Traveler: Your optimism truly knows no bounds.
Chikya: I'll take that as a compliment!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Chikya: #Hehe, see, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}'s excited too. Come on then, {NICKNAME}, use phlogiston to activate the mechanism!
Traveler: If we can motivate ourselves to keep trying, that'll be a miracle in itself...
Chikya: We'll have none of that kind of negativity here!
