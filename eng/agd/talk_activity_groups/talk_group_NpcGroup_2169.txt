Yanbo: Hello there!

## Talk

Traveler: How have things been lately?
Yanbo: Alright. We got quite a bit done here. The Chasm should be much safer now.

Traveler: What did you get out of this?
Yanbo: What did we get, huh. Well, we found a lot of raw ore, food, and daily necessities, which we think were bought at low prices from Liyue Harbor.
Yanbo: We originally thought that the foodstuffs and daily necessities had to be some cover for trading other more dangerous goods, but neither investigation nor interrogation has gotten us anywhere.
Yanbo: It seems that they really were just selling foodstuffs to the Fatui, which is very strange...

## Talk

Traveler: Maybe the Fatui really need food?
Yanbo: That... doesn't seem all that believable. Unless...

## Talk

Traveler: Unless...?
Yanbo: Nothing, really. I don't believe that the Fatui would make such a huge fuss over foodstuffs. You've also faced them before â€” I'm sure you know that they aren't simple opponents to deal with. These devious fellows must have some other goal in mind.
Yanbo: Whatever the case, it seems that we have foiled their scheme. Thanks for your help. The Millelith will not forget it.
