# Talk Dialog

Ramiz: Grandma, look, look! Sumeru City is just as lively as Setaria said!
Kulsoom: But of course! Don't run too fast, or I might not be able to keep up, you know.
Ramiz: Don't worry, I won't! There's so much to see here, I wanna take my time to take it all in.
Kulsoom: Hehe... He's every bit as serious about having fun as he is about studying.
Kulsoom: That's good, very good. Conscientious people are successful, no matter what they do.
Ramiz: Grandma, can I ask you for another favor? Could you take me to the Akademiya?
Kulsoom: Of course, of course! Still, it's uphill much of the way, so I might have to ask for your support too.
Ramiz: No problem! Thank you so much, Grandma!
