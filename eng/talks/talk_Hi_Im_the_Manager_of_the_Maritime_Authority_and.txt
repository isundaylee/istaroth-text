Nervous An: Hi! I'm the Manager of the Maritime Authority, and I'm in a fantastic mood right now!
Nervous An: Mmm, feel that sea breeze... Go on, close your eyes and just feel it for a second... Do you it feel it too?
Nervous An: ...Freedom! Hahahaha!
Nervous An: No more fishing boats and cargo ships trying to get in and out of the harbor; no more application forms and approval forms... For a few days, I can forget all about it!
Nervous An: Praise be to the Lord of Geo!
