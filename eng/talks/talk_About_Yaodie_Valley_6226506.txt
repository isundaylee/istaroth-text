Traveler: About Yaodie Valley...
Xuanfu: Honestly, though, I don't know much about Yaodie Valley. I've only heard the village elders mention it.
Xuanfu: According to them, the valley is full of butterflies, and Herblord's abode is hidden deep within.
Xuanfu: Herblord is fond of peace and quiet, so I haven't attempted to explore the place, and don't know what it's like there.
