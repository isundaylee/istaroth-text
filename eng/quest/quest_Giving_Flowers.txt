# Giving Flowers


## Talk 1

Varsha: Wow, there are so many Sweet Flowers!
Paimon: Don't run so fast, Varsha!
Varsha: The flowers are coming along very well here!
Varsha: #Come on over, Paimon! You too, {NICKNAME}!
Paimon: #Varsha just can't sit still for even a second... Let's go, {NICKNAME}.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Strange, what's this kid doing here? Hey kid! Why are you here all alone?
Varsha: Ah! A weird person, and a weird flying person.
Paimon: Hey, hey! That's rude!
Varsha: Yeah, that's right. Rude's my middle name. Didn't even have parents to teach me "manners," don'cha know?
Traveler: (There's a story behind this for sure...)
Paimon: Hmm... Anyway, we aren't weird people, and we definitely aren't bad guys.
Traveler: We're just a pair of kind travelers.
Paimon: Exactly. And that's why we don't leave those who are troubled behind.
Paimon: #Paimon's name is Paimon, and this is {NICKNAME}. Might we know your name?
Varsha: My name's Varsha...
Paimon: And why are you here all alone, Varsha? We can escort you back if you're lost.
Varsha: No. The past should stay in the past. I've decided to move on.
Paimon: Eh?
Varsha: I can't rely on adults. I must go my own way...
Paimon: What's with this old-person talk...? You are just a kid! Anyway, the forest can be pretty dangerous. A kid like you isn't gonna be able to handle it.
Varsha: Some bad guy tried to take me away earlier... But it's okay. I'm more careful now. I'll be able to avoid danger.
Varsha: He was a guy from Vimara Village, and he looked nice enough. But as it turns out, he was no different from those adults I met before...
Paimon: You almost got taken away by some bad guy!? You haven't learned your lesson at all, then! Wait, and how did you manage to get away last time, anyway?
Varsha: Some small creature whisked me to this place. I've never seen something this small in Gandharva Ville, so I believe that it had to be a forest spirit.
Traveler: (It could be an Aranara.)
Paimon: (That said, could "that guy from Vimara Village" refer to...)
Paimon: Anyway, it's still not safe for kids to be alone in the forest. You might encounter all kinds of dangers, like...
Traveler: Running into dangerous Fungi.
Paimon: Yeah! And villains such as Nara Marana. Ugh, no, Paimon meant to say...
Traveler: You might run into bad guys that might try to kidnap you.
Paimon: #Yup! What {NICKNAME} said! Or... or you might starve!
Varsha: It's impossible to starve in a forest full of nature's gifts. Starshrooms, Sweet Flowers, and Mints are everywhere, and I eat like a bird anyway.
Varsha: And I've always been pretty good at taking care of plants, so finding a safe place to plant some Sweet Flowers or Mints to feed myself won't be a problem.
Varsha: Haha, a garden full of Sweet Flowers... Wouldn't that be paradise?
Paimon: What a sweet daydream she's having, eh...
Varsha: Anyway, I am much happier now than when I was in Gandharva Ville, and I don't get beaten... I appreciate your kindness. But right now, it'd be for the best if you left me alone...
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon doesn't know what she's been through, but it seems like it would be hard to convince her to return.
Paimon: To be fair, things don't look too dangerous around here... Let's come back and see her later if chance allows. Maybe she'll have changed her mind by then.
Traveler: #We're looking for my lost {F#brother}{M#sister}...
Paimon: Yes. So of course we got worried when we saw a little girl like you here all alone! We just can't leave you like this knowing that you might need help.

## Talk 3

Varsha: As long as there are seeds, I can grow more Sweet Flowers. But bread is different. You can't plant bread.
Varsha: If bread could break in half and grow back again, no one would ever go hungry...

## Talk 4

Paimon: Hi Varsha! You're still here, huh?
Varsha: #Paimon. {NICKNAME}. Good to see you. I'm doing well here. There's nothing for you to worry about.
Paimon: You've persevered, huh...
Varsha: Are you still trying to persuade me? I'm not going anywhere with you. Not at all...
Paimon: Well... we're not gonna force you to do anything. Remember what you said about "a garden full of Sweet Flowers"?
Varsha: Ah... It was a wishful thinking actually. I know there isn't such a place.
Paimon: Hmm... This maturity still feels weird coming from a kid.
Paimon: Guess what? We've got good news!
Traveler: There really is a garden full of Sweet Flowers.
Paimon: Yes! And believe it or not, the "forest spirit" that saved you is from a species called Aranara.
Paimon: We know this, 'cause we've helped plant many Viparyas for them.
Traveler: We helped the earth to remember.
Paimon: That's right. According to Aranakula, Vanarana remembers everything, so the Viparyas can sprout in the garden once the land remembers them again.
Varsha: ...I've heard a lot of stories like this before, and only kids take them seriously. But I know you said this with good intentions, Paimon, so thank you.
Paimon: Aren't you a kid as well? And Paimon's not telling stories. Paimon means it for real!
Varsha: Yeah. That's what every storyteller says.
Paimon: If you don't believe us... Well, seeing is believing! Come with us and see for yourself!
Varsha: Wait, you've really prepared a place to fit your story? Now I'm getting curious.
Paimon: Ugh, Paimon's telling you the truth...
Paimon: #Let's take her to the Aranara's garden, {NICKNAME}. That should silence her doubts once and for all.

## Talk 5

Varsha: #Did you prepare all this, Paimon and {NICKNAME}?
Paimon: Ugh... Yes and no. It's Aranakula and Arakara who tend to this garden together. We just helped out a little on the side. It is not built just for made-up stories.
Varsha: Aranakula and Arakara... They are the "Aranara," the forest spirits?
Paimon: Yes! You finally believe Paimon now? Not only did we help to take care of the garden, but we also went on adventures with the Aranara!
Paimon: The Aranara are the ones who take the kidnapped kids back to Vimara Village.
Varsha: It's still hard to believe the stories though... But if I stay here, will I have a chance to see them too?
Paimon: Vanarana is not actually dangerous, but are you sure you don't want to go back to Gandharva Ville?
Varsha: You have a memory like a sieve, Paimon. I said I couldn't rely on adults and that I want to go my own way.
Traveler: But...
Varsha: Alright, don't worry about me. I've managed to live on my own so far, remember?
Varsha: And I am a great caretaker of plants. The Aranara would be happy to see the garden flourishing here!
Paimon: Well, if you insist...
Varsha: You're such a worrywart, Paimon. No one has cared about me this much for as long as I can remember.
Paimon: Uh... Listen here, Varsha, you are safe here in Vanarana. But you are still a kid, so please take care of yourself.
Varsha: I know, I know. You two take care as well!

Varsha: Haha, a garden full of Sweet Flowers... Wouldn't that be paradise?
Paimon: A garden full of Sweet Flowers, huh... Ooh, Paimon remembers that there were many in the garden we took care of for the Aranara!
Varsha: Wait. Are you saying that there really is a paradise like that out there, Paimon?
Paimon: Yup! And believe it or not, the "forest spirit" that saved you is from a species called the Aranara.
