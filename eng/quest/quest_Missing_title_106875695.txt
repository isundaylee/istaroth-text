Paimon: That's great. In a way, everyone who has pursued the "Lunar Leviathan" can be regarded as having their wishes fulfilled.
Traveler: Are you all done?
Paimon: You see you see, hasn't Jiawei found a healthy wife?
Paimon: Nantuck also became a reputable author because of the book on the "Lunar Leviathan," although its contents are wrong.
Paimon: Kujirai Momiji became the most well-known fisherwoman in Inazuma and did what her father could not — catching the "Lunar Leviathan."
Paimon: #So Paimon feels, Traveler's will come true too! Tee-hee!
Traveler: What did Paimon wish for just now?
Paimon: Can't say! Can't say! If Paimon says it out loud, it won't come true!
Traveler: The "Lunar Leviathan" won't be that stingy.
Paimon: Hmmm— Ok, listen carefully! Paimon will only say it once!
Paimon: Paimon's wish is for your wish to come true.
Traveler: I didn't hear you, what did you say?
Paimon: Hmph, Paimon isn't going to repeat herself! Paimon wants to get some candy~ Lalala~
