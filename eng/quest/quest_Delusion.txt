# Delusion


## Talk 1

Sangonomiya Kokomi: #How is Teppei's condition, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: How could none of us have noticed?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: ...I have put out the order to seize all Delusions.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The vast majority are showing some loss of vitality, but nothing serious.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Sadly, a few have been... less fortunate...
Gorou: Your Excellency, I'm planning to establish a dedicated field hospital to monitor their condition.
Gorou: The soldiers are up in arms about the ban though. They know full well what a Delusion is, but they still intend to keep using them.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Okay. I'll leave you to deal with this situation. I have to get to the front line.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: This whole fiasco is certain to be a blow to morale. If the Shogun's Army attacks now, while we're scrambling to recover, it could well undo everything we have achieved so far.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: #{NICKNAME}, what are your thoughts?
Traveler: I'll go confront the Fatui directly.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: No, it's too dangerous!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The Sakoku Decree is still in force, so their Delusions must be produced within Inazuma's borders.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: To organize an operation of this scale, they will have had to mobilize a huge amount of manpower and resources. They can't have done it without local support.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: If we want to stop them, we have to destroy the factory where the Delusions are made. But it's sure to be heavily guarded...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It's dangerous to go alone. At least take some troops with you...
Traveler: There's no time for that.
Gorou: Your Excellency, given the urgency of the situation, we were hardly discreet when confiscating the Delusions. The Fatui are sure to take notice.
Gorou: If we spend any longer amassing our forces, they will get wind of our plans and make their escape.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Very true. Mm... let me think...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I gave this some thought while you were confiscating the Delusions. The site of the factory must be big and secluded, but close enough to a transport route to ensure the supply of raw materials...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Not many places meet these criteria, and if we take the locations where our soldiers received their Delusions into account as well, I suspect the site is likely to be the cliffs near the ocean at the southwest of <color=#00E1FFFF>Yashiori Island</color>.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I'm not going to stop you, but please be careful.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: We have lost too many courageous fighters already. I don't want to lose you too.
Traveler: Okay, let's go.
Paimon: Huh? You mean, to the <color=#00E1FFFF>Delusion factory</color>?
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Really? You aren't going to think it over first? Ugh, fine...
Traveler: He's taken a sudden turn for the worse.

## Talk 2

The Balladeer: You actually managed to find this place. Congratulations.
The Balladeer: Hah. Barely two words in and you already look like you want me dead.
Traveler: You're manufacturing Delusions...
The Balladeer: Oh, so that's what this is about.
The Balladeer: I think you've got the wrong idea. I know how this looks, but I'm just here to follow orders.
The Balladeer: I'm obviously not the mastermind behind this. Aren't you supposed to be pretty tough? What are you waiting for, go get them.
The Balladeer: You're getting all worked up over nothing. Pff, you've changed... You're getting weak.
Paimon: How can you say this is nothing?
The Balladeer: How can you call it anything more? It's the way of the world. Human life is worthless.
The Balladeer: They were always going to die, with or without a Delusion. At least having one gives them a chance to fulfill their ambitions.
The Balladeer: Do you have any idea how useful the Vision Hunt Decree is to us? It took a lot of work to make it happen. Obviously it was in our best interests.
The Balladeer: Good news is, our hard work is finally paying off. Generating conflict creates a big market for Delusions. Now we just let the promise of power draw in the weak...
The Balladeer: For just a small price, they get the feeling of controlling the world. Trading their life for supreme power... pretty good deal, don't you think?
Paimon: So the Fatui started the Vision Hunt Decree? You've been behind it all along?
The Balladeer: From the outside, Inazuma looks pretty impenetrable, but on the inside... it's a land of opportunity. With a little effort, we were able to break them down from within.
The Balladeer: Eternity stretches things out over a long time. But each moment within it becomes all the more fragile.
The Balladeer: Take your friend in the resistance, for example. There's nothing you can do now. He's a lost cause.
The Balladeer: Just like a bubble on the water. Beautiful for a moment, then total destruction.
The Balladeer: The more it takes from them, the more tightly they hold onto it. And the more incompetent they are, the more determined they are to fight it! Hahaha, it's such a farce, you have to see the funny side.
Traveler: Don't you dare mock Teppei...
Paimon: #Hey! {NICKNAME}, calm down...
Traveler: He's not incompetent!
Traveler: You're giving Delusions to the resistance...

## Talk 3

The Balladeer: You actually managed to find this place. Congratulations.
Paimon: So you're another Fatui Harbinger... like Signora and Childe?
The Balladeer: Signora and Childe? Huh... I didn't know you and my two least reliable colleagues were acquainted.
The Balladeer: I'm The Balladeer, No. 6 of the Fatui Harbingers. Delighted to meet you, O Mighty Traveler.
Traveler: You're manufacturing Delusions...
Traveler: You're giving Delusions to the resistance...
The Balladeer: So many visitors today. To what do I owe the honor?
The Balladeer: Oh, so that's what this is about.
The Balladeer: I think you've got the wrong idea. I know how this looks, but I'm just here to follow orders.
The Balladeer: I'm obviously not the mastermind behind this. Aren't you supposed to be pretty tough? What are you waiting for, go get them.
The Balladeer: You're getting all worked up over nothing. Huh... didn't have you down as being so weak.
Paimon: How can you say this is nothing?
The Balladeer: How can you call it anything more? It's the way of the world. Human life is worthless.
The Balladeer: They were always going to die, with or without a Delusion. At least having one gives them a chance to fulfill their ambitions.
