Traveler: Mind telling me a bit about yourself?
Nathan: Me? Ehh, I'm just an ordinary person from Mondstadt. I've never gotten any training, nor was I a knight.
Nathan: If you've been to Mondstadt, you'd know that we lead a very laid back lifestyle.
Nathan: Personally, I can't accept the Shogunate's ways of stripping others of their freedom. That's the reason why I'm so concerned about the current situation.
Nathan: Still, it's not like I've made a huge difference by joining the Sangonomiya faction either. I just try to help out as much as I can, haha.
