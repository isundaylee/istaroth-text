Traveler: I've got some treasure I want to sell.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Eh? Well, to tell you the truth, we've managed to restore a regular supply of goods, and we don't really make collecting odds and ends a habit, in any case...
Mikoshi Genichirou: But just from looking at you, I think it's safe to assume that it's something most interesting indeed.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Well... Why don't you let me have a look at it, then?
Black Screen Text: You tell Mikoshi Genichirou about the Dragonbone Orb.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Hmm...
Mikoshi Genichirou: I'll be honest with you. While this is quite the curious tale, it does seem a bit too out there...
Mikoshi Genichirou: This object falls somewhat outside my area of expertise.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Please, don't scoff. I am but a mere craftsman myself...
Mikoshi Genichirou: How about this, then? 80,000 and 5 Sashimi Platters. Those dishes aren't cheap by any means, mind you.
Mikoshi Genichirou: If you agree to this price, I will buy this treasure.
Traveler: ...What will you use it for?
Mikoshi Genichirou: I'm not sure at the moment. I'll need to give it some thought.
Mikoshi Genichirou: If the situation is right, I might be able to modify this into a special netsuke and sell it for a decent price.
Traveler: A fair price. Done.
Mikoshi Genichirou: In that case, please take this Mora. As for me, I'm going to go look into this item.
Traveler: Let me think about it a bit more.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Fair enough. I need to give this a little thought myself.
Mikoshi Genichirou: You can come to me again once you've thought things over.

Traveler: About the Dragonbone Orb...
Mikoshi Genichirou: Have you decided to sell me the Dragonbone Orb, then?
Mikoshi Genichirou: The price is the same as before. 80,000 Mora and 5 Sashimi Platters.
Traveler: It's yours, then.
Mikoshi Genichirou: In that case, please take this Mora. As for me, I'm going to go look into this item.
Traveler: Let me think about it one more time.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Fair enough. I need to give this a little thought myself.
Mikoshi Genichirou: You can come to me again once you've thought things over.

Traveler: I'd like to buy a few things...
Mikoshi Genichirou: Let me see what you need, dear customer...
Mikoshi Genichirou: Ah, my sincere apologies, but we are still in the midst of arranging for the goods that you require.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Our capacities are limited, and it will take some time for the goods to be restocked, so please do come again then.

Traveler: Tell me about your store...
Mikoshi Genichirou: You mean where the name of this store came from?
Mikoshi Genichirou: Haha, I see you're not from Inazuma.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Netsuke is a kind of small craftwork that the Inazumans carry with them as pendants. Generally, they are carved into different shapes based on the owner's preference.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Take this one for instance. If you cross the rope from the inner side of the belt and then hang a coin pouch, seal or stamp on it, the netsuke will be stuck onto the belt. Convenient, eh?
Mikoshi Genichirou: As for the "Gen" part of the name... Well, it's my name, actually.

Traveler: What can you make to order?
Mikoshi Genichirou: What would you like? Just tell me, and I will do my best to make it happen.
Mikoshi Genichirou: This store may not be as famous as those old family stores on this street, but we are still proud of our fine craftsmanship.
Mikoshi Genichirou: To be honest, I'm actually the eldest son of my family, but people always say that I am simple and dull, and that I probably won't be able to carry on with the family business.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Haha, that's why I would rather start a small store here and help the neighbors out with my handiwork.
