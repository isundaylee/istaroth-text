Lisette: Where should I adventure next?

## Talk

Traveler: Adventure, you say?
Lisette: That's right. My adventure here's been awesome! Everyone treats me well, especially the people at the Spina di Rosula.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Lisette: Yup, seeya!

## Talk

Traveler: You're not from around here originally?
Lisette: Um, I... don't really remember.
Lisette: One day, when I woke up, I was... just here. Maybe Mom and Dad abandoned me, or something...

## Talk

Traveler: That wasn't your fault.
Lisette: I know. Everyone here tells me that too.
Lisette: Everyone here is super friendly, and I'm living really well. Even if I don't go back... I mean, I'd be totally okay staying here forever!
