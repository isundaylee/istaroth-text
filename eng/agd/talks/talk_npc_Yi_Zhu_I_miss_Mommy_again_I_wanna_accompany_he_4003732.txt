Yi Xian: Yi Zhu, I miss Mommy again... I wanna accompany her to see the Xiao Market...
Yi Zhu: Don't cry, Xian... I'll go with you this year, alright?
Yi Zhu: Let's go buy some toys, check out the Xiao Lanterns, and watch the fireworks. I'll carry you on my back if you get tired.
Yi Xian: Yi Zhu... *sobs*
Yi Xian: Then... will you teach me how to make Xiao Lanterns this year? I'd like to make Mommy one.
Yi Zhu: Of course I can. We made one for her together last year. This year, I'll teach you, and you'll be able to make one yourself!
Yi Xian: Yep!
Yi Zhu: When Mommy sees your Xiao Lantern, her spirit will return, together with all those other heroes. Then, we'll welcome her back with big smiles on our faces!
Yi Xian: Yeah!
