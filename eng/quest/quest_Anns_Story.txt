# Ann's Story


## Talk 1

Traveler: Déjà vu, perhaps?
Paimon: Huh. Y'know, Paimon thought that she hadn't fully woken up yet... But haven't these things happened before?

## Talk 2

Paimon: That's a...
Traveler: "Fell Shield of Narcissus"?
Paimon: Haha. That name does fit our adventure up till now, huh?
Ann: This is the center of the world. The castle where the dragon lurks, the tower that imprisons the Princess. Sometimes, it is the lost Ancient City of Ys. Sometimes, Arcadia. At times, it is even golden Hyperborea.
Ann: Here, many untrodden realms have been conquered. Here, many heroes have defeated evil dragons.
Ann: This is a place that brims with magic, and I was never really able to understand it. Children could see, through a stone wall, the imaginary griffins that whirl freely in the distant cloud-filled skies.
Ann: These four pools would, in different adventure tales, be the four seas, and sometimes the four cardinal realms of the world.
Ann: I could not understand these things either, but to accompany the children on their adventures, I played all sorts of roles.
Paimon: Are these more of those suddenly-emerging memories?
Ann: ...Yes.
Paimon: Hmm. Ann, are you alright?
Ann: I don't know. I feel very strange. These memories are so beautiful, but terrifying, too.
Ann: Look, there, atop that small fountain. That is the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz.
Paimon: Is it really? It looks, uh, kinda cheap.
Traveler: Behold, Paimon, the holy blade!
Paimon: Seriously? It's just a shabby wooden sword! Still...
Paimon: With this sword in hand, Paimon bets the kids sure felt like invincible heroes, ready to take to the skies and do battle with their enemies, huh!
Ann: Appropriately-shaped branches and drying poles could also, in the right tale, be the holy blade.
Ann: But she... One day, a certain woman brought several wooden swords for the children to play with, so that the drying poles would stop being used in fights.
Paimon: ...And who was that?
Ann: I do not know. It must have been someone who once lived here...
Paimon: Yeah, it does seem like the kingdom was once a lively place, with all sorts of people in it!
Paimon: When you think about it like that, the Holy Blade must've been very important.
Ann: A normal sword can cleave flesh, but the Holy Blade can cleave spirit and will.
Ann: As such, even impervious dragons and formless illusions are no match for it.
Ann: If the story of our adventure team is to reach its end, we will need the blade.
Paimon: Is it really that powerful? It just looks like a cheap wooden sword...
Traveler: Just take its holiness at face value.
Paimon: Sure, if you say so... But it doesn't look like we can reach it right now.
Paimon: Let's continue exploring. Maybe we'll find some way to break this magical bubble.
Traveler: It's like that time with the Sword of Brilliant Valor...
Paimon: Ooh, okay, Paimon gets it. It is the tale behind the blade and one's belief in it that makes it a holy blade, right?
Traveler: It seems like some sort of seal...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Huh? What...
Paimon: What is this place?
Ann: This is the real "Annapausis."

## Talk 4

Paimon: Actually, why is there a Bubble Formation here too? Was this meant to prevent invaders from kidnapping the Princess?
Ann: ...Yes. That is the case.
Paimon: Also, we ran into some enemies earlier. Didn't you say that when Princess Lyris gave you her treasure, the tower stagnated, and even Narcissus could not enter?
Paimon: There's... a lot of stuff here that doesn't make sense. What's going on?
Ann: I don't know either. I never thought about what would happen after we entered the tower.
Ann: Also, this place feels very strange. I don't understand. I should never have been here before, but I find myself... recalling, feeling many things.
Ann: Do you two not feel it?
Traveler: No.
Paimon: Paimon doesn't either...
Ann: Hmmm...
Paimon: Well, do you know what place this is, Ann?
Ann: This was the assembly hall of the Narzissenkreuz Institute. The children would study here normally. I remember now. This was a lovely place. There was no sunlight, but it was always lively here.
Ann: The children were all of different dimensions — some of them as different as the two of you. But here, they would study together, listen to tales of the Hydro Archon... and to tales older still.
Traveler: Dimensions?
Ann: I mean that some children were very small, and some were somewhat larger.
Paimon: Hey now! Paimon might be small, but she's got a big heart!
Paimon: A—Anyway... What about the Princess? Was she a child, too? Would the children hear stories about her?
Ann: I... I don't know.
Paimon: Huh.
Paimon: Why does Paimon get the feeling that the story's started drifting away from the Princess ever since we teleported here?
Ann: No, this place must have something to do with her.
Ann: We must be able to find her at the end of this road. She will be happy to see us.
Paimon: Well, you're the local. Paimon trusts you!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Hehe, finally! The Holy Blade is ours!

## Talk 6

Paimon: It doesn't look like much, but once its powers are awakened, it will become a destructive and invincible weapon!
Paimon: #How is it, Traveler? Can you feel its power?
Traveler: Uogh! Unlimited power...
Paimon: Ooh!
Traveler: ...Comes not from this blade.
Paimon: Wh—What? C'mon, you had Paimon going there...
Paimon: Come to think of it, Ann, you did mention that the Holy Blade was originally a wooden sword that kids played with...
Ann: That's right. When the young heroes from the Narzissenkreuz Adventure Team would pick this sword up, they would become able to defeat all foes in their tale.
Paimon: ...Well, let's just take this sword, shall we? Who knows, it might come in handy later — and if not, we can take it as a souvenir.
Traveler: Hmm...
Traveler: This really is just a wooden toy sword.

## Talk 7

Traveler: Is this a library?
Paimon: Wait a minute. Is it just that Paimon hasn't fully woken up yet, or is it déjà vu? Haven't these things already happened before?

## Talk 8

Traveler: "Someone" wants this tale of adventure to never end.
Paimon: #Eh? What are you on about, Traveler?
Paimon: Huh. You know what? Paimon thought that she hadn't fully woken up yet... But haven't these things happened before?
Traveler: But the future of a story that constantly repeats will never come.
Ann: Yes...
Traveler: Princess Lyris waits at the end of this path.
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon knows! The last time we were here, you said "On the other hand, we'll be able to leave as long as we find the end of the road," didn't you?
Paimon: Hmm... Then there must be a way!
Traveler: But we must keep moving forward.

## Talk 9

Traveler: Déjà vu, perhaps?
Paimon: Huh. Y'know, Paimon thought that she hadn't fully woken up yet... But haven't these things happened before?

## Talk 10

Rather Aged Records: "...Decided to incorporate the institute for raising orphans and the children of criminals into the public welfare system. Considering the ruins of a previous civilization upon which it is situated, it shall be named..."
Rather Aged Records: "...The seat of Director was established in honor of the Hydro Archon's great virtue, and has been taken on by a gentle-natured Oceanid. The title of Vice Director is to be taken up by one who displays exceptional moral quality and ability..."

## Talk 11

Ann: This is the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz.

## Talk 12

Paimon: Paimon's... kinda... dizzy. There are so many books here...
Traveler: We already have the Holy Blade.
Paimon: #Eh? What are you on about, Traveler?
Paimon: ...
Paimon: Wait, we really do have it. When did that happen?
Paimon: Huh. You know what? Paimon thought that she hadn't fully woken up yet... But she definitely remembers that we came here before!
Traveler: It's time to enter the next part of the story.
Ann: But... We don't know what will happen next...
Traveler: Well, Princess Lyris waits at the end of this path.
Traveler: Do you believe that?
Ann: I do.
Ann: Yes! That has to be true. Apart from saving the Princess... apart from that one wish, I have nothing at all. I'll do anything to fulfill it!
Paimon: Ann...
Traveler: In that case, let's do this for Princess Lyris.
Traveler: Believe in me and Paimon. Let's go.
Traveler: I am your knight, after all.
Paimon: That's right! We're here to help you, Ann — we're your super reliable helpers!
Paimon: You've gotta believe in us. Also, the Princess is waiting!
Ann: Yes. I believe in the two of you.
Traveler: I do want to finish this journey, after all.
Traveler: In that case, let's do this to achieve your goal, Ann.

## Talk 13

Paimon: Looks like the path leads downward rather than forward...
Paimon: This is a really long descent...
Ann: It's so creepy...
Paimon: #Don't worry, Ann. Traveler's really reliable — and really good with a wind glider, too!
Ann: But... We don't know what will happen next...
Traveler: Well, Princess Lyris waits at the end of this path.
Traveler: Do you believe that?
Ann: I do.
Ann: Yes! That has to be true. Apart from saving the Princess... apart from that one wish, I have nothing at all. I'll do anything to fulfill it!
Paimon: Ann...
Traveler: In that case, let's do this for Princess Lyris.
Traveler: Believe in me and Paimon. Let's go.
Traveler: I am your knight, after all.
Paimon: That's right! We're here to help you, Ann — we're your super reliable helpers!
Paimon: Believe in us! Also, Paimon thinks that...
Paimon: A real adventure is not only filled with challenges, but also with unknowns. The most important thing is to come back from completing those challenges and unknowns in one piece, and gain something in the end as well. Right?
Ann: Yes...
Ann: #I believe in you, Knight Traveler, and in Paimon. You are wise and powerful... and you are also kind people.
Paimon: And ding ding ding, we have a winner! In that case, let's go. "Ad astra abyssosque," as Katheryne always says!
Traveler: I do want to finish this journey, after all.
Traveler: In that case, let's do this to achieve your goal, Ann.

## Talk 14

Paimon: Looks like the path leads downward rather than forward...
Paimon: This is a really long descent...
Ann: It's so creepy...
Paimon: #Don't worry, Ann. Traveler's really reliable — and really good with a wind glider, too!
Paimon: Ah, Paimon knows. You're worried about what might come afterward, right? Well, don't be!
Paimon: #A real adventure is not only filled with challenges, but also with unknowns. The most important thing is to come back from completing those challenges and unknowns in one piece, and gain something in the end as well. Isn't that right, Traveler?
Traveler: We've come this far. It would be a shame to give up now.
Ann: True...
Ann: #I believe in you, Knight Traveler, and in Paimon. You are wise and powerful... and you are also kind people.
Paimon: And ding ding ding, we have a winner! In that case, let's go. "Ad astra abyssosque," as Katheryne always says!
Traveler: You did say that Princess Lyris would be just up ahead.

## Talk 15

Ann: There will be another adventure, and another, and another one after that.
Paimon: ...
Paimon: So... Even though the Princess is waiting for us at the end of this road, it's just a bunch of connected loops with no real end?
Traveler: On the other hand...
Traveler: We'll be able to leave as long as we find the end of the road.
Paimon: #Huh? Do you have an idea, Traveler?
Traveler: Any thoughts, Ann?
Ann: I'm sorry. I don't know. I don't know anything about what happens after this...
Traveler: Then let's take stock real quick.
Traveler: Have you noticed anything, Paimon?
Paimon: Eh? You're asking Paimon? Uh, hold on a moment...
Paimon: First, the paths here have been connected such that they form a ring, right? In that case, there'd be no getting out...
Paimon: Except that we were able to get on these paths, so there should be a way off them. There has to be a point from which we can break through.
Paimon: Next, we saw that... super powerful sword, or something.
Ann: Yes, the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz.
Paimon: It should be a key item in some way...
Traveler: And why do you think that?
Paimon: Well, it looks like a wooden sword, but it was inside a protective barrier. Would all that trouble be necessary if it wasn't important?
Paimon: So, Paimon thinks that we need to get that sword!
Traveler: Was there any other notable thing?
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon can't think of anything at the moment...
Paimon: But that said, this tile sticks out like a sore thumb, doesn't it?
Paimon: Paimon didn't just make that one up, by the way! When we passed this way before, it did feel weird how this tile is not connected to the others, and how it has a different pattern.
Paimon: It could be a trap!
Traveler: That's what I was thinking about as well.
Paimon: Hehe, guess Paimon's just as smart as you are, eh?
Ann: But you really do have an impressive mind, Paimon. As for me, my head's a mess. I can't get my thoughts straight...
Paimon: Don't beat yourself up too much! You're being assaulted by strange memories in this place...
Paimon: Anyway, let's think of how we can get out of this loop based on the stuff we thought of earlier!
Traveler: Good work, Paimon.
Paimon: Wait, why are you praising Paimon so seriously all of a sudden? Paimon's not used to this...
Traveler: Let's go over what we know first, then.

## Talk 16

Paimon: Paimon's... kinda... dizzy. There are so many books here...

## Talk 17

Paimon: Hmm... Paimon feels like something should happen right about now...
Ann: I feel uneasy too... And I've been... frightened, ever since we came down here.
Paimon: #No need to worry. Traveler will protect us no matter what, right?
Traveler: Hmm, uh...
Paimon: #Hey! C'mon, you've beaten dragons, Traveler! Have more faith in yourself!
Ann: Yes. I believe in the two of you. I just... don't know what we will encounter later...
Paimon: We'll take anything as it comes!
Paimon: #Still, best to be prepared, Traveler. We might be in for a battle with Narcissus, for all we know!
Traveler: Of course I will.

## Talk 18

Traveler: "Someone" wants this tale of adventure to never end.
Paimon: #Eh? What are you on about, Traveler?
Paimon: Huh. You know what? Paimon thought that she hadn't fully woken up yet... But haven't these things happened before?
Traveler: But the future of a story that constantly repeats will never come.

Paimon: Wait, why are you praising Paimon so seriously all of a sudden? Paimon's not used to this...
Traveler: Let's go over what we know first, then.

## Talk 20

Paimon: So... Why did we meet Narcissus in here?
Ann: ...
Paimon: According to what we said before, the tower lost its "time" and thus stagnated. As such, no one could open it or enter it.
Traveler: But this space is not within the tower.
Traveler: We teleported to a different place from the tower.
Paimon: Huh, that's right! Paimon forgot that that happened... But if that's the case...
Ann: But how... No, that can't be true! The Princess should be in the tower. I mean, that was the adventure team's only hope in this dark world...
Ann: If she isn't... Our adventures... their meaning... Al, Petit Chou, and the others...
Paimon: Ann...
Paimon: But we did take out the biggest threat to the kingdom, didn't we? That's a good thing, right?
Ann: ...Yes, you're right, Paimon. Thank you. Thank you both.
Traveler: Anyway, the story's not over.
Paimon: Yup! Look over there. There's a place we haven't been to before. Maybe we'll find more clues there, huh?

## Talk 21

Traveler: Is this a library?
Paimon: Wait a minute. Is it just that Paimon hasn't fully woken up yet, or is it déjà vu? Haven't these things already happened before?

## Talk 22

Ann: This is the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz.

## Talk 23

Rather Aged Research: "... According to the ancient theater and mysterious research hidden here, we believe that the documents and folklore discovered within Petrichor..."
Rather Aged Research: "...The research team from Institute of Natural Philosophy holds that..."

## Talk 24

Traveler: Is this a bookstore?
Paimon: What makes you think there'd be secret underground bookstore ruins anywhere in Fontaine?
Paimon: Wait a minute. Is it just that Paimon hasn't fully woken up yet, or is it déjà vu? Haven't these things already happened before?

## Talk 25

Paimon: Hmm? There's a book here too...
Traveler: A picture book, huh? It suits you, Paimon.
Paimon: Hmph! Well, that's because of Paimon's unique sensibility, you know? Picture books just speak to her better!
Ann: This book... This book gives me a strange feeling.
Paimon: Let Paimon see...
Paimon: "A long, long time ago, in a place far, far away, there was once a beautiful and kind Princess named Lyris... and yup, she's our main character!"
Ann: "'I don't want this name. That's not what you said before.'"
Paimon: Do you wanna read it too, Ann? In that case, Paimon's gonna continue. Ahem!
Paimon: "Oh, come on, it's just a story, there's no need to be so fussy. Anyway, a protagonist needs an antagonist... an evil one, at that!"
Paimon: "And our evil antagonist... Well, that's the dragon Narcissus. So evil is he that the peace-loving people tremble at the sound of his name — not that he cares about their feelings, though."
Paimon: "He sowed destruction across the land with the searing flames he spewed from his mouth. His great wings turned cities to dust and his burning breath reduced nations to ash."
Paimon: "At last, only the Princess's realm remained safe."
Paimon: "But because the Princess worked tirelessly to defend her realm, Narcissus's plot to destroy everything could not succeed."
Ann: "'So, in Narcissus's story, I'm the evil villain?'"
Paimon: #This is kinda weird. This started like a story book, but it also feels like it isn't... Traveler, you've got the bigger brain here. You have a look too!
Traveler: (Read carefully...)

## Talk 26

Paimon: Paimon's... kinda... dizzy. There are so many books here...

## Talk 27

Paimon: Paimon's... kinda... dizzy. There are so many books here...
Traveler: We already have the Holy Blade.
Paimon: #Eh? What are you on about, Traveler?
Paimon: ...
Paimon: Wait, we really do have it. When did that happen?
Paimon: Huh. You know what? Paimon thought that she hadn't fully woken up yet... But she definitely remembers that we came here before!
Traveler: It's time to enter the next part of the story.
Ann: But... We don't know what will happen next...

Ann: Yes! That has to be true. Apart from saving the Princess... apart from that one wish, I have nothing at all. I'll do anything to fulfill it!
Paimon: Ann...
Traveler: In that case, let's do this for Princess Lyris.
Traveler: Believe in me and Paimon. Let's go.
Traveler: I am your knight, after all.
Paimon: That's right! We're here to help you, Ann — we're your super reliable helpers!
Paimon: You've gotta believe in us. Also, the Princess is waiting!
Ann: Yes. I believe in the two of you.
Traveler: I do want to finish this journey, after all.
Traveler: In that case, let's do this to achieve your goal, Ann.

## Talk 28

Traveler: Is this a bookstore?
Paimon: What makes you think there'd be secret underground bookstore ruins anywhere in Fontaine?
Paimon: Wait a minute. Is it just that Paimon hasn't fully woken up yet, or is it déjà vu? Haven't these things already happened before?

## Talk 29

Paimon: Paimon's... kinda... dizzy. There are so many books here...
Traveler: Is this a library?
Ann: This place... This library has existed since long, long before we arrived.
Ann: Their contents seem to be ancient dramas. Children love to read books, but there is much they won't understand, so they will often ask adults to read the stories to them.
Ann: In the books, where there is an evil dragon, there must be heroes who hunt the dragon. If there is a mage, there must be a wandering knight. The Reconquista must come to pass, and the princess must be saved.
Ann: And of course, a chime will sound, and the tale of adventure will come to a halt.
Ann: Yet it will not end. There will be another adventure, and another, and another one after that, until the children grow up and leave this place.
Paimon: Ann?
Ann: Huh? I... Sorry, it felt like memories and feelings suddenly... flooded into my mind. How strange.
Paimon: Huh. Well, as long as you're alright... Paimon thought you might have been bewitched by Narcissus's magic or something!
Ann: Urk. That might actually be so!
Paimon: Hmmm... Well, what do we do next?
Ann: I'm not sure either...
Traveler: Whatever the case, let's have a look around.
Paimon: Yup. First off... Huh, there's a door over there, but it looks like there's no way through it.
Traveler: You two should be able to get across.
Paimon: Hey, you're Ann's knight right now, you know. This will all be pointless if you don't come along!
Ann: That's right!
Paimon: This tile sticks out like a sore thumb...
Traveler: This might be some sort of path.
Paimon: Paimon doesn't know either... But let's go, all the same!
Traveler: This might be a trap...
Traveler: Is this a bookstore?
Paimon: What makes you think there'd be secret underground bookstore ruins anywhere in Fontaine?
