Carranza: Math isn't just beautiful, it's practical. I wish more people understood that.

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing here?
Carranza: Waiting. I heard a rumor and if it turns out to be true, I will take action.

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry to bother you.
Carranza: Until next time.

## Talk

Traveler: I don't understand what you're talking about...
Carranza: Excellent. I don't want you to understand, because if you did, you would become a rival.
Carranza: But if you really are in desperate need of someone to talk to, we could discuss something else entirely. Something that will not harm anyone's interests. Math, for example...

## Talk

Traveler: That's my cue to leave.
Carranza: I'll see myself out.

## Talk

Carranza: It's important to study during your free time. Studying theater brings only the tiniest of results. It's better to study more practical subjects... Math, for example.

## Talk

Traveler: Why are you here?
Carranza: If you're allowed to be here, surely I am. This place is ideal for usage as a classroom. I can start my undertaking here.

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry to bother you.
Carranza: Until next time.

## Talk

Traveler: ...Undertaking?
Carranza: Ideally, I would help everyone realize the beauty of mathematics. I know that is not realistic, though.
Carranza: So I will teach those willing to learn some practical mathematics. This will be much more meaningful than what the Tri-Coupon Troupe is doing.

## Talk

Traveler: Good luck.
Carranza: Thanks.

## Talk

Traveler: They both have their benefits.
Carranza: But you have to understand that very few people can manage both at once.

## Talk

Traveler: Good luck.
Carranza: Thanks.

## Talk

Carranza: Thanks for the match, I've learned a lot from our encounter.

Carranza: Looks like my deck needs a rethink...
