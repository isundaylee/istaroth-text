Traveler: About Song Gatherers...
Arakavi: #Thanks to Nara Traveler's help, the Song Gatherers have learned many songs that had been forgotten many sunrises ago,
Arakavi: These songs, to Aranara, are like Nara's "treasure."
Arakavi: #The song gatherers and Nara Traveler went to look for treasures together, and are good friends.
