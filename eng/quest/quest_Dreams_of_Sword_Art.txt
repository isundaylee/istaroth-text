# Dreams of Sword Art


## Talk 1

Nameless: Why? Why can't I find it?
Traveler: What are you looking for?
Nameless: I'm looking for... for... I've forgotten. Each time I think I'm about to remember it, it disappears from my mind.
Nameless: Hey, do you know what I'm supposed to be looking for?
Traveler: How would I know?
Nameless: Ugh, I just can't think...
Nameless: Curses, curses! Why can't I remember?
Traveler: It'll pop into your mind eventually.
Nameless: That won't do. I can't wait that long.
Nameless: Whatever it is that I'm looking for, it's definitely of the utmost importance to me. I need it back as soon as possible.
Nameless: I have an inexplicable feeling that the reason I am here in this place is to find that very thing. Failing to find it is not an option.
Nameless: I will strike down anyone that tries to interrupt me or stand in my way...
Nameless: Strike down... Wait, that's right! Brandishing a sword and executing people... it feels familiar, pleasing, hahaha, the surge of blood, like a river of red.
Nameless: When was my sword last stained red?
Nameless: Hmm, it must have been a few days by now. Well, at least you're here today.
Nameless: For now, let's leave aside the question of what I was looking for. I've tired myself out thinking about it for so long, and now I need to relax.
Nameless: Ah, it's been a while since I brandished my blade. I can hear Takatsuki Dougire complaining.
Nameless: Aw, listen, she's calling out because she wants to cut you into pieces, hahaha. Having a duel with you would make her very happy indeed.
Traveler: Are you... okay?
Nameless: You can't hear Takatsuki Dougire's voice? What a pity.
Nameless: Those who live by the sword know to listen to the voice of their blade. ...Hehe, she's nagging me to get on with it again.
Nameless: Come, draw your weapon and try your chances against me.
Traveler: Your sword can't speak.
Traveler: Think back to when you arrived here.
Nameless: When I got here? All I remember doing here is wielding my sword. As for why I was wielding it...
Nameless: Haha, yes, now that I do remember. I was executing someone!
Nameless: If you strike your enemy with your sword, blood surges like a river of red. It gives you a real rush, hahaha.
Traveler: Have you looked in all your pockets?
Nameless: I already have, it isn't on my person.
Nameless: Even though I don't remember what I was after, I can tell when something's not what I'm looking for. Whatever it is, it's not on me.
Nameless: Come on, what is it, what am I looking for...

## Talk 2

Nameless: Come, draw your weapon and try your chances against me.

## Talk 3

Nameless: I am defeated.
Nameless: I have cut countless people down, and have never once lost. Now that I have tasted defeat at your hands... I have bet and lost. I shall have no regrets even if it has cost me my life.
Traveler: I don't do that kind of thing.
Nameless: Haha! I draw my sword to kill. You do not?
Nameless: You fight strangely, and your bearing is far from normal. Not at all like those who I cut down.
Nameless: Which school do you belong to?
Traveler: ...
Nameless: Heh, unwilling to say, are you? It matters little. I remember nothing at all, so even had you mentioned your school of swordsmanship, I would not recognize it.
Nameless: Who was I? What did I do before drifting here? I... no longer remember any of these things.
Nameless: I only feel familiarity and peace with my sword in hand. Someone as lost as I must be doomed to wander this wasteland.
Traveler: I can try to help you.
Nameless: But not knowing even my own name, I cannot do anything but wander the world like a ghost. How can you help me?
Nameless: I do not know if I have family, or where my hometown is. There is nowhere for me to go but here.
Nameless: The only connection I have to that past is my swordsmanship.
Traveler: And where did you learn yours?
Nameless: My lineage... I no longer recall it, but it could not have come from nowhere.
Nameless: On this path, there is little hope for those who have no background at all.
Nameless: Even if one begins training hard from an early age, they cannot receive accurate instruction if they cannot pay a master to tutor them. They will have to go through many more twists and turns than the average person.
Nameless: Without a good sword, they can only go to the smelting plant to look for a discarded, inferior blade.
Nameless: Though it be inferior, they would cherish it, and even give the blade a name.
Nameless: They would train with every ounce of sweat in their body, and after many wounds and much persistence, they would gain a foundation... and yet they would still be mocked.
Nameless: Without a friend by their side, they would not be able to go on...
Nameless: Wait... Why... Why does this all feel so familiar?
Nameless: I think... I think I remember something. Two children wielding swords and sparring, next to their family homes... a hut...
Nameless: Yes... they lived in <color=#00E1FFFF>a hut in the fishing village to the north</color>... the hut was <color=#00E1FFFF>under a cliff</color>, and <color=#00E1FFFF>surrounded by sea on all sides</color>.
Nameless: They would take the <color=#00E1FFFF>steps behind the house</color> to the <color=#00E1FFFF>slope</color> to spar... Their blades might still be there.
Nameless: But who were "they"? Ugh, my head hurts. I can't... remember...
Nameless: ...
Nameless: Didn't you say that you would help me? Then please, help me find those two sword-wielding children, and bring me their swords. I... I think their swords may be related to me somehow.
Traveler: I understand.
Nameless: A samurai's word is his bond. I will wait here for you until you have brought me those swords.
Traveler: Who did you learn the sword from?
Traveler: I'm just a traveler.
Traveler: You should really just stop.

## Talk 4

Nameless: Who were those two children? Ugh, my head hurts. I can't... remember...
Traveler: Where did they live again?
Nameless: Yes... they lived in <color=#00E1FFFF>a hut in the fishing village to the north</color>... the hut was <color=#00E1FFFF>under a cliff</color>, and <color=#00E1FFFF>surrounded by sea on all sides</color>.
Nameless: They would take the <color=#00E1FFFF>steps behind the house</color> to the <color=#00E1FFFF>slope</color> to spar... Their blades might still be there.
Nameless: A samurai's word is his bond. I will wait here for you until you have brought me those swords.

## Talk 5

Nameless: Have you found the swords?

## Talk 6

Nameless: ...
Nameless: I remember. This... one of the two children used this sword.
Nameless: That child, he and his friend sneaked off to the smelting plant to obtain two identical swords that the smiths had discarded.
Nameless: The finest of blades were made there, but these two were of an inferior make, so those two children...
Nameless: I remember now, they would be mocked by others for not being able to afford swords made by famous smiths, and for using junk.
Nameless: Hah. I say, as long as it can slay foes in battle, it is a good blade.
Nameless: Who in this world is born bearing gold and jade? Nor does the battlefield distinguish between the noble and the lowly.
Nameless: Samurai, have you ever been on the battlefield?
Traveler: I am no samurai.
Nameless: You have not sought out a master despite your abilities? Folly.
Nameless: You should. One strike, and one strike only, is all it takes for someone to fall, whether they be a mighty general or a lowly ashigaru! Hahaha.
Nameless: But... I cannot die. No matter how many swordsmen or ronin came to challenge me, I was never defeated.
Nameless: Those who are only swordsmen in name... They fled, or they were all cut down. Hahah!
Nameless: You are the only one who has managed to defeat me... Curses. Curses! How did I lose?
Nameless: Curses! Curses! CURSES!
Nameless: Again! We will go again! I will not lose this time!
Traveler: No, I have not.

## Talk 7

Nameless: Are you ready?
Traveler: Give me a moment.
Nameless: I will let you prepare. Takatsuki Dougire and I will be here, no matter how long we must wait.
Nameless: Use your full strength against me once you are ready.
Traveler: Well, if you're ready to lose...
Nameless: Many have said this before Takatsuki Dougire cut them down. How many blows will you withstand?

## Talk 8

Nameless: You have defeated me... again.
Nameless: Will you not tell me where you learned your swordsmanship from?
Traveler: ...
Nameless: Do all true masters hide their true selves like this? Never mind. I shall not pry.
Nameless: It has been so long since I felt this fulfilled. Discarding all pointless thought and giving myself over to the blade.
Nameless: How strange... My body remembers this refreshing feeling as well.
Nameless: It's almost like... I could gain acceptance, own everything in this world... when I was wielding my sword, when my all was focused on winning victory.
Nameless: Yes, that's right. I once wielded this sword to sunder many armored bodies.
Nameless: I remember how I felt then. Mora and honor could all be gained by the sword. As long as I had the last laugh at the end of the raging battle, what did anything else matter? To the victor go the spoils!
Nameless: The spoils, the glory... So, I had such moments of satisfaction in my time, did I? When I was crowned with honor, acknowledged by my superiors, when the wine flowed freely...
Nameless: Wine... wine... How could I forget the wine I drank under the moonlight with my companions? I miss that taste.
Traveler: You've remembered!
Nameless: I remember now! I remember drinking wine together with people... it was a long time ago.
Nameless: I remember that we were inside a <color=#00E1FFFF>great encampment</color>. Men <color=#00E1FFFF>armed and dressed in armor</color> were all around us.
Nameless: We said something then... No, I can't remember it.
Traveler: Perhaps you'll remember if you drank the same wine from back then.
Nameless: You'll... you'll help me find that wine?
Traveler: I can.
Nameless: I... I am in your debt. Perhaps I shall indeed remember my past if I drank the same wine that I did back then.
Traveler: Where did you drink?
Traveler: I've told you, I'm a traveler.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Armored and armed men... does he mean soldiers from an army camp?
Paimon: If we head east from here, we'll reach some land that's mostly flat. Maybe that's where the camp is.

## Talk 10

Nameless: Who did I drink with... what did we say...

## Talk 11

Ishikawa: I hope this fragile peace will hold out a little longer...
Traveler: Do you know of a nameless samurai?
Ishikawa: I've never heard of some strange guy like that. You're barking up the wrong tree here.

## Talk 12

Kujou Masahito: Hmm? Why is a civilian like you wandering around in the military camp?
Traveler: Do you know of a nameless samurai?
Kujou Masahito: Serving no master, and slaying no foe on the battlefield. The person you speak of must be a ronin.
Kujou Masahito: There is no place in my army for such a person.
Unknown NPC (3111 ): Besides, order is valued above all here in a military encampment. This is no place for civilians to walk in and out of as they please. Please leave quickly.

## Talk 13

Matsudaira: The Sangonomiya rebels are just riff-raff.
Traveler: Do you know of a nameless samurai?
Matsudaira: Hmm. Born into a fishing village, joined the army, and that manner of speech... I think I know who you're talking about.
Matsudaira: After that last battle ended, a lot of folks went missing in action, that guy included.
Matsudaira: Usually, people who end up unaccounted for have either deserted or... you know, bought the farm.
Matsudaira: But that guy? With his skills, I don't think any of those riff-raff from Sangonomiya could have beaten him. I thought he'd fled.
Matsudaira: I never would've imagined that he'd lost his memories and become a madman who only knows how to wield a sword.
Matsudaira: Well then, were you here to ask about him, or did you want to do something else?
Traveler: Please help him regain his memory.
Matsudaira: Eh? You know, I wouldn't necessarily call losing your memories of the battlefield a bad thing, exactly.
Matsudaira: But you look like a good person. I mean, you came all this way just to help him out.
Matsudaira: As an old friend of his, I would like to help, but...
Matsudaira: As you can see, I have my duties here, and I cannot leave.
Traveler: I just need the wine that he drank in the past.
Matsudaira: Wine... That's all you need, then?
Matsudaira: I've got it. I'll give you my personal bottle of it, in fact.
Matsudaira: Back when he was still in the army, he, a friend from his hometown, and I would drink together.
Matsudaira: They were both of lowly birth, and would often be ostracized by those fools from richer families.
Matsudaira: He was a rough man who didn't care a whit about being excluded. He just threw himself into battle all the same...
Matsudaira: The General at the time quite liked him, and raised both him and his hometown friend to the rank of Hatamoto.
Matsudaira: But during that battle...
Matsudaira: *sigh* I always come to back to something awful whenever I think about the past. There's no point in nattering on, so I shan't.
Matsudaira: Well, you have the wine. If there's nothing else, best you take your leave.
Matsudaira: This is a military encampment, after all. If you tarry here too long, people might get the wrong idea.
Traveler: I'd like to know about his past.
Matsudaira: His past? As far as I'm aware, it's nothing particular happy...

## Talk 14

Nameless: Did you find the wine?

## Talk 15

Nameless: Let us duel once more, you and I.

## Talk 16

Nameless: This wine... it's bitter. That's not right.
Nameless: I remember that the wine we drank before wasn't like this. It only had the taste of excitement and joy.
Nameless: We took names and won glory... Should we not have been pleased with ourselves? And yet, why does this wine go down my throat so bitterly?
Nameless: And this bottle, I remember it. It has to be...
Nameless: He would take this bottle, and he would say: "Come on, Masanori, have another!"
Nameless: "Masanori"... "Masanori"... is that my name?
Traveler: So that's your name. Masanori.
"Masanori": Yes, yes, I remember! I would often drink with the same person. He and I were like brothers, and we would talk often.
"Masanori": But there was just this once, when he said something that... led to an argument, and so he left.
"Masanori": He was my brother-in-arms, through thick and thin. Why would he just leave like that... Why?
"Masanori": What did I do wrong? Do you know, samurai?
Traveler: You probably need to ask yourself that question.
"Masanori": But I want to know. I must know. Please, I want to know... I want to...
Traveler: Maybe it's for the best that you don't know.
Traveler: It's a fine name.

## Talk 17

"Masanori": My head... It hurts... Please, I beg of you, fight me once more. Use your blade to help me remember. Help me remember everything!
Traveler: Let me think about it.
"Masanori": What? What are you waiting for?
Traveler: Well then, have at it.
"Masanori": Let us cross swords.

## Talk 18

"Masanori": Defeated by the same person thrice. How am I this weak? I have honed my martial arts ability from childhood to today... How am I so useless?
"Masanori": Useless... useless... I'm a useless samurai... Wait, I remember now.
"Masanori": I saw a sword fall from someone's hands, and it wasn't Takatsuki Dougire. The sight of that sword sent me trembling all over, and my courage failed me...
"Masanori": I feared that fallen sword, and I fled from there, and ended up here.
Traveler: And where's that place?
"Masanori": I... I fled here from the <color=#00E1FFFF>tidal flats in the northwest</color>. That was where the battle took place.
"Masanori": Why was I so afraid of that sword? What happened there?
Traveler: I'll help you remember.
"Masanori": Remember, I have to remember, that sword... that sword...
Traveler: I'll help you find that sword.

## Talk 19

"Masanori": Remember, I have to remember, that sword... that sword...

## Talk 20

"Masanori": This is that sword. Yes, that was his sword.
"Masanori": But where is he? Where did he go? We agreed to go home together!
Traveler: What's come over you?
"Masanori": Why wasn't he there!? Argh... How can this be!!!

## Talk 21

"Masanori": I... I have truly been defeated.
"Masanori": I put everything on the line to wield my sword, but the martial arts that I so worshiped... they have been truly and pathetically beaten.
Traveler: Have you awakened?
"Masanori": You need not worry. I lost control earlier... Never again will I raise my hand against you of my own will.
"Masanori": I fought you to my heart's content four times, and discovered some shattered memories, obtained two swords, and a bottle of wine. I am satisfied.
"Masanori": Moreover, the more I remember, the more I feel anger and a deep pain rise up from within me. Perhaps my past is indeed far from a beautiful story.
"Masanori": I doubt I will gain much from becoming obsessed with it, so it is best that I put it down.
"Masanori": Nonetheless, I believe it to be greatly fortuitous that we met. I do not regret it.
Traveler: The feeling is mutual.
"Masanori": Hah, you are indeed straightforward.
"Masanori": I shall also be frank. I may be to you as a defeated foe, but if you are willing, I still wish to exchange pointers with you.
"Masanori": Warriors make friends best when their swords clash, rather than when they talk around a table.
"Masanori": I and Takatsuki Dougire will remain here, watching the sea and listening to the wind. We will be here any time to speak to you, should you wish it.
Traveler: Hahah, I'm still a little afraid of you.
Traveler: So we're not going to spar again?

## Talk 22

Traveler: Give me a second.
Nameless: I will let you prepare. Takatsuki Dougire and I will be here, no matter how long we must wait.
Nameless: Use your full strength against me once you are ready.

Traveler: Well then, have at it.
"Masanori": Let us cross swords.

### Additional Talk 5

Ishikawa: I hope this fragile peace will hold out a little longer...
Traveler: Do you know of a nameless samurai?
Ishikawa: Huh. This person you speak of seems rather strange. I've never encountered such a person.
Ishikawa: That said, there's been an arrest warrant out for some reckless fool who actually dared to take the Shogun on. That certainly sounds a little like the person you're talking about.
Ishikawa: What does the wanted fugitive look like, you ask? Uh... How did I forget that? Really, now...
Ishikawa: But I'd stay away from that guy if I were you. What if they're the wanted fugitive? I'd focus on keeping my head on my shoulders if I were you.

### Additional Talk 6

Kujou Masahito: Hmm? Why is a civilian like you wandering around in the military camp?

Kujou Masahito: Serving no master, and slaying no foe on the battlefield. The person you speak of must be a ronin.
Kujou Masahito: There is no place in my army for such a person.
Kujou Masahito: Are you just here to look for someone? If you are, please leave as soon as possible.
Kujou Masahito: I've received word that some scoundrel infiltrated the city and attempted to ambush our Almighty Shogun. My forces have also received an arrest warrant for this criminal.
Kujou Masahito: Well, you've also got blond hair. Best you leave, or you might be mistaken for that wanted fugitive.
Kujou Masahito: Looking at your thin build, forget surviving a battle with the Shogun — I personally doubt you'd be able to parry my spear even once. I have no wish to involve commoners in these struggles unnecessarily.
Kujou Masahito: Still, you do look quite familiar...
Traveler: Huh? I—I'm sure we've never met, good sir!
Unknown NPC (3111 ): ...Mm, fair enough.
Traveler: I'll head home immediately.

Matsudaira: This is a military camp, after all, and there's been an arrest warrant out and about lately. Things are really tight right now.
Matsudaira: Strangers like yourself would be wise not to stay here long, or some people might get the wrong idea.
Traveler: I'd like to know about his past.
Matsudaira: His past? As far as I'm aware, it's nothing particular happy...

### Additional Talk 8

"Masanori": Remember, I have to remember, that sword... that sword...

### Additional Talk 9

Paimon: *sigh* This guy isn't gonna listen to a word you say. Come on, let's go and try to find that sword before he goes berserk again.
