# Gourmet Supremos, Assemble!


## Talk 1

Xudong: Parvaneh, is there really no other way to do this?
Parvaneh: My book only mentions this one way.
Julie: Heh, if only it was just a bunch of monsters barring our path...
Traveler: Are these the Sakura Blooms you've been looking for?
Xudong: Ah! Yes, that they are! And this color...
Julie: Woohoo! Guess we can finally eat now!
Parvaneh: Wait, you've already passed through that barrier? Did you use the method I told you about?
Traveler: That I did.
Parvaneh: Could you tell me where you found that Thunder Sakura Bough?
Parvaneh: When you touched that Bough, how did the Electrogranum come to rest upon you?
Parvaneh: ...Wait, I'm sorry, let me pull out my notebook. So, did you feel anything after the Electrogranum attached itself to you? And...
Xudong: Parvaneh, please, give this Traveler a moment. They just helped us out... I think your research can wait a bit, right?
Xudong: Thank you very much, Traveler. As we agreed, you will be paid.
Xudong: But before that, just wait here with us for a while. I believe I'll be able to make a dish with the Sakura Blooms you brought.
Xudong: I've heard of an Inazuman specialty known as Sakura Tempura. I suppose now's the time to try it out.
Xudong: Give me a while to prepare. It shouldn't take too long, so come find me in a moment.

## Talk 2

Xudong: It goes like this... and this...
Traveler: Have you finished it yet?
Xudong: Just hold on a moment... wrap it up in flour, put it in to dry...
Xudong: And there we go! Sakura Tempura — try it while it's hot!
Julie: I—It's delicious! ... If a bit too hot...
Parvaneh: Xudong, I believe that this "tempura" also needs to be served with a special dipping sauce...
Xudong: A dipping sauce? Well, I must say that I haven't prepared one of those yet. I'll look into it next time should we get the chance.
Xudong: This serving of Sakura Tempura is yours, Traveler. Please take it as thanks for your help.
Xudong: Ah yes, I'll give you a copy of the recipe too. Just give me a moment to write it down...
Xudong: Try it yourself if you get the chance! Cooking is really fun, you know?
Traveler: Thank you.
Xudong: Don't mention it!
Xudong: We'll be in Inazuma for a while, so I suspect that we might head to <color=#00E1FFFF>Kannazuka</color> later.
Xudong: Julie says that she also wants to see that Sacred Sakura Tree at the Grand Narukami Shrine.
Xudong: They say that all the Sakura Blooms on this island fell from that huge tree.
Xudong: I wonder, how large must that tree have been to have so many leaves fall from it...
Xudong: You should pay it a visit if it takes your fancy, too.
Xudong: Thank you for your help once again, Traveler. Well, I'm going to have a bite too. I'm starving...
Traveler: Where will you all be going next?

## Talk 3

Xudong: Parvaneh, is there really no other way to do this?
Parvaneh: My book only mentions this one way.
Julie: Heh, if only it was just a bunch of monsters barring our path...
Traveler: Could you repeat that method of yours to me again?
Parvaneh: Eh, allow me. Basically, you need to search for something nearby known as a Thunder Sakura Bough and touch it.
Parvaneh: After that, something known as an Electrogranum will attach itself to you, and that will allow you to pass through the barrier.
