# Talk Dialog

Traveler: You really care about everyone, don't you?
Chubo: The people in our village are a good lot, and the tea they produce is precious. I can't stand to see good people and precious things suffer.
Chubo: A place gains stability from the balance of its produce. I hope more youngsters will realize this...
Chubo: And stop focusing on just growing and selling tea, but consider the future of the entire village.
Chubo: I'll talk to Uncle Luo about my suggestions some other day...
