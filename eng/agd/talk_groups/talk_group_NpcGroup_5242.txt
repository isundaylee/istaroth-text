Traveler: About the Geode Mine Shaft...
Camden: *yawn* Sorry, I'm a bit tired. I think it's because of the stones... Have you ever heard anyone talk about how they have a mysterious energy?
Camden: I don't know what the Fontaine Research Institute engineers do with the stones. But they form here, looking like that. Just thinking about them makes me sleepy...
Camden: If... If you can avoid it, don't go over there. Otherwise I'll need to write a report... *yawn*

Traveler: About the middle gearwheel...
Camden: Oh, that... That's, uh, an old issue from way back when.
Camden: Just don't go touching it. I don't want my whole world to start spinning while I'm enjoying a proper snooze...
Camden: Heh. I just mean, if you do move it make sure you don't accidentally trap anyone. It's happened before.
Camden: Not that creatures like humans will ever learn from their mistakes, of course.

Traveler: About the Geode Mine Shaft...
Camden: Clynes's device isn't as useful as he claims it is... But there are four of you.
Camden: In that case, it would be best if I knew nothing about any of this. In fact, it must be something I dream up while sleeping in my lovely soft bed.
Camden: *cough* Estienne wrote the incident report. I don't know what happened. I just found a new place to take a beautiful nap.

Traveler: About the middle gearwheel...
Camden: Oh, that... That's, uh, an old issue from way back when.
Camden: Just don't go touching it again, please. I don't want my whole world to start spinning while I'm enjoying a proper snooze...
Camden: And if something does go wrong I can't act like I didn't see anything this time. I mean, I'm right here.
Camden: And if say I didn't see anything, that would prove I've been sleeping on the job. I hope you can understand.
