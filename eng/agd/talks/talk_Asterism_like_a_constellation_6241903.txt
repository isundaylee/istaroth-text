Traveler: Asterism... like a constellation?
Ziwei: Yes, essentially. Asterisms are the patterns formed by groups of stars in the night sky. Sometimes they even make recognizable shapes. There's nothing that gets me more excited than that.
Ziwei: I note down and collect asterisms like some people collect shells on a beach. Whenever I find a new one, I always like to give it a special and unique name.
