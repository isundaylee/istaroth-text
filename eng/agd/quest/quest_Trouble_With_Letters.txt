# Trouble With Letters


## Talk 1

Jiayi: *sigh* What shall I do...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Jiayi: You must have seen those meteorites that fell from the sky as well, right? Fortunately, the city wasn't hit, but it's a real mess out there in the wild.
Jiayi: Not only have the meteorites blocked the roads, but they've also caused the nearby monsters to become more agitated and dangerous than usual, and they've been attacking passers-by and merchants everywhere.
Jiayi: The Ministry of Civil Affairs has sent almost every single available Millelith out, but Liyue is far too large. We can only ensure the safety of a few main roads and some key villages.
Jiayi: I'd applied to go to Qingce Village to take up guard duties there, but for some reason, I still got redeployed here to stand by for orders...
Jiayi: Traveler, could you help me send this letter to a girl named Little Liu who lives in Qingce Village?
Jiayi: She's my daughter, and I'd agreed to go back to spend a few days with her. But with this emergency cropping up, there's no way that'll happen now...
Traveler: I've got your back.
Jiayi: Much appreciated, Traveler. Ah, what horrible luck...
Jiayi: That said, I've heard from people who've come to stand down from duty that quite a few monsters have gathered near Qingce Village as well.
Jiayi: Well... I don't mean to impose, but you do look dressed for adventure.
Jiayi: Could you have a look around Qingce Village while you're sending the letter, and help to clear the monsters out?
Jiayi: The Millelith largely stand guard on the main roads and key passes... Things could go poorly if some scattered monsters were able to sneak into Qingce Village.
Traveler: Alright then...
Jiayi: Thank you! I truly appreciate it.
Traveler: Well, that'll run you extra...
Jiayi: Well, um... Don't worry, I will arrange fair compensation for you.
Jiayi: You have my thanks.
Traveler: It wasn't in your hands...
Jiayi: I know, but... I just don't get it. Why does something happen every time I try to apply for leave?
Jiayi: I'm finding it hard to call it a coincidence...
Jiayi: Well, I'll leave it to you then. Please help me get this letter to Little Liu.

## Talk 2

Jiayi: *sigh* When will I finally be able to clear my leave...

## Talk 3

Little Liu: That's so weird. Why does something happen every time Daddy applies for leave?

## Talk 4

Traveler: Any idea where Little Liu is?
Yundan: Little Liu? Hmm, I remember her saying that she wanted to find a high place so she could watch the meteorites...
Yundan: Hmm, I think she *climbed up those ladders over there*.

## Talk 5

Traveler: Do you where Little Liu is?
Dongdong: Little Liu? We were going to meet here to watch the meteorites, but she said that she wanted to find someplace higher.
Dongdong: She said that she'd tell me once she found our new spot, but I don't know where she's gone.

## Talk 6

Traveler: So, about Little Liu...
Uncle Ghast: Little Liu... Little Liu... Ah yes, I know her. But I've been here all this while, and she didn't pass this way.

## Talk 7

Little Liu: I should be able to see the meteorites clearly from here...
Traveler: There's a letter for you...
Little Liu: A letter from Daddy... Ugh, I already know what it's going to say...
Little Liu: He can't come and spend time with me because of work, right?
Little Liu: When those Millelith came here, I thought Daddy would be with them, but that didn't happen...
Little Liu: But that's not a bad thing, actually. With all those rocks falling from the sky, Daddy could be in danger out there.
Traveler: Aren't you scared?
Little Liu: Well... a little, but we should be alright. The Millelith are here, after all.
Little Liu: Right! Could you send this letter back to Daddy for me? He must be worried.
Little Liu: It's so strange. Something seems to happen every time Daddy says he'll take leave and spend time with me...
Traveler: Don't go out there, now.
Little Liu: I know, I know. The Millelith have talked our ears off already.

## Talk 8

Jiayi: You're back. Did you manage to deliver the letter?
Traveler: I did. Little Liu has a letter for you too, by the by.
Jiayi: Little Liu wrote me a letter? Let me see...

## Talk 9

Jiayi: Thank you, Traveler. I'll keep this for the time being. This is not the time to be reading letters... I must attend to my duties now.
Jiayi: Please take this as compensation for your trouble.
Jiayi: Once this is all over, I'm taking a long break for sure...
