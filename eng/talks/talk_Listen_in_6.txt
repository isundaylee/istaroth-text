Jiewu: ...Just as the raging waves were about to swallow Chenyu Vale, the Millelith Sergeant in command ordered the weapons, armor, and shields to be put together to form numerous ladders...

Jiewu: Just then, a melodic splash of water resounded through the mountains! A piece of jade emerged from the clouds, surged forward through the waves, and overtook them!
