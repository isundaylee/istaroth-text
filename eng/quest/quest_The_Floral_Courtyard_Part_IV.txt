# The Floral Courtyard: Part IV


## Talk 1

Fushizome: The day has finally arrived, you two.
Fushizome: You have already grasped the essence of the composition of floral courtyards.
Fushizome: Now, it's time for a real test of your floral art mastery.
Paimon: Eh? We've already grasped the essence of it?
Paimon: And "real test," you say... So this is gonna be the hardest theme, right? Ohh, Paimon's getting kinda worried.
Traveler: We haven't spent that long doing ikebana, to be honest.
Fushizome ("Tulipe"): Yes, it is true that the act of processing the flowers must be practiced over a great length of time. However, the planning and structuring of floral courtyards is more dependent on awareness and inspiration.
Fushizome: If we're merely talking about the latter, the two of you have displayed stunning talent. I do not believe that you need any further refinement via thematic quizzes.
Fushizome: Or perhaps I should say that it must be your fascinating travels and the sights you've seen, the likes of which I could never imagine, that has conferred this unique mindscape upon you.
Paimon: Huh. Is... is that so...
Paimon: #Speaking of which, Traveler, we really have been to lots of places and seen loads of things. To think that would've given us so much inspiration...
Paimon: Paimon wonders how much of it we've spent on learning this art?
Traveler: Don't worry, our journey will continue.
Paimon: Ooh, that's true.
Paimon: Thanks so much, Ms. Fushizome! If it wasn't for your guidance, we wouldn't have discovered this hidden talent of ours at all!
Fushizome: Haha. You're too kind. Well then, let us close this journey off with the loveliest floral courtyard of them all.
Traveler: Alright, hit us with the topic.
Fushizome: Indeed. Today's theme is...
Fushizome: "The branches, curved like rainbows, are dyed in myriad colors."
Fushizome: Well then, I look forward to your greatest work.
Traveler: I've got some other things to do at the moment...
Fushizome: That's alright. Ikebana requires one's full attention, after all.
Fushizome: Once you have completed the various tasks you have on hand, rendering yourself free of disturbances, I'm certain that your floral courtyard shall be all the more perfect for it.
Traveler: Inspiration will keep on coming.

## Talk 2

Fushizome: In the following days, I will continue to stay here and guide those who come for the Irodori Festival, and help them to enjoy the beauty of the "floral courtyards."
Fushizome: Don't forget to drop by every day to get another "theme." There will be a total of four such themes for you to figure out.
Fushizome: Of course, if you have any other questions, I will do my best to answer them for you.
Traveler: About the flowers here...
Fushizome: The flowers I use are all provided by Sakuya's Flowers. The flowers they grow are of impeccable quality and affordable prices.
Fushizome: Perhaps you've met Sakuya as well. We once studied ikebana under the same master.
Fushizome: Sakuya is also very well-studied in the floral arts, but when she heard that there would be tons of people at the Irodori Festival, she seemed to have gotten a bit of stage fright. She said that it would be difficult to quiet down and focus on her work in such an environment.
Fushizome: In any case, I will advertise Sakuya's Flowers on her behalf.
Paimon: We can help too if you need us!
Fushizome: Well then, do the two of you have any other questions?
Traveler: Thank you, Ms. Fushizome.
Fushizome: Think nothing of it. If you have time, you can come and look for me any time.
Traveler: About the Yashiro Commission's involvement...
Fushizome: The Yashiro Commission has always been very supportive of Inazuma's floral arts. Indeed, the person who sponsored this event is the Shirasagi Himegimi.
Fushizome: She has always been incredibly talented in these arts, even from a young age. I saw her perform ikebana once, and even had the honor of exchanging pointers with her.
Fushizome: Although I'm older than her, I'm nowhere near her ability in terms of skill in ikebana or understanding of the floral arts.
Fushizome: Where circumstances have permitted, she has provided funding to help publicize ikebana every year. I've even heard that she has used her own savings to do so...
Fushizome: She once expressed her frank desire for more people to understand ikebana and to drum up more interest in it such that more might want to practice this art.
Paimon: Huh. So Ayaka did so much for Inazuma's floral arts...
Traveler: I hope her wish comes true.
Fushizome: Thank you both. You are indeed good-hearted people.
Traveler: I have no further questions at the moment.
Fushizome: Alright, then. You can come and look for me any time.
