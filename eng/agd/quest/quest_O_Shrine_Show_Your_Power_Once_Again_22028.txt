# O Shrine, Show Your Power Once Again!


## Talk 1

Shouta: #{F#Big sis}{M#Big bro}! Listen! Listen!
Shouta: After I made an offering to the shrine from last time, my wish was granted... a small part of it, at least! But although it's just a small part... this must be the archon's answer, right?
Traveler: What was your wish?
Shouta: Uhh... the wish I made last time was for the creator of the manga I'm reading to be more productive. Having one update every two days would be best!
Shouta: And then, the creator actually did double the amount of updated content in one issue!
Shouta: However... I've also heard that he's gonna take a break for 3 issues.
Traveler: Perfectly balanced, as all things should be, I guess...?
Shouta: Hmm... anyway, I'm sure the archon heard my wishes. That means that the reason why they were not realized is that I didn't offer enough things!
Shouta: So we're going to make an offering to other shrines today! This way, I'm sure my wishes will be granted completely!
Shouta: I have asked my parents, and they say that there are still two shrines around here. One is near Komore Teahouse, and the other one is on the way out of the city.
Shouta: #Which shrine do you think we should go to first, {F#big sis}{M#big bro}?
Traveler: Feels like you'll be short one issue overall...

## Talk 2

Traveler: Let's go check out the shrine at Komore Teahouse first.

## Talk 3

Traveler: Let's check out the shrine at the city outskirts first.

## Talk 4

Shouta: Nice! Let's go!

## Talk 5

Traveler: Let's make an offering of Konpeito candy, then.
Shouta: Great! Let's do just that!
Shouta: Hopefully, the archon will answer me this time as well.
Shouta: I'll be back here tomorrow to see if anything special's happened.
Shouta: Alright, thank you for sticking with me this whole time. Please have these!
Shouta: I really hope that the archon will answer my wishes...

## Talk 6

Shouta: This is the place.
Shouta: I heard that a Doushin made an offering of many paper cranes here a long, long time ago, wishing that everyone at Hanamizaka can live peacefully.
Shouta: Soon after, a fire broke out nearby, and a house caught on fire. However, that house was built with shoddy materials anyway, so the fire finished it off really quickly, and it couldn't spread at all...
Shouta: Everybody believes that this was the archon's protection... Hehe, that's why I've also folded some paper cranes and brought them here.
Shouta: And that's enough chitchat! What should we offer this time then?
Shouta: We might get a response if we offer paper cranes, just like that Doushin.
Shouta: But since this shrine is near the teahouse, would it be better if we make an offering of matcha-flavored Konpeito candies?
Shouta: Yeah, and matcha-flavored Konpeito candies are things I like, too...
Shouta: #What do you think, {F#big sis}{M#big bro}?

## Talk 7

Traveler: Let's make an offering of paper cranes, then.
Shouta: Great! Let's do just that!
Shouta: Hopefully, the archon will answer me this time as well.
Shouta: I'll be back here tomorrow to see if anything special's happened.
Shouta: Alright, thank you for sticking with me this whole time. Please have these!
Shouta: I really hope that the archon will answer my wishes...

## Talk 8

Shouta: Well, this is the place.
Shouta: A long time ago, someone made an offering to this shrine with Iron Ore used for forging blades, hoping that his martial arts skills could improve quickly.
Shouta: Later on, that guy went to a martial arts tournament and defeated every adversary super easy! Everyone commended his outstanding martial skills.
Shouta: However, according to him, none of his opponents seemed to be feeling too good...
Shouta: It feels like the archon doesn't have very clear standards...
Shouta: But anyway, everyone thinks that the archon did it. That's why I think we'll get a response if we make a wish at this shrine.
Shouta: Well, that aside, what should we offer this time?
Shouta: Just like that guy, maybe we can get some response if we offer Iron Ore!
Shouta: I found some near the entrance of the blacksmith's. However, they don't look all that good, which is probably why the blacksmith didn't mind giving them to me.
Shouta: I've also gathered some fresh seagrass from around here. If I cook them and sprinkle some sugar... they'll surely taste amazing.
Shouta: I'm just not sure if the archon likes this kind of small, cold dishes...
Shouta: #What do you think, {F#big sis}{M#big bro}?
Shouta: Are you really making progress if other people are just falling behind?
