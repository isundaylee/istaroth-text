# The Strongest Opponent! The Biggest Crisis!


## Talk 1

Haniyyah: #The day has finally arrived, Traveler and Paimon.
Haniyyah: I warned you not to get emotionally attached to the Fungi. You have to treat them as your pawns...
Haniyyah: But it seems like you haven't changed one bit. In which case, this match will be a short one.
Traveler: You're the one that needs to change.
Paimon: Yeah! When we send Bongo-Head and buddies into action, it's like clockwork! And we ain't about to stop tickin'!
Haniyyah: *sigh* ...Time to show you how a real beast-tamer fights. Your feeble strategy will be your undoing! Go, Pyro-1!
Traveler: We'll show you.

## Talk 2

Haniyyah: How in the... Pyro-1, why did you hold back?
Traveler: You're the one giving the orders.
Paimon: Don't blame Pyro-1, Haniyyah. And don't force yourself to do something you don't want to. You started having second thoughts when Pyro-1 got injured during the semifinals, didn't you?
Paimon: You'd never met a well-matched opponent until you fought Miko and now us, had you? So you've never had to put Pyro-1 or any of your other Fungi in danger before.
Paimon: When you saw one of your Fungi get injured for the first time, you realized you felt compassion for it.
Haniyyah: "Compassion"? You really think I feel anything for these Fungi?
Traveler: Yes. It's painfully obvious.
Paimon: Haniyyah... You grew up listening to terrible tales about the horrors of Fungi. Paimon completely understands how they made you feel.
Paimon: But that doesn't mean that you should just treat a buddy who stands by you here as your arch-enemy... You won't be able to lie to yourself forever.
Paimon: We fight off fierce Fungi all the time, and we always used to think of them as "monsters," too. The whole reason we entered this tournament is because we didn't want Fungi causing any trouble.
Paimon: But after meeting Bongo-Head, we realized that if you just give them some time and treat them well, the gentler Fungi will get to know you and treat you like their friends!
Paimon: At the very least, treat the Fungi like they're on your side. Not as your pawns, and certainly not as your enemy! Please, learn to trust Pyro-1 and your other Fungi friends.
Traveler: Say no to prejudice.
Haniyyah: Enough! Don't patronize me! In case you've forgotten, this match isn't over yet.
Traveler: Treat your Fungi right.
Traveler: You're just in denial.
Traveler: Pyro-1 has become more than just a pawn to you.

## Talk 3

Elchingen: #Ladies and gentlemen, after some fierce competition in the rounds so far, we arrive, at long last, at the final of the Nilotpala Cup! It's time to find out who is the very best beast-tamer of all: Haniyyah or the Traveler, Traveler!
Elchingen: If the winner of the final round makes it through the Ultimate Trial, they will acquire my entire fortune. It will then be their responsibility to continue hosting this tournament into the future and to promote the philosophy of peaceful coexistence throughout all of Teyvat...
Paimon: Kautilya isn't here today... This is our chance! After the final match and the Ultimate Trial, we'll go tip off Elchingen, and confront Kautilya head on!
Paimon: Miko, Layla, you're here!
Black Screen Text: You bring Miko and Layla up to speed on your conversation with Haniyyah and your plan for today.
Yae Miko: Much as I expected. The insufferable research maniac has exposed his true colors to our two protagonists... You seem to be edging ever closer to the truth.
Yae Miko: Holding off on reporting Kautilya to the Akademiya seems like a sensibly cautious decision at this stage. Who's to say if Kautilya — or indeed, anyone else for that matter — is really who they appear to be?
Paimon: Yeah, we can't afford to let our guards down now. We gotta fight Haniyyah first, the strongest beast-tamer out there. And we still have no idea what we're in for with Elchingen's Ultimate Trial.
Paimon: How are we gonna get through to Haniyyah, though...
Yae Miko: The answer should be quite obvious by now, surely?
Yae Miko: Take all of our Fungi and defeat her fair and square. Force her to let go of her stubborn attitude and listen to the truth.
Layla: I believe in you guys... I know you'll be able to get her to come around!
Traveler: Thanks for all your support!
Paimon: Aw, yeah! Bongo-Head, Twirly-Whirly, and Blitzara, the tightest power-trio in all of shroomdom!
Paimon: With your powers combined, winning this final will be easier than taking a radish from a hilichurl!

## Talk 4

Haniyyah: I've failed... Just before the most important step of all, I've failed...
Haniyyah: You two... you were the only ones who could stop me. But how, when your mindset is so childish?
Traveler: We'll show you how.
Paimon: Haniyyah, as we agreed, you have to hear us out now that we've won.
Paimon: But let's put that aside for now. Can we bring Pyro-1 along for the Ultimate Trial?
Haniyyah: Pyro-1? You want to take it with you?
Paimon: Yep! We wanna pass the Ultimate Trial with everyone's Fungi side-by-side: Bongo-Head, Twirly-Whirly, Blitzara, and Pyro-1.
Traveler: We'll earn the rights to all these Fungi.
Paimon: We looked through your notebook that day after we spoke to you, and it cleared up a lot of things. You're right to be concerned about the dangers of Fungi, up to a point.
Paimon: Wisdom Orbs come with health risks to some people. This tournament shouldn't have been promoted so widely, and there are limits to how closely Fungi and humans can coexist in general.
Paimon: However, by making constant improvements to the Wisdom Orb and using it for friendly communication with the Fungi, we can figure out which are the nice ones and gradually learn more about them.
Haniyyah: ...Fine, if that's what you want. I lost, so I don't get to call the shots. ...And I guess Pyro-1 would rather be with someone who actually cares about it.
Paimon: Cheer up, Haniyyah! Paimon's sure you mean a lot to Pyro-1... We have more important stuff we gotta tell you after the Ultimate Trial!
Traveler: Regarding your ancestors...
Paimon: That's right! You'll see things differently after you know the story, Paimon just knows it...
Elchingen: I just had to say — what a magnificent duel! A battle between competing philosophies as well as a showdown between two top beast-tamers!
Paimon: Elchingen? What are you doing in the arena?
Elchingen: Why, I'm here to witness the final duel and the winner's spectacular performance in the Ultimate Trial! How could I possibly miss such a milestone moment in this tournament's history?
Elchingen: Come now, Traveler, Paimon. It's time to prove yourselves. I have no doubt that you'll play a significant role in bringing this tournament to a whole new level.
Traveler: And the truth behind the Fungi attack...
Traveler: We'll make sure they're all properly looked after.
Traveler: Then you'll finally understand.

## Talk 5

Paimon: What's going on here... Why are there Fatui everywhere?
Paimon: Elchingen, the arena's been taken over by bad guys! We'll deal with them — get yourself to safety!
Paimon: Wait a second... Where is the exit?
Traveler: The arena hasn't been taken over by bad guys...
Elchingen: The Traveler is correct. Nothing gets past you, does it? In which case, I presume you planned for this eventuality... no?
Paimon: Wait, this is all wrong... Isn't this the Ultimate Trial? Kautilya's supposed to be the villain! He was just using this tournament for his own agenda, and he tricked you into sponsoring him...
Elchingen: Hmm, not far off. You're right about Kautilya's motivations — this started when he discovered a promising use for a forgotten technology.
Elchingen: So I bought his loyalty and organized this tournament to expand the reach of his technology. Though I must say, I never expected a prize catch like yourself to take the bait so eagerly.
Traveler: Not as eagerly as you're confessing to your crimes.
Paimon: So... you weren't being fooled by Kautilya. It was you using him! This whole time you were just another lousy Fatui!
Paimon: Now Paimon's mad! So much for warning you about Kautilya... Bongo-Head, get him!
Elchingen: Ooh look at you! I've got chills down my spine. But I'm afraid that's not happening.
Paimon: Twirly-Whirly? Blitzara? Pyro-1? What's going on!?
Elchingen: Kautilya added a handy little backdoor in the Wisdom Orbs. Soon as I send the command, all Fungi under their control report to me instead.
Traveler: A backdoor?
Paimon: So, this whole tournament... It was just an elaborate ploy to get other people to capture Fungi for you! And now you're gonna make them all into your evil minions!
Elchingen: Very impressive, you hit all the key notes there. I hold the tournament a few times, build up an army of Fungi living amongst the people... and then I can create all kinds of damage. You have to understand, this is a huge opportunity for me.
Elchingen: My accomplishments will eclipse those of all my other comrades. And then, my dear master Dottore, who left because of you, will finally realize that I can still be worth something to him...
Traveler: Dottore...
Elchingen: But now... I think I might go one step further.
Elchingen: Getting rid of you would be doing a major service for all the Fatui, from the foot-soldiers to the harbingers. This could be a career-making moment for me... I'll finally earn Master Dottore's respect...
Elchingen: I'll just say it was a tragic accident. You placed too much trust in the Fungi, tried to push past the limits, and ended up causing the whole arena to collapse with you still inside.
Elchingen: Once this domain's sealed off, no one will ever find you. I'll have Kautilya assume all liability and criminal charges, then inform the Akademiya.
Elchingen: After that, I'll invest even more into this tournament, in the name of honoring your memory. I'll promote it harder, the competitions will be bigger and more frequent...
Paimon: You... selfish, double-crossing monster! How could you!?
Paimon: Grr... Paimon's heard just about enough from you, mister! You'll never get away with this!
Paimon: But... what are we gonna do? You don't have any weapons on you, and our shroom buddies won't respond to us anymore!
Traveler: It's every man... or shroom for themselves!
Elchingen: #Take your time. Pit Fungi against Fungi and warriors against warriors. I want the Traveler to see {F#her}{M#his} "buddy" being destroyed... Then, once {F#her}{M#his} faith is utterly shattered, put {F#her}{M#him} out of {F#her}{M#his} misery, quickly and painlessly.
Elchingen: I accept that our actions thus far have not been beyond reproach... but at least we can give the Traveler the ceremonious final farewell that they deserve.
Traveler: I have faith in Bongo-Head!
Traveler: You've worked for Dottore before...
Traveler: You can continue your confession in jail.
Traveler: This was all part of Elchingen's plan.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Give a speech

## Talk 7

Paimon: Bongo-Head! Are you okay!?
Traveler: There are too many of them...
Elchingen: This isn't right... I've activated the backdoor command three times now on the Floating Hydro Fungus, why is it still obeying the Traveler?
Elchingen: Is Kautilya's device malfunctioning?
Yae Miko: Oh dear, the poor thing still hasn't realized.
Yae Miko: The technology in the Wisdom Orb does make Fungi more obedient to their beast-tamers, but all it does to achieve this is suppress some of their basic instincts, allowing them to communicate with their owner as effectively as any other animal.
Yae Miko: The trust that these four Fungi place in their beast-tamers, and the bond they now share, have grown stronger than the Wisdom Orb.
Elchingen: Yae Miko... Y—You broke the domain-sealing spell?
Yae Miko: Please! You thought your crude replicas could keep me out? You appear to have woefully underestimated who you're dealing with...
Yae Miko: Not to mention that shoddily designed backdoor command... Did you honestly believe that no one would notice the litany of vulnerabilities in your grand plan?
Elchingen: Curses...
Paimon: Miko! Layla! ...And Haniyyah, too!
Haniyyah: Elchingen... So this was all YOUR doing!?
Haniyyah: Whatever threat the Fungi might pose, your nefarious ambitions are the true menace here...
Layla: C'mon, Miss Yae... Let's go help them!
Yae Miko: Easy now, Layla. All that's left for us to do now is to watch and wait. The bond of companionship is not something so easily severed by the designs or devices of humans.
Yae Miko: Blitzara, you haven't completed your mission yet. You're not thinking of giving up now, are you?
Paimon: Huh? Look, Blitzara's back to normal!
Layla: Is this the moment Miss Yae said we were waiting for...?
Layla: Twirly-Whirly, I believe in you! Take this crook down... *coughing*
Paimon: The backdoor command is wearing off... They're all returning to normal!
Yae Miko: Still doubting what your heart tells you, Haniyyah?
Yae Miko: You're afraid... afraid to accept that the Fungus you treated as a pawn now trusts you completely. Because then you'll be forced to face your true feelings, which you have been trying so desperately to escape from.
Yae Miko: But don't keep your Fungus waiting much longer... Look, now that it's no longer under the Wisdom Orb's control, it's waiting for your orders.
Haniyyah: Pyro-1... Are you really waiting for me?
Haniyyah: I'm sorry, I... I've been so harsh on you, but you still trust me...
Haniyyah: Go, do what you have to do.
Paimon: ...Well, one way or another, it looks like all the Fungi have returned to their senses! Great!
Paimon: Shame on you, Elchingen! You're about to pay for what you've done!
Elchingen: Hold the line, and keep your heads. They're just a handful of Fungi. We still have the upper hand.

## Talk 8

Elchingen: Beaten by a few measly Fungi... This is absurd!
Traveler: Where do you think you're going?
Paimon: Miko! Why didn't you stop him!?
Yae Miko: Hmm? Oh, I'm just a tourist. As far as I'm aware, I don't have the authority to detain anybody within Sumeru's borders... Is that not the case for you, too?
Yae Miko: Still, you needn't worry. He won't escape. You'll see once you get back to the tournament arena.
Paimon: Huh, cryptic... Well, no time to figure that one out — on with the chase!

## Talk 9

Paimon: You're from... the Corps of Thirty?
Traveler: You finally made your move.
Sido: By order of the General Mahamatra, we're here to arrest Elchingen for grave crimes, and Kautilya for academic misconduct.
Sido: The General Mahamatra has been watching Kautilya closely for some time. He's busy dealing with other affairs today, so he couldn't find the time to apprehend the offenders himself. Thankfully, with all the evidence you gathered, we were able to swiftly bring this case to a conclusion.
Sido: The General Mahamatra wrote a letter for the two of you. Please take a look.
Paimon: So Cyno's been keeping an eye on this competition, too. He and his people must have been secretly investigating at the same time as we were! Lucky we had some backup!
Traveler: The timing worked out perfectly.
Sido: Alright, we'll take the suspects away now. The arena will be unattended while we're gone, but with you here, I can put my mind at ease.
Elchingen: You might think this is over, but mark my words...
Elchingen: You haven't seen the last of me... or of Master Dottore.
Paimon: Oh, quit while you're behind, loser! Have fun in prison, you Fatui low-life!
Paimon: Wait, Cyno mentioned that he used our evidence. So... is that where Miko was going after the Last 16? To hand it in and make a report?
Yae Miko: Oh please, spare me that look. I didn't sign up for any of this. I'm supposed to be having a nice vacation, but all sorts of vexing issues keep managing to find their way to me...
Yae Miko: After the round of 16, I simply took a walk around Sumeru City with my editors. I did have a very brief conversation with the General Mahamatra, but only because he happened to be passing by at the time. The evidence you gathered was the key to solving this case.
Paimon: Uhh... The more you try playing it down, the more confusing it all sounds...
Layla: Um, anyway, now that the organizer and the sponsor have both been arrested, what should we do about the Fungi and this tournament?
Yae Miko: The rules still stand. These little ones won the tournament and passed the Ultimate Trial, which means they'll be taking Elchingen and Kautilya's place.
Yae Miko: From now on, everything about this tournament will be up to these two to decide. And after all the experience they've gained, I'm sure they are more than up to the task.
Traveler: First things first, we need to tell Haniyyah the truth.
Haniyyah: Lady Kitsune told me everything. The Fungi that attacked my ancestors were out of control because they'd gone berserk.
Haniyyah: Everything I thought I knew about the Fungi was based on a misunderstanding. I took it all much too far...
Paimon: Huh? We didn't get to say anything! Miko, why'd you have to steal our thunder?
Yae Miko: Hah! If by that you mean "thank you, Miko," then you're welcome. Haniyyah needed a little pep talk to perk her up so that she would join us in taking a stand against Elchingen. How else was I supposed to motivate her?
Haniyyah: You don't have to say any more... I was too closed-minded, I know that now. I kept telling myself the same things, lying to myself until I became numb...
Haniyyah: But now, I've seen the truth with my own eyes. Even without the Wisdom Orb, Pyro-1 willingly followed my instruction. It trusted me all along...
Haniyyah: I hold my hands up: I was wrong. You're well within your rights to criticize me, and I accept whatever punishment you deem appropriate.
Paimon: Punishment!? What do you take us for! Sure, you said some pretty scary things, and you were way too strict with Pyro-1, but clearly you've already learned your lesson.
Paimon: ...Wait, actually, having said that — Paimon has an idea!
Traveler: Me too.
Black Screen Text: Everyone discusses the final decision together, down to the precise wording.
Paimon: Alright! Paimon's got it! Let's go tell everyone else what we came up with!
Traveler: The victory speech is yours to make, Paimon.
Paimon: Ahem... this is Paimon's first time speaking to so many people from a stage like this. Paimon's getting butterflies...
Paimon: #Paimon and Traveler are super happy that we were lucky enough to win this tournament and even expose a criminal conspiracy while we were at it. The responsibility for continuing to hold this tournament in the future now lies in our hands.
Paimon: Now, they may have thrown the organizer and the sponsor in jail... but you can all breathe a huge sigh of relief, 'cause the prizes are still being issued as promised!
Ajilenakh Dash: Yessss! That's what I'm talkin' about, woop-woop!
Souka: That's a good call!
Paimon: However, unfortunately the Wisdom Orbs currently have a harmful effect on their surrounding environment, so they pose a risk to people's health. This means that we won't be able to keep our Fungi friends around for the long term.
Paimon: So for the sake of everyone's well-being, over the coming days, we recommend that everyone entrusts their Fungi into the care of the best darned beast-tamer in town, Haniyyah.
Paimon: But you won't be away from them for too long! While Haniyyah takes care of your Fungi, we'll be talking to the Akademiya with the goal of trying to resolve the current issues with the Wisdom Orb as soon as possible!
Paimon: And of course, this tournament was so much fun, it'd be a real shame if it was a one-off affair... Paimon's sure you've all got a big appetite for more Fungi fun and games!
Paimon: So once the technical issues are all sorted out, and we're all reunited with our Fungi friends, let's battle it out all over again!
Haniyyah: Oh, so THAT's my punishment?
Yae Miko: Think of it more as a reward for being the runner-up.
Layla: Don't think of it that way, Miss Haniyyah. Spending time with shroom buddies is actually really fun! Right, Twirly-Whirly?
Layla: I'm gonna miss you Twirly-Whirly... Take good care of my best shroom-buddy.
Haniyyah: #Traveler, Paimon, Layla, and Lady Kitsune... What can I say? You're a fascinating bunch...
Paimon: Come on, Haniyyah, we announced the official decision with everyone watching. You'd better look alive!
Haniyyah: Yeah, don't worry. I get it.
Haniyyah: As a beast-tamer, I accept your proposal. I will do my utmost to care for these Fungi, and treat them like the treasured companions that they are to their masters.
Paimon: Hehe, now those sound like the words of an awesome person called Haniyyah that Paimon wants to be friends with! Just wish you'd shown us this Haniyyah sooner.
Paimon: Anyway, let's spend some final quality time with our shroom buddies. Then we'll all meet up in Port Ormos!
Traveler: Time to put your gift of gab to good use!
Traveler: Haniyyah needs to see things differently.
Traveler: We'll leave the rest to you.
