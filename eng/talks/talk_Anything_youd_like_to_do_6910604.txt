Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Mavuika: Well, since you asked, I have an idea for a flamestrider Grand Prix!
Traveler: Whâ€”What was that?
Mavuika: Hahaha, I've been thinking about it ever since I arrived! It would be a shame not to take advantage of all this space and the amazing scenery.
Mavuika: So, this is what I was thinking... We create a race track that combines speed and technique and invite challengers to compete. The winner can be crowned the "Master of the Striding Flame."
Mavuika: If the tournament is a success, it would bring in a significant profit, in which case, you wouldn't need to worry about future prizes, and you could even expand the scale.
Traveler: I see where you're coming from, but...
Mavuika: Oh, don't worry. I already asked Xilonen about that. Although, she categorically refused...
Mavuika: I understand her reasoning, of course. I would need at least eight flamestriders, which would cost a small fortune, and I have no idea where we would find enough Secret Source components.
Mavuika: Still, having a vision is better than nothing. Besides, I have a back-up plan that only involves one rider.
Mavuika: Instead of having everyone ride a flamestrider at once, everyone will take turns with mine, and the person with the fastest time wins.
Mavuika: Of course, Xilonen rejected this proposal as well. The reason being, the flamestrider was originally designed for battle and travel, rather than speed.
Mavuika: Several modifications would need to be made to operate at high speeds, which means faster wear and tear, and more maintenance.
Mavuika: In short, we cannot sacrifice the core function of the flamestrider for our own entertainment.
Traveler: Xilonen makes a convincing argument...
Mavuika: Hm... True.
Mavuika: But, that also means... We could just design a new flamestrider built entirely for speed!
Mavuika: I'll make a quick sketch and show it to Xilonen right away!
Traveler: Do you have enough flamestriders for that?
