# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Kirara: Yes! There's something I've been meaning to ask you for a while.
Kirara: #Do you know what styles human girls are into these days?
Traveler: Um...
Kirara: Too sudden? My bad, my bad! Alright then, allow me to explain the situation from the beginning.
Kirara: As you're already aware, even though I am a youkai, I've been looked after by my human Granny since a very early age.
Kirara: It goes without saying that I've heard way more stories about humans than I did about the youkai. I've always looked forward to joining the colorful and warm world that is human society!
Kirara: But even after I managed to use my youkai powers to give myself a human form, I still didn't know how to fit in. It would be a bit awkward for me to still dress and act like a nekomata when I'd already changed my look...
Kirara: I began to observe human girls to see what they liked to wear. It seemed to me that everyone really liked bows and flowers...
Kirara: And so, I added a ton on my own clothes!
Traveler: They look really cute on you!
Kirara: You really think so? Aw, thanks! *purr*
Kirara: So um... would you be willing to accompany me to go on a little shopping spree whenever you're free?
Kirara: I'd love to buy some cute accessories, and with an expert like you by my side, nothing can go wrong!
Traveler: You could add a few more accessories to match with your outfit.
Kirara: Whoa! A fashion connoisseur? I knew I came to the right person!
