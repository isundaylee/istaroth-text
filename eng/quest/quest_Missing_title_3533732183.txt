## Talk 1

Venier: A hundred and thirty-six... Alright, fourteen more times, and we'll take a break!
Traveler: Do you need a hand?
Venier: A hand? No, no need. What training requires the assistance of another?
Venier: Only by honing my physique can I join Legion Athanatoi as one of its sublime soldiers, just like this officer here!
Venier: ...
Venier: Ah yes, introductions are in order! This is my instructor. Only by clearing the tests he sets can I earn the right to ascend.
Traveler: Um, isn't this just a statue?
Venier: What are you saying, citizen? Are not all Remurians this way?
Venier: In any case, would you like to have a go? The initial test involves the simultaneous smashing of these stone pillars.
Venier: Don't underestimate them, however! Even with all my training, I can only shatter one with a single punch.
Traveler: Tests? What tests?
Venier: Combat tests, naturally. An ascendant, immortal form is one thing, but combat skills must be honed of one's own accord.
Venier: In any case, would you like to have a go? The initial test involves the simultaneous smashing of these stone pillars.

## Talk 7

Venier: Huh... So that's how you chose to handle it...
Venier: Truly splendid. Have you previously served in our God King's armies, by any chance?
Venier: ...
Venier: Our fine officer also praises your performance! It seems I must work harder!
