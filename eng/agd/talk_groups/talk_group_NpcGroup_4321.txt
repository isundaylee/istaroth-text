## Talk

Amadhiah: I hope the children of Vimara Village will grow up safely... Huh? Is someone here?

## Talk

Traveler: Your vision...
Amadhiah: Oh, my apologies. Now that I'm getting on in years, my eyes are not as sharp as they used to be. Everything is a blurry shadow to me. Luckily, my ears still work well...
Amadhiah: Are you a guest resting in Vimara Village, too? It doesn't matter where you're from, welcome to Vimara Village.

## Talk

Traveler: About the children...
Amadhiah: Oh, they are all good children, always full of energy... I wish them the blessings of Lesser Lord Kusanali. One day, they will grow up, safe and healthy.

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry for the trouble.
Amadhiah: No worries, no worries. You are all welcome in Vimara Village.

## Talk

Amadhiah: It's Rana's little guest. Well, Rana is a good guide, isn't she?

## Talk

Traveler: Your vision...
Amadhiah: Oh, my apologies. Now that I'm getting on in years, my eyes are not as sharp as they used to be. Everything is a blurry shadow to me. Luckily, my ears still work well...
Amadhiah: I'm really sorry about before...

## Talk

Traveler: About the children...
Amadhiah: Oh, the "tiger cubs"? They are all good children, always full of energy... I wish them the blessings of Lesser Lord Kusanali. One day, they will grow up, safe and healthy.

## Talk

Traveler: About Rana...
Amadhiah: Rana... *sigh* She's been a smart girl since childhood... but sometimes she is too headstrong.
Amadhiah: After becoming a Forest Watcher, she's returned to the village less often. Forest Watchers are busy, I understand that. I'm just worried if she's getting enough rest...

## Talk

Traveler: About your past...
Amadhiah: Those are all stories of the past. I gave up on becoming an adventurer, but I don't regret it...
Amadhiah: Every person has their own path in life...

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Amadhiah: Well then, I won't keep you any longer...
Amadhiah: Oh, one more thing, little guest. If you ever meet Rana, please remind her to take more rest...

## Talk

Amadhiah: It's Rana's little guest. Oh, if you're looking for Rana, she's gone on a trip and won't be back for a while.

## Talk

Traveler: About Rana...
Amadhiah: She returned all of a sudden, saying she was to "go on a trip with a very, very important friend"...
Amadhiah: She sounded very serious... Only those who have traveled understand the meaning of a journey. I hope she'll find what she's been looking for...

## Talk

Traveler: About the musical instrument...
Amadhiah: That instrument, huh? You can have it.
Amadhiah: It belongs to wayfarers who travel like the wind. But it's been by my side for too long.
Amadhiah: Please let it sing in the woods, I guess that won't let the poet lady's goodwill go to waste...

## Talk

Traveler: About your past...
Amadhiah: Those are all stories of the past. I gave up on becoming an adventurer, but I don't regret it...
Amadhiah: Every person has their own path in life...

## Talk

Traveler: About Alphonso...
Amadhiah: That child, Alphonso... Why did he leave without a word? He lived in Vimara Village for many years. Everyone says he's a good child...

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Amadhiah: Well then, I won't keep you any longer...

## Talk

Traveler: He might never come back again...
Amadhiah: *sigh* He is a good child. Sometimes, he seemed preoccupied with something. I felt I was not in the position to ask...
Amadhiah: I hope he will stop worrying about those things in the future.
