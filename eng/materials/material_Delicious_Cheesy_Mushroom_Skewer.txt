# Delicious Cheesy Mushroom Skewer

A skewer covered in golden-brown, mouth-watering cheese. The mushrooms are almost as thick as steak. Although they don't smell like meat, the taste is far more splendid. A single bite blesses your whole mouth with the fragrant flavors packed within, as juicy joy overflows in abundance.
