Traveler: About the symphony on the mural...
Monsieur Os: Oh yeah, since Boethius has run off, guess we can finally play this mural symphony in peace!
Monsieur Os: This piece of music depicts the first legendary voyage of the Sebastos to the land called Meropis, guided by the oracle Sybilla.
Monsieur Os: This was the beginning of our ancient civilization, the beginning of all the stories that would follow.
Monsieur Os: It being recorded here means that that fellow believed that the principle of cycles would cause the old civilization to resurface, resulting in the drama playing out over and over.
Monsieur Os: But since it is a drama, then it needs a protagonist... and if you wish to enjoy the music, why don't you try playing the part?
Monsieur Os: Of course, the musical score here will be transferred onto the "blank score" you retrieved previously. You can then listen to the song at any time.
