Mingyun Village Billboard: "Rumors have been spreading about the recent discovery of the estate of Mr. Hong, the previous mine owner, including a letter, an alleged book collection and a treasure stash. Please take these rumors with a pinch of salt, and certainly do not let thinking about them impede your progress. Keep working hard."
Mingyun Village Billboard: "Also, due to the fact that bandits have recently been active in Dihua Marsh, please note that the arrival of the merchants' caravan is likely to be later than usual this month."

Mingyun Village Billboard: "While you are in the mine, be extra careful if the torches start burning blue — it could be a sign of volatile gases being produced deeper underground. It would be terrible if there was an explosion. I'd also like to take this opportunity to observe a moment's silence for our dear former comrade Erge."

Mingyun Village Billboard: "I am aware of the recent complaints that there are not enough finches to go round. Please be assured that arrangements are being made to procure some more; in the meantime, it is absolutely imperative that everyone is clear on the following points:"
Mingyun Village Billboard: "1 - Finches play a crucial role in the mining operation, because they can detect when the air is not safe to breathe."
Mingyun Village Billboard: "2 - In light of point 1, please refrain from cooking and eating the finches — however tasty you may find them to be."
Mingyun Village Billboard: "3 - Please, please do not forget the lesson to be learnt from the incident involving our dear former comrade Erge and Zhongyuan Chop Suey."

Mingyun Village Billboard: "Hey everyone, guess what? Remember Hong's letter? Well, I think I found a clue to his treasure in the mine today. It said something about red leaves and what-not. I couldn't make head or tail of it. Hong being the scholarly type, it was full of big words. Ah, if only our dear former comrade Erge were here!"
Mingyun Village Billboard: "Zhong, let it go already. Stop wasting time on this."

Mingyun Village Billboard: "Regarding the recent decline in the mine's output: I spoke with Mr. Dai. We both think the Mingyun Village mine is about to run dry."
Mingyun Village Billboard: "I just had a discussion with the people at the Huishan Hall. It's possible we will be transferred back to the Chasm soon to continue the work there. Please be assured there is no cause for concern."

Mingyun Village Billboard: "To Mr. Dai: I can't seem to find a copy of the latest volume of Heart's Desire anywhere. I'll have another look shortly."
Mingyun Village Billboard: "To Erge: I couldn't find you, so I gave the mushrooms, cabbage, cheese, flour and recipe you ordered to Zhong. He'll look after them for you."
Mingyun Village Billboard: "Hey everyone! Dinner's on me tonight — Mushroom Pizza for everyone!"
Mingyun Village Billboard: Mushroom Pizza! Yay!

Mingyun Village Billboard: "I found something Hong left in the mine. It mentioned some brothers and stuff. Might be something to do with the treasure he mentioned in that letter."
Mingyun Village Billboard: "But you should always put safety first in a treasure hunt. Same applies to mining. Remember to constantly knock on the rock of the tunnel ceiling — if it sounds like the rock is hollow, there's a high risk of a cave-in. I'd also like to take this opportunity to observe a moment's silence for our dear former comrade Erge."

Mingyun Village Billboard: "Hey everyone! Today's my last day in the mine. I'm getting married next week! Anyone who is free is more than welcome to join in the wedding celebrations — especially the libations!"
Mingyun Village Billboard: "So long, Mingyun Village! And farewell my friends! Write me if anyone finds Hong's treasure!"
Mingyun Village Billboard: "All the best to Zhong for the future! Everyone else — please, stop wasting time on treasure hunting. We are miners. Not adventurers. And certainly not Treasure Hoarders."
