# Bantan Sango Case File: The Search


## Talk 1

Ryuuji: Traveler, please wait. Sango would like your help.
Traveler: Making progress with the case?
Ryuuji: She didn't tell me. She just said that she still needed to make some preparations.
Ryuuji: She also told me to wait for you and ask if you would perform a search in the wilds together with me.
Traveler: What does she intend to accomplish?
Ryuuji: Well... to be honest, I have no clue either. But if we do what Sango tells us to, we can usually solve the case.
Ryuuji: Well. On that note, let's talk business.
Ryuuji: According to Sango, the patrol in the city has indeed been reinforced ever since Amano and Andou reported that incident.
Ryuuji: But strangely enough, the merchants in the city are still becoming victims of theft. And the perpetrators' intention is very clear. They aren't interested in anything else other than some targeted items.
Ryuuji: Here is the situation. Sango believes that the probability of the Treasure Hoarders sneaking into town to perform these crimes is very low.
Ryuuji: The suspect... or suspects, have a clear objective.
Ryuuji: It's very likely that there has been a mole inside the city this whole time, passing off information to people outside the city.
Traveler: Doesn't that mean the Doushins' actions are futile?
Ryuuji: Not at all. It's exactly what we want. Because our culprit seems to have realized that he is not the target of the Doushin yet, he will continue committing crimes.
Ryuuji: The more crimes he commits, the easier it is for him to give himself away, and greater the chance for Sango to figure out who he really is.
Ryuuji: Therefore, we still need to keep putting on a show so that our thief will let his guard down.
Ryuuji: Traveler, that's why I am here asking you to come with me and look for some trouble with those Treasure Hoarders in the wilderness.
Ryuuji: Of course, there will be payment. Also... when this case is over, there will be an additional gift for you.
Traveler: Did Sango ask you to say this stuff too?
Ryuuji: Hmm... you sensed that? You have quite a sharp intuition...
Ryuuji: It was indeed Sango who told me to persuade you with these words.
Ryuuji: But please believe me when I say that I am not lying. I am certainly carrying your payment with me, at least.
Ryuuji: Therefore, please help us out, Traveler.
Traveler: What exactly do you need me to do?
Ryuuji: It's easy. We just need... to mess with those Treasure Hoarders in the wilderness. The bigger the fracas, the better.
Ryuuji: Sango has already marked the locations of some Treasure Hoarder camps. I have also marked them on the map for you.
Ryuuji: Alright, we will rendezvous at this place afterward. Let's get a move on now.
Traveler: Why didn't she come along?
Ryuuji: It's her habit, really. She said that she... "is good at thinking, but less so at doing."
Ryuuji: A while ago, a novelist came to interview her, wanting to turn her story into a novel.
Ryuuji: He even referred to Sango as an "armchair detective." She seems to have taken a liking to this nickname, and has been thinking of buying an armchair since.
Ryuuji: But because of funding issues, we can't really get an armchair yet.

## Talk 2

Ryuuji: These people are quite quick to flee.
Ryuuji: They probably went back to report about us. In this case, our objective has been accomplished.
Ryuuji: Thank you for your hard work, Traveler. Please take these.
Ryuuji: I will also return and report to Sango about this.
Ryuuji: I wonder if she's figured something out yet...
