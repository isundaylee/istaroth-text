Traveler: Is your normal training not enough?
Keshen: No, no, no. Our routine training covers dozens of different items, such as basic marksmanship, defensive formation basics, moving in offensive formation, and more...
Keshen: There's nothing to complain about in terms of variety. Unfortunately, the target audience of the training is the majority. That is to say, ordinary soldiers.
Keshen: You'll need to find other ways if you want to become stronger after learning and mastering everything taught by this training.
Keshen: My goal in life is to defeat monsters like Xuanwen Beasts alone, but I have yet to receive Rex Lapis's approval and don't have a Vision.
Keshen: Therefore, I can only keep honing my martial arts and challenging my physical limits.
