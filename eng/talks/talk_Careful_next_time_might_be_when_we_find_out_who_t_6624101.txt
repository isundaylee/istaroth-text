Ohtli: Careful, next time might be when we find out who the winner really is.
Itotia: Couldn't look forward to it more.
Itotia: Let's hope you won't say "What a shame, it's a draw" again. I'm sick of hearing you say that.
Ohtli: It's not my fault that you can't beat more bad guys than I do.
Itotia: Allow me to remind you what the meaning of a draw is. It means I could say those words right back at you.
Ohtli: Then there's no point in fighting like this, is there? Let's just keep working hard, y'know? I mean, as opponents.
Itotia: What are you talking about? Of course we're opponents. I haven't reached the point where I need to team up with you yet.
