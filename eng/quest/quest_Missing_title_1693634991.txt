# Missing title (1693634991)

Traveler: Do you have anything else?
Linlang: Well, take this chunk of rock, for example. Looks perfectly ordinary, but in fact it came from a star.
Linlang: A very long time ago, a star fell from the sky. The force of the impact when it hit the ground is what turned it this color on the outside.
Linlang: Hmm? What do you mean, looks like a regular chunk of ore?
Linlang: ...Wait, no, you're right, sorry. I grabbed the wrong one. This is just a regular chunk of ore.
Linlang: Ugh, must be the suppliers. They're always trying to sneak the odd dud into the mix... so frustrating...
Linlang: Please, take it off my hands would you? I never want to see it again.
