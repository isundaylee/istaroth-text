# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Yun Jin: Yes, that would be perfect. I've been meaning to ask for your guidance on many things.
Traveler: You're so modest, Yun Jin.
Yun Jin: It's just that you've traveled extensively... you have much experience for me to draw upon.
Yun Jin: I must respect you if I wish to gain from your experience.
Yun Jin: Ahem, to be completely honest... There are times I have considered giving up the opera and taking time to travel around faraway nations. But things are always busy in the troupe and I've just never found the right opportunity.
Yun Jin: After traveling to so many places, I'm sure that you've learned many different customs. Would you mind sharing some with me?
Yun Jin: For example, the swordplay of the Knights in Mondstadt, what's that like? Does it differ from that of the martial artists we see in Liyue?
Yun Jin: I've also heard that the swords produced in Inazuma can cut through nearly anything... How do they forge such sharp swords?
Traveler: The knights of Mondstadt are masters of Favonius Bladework.
Yun Jin: A fighting style that flows like the wind? I wonder, are they capable of even manipulating the wind in combat?
Yun Jin: I want to hear all that you have to say! It truly is fascinating.
Yun Jin: I'll be sure to prepare some more questions for the next time we talk.
Yun Jin: Of course, I'll be sure to make our conversations worth your time as well. I will prepare an appropriate gift for you as thanks for answering my questions.
Traveler: The smithies in Inazuma forge their blades from Jade Steel...
Yun Jin: Oh, that must be a very special material, then... It's no wonder that the people of Inazuma are reputedly confident in their craftsmanship.
Traveler: You're so formal sometimes, Yun Jin.
Yun Jin: Haha, is this humor of yours also something that you've acquired throughout your travels?
Yun Jin: Then I won't beat around the bush.
