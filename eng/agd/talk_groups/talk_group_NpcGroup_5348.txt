Goldoni: Those auxilia of barbarian stock are spreading over-wrought rumors about those "Lochknights" again.
Goldoni: I should suggest to Dominus Boethius that we stamp these ridiculous ravings out completely.

Traveler: And you are...
Goldoni: Hmm? Ah, no need for surprise, citizen. As you see, I am a musician elevated by the Sebastos, yet I am a citizen, just as you are.
Goldoni: Marcia Gordiana Semproniana am I, here by the eminent will of Dominus Boethius to take over from my colleague, Xavierius, and tune the melodies of this land.

Traveler: About the Lochknights...
Goldoni: Fret not about the lies those slaves tell. Their so-called Lochknights are but facetious far-fetched fictions.
Goldoni: They spread rumors and call those barbarians who worship a false god "knights," believing that they shall one day free them from their fated duties.
Goldoni: I do not condemn such folly, for folly is the way of the lowly. Yet their delusions are fanned ever hotter, such that their melodies are tranquil no longer.
Goldoni: They must be cured. Once the disturbances here have subsided, I shall act forcefully to correct such strange skeins of supposition.
Goldoni: Delusion and weakness both breed turmoil.

Traveler: Goodbye.
Goldoni: Fare well, citizen. May your slaves be meek, and your song serene.

Traveler: Are you an ascended musician, then?
Goldoni: Indeed, that is so. A flawless body, immortal life, and absolute beauty. Behold, citizen. You look upon the honor bestowed on me by the Sebastos.
Goldoni: He has caused our bodies to transcend lowly mortality, turning the tragic dirge of death into proud triumph.
Goldoni: It is by this grace that I have the honor of performing the eternal symphony.

Traveler: About Boethius...
Goldoni: Watch your tone, citizen. Even I do not have the right to address that exalted Dominus solely by his name.
Goldoni: Dominus Boethius is a Harmost, exalted to that post by the Sebastos himself, and is the foremost genius in our empire's history. Even Dominus Cassiodor cannot...
Goldoni: ...No, forget what I said before. I did not mean to be partisan about our Harmosts.
Goldoni: Regardless, even amongst the empire's outstanding subjects, Dominus Boethius stands tall as the most representative of its spirit.
Goldoni: His loyalty and passion are undoubtedly worthy of our imitation and respect.

Traveler: About the Xavier you mentioned...
Goldoni: Xavierius, citizen, or Lucius Septimius Sebelius. Not "Xavier." Your pronunciation is most strange.
Goldoni: He was a respectable man, but he put his faith in the wrong thing. Inconceivably, he believed...
Goldoni: No, he twisted Dominus Cassiodor's words, to the point that he did not notice the barbarians' schemes in time.
Goldoni: Just as you have heard, his negligence caused the fall of Petrocorii. Countless citizens were massacred by the barbarians, and the streets were awash with ruin and blood in a single night.
Goldoni: Weakness only brings calamity, and kindness, disaster. Our ignorant slaves may be swayed by well-meaning lies, but our vision should extend further.

## Talk 4

Traveler: And you are...
Goldoni: Hmm? Ah! Sorry, I was just thinking about my script, and I started talking to myself...
Goldoni: I'm Goldoni. I suppose you could consider me a playwright. And as for what I just said... It wasn't anything important. Don't worry about it!

## Talk 5

Traveler: About the script...
Goldoni: Aye, it's a script for the next film festival.
Goldoni: To be honest, Xavier, the Furina Award-winning producer from the first festival is my... friend.
Goldoni: I agreed to his request to write his next script.
Goldoni: *sigh* If we weren't such long-time acquaintances, I wouldn't have turned down a commission from the Opera Epiclese to write him a script gratis!
Goldoni: And he said he'd pay me... Seriously, who does he take me for...
Goldoni: Still, I've only written opera scripts in the past. It wasn't until I started writing that I realized how different writing for films is.
Goldoni: For example, operas don't usually describe the finer details of a character's movements, but films require you to supply a complete description of the Kamera and visual angles...
Goldoni: Whatever the case, this commission is a brand-new challenge. That's why I'm still trying to decide what the best theme might be...

Traveler: You just said you wanted to write a classic romance story...
Goldoni: *cough* I—Isn't that very normal? After all, romance and love have been a theatrical theme since time immemorial! I didn't mean anything else, really!
Goldoni: As my ancestor... Master Coppelius once said...!
Goldoni: "There is no absolute good or evil, only absolute beauty and ugliness. And that which makes beauty is eternal love..."
Goldoni: Whether it be the chronicle of Chariclea or the legend of the Lochknights, these are all romantic classics...
Goldoni: Wh—Whatever the case, don't misunderstand, you hear?

### Talk 5 related talk 1

Traveler: Are you Xavier's friend?
Goldoni: Y... Yes! A—Also, we grew up together. I've known him since I was three!
Goldoni: *sigh* If only I knew the first thing about mechanisms. That way, I could've gone with him to Inazuma without anyone batting an eyelid...
Goldoni: Maybe I'd even be able to join his Daydream Club and speak with him more...
Goldoni: *cough* I mean, I could write more work that suits his requirements. I mean, the more commissions I do for him, the more perfect the scripts I'll write... right?

## Talk 6

Goldoni: Farewell. Safe journey!

Traveler: But you look like an ordinary person...
Goldoni: Is that so? Thank you for your praise, citizen. Still, you should direct that adoration to the might and mercy of the Sebastos.
Goldoni: To carve immortal bodies from stone that look no different from ordinary mortals — who else but he could have achieved this great feat?

Traveler: Coppelius?
Goldoni: Yes. Master Coppelius is the greatest playwright in Fontaine's history, and I... am a descendant of his, though my skill is far from comparable to his.
Goldoni: From "Golden Hyperborea" to "Coppelia" to "Masque of the Great," his works — one and all — rank amongst the greats.
Goldoni: If only I could be so incandescently artful, I... No, nothing, please, pay it no mind!

### Talk 10 related talk 1

Traveler: I'm sure the producer will like it.
Goldoni: Thank you. *sigh* If only he would like more than just scripts...
Goldoni: Uh, I—I mean, if only he... if only this would make him like traditional opera more...

## Talk 15

Goldoni: Perhaps we should choose more classical romance for the script this time. The confession of love between Tancrede and Chariclea, perhaps, or the farewell of the Lochknight Drest and Adsiltia...
Goldoni: *sigh* If only he could understand my intent...
