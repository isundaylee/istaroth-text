Traveler: A—achoo!
Manie: Haha, a little spicier than you're used to, right?
Manie: All the top chefs in Liyue love them — they're spicy, but refreshing, and don't have any of the usual side effects.
Manie: I'll pick up some black pepper and fowl when I get back, then I can make Jueyun Chili Chicken for the kids.
Traveler: What's Jueyun Chili Chicken?
Manie: Cooked Fowl, left to cool, then seasoned with Black Pepper and Jueyun Chilis. Easy to whip up and delicious to eat.
Manie: The Jueyun Chili is what really makes the dish. Without it, Jueyun Chili Chicken doesn't really taste of anything.
