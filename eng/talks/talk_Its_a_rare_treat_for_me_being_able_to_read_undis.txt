Sangonomiya Kokomi: It's a rare treat for me, being able to read undisturbed in a quiet place like this.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: On Watatsumi Island, as the Divine Priestess, every action I take is the subject of scrutiny and speculation. I have to show some restraint so that my personal preferences don't unduly influence everyone else.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: But here, I feel like I can relax a little. Umm... You won't mind if I suddenly laugh out loud while I'm reading, will you?
