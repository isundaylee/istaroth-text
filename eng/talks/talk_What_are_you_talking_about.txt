# Talk Dialog

Traveler: What are you talking about?
Arapandu: #Ah, it's Nara Traveler.
Arapandu: #Nara Traveler healed Varuna Contraption, so the trees and seeds are lively again.
Arapandu: #That's why we are naming Varuna Contraption as Traveler Contraption, to show our thanks.
Arapandu: But that would break Nara Varuna's heart, if Nara Varuna comes back.
Arapandu: #So Arapandu is trying to make Nara Traveler and Nara Varuna happy together.
