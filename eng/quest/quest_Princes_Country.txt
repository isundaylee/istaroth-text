# Prince's Country


## Talk 1

Freminet: Is your child feeling any better?
Zuria Destree: Thank you for your concern, Freminet. His condition is fairly stable. The family doctor said we might be able to take him out for a stroll today.
Paimon: Zuria! Freminet! We're here.
Zuria Destree: Hehe, seems like everyone's arrived now.
Paimon: Not quite, aren't we missing someone? But Paimon has a guess where he might be!
Paimon: Hey! Thelxieeee!
Thelxie: -.. -... . -- -...?
Paimon: Whoa! Thelxie's got himself a sword and a shield now! He's lookin' sharp.
Zuria Destree: Indeed, with his weapons in hand, Thelxie looks more formidable than ever. You've really outdone yourself, Freminet.
Paimon: We helped, too!
Freminet: Yes, you really had a good eye for materials. Everything you found was high quality.
Freminet: Speaking of which, Zuria just told me that she wants to end the adventure with a coronation ceremony. So, could I also trouble you with finding some materials for the crown?
Freminet: You can just keep an eye out for them on our way to the ruins. I was planning to collect the materials myself, but then I realized you might be able to find some prettier ones than what I could get my hands on.
Traveler: Consider it done.
Paimon: Seems like everything's ready to go. Shall we head out?
Zuria Destree: Please wait a moment. I was just thinking... Since Thelxie has already shown us his brand-new appearance, we may already be able to draw a new page in the picture book. What do you think?
Paimon: Ooh! Paimon's excited now!
Traveler: What should we draw on the page?
Freminet: Hmm, why don't we use the story we know as a reference? Just make the atmosphere a bit less grim...
Paimon: So we'll take out the sad parts and replace them with happier stuff? Sounds great to Paimon.
Zuria Destree: Alright, I'll give it a try. I'm not very adept at drawing, but I've seen a lot of art during my work. Now, as for the actual content of the drawing... please tell me what you'd like to see.
Freminet: Let me think... We can draw the weapon. The prince has picked up the sword of courage and the shield of perseverance, which proves he has crossed the mire of doubt, and is now ready to wage war against the darkness.
Zuria Destree: Okay, I'll add the weapon... Anything else?
Paimon: Paimon wants to give him some friends! Thelxie's got some friends by his side now, so he's no longer fighting alone.
Zuria Destree: Okay, I'll also draw some companions... Anything else?
Traveler: Don't forget to add some color.
Zuria Destree: Color. Ah, color... Yes! That's really important. The road in front of him now will no longer be just greyscale, but bursting with color and hope.
Zuria Destree: Who would've thought the page could have become so inspiring... How wonderful. Splendid ideas, everyone.
Paimon: Great! Everyone looks super pumped up, Thelxie most of all!
Zuria Destree: Are you seeing this, my son? Are you feeling inspired by this as well?
Thelxie: -.-  ..-.   ..-  -...  .---  -.  ..-. -.  -...  -.  -...  ---
Freminet: I'm sure he is, Zuria, and this is still just the first page.
Paimon: That's right, Paimon can't wait to see the picture book when it's all finished! We should finish it as soon as possible, and keep up the belief and hope in our hearts!
Zuria Destree: Mhm! I'm starting to look forward to it as well, so let's get this show on the road and head towards the Kingdom of Water Imps!
Paimon: Yay! Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures begin now!

## Talk 2

Paimon: So these are the underwater ruins that Freminet found... They're pretty amazing, but still not exactly the kind that Paimon was imagining...
Traveler: This is the Kingdom of Water Imps, Paimon, not ruins...
Paimon: Oh yeah, Paimon knows, it's just... Paimon thought we'd actually see a fairytale world, like with the Water Imps' colorful houses, and the rainbow bridge...
Freminet: I'm sorry... I was hoping to put up some decorations but ran out of time to do it by myself.
Traveler: It's okay, it's fantasy time now!
Paimon: Whoa! Someone's already switched into fantasy mode!
Zuria Destree: #Seems like {NICKNAME}'s already got the gist of things. You should do your best too, Paimon.
Paimon: Ah, don't underestimate Paimon! Paimon can flip the switch, too. Now entering... Paimon Fantasy Mode!
Paimon: Ahem... Young adventurers! 'Tis Paimon, Guardian Goddess of this land. State your goals and intentions for visiting this nation!
Freminet: Uh...
Zuria Destree: We are the companions of Prince Thelxie, Your Divine Highness. We have come to help him reclaim the glory that he has lost.
Paimon: Ooh! Reclaiming your glory! Thy goddess here has golden glory, silver glory, and bronze glory. Which is it that the prince has lost?
Zuria Destree: Huh?
Freminet: Uhh...
Traveler: Did you break character, Paimon?
Paimon: Not at all! This is the goddess's test! From your responses, the goddess has concluded that you're all brave adventurers without the taint of greed in your hearts! As such, you are worthy of everyone's respect!
Paimon: So, please accept the goddess's reward. The goddess will now bestow all three types of glory upon you!
Paimon: And as for this prince... the goddess will also bestow upon you the rainbow glory, so your future will always be filled with light!
Thelxie: -.. -... .-- -...?
Zuria Destree: My gratitude to Your Divine Highness for such generous blessings. Power is now surging through every part of my body.
Freminet: Me... Me too... Is this the divine inspiration of legend?
Traveler: All thanks to the power of Goddess Paimon!
Paimon: Hehe! Ahem... now adventurers, forge bravely ahead and defeat the monsters that have taken over the kingdom! You will be sure to find that which you seek!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Phew, it's finally over! So, have we defeated the evil monsters and reclaimed the Kingdom of Water Imps?
Zuria Destree: Yes, it should now be time for us to attend Thelxie's coronation ceremony... The only thing is, I didn't expect this to go so smoothly. I thought it would have taken longer for us to reach the heart of the ruins...
Zuria Destree: It was my mistake. I should have told Freminet earlier that we would also need a crown...
Paimon: #It's all because {NICKNAME} and Goddess Paimon were too strong! We just eradicated all the monsters in one go.
Freminet: It's okay, Zuria. We can come back again once I've made the crown.
Zuria Destree: Then I must thank all of you again for taking the time. And you too, Thelxie, my child.
Thelxie: -.-  ..-.   ..-  -...  .---  -.  ..-. -.  -...  -.  -...  ---
Paimon: Thelxie's turning out to be a real expert at fighting!
Freminet: I don't think there's anything that will be able to stop him... He's like a true prince now.
Zuria Destree: Yes, I agree as well!
Freminet: #Let's head back to camp for now. I asked {NICKNAME} to search for some materials on the way because I want to make the crown as soon as possible.
Paimon: We can add an update to Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures as well! Now that we've reclaimed the Kingdom of Water Imps, it's time for us to draw some new scenes in the picture book.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Zuria and Freminet, why don't we draw the new pages first? Paimon really wants to update the picture book!
Traveler: You just want to see someone draw Godddess Paimon...
Paimon: Hey! You didn't have to say it out loud!
Zuria Destree: Haha, no problem, I'm happy to oblige. Then in that case, the story today should go something like this...
Zuria Destree: After overcoming many obstacles, Prince Thelxie and his brave companions finally arrived at the entrance to the Kingdom of Water Imps.
Zuria Destree: At this time, the little fairy in the group, Paimon, revealed her true goddess form to her companions.
Paimon: Woohoo! The Goddess has arrived! She praised the companions for their purity, and to reward them, she bestowed upon them many blessings, and even prayed that the Prince would be able to fulfill his goal!
Zuria Destree: Bathed under the Goddess' glory, the Prince and his companions charged into the bastion of evil, chased away the monsters, and rescued the pretty Water Imps from their imprisonment. The Prince finally managed to reclaim his kingdom, but as for the crown...
Paimon: Oh no, the crown isn't ready yet!
Freminet: No... The crown was within the Prince's reach, but the monsters took it with them as they fled. They haven't given up and are sure to return, but the prince is certain to reclaim the crown the next time they fight. The brilliant rainbow shall descend onto the kingdom once more...
Paimon: Oh, and Paimon can almost see it all happening now!
Paimon: Whoa, the pages are beautiful... Zuria is really talented at drawing...
Zuria Destree: Thank you, everyone. We've also completed the second page of the picture book now. Thelxie's journey is one step closer to its end and the promised coronation...
Zuria Destree: My child... You'll also be able to brighten up when that time comes, right?
Thelxie: -.-  ..-.   ..-  -...  .---  -.  ..-. -.  -...  -.  -...  ---
Paimon: Paimon's sure he will, Zuria! Who knows, perhaps the doctor will already have some good news for you when you get back home today!
Zuria Destree: I sure hope so, Your Divine Highness. Oh, Freminet, about the time you'll need for the crown...
Freminet: Please don't worry. One day should be more than enough.
Zuria Destree: Ah, then I must thank you for your hard work. Alright, let's rendezvous here in another two days' time for our final adventure, okay?
Traveler: Sounds good to me.
Zuria Destree: Then see you in two days, my lovely friends. ♪♫♪~
Zuria Destree: ♪♫♪~
Paimon: Alright, it's about time we start heading off, too. You've still got some work to do, right Freminet?
Freminet: Yeah, I'll need to go to the city shortly to get some parts for the base of the crown. I want to try out a few different designs and choose the one that looks the best.
Traveler: Freminet's really dedicated.
Traveler: Freminet's working really hard.
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon knew that you didn't often take commissions from others... But Paimon had no idea you'd be so dedicated once you're on the job.
Freminet: Ah, well about that... It might be because...
Paimon: Uh... Because what...?
Freminet: It's because... I hope...
Paimon: Ah, what's the matter? And what's with that look on your face? You're turning red... and it looks like you're about to run away and put your helmet on again!
Freminet: Ahh! Am I turning red?
Traveler: Don't tease Freminet, Paimon.
Paimon: Hehe, alright, alright... We won't bother you anymore for today, Freminet. Let's see each other in two days' time!
Freminet: ...Okay, thank you... See you in two days.
Traveler: See ya.
Freminet: ...I hope that everyone who's found themselves in a dark place would be able to see something beautiful, and experience a miracle for themselves...
