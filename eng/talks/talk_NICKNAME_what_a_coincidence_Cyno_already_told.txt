Tighnari: #{NICKNAME}, what a coincidence! Cyno already told me everything that happened.
Traveler: About Cyno's unfunny jokes...
Tighnari: I'll stop you right there! Cyno has already told me countless jokes with that smug look on his face. I don't want to hear any more.
Tighnari: That's all I have to say on that topic.
Traveler: About Genius Invokation TCG...
Tighnari: Things have been quiet in the Avidya Forest lately, so I've been playing with Collei every now and then.
Tighnari: Collei never ceases to amaze me. She even managed to place well in that tournament.
Tighnari: Even though I was able to make it out of the qualifiers, luck wasn't on my side and I faced Cyno only a few matches in.
Tighnari: That guy shows no mercy when it comes to Genius Invokation. He even let out a loud yell when he played the winning card... It really hurt my ears.
Tighnari: It's been a while since I've seen him get so stirred up like that.
Traveler: I'll be on my way, then.
Tighnari: No need to be so polite. You should visit again when you have the time.
