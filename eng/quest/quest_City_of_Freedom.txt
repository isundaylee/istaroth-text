# City of Freedom


## Talk 1

Amber: Let me officially introduce the city of wind, dandelions, and freedom —
Amber: Travelers under the protection of the Knights of Favonius — Welcome to Mondstadt!
Paimon: Finally, no more having to camp outdoors!
Paimon: But... the city folk don't look too cheery.
Amber: Everyone's been put out of place by Stormterror recently.
Amber: But everything will turn out fine as long as Jean's with us!
Paimon: Jean?
Amber: Acting Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius — Jean, Defender of Mondstadt.
Amber: With Jean on our side, surely even the vicious Stormterror will be no match for us.
Traveler: (Sounds like someone pretty impressive...)
Amber: #Before I take you guys to the Knights of Favonius Headquarters, I have a present for you, Traveler.
Amber: It's a reward for helping me clear out that hilichurl camp.
Paimon: He-Hey! Why doesn't Paimon get a reward?
Amber: Ahh... Because this reward is useless to you, Paimon.
Amber: But I'll treat you to a traditional Mondstadt delicacy — Sticky Honey Roast.
Paimon: Sticky Honey Roast!
Amber: Come with me, we'll head to the city's ahh... *high ground*.
Traveler: (I hope she knows something about the God of Anemo)

## Talk 2

Amber: So, the present I want to give you is...
Amber: A *Wind Glider*!
Amber: Outriders use them to ride the wind, and the people of Mondstadt love using them too.
Amber: I brought you here to give it to you so you can experience it right away!
Paimon: Oh, you're really excited about these wind gliders, huh!
Amber: Well that's because the wind is the heart and soul of Mondstadt!
Amber: Alrighty then, enough talk! Let's give it a whirl!
Amber: It's easy to use, but you still need to pay attention to my instructions.
