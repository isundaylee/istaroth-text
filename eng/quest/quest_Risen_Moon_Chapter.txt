# Risen Moon Chapter


## Talk 1

Aragaru: Golden Nara and White Floaty, you are here! I am Aragaru!
Aragaru: Plants and mushrooms told me you would come, I have waited a very long time!
Paimon: Eh...? You know us...? Do you need us for something?
Aragaru: Yes! Something big, very big!!!
Paimon: Whoa, slow down. Take your time.
Aragaru: Marana is growing, bigger and bigger. Forests are afraid to speak, afraid to breathe... Marana wants to eat them...
Aragaru: To stop Marana, Aranaga is busy preparing the Arahaoma ritual. But Arahaoma... still needs the Barsam Flower.
Paimon: Paimon sees... But where can we find this Barsam Flower?
Traveler: Paimon, you got the name right this time.
Paimon: Heehee, Baaaarsaaam Flooower! Impressive, huh?
Aragaru: The Barsam Flower is at where mushrooms grow. The place was Nara's home many, many moonrises and moonsets ago.
Aragaru: But then... wet dirt covered Nara's dreams, and new plants grew in their memories. They were dried up and reborn generation after generation... That is the kind of place we want to go.
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon doesn't quite understand, but it sounds pretty scary.
Aragaru: Not scary, not scary. Plants love places Nara are scared of. So, lots of plants there.
Aragaru: There are runes left by Nara and Aranara there, for not forgetting and for recalling after forgetting. Go there and find the Barsam Flower!
Paimon: Hmm... Then let's go to the place Aragaru's talking about!
Aragaru: Oh, right! And also Kusava!
Aragaru: With Kusava, Aranara strong, strong! Can clear the path for everyone! Aragaru can smash the rocks! Hah! Yah! Boom!
Paimon: Aragaru is so tiny, but so strong!
Aragaru: Hehe, yes, very strong! Hmm... But it has to be a cracked rock with green vines. Ones with no cracks, not strong enough to smash them.
Traveler: What's "Kusava"?
Aragaru: Kusava holds memories and dreams. It is chubby, bitter, and full of power. It is the fruit of flowering plants, and also the seed of new life.
Aragaru: This, for you. Take good care of it. Aranara only give this to important ones, so... do not eat it!
Aragaru: Hmm... Moon comes and goes, not much left now... Walking Shroom-Kin are always inside, increasing now... This is very bad, we must hurry.
Traveler: What's "Barsam Flower"?
Aragaru: Barsam Flower is Aranara's good friend and is born for Arahaoma. It is the source of the potion. Hmm... have to sacrifice juice to refine Arahaoma.
Traveler: It must be hard to find.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Ahhh! *cough* *cough* *cough* Wh—Why did so much water gush out!? Paimon almost got drowned!
Traveler: So cold.
Aragaru: Because the Realm of Khab is the Barsam Flower's dream. When the Barsam Flower wakes up, the dream will disperse into the air.
Aragaru: So the weight of the water can't be withstood, and water will gush out! Whooo! Splash! Cool and refreshing.
Paimon: Hmph... Let's see if you could still say the same if Paimon was washed away and never found back!
Aragaru: Hehe, Aragaru knows where Nara and White Floaty are. Plants can also tell me where you've gone. You'll be found!
Aragaru: We have the Barsam Flower now, so next is to find the Zohrah Mushroom and the Yajna Grass before we can ask Aranaga to make the Arahaoma!
Traveler: We have the Zohrah Mushroom.
Aragaru: #Yes, thanks to Nara Traveler and White Floaty! If it were Aranaga, he'd definitely say, "Just like Nara Varuna, you are..."
Aragaru: #Hehe, that is to say, Nara Traveler and White Floaty are amazing!
Aragaru: Go find my friend Aranaga. He surely has something that needs your help! You can find him in the Mawtiyima Forest!
Paimon: All right, we got it!
Aragaru: Next... I'm going to the Mawtiyima Forest, too, to prepare for the Arahaoma ritual. Let's meet there!
Traveler: About Aranaga...
Aragaru: Aranaga is the eldest and most interesting of us three! He can say a lot of funny things and he knows a lot about Nara.
Aragaru: But he also forgot a lot about Nara... The three of us all have lots of things we can't remember. Some are scattered like pollen in the breeze, and some are blurred...
Aragaru: But Aranaga usually knows and remembers the most. That's why we like playing with Aranaga.
Aragaru: Aranaga is right in the gardens of the Mawtiyima Forest, watching over Mawtiyima. You'll definitely find him if you go there!
Traveler: So moist.
Traveler: So noisy...
Paimon: Hey!

## Talk 4

Aragaru: Here, look!
Paimon: What's this...? It looks like a child's drawing... What's it supposed to be?
Aragaru: Memory! Aranara memories can store in tubers, in seeds, can flow in leaf veins... But Nara memories are carved in the stones!
Aragaru: Hehe, whenever the moon is high up in the sky, the three of us Aranara would come here, recall stories from the past, just like Nara!
Paimon: Hmm... Then what's in this drawing?
Aragaru: It's not a drawing, it's a rune... It's a river of light, and in it are flower stems blooming with stars. The river and stars send us brave Nara.
Aragaru: The Grandmaster of Verdure cultivated the bud of wisdom in the hearts of brave Nara and let Aranara guide them... to the glimmering water cave.
Aragaru: Hmm... That's it. There are other runes nearby. Let's go and see them.

Aragaru: We have the Barsam Flower now, so next is to find the Zohrah Mushroom and the Yajna Grass before we can ask Aranaga to make the Arahaoma!
Traveler: We need two more plants...
Aragaru: #Yep! I have to go back to the Mawtiyima Forest and can't accompany Nara Traveler and White Floaty in your search for Aranakin... But Aranakin really likes to play near Nara territories.
Aragaru: Nara and white floaty must be careful. There are Naravaluka roaming about there. Aranakin calls them "sand"... You can't trust their words! They're bad!
Paimon: Got it. We'll be careful!
Aragaru: Next... I'm going to the Mawtiyima Forest, too, to prepare for the Arahaoma ritual. Let's meet there!
Traveler: About Aranaga...

Paimon: Hey!

## Talk 6

Aragaru: Golden Nara and White Floaty, you are here! I am Aragaru!

## Talk 7

Aragaru: The Realm of Khab is up ahead, outside the cave... But we must be careful on the way there.
Aragaru: This earth is where Nara sleep. Once here were stone homes Nara made. But after they fell asleep, plants came from their dreams and became owners of this place.
Paimon: Oh...
Aragaru: Does White Floaty understand?
Paimon: Not really...
Aragaru: Because Floaty is silly.
Traveler: I see...
Paimon: Hey, whose side are you on!?
Traveler: So, that's why...

## Talk 8

Aragaru: This is the place!
Paimon: But this is... blocked by vines? There's no way we can get in!
Aragaru: Hehe! Don't fret, White Floaty! Watch me.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Wow... How did you do that, Aragaru? Paimon wants to learn this!
Traveler: I don't think this sort of thing can be learned...
Aragaru: Heh, Aragaru can talk with vines, so the vines will make way for Aragaru! The language of vines is like singing. It's hard to learn for Nara... But if Nara wants to learn, I will teach you!
Paimon: Paimon wants to learn! Please do teach Paimon later, Aragaru!
Aragaru: Okay, if I don't forget you!
Traveler: I want to learn, too.

## Talk 10

Aragaru: This is the Realm of Khab! This is where plants' sweet dreams hide!
Aragaru: See? Growing over there is the Barsam Flower!
Paimon: Wow...
Traveler: It's so quiet here...
Paimon: Yeah, a little bit too quiet... Paimon is having goosebumps...
Aragaru: The Realm of Khab is very weak... Shroom-Kin came in, ate lots of nutrients, but the Barsam Flower is not hurt... Not yet.
Aragaru: Let's go lift his seal, then talk to him!
Paimon: Okay, we'll lift the seal. Then you can go talk to him!
Traveler: The Barsam Flower is here...
Paimon: Hmm... Why does it look so odd...?

## Talk 11

Paimon: Aragaru just needs to talk to the Barsam Flower, right?
Aragaru: Shh! Shh! Quiet, don't wake him.
Black Screen Text: Aragaru whispers with the Barsam Flower for a while...
Aragaru: The Barsam Flower was woken up from his dream by us, he is very angry.
Paimon: Eh?
Aragaru: But if it's for Arahaoma, then I suppose we can be forgiven.
Aragaru: Barsam Flower, Barsam Flower, for Arahaoma, for Mawtiyima's revival... Please join us.
Paimon: Huh? Oh... Ehh?
Traveler: What are you doing, Paimon?
Paimon: Paimon is trying to listen to the Barsam Flower's response!
Aragaru: Great! The Barsam Flower agreed to adventure with us!
Paimon: Yay! We got the Barsam Flower!
Aragaru: Hmm, and... the Barsam Flower said be careful with our heads.
Paimon: What does that mean?
Aragaru: Protect our heads and roots, or damage will be caused when water comes...
Paimon: Eh? Wait... What is that sound?
Aragaru: Watch out!
Traveler: Can you understand them?
Paimon: ...Paimon can't hear anything.
