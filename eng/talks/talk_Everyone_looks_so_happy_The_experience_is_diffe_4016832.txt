# Talk Dialog

Layla: Everyone looks so happy... The experience is different from gazing at the starry sky, but still... what a sight to behold.
Traveler: Layla?
Layla: Ah, it's you. Layla got a burst of energy after talking with you. She managed to finish her paper before the Festival without sleepwalking even once. But, she crashed as soon as it was submitted.
Layla: I saw her write this in the acknowledgement section...
Layla: "Interactions between stars can lend immense strength to involved bodies, to the point where they can even alter preexisting orbits..."
Layla: "Real life mirrors astronomy in this way. You never know what miracles can be achieved when two people seem to resonate at the same frequency. This author speaks from personal experience."
Layla: As for me... I'll take a picture to capture this moment and put it on her desk.
