## Talk

Neuvillette: #Ah, it's you, Traveler.
Neuvillette: I've been waiting for the owner to show up. One cannot simply walk around without first obtaining permission.

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Neuvillette: The scenery here is pleasant. It makes one feel happy.
Neuvillette: But I've been meaning to ask, does it never rain here?
Traveler: No, never.
Neuvillette: I see.
Neuvillette: Well, I suppose that makes sense... Worlds such as this are created as a sanctuary from wind and rain.
Neuvillette: Pay it no heed... it's nothing.
Traveler: But we do have Inazuman hot springs here.
Neuvillette: Oh, splendid.
Neuvillette: I've long heard tell of the hot springs in Inazuma. Did not expect that I'd see them here.
Neuvillette: Hm? You mean the water is just artificially heated?
Neuvillette: That's quite understandable. Even long ago, I had heard that there are no natural hot springs in Inazuma either, and that their current facilities were imported and developed by their treasury department.
Neuvillette: The experience is not much different from that of an authentic, natural hot spring.

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to chat?
Neuvillette: Of course, is there anything you would like to know?
Neuvillette: For example, my experiences of taste-testing the renowned springs of the world?
Traveler: Uh, unfortunately... I don't really have a taste for spring water.
Neuvillette: Ah, then you are missing out on a great many good things in life...
Neuvillette: Perhaps that can't be helped, some things come naturally to certain people, but not to others.
Neuvillette: Did you know that Vishaps lose the ability to distinguish colors over the course of their evolution?
Neuvillette: After the window of opportunity closes, they won't ever be able to enjoy colorful paintings again.
Neuvillette: Oh, I just learn things like this out of personal interest.
Traveler: I feel like I've heard this somewhere before...
Neuvillette: Two things I've learned from the story of Vishaps are:
Neuvillette: First, we must respect the differences between all species as well as all individuals within a species.
Neuvillette: And second, we mustn't squander the best years of our lives.
Neuvillette: How about you? Can you think of anything you should do when you are young, and not wait until you are too old and begin to regret it?
Traveler: To love others and be loved in return?
Neuvillette: Ah, an excellent answer. It exceeds my expectations.
Neuvillette: If only people could actually do that, it would be wonderful... Failure to do so only floods the world with sorrow.
Traveler: To travel all around the world?
Neuvillette: Hmm, a good answer.
Neuvillette: But I think it's never too late to do that. I'm also planning to travel the world in the future, you know.

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Neuvillette: If you mean what I'd like to do right now, I think I would enjoy taking a nice walk.
Neuvillette: But, if you're asking about the long-term, then I'd want all life to be able to live on in the original forms that are rightfully theirs.
Neuvillette: It's merely that... as of now, even existence in such a natural state must be fought for most fiercely.
Traveler: Sounds kinda intense.
Neuvillette: You're right. I'm saying that more for myself to hear than anything else.
Neuvillette: If you too find yourself subject to grave injustice, yet bound by rules that are twisted and warped...
Neuvillette: You must be willing to step up and right those wrongs.
Neuvillette: If you cannot break free from the eggshell, the world is naught but a prison where you are blinded and confined.
Neuvillette: Don't be afraid of bleak desolation and poverty outside the prison, and don't fret about your stable rations being cut off once the prison is destroyed.
Neuvillette: Outside that world... I'll always be waiting for you.
Traveler: Okay, I'll remember that.

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Iudex.
Neuvillette: Hello. You may forgo the formalities.
Neuvillette: The weather here always seems to be... pleasant.

Traveler: Good night, Neuvillette.
Neuvillette: #Good night, Traveler.
Neuvillette: Forget your troubles and enjoy a good night's rest.

Neuvillette: This bears a striking resemblance to the Fountain of Lucine. Sadly, the water here comes from a different source, so there is, of course, no way to replicate the taste.
Neuvillette: Nevertheless, prior experience tells me that to most people, the visual similarity alone would be enough to prompt them to say a phrase such as: "This area has a very Fountain of Lucine flavor."
Neuvillette: ...My cup is empty. May I avail myself of your fountain?

## Talk

Neuvillette: The office desk is, in my estimation, one of humanity's most eminently practical inventions.
Neuvillette: When receiving strangers, the presence of a physical boundary always proves more effective than a verbal reminder at encouraging disagreeable persons to act with relative decorum.
Neuvillette: And so, to me, the office desk is an item of great importance.
