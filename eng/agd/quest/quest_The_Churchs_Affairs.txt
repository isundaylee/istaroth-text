# The Church's Affairs


## Talk 1

Victoria: Sister Barbara... Where have you gone?

## Talk 2

Victoria: Oh, you're back again. If you're looking for Sister Barbara... she's yet to return.
Traveler: We found Barbara in Wolvendom.
Victoria: Oh, I see... Thank Barbatos that she's alright.
Victoria: But it sounds like she won't be back any time soon... Hmm, perhaps I'll have to pass her responsibilities in the Cathedral to someone else...
Traveler: We can help.
Victoria: Oh, well that's most kind of you. I certainly wouldn't want to trouble you...
Victoria: Hmm... Let me think for a moment... Ah yes, you could help tidy up around the Cathedral a bit.
Victoria: People tend to bring dust in as they come into the Cathedral, so the floor is often quite dirty.
Victoria: Cleaning and the like have always been Sister Barbara's responsibility... So the moment she's gone, everything starts getting dirty...
Traveler: Barbara is responsible for cleaning a place this huge by herself?
Victoria: Yes, that's right. She always said that she could handle it herself and that there's no need to ask anyone else to help her.
Victoria: But she does often appear quite exhausted after she's finished with the cleaning.
Victoria: To be honest, I'm most surprised that you are willing to help... Or rather, that Barbara is willing to let you help.
Victoria: However, this would help to lighten her burden.
Victoria: Anyway, I'll let you handle the cleaning for now, Honorary Knight.
Traveler: Barbara is at Dawn Winery checking on Tunner.

## Talk 3

Victoria: Your kindness will not go unnoticed, Honorary Knight. Barbatos bless you.

## Talk 4

Victoria: Yes, my child?
Traveler: About Barbara's time off...
Victoria: Oh yes, Sister Barbara just submitted her request for half a day's leave. She said she had plans with a friend.
Victoria: I must say though, it is quite unusual for Barbara to request time off just to see a friend...
Victoria: But that's beside the point. What is it you'd like to ask me?
Traveler: About "Fantastic Summer-Serendipity Coral Sparkling Tea"...
Victoria: Oh? You mean to tell me that Barbara intends to accompany you to buy this... special drink?
Victoria: Then you must be the friend that she mentioned, I presume?
Victoria: Hmm, seeing as you're the Honorary Knight, I guess that's fine...
Victoria: Well then, please take good care of Sister Barbara.
Traveler: Why does Barbara always have to report her plans?
Victoria: Well, as you may already know, Sister Barbara is quite popular in Mondstadt for several reasons...
Victoria: Although the citizens here may only be acting out of good intention, there are too many of them, and Sister Barbara can't handle it all.
Victoria: If they appear while she is working here at the Church, we can come and intervene.
Victoria: But if she's approached by fans during her time off, then she can only fend for herself.
Victoria: And not to mention, she's too... kind. She'll always try to fulfill the requests of the citizens of Mondstadt, even when it takes a heavy toll and leaves her more exhausted than actual working hours.
Victoria: So with that in mind, we thought we'd have Sister Barbara always tell us where she'd be, just in case we need to come rescue her from the crowds.
Victoria: My hope is that Sister Barbara stops pushing herself so hard...

## Talk 5

Victoria: Yes, my child?
Traveler: About Barbara's itinerary...
Victoria: Oh? Sister Barbara wishes to go to the Whispering Woods to pick herbs?
Victoria: I see... In fact, Sister Barbara just requested a half day's leave to go meet a friend. Now she suddenly intends to go herb-picking?
Victoria: I'm sure Sister Barbara has her reasons... Will you be accompanying her?
Traveler: Yes, I will be accompanying her.
Victoria: Ah, I trust she will be in good hands then. Please take good care of Sister Barbara, Honorary Knight.
Traveler: Why does Barbara always have to report her plans?
Victoria: Well, as you may already know, Sister Barbara is quite popular in Mondstadt for several reasons...
Victoria: Although the citizens here may only be acting out of good intention, there are too many of them, and Sister Barbara can't handle it all.
Victoria: If they appear while she is working here at the Church, we can come and intervene.
