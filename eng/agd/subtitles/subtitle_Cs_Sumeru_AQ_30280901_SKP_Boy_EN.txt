This is supposed to be a battle between gods, yet you choose to hide behind a mortal
And now, you're acting like you'd sacrifice yourself for a human...
Are you having fun proving a false sense of heroism to yourself, Buer?
The data collection is almost complete
Do you even know how many times you've tried to take my Gnosis from me?
We just concluded the 168th loop
Did you know that, in the effort to create you
The people of Sumeru were forced to live through the exact same number of Sabzeruz Festivals and samsara cycles?
The power of dreams... When did you use it on me...
You can't even defeat me in a dream
What do you hope to achieve with this little trick?
Come, Traveler, just like before
Allow me to awaken the memories in your dreams
All that battle experience!
It's more than that
"Compile everyone's wisdom in the name of the archon"
That is the original function of the Akasha
I've sent everything that happened just now
To the people of Sumeru in the form of knowledge
I've asked them... to help you find a way to defeat the false god
Now, all of Sumeru's wisdom is at your disposal
Meaningless tricks won't save you!
Heh... Are you done with your tricks?
Can I finally take this as a real battle between gods?
Mm, I'll leave this to you
The First Sage of Buer
