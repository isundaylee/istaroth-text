Traveler: May I ask who you are?
Ogura Mio: I am Ogura Mio, the owner of Ogura Textiles & Kimonos. Let me know if you need anything.
Ogura Mio: Ogura Textiles & Kimonos is a family-run store that has been around for a century. We sell high-class fabrics and the latest kimonos. Those upper-class samurai often come here as well. The quality of our merchandise is guaranteed.
Ogura Mio: I see that you are not dressed commonly either. I'd wager that you've probably seen much. So, would you like to try out some Inazuma-style outfits?

Traveler: What's the issue with the silks from Liyue?
Ogura Mio: Because of the Sakoku Decree, many merchants engaged in international trade have been forced to shutter their businesses. The same goes for the import-export fabric industry.
Ogura Mio: The dye houses of Ritou have closed down, and the dyes grown in Konda Village don't sell for good prices anymore.
Ogura Mio: Because of the difficulty in trading with Liyue, its price was driven up. It has also been out of stock for a long time, in any case.
Ogura Mio: In the past, one could touch the silk weaved from Silk Flowers and have a sneak peek at the exotic lifestyle of the upper class in other lands. Now, I have almost forgotten what that smooth texture feels like...

Traveler: How's business?
Ogura Mio: Thank you for asking.
Ogura Mio: Although stocks of fabric are a bit tight, We are a storied and well-known store after all. Our items are excellent and have a good reputation.
Ogura Mio: Furthermore, my brother is a sergeant serving in the Shogun's Army, so we have the honor of offering our services to many officials of the Tenryou Commission.
Ogura Mio: Most officers of the Tenryou Commission are high-class samurai, and they have many family members who often come here to purchase expensive, high-end kimonos. Our business is doing well thanks to them.

Traveler: Should have brought some from Liyue, I suppose.
Ogura Mio: Ah, have you been to Liyue before?
Ogura Mio: I was right after all. Judging from your outfit, I knew that you were a traveler from afar.
Ogura Mio: If you happen to come into possession of silk weaved from Silk Flowers at Liyue's Feiyun Commerce Guild, we will be happy to buy them for a reasonable price.

Ogura Mio: Long time no see. Please, come in.

Traveler: I'd like to thank you again for that commission last time.
Ogura Mio: You're welcome. It is the honor of Ogura Textiles & Kimonos to be able to make a customized outfit for Miss Kamisato.
Ogura Mio: In any case, I rarely see Miss Kamisato so casual and happy. You two must be truly close friends.
Ogura Mio: Ah, seeing how you're so close to Miss Kamisato, I'm getting curious as to what your story is, my dear customer.

### Talk 4 related talk 1

Traveler: So, how've things been going lately?
Ogura Mio: It's still the same. The last time I got my hands on Liyue silk was when I was making that outfit for Miss Kamisato. My brother is also still somewhere far away...
Ogura Mio: Ah, why am I saying these things to a customer? I'm sorry.
Ogura Mio: On the upside, business has been good and my brother is safe, so everything is going well.
Ogura Mio: If you ever run into my brother, please send him my regards. Thank you.

Traveler: How've things been going lately?
Ogura Mio: Things are going well. Thank you for asking.
Ogura Mio: With the trade routes re-opened, many customers have recently come to order silks. I have several pages' worth of names, in fact.
Ogura Mio: If you're looking to buy any now, I'm afraid that you might have to wait a few months.
Ogura Mio: *sigh* It's at times like these that I wish that my brother, stationed afar as he is, could return to help out...
Ogura Mio: Ah, why am I saying these things to a customer? I'm sorry.
Ogura Mio: If you ever run into my brother, please send him my regards. Thank you.

Ogura Mio: You jest again, dear customer... But since you insist on keeping it a secret, I will not pry.

Traveler: So, you mentioned your brother...
Ogura Mio: I have a samurai brother who is stationed afar and cannot return home yet.
Ogura Mio: Ever since my father's passing, the store that my brother should have been taking care of was left to me instead.
Ogura Mio: Although we cannot meet, we still keep writing to each other. I'm glad that we're aware of each other's well-being.
