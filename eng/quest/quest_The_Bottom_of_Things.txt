# The Bottom of Things

Zhouliang: Ugh... I'm beat. Finally, I can take a break.
Zhouliang: *sigh* I wonder if I took things a little too far... A few people seemed scared out of their minds.
Traveler: Who are you?
Zhouliang: Huh? Hey, you shouldn't be here!
Zhouliang: *sigh* Never mind. I assume you overheard me anyway.
Zhouliang: I work here pretending to be a ghost, but now's my break time, so I took off my costume. I get all hot and stuffy wearing that thing...
Traveler: So there are no real ghosts here?
Zhouliang: Of course, how could there be real ghosts here?
Zhouliang: No one wants to see a real ghost, neither us nor the participants.
Zhouliang: They just come here for the atmosphere, or should I say, the chance... Everyone wants the chance to feel the thrill of excitement.
Zhouliang: When people find themselves in a scary situation, they'll say things that they'd never dare to otherwise. That's what the Test of Courage is all about.
Traveler: I think I understand.
Zhouliang: *sigh* Okay... I should get back to work now. Hope you and... whoever you're here with have a fun time.
Traveler: (Chongyun will be very disappointed.)
Traveler: It's all planned to scare people, right?

Qianqian: Um... Can... C—Can you help me...?
Traveler: Help you?
Qianqian: Um, that exorcist... with that blue hair... is so scary!
Qianqian: C—Can you lead him away from here? He makes me feel so frightened...
Traveler: Are you being affected by his yang energy?
Qianqian: I wouldn't dare get anywhere near him... His energy... It's so horrible! It'll make me disappear!
Qianqian: ...I don't want to disappear! Please, help me...
Traveler: I wonder if he'd consider you an evil spirit...
Qianqian: ...Well... I—I have an idea.
Qianqian: Um... I—I saw the exorcist with blue hair a—arguing with someone over there a few minutes ago.
Qianqian: I'll scare those troublemakers away, but y—you have to ask the exorcist to let me go, okay?
Traveler: Are you telling the truth?
Qianqian: O—Of course... Qianqian never lies.
Qianqian: So, um... What do you say?
Traveler: He'll be the one that decides, but I'll try to explain the situation as best I can.
Qianqian: Um... Uh, okay... So, I'll take that as a "yes"?
Qianqian: I hope the exorcist with blue hair is a good person.
Qianqian: Um... So, I'll help him, and you'll go talk to him. Hopefully, then he'll leave me alone... Sound good?
Traveler: I can get him out of trouble myself.
Qianqian: ...Yeah but... it'll be complicated. I've already got a plan, you must believe me!
Traveler: He'll have to be the one that decides what to do.
Traveler: No wonder we haven't seen you all day.
Traveler: Why me?
