Traveler: You like using Claymores?
Iradj: Ahaha... I'm not that skilled. I only dabble with scimitars.
Iradj: Anyway, it's not for me. I was hoping to find a handy weapon for Flame-Mane, a fellow Eremite.
Iradj: She wields greatswords the best among us. Seeing her in action is always a glorious sight to behold...
Iradj: If I can find the best greatsword in all of Sumeru, then I must get it for her! I only hope she won't refuse it when I do...

Traveler: Why don't you go ask the blacksmith?
Iradj: The blacksmith, huh... I'd better not.
Iradj: The boss there is my adoptive father. He's always talking about wanting us to come back and take over the family business.
Iradj: He's been a great father to us, so we always feel bad whenever we have to turn him down...
Iradj: So, it's best that I don't bother him with this sword matter.
