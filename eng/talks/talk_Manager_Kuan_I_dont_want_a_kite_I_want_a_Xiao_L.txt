Yiran: Manager Kuan! I don't want a kite, I want a Xiao Lantern!
Manager Kuan: How many times do I have to tell you, just call me "Daddy."
Manager Kuan: If you want a Xiao Lantern, then we can just release one together. Now, if you want to write a wish on the lantern, just tell me and I'll...
Yiran: No way! Your handwriting is terrible, Manager Kuan. If you write it, our wish will never come true!
Manager Kuan: Ah, child, how could you ever be so cold to your Daddy...
Yiran: But aren't you the one who taught me to always be honest about what's on my mind?
Yiran: And since I know that your handwriting is absolutely terrible, wouldn't I be disobeying if I told you it's fine for you to write?
Manager Kuan: *sigh* Fine, you're right... I'll buy you a lantern... But from now on, you must call me "Daddy."
Yiran: Alright, "Daddy"! Now, Daddy! Do as you promised!
