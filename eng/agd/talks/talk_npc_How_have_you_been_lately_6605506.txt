Traveler: How have you been lately?
Amina: Quite well. Thanks for asking. Thanks to everyone's hard work, this place is as busy as ever, hehe!
Amina: Many people left us when all was said and done... I just hope they all went to the same place as Auntie Atea. The more the merrier, after all!
Amina: ...Sorry, that probably sounds a bit naive. But I really believe that we, the people of Natlan, will be reunited in the Night Kingdom after our passing.
Amina: That's how Ancient Names are forged from the memories of heroes and passed down through the ages.
