# A Gifted Rose: Long Day Ahead


## Talk 1

Affan: Come, come, look at these seeds.
Traveler: Doesn't look like there's been any change.
Affan: I've been growing crops for years, but growing flowers must be different.
Affan: Why else haven't they grown after so long?
Paimon: Let Paimon see, hmm...
Paimon: Grandpa Affan, Paimon thinks your nursery is too dry. And there might not be enough nutrients in the soil around Aaru Village.
Paimon: We've helped a villager grow flowers before, so we have experience.
Affan: Huh. Is that so...
Affan: That makes sense. Such rare flowers should be more delicate than normal ones. Indeed, I don't water and fertilize them enough.
Affan: But this nursery is a little far from any water sources. It's not easy to bring water here.
Affan: And I don't store much water for daily use either, so it is rather inconvenient to water the seeds in the nursery often.
Traveler: I can help.
Affan: Alright, in that case, please water these three seeds first.

## Talk 2

Affan: Good, good, you two are very resourceful.
Affan: I have a feeling that they will grow well this time, now that I have guidance from the experts.
Affan: Were the Shawarma and Tahchin good?
Traveler: They were delicious.
Affan: Delicious, eh? I'll make more for you, then.
Affan: I'm not as good of a cook as my late wife, so forgive my poor cooking. Please take them. The portions are smaller this time, though.
Paimon: This is so tasty! You're really kind! We'll visit you often.
Affan: Haha, didn't you children want to ask me what kind of flower this is?
Affan: I guess I might as well tell you. I'm planting roses.
Traveler: As in, Sumeru Roses?
Affan: This type of flower is called the Golden Rose. It's much more precious than the Sumeru Rose.
Affan: Remember how I told you that these flower seeds were left to me by a friend?
Affan: Well, these seeds, and this old house I'm living in now were all left to me by that late "old ghost."
Affan: Oh, I forgot. You're not from Aaru Village, so you're most likely not familiar with that name.
Affan: No matter. Just think of that fellow as an old man who used to grow some flowers...
Affan: ...
Paimon: Hey, Grandpa Affan, you're spacing out all of a sudden. Hello! Hello?
Affan: Ah! Oh. I was lost in thought. I'm sorry, I'm old, and my mind has begun to wander. How embarrassing...
Affan: Thank you again, children. You can have a look around if there's anything else you want to see.
Affan: I won't drive people away anymore. But be careful not to tread on the nursery.
Traveler: I haven't tried them yet.

## Talk 3

Affan: Water these three seeds first, and I'll think about what to do about the fertilizer.
Affan: After growing things for decades, I do know how to make some simple fertilizer.

## Talk 4

Affan: ♪Rose, oh rose, grant me my wish...
Affan: Hmm? You're still here?
Traveler: Why live here?
Affan: Well, anyway, I'm an old weirdo, and "old weirdos behave in inexplicable ways." Few people ask me questions like you do.
Affan: I've always wanted to go out and grab the chance to do something with my life.
Affan: When I was a newlywed, I almost left with the Eremites, but then I thought about it, and I couldn't just leave my wife to take up a life of wandering.
Affan: Later, I met a traveling merchant and wanted to follow suit and do some business, but that didn't work out because I didn't have enough Mora.
Affan: Much later, my wife passed and nothing held me back anymore, but by then, I'd gotten too old to leave.
Affan: I've dragged things out up till now and I've missed out on too much.
Affan: In retrospect, I've found that I belong neither to this village, nor to anywhere else.
Affan: So in the end, I moved by myself to the edge of the village, and I found life here to be more comfortable.
Affan: And decades went by, just like that.
Affan: I'd like to invite you to come and see these flowers when they bloom. It's probably going to be tomorrow or the day after. Will you be able to make it?
Traveler: Sure.
Affan: Alright, alright...
Affan: ♪Rose, oh rose, grant me my wish...
Traveler: About the old ghost...
Affan: Only outsiders ask about the old ghost. The children of the village all know his name.
Affan: Whenever a child is naughty, their parents will say, "The old ghost will come take you away."
Affan: These younglings don't know the old ghost at all, but are pretty good at using his name to scare people.
Affan: I met the old ghost myself as a child. He did dislike children, but he wasn't scary.
Affan: For some reason, he became known as the old ghost. I thought it was just a bunch of people talking about him behind his back.
Traveler: Weren't you friends?
Affan: When I was young, I used to sneak close to his garden to play. He'd chase me away with a garden hoe as soon as he saw me.
Affan: He probably took me for a naughty child looking to cause trouble. Why would he remember me?
Affan: He might not have known who I was, but I still remember him and his little garden.
Affan: So I suppose I can call him my friend, right?
Affan: I want to grow the same flowers, just to recreate that little garden in my memories.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Affan: Ah, I haven't had time to cook yet, so I'm afraid I have nothing with which to receive you as guests.
Traveler: No need.
Affan: So, this other kid is your friend, huh? She's pretty cute.
Affan: Do you want to come see the flowers when they bloom?
Traveler: No problem.
Affan: They will most likely bloom in a few days. Come back later to see the flowers you helped to plant.
Traveler: Okay.
Affan: Alright, I understand.
Affan: ♪...
Traveler: Don't worry, I'm not hungry.
