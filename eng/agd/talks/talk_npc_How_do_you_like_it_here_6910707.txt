# Talk Dialog

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Citlali: Oh, it's nice.
Citlali: But, I don't think I could actually live here.
Citlali: This space is too big. If I'm reading on the bed and want a drink, I'd have to actually get up and walk...
Traveler: Oh, uh... That's a good point...
Citlali: I know.
Citlali: Wait, did you just agree with me because you think I'm old? Laziness is a habit I learned from young people, you know!
Citlali: Wait, scratch that. I AM young...
Traveler: You could just put a chair next to the bed to hold your snacks and drinks...
Citlali: Genius!
Citlali: Ahem, I mean... you know this place best, so it only makes sense that you would come up with a solution.
Citlali: In that case, I'm in favor of more space. Spacious rooms are more conducive to relaxation, anyway.
