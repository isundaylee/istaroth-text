# Through the Motions, to the Heart


## Talk 1

Paimon: Do you think his "friends" are the Fatui?
Paimon: Things will get sticky if the Fatui happen to recognize you. What should we do?

## Talk 2

Paimon: Good thing you're with us, they don't dare to question you...
Schubert: Of course, that is the benefit of prestige. In past times, it would be a dire offense to speak to a nobleman in such a manner.
Schubert: We could determine a person's fate with the blink of an eye.
Schubert: Hmph, and such glory will return to me again before long.

## Talk 3

Paimon: They're running off in different directions!
Paimon: Paimon remembers that this place is a dead end. Let's take care of the Fatui first and then deal with Schubert later.

## Talk 4

Paimon: The door is open, let's go!

## Talk 5

Paimon: There it is! That's where they've put the diagram!

## Talk 6

Sergei: So you've tracked us here, huh? I guess there's no other option but to fight.

## Talk 7

Boris: Don't wander about if you don't have business being here.

## Talk 8

Daler: Go on in.

## Talk 9

Ivan: Who are you?
Ivan: Just because someone brought you here, don't think you can wander around.

## Talk 10

Paimon: As expected, it's the Fatui!
Schubert: As expected?
Paimon: Uh... b—because we always see them around the city. Um... they must be... very powerful!
Schubert: Hmph, nothing more than foreign ruffians with power and the ability to flaunt it... But they are favorable business partners.

## Talk 11

Schubert: As you'll see in a moment, there are many already helping us.
Schubert: I heard that this area had already been purged once by the Knights of Favonius, but it's the only place around Mondstadt that is well concealed and spacious enough.
Schubert: Although it has fallen into disrepair and does not suit the tastes of the nobility, we simply have to make do for now.
Paimon: Uh, s—sorry, um... can we walk any faster?
Schubert: Of course not. An aristocrat always moves with grace in his steps, moving hurriedly is unacceptable.

## Talk 12

Pyotr: Our preparations have been thorough...
Pyotr: ...But I still can't shake this uneasy feeling.
