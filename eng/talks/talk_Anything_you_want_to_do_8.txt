# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: If the opportunity arises, I would like to take you diving with me.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The world is full of troubles. But when compared with the vastness of the sea, all those troubles seem to just fade away.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Though the ages pass and time brings change, the sea continues as it always has. As I float down among the depths of the sea, a deep tranquility permeates my heart.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: There are times when I feel utterly exhausted, so I thought I should share with you the way that I unwind.
Traveler: But how would I breathe underwater?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm... That is indeed a problem.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Wait, I've come up with a clever solution.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I'll wrap the two of us in a gigantic bubble... We can slowly sink down into the sea together.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: This way, we can journey together underwater! You'll feel refreshed before you know it.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Though I've never gone diving together with anyone before, I must say that I certainly look forward to it.
Traveler: Is there anything that I should prepare beforehand?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: No, not at all. The purpose of the trip is to relax, after all. Simply do as you please.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Besides, you will have the "grand strategist" accompanying you.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: You need only focus on resting and I'll take care of the details.
Traveler: I wouldn't call myself the best swimmer...
