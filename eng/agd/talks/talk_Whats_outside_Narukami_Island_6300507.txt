Traveler: What's outside Narukami Island?
Furuya Noboru: Outside of Narukami Island, if you keep going southwest, you will find Kannazuka, Tatarasuna and Yashiori Island.
Furuya Noboru: These islands have been the focus of recent military conflicts, and I don't recommend that adventurers go there alone. However, many could not resist the temptation of treasure hunting... *cough*
Furuya Noboru: In addition, I haven't heard much good about the Mikage Furnace of Tatarasuna at Kannazuka... Anyway, those who can't handle themselves well had best stay away from these places for now.
Furuya Noboru: After passing through these islands, you will find yourself in the most remote corner of Inazuma, Watatsumi Island, a place under the jurisdiction of the Sangonomiya.
Furuya Noboru: You can find Tsurumi Island to the south of Inazuma. That place has always been shrouded in fog, but that fog has dissipated suddenly for some reason...
Furuya Noboru: The Shogunate has no doubt noticed this as well. I've heard that they're planning to send people to develop that land after an observational period.
Furuya Noboru: Ah, right. While the fog may be gone, the situation is still unclear for now. I would probably still advise any new adventurers to not go there willy-nilly.
