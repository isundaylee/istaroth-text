Traveler: We meet again!
Caholom: So you're the one the prophecies spoke of. Welcome back once again to the Obsidian Altar.
Caholom: Please relax and stretch your legs, just as you would when you travel the world.
Caholom: Our tribesfolk don't often engage proactively with foreigners, so you might earn yourself quite a few curious looks.
Caholom: But please don't worry â€” we might know a few "tricks" that are difficult for foreigners to get, but trust me, we do not have any line-of-sight hexes or things like that.
