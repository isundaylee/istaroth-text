Traveler: How have things been going lately?
Uncle Tian: Well, after handing my work off to others, I must say that I've certainly freed up a lot of time.
Uncle Tian: And now that I've had time to handle more mundane matters, I've realized that many of my old fishing buddies have either passed, or that we've drifted apart in the intervening years.
Uncle Tian: ...Seems like you've got a lot on your mind, too. So how about it, wanna reel a few fish in together?
Uncle Tian: You've got to get away from the clutter if you want to keep your mind clear. In many things, you just have to go with the flow. As long as your conscience is clear, things will be fine.
