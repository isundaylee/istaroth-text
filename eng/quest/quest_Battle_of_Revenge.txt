# Battle of Revenge


## Talk 1

"Kairagi" Leader: You? Hah, aren't you that brat from before? What, are you here to add something to my collection again?
Asakura: No. I am here for my weapon!
"Kairagi" Leader: Heh, well, at least you've got some guts. But only one ally, really? You must really take me for a sucker, huh?
"Kairagi" Leader: But you know what? I'll give you a chance on account of your bravery, at least. Come on! Let's settle this somewhere else.
"Kairagi" Leader: Still... it wouldn't be good to leave my boys here with nothing to do, would it? I know! Why don't you ask your little helper to play with them a bit?
Traveler: Any time they're ready.
"Kairagi" Leader: Hahaha. You've got some lip! Well then, boys, you heard 'em. Let 'em have it!
"Kairagi" Leader: As for you, let's go over there.
Asakura: I leave this in your hands...
Traveler: I'll take care of it.
Asakura: You have my utmost thanks. I will slay him quickly and come to your aid.
"Kairagi" Leader: Well, aren't you a talker yourself? You're welcome to try!
Traveler: Let's hope that their A-game is passable, at least.

## Talk 2

Asakura: From your steady breathing, it seems that those Kairagi were no match for you.
Traveler: And it seems that you were victorious as well.
Asakura: That is indeed the case. Though I must admit that to my shame, I allowed him to escape with but a single stab from my spear due to a feint on his part.
Asakura: Still, his wound was very severe. I do not believe that he will emerge to do much ill for at least a few years.
Asakura: More importantly, I have defeated him myself and reclaimed my weapon. I am henceforth free from the stain of that humiliation.
Traveler: Congratulations, Asakura.
Asakura: Indeed, I owe you thanks, but I cannot rest yet.
Asakura: The reason for this whole incident was my lack of training. I will continue to train hard and refine my skills.
Asakura: As such... I shall be counting on you in the future as well to spar with me!
Asakura: Ah, yes. Please take these as a token of my thanks. It isn't much, but do accept it.
Asakura: Thank you once again!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

"Kairagi": Agh! P—Please, spare me! Where did you get this kind of help...
Asakura: Foul villain! Hand my weapon over at once!
"Kairagi": You... You're still all hung up about that...
Asakura: I am only here to retrieve my weapon. If you tell me where it is, I'll spare you.
"Kairagi": This...
Traveler: Don't waste any more words with him.
"Kairagi": N—No, please! Please stop! I—I didn't say I wouldn't say anything! We don't have to get this violent!
"Kairagi": Th—That weapon was taken by our boss as part of his collection. If you want it, you can just go to the camp over there to get it from him!
Asakura: Well, at least you have some sense.
"Kairagi": P—Please, good sirs, I've told you...
Traveler: Out of my sight!
"Kairagi": At once!
Asakura: Not much martial skill to speak of, but he was quite the runner.
Traveler: Not to mention pretty quick to sell his buddies out, too.
Asakura: The Kairagi are ultimately a motley band who've banded together for their own selfish gain. Loyalty plays no part here, nor does conviction.
Asakura: The moment trouble starts brewing on the horizon, they will pack up and leave. This is all too common.
Asakura: But fortunately, I had you here to help me. I doubt that they would have capitulated so easily otherwise.
Asakura: However, our next stop is their main encampment.
Asakura: We will follow our original stratagem. I will take their leader on, and leave the small fry to you.
Traveler: I'll take care of it.
Asakura: Much obliged!
Traveler: I can take ten of them at once, no problem!
Traveler: Come on, let's find someone else...
