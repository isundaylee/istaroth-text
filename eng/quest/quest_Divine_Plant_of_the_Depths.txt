# Divine Plant of the Depths


## Talk 1

Komaki: Hello there, youngster. From how you dress, you must be from outside the island, yes?
Traveler: That's correct.
Komaki: Ah, then you must be some manner of traveler, then? Well... Would you like to stop here for awhile and divine your way forward?
Paimon: Eh, divining?
Traveler: The way forward...?
Komaki: Hahaha, no, no, there's no need to be so worried. I apologize, it was a bit sudden of me...
Komaki: What I mean to say is, the shrine to Watatsumi here in Bourou Village is most efficacious, which is why I offered you a divination.
Komaki: I did not mean to imply that the road ahead would be perilous.
Komaki: I mean, how can our paths be encompassed by a mere few words? That is quite preposterous, of course.
Paimon: Oh, so it's just fortune-telling, huh? Well, that's a relief!
Traveler: How much will it cost?
Komaki: Oh, it costs nothing. We do not ask for money over such things...
Komaki: If those who man the shrines were to collect money over such a thing as "wishes," we will surely disturb Omikami's great spirit.
Komaki: We are all mortals, after all. How could we dare to profit off the wishes of others?
Paimon: Oh, so that's how it is.
Komaki: So then, would you two be interested in a little fortune-telling?
Traveler: Well, we'll give it a go.
Komaki: Haha, you have my thanks.
Komaki: In this time, there is little peace to be found anywhere, and the young people of the village are busying themselves elsewhere. Seeing you youngsters come here does warm the cockles of this old heart.
Komaki: That you are outlanders who treat the traditions of Watatsumi Island with respect is rarer still. Impressive indeed, haha...
Komaki: Alright, I shan't nag. Now, as for the fortune-telling...
Komaki: Before we begin, would the two of you mind helping this old lady with something?
Paimon: Uh, is this about Mora after all?
Komaki: Hehe, no, no... Come, just listen to me.
Komaki: The efficacy of the shrine here in Bourou Village is derived from the "Deep Sea Spiritherb" grown there.
Komaki: As the name might indicate, this plant once grew at the bottom of the ocean... which is where our ancestors came from.
Komaki: Thousands of years ago, the progenitors of our village transplanted those herbs from the deep sea onto land and raised them very carefully.
Komaki: Under the care of generation after generation of our village's people, neither wars nor natural disasters, or even the great sorrow of our Omikami's martyrdom, have managed to destroy these long-lived Spiritherbs.
Komaki: This plant grows beneath the waters, so it needs a frequent supply of water to survive.
Komaki: And it also gives off a gentle, constant light, owing to having lived in utter darkness.
Komaki: As such, we use the brilliance of its light to judge if the wishes made can be realized, and the heart of this mystery is the water source.
Komaki: Hehe, the younger shrine maidens often doubt the trustworthiness of the divining ritual. They feel that it is insufficiently official, or tantamount to spreading superstition... and other things like that.
Komaki: They prefer theories that are clearer and easy to understand, and lack fondness for word-of-mouth legends that tend to decay over time.
Komaki: Still... the wisdom of the ancients, the knowledge that was passed down from one generation to the next...
Komaki: While it may not be easily unified into some clear theory or another, it does still contain certain truths that cannot be ignored.
Traveler: So, you were talking about the water source...
Komaki: Water source...? Oh! Hehe, right! Ah, just listen to me prattle on. My age really is catching up with me, isn't it?
Komaki: Now then, water from the Offering Pool on this island's shrine is required to raise Spiritherbs. This is because the water there contains "wishes."
Paimon: ...Can water really contain something like that?
Komaki: Hehe, of course. Everyone's "wishes" will accumulate within that pool and dissolve into the water, just like honey.
Komaki: No one can see it, no, but they can tell by the sweetness and viscosity of the water.
Komaki: So it is with memory, and so it is with faith... They all follow this principle.
Komaki: Ah, yes. If you go to draw water, do be careful... The power of these wishes will soon dissipate into the air once you leave the Offering Pool...
Komaki: Just like dreams flow away as the years pass...
Komaki: The dissipation of these wishes, too, can be detected by their touch and weight.
Paimon: Wow...
Traveler: Huh...
Komaki: Haha, sorry, sorry, I seem to have gone off topic again...
Komaki: Either way, return here immediately and do not tarry once you have drawn the water.
Komaki: Otherwise, the power of those wishes will fully dissipate, and the Spiritherbs will not receive proper nutrition...
Komaki: Once this is done, do remind me once again... There is another step required to nourish the Spiritherb and ensure the efficacy of our divination.
Paimon: This is pretty troublesome. Don't you have any shrine maidens to help you out, Granny?
Komaki: *sigh* The young shrine maidens nowadays consider such things bothersome. They turn their noses up at these ancient traditions and generally refuse to help.
Komaki: It is simply depressing beyond measure to watch as the Spiritherbs' glow grows dimmer with each passing day...
Paimon: But y'know, it is kinda troublesome...
Traveler: I kind of understand the shrine maidens' perspective now...
Komaki: Well then. Will you help me draw some water or not?
Traveler: Oh, we'll help alright.
Komaki: In that case, you have my thanks.
Traveler: Is there danger up ahead?
Traveler: How do you do, Granny?

## Talk 2

Komaki: You're back.
Traveler: We've brought what you asked for.
Paimon: Clean water, fresh outta the Offering Pool!
Komaki: Ah, thank you both so much. Come now, allow me to give this water to the Spiritherbs.
Komaki: And yes, where was I... Ah, right. There is another step to make the Spiritherbs more radiant still.
Komaki: The stem and leaves of the Spiritherb will only be truly at home, and thus display the vibrant of color of "wishes," when it is in an environment rich with Hydro from the deep sea.
Komaki: Simply put... There is a cavern to the north where the Hydro composition of the water is closest to the natural environment of this plant.
Komaki: The concentration also differs from place to place within this cavern. Of them, the Hydro concentration you are looking for is something crystal-clear and transparent.
Komaki: But things might get difficult if the water grows turbid, or if you are interrupted by other life forms...
Komaki: *sigh* At my age, I cannot quite be sure of the meaning of these words.
Komaki: Nonetheless, I trust that you will understand it when you see it.
Komaki: That cavern is tightly bound to the secret of our ancestors. Unfortunately, with the recent war, few young people have gone there to draw water and nourish the Spiritherbs.
Komaki: *sigh* Speaking of our young people, I can only hope that they will return safely...
Komaki: Ah yes. If you want to go there to draw water, youngster, please be very careful.
Paimon: Don't worry, Granny, we'll be fine!
Traveler: I'll take note.
Komaki: Good, good. Thank you both very much.
Traveler: Please be at ease.

## Talk 3

Komaki: Ah, you've returned. Come, come, have a rest.
Paimon: Granny Komaki, we've brought the water you asked for!
Traveler: This is the "ideal water" you spoke of, yes?
Komaki: Yes, and this amount will do the job as well. Thank you for the trouble...
Komaki: Haha, ah, look at them...
Komaki: From the Spiritherbs' radiance... The year to come will surely be a peaceful and abundant one.
Paimon: Hmm, how could you tell?
Komaki: The color of the Spiritherbs has always been dependent on the moisture it gets, and the nourishment it gains from the wishes of the people.
Komaki: This soul-light is the embodiment of those wishes â€” the better the wishes, the more vibrant the light, and the more hope there is in our future.
Komaki: After all, everyone wishes for a better tomorrow, don't they?
Komaki: As long everyone wishes to do something to improve on their present lives a little...
Komaki: Even something as terrible as a war's aftermath may yet prove to be a small affair in comparison.
Paimon: Uh... So does this have anything to do with its... efficacy?
Komaki: Of course. This is the wisdom of us old folks, after all.
Komaki: Wishes drive and encourage people, and the results of their actions verify their wishes in turn.
Komaki: As long as we are able to protect our peaceful lives, and as long as we can hold on to hope even during dark days...
Komaki: The divinations of the Spiritherb will always be efficacious.
Traveler: This feels like a perfunctory explanation for a superstition...
Komaki: Hehe. Ah, youngster, you will understand someday.
Komaki: Ah, by the way, the power of the wishes within the water will last a few days more. If you are willing, you can come by again anytime for another divination.
Traveler: But it isn't entirely without merit...

Traveler: Are you talking about Tsuyuko by any chance?
Paimon: Oh right, there's that shrine maiden by the Sangonomiya Shrine who really looks down old folks.
Komaki: Ah, you've met her, then?
Komaki: Haha, that girl... She's a capable one, alright, but...
Komaki: Ah, I shan't say too much. Suffice it to say that young people will someday learn to respect the meaning behind traditional stories.
Paimon: Uh, what? Paimon doesn't get it.
Komaki: It is simply depressing beyond measure to watch as the Spiritherbs' glow grows dimmer with each passing day...

## Talk 5

Komaki: I wonder how's the divination this year...
