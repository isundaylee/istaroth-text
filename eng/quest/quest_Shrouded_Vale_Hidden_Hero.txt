# Shrouded Vale, Hidden Hero


## Talk 1

Paimon: Yay! We've managed to lower the water level. Let's go see what's inside!

## Talk 2

Engraved Inscription: "...The heavens are unfaithful, and those who seek its blessing and gain audience are rare. Fate is capricious, and those whose prosperity endures are few... They who are favored often find their paths barred, and worse awaits those who are not..."
Engraved Inscription: "...This monument was left to ask this of future generations. When you have reached a dead end, what shall you do?"
Traveler: (Touch the stone tablet.)
Traveler: (Leave.)

## Talk 3

Paimon: Huh? This sword seems to have something written on it. Let Paimon see...
Ancient Swordsman's Inscriptions: "...Caressing the blade, singing I go, to cleave dragons and drink their blood. The divine light, like flowing lightning, like a frigid wave, threatens to smash the mountains..."
Ancient Swordsman's Inscriptions: "...Beneath Mt. Tianheng, I slay tigers, the scaled beast I skewer amidst the Sea of Clouds... When I return crowned in success, we shall live at ease..."
Paimon: There's also a stone tablet next to it... Eh? The handwriting below seems to be different...
Ancient Engraving: "...I originally wanted to leave behind some delicacies here. But the food would inevitably spoil over time, so I left the recipes here for you to cook instead. I assure you, they shall be delicious indeed."
Ancient Engraving: "...Apart from these, nothing else remains. Only this sword and the beautiful scenery."
Ancient Engraving: "...When faced with a dead end, what should we do? You already know the answer."
Crooked Engraving: "...Do not take... treasure, leaving solely one... henceforth..."
Crooked Engraving: May my final stand... be a monument...
Paimon: Whoa... These lines here are so illegible that Paimon can't understand it one bit!
Traveler: They roughly mean that he didn't take anything with him.
Paimon: *sob* After all this, we didn't find a single valuable treasure. All that hope for nothing...
Traveler: You're telling me!
Paimon: Paimon never imagined that we'd be able to still see such scenery in a tight spot like this, though... It's something at least, right?
Traveler: It's okay. I'll make you something to eat.
Paimon: #Huh? For real!? Then it's settled, {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: I don't get them either...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Wen the Fourth: Sigh... To think that after a thousand years of heritage, the Guhua Clan's head doorkeeper must cheat others to survive... What shall we do, what can be done...
Huang the Third: Ugh... Alright, come on now. Am I not sparing my junior from starving to death while guarding our gates...?
Huang the Third: #And don't look at me like that. You're always depressed... But you were pleased to see {NICKNAME}'s performance just now, weren't you?
Wen the Fourth: That fool from before? They get to take a look around for making you some rice with bacon? And I would be pleased about that? I would slap you to death if I were a few years younger...
Huang the Third: Heh! Your technique was inferior to mine just a few years ago!
Huang the Third: ...Anyway, listen... Only a few of us geezers are left. What do you plan to do after we stop testing those who may be destined to join us? Take those books with us to our graves?
Wen the Fourth: ...
Huang the Third: Hah... Just forget it. What's the point of saying such depressing things?
Huang the Third: Oh, why don't you try the food those kids made me? Hehe! I think it's better than Wanmin Restaurant's fare! Here, take a bite! Just a bite!
