# Urgent Repairs


## Talk 1

Traveler: In for a penny...
Allan: Wonderful! There should be some in the woods.

## Talk 2

Allan: #Th—Thank you, Traveler, I can't believe my luck... I was sure I was done for...
Allan: This cart is loaded up with everything the hunters managed to catch. Draff had me deliver it to the city.
Allan: I'm... not the best hunter in the world, but a simple delivery is something I should be able to handle. Or so I thought...
Allan: I very nearly messed the whole thing up. This attack was completely out of the blue. I guess they must have been after the goods. It's a good thing you showed up when you did.
Allan: Erm, it's not easy for me to ask, but... My cart was damaged in the attack, and it's my only way out of here.
Allan: I'm sure the woods around here would have the materials I need for any repairs, but I just can't bring myself to leave my goods unattended.
Allan: If it's not too much hassle, would you be able to take a look around and help me find a *Sturdy Plank*?

## Talk 3

Allan: It just needs patching up here and there, just enough so it can make it to Mondstadt.
Allan: There's bound to be some useful timber in the woods around here.

## Talk 4

Allan: That's plenty, in just two seconds I'll have this...
Allan: Ahhh! They're back, Traveler, they're back!

## Talk 5

Allan: You're a life-saver! They are awfully persistent, aren't they? I wonder what those hunters caught that is so irresistible ...
Allan: I have nothing but admiration for Draff, managing to hunt such fine specimens. *sigh* If only I could learn to hunt like him...
Allan: Well, first things first. Better get this old thing into the city.
Allan: Argh, you're not going to believe this... I was almost done repairing the cart, but they did a little bit more damage when they attacked again...
Allan: Things can only get worse the longer I stay here. I need to fix this as soon as possible. There was some rope in the back, but the hilichurls must have nabbed it.
Allan: Traveler — may I trouble you to look around the area and see if you can find some *rope*?

## Talk 6

Allan: There should be some rope in the woods.

## Talk 7

Allan: That should do it. It feels like it could fall apart at any moment, but as long it gets me back to Mondstadt I'll be fine.
Allan: Thanks for everything! I'm good to go now. Get in touch next time you're in Springvale and let's get a drink!
Allan: ...As long as you don't drink like Draff, that is.

## Talk 8

Traveler: Don't worry, I've got this.
Allan: Fantastic! I'll be waiting right here. Please don't be too long though, I feel like they might come back...

## Talk 9

Traveler: Come on, you've got this!
Allan: Please, I'm begging you! They might still be nearby... I need to disappear as soon as possible, and you're the only one who can help make that happen!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Traveler: I have other things to do.
Allan: But... This is the final step, I just need the rope and then I can take things from there! Sorry to trouble you...
