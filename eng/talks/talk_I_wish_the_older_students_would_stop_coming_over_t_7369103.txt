Farbal: I wish the older students would stop coming over to ask. This really, truly is just a toy.
Farbal: Ah? Oh... It's you, Traveler. Would you like to play a round or two of "Gathering of Stars"?
Traveler: I'd like to give this a try.
Farbal: Sure. The astrolabe is over here.
Traveler: I've got other things to do right now, sorry.
Farbal: Well, I'll be here at the booth throughout the Gala. If you're of a mind to play, just hit me up.
