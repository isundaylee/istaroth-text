# Waiting For Seeds to Sprout


## Talk 1

Paimon: #What's up, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}? You were just digging about over there. Did you unearth something amazing?
Paimon: Was it some sort of valuable treasure?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: Hmm, let Paimon see... Is this some sorta seed? Huh. Didn't think we'd find something like that in this barren ground...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rrrawr?
Paimon: That said, this doesn't look all that valuable...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Roar...
Traveler: Seeds contain infinite possibilities...
Paimon: Still, this place must have been abandoned for ages. The soil looks so hard, too... Could this seed really still be alive?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr...?
Paimon: Are you upset? ... Well, sometimes it's hard to say — some seeds just won't sprout naturally...
Paimon: But we could replant it and see what happens. Maybe it just hasn't sprouted yet? Maybe the hole wasn't well dug, or it didn't get enough nutrients.
Paimon: So it might grow if we plant it properly! Hehe, what might grow from it? A giant Grainfruit, maybe? Or... Y'know, a Cacahuatl with a super strong aroma might be awesome too!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: Or maybe a Whopperflower...
Paimon: Hey, come on! Stop being a killjoy!
Paimon: That said, what sort of nutrients do plants from Natlan need? ... Anyway, let's get this planted first!
Traveler: You never know, it might grow into something impressive!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Yeah, this depth should do it!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: Let Paimon think... Hmm, if there was one way in which plants from Natlan might be different... It's gotta be Phlogiston! Maybe we can use that to fuel the seed? Let's give it a go!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Agh, it looks like all the Phlogiston around the seed is gone... Guess we're gonna have to restock, huh?

## Talk 4

Paimon: C'mon out, little seed~
Paimon: C'mon out, little flower~
Paimon: ...Huh?
Traveler: Huh...
Paimon: #Ah, Traveler, the Phlogiston's energy has faded. It must've been absorbed by the seed, but... There was no reaction.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Errh?
Traveler: Perhaps it just needs time to grow.
Paimon: You really think so? You might have a point...
Paimon: Dandelion seeds go flying off like little umbrellas if you just blow lightly on 'em, Wolfhooks attach themselves to little wolves, and run off with them to faraway places...
Paimon: Seeds are tenacious little things!
Paimon: Well, in that case, let's leave it alone for now — there'll be time to come back later!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: Maybe the seed's got stage fright...
Paimon: R—Really? Hmm, yeah, maybe Paimon's just being too impatient...
Paimon: #The seed got dug up by {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}, had its nutrients stolen by flying insects, and was even disturbed by some monsters barging in...
Paimon: That fight must've sounded like a horrible thunderstorm to a seed — guess it's only natural that it would hide in the soil, not daring to move.
