Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "...A gentle reminder from Aclla: When you're making friends with Yumkasaurs, make sure you adjust your approach depending on their age!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Generally speaking, both juvenile and adult Yumkasaurs enjoy having their noses — the part that protrudes above their mouth — gently pressed by their companions. A bit like how friends might give each other a friendly pat on the back."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "If you've got a baby Yumkasaur on your hands, they'll love a gentle ear rub."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Some Yumkasaurs approaching adulthood may be sensitive about people touching their ears. After all, they're no longer little kids anymore — in their own minds, anyway!"
