Traveler: What are you talking about?
Lelienne: You might find this hard to imagine, but many people in this world would love a chance to restart their lives.
Lelienne: But a little change to one's appearance can halve the difficulty â€” and that's my specialty, see?
Lelienne: There's a bright future ahead for this sort of research, and you look like the sort of person with an eye on the future, so, would you consider sponsoring me?
Lelienne: I'm a proper engineer from the Fontaine Research Institute, you know? ... Well, I was, anyway.
