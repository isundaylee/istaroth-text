Traveler: Why are the Fatui in Mondstadt?
Luke: *tut* The Fatui do not simply show up in a place for no reason!
Luke: It's because those Knights of Favonius can't handle the Stormterror issue properly.
Luke: When Mondstadt is on the back foot, we Fatui will make our move... Then, whether it's pretext for stationing troops or gaining diplomatic sway...
Luke: ...Bah, I've said too much! You did this on purpose...
Luke: You heard nothing, and if you did it wasn't from me, you understand?
Traveler: Can the Fatui solve the problem with Stormterror?
Luke: Hah! You dare question the abilities of the Fatui!?
Luke: I've had the honor of seeing the youngest among the Harbingers, Childe, in action once. It was quite a scene, even I...
Luke: Well now look what you've made me say! Ahem, anyway...
Luke: If the Fatui's Harbingers were to get involved, Stormterror wouldn't even stand a chance.
