Traveler: Queen Aranyani's story.
Arakarman: All Aranara are children of Queen Aranyani, even Aramuhukunda.
Arakarman: Queen Aranyani loves all living things in Vana equally, whether they are Aranara, Nara, Mushrooms, or Rishboland Tigers... To Queen Aranyani, all of them are green leaves on the same tree. Whether they are from the crown of the tree, or from the lowest branches, the leaves plucked from the tree all have the same shape.
Arakarman: So all living things returned the same love to Queen Aranyani.
Arakarman: But one day, the sky turned black and the streams became as acrid as blood... Big iron chunks and large ink-black monsters were everywhere. The forest started burning too, and Marana flowed out like spring water.
Arakarman: In order to heal the world, Queen Aranyani went to a place far, far away. However, she did not return. Perhaps she turned into a tree to bear fruit that can heal the world.
Arakarman: Many Aranara only knew what the taste of sadness was like for the first time when that happened.
