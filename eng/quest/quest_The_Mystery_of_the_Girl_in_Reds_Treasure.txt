# The Mystery of the Girl in Red's Treasure


## Talk 1

Klee: We're here! This is the place!
Klee: Look, this is where my huuuge treasure was buried...
Paimon: And where there's now a huuuge empty hole in the ground...
Traveler: Wait — who's that over there?
Paimon: It's... an Abyss Mage!? Hey, maybe he's the one Jean was warning us about.
Paimon: What's that in his hand?
Klee: My treasure!
Paimon: ...Wha!?
Abyss Mage: Hmph! I see the little girl's brought her friends with her! Time for a change of plan...
Paimon: Hey, you! If you think you're so tough, get back here and fight!
Traveler: After him!

## Talk 2

Paimon: A gateway to a domain! The Abyss Mage must have snuck inside.
Traveler: Then he has no way out.
Klee: *panting* ...
Paimon: Klee, do you need a rest?
Paimon: Why don't you wait here while we get your treasure back for you?
Klee: ...No, I'm coming with you!
Klee: It's my treasure that Mr. Fluffball stole, and it's up to me to get it back!
Traveler: I admire your courage.
Klee: Hee-hee, don't worry. Klee is a big girl!
Klee: #Come on, {F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight! Let's goooo!
Traveler: But these domains can be dangerous.
Traveler: Let's keep up the chase.

## Talk 3

Abyss Mage: Hmph. You followed me. I must say, I'm impressed.
Abyss Mage: But this is as far as you will get.
Paimon: Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
Abyss Mage: Mwuhahaha! Ahahahaha!
Abyss Mage: Oh, the human proclivity to gossip has provided us with everything we need...
Abyss Mage: We learned that your little red friend had in her possession the most powerful treasure in all of Mondstadt.
Abyss Mage: That treasure is now in my hands. There is nothing you can do!
Abyss Mage: Now your precious treasure shall be your undoing!
Klee: No, no, wait! D—Don't touch it!
Abyss Mage: Hah! Oh, how you fret now your predicament is finally clear to you!
Abyss Mage: Now, what have we here — a flame symbol? Mwuhahaha...
Abyss Mage: *bang*
Klee: NO!
Klee: I broke the survival rules... "Explosions can hurt people... Jean can be dreadful..."
Klee: This is it... This time I'm done for... *sobs*
Paimon: ...
Paimon: Wait, so Klee's treasure is a bomb!?
Traveler: That was epic...
Paimon: No wonder Klee was rumored to be the strongest fighter in Mondstadt.
Paimon: Paimon for one is never picking a fight with her. Ever.
Paimon: Hold on... Why has she gone and run off?
Traveler: Something to do with the survival rules...
Paimon: Seems like it!
Paimon: Well then, let's head to the *Knights' headquarters* and report to Jean.
Traveler: Something to do with Jean...
Traveler: It made short work of that Abyss Mage!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Game's up. Now hand it over!
Abyss Mage: Grr...
Abyss Mage: You fools think I would give this up so easily after what I have been through to acquire it?
Abyss Mage: Hehe...

## Talk 5

Paimon: Freeze!
Abyss Mage: *panting* That girl's lucky she didn't come alone, otherwise I'd...
Abyss Mage: Hmph...
