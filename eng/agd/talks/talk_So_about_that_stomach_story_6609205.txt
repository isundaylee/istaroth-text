Traveler: So, about that stomach story...
Pacal: Well... It's kind of a long story...
Pacal: Basically, I was also once a dashing young man who dreamed of earning the Wayob's acknowledgment and recognition.
Pacal: And once I realized that an Ancient Name would be forever beyond my reach, food became my main way of coping with stress.
Pacal: But I've made my peace with the matter of Ancient Names. Even if I can't fight, there are still other things that I can do to support everyone.
Pacal: You know what our mantra says: no one fights alone. My determination is just like my weight â€” they are both here to stay.
