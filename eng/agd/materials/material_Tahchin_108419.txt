# Tahchin

A classic staple served in large quantities. Cooked rice is mixed with meat that was marinated in yogurt, then baked until its surface turns crispy. Don't forget to add a handful of Padisarah petals before serving! Both the rice and meat are enough to keep one's stomach full for a long time, making it a very popular dish at the Grand Bazaar.
