Traveler: About the desert...
Darina: I'm sure you can imagine it without my help. An endless expanse of sand, the scorching sun, wind mixed with dirt...
Darina: Not to mention the dangers posed by sandstorms, alongside ruins filled with strange mechanisms.
Darina: Some say that in the past, there weren't any deserts in Sumeru. The desert only appeared due to a battle between King Deshret and the Dendro Archon...
Darina: But every time I bring this up, someone will rebut me, saying that they never fought.
Darina: Not that I really care how the desert was formed, really. I'm more interested in when it'll go away.
Darina: That's when we traveling merchants will be able to do business more safely, you know?
