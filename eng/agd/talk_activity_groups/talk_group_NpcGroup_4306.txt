## Talk

Farbod: I pick Rukkhashava Mushrooms every day. My waist is sore and my back aches...
Farbod: And I'm only in my twenties!

## Talk

Traveler: Sounds tough.
Farbod: Ugh, no kidding. Picking mushrooms requires endless bending down. It gets real horrible after a while.
Farbod: Luckily, the Akademiya requires a huge supply of Rukkhashava Mushrooms, so I gained a steady job from this.
Farbod: My current goal is to save some Mora, buy a house in the city, and live there!

## Talk

Traveler: Take care of yourself.
Farbod: Oh, yeah, you too.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about the city...
Farbod: I've been living in the wilderness all my life, so I rarely get the chance to enter the city. Even my mushrooms are sent into the city via convoy.
Farbod: You seem like you've been to places. Can you tell me what city life is like?
Farbod: I heard city folk merely have to sing songs or dance to get some shiny Mora. Is that true?
Farbod: But isn't every Mora a piece of the Geo Archon's flesh? Why would they trade using an Archon's flesh?
Farbod: And what would they do without Mora?
Farbod: *sigh* It eludes me. Cities truly are mysterious.

Traveler: About Rukkhashava Mushrooms...
Farbod: Rukkhashava Mushrooms are great stuff! You know by the name that they must be something amazing left by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.
Farbod: I think... uh, they can serve as cooking ingredients, herbs... well, and maybe fertilizer?
Farbod: Well, I'm not sure. Since the Akasha didn't tell me all its uses, I guess I didn't need to know.
Farbod: As long as the Akademiya needs it, I can always make money from it.
Farbod: The only thing I do know is that it's a great ingredient for cooking. Here are some for you. Take a try.

Farbod: Rukkhashava Mushrooms are great stuff! You know by the name that they must be something amazing growing only on old trees.
Farbod: I think... uh, they can serve as cooking ingredients, herbs... well, and maybe fertilizer?
Farbod: Well, I'm not sure. All I know is that as long as the Akademiya needs it, I can always make money from it.
