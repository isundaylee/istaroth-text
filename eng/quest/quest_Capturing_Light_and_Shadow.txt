# Capturing Light and Shadow


## Talk 1

Paimon: Voila! All done!
Paimon: Seeing Water Droplets so happy really gives Paimon a sense of achievement!
Traveler: This mural is important to the Water Droplets.
Paimon: Right! Based on their reaction, it seems the Water Droplets really care about the painter. We haven't collected all the diary fragments and read the painter's whole story...
Paimon: If we have some extra time on our hands, we can explore the cave and find the rest of the diary fragments!
Paimon: Speaking of which, the style of this painting is pretty unique... Even though it's not that fancy, it's still beautiful!
Paimon: And what's more important is that Paimon can understand it! Perhaps if Paimon imitates the style, she can also paint lovely yet understandable paintings!
Traveler: Sensational paintings aren't necessarily complicated.
Paimon: Yes! And if it's okay with you, let's take a picture of this painting!
Paimon: Then Paimon can study the painting whenever she likes!
Paimon: Maybe once Paimon has also painted something that pretty, it'll attract lots of Water Droplets that want to be Paimon's friends!
Traveler: Wanna learn how to paint that way, Paimon?
Traveler: There are still many stories about the painter and Water Droplets we don't know.

## Talk 2

Paimon: #Alright, this should be the most critical step. Let's keep it up, {NICKNAME}!
Paimon: As long as we use the power of the Streaming Projectors, we can completely restore the mural!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Voila! All done!
Paimon: Seeing the Water Droplets so happy makes Paimon happy too!
Traveler: We protected the essence of friendship.
Paimon: Now, both the painter's friends and their work in the Veluriyam Mirage are looking their best!
Paimon: Maybe someday, that painter will return to visit their friends and look at their masterpiece!
Paimon: Speaking of which, the style of this painting is pretty unique... Even though it's not that fancy, it's still beautiful!
