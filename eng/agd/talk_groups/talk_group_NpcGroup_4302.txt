Traveler: Did I disturb you?
Nasrin: It's not your fault. It's just an old habit of mine that's acting up.
Nasrin: I'm used to speaking softly because I hunt frequently and sometimes meet researchers training in the forest. It's taking me some time to speak normally again.
Nasrin: Many mistake me for an introvert because of that, and they are really careful when they talk to me.
Nasrin: It isn't necessary at all. Please talk to me normally.

Traveler: About the researchers...
Nasrin: Oh, while there aren't many of them, and they are usually in hidden spots, you'll still meet them if you stay in Avidya Forest all the time.
Nasrin: Honestly, I'm not really sure of the specifics of the principle.
Nasrin: I only know that this situation is called something like... Savada Life? It's a special stage in the training of researchers, during which they can't be disturbed.
Nasrin: So, I sometimes worry that that inexperienced Trainee Forest Ranger will disturb those Akademiya researchers.
Nasrin: Hmm... Still, since she's with the Forest Watchers, I doubt she'll be as reckless as someone who's never read the Rainforest Survival Guide in their lives.
