# Wilting Weeping Willow


## Talk 1

Paimon: This must be where the other key is hidden, right? Things certainly do seem odd around here...
Paimon: Why don't we try and find the altar? The key should be on one, just like before.

## Talk 2

Mysterious Altar: (Most of the inscription has been scratched out, but you can make out "...foam...")

## Talk 3

Paimon: And that's another key for us. Now all we need to do is find the final one.
Pahsiv: Key, key, Pahsiv!
Paimon: Oh, Pahsiv! Where did you come from?
Pahsiv: Disappeared, Pahsiv.
Paimon: Okay then... Paimon's never met a Melusine so unique... And Paimon thought Melusine all lived in the Court of Fontaine or Merusea Village. How come you're out here?
Pahsiv: Court of Fontaine? Merusea Village?
Paimon: You seem confused. Haven't you heard of those places?
Pahsiv: Court of Fontaine, Melusine... Merusea Village, Melusine...
Pahsiv: Ah... Erinnyes, Pahsiv, home.
Pahsiv: Erinnyes, Pahsiv, protect!
Paimon: Wait, you're saying that this is your home? And that you're protecting it?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv!
Traveler: But don't the Melusine live in Merusea Village?
Paimon: Yes, that's kinda strange. Are some Melusine born elsewhere? Paimon can't see any others here though.
Paimon: Pahsiv, do you live here alone?
Pahsiv: Alone? Melusine. That visitor! Pahsiv!
Paimon: That... visitor? There's a visitor? Who?
Pahsiv: #That... visitor! Paimon, Paimon, Traveler, Traveler. That visitor, that visitor!
Traveler: So who is that visitor, exactly?
Paimon: Pahsiv... are you trying to say that visitor is called that visitor, like Paimon is called Paimon?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv!
Paimon: Ah-ha! I was right. Paimon's always said that she's clever, hasn't she?
Traveler: It's a very strange name.
Pahsiv: That visitor, Pahsiv, knowledge, ka-pow.
Paimon: Err... you mean that the visitor is helping you learn things?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv! Lots of. Language, wisdom... lots of.
Paimon: Er, Paimon's not sure about the "lots of" bit...
Pahsiv: Pahsiv, that visitor, protect, ka-pow.
Paimon: And he helps you protect this place?
Pahsiv: Melusine...
Traveler: You help him protect this place?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv!
Paimon: So that's it... But who is this visitor? And why does he need you to help protect this place, anyway?
Paimon: And some really bad things have happened here, too. We saw the stone tablet and how someone had scratched out the inscription, and lots of filth... Are there any enemies?
Pahsiv: Curious Paimon, Pahsiv! But time very not lots of.
Pahsiv: Key, key, key, square, west, ka-pow, ka-pow.
Traveler: We'll be as quick as we can!
Pahsiv: #Paimon, Pahsiv! Traveler, Pahsiv!
Black Screen Text: Pahsiv gives two happy jumps and then leaves in a bit of a hurry.
Paimon: It looks like we really are pressed for time. But we've already got two keys, so let's press on and get the third!
Traveler: That's an awesome name.

## Talk 4

Mysterious Altar: (Most of the inscription has been scratched out, but you can make out "...foam...")
Paimon: What does that mean? It must be crucial to finding the key, right? Guess we need to figure out how to activate this altar...
