# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Are you a matra?
Shohre: Oh? So you don't exactly know what I do, huh?
Shohre: No worries. As a matter of fact, that's a good thing. The fewer people who come to talk to me about work, the better — that means our academic environment is a healthy one.
Shohre: A life surrounded by books... That does sound rather nice. I'd say that there's no simpler form of life than one where your only goal is to study.
Shohre: Even I sometimes want to borrow a book or two when I look at the tidy shelves in the House of Daena.
Shohre: But that's just a thought. I know myself — I'm far too impatient to read.
