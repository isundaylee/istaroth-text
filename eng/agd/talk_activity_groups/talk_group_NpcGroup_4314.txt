Traveler: Hello.
Asfand: Greetings. This is the Citadel of Regzar, headquarters of the Corps of Thirty, the Eremites that guard Sumeru City.
Asfand: I have retired, but I have been asked by Rukh Shah to be an advisor because I have served in both the Corps of Thirty and other groups.
Asfand: If there are any unexpected conflicts, you can call on me to resolve them.

Traveler: Nice to meet you again.
Asfand: Greetings. At my age, it's really nice to see familiar faces again.
Asfand: Rukh Shah and I were talking about how well Dehya carried out the commission this time. Not only did she get to know the young lady of the Homayanis, she also managed to make some new friends.
Asfand: Dehya is a reliable partner and one of the best in the Corps of Thirty. She does speak too frankly sometimes, please forgive her if she's offended you.
Asfand: For people like the Eremites who always have to be on the move and travel far away, it's always a good thing to have more partners on the journey.
