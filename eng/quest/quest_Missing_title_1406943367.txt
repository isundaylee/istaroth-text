# Missing title (1406943367)


## Talk 1

Claims to be "Tang Wuchou": What, did you get stumped by Old Chou's games again?
Claims to be "Tang Wuchou": C'mon, I told you already... That treasure hunt of his works like this: the *better the goods, the more explosive barrels there will be around it, and vice versa.*
Claims to be "Tang Wuchou": Got it this time?

## Talk 2

Uncle He: You Treasure Hoarder dreg... *pants* If I wasn't so exhausted from lacking any... mushrooms to eat lately...
Uncle He: I would have beaten you black and blue already!
Claims to be "Tang Wuchou": You old thief! How dare you call my Glaze L... I mean, Qingxin! How dare you call them mushrooms and just... pick and eat them!
Claims to be "Tang Wuchou": *cough* By what right do you get to do that?
Paimon: Uh, why are you two fighting?
Uncle He: I—I was looking for mushroom-meat! Haha, yes, mushroom-meat! But they wouldn't let me back into the mines, no! So I—I came here looking for some.
Uncle He: And after searching and searching, I finally found that there were mushrooms here! But just as I was reaching for them, this cad attacked me out of nowhere!
Claims to be "Tang Wuchou": #Hah! A cad? He's the one who violated our Guhua training grounds! And what's more, these flowers belong to me... and the heroic Traveler...
Paimon: And the heroic Paimon!
Claims to be "Tang Wuchou": Yes, and the heroic Paimon! Other than the three of us, none may touch these sacred grounds!
Uncle He: Treasure Hoarder dreg!
Claims to be "Tang Wuchou": Scandalous old crook!
Paimon: Okay, okay, Uncle He, Tang Wuchou has stopped being a Treasure Hoarder already. Also, the stuff he planted are flowers, not mushrooms.
Uncle He: Eh? Is that so?
Paimon: C'mon, have a closer look. These are Qingxin for sure!
Uncle He: Ah! Indeed, they are Qingxin! It appears that I'm still a little dizzy...
Paimon: And you, Tang Wuchou, are you seriously still dreaming of growing that "great Glaze Lily garden" of yours?
Claims to be "Tang Wuchou": Well, it would be a most beautiful sight to see, wouldn't you say?
Paimon: Whatever the problem is, stop fighting!
Uncle He: *sigh* No mushrooms. Goodbye, I go.
Claims to be "Tang Wuchou": Now that that troublesome old geezer is gone, I can finally look into planting some flowers...
