Traveler: Long time no see, Mister.
Sanden: Wow, it really has been a while. Did you have fun with Miss Kamisato at the festival last time?
Sanden: Haha, it wasn't as lively because it was getting a little too late, but it's good that you guys had fun.
Sanden: If you two come to the festival again, it'd make me really happy if you could wear the masks that I made!
