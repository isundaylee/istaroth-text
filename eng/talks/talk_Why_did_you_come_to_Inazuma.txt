Traveler: Why did you come to Inazuma?
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": Hmm, I heard that the locals excel in swordsmanship, and I wanted to see it for myself.
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": I'm not boasting. I've already defeated half of the fighters in Liyue with my unique technique, Rumbling Hand. No one's been a match for me yet!
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": I have not only won the title of Crux Clash Champion, but also clocked the teeth off some of those so-called ace fighters who possess Visions...
Master Qin "Thunder Hand": Going undefeated all these years is just too boring! Hmph, so I just want to see the world, challenge fighters everywhere, and learn about foreign cultures.
