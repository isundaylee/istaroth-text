Traveler: So, what's the White Lift, exactly?
Kazim: This elevator was built with the help of a Village Keeper a long time ago.
Kazim: You know of Village Keepers, yes? Those are the mad researchers exiled here by the Akademiya.
Kazim: They're a little batty most of the time, but sometimes, they'll pull themselves together and help us out.
Kazim: Anyway, back to the White Lift. The Village Keeper who helped build it is said to have been a Kshahrewar researcher. In fact, some people wanted to name the machine the Kshahrewar Lift at first.
Kazim: But I'm sure you know how things have always been a bit testy between Aaru Village and the Akademiya. I doubt that name would have gone down well with everyone.
Kazim: So in the end, we just named it after the color that represents Kshahrewar â€” and that's how it became known as the White Lift.
