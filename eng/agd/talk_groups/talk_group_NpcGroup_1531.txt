Adelinde: Ah, you're back.
Adelinde: How are things at Falcon Coast?
Paimon: Hmm, it's kinda hard to explain.
Traveler: It's too early to say for sure.
Adelinde: Fair enough. Well, I don't know the first thing about combat situations anyway, so you can spare yourselves the ordeal of trying to explain it all to me.
Adelinde: If there's anything you need, let me know, and I'll sort it out.
Adelinde: I'll be right here when you need me.
Traveler: We need to keep monitoring the situation for a while.

## Talk 1

Traveler: Is that how it is...
Adelinde: Haha, you're overthinking things, that's just nonsense.
Adelinde: ...Ah, yes. How's your appetite been recently?
Adelinde: I made some extra steaks today. If you're not picky, please take them.
Adelinde: Like I said, don't overthink it. These are perfectly normal animal steaks. There's nothing wrong with them at all... *chuckles*

Traveler: Master Kaeya?
Adelinde: Looks like he's doing pretty well recently. Though he laughed all the way through dinner with Master Diluc, I could see that he was worried...
Adelinde: If you're asking about the title, that's all in the past...
Adelinde: Sorry, that was a slip of the tongue... Please forget I ever said that.

Traveler: Who are you?
Adelinde: I am the head housemaid. Please come to me if you ever need help with anything at the winery.
Adelinde: My work? Just housekeeping. Most of the time it's just cleaning the rooms and taking out the trash, nothing strenuous.
Traveler: What can you tell me about the rumors?
Adelinde: Was it Moco and Hillie you heard that from? *sigh* It sounds like they've been telling tall tales to the guests again...
Adelinde: Don't take them too seriously. Nothing they tell you is worth paying too much attention to.
Adelinde: Did you really think there could be quite so much drama... Heh...
