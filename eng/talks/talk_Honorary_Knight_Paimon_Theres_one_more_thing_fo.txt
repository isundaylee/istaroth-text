Bernhard: Honorary Knight. Paimon. There's one more thing for you to decide.
Paimon: Alright, alright. We'll help. What do you need?
Bernhard: The peak time of Weinlesefest will soon be over. Some shopkeepers estimate that they will have some surplus in stock and plan to donate to us.
Paimon: Isn't that a good thing? "Surplus stock" sounds like a bad thing, but they seem to mean well.
Traveler: We might not be able to sell it all.
Bernhard: The Honorary Knight has a good point. Our ability to sell is also limited.
Bernhard: After these goods are donated to us, we might not be able to sell them, and they might accumulate.
Bernhard: Some of the daily necessities and food would soon go bad, which would be a waste of good intentions.
Paimon: #Hmm! Paimon didn't think about that. {NICKNAME} always seems to know best!
