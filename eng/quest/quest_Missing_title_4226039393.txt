# Missing title (4226039393)


## Talk 1

Bulletin Board: This Commercial Street bulletin board was set up by the Shogunate. Notices of all kinds will be posted here. Do not post without authorization.

## Talk 2

Bulletin Board: A number of suspicious outlanders have entered Inazuma lately, wandering around with seemingly sinister motives.
Bulletin Board: The Shogunate hereby notifies everyone: those who report suspicious persons will be rewarded, while those who harbor them will be punished!
Bulletin Board: Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!

## Talk 3

Bulletin Board: The Vision Hunt Decree operation is coming to an end, but those who conceal their Visions still remain.
Bulletin Board: Following the orders of the Tenryou Commissioner, and in compliance with the command of Madam Kujou Sara, pursuit operations will avoid using force or disrupting the public as much as possible.
Bulletin Board: Please don't worry. The Tenryou Commission will not use its public duties as an excuse to intrude on your daily lives.
Bulletin Board: The Tenryou Commissioner guarantees this in his own name, and that of the Kujou Clan.

## Talk 4

Bulletin Board: "Kujou Tengu! I'm here on the Commercial Street. Stop hiding!"
Bulletin Board: "Crawl out of whatever hole you're in and fight me fair and square!"
Bulletin Board: "This one's for taking my Vision away! An eye for an eye!"
Bulletin Board: Everyone, no need to worry! This fellow is just a small-time hooligan.
Bulletin Board: Madam Kujou Sara promises that she has nothing to do with this person and that she will handle these messages immediately.

## Talk 5

Bulletin Board: "Though this is not a serious matter, I still hope that it will become more common knowledge."
Bulletin Board: "The other day, I accidentally lost the only extant copy of the famous 'Toki Alley Tales,' written by Takizawa Kyouden."
Bulletin Board: "Though it's nothing major, Lady Yae still insisted that I post a lost book notice to look for it. Ah, what a headache..."
Bulletin Board: "That poor book has probably had its pages scattered to the winds by now... I don't suppose it would be possible to find it at this point."
Bulletin Board: "It really is nothing of note, but if anyone could help recover it, you will have the Yae Publishing House's thanks."

## Talk 6

Bulletin Board: "I am about to leave my parents and sister. Though I come from a martial family, the thought of war still makes me uneasy."
Bulletin Board: "Is the war really necessary? Will Her Excellency the Ogosho really take responsibility for the war and for every one of us?"
Bulletin Board: "As a samurai, perhaps now is not the time for doubt."
Bulletin Board: A samurai should never have cold feet before a battle, nor should they doubt our Shogun's decisions.
Bulletin Board: I urge you to turn yourself in for posting inappropriate messages in public. You will receive a lighter sentence of detainment and re-education.
Bulletin Board: Removing or defiling this message is prohibited.

## Talk 7

Bulletin Board: Citizens of Inazuma, please stay alert while traveling at night. A monster in the form of a tanuki has been spotted around the city lately.
Bulletin Board: This monster appears to be infant-sized. It moves very quickly and is quite fierce!
Bulletin Board: Please report to a nearby Doushin or to the Tenryou Commission upon seeing it!
Bulletin Board: "I've told you, it's not a tanuki! Not a tanuki! Not. A. Tanuki. You hear!?"
Bulletin Board: "It's a mujina! A. Mujina!"

## Talk 8

Bulletin Board: "Due to the current situation, Ogura Textiles & Kimonos is going through some tough times. We can't just sit here and do nothing."
Bulletin Board: "Miss Ogura's father was once a relative of the Kujou Clan. If we don't help each other, that would put the samurai name to shame."
Bulletin Board: "Please don't worry, Miss Ogura. We'll round up some old friends, and we'll help you get through this tough time."
Bulletin Board: "I really appreciate your kindness on my late father's account, but I am afraid I must decline."
Bulletin Board: "I don't want to trouble everyone over such a small matter. I am sure that my brother and I can make it through."
Bulletin Board: "Miss Ogura, you really are just like your father."

## Talk 9

Bulletin Board: Please do not post notices everywhere!
Bulletin Board: Anyone found posting notices without authorization will be punished!

## Talk 10

Bulletin Board: "Ms. Kozue of the Komore Teahouse is very lovely."
Bulletin Board: "Although she has a sharp tongue, a bad temper, and it really hurts when she hits you with the back of her sword..."
Bulletin Board: "But she is really lovely."
Bulletin Board: The local Police Station has already opened a file based on a lawsuit lodged by Miss Kozue. Please report any leads that you may have.
Bulletin Board: This message will be used for handwriting recognition. Removing or defiling it is prohibited.

## Talk 11

Bulletin Board: "General Gorou was here."
Bulletin Board: Please don't make such terrible jokes!

## Talk 12

Bulletin Board: "I visited Kamisato Ayato earlier and was surprised at how young he is."
Bulletin Board: "Compared to his sister Kamisato Ayaka, he is a lot more determined and mature. With a family head like him, the Kamisato clan surely has a bright future."
Bulletin Board: "Thank you for your kind words about my brother."

## Talk 13

Bulletin Board: Bounty: Yoshino Koheiji, Yoshino Koheita
Bulletin Board: Crimes committed: Absconding, robbery, night-time assaults, conspiring against officials, distributing belongings to innocent villagers to incite rebellion.
Bulletin Board: Wanted dead or alive with a generous bounty!

## Talk 14

Bulletin Board: Bounty: Midorikawa Shirou
Bulletin Board: Crimes committed: Absconding, riotous assembly, piracy, robbing officials, ambushing samurai, holding family members as hostages in an attempt to rebel against the Shogunate.
Bulletin Board: This person and his accomplices are wanted dead or alive with a generous bounty!

## Talk 15

Bulletin Board: "Thanks to the careful consideration of Tenryou Commissioner Kujou Takayuki, the Vision Hunt Decree was implemented swiftly, preventing those who opposed it from fleeing."
Bulletin Board: "The real estate assets of the fugitives will be rented out or sold today. The Tenryou Commission guarantees the legitimacy of these transactions!"

## Talk 16

Bulletin Board: With the permission of Guuji Yae Miko, the Grand Narukami Shrine will provide help to those businesses and families affected by the war in the form of aid loans and food aid.
Bulletin Board: We ask that those in need of help visit the Kamisato Clan to file the required paperwork.
Bulletin Board: As the war continues and public funds become more tight, food aid will be reduced by half. We apologize for any inconvenience.
Bulletin Board: "I'd just like to say a big thank you to Lady Yae and the Yashiro Commissioner for their consideration. It's just that there are way too many people here everyday for food aid..."
Bulletin Board: "People are not receiving the daily allotment of food aid that they are supposed to. What should we do..."
Bulletin Board: I am sorry, but we don't have a better way. Lady Yae and the Commissioner are doing their best to handle the situation.

## Talk 17

Bulletin Board: The fight against the rebels proceeds apace. Only one more strike, and they shall be destroyed completely.
Bulletin Board: We hope that all young samurai will join together and fight to accomplish this great work!
Bulletin Board: Come join the army! Or you may regret not having done anything for your country when the war is over!
Bulletin Board: Please visit the Tenryou Commission for information about joining the army.
Bulletin Board: Attention! Families that have received draft orders must send at least one adult to join the military.
Bulletin Board: "This war is a monster that devours people..."
Bulletin Board: What right do those who haven't joined the army have to criticize the war effort? It's because the rebels have been defeated that you are able to sit here and whine!
Bulletin Board: "Is that so? My husband wounded my younger brother on Yashiori Island. He may never walk again."
Bulletin Board: "I haven't heard anything from my husband since then... Perhaps he was killed by some rebel? And who's to say that that rebel was never once an honorable samurai?"
Bulletin Board: "Forgive me, but I do not see the point of this war. I will no longer send people to join the army."
Bulletin Board: Just because these posts are anonymous doesn't mean you are free to spread slander. Such anti-war sentiment is naught but part of the Sangonomiya rebel's propaganda campaigns!
Bulletin Board: Defacing of military draft notices is prohibited! Anyone caught will face severe punishment!

## Talk 18

Bulletin Board: "The Yae Publishing House's reader's forum will take place as planned. All are welcome, regardless of whether they come from territories controlled by the Shogunate or the rebels!"
Bulletin Board: Even though the ongoing war is a bitter one, Lady Yae Miko ensures equal treatment for all on account of sharing a common hobby.
Bulletin Board: As a major publishing house, isn't welcoming rebels to a leisure activity a bit much?
Bulletin Board: So long as our great Shogun doesn't forbid it, then it's perfectly fine. Shouldn't the Tenryou Commission refrain from making controversial remarks?
Bulletin Board: Besides, it seems a little out of order to label those who merely live under the dictatorship of the rebels "traitors."

## Talk 19

Bulletin Board: "I have taken a short break from the frontline on Yashiori Island to come home. My parents seem to have gotten a lot older, while my wife looks very exhausted."
Bulletin Board: "I feel very guilty about not spending more time with my family because of the war..."
Bulletin Board: "Inazuma seems to have become a lot more quiet. Friends who used to be talkative are now mostly silent."
Bulletin Board: "Strange. I thought my family would enjoy the war stories that I had sent home."

## Talk 20

Bulletin Board: "I, Tatsunosuke, hereby announce that the military strategy dojo will be permanently shut down starting today."
Bulletin Board: "The Path of the Sword is an art meant to protect others. It should not be used to kill our brothers."
Bulletin Board: "Lately, I have witnessed a lot of my disciples fighting against each other. Though I am no saint, my conscience was still pricked by it."
Bulletin Board: "It's time to put a stop to all this."
Bulletin Board: "This is why I am shutting the military strategy dojo down, and why I shall never reopen it. I've also forbidden my disciples from serving the Kujou Clan."

## Talk 21

Bulletin Board: "Despite this long period of peace, it seems that few are altogether willing to fight on behalf of our lords..."
Bulletin Board: "But if the eldest son of Lord Kujou is already on the frontline, then what have we to complain about?"
Bulletin Board: "And I've heard that Lord Masahito is an honorable man who looks after his soldiers. I wish I could be assigned to his command."
Bulletin Board: "Madam Kujou Sara is also a good commander... although she is famously strict with her soldiers, at least she is fair and no selfish motives."
Bulletin Board: "Leaders like them are rare in the Tenryou Commission..."
Bulletin Board: "I will stop talking about my superiors now, I think. Dear parents, please don't worry. I will come home triumphant soon, and I will bring our family honor!"

## Talk 22

Bulletin Board: "If it were up to me, I would expel all the outlanders in Ritou!"
Bulletin Board: "The war just won't end, and the Vision Hunt Decree remains in effect. I find it hard to believe that the outlanders have no hand in this at all!"
Bulletin Board: "Those outlanders must have some way of smuggling Visions and rebels into our country..."
Bulletin Board: "If only we could make the Sakoku Decree more strict. All these problems would be gone!"
Bulletin Board: Please don't spread rumors and defame outlanders!
Bulletin Board: The Vision Hunt Decree and the suppression of the rebels are also going very smoothly!
