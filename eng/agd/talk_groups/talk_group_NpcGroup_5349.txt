Venier: A hundred and thirty-six... Alright, fourteen more times, and we'll take a break!

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing?
Venier: Hehe, training, of course! Only through constant exercise of the body and soul can I defend this city and destroy the detestable barbarian invaders.
Venier: And at the same time, prove myself to the Sebastos as worthy of ascension!

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Venier: See you. Careful out there, now!

## Talk

Traveler: Eligibility for ascension, you say?
Venier: That's right. Those who wish to ascend must either possess extraordinary musical talent, or have proven themselves through equally outstanding achievements and loyalty.
Venier: I've not demonstrated much musicality in my life, so I can only secure ascension through ceaseless training!

## Talk

Traveler: I wish you success!
Venier: Haha, thank you for the encouragement, friend! I, too, wish for the Sebastos to choose you to ascend to immortal form!
