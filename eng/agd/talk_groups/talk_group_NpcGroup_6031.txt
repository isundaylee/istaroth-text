Traveler: Sorry, who's Moo?
Inna: He's a little Saurian from our tribe.
Inna: Ahh, he's not around here. Probably back at home playing with his new friend.
Inna: I think she's a kid from Fontaine. She's the wee small sort, and has a very cute nose...
Inna: Hehe, she's not a human and can't understand a word of what Moo's saying, but she seems to be getting along with him just fine.
Inna: I hope she stays a while to help Moo come out of his shell...

Traveler: You seem to care a lot about it.
Inna: Yeah! After all, they're our companions who live and fight by our side. We can't just think about our health alone, right?
Inna: Ah, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm a researcher, and I'm quite familiar with the way Saurians behave.
Inna: Some people call me the "Saurian Whisperer," but I don't actually understand their language. I just have a knack for observing how they behave and figuring out if they're sick or unhappy.
Inna: If you meet any Saurians that are behaving strangely, come find me. I'll do my best to help you pinpoint the problem and help find a solution.
