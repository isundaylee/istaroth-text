# To Thee My Tender Grief Confide


## Talk 1

Nantuck: Hey, young fisherman, I'm glad to see you. What's up, have you run into some trouble?
Nantuck: Come come, I am your experienced angling guide. You can let me know about any issues you're having.
Nantuck: It makes sense that Kujirai is still obsessed with finding the "Lunar Leviathan" as her wish is...
Nantuck: Alas, if she knew the truth about the "Lunar Leviathan" she would be devastated.
Traveler: What truth?
Nantuck: To be truthful, after from returning from the voyage, I did not stop researching about the "Lunar Leviathan". I finally found a clue in an ancient book.
Nantuck: Based on those clues, I went back out on the field and found out some shocking revelations.
Nantuck: I published my findings in a book, I heard it's doing well recently.
Nantuck: Here, I just happen to have a book left by the editor. The truth about the "Lunar Leviathan" is inside.
Paimon: Paimon wants to see too! Let Paimon get a look!
Paimon: "Regarding How The Lunar Leviathan Is Actually A Giant Sea Turtle" ... What a long title... Huh?
Paimon: A giant sea turtle? The "Lunar Leviathan" is a giant sea turtle?
Nantuck: That's right, the "Lunar Leviathan" is a giant sea turtle.
Nantuck: That night, what we saw was a giant sea turtle with long bioluminescent plants growing on its back.
Nantuck: It was a pregnant sea turtle that was looking for land to lay her eggs, which was how we found our way home.
Nantuck: So go back and tell Kujirai, you eventually have to face the facts.
Traveler: But, maybe this can be explained...
Nantuck: Seeing your expression, you probably don't believe me huh? But my research has evidence to back it up.
Nantuck: In the ancient tales, the "Lunar Leviathan" is an ancient creature, back when many animals lived on land.
Nantuck: Their ancestors were active in the Dragonspine area and you can even find fossils of them today.
Nantuck: I found some last time in <color=#00E1FFFF>Wyrmrest Valley</color>. If you don't believe me you can go see for yourself.

## Talk 5

Paimon: All that's left is some Ore Slag. Seems like someone took something from here.
Paimon: Eh?! Is that...a Treasure Hoarder?
Paimon: Could it be them who removed the object from the rock scraps?
Paimon: Quick! Follow them! Their encampment must be around here, whatever was hidden in the rock scraps must be there!
Traveler: Let's go.
Paimon: We have be to sneaky, very sneaky. We mustn't be caught.

## Talk 6

Kujirai Momiji: You guys are finally back, eh? Jiawei didn't come?
Traveler: He stayed in the village.
Kujirai Momiji: Oh? He's become a family man? Haha! That seems like something he would do.
Kujirai Momiji: After all, that was his wish...alright, for this reason, he is forgiven.
Kujirai Momiji: What about Nantuck? Did you guys find him?
Traveler: He wrote a Best-Selling book.
Kujirai Momiji: Never thought he'd actually be a writer, huh? Pretty talented, so what did he write about?
Paimon: Paimon knows! Paimon knows! The books called "Regarding How The Lunar Leviathan Is Actually A Giant Sea Turtle".
Kujirai Momiji: Oh, that's a long name...is it a light novel? Not bad... I'll go buy a copy and read it too... Hmm? Wait a minute.
Kujirai Momiji: "Regarding How The Lunar Leviathan Is Actually..." It's actually a...?!
Traveler: Mmhmm, it's actually a giant sea turtle.
Kujirai Momiji: What is this guy talking about? How could it be a giant sea turtle? Did he forget that we saw the "Lunar Leviathan" with our own eyes?
Paimon: We didn't believe it at first...until we went to the snowy mountains and found the fossil of the "Lunar Leviathan"... Here you go, the book and the fossil.
Kujirai Momiji: No, I don't believe this. It's not true...
Kujirai Momiji: You don't understand, our family comes from a long lineage of fishermen, and my father is also a famous fisherman in Inazuma.
Kujirai Momiji: He had spent decades chasing the "Lunar Leviathan" on the ocean, and once, he almost succeeded.
Kujirai Momiji: Although it was all for naught, my father didn't give up. It would be a great honor for a fisherman if he could catch the legendary "Lunar Leviathan."
Kujirai Momiji: But after the next trip to sea...he never came back.
Kujirai Momiji: ...
Kujirai Momiji: So, I won't believe such words easily, please help me out!
Traveler: What do you plan to do then?
Kujirai Momiji: I'm going back to find the items my father left behind. He chased the "Lunar Leviathan" all his life and left a lot of information behind. I'm sure I can find a way.
Kujirai Momiji: I have prepared some fishing training for you, please wait for my good news, I will have to ask you for help then.

## Talk 7

Old-School Qi: Hey, you guys, do you think this shabby rock is worth anything? It's so rare that it's hidden in the ore.
Fleein' Lin: Oh please, what do you mean by shabby rock, have you touched a book before in your life? It's called a fossil. A fossil, get it?
Fleein' Lin: Not only is it worth a fortune, this alone can buy half of Liyue Harbor! Go back and read more!
Klutzy Bazi: Really? Is it worth that much? Then, with what we have in the camp, wouldn't we be really weather?
Fleein' Lin: It's "wealthy!" You should go and read more too!
Paimon: Hey! That guy over there, hand over the fossil!
Fleein' Lin: Ah! Who is it? Darn...we've been spotted... Brothers, get them!
