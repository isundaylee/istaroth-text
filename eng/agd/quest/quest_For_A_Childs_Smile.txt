# For A Child's Smile


## Talk 1

Chongyun: Are all the ingredients ready?

## Talk 2

Little Le: Aw, the popsicle man is a ghost now, too!
Little Le: How did you know to look for me here...
Little Le: You didn't peek, did you?
Little Le: ...Did the popsicle man tell you where to find me?

## Talk 3

Little Le: Cold noodles! Cold noodles!
Dalong: I've never tasted cold noodles, I can't wait to try some...

## Talk 4

Little Le: Huh, you found me!? How did you know to look for me here...
Little Le: Heyyyy â€” you didn't peek, did you?

## Talk 5

Dalong: Ah, you found me!
Dalong: I can't believe I lost! I didn't expect you to be so good at this.

## Talk 6

Chongyun: I never expected you to find me so easily...
Traveler: It's only your first time.
Chongyun: I thought that this would be the perfect spot.
Chongyun: In fact, I'm well-versed in the methods of locating evil spirits, and I have lots of experience tracking down their hiding spots.
Chongyun: This spot is dusty and a bit gloomy, which gives off an unsettling energy. Evil spirits usually prefer such places.
Traveler: You're trying to use thaumaturgy to play hide-and-seek...
Chongyun: Yeah... I guess my experience as an exorcist doesn't apply very well.
Chongyun: Since I've been found, I guess I must admit my defeat.
Chongyun: It's a simple game, yet quite intriguing once you begin to play.
Traveler: Maybe we could play it together again sometime.
Chongyun: Sure, we could invite more friends to join us.
Chongyun: Let's go.
Traveler: Good thing you weren't the ghost.
Chongyun: Hehe, right. It might've taken me hours to find anyone.
Traveler: But you can be easily seen here.
Chongyun: Hmm... I guess I was so nervous that I neglected the most important thing.
Traveler: ...Why would you hide here?
