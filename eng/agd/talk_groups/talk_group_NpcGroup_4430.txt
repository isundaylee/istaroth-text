Traveler: Still a believer?
Nayla: Yes, I still am. I'm an Eremite born and raised, and I grew up listening to legends of King Deshret. My beliefs will not be easily swayed.
Nayla: But I no longer believe in his revival.
Nayla: Huh, from the looks of it, I'd wager you're the new friend the boss talked about.
Nayla: The Eremites always welcome new hands, but I'll remind you that even friends are not forever.
Nayla: I, at least, will make you no guarantees that we'll always be on the same side.
