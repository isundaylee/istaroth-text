# Treasure Clue: Twinning Isle


## Talk 1

Captain Night Raven: You've gotten rid of them? Thank you so much!
Captain Night Raven: Alright, I'll tell you how to get through the fog and locate the clue...
Captain Night Raven: If you're ready, come look for me on the other side of the reef!

## Talk 2

Paimon: There's a statue here?
Captain Night Raven: *sigh*
Paimon: Hey there, why are you sighing alone at this cavern entrance?
Captain Night Raven: Well, I've been living here lately...
Paimon: You've been living in a place like this!?
Captain Night Raven: I didn't have a choice! A bunch of actors came to the island and started making a racket all day and all night. I couldn't even sleep because of them... So I found myself a quieter spot.
Captain Night Raven: But then a group of hilichurls came out of nowhere and occupied my resting place. So I had no choice but to brave the elements out here!
Captain Night Raven: *sigh* I swore to myself that if someone could help me, I'd tell them...
Paimon: Tell them what?
Captain Night Raven: Tell them about a clue to finding the legendary Secret Pirate Treasure! Although I only know a quarter of it...
Paimon: A quarter of a clue?
Captain Night Raven: You seem like you're here for the treasure too. So, what do you say? Get rid of the hilichurls in there and I'll give you the clue's location.
Captain Night Raven: They say that if you collect all four parts of the clue, you can find the treasure that pirates left behind here!
Paimon: Well, you have a deal!

## Talk 3

Captain Night Raven: Well, are you ready?
Captain Night Raven: I'll go ahead later and show you how to navigate the reefs on the way correctly!
Captain Night Raven: Alright, see that rock over there? First, you need to travel in that direction!

## Talk 4

Captain Night Raven: How did it go? Have you gotten rid of the hilichurls inside?
