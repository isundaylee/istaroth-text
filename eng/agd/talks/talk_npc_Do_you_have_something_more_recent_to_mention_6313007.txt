Traveler: ...Do you have something more recent to mention?
Shirai: Huh... Looks like this batch isn't good enough for you.
Shirai: Well, how about this then! The Sakoku Decree, enforced for so long, is now finally a thing of the past!
Shirai: Will the re-opened sea routes bring hope? Or more foes?
Shirai: Would you like to know more? Well, if you're curious, then you've gotta show your appreciation for such detailed intel, you know?
