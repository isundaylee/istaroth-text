# The Lost Relic


## Talk 1

Bao'er: Come on, where is it...
Traveler: What are you doing?
Bao'er: Wah! Where'd you come from!? How'd you sneak up so quietly...
Bao'er: Me? I'm... a researcher. I'm looking into the historical architecture and relics of the Guili Plains. Y—You can call me Bao'er.
Bao'er: I was so engrossed in my research that I've misplaced a package I carry round with me.
Bao'er: It's got an extremely rare trea... Uh, an extremely rare historical relic inside. Could you help me look for it?
Traveler: Okay.
Bao'er: Great! I think it was near here that I dropped it... or maybe a little further out. Anyway, please have a careful look.
Traveler: What does the package look like?
Bao'er: Y'know, just... an everyday box. Four sides, a top, and a bottom...
Bao'er: Why put a relic in there? Because... Having it in a box is more convenient.
Bao'er: I padded the box with some clothes to protect it from damage. Please, help me find it as quickly as you can.
Traveler: What kind of relic?
Bao'er: It's, uh... It's just a very precious relic. Ugh, you wouldn't understand even if I tried to explain it.
Bao'er: Only an expert like me can tell its true value. Please, help me find it as quickly as you can.

## Talk 3

Bao'er: Found it yet?
Traveler: Is this it?
Bao'er: Let me see... No, I—I don't think so... Feels too light, it's definitely not that relic inside...
Bao'er: But thanks anyway. I'll keep looking by myself.
Bao'er: Where did I lose it...
