Mayta: Oh no, you caught me.

Traveler: What was all that running around for?
Mayta: What do you mean, horsing around? I'm clearly training!
Mayta: The grown-ups all say that I'm super fast! They say I'm the speediest brat that they've ever seen.
Mayta: So I've got to work hard and play to my strengths, so I can eventually become the fastest warrior in the war against the Abyss!

Traveler: Fine. I'll let it slide.
Mayta: Hee-hee, then I'm off!

Traveler: A little bit right, but also a bit wrong.
Mayta: Huh? What do you mean?
Mayta: Oh, so like, my overall direction is right, but my methods are wrong? Kind of like that outlander guy by the small cliff over there?
Mayta: His problem is actually quite simple... He's just being too careful!
Mayta: Roca is always worried that he might get hurt, but you can't improve without picking up a scratch or two.
Mayta: If you ask me, I should go teach him instead. I'm so fast at climbing, I'm sure I'll be a good instructor as well. I'm sure he'll get the hang of it after falling a few times!
