# Talk Dialog

Asagiri: #I'll be counting on you to help me gather inspiration again, Traveler.
Traveler: How long will you be staying in Fontaine?
Asagiri: Huh. Well, I only just arrived, so I hadn't thought about that at all.
Asagiri: I mean, I haven't even been to any underwater areas here yet! It's chock-full of amazing sights, or so I've heard.
Asagiri: It's just that, ah, I need to learn how to dive for that. And there's so many things to remember... Ergh.
Asagiri: Guess it's best that I explore all the surface landscapes first.
Asagiri: Oh, right, and I do need to send a letter... I'm not going to get an earful about this, am I...
Traveler: Are your paintings a hit with the Fontainians?
Asagiri: They seem quite satisfied with my work, or so the feedback from the commissioning authors tells me.
Asagiri: But coming to that, I must say that there are vast differences between novels from Fontaine and Inazuma.
Asagiri: Especially when it comes to names! Remembering them has been so terribly taxing, so very vexing...
Traveler: See you around, then.
Asagiri: Alright, see you. I'm leaving the inspiration-gathering to you, alright?
