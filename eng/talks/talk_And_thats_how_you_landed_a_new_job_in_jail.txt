# Talk Dialog

Traveler: And that's how you landed a new job in jail.
Hugues: ...Yes.
Hugues: Even so, this job has some perks over my previous work at the Fontaine Research Institute.
Hugues: My time in Meropide was more conducive to creativity, to be honest, given the lack of complicated processes and boring summary meetings.
Hugues: Even my daily meals were delivered by clockwork machines. Such an enviable situation! A shame, though, that the canteen manager refused to sell me that machine.
