# Missing title (1399757127)


## Talk 1

Iwakura Mitsunari: Why did I leave the dojo to become Lord Kujou's instructor...
Iwakura Mitsunari: Yanagiha and Okazaki, as well as Mifune... why did they all leave me...

## Talk 2

Okazaki Toraemon: ...now, the blade of Iwakura Kouin is the only thing we're missing.
Yanagiha Arashi: The ancestral "Hakuen Michimitsu Amenoma" of the Iwakura Clan, huh... Say, do you remember, when you and Kunihiko were first adopted, while Master Eiin wasn't looking...
Okazaki Toraemon: We have already been expelled. There's no need to call him "Master."
Yanagiha Arashi: But Okazaki...
Yanagiha Arashi: "When you weigh affection against righteousness on a scale, a real swordsman must walk the path of righteousness."
Yanagiha Arashi: Since Master said so, it means he was not willing to expel us, but had no other choice.
Okazaki Toraemon: Of course he was unwilling. But since he has already decided to become the sword of the Shogun and carry out the Vision Hunt Decree, then we can only...
Yanagiha Arashi: We can only choose our own righteous path. After all, "a real swordsman must walk the path of righteousness."
Yanagiha Arashi: And yet, Master's own righteousness was defeated in the end.
Okazaki Toraemon: That's right. We must avenge them all. Kunihiko, the others â€” even Iwakura Kouin.
Okazaki Toraemon: Such is the righteousness of expelled disciples like ourselves.
Yanagiha Arashi: This must also be Master's blessing. Our first object of vengeance came to us, just like that.
Okazaki Toraemon: #You are right. You must be Traveler. I've heard about your story.
Okazaki Toraemon: In the world of swordsmen, only blood can cleanse blood. I assume you are prepared to face the Ex-Iwakura Art Menkyo Kaiden?

## Talk 3

Iwakura Mitsunari: Why did I leave the dojo to become Lord Kujou's instructor...
Iwakura Mitsunari: Yanagiha and Okazaki, as well as Mifune... why did they all leave me...
Traveler (player): I've encountered the disciples of the Iwakura Art.
Iwakura Mitsunari: Is that so...
Iwakura Mitsunari: Are there still people who claim to be from Iwakura? Their Master was such an incompetent soul, after all.
Iwakura Mitsunari: I am Iwakura Mitsunari. You could consider me a sword instructor here. And who might you be?
Traveler (player): #I'm Traveler.
Iwakura Mitsunari: Mifune, Tanba... did you see them? The Okazaki brothers, too?
Iwakura Mitsunari: Ah, yes, there's also Katayama. He always loved coming up with names for duels before they started.
Iwakura Mitsunari: He'd say, "If I become a real master swordsman in the future, then all these duels can written into stories." Hahaha, such nonsense...
Iwakura Mitsunari: Right, and we mustn't forget Shimada, who spent the entire "Eiin" and "Kouin" eras training, yet could never advance beyond the rank of Shoden.
Iwakura Mitsunari: They fled and became bandits because they could not fathom the power of the Almighty Shogun's Vision Hunt Decree.
Iwakura Mitsunari: I miss the good old days of teaching them how to wield a sword. Why in the world did I shut the dojo down and join the army?
Iwakura Mitsunari: #Traveler, how're their abilities?
Traveler (player): I'm sorry to say this, but...
Iwakura Mitsunari: Really...
Iwakura Mitsunari: #Then, Traveler, who is your master? Is it Domon? Or Shousen? Or perhaps Narukami herself?
Traveler (player): I think I might be considered "self-taught."
Iwakura Mitsunari: I see.
Iwakura Mitsunari: It seems like the Iwakura Art has waned under my watch. None of my students were able to defeat a self-learned swordsman.
Traveler (player): ...
Iwakura Mitsunari: Is that so? I understand.
Iwakura Mitsunari: Whatever your school of swordsmanship is, it doesn't matter.
Iwakura Mitsunari: It seems like the Iwakura Art has waned under my watch. None of my students were able to defeat someone who is unwilling to reveal the name of their school.
Iwakura Mitsunari: I truly am an incompetent Master of the Iwakura Art. As a swordsman, they call me Iwakura Kouin.
Iwakura Mitsunari: Although I have forgotten the key to our secret blade technique and my Vision was surrendered to the Almighty Shogun...
Iwakura Mitsunari: ...If you asked me if I still wish to avenge those disciples of mine who could not bear to see my degradation and wound up pursuing the path of wicked ghosts...
Iwakura Mitsunari: ...Yet who were incompetent and lost to you, then I do still have some of that fire within me.
Iwakura Mitsunari: This space is too small. It would be no place for even you to show off your swordsmanship. Come, follow me down.
Traveler (player): I learned quite a bit.
