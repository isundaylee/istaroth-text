Traveler: Mizuki's "A Little Fox's Dayâ€”"
Yae Miko: Hmm?
Traveler: (You quickly cut yourself off upon sensing a sharp look from Miko.)
Yae Miko: What an interesting take on the theme... Tell me, did it come from Miss "Sole of the Deep" or my dear, old friend?
Traveler: You're not going to charge them for using your likeness, are you...?
Yae Miko: Heh, not a bad idea. But, I'm more interested in seeing how this plays out, which means... turning a blind eye, for now.
