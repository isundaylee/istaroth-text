Traveler: About that potion...
Yasmin: Are you talking about that potion we sprinkled around the last time?
Yasmin: Hmm... Ladep and Pharez are still trying to make adjustments.
Yasmin: The effect was good indeed, but the "physiolocial emetic" that Ladep added really made other people quite uncomfortable.
Yasmin: And I don't know why, but this potion also attracts Fungi.
Yasmin: I hope Ladep can come up with an improved formula soon...

Traveler: Take care.
Yasmin: You, too.
Yasmin: I'll probably need your help again when I sprinkle the potion next time. Please lend me a hand by then.

Traveler: Are the two of them okay?
Yasmin: Regarding their academic achievements, they are very happy now. They've collected empirical data, and their research turned out to be fruitful.
Yasmin: But in terms of their everyday lives, they weren't even eating anymore, and their sleep patterns were terribly skewed...
Yasmin: In their own words... This is the price of doing research.
