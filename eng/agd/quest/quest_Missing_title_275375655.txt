Traveler: About Hanfeng's Ironmongers...
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": I built that business up from nothing to what it is today. The heart's still willing... but unfortunately, the body has grown weak.
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": Sometimes I forget about my old age, you know. I'll go out for a walk, gather a few Iron Chunks out of habit, and only when I bring them back does it finally dawn on me that I can't even lift a hammer anymore...
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": Take 'em, if you can use them... If you ever have the chance, go pay a visit to my son in Liyue Harbor. He's now just as good as his old man was back in his prime.
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": And if you do visit him, please give him a message from me: Tell him his old man's safe and well.
