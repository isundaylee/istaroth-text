Traveler: And so you acted on your own?
Tahmures: I'd like to call it "seizing a great academic opportunity with great precision."
Tahmures: The Children of Echoes and their Saurian partners are all very adept at digging, so I hired the seasoned Mr. Akeor as my archaeological partner.
Tahmures: ...But in all honesty, I feel a sense of urgency to get on with my research. When they pick up antiques, the people of Natlan tend to just use them as tools... It's genuinely terrifying to watch.
Tahmures: But you know how things have been in Natlan lately. Akeor already went off to fight the monsters with his Saurian, and I couldn't allow my personal affairs to cause a delay to his mission.
Tahmures: And it seems like my research could actually help him out on the battlefield... That really would be amazing if so.
