Traveler: How's your work coming along?
Ellin: Oh, you mean the love poem I'm writing for Master Jean! Iâ€”I'm still working on it!
Ellin: Professor Venti was teaching us tricks for writing love poems, yes, but what I'd like to express is more like admiration and yearning.
Ellin: I did write a poem, but I haven't had the time to send it to the Professor just yet... Would you like to hear it?
Traveler: Lay it on me.
Ellin: "Your earnest profile working
Like the moon in the night sky gleaming
It leads me into restful dreaming"
Ellin: How is it? Will it do?
Traveler: I can feel your sincerity!
Ellin: Really? That's great! That's exactly what I'd like to express!
Ellin: Thank you! I'll make a few more improvements, and then I'll hand it in.
Traveler: Very passionate indeed...
