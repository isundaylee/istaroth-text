# The Day the Sword Departs


## Talk 1

Sun Yu: This's the place. Let's do it!

## Talk 2

Sun Yu: *huff* That was tough...
Sun Yu: I apologize. Look at me, making a fool of myself. I didn't expect that I would be so nervous when confronting real monsters...
Sun Yu: Needless to say, I still need more training. Anyway, thank you, Traveler. Please, take these as your reward.
Traveler: Are you really leaving?
Sun Yu: I haven't fully decided yet. I still need more time to think it through. Meanwhile, I'll see if I can convince Que'er to leave with me...
