## Talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: Indeed. A fellow named Tingfang ordered some Jueyun Chili Chicken and asked for a delivery.
Chef Mao: This Jueyun Chili Chicken won't hold up if you *fly or climb all over the place, if you touch anything elements, or if you take too long*. Neglect one of these and you could ruin the taste.
Chef Mao: If something happens along the way, come back here and I'll make another serving. Whatever you do, don't bring the name of Wanmin Restaurant down.
