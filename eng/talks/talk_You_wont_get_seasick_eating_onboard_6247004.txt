Traveler: You won't get seasick eating onboard?
Lianfang: That's exactly it!
Lianfang: Chef Baatjan has improved our cuisine by adding a variety of supplemental ingredients while maintaining the dishes' original taste...
Lianfang: These supplemental ingredients greatly alleviate the symptoms of seasickness experienced by our diners, so they naturally feel better!
Lianfang: Some repeat customers even pay us a special visit before boarding to purchase some refreshments. They say that even the worst winds and waves are nothing to fear while they have our victuals in hand. It's great, right?
