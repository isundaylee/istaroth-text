Traveler: How's things with your little brother?
Kujou Masahito: My brother Kamaji is currently serving as the Provisional Clan Head in Inazuma City. Being a military man first and foremost, I will support him as best I can.
Kujou Masahito: Now that our clan is in crisis, there will be those who may have a change of heart, never mind how the Almighty Shogun has yet to pass final judgment upon us. There is still much to be concerned about.
Kujou Masahito: I've heard that it was you who accompanied the Shogun to rescue my brother from the hands of the Takatsukasa Clan. I, Masahito, will not forget this favor.
Kujou Masahito: His faith in restoring our clan seems to have been renewed after that incident as well. I, too, believe that there is hope.
