Traveler: You're a Mondstadter?
Vermeer: Yes, why so surprised? There are plenty of Mondstadters living in Liyue. I guess the winds of freedom blew us all over this way, haha!

Traveler: What are you up to?
Vermeer: As you can see, I'm a painter. I believe that wherever you go in the world, no matter how drab a place might seem, you can always find some color if you look closely enough.
Vermeer: I consider it my duty to travel all around the seven nations to discover brand new colors and then put them on a canvas for all to see!
Traveler: Are you looking for inspiration?
Vermeer: Yep! I saw this pool and thought, wow, what a magnificent sight!
Vermeer: Can you see why? You've got that cool blue of the water's surface contrasted with the slightly off-white cliff face, interspersed with bits of lush green vegetation... I just want to recreate every last bit of it on the canvas!

Vermeer: Hello... Oh! You're the traveler, aren't you!
Vermeer: I heard the story about your death-defying battle with Dvalin!
