# Talk Dialog

Traveler: How do you get on with your modern family?
Olaf: Well, I have skipped over so many centuries that try as we might, Draff and I cannot figure out where exactly I fit in the family tree, and therefore how we should address one another.
Olaf: So we just gave up and started using first names instead. You have got to overlook some things when you are in a strange situation like this, do you not think?
Olaf: Being related by blood does seem to give us an inexplicable connection though. Draff and I are complete strangers, and yet we keep finding that we just have so much in common.
Olaf: ...Especially when it comes to drinking. It comforts me to know that hundreds of years on, Mondstadt still has such excellent taste in alcohol.
Olaf: But every time we start talking about it, his little girl Diona gives me this dirty look that really makes her great-great-great... I don't know how many greats it is but anyway, it really makes her Granddad of indeterminate great-hood feel... greatly aggrieved.
