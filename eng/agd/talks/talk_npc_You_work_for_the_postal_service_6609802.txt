Traveler: You work for the postal service?
Hoa: More or less. Us Scions of the Canopy are quite adept at traveling through the woods at high speed, so we took on most of the messenger work.
Hoa: We'd establish Courier Longhouses all over Natlan, and help the tribes deliver letters and packages.
Hoa: Sometimes, we'd also help the tribes recruit people for events, or coordinate collaborations between different tribes.
