Traveler: About the Plume of Purifying Light...
Fedhri: Plumes of Purifying Light are fragments of memory. Memories belonging to the divine bird, Pari, and humans. All those memories unable to return to the tree and the land will eventually become Plumes of Purifying Light.
Fedhri: Although, should you offer them to the Amrita Pool, all memories will be accepted.
Fedhri: You'll have to find those memories scattered across the land that have yet to become Plumes of Purifying Light.
