Traveler: About Gendou Ringo...
Inagi Hotomi: Ah yes. I do believe that people have been saying that her attitude's gotten a lot better recently.
Inagi Hotomi: Although rather than calling it an attitude adjustment, it might be more accurate to say that "she seems like a different person," no?
Traveler: ...
Inagi Hotomi: Haha. Not to worry, everyone at the shrine already knew, more or less.
Inagi Hotomi: Although I'm not privy to the details, if Lady Yae has allowed her to stay at the shrine, then she is someone we can trust.

Traveler: About the Cleansing Ritual...
Inagi Hotomi: Lady Yae did ask us to make some arrangements for the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual earlier.
Inagi Hotomi: Later, she said that new developments had precluded the need for us to continue our preparations. She even asked me to give the Memento Lens to a blond-haired outlander.
Inagi Hotomi: I never expected that the "new development" that Lady Yae mentioned was you.
Inagi Hotomi: You have my thanks. I do not know how you managed it, but healing the Sacred Sakura was no mean feat. You have my utmost thanks as a shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine.

Traveler: Could you tell me more about the Grand Narukami Shrine?
Inagi Hotomi: The Grand Narukami Shrine is a place for making offerings and performing ceremonial affairs. Everything here is done according to the will of Her Excellency the Electro Archon.
Inagi Hotomi: Lady Yae Miko is the head shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine. She is in charge of everything here.
Inagi Hotomi: But Lady Yae is very busy indeed, and she is also the boss of Yae Publishing House. So when she is not around, I will take over some of her work.
Inagi Hotomi: If you need any help from the shrine, feel free to ask me.

Traveler: Everyone's wishes, huh...
Inagi Hotomi: Yes... I've been in charge of greeting the people coming here for fortune slips for a while now, and I have heard all sorts of wishes from all manner of people.
Inagi Hotomi: Many who came here recently wished for the Sakoku Decree to be lifted soon...
Inagi Hotomi: The Electro Archon... Hm, never mind.
Inagi Hotomi: As a shrine maiden, I should always follow and serve the Electro Archon. My life for the Eternal Narukami.

Traveler: Could you tell me about Hanachirusato...
Inagi Hotomi: Hanachirusato? I don't believe that any such person works at the Grand Narukami Shrine...
Inagi Hotomi: Speaking of which, we found an antique kitsune mask while cleaning up the shrine hall. It seems to have once belonged to Lady Kitsune Saiguu.
Inagi Hotomi: If you don't mind, would you like to have it? Since you were the one who completed the Cleansing Ritual, I believe there must be some fate that ties you, Lady Saiguu, and the shrine together.
Inagi Hotomi: It's become a little fragile with its great age, so you can't really wear it, but I believe it must at least bear some sentiments and blessings from bygone years.
