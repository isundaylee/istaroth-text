# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Why would I want your autograph?
Wuyuan: Hah. Trying to act like you don't know me so you stand out more, is that it?
Wuyuan: Hmph, like I haven't seen that one before! But I'm feeling nice today, so I'll play along with your little game.
Wuyuan: My pen name is Wuyuan â€” yes, the author of Records of Jueyun, in the flesh!
Wuyuan: I'm currently on a trip recording local myths and legends from all over Liyue.
Wuyuan: So if you have an interesting story to share, let me know! And if it ends up in my book...
Wuyuan: ...Maybe I will give you a free signed copy as a thank-you!
Traveler: Do you have any interesting stories?
Wuyuan: In truth, I've been on the trail of information concerning the Guardian Yaksha lately, which may eventually feature in my "Records of Jueyun."
Wuyuan: It's a pity, but there just isn't much to find right now except a few scattered, nondescript texts.
Wuyuan: I've heard people say that they caught sight of an adeptus at Dihua Marsh, and I had a hunch that this might be the Guardian Yaksha...
Wuyuan: But I reckon that I can just stay here and wait. After all, I am an author whose pen has been touched by the heavens themselves. Why, the material will come to me as a matter of course!
