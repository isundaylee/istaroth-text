Traveler: About the wine from your hometown...
Gregor: Clear and cool water from Cider Lake can grant any wine a tint of sweetness...
Gregor: *sigh* That being said, I've only had it once.
Gregor: Before my departure, my friends and family held a banquet specially for me at the Cat's Tail. At that time, I had just come of age and was about to leave for Sumeru.
Gregor: Later, my parents wrote in several letters that they knew some merchants who could bring me some cider.
Gregor: But I refused for fear that my homesickness would grow stronger.
Gregor: Thankfully my parents are both very healthy, so I don't have to worry about them when I'm away. I can be reunited with them once I graduate from here.
