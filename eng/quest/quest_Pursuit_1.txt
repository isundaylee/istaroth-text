# Pursuit


## Talk 1

Traveler: ...

## Talk 2

Canotila: #{M#Mr.}{F#Ms.} {NICKNAME}! Wait, why isn't Paimon with you?
Traveler: That rift... What are you looking at?
Canotila: What rift? Isn't this a mirror?
Canotila: Well, speaking of that, there is something that I've been looking for.
Canotila: I'm trying to find clues to the Looking Glass. It looks like a painting, and lets people meditate in a similar manner to the Book of Revealing.
Traveler: About the four orthants and the painting in the Tower of Gestalt...
Canotila: #...Really? So it's in a place like that? Okay! Thank you, {M#Mr.}{F#Ms.} {NICKNAME}.

## Talk 3

Canotila: Argh... Please, help...
Traveler: (It's coming from over there. Gotta be quick.)

## Talk 4

Canotila: #Here, {M#Mr.}{F#Ms.} {NICKNAME}! Help me...

## Talk 5

Canotila: #Thanks, {M#Mr.}{F#Ms.} {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: What happened?
Canotila: I don't know. I just wanted to see the blooming sunflowers and the cute puppy...
Canotila: But a monster came after me, and the sky got darker. I heard many voices talking about things that I didn't understand.
Canotila: I was scared, so I followed the golden light and ran forward.
Canotila: The world got a little darker whenever the monster came near. The garden, the palace, the great trees, and the flowers all disappeared. It was very gloomy, and I only saw ruins...
Canotila: And then the monster caught up to me...
Traveler: You don't have to worry now.
Traveler: Puppy, please send her back.
Unknown NPC (21098): Don't come around here anymore, little one. There's nothing here, but there's a whole world waiting for you out there.
Canotila: Huh? Are you the puppy? But...
Canotila: ...Will I see you again? Will this world become a beautiful garden again?
Unknown NPC (21098): No. Goodbye.
Unknown NPC (21098): And you, let me ask you one more time. What am I in your eyes?
Traveler: A dog.
Unknown NPC (21098): That's good. You just got rid of someone who shouldn't be here, and thanks to you, this world's collapse has stopped.
Unknown NPC (21098): But it is unwise for any of you to stay all the same.
Traveler: I figured as much. Please send me back.
Unknown NPC (21098): A wise choice. Farewell.
Traveler: What's going on?
Unknown NPC (21098): This world was going to disintegrate, because someone who shouldn't be here arrived, shaking the foundations of this world.
Traveler: Is that why I saw what I saw?
Unknown NPC (21098): I don't know what you experienced. I am not you, after all.
Traveler: And who are you then?
Unknown NPC (21098): ...That is not important. What's important is the masters of this imaginary world.
Unknown NPC (21098): They believed that they could save the world, but they didn't know if this world actually needed to be saved. Maybe the world in their memories was but an afternoon forever bereft of blooming sunflowers.
Unknown NPC (21098): But those are their stories and not mine. I'm just a memory that they have of their friend. They once believed that they could save me, but ultimately...
Unknown NPC (21098): The butterfly became a cocoon, and a larva emerged from the cocoon. Then, the larva returned to the void that was never born.
Unknown NPC (21098): But none of these things matter. I have nothing left. I am just a shadow in their memories, left behind by their obsession to save me.
Unknown NPC (21098): I don't hate them, though. Even if they changed after losing me, my existence in this world of memories and delusions is proof of their persistence.
Unknown NPC (21098): As someone who was once their friend, I am more than satisfied. No matter what I become, I am forever grateful for the friendship we once had.
Unknown NPC (21098): Anyway, let's end it here. You can feel the influence this place has on you, can't you?
Unknown NPC (21098): Farewell. We won't see each other again.

Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, are you still going to meditate?
Traveler: We haven't found Canotila yet.
Traveler: I'm going to need you to give me another moment, Paimon.
Paimon: Uh... Okay then! It's just a blink of an eye anyway. Paimon's not worried at all!
Paimon: #Still, be careful, {NICKNAME}.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Whoa!
Traveler: Paimon, I...
Paimon: That was super fast! Paimon didn't even have time to blink...
Traveler: ...That's a relief.
Paimon: #Alright! Our little troublemaker's back! Canotila, you made {NICKNAME} really worried, you know?
Canotila: I...
Canotila: *sob* I'm sorry...
Paimon: Huh? Paimon's not blaming you! Don't cry, Canotila. Come on, Paimon will give you something delicious to eat...
Paimon: (What happened?)
Traveler: (We encountered some danger inside.)
Paimon: (Oh...)
Paimon: Don't cry, Canotila, you're a brave, brave Melusine! Here, this is Paimon's favorite Chicken-Mushroom Skewer. Take it, it's all yours!
Canotila: *sob* Thank you so much, Paimon...
Canotila: *chewing*
Canotila: Whoa, such a strange taste! So this is what humans eat for their meals...
Paimon: Hey! If you don't want it, you can just give it back to Paimon!
Canotila: #But... Thank you. And thank you for saving me, {M#Mr.}{F#Ms.} {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: What do you plan to do next?
Canotila: I don't know, but I don't want to read books anymore.
Paimon: ...Canotila, isn't that a bit extreme?
Canotila: Well, um... The Book of Revealing is really scary...
Paimon: (So, what exactly happened?)
Traveler: (It's a long story...)
Traveler: (You'd only understand if you were there.)
Paimon: (What do you mean? Ugh, Paimon's getting annoyed...)
Canotila: ...Anyway, I don't want to stay here anymore. I want to live with everyone in Merusea Village.
Paimon: That's right! The other Melusines will take good care of you!
Canotila: #Thank you, {M#Mr.}{F#Ms.} {NICKNAME}, Paimon.
Traveler: (It's a good thing you didn't go.)
