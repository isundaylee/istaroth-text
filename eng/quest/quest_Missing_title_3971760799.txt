# Missing title (3971760799)

Scene Notes: This is a cut scene from the show "The Great Escape"
Scene Notes: The original story was about a Hydro Eidolon trapped in a mysterious cave, who could only use the tools hidden within a tome to escape to freedom...
Scene Notes: But Idyia outright rejected the idea.
Scene Notes: But she had a point, Hydro Eidolons wouldn't need tools to escape a cave, they could just leave whenever they wanted. Also, hiding tools in a book was a bit contrived.
Scene Notes: But... this is definitely a blockbuster idea! If only Idyia could see just how brilliant it is...
Scene Notes: But, alas, first the <color=#00E1FFFF>tome containing the tools stolen by hilichurls</color> must be retrieved...
