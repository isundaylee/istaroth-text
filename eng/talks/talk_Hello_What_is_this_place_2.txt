Traveler: Hello. What is this place?
Cauich: Ah, this? It is the center of our tribal beliefs, the Obsidian Totem Pole. It is the symbol of the connection between the tribes and the Night Kingdom.
Cauich: Not everyone here can communicate with the Wayob through these totems, though.
Cauich: Only a very small number of distinguished, or notably powerful individuals can accomplish that, and most of them are Masters of the Night-Wind.
Cauich: Still, you may yet get a response from it if you help our tribe with some commissions.
Cauich: Manpower's always at a premium, so it's definitely worth a shot.
