Remande: Er... Does "the aquabus repairman might've been put in a bad mood by my many questions" count?
Remande: I'm kidding! The repairman's great. He told me that there was a place nearby that produces Condessence Crystals, which I can use to make models.
Remande: That said, I don't think I'd be any good at excavation by hand â€” might be better to just buy the ore pre-processed. But if you have need of them, you can check the place out.
