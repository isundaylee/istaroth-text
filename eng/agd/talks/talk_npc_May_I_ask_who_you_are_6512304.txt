# Talk Dialog

Traveler: May I ask who you are?
Yvette: Right, forgot to introduce myself. I'm the technical advisor to the Spina di Rosula. I might be old, but my hands and brain still work just fine.
Yvette: Now, don't let the headaches I get with greenhorns who keep breaking things fool you — I very much enjoy my work here at the Spina.
Yvette: Back when I was at the Fontaine Research Institute, I quit on my own — too hard working with people with my crappy temper.
Yvette: As it turned out, that was a smart decision. Otherwise, you might have had to find my bones at the bottom of the sea.
Yvette: Things are different here. Doesn't matter if you're eight or eighty. So long as you've the ability, there's a place for you to use it.
