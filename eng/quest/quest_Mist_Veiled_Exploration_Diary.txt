# Mist Veiled Exploration Diary


## Talk 1

Read: "Walk to the view of the changing tide, arrive to the sight of a misty shroud. Ascend to Jueyun Karst up in the skies, sit and gaze at the unfurling clouds."

## Talk 2

Read: "At the southernmost point is a shortcut, a meandering mountain road. Those who seek mysteries hidden in the clouds, watch the seas' tides above and below."

## Talk 3

Read: "Black clouds too shall pass, just as silver linings end. Come sun or rain, all seems the same from the heights of Jueyun Karst."

## Talk 4

Read: "The one who may ascend is the one who <color=#00E1FFFF>kowtows atop the three mountains</color>. The sun, moon, and stars shall each shine, and auspicious signs shall be sent by the <color=#00E1FFFF>three divine birds</color>."
Paimon: Ugh... It's a real headache trying to make sense of the adepti and all this other stuff in Liyue.
Paimon: This must mean we have to find three shining birds on top of three mountains, right?

## Talk 5

Read: "This place above the clouds is built on a foundation of Plaustrite, one of the marvels of the world. Its original purpose was to serve as my private sanctuary, somewhere where I could get away from the world and escape the highs and lows of normal life.
Read: Then the adepti took over the place as somewhere they could focus on seeking ultimate truth in seclusion. Now that Taishan Mansion is sealed off, they finally returned the place to me.
Read: It's great to have it back, but I'm over it now. I want to go back to the world for a bit — I'll probably start with Guili Plains. Fitting, really — a round trip to the Plains of Returning and Departing, as they're also known... Hover around for a while, then hover away on a hovering stone... Heh."
