# Talk Dialog

Yoimiya: Want to get some shut-eye and rest for a bit? I'll keep you company!
Yoimiya: Or... If you're not sleepy, how about we chat for a bit? Maybe I could tell you a story!
Yoimiya: Oh, sorry! Am I talking too much? Hehe, I just get so excited when I'm in a new place â€” I wanna see everything there is to see. I've always got the energy to explore!
