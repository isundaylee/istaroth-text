# Court of Justice's Booming Commerce

Based on the Quartier Lyonnais in the Court of Fontaine, this place is filled with tons of Fontainian specialty stores and tables at which to also rest and enjoy some tea.
Some experienced tourists will tell you that you can ask the residents here if you are unfamiliar with the stores and characteristics of the goods on sale. Since many stores strictly follow the price controls set by the Palais Mermonia, very few people will purchase items with incongruent prices.
This Furnishing Set is favored by the following companions: Lynette, Lyney, Chiori
