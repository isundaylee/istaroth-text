# Spike Self-Circulation Report: Conclusion

Hosseini: How did it go? Did you manage to operate the Spike successfully?
Traveler: Yes. It went well.
Hosseini: Good, good. Though the Pursina's Spike cannot seal the opening in one go, as long as it is successful once, continued operation should not be an issue.
Hosseini: This means that it's really just a matter of time before the opening closes completely.
Hosseini: Our problem is, therefore, solved.
Hosseini: I must record this... For all I know, I may yet become a figure of some influence in the Akademiya once the full research report on the Pursina's Spikes is submitted.
Hosseini: #I might even write it into my future memoirs. I can see it now: "My Experiments With the Preternaturally Skilled Traveler at The Chasm..."
Traveler: I'll be waiting eagerly for that day to come.
Hosseini: Haha! Well, I fear I'm not hardly as good at writing stories as I am at reports.
Hosseini: I can only hope that you'll forgive any flaws in my work.
Traveler: Most of the dark mud is gone.
