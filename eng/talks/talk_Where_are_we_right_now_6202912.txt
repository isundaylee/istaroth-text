# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Where are we right now?
Huixin: We are at Yuehai Pavilion. This is where the Qixing discuss official business and rule on major issues that affect the whole of Liyue.
Huixin: To serve the Qixing is to serve all of Liyue, so it is my honor to be working here.
Huixin: Sometimes I feel like the whole way I carry myself has become more dignified since I started working here. Hehehe.
Huixin: None of the big shots are here right now â€” presumably they're all busy with private business.
