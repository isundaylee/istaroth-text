Traveler: About Lumidouce Harbor...
Cassigneul: Lumidouce Harbor is one of the Court of Fontaine's most vital foreign trading ports. It also handles the bulk of the trade coming from the south.
Cassigneul: Due to such enormous volume, the former administrator, Mr. Doutey, had plans to expand the harbor.
Cassigneul: The intent was not only to increase the harbor's size, but also to construct numerous auxiliary facilities such as hotels, restaurants, and taverns.
Cassigneul: However, all plans had to be called off due to certain unforeseeable circumstances, and Mr. Doutey resigned from his position.
Cassigneul: After that, I was assigned to take over.
Cassigneul: *sigh* He was a good man, but he simply couldn't catch a break.
