Traveler: Why wolves?
Wolfy: Why not wolves? Many a tale has wolves in it, and even the compendium personally burned by Madame Mage had a wolf character!
Wolfy: It is said that the Boar Tribe were once all wild boars, but the boars did bad things, so the master wanted to punish them.
Wolfy: The master took out a rusted set of scales, and told the boars to stack their own things on both sides. If the scales tipped to one side, they could leave.
Wolfy: But the scales were so rusty that putting just a small amount of weight was not enough to move them.
Wolfy: Those boars who placed their heads on the scales became wolves, lizards, and snakes, leaving only their strength. Those who offered their muscles became rabbits, leaping three paces to a bound, instinctively guiding people to treasure.
Wolfy: But there was one boar who placed things evenly on both sides, until the rusted scale broke right down the middle...
Wolfy: And so she became a mute person — for she had placed her voice upon the scales as well.
Wolfy: She is also a friend of Madame Mage, and I hear she likes to speak in people's heads!

Traveler: About this room...
Wolfy: Madame Mage has said before, that this is the room "before the story begins and after the story ends." That's why guests have all the time they need to do whatever they'd like.
Wolfy: In addition, feel free to try out any of the furnishings you'd like! Whether changing the music, or divining fortunes, it's all "self-serve."
Wolfy: Though very convenient, it sure doesn't leave much for me to do as the concierge... *sigh*
Wolfy: Speaking of which, Madame Mage is really amazing! She can see the path of fate in the starry reflections. So, you should be really satisfied with the divination service she proposed, right?

Traveler: About the treasure chests in the room...
Wolfy: "The audience should support the wonderful performance put on by the guests most generously"... Or that's what I heard. Though they're only toy medals, they represent how much the audience approves of the show you put on!
Wolfy: That's also the reason these Toy Medals are the perfect currency to exchange for "Thespian Tricks."
Wolfy: So, when the brilliant golden glow of the treasure beckons, don't you hesitate, just go open it!

Traveler: About the cardboard in the performance venue...
Wolfy: That moment when you first step onto the stage, do you not feel anything different at all? Do you not feel the unique ambiance within the magic ring?
Wolfy: *sigh*... This is one thing even one such as I, the concierge, cannot help you with...
Wolfy: It is only when guests "believe" from the bottom of their hearts that it's all real that the doors to that special world open wide before them.
Wolfy: When that happens, dear guest, you will understand that performing is a game, but also a ceremony, and thus does it too possess the power of magic!

Traveler: About the storybooks...
Wolfy: You guys like to read storybooks? Me too!
Wolfy: I like to imagine I'm a character in the book when I read. Sometimes I'm Wolfy the Brave, others Wolfy the Wise... and sometimes, I'm even the Big Bad Wolfy!
Wolfy: "Awoooo! Foolish Traveler! You dare enter this fortress of doom without invitation! Prepare to be eaten alive!"
Wolfy: What do you think? Totally got that "Big Bad Wolf" energy, right?
Wolfy: ...These stories are like those dreams, they're all shining memories, treasures that belong only to me. They are also a weapon that makes me invincible, no matter what situation I may face.
