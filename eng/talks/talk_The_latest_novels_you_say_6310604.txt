Traveler: The latest novels, you say?
Kano Nana: Yeah! But it's not just the "latest" novel! It's the draft of a yet-to-be-published work!
Kano Nana: You have probably heard of Yae Publishing House already, right? The owner of this publishing house is the Guuji Yae herself, our head shrine maiden.
Kano Nana: Ever since Lady Yae learned that I am a novel enthusiast, she would often offer me the drafts of Yae Publishing House novels to read.
Kano Nana: Let me tell you a secret. When Lady Yae is acting as the boss of Yae Publishing House, she behaves very differently than she does as the Guuji. She's actually really kind and often asks me about my thoughts on these new novels.
Kano Nana: Hehe, if my silly comments can help her out, that's nice, then.
