Traveler: Long time no see!
Murakami: My, my, if it isn't Miss Kamisato's friend. Welcome!
Murakami: Ever since you brought Miss Kamisato here last time, we've been having more and more people come to try our Sakura Mochi and Egg Rolls!
Murakami: I'll definitely take good care of you and Miss Kamisato the next time you two come again.
Murakami: Say, have you mastered the Sakura Mochi recipe just yet?
