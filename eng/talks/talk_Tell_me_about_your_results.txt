Traveler: Tell me about your results...
Dana: It was on Padisarah.
Dana: Do you know that there are very few plantations of Padisarah due to its harsh requirements for the environment?
Dana: If it's possible to develop a stabler variety, then it'll be able to greatly improve the efficiency of growing Padisarah.
Dana: I proposed quite an effective solution in my graduation paper. If I can stay in school and continue my research after graduation, I'm certain that I'll be able to make a bigger breakthrough.
