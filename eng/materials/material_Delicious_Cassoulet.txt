# Delicious Cassoulet

A simple rustic stew. Time is the most wondrous of weapons for catalyzing the creation of deliciousness, and time allows the meat in this dish to soak up the ocean of stewed flavor it is bathing in, becoming soft and fragrant. Together with the rich aroma of the beans, it conjures a warm delight in one's mouth that stirs the spirit.
