# Vintage Lyre

Use this traditional instrument from Mondstadt to play songs. It may work wonders when played in the forests of Sumeru.
A vintage lyre borrowed from Amadhiah in Vimara Village.
Mondstadt has a long-standing tradition of poetry and song. Bards from there tend to address their instruments as "Friend" or "Partner." Thus, one of them trusting Amadhiah with the instrument was nothing less than a gesture of intimacy and trust.
