Traveler: I have the utmost respect for Lady Ningguang.
Baixiao: Hmm... You are, indeed, a rare and honest sort â€” cut from a different cloth from those honey-tongued merchants, greedy for the smallest scrap of information.
Baixiao: The path to riches is actually quite simple. I've spent a lot of time by Lady Ningguang's side, and learned some... secrets, here and there.
Baixiao: How about this: Here are some nuggets of wisdom on the subject of "gold." It's my own personal guidance rather than Lady Ningguang's per se, but maybe it will still be able to bring fortune and prosperity your way.
