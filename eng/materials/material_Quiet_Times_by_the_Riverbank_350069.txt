# Quiet Times by the Riverbank

#A tranquil settlement that takes on the unique aesthetic of Vimara Village. Even if this furnishing set is not situated by a river or at the seaside, a whiff of the aroma of fish that wafts through this village will set the sound of water gurgling through your ears.
Vimara Village has a very different feeling from the Forest Ranger camp, for its inhabitants largely do not shoulder important duties and thus lead leisurely lives, making it a very nice place to be for those who wish to relax.
