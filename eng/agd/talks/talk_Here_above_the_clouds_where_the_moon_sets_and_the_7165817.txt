Zhongli: Here above the clouds, where the moon sets and the sun rises before your eyes, one's sense of time becomes indistinct.
Traveler: This is Cloud Retainer's place, right?
Zhongli: Indeed.
Zhongli: You have encountered her several times, correct?
Traveler: She is quite wondrous, even for an adeptus.
Zhongli: You possess a wealth of knowledge and experience, and you have goodness in your heart. Naturally, you are able to have friendly interactions with her.
Zhongli: Cloud Retainer is an expert in the mechanical arts, and an avid inventor.
Zhongli: Generous and kind, honest and forthright... I treasure her as both a friend and teacher, the likes of whom are hard to come by.
Zhongli: An old friend once said to me that if you ever have a question on the most trivial of affairs, two hours conversing with Cloud Retainer will leave you better informed than three days and nights talking to every soul in the harbor.
Zhongli: Traveler, would you say you agree?
Traveler: Hit the nail on the head.
Zhongli: Hahaha. Yes, Cloud Retainer does not waste words, but this is no bad thing. She may say that she prefers to keep her distance from the mortal realm, but in fact she cares deeply for humanity.
Zhongli: Ahh... I believe I have gazed at the mountains long enough. Time for a change of scenery.
Zhongli: Tomorrow... yes, perhaps I will head further north.
Zhongli: Qingce Village is one of the more populated places outside of the harbor. I think I shall go there.
Traveler: There's some truth to it.
