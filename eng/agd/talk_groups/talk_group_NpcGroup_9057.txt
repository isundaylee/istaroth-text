Traveler: Are you settling in okay?
Arataki Itto: Uh... is that a trick question? This is me we're talking about...
Arataki Itto: Send me anywhere in the world — anywhere at all — and I guarantee you I'd be able to live there.
Arataki Itto: I've slept on the streets, down at the dock, deep in the forest... Pretty much everywhere! Of course, comfort-wise, the cells at the Police Station are up there at the top of the list.
Arataki Itto: That was all before I met you, though.
Arataki Itto: This place is something else! In fact, I'm gonna go on the record and say that the comfort level here is like 10... No, what am I saying — 100 prison cells rolled into one!
Traveler: I don't want it to be like any number of prison cells!
Arataki Itto: Why not? They're great!
Arataki Itto: Anyway, look me in the eyes, and listen up, okay? This place is awesome!
Arataki Itto: Anyway... point made, boom. I'm not gonna drag it out like some... granny at a tea party.
Arataki Itto: But the code of the streets says I should find a way to express my, uh, you know, gratitude... but, I know... I—I can be your bouncer here!
Traveler: You flatter me!
Arataki Itto: Haha! Seriously though, I'm just telling it how it is. I think we're past the point where we need to be polite to each other all the time.
Arataki Itto: If it's okay with you, I might actually make this my main pad. It's a sweet deal, I'm pretty psyched at the idea of crashing here every night...

Traveler: Do you have time for a chat?
Arataki Itto: *sigh*... Argh... where do I start...
Traveler: What's happened?
Arataki Itto: I've been doing some thinking over the last couple of days about how I keep losing my Onikabuto fights, and, well... I'm starting to think that maybe I should just give it up now.
Arataki Itto: Maybe it's time to make a clean break, you know? To stop wasting my time on things which just don't matter.
Traveler: You mean you're...
Arataki Itto: You bet — I'm giving up Onikabuto fights for good! From this day forward, it's Fireflies all the way, baby!
Traveler: Maybe the issue isn't about the bugs...
Arataki Itto: Not about the bugs... like how? Are you saying I should go for a boar instead? Or a bird maybe? Nah... too much hard work!
Arataki Itto: You do you have a point though — swapping out one kind of bug for another won't necessarily improve my odds of winning...
Arataki Itto: Anyway, whatever. At the end of the day, I just haven't found the bug for me. Ugh, seems like you can't go looking for a strong companion, you've gotta wait for the right one to come along...
Arataki Itto: Luckily for me, you're not like them at all: You and I are like an absolute powerhouse together!
Traveler: ...Also, I'm not a bug!!!
Arataki Itto: Hahaha, right, there's that too! I was just kidding, of course. My mind never even went there.
Arataki Itto: If we ever got into a situation where a fight was unavoidable, naturally I'd be the one to take it for the team.
Arataki Itto: All you'd have to do is stand back and root for me. At the top of your voice, you know, really giving it all you've got. When it comes to the atmosphere, you've gotta go big or go home!
Arataki Itto: Haha... All we're missing now is a catchy chant...
Arataki Itto: Ummm... Okay, okay, I think I got something: "Arataki Itto, the strongest in his class! Meet him on the street-o, he'll make you kiss his feet-o!"
Arataki Itto: Sound good? Haha. Alright, let's practice it together now!
Traveler: Maybe it's to do with the people you're playing with...
Arataki Itto: The people? Nah! No way. Not possible!
Arataki Itto: The kids I battle with might talk a whole lot, and sure, there's a few pranksters among them — but they're no cheaters!

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Arataki Itto: Hey! Perfect timing. There's something I need to talk to you about. Something important. Has to be face to face.
Arataki Itto: So this, uh, Adventurers' Guild — what kind of things do they do? And which tasks do you normally take?
Traveler: You want to join the Adventurers' Guild?
Arataki Itto: Hah, me? No way!
Arataki Itto: You gotta be there, what, every other day? They seem to work you pretty hard, so...
Arataki Itto: I'mma put my boys on the case! Many hands make light work and all that, y'know...
Traveler: Oh right... You want to help me.
Arataki Itto: Wait, what do you mean, "oh right"!? C'mon, that's hurtful, where's the enthusiasm?
Arataki Itto: Next time, I don't wanna hear "oh right, Itto wants to help." I wanna hear "darn right, Itto wants to help"! Got it?
Arataki Itto: I see you as a member of the Arataki Gang! You do know that, don't you?
Arataki Itto: Every single member of my gang is like family to me. And, you know... same goes for you.
Arataki Itto: That makes this a family matter, you get it? Which means, leave it to Itto!
Arataki Itto: Don't you worry now, I've got your back wherever you go. Whether you're cruising the city or wandering the wilds, my boys will be there!
Arataki Itto: Ah, except... only in Inazuma. How am I supposed to protect you if you leave?
Arataki Itto: Hah! Guess it's time for the Arataki Gang to start expanding into other nations!
Traveler: Don't worry about me, I can look after myself!
Arataki Itto: Haha, that's the spirit! That's what makes you part of my crew.
Arataki Itto: Guess that settles it then. When I'm not around, promise me you'll carry on being a champ and living life to the max.
Arataki Itto: And when I say being a champ — that means kicking some serious butt, alright? I don't care if you're playing card games or you're brawling — no losing! Not to anyone!
Traveler: Thank you...
Arataki Itto: Ahem... I was hoping for more of a "sorry, I didn't ask you to help, Itto" than a "thank you"!
Arataki Itto: I know you've asked other people for help in the past, so why not me, huh? What's that about?

Traveler: Goodnight, Itto.
Arataki Itto: Wait... what? You're hitting the hay already?
Arataki Itto: Come on, sleep is for the weak! Not champions like you and I! You wanna play some Hide-and-Seek?
Arataki Itto: Playing at night takes it to a whole other level. Seriously, I'm preparing to go full oni on you here — so make sure you find a good hiding spot, capiche!?
