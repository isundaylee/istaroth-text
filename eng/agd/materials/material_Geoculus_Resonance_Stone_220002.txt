# Geoculus Resonance Stone

A stone that can be used in Liyue to search for nearby Geoculi.
This exquisite stone plate imitates a certain mysterious quality of the Geo Statues of The Seven, causing it to lead people to the location of Geoculi.
Elemental Oculi represent the lost power of the Statues of The Seven â€” perhaps offering this power back to the statues also has significance for the lands that the gods watch over.
