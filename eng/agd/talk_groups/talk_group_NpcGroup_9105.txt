## Talk

Ororon: Hello.
Ororon: Does time here pass the same way it does in the outside world? Not sure if I should be saying "good morning" or "good evening"...

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Ororon: Don't worry — I think it's great.
Ororon: I'm good at adapting to my environment. Teapot, water cup, wine barrel... I'd be fine in any container, really.
Traveler: Well, I'm very glad to hear that.
Ororon: And I'm very happy to be here. Thanks for having me.
Ororon: This place is so homey, and all the decor is so unique. I like everything about it.
Traveler: It's nothing special. I just went with the flow.
Ororon: I think that's a great way to live your life.
Ororon: It's the kind of mindset that makes it easier to move past things and overcome life's challenges.
Ororon: Besides, it's your home. Your own comfort should be your first priority.
Ororon: The best homes are spaces where you can sprawl out and live the way you want. Just like my place — I pretty much leave my stuff wherever I want.
Traveler: Then, make yourself at home!
Ororon: Okay! I basically already have.

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Ororon: If that's what you want, I'd be happy to.
Ororon: You're better off choosing the topic, though. I usually only talk about a few things.
Traveler: Like... growing vegetables?
Ororon: Exactly.
Ororon: Pretty amazing... It's like you know me already.
Traveler: Doesn't make you feel uncomfortable, does it?
Ororon: Oh, of course not.
Ororon: You're like a wild animal that seeks out human contact in a gentle way. No one's gonna turn that down.
Ororon: ...Sorry for comparing you to an animal. That came out wrong.
Ororon: What I meant to say is, you're friendly and approachable. You make it easy for people to let their guard down.
Ororon: Of course, I can tell your soul is more mature than your appearance suggests.
Ororon: There's a wealth of wisdom and experience behind your youthful appearance. If you were a fruit, you'd be... a tender one. The pick of the crop. Um...
Ororon: It's kind of hard to explain. All I'm trying to say is, I think you're great — the kind of person that everyone likes.
Traveler: It's the first time I've heard it put like that...
Ororon: Oh, did I say something weird?
Ororon: Sorry. That's kind of who I am.
Ororon: But, you don't seem to mind. So, I'll just keep being myself, okay?
Traveler: I'll take that as a compliment.
Ororon: You should! You're in a good place. Some people grow older without the "growing wiser" part.
Ororon: ...I hope I don't turn out like that.
Ororon: When you think about it... At least I can grow my own vegetables and hunt, so I'll never go hungry, right?

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Ororon: ...I can't think of anything. Is there anything you recommend?
Traveler: How about... something peaceful?
Ororon: In that case... maybe you'd like to try out Phlogiston Engraving?
Ororon: It sounds more serious than it is. Basically, it involves painting patterns which can be activated to generate different effects, using either Phlogiston or elemental energy.
Ororon: If we're not looking for a specific effect, we can make it even simpler by drawing random graffiti art and letting the rest happen naturally.
Ororon: For instance, drawing Paimon on the back of your hand might trigger extreme hunger for a little while.
Traveler: That checks out.
Ororon: It all comes down to the pattern itself and the formula of the paint.
Traveler: What about... something not peaceful at all?
Ororon: You mean some kind of sport or physical activity?
Ororon: We could race each other.
Traveler: ?
Traveler: And by that you mean... seeing who can run away the fastest?
Ororon: Never underestimate yourself.
Ororon: If you're not feeling confident enough, I can show you how to make graffiti smoke bombs. That way, it's a fair contest.
Traveler: I'd love that.
Ororon: Oh... You're right.
Ororon: This place feels so much like home, I almost forgot I'm still a guest. Sorry about that.
Ororon: In that case, we'll have to settle for a good, old fashioned race. Fine by me, though — it's exercise either way.
Traveler: Any other options?
Ororon: Sure. How about a combination of the two?
Ororon: In other words, doing graffiti while racing.
Traveler: Haha!
Ororon: Based on your reaction, you're hoping it was a joke, right?
Ororon: So, uh... Yeah. It was a joke.
Traveler: Thanks for chatting with me. It's been a lot of fun.
Ororon: Of course! And, anyway, I'm the one who should be thanking you.
Ororon: I don't get to visit friends' places very often, so I really appreciate you inviting me here.
Traveler: You're welcome! Feel free to stop by anytime.
Ororon: Thank you! Next time, I'll even bring along my prized radish — it's a big one.
Traveler: ...You're kidding, right?
Ororon: ...Yes?
Traveler: But sounds like a tough clean-up...
Traveler: I'd lose for sure.

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Ororon.
Ororon: Good morning. I'm only up this early because I haven't actually gone to sleep yet.
Ororon: So, go do your thing. I'll get some rest in a bit.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Ororon.
Ororon: Good night. You headed to bed?
Ororon: I feel pretty awake, actually. If this place wasn't so secure, I could help keep watch. Oh, well...
Ororon: Huh? Paimon can do that too? Then, the next time we get a chance, Paimon and I can keep watch together.

## Talk

Ororon: These furnishings take me right back to my childhood...
Ororon: Like these tall things, for instance. I remember finding it really hard to climb up to the top.
Ororon: And then once you grow up, you practically have to bend double to see the things down low more clearly... Heh, you grow up just to bend back down.

## Talk

Ororon: These plants are growing superbly. And you can tell they're in a great mood.
Ororon: You're really good at taking care of your friends.
Ororon: Of course, if you ever find they get upset, just let me know. I'll be more than happy to come cheer them up for you.
