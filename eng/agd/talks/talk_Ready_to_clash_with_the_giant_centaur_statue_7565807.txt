# Talk Dialog

Helka: Ready to clash with the giant centaur statue?
Traveler: I'll get prepping now.
Traveler: Let's talk a bit first...
Helka: This device was created by an ancient civilization, I believe. It appears like nothing so much as a musician on a stage. The society that created it must have been impressive indeed.
Helka: Katya said that Nod-Krai was also once home to an ordered and prosperous civilization, one that you can catch glimpses of from time to time.
Traveler: I'd like to know a bit about this "Nod-Krai"...
Helka: Well, about that... Nod-Krai is actually part of Snezhnaya, and once upon a time, they performed lots of large scale development in the area.
Helka: But you can't find hide nor hair of that nowadays â€” unless you're talking about the mechanical scrap you can see everywhere.
Helka: But maybe that's precisely why Nod-Krai's become the bustling place it is today.
Traveler: Give me a moment.
