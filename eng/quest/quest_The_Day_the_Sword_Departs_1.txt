# The Day the Sword Departs


## Talk 1

Sun Yu: Traveler, we meet again.
Traveler: Are you still training here?
Sun Yu: Indeed I am. It's just... so much harder than I expected. I don't know if I'm really that weak, or if I've adopted the wrong method...
Sun Yu: Anyway, enough about that. The last time when we fought monsters together, your moves turned out to be quite inspirational.
Sun Yu: Traveler, please do me a favor and accompany me for another round of training, will you?
Sun Yu: And just like the last time, monster fight or cross-country training? All up to you.
Traveler: Is Que'er still ignoring you?
Sun Yu: Well... She said she had things to do in the city recently, and she hasn't returned...
Sun Yu: I've paid her a couple of visits, but she just sends Zhiruo out to make me go away. She still refuses to see me.
Sun Yu: *sigh* I honestly don't know what to say to her now...

## Talk 2

Sun Yu: *huff* That was tough...
Sun Yu: I apologize. Look at me, making a fool of myself. I didn't expect that I would be so nervous when confronting real monsters...
Sun Yu: Needless to say, I still need more training. Anyway, thank you, Traveler. Please, take these as your reward.
Traveler: Are you really leaving?
Sun Yu: I haven't fully decided yet. I still need more time to think it through. Meanwhile, I'll see if I can convince Que'er to leave with me...

## Talk 3

Sun Yu: Traveler, we meet again.
Traveler: Are you still training here?
Sun Yu: Indeed I am. It's just... so much harder than I expected. I don't know if I'm really that weak, or if I've adopted the wrong method...
Sun Yu: Anyway, enough about that. The last time when we fought monsters together, your moves turned out to be quite inspirational.
Sun Yu: Traveler, please do me a favor and accompany me for another round of training, will you?
Traveler: You've trained here before?
Sun Yu: Thankfully, I met a helpful adventurer. She lent me a hand and, using a "mutually executable commission" as an excuse, she brought me in with her.
Sun Yu: She even helped me organize a training regimen and offered me all sorts of advice... But, at the same time, I have to help her deal with some commissions for the Adventurers' Guild.
Sun Yu: Ahem... Alright, let's get down to business, Traveler.
Sun Yu: Here's the thing. I've initiated a training plan for myself that includes fighting monsters and cross-country training.
Sun Yu: It's all up to you which one you'd like to help me focus on today, Traveler.
Traveler: Didn't know you could train in a place like this...
Sun Yu: I'm... a bit embarrassed to admit this, but I came here mainly because of the complex terrain and the roaming monsters. I thought it would be a great place to train. The only thing I didn't account for was how hard it was to get here...
Traveler: Is Que'er still ignoring you?
Sun Yu: Well... She said she had things to do in the city recently, and she hasn't returned...
Sun Yu: I've paid her a couple of visits, but she just sends Zhiruo out to make me go away. She still refuses to see me.
Sun Yu: *sigh* I honestly don't know what to say to her now...

## Talk 4

Traveler: Monster fight.
Sun Yu: Brilliant! I've long wanted to put the swordsmanship I learned into practice...
Traveler: I'm afraid you can't see my moves clearly.
Sun Yu: Y—You are really that skilled? Hahaha, well, then please do me another favor and slow down a bit.
Sun Yu: Let's see... There's one place where monsters gather right ahead. Let's go there first, shall we?

## Talk 5

Sun Yu: *huff* *huff* How... How could you... run so fast...
Traveler: You are a slow runner.
Sun Yu: I—I concede...
Sun Yu: *huff* Finally I get to catch my breath. Oh my, never thought it could be so exhausting...
Sun Yu: Thank you for the demonstration, Traveler. Please, take these as your reward.
Traveler: You still need more training.
Sun Yu: *huff* You are absolutely right...

## Talk 6

Traveler: Cross-country training.
Sun Yu: Brilliant! I've asked an adventurer to help me chart an off-road route... You know, it was only with her help that I was able to train here at all.
Sun Yu: She said I just need to reach the destination as quickly as possible. But it seems that I was never quick enough...
Sun Yu: So, can you demonstrate how to do it quickly? I'll try my best to keep up.
Traveler: No problem.
Sun Yu: Anyway, I'll be counting on you then. Let's head to the starting point, shall we?
Traveler: Try not to be left too far behind.
Sun Yu: I—I'll certainly try. But to be completely honest, I wasn't built a runner in any sense...

## Talk 7

Sun Yu: *huff* That was tough...
Sun Yu: Look at me, making a fool of myself again. I guess I haven't made much progress after all...
Sun Yu: Needless to say, I still need more training. Thank you, Traveler. Please, take these as your reward.
Traveler: How are you going to leave Liyue?
Sun Yu: Well... My current plan is to take the merchant's boat and travel by water.
Sun Yu: As for my first stop... I'm thinking about Fontaine. I'll probably stay there for a while and make further plans from there.
Sun Yu: *sigh* I wonder if I'll be able to convince Que'er to travel with me...

## Talk 8

Sun Yu: *huff* *huff* How... How could you... run so fast...
Traveler: You are a slow runner.
Sun Yu: I—I concede...
Sun Yu: Thank you for the demonstration, Traveler. Please, take these as your reward.
Traveler: About Que'er...
Sun Yu: *sigh* She still won't talk to me. I—I've run out of ideas...
Sun Yu: How did this become such a dilemma...
Traveler: About that adventurer...
Sun Yu: That adventurer? I met her at the Adventurers' Guild.
Sun Yu: She told me that she had accepted a commission from the Guild to work in The Chasm. When she heard that I wanted to come in here, she agreed to take me with her without much hesitation.
Sun Yu: But in exchange, I must help her with her commission. Mostly just to look for things though, nothing too toilsome.
Sun Yu: It's just... that she's crazily talkative. I had no idea how to deal with people like that...
Traveler: You still need more training.
Sun Yu: *huff* You are absolutely right...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Traveler: Cross-country training.
Sun Yu: Brilliant! Let's keep to the off-road trails we used before to train.
Sun Yu: The adventurer said that I just need to reach the destination as quickly as possible. But I've never quite been quick enough...
Sun Yu: Could you demonstrate how to do it quickly? I'll try my best to keep up.
Traveler: No problem.
Sun Yu: Anyway, I'll be counting on you then. Let's head to the starting point, shall we?
Traveler: Try not to be left too far behind.
Sun Yu: I—I'll certainly try. But to be completely honest, I wasn't built a runner in any sense...
