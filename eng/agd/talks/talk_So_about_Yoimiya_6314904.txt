Traveler: So, about Yoimiya...
Takami: Ms. Yoimiya is the current shop keeper at Naganohara Fireworks. Not only has she inherited the firework craftsmanship of Mr. Naganohara, she is also amazing at running the shop.
Takami: She also takes in people's wishes and makes brand-new custom fireworks for them. When it comes to pyrotechnics that can light up the entire night sky, Yoimiya's the only one you can call.
Takami: She even had The Crux Fleet from Liyue ship fireworks overseas just to fulfill my ridiculous wish of spreading Naganohara Fireworks across all of Teyvat.
Takami: I'm not sure how she made it happen, but I am genuinely grateful and have the utmost respect for her.
