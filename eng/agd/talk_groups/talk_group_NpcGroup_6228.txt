Traveler: Hello.
Mutota: Hello there. Welcome to the Flower-Feather Clan.
Mutota: As the chief, I don't want to seem too strict or lay too many rules down, but living here does take a little care and patience.
Mutota: The Qucusaurus is the proudest Saurian in Natlan, as are many of their riders.
Mutota: But once they're in battle, people soon discover that arrogance is no help in attaining victory.
Mutota: Scars may be a warrior's badge of honor, but they're also a reminder of mistakes made.
Mutota: ...I'm sorry. Have I been blabbing on too long? What I meant to say is: Please be extra careful.

Traveler: We meet again.
Mutota: Oh, it's you guys. Welcome. I trust that you're in good health, or are you suffering any aftereffects from the Abyss?
Mutota: Thank you so much for helping us when we were short-handed. If it weren't for you, our tribe would never have recovered so soon.
Mutota: Despite the threat of the Abyss having abated, there will always be danger lurking somewhere in this world.
Mutota: But you can't just rush in headfirst at any cost just because you're tough, okay? That's the easiest way for a warrior to make a mistake.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Mutota: Take care.

## Talk

Traveler: Thanks for the reminder.
Mutota: Don't mention it.
Mutota: Learning to fly takes guts, but you also need keen eyesight.
Mutota: Being blind to your surroundings is your biggest enemy while you're up in the air.
