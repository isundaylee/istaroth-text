Kurisu: Recently, there's been quite a few outlanders who have come to Ritou specifically to take part in the Irodori Festival. As such, it's up to us here in the International Trade Association to welcome them warmly.
Kurisu: From the moment we were notified that Ritou would be the festival site, which would be excellent for business, everyone's spirits really picked up.
Kurisu: Whether you may have goods to sell or if you'd just like to know more about the festival events, feel free to ask me.
Kurisu: So, is there anything I can help with? Do tell.

Traveler: About yourself...
Kurisu: I'm Kurisu from Fontaine. My real name is actually Christopher, but I've been here so long that it seemed suitable to change it to fit the local customs.
Kurisu: I'm currently in charge of the International Trade Association. My main task is to be the bridge between everyone here and the Shogunate officials.
Kurisu: We're all considered outlanders here regardless of where you are from, so we've got to take care of each other.
Kurisu: It's not an easy life abroad for folks like us. Hahaha...

Traveler: About the outlanders in Ritou...
Kurisu: Agh, I hardly even want to talk about it. It's just getting more and more difficult nowadays...
Kurisu: Not only have they limited our trading time and locations, they've also added tax items for various reasons. The biggest headaches are those bureaucrats from the Kanjou Commission.
Kurisu: Every now and then, they will come here and pick on us for whatever reason. It's just...
Kurisu: ...Ah, alas! Anyway, the merchant guild and I have dedicated ourselves to providing every outlander with support.

Traveler: About the outlanders in Ritou...
Kurisu: Since the head of the Hiiragi Clan was removed from his post, all the affairs of the Kanjou Commission have been well-regulated.
Kurisu: Taxes were reduced, and the officials and soldiers made things less difficult for the merchants. Everyone is really relieved.
Kurisu: However, there is still a lot to be done here. The source of goods, delivery routes and channels... There are still many things to settle.
Kurisu: Anyway, the Trade Association and I have dedicated ourselves to providing every outlander with support.

Traveler: That sounds painful.
Kurisu: Haha. There might be a few tricky problems here and there, but I get a boost of determination seeing everyone's smiling faces after the problem has been resolved.
