Traveler: Cutting fabric?
Elham: Yeah, I run a tailor shop that's well-liked by the locals.
Elham: Business has been good, but... I'm not satisfied with my tailoring skills.
Elham: My regular customers just praise the clothes I make all the time, and when I ask them if they have any suggestions for me, they all say that they don't have any.

Elham: That's why I've recently been considering going to Fontaine for further training. I've heard that there are some very good couture stores.
