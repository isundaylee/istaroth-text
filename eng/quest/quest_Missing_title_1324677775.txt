# Missing title (1324677775)

Titu: I can't believe that worked. That was truly a scene from out of story and song.
Titu: The cacophony fell silent... and the Pin returned to its original state. Then, its giant form crashed to the ground...
Titu: Hoo... To think that someone could really accomplish this... This isn't a dream, is it? You're all real, aren't you? Not figments of my imagination?
Traveler: Wake up, wake up... You've got to fix this yourself!
Paimon: Hey, there's no need to be so mean.
Paimon: #But anyway, didn't Paimon tell you? {NICKNAME}'s super strong!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: #Hehe, you think so, don'cha, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}?
Titu: #You weren't affected by the Abyss, were you, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: Relax, it's just the Abyss...
Titu: #Even our strongest warriors must remain vigilant and then some in the face of the Abyss. You're no ordinary person, {NICKNAME}.
Titu: Haha, who knows, the story I spin from this material might even surpass those by Sanhaj!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Ehrrr?
Paimon: Well, that sure sounds impressive, but who's Sanhaj?
Titu: Haha, for "those who tell stories in their tribes," Sanhaj of the Masters of the Night-Wind is worthy of reverence indeed...
Titu: Alas, time is short. I'll tell you more about Sanhaj when we've got more time!
Titu: Alright then. Let's head for the next floating Shadow Pin. I want to fix this issue and start writing by nightfall!
Paimon: Woohoo! Let's go, let's go!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: I'm alright for now.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Titu: Wow. Here I'd thought to come over and check on the frightening noises I'd heard...
Titu: Telling myself "Come on, Titu, it's probably nothing"... But this is quite something! Quite something indeed!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Titu: There's even a little Tepetlisaurus here... Was it you who brought these outlanders here, then?
Titu: And... was it you who brought this Shadow Pin down?
Traveler: ...Should we not have done that?
Paimon: #Eh? Wait, did we do something bad, {NICKNAME}? If we act fast, while there's only one witness...
Titu: #Haha, come on, no need for that! It's not serious, and if anything, I'd say you've done us a favor! So, you're {NICKNAME}, then? Who's your friend over there?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: #And this is {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}.
Titu: And Titu's my name, a teller {RUBY#[D]storyteller}of tales for our tribe. I'm also responsible for "caring" for the stone pillars in this valley.
Titu: And of course, this Shadow Pin you've plunged into the earth is one of three little pins, and its care is within my jurisdiction.
Paimon: J—Jurisdiction... Uh oh, looks like we're going to have to compensate the locals for dropping that stone pillar.
Paimon: Ugh, Paimon wouldn't have used our real name's if she'd known sooner.
Titu: Compensate... "Titu had a flash of inspiration. Perhaps he might use this to coerce these people into helping him achieve his goals..."
Titu: That's how I'd slot a bit like this into the plot, anyway.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Hmm?
Titu: Ah, sorry, got a bit carried away thinking about stories there. Telling{RUBY#[D]storyteller} tales is my responsibility here in the tribe, and after so many years, it's time for me to come up with some originals.
Titu: And of course, something just had to go wrong with the Shadow Pin just as I was a few days into my musing... Because why would it ever rain when it could pour?
Titu: Ahem! Anyway, I'm not gonna blackmail you. I—I mean, I wouldn't have spoken my thoughts aloud if that was the case, right?
Titu: Look, we exchanged names, but we haven't come to blows, so that makes us friends, yes?
Titu: In that case... could you listen to a friend's request?
Traveler: Sure... as long as it doesn't involve compensation.
Titu: No, no, surely not! Hmm, how should I put this? ... When you passed through the valley, did you see some sort of giant block of solid phlogiston with golden patterns carved into it?
Titu: It's in the center of this place. You can't miss it.
Traveler: That rings a bell...
Titu: This whole business I'm talking about has to do with that huge stone pillar. We call it a Shadow Pin... and we've had problems with it recently.
Titu: To be honest, I'd all but given up before meeting you. I had the line all ready: "The Shadow Pins could not be saved, dooming the tribe to calamitous destruction"... It didn't sound too bad.
Paimon: Wait, it's just a stone pillar. How could it destroy the tribe?
Paimon: Also, what's so special about these "Shadow Pins" anyway? And the one we dropped, it was a... lesser pin? But it seemed pretty big to Paimon, so why's it called that?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Hmm?
Titu: Hmm... Since you're both outlanders, I suppose a more detailed explanation is in order. This is related to a legend handed down through our tribe.
Titu: The stories say that the Wayob hung the Pins here to seal the shadow of the Volcano Lord...
Titu: But that which is sealed beneath them is, in truth, the Abyss.
Titu: That's how most tales in Natlan are. They're embellished narratives held up as warnings, and all their rhetoric is a kind of metaphor.
Paimon: Wait, so you mean the Abyss is actually sealed below here!?
Titu: That's right. And recently, two out of the three little Shadow Pins have floated upward. Perhaps if the third floats too, all the evil beneath the earth will come surging up like a tide.
Titu: So to be honest, it's an unexpected boon that you've managed to push one back in. So, no compensation required.
Titu: If anything, I was hoping to ask if you'd mind pushing the other one back in as well...
Paimon: #Huh... What do you think, {NICKNAME}...?
Traveler: ...Where the Abyss is involved, we can't stand idle.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: #Even you're up for it, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}? Well, alright then.
Titu: Ah, like a flame that appears in the darkness, so too will heroes rise up in times of great peril. Human possibility shines through in glory at moments such as this.
Titu: #You know what? This could make for a great story, too — indeed, {NICKNAME}, you've got some traits that even those storied heroes don't have. I'm looking forward to this, I must say.
Titu: Let's go, then, dear heroes. Let's go and check on the last floating Pin...
Traveler: Perhaps I could lend a hand?
Traveler: Nope, don't recall anything like that...
Titu: Huh. I thought it was obvious enough. That's fine, though.
Traveler: Paimon did it. I was just walking over here...
Paimon: Hey! You're always like that! Paimon'll get mad if you don't cut it out!
Titu: #Haha, relax. If anything, this is a huge relief. So your name's Paimon, then? In that case, how about this {M#good fellow}{F#good lady} over here?
Traveler: #Call me {NICKNAME}.
