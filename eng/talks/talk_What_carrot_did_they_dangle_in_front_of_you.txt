Traveler: What carrot did they dangle in front of you?
Edwin Eastinghouse: Mora, fame, mansions, the whole nine yards. But I'm not interested in any of that.
Edwin Eastinghouse: Mora won't necessarily buy you any raw Arkhium, and fame won't attract top research assistants.
Edwin Eastinghouse: As for the mansions... maybe I'd consider it if they were filled with precision instruments, but that clearly wouldn't be the case.
Edwin Eastinghouse: I had no place to restart my research at the time, so I had to agree to rebuild the lab there.
Edwin Eastinghouse: And now, thanks to Nacker, I don't even have my lab anymore!
