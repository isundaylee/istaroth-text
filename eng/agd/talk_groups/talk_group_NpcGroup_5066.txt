## Talk

Areta: A little sun's good for your health.

## Talk

Traveler: And you are...
Areta: I'm a doctor — the legitimate kind. I've got the relevant certification, and a graduation cert from the Akademiya to boot.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Areta: See you. May you remain in good health.

## Talk

Traveler: Why are you practicing medicine here?
Areta: I used to be very poor, and I had no money to support my studies or travel overseas. It was the Spina di Rosula that sponsored me.
Areta: Of course, they did so on the condition that I consider returning here to work as a doctor after finishing my studies. I'd be salaried as is standard, of course — with the Spina being my employer.
Areta: I thought it was a good deal, and I understood what they wanted out of it. So I only ask for the most basic fees when I practice here.

## Talk

Traveler: You're needed here.
Areta: No, sunshine is needed here.
Areta: But the people in Fleuve Cendre have already gotten used to such a lifestyle. We don't go up there unless it is absolutely necessary.
Areta: *sigh* Enough about that. Same goes for you. Stay in the sunlight more often and eat more vegetables and fruits. It's good for your health.
