# Those Hard-to-Reach Places


## Talk 1

Aramis: Oh, what am I to do...
Traveler: Do you need help with anything?
Aramis: Whenever the Windblume Festival rolls along, people will always offer up all manner of flowers to the Archon statue. Then a gust of wind comes, and off they go, flying every which way.
Aramis: We've had to spend no small amount of effort to clear these withered flowers out. But while I can handle the flowers and leaves in the plaza itself, there's not much I can do about the ones that get onto roofs and the city walls.
Aramis: Definitely not with these knees of mine. They really aren't holding up well...
Traveler: I'll lend you a hand.
Aramis: You would? Oh, that's wonderful. Those withered flowers are pretty obvious. You should be able to see them the moment you get on top of a roof.

## Talk 2

Aramis: *sigh* More steps here, and a couple of roofs there, up and down, up and down... I don't know how long my knees will last at this rate...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Huh, guess there really was a cat. Wonder why it's over here...
Lost Cat: Meow... Meeeow...
Traveler: Meow, meow, meow?
Lost Cat: Meow-meow!
Paimon: Um, hate to break it to you, but Paimon doesn't think it understands a thing you just said...
Paimon: Let's get it down from here first. Maybe Aramis knows who it belongs to.
Traveler: Are you lost?

## Talk 4

Aramis: I'm sorry, I don't think I've seen it. If I did, I'm sure I would have had some impression.
Margaret: Oh, I see... That little darling really loves flowers. I thought that she might have chased them here.
Traveler: Someone looking for a cat?
Lost Cat: Meow... Meow!
Margaret: Is that... Butterfly? Oh, it really is you! Where have you been?
Traveler: On the city walls.
Margaret: So it's just as I thought, then... Thank you so much. Butterfly here loves to chase flowers. She's been a real headache during this time, what with there being flowers all over the city and all.
Margaret: Thank you once again — your next drink's on me the next time you visit The Cat's Tail. Well, the non-alcoholic ones, at least.
Traveler: Oh, joy, this again...
Margaret: Haha... Once again, thank you. See you around, and happy Windblume Festival.
Aramis: Well, I never — so cats are attracted to the flowers too. What a busy festival... Still, it's good that you found that cat.
Aramis: If you'd asked me to climb up there to rescue it, I'm afraid my knees would have given up the ghost...
Aramis: Well then, thank you for your trouble. Here's a little something for your work.
Traveler: Let's save that tab for next time, I suppose.
