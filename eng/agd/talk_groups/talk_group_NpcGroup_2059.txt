# Talk Group: NpcGroup - 2059

## Talk

Vlad: The Lantern Rite fireworks are ever so beautiful. I'd love to watch them again with her before the boat arrives...
Vlad: Uh, sorry. Were you talking to me?
Vlad: Sorry, it's been a while since someone has spoken to me, you literally caught me off guard.
Vlad: But... I don't really wish to actively socialize with the people here.

## Talk

Vlad: Hmm? Are you talking to me?
Vlad: Sorry, it's been a while since someone has spoken to me, you literally caught me off guard.
Vlad: But... I don't really wish to actively socialize with the people here.

## Talk

Vlad: Who are you?
Vlad: I am the guard here.
Vlad: This is the Northland Bank, which was opened in Liyue by Snezhnaya. It's also the only non-local bank here in Liyue.
Vlad: That's about all I know. If you would like to know more, you could talk to the manager.

## Talk

Vlad: You don't want to socialize with others?
Vlad: Well, I did try to fit in at first, but eventually I realized it was no use and just gave up.
Vlad: Even though I've met a lot of people here, in the end, I couldn't help but still feel a certain distance between myself and them. I was never included as a part of the group.
Vlad: And socializing with them is exhausting. At this point, I've lost all interest in trying...
Vlad: Perhaps there are just too many cultural differences.

## Talk

Vlad: Goodbye.
Vlad: If you don't have any urgent matters, then you best be on your way. Idle chatter is not part of my duties here.

## Talk

Vlad: Hmm? Are you talking to me?
Vlad: Sorry, I was just reminiscing about my hometown.

## Talk

Vlad: What are you doing?
Vlad: I'm waiting for a boat, a boat that will come at an unknown time, a boat that will take me home.
Vlad: My name is Vlad. I was transferred from my home country of Snezhnaya to come work here in Liyue.
Vlad: I've already been in this city for some time now, but clearly it's impossible for me to fit in here. So I've sent an application to headquarters to be transferred back home, but I don't know when the boat will arrive.
Vlad: Even though I live here, I don't interact at all with the people of this city, except for just one person.
Vlad: Tell me about that person.
Vlad: She's also a guard at the Northland Bank like me, except I have the day shift, and she has the night shift.
Vlad: It's as if I'm the sun, and she's the moon. Even though we're aware of one another's existence, our paths will never meet. I guess that's just how it's meant to be.
Vlad: Then one day out of the blue, she left a letter for me right where we change the guard. We've been writing each other as pen pals ever since.
Vlad: Although I can't wait for the boat to arrive, reading her letters is the only thing that makes my heart feel at ease.

## Talk

Vlad: Goodbye.
Vlad: Goodbye. May the comfort of home never leave your side.
