Traveler: About the art of making kites...
Zhenyuan: Ah, guess I haven't told you all that much about my aunt, Granny Shan, have I?
Zhenyuan: Everyone in my family can at least sorta make kites, but she's the best at it by far. You could even call her love for making 'em an "obsession" of sorts.
Zhenyuan: How her eyes would sparkle when she taught me the traditional lantern patterns! I listened and studied hard... but I couldn't tell you if I'd ever catch up with her.
Zhenyuan: Hehe... Now, she might look old, but you should see the smile on her face when she's working with those kites!
Zhenyuan: If my kids are willing, I'd love to hand this craft down to them, too...
