Farabi: The Snowboar that has been extinct for over a hundred years has reappeared, and they've left their original cold habitat in Dragonspine to live in warmer forests...
Farabi: This is intriguing. Has something changed in the ecology of Teyvat recently? Hmm, I must study this closely.
Farabi: I've been to Mondstadt before, but only to drown my sorrows. Thanks to your help, I'm back on my feet!
Farabi: I will do what I can to speed my investigations up while you guys look for traces of Snowboars.
