# Should You Be Trapped in a Windless Land


## Talk 1

Diluc: You know, I'm glad I actually had the chance to come down here today.
Diluc: The tavern isn't overcrowded, and I couldn't be in a better mood.

## Talk 2

Diluc: Stanley...
Diluc: So many years after the fact, it's not even his friend himself that holds him back anymore.
Diluc: But I for one am confident that the people of Mondstadt will not forget his friend's story.

## Talk 3

Stanley: Tell me, Stanley... Tell me what should I do...?
Paimon: Huh? Why does he keep repeating his own name?
Traveler: He's hiding something.
Paimon: Could there be another person called Stanley?
Stanley: *sobs* Oh, Stanley...
Stanley: It should have been me! I should have been the one to die in the Mare Jivari that day... Why won't your spirit come and stop me from using your name? Why, Stanley, why?
Stanley: If only you hadn't had to save a rookie like me, you would have never died in that windless corner of the world...
Stanley: You were a renowned adventurer, destined to become a legend one day... But now... that'll never happen, because your life was cut short— and all because of a worthless tag-along...
Paimon: Uhh... Does anyone get what's going on here?
Venti: ...I think our friend really did make it to the Mare Jivari. And I think the tragedy he encountered there was real, too.
Venti: But the real adventurer, the real Stanley — that was his partner. Not him.
Venti: The real Stanley is the one who died to save our "Stanley."
Paimon: Wait... So the only reason our Stanley is called Stanley in the first place is because he stole the other Stanley's name?
Venti: I fear that may be the case.
Stanley: Stanley, for so many years I've lived in fear... fear that Mondstadt will forget all about you... So I tell your adventure stories at every opportunity...
Stanley: Mondstadt must remember: Stanley reached the center of the Mare Jivari... He's the greatest adventurer there ever was, and he lives on!
Stanley: Stanley will never die, because... I am Stanley! I... am Stanley...
Stanley: I'm sorry, Stanley... I'm getting too old... now...
Stanley: *sigh* ...
Stanley: Are you guys planning on eavesdropping much longer?
Paimon: Yikes! We're busted!
Traveler: There's another Stanley.
Venti: Surely not. Even I've never heard tell of a second Stanley.

## Talk 4

Stanley: *sigh* Go away. Save your questions, just... leave me in peace.
Paimon: But...
Stanley: Leave, now! Don't make me tell you again!
Jack: Honorary Knight! Venti! And Paimon! I'm so glad you guys are here.
Jack: I've been looking for you everywhere! I wanted to thank you again for helping me find the sword and shield. My parents are finally supporting me!
Venti: Oh... Really?
Jack: Yeah, really! They even said they're gonna pay for someone to fix up the Sword of Brilliant Valor and Shield of Magnificent Honor for me, so I can take them out on the road.
Venti: That's wonderful! So, Jack, is this the part where you bid farewell to Mondstadt and set off on your intrepid trip traversing Teyvat?
Jack: No, not yet. I still don't have what it takes to go too far from home just yet.
Jack: Besides, I'm sure Stanley still has a few stories left to tell. Hehe... They're what inspired me to become an adventurer in the first place.
Jack: Stanley, I— Oh, you're drunk again...
Jack: See you tomorrow, then. After your hangover wears off, maybe you can tell me some more of your stories?
Venti: Stanley's really fond of that kid, don't you think?
Stanley: *hic* Jack? Jack!
Venti: Jack left.
Stanley: Oh, I see... Well, thank you for not telling him about my secret.
Venti: Eh? All of a sudden you're facing the facts? That isn't like you...
Stanley: Just now... I couldn't bear to look at him. His adventurer's spirit is so pure... unblemished...
Stanley: I'm just a weary old feckless fraud, but that kid is a brand-new shining star, full of potential... I cannot allow his dreams to be crushed.
Paimon: You're not a total fraud... Stanley's adventure stories and experiences — they're all true, aren't they?
Stanley: Stories... Experiences... What's the point of them anymore?
Stanley: To be honest, my memories of adventuring, and of Stanley... they're hazy these days.
Stanley: That's my biggest secret of all. And my biggest fear.
Stanley: All these years, I've been livin' to tell his story. But his personality, and the details of his life, I don't remember them clearly anymore. Ah-ha...
Traveler: His whole life, he's been drowning in guilt...
Traveler: All that remains is this imaginary friend...
Stanley: But the one thing I can never forget... is that he died in a windless land, where his spirit can never be recovered!
Venti: Exactly... Even in his memory, the real Stanley isn't the living, breathing friend he knew at all.
Venti: Instead, he's become fixed on the image of him as that battle-scarred warrior... and that image has held him captive his entire life.
Stanley: I'm too old... I never let go, but still so much has slipped away...
Stanley: I'm completely and utterly worthless!
Stanley: No adventurer should have to go that way... No adventurer ever...
Stanley: I... I can't believe it...
Stanley: Thank you all! And thank you, Lord Barbatos...
Stanley: I'm sorry, it's gonna take me some time to calm back down...
Stanley: But, I think that... I'm gonna be okay...
Venti: Ah, wonderful! Stanley reconnected with his true self, and Jack can finally go his own way.
Venti: This calls for a celebration! And by celebration, I do of course mean libation!
Paimon: And by libation, you mean you're not leaving this tavern till you're too drunk to walk, right?
Venti: Haha... no. The wine here's too expensive. Jack still owes me some wine though — he promised me a rare vintage in exchange for helping him out, remember?
Venti: I'll head off to fetch the wine. See you shortly! Let's meet at the *usual place*.
Traveler: It's anybody's guess.
Traveler: I think I know where... possibly.
Traveler: Okay, see you there!
Paimon: Huh? Where's that supposed to be? Why has Paimon never heard of it? Hey, Tone-Deaf Bard!
Paimon: Hey!

## Talk 5

Venti: You made it... finally.
Paimon: Just tell us where you mean next time, okay!? We looked everywhere!
Paimon: Hmph... So. Did you at least manage to find your wine?
Venti: Yep! Well, sort of... Jack made it out to be a rare, collectors' edition vintage...
Venti: ...when actually, it's just a half bottle of regular cider.
Venti: Ah, this takes me back.
Venti: The first time I saw this view, I hadn't even taken on this form yet.
Traveler: ...What?
Venti: It was about twenty-six hundred years ago, before the world had come under the rule of The Seven.
Venti: At that time, Old Mondstadt was ruled by a tyrant, who sealed off the city's perimeter with a ferocious hurricane. Even the birds couldn't get in or out.
Paimon: Old Mondstadt? Oh, Paimon remembers — nowadays it's known as Stormterror's Lair, right? You mentioned it before!
Venti: That's right. The tyrant of the winds who once ruled from that tower was Decarabian, God of Storms.
Venti: Back then, I was but a wisp among the thousand winds. I wasn't a god of anything — I didn't even have a human form...
Venti: I was just a tiny elemental being who lived in the wind, a gentle breeze bringing subtle changes for the better, or tiny seeds of hope.
Paimon: A tiny elemental being? Without a human form? Venti... do you mean you used to look different than you do now?
Venti: Yep. My current form is not so different from the situation with fake Stanley... I took the form of a friend.
Paimon: So then what?
Paimon: What happened to your friend?
Traveler: (Same situation as with Stanley's friend...)
Venti: Say, Paimon, do you wish to hear the next part of the story?
Paimon: Yes, of course! The suspense is killing Paimon!
Traveler: Paimon, go pick us a couple of apples.
Paimon: Now's the time you suddenly get a craving for apples? Really?
Venti: Hahaha, getting a little... peckish or something...
Traveler: Oh, so peckish.
Paimon: Huh! Paimon's had it up to here with you!
Venti: Ah... You know, you're so smart it almost makes me uncomfortable sometimes...
Venti: But then, maybe it's right that true friends can tell what the other is thinking.
Venti: A refreshing drink, a gentle breeze... *sigh* Moments like this always take me back...
Venti: Back to a song that I first heard from him...
Traveler: I'm listening.
Traveler: Paimon, could you fetch us some meat or fish?
Paimon: But Venti's telling his story! What makes you suddenly wanna have a meat feast!?
