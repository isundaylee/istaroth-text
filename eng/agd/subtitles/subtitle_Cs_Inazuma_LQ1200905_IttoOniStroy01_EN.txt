A long, long time ago, in a village lost to time
There lived a crimson oni and a blue oni. They were the best of friends
The crimson oni looked fierce, but was gentle like the humans
The blue oni looked human, but was reclusive like an oni
The crimson oni wished to befriend the humans, but they were scared
And threw beans at him whenever he came near
So the blue oni said to the crimson oni:
"Aka, I'll cause trouble in the village, you come and stop me"
"Then the humans will accept you"
As planned, the crimson oni chased the blue oni away
The crimson oni's deeds spread throughout the land
And people finally accepted him
But when the crimson oni went to tell the blue oni the good news
He was gone, and left only a letter behind:
"I went traveling. Don't come find me, or they'll treat you as a naughty little oni"
"But don't worry about me. No matter where I go..."
"We'll always be friends"
