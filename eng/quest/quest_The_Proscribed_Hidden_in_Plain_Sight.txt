# The Proscribed, Hidden in Plain Sight


## Talk 1

Traveler: Let's spend some coupons to skip work. (-400 Credit Coupons)
Traveler: (I don't think there are any more clues to be found here. Perhaps we should work at the Production Zone more often to see if we can discover anything unexpected...)

## Talk 2

Traveler: Let's spend some coupons to skip work. (-400 Credit Coupons)
Paimon: Though it feels nice to slack off a little, less work means less coupons... Let's make the most of our morning!

## Talk 3

Traveler: It's time for a rest.
Paimon: Alright... By the way, it seems like we still haven't found all the clues regarding the strange meal box.
Paimon: Paimon hopes tomorrow's food will be a little more normal...

## Talk 4

Paimon: Ah, the dawn of a new day! Paimon feels like we're getting used to life as convicts. Uh, is that a good thing or a bad thing?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon doesn't want to get up... Paimon still feels completely exhausted from yesterday...
Paimon: Maybe we can make some progress in our investigation today.
Paimon: What do you have planned for us?

## Talk 5

Traveler: Let's go work in the production zone.
Paimon: After working here so long, we're really starting to get the hang of it.
Paimon: #But doing the same thing all the time can get old pretty quickly. How are you holding up, {NICKNAME}?

## Talk 6

Traveler: Let's see if there's any really easy work...
Paimon: Yeah, it's good to kick back and relax once in a while.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Ah, the dawn of a new day! Paimon feels like we're getting used to life as convicts. Uh, is that a good thing or a bad thing?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon doesn't want to get up... Paimon still feels completely exhausted from yesterday...
Paimon: Maybe we can make some progress in our investigation today.
Paimon: What do you have planned for us?

## Talk 8

Traveler: It's not time yet.
Paimon: Oh, okay then...

## Talk 9

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_BLACK_SCREEN): After persuading Collins to lower the difficulty, you easily clear the challenge.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_BLACK_SCREEN): Collins lowers the difficulty and you cruise through the game, but you receive fewer coupons.

## Talk 10

Paimon: Ah, the dawn of a new day! Paimon feels like we're getting used to life as convicts. Uh, is that a good thing or a bad thing?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon doesn't want to get up... Paimon still feels completely exhausted from yesterday...
Paimon: Maybe we can make some progress in our investigation today.
Paimon: What do you have planned for us?

## Talk 11

Paimon: Ah, the dawn of a new day! Paimon feels like we're getting used to life as convicts. Uh, is that a good thing or a bad thing?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon doesn't want to get up... Paimon still feels completely exhausted from yesterday...
Paimon: Maybe we can make some progress in our investigation today.
Paimon: What do you have planned for us?

## Talk 12

Traveler: Let's spend some coupons to skip work. (-400 Credit Coupons)
Paimon: We don't have enough coupons to skip work, let's go earn some more before trying to take any time off.

## Talk 13

Paimon: #*stretching* Are you awake, {NICKNAME}?
Paimon: Hmm? What's wrong? You seem to have something on your mind... Did you dream about something last night?
Traveler: I dreamed of Childe...
Paimon: Is that even possible? Unless... It wasn't an ordinary dream?
Paimon: Ah.... Childe's Vision! So you had it with you this whole time...
Paimon: Maybe the Vision connected Childe's consciousness to yours?
Traveler: Maybe I can use his Vision...
Paimon: And our investigation has its first major breakthrough! Good thing you brought the Vision with you here.
Paimon: So what did you see in the dream? Do you know where Childe went?
Traveler: The dream was a little hazy...
Paimon: Huh, okay... Well, hopefully it'll be a bit more helpful in the future.
Paimon: What's more important now is that it's the start of another new day as prisoners. Let's do our best to earn more Credit Coupons!
Paimon: What's the plan for today?
Traveler: Let's go work in the production zone.
Paimon: Let's go, it's time to start working. If that guard Fielding catches us skulking about, he's sure to give us an earful.
Traveler: Let's spend some coupons to skip work.
Paimon: Huh? You want to spend our coupons on slacking off already? We'd better go to work and earn some more coupons first. We'll have more room to relax once we've got some spare coupons to fall back on!
Traveler: And I didn't see anything particularly useful.
Traveler: To see everything he experienced from his perspective.
Traveler: Rather, in the dream, I was Childe...

## Talk 14

Fielding: Hey, Traveler, Paimon! Package here for ya.
Fielding: The next time you buy something, go pick it up yourself. I'm not a deliveryman, you know.
Paimon: #Huh? A package... For us? Did you buy something, {NICKNAME}? *yawn* Paimon's not quite awake yet, so why don't you go take a look...
Traveler: I didn't buy anything.
Paimon: Ah, right! Yesterday we broke the "hidden rule" and bought tickets for both boxers. Maybe this package is the "bad thing" that Collins said would happen...
Paimon: Uh, Paimon suddenly feels wide awake! Wait, maybe let Paimon go hide somewhere first. Just call for Paimon AFTER you've opened it!
Paimon: Hey, wait, wait! Paimon's still here, don't open it! Ahh!
Traveler: Doesn't seem especially scary.
Paimon: Huh? What is it? Are you okay?
Paimon: L—Let Paimon take a peek too...
Paimon: Oh, it's just a small bottle... but the color of the liquid inside looks so wrong, almost like...
Traveler: Hmm, rumor has it that a boxer went missing...
Paimon: Alright, that's enough of that! No need to say it out loud, Paimon already knows what you're trying to say...
Traveler: Do you want to give it a sniff?
Paimon: Blegh, no way! Get that stuff away from Paimon!
Traveler: Seems we'll have to investigate.
Paimon: Paimon thinks we shouldn't open the bottle until we've figured out what's going on. Just trust Paimon on this one, okay!?
Paimon: What do you plan on doing now?
Traveler: This place is chock-full of strange happenings after all...
Traveler: Do you want to give it a taste?
Traveler: And the liquid in the bottle obviously looks like blood...
Traveler: But there is something a little odd inside.
Traveler: Unless, this is...

## Talk 15

Paimon: *sigh* Looks like we won't get a chance to sleep in as long as we're here. Let's get to bed early.
Paimon: *yawn* We woke up so early today that Paimon's been nodding off all afternoon... Good thing it's finally time for bed.
Paimon: Seems we had a productive day. Hope we can make even more progress tomorrow!

## Talk 16

Traveler: Let's spend some coupons to skip work. (-400 Credit Coupons)
Paimon: We don't have enough coupons to skip work, let's go earn some more before trying to take any time off.

## Talk 17

Traveler: Let's end the shift.
Paimon: Alright... By the way, it seems like we still haven't found all the clues regarding the strange liquid.
Paimon: No more strange packages are gonna show up... right?

## Talk 18

Paimon: Whoa! Isn't this the super lucky meal!? Looks like hard work really does get rewarded!
Paimon: Paimon's going to take her time and savor every bite!
Paimon: Oh... Just a regular meal set. Guess Paimon shouldn't get her hopes up...
Paimon: #Wh—What is this garbage!? Ugh, it looks disgusting... Aw, Paimon misses your cooking now, {NICKNAME}...
Paimon: What would you like to do this afternoon?

## Talk 19

Vidoc: Well? Have you gotten used to prison life yet?
Vidoc: Shh... Save the questions for now. I don't like to give away information for no reason, you know.

## Talk 20

Traveler: Let's end the shift.
Paimon: Alright... By the way, it seems like we haven't found all the clues regarding the strange meal box.
Paimon: Paimon just hopes to get some normal food today.

## Talk 21

Traveler: I'm no quitter.
Paimon: #Wow, giving it your all even when it's just a game. That's {NICKNAME} for ya!

## Talk 22

Paimon: Whoa! Isn't this the super lucky meal!? Looks like hard work really does get rewarded!
Paimon: Paimon's going to take her time and savor every bite!
Paimon: Oh... Just a regular meal set. Guess Paimon shouldn't get her hopes up...
Paimon: #Wh—What is this garbage!? Ugh, it looks disgusting... Aw, Paimon misses your cooking now, {NICKNAME}...
Paimon: What would you like to do this afternoon?

## Talk 23

Collins: #Oh? You must be {NICKNAME}, huh? Sorry, mate, but competitors as strong as you are prohibited from participating. I don't make the rules, mind you, but I was given very specific instructions...
Collins: Even convicts value their lives, don't they? I hope you can understand, haha...
Collins: But we have a game here that'll let you show off your strength, and you'll even earn some Credit Coupons in the process. What do you think? Interested?
Paimon: And if we lose the game? Will it cost us Credit Coupons?
Collins: Of course! That's the cruel reality facing every competitor in a place like the Pankration Ring.
Traveler: Alright, I'll give it a try.
Collins: OK. Great, let me walk you through the rules.
Collins: The targets in front of you will pop up one after another.
Collins: You'll need to hit the targets in the same order that they popped up. If you can complete a few rounds in a row with no mistakes, then you'll win Credit Coupons.
Collins: But the second you mess up the order, you lose. Game over.
Collins: The game costs 300 Credit Coupons to have a go. So, you up for it?
Traveler: I don't have enough coupons...
Collins: Then come back once you've got enough coupons, I'll still be here to start the game for ya.

## Talk 24

Grainville: Let me have a look... Hmm, not bad. Right, here's your Credit Coupons.

## Talk 25

Paimon: Huh? Rowan? What are you doing here, Chief?
Rowan: Oh, uh... I was injured a bit just now. Nothing major, I think I just pulled something. Little mishaps like this are unavoidable at work, y'know...
Paimon: Huh, Paimon wouldn't have thought someone as experienced as the Chief would still get hurt on the job...
Rowan: Tch, I just knew you would say that... This is pretty embarrassing... *sigh* Ugh, where is Sigewinne when you need her anyway? The one time I need to make a quick trip to the infirmary...
Paimon: Oh? You mean she wasn't in the infirmary?
Rowan: Yeah, the rumors say that there's never anybody in the infirmary in the half hour before lunch, and nobody knows where Sigewinne gets off to.
Traveler: So this isn't just a coincidence...
Traveler: But she's always absent during lunch?
Paimon: Huh, that's actually really strange. Sigewinne's always super dedicated to her work, where else would she possibly go...?
Rowan: *sigh* Forget it, I can take care of a small sprain like this on my own anyway, no need to trouble her.

## Talk 26

Paimon: Sigewinne? Aren't you supposed to be in the infirmary? What are you doing in the production zone?
Sigewinne: #Hello, {NICKNAME}, Paimon.
Sigewinne: Everyone's usually busy around now, and we don't have any patients to look after in the infirmary, I thought I'd come here and enjoy the sight of everyone hard at work.
Paimon: Enjoy? What's there to enjoy here...?
Sigewinne: It's really worth watching... I often stand here and observe everyone. Humans are just so interesting and adorable, I like to watch your expressions while you work.
Paimon: Uh... Are you talking about pets or people?
Traveler: Do you also happen to be a veterinarian as well as head nurse?
Sigewinne: Oh... I can see why you'd think that, but you shouldn't jump to conclusions.
Sigewinne: See, we Melusines are a different species, and we see the world very differently from humans. It's very easy for me to observe everyone's condition. All it takes is one look and I can tell which workers are exhausted.
Paimon: Wait, Melusines can see that? Huh, that does sound useful for being a nurse.
Sigewinne: Yes, running around tending to everyone's health is very fulfilling, but I'd much prefer it if you were all happy and free from exhaustion and pain in the first place.
Sigewinne: Take care of your body and make sure you eat well. Always rest when you're tired from work and don't push yourself too hard.
Paimon: We'll definitely take care of ourselves, thanks for the reminder!

## Talk 27

Paimon: Hey look, there's something here... looks like a research notebook.
Paimon: That suspicious guy peeking into the infirmary just now... Is he a fan of Sigewinne?
Paimon: He must have dropped this. Let Paimon read it real quick...
Paimon: ...The Melusine perceive the world very differently from humans, there are significant deviations...
Paimon: ...As a result, their sense of aesthetics and beauty is also very different from that of humans. This must be taken into consideration when giving gifts.
Paimon: Whoa, this all sounds pretty serious... He sure did his homework.
Traveler: Won't he object to us looking through his notes?
Paimon: And as for the notebook... Let's take it.
Traveler: We should thank him for the intel.

## Talk 28

Paimon: Huh? Rowan? What are you doing here, Chief?
Rowan: Oh, uh... I was injured a bit just now. Nothing major, I think I just pulled something. Little mishaps like this are unavoidable at work, y'know...
Paimon: Huh, Paimon wouldn't have thought someone as experienced as the Chief would still get hurt on the job...
Rowan: Tch, I just knew you would say that... This is pretty embarrassing... *sigh* Ugh, where is Sigewinne when you need her anyway? The one time I need to make a quick trip to the infirmary...
Paimon: Oh? You mean she wasn't in the infirmary?
Rowan: Yeah, the rumors say that there's never anybody in the infirmary in the half hour before lunch, and nobody knows where Sigewinne gets off to.
Paimon: Huh, that's actually really strange. Sigewinne's always super dedicated to her work, where else would she possibly go...?
Rowan: *sigh* Forget it, I can take care of a small sprain like this on my own anyway, no need to trouble her.

## Talk 29

Collins: I heard you crazy fools really did it, you bought tickets to support both fighters, didn't ya? Well? Did anything happen?
Paimon: Well, the next day we received a mysterious package, but we still haven't made any sense of the contents...
Collins: So it is real... You didn't become cursed or anything like that, did ya? Are you both still okay? Wait, are you sure that it's still you controlling your bodies right now?
Paimon: #Uh, Paimon's not sure... What do you think, {NICKNAME}? Is Paimon still Paimon?
Traveler: Only you'd ever ask such a question, so I'm pretty sure you're fine.
Paimon: Oh, okay... well, that's good!
Collins: Yeah, you two don't seem to have changed at all, but I wouldn't let your guard down just yet...
Collins: Still, I didn't expect you would actually do it. You'd actually throw away coupons like that, just to satisfy your curiosity?
Paimon: Even if we bought tickets like everybody else, it's not like we could hope to earn any coupons...
Paimon: When it comes to things like this, it's always the organizer who makes the real profits.
Collins: Hey, just what are you trying to imply? The Pankration Ring is an honest business, and we really don't make much from selling tickets...
Collins: We make so little that even the current tournaments can only be held thanks to funding from the producer of Fonta.
Paimon: Oh, so it's the company that manufactures Fonta sponsoring the events? Paimon thought all of this was thanks to the Duke's support.
Collins: Let's just say it's a mutually beneficial arrangement... They reached out to us first, hoping to promote Fonta products in the Fortress of Meropide.
Traveler: I understand.
Collins: *sigh* Anyway, you try and take extra good care of yourselves these next few days, you hear?
Traveler: That's some important info.

## Talk 30

Traveler: Let's go investigate.
Traveler: (I don't think there are any more clues to be found here. Perhaps we should check the Production Zone or the Pankration Ring out...)

Traveler: (I don't think there are any more clues to be found here. Perhaps we should work at the Production Zone more often to see if we can discover anything unexpected...)

## Talk 34

Traveler: It's time for a rest.
Paimon: Okay, you should rest up. We'll be back at it tomorrow!

## Talk 35

Traveler: It's not time yet.
Paimon: Oh, okay then...

## Talk 36

Traveler: If you want a job done right, you have to do it yourself.
Paimon: Wow! Impressive philosophy. Could that be the secret sauce behind the blond Traveler's success?

## Talk 37

Traveler: Let's see if there's any really easy work...
Paimon: Yeah, it's good to kick back and relax once in a while.

## Talk 38

Collins: Not bad, not bad at all... Here, the coupons you won. Be sure not to lose 'em.
Collins: I'll be... they weren't exaggerating about how strong you are. Don't worry, I wouldn't dream of shortchanging you... Here're the Credit Coupons you won, put 'em somewhere safe.

## Talk 39

Collins: Your strength really shouldn't be underestimated. Now I get why you're prohibited from participating in any official fights.
Collins: Nobody who values their life would be willing to get in the ring with you.
Traveler: You flatter me.
Collins: However... You two haven't tried betting on the outcome of a pankration match yet, have ya?
Collins: Just go talk to Roussimoff. Buy a ticket for whichever fighter you think will win. There's a big payout if the fighter you support comes out on top.
Paimon: But we don't know anything about the fighters! How can we possibly know who to support...
Collins: That's normal, just watch a few matches and get a feel for the fighters. It won't be long before you can pick winners in your sleep.
Paimon: He's got a point... Why don't we give it a try? If we have enough coupons, we could probably bet at random until we figure everything out!
Collins: Bet at random, huh? Uh... Well, how should I put it? It's not like you can't do that, but I'd advise you to give it some more thought first, you wouldn't want to get too carried away, eh?
Paimon: Huh? We shouldn't get carried away? What's the problem?
Traveler: Could it be that...
Collins: ...
Collins: Never even picked a boxer before and you already know about the "rules"? You're not just strong fighters, seems you're pretty perceptive, too.
Traveler: Just a guess, that's all.
Collins: Ah, might as well tell you about it, since you already know that much... Plus, I think you've got the potential to be one of my greatest customers, I think I can let you in a bit.
Collins: Besides, I don't want to risk ever losing a customer like you...
Paimon: Huh, is it that serious?
Collins: OK, the "hidden rule" here is... If you buy both boxers' tickets and support them both...
Collins: Something bad will happen the next morning...
Paimon: So the rule is that we shouldn't pick both boxers in the same fight? But if anyone actually did that, wouldn't they be guaranteed to lose coupons... Who would do that anyway?
Paimon: And what do you mean by "something bad will happen"?
Collins: How would I know? Not like I'm stupid enough to do that.
Collins: But I've heard a story about the rule...
Collins: According to the rumor, there was a masked boxer who possessed incredible skill and power. None of his opponents even stood a chance against him...
Collins: However, in the final match, the organizers told him to take off his mask. He refused, and never showed up to the fight.
Collins: And after that, he was never seen again. Some say he died, or that he was taken care of by the event's organizers. But everyone remembers that he was someone who cherished honor above all else...
Collins: In his eyes, supporting both boxers in a match would dishonor the competition itself.
Paimon: So, you mean... It's like a curse? He'll take vengeance on anyone who does that?
Traveler: Do you know anything about him?
Collins: No, he was always wearing a mask, like he was intentionally trying to hide his identity. I don't even know anything about his past.
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, do you think that boxer was...
Traveler: Thank you very much for the information.
Paimon: Huh! We will!?
Collins: You're not serious, are you?
Collins: Look, here I was just trying to be nice and warn you, yet here you are trying to break it on purpose?
Paimon: Yeah, it sounds pretty scary to Paimon...
Traveler: It sounds like a good lead to me.
Paimon: *sigh* Seems you've made up your mind... Just be sure to protect Paimon, okay?
Collins: Betting on both fighters will set you back about 3,000 Credit Coupons. If you have enough, then go ahead and give it a try... Just don't come running back to me if something happens.
Traveler: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Traveler: We'll give it a try...
Traveler: Have you seen what he really looks like?
Traveler: The "hidden rules"... That's what they're called, right?
Traveler: There's some sort of "rule" here?
Traveler: Can't know for sure if you don't let me have a go.

## Talk 40

Roussimoff: Hmm? Are you two here to buy tickets? Better be quick about it, another match is about to start!
Paimon: Who are the boxers in the next round?
Roussimoff: We have the reigning champ, "Le Grappleur," versus a contender from the eastern prison block, "Demon Horde."
Paimon: Are those their nicknames? Or did they choose those names themselves... either way, suuuper weird.
Roussimoff: Since you're new around here, I'll help you out and give you a little suggestion. Even though Le Grappleur is the crowd favorite, Demon Horde is a first-class dark horse with incredible potential...
Roussimoff: Anyway, for this match, I recommend that you pick...
Traveler: We'll buy tickets for both fighters.
Roussimoff: Huh? F—For both fighters?
Roussimoff: Uh, I could tell you're new to this, but I didn't think you were completely clueless...
Roussimoff: Maybe you don't quite understand the rules, no? Let me try to explain again for you, more clearly. You see...
Paimon: Oh, no need, no need... We're aware that we're going to lose coupons.
Roussimoff: ...Alright, then, if you're absolutely sure. Remember, no refunds once you buy the tickets.
Paimon: Yeah, yeah, we got it. Just shut up and take our coupons!

## Talk 41

Traveler: Investigate the clues you discovered (-400 Coupons)
Paimon: We don't have enough coupons to skip work, let's go earn some more before trying to take any time off.

Traveler: Let's spend some coupons to skip work. (-400 Credit Coupons)
Paimon: We don't have enough coupons to skip work, let's go earn some more before trying to take any time off.

## Talk 43

Paimon: Paimon's beat... but after so many shifts, it seems we're really getting the hang of it now.
Traveler: It does seem to be getting easier.
Rowan: Hey there, fellow shift-mates! I saw you just finished your work so I thought I'd come over and say hi.
Paimon: Oh, hey there! We've seen you before, your assigned workspace is really close, isn't it?
Rowan: Haha, that's right. The name's Rowan. These past few days I couldn't help but notice the new faces working nearby, I guess we were destined to meet.
Rowan: I've been working here for almost 15 years. Even the foreman, Grainville, always calls me "Chief."
Paimon: Whoa, you've been working here a long time, Chief!
Traveler: Hey, Chief.
Rowan: Hahaha... If there's anything you'd like to know, just ask me. I know the work here in the production zone better than the back of my hand.
Paimon: Alright, Chief! We'll be sure to come to you first!
Traveler: I think I've got the work more or less down pat...
Rowan: ...
Rowan: Did you just ask about... the "rules"?
Rowan: Heh, pretty sharp for newcomers. You've already heard about the "rules," huh? ...Who'd you hear it from?
Traveler: I don't think you need to know that.
Rowan: Hmm... Alright, seeing as I'm the one who came over here and you're already callin' me "Chief," I guess I can tell you a little.
Rowan: Truth is, you two keep workin' like this, you might be puttin' yourselves in danger.
Paimon: Huh? Wait, there's even a rule about that? What would've happened if you never told us about this...?
Rowan: Well, it's usually not that easy to break one on accident... The conditions of the "hidden rules" are usually pretty specific, but once you do break one, bad things happen.
Traveler: So the conditions in this case are...?
Rowan: If you work continuously in the production zone for three days, and if all you do besides eating and sleeping is just work...
Rowan: Then something bad will happen during lunch on the third day.
Paimon: Huh! Like what!? Oooh, don't scare Paimon!
Rowan: Heh, if I knew that, then I wouldn't be standing here talking to you, now would I?
Paimon: You mean, even you have never tried working three days like that before?
Rowan: There's actually a legend about this rule...
Rowan: They say that there was a worker who worked way harder than me. He was both efficient and eager on the job, and most other workers couldn't hold a candle to him.
Rowan: One time, he tried to test his limits and worked as long as he could. Then, during lunch on the third day...
Rowan: He disappeared into thin air, as if he'd evaporated. Later, some people went and asked some of his past friends about him, but they said... "Never heard of the guy."
Paimon: What the...!? How could that happen?
Traveler: What did that worker look like?
Rowan: Unfortunately, we were assigned different production zones. I never saw for myself what he looked like.
Paimon: Wait, are you thinking that it was...
Traveler: Thank you very much for the information.
Paimon: Huh!?
Rowan: Oh?
Rowan: You... *sigh* Listen, kid, this ain't the kind of thing you should be curious about. Let me tell you, you're better off forgetting about it and looking after yourself. Now I kinda regret ever telling you...
Paimon: Yeah, I agree with Chief here... Do you really want to try?
Traveler: It sounds like a good lead to me.
Paimon: Oh, alright... If you insist...
Traveler: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Traveler: We'll give it a try...
Traveler: Did you ever see him?
Traveler: The "hidden rules"... That's what they're called, right?
Traveler: We just haven't quite learned all the "rules."
Traveler: In other words, you haven't managed any improvement in 15 years.
Paimon: Hey! Not so loud...
Traveler: All you do is float around telling me what to do.

## Talk 44

Traveler: Let's go investigate.
Traveler: (I don't think there are any more clues to be found here. Perhaps we should check the Production Zone or the Pankration Ring out...)

## Talk 45

Paimon: Whoa! Isn't this the super lucky meal!? Looks like hard work really does get rewarded!
Paimon: Paimon's going to take her time and savor every bite!
Paimon: Oh... Just a regular meal set. Guess Paimon shouldn't get her hopes up...
Paimon: #Wh—What is this garbage!? Ugh, it looks disgusting... Aw, Paimon misses your cooking now, {NICKNAME}...
Paimon: What would you like to do this afternoon?

## Talk 46

Traveler: Let's go investigate.
Paimon: Since we have time now, let's focus on investigating some more.
Paimon: Okay! Let's see if we can find any new leads.
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon felt like some of the people here were a little strange the moment she saw them...

## Talk 47

Traveler: Let's go to the Pankration Ring. (-300 Credit Coupons)
Paimon: Sure! If we're not gonna go to work, then let's kill some time at the Pankration Ring.
Paimon: Maybe we'll be able to find some leads there.
Paimon: Knowing Childe, he must've been there all the time...

## Talk 48

Traveler: It's time for a rest.
Paimon: Alright... By the way, it seems like we still haven't found all the clues regarding the strange liquid.
Paimon: No more strange packages are gonna show up... right?

## Talk 49

Traveler: Let's go to the Pankration Ring. (-300 Credit Coupons)
Paimon: Ugh, it costs 300 Credit Coupons to enter the ring.
Paimon: Let's save enough coupons first, and do something else for now.

## Talk 50

Paimon: Huh, we ended up here without even thinking about it... Wanna grab something to eat?

## Talk 51

Paimon: Paimon's exhausted, it's just work, work, and more work... Paimon's little body can't handle this much longer...
Paimon: Wait a sec, now that Paimon thinks about it... Haven't we been working nonstop for three days now? And now it's lunchtime!
Traveler: Mm.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon feels a shiver going down her spine! What's going to happen?
Paimon: But it doesn't seem like anything's changed at all... And we made it to the Coupon Cafeteria safely.
Paimon: Are the so-called "hidden rules" only a rumor, after all?
Traveler: Don't get your hopes up.
Paimon: Well, there's no use just guessing all day. Paimon's stomach has been grumbling the whole time, let's just eat already...
Paimon: Paimon wonders what we'll get today! Maybe we'll get the super lucky meal...
Paimon: Wait, what!?
Traveler: Huh!?
Paimon: Wh—What in the world is this!? What's with Paimon's food? And yours is the same...
Paimon: Is this stuff... meat? But it looks and feels so bizarre... What kind of chef would make food like this?
Traveler: I've never seen a welfare meal like this.
Paimon: #What do you think is going on, {NICKNAME}? Is this the "bad thing" that Rowan was talking about?
Traveler: Someone went missing before...
Paimon: N—no, stop right there, Paimon gets what you mean! Just don't say it!
Paimon: Hey, isn't that Wolsey over there? He must've made the food, right? So let's just ask him about the food and be done with it!
Paimon: Hey, Wolsey! Have a moment?
Wolsey: Hmm, what is it? I'm about to go report the numbers for today's free meal, so you'd better make it quick.
Paimon: Uh, it's about the meat in our meals. Look, does it seem... normal to you?
Wolsey: The meat? Oh, that... It looks perfectly fine to me, totally normal. You'd better hurry up and chow down.
Paimon: H—How could THIS be fine? Hey! Don't leave! You barely even looked at it... HEY!
Paimon: What should we do now? Wolsey wouldn't even give us the time of day... is he trying to hide something?
Traveler: Looks like we'll have to investigate it ourselves.
Paimon: Yeah, looks like we have no other choice. Paimon was positively famished a minute ago, but now she's lost her appetite...
Paimon: What would you like to do this afternoon?
Traveler: The plot thickens.
Traveler: And now our meals have this "strange meat"...
Traveler: There's something wrong with this "meat."
Traveler: This is...
Traveler: That would be quite a disappointment.
Traveler: You're just realizing that now?

## Talk 52

Traveler: If you want a job done right, you have to do it yourself.
Paimon: Wow! Impressive philosophy. Could that be the secret sauce behind the blond Traveler's success?

## Talk 53

Black Screen Text: You apply with Grainville to do some of the simpler processing tasks, and get some Credit Coupons without breaking a sweat.
Black Screen Text: As your concentration begins to slip and you rely more on muscle memory to complete the work, the quality of the finished widgets has dropped and you receive fewer coupons.

## Talk 54

Traveler: Let's end the shift.
Paimon: Alright, but remember that we bought this time with coupons, so let's make better use of it next time.

## Talk 55

Traveler: Time to go to the Pankration Ring (-3,000 Credit Coupons)
Paimon: Sure! If we're not gonna go to work, then let's kill some time at the Pankration Ring.
Paimon: Maybe we'll be able to find some leads there.
Paimon: Knowing Childe, he must've been there all the time...

## Talk 56

Lynette: Oh wonderful! I was worried that you'd be busy trying to earn Credit Coupons all the time, but it seems like you haven't neglected your investigation work after all.
Paimon: Paimon likes having more coupons, but no one wants to work all the time.
Paimon: Have you also been investigating the area, Lynette?
Lynette: No, I was just slacking off and you happened to catch me.
Traveler: And how's Lyney holding up?
Lynette: My brother is still obsessed with anything remotely related to the "forbidden zone." But knowing him, it won't be long before we get more leads.
Lynette: Oh, before I forget, this is for you.
Paimon: Huh? Credit Coupons? Why are you giving us these?
Lynette: I've been here longer than you. Coupons aren't a resource in particularly short supply. What is in short supply are interesting people to talk with.
Paimon: Aw, that's so nice of you, Lynette. We'll be sure to make good use of these coupons then. Thanks a bunch!

## Talk 57

Deakin: #Hey! It's {NICKNAME} and Paimon!
Traveler: Oh, so now you remember our names?
Deakin: Haha, no need to tease me, okay? I won't trip on the same step twice.
Deakin: Just like His Grace said, paying attention to every little detail is the key to prosperity. Hmm, maybe this is the true meaning of "rebirth," not just earning Credit Coupons...

## Talk 58

Grainville: Let me have a look... Hmm, not bad. Right, here's your Credit Coupons.

## Talk 59

Paimon: Ah, the dawn of a new day! Paimon feels like we're getting used to life as convicts. Uh, is that a good thing or a bad thing?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon doesn't want to get up... Paimon still feels completely exhausted from yesterday...
Paimon: Maybe we can make some progress in our investigation today.
Paimon: What do you have planned for us?

## Talk 60

Traveler: Let's go work in the production zone.
Paimon: Let's go! Credit Coupons, here we come!
Paimon: Right, we just need to keep at it...
Paimon: But Paimon really hopes the foreman will be in a better mood today...

## Talk 61

Traveler: Let's go work in the production zone.
Paimon: After working here so long, we're really starting to get the hang of it.
Paimon: #But doing the same thing all the time can get old pretty quickly. How are you holding up, {NICKNAME}?

## Talk 62

Traveler: Let's go to the Pankration Ring.
Paimon: Seems you're really getting the hang of things at the Pankration Ring now.
Paimon: But just playing the same game over and over... it's getting kinda tiring.

## Talk 63

Traveler: Maybe there's another way...
Paimon: Yeah, why don't we have Collins lower the difficulty a little? You know, so we can just breeze through each level!

## Talk 64

Traveler: Let's go to the Pankration Ring. (-300 Credit Coupons)
Paimon: Sure! If we're not gonna go to work, then let's kill some time at the Pankration Ring.
Paimon: Maybe we'll be able to find some leads there.
Paimon: Knowing Childe, he must've been there all the time...

## Talk 65

Traveler: Let's go investigate.
Paimon: Since we have time now, let's focus on investigating some more.
Paimon: Okay! Let's see if we can find any new leads.
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon felt like some of the people here were a little strange the moment she saw them...

## Talk 66

Deakin: #Hey! It's {NICKNAME} and Paimon!
Traveler: Oh, so now you remember our names?
Deakin: Haha, no need to tease me, okay? I won't trip on the same step twice.
Deakin: Listen, I feel ashamed about last time... Thank you for praising me in front of His Grace. Here are the extra Credit Coupons he gave me. I'd like you to have them.
Paimon: Huh? No, we couldn't take them. They're your reward, after all...
Deakin: But when I was welcoming you, I didn't do anything but give you the stink eye...
Deakin: *sigh* C'mon, I insist. These coupons are nothing compared to getting the attention of His Grace. I won't take no for an answer, haha.

## Talk 67

Fitzroy: Oh, h—hello... Y—You two are the ones who were with His Grace...
Paimon: No need to be so nervous!
Fitzroy: Sorry, I couldn't help but think of His Grace once I saw you, and I—I...
Traveler: Are you that scared of him?
Fitzroy: It's hard to say... Maybe I am. He's got a very overwhelming presence. It makes me feel like I'm just some insignificant little bug...
Paimon: Wait, seriously?
Fitzroy: I'm always indecisive, and I tend to make a mess of things... It's like a reflex, I just instantly start to tense up the moment I see a smart and capable person like His Grace...
Traveler: Oh, I get it, you want to take his place.
Fitzroy: What!? P—Please, d—don't say anything like that out loud... How could you possibly think something like that!?

## Talk 68

Traveler: Investigate the clues you discovered (-400 Coupons)
Paimon: Though it feels nice to slack off a little, less work means less coupons... Let's make the most of our morning!

## Talk 69

Paimon: Whoa! Isn't this the super lucky meal!? Looks like hard work really does get rewarded!
Paimon: Paimon's going to take her time and savor every bite!
Paimon: Oh... Just a regular meal set. Guess Paimon shouldn't get her hopes up...
Paimon: #Wh—What is this garbage!? Ugh, it looks disgusting... Aw, Paimon misses your cooking now, {NICKNAME}...
Paimon: What would you like to do this afternoon?

## Talk 70

Paimon: Oh? You want to stop investigating and go rest?

## Talk 71

Paimon: Hey, what are these papers scattered all over the ground? Are they registration forms or something?
Paimon: Hmm, maybe not... Every page has the Fonta Co. symbol on it. Maybe it's some flyers from the company?
Traveler: Let's take a look before anyone else shows up.
Paimon: Uh, okay. But if someone catches us, they could accuse us of trying to steal the company's secrets, couldn't they?
Traveler: What're you afraid of? We're already convicted criminals.
Paimon: Oh, hehe, you're right! Guess there's nothing to worry about then, let Paimon have a look here...
Paimon: ...Without assistance from the Fontaine Research Institute, development of the new product has been slow, and some researchers on the project have voiced concerns.
Paimon: We have no choice but to let the new product undergo the first phase of promotional trials without a designated name or packaging. We will adjust the direction of future development according to feedback...
Paimon: We have decided to only conduct closed, small-scale trials for the time being...
Paimon: Sure doesn't seem like anything unusual... The company is just trying to develop some new products besides Fonta, but it sounds like things aren't going well at all.
Paimon: Let's put these papers back where we found them, and make it look like nobody went through them... Okay, good.

## Talk 72

Promoter: *sigh* If there's no way to send it all out, then maybe I'll never get a chance to leave...
Paimon: Uh, who are you? We've never seen you before, and you don't look like a fellow convict.
Promoter: I'm not! Of course I'm not. Please don't mistake me for a criminal, I'm a good, law-abiding citizen.
Paimon: Then what are you doing here? You sure seem anxious about something.
Promoter: I'm a promoter for Fonta Co., and I'm usually responsible for promoting our drink products. I thought I could complete my task here quickly and return to headquarters, but I've been here way longer than I anticipated...
Paimon: Oh, a promoter from Fonta Co.! So what kind of problem did you run into?
Promoter: Ugh, I'm so upset... It's all because of that Duke.
Promoter: After discussing the company's promotional plans with him, he told me outright that my project was worthless.
Promoter: However, in light of our long history of successful collaboration, I still tried to patiently explain the details. However, to my surprise, he just cut me off while I was speaking!
Promoter: Let me take a moment and recall his exact words...
Promoter: I'm just gonna stop you there and say no. If anything, I'm saving you time.
Promoter: It seems you don't fully understand the value of Credit Coupons here, nor do you understand the value of your own products. The former is because you are from the overworld, that's understandable and I don't blame you for that.
Promoter: But as for the latter, only someone monumentally stupid, so breathtakingly stupid that they were completely ignorant of the value of Credit Coupons despite living in the underworld would ever possibly consider buying your drink. Let's just forget it.
Promoter: Anyway, that's how he rejected my proposal and asked me to come up with another solution with the condition that it doesn't cause any trouble for him. Can you believe that guy...?
Paimon: Uh, well, he is the head honcho here. Not much you can do about that. We met him too and could tell that he's the kind of guy that's hard to pin down.
Promoter: Fine, fine, I should just let it go... I'm on his turf, after all. His house, his rules.

## Talk 73

Paimon: So after working for a few days straight, we got some strange meat in our lunch... What was that all about?
Paimon: Hmm, has our investigation turned up anything useful recently?
Traveler: I think I've got something...
Paimon: Really? Then it looks like that part of the investigation has hit a dead end.
Paimon: #Well, we'll keep searching for more clues tomorrow. Good night, {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: But unfortunately, it's not related to Childe.

## Talk 74

Paimon: A mysterious box, a bottle of crimson liquid... Paimon still doesn't know what to make of it.
Paimon: #Do you have any ideas, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: I think I've got something...
Paimon: Really? Then it looks like that part of the investigation led us nowhere...
Paimon: #Well, maybe we'll have better luck tomorrow. Good night, {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: But unfortunately, it's not related to Childe.

## Talk 75

Traveler: Let's go investigate.
Traveler: (I don't think there are any more clues to be found here. Perhaps we should check the Production Zone or the Pankration Ring out...)

## Talk 76

Traveler: Let's go investigate.
Traveler: (I don't think there are any more clues to be found here. Perhaps we should check the Production Zone or the Pankration Ring out...)

Traveler: (I don't think there are any more clues to be found here. Perhaps we should check the Production Zone or the Pankration Ring out...)

## Talk 78

Traveler: Let's go work in the production zone.
Paimon: Let's go! Credit Coupons, here we come!
Paimon: Right, we just need to keep at it...
Paimon: But Paimon really hopes the foreman will be in a better mood today...

## Talk 79

Traveler: Let's go to the Pankration Ring.
Paimon: Sure! If we're not gonna go to work, then let's kill some time at the Pankration Ring.
Paimon: Maybe we'll be able to find some leads there.
Paimon: Knowing Childe, he must've been there all the time...

## Talk 80

Traveler: Let's go to the Pankration Ring. (-300 Credit Coupons)
Paimon: Ugh, it costs 300 Credit Coupons to enter the ring.
Paimon: Let's save enough coupons first, and do something else for now.

## Talk 81

Black Screen Text: You apply with Grainville to do some of the simpler processing tasks, and get some Credit Coupons without breaking a sweat.
Black Screen Text: As your concentration begins to slip and you rely more on muscle memory to complete the work, the quality of the finished widgets has dropped and you receive fewer coupons.

## Talk 82

Grainville: Look who decided to show up! Get your butts in gear and get to work, time's a-wasting!
Traveler: If possible...
Grainville: Oh? What's with suddenly wanting to work so hard? You need coupons that badly?
Paimon: S—Sure? Let's just say we really want to test our limits.
Black Screen Text: To investigate the "hidden rules," you and Paimon start working despite the lack of clarity...
Paimon: Nice, we did well today! Let's keep it up!
Paimon: Whew, Paimon's had it... Who knew that processing these widgets would be so tiring?
Paimon: That's it... Paimon doesn't even have the energy to talk anymore... Is it time to eat yet?
Traveler: C'mon. Lunchtime for Paimon.
Traveler: I'd like to apply for three continuous working days.

## Talk 83

Traveler: Let's go work in the production zone.
Paimon: Let's go! Credit Coupons, here we come!
Paimon: Right, we just need to keep at it...
Paimon: But Paimon really hopes the foreman will be in a better mood today...

## Talk 84

Grainville: Look who decided to show up! Get your butts in gear and get to work, time's a-wasting!
Traveler: Already on it!
Grainville: Good, here you go! Remember to give me the widget once you're finished processing it.
Traveler: Could you explain the job to me again?
Grainville: Your job is to use the machine over there to process these widgets.
Grainville: You step on the pedal when the timing is right. If the machine gets jammed, give it a good whack or two and it'll fix it right up. You got it?

## Talk 85

Paimon: Paimon's beat... but after so many shifts, it seems we're really getting the hang of it now.
Traveler: It does seem to be getting easier.
Rowan: Hey there, fellow shift-mates! I saw you just finished your work so I thought I'd come over and say hi.
Paimon: Oh, hey there! We've seen you before, your assigned workspace is really close, isn't it?
Rowan: Haha, that's right. The name's Rowan. These past few days I couldn't help but notice the new faces working nearby, I guess we were destined to meet.
Rowan: I've been working here for almost 15 years. Even the foreman, Grainville, always calls me "Chief."
Paimon: Whoa, you've been working here a long time, Chief!
Traveler: Hey, Chief.
Rowan: Hahaha... If there's anything you'd like to know, just ask me. I know the work here in the production zone better than the back of my hand.
Paimon: Alright, Chief! We'll be sure to come to you first!
Traveler: I think I've got the work more or less down pat...
Rowan: ...
Rowan: Did you just ask about... the "rules"?
Rowan: Heh, pretty sharp for newcomers. You've already heard about the "rules," huh? ...Who'd you hear it from?
Traveler: I don't think you need to know that.
Rowan: Hmm... Alright, seeing as I'm the one who came over here and you're already callin' me "Chief," I guess I can tell you a little.
Rowan: Truth is, you two keep workin' like this, you might be puttin' yourselves in danger.
Paimon: Huh? Wait, there's even a rule about that? What would've happened if you never told us about this...?
Rowan: Well, it's usually not that easy to break one on accident... The conditions of the "hidden rules" are usually pretty specific, but once you do break one, bad things happen.
Traveler: So the conditions in this case are...?
Rowan: If you work continuously in the production zone for three days, and if all you do besides eating and sleeping is just work...
Rowan: Then something bad will happen during lunch on the third day.
Paimon: Huh! Like what!? Oooh, don't scare Paimon!
Rowan: Heh, if I knew that, then I wouldn't be standing here talking to you, now would I?
Paimon: You mean, even you have never tried working three days like that before?
Rowan: There's actually a legend about this rule...
Rowan: They say that there was a worker who worked way harder than me. He was both efficient and eager on the job, and most other workers couldn't hold a candle to him.
Rowan: One time, he tried to test his limits and worked as long as he could. Then, during lunch on the third day...
Rowan: He disappeared into thin air, as if he'd evaporated. Later, some people went and asked some of his past friends about him, but they said... "Never heard of the guy."
Paimon: What the...!? How could that happen?
Traveler: What did that worker look like?
Rowan: Unfortunately, we were assigned different production zones. I never saw for myself what he looked like.
Paimon: Wait, are you thinking that it was...
Traveler: Thank you very much for the information.
Paimon: Huh!?
Rowan: Oh?
Rowan: You... *sigh* Listen, kid, this ain't the kind of thing you should be curious about. Let me tell you, you're better off forgetting about it and looking after yourself. Now I kinda regret ever telling you...
Paimon: Yeah, I agree with Chief here... Do you really want to try?
Traveler: It sounds like a good lead to me.
Paimon: Oh, alright... If you insist...
Traveler: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Traveler: We'll give it a try...
Traveler: Did you ever see him?
Traveler: The "hidden rules"... That's what they're called, right?
Traveler: We just haven't quite learned all the "rules."
Traveler: In other words, you haven't managed any improvement in 15 years.
Paimon: Hey! Not so loud...
Traveler: All you do is float around telling me what to do.

## Talk 86

Collins: Oh, back for another try? I hope you've brought enough Credit Coupons this time.
Traveler: Of course.
Collins: Alright, then get ready to play!

## Talk 87

Collins: #Oh? You must be {NICKNAME}, huh? Sorry, mate, but competitors as strong as you are prohibited from participating. I don't make the rules, mind you, but I was given very specific instructions...
Collins: Even convicts value their lives, don't they? I hope you can understand, haha...
Collins: But we have a game here that'll let you show off your strength, and you'll even earn some Credit Coupons in the process. What do you think? Interested?
Paimon: And if we lose the game? Will it cost us Credit Coupons?
Collins: Of course! That's the cruel reality facing every competitor in a place like the Pankration Ring.
Traveler: Alright, I'll give it a try.
Collins: Great, let me walk you through the rules.
Collins: The targets in front of you will pop up one after another.
Collins: You'll need to hit the targets in the same order that they popped up. If you can complete a few rounds in a row with no mistakes, then you'll win Credit Coupons.
Collins: But the second you mess up the order, you lose. Game over.
Collins: The game costs 300 Credit Coupons to have a go. So, you up for it?
Traveler: Sure, got your coupons right here.
Collins: Thanks for your patronage, mate. Now let the game begin!

## Talk 88

Collins: Pity, mate, you lost... that's too bad. I bet you'll get it next time though, won't ya?
Collins: You lost, mate... An off day for you, innit? You'll do better next time.

## Talk 89

Traveler: Let's spend some coupons to skip work. (-400 Credit Coupons)
Paimon: We don't have enough coupons to skip work, let's go earn some more before trying to take any time off.

## Talk 90

Traveler: Let's go work in the production zone.
Paimon: Let's go! Credit Coupons, here we come!
Paimon: Right, we just need to keep at it...
