# Feeling Like Fish Today!


## Talk 1

Paimon: Yikes, that's one strong fish. How's it still able to swim so fast, even after such a long struggle...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawrrr...
Paimon: #No worries, {NICKNAME}'ll definitely be able to catch it again!

## Talk 2

Paimon: This shallow water beach looks great! It's warm, bright, and there are fishing rods set up here. Maybe this would make a good fishing spot!
Paimon: Why don't we try fishing here?
Traveler: Maybe I'll catch myself another travel guide...
Paimon: No way, Paimon vetoes that idea. Besides, there's only one Paimon, and you already caught her!
Paimon: #Paimon's talking about fish-fishing! It's been a while since we last ate fish you caught and cooked yourself... Plus, it's about time you gave {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} a taste of your culinary wizardry!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: #Hehe, it's all for poor old {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}, y'know...
Traveler: Then why don't you get involved too, Paimon...
Traveler: How about... you do the fishing this time, Paimon?
Paimon: Huh? You want P—Paimon... to do the fishing?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Rawr!
Traveler: #All for poor old {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}, eh?
Paimon: How... How could you, catching Paimon out with her own words like that!
Paimon: Ugh, alright then... But be warned, Paimon has no idea what she'll catch, if anything!
Paimon: Plus, before that... Ace Angler Paimon needs a nice, tidy environment to work her magic in. What if the line gets snagged on all that junk floating around in the water?
Paimon: Let's tidy up the area a bit first!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Phew, nice and tidy at last... G—Guess it's time for Paimon to get started with the fishing!
Paimon: Just you wait and see, Paimon's gonna catch a big one!
Black Screen Text: Sadly, the surface stays as still as a mirror, without a ripple in sight.
Paimon: Uhh... Is there something wrong with the water here? The fish don't seem to want to come out, at all!
Traveler: So close, hehe...
Paimon: So close! Yet... so far. Ugh, why does it feel like this is gonna take forever...
Paimon: It's a bit early to be getting Paimon's hopes up!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr...
Traveler: You've got it! You've got it!
Paimon: Hey, stop being such a distraction... Jeez!
Paimon: Ehh!? We've got a bite, we've got a bite! Time to reel it in and see what Paimon's caught!
Paimon: #What the... that's not a fish, it's a bottle! And it's even tied to one of the wooden planks at the fishing spot... Ugh, well, the fact that you always catch strange things too makes Paimon feel a little better, {NICKNAME}...
Traveler: You seem to be able to catch anything... but fish.
Paimon: Hey, you catch weird stuff all the time too! Anyway, seeing as Paimon already caught it, we might as well take a look at what's inside...
Paimon: Could it have been these two that left behind that pile of stuff just now? People who are this obsessed with fishing are... pretty scary, huh...
Paimon: Seems like they're using this bottle to pass messages to one another... We'd better throw it back.
Paimon: Aaaanyway, Paimon has a funny feeling that it'll definitely be a fish next time!
Black Screen Text: The rod suddenly drops downwards and starts being violently tugged.\nSeems like something big and heavy deep down below has taken the bait...
Paimon: A bite, at last! Must be one heckuva fish... Up you come, you big lump!
Traveler: That's right, you big lump! Up you come!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: R—Rawr!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): #Seeing Paimon struggling,\nyou and {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} grab hold of her...\nBut the line is being pulled with such unstoppable force...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): Finally, with a mighty plop, the fish escapes...
Paimon: *sobs* That must have been a huge one, otherwise it would never have gotten away!
Paimon: Ugh, so annoying... Huh? It's still swimming around near the surface! Seriously!?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawrr—
Paimon: No no no, the sea's too dangerous! And you'll never catch up with it anyway...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr...
Paimon: #If only we could find a way to catch that fish, {NICKNAME}...
Traveler: It won't be long, trust me! Just stay cool!
Paimon: Hmm, you're probably right. After all, once the bites start coming, it all happens so fast. Like when you go to pick a Sweet Flower, but it turns out to be a Whopperflower...
Paimon: All you gotta do is stay focused and wait... and wait...

## Talk 4

Paimon: #Tada! What did Paimon tell ya? If anyone could get the better of this slippery customer, it'd be {NICKNAME}!
Paimon: Speaking of skills, if we just threw in all the bait and let the fish get so full that they turned over and floated up to the surface... that would still count as "fishing," right?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rrrar... Rawr...
Paimon: #Hehe, you think so too, don't you, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}? Paimon can tell just from the way your eyes are twinkling! Hehe, let's give it a try next time...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawrrr...
Paimon: #Wait a sec, it's not done yet! We have to wait for {NICKNAME} to finish cooking it first!
Black Screen Text: Once the fish is finished grilling, everyone sits down and eats their fill.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: Wah... Even as Grilled Fish goes, that was something special. You can really tell that Paimon was the one who caught it, hehe!
Traveler: Great job, Paimon! You're in charge of fishing from here on out!
Paimon: Uhhh... *sigh*
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: #Hey, there's no such thing as a free lunch, y'know, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}! You'll have to help out too next time — if you want any fish, that is!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rrrawr?
Paimon: Hmph, look who's playing dumb now!
