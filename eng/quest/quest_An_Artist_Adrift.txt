# An Artist Adrift


## Talk 1

Julien: Speaking of which, what brings the two of you here? You're not here for the same reasons as me... right?
Paimon: You mean, did we travel here just to make some art? Nah, of course not!
Paimon: #Traveler's a registered adventurer. It should be no surprise finding him in every corner of Teyvat!

## Talk 2

Paimon: That's a drawing board! That's gotta be Julien's. Let's haul it back together with the rest. The tea's probably ready by now, so we've gotta hurry!

## Talk 3

Paimon: What a simple camp... Paimon wonders if you could even call it a camp.
Julien: Well, the scenery here is quite good, and there's a sense of openness whenever I stand by the water. It's honestly a lot more relaxing than when I was in Fontaine.
Paimon: What sort of life did you lead while you were there, seriously? That's... not quite what Paimon was expecting from a renowned artist.
Julien: I lived in a very small place back in Fontaine... And um, that's only because I'm a humble person.
Paimon: But even outdoor adventurer camps look way better than this. Huh? You have an animal buddy?
Julien: Um, I don't have one. This must've been left behind by an adventurer or something like that. Speaking of which...
Julien: I would love to receive you in better fashion, but most of my luggage fell into the water when my raft fell apart, and I cannot swim...
Julien: But if you could find my lost luggage for me...
Traveler: Would it even be usable after getting soaked like that...
Julien: I did carefully pack everything up, but there are some things that... *sigh* Well, if I've lost them, I've lost them. I can always redraw them... yes, redraw them...
Paimon: Um, perhaps we should help out. This guy seems like he's in a real bad spot.
Julien: I have no one else to rely on here, so I can only ask the two of you for aid. I'll be waiting here with some good tea in hand.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Strange. Why would there be a dog here? And it seems to be guarding something, too.
Dog: (Watches you warily.)
Traveler: Smart doggie.
Dog: (Gives a short bark.)
Paimon: Right, didn't we see a food bowl back at Julien's camp? Maybe it belongs to this fella! Strange, though. Didn't Julien say that he didn't have any animal companions?
Dog: *whimpers*
Black Screen Text: The dog runs toward the camp...
Paimon: It's gone... Let's ask Julien about this later. For now, though... Paimon wonders what's under this sand pile. Should we take a look?
Traveler: Where did this wild dog come from, anyway...
Dog: (Gives a low growl.)

## Talk 5

Paimon: We're back! Huh, so it is your animal companion, Julien!
Dog: (Lets out a threatening growl.)
Julien: Wonderful, Pepper... Taken to growling at me, have you? Don't you know who's keeping us both fed here?
Paimon: (Oh, so it has a name! But on the other hand... is this guy seriously arguing with a dog?)
Traveler: (They seem to be really close.)
Paimon: (Is that what "close" looks like to you!?)
Paimon: Hey, Julien! We found the stuff you lost! Pepper's your animal buddy, isn't it? Why did you lie to us earlier?
Julien: If this ungrateful fellow counts as my buddy... I'd rather adopt a Rifthound.
Traveler: I doubt that you'll be companions for very long...
Paimon: Exactly. If someone like you, who faints from hunger, ran into a Rifthound, the resulting problem wouldn't be one we could solve with just a Teyvat Fried Egg...
Paimon: Speaking of which, it seems to have been guarding a drawing board on the beach.
Traveler: It might have wanted to hide it...
Paimon: Bad doggie!
Dog (Pepper): (Barks, seemingly in protest.)
Julien: Are you seriously whining about this? If I hadn't followed you into this corner, I could've returned to Fontaine via my original path...
Paimon: Eh? Didn't you say that you ended up taking the waterways because you wanted to see the sights there?
Julien: ...
Julien: Okay, fine... The truth is, I didn't even get to enjoy Sumeru's scenery — I just followed the dog and ended up in this place. The roads here point in all directions, so it was impossible to not get lost...
Paimon: Oh, so that's how it was. C'mon, you should have just told us the truth from the start! Why didn't you?
Julien: Um... To... preserve the image of a renowned artist?
Paimon: Ugh, you sound like you're just trying to fake us out when you stammer like that, and you're not very good at it either!
Paimon: #But speaking of scenery here in Sumeru, Traveler and Paimon do happen to know some good spots. We can take you there.
Julien: N—No need. Um, I mean... thanks for your offer, but I am a renowned artist, after all. Ultimately, I believe that worthwhile sceneries must be ones that we discover ourselves...
Julien: Oh, and the tea's ready. Do you also happen to have more fried eggs? You know, as a little snack to go with the tea...
Traveler: What an unusual combo.
Paimon: #Exactly! Traveler's a master of many dishes! We can always have something else instead, hehe.
Black Screen Text: You enjoy the tea together with some snacks.
The tea's taste is hard to describe...
Paimon: Um, this tea...
Julien: A friend of mine sold it to me. Apparently, it can activate the potential wisdom within you. I think it tastes great.
Traveler: I'm glad I don't have any friends like that.
Julien: How come? Having friends is a good thing. In fact, I came to Sumeru on a friend's recommendation as well.
Julien: Thank you both for what you've done for me today. I hope the compensation I prepared meets your expectations...
Paimon: It's fine, it's just... You sure you don't need our help in gathering inspiration? Paimon feels like you might get lost.
Julien: The point of a pilgrimage... I mean, the point of a journey lies in walking it by oneself. I shouldn't trouble you two any further. I will undertake this myself.
Paimon: Well, sure, if you say so. Make sure you don't faint from hunger on the road again!
Traveler: Could you give me another cup?
Paimon: #You sure there's nothing wrong with your taste buds, Traveler?
Julien: Haha, not to be stingy or anything, but I'll still be in Sumeru for a while, so I need to save some for myself.
Traveler: That sounds like wishful thinking to me.
Paimon: Hmm... But tea alone feels like it's missing something, you know? Let's just whip something up.
Traveler: It might have been protecting the drawing board from being stolen.
Paimon: But it ran off the moment we found it!
Traveler: (I don't smell any wine...)
Paimon: (Is he just usually like that? Seems like a rather troublesome guy...)
