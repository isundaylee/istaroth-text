Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "I discovered that there's a Melusine who sits there every day, sighing. Has she run into some kind of trouble?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Are you talking about Menthe? She's always saying something like 'The Iudex is above' or whatever, she must have run into some kind of intractable problem."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Menthe works for the Maison Gardiennage. She can only have become so depressed because of encountering so much unfathomable darkness in the course of her work. I truly feel sorry for her."
