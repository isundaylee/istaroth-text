Traveler: About the storybooks...
Wolfy: You guys like to read storybooks? Me too!
Wolfy: I like to imagine I'm a character in the book when I read. Sometimes I'm Wolfy the Brave, others Wolfy the Wise... and sometimes, I'm even the Big Bad Wolfy!
Wolfy: "Awoooo! Foolish Traveler! You dare enter this fortress of doom without invitation! Prepare to be eaten alive!"
Wolfy: What do you think? Totally got that "Big Bad Wolf" energy, right?
Wolfy: ...These stories are like those dreams, they're all shining memories, treasures that belong only to me. They are also a weapon that makes me invincible, no matter what situation I may face.
