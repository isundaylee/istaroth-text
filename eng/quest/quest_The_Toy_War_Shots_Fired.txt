# The Toy War: Shots Fired


## Talk 1

Arbon: Boss, our two guests have returned.
Livre: The two of you are quick indeed... As expected of people recommended by the Adventurers' Guild. I'm Livre, the owner of this shop. Welcome.
Paimon: Hey there, boss. So you and Caron are brothers! We didn't know about that, and he saw through us right away.
Arbon: Seriously, Alberre? You didn't tell them something this important?
Alberre: Seriously, Arbon? Didn't we agree that you'd tell them? If you're gonna cut anyone's salary, Boss, cut his!
Paimon: Hey, are you two brothers too?
Arbon (Arbon & Alberre): What? Don't call this guy my brother!
Livre: Ahem... So what you mean to say is that the mission's a bust? You didn't find anything?
Paimon: Well, no. Caron is a really nice guy, and he didn't mind even though he knew about us. He even told us that we could try the toy out anytime.
Livre: Hehe, that guy... So, is that toy alchemically-powered?
Traveler: No, it's an adventurer toy.
Livre: Hmph. Those things are so corny. Didn't he say that he incorporated some adventurers' story into it, or something?
Paimon: That's right. How did you know? Did you already investigate the matter, or something?
Livre: Hah, I just know him all too well. He always puts something sentimental into his toys without caring about the market situation. If you ask me, adventure stories are long out of fashion.
Traveler: But his shop is very popular, isn't it?
Livre: That's just ordinary market fluctuations. Once our Champion Duelist lineup takes the stage, we'll have him beat, easy!
Paimon: But those aren't real Champion Duelists! They're the result of us "out of fashion" adventurers play-acting.
Livre: Hah, what do the two of you know? This is what we call packaging! It's standard practice on the market, and no one cares how exactly you do it.
Livre: We're just going to get the data and put it into some popular toy prototypes, and claim that it's a story about the growth of a Champion Duelist — and that'll do the trick just fine!
Paimon: Really? That's it? Paimon feels like there'll definitely be problems this way...
Livre: It's fine if the story has issues. It's all about the gimmick.
Livre: What would you think if I told you that Arbon and Alberre are in fact ultra-realistic, ultra-high-quality puppets based on the theme of "double act"?
Paimon: What? They're puppets? Can puppets look so real!?
Arbon: Of course they can.
Alberre: That's the power of a double act! Tricks can seem very real indeed!
Livre: See that? That's the power of packaging. Even a gimmick can, when presented the right way, generate interest!
Paimon: Ugh, so it was just a trick! You cheater... You couldn't be more different from your brother.
Livre: Well, that's his problem for not staying in his clockwork lane. If he wants to stick his nose into the toymaking business, it's my duty as his older brother to show him what's what.
Traveler: Quite the dab hand, aren't you?
Livre: Thanks for the compliments. In that case, eyes up, you two. The data collection will be run by Arbon and Alberre.
Paimon: Hehe, well, we're just gonna turn a blind eye to your brotherly conflict. Just don't skimp on our payments.
Traveler: None more conniving than a merchant, I see.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Whoa, there are a ton of people here! Looks like the toys really are popular.

## Talk 3

Caron: Hello, dear customers. I'm Caron, the owner of this shop. What can I do for you?
Paimon: Hey there, boss! We've heard that you've come up with an awesome toy, so we'd like to know more about it.
Caron: Haha, of course you can. Still... My elder brother sent you here to seek out information, didn't he?
Paimon: Eh? Your brother? Wait... Actually, how did you know what we were here for?
Caron: Oh, I just saw you walking out from the clockwork workshop, that's all. My brother owns that shop, and I know him, and what he'd do. This is right up his alley.
Paimon: Exposed before we could even get started...
Paimon: Ugh, we should've prepped more before coming over. How were we supposed to know that you're brothers? Ugh, now this isn't just a matter of corporate competition, is it? It's brother against brother!
Traveler: Paimon, mind your language, please.
Paimon: Sorry boss, Paimon's brain-gears got stuck there for a minute.
Caron: Don't worry. Even the best-made toys have components that will get stuck at some point. It's the same with people, you need to take good care of them.
Caron: Besides, I don't think you're wrong about how my brother sees our relationship. Regardless, I won't take up more of your time than needed. Let me talk about these toys instead!
Paimon: Um... Are you sure this is okay? We're... we're supposed to be secretly gathering intel!
Caron: Hahaha, such interesting things you say, dear customers! Our store's real bread and butter is clocks, which we make using techniques handed down from generation to generation.
Caron: Toys are just my personal hobby. They bring happiness to people, so if I let more people know about them, is that not the same as spreading happiness?
Paimon: Wow, that's such a... nice way of thinking about things!
Caron: Haha, my brother would probably say that this line of thinking is too unadventurous... But that aside, why don't you have a look at the toy? I hope you'll like it.
Traveler: I heard that you got your inspiration from Mondstadt.
Caron: Indeed, I've liked the place since I was little, and when I went there recently, it was indeed a rewarding experience for me.
Caron: I incorporated the story of an adventurer I met there into the toy, but don't set your expectations too high, alright? In the end, it's just a simple clockwork device.
Paimon: An adventurer? So it's not a product of alchemy, then?
Caron: An alchemical toy? That sounds interesting. But this adventurer made quite the impression. If there's time, I'll tell you his story.
Caron: Would you like to try the toy out now? There's nothing quite like experiencing it for yourself.
Paimon: #We'd love to, but they're still waiting for our reply on the other end. We should get there first, Traveler, and then come right back! Paimon really wants to try this adventurer toy right away!
Caron: Alright then. Remember, you're always welcome here.

## Talk 4

Caron: Hello, dear customers. I'm Caron, the owner of this shop. What can I do for you?
Paimon: That's a lot of people you've got here. Is there some event going on?
Caron: Oh, no, I wouldn't call it that. We just have a new product. A toy, to be precise — the one at the entrance. If you're interested, you can come and try it out anytime.

## Talk 5

Arbon: I need to go tell the boss that the two guests he invited have arrived.
Alberre: Well, go and return quickly, then, before I die of boredom watching the store alone.

## Talk 6

Caron: Hmm... Armand seems to be doing a lot better lately.

## Talk 7

Armand: H—H—Hello, you t—two... My name is... is... A—A—Armand...

## Talk 8

Caron: Well, aren't you the customers I saw earlier? Do you need anything?
Paimon: That's right, it's us! We've heard that that toy of yours is super awesome so we'd like to know more about it.
Caron: Haha, of course you can. Still... My elder brother sent you here to seek out information, didn't he?
