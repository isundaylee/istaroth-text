# Golden Chicken Burger

A hamburger in which the fowl meat is the main star. The fluffy bread sandwiches slices of fresh vegetables and a flavorful, crispy fowl fillet. No utensils required here: Just grab it in your hands and bite down on that bundle of rich, satisfying succulence with a hearty "ker-runch!"
