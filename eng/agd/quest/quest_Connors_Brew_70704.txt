# Connor's Brew


## Talk 1

Traveler: So, I heard someone needs Flaming Flower Stamens...
Connor: Yes, that was a commission I sent out. I must say, that was rather quick...
Connor: So, have you gathered the three Flaming Flower Stamens that I need?
Traveler: Here they are.
Traveler: Not yet.
Connor: Well then, give them to me as soon as you're done gathering them. I have wine to brew.

## Talk 2

Connor: Yes, this will do. Please accept this small token from me as thanks for your help.
Connor: While I'm not certain if we can brew anything sufficiently special with these ingredients...
Connor: But I'm sure that this will be a memorable brewing experience nonetheless.
