Traveler: About Pankration...
Roussimoff: It's a very healthy sport!
Roussimoff: If you ask me, you really lose out by being the host! Sure, you get the best seat in the house, but do you think I want to be just watching?
Roussimoff: I want to get in the ring too, and go head-to-head with the best opponents!
Roussimoff: Though when I say it like that, it does seem to lack a bit of theatricality, which hand-to-hand combat only has so much of in the first place. I'll have to come up with some other limitations...
Roussimoff: But on the other hand, we've been holding quite a few recreational matches recently. Maybe it's time to get back to the roots? Yeah, it's worth giving some serious thought.
