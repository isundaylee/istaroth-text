## Talk

Albedo: #Hello, Traveler.
Albedo: I heard the sound of footsteps from afar, and here you are.

## Talk

Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Albedo: Hm, I believe that the utopia referenced in literature would likely resemble this place.
Albedo: Peaceful and comforting, enough for one to forget the time while pouring oneself into research.
Traveler: Remember to eat on time.
Albedo: ...
Albedo: Yes, of course.
Albedo: Ah, right...
Albedo: I will often sketch my surroundings. Your arrangements in this realm also provide a source of inspiration for me.
Albedo: ...Thank you.
Traveler: You can tell me if you need anything.
Albedo: Hm... Let your creative instincts run unabated, and I should be quite content.

## Talk

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Albedo: Certainly.
Albedo: Uh... I will let you decide the topic of our conversation.
Traveler: You really like to draw...
Albedo: Yes, this is a habit that I formed a long time ago.
Albedo: Initially, it was for research purposes. I originally tried to reproduce subjects with a rubbing technique.
Albedo: However, the results were inadequate and lacked spirit.
Albedo: After that, I tried to learn how to draw.
Albedo: While refining my artistic skills, I unconsciously found myself engrossed in drawing.
Albedo: Hmm, anything else...?
Albedo: Probably you.
Albedo: At first, it was because you carry the aura of the stars.
Albedo: But now... it seems that there is more to it.
Albedo: Why is this? Give me some time and I can conduct experiments to find out.
Traveler: You really like to conduct experiments...
Albedo: Hmm, if you ask me, the world is a limitless library.
Albedo: There's a multitude of research topics for experiments...
Albedo: You can use your own hands to unearth unknown secrets and ultimately master new knowledge.
Albedo: This sort of feeling is captivating.
Traveler: Is there anything else you're interested in?

## Talk

Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Albedo: Heh, where should I begin...?
Albedo: In your company, I never lack inspiration.
Traveler: For drawing?
Albedo: It's good for both drawing and experiments.
Albedo: And not just for these, but for many other things.
Albedo: Speaking of which... I used to think interaction with others was a waste of time.
Albedo: But after meeting you, I'd rather spend my time on you than other matters.
Albedo: This is a unique anomaly. I think I likely know the reason why.
Albedo: So can you also... give me more of your time?
Traveler: I'll accompany you while you sketch.
Albedo: Thank you. Then, today's subject—
Albedo: You and your realm.
Albedo: By the way, after we're done, may I have the pleasure of inviting you to dessert with me?
Albedo: To continue our time together, and to thank you for your company.
Traveler: I'll accompany you during your experiments.
Albedo: Thank you. I'll guarantee your safety, as I've done before.
Albedo: We already understand each other quite well, don't we?
Traveler: For experiments?

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Albedo.
Albedo: #Morning, Traveler. I've already organized my next stage of research objectives.
Albedo: But should you have other arrangements, I don't necessarily mind revising my plans.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Albedo.
Albedo: Good night. May you have sweet dreams.
Albedo: ...You don't require me to read you a bedtime story, do you?

## Talk

Albedo: This is a nice workshop. Looks like I will be able to continue my research here as well.
Albedo: Hmm, I believe that you must have acquired some sort of secret art that allows you to copy things from the real world, is this not so?
Albedo: If you don't mind, I'd like to conduct some further research with you. Perhaps it may be of some help to you.

## Talk

Albedo: A fascinating copy... You have attended to every fine detail — even the feeling of the wilderness that one can only experience when adventuring themselves.
Albedo: Alright then. I'll go ahead and start sketching.
Albedo: Would you mind... if I make you the subject matter of my sketch?
