Traveler: Sounds good, I'm an excellent singer.
Batz: Ah, then this must be fate! I've got a lot of records over at my place. I'll be sure to invite you if a concert comes up.
Batz: Actually, that reminds me... The People of the Springs are huge fans of music, too. Their music's a lot more laid back, though — kinda like the hot springs they're known for.
Batz: Our music is a lot more rhythmic in nature — you can even work with it playing in the background. Even Xilonen, the most famous engraver here, has borrowed my records a few times.

Traveler: Sorry, I'm not the best singer...
Batz: That's okay! You don't have to be an expert to listen to music.
Batz: I'm not a professional musician, either — my regular job is working as a caretaker for the Tepetlisaurs. That hasn't stopped me and my Saurian friends from appreciating music, though.
Batz: If I have to make an analogy, it'd be like how some people love to listen to music as they do their chores. Aren't there a lot of people like that?

Traveler: Sorry, but I have other things to do at the moment.
Batz: Aww, that's a pity. Well, maybe later, then!
