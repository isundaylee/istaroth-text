# How to Make Friends


## Talk 1

Tlamot: That poor little Yumkasaurus... That does it. I'll show them. I'll show those scoundrels!
Tlamot: You can run, you louts, but you can't hide!
Traveler: What happened?
Tlamot: You're... a traveler from afar, then? Greetings to you — though I fear I cannot extend any hospitality to you beyond that.
Tlamot: Those wretched Treasure Hoarders were aiming to catch that little Yumkasaurus again. Fortunately, I was on hand to chase them off.
Tlamot: But the poor thing's been scared stiff. He won't come any closer no matter how I call out.
Tlamot: No matter. I've found their hideout. I'm going to teach them a lesson, and once I do, I'll have 'em lashed to a tree, and lashed with one too!
Tlamot: Also, I'll have to find something tasty to comfort that poor little frightened Yumkasaurus...

## Talk 2

Tlamot: ...Shh. Look over there. He's waiting for us.
Timid Little Yumkasaur: ...Woo? Mmwoo...?
Tlamot: Come here, kiddo. We're not gonna hurt ya.
Timid Little Yumkasaur: Mwoo? Mmmmrawr...
Tlamot: I'm Tlamot. Remember me? I'm the one who gave you those delicious treats before.
Traveler: #And I'm Traveler.
Timid Little Yumkasaur: Roar... Rawrrrr!
Black Screen Text: You play with the happy Yumkasaurus for a while. It seems he's in a much better mood...
Timid Little Yumkasaur: Raar! Oroo, rrooh!
Tlamot: #This... Hey, Traveler, looks like he sees you as a friend already! We both got gifts too.
Timid Little Yumkasaur: Rawr! Rawr!
Traveler: Thanks a lot.
Timid Little Yumkasaur: Rawr! Rawrrr! Rawr!
Black Screen Text: The little Yumkasaurus happily circles you twice before turning and diving into the woods once more.
Tlamot: Looks like he's gone home. Just hope he doesn't run into any more of those scoundrels.
Tlamot: Let's head back as well. Here, take these as compensation.
Traveler: Two rounds of compensation for one commission.
Tlamot: Well, then you'd best keep the share you got from our little Yumkasaurus well. As for what I gave you... Haha, just spend it on whatever you want.
Traveler: Well, this was a profitable excursion.
Traveler: And I found some of said delicious treats.

## Talk 3

Tlamot: ...Shh. Look over there. He's waiting for us.
Timid Little Yumkasaur: Friend...? Don't know... Good people...?
Tlamot: Come here, kiddo. We're not gonna hurt ya.
Timid Little Yumkasaur: Good people...? Friends...
Tlamot: I'm Tlamot. Remember me? I'm the one who gave you those delicious treats before.
Traveler: #Hi, I'm Traveler.
Traveler: And I found some of said delicious treats.
Timid Little Yumkasaur: You... Friend!
Black Screen Text: You play with the happy Yumkasaurus for a while. It seems he's in a much better mood...
Timid Little Yumkasaur: For you, for you, gift!
Tlamot: #This is... Heh, looks like we both got presents, eh, Traveler?
Timid Little Yumkasaur: Friend, thank you!
Traveler: Thank you!
Timid Little Yumkasaur: Friend! Friend! Good! Good! See you again!
Black Screen Text: The little Yumkasaurus happily circles you twice before turning and diving into the woods once more.
Tlamot: Looks like he's gone home. Just hope he doesn't run into any more of those scoundrels.
Tlamot: Let's head back as well. Here, take these as compensation.
Traveler: Two rounds of compensation for one commission.
Traveler: Well, this was a profitable excursion.
Tlamot: Well, then you'd best keep the share you got from our little Yumkasaurus well. As for what I gave you... Haha, just spend it on whatever you want.

## Talk 4

Paimon: These should do it... Let's go look for Tlamot.

## Talk 5

Tlamot: This is where he normally hangs out, but there's not a trace of him today...
Tlamot: He must've hidden after that scare.
Traveler: Should we go searching for him?
Tlamot: ...Nah. Let's leave him in peace for a while. We'll just leave the mushrooms here.
Traveler: You've got experience, I see...
Tlamot: In taking care of that kid? Definitely. I've been looking after him for a while now, so I know he's a sensitive sort. Even the sight of strangers might spook him.
Tlamot: Only after I fed him for a long time was he willing to approach me... But I doubt he'll be coming out any time soon, now that those villains have made a mess of everything.
Tlamot: We'll need to leave him alone for a while.
Tlamot: Thanks for coming along. Here's the reward.
Traveler: It's just a pity that we couldn't see him.
Tlamot: Don't worry, he remembers those who've done right by him. When the time is right, he will definitely come to see us.
Traveler: I'd love to have met that little Yumkasaurus.

## Talk 6

Tlamot: This is the Treasure Hoarders' camp. C'mon. Time to teach them a lesson!
Tlamot: You, again!? I told you before, we just wanted to pet that little Saurian!
Tlamot: Enough! You really think I can't see the rope in your hand!?
Tlamot: Come on, bro! We bought this from your tribe... It's for bungee jumping!
Tlamot: Hey! Stop hitting me, please! I'm going, I'm going!

## Talk 7

Tlamot: Hmph. Let's see them dare to hurt my little Yumkasaurus ever again, eh?
Traveler: Feels like there's been some sort of misunderstanding...
Tlamot: Don't listen to their pretty words. Why, I saw them tie a rope to that poor Yumkasaurus's tail with my own eyes!
Tlamot: Who knows what might have happened if I hadn't shown up when I had.
Tlamot: Thanks for your aid, in any case. Here's your payment.
Tlamot: It's just a shame they fled so fast. If we'd caught them, we could put an end to their troublemaking once and for all!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Tlamot: #We meet again, Traveler. Well, then, what do you say to lending me a hand, just like last time?
Tlamot: Those Treasure Hoarders never learn their lesson, do they? If we leave them be, they'll only be emboldened to continue doing evil.
Tlamot: The little Yumkasaurus is safe for now, but he's still a young 'un. He still needs more care...

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: I'd suggest you focus on the comforting.
Tlamot: Alright. That'll cheer him up, I hope.
Tlamot: Those Treasure Hoarders shouldn't come looking for trouble with both of us around.
Tlamot: Let me think for a moment... please go to the tree over there and pick two fresh Candlecap Mushrooms.
Tlamot: Once you've gathered them, let's meet up at the cliff near the Stadium again. Those Treasure Hoarders won't try anything funny with you there.

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: Let's go teach those Treasure Hoarders a lesson.
Tlamot: No problem. Those unrepentant Treasure Hoarders just set up a new camp — I've marked it out.
Tlamot: I'll pay you based on Adventurers' Guild rules. Let's get going, shall we?

### Additional Talk 4

Tlamot: Ah, he's gone... Oh well. Let's just leave the Candlecap Mushrooms here.
Traveler: It's just a pity that we couldn't see him.
Timid Little Yumkasaur: Rawr! Rawrrr! Rawr...
Traveler: Hmm? I think I hear something.
Tlamot: Let's just let him be for now. Maybe he'll be willing to come closer to us once he's grown a bit.
Tlamot: Regardless, the important thing is that he's living a happy life.
Tlamot: Hey there— We're heading off!
Traveler: We're heading off!
Tlamot: Ah yes, take this. You deserve this much as thanks for your help.
Tlamot: I do hope that kid grows up soon — that way, he can just send those Treasure Hoarders flying with a couple of kicks!
Traveler: See you next time!
Traveler: Is he hiding around the corner?
Traveler: I'd love to have seen that little Yumkasaurus again.

### Additional Talk 5

Timid Little Yumkasaur: Rawr!? Hrrrooor, rawr!
Traveler: Thank you!
Timid Little Yumkasaur: Wooo... Rawr! Wooo... Raawrrr!
Black Screen Text: The little Yumkasaurus dives into the woods faster than you've ever seen it move, and disappears from your sight...
Traveler: It's a great gift!

### Additional Talk 6

Tlamot: Haha, then you'd best take care of the Embercore Flower he gave you, alright?

### Additional Talk 7

Tlamot: I do hope that kid grows up soon — that way, he can just send those Treasure Hoarders flying with a couple of kicks!

### Additional Talk 8

Tlamot: Don't worry, he remembers those who've done right by him. When the time is right, he will definitely come to see us.

### Additional Talk 9

Timid Little Yumkasaur: Been found! Friend! Gift!
Traveler: Thank you!
Timid Little Yumkasaur: Friend, like, happy... See you!
Black Screen Text: The little Yumkasaurus dives into the woods faster than you've ever seen it move, and disappears from your sight...
Traveler: It's a great gift!
