Traveler: Your boss seems like the nice sort.
Tizoc: Yeah, that's just how Ms. Chanca is.
Tizoc: Did you know that she used to be a top-ranking warrior in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame?
Tizoc: But she was forced to retire after seriously injuring her leg in the Night Warden Wars.
Tizoc: Many people used to come here on her reputation's account, but she never liked them making all that fuss.
Tizoc: On that note, I suppose I shouldn't say too much either. All I'll say is, she's a very reliable owner, and this is a great place to come to.
