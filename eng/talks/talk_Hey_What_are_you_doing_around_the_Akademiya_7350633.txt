Lisa: Hey! What are you doing around the Akademiya?
Traveler: Are you on your way into the Akademiya?
Lisa: Actually, I was just leaving.
Lisa: I had a reunion with Professor Cyrus and some fellow apprentices, as well as other researchers that I worked with in the past.
Lisa: How time flies! I could tell just from their appearances that they've been really busy.
Lisa: I, on the other hand, have had it pretty easy. Hahaha... they must be so jealous.
Lisa: That being said, since I've already indulged so much, I should probably eat less cake next month.
Traveler: Oh, so you were on your way out, then?
Lisa: Mm-hmm, and that's when I ran into you.
