Traveler: Tell me about your family.
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": My son is still in Liyue — he runs Hanfeng's Ironmongers now that I've left. I guess the business is his inheritance now.
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": *sigh* It is good that there's someone to take over the shop after I worked so hard to make it what it is... But I do get lonely here, all on my own in my old age.
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": He rarely has the chance to visit, so I don't know how he's doing. The other thing is... He's getting on in age now, too, but all he cares about is his work. Work is important, but he never makes the effort to think about the most important thing of all in life.
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": Oh?
Traveler: Wh—What are you... wondering?
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": #I'm looking at you and I'm thinking to myself, what a fine young {M#man}{F#lady} you are! {M#Handsome}{F#Beautiful} and well-spoken...
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": My son has a strong pair of arms and a gentle demeanor; he knows his way equally well around social events and around the kitchen...
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": If you are heading to Liyue, it can't hurt to pay him a visit, can it? Or maybe you can introduce him to someone?
Traveler: ...I...
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": Hahaha, never mind then, I don't want to make your life difficult. Forgive me. It's just, his mother passed away a long time ago, and as his father I can't help but get a little over-eager to see him settle down and have a family... Hope you can understand.
