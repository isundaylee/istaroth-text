# Missing title (826841519)

Traveler: Deep sea...
Everallin: To be honest, I am not sure if my understanding of the sea's depth is the same as that which human beings sense.
Everallin: All I know is, diving is difficult for most human beings, and requires a heavy set of clothing and a lot of training.
Everallin: Do you know how to dive? It's okay if you don't. I brought these from the sea, and I want to share them with you.
