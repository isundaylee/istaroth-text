Traveler: Diona and Margaret aren't here?
Diane: Yes, Miss Diona's mood tends to sour when Weinlesefest comes around, so Miss Margaret gave her some time off.
Diane: But that's understandable. After all, the number of booze hounds at the wine market far exceeds that which you might find at the tavern.
Diane: As for Miss Margaret, she certainly wouldn't pass up the festivities just to run the business. She's probably off somewhere drinking and having a good time as we speak.
