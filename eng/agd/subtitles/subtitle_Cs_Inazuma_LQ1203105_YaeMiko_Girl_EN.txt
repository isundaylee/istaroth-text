Wow
So many
They're everywhere...
Yes
The memories of the youkai
They haven't been able to relax and soar through the air like this
For a long time
Come with me
You alright, little one?
You look a little nervous
It's just...
Paimon's never seen anything like this before...
Whoa
They've really blocked out the moon!
It does look a little intimidating
Doesn't it
But I know them
They may be loud and brash at times
But they are good and brave souls
Even after losing their lives in a brutal war
They have never given into grief or despair
Alas, their time is short
Do they...
Do they really have to go?
It's a feast
And all feasts come to an end
Hehe
Since you're sorry to see them leave
Why don't you do the recital along with me?
"Oh, Hakushin, cause of this enchantment"
"In reverence I perform this rite"
"In reverence I perform this rite"
"To be a guiding light..."
Wow
So beautiful
Look
Lights are coming from Inazuma City!
The book says
Recite the secret spells of Lady Kitsune tonight
And our wishes will come true...
"Oh, Hakushin, cause of this enchantment"
"I perform this rite, to be a guiding light"
"Your unrivaled power..."
"...will be honored eternally"
Urakusai
You asked if I was doing well
Really, every day is a happy day for me
But watching
You all leave now
I can't help but feel a little lonely
Mmm...
Just a little, of course
