## Talk

Zhenxiang: Please wait while we perform a routine inspection.

## Talk

Traveler: Inspection?
Zhenxiang: Orders have come down from the Qixing. We have to check everyone who comes through here and be on the lookout for suspicious characters.
Zhenxiang: Don't worry, unless there's an issue my Millelith comrade and I will give you no trouble.
Traveler: Why is your comrade slacking off?
Zhenxiang: He isn't slacking off. He's just... recharging.
Zhenxiang: He's in a league of his own in this job â€” he can do face reading! As in, he can tell instantly if you're someone to worry about, just by looking at you. Most I can do is ask a bunch of questions.
Zhenxiang: Thanks to him, it's much safer around here now.
Zhenxiang: I wish I could do what he does...
Traveler: Why are you the only one working?
Zhenxiang: My comrade knows the art of face reading, and he's right on the money every time.
Zhenxiang: He did me a while back. Said that as long as I keep working hard, and help out my comrades when needed, I will go from strength to strength in my career.
Zhenxiang: Covering for him while he takes some time out counts as helping my comrades, right? In which case, I'm definitely on track to do well for myself.

Traveler: Can you let me past?
Zhenxiang: Hmm... Well, you're not on the blacklist, as far as I can see.
Zhenxiang: While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail. Thank you for your cooperation.
