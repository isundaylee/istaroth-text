Tomoki: Absolutely fantastic!
Tomoki: If not for the way you dress, I'd have suspected that you were from Konda Village yourself. It sounded just like the original!
Tomoki: Alright, I've decided. I'm heading to this festival. Maybe immersing myself in the music there might give me some new ideas.
Tomoki: I'll move my food stall over there â€” not that my skills are the most impressive, but I'm sure I'll add to the atmosphere at least, eh?
