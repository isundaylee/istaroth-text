Traveler: About the children...
Nigina: They all went to the Akademiya and became official researchers, too busy to come home more than a couple times a year.
Nigina: So that leaves my old bones here.
Nigina: They have a great future ahead of them, so no complaints from me. I just want to know how they're doing.

Traveler: Kids will grow up.
Nigina: Right, you're right. I trust them to take care of themselves.
Nigina: It's just that I always cook too much when cooking for myself. How about you take some if you don't mind?
Nigina: It's just some common Sumeru dishes. Hope you'll like it.
