# Brook the Carnivore


## Talk 1

Traveler: Do you need some Raw Meat?
Brook: Oh, you must have seen that commission of mine.
Brook: Well, do you have six servings of Raw Meat with you?
Traveler: Of course.
Traveler: Not yet...
Brook: Well, I'll need them to research new recipes, so please pass them to me once you've gathered them all.

## Talk 2

Brook: Oh my, these cuts are very good indeed.
Brook: Thank you very much for your help. Here's a little something in return.
Brook: Come over when I'm done with my research â€” you'll be the first to try my new dish, I promise.
