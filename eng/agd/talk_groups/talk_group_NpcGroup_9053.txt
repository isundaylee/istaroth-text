Traveler: *Do you want to chat?*
Sayu: Sure.
Sayu: I'll try to stay awake...
Traveler: Did you get enough sleep?
Sayu: Now that you ask, I'm getting a little sleepy again...
Sayu: ... *yawn*
Sayu: No, I have to power through it...
Sayu: If I fall asleep while I'm with you... I'll be wasting precious time.
Traveler: What about your work?
Sayu: It's okay...
Sayu: My work is just a bunch of meaningless little chores.
Sayu: It's not as meaningful as staying here.
Sayu: I can sleep, and I can chat with you...
Traveler: If you're sleepy, go lie down.
Sayu: Hmm, I'm okay...
Sayu: *yawn*... I don't want to sleep yet...

Traveler: *Anything you want to do?*
Sayu: If you have the time...
Sayu: Would you like to plant a tree with me?
Traveler: Plant a tree?
Sayu: Yeah, let's plant a big one!
Sayu: Bigger than all those trees outside.
Sayu: I can teach you some ninjutsu using leaves.
Sayu: Oh, and they are all escape techniques...
Sayu: Um, because escaping is very important! Especially when going up against really strong enemies!
Sayu: I don't want to see you get hurt...
Traveler: Then I'll be counting on you to teach me.
Sayu: No problem.
Sayu: After that, we can climb up the tree for a rest.
Sayu: Sitting on the trunk, enjoying the wind...
Sayu: *yawn*... Just thinking about it... makes me a little sleepy.
Traveler: Good night, Sayu.
Sayu: #Likewise, Traveler.
Sayu: *yawn*...I hope I dream of you every time I fall asleep...
Traveler: Sweet dreams, Sayu.

## Talk 10

Sayu: The terrain in this village is pretty complex. I definitely wouldn't get found if I took a nap here.
Sayu: The buildings are just the right height, too. I should be able to practice my escape techniques...
Sayu: Ah, this place is so great...
