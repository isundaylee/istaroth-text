Traveler: Done with work?
Iron Shoulder: Oh? You don't have a job? That won't do...
Iron Shoulder: You should find a job soon, or you might get too used to idling about.
Iron Shoulder: Once you've done work for over a decade like me, you'll slowly begin to understand your place in this world.
Iron Shoulder: You'll understand that you're just a normal person, but a single screw in Rex Lapis' great work. Then you can be considered to have matured.
Iron Shoulder: If not, you'll become like those who roam the streets every day, never having grown out of being children despite their white hair.
