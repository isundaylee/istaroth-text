Grand Rook Sennichi: Hey, which one of you's the ringleader? Step up! It's time to fight.
Grand Rook Sennichi: I am Grand Rook Sennichi, a giant among giants. Grandmaster Hanakado has demanded the head of the Arataki Gang's leader... and I am here to collect it!
Paimon: Whoa, he looks fierce... And sounds it, too! Seems like we're up against a really strong opponent this time...
Arataki Itto: Where do you get off, huh!? And what's the big idea, putting "Grand" in your name? You tryin' to steal my limelight, you little punk?
Arataki Itto: Okay, "giant among giants," time to cut you down to size!
Grand Rook Sennichi: S—So tall! And you're... you're an oni!
Grand Rook Sennichi: Y—You look like you could eat me for breakfast! ...Why is a guy like you into beetle-fighting? It's just a kids' game... Argh, what have I gotten myself into!
Arataki Itto: Uh, excuse me? "Kids' game"? Oh, you did NOT just say that!
Arataki Itto: Seems to me like you don't know the first thing about beetle-fighting. Your misconception begs correctin' by a veteran, my dude!
Traveler: School him!
Paimon: Yeah! Go take him down a notch! You can do it, Bull-Chucker!
Grand Rook Sennichi: Looks like this is happening... Fine, bring it on!
Traveler: This guy's overdue for an attitude adjustment!
