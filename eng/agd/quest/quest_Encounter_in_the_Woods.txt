# Encounter in the Woods


## Talk 1

Arakavi: It's Arama and the Golden Nara. You are so tall. But the silver one by your side...
Paimon: Hmm? What about the silver one?
Arakavi: How should I put it... You must be able to squeeze into the narrowest tree hollows. How convenient!
Arama: #Well, based on Nara customs, we should do introductions first. This is Nara Traveler and Paimon. This is Arakavi. You guys shake hands.
Black Screen Text: You are a little lost, but you shake hands with Arakavi anyway...
You try not to use too much strength.
Arakavu's hand feels... interesting to the touch.
Arakavi: How fascinating. I've heard a lot about Nara before, but this is the first time I've ever touched one. It's a very special feeling!
Arakavi: It's been a long time since we last hosted a Nara here. Many seeds have grown into trees, and many stories have become legends. That Nara was a good Nara â€” or so we've heard.
Arama: #Nara Traveler is good, too. Strong and brave, like a sapling sprouting out of a rock wall. And they are here to help Arana.
Arakavi: Ah, Arana... It's been a while since we last met. I hope all is well, and that the little Nara at Vimara Village are well, too.
Traveler: You know the kids of Vimara Village?
Arakavi: Of course I do!
Arama: We all do! Arana came back and told us stories about the little Nara. Nara Iotham, Nara Bahram, and Narana are our friends.
Paimon: Paimon's not sure that counts as "knowing someone"...
Arakavi: What counts, then? Do we need to "shake hands" after the "introduction" like Nara do?
Arama: I know what Paimon means. Nara eat and look for "treasures" together. Then they know each other, right?
Traveler: It's not quite that simple, either...
Arakavi: As long as we know each other's stories, we know each other. This is because the Aranara's world is a place for songs and dreams.
Arama: #Arakavi is right. As long as we hear about Nara Traveler through songs and see what Nara Traveler looks like through dreams, it'll count as knowing you.
Paimon: Paimon thinks that we can leave this aside for now... After all, we're already friends!
Arama and Arakavi: Good friends!
Traveler: Good friends!
Paimon: Yes. Since we're going to celebrate Festival Utsava, Arakavi needs to make some preparations!
Arakavi: That's true. We need the Bija, right? I've sent Arayasa, Aradasa, and Arasudraka to look for Ashvattha's Concourses.
Paimon: Spot on! But Paimon's wondering... Why don't you guys know where these concourses are?
Arama: Ashvattha's Concourses are very, very sacred places. We don't usually go there. We would prefer to let the Vasara Trees sleep and dream, until all memories come together in Sarva.
Arakavi: The forest will remember. No good thing will ever fade away, and all suffering will come to nourish something beautiful...
Arakavi: Anyway, you can find Arayasa, Aradasa, and Arasudraka looking for Ashvattha's Concourses out there. Arama, you go and help them.
Arama: #I will. If Nara Traveler and Paimon run into us in the forest, we can go adventuring together!
Arakavi: #Very well. Nice to have met you, Nara Traveler and Paimon!
Traveler: Now let's talk about business...
Traveler: How should I explain this...
Traveler: I eat and search for treasures with Paimon.
Paimon: Yes! And we're not just "people who know each other," but the best of companions!
Arama: #Good for you, Nara Traveler, Paimon!

## Talk 2

Arakavi: It was nice to meet you! When Festival Utsava comes, we shall sing together in happiness!
