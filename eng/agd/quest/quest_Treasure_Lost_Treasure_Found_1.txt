# Treasure Lost, Treasure Found


## Talk 1

Soraya: ...How many secrets does Liyue truly hold?

## Talk 2

Traveler: Secrets?
Soraya: Oh, Traveler, it's you. The secrets I'm referring to are a set of inscriptions.

## Talk 3

Soraya: ...How many secrets does Liyue truly hold?

## Talk 4

Soraya: Find anything in the ruins?
Traveler: I found five stone tablets.
Soraya: Great! Let's see... Ugh, these are all over the place. Let me see if I can work out the right order...
Soraya: ...Hmm, there's a lot of missing text here, so it's quite disjointed. Also, I'm still not sure on the order...
Soraya: But anyway, this is my best guess. If I line up like this, it reads as follows:
Soraya: "...In the beginning, when the people assembled to farm the land... A god named Guizhong descended, whose dominion was over Dust, and whose reach shrouded the skies for thousands of miles around..."
Soraya: "...The god laid down four commandments for the people... Then another god descended, whose dominion was over Geo, and who brought the people of Liyue to this place. Jointly they shepherded the people for their protection..."
Soraya: "...And the assembly was named Guili after the names of the two gods..."
Soraya: It seems to be the about history of the Guili Assembly. And of a god with power over dust, who watched over this place.
Soraya: But it also mentions another god who came here at some point, and even brought some of their people with them.
Soraya: Also, it seems to be saying that the name 'Guili,' as in Guili Assembly, came about by taking one syllable each from the names of these two gods.
Soraya: How fascinating. In all the documents I've ever read, I've never come across any mention of two gods who coexisted peacefully... let alone who actively worked together...
Soraya: It seems they were more than just two allied gods — they were best friends.
Soraya: But what happened to them? They can't have just... disappeared?
Soraya: And how was the Guili Assembly laid to waste so completely? With two gods watching over it, no disaster should have been quite so devastating. Natural or otherwise.
Soraya: Which means that whatever happened was beyond even the gods' power to withstand...
Soraya: Traveler, could you keep looking for more clues? Unless I'm mistaken, there should be more stone tablets around here, just like the ones you have seen already.
Soraya: Maybe they will tell the story of what happened next...
Soraya: That which is recorded on these stone tablets seems to differ in some places from those in some documents.
Soraya: *sigh* So many legends, so many tellings... Which of these is the truth, I wonder...

## Talk 5

Soraya: *sigh* So many legends, so many tellings... Which of these is the truth, I wonder...

## Talk 6

Soraya: Ah, you're back. I was starting to wonder how much longer I'd have to wait. Found anything?
Traveler: Two more stone tablets.
Soraya: Ooh, let me see!
Soraya: "...and there they fought upon the Guili Plains, where black dust choked the heavens and a thousand rocks splintered..."
Soraya: Oh my... It appears to be saying that a battle once took place on the Guili Plains. And an enormous battle at that...
Soraya: That must have been the battle in which the Guili Assembly fell. But as for this other passage...
Soraya: ...It seems to have been written by someone who couldn't bring themselves to leave their home. So they stayed here. And what's more...
Traveler: ...There's treasure.
Soraya: ...Clearly you have a fondness for treasure. But you're not wrong, there is indeed treasure in the Guili Plains if this passage is to be taken literally.
Soraya: But then we have... "Guizhong's Four Commandments shall guide those in generations to come who aspire to find it," followed by:
Soraya: "Teach with wisdom, be bound by virtue, fortify the bones, unite in ambition — the convergence of these four shall be known as the 'Guili Assembly.'"
Soraya: How does one decipher that? I wouldn't know where to start.
Soraya: Let's head back to Wangshu Inn. I think we all need some downtime before we try to tackle the riddle of Guizhong's Four Commandments.
