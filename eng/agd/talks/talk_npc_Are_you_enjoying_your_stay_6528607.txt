Traveler: Are you enjoying your stay?
Nacker: Of course. Here, I don't have to ponder over complex technical issues or constantly be forced to recall each and every step of painfully precise operations.

Nacker: Based on those few facets alone, the Fortress of Meropide is vastly preferable to the Fontaine Research Institute.
Nacker: Oh, and I noticed that Jurieu fellow managed to build the Wingalet. He does seem to have some talent.
Nacker: Mr. Edwin's assistant has completed a significant undertaking, while Edwin himself remains where he started, empty-handed and frustrated.
Nacker: Hahahahaha! Serves you right, Edwin!
