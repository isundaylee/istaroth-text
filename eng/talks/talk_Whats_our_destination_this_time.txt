Traveler: What's our destination this time?
Aeval: Right. Our destination is Romaritime Station, which is also Romaritime Harbor â€” which is the end of a large waterfall!
Aeval: And opposite that big waterfall... Well, that's a big desert! Uh, is that where you want to go, dear passenger? That's... super amazing!
