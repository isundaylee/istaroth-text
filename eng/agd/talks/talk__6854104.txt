Messenger: Madam Faruzan! Letters from the students!
Faruzan: Oh? They've finally decided to enroll? Let me see!
Earnest Letter-Writer: "Thank you for your invitation, Madam Faruzan. I've given this a lot of thought, and in the end, I think I'm gonna focus on Kshahrewar!"
Respectful Letter-Writer: "Sorry, Madam Faruzan, while I'm very interested in mechanisms and ancient texts, I'm stretched thin as it is. I need to focus on my other classes..."
Faruzan: Focus, huh...
Collei: "I'm sorry, Madam Faruzan, but I wanna study with Master for a little bit longer..."
Faruzan: *sigh* Seems like everyone's focused on themselves these days...
Faruzan: ...
Faruzan: ...But it's good to have a focus.
Cyno: Hey, folks. Don't place all your yolks in the same punnet. Broaden your horizons today, and find a new locus for your focus.
