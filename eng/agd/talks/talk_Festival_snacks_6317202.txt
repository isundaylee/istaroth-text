Traveler: Festival snacks...
Murakami: Ha, though we called them festival snacks, they really are no different from ordinary dishes. The difference lies in the wrappings.
Murakami: It's just as delicious, though! Besides, food you eat at festivals always feel a little more special somehow, don't they?
Murakami: Either way, my shop is always open whether there's an event on or not. You're welcome to come and stuff your face if you ever get hungry.
