Traveler: Aren't you thinking about hiring more people?
Chaussivert: Yes... I'm seriously considering that, and discussing with Lemarcq.
Chaussivert: However... Haha, maybe that shameless Pattyn was right. You won't make a fortune by working with me. I doubt many people would want to get involved.
Chaussivert: But no matter what, I won't take dirty money. Otherwise... I wouldn't be able to sleep at night.
