Traveler: I'm just passing by.
Baiwen: Is that so? How fascinating...
Baiwen: I find it hard to believe that you came here for leisure alone.
Baiwen: Our intel indicates that no one comes to the Jade Chamber without good reason. This rule has yet to see exception.
Baiwen: But make no mistake, we will ascertain your motivations whether or not you are forthcoming with them, and they will enter our records in due course. Do not underestimate our intelligence network.
