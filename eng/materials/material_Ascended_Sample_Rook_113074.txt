# Ascended Sample: Rook

A rare sample resulting from the alchemical activation of a substance.
The name of this piece derives from the word for the "Chariot" in the ancient language of Sumeru. In divination, the Chariot card is depicted with two heavenly steeds — one black and one white — symbolizing the alchemical principle of balancing opposing properties.
