Traveler: So, about those tales...
Xu Liushi: You ever hear the name Third-Round Knockout?
Xu Liushi: That place used to be some no-name watering hole. The specialty there was the wine-fermented sweet rice balls, but they were waxy and soft, and the wine was all there was to the soup...
Xu Liushi: I was young then, and I'd lost a bet with some folks. I had three bowls in a row... and got so plastered that I fell off the ship and into the sea, right as we were weighing anchor.
Xu Liushi: That incident gave the pub its name, Third-Round Knockout. It also lost me my job.
Xu Liushi: No one wanted a sailor too deep into his bottle â€” only Captain Beidou was willing to give me a chance to turn over a new leaf.
Xu Liushi: ...And that's how it happened. I hope my story can serve as a lesson to you, traveler.
