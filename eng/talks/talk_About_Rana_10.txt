Traveler: About Rana...
Iotham: #Thank you, {NICKNAME}. It's all thanks to you that Rana wakes up again...
Iotham: I'll be a good boy for grandma, the village chief, and Rana, from now on. I won't try to explore the dangerous places in the forest.
Iotham: I'll grow up to be a great man, and go look for Rana and Arana!
