# "The Sea's Silent Shade"

Specialized refinement material for the "Ash-Graven Drinking Horn."
The fine and warm colored sand has a texture as gentle as the sea breeze at sunset.
According to an ancient Meztli legend, the sea is the stars' home, and the sinking starlight will eventually turn into pale ocean sand. Listen quietly, then, to the swaying whispers of the stars and the tides within the bottle.
