# Jade Fruit Soup

A traditional Liyue dessert. The water is brought to boil, various ingredients are added in, and then it is simmered for some time before rock sugar is added. The liquid mixture is then simmered until clear and thick. The lengthy simmering creates a soup with a gentle mouthfeel, causing the ingredients to melt with just a light sip. Suitable for all ages.
