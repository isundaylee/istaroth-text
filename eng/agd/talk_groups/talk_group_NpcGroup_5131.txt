Sonny: ...You're right, dear Luca. I do hope that such a regrettable incident won't happen again.
Luca: ...
Sonny: Why, if it isn't our good friend! What a coincidence, bumping into you! How have you been?

Traveler: How've things been for you?
Sonny: I hope you're right! While there's always something unpleasant to deal with, as we say in Fontaine, "that's life."
Sonny: Don't you think so, dear Luca?
Luca: Life? Hmph!
Sonny: You see? Luca's wit is as electrifying as ever. I'm overjoyed to hear him answer your question so concisely.

Traveler: See you.

Luca: See you.

Traveler: About Virgil...
Sonny: Right, are you interested in fishing? In Fontaine, there are all sorts of fish that make fishing truly rewarding. Am I right, my dear Luca?
Luca: ...
Sonny: #*sigh* Shame, he seems to have his own more...tedious pursuits. Still, I am certain that you understand. Am I right, my dear Traveler?
Sonny: Here's some fresh catch. Please take it. I am sorry to interrupt you, it's just that I really wanted to share this... novel fun of exercising with you.
