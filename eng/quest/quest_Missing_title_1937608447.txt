## Talk 1

Traveler: The Golden Roses have sprouted into seedlings, yes.
Affan: These seeds... Where did you even find these seeds, I wonder?
Traveler: From a far-off place.
Affan: Did you indeed? Well, I suppose that the seeds Uncle Shafaqat sowed really did find their way back here in the end after being spread to every corner of the desert — even if the path they took meandered quite a bit.
Affan: We'll have to take good care of these seedlings — I intend to leave them to young Sabbah. Once I, too, am gone, these flowers shall pass on to her.
Affan: Thank you, child. There is little I can give you... but please accept these fruits and flowers.

Affan: You've truly helped this old man out, and you asked for no reward — but ah, I would have trouble sleeping tonight if I didn't give you a little something at least.
Affan: This seedling recently broke through the soil, and Sabbah suggested giving it to you. She even wrapped it up nicely.
Affan: Take it as a memento from us. May you be as resilient as this seedling, and may you always keep the faith.

Affan: ♪ ... Ah. It's you. Come, come. These flowers are growing well, are they not?

### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: So, about the folk song...
Affan: Ah, so you've remembered it, eh? Well, that makes one more young person who knows it. Good, good.
Affan: "Rose, oh rose, grant me my wish. Blooming from the stone, the Golden Rose sang to me."
Affan: "No land but folk songs bore my spirit. Songs shall defy my fate, and overcome my destiny."
Affan: "They will surpass me, surpass time. They will surpass the ever-lasting withering of life..."

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: See you.
Affan: You have a good heart, child. May the gods watch over you and that heart of yours. See you.
