## Talk 1

Madame Ping: That's weird...
Traveler: Granny, what's wrong?
Madame Ping: Oh, it's you two again. I was just sorting out my teapot.
Madame Ping: After you helped clean my teapot last time, I thought to myself, I really ought to give it a proper deep clean.
Madame Ping: It would make things so much easier when I wish to treat my guests to tea in the future.
Madame Ping: So I took it down to the Bishui River and gave it a good old wash, inside and out. But it was no use. This teapot is so dreadfully difficult to clean.
Madame Ping: Youngsters, would you help an old lady clean her teapot once more? For old time's sake?

Madame Ping: One can't very well brew tea with it in this state...

Traveler: My clothes are soaked through...
Madame Ping: I'm terribly sorry, children, how absent-minded of me. I had thought there was only a little water inside.
Madame Ping: At least this teapot is more or less clean now. There are a few final nooks and crannies to attend to, but all in good time.
Paimon: Granny, did you put the whole Bishui River in there or something!?
Madame Ping: Foolish child, I wouldn't dream of doing such a thing â€” wherever would the poor city folks draw their water from if I did that? No, I was careful to use only half of the river's water.
Madame Ping: Sorry for causing you a little spot of bother on this occasion. Please accept these as thanks for your help.
Madame Ping: Oh, and I mustn't forget to return the water from the teapot back to the river some time...
Traveler: Should be spick and span in there by now.
Madame Ping: Well, mostly. There are still a few nooks and crannies, mind you, that one shall have to get inside and clean out.

## Talk 5

Traveler: Leave it to us.
Madame Ping: Wonderful, thank you, youngsters.

## Talk 6

Traveler: Sorry, I have other things to do.
Madame Ping: Very well, never mind. You must have far more important things to attend to than helping an old lady with her spring cleaning.
