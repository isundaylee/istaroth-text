# Theater Mechanicus


## Talk 1

Komakata: Come, try your hand at Theater Mechanicus!
Traveler: What is it?
Komakata: Wâ€”Welcome! I am a local representative for this new game from Liyue. It's called Theater Mechanicus!
Komakata: In short, it is a game that can be played on a board. It was first invented by Ms. Ruijin from Liyue.
Komakata: Well, according to Ms. Ruijin, I am one of their overseas agents.
Komakata: After I obtained... umm... the distribution rights, Ms. Ruijin sent me a complete set of Theater Mechanicus and the business model that goes with it.
Komakata: Although it initially got confiscated by the Outlander Affairs Agency... It took me a while to get this copy of the game back.
Traveler: Why did the Outlander Affairs Agency confiscate this...
Komakata: They'll confiscate anything from overseas...
Komakata: Anyway. Let's not talk about this.
Komakata: Do you see these things laid out on the table here? These are all important items used in Theater Mechanicus.
Komakata: Does it feel like Liyue? Hahaha, this version was tailor-made according to the descriptions in Ms. Ruijin's letter.
Komakata: I even had someone make this table... It cost me a fortune.
Komakata: And per Ms. Ruijin's suggestions, I added new features to Theater Mechanicus.
Komakata: Well... Anyway, it's better to learn through practice. Why don't you just give it a go? You'll understand after you play it.
Traveler: Play Theater Mechanicus.
Komakata: Sure thing! Enjoy the brand-new version of Theater Mechanicus! You won't be disappointed!
Traveler: I don't have time...
Komakata: Well, try it when you're free next time.
Traveler: How come there's Theater Mechanicus here...
Komakata: Welcome... Huh? So you know Theater Mechanicus?
Komakata: Ah... I see. You must've played it in Liyue before.
Komakata: Ms. Ruijin told me that she promoted the game during the Lantern Rite... So it did work after all.
Komakata: Well, according to Ms. Ruijin, I'm a local representative of Theater Mechanicus in Inazuma.

Traveler: What's Theater Mechanicus?
Komakata: In short, it is a game that can be played on a board. It was first invented by Ms. Ruijin from Liyue.
Komakata: Well, according to Ms. Ruijin, I'm a local representative of Theater Mechanicus in Inazuma.
Komakata: After I obtained... umm... the distribution rights, Ms. Ruijin sent me a complete set of Theater Mechanicus and the business model that goes with it.
Komakata: According to Ms. Ruijin, I am not her only overseas distributor. She must've made a lot of money from the distribution fees...
Komakata: However, I've prepared a brand-new gameplay. Maybe it'll be even better than Ms. Ruijin's original version of Theater Mechanicus... Ahem...
Komakata: *sigh* Ms. Ruijin really does have a good business sense. If only I could be like her...
Traveler: I don't have time...
Komakata: Well, come back later when you have the time.
