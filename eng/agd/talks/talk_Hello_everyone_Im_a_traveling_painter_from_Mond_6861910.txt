Claricia's Message: "Hello everyone! I'm a traveling painter from Mondstadt. Does anyone have any paint recommendations â€” you know, the kind that gives that gilded golden finish... I hear it's called phlogiston or something?"
Someone's Message: "Phlogiston engraving, eh... It's not enough to have the paint for that. There's also a special brush you'll need to buy. I personally recommend a brush made of Qucusaurus feathers. It's durable and cheap."
Claricia's Message: "Okay! I'll go get a brush!"
Another Person's Message: "Just buying a brush isn't enough either. What are you going to use to store the phlogiston? This stuff won't last very long without a receptacle..."
Someone's Message: "That's a good point. The palette will also need to be crafted from special materials..."
Claricia's Message: "Okay, thank you, everyone! I bought all the stuff. So... What about the paint? What kind of paint should I buy?
