## Talk 2

Siyu: I suppose I should give him a Xiao Lantern after all...
Traveler: Give who a Xiao Lantern?
Siyu: Oh, Traveler, it's you. Well, "The Wrench" has always taken good care of me. Even now, he helps me out all the time — he's almost like a real brother to me.
Siyu: This is supposed to be a festival, and yet he's still working non-stop...
Siyu: So, I'd like to give him a Xiao Lantern as a gift. Hehe, we were childhood playmates, and he absolutely loved the sight of the lanterns when he was little.
Siyu: I'm sure he'd love to get one now. Traveler, could you help me deliver this Xiao Lantern to him?
Traveler: Don't you want to give it to him yourself?
Siyu: I'd love to, but I've still got so many things to take care of at home...
Siyu: I've left my husband to do all the housework while I've been out shopping. I should get back to help him out as soon as I can.
Siyu: So I'm leaving the matter of the Xiao Lantern to you. Once we've got some time, my husband and I will go see "The Wrench" together.
Siyu: I do hope that he'll manage to get a little more free time...
Traveler: It might mean more coming from you...

## Talk 3

Wrench Wang: Hmm? Do you have some business with me, Traveler? I'm quite busy at the moment.
Traveler: Here's a Xiao Lantern from Siyu...

## Talk 4

Wrench Wang: Siyu? She... she got me a Xiao Lantern? L—Let me see!
Wrench Wang: Hahaha, she wrote this wish for me, didn't she? Yep, that was my greatest wish as a kid...
Wrench Wang: So many years have passed in the blink of an eye. Time truly flies...
Wrench Wang: Still, how come she asked you to deliver it to me?
Traveler: She has things to attend to at home...
Wrench Wang: Ah, is that so... Good, good. Yes. Very good.
Wrench Wang: Sounds like she's got a good life now. That's all that matters... Haha... Heh.
Wrench Wang: It's a good thing. It's very good... I'm sorry, I've still got a lot of work to do. If you'll please excuse me...
Traveler: She needs to return home to help her husband...

## Talk 5

Hammer Li: That Xiao Lantern was from Siyu, wasn't it?
Traveler: You overheard us?
Hammer Li: Hah, I just know him well enough. There was no need to even guess.
Hammer Li: He did exactly the same thing last year. Went off for a walk, then came right back and proceeded to hammer nails into a ship's hull the whole night through.
Hammer Li: I know why he does this, but still... *sigh*
Hammer Li: Traveler, could you please go help him out? Tormenting oneself is no way to spend a festival...
Traveler: I'll do it...
Hammer Li: *sigh* Sorry for troubling you.
Hammer Li: I bet he's onboard a ship right now, working away... Best you go find him quick.
Hammer Li: I'll be preparing some food in a bit. Come back here once you're done and we'll eat together.
Traveler: How did you know?

## Talk 6

Wrench Wang: We've dallied so long, I'm sure we've fallen behind on work. Best we put our backs into it.
Traveler: Y—You sure you're alright?
Wrench Wang: Hey! What are you trying to say? I'm fine! Why wouldn't I be?
Wrench Wang: I should get back to work now. Once I've finished... *sigh* Well, I'll see.
Traveler: Allow me to help.
Wrench Wang: Hmm? ...Well, if you really want to, you can bring me some wooden planks.

## Talk 7

Wrench Wang: Have you brought the planks?

## Talk 8

Wrench Wang: Mm, these should do the trick. Many thanks.
Wrench Wang: There's still a few loose ends to tie up. Could I trouble you to go to the dock and take inventory of some newly arrived goods?
Wrench Wang: There should be a total of three crates piled up at the dock.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Wrench Wang: You're a big help. In the meantime, I need to get a move on and finish up everything here...

## Talk 9

Wrench Wang: Have you tallied the numbers up?
Traveler: All done.
Wrench Wang: Thank you very much!
Wrench Wang: Well then! That's today's urgent work dealt with.
Traveler: Hammer Li says he's got some food prepped for you.
Wrench Wang: Huh? Does he, now? ...That guy worries too much.
Wrench Wang: Well, whatever. Since he's already gone to the trouble of making it, let's go and join him.
Wrench Wang: Besides, you helped me out a lot too, so some of that should go to you as compensation.

## Talk 10

Wrench Wang: It's done. I hope I didn't keep you waiting.
Hammer Li: Oh, you've finished everything?
Wrench Wang: Aye. It was a small matter, and with this traveler helping, it was easy.
Hammer Li: You... *sigh*
Wrench Wang: Oh, come on. It's the festive season, no need for the long face.
Hammer Li: Yes, sure, whatever you say. Have you prepared a Xiao Lantern yet?
Wrench Wang: A Xiao Lantern... Ugh, I forgot! What's with my memory today...
Wrench Wang: Ah well, never mind, eh? It's just a lantern. So what if we don't release one this time?
Hammer Li: Hah, don't you try that with me. You're not seriously suggesting that we celebrate the Lantern Rite without a lantern, now, are you?
Hammer Li: Traveler, could you make a lantern for my colleague ?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Hammer Li: Thank you very much. We'll be waiting for you here.

## Talk 11

Hammer Li: Did you bring the Xiao Lantern?
Traveler: Got it right here, sir.

## Talk 12

Hammer Li: That will do. Thank you.
Wrench Wang: You've really done a lot, Traveler, and during the festive period, too...
Wrench Wang: Well then, what should I wish for...
Wrench Wang: Hmm, let's go with this: "New year, new horizons!"
Traveler: Sounds good.
Wrench Wang: You think so? Hahaha, that's good... Ah, I do wish that it would come true...
Hammer Li: *sigh*
Traveler: What's wrong?
Hammer Li: He made the same wish last year as well...
Traveler: A fine wish.
