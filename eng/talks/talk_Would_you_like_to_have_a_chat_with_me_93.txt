Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Layla: Sure, that would be nice.
Layla: Hmm, lemme think about what would be interesting for you... Ah, I know!
Layla: The Sighing Spirit of the Laboratory... ever heard of it?
Traveler: What's that?
Layla: Hehe, so there are *some* things you don't know then.
Layla: Okay, so get this: There's this creepy laboratory in our institute where strange things happen.
Layla: Several people say that when they've walked by that lab at night, they heard the sound of someone sighing inside.
Layla: But then, when they opened the door to check, the room was completely dark and there was nobody inside.
Layla: Weird stuff like this happens a couple of times a week. And it's bad luck for the one who hears it: It means you'll flunk your next exam.
Traveler: Seriously?
Layla: Huh? You don't believe it? Just ask my classmates, almost everyone will tell you the same.
Layla: And even the ones who don't believe it still go out of their way to avoid that place.
Layla: Nobody wants to risk failing their exams, you know.
Traveler: Sounds a little superstitious to me...
