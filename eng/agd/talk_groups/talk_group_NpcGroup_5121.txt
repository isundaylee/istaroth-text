Hinterman: That said, a nice client of mine told me of a place around here that produces Condessence Crystals and asked if I needed some to reinforce my fishing boat.
Hinterman: I don't need any right now, but it'd be a shame to not put them to good use. If you're interested, perhaps you can go have a look around here, eh?
