# Candidature Analysis


## Talk 1

Bolai: Look, your asking price for this batch is just too high. I can't buy in at this price. How am I supposed to turn a profit?
Qiping: Come on, hear me out. I'm telling you, this is the single best batch of Sunsettias ever. You won't find anyone who disputes that.
Qiping: I accidentally dropped one into a well, and even the water turned sweet!
Bolai: Even so...
Qiping: Shhh, alright, alright, I'll let you in on a little secret. The boss of Second Life also wants to buy from me, but I haven't responded yet.
Qiping: If you won't take them, I'll just have to partner with them instead, and neither of us wants that.
Bolai: Okay, well, when you put it that way... I'll accept your asking price. I'll take all your stock. Don't sell a single one to Second Life!
Black Screen Text: The trader who was negotiating with Bolai leaves...
Bolai: Oh, what are you doing here?
Bolai: And to be clear, these Sunsettias are mine. I got to them first, don't get any ideas!
Traveler: Knock yourself out...
Paimon: Actually, we want to ask you about a guy called Zhiyi. Have you heard of him before?
Bolai: Zhiyi? Yes, he's quite well-known.
Bolai: I've heard a story about him. They say he was born into poverty, his parents died when he was young, and he was treated cruelly by the local community.
Bolai: One of his neighbors was terribly rude to him all the time, but Zhiyi never retaliated — and when his neighbor went bankrupt, he even helped support the family.
Bolai: He returned cruelty with kindness, injustice with peace offerings... A gentleman of talent and character and— Oh... how did I not notice him sooner? In fact, maybe I'm not too late. If I could hire him to be the brand ambassador for Wanyou Boutique...
Paimon: He sounds like a decent man! We can finally breathe a sigh of relief!
Bolai: Why are you asking about him, anyway? You aren't... looking for a brand ambassador too, are you?
Bolai: Well then, in that case, the higher bidder takes the... Hmm? Ah, that's Zhiyi right over there. Why don't we go and talk to him?
Paimon: Where, where?
Yelan: #It's him alright. Looks like he's chatting with Linlang, Traveler... Come on, let's follow them and listen in.
Yelan: Try not to let him see you. We want this information to be as truthful as possible.
Bolai: I'll just go and fetch an employment contract... And hey, don't try and cut me out of this! Heeey!
Traveler: I've got more than enough in my bag...

## Talk 2

Yelan: What's the hurry? Don't get too close, or he'll see you.

## Talk 3

Yelan: This is the Blackcliff Forge.
Yelan: Let's look around for clues.

## Talk 4

Paimon: They went thataway! Hurry, we gotta catch up!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Huh... These footprints are heading towards Liyue Harbor. Maybe we were wrong about them?

## Talk 6

Yelan: Just as I thought. They didn't go to Liyue Harbor — they went that way.

## Talk 7

Yelan: Zhiyi's manifesto covers a huge range of topics. Looking for details that don't add up will be like trying to find a needle in a haystack.
Yelan: I'll divide the reports into two piles. You take one, I'll take the other. When we're finished, we'll put our heads together.
Yelan: Officially, the assessment is already over, and I'll be expected to announce the results before long. So we have to get to the bottom of this as quickly as we can.
Paimon: Yikes! We'd better hurry.
Yelan: Whatever else Uncle Tian might think of Zhiyi, the fact remains that he's one of his favorite students.
Yelan: Any evidence he's left is not going to be immediately obvious. We'll have to look carefully, and think critically.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Whew... Even though Yelan took half, this is still a lot to get through...
Paimon: Well, we gotta start somewhere.

## Talk 9

Shanghua: Aha, looks like I'm the first one back, as usual.
Paimon: Oh, hey, it's one of Yelan's little helpers, Shanghua!
Paimon: If you're back, that means... that means you've finished investigating Qianwei, right?
Shanghua: You betcha. I visited all the commerce guilds and gathered a wealth of information. Every time they asked me to leave, but I always had another trick up my sleeve...
Yelan: Don't drag this out. Just tell us your findings.
Shanghua: Yes, Lady Yelan.
Shanghua: To summarize my findings, most people who've had interactions with Qianwei will start out complaining about how proud and arrogant he is, but then go on to give a generally positive appraisal of him.
Shanghua: The young master of the Feiyun Commerce Guild said that Qianwei appears arrogant, but he's very scrupulous in the way he works.
Shanghua: Once he signs a contract with somebody, he treats them fairly regardless of their background.
Paimon: Who'd have thought!
Yelan: Is it possible that his reputation is fake? Is there any way you can check the accounts of the businesses under his name?
Shanghua: In theory, that should be very difficult. But here's the thing... I asked around and found out that almost all of Qianwei's accounts are open to the public.
Shanghua: Where he buys from and sells to should be confidential business information, but he doesn't seem interested in protecting it at all.
Shanghua: Qianwei often sees business opportunities that others don't. But once he's made enough Mora off of it, it's like he gets sick of it and releases all of his trade secrets.
Shanghua: It's like he wants people to know that they still can't beat him even if he shares all of his secrets. The fact that someone like that can still make Mora is pretty infuriating when you think about it!
Paimon: What a strange guy. It's like he's not doing business to make Mora, but instead...
Yelan: To validate his theories. No wonder his manifesto contains so many insights — it's all the result of his firsthand experimentation.
Wenyuan: I'm back... Huh? How come you're here?
Shanghua: Why do you think? Obviously, because I possess superior skills and am always one step ahead of the competition... Well, when you're the competition, at least.
Wenyuan: You... Whatever, I'm not getting into an argument with you. If I hadn't had something else to take care of on the way, I would've been back long before you.
Wenyuan: Lady Yelan, I have finished investigating Mingbo.
Yelan: Well, we're all ears.
Wenyuan: The Ministry of Civil Affairs says that Mingbo struggles to get his words out when he gets nervous, especially when he's chatting with strangers.
Wenyuan: But after a few days of getting to know him, you can pretty much have a normal conversation with him. On the whole, the feedback from the Ministry of Civil Affairs was very positive. He always considers the things that everyone else overlooks.
Yelan: In your opinion, was the Ministry of Civil Affairs' appraisal of Mingbo at all exaggerated?
Wenyuan: I don't believe so. Mingbo is someone who has slowly but surely earned the reputation he has today.
Wenyuan: According to Ms. Yu, the Ministry often gets Mingbo to take a final look at projects before they're implemented. People feel much more confident in something if it has his stamp of approval.
Wenyuan: Oh, and also, there was once someone in the Ministry who was lying and cheating to try to advance their career. Mingbo gave them the scolding of a lifetime. Apparently, he can be terrifying when he loses his temper... I haven't seen it for myself though.
Paimon: Whoa... That's hard to imagine...
Yelan: Like I said before: Things are not always as they appear.
Paimon: Ah, so that's what you meant by that. Paimon's starting to get it now...
Yelan: Thank you both. You're free to go now.
Yelan: #So, have you finished reading the manifesto, Traveler?
Paimon: We still have a bit left, hehe.
Black Screen Text: You finish reading the manifesto with Yelan.
Yelan: Hmm... I can't see any immediate problems looking at the individual entries.
Yelan: The only one that strikes me as a little unusual is the Qingxu Pool Redevelopment Plan.
Traveler: What's that?
Yelan: Qingxu Pool has always been home to many secrets. Plus, Azhdaha once wrought havoc there, so there are even more secrets buried deep underground.
Yelan: At some point, a rumor began to go around that there is great treasure buried beneath Qingxu Pool.
Yelan: A long time ago, with the approval of the Qixing, a mining team conducted an exploratory excavation there.
Paimon: So... did they find any treasure?
Yelan: None. The ruin was completely impenetrable. The only way they could have gotten through the solid rock would've been by blowing it open with a special kind of explosive.
Yelan: The technology wasn't mature enough at that time, so the excavation project was shut down, and the "treasure" became a mere legend.
Yelan: Zhiyi's manifesto focuses on solving problems, and this treasure hunt seems extremely risky. It seems out of step with the rest of his plans.
Yelan: Still, this one fact alone doesn't tell us much. Everyone wants to get their hands on this treasure — the Treasure Hoarders, the Fatui, even local Liyue factions...
Yelan: Did you find anything?
Paimon: #"Excavation," "project," "treasure"... Did we read anything similar in our half of the manifesto, Traveler?
Traveler: The Blackcliff Forge...
Paimon: Oh yeah! Zhiyi said the Blackcliff Forge workers should get right of first refusal if any suitable projects come up!
Yelan: Did he now? Well, that makes everything much clearer... So Zhiyi wants the Blackcliff Forge to excavate the treasure of Qingxu Pool.
Paimon: Does that mean the Blackcliff Forge is Zhiyi's secret supporter?
Yelan: No, not likely. I've looked into the Blackcliff Forge before. They aren't involved with any powerful factions at present.
Yelan: They do possess some specialized explosives, but it would seem more trouble than it's worth to put so many resources into a risky project like this.
Yelan: Still, since the clues are pointing toward the Blackcliff Forge, we should see where they lead. We may well find something new.
Traveler: The "Rock" chapter.

## Talk 10

Paimon: Sooooo... anything strange been going on recently?
Iron Shoulder: ...Excuse me? What's that supposed to mean, strange how?
Paimon: Uhhh... just... y'know, stuff that when it happens, you think to yourself: "That was weird!"
Iron Shoulder: ?
Yelan: I don't think we're going to get anywhere asking questions like that. Let's just take a look around.

## Talk 11

Paimon: What's this? A diary?
Yelan: From the back, it looks like a ledger. But it seems they also use it as a site log.
Yelan: We don't know who wrote it, but it's interesting, don't you think? These newcomers... Who could have sent them?
Paimon: You think they're suspicious?
Yelan: Yes. Look, it says right there: one of them's already been promoted to team leader.
Yelan: At this rate, by the time the Qingxu Pool Redevelopment Plan is ready to roll, they'll be the technical backbone of the team.
Yelan: That'll give them the chance to take a lot of liberties... They can copy any secret texts or steal any treasure they find underground.
Yelan: Imagine if we didn't suspect anything. By the time Zhiyi recommends the Blackcliff Forge for the excavation project, at most we would maybe do a fresh background check on the place.
Yelan: No red flags if all they did was change some key staff. And even if we decided to vet the staff individually, they'd have had more than enough time by then to come up with fake identities.
Yelan: That's the advantage of planning this far in advance... It was a clever move.
Paimon: When you put it like that, it all makes sense... If we hadn't found this out, someone else would've stolen the treasure!
Paimon: So who's really behind all this?
Yelan: That's a question for the newcomers. But let's start with that worker over there for now.

## Talk 12

Paimon: Uh, excuse us... We wanna ask you about the newcomers!
Iron Shoulder: *sigh* You want them to teach you or something?
Iron Shoulder: I gotta say, these newcomers are in tip-top shape. Fast learners, too. They're picking up all the skills unbelievably fast.
Iron Shoulder: My only complaint is that they're always going out drinking at night, but they never let us join them.
Iron Shoulder: I guess they just need some time to adjust. I'm sure we'll get to know each other over time.
Yelan: They go out drinking? This area isn't exactly renowned for the nightlife. I'm guessing it's a long trip to the nearest tavern?
Iron Shoulder: You got that right. They tell me they go all the way back to Liyue Harbor to drink at Wanmin Restaurant.
Iron Shoulder: It rained after work today, so they actually stuck around at the site for a while. But as soon as the rain stopped, they went out drinking again right away.
Iron Shoulder: Hey, you're only young once, right? I say, if they can hack it, let 'em at it, haha.
Yelan: #Interesting. Let's go talk somewhere else, Traveler.
Black Screen Text: Yelan takes you to a quieter place...
Yelan: Looks like our hunch was on the Mora. These newcomers are very suspicious.
Yelan: Drinking in Liyue Harbor, huh? Some cover story. I'll wager they've been going to intelligence updates...
Yelan: Good thing it rained today — it means they'll leave footprints... I doubt they'd give themselves away that easily, but let's follow them and try our luck.

## Talk 13

Yelan: The footprints stop here.
Yelan: But judging from the direction, I'm guessing their destination was that abandoned house.

## Talk 14

Traveler (Strange Traces): (It looks like there may have been a fight here, but it's hard to say for certain.)
Traveler (Strange Traces): (This was the work of a professional... but who?)

## Talk 15

Traveler (Fruit Pit): (A fresh fruit pit. Someone was here recently.)
Traveler (Fruit Pit): (There don't seem to be any more clues.)

## Talk 16

Traveler (Compacted Mud): (These stripes in the dirt were likely made by a bamboo mat. That means someone slept here.)
Traveler (Compacted Mud): (But the bamboo mat is nowhere to be seen now.)

## Talk 17

Traveler (Burned-Out Fire): (A fire that burned out. Something was burned here not long ago.)

## Talk 18

Traveler (Pile of Leaves): (You find a fresh fruit pit in the pile of leaves.)
Traveler (Pile of Leaves): (It seems like someone was here recently, but you can't find any more clues.)

## Talk 19

Yelan: Looks like we were too late.
Yelan: This has gotta be where the newcomers rendezvous with whoever they're working for. But all the evidence has been destroyed.
Yelan: Look at these ashes. Someone was burning documents not long before we arrived.
Paimon: Could there be anything left? Maybe the wind could've blown the fire out before everything was finished burning?
Yelan: The odds of that are very slim. It's practically impossible. I've checked — all the paper's been burned. There's only ash left now.
Paimon: Why don't we wait for them back at the Blackcliff Forge? They've gotta go back there sooner or later.
Yelan: We can't count on that. Clearly, they were based here at one point, but it's mysteriously abandoned now.
Yelan: To me, that says that whoever's behind this has moved them somewhere else to throw our investigation off course.
Paimon: Darn... Guess this is where our trail runs cold!
Yelan: Make no mistake, the purpose of our trip wasn't to find any solid evidence. We just need to figure out who's behind Zhiyi.
Yelan: I smelled something peculiar the moment I came in.
Yelan: Those newcomers probably thought they'd be safe as long as they burned the letters. But what they failed to consider is that paper and ink from different regions produce different odors when they're burned.
Paimon: #Really? *sniff* Paimon can't smell anything! Do you smell anything, Traveler?
Traveler: I smell a very gentle fragrance.
Yelan: There is a certain place with a freezing-cold climate where there's nothing but ice as far as the eye can see.
Yelan: Some wealthy people there put floral fragrance in their ink as a way of injecting a little romance into their writing.
Yelan: When that fragrant ink is burned, this is the exact odor that it leaves behind...
Traveler: Snezhnaya...
Yelan: Exactly. The evidence will soon be blown away by the wind, so it's nothing we can arrest anyone with.
Yelan: But it's all I need. Now I know who we're dealing with, I can plan our next move.
Black Screen Text: You leave the abandoned house with Yelan...
Wupei (???): Lady Yelan! Oh, thank goodness I finally found you! *sob* ...I thought I'd never see you again!
Paimon: ...Um, who are you?
Yelan: Don't be alarmed, this is Wupei. He's Wenyuan and Shanghua's colleague.
Yelan: I sent him to look into Zhiyi's regular contacts. Since Zhiyi likes fishing, Wupei thought he might know some of the fishermen and sailors, so he took a boat out to sea to ask around.
Yelan: I left him a note at Yanshang Teahouse telling him to look for me at Blackcliff Forge when he got back. If there'd been an ambush waiting for us there, it means we'd have had some backup.
Yelan: So, what did you find out at sea?
Wupei: *sigh* Forgive my incompetence. I'm afraid I've come up empty-handed.
Wupei: I asked all the fishermen multiple times, but none of them had had any interactions with Zhiyi before. Then the waves got so choppy I ended up falling overboard. Fortunately, someone managed to drag me out.
Wupei: When I got back, I heard that you'd gone to Blackcliff Forge and might need backup, so I went straight there as fast as I could. Didn't even stop to change my clothes.
Yelan: Oh? Well, Uncle Tian said that Zhiyi once bought a recipe from one of the fishermen. Did you hear anything about that at all?
Wupei: What? That's news to me.
Wupei: No, that's not possible... It's absolutely not possible! Lady Yelan, I'm telling you — I spoke to every single fisherman out there, and none of them mentioned anything about a recipe.
Yelan: Interesting... Then I wonder how that "even more wonderful" fish soup came about?
Wupei: Fish soup? What fish soup?
Yelan: Nothing. Our priority right now is to find a way to get our hands on some solid evidence.
Yelan: Well, any suggestions?
Traveler: Send someone to tail them?
Yelan: Not a bad idea. Wupei, what do you think?
Wupei: Honestly, I've already tried following Zhiyi. But the guy's too cautious. Never meets with anyone suspicious.
Paimon: Okay, so tailing's out...
Yelan: No, we'll still need to tail him. But first, we need to do some groundwork.
Paimon: Groundwork?
Yelan: When you've worked in intelligence for a long time, you'll understand that no one can stay on high alert forever. Especially... when he thinks he's about to win.
Yelan: Tomorrow morning, I'll announce his victory at Yuehai Pavillion. Take a guess, what do you think he'll do next?
Yelan: Be sure to arrive on time. You won't wanna miss the show.
Traveler: Catch them red-handed when they meet...
Traveler: The Fatui!
