# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: You have the prerogative as the owner of this place. Let's hear it.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...What, were you expecting me to start the conversation? That's probably not going to happen.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: It's not so much that I have nothing to say... I just have nothing fun or positive to share.
Traveler: It's okay. I know what you're like.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: You make it sound like that's some kind of achievement... I'm pretty frank with everyone nowadays.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...Although that hasn't always been the case.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Do you know why I'm so fond of tea?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: When I drank tea for the first time, all I tasted was bitterness. No matter how much I tried to drink, there was no sign of any kind of sweet aftertaste.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: At that time, I was sitting awkwardly by some bladesmiths. I was ignorant about the conventions for human conversation and their ways of life.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Someone poured out a cup for me, and for lack of anything else to do, I accepted it. Ended up downing one cup, then another, and then another...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Hahaha... Now that I think back on it, they probably thought I genuinely liked to drink the stuff.
Traveler: And now?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...And now that I've had a taste of just about every flavor in this world, I've found that actually... bitterness is the one I like best.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Spices are just added extras to mask a bland base, and all sweetness does is make the ugly truth easier to stomach... But bitterness is the true flavor of life. Raw and unadulterated.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: I don't care for dressing things up to make them more palatable. Life is about learning to handle the truth.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Bitterness is what it is. It doesn't change because of what comes before or after it.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: There's no need to kid yourself into thinking that a bitter cup of tea will have a sweet aftertaste.
