Traveler: Young people, you say?
Shushan: You need skill and stamina to work with stone. Your body won't be able to cope unless you start training from a young age.
Shushan: But some youngsters are too eager for success and end up taking the wrong path...
Shushan: After learning some fancy skills from elsewhere, they carve and polish pure white stones to make mementos, which they then sell to outsiders...
Shushan: Such things are nice to keep as a souvenir if reasonably priced, but they're not worth it at all if they're too expensive.
Shushan: After all, ordinary stone is not the equal of jade. It should be used to build ordinary houses, roads, and bridges.
