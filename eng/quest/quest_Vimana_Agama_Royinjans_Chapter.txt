# Vimana Agama: Royinjan's Chapter


## Talk 1

Royinjan: It should be in a cave somewhere near here. Is my memory going or something?
Paimon: Why don't we ask the villagers of Vimara Village? They should know if there's a cave around here.
Royinjan: The villagers? Eh, there's no point asking them. This is a secret base! How would they even know where it is? If I remember correctly, the cave entrance should be behind these vines, so let's split up and search for it.
Royinjan: This great researcher and I will go look over there. You two search this place, alright?
Paimon: Alrighty, then let's start our search from the vines here. Gah, there really are so many of them, though...
Ararycan: These are not vines, they're Vamadha.
Paimon: Eh? You know something about this, Ararycan?
Ararycan: Yeah, these are Vamadha. Aranara made them.
Traveler: Why would the Aranara make this?
Ararycan: Aranara make Vamadha when they don't want Nara to enter a place. Where Vamadha are present, only Aranara can enter.
Paimon: Huh... Aranara are pretty small, but the place's been blocked completely. Paimon thinks even you can't get through.
Ararycan: Nara can't get in, but Aranara can sing. Vamadha spin when they hear us singing, and when they do, we can enter.
Traveler: Spin?
Ararycan: #Yep! Nara {NICKNAME} is a friend of the forest. If you sing, Nara {NICKNAME}, the Vamadha will hear it. Come on, Ararycan will teach you!
Traveler: Like a ball?

## Talk 2

Royinjan: I recall it should be around here...
Royinjan: Why can't I find it...

## Talk 3

Jazari: I didn't expect that there would be a Ruin Golem component that I've never seen before. How much more of this Ruin Golem have I not discovered?
Jazari: Have you found the fragments of the Amiti Device? My academic career is in your hands here!

## Talk 4

Jazari: Ugh, why am I looking for some secret base here again...? Oh, whatever. It's all in the name of academic research. Yes, yes...
Jazari: We're going to fall behind on research progress if we don't find the Amiti Device quickly.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Wow, no kidding! It really started spinning like a ball.
Traveler: Aaand there's our mysterious cave entrance.
Ararycan: Ararycan remembers this cave.
Paimon: Eh? Did you make this Vamadha, Ararycan?
Ararycan: Ararycan doesn't remember, but little Nara must be protected. This much Ararycan knows.
Paimon: Well, we've no clue why this place was sealed by the Aranara, but this should be the entrance to the secret base, so let's call those two over.
Royinjan: Haha, I knew this was the place! Our secret base should be this way... How did you guys find it?
Ararycan: Ararycan did a great job.
Jazari: Eh, either way... Since you found the entrance to the cave, let's go in. We just have to find the Amiti Device next...
Royinjan: It's pretty big inside. Don't get scared now...

## Talk 6

Paimon: Wow! This place is really huge! You were a pretty impressive kid, eh, Royinjan?
Royinjan: Not bad, eh? But it's much smaller than I remember.
Traveler: That's because you've grown up.
Royinjan: Haha, more than grown up. I'm an old man now.
Royinjan: But this place really hasn't changed at all. It's like time stood still here.
Royinjan: Even the air smells the same. A single whiff brings back so many memories...
Jazari: Let's not waste time. Do you remember where the Amiti Device is?
Royinjan: Patience, youngster. Let's take a look around first.
Paimon: One thing has been bugging Paimon since we first walked in. What is this huge machine part?
Ararycan: Oh, Ararycan knows. This was moved here from the Giant Iron Mountain.
Paimon: Giant Iron Mountain... You mean it was taken from the Ruin Golem from before?
Jazari: You noticed it too? Judging from the pattern, such parts should belong to the Ruin Golem, though I don't know why it was arranged in this fashion.
Jazari: Perhaps you really do have some academic talent. Would you like me to recommend you to study in the Akademiya once our project comes to a close?
Jazari: You're sure to make lots of friends there.
Paimon: Uh, that's not what this is about... but thanks anyway.
Paimon: But a child shouldn't have been able to move anything this big. So who piled it up here in this way?
Royinjan: Maybe it was a forest spirit! ...Nah, just kidding. I can't remember.
Ararycan: Ararycan knows! Ararycan moved it.
Paimon: How did you move something this big?
Ararycan: Ararycan can move it. Ararycan is very strong.
Royinjan: Haha, I remember two groups of us kids running around this big guy and play-fighting.
Traveler: Were there that many children here before?
Royinjan: In the beginning, yes... Our group's stronghold should be up ahead...
Royinjan: Oh, I remember now. I think I buried something over there. I'll take you.
Traveler: So who won in the end?
Royinjan: Me, of course! I've never lost! Our group's stronghold should be up ahead...
Traveler: This is probably because Paimon's small.
Royinjan: I was also a child at that time. I'm an old man now.

## Talk 7

Paimon: C'mon, c'mon! Paimon wants to see what we've got... Eh? It's just a booklet.
Royinjan: Oooh, this is good stuff! This was our "Adventure Handbook" back in the day.
Paimon: Adventure Handbook?
Royinjan: Don't you guys know about Adventure Handbooks? I thought you were adventurers from abroad based on how you look and the fact that you're here looking for treasure or something.
Traveler: Yes, I did in fact get an Adventurer Handbook.
Royinjan: Right? Many adventurers write them. It's like an adventure journal, to record their experiences, plans, and even the clues to treasure locations.
Royinjan: As you guys know, my grandfather was a great adventurer, though I didn't understand a lick of what he wrote into his adventure journal.
Royinjan: Still, I grew up wanting to be an adventurer, so I made my own imitation adventure handbook. You could say that's where I got my start.
Jazari: I know how important this is to you, but it won't help us find the thing we're looking for.
Royinjan: Now, now, not so fast. Didn't I tell you that I planned to find the Amiti Device? What happened then is recorded in this Adventure Handbook.
Royinjan: Let me see... I remember that the two of us... Wait a moment. Why are there three people in the drawing? Has my memory already gone that bad? Or is it because my eyes can't see well anymore?
Jazari: Do you need me to lend you my glasses? I have the latest model, as produced by the Akademiya.
Royinjan: Sir Researcher, are you really that... Forget it, let me take a closer look... I'm pretty sure now that the Amiti Device should have been buried right here by yours truly.
Jazari: Great! So we just have to search this cave... is what I would say, if this place wasn't quite so big.
Royinjan: There's no need for that. The location of the device is recorded here. It should be...
Traveler: Oh, I've seen this sort of adventure log before...

## Talk 8

Jazari: Yes, this is indeed the Amiti Device.
Royinjan: See? I didn't lie to you guys!
Paimon: Yay! Now we can scuttle right back and open that giant robot up, right? Hehe, Paimon's getting excited already!
Jazari: Hmm. Alas, this is just a fragment. There's no way we will open the Ruin Golem without a complete device.
Jazari: I can fix it if it's not been completely destroyed, but we will have to find some way to recover the remaining pieces.
Traveler: And as for these remaining fragments...
Royinjan: Oh, don't be so anxious. The device was split into three parts.
Royinjan: But why would grandpa put them in three different locations...? You know what? This would be a very exciting story, if only I remembered more of it.
Paimon: Three different places... So, are the locations of the fragments recorded here?
Royinjan: Yes, that's right. The locations of the buried device fragments are all recorded in this handbook. We must have found the fragment buried here back then from... wherever it was at first.
Paimon: #In that case, let's go find the remaining two fragments using this. We're the best at finding things, aren't we, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: We're pretty good at finding things. But as for people...
Paimon: #...Mm, yeah, Paimon knows what you mean. It's alright, though! We'll surely find {F#him}{M#her}.
Royinjan: Heh. That's what I said, anyway, but...
Paimon: But?
Royinjan: I can't understand these writings.
Paimon: Eh? How can that be? Didn't you write these notes yourself?
Royinjan: Um... Well, this is actually a record of the adventure that the two... Well, maybe the three of us undertook.
Royinjan: I can't remember who this third person was, but I certainly haven't forgotten that old man. If you want to know the location of the remaining device fragments, you should go look for him.
Royinjan: That old man should still be kicking even now, and if he is, he definitely still lives in Vimara Village. He did say he would live out the rest of his days there, after all.
Traveler: The old man you're talking about is...
Paimon: Amadhiah, maybe?
Royinjan: Oh? You know that old fellow? Well, that makes things easier! Take this handbook and show it to him. He should understand.
Paimon: Eh? You aren't gonna come with us?
Royinjan: Hmph, I don't want to meet that old fossil.
Royinjan: If you've figured out where the fragments are buried, go look for them yourself. I would like to go with you, but my old bones aren't up to the task anymore.
Royinjan: I wanted to be a great adventurer like my grandfather back when I was a young boy. And if it hadn't been for that guy...
Royinjan: ...Well. Stories are, in the end, more important than the adventure itself. So if you collect any stories, please remember to bring them to me.
Royinjan: I can give you guys this device fragment as a reward. How about that? It's a good deal, right?
Traveler: You have a deal!
Jazari: Well, it looks like I won't be of much help in this endeavor. So I might as well wait here for you. There are a lot of parts here to study, and I'm not going to pass up the chance to do it.
Jazari: I'm counting on you two to bring the fragments back as quickly as you can. Things will get dicey for me if I miss the deadline.
Traveler: It's not like we have any other options.
Traveler: Yeah!

## Talk 9

Royinjan: This is such a nostalgic place. It's like the very dirt and air here are trying to tell me something... But I just can't recall anything.
Royinjan: Did you guys find the device fragments you're after? Remember to bring the stories you've collected to me afterward, alright?

## Talk 10

Amadhiah: Ah, we meet again, friends of Rana. Is she not with you? I wonder what's taking her so long to patrol the woods this time...
Amadhiah: Still, this must be a special occasion, for you to come to see me.
Paimon: Well, yeah. It's for...
Black Screen Text: You tell Amadhiah about Royinjan, the secret base, and the handbook.\nIt is a story with a lot of twists.
Amadhiah: So you went to the secret base. What do you think? Pretty impressive, isn't it?
Amadhiah: Royinjan is here in Vimara and still doesn't want to see me. That fellow gets more stubborn the older he gets...
Amadhiah: That's how he is, though. It's almost been ten years since I last saw him.
Amadhiah: And that was when I had some business in Port Ormos. I'm relieved to hear he's still himself.
Traveler: That's an odd relationship you have between you.
Paimon: So why doesn't Royinjan want to see you?
Amadhiah: It's a long story... You wouldn't mind hearing an old man prattle on, would you?
Traveler: I'm quite curious, actually.
Paimon: Yes, Paimon wants to know too!
Amadhiah: Back when we were kids, Royinjan lived in Vimara for a while because of his grandfather.
Amadhiah: As a kid from bustling Port Ormos with a legendary adventurer for his grandfather, Royinjan quickly drew the attention of the other kids.
Amadhiah: I was one of those kids who was fascinated by the stories he heard from his grandfather.
Amadhiah: Together, we built a "secret base" in a cave and dressed ourselves up as warriors and heroes with branches and flowers.
Amadhiah: To us children, the base was another world, where we went through countless imaginary adventures.
Amadhiah: Those old times seem like a dream now.
Paimon: Royinjan also mentioned that the base once played host to loads of kids, so what happened?
Traveler: All dreams end someday.
Amadhiah: Yeah, kids do have short attention spans in any case. Be it legends or adventures, these are just some of their many passing interests.
Amadhiah: By the time we realized that truth, Royinjan and I were the only two left in the base... No, make that three, actually.
Paimon: Royinjan also mentioned there were three of you, but he can't recall the third person anymore.
Amadhiah: I'm not sure, either. It's been so long and we're both old now... Who could it have been...?
Traveler: An Aranara, perhaps?
Amadhiah: These "Aranara" again? Now that sounds like make-believe worthy of children.
Amadhiah: If I had left Vimara with him, I'd probably still believe in all that.
Paimon: With him, you say... So why did Royinjan leave then?
Amadhiah: For his adventures, of course. That guy's been stubborn ever since we were kids.
Amadhiah: We'd vowed to become the greatest adventurers in the world, just like his legendary grandfather.
Amadhiah: But neither of us had the knack for being one. After my initial enthusiasm had worn off, I found that I had far more important things to do.
Amadhiah: So in the end, he was the last one left.
Amadhiah: That's why we're like this now. The way he sees it, I was more of an adventurer, yet I gave up before he did.
Amadhiah: Stubbornness, that's all it is. Still, it was also thanks to Royinjan's stubbornness that he wound up being the best antique dealer in Port Ormos.
Amadhiah: Well, that's it for the story. You want to know where to find the two fragments, right?
Amadhiah: It's going to take a while to mark them out for you, though. My eyesight's gotten quite deplorable in my old age...
Amadhiah: I'll count this as a commission from him. I used traditional Vimara cursive for this, which he should be able to comprehend — he definitely would've back then, anyway!
Black Screen Text: Amadhiah makes some notes about the fragments, using the handbook as a reference.
Amadhiah: It's done. Just follow the instructions and you'll be all right. To be honest, I never thought that this thing would still have its uses after all these years.
Amadhiah: Ah, yes, I just found this in the journal too.
Black Screen Text: Grandpa Amadhiah picks a dried flower out from the yellowed sheets.
Amadhiah: Give this to Royinjan when you see him again. Maybe this will jog his memory a bit.
Paimon: Why didn't you say anything back there, Ararycan? Amadhiah's a good Nara. You have nothing to fear.
Ararycan: Ararycan wasn't afraid. Ararycan has heard of the things you talked about earlier, and they're very familiar. Just can't remember them...
Ararycan: Ararycan was confused, so Ararycan didn't say anything.
Traveler: That's quite a strange problem, Ararycan.
Ararycan: Yes, very strange!
Paimon: This is tiring, but at least we're making progress. Anyway, let's do what Amadhiah said and go find the two fragments, then give them to Jazari.
Traveler: All kids grow up eventually.
Traveler: As long as you don't go on for too long...
Amadhiah: Ha, I'll make it short!

## Talk 11

Paimon: Hey Royinjan, we're back!
Royinjan: There you are. Looks like you met the old man and found the fragments you were looking for, hmm?
Royinjan: That aside, is he as tedious now as he was then? Not that I care though.
Traveler: Seems you do.
Royinjan: What did Amadhiah tell you? Don't believe anything he said! If he hadn't slipped back into the village the night before our adventure at sea...
Royinjan: We could have been the greatest adventurers in history.
Traveler: Doesn't sound very likely...
Royinjan: Come on, I'm just kidding. I'm better suited to dealing in antiques.
Royinjan: Even a great adventurer like my grandfather eventually went missing in their adventures. I doubt I would've stood much of a chance.
Royinjan: For me, I'd be satisfied so long as there's a story to hear. So, what stories have you collected? According to our deal, the device fragments in your hands were meant to be exchanged for stories.
Traveler: About the inundated device and The Withering...
Black Screen Text: You tell Royinjan about your search for the device fragments.
Royinjan: Haha, that's a great adventure indeed. You are marvelous adventurers. If only I had been able to complete such a journey myself.
Royinjan: That's a good enough story for me. The fragments are yours, as we agreed.
Royinjan: Take them to our great researcher. He's been stressing out this entire time while you were out having your fun.
Royinjan: I should get back to my shop now. I'll be quite upset if I missed out on a big sale.
Paimon: Wait a second, we have something else we have to do. That flower...
Traveler: Amadhiah wanted you to have this.
Royinjan: A flower? Seriously? At his age?
Royinjan: Hold on, I think I remember this...
Paimon: Have you recalled anything?
Royinjan: Haha. Maybe, but then again, maybe not. Anyway, the past should stay in the past, so forget it.
Royinjan: But I have a feeling this flower does not belong to me, so please, return it to where it belongs. I can tell that you can see things I can't.
Royinjan: He seems to have become a bit more fun than before...
Royinjan: Do drop by my shop when you get the chance. Until then, farewell!
Paimon: Where it belongs... The flower is yours, Ararycan.
Ararycan: This flower is precious. Why give it to Ararycan?
Paimon: Because it belongs to you!
Ararycan: Ararycan doesn't remember the flower, but Ararycan likes it.
Ararycan: Ararycan cherishes this flower. Ararycan shall plant it in the garden.
Paimon: We'll see you at the foot of the Great Iron Mountain. Once we get the giant machine started, we'll go get the bad guys together.
Ararycan: Yes, Ararycan wants to fight the bad guys with you!
Paimon: That's a promise, Ararycan!
Traveler: About the fairies and the children...
Black Screen Text: You tell Royinjan about the adventure of the Aranara and the children.
Royinjan: Fairies in the forest... I've heard similar legends before, but your tale is a particularly interesting one.
Traveler: You can't change the past.
Traveler: You two are so alike.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Jazari: Thank goodness you're back.
Traveler: Here are the two remaining fragments...
Jazari: Ah, yes, that's them, alright! Thank you so much for your help. I'll take care of the rest.
Black Screen Text: Jazari fixes the Amiti Device.
Jazari: Well, this should do the trick. Haha, pretty good, eh? Why, I bet that even a Herbad of the Akademiya couldn't fix this thing without consulting any information.
Jazari: You're lucky to have me with you, you know? Now we can get inside the Ruin Golem!
Traveler: Uh... I think that's our line.
Jazari: Ah, no one's been in this machine for centuries. I can already smell the parchment of the pages in the academic annals that shall bear my name! ...Oh, um, sorry. I got too excited.
Paimon: No problem. Paimon's getting excited too! Mora or treasure, here we come!
