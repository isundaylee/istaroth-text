# Sakura Tempura

A dish deep-fried in oil. Incorporate the marinated sakura blossom petals into the batter before giving the fresh shrimp and vegetables an even coating, frying, and then draining the oil. This all sounds simple enough, but good tempura making is not something achieved in a mere day.
