The verdict came down: This Melusine is guilty
The Iudex defended the authority of Fontaine law
But he did not confiscate the Melusine's medical kit
And so, the Fortress of Meropide gained a new little doctor
She still wore her hood and raincoat
Even though it never rained in the Fortress
Perhaps thanks to her human appearance, no one refused her treatment
She treated more and more patients, and her sentence grew ever shorter
Finally, the people of the Fortress could not live without her
And though her sentence ended, she did not leave them either
Then one day, she received an invitation from the outside world
The location seemed familiar, and when she arrived, an old lady was waiting for her
She saw right through the Melusine's disguise, but didn't reveal it
Instead, she asked a question
Tell me, why do you think you gained the respect of so many people
Despite being a Melusine?
Because... I look like a human?
It's been fifty years, Sigewinne
And you haven't aged a day...
I think everyone knows you are not human
I've finally found you, after all these years
I still remember, you know. It was you who saved me that night
But how? I was no longer a Melusine by then
Does it really matter if you're human or Melusine?
I remembered the warmth of your palm
It's quite unmistakable
And you know what? It hasn't changed one bit
You don't have to hide anymore, Sigewinne
These days, everyone wants to make friends with Melusines
And I think that it's all because of you
I'm sorry I couldn't say this until now, but...
Thank you, Doctor Melusine
