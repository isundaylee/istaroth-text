Traveler: Yes? What's on the menu today?
Tusheng: Today it's... Oh, it's you. I thought it was that old fogey. Seriously, what's his problem, shouting all the time at his age? My poor ears...
Tusheng: Well, anyway. I've prepared some Sunsettia and Berry slices mixed in Sweet Flower juice, along with some minced Berries and Mints...

Traveler: See you around.
Tusheng: See you. I'll be off to feed the Sumpter Beasts, then.

Traveler: ...Wow, you're making me hungry already.
Tusheng: That won't come cheap, you know! The ingredients I use are all fresh as can be.
Tusheng: That old fogey's a miser and wouldn't listen to anyone to save his life... But he's generous enough when it comes to the Sumpter Beasts.
Tusheng: Hmph, not that this would ever lead to me getting a raise, though.
