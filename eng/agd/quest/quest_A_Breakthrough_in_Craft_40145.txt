Freda: Hello there! As always, I, Freda, will do my best to assist you today.
Traveler: Improve operating efficiency...
Traveler: Purchase supplies...
Traveler: Goodbye.
Freda: Best of luck with your business!

## Talk 2

Black Screen Text: After a brief trial period, the potion shop opens to great success...
Paimon: *sigh* We just keep getting swarmed with more and more customers. It's been nonstop work for so long, Paimon's starting to feel a bit lightheaded...
Traveler: Business sure is booming...
Paimon: We've got a lot of orders. Paimon's not sure we can fill them all on our own.
Paimon: Maybe we should hire some help...
Lisa: Taking a break, cuties?
Lisa: I was just looking at the sales data, and it seems like you two have quite the talent for business. The potions seem to be flying off the shelves!
Paimon: Oh, Lisa! Perfect timing! We were just talking about how we could use some help around the shop.
Lisa: Oh? Are the orders piling up already? Having trouble keeping up?
Paimon: Yep, we're officially swamped! Paimon never thought we'd get this many customers...
Lisa: Well, I can't say I'm surprised by the success. I was actually anticipating this kind of response.
Lisa: While you two were busy with the shop, I was talking with Freda about some possible ways to make the business more efficient.
Lisa: After observing your work, I made note of several improvements we can make to the brewing, cultivation, and sales aspects of the business.
Paimon: Wait, so you've been doing things behind the scenes this whole time!
Paimon: Paimon kinda thought you were just slacking off...
Lisa: Hey now, I'm actually pretty reliable when it counts!
Paimon: So how are we supposed to put those improvements in action?
Lisa: Well, I discussed things over with Freda, and the two of us came up with a plan.
Lisa: I'll let her give you the details, though. Why don't you go and find her?
Traveler: We've made quite the name for ourselves.

## Talk 3

Freda: #Traveler! Paimon! Hello! Is there something I can help you with?
Paimon: Well, we've been a bit swamped lately, so Lisa recommended we find some ways to increase our efficiency...
Freda: Ah, yes! I discussed that with her as well.
Freda: Currently, there are three areas you can improve â€” brewing, cultivation, and sales.
Freda: Increasing your efficiency in these areas will make it much easier to run your business.
Paimon: #Wow, that sounds just like what we need! Let's give it a try, Traveler!
Traveler: Improve operating efficiency...
Freda: Looks like all the preparations needed for this upgrade have been made! Please try it out.
Traveler: Purchase supplies...
Freda: You're in luck! I just got a new batch of provisions! Please take a look and see if anything catches your eye!
Traveler: Goodbye.
Freda: Best of luck with your business!

## Talk 4

Lisa: Have a question for me, cutie?
Traveler: About improving efficiency...
Lisa: After observing your work, I made note of several improvements we can make to the brewing, cultivation, and sales aspects of the business.
Lisa: Freda can tell you more about implementing these upgrades.
Traveler: I have no more questions.
Lisa: Well, if there's anything else you want to ask, don't hesitate to come and find me.
