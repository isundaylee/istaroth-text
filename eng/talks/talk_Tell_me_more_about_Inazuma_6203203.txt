Bibo: Tell me more about Inazuma.
Bibo: For the average person, getting into Inazuma is nigh on impossible!
Bibo: Even if you're lucky enough to make it across the ocean alive, that border is simply impenetrable.
Bibo: I do not understand their national administration's mindset. Far too isolationist in my opinion...
Bibo: Not long ago, I actually rescued a girl who escaped from Inazuma... She's the only person I've ever known to get out of there without official approval.
Bibo: So, if you're one of these who is desperate for a new Inazuman toy to play with, I'm telling you â€” let it go!
