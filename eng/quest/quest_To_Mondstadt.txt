# To Mondstadt


## Talk 1

Paimon: Since it's Mona's treat, we can order whatever we want, right?
Mona: Of course. I am a most generous master, after all. But only if you can finish it all. Wasting food simply will not do.

## Talk 2

Huai'an: Hello, how may I help you?
Paimon: We'd like to borrow the kitchen here.
Traveler: A friend of mine would like to eat a special dish.
Huai'an: Ah, I see. In that case, sure. As long as you've prepared your own ingredients, feel free to use the kitchen.
Huai'an: If I may... You must be well-versed in the art of cooking, yes?
Traveler: Of course. If I make it, it's delicious!
Huai'an: Haha, talented indeed. Actually, I have a small suggestion to make...
Huai'an: From your clothes, you're most likely not from around these parts. But since you've come to Liyue, would you like to try making Liyue-style cuisine?
Huai'an: I have a recipe for Golden Crab with me. It's a Yue cuisine classic.
Huai'an: It's crab meat that's been rolled in flour, deep-fried, and then pan-fried together with ginger and garlic. When you finally plate it up, the crab seems to be lying on gold.
Paimon: Golden... Crab!
Traveler: That sounds a little complicated.
Paimon: #Golden Crab, Traveler! Golden Crab!
Traveler: I got it, I got it. Golden Crab.
Paimon: Heh-heh. Then let's get to it!
Paimon: With your skills in the kitchen, this'll be a cinch!
Traveler: ...I guess I'm learning it for your sake, too.
Traveler: Learning a whole new dish for Mona's sake is a bit...
Traveler: Not really...
Huai'an: Haha, how humble of you. Actually, I have a little suggestion...
Traveler: My friend would like to eat something made by me.

## Talk 3

Mona: There's no need to spend all that effort on me, I'm not in dire need of food...
Mona: I am a little hungry... but it's not a big deal.

## Talk 4

Mona: There's no need to spend all that effort on me, I'm not in dire need of food...
Mona: I am a little hungry... but it's not a big deal.

## Talk 5

Mona: Phew. That was tiring, but we're finally in Mondstadt.
Mona: The quest to plumb the wondrous depths of knowledge is indeed arduous...
Paimon: Paimon's not tired.
Mona: Ugh, that's because you float.
Paimon: Well, it doesn't look like an astrologist is all that amazing either.
Mona: That's because you have too many unrealistic fantasies about astrology.
Tyler: Are you also resting your feet here?
Paimon: Who are you?
Tyler: Oh, my brothers and I are all merchants. We just finished doing business in Liyue, and we're preparing to head back to Mondstadt.
Tyler: You look rather tired. The cart we hired will be coming in a while — what say you to coming along for the ride?
Traveler: Well, I am a little tired...
Traveler: Do I need to pay?
Tyler: Haha, let's go, then. We can make conversation along the way, the more the merrier.
Tyler: No need, no need, we're already heading that way anyway.
Mona: There's no need. Now shoo. Get out of our way.
Tyler: Eh? Miss... Is there something wrong?
Mona: Cease your pretensions, bandit.
Mona: Picking up people on the road who appear vulnerable, robbing them blind once they've gotten on the cart, and then taking them to some archon-forsaken place — is that your deal?
Tyler: Wh—What are you saying? We came over here to make conversation, and this is how we're rewarded? With insults?
Tyler: If you don't want to get on, don't! Crazy girl...
Mona: Well then, shall I tell you now which objects you have on you that are stolen?
Mona: If you have any quibbles, we can bring people to corroborate what I've said, and all will come to light.
Mona: If I lose, I'll pay you twenty thousand Mora. But if I win, then you'll be eating prison rations in Liyue Harbor tonight.
Mona: How about it? If you're real legitimate businessmen, there's nothing to fear, is there?
Tyler: You... You!
Tyler: You've pushed it too far, brat!
Tyler: I don't know how you found out, but as long as we get rid of you, no one will have to know!
Traveler: Careful, Mona!
Traveler: You will not touch her!
Mona: Don't fret, it's just a few bandits.
Mona: You said earlier that there was nothing amazing about astrologists... Well then, this is a good time to show you what your master can do.

## Talk 6

Traveler: How about this Crab Roe Tofu...
Yuhua: Though tofu could not be a more ordinary ingredient, it and crab roe are truly a match made in heaven. It's one of our specialties.

## Talk 7

Traveler: And this Bamboo Shoot Soup...
Yuhua: This is a favorite among our regulars. Bamboo shoots, meat and ham are cooked together, creating a richly-flavored soup.
Yuhua: Pour a few spoonfuls into each bowl of rice you eat — you'll never get enough of it!

## Talk 8

Traveler: I'll order them all.
Mona: A—All of them? We only have three... No, two and a half people? Isn't that too much food?
Paimon: That's not how you count it! Besides, Paimon hasn't even ordered yet!
Paimon: Squirrel Fish, Jueyun Chili Chicken, and Jewelry Soup, please!
Yuhua: Sure. And is there anything else that you would like to order, ma'am?
Mona: I—I'd just like to ask, how much do the current dishes cost in total?
Yuhua: Um, around twenty thousand Mora.
Mona: Then... Uh, I—I'll just have some vegetarian noodles, please.
Yuhua: Alright. A bowl of vegetarian noodles, was it? Please wait a moment, we will serve you shortly.
Paimon: Paimon's been thinking about something since we started eating...
Traveler: Why did she only order one dish?
Paimon: Is it... because she actually doesn't have money?
Mona: I heard that! I said I was treating. How could I be rattled by something as mundane as Mora!?
Mona: An astrologist's mind is set on studying the stars. Being so easily disturbed by such banal matters would hamper my judgment.
Mona: Especially the act of overly gratifying oneself using Mora. It is both vulgar...
Mona: *stomach grumble*
Mona: ...and dangerous.
Paimon: So not eating the dishes we ordered is also part of an astrologist's pride? Paimon doesn't get it.
Paimon: But it feels kinda bad that only we got to feast...
Traveler: Let me whip something up for you.
Paimon: Oh, yes! We can do that! Just give us a minute!

## Talk 9

Mona: Hmph, what did you think? Did that satisfy your expectations?
Traveler: Your combat abilities were amazing.
Mona: Such things are elementary for an astrologist.
Mona: Lies are worthless before astrology. Destiny and truth are written in the stars.
Mona: Though it may take more time to garner the specifics, I can read the gist of a situation at a glance.
Paimon: But you did hit some bumps in the road...
Mona: That's because Teyvat's stars can only display the fates and truths of "this world."
Mona: Anything related to you becomes like a fog that even I cannot penetrate.
Mona: That is why I must meet that successor. With our knowledge combined, I might be able to gain new insight into your fate.
Traveler: I'm a little excited.
Mona: Ha. Whatever the case, you've got everything to gain from this trip.
Mona: Alright, I'm rested. Let's get this journey to *Mondstadt* over with!
Paimon: *sigh* If only we had a cart...
Mona: I thought you weren't tired!
Traveler: I'm not getting my hopes up...
Traveler: It's impressive that you saw through those bandits.

## Talk 10

Mr. Zhu: Thank you all so much. You're welcome to drop by again.
Mr. Zhu: Well, if this inn hasn't closed its doors yet, haha...

## Talk 11

Yuhua: Excuse me, what would you like to order?

## Talk 12

Traveler: These Golden Shrimp Balls...
Yuhua: These are made using large, succulent shrimp wrapped in crispy-fried potatoes. They have an amazing texture.

## Talk 13

Traveler: As for the Vegetarian Abalone...
Yuhua: It's exactly what it says on the label — abalone made from vegetarian ingredients. It's just as good as the real thing!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Mona: Th—This aroma is...
Traveler: Something to go with your noodles.
Mona: I never thought it'd be so luxurious...
Mona: Fine. Since my disciple has put in so much time and effort, I must — with great difficulty — accept.
Mona: ...Aah! It's delicious! It's the most delicious thing I've eaten recently!
Mona: Ah, uh, I mean... *cough* I never knew that my disciple was this skilled. As your master, I am most comforted.
Traveler: As long as you're eating a full meal.
Mona: I see that it's no boast to call them Liyue's delicacies.
Mona: I suppose it wasn't too much to spend all this Mora on...
Mona: Ah, it's nothing. Nothing at all. Now that we've eaten and drank our fill, we should be off.
Mona: If we travel north from here, we should reach the *Stone Gate*, and from there, we will be within the boundaries of Mondstadt.
Mona: What deep mysteries shall we acquire knowledge of? *chuckles* I'm looking forward to it.
Traveler: You say that, but you're clearly relishing the meal.
Traveler: Your special order, ma'am.
Mona: W-Wow, it's incredible...!
