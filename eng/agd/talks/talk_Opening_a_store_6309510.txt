Traveler: Opening a store?
Robert: Aye, yes. As you know, the Sakoku Decree has been abolished.
Robert: So honestly, I could return to Mondstadt any time. But I just can't do it — I mean, how can I just leave Inazuma without having done any business here?
Robert: And I've heard the news, you know — about all the people coming here to Ritou, looking to establish their businesses. That really gets my fingers itching, you know? So... What do you think? Should I give this a go?
