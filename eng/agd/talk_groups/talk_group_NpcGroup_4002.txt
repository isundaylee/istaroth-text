Iris: I'll think about my research topic before Nayab finds a new counter card.

Traveler: About your research topic...
Iris: I come from a family of academics. Everyone has either worked at the Akademiya or continued their studies there. So, research has become an essential part of my life.
Iris: I'm from Vahum{RUBY#[S]Aetiology}ana, and am currently conducting research on the history of the desert and King Deshret.
Iris: One of my younger sisters also happens to be researching the semantics of the ancient King Deshret runes, so occasionally we'll discuss our findings together.
Iris: But she has to instruct new students during the day, so we can only talk at night.

Traveler: About that countermeasure card...
Iris: Well, you know the popular card game "Genius Invokation TCG"? It was invented in Sumeru and then spread throughout Teyvat via Inazuma.
Iris: I'd only heard about this game before, but never tried it. Then one day, I came here to have a coffee and Nayab invited me to play a round.
Iris: I was scared out of my wits at first. I thought I'd inadvertently let slip some forbidden knowledge about King Deshret and that the matra had found me.
Iris: But it was fine in the end. After this matra came over, it was just a few bizarre deck questions from there.
Iris: That isn't the sort of thing I'm good at. I just ask the questions. As for the solutions, I let him work them out for himself.

Traveler: See you.

Traveler: It's pretty hard.
Iris: Tell me about it. By the time he comes up with a solution, my sisters and I might have already finished our researches.
Iris: However, doing research is similar to playing cards. You need to think out of the box to make a breakthrough.

## Talk 4

Iris: Are you sure you've found the correct semantic field for these ancient runes?
Hawa: Of course I'm not sure. I'm only speculating.
Hawa: Besides, I discovered that there are overlapping marks on the ancient runes on this stone wall.
Hawa: So, I have reason to suspect that they may have been carved by people over several generations.
Iris: Well, that complicates things... In my history researches, the meanings of runes like these can differ significantly from era to era.
Iris: When will Father finish his desert expedition again? We should ask him what he thinks when he gets back.
Iris: Or ask Rifaet. Maybe he has some leads.
