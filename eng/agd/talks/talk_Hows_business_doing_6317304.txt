Traveler: How's business doing?
Tomoki: Erm... I am new to cooking, after all. It'd be best if I took things one step at a time...
Tomoki: Though my dishes may sound a little strange, everyone who's tried it has said that they taste pretty good.
Tomoki: Sir Kamisato of the Yashiro Commission visited my shop last time and took a liking to our milk tea!
Tomoki: However, perhaps the mix of foods is a little too strange, because we rarely get any returning guests. I suppose people are still too used to ordinary cuisine...
Tomoki: Seems like I need to put more work into how I promote all this creativity...
