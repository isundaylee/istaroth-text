# Confessions of an Outlander


## Talk 1

Kageyama: Hello, please state your name, identity, and the purpose of your visit. Oh, except you, Thoma.
Kageyama: You must be... new here.
Paimon: Heh...
Kageyama: Excuse me? Please provide the information requested, and also declare any goods you are carrying with you.
Traveler: We are here to... trade wine. And ore.
Kageyama: Currently, only members of the International Trade Association are authorized to engage in the import and export of goods. Do you have your trader's permits?
Paimon: Um... uh... w—we—uh...
Kageyama: My apologies, but I'll have to ask you to—
Thoma: Here are their entry papers, for your kind perusal.
Paimon: What!? Ugh, take your time! No rush or anything!
Thoma: Haha, I just wanted to see what you'd say... sorry about that.
Kageyama: ...I see, okay. Your papers are all in order. Welcome to Ritou.
Paimon: Pheeeew...
Paimon: So, where do we go next?
Thoma: The Outlander Affairs Agency.
Thoma: They only check entry permits here. If you want to remain on Ritou, there's a process you have to go through with them.
Paimon: Sheesh, so it is super strict, just like everyone says.
Thoma: Well, let's not forget that to everyday folk in Inazuma, people from everywhere else are referred to as "outsiders."
Thoma: As the word suggests, outlanders aren't very welcome in Inazuma with the Sakoku Decree in force.
Thoma: Not even on Ritou, where they've established an Outsider Settlement.
Traveler: Welcome or not, we don't have a choice.
Thoma: Hehe, I like how you think. I've got a feeling we're going to get along very well.
Thoma: Now. Let's head over to the Outlander Affairs Agency.
Traveler: My journey must go on.
Traveler: #We are here to find my {F#brother}{M#sister}.
Kageyama: Oh? Well, I'm sorry. We cannot approve entry for purely personal reasons. So, unless you have a valid reason for visiting in accordance with the rules...

## Talk 2

Yurika: You've completed the entry procedures, yes? And now you want to apply for residency? Both of you?
Paimon: Yes, please!
Yurika: Okay. The processing fee will be two million Mora.
Paimon: T—Two million! For a processing fee? Are you serious!?
Yurika: That's right, one million per applicant, which makes two million total. Don't worry, you can trust my math.
Paimon: Paimon wasn't so much questioning your math as... Ugh...
Thoma: Hahaha... Ma'am, these two here are good friends of mine. I think you'll find I'm one face you recognize.
Yurika: Ah, Mr. Thoma, it's you. By way of courtesy, allow me to reduce it to 400,000 Mora total.
Traveler: That's still quite expensive...
Thoma: Thank you ever so much, Miss Yurika.
Thoma: But as this is just a processing fee... I think 600 Mora should cover it if I'm paying on their behalf? I'll treat you to dinner, too. How does that sound?
Paimon: That's not how you haggle! By all means, bargain the price down, but—
Yurika: Alright then. As you wish, Mr. Thoma. I will make a record.
Thoma: Hee-hee, much obliged.
Thoma: Missing text (1118357362)
Paimon: What!? She went from two million down to 600? There's something seriously wrong with people's sense of finance around here!
Traveler: I think it's about more than the Mora.
Thoma: Hehe, it's not as mind-boggling as you think. "Processing fee" is just a figure of speech.
Thoma: The way some here at the agency see it, the fees are easy money, so it becomes a question of how much they can make.
Thoma: So when the day comes that some poor merchant from overseas with more money than sense gets stuck here and needs to apply for residency...
Paimon: Then they'll milk them for all they're worth!
Thoma: Exactly. It's at times like this that having a local friend really comes in handy.
Traveler: That's blatant oppression against outlanders...
Thoma: Yes, but when you're an outlander in Inazuma, far from home, in this closed-nation era, there's very little that can be done about it.
Thoma: The most that overseas merchants can do to look after themselves is stick together.
Thoma: That's how the International Trade Association came about.
Paimon: So it's a trade association built by and for outlanders?
Thoma: Yep, and as well as advancing commercial interests, the association provides help, support, and structure for outlanders trying to survive on Ritou.
Thoma: Essentially, it's an association devoted to both commercial excellence and survival skills.
Traveler: So how would an outlander ever get to meet...
Paimon: *sigh* Sounds like just stayin' alive is an achievement when you're an outlander in Inazuma...
Thoma: I see... so this is the real purpose of your trip. Yes, given that you are outlanders, it's certainly a lofty aspiration.
Thoma: After all, the Raiden Shogun is the most exalted and revered one in all of Inazuma. She is a deity who reigns on high, while all other life gazes up in awe.
Traveler: That may well be...
Thoma: ...
Thoma: I was going to say, nothing is set in stone when it comes to who you will encounter in this world. Who's to say you won't happen to run into the Raiden Shogun one day after lunch...
Paimon: Uh-huh... And is that likely...?
Thoma: Okay, I'll give it to you straight. I know of a way to introduce you to the Raiden Shogun.
Paimon: Really!? Wow, the Ritou fixer is better connected than we thought!
Thoma: Ahem, hehe — I mean, it will take all the resources I have at my disposal, but it can be done. However, before we get there...
Thoma: Connections come at a high price, you understand?
Paimon: Ugh, not you too!
Thoma: Hahaha! No, no... In this instance, when I say price, I'm not talking about Mora.
Thoma: In fact, there's no real cost, as such. It's just that... if this is something you really want, you'll have to agree to help other people solve some of their problems first.
Thoma: I like to do things in a way that keeps everybody happy. It's my own personal rule for dealing with situations like this.
Paimon: Sounds very reasonable to Paimon! You're the man in the middle, so you have to trade favors to keep everyone indebted to you.
Traveler: The fixer works in mysterious ways...
Thoma: Heh... Why do I get the feeling you're making me out to be some sort of crook... Uh, never mind.
Thoma: Here's the situation. As I touched upon earlier, the members of the International Trade Association are constantly struggling to survive.
Thoma: Recently, things seem to have gotten more difficult than ever for them. So just go and check things out, see if there's any way you can help.
Thoma: The head of the association is called Kurisu, and he's a good friend of mine. Go talk to him, I'll wait for you here.
Traveler: So, what's the job?
Traveler: I still have to find a way!
Traveler: The Raiden Shogun feels further away than ever...
Traveler: Doesn't anyone push back?
Traveler: Reminds me of someone else's strange relationship with Mora...
Traveler: That is a major discount...

## Talk 3

Kurisu: Oh? Hello there, you must be seeking refuge with the International Trade Association. The Outlander Affairs Agency took you for all you're worth, I suppose.
Traveler: Very nearly...
Kurisu: Ah, good, that's a relief. *sigh* ...You need to be careful, or you'll find yourself losing your savings all at once.
Paimon: We heard the association has been having some difficulties lately. Is that true?
Kurisu: Yes... left, right, and center. Obstacles at every turn. But that's nothing new for us.
Paimon: The Sakoku Decree certainly makes things difficult for anyone who wants to come here from overseas.
Kurisu: But it's not the root cause of our woes. The Sakoku Decree might restrict our scope of activity, but in and of itself it doesn't stop us from being able to enjoy a comfortable existence.
Kurisu: No, what's really squeezing us outlander merchants dry is...
Kurisu: ...those Mora-grubbers from the Kanjou Commission.
Paimon: Oh, of the three Commissions, that's the one that oversees everything on Ritou, isn't it?
Kurisu: That's right. They impose astronomical tax rates, unbelievable regulations, and that's not the worst of it...
Kurisu: They just issued a new Tax Decree recently that, for some reason, completely changes the way we pay our taxes. It used to be Mora, but now it's something called Crystal Marrow.
Paimon: Crystal Marrow...? What's that?
Kurisu: Something that most of us in the association had never heard of before either, until the new decree came along.
Kurisu: Eventually, one of the older Liyue merchants recalled that he once shipped a batch of it to Snezhnaya in his youth.
Kurisu: So in order to pay our taxes, we began an arduous search for this Crystal Marrow.
Kurisu: But then we found we'd only managed to create a bigger problem for ourselves. The rising demand for Crystal Marrow drove the price higher and higher...
Kurisu: Now, there's only one vendor who even has it in stock. We can't get hold of it anywhere else...
Paimon: Uh... isn't that what they call a monopoly?
Kurisu: Exactly. So this vendor keeps pushing the price up, and we have no choice but to buy from them because the Tax Decree forces us to...
Kurisu: It's a vicious cycle, the consequence of which is that our taxes will soon exceed our profits... and once that happens...
Traveler: This is absurd treatment.
Kurisu: We've tried communicating with the commission directly...
Kurisu: But this is a nation where the cries of a few struggling merchants will never be heard over the ever-present roar of thunder...
Kurisu: *sigh* Fontaine, my dear homeland... I miss you an awful lot at the moment...
Paimon: Sounds awful, they're really bleeding them dry.
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, what do you think we should do?
Traveler: Try our best to negotiate with the Kanjou Commission?
Paimon: But Kurisu's the head of the association and even he hasn't had any luck. Not to mention, we're outlanders too...
Kurisu: Right, and besides... I think this may well be the fate they've ordained for us.
Paimon: Okay, well we could try tackling the problem by going to the other party involved...
Kurisu: *sigh* That vendor...
Kurisu: I've actually done business with him in the past, but after a point, he stopped contacting us. I have no idea where he sources the stuff...
Paimon: Hmm... Well, it definitely sounds like he's being unfair. How do we find him? We could go talk to him and see if he lets anything slip.
Kurisu: Hey, that's a pretty good idea! Since you're not affiliated with the association and you're new to Ritou, he may just let his guard down.
Kurisu: If I remember correctly, our usual meeting point with him is under a tree by the coast in the residential district. See if you can find him there.
Paimon: Got it! We're on the case!
Traveler: The vendor does sounds like a fishy character.
Traveler: Can't you discuss the situation with the Kanjou Commission?
Traveler: Luckily, we had a friend with us.

## Talk 4

Werner: Hm? I don't think I recognize you, are you new arrivals?
Traveler: Yes, we just arrived.
Werner: Haha, very funny. Real "Fixers" don't need to refer to themselves that way. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
Werner: So. What do you need with me?
Traveler: Where do you source your goods?
Werner: The sheer nerve! You don't go around asking questions like that! If I gave you my sources, I might as well hand you the whole darn business!
Werner: Trade secret, got it? You know what "trade" and "secret" mean, right? Tsk.
Paimon: This guy's got a bad attitude...
Traveler: Can you... reduce your prices?
Werner: Hah! Are you even buying!? ...Ohh, I see what's going on here. Kurisu and his associates sent you here to try and plead their case, didn't they?
Werner: Heh, they're wasting their time. The price is non-negotiable, not by a single Mora.
Paimon: Hey, what's your problem!?
Werner: Get out of here, go on. Tell them they're lucky to be buying from me in the first place, and they ought to be more grateful. If it weren't for me, they'd be in seriously hot water.
Paimon: What are we gonna do? There's no talking to this guy...
Traveler: Time to get the real fixer on the case...
Paimon: Good idea. Let's check back in with him.
Traveler: Let's go talk to Thoma.
Traveler: You don't recognize me? But I'm the fixer 'round these parts!

## Talk 5

Thoma: Hm? That was quick... You resolved it already?
Paimon: Um, actually we're having a little trouble...
Traveler: You're going to have to help us help you.
Thoma: Oh? Well, by all means, tell me what you need. I'll help as much as I can.
Thoma: Getting you to go fixing things when you've only just arrived is quite a demand.
Traveler: What do you know about Werner?
Thoma: Oh, that guy? I'm familiar.
Thoma: He used to be a bit of a sorry sight, selling shells that he'd collect on the beach just to get by. But he seems to have suddenly shot up in the world recently.
Thoma: I can only assume he must have found himself a patron after leaving the International Trade Association.
Paimon: Huh? You're saying he used to be a member of the International Trade Association? So he's an outlander, too?
Thoma: Yes... couldn't you tell when you spoke to him?
Traveler: Seemed like a Mondstadter to me.
Thoma: That's right, Werner was born in Mondstadt, then went into the shipping business, trading between Liyue and Inazuma.
Thoma: When Inazuma closed to the outside world, he was one of a group of outlanders that ended up stranded on Ritou.
Paimon: Huh, what a bummer...
Thoma: The International Trade Association was initially very generous to him, but over time, with decree after decree, the association members found it increasingly difficult to make ends meet...
Paimon: So, he left the association and turned his back on them!
Thoma: Haha, I'm sure it's more nuanced than that. I believe even the most ungrateful and cold-hearted of people still have some amount of gratitude and warmth left in them somewhere.
Traveler: Got it.
Paimon: Really? Is that all you need to know?
Thoma: Well then, it sounds like you may have found a way in with him.
Traveler: I'll go back and talk to him again.
Traveler: At least, I didn't get the impression he was a local.

## Talk 6

Werner: What are you doing back here? Just 'cause I got plenty of time on my hands doesn't mean I want to waste any of it talking to you.
Traveler: Time on your hands... Some would call that a form of freedom.
Werner: Huh? Where's this coming from...
Traveler: A Dandelion Wine would sure be nice on a day like this...
Traveler: A bard's serenade would be perfect right now...
Traveler: It was the wind that led me back here to you.

## Talk 7

Werner: ...Mondstadt... You're talking about... Mondstadt?

## Talk 8

Werner: Goodness, I can sense it now. So familiar, but I can't remember the last time I was there...
Werner: Ah, the scent of Mondstadt... Oh, how it takes me back...
Traveler: May the Anemo Archon protect you.
Werner: *sigh* My hometown... The home of freedom...! How I long to go back and visit...
Paimon: Ooh, it's working...
Werner: Ah... Oh — ahem! So, trying to play my heartstrings like a lyre are you? I know what you're up to.
Traveler: Close your eyes...
Werner: Huh? What is this, what are you up to now?
Paimon: Just close your eyes already!
Traveler: Listen closely... doesn't it sound familiar...?
Werner: You mean... the sound of the ocean?
Traveler: Cheap 'n' tasty chop suey!
Werner: *gasp* Liyue Harbor! I can see it so clearly! Oh, and the sound of the waves, the calls of the merchants...
Traveler: May the flames of virtue spread to all...
Werner: Xiao Lanterns! Haha, I'm right there, at the Lantern Rite! Oh... look at them, floating up into the sky!
Paimon: This guy has a really active imagination... either that or he really does miss Liyue Harbor...
Traveler: ...and never be extinguished!
Traveler: Grilled Tiger Fish, get it while it's hot!
Traveler: Let the Wind lead.

## Talk 9

Werner: *sigh* Liyue, Liyue...

## Talk 10

Werner: Wait... Stop, that's enough... Don't make me relive it any more, my poor heart can't take it...
Traveler: A lot of people out there sympathize with the position you're in.
Werner: You mean... the folks from the International Trade Association... And I suppose they are far from home, just like me.
Werner: Often, I'll sneak down to the shore at night and listen to the sound of the waves... I like to imagine it's the voice of my hometown, carried across the ocean.
Werner: I've run into folks from the association more than a few times doing just that, but I always hide my face and slip away...
Werner: *sigh* Don't you think I've wanted to talk things through with them, and free myself from this anguish?
Paimon: Um... well, no one's stopping you, so...
Werner: They're so resilient. None of them had anyone else to rely on, so they rallied together, committed to finding a way to survive... But I couldn't do it, I'm not strong enough...
Werner: So... I caved... Those people, they'd make the smallest of promises, offer the most measly benefits, and I'd do whatever they asked of me... and make Mondstadters look like the worst people in the world...
Traveler: Who are "those people"?
Werner: ...Alright, I'll tell you the whole story. It's eating me up inside and I can't take it anymore.
Paimon: You're ready to talk now?
Traveler: The International Trade Association will protect you.
Werner: But I betrayed them... I can't show my face there...
Paimon: Ugh, c'mon you scaredy-cat! Look, you messed up, but now it's time to make things right!
Paimon: So, come on, get it off your chest. What's the deal here?
Werner: It's a scheme by the tax-collection ashigaru. Keijirou and his companions.
Werner: They start by overtaxing the merchants, then take the extra Crystal Marrow they receive and stockpile it.
Werner: Once the merchants run out of places to buy Crystal Marrow, they get me to sell that extra stock back to the merchants at an extortionate price, with the proceeds going to the tax-collection ashigaru.
Paimon: It's just... it's plain evil, gouging them like this.
Werner: I'm their puppet, yes... but my cut is a tiny fraction of what we take in total. It's barely enough for me to live on.
Traveler: We need evidence.
Werner: Evidence? Hmm... You're right, without conclusive evidence, he will never admit it.
Werner: Now that I think about it, whenever I report back to him after a sale, he always heads to the same place. It's always made me suspicious...
Werner: As it happens, I handed some Mora over to him not long ago. I can show you where he went if you want.
Paimon: Really? Well, then there's no time to lose! Let's go.
Traveler: Come get a drink with your friends from the association.
Traveler: A lot of people have supported you in the past.

## Talk 11

Werner: Keijirou! It's him!
Paimon: After him!

## Talk 12

Werner: What could he be doing at a place like this...
Paimon: It looked like he buried something over there, didn't it? Why don't we take a look?

## Talk 13

Paimon: Whoa, it's... a ledger...
Paimon: Boring... Paimon thought he'd hidden a big pile of Mora here.
Traveler: Ah yes, the real reason Paimon came along.
Paimon: Ehehe, yeah...
Werner: Let me take a look here...
Werner: Aha, yes. This is what we're looking for. A clear and complete record of every single transaction, each one proof of his guilt.
Paimon: Great! Well, now we have our hard evidence, let's go tell Kurisu the good news, shall we?
Werner: Ah, um... I—I'll say goodbye to you here, then.
Paimon: Huh? You aren't gonna come with us?
Werner: I... I need a little more time before I'm ready to face the head of the association. I'm sorry.
Paimon: *sigh* Poor Werner's a pretty awkward guy, huh...
Traveler: Even if we did find Mora, we would give it to the trade association.

## Talk 14

Kurisu: But we really don't have anything left. If this keeps up, our sales will come in at a loss. There'll be nothing left for us to do but starve...
Keijirou: You know the decree. The rules are the rules. No discounts, no exceptions — and no excuses!
Traveler: You're the one making a mockery of the rules here, Keijirou!
Keijirou: Hmm? And who are you? Another new member of the association?
Paimon: It just so happens that we found your little ledger. So now we're here to tell everyone all about how you embezzled Crystal Marrow to sell it right back to the tax payers!
Kurisu: Huh? Is this true!?
Harrison: You've been swindling us!
Keijirou: Well, uh... You see... The t—taxes, uh...
Kurisu: Let me take a look at the ledger.
Kurisu: Text on a black screen: Kurisu reads aloud every entered transaction in full.
Kurisu: Well would you look at that... Every payment the association has made is right here in your personal ledger.
Kurisu: So, Mr. Keijirou, it seems you have some explaining to do. How shall we settle this, hmm?
Keijirou: Hmph! So you think you can use this against me do you? I—It's quite obvious that I'm merely trying to earn a modest living for myself, like anyone else...!
Kurisu: Word has it that samurai in the commission place great importance on reputation and prestige... Though, I'm sure commission members won't blame you once word gets out...
Keijirou: Huh? Is that a threat? Are you threatening me!?
Kurisu: No, not at all. I'm simply stating that it would be quite a pity if an illustrious gentleman such as yourself were to have their reputation tarnished.
Keijirou: Uhh... W—Well even if what you say is true, what do you suggest we do about it...?
Kurisu: I believe you still have a quantity of Crystal Marrow in your possession, correct?
Kurisu: Perhaps that Crystal Marrow could be used as compensation for the recent tax hike, and us merchants could finally have some more breathing room.
Paimon: Is that it?
Keijirou: Hmph, do you have any idea the hoops I had to jump through to get the Crystal Marrow and keep it hidden!? Ugh, fine! In that case, I'll send it over to you today.
Paimon: And not even an ounce of shame for his actions...
Harrison: So that's it!? My shop's been closed for weeks now — I've even had to ask my friends to help bail me out! What about my losses!?
Kurisu: Come on, Harrison! We've already struck a good deal here...
Harrison: I'm sick of being pushed around like this! I won't let him off so easily!
Kurisu: Harrison!
Katsuie: Hey! What's all this racket? Does someone dare question the decree?
Keijirou: Ah, Chief. You've arrived.
Katsuie: What was all the commotion I heard just now?
Keijirou: Oh, we were just discussing a minor tax issue. I do my utmost to lend them a helping hand, but they're never grateful.
Harrison: A helping hand!? The only thing you're doing is stuffing your greedy pockets with our hard-earned wealth. I assure you that Hiiragi Shinsuke will hear of this!
Katsuie: Oh? And you dare to utter the Commissioner's name? You outlanders have no respect for the rules.
Katsuie: Seize the merchants! We will resolve this dispute back at headquarters!
Paimon: Uh-oh, this is going in a bad direction...
Thoma: Gentlemen, gentlemen. Come now, is there any need for this? If there's a dispute to resolve, let's get a drink and talk it over.
Keijirou: Who are you supposed to be? And why in my right mind would I join you for a drink?
Paimon: Ha! You never heard of the fixer!?
Traveler: Context, Paimon, context...
Thoma: Here's my card...
Katsuie: Huh... you're from the Yashiro Commission?
Thoma: Shh...
Katsuie: Hmph, well, this is Kanjou Commission territory. However powerful the Yashiro Commission may be, you have no business meddling in Ritou's affairs.
Thoma: Of course not. Of course not. Still, perhaps you could show the young lady of our clan some courtesy...
Thoma: You wouldn't want your names showing up in a petition to the shogun, would you?
Katsuie: That fan... the Shirasagi Himegimi.
Katsuie: ...I don't need any trouble with her. Okay, let's forget all this. It'll give us one less thing to worry about.
Keijirou: But Chief...
Katsuie: Enough! We're leaving.
Thoma: Let's get dinner one day soon, gentlemen. My treat. I insist.
Thoma: Eh, no response, huh... I suppose that bridge is well and truly burned, then.
Kurisu: Thank you so much, Thoma... But I'm sorry your relationship with the Kanjou Commission had to suffer for our sake...
Thoma: #Haha. Hey, hey, I was joking. It's a small price to pay and you're more than welcome. If there's anyone you should be thanking, it's the Traveler. {F#She's}{M#He's} the one who found a way to turn things around.
Thoma: If nothing else, I'm sure the tax-collection ashigaru will tread a little more carefully in future.
Paimon: Thoma... what was all that—
Thoma: Shh... Not here, too many people listening, haha. Let's move somewhere else.
Traveler: That title doesn't have any weight with these people.

## Talk 15

Thoma: Corruption seems rife in the Kanjou Commission, they truly are rotten to the core... *sigh*
Thoma: Alright. Time for me to answer your questions. What would you like to know?
Traveler: Tell me about the Yashiro Commission.
Thoma: Haha, straight to the point. Let me re-introduce myself.
Thoma: I belong to the Kamisato Clan of the Yashiro Commission on Narukami Island. I'm an attendant of the Shirasagi Himegimi.
Paimon: Ugh, you've been keeping your true identity a secret from us this whole time!
Paimon: So, the Yashiro Commission. Guessing that's another branch of the Tri-Commission?
Thoma: Correct. The Kamisato Clan is the head of the Yashiro Commission, who manage ceremonial and cultural affairs. I'd go into more detail on what exactly that covers, but I'm not even sure myself.
Thoma: I'm just someone who was fortunate enough to be taken in by the Kamisato Clan. My role is to take care of the daughter of the clan — Kamisato Ayaka, also known as the Shirasagi Himegimi.
Paimon: Seems like she must be super-famous in Inazuma, given the reaction of those guys just now.
Thoma: Hahaha... Oh, most definitely. She's graceful, dignified, and kind-hearted, too. The people of Inazuma quite adore Miss Kamisato.
Thoma: Her fame even somewhat eclipses that of her older brother, Kamisato Ayato, despite the fact that he is the current head of the clan.
Thoma: I suppose those who treat others with compassion earn themselves the same treatment in return. Miss Kamisato's situation certainly seems to attest to that. Take me, for example — I'm just an attendant, and yet she treats me as an equal, as she would a friend.
Traveler: So where did this "fixer of Ritou" thing come from?
Thoma: You're asking the right questions. And to be honest, I don't want to keep you in the dark any more than is necessary.
Thoma: Firstly, you should know that being a fixer is not something you can fake. I spent the better part of a month tirelessly building up a network of relationships on the island, and I got to know Captain Beidou during that time, too.
Paimon: Still pretty good going for just a month's work!
Thoma: Haha, well, maybe I have a slight knack for schmoozery. But the main thing was, I had to make sure I'd be in time to receive you when you arrived.
Thoma: Inazuma may have closed off to the outside world, but that hasn't stopped a lot of people from hearing about your feats in Mondstadt and Liyue.
Thoma: So, when Miss Kamisato heard of your intention to come to Inazuma, she began looking forward to your arrival with great anticipation. She's excited to find out whether the rumors are true...
Thoma: ...that is, that you have what it takes to change the tide of the times.
Paimon: Change the tide of the times?
Thoma: In the test that I gave you earlier, although there were a few hiccups at the end, it was you who found the way to turn the situation around.
Thoma: Navigating powerful people, using their character flaws to your advantage... it's just what Miss Kamisato had hoped to see.
Thoma: With your help... even the Vision Hunt Decree—
Traveler: I never offered to help.
Thoma: ...Ah.
Thoma: Hmm, that's an unexpected development. Perhaps our sources were misleading...
Traveler: I have one goal here: to meet the Raiden Shogun.
Thoma: ...Yes, of course. I completely understand, and as agreed, I shall help set that up for you.
Paimon: Huh, Thoma sure didn't put up much of a fight...
Thoma: Hah... Well, my work on Ritou is done, so I suppose this is goodbye for now.
Thoma: Oh, one more thing — this Invitation Letter is for you... When you get to Narukami Island, you can find me at Komore Teahouse, as per the letter.
Thoma: Good luck with everything. See you soon.
Paimon: Missing text (3424606642)
Paimon: Thoma's not such a bad guy, huh. We should get going.
Traveler: But...
Paimon: Huh? What's up?
Traveler: Outlanders are unable to leave Ritou.
Paimon: Oh, right! Paimon forgot all about that!
Paimon: Wait, so... did Thoma forget that, too?
Traveler: I think perhaps not...
Paimon: Darn it! Grr, no wonder he was so matter-of-fact about the whole thing!
Paimon: As soon as we get off Ritou, Paimon's going straight to Komore Teahouse to settle the score!
Paimon: Ugh, well, guess we should give it a try. Let's head to the border and see how far we get.
Traveler: This must be the next part of his "test."
Traveler: There is one problem...
Traveler: I refuse.
Traveler: So as her attendant... are we helping you or her...?
Traveler: Tell me about the Shirasagi Himegimi.
