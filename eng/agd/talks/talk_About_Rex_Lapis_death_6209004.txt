Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Changshun: Yes, I heard about that down the grapevine...
Changshun: Liyue's economic boom could never have happened without the contributions of Rex Lapis. Even our coins, Mora, are named after him.
Changshun: There isn't a single businessperson in Liyue that doesn't worship him, and not a single transaction goes ahead that is not to his glory.
Changshun: So now this has happened... It's going to be cataclysmic for the business world. Things might already be changing as we speak.
