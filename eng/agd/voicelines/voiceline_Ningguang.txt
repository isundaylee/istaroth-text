# Ningguang Voicelines

## Hello
I am Ningguang, Tianquan of Qixing. You wish to trade? You be my personal bodyguard, and I will show you how to get ahead in Liyue.

## Chat: Antiques
Even if an antique is priceless, the happiness it brings lasts for only the moment that you obtain it.

## Chat: Trade War
In a trade war, the perfect hunter leaves no trace.

## Chat: Investments
We should look for a new investment. Mora doesn't grow on trees.

## When It Rains
Huh, it's raining. Fetch an umbrella for me, would you?

## When It Snows
Nothing more than regular snowfall. One day I'll take you to see the "snow" that falls over Liyue.

## When the Sun Is Out
Calm weather? Do not trust your eyes. Your eyes can lie to you.

## When the Wind Is Blowing
Gales like this can be the demise of fishermen, not to mention... Heh, never mind.

## Good Morning
Morning. Report your affairs, in order of priority.

## Good Afternoon
Liuli Pavilion or Xinyue Kiosk. Which would you prefer to go to for lunch?

## Good Evening
The tea house has no more rooms? Then come, sit in the Jade Chamber... if you can afford the price.

## Good Night
Sure. Go rest. If anything important comes up, I will be sure to send for you.

## About Ningguang: Worldview
Be it simple price negotiation or a full-blown trade war, momentum and bargaining chips are but minor factors. To win, you need to be first to find out what cards your opponent is holding.

## About Ningguang: Impression
Your impressions of me have changed? Haha, well, at first I required your strength, so naturally I had to be as cordial as possible. But now that we are partners bound by contract, we may do away with such pretentious formalities.

## About Us: Rumors
I suppose you've heard enough rumors about me. Hehe... What kind of person am I? I shall leave that for you to decide... Of course, your judgment will become a part of the rumor.

## About Us: Observing
You've been with me for some time now. Have you learned to observe? Then observe me. Observe me right down to my very core.

## About Us: Jade Chamber
Come forward, stand beside me. Do you see the Jade Chamber? At first it was just a room, and now it clouds Liyue. When the time comes that it hangs above all of the seven nations, you shall stand by my side on that day too.

## About the Vision
There's no need to use a Vision in affairs that Mora can solve. As far as affairs only a Vision can solve go, I know of only one...

## Something to Share: Banker
Gamblers always place their bets on the next dice roll... But the bankers always have the last laugh, and they never touch a single die.

## Something to Share: Goal
The departure of Rex Lapis will be no small test for both the Qixing and the city of Liyue. Seldom has any matter kept me tossing and turning at night like recent events.
Nevertheless, I shall not lose sight of my goal. There will come a day when the shadow cast by the Jade Chamber reaches every end of Teyvat.

## Interesting Things
In Liyue's ancient texts, there's no shortage of mentioning the beauty of the glaze lily, but in the modern era, the flower is on the brink of extinction. Now they can only be found in Yujing Terrace, and as such come with a hefty price tag.

## About Beidou: Fines
That... captain. She clearly receives the adoration of many, but will always be the first to disregard the rules. The fines she has paid would be enough to buy her a whole new ship...

## About Beidou: Attitude
Perhaps you've never heard me speak like this. All that can be said has been said — both the good and the bad — but she still does as she pleases. Forget it. Keep Beidou out of my sight.

## About Zhongli
Zhongli... Of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. He's very versed in a great deal of affairs. Although... such excellent pawns are of no use to me until I know their weaknesses.

## About Xingqiu
The second son of the Feiyun Commerce Guild. People like him can't stand the sight of me, which is only to be expected. I have no intention of troubling him either. Those who have different beliefs should not work together.

## About Xiangling
That girl from Wanmin Restaurant... Her suspicion towards me is always written all over her face... Hehe, I wonder what face she would make if only she knew how much I helped finance that restaurant...

## About Ganyu
One cannot afford to be overly reliant on others — even when it comes to Ganyu. There is a Liyue saying which goes, "even the most meticulous can fall prey to happenstance." When there are important affairs to deal with, it is always safer to investigate and resolve them personally.

## About Yaoyao
I presume you mean the girl whom Ganyu has taken under her wing. Do not worry, I have no plans to make this matter public. I am content to extend some leniency to the odd bit of mischievous maneuvering by that boat captain. One thing, though — Yaoyao seems to have become somewhat enamored with seafood lately. You should try to convince her to include some more fruits and vegetables in her diet.

## About Keqing
The Yuheng... She has changed a lot recently. But is Liyue better off with the Yuheng we have now, or the Yuheng we used to know? Only time will tell.

## About Jean
The Acting Grand Master of Mondstadt, a strict and impeccable woman. Her flawless etiquette knows no fault, even her letters are meticulously written and creased according to the prescribed rules. It is such easily overlooked details that offer a glimpse into the true qualities of one's character.

## About Yanfei
Yanfei? I suppose you could say she's a dear rival of mine... Were she not so deft at explaining the meanders of the law and providing her clients with all sorts of cunning suggestions, it would take me many more months to identify existing loopholes in the legal codices and tighten them one by one.

## About Shenhe
How is Miss Shenhe doing as of late? Please, look out for her whenever you can. I am most grateful to both of you for your assistance with rebuilding the Jade Chamber. Ahem, and on a more personal note — please know that if you are ever free, a cup of the finest tea will always be waiting for you here.

## About Yun Jin
Yun Jin... Are you able to appreciate her performances? It might be difficult at first, but I would encourage you to give it a chance. The reason I decided to invest into her opera troupe is quite simple: Elegant art forms like these deserve to be passed down to future generations.

## About Yelan
She's a very interesting character. I can say with the utmost confidence that she is someone I trust unreservedly. She handles herself impeccably, which means she stays beyond reproach. Hehe, since you both have high intelligence in common, hopefully you will get along very well.

## About Xianyun
#I plan to have Lady Xianyun over for a casual conversation over tea in a few days. I happen to have in my possession a number of mechanical devices, and I would be most interested to hear her insights on their design and use. It would also be a fine opportunity to hear about her experiences as an adeptus adapting to a new life in Liyue Harbor. All I require now is a suitable candidate to deliver the invitation to her on my behalf... Would you be interested, Traveler?

## More About Ningguang: I
Seeing as it's you, there's no need to keep up the formalities. You can be a little more casual. But I still ask that you respect my time. If you have something to say, be concise — I have no time to waste.

## More About Ningguang: II
I've always believed that children are the most naive and innocent. The reports they give me are of the most value. So what about you? What will you have for me?

## More About Ningguang: III
I've been thinking about something lately. If I were to keep you in Liyue, perhaps... at the right time, I might be able to leverage this city to... For now, it's mere conjecture. I should really consider whether the investment is worth it some more.

## More About Ningguang: IV
You can learn from me, and use Mora to make things a little easier for yourself. But remember, relationships built on Mora can only be relied on for a time. Hehe... and that is why I have never brought Mora into our relationship.

## More About Ningguang: V
This is truly a great investment. Sure, no Mora has been made from it, but the time I've spent with you is already a solid return. Haha, seems I win again — I put my money on the right person.

## Ningguang's Hobbies
Care for a game of Liyue Millennial? It'll give me an opportunity to see exactly how good you are as a player.

## Ningguang's Troubles
Concerns? If I told you of the concerns of the Liyue Qixing, do you think your shoulders could bear the burden? And, if you ever made the mistake of mentioning them to others...

## Favorite Food
A slow-boiled soup of leftover chicken and pork bones drenched over some cabbage leaves. I have few culinary requirements. Having a few staple dishes like this is enough.

## Least Favorite Food
I've come across those who demand golden crab for every meal. Though it all seems so grandiose, I really have no desire for such frivolousness. If you're ever thinking of taking me out for such a dinner, you'd be better off just giving the Mora to me directly.

## Receiving a Gift: I
Mmm... You have surpassed my expectations, again.

## Receiving a Gift: II
With some things, if you haven't grasped the essentials, all the hard work in the world can go to waste... Know what I mean?

## Receiving a Gift: III
Ugh... It's the thought that counts.

## Birthday
#These are some of Liyue's finest brocades, woven from Silk Flowers. This one is for you, and this one... I hope that someday soon, you will be able to give it to your sister, and I hope that she'll like it. I wish you both a happy birthday.

## Feelings About Ascension: Intro
There's no style in resorting to violence. It's simply the worst of all the bad decisions you could make.

## Feelings About Ascension: Building Up
Cashing in time and Mora for power... Interesting. This shows their true value.

## Feelings About Ascension: Climax
What is it that you hold so dear that is making you so persistent...? No, don't tell me. Give me more time to understand you myself.

## Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion
I'm usually not so quick to place my trust in others, but it seems I will no longer be able to make such claims. You've done splendidly. If only I had more like you... No, perhaps... you alone are enough.

## Elemental Skill: I
It's nothing.

## Elemental Skill: II
Don't waste my time.

## Elemental Skill: III
Hmph! Give up.

## Elemental Burst: I
Your life is mine.

## Elemental Burst: II
Submit!

## Elemental Burst: III
Goodbye!

## Opening Treasure Chest: I
A keen eye.

## Opening Treasure Chest: II
We can't have treasure unaccounted for.

## Opening Treasure Chest: III
Wealth... why settle for less than more?

## Low HP: I
You dare to hit me?

## Low HP: II
I'll remember that.

## Low HP: III
Urgh!

## Ally at Low HP: I
You're out of moves.

## Ally at Low HP: II
Given the circumstances, I'm happy to help.

## Fallen: I
We are all but pawns...

## Fallen: II
The victor has been decided...

## Fallen: III
Is this the end of Tianquan?

## Light Hit Taken: I
Ugh... rude.

## Heavy Hit Taken: I
Ugh! You wait!

## Heavy Hit Taken: II
Ugh! Blood repays blood!

## Joining Party: I
Understood.

## Joining Party: II
Let's make haste.

## Joining Party: III
Don't disappoint me.
