Traveler: And you are...
Mansur: I'm a researcher from the Akademiya's Amu{RUBY#[S]Biology}rta, I came to the blacksmith's because I'm being oppre— uh, I mean, I'm doing some research for a paper I'm writing on air pollution.
Mansur: Anyway, I never imagined that I would develop such an interest in ironworking after having a look at it, and I unwittingly became Mr. Ahangar's apprentice...
Mansur: It seems a little too late to back out now. Mr. Ahangar adopted a lot of kids, but they all either became researchers or joined the Eremites.
Mansur: And yet somehow, a researcher like me who worries over their dissertation all day has now become the only heir to his craft...
Mansur: Still, I'm telling you, ironworking is a heck of a lot more fun than writing papers. Not only has my stamina improved, my hair's even stopped falling out.

Traveler: What do you plan to do next?
Mansur: Well, at the moment, I'm simultaneously keeping the serious air pollution problem at the blacksmith's from the Akademiya while prolonging my internship here with Mr. Ahangar...
Mansur: Mr. Ahangar looked quite pleased to finally have an apprentice. I can get by well enough on my wages, so I guess I'll just take it one step at a time for now.
