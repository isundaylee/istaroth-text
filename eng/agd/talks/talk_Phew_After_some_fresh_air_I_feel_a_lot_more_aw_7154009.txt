# Talk Dialog

Keqing: Phew... After some fresh air, I feel a lot more awake.
Traveler: Keqing, this gift envelope is for you.
Keqing: Thank you! I was actually in the middle of making one for you!
Keqing: But, uh... As soon as I sat down, work started to pile up. In the end, I only got a few words down...
Traveler: It's the thought that counts.
Keqing: Well, you deserve something substantial, too. I'll finish it soon.
Keqing: The matter with the boundary has been resolved, and Ningguang managed to cover it up in the name of a ritual, so we don't have to worry about mass panic...
Keqing: But, we still made quite the commotion that night, enough for some nearby hunters and mountain-dwellers to take notice.
Keqing: If anyone who caught a glimpse of fetor or the array start spreading senseless rumors, we could be in trouble...
Keqing: *sigh*... Look at me, talking about all this during the holiday season. You must be tired. Here, have some dim sum â€” it's fresh from Xinyue Kiosk.
Keqing: I have things to discuss with Ganyu soon, but once I'm done with my envelope, I'll make sure to get it to you.
Traveler: Still occupied with work?
Traveler: See you.
Keqing: #Happy Lantern Rite, Traveler. Goodbye!
