Traveler: About the Stove God...
Madame Ping: Well, now you know that the Moonchase Festival was instituted by Rex Lapis as a way of remember that friend of ours.
Madame Ping: You call him Guoba nowadays, do you not? Hehe, I suppose it was destiny that led Xiangling to rename the God of the Stove for a dish they both enjoyed.
Madame Ping: Take him around Liyue Harbor — you and Xiangling both — a little more, would you?
Madame Ping: I'm sure he would be gladdened to see Liyue Harbor as populous as it presently is.
