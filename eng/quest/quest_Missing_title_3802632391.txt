## Talk 1

Paimon: Speaking of which, this should be your abode, right, Fujin? It feels a bit different from the other adeptal abodes we've been in... How should Paimon put it... it feels more... pragmatic?
Paimon: There are no weird mechanisms or transparent floating bridges...
Fujin: I am very sorry... I was just too embarrassed before, and so never explained clearly.
Fujin: I cannot create new adeptal realms like the adepti of the south. "Carp's Rest" is no "abode." At best, it's just a "cave"...
Paimon: Cave, realm, whatever! They're all "abodes" where adepti live, aren't they? Still, we don't even know when you can turn back into your human form...
Lingyuan: All the power she accumulated has dispersed across this land. She will be unable to revert to human form for some time.
Lingyuan: I am the same way when I've exhausted my power. After Master died, the snow fell, melted, and then it fell once more after melting, and did so countless times before I could regain human form.
Paimon: Oh, so that's it... huh? Wait a sec, Lingyuan, you can turn into a person too!?
Fujin: Why, of course! There is much you two know not! Why, back then, on Mt. Yaojun, Lingyuan's looks were—
Lingyuan: Fujin. No need to speak of such things. It has nothing to do with the present topic.
Fujin: Eh? So, the whole thing about eating too many teacakes at the temple fair in human form, and crying to Herblord about brewing weight-loss tea...
Fujin: Or the incident where you accidentally drank the celebratory libations and hauled forest boars in to ask them "Who's prettier, me or Herblord?"... Ah! But I needn't speak of such things after all, do I?
Lingyuan: ...Fujin!
Paimon: Wow! After all that, Paimon's getting curious. What does your human form look like, Lingyuan? Would you be as blue as you are now? Or would you be... Uh, a slightly lighter shade?
Traveler: Now I'm curious too!
Lingyuan: I do not understand your curiosity. You are people too. If you are interested in human forms, just look at yourselves.
Fujin: #Hehe... Anyway, thank you, Traveler and Paimon. I never imagined the day would come when I would be able to talk to others like this...
Fujin: *cough*— As one has found oneself in such a joyous state of mind, one is willing to bestow protection upon you two for your journey, guaranteeing success and great fortune...
Paimon: ?
Fujin: ...Sorry, I got a bit carried away. I wanted to try being like those adepti, so I thought I'd try out a phrase or two...
Fujin: Anyway! I'll be staying here and praying for your journey to go smoothly.
Traveler: Lingyuan, could you turn human, just for a second?
Lingyuan: I refuse. Human bodies are weak. They lack fangs to rend and rip prey, and claws to hound and hunt enemies. I would not do such a thing unless commanded to by Fujin.
Traveler: A shame...
Traveler: We'll leave this to you, Fujin!
Fujin: ...Eh? R—Really? I—In that case, I think maybe we should just respect Lingyuan's wishes...?
Lingyuan: I do not have any wishes. If you have some, tell me so directly.

## Talk 2

Little Mao: Bluey, Bluey, you didn't tell me the ending to that story you were telling me last time!
Lingyuan: Yes. I remember. However, I've changed my mind.
Little Mao: "Changed your mind"? What's that supposed to mean?
Lingyuan: I'll leave the ending of the story... to you.
Little Mao: Ehhh!? C'mon, Bluey, that's cheating! You promised that you'd tell me a story if I told you one! How come I'm the one telling both stories now!?
Lingyuan: I'm just a simple-minded beast. I cannot think of a good ending.
Lingyuan: The ending I came up with was a bad ending. The story is also a bad story that wouldn't make anyone happy. So, I'll let you tell the ending of the story.
Little Mao: But that's still cheating!
Lingyuan: I do not deny that. As compensation, I can take you to see the hidden sights of Mt. Lingmeng.
Lingyuan: ...
Lingyuan: Don't make that face. I will give you special permission to... Sit on my back, for five minutes or so. Ten minutes will do, too.
Little Mao: In... In that case, then it's a deal! I'll think of an ending for the story...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Huh? Lingyuan, is that you?
Lingyuan: ...
Paimon: Ah, sorry! Are you hunting? Did we disturb you?
Lingyuan: I was not hunting. You did not disturb me either.
Paimon: Uh... Then were you just... spacing out? Like, thinking about tasty food and stuff?
Lingyuan: I wasn't thinking about you either. I was just thinking.
Paimon: Thinking... Hang on, wait! What did you mean by that first part!?
Lingyuan: #I am thinking about the question Traveler asked before.
Lingyuan: "If human activities are part of the laws of nature, how would you view humanity?"
Lingyuan: It has been too long since I last had contact with the humans constituting the settlement — I have not been there since Fujin and the snake left.
Paimon: Hey, you're making it sound like Little Mao doesn't count as a human!
Lingyuan: #Little Mao is a human that belongs to the settled humans, but is not a human who constitutes the settlement. You and Traveler "constitute" travel companions, but you do not "belong" to Traveler. That is the difference.
Traveler: You don't consider Little Mao a part of the social order?
Lingyuan: Not in full. Most human young are like this until they are completely absorbed by the order, just as it is in nature.
Lingyuan: It has been too long since I have been in contact with the humans who constitute the settlement. It could be because of hatred, fear, or maybe even both.
Traveler: Because they have encroached on the land that belongs to nature?
Lingyuan: I don't know.
Lingyuan: Or perhaps no obvious differences exist that separate "us" from "them," but I cannot be sure.
Lingyuan: The young of the humans walk with me. Similarly, a youngling of our kin walks with a human out of curiosity.
Paimon: Eh? A youngling of your kind?
Lingyuan: That child encountered a mortal in the mountains.
Lingyuan: So, I still cannot answer your question. I must continue to observe humanity.
Lingyuan: There are many things I do not understand. I will try to understand until I can answer your question, as I promised to.
Traveler: Because Fujin chose to sacrifice herself for them?
Traveler: I wouldn't be too sure...
Paimon: Hey! Don't say weird things like that!

## Talk 4

Little Mao: Listening to Mountain, it sounds like Fontaine's operas are pretty similar to ours!
Little Mao: Knights, magicians, brave warriors, and evil dragons, you kill me, I kill you, and in the end, everyone winds up dead!
Hautemontagne: What's important isn't the ending! It's the process — how you get there! Not every tragedy can be seen as a mere sequence of fight scenes!
Little Mao: Oh, oh! And the "Ray-more-young Golems" Mountain was just talking about sound really, really cool too! I wonder if they're bigger than Bluey?
Hautemontagne: Eh? Bluey?
Little Mao: Oh, right! I never told you about Bluey, did I... How about this? You tell me more about "Ray-more-young Golems," and I'll tell you about Bluey!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Wow! What do you know? We've already collected so much adeptal energy already!
Traveler: Well done me!
Paimon: According to what Fujin said before, all this adeptal energy should be used on the Votive Rainjade. That way, Qiaoying Village can reap the results next year!
Paimon: When that happens, Paimon'll have Uncle Luo prepare all kinds of amazing food for her! Let Paimon think... Mmm, like teacakes, squab, braised meatball, honey char siu, oooh, and, and...
Paimon: Oh right! And Chenyu Brew, of course! Paimon's gotta write all this down... eh? Wait, who's there?
Paimon: F—Fujin!?
Fujin: Hehe, sorry about that. I didn't scare you, did I?
Paimon: You can assume human form again!
Fujin: Yes! Did one not say that one was not seriously injured, and needed merely the briefest of rests to return to my favored form?
Fujin: Thank you both for gathering all that adeptal energy for the Rainjade as I rested. Next year's bountiful harvest will in no small way be thanks to your efforts.
Traveler: #Hehe, 'tis but a piffling trifle for one such as I, the Young Master!
Paimon: Though, now that you're back to your human form and don't need to lock yourself in that super-dark place anymore, what do you plan to do next?
Fujin: Yes... I haven't given much thought to that yet. Perhaps I should just walk around and have a look?
Fujin: Have a taste of today's teas, listen to today's operas, see the people of today... *ahem* I am sorry. I keep emphasizing "today," as though I'm some sort of horrid antique...
Fujin: Though, I really do like that word. The things I couldn't do in the past, I can do "today." The things that couldn't be achieved before, all those promises that couldn't be kept, they can all be made real "today."
Fujin: And then, I'd like to go to the Guili Assembly and have a look, and then to Liyue Harbor to see the people there, meet all those lovely folks they described, and of course, I'd like to see Herblord again...
Traveler: Want me to bring you around?
Paimon: Yeah! Paimon remembers that you said something about "not leaving clear water for too long" and "needing to use the adeptal realms in teapots to travel long distances."
Fujin: Hehe... Thank you for remembering that, and thank you for being willing to help me. However, I would still like to stay in Chenyu Vale a bit longer and enjoy the sights and sounds of my home.
Fujin: As for long-distance travel, let me think... Hmm, perhaps I should wait until Little Mao is all grown?
Paimon: That's way too long!
Fujin: I'm joking! Anyway, I do plan to stay here for a bit, and see if I can convince Lingyuan to go on the trip with me.
Fujin: #Oh, right! Traveler, one more thing before you go...
Fujin: You went through quite a lot on account of both myself, as well as Lingyuan. My adeptal energy is slowly recovering, so please allow me to give you a genuine blessing of protection for the road ahead.
Fujin: Hehe, that should do it! All set now!
Traveler: Thank you.
Fujin: #Well then, once again... Thank you, Traveler and Paimon. Thank you for everything you've done for me, and for Chenyu Vale.
Traveler: I don't really feel any different...
Fujin: Well, the skeins of fortune aren't to be read at a glance, you know!
Traveler: I'm happy to help.
Traveler: #As expected of one such as I, the Young Master!
Paimon: Hey! That bit's long since over, quit talking like that!

## Talk 6

Lingyuan: ...
Fujin: What's wrong, Lingyuan? You keep staring at me. Do I have food on my face or something?
Lingyuan: I was just thinking... No. It's nothing.
Lingyuan: Even if you and the snake both asked me to, I will never again take human form.
Fujin: Hehe. I haven't ever asked you to before, have I?
Lingyuan: ...Forget it. Let's go. Or did you not clamor to see the present tea garden?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Little Mao: Big Sis Fujin! Congratulations on returning to your former self!
Little Mao: I already heard about it from Bluey! Though she's always saying "The original form is the better form" and "I don't know why she wants to turn back into human form" and things like that, I can tell that she's happy too!
Little Mao: #I know you really like tea, Big Sis Fujin, so I'm gonna go ask Grandpa Lu to teach me to make teacakes! Once I master it, I'll make super delicious teacakes for you and Mr. Traveler!
Fujin: Hehe, thank you, Little Mao. In exchange for the teacakes... Yes, when the time comes, I'll tell you stories about Lingyuan's past.
