Traveler: In a good mood, I see?
Toltec: Indeed! Everything's looking up. It's quite astounding, really.
Toltec: You know, we have plenty of tribespeople who help escort Iktomisaurs to read the trends of the Ley Lines and phlogiston â€” including me, and I'm one of the better-spoken ones.
Toltec: The Ley Lines here in Natlan have never been as healthy as this. To be frank, every day I wake up and wonder if I'm not still dreaming.
Toltec: We owe that hero from Snezhnaya... or should I say Khaenri'ah, a debt of gratitude, and of the utmost respect.
Toltec: Of course, it's not just the Abyss that affects the Ley Lines. We still have work that must be regularly undertaken.
