# For the Same Land


## Talk 1

Paimon: It's been a few days since the battle. Hopefully the tribes are getting back to normal...
Paimon: The Flower-Feather Clan was hit the hardest, right? That's Chasca's tribe. Maybe we should check how everyone's doing.
Paimon: We might be able to help them out!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Wait, isn't that Iansan? Wonder what she's doing here...

## Talk 3

Iansan: Let's see... One of those guys was talking about being cold. Do you still remember him?
Iansan: It's not often that you see someone almost drown on dry land... Let's go talk to him.

## Talk 4

Traveler: (Found one! Now, we just need to borrow its identity.)

## Talk 5

Paimon: We're back... How are you feeling?
Atoco: Duarte...?
Traveler: (Step forward)
Atoco: How... How did you get here? Are you here to save me?
Paimon: It's working!
Iansan: Shhh...!
Iansan: What now?

## Talk 6

Atoco: No, wait... I failed... I...
Iansan: Oh no, he's getting suspicious.
Traveler: (Slam him hard)
Atoco: *violent coughing*
Atoco: *panting* Duarte...! Wait, you're not Duarte...
Atoco: How did I get here? Who are you people...
Izcalli: Atoco!
Atoco: Izcalli? What's going on? All I remember is the battle against the Abyss, and then... I was drowning, and a saurian that looked like Duarte saved me. How did I get here?
Black Screen Text: You explain the situation to Atoco.
Atoco: You went through all that for me? While all I did was to cause trouble for everyone. I'm so sorry...
Iansan: None of this is your fault. Maybe it's not my place to say this, but... Go easy on yourself. You deserve to move past what happened here... and what happened to Duarte.
Atoco: Th—Thank you... I appreciate that.
Iansan: Go on, get some rest. Izcalli, we'll leave him to you.

## Talk 7

Iansan: Seems like the key to getting through to them is whatever they cherish the most.
Iansan: Kind of like their last spark of hope... Now we know how to help the others!
Iansan: Let's take heart from this, and keep going.

## Talk 8

Iansan: We made it, Chief.
Mutota: #You're here, Iansan! Oh, and you must be Traveler and Paimon. I've heard a lot about you. I'm sure we'll have a much better time now with your help.

## Talk 9

Bahati: Cochitta is getting better, too!

## Talk 10

Yareche: So all those rumors about the Traveler really are true...

## Talk 11

Abundi: How's Ocotlan doing?

## Talk 12

Mutota: Chuychu, give me a hand for a sec—... Ah, right. Chuychu's not... She's not... here anymore.

## Talk 13

Paimon: So, in the end, The Captain still hasn't told us his real goal.
Paimon: He kind of reminds Paimon of someone we met recently... Oh, right! The Lord of the Night!
Paimon: They just seem so... tired, you know? Since they've both been alive for many centuries, do you think that's just what happens when you've been alive for too long...?

## Talk 14

Traveler: (Let out a low roar)
Atoco: You sense it, don't you? This place is dangerous...
Atoco: Still, hahaha... Hearing you make that noise reminds me of our first few battles together. You were such a little thing back then, and I also had no idea what I was doing...
Traveler: (He's still trapped in the hallucination.)

## Talk 15

Traveler: (Push him lightly from behind)
Atoco: Ah, you're going to carry me out of here, just like last time.
Atoco: Over a decade later, and you're still trying to save me. I can't believe you made it this deep underwater, but I'm so glad you found me...
Atoco: Once we're out of here, let's split a huge portion of Blazed Meat Stew, just like old times! I owe you for this...
Atoco: We're almost at the surface... People tried to tell me you were dead, you know. Hah, as if I'd let that happen. I promised to protect you. There's no way... no way...

## Talk 16

Atoco: I'm... drowning...

## Talk 17

Izcalli: My friend... Is he any better?
Iansan: We're working on it, but I wanted to ask... Does the name "Duarte" ring any bells for you?
Izcalli: Duarte? Oh yeah, I remember...
Izcalli: Duarte was the name of Atoco's saurian companion. Atoco almost drowned as a child, and Duarte was the one who saved him.
Izcalli: He dove deep into the water and used all his strength to carry Atoco back to the surface. It was pretty touch and go, but both of them made it in the end.
Iansan: That means we just need to bring Duarte here, and—
Izcalli: Well, you see... Duarte died four years ago during an Abyss invasion. He was helping evacuate injured warriors from the front lines, but fell to an ambush.
Traveler: ...Maybe we don't need the real Duarte.
Paimon: Wait, what do you mean?
Izcalli: You're right... Duarte didn't have many distinguishing features. I don't think he ever stood out next to the others.
Traveler: We just need to impersonate him.
Iansan: Based on the look on your face, I'm guessing you already have a plan.
Iansan: Alright, let's get to work... Oh, and thank you for the information. We'll do whatever we can to help your friend.
Izcalli: No problem. Thank you for looking out for him.
Traveler: What did Duarte look like?
Izcalli: He was a bit on the smaller side, but other than that, he was just your average Qucusaur.
Izcalli: Hold on, what are you planning?

## Talk 18

Izcalli: If only Duarte was still alive...

## Talk 19

Traveler: (Tap his head with your claw)
Iansan: Wait! Not so hard...
Atoco: Ah, that hurt... Duarte, you have to get out of here! There's something in the water!
Traveler: (That didn't work...)

## Talk 20

Traveler: (No reaction from Atoco... Maybe this saurian is too much of a far cry from his friend.)
Paimon: Based on what Izcalli told us, we need to find a Qucusaur.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Atoco: Wait, the battle! What happened? Did we beat that giant Abyss monster?
Izcalli: Hey, don't worry, we won.
Atoco: Phew... Thank goodness.

### Additional Talk 2

Cochitta: It's coming for me... It's gonna eat me...!
Iansan: It's okay, there's nothing to fear. Gosoythoth has lost. Nothing can hurt you anymore.
Cochitta: It's no use. It'll just come back... Nothing can stop it. Nothing can stop the Abyss!
Cochitta: It will devour everyone. Heh... One day, we'll all be reunited in the pit of its stomach.
Paimon: Maybe it's just Paimon, but she seems to be in even worse shape than Atoco.
Paimon: She can talk to us, but nothing she says makes any sense. She also seems really afraid...
Iansan: Afraid... is right.
Iansan: I wonder what triggered it... The battle against the Abyss? Or maybe, like Atoco, it's some deep-rooted fear, and the Abyss just made it worse.
Iansan: Alright, just like before — let's go see what we can learn about her past.
Mutota: Iansan, I heard you cured Atoco! I'm so relieved... Is there anything I can do to help? If you need extra hands, I can—
Iansan: Chief Mutota! Perfect timing, I was just looking for you. I wanted to ask you some questions...
Black Screen Text: You explain what you did to cure Atoco as you take Chief Mutota to a more secluded place to talk.
Mutota: I think you're on to something... The mental distress does seem to be connected to pre-existing fears and anxieties.
Mutota: Cochitta doesn't like it when people talk about her past, but the situation is urgent, so I guess I'll be the bad guy.
Mutota: Iansan, do you believe there are people in this world destined for battle?
Iansan: Yes, I get that feeling sometimes when I'm instructing a particularly gifted student. It's something like... "wow, you were born to play this sport."
Mutota: Then, what about people destined to be unfit for battle?
Iansan: What do you mean?
Mutota: When Cochitta was little, her parents died fighting the Abyss.
Mutota: She was only eleven or twelve at the time, and her brother even younger still. The two saw their parents collapse in a pool of blood as flames roared and spread all around them...
Mutota: Cochitta trained hard to become a warrior, but still found fighting abyss monsters too difficult to handle. She and her brother were left with severe trauma after the incident, pain and fear that they could not get over no matter what.
Paimon: But, isn't Cochitta one of the warriors who fought the Abyss? Didn't you find her unconscious out on the field?
Mutota: Yes, we did. You see, something changed within her several years ago when the Abyss attacked our tribe, and broke into her home.
Mutota: By the time the guards rushed to the scene, they found her standing there, weapon outstretched, hands trembling, her brother huddling behind her for safety...
Mutota: And the Abyss monster dead at her feet. She didn't even look at it, and just kept repeating the same thing over and over — "you're the only family I have left. I won't let anything happen to you."
Mutota: She became a completely different person after that. She earned a reputation as a very capable warrior, and fought countless battles against the Abyss.
Mutota: We all thought she overcame the trauma, and we were so happy for her, but now it seems like even if she buried it deep within herself, the fear still never left her.
Iansan: Maybe fighting the Abyss was her way of making sure she wouldn't lose anyone else.
Iansan: Maybe the thought of experiencing that pain again scared her more than the Abyss. On the outside, her choice to fight made her seem strong, but she never forgot the trauma of that night... The Abyss just brought it back to the surface.
Paimon: How can we help her?
Iansan: This one is tricky. If we can find the right opportunity, then—
Mutota: Cuallee?
Cochitta: ...
Cochitta: Cuallee... What are you doing with that weapon?
Cuallee: Show me the monster that hurt you!
Cuallee: I'll make it pay! I... I'm gonna protect you this time!
Mutota: Calm down, Cuallee. That monster is already—
Cuallee: I can do it! I don't care what it takes! I just want her to get better... She is the only family I have left!
Cochitta: Family...
Iansan: Hold on, Chief Mutota. Looks like Cochitta is responding to his words.
Cochitta: If Cuallee goes to battle... the Abyss will devour him...
Cochitta: I can't let that happen. I have to do something...
Cochitta: But, it's useless. No one can beat the Abyss. It's a death sentence, just like what happened to Mom and Dad...
Traveler: The Abyss isn't indestructible.
Cochitta: But I'm no warrior... I'm just a coward. Still... I have to protect Cuallee. What should I do?
Cuallee: Cochitta...
Traveler: I think you just need to fight it one more time.
Cochitta: Fight it... one more time?
Iansan: #Good idea, Traveler... Her fear of the Abyss runs deep, but she still has the will to fight.
Iansan: She just needs to defeat an Abyss monster by herself, and we can prove to her that the Abyss isn't indestructible, just like you said!
Iansan: I think it's worth a try. Plus, with us around, we can make sure she won't get hurt. Although, that also means finding an Abyss monster...
Mutota: Try checking the mountains to the north. A few fled in that direction after the battle.
Mutota: I dispatched a team to clear them out, so most of them should be gone. But, there might still be a few stragglers.
Iansan: Great! Then let's go right now. Cochitta, think you can make it?
Cochitta: There's no turning back. I have to face it, even if it will devour me whole...
Cuallee: I'm coming, too! I'm not letting my sister face this alone! Not anymore!
Iansan: Alright, then stick close. Let's go!
Traveler: You've defeated countless monsters already.

### Additional Talk 3

Mutota: Be careful out there. I expect you all to come back safe, alright?

### Additional Talk 4

Iansan: Found 'em... Let's get started.
Iansan: Everything alright, Cochitta? You don't have to force yourself to do this.
Iansan: How can we make this easier for her...? I guess we could wear them down first, but I think it's better to stand guard for now. We should wait for the right moment to intervene.
Cochitta: You...! You were the ones who killed them...!
Cochitta: (As a kid, I thought my parents were invincible. They were always so strong and gentle... They seemed like the most powerful people in the world.)
Cochitta: (But, I can still see the image of them collapsed at my feet that night — the raging fire, the smoke, the smell of blood, the sound of my brother's cries... It's all burned into my brain.)
Cochitta: (They told me to run, and I could see the fear in their eyes. I've been running from my fears ever since.)
Cochitta: (But, why didn't my parents run? It must have been because—)
Cuallee: You can do it!
Cochitta: (...Because of our family. When you have someone to protect, there's no backing down, no matter what.)

### Additional Talk 5

Cochitta: Phew...
Cochitta: Where are the rest? Where are they hiding?
Traveler: You defeated them.
Iansan: That last strike was absolute perfection! You pulverized them in a single hit.
Cochitta: That's impossible... They were gigantic beasts, crawling with eyes, ready to devour everything in sight...
Cochitta: No, wait... What am I saying? Abyss monsters are not actually that scary... I've defeated them before. I know I have...
Paimon: She's back to normal!
Cuallee: Cochitta!
Cochitta: What just happened?
Black Screen Text: You explain the situation to Cochitta.
Cochitta: That is... quite embarrassing. Sorry about that.
Cochitta: I've always envied warriors who don't get scared or feel lost. It really felt like I was getting stronger over the years, but in the end, maybe I never made any progress at all...
Iansan: It's important to listen to your limits. Just like in training, pushing too hard will only hurt you in the long run. Everyone needs time to rest.
Iansan: Besides, I have a feeling you won't have to face those fears alone anymore.
Cuallee: Even though we're both scared of monsters, you were always the one who stepped up to protect me, but not anymore. I'm gonna get stronger. From now on, we're in this together!
Cochitta: Is that so? Then I'll look forward to the day when you'll be all big and formidable.
Cochitta: I finally feel like myself again, and I couldn't have done it without you all. Thank you for everything.
Cochitta: I think I'll rest here for a bit. I don't think I can make it back to the tribe just yet...
Cuallee: I'll keep you company!
Iansan: Alright, then we'll head back. I made sure to check the surrounding area for monsters, and it's all clear, so take your time.
Iansan: Sometimes, our fears never truly leave us. But, tomorrow's a new day. As long as you keep moving forward, there will be better days to come.
Traveler: They are not coming back.

### Additional Talk 6

Cuallee: I'll fight by your side until every last monster is gone!
Cochitta: That's very brave of you. But, you know what would make me even happier? If this whole war would end tomorrow, so you would never have to fight at all.

### Additional Talk 7

Iansan: #That's two people down! You're an amazing problem-solver, Traveler! Probably a well-honed skill from all your travels, right?
Iansan: You really know how to give people hope! Ever since you came to Natlan, I've been feeling a lot better about our chances of winning this war!
Traveler: You helped a lot, too.
Paimon: Yeah! Honestly, Paimon was at a complete loss when she saw so many sick people on the hot-air balloon platform.
Paimon: We only found a solution this time because you kept your cool and took control of the situation. You deserve most of the credit!
Iansan: Haha, well, who am I to turn down such a nice compliment!
Iansan: Most people say the first step is the hardest. But, it's not actually all that hard. Exaggerating the difficulty in your own head is where the fear comes in.
Iansan: "I'll never get it," or "Might as well not try"... I hear that kind of talk all the time. But, if you break your goal into smaller parts, the first steps might actually turn out to be the easiest.
Paimon: Whoa, you're right! That makes a lot of sense...
Iansan: Just like when I told you to eat less meat and drink more kale juice.
Iansan: You probably heard that and thought... "I can never eat meat again. I have to drink kale juice for every meal. I'll practically starve..."
Traveler: That's why Paimon was so against it.
Paimon: Hee-hee...
Iansan: In reality, all it takes to start is eating two fewer servings of Blazed Meat Stew and adding some kale juice for nutrition. That's it! It's not about making drastic changes all at once.
Paimon: That sounds like something Paimon could do! But, would that really change anything?
Iansan: Consistency is key! You can't accomplish your goals in one fell swoop. You have to eat away at them little by little.
Iansan: My Ancient Name means "power," did you know that? So, everyone thought I would grow up to be this tall, burly, muscular warrior.
Iansan: But, that's not what happened. A lot of people were confused and disappointed. My fellow warriors couldn't understand why I inherited that name over them.
Iansan: At first, I also felt lost. It was only later that I realized true strength basically boils down to problem-solving. Physical strength is just a means to an end like everything else.
Iansan: So, I began to break problems down into smaller parts. When facing an impossible situation, you just need to act. And if you fail, so what? That's just life.
Iansan: Anyway, that's what I've learned over the years. Maybe it'll come in handy for you some day.
Traveler: Well said.
Paimon: When you put it that way, Paimon's almost encouraged to start drinking kale juice tomorrow... No, today! Paimon will start today!
Paimon: You're amazing, Iansan! You really make Paimon feel like she can do the impossible! Maybe your true strength is giving other people strength...
Iansan: I don't deserve that much credit!
Iansan: You already have that strength within you. I'm sure you've faced more obstacles than I can imagine during your travels. But, you never gave up! That proves it!
Iansan: I bet I could learn a thing or two from you.
Utsil: Iansan! Bad news! Ocotlan is out of control!
Iansan: Stay calm! I'll be right there!
Iansan: Looks like the time for conversation is over. C'mon, let's go see him.
Traveler: Thank you for the advice.
Traveler: I'd probably feel the same way...
Traveler: You got them through the initial stage of panic.

### Additional Talk 8

Utsil: What are you doing, Ocotlan? Wake up!
Munay: Don't you recognize us, my boy?
Duarte (Monster's Roar): ■■■
Ocotlan: ...
Ocotlan: (The Abyss monsters are everywhere... everywhere...)
Duarte (Monster's Roar): ■■■■■■
Ocotlan: (They've taken over the tribe. No corner is safe...)
Ocotlan: (Did we lose the battle? No... It's pointless to think about that now. A warrior only has one job — fight until the very end.)
Utsil: Careful! He's not himself!
Munay: Ocotlan!
Iansan: Get back!
Iansan: I don't think he can hear us right now.
Iansan: We need to get him under control. Let's go!

### Additional Talk 9

Munay: Please, son. You've got to stop... You can't keep going like this.
Ocotlan: Wretched... monsters...
Ocotlan: Give me my family back!
Utsil: Look, Ocotlan! That's your father! He's standing right in front of you!
Ocotlan: Get out of my home! I'll never forgive you!
Iansan: Watch out!
Paimon: Are you alright, sir?
Munay: *coughing*... I'm fine.
Munay: Please, don't hurt my son. He's... Just trying to protect his home...
Iansan: Don't worry. We'll figure something out.
Traveler: Got him.
Paimon: Phew... But, what should we do now? He's different from the other two. It's like he can't hear us at all.
Paimon: He keeps calling us monsters... We're basically enemies to him now.
Traveler: And he sure knows how to fight.
Munay: Ocotlan...
Iansan: He has a fighting spirit, that's for sure. But, we can't keep him unconscious forever. I need to think...
"The Captain" (???): ...Abyssal Corrosion Syndrome.
"The Captain" (???): ...Five hundred years later, and it's resurfaced again.
Paimon: Huh? That voice, it's—
Traveler: The Captain!?
Iansan: So, you've seen this illness before?
"The Captain": Direct contact with high concentrations of Abyssal power causes irreversible mental trauma in most people.
"The Captain": The exact presentation will vary according to trauma level. Some will suffer from superficial hallucinations and maintain the capacity to perceive the outside world. In such cases, verbal and physical interaction can be used to break through the hallucination.
"The Captain": However, there are also those who are so far gone, entrenched in hallucinations so deep, that medical intervention is the only option. That's why we developed the Draught of Lucidity.
Paimon: The Draught of... Lucidity?
"The Captain": It's a kind of medicine that can dispel the psychological impact of the Abyss. The treatment comes with severe side-effects, including chronic migraines for the rest of the patient's life, so it's reserved for the worst cases.
"The Captain": This man is a devoted warrior, one not easily swayed from battle. That is precisely why it's so difficult to pull him out of this hallucination.
"The Captain": If you trust me to be true to my word, give him this.
Ocotlan: Wretched monsters... Setting up an ambush...
Ocotlan: Give me your worst! It's either your end or mine!
Utsil: Hurry! He's awake!
Munay: Please, give him the draught. My son thinks he's alone in this world.
Munay: In his mind, all his family and comrades are gone, and only enemies remain... There's nothing more painful for a warrior than losing everything you've fought so hard to protect.
Black Screen Text: At the father's request, Iansan accepts the draught from The Captain and quickly gives it to Ocotlan.
Ocotlan: Monsters... Ugh...
Ocotlan: What's going on? I... Dad? What are you doing here?
Ocotlan: My head hurts... I just had the strangest dream. I dreamt the Abyss took over the tribe...
Munay: It's alright, my boy... It was just a nightmare.
Munay: Let's go home. You need a good night's sleep. Ah, but first — I want to thank you for saving my son. May I ask your name?
"The Captain": Th... *ahem* Just "Capitano" is fine.
Munay: I owe you more than words can say, Mr. Capitano. My name is Munay. You're welcome in my home any time.
Munay: Time to go, son. Can you stand?
Ocotlan: ...
Iansan: #I'll help you carry him back. Traveler, let's meet up later.

### Additional Talk 10

Black Screen Text: After the crowd disperses, The Captain hands a few more doses of medicine to the guards, so that the remaining warriors can be cured.
Paimon: Thank goodness everything turned out alright.
Traveler: Thank you.
"The Captain": Think nothing of it. I agreed to offer you my aid, so this is merely a part of that duty.
"The Captain": Besides... I care deeply about this land.
Paimon: Right! When we were with Mavuika, you told us you and your soldiers defended Natlan against the Abyss five hundred years ago.
"The Captain": That's right. My desire to protect this nation remains unchanged.
"The Captain": When my platoon arrived in Natlan five hundred years ago, like you, we were true outlanders. But, as time passed, I encountered the people of this land and witnessed their desperate struggle against the Abyss.
"The Captain": Though many of the warriors were rash and inexperienced, they were steadfast and fearless in battle, willing to do anything to protect their fellow citizens... oftentimes with complete disregard for their own survival.
"The Captain": Just as I fought for the glory of Khaenri'ah, they fought for the survival of their nation. We happened to share a common enemy, so I decided to offer my aid.
"The Captain": We fought side by side to the very end. I traveled to many places after that, but I never forgot this land. Even now... My work in Natlan remains unfinished.
Traveler: Natlan hasn't forgotten you, either.
"The Captain": They remember who I used to be — the "Sentinel Knight" who fought with the Masters of the Night-Wind. Still, I prefer to leave all that in the past.
"The Captain": That name carries with it the glory of my homeland and the honor of Natlan. Yet, I failed to bring my soldiers home, and I failed to help Natlan defeat the Abyss.
Paimon: But, that's not your fault! The Abyss is way stronger than any of us imagined...
"The Captain": You need not comfort me. I am no longer who I once was... Let the events of the past continue to collect dust in the annals of history. I will continue to help Natlan in my own way.
Paimon: Like with the Draught of Lucidity?
Paimon: Who knew you could make medicine! Were you a doctor before?
"The Captain": The draught was Guthred's invention. He was a respected military doctor as well as my trusted second-in-command.
"The Captain": We faced a similar situation to what you witnessed today. The endless battles against the Abyss triggered delusions among the soldiers, to the point where some attempted to kill each other.
"The Captain": In order to develop a treatment as fast as possible, Guthred used himself as a test subject. He passed away shortly after the draught was complete.
"The Captain": That's who he was — unrelenting in his pursuits, no matter the cost, no matter the sacrifice... in the end, he even gave himself up for a chance at success.
"The Captain": I'm sure he would be pleased his creation aids people even now... The Abyss has wrought enough suffering on this land. I sincerely hope this war will end soon.
Traveler: (No matter the cost, no matter the sacrifice... Huh, that sounds rather familiar.)
Guthred (???): Stop worrying about other people's survival, about their losses and sacrifices. You just need to win! That must be why I've returned... for this moment.
Guthred (???): Please finish what you've set out to do, Commander.
Traveler: The soul that possessed Ororon...
"The Captain": Hm... You're more perceptive than I imagined.
"The Captain": However, some things are better kept secret for now. We may be working together, but our goals are not entirely aligned.
Paimon: What's with the secrets all of a sudden? Paimon's starting to think we should be more careful around you!
"The Captain": I do not mean to jeopardize the trust between us. I simply prefer to keep this to myself because it's a personal matter.
"The Captain": All I can tell you is this — Natlan may have survived the worst of the crisis, but the souls of this land are still not at peace.
"The Captain": ...And that is why my work is not yet done.
Paimon: Well, if it's personal, then we'll just have to trust you.
"The Captain": If you have other questions, I'm willing to answer them.
Paimon: Wait, like anything?
Paimon: #Paimon wants to know how you eat with the mask... Anything you want to ask, Traveler?
Traveler: (Actually... There is something I want to know.)
Citlali: Natlan must pay the price for Mavuika's use of the Ruler of Death's power. That price is death, and only Mavuika's death can clear the debt.
Citlali: Even now that the war's over and the threat to Natlan is gone, it looks like that death is still set in stone.
Traveler: (Could The Captain know something about the Ruler of Death? I might not get this opportunity again. I should ask him.)
Traveler: (Ask about the Ruler of Death.)
"The Captain": In the garden cultivated by the gods, flowers and weeds grow side by side. When the weeds compete for nutrients in the soil, the gardener intervenes to inhibit their growth.
"The Captain": I'm not one to pass judgment based on my own standard of right and wrong. But, it is an undeniable fact that she is responsible for my suffering, as well as that of my people.
"The Captain": If that explanation is too difficult to understand, allow me to show you exactly what I mean.
Paimon: Ah...!
Traveler: The curse of immortality...
"The Captain": The Ruler of Death can freely define the form of death, or grant immortality to anyone she desires.
"The Captain": Her power is a rule in and of itself. Faced with such an overwhelming level of power, it can feel hopeless to resist.
"The Captain": But, I am of the belief that, in this world, no destiny is unchangeable, no death inevitable, and no rule unbreakable.
"The Captain": ...So, before the final moment truly arrives, we must fight harder than ever.
Iansan: #Hey, Traveler! Paimon!
Iansan: Sorry, hope I didn't interrupt anything.
Iansan: After helping Ocotlan back home, I went on a small walk, and happened to run into a messenger from the Scions of the Canopy. He's been looking for you everywhere.
Paimon: Oh, did something happen?
Iansan: Apparently, Xilonen's ready to start forging your Ancient Name. She needs to check the progress of your Pilgrim's Chronicle... that device she gave you before.
Iansan: She invited a bunch of people to be there, including me. So, let's head to the Stadium once you're done here.
"The Captain": #This is a critical time for you, Traveler. It's best not to delay, so let us end our conversation for now.
"The Captain": Best of luck to you all. Goodbye.
Iansan: What a mysterious guy... Still, he doesn't seem quite as intimidating as before. We're basically comrades now, right?
Iansan: Anyway, let's head to the Stadium. We shouldn't keep everyone waiting.
Traveler: I don't know what I expected, but this is...
Traveler: It was Guthred, wasn't it?
Traveler: Why don't you want to use your name from five hundred years ago?
"The Captain": ...
"The Captain": It may seem difficult to understand, but the reason is really quite simple.
Traveler: You saved the day.

Ajaw: Sure took your sweet time...
Ajaw: Wretched scoundrels! How dare you keep the Almighty Dragonlord K'uhul Ajaw waiting! Kneel before us and apologize, or we'll—
Kinich: Don't listen to him. We just got here, too.
Paimon: Kinich, Kachina, Mualani! Whoa... everyone's here!
Mualani: Reunited at last! Did you miss us?
Kachina: I brought candy and cookies to share!
Paimon: Of course we missed you! Ooh... you brought Saurus Crackers, too? Score!
Citlali: #Just in time, Traveler. It's so stifling in here, I was just about to go outside to get some air.
Ororon: It's the same temperature outside... Anyway, how was the trip here?
Traveler: Pretty smooth.
Xilonen: To be honest, I also didn't expect this many people to show up.
Xilonen: A third of this amount is more than enough for my plan.
Traveler: Why do you need them here?
Xilonen: I need to ask them about you, gather their thoughts and hopes. That will help the formation of your Ancient Name.
Xilonen: You brought the Pilgrim's Chronicle, right? Yeah, let me take a look.
Xilonen: Hm... Okay, the progress looks good. We have enough people, so let's get started.
Chasca: Sorry I'm late.
Mualani: Chasca showing up late for something? That's a first!
Chasca: I had to follow a group of monsters further than expected.
Chasca: When I got back, I heard about what you did for my tribe. Thank you.
Iansan: #Haha, Traveler deserves most of the credit.
Iansan: Plus, if it weren't for your help during the battle, the Collective of Plenty would have suffered a lot more. We had the manpower to spare, so it's only right we return the favor.
Traveler: We were just doing our part.
Xilonen: *ahem* Okay, let's save the pleasantries for later. Everyone's here, so let's get started.
Xilonen: #Alright, let me remind everyone what's going to happen. I need each of you to stand before the Pilgrim's Chronicle and share your stories about Traveler.
Xilonen: #Your words will be recorded and become part of Traveler's Ancient Name. Any questions?
Kachina: Nope!
Xilonen: Alright, then to start things off...
Citlali: Hold on! Remember what we discussed?
Xilonen: Ah, right. I almost forgot.
Xilonen: #Traveler, Paimon, you can't be here for this part.
Paimon: Huh? But, why? We wanna hear what everyone has to say!
Xilonen: I need people's true thoughts and feelings. It's best if the subject in question isn't involved.
Xilonen: It's much more difficult to express those feelings to someone's face. People get shy in those situations, it's just how it is.
Paimon: #You're right... Just like when Paimon doesn't have enough Mora to pay for her meal, but she's too embarrassed to tell Traveler, so she has to make up some excuse...
Traveler: Paimon... I don't think that's the same.
Paimon: *ahem* So, basically, you want us to leave the Pilgrim's Chronicle here, and wait nearby?
Xilonen: Don't worry. This shouldn't take long.
Paimon: Everything Xilonen said made sense, but did you see Citlali's reaction back there? She was definitely the one who decided we should leave.
Paimon: Hmm... But staying out here is just making Paimon even more curious about what everyone's gonna say!
Paimon: Anyway, you're gonna have an Ancient Name soon! Ooh, that's so exciting! Feels like we've been in Natlan for quite a while already, doesn't it?
Traveler: We've been traveling together for even longer.
Paimon: You're right! If only Paimon could say a few things about you in there...
Xilonen: Well, looks like you're about to have that chance.
Paimon: Xilonen? Is everything all set?
Xilonen: #Almost... We're just missing one last thing. You've been by Traveler's side the longest, Paimon. We need to hear what you have to say.
Paimon: But, Paimon's not from Natlan...
Xilonen: #It doesn't matter. As Traveler's companion, your contributions are extremely important. You're the perfect person to finish the story.
Xilonen: #Sorry, Traveler. I just need to borrow Paimon for a second. It should be quick.
Black Screen Text: Despite Xilonen's assurance, quite a lot of time seems to pass.
Xilonen: Phew...
Traveler: That took longer than expected.
Xilonen: Paimon gave us a lot, and I mean a lot, of information... I'm not even sure the Lord of the Night managed to get all of it.
Paimon: W—Well, we've been to six nations already!
Xilonen: Here, you can have the Pilgrim's Chronicle back. I'll need it when I forge the name, but you can continue your adventures in the meantime.
Xilonen: When the time comes... I will forge you an Ancient Name unlike anything that's come before, so that you, Mavuika, and Natlan as a whole can finally put an end to this endless war.
Traveler: Did something go wrong?
Traveler: We're glad everything worked out.
Traveler: Pretty sweaty.

Xilonen: I'll need the Pilgrim's Chronicle back when I'm ready to forge the name. If there are still adventures you want to record, better finish them before then.
