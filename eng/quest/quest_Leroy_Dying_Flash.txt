## Talk 2

Benoit Leroy: Athos's shirt, 1,000 Mora... Morticia's necklace... Tsk, tsk. Youngsters these days sure know how to spend.
Traveler: Hello there, Mr. Leroy.
Paimon: Hey there! Euphrasie sent us.
Black Screen Text: You explain to Mr. Leroy why you're here.
Benoit Leroy: Haha, that was half a year ago, wasn't it? I didn't think Euphrasie would hold on to that commission for so long.
Benoit Leroy: It's true — I did think of hiring hourly workers. After all, even the most capable of us get old and need others to take care of them.
Benoit Leroy: I spent so much of my life working to have this home, but in my old age, I found that I had no one to share it with.
Benoit Leroy: That did make me quite sad for a time — so it's a good thing, all in all, that my daughter and son-in-law have come to take care of me.
Benoit Leroy: They're good children, they love each other very much, and they keep me company. There's nothing more that I could want.
Benoit Leroy: That's to say, youngster, that I'm not hiring anymore.
Traveler: So we came here for nothing...?
Benoit Leroy: Well, now, don't be too down. That's not how young'uns should be. You lot should be enjoying your best life, armed with a smile!
Benoit Leroy: Also, since you made the trip here, and since Euphrasie recommended you, I do, in fact, have some work for you.
Benoit Leroy: It just so happens that the kids are out, and I can't quite handle everything here. Of course, you will be paid.
Paimon: Ooh, nice! You're a great guy, Mr. Leroy!
Benoit Leroy: Hahaha, and you've got quite the silver tongue!
Benoit Leroy: Alright, then, go help me clean the stains by the door and behind the house — and feed Nana some fish while you're at it.
Benoit Leroy: Right, I forgot to mention, but Nana's my cat — you know, the one by the door. Thanks in advance on Nana's behalf.
Paimon: Well, that sounds simple enough. No problem! Leave it to us.
Traveler: Really, that Euphrasie...

## Talk 3

Benoit Leroy: Newspaper delivery? Just leave it by the door, thanks. I'll come get it later.
Knock: (You've already helped Benoit out today. It would be rude to disturb his rest. You agreed to meet him tomorrow, so it'd be best to just do that.)

## Talk 4

Benoit Leroy: Did you forget what I'd asked you to do? ...Ah, children and their memories.
Benoit Leroy: The first thing I asked you to help with is to clean near the entrance and the back of the house. The next is to feed a bit of fish to Nana, my cat.

## Talk 5

Benoit Leroy: You're done?
Paimon: That's right, Mr. Leroy. Also...
Benoit Leroy: Hmm? What is it? Want some candy? Or would you like your pocket money now?
Paimon: B—Both, hehehe...
Traveler: Paimon...
Benoit Leroy: Haha, what a greedy little child. Still, that's fine — that's exactly what little children should be like.
Benoit Leroy: Especially little ladies as cute as you, Paimon. Macarons, pretty dresses, and lovely homes — that's what you deserve to have.
Paimon: #Hehe, Paimon reckons so too! Hey, {NICKNAME}, could we get...
Traveler: Nope.
Paimon: Boo! Boo! You're so stingy!
Traveler: We're adventurers, Paimon...
Paimon: Paimon doesn't see how any of that stuff conflicts with having macarons, skirts, or big beautiful houses, though...
Benoit Leroy: Heh, what's with the sudden argument? Tsk, kids. But a little banter now and then is good. That just shows that you're still children.
Traveler: Actually, about that, I'm...
Benoit Leroy: Treasure your childhood. It won't last.
Benoit Leroy: ...Anyway, here — candies and coins both. Now then, do behave, alright?
Paimon: Yay, snacks! Thank you, Mr. Leroy!
Benoit Leroy: Just call me Benoit, child. Leroy is my surname.
Benoit Leroy: I am the last Leroy in the entire Court of Fontaine — mentions of my family name make this poor old soul quite lonely indeed, so please, just use my name.
Paimon: Mr. Le... Er, Benoit, so... Your daughter doesn't share your surname?
Benoit Leroy: Morticia isn't my daughter by blood. I took her in half a year ago. That said, she may as well be my own trueborn daughter.
Benoit Leroy: If you don't mind, you can come again tomorrow — she and Athos should be back by then.
Benoit Leroy: I'm sure she won't mind having two lovely children like you over for snacks, especially since you're helping us with some of the chores.
Benoit Leroy: Some other children come by occasionally, so feel free to play with them, too. I love children — the more of them are around, the merrier the house is.
Benoit Leroy: If you don't see me when you come over again, just knock and ask for me — Athos will open the door for you.
Paimon: Alrighty! We'll be back tomorrow, then!
Benoit Leroy: Good, good, I should be going back inside, at any rate.
Traveler: See you tomorrow.
Benoit Leroy: See you then, children.
Traveler: That's how you know we get along.
Traveler: Don't lose sight of why we're traveling, Paimon...
