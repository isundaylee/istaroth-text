# The Currents of Life


## Talk 1

Paimon: We've been waiting quite a while, but the shrine maiden still hasn't shown up.
Paimon: Looks like we'll just have to start the third round without her. Who will we team up with this time?

## Talk 2

Shikanoin Heizou: Let's search along the cliffside. If I'm not mistaken, there should be a chunk of earth that's unlike the others...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Looks like the festival has started! Let's go check it out!

## Talk 4

Traveler: (There are some footprints visible on the ground.)
Traveler: (However, upon closer inspection, they seem to belong to Heizou and myself. Huh, could that woman really be a ghost...?)

## Talk 5

Shikanoin Heizou: Have you found any leads yet?
Traveler: I noticed some branches that seemed a little unusual.
Paimon: Yeah, some tree branches seem like they were bent by something, but that's about it.
Shikanoin Heizou: I see. After you left, I took a good look around the area.
Shikanoin Heizou: Aside from the bent branches, there are burn marks in some places, but that doesn't really tell us much.
Shikanoin Heizou: If only there was some more conclusive evidence...
Hitotsume Kozou: Excuse me, uh... sorry to interrupt.
Paimon: Oh, it's you guys! What are you all doing here?
Youko: We heard you were out searching for clues, and we wanted to help.
Paimon: Oh, that's really brave of you!
Kappa: Uh, actually, we're also really unsure about what's happening here...
Kappa: We just asked the members of Mr. Itto's gang about what happened to them, and it sounded really scary.
Kappa: That lady is either a nasty evil spirit or a formidable youkai... Either way, it's not good.
Kappa: Bâ€”But we still want to hold the Mikawa Flower Festival.
Hitotsume Kozou: Uh-huh!
Youko: We long admired the friendship between Lord Kamai and the Samurai.
Youko: Which is why we want to hold the Mikawa Flower Festival, to return the favor we once received from the humans.
Youko: Even though our powers are limited, we don't want this bond of friendship to vanish. The Mikawa Flower Festival is meant to be enjoyable for everyone.
Shikanoin Heizou: The Chinju Forest covers a large area, so it'd be great to have more help in the investigation.
Shikanoin Heizou: Welcome to the team. Let's all do our best to figure out what's going on.
Hitotsume Kozou: Don't worry, we're very familiar with the area. We won't miss any clues!

## Talk 6

Kappa: *panting* ...
Kappa: Look what I found down by the river...
Hitotsume Kozou: Oh? What is it?
Youko: Is it a scrap of black cloth? I've never seen fabric like this before.
Shikanoin Heizou: Ah, this is a piece of shade cloth.
Paimon: Shade cloth?
Shikanoin Heizou: Yeah. It can effectively block out light and is used in a variety of settings, including stage performances.
Shikanoin Heizou: There is a rough tear in the cloth, probably caused by a sharp stone or maybe some branches...
Paimon: Branches...?
Shikanoin Heizou: Suppose that a large shade cloth was originally hung from a tree, bending the branches.
Shikanoin Heizou: When the shade cloth was removed from the tree, perhaps one of the corners caught and the branches ripped it, causing a small piece of black cloth to fall into the river.
Shikanoin Heizou: Either she didn't care, or she was in too great a hurry. Perhaps she had other things to handle at the time.
Paimon: But why would she hang shade cloth in the trees?
Shikanoin Heizou: I'm only speculating, but...
Shikanoin Heizou: Maybe she used it to "create" the atmosphere you experienced.
Traveler: What do you mean?
Shikanoin Heizou: Let's not worry about that for now. There are still many variables I haven't deduced yet.
Shikanoin Heizou: Next, I'd like to investigate the place where the Arataki Gang encountered her. Do you know how to get there?
Hitotsume Kozou: Oh, I know the way.
Hitotsume Kozou: I asked the gang members where their encounter with the ghost happened when we were chatting earlier. I'll take you there!
Shikanoin Heizou: Good, please lead the way.
Shikanoin Heizou: Let's go find out what's going on.

## Talk 7

Hitotsume Kozou: This is the place!
Hitotsume Kozou: They claimed that as they passed through here, the area suddenly grew dark and some ghostly flames appeared out of nowhere...
Paimon: Huh, what a coincidence...
Paimon: We saw the very same thing.
Shikanoin Heizou: Let's start by taking a look around the area, just as we did before.

## Talk 8

Kappa: There's some strange powder in the cracks of these stones...
Kappa: I picked some up and sniffed it to see what it is, and it made me really dizzy... ugh, I'm so tired now...

## Talk 9

Hitotsume Kozou: I found some sort of smashed ball under the tree.
Hitotsume Kozou: The inside of it looks like it was blackened by smoke and it smells like fireworks.

## Talk 10

Youko: Judging from the burn marks left on the scene, the ghostly flames you saw were not created by youkai power.
Youko: Rather, they appear to have been caused by something flammable. I'm not sure what though...

## Talk 11

Shikanoin Heizou: Hmm, similar scare tactics... and she didn't have the time to completely hide the traces...
Shikanoin Heizou: I believe we're closing in on the truth now.
Shikanoin Heizou: I'm almost certain that the woman you encountered was not a ghost.
Shikanoin Heizou: She possesses no extraordinary powers. She was merely scaring people with some small props she had set up ahead of time.
Paimon: Some small props? But can you really do all that with just some props? What we saw was absolutely terrifying.
Shikanoin Heizou: First and foremost, the Test of Courage contributed to the unsettling atmosphere here.
Shikanoin Heizou: You were initially frightened by your first encounter with these three youkai, and then shortly after, you ran into the mysterious woman. It was natural for you to be on edge.
Shikanoin Heizou: Because you were already tensed up, you were breathing more rapidly and inhaled a lot of sleeping powder that she had sprinkled around the area. That is what caused you to feel dizzy.
Shikanoin Heizou: That's when she pulled down the shade cloth and lit those so-called "ghostly flames," creating a terrifying scene... Hmm, that's the most likely explanation, anyway.
Youko: So it was all just a show?
Paimon: Ugh, she tricked us!
Shikanoin Heizou: There is, however, still one loose end. The person who commissioned my investigation did become stranded on the beach as a result of some unusual power.
Shikanoin Heizou: That couldn't have been accomplished by just a few small props... But if she possesses such powers, why bother with the theatrics?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon can't wrap her head around all this.
Shikanoin Heizou: ...
Shikanoin Heizou: She can only use props to scare people in the forest, but she can use strange powers on the beach... I see. I think I've figured it out.
Paimon: Woah, that was fast!
Shikanoin Heizou: If we rule out the potential of organized crime, then only one possibility remains.
Shikanoin Heizou: I know who the woman is. Let's go to the beach.
Youko: We'll come along, too!
Shikanoin Heizou: No, you should go back and tell the others not to be afraid and not waste their time searching the forest.
Shikanoin Heizou: The truth has surfaced. It's time to put an end to all the unnecessary panic and await the outcome of the Test of Courage.
Hitotsume Kozou: Okay, but please be careful.
Hitotsume Kozou: If you run into any danger, simply call out our names. We'll be able to hear you.
Shikanoin Heizou: There shouldn't be any danger now, but thank you anyway. Let's go.

## Talk 12

Hanyuuda Chizuru (???): I knew it... I knew that you would come find me here.
Paimon: There she is!
Paimon: Paimon thought you were a youkai like the others, but they said they'd never seen you before.
Paimon: So who are you? And why did you try to scare us?
Hanyuuda Chizuru (???): ...
Hanyuuda Chizuru (???): I've already warned you never to speak to me. If you don't leave now, then...
Paimon: Eek! She's terrifying! Heizou, it sure doesn't seem like she's using any props this time!
Shikanoin Heizou: Don't move! Just trust me.
Shikanoin Heizou: Your youkai power won't scare us. It will only hasten your demise.
Paimon: Youkai power?
Hanyuuda Chizuru (???): Huh, how did you know?
Shikanoin Heizou: You're a youkai that emerged from an object and assumed a human form outside of your own body...
Shikanoin Heizou: When this type of youkai is close to its own body, it can use some youkai power, but that ability weakens as it moves further away.
Shikanoin Heizou: And if the original body is destroyed, then the youkai that originated from it will likewise perish.
Shikanoin Heizou: Should I refer to you as a "Hagoita Spirit" or "Tsukumogami"?
Hanyuuda Chizuru: ...Don't bother. You may call me Hanyuuda Chizuru, that is the name I go by now.
Paimon: Chizuru... why do you want us to leave?
Paimon: If you're a youkai, you should understand why the other youkai want to interact with humans...
Paimon: Besides, we had a great time playing Akitsu Yuugei together, didn't we? Just like the story of Kamai and the samurai...
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Yes... that's why...
Hanyuuda Chizuru: That's why I don't want you to be sad too...
Paimon: Sad? What do you mean?
Hanyuuda Chizuru: I'm sure the youkai have already told you of the story about Kamai befriending the samurai.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: But they don't actually know the entire story.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Their friendship started as something they looked forward to, and in just a few decades, it turned into regret.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Lord Kamai's appearance hadn't changed, but his dear friend in front of him had grown old. The joys of friendship gradually gave way to the pain of regret.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: People often say that those outside the situation can see things more clearly, and I learned a harsh truth after witnessing all of it. Everything that people come to regret is inevitably set in motion from the beginning...
Hanyuuda Chizuru: We youkai are different from humans, we have longer lifespans and different natures... But we share the same world, we interact with one another, we are drawn to one another, and will eventually part ways.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: When the dream ends, all that is left are sorrowful memories and lingering pain...
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Even a wise and seasoned youkai like Kamai felt sadness when it was time to say goodbye. Imagine what a pure and kind little youkai would feel.
Shikanoin Heizou: ...
Paimon: So, you mean...
Hanyuuda Chizuru: I was hiding on this beach, waiting for the last of my days.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: But those three youkai came and set up the Akitsu Yuugei here, which woke me from my slumber.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: I didn't want them to approach humans with unbridled optimism and enthusiasm just because they'd heard the legend of Kamai and the samurai. That would simply be repeating the same mistake...
Paimon: Is that why you pretended to be a ghost? To scare all the people away from here?
Paimon: Oh... so you must be the one who trapped that guy on the beach? That was a little bit harsh, don't you think?
Hanyuuda Chizuru: My power has become pretty weak now, and most of the time I just use some props I've collected to scare people. I can't show myself when there are a lot of people around.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: But that jerk was greedy. He wanted to steal the decorations from Akitsu Yuugei and sell them for a profit.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: That's why I used my youkai power to teach him a lesson.
Paimon: Ah, so that's what happened. You have a strong sense of justice.
Paimon: By the way, how did you know the rest of the story about Kamai and the samurai?
Hanyuuda Chizuru: ...
Shikanoin Heizou: It's okay if you don't want to tell us. I've already figured it out.
Shikanoin Heizou: Your true form is this pair of hagoita, isn't it?
Paimon: Hagoita? Ah, wait, so that means she's...
Shikanoin Heizou: The pair of hagoita used by Kamai and the human samurai to play Akitsu Haz{RUBY#[S]Haneasobi}ura hundreds of years ago.
Shikanoin Heizou: You gradually developed sentience after being influenced by great youkai power. You were the closest to witness their story.
Shikanoin Heizou: Even with the youkai power's blessing, the hagoita have started to rot away after hundreds of years. You can't sustain yourself, so you were forced to rely on props to scare people.
Shikanoin Heizou: And, if my theory is correct, this pair of hagoita is also the item we need to find for the third round of the Test of Courage...
Yae Miko: Excellent work. You've figured it all out.
Yae Miko: Congratulations, little ones. You've passed the third round of the Test of Courage.
Paimon: Miko! And... the shrine maiden? Paimon thought you went missing.
Shrine Maiden: I apologize for causing you concern. It was actually Lady Yae's idea...
Yae Miko: Haha, well? What did you think? Were you scared?
Yae Miko: Because fear is induced by uncertainty, the more chaotic the situation, the better. Having the event staff also mysteriously vanish only added to the uncertainty... I must say, I think this Test of Courage truly lived up to its name.
Paimon: So you're the one responsible for all the scary stuff!
Yae Miko: Hitomi, go tell the others that the Test of Courage has ended and that we have a winner.
Shikanoin Heizou: Now that I've solved the mystery, I'm going back to meet with my client. The "intent to steal" is not exactly a serious crime, but it can't go unpunished.
Shikanoin Heizou: I'll see you two later.
Paimon: Miko, did you choose the hagoita for the third round of the Test of Courage because you already knew about Chizuru?
Hanyuuda Chizuru: "Miko"... "Lady Yae"... You're...
Yae Miko: I followed Kitsune Saiguu around the Mikawa Flower Festival one year and saw her play Akitsu Haz{RUBY#[S]Haneasobi}ura.
Yae Miko: That was when I saw you. You didn't have a human form at the time, and possessed only the earliest traces of sentience.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: I remember now, you were on Kitsune Saiguu's shoulder...
Yae Miko: I went for a stroll on the beach some time ago and sensed a familiar youkai power.
Yae Miko: Though your power was weak, I was still able to find you. You were sitting in a tree, gazing at the tourists below.
Yae Miko: I overheard you telling yourself that you must be patient and avoid contact with humans.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Huh, when was that? I didn't notice you at all.
Yae Miko: With your powers being so diminished, it was only natural that you didn't notice me.
Yae Miko: You must have been blaming yourself all this time. You knew Kamai and the samurai became friends as a result of Akitsu Haz{RUBY#[S]Haneasobi}ura, a game connected to your existence.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: At the time, I couldn't take on a human form like this. I had only a hazy sense of the outer world.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: After they first met at the Mikawa Flower Festival, I felt proud to know that I had left a mark on their story.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: But after they said their final goodbyes, I could often hear Kamai sighing to himself. I couldn't help but hide, because I blamed myself. When I woke up again, the world had changed.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Lady Yae, you are a well-known youkai. You must know many more things than I do... so, I have a question for you...
Hanyuuda Chizuru: People meet, become friends, and then go their separate ways. After such a short time, they leave only regret and sadness in their wake.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Is it really worthwhile for us youkai to interact with humans?
Yae Miko: #Why not? Tell me, how did you feel when you played Akitsu Yuugei with Traveler?
Hanyuuda Chizuru: I felt happy, but...
Yae Miko: But your "rationality" told you that it was wrong, didn't it?
Yae Miko: It turns out that there is still another piece to the story of Kamai and the samurai that you are missing.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: What do you mean? The samurai and Kamai never met again.
Yae Miko: True, but the story doesn't end there. That samurai's name was Yanagibashi Takuto, who also happens to be the founder of the Souran Isshin Art.
Yae Miko: "It is believed that Takuto developed this style of swordsmanship while dueling with Kamai, who had also befriended the third-generation heir of the Souran Isshin Art, Tominaga Masanari."
Yae Miko: Five hundred years ago, Kamai and Tominaga fought side by side until their final moments, and the sword Tominaga wielded was passed down from Yanagibashi. The regret Kamai once felt had finally been resolved.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Oh... I never knew...
Yae Miko: We youkai are not like humans. Humans have too short a lifespan, and the day will inevitably come we when must say goodbye.
Yae Miko: However, the bond formed by friendship will not be broken, but rather, carried on in a new form.
Yae Miko: There's no reason to be upset by this. Time flies by in an instant, and life passes by like a dream. So, you must be happy in the present. You should understand what I mean now.
Arataki Itto: Hey, compadres!
Paimon: Itto! What are you doing here?
Arataki Itto: Haha, Hitomi told me everything... and I also heard that you won the last round!
Arataki Itto: I even know who the ghost lady is now. Anyway, I had a little discussion with the others and uhh...
Arataki Itto: Hey, you're that fox lady! Why are you here?
Yae Miko: Hehe, please just disregard my presence. Now, tell us what you discussed.
Arataki Itto: Ah right, ahem! Alright, listen up! To celebrate the end of the Test of Courage event, we will be holding the Mikawa Flower Festival.
Arataki Itto: I gave it some real thought, and realized that it might be kinda difficult for those little youkai to hold the festival on their own. But with my help, it won't be a problem!
Arataki Itto: That's right, Arataki "The One and Oni" Itto, will be in charge of organizing the best Mikawa Flower Festival anyone's ever seen!
Hitotsume Kozou (Youko & Kappa & Hitotsume Kozou): Hurray for Itto!
Yae Miko: Oh!
Paimon: Uh, can we really trust this guy with a festival?
Arataki Itto: Hey, whatcha tryin' to say? Besides, it won't just be me! Other people will help too. Even my bro Ayato is gonna be there!
Arataki Itto: Everyone's busy getting ready, and the festival will be up and running in no time. It won't be long until you can all join the fun! Hahaha!
Hitotsume Kozou (Youko & Kappa & Hitotsume Kozou): You're the best, Itto!
Yae Miko: And what would a festival be without me? I'll be sure to go have a look, too.
Yae Miko: Ah, it has been some time since I've attended a festival... Fortunately, I brought sake with me.
Paimon: Paimon's gotta admit, Itto does have his moments!
Paimon: A festival, delicious food... Count Paimon in!
Traveler: Do you want to join us, Chizuru?
Hanyuuda Chizuru: ...
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Alright, I'll join... If you don't mind, that is...
Black Screen Text: Itto sets up the festival with the youkai and others...

## Talk 13

Kamisato Ayato: So, did you enjoy the Test of Courage?
Kamisato Ayato: Once I learned of the youkai's intentions to hold a festival, I wanted to spread the word and attract people to their event.
Kamisato Ayato: However, it occurred to me that doing so might be overly ambitious. If we marketed the Mikawa Flower Festival from the get-go, people would have arrived with insatiably high expectations.
Kamisato Ayato: So I decided on using the Test of Courage's notoriety to attract visitors and left the rest to the youkai.
Kamisato Ayato: I had an inkling that their presence would spice up the event, hehe...

## Talk 14

Hanyuuda Chizuru: Alright, here will do. Thank you for agreeing to come with me.
Traveler: Don't mention it.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Actually, I was delighted when I first discovered that I could take on a human form.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: I was a youkai derived from a pair of hagoita who came into being in the middle of a festival, so naturally I enjoyed the lively festival atmosphere.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: I wanted to go to more festivals, become friends with humans, and play Akitsu Yuugei with them.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: But every evening as night began to set in, I'd recall the bitter smile of the old samurai as he set down the hagoita, and the lonely Kamai sighing as he drank his sake.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Then I would wonder... if I became friends with a human, would that person experience the same melancholy in the future?
Hanyuuda Chizuru: As a result, I was convinced that I couldn't do it. I told myself that I would not repeat that same mistake.
Traveler: I understand what you mean.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: I'm sorry that I spoke so strangely when we first met... I'm sure it must have scared you.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: I expected you to flee in terror, but when we met again, you acted like you had no trouble being around me.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: I knew you mistook me as one of the youkai, but instead of telling you the truth, I went and played Akitsu Yuugei with you...
Traveler: Why?
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Hmm... I'm not completely sure myself.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Perhaps it's because I've always wanted to be like Kamai and play Akitsu Yuugei with humans.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Or perhaps it was because I knew I didn't have much time left and I didn't want to be alone...
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Anyway, thank you for taking the time to play with me.
Traveler: ...
Hanyuuda Chizuru: When we played Akitsu Yuugei, Paimon said the loser would have to grant the winner a wish.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: At the time, I wished for us to never cross paths again.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: However, you still came and found me, meaning you never granted my wish. So... can I make another wish?
Traveler: Of course.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Let me think... I wish for you to remember me... Ah no, I only have one wish, so I'd better make it count.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Okay, listen carefully. My wish is...
Hanyuuda Chizuru: "I wish that every day of your journey ahead will be filled with joy like a festival."
Traveler: As long as I can fulfill it.

## Talk 15

Yoimiya: Every year, when the fireworks go off, I say to myself, "Another year has already passed."
Yoimiya: As each year passes by, your life gradually approaches its end.
Yoimiya: But I don't think that's a bad thing. Like I always say, fireworks are for now, but friends are forever.

## Talk 16

Yae Miko: When Ayato approached me about holding the Test of Courage event, it dawned on me that this would be the perfect opportunity to help Chizuru face her problem.
Yae Miko: Kamai and the samurai's parting was one of the first things she experienced when she was partially sentient and didn't have her human form yet.
Yae Miko: This was a very traumatic experience for her, and she could never come to grips with it by reasoning alone.
Yae Miko: The best option was for her to directly interact with humans. There's no need to feel sad, I believe she was content when she left us.

## Talk 17

Arataki Itto: Lifespans, partings... It really gets you thinking, doesn't it? ...But uh, I got nothing.
Arataki Itto: Alls I know is that I'll never regret meeting you! Hahaha!

## Talk 18

Gorou: It was heartbreaking to learn of Chizuru's story.
Gorou: To be honest, I experience that same kind of sorrow when I'm on the battlefield. I don't know when I'll lose my comrades, so I try to appreciate every moment.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Kamisato Ayaka: Ah, after hearing Chizuru describe the original Mikawa Flower Festival, I wanted to arrange another chance to talk with her about it.
Kamisato Ayaka: I didn't expect that would be our last conversation...

### Additional Talk 2

Shikanoin Heizou: Will you have some time in the next few days, Kazuha?
Shikanoin Heizou: I'd like you to work on a case with me.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Oh? Did you run into some trouble?
Shikanoin Heizou: Not exactly. It's just an old case with almost no tangible leads.
Shikanoin Heizou: But I believe your attuned sense of nature might allow us to discover some new clues.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Sure. I can stay after the festival and we can go investigate together.
Shikanoin Heizou: Great, thank you!
Kaedehara Kazuha: My pleasure. It's no trouble at all.

### Additional Talk 3

Thoma: Even though I knew my lord had most likely planned everything before the Test of Courage even began, I was still caught off guard.
Thoma: But, in retrospect, it was a lot of fun.

### Additional Talk 4

Sayu: Zzz... I've grown taller... hehe...
Sayu: I'm so tall... Everyone else looks so tiny now... Zzz...

### Additional Talk 5

Paimon: Itto! And Gorou! What are you two talking about?
Arataki Itto: Oh, I was just saying that if I had more time, I'd have built a massive fishing pond here!
Gorou: Fishing... You know, when I lived on Watatsumi Island, I used to just dive into the sea and catch fish with my bare hands.
Arataki Itto: Haha! Take it from an expert, using your hands to catch fish is nowhere near as fun as using a fishing rod!
Arataki Itto: Just the other day I caught a fish so big that I didn't even know how to handle it... I even wrote a letter to Yae Publishing House about it.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: That's an unusual problem to have...
Paimon: Huh? A big fish? How come you didn't tell us? Paimon could have helped you eat it!
Gorou: Huh? You wrote a letter to Yae Publishing House?
Arataki Itto: You bet I did! I wrote to the "That's Life" column and asked Miss Hina for advice. She's so amazing, she got back to me really quickly, too!
Gorou: Huh, what a coincidence. I do some part-time work there, and I recently received a similar letter.
Arataki Itto: You mean the letter was about dealing with a giant fish they caught? No... could it be...
Arataki Itto: Could it be that there's someone as good at fishing as I am? Not on my watch... Hey, you all go enjoy the festival, I'm gonna get out there and catch an even bigger fish!
Arataki Itto: Just you wait, I'll be inviting you all to my fish feast! Hahaha!
Hitotsume Kozou: Ah, the string snapped! I was so close!
Hitotsume Kozou: Yoimiya, this is more difficult than it looks. Can you really fish out these water balloons with a string?
Yoimiya: Don't worry. Let me show you a little trick. Just remember that your hand has to be quick!
Paimon: Yo-yo Tsuri! Paimon's seen this game in some light novels before!
Yoimiya: Do you want to give it a shot? Close one eye, aim carefully, and fish it out quickly!
Paimon: #Oh, it looks kinda tricky. Paimon will let Traveler try. You have to catch at least three water balloons since there's three of us.
Hitotsume Kozou: Uh, but Yoimiya, if I close one eye, I won't be able to see anything!
Sayu: Mmm, this ramen is so good...
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes, it feels like it's been ages since the last time I had some.
Paimon: Hmm? You mean you don't get to eat ramen very often, Ayaka? But it's so delicious!
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, it's you. We'll need two more bowls of ramen, please.
Kamisato Ayaka: Food like ramen and hotpot tend to have a lot of oil and salt, so I don't get to eat them very often.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Oh, that's unfortunate.
Paimon: Yeah, now Paimon totally gets why Ayaka would put cake into hotpot.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Huh?
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, uh... please, no need to bring that up again...
Sayu: Whew, I'm stuffed... and feeling a little sleepy. I'm just gonna... take a nap...
Kamisato Ayaka: By the way, were there any special stalls at youkai festivals in the past?
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Yes, but... Well, it's a long story.
Paimon: Paimon can't believe you couldn't get a single water balloon. You've gotten rusty!
Paimon: Chizuru managed to finally get one and gave it to Hitotsume Kozou...
Hanyuuda Chizuru: He looked like he really wanted it.
Paimon: But Paimon wanted one, too!
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Alright, then I'll catch one for you next time.
Paimon: Yay!
Thoma: C'mon now, this is way more expensive than usual! Even if it is a festival, you shouldn't hike up the prices this much.
Tomohiro: Hey now, it costs money to run a stall! I need to raise my prices to help cover the expenses, you know.
Thoma: Fair enough, how about five masks for 30% off? Final offer.
Tomohiro: Alright, alright...
Kappa: Ah, it's so hot. Feels like I'm being roasted here!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Don't get too close, it's better to keep a few steps back.
Kappa: I know... It's just so rare to see such a nice bonfire! I want to get as close as I can to enjoy it.
Kaedehara Kazuha: There are many beautiful things in the world, there's no need to be anxious. The festival has only just begun...
Yae Miko: I was surprised that you didn't even tell your sister. It seems she was quite frightened, too.
Kamisato Ayato: It would have been uninteresting had I told her what was going to happen ahead of time.
Kamisato Ayato: Besides, with her friends by her side, she wouldn't ever be too scared. Having a little fright is good to release any tension she might have accumulated lately.
Yae Miko: Hehe, everything went according to plan. People started to panic as soon as they sensed that they had no idea what was happening. Ah, how amusing.
Kamisato Ayato: Hehe... Yes, well done.
Paimon: Hey, you two! Stop laughing! It was scary!
Yae Miko: Hmm? Have you finished exploring the festival?
Traveler: Just about.
Yae Miko: Well then, are you having a good time?
Paimon: Yeah! It's great!
Yae Miko: The original Mikawa Flower Festival was much more lively. But even if you could attend the original, you probably wouldn't be as happy as you are now.
Yae Miko: Because it's always more fun to enjoy a festival with friends, isn't it?
Hanyuuda Chizuru: ...Yes. Thank you.
Yae Miko: #Well then, I'm guessing you have something you want to say to him alone? We'll leave you in peace.
Paimon: Hmm? What did you want to say to us?
Hanyuuda Chizuru: Ah, you saw through me again... I can't help but feel you somehow know everything.
Yae Miko: It's not that I "know everything." It's just that I've been in your position before.
Hanyuuda Chizuru: ...
Hanyuuda Chizuru: #Traveler, do you have a moment? I'd like to talk to you... alone on the beach.
