# Three Realms Gateway Offering: Aftermath


## Talk 1

Paimon: Tsumi, we did it!
Tsumi: I can tell. It looks like all three towers have been successfully taken care of.
Tsumi: The evacuation is now going much more quickly thanks to the improved environmental conditions. Most of the soldiers have gotten out...
Tsumi: But it seems like something happened that I hadn't foreseen. Please come with me.

## Talk 2

Paimon: There's darkness churning inside the Dainichi Mikoshi!
Tsumi: Logically speaking, all of Enkanomiya should be back to normal by now...
Tsumi: Unfortunately, this place has now become the most dangerous of all. I don't know why this is happening or what to do about it.
Tsumi: But what I can tell you is the location of the guy behind all of this. I'm going to have to ask you to confront him and make him reveal his whole plan.
Paimon: How did this happen?
Tsumi: I've been observing the flow of the darkness and I've noticed something peculiar.
Tsumi: There was a faint vortex continuously absorbing the darkness. I can only assume that the flow must be triggered by his need for Abyssal energy.
Tsumi: He is extremely dangerous. Even most vishaps would be no match for him...
Traveler: Don't worry. I've been waiting for a chance to let loose on him.
Tsumi: Music to my ears. Thank you.
Tsumi: If I have deduced correctly, he should be in the <color=#00E1FFFF>library</color> area right now.
Traveler: Don't worry. He's a glutton for punishment.

## Talk 3

The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": Oh, hey. I would say this is a nice surprise, but... it's really not that surprising. Look at you, venturing out into the darkness, doggedly fighting your way through, just to come and see me.
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": You're the only person I can think of who could actually pull that off. Still, what's with you joining forces with them? Didn't expect that.
Paimon: You're just trying to stall for time with small talk again!
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": ...Huh. I guess maybe you're not so clued up after all.
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": Look, I understand that seeing me has gotten you a little agitated. But frankly, the fact that you're still so fired up and raring to go after the long journey here is a bit of a problem for me.
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": So let's burn off that excess energy with a little exercise, huh! Just to calm you down enough to hear me out.

## Talk 4

The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": Stop, stop! My life is flashing before my eyes!
Traveler: Oh, then I'm not finished just yet!
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": That woman, with the slender pupils, what does she call herself?
Paimon: Huh, how do you know about her?
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": Her name. What is it?
Paimon: She calls herself Tsumi.
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": Hmph. That Reptilian seems to be doing a pretty good job of human imitation.
Traveler: Reptilian...
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": Makes sense, doesn't it? The Bathysmal Vishaps are a highly intelligent and fast-evolving kind. There have been legends about this for over a thousand years now.
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": The "Vishap-people."
Paimon: "Vishap-people"? Huh, sounds like the kind of nickname Paimon comes up with all the time.
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": Well this one comes from an old Enkanomiyan legend. When the Bathysmal Vishaps were defeated, they began evolving to survive. That is to say, they imitated the victors.
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": Eventually, this gave rise to a line of vishaps who were indistinguishable from humans except for their pupils. These were the Vishap-people. The story goes that they gradually infiltrated Enkanomiya and took over many high-ranking positions.
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": Remind you of anyone?
Paimon: We did hear that Tsumi's pupils are vertical...
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": Yep. In good lighting, you can see that reptiles' pupils are thin, vertical lines. That's hard evidence that she's betrayed you right there.
Paimon: But she's been helping us.
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": She is just using you to get revenge on me. I mean, I betrayed them first.
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": I formed an alliance with the vishaps. I said I'd plunge all of Enkanomiya into darkness so they could send their elites into the Dainichi Mikoshi and rescue their captive kin.
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": In return, they'd allow the Abyss Order safe passage through their territory and help me rebuild the three towers.
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": But they didn't know that the darkness of the Abyss was a terrible poison to elemental beings.
Paimon: So they thought you had betrayed them?
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": I mean, I totally did betray them. To be fair, it'd be pretty humiliating for the Abyss Order if we unleashed the power of the Abyss on them and they were just frolicking around with no side effects.
Paimon: You are pure evil!
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": Well, here's where we are now: Once she's done with you, she'll use the power of the Dainichi Mikoshi to suppress the Sangacorallia and create darkness to protect the vishaps.
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": They are probably diving down into the depths to rescue their imprisoned companions as we speak. It won't be long before the source of Bloodbranch Coral is completely cut off.
Paimon: Hmm, poor Bathysmal Vishaps, but still...
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": If you still want to save Watatsumi Island, you're gonna have to hurry.
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": You can use the mechanism I left behind to guide the light and dispel the darkness in the Dainichi Mikoshi.
Paimon: We don't believe a single word that comes out of your mouth!
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": Ugh, come on guys, do you honestly have another choice?
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": This is just another fruitless trip to Enkanomiya for me at this point. But no biggie. I'm just a marginal figure in the Order.
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": Unlike those who are falling over themselves to serve our Highness, I'm interested in more inconsequential things.
The Thing Calling Itself "Enjou": Yikes, I think I'm all out of time here. I'd better go. I would say "see ya," but... I probably won't. Here, I've got a parting gift for you. It's something I picked up at the Dainichi Mikoshi.
Paimon: This looks like part of the same set as the one that Kokomi gave us... Wait, now's not the time for that...
Paimon: Ugh, Paimon's so angry! He got away again!
Paimon: We can't trust that guy, even if he sounds like he's making sense. So let's go back to Tsumi and ask her about all this.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Oh no, Tsumi's gone...
Paimon: We couldn't have missed her on the way here...
Traveler: ...Why does it always end like this.
Paimon: Aw, c'mon, it's okay. Don't be sad.
Paimon: On the bright side, most of the soldiers have been successfully evacuated. If any vishaps did come through here just now, at least no one will have gotten hurt.
Paimon: Even though just thinking about that guy drives Paimon nuts, it seems we've got no choice but to give what he said a shot. Let's get some light in here.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Paimon's shocked. It actually worked!
Paimon: For once, he didn't lie to us.
Traveler: Technically speaking, he's never really lied to us.
Paimon: Well maybe with his sneaky way of explaining things, he doesn't have to! Why does Paimon feel like you two have reached some sort of mutual understanding!? That is not okay!
Paimon: The Dainichi Mikoshi should be accessible again now. Let's get down there and see.

## Talk 7

Paimon: After a careful headcount, it seems like the baby vishaps aren't here anymore. Guess they got rescued...
Paimon: If the Bathysmal Vishaps really did come down here, that means that guy was telling the truth...
Paimon: So... Tsumi really is a Vishap-person?
Paimon: But we still haven't seen her anywhere. Where the heck is she?
Paimon: *sigh* Whatever. Let's head back up.

## Talk 8

Paimon: It's Tsumi! Uh, what is she doing in front of the Dainichi Mikoshi?
Tsumi: Since you came back, I'm curious to know â€” did our rescue operation succeed?
Paimon: Some baby vishaps were rescued before we got there. But the old and weak vishaps went back in the water to hide after we defeated the elites.
Paimon: Um, Tsumi... Are you really a Vishap-person?
Tsumi: I have no intention of explaining anything. Although I can communicate with you, I know all too well that interaction with humans can only end in betrayal.
Tsumi: The conflict between our two kinds will go on forever.
Tsumi: Before I leave, I'm going to destroy this light.
Traveler: You think you have what it takes?
Tsumi: Do not come any closer. And don't even think about trying to sneak up on me.
Tsumi: This tower seems to hear my wishes... I just need to think the thought and it will change its brightness.
Tsumi: And if I so desire, it will collapse before me.
Tsumi: With the cognitive equivalent of a click of the fingers, I could destroy this source of great pain for the vishaps.
Tsumi: So why... why can't I do it...?
Paimon: #Oh no, this is way more serious than losing access to the Bloodbranch Coral! What're we gonna do, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: Tsumi, do you recognize these?
Tsumi: It's...
Black Screen Text: Tsumi remembers her pendant. She combines it with the other pieces.
Paimon: It's a pendant in the shape of... are those three entwined snakes?
Tsumi: This pendant has been with me for as long as I can remember. Why does it fit with your two pieces?
Traveler: I think deep down, you already know the answer.
Tsumi: Don't be ridiculous. Are you trying to say that... that I...
Paimon: Paimon doesn't understand... This one is Kokomi's, this one is from the Dainichi Mikoshi, and Tsumi's has been with her all along...
Traveler: You belong to Watatsumi Island.
Tsumi: ...
Tsumi: I grew up with the vishaps. My only possessions were this pendant and a few boxes of books. I learned human language and writing from them.
Tsumi: But not long after that, Enkanomiya was left without a single human being. It became completely empty.
Tsumi: Only recently did I finally have the chance to make contact with humans and learn what the things I'd read in the books really meant.
Paimon: Tsumi...
Tsumi: There is a saying in your human books that I've never understood until right now.
Tsumi: "People belong where they are born, but creatures belong where they are fed." I am a vishap, not a human. So I'm going back to where I belong.
Tsumi: I guess the Dainichi Mikoshi isn't my concern. But we'll be back one day.
Paimon: Tsumi is gone.
Paimon: Why did she suddenly change her mind in the end?
Traveler: Maybe Kokomi knows.
Paimon: Right. Kokomi will have definitely anticipated this possibility. That would be why she gave us the pendant fragment in the first place.
Paimon: Everything's resolved here. Let's go back and tell her.
Traveler: Tsumi, these are for you.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Hey, Kokomi!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ah, you're back. The soldiers briefed me about what happened.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: You successfully worked with a shrine maiden named Tsumi to clear the darkness, but then there was an unexpected change at the Dainichi Mikoshi. Is that so?
Paimon: Yeah, that's right. But after that is where things started to get all kinds of weird.
Black Screen Text: You tell Kokomi what had happened.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Really?
Paimon: Uhh, sorry, Kokomi... Paimon feels kinda bad that we ended up giving your pendant away.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: There's no need to apologize. As I said, Watatsumi Island has no further need for it.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It's a relic from back in the very beginning, when the Watatsumi Omikami reorganized the court and reformed Enkanomiya. The three pendants were given to the Dainichi Mikoshi, the Sangonomiya line, and the Vassals of Watatsumi.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The original intention was that the common folk, the officials, and the divine vassals would all hold each other accountable. But today, only the common folk have flourished, while the other two bloodlines have declined. So the pendant is of little use anymore.
Paimon: Funny you should say vassals... One of the soldiers seemed to think that Tsumi was one of those. But actually, her vertical pupils meant that she was a reptile... She fooled us all.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: That's not true. Vassals of Watatsumi typically take on a half-human, half-snake form, symbolizing that they are the familiars of our serpent god. At least, they used to. Over time, the vassals gradually became identical to humans â€” all except for the pupils of their eyes.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: But Vishap-people and Reptilians... they're pure fiction. There is no evidence for their existence anywhere among Sangonomiya's classified documents.
Paimon: Oh, so Tsumi isn't actually a vishap?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The Watatsumi Omikami exhausted its power to create Watatsumi Island, and after that, it grew weaker and weaker. No more Vassals of Watatsumi were born after that. But the records do mention the very last of the vassals...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: All our hopes were placed onto her. She was going to be the one who could communicate between the vishaps and the humans. But when she was just an infant girl, she and her guardian shrine maiden were attacked by vishaps at the border of Enkanomiya. Her whereabouts have been unknown ever since.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Most believe she died that day. But some believe she was raised by the vishaps.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The people of Watatsumi owe a great debt of gratitude to the Vassals of Watatsumi. Now that the vishaps and Watatsumi Islanders no longer have a territorial dispute, I sincerely hope that she will find her way to where she belongs... wherever that is for her.
Paimon: What a story...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Still, now that we know how Bloodbranch Coral works, I, as Divine Priestess of Sangonomiya, may need to think of a new way to counteract the Holy Soil phenomenon.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: For the time being, however, the issue is resolved, and all thanks to you. Watatsumi Island will be at peace for many decades to come.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I can't thank you enough.
