Paimon: Aisa Bathhouse... Well, based on the letter, this should be the place.
Paimon: It looks familiar... Hm, we've walked past here several times before, right? Just never gone inside.
Aikawa Susumu: Are you here to visit the Aisa Bathhouse?
Paimon: Whoa! Where'd you come from!?
Aikawa Susumu: Oh, sorry... Forgive me, I didn't mean to intrude. We've been struggling to attract customers recently, so I got a little over-excited when I heard you discussing my bathhouse...
Paimon: "Your" bathhouse? So you run the place, huh? And business isn't going so great, you say?
Aikawa Susumu: Oops... please, forget I said that, it just slipped out. Now, do you have an appointment?
Paimon: Uhh... we have a VIP pass. Can we use it now?
Aikawa Susumu: What? ...Ugh, I've told them before, a promotional gimmick isn't gonna magically fix our business. Who issued this thing... Wait, is that Miss Yumemizuki's signature?
Aikawa Susumu: I'm so sorry, I had no idea you were invited here by Miss Yumemizuki... Please, feel free to redeem your VIP pass now if you'd like. Just give your names at reception.
Paimon: Sounds like she has a lot of clout... But aren't you supposed to be the boss?
Aikawa Susumu: I am, yes, but Miss Yumemizuki is a major shareholder. The business never would've gotten off the ground without her investment...
Paimon: What?
Aikawa Susumu: It's no cause for alarm though — she's a very responsible person. In addition to being a shareholder, she's also personally involved in our day-to-day business.
Aikawa Susumu: She only returned to Inazuma recently — otherwise, I'm sure you'd have heard of her by now. She's a highly renowned clinical psychologist.
Aikawa Susumu: Please, head on in.
