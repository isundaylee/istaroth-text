## Talk 1

Qiaoxi: Thanks for helping clear out the monsters. I am sorry to have to ask you — I know it should be my job, I just really need your help...
Qiaoxi: *sigh* If only we had more men, there'd be no issue.

## Talk 3

Qiaoxi: I can't cope...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Qiaoxi: Hmm? Who goes there? All who wish to cross this bridge are subject to interrogation, those are the rules.
Qiaoxi: That said... Just look at what you're wearing! You're definitely not someone I need to worry about...
Qiaoxi: Why? Think about it — criminals would want to dress as discreetly as possible, no? You, on the other hand, are dressed most ostentatiously indeed.
Qiaoxi: What are you doing here?
Qiaoxi: I am the Millelith responsible for this zone. This is a major thoroughfare to Dihua Marsh. Merchants and tourists all pass this way, so I'm stationed here to stand guard.
Qiaoxi: Just the other day, I discovered a group of monsters nearby... It appears they've set up a camp, and although they haven't made a move yet it's definitely a safety risk. I need to keep an eye on them.
Qiaoxi: I'd happily go and clear them out... except, I worry that if I left my post here, some other monsters would seize the chance to ambush passers-by. I feel so helpless, stuck here all day...
Traveler: I dealt with the monsters.
Qiaoxi: Seriously? All of them? That's... fantastic!
Qiaoxi: This was a huge help. I am sorry I had to ask you — it should have been my job, but you ended up doing it all for me...
Qiaoxi: Ugh, I don't know what the higher-ups are thinking, they really should have sent some more people by now. This zone is far too big for only one person...
Qiaoxi: They will be getting a full report on this situation as soon as I have the opportunity.
Qiaoxi: You have my thanks. Please take these for your trouble.

## Talk 5

Qiaoxi: How is it coming along?
Traveler: I have dealt with the monsters.
Qiaoxi: Thank you, it's a huge help. I am sorry I had to ask you — it should have been my job, but you ended up doing it all for me...
Qiaoxi: ...There's no point you trying to play it down, you're covered in dust, which I'm sure is from a tooth-and-nail battle with the monsters.
Qiaoxi: Ugh, I don't know what the higher-ups are thinking, they really should have sent some more people by now. This zone is far too big for only one person...
Qiaoxi: It may be just a couple of bridges, but so much human traffic comes through here every day. If anything were to happen here, it would be catastrophic...
Qiaoxi: The higher-ups will be getting a full report on this situation as soon as I have the opportunity.
Qiaoxi: You have my thanks. Please take these for your trouble.
