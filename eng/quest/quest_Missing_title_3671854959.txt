# Missing title (3671854959)

Scene Notes: This is a cut scene of the show "Brokeboat Mountain"
Scene Notes: Originally, the story showed two Hydro Eidolons on board a broken boat, floating along, who fall deeply in love.
Scene Notes: After confessing their feelings for one another, they stand upon the prow of the boat illuminated by the afterglow of the sunset. The scene is extremely romantic.
Scene Notes: However, this scene was abandoned because... the two Hydro Eidolons acting the part were simply too energetic and couldn't stop moving for the big romantic scene.
Scene Notes: If only I could catch <color=#00E1FFFF>two of them on the prow of the boat at the same time</color>, the scene would be perfect...
