Traveler: What event are you referring to?
Yamada: It's something that happened after the Vision Hunt Decree came out. Someone bit off more than he could chew by challenging the Vision Hunt Decree enforcers from the Tenryou Commission to a duel before the throne.
Yamada: Naturally, this imprudent guy was promptly defeated and received divine punishment from the Almighty Shogun... *sigh* What an awful way to go, now that I think about it...
Yamada: But to everyone's surprise, the Vision that the defeated man had lost was taken away by another young lad who barged onto the scene!
Yamada: That Vision, which should have become a part of the statue of the Almighty Shogun, is now in the hands of some unknown ronin... Alas, what a terrible omen!
