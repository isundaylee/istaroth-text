## Talk

Sakuya: Hello there! How would you like to grow some flowers of your very own?

## Talk

Traveler: About the flowers...
Sakuya: Would you like to have some fun with growing flowers and ikebana? Sure.

## Talk

Traveler: About the flowers...
Sakuya: You might want to plant the seeds that you already have first. Everything in its good time, as they say.

Traveler: About the flowers...
Sakuya: My apologies, but this iteration of Dreams of Bloom has ended. I need to tend to my business in the flower field now.
Sakuya: Swing by and have some fun the next time I organize similar events.

## Talk

Traveler: So, tell me about ikebana...
Sakuya: Ikebana is very important to Inazuma.
Sakuya: In simple terms, you can consider ikebana the act of carefully cutting and processing flowers and other plants before arranging them in a suitable fashion...
Sakuya: In specific, however, you need to take care to grasp the current state of the plants and trim the less presentable parts of them away...
Sakuya: Moreover, your arrangement and placement must be suited to their environment, even down to the angle at which the flowers extend outward...
Sakuya: These details must be given fastidious consideration, and can be a cumbersome process indeed.
Sakuya: Even for someone who loves ikebana like me, it is a most tiring job...

Traveler: Goodbye.
Sakuya: Mm, see you.
