# Where the Treasure Dwells


## Talk 1

Paimon: Let Paimon see! Hmm... This looks like it might be some kind of treasure map.
Traveler: Really?
Paimon: Heh! Paimon's never wrong when she's on the scent of treasure!
Paimon: Huh, it seems like "Ako Domeki and company" were the ones who left this picture behind. Feels like we've heard that one before, y'know?
Paimon: Also, look at this! "The treasure is hidden..." See? There's treasure to be had, alright!
Paimon: Let's keep reading... "... Was split into four parts..."
Paimon: So they split something into four parts, huh?
Traveler: So there's four treasures?
Paimon: Paimon's not... super sure?
Paimon: But whatever the case, it says here that something was "placed amidst the reefs of the four large islands." That should refer to the reefs on the four islands of the Golden Apple Archipelago.
Paimon: Wait, isn't this one of those reefs?
Traveler: Hmm, that means there must be four clues...
Paimon: And they should be close to the reefs on the four islands!
Paimon: Hmmm, that's gotta refer to the four biggest ones in the archipelago, right?
Paimon: Let's give the other three islands a shot and see what we can find!
Traveler: So there's four clues?

## Talk 4

Paimon: Well, that makes four clues gained...
Paimon: ...Uhh, Paimon can't tell where this treasure is supposed to be hidden at all...
Paimon: What does this "radius" and "center" stuff mean, anyway?
Traveler: It just means that we need to use the circles as a reference...
Paimon: Oh, is that it? Then we just need to draw four circles on the map and... uh, actually, how long is a "large boat-length"?
Traveler: Let's take reference from some ships we've seen before...
Paimon: Yeah, we could probably refer to the big ships we've seen in the harbor... Hmm...
Black Screen Text: Paimon draws four circles on the map as instructed.
Paimon: Ooh, there's our four circles now. So the treasure is where all four circles overlap, huh?
Paimon: Aaaand that's the spot!
Traveler: They mean the center of the circles...

## Talk 5

Paimon: So this is the treasure left by Ako Domeki and his crew? Hmm... But could they really have left the treasure here of all places back then?
Paimon: It seems kinda weird no matter how you look at it...
Traveler: Not to mention the mountains on Pudding Isle...
Paimon: Yeah! Didn't those only appear because of the machine? Could they really have hidden this treasure, then?
Traveler: Perhaps the treasure itself wanted to be found...
Paimon: Y'know, you've got a point. Maybe the wish of those who buried the treasure, that someone should find it someday, was affected by the machine...
Paimon: Well, whatever the case, it's ours now!
Traveler: Not to mention the Captain Night Raven on Twinning Isle...
