Traveler: I want to go fishing too!
Jiangxue: You have far more important things to do.
Jiangxue: You don't want to follow in my footsteps. I'm just waiting around for my life to come to an end.
Jiangxue: Reason being, I did what I had to do, and now it's done.
Traveler: What did you have to do?
Jiangxue: I think you already know the answer to that. Because like you, I used to be one of the chosen ones in this world.
Jiangxue: The difference is, I used my power to do some bad things.
Jiangxue: I gave up my Vision. I'm not worthy of it anymore, nor do I have any real use for it.
