Sheikh Zubayr: Him, he's a man of mediocre talent. His movements on stage are stiff and his singing is less in tune than Swoof's.

Sheikh Zubayr: After all, I can't expect everyone to be as gifted as Nilou.
Sheikh Zubayr: Ah, that reminds me, I still have more to discuss with him regarding the lines of the new script...
