Yun Jin: Hmm, would you look at that... the name of this room is the "Feiyun Study Room."
Yun Jin: Its name contains the word "yun," just like my own name... It looks like I have a special connection with this room.
Yun Jin: Haha, I'm kidding, of course. It is most definitely to my liking, though. Furnished with all the supplies one could possibly hope for in a study. I am truly grateful.
