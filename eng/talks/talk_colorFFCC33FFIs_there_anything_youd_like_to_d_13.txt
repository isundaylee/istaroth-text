Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Is there anything you'd like to do?</color>
Tartaglia: Hmm... When can you spare a few weeks?
Tartaglia: I want to take you to see the scenery of my homeland.
Tartaglia: To gaze upon the endless snowy sky, to stand on frozen lakes that won't shatter, no matter how hard you tread.
Tartaglia: Some people even carve gigantic ice sculptures there.
Tartaglia: If you like snowball fights, I'll pair with you and we can face off against my siblings.
Tartaglia: Oh, and I almost forgot! I can also make authentic Borsch for you with specialty ingredients from my hometown.
Tartaglia: ...And, of course, we have to go ice fishing! The fish are much larger than the ones you find in ponds.
Traveler: Sounds like a blast!
Tartaglia: Alright, it's settled then!
Tartaglia: Mmm, seems like I'll have to give my family a heads-up.
Tartaglia: I can see it now, the beaming smiles on their faces as they gather around and read the letter.
Traveler: Can't wait!
