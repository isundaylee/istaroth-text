La Gouttiere: "An Investigation Team That Doesn't Investigate, and a News Conference With No News"
La Gouttiere: Everyone knows about the massive explosion at the Fontaine Research Institute, but the cause has never been released to the public.
La Gouttiere: The investigation team held a lengthy investigation of the contents of their own desks, after which they held a press conference at which absolutely nothing was said.
La Gouttiere: The results they announced at the press conference were much like our expectations and description of the event itself: an "unfortunate accident." The investigation team is very satisfied with the result of having achieved no results whatsoever, as if the unfortunate press conference never happened at all.
La Gouttiere: As for any future reports on the truth of the matter, nobody will care. Ignoring the issues mentioned above, the most that can be said is that at least the punctuation in their report was trustworthy.
