Notebook: ...These blasted jars... What were they called again? *Energy storage devices* or something... They've been disappearing without a trace lately. I put one down, then it disappears. I put another one down, and it disappears too...
Notebook: ...I even posted someone to watch over it at night... They disappeared along with the jar...
