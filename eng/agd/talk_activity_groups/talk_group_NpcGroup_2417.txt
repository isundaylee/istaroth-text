## Talk

Uncle Liu: Hey, youngster. What can I do for you?

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing?
Uncle Liu: Ah, just reminiscing... Once you reach my age, kid, you find that remembering the past is more enjoyable than contemplating the future.
Uncle Liu: For instance, these days I keep finding myself thinking back to the way my next-door neighbor, Shuzhi, used to look in the prime of her youth...
Uncle Liu: Ah, the way I'd crouch behind the window and peek out at her... Sometimes she'd see me... even shot me a smile sometimes...
Uncle Liu: Boy, I'll never forget that smile. The dimples on her cheeks... that look in her eyes, like her smile was for me, and me alone...
Traveler: And? Where did it go from there?
Uncle Liu: Where did it go? ...What on earth do you mean?
Uncle Liu: ...You don't seriously think I... told her the way I felt!?
Uncle Liu: Whâ€”What is wrong with you? You honestly think a guy should just... straight up tell a girl how they feel!?
Uncle Liu: Tut-tut, you kids these days... Where's your sense of shame...

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Uncle Liu: You're only young once, kid. Don't end up like me... with nothing left but memories...
