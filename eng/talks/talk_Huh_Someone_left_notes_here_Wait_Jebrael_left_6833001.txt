# Talk Dialog

Paimon: Huh? Someone left notes here... Wait, Jebrael left these notes!
Paimon: Jebrael, that name sounds so familiar. Hey, isn't that...
Traveler: It's Jeht's father...
Paimon: Looks like Jebrael and Samail were still friendly at that time. They were from the same tribe, after all... Maybe they came here together.
Paimon: Hm... Is this stone they left on the side of the road actually the keystone from the records...
Paimon: #Paimon's really not sure how this thing might work... Hey, Traveler, do you have any idea what it can do?
Traveler: It's the stone slate.
Paimon: The symbol on the slate is lighting up!
Traveler: Samail's been mentioned as well...
