Trainee Cellar Guard Raven: Hey, it's been a while, hasn't it? Remember me? I was the night raven you caught hiding in the cellar, sleeping in the elevator! I did it! I've become a guard!
Trainee Cellar Guard Raven: Now I can join my brother in guarding the castle cellar... Ah, yes, this is just a small token of my appreciation for not telling on me. Again, thank you so much!
