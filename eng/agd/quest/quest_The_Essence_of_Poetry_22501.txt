# The Essence of Poetry


## Talk 1

Qingzhou: Hmm... No, this verse will not do. It won't do at all. *sigh* I really must go and see for myself...
Traveler: Is something the matter?
Qingzhou: How do you fare this day, my liege? My name is Qingzhou. I might add that I consider myself a poet, if I may be so bold.
Qingzhou: By some strange chance, I received a single strain of poetic inspiration of late, but I have yet to find a continuation worthy of its brilliance since...
Qingzhou: Recently, the skies have been strange, and meteorites have fallen in flame to the earth. It is truly a rare sight to see on this mortal plane.
Qingzhou: It came to my mind that if I were to gain some inspiration from observing one such meteorites up close, that next, elusive sentence in my poem may yet surface...
Traveler: Th—That might not be appropriate...
Qingzhou: Not appropriate? Whatever might you mean by that?

## Talk 2

Qingzhou: What are you referring to as "inappropriate"?
Traveler: You'll be knocked unconscious if you touch those meteorites...
Qingzhou: Ah, I've heard tell of this. But if I but observe them up close, nothing untoward will befall me, yes?
Traveler: Can you guarantee that you won't touch them?
Qingzhou: W—Well, I shall exercise restraint.

## Talk 3

Traveler: There's a better way to view those meteorites.
Qingzhou: A better way, you say? ...Hmm, you do have a point. If I but gaze into the meteor's flame, but ignore all that surrounds it, would that not be overly narrow of me?

## Talk 4

Traveler: You can write poetry from here, can't you?
Qingzhou: That simply won't do, my liege. If I stay cloistered and safe all my life, then what would the poems I write be, if not the groans of the healthy, or the pontifications of a fool?

## Talk 5

Traveler: There are monsters near those meteorites.
Qingzhou: Haha, of course. I have traversed many a place in Liyue, and have seen many a foul beast. If the road is indeed too dangerous, then I shall just hire a guard.

## Talk 6

Traveler: Not everything you write has to shock the world, right?
Qingzhou: You speak truly — the best verses are divinely inspired, and the finest hands are guided by chance. And yet, this verse has plagued me for far too long. I must continue it somehow...

## Talk 7

Traveler: Will looking at a meteorite really inspire you?
Qingzhou: Ah, you think too little of me, my liege. Were I to gaze upon one, I would surely write you a fine verse.

## Talk 8

Traveler: But if you were to fall into a slumber...
Qingzhou: Of this you need not fret, my liege. I shall show the utmost restraint. Yet, if the meteorites do indeed consign people to slumber, one wonders what they dream of...
Qingzhou: Yes, how very curious... Ahem! I was merely theorizing. Do not worry, I will not put myself at such a risk.

## Talk 9

Traveler: Are you sure that you can deal with the risks?
Qingzhou: Well, I will bring a guard with me, naturally — just in case.
Traveler: It might be difficult to hire someone right now.
Qingzhou: Um... hmm. Yes, that's... You make a good question, my liege.

## Talk 10

Traveler: Inspiration doesn't guarantee good execution.
Qingzhou: Haha, Now, I do not mean to brag, my liege. But though I, Qingzhou, may lack talent, I have still published many a popular verse. You need not worry on my behalf.

## Talk 11

Traveler: Your writing's pretty good already.
Qingzhou: I am unworthy of such praise. But alas, how can a poet live with themselves if they cannot write poetry?

## Talk 12

Qingzhou: You have my thanks, my liege. This gift is unworthy by comparison, but do accept it.
Qingzhou: Flowers and meteorites... Now that certainly is new.

## Talk 13

Qingzhou: I have given your words much thought, my liege, and valid are your concerns. I shall not risk myself unnecessarily by seeking those meteorites out.
Traveler: That's good...
Qingzhou: What's more, a unique stroke does not good poetry make. It is in the many fine details that one's broader quality may be judged.
Qingzhou: We may be able to compose a fine verse from a flower or some other small object. Yet the number of poems written in praise of flora are many indeed...
Qingzhou: Hmm... It is said that outsiders see clearly, yes? Well then, Traveler, what sort of flower do you think I should as reference for composing my poem?

## Talk 14

Qingzhou: I have given your words much thought, my liege, but the meteorites are too rare a sight to be missed. I will go nonetheless.
Traveler: You...
Qingzhou: But if I were to immediately go close to those meteorites, I fear I might be attracted by them only, thus missing the world around them.
Qingzhou: A poet's worst nightmare is to have eyes for one thing only. If I were to merely observe those meteorites, I doubt that anything good should come from my brush.
Qingzhou: So I shall first observe them from afar, taking in the surroundings, before moving in for a closer look...
Qingzhou: And then... Hmm, wait. With so many monsters on the road, and no one to accompany me...
Qingzhou: Traveler, perhaps you might be so kind as to dispose of the monsters that might bar our path?
Traveler: Okay.
Qingzhou: Wonderful! Most splendid! I shall be depending on you, then.
Traveler: Just promise me you won't touch those meteorites...
Qingzhou: I—I... Alright, I promise. Come now, why would I put myself in harm's way when I know that touching them may put me in an unending slumber?
Qingzhou: Yet, one wonders what those consigned to such torpor by the meteorites might dream of...
Qingzhou: *coughs* I—I was just joking! Please help me deal with those monsters.

## Talk 15

Traveler: The Silk Flower, perhaps?
Qingzhou: That seems a fair choice. Even with the skies as they are, the Silk Flowers still bloom as they always have.
Qingzhou: There may be some value in juxtaposing the two...
Qingzhou: Could you gather three Silk Flowers for me, then? Perhaps having the objects close at hand may light my path.
Traveler: Got it.
Qingzhou: You have my utmost thanks, my liege.

## Talk 16

Traveler: Mist Flowers, perhaps?
Qingzhou: Mist Flowers. Hmm... There could be potential in comparing the falling meteorites to Mist Flowers.
Qingzhou: May I ask you to help me gather three Mist Flowers? Perhaps having such objects close at hand may light my path.
Traveler: Sure.
Qingzhou: You have my utmost thanks, my liege.

## Talk 17

Qingzhou: Have you gathered the Silk Flowers?
Traveler: I have them right here.
Qingzhou: Excellent. I shall receive them gladly.
Qingzhou: *sigh* Inspiration is indeed hard to come by...

## Talk 18

Qingzhou: Have you collected the Mist Flowers?
Traveler: Indeed I have.
Qingzhou: Excellent. I shall receive them gladly.
Qingzhou: *sigh* Inspiration is indeed hard to come by...

## Talk 19

Qingzhou: Ah, is this, then, a meteorite? Curious. Most curious...
Traveler: Don't touch it, now.
Qingzhou: Oh? Ah, it's you, my liege... I am aware of the danger. Please do not worry.
Qingzhou: Thank you for your aid. Please, take this small gift as a token of my esteem.
Qingzhou: This meteorite truly is an enigma... Hmm...
Paimon: Whoa... He's really into it, isn't he?
Paimon: Are you sure he heard what we told him? Ugh, Paimon's worried...

## Talk 20

Qingzhou: I have heard your advice, my liege, and I will heed it.
Qingzhou: As to whether we should approach the crash site or not, allow me to give it a little more consideration...

## Talk 21

Qingzhou: Touching a meteorite will see mortals cast into torpid somnolence... I wonder what fantasies unwind before them there?

## Talk 22

Qingzhou: Haha, it is doubtful that many have written about meteorites and flowers, surely...

## Talk 23

Qingzhou: Haha, it is doubtful that many have written about meteorites and flowers, surely...

## Talk 24

Qingzhou: You have my thanks, my liege. This gift is unworthy by comparison, but do accept it.
Qingzhou: Flowers and meteorites... Now that certainly is new.
