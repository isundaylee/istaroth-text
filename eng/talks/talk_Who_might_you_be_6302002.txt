Traveler: Who might you be?
Uesugi: I'm Doushin Uesugi of the Police Station. I'm a new recruit who just joined recently. Nice to meet you.
Uesugi: The Police Station's task is to maintain law and order in Inazuma. Our job is to handle the neighbors' reports.
Uesugi: However, these reports are mostly just little troubles that people run into during their daily life. There are also some amazingly clumsy mistakes...
Uesugi: Though I don't mind helping them take care of their problems, I still wish that I could handle some big cases so that my skills can finally be put to good use...
Uesugi: Otherwise, I'm going to end up like Owada â€” insignificant until my retirement. Honestly, I don't want to become like him at all.
