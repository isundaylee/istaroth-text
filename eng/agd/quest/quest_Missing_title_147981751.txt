Yae Miko: Hmm? Was there something else you wanted to talk about?
Traveler: About Dango Milk...
Yae Miko: I have no doubt that she immensely enjoyed that drink. I'm sure she was as happy as can be.
Yae Miko: What she really wanted to say was this: "How soon do you think you could open a branch in the Plane of Euthymia?"
Traveler: About the Raiden Shogun...
Yae Miko: The puppet, yes. I've also heard that changing a puppet's operating rules is extremely difficult.
Yae Miko: It's most likely the first time in history anyone has faced this issue. You can imagine how hard it must be, given that it has successfully flummoxed the wise and powerful Ei...
Yae Miko: This is one problem that even the Musou no Hitotachi will not be able to solve.
Traveler: About light novels...
Yae Miko: Don't you think it's a fun idea, someone being reborn as the Raiden Shogun? That's all that light novels are supposed to be â€” a bit of fun.
Yae Miko: For her, though... yes, probably a little too avant-garde.
Yae Miko: Ooh, maybe I should commission a sequel: Reborn as Guuji Yae. What do you think?
Traveler: I've got nothing else to say.
