# A Fine Opportunity?


## Talk 1

Cyrus: Drat... If only we had more manpower...
Traveler: Is something the matter?
Cyrus: Traveler? Great timing! You've seen the tempests that Stormterror's kicked up in Mondstadt, haven't you?
Cyrus: The Knights of Favonius have mobilized their full strength. Naturally, the Adventurers' Guild will not stand idly by. It is time for the people to witness our strength!
Cyrus: The Knights are in charge of internal security, but those foolish monsters outside the city walls are the specialty of the Adventurers' Guild.
Cyrus: The Guild's experienced hands have all been sent to various places to investigate. But... I just fear for Jack.
Cyrus: He volunteered to go to the Thousand Winds Temple, but we haven't heard from him since.
Cyrus: I like his spirit, but he's too rash sometimes and doesn't have enough experience. I worry that something might happen to him.
Cyrus: Traveler, if you are willing, could you help me go to the Thousand Winds Temple to look for Jack?

## Talk 2

Traveler: Sure thing.
Cyrus: Thank you! I must oversee the situation here at the Guild, or I would have gone myself.
Cyrus: I am counting on you. The Guild must not lose another young soul.

## Talk 3

Traveler: There are other things I need to do...
Cyrus: ...Alright. In such times, settling your own affairs is the wisest choice.

## Talk 4

Cyrus: Where has that kid Bennett run off to? *sigh* At a moment like this, no less... I hope he didn't run into any trouble...

## Talk 5

Jack: *hissing* That... hurts...
Jack: Thank you so much. I'd thought that I wouldn't be coming home today...
Traveler: How are you feeling?
Jack: Ha, it's just a little... *grunt* hurt! Just a little. I'm fine.
Jack: I discovered a group of hilichurls congregating in the camp ahead, and suspected that they might be up to something. So I followed them...
Jack: ...But I got too close, and they discovered me.
Jack: Never mind that, or me — please help to clear those hilichurls out!
Jack: Their numbers are increasing. We can't let their plans come to fruition.
Jack: As for me... I can take care of myself.

## Talk 6

Jack: You've cleaned them out, I suppose?
Traveler: Yup.
Jack: You really are very strong. If only I could be as outstanding as you...
Jack: I, too, would like to leave behind dragon-slaying, world-saving legends, but in the end, I couldn't even beat a pack of hilichurls...
Jack: Ugh... Anyway, I... This is embarrassing, but I have something to ask of you...
Jack: I actually came to the Thousand Winds Temple because I'm soon to take an Adventure Ranking test...
Jack: I thought that the ranking would go much more smoothly if I could show my stuff at this time.
Jack: I never thought that I'd not only have nothing to show for it, but almost lose my life in the process as well.
Jack: C—Could I ask you not to tell Cyrus about this? I'd truly be in hot soup if this were to affect my ranking...
Traveler: Your secret's safe with me.
Jack: Thank you so much! I promise I won't be so reckless in future!
Traveler: This isn't right...
Jack: I know it isn't, and Cyrus always says that adventurers should be honest with themselves...
Jack: But... *sigh* Forget it. I just hope he wont be too mad at me...

## Talk 7

Cyrus: You're back, and Jack too. But he's limping...
Cyrus: What happened?
Traveler: Jack rushed in, and got hurt as a result...
Cyrus: So it's as I thought. *sigh* He hasn't been listening to what I always tell him, has he?
Cyrus: I understand that he wants to prove himself, but...
Cyrus: Forget it. I understand what happened. I'll talk to Jack.
Cyrus: This is for you, consider it payment for your adventure.

## Talk 8

Cyrus: You're back, and so is Jack, I see, though he's limping.
Cyrus: What happened out there?
Traveler: Jack fought bravely.
Cyrus: Oh, you fought alongside him? So that's how he was injured.
Cyrus: *sigh* Bravery is good... but I'd rather that he were more steady. One can only be an adventurer if one stays alive.
Cyrus: Your bravery was commendable as well, traveler. Take this as your reward.
Traveler: Jack rushed in, and got hurt as a result...
Cyrus: So it's as I thought. *sigh* He hasn't been listening to what I always tell him, has he?
Cyrus: I understand that he wants to prove himself, but...
Cyrus: Forget it. I understand what happened. I'll talk to Jack.
Cyrus: This is for you, consider it payment for your adventure.

## Talk 9

Jack: *sigh* I really hope my ranking won't be affected by this...
