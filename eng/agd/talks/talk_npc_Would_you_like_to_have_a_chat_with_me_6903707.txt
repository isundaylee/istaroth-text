# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Ganyu: Sure... but I may not be able to offer any practical advice if our topic of discussion is not work-related.
Traveler: I just meant small talk.
Ganyu: Oh, aâ€”alright...
Ganyu: You know, I used to agonize a lot over whether to try and integrate into human society.
Ganyu: When our workload is light, my coworkers sometimes organize social events.
Ganyu: But my strict vegetarian diet is completely different from everyone else's. And I don't really share their interest in shopping or lively forms of entertainment.
Ganyu: Sometimes they can be quite critical... People say that my whole mindset is just fundamentally different from an ordinary person's...
Ganyu: But what can I do? It's hard to change your habits when they've been that way for thousands of years...
Traveler: I'll think of a social activity that you would find easier to accept.
Ganyu: Then it would only be proper for me to offer you something in return! Shall I take you out... for a meal? In a restaurant?
Traveler: We're friends, so there's no need for all that formality.
Ganyu: Ahh... Okay... Duly noted!
Traveler: Sounds good, I'll take the opportunity to share more knowledge with you.
Ganyu: ...Great, with your help, I'm sure I'll be able to integrate into human society in no time.
Traveler: I can go with you and help you slowly get accustomed.
Traveler: Don't worry about that.
