# White Chestnut Oak Wood

Timber obtained from White Chestnut Oak Trees. It strikes a balance between hardness and toughness, making it easy to process. Though it appears no different from most other wood, its color grows lighter once processed using methods common to the tribes of Natlan, becoming nearly white, hence the name.
Can be used to create furnishings.
