Traveler: Boat-tos?
Remande: Boat-tos! Photos of boats. Boats, photos — by which I mean pictures of the aquabuses.
Remande: I absolutely adore the aquabus network — really, I'd take a picture of every last detail if I could.
Remande: My dream is to someday recreate a scale clockwork model of an aquabus without needing to refer to the real object, or even pictures of it.
Remande: At this moment, I've reached the phase where I'm taking photos daily, and familiarizing myself with them. Wish me well, friend!
