Paimon: "I murdered Takatsukasa Isamu. I poisoned his cold medicine."
Paimon: "Though he appeared to be honest and honorable in public, in secret, he asked me to search out a new type of poison to get rid of those who opposed him."
Paimon: "He also said that if I refused, he would have me thrown in prison. He used my family to blackmail me."
Paimon: "He left me with no choice. I killed him with a new type of poison that I had someone purchase for me at the International Trade Association... To protect myself, I later framed my colleague Ryuuji."
Paimon: "But now it's only a matter of time before the detective uncovers everything. I know that I've made a big mistake, and that there's no escaping it now. Only death awaits me. I merely ask that my family be spared."
Paimon: Hey, this is the key to proving that Shiroyama was the murderer, right? That is, if he was telling the truth, of course.
