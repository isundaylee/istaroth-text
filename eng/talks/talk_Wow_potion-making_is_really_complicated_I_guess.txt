# Talk Dialog

Gorou: #Wow, potion-making is really complicated. I guess it's quite a time-consuming process, even for two people as capable as {NICKNAME} and Paimon.
Kirara: Yeah, watching them run around in circles like this is making me dizzy...
Paimon: Looks like we've still got some details to work out. Sorry to keep you waiting...
Gorou: No worries! Take as long as you need! In any case, I was hoping I'd get the chance to walk around a bit more and familiarize myself with the terrain. It'll give me a chance to buy some souvenirs and books as well.
Kirara: I guess I'll take some time for myself too... Hmm, where should I go... Ooh, I know! The Cat's Tail!
Gorou: #See you in a bit, {NICKNAME} and Paimon. Be sure to pace yourselves, alright? Don't go working too hard on our account!
