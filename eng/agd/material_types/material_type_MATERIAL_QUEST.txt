## Legend of the Shattered Halberd (I)

In ancient times when Axis Mundi was unobstructed, there were nine realms, each a world of its own. The realm of humans was known as the Zhongzhou, while the gods reside in Shenxiao.
At the end of the last calamity, a war between the gods broke out. The God King fell, setting the nine realms ablaze, obliterating all living things. The realms have now been born anew, life again thrives, but the passageway between the nine realms by Axis Mundi has been sealed off.
An all-new graphic novel on the epic journey in search of the God-King's Halberd begins!

Legend has that, the Celestial Emperor has a young daughter whose name was not known to the world; she now possessed Weiyang's body and revealed herself. Who would prevail? The wielders of the Ominous Swords who had turned into ferocious demons? Or Mir who could somewhat hold his own in a fight?

## Legend of the Shattered Halberd (III)

"Just stay with the name 'Weiyang' for convenience's sake on the road. With the official documents from the government in hand, you should be free to go as you wish throughout the kingdom."

Though they had already collected five Ominous Swords and all seemed to be well, they knew in their hearts that the way forward would only get more treacherous and perilous.

## "Dwelling in the Clouds" Blueprints

The designs for the Dwelling in the Clouds, built long ago by Cloud Retainer.

## Tainted Blood

Substance acquired from defeating Dvalin.
A crystal imbued with the winds of antiquity as well as another occult power from within the great dragon's body.

The mighty dragon was once a captive of a cage of toxicity, woven of three poisons:
The foul blood he once ingested, the lies whispered from the Abyss, and the anguish of abandonment.
Through tears shed and songs sung, the unholy spikes that had grown on Dvalin's body were smashed to pieces, and the web that had ensnared him was torn away...
Perhaps these feats were achievable only by a free-spirited traveler from a far-away land.

Fear of such horrors gradually subsided over the years as peace became the norm.
But no matter: though That Which Lies In The Deep awakens once more, it is powerless to prevent the dawning of a new era.

## Funerary Mask

A trophy obtained from defeating Signora, Eighth of the Fatui Harbingers.
The Fatui often face the world from behind their masks, and it is said that this is because all they once were will mean nothing once they become Fatui, and thus must they forsake their true names and faces alike.

â€”Yet the act of giving up all that makes up an "I" â€” one's past and the bonds that come with it â€” is no mean feat.
Perhaps it is fair to say that only those who possess an obsession close to or even exceeding the level of delusion might be willing to join this group that so rebels against the Heavenly Principles, binding their remaining days to their Delusions and burning as brightly as stars.

The woman whose real name was Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter may have once led a more innocent, naive existence.
But that was before her eyes were filled with a raging fire, and her innocent days were burned away. Before the icy Delusion extinguished the flaming tongues that ever gnawed her. Before the frozen might that protected her was shattered by the eternal outlander, unbound yet no less determined than she was, causing the flames to burst forth once more...

## Toki Alley Tales (Prologue)

They say that in the past, when the fragile and short-lived mortals had yet to cross over the sea unto these lands, Inazuma was once a land that belonged to the tanuki.

## Ore Slag

Slag left behind amidst some ore on Dragonspine. The valuable portions have been taken away, and the rest is just worthless, useless dross â€” or at least, that's how people might be inclined to see it. They would have carried it off as well otherwise, right?

A basic, common component often found in various creations of an ancient civilization, the function of which seems to be ensuring that these creations continue operating. Due to their close similarity in makeup to the components used in Pursina's Spikes, they can be used to replace its damaged parts. To think that Pursina's Spikes need such priceless objects to repair them... What a terrifyingly high-maintenance device.

A key that feels heavy in your hand. What door will it open?

## Northland Bank Check

A check with the emblem of the Northland Bank printed on it. It can be exchanged for Mora.

An Invigorating Kitty Meal made personally by Kiminami Anna. You're not certain if Neko will like it or not...

## A Preliminary Study of Sangonomiya Folk Belief

This paper was written by Shihab Purbiruni, a scholar of modern history from Sumeru, two years before the civil war in Inazuma. It details the folk beliefs of Watatsumi Island and the Sangonomiya people, and puts forward some relatively new academic propositions.

## The Life of Mouun the Shrine Maiden

For the people of Watatsumi, the legends of the Archon War are always filled with bitterness. Many of these millennia-old folksongs tell of a shrine maiden by the name of Mouun, who once rode upon the back of a sea monster, following the Great Serpent unto a tragic, moving end.

The "Viceroy of the East," or "Touzannou" sung of in Watatsumi folk tradition is also known as the "Akuou" all across Raiden's domains. He was the first vassal ruler of the Great Serpent Orobashi, and he was also the last.

## Treasured Tales of the Chouken Shinkageuchi (I)

The first part of a traditional Inazuman novel. This particular volume is also known as "Shinkageuchi," and was once a restricted text. It contains a fantastical tale about the first Raiden Shogun and her kagemusha, depicting the benevolent sagacity of the first Shogun and the great valor of her kagemusha. However, due to the great popularity of another book known colloquially as "Raiden Reincarnation," many people became interested in stories of this kind. This book thus wound up being published in a haphazard manner.

## Mysterious Stone

This object seems to carry the Ishine Script that was once used on Tsurumi Island.
Bring this stone back to its rightful place.

## Diary of Roald the Adventurer: Tsurumi Island

## Little Meng's Drifting Bottle

A bottle containing Little Meng's various troubles. You wonder what's inside...

It seems to have other unique properties as well that have yet to be discovered.

If you can find the other fragment, that should complete the picture.

## Treasure Hoarders' Treasure Map

This treasure map, once torn in two and kept in different hiding spots by the Treasure Hoarders, is now whole again.
If you follow the symbol on it, you might discover some special treasure!

## Storehouse Security Key No. 1

A key to a certain storehouse that was hidden in a very obvious place, yet was never found by the Treasure Hoarders. Guess they're not as good at their job as they think, huh?

## Storehouse Security Key No. 2

A key to a certain storehouse that was hidden in an incredibly obvious place, yet was never found by the Treasure Hoarders. They should probably go back to Hoarder school.

## A Set of Cannonballs

Cannonballs for the Mountainator, also known as the Safe Blasting Mechanism 2156. Although you used the Lumenstone Adjuvant to clear the unknown pollutants away, there is still a stench about them that can be detected even while covering your nose.
Ugh. Do you really have to touch it?

## Special Unmoving Essential Oil

A dangerous substance made using the formula that Clitopho provided by compressing two Unmoving Essential Oils into one very dense bottle filled with Geo elemental energy.
Due to its fame as a highly unstable concoction, only madmen or experienced miners would dare use it, making it an uncommon sight indeed.
Handle with utmost care!

## Key to a Stony Hall

According to Khedive's initial speculations, this construct may be a "key" that could open the door to some ruin somewhere.

## Photo of a Strange Rock

You took this picture of a strange rock that can be seen on the walls of The Chasm. You do not know what the patterns on the rock mean, but perhaps it could be of value to some researchers.

## Akademiya Recommendation Letter

This letter, carefully crafted, and it is sealed in the name of "Ecologist Khedive Pursina."
You got this as a gift from Khedive. He claims that this is even more precious than gold, and can gain you the help of the House of Purbiruni.
Khedive himself believes monetary remuneration to be something of an insult... Hopefully, this doesn't prove to be a trend with people from Sumeru.

## Orb of the Blue Depths

A strange gem left behind by a foe from the Abyss. If you look into it hard, it is almost as if you are looking into a long-borne dream shrouded by a deep fog.

A key wrought of metal that has been worn down with rust accumulated over many years.

## Miner's Key

Such keys are commonly found in the mines, but one wonders why it would appear here.

A toy belonging to miner Qi Ding's daughter. It looks pretty tattered and it's hard to imagine that any kid would like it. But the intricate stitch-work shows that this was once quite the pricey item.

## Flower of Farsight

One of the six lost offerings scattered throughout The Chasm... possibly? It seems just like an ordinary Qingxin, and one that has newly sprouted as well, seeing as how its white petals have never been touched by dew.
Who knows how many people have once climbed up to high heights to pick one such fresh flower? Who knows if these flowers eventually bore witness to partings or reunions?

## Skyfeather

One of the six lost offerings scattered throughout The Chasm, a feather that fell from an eagle that flew over the top of the cavern. The Millelith seem to enjoy collecting these tough feathers to use as ornaments.
It is said that eagle feathers fit valiant warriors best, and so tend to be used to decorate the armor and arms of the bravest, such that they might break the enemy formation with all the swiftness of that great bird of prey.

## Sundial of Ages

One of the six lost offerings scattered throughout The Chasm. It seems quite old now, but the etchings are still very clear, and so it can still be used.
The sun is a rare sight down in The Chasm, and it is easy to lose track of time. But someday, this sundial will once again track the passage of years.

## Cup of Commons

One of the six lost offerings scattered throughout The Chasm. Neither stone nor gem, it somehow still became part of the Treasure Hoarders' loot hoard.
It has been filled by turns with fine wine, fair treasure, and blood. Now, its previous shame has been washed away, and it is ready to take on new memories.

## Helm of Warding

One of the six lost offerings scattered throughout The Chasm. It was found hidden in the living quarters of the miners. A slightly less discerning eye might have mistaken it for a miner's hat.
It is heavily scarred and pitted, making one wonder how many miners' lives it must have saved.

## Warrior's Spear

One of the six lost offerings scattered throughout The Chasm. It was lost amid the ancient battlefield five hundred years ago. The long years have worn the edge of the spear-point away, but it still looks quite ominous nonetheless.
One can imagine that it was once wielded by a warrior most brave, earning the cheers of the young wherever it swept, even unto The Chasm itself.

## Brass Ring

A ring that you got off a Golden Weasel Thief. See how it glitters, see how it shines! The Weasel Thief must have planned on using it to attract a mate, and it does indeed look quite valuable. One imagines that its owner must be quite distressed at the moment.

## Archaic Stone

A strange, rare ore that was mined from The Chasm.
These rocks can only be found in the ore veins of the oldest mountains. It is so rare that most merchants have probably never heard of it.
However, the changes in The Chasm have led to the emergence of much low-quality Archaic Stone, a fact that has given the merchants of Huishan Hall quite the headache.

## Shriveled Seed

A seemingly withered object that seems to, by normal judgment, be a seed. However, it still has a surprising amount of life in it yet.
Best not to eat it for now...

## Date's Key

Date's key. Unfortunately, this will not open the treasury of a distinguished Enkanomiya family. It will only open the way to the Heterodoxa labyrinth.

## Pile of Lavender Melons

This pile of Lavender Melons may have been collected and placed here by some kind of animal. They look a bit like Onikabuto from a distance.

As you were walking down the streets of Inazuma, someone stuffed this note onto your person. Two strange symbols are drawn on it.

## Special Bamboo Slip

A Bamboo Slip upon which Momoyo has applied some specially made elemental powder. Store and handle it with care! The powder has some measure of poison in it â€” and of course, you'll get yelled at for improper handling.

## "Final Instructions"

Fatui operational orders that you obtained from Lyudochka. They detail an operation that will take place in the future on Watatsumi Island. This intelligence is very important â€” peoples' lives are at stake here!

## Bag of Clothes

A bag that contains Lyudochka's Fatui uniform. Considering the controversial nature of Fatui uniforms, it is best not to let other people see this.

## Special Fortune Slip

A specially made fortune slip that describes how your luck will be like today. There is nothing different about this Fortune Slip, save for the fact that you got it for the fake Bamboo Slip.
Whose fortune does this Fortune Slip describe?

## Strange Object

A strange item that you fished up from the underground waterways in The Chasm. It's wet, and you cannot tell if this is a living or dead thing.

## Bedrock Key Location Diagram

A simple diagram that Zhiqiong drew in haste. It indicates the general locations of several Bedrock Keys.

## Light Mora Purse

A Mora purse you found in a treasure chest. The feeling you had when weighing it was one of immense disappointment.

## Full Mora Purse

A Mora purse you found in a treasure chest. Compared to the previous purse you found, this one provides a decent amount more comfort.

## Plump Fish

A fish you just obtained from the river. It might be considered a gift from nature. It is so excellent that it only needs to be grilled a little to be delicious as can be.

## Beautifully-Written Note

Beautifully-Written Note

## Yun Jin's Personal Letter

A letter that Yun Jin personally wrote to Shiyun. It seems to hold the key to turning the situation around.

## Lyudochka's Letter

The letter that Lyudochka asked someone from Yae Publishing House to pass on to you. It contains her reasons for leaving without saying why. However, whether you will accept her reasons for departing or not is a different story.
It was you who discovered her presence and changed her fate... Might you be able to do still more to change this ending for the better?

## Lyudochka's Mora Purse

The Mora purse that Lyudochka left behind. It contains a decent sum of Mora, but even Paimon doesn't want to use it.

## Fatui Code Sheet

A certain ever-somnolent member of the Shuumatsuban wrote this Fatui Code Sheet.
Reading it does not merely let you know that "these Fatui speak very oddly indeed" â€” you can also feel the recorder's intense lethargy penetrating the paper in the form of saliva.

## Light Purse

A purse you got from Mona. It contains the amount she needs to pay her rent.

## Marjorie's Gift

A present that you got from Marjorie. You've heard that children will like it...

Now, this Fortune Slip has returned to your hands, along with her heartfelt blessings. If you've got the time, why not go to the Grand Narukami Shrine to see her?

## The Serpent and Drakes of Tokoyokoku

A novel based on Watatsumi Island's folktales. The original edition of this text was transcribed on Watatsumi Island and brought back to Narukami Island by a merchant while the former's serpent god yet lived. No one reads this ancient tome nowadays, its role supplanted by all the light novels on the market. This book describes the unique cosmological outlook of the Watatsumi people before they came to adopt aspects of Narukami culture, and a recent resurgence in traditional novel publishing has allowed it to see the light of day once more.

## Before Sun and Moon

A chronicle that ordinary folk have been forbidden to read. The writing is a mix of fables and histories from the beginning of the world to the creation of the Dainichi Mikoshi.

## Hydrological Studies in Byakuyakoku

This text records the geography and hydrology of Byakuyakoku. With the sealing of the depths and the emigration of the people of Watatsumi, as well as the passing of long years, this book is now useless.

## Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records

Experimental Records of the Bathysmal Vishaps. No vishaps were killed in the writing of these records.

## In the Light, Beneath the Shadow

A puzzle book for children of ages nine to twelve. As a book from a transitory period, it uses Narukami-style names with Byakuyakoku subscripts.

## The Miraculous Adventures of the Traveler

"This is a rather orthodox light novel, with its contents essentially being an edited version of real life in Teyvat. What is surprising, however, is that the author seems to be highly knowledgeable about Watatsumi Island, with many vivid, almost lifelike descriptions." â€” Ms. Hina

## The Miraculous Adventures of the Traveler

"This light novel is based on school life and depicts the antics of all manner of schoolyard oddballs. A very entertaining read." â€” Ms. Hina

## The Miraculous Adventures of the Traveler

"This story is quite wild and can be almost disorienting to read initially, but its wonderment grows on you, and it contains many a moment of gut-busting laughter. I liked it very much." â€” Ms. Hina

## The Miraculous Adventures of the Traveler

"By blending many styles together, this seemingly thin book transports you into a great many tales. I can only imagine that its author must also be a very interesting person. I happen to know someone like that, in fact â€” something that lends this book a very familiar touch." â€” Ms. Hina

## Muning's Note

The Ministry representative Muning gave you this note. Despite its short length, the word "prohibited" appears 8 times. If you give this to an adventurer named Zhiqiong, you will receive the aid you need.

## Frostglaze Crystal

A glaze crystal produced in the depths of The Chasm, this special Glaze Sand Crystal ore was one of many scattered about during the battle against the giant ruin machine. Glaze Sand Crystal ore is a regional specialty of The Chasm, but this one is different from the rest.
Under the radiance of the blue crystal and the power of the Abyss, a strange spiral pattern has emerged within this stone, and it is cold, almost chilling to the touch.
This once smooth crystal has been transformed into this shape by the great might that descended from the heavens and the miasma that arose from the earth's depths â€” and perhaps the form it has taken is itself a warning unto mortals.
If the interaction of these forces alone could twist stone and metal thus, if that ordinary heroine was truly able to witness the end of the pitch-dark path, how would she have faced the discovery she would make?

## Bloodied Sergeant's Insignia

The bloodied and muddied insignia of a Fatui sergeant. You have no idea how it ended up in the depths of The Chasm.

## Corporal Nikolay's Diary

A letter left behind by Corporal Nikolay. Its contents have long ceased to be whole.

## Corporal Nikolay's Diary

A fragment of Fatui Corporal Nikolay's diary. It gives off a rather unpleasant smell, but that's at least better than being covered in mud.

## Mora Purse

You were asked by Xu from Feiyun Commerce Guild to deliver this to Huishan Hall's representative Muning, who is at The Chasm. It contains a rather sizable sum of Mora.

## A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits

A light novel that has been popular in Inazuma lately. It contains all manner of bizarre tales involving ancient youkai.

## Dream Sakura

You held a single sakura petal in your hand before leaving Raiden Makoto's realm of consciousness.
Its existence is a mystery. It appears no different from ordinary sakura petals, and there it silently sits in your storage just like any of the others. But you can no longer touch it, nor can you feel its weight or warmth. When an object loses any of the attributes that one would normally ascribe to it, how can its "existence" be proven for sure?
As you think back on the many sights the petal must have witnessed in the past, a certain guess comes to mind: that which sustains this sakura petal's existence must be someone's will. But as to who this person is, and whether they are intentionally or unintentionally keeping this petal in existence, neither can be known. Nor can you prove whether that willpower is one derived from yearning, trust, or gratitude.
Perhaps, when "that person's will" changes, so too will this sakura petal disappear.
Just to be safe, it might be best to check back from time to time and see if it still exists.

## Aphotium Ore

A special ore created due to the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri. As Enkanomiya's environment has undergone extreme changes, the memories and thoughts of Watatsumi Omikami scattered throughout Enkanomiya have coalesced into medullae, which then transformed into ore.

## Tokoyo Legume

A special plant that was produced via the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri. With the awakening of the Sangacorexes, the elemental energies within Enkanomiya have been pacified. This is a naturally-growing fertilizing crop that will turn into loam within the soil once it decays.

## Husk Gem

A jewel that fell from the armor of a special Shadowy Husk after you defeated it. You can feel a will surging within it. Perhaps it might be more correct to say that this will manifested itself through the armor rather than manipulated it.

## Fragmented Accessory

A small accessory you got from Kokomi. It seems to be the fragment of another object. According to her, it might come in handy at some point.

## Fragmented Accessory

A fragment that you got from "Enjou." He stole this from the Dainichi Mikoshi, so this should be a relic of Enkanomiya.

## Tsumi's Map

A map drawn by Tsumi. There are some markings on it.

## Hakuen Michimitsu Amenoma

The heirloom blade of the Iwakura Clan.
Although the one who forged this blade possessed great skills, and though it is true that this sword has slain many a foe, it does not possess any special powers. Nor has the Iwakura Succession ever obtained a Vision. Their excellent swordsmanship was purely a result of their honing of mind, body, and technique.
This blade has been submerged in water for a long time and seems to have completely rusted.

## Wooden Cage Key

Someone from the Kanjou Commission left this behind. You should be able to use this to rescue Shinnojou.

## Damaged Stone Slate

A seemingly ordinary stone slate. Who knows what secrets it might hold...

## Mysterious Stone Slate

The final stone slate you obtained. Secrets within secrets, eh?

## Yanbo's Note

A somewhat complete note, written in a neat hand. It seems to have been a letter left for an old friend.

## Nikolay's Letter

A letter you found off one of the Black Serpent Knights. The name of the letter's recipient is neatly written: "Katarina Snezhevna, My Dear Elder Sister," while the sender's name is written somewhat haphazardly, though you can make out the words "Your Brother, Nikolay Snezhevich."

## The Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival!

This is a most lavish invitation letter, whether in its construction or its content. The letter describes a large-scale, deep-rooted, nationally-acclaimed event in which you shall be a most important guest, the radiant star of the show.

## Worksite Records

This was originally a ledger, but appears to have been re-purposed as a site log instead. The latest daily happenings at The Chasm have been scribbled into its pages, though not much of this information is of any particular use.

## Five Kasen Summary

A summary of the information concerning the Five Kasen, which you got from Yae Publishing House's Hirayama.
Although the content is quite sparse, you can still get the gist of the Five Kasen and the great flair they had in their heyday.

## The Five Kasen's Splendor: Suikou

A sheet of paper Venti found in a cargo crate within the wharf warehouse. A poem entitled "The Five Kasen's Splendor: Suikou" is written upon it.

## The Five Kasen's Splendor: Aoi no Okina

A sheet of paper Xingqiu found beneath his luggage. Someone seems to have left it there while he was napping. A poem entitled "The Five Kasen's Splendor: Aoi no Okina" is written upon it.

## The Five Kasen's Splendor: Akahito

A sheet of paper that some mysterious person left behind. This person must have originally intended to leave it on Kazuha's person, only to be unexpectedly detected by the latter and forced to flee in a hurry, leaving the sheet behind. A poem entitled "The Five Kasen's Splendor: Akahito" is written upon it.

## The Five Kasen's Splendor: Sumizome

Ayaka found this on a flower stand at the festival venue. This sheet of paper, however, only contains one line of text.

## The Five Kasen's Splendor: Sumizome

Ayaka found this on a flower stand at the festival venue. Once submerged in water, this sheet of paper reveals the full poetic text of "The Five Kasen's Splendor: Sumizome."

## Ancient Forging Blueprint

An ancient forging blueprint. The Shogun once ordered the Kaedehara Clan to forge a Goshintou according to it.
After being soaked in water, it becomes clear that some of the text has been blurred â€” someone tampered with the blueprint, dooming the forging to failure and triggering the tragedy that followed...

## Kaedehara Yoshinori's Letter

A blank piece of paper that was hidden in an old flower pot. When dipped in water, it reveals a long-sealed secret.
After telling everyone about the truth that was concealed within, Kazuha said that "this letter may still be of use to you," before handing it over to you.

## Taliesin's Manuscript

A very thick poetic manuscript. If you were to give it a generous review, it would be "mediocre," while an honest review would see it getting a "hard to read." It resembles bone-dry historical records more than it does poetry.

The gift that Gorou got when helping Kokomi purchase books during the Irodori Festival. Gorou then gave it to you as thanks for accompanying him.
Every time you look at it, you can't help but remember the sight of every hair on Gorou's body standing on end as he heard the word "fox."

It is said that opening this will bring you bad luck. It seems lighter than you assumed it might be...?

A popular light novel in Inazuma which tells the story of the "good-for-nothing" Shogun and the "good-at-everything" Kitsune Guuji. The novel is in the same collection as "Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden With Unlimited Power," but not by the same author. What they share in common, however, is their popularity.

## Bag of Ornaments

A bag of decorations that Old Chou gave you as compensation for Tang Wuchou's misfortunes. They are very roughly made, owing to having been manufactured by the Treasure Hoarders within The Chasm using smuggled ore, and can barely be considered to possess any aesthetic qualities at all. As such, there is no hope at all of them selling well in Liyue. The only thing good you could say about these ornaments is that they are at least made using the right materials...

## Vasmrti

An item you obtained after traversing the nursery. It is translucent and seems to contain the memories of the earth.

## Garland

A garland woven by Arama.
Garlands of this kind represent the blessings from all of Vanarana and once channeled endless powers during the fight with Marana's Avatar. But their blazing light has now faded, perhaps because they burned so relentlessly.

Every flower on the garland is connected with the lovely, tiny heart of an Aranara, and all of them together constitute the gate to Mahavanaranapna. Aranara will support those who wear such garlands. As friends, they ease the wearers' pains, ward off their nightmares, aid them through lightless days, and fill the emptiness in their hearts.

For Arakara, who nurtures Viparyas, flowers given to friends must be most precious indeed.

## The Siblings' Flowers

Flowers gifted by Arapacati and her brothers.
Longing to be connected as "siblings" are, these Aranara have each taken on the role of sister or brother. Their obsession with cooking stems from the wish to share food with family.
That being said, an Aranara's tastebuds are not to be trusted.

## The Song Gatherers' Flowers

Flowers gifted to you by the Song Gatherers.
"No matter how dark the sky and land get, as long as your spirit emits warm, golden light like the sun, there will always be hope."

That's what Frozen Soul said.

## Remelting Device

This device, developed by alchemist Hajanad, is cleverly designed with an internal chamber capable of withstanding high pressure and high temperature to withstand the explosion from the "remelting effect". The special valve can be opened automatically at the right time to release the fully mixed medicament smoke and provide the user with assistance in combat.

## Remelting Tablet

A masterpiece of the alchemist Hajanad, a truly special solid potion. Theoretically, this alchemy tablet can be stored for a long time and is quite safe and easy to carry and transport.

And it is always a little disturbing to think that the device in hand may explode...

## Sacred Seal: Precipice

A stone plate with ancient text on it that seems to have once been part of a certain building. The desert sands play host to many an unknown wish. Who made them, and who carries them now? Some claimed that it bears the form of a zither from a bygone and ancient nation, yet the symbol seemed to be related to descriptions of dangerous situations.

## Silver Twig

A new branch taken from the center of the world.
There was once a giant tree that ran across the world, and this twig was part of it. Though it has been removed from the tree, their connection remains strong as ever. Therefore, as long as the giant white tree that symbolizes the center of the world does not die, it will never wither.

"Trees" symbolize life. In one of the stories from a certain place, there was a person who had entrusted her consciousness to the white tree's branches before she passed away. In that way, neither her life nor hope would be lost, since the branches would grow and sprout where there was sunshine and rain, and would one day blossom and bear fruits.
"Trees" also symbolize wisdom. In one of the legends, a sage hanging upside down on a tree had acquired the knowledge of how to inscribe runes and control sacred words, and thus followed the kingdom established along the tree's roots, eventually gaining a glimpse of the secret of the cosmos.
All knowledge, memory, and experience flow through this giant tree, just like a stream flows into a river, the river joins a sea, the sea turns into clouds, and the clouds rain onto the ground â€” just like life itself.

## Layla's List of Orders

This is a list containing the items Layla ordered from the Almighty Merchant. The cooking ingredients that Layla was looking to purchase are written down here.
The list mentions the address where she first met up with the Almighty Merchant and the names of the items that Layla was sold. Special mention is made of Layla's purchase of an item "that has never been found anywhere in the Grand Bazaar," as if to prevent the other party from forgetting Layla's identity. But for some reason, the meeting address was not in Sumeru City, but instead on a road outside the city. This Almighty Merchant character seems most adept at scheduling, to have accepted Layla's order while still transporting their goods.

## Initial Investigation Clues

Clues that you gathered from the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament's Floral Jelly booth while no one was around â€” you took some photos of Floral Jelly and the Floral Jelly recipe.

Old notes left by Haniyyah that seem to be about her family.

## Special Wisdom Orb

If you look closely, you can even find the following words: "Backdoor command application sample" and "Confirmed to have no value, may be discarded," as well as some blood. It seems that not only did someone snatch this, but that they might have met with some misfortune afterward...

## Mysterious Fatui Letter

A letter you found after defeating a Fatui Agent you came across. Why would he carry this with him, though?

The "Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King" claims that as long as you show this voucher to the stall, you can "enjoy a free bowl of ramen for two months straight!" But... which stall is "the stall" exactly?

Among its key ingredients are Nascent Bamboo Shoots. They're hard to come by... And due to a multiplicity of reasons, their commemorative value far exceeds their worth as cooking ingredients. Since this meal was created by an adeptus, it shouldn't spoil even if you just leave it in your bag.

## Schematic Clipped Inside Notes

The sketches taken from the mysterious investigative notes seem to list the structural layout of the ruined underground proving grounds and the location of the Great Song of Khvarena...

## Rene's Investigation Notes

Supposedly, these notes were left by a great researcher who yearned to "surpass mortality," and its contents detail his experiences exploring ruins, along with the knowledge he gained in the process...

## Notes Left by Someone

This appears to be notes left by a member of the Order of Skeptics. It has information on the lost Kory Drums and their traditional usage.

## Ancient Volume

## "Returning Curios" Memento (I)

A memento discovered at a treasure site in the Veluriyam Mirage event, "Returning Curios." The treasure chest that contains it corresponds to the first code â€” "A sweet mist permeates all, gazing toward the dancing lamplight, I almost forget to breathe. In the end, memories of childhood guide me, and I take my seat beside the table in peace..."

## "Returning Curios" Memento (II)

A memento discovered at a treasure site in the Veluriyam Mirage event, "Returning Curios." The treasure chest that contains it corresponds to the second code â€” "A shooting star of vines carries me, traversing a forest so quiet and peaceful, to finally arrive in secluded dreamland so pure."

## "Returning Curios" Memento (III)

A memento discovered at a treasure site in the Veluriyam Mirage event, "Returning Curios." The treasure chest that contains it corresponds to the third code â€” "A blue, spotless ceiling, a floor of white candy, soft companions surround me, I too have wings!"

## Memento Collection Box

A special box you got from Idyia that is used to contain "Returning Curios" mementos. It is said that it can protect the items within for a long time. With this box, you can pick a special memento and treasure site to leave your very own mark on the Veluriyam Mirage...

## Mysterious Mora Pocketwatch

A Mora-shaped (and Mora-shiny) pocketwatch you accidentally found in the Veluriyam Mirage. This one bears a strong resemblance to a Mora pocketwatch left behind by a seasoned adventurer in the earliest days of "Returning Curios." One wonders how much it is worth.
However, Idyia also says that "it's not about the value of the treasure or the watch, but the stories hidden inside the treasures!" Perhaps using monetary value as the measure of this memento is not the most fitting...

## In Pursuit of the Lost Inscription

A note obtained from Sosi. It might contain clues about the lost monument fragments.

## Haniyyah's Gift of Marvelous Jellies

An exquisite gift offered by Haniyyah. It contains Marvelous Jellies much loved by the Fungi, and the Jellies themselves come in many unique flavors that can be fed to the Fungi based on their individual preferences.
The Marvelous Jellies are a refined version of the Floral Jellies that preceded them and retain their crystalline translucence and springy texture, sans the dangerous ingredients, thus making them the ideal feed for Fungi. That said, one should probably take care that the children don't eat it by mistake when storing it at home...

## Old Gear

It seems to be a part of a huge machine, but this lone gear that fell out may not be of any use. However, if the way to make it turn again is found, then perhaps the answers to some questions may in turn be discovered.

## Mountaineering Rope

Mountaineering rope favored by adventurers. It's a bit old but well-maintained, so it can still be used as per normal. This rope was left here as a gift. Perhaps it is not just ropes that a person relies on when scaling great heights, but friendly hands that reach out to you.

## Familiar-Looking Candy Box

A candy box that is often used in various celebrations in Sumeru. When the girl who would become a researcher was still young, she used to take one candy a day from the box. Back in those days, her biggest worry was that the candy would run out. After becoming a researcher, this empty candy box has become a nostalgic reminder of other possibilities in life. This candy box was left here as a gift. To the researcher, this is also a symbol of freedom from misery.

## Travel Lamp

A lamp that the boy often used when studying at night. The flame can be adjusted via a mechanism in the lamp, and this was perhaps quite magical to a child who had never seen such a lamp before. Every time he saw the light from this lamp, he will think of the old days when he played various hand shadow characters and animals. This lamp was left here as a gift. Maybe this is a way for him to let go of his burden and move on.

## Box of Special Potions

You have no idea why it ended up here, but beautiful metal products like this are loved by Melusines...

## Key to the Castle's Secret Chamber

An item that is key to the "Petrifying Gaze" scenario in Daiya's Three-Day Reverie, which can be used to open a secret chamber that conceals an ancient medicine. Its outer appearance is not much different from that of ordinary keys.

## Ancient Hex-Cleansing Remedy

An item that is key to the "Petrifying Gaze" scenario in Daiya's Three-Day Reverie.
According to the Lone Hydro Eidolon, such remedies have the power to cleanse Wraith-cast hexes and restore petrified Hydro Eidolons to their original states.
However, the outward appearance of the remedy indicates the use of a very common alchemy vessel. Is this narrative setting related to alchemy, or is the theater troupe just cutting costs...?

## "The Great Escape" Prop Book

## "Active Odor Imitating Bait"

A new fishing aid developed by Delaroche that applies the principles of odor analysis and advanced bait mimicry. It is said that its effect is "very powerful." You can tell by the appearance that Delaroche thinks the world of this bait, with protective wrapping and a special bag. However, it is unknown whether such meticulous measures will affect the basic function of the bait â€” even if it attracts fish, the fish themselves may be unable to even find a way to bite down upon it.

## Left-Side Table File Box

A file box that ruthlessly attacked Ms. Chalmet's back. It was placed on the table on the left-hand side of the entrance. It would probably be easier to move if it was placed inside a bag...

## Full Pankration Fonta Cup

The trophy for the Pankration recreational tournament, filled completely with Fonta.
Even after being set down, a bubbling sound can be heard, a bit like the sound of "hot oil and juices in a pot of meat," making anyone who hears it hanker for food.
However, the size of the trophy is in a category all its own, and few could swallow the contents in a single swig. Even if you forced yourself to manage the feat, you'd probably bloat up like a Blubberbeast and might even end up hospitalized...

## Experimental Drink No. 1

An "experimental drink" created by Heinry. It is filled with fizzy bubbles, and has a slightly salty flavor...
But overall, it still maintains a bit of the orginal Fonta flavor... at least you know what you are drinking is still Fonta.

## Experimental Drink No. 2

An "experimental drink" created by Heinry. It is filled with fizzy bubbles, and you can even taste a bit of a slightly salty tea flavor?
This drink feels more like a bottle of "Salty Carbonated Tea," and not Fonta.

## Experimental Drink No. 3

An "experimental drink" created by Heinry. This Fonta has no bubbles whatsoever, and the saltiness is quite prominent.
At the very least, it still counts as Fonta.

## Experimental Drink No. 4

An "experimental drink" created by Heinry. It has no bubbles whatsoever, and is a bit like slightly salty tea.
Okay, it's basically like a plain old bottle of tea.

## Experimental Drink No. 5

An "experimental drink" created by Heinry. Refreshing Fonta, a font of refreshment! Classic Fonta, aha!
Uh... but just making a bottle of classic Fonta is pretty meaningless.

## Experimental Drink No. 6

An "experimental drink" created by Heinry. A "sweet bubbly tea" bursting with bubbles. It tastes... not all that bad?

## Experimental Drink No. 7

An "experimental drink" created by Heinry. Refreshing Fonta, a font ofâ€” what!? This bottle's gone flat, who took off the cap and didn't finish drinking it!?

## Experimental Drink No. 8

An "experimental drink" created by Heinry. A "sweet bubbly tea" completely bereft of bubbles. Can... Can I just have a cup of tea instead?

## Arataki Gang's Instant Ramen

A gift from Kuki Shinobu after helping the Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King power up and find new ways in Beetle Battle in Arataki Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp. 
Dried ramen blocks are placed in a sturdy yet light box, with sealed condiments, exceptionally rigid utensils, and a bowl. Put the ramen and the condiments in the bowl, then pour in hot water to quickly make a bowl of ramen that doesn't taste too bad at all. Convenient, isn't it? 
But according to the letter that Kuki Shinobu left in the box, neither she nor Arataki Itto got to eat this during their journey on the water to Liyue, because they only brought cookies and pickles. During their stay in Liyue, Kuki Shinobu was inspired by the wheaten foods there, and created this instant ramen so that Oni King's Right Hand and Skycleaving White-Iron Lavender Melon could fight off their hunger during their travels...

It appears to use some hard-to-grasp imaging techniques in conjunction with the sand table device from the "Thousand-Pace Interdiction Arcminute Sharpshooting Zone" to simulate using a musket to shoot at one's foes.
Though this is considered in many ways insufficient for actual Patrol members' training regimens, it is more than enough to drum up interest in muskets and musketry, in developing one's talents for such, and for using such gifts for good.

It once held the authority to command all devices within Ochkanatlan, the ineffable city, yet can no longer be used due to its energy having been completely exhausted.
Just as with the half-humans who pursued it so relentlessly, the Dragonlord's quest for perfection was ultimately in vain, leading to naught but an end that was as cold and lifeless as jade.

## The Little Witch and the Undying Fire (I)

The binding and layout are exquisitely made, but the actual content is all handwritten. Judging from the handwriting, there is more than one author. "Don't fuss about WHAT we're writing, the cover needs to look good! That's the only way it'll give off that 'masterpiece' feeling."

## The Little Witch and the Undying Fire (II)

"You're more than halfway through and you haven't even pushed the plot forward one iota! Why is it all about the setting!?" "And what would you know? Besides, this stuff isn't fleshing the setting out. It's elucidating natural science and other miscellaneous disciplines!"

## The Little Witch and the Undying Fire (III)

## The Feline Firm (V)

A cat's magical boots and a cat's mysterious mask. Just how will they bring the long-furred cat to the Feline Firm?

## The Feline Firm (VI)

Witnessed by all the cats and the Master, will the tabby cat and the long-furred cat get hitched without a hitch, becoming cat husband-and-wife... or...?

## Green Berryshroom

An ordinary-looking mushroom with an extraordinary flavor. Only grows near the orchard at Varesa's house. They're fast growers, so if you see one, eat it quickly.

## Permit to the Sacred Heart

An unadorned scale obtained from the Chamber of Deliberation and activated by the Secret Source Servant, Awanyu. It grants access to the Heart of the Sacred Mountain. Most dragon scales discolor and fade to white once removed from their masters as they lose the power that once ran through them. Yet this one, despite its long history, still glows gold in the darkness, displaying its might for all to see.

## Phlogiston Unit

A replaceable resource unit created by the ancient inhabitants of this place by harnessing the properties of Phlogiston. All Secret Source Automatons require Phlogiston Units to work, though the exact specifications of the units required depend on the complexity of each automaton's operations.

## Fusion Profusion: DJ Remix Selections

A series of songs handpicked by Xilonen that have earned her recognition, a selection truly unique to Natlan. Includes a "Master Xilonen Commemorative Photo" commissioned by several DJs. 
However, it seems that this record can only sound its best on professional equipment such as the Dance-Off Stage, and using unsuitable equipment may damage the disc surface... In any case, it makes for a one-of-a-kind collector's item and keepsake!

## Tears Among the Stars

A drop of water obtained from within the colossal beast who coveted the primordial sea of life.

A philosopher in the faraway ancient world once posited that where there is life, there is death; naturally where there is death, there is life.
If not, then the fleeting light cannot resist the eternal darkness, and all withers into nothingness at the end of time.
The rules among the stars dictate that nature must be conserved, but the laws of the universe have never been conserved.
In a sealed box, destruction always overpowers new life. Millennia upon millennia of prosperity are but an instant in a span of billions of years. The greatest of achievements, the proudest accomplishments, in time all will tarnish, decay, dissipate, and ultimately fade into oblivion.
Thus there are things floating in among the stars, once adorned with countless prestigious titles from innumerable civilizations, shedding tears for their ordained demise.
Their tears stream down, out of desperation, out of hope, because all desperation and hope alike will be utterly extinguished along with the innumerable stars.
Their tears stream down out of sorrow, out of joy, because both will eventually scatter into the cold, dark endless void.
Every tiny yet beautiful silhouette and every moment worth remembering will fade with time, even stars.
And then there are these so-called "gods" that are determined to save everything worth saving, and devour everything that should be devoured.
Until the end of time, until the sea of stars recess into nothing but dying embers, until a newborn "world" moves for the first time in the stomach of the whale.
"There will be no more sins, no more sadness, and no more tears, because everything died with the ancient stars."

## Obsidian Ancient Name

An Ancient Name, Tumaini, forged after many twists and turns, whose meaning is "hope."
You are its first bearer, and it shall record all your deeds and adventures in Natlan, to be passed down forevermore.
"Wisdom" is not the sole domain of living things, nor are all memories or emotions a "blessing." It is a nameless, shapeless existence, nor can common sense comprehend it. Just as we know naught about places that no light may touch, we cannot be sure that there are not countless pairs of eyes watching us from the deepest reaches of the dark. It is a condescending thing that lusts after the knowledge and information stored in the land. Even the horror and despair, which humans can never transcend, are mere emotions "simulated" for your benefit once it has understood all that Natlan is.
Lend your ear to Xumucul's roar. Hear the hatred that festered in the heart of the unrivaled warrior a thousand years ago. How he regrets lifting his weapon before the tombs of his companions in days bygone! For if this battle could never have been won, then he was no leader, but a cruel, lonesome king.
Look upon the tears of Cochanina â€” witness her thousand-year-old despair. Resolute she was to the end, but fire, sword, and death never ceased to ravage her homeland. At the last, she would kneel before the icy coffins, and reflect upon the image the rain-puddles painted of her: If it cannot be rejected, why not embrace it?
Feel Ndenge's fury, and know his thousand-year madness. He fought for Natlan all his life, shed and spent his fiery blood, only to learn the truth of war from the Sacred Flame once he had attained the throne. He was not a hero, beloved by all â€” he was but a blind, ignorant clown, for humanity can never hope to conquer the true master.
Fathom the words of Xbalanque, perceive his thousand-year-old lie. The utmost wisdom births the utmost paranoia, and as he held time and death in his hands, he doomed Natlan to an endgame without any solution. Humans need not light lamps before the destined darkness to come, lest it be to attract still larger monsters.
Think upon Mavuika's plan... No.
It can warp history and memory, but it cannot twist your personal experiences. This is the meaning of this name you hold, and the light that Ancient Names mean to pass down.
"Our forebears carved 'miracles' into obsidian rock, yet future bearers looked upon them and saw 'strength.'"
