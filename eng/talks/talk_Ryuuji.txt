Traveler: Ryuuji?
Owada: Ryuuji is from the Bantan Sango Detective Agency, and he's an old acquaintance of mine.
Owada: Back when he was the victim of a frame job, I wanted to do something, but sadly, my power was limited...
Owada: Luckily, he met the president of that detective agency, who helped to clear his name.
Owada: Anyway, it's best that we don't see another case like that one... or any cases at all. Yeah.
