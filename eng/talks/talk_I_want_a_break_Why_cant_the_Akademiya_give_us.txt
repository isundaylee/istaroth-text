Arina: I want a break... Why can't the Akademiya give us some time off during the Extravaganza?
Armin: Don't you enjoy watching the competition?
Arina: No, I do but... If you think about it, we can only watch the competitions if we have a break, right?
Armin: Yeah, that makes sense... Though, watching all my senior classmates represent their Darshans has inadvertently inspired a new drive in me to study!
Armin: I've made up my mind. In the future, I'm going to enter the Interdarshan Championship too!
Arina: Huh... It's a bit early to be thinking about this, isn't it? Didn't our instructors say that seeking knowledge should be a steady and serious endeavor?
Arina: Maybe before considering partaking in a competition that happens once in a blue moon, maybe you should consider which Darshan you want to join first?
