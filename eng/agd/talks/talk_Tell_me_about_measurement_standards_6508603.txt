Traveler: Tell me about measurement standards...
Eunomia: Well, that's the focus of my work.
Eunomia: As you know, people who live in different regions have different habits when taking measurements.
Eunomia: The people in the eastern part of the city say that a length of rope is a quarter-meter long, and people in the west will ask "and how much is that, exactly?"
Eunomia: My job is to match these things that don't fit together and come up with a common name for them, for example, "Mermonia Meters," or something of the order.
Eunomia: That was just an example, by the way. Please don't take it too seriously.
