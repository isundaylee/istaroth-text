# Missing title (1848509455)

Traveler: I don't know...
Vasco: I understand. When you embark on an adventure, you can come across a variety of situations anywhere you go. And rainforests and deserts are infested with quite some strange things.
Vasco: But I'm not going to sea again anytime soon. I'll just wait and see.
Vasco: This bow is of little use to me now. Do you wish to take it?
Vasco: I thought ranged weapons like this might be useful at sea or on a deserted island, or even for bowfishing.
Vasco: Now that I think about it... Nah. Perhaps I should take it one step at a time and learn to use a dagger first.
