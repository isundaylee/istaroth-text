# Collei's Windblume

To Collei, the only flower that can serve as her Windblume and convey her gratitude and well-wishes is the Padisarah. She now offers their seeds to you.
In visiting Mondstadt again, Collei has taken a tentative step toward the future. May her coming days be as a small seed held within her palm, filled deep with the potential for light and hope.
