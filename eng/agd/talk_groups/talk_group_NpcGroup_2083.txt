Ying'er: Oh my~ If it isn't my old acquaintance. Did you come all this way during Lantern Rite to see me?
Ying'er: Of course, you look as lovely as ever.
Ying'er: It's just a shame that we're so busy, even though it's the festival period...
Ying'er: But either way, why don't you feast your eyes on what we've got in store? Who knows, you might chance upon some extra benefits.
Ying'er: I mean, I'm just a slap of lipstick and a dab of makeup compared to these beauties.

Traveler: Wait, is this a...
Ying'er: Of course! As you would expect. The real deal.
Ying'er: You didn't know? They let us open our own little hideaways, nothing to worry about.
Ying'er: Just imagine, the warmth of their bodies, the smoothness of their curves under your hands...
Ying'er: Pretty as they are, you can't have them out and about, it's not appropriate. I have to get them baked for twelve hours before I can even open shop...
Traveler: Wait, did you just say "baked"?
Ying'er: Of course! I mean, not as intensely as those other places, but once I've got them ready, they're just as good as anywhere else.
Ying'er: All our very best are as I described; full and elegant bodies, thinner up top, but curvaceous further down. It's what everybody is asking for these days...
Ying'er: The clients that I have come and pick their favorite and then off they go! They're always so glowing and satisfied when they're done.
