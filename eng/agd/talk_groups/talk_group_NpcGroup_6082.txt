Traveler: Mind telling me about your tribe?
Avilix: The Children of Echoes? Ah, this is the tribe right here.
Avilix: Pretty cozy, right? This is the home where we grew up. We've always been surrounded by music, dance, and incredibly chubby Tepetlisaurs.
Avilix: The only problem is that we've dug too deep into the mountains, so sometimes, it's hard to get a good amount of sun. But that's fine — the people here are rowdy enough that you'll never feel lonely.

Traveler: Tell me about "rocks"...
Avilix: The Tepetlisaurs are great at digging, so by living alongside them, we're basically living alongside rocks and ore.
Avilix: Oh, and besides those, we've also got solid phlogiston! You know what phlogiston is, right? You're already been here a while, after all.
Avilix: That's especially true for the Children of Echoes. Gems are really important to us — we see them almost like a second layer of our skin.
Avilix: If you want to live and work in Natlan, know this: the more gems someone is wearing, the harder they are to deal with.

Traveler: About the aftermath of the war...
Avilix: Ah, thank you for your concern. The reconstruction work is progressing at a steady pace, and our stockpile of gemstones and equipment is finally being put to good use.
Avilix: Some of our warriors were injured, while others are now gone... It is a great pity. You may notice that some familiar faces in Natlan are no longer to be seen.
Avilix: But you needn't look sad. They fought for the glory of Natlan, and their sacrifice was not in vain.

Traveler: Looks like I'll have to go get some.
Avilix: Haha, don't you worry. We're not the type to look down on anyone who doesn't come bedecked in gems.
Avilix: Here, take this. This is a Crystal Fruit common to these parts — hope it brings you good luck.
