Neuvillette: This bears a striking resemblance to the Fountain of Lucine. Sadly, the water here comes from a different source, so there is, of course, no way to replicate the taste.
Neuvillette: Nevertheless, prior experience tells me that to most people, the visual similarity alone would be enough to prompt them to say a phrase such as: "This area has a very Fountain of Lucine flavor."
Neuvillette: ...My cup is empty. May I avail myself of your fountain?
