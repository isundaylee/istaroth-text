Zhen Qiang: That should just about do it. What hard work.
Traveler: What's up with those stairs over there?
Zhen Qiang: The stairs? Oh, you want to go up to the inn?
Zhen Qiang: You've come at a bad time, there's two big holes on the way up. To prevent people from missing their step, the boss has had the whole stairway closed.
Zhen Qiang: The preparations for repairs have been made, but the stairs won't be fit for walking for a while.
Zhen Qiang: Don't worry. You can't use the stairs, but the elevator over there is just fine.
Zhen Qiang: It can move cargo, so carrying people isn't a problem. If you're in a rush, how about using that instead?
Zhen Qiang: Oh yeah, and while you're at it, help me give this to the boss. It's a gift from a guest.
Traveler: Got it.
Zhen Qiang: Well, off you go, then. Remember to watch your footing. This inn is pretty high up, so falling off halfway is no joke!
Traveler: Why aren't you going up yourself?
Zhen Qiang: I need to stay down here to receive goods. There's lot of goods to receive, and I daren't make any mistakes.
Zhen Qiang: Alright, off you get. Watch your footing, now. This inn is pretty high up, and falling off halfway is no joke!

Traveler: What are you doing?
Zhen Qiang: Not much. I'm just watching this crane on orders from my boss.
Zhen Qiang: Truth be told, there isn't all that much to do. I mean, what's this crane supposed to do, grow legs and run off?
Traveler: What does this crane do, anyway?
Zhen Qiang: Hey, don't touch it however you like. This contraption isn't something an outsider can use. We boatmen rely on this to help us transport cargo.
Zhen Qiang: And our boss has said that if anything goes wrong with that crane, our heads will be bolted to it, and...
Zhen Qiang: ...Well, whatever you do, just don't touch it.
