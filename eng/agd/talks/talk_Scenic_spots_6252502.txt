Traveler: Scenic spots?
Wanjing: Are you a tourist, too?
Wanjing: Judging from your calm demeanor, you must be one of those "been there, done that" experts who has been just about everywhere, right?
Wanjing: I haven't really gotten around that much myself. I tend to stop pretty frequently while traveling, so at best I've only seen a few of Chenyu Vale's most famous sights.
Wanjing: Yilong Dais is my final stop on this trip. I've heard that burning incense in that censer outside the mountain is super lucky!
Wanjing: But I'm pretty scared of heights, so I might need to ask someone to go there for me... I hope it won't be too expensive...?
