# The Arc of Intellect


## Talk 1

Kareena: ...Thank you all for your excellent performance. And that brings this year's Interdarshan Championship to a close!
Kareena: Finally, it gives me great pleasure to invite our champion, Kaveh, to the stage to receive his award.
Kareena: Typically, at this point, we would crown our champion with the diadem as well as presenting them with their award.
Kareena: However, we have just received word that Kaveh has inherited Sachin's estate, and made the decision to donate it all to charitable causes.
Marwa: Sachin's estate... is getting donated?
Alae: So much Mora... and he gave it all up?
Kareena: Kaveh's generosity will give many struggling families the chance to change their lives for the better.
Kareena: Of course, without the diadem and prize money to present, this makes the award ceremony a little more concise than expected. Would you like to say a few words, Kaveh? I'm sure many of our audience, like myself, are curious to learn why you decided to give all this wealth away.
Kaveh: I'm... not entirely sure what I should say under these circumstances. I'm glad to have won, even though I'd say luck played a big part in that.
Kaveh: As for why I want to give the Mora away... I don't support Sachin's views, and I don't want to take his Mora. With a lot of things in life, people need to experience them for themselves. It shouldn't be up to one person to make a judgment on — not him, and not me either.
Kaveh: Anyway, this isn't really the time and place for such weighty and complicated topics. So umm... I guess that's all. I'll leave it there, thanks very much.
Kareena: Oh, Kaveh... just one moment.
Kareena: While this is a short-and-sweet award ceremony, we do still have a prize to present you with. Please take this limited-edition Genius Invokation TCG card.
Kareena: Additionally, your champion status will be logged in your record. This means that the sages will give priority consideration to any future project proposals you submit.
Kaveh: Alright, I'll take the card. But as for project proposals... Eh, forget it.
Kareena: In that case, I declare the award ceremony over. Let's give our champion, Kaveh one last big round of applause!
Aissa: I still don't really get it. That sum of Mora would've been enough for me to live in luxury for my entire life.
Bahir: That just means you're not strange enough to understand the way that geniuses think. Come on, we've still got the whole Wisdom Gala to explore!
Kaveh: *sigh* Glad that's over. I think I'm quite good at giving speeches, but this one was just so tiring...
Paimon: Do you mean that you're still exhausted from the competition? Honestly, you don't look happy at all... But whatever else happened, you're the champion, you know? Don't you think you should be proud of that?
Kaveh: I suppose... *sigh* Oh, wait. Cyno said that he wanted the card, didn't he? And now I have it, right here!
Paimon: So you're gonna give it to him? But, if it's a rare one, you should be able to make a tidy sum of Mora off it!
Kaveh: Why would I do that? It's of no use to me whatsoever — I may as well just give it to him. Could you pass it on to him for me when you next see him?
Paimon: Whoa, whoa, this is a super big deal. You should do it yourself! Come on, let's go find Cyno!
Kaveh: Huh? But I was gonna rest for a while longer— hey, hey, stop pulling my hair!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Looks like the ceremony will be held at the main venue. Let's head over and check it out!

## Talk 3

Cyno: Kaveh, do you have plans after this?
Kaveh: I was thinking of maybe going to the Akademiya for some alone time. Nothing set in stone, though — why do you ask?

## Talk 4

Tighnari: Are you sure you have enough to cover this? Don't blow it all at once.
Kaveh: Don't worry. I budgeted very carefully, and this is well within my means. Anyway, I've lost count of how many times you've treated me. It's high time I returned the favor.
Kaveh: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, over here!
Paimon: Ooh, look at all this! Good food, here we come!
Tighnari: I heard that you went to see the other contestants. How's everyone doing?
Paimon: Faruzan found herself a student, and Layla's classmates are bowled over by how well she did. We couldn't find Hat Guy, though. Who knows where he's gone.
Kaveh: Alhaitham's gone missing in action, too. Huh. The one time I'm actually in a good enough mood to treat him to a nice meal, he disappears without a trace.
Kaveh: ...That guy... where the heck could he have gone? I still have questions about that note he left...
Kaveh: Well, whatever. He can do what he wants. Now, let's eat!
Black Screen Text: You all share a delicious meal...
Tighnari: You shocked me a little when you hurled the diadem to the ground. On further reflection, of course, it made sense, but at the time I was expecting at least some amount of deliberation.
Kaveh: ...Sachin's voice started talking to me inside my head from the moment I picked it up. I could feel his emotions, too... It was a mix of despair and horror swirling around inside my mind.
Kaveh: He bombarded me with his ideas relentlessly, like he was trying to brainwash me... It gave me a splitting headache that only got worse as he went on.
Kaveh: Like I was saying at the time, his views are not necessarily completely without value, but if all his research does is lead to misfortune, then we're probably better off without it.
Cyno: If his forbidden research were to spread in a harmful form, and cause people to suffer, the matra would step in and ban it.
Tighnari: I think you did the right thing. I suppose another way to approach it would have been to claim that you agreed to inherit his research, but give up the research as soon as you've inherited the wealth. But that wouldn't have been your style.
Tighnari: I won't comment on his theories or experiments, but I don't believe that he was careless in his choice of candidate... He chose you. That means he knew what he was doing.
Kaveh: Perhaps. I just think that if you accept someone else's things, you should honor their wishes.
Collei: That's a good thing... It means that you have integrity.
Kaveh: Thank you, oh my god, thank you... See, you get me, Collei!
Kaveh: It's a good thing Alhaitham isn't here right now... He'd be quick to explain why you're wrong.
Collei: Seems like you always include him in the conversation, even when he isn't here...
Tighnari: Yep. No dinner with Kaveh is complete without a few words about Alhaitham.
Cyno: I sense that Alhaitham has in fact been here with us all along...
Kaveh: He's here? Where!? Why didn't you tell me?
Cyno: ...He lives rent-free in each of our hearts.
Tighnari: ...
Collei: ...
Kaveh: That was horrifying. It literally sent chills down my spine...
Paimon: Good thing he didn't say that before we started eating. That would've killed the mood in a heartbeat...
Kaveh: Alright, enough about Alhaitham. Tighnari, did you achieve what you wanted out of the Championship?
Tighnari: I did — in the first round, in fact. Word of mouth proved very effective. I spoke to a handful of people, they told their friends, and so on. Now, a record number of people have signed up to attend the next lecture.
Tighnari: Oh, are you free next month? You should come along. Maybe even say a few words.
Kaveh: About what? I don't know the first thing about anything Amurta-related.
Tighnari: Just play to your strengths. For instance, you could talk about the distinguishing features of rainforest architecture. Or ask everyone not to chop down too many trees the next time they're building a house...
Kaveh: Oh, well that's no problem. Sure, I'll make time.
Kaveh: Has everyone had enough to eat? I can order more if anyone's still hungry.
Collei: I'm full, thanks!
Paimon: Paimon's super full too! If only we could eat like this every day, hehe!
Kaveh: Yeah, we should do this more often. Work will always be there, but seeing friends is important, too. This is a good restaurant. Let's definitely come here again.
Cyno: Sounds good. We should pick a few other places as backup options, though.
Paimon: There are other good places around here, too? Don't forget to invite us if you go! There's nothing we love more than good food!

## Talk 5

Layla: I'm sorry, everyone. I could have done better in the third round...
Sidra: Oh, stop it.
Sidra: If you're going to beat yourself up after doing as well as you did, how bad does that make us look, huh? Heck, it's not like any of us had the guts to enter the Championship.
Qamar: I didn't see the whole thing, but you were the only contestant who scored points in both the first two rounds, right?
Qamar: And I heard that you actually found the diadem first in round three. You came so close to winning the competition!
Layla: I just got lucky, I think...
Sidra: That can't be true — you had some really stiff competition out there! The renowned Tighnari from Amurta, even Cyno the General Mahamatra was there... You're amazing, all of you!
Sidra: Getting points off them is a huge achievement! The way I see it, people aren't exaggerating one bit with the nicknames they give you. You are a genuine genius!
Layla: Thanks a lot. But I really don't think I qualify as a genius... In the second round, for instance, I dozed off and somehow found myself beside the device when I came to.
Sidra: Ah, come on, don't be so hard on yourself. We've decided — we're taking you out to celebrate, and that's final!
Sidra: Let's go! Cheer up, Layla, the rest of today's all about you!
Paimon: Looks like things are going well for Layla. This is great!
Paimon: We haven't seen Hat Guy since the end of the competition... Oh well, it's almost meal time. We'd better go meet up with Kaveh and Cyno now.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Phew! Well, it looks like this Interdarshan Championship's a wrap.
Paimon: All that stuff with Sachin and the diadem got sorted, too... Have you still got anything else on your mind?
Traveler: Sachin's research...
Paimon: Oh, right... Yeah, Sachin said that he'd placed his research materials at somewhere beginning with "A," but Kaveh smashed the Diadem of Knowledge before he could finish.
Paimon: It might be dangerous if someone finds his old research stash, right? "A"... "A"... Where do you think it could be?
Traveler: "Aaru Village"?
Paimon: Holy smokes, you're right! He said he spent all that time researching in the desert, didn't he? So it's very possible that that's where he'd leave all his notes!
Paimon: Alright then, let's head off to Aaru Village and try our luck!

## Talk 7

Alhaitham: Didn't expect to run into you here.
Paimon: Alhaitham!? What're you doing here?
Paimon: And what are you reading? Are those—
Alhaitham: Sachin's notes. Yes.
Alhaitham: I came across his profile while I was organizing some documents, and became interested in his research.
Alhaitham: If it wasn't for that, I never would have agreed to being a commentator. I had a hunch after seeing the fragment of his mind, and sure enough, I came here and found his research.
Paimon: W—Wait, so you've read it already?
Paimon: Are you alright? How do you feel?
Alhaitham: I think you may have misunderstood something. The reason Sachin chose that architect to inherit his research was that only he could really empathize with both the calamity and the humanity that these notes seek to convey.
Alhaitham: Only one who resonates with these sentiments would suffer, and begin to think of history as bleak, the present as perplexing, and the future as pessimistic.
Alhaitham: Empathy is a double-edged sword. Clearly, I am not the same sort of person as Sachin was.
Alhaitham: Empaths have many friends, and their wide social circle comes with certain societal advantages. But this also makes it hard for them to achieve their goals.
Paimon: Why's that?
Alhaitham: All important things in life involve other people. As such, it's extremely difficult to live a life that causes no harm whatsoever to others.
Alhaitham: If you really want to achieve your goals, you have to be prepared to make enemies along the way. Not everyone can deal with that reality.
Alhaitham: And that reality is like the material here... objective, heavy, negative... But at the end of the day, for all these experiment results and conclusions, it's just one person's perspective — Sachin's.
Paimon: So, what are your thoughts now that you've read it?
Alhaitham: As a scholar, Sachin was, without a doubt, a genius.
Alhaitham: He laid the blame for the darkness in the world squarely on humanity, experimented extensively with reliable results, and drew logical conclusions... In that sense, one might say his views were "correct."
Paimon: So... people are bad, and things can only ever get worse? All of that's true?
Alhaitham: That is not a question for me to answer. Someone else will arrive shortly — you can ask them instead.
Alhaitham: All I will say is that the world is not built on "correctness" alone. Sometimes, being correct means nothing at all.
Traveler: Those words you wrote among your notes...
Alhaitham: "Lofty ideals may provide no defense at all against nihilism, but perhaps little decisions can."
Alhaitham: "By their own choice, the idealist seeks to bring happiness to all, while denying themselves the same. Thus they shall never reach even the borders of truth until they wipe away the ignorance that blinds them."
Alhaitham: I have never been able to agree with certain philosophies. Even Sachin himself struggled to comprehend the notion of sacrificing oneself for the greater good.
Alhaitham: But sadly, all viewpoints will find their supporters, and the way we see the world largely decides our fates.
Alhaitham: Alright, then. I got what I came for — these research materials are yours to look after. I'll be off.
Paimon: Wait. So you came here just to read this stuff? You missed out on a big get-together, you know!
Alhaitham: A get-together? ...Ah. Yes, that makes sense. This is a good opportunity for that sort of thing.
Paimon: Guess what? Kaveh treated everyone this time.
Alhaitham: Then I'm sure he packed up the leftovers for me. See ya.
Paimon: And there he goes... Well, it seems like he really wasn't affected by this research.
Paimon: He said that someone else would answer our questions. Who do you think that'll be?
Black Screen Text: You wait around near the research materials...
Nahida: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, you're already here.
Paimon: Nahida... oh, and Hat Guy.
Paimon: Wait, so you asked him to take part in the Championship?
Nahida: Yes, it was me. Are you surprised?
Traveler: A little...
Paimon: Did you know that there was something wrong with the diadem from the start? And if so, why didn't you switch it out for another one?
Nahida: Because Sachin's research is not mistaken. He spent his entire life researching this topic, and these materials are a result of that.
Nahida: These are the crystallization of his wisdom. Yes, I was worried that the material might cause some disruption, but I didn't want to wipe away all his hard work searching for the truth.
Nahida: So instead, I had Hat Guy here help me keep an eye on things.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Seriously? I think you can stop calling me that now.
Nahida: Why? Don't you like it?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...*sigh*
Nahida: ...Well, anyway — if Sachin's chosen successor hadn't been able to handle his research, or if it had brought pain to more people, he would have intervened at a suitable moment.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: And after all that, the person Sachin chose, turned his nose up at his life's work. Pretty hilarious.
Nahida: I was also hoping that this could be an opportunity for you to learn how to interact with people normally... But it looks like that didn't work out.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: That wasn't necessary. I'm still paying you back for your help, and the last thing I need is more reasons to be indebted to you.
Paimon: Nahida, what did you mean by "Sachin's research is not mistaken"? Does that mean that you approve of his research?
Nahida: Hmmm. Put it this way instead. Truth, to me, is like a Shroomboar.
Nahida: Some people only see the mushroom on the Shroomboar's back, and they conclude that a Shroomboar is a mushroom.
Nahida: Others see only the Shroomboar's body, and they declare that a Shroomboar is a boar.
Nahida: Still others look deeper inside, and determine that a Shroomboar is... meat.
Nahida: These conclusions are all correct in their own way, but none of them objectively describe the Shroomboar.
Paimon: Paimon kinda gets it... but also not really...
Nahida: The world is the same way. No one, not even I included, can understand it in its entirety. All of us are somewhere on the path toward truth.
Nahida: Within the confines of our limited knowledge, some may blindly believe in the beauty of this world, and others may focus only on its evils.
Nahida: In truth, the most important thing isn't what state the world is in now, but what people hope it will become. But of course, I don't mean that as a criticism or a call to action.
Nahida: Ultimately, my duty as the God of Wisdom is to guide every form of wisdom to a place where it can find its purpose.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: That was a long speech. So what are you actually going to do with these research materials?
Nahida: Because Kaveh, as the successor of this research, does not wish to see these ideas disseminated, I will seal it up.
Nahida: But even though Sachin's research could be considered "negative" wisdom, it is still a building block of the truth. If someone wishes to follow in his footsteps in the future, I will not stop them.
Nahida: I also look forward to the day that a member of the Vahumana Darshan can not only comprehend his theories, but also find a way out from the despair as well.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Hmph, Vahumana doesn't have that kind of talent... Wait, you're not intending to keep me in Vahumana long-term, are you?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Hah, I don't remember signing up to become a scholar. Don't you think I'm useful enough to you as a prisoner?
Paimon: Oh boy, here we go again...
Nahida: You think so? Well, to that, I would say that in Sumeru, even prisoners have the right to an education.
Nahida: I hope that your studies in Vahumana will help you deal with your own fate, and learn how best to settle old debts from your past.
Nahida: I will review your final thesis myself. I am expecting great things from you, Mr. Hat Guy.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...Tsk.
Traveler: Actually, not really...
Traveler: What did that line written in ancient script mean?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Nilou: If you don't come to Sumeru City often, classic floral designs aren't a bad choice. Those don't really go out of style.
Nilou: And of course, since you're putting this on your body, you need to consider the type of fabric the clothes are made from. Some materials might look stunning, but they can be terribly uncomfortable to wear...
Faruzan: Agreed. After all, is fashion not the constant phasing in and out of classics? In that sense, you could always consider the style I suggested, too...
Dehya: Wait. Sorry, Ma'am, but I think it could be quite a while before the style you recommended comes back into fashion...
Candace: I actually think the style recommended by Madam Faruzan is quite beautiful.
Faruzan: Isn't it just? You have a discerning eye, my dear!

### Additional Talk 2

Layla: I can't believe it, but in the end, no one was disappointed in me. What a relief.
Layla: Finally, I can get some good sleep...

### Additional Talk 3

Cyno: Since everyone is free, why don't we play a few matches of Genius Invokation TCG?
Tighnari: Eager to show off your new limited-edition card, are you?
Cyno: Not to show off. This is my way of thanking you for your help. Only my best friend will have the honor of seeing this card's debut play!
Tighnari: Alright, sure. I didn't bring my deck with me, though, so I'll need to borrow one.
Collei: Actually, Master, I made a new one a few days back...
Tighnari: ...Don't tell me you've been spending all your study hours playing cards?
Kaveh: Come on, no need to be so stern. They do say that your innate interests are your best teacher, don't they?
