Traveler: What sort of effect would there be if I speak too loud?
Bounama: That's a very good question.
Bounama: Many people overlook environmental factors when they're making things, so the fact that you even thought of asking shows that you're well ahead of the game.
Bounama: They all know that the amount of Spinel Fruit Powder you put in changes a potion's effect, and that drawing a talisman with an extra line can end up producing a completely different result.
Bounama: So why don't they seem to understand that sound too can have an effect when crafting materials?

Traveler: Aren't you afraid of losing stuff?
Bounama: Ah, you might be asking the wrong question there, friend.
Bounama: As soon as the idea of profiting from another's labor gets mentioned, even if we're talking about a morally upstanding individual, it's hard to prevent a bad seed from being planted.
Bounama: But no matter. Anyway, we're just talking about a few odds and ends that the Mol Stone House sells on commission.
Bounama: Even if one or two items go missing, all I have to do is draw a couple of prayer talismans and I'll have made my money back!

Traveler: I get where you're coming from, but our surroundings aren't quiet either...
Bounama: Hmm?
Bounama: ...Ah, well naturally, that's something that I've already taken into consideration!
Bounama: I base everything I do here on my existing environment.
Bounama: In the past, as people have come and gone, so too have a variety of different stories. These... Yes, these are also part of the production process.
Bounama: As we Masters of the Night-Wind say: "All has been understood, and the future becomes the past."
