Traveler: Hello.
Biram: Welcome to the land of the Masters of the Night-Wind. I am the tribal chief, Biram.
Biram: Most people who visit come with questions they'd like answered, but I tend to leave them stewing a while longer before they ask.
Biram: Exploring secrets and revealing fortunes leads to results of a sort, and these results are exactly what the relevant prophecies reveal.
Biram: As such, those apt to know secrets bear additional responsibility by nature.
Biram: Frankly speaking, people who keep secrets are more likely to be healthy and live longer. That's one of the universal laws of nature.
