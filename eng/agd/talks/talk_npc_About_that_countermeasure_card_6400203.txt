Traveler: About that countermeasure card...
Iris: Well, you know the popular card game "Genius Invokation TCG"? It was invented in Sumeru and then spread throughout Teyvat via Inazuma.
Iris: I'd only heard about this game before, but never tried it. Then one day, I came here to have a coffee and Nayab invited me to play a round.
Iris: I was scared out of my wits at first. I thought I'd inadvertently let slip some forbidden knowledge about King Deshret and that the matra had found me.
Iris: But it was fine in the end. After this matra came over, it was just a few bizarre deck questions from there.
Iris: That isn't the sort of thing I'm good at. I just ask the questions. As for the solutions, I let him work them out for himself.
