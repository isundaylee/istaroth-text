Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "I am Samil, a visiting researcher here for an exchange with the Fontaine Research Institute. I seem to have missed the one responsible for picking me up. Does anyone know which department I should contact in such situations?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "How did you manage to get all the way over here? I've been looking all over for you! Come back to this café tomorrow — I'll meet you here then."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Oh, right, I forgot to mention, ask for 'Mr. Horler' when you get here."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Samil, that 'Horler' is a liar and a scammer! Don't fall for his tricks!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "You're too late, 'Horler' has already taken them to the Fleuve Cendre. Tried to convince that blasted bookworm not to go, but nothing worked. All we can do now is hope for the best."
