Tlilhua: When I bless my weapon with invincibility, it blesses me with invincibility back...

Traveler: Is this... some sort of perpetual motion blessing machine?
Tlilhua: Hmm? ...Uh, not exactly...
Tlilhua: A perpetual motion machine sounds like something that doesn't exist, and if that's the case, it wouldn't work.

Traveler: Bless you.
Tlilhua: Thank you!

Traveler: So, is invincibility possible?
Tlilhua: As long as you believe, you'll make it a reality one day.
Tlilhua: ...Of course, it all stems from whether the person who bestowed the blessing is reliable.
Tlilhua: Generally, when people buy new weapons, they'd ask a well-respected friend from the Masters of the Night-Wind to help draw something on it.
Tlilhua: But as you can see, I'm a wrestler. What kind of weapon could a wrestler even use?
Tlilhua: So I mostly just buy protective equipment. And it's always reassuring when you're wearing something with a beautiful pattern on it!
