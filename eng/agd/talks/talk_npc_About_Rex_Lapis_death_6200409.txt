Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Manager Xiao: Hmph. There's nothing to be said. Someone did once ask me if Liyue would descend into chaos should Rex Lapis pass away...
Manager Xiao: My answer then was "no" — and now that the Rite of Parting has ended, Liyue Harbor's present state proves that I was right!
Manager Xiao: Liyue Harbor has become a well-oiled machine over many years of development, one that will continue to run even in the absence of its creator!
Manager Xiao: That's all from me. There's still much to do! Manning our posts and doing our duty — that's how we will honor his memory!
