# Missing title (490586423)

Paimon: Hehe, that's the way it should be! That's the kind of stable connection with the Statue of The Seven we're looking for.
Paimon: So that issue we were having before was due to that baddie in the Night Kingdom, huh? The Statue of The Seven sure must've been having a hard time back then... Great job, Statue!
Paimon: Though, it's not like you could've granted the power to resonate with Pyro even if you wanted to...
Traveler: Yeah, that happened while I was fighting alongside the Pyro Archon...
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon was super scared then... But as it turned out, you were too strong for that!
Paimon: Either way, it's great that we managed to get rid of all those Abyss monsters and restore the Statues!
