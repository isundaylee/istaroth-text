Traveler: What if you can't find ingredients?
Lynn: Haha, it's at moments like these that you'll need the Teyvat Wilderness Survivalist's Recipes!
Lynn: This contains many summaries on how to whip up survival meals, even though it may be hard for some to accept...
Lynn: All in all, you should take a look at it if you have the time. Who knows, you might need it someday.

## Talk 1

Traveler: Have you seen someone who looks very much like me?
Lynn: Oh. Well, I often help hungry adventurers by sharing a little something with them, so I might have seen the person that you want to find.
Lynn: Hmm, let me see. Well, your face does look familiar...
Lynn: Huh. Were you the one who had some barbecue lizard with me that other time?
Lynn: Speaking of which, you do look like that person I had chilled slime with! No, maybe you were the one with the frog soup...
Lynn: I... I'm sorry, I can only seem to remember the food I had with other people. I don't recall what they looked like very well...
