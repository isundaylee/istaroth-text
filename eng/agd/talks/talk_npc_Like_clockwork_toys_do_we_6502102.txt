Traveler: Like clockwork toys, do we?
Lovi: Yes. My father's a great scientist at the Fontaine Research Institute, and he brings me lots of fun toys!
Lovi: I love opening them up from the inside out and putting them back together bit by bit.
Lovi: Well, that later bit doesn't work out sometimes, but other times, I can pull it off without a hitch!
