# First Stage Ended


## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: Phew, it's finally done.
Paimon: Well, all that "ley flow" and "elemental lines" stuff Lisa was going on about should hopefully be back to normal.
Paimon: Wanna go back and see how the *Knights* are doing?
Paimon: But if you got anything more interesting to do, Paimon can come too!
Paimon: Like... going on a shopping spree... or checking out the *Statue of The Seven* again.
Paimon: At the temples of The Four Winds, we found something like... solidified wind, didn't we?
Paimon: In Mondstadt, people call them "Anemoculi."
Paimon: They're called this because they can be fitted into the statue's eyes.
Paimon: Some fairy tales say the statues' eyes originally had gems that were taken by swallows.
Paimon: But Anemoculi never had a physical form from the start.
Paimon: People with Visions collect them to offer to the *statues* in exchange for blessings.
Paimon: Unlike others with powers, you don't have a Vision. But then the rules of this world don't apply to you anyway so...
Paimon: We can go see what happens right now, if you wanna try!
Paimon: The statue in Windrise should be the closest one.
Paimon: Paimon can't wait to see what the gods do to you!

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: Wanna go back and see how the *Knights* are doing?
Paimon: But if you got anything more interesting to do, Paimon can come too!
Paimon: By the way, we obtained another Anemoculus in one of The Four Winds' temples, right?
Paimon: We might come across more of them in the future, so don't forget to offer them to the Statues!
