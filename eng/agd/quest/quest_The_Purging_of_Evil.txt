# The Purging of Evil


## Talk 1

Xiao: It's you... I remember you.
Xiao: I was purging some living beings that had been tainted by the demonic. It would appear that I have caused you some trouble.
Paimon: (Huh? He isn't usually this polite, what's going on...)
Paimon: But you were exorcizing demons, how is that causing trouble?
Xiao: That is because the changes that occurred in these monsters stem from me — or more precisely, from the karma I have accumulated.
Paimon: Mutations, karma... Does that mean...
Traveler: We read about that in the book...
Paimon: Yeah. Paimon remembers that Xiao is also called the Vigilant Yaksha, isn't he?
Paimon: So... so that means... Aww...
Paimon: *sniff* P—Poor Xiao...
Xiao: ...?
Traveler: We read about your past in a book.
Xiao: I see. You must mean that piece of literati fan fiction from a few hundred years ago.
Xiao: Hmph. All things are impermanent, and to exist is to suffer. We yakshas have no need of sympathy or tears.
Xiao: My comrades who have passed on would see your tears as a stain upon their legacy.
Paimon: Oh, uh... Paimon's sorry...
Xiao: It matters not. In any case, I am on my way to purge a cavern of demonic influence, so we shall part ways here.
Paimon: W—Wait! Take us with you! We'll be a big help, Paimon promises!
Xiao: No need. I am used to fighting alone, and in any case these mutations originated from me to begin with...
Paimon: Well then... Oh! Consider it Paimon's penance for being accidentally rude just now! ...Please?
Xiao: ...
Xiao: ...Come on then.
Traveler: We were just reading a book called "Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti."
Traveler: So Xiao is the final yaksha?

## Talk 2

Paimon: Ooh, this place gives Paimon goosebumps!
Xiao: I will use the ritual known as the Bane of All Evil to relieve this place of its karma.
Xiao: You must remain calm. Do not allow yourself to be affected by the lingering wrath of bygone gods.

## Talk 3

Xiao: It is good that we came here. An unusual number of living things had fallen under infernal influence. Had we not arrived in good time, the consequences would have been unthinkable.
Xiao: Now. This "Starsnatcher" you speak of. What is the situation?
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon'll tell you!
Xiao: An adeptus who grants wishes... To think that people could be so easily deceived by such blatant lies...
Paimon: As an adeptus, do you have the power to grant wishes, Xiao?
Xiao: The Liyue of yesteryear would never ask the adepti for boons unearned.
Xiao: Millennia ago, the ancestral people of Liyue asked for nothing more than the strength to defend the land they called their home.
Paimon: Ehh... To be honest, an adepti who grants people's wishes is probably more appealing to people nowadays...
Xiao: However feeble people nowadays may be, they are not my concern. I concern myself only with following Rex Lapis' original decree.
Paimon: Whoops... Paimon spoke without thinking again...
Paimon: Oh, ah, one more thing! That fake adeptus has a Sigil of Permission. It's what he uses to exorcise demons!
Xiao: Wait, truly? Hmph. Fool. Exorcizing demons without exterminating them — it is no wonder they have been congregating here.
Xiao: If this continues, things may spiral out of even my control... We must confiscate his Sigil of Permission.
Traveler: Confiscate? Is that all?
Paimon: Great minds think alike! Paimon agrees, we've gotta show that trickster what you get for trying to fool us!
Paimon: And it just so happens that we've got a real adeptus with us too! If Xiao were to teach Starsnatcher a lesson, you can bet he'll never dare to pose as an adeptus ever again!
Xiao: No. I only slay demons — I do not kill mortals.
Paimon: ...Who said anything about killing him!?
Xiao: ...
Xiao: It would certainly benefit Liyue if we could convince him to cease his wicked ways.
Xiao: I possess an art called Dream Trawler. It is normally used to separate the soul from the body, that one might cultivate oneself in a waking dream...
Xiao: But it can also be used to call forth the spirits of others.
Paimon: Whoa, now that's a real adepti art for ya!
Traveler: Similar to "gifting dreams and visions"?
Xiao: A ritual must be performed for this art to be used. Assist me in gathering a few items... a censer, seven lamps, and something to reduce the temperature.
Paimon: Reduce the temperature... Oh, some Mist Flowers will probably do, right?
Paimon: But as for the censer and the seven lamps... Hmm... Probably not the kinds of things we're gonna just stumble across in the wild.
Xiao: Do you know of the two yaksha statues that stand guard beside a merchant road on the southern face of Mt. Tianheng?
Xiao: The ancestors of the people of Liyue built shrines there to honor the yakshas. You should still be able to find some ceremonial items there.
Xiao: Once you have found them, meet me at the yaksha statues after nightfall, and I will teach you how to use this art.
Traveler: You'll scare him out of his wits for sure.
Traveler: I think I'd also like to teach him a lesson.
