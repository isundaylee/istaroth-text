Oroluk: Hello, are you here to interact with our adorable little fishies? Do you need any help from me or the Fishing Association?

## Talk

Traveler: I'd like to buy some fishing supplies.
Oroluk: Well, I don't have much stock here, but quality, at least, is guaranteed. Please take a look around~

Traveler: Adorable...?
Oroluk: Yes. Just see how they swim, ever so carefree, waggling their tails, in river, lake, or sea...
Oroluk: Well, I personally find them cute, and if you don't feel the same — well, that's okay too!
Oroluk: I signed up for the Fishing Association to see, catch, and raise more cutie-pies fishies.
Oroluk: However, some people are only into fishing for the delicious meat — or to sell them for Mora.
Oroluk: I mean, I get it, but I don't get involved. Most of my Association chums respect me, too.
Oroluk: Naturally, I also hope the even more people can get to know just how adorable fish are~

## Talk

Traveler: And you are?
Oroluk: Good day. I'm Oroluk, and I'm one of the staff here at the Natlan Fishing Association.
Oroluk: If you want to buy special Natlan fishing gear and bait, just leave the legwork up to me!
Oroluk: If you find things a bit remote out here, you can always leave a message at Atlahua's Net. I'm the owner's friend, and I often go there to make purchases, too!
Oroluk: But as for fishing, I'm just your average angler. I'll keep on practicing and improving, though!

Traveler: See you later, then!
Oroluk: Alright. Y'know, I've got a feeling that you're a skilled fisher... See you next time, then!
