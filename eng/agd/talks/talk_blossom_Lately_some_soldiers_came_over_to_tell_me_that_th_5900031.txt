Ikuhara Gai: Lately, some soldiers came over to tell me that they found some areas nearby from which ore can be mined, and that they even saw some rare Magical Crystal Ores.
Ikuhara Gai: As for those, well... Magical Crystal Ores are pretty high-quality stuff, alright. But it's hard to make weapons from them, so they're of little use to me.
Ikuhara Gai: I'd put them as having been around here, and I'll help you mark them out. Go check them out if you're interested.
