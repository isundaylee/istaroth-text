## Talk

Xiangling: Okay, so we have one group booked for two tables for a banquet tomorrow night... and another group who needs their order delivered around the same time... Phew...
Xiangling: #Oh! Hey, Traveler! Happy Lantern Rite!
Traveler: ...Are you alright?
Xiangling: Could be worse, could be worse! Festivals are always a little busy, you know how it is.
Xiangling: If you're craving anything off the Wanmin menu, don't worry about being a burden. However busy it gets, I'll always make time to cook for you.
Traveler: How's Guoba these days?
Xiangling: Hehe, aw, thanks for asking! Well, neither the stove nor the atmosphere are dying down any time soon, so Guoba's as happy as can be.
