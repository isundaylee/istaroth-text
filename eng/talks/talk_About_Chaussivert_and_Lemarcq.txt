Traveler: About Chaussivert and Lemarcq...
Fusilier: When I'm staying on the ship, they go to another cabin and don't bother me.
Fusilier: I always bring some snacks and drinks as gifts when I come... I don't like drinking alcohol, and don't like seeing other people drunk.
Fusilier: But, speaking of alcohol... I haven't seen a single bottle on board this ship. I asked Lemarcq, who just said that everything's already been drunk.
Fusilier: But with Chaussivert around, will the wine racks on this ship really stay empty? It's strange...
