Traveler: What is this place?
Kiminami Anna: This is Kiminami Restaurant. I, the future owner Kiminami Anna, run the place right now. Our restaurant has inherited the cooking skills of the royal head chef of the Shogunate. You could even say that we are the face of fine Inazuman cuisine.
Kiminami Anna: But let me just preface everything by saying that we've been short-staffed ever since my father disappeared, so you'll have to wait for a while if you wish to dine-in. We have lemon water with unlimited refills available in the meantime.
