# As Though Surrounded by Thunder


## Talk 1

Arataki Itto: Hmm, I'm thinkin' we spice up the final stage with a "Kaboom King"... designed after the one and oni Arataki Itto! I mean, c'mon, how epic are these horns!?
Mamoru (Mamoru, Akira, and Genta): Great idea, Boss!
Akira (Mamoru, Akira, and Genta): Great idea, Boss!
Genta (Mamoru, Akira, and Genta): Great idea, Boss!
Paimon: *sigh*... Something tells Paimon this group is about to be as useless as the one you had before...
Kuki Shinobu: Don't worry about hurting any feelings, Mr. Thoma. Just let me know if someone's being a nuisance, and I'll knock some sense into them.
"Shousei": Hornless oni... is as scary as ever...
Thoma: Haha, it's fine. As long as Itto's okay with the Kaboom King being defeated by a harpastum in the end.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Alright! It's finally time for the festival! Hopefully, everything goes okay... Do you think everyone completed their games? Let's go check it out!

## Talk 3

Traveler: An epic quest for fried tofu... It's "A Little Fox's Daydream"!
"Gyoubu Koban" (Gyoubu Koban & Swordfish II): Woohoo!
Koutoku (Gyoubu Koban & Swordfish II): Woohoo!
Yoshihisa (Gyoubu Koban & Swordfish II): Woohoo!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Miss Mizuki, that means our collaboration can—
Yumemizuki Mizuki: *snore*... So full...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: ...Can wait until you're fully rested.
Yae Miko: The winning team will take home a sum of prize money courtesy of the Yashiro Commission, along with the Tanuki Game Award.

## Talk 4

Kamisato Ayaka: ...Hm, don't you think this puzzle is a bit too complicated? If we make this small adjustment... it'd be a lot easier to understand, don't you think?
Sayu: Y—You're right! I never thought about it that way...
Yoimiya: Nice one, Ayaka! I knew you'd be a great addition to the team!
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh, no, no! You two did all the hard work! You made it easy for me...
Traveler: Hello.
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh... When did you get here...
Paimon: Just now! Seems like you're a natural, Ayaka! A real game developer at heart, huh...
Traveler: You talked about wanting to create a game the day before yesterday...
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh... You remember that. Well, brother had everything covered. So, I asked Yoimiya if she could use a hand...
Kamisato Ayaka: I'm just glad I didn't turn out to be an inconvenience.
Yoimiya: An inconvenience? We were in such a jam! You saved us!
"Kichiboushi": In a jam... because jam is sticky, and we got stuck!
Sayu: Not that kind of jam... But, it doesn't matter. We just need to get this done.
Kamisato Ayaka: #Traveler, Lady Guuji told me about the upcoming battle. As I understand it, this is an extremely dangerous endeavor, and the rest of us can only help from the sidelines...
Kamisato Ayaka: Our thoughts and prayers are with you... Be careful!

## Talk 5

Arataki Itto: Ohoho, Thoma, my bro! Heard you're in a bind! The "Almighty Arataki Unbeatable and Unmatched Game Dev Team" is here to help!
Mamoru (Mamoru, Akira, and Genta): The Arataki Gang rules!
Akira (Mamoru, Akira, and Genta): The Arataki Gang rules!
Genta (Mamoru, Akira, and Genta): The Arataki Gang rules!
Kuki Shinobu: ...I'm not sure how "helpful" most of them will turn out to be, but I, at least, am a licensed game designer.
Thoma: I'm... so sorry everyone. I was so focused on this game, I didn't notice Kinkaku and the others at all...
"Shousei": Not your fault! Bake-danuki are powerful! Even Shousei couldn't smell them!
Traveler: Yeah, we didn't notice anything either.
Thoma: #Traveler... Paimon...
Arataki Itto: Don't sweat the small stuff! I'm sure all Hitotsume Kozou and those little fellas want... is for you to honor their last wishes and finish what you set out to do!
Kuki Shinobu: Um... That was beautiful, boss. But, "last wishes" are used for people who are, y'know... dead.
Arataki Itto: Dead? As in the big sleep? The final curtain? The last hurrah? ...Genta, you copied down the wrong thing!
"Shousei": Long-horned oni is stupid... Stupid oni really help make game?
Thoma: Heh... We'll see. But, as you said, I'll try my best to, um... finish what we started.
Paimon: By the way, where are the real Hitotsume Kozou and his friends? And what about Tetsunosuke and the others?
Thoma: After the three passed out, the bake-danuki hid them in their home to keep them safe... Even under the influence of a Nightmare Fragment, bake-danuki are kind at heart.
Thoma: As for Tetsunosuke and the others... They're in charge of setting up the ritual as punishment for causing all that panic — something about showing them what it's really like to "work through the night"...?
Traveler: Sounds like Miko's doing...
Thoma: Hehe, once you deal with the crisis, I think I'll get the whole gang together — Hitotsume Kozou, Youko, Kappa...
Thoma: Plus, Kinkaku, Ginkaku, and Tetsunosuke, too... We can all play "Akitsu Harpastum" to our heart's content!

## Talk 6

Koutoku: Ah, captain! Swordfish II, salute!
Traveler: Wow, it's been a while...
Gorou: I'll say! The squad was a little reluctant to help at first... But, telling them you were the festival representative had them moving faster than an actual swordfish!
Koutoku: ...To be honest, some Watatsumi Islanders aren't too concerned about the festival, or the safety of Narukami Island.
Yoshihisa: ...But, if they knew it was for the captain of Swordfish II, I'm confident everyone would be here in a heartbeat.
Traveler: I'm not sure I deserve that level of loyalty...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: #I doubt you have a choice at this point, Traveler.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Not even the words of a Divine Priestess are enough to convince the people of Watatsumi and Narukami Islands to let go of the past.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It takes time, communication... and, most importantly, the help of very special people.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Your representation at this festival, and my collaboration with Mizuki will serve as bridges between Watatsumi Island and the outside world.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Huh, I never considered that angle... You possess wisdom beyond your years, Kokomi — on par with a certain other shrine maiden I know.
Paimon: Mizuki! Uh... Did you get any sleep at all?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I'm fine. Sometimes, you need to push past your mental limits to unleash your full potential... I've seen that many times in my line of work.
Traveler: So, that's a no, then...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I will. The good news is, the ritual is all set. That means the festival can proceed, and we can focus on realizing our vision.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: As for the more pressing matter, once the Nightmare Fragment appears, we will begin the ritual. But, it needs time to take effect.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: You and the Shogun are the only ones who can subdue the enemy until then... Do you remember what I told you yesterday, before you left for Aisa Bathhouse?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Humans, youkai, and archons bear the same capacity for emotion and are, naturally, susceptible to the same mental turmoil.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: It's very possible that someone who appears strong on the outside has learned to compartmentalize their negative emotions... And that is far from healthy.
Traveler: I remember.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Good. I trust you won't let the Shogun shoulder this alone... not anymore.
Traveler: Get a good night's sleep once this is all over.

## Talk 7

Gorou: Oh, I wanted to ask... Do you know what this strip of paper is for?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Oh, Miko wrote that. She can explain it better than me... Why don't you ask her?
Gorou: I... I think I'll ask someone else!
"Gyoubu Koban": Big dog... is afraid?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Let's see... "God of Thunder, heed our call"...

## Talk 8

Arataki Itto (Shousei & The Arataki Gang): Woohoo!
Thoma: I wish Hitotsume Kozou and the other were here. What I'd give to see the look on their faces...
Kuki Shinobu: Except... you wouldn't be able to see their expressions at all.
Yae Miko: The winning team will take home a sum of prize money courtesy of the Yashiro Commission, along with the Tanuki Game Award.

## Talk 9

Ei: ...
Traveler: You seem... unsettled.
Ei: ...Since leaving the Plane of Euthymia, I seem to experience this feeling more and more, whether in the markets of Inazuma or before the Sacred Sakura...
Traveler: I seem to have a hand in a lot of those... I'm sorry.
Ei: No, it may not be a bad thing. In the Plane of Euthymia, I could not perceive the consequences of my choices, but that did not preclude their impact.
Ei: It is only natural that I would feel their effect one day. Even a god cannot sever the link between cause and effect.
Ei: I have come to realize that isolating oneself from all engagement... is no way to reach a true state of "euthymia."
Traveler: ...
Ei: I will not unleash Musou no Hitotachi this time. I can only support you in the battle ahead.
Ei: #Using illusion against illusion, dream against nightmare... The ultimate success of this plan comes down to you, Traveler.
Traveler: (This is a last-minute plan, we don't exactly know what we're about to face, and it could all fall through at a moment's notice... But, one thing is for sure.)
Traveler: ...This time, you will not face her alone.
Sayu: Did... Did we do it...?
Gorou: Phew, just in time...
Thoma: And, it's done...
Arataki Itto: Woohoo! Right on! Big dubs for the team!
Mamoru (Mamoru, Akira, and Genta): The Arataki Gang rules!
Akira (Mamoru, Akira, and Genta): The Arataki Gang rules!
Genta (Mamoru, Akira, and Genta): The Arataki Gang rules!
Nightmare Fragments: Heh...!
Arataki Itto: Wh—What in the...
Nightmare Fragments: ...Heh...
Kujou Sara: Don't panic! Just follow the plan!
Ei: #Prepare yourself, Traveler.
Traveler: Already done.
Ei: Alright, follow me!

## Talk 10

Yae Miko: In addition, our special guest has the honor of announcing a "special award." Shogun, if you could...
Ei: ...This "special award" recognizes the team with the "most immersive game"...
Ei: And that goes to the creators of the horror game, "The Doppelganger Incident" — Kinkaku, Ginkaku, and Tetsunosuke.
Kinkaku (Kinkaku, Ginkaku, and Tetsunosuke): Eh!?
Ginkaku (Kinkaku, Ginkaku, and Tetsunosuke): Eh!?
Tetsunosuke (Kinkaku, Ginkaku, and Tetsunosuke): Eh!?
Asari: Oh, so it was a horror game all along! I really thought I'd seen a ghost!
Komura: Wow, that takes "immersive" to a whole new level... Bake-danuki are something else!
Shikanoin Heizou: Ah, smart idea... Now, people have no reason to fear the youkai.
Kujou Sara: I don't think the Shogun and Lady Guuji want the youkai to fear humans, either.
Ei: I present you this award in the name of the Narukami Ogosho, and I promise you this — no human shall infringe on your peace without cause.
Ginkaku: Shogun... is the best!
Tetsunosuke (Kinkaku & Tetsunosuke): Shogun is the best!
Kinkaku (Kinkaku & Tetsunosuke): Shogun is the best!
Traveler: What about the Shogunate's development plan...?
Yae Miko: Heh, the whole purpose of the investigation was to avoid disturbing youkai territory.
Yae Miko: Besides, the world is a big place. Humans, youkai... There's more than enough room for all of us.

## Talk 11

Yoimiya: #Alright! Traveler's got the hard stuff covered, so let's give this our all!
Kamisato Ayaka: How did you sleep last night, Sayu? Do you need a break?
Sayu: Hmm... I think I can push through, just this once... I'm sure I'll still get taller!
"Kichiboushi": Great Mujina Youkai... Good luck!

## Talk 12

Nightmare Fragments: ...Heh...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: God of Thunder, heed our call.
Kinkaku (Kinkaku, Ginkaku, and Tetsunosuke): Shatter the night, unmask it all!
Ginkaku (Kinkaku, Ginkaku, and Tetsunosuke): Shatter the night, unmask it all!
Tetsunosuke (Kinkaku, Ginkaku, and Tetsunosuke): Shatter the night, unmask it all!
Yae Miko: With your might, let illusions fall.

## Talk 13

Black Screen Text: Night falls, the games are complete, and the Mikawa Flower Festival officially begins...
Yae Miko: ...For many of us, I'm sure the last few days have seen unforgettable levels of stress and fatigue...
Yae Miko: But, for now, I hope we can put the past behind us and enjoy a night of pure, unadulterated fun.
Yae Miko: Now, before we kick things off... our representative will announce the award for "best game."
Traveler: The award for "best game" goes to...

## Talk 14

Ei: Ah, it's you. Before battle, it is imperative to calm the mind. If you have unfinished business, see to that now.

## Talk 15

"Kichiboushi" (Kichiboushi & Yoimiya): Woohoo!
Sayu: W—We won? I'm not dreaming, am I? This is real?
Kamisato Ayaka: It's real, alright. See what's possible when you set your mind to something, Sayu?
Yae Miko: The winning team will take home a sum of prize money courtesy of the Yashiro Commission, along with the Tanuki Game Award.

## Talk 16

Kirara: Komaniya Express, at your service! Oh, it's you!
Traveler: What are you doing...
Kirara: Festival delivery! Let's say you buy a bunch of stuff at a stall... Who wants to carry it around for the rest of the night?
Kirara: That's where Komaniya Express comes in! Entrust your stuff to us, and we'll deliver your festival purchases straight to your door!
