Parvaneh: Traveler... you're just in time! Have you seen Julie? The... the short Mondstadt girl who was with me!?
Traveler: No, I haven't...
Parvaneh: Youâ€” You haven't seen her either? Where on earth did that idiot go...
Traveler: What happened?
Parvaneh: Julie suddenly disappeared. No, well... maybe it's not accurate to say that she "suddenly" disappeared.
Parvaneh: We met an old man named Kamei Munehisa when you last came with us to collect ingredients. Do you remember him?
Traveler: Sort of, yes...
Parvaneh: Yeah. He defeated the monsters near the camp and gave us ingredients from around those parts.
Parvaneh: Ever since we got back, Julie has been talking about sending him food to show our appreciation...
Parvaneh: Xudong and I thought she was just saying it. However, she left a note in the camp today and actually went looking for him.
Parvaneh: The idiot... She doesn't know what she's doing! That Kamei Munehisa looked so suspicious!
Parvaneh: *sigh* Xudong and I split up. He went to find the place where we met Kamei Munehisa the previous time. I came to the Adventurers' Guild to post a missing person commission.
Parvaneh: I can't believe that she actually dared to run off with how things are in Inazuma right now... We must find her, and quickly!
Traveler: I'll go with you.
Parvaneh: That would be great.
Parvaneh: Xudong and I have agreed on a rendezvous point, so we'll meet him there first.
Traveler: If she runs into a monster...
Parvaneh: If Julie runs into a monster... Honestly, I'd be more worried for the monster.
Parvaneh: But if she runs into the Kairagi or something like that, that would be bad. Kairagi can't be dealt with in the same way as monsters...
Parvaneh: Even if Xudong and I joined forces, it would still be...
Traveler: I can help, too.
Parvaneh: Huh? You're willing to help? That would be great.
Traveler: The samurai?
