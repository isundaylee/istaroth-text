Layla: How many reports do I still have left to write...? Four... Oh, no, five...
Layla: Ugh, no no no... I gotta stop worrying so much about everything! The whole point of me taking a vacation was to come here and relax.
Layla: #Traveler? When did you get back?

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Layla: Oh, don't worry, I've got everything I need here, no complaints at all.
Layla: Usually, I'm pretty picky about whether the place has any pesky bugs flying around...
Layla: You know, the kind that keep buzzing around the room and distracting you.
Traveler: Oh, you mean Cicins?
Layla: Yeah! Those are the ones!
Layla: They may be tiny, but when they go buzzing right by your ear in the dead of the night... BZZT! Ugh, it's so annoying.
Layla: I used to always lose sleep because of those pests, but thankfully there's nothing like that here.
Layla: It's tidy and peaceful here. Practically an oasis for insomniacs like me!
Traveler: You mean Fireflies?
Layla: No, not those... Oh, c'mon, I'm not an entomology major and even I know that Fireflies aren't anything like what I'm talking about.

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Layla: Sure, that would be nice.
Layla: Hmm, lemme think about what would be interesting for you... Ah, I know!
Layla: The Sighing Spirit of the Laboratory... ever heard of it?
Traveler: What's that?
Layla: Hehe, so there are *some* things you don't know then.
Layla: Okay, so get this: There's this creepy laboratory in our institute where strange things happen.
Layla: Several people say that when they've walked by that lab at night, they heard the sound of someone sighing inside.
Layla: But then, when they opened the door to check, the room was completely dark and there was nobody inside.
Layla: Weird stuff like this happens a couple of times a week. And it's bad luck for the one who hears it: It means you'll flunk your next exam.
Traveler: Seriously?
Layla: Huh? You don't believe it? Just ask my classmates, almost everyone will tell you the same.
Layla: And even the ones who don't believe it still go out of their way to avoid that place.
Layla: Nobody wants to risk failing their exams, you know.
Traveler: Sounds a little superstitious to me...

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Layla: Things I want to do? Let's see, where to start...
Layla: Hmm... I can think of a dozen things just off the top of my head. Take a really nice nap, walk all around this beautiful place...
Layla: But if you mean what I want to do most, right here and now, then... I guess it'd be to simply do nothing.
Traveler: Nothing at all?
Layla: Oh! Uh, I mean, you're so nice and all, and everything here just makes me feel so comfortable...
Layla: I didn't mean there's anything wrong with this place. That's not what I'm trying to say at all!
Traveler: It's okay, just speak your mind.
Layla: Ahem... Okay, thanks...
Layla: ...As you can see, I lack confidence no matter what I do, there's always something worrying me.
Layla: I'm under a lot of pressure, and it really stresses me out... I don't know if I'm studying hard enough, or how my future will turn out...
Layla: Whether it's studying, or even just life in general... There are so many things I have yet to get the hang of.
Layla: And I'm always scared that I'll miss something important... Ugh, I'll never be able to forgive myself if that happens!
Layla: It's exhausting, but I guess you already saw that... Which is probably why you suggested I take a vacation a—and get some proper rest, right?
Traveler: Yes, I could tell you needed it.
Layla: Hehe, well, at least I was smart enough to figure that out...
Layla: ...And to realize that I should really take you up on your offer, and make sure I get a good rest for once!
Layla: Whew, alright, it's decided... my mind needs a rest. So I'm not going to do anything, or worry about anything at all.
Traveler: Here, come with me...
Layla: Perfect! Let's go relax and just let the day pass by!
Traveler: I'll find a nice patch of grass for us to lie on for a while.
Traveler: Why'd you say so?

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Layla.
Layla: Mm, morning... Wait, morning!? How is it light out already...
Layla: Ugh, whyyy... I still wasn't able to fall asleep yet... Can't I just try a little longer? *groan*

## Talk

Traveler: Goodnight, Layla.
Layla: #Goodnight, Traveler! This is it... the most critical time of the day.
Layla: Tonight I'm going to focus again on clearing my mind... No schoolwork, no assignments, nothing! Keeping it completely blank...
Layla: Please, oh please just let me get some sleep tonight... I need it sooo bad!

## Talk

Layla: This place feels kinda... yeah, a lot like where I live. Cozy and familiar.
Layla: Definitely the kind of place where you can have a proper rest and really relax.
Layla: At first, I was worried I wouldn't be able to get to sleep without my normal bed, or that I... Well, anyway, turns out I was worrying for nothing.

## Talk

Layla: Little white houses, plants exclusive to the desert climate... Hmm... Okay, I think I've got it.
Layla: It's Aaru Village, isn't it? Reminds me of the first time I was out around those parts doing some fieldwork.
Layla: When there's time, I'll have to tell you all about what happened on that trip. There are quite a few interesting bits.
