# Missing title (3630716863)


## Talk 1

Conulaf: *sob* Freed I am at last! Freed from this Saurian cart!
Conulaf: Ugh. That cart was so stuffy and hot... and stinky, too! I sat in it for half a day, and I already feel like it shaved two or three years off my lifespan...
Traveler: You again? Really? What happened this time?
Conulaf: Ah, it's you, my savior! I did not expect to run into— I mean, have you rescue me again during our respective travels...
Conulaf: Ah, did I not say previously that my name is Conulaf, a trainee priest of the Masters of the Night-Wind?
Conulaf: My training's a work in progress at the moment, and to that end, the elders of the tribe told me that there are ancestral treasures to be found all over Natlan. "Go do some treasure-hunting, Conulaf!" they said.
Conulaf: And so they kicked me out of the tribe under the guise of training—
Conulaf: And well, my keen ears picked up some clues about treasure to be found nearby... Something about finding it if I followed the footsteps of some beast.
Conulaf: But doesn't that refer to a Sumpter Beast, I thought? Or could it be an Alpaca instead?
Conulaf: Either way, I followed a Sumpter Beast to the camp these folks had made, and thinking I was some manner of Sumpter Beast thief, they locked me up...
Conulaf: Forget the buried treasure, I was about to be buried myself...
Traveler: You had an incomplete trail of clues to begin with...
Conulaf: Right you are! I shan't act quite so rashly going forward... Hmm. Perhaps that lesson is the greatest treasure I could have obtained from this incident.
Conulaf: *sigh* I'll have to find a place to take a nice shower to get this smell off me.
Conulaf: Thank you so much, my savior! Allow me to give you a humble token, drawn from my limited traveling expenses, to show my gratitude...

Conulaf (???): Ugh. That cart was so stuffy and hot... and stinky, too! I sat in it for half a day, and I already feel like it shaved two or three years off my lifespan...
Traveler: Who are you, and how did you wind up here?
Conulaf: Ah, yes, I haven't introduced myself. Call me Conulaf, a trainee priest of the Masters of the Night-Wind...
Conulaf: My training's a work in progress at the moment, and to that end, the elders of the tribe told me that there are ancestral treasures to be found all over Natlan. "Go do some treasure-hunting, Conulaf!" they said.

Conulaf: Right you are! I shan't act quite so rashly going forward... Hmm. Perhaps that lesson is the greatest treasure I could have obtained from this period of imprisonment.
Conulaf: *sigh* Still, I'll have to find a place to take a nice shower to get this smell off me.
Conulaf: Thank you so much, my savior! Allow me to give you a humble token, drawn from my limited traveling expenses, to show my gratitude...
