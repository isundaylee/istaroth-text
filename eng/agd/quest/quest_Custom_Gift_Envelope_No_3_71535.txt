# Custom Gift Envelope No. 3


## Talk 1

Dehya: #Fancy seeing you in these parts, Traveler. You must be here for Lantern Rite, too!
Traveler: Are you making a gift envelope?
Dehya: Yeah, I'm trying make one for Candace, but I'm not happy with the result so far. I was just about to start from scratch.
Traveler: Did Candace not come with you?
Dehya: Not yet, but she'll be here.
Dehya: She didn't agree to come with me to Liyue at first. Said she had to stay behind to protect the village.
Dehya: I told her everyone deserves to let loose at the end of the year. I had to escort a caravan to Liyue, anyway, so she might as well come along.
Dehya: I even offered for some of my guys to look after the village in the meantime.
Dehya: But, I couldn't convince her. In the end, she only changed her mind because the people in the village pestered her to take time off.
Dehya: Even then, she still insisted on wrapping up some work first.
Dehya: But, the caravan waits for no one... So, I'm here on my own for now.
Dehya: It was so hard to pick out a gift â€” there are just too many nice things to choose from around here!
Dehya: I ended up getting her a necklace, but then I heard about the whole gift envelope tradition during Lantern Rite, so I decided to try making one.
Dehya: And, well... Like I said, it hasn't been going great.
Dehya: #I'm sure you know more about this than me, Traveler. Can you give me some tips?
Traveler: No problem, let me take a look...

## Talk 3

Dehya: Ooh? Looks like you've got a real knack for crafts. This gift envelope is beautiful, thank you!
Dehya: I guess this is like your gift to me! I don't have anything on me right now, but once I'm back in Sumeru, I'll be sure to send you something in return.
Dehya: Now, I just need to make one for Candace so I can give it to her with the necklace. I'm sure she'll love it!
Dehya: Ah, that reminds me, I wonder if she's here yet... It's been a while...
