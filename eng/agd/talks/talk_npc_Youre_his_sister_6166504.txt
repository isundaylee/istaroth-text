Traveler: You're... his sister?
Iris: Yes. We actually look quite alike, don't you think?
Iris: As for why he looks like he's from Mondstadt while I look like I'm from Liyue... It's a long story. Something to do with our parents.
Iris: ...Ho, do you mean to ask why I look younger than he does?
Iris: There's no big secret behind it. It's just a matter of maintenance and attention.
