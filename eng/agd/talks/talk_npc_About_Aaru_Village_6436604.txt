Traveler: About Aaru Village...
Arshia: If you head toward the western desert from Caravan Ribat, you should pass by Aaru Village if you don't stray too far from the path.
Arshia: Life there is simple, and bound by some traditional rules and regulations, but I'm really fond of the unique comforts of a small village that it presents.
Arshia: Everyone in the village is very friendly. It doesn't matter if you're a lost adventurer or an exiled researcher, we're willing to take you in all the same.
Arshia: ...Of course, you must have no malice toward the village. Otherwise, prepare to face the wrath of Candace.
