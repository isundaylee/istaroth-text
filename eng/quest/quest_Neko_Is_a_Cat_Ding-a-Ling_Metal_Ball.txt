# Neko Is a Cat: Ding-a-Ling Metal Ball


## Talk 1

Neko: Meow meow, when did that stone become the spitting image of me...
Traveler: How's the statue?
Neko: The stone human says that he will finish knocking on this stone soon.
Neko: Hibiki will be so happy when she returns.
Neko: Hmm, yes. This stone is good, but we must dress the shrine's surroundings up a bit, yes?
Neko: Please, help me hang these round, tinkling metal balls around the shrine.
Neko: These things were prepared by Hibiki. If memory serves, Domeki gave them to her because she loved playing with me and other children. It took quite a lot of effort to find them again.
Traveler: Huh. These are... bells?
Neko: "Bells?" I am not sure what those are, but Hibiki used to use these metal balls when playing with me.
Neko: She would put the metal balls on the ground, and then knock them far away. They would make this tinkling noise whenever they moved.
Neko: I do not understand what power they possessed, but the sound they made would always attract myself and the other cats to chase them.
Neko: I came to understand, therefore, that the reason why few people have come to pay respects is because the shrine presently lacks metal balls.
Neko: Thus, I request your help in hanging these metal balls in high places.
Neko: That way, humans will hear the tinkling of the metal balls and come to this shrine, and they will not lose their way.
Neko: The Offering Box will be full of Mora, and the shrine will thrive... and Hibiki will be very happy when she returns.
Neko: So, please help me hang these metal balls around the shrine.
Traveler: I got it.
Neko: Thank you, meow meow.

## Talk 2

Neko: These metal balls will attract more people. That will surely please Hibiki.

## Talk 3

Neko: Have you hung them all up?
Traveler: All done.
Neko: Meow meow, wonderful. This will surely make the shrine a livelier place.
Neko: ...
Neko: Hmm. Why haven't lots of humans come here yet?
Traveler: I don't think they'll come so quickly...
Neko: Ah, humans are so hard to understand. Well, you are an exception, of course. You are more enlightened.
Neko: There may not be any people now... But at least those little rascals won't get lost anymore, meow meow.
Neko: The stone human says that the stone will be ready very soon. Do come and see it.
Neko: ...Hmm, yes, there was one other thing. A strange thing.
Neko: I went to ask those two green humans about Hibiki and Domeki.
Neko: Both of them said that they didn't know Hibiki or anything about her.
Neko: But the tall green human said that he had read about an "Ako Domeki."
Neko: He talked about... "bandit" this and "bounty" that... Whatever the case, he was trying to say that Domeki was a bad person.
Neko: There must be some mistake. Hibiki would always play with him, so Domeki must've been a good person.
Neko: That human's comprehension must be lacking. You're still the most reliable human after all, it seems...
Neko: Ah, when will Hibiki come back...
Traveler: It's not that simple...
