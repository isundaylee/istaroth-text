Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.</color>
Aoi: How strange. No one's ever invited me to go attend such an event before.
Paimon: Well, that's why we're here! Hehe.
Paimon: You must have music you really love, right, Aoi? We could play it for you â€” we're serious musicians!
Aoi: Music, you say? Well... There is one that I heard a long while back. I was your height when I last heard it, I believe.
Aoi: I only remember bits and pieces of it, but could you play it for me all the same?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Aoi: Thank you.
