Traveler: So, do you have any ideas for kimono patterns?
Tang Wen: Kimono patterns? I'm afraid I don't know anything about that...
Tang Wen: But if you were to ask me... I think that books might look great as a design on a kimono.
Tang Wen: Hmm, books printed on kimonos... Now wouldn't that be interesting...

Traveler: What's on your mind?
Tang Wen: I'm thinking of the current situation of Inazuma and the Raiden Shogun's policies...
Tang Wen: I couldn't return to my hometown to see the Rite of Parting due to the Sakoku Decree, but somehow, I also happened to witness a turning point in Inazuma's history.
Tang Wen: Ah, I'm so sorry. I forgot to mention that I'm a historian from Liyue. Although I can't go home for now, I did get a chance to document the change of policy in Inazuma. It's been such a blessing in disguise.
Tang Wen: Hmm... About these policies. I still cannot come up with a final conclusion. I think that in order for us to judge a piece of history, we must document it completely first.
Tang Wen: Therefore, I have decided to stay here for a while and witness future developments in Inazuma.

Tang Wen: I couldn't return to my hometown to see the Rite of Parting due to the Sakoku Decree. But on the other hand, I also happened to witness a turning point in Inazuma's history.
Tang Wen: Ah, right, sorry. I forgot to mention this before, but I'm a scholar of history from Liyue. I'm presently in Inazuma to record the changes occurring here.
Tang Wen: Hmm... Still, I've yet to reach a final conclusion regarding these policies. I think that in order for us to judge a piece of history, we must first document it completely.
Tang Wen: As such, I've decided to remain here for a while yet to witness everything with my own two eyes.

Traveler: What's on your mind?
Tang Wen: I'm thinking about how times can change oh so quickly...
Tang Wen: Just like how I couldn't return to Liyue to see the Rite of Parting due to the Sakoku Decree, and yet I also happened to witness a turning point in Inazuma's history.
Tang Wen: Ah, right, sorry. I forgot to mention this before, but I'm a scholar of history from Liyue. My greatest wish is to see history with my own two eyes.
Tang Wen: It is my belief that in order for us to judge a piece of history, we must first document it completely.
Tang Wen: My time in Inazuma has really got me thinking about how history can be winding, and yet change so very suddenly, too...
Tang Wen: Fortunately, I'm no longer some student who needs to worry about her next thesis.
Tang Wen: Those graduate students who had Inazuman history as their subject are probably in for it now: in the worst case, they might even have spend several sleepless nights rewriting their theses.

Traveler: What was Inazuma like before?
Tang Wen: I think using words like happy or joyful to describe the Inazuma locals back then isn't really accurate... A more appropriate word would be "vigorous."
Tang Wen: The Inazuma locals before the lockdown would still worry about life's troubles. However, they had a vigor then that cannot be matched now.
Tang Wen: People are indeed living stable and peaceful lives, but if you look at the closed borders, the closed shops, and the patrolling samurai who go around seizing Visions... I don't think that anyone can feel at ease in such an oppressive situation.
Tang Wen: And this is not to mention those people whose life took a drastic turn after they lost their Visions.
Tang Wen: Does the Raiden Shogun, who seeks Eternity, really desire an Inazuma that looks like this...

Traveler: So, what have you heard about the Rite of Parting?
Tang Wen: To be honest, I was really terrified when I learned about Rex Lapis' passing in a letter from Liyue...
Tang Wen: Aside from being shocked, I also somehow felt regret that I was not in Liyue at such a crucial moment.
Tang Wen: I could only write to my family and my fellow researchers, asking them to document what happened at that time...
Tang Wen: Ah, Rex Lapis lived through thousands of years. If he were still around and saw what's happened in Inazuma, I wonder what he would say...

Traveler: Tell me about the changes occurring in Inazuma...
Tang Wen: Ever since the Sakoku Decree was abolished, I can feel "life" returning to Inazuma.
Tang Wen: You can see it on people's faces, the way they once again shine with a happiness that can only come from within.
Tang Wen: I believe that this Inazuma reflects the true goal of the Raiden Shogun, who seeks Eternity...
