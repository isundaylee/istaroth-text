Sucrose: #Traveler, Paimon, how's the potion-making been going lately?
Paimon: Sucrose, you're back!
Traveler: It's been going great!
Sucrose: I should have known. You really do have a talent for alchemy.
Sucrose: I'm sure this exam will also be a walk in the park for you.
Sucrose: Well, ready to begin?
Traveler: Check the exam requirements...
Traveler: I still need a little more time...
Sucrose: Alright! No rush! Take as much time as you need.
Traveler: We're still working out some kinks...
Sucrose: Well, you just need to keep practicing! You'll get the hang of it in no time.
Sucrose: As for the Intermediate exam, just think of it as a practice session, and you'll be fine.
