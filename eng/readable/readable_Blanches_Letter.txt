# Blanche's Letter

Mr. Traveler and Ms. Paimon, it's me, Blanche!
Surprised? You didn't expect me to write so soon, right? Hehe!
Actually, it's nothing. I just found some super huge, super sweet Bulle Fruits. I've had a lot of them in my life, but ones like these are a first! As such, I wanted you to have some too.
I hope they are still fresh when you read this letter.
