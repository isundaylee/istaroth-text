Hajime: Ah, are you asking about locations where you can find our locally-produced ores? Well, I do have some intel. It's just that my work here as an apprentice at Amenoma Smithy keeps me ever so occupied...
Hajime: How about this, then? I'll mark these ore locations on your map. Bring them back to me, and I'll see what I can do about them.
