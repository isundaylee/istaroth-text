Long ago, Inazuma had five legendary poets
People bestowed upon them the title of The Five Kasen
One Year
The poet Suikou made his way to Tenshukaku
And presented the Kasen's work for the Shogun's perusal
But a page from the works of Aoi no Okina had been torn out
And Suikou was questioned regarding the matter
Suikou pleaded guilty
He admitted to drinking at the tavern the night before
And vaguely recalled a mysterious figure approaching while he was intoxicated
That figure was none other than Aoi no Okina himself
This turn of events had begun with an unnamed individual
Under whose coercion Aoi no Okina was forced
To take drastic measures to retrieve a page of poetry
He knew nothing
Of this individual's true intentions
All he knew was that
The poem had to do with an old acquaintance, Akahito
Akahito had once belonged to the Five Kasen
Each poem he composed, he marked with a scarlet red seal
Hence the "Aka" in his name
Such a distinguished writer was he
And yet one of the poems he had submitted the previous year
Was found to be plagiarized
Akahito was exiled for his crimes
And only four of the Five Kasen remained
Sumizome went over Akahito's poems
And noticed that the plagiarized poem lacked his seal
She immersed his poetry in a stream nearby
And only on the plagiarized poem
Did the ink run
Aoi no Okina passed by
And witnessed Sumizome's doing
Which he then recorded in a poem
Thus transpired the events of Suikou's poetry submission
And this is where the story comes to an end
