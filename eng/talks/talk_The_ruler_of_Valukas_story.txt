Traveler: The ruler of Valuka's story.
Arakarman: What an embarrassment... Even Arakarman might not know much about the ruler of Valuka's story.
Arakarman: But Arakarman knows that the Nara of Valuka are stronger than the Nara of Vana.
Arakarman: Then the ruler of Valuka must be a very amazing ruler, even if they were not as powerful as Queen Aranyani. I heard that he built stone pillars higher than the tallest trees in Valuka.
Arakarman: But after that, Arakarman did not hear much about the ruler of Valuka.
Arakarman: Because bad Marana appeared in Vana, Aranara were unwilling to hear anymore about Valuka.
Arakarman: After many sunrises and moonrises, very few Aranara know that even Valuka had a ruler.
