Traveler: Hello. What is this place?
Caramuru: This is an Obsidian Totem Pole. Pretty awesome, huh? They say you can directly connect to the Wayob here!
Caramuru: It's just that sorta sacred relic... although the details escape me. Haha, that's what you get when you've never been good at history.
Caramuru: If there's anything more you'd like to know, feel free to consult the person on the night shift!
Caramuru: Whatever the case, so long as you're willing to help us People of the Springs a little, the Totem Pole won't do you dirty.

Traveler: Good day.
Caramuru: Hello, hello! Sorry, but I can't chat for too long.
Caramuru: Now I'm not an introvert, but working hours are as they are, and getting caught slacking off could go badly for me.
Caramuru: What work am I doing, you ask? Why, shift duty! And how will I do that? ... Well, by being here, am I right?
