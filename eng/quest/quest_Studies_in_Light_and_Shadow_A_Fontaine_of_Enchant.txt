# Studies in Light and Shadow: A Fontaine of Enchantment


## Talk 1

Bresson: Have faith in yourself, Bresson... Have faith. All the tools have been prepared...
Bresson: You just need to... go underwater. Yes, underwater... Go there and prove that these tools are reliable, and your work will be complete!
Traveler: What are you doing?
Bresson: Eh? Where did you come from? I didn't hear you coming at all!
Bresson: I almost fell into the water, you know — if I hadn't regained my balance, the future of photography in Fontaine would have gone down the... water!
Traveler: Sorry about that.
Paimon: Wait, don't you know how to swim?
Traveler: And you're from Fontaine, aren't you?
Bresson: Who... Who said that people from Fontaine must know how to swim? Not every person from Liyue can cook, and not every Mondstadter's a poet!
Bresson: Whatever. I went through all this effort to get diving apparatus. Today, I must go underwater to take some pictures...
Paimon: Oh, so that's what going on...
Traveler: Is there something special about this Kamera?
Bresson: Special? I, Bresson Cartier, modified the Kamera personally. This is why it's "special."
Bresson: My modification techniques are strict and ingenious, and I only use the very finest materials.
Bresson: The lens is countless times better than those you'll find on any other Kameras. Indeed, there will be no loss in image quality even if you go underwater!
Bresson: But those people in the Kamera Club... They don't care about my new techniques at all. They claim that the key to photography lies in the skill of the photographers themselves, and not their tools...
Bresson: But just you wait, I say. I will take some brilliant pictures, and shut those ignoramuses right up!
Bresson: Phew... Come on, Bresson. Believe in yourself... Believe... the water is warm and comfy, and it's definitely not full of man-eating fish...
Bresson: I... I... Ugh, will this divesuit really work? Will it suddenly explode underwater!?
Bresson: After which I shall be dragged into the watery depths, never to be seen again... I... Oh, Archons...
Traveler: If you really can't do it, I can help you...
Bresson: Really? Would you do this? Would you aid me? A most generous soul, you are! Indeed, my savior!
Traveler: Well, I expect to be paid, regardless.
Bresson: Well, of course I won't be making you do this for free. Your recompense will be rich, trust me!
Bresson: Ah yes, right. Allow me to mark some good underwater scenery on your map...
Bresson: There are also some on land... Uh... That should be around here... This is brand-new equipment, after all. It wouldn't hurt to test them out at a few more spots.
Bresson: Alright, this will do. I leave Fontaine's technical photographic future and my vision for Kamera tools in your capable hands.
Bresson: I shall... uh, wait for you on the shore.
Traveler: I'll need remuneration according to Guild rules.
Traveler: Why don't I take some photos underwater for you?
Traveler: I didn't expect you to react that intensely...

## Talk 2

Bresson: You're back. Is there something you'd like to ask me?
Traveler: Who are you, again?
Bresson: Me? I am a member of the Fontaine Adventurers' Guild, and I am also a card-carrying member of the Kamera Club.
Bresson: However, the people of the Club always say that the quality of the photo depends on the skill of the one taking it.
Bresson: I've heard that some people even intentionally use outdated Kameras to take photos in order to hone their skills... That just seems like looking for trouble to me.
Bresson: I, on the other hand, believe that better equipment takes better photos.
Bresson: And they say I don't understand artistry... Hmph. Well, I for my part say they don't understand photography!
Bresson: But they'll understand someday — you mark my words! Engineering is the key! Engineering!
Traveler: Why won't you go diving?
Bresson: Well... You know how some people don't like to eat mushrooms, and how others might throw up when eating fish? That's just the thing — everyone's body is different.
Bresson: I can't take the dark environment underwater — why, I grow breathless if I remain in there for too long.
Bresson: Sometimes I feel my limbs tingle, my head spin, and then... Before I realized it, the Kamera would've slipped from my hand...
Bresson: I have been loath to go underwater ever since losing my fifth Kamera this way...
Traveler: See you.
Bresson: Then I'll leave the photo-taking to you. In the meantime, I'll be on the shore.
