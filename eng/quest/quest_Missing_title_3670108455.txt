# Missing title (3670108455)

Sakaw: Oh, have you come to take pictures? Foreign tourists have come here before, wishing to do the same. That floating island is quite the view, after all...
Sakaw: It's just a shame we didn't have Kamera previously — I had to ask a foreign merchant I knew to get me one.
Sakaw: How about it, dear guest? Care for a picture? But you'll have to do it yourself. I'm not exactly a dab hand at photography...
Traveler: Strange, there's fog over the sea...
Sakaw: Fog? What do you mean? There can't be fog with such a strong sea breeze...
Sakaw: I have never seen fog over the sea since the day I was born.
Sakaw: Might you have confused this place with the fog-shrouded area that Tezcatepetonco Range overlooks, by any chance?
Traveler: Perhaps...
Sakaw: Hehe, if you ask me, I'd say you're just too nervous.
Sakaw: You should loosen up — you're touring Natlan, after all.
