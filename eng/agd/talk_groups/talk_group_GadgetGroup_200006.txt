Firmly Fixed Letter: "...eliminated. Nacker and Edwin Eastinghouse are in the Fortress of Meropide, so another solution must be found. Quickly recover materials and instruments related to the Arkhium Kinetic Core from the lab, and destroy anything and everything else. Also, contact has been lost with Marigold, meaning investigations within the Fortress of Meropide have ended. Return once clean-up is complete. And be quick."
