# Gazing Three Thousand Miles Away


## Talk 1

Chouji: People from abroad, come and have a look! This is the best Jakotsu Crystal in Yashiori Island!
Chouji: C'mon, check it out! Goods of this quality used to go straight to the Shogunate. Get it at a discount here, Adventurers, and you'll be making weapons that'll cut through steel like butter in no time!
Traveler: How much is it?
Chouji: Well, let me see... Five crystals for 300,000 Mora, 15 crystals for 900,000 Mora, a batch of 30 crystals for... 1.8 million Mora. Thanks for your patronage!
Traveler: Talk about pricey!
Paimon: Might as well commit daylight robbery!
Chouji: Haha, I get it. For you outlanders, so far away from home, it's gotta be hard to part with your Mora.
Chouji: After all, the mine's been shut down because of the war, and there's this Tatarigami or whatever causing a nuisance on the island. That's what the grown-ups say anyway...
Chouji: Well, my own supplies are running low. Scarcity drives prices up, y'know?
Chouji: Besides, this stuff contains a "risk premium," too~
Paimon: "Risk premium"? What do you mean?
Traveler: What does "risk premium" even mean...
Chouji: Well... I'm a kid making money like an adult, so I run the risk of discovery by the Tenryou Commission — that's what I mean by "risk premium"!
Traveler: Ah, so that's how it is.
Chouji: It's fine if you don't want to buy it right now. I'll be around here anytime should you change your mind.
Paimon: This kid speaks all funny...
Traveler: What about your parents?
Chouji: They're doing great, thank you for asking!
Chouji: My parents are both miners. Mined these crystals in my hands themselves, in fact! In the past, the foreman would collect everyone's ore and give it to the big shots in the city. Shove 'em all into boxes to be transported to Tatarasuna.
Chouji: But now that we're at war, the adults in the city won't be coming this way anymore...
Chouji: So we have to sell our own ore and earn our own Mora!
Chouji: See, such high-quality ore like this used to go straight to the Shogunate. Now, even adventurers like yourself can buy these unblemished gems, and at a fair price too!
Chouji: And I get to make Mora just like grown-ups. Guess this war ain't all bad, eh?
Paimon: Whoa, was this kid born an optimist, or is there something here that Paimon's not seeing?
Chouji: Hmm, oh right... Can I ask you to help me with something?
Traveler: That's me, everyone's little helper.
Chouji: Hehe, I mean, you look like a nice person. Someone a kid like me can trust, y'know?
Chouji: Besides, they've got this saying in Liyue, don't they? "The deal may be off, but our honor still stands." And we Inazuman samurai are the most honorable people there are!
Paimon: Whoa, isn't this little fella full of surprises...
Chouji: You see, the mines have been closed due to recent events.
Chouji: And those crystals are too hard and heavy... I can't collect them myself.
Paimon: Hey, didn't you say that you wanted to make Mora like an adult?
Traveler: You meant "make money off other people's labor" like an adult.
Chouji: Hehe, you sure got me there.
Paimon: Ha, even you admit it!
Chouji: That's right, 12 pieces, please!
Paimon: Who's going to help you, huh? You slippery little brat!
Chouji: Don't get mad, I'll make it worth your while. There's stuff in it for you, too!
Chouji: When we sell the crystals, we'll split the earnings fifty-fifty!
Paimon: And you'll sell them, how?
Chouji: Well, if you don't want to wait... How about this, then? I'll sell you the crystals you mined for half the price, and we'll split my earnings fifty-fifty!
Chouji: I mean, I'll be making a loss! What do you say? You've never seen such an awesome deal in your life, am I right?
Paimon: Paimon's never seen a businessman this shameless, more like...
Chouji: Hmm, in that case, I'll just have to resort to "that"...
Paimon: And what's "that"?
Chouji: Treasure! A chest full of treasure!
Paimon: Ooh! Treasure!
Traveler: Paimon, watch your step.
Paimon: #Oh yeah... that's true, you're right, Traveler!
Paimon: Hmph, show it to us first then, or Paimon won't believe a word of it!
Chouji: I can't.
Paimon: So what are you trying to sell us, here?
Chouji: Calm down! What I mean is that there's so much treasure and it's so heavy that I can't carry it all by myself...
Chouji: But I can tell you where it's hidden! You can trust me.
Chouji: What do you say? You interested?
Paimon: This kid seems super shady no matter how you look at this... but if there's treasure to be had...
Paimon: #It'd be a shame to give it up... What do you say, Traveler?
Traveler: Okay.
Chouji: Relax, I wouldn't lie to you!
Traveler: No tricks, kiddo.
Traveler: He's exaggerating again.
Traveler: So you want us to mine for you, then?
Traveler: I'm listening.
Traveler: That doesn't seem right somehow...
Traveler: Would you take a Paimon for those goods?
Paimon: Hey! What's that supposed to mean?

## Talk 2

Chouji: You're back. Do you have the crystals with you?
Traveler: Sure do.
Traveler: They're on the way.
Chouji: No hurry, stay safe now!

## Talk 3

Chouji: #Traveler, you're back!
Traveler: We've investigated the shrine.
Paimon: Unfortunately, your mother didn't leave any messages there...
Chouji: Oh...
Paimon: But someone did leave a lot of Sakura Bloom petals there.
Traveler: It's the flowers your mother offered.
Chouji: Eh...?
Paimon: Sorry, Chouji. We couldn't find any more information...
Chouji: It's fine. I understand.
Chouji: #Thank you for your hard work over these last few days, Traveler.
Chouji: Now... I need to figure out what to do next.
Traveler: Aren't you going to find the Commissioner?
Chouji: Well... Thanks, but I won't. We don't trust the city folk.
Chouji: Thanks, but I don't want to trouble you anymore.
Chouji: And... I don't want to be taken care of.
Paimon: The kid is very grown-up for his age...
Chouji: It's not like that... It's just that... I've lost the person that I relied on, and I don't want to rely on others. That's all.
Chouji: #Traveler, if you've got family you're looking for, you should be able to understand me, right?
Traveler: Loneliness is inevitable.
Chouji: Well... That makes a lot of sense. I'll keep it in mind.
Chouji: Okay, I won't keep you any longer. I wish you a safe journey.
Chouji: Soon, I will head out on my own journey...
Paimon: Safe travels to you too, Chouji!
Traveler: But we should also cherish the reliable partners we find.
Traveler: I'll lend a hand.

## Talk 4

Chouji: Thank you, these will do!
Paimon: Alright then, time to tell us where the treasure is.
Chouji: Okay. The treasure is just next to the mine. You'll find it, easy-peasy.
Paimon: #Thanks! C'mon, Traveler, let's go!

## Talk 5

Chouji: You're back!
Paimon: Hmph, you little liar!
Traveler: You little liar!
Chouji: Ugh... Oh, I'll be honest with you. We're a mining family, so we were already very poor. And now that all these things have happened, life's gotten even harder...
Chouji: I'm just a poor boy from a poor family. I've never seen a large sum of Mora in my life...
Chouji: Those things I gave you are the only precious treasures I have...
Paimon: Huh...
Traveler: Well, if I may ask...
Chouji: Go on...
Traveler: How much do 30 pieces of crystal cost...?
Chouji: 1.8 million Mora!
Traveler: And he says he's never, ever seen a large sum of Mora...
Chouji: Well, see... It's not like what you think!
Chouji: I... I can really only give you this much...
Paimon: *sigh* You...
Traveler: Paimon, you tell him.
Paimon: Kids should act like kids! They shouldn't be learning all these bad behaviors from grown-ups...
Chouji: I'm not a kid anymore!
Traveler: So is that why you learned how to scam people like the grown-ups do?
Chouji: I... But...
Paimon: You must have seen grown-ups lie and cheat to make money, and to manipulate others to do as they wish, right?
Chouji: ...
Paimon: But those are terrible people... They only know how to satisfy themselves by hurting other people.
Paimon: You don't wanna hurt other people, do you?
Paimon: Paimon doesn't know what you've experienced...
Paimon: But that's terrible behavior! No one likes being cheated or used!
Traveler: Especially greedy, simple-minded people.
Paimon: #Yeah! Especially... Hey... Who are you talking about, Traveler?
Paimon: Hmph, come on, Paimon was talking! Anyway, if you really need help, we'll think of ways to help you.
Paimon: But you shouldn't cheat people like that, you understand?
Traveler: You'd make a good teacher, Paimon.
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon's learned a thing or three from traveling with you, don't ya think?
Chouji: ...Okay, I got it.
Paimon: Really?
Chouji: Yup. I won't lie to you anymore... but...
Chouji: But will you really help me?
Traveler: As long as you really do need help.
Paimon: Only if you stop scamming people!
Chouji: Okay... Then I won't waste any more of your time, I guess.
Chouji: See you again. Have a safe trip!
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon wonders if he really took in a word we said.
Traveler: So long as the compensation's fair.
Traveler: You've got quite the appetite, huh?
Traveler: There's no treasure, is there?

## Talk 6

Chouji: Hmmm... You don't seem to have had that much experience in the kitchen, but the food's still really good. Thank you!
Paimon: #Hmph, Traveler's culinary skill needs no praise! Hey, save some for Paimon!

## Talk 7

Chouji: Wow, didn't expect to see you again. Hello there!
Chouji: Are you here to buy crystals today, too?
Traveler: #Just call me Traveler, kiddo.
Chouji: #Okay, Traveler!
Chouji: Come have a look at today's crystals. These were supposed to go straight to Tatarasuna!
Chouji: You won't be disappointed, trust me!
Traveler: I think I'll pass...
Paimon: Fool Paimon twice, shame on Paimon!
Chouji: Hehe~
Paimon: Geez, this kid is awful!
Traveler: So you've been selling ore alone here this whole time?
Chouji: Yeah! I grew up, and started making Mora! Only kids are scared of being alone.
Paimon: But didn't you that say your parents are here too?
Chouji: Yup. They're somewhere safe...
Paimon: Huh, is that so...
Traveler: (Paimon, it's best not to ask.)
Chouji: #So, Traveler, you promised to help me before, didn't you?
Traveler: That's right.
Chouji: #Could you... mine some more crystals for me, Traveler?
Traveler: Which you'll then sell at a high price, I trust?
Chouji: Yeah...
Paimon: Eh, what are we now, free labor?
Chouji: N—No, it's not like that... I just...
Chouji: I really do need Mora...
Traveler: And what do you need that Mora for?
Chouji: Well, I've got various reasons. Which I'll tell you for sure, don't you worry! I just need you to help me out, please?
Traveler: Alright...
Chouji: Okay, thank you so much! I'll be waiting right here!
Traveler: We'd like to hear your explanation all the same.
Traveler: Well, don't we all...
Traveler: What do you need?
Traveler: Well, how've you been?
Chouji: Not bad. Thanks for your concern!
Traveler: This island seems rather deserted...
Chouji: It used to be pretty lively on the island, but ever since the war started, everyone's moved out... even the mine's all empty now.
Chouji: Some moved north, others went south, and no one's come back yet... It's so quiet now.
Chouji: But that's not necessarily a bad thing, huh? It's annoying with too many little kiddos around, and I'm not a kid anymore... I mean, adults should look after themselves and make their own fun, right?

## Talk 8

Chouji: #Oh, Traveler, you're back. Did you bring the crystals?
Traveler: Yeah, I've got them.
Traveler: They'll be here.
Chouji: No hurry, stay safe now!

## Talk 9

Chouji: #Hello, Traveler! How've you been?
Paimon: Paimon's been great, and you?
Traveler: You stole my line!
Paimon: Haha, that's 'cause you're too slow!
Traveler: Paimon, gunning for an extra meal, are you?
Paimon: Of course. Paimon could always go for an extra meal!
Traveler: You misunderstand. I mean you're the extra meal.
Paimon: Hey now!
Chouji: Pfft... Hahaha!
Chouji: All right, all right, you guys, please stop fighting.
Chouji: I'm doing fine. But I'd like to ask you for another favor.
Traveler: Sure, shoot. What is it?
Chouji: #Well, it's nothing special. I just need you to help me get some more crystals, Traveler.
Chouji: Believe me, I'll reward you for your help... As long as you trust me.
Traveler: I trust you, but...
Chouji: But...?
Traveler: Why?
Paimon: Right. We still don't know why you need so much Crystal Marrow!
Chouji: Well... I need money to travel so that I can find my mother, so I need to trade the crystals for money.
Traveler: But the Shogunate has monopolized the crystal market.
Chouji: I know, but I'll find my own way!
Traveler: You're playing a dangerous game here.
Chouji: ...
Paimon: We're friends, aren't we, Chouji?
Paimon: Maybe we can help you again, just like last time!
Paimon: Besides, you promised that you'd reward us. So we have the right to know about things that might endanger your and thus affect our reward, right?
Traveler: What a mercenary philosophy...
Chouji: Pfft... Paimon's right, though.
Chouji: I don't collect crystal entirely for money.
Chouji: I've been thinking... What if Mom and Dad get the disease caused by the Tatarigami, just like everyone else?
Chouji: Maybe these crystals can be used to make medicine. They grew from the bones of the giant serpent, after all...
Chouji: And Mr. Yasumoto also mentioned that these crystals may be useful.
Paimon: But you can't be sure if that's correct, can you?
Chouji: Maybe not, but we don't have anything else to go on.
Chouji: When I find Mom... or maybe even Dad, I'll take them to Sumeru. People say that they've got cure for this strange disease there.
Chouji: Before that, I can't give up any hope of finding a treatment.
Chouji: Well, I've said enough. Still want to help me?
Traveler: Do you even need to ask?
Chouji: Thank you! I won't forget this!
Traveler: I hope you can make good use of the crystals.
Traveler: I'm worried about your safety.
Traveler: You know that these crystals aren't easy to sell, don't you?
Traveler: You promised to give me an explanation.
Traveler: I'll see what I can do.

## Talk 10

Chouji: Thank you! That should be enough.
Paimon: So, where's that explanation we wanted?
Chouji: Uhh... What explanation?
Traveler: What do you need the Mora for?
Chouji: I wanna leave this island.
Chouji: People either left or got sick... There aren't many people on Yashiori Island anymore.
Chouji: ...I don't want to have to fight every day. I don't want to be surrounded by all this Tatarigami... I wanna get away from here. Leave this island.
Traveler: And what about your parents?
Paimon: Yeah, are you going to leave your parents alone here?
Chouji: Like I said... They're in a safe place.
Chouji: #...Traveler, could we talk about this unhappy stuff later?
Chouji: Haha, don't worry. I won't run away.
Chouji: #How about this then... If you've got time, Traveler, you should come over to my place. We can continue our talk there!
Paimon: Hey! Don't just leave! We haven't said anything yet!
Paimon: This kid is so presumptuous!
Traveler: What do you need those crystals for?

## Talk 11

Chouji: #Traveler! I didn't think you'd actually come...
Traveler: So, is this your home?
Chouji: How is it? Not bad, huh?
Chouji: Oh, I'm so sorry! I invited you to my house, but I forgot to cook... Sorry, that's my bad.
Chouji: Not that I've got much left now other than Lavender Melon...
Chouji: I'm used to eating those, but I can't just serve them to guests...
Chouji: Well, just a moment, please. I'll go collect some ingredients so that I can make something for you.
Paimon: Well, Paimon's not waiting around for that. We'll come along and help!
Chouji: But you're my guests. I...
Traveler: It's fine. I'm used to helping.
Chouji: Okay. So, here's my family recipe for Imported Poultry. Please have a look.
Chouji: This dish was originally taught to us by Xavier, who's an outlander in the Shogunate. According to him, it's well-suited to miners who need to replenish their energy!
Chouji: We've got enough Lavender Melon at home, so you don't have to give me any of those. We've got Wheat, too, which can be ground into Flour.
Chouji: But since we're going to make a poultry dish, we need some Fowl. We'll also need some Bird Eggs as a side dish.
Chouji: #They aren't rare ingredients, but with the current conditions on Yashiori Island... If you don't mind, Traveler, please help me gather these ingredients.
Chouji: Sorry for troubling you like this. You're supposed to be my guests...
Paimon: Come on, it's fine! No need to be so polite!
Traveler: Just a little exercise before the meal.
Traveler: Gotta say, I'm a little peckish...
Paimon: *rumble*...Paimon's hungry too...

## Talk 12

Chouji: #Traveler, you're back. Did you bring any Crystal Marrow back?
Traveler: Yes, I did.
Traveler: I'm on my way.
Chouji: Take your time. You can take a rest here too if you like.

## Talk 13

Chouji: What we'll need is some *Flour*, *Fowl*, and *Bird Eggs*. Just ask me any time if you forget!

## Talk 14

Chouji: This should be enough Crystal Marrow. Now it's time to start my adventure!
Paimon: Paimon's still worried about this kid...
Traveler: Take care of yourself now!
Chouji: Yeah!
Paimon: Hey, Chouji, you'd better stop running your mouth! You should feel lucky that you met us... otherwise, you'd get beaten up!
Paimon: Also, in case any bad guys want to fish for any information from you, be sure not to tell them the truth! Make up a story!
Paimon: And also...
Traveler: Paimon's turning into a naggy old granny.
Paimon: Anyone would be worried if a little kid like him went out on an adventure all by himself!
Traveler: I have faith in him.
Paimon: ...Hmph, sure you do.
Chouji: Hahahaha! Thank you, thank you both!
Chouji: I hope we'll meet again.
Paimon: Promise Paimon that you'll stay safe...
Chouji: I'll be fine!
Chouji: Next, I'll head to Tatarasuna, where Mom used to work. Maybe someone can tell me if she's been there.
Chouji: And then... I'll try to go to Narukami Island and travel to Snezhnaya via merchant ship. After that, I'll just see how things go.
Paimon: ...
Traveler: Do you know what you're talking about?
Chouji: If no one went on adventures because they didn't know all the risks... Well, there wouldn't be any adventurers in the world, would there?
Paimon: Ugh, this kid is sooo irritating...
Traveler: Alright then...
Chouji: Hahaha, don't you worry about me!
Chouji: #You guys have a safe trip! By the way, Traveler, I hope that you can find your family soon, too!
Paimon: Yup! Thank you!
Traveler: Just be careful.
Traveler: Do you understand the risks you're taking?
Traveler: Keep in touch!

## Talk 15

Chouji: #Hey there, Traveler, I didn't expect I'd see you again!
Paimon: Long time no see! How's the world outside of Yashiori Island?
Chouji: It's a lot wealthier than my hometown. They have a lot of good food and fun things to do. But... I can't say that I really like it.
Paimon: Oh? Why's that?
Chouji: The people here all seem to be missing something...
Chouji: When we used to live in Yashiori Island, Her Excellency was a distant yet calming presence to us... We didn't care where she was, but we believed that she was right there, watching us, protecting us, deciding how we should live our lives and what kind of people we should become...
Chouji: But here, Her Excellency covers everything and oppresses everything...
Chouji: *sigh* I'm not really sure how to put it...
Chouji: By the way, have you found anything concerning my mother?
Traveler: We're still trying.
Chouji: It's okay. Tell me when you have any news.

## Talk 16

Traveler: We found a letter.
Paimon: Read it yourself...
Chouji: Well... Okay...
Chouji: I'll read it.
Traveler: You might find her selfish...
Traveler: But please don't blame her.
Chouji: ...I understand.
Chouji: But I'll keep looking for her. Only when I find her can any of these things have meaning.
Paimon: This child... is so stubborn.

## Talk 17

Chouji: #Traveler, you're back!
Chouji: All right, let's not dilly-dally any longer. Let's make us some Imported Poultry!
Paimon: Hooray for Imported Poultry!
Traveler: Hooray for Imported Poultry!
Chouji: Hooray for Imported Poultry!
Chouji: Haha, alright. Now, let me introduce the recipe to you!
Traveler: Just some simple instructions will do.
Chouji: You see, it's that simple!
Traveler: You're a pretty talented cook, Chouji.
Paimon: Paimon didn't know you were such a good cook, either! Ooh, Paimon's stomach is already rumbling just listening to those instructions.
Chouji: Well, this is the recipe my mom taught me. It's her signature dish.
Chouji: Hehe, let's try and make it, shall we?
Chouji: My mom always used to teach me to cook. This is the first time that I'm teaching someone else!
Chouji: #Traveler, you're a great adventurer, right? I'm sure this Imported Poultry is just a piece of cake for you!
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon's mad now, he's looking down on us!
Paimon: C'mon, we'll show him!
Traveler: Tell me everything!
Chouji: This dish is very easy to make! First, let's cut the Lavender Melon and boil it in water. Then, we crack the Bird Eggs and beat them.
Chouji: If you're confident enough with a knife, you can cut the melons into any shape you like!
Chouji: Next, put the Fowl on the chopping board and slice it down the middle into thick pieces. Then, we need to marinate it for a while...
Chouji: After that, we'll dredge the sliced Fowl through the flour... If there's too much flour, remember to pat it off. Then, we coat the Fowl evenly using the beaten eggs.
Chouji: Heat the oil — and don't forget to use a chopstick to test the temperature. You'll know it's ready once you see small bubbles gushing up from the chopstick.
Chouji: Then, put the slices that have been wrapped in flour into the pan and deep fry them for, um, three to four minutes. Turn the heat up until the skin turns golden, and then you can take them out.
Chouji: Don't heat the oil too much, or else it'll be overcooked. But if it's not hot enough, the oil will seep into the skin and make it soft, which will make it taste horrible.
Chouji: Take the deep-fried Fowl out and put it on top of paper to soak up the extra oil. Then cut it into strips.
Chouji: Finally, decorate it with lavender melon, add some homemade sauce... and we're done!

## Talk 18

Chouji: Hello, we meet again!
Paimon: Wait a minute. Let Paimon guess what you're about to say...
Traveler: "Please get me more Crystal Marrow..."
Paimon: "Paimon needs them urgently, boo hoo..."
Traveler: That's what you are going to say, right!
Chouji: Hahaha, of course not!
Traveler: How have your travels been going?
Chouji: Good. But I still haven't found any trace of my Mom...
Paimon: #It doesn't matter. We'll help you, too, right, Traveler?
Traveler: We'll do our best.
Chouji: #Mm! I knew I could rely on you, Traveler!

## Talk 19

Chouji: #Woohoo! Alright then, Traveler, you can start now!

## Talk 20

Chouji: Anyway. Thank you for your help! See you around!

## Talk 21

Chouji: #Mm~mm! That's yummy! Traveler, you have the potential to become a famous chef!
Paimon: #Wow, it smells good! You know what, Traveler, why don't we just open a gourmet kiosk here?
Paimon: Paimon's being serious!

## Talk 22

Traveler: We found a letter.
Paimon: Read it yourself...
Chouji: Well... Okay...
Chouji: I'll read it.
Traveler: You might find her selfish...
Traveler: But please don't blame her.
Chouji: ...I understand.
Chouji: But I'll keep looking for her. Only when I find her can any of these things have meaning.
Paimon: This child... is so stubborn.

## Talk 23

Chouji: Thank you. I haven't had this dish for a long time. My mom used to cook this for me. It was so delicious... no one could make it as well as her.
Chouji: Well, now I wish I wasn't stuck eating lavender melon every day. I wish I could eat poultry dishes every day.
Paimon: Paimon too!
Traveler: If you ate this every day...
Chouji: I wouldn't if it was cooked by my mom.
Chouji: ...
Chouji: I'm working hard to save money so that I can leave Yashiori Island, try more delicious food, and make yummy dishes for more people!
Chouji: It's said that only one round-trip route to Snezhnaya is still open in Ritou... Maybe I still have a chance.
Chouji: The grown-ups say that as long as I have enough Mora, even the Commissioner will let us go out to sea.
Traveler: Why did you change the subject?
Chouji: ...
Chouji: She left.
Paimon: Oh...
Traveler: I'm sorry...
Chouji: It's okay. You must be curious, I know.
Chouji: Ten days after it began to rain on the island, my mom left.
Chouji: She didn't leave me any letter or note...
Chouji: But for some reason, I already knew that she was going to leave. Especially the day when the grown-ups were setting up my dad's tombstone...
Paimon: ...
Chouji: That day, my mom was very angry. I've never seen her that angry... My mom believes that my dad's still alive. I believe that too.
Traveler: What was this place like before?
Chouji: ...You know, before the war, before the Shogunate shut down the mines... We lived happy lives.
Chouji: No one was starving. No one was poor... We'd share the food we couldn't finish with each other. Everyone would help to clean the rooms, houses... everything.
Chouji: The grown-ups all worked together in the mine, and they usually helped each other...
Chouji: #Just like how you helped me, Traveler.
Chouji: But now everyone's gone.
Paimon: ...That's why you want to leave?
Chouji: Mom should be searching for Dad... So I'm going to look for her, too.
Traveler: But where are you going to start?
Chouji: I'll start on Yashiori Island, of course. Maybe I'll go ask the doctor called Yasumoto... But I think he hates me. He always hides from me every time he sees me from a distance...
Chouji: After that, I might go look for one of my dad's co-workers... I've heard that Mr. Kaji is still on the island. He might know something about Mom.
Traveler: But there are lots of pirates out and about.
Chouji: Well... I guess I can seek help from the pirates, too... They don't get along with the grown-ups from the Shogunate, but they're nice to us.
Chouji: They might even agree to take me out to sea with them.
Chouji: And then... Well, not that man. He's scary.
Traveler: Who now?
Chouji: Washizu, the head of Higi Village. He used to be a very nice person... But now he's very strange.
Chouji: He's very scary. He always stares at my house from a distance and talks to himself. I always thought that he might do something bad to me... or to my mother.
Chouji: I hope Mom didn't bump into him.
Chouji: #Ah, speaking of Washizu... Can I ask you for one more favor, Traveler?
Traveler: I'm all ears.
Chouji: Well, Washizu built some shrines on the island way back when. They were originally meant to pacify the Serpent's soul with offerings...
Chouji: After all, we come into contact with Jakotsu Crystal all the time, and that makes people get sick after a while.
Chouji: But since the mine closed, Washizu has become weirder and scarier... The way he makes offerings at the shrine has also become more and more... crazy, I think.
Chouji: Later on, the adults who were calling Washizu's behavior crazy started disappearing one by one...
Chouji: Speaking of which, Mom used to go to the nearby shrine to pray for my dad and I. She'd offer some Sakura Bloom petals there too.
Chouji: I want to go there and see if she's left any messages for me... But I'm afraid that I might bump into Washizu, so I can't get too close.
Chouji: So... So...
Traveler: Don't worry.
Chouji: #Thank you so much, Traveler!
Traveler: I'll go check it out for you.
Traveler: Is it related to Washizu?
Traveler: Maybe she hasn't left the island yet...
Traveler: The Shogunate isn't poking their nose around these parts, are they?
Chouji: Once in a while, grown-ups from the city would come to buy ore. They liked to criticize us, too.
Chouji: But we do things our way. They have their rules in the city, and Her Excellency set rules for us as well...
Chouji: If not for the war, I would have had to participate in one of those "audits," though I don't know much about it.
Chouji: They say it's an obligation... But I don't like being with a whole group of adults. It's so boring.
Chouji: ...
Traveler: About your mother...
Traveler: You'd get sick of it.

## Talk 24

Chouji: #You're back, Traveler!
Chouji: Why don't you eat something, or drink some water?
Traveler: I'm fine. Thanks.
Chouji: Thank you!
Traveler: Let me finish your commission first.

## Talk 25

Shrine: This is probably the shrine that Chouji mentioned, huh?
Shrine: (It looks like an ordinary shrine — there is a distinct lack of any strange elemental traces.)
Traveler: Investigate
Shrine: (The shrine is simple but elegant. Its wood shimmers slightly, greeting guests and their offerings with solemn silence.)
Shrine: (Many Sacred Sakura petals lie scattered around this shrine, though it is not a natural scene. Instead, it seems more like someone intentionally scattered the Sakura Blooms here.)
Paimon: Huh... There aren't any traces here, either.
Traveler: Look, Sakura Blooms...
Paimon: Oh right. Chouji mentioned that his mom would present this offering to the shrine!
Paimon: There are so many petals here, too... This can't be a coincidence.
Paimon: Let's go back and tell him!
Traveler: It's Chouji's mother's offering...

## Talk 26

Chouji: Uh... Ahaha, I've got to say that I've never tasted such... outlandish flavors in my life.
Paimon: Outlandish flavors? More like Abyssal ones!
Paimon: Come on, Chouji, don't force yourself! You're still a kid. You don't have to eat this stuff...

## Talk 27

Chouji: Anyway. Thank you for your help! See you around!
Chouji: #Well, I don't know when I'll see you again next. I hope you'll still remember me by then, Traveler!
