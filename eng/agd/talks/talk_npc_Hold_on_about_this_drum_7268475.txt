Traveler: Hold on, about this drum...
Genta: You noticed it too, huh? Yeah, I noticed almost straight away that something wasn't quite right.
Genta: It looks exactly like the kind of toy drum I'd buy from street peddlers as a kid! I remember they only cost around 800 Mora back then.
Genta: Times change, I guess, but still. 80 grand is way too expensive.
Genta: The boss definitely got scammed, no question.
Genta: But whaddya gonna do? He's still the boss.
Genta: Are you ready for your Drumalong performance?
