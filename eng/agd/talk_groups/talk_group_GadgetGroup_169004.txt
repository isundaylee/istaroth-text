Hornshroom Augury Ad: "O visitor from afar, have your eyes grown dim? Have you lost your way? Come into the Hornshroom Augury, and I will lead you to your answer."
Silken Handwriting: "Master Chicomexochitl, I am a merchant from Fontaine. I would like to ask you: Where should I go to find personal happiness?"
Hornshroom Augury: "Chase not a vague remoteness, but stop and gaze around you. Happiness may be found there, glimmering brightly like gold."
Silken Handwriting: "Thank you so much, Master Chicomexochitl. I understand now — the Mora gleaming in my pocket here is the source of my happiness! Indeed, it was right beside me all along..."
Hornshroom Augury: "Even though any normal person could see that's not the point I'm trying to make... I'm still glad that you're happy."

Silken Handwriting: "Master Chicome, it's me again. I'm a merchant from Fontaine, but I never feel like I have enough Mora. How can I get more Mora than I can spend?"
Hornshroom Augury: "As the ancient sages say, be ye not the Saurian who lusts after unrighteous wealth... (The subsequent text has been randomly crossed out)."
Hornshroom Augury: "No, wait! I'm a fortune-teller. What do you take me for, an investment bank? Could you please be a little more down-to-earth here?"
Silken Handwriting: "Earth, eh... I see, I see. What you're saying is that I should invest in geological and mining ventures, yes? I get it now."
Hornshroom Augury: "Hang on. I never said that! Don't take me so literally each time!"
Silken Handwriting: "I'm here to keep my promise! Thank you so much, Master Chicome! I made a mint this time — you truly are a most efficacious sage! I'll be back with more earnest inquiries for sure!"

Message: "Praise Master Ixim! The phlogiston pattern you drew is incredible. I've finally become popular! As soon as I got back to Fontaine, lots of people thronged around me!"
Ixim's Message: "Err, thank you very much for the compliment. But I don't recall drawing you anything like that. Are you sure this is connected to me?
Message: "Why, of course, it's related to you — as soon as I got off the aquabus, I disrobed and displayed the pattern you drew to all. Forget humans — even the Gardemeks started chasing after me!"
Message: "Good thing I'm a fast runner and didn't let them take advantage of me! *sigh* Seems like being famous is a real hassle, too..."
Ixim's Message: "That's... How should I put this? I think this has nothing at all to do with the phlogiston pattern, and in any case, you really shouldn't be taking your clothes off in public spaces..."

Full 3-Page Long Guarantee: "I, Samil, am well aware that touching the feathers of a meditating Iktomisaurus without permission is a serious offense indeed..."
Full 3-Page Long Guarantee: "...I hope everyone learns from my experience, and will not fiddle with the wings of Saurian whelp out of curiosity — and definitely not try to feed them any Jueyun Chilis..."
Full 3-Page Long Guarantee: "...Thank you, Elder Tlapopoctiztetl, for not minding my behavior and for not having me expelled..."
Tepano's Message: "And please everybody: Do not disturb Saurian whelps while they rest. Nor should you touch them willy-nilly, like Mr. Samil did."
Tepano's Message: "If you want to learn more about saurian whelp habits, you can ask Explorer Ororon."
Tepano's Message: "Also: Ororon is just really into his herbal medicine research. He is not a greengrocer."

Claricia's Message: "Hello everyone! I'm a traveling painter from Mondstadt. Does anyone have any paint recommendations — you know, the kind that gives that gilded golden finish... I hear it's called phlogiston or something?"
Someone's Message: "Phlogiston engraving, eh... It's not enough to have the paint for that. There's also a special brush you'll need to buy. I personally recommend a brush made of Qucusaurus feathers. It's durable and cheap."
Claricia's Message: "Okay! I'll go get a brush!"
Another Person's Message: "Just buying a brush isn't enough either. What are you going to use to store the phlogiston? This stuff won't last very long without a receptacle..."
Someone's Message: "That's a good point. The palette will also need to be crafted from special materials..."
Claricia's Message: "Okay, thank you, everyone! I bought all the stuff. So... What about the paint? What kind of paint should I buy?
