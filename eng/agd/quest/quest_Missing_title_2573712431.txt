## Talk 1

Moce: Stay on your guard, citizen!
Traveler: What are you doing?
Moce: Me? It is as you see. I am busy dealing with the barbarian threat! They have been stepping up their attacks — perhaps they might even have sent spies!
Moce: This is no trivial matter! Vigilance must be maintained until reinforcements arrive!
Moce: If there is anything else, please bring it up with my adjutant, citizen.
Traveler: A child, out here on their own...
Moce: Hmm? A child? Where from? Did some new legionnaire disobey orders and bring their family into the camp again...?
Moce: *sigh* Dominus Cassiodor is far too gentle with these greenhorns. If this were to have happened three decades prior, a Tribunus would've had a whip out by now...
Traveler: Have there been any suspicious happenings lately?
Moce: Not at present. That said, the barbarians are akin to cunning beasts. Ever will they strike when your guard has been lowered, for surprise is their greatest weapon!
Moce: By methods most foul they infiltrate our cities and seek out our secrets. Even the slightest lapse in discipline may lead to catastrophe.
Moce: *sigh* Thirty years ago, when I followed Dominus Boethius to conquest in the far north, they were but a pack of primitives without any such skill for subterfuge. Where did they learn these tricks?
Traveler: Thirty years ago... Your parents wouldn't even have been born yet...
Moce: Hmm? What did you just say, citizen? I fear my hearing's been going as I age.
Moce: *sigh* Time truly is cruel. During the conquest of Bituria, I could hear the barbarians' bells calling them to muster from miles away.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Moce: Fare ye well, citizen! You may report suspicious people to me at any time!

## Talk 2

Giovanni: *sigh* I wonder when this war will finally be over...
Traveler: What are you doing up there on the roof?
Giovanni: Hmmm? I'm monitoring the area for any suspicious barbarian activity, of course! Recently... Wait a moment. How did you get up this watchtower, citizen?
Traveler: That's my line, really...
Giovanni: *sigh* Whatever, that isn't important. Tribunus Mettius says that the savages' assaults are advancing apace. The latest news is that they might have sent spies among us. We must be on guard.
Giovanni: But would those brutes really be interested in our remote little city? To the extent that they would go through all the trouble of sending spies?
Traveler: Meat is meat, no matter how small the portion.
Giovanni: Ah, citizen, you speak true! It seems I must keep to my task. Hmm... Judging by how you spoke, might you be experienced in such matters?
Giovanni: In which case, could I entreat you to survey the surrounding area? Should the barbarians have been active, they must have left some trail. Like a wooden sword, perhaps...
Traveler: Uh, like kids play-fighting?
Giovanni: Well now, they *are* savages. Would it be so strange that they would use sticks as weapons?
Giovanni: In any case, I am counting on you. Should you discover anything, report back to me — consider it your joyous duty as a Remurian.

## Talk 3

Giovanni: Have you made any discoveries, citizen?
Traveler: I found a few...
Traveler: It's nothing.
Giovanni: Stay safe! Report to me should anything arise!

## Talk 4

Giovanni: To think that... There can be no mistake. This is one of the barbarians' signal poles, by which they send their vile messages!
Traveler: You sure about that?
Giovanni: *sigh* I cannot believe that their spies truly have infiltrated our ranks. It seems Tribunus Mettius's fears were not unfounded.
Giovanni: Once I report this matter to him, I will have discharged my duty.
Giovanni: You have my thanks regardless, citizen. If not for you, our defenses might have collapsed well before the heathen hordes arrived!
Giovanni: I will surely mention your contribution when making my report.
Traveler: You said it was a wooden sword just now...
