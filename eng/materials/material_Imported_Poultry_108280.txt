# Imported Poultry

A meat dish drizzled with sauce. The fowl is marinated before being covered in batter and fried, and a thick sauce is drizzled over it as a finishing touch. The accompanying vegetables are local produce, but the marinating methods and sauce are all imported, hence the name "imported poultry."
