Traveler: Read the third letter
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: Well, well, wasn't this quite the day?
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: I tried to investigate the people who had dealings with this Puppy Union as much as I could, and I found two main, hidden sources of funding.
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: One is the Foreign Trade Association. In fact, the Union could be considered a subsidiary of the former.
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: You may not be aware of the particulars regarding said Union, but they are closely connected to Sangonomiya.
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: The second source is more interesting still. You'd never guess, but it's Komore Teahouse, and of course... the Yashiro Commission isn't far behind the curtain.
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: A fascinating turn of events, no? Sangonomiya and the Yashiro Commission... I wonder what your little secret is?
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: I have my guesses, but I'll need more evidence to prove it â€” details of deals regarding pets.
Letter With Elegant Handwriting: We should have records of such things at the Police Station. I'll get in touch with Yoriki Owada.
