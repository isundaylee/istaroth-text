# A Gifted Rose: Ballad of Days Gone By


## Talk 1

Black Screen Text: After you wait in silence for some time, young shoots slowly emerge from the soil...

## Talk 2

Affan: You're here.
Affan: This must be the person you found to help me, right? I said something harsh to her just a few days ago...
Affan: I'm really... *sigh* I'm old and useless.
Sabbah: Aren't we having a friendly chat right now? Don't take it to heart, sir.
Traveler: Have the seeds germinated?
Sabbah: Mr. Affan and I went to take a look, and they haven't, unfortunately.
Sabbah: Based on my observations, these seeds appear to have gone through petrifaction. There are two possible reasons for this:
Sabbah: The first possibility is that they lost all possibility of growth after a long period of natural weathering and have thus transformed into a petrified state.
Sabbah: If this is the case, the seeds will be unable to germinate. However, the probability of this hypothesis proving true is low.
Sabbah: It takes a very long time for petrifaction to take place, and these seeds do not meet that time requirement.
Sabbah: The second possibility is that this breed has a strong affinity for Geo.
Sabbah: That is to say that they can gather enough Geo elements while in seed form to form a stony shell over their exteriors.
Sabbah: If the above hypothesis is true, this means that these seeds can be preserved for a long time.
Paimon: Paimon... Paimon doesn't really get it. Are you saying that the seeds have turned to stone?
Affan: So they're stones, huh? Then I suppose all hope is lost. Golden Roses can't grow from stones.
Sabbah: Golden Rose? Do you refer to the Golden Rose that the folk song sings of?
Affan: Oh, you probably don't know about this. The village has a rose folk song that has been passed down, and it was originally composed by Uncle Shafaqat.
Affan: He taught the folk song he composed to the generation before me, and they taught it to their own children.
Affan: There are already people in my generation who have never heard of this song, and when our generation is gone, no one will remember him anymore.
Affan: "Rose, oh roses, grant me my wish."
Affan: "Blooming from the stone, the Golden Rose sang to me."
Sabbah: That's right... We can make the stones bloom!
Traveler: Did you think of something, Sabbah?
Sabbah: As the song hinted, perhaps breaking the stone shell will let the seeds sprout from the stones.
Sabbah: Normally, an ideal planting environment needs to be created to awaken the seeds and let them break through the seed casing on their own.
Sabbah: But this rose breed has a seed casing that is too hard for the sprout to break through. So we can try lending them a hand instead.
Sabbah: Is this fine with you, Mr. Affan?
Affan: Do you mean to break the seeds open by force?
Sabbah: Obviously, we're not going to completely smash the seeds. We have to get someone nimble to do this.
Sabbah: #{NICKNAME}, can you do it?
Traveler: Doing the dirty work again...
Sabbah: You must be careful. Use <color=#00E1FFFF>Blunt Attacks</color> to break the seed casings first, then use the power of <color=#00E1FFFF>Dendro</color> to awaken the seeds.
Traveler: I'm on it.

## Talk 3

Black Screen Text: After you wait in silence for some time, young shoots slowly emerge from the soil...
Paimon: Wow, Sabbah's method really worked!
Affan: They're finally sprouting! Finally...
Sabbah: Looks like Mr. Shafaqat's wish can finally be fulfilled after all.
Sabbah: Mr. Affan, you told me before that this breed of rose is something that he cultivated.
Sabbah: To be able to cultivate a new species, he must have been a researcher who was exiled here, just like me, right?
Affan: Yes... He was exiled to this village, and he lived in the house behind us his whole life.
Sabbah: I see. That's probably how all of us exiles will end up.
Sabbah: Speaking of which, cultivating new species is something only the top researchers can do.
Sabbah: It's a great pity that a person like him faded into nameless obscurity so far away from the Akademiya.
Paimon: Are you thinking about your own future as well...
Traveler: Keep your chin up.
Affan: Yes, child. You still have a long way to go, and lots of things to do.
Affan: Don't be trapped in melancholy. I don't want to see a second old ghost.
Sabbah: You're right. I shouldn't be getting all melancholic at a happy time like this. Let's get back on topic.
Sabbah: These Golden Roses have only just sprouted. They have yet to bloom. I want to keep watching over them until they bloom. How about you all?
Traveler: Same here.
Sabbah: Let's give them more time to absorb more nutrients. We'll reconvene later and watch them bloom.
Unknown NPC (PLAYER): (I'm not sure how we can console Sabbah...)
Affan: Don't be sad. Look, in the end, he still managed to leave us the Golden Rose.
Affan: They are the proof that Uncle Shafaqat once existed in this world.

## Talk 4

Affan: "Rose, oh roses, grant me my wish."
Affan: "Blooming from the stone, the Golden Rose sang to me."
Affan: "She sang:"
Affan: "No land but folk songs bore my spirit."
Affan: "Songs shall defy my fate, and overcome my destiny."
Affan: "They will surpass me, surpass time. They will surpass the ever-lasting withering of life."
Affan: This is the song Uncle Shafaqat taught us.

## Talk 5

Sabbah: Try using <color=#00E1FFFF>Blunt Attacks</color> to break the petrified seed casings, then use the power of <color=#00E1FFFF>Dendro</color> to awaken the seeds.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: This is a Sumeru Rose that I picked.
Sabbah: How I miss this sight... Here, your presents are ready too. Please, take them.
Sabbah: They're all seeds of plants that won't grow here. If you have a yard somewhere else, you can watch them mature there.

### Additional Talk 2

Sabbah: Here for a chat? I've been wanting to talk to somebody.

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: Which Darshan were you with, by the way?
Sabbah: Oh, I could talk for three whole days about that!
Sabbah: I was with Amurta and specialized in plant evolution, so you could say my work was evidence-based.
Sabbah: That means it is impossible to reach new conclusions without new forms of evidence. Simply put, fossils are necessary for the study of historical plants.
Sabbah: But there are only so many fossil samples available, and the Akademiya is limited in its ability to provide new ones.
Sabbah: Those were the circumstances, yet the institute still demanded results.
Sabbah: So some people would just take a previous study, revise or add something to it, and turn it in. You also find that quite pointless, right?
Sabbah: In truth, we could make new discoveries for sure if we looked towards history and geography for new materials.
Sabbah: Certain literary documents that Amurta would usually ignore could be used as well, though that would surely cross into Vahumana and Haravatat territory.
Sabbah: I was not proficient in those fields, and requesting the related files was too troublesome, never mind working with their researchers...
Sabbah: But I believe that if we could actually work together as a team, many questions of the past would finally be answered.
Sabbah: It's a shame that we couldn't continue our collaboration attempts. I must say that people in Vahumana and Haravatat have very peculiar perspectives, though...
Sabbah: I had to be very careful with my wording and phrasing in my submissions to them to avoid misunderstandings and misinterpretations.
Sabbah: Before I was kicked out of the Akademiya, I was still in the middle of an argument with someone from Haravatat. Now I can't even do that...
Sabbah: Ah, I just rambled for a long time... But it feels good.
Sabbah: Before you got here, I really didn't have many friends, and it could get pretty lonely.
Sabbah: Very few people in the village are into gardening.
Sabbah: ...Well, that's not entirely true. An old man living to the north of the village also plowed a plot to grow flowers.
Sabbah: I've visited him before. He's a slightly eccentric old man.
Sabbah: I saw him planting stones, but he insisted that they were flowers, and even kicked me out.
Sabbah: It must be lonely, living all by himself. I can understand that.
Sabbah: You helped me with my Sumeru Roses... Maybe you can help him with his plants too.
Sabbah: You and Paimon should visit him if you get a chance.

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: How's life in Aaru Village?
Sabbah: It's alright. I have food and a roof over my head. All the essential things in life are taken care of.
Sabbah: I was banished, after all, so I can't dream of having books and research instruments here.
Sabbah: This place has been used as exiled scholars' banishing grounds for quite a while. Life is hard and practical here, so naturally, no one here is interested in academics or research.
Sabbah: I'm certainly not the first exile, and probably won't be the last.
Sabbah: All I can do is to learn to live with it.
Sabbah: Ah, I just rambled for a long time... But it feels good.
Sabbah: Before you got here, I really didn't have many friends, and it could get pretty lonely.
Sabbah: Very few people in the village are into gardening.
Sabbah: ...Well, that's not entirely true. An old man living to the north of the village also plowed a plot to grow flowers.
Sabbah: I've visited him before. He's a slightly eccentric old man.
Sabbah: I saw him planting stones, but he insisted that they were flowers, and even kicked me out.
Sabbah: It must be lonely, living all by himself. I can understand that.
Sabbah: You helped me with my Sumeru Roses... Maybe you can help him with his plants too.
Sabbah: You and Paimon should visit him if you get a chance.

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: About Affan...
Sabbah: Hmm? Did something happen?
Black Screen Text: You tell Sabbah about the difficulties Affan has encountered.
Sabbah: I see, so that's why you have come to me for help.
Sabbah: I'm honored that I am the one you thought of when something like this came up.
Sabbah: That said, I did not specialize in plant cultivation, and my experience is limited. I'm not sure that I'll be of much help.
Sabbah: Still, I will try my best. The gentleman you mentioned who cultivated a new species of rose also interests me.
Sabbah: I will visit Mr. Affan's nursery when I have some time. You can look for me there later.

### Additional Talk 6

Affan: I'm sorry, Uncle Shafaqat. I wasn't able to fulfill your last wish...
Traveler: Who's Shafaqat?
Affan: Ah yes, you children were pestering me about the old ghost, weren't you? Well, that's not his real name. I mean, who would actually be called that?
Affan: I heard from my elders that his name was Shafaqat. He left Sumeru City when he was young and came to our village.
Affan: He built this house after arriving here and lived in it by himself, and for decades, he barely left.
Affan: I've never seen him as a young man, but they say that he didn't really dislike children at that time.
Affan: He grew many trees and flowers in the front and back yard of his house. Children liked to run over to his place and ask for Ajilenakh Nuts, and also to listen to him talk.
Affan: But by the time I met him, he'd already become old and was called the old ghost, and he'd also come to dislike children.
Traveler: There must be another way.
Affan: What other way can there be?
Affan: Uncle Shafaqat... That old geezer's already passed away in peace. If he was still alive, I could ask him what special methods could be used to cultivate these roses.
Affan: Who can I ask now?
Traveler: I know an Amurta researcher named Sabbah.
Affan: Oh, you mean that outsider girl. Can she help?
Affan: Besides, she came by here before and I drove her away. Will she still be willing to help?
Traveler: I'll give it a shot.
Affan: You're a good kid. It's alright if you can't find anyone to help. The thought is enough for me.
Traveler: Why are you so obsessed with growing flowers?
Affan: Once in a while, some outsiders would be forced to settle here in our village.
Affan: Some people never got used to living here, even if they kept pushing themselves to do so, and so they ended up alone for the rest of their lives.
Affan: That old geezer Uncle Shafaqat was probably one of them. Everyone just accepted this state of affairs over time.
Affan: But no matter how many years passed, I refused to get used to such a thing. It's really such a pity, what happened to him...
Affan: You would have loved his garden too if you ever saw it. Pretty flowers of all kinds of colors, and so many trees of varying heights...
Affan: The person who cultivated such a great garden passed away so quietly. And the only thing people would remember about him now is that the old ghost would take away naughty children.
Affan: I refuse to accept this. He wrote in his notes that he wanted these roses to grow everywhere. And I want to fulfill his wish.
Affan: I'm old anyway, so I don't care how others may see me. My life will be worth it if I can do this.
Affan: I've cleaned up his house for him and sorted out the large pile of booklets he'd left behind.
Affan: I can show you a volume or two if you're interested.
Affan: I'll put these notes <color=#00E1FFFF>in front of the house</color>, just so he can see the sun for a bit through them.
