# Outrider Style


## Talk 1

Amber: There's only one way over there. Raptor must be up ahead.
Amber: However, it looks like the only way we can catch up is if we glide.
Paimon: But there's a ton of enemies below... They'll definitely attack us after we take off.
Amber: If we're gonna do this, *we'll have to glide and defeat them in one fell swoop*...
Amber: #Traveler, you still had one stage to go in your exam, right?
Paimon: Yeah, but what's that got to do with anything?
Amber: #How about we make this the third and final stage of your gliding exam, Traveler?
Paimon: Are you sure that's how the exam is supposed to go!?
Amber: #It's a custom version of the exam for Traveler, designed by yours truly!
Amber: #Besides, the normal version of the exam wouldn't be fit for the hero of Mondstadt himself!
Traveler: Watch me nail this exam.
Traveler: Watch me nail Raptor.
Amber: #So, what do you say, Traveler?
Amber: Woohoo! Good answer.
Amber: #Traveler, prepare for take-off! Raptor awaits you once you *defeat all these enemies*, then that gliding license is yours!

## Talk 2

Amber: It looks like there's no way across... Ugh, he must be around here somewhere.
Paimon: Amber, over there!
Raptor: If you insist on chasing me, so be it... Huh? Who brought the little girl?
Amber: You must be Raptor! You can't escape!
Raptor: Haha, I don't need to escape! There's no way you can make it over here.
Amber: Oh... It is pretty high... and quite far...
Raptor: Oh, little girl, why don't you run along home now and let your leader deal with this? Don't worry, I promise that once the Grand Master gets here, I'll surrender immediately! Haha!
Amber: Hey, watch it! You're talking to a Knights of Favonius Outrider! You'll be sorry when I arrest you!
Traveler: Deep breaths, Amber.
Amber: ...You're right.
Amber: Ugh... He's right there in front of us... If only we could glide across.
Paimon: So how did HE get across?
Traveler: Some sort of mechanism?
Amber: I don't see a mechanism, and I have good eyesight.
Amber: Besides, there's nowhere on the ledge that you could build one.
Raptor: Bye-bye, kiddo...
Paimon: Oh no! He's getting away!
Amber: We can't hesitate any longer. The only way to get across is to glide there.
Paimon: But... but...
Amber: Don't worry — I'm the Gliding Champion of Mondstadt, remember! If Raptor can do it, I can do it too.
Raptor: Oi, Outrider! You have less chance of surviving this than jumping off the Anemo God statue in Mondstadt without your wind glider! Haha!
Traveler: I'm with Amber.
Paimon: #Paimon sees your point Traveler... If you rule out everything that's completely impossible, gliding is the only idea left.
Amber: #Traveler, remember that book I lent you? The one I thought was the gliding manual, but wasn't?
Amber: The first birds couldn't fly. Flight was their reward for their courage to plunge into the canyon.
Amber: Be my witness.
Traveler: Go! Go! Outrider!
Amber: Roger! Let's show this guy what an Outrider is made of!
Raptor: Wait... Stop! You'll never make it! Come on, off you go now, back home like a good little girl.
Amber: Raptor says I'll never make it. But, if you listen carefully...
Amber: The wind! The wind says I WILL make it, and that's good enough for me!
Traveler: This will take some serious guts, but it's not completely impossible.
Traveler: Some kind of elemental magic?
Paimon: #Traveler, can you see anything with your Elemental Sight...? No? Oh, okay... Never mind...
Traveler: A grappling hook, or spikes, or something?
Paimon: If it's too far to glide, it's definitely too far for anything like that.
Amber: There's also no sign of an anchor point.
Traveler: Let's examine our surroundings — just like you taught me.

## Talk 3

Amber: Alright! I got him!
Amber: I only noticed the wind current from in the air — and it's the only one.
Amber: It would be suicide to try and escape in the direction Raptor was going.
Amber: In other words, the only way Raptor could have gotten out would be this way — past us.
Paimon: Aha! So he was just trying to fool us by acting smug, in the hope that we would just give up and leave.
Paimon: Little did he know, we're not so easily fooled.
Amber: #It was all thanks to Traveler's sharp thinking! Just like a wise man once said, "Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth."
Amber: At the end of the day, gliding is seven parts technique, three parts instinct — and then 90 parts courage.
Paimon: What you did now looked more like 99 parts courage...
Amber: Ah, it was just like in my first gliding exam... I was super nervous, but in the end, there was nothing to be afraid of and I passed no problem.
Amber: I kinda missed that nervous rush in the exams I've done since then... It just wasn't the same.
Paimon: ...Erm, sorry — Paimon thought you said you passed no problem? What do you mean, exams since then?
Amber: Ah... Well you see, the thing is, Mondstadt is all "no glide zone" this, "no landing zone" that...
Amber: *sigh* Every time I get my license it keeps getting revoked. I must have taken the exam about 15 times altogether...
Amber: But I always pass the first time. I guess my little gliding manual ain't so bad after all!
Paimon: #...Traveler, let's go and get a copy of the real gliding manual from Acting Grand Master Jean some time.
Traveler: Sounds good.
Amber: I'll head off first because I need to escort Raptor back to the city.
Amber: Once you're back in the city don't forget to come find me at the Cathedral. I'll issue your gliding license there.
Traveler: I feel sorry for Jean...

## Talk 4

Amber: Congratulations, here is your gliding license! You're officially legal now, yay!
Amber: I'm not surprised though, you are a natural after all.
Traveler: Yeah, it was easy.
Amber: Oh — and I'll sign you up for the next Wind Gliding Championship!
Amber: I glide so fast that no one can keep up — it's just me up there, on my own, gliding around... It's kinda boring.
Traveler: Cool. I'm definitely gonna win.
Amber: Ooh... Fighting talk! Heh. It seems you have no idea how terrifying the championship really is...
Amber: Well, until I kick your butt in the championship, I wish you a happy, liberating, and above all law-abiding gliding experience.
Amber: Make sure you obey the rules. Whatever you do, don't get your license revoked...
Paimon: Oh brother... If you ask me, that's a bit rich, coming from Amber...
Traveler: You won't stand a chance of winning if you sign me up.
Traveler: I actually put a lot of effort into this.
