Thoma: When I was little, my mother often read me bedtime stories. Back then, I thought the world was just like in those stories, and everyone led peaceful, happy lives.
Thoma: It was only later that I realized the difficulties and struggles many people face in society. All I can do is try my best, and stay loyal to the people I care about.
Thoma: Now that I think about it, even though the stories are fictional, they can still help children get a good night's sleep. To me, that's enough.
