Traveler: Tell me more about the Dendro Archon...
Gulabgir: Ah, and isn't the story of the Greater Lord the best evidence for hope?
Gulabgir: She sacrificed her power to defend the land of Sumeru from calamity.
Gulabgir: She did this so that other life, whether on land or sea, might continue to thrive.
Gulabgir: Ah... The songs that had been sung among Vanara are popping into my mind again.
Gulabgir: I should perform them again next time â€” that'll fetch me a good sum of Mora for sure. After all, who in Sumeru doesn't love the Dendro Archon?
