# The More Treasures the Merrier


## Talk 1

Marjorie: This is bad... Very bad...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Marjorie: Traveler! Just the person I needed to see. Did you know this is my souvenir shop?
Marjorie: My dad used to wait till the adventurers came back and buy their spoils of war from them to sell in the shop.
Marjorie: But since things started dying down at the Adventurers' Guild, my opportunities to stock up have been few and far between.
Marjorie: Not only that, but recently the items we get in are hardly worth anything. Nobody wants to buy them.
Marjorie: Traveler, your adventures take you all over the place, don't they? Could I trouble you to bring me back some treasures that I can sell next time?
Traveler: I'll keep my eyes peeled.
Marjorie: Thank you! Whatever you bring me, I will make sure to get a good price for.
Traveler: Actually, Paimon is worth a pretty penny.
Marjorie: I'm sorry, but nobody wants to buy that.
Marjorie: My customers tend to prefer objects of the more inanimate variety.

## Talk 2

Marjorie: Everything clear? Off you go then, I'll be waiting.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Marjorie: Hmm, I haven't given you the slightest idea of what sells well, have I? I bet you don't know what to look for.
Marjorie: Why don't you get me some <color=#00E1FFFF>loot from the hilichurls</color>.
Marjorie: I have a feeling that adventurers looking to prove their worth would be interested in that sort of thing.

### Additional Talk 2

Marjorie: Don't forget, you're looking for some <color=#00E1FFFF>loot from the hilichurls</color>.
Marjorie: Hehehe, I'm going to make me a nice stack of Mora off this...

### Additional Talk 3

Marjorie: This will make a handsome sum.
Marjorie: Wait till I've sold this and I'll be sure to compensate you fairly.
Marjorie: Look at that! Someone's taking an interest...

### Additional Talk 4

Jack: What's this?
Marjorie: Welcome! You have fine taste my friend, you've zeroed in on the most valuable item we have in the store.
Marjorie: This is a battle trophy seized from the hand of a hilichurl chief not long ago, by none other than this traveler here!
Marjorie: Who knows how long that frightful hilichurl hooligan has been menacing Mondstadt...
Marjorie: And don't think that just because this traveler is a seasoned warrior, it wasn't a fiercely fought battle!
Jack: Really, wow... Sounds like this hilichurl was a nasty piece of work...
Jack: ...Maybe I should get this and show it to Cyrus. Or Stanley.
Jack: Perhaps they'd see me differently then...
Marjorie: Oh, most certainly! We know how to keep a secret in this store, don't you worry...
Marjorie: My advice would be to take it now, or someone else is sure to snatch it up before long.
Jack: I need to think about it... Traveler â€” is it true what she says?

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: Every last word.
Jack: Well, I guess that decides it then. I'll take it!
Marjorie: Excellent choice sir, if I do say so myself! Here, I've wrapped it up for you. Have a wonderful day!

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: Actually it's just ordinary hilichurl garbage...
Jack: Really? What would I want to buy that for?
Jack: Whew... I almost handed over the cash too! In future, spare me the hard sell and just give me the facts!
Jack: I'm going to look elsewhere.

### Additional Talk 7

Marjorie: (Test) Really? You're going to take it?
Marjorie: (Test) We have a sale!

### Additional Talk 8

Jack: I appreciate what you did back there, traveler.
Jack: If it wasn't for you, I probably would have wasted a lot of money in that store.
Jack: Take these. You deserve them.

### Additional Talk 9

Marjorie: Why didn't you play along!? You have to do a bit of legwork to sell basic rubbish like this...
Marjorie: How often do I get a customer in here... You're unbelievable! You realize that if you screw this up for me, we both lose out, right!?
Marjorie: Ugh, forget it. Take these and get outta here, you're bad for business!

### Additional Talk 10

Marjorie: Good job backing me up just now!
Marjorie: Now, here's what I owe you... plus a bit extra for the sterling performance.
Marjorie: It's been a pleasure working with you. I look forward to doing this again!
