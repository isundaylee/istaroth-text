# Blooming Sands


## Talk 1

Raef: Agh, there's just no time at all...
Raef: And no one will swap shifts with me, either. What do I do now...
Raef: Eh? Traveler? Um... Traveler, please hold on a moment!
Traveler: What's going on?
Raef: I'm sorry for taking up your time, but I'd like to ask you if you're free... and if you could do me a favor...
Traveler: Well, let's hear your story, then...
Raef: You'd help me! Thank you! Thank you so much!
Raef: Here's the situation: I ordered a flower pot from Azalai's shop, alongside a batch of seeds.
Raef: Originally, I had asked a friend to help me get them...
Raef: But he suddenly told me that he had a mission to attend to and wouldn't have time to help me out. There was too little time for me to find someone else...
Raef: So Traveler, could you please help me collect my purchases from Azalai's? I hear that he should be at the entrance to the village right now, waiting for goods to come in.
Traveler: What did you buy all this stuff for, anyway?
Raef: They're for my girlfriend, Nermin.
Raef: She's in poor health, so she's been convalescing at home.
Raef: I mean, you've seen it too. Aaru Village is in the middle of the desert, so there's not much greenery to go around. Can't say this is the best environment, can you?
Raef: So I bought some plants to place in her house, but always staying in her room has kept her in a bad mood.
Raef: I'm also very busy at work, so I basically can't go to see her in the day. We only have time to talk to each other at night...
Raef: That's why I thought that perhaps I could get her to raise some flowers herself, if only just to help pass the time and take her mind off her illness.
Raef: I didn't expect things to get complicated like this...
Traveler: I'll go on your behalf.
Raef: Thank you so much! Just bring them straight back to me once you get them.
Raef: I need to sow those seeds, loosen the soil, apply some fertilizer...
Raef: But Nermin's constitution isn't that great. Will all this work just tire her out...?
Traveler: I'll get you your things.
Traveler: If you've got the pay, I've got the time.
Raef: Eh? Well... I do have some savings, so you don't have to worry about that...
Raef: But either way, thank you so much for agreeing to help.

## Talk 2

Azalai: Huh, so there was another batch after all...
Traveler: Hey, about Raef's goods...
Azalai: Oh, you mean the stuff he ordered from me? Well, you're in luck! The batch of goods I just received has his stuff in there.
Azalai: I must say, though, that he ordered quite a lot of things. Are you here to pick up his order?
Traveler: Are they very heavy?
Azalai: Well, apart from that pot, he's also ordered various seeds, fertilizer, and other items used in gardening...
Azalai: They're pretty weighty when put together. Are you sure you'll be fine by yourself?
Traveler: I've got my ways.
Azalai: Ah, is that so... Well, that's fine. I'll just get all this stuff wrapped up for you. Thanks for making the trip, by the way...
Traveler: I did agree to help, so...
Traveler: How much did he order...?

## Talk 3

Raef: Traveler! Have you brought the stuff?

## Talk 4

Raef: I do hope that Nermin can get better soon...

## Talk 5

Raef: These are the ones. Thank you so much, Traveler.
Traveler: Sure you're not trying to open your own flower shop?
Raef: Uh, well, I... I just wanted to buy more at once to save myself some extra trips, you know?
Raef: Anyway, go rest over there for a while. I need to sow these seeds and put some fertilizer in and...
Black Screen Text: Raef starts working on the flower pot...
Raef: Alright, this should do it! All Nermin needs to do is water this plant.
Raef: Traveler, could I, ah, trouble you to help me bring this flower pot to her?
Traveler: Why don't you go yourself?
Raef: I need to guard this path. If any foodstuffs or goods pass through, I'll need to get more people from the village to come take them.
Raef: And you know how it is around here. If we're too slow, the goods are going to spoil under the sun.
Raef: Just do me this favor, please. Nermin's not far from here. All you have to do is give this pot of flowers to her. I'll find a way to bring the rest to her.
Traveler: What do you need so much stuff for!?

## Talk 6

Black Screen Text: Someone inside hears movement...
Nermin: Hello. May I help you with anything?
Traveler: Well, I'm here to give you this flower pot.
Nermin: Huh... Is this from Raef?
Nermin: There are flowers in this pot? Really? Thank you for helping him send this to me. I like it very much...
Nermin: But... Can I really raise these flowers properly?
Traveler: Is it your first time growing flowers?
Nermin: Well, no. I'm just... not very good at taking care of plants. The previous ones all withered in my hands...
Nermin: I imagine that this pot of flowers must be even more delicate still. If I were to fail to care for it properly again...
Nermin: Ugh, no, no, I can't just... Since the flowers are already in my hands, I must take good care of it!
Nermin: Perhaps Granny Kulsoom knows how to solve this problem...

## Talk 7

Raef: You're back, Traveler. Thank you so much for helping out... How is Nermin doing?
Traveler: She's worried that she won't be able to take care of the flowers.
Raef: Well... I'll help her look into this. If all else fails, we'll find someone to ask about it.
Raef: And if even that fails... I'll just... look for something that's easy to grow and keep alive, I guess.
Raef: Well, in any case, thanks for helping me out, Traveler. Please, take this as your reward.
Raef: I'll send the other items to her later.
Raef: Wait a moment. Did these gardening tools not come with instruction manuals? ...Oh no. I have no idea how to use them!
Traveler: Have you never sent her flowers before?
Raef: Well, I wouldn't say that exactly, but the ones I would ask people to help me buy for her were already fully-grown. By the time they arrived in the village, they were nearly all dried out...
Raef: That's why I decided that I would send her a freshly planted pot of flowers this time.
