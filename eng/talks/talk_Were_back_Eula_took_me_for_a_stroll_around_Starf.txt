Beidou: We're back! Eula took me for a stroll around Starfell Lake. The scenery is amazing, especially from up in the hills.
Eula: I'm glad you liked it. I was worried I might have bored you with all the aimless wandering...
Beidou: Not at all! You're talking to someone who spends most of her days at sea. The opportunity to take a nice stroll through the woods is actually pretty special.
Beidou: #So, how's that potion coming, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: We still need a little more time!
Beidou: No worries. I've got plenty of time before I have to head back.
Traveler: It's almost there!
