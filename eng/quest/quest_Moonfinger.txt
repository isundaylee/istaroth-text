## Talk 1

Shitou: Welcome to the Jade Mystery, my good friends! Would you like to try your luck betting on jade? This could be your lucky day.
Shitou: It's cheap and it's fun, and who knows, you just might strike it rich!
Paimon: Betting? No, no, we're here for... um, what was it again?
Zhongli: Noctilucous Jade, of radiant grade at the very least.
Shitou: Radiant grade Noctilucous Jade? I see, you're not a tourist. My apologies. I have some here for your perusal...
Shitou: (Fade to black. Shitou fetches goods.)
Shitou: What do you think? The Jade Mystery is an old name in the jade business. Just look at that wonderful quality! Rex Lapis doesn't often bless us with such finery. Go on, pick whichever one you like!
Paimon: These three pieces really do look pretty, not like the ones you usually dig up...
Paimon: But how do we pick? Should we just grab one and go?
Traveler: A man who makes his living off betting on stones can't be trusted so lightly.
Zhongli: Very good. It seems you have learned some tricks of the trade.
Paimon: What do you think, Mr. Zhongli? How should we pick from these pieces of Noctilucous Jade?
Zhongli: Oh? You want me to decide? That is fine as well.
Zhongli: If it were me, the answer would be simple.
Paimon: Oh? And that would be...?
Zhongli: I'll take them all, boss.
Shitou: Oh, you act with such panache, good sir! I always knew you were not a man of ordinary caliber!
Paimon: Wait! Wait! Boss, that one didn't count! We need to discuss it again!
Paimon: (Fade to black while Zhongli, protagonist, and Paimon step to one side to talk amongst themselves)
Paimon: Hey! If we only need one for the ritual, aren't we wasting three times the Mora if we buy them all!?
Traveler: That's true.
Zhongli: Oh, Mora. Hmm...
Zhongli: It is as you say. I suppose I overlooked this particular aspect of the transaction.
Paimon: Huh? How do you not think about Mora when buying things!?
Zhongli: If one must always consider Mora before acting, then in all things one is bound by Mora.
Paimon: Ahh... What?
Zhongli: All Mora is currency, but not all currency is Mora.
Paimon: ???
Traveler: He's talking about economics.
Paimon: Is this how the rich live?
Paimon: Well, he knows a lot about big money, but not a lot about big savings.
Zhongli: No need to waver. Even when I am constrained by Mora, I have ways of working around my limitations.
Zhongli: Evaluating the quality of Noctilucous Jade is indeed very tricky. As crude ore, there is little difference in texture, lustrousness, and internal pattern between good and bad Jade.
Zhongli: Only after the item made using Noctilucous Jade has taken shape, will you be able to see whether it is up to par or not.
Zhongli: If you return to those crafty merchants to quibble, they will counter by saying that your crafting bench is to blame, or that your heat control was poor.
Paimon: Whoa! To think it's that easy to get cheated...
Zhongli: But there is a way to truly evaluate this jade, and a true insider would know it.
Zhongli: "A fool sees the pointer and misses the moon."
Paimon: What does that mean?
Zhongli: If you point at the moon with your finger, a wise man knows that you are pointing at the moon, while a fool will only see the finger.
Zhongli: The patterns, the facade, these are all the "finger." Noctilucous Jade is a mystical stone used to light up the darkness, and so its brightness is the important thing — it is the "moon."
Zhongli: Noctilucous Jade of excellent quality would have superior Pyro affinity. In other words, the bluer and brighter the luster of the ore under high temperature, the higher its quality.
Traveler: I didn't realize you were such an expert...
Zhongli: I have imparted the priceless secrets of the jade trade to you. Now all that's left is to put it into practice.
Paimon: Priceless, huh... Paimon's just sad that we might never be able to use it again...
Paimon: (Fade to black while Zhongli, protagonist and Paimon return to Shitou's store)
Paimon: We're back to buy some rocks, boss. But can you let us burn them first?
Shitou: B—Burn them? You can't do that, my friends! If you were to do so, what would I have to sell?
Traveler: Then, can we get some small samples?
Shitou: That... Well, fine. As you wish, then.
Shitou: How about this? I can take a small sample of all three. I'll take a bit of a loss — we'll count it as a friendly gesture.
Zhongli: Don't worry, I know the rules. As long as we can prove that it is good jade, you will not take a loss.
Zhongli: (Fade to black. Shitou obtains samples.)
Shitou: Alright. Take these as samples. I've carved them off with a knife and tagged them to boot.
Traveler: These samples...
Paimon: ...Aren't these too thin?
Paimon: Even paper's thicker. No, even a bug's wings are thicker! These are almost see-through!
Traveler: How stingy...
Shitou: Stingy? I've already been very generous. Any more, and you may as well have my neck!
Paimon: But wouldn't something this thin go poof if we held it to the fire?
Zhongli: It can't be helped. Trying to deprive a merchant of his profits would be like forcing a ravenous wolf to vomit up the food in its stomach. Nonetheless, under the right conditions, these thin slices will serve.
Paimon: What sort of conditions?
Zhongli: While we add the high temperatures using Pyro, we can use Hydro to reinforce it from within. This way, the samples will not disintegrate immediately.
Shitou: Oh? Oh, sir, to think you were this learned... Thank you for your understanding!
Zhongli: Strictly speaking, asking for samples when we have not yet agreed to purchase the goods is unfair. Trade in Liyue must be based upon fairness.
Paimon: Well, guess we just need to find a place to try this out...
Traveler: I remember this spot in the Dadaupa Gorge...
Paimon: Ooh! Paimon remembers! We once saw this <color=#00E1FFFF>biiiiig pot</color> down at the <color=#00E1FFFF>Dadaupa Gorge</color>, in the camp of the hilichurls from the Meaty Tribe! It's real sturdy, and should be able to take the elemental reactions!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, now, let's pack those samples up and make a move!
Traveler: How about the kitchen at Xiangling's place...
Paimon: You mean at Wanmin Restaurant? As long as we do it when she's not in...
Zhongli: That would not do. It is a place where people come and go. They would be endangered if the elemental reaction were to get out of control... We cannot take such a risk.
Traveler: This is impressive handiwork.
Shitou: Hahaha. You flatter me, but I have to be gentle with these rocks. They are my pride and joy!
Shitou: If I'd taken off even a bit more, it would have killed me.
Traveler: So thin...
Traveler: Then I'm not buying any.
Shitou: Not buying...? Ah, come, come now, my good friends... we can still discuss this. Negotiation is key to trade, wouldn't you say?
Traveler: Is this normal life for a high-class gentleman?
Traveler: Sounds like he's loaded.
Paimon: So loaded that he doesn't even bother hunting for a bargain.
Traveler: Actually, it's two times more Mora.
Traveler: What do you think, Mr. Zhongli?

## Talk 2

Paimon: There's still soup in here. These hilichurls sure have big appetites!
Traveler: Well, it's our lab now.
Paimon: This soup looks like it could be used as our Hydro elemental protection. Let's fire it up and begin our experiment!
Paimon: (Animation: Carefully place or throw samples into cooking pot)
Paimon: We're ready to go! Paimon will help remember which one of the three is which!
Paimon: Use <color=#00E1FFFF>Pyro</color> to keep making the pot hotter, until we get the results we need.
Paimon: Mr. Zhongli said that the <color=#00E1FFFF>shinier and bluer</color> the ore gets, the better it is, so pay close attention!
Traveler: Shame to let it go to waste...

## Talk 3

Zhongli: We can leave the jade here. I have already called for a jewelsmith to shape them into the implements that we will need.
Zhongli: Ah, yes. I have yet to go and see Childe. So as for the jewelsmith's remuneration...
Traveler: We'll pay the jewelsmith when he arrives.
Paimon: Guess we can't do anything else. Also, is this where we're doing the Rite of Parting?
Zhongli: Yes. I have already rented this location, and have begun making preparations for the rite.
Traveler: The Rite of Descension took place here, too.
Zhongli: That's right. The Liyue Qixing have acquiesced to using the same location.
Paimon: But when something this big happened here... should suspects like us really be at the crime scene? We might get caught by the Millelith.
Paimon: Although with that said, since we got back from Jueyun Karst, none of those pesky Millelith soldiers have come chasing after us. Wonder what that's about...
Paimon: Also, the, uh, Rex Lapis' vessel...
Zhongli: Traditionally, we call it the Exuvia.
Paimon: Ah, right. That's what it was called! You seem to know everything, Mr. Zhongli. Um, so, was this Exuvia hidden away by the Qixing? I mean, we haven't even figured out who the murderer is...
Zhongli: One must think that they already have someone in mind. Or perhaps they already know. Surely they must have found all the evidence that there is to find here.
Traveler: It still feels very odd.
Zhongli: These things are for the authorities in Yujing Terrace to consider. Trying to help would probably only add to their troubles.
Zhongli: Before the Rite is conducted, the Exuvia will be kept temporarily in the Golden House.
Paimon: Golden House?
Zhongli: The only mint in Liyue... which is to say the only mint in Teyvat. All the Mora that flows throughout the world is minted there.
Paimon: Wow—
Paimon: No, Paimon wasn't thinking about anything bad. Paimon thinks it suits Morax.
Paimon: But why do you know this, Mr. Zhongli?
Zhongli: Since the Rite of Parting has the approval of the Qixing, it is a semi-official event. As such, there is already some limited information available.
Traveler: The Qixing provide the location, and Childe the funds...
Zhongli: Perhaps each has their motives... but this is the capital of commerce. A little exploitation once in a while is not unacceptable.
Zhongli: In Liyue, where the God of Contracts reigns, only contracts may not be betrayed. I for one have no issue with little maneuvers outside their remit.
Zhongli: Well then, we should go and prepare the <color=#00E1FFFF>perfumes</color> used in the Rite.
Paimon: Perfumes? Where'll we get those? Do we buy them?
Zhongli: No, perfumes used to honor the gods must be freshly decocted. The quality of the <color=#00E1FFFF>Silk Flowers</color> we require is also special.
Zhongli: Silk Flower petals contain a fibrous material of good quality, often used in brocade-making. Its scent, however, is most elegant, and is especially suited for solemn events like giving offerings to gods and adepti.
Paimon: It's time for Zhongli's lectures on high society again...
Zhongli: We shall not speak of the details right now. Follow me, we shall go to the merchants to purchase our ingredients.
Traveler: They must have some ulterior motive...
Traveler: Seems a bit too easy-going...
Traveler: So we're just using the scene of the crime to...
Zhongli: The Liyue Qixing have agreed to this arrangement.
Traveler: Fingers crossed Childe will reimburse us...
