# Talk Dialog

Shuyu: I didn't know that you two were so good at beetle battles!
Traveler: That's right, I've always been a master beetle battler.
Paimon: Even so, it was usually Bull-Chucker dragging us into it...
Shuyu: This really is an interesting form of recreation! If I do get the chance to play it in Inazuma, I'd like to try the original form.
Paimon: Sounds good! We've got lots of friends in Inazuma, too, so when you get there, we can get everyone together. We'll have a blast!
Traveler: We didn't expect you to be a mechanical expert either...
Paimon: Yeah, and you're even teaching others now. You must've learned all kinds of skills by now, huh?
Shuyu: I wouldn't say so... Really, I've just been learning the fundamentals from Master...
Shuyu: She doesn't live in seclusion anymore these days, nor does she intend to have me live that way.
Shuyu: That's why she's taught me two sets of mechanical arts â€” one adeptal, and the other mortal.
Shuyu: She said that I could make a good living for myself using normal mechanical arts, should I want to live in Liyue Harbor in the future.
Shuyu: And that won't get in the way of my continued study of adeptal mechanical arts, either.
Paimon: That makes a lot of sense. Wow, she really does think of everything, huh...
Traveler: Would you like to find a job, Shuyu?
Shuyu: I... I don't know yet. Right now, I'd prefer to stay by Master's side.
Shuyu: But if she needs Mora, I'll help her make some!
Paimon: Paimon doesn't think she'd ever need Mora. Even her smallest inventions could sell for crazy amounts in Liyue Harbor...
Traveler: She's probably even wealthier than a certain "consultant" we know.
Paimon: C'mon, he's an exception. There's no point in talking common sense with him.
Traveler: Want to make the big Mora, Shuyu?
Traveler: Let's have a good beetle battle next time!
Shuyu: Ah, I guess you've got other things to do, right? In that case, I'll see you around!
