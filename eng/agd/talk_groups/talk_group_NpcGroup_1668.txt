Amber: Hahaha, it's been ages since I've built a snowman — it's so fun! Still a little cold, though... Brrr... My fingers are numb...
Eula: Amber, if the cold is getting to you, there's always hot soup back at the camp. Take a rest if you need one. Don't put too much pressure on yourself.
Joel: So Amber really feels the cold, huh... but Aunty Eula, it doesn't seem to affect you at all.
Eula: Maybe it's because of our different capabilities. Elemental energy is... Ahem, sorry, not something you need to know about in any great detail. Simply put, it's because we have different abilities.
Amber: Yeah, harnessing the cold is definitely her specialty. In fact — in summertime, just standing next to her cools me down!
Joel: Huh... c—capability? I didn't really get it, but... never mind. I like snowmen too.
Joel: I, uh... really wish my dad could see them...

Traveler: How have things been going recently?
Joel: Things are going great! Dad still doesn't remember a ton of stuff, but I'm just happy to have his company!
Joel: I've found some toys that we used to play with together. Maybe he'll remember a couple more things once he sees them!
Joel: I mean, I'd be okay even if he doesn't remember everything. We'll find new toys to play with, and we'll make new memories together!
Joel: Like... Uh...

Traveler: Like snowmen?
Joel: Yeah, like snowmen! I love 'em! And hide-and-seek, and building blocks, and reading stories...
Joel: The snow around here is super thick and white. We've already agreed to go make a snowman shaped like a fox later!

Traveler: Take care of yourself now.
Joel: Yup, sure will!
Joel: Oh well, an adventurer gave this to me previously... He said that it's a watch that brings you luck.
Joel: I mean, I found Dad again, so I guess it must be a lucky watch after all!
Joel: I'll give it to you now. I sure hope it brings you as much luck as it did me!

## Talk 4

Traveler: See you around, then.
Joel: Yup, see you!

## Talk 5

Traveler: He'll be fine.
Joel: Thanks... Well, you look like a Traveler. Will be you be going up the mountain to go on more adventures?
Joel: If you are, then please take this pocket watch with you.
Joel: An adventurer gave this to me. He said that it's a watch that brings you luck.
Joel: I wanted to give it to Daddy, but I could never find the chance...
Joel: If you're going up the mountain, you should take it. Hope it'll bring you good luck. Have a safe trip!

Joel: Who's th— No, Daddy said that I should be more polite...
Joel: ...How do you do?

Joel: Where has Daddy gone...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Joel: Ah, I... Hello... I—I can't find my daddy...
Joel: He said that he would come to pick me up and that we'd go see the snow together. But the time we arranged has come and gone, and he isn't here yet...
Joel: I thought that he must have found some rare and precious treasure map or something, which is why he hasn't come to find me yet. That has to be it, right?
Joel: So I came to Dragonspine by myself. If he's not going to come find me, then I'll go looking for him... Or so I thought...
Joel: But I didn't find Daddy here, either. That Knight of Favonius over there said that he'd headed off for the mountain's summit...
Joel: I wanted to go search for him, but the Knight wouldn't let me. So I'm stuck here waiting for Daddy to come back.
Joel: But... but he hasn't come back at all, and I'm worried.
Joel: If you're going up Dragonspine, could you help me look for Daddy?
Traveler: Leave it to me, kiddo.
Joel: You'll do it? Great!
Joel: Let me think... That Knight said that Daddy did mention going to follow the *Snow-Covered Path upwards* first...
Joel: He then said that he'd head over to the *Outskirts of the Entombed City* to have a look, before trying for the *mountain's summit*...
Joel: Please help me to search these areas. Daddy might still be near one of them.
Joel: I mean, he promised that we'd go see the snow together. There's no way that he'd break his promise...
Traveler: Where should I look?

### Talk 7 related talk 1

Joel: How did it go? Any news from Daddy?
Traveler: Here's what we discovered in the cavern at the summit...
Joel: Daddy... No, that can't be. Daddy's a great adventurer! He'd get out of a small rough patch like this for sure.
Joel: He said that he'd found a way down the mountain in his notes, didn't he? He must've made it down safely. That's gotta be it.
Traveler: I suppose he made it down safely...
Joel: Exactly. He must've! He might even be resting right now.
Joel: Or... he might have set up a new campsite at the summit, and is taking a break there right now...
Joel: Whatever the case, I'm sure that once he's all rested up, Daddy will come here and look for me...
Joel: I'll keep waiting for him here. Thanks for helping me out, by the way. Here, these are for you.
Traveler: I didn't find anything.
Joel: R—Really? But that Knight of Favonius said that Daddy did go up the mountain.
Joel: Maybe he was mistaken... Or maybe Daddy set up a new campsite elsewhere...
Joel: Well, guess I'll just wait here for him... I bet Daddy would be worried sick if he came home and couldn't find me.
Joel: Thanks for helping me out. Here, take these.
Joel: Where are you, Daddy...
