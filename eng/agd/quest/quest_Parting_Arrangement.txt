# Parting Arrangement


## Talk 1

Balfour: Ah, my wondrous heroes! Would you be game for a few more rounds of Fungus Mechanicus?
Balfour: And should you have any questions, feel free to ask away!
Traveler: Play Fungus Mechanicus
Traveler: So, about future funding...
Paimon: That's right! If you hadn't mentioned it, Paimon would've totally forgotten! During the first tournament, we were attracted by the big...
Paimon: *cough* Err, we were attracted by the big tournament, which also had a sweet prize!
Paimon: So that means that we'll also have to prepare a tidy sum for the next tournament, won't we? That way, we can motivate people to aim for the top, which is where the best prizes will be!
Paimon: We'll also have to rent the venue, hire staff... And all this stuff's gonna cost Mora... Are we really gonna have to fork over all eight figures of it?
Balfour: Haha, and now you're speaking my language!
Balfour: Not to worry. I will be on the hunt for sponsors in the lead-up to the next tournament. We're talking about something along the lines of several dozen merchants helping to put up the funds for it to be held.
Balfour: As for remuneration, we'll just have to provide them with the equivalent amount of "exposure." After all, many merchants place great emphasis on the advertisement potential that popular competitive events have!
Traveler: I understand.
Paimon: That does sound pretty reasonable. If things go well, raising funds this way means that everyone wins!
Balfour: This field of work can be considered my specialty. Just give the okay, and I'll start sponsor-hunting.
Balfour: Of course, I'll investigate the status of all our sponsors very carefully before organizing it into a chart for your perusal.
Traveler: We will indeed have to be quite selective.
Balfour: Understood. Vigilance will be the watchword â€” especially after what happened the last time!
Paimon: We'll be counting on you then, Balfour!
Traveler: We'll definitely have to weed out any people with ill intent.
Traveler: That's definitely an idea.
Traveler: We can leave it for later.
Balfour: Alright! See you later, then, great heroes!

## Talk 2

Paimon: The timing's just right, and we've spent quite a bit of time testing Fungus Mechanicus, haven't we?
Paimon: Guess we can go look for Haniyyah and Balfour right about now to give them some feedback, huh?
