# Glaze Domain, Multum in Parvo


## Talk 1

Paimon: Wow, it's a big ball of water...
Klee: I wonder what it feels like? Can I touch it?
Paimon: It's so big that we could probably pass straight through it!
Traveler: And that was the last we ever heard from Paimon...
Paimon: Wah, that's so scary! Stop giving Paimon the heebie-jeebies!
Eula: Let's not touch it for now. We still don't know enough about our environment.
Paimon: But we can't just do nothing at all, because then... nothing at all will happen.
Kaeya: Hmm... I have a feeling that this could be the core that sustains this entire bottle-domain.
Kaeya: In which case the moment we touch it, this place will instantly revert to its original size... with all of us still inside.
Collei: Yikes...
Paimon: Okay, okay, Paimon won't touch it, geez!
Klee: Kaeya... Are we really gonna get squished inside a bottle?
Kaeya: Of course not, Klee. I'm sure the real core of this domain is hidden away in a very safe place.
Kaeya: Somewhere like... over there, for example.
Collei: (Ah! I was so nervous that I didn't notice that big wheel at all!)
Eula: Wait! Who goes there!
Water Droplet: Gurgle!
Paimon: It's... It's the waterball monster! Ah, the waterball monster is real!
Water Droplet: Gurgle...
Collei: It doesn't seem hostile... In fact, don't you think it looks happy to see us?
Paimon: R—Really? Uh, you're sure it's not gonna gobble up Paimon whole?
Water Droplet: Gurgle...
Klee: I don't think it's hungry! Are you, Water Droplet?
Water Droplet: Gurgle...
Kaeya: Oh dear. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm not understanding a word of this.
Klee: Wait, don't go! Wait for us!
Water Droplet: Gurgle...
Collei: Why'd it stop?
Collei: Maybe it can understand us after all?
Klee: Oh, I get it now! It's leading the way for us — just like the cats in Mondstadt!
Collei: Like the cats...? How so?
Kaeya: When you're walking around in Mondstadt city, sometimes a cat will show up on the side of the road.
Kaeya: It'll walk ahead of you for a while, and if you're curious enough to follow it, you'll soon find yourself in front of a fine establishment called:
Traveler: The Cat's Tail!
Kaeya: Exactly. So let's see where this Water Droplet takes us. It could be interesting.
Traveler: Watch out, you might get gobbled up by the water-ball monster...

## Talk 2

Water Droplet: Gurgle.
Paimon: Huh, another strange contraption... And there's a weird-looking wall over there.
Collei: This kinda looks like that ball of water we saw earlier...
Collei: Did the Water Droplet bring us here because it wants our help with something?
Water Droplet: Gurgle...
Klee: What? Your friend is trapped in the wall!?
Water Droplet: Gurgle...
Klee: Don't be sad, Water Droplet! We're here now, we'll save your friend!
Paimon: You bet! But, how're we gonna save them? Do we have to break down this wall somehow?
Water Droplet: Gurgle!
Klee: Nope, we can't do that! No breaking the wall.
Kaeya: Hmm... Do we need to find a key of some sort, then?
Water Droplet: Gurgle!
Collei: Oh no! Where'd it go?
Eula: Look, the device has lit up. And it's projecting images onto the wall.
Kaeya: A two-dimensional space... with objects of the same composition as the device nested inside...
Klee: Yep! What Kaeya said! And that's where its friend is.
Eula: But how exactly do we enter the image on the wall?
Klee: Maybe... we just copy what the Water Droplet did?
Paimon: Umm... But what does that mean?
Kaeya: Hold on, I think Klee's onto something.
Kaeya: Since the Water Droplet appears to be the key that activated the mechanism, we may be able to follow it inside simply by touching the device.
Kaeya: The principle is no different than how we entered this bottle domain.
Paimon: Fair enough... Okay, deep breath, then head in!

## Talk 3

Idyia: Okay, this is the spot.
Idyia: Now, I'm sure you're both wondering: "But where's the component?"
Idyia: "There's nothing here! Oh, where could it be..."
Paimon: Oh, it's that lamp thingy, right? Water Droplet showed us how that works already.
Idyia: Uh... yes, that's the one... There goes my big introduction.
Idyia: Showing people the ropes is supposed to be my job... I can't believe I'm being shown up by a Hydro Eidolon...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Cheer up, Idyia. The Hydro Eidolon can give a basic demonstration of how to use things, but beyond that, it can't communicate...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: That's where you come in. Your descriptions can explain everything in full, vivid detail.
Paimon: Paimon forgot how persuasive Kokomi can be when she really wants to... Sometimes having a genius strategist around really comes in handy.
Traveler: (Now I see how an eloquent speaker can persuade others to not only agree with them, but do things for them...)
Idyia: Oh, if you put it that way... Well then, just pretend like you've never seen it before, and I'll tell you all about it!
Idyia: This is called the Streaming Projector. Everything here in the Veluriyam Mirage was made using this device...
Idyia: All you need to do is place an item in the Projector, and you can construct a corresponding item based on the shape of the original and your imagination.
Idyia: ...At least, I think that's what it used to do. With the domain in its current state, only its most basic functions are still operable.
Traveler: Basic functions... like shining light?
Idyia: Okay, not quite that basic... At the moment, it's only able to show two-dimensional objects. I call them "preprints."
Idyia: Think of it like a sort of draft or blueprint, or something.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: So you're saying, the component fell into the preprints?
Idyia: Yes, exactly. I'll leave you to go in and physically retrieve it, while I... Uh, I'll be out here rooting for you by... by doing a motivational dance!
Paimon: Really?
Idyia: ...No. Sorry. I feel like I have two left feet when I try to dance. I guess I'll just... find a place nearby to sit and wait patiently for you...
Paimon: Hey, come on, cheer up. We'll handle everything from here!

## Talk 4

Paimon: It was flat as a pancake in there, but as soon as it came out, it turned all plump and round...
Paimon: Hehe, guess it makes sense that the Water Droplet's friend is also a Water Droplet.
Collei: Aw, and they both do the same thing to show they're happy.
Paimon: Ah, Water Droplet number two ran off...
Water Droplet: Gurgle!
Klee: #It's saying thank you, {M#Mr.}{F#Miss} Honorary Knight, that was a huuuuge help.
Traveler: It was nothing!
Eula: #{NICKNAME}, how do you feel after entering that two-dimensional space? Any... physical side effects?
Traveler: No, I feel the same as ever...
Paimon: You sure seem fine to Paimon.
Eula: Well, I'm just glad that you're okay.
Paimon: Good thing Eula's here to look out for everyone... Can't say the same for you though, Kaeya. You were pretty quick to send the Traveler inside...
Kaeya: #Hey now, I only suggested that because I was confident that {NICKNAME} would be fine.
Klee: Water Droplet, is there anyone else here besides you and your friend?
Water Droplet: Gurgle?
Klee: Yep, y'know, anyone who looks like me or my friends.
Water Droplet: Gurgle!
Paimon: Oh, it ran off again... Hopefully this is a good sign.
Collei: Amazing... C'mon, let's follow it!
Traveler: Ah, the pain! I've been squished flat like a Traveler pizza!
Paimon: Hmph, quit while you're behind. You're clearly fine.

## Talk 5

Sangonomiya Kokomi: Idyia, the situation is now critical. Our window of opportunity to fix this is rapidly closing.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I'm sure you've noticed just how much things have deteriorated in recent days.
Idyia: B—But, even so...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: This is your home. Are you really going to let everything fall to pieces?
Idyia: I... Well, I live here, but it doesn't actually belong to me...
Paimon: Huh? Paimon knows that voice...
Traveler: Definitely sounds like someone we know.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Anyone else who comes into this domain in the future will take one look at the ruins before them and conclude that this place was abandoned years ago.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: But just imagine how different things could be if you maintained this domain in perfect condition. Whoever sets foot inside would witness a magical wonderland...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: How miraculous it would feel to them to find such unimaginable beauty in the middle of a lifeless desert.
Idyia: *sigh* You're right, General, truly, but—
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Act now, while you still can. You have to stand up to this, and break free from your despair.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The most important thing is to have no regrets in the end.
Idyia: Huh... Heh, well... No one CHOOSES to have regrets, do they...
Idyia: But I take your point... I'll try my best to stop running away.
Idyia: But the question remains of where to begin...
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon's figured out who it is.
Klee: #Is it {M#Mr.}{F#Miss} Honorary Knight's friend from a faraway land?
Traveler: She's a Divine Priestess...
Klee: A divine priestess? What's that? Is it a kind of mage?
Water Droplet: Gurgle...
Idyia: What are you doing here? Huh...? We have new visitors?
Idyia: Greetings, everyone. This is the Veluriyam Mirage, and I'm the caretaker, Idyia...
Idyia: I'm so sorry that you have to see this domain in its current state of disarray. We are actively working on repairs, and everything will be back to normal shortly! Um, I hope...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Greetings, everyone. I guess I should introduce myself, too—
Idyia: It's all right, just leave the introductions to me.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: (Hmm? I kinda wanted to say hello in my own way... But no harm done, I guess I'll let her do the honors.)
Idyia: This lady is a visitor to the domain, just like yourselves. She is a formidable military general.
Idyia: Have any of you heard of Inazuma's "Onmyou Chamber"?
Collei: The... what chamber?
Idyia: Onmyou chamber. It's an elite training academy for gifted students of Onmyoudou. Practitioners are divided into four classes, A through D, and assigned the power of shikigami based on their mastery of the art...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ah... Wait...
Idyia: This lady famously led the class D underdogs to victory against the class A favorites in the final mock-campaign before graduation, an astonishing feat that few in the history of the academy have ever achieved. Hence, "formidable general" is no exaggeration!
Idyia: Isn't that right, General? Uh... What's wrong?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: ...
Paimon: Huh? Wait, so the favorites were beaten by the... classy underdogs...? Paimon's not completely following...
Traveler: ...
Traveler: (Those all sound like tropes from some Inazuman light novels!)
Klee: #That doesn't sound like the "Divine Priestess" {M#Mr.}{F#Miss} Honorary Knight was talking about.
Collei: (Uh-oh, did she just get caught lying in front of someone she was trying to impress? Or... maybe she uses a different identity in her private life, and this is the first time her friends are learning about it...)
Collei: (Seems... kind of embarrassing, but also kinda cool... I guess having someone else to introduce you is a good way to make an impression...)
Collei: (Hmm, maybe I'd fit in better with everyone if I had a title, too?)
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ahem... Some people call me a general, but it's just their way of showing respect. My actual name is Sangonomiya Kokomi.
Idyia: Huh? Oh no... Sorry, my mistake, General... Uh, I mean... Miss Sangonomiya?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Call me whatever you like, Idyia. The only important thing about names is knowing who's who.
Klee: Oh, I get it now! It's like that story that Mom told me that time!
Water Droplet: Gurgle?
Klee: Klee can explain! So basically, in the story, a big group of people go on an adventure to Bottleland. One of them's called the "king," and some of them are called "knights"!
Klee: So Miss Sangonomiya must be the super smart one who solves all the problems in the story... Um... What's that one called again?
Eula: Perhaps a "sage"?
Kaeya: Indeed, wisdom is an important attribute found in military generals.
Klee: Okay, well I'll just call you that! Hehe, Miss General it is!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Fine by me. It sounds really cute, coming from you.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: (At least... cuter than my pen name, that's for sure...)
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Well then, how should I address the rest of you?
Traveler: Old friend for me... I hope!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hehe, how could I ever forget you? But what about these esteemed ladies and gentlemen accompanying you? I'd be delighted if you could introduce me to them, too.
Klee: Wait, Klee wants a title, too! Hmm... okay, got it. Klee wants to be a Mage! The kind that flies around everywhere. Da-da-da! WHOOSH!
Klee: #Kaeya can be the "Master Thief," {M#Mr.}{F#Miss} Honorary Knight can be, uh... the "Knight." And Paimon will be the "Fairy" who follows the Knight everywhere.
Kaeya: Master Thief, huh? I did like playing pirates as a child, so I suppose this is an apt role for me. And I must admit, the "Master" part is a nice touch.
Eula: Hold on a second! Are you saying the position of "Knight" is now filled?
Klee: Eula can be the "Swordmaster," who can cut through anything and also gets to wear a super sparkly cape!
Eula: Hmph. That's more like it.
Klee: And Collei can be, umm... the "Healer."
Collei: ...
Traveler: ...If you wanna be the Knight, we can swap.
Collei: No no, I don't mind, Healer is a great role! I just don't know if I'm qualified to be one...
Collei: Whenever I'm thinking of titles for myself, I usually imagine myself as an "adventurer" or "musician." I never thought I could be a Healer... I mean, it feels like it should be Master Tighnari's role, if anyone's...
Klee: Don't worry, Collei, you'll be the bestest healer ever! You don't talk much, but you're very kind. Just like the Healers in Mom's stories!
Eula: You'll do fine. I heard you're good with bandages. You can patch up a wound, can't you?
Collei: Uhh... I can pitch a tent? Maybe you heard wrong... But I'll do my best! It's my first day filling in for Master Tighnari, but hopefully it's the first of many!
Idyia: This is a great idea... Once a new visitor arrives, they can assume a new identity... then add in some role-playing...
Klee: Oh, we can't leave you out, Miss Idyia! Hmm... There are lots of characters in Mom's stories, but you don't remind me of any of them...
Idyia: That's perfectly okay! I already have a role here anyway, remember? I'm the caretaker.
Klee: I got it, I got it! This wasn't in any of the stories, but you can be the "Mascot!"
Idyia: Mascot...?
Kaeya: Klee, maybe you could think up an even better role for Miss Idyia?
Idyia: A mascot, you say... Isn't that a character that doesn't have to actually do anything, and sits around letting everyone else do all the important work? Incredible, you've seen right through me...
Collei: Sounds like the idea of being lazy is pretty exciting to her...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The Mascot serves to maintain troop morale, Idyia. Don't underestimate your role.
Idyia: Ah, alright. I'll be the Mascot, then.
Water Droplet: Gurgle?
Idyia: That's right. Thank you for bringing these new friends here safely. You can go off and play now.
Klee: Thanks, Water Droplet! See ya!
Idyia: Hmm, Water Droplet? Is that your pet name for it? Haha, I suppose it's as accurate a nickname as any.
Kaeya: We keep getting sidetracked... but I believe you were saying something about being in a difficult predicament. Is something wrong with the Veluriyam Mirage?
Idyia: Ah yes, about that... I'm afraid the entire domain has recently sustained some significant damage...
Idyia: It was as if... the whole world was suddenly flipped upside down. A few components went missing from the core, which sustains the domain, and the impact cascaded out from there.
Idyia: Needless to say, many things in the Veluriyam Mirage have now stopped working...
Idyia: Just days after I agreed to let my friend's daughter come and visit, too. When she gets here, and sees the state this place is in—
Klee: Oh, so you're Mom's friend? Hi, Aunty Desert, I'm Klee! Here, I brought the Magic Invite — see?
Idyia: Huh? Wait, so you're... you're...!
Eula: Look how dilated her pupils are... She must be very surprised.
Collei: Yeah, and not in a good way...
Klee: Mom's the one who sent me here! She's the strongest mage ever. She said that her friend lives in the desert — you live in the desert, so that must be you! Right, Aunty Desert?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ah, I see. So being a mage runs in the family.
Idyia: Aaaah!!!
Idyia: You're... you're Alice's daughter!? Oh, I just want the ground to swallow me up right now... Wait, that's it! I'll hide myself away in the core of the domain! Hide there until this all blows over. See you all in a hundred years!
Collei: Idyia's really going through it! She's like a shriveled little forest fungus, hanging its head in shame!
Eula: ...Collei? That's a harsh analogy, where'd all that come from?
Klee: Don't worry, Aunty Desert, Klee's here to help you! And all my friends will help, too! Just take a deep breath, then another deep breath, and all your worries will fly away!
Traveler: Klee's right. Many hands make light work...
Paimon: #Yeah, don't you worry — {M#Sir}{F#Lady} Fixalot over here has a good track record with this kind of thing!
Idyia: Well, I'm useless... but it looks like that won't matter with all you capable people around. Fantastic!
Paimon: Don't put yourself down, Idyia, you're great too!
Idyia: Thanks for your encouragement... Anyway, for the time being, please talk amongst yourselves.
Idyia: That'll give me some time to think things through, and maybe make a start on... um, delegating...
Traveler: As a Knight, it shall be my honor to render my assistance...
Traveler: Comrade-in-arms... unless you've forgotten!

## Talk 6

Paimon: Hey Idyia, you got an update for us? We've all caught up with each other.
Idyia: Very well. Then please allow me, Idyia, your Mascot, to explain exactly what's happened here...
Traveler: (She's pretty happy with this Mascot role, huh...)
Idyia: Basically, this entire domain is powered by a device called the Central Hub, which you all saw earlier.
Idyia: But following a major incident, several key components from the Central Hub came loose and went flying.
Idyia: ...Four components, I believe, which has caused the Central Hub to stop turning.
Klee: Ohhh, so that thing's supposed to spin?
Idyia: Yes! It definitely shouldn't be frozen still like it is now! ...At least, that's not how it was when I first got here? Ugh, I've done such a terrible job of taking care of it, it's so embarrassing...
Paimon: Hey, everything's gonna be okay. So, we need to fix the big wheel up there, and to do that we need to find the missing parts.
Idyia: Right... I do know where one of the parts is. It landed not too far away.
Idyia: But the rest all landed in different areas. I'm afraid you'll have to go and look for those...
Idyia: Ahem! Now, as the caretaker and your mascot, I shall announce your respective adventure duties!
Collei: Umm... You can just be yourself if you want, no need to force the whole roleplaying thing...
Idyia: ...Oh, I see... Um, okay, so I was thinking that maybe Swordmaster Eula and Healer Collei could investigate the northern zone, if that's okay?
Eula: Fine by me. I was going to be looking for my cousin there anyway.
Collei: I'll be your backup, Eula. I know you usually team up with Amber, so I'll try my best to fill her shoes.
Eula: Oh? Well this'll be fun. Let's see if a forest ranger can outperform an outrider.
Idyia: Master Thief Kaeya and Mage Klee, if you could earmark some time in your busy schedules to search the west zone...
Klee: Earmark? What does that mean?
Kaeya: It just means we mustn't forget to do it. Don't worry, we can handle that.
Idyia: #Finally, we have our General, Miss Sangonomiya, and our Knight, {NICKNAME}. If there's no objections, please come with me to retrieve the first component.
Traveler: Understood.
Idyia: Alright. Well, if anyone finds anything, come back here and we'll regroup.
Idyia: Please take care while you're out on the road, and look after each other... especially our little mage here.
Klee: You got it! I'll take extra-special care of Kaeya.
Kaeya: I'll be on my best behavior.
Idyia: ...
Idyia: Okay, we'll leave it there for now. You two, please follow me.
Traveler: You have my sword!
Idyia: Wow... Spoken like a true knight.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hehe... Then for my part, my strategic mind is at your service.

## Talk 7

Idyia: All you need to do is touch the Streaming Projector and you'll enter the world of preprints...
Idyia: Don't worry. It's not dangerous.

## Talk 8

Paimon: What is this thing, anyway? Some kind of gear?
Paimon: And why's it so small? It doesn't look like it belongs in that huge wheel...
Idyia: It's hard to explain, but I assure you that it's definitely one of the components.
Idyia: So that leaves three more components missing...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Every journey begins with a first step. I think we're off to a good start, and things should keep going smoothly from here.
Idyia: Y—You really think so?
Traveler: Of course, trust the General!
Idyia: I suppose you're right... she did manage to defeat class A at the Onmyou chamber, after all...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Um... You, uh, don't need to keep bringing that up!
Idyia: Anyway, thank you for all your help.
Idyia: I'll take this and start trying to repair the Central Hub. You two may as well head back to town.
Idyia: *sigh* Why am I so clumsy? Once again, I was no help at all... The least I can do is try and handle the actual repairs.

## Talk 9

Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hmm...
Paimon: What's wrong, Kokomi?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I'm just a little confused... You mentioned that the Water Droplet showed you how to use the projector?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Can you tell me a little bit more about that? I'm so curious to know what happened.
Paimon: Oh, sure!
Black Screen Text: You tell Kokomi everything that happened earlier with Water Droplet.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I see...
Paimon: Hey, look! The wheel is spinning now.
Paimon: Aww, and now it's stopped again. Well, that didn't last long...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It also wasn't spinning at the right speed. Before the incident, it spun much faster than that.
Paimon: Oh, so you saw it back when it was still working?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Yes. I arrived here a little earlier than the rest of you. But the incident took place not long after I entered.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Like Idyia said, it felt like the world was "flipped upside down"... I don't know how else to describe it... and I certainly don't want to experience it again.
Idyia: *sigh* It's no use... Seems it won't run until all the missing components are returned.
Idyia: For a moment there, when it started turning, I got excited... I thought that maybe the hub can work just fine without the other three...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Wishful thinking is only going to lead to disappointment, Idyia. Let's stick to the plan, we'll get there.
Klee: #Hey, {M#Mr.}{F#Miss} Honorary Knight and Miss General are here! Oh, and our mascot!
Klee: You beat us! I was sure we were gonna be the first ones back!
Kaeya: Hey. How'd it go?
Traveler: Mission complete!
Kaeya: Haha. Impressive. I doubt you'd find many other knights of such caliber even among the Knights of Favonius.
Idyia: How about our Master Thief and Mage? Did you find anything?
Klee: You bet! We made a huuuge discovery!
Klee: The place we were trying to get to was blocked off. We couldn't see anything past it, and there was no way around.
Klee: But then, just now, a huge canyon appeared outta nowhere... so we hurried back here!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It appeared just now?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: ...
Klee: #Come and see, {M#Mr.}{F#Miss} Honorary Knight! Let's go on a canyon adventure!
Traveler: To the canyon!
Idyia: I'll sit this one out. I'm beat after trying to make those repairs... I need to take a break.
Klee: Miss General, you should come, too! You can hide behind me and give me smart advice while I protect you!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Wonderful. It would be an honor to serve as adviser for our young mage.
Klee: Hee-hee, let's go!!!
Traveler: Where a knight's sword goes, victory soon follows!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Idyia: Hmm? Who else has visited the Veluriyam Mirage recently? There was someone from the Akademiya who came not long ago... a Kshahrewar scholar. Blond hair, architect, I think?
Idyia: He was a huge help, and redesigned many of the buildings here. Although he was always grumbling to himself, he was extremely diligent in his work. Ah... What a kind person...
Idyia: I could tell that was a sensitive soul, a lot like me... Ah! Sorry, please pretend you didn't hear that... Ahem! I'm of course a very strong and resilient person.
Idyia: After him, an aristocrat from Mondstadt showed up, then the Gen— I mean, Miss Sangonomiya.
Idyia: Unfortunately, everything here suddenly started changing before I'd had the chance to be a good host and show them around.
Eula: Do you know where the Mondstadt aristocrat is now?
Idyia: ...If I remember correctly, he headed north after the incident.
Idyia: It's a pity we're having all these issues... *sigh* If we could get everything working normally again, I could probably locate him in an instant.
Idyia: Still, not to worry. There's nothing dangerous here.
Eula: Mm...

### Additional Talk 2

Klee: #Hi Miss General! {M#Mr.}{F#Miss} Honorary Knight says that you're from Watatsumi Island...
Klee: What's it like there? There must be loooads of fish, right?
Klee: Wait! You look kinda like a mermaid. Are there fish in your family?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Oh, uh... Sorry to disappoint you, Miss Mage, but I'm just an ordinary human.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I have lots of great stories about Watatsumi Island, though. C'mon, let's enjoy the scenery while I tell you all about it.

### Additional Talk 3

Kaeya: Feeling nervous, Collei? It's your first time as a guide, after all.
Collei: Hmm? Oh no, not at all. I'm just... still settling into the role, so I was thinking about how to talk more like Master Tighnari...
Kaeya: Well, the easiest way to imitate someone is to start with their most common turns of phrase.
Collei: Oh, okay. In that case... Ahem! "Put that mushroom down! Now! It's highly poisonous."
Kaeya: There you go. With just a few simple words, you've captured your master's personality perfectly.
Collei: Anyway, what about your role? Don't you mind being the "Master Thief"? It doesn't sound like you're one of the good guys...
Kaeya: Maybe not — until you factor in that I only steal from the enemy. I think that's enough to make me one of the good guys... don't you?
Collei: Oh, uh... fair point, fair point...
