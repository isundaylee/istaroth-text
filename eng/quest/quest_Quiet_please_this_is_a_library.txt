# "Quiet, please, this is a library!"


## Talk 1

Ella Musk: Ye ika gusha mosi!
Traveler: You seem upset.
Ella Musk: My apologies... That's because the library's been so loud recently that I can't study Hilichurlian in peace.
Ella Musk: Ever since the Windblume Festival started, there's been a great number of people hanging out here. Initially, they were keeping quiet and reading books, but then they started... chatting.
Ella Musk: There's more... They did a lot of terrifying things...
Ella Musk: Turning book corners... Sticking strange objects between the pages... They even went as far as to put books back on the shelves upside down!
Ella Musk: A library is not a place for romantic rendezvous! Unless one aims to disrupt all scholars actually studying inside as intended, that is!
Traveler: Wyratt should be maintaining order in here.
Ella Musk: What can he do? Throwing people out won't solve the root cause of the problem.
Ella Musk: That's why I need to ask for your assistance. Please tell them to get a hold of themselves.
Traveler: I've got this covered.
Ella Musk: Thank you. Those three couples over there are making the most noise. If you can make them aware of how bothersome their babbling is, I'll be able to continue my research.
Ella Musk: But be careful. They're quite difficult to handle...
Traveler: I'll see what I can do.
Traveler: You can bring it up with Lisa...
Ella Musk: But I've heard that she's currently out on patrol with the Acting Grand Master. If she were here, those couples would surely be on their best behavior...
Traveler: You sound fiercer than usual.

## Talk 2

Young Man in Love: Such a thrilling story! It's a shame they didn't get to have their happy ending.
Young Woman in Love: We definitely won't become like them, right?
Young Man in Love: That goes without saying. Even if we were torn apart and placed in different corners of the world, I'd find a way to bring you back to me.
Traveler: You should keep quiet in the library.
Young Woman in Love: Huh? I've been keeping my voice low all this time.
Young Man in Love: *sigh* It's like in that book — an obstacle in the way of our love...
Paimon: You should also put the books you've finished reading back where they belong.
Paimon: Look at all those books lying around in complete disarray. Somebody will have to put them back on the right shelves, and they're not gonna be happy about this mess.
Young Man in Love: Yeah, yeah, we got it. Could you leave us alone? You've interrupted us at a crucial moment.
Paimon: Crucial moment...?
Young Woman in Love: No matter what hardships befall us, do you promise to stay the same as you are now and never change?
Young Man in Love: I do. I swear on my life.
Young Woman in Love: That seems a bit excessive... The very thought of losing you tears my heart in two.
Young Man in Love: Ah, your gentle nature makes me fall for you even more...
Paimon: It's like talking to a brick wall.
Traveler: Someone complained that you're too loud.

## Talk 3

Besotted Woman: Excuse me? Did you want something?
Traveler: You should keep quiet in the library.
Besotted Woman: My apologies, I'll be more mindful of that. I just can't help giving voice to my feelings sometimes.
Man Doing Magic Tricks: While you weren't paying attention, I drew out a rose from between the pages.
Man Doing Magic Tricks: This book-born rose is just like you — delicate and full of scholarly beauty...
Besotted Woman: Wha—!? That was amazing!
Paimon: You're being too noisy! And books aren't meant to be used as props for magic tricks! You'll tear them apart!
Traveler: You might want to keep it down too, Paimon...
Paimon: Oh, sorry. Paimon didn't mean to...
Besotted Woman: So now you understand. Some things are beyond our control.
Besotted Woman: Once again, I'm truly sorry. I'll keep my volume in check.
Paimon: It doesn't seem like they took it to heart...
Traveler: Someone complained that you're too loud.

## Talk 4

Seemingly Rational Woman: You claim that "fluctuations of emotions may influence the accuracy of research and analysis"? This assertion is founded on insufficient grounds.
Seemingly Rational Man: *sigh* I understand. I must be encountering some strange hindrance to my research...
Seemingly Rational Man: You've come at the right moment. I'm having a little trouble right now, and I'd like to have your opinion on it as an outlander.
Seemingly Rational Man: If I want to prove the veracity of my logic, I must ensure that I keep my cool.
Seemingly Rational Man: But I can never do this, and especially not when I'm debating with her — I just can't seem to keep my cool and think.
Seemingly Rational Woman: I find it strange, too. Did you not sleep well last night? Or are you hungover?
Traveler: Either way, you probably shouldn't speak too loudly in the library.
Traveler: Either way, you should both pipe down a bit.
Seemingly Rational Man: Sorry, but I won't rest until I figure this out.
Paimon: H—He didn't listen at all...
Paimon: Well, you shouldn't be disturbing others either way. Also, stop putting the books back on the shelves with spines facing inward!
Paimon: Ugh... They're not paying us any mind at all...

## Talk 5

Paimon: *sigh* Guess nobody's in the mood for advice, huh?
Paimon: None of them have very good library etiquette. Best we go talk it over with Wyratt.

## Talk 6

Traveler: So, about the racket in the library...
Wyratt: I see... I guess we'll just have to use "that method."
Wyratt: Miss Lisa mentioned in the past that there will be consequences for breaking the library rules...
Wyratt: Do you mind going into the library to pass Miss Lisa's message along?
Paimon: Making dog-ears on pages, stuffing roses into books, putting them onto shelves the wrong way... These are definitely violations of the library rules.
Paimon: Well, let's go pass Lisa's message on to those people in the library who aren't reading the way they should.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Eh!? What? Lisa's coming back soon?
Paimon: Oh no! She'll be real mad when she finds out that people have made a mess out of the books and even dog-eared the pages, won't she?
Traveler: That's right — oh no, how terrible! Who will save us?
Paimon: Oh, what are we to do? Oh, oh! Maybe there might still be time if we start cleaning up now!
Ella Musk: That was quite ingenious of you. Quite unexpected.
Traveler: That was Wyratt's idea.
Traveler: Well, Lisa's reputation precedes her.
Ella Musk: Still, Miss Lisa probably would have been mad if she had seen the state the library was in earlier. This is a library, after all — a place of learning.
Ella Musk: Guess I can finally continue my research in peace. Here, take this as thanks.
