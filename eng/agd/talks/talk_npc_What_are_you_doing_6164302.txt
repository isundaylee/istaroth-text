Traveler: What are you doing?
Alfred: Heh. Just singing my daughter's favorite nursery rhymes.
Alfred: She used to beg me to sing them to her each day the moment I got home... But I was so focused on my work, Iâ€”I just ignored her...
Alfred: And then, I went to Liyue to give a performance... she suddenly fell ill and... she didn't make it. I didn't even get to see her before she died.
Alfred: All she wanted was for her daddy to sing to her... Such a simple thing. Such a small thing. And I failed to give her even that...
Alfred: Oh my darling, don't worry, Daddy's here for you... Daddy will always be here for you...
