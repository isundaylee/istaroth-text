# The Mysterious Wangsheng Parlor


## Talk 1

Paimon: Was it... something Paimon said?
Paimon: Let's go after him, he might do something stupid.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, "the ones who no longer speak"... Did she mean talking to the dead?
Paimon: Uh... She's a weird one.

## Talk 3

Hu Tao: Hmph, rejecting a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It's their loss.
Hu Tao: Some things are inevitable. It's only a matter of time.

## Talk 4

Hu Tao: *sigh* Seems like the old ways are the most reliable after all.
Hu Tao: Meng, are you done preparing our promotional materials?
Meng: Ah... My apologies, I'm only about halfway through. Do you really think they'll be effective?
Hu Tao: Trust me, they're going to work wonders. This marketing strategy has been used by Wangsheng Funeral Parlor for generations.
Hu Tao: Clients in need come to our door and write down their commissions on blank wooden tiles. Then, they squeeze those inside the parlor through the crack under the door.
Hu Tao: I fulfill the request written on each tile to make sure our clients are satisfied with the service, no matter if it's an obituary, cremation, or funeral that they seek.
Hu Tao: Although... it is a bit of a hassle with the constant back and forth. If only we could burn 'em by the batch...
Meng: No, director, I'm not asking about the wooden tiles themselves but about the "special offer" they advertise.
Traveler: Special offer?
Hu Tao: Hehe, Wangsheng Funeral Parlor should keep up with the times! Just think about it! If we don't attract new clients, we'll be left with nothing, won't we?
Hu Tao: Business development is a crucial element of every prosperous enterprise. I've been trying various marketing strategies ever since I became the director.
Hu Tao: I put up posters, just like all the other shops, but the Millelith promptly removed them.
Hu Tao: Then, I organized the "Wangsheng Visitor's Day," but no one showed up.
Paimon: Well that doesn't come as a huge surprise...
Hu Tao: And finally, I discovered that the traditional ways are the most reliable after all. I took inspiration from the wisdom of previous directors.
Hu Tao: So now, I go from door to door, looking for people and organizations willing to cooperate. Just like during our visit to the Adventurers' Guild! That's what I mean by "business development."
Hu Tao: The other method I'm trying is using the wooden tiles as coupons. Just by writing things like "Buy one, get one free for the holder of this tile" on them.
Paimon: Wh—What do they buy and what do they get?
Hu Tao: Hehe, a solid and durable "second home," of course.
Hu Tao: They may not need it right away, but they can be sure that when they do, it will still be as good as new. "It won't start deteriorating before you finish doing so yourself" — that's the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor quality guarantee.
Traveler: ...I don't know what to say to that.
Hu Tao: Alright Meng, keep adding those special offers to the wooden tiles! The future of our business depends on it.
Meng: I'm still not sure this will work...
Hu Tao: Oh, I get it! You think that our special offer is not comprehensive enough, right?
Hu Tao: It is true, I was offering all kinds of great benefits to the Adventurers' Guild because they are a new client.
Hu Tao: But in doing so, I neglected my old clients. You're right, it's unfair.
Hu Tao: Hmm, let me do some market research! Wait here, my faithful assistants, I'll be back with you in a moment. It shouldn't take too long.
Paimon: Paimon already told you, we're not your assistants!
Paimon: *sigh* Guess we got dragged into somebody else's business AGAIN. Let's look around while she's away.
Traveler: No wonder you're on the Millelith's radar.
Traveler: Didn't you say the wooden tiles should be blank?

## Talk 5

Lan: I have a reputation for being a weirdo amongst the ranks of the Adventurers' Guild...
Lan: But it's only because they haven't had an opportunity to talk to Hu Tao.

## Talk 6

Hu Tao: Hmm... The way we're wording this lacks... warmth and sincerity.
Hu Tao: If we're content to settle for just seeing people off, how can we give them a sense of really having "gained" something?
Meng: But... that's a tough feeling to convey in this industry...
Hu Tao: Precisely the problem! If we can't get that feeling across, then how will we get return clients?
Meng: R—Return clients?

## Talk 7

Examine Board: (A board used for hanging Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's wooden tiles. According to Hu Tao, all the tiles should be blank...)
Examine Board: (...In which case, the characters on the back of the tiles must be the "special offer.")

## Talk 8

Examine Door: (So, behind this door is Wangsheng Funeral Parlor...)
Examine Door: (It looks far more ordinary than the director made it out to be.)

## Talk 9

Paimon: Where are we going?
Hu Tao: To visit an important potential client. I'll lead the way.

## Talk 10

Hu Tao: Ugh, why do they get angry? What's wrong with a few earnest health tips?
Paimon: Paimon thinks it's because they're coming from the director of a funeral parlor...

## Talk 11

Hu Tao: Ugh... another failure. Still, not the end of the world.
Paimon: Paimon's curious, does this approach ever work out for you?

## Talk 12

Congzi: I know your face... The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor Director, right? Sorry, I'm really in no need of—
Hu Tao: Don't apologize, get to know us! We've got a new sale going on.
Hu Tao: Ever hear the saying "out with the old, in with the new"? Well, going out with a bang is the best way to start off in style on the other side! Hee-hee.
Congzi: If you keep talking like this, I'll have to call the Millelith.
Hu Tao: No no no — okay, relax, we're leaving.
Hu Tao: But Wangsheng Funeral Parlor awaits your distinguished patronage.
Paimon: You really don't give up, do you?
Traveler: Tough crowd.
Hu Tao: Hmm? Are you trying to make me feel better?
Hu Tao: ...Thank you. Seems you understand me far better than most people.
Paimon: Not really, this is just getting really uncomfortable...
Traveler: Enough "business development." Please, help me find someone.
Hu Tao: "Business development"? Is that what you see this as?
Hu Tao: Surely you don't think all that was "business development"!?
Paimon: Then what was it exactly!? Traumatization for its own sake!?
Hu Tao: No no no, the "business development" ended after the discussion with the Adventurers' Guild!
Hu Tao: I was helping to find somebody for Meng. You remember Big G?
Traveler: Rings a bell.
Hu Tao: As it turns out, the "Big G" that Meng is looking for is a ghost adrift in the mortal realm.
Hu Tao: The three we saw just now were all people I suspected of being followed by Big G. But having seen them, I didn't sense the presence of anything otherworldly.
Hu Tao: So we just had a quick chat, and I left it at that.
Traveler: If that was "stopping for a quick chat"...
Paimon: Why didn't you say so? Paimon thought you had some kinda sixth sense for, uh... People in declining health...
Hu Tao: Huh? What would I need that kind of ability for? I'm no doctor.
Hu Tao: Haha! Were you seriously hoping that the Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor was going to start healing people? Or...
Paimon: Paimon was trying to subtly imply that... Uh... never mind, Paimon wouldn't know how to explain subtlety in a way you'd understand...
Hu Tao: Uh... Well, let's leave that for now and head back to Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. This Big G matter is very closely linked to Meng.
Traveler: I wonder what "business development" looks like...
Traveler: I don't recall...
Traveler: There's no persuading them.
