Traveler: What if I want to take a boat to the Court of Fontaine...
Rena: Ah, you speak of the aquabuses that travel along Fontaine's waterways, eh?
Rena: This is the starting point of the Clementine Line, which heads from Romaritime Harbor to the Court of Fontaine.
Rena: If you want to take one of those boats to the Court, just take a seat on that long bench, and one will arrive shortly.
Rena: The Melusine tour guide on board will introduce you to... some assorted trivia, so stay tuned.
