Traveler: Hello... there?
Baishi: Aah! Traveler!? Wh—Where did you come from!?
Baishi: Can't you see that I'm busy picturing... Um, pi—picking out clothes for Lady Ningguang?

Traveler: You were drooling.
Baishi: I... I have no idea what you're talking about! I am simply devoted to Lady Ningguang's... image. That's all!
Baishi: Someone like her, who has all the cares of the world on her shoulders, should never have to waste an iota of her great mind on something as mundane as picking her own clothes.
Baishi: In any case, as her secretary, it's my paramount duty to concern myself with her outward appearance!
Baishi: ...It's just that, whenever I start thinking of Lady Ningguang's elegant form as she stands before the masses, or her silhouette as she changes her clothes... or her perfect body, glistening like polished jade as she emerges from her bath...
Baishi: Ah, or perhaps we could go with her festive garments. Simple yet luxurious, emitting a faint fragrance as their blue folds billow...
Baishi: I just... I just... Oh my.

## Talk

Traveler: I practically worship Lady Ningguang.
Baishi: You worship her? In what way? Intellectually? Spiritually? Or...
Baishi: Hmph! Well, whichever it is, keep it to yourself, and don't get any ideas above your station!
Baishi: Lady Ningguang is a very busy person. She has no time for your fanaticism.
Baishi: Let me teach you a thing or two about "diligence," and then you ought to go and reflect on your actions!

Baishi: That gorgeous phoenix sash, woven from gold thread... Then, that figure-hugging silk dress... And last but not least, the lace lingerie... Oh my...

Traveler: ...Are you alright?
Baishi: Aah! Wh—Where did you come from!? ...Hmph, it's very rude to sneak up on people like that!
Baishi: Can't you see that I'm busy picturing... Um, pi—picking out clothes for Lady Ningguang?

Traveler: ...Carry on as you were...
Baishi: Hehe... Where was I... Ah yes, let's not forget the perfume...
