# Silent Seeker of Knowledge


## Talk 1

Paimon: Wow, this place is huge!
Paimon: Paimon knew there's something off about that cave! Let's think of a way to get over there and have a closer look. Who knows, maybe we'll find a lead of some kind!

## Talk 2

Paimon: There you are.
Paimon: Haypasia! Are you alright?
Haypasia: Uh, ughhh... So hungry... *cough* Need... water...
Traveler: She looks famished!
Paimon: There's no way we can get her to eat in her current condition. Let's try finding some water first.
Paimon: Huh? Wait! Why does it look super foggy outside all of a sudden? Anyway, let's go look around!
Traveler: She somehow has more energy than I expected.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Huh? Wh—Why can't we beat this guy...? Paimon doesn't get it. We've faced others like him before — what's wrong this time?
Abyss Herald: Traveler, though you may have managed to avert countless crises before, your good fortune was bound to end sooner or later. It's time you realize how weak and powerless you really are!
Traveler: My journey will not end here!
Abyss Herald: #Your {M#sister}{F#brother}? Mwahahaha! Oh, pitiful Traveler, are you really so ignorant? Or are you just living in complete denial?
Abyss Herald: #{M#Her Highness}{F#His Highness} has long since forsaken you. Your meager existence in {M#her}{F#his} eyes is that of an annoying bug only to be stepped upon!
Abyss Herald: The bonds of love and family which drive you to find your sibling are utterly gone! Your journey is meaningless!
Abyss Herald: But don't you fret now. Today will be your last. Now die!
Traveler: #I still must find my {M#sister}{F#brother}!

## Talk 4

Traveler: Ugh! Huh...
Traveler: (What was all that just now? Strange... It feels like I was just dreaming for a moment there, but I can't remember what I saw...)
Paimon: Hmm, what do we do? We haven't seen Haypasia anywhere out here...
Paimon: Oh, there she is! Quick, let's see how she's doing.
Haypasia: So sweet... Mmm...
Paimon: Well, the good news is that she's still conscious. Hey! Why'd you drop her food on the floor like that!?
Traveler: Sorry, I uh... kinda zoned out for a second there.
Paimon: Uh, are you okay? That's really not like you...
Paimon: Anyways, we can talk about this later. We'd better make sure she's alright first.
Paimon: Whoa, wait a sec! Look at all this fruit lying around her. We can put that to good use!
Black Screen Text: After giving the semi-conscious Haypasia some water and fruit juice...
Haypasia: Ugh... Who's there!? Tighnari, is that you? Ah!
Haypasia: Huh?
Paimon: It's okay, you can relax, Haypasia. Tighnari sent us here to bring you some food and water. Here, we have a letter that he asked us to give you.
Black Screen Text: You give Haypasia the letter from Tighnari.
Haypasia: I see, so you're friends of Tighnari. I apologize for all the trouble I've caused you.
Haypasia: I'm grateful that you came so quickly to save me. You even brought all this fruit.
Paimon: Uh well, actually, we didn't bring the fruit. It was already here when we arrived.
Paimon: We were kinda wondering about that, actually. When we found you here, there was all this fruit lying around and even some juice dripping from your lips... Uh, how did you end up like this anyway?
Haypasia: Oh? Really?
Haypasia: Hmm, I seem to understand now. All the fruit was likely from my, uh... neighbor. Must have come by and saw me like this.
Paimon: Your neighbor? You mean there's someone else living nearby?
Traveler: Is it a little round creature?
Haypasia: Oh? So you're able to see them, too?
Black Screen Text: You tell Haypasia and Paimon everything that happened after entering the cave.
Traveler: Kind of like... a cabbage?
Traveler: Sorry, seeing Haypasia must have given me a shock.
Paimon: Oh, guess that makes sense... She does look kinda rough at the moment.

## Talk 5

Paimon: So you came across an Aranara here, and they caused you to have a dream.
Haypasia: Ah, so that's what they're called... An Aranara. So... not only can you see those creatures, but you're quite familiar with them, too.
Traveler: Yes, we've bumped into them before.
Paimon: Just out of curiosity, Haypasia, how is it that you see the Aranara, but don't know anything about them? You didn't even know what they were called.
Haypasia: Ah, well you see, they've never actually spoken with me directly, and I've never asked anyone about them... Though, I did begin to sense that these Aranara, as you call them, have some sort of deeper connection with the Dendro Archon.
Paimon: Really? How could you sense that?

## Talk 6

Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it, you must have startled them.
Haypasia: Hehe, yes, apparently I did. I admit that I still feel guilty about that...
Haypasia: Given that you're familiar with the Aranara, you probably already know that they don't have ill intentions when forcing you into dreams. They only do so to give themselves a chance to run away.
Traveler: Yes, that's what thought, too.
Paimon: You know, Haypasia, the fact that the nearby Aranara not only often appear around you but also came to your rescue shows that they've taken a real liking to you.
Paimon: Paimon bets it won't be long before your neighbor starts talking to you and becomes your close friend.
Haypasia: Thank you, I hope that day comes soon. Ah, before I forget, Tighnari mentioned in his letter that you have questions for me regarding Irminsul...?
Traveler: It's because the Aranara are very timid creatures.

## Talk 7

Haypasia: I feel like they aren't as afraid of me as the first time I approached them, but I never would have expected them to save me.
Traveler: What fascinating creatures.
Haypasia: Yes, no doubt about that. By the way, Tighnari mentioned in his letter that you had questions for me regarding Irminsul...
Traveler: Sounds like a great neighbor.

## Talk 8

Haypasia: *rumbling*
Haypasia: Ehehe... Sorry about that. Sounds like just drinking juice still isn't quite enough for my stomach.
Paimon: Well, if somebody hadn't dropped the food earlier...! Ugh, anyway, looks like we'll need to prepare something ourselves. Besides, Paimon's getting hungry too! Let's eat first and talk about Irminsul later.
Paimon: Alright, we're up, Traveler! Today's menu will feature Sweet Madame and a Radish Veggie Soup! You'll love them, Haypasia. They're our specialties, after all!
Haypasia: *drooling* Sounds good! Oh, I've never tried any dishes from other nations before. I certainly look forward to it! It's been so long since I've had a decent meal, too. To be honest, the last time had to be when Tighnari came to visit.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Wait, hold on a second, Traveler! You say that before we arrived, you saw some mysterious creature and suddenly had a strange dream? Isn't that a little too crazy to believe?
Haypasia: No, I actually do believe what the Traveler is saying. I myself had a similar experience once before and ended up scaring my timid, little neighbor here.
Haypasia: You needn't worry — he means you no harm. He only dragged you into the dream because he hoped to buy himself a little time in order to scurry away.
Paimon: So Haypasia, just what kind of creature is your neighbor exactly?
Haypasia: I'm not sure what it's called, to be honest... But I do know that they have some sort of deeper connection with the Dendro Archon.

## Talk 10

Haypasia: I know this because the first time I saw them was also the exact day my consciousness was able to form a connection with Irminsul.
Haypasia: Even after I opened my eyes and stopped meditating, my heart was still pounding and my mind was racing with all the knowledge that I had touched.
Haypasia: And at that very moment, I suddenly noticed a small figure at the opening of the cave.
Haypasia: In my curiosity, I began to walk over to the creature. They must have already been used to me living in the cave, because they didn't seem to mind me approaching them. They just kept doing whatever they were up to.
Haypasia: It wasn't until I crouched down next to them that they suddenly realized that I could see them.
Paimon: Oh, and then?
Haypasia: And then, I had a dream... By the time I came to, they were nowhere to be seen.
Haypasia: I was convinced they'd never show up again, but sure enough, I saw them nearby a few days later... and they weren't alone.

## Talk 11

Black Screen Text: You cook up some dishes over the fire.
Paimon: All done! Let's use the empty box that Tighnari gave us since we already washed it.
Paimon: Ohhh, it smells amazing! And the box is a nice touch, too. Let's go serve this up and start eating with Haypasia!

## Talk 12

Haypasia: Are you already finished cooking? Mmmm, smells delectable! I'm truly thankful whenever I can enjoy a proper meal like this. Cooking really isn't my forte...

## Talk 13

Black Screen Text: After a delicious meal together, you tell Haypasia about connecting with Irminsul...
Haypasia: Even though everything you mentioned was in Tighnari's letter, it's still hard to believe you were able to connect with Irminsul... immediately after smelling Spirit Borneol for the first time.
Haypasia: It took me nearly three years before I could do so... And everyone at the Akademiya even lauded me as a genius.
Haypasia: You should know that some researchers spend their entire lives without ever successfully connecting with Irminsul as you have.
Paimon: So why does this incense allow people to connect to Irminsul?
Haypasia: The ingredients used to make Spirit Borneol primarily consist of plants created by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. These special ingredients are conducive to heightening our senses to the Dendro Archon's power.
Haypasia: Since the root of the Dendro Archon's power lies within Irminsul, we can occasionally tap into her powers to peer into the depths of the earth.
Traveler: I think I understand.
Haypasia: Naturally. Anyone who can establish a connection with Irminsul on their first ever attempt must be a person of great understanding.
Paimon: #Hmm, makes sense... But Paimon's got a question! Why was {M#he}{F#she} sensitive to the smell of those plants for such a long time?
Haypasia: #That was primarily due to {M#his}{F#her} body's unique constitution. Stimulated by the incense, {M#he}{F#she} could perceive the Dendro Archon's power and experienced a sensory overload, hence the adverse reactions.
Haypasia: Taking in any scent similar to the ingredients of Spirit Borneol would cause adverse effects.
Haypasia: Not to worry, though. It appears you have already fully recovered.
Haypasia: Technically, your body should still be sensitive to the powers of the Dendro Archon, but unless you are using intentional meditation techniques, the scent of Spirit Borneol should no longer trigger such reactions.
Paimon: Whew, well that's a relief.
Haypasia: I must admit, I am quite envious of your abilities. Even if it meant suffering from pounding headaches for the rest of my life, I'd consider it worthwhile so long as I could connect with Irminsul at will.
Paimon: Whoa, you're really serious about this whole thing, aren't you?
Haypasia: Haha, I am a researcher, after all.
Haypasia: As a member of the Rtawahist Darshan at the Akademiya, my main area of research is the stars and their connection to the fate of living beings. But there is still so much we don't know, especially regarding the mysteries that lie in the starry skies.
Haypasia: Which is why I must turn to the all-knowing Irminsul for answers.
Haypasia: If only my perception wasn't so limited... Unfortunately, I cannot guarantee that my every attempt to attune with Irminsul will be successful, or that doing so will leave my consciousness intact.
Haypasia: I am currently in the stage of training known as "Satyavada Life." Many researchers in Sumeru have lost their minds while seeking to attune with Irminsul during this stage.
Haypasia: Sages have said that Irminsul contains divine knowledge, and touching such knowledge without the proper preparations and abilities will only lead to one's mind caving in on itself.
Haypasia: That's why we meditate alone. We need to ensure that our minds will be calm while minimizing the possibility of involving anyone else.
Paimon: Whoa, so knowledge from Irminsul can be super dangerous! Don't you ever feel afraid of the risk, Haypasia?
Haypasia: Of course I do, especially during nights that are pitch black with no moonlight, and dead silent without even the sound of insects.
Haypasia: However, I've been feeling better as of late. I don't get as scared anymore knowing that I have a little neighbor living nearby.
Haypasia: I believe that being able to see them is a sort of blessing from the Dendro Archon.
Haypasia: Heh, but what's strangest of all is that they're clearly an envoy of the God of Wisdom herself, and they have the curious power to make people dream.
Paimon: What's so strange about that? It doesn't sound so out of place for a divine being, does it?
Haypasia: Well, it's strange because nearly nobody in Sumeru can ever dream.
Paimon: Huh? Is that true?
Haypasia: Yes... Well, to an extent. Only children can dream in Sumeru. Adults, however, never do.
Haypasia: The sages say that wisdom implies rationality, but that which occurs in dreams is often neither rational nor logical.
Traveler: Reminds me of the dream I saw from the Aranara...
Haypasia: Yes, if one struggles with anxieties, those emotions could influence their dreams.
Haypasia: The fact that the people of Sumeru do not have dreams is seen as a blessing by the sages. They believe that Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, the God of Wisdom, is keeping us away from the foolish delusions you encounter in your sleep.
Haypasia: I was born into a family of scholars in Sumeru City. Ever since I was a child, my parents would always tell me that I'll know I've grown up once I stop dreaming.
Haypasia: I studied hard, enrolled as a student in the Akademiya, and went on to become a researcher. *sigh* Sure enough, I never dreamed again.
Haypasia: But then, on the day I scared the little Aranara... I suddenly saw a dream again.
Haypasia: It was incredible. Though I don't exactly remember what I saw, I clearly recall the feeling... I suddenly felt like I was a child again.
Haypasia: Back then, I was foolish and ignorant as any youth would be, but I was free of fear... Maybe dreaming isn't as bad as we've made it out to be.
Haypasia: Ahem... Just be sure not to speak of this if you travel to Sumeru City. They'll look at you as if you've lost your mind.
Paimon: #So do you have any thoughts about the things {M#he}{F#she} saw when {M#he}{F#she} connected with Irminsul?
Haypasia: Sorry, I'm afraid I don't have any answers as of now. All I can say is that what you saw is a memory contained within Irminsul itself.
Haypasia: Hmm... "world... forget me..." What could that possibly mean?
Haypasia: Agh, if only I could ascend past Satyavada Life and begin Paripurna Life, I might have some more answers for you.
Haypasia: *sigh* If you two are ever in the area again, please be sure to come and see me.
Traveler: Thanks, Haypasia!
Haypasia: There's no need to be thanking me, you two are my saviors! Besides, I'm already looking forward to tasting some more of your cooking, hehe.
Black Screen Text: You continue chatting before settling down for a good night's rest.
Paimon: Now that we know Haypasia is alright and had the chance to ask her some questions, Paimon thinks it's about time to head back to Gandharva Ville.
Traveler: We wish you luck in your endeavors.
Traveler: It was a big, chaotic mess...
Traveler: Sorry, you lost me there...
Haypasia: That's alright, I'm sure you'll come to a clearer understanding as you remain in Sumeru.

## Talk 14

Ghulam: Think about it, Tighnari, refusing to join is tantamount to burying your head in the sand!
Ghulam: I understand that you're a Forest Watcher and that it's your duty to combat the effects of Withering Zones, but isn't it evident that such work is not a lasting solution to the problem?
Ghulam: As Sage Khajeh clearly stated, your presence and guidance in Sumeru City is pivotal in finding a cure for Irminsul. How could you possibly refuse!?
Khajeh: Keep your emotions in check, Ghulam. Let's at least listen to Tighnari's reason for declining. We're here to invite him to the Akademiya, not to cause a scene.
Tighnari: Sage Khajeh, I am truly honored that you came here in person, but I'm afraid I must still decline your invitation.
Tighnari: I am merely a Forest Watcher. How could the great minds of the Haravatat have any need of someone like me?
Khajeh: Haha, well it turns out that your refusal letter had some implications on your master's reputation. He is a renowned Sage of the Amurta, after all. So now, I've come here in his stead.
Tighnari: I see. Huh... Well, I figured that, given his temper, he would come here and berate me personally.
Khajeh: Tighnari, your master is an integral part of this effort, and now he requires your assistance.
Tighnari: And what exactly does my master need of me, Sage Khajeh?
Khajeh: You'll know, once you've arrived in Sumeru City, that is.
Tighnari: And how long will I be required to stay?
Khajeh: There's no definite answer as of now.
Tighnari: Do you mean to tell me that despite coming all the way here to Gandharva Ville, you still can't answer the questions I laid out in the letter to my master?
Tighnari: If that's the case, then I'm afraid I cannot give you a definite answer either.
Ghulam: Tighnari! But you—
Khajeh: *sigh* So be it... Come, Ghulam, we're leaving.
Paimon: Uh Tighnari, what was that all about?
Tighnari: It's nothing. Some people from the Akademiya wanted me to go to Sumeru City to assist them with a project, but I had to refuse on account of all my responsibilities here.
Tighnari: But all that can wait, how did things go with Haypasia?
Paimon: It was quite the eventful trip! But the main thing is that she's safe and sound. She answered a bunch of questions for us, too.
Tighnari: #Very good. Now that {NICKNAME} has made a full recovery, there shouldn't be any reason for you to tarry here longer. I assume you will be heading to Sumeru City, correct?
Paimon: That's right! We want to meet Lesser Lord Kusanali and ask her for advice. Do you have any idea on how we can find her?
Tighnari: Sorry, I'm afraid I don't have any advice for you there.
Paimon: Well, do you at least know anyone we can try asking in Sumeru City?
Tighnari: Hmm, let me think... My trips to Sumeru City have been fairly short, and most of my acquaintances are researchers...
Tighnari: Oh, how about this... I'll write you a letter of introduction that you can give to a researcher I know. He's from the Amurta Darshan and is adept at gathering information. Asking him might prove worthwhile.
Tighnari: Also, when you enter Sumeru City, you'll probably end up receiving something like this item here. I'm not sure if it will ever come in handy for you, but maybe you can give it a try.
Paimon: Oh? What is it?
Tighnari: It's called an Akasha Terminal. It's a tool produced by the Akademiya that utilizes the legacy of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. Some say that this item is the very basis of Sumeru's reputation as the City of Wisdom.
Tighnari: Needless to say, this device and its usage fall under the Akademiya's expertise, so I'll leave it to them to show you how to use it.
Paimon: Great! Next stop, Sumeru City! Ah, but wait, before that...
Traveler: We need to say goodbye to Collei.
Paimon: That's right! Tighnari, we have something important to say to Collei before we leave. Is she doing better now?
Tighnari: Yes, she's doing much better. After being confined to her bed all this time, I thought a little walk would do her some good. Last I saw her, she was taking the path towards the north crossing.
Tighnari: She knew you two would be leaving soon, so she must have wanted to see you off.
Paimon: Thanks, Tighnari! Alright, let's go.
Tighnari: Farewell, and good luck to you both.

## Talk 15

Collei: Ah, I've been waiting for you two.
Collei: I, uh... Well... ugh, never mind. I guess I should just wish you two a safe and successful journey.
Paimon: Thanks for waiting here just to see us off, Collei. We're headed to Sumeru City.
Traveler: Please take care of yourself, Collei.
Collei: Don't worry about me, I can take care of myself. My condition won't be getting in the way of my duties. I want to be a Forest Ranger, after all! It's up to me and the others to protect the rainforest here.
Collei: And uh, well I'm sorry... I should have told you both about my condition when we first met. I just wanted you two to treat me as a normal friend, not some girl that needs your sympathy...
Collei: But I guess now I understand that the most important thing is for friends to be genuine with one another.
Paimon: There's no need to apologize, Collei! We should be thanking you for trusting us enough to be your friends and sharing your past with us.
Paimon: We're probably still gonna worry about your condition, but that's because we're friends and we care about you!
Collei: Thank you, that means a lot... Uh, before you leave, I have something for you.
Paimon: Oh? What is it?
Collei: It's my recipe for Pita Pockets! I told you that I'd give you a copy, remember? My handwriting is a little messy, so please don't laugh.
Paimon: Yay, thanks Collei! Now we can eat those scrumptious little pitas whenever and wherever we like!
Collei: I hope that whenever you eat them, you'll both remember your time here in Gandharva Ville.
Traveler: Of course, we will!
Collei: Well then, I, Trainee Forest Ranger Collei, bid you both farewell. Please visit Gandharva Ville again. The rangers will always be ready to assist you here.
Traveler: We'll be back to see you soon, Collei.

## Talk 16

Paimon: Huh? How'd things out here end up looking like this?
Paimon: Wh—What happened!? And where are we?
Traveler: Relax, Paimon.
Paimon: Really? Oh, maybe you're right... Let's go investigate the area.
Traveler: There must be a logical explanation for all this.

## Talk 17

Abyss Herald: Hahaha! Well, well, well. Looks like we meet again, Traveler!
Paimon: Ah! The Abyss Herald! What are you plotting to do in this strange place?
Abyss Herald: Strange place? Plotting? Hehehe... You needn't worry about such things, they don't concern you!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Haypasia: So... hungry...

### Additional Talk 2

Haypasia: Heading out, I see? If there's anything else you'd ever like to ask about, you know where to find me.
Traveler: About dreams...
Haypasia: Even though that little neighbor of mine was able to induce a state of dreaming, I doubt they were able to control the actual contents of the dream.
Haypasia: The end of your dream seemed quite terrifying. Perhaps there's something that's troubling you deep inside...?
Haypasia: Not to worry, though, I'm sure you'll be able to handle whatever comes your way in the real world.
Haypasia: As someone from Sumeru who cannot dream, I needn't ever worry about nightmares. But lately, I've started to feel that I'm somehow missing something without dreams... Hehe, it's a little hard to explain.
Traveler: About Irminsul...
Haypasia: Sumeru researchers use Spirit Borneol to assist them in connecting with Irminsul to extract knowledge from it. Though the process can be risky, we believe that the knowledge gained is worth it.
Haypasia: Unfortunately, I cannot help you understand your dream, at least not yet. I'm still learning how to attune to the depths of Irminsul myself.
Haypasia: I hope that I'll be able to ascend past Satyavada Life and gain deeper insights.
Traveler: About your unusual neighbor...
Haypasia: I've heard local children here in the rainforest speaking of fairy-like creatures, but I'm from Sumeru City, and I've never heard of such things when I was a child.
Haypasia: Perhaps this is because I had a very strict upbringing. My parents would seldom allow me to play with other children. I doubt they'd ever believe me if I told them about my little neighbor out here.
Haypasia: And speaking of my little neighbor, I think they can somehow sense when Tighnari is coming to visit me.
Haypasia: I've noticed on several occasions that as they're playing under the trees, they'll suddenly tense up and scamper away for no apparent reason. Shortly after they do this, Tighnari always shows up here.
Haypasia: Hmm, perhaps I should ask Tighnari about this the next time I see him...
Traveler: Goodbye.
Haypasia: Take care. Do remember to come visit anytime you're in the area. I would be happy to chat with you.

### Additional Talk 3

Tighnari: Collei is waiting at the northmost crossing of Gandharva Ville. You should be able to find her there.
Traveler: About Collei...
Tighnari: Don't you worry about Collei, I'll look after her. I'll find a way to understand the relationship between The Withering and her disease.
Traveler: About the Akademiya's invitation...
Tighnari: It seems there's a major project underway at the Akademiya, and my master has also joined the effort.
Tighnari: But I can't afford to leave Gandharva Ville now. Things are not going well here in the rainforest, and Collei needs someone to watch over her. Besides, I never was one for all the pomp and circumstance of life at the Akademiya.
Tighnari: Given that my master hasn't come to give me an earful personally, it seems that my presence is not as sorely needed as they make it out to be. In fact, the letter he sent me was uncharacteristically polite...
Traveler: See you.
Tighnari: Farewell, Traveler.
