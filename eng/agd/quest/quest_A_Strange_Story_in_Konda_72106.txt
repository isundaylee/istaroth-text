# A Strange Story in Konda


## Talk 1

???: Excuse me, busy Traveler, but I have a favor to ask.
???: Please, look at the Sky Kitsune Statue over there.
???: There is a ward within it that they say can only be removed by someone who has courage, values friendship, and who is favored by the might of *Electro*.

## Talk 2

???: I was right. You are the "Destined One."
???: With your skills and experience... Mm, this shouldn't be a problem.
Hanachirusato: Excuse my rudeness. My name is Hanachirusato, and I am a shrine maiden.
Paimon: Do shrine maidens usually wear masks?
Hanachirusato: ...I have my reasons for that.
Hanachirusato: The village in front of you is named Konda Village, and there is a... barrier within it that needs to be lifted.
Hanachirusato: That barrier is hidden behind a certain secret. I'd like to entrust you with a little investigation, and with lifting that barrier.
Traveler: Investigation?
Hanachirusato: Yes. It may take some time and trouble, but I'm sure that you will reveal the truth in the end.
Paimon: Well, that sounds like a lot of work. Will there be payment?
Hanachirusato: Hehe... Of course.
Hanachirusato: "To those who seek shall just reward be given in proportion to their wisdom and work."
Hanachirusato: ...That's what she used to say. So no, there is no need to worry.
Traveler: "She"?
Hanachirusato: ...
Hanachirusato: I shall be counting on you for this investigation, Destined One.
Traveler: I see. I'll get a move on, then.
Traveler: Will there be a reward for that?

## Talk 3

Konda Densuke: I wrote down all the events at that time and the location of the key before throwing the notes onto the roof. You can read it yourself.
Konda Densuke: After entrusting the secret to a kind young person like you, I'm more relieved now...
Konda Densuke: *sigh* Did Konda Village become like this because I couldn't fulfill my duty to the gods?

## Talk 6

???: You were able to retrieve the ward... That means that you really are the "Destined One."
???: With your skills and experience... Mm, this shouldn't be a problem.
Hanachirusato: Excuse my rudeness. My name is Hanachirusato, and I am a shrine maiden.
Paimon: Do shrine maidens usually wear masks?
Hanachirusato: ...I have my reasons for that.
Hanachirusato: The village in front of you is named Konda Village, and there is a... barrier within it that needs to be lifted.
Hanachirusato: That barrier is hidden behind a certain secret. I'd like to entrust you with a little investigation, and with lifting that barrier.

Hanachirusato: Yes. It may take some time and trouble, but I'm sure that you will reveal the truth in the end.
Paimon: Well, that sounds like a lot of work. Will there be payment?
Hanachirusato: Hehe... Of course.

Traveler: I see. I'll get a move on, then.
Traveler: Will there be a reward for that?

## Talk 7

Hanachirusato: Greetings.
Traveler: About Konda Village...
Hanachirusato: Konda Village has a long history. In the distant past, its people were once charged with the duty of guarding a certain barrier.
Hanachirusato: But too many things have been lost to time, and this barrier has now become something that must be removed.
Hanachirusato: I wish you all the best.
Traveler: About the barrier...
Hanachirusato: There is a barrier under Konda Village. For the sake of Narukami Island, we must lift it.
Hanachirusato: However, the path to the barrier is shrouded in Konda Village's secrets.
Hanachirusato: I believe that you will see through the mystery of the villagers' words and reach the place appointed by destiny, just as you did with the ward...
Traveler: Goodbye.

## Talk 8

Takeru: Amazing, you climbed up so easily!
Takeru: #Hmmm...? Looking at you, mister, you should be an outlander, right?
Takeru: It's been a super long time since I've seen an outlander!
Takeru: Well then, speak: What can Konda Takeru do for you, O outlander from afar?
Paimon: What an arrogant little kid...
Traveler: Have you noticed anything strange lately?
Takeru: *shh* Keep your voice down... I can tell you, but promise me you won't get scared!
Takeru: During thunderstorms...
Takeru: ...things get spooky around here!
Takeru: There's a strange spooky ghost lady!
Traveler: Ooh.
Takeru: Huh, how can you be so calm after I told you something like that?
Takeru: When I told Grandpa Densuke, he didn't believe me either. He said that I must have been mistaken...
Traveler: Any other unusual things going on?
Takeru: I guess that would be the *broken cart* at the entrance of the village. I wonder who left it there?
Takeru: See, that's it over there. There are hilichurls digging at it, too!
Traveler: I'll say hi to her when I see her...

## Talk 9

Paimon: This must be the broken cart Takeru mentioned!
Paimon: But other than some tattered paper, Paimon doesn't see anything special here.
Paimon: Let's see... The contents of this piece of paper are... a Shogunate ledger of goods and payments...
Paimon: The goods are... "this book" blah blah blah... "participating in" blah blah... and the number is something-something volumes?
Paimon: It says "volumes," which must refer to things made of paper, right?

## Talk 10

Konda Densuke's Notes: (Most of the notes are illegible due to their exposure to the elements.)
Konda Densuke's Notes: "...But the lies and cover-up of this thievery weigh heavily on me. Therefore, I decide to leave these notes..."
Konda Densuke's Notes: "...The group attacked the public drunkenly, stealing no small amount of goods and some pouches of Mora..."
Konda Densuke's Notes: "...After much discussion, it was decided that this matter should be covered up... The cart was destroyed in the night. The goods and coin pouches were dumped down an empty well..."
Konda Densuke's Notes: "...The well was sealed and locked, and the key was hidden in *a broken house across the gully on the east side of the village*... Legend has it that it was built by Douin. Sadly, it's now so desolate that it proved a fitting choice to hide such a key..."
Konda Densuke's Notes: "...Konda Village should've been prosperous. The Konda Clan should've thrived... I hope... for the sake of Takeru and Futaba... this village shall remain free of mishaps..."

## Talk 11

Futaba: #Hello, strange {F#big sis}{M#big bro}! What's up?
Traveler: Have you encountered anything strange lately?
Futaba: Strange? Uh... I don't get it. What kinds of things would you consider strange?
Traveler: Anything out of the ordinary.
Futaba: Hmm... Hmm...
Futaba: I know!
Paimon: Did something come to mind?
Futaba: There's a weirdly dressed outlander and a floating white... thing talking to me!
Traveler: That is indeed strange.
Futaba: I know, right?
Paimon: Hey! You two!
Futaba: Okay, I'll be serious. One night, it suddenly started raining very heavily. Then, I heard a strange sound outside the house that accompanied the sound of the rain.
Traveler: Strange sound?
Futaba: Yes, it was like an intermittent clicking, clacking sound!
Futaba: The next day, I went to check it out! Then I saw some *floating bags* in the village gully.
Futaba: I left them alone because I didn't know who had put them there...
Futaba: They might have washed away by now. You can take a look along the gully!
Traveler: Were there any other clues?
Futaba: Other than that... I can't think of any.
Futaba: You can go ask my dad! He knows a lot of things.
Traveler: Your dad?
Futaba: *Konda Densuke*, the chief of Konda Village.
Paimon: Huh? That old man is your dad?
Futaba: Actually, I was adopted. He adopted me, so now I'm his daughter.
Futaba: Oh! You can also go ask my nephew, Takeru.
Paimon: Wait a second. Nephew...?
Traveler: I see. He is the village chief's grandson.
Futaba: That's right. *Takeru likes high places*, so maybe he's seen something from there...
Paimon: This family's pretty complicated...
Traveler: I see. Thank you.
Futaba: Hehe. Glad that I could help!
Futaba: *sigh* Why isn't Takeru here yet? We were supposed to hang out today.
Futaba: Did he go up to the roof again...?
Traveler: "Nephew"?
Futaba: My dad's grandson. I'm my father's daughter, so he's my nephew.
Traveler: Like something that is hard to explain.

## Talk 12

Paimon: Hmm... This must be one of the "floating bags" that Futaba mentioned!
Paimon: Hee-hee, let's see what's inside...

## Talk 14

Paimon: This should be Konda Village.
Paimon: Secrets... Hmm, yes, Paimon smells something suspicious!
Traveler: Paimon's nose is better than a dog's...
Paimon: How rude! Paimon was just saying the obvious.
Paimon: Hehe. It might look very peaceful here, but Paimon's sure that there's gotta be something dark going on.
Traveler: Really?
Paimon: There's gotta be some secrets here! Miss Masked Maiden said so.
Paimon: Anyway, let's talk to the locals first. Maybe we can find something out...
Traveler: Find out what?
Paimon: Hehehe, the secret that the people of Konda Village are trying to hide!
Traveler: A dark secret?
Paimon: That's right!
Traveler: Well done, Paimon.

## Talk 15

Saimon Eri: Hello, youngster. Are you here to listen to this old woman's stories?
Traveler: Have you encountered anything strange lately?
Saimon Eri: The strangest thing is how we haven't heard from Jirou for such a long time...
Saimon Eri: My old husband's even put up a search notice in Inazuma City.
Saimon Eri: *sigh* Jirou used to hang out with the young gangsters in the village.
Saimon Eri: We urged him to join the army because they were together from morning to night and were always up to no good.
Saimon Eri: Maybe the kid's broken off contact because we pushed him too hard...
Saimon Eri: Speaking of which, it seems like I haven't seen any of those punks for a while, either.
Traveler: Anything else out of the ordinary?
Saimon Eri: Out of the ordinary... Let's see...
Saimon Eri: In the past, traders and tourists from various countries would disembark at Ritou, and they would pass through our village on their way to Inazuma City.
Saimon Eri: The village was always busy and we would open our doors for outlanders. But that hasn't happened for a long time. That's unusual, isn't it?
Saimon Eri: Mr. Imatani never worried much about the kids in the past, nor would Jirou ever have fought any war no matter who told him to. This is also very abnormal.
Saimon Eri: And the deserted shrine at the foot of the mountain would never have fallen into disrepair in the past like it has now. I've heard that the statue of the Great Fox occasionally sheds tears. That's not normal either, is it?
Saimon Eri: The Konda family's well is always dry, even though there is plenty of water all around. Someone locked the well up the other night, and not a soul knows who did it. This kind of thing isn't normal either, right?
Saimon Eri: Little Takeru even said that he saw a ghostly woman during a stormy night. But who or what would haunt such a peaceful village? This too is very abnormal, yes?
Saimon Eri: ...
Saimon Eri: Hehehe... There are just too many strange goings-on for an old woman like me. Are these what you wanted to know?
Traveler: So, about the punks you mentioned earlier...
Paimon: Do you know where they are, Granny?
Saimon Eri: They're a band of troublemaking brats. They most likely went somewhere new to make trouble.
Saimon Eri: As long as Jirou isn't influenced by them, I couldn't care less.
Saimon Eri: Still, you just reminded me of something...
Saimon Eri: I've heard that for a while, there was a lot of Mora scattered inside *the dry well behind the village chief's house*.
Saimon Eri: But a group of ronin came to the village later and took almost all of it.
Saimon Eri: That's all I know. If you want to know more, you can go ask our village chief.

## Talk 17

Konda Densuke: What can I do for you, youngster?
Traveler: You are...?
Konda Densuke: My name is Konda Densuke, and I am the village chief.
Konda Densuke: From the way you dress, you must be an outsi— I mean, outlander, right? It's been a long time since an outlander has come to the village.
Konda Densuke: How can I help you? Need a place to rest your feet? Or do you need help to find your way up the mountain?
Traveler: I'm looking for a place to rest.
Paimon: No! We're here to ask about the secret of Konda Village!
Traveler: ...Oh boy.
Konda Densuke: Secret? Konda Village doesn't have any secrets.
Konda Densuke: Although the economy isn't good these days, all the taxes that should be paid to the police station are paid regularly, regardless.
Konda Densuke: There are only a few families in our village, all with a long history. And we know each other's roots. How could we have any secrets?
Traveler: Calm down a little...
Konda Densuke: Konda Village is simple and peaceful. There are no secrets here.
Konda Densuke: If you're looking for secrets, why don't you just go to the Grand Narukami Shrine and learn the secrets of deciphering fortune slips? Or how about you go to Chinju Forest and see if you can hear the "tanuki-bayashi," huh!?
Konda Densuke: Phew... Sorry, I might have overreacted.
Konda Densuke: Konda Village is a peaceful place. Youngster, are you sure you don't have the wrong village?
Paimon: But...
Konda Densuke: If you don't believe me, *you can look around yourself*. I, Konda Densuke, will not stand in your way.
Traveler: I want to go up the mountain.

Futaba: #Are you looking for those bags, {F#big sis}{M#big bro}? *If you follow the gully*, you might find them!

## Talk 20

Well Lock: (The dry well is locked and looks like it could be opened with the corresponding key...)

## Talk 21

Paimon: It's tightly locked, just like Granny said...
Paimon: Hmm? There seems to be something here...
Paimon: Wow! It's a marked coin pouch!
Paimon: #Traveler, are you thinking what Paimon's thinking?
Traveler: What's on your mind?
Paimon: Paimon's thinking about buying lots and lots of snacks with this Mora!
Traveler: I'm thinking that there shouldn't be a coin pouch here.
Paimon: Ah! You mean that we should make it disappear, right?
Paimon: Just kidding. Hmm, a coin pouch by the well... That means...
Traveler: Someone is hiding something.
Paimon: ...And this well's in the village chief's yard.

## Talk 23

Saimon Eri: Ah, look at this old lady, only focusing on talking about her own son...
Saimon Eri: Well, if you're interested in what's going on, go over to *the dried-up well* and check it out.

## Talk 24

Saimon Eri: Ah, it's you, youngster.
Saimon Eri: Thank you so much for helping us with Jirou.
Traveler: How is he doing?
Saimon Eri: He's doing well, thanks to you. But considering his situation, it's best that he doesn't come out to greet you for now.
Saimon Eri: Anyway, I'm glad that he came back alive. He told me what he went through... and it's a blessing that he met you.
Traveler: Have you encountered anything strange lately?
Saimon Eri: If I must say so, Jirou being as peaceable as his is now is most strange.
Saimon Eri: This is thanks to you, too.
Saimon Eri: *sigh* He used to hang out with the young gangsters in the village.
Saimon Eri: We urged him to join the army because they were together from morning to night and were always up to no good.
Saimon Eri: I thought that he would learn how to deal with people in the army, or at least understand how to be sincere with people, and stop giving others troubles.
Saimon Eri: He failed to learn any of that in the army, but his experience with you sure showed him a thing or two. Hehe...
Saimon Eri: If he gets restless again... I'll teach him a lesson.
Paimon: Whoa, so scary!
Traveler: Anything else out of the ordinary?
Saimon Eri: Out of the ordinary... Let's see...
Saimon Eri: In the past, traders and tourists from various countries would disembark at Ritou, and they would pass through our village on their way to Inazuma City.

## Talk 25

Takeru: How can I convince Grandpa Densuke that there really is a ghost...
Traveler: Tell him something weird...
Takeru: Besides the ghost? That would be *the broken cart at the entrance of the village*!

Konda Densuke: If you don't believe me, just check it out for yourself.

### Additional Talk 2

Konda Densuke: *sigh* You again...
Traveler: The villagers have told us everything...
Konda Densuke: They did? What did they say?
Konda Densuke: Don't you think you can fool an old man like me with these baseless accusations...
