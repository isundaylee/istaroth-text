Edwin Eastinghouse: Arkhium really has incredible research potential. I have to find a way to get in and take a look...

## Talk

Traveler: Whatever you do, you're not allowed to research Arkhium!
Edwin Eastinghouse: Ugh, why are you here? Don't you understand? That explosion before was just an accident. Arkhium still has plenty of potential as a subject of research.
Edwin Eastinghouse: And such incidents are inevitable during research. You lose a few researchers? Hire a few more. You destroy a lab? Build another. As long as the supply of Arkhium is guaranteed, I can get the research project up and running again.
Edwin Eastinghouse: ...Why are you looking at me like that? Did I say something wrong?

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Edwin Eastinghouse: Hmm... How can I get in?

## Talk

Traveler: It was your research that caused this tragedy.
Edwin Eastinghouse: Indeed, it was a tragedy. However, they sacrificed themselves for science, and I salute them.
Edwin Eastinghouse: But I must insist that you stop trying to pin that explosion on me. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I wasn't in the Central Laboratory at the time. I was out inspecting other departments.
Edwin Eastinghouse: Some knucklehead must have spilled a cup of coffee, or accidentally pulled the wrong lever. Who knows how those idiots screwed up? At any rate, they ruined my lab and the entire Arkhium project!

## Talk

Traveler: What about Loillier and Concini?
Edwin Eastinghouse: Financial backers for my research, that's all. They only cared about making Mora. They didn't understand the first thing about technology, and couldn't even handle simple tasks like procuring precision instruments.
Edwin Eastinghouse: I'd had enough. I was forced to assemble the instruments myself and rebuild the entire lab.
Edwin Eastinghouse: They ended up being more interested in Nacker's shoddy prototype, and they kicked me out of the lab!
Edwin Eastinghouse: They asked me to work on peripheral suppressors instead. How absurd!

## Talk

Traveler: You're the project leader. Don't try to evade responsibility.
Edwin Eastinghouse: Ha! So you came all this way just to lecture me?
Edwin Eastinghouse: I never asked to be the project leader. If the Institute hadn't imposed a deadline on my researchâ€”
Edwin Eastinghouse: I wouldn't have had to hire that gaggle of fools to assist me. If I had the time to personally oversee every project, that accident would never have happened!
Edwin Eastinghouse: Forget it. I won't waste any more of my time explaining it to you. When I get out of the Fortress of Meropide, I must get it through to the Institute to restart the research.

## Talk

Traveler: What carrot did they dangle in front of you?
Edwin Eastinghouse: Mora, fame, mansions, the whole nine yards. But I'm not interested in any of that.
Edwin Eastinghouse: Mora won't necessarily buy you any raw Arkhium, and fame won't attract top research assistants.
Edwin Eastinghouse: As for the mansions... maybe I'd consider it if they were filled with precision instruments, but that clearly wouldn't be the case.
Edwin Eastinghouse: I had no place to restart my research at the time, so I had to agree to rebuild the lab there.
Edwin Eastinghouse: And now, thanks to Nacker, I don't even have my lab anymore!

## Talk

Traveler: Will the Fontaine Research Institute take you back?
Edwin Eastinghouse: If I were Raimondo, I wouldn't let Edwin Eastinghouse himself be idle and outside the Institute.
Edwin Eastinghouse: Otherwise... Hmph! Does he really want the Institute to turn into a Fonta development factory?
Edwin Eastinghouse: But now that that Choiseul has moved his office into the Institute... He might try to stop me from returning...
Edwin Eastinghouse: I just want to conduct my own research in peace. Is that too much to ask?

Traveler: Whatever you do, you're not allowed to research Arkhium!

Edwin Eastinghouse: What are you looking at me like that for? Am I wrong? I know you saw that ship Jurieu built, the Wingalet or whatever.
Edwin Eastinghouse: Jurieu, Jurieu... And what energy source could he have used, if not Arkhium? That ship alone proves the value of the stuff!
Edwin Eastinghouse: Although if you ask me, that tub of his was underpowered. There's room for improvement in his catalytic processes... yes, that's right! The tech I already developed should have been used...
