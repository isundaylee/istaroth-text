Traveler: Your dad's a busy man, then?
Atzi: Not at all! All he does is walk around our encampment with his chest puffed out.
Atzi: And he always tells me not to make too much noise around the Saurians. Hmph! I bet he just wants me to stay at home and do homework all day, every day. That sure would be easier for him, huh...
Atzi: Hmph, well if he thinks I'll play ball with not playing ball, he's got another thing coming! I'm gonna go play hide-and-seek with the baby Saurians!
Atzi: But it's so hard to beat Iktomisaurs at hide-and-seek... If only there were some Tepetlisaurs nearby instead.

Traveler: What about your mother?
Atzi: She's a doctor, so she's super busy! She's often out working, and she even brings delicious food back home.
Atzi: But whenever she's not out, she takes me to see Granny Itztli...
Atzi: Mom always brings Granny Citlali cabbages, Grainfruit, and herbs. After that, she gets Granny to teach me some classes and leave me some homework...
Atzi: Granny's homework is always so hard... Y'know what? Come to think of it, it's best that adults stay busy!
