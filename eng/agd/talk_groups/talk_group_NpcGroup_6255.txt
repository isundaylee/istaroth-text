Anela: Oh, it's you. Did you make a trip out here just to have some fun with me?
Traveler: About what happened before...
Anela: You've reconsidered my invitation? Or are you thinking of something else?
Anela: If you're asking about Hampeq, all I can say is that he brought it on himself. Sure, his opponents were in the wrong, but is he really completely blameless?
Anela: Oh my! I hope it doesn't sound like I'm kicking him while he's down. Well, for the sake of my reputation, let's keep that between us for now.
Traveler: I've got other things to take care of, so I'll be going now.
Anela: Oh, really? Such a pity. You be careful out there~
