## Talk 1

Traveler: About Radish Veggie Soup...
Geri: Yes, that's my commission. Have you already prepared three bowls of Radish Veggie Soup?
Traveler: Yes, here they are.
Traveler: Not yet...
Geri: Alright, well bring them to me as soon as they're ready. I'm sure my sister would like to have some, too.

## Talk 2

Geri: Mmm, smells good. Just like I remember it...
Geri: Thank you so much, these are for you. I'm going to enjoy every spoonful.
