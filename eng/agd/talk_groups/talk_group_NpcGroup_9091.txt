Navia: Oh, hello hello!
Navia: This place is seriously cool! So you and Paimon have this whole space to yourselves? It must feel a little empty sometimes — maybe I should come and hang out more often? Hehe.

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Navia: I like this place a lot! It's really nice.
Navia: The scenery is wonderful, and I love what you've done with the interior — very tasteful. You never fail to impress.
Traveler: Thanks. Not quite as nice as your place, though.
Navia: Oh, don't be silly. It's not a competition.
Navia: Every home's character is unique to its owner. It's not a question of good or bad, just... personality.
Navia: Yeah, that sums it up nicely — your home is a reflection of your personality!
Navia: Just one look around here, and I can tell that this place belongs to you and Paimon.
Traveler: What kind of style do you like in a home?
Navia: Hmm... cozy and practical, I guess? Beyond that, I'm really not that picky.
Navia: Melus actually did most of the interior decor at my place. I've always been quite fond of his style, and now that I've gotten used to it, I'm reluctant to change things up.
Traveler: Well, if you like it here, you're welcome to visit whenever you want!
Navia: Really? Literally, whenever I want? Because I'll definitely be taking you up on that offer.
Navia: Don't worry, I'll make sure to always come with snacks. Home-made cookies, little cakes... and whatever else you like.
Navia: Oh, and I'm happy to bring enough for Paimon, too!

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Navia: Sure thing! I mean, that's the whole point of coming here to hang out.
Navia: Hmm... So, what's new with you? Anything in particular on your mind lately?
Traveler: Hats. Can we talk hats for a second?
Navia: Ah yes. We certainly can. You know, you should consider getting yourself a hat.
Navia: And I don't mean a hat to keep your ears warm or your head dry... I just think your hairstyle would look really neat with a hat!
Traveler: Well then, maybe we should go clothes-shopping together sometime.
Navia: Oh, sure! I'll take you to the best shop in all of Fontaine. Let me think... Yeah, you and Paimon could both do with fancy outfits for formal occasions, as well as a hat and a new pair of leather shoes...
Navia: Actually, come to think of it — how have you dressed for formal occasions in the past?
Traveler: We pretty much just wear the same thing all the time.
Navia: Really? Huh, that's a surprise... That's cool though. I like how you don't get hung up about that kind of thing.
Navia: I often find that people who don't stress about their appearance are the most chilled-out.
Navia: Whatever the world throws at them, they just take it as it comes — no nonsense, no pretensions. Honestly, I think that's pretty awesome.
Navia: I guess traveling the world instills that kind of confidence in you, huh? ...But still, let's definitely get you a nice hat and some leather shoes when we have the chance!

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Navia: Let's do something together! We could go on a hike, climb some trees, pet some cats, walk some puppies... I'm honestly down with whatever.
Traveler: Sure you can climb trees in that dress?
Navia: You'd better believe it! There might be quite a bit of skirt in the back, but it's not restricting.
Navia: I made sure of that before I bought it. I specifically asked the designer to make some alterations, so I could maintain freedom of movement.
Traveler: Have you ever had any pets?
Navia: I had a dog once, many, many years ago, but after she passed away from an illness, I never got another.
Navia: My papa named her "Shelly." There wasn't any special meaning to the name — we just happened to find her right after coming back from a trip to the seaside.
Navia: I loved that dog. We'd go out together all the time, and she'd take me on adventures through the abandoned pipes... She was really smart that way.
Traveler: You must miss her a lot.
Navia: Definitely. Sometimes, I have dreams where we're playing together again, but I usually get over it pretty quickly once I wake up.
Navia: I'm sure Shelly wouldn't want me to live in the past. She'd want me to move forward with my life and make more good friends.
Traveler: Good friends like... me?
Navia: Come on, that should go without saying! After all the life-and-death situations we've been through together? That definitely makes you one of my greatest friends of all time!
Navia: I doubt I'll make many more friends like you in my lifetime, so I'll cherish our friendship to the end.
Navia: Anyway, as your great friend, how about I bake a cake that has all of our names on it — you, me, and Paimon — and bring it here for us all to share?
Navia: Something tells me that Paimon would really enjoy that... So I'm willing to spoil her just this once!
Traveler: Can I call you one of my good friends?
Navia: Hahaha, please, we crossed that bridge a long time ago!
Navia: Why would I ask to hang out with you here if we weren't already great friends?

Traveler: Good night, Navia.
Navia: *yawn* Yeah, I'm getting really sleepy — I think I'm gonna turn in. G'night, don't stay up too late.

Navia: Oh wow! I always thought that these metal sheet houses were difficult to build anywhere else.
Navia: You never fail to impress.
Navia: This has put me in the mood to go fishing. Wanna join?

## Talk 7

Navia: Hmm... Have you ever noticed how all of Fontaine's restaurants seem to go for the same style of decor?
Navia: You can't judge a restaurant by how fancy the furniture is. It all comes down to the quality of the food.
Navia: #But since this is chez Traveler, I have no doubt that both the menu and the cooking are exceptional!
