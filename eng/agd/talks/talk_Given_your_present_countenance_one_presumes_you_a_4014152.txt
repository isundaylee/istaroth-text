Jiehu: Given your present countenance, one presumes you are missing some old friends again?
Houzhang: One cannot help but be reminded of them...
Jiehu: Pray, speak. Unburden yourself of these sentiments.
Houzhang: One simply wishes Menogias were alive to witness such peace alongside us.
Houzhang: He was so skilled in matters of craftsmanship. Kite-making would scarcely prove to be a test of his capabilities. Were he yet amongst the living, he could have opened a kite stall. One is certain it would have been an establishment rich not only in profit but also esteem.
Houzhang: And if, as in the past, he were unable to involve himself in matters of the mortal realm, we could sell the kites in his stead. When we finished, we could bring him back wine and partake in drink and good company...
Jiehu: Moon Carver. Those are now but fond moments in our memories.
Houzhang: ...Indeed. The dead are gone, so, as the representatives of the living...
Houzhang: Let us take in the sights for a bit longer, if just for his sake.
