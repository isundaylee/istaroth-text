# The Bake-Danukis' Gift

Katheryne: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, have you met two bake-danuki recently, by any chance? One of them carries a purple cloth bag, while the other has a yellow one...
Paimon: Ooh! You must be talking about Mamesuke and Shibasuke!
Katheryne: Ah, great, so you do know them.
Paimon: Um, did something happen to them?
Katheryne: Not really, they just made a bunch of gestures before giving me this...
Katheryne: I've heard that you once visited the Good Hunter with a bake-danuki from Inazuma, so I thought you might be friends. I think they wanted me to give this to you.
Paimon: Ooh! So this is a gift from Mamesuke and Shibasuke!
Paimon: Hehe, looks like their journey's off to a good start! Paimon wonders if we'll ever meet again...
