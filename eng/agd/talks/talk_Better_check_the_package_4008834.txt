Traveler: Better check the package.
Paimon: Yup, let's be on the safe side!
Bernhard: I'll take the package back to the Knights of Favonius and have it verified.
Black Screen Text: Bernhard took the package to the Knights of Favonius headquarters...
Bernhard: It's approved, Honorary Knight and Paimon! There was nothing wrong with the content of the package!
Bernhard: Captain Hertha told us not to worry. In previous years, people have made such anonymous donations at the charity sale.
Bernhard: But this is still a good reminder. Recently, we've been following the Treasure Hoarders very closely, and it's possible they could use this trick to get out of trouble.
Bernhard: When Captain Hertha heard about it, she also made a donation to the sale from her own pocket to show her encouragement.
Paimon: Paimon sees... So the package is alright! Thanks to this mysterious kind soul. Paimon wishes him good fortune every day!
