Paimon: Whoa... This is not what Paimon was expecting...
Traveler: It looks familiar.
Paimon: Ah, this is creepy... Feels like there are loads of eyes staring at us...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Calm, yet repressed... The signs are all there...
Paimon: What is it, Mizuki? Figured something out?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Nothing new â€” just further confirmation of my suspicions. Emura Ichigensai should be hiding deep inside this place... Stay close to me.
