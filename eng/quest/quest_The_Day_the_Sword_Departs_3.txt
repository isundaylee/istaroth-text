# The Day the Sword Departs


## Talk 1

Sun Yu: Traveler, thank goodness you're here. I almost thought you wouldn't be back today.
Sun Yu: Today is the day I depart from Liyue Harbor. I have troubled you so much before... I have to thank you properly.
Sun Yu: ...
Sun Yu: Ahem... I was just thinking about what to say after seeing you.
Sun Yu: Now it's time for me to actually talk, I somehow don't even remember any of the words... Look at me, making a fool of myself even now, haha.
Traveler: Don't worry about it. I'm sure we'll meet again soon.
Sun Yu: Really? Haha, that's wonderful news! I'll show you around when you get there!
Sun Yu: Well, I actually still have one last favor to ask. You have a Kamera, right? Do you mind taking a picture for me?
Sun Yu: A sailor told me that it's best to keep a picture of your hometown with you when you are traveling abroad.
Sun Yu: But I don't own a Kamera, so maybe you'd be kind enough to help me out.
Traveler: No problem.
Traveler: Strike a pose!
Sun Yu: P—Pose!? I—It's about the scenery behind me!
Traveler: I'll pay you a visit in Fontaine sometime.

## Talk 2

Sun Yu: Thank you, Traveler. This picture is just perfect.
Sun Yu: ...
Sun Yu: *sigh* It's finally time to go. When I hear people say things like "A great man is ready to realize his aspiration anywhere," or "It is better to travel ten thousand miles than to read ten thousand books," I always feel so encouraged and inspired...
Sun Yu: But when it is me who's finally about to set out, I don't feel encouraged or inspired at all. All I want to do is to stay here for a little longer...
Sun Yu: Traveler, do you think I can find what I'm looking for during this journey?
Traveler: I don't know.
Sun Yu: Hahaha... I mean, what am I even looking for? Do I even know it myself?
Sun Yu: Right, it's about time. I'm going to meet up with that merchant. Please, Traveler, take these as your reward.
Sun Yu: Que'er... She's not here after all...
Traveler: It's all up to you.
Sun Yu: So... you are saying it's all up to fate.
