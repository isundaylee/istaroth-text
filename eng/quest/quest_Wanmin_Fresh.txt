## Talk 1

Traveler: Sorry, I'm busy.
Chef Mao: Right, then I'll go look for somebody else...

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'll deliver it right now.
Chef Mao: I'll leave it to you, then.
Chef Mao: Do be careful while you're making the delivery. This dish is rather delicate â€” <color=#00E1FFFF>if you run too fast or bump into something, you might scatter the ingredients</color>.
Chef Mao: If that happens, I doubt the customer would accept it.

Tacit Tingfang: Not... here yet...

## Talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: Ah, right. Yes, someone named Tingfang did order Jade Parcels from me.
Chef Mao: He paid quite promptly, and asked that I deliver it to him near Guyun Stone Forest at a later time.
Chef Mao: But I need to man the restaurant at the moment. So, could you deliver it to him for me?
