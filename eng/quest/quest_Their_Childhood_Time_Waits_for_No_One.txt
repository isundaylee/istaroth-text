# Their Childhood: Time Waits for No One


## Talk 1

Verut: Brother, let's hide over there. I bet it'll be better than the location she picked!
Aurele: Hey, Verut, stay close to me! If you get lost, I won't be able to find you right away, you know!
Traveler: What are you two doing here?
Verut: Hey, it's you! Are you free by any chance? C'mon, hide with us! Lovi's probably hidden herself already.
Traveler: Tell me about Lovi...
Verut: There's no time, c'mon! She knows this place really well... We need to find a better hiding spot!
Black Screen Text: Verut leaves in a hurry...
Aurele: *sigh* Verut... When will he listen...
Aurele: Sorry, but I'll have to trouble you to go another round with us. Verut's really excited, for... whatever reason...
Traveler: Maybe it's because he's found a new friend.
Aurele: My thoughts exactly. Still, so long as he's happy, it's all good...
Aurele: Let's hope he doesn't get too excited and follow Lovi to hide in some strange spot or another...
Aurele: My apologies, but please, do play hide-and-seek with us again.
Aurele: I guess I should find a place to hide myself, or Verut will be upset... and if he cries right in the middle of the street, I'll be all out of options...
Black Screen Text: Aurele leaves...
Traveler: Tell me about Lovi...
Aurele: A girl we just met. She saw us playing hide-and-seek, and she insisted on joining in.
Aurele: Her personality's quite like Verut's, so they get along like a house on fire.
Aurele: In any case, her father doesn't seem to have much time to play with her either, so I guess we're all in the same boat there.
Traveler: Still playing hide-and-seek, are we?

## Talk 2

Aurele: ...I think I've read this page before.
Traveler: You're reading?
Aurele: Huh. You sure arrived quickly. I had only just started reading.
Aurele: Lovi's father got her to pass this book to me. He even said that I could ask him about anything I didn't understand in it.
Aurele: But in truth... Heh. What is there in this book that I *do* understand...
Aurele: Anyway, leaving that aside, I'll head back to our meeting point. You did find me, after all, and the rules are the rules.
Traveler: You're quite an avid learner, aren't you?

## Talk 3

Verut: Agh, you found me so quickly! I was just planning on switching locations...
Verut: Now I'll have to go back to the meeting point...

## Talk 4

Lovi: Ugh, so you found me... Huh? Wait, who are you?
Traveler: A friend of Aurele and Verut.
Lovi: Oh! They mentioned you before... Verut said you're really good at this.
Lovi: Well, guess I got to see it for myself today. You really are good at this, huh?
Lovi: You got me good. Guess I'll head back to the meeting spot, then.

## Talk 5

Aurele: Why are you looking at me like that?
Verut: You were secretly reading a book again, weren't you? You weren't playing seriously at all!
Lovi: That's right. Come on! Be serious!
Aurele: Well, the two of you took the good spots, and I'm not very good at this... so I just went to read to pass the time, you know?
Verut: Bleh! You're a lying liar!
Lovi: Hmph! Bookworm!
Aurele: Seriously? Spare me...
Traveler: Alright, let him be.
Verut: Hehe, Lovi's really good at hide-and-seek. She knows all sorts of interesting hiding spots.
Verut: Hehehe, this place is pretty awesome when Lovi's around!
Lovi: Verut climbs walls super fast, and he's really strong. He gave me a hand quite a few times.
Lovi: As long as we go together, I bet no one but you would be able to find us!
Aurele: Alright, I think we're more or less done for the day. Let's send you home first, Lovi.
Lovi: And then... you're gonna ask my dad questions again, right?
Aurele: Wâ€”Well, there are some things that I'll need to consult him about, you know...
Lovi: Well, sure, my dad's definitely going to be home right now, so let's head back. My mom said that the two of you should stay for dinner, you know...
Traveler: Weren't you two having fun anyway?

## Talk 6

Lovi: You found me again...
Lovi: Verut's right, you're no ordinary person...
Lovi: You got me good. Guess I'll head back to the meeting spot, then.
