Brother Qian: Are you the Master of the Liyue branch?
Brother Qian: No, I'm not the Master. I'm just a volunteer that helps take care of her more trivial matters, which oftentimes ends up being an arduous and thankless task.
Brother Qian: You want to know why...? Heh, that's right, I'm in love with her.
Brother Qian: She's not at all like those delicate and helpless-looking girls. No, it's her strong and resolute character that I'm crazy about...
Brother Qian: It goes without saying that someone of the Guild Master's disposition won't be easily won. But to me, this is like the ultimate game of chance.
Brother Qian: Chasing that thrill is what drives any gambler. The higher the stakes, the more we strive to score the jackpot, no matter the odds. You know what I mean?
