# Beneath the Secret Source


## Talk 1

Paimon: Mavuika!
Mavuika: #Traveler, Paimon, Citlali — perfect timing. I've located The Captain.
Paimon: R—Really? That's great! We also just took a peek at Ororon's memories, and discovered something huge!
Paimon: Oh, uh... all with his Granny's permission, of course! Or, no, actually it was—
Citlali: Calm down, Paimon. I'll take it from here...
Mavuika: So, The Captain was searching for the Source Mechanism to reconstruct the Ley Lines.
Mavuika: If his plan is already in motion, that means he knows exactly how to accomplish his goal. We have to stop him.
Paimon: I—Is reconstructing the Ley Lines a bad thing?
Mavuika: Yes. It's not a simple fix. It would mean sacrificing nearly everything contained within the current Ley Lines — very similar to the price of using a Gnosis.
Mavuika: If he activates the mechanism, it's all over. We need to mobilize our forces as soon as possible.
Paimon: But, what forces do we have?
Mavuika: Kinich, Xilonen, you two, and myself. All other warriors are working to push back the Abyss on the frontlines.
Paimon: But, that's barely any people. Not to mention, you lost your power, and they've got The Captain on their side! Maybe we really should get Citlali to break Ororon's legs...
Mavuika: That won't help us with The Captain, I'm afraid. In any case, the Masters of the Night-Wind are in urgent need of manpower. Citlali, I was hoping you could head back and help defend the tribe.
Citlali: ...Alright. I understand where I'm needed. I'll head out right away.
Paimon: Don't worry about your grandson. We'll figure something out for sure!
Citlali: ...I'll leave him to you all, then.
Mavuika: Alright, back to the matter at hand. I don't believe defeating The Captain needs to be our ultimate goal.
Mavuika: Let me grab Xilonen and Kinich. Then, I'll tell you my idea.
Mavuika: As you all know, Ororon is working with The Captain, and we need to stop their plan.
Mavuika: The Captain is a formidable opponent, but that shouldn't deter us. In any case, a head-on confrontation isn't the best way to solve the issue.
Mavuika: Their plan hinges entirely on a single element — the Source Mechanism. If we leverage our forces, we can destroy it. And then, success is ours.
Mavuika: We'll head out together. In the event that a confrontation becomes inevitable, I'll stall The Captain while you advance.
Kinich: No, you're our leader, and you've lost your power. You shouldn't be the one to face The Captain.
Xilonen: I agree with Kinich. The two of us can handle it.
Mavuika: Listen to my plan, first. Kinich, I want you and Ajaw to launch an assault from the front and break through the Fatui defenses.
Mavuika: The Captain won't be on the frontlines. As a seasoned warrior, he'll be stationed in close proximity to the device to ensure its protection.
Kinich: So, you want us to lure him to the front?
Mavuika: No, the purpose of the frontal assault is to gather the Fatui forces in one place. That way, it's easier for the rest of us to avoid them.
Mavuika: Xilonen, I need you to do what your tribe does best, and dig a tunnel from the outskirts of the ruin. Once we get close to the device, we just need to destroy it.
Kinich: So, Xilonen is launching the main assault.
Mavuika: #Exactly. Traveler and I will join her, as well.
Mavuika: No one can create a distraction better than you, Kinich — not even myself. By combining our strengths, we just might manage to break through The Captain's defenses.
Kinich: Leave it to me.
Xilonen: Understood. Then, we should head out now.
Xilonen: Just promise us you won't do anything reckless. You cannot face The Captain straight on unless you have no other choice.
Xilonen: You mean everything to us. Losing you would be the worst possible outcome.
Traveler: I'll also try my best to not let things get to that point.
Mavuika: Thank you, everyone. You have my word — I'll proceed with caution.

## Talk 2

Mavuika: Alright, this is the place. Their tunnel must be behind that gathering of Fatui guards.
Xilonen: Any of the nearby mountains could be a good infiltration point. But, if we want to stay under the radar, we should approach from the side.
Kinich: As agreed, Ajaw and I will handle things at the front.
Mavuika: There are only a few Fatui stationed around the perimeter. We should take care of them first, so they can't alert anyone.

## Talk 3

Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: You come to me with many questions, and you should be rewarded for your bravery. Ask and you shall have the knowledge you seek.
Traveler: About the power of the heavens...
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: They do not like being mentioned by name by any living being, be it an ordinary human or one of The Seven. They prefer to remain in the shadows as Shades.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: The one you wish to know about... I call her "The Ruler of Death." She helped Natlan establish the rules. It was also under her guidance that I created the Night Kingdom...
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: It was an expression of love, as well as an act of reparation. She was seen as having significantly overstepped her authorities as a Shade, which quite displeased the almighty... Mm, Heavenly Principles.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: She succumbed to self-pity as a result, and no longer cared if others discussed her identity. Even so, her existence remains unknown to all but a select few.
Paimon: Self-pity...
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: ...Please don't tell anyone I used that word. I'm just trying to speak plainly to conserve energy...
Traveler: About the Loom of Fate...
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: I'm not familiar with that concept. The device is capable of weaving and creating Ley Lines, you say?
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Even I cannot create something from nothing. I can only reconstruct the Ley Lines by reassembling the yet-intact components into a new structure...
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: If that power were available to the people of Natlan, they might have a new option against the Abyss.
Traveler: About Elemental energy and the Abyss...
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Phlogiston is Teyvat's primordial form of energy. The Heavenly Principles used phlogiston as a basis for the creation of Elemental energy... to develop a power to better counter the Abyss.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Have you heard of the concepts of the Light Realm and the Human Realm? Hmm... That explanation might take too long.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Light refracts into seven different colors, which we collectively refer to as a rainbow. Elemental energy is a similar concept. It's essentially the modern counterpart of Phlogiston...
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: About my Ancient Name...
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Ah, yes, yes. The artisan from the Children of Echoes has yet to mention the matter to me, probably because the young girl from the Masters of the Night-Wind is absent.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: No matter. I'll reach out in a dream and tell them what needs to be done.
Paimon: Young girl...?
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: What? Did I say something wrong?
Traveler: I have no more questions.

## Talk 4

Mavuika: What do you think, Xilonen? Is this a good spot?
Xilonen: Looks good. We'll take it from here.
Black Screen Text: Keeping as quiet as possible, tribespeople from the Children of Echoes make quick work of digging a tunnel.
Totec: I can see the inside!
Xilonen: Perfect. We'll keep going. The rest of you should head back. Things are about to get dangerous.
Totec: Alright. Please take care!

## Talk 5

Mavuika: This spell is from the Masters of the Night-Wind. It's Ororon's doing. They're probably trying to buy time.

## Talk 6

Xilonen: This must be it.
Paimon: There they are!
Xilonen: (The Captain's here too. Perfect... looks like they focused their defenses over there.)
Ororon: They're here.
"The Captain": Huh, I thought the Pyro Archon would choose a frontal assault.
Ororon: It doesn't matter. They're too late anyway.
Mavuika: Stop!
"The Captain": It's too late.
Xilonen: We need to turn it off!
Traveler: (There's still time!)
Ororon: I won't let you do this!
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night (???): —!!!
Ororon: !?
"The Captain": The sound of... lament?
Paimon: What was that sound? It was like a piercing cry...
Xilonen: (Now's our chance to turn off the device!)
Traveler: (So close... We need to approach from the side and lure The Captain away...)
Xilonen: (Ororon!? How did he just—)
"The Captain": ...!
Xilonen: (His movements have gotten a lot faster... Was Ororon always this good in battle?)
Ororon: Hmph!
Traveler: Xilonen!
Xilonen: Ugh...
"The Captain": This ends now!
Ororon: Ugh!
Paimon: Huh?
Mavuika: ...Something's wrong.
Traveler: (The Captain helped Xilonen? Why?)
"The Captain": ...
Ororon: ...
"The Captain": You are not Ororon. Who are you?
Xilonen: What?
Ororon: ...Commander.
"The Captain": You...
Ororon: So, you still recognize me, Commander... I'm glad. Although, I believe you have some more pressing concerns at the moment.
Traveler: (Now!)
Paimon: We did it!
Ororon: You see? You indulge your sense of honor for just a moment, and now you've lost your chance... Even now, you're still the same as ever.
Paimon: His voice is completely different. Is... Is someone inhabiting Ororon's body...?
Ororon: Stop worrying about other people's survival, about their losses and sacrifices. You just need to win! That must be why I've returned... for this moment.
Ororon: Please finish what you've set out to do, Commander.
"The Captain": ...
"The Captain": I didn't expect to see you here, but I have to disagree... Abandoning one's comrades is not the way of a warrior.
Ororon: Why do you care about a doomed man? I know you can see it... He's already close to death.
Ororon: After all, his soul has been incomplete from the start.
Mavuika: Hmph.

## Talk 7

Ororon: (Someone said I'm close to death... Is it because of that noise just now? The piercing cry that came from underground when I activated the device...)
Ororon: (What's down there? Natlan's Ley Lines must be hiding some kind of secret.)
Ororon: (Argh... Am I dying? No, it's too soon...)
Kunnau: Ah! Ororon, it's you! What'll it be today?
Kunnau: *sigh* Why the long face? Don't tell me you still haven't let that go? I knew it was a bad idea to tell you.
Ororon: I... I heard everyone wanted me to be the savior.
Kunnau: Savior? Hah, sounds nice, doesn't it? But, does such a person truly exist? Even if they do, why would you have to become that person?
Kuymi: Ororon, is that you? Here, have a seat. Let Granny cut you some fruit. We just got a fresh batch.
Kuymi: Can I get you anything else? Some grilled meatloaf, maybe? Ask for anything you want — we've got plenty of ingredients.
Ororon: What about those spice-rubbed mushrooms you made last time, Granny Kuymi?
Kuymi: Ah, you liked those, did you? An outlander taught me that recipe, actually — a merchant, to be exact.
Kuymi: Ever thought about going into business yourself, my boy? You could travel all over.
Kunnau: Our Ororon... a merchant? He's far too honest for that line of work.
Kuymi: Well, at least an honest merchant like him wouldn't prey on old-timers like us!
Ororon: ...
Ororon: (Everyone said a true savior does not really exist, but then, why did my birth open the door to the possibility? Why give people false hope?)
Ororon: (Maybe I don't need to sacrifice myself, but surely everyone is born for a purpose... So what's mine?)
Ororon: (If I had succeeded back then, would the world have become a better place? What's the meaning of my existence?)
Citlali: Done spacing out, Ororon? Did you finish your homework?
Ororon: Yes, Granny. It's just... will learning all this really make me as strong as you?
Citlali: Hah, of course not! I'm a special case. Other shamans study their whole lives without reaching a fraction of my abilities.
Ororon: Because you're a genius, right?
Citlali: You could say that... Haha, or maybe I've just been alive longer than the rest of them, and picked up a few tricks that they didn't want to touch...
Citlali: Ahem! It's rude to bring up a woman's age. Never do that again, no matter the circumstances.
Ororon: Uh... I wasn't the one who brought it up...
Citlali: Anyway, class is canceled tomorrow. Go have fun.
Ororon: What about my homework, then?
Citlali: Do what you want. What use is it being as strong as me, anyway?
Citlali: You've seen how the tribe treats me. They're all afraid. I try to go about my business, and they practically tremble in fear... Not the most fun way to go about living one's life, I'd say.
Citlali: Take it from me, the happiest people are the ones who do their own thing. So, do what you want, Ororon, no matter what anyone else has to say.
Ororon: (Granny didn't say it outright, but I think she was trying to comfort me. Don't force yourself, don't beat yourself up over the past... That's what she always says.)
Ororon: (But, I never forced myself. I never even got the chance to try before it was all over.)
Ifa: Hey, you zoning out over here, again? There's such a thing as overwatering the radishes, you know!
Ororon: I was just looking at the aphids.
Ifa: Something interesting about them today?
Ororon: I noticed some on the ground. Maybe it got too cold yesterday, and they couldn't handle it.
Ifa: Bummer. Guess that means less honey this year.
Ororon: Ifa, do you think being a vet is fun?
Ifa: Fun? I'm not sure about that. Do you think planting vegetables is fun?
Ororon: Fun enough, I guess. I don't have anything else to do.
Ifa: Exactly. Most people live like that — no special purpose or calling. That's just how the world works.
Ifa: Oh, geez, that troublemaker's at it again... Ororon, my man, come inside and give me a hand, would you?
Ororon: Why should I? I thought being a vet was no fun.
Ifa: Well, I guess there is a fun part — trying to outsmart these rascals! C'mon, give me a hand!
Ororon: (Maybe Ifa was just too nice to tell me the truth... that attempting something above your capabilities will kill you.)
Ororon: (My soul is unstable. I only survived because I had people to help keep me in one piece.)
Ororon: (...A part of me has always been missing. That's why the other spirit said I was close to death. But...)
Guthred: Why struggle? It's a miracle you were even born. Just close your eyes and wait for death.
Ororon: It was you... the thing that came out of nowhere.
Guthred: Thing? I'm a warrior, far stronger than a weakling like you.
Ororon: I'm not weak. There's just a limit to what I can do.
Guthred: And that's exactly why your fantasy is so ridiculous. You really think a useless thing like you can save the world?
Ororon: Useless...
Ororon: (But, I don't want things to end here.)
Gajere: Ororon? It's alright. We'll take things from here.
Ororon: (Every time they marched to battle, I had to stay behind.)
Gajere: Don't worry. With the Archon on our side, the Abyss doesn't stand a chance!
Ororon: (All the best warriors are fighting on the frontlines... I want to do my part, too.)
Guthred: Both of us are bound to disappear. But, your end will come sooner than mine, because you've been broken from the start.
Guthred: Once your soul shatters into pieces and dissipates into the wind, I will take temporary control over this body. I will serve my commander until the end.
Ororon: No... NO! This isn't right. My life can't end like this — I still haven't done anything important with my life!
Ororon: My end will not come first, and I'm not giving up. I can't die here... No! I WON'T die here!
Mavuika: ...Ororon! Ororon!
Ororon: (That voice...)
Mavuika: Control your mind. Feel the ground beneath your feet! This is not your end.
Ororon: ...
Ororon: ...I...
Paimon: His eyes are open! He's alive!
Mavuika: Well done. You managed to do the impossible.
Ororon: What do you mean...
"The Captain": Don't try to talk. Focus on holding yourself together.
Ororon: ...
Xilonen: I can't believe The Captain did that...
Paimon: Maybe he thinks of Ororon as a comrade? He was helping to rein him in all this time...
Traveler: (That's the only reason I had the chance to turn off the device.)
Ororon: I... I'm fine now.
Mavuika: Damage to the soul is a tricky thing. The pain almost consumed you for a moment, but you managed to hold onto yourself... That's no easy feat.
"The Captain": The worst appears to be over.
Ororon: I'm sorry for causing so much trouble.
Mavuika: We can talk about that later.
Ororon: Our plan... It failed, didn't it.
Ororon: I'm sorry... We were so close.
"The Captain": You saved my life, and now... the debt is repaid.
Mavuika: Ororon, I never thought you actually wanted to sacrifice yourself in that ceremony. But, you never gave up. Have you come to a conclusion on what it is that you truly want?
Ororon: I just want an answer... a reason why I exist, and why everyone always did so much for me.
Ororon: No one is born a hero, and no one should be treated like one from birth. I had a chance to do something important back then, but I failed. All I want is to find some more ways to make up for that...
Mavuika: The answer you seek... now lies before you.
Ororon: ...!
Sanhaj: You are the inheritor of my name, the hero from the Masters of the Night-Wind who shall fight for this generation.
Sanhaj: Fascinating... You're not the person that the others thought you were. And yet... you're also not the kind of person that you thought you were. It can take a lifetime to truly discover who we really are.
Sanhaj: Like you, I never thought I had what it took to be a hero. I was too cunning, too self-absorbed. But, in the end, I sacrificed my life for this nation.
Sanhaj: Now, remember your name. Even if others will see a different meaning, it still symbolizes your nobility and yearning.
Ororon: My Ancient Name... "Bid{RUBY#[D]Devotion}ii."
Sanhaj: It means "devotion." You will give your all not for the sake of a heroic death, but to do justice by the answer you've found for your life.
Sanhaj: For that answer, you will offer all of your strength, and be born anew. Through your devotion, you will prove your worth.
Sanhaj: "Having foretold his own death, the omniscient man holds a feast in celebration."
Sanhaj: "Let us raise our cups in honor of his heroism and send him off with this final tribute."
Sanhaj: "For, at last, his wish is now fulfilled."
Mavuika: It's nice to see you again, Sanhaj. With your recognition, we now have the fifth hero of this era.

## Talk 8

Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night (???): I'm happy to see your plan advance one step further. It seems that my cry did not cause irreversible damage.
Ororon: Wh—What is that voice?
Mavuika: Just as I thought... The Lord of the Night has awakened.
Paimon: The Lord of the Night? As in... the one who rules over the Night Kingdom!?
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: I preside over a realm of souls. Due to my limited power, sleep is the only way I can extend my existence.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: When you activated the device, I awoke and could not hold back my cry. It is a sound that agitates souls.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Most of you were unaffected because your souls are intact. But, with a damaged soul, the effect on your friend was heightened, and his soul almost shattered as a result.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: And yet, his soul remains in one piece. He managed to overcome this obstacle through sheer strength of will... A truly impressive feat for a human.
Xilonen: So, was that what caused all his strange behavior earlier?
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: No. An additional soul was affected. It tried to take refuge in the missing part of your friend's soul, but was ultimately expelled.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: However, this soul does not hail from Natlan or the Night Kingdom. Its origins remain a mystery to me.
"The Captain": Activating the Source Mechanism was supposed to reconstruct the Ley Lines. Why did it awaken you instead?
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Because I was the one who originally constructed Natlan's Ley Lines... otherwise known as the Night Kingdom.
Mavuika: The ancient battle between the Descender and the dragons destroyed the corner of the world, allowing the Abyss to invade. Natlan's Ley Lines took the worst of the damage.
Mavuika: To aid the people of Natlan, the Lord of the Night used the fragments of the old Ley Lines to reconstruct a similar network. That's how the Night Kingdom was born.
Mavuika: The first Pyro Archon, Xbalanque, strengthened that realm and established the rules that aid our fight against the Abyss — the Ode of Resurrection and the Pilgrimage, both of which are practices that survive to this day.
Paimon: Oh, right... You said before it all came from the "power of the heavens."
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: The ancient dragons tried to use this device to strengthen the Ley Lines by imbuing them with power.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Back then, this method was rather ineffective. They lacked the skills to navigate the intricate structure of the Ley Lines.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: And now, the structure of the Ley Lines has also completely changed. I am the only possible vehicle for the power generated by the device.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: It was an incredibly crude and painful method, but I managed to absorb some of that power. Now, I can speak to you like this and provide you with aid.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Such as rebuilding the Ley Lines once more... at the cost of my own existence.
Paimon: But, why would you make that kind of sacrifice?
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: The people of Natlan worship me, and call me their "lord"... In the ancient past, before we died out, we were also known by a different name... "Angels."
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: But, adventurers like you are probably more familiar with our devolved form... Seelies.
Traveler: So, Seelie are angels...
Paimon: No wonder there are Seelies around here. A Seelie also helped us in the Night Kingdom...
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Few angels remain in Natlan, so the same is true of Seelies. Everyone rallied around me and offered their power to humanity to reconstruct the Ley Lines.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Now, I have witnessed your determined pursuit for survival, and I have become your faith... I am very pleased.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Mavuika, inheritor of Xbalanque's will, and leader of Natlan...
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Despite all the obstacles and misunderstandings, I have awoken, and the efforts of this Harbinger and the young hero have imbued me with power.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Say the word, and I will once again work to fulfill my mandate, just as I did thousands of years ago.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: You need only nod your head. For the sake of your people and your nation, for the sake of overcoming the invasion from the Abyss, give me your orders.
Mavuika: ...I will not.
Mavuika: After reconstructing new Ley Lines, you will cease to exist. The rules of Natlan are founded in the Night Kingdom. If you disappear, so do they.
Mavuika: Not to mention, all the memories and legends recorded within the old Ley Lines will disappear along with you. The people of Natlan will face memory loss, mental disorders, and cognitive issues...
Mavuika: Just like the consequences of using the Gnosis, that is a price I refuse to accept.
"The Captain": Humanity's survival is worth any price. Once the Abyss runs rampant, all that remains will be a land of corpses and ruin.
Mavuika: And when the new Ley Lines are invaded again by the Abyss? What then? How are future generations supposed to survive?
Mavuika: A land without the Lord of the Night, without the protection of the rules... is doomed from the start.
"The Captain": You presume too much. If you cannot ensure survival in the present, you have no right to think about the future.
"The Captain": What will it take for you to realize that? How many hundreds or thousands will have to die!?
Paimon: The situation hasn't gotten that dire yet... has it?
Traveler: Why are you so pessimistic about the situation?
"The Captain": Why...? Because I am a survivor of Khaenri'ah. I've witnessed the devastation and terror of the Abyss with my own eyes.
Ororon: ...
Paimon: Khaenri'ah...
"The Captain": That's right. My family, my comrades, my homeland... were all lost to the Abyss.
"The Captain": It is an unforgettable pain, one that no amount of time could ever dull... not even five hundred years. You've experienced something similar, Mavuika. You should know exactly what I mean.
Mavuika: You're right. The pain, the regret, the catastrophe... they all haunt my dreams to this day...
"The Captain": If I could go back, I would reject all false hope. I would do whatever it took to ensure their survival.
"The Captain": You have that chance before you now. Why do you refuse to take it!?
Mavuika: Because we don't have the right to make that decision.
Mavuika: We love this world because it contains everything we hold dear... everything that has happened here has moved us, shaped us, and turned us into who we are today.
Mavuika: Giving up our memories and history would mean rewriting everything. The people of this world would then become fundamentally different beings, their physical bodies the only connection to their former selves.
"The Captain": Even so, given enough time, a new civilization would inevitably flourish. If you believe in humanity, you should trust in their ability to create a new future.
Mavuika: Or, history could repeat itself, the Abyss could invade once more, and it would all be for nothing.
Ororon: Can I say something?
Ororon: I once carried the hopes of many people, and I was also desperate to save our nation. In The Captain's plan, I saw a chance to ensure our survival.
Ororon: But, as I was on the brink of death, my wish for life and purpose was rekindled.
Ororon: I've been very fortunate to be well cared for by all the people in my life. I refuse to forget that. My feelings were so strong, they overrode my compulsion to sacrifice myself for their safety.
Ororon: No matter what path lies before us, we still have a destination. If we lose our way now, we will lose the meaning of our existence.
Xilonen: That's right. Natlan's heroes gave their lives so we could have this chance against the Abyss. Their sacrifices are our blessings.
Xilonen: Not only are their deeds and spirits exceptionally meaningful, they may also well be our path to victory. I don't want to give up just yet.
Paimon: Yeah! We're just one hero short!
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: The power from the device will allow me to remain awake for some time. I stand at the ready should you change your mind.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Even if you fail, you need only send someone my way. My offer still stands.
Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night: Humanity is truly remarkable. Even the gods in the heavens hold you to be special. Even now, you stand before me, dazzling like the sun.
Mavuika: You must have a profound connection to this land, since you're so determined to save it.
Mavuika: But, what are you really trying to protect? The land? Or its people?
"The Captain": ...
Paimon: #Pretty sure he wants to hear what you have to say, Traveler.
Traveler: I want to win.
"The Captain": Fine.
"The Captain": I suppose we can wait. Now that Ororon has inherited the memories of his forebear, there's only one hero left.
"The Captain": Your plan does have the potential to generate the best outcome.
"The Captain": In the meantime, you shall have the aid of all the Fatui under my command.
Mavuika: Thank you. Having such a powerful Harbinger on my side is a big advantage.
Mavuika: I know we may never completely see eye to eye on what it means to protect life, but for now, I'm willing to fight by your side.
Xilonen: Alright, we should let everyone else know about the plan. They're probably still at each other's throats outside.
Paimon: Good idea. We need to explain the situation.
Traveler: I have a few more questions for the Lord of the Night.
Paimon: Oh, guess we'll stick around then...
Ororon: I'll update everyone outside. Let's meet back up at the Stadium.
Traveler: What about you?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Kinich: ...
Solnev: ...
Paimon: Hey, don't get too close! Kinich is handling things over there!
