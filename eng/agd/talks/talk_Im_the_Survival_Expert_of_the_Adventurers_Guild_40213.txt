Lynn: I'm the Survival Expert of the Adventurers' Guild! Nice to meet you!
Lynn: I'm currently trying to complete the "Survive in the Wild" challenge. I don't even remember when I last set foot in Mondstadt...
Lynn: Actually, surviving in the wild isn't that hard, you just need to monitor your stamina, stay hydrated, and keep track of your temperature.
Lynn: Naturally, it's a bit lonely out there... So I appreciate our conversation.
