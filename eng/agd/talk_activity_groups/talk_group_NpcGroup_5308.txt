Rufina: Huh. I've never seen you around before. You're a new face and from outside, too! Normal humans don't come around here often... are you an adventurer, then?
Rufina: I've heard that they run around all over the place, just like you. Is that true?

## Talk

Traveler: I have been to lots of places, indeed.
Rufina: Ooh, that's great! I wanna join the Adventurers' Guild in the future, too. That way, I can explore all sorts of places!
Rufina: Alright. It's decided. I'm gonna be a great Melusine adventurer!

## Talk

Traveler: Yes, but for now, I must leave.
Rufina: Alright then. When you've got the time, tell me about the places you've seen, adventurer!

## Talk

Traveler: It'll be dangerous, you know.
Rufina: Yes, that's true. The books say that you'll encounter lots of crises.
Rufina: My big sister also tells me that "if you go out willy-nilly, you'll be gobbled up by a great big monster!" I know she's just trying to scare me, though.
Rufina: Hmph. Once I'm ready, and not afraid of any danger whatsoever, I'm going to explore the outside world!

## Talk

Traveler: Hurray for the Melusine adventurer!
Rufina: Hehe. That sounds awesome! Let me let you in on a secret — sometimes, I sneak out of the village to play!
Rufina: But only for a while. I always get back before my big sister can find out. Don't tell her, alright?

## Talk

Rufina: Ooh, it's you! I heard from my big sister about how you saved her. Hehe, you're super awesome!

## Talk

Traveler: I'd only call myself the normal kind of awesome...
Rufina: She said that you didn't just save her, but the bad guys even had to kneel and beg you for mercy... You're just like The Great Adventurer Stanley!
Rufina: I wanna be like him— No, I wanna be like you! I'm gonna be an awesome adventurer, too!

## Talk

Traveler: Thanks. Seeya!
Rufina: See you! Tell me about your adventures when you have the time, alright?

## Talk

Traveler: About the earthquake just a while ago...
Rufina: Did you hear that noise too? Something huge must have happened!
Rufina: Maybe some secret treasure was dug up or something — that's what happens in the stories I've read!
Rufina: Pity that my big sister won't let me leave the village whenever I want... If not, I'd have been the first one to discover that treasure. That would've been a fine start to my adventure!
