Qiuyue: Hmm, now that you mention it, I've heard that someone found some ores nearby that are of better quality than usual.
Qiuyue: That said, I'm just a businessperson, and I'm not in the mining business either. And it's not like I can leave my store so easily, anyway...
Qiuyue: I'd say that they saw it around... here. There, it should be marked on your map now. If you think it'll be of any use to you, feel free to take a look.
