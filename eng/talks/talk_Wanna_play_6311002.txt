Traveler: Wanna play?
Riku: Okay! Let's play Hide-and-Seek!
Riku: ...Ah, but my sister is still working at the shrine, and I promised her that I wouldn't run around. I need to wait for her so we can go home together...
Riku: If my sister can't find me, she'll probably worry...
Riku: Thank you, but I think I'll just play by myself.
