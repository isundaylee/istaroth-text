Traveler: About Stormterror...
Albert: Stormterror must have been moved by Barbara-sama's charisma, which returned it to its senses at last!
Albert: Barbara-sama's smile is like the dawn that breaks through the darkness. It is the star flashing through the night sky. Even Stormterror cannot withstand her loveliness!
Albert: If you cannot understand that, then you're part of the problem. You are not yet sufficiently enlightened!
Albert: Yes, this must be the truth! Go Barbara, Go!
