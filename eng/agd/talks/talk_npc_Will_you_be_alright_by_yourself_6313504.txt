Traveler: Will you be alright by yourself?
Mirai: Don't worry, I always go out and play, so I know the area around the village like the back of my hand.
Mirai: Even if I fall down, I've got Big Sis Reirei to help me.
Mirai: Big Sis Reirei's a doctor. She's a bit fierce, but she always helps me bandage the broken skin up, and she gives me some nice snacks, too!
Mirai: Of course, I know that I shouldn't run around all the time and trouble everyone. My brother said that good kids learn from their mistakes, after all!
