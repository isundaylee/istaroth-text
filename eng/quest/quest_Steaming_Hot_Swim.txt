# Steaming Hot Swim


## Talk 1

Pele Nui: Could you please come ashore, just for a bit? I need to clean up the springs over here.
Lazy Koholasaurus: Roar...
Pele Nui: Come on now, be a good boy! If not, I'm going to have to pick you up myself!
Lazy Koholasaurus: Roar!
Pele Nui: And he's gone in a flash, just like that. Ugh, how am I going to get a hold of him now...
Traveler: What are you up to?
Pele Nui: Hmm? You here for a hot spring bath? Sorry, but I'm in the middle of cleaning this pool here, so you might have to wait a moment.
Pele Nui: Also, this lunk won't come up and out no matter what I say. *sigh* And I've got so many more pools to clean, too.
Pele Nui: Could he be throwing a tantrum because I carried him out a few days earlier? Seriously, what a pain...

## Talk 2

Traveler: Maybe I can coax him out.
Pele Nui: Well... Yeah, sure, why not? Maybe a change of pace is just what the doctor ordered, eh? Good luck, then.
Pele Nui: Honestly, what's gotten into it? Before, I could just pat his <color=#00E1FFFF>head</color> or <color=#00E1FFFF>tummy</color>, and he'd just do what he was told...

## Talk 3

Lazy Koholasaurus: Hroo...? Rrroo, rroo...
Traveler: (Pat his head...)
Lazy Koholasaurus: Rroo? Oroo! Hroooo—
Lazy Koholasaurus: (The little Koholasaurus seems rather happy. He is sitting by the shore — you should be able to grab him and bring him up now...)
Black Screen Text: The little Koholasaurus finally quiets down. You carefully carry him up onto the shore...
Traveler: (Pat his tummy...)
Lazy Koholasaurus: Hrooh? Rroooo—
Lazy Koholasaurus: (The little Koholasaurus seems rather happy. He is sitting by the shore — you should be able to grab him and bring him up now...)
Traveler: (Try to just grab him straightaway...)
Lazy Koholasaurus: Raar! Oroo, rrooh!
Lazy Koholasaurus: (The little Koholasaurus seems quite unhappy, and he splashes water all over your face.)
Lazy Koholasaurus: (The little Koholasaurus watches you expectantly. Time to find a different way to cajole him...)

## Talk 4

Pele Nui: Well, you sure enjoyed yourself, huh? As for me, I need to go get changed...
Lazy Koholasaurus: Hroo! Rooh—
Traveler: You're all wet...
Pele Nui: *cough* He finally decided to listen — just needed to play with him for a bit, you know?
Pele Nui: You're done cleaning the spring over there? Thanks a lot, then. Here, take this as your reward.
Pele Nui: Once I'm done cleaning the others, I'll need a change of clothes... Wait, where'd that kid run off to?
Lazy Koholasaurus: Wrooh! Hroo—
Pele Nui: Hey, get back here! The springs over there haven't been cleaned yet!
Black Screen Text: The little Koholasaurus jumps joyously toward the other hot spring, with the shouting Pele Nui in hot pursuit...

## Talk 5

Pele Nui: Hmm? Why did he climb ashore by himself? Did he tire of playing?
Pele Nui: ...Well, whatever the case, thanks so much for your help. Here, take your payment. I'll go get him something nice to eat now...
Pele Nui: Huh? Where's he gone? H—He hasn't dived back into the hot springs again, has he?
Lazy Koholasaurus: Hroo! Rroooh—
Pele Nui: Hey, get back here! The springs over there haven't been cleaned yet!
Black Screen Text: The little Koholasaurus jumps joyously toward the other hot spring, with the shouting Pele Nui in hot pursuit...

## Talk 6

Lazy Koholasaurus: Phew... New friend... Hoo...
Traveler: (Pat his head...)
Lazy Koholasaurus: New friend! Hoo—
Lazy Koholasaurus: (The little Koholasaurus seems rather happy. He is sitting by the shore...)
Lazy Koholasaurus: Hoo, enough play. Rest...
Black Screen Text: The little Koholasaurus yawns and climbs ashore slowly...
Traveler: (Pat his tummy...)
Lazy Koholasaurus: New friend! Hoo—
Lazy Koholasaurus: (The little Koholasaurus seems rather happy. He is sitting by the shore...)
Traveler: (Try to just grab him straightaway...)
Lazy Koholasaurus: No! Wanna play! No go!
Lazy Koholasaurus: (The little Koholasaurus seems quite unhappy, and he splashes water all over your face.)
Lazy Koholasaurus: (The little Koholasaurus watches you expectantly. Time to find a different way to cajole him...)

## Talk 7

Traveler: I can help you clean the other springs.
Pele Nui: Would you really? That'd be great, because I'm pretty overwhelmed here.
Pele Nui: In that case, uh, just start from that one over there.
Pele Nui: I already scrubbed the bottom a few days back, so all you need to do is clear the junk floating on the surface.
Pele Nui: I'm counting on you, then. I'll continue persuading this little fella.
Pele Nui: *sigh* Honestly, what's gotten into him? Before, I could just pat his head or tummy, and he'd just do what he was told...

## Talk 8

Pele Nui: *sigh* Why's he throwing a tantrum like this...

## Talk 9

Pele Nui: Hahaha. Looks like the kid's fond of you. You convinced him to come along right away.
Pele Nui: Thanks so much. Here's your payment. I'll go get him something nice to eat now...
Pele Nui: Huh? Where's he gone? H—He hasn't dived back into the hot springs again, has he?
Lazy Koholasaurus: Rooo! Wroo—
Pele Nui: Hey, get back here! The springs over there haven't been cleaned yet!
Black Screen Text: The little Koholasaurus jumps joyously toward the other hot spring, with the shouting Pele Nui in hot pursuit...
