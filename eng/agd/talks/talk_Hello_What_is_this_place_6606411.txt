Traveler: Hello. What is this place?
Kahuna: This is the Obsidian Totem Pole. You might have seen ones like it in other tribes, but this one belongs to us, the People of the Springs.
Kahuna: After you complete tribal commissions, the Pole will grant you corresponding recompense â€” and you'll also have my thanks on behalf of our tribe.
Kahuna: As for anything else, go find Caramuru during the day shift! Can't be letting our primary appointment holder get off scot-free, you know?
