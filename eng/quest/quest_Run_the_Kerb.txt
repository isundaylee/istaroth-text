# Run the Kerb


## Talk 1

Traveler: I'd like to change party members.
Alfry: No problem! I'll call for partners for you now!

## Talk 2

Alfry: What are Adventure Reports?
Alfry: The Guild provides different recommended areas to explore based on your Adventure Rank.
Alfry: Which rank's Adventure Report would you like to see?
Alfry: Rank 1–5
Alfry: <color=#00E1FFFF>Windrise</color> is recommended for rookie adventurers.
Alfry: Go out of the front gates of Mondstadt, pass the bridge, and the steppe you come to would be <color=#00E1FFFF>Windrise</color>.
Alfry: Any other rank's Adventure Report you'd like to see?
Alfry: Rank 6–10
Alfry: Then, you might want to check out <color=#00E1FFFF>Starsnatch Cliff</color> or <color=#00E1FFFF>Springvale</color>.
Alfry: Which area you're more interested in?
Alfry: Starsnatch Cliff
Alfry: <color=#00E1FFFF>Starsnatch Cliff</color> is situated <color=#00E1FFFF>near the sea, east of Mondstadt</color>. It has quite a view.
Alfry: Where else would you like to go?
Alfry: Springvale
Alfry: <color=#00E1FFFF>Springvale</color> is located <color=#00E1FFFF>south of Mondstadt</color>. It's quite a close-to-nature village.
Alfry: When you reached <color=#00E1FFFF>Springvale</color>, follow the river upstream. There are many wondrous things on the highlands.
Alfry: I want to see the Adventure Report for another rank.
Alfry: Not now. Thanks.
Alfry: Oh, you don't need my help?
Alfry: Rank 11–15
Alfry: At that rank, you have a lot more choices. Which one are you more interested in?
Alfry: Stormbearer Mountains
Alfry: <color=#00E1FFFF>Northeast</color> of Mondstadt and <color=#00E1FFFF>North of Starfell Lake</color> is the <color=#00E1FFFF>Stormbearer Mountains</color>. What adventures await you?
Alfry: Where else are you interested in?
Alfry: Thousand Winds Temple
Alfry: You can find <color=#00E1FFFF>Thousand Winds Temple</color> near the sea <color=#00E1FFFF>south of Starsnatch Cliff</color> and <color=#00E1FFFF>north of Mondstadt</color>.
Alfry: Cape Oath
Alfry: <color=#00E1FFFF>Cape Oath</color> is located <color=#00E1FFFF>by the sea at the southeast end</color> of Mondstadt. It's said to be a favorite spot among couples.
Alfry: Wolvendom
Alfry: <color=#00E1FFFF>Wolvendom</color> is located at the <color=#00E1FFFF>west of the moat</color> of Mondstadt. The largest winery in Mondstadt, <color=#00E1FFFF>Dawn Winery</color>, is located <color=#00E1FFFF>south</color> of <color=#00E1FFFF>Wolvendom</color>. Go check it out if you have the time.
Alfry: Rank 16–20
Alfry: At this rank, your only choice would be <color=#00E1FFFF>Stormterror's Lair</color>.
Alfry: <color=#00E1FFFF>Stormterror's Lair</color> is just <color=#00E1FFFF>northwest</color> of here. An ancient ruin bigger than all of Mondstadt must have some mysteries to be solved.

## Talk 3

Traveler: I'd like to ask about something.
Alfry: Ask away. Helping Guild members is also our duty.
Traveler: Tell me about the Adventurers' Guild.
Alfry: Ad astra abyssosque!
Alfry: Roughly speaking, we are a hub for adventurous friends who resolve all kinds of troubles for the people or organizations.
Alfry: We need to put food on the table, of course. So there will be rewards for completing commissions.
Alfry: Katheryne at reception takes care of visitors.
Alfry: Since you're interested, please pay them a visit!
Traveler: Tell me about yourself.
Alfry: Me? I'm just an average person.
Alfry: Well... unless knowing everyone in Teyvat is something to talk about.
Alfry: It's not that incredible... The info came mostly from the resources of the Intelligence Department of Adventurers' Guild.
Alfry: I'm also a member of the Intelligence Department. Aside from contacting and guiding, gathering information is also part of my job.
Alfry: We've chatted for so long. I guess I can say we're friends now?
Alfry: Come on, tell me something about you!
Traveler: About the Intelligence Department...
Alfry: The Intelligence Department does not take part in commissions most of the time. We help adventurers to complete commissions by providing them with information.
Alfry: In simple terms, our functions can be divided into "collection" and "organization."
Alfry: Our field staff, known as investigators, handle the collection of information. An example is Fischl — she is an exceptional investigator.
Alfry: Others, like me, remain at the back-end and organize the information we have collected, before providing it to adventurers.
Alfry: So, the success of the adventurers is directly linked to the work of the Intelligence Department.
