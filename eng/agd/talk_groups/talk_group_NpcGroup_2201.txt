## Talk

Traveler: Are you a fisherman?
Jiangxue: No, you misunderstand. I don't fish for a living.
Jiangxue: Neither the process nor result of fishing means anything to me. But it does help to pass the time a little quicker.
Jiangxue: If you want fish, you can just have them.

## Talk

Jiangxue: The inn is straight up there. Oh, you want to chat? Keep your voice down then, don't scare the fish away.

Traveler: Who are you?
Jiangxue: I'm just a guy with a fishing rod and plenty of time on my hands.
Jiangxue: You really want to get on a first-name basis, huh? ...I stopped using my real name a long time ago.
Jiangxue: Just call me Jiangxue.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Jiangxue: Goodbye.

## Talk

Traveler: I want to go fishing too!
Jiangxue: You have far more important things to do.
Jiangxue: You don't want to follow in my footsteps. I'm just waiting around for my life to come to an end.
Jiangxue: Reason being, I did what I had to do, and now it's done.
Traveler: What did you have to do?
Jiangxue: I think you already know the answer to that. Because like you, I used to be one of the chosen ones in this world.
Jiangxue: The difference is, I used my power to do some bad things.
Jiangxue: I gave up my Vision. I'm not worthy of it anymore, nor do I have any real use for it.
