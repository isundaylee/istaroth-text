A crystal-clear snack. The regular, round balls sit upon the plate like coalesced flowing water, and their fillings glisten like pearls. During warm seasons, the very sight of this dish is a balm to the soul, and when it enters your mouth, the mild sweetness that flows out from within causes all your frustrations to vanish without a trace.
