Yiran: Manager Kuan! Thanks for the kite you bought me! Now, let's go fly it!
Manager Kuan: Firstly, for the umpteenth time, just call me "Daddy."
Manager Kuan: Also, since I bought that kite, could you call me "Daddy"?
Yiran: Well, if you're "Daddy," why don't you take me kite-flying?
Manager Kuan: This... Well, Daddy's been working, so he doesn't know how to fly kites.
Yiran: In that case, maybe you should learn, Manager Kuan!
Yiran: You always tell me to study hard, Manager Kuan, so now it's your turn!
Yiran: You've gotta set a good example, right, Daddy?
