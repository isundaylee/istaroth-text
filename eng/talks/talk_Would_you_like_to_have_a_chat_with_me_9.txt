# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Kaeya: You've come to the right person.
Kaeya: Speak your mind. I'm more than happy to keep you company.
Kaeya: Hmm... Though it's too bad we don't have anything to wet our whistles with...
Traveler: Why do you like to drink so much, Kaeya?
Kaeya: Well... largely because I like the taste.
Kaeya: But I can't deny that I also like how it makes me feel.
Traveler: I think I understand what you mean.
Kaeya: Oh really? Just from listening to me describe it? Despite having never tried it yourself?
Kaeya: That's quite a unique talent.
Kaeya: I have to say, though, that chatting with you is quite intoxicating...
Kaeya: Actually, in much the same way that drinking is.
Kaeya: So, I suppose... I'm just greedy and want to enjoy both of these pleasures at the same time.
Traveler: So all in all, I'm just another layer in your cocktail of pleasure?
Kaeya: Hahaha... What an interesting metaphor! I hadn't looked at it from that angle...
Kaeya: Let me think...
Kaeya: Hmm... Your analogy seems largely correct.
Kaeya: Save for one small detail â€” you, of course, are the main ingredient in said cocktail.
Traveler: So what you mean is, you drink to numb the pain?
Kaeya: Goodness, look at you, leaping to conclusions... Do I look like I've been through that much?
Kaeya: I'm quite content with my life right now.
