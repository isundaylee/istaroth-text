Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): People living on this island, please open your eyes and look around you!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): If the Ogosho is so mighty and invincible, why does she not face your questioning in person?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Why does she let our young people die for her and let us torment each other?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Look! Your Ogosho has been blinded. When has she cared about your predicament?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): We are the victims of the Vision Hunt Decree. We suffer the same frustrations in this chaotic world as you do!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Brothers and sisters, please join hands with us! Let us bravely make our voice heard by the Ogosho!
