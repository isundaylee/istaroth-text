Traveler: So, about Rex Lapis...
Hammer Li: What is there to be said? I was there at the Rite of Descension too. That scared the wits out of me...
Hammer Li: I honestly thought that it was over for us, that the sky was going to fall on our heads.
Hammer Li: But watching everyone go about their daily lives and have hope for the future anyway... I feel like I should reflect a little myself.
Hammer Li: If you look at things optimistically, Rex Lapis can't really have left us, wouldn't you say?
