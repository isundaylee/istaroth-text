# Delicious Bountiful Year

Luxurious and exquisite raw fish. The stacked raw fish is sliced as thin as cicada wings, and their taste is as light as mist, their pattern lines opal-white, like snow kissing the earth. One can hardly wait to dig in â€” the soft and smooth meat and myriad condiment flavors coalesce on the tongue, to the praise of all. Truly, this is the flavor experience to top them all!
