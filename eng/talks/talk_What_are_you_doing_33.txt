Traveler: What are you doing?
Fengyan: I am in charge of patrolling the area around Yiyan Temple. This is where we hold the Rite of Descension, so we must pay special attention to safety measures.
Fengyan: When I was young, I accompanied my father to take part in several Rites, in order to see Rex Lapis' true appearance.
Fengyan: The majesty and divinity of Rex Lapis at the rite made a deep impression on me, one that stayed with me my entire life â€” from my personality to the path I've chosen in life.
Fengyan: Ugh, look at me. One slip of the tongue, and I end up saying so much... If you see anything unusual, please feel free to let me know.
