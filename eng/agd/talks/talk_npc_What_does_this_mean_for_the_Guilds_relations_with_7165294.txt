Traveler: What does this mean for the Guild's relations with the Akademiya?
Yingzhu: Incidents like this are everyone's worst nightmare. It's damaging for the Guild's reputation, and it will affect our standing with the Akademiya...

Yingzhu: Traveler, please do make the matter of the Irminsul Fruit fragments and the Energy Amplifier your top priority.
