# Talk Dialog

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Let me see, dear guest. Ah, you have flown with Nachtraben Airlines several times now...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): We're currently doing a survey, in truth. Could I ask how you feel about the quality of service that we have provided so far?
Traveler: I think it's pretty great.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): To receive your acknowledge is a great honor indeed.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Alright, next question. How do you feel about the services of our flight attendants?
Traveler: You do a comprehensive job!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Wonderful. We are honored to have served you well.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Thank you for your answers. Your feedback is very important to us. Please, do enjoy your stay!
Traveler: I don't quite feel at home.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): I see. So we have not yet done all that we could...
Traveler: I gotta say I don't fly with you very often.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Hmm. Is this perhaps because our routes are insufficiently well planned?
