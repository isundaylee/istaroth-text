Akeor: I'm not sure how I did it, but hey, at least we've made a lot of progress, right?

Traveler: Do you mean...
Akeor: Ohh, I mean the wisdom of the ancients!
Akeor: I've dug up a lot of treasures ever since I partnered up with this young lady from Sumeru. We're finding more and more useful tools.
Akeor: Have you ever seen a storage device that can compress phlogiston with three times the usual efficiency? With it equipped, my Saurian can run as fast as the wind!
Akeor: We haven't yet figured out how it works, but man, it feels great to use. Miss Tahmures has said that we don't have to get to the bottom of everything — that sometimes, science will work just like magic.
Akeor: Still, at this rate, perhaps I'll even become strong enough to sign up for the Pilgrimage...
Akeor: Ah well, the contract still takes priority, so I'd better finish the tasks that Miss Tahmures gave me first.

Traveler: Congratulations.
Akeor: Haha, thank you, thank you... Even though I still have no idea what's going on, hehehe...

Akeor: Have you ever seen a storage device that can compress phlogiston with three times the usual efficiency? With it equipped, my Saurian runs as fast as the wind, making chasing after monsters and carrying materials an absolute walk in the park!

Akeor: Later, my Saurian and I even made several trips to the other tribes to deliver supplies, so we weren't around here as often... *sigh* This is all thanks to Miss Tahmures's help. I sure hope I'm not slowing her research down in any way.

Traveler: Good luck.
Akeor: Thank you. Thank you!
Akeor: I'd love to have found more useful treasure, but our present gains will fuel my research for a time.
Akeor: Ah, yes, Ms. Tahmures said that we shouldn't make too much of a fuss when the Akademiya folks show up, since we did leave early without authorization.
Akeor: Seems like research and tournaments both favor those who are prepared to start at any time.
