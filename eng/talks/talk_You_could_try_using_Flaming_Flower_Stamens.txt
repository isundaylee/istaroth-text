Traveler: You could try using Flaming Flower Stamens.
Paimon: Yeah, that's a good idea. The Flaming Flower Stamens are really hot and should be able to dry them out in no time.
Paimon: To be on the safe side, you can also put them in a large glass bottle, so you don't have to worry about fire spreading.
Mats: Good idea. I'll send someone to get the needed materials!
Mats: You two are very clever, and I am in your debt!
