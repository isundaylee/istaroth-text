Traveler: So what are you gonna eat while you're in Liyue?
Geri: Well, luckily my sister and I both know enough about cooking that we won't go hungry...
Geri: ...No, we can't let it come to that! We came on this trip to eat food from all around the world, and that's exactly what we're gonna do!
Geri: Yes, I must force myself to get used to the food here... Okay, full disclosure, we caved and cooked some pancakes this morning. Here, take them off me.
Geri: Come on, Geri, you can do this... One whole portion of chop suey, delicious chop suey...
