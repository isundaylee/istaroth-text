Huffman: Tell me about the Knights of Favonius.
Huffman: Since I don't want to take up your time touring Mondstadt, I'll make it short.
Huffman: The Knights of Favonius are the protectors of Mondstadt, the swords and shields of this city.
Huffman: ...So you'd like to know how we're doing lately?
Huffman: Thank you for your concern. Me and my outstanding colleagues are protecting our beloved people, as usual.
