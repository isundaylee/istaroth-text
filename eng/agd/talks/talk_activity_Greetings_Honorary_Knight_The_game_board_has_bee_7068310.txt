# Talk Dialog

Phonia: Greetings, Honorary Knight. The game board has been reset. You may begin your simulations at any time.
Traveler: Could you tell me who you were, one more time...?
Phonia: I'm Phonia. Presently the 7th Company's intelligence officer, and also the one who proposed this Wargame.
Phonia: But ultimately, I am just a "cog" in the "machine" that is the Knights of Favonius.
Traveler: How's the wargaming gone?
Phonia: Rather well. Thanks to you, we've already come up with standard combat procedures for most common monsters.
Phonia: If you're interested, you'll be able to find these procedures in our library once we're done putting them together.
Phonia: But with your immense strength, I doubt you would need these strategies, designed as they are for ordinary knights. Perhaps you might even "critique," rather than "check," them.
Phonia: In any case, until our analytic assignment ends, feel free to perform simulations as you please, as many times as you please.
Traveler: Well, I'll leave you to it then. See you.
Phonia: Then we'll talk more next time, Honorary Knight.
