# Unforeseen Circumstances


## Talk 1

Yasutake: Thank you for helping look into the situation with our deliveries.

## Talk 2

Takashi: ...You're asking me what I think Thoma could do better?
Takashi: He's busy enough as it is, don't you think? I barely see him around here at the Commission.
Takashi: And when I do, more often than not, he's busy with the housework.
Takashi: I think he should carry on doing what he's doing. Everyone's got their own way of living, and Thoma's no different.

## Talk 3

Sakai: You can't buy Noctilucous Jade anywhere these days, it's been a real headache...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Masanobu: Greetings, welcome to the Yashiro Commission.
Traveler: About Thoma...
Masanobu: People have been talking about him behind his back? Surely not.
Masanobu: He does a wonderful job and always remains modest about it. Why would anyone single him out?
Masanobu: Huh, I can't figure it out. Try asking someone else.

### Additional Talk 2

Thoma: So, have you had any ideas?
