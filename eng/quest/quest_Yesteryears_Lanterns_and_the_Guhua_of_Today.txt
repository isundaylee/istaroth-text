# Yesteryear's Lanterns and the Guhua of Today


## Talk 1

Sun Yu: Are you quite alright? How did you suddenly develop a headache... Do you need any medicine?
Little Que'er: No, uh, no need... Just stay with me for a bit, I'm sure it'll pass...

## Talk 2

Sun Yu: If I release a lantern around here, the adepti might see it, right? But with these materials...
Traveler: What are you doing?
Sun Yu: Ah, I'm sorry, my junior and I were just considering the matter of releasing a Xiao Lantern.
Sun Yu: The trouble is that we don't quite have sufficient materials on hand...
Sun Yu: But if you are willing, friend...
Little Que'er: There you go again... Guhua this, Guhua that...
Little Que'er: The Lantern Rite only comes once a year, and all you can think to make a wish about is the Guhua Clan...
Sun Yu: Are we not both disciples of Guhua? It falls to us to revive the Guhua Clan to its former glory.
Little Que'er: Yes, Brother... whatever you say, Brother...
Sun Yu: Excuse me, friend. Would you, perchance, be willing to fetch some Xiao Lantern materials for me?
Traveler: Sure.
Sun Yu: I salute you.
Sun Yu: Ahem. So, I've checked over everything. It seems like we're still missing a Qingxin...
Sun Yu: The last ones we picked have since dried out and turned brittle...
Traveler: You can make Xiao Lanterns from Qingxin?
Sun Yu: Heh, it's an unorthodox method that my fellow Guhua disciples and I once came up with when we were bored and had nothing else to do.
Sun Yu: But there is something rather nice about Xiao Lanterns scented with flowers.
Sun Yu: I shall await you here. Please bring the materials here once you have found them. You have my thanks.
Traveler: Your fellow disciple might have something to say about that...
Little Que'er: No, it was nothing! No, whatever he wants, that's fine by me...
Sun Yu: *sigh* Sister...

## Talk 3

Sun Yu: I shall await you here. Please bring the materials here once you have found them. You have my thanks.

## Talk 4

Sun Yu: Thank you! We should be able to make a Xiao Lantern now.
Sun Yu: It's done, Que'er. Inscribe our wishes on this lantern later, if you will, for your handwriting has always been very good...
Little Que'er: Sure, sure. I'll do the writing.
Sun Yu: Que'er... Are you... displeased, by any chance? What's the matter?
Little Que'er: Oh no, I'm not displeased at all. In fact, I couldn't be more happy to help release this lantern...
Traveler: *cough* Ahem! So, uh, where were you planning to release that lantern?
Sun Yu: Wh—Why, uh, yes! Indeed, friend, you speak the truth — we should do exactly that.
Little Que'er: Okay, you can go if you want. I won't join you, though. It's a hard climb and I don't have the energy.
Sun Yu: But... But we've been resting here for a sufficiently long time, I do believe...
Little Que'er: Uh, I've got a headache coming on. I don't know, maybe I caught a cold from this mountain air. It was a bit windy just now.
Sun Yu: I... Uh...
Traveler: ...Please, allow me.
Sun Yu: I... ...*sigh* If you would be so kind, my friend. In fact, I had originally planned to release it from a very specific location...
Sun Yu: Back when the Guhua Clan still... well, existed, an elder disciple would take me there to release a lantern every Lantern Rite.
Sun Yu: Sadly, the Clan has since met its demise. No practitioner of Guhua has set foot in that place to release a lantern in a long time...
Sun Yu: Since you offer your aid, my friend, I shall not refuse it. Please, go there and release this Xiao Lantern on my behalf.
Sun Yu: I shall mark the location for you. Meanwhile, I need to take care of my fellow disciple...
Traveler: I'll release the lantern for you!
Traveler: Ahem. You should go release your lantern.

## Talk 5

Zhiruo: You're here... to release lanterns?
Zhiruo: None but the members of the Guhua Clan know of this spot, and yet your faces are unfamiliar...
Traveler: I'm here at someone's behest.
Zhiruo: There are those of the Guhua Clan who still remember this place?
Zhiruo: I saw no one when I first arrived, and that saddened me, I must admit...
Zhiruo: But it gladdens my heart to know that there are still those of the Guhua Clan that remember this place.
Traveler: The Guhua Clan used to release lanterns here?
Zhiruo: Yes... We would craft our lanterns, then an older disciple would bring us here. They'd lead the way, and we'd follow behind with our lanterns in hand.
Zhiruo: Back then... Xiao Lanterns from all over the mountain would merge into one in the sky. It was a wonderful sight.
Zhiruo: But now...
Zhiruo: ...Let's release the lantern first. If you have the time, we can discuss the past further as we walk.

## Talk 6

Zhiruo: I remember that there was once when, on the occasion of our releasing lanterns, a high-spirited senior demanded a match with me.
Zhiruo: I had yet to make reply when a trusty female junior of ours stealthily poured water on the ground where he stood.
Zhiruo: With the ground so wet and slippery, our elder disciple had not even drawn his sword before taking one step, slipping and falling, and landing right on his buttocks. I laughed so hard that I promptly followed suit.
Zhiruo: He was not angry, he just pointed at me and laughed. Everyone else gathered around and laughed along...
Zhiruo: I don't know where he is today...

## Talk 7

Zhiruo: I also once saw a glimmer of hope. It was a young boy who had just joined the Guhua Clan. He was handsome, well-mannered, and exceptionally talented. It seemed like he would be the one to revive the tradition.
Zhiruo: But he was a difficult one to track down, and no one would see a glimpse of him for long periods... *sigh* I guess I never should have put my hopes in him.
Zhiruo: Better to let him go, and not hold out for his return.

## Talk 8

Zhiruo: When I left the Guhua Clan, there were barely any disciples left.
Zhiruo: Master did not blame me. He just told me to live a good life.
Zhiruo: But now, I don't know whether I have lived a good life...
Zhiruo: ...Or just... made it through life, with little to show for it.
Zhiruo: I've heard people say that a Guhua disciple called Sun Yu is currently visiting the mountain, and that he seeks to revive Guhua.
Zhiruo: If only I had his courage...
Zhiruo: Sorry, I'm prattling away, aren't I... It's good to come outside once in a while, get some fresh air, and get some things off my chest...
Traveler: You seem a little down.
Zhiruo: Oh... I'm fine. It's just... this time of year.
Zhiruo: Anyway, it's getting a little late. Happy Lantern Rite, and... please, could you pass on a message to the one who sent you with the lantern? The message is this:
Zhiruo: ...The message is... Um...
Zhiruo: ...Um, um... "Happy Lantern Rite, from Zhiruo," I suppose.
Traveler: Happy Lantern Rite to you, too.
Zhiruo: Thanks. Take care of yourself.

## Talk 9

Sun Yu: Ah, you're back. Did you release the Xiao Lantern?
Traveler: About what happened when we released the lantern...
Sun Yu: I see. Yes, Zhiruo... I remember her. She took good care of me back then.
Sun Yu: And she still remembers the Guhua Clan. I am pleased...
Traveler: How is Little Que'er?
Sun Yu: Ah yes, Little Que'er's headache is getting better. Perhaps she had just caught a cold, I'm now preparing to...
Little Que'er: Brother, about that person Zhiruo you were speaking of just now...
Little Que'er: Was she your senior in the Guhua Clan? Was she good-looking? Were you two close?
Sun Yu: Oh well, I can't say I knew her too well... But Zhiruo was quite adept at healing wounds. Whenever anyone was injured, we'd always go straight to her.
Sun Yu: Hahaha, now that I think about it, there were probably many that fancied her in the Guhua Clan.
Little Que'er: And how about you, Brother?
Sun Yu: Oh, uh... I...
Little Que'er: Brother, you and Zhiruo... what's your relationship, exactly?
Sun Yu: Uh... We aren't very close, really. You could say we share the fated fellowship of our clan...
Little Que'er: Oh... Then what about the relationship between you and me?
Sun Yu: Hahaha, why, we also share the fated fellowship of our clan, of course!
Little Que'er: ...
Sun Yu: Que'er? Is... is there something wrong?
