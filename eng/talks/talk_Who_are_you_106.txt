Traveler: Who are you?
Kazim: I watch over the White Lift. I'm also in charge of its maintenance and repair.
Kazim: This machine is very important to the village's water supply. Before it was built, we had to get our water one bucket at a time.
Kazim: Its critical importance is precisely why I am planning to secure its future while I still can.
Kazim: Fortunately, my son Kazan, unlike many other young people, has not left the village to become a mercenary or a traveling merchant. As such, I'm planning to pass everything I know onto him.
Kazim: That way, he can take over in case I become unable to work.
