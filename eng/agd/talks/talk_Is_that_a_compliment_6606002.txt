Traveler: Is that a compliment?
Haloa Nui: That's okay! We've got a big group already, so it won't be a problem for you to join us.
Haloa Nui: Have you already met anyone else from the Nui family? They're all my relatives!
Haloa Nui: If you haven't met any of them yet, that could only mean that you've only just got here, and haven't learned too much about our tribe's way of life.
Haloa Nui: If you need help with anything, just ask! One of us is bound to be able to help you.
