# Crispy Potato Shrimp Platter

An attractive-looking pre-meal snack. A spread made from potatoes and berries is placed onto crispy potato slices, and a whole shrimp is then added on top. The fragrant and full-bodied flavors serve to whet the appetite, while the addition of Mint adds a whole other dimension to the mix.
