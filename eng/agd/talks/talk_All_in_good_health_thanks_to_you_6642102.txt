Traveler: All in good health, thanks to you.
Harjo: Oho, such confidence! Then do you think you're in shape to take on one of Fontaine's meka?
Harjo: I used to hear tales about mechanical warriors from those in Natlan who had traveled to Fontaine. They sounded so fantastical that I didn't know what to believe.
Harjo: But excitement always overcame doubt. I had a feeling I'd make my way here one day to test my skills against them.
Harjo: And now, that day has come!
Harjo: I heard the strongest Gardemeks can be found in a place called the Fortress of Meropide. You've gotta find a way to get there and check them out, let me tell you.
