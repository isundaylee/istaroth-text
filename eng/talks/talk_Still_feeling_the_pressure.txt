Traveler: Still feeling the pressure?
Iaune: Well... yeah.
Iaune: I'm not ashamed to admit that. It just means that I'm "taking every problem too seriously"!
Iaune: That's what Roialte and Semaine always tell me, anyway.
Iaune: But I still don't believe that being serious is a bad thing. That's why I've expanded the document workload here by three times, I suppose.
Iaune: But don't worry too much about me. I'll do my best to finish my work. You go about your day too, alright?
