Traveler: Tell me about yourself...
Wayna: I am the chief of the Scions of the Canopy. You may call me Wayna.
Wayna: Some people like to call me "Uncle Wayna," but please don't follow their example. Seriously, I'm not that old.
Wayna: To me, "maturity" is more like a fashion style.
Wayna: All it means is that I have the most adventuring experience out of everyone in the tribe. It's got nothing to do with my real age. Understand?
