Asagiri: Thank you for taking pictures for me. Miss Moriko came by again the other day to check my progress.
Asagiri: Somehow everyone's started writing light novels lately.
Asagiri: I heard that new manuscripts kept coming in at Yae Publishing House and a few rising stars had emerged.
Asagiri: *sigh* I gotta match their spirit. I might make myself a bit more popular if I draw illustrations for a well-written novel.
