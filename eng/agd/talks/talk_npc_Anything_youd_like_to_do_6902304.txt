# Talk Dialog

Traveler: *Anything you'd like to do?*
Xiangling: I want to go adventuring with you!
Traveler: Again? Isn't that what we always do?
Xiangling: Mm-hmm! Sure is!
Xiangling: But even so, it's still the thing I wanna do most!
Xiangling: I want to go adventuring with you into the unknown, collect strange new ingredients from all over Teyvat, and invent new recipes for you to sample!
Xiangling: Ahh... the more I consider it, the more I think nothing could ever make me happier!
Traveler: (Happiness à la Xiangling is beautifully simple...)
Xiangling: Huh? You okay?
Xiangling: You seem very quiet... Y—You don't like the idea?
Xiangling: I won't add any strange seasonings... promise!
Xiangling: Um — what I mean is... I'll definitely get your opinion before acting on any eureka moments!
Xiangling: A—Also, I won't slow you down when we're out in the wilderness!
Xiangling: And if I encounter any serious enemies, I promise I won't cause any trouble. First sign of danger, I'll run as fast as I can...
Traveler: I never said I didn't like the idea...
Xiangling: Phew! ...You scared the heck out of me.
Xiangling: ...Awesome!
Xiangling: A—Anyway, I'll make sure to keep working on my cooking... a—and any other skills that might come in handy!
Xiangling: Anything to put a smile on your face!
Traveler: What you said got me thinking, that's all.
Xiangling: Ohhhh...
Traveler: I thought you'd want me to sample one of your creations.
Xiangling: Taste-testing is all part of the adventure!
