# Memory's Final Chapter


## Talk 1

Khayyam: "The pomegranate sings, the apples clap..."
Paimon: Hello, Mr. Khayyam! What are you doing here?
Khayyam: Oh, hello, hello. Child in white, and... *sigh* Apologies, my children. My memories are getting blurry, and names just fade after a while...
Traveler: #Just call me {NICKNAME}.
Khayyam: Haha... Okay, so you were the...
Paimon: Yes! We were the Javans - the brave young ones!
Khayyam: Hmm... So, please tell me, do the Aranara still remember me? Do they remember us all?
Paimon: Oh, uh...
Traveler: They remember.
Paimon: ...
Khayyam: I see... But I can't see them anymore, nor can I know how much they miss me... What a pity.
Khayyam: Hehe... I can't see them anymore. I am too old to see their faces or hear their voices... Gone, it's all gone.
Khayyam: *cough*... Apologies, I have to take my leave now. Perhaps a miracle is my only hope...
Khayyam: One cannot understand or chase after a miracle. The only thing one can do is wait.
Black Screen Text: Khayyam unsteadily walks away...
Traveler: They forgot.
Paimon: But... We can befriend them all over again!

## Talk 2

Aranakin: #Aranaga, {M#he}{F#she}'s here, they're here!
Aragaru: Yeah, here, they're here!
Aranaga: #Here you are, Nara {NICKNAME}, White Floaty. Welcome you, the three of us.
Aranaga: Here comes the moon. Now, is the time to plant flowers. Are you ready?
Traveler: I am ready.
Paimon: Paimon too!
Aranaga: So... Aranakin, Aragaru, let's start the ritual.
Aranaga: "Be back home, be back home, dreams of the garden, memories of the forest..."
Aranakin: "Embrace, let us:"
Aranakin: "Deeper dreams, everlasting happiness."
Aragaru: "Rejoice, let us:"
Aragaru: "The pomegranate sings, the apples clap!"
Black Screen Text: The Aranara plant the dried flowers. With the ballad echoing in the wind, the flowers come back to life magically...
Paimon: Wow... The three flowers are alive again!
Aranaga: Yes, because benevolent, Mawtiyima is. So, she gives memories a chance to resurrect.
Aranakin: Yeah! Even if we forget about you, the memories will... Hmm, be woven into the leaf veins and roots, turn into leaves, turn into tree rings!
Aragaru: Or turn into fatty worms, eaten by other worms. Other worms make things that nourish the plants, and make us grow!
Paimon: But... You still can't recall anything about us, right?
Aranaga: Yes... Because, memories don't belong to you and me... The stories from the past, we have shared with all grass and trees in the forest...
Traveler: ...
Aranakin: But it doesn't matter, because we are new friends now, right?
Aragaru: Yeah! New friends!
