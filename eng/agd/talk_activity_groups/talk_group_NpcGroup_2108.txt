Hulu: Welcome! Care for a bottle or two of Liyue's finest local brew?

## Talk

Traveler: What's it like?
Hulu: It looks like liquid amber, and has just a hint of sweetness when it first hits the tongue...
Hulu: ...Followed shortly by a wonderful mellow aftertaste that lingers long after the fact. You won't find one better!
Hulu: And because we buy direct from Dawn Winery, we pass the savings right on to you...
Traveler: Dawn Winery?
Hulu: What about it? ...Oops, did I...
Hulu: I—I don't think I... I definitely said this is a local Liyue wine...
Hulu: You said it alright, clear as day.
Hulu: ...I can tell from the look in your eyes that I am faced with an expert...
Hulu: Okay, I'll admit it. We buy from the Dawn Winery and change the labels.
Hulu: It's not like I want to lie, but the Dawn Winery's wines are second to none...
Traveler: Not interested, thanks.
Hulu: N—Not interested? Come on, it's not every day you travel to Liyue, surely? Don't go home empty-handed...

Traveler: No thanks, bye.
