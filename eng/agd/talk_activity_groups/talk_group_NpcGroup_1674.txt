## Talk

Joserf: Hello there, we meet again. I remember you.

## Talk

Traveler: How have you been doing lately?
Joserf: I've been fine, thanks for your concern. That said, my memory is still somewhat foggy. I wonder when it'll all come back to me...
Joserf: Joel's been trying very hard to help me recover those memories. When I look at him, I just think that there's more I could be doing as well.

## Talk

Traveler: He's happy just having you back.
Joserf: That's true, that's true. And I'd be happy accompanying him to do anything, so long as it makes him happy.
Joserf: I agreed to go build a fox snowman with him. I'm not sure why, but it gives me this warm and familiar feeling...
Joserf: Still, Dragonspine is a very dangerous place. I'll make sure to keep an eye on Joel while we're here...

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Joserf: Take care, and thanks again for your help!
