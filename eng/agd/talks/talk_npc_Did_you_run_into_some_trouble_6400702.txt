Traveler: Did you run into some trouble?
Housein: No, no. It was just a thought.
Housein: I used to be a sailor. I've seen every kind of storm you could imagine, and not even a shipwreck could get the better of me.
Housein: The way I see it, gales and tidal waves are nothing compared to always trying to keep steady in life.
Housein: I guess what I'm trying to say is, planting a seed is easy, but raising that little sapling into a mighty tree is where the real work lies...
Housein: But don't let my brother Hassan hear that, or he'll start lecturing me again for being ungrateful, haha.
