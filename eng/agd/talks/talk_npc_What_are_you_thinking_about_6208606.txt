Nadia: What are you thinking about?
Nadia: I was just going back and forth in my mind a bit about what I should write in this letter.
Nadia: Usually I write to my family back home, but recently I've gained a penpal.
Nadia: Tell me about your penpal.
Nadia: He's also a guard here at the Northland Bank, but he's on duty during the day, while I'm on duty at night. To tell you the truth, I don't even know his name.
Nadia: One time, I accidentally left the letter I had written to my brother at our post.
Nadia: And then perhaps the other guard mistook it as a letter that I left for him. He even wrote me a reply.
Nadia: I could read between the lines and tell that he was probably very lonely, so I thought it would be good to go along with it to help him in this way.
Nadia: But eventually, writing to him also became a part of my life. I've even started looking forward to receiving his letters, hehe.
