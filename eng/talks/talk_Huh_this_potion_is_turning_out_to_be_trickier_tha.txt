Paimon: Huh, this potion is turning out to be trickier than Paimon thought it would be...
Diona: Well, making a potion that has the power to topple the wine industry is sure to be complicated â€” more complicated than mixing drinks, at least.
Diona: You know what? I'm gonna take a look around the area to collect some more materials.
Venti: Ah, if you're looking for high-quality materials, I know just where to go!
Diona: #Perfect! Lead the way... {NICKNAME}, Paimon, we'll see you later!
Venti: Bye! See you soon!
