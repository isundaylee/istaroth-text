Lepine-Pauline: You're back. So, did you find anything?

## Talk

Traveler: Give her the samples.
Lepine-Pauline: Excellent! Show me what you've got. Looks like "Graph Adversarial Technology" research is going to take another giant leap forward!

Traveler: About your research...
Lepine-Pauline: Oh! You're really interested in my academic theories?
Lepine-Pauline: If you want to learn the essential elements of my theories, I'll be happy to share them with you!
Lepine-Pauline: However, I don't really have any core reference materials or papers for my theory yet, since I just don't have the time to sit down and write any papers. My reference materials are also a bit scattered.
Lepine-Pauline: After all, I was so busy dealing with all sorts of outsourcing requests from the Fontaine Research Institute, that I simply didn't have the time to do any formal academic writing.
Lepine-Pauline: I recently pieced together the importance of the "Graph Adversarial Technology" discipline from various bits of literature, and then immediately began this project, and didn't even consider creating introductory materials.
Lepine-Pauline: "Graph Adversarial Technology" is a very difficult academic discipline with a high barrier to entry. If you're absolutely sure you want to study it, I will certainly share all of my knowledge with you, and hold absolutely nothing back, not even the slightest detail!
Lepine-Pauline: Of course, only if we can finish the task at hand first, hahahahaha!

Traveler: About the "Phantom Blubberbeast"...
Lepine-Pauline: Huh? Are you also curious about the details of their crimes?
Lepine-Pauline: In order to get the first samples for my "Graph Adversarial Technology," I interviewed numerous shops, and none of their owners have even heard of such a thing.
Lepine-Pauline: Even the author of the report hadn't the foggiest notion, it was as though they had completely absconded from Fontaine...
Lepine-Pauline: I think either that the "Phantom Blubberbeast" criminal base is extremely well hidden and kept very secret...
Lepine-Pauline: Or the Maison Gardiennage has ordered the shopowners to keep their mouths shut, and none of them are willing to reveal anything to outsiders.
Lepine-Pauline: Either way, this proves that the danger posed by the "Phantom Blubberbeast" is quite grave, and thus proves there is a huge market for my "Graph Adversarial Technology"! This is an incredible business opportunity!

Traveler: Goodbye for now...
Lepine-Pauline: Good luck! If you collect good samples, remember not to make me wait too long for them!

Traveler: Give her the samples.
