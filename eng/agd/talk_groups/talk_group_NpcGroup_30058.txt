Jean: The ocean really is beautiful at night...
Traveler: Do you want to chat?
Jean: Sure! What would you like to talk about, Traveler?
Traveler: How's work these days with the Knights...
Jean: Work? As long as Lisa's there, I'm not worried. She's more hardworking than anyone once she gets going.
Jean: Still, I put a lot on her plate this time. I do feel a little guilty...
Jean: Hmm, I must send her a gift. It's a good thing that I know what she likes.
Traveler: Tell me about these islands...
Jean: I've never visited an archipelago like this before. It certainly is a place like no other. It has something of the unknown about it, and seems to have its fair share of dangers... and yet the mystery is all part of its beauty.
Jean: It has a charm that I can't quite put my finger on. I think I'm slowly beginning to understand what drives adventurers to go in search of unknown places.
Jean: Traveler, you're an adventurer... do you understand what I mean?
Jean: Of course, safety still comes first when adventuring.
Traveler: Tell me about yourself...
Jean: You know... I think I've come to realize that I'm lacking a certain... fun side?
Jean: Sorry, I don't know exactly how to put it... Traveler, I want to ask you something.
Traveler: Sure.
Jean: Do you think that I'm... too serious?
Jean: I guess that's why everyone wants me to get more rest and relaxation... Apologies.
Traveler: No, no, that's what makes Jean so sweet.
Jean: Huh? Iâ€”I never thought that anyone would consider my personality as "sweet"...
Jean: Thank you for your constant kind words and comfort, Traveler.
Jean: Whatever the case, I think I know what everyone is getting at. I'll do my best to improve.
Traveler: About what happened today...
Jean: I honestly never thought that all of us would end up here...
Jean: I don't know if this is right, but... I think it's made Klee very happy.
Jean: She likes having fun and being around people. She can take care of the excitement, and I'll take care of everyone's safety.
Jean: What a beautiful view. The ocean is good company... I hope we can all find some peace and happiness while we're here.
Traveler: I won't disturb you.
Jean: Alright, good night.

Jean: I had no idea that any of this could have been Alice's creation.
Jean: Now that I know the truth... there is a certain sweetness to the scenery all around us.
Jean: Such a beautiful summer... what could be a better gift?
Jean: Oh! Speaking of which... I still have a promise to keep to Klee. Those fish won't blast themselves.
Jean: Traveler, would you like to take part in a bit of innocent recreation?
