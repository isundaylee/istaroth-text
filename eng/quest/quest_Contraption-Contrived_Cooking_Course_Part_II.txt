# Contraption-Contrived Cooking Course: Part II


## Talk 1

Cloud Retainer: One wonders if this device may make desserts also...
Traveler: What are you making this time?
Cloud Retainer: Impeccable timing, Traveler. One just finished ruminating on the making of this next dish — a "pudding," so it is named.
Cloud Retainer: Much consultation did one have with the most recent and popular recipes before deciding on this dish. It is said to be soft and tasty — a fine dessert indeed.
Cloud Retainer: Changes and improvements, too, has one made to it...
Cloud Retainer: ...Along with the addition of rice.
Cloud Retainer: Naturally, one's entitlement it is to name this new dish. Mmm... "Rice Pudding" shall its name be.
Traveler: Sounds really filling...
Cloud Retainer: The quality of the rice is key to this dish. Upon one's activation of the Supreme Cuisine Machine, order it one did to search for high-quality rice. The resulting search led one here.
Cloud Retainer: Well now, Traveler. Since you are presently here, will you help one collect some rice of fine stock? The Machine indicates that it may be found not far from here.
Traveler: Why is it me again...
Cloud Retainer: This device needs tending, and one cannot be in two places at once.
Cloud Retainer: Skilled you are in mind and hand, and are thus an invaluable helper. Go forth to one's aid, and one promises that you shall have a share in the Rice Pudding also.
Cloud Retainer: Well then, one presumes upon your aid.
Cloud Retainer: Supreme Cuisine Machine... activate!
Cloud Retainer: Traveler, one has now activated the machine. Follow the tracks it has created and retrieve the Rice that one desires.
Traveler: Can't you fly...

## Talk 2

Brunn: Thank you! You saved my life... I'm Brunn, a merchant.
Brunn: *sigh* Just my luck. I was originally transporting a batch of cargo...
Brunn: But... I never expected to get attacked by monsters while I was on my way.
Brunn: I just kept running, I didn't have time to worry about the goods, or to tell which way I was going... Eventually, I ended up here.
Brunn: After I got here, I thought I had completely shaken them off. That's why I wanted to get out of the cart and check the goods.
Brunn: But they suddenly came out of nowhere... Thank goodness for your help.
Traveler: What kind of goods are you transporting?
Brunn: I'm transporting a batch of ingredients, rice and stuff like that...
Paimon: Looks like this is the rice that the adeptus wanted us to find, but it doesn't look like there's much left...
Traveler: Could you sell me some rice?
Brunn: You want to buy rice? It's not that I don't want to sell it, it's just that...I basically lost all the goods in my cart on the road when I was running away.
Brunn: Those monsters must have brought the goods as loot back to their camp.
Brunn: What a headache. How can I get those goods back? If I can't get them back, I will lose a lot of money...
Brunn: Traveler... I see that you are very skilled. Can you help me get those goods back?
Brunn: I—If you are willing to help me, I will give you as much rice as you want!
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Brunn: Thank you! I'm counting on you then!
Brunn: Bring my transport balloon along and place the goods on it.
Brunn: I'll leave it to you, Traveler. I'll be waiting for you here. After you get the goods, please bring them back to me.
Traveler: I don't think I can carry so many goods...
Brunn: Don't worry, I have a solution.

## Talk 3

Brunn: Did you bring the goods back? Thank you so much, Traveler!
Brunn: You wanted... rice, right? Please wait a moment, I will pick rice of better quality for you...
Brunn: There! This rice is for you, it should be enough.
Brunn: Thank you, Traveler. I should be on my way now.
Brunn: I hope I don't meet any more monsters...

## Talk 4

Cloud Retainer: Traveler, have you secured the requisite Rice?

## Talk 5

Cloud Retainer: One could not call the heat control desirable...
Cloud Retainer: But no matter. One has ingredients to spare with which to attempt this once more.

## Talk 6

Cloud Retainer: Indeed, this is most fine. Just the quality that one needs.
Cloud Retainer: Since the ingredients are readied, one shall now activate the machine.
Cloud Retainer: As before, in your hands shall one leave the heat control, Traveler.
Cloud Retainer: One would have you report your readiness once you are sufficiently prepared.

## Talk 7

Brunn: I'll leave it to you, Traveler. I'll be waiting for you here. After you get the goods, please bring them back to me.

## Talk 8

Cloud Retainer: Are you fully prepared, Traveler?

## Talk 9

Cloud Retainer: One shall entrust the heat control to you, Traveler.

## Talk 10

Cloud Retainer: Mm, a lovely flavor indeed. No less would one expect of oneself, or one's own Supreme Cuisine Machine. Haha!
Traveler: Let's not get all high-strung here...
Cloud Retainer: Your hand in this matter was mighty also, Traveler. Come. Prepared one has your recipe, as promised.
Cloud Retainer: What then shall one cook next? Hmm...
Traveler: How can this machine seemingly do everything...
Cloud Retainer: Cunning one's hands are, and no less should be expected of one's hand-crafted masterwork. Hardly a cause for alarm, one would say.

## Talk 11

Paimon: These should be the goods we're looking for. Wow, that's a lot of stuff...
Paimon: Good thing we've got that transport balloon with us, huh? Come on, let's move this cargo back.

## Talk 12

Traveler: I'm ready.
Cloud Retainer: Then let us begin.
Cloud Retainer: Supreme Cuisine Machine... activate!

## Talk 13

Cloud Retainer: Well then. Is the Rice Pudding complete?

## Talk 14

Traveler: I'm not ready yet.
Cloud Retainer: Hmm. Ready yourself, then, and inform one once it is so.

## Talk 15

Cloud Retainer: Now then, Traveler, pursue the scent one has put you on and retrieve the requisite Rice.
