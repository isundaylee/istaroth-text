# Gold Devouring and Mora Gathering


## Talk 1

Hatim: Traveler! Ah, I mean, wondrous child of fortune and luck! You're here!
Hatim: I ate the "Golden Dish" you prepared the last time and made a killing on the Exchange!
Hatim: I came here today to check and sure enough, I have made great gains on all the futures I bought!
Hatim: Come, let's go to Lambad's Tavern, and you can order whatever you want. It'll be my treat! I must thank you, after all.

## Talk 2

Hatim: I went to the "Wealth Spot" and even ate the "Golden Dish"...
Hatim: But the result is this drop...! This makes no sense! How is this market making any sense? Where's the fairness!?
Paimon: Hatim, we've been looking for you for a long time. Are you okay?
Hatim: Ah, it's you guys... I... I'm fine. I'm great... Look. I'm not missing an arm or a leg or anything.
Hatim: I just lost my deposit... Ahem...
Traveler: S—Sorry...
Hatim: No! This is not your fault. Don't take it to heart.
Hatim: Of course, it's certainly not my fault either. What's truly to blame is this market for being bad.
Hatim: It makes no sense! It doesn't follow rules! It just goes down like that, and goes up like... like... Well, it didn't go up...
Hatim: Really, argh... I really...
Hatim: Never mind, I simply cannot believe it... I cannot believe that I, Hatim the exceptionally rich from Kalimi, still cannot conquer futures trading!
Traveler: Didn't you lose everything...?
Hatim: Hmph, it doesn't matter. I still have plenty of backup funds.
Hatim: Even if I don't have any Mora on hand, I still have working capital and assets elsewhere.
Hatim: Just you wait, Kalimi Exchange! I, Hatim, shall be back!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Hatim: This is all thanks to your help, so please, order whatever you'd like to eat today! Haha!
Paimon: Looks like you really did make a lot of Mora!
Hatim: It is a good sum by a normal person's measure, but compared to the assets that I, Hatim, possess, it is but a mere ripple.
Hatim: After all, I am also privy to knowledge obtained from decades of experience as an old hand. If you are interested in futures, I can share some of my personal experiences with you, in fact.
Hatim: We agreed the last time that you shall gain additional benefits, so please, ask me anything.
Paimon: Heh. Y'know, this additional benefit doesn't feel all that different from not having any!
Traveler: We don't play with futures after all...
Hatim: Oh, nonsense! You shall have a share of the Mora too, of course. But compared to that, my advice is what is truly of value!
Paimon: Then Paimon has a question... Will there really be slime futures?
Paimon: N—Not that Paimon wants to profit, of course! Just asking...
Hatim: Only commodities in circulation can become futures, so if there is as much Slime Condensate as flour and milk on the market, then it's possible for tradable Slime Condensate futures to be created.
Hatim: But I've mentioned this before. If you want to trade in Slime Condensate futures, I'm afraid that all Slimes in the wild will go extinct.
Hatim: Plus, institutions or individuals who specialize in raising slimes may arise, and they may continuously produce large quantities of Slime Condensate.
Hatim: When that time comes, the price of Slime Condensate might also go up...
Paimon: What!? It's just buying some Slime Condensate, how can things get so complicated...?
Paimon: #P—Paimon'll just stick to getting {NICKNAME} to beat those Slimes up...
Hatim: What about you, Child of Fortune? Do you have any questions?
Traveler: How did you come up with the idea of "Golden Dish"?
Hatim: Ha! You really are a Child of Fortune. Straight to asking about the key to wealth.
Hatim: I can't really say that I "came up with" it, but I can say that I learned about these "Golden Dishes" during my long career in futures trading.
Hatim: The futures trading market is treacherous... But as long as I have my "Golden Dishes," piloting this investment ship shall be a cinch!
Traveler: This really is nonsense...
Hatim: Ah, enough of that! Come, eat, eat! Eat up! I'll be asking for your help more often in the future.
Hatim: Here! Try this Shawarma Wrap. It's Sumeru's special dish. You really must try it, hahaha...
Black Screen Text: You enjoy the delicious food with Hatim...
Traveler: Isn't this just what they call "peace of mind"...?
