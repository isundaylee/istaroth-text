Kuki Shinobu: I took a part-time job selling toys once. Barely managed to sell anything, and I got tons of complaints from the parents...
Kuki Shinobu: Allegedly, my face mask and generally mean-looking demeanor was frightening the kids... It's funny, because I distinctly remember hearing the kids say how cool I looked as they walked by.
Kuki Shinobu: Whatever. It's in the past now, anyway.
