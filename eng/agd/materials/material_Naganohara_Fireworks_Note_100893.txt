# Naganohara Fireworks Note

A note that Yoimiya gave you to record firework formulae with. If you give this note to Yoimiya, she will be able to make fireworks just as you remember them.
No matter how time passes, or people and things change, so long as you take care of this note, you will stand guard over a door to the past. Perhaps you too will find happiness that belongs only to you under a firework-filled sky.
