# Firstborn Firesprite

A tiny lifeform that emerged from a flame within a shell.
There is something quite endearing about its over-reliance on the shell it found protecting it at the moment it gained its sentience â€” perhaps it feels secure in this closed-up world. After all, when its eggshell is completely enclosed, it reigns supreme in its own little universe.
It is said that in ancient times, the Primal Fire burned with a similar life force.
