Sido: We meet again, friend of the General Mahamatra and the Flame-Mane. It's a shame that we can't stick around and chat for a few more days â€” we're preparing to return to Sumeru.
Traveler: How did the Wargames go?
Sido: The longer we spent doing it, the more we felt we learned.
Sido: For instance, we found ourselves facing monsters from Inazuma the likes of which we've rarely seen. Even with all our years of experience as mercenaries behind us, there was very little that could help us find an effective way to defeat them.
Sido: In the end, it was only after seeing the offensive strategies being used by others that we suddenly realized what we needed to do. It was like a revelation!
Sido: It must be said though, when you pit simulated monsters against one another like this, as long as you analyze the scenarios carefully enough...
Sido: There's always a way to ensure victory, even for a very averagely-equipped squad of Eremite mercenaries!
Traveler: Well then, see you in Sumeru!
Sido: Hahaha, yes! Next time we meet, I'll invite my brothers, the Flame-Mane, and even the General Mahamatra if possible, and we'll have a proper get-together!
