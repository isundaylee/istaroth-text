Traveler: A letter?
Lutz: We can deliver letters to almost anyone in Fontaine, as long as you have the Coupons to pay for postage. Though we're practically doing it as charity, if I do say so myself.
Lutz: So would you like to send a letter? If so, please pay for postage first. And also, no queue jumping.
