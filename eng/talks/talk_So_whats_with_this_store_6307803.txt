Traveler: So, what's with this store?
Ryouko: This food stall... was founded by my husband, who asked me to join him.
Ryouko: I didn't really want to work in this line of business at first. You have to wake up early and go home late. My husband was never in good health either... How could he have handled this for long?
Ryouko: But he told me that he loved seeing the smile on people's faces while they were eating the snacks I made... In the end, I could not dissuade him.
