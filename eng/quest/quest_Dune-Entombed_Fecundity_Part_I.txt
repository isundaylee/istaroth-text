# Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part I


## Talk 1

Jeht: #Hey... It's just ahead, right? Look out, {NICKNAME}, and don't let the sand get in your mouth.
Azariq: Haha. I think you're the one who needs to worry about that! Keeping your mouth shut works better than anything in stopping that from happening!
Jeht: Mind your own business!

## Talk 2

Babel: #You've arrived, {NICKNAME}. I hope that our hospitality hasn't disappointed you.
Babel: Ah, Jeht. While you're here, I shall entrust the great task of apprehending the traitor Aderfi to you...
Babel: I suspect that the recent spike in traitors within the tribe has something to do with the interference of those who hail from the snowlands.
Jeht: You mean the Fatui?
Traveler: The Fatui... Their influence spreads even here?
Paimon: They're just like those... toads or centipedes Liloupar keeps talking about... We keep running into them everywhere we go!
Babel: Initially, they approached our merchants under the banner of trade. Then, before long, they started meddling in our affairs... Annoying as it is, the forces behind them are indeed powerful.
Babel: Prior to the present, we had already pushed the northerners out of our territory, forbidding them from appearing on our hunting grounds to prevent them from further harming our people.
Babel: Yet, they continue to circle us in the desert like hyenas. I don't know if they seek treasure or an alliance from us... Regardless, they are dangerous.
Jeht: I got it. I'll return with additional information or a newly claimed life.
Babel: "And."
Babel: Information, and a newly claimed life.
Azariq: ...
Jeht: ...I understand.
Babel: Ahem... However, the Fatui are not the most important segment of today's conversation.
Babel: #{NICKNAME}, the task I bade of you today... I believe that Azariq has already gone over the broad strokes with you.
Azariq: Indeed, Matriarch Babel.
Babel: Good, but I must warn you still that the path ahead is fraught with dangers... Our scouts have discovered signs that many Wenut may be active in the area.
Azariq: #Be at ease, I will guide {M#them}{F#them} down a safe path.
Traveler: About the Wenut...
Babel: Wenut are extremely dangerous creatures. Approach them with caution. They may attack you upon being drawn by the Jinni's presence.
Liloupar: Speak not of me as if I am some manner of calamity, desert-wench!
Liloupar: My master, I will be alert on your behalf. If you come under assault by these Wenut... I may yet be able to rally my strength and defend you.
Jeht: #I've got your back too, {NICKNAME}.
Paimon: Whoa! Suddenly, we've got two handy sidekicks. Hehe.
Babel: Esteemed Liloupar... After entering the foundations of the Eternal Oasis, we must rely on your power to guide the group.
Babel: The ruins of the canals may yet hide your... fragments.
Liloupar: Indeed. Of this I am aware... But I am curious as to how this knowledge came unto you.
Liloupar: You learned this from "outsiders," did you not?
Babel: ...
Azariq: ...
Liloupar: Ha! Worry not! Robbing a few bookish researchers, parting a merchant camp with the maps they have brought with them... These are tricks of an old trade for a desert-dweller! I understand! Ahahaha!
Liloupar: Thank you for granting me this boon of knowledge. It shall yet lead me to old memories and power both. But I will be watching you, and that lad of yours.
Jeht: Liloupar, what's wrong with you? Matriarch Babel only organized this expedition to ensure that I can lay my parents to rest! How can you just... slander her like this?
Babel: Jeht!
Babel: My apologies, esteemed Liloupar. I understand your misgivings, and will endeavor to win your trust...
Liloupar: Do as you will. I seek respite!
Jeht: ...
Babel: Ahem. Very well. Do not let me forestall your departure. Leave as soon as you are able.
Traveler: About Azariq...
Azariq: I'll be your guide and help to expel the Wenut, but I won't be heading into the forbidden zone. Sorry.
Babel: I respect Azariq's considerations. The remains left by a god long past... That is something not lightly disturbed by the likes of us, who yearn only to stand vigil over this tomb. This most unpalatable task must fall to you.
Jeht: Thanks for this opportunity, Matriarch Babel.
Babel: Yes... I hope for your safe return.

## Talk 3

Jeht: #What? There are still more camps ahead? Hold on for a second, {NICKNAME}. I'm going to check.

## Talk 4

Jeht: There are so many scattered ruins here... I wonder what happened.
Liloupar: If my memories had never come so undone, perhaps I could offer you enlightenment.
Liloupar: But all that unfolded here, all that has not been regarded as a "lesson" by the sages of other nations... It hurts my very being.
Jeht: Can Jinn feel pain too?
Liloupar: The Jinn have little need for a vessel, and even less need for senses. But should we begin to connect with others... Then we will take from them their pain... Even should we not comprehend the source of it.
Jeht: Oh...
Liloupar: I know my words are beyond your understanding. There is no need for you to placate me.
Jeht: I did understand you! Just... Not completely...

## Talk 5

Jeht: There's a mechanism there. Let's go check it out!

## Talk 6

Jeht: ...
Traveler: Found something?
Jeht: Look there. Those tunnels. I'm thinking... of connecting them and clearing the accumulated sand. I think that might open a path for us.
Liloupar: Ah, a reckless thought, born of ignorance. Still, the plan is worth a try.
Jeht: You're getting on my nerves, Jinni.
Liloupar: It is my acknowledgment you are receiving, little one.
Jeht: Aren't you the little one here!?
Paimon: Jeht's young and Liloupar's small, so the way Paimon sees it, they're both little ones.
Jeht: By that logic, seeing that you're both young and small, that makes you the littlest one!
Paimon: #What? D—Don't bring Paimon into your squabbles! {NICKNAME}! Paimon's not little, right?
Traveler: ...
Liloupar: Hah... How adorable...
Traveler: What are you thinking about?

## Talk 7

Liloupar: The path ahead lies beneath the sands.
Jeht: What... Oh, it's been buried... It'll take years for just us few to dig it out.
Liloupar: Fret not. Let us hunt about for mechanisms nearby that might help drain the sand.
Paimon: Sure! Let's go!

## Talk 8

Black Screen Text: As the shard of light merges with Liloupar's magic bottle, you feel a little of your own power being pulled away...
Black Screen Text: Through the Jinni's entranced eyes, you see a ragged shepherd boy along with a dancing maiden, her presence resplendent like a limpid gem beneath the moon's gaze...
Festering hatred assails your senses, before alchemizing into primal, burning love in a sudden instant...
Such love cannot be contained by the vessel of a mortal. It is an emotion that can swallow one whole.
Black Screen Text: "Then, mortal... What desire of yours can I make manifest?"
Jeht: #{NICKNAME}! Are you alright? Answer me!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}! Don't scare Paimon like that! Are you okay?
Liloupar: Worry not... my master remains unscathed.
Traveler: Sorry, I was out of it for a moment...
Jeht: #{M#"Out of it?" I thought you lost consciousness!}{F#Really? I thought you were seized by something foul within the bottle!}
Paimon: Yeah! You worried Paimon sick!
Liloupar: Apologies. I did not mean to let you behold a moment so shameful. But as you might understand, I have reclaimed a portion of my memories. Now, I may guard you better.
Paimon: Huh. The light inside the bottle really does look more sprightly now.
Jeht: Yeah... It looks just like the lights I saw when Matriarch Babel was emerging from Azariq's tent.
Paimon: ?
Jeht: ...Let's change subjects.
Liloupar: Across the sands, there is still much of me that lies scattered. If you find it within yourself to offer me this generosity, my master, I will be beyond grateful should you collect my fragments and return me to wholeness.
Liloupar: In areas around a Jinni's fragments, a spot of green should flourish...
Liloupar: This is because we Jinn always release energy around us to create an environment conducive to our slumber. I hope you shall bear this in mind.
Traveler: I will.
Liloupar: You have my thanks.
Paimon: Paimon will help too! Paimon's eyesight is second to none! Don't worry about it.
Liloupar: Ah... I am invigorated! Come. Let us delve deeper.
Jeht: Yeah. Let's go.
Traveler: It was a memory. Someone else's memory...
Jeht: Huh? I don't... What are you saying?

## Talk 9

Paimon: Whoa... What a cavern. Was this place full of water too?
Jeht: What is this place?
Liloupar: A mechanism once built to sustain a dream of eternity, to supply the oasis, forever and always. It was once propelled by water but is now driven only by sand.
Liloupar: King Deshret left his glass goblet here, at the center of this place. The tales speak of him bidding farewell to joy, and leaving his cup behind here as a receptacle to contain past traumas and memories...
Liloupar: And those traumas and memories protected the eternal sleep of my mistress, the Lord of Flowers.
Jeht: Was that... something that happened in your time?
Liloupar: Hm? I suppose, but the details elude my recollection, what with my memories being as scattered as they are...
Jeht: Then, we need to go down there and activate that... glass?
Liloupar: Patience. See how there are still two points of entry? Perhaps there are more mechanisms that we need to disable.
Liloupar: Prithee have faith in my intuition, dear master.
Paimon: Huh... So, how are we going to get through now?
Jeht: Hmm... Looks like all we can do is head back to the surface and find another path. Uh... Jinni, can you find another way leading to the other two tunnel entrances?
Liloupar: I dare not claim to be certain. With loose confidence... I believe so.
Jeht: Alright. Good. Then, we'd best get back to the surface and start plotting a new path. Any objections?
Liloupar: What do you think, my master?
Traveler: (Return to the surface) Let's go back first.
Paimon: Alright...
Traveler: I need to look around some more.
Liloupar: Your words, my will, my master.

## Talk 10

Jeht: #{M#What? Did you find anything new? Heh, care to share?}{F#You know, I actually look forward to exploring together like this, and that's something I haven't felt in while, let me tell you... And there's something new there too.}
Traveler: (Return to the surface) Let's go.
Jeht: We're going, then. Keep up.
Traveler: I need to stay and explore.
Jeht: Alright. Be careful. I'll wait for you here.

## Talk 11

Liloupar: My lord, I already see it! It's a fragment of mine, of my divinity and wisdom. Please... Please bring me closer!

## Talk 12

Jeht: Hmm. You got any plans after this? You wanna come with us?
Azariq: Come with you? You've found a path?
Liloupar: ...Don't tell...
Jeht: Of course!
Liloupar: ...
Azariq: Heh, never mind that for now. The sky's dimming. We should rest. The path will still be there tomorrow.
Jeht: Ha. You're right about that!
Jeht: Speaking of which... Liloupar, I'm curious but never got to ask...
Jeht: Why do you hate Matriarch Babel so much?
Paimon: #Yeah. Other than {NICKNAME}, you've been mean to everyone... Especially Matriarch Babel. Every word you say is always so harsh...
Liloupar: What of it? Does it displease you that I taunt your "tribe-mother" so?
Jeht: Of course it does! But I want to know why...
Liloupar: Hmm... Why, you ask?
Liloupar: Ha... Let me tell you a story, child.
Black Screen Text: The cold of the desert nights bears a heft to its chill, and murmurs of secrets whisper over the midnight dunes basked beneath the silvery fang of a crescent moon...
With a low voice, the Jinni breathes life into a tale from an age long past...
Black Screen Text: Once, a Jinni and a mortal king found themselves entwined in love, and from their union came children...
Black Screen Text: But as time flowed, the mortal could not break the chains of power and ambition that clung to him, betraying the love of the Jinni...
Hence, on the path of revenge, she twisted the fates of her children, wreathing them in a plot to unmake their father and kingdom...
Black Screen Text: And time sailed ever onward...
The children of the Jinni grew to become king and queen, yet fell to the same schemes, to the same curse... Until their kingdom was finally shattered upon reaching calamity's end.
Such an ending, then, was that which the Jinni had orchestrated from the very beginning...
Jeht: So... That was a scary story... horrifying, even. But what does this have to do with my question?
Liloupar: The Jinni in the story is not so unlike Babel, is she?
Liloupar: Where they differ, however, is the shame and quests for renown that so compel your kind... Babel wears them like a mask, though she too is a creature of deceit. I taste it wafting from her very being.
Liloupar: To her, be it son or daughter, all children are but instruments for her schemes.
Liloupar: If you were absent, my master... I fear I might even be quite fond of her. But today, things are different... She threatens your safety, and so affability is beyond my sphere of virtues.
Jeht: No, Matriarch Babel isn't that kind of person...
Liloupar: You have spent more time with her, and must've taken orders from her. Orders that... "the left hand" must never learn of.
Liloupar: Perhaps those sordid affairs were just too inconvenient for you to face or consider... But I know your follies, and stupidity does not rank amongst them. Consider these matters yourself.
Azariq: It's fine, Jeht! Don't take this stuff so seriously. It's not like she's that much nicer to me or anything!
Liloupar: And should I? To you, who are little more than a slave?
Liloupar: My words have run dry... Apologies, then, if I have upset you.
Jeht: ...
Paimon: Umm... Maybe we just haven't been together that long? Liloupar was pretty mean to Jeht before, but she seems much nicer now.
Paimon: So, uh... Maybe... If everyone knew more about each other, we could have a few less misunderstandings... and stuff like that?
Azariq: Yeah... Let's talk about something else instead.
Jeht: S—Sure...
Azariq: What's the matter, Jeht? You're looking real distracted right now.
Jeht: Nothing... Just continue...
Azariq: Speaking of which, what have you all discovered? Tell me — I'm curious.
Jeht: Well... I don't really know how to describe it to you. There are countless ancient pipes leading into the temple inside the mountain and... the legendary goblet of Al-Ahmar is there too.
Azariq: ...So, that thing was more than just a legend, huh? It really exists...
Paimon: What are you talking about? Is that goblet valuable or something?
Liloupar: Hah. That's not the actual goblet. It's just a mechanism holding the Eternal Oasis in stasis.
Paimon: Aghhh... So, it's worth nothing at all? Now Paimon's depressed.
Jeht: Yeah... So, that's what we've seen so far.
Azariq: Then, the Eternal Oasis... was never far from us at all.
Jeht: Yeah... Dad always told me that he would one day enter the Eternal Oasis and find Mom again... Never thought I'd be helping him make his dream come true.
Traveler: Jebrael would be proud of you.
Jeht: Him? Ha! I don't care about him! Dad was a real simpleton... This trip was for me to send him to the place where he belongs. It doesn't matter what he feels about this!
Jeht: ...
Jeht: Ah... I don't know. Truth be told, I just don't know...
Jeht: My parents... Will they truly reunite in such a place? The place we're heading to... Is it just a meaningless destination that I want to reach for the sake of... because I want to console myself?
Paimon: No way! Jebrael would be super happy! You're helping him fulfill his wish after all...
Jeht: #Whatever the case, I have you to thank, {NICKNAME} and Paimon. Thanks for... coming all this way to accompany me on this adventure. And, y'know, putting up with my... willfulness.
Jeht: #{M#Ever since I lost Dad... I only feel this free when I'm with you.}{F#After Dad... left, the fear of losing my home only leaves me when I'm with you.}
Paimon: Hehe, being able to adventure with you again has been great for us, too!
Azariq: *cough* And what about me, eh? Cold and alone... Abandoned by the fire...
Jeht: Hahaha! Stop it! You're my family too! You really showed me how things were done when I first came to the tribe.
Azariq: Hmph! This little wildcat was terrifying when she first arrived, let me tell you. Her face was like a doll. She wouldn't cry, wouldn't talk... But after spending some time messing about with me, she slowly opened up.
Paimon: Whoa. So Jeht has moments of silence too? Paimon never thought that was possible!
Jeht: #Stop your heckling, Paimon. Don't listen to him. You too, {NICKNAME}!
Azariq: Hahaha! Indeed. She didn't complain when she fell... and she didn't cry when she was hurt. Her calmness was... frankly terrifying, but her rage... When it comes... "Crash!" She's like thunder.
Jeht: What are you saying? Do you want a beating?
Azariq: Anyway, though Jeht is young, she is far more mature than most her age. It's frankly a relief.
Jeht: Alright, alright. You're full of it... *sigh* I practically died of embarrassment when I first joined the Tanit...
Jeht: The time after Dad was gone... was like a haze. Anyway, I thought I would never be able to feel normally again.
Jeht: It was all thanks to Azariq guiding me, teaching me how things worked in the tribe like a big brother that I could recover. It's been slow going...
Azariq: That's how it was. No need to be modest!
Jeht: Yeah. Dad also said he was going to tell me more stories about Mom. But now, I'm never going to get a chance to learn who she was.
Jeht: He said she was a beauty, that she was a character with countless virtues, like... "O stars high above the wasteland..."
Azariq: ...
Jeht: "O stars high above the wasteland, O nightingales weary from the day. It's time to take off the crown of roses; Cleanse yourself with wine made from grapes."
Jeht: That's the only memory I have left of her. Dad always used to sing me this old nursery rhyme.
Azariq: That was lovely.
Jeht: Stop it, you know I'm always out of tune!
Traveler: You sing it better than Jebrael did.
Jeht: Hah. I knew you'd remember. I spent a long time practicing this one. Couldn't get it down when Dad was still with us.
Jeht: After Dad... left, I, uh... Heh. Finding my pitch just got that much harder. But I still learned pretty good, didn't I?
Paimon: Yeah, that sounded good! Jeht's voice might be a little raspy, but it fits a soft melody like this.
Traveler: Hmm. Just like Jebrael.
Jeht: ...Yeah.
Jeht: Alright, you should get some rest. We have lots to do tomorrow. I'll stand watch tonight.
Black Screen Text: "Sleep, close your eyes;
The eternal oasis welcomes the lonely wanderer,
Lay upon the pure and flowing streams;
For here, memories are forever sweet and pure."
Traveler: This is the song Jebrael liked to sing...
Traveler: I imagine you're looking forward to this too, Jeht.
Jeht: Of course, and that's because I'm with you guys!
Jeht: Dad once said that the sands are like our home. I didn't get it at the time, but now I think I'm beginning to understand...
Jeht: Home isn't perfect. Sometimes, it's downright frustrating, domineering, or even cruel. But you know you belong there.
Jeht: You'll treasure its atmosphere and fear that it might leave you. You'll do anything to stop anyone from trying to tear it apart and seek care and companionship from its existence.
Jeht: It took leaving Dad's protection to learn that this is what "home" is.
Jeht: I know that Dad would never abandon me and that he never lied. But people have to grow up and find new homes for themselves.
Jeht: To me, the Tanit might just be that home.
Paimon: Finding a new place to belong to is great, and Paimon's sure Jebrael would be happy for you! Yep!

## Talk 13

Azariq: Hey, the sun's up. Got something to show you. Follow me!
Jeht: What's the hurry? And what's with the secrecy? Can't you just show us here?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Jeht: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, how'd you sleep?
Traveler: Not bad. Thanks for asking.
Paimon: Ah... Why did Liloupar have to use all those strange metaphors about bugs and scorpions? Took Paimon half a night to get them out of her head!
Azariq: Haha... Glad you guys got some rest. I sure didn't.
Jeht: Huh? And who asked you to get up in the middle of the night to go find Matriarch Babel?
Azariq: Hmph. Wrong way around. She came to find me.
Traveler: What did Matriarch Babel want from you?
Jeht: Ah... It was an urgent... thing.
Azariq: Some matters concerning the... elders of the tribe, you know?
Liloupar: Oh... I see we have happened upon some open secret.
Traveler: ...
Paimon: ?
Azariq: Matriarch Babel spoke briefly with me last night. What we must do next is use the tunnels in the dunes to enter the underground portions of the Eternal Oasis.
Liloupar: Indeed... My Master, Al-Ahmar, once created a most intricate system of canals, shaped to provide irrigation for the soil of the mortal kingdoms...
Liloupar: Before the dune was encased in sandstorms, before Al-Ahmar was naught but dust, this place rolled with hills most fecund and verdant.
Azariq: But those canals have long run dry. Fortunately, that lends them to our purposes quite well, allowing entry to the foundations of the Oasis within the dunes.
Jeht: So Matriarch Babel has finally made her decision.
Azariq: #It's because {NICKNAME} reclaimed the Jinni. She can serve as our guide. Moreover, my tongue's as clever as that of a mockingbird's, but you should know that by now.
Liloupar: I indeed witnessed this occurrence, my master, but I thought there was little need to go into detail about it with you.
Jeht: ...
Jeht: Alright. Let's go and discuss the rest of the details with Matriarch Babel, then.

### Additional Talk 2

Black Screen Text: The night flies by amidst the card games and chats.
As the next morning comes, you are buried in each others' pillows, asleep by the extinguished flame.
