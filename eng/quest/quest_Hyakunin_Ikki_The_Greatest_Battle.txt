# Hyakunin Ikki: The Greatest Battle


## Talk 1

Kayabuki Ikkei: Why hello there, outlander! Do you have any interest in a little scrap, by any chance?
Traveler: I've been in thousands of those.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Ah, wonderful! Glad I had my eye on the right person.
Kayabuki Ikkei: It's like this: recently, some people have organized a Hyakunin Ikki in secret again.
Traveler: Don't you mean the Hyakunin Isshu?
Kayabuki Ikkei: No, no, I said "Hyakunin Ikki." What on earth's the "Hyakunin Isshu," anyway...
Kayabuki Ikkei: This practice used to circulate amongst the Tengu-Kin, who imitated the tengu. Basically, they would do this—
Kayabuki Ikkei: When the situation went ill, when they felt down, when something worth celebrating occurred, or if they were simply bored...
Kayabuki Ikkei: They would engage in a hearty fight to celebrate, or simply to eliminate bad luck.
Traveler: Sounds like you could just hold it at any time...
Kayabuki Ikkei: ...Now that you mention it, that is true, yes.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Whatever the case, let's find another place to discuss this matter. There are too many people in the city for such talk...
Traveler: I'm all ears.
Traveler: Do you have a commission for me?
Kayabuki Ikkei: Now, I wouldn't call this a commission...

## Talk 2

Kayabuki Ikkei: Here we are.
Kayabuki Ikkei: You can enter the Hyakunin Ikki Dojo by stepping through this... rather suspicious door.
Traveler: Oh, that's pretty exciting.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Though the Tengu-Kin have long been banned for flouting public order and morals, some still hold the Hyakunin Ikki free-for-all tournament from time to time.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Monsters, adventurers, and warriors who long for battle will be attracted here to engage in passionate battle on this stage.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Feel free to bring your friends and companions! After all, the "Hyakunin" in "Hyakunin Ikki" means the more, the merrier!
Kayabuki Ikkei: You seem like a well-traveled adventurer. You shouldn't lack for any companions to take part together with you.
Traveler: You're not taking part?
Kayabuki Ikkei: Oh, of course I will — as a spectator, cheering you on!
Kayabuki Ikkei: In truth, my goal here is to write the most epic fighting novel ever and use it to take first prize in Yae Publishing House's "This Novel Is Amazing!" contest...
Kayabuki Ikkei: ...And my gut tells me that your star will shine brightest in this arena.
Traveler: I'll do my best.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Great! In fact, I already have a name for my novel. I'm calling it "Hyakunin Ikki: Greatest Battle Chapter." If you should see it in Yae Publishing House's store one day, look out for the bit where the blond-haired outlander makes their debut!
Kayabuki Ikkei: I'm looking forward to your performance.
Traveler: Of course.
Traveler: Oh, that's suspicious alright.
