# Talk Dialog

Traveler: (Tell about an ordinary experience.)
Goncourt: Hmm, that's a good story. But to make it work on stage... I think the story would be almost unrecognizable.
Goncourt: Personally, I like that kind of story. Ordinary events can tell us a lot about a person's character... Some might disagree, of course, but that doesn't matter.
Goncourt: Perhaps the most important thing is that audiences expect conflict and twists! And, unfortunately, this probably does not meet those expectations. Such a shame.
