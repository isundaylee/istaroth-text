## Talk 1

Orban: Guess this wasn't a waste of time — my head's back in the game.

## Talk 2

Orban: I think this match has given me some inspiration for my forge-work... Thank you.

## Talk 3

Traveler: Materials?
Orban: I've tried forging weapons from all kinds of materials. But each and every one of them has turned out to be completely unexceptional.
Orban: This has led me to understand the limitations of ordinary ores...
Orban: Take this polearm with you. It's just a test piece that I forged once upon a time — but for the average person, it should make a fine weapon.

## Talk 4

Orban: What is it?

Traveler: What do you make of this tooth?
Orban: A tooth? Ugh, don't tell me you've been foraging around on the mountain for junk...
Orban: ...Huh, although, as teeth go...
Traveler: What? What is it?
Orban: This is a rather fine specimen. Tough as nails, too...
Orban: And these contours... Looks an awful lot like Dragontooth to me.
Traveler: What do you mean, "Dragontooth"?
Orban: As in, the tooth of a dragon. Weapons made from Dragontooth are supposed to be extraordinarily strong and sharp... and even possess some sort of strange power.
Orban: It's hardly the sort of thing you come across every day, though... In all the stories you hear, it's only ever the most famous heroes who manage to acquire Dragontooth and craft weapons from it.
Orban: As they say, if you plan on slaying the dragon to pinch his teeth... you'd better be sure to have a dragon-slayer of a weapon handy, or he might just bite back!
Traveler: Then... is this really a dragon's tooth, or not?
Orban: Honestly, I've never dealt with Dragontooth firsthand, so I can't give a definite answer.
Orban: I do think it has to be the tooth of some enormous beast or other...
Orban: Anyway, since you've gone to all this effort... let's just treat it as if it really is a genuine, precious piece of Dragontooth, shall we?
Orban: Hmm, but that said — it's not enough to make a weapon from.
Orban: How about you go find, say, three more pieces of Dragontooth, and in the meantime, I'll do some reading and find out how to work with this stuff.
Orban: Oh — and *Dragontooth* aside, we'll want to supplement it with some good ore...
Orban: In which case, while you're up on the mountain, grab 50 pieces of *Starsilver*.
Orban: Ah yes, and as well as all that... I'm also going to need a *Northlander Polearm Billet*...
Orban: Once you've got all of that, come and see me again.

Traveler: I found some more Dragontooth...
Orban: Ah, I was hoping you'd swing by. Listen, before you go gathering all that Dragontooth... Oh. I see you've already finished.
Orban: My profuse apologies... but I've hit a slight snag. No matter what I hit this thing with, I simply cannot take so much as a sliver off of it.
Orban: It's almost as if it really were Dragontooth... If so, then based on what I read, there are several rather specific methods to work with this material.
Orban: One of them is to have the dragon's tooth absorb some sort of... dragon-related "vitality."
Orban: Then, use the dragon's tooth infused with dragon vitality to work the other pieces of Dragontooth into shape.
Orban: But how to go about infusing something with dragon vitality... I haven't the foggiest idea.
Orban: Any thoughts, Traveler?
Traveler: I'll, um... see what I can do.
Orban: Great! Here — you take this Dragontooth, then, and I'll leave that whole side of things to you.
Orban: Huh, if just the teeth cause this much hassle, whole dragons must be seriously complicated creatures...

### Talk 4 related talk 2

Traveler: I'm here about the Dragontooth again...
Orban: My goodness, the luster... and the texture...
Orban: You actually managed it? You infused the tooth with dragon vitality? Wow... You are one extraordinary individual, my friend.
Orban: This is great... I've already got someone to handle the Starsilver. Give me a moment or two, I will get this weapon made right away...

Orban: There! It's done! Haha! Here, hold that. How does it feel?
Traveler: How much do I owe you?
Orban: Oh, don't worry about paying for it. The chance to work with these materials was a rare pleasure, no need to bring Mora into it.
Orban: Alright. I'd say this weapon is ready for an adventure, wouldn't you? I hope you'll take good care of it.

### Talk 4 related talk 4

Traveler: Take a look at these dragon teeth...
Orban: Wow, these are incredible... Are these genuine Dragontooth?
Orban: If so... That would be truly amazing.

### Talk 4 related talk 5

Orban: Thoughts on this Dragontooth?
Orban: I can't say whether it really is Dragontooth or not, but the quality is superb. A few more like this, supplemented with some Starsilver, and you could definitely make a good weapon from it.
Orban: As soon as you've gathered all that, bring the goods straight back here.

Traveler: Who are you?
Orban: My name is unimportant, only my work is.
Orban: Have you heard of the weapon named Cool Steel? It's the sword of the adventurer Herman, who was once famed throughout the continent. I forged it for him.
Orban: ...Though a number of people praised it quite highly, it was one of my more ordinary forging projects.
Orban: For me, the most important weapon is the next one I'm making...
Orban: That one alone deserves to be remembered as part of my legacy.

### Talk 4 related talk 8

Traveler: Why are you here?
Orban: For a weapon. One that is destined to be remembered by all who hear its name.
Orban: You can make as many mundane weapons as you like, and they would all be meaningless. That's the life of a blacksmith, not that of a weaponsmith.
Orban: A true forgemaster needs only to build one famous weapon.
Orban: I will use my life's worth of skill and sweat to forge that weapon. Once it is complete, all Teyvat will remember it — and me.
Orban: It is for that reason that I am here on this mountain — for it contains the materials that I have been searching for all this time.
