# Talk Dialog

Traveler: How do you do...
"Mural Maniac": Oh, a new face.
"Mural Maniac": Welcome to the Graffiti Alliance HQ... It might just look like a normal house, but still!
"Mural Maniac": If you're looking for one or more of our members, I regret to inform you that a couple hundred of them are busy painting all over Natlan, while others are busy managing their lives.
"Mural Maniac": They only visit HQ to pay membership fees, or when seeking out technical assistance.
"Mural Maniac": Anyone from Natlan you see holding a spray can and paint bucket is probably one of ours.
"Mural Maniac": If you want to visit, feel free to do so any time.
"Mural Maniac": But you won't find any of our alliance members' exquisite masterpieces here â€” those are scattered all over Natlan.
