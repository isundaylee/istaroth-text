Yae Miko: The novels here actually aren't all that bad. But a little fried tofu and a few drinks would make things better still...
Yae Miko: So, little one, do you think you could pull a few strings and get your hands on some for me? Without them... I don't think I'll be able to muster the energy to help you explore this domain...
Yae Miko: Hahaha, oh, the look on your face, so dumbfounded... I'm joking, can't you tell? Do you really believe the great Lady Guuji herself would be so fickle?

Yae Miko: Dear me, is it time to go off and fight again already? All this running around is getting quite exasperating...
Yae Miko: I have half a mind to transform into a kitsune and hitch a ride on your shoulder... Hehehe, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Yae Miko: In your dreams. Oh, little one... you've still got a long way to go before Yae Miko, the wise and beautiful, permits you to see her true form.

Yae Miko: Do you think we'd ever see Ei in the outside world again if there were this many stories to read in her Plane of Euthymia? ...I, for one, rather doubt it.
Yae Miko: Hmm, I have an idea. Let's tell her that we know a wonderful little domain full of light novels and Tricolor Dango. It's high time she got out of Tenshukaku for a bit.
Yae Miko: Ah yes, and Dango Milk too. ...Hmm? They don't have it here? Well, don't look at me, little one, that's your job. Sort it out. Where there's a will, there's a way.
