Traveler: You're closing for good?
Qingbai: That's right. Last day today. Business hasn't been great, haha...
Qingbai: But don't mind me. If you concern yourself with anything, it should be these low prices! No prices lower than clearance prices.
Qingbai: On the fence? Take it home tonight and see how it looks with the other decor â€” if you like it, come and see me again tomorrow...
