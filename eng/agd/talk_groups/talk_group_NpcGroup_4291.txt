Babel: Apologies, our business has me distracted... Was there something you needed?
Traveler: About the traitors...
Babel: Ah, we have let an outsider see the troubles our traitors have caused us... How shameful.
Babel: But worry not. With Jeht's aid, Aderfi will soon be delivered unto rightful justice.
Traveler: Is Aderfi truly a traitor?
Babel: He has already stained the Tanit name... This means that he has cast aside the name of his mother, and must be punished.
Babel: As with nations or cities, tribes too must enforce their laws. I think you understand this.
Traveler: I'm just concerned that there isn't enough evidence...
Babel: Well... You are of the city-folk. It is unsurprising that you worry about matters such as "evidence" and "suspicions." This I understand.
Babel: But for us Tanit, he has already stained the name of the tribe with his dishonor... Forgotten the name of his mother. Punishment must be delivered unto him.
Traveler: About Jeht...
Babel: Jeht? She is a good child. She learns our ways quickly and greets trouble with neither grimace nor complaints.
Babel: Heh. Speaking of her, it's a shame that there was an... incident between us and her father in years prior...
Babel: But I'm just glad that Jeht has returned to us. Though her father... *sigh* I suppose we can consider this a delayed resolution.
Babel: She likes you, you know. I can tell.
Babel: So... Please don't disappoint her and ruin the friendship you have.
Traveler: About Azariq...
Babel: He is my "son." Though not born of my flesh, I trust him very much.
Babel: Clever, loyal, strong, ethically unbending, and skilled in gaining favor with others. Like a loyal wolf to the pack, he has never failed me.
Babel: It is a shame that he is... male.
Babel: If he was a woman, he could take my place... That way, I could finally retire and lead the children in managing our Sumpter Beast caravans.
Babel: Heh... But at least I still have Jeht.
Traveler: See you.
Babel: Farewell. I bid you safe travels for your coming adventures.

## Talk 1

Babel: Apologies, our business has me distracted... Was there something you needed?
Traveler: About the traitors...
Babel: You speak of Aderfi and Azariq, yes? Their actions have shamed the Tanit, and before a guest no less...
Babel: They spent too long in contact with those northerners, and forgot that they were children of the Tanit, bound to the rules of the tribe.
Babel: Thankfully, I still have Jeht... She has lived up to my expectations and more.
Traveler: About Jeht...
Babel: Jeht? She is a good child. She learns our ways quickly and greets trouble with neither grimace nor complaints.
Babel: Heh. Speaking of her, it's a shame that there was an... incident between us and her father in years prior...
Babel: But I'm just glad that Jeht has returned to us. Though her father... *sigh* I suppose we can consider this a delayed resolution.
Babel: She likes you, you know. I can tell.
Babel: So... Please don't disappoint her and ruin the friendship you have.
Traveler: About Liloupar...
Babel: Naturally, she has her own perspective. That which provoked her rancor was a misunderstanding regarding our actions...
Babel: But if we wish to rejuvenate the desert, the lands need to be fertile, that they may offer an easier life for our people. Hence, we must rely on Liloupar's favor.
Babel: We hope to come to a mutual understanding on this point at least...
Traveler: See you.
Babel: Farewell. I bid you safe travels for your coming adventures.

Babel: #Oh, Traveler. Back from exploring, are you?

Babel: So... Please don't disappoint her and ruin the friendship you have.
Traveler: About Gurabad and Liloupar...
Babel: So the Mother of the Jinni no longer speaks, for she chose to leave us...
Babel: That truly is... lamentable. Still, she returned to her destiny. Perhaps this might be the best ending she, of us all, could have attained.
Babel: But a Jinni's power will not leave their contracted master. The bottle must contain some vestiges of her power, yes?
Babel: Hehe. The Mother of the Jinn might have departed, but the pact remains. I hope that you can take care of it... and yourself... in the desert.
Traveler: See you.
Babel: Farewell, most esteemed guest. Know that you will always be welcome amongst the Tanit.
