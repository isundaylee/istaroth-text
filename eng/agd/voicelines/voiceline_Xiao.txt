# Xiao Voicelines

## Hello
If you awake to a knife at your throat, if monsters dig their claws into you, if death comes knocking at your door... Call out my name. Adeptus Xiao. I will be here when you call.

## Chat: Idleness
Reduced to just standing around... How absurd.

## Chat: Wandering Spirits
The damned will sooner die again than lay a hand on me.

## Chat: Corruption
Grrgh... Those memories, so dark...

## When It Rains
Demons do not stop for the rain. Move.

## After the Rain
The rain stopped? I don't concern myself with the weather.

## When Thunder Strikes
Many mortals fear lightning... Incomprehensible. Fear of something so common.

## When It Snows
Once the snow is thick enough, we can eat it...

## Good Morning
We're wasting time. Let's go.

## Good Afternoon
Lunch... We'll go back to Wangshu Inn.

## Good Evening
Night... When the darkness comes to envelop you. Don't stay outside.

## Good Night
Go. I'll be here.

## About Xiao: Inhuman
I'm far from human. I can't make much of human emotions.

## About Xiao: Liyue
Liyue is changing. Rapidly... Forget it. It means nothing to me.

## About Us: Warnings
If a day comes where even you are taken by the darkness, it will be up to me...

## About Us: Trust
Do not fall prey to the darkness. I have no mercy.
Though, perhaps you can stand your ground alone.

## About Us: Drowsiness
Who's there? Oh... You think I sleep? You have no respect for the ways of the adepti.

## About Us: Lantern Rite
The Lantern Rite? The time for humans to discard their glowing trash into the sea has returned... How childish...
Though, if you insist... I will go with you.

## About the Vision: Desires
Visions? Desire? Ha. Do not judge adepti by your mortal ideals. I have no desire.

## About the Vision: Reasons
Hiding? I'm hiding nothing. I just won't speak of desire to others.
Do you mortals not have a rule about spoken wishes never coming true? Hm? What do you mean that's not the same?

## Something to Share
I deal in death. If you cannot bring yourself to kill — speak my name.

## Interesting things
Dihua Islet was once deserted.
Though that was many decades... no, centuries ago...

## About Zhongli
Can I ask... Zhongli — what does he do with his days? Huh? Birds, antiques, flowers...
Hmm... What deeper meaning do they hold?

## About Beidou
Beidou? I have nothing to do with her. Though there is such a thing as the leviathan. As a mere human, she has proven her power in defeating Haishan.

## About Baizhu
You want... Baizhu to make a medicine to take away my pain? I understand your intentions, but mortal medicine has no effect on adepti.

## About Hu Tao
Hu Tao? Her liveliness is irritating. Fortunately, she is also humorous, so you need not worry about her growing into a boring human.

## About Venti
Venti? So that's the name he goes by. His tunes are... forget it.

## About Ganyu
Ganyu is neither mortal nor illuminated beast. Wandering both the mortal and adepti realms with duty as her sole guide, it was inevitable that she would become perplexed... What? Me? You believe a yaksha who knows nothing more than how to massacre countless souls and emerge unscathed is a suitable mentor for such an individual? ...Your mind occupies a very different world from that which your body inhabits.

## About Shenhe
It seems Shenhe places a great deal of trust in you. Well, how could she not. There are few people in the world as kind and good-natured as you.

## About Yelan
I've heard that she once investigated The Chasm, following the trail of the Millelith. If she can investigate mysteries like that on her own, she must be someone of rare skill.

## More About Xiao: I
I'm willing to protect you.
But don't think about getting close, and stay out of my way, or all that awaits you is regret.

## More About Xiao: II
In the thousands of years that have passed, I have taken countless wraiths. If you want no trouble, stay away from me. See me as a weapon, and nothing more.

## More About Xiao: III
Their voices... I can always hear them. Their screams, their cries, demanding more death...
This is my burden to carry. It has nothing to do with you.

## More About Xiao: IV
Morax...? What do you know of this name!?
He gave me the name Xiao, and released me from the endless pain I endured.
I will not forgive those that dare to speak against him, even you.

## More About Xiao: V
It's too late. The connection between us is too strong. Even if you wanted to, it's too late to sever it. Hm? You've never thought to sever it?
*sigh* This eternal dance of demon subjugation... My fight goes on.
But, I would like to know more about you.

## Xiao's Hobbies
There's nothing timid about you, having the courage to ask about my hobbies.
So, fight me. How long do you think your body will last against my blows?

## Xiao's Troubles
Trouble? Ha. Trouble means nothing to adepti. There is no trouble that can last for a thousand years.

## Favorite Food: Almond Tofu
I have no interest in mortal food. Cooking is tedious and the wait is long. The one thing I can manage to stomach is almond tofu.

## Favorite Food: Memories
The taste of Almond Tofu feels like a fond dream...

## Least Favorite Food
Wait. I am expected to place slices of meat in wrappings myself? And then... eat them? Together? Ugh, humans these days do not know what they are doing.

## Receiving a Gift: I
Mm... Not bad... Why are you staring at me?

## Receiving a Gift: II
No need.

## Receiving a Gift: III
Try something else next time.

## Birthday
This mortal concept of commemorating the day of your birth really is redundant. Ahem. Wait. Uhh, have this. It's a butterfly I made from leaves.
Okay. Take it. It's an adepti amulet — it staves off evil.

## Feelings About Ascension: Intro
This is it? Nothing worth getting excited about.

## Feelings About Ascension: Building Up
New power? All it will be used for is death.

## Feelings About Ascension: Climax
The limit to one's power is self-destruction. Answer me. Why do you persist?

## Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion
Countless souls have fallen prey to these hands. I too have been swallowed by the darkness — and yet you dare to drive me on. You may think of me as... your companion. You seek to find me salvation? 
...You... really are a difficult being to comprehend.

## Elemental Skill: I
Hmph.

## Elemental Skill: II
Boring.

## Elemental Skill: III
Useless.

## Plunging Attacks: I
Here!

## Plunging Attacks: II
Worthless!

## Elemental Burst: I
Disappear!

## Elemental Burst: II
Evil conquering!

## Elemental Burst: III
Lament!

## Opening Treasure Chest: I
If it's useful, I'll take it.

## Opening Treasure Chest: II
Why would anyone want... *sigh* Forget it, it's not my concern.

## Opening Treasure Chest: III
Hmph... there's quality here.

## Low HP: I
Shut it.

## Low HP: II
Prepare to die, fool!

## Low HP: III
*grunts* Good.

## Ally at Low HP: I
...Weak.

## Ally at Low HP: II
Get back if you wanna survive.

## Fallen: I
Is this... retribution?

## Fallen: II
The day... has finally come.

## Fallen: III
Impossible...

## Light Hit Taken: I
That's it?

## Heavy Hit Taken: I
Ugh, get out of my way!

## Joining Party: I
You called?

## Joining Party: II
Evil shall be dispersed.

## Joining Party: III
Conquering demons is what I do.
