Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Tieshan: Rex Lapis... You know, I saw him once, in a crowd. He was disguised as a commoner, so nobody noticed. But I could tell from the way he carried himself â€” everything about him was so dignified and graceful.
Tieshan: How did I know it was him? To be honest, I can't know for sure...
Tieshan: But I believe that everyone in Liyue can recognize the one who founded our nation and watched over us for millennia, even if just by his silhouette.
Tieshan: I'm honestly still struggling to accept his death. Now I'll never know for sure whether it was really him...
Tieshan: We're not really supposed to discuss it to be honest. But if you can't get things off your chest... how can you expect to move on? *sigh* If anyone asks, though, we never had this conversation.
