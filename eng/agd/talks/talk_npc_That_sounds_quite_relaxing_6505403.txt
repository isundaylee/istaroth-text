Traveler: That sounds quite relaxing.
Chatelet: Indeed — the aroma of the coffee available here is wonderful. I can only hope that Arouet will keep making it this way.

Chatelet: Where I work, there is much that many cannot control in their lives already — at least leave them their opinion on coffee.
