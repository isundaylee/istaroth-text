# The Case of the Crafting Bench


## Talk 1

Hampeq: Let's go find Pampa next. It's not far from here.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Now that we've gathered all the testimonies, shouldn't we go back to the Stadium and look for Sumac?

## Talk 3

Sumac: #Thank you, Traveler, Paimon. I feel much better now.
Paimon: Phew! Paimon's glad you're okay. You scared the stuffing out of us!
Traveler: It could have been a tricky misunderstanding to clear up.
Paimon: Exactly! Now that Paimon thinks about it... If that had been some kinda poison, we might be taken for murderers!
Sumac: Oh, it's fine. Not to brag or anything, but I've been in superb health since I was little. Why, I can count the number of times I've fallen sick on one hand. This is no biggie.
Traveler: A will of stone can shatter any obstacle!
Sumac: You're right! That's the resolve warriors should have.
Paimon: C'mon! There are obstacles that even willpower won't let you barge through! Should you really be pushing yourself if you've been poisoned!?
Sumac: True enough — Though I'd say the formula for the potion was fine. It certainly isn't a poison, at any rate.
Paimon: You mean you got it from a trusted source?
Sumac: No, I bought it from a merchant named Soncoyoc. He only comes out after sunset, and it just happened to be night when I ran into him! How lucky!
Paimon: Lucky!? That sounds super suspicious! You totally got scammed — we've gotta find that liar, and set his pants on fire!
Sumac: There's no need for that, really! I trust my eye for people, he's no charlatan — could it really be that the Crafting Bench is having an off-day?
Hampeq: There's a good chance of that — that being the Crafting Bench, I mean. You haven't been the only victims thus far.
Sumac: Mr. Hampeq! Thanks for your help earlier.
Hampeq: No sweat. Treating those who are injured is one of my duties. Regarding the Crafting Bench, have you ever heard about the "Locusts"?
Traveler: First time for me.
Hampeq: It's fine if you've never heard of them. We logistics people have never really cared about being praised or being recognized like the true warriors. As far as we're concerned, ours is still honorable work.
Hampeq: In the past, the Hawkwings — the faction I belong to — has always been in charge of the Stadium's various facilities. Rule-abiding sorts, we are, always doing our best to do our part.
Hampeq: But we've not had many new members join in recent years... We've got experience on our side, but even the best can't be everywhere at once when there's so much to do. Can't say we've made no mistakes, either.
Hampeq: Eventually, after taking the opinions of various parties into account, the Speaker's Chamber ruled that we should regularly hold a tournament in which all factions could participate. The winners would earn the right to carry about our noble work.
Hampeq: We were, unfortunately, beaten, and have temporarily lost that honor. Our successors were the Locusts. They run the show quite differently...
Hampeq: If they'd gone and given the work their all, I'd have no gripes. But — and I'm putting this as generously as possible — I've never seen a bunch of louts as hellbent on profit as they are...
Hampeq: And in the latest tournament, we Hawkwings encountered an unusually high number of accidents, hamstringing our performance.
Hampeq: And many were linked using alchemical potions, just like what happened to Sumac.
Hampeq: I've been thinking that they've done... something... to the Crafting Bench. Before, they were just targeting us Hawkwings, but now others have gotten involved... They've gone way over the line!
Traveler: Umm, you say that, but...
Paimon: We've only just heard of these factions... It does sound like you've got some serious beef, but...
Sumac: Yeah. Without evidence, even the Speaker's Chamber has its hands tied.
Hampeq: It's all my fault! If only I'd been more vigilant... The reason we missed out on collecting hard evidence before is because I never imagined they'd stoop to such low-down, no-good dirty tricks.
Hampeq: I know this sounds crass, but thanks to Sumac's injury, we now have a chance to investigate this affair.
Hampeq: You're an outsider, a third party to this whole conflict. With you as our witnesses, we'll be able to expose The Locusts' perfidy — not just for our sakes, but everyone's.
Sumac: I get where Mr. Hampeq's coming from. If the factions in charge of public amenities are up to no good, we're all in trouble.
Sumac: But my testimony alone won't cut it, will it? If we go back now and check out that Crafting Bench out...
Hampeq: It's already too late. The Locusts are a tricksy bunch. It won't be that easy to unmask them. To be honest, the fact that an outsider to our conflict was injured was... a happy accident.
Hampeq: Whatever the case, there's no doubt that any trace of tampering will have been scrubbed clean by the time we investigate the Crafting Bench.
Sumac: Hmm... You seem intimately familiar with how the Locusts operate.
Hampeq: Of course. They're our rivals, the ones who stole our glory from us...
Hampeq: ...Anyway, since there's no tournament on today, I'm going to collect testimony from some previous victims. Would you two mind coming along?
Traveler: Oh boy! Is that drudgery I smell...?
Hampeq: You'll be rewarded generously. This I guarantee.
Paimon: Guess we just can't refuse requests for help, can we?
Hampeq: You rest here first, Sumac. We'll meet up with you again once we have the evidence we need.
Sumac: Alright. *sigh* Sorry for dragging you two into this.
Paimon: Don't say that! If you had to blame someone... then, uh, blame the Locusts! Yeah, so we're doing this for the good of everyone!
Hampeq: That's right. What we do, we do for the benefit of all, and it is a good thing indeed. Anyway, no time to lose. Let's go down to the outdoor training grounds and collect some testimony.
Traveler: A fair sum makes drudgery quite tolerable.
Hampeq: And a fair sum you shall have.
Traveler: An utterly despicable pack of scoundrels!
Paimon: You say that, but those are just guesses right now, aren't they?
Traveler: Oh yeah, sure, they're the whos in the where doing the whatsits, yeah?
Paimon: Don't act like you're in the know when you obviously don't have a clue!
Traveler: Poison isn't exactly a common cold.

## Talk 4

Anela: Sour Sauce Ceviche again...?
Traveler: What's wrong with Sour Sauce Ceviche?
Anela: Nothing, really, it's fine. But no matter how good it is, you can't just keep eating the same thing day after day, can you? Though on the other hand, Ripple's been getting a bit pudgy lately, hasn't he? Odd, neither his training nor his caloric intake have changed...
Traveler: I shan't disturb you any longer.
Anela: Aw, it's fine!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Wait, we're back near the Stadium of the Sacred Flame again? Gah, he's so quick! We only lost sight for a second, and now he's gone...
Paimon: #Good thing he left footprints, though! Let's follow his tracks, Traveler!

## Talk 6

Hampeq: Hey, Ogun, it's been a while. You still remember the Crafting Bench incident? Just wanted to hear what you have to say about that...
Ogun: Seriously? You're still hung up about that? What's the point?
Hampeq: Don't you worry, I've got my ways.
Ogun: Is your way relying on outsiders to interfere?
Traveler: And here we see dissent in its natural habitat, slaying a cause so the foe need not.
Hampeq: Sorry. I know we're not making the best account of ourselves...
Ogun: Outsider you are, and outsider you remain. However...
Ogun: Pass my training. Prove yourself worthy of my trust. Ask again after that, and you'll get your answers.
Paimon: Wait, aren't we here to get testimonies? How did this turn into a test of strength?
Hampeq: Sorry, can't help you there. We Hawkwings have traditionally prized strength above all else, and Ogun's an archconservative even by our conservative standards...
Hampeq: Better to just take his challenge rather than waste your breath. I have faith in your abilities.
Paimon: Okay then...
Ogun: Done thinking it over? Ready to accept my challenge?
Traveler: Bring it on.
Traveler: I'll need a moment to prepare.
Ogun: See to it, and then come to me.
Traveler: Could you consider me "elite reinforcements" instead?

## Talk 7

Paimon: Well, how was that? Strong enough for you?
Ogun: A diamond in the rough, but a diamond nonetheless. What do you want to know?
Black Screen Text: As agreed, Ogun tells of his previous ordeal, sparing no detail. Hampeq in turn records the testimony as given.
Ogun: Pah. But what's the use of taking all this testimony? It's a waste of time.
Hampeq: He is no warrior who gives up before battle is joined. I will give it my all, regardless of what you say.
Ogun: Suit yourself, then.

## Talk 8

Pampa: Amazing. Simply amazing!
Traveler: Did you get all that? There'll be a test later.
Paimon: Wait, were you really trying to teach him? We're here to collect testimonies, you know!
Pampa: 'Course we can, I'm a man of my word. I'll tell you all I know.
Black Screen Text: Pampa vividly recounts the mishap he encountered before, which Hampeq records in a more concise form.
Hampeq: Thank you for your testimony. With this, we're one solid step closer to reclaiming the honor that is rightfully ours.
Paimon: Really? He sure did a great job telling the story, but as for how useful it'll be...
Pampa: Hey now, that's where you're a mistaken lil' miss. Form is about decorum, and decorum is crucial, you hear? Crucial! But in case you've never heard, stay a while, and listen...
Paimon: Err... Can we just go now?
Hampeq: Then it's time we went to find Anela. She should be with the People of the Springs at this time. But before that...
Black Screen Text: You follow Hampeq to a secluded spot.
Paimon: What's with all the mystery?
Hampeq: Well, this friend is... special. Sorry for the wait, Tozan. About that thing we agreed on earlier...
Tozan: Well, I'm here now, aren't I? Sure was a pain in the neck to squirrel these things out under the noses of my factionmates, though.
Hampeq: My thanks. I'm afraid we'll have need of you in the future, too.
Tozan: Aw, come on! This is for everyone's benefit, isn't it?
Hampeq: Yes, indeed it is. You're a good fellow, worthy of respect. Until you showed up, I'd never have thought that a Locust would go against their own faction's interests...
Tozan: Ah, to be honest, it breaks my heart to know that some of us have sunk to such contemptible conduct.
Tozan: And yet, as a Locust, it'd be difficult for me to change the status quo, so some external help is quite welcome indeed.
Paimon: Wait, so you're helping the Hawkwings on the sly, then? W—Wouldn't that make you a traitor?
Tozan: Ah! Why put it in such harsh terms? Are our goals not aligned — to expose evildoers and see them punished?
Tozan: Well then. The hour grows late, so I'll be taking my leave. If you need anything else, just contact me. Good luck to you.
Black Screen Text: Tozan leaves without a sound...
Paimon: So, what he gave you was...
Hampeq: Intel on The Locusts, of course. It will buttress our testimony all the more. Honestly, I'm glad to know that reasonable people like Tozan still exist in that swarm of locusts.
Hampeq: Alright, let's keep gathering evidence. We can't let his goodwill go to waste. We'll find Anela over with the People of the Springs.
Traveler: We can get down to business now, right?

## Talk 9

Hampeq: Found you at last, Anela. Would you reconsider the matter I wrote to you about?
Anela: Stickier than a tick, you are, chasing me all the way here. Well? What's in it for me?
Hampeq: ...I mean, you are a member of the Hawkwings...
Anela: I "was." I may be a good swimmer, but that doesn't mean I'll stay onboard your sinking ship.
Hampeq: Couldn't you at least provide some testimony?
Anela: And drop myself in the pot of trouble you're brewing?
Paimon: Eh, this feels like a waste of time. We should just go back and look for Sumac.
Anela: Oh? Well, well, who are these two little cuties? Help you hired, Hampeq?
Hampeq: Y—You could say that.
Anela: #Good. I've changed my mind. Youngsters with potential are just my jam. How about this, little lad? If you pass my test, I'll consider giving you a statement after all.
Traveler: Color me shocked and surprised — a test.
Paimon: Guess they really are part of the same faction, huh?
Anela: Ah, very good! Shall we begin?
Traveler: Bring it on.
Traveler: Let me make some preparations.
Anela: No rush, take your time.
Traveler: Gotta admit, I'm not feeling it right now...
Anela: And would a little... extra reward from yours truly sweeten the pot?
Paimon: Please let us give it a go!

## Talk 10

Anela: #You're quite the budding talent, for sure. Y'know what? Forget Hampeq — why don't you join up with me instead, lad?
Traveler: Sounds good. Let's talk terms and compensation.
Paimon: Hey!
Paimon: Let's get back on topic, shall we? We're here to get her testimony, y'know.
Anela: That how it is? Shame. But I did agree, so...
Black Screen Text: Anela lazily relates her unpleasant encounter, while Hampeq pens it down faithfully in its entirety.
Hampeq: That should be all our testimonies squared away... Are you really not coming back, Anela? Should we succeed this time...
Anela: You can invite me after the fact. You should know I can't stand men who are clingy despite being total failures — or do you?
Anela: Of course, you kids are a different story — my door's always open to you. And if you'd rather take this to a hot spring...
Paimon: Err, w—we're busy right now! Byeee!
Traveler: No thanks. I've still got a ton of commissions on my docket...

## Talk 11

Tozan: So you're here just to gloat and revel in the humiliation of a defeated opponent? That's not a hobby I'd flaunt.

## Talk 12

Paimon: We're back, Sumac. Sorry to keep you waiting!
Sumac: Hey there! You were gone a pretty long time, to be honest. Did the testimony gathering not go so well?
Paimon: Well... The Hawkwings have some really weird rules. We had to pass tests before they'd talk to us! And the reasons they gave were all over the place...
Paimon: If we got a certificate for every test we passed, Paimon would totally be a Master already!
Traveler: Yeah, we're definitely due for a title upgrade.
Sumac: Haha, I see. Shame I wasn't there to see everything go down, then! Bet I'd have become a skilled fighter in my own right by now.
Paimon: You're passionate about martial training, aren't you? Still, Paimon's not sure the Hawkwings' methods would be for you.
Paimon: Speaking of which, Hampeq, it seems like you aren't exactly everyone's favorite fellow. Weren't you all companions once?
Sumac: Huh? Sorry, did something happen?
Paimon: Well, they're... kinda detached? Like they don't care about what you're doing? Or maybe they don't approve?
Paimon: It's so strange. Isn't exposing wrongdoing and punishing perpetrators the right thing to do? So why would they act like that...?
Hampeq: I'm afraid that the Hawkwings' being scattered like so many grains of sand is a disgrace I must bear responsibility for as one of its members.
Hampeq: Still, I hope that this is our chance to reunite — I'll do anything to regain our honor.
Hampeq: I mean, don't they say that the truth oft winds up in the custody of the few? I won't throw in the towel just because I'm in the minority.
Traveler: I've heard that one before.
Hampeq: Well, the truth will be revealed soon, won't it? The Speaker's Chamber will judge based on the evidence both parties provide, so please, I'd like to ask you to be present as witnesses.
Sumac: Hmm... Are you sure my testimony would be valid? Maybe I just had an accident that was totally unrelated to the Locusts.
Paimon: Also, couldn't you just get Sumac to take the stand? What would we be there for?
Hampeq: No, all of your testimony is absolutely necessary. Don't worry, I won't ask you to act against your convictions or involve you in anything unjust. Just tell the truth — that'll do.
Sumac: Hmm... Well, you did help me when I was injured earlier, Mr. Hampeq, so I owe you that much.
Paimon: #Is it really necessary? Oh well... We might as well help get to the bottom of this, huh, Traveler?
Hampeq: Thank you all! In that case, let us meet at the outside training grounds in two days.
Traveler: You could always be in the minority because you're mistaken, you know.

## Talk 13

Paimon: Huh, that's quite the crowd! Paimon's getting a bit nervous...
Sumac: #Hey there, Traveler, Paimon!
Paimon: Sumac! There you are. How are you feeling?
Sumac: Great, thanks to you! Actually, I ended up going to other Crafting Benches to try that potion...
Paimon: ...Wow, you've got guts.
Sumac: And it seems like the formula's fine — so yeah, told you I've got a good eye. The problem must've been with the Crafting Bench, then.
Sumac: Ah, look, we should be starting soon. See that person in the middle? That's Mr. Tenehua, the judge sent by the Speaker's Chamber.
Sumac: The people facing Mr. Hampeq should be Locust members... Only two of them? That's fewer people than we have!
Traveler: (Huh, he looks familiar...)
Paimon: (Ohh, right, so he really was a Locust. But wait, why's he standing on that side...?)
Tenehua: Ahem. It's about time, so let us get started. I'm sure that all present are well aware of this dispute, so I shall cut to the chase.
Tenehua: State your case, Hampeq.
Hampeq: My thanks for the chance to speak. Everyone knows that the Locusts have replaced us Hawkwings for some time now. Yet, such grudges will not simply vanish.
Hampeq: I'm sure it also goes without saying that we are still capable competitors. If we emerged victorious in another tournament, we would reclaim the glory that was once ours.
Hampeq: But it just so happened that, on the eve of the event, our various contestants met with mishap after mishap... And each victim shared something in common: Their accident happened after using a Locust-managed Crafting Bench.
Hampeq: I don't imagine it's a stretch to conclude that the Locusts were the sole beneficiaries of the resultant injuries. As such, we can see that they had both the motive and the ability to put such a plan into practice...
Itzcuin: Just one minute there, bro, I'm going to ask you to slow your roll. Motives and capabilities are one thing, but doing it is a whole different ball game.
Itzcuin: Also, let's be real, you're not the only ones who have beef with us. You know how it is. "When you've got 99 problems, what's a couple mo'?"
Itzcuin: You think we've got the time to go around exacting revenge, one by one... And besides, I haven't heard of too many people getting injured after using Crafting Benches lately. You sure it's not just your persecution complex acting up?
Hampeq: There haven't been many cases "lately," but they happened, didn't they? And the fact that such targeted attacks stopped happening just as I started investigating is quite unnatural, don't you think?
Hampeq: Moreover, there was a recent victim — someone completely uninvolved in this conflict, in fact.
Hampeq: Sumac, that young lady over there, suddenly felt unwell after ingesting a potion crafted using one of your Crafting Benches just a few days ago. She had to be carried back to the Stadium for treatment.
Hampeq: #The outlander travelers Traveler and Paimon can corroborate her testimony, and the two of them were also present when I collected testimonies from the Hawkwing victims.
Sumac: Mr. Hampeq speaks the truth. I did verify if the formula was suitable afterward. I can only conclude that the Crafting Bench itself was faulty somehow...
Paimon: Yeah, and speaking of what happened that day, we didn't use that Crafting Bench in the first place because it seemed weird.
Hampeq: #Here also are the victim testimonies, good judge, that I gathered together with Traveler and Paimon. If you would, you two?
Traveler: Side? I don't remember joining the Hawkwings.
Sumac: That's true... Well, be that as it may, you could still say that we're on the side of truth, right?

## Talk 14

Tlalepa: Let me out of here and fight us again if you dare! You hear me!?

## Talk 15

Ogun: As for today's training... Yes, that should do it.
Traveler: About what happened before...
Ogun: Though the process had a few twists and turns, the outcome was as I expected.
Ogun: ...Are you waiting for more commentary? But I've already said all I wish to.
Traveler: I'll leave you to it, then.
Ogun: Very well.

## Talk 16

Tozan: Tlalepa! Tlalepa! Bad news!
Tlalepa: *yawn* Seriously? What're you yelling about? Disturbed my beauty sleep, you did.
Tozan: Someone's exposed us! I was able to smooth it over for the time being, but...
Paimon: (Wait a minute, we've got two Tozans here!)
Traveler: (Twins. As I thought.)
Tlalepa: Seriously, bro? Did you invite those two "guests" over as well? And are they here to get pranked, or are you pranking me?
Tozan: It's you two...
Paimon: To think you two set up shop right under the noses of everyone who goes to the Stadium and didn't get discovered! Is this what they call "hiding in plain sight"?
Paimon: You two... Uh, pieces of evidence! We already know your secret. Come with us to the Speaker's Chamber, and let us hear the truth!
Tlalepa: Well, I'll have to request that you keep our little secret. Big Bro, you're the one who brought this on us, so you're going to owe me.
Tozan: Sure.
Paimon: What? Keep your secret? We're on the side of truth here! We're not that easy to bribe...
Tlalepa: Don't get ahead of yourself — Who said anything about a bribe? There's only one way you can be sure a secret's kept.
Traveler: (Wow, they do look exactly the same!)

## Talk 17

Black Screen Text: You lock the two of them in the cages for now...
Paimon: Hmph. You two were small time!
Traveler: I'm honestly more curious...
Traveler: ...What made you think two-on-one would be fair odds — for you, I mean?
Tlalepa: You... You little brat! You're not what you seem at all! ...Two fists against four is unfair, but you alone count for eight at least!
Paimon: Pfft. Don't be silly. Paimon counts four fists on your team, and four on ours. Fair's fair, and you lost square!
Tozan: Alright. You win this round. But what about it? Sure, I pulled a trick or two... Does that mean Hampeq's a saint?
Tozan: You all saw how dumbstruck he was. Everyone did. The Hawkwings' credibility's completely bust. Nothing you do will change that.
Tozan: I've already won! Reveal my secrets to the Chamber all you want. You won't save the Hawkwings...
Traveler: That's not for me to decide.
Paimon: That's right. We're on the side of the truth, nothing more, nothing less! Judging your dispute is up to the Speaker's Chamber.
Paimon: We should be fine leaving them here for a bit, right? We've gotta hoof it back to the Stadium and tell Tenehua...
Traveler: I've no interest in your grievances.

## Talk 18

Wooden Crate: A—achoo!
Wooden Crate: ...

## Talk 19

Sumac: Well, are you ready?
Traveler: Bring it on.
Sumac: I was waiting for you to say that.
Traveler: Hold on...
Sumac: No worries.

## Talk 20

Sumac: Has the mood changed? I feel like I'm getting nervous, too...

## Talk 21

Pampa: Yo, you've got time to come here?
Traveler: Do we know you?
Pampa: We've met, we've talked, so we're friends! Besides, weren't we on the same side during that thing? Don't say you've forgotten already!
Traveler: I'm on my own side.
Pampa: *sigh* Fine, you're right, you're right. I heard even Mr. Tenehua really admires you. Being your friend is a great honor!
Traveler: I should get going.
Pampa: Don't let me keep you!

## Talk 22

Sumac: Haha, I didn't think I'd get beaten as soon as I arrived at the Stadium. This story's going to be a riot for my friends back home.
Traveler: Being the butt of a joke amongst friends is worth it sometimes.
Sumac: I think so too! My friends call it a kind of "unhealthy masochism," though... But I don't think my health has been negatively affected, so I'm probably fine.
Traveler: Must be saddening to have your friends laugh at you.
Sumac: You think so? I don't think they mean any harm. It was a pretty funny scene at any rate — I wouldn't mind if you laughed too.

## Talk 23

Ogun: Ready?
Traveler: Let's begin.
Traveler: Wait a moment.
Ogun: Will do.

## Talk 24

Hampeq: Much obliged, then.

## Talk 25

Hampeq: Pampa, we're here about...
Pampa: Oh, I've been waiting. Heard you all just fine, and reckoned I'd be next — just didn't expect to sit through one of Ogun's old-grumbler lectures first.
Paimon: Nice! That saves us the trouble of explaining. You can start anytime — we'll write it all down!
Pampa: Oh, no need to be hasty... "Pass my training. Prove yourself worthy of trust. Ask again after that, and you'll get your answers."
Paimon: This again? Why!?
Pampa: Don't you think you learn a lot just by watching others overcome obstacles? And if you don't think so, I sure do.
Pampa: As such, I too would like a chance to learn from you, in return for my testimony. Can't let Ogun monopolize all the fun like that, now can we?
Paimon: ...Is that how this works?
Pampa: Of course. Why wouldn't it be? And if you're willing, let's start now!
Traveler: The sooner the better.
Traveler: One moment. Let me prep.
Pampa: Of course. Making a mistake because you're in bad form would suck.

## Talk 26

Hampeq: I'll leave submitting the victims' testimonies to you.

## Talk 27

Pampa: You ready? It is better to be patient at times like this... You can take your time, I'm in no hurry!
Traveler: Let's begin.
Traveler: Wait a moment.
Pampa: Don't worry, I'm super patient!

## Talk 28

Hampeq: *sigh* I'm counting on you two.

## Talk 29

Anela: Oh, it's you. Did you make a trip out here just to have some fun with me?
Traveler: About what happened before...
Anela: You've reconsidered my invitation? Or are you thinking of something else?
Anela: If you're asking about Hampeq, all I can say is that he brought it on himself. Sure, his opponents were in the wrong, but is he really completely blameless?
Anela: Oh my! I hope it doesn't sound like I'm kicking him while he's down. Well, for the sake of my reputation, let's keep that between us for now.
Traveler: I've got other things to take care of, so I'll be going now.
Anela: Oh, really? Such a pity. You be careful out there~

## Talk 30

Anela: #Ready for the test, lad?
Traveler: Bring it on.
Traveler: Hold on...
Anela: Hehe, sure, no problem.

## Talk 31

Tenehua: Pass the Hawkwings victim testimonies to me once you're ready.

## Talk 32

Tenehua: Well, it certainly appears that this is no groundless accusation after all. Any objections, Itzcuin?
Itzcuin: Alright, so, let's just say that the Crafting Bench we're responsible for has malfunctioned. That, at most, amounts to... what, negligent management?
Itzcuin: I mean, not like we hogged all the glory for ages like the Hawkwings, so we're a bit lacking in experience. Some mistakes are bound to happen. Gotta give us newbies a chance, right?
Itzcuin: As for our forerunners, we've got nothing but respect for 'em — But accusing us of sabotaging them? Now that's just too much!
Itzcuin: How about this? We'll actively discuss compensation with those who suffered losses due to our oversight. Will that do?
Hampeq: Don't think I'm blind to the strawman you're propping up! You clearly deliberately targeted us Hawkwings. There's no way this was unintentional or the result of some kinda negligence!
Itzcuin: And do you have proof of malicious intent? Don't think you can get that from the victim testimonies.
Hampeq: Of course I do! In fact, I've got intel from within your little gang!
Hampeq: See the Loach Pearls on this invoice? The timing of the Locusts' mass purchase of them coincides exactly with that of the Hawkwings' mishaps.
Hampeq: Now, we all know that Loach Pearls are not materials that need to be stockpiled in large amounts, and similar substances were found in the potions imbibed by the victims.
Itzcuin: ...Where did you get that invoice?
Hampeq: From a member of your corrupt organization whose conscience hasn't yet breathed its last, of course.
Paimon: (Judging by his reaction, that sure hit him where it hurts!)
Hampeq: #For safety reasons, I will not disclose this stout-hearted person's name. But I guarantee that Traveler and Paimon were there when I received the invoice, and they can corroborate the event.
Traveler: We were indeed.
Paimon: Yeah, they even said it broke their heart to witness such contemptible conduct by other Locusts...
Itzcuin: Really? And here I thought we were famous for being earnest dullards. Didn't know we had someone that eloquent on staff. I'd really like to meet 'em.
Itzcuin: Hmph. Anyway, let's just assume the list in your hands is genuine. So what? It's circumstantial evidence — your accusation remains mere speculation.
Itzcuin: This invoice could just as well point to some rotten, traitorous Locusts using our operating funds to buy the Loach Pearls so they can build an artificial hot spring in their backyard.
Itzcuin: And wouldn't that be a terrible disgrace for us? Don't worry, I promise we'll investigate thoroughly, and then give a full accounting to everyone. How's that?
Hampeq: How unsightly. Are you really going to just deny everything to the bitter end?
Itzcuin: More like your evidence just doesn't cut it.
Hampeq: How about this, then? This picture clearly shows someone tampering with the Crafting Bench, with a chest full of Loach Pearls next to them!
Paimon: Uh, that person sure looks familiar... Isn't that you, Sumac?
Sumac: Ah, so it is!
Traveler: What a coincidence...
Paimon: Sure is!
Itzcuin: Didn't expect such a move from you, to be sure... But please, everyone, think for a second. Is this stuff actually proving his claims, or is it simply more of the same old circumstantial evidence?
Itzcuin: Even if this picture could prove that someone tampered with the Bench, can you prove that person to be a Locust?
Hampeq: And if I said that this picture was given to me by a Locust, just like that invoice?
Tenehua: #Well, then. Would you, Traveler and Paimon, be able to vouch for that?
Traveler: No, I don't remember that happening...
Paimon: This is the first time we're seeing this picture, and judging by your reaction, Sumac, this is your first time as well, right?
Sumac: Nope, never. Sorry, Mr. Hampeq, but we can't give false testimony.
Itzcuin: So, does this "stout-hearted" person you speak of truly exist? Or did you conspire with those fellows over there to invent this story out of whole cloth?
Itzcuin: We're a united lot, we Locusts — is that not how we overcame you scattered Hawkwings? I find it... difficult to imagine that we'd have a turncoat amongst us.
Paimon: #We take on almost any request, but we've got principles, too! We wouldn't lie at a time like this, right, Traveler?
Tenehua: Hmm... Though it does seem that the Locusts are not above suspicion, this is not enough to make a final judgment.
Tenehua: If your "stout-hearted" special friend could testify in person, Hampeq, that would make things much simpler! But you claim that there's no such person, yes, Itzcuin?
Itzcuin: Absolutely. There's no way a traitor exists among our ranks.
Tenehua: Well, since this has reached an impasse, there's no point in continuing. Unless you have something to add, Hampeq, let's call it for today.
Tenehua: Still, before we adjourn, please submit the evidence you just presented.
Traveler: I cannot.
Traveler: Are you some sort of important figure, to be under surveillance like that?
Sumac: Huh? Would someone as ordinary as me really need monitoring?
Traveler: We did indeed encounter a "special friend."

## Talk 33

Tenehua: You'll have to submit... the Locusts' Purchase Invoice. Ready?

## Talk 34

Paimon: *sigh* Looks like this is the end of the line, Hampeq.
Hampeq: N—No, we still... We can still... Mr. Tenehua, I'd like to identify the Locust member who provided me with the intel.
Paimon: Eh!? W—Wait a minute... That's not a good idea, is it!?
Hampeq: But before that, I hope that the Speaker's Chamber can extend protection to the person I'm going to identify. That will be no problem, yes?
Tenehua: We can consider it. This Crafting Bench affair is an affair neither big nor small, but the Speaker's Chamber nonetheless hopes for a straightforward end to the dispute.
Tenehua: If both sides agree to this, I assure you that we will not allow any acts of retaliation from the Locusts.
Hampeq: Of course he'd agree. He said it himself, that our goals were aligned — to expose evildoers and see them punished.
Hampeq: In fact, I believe that he came here today precisely because he agrees. Isn't that right, Tozan?
Itzcuin: Y'hear that? He named you the traitor.
Tozan: Well, that's trouble. I've got no idea what you're talking about, Mr. Hampeq. I know you're in a hurry to find some way out, but you've got the wrong guy.
Hampeq: What? What's wrong with you? Didn't you give me the Crafting Bench picture yourself? That facility is managed by the Locusts, so only you could have taken that photo...
Tozan: Well, that's just the thing. I checked that photo, and the Crafting Bench in it isn't one under our management.
Paimon: Ugh, Paimon's getting lost already. We first met Sumac at the Stadium of the Sacred Flame, didn't we? So that Bench must've been the one there, right?
Sumac: Exactly, I remember it clearly. That was my first time at the Stadium, and I was happy to make good friends, only to meet misfortune not long after.
Tozan: So, can we take that to mean that the Crafting Bench was a fake, then?
Paimon: A fake Crafting Bench? How can that be?
Tozan: Well, if people can fabricate evidence, is a fake Crafting Bench that unbelievable? You know, other than the question of motive—
Itzcuin: I mean, it's not like someone would pour effort into a fake Crafting Bench with which to frame us Locusts, not caring if they injured an innocent passerby in the course of fabricating their evidence...
Itzcuin: ...Before attempting to use scummy tricks to try and create internal strife between us?
Hampeq: #B—But what about the invoice? Traveler and Paimon were both there when you handed it to me on the tournament rest day. They can vouch for me!
Paimon: (Let's not think too hard about Tozan's change in attitude first. Let's just tell the truth.)
Traveler: We did indeed see him.
Itzcuin: Wait, you mean when the day we had no tournament on? Well, that's weird, because, dear judge Mr. Tenehua, I clearly recall we were soaking in a hot spring on the People of the Springs' turf that very same day.
Paimon: What? But we saw him, and so close to this place, too...
Itzcuin: Hey, hey, now that's crazy talk if I've ever heard it. How can one person be in two places at once? But I had to take a guess based on a certain someone's nature, the one you saw might've been a fake.
Itzcuin: I mean, with the Crafting Bench a fake and the witness a bust... Are we sure we can trust the invoice? Are we sure it's not all nonsense?
Itzcuin: I'm sure everyone here can figure it out — this is all a frame-up!
Paimon: ...A frame-up?
Tozan: #That's right. Whether the Crafting Bench, the injured Sumac, Traveler and Paimon, who were roped in as witnesses... You orchestrated all this yourself, didn't you, Hampeq?
Tozan: You know that the scattered Hawkwings weren't any match for us. That's why you had to resort to dirty tricks.
Tozan: Shame, though. You were destined to fail the moment you decided to forge evidence.
Tozan: Lies will always be exposed. And now, everyone will look upon your every word with suspicion. It won't matter what evidence you present...
Tozan: "Will it be a fake, just like before?" That's what everyone won't be able to help but think!
Tozan: There's no credibility left in the Hawkwings, and you're the one to blame — serves you right, thinking that you could indulge your selfish desires under the guise of "justice."
Hampeq: ...
Tenehua: Nothing to say, then? *sigh* This has proved more complicated than I anticipated. I'm afraid my judgment will have to wait for another day.
Tenehua: #Traveler, Paimon, you were deceived into giving false testimony, so I shall not press charges against you this time.
Traveler: But my eyes didn't deceive me...
Paimon: That's right. Paimon was there too! We saw it with our own eyes, and even talked to him! It was him for sure!
Tenehua: So you mean to call me, the judge, a liar?
Paimon: Well, we're not saying that! Hmm... H—Hey, say something, Hampeq... Or was the Tozan we met that day an impostor you put up to the job?
Hampeq: Impossible. That was the Tozan I know. And he did give me the Crafting Bench picture... I've been had! I don't know how he did it, though...
Hampeq: And the situation is as he says... I could not explain the most crucial mystery, and now, my every word arouses suspicion! ...I've already utterly lost!
Sumac: Hey, chin up, Mr. Hampeq! We warriors of Natlan don't call throw in the towel that easily. Like I said, I've got a good eye for people... I know you're not lying.
Sumac: Itzcuin was confident when he spoke, and didn't seem like one to purposely lie. But Tozan... Now that's an experienced liar.
Paimon: But from what happened just now, everyone must've been convinced that Hampeq was the architect of all this...
Paimon: Ugh, Paimon doesn't know who to trust anymore... Now she's even doubting your words, Sumac! I—Is this what they call a "crisis of confidence"?
Traveler: At times like these, a little out-of-the-box thinking is needed.
Paimon: Out of the box? How?
Traveler: It's not that Hampeq intended this as a frame-up from the start.
Traveler: Rather, Tozan saw all this coming, and struck first.
Paimon: Uh... Huh?
Sumac: So you mean that, suspecting that Mr. Hampeq's investigation might turn up something for real and actually hurt the Locusts...
Sumac: ...Tozan pretended to help, only to lure him into making the wrong decisions so he could use the case to destroy the Hawkwings' credibility?
Paimon: Hmm... That's definitely possible!
Itzcuin: Hello? This thing's over! A done deal! Seriously, this is getting more ludicrous by the moment. What idiocy are you gonna spew next? Going to say we Locusts bought out the judge and had him commit perjury?
Tenehua: I know you don't doubt your eyes, but neither do I.
Sumac: Hmm... I doubt Mr. Tenehua's lying. There's only one possibility left, which is that you all saw Tozan on the same day, but in different places.
Paimon: But a person can't be in two places at once, can they...?
Sumac: Well, just like with the Crafting Bench where we first met, Paimon.
Traveler: There were likely two Crafting Benches at the Stadium then.
Paimon: Two Benches? So you mean that the real one was still in its original spot, and we just encountered a fake, then?
Paimon: Though you say it was fake... But it wasn't much different from the real deal. If it hadn't been tampered with, it would've functioned normally.
Traveler: Exactly, so both Crafting Benches were genuine.
Traveler: Just like there is no fake Tozan — instead, there are two of him.
Paimon: Two... Tozans...? OH! Paimon knows where you going with this!
Tenehua: Haha, well, if I hadn't known the man himself for so long, I might have seriously considered your hypothesis... Actually, maybe I should give it some thought, hmm?
Tozan: ...I'm afraid this nonsense is not worth wasting your precious time on, sir.
Tenehua: Oh, come on, Tozan, I was just joking. No need to be so nervous! Anyway, we're done for today. Hampeq, Itzcuin, you stay for a bit. I'll need you to come with me to the Speaker's Chamber...
Tenehua: And as for the rest of you, you're free to go.
Tozan: I've got other things to do. See you.
Black Screen Text: Tozan leaves in silence.
Paimon: *sigh* For a moment there, Paimon thought we'd be able to, y'know...
Paimon: Shazam! Turn things around at the last second, an epic climax!
Paimon: But guess not. Not that we could provide anything more than guesses, though... What we really needed was two Tozans, right in front of us!
Sumac: Hmm... You know, we might actually have a chance at that. Have you heard the story of the foolish thief, Paimon?
Paimon: The foolish thief...? C'mon, don't keep Paimon on tenterhooks, just tell the story!
Sumac: Alright, alright. Relax. So there was once a foolish thief who stole a gem from someone, and hid it in a place only he knew of.
Sumac: The owner of the gem only knew who it was who had committed the theft, not where the gem was hidden. But he was a smart man, and so he said to the thief...
Sumac: "Hey, you! Thief! I know you stole my gem, so I've nicked it right back. Don't believe me? Go see for yourself!"
Paimon: #The owner's smart, so that's gotta be Traveler and Paimon. That makes the thief and the gem...
Paimon: #Ah! Paimon's got it, for sure this time! C'mon, Traveler, let's catch up with Tozan. He'll bring us right to his "gem" hidey-hole!
Traveler: I'm many things, but not a perjurer.

## Talk 35

Pampa: Is it worth getting that angry over? Honestly...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Pampa: *sigh* You'll really listen? That means a lot. Our little group broke up, you know? And it'd actually been a while, but then suddenly an old friend came knocking...
Pampa: Why else would someone suddenly connect out of the blue, unless they needed to borrow some money? Anyway, since we were once pretty tight buds, I gotta lend him at least a little, yeah? But oh no, this guy, not only did he not say thanks, he even told me off for not giving him enough!
Pampa: He even said something about how after the Hawkwings won back their rightful place he'd give me back double, blah blah.... *sigh* Not sure if he's just pigheaded or... Anyway, I'm an adult and generous to boot, so I decided to help as much as I could.
Pampa: I practically wanna give myself a medal!
Traveler: Sorry for disturbing you.
Pampa: Huh? Leaving already, just like that? Alrighty, then...

## Talk 36

Ogun: As for today's training... Yes, that should do it.
Traveler: What are you doing here?
Ogun: I'm a coach. Other than developing training regimens, I don't have much else to do.
Traveler: Sorry to bother you.
Ogun: Mm-hmm.

## Talk 37

Paimon: Tenehua! Good thing you're still here...
Black Screen Text: You tell him the whole tale...
Tenehua: I've known Tozan for ages. Before he joined the Locusts, even... I've never heard he had a twin brother...
Tenehua: Could it be that he and this Tlalepa been switching places all this time, and we just didn't notice...?
Tenehua: It's quite hard to believe... But I doubt you'd joke about something like this.
Paimon: Oh, you won't be laughing when you get to their hiding place. In fact, you'll be shocked! It's definitely much closer than you think!
Tenehua: Indeed, this is something I must personally verify. And if that's the case, some old cases will require reinvestigating... I'll be busy in the coming days, I expect.
Tenehua: Whatever the case, thank you both very much.
Paimon: Yeah, don't worry, we just don't like scammers... Speaking of which, Sumac helped a lot this time, didn't she?
Tenehua: Indeed, and I will remember it. Once the dust settles, I'll ensure that she is rewarded.
Tenehua: Now, I'd love to stay and chat, but as I have important matters at hand, please excuse me.
Tenehua: Again, thank you, and I hope things go well with you.
