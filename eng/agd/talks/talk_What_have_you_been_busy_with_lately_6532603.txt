Traveler: What have you been busy with lately?
Este: Since that incident, I've discovered that hypnosis is indeed a most promising research direction.
Este: Just think about it! In a dream, all your fantasies could easily come true, could they not?
Este: As such, I've read the notes Grispan left behind. I'm not sure I'll do better than him, but I can at least add to the field.
Este: He's sure to be impressed when he returns!
