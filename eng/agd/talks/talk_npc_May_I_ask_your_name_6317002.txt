# Talk Dialog

Traveler: May I ask your name?
Yasuda: Haha, ah, I'm just an ordinary elderly person.
Yasuda: After retiring from the Tenryou Commission, I don't really have much to do. I come out and walk around every day to listen to the birds, to feed the cats and dogs, and to look at the view.
Yasuda: I was always busy when I was young. I never knew that Inazuma had such beautiful cherry blossoms, or that the creeks here were so clear and wonderful...
Yasuda: We age, but the world remains. So all I want to do now is enjoy the rest of the life I have left.
