Qiming: Hello there. Are you here to have your fortune told, by any chance?
Qiming: Every Lantern Rite, many people come to me to have their fortunes read, whether it be for their careers, their health, their literal fortunes... The works.
Qiming: It's actually a little bothersome, but more income is more income. I can't complain.
Qiming: And now that that fellow who keeps bugging me about his romantic prospects is gone, I can finally have some peace of mind...

Traveler: Antiques?
Qiming: That's right! I might make a meager living doing fortune-telling down at the docks, but I still love collecting antique items.
Qiming: Linlang is infamously shrewd when it comes to money, we've been acquainted for years and she never budges a Mora on the price... Maybe I don't have enough charm?
Qiming: It's strange though, because my divination clearly said my chances of finding true love today are optimal...

## Talk 1

Zhihua: Madam Qiming, this time I should like for you to read my fortune on the matter of... my love life.
Qiming: Love life... again? This must be the tenth time this month...
Zhihua: I only keep coming because your predictions are so accurate! Especially that one thing that you keep telling me, "Being preoccupied with the outcome of a divination is not conducive to finding true love."
Zhihua: That's why from now on, my focus will be solely on the divination itself, not the outcome.
Qiming: I see. Well, let me try to explain this differently...
Qiming: True love may be impossibly far away, or it may be right under your nose. You cannot force it. But when its day comes, it will reveal itself to you right before your very eyes... and who knows, maybe today will be that day.
Zhihua: Aha! I understand. I understand it now!
Qiming: Pray tell what you presume to have understood...
Zhihua: You DO feel the same way! From this day forth I will live solely to bring you happiness. Will you marry me!?
Qiming: ...No thank you.
Zhihua: Well, are you free tonight?
Qiming: No. And now I'm calling the guards.

Traveler: Could you please tell me my fortune?
Qiming: So you want to know your horoscope for the day? Well then, go ahead, take a fortune. But no returns, mind you, even if you pull an unlucky one!

## Talk 6

Qiming: You again... Here to have your fortune told?
Zhihua: Madam Qiming, is it not a fine day today? I propose that we—
Qiming: This day is indeed an auspicious one. All is in order in Heaven and Earth, and destiny is smiling down.
Zhihua: I'm glad you agree! In which case, Qiming, what say you we—
Qiming: Do you want your fortune told, or not? Let me guess — love life again this time?
Zhihua: O—Okay, erm, yes; let's get the latest on my love life. And then, I should like for you to go with me to the Mingxiao Lantern site—
Qiming: I'm afraid your fortunes are looking dire today in matters of love. To be clear, even if you waited till the sea ran dry, or ventured to the ends of the earth... all your efforts would ultimately prove futile.
Zhihua: Ugh... You could have phrased it more gently, perhaps...
Qiming: Okay, time's up. Please pay and move out of the way for the next customer. Thank you!
