# That Green Fellow

Green Fellow: Wait, you guys are...
Green Fellow: Oh, that's right! You're the ones that scared Dvalin away.
Paimon: Dvalin? Who's that?
Traveler: That's Stormterror's real name.
Paimon: Huh? ...Oh, right. Most people seem to call him "Stormterror."
Paimon: Why do you call him that... are you two meant to be close or something?
Green Fellow: Oh, so close...
Paimon: #Hey, Traveler. Paimon thinks this guy has a screw loose...
Traveler: Ahh... hi.
Green Fellow: Good day, outlander. Seems we meet again.
Venti: I'm Venti the bard.
Venti: Three-time winner of the "Most Popular Bard of Mondstadt," to be precise.
Venti: So, what do you need from me?
Paimon: Given you recognize us, Paimon doesn't believe we need to explain any further.
Paimon: Of course it's about Stormterror.
Venti: Storm...?
Paimon: Hey! Cut it with the amnesia act!
Paimon: #Traveler, show it to him.
Venti: Oh! Isn't this—
Paimon: What!? The crystal has been purified!? When?
Traveler: Not sure how this happened.
Venti: Dvalin, he...
Venti: The anguish he feels... has brought him to tears...
Paimon: Tears...?
Traveler: The last time I checked, it was full of impurities.
Traveler: I'm sorry, you are...?
Traveler: Lisa told us already, weren't you listening?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Paimon: Ehhhh!?
Venti: You... really do have some wonderful abilities...
Venti: Someone like you is going to end up getting written into a bard's poem.
Venti: #Oh, a hero so bright, should he stand in the light. Though stand in the shade, and you'll be met by a blade...
Venti: Alas... I've really not the time to compose a melody for you at this moment.
Venti: Anyway, even if Dvalin is not taken down, his life will still wither away in the breeze...
Traveler: I also feel sorry for Dvalin.
Traveler: Is there anything I can do to help?
Traveler: As a knight, I suggest you turn yourself in along with the dragon.
Venti: He'll burn himself out in the flames of anger...
Venti: Thank you for that, and you for purifying the Teardrop Crystal.
Venti: But I have my own plans for what is to follow.
Venti: I really must thank you for purifying the Teardrop Crystal, it has helped me greatly.
Venti: But I've already come to devise my own plan.
Venti: Do you really deem that necessary?
Venti: You can forget about me turning us in for now... I have another plan.
Paimon: Oh? And what plan would that be?
Venti: Seeing this tear has brought to mind a friend so dear.
Paimon: Friend?
Venti: Heh-heh, one must be going.
Paimon: Hey! Where're you running off to!?
Venti: To the "Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero." Bye-bye~
Traveler: This "weirdo" as you put it — we need to keep an eye on him...
Paimon: #Huh... Traveler, what do you make of that?
Traveler: You know...
Paimon: As far as he's concerned, you're a weirdo too ya know...
Traveler: His voice seems familiar...
Paimon: Know what?
