Traveler: How's the war going at the moment?
Matsudaira: Well, about that... We've fought them so many times. Though they are inferior to the Shogunate army in terms of manpower and equipment, they are still relentless and are putting up a desperate fight.
Matsudaira: As for what we should do next exactly, we should probably follow the orders of the higher-ups. You can't just fight and kill all the time. Regrouping and recreation are also necessary aspects of war.
Matsudaira: Don't get the wrong idea. I'm not saying that because I'm afraid of them.
Matsudaira: All wars have their casualties. Even though we're on the winning side, there will still be unseen scars left on people.
Matsudaira: For a commoner like you, it's best that you stay far away from this hellhole.
