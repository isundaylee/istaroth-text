# Echoes of Life


## Talk 1

Paimon: We're back! We found Kachina's Ancient Name, too!
Traveler: What happened at the Stadium?
Mavuika: Well... It's fairly complicated. Let me give you the condensed version.
Black Screen Text: You learn of the Pyro Archon's battle against The Captain, as well as her sacrifice.
Paimon: The Fatui again! We can't go anywhere without them causing trouble!
Mualani: But, what if the Fatui finds out you've lost your power? Won't they try to take advantage of the situation?
Mavuika: Haha, that's why it has to be our little secret. No one else can know, or we're asking for trouble.
Mavuika: Look, I wish I could offer you some sort of consolation, but I won't lie to you — with multiple factions closing in, there's nothing comforting about the situation we're facing.
Mavuika: Still, all you need to do is to focus on your goal. You can leave the complicated matters to me.
Iansan: I can also step in on the Pyro Archon's behalf. There's a limit to what I can accomplish, but I'll help you however I can...
Mavuika: Hahaha, there's no need to be so modest, Iansan. Your incredible strength has long been a well-known fact. You're the pride of your tribe.
Mualani: Archon, I... I'm sorry about before. You have so much on your plate, so much that you have to worry about, but all I could do was focus on my own feelings.
Mavuika: You have nothing to be sorry about. We all get overwhelmed by our emotions, myself included. Your reaction to Kachina's disappearance — I understand that feeling very well.
Mavuika: Well, now that we have Kachina's Ancient Name, let's go track her down. Follow me.

## Talk 2

Mavuika: The powder still needs some time to settle, so let's wait a little longer.
Mavuika: Well, what do you think of my collection? Do you feel like you have a better understanding of Natlan's culture now?
Paimon: Yeah! If each item represents a different story, seems like Natlan's really been through a lot.
Paimon: Does every item hold a special memory, just like Atea's talisman?
Mavuika: That's right. The items in my collection actually serve a similar purpose to the Ancient Names passed down among the tribes.
Mavuika: They demonstrate the true shape of time.
Paimon: The shape of... time?
Mavuika: Most people perceive time as a linear concept, almost like a straight line that can only move forward. We cannot change the past or predict the future.
Mavuika: But, there's also a different theory, one that I believe to be closer to the truth. Namely, that the "past," "present," and "future" all exist at once.
Paimon: A—At once? Paimon's not sure she understands...
Mavuika: Let's say your journey ended right now. Thinking back on your experience in each nation, which one would you say was the most important?
Traveler: I'd have to say all of them.
Mavuika: Exactly. Even at the end of your journey, the things you experienced along the way don't cease to exist. They become part of who you are.
Mavuika: Take out a portion of that journey, and you would likely make very different decisions, and eventually arrive at a very different destination.
Mavuika: The future is the same way. It exists even though it has yet to come to pass. We just lack the means to perceive it.
Mavuika: Of course, there are those with the power to foresee the future. They simply call it by a different name — "fate." You're quite familiar with that concept, I would imagine...
Paimon: That does kinda make sense! The future hasn't happened, but it already exists...
Mavuika: Humanity excels at living in the present, but too often, we forget the past and neglect the future.
Traveler: So, Ancient Names record the past...
Mavuika: While the Pilgrimage and the Night Warden Wars lead us to a better future.
Mavuika: Only by uniting the people of Natlan across countless eras can we fight back against an enemy as formidable as the Abyss.
Mavuika: To come up with such a set of rules, the first Pyro Archon must have possessed a level of insight I can only imagine.
Traveler: So, the first Pyro Archon created the "rules" of Natlan?
Mavuika: That's correct. At first, he was a mortal man with no special power. After he ascended to the divine throne, he used it to borrow power from the heav{RUBY#[D]Ronova}ens and establish the rules of Natlan.
Mavuika: Namely, a framework through which ordinary people can ascend to archonhood.
Mavuika: By holding the Pilgrimage, we're able to determine the strongest among us, and when that person ascends to the divine throne, their inner flame will awaken.
Mavuika: In addition, the Sacred Flame will grant them significant knowledge and memory of this land. After all, that's how I came to know everything I just told you.
Paimon: So, it all comes down to the power of the divine throne and the rules...
Paimon: Wait, is that... a family portrait?
Mavuika: Ah, yes. That's my mother, father, younger sister, and the little Saurians we raised.
Mavuika: I turned a piece of my dad's leather armor into a canvas, and commissioned a famous artist to paint our likeness.
Paimon: Your sister is so cute! Looks like you two are really close!
Paimon: Paimon was having a hard time thinking of an Archon as an ordinary person, but seeing this portrait... it kinda makes sense now.
Paimon: It really doesn't look like there was anything special about you before... Oh, wait, is Paimon allowed to say that?
Mavuika: A little late for that question, don't you think?
Paimon: Sorry! Paimon's so sorry! Paimon's mouth works faster than her brain, sometimes.
Mavuika: Hahaha, it's alright. I'd never get upset over something like that.
Mavuika: No matter what others may say, my past is a precious part of my identity. I'm forever proud of the life I used to lead.
Mavuika: Becoming the Archon doesn't mean you sever ties with your family. The position just comes with a lot of responsibilities, so it impacts how often you get to see them.
Mavuika: My father made the most delicious stew, so my sister would often bring me a large pot of his cooking, and we would sit on a blanket and eat it together.
Mavuika: One time, we didn't close the door securely, and the Saurians we were raising ran into the room and knocked over the entire pot.
Mavuika: My sister immediately burst into tears. The two troublemakers were going for the meat, but when they saw my sister's distress, they froze on the spot.
Mavuika: I still remember the way they laid there, sulking like a pair of children even after making such a mess. It was frustrating, but in the end, all I could do was comfort my sister and move on.
Paimon: Wow...
Traveler: You forgave them just like that?
Mavuika: Isn't that what being a family is all about? Hahaha, I think about that story a lot, actually.
Mavuika: As the Archon, I made a vow to defend this nation, and experiences like that... they remind me exactly what I'm trying to protect.
Paimon: Well, what happened after that? This portrait looks pretty old. Your sister must be all grown up by now, right?
Mavuika: I believe she ended up working as an architect and artist. She built many houses, and crafted many beautiful works of art...
Mavuika: Anyway, that's enough about me... Now that the powder has settled, we can begin. Iansan, Mualani, Chasca, over here, please.
Mavuika: Place the Ancient Name up there, and then we'll begin.

## Talk 3

Paimon: This is Atea's talisman.
Mavuika: I'm sure you're familiar with this one already. Atea was rarely ever without it. The talisman brought her a lot of luck in battle.

## Talk 4

Paimon: So we're underneath Natlan right now? It looks nothing like Paimon was imagining!
Chasca: That's because in the distant past, Natlan was home to an incredibly advanced civilization ruled by dragons.
Chasca: Humans only established their own society after the fall of the dragons.
Paimon: So these are... Saurian ruins?
Traveler: I don't think she's talking about the Saurians...
Paimon: Wait, you mean like the elemental sovereigns? They had their own advanced civilization!?
Iansan: Yes... a really long time ago. Very few records have survived until now, so no one really knows what the devices here are for.
Iansan: These ruins have been abandoned for a long time, but with the recent increase in Abyss activity, the installations around here have somehow been activated again.
Mualani: So what you're saying is... We're not in for an easy trip to the Night Kingdom.
Chasca: No, it's going to be obstacle after obstacle from here on out.
Chasca: Hehe.
Traveler: Just what I wanted to hear.
Paimon: Um, why are you all laughing like that? It's creeping Paimon out...
Iansan: It's the pre-adventure excitement kicking in! Right, guys?
Chasca: Of course. I'm eager to get started.
Traveler: Adventurers live for moments like these.
Mualani: Then let's go! We won't let anything stand in our way!
Traveler: I think she means actual dragons.

## Talk 5

Mualani: This must be the entrance the Pyro Archon told us about... The one ripped open by the Abyss.
Chasca: Yes, there's something in the depths of this place that feels familiar yet also foreign.
Paimon: We actually have to go in there?
Paimon: Okay, Paimon just needs to psych herself up. Don't push her through before she's ready!
