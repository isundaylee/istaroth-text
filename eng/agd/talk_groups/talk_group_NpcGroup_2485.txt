Hanqian: Hah... Training is the only way to pack more power behind that punch! Gotta keep going!

Traveler: Who are you?
Hanqian: I'm one of the leaders of the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency. As it stands now, you can think of me as half an owner.
Hanqian: Let me tell you... There used to be three of us leaders, and we were all very good.
Hanqian: At our peak, we were in charge of almost half of the orders here in Yilong Wharf.
Hanqian: After we started working with the Communications Office, the best leader among the three of us lost his drive, and just hung around all day.
Hanqian: He used to be the kind of guy who would train under a waterfall to discipline himself. I can't for the life of me figure out what happened.
Hanqian: Another was ambushed by bandits and took almost a full year to recover. He's no longer as good as he was, so I'm the only one left.
Hanqian: The owner saw what happened and decided to just go hands-off on us.
Hanqian: We'll just have to wait until the newly recruited guards for hire are ready and see if things improve.
Hanqian: Speaking of which... Dip Yeuk isn't slacking off, is he? And I wonder how Huang the Third is doing.
Hanqian: *sigh* I do spend my days just worrying about things, don't I?

Traveler: About training methodologies...
Hanqian: You don't look like some Millelith elite. An adventurer, then?
Hanqian: If you ask me, we, the Millelith troops, and adventurers face different challenges, so our training programs emphasize different things.
Hanqian: For a guard, everything is about stamina. Endurance and weight training are extremely important.
Hanqian: You can ask Gaming about it if you'd like.
Hanqian: He's not the most muscular one, but his stamina, strength, and explosive power are second to none.
Hanqian: Maybe it's because he often practices Wushou Dance, which requires precise movements and core strength to get through any given show.
Hanqian: But I can't train like him, so I improve my stamina in the most basic way possible.

Traveler: Bye, I'm off to train too!

Traveler: What are the recruiting standards for guards?
Hanqian: Good question.
Hanqian: You must be agile, patient, good with directions, observant, and have a quick mind. These are all necessary qualities.
Hanqian: You need them to defeat bandits and monsters while on a job, so you can escort whatever you're delivering to the destination safely.
Hanqian: Most importantly, and many ignore this, you need to have chivalry.
Hanqian: You must not be tempted by money. There was once a real scumbag who colluded with the bandits during a job and seized the goods.
Hanqian: Many guards went after him as a result, handing him his sorry arse before handing him over to the Millelith.
Hanqian: The stuff he stole? Returned, and he was forced to pay all he had as compensation — on top of spending the rest of his life in prison.
Hanqian: Anyway, I digress. You must be chivalrous and righteous.
