# Destined Encounter


## Talk 1

Paimon: Kaeya should be at Djafar Tavern right now. Let's go see him!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Huh, so there really isn't anyone home... *cough* Ugh, this place is so dusty! Paimon bets no one's lived here in years!
Dainsleif: Investigate carefully. We mustn't miss a single detail.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Monsters! Wow, Dain's ears are sharp, just like his nose. He's in surprisingly good shape for a 500-year-old...
Paimon: Hmm, although for someone who's as full of surprises as Dain, it's hardly a big deal... Anyway, let's beat up these monsters!

## Talk 4

Kaeya: Oho? What a coincidence, I just finished my talks with the Sumeru merchant. Didn't expect to bump into you again.
Kaeya: Shall we head back to the tavern for a drink? I'd like to chat with you about what happened during last year's Windblume Festival. Now that was really...
Kaeya: ...Ah, I see you have other things to do with your time. Busy as ever, hmm? Alright then, remember to come see me at the Angel's Share when next you're in Mondstadt. Safe travels.

## Talk 5

Paimon: This bed looks pretty ordinary. Huh, there's nothing underneath it, either.
Paimon: What sort of person would wanna live here? It's so dark and damp... Can't be all that comfortable...

## Talk 6

Dainsleif: I doubt that the appearance of those monsters was wholly random. There must be something nearby that attracted them.
Dainsleif: A Ley Line anomaly, perhaps? ...Hmm, but it seems to be more than that.
Dainsleif: Okay — I'll go slightly further out to investigate any issues with the nearby Ley Lines. I might be a while. You should wait for me here.
Paimon: What? You're going alone? You'd better not be trying to keep some secret from us!
Dainsleif: ...Your suspicions are as banal as they are unwarranted. I merely think that this house should remain the focus of our investigation, and as such, someone ought to stay here and keep an eye on it.
Dainsleif: Not to mention that if even Forest Rangers are capable of investigating Ley Lines, I will be more than able to handle it alone.
Paimon: Ugh, fair enough. Guess we'll just camp out here, then?
Paimon: Good thing there's a bonfire over there. Let's make ourselves something to eat! All this running around has made Paimon real hungry.

## Talk 7

Black Screen Text: You and Paimon make a fire, and before you know it, night sets in.
Paimon: Ahh, your cooking is as good as ever! Even if there was no other reason, the food alone would be enough for Paimon to stick with you, hee-hee!
Traveler: Well, freeloading comes more naturally to you than most...
Paimon: Changing the subject, Dain's taking forever! He said that there might be an issue with the nearby Ley Lines... How bad do you think it could be?
Paimon: *sigh* We came together, but now it's back to just being the two of us again... Y'know, now that Paimon mentions it, we really have spent lots and lots of time together, haven't we?
Paimon: Um, so... don't take this the wrong way or anything, but, uh... d—do you ever get tired of Paimon being around?
Traveler: You make my day every day, Paimon.
Paimon: ...Aww, oh you, stop it! Now you're embarrassing Paimon...
Paimon: #Hmm... So, um, next question... Don't know if it's okay to ask this, but Paimon's curious: What was it like traveling with your {M#sister}{F#brother}?
Traveler: ...
Paimon: The stars?
Traveler: We'd gaze at the stars, just like this.
Paimon: Wow...
Traveler: We traveled through the universe, always by each other's side...
Traveler: This is the first time we've ever been separated.
Paimon: Yeah... Paimon understands. Being separated without even knowing the reason why... it's just terrible.
Paimon: But we'll find the truth together, sure as Paimon's your guide! Just you wait, Heavenly Principles! And you too, Teyvat!
Traveler: Just you wait, Heavenly Principles!
Paimon: Uh... Y'know what? We've talked too long about this sad stuff. Let's talk about something happy instead! 'Cause if you're sad... Paimon will be too.
Traveler: Don't worry about it, Paimon.
Paimon: Alright, alright. It's getting dark, so why don't you rest? Paimon will take first watch. Don't worry, no monster's gonna come and eat you up!
Traveler: Well, that's a first. Paimon, not going to bed before me?
Paimon: Oh, come on, don't say that... Paimon just wants to look after you for once.
Traveler: Alright.
Paimon: Nighty-night! Go on, shoo, off to sleep!
Traveler: Goodnight then, Paimon.
Traveler: Thank you, Paimon.
Traveler: And you too, Teyvat!
Traveler: If nothing else... I just want to know what happened.
Traveler: We saw all manner of hope and despair.
Traveler: And we'd point at the planets we wanted to visit.
Traveler: Not really. You're better than nothing, I guess.
Paimon: Hmph, okay, fine. Paimon shoulda known you weren't gonna say anything nice.
Traveler: You're easy to please.

## Talk 8

Dainsleif: Hey, time to wake up. The sun has risen.
Traveler: (...)
Traveler: (...Dain?)
Dainsleif: What a deep sleeper. You do know that we need to...
Dainsleif: Hmm? Tear stains... You dreamed of your sibling last night, didn't you?
Dainsleif: ...Alright. Rest here a bit longer then. I'll head into the forest to investigate.
Traveler: (Huh? Why're you going back into the forest...)
Traveler: *yawn*...
Traveler: (Hmm? How did I sleep till morning? Why didn't Paimon wake me up to switch shifts? ... Hang on a moment... Where IS Paimon, anyway?)
Traveler: (Ah, I vaguely remember Dain coming over. Did Paimon go into the woods with him, seeing how I hadn't woken up yet?)
Traveler: (Whatever the case, looks like it's just me here for now. Guess it's time to stretch my limbs and have a look around.)
Traveler: (Clatter...)
Traveler: (Wait, did that noise come from... inside the house?)
Traveler: Paimon, is that you?
Traveler: (No reply... I should go inside and check.)
Traveler: Paimon, this isn't the time for hide-and-seek...

## Talk 9

Dainsleif: Wait... This place, it's... familiar.
Paimon: What about it? It looks pretty normal to Paimon... Was it like this hundreds of years ago, too?
Dainsleif: Yes. The forest has barely changed from how I remember it. There is very little human activity here, after all.
Dainsleif: Let's search the area and see what we can find.
Paimon: Is this a field? It must belong to whoever owns that house over there...
Paimon: But it looks like it's been abandoned for a long time. You could be forgiven for thinking nothing was ever grown here... Or wait, maybe nothing ever WAS grown here.
Paimon: It's an extinguished bonfire. Forest Rangers, perhaps?
Paimon: Looks like it's been ages since it was last lit. And clearly they put it out carefully to prevent a forest fire, too. That's responsible.
Dainsleif: Nothing else stands out in this area. All that's left is that building. Come on.
Paimon: Wait, we're just gonna go barging in? What if someone's home?
Dainsleif: Unlikely. There are no signs of life in this area. We should be able to enter without incident.
Paimon: If you say so... Well, uh... you lead the way then, Dain. Hehe...

## Talk 10

Paimon: Hey look, it's a bowl. Guess whoever used to live here liked to cook, huh?
Dainsleif: Can't you smell it? There's a heavy scent of medicinal herbs in here.
Paimon: Ohh, so it's a medicine bowl? ...*sniff* Hmm, seems you're right! You've got a good nose on you, Dain!

## Talk 11

Paimon: Doesn't look like there's anything else worth our attention here. You sure we're in the right place, Dain?
Dainsleif: My memories are quite foggy, but my subconscious and instincts both assert that something once happened here.
Dainsleif: But, we'll exhaust ourselves if we search aimlessly... I hear noises outside. Let's go and check.
Paimon: Noises? Is it...
Dainsleif: It's not much. Just some minor adversaries.

## Talk 12

Paimon: There's a box over here. Why don't we open it? Uh, and by "we," Paimon means you... Paimon's just scared that... whatever's inside might bite her fingertips off...
Traveler: What in the world is going through your head...
Paimon: Huh? This is... a mirror.
Paimon: It's broken, too. Was this a makeup box?
Traveler: It's just a regular mirror.
Paimon: Hmm. That's kinda... disappointing. Paimon was hoping we'd uncover some super big secret, especially after Dain talked this place up.
Traveler: It's just broken.
Traveler: You sure are going places with your paranoia...
