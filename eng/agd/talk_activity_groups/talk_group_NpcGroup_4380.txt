Traveler: Who are you...
Hunayn: I came to borrow some books. I've been applying for additional permits to borrow more books.
Hunayn: I've read almost everything on general knowledge that I can borrow from here. Hope my mentor can give me access to other books soon.

Traveler: Do you have any recommended reads?
Hunayn: It depends on which Darshan and subject you're interested in.
Hunayn: I can give you a list based on that.
Hunayn: But only researchers and students at the Akademiya can borrow books from the House of Daena, so you will need a permit.
