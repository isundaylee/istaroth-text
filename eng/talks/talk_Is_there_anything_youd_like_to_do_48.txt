Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Rosaria: Hmm... let's go to the tavern.
Rosaria: We'll drink to our hearts' delight, and who cares if we get drunk?
Traveler: You actually get drunk?
Rosaria: ...I've never allowed myself to get drunk.
Rosaria: I used to think it was idiotic to leave yourself vulnerable in front of others.
Rosaria: But my perspective on that has changed.
Rosaria: Huh... Maybe it's because I trust you... but that's beside the point.
Rosaria: Angel's Share or The Cat's Tail, which one you wanna go to?
Traveler: Angel's Share.
Rosaria: If it's from Dawn Winery, you can be absolutely assured of its quality.
Rosaria: I'd recommend their Dandelion Wine.
Rosaria: You'll throw back a couple of drinks with me, won't you?
Traveler: ...
Rosaria: ...
Rosaria: Never mind, I'll drink for you.
Rosaria: Just return the favor when you're of age.
Traveler: The Cat's Tail.
Rosaria: Oh? Interested in their special cocktails, are you?
Rosaria: Their bartender doesn't work every day, but we can try our luck.
Traveler: I can't imagine you being drunk.
