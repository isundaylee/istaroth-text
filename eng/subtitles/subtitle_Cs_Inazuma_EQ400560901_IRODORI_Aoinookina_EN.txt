That figure was none other than Aoi no Okina himself
This turn of events had begun with an unnamed individual
Under whose coercion Aoi no Okina was forced
To take drastic measures to retrieve a page of poetry
He knew nothing
Of this individual's true intentions
All he knew was that
The poem had to do with an old acquaintance, Akahito
