Jingming: Hello, how may I help you?
Traveler: Please tell me about Xiao Lanterns...
Jingming: Xiao Lantern-making is a traditional craft form at Lantern Rite. It's quite technical, you need to cut the paper, insert the wick, add wish sticks, paint it...
Jingming: Sounds like quite an ordeal, huh? Fortunately, if you know how to use a Crafting Bench, it makes things much easier these days.
Jingming: Hopefully, the gods don't think that cheapens the wishes we make.
Jingming: The Crafting Bench is over there. Why not give it a try? The Lantern Rite only comes once a year.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Jingming: May the flames of wisdom spread to all, and never be extinguished.
