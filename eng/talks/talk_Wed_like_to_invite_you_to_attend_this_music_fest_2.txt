Traveler: *We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.*
Jifang: A music festival, you say? You know, I actually met my husband because of a song. Quite the coincidence, eh?
Paimon: Ooh! Which song was it? Bet we can play it for you â€” we're super serious about music!
Jifang: Oh, in that case, could you play it if I were to hum the tune?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Jifang: Haha, how exciting!
