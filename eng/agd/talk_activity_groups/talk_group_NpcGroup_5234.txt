Traveler: I haven't done anything wrong.
"Intrepid Valberry": Ha! Done nothing wrong... I know you young'uns all like to save face.
"Intrepid Valberry": Eh, forget it. I won't ask. Though it seems we're somewhat bound together by fate, so if anyone gives you any trouble, you come tell me, and I'll help you out.

Traveler: What orange Bulle Fruit?
"Intrepid Valberry": I used to have a buddy who really liked Bulle Fruit, and recently I saw that someone had drawn one on the noticeboard. It made me miss him all of a sudden.
"Intrepid Valberry": Never mind. Poor guy's probably long since left this world. Forget it. Remember to treasure those around you, eh?

Traveler: Bye.
"Intrepid Valberry": Don't be as arrogant here as you are out there. That's my advice.
