Urville: I feel like I've gotten a little stronger recently. Let's go diving for treasure again when things are less busy at the harbor.
Nadia: Alright, if we're chased by any Ball Octopuses again, I'll take the responsibility and bring Urville back.
Urville: Can't you have a little faith in me? Why is it assumed from the get-go that I'm going to lose?
Nadia: Well... I don't remember the exact score, but I know you have lost to the Ball Octopuses more than a few times before. Not exactly a track record that fills you with confidence.
Urville: Darn it, we should still have hope, no matter what! What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger, right?
Nadia: You are right. As long as we persevere, there will always be a chance of success.
