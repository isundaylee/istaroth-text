# Old Tastes Die Hard


## Talk 1

Mr. Zhu: If only I could eat it again, it was so good...
Traveler: Eat what again?
Mr. Zhu: Oh, a traveler. When I was young I used to travel all over the place. What I loved most about traveling was getting to try all the different foods.
Mr. Zhu: After eating my way across the continent, I returned to Liyue and opened my restaurant, Emerald Maple, in the hopes I could recreate the flavors of my travels.
Mr. Zhu: But there's this one dish I can never quite remember the name of.

## Talk 2

Mr. Zhu: You're back! Did you find the mystery dish?
Traveler: Yes.
Mr. Zhu: Great! Give it here...
Traveler: Not yet.
Mr. Zhu: No problem. Take your time with the search... But please don't forget about it.

## Talk 3

Mr. Zhu: Thank you ever so much! Please take this for your trouble, traveler.
