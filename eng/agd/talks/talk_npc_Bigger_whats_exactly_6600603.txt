Traveler: Bigger whats... exactly?
Cintli: Grainfruit, Tomatoes, Sunsettias, Onions... You name it, we grow it.
Cintli: Did you know that I'm currently the producer of Natlan's biggest Grainfruit?
Cintli: But I haven't reached my limit yet, not by a long shot. I'm certain that my land has far more potential.
Cintli: I've decided that once I've grown even bigger fruits, I'll display them in Yantasar's store for all to see.
Cintli: As people taste the delicious drinks she makes from the fruit and veg I grow, they'll be able to see how big and beautiful they are with their own two eyes.
Cintli: Then my store's reputation will start booming too, haha!
