Traveler: Is there something special about mushrooms from Sumeru?
Zhonglin: Oh... I'm not really the right person to ask. I'm no expert in plants.
Zhonglin: They don't look much different on the outside... Maybe they have a unique taste or something?
Zhonglin: How about this: You take this one back with you and put it in your next dish. If the dish turns out well, put in a good word for me with all your acquaintances! Hahaha...
