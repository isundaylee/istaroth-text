Traveler: Vishaps?
Jinghe: Oh, you can't call them Geovishaps. They're called "Tepetlisaurs."
Jinghe: You see this little one over here? The jeweler over there introduced him to me. His name is Nini. Cute, eh?
Jinghe: Natlan's a really cool place. Everyone here is super friendly, and even the Saurians here won't roll over and headbutt you just because you stepped into their territory. Maybe I'll consider extending my trip...
Jinghe: Still, I've heard that not all the Saurians here are friendly. I haven't met any other types of Saurians yet, so I'm looking forward to it.
