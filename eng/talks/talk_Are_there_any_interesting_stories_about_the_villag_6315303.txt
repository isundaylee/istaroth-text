Traveler: Are there any interesting stories about the village?
Futaba: Hmm... Interesting stories... Ah, I've got one! It's said that there are bad things that appear in some scary house around here. I've always wanted to go and it see for myself.
Futaba: Takeru promised to come with me, but his legs got all wobbly when the house got in sight! What a scaredy-cat!
Futaba: If you ask me, I think there must be Tatarigami living in there! They're the scariest type of ghosts! They mess with people's minds and make them go insane.
Futaba: Why don't I go myself? Erm... I already told you, Tatarigami are super scary! It would make more sense to bring someone with me, it'd be dumb to go alone.
