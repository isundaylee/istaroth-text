Kuroyume: Impossible... With just one person's dream, you... But how? ...I have been planning this for so long...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Once the false dream he created has been destroyed, I can make sure all his victims make a full recovery.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I don't think I ever would have been able to do this without your help...
Paimon: Hehe, don't mention it!
Kuroyume: Hmph... You shall join my ancestors in death... You, and my failure of a host...
Paimon: What? He's still not dead!? ...Wait, does anyone else hear water? Where is that coming from?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Maybe he made his host build some kind of device in the underwater cave? Once he realized we were onto him, he decided to sacrifice his host...
Paimon: So you mean... we're in danger in the real world too!?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: We've got to wake up!
Paimon: But how? Like... pinch ourselves?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: #This should be high enough... Traveler, Paimon, jump!
Paimon: Huh!?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: If you're afraid, then just take my hand, and close your eyes.
Traveler: I assume I'm not allowed to open them again until you say so?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Yes â€” just like the last time!
