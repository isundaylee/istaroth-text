Traveler: About your mentor...
Jami: My mentor's just awful! I've made up my mind. If I get to finish my research in time, I shall stand on his desk and slap him with my draft manuscript!
Jami: Or so I wish... I am grateful to him, though. He's been strict, yes. But it's for our own good. I know that much.
