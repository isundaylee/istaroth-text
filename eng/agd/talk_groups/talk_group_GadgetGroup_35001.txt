Unknown Role (None): You sure you don't want to go with us?
Scylla: I fear that I shall be of little help. Come back once you have defeated that traitor.
Scylla: When that time comes, perhaps I too shall be able to amend my past regrets.

Unknown Role (None): I need your help...

Unknown Role (None): We're good.
Scylla: Indeed. Come see me once you have vanquished that traitor.

## Talk

Unknown Role (None): How are you doing, big guy?
Scylla: I must thank you for defeating that demon and allowing the remaining souls to transcend. These deep waters are far more tranquil now.
Scylla: Still, the dearth of those strange noises makes sleep a more tempting prospect, haha!
