# Strange Stone Chronicle


## Talk 1

Paimon: Puca, we're back!
Puca: #Traveler and Paimon! Are you here to play with me?
Paimon: Um, not really! You told us that we could ask you anything related to ore veins and gemstones, right?
Puca: Yep! I've collected all the pretty stones around the area. What exactly do you wanna ask about?
Paimon: It's about that stone we found last time...
Black Screen Text: You tell Puca about how you sold the strange ore to the gemstone merchant...
Puca: Huh? People outside really thought that it was a precious gemstone? But I've even shown it to my sister before... Humans really are hard to understand...
Puca: But I know a lot of places with stones like this! If you want, I'll show you where they are.
Black Screen Text: Puca marks the locations of the strange ore on your map.
Paimon: That'll be great. Thanks, Puca! Oh, right, here's the Mora that Chesil paid us as an advance fee. We could give you half, y'know!
Puca: Oh, it's alright. We don't really need anything like that in the village, anyway... not to mention how you've helped me so much, too!

## Talk 2

Chesil: Welcome... Oh hey, it's you!
Chesil: Do you have the ore you agreed to bring?
Traveler: Not yet.
Chesil: Well, the craftsmen are still processing the previous sample, so it's not too urgent...
Chesil: But if we managed to get our hands on more supplies, the craftsmen might just become newly inspired, eh?
Chesil: I'll still be here waiting for your good news.

## Talk 3

Chesil: Welcome! We meet again.
Chesil: The ore you brought last time is still being processed at the moment, so I cannot show you the finished product yet. I'm afraid you must wait a bit longer...

## Talk 4

Chesil: Whoa, you found so much... This is an enormous help!
Chesil: I already sent the ore to the workshop, but I still haven't received my sample product yet. It could be because the artisans aren't familiar with working a gem of this kind and ran into some trouble...
Chesil: But worry not! I trust my judgment.
Chesil: I'm planning to turn them into accessories that'll no doubt become the newest craze all across Fontaine.
Chesil: You'll see what the final product looks like the next time you visit! I'll give you some samples as a gift when the time comes.
Chesil: Or perhaps... you might see the most fashionable of the nobility wearing them before you even arrive, haha.
Chesil: Alright then, you're always welcome to come back another time.

## Talk 5

Chesil: Welcome... Oh hey, it's you! My gemstone suppliers...
Paimon: Yup! We brought lots of that ore, as promised!
