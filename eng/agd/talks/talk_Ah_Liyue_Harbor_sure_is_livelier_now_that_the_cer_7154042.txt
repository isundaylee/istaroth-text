Kun: Ah, Liyue Harbor sure is livelier now that the ceremony's over.
Kun: I heard some gossip that the start of this year was an unlucky time, which had something to do with many people falling ill. Even had me feeling nervous back there.

Kun: I've heard that the ceremony this time was a most important one, requiring in-person attention from skilled adepts of many different specialties. So forget a normal year, the one to come's going to be a blast for sure!
