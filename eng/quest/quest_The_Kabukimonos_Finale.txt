# The Kabukimono's Finale


## Talk 1

Aqaba: Hey! It's them!
Paimon: Aqaba, Sawada! You're still here?
Traveler: Are you still talking about the... "essay"?
Sawada: Indeed we are! If you have a moment, we'd love for you to join us once more.
Paimon: We have time. What do you wanna talk to us about?
Sawada: The same topic we discussed last time... obviously.
Paimon: Still looking for more info about Tatarasuna, huh? Hmm, should we join them?
Traveler: (Perfect. These two have researched Tatarasuna's past. Let's hear what they have to say.)
Aqaba: Unfortunately, we haven't made any real progress...
Traveler: The article that you let me read last time was great.
Aqaba: Huh? Oh, uh, of course.
Sawada: I presume you'll want to read mine as well? Here.
Traveler: (...)
Traveler: (The content has changed. Another effect of tampering with the information in Irminsul.)
Traveler: (The Balladeer said he'd erase two of his names. If he really succeeded, it must have taken all of his might... But still...)
Aqaba: Well, what do you think?
Traveler: A masterpiece!
Paimon: #Hey Traveler, remember how last time Aqaba was saying how he wished they could gather more information about all this? Well, we just got back from Inazuma, so how about we tell them what we learned?
Traveler: Sure.
Aqaba: What did you find out? Something big?
Paimon: It's a long story. Basically, we have some friends in Inazuma, and...
Black Screen Text: You tell the two writers what you learned about the Raiden Gokaden and Tatarasuna's history...
Aqaba: Wow! So many new details... Thank you so much for sharing that with us!
Sawada: Well, well, so it all comes down to one man's desire for revenge... Huh. You heard this from a member of the Amenoma Clan, you say? Then I guess it must be true.
Sawada: *sigh* So there's no ghost story here after all...
Aqaba: This new information actually lends further credence to my hypothesis â€” evidently, swordsmiths were seen as having an incredibly prestigious role in society in those days, to the extent that harming them was conceived of, at least by the perpetrator, as a way of exacting revenge against those in power...
Sawada: Yes, yes, okay, point taken. You were right, but that doesn't mean I can't carry on with my novel...
Paimon: Aaand they're back at it. These guys are really into this.
Traveler: We've got some things to take care of. Bye for now.
Aqaba: Oh, so sorry, look at us, prattling on about our projects and ignoring you. Thank you so much for the information.
Paimon: You're welcome. See ya!
Sawada: Keep us in the loop if you find out anything else!
Paimon: Will do!
Traveler: Can I read it again?

## Talk 2

Paimon: Let's go get a snack from one of the stalls in the Grand Bazaar. That'll be sure to lift our spirits!
Paimon: It must be really tough being the only one who remembers all that... But Paimon's always here to help cheer you up.

## Talk 3

Nahida: There once was a lone monster draped in fox fur. The monster found a family of foxes, joined them, and they became friends. The monster lived with the family, day and night, and everyone treated it as one of their own.
Nahida: Once in a while, the monster would take off its fox fur at night, and lament to itself as it gazed at its reflection in the water: "I am a monstrosity, yet they are too foolish to see it... I pity them."
Nahida: But the monster soon found solace when another came to live among the foxes who was not their kin: a kitten, carved from the wood of a white tree, who had been abandoned by the humans.
Nahida: The kitten, too, wished to become a fox, but its tail was too slender and it could not grow a coat of richly colored fur. Yet when the other foxes saw this, they spoke words of comfort to the kitten: "Even without a tail and fur like ours, you are still one of us."
Nahida: Furious at this happy resolution, the monster lit a fire on the mountain. The terrified animals panicked as the fire spread. The only way to extinguish the flames was to make a sacrifice.
Nahida: A gray fox stood up and addressed the monster. It said: "You are the cleverest among us. Surely you can help us find a way to solve this."
Nahida: The monster smiled, led the fox toward the fire... and murdered it. The gray fox's heart was turned into a beautiful drop of water, clear, spotless, and pure.
Nahida: The monster gave the heart of water to the kitten, telling him: "The foxes have decided. You are the one who must be sacrificed. Take this, quench the flames, and die for your fox kin."
Nahida: The fire was extinguished, but the kitten lived. It left that side of the mountain and found a little bird who had a broken wing.
Nahida: The two promised they would spend their whole lives together, but the little bird did not have long left to live. It passed away soon after. After burying the bird, the kitten left the mountain for good.
Nahida: ...Never again would it cherish a single creature, nor a single blade of grass that stood on that mountain. The kitten spent the nights wandering aimlessly, gnashing its teeth at the moon.
Nahida: How it wished to swallow the moon and devour the moonlight. If the world could only return to darkness, then it would finally be peaceful and content.
Nahida: "I will become the new moon, the answer to everything. Then, no one will know that there were once birds, foxes, and cats in this world. And no one can know that they were different."
Paimon: We solved it!
Nahida: ...
Nahida: I remember now. This is not just The Balladeer's story... it is his very own memories. I made a backup so that it would be preserved, no matter what happened.
Nahida: To become a god, he was experimented on and modified countless times. It was brutal torture, and the only reason he was able to survive is that he was a puppet.
Nahida: This memory was extracted from him by the scholars. Presumably, they kept it to have something to defend themselves with...
Nahida: Creating a deity was just the first step. Some of them wanted to be able to control it. That's why they backed up his memory for later use.
Nahida: I buried it deep inside one of my own dreams, and then hid it inside an allegorical story so that it wouldn't be altered.
Paimon: It's hard to believe that this person really existed, let alone that he tried to... get rid of us on more than one occasion...
Paimon: Paimon has no memory of him at all. He completely vanished, like a puff of smoke...
Nahida: The Balladeer agreed to help me look for information about the Descenders, and although he was unsuccessful, he still helped you.
Nahida: Before he vanished, he confirmed an important detail: that Khaenri'ah was where your twin first came into this world.
Nahida: ...We still don't know how the change to Irminsul will affect the senior ranks of the Fatui, but in all likelihood, they won't even remember their own Harbinger.
Traveler: I've never had this feeling before...
Paimon: It sounds like Paimon wouldn't like this guy a whole lot if he was still around. But still, Paimon doesn't like the way it all ended that much better.
Nahida: This is why wisdom alone cannot answer all our questions. We look, we see, and we comprehend, but the question still troubles us.
Nahida: So the answer is not everything. People yearn to find the truth and then conquer the troubles they face.
Nahida: When you give someone the truth, you give them a chance to choose their own destiny.
Nahida: To others looking on, this may seem like a pointless endeavor. But for him, the chance to act on his desire to disappear must have meant a lot.
Nahida: Never forget that even when we walk beneath dark clouds along a road filled with suffering, the light of wisdom is always there, guiding us toward a better destination.
Nahida: And that is what you have been doing all along.
Paimon: Yeah, Nahida's right. Cheer up! How about we go get something to eat? We can pick up this heavy conversation again later!
Nahida: #Good idea. Paimon, why don't you take him out for a walk to clear his head?
Paimon: #You got it! C'mon, Traveler, you need to get out of your head for a while. You'll feel much better after taking a walk.
Traveler: ...It feels like life is as insignificant as a feather.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Katsuragi seems like he was a good guy.
Wanderer: He looks like a warrior, but he has a kind face.
Wanderer: ...Why couldn't he live a long and happy life?

## Talk 5

Wanderer: ...Yeah, this'll do.
Paimon: Even though, as you say, he's The Balladeer... What are we planning on doing, stealing his Sunsettias? Isn't that a bit too cruel?
Traveler: Shush.
Paimon: Oh, alright...
Wanderer: This should be enough. Umm... Ah, guess I should wash them before I take them back...
Traveler: (...If I wasn't seeing this with my own eyes, I would never believe it.)
Wanderer: Huh...?
Wanderer: You two over there, is there something I can help you with?
Paimon: Aah! He spotted us!
Wanderer: You've been following me all the way from the city. I'd have to be blind not to notice.
Traveler: ...You're right, we were following you.
Wanderer: Uh, have we met before?
Wanderer: No, we haven't met... But you know me?
Traveler: Yes.
Wanderer: ...I have no recollection...
Traveler: It's complicated, but I do know you.
Paimon: Uh, are you absolutely sure?
Wanderer: Sorry, but I can't just take your word for it.
Traveler: I can prove it.
Traveler: ...You're a puppet.
Paimon: A puppet? What makes you think that?
Wanderer: ...!
Paimon: Huh!? You were right! The look on his face...
Wanderer: I guess you do know me after all. That is not something I share with a lot of people...
Wanderer: ...Look, I'm just a wanderer. But seeing as you've gone to all this trouble to track me down, I'm sure whatever it is must be important.
Traveler: There's somewhere I want to take you.
Wanderer: Okay, but please let me deliver these goods to my boss first.
Paimon: Are you really working for that guy? He said that you don't want any Mora for it. Is that true?
Wanderer: Yes. I ran into him out in the wilderness during a storm, and he let me take shelter in his cart. In return, I said I'd be his helper for a while.
Paimon: That's oddly nice of you...
Wanderer: Let me take these back, then I'll come with you. Okay?
Traveler: ...Alright.
Paimon: Then, let's return to the city.

## Talk 6

Wanderer: Here you go, Boss. I'll leave them right here.
Merchant: Oh, you really went pick some more... Hmm? Who are these two?
Wanderer: Something's come up, and they need to borrow me. Sorry, Boss, I'm afraid I'll be away from the stall for a while.
Merchant: ... *sigh*
Merchant: I was just about to pay you anyway. Go wherever you want, kid. Don't waste your time here.
Wanderer: What?
Merchant: I get it, okay? You just wanted to help me out to thank me for giving you shelter from the rain that day. Even then, I don't understand why you're so adamant that you don't want any pay for it...
Merchant: But look, it was pouring down, and there you were, sauntering along without a care in the world. Like you had nowhere to be, and didn't even care that it was raining...
Merchant: Imagine you were me for a second. It's a little weird, right? Why's this guy traveling during a rainstorm if he's not trying to get somewhere? And why's he taking a shortcut through the open country if he's not even in a hurry?
Wanderer: Uh...
Merchant: But anyway, taking you in didn't put me out even slightly. You don't owe me a thing for it, certainly not all this... Your time is valuable, y'know? You should go live your life.
Wanderer: ...But, I don't...
Wanderer: ...No. You're right.
Wanderer: Then I suppose this is where we say goodbye. Thank you again for taking me into the city.
Merchant: Don't mention it, kiddo. I've run into all kinds of characters over the years... I just hope you find your path.
Wanderer: ...Thank you.
Wanderer: Alright, done. Thanks for waiting for me. We can go now.

## Talk 7

Katsuragi: Nagamasa, I found this young guy in a cave sealed off by a landslide. He doesn't remember his name.
Mikoshi Nagamasa: ...Well, we need to call you something. I hear the workers are calling you "the kabukimono"?
The Balladeer: That's fine with me.
Mikoshi Nagamasa: Katsuragi, report to Niwa. Tell him we have someone new joining us.

## Talk 8

The Balladeer: You do realize you're blocking my path?
The Jester: I come not to obstruct you. I have been waiting.
The Jester: What you are, truly, is a weapon, one that could be wielded with an iron will... or, you could continue to drift aimlessly.
The Balladeer: ...Are you trying to win me over?
The Jester: The long-fated rebellion has begun. Why not take your place at the banquet and join those who shall feast?

## Talk 9

Merchant: *sigh* ...That was a good batch of Sunsettias, too...

## Talk 10

Paimon: Huh? What are we doing back here?
Traveler: I hear voices!
Child: Whoa... This is where you were born? It's pretty! But there's nobody here... *cough*
The Balladeer: I was abandoned, like you. I lived here for a while at first, but... There's nothing for us here. We can't stay...
Child: ...Okay.
Child: I heard my mom and dad used to make swords, but the factory manager died, and then my dad got sick... *cough*
Child: He kept coughing all the time, just like me. Then, Mom started coughing too...
The Balladeer: But you can't. You promised me.
Child: Yep, we're family now. We're gonna be together for ever and ever!
Nahida: This child didn't have a name. Or rather... The Balladeer didn't know what to call him. His father died before he could name him.
Nahida: After his mother died, the child stayed in their straw hut alone. Some of the neighbors helped to raise him.
Nahida: After leaving Tatarasuna, The Balladeer ran into this child who didn't have a name, just like him. They made a promise to live together.
Paimon: What happened to the child then?
Nahida: He died from his illness while he was still very young. The Balladeer came home one day and found that he had stopped breathing.
The Balladeer: ...Hey! Whâ€”What's wrong...? Say something!!!
The Balladeer: ...You promised me we could be family! You're no different from Niwa and all the others... You betrayed me too. Haha...
Wanderer: ...
Wanderer: The voices have gone. It looks like the memory ends here.
Paimon: Let's keep going.

## Talk 11

Sawada: Great, I can finally move forward with my novel! But what a sad story...
Aqaba: I don't know what I was expecting, but... I never would have guessed this...

## Talk 12

Signora: Why are you staring at me in silence? Can't you think of a nicer way to express yourself?
The Balladeer: I'm under no obligation to be nice to you. Besides, I thought nothing mattered to you except results and your own interests. Isn't that right... witch?
Signora: Hehe... Muddle-headed puppet, you're only No. 6 because you can take more abuse than other humans. Do you really count that as an asset?
The Balladeer: You're about as much fun to be around as a raging inferno. But before we murder each other, it'd be best if we finish our duties.

## Talk 13

Nahida: There's a few things I'd like to look into. You should go take a walk and try to unwind.

## Talk 14

Nahida: It's time to get ready.

## Talk 15

#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...This is trying my patience.
Paimon: Have you got all your memories back now?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Have you got any more stupid questions!?

## Talk 16

Wanderer: No matter what lies ahead, I'll face it. Whatever it takes. I'm just sorry that you have to join me for the whole thing.

## Talk 17

Wanderer: You're a god... Do you think I'm evil?
Nahida: If you accept that he is you, just as you are you, then yes â€” you are evil.
Wanderer: In your eyes, are there any differences between humans and puppets?
Nahida: Do you think there are any differences between your present self and your previous and future incarnations? If not, then what are the differences between humans and puppets?
Nahida: Whoever has tasted the joys and sorrows of life in the human realm is human. Whoever has loved and lost, cried with grief, howled with rage at the tragedy of death that eclipses the miracle of life... they are human, too.
Wanderer: ...
Wanderer: I've seen enough of my past. If possible, I'd like to reclaim the sins that are mine to bear.
Wanderer: No matter the consequences, I won't run from blame or punishment. Whatever I am due, let it come to pass.
Traveler: Are you saying...
Wanderer: Can you return my memories to me?
Paimon: Huh? But won't that mean you'll lose your current identity?
Wanderer: I've always believed that human lives follow a set of rules, with each person being a collection of past experiences.
Wanderer: As a puppet living in the human world, my life is subject to the same rules.
Nahida: Regaining your memories means reverting completely to your previous incarnation. All the emotions that you discarded will return to you.
Nahida: Are you sure you want to do this?
Wanderer: I've lived with a void in my chest my whole life. My creator didn't need me, and ever since I awoke, I've just drifted from one place to the next.
Wanderer: But then I met you, and I finally realized that reclaiming my missing sins might be my one opportunity to become my true self.
Traveler: (...Is this the true meaning of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's words? A person can't erase themselves, and even though the original Balladeer has gone, this person will live on in his place...)
Traveler: (Are a person's sins an inescapable part of their destiny too?)
Wanderer: I've always felt I have an innate tendency to yearn for something more, in a way that goes deeper than for most people... But for all my soul-searching as a shugenja, I've never fully understood it. Looking at it now, it seems that I brought this curse upon myself.
Wanderer: So I beg you... grant me this opportunity to gain a purpose. To change my destiny and end my wandering.
Nahida: Very well.
Nahida: Since your mind is made up, I will return to you that which is yours.

## Talk 18

Merchant: Don't worry about me.

## Talk 19

The Balladeer's Mecha: ...!!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Imbecile! Get out of my sight!
Paimon: ...It disappeared... Did we win?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: What did you expect? I'd never lose to that.
Paimon: Ehh, there's that tone of voice again. You're definitely back to your old self...
Paimon: Wait, but it was you inside that thing, too. What have you got to be smug about?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Sorry, I'm harsh on myself and everyone else. Just the way I am.
Traveler: Now you've recovered your memories...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Haha, you sound like you're concerned about me.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: But don't worry. Thanks to you, even if I didn't change a thing... at least I now know the truth.
Nahida: The memory recovery seems to have been a success. This dream has served its purpose.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Come on. Let's continue this outside.
Traveler: The past will catch up with you.
