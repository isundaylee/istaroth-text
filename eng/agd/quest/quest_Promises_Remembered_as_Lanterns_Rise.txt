# Promises Remembered as Lanterns Rise


## Talk 1

Smiley Yanxiao: I have to hurry...
Traveler: Is business that good?
Smiley Yanxiao: No. But it's the Lantern Rite now. Lots of people have headed back to the city to spend the festive period there, so we're short-staffed. I'm basically doing everything myself.
Smiley Yanxiao: We're not getting too many guests, though, so things aren't too bad. I can still handle it.
Smiley Yanxiao: *cough* Also, I should thank you for helping me previously. If it hadn't been for your help, I don't think I'd ever have been able to return to work...
Traveler: Ah. So recently...
Smiley Yanxiao: N—No! Definitely not, believe me! I—If she were to show up again, I d—don't know if my heart could take it...
Smiley Yanxiao: If you really want to ask about... her... you should just go ask the boss. I—I don't know anything, I swear...
Traveler: So, has she...

## Talk 2

Verr Goldet: Traveler! How can I help?
Traveler: About Dusky Ming...
Verr Goldet: Oh, her? She's been quite well-behaved since that incident.
Verr Goldet: But I do feel bad for that child. Whenever a festive period rolled along in the past, she'd get lonelier as the inn grew livelier. As a result, she would wind up starting trouble and scaring the guests.
Verr Goldet: But I'm sure that she just wants someone to play with her. She is only a child, after all.
Traveler: Can we send her a Xiao Lantern?
Verr Goldet: You want to send her a Xiao Lantern? That's not a bad idea. The only trouble is that she's quite hard to find...
Verr Goldet: If you're looking for her, you should hang a Xiao Lantern atop one of the trees in the nearby forest at night.
Verr Goldet: That way, she should be able to see it.
Traveler: I wonder if she'd like a Xiao Lantern...

## Talk 3

Verr Goldet: Well, did you deliver the Xiao Lantern?
Traveler: I guess... we can consider it sent.
Verr Goldet: I believe so, too. This should cheer her up a bit at least.
Verr Goldet: I wonder, what sort of wish would that child make?

## Talk 4

Smiley Yanxiao: If you really want to ask about... her... you should just go ask the boss. I—I don't know anything, I swear...

## Talk 5

Verr Goldet: If you're looking for her, you should hang a Xiao Lantern atop one of the trees in the nearby forest.
Verr Goldet: That way, she should be able to see it.

## Talk 6

Paimon: This should be the place. Wonder where she is...
Dusky Ming: Oh, you're back. You're here to play with me!
Dusky Ming: Hehe, did you remember what I said last time?
Dusky Ming: Well then, let's play... hide and seek.
