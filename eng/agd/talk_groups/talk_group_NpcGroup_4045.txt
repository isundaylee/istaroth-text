Traveler: Tell me about yourself...
Khalid: I'm an antique collector, and I sell jewelry here and there.
Khalid: Precious antiques are worth treasuring, and their prices are also out of the budgets of ordinary people, so it's not about making sales for me.
Khalid: What I do care about is whether I can get more vendors as discerning as Lord Sangemah Bay to supply me with the most valuable collectors' items.
Khalid: ...That is to say, trading is more like my side business.
Khalid: As for my main business... I suppose that would be to raise my son into a collector with taste as astute as my own.
Khalid: Feresht is a gifted child. I'm certain he can become an even more renowned antiques appraisal expert than me.
