Mr. Zhu: If only I could eat it again, it was so good...
Traveler: Eat what again?
Mr. Zhu: Oh, a traveler. When I was young I used to travel all over the place. What I loved most about traveling was getting to try all the different foods.
Mr. Zhu: After eating my way across the continent, I returned to Liyue and opened my restaurant, Emerald Maple, in the hopes I could recreate the flavors of my travels.
Mr. Zhu: But there's this one dish I can never quite remember the name of.

Mr. Zhu: Just how am I going to recreate that flavor?

## Talk 1

Traveler: I get it.
Mr. Zhu: All I remember is it was a sweet, fragrant dish. The sheer look of it was enough to get me drooling at the mouth... And to top it all off, it was nutritious too.
Mr. Zhu: The ingredients are a lot of Fowl and some Sweet Flowers. It's called... Sweetened Mistress or something like that. If you'd be able to make one for me, I'd be ever so grateful.
Mr. Zhu: Traveler — over to you!

## Talk 2

Traveler: What a tragedy!
Mr. Zhu: *sigh* I've eaten such a wide variety of delicious foods in my time that I just can't remember what this one was...

## Talk 3

Mr. Zhu: You're back! Did you find the mystery dish?
Traveler: Yes.
Mr. Zhu: Great! Give it here...
Traveler: Not yet.
Mr. Zhu: No problem. Take your time with the search... But please don't forget about it.

## Talk 4

Mr. Zhu: Thank you ever so much! Please take this for your trouble, traveler.

## Talk 6

Mr. Zhu: Greetings, esteemed guest! Are you here to put your feet up for a while, or are you checking in for a night or more?

### Talk 6 related talk 0

Traveler: I'd like to buy a snack.
Mr. Zhu: Need a bite to eat? What can I get you?

### Talk 6 related talk 1

Traveler: Just passing by.
Mr. Zhu: Uh... Great! That works too — care to stop in for a nice cup of hot tea or a bite to eat?

### Talk 6 related talk 2

Traveler: It's pretty deserted here.
Mr. Zhu: *sigh* Yeah, tell me about it... I should have listened to my old man and stayed at home, what am I doing, trying to run this inn out here...
Mr. Zhu: I sure picked a bad spot to open an inn — it's right between Wangshu Inn and Liyue Harbor...
Mr. Zhu: Travelers coming down from the north always pass by Wangshu Inn and end up stopping off there, and as for the travelers coming up from the south...
Mr. Zhu: They pretty much only ever come up this way after drinking themselves into a stupor in Liyue Harbor...
Mr. Zhu: ...*sigh* So it looks like I'm never going to have any guests here.
Traveler: What are you going to do about this place?
Mr. Zhu: I'll keep it going as long as I can... If no one ends up staying here, I guess it'll be time for a not-so-grand closing; then I'll just sell off this god-forsaken place for whatever I can get.
Mr. Zhu: It's just not possible to make a living in this line of work...
Mr. Zhu: And I'm not exactly a top-tier talent. *sigh* There's nothing going for me... I guess I'll just have to go back home and take over the three jade mining facilities my old man left behind, and just try my best to get by in life.
