Traveler: About the Fortune Slips...
Wolsey: We ask everyone to help write the fortunes. Sometimes we all need a little pep talk and a little courage from people in the same circumstances as us.
Wolsey: Although we have had problems with people trying to write inappropriate fortunes to stir up trouble... It's a real headache.
Wolsey: I'm just trying to do something nice for everyone, but now I have to waste my time checking all the fortunes.
Wolsey: Thankfully, none of them have caused any major problems... But if any fortunes end up causing me misfortune, then the cost will have exceeded the benefits.
