## 2. Character Story 1

There's a certain young lady who tends to leave a deep impression on anyone who's spent any length of time among the People of the Springs, be they resident or tourist.
For example, let's say you're enjoying a peaceful sunbathing session by the sea, and you suddenly hear a "Woohoooooo~~!" in the distance that quickly gets closer as a young lady on a surfboard rides a wave all the way to the shore at high speeds, leaping onto the beach and kicking up a curtain of sand.
Or maybe you're watching a beach volleyball match, and a certain lithe young lady shouts encouragement to her teammates before springing straight up the next second, spiking the ball back towards the other side, your shout of excitement resonating with the waves.
And then there was that one time you were invited to join a gathering, and a bunch of guests meeting for the first time were talking quietly, and people still seemed kinda tense. Just then, she showed up, like a superstar taking the stage, and announced at the top of her lungs:
"C'mon, why's it so quiet? Music's playing, that means it's time to boogie!"
And with that, she leaped to the center of the dance floor, swaying her body in time to the music, while those around her, infected by her enthusiasm, joined in one after another...
You attempted to ask around about who she was, and you instantly got a name without even having to try: Mualani.
And later, when you went to buy some watersports equipment, there in the shop, you saw that beaming face once more.
At first, you were only planning on buying a surfboard, but you ended up learning all about the different locations of the various hot springs of the People of the Springs and how the experiences they offer differ, important tips and tricks for surfing, as well as where to find her little Koholasaurus friends. Of course, she also recommended that you buy a blue board, since it'll bring you good luck.
"Actually, I've seen you before..." You attempt to bring up all the times you met before.
"Oh wow, I didn't realize you were an old friend! In that case, I'll give you 40% off this time, and be sure to come find me if you want some surfing lessons!"
You originally intended to just kick back and relax for a few days, but ended up staying for several months. Over time, you two did in fact end up becoming good friends. One day, your curiosity gets the better of you and you finally ask her why she is so enthusiastic towards every single one of her friends, and even some strangers.
"Yeah, I'd say... There are two kinds of people in the world. Friends you already know, and friends you haven't met yet."
Mualani thinks about it for a moment, then gives you a big smile.

## 3. Character Story 2

Mualani's parents are both quite successful merchants. Not only have they established a trade network that spanned Natlan, but they have even established partnerships with foreign merchants.
When she was little, her parents were always busy cultivating relationships with their business contacts, and sometimes, they'd be running around outside the home for weeks at a time. So, Mualani would often roam around town with their puppy, or spend her time with the other kids in the tribe, trying their hand at all kinds of watersports.
It was only on holidays that the family would always decorate their house and make a big meal to celebrate.
During one such family dinner, Mualani asked if she could help lighten their load and shoulder a bit of their work. That way, they should have more quality time together as a family.
"Lots of adults say I've got an ideal personality for doing business!" said she.
Her mother thought Mualani ought to try doing many different things, experience different places, and then decide what she really wanted to do.
Her father added that it wouldn't be too late for her to join the family business if she still wanted to be a merchant afterward, but that they would support her completely should anything else capture her interest.
In the end, Mualani did travel all over, flitting freely over every peak and valley of Natlan like a bird. Many of those faraway vistas were truly enchanting, but as a seabird whose home was by the coast, she often missed the salty smell of the seabreeze.
And so she returned home and engaged in all kinds of watersports, researching the equipment used in them. She wasn't satisfied with the completed products available, so she began learning how to manually modify their functionality herself. She would also apply some lucky colors and some patterns, giving the products a dash more personality.
She became the trendsetter, and every time she changed her gear, everyone else would fall all over themselves to get identical items. Mualani was more than happy to indulge their requests, and over time, she became an "equipment seller" and earned a tidy sum.
Ever since the Leisurely Puffer opened, it has also become more of a gathering place for watersports enthusiasts. Naturally, some among them are more into the sports aspect, and others are more focused on the equipment.
Regardless, Mualani gradually experienced the joy of operating a business — the smiles on the faces of people when they receive something they love shine brighter than glittering gold.
What is this really what Mualani wants to do the most? If you ask her that question, she'll definitely scratch her head:
"Hey, life's a journey, you know, and you can keep on enjoying all kinds of scenery as long as it lasts! There's no rush to decide on a destination, especially when there's such a long way to go! That's what makes it so fun!"

## 4. Character Story 3

Mualani used to never plan ahead when traveling. Whenever she arrived someplace, she'd wander around, chatting with locals and asking about fun things to do nearby, good places to eat, or any unique local customs, and then decide on the spot what to do that day.
If she really hit it off with someone, she'd happily invite them along. This usually developed into a lively party, or a fun excursion nearby.
As long as Mualani isn't running too short on time, she'll soon know "the sights and places only the locals know" like the back of her hand.
Sometimes, other tourists and sightseers will ask her for directions, and as soon as she starts expounding on her knowledge of the area, it's hard to blame them for assuming she's a guide and offering her money to show them around.
Mualani would repeatedly wave her hands: "A guide must ensure the safety of travelers, and that's way out of my league! Besides, I only just got here myself!"
Friends visiting the People of the Springs from afar was when Mualani really got to show her skills.
Some of her friends said she was a born guide, and others urged her:
"Once you're a guide, take us to dragon ruins nobody else has even been to for a look! Maybe we'll find some valuable swag!"
Mualani thought it all sounded very doable, so the next day, she went and found the famous guide, Nuu, and asked to be his student.
She asked him, just what skills does a guide that wants to take people exploring need to master?
Nuu thought for a second: "First is wilderness survival, such as the behaviors of wild animals, the uses of and how to cook common plants, and how to pick a good campsite. Next is knowing the land itself, such as how to judge the direction of the tides and the length of time between eruptions. You must also have actually traveled across the landscape, traversing the canyons, caves, and volcanoes. Yes, spend about three years doing that, and you'll be ready to start learning."
Mualani was about to just turn and leave, but suddenly thought better of it. She did want to see many places she ordinarily wouldn't, and so she paid a huge sum as her tuition fee.
Though Nuu emphasized that reaching your destination safely was the most important thing, Mualani could never resist seeing where the other fork in the road led. After all, what if there was some amazing treasure waiting to be found? And so, all kinds of accidents inevitably happened, like accidentally charging into Koholasaurus nests or falling into pits concealed by grasses.
But Mualani didn't fuss about such situations. To her, taking the wrong road helped her remember the right path, not to mention that sometimes, her misadventures led to windfalls — for example, finding an ore unknown to anyone in their time buried at the bottom of the pit.
Later, when she officially became a guide, she remembered her teacher's words, and planned the safest, most reliable routes for travelers. Still, a journey without happy accidents was kind of like an Apple Roly Poly without Apple, and that was completely unacceptable to Mualani.
Once, she was taking some tourists to a plateau that commanded an expansive view. She suggested a group photo, and just as they had all gotten into their poses and chosen their expressions, just as Mualani was lifting up the Kamera, a volcano in the distance suddenly erupted.
Mualani pressed the shutter in that very instant, and clapped and laughed at the resulting photo. "A perfect shot! Go me! Guess I planned out the best spot for the picture, huh?"
Just then, a massive rumbling caused the tourists to look at each other apprehensively. Mualani reassured them:
"Relax, it's totally safe at this distance! Next up, there'll be a few smaller eruptions. You'll never see anything else like it, so have a seat and enjoy the show!"
That's the kind of reliable guide Mualani is, helping you reach your destination safely even amidst heart-stopping excitement.
Shame, though, that even to this day, she's never found a Saurian relic that can fetch a decent price.

## 5. Character Story 4

"C'mon, pleeeeease, you've gotta tell me my fortune for this trip!" Mualani's whole body was slumped against the door as she shouted. "I'll paaaay!"
"Go find someone else!" Citlali — the high priestess of the Masters of the Night-Wind, who had left the tribe to live alone, was inside her home on the other side of the door, also pressed against it — "You're just taking some people out for a stroll, just what the heck kinda danger do you think there is? Don't overthink it, girl!"
Separated only by Citlali's door, their epic struggle unfolded. It was only when Citlali finally threatened Mualani with having to pay her back the full retail price for the door if it broke that peace finally reigned once more.
Yet there was no way Mualani would be discouraged so easily, so she brought a basket brimming with food on her next visit.
Fried shrimp beanballs, blazed meat stew, Saurus crackers... Though Citlali by no means wished to entertain guests — well, she mostly just didn't want to bother tidying up her place — but for the sake of the food, she let her in.
After Citlali had eaten and drunk to her heart's content, Mualani sought to strike while the iron was hot and take advantage of Citlali's good mood, unleashing her finishing move:
"Say, Granny, you know that a new volume of 'Mirage Warriors' is coming out soon, don't you?"
Citlali was unfazed. "As a loyal reader who has reached the level of a walking encyclopedia, of course I know."
"You know, my next clients are visiting Natlan for inspiration, some editors and authors from the Yae Publishing House... Oh my, maybe I could even get an advance copy!"
"Ahem! The lands of Natlan are suffused with mystery and the unknown. We must all revere the night and fire. I shall make an exception and divine your fortune this time."
...
"Should you encounter a fork in the road, you must take the right-hand path." Such was the revelation that the Night-Wind that blew upon the future brought to Citlali in her meditations. "It's a good thing you came to me, girl. Were you not forewarned, the consequences would have been unthinkable."
Before setting out, Mualani double-checked the map. There should be but one way to the destination. But when Mualani's party reached the volcano's innards, a crossroads unmarked on the map appeared before them. Apparently, the active volcano had already altered the terrain in the area.
Following Citlali's advice, she was able to lead the entire group to the original destination without incident, as expected.
From then on, Mualani respectfully referred to Citlali as the "coolest elder," and often brought her all kinds of presents as she sought "life advice." It was from that time that the frequency of Mualani's mentions of "good luck" and "bad luck" began to steadily tick upwards.
Even to this day, the two wage war from opposite sides of Citlali's door. Should Citlali slip up and find herself on the back foot, then Mualani will once more barge into her home through the crack in the door.

## 6. Character Story 5

The war between Natlan and the Abyss has lasted for centuries. Like most other natives of Natlan, Mualani grew up on a diet of the stories of those legendary heroes. But the life she actually saw was nothing like that chronicled in the woven scrolls, filled with danger and excitement.
The People of the Springs that Mualani remembered had a really laid-back atmosphere, and they lived leisurely lives, never too hurried. When the big kahunas agreed to discuss some important matter or another, they'd usually take a nice comfy soak in the hot springs first, then enjoy some snacks along with milk before finally slowly getting around to the actual business.
Even the music popular amongst the tribe tended to be really laid-back and mellow.
Hearing those stories of distant battlefields as a child, the puzzled Mualani once posed this question to an elder tasked to serve as a guardian:
"Is the Abyss a dangerous enemy? But then, why doesn't anybody seem nervous at all?"
The elder guffawed, and she patted Mualani's head. "It's not all that scary. Once you're all grown up, you'll be able to defeat it too."
Mualani was still a bit confused, but it wasn't a very pressing concern, so she tossed it to the back of her mind for the time being and kept on growing up, without a care in the world.
Until one night, when the Abyss suddenly attacked her tribe. Mualani witnessed with her own eyes how the guardians strove against the monsters, and finally understood that the carefree life she had always enjoyed was not to be taken for granted.
Following the elders of the tribe, she slowly learned the ways of battle. Her long experience with watersports ensured that she had phenomenal physical capabilities, and she was like a charging shark in battle.
Later, she organized a team to participate in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, but as the squad was mostly composed of newcomers, they quickly wiped out in the team round.
Her teammates were pretty dejected, but Mualani was as cheerful as ever: "We managed to go a few rounds with the pros! That's already pretty awesome! Plus, we got a lot of experience, so we'll do even better next time!"
And just like she said, they steadily improved each time they participated, until finally, they earned their laurels and the right to participate in the Night Warden Wars.
Then, her impression of the Abyssal enemy was still that of her memories of the night from all those years ago: Huge, powerful, unstoppable. Yet when she and her companions came face-to-face with their foes, she unexpectedly found that she could take them down, one after another.
"Looks like today's my lucky day, I didn't run into anything too tough."
This "good luck" never left her, and she participated in three Night Warden Wars and was victorious in all three, never even needing to be resurrected.
Each time she returned triumphant, the tribe would hold a huge hot springs party. Children who had heard tell of her experiences would run over and beg her to teach them her fighting techniques.
"I wanna be an awesome warrior like you, too!"
Looking at their innocent faces, Mualani was reminded of her own childhood, and how she too and asked her elders questions. She smiled and waved her hands.
"The Abyss isn't that scary, you know! You should be having fun now — save the fighting stuff for when you're all grown up!"
"Oh, right! Let me teach you how to surf next time!"

## 7. "Sharky Surfboard"

Once, when Mualani was surfing, she encountered a freshwater shark. Though initially far away, it approached her rapidly and soundlessly, before suddenly breaching the surface, its razor-sharp teeth reflecting the sunlight with a cold gleam.
"Haha, are you here to surf too?" Mualani nimbly cut back, swiftly switching directions and dodging its attack. She sped up, putting some distance between them: "In that case, let's race!"
Accepting her challenge, the freshwater shark pursued her relentlessly as Mualani sped on ahead with everything she had, the spray laying a long white raceway for them.
As they approached the coastline, the freshwater shark turned back in a fury, its hunt a failure. Mualani, not far away, waved back at it: "Let's play again next time!"
Later, she would encounter this same challenger in those same waters. Mualani dubbed it "Sharky," and the two of them raced over and over. In the first few rounds, Mualani was faster, but the shark was not to be outdone, and slowly closed the gap, until finally, it caught her. But that time, it didn't chomp her, but instead elegantly shook its chubby body, announcing itself the victor.
"You won this one! Okay, here's your promised reward." Mualani fed it the dried fish she'd brought, and rubbed its fins.
They became true surfing buddies. Until one day, after they finished playing, Sharky circled her a few times, and then waved its caudal fin, swimming off in the direction of the setting sun.
Mualani waved as she usually did, but when she next went to her old spot to surf, she didn't see that speedy round shape as she normally did.
Mualani knew that any encounter is but a part of the journey, and that everyone eventually finds their new destination. Still, that doesn't mean the happiness that was shared must disappear.
So thinking, Mualani took out a piece of paper, and began to draw. Two weeks later, she handed the design for the "Sharky Surfboard" to an artisan she was familiar with. Sharky's fins were hard, but its tail was flexible. To achieve this, she chose her materials carefully, also recreating the texture of Sharky's skin, and even reproducing how its teeth meshed together.
As for the color scheme, it naturally had to be eye-catching so that everyone who saw Sharky would remember what it looked like!
And so, with her new gear in tow, Mualani was the center of attention once more. Amidst the ardent cries, the "Sharky Surfboard" was eventually mass-produced and sold to the public — though naturally, that version can't bite.
When Mualani surfs, she occasionally wonders when the next time she'll get to race Sharky is. After all, Mualani really wants to know just who is faster: Sharky Surfboard, or Sharky.

## 8. Vision

Mualani would later profoundly understand what the Ancient Name "Umoja" signified, yet her personal perception of it actually began on what was — at first — a perfectly peaceful night many years before.
That night, it was already midnight as she and her friends' boisterous hot springs party was winding down. Everyone was still soaking in the joyous afterglow when a loud sound in the distance shattered the quiet. It was wholly out of place, and made all the more clear by the night's prior tranquility.
Everyone was staring at each other uneasily, unsure of what had happened. Just then, Atea, who had been patrolling, hurried over: "All of you, run for safety! It's an Abyss attack!"
The scene immediately exploded into chaos, as everyone prepared to flee, yet Mualani raised her hand high: "Atea! I'd like to stay and help!"
After Mualani stepped up, the others too slowly began to step forward, hoping to contribute what they could.
"Nope, none of you have any combat experience. It's too dangerous for you to stay here. Battle is no joking matter."
But Mualani's determination was no joke either. As a member of the tribe, she didn't think she should stay out of it.
"There should be ways we can help other than fighting."
As Mualani said this, she looked back at those familiar friends who had also chosen to stay—
Irapa's feet had wings, and he was a supremely fast runner. He could go alert nearby residents. Ollanta had a powerful physique, and good eyesight, and was perfect for helping patrol, while Yana had once been a lifeguard, and knew first-aid techniques, so she could act in a supporting role...
"And as for me," Mualani stepped onto her surfboard, her pride and joy, "My speed is second to none. I'll go wherever I'm needed!"
Her companions agreed, and Atea had better things to do than try and stop them, so she directed them to take care of each other and put safety first.
"In that case, Mualani, come with me to find the Abyssal Pylons."
...
Mualani followed the Spiritways, scouting the area around the tribe and confirming the Abyssal Pylon locations. Every time she found one, she'd relay the information to the guardians as they fought.
There was one Pylon that was disgorging an inordinate number of monsters, and the warriors were pitted in a bitter struggle against them. By the time Mualani finally was able to find reinforcements, the battlefield was already scorched and blackened.
Atea's blade flashed, its keen edge cleaving deep into a monster's body, just as yet another monster behind her was bracing itself to strike.
"Watch out!" Mualani shouted at the top of her lungs as she accelerated towards the monster, colliding with it in mid-leap and bowling it over — but in the process, she herself became utterly exposed.
Having been so challenged, the monster turned and raised its keen claws towards Mualani. She shrank back and tensed, but the attack never came. Warm blood splashed her face, as Atea's sharp steel pierced its heart clean through.
...
The grueling battle lasted until daybreak. When they finally confirmed that all the Abyssal Pylons had been sealed, Mualani followed behind Atea and the guardians, returning exhausted to the tribe.
Mualani noticed that everyone was injured to a greater or lesser extent. Some had already done emergency first-aid, wrapping the wounds in bandages. By comparison, having been protected by everyone else, she only had a few shallow scrapes.
A new feeling welled up in her heart, regret mixed with a feeling of defiance, a resolve not to merely accept this result. "If only I were faster, then I'd have been of more help."
She clenched her fists, and privately made up her mind. She would seek out the warriors of the tribe to learn how to fight.
It was only after Atea brought Mualani back home that her anxious parents, who had been worrying all night, learned she had returned from the battlefield.
"She really is a very brave kid." Before she left, Atea patted her cheek.
...
That day, Mualani dreamed for a very long time. Had her face not lain on something very hard when she rolled over, she might've slept yet longer.
Opening her eyes, she felt that hard object in her hand — a crystal-clear Vision.
Following the rays of sunlight streaming in through the window, she caressed it in her palm, inspecting it carefully over and over to make sure it wasn't some toy her parents had bought for her.
"Is this the spoils for winning my first fight? Now that's what I'd call lucky!"
