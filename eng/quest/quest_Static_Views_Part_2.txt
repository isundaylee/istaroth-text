# Static Views, Part 2


## Talk 1

Paimon: Whoa! The Aranara world is truly marvelous... Just looking at a painting would lead you to the treasure...
Paimon: Now, we've found the locations of all the paintings! Paimon wonders where the Aranara who made these treasure maps is...
Traveler: Not all of them...
Paimon: Right, there's that painting with many Aranara in it. We didn't find any treasure there...
Paimon (???): (Something seems to be vibrating slightly in the bag.)
Traveler: (Find the vibrating item.)
Paimon: Huh? Is this... the seed we found in The Chasm?
Traveler: Seems like it's leading us somewhere...
Paimon: Hmm... That might be it! Let's keep an eye on the seed in case it vibrates again!
Paimon: Maybe it could be a trapped Aranara! Or perhaps there's something like an Aranara treasury? And this seed is the key?
Traveler: So strange.
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon thinks it wants to go somewhere! Let's keep an eye on the seed in case it vibrates again!
Traveler: There's another place...

## Talk 3

Araminali (???): Eek! It's the Golden Nara! There is the taste of the wind, the taste of earth, and the taste of Aranara!
Araminali (???): Golden Nara has figured out the Ararakalari of Arayama?
Araminali (???): How dreadful! Obstructions are useless, anyone can break in, and the "happy nest" of Araminali will be "broken!"
Paimon: Wow, don't worry, we mean no harm.
Araminali: What does "no harm" mean? Do you mean "no greed"?
Paimon: #Um... Paimon guesses so! Traveler and Paimon are on Aranara's side. We want to be Aranara's good friends.
Traveler: Paimon is gluttonous, but not bad in nature.
Paimon: Hey! That's technically not wrong, though...
Araminali: Aranara's best friend... The Golden Nara smells like Aranara, a familiar smell, but I haven't smelled it for a long time...
Paimon: #Ah, by the way, that strange seed! Traveler, show the seeds to Araminali. Maybe he knows something.
Araminali: Uhh! He is thirsty! He needs to drink a lot of water before he can change back to what he was. Come... there's a lot of water here. Let him drink enough to recover.
Black Screen Text: You put the seed in the water...
Aranimba (???): ...Wow! It's changing back!
Paimon: #Wow! The seed has become an Aranara! We found it, "the trapped Aranara"! You see, is Paimon right, Traveler?
Traveler: I can't believe "the trapped Aranara" does exist...
Araminali: It's Aranimba! Unlike Araminali, Aranimba likes to travel around. Before, he would draw the scenery he saw from afar and send it back to Vanarana, but later...
Aranimba: Later, Aranimba went to a very hard and dark place, with little dirt, but a lot of stones... Under the soil, there was little grass and few trees, but a lot of mushrooms!
Paimon: Um... Sounds like The Chasm. But, Aranimba, as an Aranara, traveled so far that he even left Sumeru...
Aranimba: Yes! It was a long way, and dangerous. Aranimba met the dark and dangerous Nara! However, Aranimba was protected by Aramuhukunda, and turned into a seed and "got away with it."
Aranimba: Now Aranimba is back safely, thanks to Golden Nara and White Floaty.
Paimon: #It's Traveler and Paimon!
Araminali: #Yes! Nara Traveler and Paimon, Aranara's friends!
Aranimba: #Araminali is Aranimba's "good friend," so Nara Traveler and Paimon are also Aranimba's "good friends". Aranimba gets it now!
Aranimba: Aranimba is going to leave, this time, not only painting, Aranimba will send back "gift" to Araminali, put it in the "chest."
Araminali: All the "chests" here belong to Araminali. Araminali is the owner of the "treasure chests."
Araminali: For good friends of Aranara who helped a lot of Aranara... Aranara will be "grateful," and will put the "treasure" into the "chest."
Paimon: So the chest was empty!?
Araminali: Aranara knew everything about Vana when they were born, but when "chests" were born, they were empty! Araminali doesn't know why.
Paimon: Paimon doesn't understand too...
Araminali: #...When Araminali has filled the "treasure chests," Nara Traveler can open it. Sometimes Nara Traveler will cheer with "Oh yeah" and sometimes sigh with "Ah..." just as the green Nara does.
Paimon: Why bother? Araminali and Aranimba can directly give us what you're about to put in the treasure chests as the payment.
Araminali: #Araminali knows that the green Nara likes to go into the cave or in the house and open the "treasure chest." Nara Traveler, and Paimon, don't like it?
Paimon: Oh... It's not like Paimon doesn't like it... It feels like... there is an inexplicable attraction?
Araminali: Well, Nara likes "treasure chests," and so does Araminali. Araminali allows the good Nara who had helped Aranara to open the "treasure chests."
Araminali: Vana has a lot of Aranara, some in need of help, and some want to play with Nara. Nara who realizes their wishes is Aranara's friend.
Araminali: Such Nara can open the "treasure chests" prepared by Araminali.
Aranimba: So Aranimba should leave now, to fill the "treasure chests."
Paimon: Hey? But didn't Aranimba just come back? Are you leaving again? You are really in a rush... like running from a fire with the headwind...
Aranimba: Eek! It's nice to have wind, but not fire. Getting too close to the fire makes Aranimba thirsty again.
Paimon: Ah, Paimon means, how could Aranimba be in such a hurry? Aranimba could stay for a while and catch up with Araminali.
Paimon: Araminali, you haven't seen Aranimba for a long time. Don't you have a lot to say to Aranimba?
Araminali: Aranimba is the Aranara that will never stop so Aranimba can't be the owner of the "treasure chests."
Araminali: Regarding the whereabouts of Aranimba, as long as Vana knows, wind knows, flowers and grass know, Araminali will know.
Araminali: So, it's fine. Don't need to say much. Araminali will listen so long as Aranimba wants to say.
Paimon: #Um... Is this Aranara's friendship? If it were Paimon, Paimon would have a lot to share with Traveler.
Traveler: Are you alright?

## Talk 4

Aranimba: #Thank you, Nara Traveler and Paimon, for bringing Aranimba back. The water in Vanarana is the best! And Aranimba is ready to go in no time.
