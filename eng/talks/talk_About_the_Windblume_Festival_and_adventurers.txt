Traveler: About the Windblume Festival and adventurers...
Schulz: A lot of couples will choose to have dates at Cape Oath, but there are some brave adventurer couples who will venture near Stormterror's Lair.
Schulz: That area is simply crawling with monsters, so many adventurers will come here to purchase new equipment...
Schulz: ...After all, if you were to be beaten by monsters in that place, you wouldn't just lose face â€” you'd be putting your companion in danger, too...
Schulz: So each time the Windblume Festival rolls around, we smiths run brisker business than usual, so I suppose we can be thankful for that.
