Traveler: May I use the Crafting Bench here?
Kimiya: Ah, sure, go ahead. I was thinking about something else anyway...

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing?
Kimiya: Lately, I've been studying something called "Alchemical Divination."
Kimiya: You rely on intuition to randomly choose some things to conduct alchemy on. If it fails — and, of course, most of the time it does fail — the ashes are used in divination.
Kimiya: It's pretty much the same principle as divination of coffee grounds or leftover tea leaves.
Kimiya: I've noticed that the girls in my class are really interested in that sort of thing, so there's no reason that Alchemical Divination shouldn't be just as popular, right?

Traveler: See you.
Kimiya: Ugh, but why?

## Talk

Traveler: Is this a personal interest or is it purely academic?
Kimiya: Ahem... Can't it be both?
Kimiya: My mentor kept shaking their head after I said that according to legend, Alchemical Divination was invented by Lesser Lord Kusanali. But I don't think it's time to give up yet.
Kimiya: I just need to work out the rationale for this interpretation, even the tiniest one. Then I can go back and discuss it with my mentor!

Traveler: Is this interest personal or academic?
Kimiya: Ahem... Can't it be both?
Kimiya: When I said that "legends hold that this was invented by Lesser Lord Kusanali," my mentor did have a doubtful look, but I didn't get rejected outright, so I reckon that it's too early to give up yet!
Kimiya: I just need to work out some rationale for this interpretation, even if it's a flimsy one. Then I can go back and discuss it with my mentor!
