Traveler: Tell me a little about yourself, please...
Xu Liushi: I'm the lookout on this here boat, Xu Liushi. That I've achieved all I have is thanks to Captain Beidou taking me in and instructing me.
Xu Liushi: *sigh* I mean, you know the thing that happened to me at Third-Round Knockout.
Xu Liushi: That's what you get for being young and stupid, and losing a bet with some folks. I had three bowls of them wine-fermented sweet rice balls in a row... Got so plastered that I fell off the ship and into the sea, right as we were weighing anchor.
Xu Liushi: No one wanted a sailor too deep into his bottle â€” only Captain Beidou was willing to give me a chance to turn over a new leaf.
Xu Liushi: ...And that's how it happened. I hope my story can serve as a lesson to you, traveler.
