Traveler: About Stormterror...
Flora: I was honestly more frightened by the storm that surrounded Mondstadt than Stormterror.
Flora: Everyone's been focused on the losses to people and property, but I'm still more concerned about the plants and flowers.
Flora: I'll protect them, just like how Lord Barbatos protects us.
