# Talk Group: ActivityGroup - 2008

## Talk 0

Watanabe: Ugh! I failed again... The disgrace of it!
Traveler: Tell me about the Tenryou Commission...
Watanabe: As you can see, the times have changed. The Tenryou Commission is currently redeploying its defenses all across Inazuma.
Watanabe: Though we're not as efficient or brave as Madam Kujou Sara makes us out to be, we spare no effort in protecting Inazuma and stopping these monsters from ravaging the land...

## Talk 1

Watanabe: I knew we could count on Madam Kujou Sara! The reinforcements she sent are all seasoned veterans!
Watanabe: With experienced fighters on hand, no amount of monsters can breach this pass!
Traveler: About your wounds...
Watanabe: Ha, nothing more than a scratch! Tenryou Commission samurai don't back down in critical moments like these!
Paimon: What a valiant spirit! No wonder people are starting to feel more at ease!

## Talk 2

Watanabe: The situation seems to be stabilizing... Madam Kujou Sara won't feel pressured to take action.
Watanabe: No need to rush. We'll launch a general offensive as soon as Madam Kujou Sara finishes with her business in the city, and take down this Domain in one go!
Paimon: We should hurry, they seem pretty amped up...

## Talk 3

Shiki Taishou: Those who seek ultimate attainment, can find it in practices of this Mystic Onmyou Chamber.
Shiki Taishou: Of course, rushing straight for the strongest opponent may set you back. Know yourself, and proceed in accordance with your abilities.
