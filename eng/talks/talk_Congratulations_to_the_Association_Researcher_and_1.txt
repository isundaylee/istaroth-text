Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Congratulations to the Association Researcher and part-time Courier Hoa for successfully excavating an ancient Qucusaurus dragon object!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Based on our analysis, the ancient dragon object she found was a saddle used by the people on the territory of the Flower-Feather Clan to stay firmly secured on their Qucusaurus mounts while diving."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "I just accidentally tripped and fell while delivering a letter, straight up cratered. I only found it because it was the thing I tripped over..."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Are you sure it isn't just... something some Qucusaur Rider lost recently?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Please trust the Association's judgment, as well as the instruments used to determine the age of the ancient dragon object..."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "In addition, even if this was equipment lost by some Rider... Just how badly would the Knight and Qucusaur have had to fall to bury the saddle that deep?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "So was my fall not bad enough then? I remember the Association's rules. Researchers must be compensated for work-related injuries..."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Where's my Mora!"
