Traveler: Any recommendations?
Sanguinetti: You can try some Fontainian Foie Gras alongside this red wine blend of Sassica and Ornella, produced on Erinnyes.
Sanguinetti: This wine is naturally sweet and carries a slightly sour note, while its fruity flavors stand out to balance out the fatty flavor, rounding it out and making it even more elegant.
Sanguinetti: Finally, allow its silky finish to fill your senses with the fragrance of roasted Figs and Sweet Flowers as a parting gift.
Sanguinetti: Those revelers who raise their champagnes in toast can never appreciate such beauty.
