# Delicious Lambad Fish Roll

A grilled fish dish with a faint floral scent. The rolling golden fish meat and fragrant rose petals remind you of the billowing waves on the sea surface, colored crimson by the setting sun. You see why the dish is also called "the Romance of Sailors." Wâ€”Wait just a minute! Does this mean that Lambad's adventure stories are not exaggerated after all?
