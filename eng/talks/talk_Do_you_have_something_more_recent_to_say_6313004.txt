Traveler: ...Do you have something more recent to say?
Shirai: Huh... Looks like this batch isn't good enough for you.
Shirai: Well, how about this, then? Did you know? The ancient god who rules over Liyue lost his life in an unfortunate incident during the annual Rite of Descension!
Shirai: It all happened so suddenly, and the Rite of Descension suddenly turned into the Rite of Parting. Was it a natural disaster? Or some kind of plot?
Shirai: Would you like to know more? Well, if you're curious, then you've gotta show your appreciation for such detailed intel, you know?
