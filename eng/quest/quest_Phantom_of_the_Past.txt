# Phantom of the Past


## Talk 1

Paimon: Ha... This tent doesn't look like it belongs to Diluc. Maybe it's an adventurer camp?
Paimon: Oh, there's a piece of paper and a notebook over there. Let's read them.
Investigate: "Dear Darknight Hero, we are seeing a repeat of the phenomenon we encountered many years ago."
Investigate: "Although you fully resolved the issue last time, the ley lines seem to have been stimulated in some way and are releasing the monsters they recorded once more."
Investigate: "I'm sure you'll want to deal with those that pose the biggest threat immediately."
Investigate: "So I'm notifying essential individuals, per the operating procedures."
Paimon: Hmm... judging by the tone, it seems like this was written by someone Diluc knows well. Let's call him "Diluc's friend" for now.
Paimon: He saw something bad happen, wrote a note for Master Diluc, and then left.
Paimon: Huh... Isn't that pretty irresponsible? What if someone else had seen it? Also, he left his notebook behind...
Paimon: Mmm... Now that Paimon thinks about it... you know that strange ley line deposit on the beach?
Traveler: I bet that's the "phenomenon" he was talking about.
Paimon: Other than that, everything seems fine here... not a monster in sight.
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, do you wanna read Diluc's friend's notebook, too?
Paimon: If not, let's head over and take a closer look at the ley line deposit.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Whoa! Where did all these monsters come from!?
Paimon: Uh.. Wait a second... Is that Diluc?
Paimon: Huh... He looks kinda different than usual...
Paimon: Look at him go! So focused and full of energy! So this is Captain Pyro when he's in top form, huh!
Traveler: It must be Diluc from when he fought here in the past.
Paimon: Hey, you're right! Now that Paimon looks more closely, this Diluc does look younger than usual.
Paimon: But what happened back then? Why was he fighting here?
Paimon: Hmm. Guess we can just ask him about it when we see him.
Paimon: #What should we do now, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: We shouldn't act rashly.
Paimon: Okay, let's see how young Diluc used to fight.
Traveler: Let's observe for now.
Traveler: The ley lines are showing the scene they recorded at that time.

## Talk 3

Paimon: The fight is over. Diluc wiped the floor with them... Guess some things haven't changed.
Paimon: So is there any actual danger here? It looks like it's only these illusions from the past.
Traveler: Diluc must have already been here.
Paimon: So, Diluc's already called it a day?
Paimon: Will more monsters come out if we go up to that weird ley line deposit again? And what about young Diluc?
Paimon: If it's like the other ley line deposits we've seen, then it should've disappeared now that all the monsters are defeated.
Traveler: So young Diluc's piqued your interest?
Paimon: No, no, hehe, Paimon's just a little worried is all.
Paimon: What if someone passing by gets curious, comes to check it out, then suddenly "Yaah!" A monster jumps out and clubs him over the head with a "swish" and a "smash"? That would be terrible.
Traveler: ...Why the sound effects?
Paimon: ...Because it sounds more dangerous that way!
Paimon: Anyway, we came here to help Diluc, didn't we? So let's stick around a little longer and make sure this place is completely safe before we head back.
Traveler: You've got a strong sense of responsibility.
Paimon: Hehe... Not really. Paimon just wants some fancy grape juice.
Paimon: #Come on, {NICKNAME}, let's finish what we came for. When we get the grape juice, you can have some of Paimon's half!
Traveler: Or have you suddenly developed an interest in ley line anomalies?
Traveler: At most, there might be a few remnants left.

## Talk 4

Adelinde: Good day to you both. It's been quite a long time. You're looking well, as ever.
Paimon: Hi, Adelinde!
Adelinde: To what do we owe the honor today? Important business to discuss with Master Diluc, I presume?
Traveler: Grape juice, actually...
Paimon: That's right. Adelinde, since we've run into you, maybe we could just get you to help us with this one?
Paimon: We always miss the Winery's discount grape juice, so this time we decided to come here early...
Paimon: Can you reserve a bottle for us? We'll pay a deposit, just name the price!
Adelinde: Of course I can, and no deposit necessary!
Adelinde: But I'm afraid you may be in for quite a wait. Dawn Winery's discount grape juice takes a long time to make.
Adelinde: Every summer, Master Diluc hand-picks two barrels of the finest grapes to turn into juice.
Paimon: What? Why sell the good stuff at a low price? Shouldn't the best grapes be the most expensive?
Adelinde: Master has never explained his reasoning. If I had to guess...
Adelinde: The discount could be a marketing technique. Special deals always attract customers.
Adelinde: Perhaps Master hopes to increase the popularity of fruit juice, so that people have more options when it comes to drinking.
Adelinde: It makes an ideal alternative for the heaviest drinkers, because they won't get drunk and start causing mischief. At the same time, those who don't drink alcohol get the chance to try something new.
Traveler: Wouldn't that harm the Winery's business...?
Adelinde: Master Diluc isn't all about money. I think he would prefer to see people drinking in moderation than chase bigger profits at any cost.
Adelinde: Imagine if everyone could just enjoy a nice glass of wine and have a good time while keeping their wits about them and not creating trouble for others... Now wouldn't that be a miracle?
Paimon: Wow, Master Diluc's such a thoughtful guy...
Paimon: So, is Diluc picking out this year's grapes right now?
Adelinde: Not just yet. He has a few more issues to sort out first. He'll start the process as soon as those are out of the way.
Adelinde: If you're interested, I'm sure Master Diluc would be delighted to see you and hear your thoughts.
Traveler: What "issues"?
Adelinde: As you know, whenever Master Diluc catches wind of any unsavory guests showing up in Mondstadt, he takes it upon himself to go and, ahem, "greet" them in person. It's the same story today.
Adelinde: He should be somewhere near Falcon Coast. I'm not sure how long he'll be... In the meantime, would you like to take a seat inside?
Adelinde: I have to stay here and wait for some other guests, but Hillie and Moco will be glad to take care of you.
Paimon: "Unsavory guests"? What is that supposed to mean...?
Traveler: Guessing it has something to do with Diluc's part-time job.
Paimon: Huh? You mean the Darkn—
Paimon: Uhhhh... the dark 'n' evil Abyss Order are up to no good again?
Paimon: In that case — Master Diluc's our friend, we can't sit here and do nothing!
Adelinde: If you're happy to help, that would be wonderful. Master trusts you, after all, and you're both very capable.
Adelinde: I know he'd appreciate a helping hand.
Paimon: No biggie! The sooner Master Diluc is free, the sooner we can get a taste of that delicious grape juice, hehe.
Paimon: #Come on, {NICKNAME}, let's go to the Falcon Coast!
Traveler: Alright, we'll wait inside until Diluc gets back.
Paimon: Ummm... But Paimon will feel kinda bad if we're sitting in Diluc's house twiddling our thumbs while he's out there hard at work.
Paimon: Let's go to Falcon Coast and help Diluc sort out his issues.
Paimon: Although Diluc is super strong, surely he'd appreciate a little support.
Traveler: It still doesn't sound like the most profitable venture.
Traveler: Not quite "important business"...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Adelinde: Please send Master Diluc my regards when you find him.
Adelinde: Also, do be careful out there.
Adelinde: As Master always says, "Even when the odds of success are nine to one, you must never lower your guard."
