Nolette: *panting* Let's put a few more hours in today...

## Talk

Traveler: Need a hand?
Nolette: Help? No, no, that wouldn't do. It should be me helping you — I was one of the Palais Mermonia's Gardes, you know, albeit retired now...
Nolette: And even so, I'm still hale and hearty — why, if a thief were to run by me, I would catch them for sure!

## Talk

Traveler: Are you alright?
Nolette: Of course I am. Not long ago, in fact, I helped solve a case — I'm not rusty yet, not by a long shot!

## Talk

Traveler: Rest well, then.
Nolette: Hmph. I could do this for another 10 hours, no problem!

## Talk

Traveler: What sort of case was that?
Nolette: *sigh* Actually, I spotted a photographer doing business at the plaza some time back, and I went to have a picture taken.
Nolette: I walked about until dinner time, and when I was about to eat, I felt someone touch my wallet! Shame that the kid was too quick, though — I couldn't keep up...
Nolette: But just the next day, one of my juniors came up to me and told me that the wallet had been retrieved — and indeed, the photo taken of me had helped to crack a big case!
Nolette: *sigh* It saddens me to say this, but I didn't really help much... If I had been fast enough to catch that fellow then...
Nolette: *cough* Don't worry about me, though. My bones are still sturdy! I'll get him next time...
