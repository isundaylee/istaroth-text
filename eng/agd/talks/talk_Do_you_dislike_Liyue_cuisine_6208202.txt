Freki: Do you dislike Liyue cuisine?
Freki: It's not that I dislike it, let's just say that I'm... disappointed.
Freki: Take Zhongyuan Chop Suey, for example. All the spices they use completely overwhelm the natural flavor of the ingredients. Apart from the powerful spicy and salty flavors, there is no taste of the actual ingredients.
Freki: I had anticipated that it would be a more shocking taste, but I didn't at all expect this.
Freki: We'll consult the Teyvat Travel Guide again to see where we should head next on our culinary journey.
