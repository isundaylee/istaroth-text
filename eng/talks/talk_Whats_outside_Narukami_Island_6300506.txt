Traveler: What's outside Narukami Island?
Furuya Noboru: Outside of Narukami Island, if you keep going southwest, you will find Kannazuka, Tatarasuna and Yashiori Island.
Furuya Noboru: These islands have been the focus of recent military conflicts, and I don't recommend that adventurers go there alone. However, many could not resist the temptation of treasure hunting... *cough*
Furuya Noboru: In addition, I haven't heard much good about the Mikage Furnace of Tatarasuna at Kannazuka... Anyway, those who can't handle themselves well had best stay away from these places for now.
Furuya Noboru: After passing through these islands, you will find yourself in the most remote corner of Inazuma, Watatsumi Island, a place under the jurisdiction of the Sangonomiya.
Furuya Noboru: Further down... you will be in southern Inazuma. This is a place that is constantly shrouded by fog. It sure doesn't look like anything good from this side of the ocean...
Furuya Noboru: While I'm curious about what exactly is hiding in the thick fog, I wouldn't suggest going there.
