Uncle Sun: Ah, another patron! Would you like to purchase some fish?
Uncle Sun: Things are different during Lantern Rite, let me tell you. Everything's super fresh! Lantern Rite-special-super-fresh, in fact!
Uncle Sun: It is the festive season, after all! People buy more, we import more, and the fish are all the fresher for it. Wouldn't you agree?

Uncle Sun: What do you mean by "super fresh"?
Uncle Sun: The only fish that I sell here are "super fresh" fish.
Uncle Sun: It might not sound like there's much difference between fresh and super fresh, but they couldn't be more different. In terms of size, or quality, you name it. They're worlds apart!
Uncle Sun: And I can guarantee one thing for sure: my prices are better than the opposite stand over there.
Uncle Sun: The opposite stand...
Uncle Sun: *sigh* You see, not long ago we were both charging higher prices, but my fish were selling better because they were more fresh.
Uncle Sun: Then, Uncle Gao started lowering his prices, probably just jealous of all the business I was getting. Before I knew it, I was stuck in a price war with him.
Uncle Sun: So in order to provide fresh fish to everyone at a reasonable price, I decided to lower my prices to just breaking even...
Uncle Sun: *sigh* I don't know how long I can keep my prices so low. I can only count on the support of all my local customers at this point.

Uncle Gao: How was business today, brother?
Uncle Sun: Here, let's just say this is a token of my appreciation, all thanks to your plan!
Uncle Gao: Haw-haw, they won't suspect a thing. This is all going just as I planned it would.
Uncle Sun: That's my Uncle Gao! There's no way anyone would ever remotely suspect that we're in cahoots. As soon as they compare our prices, they'll surely think that I'm the only one getting any business.
Uncle Gao: Hahaha! Come now, Uncle Sun! Bottoms up!
Uncle Sun: Here, let me fill that up for ya!
Uncle Gao: Aye! Tonight will be a night that we never remember, hahaha!
Uncle Sun: Enough talking, now drink up!
