# Wolves' Territory


## Talk 1

Paimon: This is Wolvendom. People from Mondstadt hardly ever come here...
Paimon: Even though it's not so far away from the city, the environment here is totally untouched. It's a wild place ruled by the laws of nature.
Paimon: It's survival of the fittest out here. Even the slimes around here are huuuge!
Paimon: ...Like those super-duper massive ones over there!
Traveler: ...Eek, they've seen us! Prepare for battle!

## Talk 2

Razor: ...You really want to help?
Razor: Wolves hunt on instinct. Works every time. But... setting trap sounds fun.
Razor: First, we set trap. Next, chase boar in — yes?
Razor: Hope it won't explode...

## Talk 3

Paimon: *panting* Th—Thank you— Aaah! Wolves! Ruuuun!
Razor (???): Do not worry. Wolves friends. But, you are...?
Paimon: We're just some boring old travelers passing through...
Razor (???): Don't smell boring. You smell... *sniff* familiar...
Paimon: ...We smell?
Razor (???): You smell like Knights of Favonius. They are friends.
Traveler: What's your name?
Razor: I am Razor.
Paimon: Are you one of the Knights of Favonius too?
Razor: I am not.
Paimon: Huh?
Traveler: What's with the wolf pack?
Razor: My wolf pack... they are my family.
Paimon: ...Your family!?
Razor: Yes. They raised me. We live together. We are family.
Paimon: So many questions...
Razor: They are angry with me. I help you, exposed our ambush, boar ran away.
Paimon: #Oh, ah... don't worry, Paimon will get Traveler to catch you another boar.
Paimon: #Traveler is stronger than he looks.
Razor: N—No need. When knights try to help, wolves go hungry...
Paimon: Don't be silly! Wait here — we won't screw this up, just watch!
Traveler: Are you also one of the Knights?
Razor: I am Razor. I am no knight.

Razor: Hope it won't explode...

## Talk 5

Paimon: Haha! Told you we could do it!
Razor: I— thanks, but...
Razor: ...Wolves catch five or six every hunt... *sigh* Tonight, they go hungry...
Paimon: Uh-oh...
Razor: Don't worry. You tried.
Razor: At least you did better than other knight friend... the red one, burny girl.
Razor: If she was here, whole mountain is fire. Can't catch even one boar.
Razor: I must go now.
Razor: Here is not safe. Careful. Always watching.
Paimon: What a weirdo...
Paimon: "Burny girl"? From the Knights of Favonius? What is he—
Paimon: #Traveler, who do you think it is?
