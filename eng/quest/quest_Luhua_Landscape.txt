# Luhua Landscape


## Talk 1

Vermeer: This isn't right... This can't be right. Those statues' eyes don't light up...
Vermeer: Is my viewfinding technique wrong somehow? No, that can't be it...
Vermeer: Eyes... What eyes? This statue doesn't have any at all.

## Talk 2

Vermeer: Oh, this is terrible. How will I paint like this...?
Traveler: What's wrong?
Vermeer: You... Oh, it's you, Traveler. Well, here's the problem: I've been looking for inspiration around the Luhua Pool, and I wanted to paint a few pictures to bring back with me.
Vermeer: But I haven't been able to find a good angle, and so none of my paintings have been to my satisfaction.
Vermeer: I was so focused on taking the scenery in that I only realized that most of my paintbrushes and paints had gone missing when I arrived here.
Vermeer: I must have left them in the previous posts where I'd painted pictures. Could you help me look for them?
Traveler: Where did you paint those pictures?
Vermeer: Uh, actually... I don't quite remember myself. I was too engrossed in my painting each time to pay my surroundings much mind, so I can't give you very specific locations...
Vermeer: But I've only drawn two pictures in this area, so it can only be in those two places.
Vermeer: I'll give you these two paintings. I'm sure that I must have left my painting tools in the areas I was <color=#00E1FFFF>using as a reference</color> for those paintings.
Vermeer: Once you've found them, please bring them back to me. I'll keep looking around here... I'm sure there's a better angle to take.
Traveler: But where do I start?
Vermeer: I was too engrossed in my surroundings each time to pay attention to my surroundings, so I can't remember any specifics...
Vermeer: But I've only painted two pictures in this area, so it can only be in those two places.

## Talk 3

Vermeer: Have you found my painting tools?
Traveler: Found them.
Vermeer: Just as I thought, I left them in the place I was taking references from. I tend to put the things I've used on the ground while I paint out of habit.
Vermeer: When I'm in too much of a rush, I tend to leave a lot of things behind. Thank you so much. If not for you, I'd have to go back into the city to buy more.
Traveler: You're going to continue painting here?
Vermeer: Don't even mention it. I'd heard people say that these two statues have eyes that could light up, and that you could see that from afar.
Vermeer: Giant statues with blazing eyes, standing guard next to a mountain... It would surely have made an excellent painting.
Vermeer: But when I came here, the statues were here, but there were no shining eyes to be found.
Vermeer: I thought that I might have missed some special timing, or that my angle was off, which is why I've been walking around.
Vermeer: But it seems that no matter where I stand, the scenery doesn't change...
Vermeer: The only thing I've gotten out of the whole venture is this — I found it in the pond down there.
Vermeer: I have no clue what it is, but the more I look at it, the more it resembles an eye.
Vermeer: But if this is an eye, then there might be another similar rock nearby. People do have two eyes, after all...
Vermeer: *sigh* That's my conjecture, anyway. Don't think too hard about it. This rock's of little use to me, anyway, so why don't you have it? Consider it thanks for helping me find my tools.
Vermeer: Statues with shining eyes... I wonder what secrets one can uncover in Luhua Pool?

## Talk 4

Mysterious Statue: (This statue's head has a hole in a head, and it seems something may be inserted into it...)
Traveler: Insert

Vermeer: The only thing I've gotten out of the whole venture is this — I found it in the pond down there...
Traveler: Hmm, I found one too...
Vermeer: Did you? Let me have a look. Why, I never — they're identical.
Vermeer: Strange. There are even words carved into the back. Now, what do they say...
Vermeer: "The stone sentinels hold the gate as such, against those who add not a finishing touch..." What does this mean?
Vermeer: Well, this rock's of little use to me, anyway, so why don't you have it? Consider it thanks for helping me find my tools.
Vermeer: Actually, I have a thought. It's just a wild guess, but don't you think these two rocks look a bit like eyes?
Vermeer: If they really are eyes, do you think that the "finishing touch" has something to do with these two stones.
Vermeer: Well, it's just a guess, so don't think too hard about it. I'm going to look for other views, now — thanks for finding my tools for me!

## Talk 8

Vermeer: How will I find that one perfect view...
Traveler: Regarding that rock...
Vermeer: About the rock? Why are you suddenly interested in that?
Vermeer: I picked it up while looking for a good view at <color=#00E1FFFF>Luhua Pool</color>.
Vermeer: Do you want to go to <color=#00E1FFFF>Luhua Pool</color> to have a look?
Vermeer: You'll have to keep a close eye out. There're all sorts of things in that pool, and I have no idea who threw it in there...

## Talk 9

Vermeer: I should bring more materials to paint with next time...
Vermeer: Or maybe I should keep a memo of the things I lose instead...

## Talk 10

Vermeer: Oh... So that's how it is! These two rocks really are the eyes of the two statues. Their eyes will only shine once you've slotted those stones in...
Vermeer: Looks like I'll be able to paint something great after all! I'm off to find a good angle! Thank you so much!
Vermeer: Wonderful, absolutely wonderful...
