# Crash Course on Inazuman Fashion


## Talk 1

Ogura Mio: This is no way to continue doing business...
Traveler: Is something the matter?
Ogura Mio: Ah, I'm sorry. I was just a little lost in my own thoughts. Are you here to buy some clothes?
Ogura Mio: The high-class silks from Liyue remain out of stock, but we still have the latest kimonos.
Traveler: You used to import material from Liyue?
Ogura Mio: Yes. Before, we were often able to secure high-end silk from Liyue such as those that the Feiyun Commerce Guild makes from Silk Flowers.
Ogura Mio: But with the current situation here, we haven't been able to import that sort of silk in a while now. We've been having to rely on our existing stock to continue operations.
Ogura Mio: Every bolt of silk we use here is one we're not getting back...
Ogura Mio: I originally planned to design some novel kimono patterns myself, or use some new dyes to make new cloth and attract customers.
Ogura Mio: But I can't think of anything that might be considered a "novel" pattern...
Ogura Mio: Traveler, you've seen a lot, I'm sure. Have you encountered any designs that you might consider "novel"?
Traveler: I wouldn't say so, exactly...
Ogura Mio: Ah, I see. Um, this might be rather presumptuous of me, but... could you help me ask other outlanders about patterns that we could use?
Ogura Mio: I'm the only one running Ogura Textiles & Kimonos at the moment, so I can't leave the store. If I want to gather information, I can only ask others to do it for me.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Ogura Mio: Great, let me think... You should go ask Miss Tang Wen and Mr. Ramsay. Perhaps they will have some new ideas.

## Talk 2

Ogura Mio: Perhaps Miss Tang Wen and Mr. Ramsay will have some new ideas...

## Talk 3

Traveler: So, do you have any ideas for kimono patterns?
Tang Wen: Kimono patterns? I'm afraid I don't know anything about that...
Tang Wen: But if you were to ask me... I think that books might look great as a design on a kimono.
Tang Wen: Hmm, books printed on kimonos... Now wouldn't that be interesting...

## Talk 4

Traveler: So, do you have any ideas for kimono patterns?
Ramsay: Kimono patterns? Haha, I'm not exactly an expert on that.
Ramsay: But if I were to choose a design, I'd go with tea sets. Those would look neat on a kimono.
Ramsay: A kimono printed with a tea set design... Hahaha, now that certainly would have an Inazuman feel.

Traveler: You used to import material from Liyue?
Ogura Mio: Yes. Before, we were often able to secure high-end silk from Liyue such as those that the Feiyun Commerce Guild makes from Silk Flowers.
Ogura Mio: But at the moment, we have yet to reestablish connections with our suppliers, so we can only work with the stock we still have.
Ogura Mio: As such, every bolt of silk we use here is one we're not getting back...
Ogura Mio: I originally planned to design some novel kimono patterns myself, or use some new dyes to make new cloth and attract customers.
Ogura Mio: Traveler, I'm sure that you've seen a great deal in your journeys. May I ask if you've ever encountered any designs that you might consider "novel"?
Traveler: I wouldn't say so, exactly...
Ogura Mio: Ah, I see. Um, this might be rather presumptuous of me, but... could you help me ask other outlanders about for ideas about patterns that we might use in our designs?
