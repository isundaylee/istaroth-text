Traveler: How do you like it here?
Neuvillette: The scenery here is pleasant. It makes one feel happy.
Neuvillette: But I've been meaning to ask, does it never rain here?
Traveler: No, never.
Neuvillette: I see.
Neuvillette: Well, I suppose that makes sense... Worlds such as this are created as a sanctuary from wind and rain.
Neuvillette: Pay it no heed... it's nothing.
Traveler: But we do have Inazuman hot springs here.
Neuvillette: Oh, splendid.
Neuvillette: I've long heard tell of the hot springs in Inazuma. Did not expect that I'd see them here.
Neuvillette: Hm? You mean the water is just artificially heated?
Neuvillette: That's quite understandable. Even long ago, I had heard that there are no natural hot springs in Inazuma either, and that their current facilities were imported and developed by their treasury department.
Neuvillette: The experience is not much different from that of an authentic, natural hot spring.
