Traveler: Tell me about the performances...
Leone: If I had to recommend something, it would be the magic show by the Great Magician Lyney and Lynette.
Leone: Their magic is truly a thing of surpassing beauty, and they also have many unexpected ideas!
Leone: That said, their performance times are as unpredictable as their magic tricks.
Leone: You would be very fortunate to meet them indeed.
