Geri: Who are you?
Geri: My name is Geri. My sister Freki and I are "bon vivant" travelers in search of fine cuisine. Our aim is to taste and see all that the seven nations have to offer.
Geri: But we never expected to meet such an unprecedented challenge on our very first stop of the trip...
Geri: The people of Liyue are so unpleasant.
