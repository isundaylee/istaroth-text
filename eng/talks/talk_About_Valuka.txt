Traveler: About Valuka...
Arakara: Valuka is different from Vana. All the earth has turned into golden remains.
Arakara: No Aranara have been there, not even Aradasha.
Arakara: But I heard there are Nara farming in Valuka. I wonder how do the Nara there make the flowers happy.
Arakara: #If Nara {NICKNAME} goes to Valuka someday, can you ask the Nara there about this for me?
