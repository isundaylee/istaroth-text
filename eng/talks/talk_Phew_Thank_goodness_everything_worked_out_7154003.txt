# Talk Dialog

Lan Yan: Phew... Thank goodness everything worked out...
Traveler: Lan Yan, this gift envelope is for you.
Lan Yan: #For me? Thank you, Traveler, it's beautiful!
Traveler: Wishing you all the best in the new year.
Lan Yan: Likewise! I hope this year treats you well!
Lan Yan: Although... I'm sure you're someone who can take that into your own hands.
Lan Yan: I have no doubt that you can turn any bad situation on its head.
Traveler: I try my best.
Lan Yan: As expected of the great hero of Liyue and the esteemed guest of the Tianquan â€” your words exude confidence.
Lan Yan: Anyway, you and Hu Tao solved the problem with the border, and now my grandpa doesn't need to worry about getting yelled at because of his fortunes.
Lan Yan: In that sense, I guess this year's Lantern Rite was a huge success!
Lan Yan: I wish you health, success, and happiness in the new year!
Traveler: If I set my mind to it, of course.
Traveler: See you.
Lan Yan: Bye! Happy Lantern Rite!
