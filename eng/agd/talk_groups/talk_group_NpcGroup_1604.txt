Traveler: Who's that person?
Herman: Huh, have you... never heard of the adventurer Herman before?
Herman: ...No, this must be your way provoking me to make a comeback. I've already seen through you!
Herman: It's a shame. As I am now, all I can do is provide younger adventurers like you with snippets of my experience. I don't go out on adventures anymore.

## Talk

Traveler: I never said I was looking for you...
Herman: Oh I see, I misunderstood. I thought you were another one of these who'd heard my story and came here to harass me about it.
Herman: Look, whatever stories you've heard about Herman the adventurer, don't believe a word! ...Even the ones that are true.
Herman: Because I'm not the same person anymore. No more starry-eyed "ad astra" adventurer for me; the only thing that catches my eye now is my wife. And no more conquering the abyss â€” not when I've got a daughter to deal with!
Herman: So long as they are in my life, I don't have the right to tempt fate by going on adventures anymore.

Herman: Wagner's swords are all so expensive... *sigh*

## Talk

Traveler: You are...?
Herman: Who, me? Sorry, you must have the wrong guy; I'm certainly not who you're looking for.
Herman: I'm just an ordinary dad on his way to the shops. See? Ordinary as can be.

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing?
Herman: My baby girl Ellin is almost old enough to sign up with the Knights of Favonius now. It's what she's always wanted to do...
Herman: I was going to give her a sword for her birthday this year, but it's so expensive...
Herman: Maybe it's true that I've got nothing left going for me now I'm not an adventurer...
Herman: Especially now I've spent the last of the Mora I made when I forced myself to sell my trusty sword, Cool Steel, all those years ago...

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Herman: Bye. If you come across a good way to make money, let me know. As long as it doesn't involve tempting fate, that is.

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Herman: Stormterror? Are you asking me to...
Herman: No, no way. I'm not making a comeback!
Herman: Look at me. I... I already have a wife and a child. I have a daughter now. The adventurer Herman has nothing to do with me anymore!
Herman: My life doesn't belong to me alone any longer. Even if it's for their sake, I won't go on another adventure...
