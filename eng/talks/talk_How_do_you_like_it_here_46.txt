Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Ganyu: I think it's beautiful here.
Ganyu: It must have been quite an undertaking to decorate such a large space. Thank you for all your efforts.
Traveler: Don't mention it.
Ganyu: In my spare time, I particularly enjoy taking strolls outside. It's so quiet and peaceful.
Ganyu: Even at midday, it's perfectly safe to take a nap.
Traveler: Yes, you definitely don't need to worry about safety here...
Ganyu: Agreed! So I really do like it here.
Ganyu: Anyway, um... Thanks so much, once again!
Traveler: Take care to not catch a cold...
Ganyu: Please don't worry, I've slept like this every day for at least a thousand years.
Traveler: As long as you like it.
