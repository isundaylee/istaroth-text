Traveler: Good night, Gaming.
Gaming: Oh okay, night! You got enough blankets, yeah? Make sure you wrap up nice 'n' warm.
Gaming: If you can't get to sleep and need some company, lemme know! Whether there's stuff you wanna get off your mind, or you just wanna catch up on work, I'm down for hanging out.
Gaming: If you have a bad night, I'll make you an herbal tea tomorrow. No seriously, nighttime restlessness is all 'cause of heatiness, too.
