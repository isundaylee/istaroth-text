Shiho: Miu, are you feeling better?
Miu: Ohh, how could this have happened? Not only has the author Taiyaki's latest work been delayed by work, but "A Country From the Center of the Earth and a Bouquet for You" will also stop releasing temporarily!
Miu: But... But the two protagonists were just about to confess their feelings to each other at the end of the last volume!
Shiho: Calm down, Miu...
Miu: You don't understand! In the original series that Taiyaki's fan novel was based on, the two protagonists could not resolve their differences and separated!
Miu: I've... I've pinned all my hopes for their happiness onto Taiyaki!
Shiho: Um, well, if you wish for their happiness that much, why don't you write them a happy ending?
Miu: Me? ...Well, actually, you've got a point. Be the change we want to see and everything, you know?
