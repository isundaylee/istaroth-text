# Talk Dialog

Souka: Hmm? Fancy meeting you here, "Twin Stars of Brilliant Valor"!
Traveler: That's a pretty nice nickname!
Paimon: It's been a while, Souka!
Paimon: And there you go with the nicknames again... But Paimon likes this one — it's cool, and it also emphasizes our super-awesome partnership!
Souka: Ah, it's good that you like it.
Paimon: So the contestant Haniyyah mentioned was you, huh? Why're you here in Sumeru by yourself?
Souka: Well, I was looking to regain the mindset I previously had during the tournament...
Souka: I'm about one-third of the way through writing my new book, but I feel like some of the parts I've written after that aren't quite right...
Souka: As time passed, I found that the inspiration that I got and the feelings that I held toward our Fungi partners began to fade and cool.
Paimon: Well, no matter how good your memory is, you won't quite be able to capture the joy of traveling together if you're apart from your companions for too long.
Souka: Exactly! So I asked Lady Yae to allow me to come to Sumeru for a long-term attachment, and she gladly agreed — she even sent me here with a letter of recommendation!
Souka: I searched in the rainforest for some time before finally finding Haniyyah's campsite. It was really well hidden, and didn't startle any of the surrounding animals at all!
Souka: She is very capable, and she takes great care of the Fungi, but I can at least help her share her burden.
Souka: When she heard why I'd come, she agreed to my request. She then taught me quite a few survival lessons, and tutored me on how to take care of Fungi.
Souka: I mean, I already enjoyed living together with them, so every day has been quite fulfilling.
Souka: Inspiration's also close at hand, so I believe that the rest of this book will be a cinch!
Traveler: A perfect decision!
Paimon: That's great! You get endless inspiration for your new book, and Haniyyah gets to take some of the load off her back!
Paimon: Still, we haven't seen your partner anywhere.
Paimon: Paimon thinks it was... Stormstress?
Souka: Stormstress has been helping us set up a new hut, so it's resting at our campsite right now. That's why it didn't come along to Port Ormos.
Souka: The other contestants' Fungi partners are accompanying Stormstress. If the opportunity comes along, I can take you to our campsite to meet them all!
Souka: Look, Lady Yae's Blitzara and Layla's Twirly-Whirly are just over there. They'd love to play with you.
Paimon: Nice! Let's go meet up with our shroom friends later, then!
Traveler: Good for you!
Traveler: Sorry, uh, who are you again...
Paimon: #Have you not been resting well these last few days, {NICKNAME}? Do you need a refresher or something?
Paimon: Souka's one of Yae Publishing House's new writers. She came with Miko to take part in the tournament previously!
Paimon: We did beat her in the second round, but uh... Ahem, let's not dwell on that too much...
Paimon: After that, Souka wrote us into her light novel. We're pretty important characters, so Paimon's really looking forward to reading it!
Traveler: Aha, yes, now I remember!
Paimon: Right? You're not that forgetful!
Paimon: So the contestant Haniyyah mentioned was you, huh? Why're you here in Sumeru by yourself?
Souka: Well, I was looking to regain the mindset I previously had during the tournament...

Traveler: Good for you!
Traveler: Yes, yes, that did happen...
Traveler: We'll talk again later!
Souka: Indeed, it seems you bear the expectations of many, and are most busy indeed...
Souka: I hope to see you both again soon!
