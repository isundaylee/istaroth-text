Ifa's Message: "I hope you all remember to perform regular health checkups on yourself and your Saurian companions. Like humans, they can be quite obstinate at times."
Ifa's Message: "If you feel as though something is off during your daily interactions with them, please come in for a check-up immediately. Doctor Chuychu and I can both help out."
Ifa's Message: "I recommend Doctor Chuychu for human injuries. If a Saurian is injured, come find me."
Ifa's Message: "Anyway, don't be pig-headed. This applies to both humans and Saurians."
