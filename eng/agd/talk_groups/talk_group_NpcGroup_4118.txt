Vasco: Should I go to Fontaine and get a diving certificate?

Traveler: Diving certificate?
Vasco: Listen to me, don't underestimate the sea! I almost lost my life on the last voyage!
Vasco: I was so stoked back then, surveying the sea all day with a scope, trying not to miss anything.
Vasco: Finally, I spotted an uncharted island one day and coaxed the captain into making shore.
Vasco: It was when we got close that we realized it was the backside of a sea monster!
Vasco: We were chased by the awakened monster and had to follow the captain's order to start jettisoning.
Vasco: That included my luggage, all the food aboard, and... the cook.

Traveler: The cook?
Vasco: Listen to me. When you venture out to the sea, you don't want to be the heaviest person around!
Vasco: I'll skip the details, but you get it, right?
Vasco: Anyway, the captain "jettisoned" me, too, when we got back to the dock.
Vasco: To prevent myself from the cook's fate, I'm considering getting a diving certificate from Fontaine before adventuring again.
Vasco: But I heard the water in Fontaine is different from here, so it won't be a useful endeavor.
Vasco: Maybe I should just stay on land?

Traveler: I don't know...
Vasco: I understand. When you embark on an adventure, you can come across a variety of situations anywhere you go. And rainforests and deserts are infested with quite some strange things.
Vasco: But I'm not going to sea again anytime soon. I'll just wait and see.
Vasco: This bow is of little use to me now. Do you wish to take it?
Vasco: I thought ranged weapons like this might be useful at sea or on a deserted island, or even for bowfishing.
Vasco: Now that I think about it... Nah. Perhaps I should take it one step at a time and learn to use a dagger first.
