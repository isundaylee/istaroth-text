# Raiders Amidst Snow Mist


## Talk 1

Paimon: Albedo! We're back~!
Paimon: Oh, hey, does he have a guest over?
Traveler: Yes, and a familiar one at that.
Cyrus: Yes, perhaps it is too soon to ask our greenhorns to come adventuring here...
Cyrus: But adventure is nothing if it is not about pushing our limits! What is a journey without struggle, without excitement?
Cyrus: This place may be infested with wicked hilichurl bandits and knee-deep snow, but an adventurer must never stop pressing forward!
Albedo: Cyrus, to the point, please.
Cyrus: Hahaha! Come, come! The beauty of a chat lies in the journey, not the destination — just like an adventure!
Cyrus: Even if you are robbed blind and must give up on your encampment, you can start a fire and cook a meal in the frigid snow!
Cyrus: This journey up the mountain will be an unforgettable one for all our newcomers!
Albedo: Mm, yes.
Cyrus: They may resent me, or even hate me. But in the future, they will think back upon this moment with hearts full of gratitude — for this was the day that the spirit of adventure was passed on to them!
Albedo: Oh yes, go on.
Paimon: Oh brother... Albedo's at it again. He's always so cold when the topic doesn't catch his fancy...
Traveler: He isn't interested in adventurers in the slightest, is he?
Paimon: He sure is interested in you, though.
Cyrus: Still... should we say that our newcomers are too green, or that the mountain is too mighty? We have taken great losses this time...
Paimon: What? What do you mean, "great losses"?
Cyrus: Oh, you must be...
Traveler: What's up, Cyrus?
Paimon: Long time no see—!
Cyrus: #Ah, yes! The young adventurer and {M#his}{F#her} companion! It is my pleasure to see you here.
Cyrus: I trust these frigid ascents have not given you too much trouble?
Paimon: Ha, we can take anything it has to throw at us!
Cyrus: Hahaha! Good, good! I love your confidence!
Cyrus: But you must be here on some important duty, braving the wind and snow like this.
Albedo: #I came here to gather the latest data on hilichurls, and asked {M#him}{F#her} to serve as my assistant.
Traveler: (Huh. Is that how it went?)
Cyrus: Ah, I see. A gathering of people chasing their dreams and ideals, is it?
Cyrus: Then I wish you all the best. Farewell for now — I must go see to our new recruits.
Paimon: Haha, looks like we've made a discovery!
Traveler: Albedo is keeping Cyrus in the dark.
Paimon: Well, it is a magical sword after all. It's understandable that he doesn't want other people to know about it.
Albedo: I am listening, you know...
Traveler: Should I not ask?
Albedo: There is no "should" or "shouldn't" here. I can answer your questions...
Albedo: But not right now. Right now, I have more pressing matters on hand.
Paimon: "Pressing matters"? ...Let Paimon guess, we've got a part to play in it too, huh?
Albedo: Hehe. You're getting smarter, Paimon.
Paimon: Hey! Paimon will have you know that she's always been smart!
Albedo: I have discovered some new habitats nearby with different monster types. I believe they will provide us with similarly varied data.
Traveler: You sure love your research, don't you?
Albedo: Perseverance is key to research, and persistence is the basis of the alchemist's art.
Albedo: So, are you ready? Then let us go.
Traveler: (Quite reluctant to let people in on the matter of that sword, isn't he?)
Traveler: Now, where have we seen this face before?

## Talk 2

Albedo: Hmm. It seems that no one is here.
Paimon: Do monsters go out to run errands too?
Albedo: Well then, would you like to take a look around before they return, or shall we rest a while here?
Traveler: How does a rest and a leisurely talk sound?
Albedo: Just what I was thinking.
Paimon: So, we're having a chat now? Paimon wants in!
Albedo: I know you must have questions, whether it be about me, or about this entire situation. As I said before, I will answer them.
Albedo: But I will not deceive you. There are some things I cannot go into detail on. On these matters, you'll have to permit me to summarize a bit.
Paimon: Huh. Guess Albedo can be pretty straightforward when he wants to be...
Traveler: More earnest than I expected, for sure.
???: Tiga plata!
Paimon: Uh huh! ...Eh, what?
???: Odomu Movo!
Traveler: Are you making those strange noises, Albedo?
Albedo: Do you really think that's possible?
Traveler: Ah, hilichurls!
Traveler: Are you making those strange noises, Paimon?
Paimon: What do you think? And why aren't you asking Albedo, huh?
Traveler: More carefree than I expected, for sure.
Traveler: Great idea — I have some questions.
Albedo: ...
Albedo: Alright. What would you like to ask?

## Talk 3

Albedo: We must get the book back, it has my notes and sketches in it.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Albedo, how's the sketchbook situation?
Albedo: It's alright. A few pages were destroyed, but most of it is intact.
Albedo: The temperature in the Snowy Mountain is subzero. It can reach extremely low temperatures, especially near that cavern.
Albedo: What makes matters worse is that the hilichurls have drooled all over the pages. To leave wet paper in such low temperatures, it's too dreadful to imagine...
Paimon: Frozen paper is so brittle. It doesn't take much for it to fall apart, huh?
Traveler: Fortunately, you knew how to piece it back together.
Paimon: No wonder you're an alchemist! Such an ingenious mind!
Paimon: If the sketchbook had been severely damaged, you'd be furious, wouldn't you?
Albedo: What leads you to believe that?
Paimon: You told us there's a lot of drawings and notes inside.
Albedo: I must admit, I bring this sketchbook everywhere I go.
Albedo: However, I wouldn't fly into a rage over such a thing.
Albedo: Had I not been able to salvage it, I would just draw everything again.
Paimon: Eh... How pragmatic of you...
Traveler: I don't think so.
Albedo: Is that so?
Traveler: After all, you've put a lot of effort into your drawings.
Paimon: That's right!
Traveler: Think of all the memories you've committed to paper.
Paimon: Yep yep!
Traveler: Such mementos shouldn't be easily abandoned.
Paimon: #Absolutely! All well said. You took the words out of Paimon's mouth, {NICKNAME}.
Albedo: Hmm... You're right. Redrawing everything would be a tedious endeavor.
Paimon: Especially since you're so talented, right?
Paimon: You've mastered so many skills and gathered so much knowledge that other people can only dream of!
Paimon: But such talented people sometimes forget about that. It's one of the downsides of being smart, isn't it?
Traveler: Albedo's also praised your smarts, Paimon.
Albedo: Without a doubt, Paimon is an interesting creature.
Traveler: Paimon forgets about the little things, too?
Paimon: Ahhhh! Don't put Paimon on the spot when it comes to wisdom!
Albedo: Changing the subject... Cyrus told me that the hilichurls from this mountain attack and rob adventurers.
Albedo: The place we visited should be one of their camps.
Traveler: The hilichurls in this area are strong.
Paimon: Yeah, the hilichurls here are way stronger than the ones at the bottom of the mountain.
Albedo: I can't disagree. I assume... this must be related to the dragon.
Albedo: The corruptive power emanating from Durin's remains is making the monsters stronger, which, in tandem with the frigid climate, depopulated some mountain areas.
Albedo: Can you take out the sword, Traveler?
Albedo: Each time you fought in the mountains, this sword was absorbing power and storing it within itself.
Albedo: Moreover, thanks to your purification, the corruptive power of the dragon's blood seems to be all gone now.
Albedo: It's a very interesting phenomenon.
Paimon: It's not the first time we've done something like that. We're experts!
Albedo: I always wondered what purification was capable of... I knew you were capable of doing it, but seeing it with my own eyes is a unique experience.
Traveler: A power-absorbing sword must be quite dangerous.
Albedo: Indeed, I can't say it's the safest of weapons.
Paimon: Lucky that it wasn't snatched away by those hilichurls, otherwise we'd be done for!
Traveler: Aren't Fatui a bigger threat?
Paimon: Hilichurls are a threat, too! What if that power could turn them into... super, no, ultra hilichurls!
Traveler: Ultra hilichurls!
Paimon: Ultra demon hilichurls!
Traveler: Ultra demon snowman hilichurls!
Paimon: "Snowman"? Now you've ruined the game...
Paimon: Anyway, about the sword... If it's so powerful, can't it absorb your energy as well, Albedo?
Albedo: ...
Albedo: Would you like to try it out?
Paimon: Yikes! Such a cold gaze!
Traveler: Paimon was just joking...
Albedo: It's fine. After all, I still hope you'll continue to use this sword.
Paimon: You still trust us? Even though this sword is so dangerous? Well that was unexpected.
Paimon: Albedo, you say one thing but do another... Paimon can never tell what's really on your mind!
Albedo: I have no idea what you're talking about...
Albedo: But if you want to know why I trust you... It might be because...
Albedo: The "unusual" ones like us share a certain degree of understanding.
Traveler: Unusual ones?
Albedo: Lonely individuals... Those who aren't like ordinary people. Just like... you and me.
Traveler: (...?)
Traveler: (Is he implying something?)
Traveler: Paimon didn't mean anything bad...
Traveler: Aren't Treasure Horders a bigger threat?
Traveler: I don't think Paimon has the same problem.
Traveler: If that happened to me, I'd get mad!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Did you see that? That hilichurl ran off while holding on to something that looks like a book!
Albedo: That's... not good. That was my sketchbook.
Traveler: Perhaps it dreams of becoming a grand-master artist someday?
Paimon: Paimon thinks it's just your run-of-the-mill thief, really.
Albedo: To think that it dared to steal my sketchbook. Quite bold, this one.
Paimon: Hmm, looks like Albedo's got a frosty temper...
Traveler: I'll lend you a hand.
Traveler: Did it want to learn alchemy too?

## Talk 7

Albedo: The paths we may venture are not limited to those the eye can see.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Looks like it's a dead end. You know, except for this huge cavern entrance.
Traveler: Did it run in there?
Albedo: Judging from the tracks, that seems to be the case.
Paimon: Then what are we waiting for!? We can't let it escape!
Albedo: Wait.
Albedo: This mountain is incredibly large. Even if there was a path within its bowels, such a road would not be easy to walk.
Albedo: ...
Albedo: Can you feel it? The wind carries the scent of ice and stone with it... and the sound of echoes. The space within must be massive.
Paimon: R—Really?
Albedo: As such, rash moves are of no benefit to us.
Paimon: But... But we've come all this way — we can't just let it leave!
Traveler: Isn't that sketchbook very important to you?
Albedo: It is. But that doesn't mean that we should act recklessly.
Albedo: There is another way. It just requires some extra work.
Albedo: If my guess is correct, this cavern's exit is on the other side of the mountain.
Albedo: You are quite the expert glider, and I'm a fair hand myself. So prepare yourself, and we'll glide across in one go.
