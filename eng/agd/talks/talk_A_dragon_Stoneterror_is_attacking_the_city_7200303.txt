Traveler: A dragon, Stoneterror, is attacking the city!
Uncle Tian: ...A dragon, you say?
Uncle Tian: Well don't just stand there, call the Milibands! ...The Band of Mili-Men, you know? Or was it the Mili-Band of Brothers? The Knights that Mill Around, maybe?
Uncle Tian: *sigh* I can't remember what they're called. I'll probably just fish here a while longer then go back home...
