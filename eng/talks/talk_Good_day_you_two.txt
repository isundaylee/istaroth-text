Fushizome: Good day, you two.
Fushizome: Are you interested in the art of ikebana?
Traveler: "Ikebana"?
Paimon: Huh, Paimon feels like we've heard about this one before...
Fushizome: That's wonderful.
Fushizome: I am currently organizing an event to show off the wonders of ikebana.
Fushizome: In a few days, you, too, will be able to experience its charm.
Traveler: Oh, now I'm curious...
Paimon: Alrighty, we'll come back in a couple of days, then!
Traveler: I might be... at some point.
Fushizome: Well then, you can come down here in a few days to try ikebana out for yourself. Perhaps you, too, will be charmed by this art.
