Traveler: Who's "he," if I might ask?
Kanra: Ah, I'm talking about my lover. He is now serving as a soldier in Tatarasuna.
Kanra: I've written letters to him before, asking if he was doing well... But somehow none of these letters got a reply.
Kanra: I don't really have any other way to contact him, so I can only pray for him here. I hope that the archon will bless him and keep him safe...
