# Purbiruni's Commandment


## Talk 1

Sadife: Thanks again for your help, and please do not hesitate to reach out in case you need anything.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Okay, since we're already at the Akademiya... why not try looking for some of the Purbiruni mentioned by Khedive? But where should we start...

## Talk 3

Dara: Whoa! Stop! Stop that! Just stop!
Dara: *panting* Come on, this is absolutely unnecessary. It's just a case of books, take it if you like!
Traveler: That's all?
Dara: I swear it! This is all we dug out here!
Dara: Other than books, we did find some bottled mud and rocks... Well, there were some nice gems, actually...
Traveler: Did you take them?
Paimon: Hey! You better give those gems back! Those are precious geological samples!
Dara: Geological... samples...
Traveler: Give them back.
Dara: Yes! Sure! As you say! All of them! Quick, put everything back now...
Dara: See... Everything is back in the case. So, that's our cue to hit the road... Hehe...
Paimon: Great, that should be everything Sadife wants. Let's bring the case back to him.
Paimon: Still, he actually visited the desert alone, collected all those samples and wrote so many notes! Paimon thinks he's a great researcher!
Traveler: On the count of THREE.
Traveler: You sure there's nothing else?

## Talk 4

Sadife: Traveler, you've returned! About my case...
Traveler: Here.
Sadife: Excellent! Thank you so much... To think you had a recommendation letter, and yet I still made you do so much work... Please accept this payment.
Traveler: As the Purbirunis always say...
Sadife: Huh? So you actually know about that? Yes, Purbiruni does have this commandment...
Sadife: But this admonishment is to prevent us from betraying the principles of research for monetary or other external reasons.
Sadife: After all, a researcher who pursues research for profit... is unworthy of the title.
Sadife: But you went to such great lengths to help me, and thus you deserve a reward commensurate with your efforts.
Sadife: Thanks again for your help, and please do not hesitate to reach out in case you need anything.
Traveler: Is it that "Wisdom shall not be sold for gold"?
Traveler: I got it.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Hmm, this should be the place. Let's... start... digging...

## Talk 6

Khedive: Look who's here, eh? Did you find a Purbiruni? Not that hard, right?
Traveler: We did, but...
Khedive: Hmm? You seem pretty hesitant. Did someone give you any trouble?
Black Screen Text: You tell Khedive about everything that happened with Sadife...
Khedive: Ah, Sadife... He's known for his stubbornness, even his teachers can't always deal with him...
Khedive: He even turns down every single source of funding, and insists on working alone, to "keep his research pure"...
Paimon: So that's "Wisdom shall not be sold for gold" at work?
Khedive: Well, that's the Purbiruni rule... Haha, Pursina is much more flexible.
Khedive: Well... To be fair, it's just because I am rather well off.
Traveler: How did you make your money?
Khedive: What's with that skeptical face? I earned my wealth with hard work, okay? Do you even know how hard futures trading is?
Traveler: F-Futures trading?
Khedive: I tell you... One has to know transaction volumes, market trends, and then make the right investment decisions...
Khedive: At first I thought I'd just invest a little bit for fun, I didn't want it to impact my research...
Khedive: Who would have thought that... Ugh! I made more and more Mora, and the money I had sitting in the exchange grew and grew...
Khedive: I am a professional researcher! My interest lies in research and academic work! It's scholarly results that I'm after, not Mora! That's what I have been telling myself...
Khedive: However, whenever I'm in Sumeru City, I'm drawn to the exchange, and find myself trading futures, transaction after transaction...
Khedive: So my bank account balance kept increasing, while my research... No progress AT ALL!
Khedive: So! Here I am, having hired an entire team for an expedition to The Chasm. Staying far away from anywhere with an exchange is the only way I can get any research done!
Khedive: Without satisfactory results, I... I won't leave The Chasm!
Traveler: You make money through futures trading?
Traveler: Why are you so rich?
Traveler: Something happened...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Iris: *sigh* This paltry funding is by no means enough for my research...
Traveler: Um, excuse me...
Iris: A Purbiruni researcher? Right, you must be looking for Sadife. A guest for him... Quite unusual.
Iris: He's been back taking care of things at the Akademiya lately, and should be nearby... What's the matter?
Traveler: About Khedive's recommendation letter...
Iris: Khedive? So his research has wrapped up? Being rich must be nice, having a whole observation team supporting him...
Iris: ...whereas I can't even get a subsidy for a field trip...
Traveler: You know about Khedive?
Iris: Of course! We poor researchers, who scrounge for funding and never make any Mora, all know about his fabulous wealth.
Paimon: Whoa, you mean... this Khedive... and the researchers in his family, they're all loaded!?
Paimon: Does this mean we can get a big fat reward?
Iris: No way. Khedive is the exception. Don't go getting any unrealistic thoughts about the Purbiruni and Pursina researchers.
Iris: Especially those majoring in Astrology and minoring in History and Biology... In their fields, the unlucky ones can't even manage to apply for research funding.
Iris: Also, they always repeat something like "Wisdom shall not be sold for gold"...
Iris: *ahem* I shouldn't have said that... There's your man. Go ask him about anything else you want to know.
Traveler: About a Purbiruni researcher...

### Additional Talk 2

Iris: How on earth can I get funding... Ugh...

### Additional Talk 3

Hawa: I'd better get some rest. All this reading is making me dizzy...
