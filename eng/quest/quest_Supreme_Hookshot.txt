# Supreme Hookshot?


## Talk 1

Kayvan: You look like... You're a Traveler, right? Hanging out in such a place, are we? Nice choice.
Kayvan: Could it be that you are another fisher with your eyes on this area?
Kayvan: You've got a good eye! It's the best fishing site around these parts.
Paimon: But no one's fishing here, right? How can you be so certain?
Kayvan: Well, because I can see things they can't.
Kayvan: I'm the best angler here, and I have my own standards for fishing sites.
Traveler: R—Really?
Paimon: But where's the fish you caught?
Kayvan: Say no more. I'll show you what it means to be the "Supreme Hookshot."
Traveler: Supreme...
Kayvan: Bring me some special materials, and I will catch "fish" you've never seen before using my handmade bait.
Paimon: That feels... kinda suspicious. Will this handmade bait really work?
Traveler: Wouldn't hurt to try.
Kayvan: That's the spirit! I like you!
Kayvan: My handmade bait is based on Sunsettia and Wheat and is then further elevated by another material.
Traveler: Hookshot?

## Talk 2

Traveler: What kind of materials do you need?
Kayvan: I'm feeling... Zaytun Peach today.
Kayvan: It's common, but few consider it an ingredient with which to make bait.
Kayvan: Please find that for me, would you?

## Talk 3

Traveler: What kind of materials do you need?
Kayvan: I'm feeling up to some... Bird Eggs fresh from the nest today.
Kayvan: The eggs I usually use are found on the tree nearby. I'll show you the way.

## Talk 4

Traveler: What kind of materials do you need?
Kayvan: I'm feeling... How about a mushroom today?
Kayvan: The mushrooms I usually use are found in a special area, I'll show you where they can be found.
Kayvan: Please find this sort of mushroom for me.

## Talk 5

Kayvan: The bait this time requires Sunsettia, Wheat, and Zaytun Peach. Did you get them all?

## Talk 6

Kayvan: Great, we have all the materials. Now witness the creation of a unique bait.
Black Screen Text: Kayvan skillfully prepares the bait.
Kayvan: Alright, here goes. Hooks away!
Kayvan: Hook depth good... Flow speed moderate...
Kayvan: You gotta be quiet. The fish are really sensitive.
Kayvan: Even the footsteps on the bank could startle them.
Traveler: I'm standing still.
Kayvan: Then be patient and wait...
Black Screen Text: Kayvan catches a wet package.
Paimon: What is this? That's no fish!
Traveler: I sure have never seen a "fish" like that.
Kayvan: So that happened again. Just as expected.
Kayvan: Don't worry, outlander, stay calm. Don't gripe too much about the details.
Kayvan: Everything that comes with a hook could be considered a "fish."
Kayvan: Let me tell you, I didn't just invent the title of "the greatest angler" out of thin air.
Kayvan: After all, always catching lifeless things that could never bite the bait is something quite special, wouldn't you say?
Kayvan: Other anglers have praised my unique talents.
Traveler: They might be comforting you...
Paimon: So basically, you catch everything but fish...
Kayvan: Ahem! I don't care what they think! A—At least I never go home empty-handed!
Kayvan: I'll come again if I fail today, and I'll definitely catch a fish someday!
Kayvan: Anyway, thanks for finding the materials. Please take your payment here. I'm fishing somewhere else.
Kayvan: Next time... Next time, I'll definitely get a big fish! I'm sure of it!
Traveler: They might just be joking...
Traveler: Paimon never lands.
