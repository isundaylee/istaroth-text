# Who Is Mondstadt's Strongest Fighter?


## Talk 1

Jean: We must investigate further to find out why the Abyss Order has been so active lately.
Jean: #Traveler, please be on your guard.

## Talk 2

Patton: *sigh* Shame I only get to listen in from the other side of the window and don't get to join in the debate. I'd love to give my two cents...
Paimon: Say what? What's up, what's up? Paimon wants in!
Patton: Recently, all the customers at the tavern have been debating the exact same topic: "Who is the strongest fighter in Mondstadt?"
Paimon: The strongest fighter?
Paimon: Must be someone who can floor a whole gang of hilichurls with just one punch!
Traveler: There must be far more to it than that.
Paimon: Wow... then it really must be tough to become the strongest of all.
Paimon: But anyway... Is there, like, a general agreement in the city on who it is, or...?
Patton: Hah. Expecting people to come to a swift and straightforward consensus in the City of Freedom is like expecting Fisherman's Toast to drop out of the sky.
Patton: Everyone's got their own opinion, backed up by a unique set of cherry-picked information... But let's be honest, that's what makes the discussion so impassioned and entertaining.
Patton: Mainstream opinion is polarized, with most people supporting one of two candidates.
Patton: One is the Dandelion Knight, the other is the Darknight Hero.
Traveler: Paimon, who are you voting for?
Paimon: Paimon votes for you!
Paimon: But let's go into the *tavern* and talk to the patrons. Maybe we'll pick up some juicy gossip.
Patton: Oh, I do envy your life of leisure...
Patton: But don't mind me, of course. *sigh* I guess I'll just... get back to work.
Traveler: Anyone vote for me?
Traveler: Pff! I do that for fun.
Paimon: Then Paimon nominates you!

## Talk 3

Six-Fingered José: #Hey, amigo!
Six-Fingered José: #Do you want to hear my latest composition? I put my whole heart into it, and also my soul. How about it, amigo?

## Talk 4

Paimon: Patton was right about one thing.
Traveler: Everyone has an opinion.
Paimon: If everyone's got their own opinion and can't be persuaded...
Paimon: ...How are we ever gonna find out who Mondstadt's strongest fighter is?
Paimon: ...Eureka! Paimon's got it!
Paimon: Let's go see what *Jean* says.
Paimon: Bet the Knights have got an official ranking table for this kind of thing!
Traveler: What makes you so sure?
Paimon: Come on, let's just go and ask already. We'll never find out if we don't!
Traveler: Ooh! Do you think I'll be on there?
Paimon: Guess it depends if they counted all your shenanigans or not.
Paimon: Don't worry though, Paimon has full confidence in your abilities!
Traveler: Not just that, but some people's choice of candidate was just plain weird.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Oh, Master Jean! Sorry to bother you, we're collecting intel on the strongest fighter in Mondstadt.
Paimon: Do you have... uh, one of those... official Knights of Favonius—verified ranking table... thingies?
Jean: Strongest fighter in Mondstadt?
Jean: I am sorry, but I cannot help. I do not have any relevant documentation on that topic...
Paimon: Oh... Well, that sucks.
Paimon: #Paimon was hoping Traveler would at least make the top five.
Jean: Hehe. Well, although I do not have the data to make such an assessment, I will say that my faith in our Honorary Knight's abilities has never wavered.
Jean: Which reminds me...
Jean: Recently, one of the Abyss Order's Mages has been active near the city, although he is keeping a low profile.
Jean: If you are staying around Mondstadt, please be on the lookout for danger.
Jean: Given your... well, high-ranking fighting strength, I trust you will be able to help keep the area safe.
Paimon: #Awesome! After Traveler defeats the Abyss Order, {F#she'll}{M#he'll} climb up that ranking table faster than {F#she}{M#he} climbs up all those cliffs!
Traveler: Paimon. There is no ranking table.
Paimon: Well, either way, smashing the Abyss Order to bits is the right thing to do.
Jean: Hehe. I like your enthusiasm. It is infectious.
Jean: But be careful out there.
Traveler: D'you think I'll get to first place?

## Talk 6

Jack: Hey, I'm doing some adventurer's training... alcohol tolerance training, to be precise... Wanna join me?

## Talk 7

Jack: You seem to have had one too many.
Jack: Really? Let me see... eight beers, five wines, seven ciders... Not so much!
Jack: I'm no match for those legendary Mondstadt adventurers who can drink half of Cider Lake's worth of wine...
Jack: ...Only a figure of speech? Really? No wonder... I could never figure out how they could afford so much wine on an adventurer's income...

## Talk 8

Jack: What kind of liquor do you prefer?
Jack: Me...? Beer. I don't like it that much though...
Jack: It's just that... beggars can't be choosers...
Jack: As long as it gets me drunk, it's all good... Don't you agree?

## Talk 9

Jack: Goodbye.
Jack: Laters! Happy adventuring!

## Talk 10

Traveler: ...Um, who are you?
Six-Fingered José: You can call me Six-Fingered José, it's okay.
Six-Fingered José: I am a beloved bard of Mondstadt... Or I should say, I used to be beloved.
Traveler: Sing for me, José, por favor!
Six-Fingered José: Oh? You want to hear my latest song? I call it Ode to a Morning Breeze.
Six-Fingered José: ...I just need to tune my instrument.
Six-Fingered José: Uh-oh...
Six-Fingered José: I am so sorry. I have had no audience to play for for so long that now my strings are a little... I'll sing for you next time.
Traveler: Are there many other bards in Mondstadt?
Six-Fingered José: #Are you kidding me, amigo? Mondstadt is known all over for its songs from the pastures!
Six-Fingered José: But lately a mysterious bard appeared in this place. I checked all over, but I can't find out anything about him.
Six-Fingered José: Since he came here, my audience has slowly disappeared.
Six-Fingered José: I did consider a battle of the bards...
Six-Fingered José: But I think even I would be seduced by his beautiful voice...

## Talk 11

Charles: What'll it be today?

## Talk 12

Klee: I—I'm fine! I'm not hurt! Sorry for bumping into you.
Traveler: You dropped something.
Paimon: Hey, look, there's some writing on here...
Paimon: "Explosion inside city wall, grounded be thy woe," "Explosions can hurt people, Jean can be dreadful," "Mondstadt be bombed, Klee be doomed..."
Klee: Yikes...
Klee: Mr. Kaeya wrote these down for me, um... they're, um... survival rules.
Paimon: Survival rules?
Klee: Y—Yeah... Rules that I must absolutely never break under any circumstances.
Klee: Otherwise, something terrible would happen.
Traveler: Kaeya writes like this?
Klee: Yep!
Klee: Ah, I forgot to introduce myself!
Klee: My name is Klee.
Traveler: Hello, Klee.
Klee: I've heard all about you guys! You're the Honorary Knight who helps Mondstadt!
Paimon: Wow!
Paimon: More recognition, yay! Paimon is so happy right now.
Klee: I heard it from Amber... But wait, no— there's no time for this right now.
Klee: I'm dealing with a big emergency. I grabbed my map and ran as fast as I could all the way here.
Traveler: What's wrong?
Klee: Th—The treasure I buried in the *Whispering Woods*, it's... gone.
Paimon: Did you say... buried treasure!?
Traveler: I think she needs our help.
Paimon: Exactly what Paimon was thinking!
Paimon: Lost treasure is a big deal. Let us help you find it!
Klee: Yay! Thanks, you guys!
Klee: Here! Here's where the map says the treasure should be. I put a circle round it.
Klee: I also put a wooden sign in the ground at the place where I buried it. To make it easier to find!
Paimon: (...Paimon is starting to understand how this treasure went missing so easily.)
Klee: #Come on {F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight, let's go!
Traveler: A girl dressed in red, hmm...
Paimon: And she has treasure!
Paimon: (Seriously? Klee gets Six-Fingered José's vote for strongest fighter in Mondstadt? What is wrong with people...)
Traveler: #My name is Traveler.
Paimon: And Paimon's name is... well, Paimon.
Traveler: Something terrible?

## Talk 13

Jack: Who's the strongest fighter in Mondstadt?
Jack: You want to know who I think the toughest fighter is?
Jack: In my opinion, that would be the finest adventurer of them all — Stanley.
Jack: Guild Master Cyrus is up there with the toughest, too, but only Stanley can take on the bloodthirsty beasts of the Mare Jivari!
Paimon: Bloodthirsty beasts of the Mare Jivari? Sounds terrifying!
Paimon: D'you reckon you'd be scared if you were faced with one of those?
Traveler: I'd beat it to a pulp.
Paimon: Yeah! Bam, wham, pow!
Traveler: I'd run for my life.
Paimon: Sensible choice. Safety first and all that.

## Talk 14

Bruce: Who's the strongest fighter in Mondstadt?
Bruce: Er... *hic* The strongest fighter of them all?
Bruce: That would be Jean, obviously! *hic*
Bruce: Why? Grand Master Jean is so strong... she can take out a Ruin Guard with just a few slashes of her sword. *hic*
Bruce: And she could wipe out the three hilichurl tribes at Dadaupa Gorge all by her... *hic* self.
Bruce: Otherwise, we wouldn't have such a carefree existence... with nothing to do...
Paimon: It's true that Jean makes people feel they're in safe hands.
Paimon: Meanwhile, this guy is drunk as a skunk!

## Talk 15

Charles: Who's the strongest fighter in Mondstadt?
Charles: The strongest fighter? I don't pay much attention to that sort of thing...
Paimon: Huh. Paimon thought bartenders had some kind of special information sources.
Traveler: Just like they have an exclusive supplier of wine?
Paimon: Exactly! That's what Paimon was getting at.
Charles: I have no involvement in any intelligence-gathering operation.
Charles: But if you made me pick someone, it would be the Darknight Hero.
Charles: I've heard some stories about him. Apparently, he once rescued a city dweller from the Abyss Order.
Paimon: There it is — the barman's top-secret intelligence!
Paimon: Speaking of the Abyss Order, their minions are really stirring up trouble all over the place, aren't they?

## Talk 16

Six-Fingered José: Who's the strongest fighter in Mondstadt?
Six-Fingered José: Eh? The most macho in Mondstadt?
Six-Fingered José: ...She's a little girlie who wears red.
Traveler: A girl dressed in red?
Six-Fingered José: That's right! I found this out one day about half a month ago, when I went to the Stormbearer Mountains looking for inspiration for my new song.
Six-Fingered José: Guess what happened?
Paimon: What happened?
Six-Fingered José: I witnessed the most powerful destructive force I have ever seen in my life!
Six-Fingered José: I'm telling you, it completely changed the whole landscape in that part of the mountains!
Paimon: Holy moly!
Six-Fingered José: I was hiding behind a bush and I saw this little girlie in red clothing running into the distance, leaving a trail of destruction in her wake.
Six-Fingered José: *sigh* But I don't know if anyone will believe me.
Paimon: Hmm... Now that you mention it, the idea of a tiny little girl wielding that much destructive power is a little far-fetched...
Six-Fingered José: You want to know what I think? I think she has a treasure nobody else knows about.
Six-Fingered José: Maybe even the most powerful treasure in all of Mondstadt!
Paimon: Did you say treasure!?
Paimon: #Traveler, did Paimon imagine that or did you hear it too?
Six-Fingered José: It's... just a guess. I mean... No, it's a bard's razor-sharp intuition!
Traveler: I don't buy it.
Six-Fingered José: How can you say such a thing...
Paimon: So, this girl. What's her name?
Six-Fingered José: Ah... I do not know her name. I do not see her often in Mondstadt.
Six-Fingered José: Hey, I am telling the truth! You gotta believe me!
Paimon: Hmmm... Doesn't sound like much to go on...
Paimon: But thanks for your intel!
Traveler: I'll take you at your word, for now.
Six-Fingered José: #Thank you, amigo! Ah, I am so happy to meet a true amigo. Who would have thought—

Bruce: ...Huh? What difference does it make when I slack off all day anyway, you say?
Bruce: Well there's nothing to do because... because Mondstadt is just so peaceful, that's why.
Bruce: I'm sure my life would have been more interesting if I'd gone with the Adventurers' Guild instead...
Traveler: ...What makes you say that?
