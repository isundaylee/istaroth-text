# The Trail of the God of Wisdom


## Talk 1

Paimon: Let's see, Tighnari wrote an address on the letter's envelope... Oh, it's not far from the city's gate.
Paimon: Let's head over and have a look. Hopefully he's at home.

## Talk 2

Paimon: *sigh* Well, seems no matter which way we try, we can't find anything that'll lead us to Lesser Lord Kusanali. Hmm, guess our only choice now is to try meeting with the researcher that Tighnari recommended.
Paimon: He's from Sumeru and even has a position in the Akademiya. Maybe he'll be able to access more info from the Akasha.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Alright, off to the Citadel of Regzar we go!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Let's head over to the Citadel of Regzar and wait for Dehya.

## Talk 5

Asfand: Welcome! The Adventurers' Guild told me to expect you two.
Paimon: It's nice to meet you, Asfand! We'd like to ask you about something.
Black Screen Text: You explain your reason for coming here...
Asfand: I see. So Katheryne's the one who sent you this way.
Asfand: Heh, it's true that the Eremites' network is vast, but even I can't help you meet the Dendro Archon.
Paimon: Wait, seriously? That's it?
Asfand: Haha, 'fraid so. The Eremites aren't terribly religious, so we don't know much about divinities. As far as the Akasha goes, we can access even less than you.
Asfand: We originally came from the desert — the gods there died off long ago. Since those days, we've used our own two hands to carve out a living. We don't beg gods for their aid.
Asfand: It isn't just us, though. If you ask me, I think most in Sumeru aren't interested in Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Paimon: Oh? Why's that?
Asfand: Just take the Akademiya for example. They're the ones who truly rule Sumeru. Although they believe in gods, most of 'em only care for the late Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.
Asfand: In their eyes, she was the one who founded Sumeru and gifted us with the Akasha. Lesser Lord Kusanali just happened to inherit her legacy.
Asfand: Because of the Akademiya's influence, most citizens are more familiar with Greater Lord Rukkhadevata and hold her in greater esteem.
Asfand: Not to mention that Lesser Lord Kusanali never makes an appearance, and the Akademiya never announces anything about her. As far as the people of Sumeru are concerned, she's just a god that exists... and that's all.
Paimon: Really? Aw, after hearing all of that, Paimon sorta feels bad for Lesser Lord Kusanali...
Asfand: Hah, but who knows? We're all just guessing when it comes down to it. Besides, I'm sure the God of Wisdom doesn't worry about her reputation among people like us.
Paimon: Alright, well thanks for the info, Asfand.
Asfand: Haha, no problem. Always happy to help out the Adventurers' Guild.

## Talk 6

Muruwa: Hey, have you two seen a brown-haired girl wearing a purple top and a long blue dress? We're lookin' for her.
Paimon: Did she have bandages wrapped around her wrists?
Muruwa: Yes, that's her! Did you see which direction she went?
Paimon: Oh, yeah, she went that way!
Muruwa: Quick! After her!
Paimon: Hehe, that should keep 'em busy for a while. Let's hurry and find Dunyarzad.

## Talk 7

Paimon: There you are, Dunyarzad! We thought you might've been long gone by now.
Dunyarzad: Ah! It's you two. You startled me there.
Paimon: You can relax now, we threw those people looking for you off the trail.
Dunyarzad: Really? Oh, thank you so much! Unfortunately, I believe there are still more of them out there looking for me.
Dunyarzad: Uh oh, looks like there are some coming this way...
Paimon: Huh!? More of them!? Then what are we standing here for? Run!
Dunyarzad: No, wait... I, uh... My body isn't in the best shape. It's difficult for me to run.
Traveler: How about we find someplace to hide?
Dunyarzad: Okay, sounds good. There's a tavern on the other side of the port that we can go to. They probably wouldn't expect me to hide in a place like that.
Paimon: Alright, let's move out. Stay behind us, we'll keep an eye out for anyone looking for you.

## Talk 8

Dunyarzad: Whew, we made it. They shouldn't be able to find us now... Wait. Stand down, Dehya!
Dehya: #My lady, who are these two?
Dunyarzad: #They're travelers that I met on the street just a moment ago. They happened to notice that you all were searching for me, so they helped me hide.
Dehya: I see. In that case, you two should scram. There's nothing here for you.
Paimon: Wait a sec, who the heck are you? And why are you shooing us away?
Dehya: I'm Miss Dunyarzad's bodyguard, here to see that she returns home safe and sound.
Dehya: My lady, let's get going. You've been gone for so long that your parents are worrying themselves sick.
Dunyarzad: And if I refuse to go with you?
Dehya: It'd be easier for the both of us if you cooperated, but if you insist on not going, then I'll have to carry you like a sack of potatoes.
Paimon: Hey! Dunyarzad already said she doesn't want to go back. Why are you still pushing her?
Dehya: Stay out of this. You don't understand the situation.
Dehya: Sorry, my lady. Even though I'm your bodyguard, your parents are my employers. I have to answer to them.
Dunyarzad: ...How much?
Dehya: Wait, what?
Dunyarzad: How much Mora do I have to pay you to become your employer, so you never listen to my parents ever again? Double... Triple? Give me some time and I'll get that much!
Dehya: My lady, this isn't about Mora.
Dehya: *sigh* I don't know what you think of us Eremites, but let me say this: I like Mora, but I'll never go against my principles.
Dehya: That's why I'm here looking for you. Sure, it's an order from my employer, but my conscience was also telling me it's the right thing to do.
Dehya: And knowing your health, carelessly running around like this is gonna hurt ya. For the sake of those who love you, don't be stubborn.
Dunyarzad: No, you're wrong! I'm aware of my limits, and I know what I'm doing. Honestly, the only people being stubborn right now are my parents.
Dunyarzad: They know perfectly well that it makes no difference if I'm at home or not! They still won't accept reality!
Dunyarzad: And every time I bring this up, they just change the subject. Dehya, you've been living with us a long time already. This should be old news to you.
Dehya: ...
Dunyarzad: Dehya, I know it hasn't been easy for Mother and Father, and I'm grateful for everything they've done for me, but there is someone else in this world I'm also grateful to.
Dunyarzad: Because she saved me. The love I have for her is the same I have for my parents.
Dunyarzad: This is my life and my last chance, so I want to do something meaningful!
Dehya: My lady, are you sure what you're doing now is meaningful?
Dunyarzad: Yes, I'm sure. At least... it is to me.
Dehya: *sigh* Fine, I won't ask you to return home anymore.
Dehya: But lemme make something very clear: I'm only doing this because I respect your determination, not because I agree with you.
Dunyarzad: Thank you, Dehya! Sorry for being so rude just now. My nerves were acting up... And I even brought up your payment in such an offensive way...
Dehya: Don't worry about it, my lady. I did say that I like Mora. Besides, that's our next topic of conversation.
Dehya: Today's little excursion caused such a ruckus that every single bodyguard at the estate was deployed. It won't be easy to hide things from your old man.
Dehya: Since this definitely won't be your last escapade, here's a little tip... You should at least make it look like your room and things are still in order when you leave. Also, you'll need someone to cover for you when you're out and about.
Dehya: So I'll let you hire me, my lady. This way, everyone wins. As for the pay... let's say half of what your father pays me. We can settle the bill when we return to the estate.
Dunyarzad: Okay, deal.
Paimon: Yay, looks like they've reached an understanding.
Dunyarzad: Hmm...
Traveler: Dunyarzad, are you alright?
Dunyarzad: Haha, I'm fine, really. I just feel a little tired now that things have calmed down...
Dehya: My lady, stop trying to look tough. We're already in a tavern, so let's rest up and grab some grub.
Dunyarzad: I'm sorry for worrying you two. If you don't mind, I'd like for you to join us.
Paimon: Sure! After you rest up, we wanna hear more about Lesser Lord Kusanali!

## Talk 9

Lambad: Hah! Well, if it isn't Dehya! Haven't seen you in nearly half a year.
Lambad: Word on the street is that you are a bodyguard for the Homayani family now. Heh, don't you find that kind of work boring?
Dehya: Heh, you get used to it. How about a menu over here!
Lambad: You got it. Huh? Isn't this lil' Miss Homayani herself? Heh, we don't get to serve personages like you very often. We'll be sure to prepare our very best!
Dunyarzad: Thank you, sir, but there's no need. I don't have a lot of Mora on me, and I really ought to save as much as I can.
Dunyarzad: Ah, but please bring these two the best food you have. They're my new friends, so I want to be a good host for them.
Traveler: No need to break the bank, we'll eat whatever you order.
Paimon: Yeah! We're already super grateful for everything you told us about Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Lambad: How about our Charcoal-Baked Ajilenakh Cakes? They're our signature snack, and they run cheap. Look, other customers over there are eating some now.
Paimon: Huh? They look kinda burnt and dry... Uh, Paimon will pass.
Traveler: Picky Paimon? Now that's a first...
Paimon: Hey, c'mon! Paimon has personal preferences too, you know!
Black Screen Text: After ordering, you continue chatting with Dunyarzad about Lesser Lord Kusanali...
Paimon: Dunyarzad, we asked a lot of people when we first arrived, and almost nobody was interested in Lesser Lord Kusanali. So what made you want to follow her?
Dunyarzad: Well, remember when you asked me if I knew how to meet the Dendro Archon? Even though I don't know how, I think I've actually seen her before.
Paimon: Huh, really?
Dunyarzad: Yes, it was when I was a child. At that time, my illness had kept me bedridden for the better part of a year.
Dunyarzad: I was stuck inside and couldn't make any friends, and my parents did their best to find treatments for me... But even then, the Akasha didn't have any helpful information.
Dunyarzad: My younger self no longer had any hopes or dreams. One flare-up was so bad that I was in a semi-conscious state for several days.
Dunyarzad: Then one night, I woke up alone in my room. I was terrified, my body was paralyzed. Even if I cried, there was no sound.
Dunyarzad: At that moment, an ethereal voice spoke in my mind: "Dunyarzad, don't be scared. You don't have to cry."
Nahida (???): Dunyarzad, don't be scared. You don't have to cry.
Dunyarzad: Huh? Who are you? How do you know my name?
Nahida (???): Umm, how do I explain this... You might not be able to understand, but actually, I know everything about you.
Dunyarzad: Really?
Nahida (???): Of course. I know that you're scared of thunder, that you hate taking medicine every morning, and that you love counting the petals on your mom's skirt.
Dunyarzad: Wow, you really do know everything.
Nahida (???): Dunyarzad, is there anything you want?
Dunyarzad: Want? Not really... I can't go anywhere or do anything.
Nahida (???): Huh? But aren't you a child? All children have wishes. Tell me what you want, and maybe I can make it happen.
Dunyarzad: Then... Can you make my illness go away?
Nahida (???): Oh... I'm sorry, but I'm not powerful enough to do that right now...
Dunyarzad: Then... Can you be my friend?
Dunyarzad: After that, the voice said, "Okay, I'll be your friend."
Dunyarzad: Although my body was suffering during those days, that voice encouraged me and told me many wondrous things.
Dunyarzad: Beyond my window was the flourishing Sumeru City, beyond the city was a lush rainforest, and beyond that was the Wall of Samiel, deserts, and all of Teyvat...
Dunyarzad: Once I finally made it through that bout of illness, I couldn't hear the voice anymore. I told my mother about it, but she said that I must have been dreaming.
Dunyarzad: But I know that that voice wasn't a figment of my imagination! Before that, I had never heard of "Teyvat."
Traveler: So you believe the voice you heard was...
Dunyarzad: Yes, for sure!
Dunyarzad: If it weren't for that voice, I would have never grown curious about the outside world, nor would I have learned how to read and enjoy so many books.
Dunyarzad: That voice sparked a desire for wisdom — it had to have been the Dendro Archon.
Dunyarzad: I've been hoping for a chance to repay her kindness. In fact, I was running around today to help prepare the Sabzeruz Festival for her!
Paimon: What's the Sabzeruz Festival?
Dunyarzad: It is Lesser Lord Kusanali's birthday, which is the day that she was found by the sages.
Dunyarzad: It's actually an old holiday that originally celebrated Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's birthday. When she passed away, the holiday eventually became a celebration of the Lesser Lord's birthday.
Dunyarzad: I heard everyone was overjoyed when they welcomed her back to Sumeru. In those days, the festival was a huge deal.
Dunyarzad: But because of the Akademiya's influence, people have gradually lost interest in the festival.
Dunyarzad: The Akademiya actively participates in Sumeru's many holidays dedicated to Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, but when it comes to the Sabzeruz Festival, forget any funding, they practically act like it doesn't exist.
Dunyarzad: Maybe they see Lesser Lord Kusanali's birth as confirmation of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's death, so they're reluctant to celebrate it.
Paimon: Aw, but that's awful!
Dunyarzad: It is. It's absolutely terrible!
Dunyarzad: Sure, the Greater Lord founded Sumeru, but hasn't Lesser Lord Kusanali been the one quietly protecting us for the past few hundred years?
Dehya: *ahem* Just remember that we're still out in public. Don't get too carried away now...
Dunyarzad: I know that people over by the Grand Bazaar still hold the Sabzeruz Festival to this day. But I hadn't met any of them before, so I was never able to contribute.
Dunyarzad: But recently, I made a friend there who also follows Lesser Lord Kusanali!
Dunyarzad: I gave her my savings because I want her to throw a wonderful festival this year. That's the least I could do for Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Dehya: Hold on. My lady, does this friend happen to be Nilou? The one who sends flowers to the estate?
Dunyarzad: Yes, that's her.
Dehya: I saw her leaving the other day with a nervous look on her face, it seemed like she was hiding something in her arms. Did you give her something?
Dunyarzad: Ah, yes... Initially, I didn't have much Mora prepared, so I had Nilou sell one of my skirts.
Dunyarzad: I've agreed with Nilou to meet up at the Grand Bazaar today and see how things are coming along. Dehya, would you accompany me?
Dehya: Sure. That's quite the trip though — I'll carry you.
Dunyarzad: No, that would be too much, even for you.
Dehya: You might as well just accept the lift. If I let you walk, who knows how long it'll take us! And if anything happens to you, then I'd really never hear the end of it from your father.
Traveler: Can we also come along?
Dunyarzad: But of course! Nilou will be thrilled to hear that there are more people interested in Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Traveler: It was Lesser Lord Kusanali?
Traveler: But you've cooked Slimes before...
Paimon: Hmph! What do you have against my Slime dishes?
Traveler: Don't worry about it. We'll pay for our own food.
Paimon: Wait, we're paying for ourselves now? Aww... Paimon kinda wanted to try something fancy, but we aren't exactly loaded. Guess Paimon will settle for something ordinary...

## Talk 10

Dunyarzad: Sorry I'm late, Nilou.
Nilou: Oh, Dunyarzad! It was taking you so long that I assumed you got trapped at home, but you made it in the end!
Nilou: Uh oh, but if Dehya's here, that means you got caught, right?
Dunyarzad: You could say that, but everything worked out! She's on our side now.
Dehya: Hah, not completely.
Nilou: Oh? And who are these two?
Dunyarzad: #Oh, meet Traveler and Paimon, my two newest friends. They're visitors who just arrived at Sumeru City and are looking for information on Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Nilou: So you're followers from another land?
Traveler: Yep!
Nilou: That's wonderful! You two absolutely mustn't miss the Sabzeruz Festival!
Nilou: By the way, Dunyarzad, we've already started decorating the Grand Bazaar. It looks spectacular, thanks to your generous contribution!
Dunyarzad: You're very welcome! It's the only thing I could do. Do you still have enough Mora?
Nilou: Uh, probably...? But don't sweat it. We've already finished renovating the stage! Come on, I'll show you.
Traveler: Truthfully, no.
Nilou: Oh, really? Well, that's okay. You're still invited to the Sabzeruz Festival!

## Talk 11

Traveler: Think "Greater Lord Rukkhadevata."
Traveler: (Many bright dots of light appeared in my mind. I probably need to calm my mind and focus more to understand what they mean.)
Traveler: (Feelings of affection, intimacy, nostalgia, sadness, and anxiety also come to my mind... These seem to be what the people of Sumeru feel about their departed archon.)
Paimon: Uh oh, Paimon's getting all teary-eyed all of a sudden... It feels like the people of Sumeru really miss their archon.

## Talk 12

Paimon: Wow, this place is amazing!
Dehya: Not bad. Heh, the last time I was here, the stairs were full of holes.
Nilou: The stairs were nothing! A little while ago, we discovered that the tree above the stage had a huge chunk of bark ready to fall off. Mr. Zubayr was worried sick!
Nilou: We reported it to the Akademiya many times, but they never sent anyone to deal with it. We didn't want anything bad happening, so we were going to cancel all the stage performances.
Traveler: Why didn't anyone come to handle it?
Dehya: Oh, probably because it was the theater asking.
Nilou: The Akademiya looks down on performers like us. They probably think it would be best if the theater closed down completely.
Nilou: We can't let that happen, though. Not only would everyone involved in the theater go hungry, but then we wouldn't be able to hold the Sabzeruz Festival anymore.
Nilou: Thank the Dendro Archon for Dunyarzad! With the Mora she gave us, we hired someone to patch up the tree, and we also gave the stage a much-needed makeover.
Nilou: The stage is going to be even prettier when it's festival time! I can't wait for you to see it!
Dunyarzad: And I can't wait to see you on the stage! You've been practicing so long already — it's almost time for your dream to become reality!
Nilou: It's OUR dream! I'll do my best for the two of us.
Paimon: Nilou, what are you gonna be doing at the festival?
Dunyarzad: She'll be dancing the Dance of Sabzeruz, the most important performance at the Sabzeruz Festival.
Nilou: #Dunyarzad, have you told them the origin of this holiday?
Dunyarzad: I only told them about the Greater Lord and Lesser Lord so far.
Nilou: Okay, then I'll tell you two about how this holiday came to be...
Nilou: According to legend, the Sabzeruz Festival was originally the Goddess of Flowers' birthday celebration for the Greater Lord.
Nilou: A long, long time ago, on one of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's birthdays, her friends threw her a celebratory banquet.
Nilou: Some of the gods got drunk. One started playing music and the Greater Lord started singing, so the Goddess of Flowers began to dance.
Nilou: As she danced upon the grass, countless beautiful Padisarahs began to bloom wherever she stepped.
Nilou: Those brilliant purple flowers became her dazzling stage. All the gods clamored, "Oh, if only time could stop at this very moment."
Traveler: Sounds like they had a great time.
Nilou: Of course they did! When people mention the gods, they always think of the Archon War, but Sumeru's gods also had happy times.
Nilou: Although they aren't around anymore, they're preserved in our tradition of dance. This outfit I'm wearing is apparently based on how the Goddess of Flowers looked.
Nilou: Though we're just tiny people compared to the divine, we still have to do our best to make sure that the birthday girl feels loved on her special day.
Dunyarzad: Nilou, you of all people will definitely be able to convey our well wishes to the Dendro Archon. I also noticed that you went the extra mile and scattered Padisarahs around the stage.
Nilou: Hehe, they symbolize the Goddess of Flowers after all. It's just a shame that all the real Padisarahs went extinct after her death.
Dunyarzad: Yeah. The Greater Lord brought forth Padisarahs in memory of the Goddess of Flowers, but she ultimately could never truly replicate that beautiful purple.
Nilou: Thinking about the Goddess of Flowers' dance makes me wish I could've seen it.
Nilou: If my stage were anything like that... *sigh* I'd be thrilled if I had just two real Padisarahs on the stage.
Nilou: So Traveler and Paimon, what do you think? Interested in the Sabzeruz Festival? Will you two be coming?
Dunyarzad: All of Lesser Lord Kusanali's followers will be there for her birthday. It'll be a good opportunity for you to learn more about her.
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon thinks that's a great idea!
Traveler: You sure it's not because you want in on the fun?
Paimon: Hey c'mon, there's nothing wrong with enjoying a festival! Besides, it's Lesser Lord Kusanali's birthday. She'll be happy to have more people who are celebrating it.
Dunyarzad: Hehe, so how about we all attend the Sabzeruz Festival together?
Traveler: Sounds like a plan!
Nilou: Dunyarzad, let me show you which stage decorations we've picked out so far. Traveler and Paimon, if that doesn't sound interesting to you, then feel free to explore the area.
Nilou: Everyone at the Grand Bazaar loves Lesser Lord Kusanali, and we're all looking forward to the Sabzeruz Festival.
Paimon: In that case, we'll take a look around.
Traveler: You sure it's not because you want to watch Nilou dance?
Paimon: Of course Paimon wants to watch! Those two things aren't mutually exclusive, you know.
Traveler: That sounds somewhat bittersweet.
Nilou: Huh, really? Oh, you probably mean because all the gods in this story are no longer alive.

## Talk 13

Dunyarzad: Nilou, your outfit looks amazing. There's also something different about you from when we first met up.
Nilou: Hehe, I thought I'd add little extra pizzazz to my dress for the festival. See?
Dunyarzad: Wow, did you sew all that yourself?
Nilou: Uh-huh, sewing is a fundamental skill for everyone in the theater company because we make all our own costumes. Did you know that Mr. Zubayr not only can make costumes, but props too?
Nilou: Hehe, I've noticed that you can't keep your eyes off this crown. Would you like to try it on?
Dunyarzad: Oh, may I?
Nilou: Of course! The legends say that the Goddess of Flowers had beautiful horns on her head, so this crown was made to reflect that. Ah, Dunyarzad! You look absolutely stunning with it on! It's like I'm looking at the Goddess of Flowers herself...

## Talk 14

Dehya: Revamping the stage for the festival couldn't have been easy, that's for sure. I bet this year's festival will be one to remember.
Dehya: I don't know much about the Grand Bazaar, but I do know that the residents here have a penchant for song and dance... Heh, two things that the Akademiya doesn't particularly approve of.
Dehya: Oh, and the perfume sold around here is a lot better than what you'll find elsewhere. The fragrances are longer-lasting, and they're gentler on your skin...
Dehya: Uh, I mean... that's what I've heard, at least!

## Talk 15

Kumari: Whoa, what's with your yellow hair? And why do your clothes look so funny? Are you an outlander?
Kumari: Did you know that the Sabzeruz Festival is about to happen? There'll be loads of fun things to do at the festival, but the best part is when Farris, the Knight of Flowers, passes out candy to everyone!

## Talk 16

Shrimati: Ah, dancing at the Sabzeruz Festival. You know, I also danced when I was younger.
Shrimati: As a child, I even asked my grandmother why we performed the dance for the Lesser Lord when it was originally done to honor the Greater Lord.
Shrimati: My grandmother said that Greater Lord Rukkhadevata is a beloved deity and honored by all, and Lesser Lord Kusanali is too. If the Goddess of Flowers ever knew Lesser Lord Kusanali, then she would certainly have wished to be her friend and hold celebrations for her, too!
Shrimati: The Sabzeruz Festival has been losing its appeal over the years... That is, until a wealthy benefactor stepped in this year and brought the festival back to life. I heard she forked out a lot of Mora to make it all happen.

## Talk 17

Farhad: Things are really shaping up, and there's a buzz around the festival this year. We're expecting people from all over to come by this year and buy things during the festivities.
Farhad: Don't be fooled into thinking that Sumeru City has the best of everything. Some festival snacks are only offered here in the Grand Bazaar.
Farhad: And when it comes to musicians, dancers, or singers, the Grand Bazaar's got the best of the best! Sure, those folks at the Akademiya might not like it, but what's a festival without song and dance?

## Talk 18

Paimon: Hey, is that who Paimon thinks it is? It looks like... Katheryne!
Katheryne: ♪ *hums* ♪
Paimon: Huh, come to think of it, Paimon's only ever seen her behind the counter at the Adventurers' Guild... This is the first time we've ever seen her taking a break.
Paimon: Hey Katheryne!
Katheryne: Hmm? Oh, hey, it's the Traveler and Paimon. What's shakin'?
Paimon: Whoa, break time Katheryne sure sounds a lot less formal than usual. Paimon was still waiting for her to say "ad astra abyssosque"!
Katheryne: Sure, standing behind the counter at the Adventurers' Guild doesn't require any complicated functions.
Katheryne: But saying and doing the same old things over and over again can get pretty monotonous, like watching the same Fontaine movie day after day.
Katheryne: But take you two for example. You travel across Teyvat to enrich your lives and gain new experiences.
Paimon: #Well, we enjoy traveling across Teyvat and all that, but we're mainly looking for clues about his sister.
Katheryne: Yes, and you should keep searching. Sometimes the answers we're looking for aren't necessarily at our intended destination. Instead, they're found along the way.
Paimon: Huh, haven't we heard someone say something pretty similar recently? Anyways, what brings you out here, Katheryne?
Traveler: Are you also a fan of the Sabzeruz Festival?
Katheryne: No, not particularly, I guess you could say that I'm loving the recent atmosphere here. If festivals bring happiness to everyone, then that's where their true value lies.
Katheryne: Oh, it looks like it's about time for me to be heading back now.
Paimon: Alright, we'll see you next time at the Adventurers' Guild! Oh, by the way, thanks for connecting us with the Eremites. We've already made some great friends in Sumeru City thanks to you!
Katheryne: I'm sure you two will get along well with the people here. You've already been blessed by the element of Dendro, after all. See ya around!
Paimon: Hmm, there's something really different about Katheryne today...
Dehya: Hey, Traveler, Paimon.
Paimon: Oh hey, Dehya. What's going on?
Dehya: I've got something to tell ya. My lady knows you're looking for ways to meet Lesser Lord Kusanali, and she's been trying to come up with a way to help you. Well, I have an idea that might help.
Paimon: Are you serious? We'd love that!
Dehya: It might not necessarily pan out, so don't get your hopes up too much. I'll need to take you two somewhere and ask someone some questions.
Traveler: What about Dunyarzad?
Dehya: My lady is feeling a little worn out at the moment. Nilou's found a place for her to rest. After I take my lady home, let's meet in front of the Citadel of Regzar.
Paimon: Sounds like a plan!

## Talk 19

Dehya: Sorry, I'm late. It took some convincing for the master and mistress to believe that Miss Dunyarzad was only sitting in the port for a while because she was in a bad mood.
Dehya: Anyway, I guess I should be thanking you. I haven't seen Miss Dunyarzad that happy in a long time. If wasn't for you two, she probably would've been caught and dragged back much earlier.
Paimon: You sure sound a whole lot nicer than when we first met, Dehya. Who would've thought you had such a soft spot for Dunyarzad?
Dehya: Tch, it's called being a professional. I'm a bodyguard, and I work for whoever's paying.
Paimon: Hehe, look! Dehya's blushing!
Traveler: Yep, that's a blush if I've ever seen one.
Dehya: Ugh! Listen, you two...
Dehya: I don't expect to be working for Miss Dunyarzad very long, but I hope to finish things on a positive note if possible... Let's cut the chitchat and head into the Citadel. We'll see if the person I know has a way for you two to meet with the Lesser Lord.
Dehya: Oh, heya Chief!
Asfand: Ah, Dehya! What're you doing here? And well, well, didn't expect to see you three together.
Dehya: Hah! I take it you all know each other already?
Paimon: Mm-hmm! We met this morning after the Adventurers' Guild pointed us to Asfand for more info.
Dehya: No kidding... So where's Rukh Shah? I thought I'd help these two out by asking about the theft. Anything you can tell 'em?
Asfand: Rukh Shah's gone over to the Akademiya. The Grand Sage recently ordered Sumeru City to begin bolstering its defenses, so people from all over have been called back to the city.
Asfand: Ahem, since you've already mentioned the theft, I suppose I might as well tell 'em what we know.
Dehya: Appreciate it, Chief!
Paimon: Uh, theft?... Sorry, what the heck are you guys talking about?
Dehya: Just recently, the Akademiya lost something... and there's a chance the item is connected with the Dendro Archon. This case might just somehow help you in meeting her.
Asfand: Heh, I suppose that's one way to look at it, but if ya ask me, the case is more about the Akademiya than anything else.
Asfand: Lemme fill ya in. The Akademiya recently sent a convoy to pick up an important package from Aaru Village. Word got out, and the convoy was robbed on its way back.
Asfand: The Grand Sage took the whole matter very seriously. Not only did he dispatch the matra, but also enlisted our help in the search for leads. All we know so far is that whatever was stolen is currently in Port Ormos.
Dehya: You two have heard of Port Ormos, haven't ya? It's the largest commercial port in all of Sumeru. You can travel there by leaving Sumeru City and heading south along the river.
Dehya: The Akademiya's grip isn't long enough to reach all the way to Port Ormos, so the city's a little more laid back, meaning the population's also a mixed bag. You never know who you'll meet there.
Asfand: Apparently, what was lost has a great deal to do with the Akasha, knowledge, and even the gods. I'm afraid I don't have any other details for ya, though...
Asfand: If you're interested, maybe you could head to Port Ormos and ask around yourselves. If you want my advice, try introducing yourselves as students of the Akademiya once you're there.
Traveler: Huh? Students of the Akademiya?
Dehya: Are ya serious, Chief? All the Akademiya students are in Sumeru City, you know... Why should they pretend to be students in Port Ormos?
Asfand: Heh, if you're all so interested, just go there and see what happens!
Dehya: Count me out. I've got plenty of work to do here for the Homayani family.
Dehya: And take it from me: If you two really do decide to visit Port Ormos, you'd best watch your backs. Let's just say that the Eremites there aren't nearly as friendly as those here in Sumeru City.
Dehya: There are even some extremists who go around shouting slogans like "Retake Sumeru for King Deshret!" Word is that more and more are joining their movement. They're becoming a real headache for Chief and the others.
Asfand: You bet they are. *sigh* King Deshret's been dead for thousands of years. Now they start spreading rumors of his return. Ridiculous!
Dehya: Not everyone's like you, Chief. Even the desert natives who abandoned their homes in the wilderness still wish to have a god of their own.
Dehya: #Well, Traveler, that's about all the information we have for you.
Paimon: Thanks, Dehya! And you too, Asfand.
Paimon: Since we've gathered all we could for the moment in Sumeru City, let's head to Port Ormos and see what we can find next.
Dehya: Miss Dunyarzad is looking forward to seeing you both at the Sabzeruz Festival, so be sure to get yourselves back here in time for that.
Traveler: Yep, we won't forget.
Dehya: Good. Then we'll see you both at the Sabzeruz Festival.
Traveler: Don't worry, we will.
Traveler: Why should we do that?

## Talk 20

Paimon: *sigh* Seems Asfand was right about most people's attitudes here...
Paimon: Not only are they not interested in the Dendro Archon, they even say stuff like, "If the Akasha doesn't think I should know, then I don't need to know about it."
Paimon: We've been asking for information non-stop ever since we got to Sumeru, but the harder we try, the more hopeless everything seems.
Paimon: Isn't there at least one person in this entire city who cares about Lesser Lord Kusanali?
Dunyarzad (???): Oh? You two are interested in Lesser Lord Kusanali?
Paimon: Huh? Who are you?
Dunyarzad (???): From the sound of it, you two are outlanders who recently arrived here. You've been asking around for information on Lesser Lord Kusanali, right?
Dunyarzad: Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot to introduce myself. I am Dunyarzad, one of Lesser Lord Kusanali's faithful followers!
Paimon: Whoa, really? Then do you know how we can meet with her?
Dunyarzad: I'm afraid I can't help you with that, but your conversation earlier did happen to remind me of a legend about the Dendro Archon.
Traveler: What sort of legend?
Traveler: Can you tell us the legend?
Dunyarzad: Sure. It goes like this: Long, long ago, there was a man who heard a prophecy. It predicted that a great calamity was about to befall him.
Dunyarzad: Panicked by what he heard, the man sought out the Dendro Archon in the hopes that she would bless him with the wisdom to help him escape his predicament.
Dunyarzad: The man journeyed across deserts and through rainforests, and experienced tribulations of every kind. However, he still couldn't find any trace of the Dendro Archon.
Dunyarzad: In despair, he thought, "Alas, the Archon has abandoned me!" He then had no choice but to sorrowfully resign to his fate.
Paimon: Okay... and then what happened?
Dunyarzad: And then... the calamity came! But to his own surprise, the man felt somehow emboldened by the trials of his journey. By relying on his own strength, he managed to overcome the adversity.
Dunyarzad: At that moment, a bird perched upon his shoulder. This bird was, in fact, an avatar of the Dendro Archon. She said:
Dunyarzad: "O archon-seeker, do you now understand? She and her wisdom have long been found by you."
Dunyarzad: "Along your journey, we were in every flower and blade of grass, every ray of sparkling sun, and every breath of dancing wind. So long as you continue to think and ponder, we'll be wherever you go."
Traveler: What an amazing story.
Paimon: Yeah, thanks for the story. Paimon feels all warm and fuzzy inside after that!
Dunyarzad: Hehe, in a way, it seems like this story is also one of the Dendro Archon's avatars.
Paimon: Dunyarzad, since you worship Lesser Lord Kusanali, can you tell us anything else about her?
Dunyarzad: Of course! So, did you two know that...
Dunyarzad: Uh... Umm, I'm terribly sorry, but it seems something's come up now. Let's chat another day!
Paimon: Hey, wait! What the heck just happened?
Traveler: I think it has something to do with those people over there.
Paimon: It looks like they're searching for someone... Hmm, Dunyarzad was acting super nervous just now. You think they're looking for her?
Paimon: This stinks! We finally managed to find a lead about Lesser Lord Kusanali. We can't let them get in the way now!
Paimon: Let's see if we can get rid of them. Then we can catch up with Dunyarzad!
Muruwa: Hey, have you two seen a brown-haired girl wearing a purple top and a long blue dress? We're lookin' for her.
Paimon: Did she have bandages wrapped around her wrists?
Muruwa: Yes, that's her! Did you see which direction she went?
Paimon: Oh, yeah, she went that way!
Muruwa: Quick! After her!
Paimon: Hehe, that should keep 'em busy for a while. Let's hurry and find Dunyarzad.

## Talk 21

Traveler: Think "Why doesn't the Akasha answer my question?"
Traveler: (A vague thought suddenly comes to mind... The Akasha doesn't unconditionally respond to every query.)
Traveler: (Also, even if the same query is requested by multiple people, the Akasha still imparts knowledge based on each person's identity, age, experiences, and other demographics.)
Paimon: Huh, could it be because we're outlanders and we've only just arrived in Sumeru? You know, maybe we're not qualified to receive an answer to this sort of question or something?

## Talk 22

Traveler: Think "Lesser Lord Kusanali."
Traveler: (Some knowledge began to trickle into my mind for a moment, but there wasn't really anything that I didn't already know.)
Paimon: Hmm, you too? Well, glad it's not just Paimon.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Rohawi: Anything else you'd like to ask about?
Traveler: About The Six Great Sages...
Rohawi: Sage is the highest rank for an Akademiya researcher. Since the institution's founding, each of The Six Great Sages represent the finest mind and leader of their respective Darshan.
Rohawi: One Grand Sage is chosen from among the six sages to serve as the head of the Akademiya. The current one is Sage Azar of the Rtawahist Darshan.
Rohawi: Since ancient times, the sages have contributed immensely to Sumeru. The widespread usage of the Akasha is thanks to their hard work.
Traveler: About the relationships between the sages.
Rohawi: Haha, I just knew you'd be curious about that!
Rohawi: Although the Six Darshans conduct research in different disciplines, their sages frequently interact with one another when managing Akademiya affairs.
Rohawi: In the Amurta, our leader is Sage Naphis. His temper is legendary — we researchers are terrified of him, and even the Grand Sage gives him some leeway.
Rohawi: He hasn't shown his face lately, though. Rumor has it that he's currently involved with some major project. Thankfully, he's been so busy that I was able to publish a paper.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Rohawi: See ya. Take a page out of my book and learn to look on the bright side of things.

### Additional Talk 2

Muruwa: Strange. Where did she go? She couldn't have made it far.
Hamasa: There's no way we can return to the master and mistress empty-handed. I'll ask around again.

### Additional Talk 3

Sharaf: Excuse me, sir. Have you seen a brown-haired girl wearing a purple top and a long blue dress?
Aftab: Eh? What did you say? ...Oh, yes, I have a granddaughter!
Sharaf: I wasn't asking about your granddaughter. I asked if you had seen a young woman go by!
Aftab: Ah yes, she and her parents settled down in Port Ormos... I haven't seen her in a long time.
Sharaf: Eh...

### Additional Talk 4

Collei: I hope you have a safe trip to Sumeru City and get to meet the Dendro Archon there.
Traveler: How're you feeling now?
Collei: I'm much better now. I'll be back on patrol again starting tomorrow.
Collei: Even though I'm not quite ready to help Master clear the Withering Zones yet, there are still plenty of other tasks for me to handle.
Collei: Oh, and Traveler? If you ever see Amber again during your travels, please don't mention my illness to her, okay?
Collei: Amber knows about my case of Eleazar and what's happened in my past, but I haven't told her about my condition getting worse...
Collei: I guess I just don't want her to worry about me. If the need arises, I'll tell her about it myself.
Paimon: Alright, we understand, Collei.
Traveler: About Pita Pockets...
Collei: Ha, kinda hard to believe that Master Tighnari can cook, isn't it?
Collei: His culinary techniques are very polished, but his taste is a little unusual... It's not really his fault, though. He just has a sensitive tongue and nose, so he prefers much lighter flavors.
Collei: The last time I went a little too heavy on the spices for my Pita Pockets, Master started having a sneezing fit! Of course, I never heard the end of it after that...
Traveler: Goodbye, Collei.
Collei: See you later. Be sure to come back often. Even though Master didn't admit it, I'm sure he wants to see you again.
