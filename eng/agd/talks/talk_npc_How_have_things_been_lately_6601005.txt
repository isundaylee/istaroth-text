Traveler: How have things been lately?
Chanca: Thanks for asking. Things have been going fine.
Chanca: Many old comrades have stopped by for meals since the battles ended. Though each of them still nurses injuries of their own, they all seem quite happy.
Chanca: ...Of course, it's possible that it's all just a front, and that they're hiding their discontent from me.
Chanca: Thanks to my old injuries, however, I can't really help them out anymore. The best I can do is treat them to a few more meals.
