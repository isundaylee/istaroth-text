# Floral Fresh


## Talk 1

Flora: These flowers aren't looking so good, either. What a shame...
Traveler: Something the matter?
Flora: Well, lots of people tend to buy single flowers to give as gifts, so I usually cut some flowers specifically for that purpose.
Flora: But the flowers I trim don't stay fresh for long. If they don't sell out, they'll wilt...
Flora: I've tried many methods in the past, but the flowers degrade by the end of the day all the same.
Flora: I wonder if there's any way to preserve those flowers for longer...
Traveler: Preservation, you say...
Flora: I've heard Sara from Good Hunter say that they put unused ingredients in a cool place, or preserve them using blocks of ice...
Flora: I've tried these methods too, but flowers stored using ice blocks always end up looking weird.
Flora: They won't have withered, but I wouldn't call them fresh either... and either way, they wouldn't be presentable anymore...
Flora: I asked a lot of people, and Mr. Sayid... You know who he is, right? He's that researcher.
Flora: One day, when he came to buy flowers, he told me that he once read about putting flowers in cold storage in a book.
Flora: Specifically... it involves using a container to store the flowers before placing that container near blocks of ice...
Flora: He also mentioned that if I wanted to do some experiments, the most suitable place would be the low-temperature environment on Dragonspine.
Flora: But I've heard that Dragonspine's a very dangerous place, and I couldn't find any adventurers willing to help me on such short notice...
Flora: Traveler, could you help me bury these three flower containers in the Dragonspine snow?
Traveler: Consider it done.
Flora: Thanks for your help. Let me think... I've heard that Dragonspine is huge, and has a lot of different regions, which could lead to very different results...
Flora: Perhaps a comparison might be in order...
Flora: Please help me place these flowers <color=#00E1FFFF>beside the Statue of The Seven</color>, <color=#00E1FFFF>beside the water</color>, and... <color=#00E1FFFF>at a cavern entrance</color>, then.
Traveler: Where should I bury them?
Traveler: Best to sell them all on the day itself, then.
Flora: That would be best. But there are always one or two flowers that don't get sold.
Flora: I know it's only one or two, but I don't want to just let them wither away.

## Talk 2

Flora: How are the flowers?
Traveler: Snugly underground.
Flora: Thank you. We'll leave them there on the mountain for a while.
Flora: Hehe, thanks so much for helping me out. Please, take these for your trouble.

Flora: Perhaps a comparison might be in order...
Flora: Alright, please help me place these flowers <color=#00E1FFFF>beside the Statue of The Seven</color> and <color=#00E1FFFF>at the entrance of a cavern on the mountain</color>.
Flora: Then I'd like you to find an area <color=#00E1FFFF>with water on the mountain</color>. Either a lake or a pool will do — just bury it by the water's edge.
Flora: Please be very careful not to damage them this time.
Traveler: Where should I bury them?
Traveler: Best to sell them all on the day itself, then.
Flora: That would be best. But there are always one or two flowers that don't get sold.
Flora: I know it's only one or two, but I don't want to just let them wither away.

## Talk 4

Flora: How are the flowers?
Traveler: I'm sorry...
Flora: Eh? What happened?
Traveler: I broke the containers and flowers by accident...
Flora: B—By accident!?
Flora: Ugh... I specifically picked those flowers out. You can't find such good flowers just anywhere...
Flora: Is Dragonspine so dangerous that even an adventurer like you couldn't keep one container from...
Flora: Still, thanks for making that trip for me. Please take these as thanks. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go tend to my flowers.
Flora: *sigh* Maybe I should try the method that Sara suggested after all...

Flora: Mr. Sayid really knows a lot. I wonder, do people keep flowers at Sumeru Akademiya too?
