Su Er'niang: Chop suey...?
Su Er'niang: I know, I know, the name sounds a little odd.
Su Er'niang: But Zhongyuan Chop Suey is a local specialty here in Chihu Rock.
Su Er'niang: It all starts with rinsed giblets that are chopped into mince meat. Then you add some Tiger Fish gelatin along with some starch and other ingredients, and roll it into meatballs.
Su Er'niang: After a quick deep fry, they're ready to be enjoyed. Not a hint of fish in that wonderful aroma!
Su Er'niang: But it sure is troublesome having to explain the name to every outlander that shows up to eat here, whew!
