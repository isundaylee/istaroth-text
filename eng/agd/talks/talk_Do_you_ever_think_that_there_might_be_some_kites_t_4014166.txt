Vlad: Do you ever think that there might be some kites that can no longer be retrieved after being sent up into the sky?
Nadia: I guess so? Even if you could control the line, the wind might decline your commands all the same.
Nadia: Speaking of that, should we go buy one? I mean, I haven't flown one before, so I'm not sure if it'll work out...
Vlad: Or... What say we make one together? I've seen kids discussing the patterns they want to draw on theirs, so it might not be that difficult.
Nadia: The two of us... Sure, let's give it a go!
