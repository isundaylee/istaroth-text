Bibo: Are you a fishmonger?
Bibo: Fishmonger? Are you trying to suss me out or something? No need, let me tell you how it is, plain and simple.
Bibo: Let's put it like this: I can get you whatever you need, from wherever it is â€” as long as the price is right.
Bibo: ...Except if it's from Inazuma. It's not about the money, I'm just not taking that kind of risk.
