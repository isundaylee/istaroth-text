Traveler: Anything else?
Eymen: And... And... I just managed to collect some "fine wine" every now and then for the business of the restaurant.
Eymen: Would you like to take some wine? Please take some, it's my sincere apology for what I did before.
Eymen: No wine? Then... Oh, I have this good sword given by an Eremite member. You can take that.
Eymen: Port Ormos is packed with people from all walks of life, you don't want to hang around here unguarded.
