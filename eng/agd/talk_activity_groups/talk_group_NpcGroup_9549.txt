Traveler: I've got other things to do right now...
Dehya: I'll be heading out soon, I still have a lot to take care of back in the brigade. Hmm... I should have enough time for one more game before I leave...

## Talk

Dehya: Hahaha, don't let it get to ya. I almost never lose when I'm playing with the mercs in my brigade. Hardly any of 'em can ever beat me.

## Talk

Dehya: Seems my luck ran out today... Hmm, maybe I used it up winning all that money off the others in the brigade?

Dehya: Alright, show me what you've got.

Traveler: Let me adjust my deck first...

Dehya: That was quite the game. You're not half bad... Who knows, a little more practice and you might be able to beat me.

## Talk

Dehya: I lost fair and square. Never thought you'd be even better than those old mercs I usually play against. Didn't see it coming at all.

## Talk

Dehya: Sure, I'll play... but I don't have anything valuable to bet with today. Guess it'll have to be a low-stakes game.
