Kuroda: Hello there. Welcome to Yae Publishing House, and welcome to the Magnificent Irodori Festival, run jointly by the Yae Publishing House and the Yashiro Commission.
Kuroda: It's just a shame that the writer of the prize-winning text "First Apprentice of Guhua" could not release a new volume in time for the festival. I doubt we'll be able to meet them this time...

Traveler: I'm looking to buy some books.
Kuroda: Thank you for your patronage! Feel free to look around!

Traveler: And you might be...?
Kuroda: My name is Kuroda... I'm actually the executive editor of Yae Publishing House. But the author I'm handling has yet to come up with any updates yet, so I'm pretty idle right now, so I figured, why not come down to the bookstore to help promote some books?
Kuroda: Have you found anything that strikes your fancy? Feel free to let me know.

Traveler: I'd like to know about Yae Publishing House.
Kuroda: Yae Publishing House is founded by Lady Yae Miko, the Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine. We mainly sell Light Popular Novels, which are more commonly known as Light Novels.
Kuroda: As you can see, the first floor is the bookstore, where we sell the books that we have published.
Kuroda: You must be an outlander, right? In that case, I highly recommend our local light novels. These are the most popular with young people nowadays.
Kuroda: Even some outlander authors have started to follow the trend of writing light novels now. They've even submitted some drafts to us.
Kuroda: Many light novel fans from other islands have traveled all the way here to buy books. They even call it a pilgrimage... Haha, well, I guess light novels are just that popular, huh?

Kuroda: Greetings! Welcome to Yae Publishing House.

Traveler: Someone sent me to find a couple of books...
Black Screen Text: You describe the books that Citlali wants to Kuroda.
Kuroda: The first edition of "Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden With Unlimited Power" and the limited deluxe edition of "Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?"...
Kuroda: I must say, your friend clearly knows a thing or two. In terms of collection value, nothing the Yae Publishing House is currently putting out can rival the books you're after.
Kuroda: To think I'm not acquainted with such a discerning reader... Truly regrettable.
Traveler: Are they still available?
Kuroda: You won't find either of them on the open market, and certainly not in storage. Every copy was snapped up long ago.
Kuroda: However, I do happen to have a copy of each...
Traveler: I can pay you for them.
Kuroda: No, no. These books would be far better off in your friend's possession, someone who can appreciate their true worth.
Kuroda: Knowing that, I'd be more than happy to give them to you.

Traveler: Who's the author you're in charge of...?
Kuroda: Hmm? Oh yeah, that reminds me. The author that I handle is an outlander as well. Have you ever heard of Mister Chang from Liyue? He once won an award in the "This Novel Is Amazing!" contest. "The First Apprentice of Guhua" is one of his well-known works.
Kuroda: ...You say you've met this person in Liyue before? Could it be a coincidence... Anyway, I originally wanted him to come up with a cooler pseudonym, but he refused to do that and insisted on using his real name.
Kuroda: Still, it's thanks to him that I've got the reputation I have as an editor. I only wish that he can find his muse soon and come up with some new works.
Kuroda: *sigh* If it weren't for the Sakoku Decree, I would have gone to Liyue to push... Uh, I mean, to visit him.
