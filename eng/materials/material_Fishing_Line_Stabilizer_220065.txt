# Fishing Line Stabilizer

A self-adaptive tension stabilizer that can be installed on a fishing rod to facilitate fishing. The device can automatically detect and record how hard different fish struggle. The more data it collects, the better the stabilizer works.

The device's prototype was the pointless invention of a Fontaine inventor that drew little interest for the longest time until the Fontaine Fishing Association discovered it and modified the product into the fishing line stabilizer used today. When the device first came out, it was most warmly received by the Association members, and now it has gradually been promoted in other regions.
It is an exceptionally hot commodity in the Snezhnayan market. Word has it that one of the Lord Harbingers is particularly fond of the product, which explains the hype.
