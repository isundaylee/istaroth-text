# The Beetle Battles Will Never End!

Grandmaster Hanakado: Hahahahaha...
Grandmaster Hanakado: Astounding!
Arataki Itto: Hahahahaha...
Arataki Itto: Amazing!
Grandmaster Hanakado: Even though your fighting style differs greatly from mine, I resonate strongly with the passion you imbue into your Onikabuto.
Grandmaster Hanakado: In time, you shall surely become a true champion of the beetle-fighting world.
Arataki Itto: You're pretty good yourself! You managed to win an impressive 570 out of our 1,141 matches!
Arataki Itto: Of all the beetle-battle marathons I've fought in my time, you've lasted the longest by far! Not gonna lie, I'm impressed!
Grandmaster Hanakado: No, I won 571 rounds, so I'm ahead. Also, you have the home advantage. Taking that into account, it is in fact I who am the superior warrior.
Arataki Itto: Huh? Why you gotta be so stubborn? I remember our score clear as day, and Mamoru is our witness!
Arataki Itto: Ain't that right, Mamoru?
Mamoru: Boss, I... I really can't take it anymore... Please let me sleep for a while...
Paimon: Uhh... Have they been going at it this whole time without a break!?
Paimon: Have they been going at it without a break!?
Traveler: The arena must be about to collapse...
Arataki Itto: Fine! Since I'm a generous guy, I can give you one round, no problemo. I'll just defeat you next time!
Arataki Itto: And if you're still not convinced, we'll do the next battle on your home turf. I'll prove that it's about the beetle fighter, not the location!
Grandmaster Hanakado: That suits me just fine. Follow me.
Arataki Itto: Oh? Hey, compadre, Flying Lavender Melon, you're finally here!
Paimon: Wait a minute, why's Paimon back to Flying Lavender Melon again? Does Paimon only get a good nickname when she's fighting for you?
Arataki Itto: Uh, never mind that for now! Here's your 2-month free ramen voucher, as agreed. Take it!
Paimon: Ramen voucher? Oh yeah, right! The ramen!
Paimon: Now that's more like it!
Traveler: Time to celebrate!
Arataki Itto: Oh, no, no, no, no. This was just the warmup. The Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl is still to come!
Arataki Itto: After all, things are way too quiet without an audience. We can't just end the event like this!
Arataki Itto: But the good news is, Grandmaster Hanakado finally let go of his pride and admitted that I'm a strong beetle fighter!
Arataki Itto: Still, we ain't done with each other just yet. I'll be heading to his home turf alone soon, where I'm gonna defeat him once and for all.
Arataki Itto: Once that happens, he'll have to follow my orders — and by that, I mean he'll help us make the Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl the biggest, baddest event ever!
Arataki Itto: Thanks again to the two of you. Now, wait here — I'll be back with good news in no time at all!
Paimon: Bull-Chucker sure seems like he's having fun, and we got two months' worth of ramen out of it, hee-hee!
Traveler: It's a win-win situation!
Akira: Boss, Boss! There's a letter from Shinobu. Take a look at this...
Akira: Huh? Where'd the Boss go? He was beetle fighting right here just a moment ago...
Paimon: Uh, is it urgent? Because Bull-Chucker just left with Grandmaster Hanakado. They said they were going to continue their battle...
Akira: Well, it's not urgent, just a little unexpected...
Akira: You can read it for yourself if you want.
Paimon: What the... So Grandmaster Hanakado is actually part of the Arataki Gang? But his... communication style made Bull-Chucker feel like he was facing a mortal enemy...
Paimon: Just as Shinobu expected, Bull-Chucker is spending all his time beetle fighting without resting or eating.
Paimon: But he did get us to organize the Beetle Brawl event for him...
Traveler: I still wouldn't really call that resting, per se.
Paimon: Y'know, Paimon thinks Shinobu deserves to enjoy the ramen voucher more than we do! Why don't we take her for ramen when she gets back?
Paimon: Hmm... Actually, wait a moment.
Paimon: Bull-Chucker didn't tell us which ramen stall this voucher's meant to be used at...
Paimon: ...Are we supposed to find the store by ourselves!?
Traveler: Everyone's happy, that's all that matters.
Traveler: And the "Extreme Beetle Brawl" is a wrap!
Traveler: The Onikabuto must be exhausted...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Grandmaster Hanakado: I see. I see... Let us battle once more. This time, I'll see through all of your methods.
Grandmaster Hanakado: Victory and defeat no longer seem so important... Let's just battle for fun, shall we?
Grandmaster Hanakado: It's rare that I should find such a great opponent. It would be a shame to end our battles so soon, would it not?
Arataki Itto: Sure! Bring it on!
Arataki Itto: But seeing through my secret beetle-fighting techniques? Nah, little fella, that ain't gonna happen!
Arataki Itto: If you'll admit that I'm the stronger beetle fighter, I'll fight you for as many rounds as you want!
Paimon: Huh, looks like Bull-Chucker and Grandmaster Hanakado are still raring to go... Well, let's leave them to it! They can battle beetles till the beetle-battling's done!
