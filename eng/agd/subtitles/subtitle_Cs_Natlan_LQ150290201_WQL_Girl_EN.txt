I linger between brushes of memory
Seeking the "color" of my final journey
When I get there
May there be feathers to paint the sky shades of rose
And fields of green to beckon adventurous souls
And azure oceans with which to sail into the unknown
And volcanos, too
Where, despite the danger
Hidden treasure waits to be found
And graffiti art, of course
Without that color
Just imagine the dullness of night...
Anything else?
In the end
I hope everyone remembers my color, too
In the end
I hope everyone remembers your color, too
All in all, it was just a technique for coloring a scroll
The task I'm entrusting to you...
Is much more than that
Farewell, my friend
Preserving these colors in memory...
That's the true duty of the appointed
That way, they're not lost to piles of black and white text
