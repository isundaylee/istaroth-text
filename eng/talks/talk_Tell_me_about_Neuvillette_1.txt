Traveler: Tell me about Neuvillette...
Aeife: Right! So, he's our Chief Justice, and the one who brought us Melusines to the Court of Fontaine to live.
Aeife: He's always very busy with work, and can only preside over some cases, and his subordinates in the Maison Ordalie handle the rest.
Aeife: But no matter how busy he is, he will still greet us when he sees us â€” just as he's done for several hundred years now.
