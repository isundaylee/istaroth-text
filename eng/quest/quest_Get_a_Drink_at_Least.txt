# Get a Drink at Least!


## Talk 1

Arouet: Hello, welcome! What would you like to have?
Arouet: Name the flavor you favor, then find a seat — coffee to savor will be with you in a beat.
Arouet: But a word to the wise — best to keep your distance from the other customers while you find your spot.
Traveler: So "one person, one table" is your style?
Arouet: Well, I wouldn't say so. On the contrary, those who drink coffee are dying to unburden themselves to a companion — if they were to get hold of you, you'd be here all day.
Traveler: You sound like you're describing drunkards...
Arouet: And would you believe me if I said that drunkards would be easier to handle? Call the police on them, and they'll sober up right away.
Arouet: But clarity is what the chatty gentlepeople here have in spades — and before one of you concedes, not even fists will shut their mouths.
Arouet: And that's why I advise you to keep your distance, or your early impression of our dear Fontaine may go ill.
Traveler: And why are they like... this?
Arouet: Now, if you were to ask me... Why, I'd say our coffee is so delicious that our customers can't help but slowly savor every sip. They could never bear to down it in one go!
Arouet: Then, unable to withstand the void created in their souls by the lack of our wondrous brew, they must find someone to speak to and pass the time... I jest, of course.
Arouet: A café is like a tavern — it is a place to relax. After a long day of work, few have any lack of complaints about how their day went, and such.
Arouet: Of course, I have little doubt that drinking wine is more effective than coffee — yet it comes with a risk that its counterpart lacks...
Arouet: If one takes to having a drink to go with any given complaint, one will be liable to drink too much and lose one's wits.
Traveler: That does go pretty badly, yes...
Arouet: Indeed. I once met someone from the Palais Mermonia. He's usually a polite, patient, and meticulous fellow.
Arouet: One day, he had too much to drink, and asserted that he was an apple tree, even shouting that someone had uprooted him and stripped him of his bark... Of course, he'd taken those clothes off himself.
Arouet: And then he searched high and low for tree pits, proclaiming loudly that he must return to the soil, else wither and perish.
Arouet: Fortunately, some quick-thinking fellow had us dig a pit right there, and when we were done, we pointed at it and hollered "What's this? We're missing an apple tree over here!"
Arouet: Hearing that, Mr. Apple Tree leaped into the trench like one hearing a siren, and even urged us to pile some soil atop him... In the end, he fell asleep with half his body still sticking out of the earth.
Arouet: Thus was peace restored... Though the person who came up with the idea did get a little unlucky...
Traveler: How so?
Arouet: Well, trouble was that he believed himself a shovel, and dug using his head while we were moving the soil.
Traveler: Do you have... other stories?
Arouet: *cough* Well, you're a curious sort — I suppose you'd like to have the hearsay without the hassle?
Arouet: As it happens, we're short-staffed at present, so if you'd be willing to help brew some coffee, I can take you on as a temporary employee.
Arouet: In that way, I'll have my succor, and you'll have your stories — and you can leave anytime. How does that sound?
Arouet: You'll be paid of course — to your satisfaction, that I guarantee.
Traveler: Sure, but...
Arouet: That's no issue, I'll teach you. I believe that with your powers of comprehension, brewing coffee will be little challenge — and mind you, I'm not a bad judge of character.
Arouet: Let me see...
Traveler: I'm not very good at making coffee...
Traveler: You seem to have a great deal of stories to tell...
Traveler: He sounds like a smart cookie to me.
Traveler: Is everyone here a solo drinker?

## Talk 2

Arouet: Ready to start blending some coffee?

## Talk 3

Traveler: (It's time to add the coffee brew's ingredients in...)

## Talk 4

Black Screen Text: The coffee is brewed in a precise and efficient manner...
Arouet: What stunning flavor, and what a rich aroma... Let me have a taste...
Arouet: Perfection! This flavor is perfect — you're a natural!
Traveler: Surely you exaggerate...
Arouet: Come now! It is precisely that unnecessary humility that has kept your talent buried. I'm sure of it!
Arouet: Congratulations! From now on, you're a proper coffee maker!
Arouet: Right, please take this cup, then. House rules state that every proper coffee maker must have their very own coffee cup.
Arouet: This cup will remain in the store — just use it whenever you stop by for a coffee.
Arouet: Once I'm ready, I'll talk to dear Mr. Macadell at the Coffee Management Office to have you noted down as an official coffee maker.
Arouet: Let's hope he's amenable... Hmph...

## Talk 5

Arouet: Hmm... There's something not quite right about this Latte...
Arouet: First, you'll need to mix <color=#00E1FFFF>one portion of coffee extract</color> and <color=#00E1FFFF>one portion of milk</color> together completely.
Arouet: After that, you need to cap it off with <color=#00E1FFFF>a serving of milk foam</color>... which I've already prepared for you. It's over there.
Arouet: Please try it again.

## Talk 6

Arouet: Your technique's all over the place today... Did something happen?
Arouet: It's alright. Leave the brewing to me this time.
Black Screen Text: Arouet starts brewing the coffee...
Arouet: Alright, please bring this to our customers...

## Talk 7

Arouet: This flavor is excellent — one might even call it perfect. Bring it to our customer as soon as possible. I'm sure she'll enjoy it!

## Talk 8

Arouet: Excellent! Our customers are most satisfied with your work. You do have a gift, if I do say so myself.
Arouet: If you have time in the future, please do come around more often — you'll be welcome as a guest and a coffee maker both.
Arouet: If you'll let me add my two Mora, I'd say that should you put in the work, it's only a matter of time before you become truly great at this.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: I'm ready.
Arouet: Very good. Then let's begin. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me again.

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: I've got other matters to attend to at the moment...
Arouet: Just tell me once you're ready. If you have any questions, just ask away.

### Additional Talk 3

Arouet: Ah, you don't have to make coffee for any of our guests today.
Arouet: You've helped out a lot at the store, and your brewing skills have been getting better by the day. To be honest, I'd say you're qualified to be an official coffee maker.
Traveler: So I've been unofficial all this time?
Arouet: Ah, I'm afraid we'll have to talk about the trouble that Mr. Macadell brought us.
Arouet: This fellow from the Palais has absolutely no knowledge about coffee, but he certainly is a master at making something out of nothing.
Arouet: He has requested that all cafés implement a system he designed, and that we accept the Palais Mermonia's supervision.
Arouet: To be more specific, the abilities of all employed coffee makers must be "assessed," and assigned a level from 1 to 5.
Arouet: This assessment not only includes a 27-page exam, but also a series of practical tests, ranging from basic to advanced.
Arouet: Once that process is complete, Mr. Macadell and his fellow make-work specialists will distribute level certificates to the coffee makers.
Arouet: Someone with a certificate is "official," and the opposite is true of those without.
Traveler: And what's the purpose of said certificate?
Arouet: As far as I and others in this line can see, not much, at least with regard to brewing coffee.
Arouet: It will not make someone's brew tasty or terrible, nor will it affect the maker's ability to make coffee.
Arouet: What it does do, however, is allow Mr. Macadell to set up a Coffee Management Office — under his personal banner again, no less — with a whole bunch of subordinates under him.
Traveler: So... will I need to take said exam?
Arouet: What? No, no, no. In truth, Mr. Macadell's system was suspended not five months into its implementation.
Arouet: According to his so-called testing standards, only a handful of people in all Fontaine would count as certified coffee makers.
Arouet: I mean, we all know this is a meaningless title, but the customers don't.
Arouet: If they hear that a café employs an uncertified coffee maker, then they might also think the café is an unlicensed establishment.
Arouet: The café owners who took losses as a result were very displeased.
Arouet: They banded together to send Mr. Macadell's office advisory letters... I think it came up to three a week.
Arouet: After a "sincere and frank discussion," they came to an agreement all parties were satisfied with.
Arouet: The assessment plan proposed by Mr. Macadell would not change, nor would the coffee maker designations.
Arouet: But the exam and the standard answers would be sent to all the various shop owners, with the practical operation assessment also being in their hands.
Arouet: After evaluating a coffee maker, the owners must also write an evaluative description and a promissory letter, before sending those to the Palais Mermonia.
Arouet: Finally, the Coffee Management Office will then send the certification to the coffee maker in question.
Arouet: Macadell has recently announced that the issuing of all physical certificates will be temporarily slowed to decrease office spending — certified coffee makers merely need to register with them in person.
Traveler: Wait, then this certification is completely pointless!
Arouet: Well, those gentlemen at the Palais Mermonia specialize in exactly these things. But don't you worry — I know what to do with the paper exam.
Arouet: However, according to my own house rules, any official coffee maker must be able to create their own special blend of coffee before they can take up the title.
Arouet: Come. Here are some ingredients that have never been used in brewing coffee — Marcotte, Rainbow Rose, and Lumidouce Bell.
Arouet: Pick one — I'd like to see what new coffee blend you'll be able to come up with.
Traveler: I'll go with Marcotte.
Arouet: Hmm, an interesting thought — to use this plant to make coffee. Very daring indeed.
Arouet: Good. I'll help you process the ingredients, and then you can start.
Traveler: Let's do Rainbow Rose.
Traveler: I pick Lumidouce Bell.
Traveler: Well, you sure went on a long tangent...
Traveler: I'm not exactly an exam expert.
Traveler: There are unofficial coffee makers?

### Additional Talk 4

Arouet: It seems that your calm's been disturbed. Your technique is a jumble, and no mistake.
Arouet: It's alright, it happens to the best of us. Learn to relax — this is a cup of coffee, not life and death.
Arouet: Believe me, you have talent, you just need to stay calm, and you'll do fantastic work.

### Additional Talk 5

Arouet: Ah, you're finally here. I've been hanging on by a thread here, just so you know! Come, get behind the counter.
Traveler: Lots of customers, I presume?
Arouet: Oh, you bet, and unexpectedly so! We haven't had an empty seat since the day you came to help out.
Arouet: I mean, what did I tell you? You're a natural! If you're willing, you can just stay here and help me.
Arouet: If things go well, I might even be able to help you open a branch of your own!
Traveler: I've got other things I must do...
Arouet: Alright, alright, you busy bee. You were running like the wind last I saw you pass the store by — why, one would think you were being pursued, the way you ran!
Arouet: But since you're here, I suppose that a slot's opened up?
Traveler: You could say that.
Arouet: Wonderful. Let me see, then...
Traveler: Enough to brew up some coffee, anyway.
Traveler: The Adventurers' Guild has loads of work waiting for me...

### Additional Talk 6

Arouet: Chatelet just ordered a <color=#00E1FFFF>Latte</color>.
Arouet: First, you'll need to mix <color=#00E1FFFF>one portion of coffee extract and milk each</color> completely, before capping it off with <color=#00E1FFFF>a serving of milk foam</color>.
Arouet: Milk foam is a special ingredient we've got here. Making it involves preparing another serving of milk, washing and drying this tube here at the coffee machine...
Arouet: Before stabbing the tube into the milk at this angle... Uh, you know what, I'll just help you make that. It's a bit much to ask a beginner to make the foam...

### Additional Talk 7

Arouet: Officer Menthe seems to have something important to do. She's ordered a cup of <color=#00E1FFFF>Clarity Coffee</color>.
Arouet: You need <color=#00E1FFFF>one portion of coffee and drinking water each</color>. Take the cup with coffee in it and pour the water in, and you're done. Easy peasy, eh?
Arouet: Now, I can't say I'm fond of this rather flippant way of making coffee, what with it ignoring flavor and all...
Arouet: But it is very quick, and it only requires coffee extract and water. There's no milk or any other ingredients, so its energizing effects are very apparent...
Arouet: Which makes it perfect for someone who's constantly having to power through physical and mental exhaustion at work every day.
Arouet: *sigh* That Officer Menthe...

### Additional Talk 8

Arouet: Chatelet seems to be in a good mood today. She's ordered <color=#00E1FFFF>a cup of Milk Coffee</color>.
Arouet: You'll need <color=#00E1FFFF>one portion of coffee extract</color> and <color=#00E1FFFF>milk</color> each. After mixing the two, you'll need to add some <color=#00E1FFFF>cream</color> over the top to finish it up.
Arouet: Have you tried our specially-made cream? It smells really good, is as soft as a cloud, and isn't too sweet...
Arouet: Huh? Oh, don't worry, you won't have to make any yourself — just use the stock we have in the store. I was just introducing it to you, that's all...

### Additional Talk 9

Arouet: Officer Menthe appears to have encountered something troublesome... She's ordered an <color=#00E1FFFF>Espresso</color>.
Arouet: You just need to mix these <color=#00E1FFFF>two portions of coffee</color> together to make it, and add some dessert on the side. As I recall, she's fond of cakes.
Arouet: *sigh* She seems more tired than ever...

### Additional Talk 10

Arouet: Hmm... There's something off about this Clarity Coffee...
Arouet: You need <color=#00E1FFFF>one portion of coffee</color> and <color=#00E1FFFF>drinking water</color> each. Take the cup with coffee in it and pour the water in, and you're done.
Arouet: Please try it again.

### Additional Talk 11

Arouet: Hmm... There's something not quite right about this Milk Coffee...
Arouet: You'll need <color=#00E1FFFF>one portion of coffee extract</color> and <color=#00E1FFFF>milk</color> each to make it. Finally, after mixing the two, you'll need to add some <color=#00E1FFFF>cream</color> over the top to finish it up.
Arouet: Please try it again.

### Additional Talk 12

Arouet: Hmm... There's something odd about this Espresso...
Arouet: You just need to mix these <color=#00E1FFFF>two portions of coffee</color> together, and you're done.
Arouet: Please try it again.

### Additional Talk 13

Arouet: Have you finished making the coffee?
Traveler: Remind me about how to make Lattes again...
Arouet: First, you'll need to mix <color=#00E1FFFF>one portion of coffee extract</color> and <color=#00E1FFFF>one portion of milk</color> together completely.
Arouet: After that, you need to cap it off with <color=#00E1FFFF>a serving of milk foam</color>... which I've already prepared for you. It's over there.
Traveler: See you.
Arouet: I'm looking forward to the coffee that you'll make.

### Additional Talk 14

Arouet: Is something the matter?
Traveler: Remind me how to make Clarity Coffee again.
Arouet: You need <color=#00E1FFFF>one portion of coffee and drinking water each</color>. Take the cup with coffee in it and pour the water in, and you're done. Easy-peasy.
Traveler: See you.
Arouet: I'm looking forward to the coffee that you'll make.

### Additional Talk 15

Arouet: What can I do for you?
Traveler: Could you go over the method for making Milk Coffee...
Arouet: You'll need <color=#00E1FFFF>one portion of coffee extract</color> and <color=#00E1FFFF>milk</color> each. After mixing the two, you'll need to add some <color=#00E1FFFF>cream</color> over the top to finish it up.
Traveler: See you.
Arouet: I'm looking forward to the coffee that you'll make.

### Additional Talk 16

Arouet: What can I do for you?
Traveler: Could you run me through the method of making Espresso again...
Arouet: You just need to mix these <color=#00E1FFFF>two portions of coffee</color> together — and if Officer Menthe comes along, pair it with a cake.
Traveler: See you.
Arouet: I'm looking forward to the coffee that you'll make.
