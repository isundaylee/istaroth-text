# Gold Devouring and Mora Gathering


## Talk 1

Hatim: Let me think... Which should I pick?
Traveler: What are you doing?
Hatim: Oh, I'm wondering what today's "Golden Dish" is going to be.
Paimon: A "Golden Dish"? Is that... food that's made of gold?
Hatim: No, it's a great dish that will increase the affinity of those who consume it for Mora!
Paimon: Paimon wants to eat it too! Wait... But how can there be such a thing?
Hatim: Haha, come, there is much you do not know.
Hatim: Let's take Liyue's Mora Meat as an example. This renowned dish was named after money, and this of course strongly implies an association with financial fortune.
Hatim: And there's Butter Chicken too! Its sumptuous oil just conjures up the image of a full wallet.
Hatim: Another example is Mondstadt's "Pile 'Em Up"! From the name itself, it is surely a symbol of rising wealth.
Hatim: So if you eat this kind of dish, then go to the Kalimi Exchange to buy some futures contracts, you'd be sure to make a killing!
Paimon: The explanation sounds sort of contrived...
Traveler: What are futures contracts anyway?
Hatim: Never bought 'em, have you? Hmm... Let me explain it to you. It's a kind of futures trading that corresponds to spot trading. For example, this little one next to you...
Paimon: Paimon is Paimon! Not some "little one"!
Hatim: Hahaha! Then, little Paimon, what do you like?
Paimon: Huh? Paimon likes... Um... Slimes!
Hatim: Hahaha! Alright, then! Let's suppose I have a type of Slime Condensate in my hand, priced at 100 Mora a bottle.
Hatim: If you buy 500 bottles of Slime Condensate from me for 50,000 Mora today, that would be considered a spot deal.
Paimon: Th—That's too many! Paimon can't eat all of that!
Hatim: This is just an analogy... Suppose you buy 500 bottles today. However, you can't guarantee that you will buy that much Slime Condensate from me every day, right?
Paimon: Um... Well, Paimon's not gonna buy any if she's too full.
Hatim: That's right, and I for my part can't guarantee that I will be able to supply you with that much Slime Condensate whenever you want.
Hatim: So, this is when futures come into play. Futures are not your run-of-the-mill face-to-face trading, but a "trading agreement."
Hatim: "Buying a bottle of Slime Condensate" and "selling a bottle of Slime Condensate" are both types of "trading agreements."
Hatim: When I can supply Slime Condensate, I will submit a "trading agreement" to the Futures Exchange to sell that condensate.
Hatim: When you need the Slime Condensate, you can go to the Futures Exchange and check the "trading agreements" to see who's selling it.
Hatim: "Futures trading" involves cleverly buying and selling these "trading agreements" to reap profits.
Hatim: Of course, this is just an analogy. If Slime Condensate was really traded on the futures market, all wild slimes would now be extinct.
Paimon: Wow... Amazing...
Traveler: Uh... I don't get it...
Hatim: However! The futures market is ever-changing, and even a seasoned veteran such as I cannot guarantee that the futures I buy will profit.
Hatim: But if you eat the "Golden Dish" that brings fortune before buying your futures, the situation will be different. The only question is... Which one should I eat today?
Hatim: Ah, hold on, I didn't notice earlier, but your hair... It's actually the color of gold! Dazzling! Dazzling, I say!
Hatim: Gold is a symbol of wealth, and so the dish *you* choose will surely bring me lots of fortune!
Hatim: Why don't you help me choose a "Golden Dish"? I will repay you well.
Hatim: I'll give you extra perks too if I make Mora off this. How about it?
Traveler: But what if you lose...?
Hatim: Hahaha! Don't worry, I, the exceptionally rich Hatim of Kalimi, hereby declare that you shall get a share of any profits and that all losses will be fully borne by me, so you can rest assured.
Traveler: I see.
Hatim: Come, make the choice for me, then. *Mora Meat*, *Butter Chicken*, or *"Pile 'Em Up"*, which one is the real Golden Dish?
Traveler: Why not eat all three?
Hatim: Mix up all the good ingredients, and you shall end up with a dish most dubious. This happens distressingly often, does it not?
Hatim: Fortune is like that too. Eating all of them will only be counterproductive, so we must choose the most effective "Golden Dish" to consume!

## Talk 2

Hatim: How's about it, then? *Mora Meat*, *Butter Chicken*, or *Pile 'Em Up*? Let me hear your choice.

## Talk 3

Hatim: Oh, I can smell it! This dish smells like... wealth! Yes, it smells like gold! I shall make a killing this time, yes indeed!
Hatim: Thank you so much. Now, I shall go to my "Wealth Spot" later and eat this "Golden Dish." Just wait to hear good news from me, you two!
Traveler: "Wealth Spot"?
Hatim: This is another one of my secret ways to get rich, and like the "Golden Dish," this is a good location that can bring me fortune.
Hatim: See the city gate over there? Countless merchants carry their goods and Mora through it every day... That place must be teeming with fortunes.
Hatim: Also, the area around the Exchange is also where Mora gathers. If you spend lots of time in such places, you will be blessed with wealth!
Paimon: You have so many strange theories.
Traveler: This all seems rather baseless...
Hatim: Hahaha! Strange or not, nonsense or not, any theory that makes me Mora is a good one.
Hatim: Okay, I'm ready to embrace my fortune. Wait for good news from me, Traveler!

## Talk 4

Hatim: This dish seems quite excellent indeed. Ah, it fills me with confidence!
Hatim: Thank you so much, Traveler. I shall eat this "Golden Dish" at my "Wealth Spot" later. Wait to hear good news from me, you two!
Traveler: "Wealth Spot"?
Hatim: This is another one of my secret ways to get rich, and like the "Golden Dish," this is a good location that can bring me fortune.
Hatim: See the city gate over there? Countless merchants carry their goods and Mora through it every day... That place must be teeming with fortunes.
Hatim: Also, the area around the Exchange is also where Mora gathers. If you spend lots of time in such places, you will be blessed with wealth!
Paimon: You have so many strange theories.
Traveler: This seems like baseless nonsense...
Hatim: Hahaha! Strange or not, nonsense or not, any theory that makes me Mora is a good one.
Hatim: Okay, I'm ready to embrace my fortune. Wait for good news from me, Traveler!

## Talk 5

Hatim: This dish seems a little strange, but I... believe in you!
Hatim: Thank you so much. Now, I shall go to my "Wealth Spot" later and eat this "Golden Dish." Just wait to hear good news from me, you two!
Traveler: "Wealth Spot"?
Hatim: This is another one of my secret ways to get rich, and like the "Golden Dish," this is a good location that can bring me fortune.
Hatim: See the city gate over there? Countless merchants carry their goods and Mora through it every day... That place must be teeming with fortunes.
Hatim: Also, the area around the Exchange is also where Mora gathers. If you spend lots of time in such places, you will be blessed with wealth!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Hatim: Let me think... Which should I pick?
Hatim: Ah, Traveler, you're back! Wonderful!
Paimon: You're not picking a Golden Dish again, are you?
Hatim: Hahaha, a clever little brain you have! That's right. I'm about to pick one Golden Dish to rule all futures markets!
Hatim: So, help me out again, would you?
Traveler: Understood. Same rules as always?
Hatim: That's right! It's been a pleasure working with you. Please make your choice then... *Mora Meat*, *Butter Chicken*, or *Pile 'Em Up* — which one is the real Golden Dish?
Traveler: Wait, what even is a Golden Dish?
Hatim: A fabulous dish that will increase the affinity of those who consume it for Mora!
Hatim: Let's take Liyue's Mora Meat as an example. This renowned dish was named after money, and this of course strongly implies an association with financial fortune.
Hatim: And there's Butter Chicken too! Its sumptuous oil just conjures up the image of a full wallet.
Hatim: Another example is Mondstadt's "Pile 'Em Up"! From the name itself, it is surely a symbol of rising wealth.
Hatim: So if you eat this kind of dish, then go to the Kalimi Exchange to buy some futures contracts, you'd be sure to make a killing!
Hatim: So, please make your choice for the sake of my "futures trading" venture. Which will it be? *Mora Meat*, *Butter Chicken*, or *Pile 'Em Up*?
Traveler: Wait, what are futures contracts anyway?
Hatim: Basically, it's a future transaction, as opposed to a spot deal. Now, suppose I have a type of Slime Condensate in my hand, priced at 100 Mora a bottle.
Hatim: Say you buy 500 bottles of Slime Condensate from me for 50,000 Mora. This is a spot deal.
Hatim: But you can't be sure that you will make this same purchase every day, and I can't ensure that I can supply you all the time either, yes?
Hatim: So, this is where futures come into play. Futures are not your run-of-the-mill, face-to-face trading, but a "trading agreement."
Hatim: "Buying a bottle of Slime Condensate" and "selling a bottle of Slime Condensate" are both types of "trading agreements."
Hatim: When I can supply Slime Condensate, I will submit a "trading agreement" to the Futures Exchange to sell that condensate.
Hatim: When you need the Slime Condensate, you can go to the Futures Exchange and check the "trading agreements" to see who's selling it.
