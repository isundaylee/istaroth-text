Yanbo: Nothing, really. I don't believe that the Fatui would make such a huge fuss over foodstuffs. You've also faced them before â€” I'm sure you know that they aren't simple opponents to deal with. These devious fellows must have some other goal in mind.
Yanbo: Whatever the case, it seems that we have foiled their scheme. Thanks for your help. The Millelith will not forget it.
