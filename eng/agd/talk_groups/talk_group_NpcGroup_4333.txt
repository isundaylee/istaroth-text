Traveler: Are you alright?
Banka: Me? I'm fine, completely fine.
Banka: It's Kumar, my younger brother... His body is frail, and he needs to rest and recuperate in a place with a lot of trees.
Banka: Before he fell sick, I used to sell in the city the quarries I hunted. But I have to look after him now, so I rarely leave the village unless it's to get medicine in the city.
Banka: Sometimes, getting ill or not is beyond our control... He's still so young, so I just hope he gets well soon.

Traveler: Things will get better.
Banka: Hehe, I know it's just a polite gesture, but it's still comforting.
Banka: Hope Lesser Lord Kusanali will hear our wishes as my little brother always prays.

## Talk 3

Banka: Do you think that city life would be best, or if staying in Vimara Village will be better?

Traveler: Are you planning to move into the city?
Banka: Me? Well, I'm fine right where I am.
Banka: It's Kumar, my younger brother, that I'm talking about here. Now, it's pretty much a fact that the Dendro Archon has cured everyone suffering from Eleazar, Kumar being one of them.
Banka: And now that he's well, I suppose it's about time that he made some plans for the future.
Banka: He's got a long list of things that he wants to try, but I've got a feeling that going to the city to study might open a better path for him than staying here or going out on adventures.
Banka: If he can become a researcher or something of the order, he won't have to want for anything again.

Traveler: Ask him what he thinks.
Banka: Yeah, you're right. It's his life, after all, so should it be his decision.
Banka: There's plenty of time, so there's no need for us to rush.
Banka: Look, here's something he brought back recently. Most of these flowers grow in high places. He would never have been able to pick them before — that would have been unthinkable.
