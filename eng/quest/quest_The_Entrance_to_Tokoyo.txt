# The Entrance to Tokoyo


## Talk 1

Paimon: Phew, it sure took a while before we saw anything resembling civilization. Let's get closer and have a look.

## Talk 2

Paimon: The five symbols on this big door must be the Key Sigils.
Paimon: Let's have a look around. From what we've experienced in the past, we'll probably need to do something else first.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Wow! Paimon never thought that there'd be such a huge place underneath Watatsumi Island!
Paimon: Looks like our goal is that place in the middle.
Paimon: #Alrighty then, Traveler. Let's head in. Steadily now...
Paimon: Those ruins seem to be closer to us. Let's start there!
Paimon: Buildings means people... once upon a time, anyway. And where there's people, there'll be writing!
Paimon: And where there's writing and paper, there'll be those... hints that we can't even read.

## Talk 4

Scribbled Notes: (A piece of paper that has become crinkled due to the damp environment in the cavern. There are words on it, which you can read.)
Scribbled Notes: "I traveled together with Watatsumi's chosen hero this time. We discovered that the Bathysmal Vishaps had suddenly become active."
Scribbled Notes: "However, the clerk from the Sangonomiya Shrine convinced us to spare them. As it turns out, the people of Watatsumi were feeding these creatures when they threw food offerings into the Moon-Bathed Deep."
Scribbled Notes: "He even said that they could no longer pose any threat to humanity, so it was best that Enkanomiya be returned to them."
