Kirara: Komaniya Express, at your service! Oh, it's you!
Traveler: What are you doing...
Kirara: Festival delivery! Let's say you buy a bunch of stuff at a stall... Who wants to carry it around for the rest of the night?
Kirara: That's where Komaniya Express comes in! Entrust your stuff to us, and we'll deliver your festival purchases straight to your door!
