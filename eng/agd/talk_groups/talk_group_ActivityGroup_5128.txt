Vinayak: Brave adventurer, are you ready to go collect those components?
Traveler: I'm ready.
Vinayak: Excellent! In that case, I leave this matter in your hands.
Traveler: Not yet.
Vinayak: Alright then. Planning ahead is good for efficiency, after all. But don't end up like Shriya, ever planning but never executing.

## Talk 1

Vinayak: Brave adventurer, are you ready now?
Traveler: I'm ready.
Vinayak: Excellent, excellent! Then let us begin.
Traveler: Not yet.
Vinayak: Alright then. Planning ahead is good for efficiency, after all. But don't spend all your time planning and not executing, like some people.
Shriya: Hey! What's that supposed to mean!? Are you itching for another debate? I'll prove you wrong, I will!

## Talk 2

Vinayak: Brave adventurer, are you ready to operate the Wenutslayer Cannon?
Traveler: I'm ready.
Vinayak: Alright! Sandstorm's whipping up now. Everyone to your positions!
Traveler: Not yet.
Vinayak: Alright then. Planning ahead is good for efficiency, after all. But don't spend all your time planning and not executing, like some people.
Shriya: Hey! What's that supposed to mean!? Are you itching for another debate? I'll prove you wrong, I will!

## Talk 3

Vinayak: If Shriya's hypotheses are correct, this will be the Wenutslayer Cannon's most critical battle. Brave adventurer, are you ready?
Traveler: I'm ready.
Vinayak: Alright then, let us begin! Let us prove to all of Sumeru that this cannon isn't just a pretty face!
Traveler: Not yet.
Vinayak: Alright then. Planning ahead is good for efficiency, after all...
Shriya: Huh. Is it just me, or has your attitude improved a little?

## Talk 4

Vinayak: ...Well, there are still some affected Wenut nearby. If you've got the time, please help take care of them.
Traveler: That's what I'm here for.
Vinayak: Wonderful! Why, this is the best opportunity to test the full output of the Wenutslayer Cannon, if I do say so myself!
Traveler: Maybe next time.
Vinayak: Sure. Just come to me when you have the time.

## Talk 5

Shriya: That idiot...! Who even comes to a café just to write reports!?
Traveler: Why are you here by yourself?
Shriya: Ugh, let's not talk about that half-witted gearhead! The sun must've baked my brains out for me to have believed that he'd seen the light!
Shriya: The last time we agreed to meet at a café, I spent half a day to get ready, and even changed into a brand new set of clothes...
Shriya: And the first thing he said when he saw me was "Did you bring the materials and writing tools?"
Shriya: Argh! He should just... stay with his precious machines forever! They'll keep him company, I'm sure!
Traveler: Where did Vinayak hop off to?
