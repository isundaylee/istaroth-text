Traveler: New mushrooms?
Arachatora: It's said that, somewhere far, far away, there are mushrooms that have the color of fallen leaves and grow on the feet of pine trees.
Arachatora: There's another kind of mushrooms. They are as blue as the sky. They glitter at moonrise.
Arachatora: That mushroom and the "Head Mushroom," which tastes better?
Arachatora: #For this "special cooking training," I want to find those mushrooms, and use them to cook the supreme delicacy for Nara {NICKNAME}.
