# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Layla: Things I want to do? Let's see, where to start...
Layla: Hmm... I can think of a dozen things just off the top of my head. Take a really nice nap, walk all around this beautiful place...
Layla: But if you mean what I want to do most, right here and now, then... I guess it'd be to simply do nothing.
Traveler: Nothing at all?
Layla: Oh! Uh, I mean, you're so nice and all, and everything here just makes me feel so comfortable...
Layla: I didn't mean there's anything wrong with this place. That's not what I'm trying to say at all!
Traveler: It's okay, just speak your mind.
Layla: Ahem... Okay, thanks...
Layla: ...As you can see, I lack confidence no matter what I do, there's always something worrying me.
Layla: I'm under a lot of pressure, and it really stresses me out... I don't know if I'm studying hard enough, or how my future will turn out...
Layla: Whether it's studying, or even just life in general... There are so many things I have yet to get the hang of.
Layla: And I'm always scared that I'll miss something important... Ugh, I'll never be able to forgive myself if that happens!
Layla: It's exhausting, but I guess you already saw that... Which is probably why you suggested I take a vacation aâ€”and get some proper rest, right?
Traveler: Yes, I could tell you needed it.
Layla: Hehe, well, at least I was smart enough to figure that out...
Layla: ...And to realize that I should really take you up on your offer, and make sure I get a good rest for once!
Layla: Whew, alright, it's decided... my mind needs a rest. So I'm not going to do anything, or worry about anything at all.
Traveler: Here, come with me...
Layla: Perfect! Let's go relax and just let the day pass by!
Traveler: I'll find a nice patch of grass for us to lie on for a while.
Traveler: Why'd you say so?
