Traveler: Is there anything of note nearby?

Damestier: *cough* Well, if you're not interested in the Mekafish in the water, then I haven't much else I can tell you about.

## Talk

Damestier: Oh, I just can't handle these Mekafish...

Traveler: Mekafish?
Damestier: The ones swimming about in the water.
Damestier: I was part of the research team that developed them. The original idea was to have them clean up trash and junk from the water.
Damestier: But a few problems emerged during development, and the Mekafish started treating everything that wasn't the water itself as "junk" and cleaning it all up...
Damestier: We planned to turn them off remotely and retrieve them, then figure out what the problem was... But we never imagined the Institute would... y'know, explode...

Traveler: Mekafish?
Damestier: Hello, Honorary Senior Researcher. I mean the ones swimming about in the water.

Traveler: See you.
Damestier: Goodbye. I hope no more reporters come to interrogate me. I mean, what am I supposed to do...

Traveler: What happened afterwards?
Damestier: *sigh* ...Most of my research team perished in the blast. Only a few survived. I was one of the survivors, obviously.
Damestier: But... Well, none of us survivors really understood the core technology, so we couldn't control the Mekafish. And we couldn't just start the research over again, either...
Damestier: All we could do was stand around watching the malfunctioning ones swimming out of control, and the broken ones just floating there.
Damestier: And just then, a bunch of reporters turned up demanding to know why we weren't doing anything about the chaos...
Damestier: But I wanted to help! I'd love to retrieve the Mekafish! But... But I don't know how!
Damestier: Oh, what should I do... Can't anyone help me...

Traveler: I spot some people trying to catch Mekafish...
Damestier: Oh, that... Technically, that's not fishing, but guiding Mekafish to designated spots with a specialized flashing gadget.
Damestier: It's intended for the regular maintenance of the Mekafish... I still have some here. You can try it out if you're interested.
