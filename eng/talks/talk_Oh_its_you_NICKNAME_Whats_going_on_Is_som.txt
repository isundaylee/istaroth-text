# Talk Dialog

Jeht: #Oh, it's you, {NICKNAME}. What's going on? Is something wrong?
Traveler: About the Eternal Oasis...
Jeht: It's all thanks to you that we managed to get to the Eternal Oasis. Without your help, we would have never been able to open the path.
Jeht: I don't even know how to thank you... Next time we start a bonfire, we should talk about this by the flames. It'll be just like...
Jeht: Just like that time with Azariq... Ah...
Jeht: ...That traitorous dog...
Traveler: I'm sorry...
Jeht: You've got nothing to be sorry about... I wasn't mad at you.
Jeht: Honestly, the Matriarch had already warned me to keep my guard up before we left. I might be careless â€” well, just a bit. But I'm not stupid.
Jeht: The schematics of that ancient machine... Not sharing that with the tribe was a crime. The moment I realized that, I started suspecting him.
Jeht: What I didn't expect, though, was his willingness to keep pursuing his schemes even after all the time we spent around each other... He really thought he could manipulate me...
Jeht: I feel disgusted just thinking about it...
Jeht: Thankfully, Matriarch Babel has always been on my side. I believe that she can help the tribe find prosperity again.
Jeht: She will. Absolutely.
Jeht: And you! You've always been in my corner as well!
Traveler: Yeah. I'm a Jeht-person too, you know!
Jeht: Jeht-person? That sounds so... weird. Like a nickname Paimon might give.
Jeht: #But seriously, thanks, {NICKNAME}... Really.
Traveler: What if I come into conflict with the Matriarch?
Jeht: ...
Jeht: Ha! You're kidding. You're the Tanit's esteemed guest, the one who brought the Mother of the Jinn back and found the path to the Eternal Oasis...
Jeht: I can't think of any reason why you and the Matriarch might come into conflict.
Traveler: Never mind...
Jeht: Yeah, so... If you ever need my help, just let me know.
