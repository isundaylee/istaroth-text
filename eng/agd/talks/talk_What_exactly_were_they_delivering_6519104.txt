Traveler: What exactly were they delivering...?
Chourei: I remember one of the ships was a tea clipper from Liyue, and the other was carrying spices from Sumeru.
Chourei: Speaking of tea, I've heard that there's a delicacy in Liyue where they boil a bird's egg and then crack part of the shell.
Chourei: Once they've done that, they soak it in tea along with various seasonings. The egg absorbs the aroma of the tea and produces a unique and layered flavor.
Chourei: I wonder if there are any clever minds in Fontaine that can replicate this delicacy. I'd really like to taste it.
