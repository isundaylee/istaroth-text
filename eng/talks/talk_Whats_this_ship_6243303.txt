Traveler: What's this ship?
Juza: This beauty here is the flagship of our very own Crux Fleet, the Alcor!
Juza: She's sturdy, she's armed to teeth, and she's the speediest ship to sail Liyue's seas!
Juza: Basically, it's our most eye-catching vessel. Pirates look upon it and flee in terror at the sight!
Juza: Of course, we aren't just famous for this boat. More importantly, we've got Captain Beidou and all the lads.
Juza: They might make like a rowdy, joking lot, but when the going gets tough, they shut up and get cracking!
Juza: You'll know what I mean if you ever get the chance to go out to sea with us.
