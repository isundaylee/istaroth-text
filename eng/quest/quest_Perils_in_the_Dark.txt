# Perils in the Dark

Fatuus' Journal: "...Staff Sergeant Anton has discovered a large bell to the southeast. The rock walls have "their" script all over it..."
Fatuus' Journal: "...This is very similar to the large bell that the Captain discovered in the ruins to the northwest. Perhaps..."
Fatuus' Journal: "...We dispatched Snezhevna and Fadeyka to ring the two bells in their respective corners..."
Fatuus' Journal: "...As the terrifying tolls reverberated through the stone, the black fog dissipated. What a strange phenomenon... it's almost like the bells were announcing someone's arrival..."
Fatuus' Journal: "...Ten were lost, two vanguard squads took immense damage. The Captain ordered a retreat..."
Fatuus' Journal: (A simple map falls out from the diary. The map marks out the two bells in the northwest and the southeast, with two ominous skulls to go with them.)
