# The Shadows Deepen


## Talk 1

Paimon: The time has come! Let's go meet Albedo at the camp!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Rocks? Ah! And what are these boars also doing here!?

## Talk 3

Paimon: Yay, dinner's ready!
Paimon: Food's ready, everyone! Come on, let's eat!
Albedo: I made a few dishes based on some popular Mondstadt recipes. This is no Good Hunter, but there should be enough to go around.
Albedo: Please, help yourselves.
Bennett: Wow, smells great! Don't mind if I do!
Eula: Wait, don't steal all the fried vegetables. Leave some for me! ...Hey!
Paimon: Ah... Paimon's full. What a great meal!
Bennett: Albedo, you're too modest. These dishes are as good as anything you'd find in a top restaurant. Are all alchemists so good at cooking?
Eula: You may be onto something there.
Paimon: Right? Paimon thinks so, too! It's his lab manner that gives it away — the kind of guy who holds a potion bottle as steady as a rock isn't the kind of guy who's gonna be slapdash with his salt and pepper.
Amber: Actually, that makes a lot of sense!
Bennett: I'm so sleepy after all that food... zzz...
Amber: Did Bennett fall asleep sitting up? He must be totally wiped out.
Traveler: It's been a tough few days.
Eula: The way he's sleeping is so... alert. I'm impressed.
Bennett: Zzz... zzz...
Paimon: He seems to be in a deep sleep. Paimon wonders if he sleep talks?
Bennett: Ugh... Ugh, no dad, no apples for me... I want Sticky Honey Roast and Fisherman's Toast...
Eula: Sticky Honey Roast... That's your favorite, isn't it, Amber?
Amber: Hmm, sure is! Give me a Sticky Honey Roast from Good Hunter any day!
Amber: I used to take Eula to Good Hunter a lot back when we first met. Before long, Sara would start cooking our usual orders as soon as she saw us coming.
Amber: She said we ordered the same things so often that it was practically muscle memory by that point! Haha.
Amber: She also said that if everyone in Mondstadt ordered like we do, her job would be so much easier. All she'd have to do is to memorize everyone's favorites...
Eula: Ahem!
Paimon: Always eating together... Aw, it's nice that you two are so close.
Paimon: #Traveler and Paimon always eat together, too. It's a sure sign of true friendship!
Eula: Two people simply sharing a meal says nothing either way about the relationship between them.
Albedo: That depends if it's a one-off meal or a regular occurrence.
Traveler: He's not wrong.
Paimon: Aha! Paimon just noticed something! Whenever Eula doesn't want to admit to something, she raises her chin or puts her hands on her hips.
Eula: ...Hmph.
Amber: Ah, you've all picked up on that. Didn't know Eula's tells were so easy to spot.
Eula: We are done here, yes? I am free to go, am I not?
Eula: Please excuse me. I have a frozen lake I need to be at.
Amber: You're going for an ice bath at this time of the night? W—Wait up, don't go without me!
Eula: I thought you wanted to get some sleep? So maybe you should stay here and rest.
Amber: No, I should come with you. It's late, and it's dark, and you're not good with directions like I am. Come on, let's go together.
Paimon: An ice bath...? Whew, rather them than Paimon.
Bennett: Zzz... so much... roast meat... zzz...
Bennett: Oh... hey dad... I'm doing alright... I'm the leader of my own adventure team now... Zzz...
Paimon: Wow, Bennett really is a sleep talker.
Paimon: Okay, looks like we got some downtime now!
Albedo: Alright you two, time to paint.
Traveler: Prepare to be amazed.
Albedo: Have you decided what to paint?
Paimon: Heh, like you even need to ask! It's obviously going to be Paimon.
Traveler: ...Okay. Paimon it is.
Albedo: Sure. But we should move elsewhere. We're likely to disturb Bennett's sleep if we stay here, so let's go outside.
Paimon: Okie-dokie! Alright, grab your easel, paper, brushes, and paints, don't leave anything behind!
Traveler: Time for me to show what I can do.

## Talk 4

Albedo: Let's paint here.
Paimon: Allow Paimon to adopt an elegant pose for your artistic reference!
Traveler: Huh?
Paimon: Hey! What's that look for? Cut the attitude and start putting your perfect Paimon down on the page! You'd better take this seriously, 'cause this is going on Paimon's wall!
Traveler: Alright then.
Albedo: Confidence is a good thing. Those to whom it is endowed do well to flaunt it. I'm looking forward to the finished piece.
Traveler: I'll humor Paimon.

## Talk 5

Albedo: Here we are. Make yourselves comfortable.
Albedo: Oh... I forgot, I don't have that many chairs. Please wait a moment.
Paimon: What's he doing? Painting?
Amber: He is!
Eula: He is painting a chair... Wait, alchemy can turn paintings into objects!? How is this possible?
Albedo: My paintings are like blueprints — alchemy simply enables me to omit the manufacturing part of the process. It's an elementary-level technique.
Albedo: With enough research and experimentation, this same technique can even be used to create living beings.
Bennett: Whoa... Well, since you can magically produce chairs, can I have one with a backrest?
Traveler: I'll have a stool.
Albedo: No problem. How many of you want backrests?
Bennett: Me!
Amber: Me! Me!
Eula: ...I'll also take one with a backrest, if you please.
Paimon: Can Paimon have a chair that comes with a juicer?
Traveler: A whole chair is way too big for you, surely?
Paimon: Still beats squeezing onto a stool with you! Hmph!
Bennett: Cool, we have chairs now! Haha, this is so comfortable! Makes me want to stay the night here!
Albedo: You're very welcome to stay overnight, if you wish.
Albedo: There's still some time before dinner. Get some rest, everyone. I'll tend the stove.
Amber: Hey now, we can't be letting you do all the work! I can help, please, put me to work!

## Talk 6

Paimon: #Alright. Let's start with the head! Now, Traveler, in your mind's eye, what is written on Paimon's face?
Traveler: "Paimon's all out of brain juice"...
Paimon: Huh? Is that how Paimon really looks to you? Huh...
Paimon: Okay forget it, we can come back to that. Let's move onto the body! C'mon! Paint what you see when you look at Paimon!
Traveler: Top-quality emergency food...
Paimon: Ugh... Paimon's starting to feel like this is not going to turn out so great... Now Paimon's getting nervous...
Traveler: Done.
Paimon: Lemme see, let Paimon see...
Paimon: Aah! What is this!?
Traveler: Not bad, right? I'm pretty happy with it.
Paimon: Why, you... how could... Huh. Paimon is lost for words! The brushwork is smooth and the composition seems professional-quality — you had no problems there, so what the heck happened with the face, huh!? Explain that stupid expression! Explain it!
Albedo: ...Smooth... Professional-quality...?
Paimon: And those eyes! Those boring, lifeless eyes! Where is the soul!!!
Albedo: Traveler, have you previously received any education in the fine arts?
Traveler: ...Very, very little...
Paimon: Oh, really? So it's just a hobby then? Well that sure explains a lot! There's no way you would have made Paimon look like this if you'd had any amount of formal training.
Traveler: I was just trying to convey how special you are.
Albedo: Fascinating.
Albedo: Paimon, if this is not to your liking, I can make a few amendments. Traveler, what do you think?
Traveler: Please. And thank you.
Albedo: ...
Albedo: Alright then.
Albedo: Paimon, is this better?
Paimon: It's... It's...
Paimon: It's a total ground-up overhaul, that's what it is! It's soooo pretty... is that really what Paimon looks like...?
Albedo: Adding flourish to the finished piece is an essential component of what makes art, art.
Albedo: This is not to say that you differ from the painting on a fundamental level. Rather, that the real you and the you in the painting present two different styles of beauty.
Albedo: You remain the core reference point for the painting. So, Paimon, you can put your misgivings aside and hang this painting wherever you like.
Traveler: Now I see the gap in our painting talents.
Paimon: Wow... Thanks, Albedo!
Albedo: I merely added a flourish here and there. You should be thanking the Traveler.
Albedo: (In truth, "ground-up overhaul" is more or less an accurate description.)
Paimon: The more Paimon looks at it, the more she likes it... Hehe, great! Paimon has a portrait painting!
Paimon: Paimon's gonna show this off to everyone!
Traveler: Paimon looks so happy. Thank you.
Albedo: It's nothing. I can paint you next time, if you'd like. You can hang it in your home as a souvenir.
Albedo: I rarely entertain so many guests at my camp. It's lively — a little noisy, even. But I don't dislike it.
Albedo: Liveliness is a rare thing here on Dragonspine.
Amber (???): Eula! EUUULAAA! Where are you!!!
Eula: Amber, we're here!
Amber: Eula! Oh, and Traveler, Paimon, Albedo, and Bennett, you're all together! Great!
Amber: Bennett, I'm glad I ran into you here. Cyrus was telling me you still hadn't shown up. He was getting worried you might've run into some trouble.
Bennett: Haha... Yeah, I ran into a little trouble... thanks for your concern.
Amber: Sure thing. Well, that now that I've found you, let's go check in with Cyrus.
Amber: But before that — has something come up? How come you're all gathered here together? Need any help?
Eula: Between us, there have been a few minor incidents. But nothing I haven't already dealt with.
Bennett: Oh! Uh, yeah, hehe, it's my fault really, all because of my bad luck. But everything is fine now!
Amber: So, it's all set then? Great. Shall we head back down together? I did say I'd bring Bennett back if I saw him.
Bennett: Sure, I'm ready to go!
Eula: ...Very well. Let's go.
Paimon: And then there were three.
Albedo: Traveler, can we talk somewhere else? There is something I need to tell you.
Traveler: Okay.
Albedo: Let's go to my camp.
Traveler: This was my trial by fire as an artist.
Traveler: No, but... art comes from the heart, so...
Paimon: What? You pour your heart on the page, and THIS is what comes out!?
Traveler: I just wanted to convey how special you are.
Paimon: "Special"? Huh... You seriously think "special" is supposed to look this ugly? Paimon's not convinced... but Paimon is struggling to come up with a come back.
Traveler: A top-tier flying pet...
Traveler: "Paimon's peeved"...
Traveler: Dopey but adorable...

## Talk 7

Amber: It's so nice and warm here...
Traveler: About Joel...
Amber: Joel's been doing pretty good. Having people to play with has put him in a good mood.
Amber: I'll tell you what though, he seems to have even more stamina than me!
Amber: So long as they're playing, kids always seem to have endless amounts of energy.
Traveler: About Dragonspine...
Amber: It's more dangerous up here than I thought.
Amber: In a hostile environment like this, even a knight of Favonius has to keep their eyes open and keep their wits about them at all times.
Amber: Still, this has been a pretty unique adventure for me. It's definitely been worth it.
Traveler: How are you holding up?
Amber: You know, when I was keeping Joel company, I started missing my grandfather really bad...
Amber: After he disappeared, I never saw him again. I have no idea how he's doing.
Amber: But at least what I can do is focus on being a great Outrider! If I can do that well, I know he'd be proud.
Traveler: About what happened today...
Amber: Oh, all that? Ah, don't worry about it.
Amber: Eula is a good person. She might not show it, but she'd never let that kind of stuff get to her.
Amber: As for Bennett, he seems like the kind of guy who can keep his spirits up when things aren't going well.
Amber: I feel bad for having to ask so much of Albedo, though...
Amber: Still, it's kinda nice to have everyone together like this, so... yay for silver linings.
Traveler: I'll leave you in peace.
Amber: Sure thing. Bet you're tired as well? You should get some rest, too.

## Talk 8

Bennett: I wonder if there's anything I can do to help out... ?
Traveler: About the rookie...
Bennett: Oh, you mean Gerald? I heard that Eula developed a whole training program for him.
Bennett: He might be new, but I bet he'll improve pretty quickly with a mentor like that.
Traveler: About Dragonspine...
Bennett: *sigh* I feel bad, it's hard knowing that I've been causing so much trouble for everyone.
Bennett: Being a little unlucky is usually no big deal for me. But in a place like this, it makes me worry that something really bad might come of it...
Bennett: No, wait, I shouldn't have said that. I might have actually jinxed it now.
Traveler: How are you holding up?
Bennett: Haha, you know me, same old Bennett... unlucky as ever.
Bennett: But as long as bad luck doesn't break me, I'll always get back up again.
Bennett: Especially on a cool adventure like this one. I gotta make the most of it!
Traveler: About what happened today...
Bennett: Hehe, sorry for dragging you guys into another situation.
Bennett: I didn't use to know any of these knights very well, but after spending some time with them on this trip, it's really opened my eyes to my own shortcomings.
Bennett: They're all so talented and kind. I have a lot to learn from them.
Bennett: Oh yeah — you gotta tell me sometime how you managed to make friends with so many talented people!
Traveler: I'll leave you in peace.
Bennett: Okay, cool. Make sure you eat plenty when dinner's ready.

## Talk 9

Eula: This is quite cozy... for Dragonspine, I'm pleasantly surprised.
Traveler: About the snowman...
Eula: I gave it a try, and I actually quite enjoyed it.
Eula: ...
Eula: But Amber said the snowman I made was too artistic... apparently, the conventional style is more rotund in appearance.
Eula: I couldn't tell if she was complimenting me or mocking me. Either way, I'm not about to let it go.
Traveler: About Dragonspine...
Eula: I'm quite familiar with Dragonspine by now.
Eula: But this time, I have a newcomer to worry about, and I am traveling in a group with Amber and the others. Not things I'm terribly well accustomed to.
Eula: Still, I've taken the job, so of course I'll do what's asked of me to the fullest of my ability. I'll settle this score once this is all over.
Traveler: How are you holding up?
Eula: Me? I'm coping perfectly well. I don't need looking after.
Eula: You should talk to Amber and Bennett. They're not as well acquainted with Dragonspine as I am.
Eula: Seeing how much you can find to talk about even with Albedo, you must be quite the conversationalist. So put that skill to good use — teach them all how to survive on Dragonspine. I'm sure this is well within your capability, no?
Traveler: About what happened today...
Eula: If you're talking about Bennett's situation, I think I'm used to it now. It's hardly the end of the world.
Eula: Don't ruminate on it. Take this chance to get some proper rest. The nights are long on Dragonspine.
Eula: ...
Eula: *sigh* A glass of ice-cold wine would not go amiss right now.
Traveler: I'll leave you in peace.
Eula: Don't mind me. Just do whatever you like.

## Talk 10

Albedo: Pace yourself, dinner could be a while... I still have a few things to prepare.

## Talk 11

Traveler: About the paint...
Albedo: I didn't expect you to be so interested in paint.
Albedo: I once tried grinding Mist Flowers into powder and mixing it with white paint to replicate the sparkle of snowflakes.
Albedo: The end result was quite satisfactory. But works that use this kind of paint need to be stored carefully.
Albedo: If you want to try it for yourself, I can help you.

## Talk 12

Traveler: About Dragonspine...
Albedo: Even now, I don't believe I have fully grasped the nature of the threat that Dragonspine poses.
Albedo: But I will endeavor to keep you safe. That much you can trust in.

## Talk 13

Traveler: How are you holding up?
Albedo: Hah. I wish I could simply respond with, "I'm fine."
Albedo: But you are a true friend to me, so I should be honest with you.
Albedo: Recently, certain questions have been occupying my mind... questions about the nature of life, and creation.
Albedo: However, I feel that rushing into a discussion with you on these topics before my ideas on them are fully formulated will bring you far more confusion than clarity.
Albedo: So I will wait till my thoughts are clear in my own head before I share them with you. Until then, please forgive me.

## Talk 14

Traveler: About what happened today...
Albedo: Don't worry about it. A chance like this to gather around the fire and chat into the night is a rare and precious one for me.
Albedo: I won't participate in the conversation much. It's just a habit of mine.
Albedo: But please know that I am enjoying the atmosphere all the same.
Albedo: Of course, I'm happy to continue chatting with you if you'd like.

## Talk 15

Traveler: When will dinner be?
Albedo: It's almost ready now. Traveler, please light the campfire and gather everyone for dinner.

## Talk 16

Traveler: I'll leave you in peace.
Albedo: This is my camp, but let's not get bogged down in technicalities. I want you to be able to relax and make yourself at home here.

## Talk 17

Bennett: Zzz... zzz...
Traveler: Observe Bennett.
Bennett (Observe Bennett.): Bennett is sleeping soundly with his eyes tightly shut...
Traveler: Listen to Bennett's sleep talking.
Bennett: Huh... Hey! Paimon, no, don't touch that!
Paimon: ...What the heck?
Bennett: Don't touch that mechanism! Or you'll... fall down... ugh, oh well, never mind...
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Ahhhh! What the heck is this guy dreaming about!
