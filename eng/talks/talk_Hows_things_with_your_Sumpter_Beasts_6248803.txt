Traveler: How's things with your Sumpter Beasts?
Wenhua: Well, very well! Chili and Yun have both put on quite some weight, and they're much stronger now.
Wenhua: Don't tell him this, but Tusheng's pretty good. His Sumpter Beast feed's quite popular with them both.
Wenhua: He's quite the hardworking one, too. Works from early till late preparing the feed, and he doesn't miss a beat.
Wenhua: He's different from those other Treasure Hoarders, I'll tell you that!
Wenhua: But seriously, why did he join them for, with a pair of hands as diligent as his... I suppose that's bad company for you...
Wenhua: In which case, I suppose that makes it my duty to steer him back onto the right path!
