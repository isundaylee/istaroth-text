Traveler: I'd love to meet Bluey.
Little Mao: No way! She's scared of strangers and doesn't usually wanna meet other people.
Little Mao: Hmm. Actually, why did she meet with me then? I'm not sure... It's just... When I was playing in the mountains one time, I saw a rabbit that couldn't move because of a rock that was on top of it. I removed that rock and gave it a fruit.
Little Mao: Although it didn't eat the fruit... it nodded at me before hopping into the forest.
Little Mao: It rained heavily after that on that day, and I couldn't find my way home, so I hid under a big rock.
Little Mao: Hehe... that's when Bluey came to me with lots of fruits. She told me to eat my fill and then guided me out of the mountains.
Little Mao: But my parents didn't believe what I told them after I got home. They just told me to never enter the mountains by myself again.
