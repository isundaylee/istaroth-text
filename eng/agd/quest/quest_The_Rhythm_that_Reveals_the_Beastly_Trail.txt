# The Rhythm that Reveals the Beastly Trail


## Talk 1

Aradasa: ♪~

## Talk 2

Paimon: We now have the second Vasoma Fruit!
Arama: #Impressive! Nara Traveler is not afraid of Marana and even drove all the monsters away. No wonder you could defeat Vanagni!
Paimon: Hehe, the many adventures we've been through aren't just for show, y'know?
Arama: #That's great! Then Nara Traveler and Paimon must have many memories and stories, right?
Traveler: We do have a great many, yes.
Arama: #I see. If you don't mind, we'd love to hear Nara Traveler and Paimon's stories sometime.
Paimon: Sure! We've shared our stories with others before, though it feels like so long ago...
Paimon: Speaking of which, Paimon saw a giant purple tree in the distance while we were in the Vasara Tree's dream. Paimon's pretty sure we saw it in Vanarana, too. What was that?
Arama: That's the very first Ashvattha's Tree of Dreams. Hmm, how should I put this...
Arama: Dreams are like leaves in a stream. They soon float away with the water. If you want to keep a dream in place, you have to let it grow roots. That way, the dream won't drift away.
Arama: Hmm... it's so hard to explain...
Traveler: So Ashvattha's Tree of Dreams is like their "roots"?
Arama: #Nara Traveler is smart. This tree keeps Aranara's dreams stable. Aranara can enter or exit dreams and are able to connect with the Vasara Tree.
Paimon: So that's how it is. Do you mean, then, that the Vanarana in dreams can be maintained because of that tree?
Arama: Yes. But I'm very concerned about Marana right now. We'll have to come up with a plan later.
Arama: ...
Arama: #But let's get the Bija first! We need to help the friend of Nara Traveler, Paimon, and Arana!
Paimon: Yeah! Will you be looking for other Ashvattha's Concourses after this, Arama?
Arama: Yes! So we'll see each other again for sure!
Paimon: Stay safe, Arama!
Arama: #You too, Nara Traveler and Paimon!
Traveler: So Ashvattha's Tree of Dreams keeps dreams from drifting away?
Traveler: Eh, we do have some.

## Talk 3

Arama: #Greetings, Nara Traveler, Paimon!
Paimon: It's good to see you again, Arama! Who's the Aranara with you...?
Aradasa (???): ♪~
Arama: Oh, Aradasa is a "song gatherer" who collects songs of all kinds. He doesn't like talking. He believes singing is way better.
Paimon: Hmm... Eh, you do have a point. So, is this one of Ashvattha's Concourses?
Paimon: There aren't any trees here, but there sure are roses... floating in mid-air?
Arama: No, it is not. But it is a great discovery nonetheless. Here lies a song that we Aranara have been unable to find for many, many years.
Arama: Aranara song gatherers always pursue the beauty of songs. At the end of time, they will leave behind a song that belongs only to themselves.
Traveler: Does this have anything to do with Ashvattha's Concourses?
Arama: Yes! This over here seems to be the song left behind by Arayama. If that's the case, there should be a Vasara Tree nearby.
Paimon: Paimon remembers Araja saying something about the Vasara Trees... Let Paimon check the Aranyaka real quick...
Paimon: #Vasara Trees bear Vasoma Fruits! We should help them, Traveler!
Arama: Thank you! The song is hidden among the roses. But Arayasa and I have looked for hours and hours, and we couldn't find it. The roses won't talk to us either.
Paimon: #Paimon sees. Traveler, let's try having a look, too!
Traveler: Since it's for Rana...
Paimon: Yup! And anyway, finding stuff is what we do best!
Traveler: Okay.
Traveler: Best of luck to you.
Arama: #Thank you, Nara Traveler! This seems to be the song left by Arayama. If that's the case, there should be a Vasara Tree nearby. We've lucked out!

## Talk 4

Arama: #Greetings, Nara Traveler, Paimon!
Paimon: Hey there, Arama. Good to see you again! Who's the Aranara with you?
Aradasa (???): ♪~
Arama: Oh, Aradasa is also a "song gatherer." He doesn't like talking. He believes singing is way better.
Paimon: Hmm... Eh, you do have a point. Anyway, is there a song hidden here too?
Arama: Yes! Aradasa said Arayama's song has been left here. If that's the case, there should be a Vasara Tree nearby.
Paimon: #And where there's a Vasara Tree, there should be a Vasoma Fruit! Let's help them out, Traveler!
Arama: #Thank you! It's just as before — the song is hidden amongst the roses. Nara Traveler and Paimon are smart. I'm sure you can find it right away!
Traveler: Since it's for Rana...
Paimon: Yep! Leave it to us!
Traveler: Okay.

## Talk 5

Aradasa: ...
Arama: This is the song Arayama left behind...
Aradasa: "Press forward and sing, even if the path is filled with flame..."
Aradasa: "Even if the pale moonlight on that night resembles the eyes of a dying beast..."
Arama: "For we are the children of the Valley of Life — for we are the seeds of courage."
Paimon: So this is the song we found...?
Aradasa: "For the pomegranates that wish to bear fruits, for the roses that yearn to blossom."
Aradasa: "A distant sky yet so close at hand... A promise ever unbroken... A city that returns to you in your dreams..."
Arama: I see, I see it now! We can clear out the obstacles along the way to Ashvattha's Concourse using Arayama's song.
Traveler: That makes sense to me too.
Paimon: Wait a minute. What makes sense again?
Arama: Through Arayama's song, of course. Hmm... Is this something that might be hard to grasp if you are not an Aranara?
Arama: Anyway, Aradasa, how about you go back to prepare for Festival Utsava? Leave Ashvattha's Concourse to me!
Aradasa: ♪~
Paimon: We'll come with you! After all, we promised to help you get those Vasoma Fruits!
Aradasa: "...Press forward and sing."
Traveler: How did you "see it"?

## Talk 6

Traveler: I need a minute...
Arama: Alright. I'll wait for you.

## Talk 7

Arama: I wonder. What sort of song did Arayama leave behind?

## Talk 8

Paimon: Is this... the Vasara Tree? Doesn't seem as lively as Paimon imagined...
Arama: It must've been corroded by Marana... I'm so sorry, Arayama. We never realized that Marana's corruption had even reached here.
Arama: When I was a teeny tiny seed, I heard stories about Aramuhukunda, Arayama, and Araji.
Arama: Arayama didn't really like Nara, so he created the phantasmal barrier. He was happy to see the Nara's frustrated faces. But there was one Nara who saw through his Ararakalari.
Arama: No matter how hard he tried, that Nara always found a way to break through. Then they slowly became friends.
Paimon: Well, that's how some friendships form... What happened to Arayama in the end?
Arama: At the end of the story, a great catastrophe occurred. He protected a lot of Aranara and Nara.
Arama: Ah! No wonder his song could disperse all those illusions. It's because their game has ended.
Traveler: How can we get the Vasoma Fruit?
Arama: First, we must enter his dream to destroy Marana's lingering influence.
Paimon: Wait a second... When you say "his dream," you mean that of the Vasara Tree?
Arama: That's right. If you are ready, reach out your hand and enter his dream...

## Talk 9

Traveler: (Reach your hand out to the Vasara Tree...)

## Talk 10

Paimon: So this is...
Arama: Yes. This is a Vasoma Fruit.
Arama: It is the accumulation of the dreams and memories gathered by the Vasara Tree. It's a precious fruit that can help us restore our strength.
Arama: A large amount of energy must be consumed for the Ashvattha Tree to produce a Bija. That is why we must offer Vasoma Fruits.
Arama: #Keep the Vasoma Fruit safe, Nara Traveler!
Paimon: Hmm. You know what? Let's teach Arama the meaning of "treasure"!
Paimon: Now then! "Treasure" refers to something very precious. This Vasoma Fruit contains lots of dreams and memories, and it can restore an Aranara's power. That makes it pretty rare and amazing, right?
Paimon: For things like Vasoma Fruits that are rare and precious, we call them "treasure"!
Arama: Ah, so this is what treasure means... I got it! Thank you, Paimon!
Traveler: So, what's next?
Paimon: Hmm... Araja said that we'll need more than one Vasoma Fruit. That means we need to find other Ashvattha's Concourses, right?
Arama: #That's right. I'll do my best to find them! So long, Nara Traveler and Paimon!
Paimon: See you later, Arama!
Traveler: Thanks, Paimon!
Paimon: What are you thanking Paimon for...? Anyway, Araja said that we'll need more than one Vasoma Fruit. That means we need to find other Ashvattha's Concourses, right?

## Talk 11

Paimon: Paimon didn't expect Marana's corruption to be here too...
Arama: #Nara Traveler is amazing. You drove Marana away easily this time, too.
Arama: I'm so sorry, Arayama. We never realized that Marana's corruption had even reached here.
Arama: When I was a teeny tiny seed, I heard stories about Aramuhukunda, Arayama, and Araji.
Arama: Arayama didn't really like Nara, so he created the phantasmal barrier. He was happy to see the Nara's frustrated faces. But there was one Nara who saw through his Ararakalari.
Arama: No matter how hard he tried, that Nara always found a way to break through. Then they slowly became friends.
Paimon: Well, that's how some friendships form... What happened to Arayama in the end?
Arama: At the end of the story, a great catastrophe occurred. He protected a lot of Aranara and Nara.
Arama: Ah! No wonder his song could disperse all those illusions. It's because their game has ended.
Traveler: Do we need to enter the dream of the Vasara Tree this time too?
Arama: Yes. We must erase all traces of Marana's influence.
Arama: That's right. If you are ready, reach out your hand and enter his dream...

## Talk 12

Paimon: Next up, our third Vasoma Fruit!
Traveler: Let's do this for the Bija...
Arama: I'm so sorry, Arayama. We never realized that Marana's corruption had even reached here.
Arama: When I was a teeny tiny seed, I heard stories about Aramuhukunda, Arayama, and Araji.
Arama: Arayama didn't really like Nara, so he created the phantasmal barrier. He was happy to see the Nara's frustrated faces. But there was one Nara who saw through his Ararakalari.
Arama: No matter how hard he tried, that Nara always found a way to break through. Then they slowly became friends.

Arama: At the end of the story, a great catastrophe occurred. He protected a lot of Aranara and Nara.
Arama: Ah! No wonder his song could disperse all those illusions. It's because their game has ended.
Traveler: Let's go.
Arama: If you are ready, reach out your hand and enter his dream...
Traveler: Let's do this for Rana...

## Talk 13

Arama: #Nara Traveler, if you are ready, reach out your hand and enter his dream...

### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: We got the third Vasoma Fruit! According to Araja, three Vasoma Fruits should be enough, right?
Arama: #Yes, that will do. Thank you, Nara Traveler and Paimon!
Traveler: You're welcome.
Paimon: Still, you were the one helping us throughout, Arama. So why are you thanking us?
Arama: Well... It's because you are helping Arana, and Arana is my friend. So, thank you.
Arama: #And Nara Traveler has helped Arayasa, Aradasa, and Arasudraka find the ancient songs. They're my friends too. Thank you for that, too.
Arama: #Finally, I'm so happy that I got to go on adventures with Nara Traveler and Paimon. So, thanks for that as well.
Paimon: Paimon had a good time too! Thank you, Arama!
Paimon: Speaking of which, Ashvattha's Concourses looked a lot like ancient ruins... Is there a story behind that?
Arama: That's a story from long, long ago. I wasn't even a seed then. It was a time when all Nara could see Aranara and not a single Aranara was afraid of Nara.
Arama: #Back then, Nara and Aranara helped each other. They played and sang together, just like Nara Traveler and I.
Arama: Song gatherers like Arayasa originally learned their craft from Nara.
Arama: Ashvattha's Concourses used to be where Nara and Aranara played together. But that was a long time ago.
Arama: After the horrible, horrible catastrophe occurred, Vanarana was devastated, and the concourses were left desolate...
Paimon: So that's what happened...
Arama: Yes, and it's a very scary tale indeed. I'm lucky that they are not memories to me — only stories.
Paimon: #Don't worry! Things will get better. Right, Traveler?
Traveler: That's right.
Arama: We've found Ashvattha's Concourses and obtained three Vasoma Fruits. Next, I've got to help prepare for Festival Utsava and call some of my friends back from the forest.
Paimon: Best of luck, Arama! Paimon's super looking forward to the festival!
Arama: Me too! I'll see you guys soon!
Paimon: Bye, Arama!
Traveler: I wouldn't be too sure...
Paimon: #...Are you tired, Traveler?
Traveler: You've been the one helping us...
