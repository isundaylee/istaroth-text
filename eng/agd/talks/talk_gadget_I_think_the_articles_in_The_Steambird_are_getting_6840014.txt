Message: "I think the articles in The Steambird are getting more boring by the day. It's all just reprinting the same hackneyed tripe that everyone already knows."
Message: "Other than Charlotte, their reporters are just fixated on superficial drivel. Sometimes their new content is nothing but hearsay, without even an iota of truth to it!"
Another Person's Message: "Why not give La Gouttiere a read? They've got a new editor, and the content is getting more and more riveting. It's far more interesting than some of the supposedly more truthful papers."
