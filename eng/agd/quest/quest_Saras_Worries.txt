# Sara's Worries


## Talk 1

Amber: Got it. I'll set off right away!
Paimon: Amber! Are you here to help out with Jean's commission?
Amber: Oh, hi. Yeah, I was just getting ready. Who better than an Outrider to mop up some hilichurls on the delivery route?
Sara: *sigh* ...
Amber: Sara... What are you still stressing about? I'm an Outrider, and I won't disappoint!
Sara: You misunderstand me. I don't doubt your abilities, I'm just overwhelmed at the number of orders piling up in front of me.
Sara: Another bizarre order came in just now. It's like they're hosting a banquet or something...
Amber: *clears throat*...
Traveler: Is there anything we can help with?
Traveler: I can help with the cooking!
Sara: Really! You don't mind helping?
Sara: That would be wonderful! You really are the Good Hunter's guardian angel.
Amber: Yeah well... Those hilichurls are going to be a handful, too.
Sara: Well, why don't you take this order. Start by getting the ingredients.
Paimon: #Are you sure Traveler can be trusted? It might end up tasting a bit funky...
Sara: We're well past the point of aiming for perfection. This is now a fight to save the Good Hunter's business.
Paimon: A fight?
Sara: For this dish, we need... *three Sweet Flowers and three Fowls*.
Sara: Okay, go and get ready. You too, Amber. I'll be waiting here.
Amber: O—Okay...

## Talk 2

Sara: You're back — have you brought the ingredients? Let me see...
Sara: ...Yep. That's everything.
Sara: Now — order number seven is for one *Sweet Madame*.
Paimon: And so begins the story of us becoming basic kitchen hands!
Sara: You did say you'd help Good Hunter out — be sure to serve it while it's hot.

## Talk 3

Sara: One *Sticky Honey Roast*, please. I thought I taught you the recipe already?

## Talk 4

Sara: One Sweet Madame, received!
Sara: Mmm, it smells... pretty good! You have a knack for this — just the person I need!
Sara: Hmm, since you cook so well... You might as well take this *Sticky Honey Roast* next.
Paimon: *Sticky Honey Roast*! We tried that before, with Amber!
Sara: That's right, a mainstay of the Good Hunter menu. It's my pride and joy!
Sara: The Knights order it almost every time they come here for a gathering.
Sara: Let me teach you the recipe for a *Sticky Honey Roast*...
Paimon: Wait, didn't you say it's your pride and joy? You're going to teach us how to make it, just like that?
Sara: With your cooking skills, I don't think you will be doing a disservice to the Good Hunter brand! Hee-hee.
Sara: As soon as that *Sticky Honey Roast* is ready, please bring it here.

## Talk 5

Sara: Have you brought me *three Sweet Flowers and three Fowls*? Let me see...

Sara: Can I get food to-go?

## Talk 7

Sara: Is it ready? Let me see, let me seeee!
Sara: This is a very good effort. I think you really captured the essence of what the dish is all about.
Paimon: Are we released from kitchen duty now?
Sara: Yes, thanks ever so much for your help. Amber should be able to take care of everything else.
Sara: If you ever get tired of being an adventurer, there'll be a job waiting for you at Good Hunter if you want it!

## Talk 8

Sara: Is it ready? Let me see, let me seeee!
Sara: This is... Wow. Did you really cook this? This is quite simply astonishing. You were born to be a head chef!
Paimon: Are we released from kitchen duty now?
Sara: Yes, thanks ever so much for your help. Amber should be able to take care of everything else.
Sara: If you ever get tired of being an adventurer, there'll be a job waiting for you at Good Hunter if you want it!

## Talk 9

Sara: One Sweet Madame, received!
Sara: Mmm! That smells absolutely divine! This is nothing less than what I would expect from a head chef, never mind a sous-chef...
Sara: Hmm, since you cook so well... You might as well take this *Sticky Honey Roast* next.
Paimon: *Sticky Honey Roast*! We tried that before, with Amber!
Sara: That's right, a mainstay of the Good Hunter menu. It's my pride and joy!
