# Denial and Judgment

An earring that you picked up in the ruins after completing the duel against The Knave.
The red symbol upon it resembles the image in her eyes, a declaration and a rejection alike.
The orphaned live lives filled with suffering from childhood â€” this she sees and keeps in her heart.
As fate casts an examining eye on humanity, so too will humans cast judgment upon fate.
