Traveler: How about "The Vanishing Fox"?
Saimon Eri: Mm... Legend has it that there was once a white fox who called herself "Saiguu," and who served the Electro Archon. It is said that she would occasionally appear in the form of a human to listen to people's wishes.
Saimon Eri: However, all wishes require some sort of recompense. They say that your wish would be granted if you offered fried tofu to Saiguu.
Saimon Eri: Legend has it that she once tasked the ancestors of Konda Village with a mysterious mission. In return, she would protect and ensure the eternal peace and prosperity of the village.
Saimon Eri: However, for some unknown reason, Saiguu stopped responding to people's wishes. As such, fewer people made offerings to her. Eventually, the mysterious mission was also forgotten.
Saimon Eri: Afterwards, villagers gradually began encountering some kind of "spirit" around the village.
Saimon Eri: People who have seen this "spirit" have described it as something that takes the form of a young woman who appears on thundering, rainy nights. Sometimes, she seems near â€” and other times, far away...
Saimon Eri: Some say this must be because the offerings have become lacking. Others say that it's because the people of Konda Village have forgotten their mission. Either way, the great fox now manifests angrily in the form of a ghost as a warning.
Saimon Eri: Some even say that she is no longer the white fox who brings prosperity, and that instead, she's become a resentful Tatarigami...
Saimon Eri: Once a Tatarigami sets its eyes on you, it will continue to stalk you in dark corners that you cannot see...
