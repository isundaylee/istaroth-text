## Talk 7

Taliesin: This might seem a little sudden, good hero, but could you spare a moment to tell me a story or two of yours for me to turn into songs for those who come after?

Taliesin: I would be most grateful if you were to agree! Well then, fire away! I'm listening.
Traveler: I've got a ton of stories to tell.

Traveler: Tell of the darkness and the creatures from the Abyss...
Black Screen Text: You tell Taliesin of the things that happened...
Taliesin: My, oh my. This is great. This is perfect! Give me a moment, let me write it all down.
Taliesin: "The dark fog pressed in like an avalanche, and the two apostles of the Abyss, now separated, disappeared without a trace, just as they had appeared..."
