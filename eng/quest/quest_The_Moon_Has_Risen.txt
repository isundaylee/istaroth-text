# The Moon Has Risen


## Talk 1

Kujirai Momiji: "Lunar Leviathan"...
Traveler: What "Lunar Leviathan"?
Kujirai Momiji: Oh, hey there! You must be the fisherman sent by the Adventurers' Guild, huh? I'm Kujirai Momiji, an Inazuman fisherwoman.
Kujirai Momiji: I heard about you from the Fishing Association. Seeing you today, you are indeed as young and promising as they said. I hope I didn't get the wrong person.
Kujirai Momiji: Recently I have been searching for a fish that is from legends. It's called the "Lunar Leviathan". According to the legends, it has the power to grant people's wishes.
Paimon: Wowee — a wish-granting fish! Paimon likes these kinds of legends!
Kujirai Momiji: Hmph, even though everyone believes they are just legends...I believe it's real.
Kujirai Momiji: Because a few years ago, I may have personally encountered a "Lunar Leviathan"...
Traveler: Did it grant your wish?
Kujirai Momiji: Well... kind of. The story goes like this...
Kujirai Momiji: A couple of years ago, because of each of our respective wishes, two friends and myself set out to sea to pursue the "Lunar Leviathan". One was Jiawei and the other was Nantuck.
Kujirai Momiji: But the journey was turbulent. We encountered a violent thunderstorm. And although our fishing boat survived, our compass got damaged and we were lost in an unknown patch of ocean.
Kujirai Momiji: A few days later, we still could not find the way home. We were out of fresh water and though no one said anything, everyone was getting desperate.
Kujirai Momiji: To the point where one night, Jiawei wrote a suicide note, put it in a bottle and was about to throw it out to sea.
Kujirai Momiji: He didn't know but we weren't asleep at the time. We heard him sneaking out and we rushed to grabbed him. And in that moment we all saw a giant shape under the water.
Kujirai Momiji: The shape glowed faintly, shining little by little, as if pieces of the moon were dropped underwater.
Kujirai Momiji: Was it a "Lunar Leviathan"? We were desperate so we believed so, we asked it to grant us safe return to our homeland.
Kujirai Momiji: Yep, whether you can believe it or not, we survived. When the magical shape began swimming away, we followed it and it led us back home.
Paimon: Aww...That's such a touching legend!
Kujirai Momiji: No! It's true! Believe me! We can definitely find it again.
Traveler: What should we do?
Kujirai Momiji: Well let's go find my old pals first. They're both seasoned fishermen and having them accompany us would help a great deal.
Kujirai Momiji: *Jiawei is located at Liyue Harbor,* I heard once he returned to Liyue he never left again. I'm sure he still reminisces about the "Lunar Leviathan" as well.
Kujirai Momiji: As for Nantuck, I heard he started writing books about marine biology. When you meet Jiawei, you can ask him where he is.

## Talk 2

Jiawei: The ocean is like a beautiful woman, only a welcoming sight every so often...
Traveler: Are you Jiawei?
Jiawei: Yes, what do you want?
Jiawei: Oh — the "Lunar Leviathan"! Of course it's about the "Lunar Leviathan"! That experience really stays with you.
Jiawei: As for Kujirai, she also did not forget. Her wish was... Uh... Um, uhh...
Jiawei: Then I will send you off with my best wishes, I hope you guys succeed!
Paimon: Huh? We came here to invite you, don't you want to come with us?
Jiawei: Ah! I nearly lost my life at that time. The ocean is like a beautiful woman, only a welcoming sight every so often...
Jiawei: Additionally, as a married man, how could I abandon my family? I must take on the role of being head of the household!
Jiawei: After all the hard work and sweat I put in to marry such a generous and wonderful woman! So, I must apologize...
Traveler: Your old pal will be disappointed.
Jiawei: Don't talk like that...let me think...
Jiawei: Although I cannot accompany you on your journey, I will help in another way. I will pass on my years of fishing experience and knowledge to you.
Jiawei: A legendary creature like the "Lunar Leviathan" will not be caught easily.
Jiawei: So, accept my training, inherit my knowledge and then go pursue the legendary fish!
Jiawei: Oh, right? Aren't you guys in a hurry to find Nantuck? Don't worry, that guy's been hibernating like an old sea turtle. He's stayed in Mondstadt all this time, it's said that he's writing a book?
Jiawei: Now focus! Jiawei's magical fishing training is about to begin! Once training is over, you can go look for him.
