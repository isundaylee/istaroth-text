# The Omnipresent God


## Talk 1

Raiden Shogun (Ei): Indulge my curiosity. What is the reason that I find you standing here before me once again?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Do you hope your foolhardiness will shelter those people? Or... was it simply a means of seeking an audience with me?
Traveler: The Fatui have deceived the Raiden Shogun.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Oh? Surely you didn't rouse me from my state of eternal meditation only to tell me this?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): If so, then you underestimate me. I am quite well-informed about the Vision Hunt Decree.
Traveler: You know everything that's going on outside?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Not so. Only everything that pertains to eternity.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): The Vision Hunt Decree has my tacit approval.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): The Fatui's actions thus far do not constitute a threat to eternity, otherwise... they would have been purged long ago.
Traveler: But the Vision Hunt Decree is damaging.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Individual ambition is inherently incompatible with eternity.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): What you might not realize is that all too often... people have far more to lose by chasing their dreams.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Consider this â€” no one will lose their life on account of having their Vision taken away...
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Rather, those who have lost their lives are the ones who insisted on pursuing their own aspirations, are they not?
Traveler: Teppei...
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Traveler, your existence is unique in my eyes.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): There seems to be limitless uncertainty in you. To put it another way, you are the furthest thing from eternity.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): So I won't insist that you comprehend the meaning of my actions. What matters is that I tread the path of eternity on my people's behalf.
Traveler: This is your Plane of Euthymia...
Traveler: It is created by your consciousness, yes?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): That's right. I'm surprised you understand it so well...
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Anyway. You're looking for a chance to shake my will... aren't you?
Traveler: I'm not here to debate your ideas.
Traveler: I'm here to demolish them.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): ...
Raiden Shogun (Ei): So be it. Well then, you who would defy eternity... Time for you to enlighten me.
Traveler: It comes at a great cost to the people of Inazuma.
Traveler: The Vision Hunt Decree should never have existed.

## Talk 2

Yae Miko: You've lost, Ei.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): ...
Raiden Shogun (Ei): ...Yes, I have.
Yae Miko: Why can you not trust your people, and in the power of their ambitions?
Yae Miko: These ambitions have transcended space and time. They are something that no one can snuff out.
Traveler: When people move forward with all their might...
Yae Miko: Is this the lesson you learned from your journey in Liyue?
Traveler: Yes.
Yae Miko: There are nations where humans cast their god aside and stride forward...?
Yae Miko: So, are we to just abandon the notion of progress... for the sake of wishful thinking?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): ...You and I have both witnessed the great loss that progress can bring.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Eternity... eternity is the only way...
Yae Miko: The Heavenly Principles... Irrelevant nonsense as far as I am concerned.
Yae Miko: When all's said and done, all you really want is to protect your beloved Inazuma, forever and ever. Isn't that right?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): That would be something of an oversimplification.
Yae Miko: But is this nation worth existing for eternity?
Yae Miko: Stripped of ambitions, stripped of the potential for change, it does nothing more than simply... exist. It is a hollow shell of a nation.
Yae Miko: Huh. I wonder what loss would it really be to anyone if such a nation were destroyed?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Miko, retract your words.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Never-changing eternity is the promise I made to my people.
Yae Miko: But what your people need from you is not your promises. They want your attention... your divine gaze.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): ...You mean Visions?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Humans have a lifespan of barely a hundred years. They cannot afford to bear any extra losses.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): But I have experienced it all. That is why I have chosen to guide them along the correct path toward eternity.
Yae Miko: *sigh*...
Yae Miko: But eternity is far too cruel a fate for you, Ei.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): For me?
Yae Miko: Not only have you stopped paying attention to the world, but you have stopped paying attention to yourself.
Yae Miko: It must have been terribly lonely here, all alone, for centuries on end.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): But it is necessary...
Yae Miko: You will miss much by refusing progress... You seek to prevent loss, but have you considered all you are losing by remaining here in stasis for all eternity?
Yae Miko: You are obviously lonely, and yet for the sake of eternity you choose to stretch your loneliness out to infinity...
Yae Miko: Tell me this. Why is the sky here that was once so dark glowing again? Why now?
Yae Miko: This is your Plane of Euthymia. It's your inner world.
Yae Miko: So it can only mean... that you are happy to see me again. You have found the loneliness here unbearable for a long time now, haven't you?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): I... have nothing to say to that.
Yae Miko: Hehehe, oh, but I have so much to say to you. Let me tell you all that has happened over the last few centuries.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): How long will that take?
Yae Miko: As a fox envoy, I have an excellent memory. I recall every detail of the last few centuries with perfect clarity.
Yae Miko: So it will probably take me another few centuries to relay it to you.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Heh... hehe... Miko, I never thought I would have the chance to meet with you like this again.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): *sigh* Seeing you again is a change to eternity... and a very nice surprise.
Yae Miko: Hehe, since you are willing to admit that, I suppose that means we can still be friends?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): What a childish conversation this is.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Anyway. Now that I have been defeated by you and your plan, I will honor your wish to abolish the Vision Hunt Decree.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): But with regards to eternity and the question of whether this nation should move forward, I need time to give it some thought.
Yae Miko: Hehe, you are the one who's been acting like a child from the very beginning.
Traveler: They can surpass the gods' expectations.
Traveler: And even take over the work of the gods.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Paimon: So what did you guys do in the Raiden Shogun's Plane of Euthymia anyway?
Paimon: Is the Vision Hunt Decree abolished?
Traveler: It was all thanks to Yae Miko.
Paimon: Oh, gotcha... Paimon was super worried, y'know.
Paimon: So maybe the reason Yae Miko is looking for us now is 'cause she wants to thank us? Let's go find her.
Traveler: We conveyed the wishes of the people.
