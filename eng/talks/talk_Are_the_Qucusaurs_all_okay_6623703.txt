Traveler: Are the Qucusaurs all okay?
Mukki: Thank you for your concern. They can sometimes be stauncher than humans.
Mukki: Qucusaurs are very proud Saurians, so they never forget any decisions that they've made.
Mukki: So long as it can still spread its wings and fly, a Qucusaurus will never abandon a human companion it has recognized.
Mukki: The Flower-Feather Clan has survived to this day by relying on such human-Saurian cooperation. That's something that will never change even in the future.
