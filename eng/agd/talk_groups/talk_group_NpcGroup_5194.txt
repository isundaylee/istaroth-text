## Talk

"Tilla": This wine is quite lovely. Would you like some? My treat.

## Talk

Traveler: You are...
"Tilla": Oh, excuse me. Let me introduce myself.
"Tilla": I'm Tilla, a humble messenger.
"Tilla": It's a pleasure to meet you. You seem as trustworthy as you've been made out to be.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
"Tilla": Good day to you. I believe we'll meet again soon.

## Talk

Traveler: Do you know me?
"Tilla": How could I not have heard of you? Your deeds are quite renowned in these parts.
"Tilla": Several of my colleagues are preparing to extend an invitation to you for a friendly meeting and are looking forward to reaching some, shall we say, mutually beneficial arrangements with you.

## Talk

Traveler: What does a "messenger" do?
"Tilla": Never mind, don't worry about it! This is just a humdrum job that helps people take a load off their minds.
"Tilla": If someone needs help, we help them find it. If someone needs to convey a message, we help them with that too.
"Tilla": This job's no different from being a fisherman, a chef, a sailor, or a porter.
"Tilla": I'd even venture to say that in some ways, being a "messenger" is far more... beneficial to the public good. Hehe.

## Talk

Traveler: What kind of arrangements?
"Tilla": Ho! What else could our business be? Making Mora! Getting some perks! And lining our pockets! In any case, one shouldn't waste their life doing nothing.
"Tilla": Hehe, if you're interested, I'd be honored. Once I've drafted up an agreement, I'll pick a suitable time to visit you.
"Tilla": I think this may be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

## Talk

Traveler: I don't think there'll be any chances for us to collaborate.
"Tilla": Don't say that. Who knows what will happen in the future? Please take this as a small token of my appreciation.
"Tilla": Have a nice day today, and tomorrow as well! Hehe...
