# Talk Dialog

Junkichi: Ugh, this deadline... There's no way I'll make it.
Junkichi: How about I just do a short story in a parallel universe, just to get something in for the festival, and then we can talk?
Shigeru: What? A parallel universe? Will the characters still be the same ones?
Junkichi: Well yes... and not entirely, no...
Junkichi: I mean, if we create a new world setting, then we don't have to consider the original narrative. We'll be free to innovate! This'll be done in no time!
Shigeru: ...Please don't do this. That's no different from the author writing fan fiction for himself!
Shigeru: Adding features and plot devices on for this reason will ruin all the content that we've built up so far. It's not worth it!
Junkichi: Come on, can't we...? Then I guess we've just got to prepare for the eventuality that I won't finish the manuscript.
