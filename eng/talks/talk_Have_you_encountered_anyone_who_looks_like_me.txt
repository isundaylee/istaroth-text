Traveler: Have you encountered anyone who looks like me?
Ylgr: Looking for someone? ...I'm sorry, I don't think your appearance rings a bell.
Ylgr: I've been checking maps of Mondstadt for discrepancies lately, so I've only had eyes for the mountains and the rivers.
Ylgr: A person needs to give their tasks their full attention, wouldn't you say?
