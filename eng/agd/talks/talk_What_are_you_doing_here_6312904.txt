Traveler: What are you doing here?
Tejima: Do you mean... before? Or now?
Tejima: I helped out the villagers here and drove away Treasure Hoarders who were causing disturbances. Just little things that were within my power â€” nothing worth mentioning.
Tejima: But I can still vaguely remember that I was waiting here in this village for something important...
Tejima: It's just that I've almost completely forgotten what that was, so I have no idea why I stayed here...
Tejima: *sigh* Oh well... There's no reason to stay if I can't remember the reason for it. I might as well leave and go look around.
Tejima: How about you? You look to be an outlander. What brings you to Inazuma with the Sakoku Decree still in effect?
