Traveler: How do you like it here?
Beidou: Yeah, pretty good! Feels nice to sit and relax in such a scenic place!
Beidou: But...
Traveler: But what?
Beidou: But you know that I'll be craving the billowing waves of the open ocean before too long! It's where I belong.
Beidou: The churning ocean waves are the best lullaby.
Beidou: Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm thrilled that you invited me here.
Beidou: I'll have to return the favor sometime by hosting you onboard the ship!
Traveler: But you miss the sea already?
Beidou: Haha! You get me!
Beidou: Days spent sailing through a storm, conquering the surging waters... yeah, those are happy days!
