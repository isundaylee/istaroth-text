# Talk Dialog

Traveler: What are you talking about?
Arapandu: #Ah, it's Nara {NICKNAME}.
Arapandu: #Nara {NICKNAME} healed Varuna Contraption, so the trees and seeds are lively again.
Arapandu: #That's why we are naming Varuna Contraption as {NICKNAME} Contraption, to show our thanks.
Arapandu: But that would break Nara Varuna's heart, if Nara Varuna comes back.
Arapandu: #So Arapandu is trying to make Nara {NICKNAME} and Nara Varuna happy together.
