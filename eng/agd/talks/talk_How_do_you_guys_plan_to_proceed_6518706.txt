Traveler: How do you guys plan to proceed?
Mermet: I heard that Ms. Cassigneul is planning on conducting another comprehensive hydrological survey.
Mermet: While that's a good thing, hydrological surveys don't happen overnight. We have no idea when it'll be completed, but we can't afford to suspend the harbor's operations in the meantime.
Mermet: So until then, we'll just have to rely on our experience and intuition.
