Roca: Now that was a great warm-up! Most praiseworthy.
Humboldt: ...But...?
Roca: But I still have a problem with the muscle groups that are used for rock climbing.

Roca: You can't only use your arms just because your legs are a bit uncoordinated. How can you put extra pressure on something that was already lacking in the first place?
Roca: We're going to focus on training your arms next. Understood?
Humboldt: Okay... understood!

Roca: All the tourist attractions in Natlan are kind of like this. You'll get used to it.
Humboldt: I see... Guess I'll take your word for it?
