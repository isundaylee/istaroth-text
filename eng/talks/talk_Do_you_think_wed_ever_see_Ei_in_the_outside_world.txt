Yae Miko: Do you think we'd ever see Ei in the outside world again if there were this many stories to read in her Plane of Euthymia? ...I, for one, rather doubt it.
Yae Miko: Hmm, I have an idea. Let's tell her that we know a wonderful little domain full of light novels and Tricolor Dango. It's high time she got out of Tenshukaku for a bit.
Yae Miko: Ah yes, and Dango Milk too. ...Hmm? They don't have it here? Well, don't look at me, little one, that's your job. Sort it out. Where there's a will, there's a way.
