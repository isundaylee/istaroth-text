# Rainbow Aster

A unique drink. Having featured in the famous light novel "Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?", it has since been brought to life by Sailing Breeze in collaboration with Yae Publishing House, along with its fascinating flavor. As this version does not contain any bean products, it is slightly different from the special limited edition that was available during the Irodori Festival, but this also means that there's no risk of triggering any bean allergies.
