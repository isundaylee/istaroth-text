Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Oh my, if isn't my little girl's pal? You here to hang out with her again?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: I've heard that the two of you brought a new friend along. Heard that it's some cute little red kid, too. Make sure you two give her the tour, eh?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: And once the festival ban on pyrotechnics comes down, get Yoimiya to make her a special custom firework, haha!

## Talk

Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Wow, where did you come from, youngster? You're looking quite snazzy!
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Are you here to buy fireworks? If you came to this place, it means that you know what the real deal is, hahaha!

## Talk

Traveler: Can I ask about those fireworks?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Ahaha, well, I'm no longer the owner of Naganohara Fireworks.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: I am far too old. My ears aren't as sharp as they were before, so I left the shop to my daughter.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: However, even if I no longer run the shop anymore, I am still very confident in my ability to make fireworks! The fireworks from my shop are guaranteed to be the best. Everyone from Inazuma knows about the Naganohara Fireworks Show.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: The other shops can't even hope to match the fireworks I've made in terms of styles and variety. Hahaha!

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Leaving already? The Fireworks Show is this way, you know? Don't get lost now.

Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Oh, if isn't my little girl's new pal? You here to hang out with her again?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Make sure you go check out the fireworks if you have the chance, hahaha!

## Talk

Traveler: How many kinds of fireworks are there here?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: If you're asking about fireworks, it's a long story from a long time ago...
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Transportation wasn't very convenient back then, so people on different islands found it hard to communicate with each other.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: One day, people suddenly discovered the various uses of fire. Apart from keeping warm, the smoke fire creates can also be seen from far away...
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Much later on... people invented fireworks, hahaha.

## Talk

Traveler: You seem to have skipped a fair bit of that story...
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: The colors, shapes, and firing intervals of fireworks all have different meanings. Inazumans in the past used this method to communicate with each other from somewhere far away.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: It takes a lot of skill and knowledge to manufacture fireworks. Using the powder from different ores will result in different colors.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: I'm the best at tuning the color of these fireworks. I can make any color that you pick, even black or white!

## Talk

Traveler: The Naganohara Fireworks Show?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Oh, you mean my daughter? That girl can pick up anything very quickly. But she can be pretty reckless too. She's gotten herself in trouble a lot.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: She was once invited by the Yashiro Commission to host a ceremony, but she accidentally started a very big fire. The fire brigade was very angry...
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: The fire brigade wanted to ban fireworks at the ceremony at that time. But how could we let that happen? The Fireworks Show is an essential part of life in Inazuma, after all. Banning fireworks would be like making Onigiri without rice or ramen without noodles.

## Talk

Traveler: Fire brigade?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Ah, what did you say again? My ears aren't that good... Oh, you mean the Naganohara Fireworks Show, right?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: We can't talk about Fireworks Show without mentioning fireworks. A long time ago...
