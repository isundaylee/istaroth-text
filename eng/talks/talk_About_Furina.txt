Aeife: Lady Furina's very lovely, like the soft seafoam reflecting the sunlight.
Aeife: But her temper was... Well, she was hard to read. Sometimes, she was like tempestuous waves, and other times, like stagnant water in a deep pool.
Aeife: But I don't feel like that anymore.
Aeife: Lady Furina seemed very cheerful the last time I saw her. She said she might be able to come to the opera house more often! I do hope she does.
