# Missing title (1068106903)


## Talk 1

Paimon: Huh? What are you looking at?
Traveler: There are notes about taking care of flowers in this notebook.
Paimon: Really? Paimon wants to see...
Paimon: "... Should be placed in open space, and receive plenty of sunshine..."
Paimon: Guess Collei didn't have the time to move it outside.
Paimon: Hee-hee, let's take care of it for Collei then.
Paimon: Hmm... Anyway, we should move the flower first. Let's put it beside the house.
Paimon: Don't put it too far away, or Collei will be worried if she can't find it when she's back.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hmm, this letter seems to be written by Collei. Let's check it out.
Traveler: But why isn't she here...
Paimon: Might be out working with Tighnari again. They have always been really busy.
Paimon: Come on, read the letter. Just looking at this writing, Paimon bets Collei pressed down her pen really hard on the letter...
Paimon: #"{NICKNAME} and Paimon, thanks for caring for my flower."
Paimon: "We have so many things to deal with in the forest, and it's easy to forget about things when we get busy..."
Paimon: "Thanks again for your help. Let's eat some Potato Boats at Mr. Jahangir's place when I have some free time!"
Paimon: Whoa! Collei is gonna give us a treat! Paimon will write this down and remember it by heart.
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon still has no idea what Collei is working on. She seems to have her hands full.
Paimon: Paimon hopes she's still getting enough sleep...
