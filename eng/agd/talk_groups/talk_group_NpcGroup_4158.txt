Traveler: And you are...
Durgar: Good day. I am the carpenter here. If you need any woodwork done, I'm your guy.
Durgar: I handle everyone's carpentry needs around here. Fair prices and reliable quality guaranteed.
Durgar: The newly arrived wood is really something — firm, durable, and has a beautiful texture. If you'd like to let me build you something with this lumber, you'd better make up your mind quick.
Durgar: This is a blessing from Lesser Lord Kusanali. I must make sure every piece of it is made into quality products.

Traveler: About Lesser Lord Kusanali...
Durgar: The fact that Sumeru people are living in a place where trees and flowers flourish instead of struggling amidst barren deserts is all thanks to the kindness of the Lord Kusanali.
Durgar: Greater Lord Rukkhadevata left roots and nutrients to Sumeru, which have now been inherited and protected by Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Durgar: So now, all our harvests are born from her mercy.
Durgar: And since I live by carpentry, which is closely related to trees, I am even more grateful to the Dendro Archon!

Traveler: About Lesser Lord Kusanali...
Durgar: The fact that Sumeru people are living in a place where trees and flowers flourish instead of struggling amidst barren deserts is all thanks to the kindness of Lord Kusanali.
Durgar: She lay down the roots and fertilized the land — all our harvests, whether in the fields or in life, stem from her.
Durgar: And since carpentry's how I make my living, a trade that's plenty close to the trees, I'm all the more grateful to the Dendro Archon!
