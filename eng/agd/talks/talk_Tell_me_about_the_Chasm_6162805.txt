Traveler: Tell me about the Chasm.
Shizhuang the Strong: Before that, it was the biggest mine in Liyue in terms of output. Finest ore you'll find anywhere, and it's chock-full of jade stones too.
Shizhuang the Strong: Under pressure from our buyers to meet demand, I had the boys working round the clock at this place. And then one day, they dug up... something very strange...
Shizhuang the Strong: In an effort to contain it, the Qixing insisted on sealing the place off, despite it going against their immediate interests...
Shizhuang the Strong: Now that did surprise me. It's not like those big business types to look past the Mora signs in their eyes.
