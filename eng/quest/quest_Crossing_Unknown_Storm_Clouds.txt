# Crossing Unknown Storm Clouds

Muzhen: Thanks to the clues you brought back, I'm now able to pinpoint the location of the Ruin machines.
Muzhen: However, we need to take care of a little problem before we do that...
Muzhen: There are some Electro anomalies nearby that are interfering with the tracking process. I'll give you the locations of these anomalies... Please, get rid of them.
Muzhen: Just as before, I'll need you to bring some samples back... Firstly, to study how I might use them.
Muzhen: And secondly... well, we are a merchant fleet, after all. We've got to see if they've got any commercial worth, of course!
Traveler: And how are your studies going on that front?
Muzhen: Hmm... The samples that you've given me, if properly used, might give The Crux Fleet a new way of dodging thunderstorms with ease that doesn't rely on our mobility.
Muzhen: If so, it would make our commercial route to and from Inazuma much more secure, and we would have more guaranteed efficiency.
Muzhen: However, seeing as the Sakoku Decree is the Shogun's will, such actions may displease her...
Muzhen: So of course, the most direct result of our research is that we can use the "age" and "life" of these anomalous Electro growths to determine the size and origin of Electro anomalies.
Muzhen: These origins, of course, are the targets we're looking for: the ancient, mysterious Ruin organisms!
Muzhen: Hehe, sorry, got a little carried away there...
Muzhen: Well then. This is the final stretch. Let's get going!
