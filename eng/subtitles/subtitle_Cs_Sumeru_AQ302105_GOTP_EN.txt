Civilization is born of knowledge
But so, too, can knowledge be its demise
A disaster caught us unaware
It was knowledge that did not belong to this world
King Deshret brought this forbidden knowledge into our world
And it quickly spread like a plague
People's minds were filled with crazed whispers
Dark gray scales spread across their bodies
Even the land was stripped of its vigor
Only a desperate, deathly silence remained
Were it not for Greater Lord Rukkhadevata from the forests
The damage would have been irreversible
She summoned the priests to build temples
And infused into them the divine power of life
The disaster was miraculously tempered
And the embers of our civilization were preserved in Aaru Village
Alas, the miracle could not last
As long as forbidden knowledge continued to exist
It would forever blight this world
In the end
The proud king of the desert... my eternal lord...
Chose to sacrifice himself
I have spent my whole life since guarding one of these many temples
But now, my duty is coming to an end
As I close my eyes for the final time
The sight of that noble deity will appear in my vision once more...
In helping King Deshret to eradicate forbidden knowledge
She exhausted her strength, and her form became that of a small child
How strange
Now that I think of her, I no longer have any fear of death...
For I sense that
The spirit of life will abide with me during my eternal sleep
Children of the desert
Cling no longer to past grievances
But hold tight to the memory
Of this act of benevolence
