# A Private Commission

Paimon: Hmm, where do we go from here...? What's the plan?
Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler, Paimon. Hold on.
Paimon: Huh? Ayaka?
Traveler: What's the matter?
Kamisato Ayaka: Something has come up, and I would like to request your assistance.
Kamisato Ayaka: But you ought not be nervous. This is not coming from the Yashiro Commission or the Kamisato Clan. It is my own individual request.
Paimon: Individual request? You mean... personal stuff?
Kamisato Ayaka: Correct. It concerns my mother.
Kamisato Ayaka: This may seem a little sudden... but in my view, you are the only person I can entrust this to.
Traveler: Can you give me any more details?
Kamisato Ayaka: A few days ago, I was sorting through some old family belongings when I found a notebook that belonged to my mother.
Kamisato Ayaka: She wrote about all kinds of things, mostly of little consequence. But what drew my attention was a name — it is one that I have never heard before, so the fact that she mentions it so frequently... it makes it difficult for me to ignore...
Paimon: Probably your mom's best buddy, right?
Traveler: You'd really never heard the name before? Not once?
Kamisato Ayaka: Never. And although my mother and father passed away many years ago, both my brother and I are familiar with the vast majority of their acquaintances.
Kamisato Ayaka: So... I am very curious about this mysterious individual. I would very much like to meet them.
Kamisato Ayaka: According to the notebook, their name is "Tsubaki." This seems to have been someone very important to my mother. Someone with a lot of personality, who liked to have fun.
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon thinks it sounds like a girl's name.
Kamisato Ayaka: That's what I thought too.
Paimon: So, what do you want us to do?
Paimon: Do you need us to find her for you?
Kamisato Ayaka: No, no, her address is given in the notebook — we can head straight there. I wanted you to assist me with the preparation of greeting gifts...
Kamisato Ayaka: ...Please keep everything I have told you in strict confidence.
Kamisato Ayaka: The proper course of action would be to involve my brother and visit her together, but he is terribly busy at present, and... on a more selfish note, I don't wish to involve anybody else from Inazuma in this matter.
Traveler: Hence why you came to me, an outlander.
Kamisato Ayaka: Exactly. That, and you are also a kind, well-mannered person with a genuine concern for other people... not to mention trustworthy. I would not feel comfortable with anyone else in this situation.
Paimon: You can count on us! We've done greeting gifts before, so we should be able to help. In terms of payment... just treat us to some delicious food, and we'll be more than happy!
Kamisato Ayaka: Wonderful — in fact, I was hoping to take this opportunity to show you both around. If you don't mind, of course?
Paimon: #Oh, we don't mind! We don't mind at all! Do we, Traveler?
Traveler: Not in the slightest.
Kamisato Ayaka: Thank you kindly! Shall we head off, then? Ogura Textiles & Kimonos is our first stop.
Paimon: Alright! Sounds great!
