They say that when Lady Ningguang ponders important affairs
She retreats to her Jade Chamber
With none but her three closest confidantes in tow
Why brings she these trusted three?
To sift through sources, dig through documents
Looking for information
Piece by piece, facts and figures
Paint a picture on the walls of the chamber...
But well before the wall is filled
Lady Ningguang's mind is made up
Having made her call
She has every last document shredded
And fwoosh! She scatters the shavings out her window
Ah, look at them!
How they billow in the wind
Like a sudden swirling blizzard!
As the fragments fall
Traces of text
Flicker before the eyes of the merchants of Liyue
Like ink stains in white snow
The saying goes:
The rarest treasures in the land
Are the words brought by the paper snow
For the words of the Tianquan have the power to move mountains
And all throughout the land know it
