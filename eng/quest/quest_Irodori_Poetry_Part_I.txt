# Irodori Poetry: Part I


## Talk 1

Ootomo: #{F#Miss}{M#Mister}, I see that you've been walking back and forth in this area for some time now. I believe you must be someone who appreciates the elegance of the arts.
Ootomo: There is a question of elegance that I might need your help with. Would you mind lending me your aid?
Traveler: Yes, what is it?
Ootomo: Though I have only just met this man, Lenne, a bard from Mondstadt, over here, we have already become fast friends.
Lenne: Ootomo speaks the truth. We have only known each other for a few days, but I already have the greatest respect for his great learning.
Ootomo: Hehe, you are too kind, Lenne. In any case, we have made friends through poetry, and we're taking this opportunity to write a few collaborative works.
Ootomo: And since Lenne has gone through all the effort to come to Inazuma, he really wants to add a bit of that Inazuman flavor to his work.
Lenne: Indeed. Unfortunately, my itinerary has been far too tight. I haven't had time to really go around and see the sights.
Traveler: So, what can I do for you?
Lenne: Friend, the theme of the poem I wish to write is "nostalgia."
Lenne: Upon seeing the sights in a distant land, a vagabond cannot help but remember their home. That is why I need to add some things into my poem that symbolize this distant place.
Lenne: Could you help me take a few pictures from which I can draw some inspiration?
Lenne: Inazuma should have a great number of unique sights to see, yes? For example, when you speak of Mondstadt, everyone's minds will turn to Dandelions or Windwheel Asters...
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon gets it now. Well in that case, let's take a few pictures of some of Inazuma's regional specialties! That should do it.
Lenne: Indeed, I would be in your debt if you would! Allow me to also write a copy of my half-done poem manuscript, just for you to use as reference material.
Lenne: As for the number of pictures that I will need, I think <color=#00E1FFFF>4</color>, each showcasing different contents, will do. I will also pay for any travel fees you may incur in the process.
Paimon: #Well, {NICKNAME}, since Lenne's request seems clear, let's head out right now!

## Talk 2

Lenne: Ah, it's you. Have you finished taking those pictures?
Traveler: Not yet...
Lenne: Remember, you just need to take <color=#00E1FFFF>4</color> pictures of Inazuman regional specialties.

## Talk 3

Ootomo: Hmmm, purple symbolizes Her Excellency. These two lines really do have an Inazuman flavor.

## Talk 4

Ootomo: Hmmm, the meaning of these two is that "the wind brings the flowers' fragrance," which is intimately linked to the line that follows immediately after.

### Additional Talk 1

Lenne: Ah, it's you. Have you finished taking those pictures?
Traveler: I've taken them.
Lenne: Wonderful! You have my thanks. Let me have a look... Oh my, I've never seen any of these! ...And ah, this picture is wonderful! This one also seems quite noteworthy...
Lenne: Friend, your photos are a true inspiration! Many thanks.
Lenne: Now, I have attempted to write several different stanzas according to the pictures you provided me. I'm quite torn as to which to use...
Lenne: I'm quite curious, actually. If it were you, which would you use?

### Additional Talk 2

Ootomo: The emotions in these two are very strongly felt, and the atmosphere they create is quite ethereal.

### Additional Talk 3

Ootomo: These two match the preceding lines the closest, and they are rhythmically fitting when read.

### Additional Talk 4

Ootomo: These two lines discuss the gains and losses we sustain with the passage of time, and how someone journeying far abroad comes to understand the meaning of home.

### Additional Talk 5

Ootomo: #{F#Miss}{M#Mister}... You truly have a good eye.
Lenne: Ootomo, since both you and our new friend here are both very enamored of these two lines, then let us use them.
Lenne: Friend, thank you once again for your aid.
