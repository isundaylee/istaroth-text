Traveler: You really did bring a weapon!
Delaroche: Hehe, that's right! I asked a friend at the Adventurers' Guild to procure it. Apparently, it's a foreign model...
Delaroche: While it's not as elegant to use as pistolets, it's simple, cheap, and easy to maintain.
Delaroche: O strange aquatic creature, you'd better pray I don't catch you. Otherwise, special treatment shall be in order!
