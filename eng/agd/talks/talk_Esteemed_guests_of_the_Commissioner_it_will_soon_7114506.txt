Kuromaro: Esteemed guests of the Commissioner, it will soon be time for us to depart homeward. Seeing how busy you've been of late, I did not dare disturb you. If I have been remiss, please accept my apologies.
Traveler: No need to be so formal. You were here for the meeting after all!
Kuromaro: I am indeed here to learn, and thus it is only right that I should treat and address all the accomplished warriors present with the utmost humility.
Kuromaro: Fortunately, I can say with confidence that my attendance will not have disappointed the Commissioner's expectations. In the course of this trip, we have learned much and recorded many key findings.
Kuromaro: Based on these findings, the Shogun's Army will be able to focus on adapting their tactics, such that the vagrant ronin and bandits that roam our islands can be more efficiently dealt with...
Kuromaro: I only hope that, when the time is right, you will have a chance to visit Inazuma once more and witness the fruits of our labor.
Traveler: The pleasure would be all mine. Please give Ayato and Ayaka my regards!
Kuromaro: Your magnanimity has left a deep impression on me. I shall be sure to pass on your fine words to the Commissioner and Miss Kamisato!
