Traveler: You've got penguins here in Fontaine?
Livre: Uh... Sorry, I wasn't being very precise.
Livre: Usually, penguins live in the cold north, but I've also heard that some of them will appear in places with a warmer climate.
Livre: The penguins in our store weren't made by me — they're consignments made by a young lad named Freminet.
Livre: He's very good, if I do say so myself — reminds me of my younger brother, in fact.
Livre: I once thought of inviting him to develop clockwork toys, but he remained silent, and I didn't really want to force the issue.
