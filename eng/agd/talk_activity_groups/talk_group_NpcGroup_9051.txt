## Talk

Eula: #Oh, Traveler, it's you? What is it?

## Talk

Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Eula: Huh, what kind of question is that?
Eula: I'm certainly not someone who's good at handing out compliments.
Traveler: I just want to know your feelings.
Eula: ...Pointless. You think I'm some kind of tender soul?
Eula: Neither good nor bad. There you go.
Traveler: Is that so?
Eula: Hey, have you been watching me while I'm not looking?
Eula: (Darn it... How did I not notice?)
Eula: Anyway... Vengeance will be mine.
Traveler: You clearly had a gentle expression before...

## Talk

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Eula: Didn't think you were the type to get bored... Sure, speak.
Traveler: Anything happen recently that makes you want to seek vengeance?
Eula: Hmm... Let me think.
Eula: Not long ago, I took on an assignment to clear out some nearby Treasure Hoarders.
Eula: On my way back, I rescued a Springvale hunter who was being attacked by a monster.
Eula: ...I didn't expect him to send meat and wine the next day.
Eula: Daring to send things despite knowing that I'm the heir to the sinners of Mondstadt... I'll remember this insult.
Traveler: An insult worth remembering.
Eula: Not just that.
Eula: The meat was so good that I ate too much and got a stomach ache, so I couldn't properly enjoy the wine...
Traveler: This deserves some more vengeance.
Eula: Haha, we're of the same mind.
Eula: ...
Eula: Just this simple chat with you has made me feel a lot better...
Eula: Ahem... Thanks.
Traveler: You weren't injured, were you?
Eula: Ha, a small fry like that monster can't hurt me.
Eula: However, the meat was so good that I ate too much and got a stomach ache, so I couldn't properly enjoy the wine...
Traveler: It was that delicious? I want some too...
Eula: Hahaha, best not. If you really want... I'll make a Stormcrest Pie for you.

## Talk

Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Eula: That I'd like to do? Why are you asking?
Traveler: Because I want to accompany you.
Eula: ...
Eula: What a weird statement.
Eula: If that's the case, then let me teach you how to dance. Specifically, the "Dance of Sacrifice."
Eula: I told you, I've incorporated dance into my swordplay. If you want to learn my sword techniques, you'll need to learn to dance first.
Eula: Actually, dance is also my favorite artistic pastime...
Eula: It's time for you to learn.
Traveler: Is there a duet?
Eula: Practice your basic dance steps first, then we'll talk.
Eula: Such avarice. I ought to reserve the darkest and most grievous of vengeance for you...
Eula: But thinking about it... Since we're already this far, then I'll turn a blind eye to any new grievance.
Eula: After all, my vengeance for you runs deep... It has long been inextricable.
Traveler: If I step on your feet...
Eula: Then I ought to reserve the darkest and most grievous of vengeance for you...

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Eula.
Eula: Ah... Morning.
Eula: #Remember, I have yet to enact vengeance upon you... You better return in one piece, Traveler.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Eula.
Eula: #Good night, Traveler.
Eula: Someone as purehearted as you probably sleeps better than anyone else...

## Talk

Eula: It's completely furnished, is well-placed, enjoys good lighting... Yes, this bedroom will do just fine.
Eula: Some members of the aristocracy hanker after decorations of luxury and beauty, but arrange the room in an absolutely horrific manner... I detest such aristocratic customs.
Eula: But this place... now this a place one can really relax.

## Talk

Eula: This study... it brings back some memories.
Eula: As a child, I tried all sorts of ways to avoid books that taught aristocratic etiquette, but to no avail â€” I had no choice but to memorize them all.
Eula: Forget it, it's all in the past now. I shouldn't get myself down, I must look ahead to my new life.
