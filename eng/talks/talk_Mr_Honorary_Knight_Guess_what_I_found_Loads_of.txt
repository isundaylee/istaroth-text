# Talk Dialog

Klee: #Mr. Honorary Knight! Guess what I found? Loads of stories that Mommy used to read to me!
Klee: Whenever I shouted out, "Nooo, we can't let that happen!" Mommy would give me a pen and paper and let me finish the rest of the story myself.
Klee: By climbing through the window, or popping out from a nearby bush, or coming down from a tree... I always found a way to bring Dodoco into the story!
