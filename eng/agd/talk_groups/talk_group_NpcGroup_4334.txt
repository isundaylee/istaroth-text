Traveler: And you are?
Kurash: I'm Kurash, I'm not from here, either.
Kurash: I gained quite a few skills while living in the desert, and I planned to join the Eremites.
Kurash: But just thinking about running around for my employers gives me a headache... It's better to just find a village and live a life that's fulfilling and leisurely.
Kurash: Look, even Granny Jehiet chose to retire here!

Kurash: I didn't expect her to be living here... and even adopt a little boy.
Kurash: It's so unbelievable, I mean, she is "The Lioness" after all...
