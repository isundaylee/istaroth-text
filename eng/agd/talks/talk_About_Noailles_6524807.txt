Estienne: He's sick. In the head. You get people like that, sometimes.
Estienne: If it was just about sticking to his principles, it wouldn't be an issue. But he tries to use the powers he's been given to force everyone else to adhere to his principles.
Estienne: *sigh* Perhaps I should say the timing was just awful? Anyway, he's paying the price for what he did now and he won't be back anytime soon. Maybe he'll never get the chance to return.
