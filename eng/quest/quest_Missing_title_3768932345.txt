## Talk 1

Bulletin Board: This Ritou Harbor bulletin board was set up by the Shogunate. Notices regarding all kinds of matters will be posted here. Do not post without authorization.

## Talk 2

Bulletin Board: A number of suspicious outlanders have entered Inazuma lately, wandering around with seemingly sinister motives.
Bulletin Board: The Shogunate hereby notifies everyone: those who report suspicious persons will be rewarded, while those who harbor them will be punished!
Bulletin Board: Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!

## Talk 3

Bulletin Board: The Vision Hunt Decree operation is coming to an end, but those who conceal their Visions still remain.
Bulletin Board: Following the orders of the Tenryou Commissioner, and in compliance with the command of Madam Kujou Sara, pursuit operations will avoid using force or disrupting the public as much as possible.
Bulletin Board: Please don't worry. The Tenryou Commission will not use its public duties as an excuse to intrude on your daily lives.
Bulletin Board: The Tenryou Commissioner guarantees this in his own name, and that of the Kujou Clan.

## Talk 4

Bulletin Board: "Kujou Tengu! I'm still in Ritou! Did you flee again?"
Bulletin Board: "You must've fled in the night after hearing my name, eh?"
Bulletin Board: "Haha, is my name scarier than the battlefield?"
Bulletin Board: "That's fine! I'll wait for your return here at the harbor!"
Bulletin Board: "Don't you dare die on the battlefield, Kujou Tengu! You still owe me a duel!"
Bulletin Board: Shut it. Are you done yet?
Bulletin Board: If this is some kind of blessing before I set out for war, then I will accept it.
Bulletin Board: You don't get yourself killed either, you idiotic Crimson Oni.

## Talk 5

Bulletin Board: "Though this is not a serious matter, I still hope that it will become more common knowledge."
Bulletin Board: "The other day, I accidentally lost the only extant copy of the famous 'Toki Alley Tales,' written by Takizawa Kyouden."
Bulletin Board: "Though it's nothing major, Lady Yae still insisted that I post a lost book notice to look for it. Ah, what a headache..."
Bulletin Board: "That poor book has probably had its pages scattered to the winds by now... I don't suppose it would be possible to find it at this point."
Bulletin Board: "It really is nothing of note, but if anyone could help recover it, you will have the Yae Publishing House's thanks."

## Talk 6

Bulletin Board: All outlanders seeking to enter Ritou while the Sakoku Decree is in effect must provide valid documentation or they will be prohibited from landing.
Bulletin Board: Prohibited items are not allowed in Ritou. Weapons, camping gear and foreign specialties must be registered for taxation.
Bulletin Board: Please take care of your documentation and personal identification. They will not be replaced if lost!
Bulletin Board: Anyone who has been in contact with the Sangonomiya must be put under surveillance in Ritou for one year and will not be allowed to leave.

## Talk 7

Bulletin Board: "Outlander merchants, if you are facing any issues or difficulties in Ritou"
Bulletin Board: "Come find Mr. Kurisu at the International Trade Association. We will do our best to help you!"
Bulletin Board: "If there is anything that you don't understand or that troubles you, come look for us."
Bulletin Board: "The International Trade Association's doors are always open to outlanders from any nation."

## Talk 8

Bulletin Board: "Piracy is becoming more rampant lately. I've heard that soldiers from both sides of the war have fallen into banditry..."
Bulletin Board: "Since outlander cargo ships are not protected by the Shogunate, they often become targets of opportunity. It's despicable..."
Bulletin Board: "To our mariner friends who see this message, please stock up on supplies when leaving Ritou Harbor."
Bulletin Board: "Weapons, fresh water, repair tools, spare materials, please do not hold back on the procurement of these items."

## Talk 9

Bulletin Board: "I've heard that a large fleet has arrived from Liyue, but I don't know where they are docked."
Bulletin Board: "Their flagship is especially large. As long as the other outlander ships follow its mast and stay with the fleet, they won't have to worry about pirates..."
Bulletin Board: "It's a shame. I've only heard about this fleet, but I have never seen it."
Bulletin Board: "I've heard people say that this is supposedly the famous Crux Fleet."
Bulletin Board: "It's just weird when I think about it: there isn't much business to be had during the Sakoku Decree, so why are they still coming here?"

## Talk 10

Bulletin Board: There might be another round of merchant ships arriving in Ritou from Snezhnaya soon. Everyone at the harbor, please prepare for their arrival.
Bulletin Board: As a gesture of support, merchants from Snezhnaya may enjoy partial tariff reduction or exemptions.
Bulletin Board: As for Snezhnayan merchants currently residing in Ritou, please renew your certification at the Kanjou Commission headquarters at your first convenience,
Bulletin Board: So as to avoid any inconvenience in your residential, travel, or business affairs.

## Talk 11

Bulletin Board: "I wander like the autumn leaves that float to the mountains and seas afar."
Bulletin Board: "We're back! Come on, kid, give us another poem!"
Bulletin Board: This a bulletin board, not some kind of poetry forum!

## Talk 12

Bulletin Board: "The Ritou Harbor is too cautious in guarding against outlanders but too lenient with Inazumans."
Bulletin Board: "As such, all you need to travel freely in and out of territories controlled by the Shogunate is a forged local document."
Bulletin Board: "And it's not as if this is a difficult task."
Bulletin Board: What kind of idiot would post this sort of information on a bulletin board...

## Talk 13

Bulletin Board: Bounty: Yoshino Koheiji, Yoshino Koheita
Bulletin Board: Crimes committed: Absconding, robbery, night-time assaults, conspiring against officials, distributing belongings to innocent villagers to incite rebellion.
Bulletin Board: Wanted dead or alive with a generous bounty!

## Talk 14

Bulletin Board: Bounty: Midorikawa Shirou
Bulletin Board: Crimes committed: Absconding, riotous assembly, piracy, robbing officials, ambushing samurai, holding family members as hostages in an attempt to rebel against the Shogunate.
Bulletin Board: This person and his accomplices are wanted dead or alive with a generous bounty!

## Talk 15

Bulletin Board: "Kiyoko, I like you."
Bulletin Board: "I am an outlander who has just arrived and thus knows nothing, but it's okay."
Bulletin Board: "As long as you pay the guards Mora, their eyes and mouths are shut. We can go on dates wherever we want."
Bulletin Board: "And I have no shortage of Mora..."
Bulletin Board: "Well, my father has no shortage of Mora, to be precise. Haha."

## Talk 16

Bulletin Board: With the permission of Guuji Yae Miko, the Grand Narukami Shrine will provide help to those businesses and families affected by the war in the form of aid loans and food aid.
Bulletin Board: We ask that those in need of help visit the Kamisato Clan to file the required paperwork.
Bulletin Board: (Outlanders with valid documentation will also receive some form of subsidy.)
Bulletin Board: As the war continues and public funds become more tight, food aid will be reduced by half. We apologize for any inconvenience.
Bulletin Board: "I arrived at the Kamisato Clan estate but was told to keep out. What subsidy are you blabbering about?"
Bulletin Board: "My merchant friends also did not receive any benefits either... How strange."
Bulletin Board: We apologize, but did you perhaps come late? Once all the daily subsidies have been given out, we will no longer register new applicants.
Bulletin Board: "Oh, so that's why everyone got up so early..."

## Talk 17

Bulletin Board: To avoid congestion at the harbor because of the war, docking fees for outlander commercial ships have been increased fourfold.
Bulletin Board: Please submit any feedback to the Kanjou Commission.
Bulletin Board: Docking fees for commercial ships will be collected by the International Trade Association as per normal. No exceptions.
Bulletin Board: "What do you mean, 'congestion at the harbor'? It's the soldiers who are occupying the harbor! And yet we have to pay for it..."
Bulletin Board: I am sorry, but leaving the harbor is free.
