# Mavuika Voicelines

## Hello
With the flames to guide us across time, we took a land shrouded in darkness, and used our own blood and tears to forge it into a home. Now, our journey continues, and a new chapter awaits. As the current Pyro Archon, allow me, Mavuika, to light your way forward.

## Chat: Adventures
Exploration and trials... Heh, adventuring is right up my alley.

## Chat: Experience
Instead of confining themselves to the heavens, gods should broaden their horizons in the world below.

## Chat: Light
Many insects have a compulsion to follow the light, and humans are the same — except we call that light, "hope."

## When It Snows
Ah, nice and cool. Natlan doesn't have places like this.

## When the Sun Is Out
Weather like this is perfect for enjoying the outdoors. Wanna go for a spin? Here, hop on.

## After the Rain
Ah, you're dripping wet. That must be uncomfortable... Let's take a break. I'll use my fire to dry you off.

## In the Desert
Sand is the natural enemy of fire and civilization. In the desert, ruins are all that remain to tell the story of the past.

## Good Morning
After waking up, I always go over the plan for the day in my head... Unfortunately, sleeping in is never on the agenda.

## Good Afternoon
Have you had lunch? The Collective of Plenty sent over some fresh fruit — the perfect thing to round out a meal. Here, try some.

## Good Evening
Hm, so this is the proposal and approximate budget to rebuild the roads in the Children of Echoes... Oh, good evening. Is it that late already?

## Good Night
Good Night! I'm going to take it easy and wrap up some work. Oh, don't worry — I see keeping busy as a great way to relax.

## About Mavuika: Hair
Oh, my hair? Don't worry, these are friendly flames — they won't burn you or incinerate anything. Although, I think our enemies will find that it's a bad idea to play with fire, if you know what I mean.

## About Mavuika: Message
Every Pyro Archon throughout Natlan's history has left behind important knowledge and memories within the Sacred Flame, for the benefit of future successors. When inherited, the sheer amount of information can impact your sense of self. So, I chose to leave behind this phrase, "Before you become one with flame, be proud of who you are now."

## About Us: Fighting Side By Side
A plan is a reliable guide, but it's not an unchangeable or divine decree. Five hundred years ago, I could never have anticipated your arrival. But, after meeting you, I knew factoring you into my plan would be worth it. Judging from the outcome, choosing to fight by your side was unequivocally the right choice.

## About Us: Ancient Names
You may not have realized this, but your ancient name, Tumaini, will have a significant impact on Natlan for years to come. When future generations speak this name, they will think about this battle and the efforts of all our heroes. Our names — Tumaini and Kiongozi — are now linked and will live on in perpetuity.

## About the Vision
For humans, Visions and Ancient Names are both gifts from the gods, where the former bestows Elemental power and the latter spiritual inspiration. However, I have always believed that no external factor is a condition for greatness — heroism comes from within.

## Something to Share
When I was little, my father told me that a barrel can only hold as much water as the shortest plank. If you want to reach your full potential, you need to be willing to become the weakest link, to acknowledge your shortcomings and learn from others. That doesn't make you a failure, it pushes you to succeed.

## Interesting Things
Baby Yumkasaurs are incredibly cute, and my Saurian companion, Hitata, was especially clingy. He used to jump into my arms the minute he saw me, even from quite a distance. My sister, Hine, would get so jealous — whenever she saw Hitata run towards me, she would do the same. Before I knew it, I would have an armful of baby Saurian and baby sister at the same time, haha.

## About Xilonen
Xilonen is one of the best craftsmen in Natlan. She has the ability to forge Ancient Names and is well-versed in Secret Source technology. Not to mention, she never backs away from a challenge, even when it's completely uncharted territory. The process isn't without twists and turns — like design changes and other modifications — but the results speak for themselves.

## About Citlali
Many people find her strange or difficult to get along with. But, this is how I see it — Citlali doesn't concern herself with trivial matters, but she's always there when it counts. I'm sure you've seen that for yourself. She's someone who can easily tunnel vision and get herself embroiled in trouble, so I try to keep certain things from her. But, she can see right through me... She's too sharp.

## About Chasca
Being able to survive under the influence of Abyssal corrosion was already a miracle, but thanks to the people and Saurians of this land, she even found a reason not just to survive, but to live. I have every faith in her fortitude, but I will still do what I can to make this land a "gentler" place — even the strongest among us need a break sometimes.

## About Ororon
In my opinion, Ororon's true personality is very different from what he projects on the outside — like lava covered in ice. His tribe and his friends bring him peace, but his drive to protect them and his need to become a hero leave him restless. It's inadvisable to act on impulse, but these are precious qualities all the same.

## About Iansan: Being Targeted
A lot of people underestimated Iansan during her first few Pilgrimages after receiving her Ancient Name, and singled her out during the team stage as an easy target. Even though she never lost, the constant challengers drained her stamina and affected her ranking, which only made people more likely to target her...

## About Iansan: Proving Yourself
My advice to her was this — people are less likely to mess with someone whose strength is undeniable, so all she needed to do was to prove it. Well, she decided to do just that... by challenging me in the arena, hahaha. Yeah, I definitely didn't see that coming! In the end, she put up quite the fight, and no one underestimated her again.

## About Mualani
In terms of personality, Mualani and Tupac are completely different, and yet both inherited the name, Umoja. Unity lies not in a particular action, but in a state of mind — a willingness to give your all for your nation, family and friends. But, I doubt Mualani was thinking about any of that back then. She knew one thing to be true — that Kachina's life was worth any risk to her own.

## About Kinich
In addition to the Turnfire, Malipo has another meaning, "cost" or "price." It may seem less overtly heroic compared to the other Ancient Names, but in truth, Malipo teaches us to be calm and analytical — to ask the questions people may not want to hear. Without people who possess these qualities, it's just too easy for the rest of us to act on impulse and emotion, and make decisions we'll come to regret.

## About Kachina
After you rescued Kachina from the Night Kingdom, I visited her family with Chief Pacal, and brought a few gifts to once again apologize for what happened. Kachina's time in the Night Kingdom left her with many scars she will have to carry into the future — scars she should never have had to bear... And for that, the fault is mine.

## About Varesa
During the Pilgrimage, I cover all the expenses at the Weary Inn, and without fail, there's always an order for a party tray for eighty. I used to assume it was someone ordering for a large group of friends, but as it turns out... Varesa ordered it all for herself.

## About Ifa
The truly great doctors often possess vast medical knowledge as well as great communication skills. And, when the patient and the doctor do not speak the same language, observation and empathy become even more important. That's why Ifa can make friends with just about anyone.
Suffice it to say, if someone is on bad terms with Ifa — human or saurian — I doubt the problem lies with him, haha.

## About The Captain
For him, I suspect the past five hundred years felt endless. When someone is deprived of death, life becomes a journey with no end, and the human spirit easily grows weary. And yet, he managed to seize the only chance of victory to arrive at the end he sought all along. I have great respect for warriors like him.

## About The Seven
To be quite honest, you likely know them better than me. However, their nations continue to survive and thrive to this day, and that would be impossible without strong leadership. Once this chapter of Natlan's history comes to a close, I plan on strengthening our relationship with other nations so that Natlan can continue to grow.

## About Yumemizuki Mizuki
Ah, she left a very positive impression. When she first arrived in Natlan, I heard that she had a great deal of interest in our hot springs and spent quite some time studying their properties. But, it wasn't for profit. She was interested in their role in improving mental health. Such a pure cause deserved our support and respect.
Speaking of which... Is it true that the current Archon of Inazuma enjoys hot springs as well? If that's the case, I believe I've found a good starting point for our next conversation.

## More About Mavuika: I
Oh, you want to know more about me? Sure, I'm actually quite fond of telling stories. Still, I think this will be a lot more fun over a few drinks.

## More about Mavuika: II
Riding the flamestrider isn't complicated, it just takes some practice. If I want to go fast, though, I would need to install some safety components. What was that? I'm already going quite fast? Well, when I asked, this is what Xilonen told me — "It's safe enough — not like you're made of glass."

## More about Mavuika: III
Of course, I also have many regrets. Thanks to my knowledge and strength, I'm an effective problem-solver, but most of the time, all people really need is companionship... I've disappointed many people in that regard, but duty stops for no one. Questioning my path will only bring more pain — I owe it to myself to stick to my convictions.

## More about Mavuika: IV
Unleashing the power of the divine throne bound my soul to the Ley Lines. As I rose up into the air, I could feel the passion of our warriors, the determination of our people, and the pain of our fallen... It's a scene I've witnessed once before. But, with the help of our heroes, this time it had a very different ending. That is how we know this struggle was not in vain.

## More about Mavuika: V
With our triumph over the Abyss, my most important duty as Pyro Archon came to an end. Five hundred years ago, I chose to fight for a future that likely wouldn't include me — so I was prepared for that result. So, when that future actually arrived, I was at a loss... But, you've inspired me. Exploration, curiosity, and dedication to others — that's the path forward.

## Mavuika's Hobbies
Getting stronger. Completing a difficult challenge, solving a complicated puzzle, defeating a powerful enemy... I don't have a singular hobby — the sense of accomplishment is what I enjoy the most.

## Mavuika's Troubles
"Due to lack of popularity, all future expansions and additions to 'The Saurian Sleuth' have been suspended..." That was my favorite tabletop puzzle game. It can't be because it was too hard or the rules were too complicated, right? That doesn't make it bad... *sigh* If it comes down to sales, there's not much I can do. I hope the creator will come out with a new game. Maybe I'll write an anonymous letter to support him...

## Favorite Food
Even when it comes to the simplest home-cooked meals, every family has their own recipe, and the flavor can change a lot. I've tried a bunch of different stews around the Stadium, each unique and delicious in its own way. But, if I'm cooking for myself, I still prefer my family recipe.

## Least Favorite Food
I like most ingredients, but I don't really appreciate dishes that are more form than substance, like a full course dinner that will take three whole hours to get through... I respect culinary innovation, of course, but I prefer to spend my time on something more productive.

## Receiving a Gift: I
Just what I like, thank you. Do you have the recipe? I'd love to learn.

## Receiving a Gift: II
Not bad overall, but there's still room for improvement.

## Receiving a Gift: III
Oh, it's surprisingly edible. Definitely not as bad as it looks.

## Birthday
#Starting from today, you should write down all your accomplishments on a piece of paper. Then, when you take it out on your next birthday, you'll have a gift from yourself! That way, you'll never forget how amazing you are. Happy Birthday, Traveler.

## Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion
Ever since we met, my power has grown by leaps and bounds. Though different missions drive us forward, a shared sense of duty and justice binds us together. Your help to Natlan is immeasurable, and I am more grateful than words can say.
