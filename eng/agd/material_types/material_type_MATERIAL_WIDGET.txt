## Anemoculus Resonance Stone

A stone that can be used in Mondstadt to search for nearby Anemoculi.
This man-made stone plate possesses a certain characteristic similar to that of the Anemo Statues of The Seven, giving it the power to resonate with Anemoculi.
Oculus Resonance Stones are crude imitations of the Statues of The Seven constructed by the ancients. But it is precisely this crudeness that makes them crave the power of elemental oculi, thus providing devout worshippers and adventurers alike a prime opportunity to collect oculi.

## Geoculus Resonance Stone

A stone that can be used in Liyue to search for nearby Geoculi.
This exquisite stone plate imitates a certain mysterious quality of the Geo Statues of The Seven, causing it to lead people to the location of Geoculi.
Elemental Oculi represent the lost power of the Statues of The Seven — perhaps offering this power back to the statues also has significance for the lands that the gods watch over.

## Geo Treasure Compass

A compass that can be used in Liyue to search for nearby treasure and relevant clues.
The land of Geo is rich with valuable resources, with treasures hidden throughout the mountains and wilderness just waiting to be found.

## Wind Catcher

A bottle that is able to hold Anemograna and use their energy to generate wind currents.
This item was designed by Knights of Favonius scholars to help the Knights on their scouting expeditions and travels by affording them the ability to better use the blessings of the Anemo God.
In order to take advantage of its wind currents with a wind glider, you technically need a gliding license — this has prevented it from becoming widely used, at least legally anyway.

## Portable Waypoint

Use this to create a temporary Teleport Waypoint at your current location. Only one can exist at a time.
A pocket-sized item that creates a temporary Teleport Waypoint. It is capable of connecting with the ley lines, at least to the extent necessary to bring about teleportation.
Although it offers an incredible convenience to Vision bearers, the actual principles behind Teleport Waypoints are not yet fully understood. We can only hope that using them does not cause any undesirable side effects...

## Adepti Seeker's Stove

A portable stove that can be quickly set up for cooking in the environment. If you enter into combat nearby, it will be destroyed.
Liyue's terrain is vast, varied, and at times even inhospitable — and yet all its inhabitants share a love of good food. These two phenomena would not be able to coexist were it not for portable cooking equipment like this. Whether you are scaling the heights of Jueyun Karst or exploring the islets of Guyun Stone Forest, bringing a portable stove means that a delicious and freshly cooked hot meal is always available at a moment's notice.

## NRE (Menu 30)

A handy meal-in-a-pouch that can transform most foods into instantly absorbable nutritional matter. Despite the fact that it can greatly increase the efficiency of nutritional intake, most knights aren't too keen to put their food in it...

## Anemo Treasure Compass

A compass that can be used in Mondstadt to search for nearby treasure and relevant clues.
The needle of the Treasure Compass doesn't spin according to the world's magnetic field, but rather follows the energy of ley lines to lead the user to treasure.

## Treasure-Seeking Seelie

A small and special Seelie, particularly sensitive to the presence of Iron Coins.
A companion entrusted to you by Ulman. Seelie are naturally inclined to guide people, though this Seelie seems weaker than usual, and possesses a remarkable obsession with Iron Coins...

A miniature golden Seelie. It gives off a feeling very similar to that of Mora. They say that Seelie of this color represent good fortune.

## Warming Bottle

Upon use, emits heat for a short period over a small area, diminishing the effect of Sheer Cold.
Warming Seelie have evolved in response to the extreme change in temperature to give the comfort of warmth to those who seek it. This convenient gadget was originally crafted by those who struggled to survive in the snowy mountains in imitation of such evolved Seelie.

A special item from Fontaine that can record images. People and places to remember must come aplenty for a Traveler roaming the world.

Ji Tong imported this new-fangled Kamera model from Fontaine, but it doesn't seem to work quite as he'd hoped...

## Special Kamera

When used, this useful gadget can save and store the scenery before it and add a special color tone to it.
A strange device from Fontaine that will not only record sceneries but will also add special colors to the printed images. This design was made in response to "The Steambird"'s request for a Kamera that could not only reflect the environment, but also the emotions of the one taking the picture. Unfortunately, the final product could not quite match their specifications.

## Parametric Transformer

A device that can transmute materials placed within and convert them into some other materials.
·During the transmutation process, you must use *Elemental Attacks* to generate enough energy for the transmutation to take place.
·After obtaining the transmuted materials, you must wait seven days to use the Parametric Transformer once again.

This mysterious device, discovered within the ruins, has the power to accelerate cycles and "transmute" material objects. Generally speaking, everything is undergoing a cycle. Memories and elements surge within the ley lines, rotten fallen fruits return to the soil, and the trees born from the soil will one day bear their crystalline fruit...

## Inquisitive Endora

A strange Lochfolk larva, filled with curiosity about the world at large.
Lochfolk specialize in shifting into watery shapes and can meld with other water bodies to synchronize emotions and knowledge alike. Endora is still small, and Endora is very curious. Endora can spit out bubbles to meld with other beings of water, through which she shall learn everything.

## Endora

Just a very curious Lochfolk who only wishes to see the world. Might actually get along very well with Mini Seelie: Dayflower, but please do not meld them together, thank you.

## Windblume Festival Commemorative Balloon

Use this to release a balloon that can be popped.
Balloons have special significance in the land of the wind, for they represent the freedom to drift with the wind. Of course, air pressure will destroy balloons once they've reached a certain height.

## Windsong Lyre

Use this traditional instrument from Mondstadt to play songs.
An instrument of incredible workmanship, it will surely produce moving music when played by able hands.
Mondstadt has a long-standing tradition of poetry and song, and thus also boasts a long history of constructing instruments to that effect. Bards are most proud of their songs and poems, and perhaps the instruments, too, would be proud of their owners and their musical tradition.

## Electroculus Resonance Stone

A stone that can be used in Inazuma to search for nearby Electroculi.
This strange device can resonate with Electro Statues of The Seven. Due to this trait, it can detect the presence of Electroculi.
Across the span of endless years, even the most majestic cities and sculptures would be worn down by wind and rain, and even the power of Statues of The Seven would gradually dissipate. But this faded strength would coalesce once more into the Oculi, which call out wordlessly to their Statues.

## Seed Dispensary

A special container obtained from Madame Ping. According to her, this dispensary has the power to "generate seeds"... That is to say, it can create the seeds of various plants according to their special traits, which can then be planted within the appropriate fields within your Serenitea Pot.

## Red Feather Fan

Use this to increase Gliding Movement SPD by 30% for 30s.

This item possesses some sort of mysterious power. In the hands of the tengu warriors, it can have various effects, but in the hands of an ordinary person, it can still have enough power to "make one's body lighter" while in mid-air.

## Memento Lens

A mysterious lens. If you view small fox statues with this lens, you can find things that were not there before.
They say that in the distant past, the legendary Kitsune Saiguu left a catalyst for the then-Hiiragi Clan head, Hiroshi, as a tool to be used in exorcisms.
The Hiiragis would have a special Kamera made to order from overseas with that catalyst mounted on its lens assembly, before giving it back to the Grand Narukami Shrine as a symbol of their friendship.

## Treasure-Seeking Seelie

A small and special Seelie, particularly sensitive to the presence of Iron Coins.
A companion entrusted to you by Ulman. Seelie are naturally inclined to guide people, though this Seelie seems weaker than usual, and possesses a remarkable obsession with Iron Coins...

## Mini Seelie: Viola

A net that has been modified once again by Wakamurasaki using onmyoudou. She claims that it can detain the essence of small creatures before using the net itself as a medium to recreate their forms.

## Floral Zither

A musical instrument that can be used in performances.
It is made of rather unique materials, and its craftsmanship is quite different from the designs that are currently in vogue. An unpredictable strength has been woven into the ethereal strings that can even allow it to cause the illusions within the heart of its player to surface.
There is an old adage in Liyue: "the longer one's eye of the flower drinks, the deeper one's heart into the mire sinks." It seems that only the strong-willed may use this instrument.

## Shiki Koshou

A gift from Shiki Taishou: a replica armed with spiritual power. Though Shiki Koshou is incapable of charm magic, it is in contact with Shiki Taishou at all times and can share all that it has seen and heard with him, so it's almost like you've still got Shiki Taishou with you on your journey.

## Ubiquity Net

A friend of Sango's used Kamuna Onmyoudou in a fit of inspiration to create this convenient little gadget. It is not powerful enough to capture criminals, but with a little aim, capturing little animals should be a cinch.

## Launch Tube

A special device created by the artisan Pengyi. It comes with functions that allow for the creation and automated launch of fireworks. In the hands of someone creative, it will surely see great use in the creation of unique and radiant fireworks shows.

## Lumenstone Adjuvant

When equipped in The Chasm's Underground Mines, this precious crystal can provide illumination.

It has many similarities to the Glazed Sand Crystal that may only be found within The Chasm, but it stores even greater power within it.

## Bokuso Box

Use this to clear a certain area in Enkanomiya of the darkness' influence.
The name "Bokuso" is formed from "boku," meaning "to draw near to what is good," and "so," meaning "to shun that which is tainted."

## Arataki's Great and Glorious Drum

A musical instrument that can be used in performances.
A small drum that Itto gave you. He bought it from an outlander merchant, and while it does look quite normal, it is said to be a relic left behind by an ancient and powerful onmyouji who used it to drive out calamity and pray for blessings.
It would cost an ordinary person a large sum if they were to wish to possess this, but the price may be negotiated if one has some connection to the drum.
And wouldn't you know it? An 8,000,000 Mora treasure was eventually purchased for 80,000. What a steal for Itto, eh?

A stone that can be used in Sumeru to search for nearby Dendroculi.
A curious amulet of a similar nature to the Dendro Statues of The Seven. By the same token, it is drawn to Dendroculi.

A talisman that can help collect wood.
Talismans of this kind are often seen in the forests in Sumeru. They possess the ability to gather the power of grass and trees.
To prevent the erosion of the forest and, in darker times, to resist the invasion of vicious monsters, trees and vines would form impregnable shelters together. Those who held "the Boon of the Elder Tree" were recognized by the forest as its friends and thus gained unfettered access to walk amidst the forest under the guidance of streams and moonlight. But that is archaic lore from a long, long time ago.

## Treasure-Seeking Seelie

The "Treasure-Seeking Seelie" you got from Ulman. It doesn't look that energetic...

## Exquisite Kamera

A Kamera that Razi borrowed from Lord Sangemah Bay. It will come in handy when you take photos of beautiful scenery, look for inspiration in the wilderness, or wish to keep festive memories!
This Kamera is adorned with metal decorations and thus looks a lot more expensive than regular Kameras. Be careful with it!
According to the leasing agreement, it can only be used within Sumeru's borders.

## Banu's Wisdom

In some cosmological settings, this is a staff filled with mystical power. It can resonate with the Future Stars and show the way to them.
Of course, in some other settings, it might be an object kept in storage by an organization known as the Akademiya, and perhaps its recorded name might even be Ayesha's Chaos Prospector. There is a thin layer of dust over this object due to a long period of disuse.

## Fishing Line Stabilizer

A self-adaptive tension stabilizer that can be installed on a fishing rod to facilitate fishing. The device can automatically detect and record how hard different fish struggle. The more data it collects, the better the stabilizer works.

The device's prototype was the pointless invention of a Fontaine inventor that drew little interest for the longest time until the Fontaine Fishing Association discovered it and modified the product into the fishing line stabilizer used today. When the device first came out, it was most warmly received by the Association members, and now it has gradually been promoted in other regions.
It is an exceptionally hot commodity in the Snezhnayan market. Word has it that one of the Lord Harbingers is particularly fond of the product, which explains the hype.

## Vintage Lyre

Use this traditional instrument from Mondstadt to play songs. It may work wonders when played in the forests of Sumeru.
A vintage lyre borrowed from Amadhiah in Vimara Village.
Mondstadt has a long-standing tradition of poetry and song. Bards from there tend to address their instruments as "Friend" or "Partner." Thus, one of them trusting Amadhiah with the instrument was nothing less than a gesture of intimacy and trust.

## Jumpy Dumpty Party Popper

A party popper that, when used, unleashes streamers and confetti.
"Jumpy Dumpty is Klee's good friend and fish blasting companion! But if Klee brings Jumpy Dumpty to the festival, Master Jean will be angry... Don't you worry, though!

## "Bubbly Kamera"

When used, this useful gadget can save and store the scenery before it and add a special color tone to it.
A strange device of unknown origin. The photos it takes have a peculiar effect. Who would've thought that a machine with no water inside could produce photos with jovial bubbles in them that lend them a sense of fantasy?

## "Kusava"

Equip it to utilize the power of Aranara.
"Fatty fruit, bitter fruit."

## Wisdom Orb

A crucial item provided by the organizer of the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament. Use it to capture, accommodate, and command intelligent Fungi. Word has it that it was invented by a researcher named Kautilya. Only those who can wield this item skillfully are qualified to participate in the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament. That said, you cannot help but feel that some of this item's functions create a strong sense of déjà vu...

## Cloud Retainer's Damasked Device

Made from stacked paper, this lightweight device has the appearance of a bird, and fittingly, was given to you by Cloud Retainer.
While it may be called a "device," you cannot see any traditional mechanical components here — well, not from the outside, anyway.

## Wilderness Compass

A special compass obtained from the Adventurers' Guild. According to certain rumors, it might just offer you a sprinkle of extra luck...

A musical instrument that can be used in performances.
A drum with a clear sound and unique design. It has an exquisite exterior and features intricate craftsmanship. High-quality materials have been used in its construction, with a view toward sound quality during performances, intonation and long-term wear and tear.

## Sorush

Having formed a connection with one whom she trusts, Sorush now traverses the land blessed by Khvarena alongside her Yasnapati...

But who knows what it will be like when it grows up...

## Inscribed Mirror

A mirror-type gadget made by the Amurta researcher Lamiya. It can be linked to the animals' devices, which will reflect the animals' points of view in the mirror.

## Hydroculus Resonance Stone

A talisman that can be used in Fontaine to search for nearby Hydroculi.
A curious talisman that possesses similar properties to the Hydro Statues of The Seven. It seems to be able to detect the Elemental Flow of Hydroculi.
Oculi are by nature scattered pieces of power belonging to the Statues of The Seven. Returning them to the Statues is therefore the reasonable, right, and lawful thing to do.

## Hydro Treasure Compass

A compass that can be used in Fontaine to search for nearby treasure and relevant clues.
These chests scattered across Fontaine are not the lawful property of any individual or organization. In most circumstances, it is legal to claim the contents found within.

## Crystalfly Trap

A Crystalfly Trap, developed by a senior researcher named Fawitzki from Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering.
After being properly deployed and inserting the required materials, this device will start working and lure Crystalflies inside.
Fawitzki once led research on "Low-Temperature Lighting Devices," which required a large amount of Crystal Cores as research materials, which led to the development of the Crystalfly Trap.
However, the project was suspended for various reasons.
"We are here to commemorate the diligent Mr. Fawitzki. We sincerely hope that there are those who will carry on his research. The Institute will provide maximum support in any areas deemed appropriate."

## Wind-Powered Wind Generator

A wind generating device developed by Refait, senior researcher from Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering.
After being activated, this device can provide a strong lifting force for the Wind Glider user.
However, due to design limitations, the device requires utilizing significant wind power to activate. The wind energy required is approximately equal to that produced by the working Wind Glider.
"Umm... So you mean I can only activate this device when I'm already using the Wind Glider."
"But the only reason I even want to activate it is to give my Wind Glider a push!"

## Bresson's Special Kamera

A Kamera specially modified by Bresson. It was manufactured with the best materials available, and has excellent performance.

## Portable Aerodynamic Gelatinous Bubble Generator

A mechanism that can be used to create large amounts of colloid bubbles.

Givalois, a researcher from the Fontaine Research Institute, developed this prototype.
The original purpose was to create a large generator of gelatinous bubbles. Just as the project aimed to do, the bubbles so produced could carry some amount of water within them, and move or hover stably in the air, potentially achieving the aim of being able to quickly transport water resources.
However, as they were never able to find a material to make gelatinous bubbles of this type, the project stalled at the prototype stage.
But it is said the researcher Givalois's children loved this prototype bubble machine, so perhaps it would be possible to sell it as a toy?

"This machine is a product of Daddy's research, and it's called the Portable Aerodynamic Gelatinous Bubble Generator..."
"Bubbles! So pretty! Daddy, you're amazing!"

## Nightwind Horn

This exquisite horn is a Fontainian instrument that can be used in performances, and was a gift from Dvorak to you.
They say the tones of the horn are both rich and mellow as well as gentle, like a gentle evening breeze blowing among a thicket of trees. So, Fontainian composers often use horns to vividly bring the imagery of hunters and forests to life. Without a doubt, this instrument is eminently suited to a musical gala celebrating "life."

## "Fateometer"

A deceptively grandiose-looking card box that is actually quite simple. The number drawn seems to indicate a certain direction of fate, or perhaps the success or failure of a certain choice...
"As long as you believe in your bond with the cards, the numbers shown will show your fate." — Since Lyney said that, let's just tentatively take his word with a shaker of salt.

## Jocund Letters

Letter paper emanating a faint magical glow, and a finely crafted quill. With this in hand, elegant, ebullient words shall flow across the page of their own accord, writing detailed descriptions of certain objects' locations, and seemingly hinting at the location of treasure...

## Pyroculus Resonance Stone

A stone that can be used in Natlan to search for nearby Pyroculi.
During its crafting, adjustments were made to imbue it with characteristics resembling those of the Pyro Statues of The Seven, allowing one to sense the blazing power of the Pyroculi through it.
By sacrificing oneself, the Pyroculi can be returned to the statue, reuniting the scattered flames. Perhaps the Resonance Stone deems this sacrifice to be worth it.

## Pyro Treasure Compass

A compass that can be used in Natlan to search for nearby treasure and relevant clues.
Amidst the turmoil and strife that wrack the land, many treasures throughout the vast Nation of Pyro have gone unaccounted for, all trace of their whereabouts lost.

## Firstborn Firesprite

A tiny lifeform that emerged from a flame within a shell.
There is something quite endearing about its over-reliance on the shell it found protecting it at the moment it gained its sentience — perhaps it feels secure in this closed-up world. After all, when its eggshell is completely enclosed, it reigns supreme in its own little universe.
It is said that in ancient times, the Primal Fire burned with a similar life force.

## Kaboom Box

A mechanism that continually absorbs the force it receives.
Apparently, when the power within reaches bursting point, it will explode in a dazzling display of fireworks. But the amount of force needed to trigger this explosion seems to vary each time... So why not take turns attacking it with your friends? They say that whoever makes it go "kaboom" will have extraordinarily good luck for the rest of the day.

## Graffiti Kamera

A "Graffiti Alliance" Kamera provided by "Dopey Dazzler." Functionally, it isn't much different from a standard Kamera. However, it's said that it can capture and record specific scenes and objects, serving as a repository for inspiration and source material for graffiti artists...

## Paimon's Kamera

A convenient gadget that records and saves images when used, this one belongs to Paimon. Back when you bought it, you haggled with the seller for ages before finally scoring a bargain on this custom Kamera, which Paimon keeps with great care. You recall that the seller included a thick photo album along with the Kamera too, but you've barely seen her take it out. Just what kind of photos has she taken with that Kamera of hers?

## Artifact Transmuter

·Consume Sanctifying Elixir to generate Artifacts through the process of Definition, or consume Artifacts to obtain Sanctifying Elixir through the process of Extraction.
·During each cycle, there is a limit on both the amount of Sanctifying Elixir that can be extracted and the number of times that Artifacts of each Set can be defined.

Artifacts draw their power from stories. This explains how it is possible to attempt to create Artifacts through sacred writings. Legend tells of an instance where seventy sages independently produced identical translations of the same source text; and thus, the original text was considered to be sacred. A person has only to place their hand on this machine and the story behind the Artifact will naturally flow out of it.

## Repertoire of Myriad Melodies
