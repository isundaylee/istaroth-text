# An Opportunity for Rebirth


## Talk 1

Paimon: Just where is that thing? This is taking longer than Paimon thought...

## Talk 2

Paimon: Nothing in the water, either... Paimon thought it might have gotten blown in...
Paimon: We've looked everywhere, and still not seen anything that looks like a hat...
Traveler: Let's turn back. We can't scour the entire Fortress.
Paimon: Huh, that's a good idea! If he's just looking to cover his head, then it shouldn't matter what kind of hat he's wearing.
Paimon: Why don't we check out the Rag and Bone Shop? If memory serves, they've got all kinds of stuff in there!
Traveler: You sure get fired up quick when it comes to shopping...
Paimon: Hehe, you'll let Paimon pick out some other stuff too, right? If we're going to the shop anyway...
Paimon: Well, either way, let's go check it out first.
Traveler: ...I'm only paying for the hat.
Paimon: Huh? How did you know what Paimon was thinking!?
Paimon: *sigh* This is bad, nothing gets past you nowadays...
Traveler: We can just buy him a hat.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Eh? Paimon doesn't remember you being the boss...
Chamboduc: Hahaha, I'm just standing in for Mr. Alvard while he's off restocking the shop.
Chamboduc: #Now just wait a sec... a blond foreigner dressed all in white, accompanied by a glaze-covered flying chunk of gingerbread...
Chamboduc: You must be the legendary Traveler and their companion Paimon?
Paimon: #No! Uh... Well, you're... half right? Paimon's Traveler's treasured companion, sure, but she's not some flying chunk of gingerbread!
Chamboduc: Sorry, sorry! I just... I never thought I'd get the chance to see you with my own eyes, so I got a bit ahead of myself.
Chamboduc: I hope you'll find it in your magnanimous hearts to forgive my discourtesy. I'm just a nobody, after all.
Paimon: Ah, there's no need to put yourself down like that! Paimon's just venting...
Chamboduc: Well, your heroic actions at Erinnyes have long made their way to the Fortress of Meropide.
Chamboduc: We heard that you were personally received by His Grace when you made your way down here, you know. Ah, you were the envy of all...
Chamboduc: And you're now one of His Grace's favorite people, so of course, everyone wants to be introduced to you.
Traveler: Ah, so it's because of him...
Chamboduc: Haha, I figured you'd appreciate honesty over flattery.
Chamboduc: After all, I also only joined up here because I'd heard Mr. Alvard was a good friend of the Duke.
Chamboduc: And though I've only caught scant sight of His Grace since then, as fate would have it, I've become fast friends with Mr. Alvard himself.
Chamboduc: I mean, we've all got agendas, but rather than trying to force something to be true, it's often better to just go with the flow.
Paimon: Oh, so now, you're trying to kiss up to us.
Chamboduc: Well, I did mean it when I called you legends, and it is indeed an honor to meet the two of you.
Chamboduc: But enough of that — is there something you're looking for?
Traveler: A man's hat.
Chamboduc: No problem. Anything else?
Chamboduc: Feel free to check out anything you want. The Credit Coupon costs are on me.
Paimon: Wait, but that's... You don't have to be so nice!
Chamboduc: Well, it's not like I'm getting paid to watch this shop. Instead of Mora or coupons, Mr. Alvard usually just lets me take my pick of our goods.
Chamboduc: Life's been pretty good recently, so I might as well just waive your bill. Never hurts to make some friends...
Traveler: Well, if you put it that way...
Paimon: Alright... Paimon will take a look...
Black Screen Text: After a moment's hesitation, Paimon manages to pick out two snacks.
Chamboduc: Are you sure you don't want more? These opportunities don't come by every day, you know.
Paimon: It's alright! Two will do.
Traveler: I never thought you'd turn down a chance to freeload...
Paimon: Eh, it just doesn't feel the same if the owner's offering everything to you for free!
Paimon: But anyway, we don't need to get into that right now. We can discuss Paimonology later — that poor guy must still be waiting for us.
Paimon: Thank you so much! We'll be off, then.
Chamboduc: No problem, and thank you for your patronage! I'd appreciate it if you could put in a nice word for our establishment the next time you speak to His Grace.
Paimon: That's a real sneaky way of getting good reviews...
Traveler: And here I thought I had made it as a hero...

## Talk 4

Paimon: You can come out now! We've found your hat.
Faissolle: You did? Oh, Archons, you've just saved my life! Just one sec...
Faissolle: Hmm... Uhh...
Paimon: Wait, so you're not actually bald? You've got such a full head of hair, too!
Faissolle: *sigh* I mean, I told you that there had been a misunderstanding... This has nothing to do with my hair.
Faissolle: Wait, this isn't my hat...
Paimon: Well, we got you a new one! We tried really hard to look for your hat, but no dice.
Traveler: To be precise, someone else gave it to us...
Faissolle: Ah, I see... Thank you so much. I'm really grateful, but unfortunately, there's just something special about my hat...
Paimon: Does it have some kind of sentimental value?
Faissolle: Well, um...
Faissolle: Sorry, I can't... explain at the moment. Time's tight as well, so I suppose I'll keep looking for a while...
Wriothesley: If you're looking for a hat, I just picked one up over here. Is it yours?
Faissolle: Your Grace!?
Paimon: Oh, hey, Wriothesley! It's been a while.
Wriothesley: It's a slow day today, so I decided to go for a little stroll. Even if your work space isn't cramped, it's still good to get some air.
Wriothesley: I'll say, I'm not at all surprised to find the two of you here. You never could turn down someone's request for help.
Paimon: Hehe, it's what good adventurers do, after all!
Wriothesley: Is that so... Maybe I should consider asking the Adventurers' Guild to open a branch here.
Wriothesley: As I recall, these hats are very important to members of the Beret Society. Best you avoid misplacing it again, hmm?
Wriothesley: You might not have the same luck next time.
Faissolle: Understood. Th—Thank you so much, Your Grace.
Faissolle: Then... Then I'll be off. Umm... I—I'll get going now.
Paimon: What a strange guy... Why'd he care so much about his hat?
Paimon: Oh, and has he done something wrong? When he saw you, it was as if he'd seen a ghost.
Wriothesley: Oh, not at all. In fact, members of the Beret Society are model prisoners. They work hard and never get into trouble — they've saved me a lot of work, in fact.
Wriothesley: As for him... I'd guess he's just more of an introvert. It's not unusual for the more shy prisoners to freak out when I show up unannounced.
Paimon: Huh? Shy? There are prisoners who are... afraid to talk to people?
Wriothesley: Prisoners are still people, after all. There are as many crimes and motives as there are stars in the sky.
Wriothesley: The idea of the criminal as a selfish, heartless brute is just a stereotype. Such labels could never capture the complexity of even a single individual person.
Wriothesley: What kind of a person a prisoner may be, and why they have committed a crime — we'd never know these things if they don't share their story with us.
Paimon: Huh, you've got a point... Anyway, it's all good as long as it makes sense to you.
Traveler: What's this "Beret Society"?
Wriothesley: Although most of the societies here will just turn individual brawls into mass ones...
Wriothesley: The Beret Society does appear to be an exception in that it's instead trying to experiment with some novel and interesting things.
Wriothesley: If you have some time, why don't we grab something at the Coupon Cafeteria? It'll give us some time to catch up, too.
Wriothesley: And if you're still interested in the Berets after that, I can take you to their usual gathering place as well.
Paimon: Paimon's not the biggest fan of that cafeteria, but if we're gonna catch up...
Traveler: Let's go, then.
Wriothesley: Alright then, please follow me.
Traveler: There are people here who enjoy working?

## Talk 5

Wolsey: Welcome, Your Grace, and the Traveler. Would you like three orders of today's Welfare Meal?
Wolsey: Unfortunately, we weren't informed of your visit in advance, so we didn't prepare any Super Deluxe Welfare Meals today...
Wriothesley: I'll pass on the food, then. What about you?
Traveler: I'm not hungry.
Paimon: ...Then, Paimon will also pass. Paimon will save her stomach for something better!
Wriothesley: What a pity... It would seem that none of us can properly appreciate your skills, Wolsey.
Wolsey: Haha, then I must beg Your Grace to find me some more ingredients, so I can come up with some more Welfare Meal recipes.
Wolsey: If you're not in the mood to eat, I can get you some drinks. We just got some great shipments in from above.
Paimon: Yes please! Huh, Paimon didn't know you could get non-Welfare stuff at this place.
Wolsey: Haha, it's not for everyone. Think of it as a special treat for VIPs.
Paimon: Ooh, now that's what Paimon likes to hear! In that case, two bottles of the drink for Paimon, please!
Wolsey: Two bottles, coming right up!
Black Screen Text: After a while, Wolsey brings out the drinks for everyone.
Wriothesley: Our first meeting took place on short notice, and we were both swamped by everything that happened after, so there was no time for more casual chit-chat.
Wriothesley: I'm actually quite fond of stories, you know. Of course, the others have already told me a lot about your deeds in Fontaine, but I'd love to hear it straight from the source.
Paimon: Whoa, that'd be quite the long story...
Traveler: We fought tooth and nail for the sake of justice.
Wriothesley: Impressive. Not all who possess the courage to risk their life for their ideals also have the strength to make it out unscathed.
Wriothesley: Had you not possessed these remarkable qualities, I probably wouldn't have had the chance to make your acquaintance in the first place.
Paimon: Paimon gets the sense that you're trying to flatter us...
Paimon: That guy we talked to earlier was obviously trying to get us to put in a good word for him, but you're the Duke, right? Why would you need to get on our good side?
Wriothesley: Well, after all, you did help the Fortress and I maintain our autonomy.
Wriothesley: Is it so strange that I would want to give a few words of praise out of genuine admiration?
Traveler: Just a little bit.
Wriothesley: Ah, so this is a matter of trust. Which is unfortunate, since I don't have nearly as interesting of a story to offer about myself.
Wriothesley: I was convicted and sent here at an early age. I only became the top dog after spending a long time figuring out its inner workings.
Wriothesley: Power and control come in many forms, some fair and ethical, others less so. And since we're all sinners here, the victor calls the shots, no matter how they managed to get to the top.
Wriothesley: So, what do you think? Didn't put you much more at ease, now did it?
Paimon: Uh, kinda... You're really different from most of the people we've met so far...
Wriothesley: Haha, I'm perfectly aware of that, too. But even so, that doesn't make me think any less of you.
Wriothesley: I would very much like to maintain friendly relations with you two.
Traveler: That's how I feel as well.
Guelet: Your Grace, after following your instructions, we were able to find a box of undeclared contraband in the latest shipment of cargo.
Guelet: They were extremely well-hidden, and we've confirmed that the senders have been using this method to smuggle goods for a while. We're trying to trace the goods to their source.
Wriothesley: Got it. Leave the box here, and contact me immediately if you make any progress. You're dismissed.
Guelet: Yes, Your Grace.
Wriothesley: Sorry, I'd almost completely forgotten about this.
Paimon: She mentioned something about "contraband." Are they like, dangerous goods?
Wriothesley: Not necessarily. The term is just applied to things people want to bring in on the sly.
Wriothesley: Many people here are experts at pulling rabbits out of the most ordinary hats, so we have to examine everything carefully.
Wriothesley: Now, what do we have here... Hmm, it's more or less what I expected.
Paimon: Whoa, this is certainly a box of curiosities! Mora, snacks, yarn balls, ropes, mechanical parts, and even a gem!
Paimon: Wait, if you've confiscated this entire box, then does that mean... all of this belongs to you now?
Wriothesley: Yep. We can't just send them back up now, can we?
Paimon: #Whaaaat? But that's just insane profit! Traveler, why don't you become a Duke as well?
Traveler: And what about you, Paimon?
Paimon: Paimon will be your vault-keeper!
Wriothesley: Jokes aside, I didn't know you would be so interested in this box. How about this, then? You can pick anything you want from it. Consider it a gift from me.
Paimon: Really? You'll let Paimon pick anything?
Paimon: No takebacks! Paimon will have you know that she's got a real good eye for treasure!
Wriothesley: I never joke about things like this.
Paimon: Alright... Paimon's gonna have a look...
Paimon: Paimon wants... this one! This dark, sparkly gem — you just know it must be worth a ton of Mora!
Paimon: Umm... Uhh...
Paimon: Actually, never mind. Paimon doesn't want this gem anymore... Can Paimon pick something else instead?
Traveler: Paimon, what's wrong?
Paimon: There's something... weird about this gem. Paimon remembered a lot of bad things when she picked it up...
Paimon: Paimon couldn't even tune them out... It's as if the gem was just drawing them out of Paimon's brain. It was super spooky...
Wriothesley: Is that so? Let me give it a try.
Wriothesley: Uhh...
Wriothesley: Paimon's right. I, too, experienced some unpleasant flashbacks.
Traveler: Huh, let me try...
Wriothesley: Are you sure? I wouldn't exactly call it fun.
Traveler: I want to make sure I know exactly what you saw.
Wriothesley: Fair enough. Go ahead. I don't think it'll have a permanent effect.
Traveler: !!!
Paimon: #Are you okay, Traveler? You also saw something, right?
Traveler: Yeah, it's just as you said.
Wriothesley: I'll take this gem, then, and run a thorough investigation on its properties. Paimon, feel free to pick something else.
Paimon: Then... Actually, never mind. Paimon's gonna pass. Paimon was thinking about one of the snacks, but who knows if it'll also make Paimon sick...
Traveler: An astute decision.
Wriothesley: You do have a point. In that case, we should destroy the entire box and all of its contents.
Wriothesley: Seems like we're almost done with our drinks, too. Let's go check out the Society's gathering place, then.
Wriothesley: I can introduce you, and we can also continue our conversation while we're at it.
Paimon: Wait, are you this free every day or something?
Wriothesley: Just noticed? I wasn't exactly busy the first time we met, either.
Traveler: It doesn't hurt to be careful.
Traveler: I relived some... rather unforgettable memories.
Traveler: My constitution is a bit different from everyone else's.
Traveler: Are you feeling unwell?
Traveler: Let's get that title, then.
Wriothesley: It's only been a couple minutes since we agreed to continue friendly relations with each other, and you're already planning to overthrow me?
Traveler: I must thank you for your generosity, but...
Traveler: It's because you don't ever talk about yourself.
Traveler: I'm still trying to learn more about Fontaine.
Wriothesley: I see. Certainly, that'd fit your title as the Traveler.
Wriothesley: Seeing everything for yourself, recording everything to the best of your ability, and making lots of friends along the way... I'm sure that by the end of your journey, you'll possess an unmatched amount of perspectives and opportunities.
Traveler: To be honest, I really wasn't that involved with a lot of it...
Wriothesley: Haha, that's a bit too humble for you.
Wriothesley: Even the most unintentional action can catalyze new developments, and force many fates onto brand new paths.
Traveler: Super Deluxe or bust.
