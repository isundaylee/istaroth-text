Traveler: What are you hoping to achieve?
Xuanzhu: We are exploring the idea of cooperative engagement capability, separating units that receive intelligence from the units that launch the attack, which will give us an advantage...
Xuanzhu: Stationary ballistae and blast-launching mechanisms can be placed behind the ridge, out of the enemy's sight.
Xuanzhu: While attacking, some units won't aim at our targets directly, instead observing from a forward position and constantly reporting on target positions, firing based on information received.
Xuanzhu: As long as they keep correcting the trajectory, their projectiles will hit the target eventually.
Xuanzhu: This way, we can use distance as our defense, especially when our numbers are very limited.
Xuanzhu: This would be extremely effective against enemies whose attacks require direct line of sight, such as ruin mechanisms.
Xuanzhu: If our technology keeps advancing, we might be able to design mechanisms that can automatically correct the trajectory of arrows and shells to some extent.
Xuanzhu: Add on observers who will provide correction data, and our efficiency will increase a hundred, even a thousand times.
Xuanzhu: At that point, no number of ruin mechanisms will make any difference.
