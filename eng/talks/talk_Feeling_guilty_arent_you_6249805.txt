Traveler: Feeling guilty, aren't you?
Hautemontagne: Guilty? Nonsense. I'm here on official business! Look, they sent someone to the Institute because they needed someone to repair something. The Institute couldn't find anyone, and when they noticed I was twiddling my thumbs in Lumidouce Harbor, they ultimately decided to send me...
Hautemontagne: Right, I know what you're going to ask next. I was working on applying the Multi-Phase Tuner to hydrology, so I'm more on the application side.
Hautemontagne: My head hurts just looking at the theoretical discussions. We don't get a lot of opportunities to be in the spotlight, but I'm satisfied just looking at my results being implemented and in operation.
Hautemontagne: Oops, I accidentally said things that I shouldn't have. Please don't take what I said seriously.
