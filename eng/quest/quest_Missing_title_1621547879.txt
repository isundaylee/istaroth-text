# Missing title (1621547879)


## Talk 1

Leader: Hey, you! Yes, you! You gibbering imbecile! Why do you delay!? Even if we waste away, the treasure won't move itself, surely!
The Dude They Call "Idiot": Nay, sir! It's just that they are simply too heavy! We've been at this all day, yet there's still so much left...
Leader: Where, then, is the intrinsic merit in feeding that prodigious size of yours!? It's treasure, you brute, treasure! Of course it's heavy!
Leader: Besides, we "confiscated" all these treasures from those accursed barbarians, did we not?
Leader: Leaving such wealth in the hands of those insects who live like swine and mongrels would be a terrible waste!
The Dude They Call "Idiot": But Sir, don't you think we should've brought a few more ships if we wanted to haul all this back to Remuria?
Leader: What are you, slow? Imperial cargo ships are not to be used for such a thing!
The Dude They Call "Idiot": Well, why don't we destroy what we cannot carry? Better than having it fall into the hands of these savages!
Paimon: Uh, is it just Paimon, or have we heard this conversation before...?
Traveler: Sounds like when we first arrived in Petrichor...
Paimon: Yeah, those unlucky adventurers we drove off before were saying similar stuff.
Paimon: Feels like this round's worse than the last, too!
Paimon: Is it possible they were turned into golems after the boat they were on sank?
Paimon: That's so creepy!
Este: Are you of Legio IX? What are you doing here? Should you all not have been ordered to retreat to Fort Charybdis?
Leader: Hey, Este! Don't you dare ruin our fun, you hear?
Leader: These barbarians are less of a threat than dead fish anyway, so just let us have our fun messing about here for a while longer, would you?
Este: These treasures... *sigh* I don't know what orders your Harmost gave you...
Este: But did the Sebastos not order us to subdue these ignorant tribes and free them of fate's shackles? Those orders do not include such... clearly criminal deeds.
Leader: Hah? Surely you jest! The orders of our commander, mighty Dominus Boethius, were indeed to punish these savages harshly.
Leader: And besides, we have received no punishment. That means that both Phobos and the Sebastos, our Imperator, approve of our actions.
Leader: So what's all this talk about crimes... Are you trying to start trouble?
Este: But...
Paimon: There's another Este here? Well, aren't things getting weirder by the moment?
Osse: It appears that it is time to answer that question of yours.
Osse: The Este you met in town must be a descendant of Remurians. His ancestor must have followed me to join the new nation all those years ago, becoming an ordinary Fontainian.
Osse: As such, the "symphony" that has stolen these Fontainians' souls would not affect him. But in turn, the melody that records his ancestor's memories had nowhere to go, and so attached itself to that statue.
Paimon: So you mean that the Este here is Town-Este's ancestor, the real "Este the Quick-Witted"? What about the others?
Osse: Just wandering souls, lost in their memories. Let us go have a look.
Black Screen Text: You walk up together with Monsieur Os...
Paimon: Hello there, Este.
Este: Yes, hello. And who are you, exactly?
Este: You do not appear to be Remurians. Are you savages, then?
Traveler: I'm just a passing traveler.
Este: Well, this is a battlefield, and you put yourselves in great peril. You should leave this place, regardless of who you are.
Osse: Este, it is I. It has been a while.
Este: ...Skies above, it's you, Dominus Cassiodor! You so rarely appear in this form that I almost failed to recognize you.
Este: And as for these two... Are they your attendants?
Traveler: You can just take that to be so.
Este: Still, Dominus Cassiodor, what brings you here? Did the Sebastos not send you to... Damnation! I cannot remember! Am I in some dream?
Osse: That does seem to be the case.
Este: Haha! Surely you jest! The Sebastos must have assigned you some secret mission again, or else I am an ignoramus!
Osse: You guess correctly. Speaking of which, why are the legionnaires of Legio IX guarding those chains?
Este: The chains... You mean the treasure, yes? I believe them to be spoils of war.
Este: Though the Sebastos views war as naught but a sad necessity in fulfilling our grand aspirations and has long outlawed such brutal behaviors...
Este: You know as well as I that they have become commonplace nonetheless... We are on the path of darkness, though none perceive it.
Este: Dominus Cassiodor, what has happened? Phobos was meant to bring us happiness, but all I feel is a pain I cannot name...
Osse: I, too, am searching for the answer to that question. But it appears that we will have to deal with the problem at hand first.
Este: Indeed. Still, those are our legionnaires, so let us solve things peacefully, if we may.
Traveler: Actually, I'm his owner.
Este: ...Huh?
Paimon: #Hey, hey, Traveler, stop complicating things further! Don't worry, he was just joking, Este, so please, continue.
Traveler: Oh, I can get pretty savage.
Traveler: It's that bit with the "Treasure Hoarders" all over again.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Ahem, legionnaires of Legio IX!
Leader: Huh? Who are you? Este's little helpers?
Traveler: That we are.
Paimon: We're no ordinary helpers! Mighty are we who have come with Dominus Cassiodor, to attend and aid him.
Osse: (It seems you two have quite the penchant for acting.)
Leader: Dominus Cassiodor, you say... I heard that the Sebastos had sent him to Aremorica. Has he returned so soon?
Paimon: Well, the one next to us is, in fact...
Osse: ...
Paimon: Whâ€”Whatever the case, we have come to survey the frontline legions!
Leader: Right. I figured as much.
Leader: I mean, we haven't gone to Fort Charybdis with the main body of troops...
Leader: But we are the rearguard, so some final "cleanup" is well within our range of duties, eh?
Traveler: Is this also a command from Phobos?
Leader: Well... It should have guided our every move, but since coming here, there have been many times when we could not hear its melody.
Leader: As such, we've fallen back on Dominus Boethius's directives.
Traveler: Ah, that impudent fellow...
Leader: Who do you think you are!? How dare you impugn Dominus Boethius's name so flagrantly!
Leader: A Harmost as esteemed as he follows the directives of the Sebastos in all things. His word is as the word of Phobos itself.
Traveler: Phobos could have made a mistake as well.
Leader: Hah! Are you sure you're Remurian? Do you not know that Phobos was fashioned by the omnipotent Sebastos and the infallible oracle?
Traveler: Yet you are not receiving the melody.
Leader: Well, that is true enough. But in what can we place our trust, if not Phobos?
Leader: Surely it would not stand idly by, were we to diverge from the correct path?
Traveler: The Sebastos does not permit the harm of innocent people.
Leader: Innocent, you say... Yes, he did task us with helping these vulnerable humans before the war began.
Leader: But our actions have the tacit approval of Phobos. Could its decrees ever be in conflict with the sacred word of the Sebastos?
Traveler: We are special envoys of the Imperator, our Sebastos.
Paimon: What kinda rank is that... Well, that's not completely wrong. We're with Dominus Cassiodor.
Traveler: We are Cassiodor's retainers.
Paimon: That's right! Dominus Cassiodor's retainers, that's who we are!

## Talk 3

Leader: Very well... You speak true. We must reconsider our actions. I... In truth, I do not know how things came to this...
Leader: There's been a strange feeling in my heart since this war broke out.
Leader: We were meant to pursue freedom and happiness, but Phobos led us here instead, step by step...
Leader: Has something gone wrong? What could it be?
Leader: If you meet with the Sebastos upon your return, please apprise him of our circumstances and our doubts.
Leader: You'll be doing us a truly great favor.
Paimon: Don't worry, we will!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Leader: You... Come to think of it, you could be barbarians in disguise, attempting to deceive us! You are, aren't you!?
Leader: You damnable worms, I shall slay you where you stand!

### Additional Talk 2

Este: It seems that you've resolved our previous problem.
Este: I suppose that means you'll be rushing ahead toward your next goal, then?
Osse: Yes. I'll be counting on you to take care of this place, Este...
Osse: Also, remember that it is better to trust the wisdom of your heart rather than handing all judgment of right and wrong over to Phobos or any Harmost.
Osse: The Sebastos created Phobos to free us from our servitude to destiny, but the people's blind faith has led us into enslavement more frightful still.
Osse: In the future, you may encounter a similar choice once more. I hope you will make the right decision when the time comes.
Este: Dominus Cassiodor, why are you suddenly speaking of such things?
Este: Still, I shall keep your words in my heart. I, Este, shall uphold my own sense of justice.
Osse: That is good. Farewell, Este. I believe we shall meet again.

### Additional Talk 3

Este: Those are still our legionnaires, so let us try to resolve this peacefully, if we may.

### Additional Talk 4

Este: God King Above, thank you, Dominus Cassiodor. In any event, it seems that this issue has been resolved for now.

### Additional Talk 5

Leader: Phobos is a perfect creation. I counsel you, as a Remurian, to not doubt its directives.
Traveler: Perfect? Nothing is truly perfect.
Leader: What are we doing now, debating sophistry? Take it up with those musical erudites in the capital. A soldier's duty is to obey. Complex matters are not my strong suit...
Traveler: Phobos's silence signifies rejection.
Leader: Yes... That is possible. How did I not consider that? Could our rash actions have caused Phobos to cease guiding us?
Leader: If so... Then it bodes very ill...
