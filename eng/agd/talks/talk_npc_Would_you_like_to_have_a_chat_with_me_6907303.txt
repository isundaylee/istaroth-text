# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Nahida: Sure, but instead of diving into story time, let's talk about what's troubling you.
Nahida: I'm sure you're wondering how I knew.
Nahida: Well, your troubles are written on your face, silly! I'm always observing you, you know.
Nahida: You look as miserable as a Lavender Melon that's been struck by lightning.
Traveler: I feel like nothing's been going my way lately...
Nahida: Don't lose heart. Sometimes you might feel like you're the unluckiest person in the world, but for all you know, it could also just be an unfortunate situation.
Traveler: What's the difference?
Nahida: Well, to use an analogy... Let's say a Rishboland Tiger ate a fox and got diarrhea.
Nahida: You can't know for sure whether the diarrhea was caused by eating the fox or by something inside the fox's stomach. Does that make sense?
Traveler: Barely.
Nahida: If Rishboland Tigers stopped eating foxes out of fear of diarrhea, they would have become extinct a long time ago.
Nahida: As long as the Rishboland Tiger keeps eating foxes, and as long as we keep living our lives, we'll experience all kinds of different situations. Fortunate, unfortunate, and everything in between.
Nahida: There, there. You're doing great. Have a headpat.
Traveler: I get it.
Traveler: Can you whip out one of your analogies?
Nahida: Hmm... Well, let's say a Rishboland Tiger ate a fox and got diarrhea.
