# Another Day as an Outrider!


## Talk 1

Amber: #Hi Paimon, hi {NICKNAME}! What can I do for you?
Paimon: Hi Amber~
Traveler: Amber, something has come up...
Paimon: Amber, do you know a wolf boy from Wolvendom?
Amber: Who?
Paimon: He said you guys hit it off like a mountain on fire...
Amber: What on earth are you talking about?
Paimon: Strange... He said he would wait for you at your regular spot. Did you lose your memory or something?
Amber: My memory is fine. But you've been eating magic matsutake again, haven't you Paimon?
Amber: I have no idea what you're talking about.
Paimon: Magic matsutake... Remind me what color they are?
Amber: Purple.
Paimon: ...Paimon may have had a couple the other day.
Paimon: But that's not the point! Paimon's not loopy!
Paimon: Do you really not know that boy that lives with the wolves?
Amber: I. don't. know. what. you're. talking. about.
Amber: But on the subject of wolves, I've been investigating something recently.
Amber: In the past, the wolves never dared venture outside of Wolvendom. But now they're getting braver.
Amber: I heard they attacked a cart fleet near Drunkard Gorge.
Amber: If you have time, could you come and check out the situation with me?
Traveler: Sure.
Amber: Awesome! I knew I could count on you, let's go.
Traveler: Let's get to it.
Traveler: Hey Amber, what's up?
Amber: Hi... Looks like you've got a bit of time on your hands.
Paimon: Uh-oh, here it comes...
Amber: I've been rushed off my feet recently. An Outrider's duties never end, so... Wanna help?
Paimon: Told you so!
Traveler: Sure.
Amber: Recently, wolves have been attacking the carts at Drunkard Gorge.
Amber: As you know, wolves are dangerous, but they do have their own rules.
Amber: Mondstadt's wolves don't normally venture outside of the Brightcrown Mountains and Wolvendom.
Paimon: Yes, Paimon heard someone say that those areas do have their own set of rules, even though they are wild and untouched by humans.
Amber: That's right. So for wolves to be showing up around Drunkard Gorge is very unusual.
Paimon: Speaking of wolves, do you happen to know a wolf boy from Wolvendom?
Amber: Who? I've never heard of anyone like that around Mondstadt.
Paimon: Um... What?
Paimon: "The red one, burny girl..." That ain't you?
Amber: Burny...? What are you talking about?
Amber: Anyway, I'm off to Drunkard Gorge to investigate.
Amber: Come with me!
Traveler: What's the issue?

## Talk 2

Amber: Look, up ahead! Something's happening.
Paimon: That ain't no wolf pack... looks like it's the hilichurls attacking the carts after all.
Amber: Huh. Not such a mystery after all.
Amber: Enough talk. Let's go help out!

## Talk 3

Siegfria: Bless you!
Paimon: Piece of cake!
Amber: So, the hilichurls have been starting to flex their muscles on the back of the wolf scare.
Siegfria: That's right. But I must say, if you think the Hilichurls are a nasty lot, the wolves are even worse.
Siegfria: They... they attacked Springvale this morning.
Amber: Springvale!? That's crazy!
Siegfria: It's unheard of.
Siegfria: I thought I would take my chances on the road after the wolves had their fun... I never thought the hilichurls would show up too.
Amber: We should head there soon and see how bad the situation is.
Amber: But first things first, you should assess the damage to your cart. Does it still work?
Siegfria: I'll take a look.

## Talk 4

Amber: Quick, let's go help!
