Gorou: Her Excellency once cautioned me against getting lost in the heat of the battle. She said that while being fierce, courageous, and doggedly determined are good traits to have when you're leading an army, if you always throw yourself into the fray without keeping a level head, there will come a day when it backfires on you.
Gorou: So I think that whenever there's a break between battles, it's important to take a chance to calm down and collect your thoughts.
Gorou: You have to stand as firm as a mountain and burn as bright as a raging fire. That's the gold standard for any army, don't you think?

Gorou: On the battlefield, even the strongest warriors can be captured if they get isolated, and even the weakest soldiers can conquer the enemy if they stay united.
Gorou: There's only so much one person can accomplish on their own. So my view is that the strength of the whole group is what matters if you want to build an unstoppable army.
Gorou: Likewise, even the fiercest enemy soldier is nothing to be feared. As long as we work together as a team and make effective use of our resources, victory will be ours!

Gorou: Did I ever mention? I have a column in That's Life magazine, where I help readers with their problems.
Gorou: I only get to communicate with them in writing. But even though I never meet them face-to-face, I know that the camaraderie between us is real.
Gorou: Whatever I encounter in this domain, it's all valuable experience! I'm sure it'll come in handy one day and allow me to help more people.
