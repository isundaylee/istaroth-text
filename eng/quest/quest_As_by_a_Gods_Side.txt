# As by a God's Side


## Talk 1

Paimon: Dehya~! We're here!
Dehya: It's about time! Didn't you say our part of the plan is the most important of all? Tsk, and here you come rolling in late.
Dehya: In the time it took you to get here, I already did five laps around the place, downed seven drinks, and even did some clothes shopping.
Paimon: Uh, sorry... We didn't mean to keep you waiting...
Dehya: Heh, I just wanted to fix your attitude and rub it in a little. After all, you took your sweet time getting here, and we've got important stuff to take care of.
Traveler: Sorry, the situation was a bit tricky.
Dehya: ...Haha, I just like seeing that serious look on your face. Alright, I'll stop.
Dehya: All joking aside, I'm glad you're here. Let's get moving and take care of this as soon as possible.
Paimon: Uh, but where should we start?
Dehya: Our responsibility is to get a status update on the Fatui Harbinger known as The Doctor. We need to make sure he won't get in our way when we rescue Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Dehya: Dealing with an institution that controls all of Sumeru is already hard enough... If The Doctor were to crash the party, it would be next to impossible for us to achieve our goals.
Paimon: Yeah, we sure don't want him showing up... Ugh, he really gives Paimon the creeps!
Dehya: Right, hearing his name just reminds me of those stuffy old geezers in the Akademiya. I'd rather not have to deal with someone like that.
Traveler: So, what should we do?
Dehya: According to the plan, we should first go to Pardis Dhyai, and ask for Forest Watcher Tighnari.
Dehya: If Alhaitham and Cyno's sources are solid, then we can be sure that Tighnari still has the Akademiya's trust.
Dehya: So, we'll find Tighnari, and convince him to get us the latest intel on The Doctor. Then, depending on what we learn, we'll make any necessary adjustments to our plan.
Dehya: The sages have placed spies everywhere on the other side of the Wall. I'll follow you as a bodyguard.
Traveler: I didn't expect you to become my bodyguard.
Dehya: Haha, you should be honored. I don't offer my services to just anyone, you know.
Paimon: But Paimon thought mercenaries would do anything for Mora!
Dehya: That's certainly true, but when multiple employers are vying for your services, you should always go with the best offer. Hmm, let's see. If I were to charge you a bill... I guess I can apply a discount.
Paimon: H—How much Mora do you want? Paimon's not sure we can afford it...
Dehya: Hmm, how much do I want...? Hey, how about paying me with a smile, whaddya say?
Traveler: ...Huh?
Dehya: I haven't seen you smiling much recently. If you ask me, someone like you must look lovely when they smile.
Dehya: Come on, give me a smile so that I can be less worried.
Traveler: ...Thank you, Dehya.
Dehya: Looking good! I hope this pretty smile will become our lucky charm.
Dehya: There are many kinds of smiles, but only a truly joyous one can bring blessings to others. Let's consider this smile a down payment for our future victory.
Dehya: Let's go! It's time to pay a visit to Pardis Dhyai.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Tighnari!
Tighnari: #Ah, {NICKNAME}, Paimon, and you are...?
Traveler: Long time no see!
Dehya: Hey there...
Paimon: This is our friend, Dehya. She's an Eremite mercenary!
Tighnari: A mercenary... Hmm, you must have some big news for me.
Traveler: Tighnari, we want to ask you about something.
Paimon: It's something really important! Please help us out.
Tighnari: Alright, then follow me.
Tighnari: This place is better. We won't be disturbed by any passerby.
Tighnari: Okay, what is this important thing you want to ask me?
Traveler: Have you ever met The Doctor?
Traveler: I want to know where he is.
Tighnari: The Doctor, hmm...
Paimon: He's that strange-looking Fatui Harbinger with a mask! Paimon thinks he has blue hair.
Tighnari: Yes, I know him.
Tighnari: Actually, he left Pardis Dhyai just a little while ago.
Dehya: He left already?
Tighnari: Yeah, he came looking for me.
Dehya: Can I ask what it was about?
Dehya: Sorry to ask you like this after having just met, but your answer is very important to us.
Dehya: For now, all we can share with you is that... your friend Cyno is working with us.
Tighnari: Cyno, you say?
Tighnari: ...
Tighnari: ...I see, so that's why he hasn't been at the Akademiya.
Tighnari: Okay, I will answer your questions and will assist you any way I can. You don't have to tell me everything that's happened.
Dehya: Hahaha, Cyno's name really does work wonders. You're not even a little worried that we might've made it all up?
Tighnari: #Despite having just met you, I can sense that you're the serious type. Between you, {NICKNAME}, and Cyno, none of you strike me as the type that would conspire to deceive me.
Tighnari: You don't need to tell me anything you don't want to. I'll also get straight to the point.
Tighnari: The Harbinger you mentioned came to me because he wanted to take the scholar Haypasia away with him.
Paimon: Haypasia!? Why would he want her?
Traveler: What is he after?
Dehya: And what do you mean by "take away"? Is he planning to leave Sumeru?
Tighnari: Yes, he told me his return to Snezhnaya is imminent.
Tighnari: Hmph... so you mean, you're leaving this place soon?
The Doctor: Indeed. Otherwise, we could have perhaps talked a little more.
The Doctor: I was just about to set out when I remembered something important. To that end, I made a final trip to Pardis Dhyai.
The Doctor: Let me ask... have you been taking care of a scholar by the name of Haypasia?
Tighnari: Your sources are accurate, no doubt because you have recruited many informants, but you are right, Haypasia has indeed been receiving treatment from me.
The Doctor: Forgive me for asking, but how's the treatment coming along?
Tighnari: Given the way you're asking, I assume you have something to say?
The Doctor: Since you asked, I'll be frank: I would like to take Haypasia to Snezhnaya.
Tighnari: ...
Tighnari: It's incredibly difficult to transfer a patient. As a scholar yourself, shouldn't you at least be aware of this?
The Doctor: Oh? I can't believe your utter lack of faith in me, to the point of even questioning my general level of knowledge. How unbefitting.
Tighnari: Well, you're the only one who's ever made such a request.
The Doctor: I have my ways of keeping her safe during the journey. In addition, I can also promise that under my care, Haypasia will receive the most advanced and effective treatment.
The Doctor: I will personally supervise her treatment and see to her recovery. Would that be agreeable to you?
Tighnari: Haypasia was born in Sumeru, and remains a scholar of the Akademiya. Her situation has not become dire enough to necessitate her transfer to another nation.
Tighnari: Transporting her to Snezhnaya is risky, and the potential benefits are unknown. As the person currently responsible for her treatment, I cannot possibly sign off on this transfer.
Tighnari: Your suggestion is rude and reckless. I'll pass.
Tighnari: I don't know much about The Doctor. But after talking with him, I realized that just like many other scholars, he possesses an aura of arrogance that I've come to detest.
Tighnari: It's not so much that he's looking down on others, but more that he's confident in himself and his abilities to a point of near insanity.
Tighnari: I would never refer a patient to someone like him.
Traveler: Do you think he'll just give up on her?
Tighnari: I prepared myself for a protracted battle of wits, and was really surprised to see him just give up on the topic. Still, his reaction really concerned me...
The Doctor: ...Hehe.
The Doctor: I see, I see. Of course, your opinion makes perfect sense.
The Doctor: Hehe... You're still young, but already quite stubborn. I must say, you are not like what I had expected...
Tighnari: ...
The Doctor: Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't just let you off the hook like this, but unfortunately, I'm in a hurry today — what with Her Most Noble Majesty, the Tsaritsa, calling for our return.
The Doctor: Luckily, there is still some time left for me to take care of everything before I leave.
The Doctor: It's just as the Akademiya said — you're a responsible and gifted scholar. Sadly, even with all of that, you're still lacking a bit of shrewdness.
The Doctor: And that's also why people like you can never realize that sooner or later, everyone must pay the price for what they've learned.
Paimon: Uh... Paimon can't help but feel like he's hinting at something unpleasant...
Tighnari: He asked a question, yet didn't care for my answer. Perhaps I'm nothing but a talking rock in his eyes.
Tighnari: He never came off as malicious, but an utter lack of compassion permeated throughout our conversation. From his tone, I can sense that he's always looked down on others.
Dehya: ...
Traveler: I can't believe he is actually leaving Sumeru...
Dehya: I can barely believe it myself. But if that's true, the situation will be in our favor.
Tighnari: I don't think I missed any details. Frankly speaking, I don't want you to do anything too risky. Now that you know a little more, it should be easier for you to stay safe.
Traveler: Thank you for sharing the information with us, Tighnari.
Dehya: Sorry we can't tell you everything. We appreciate that you helped us anyway. I won't forget your kindness.
Tighnari: It's okay, I have an obligation to do so. To be perfectly honest... all of this may have started because of me.
Tighnari: Recently, my master wrote several letters to me, asking me to return to the Akademiya and assist him with his research.
Cyno: Hasn't he already asked you several times before?
Tighnari: Yes, but there's something off about this most recent batch of letters. The handwriting and tone are both familiar, but some details have been omitted...
Tighnari: My master will occasionally leave a few dots on the back of the letter. One dot means that he wrote the letter on a sunny day, and three dots stand for a rainy day.
Tighnari: This has been a habit of his for many years. But I didn't find any dots in his recent letters. I believe... something may have happened to him.
Cyno: I get it. Since you are always at Gandharva Ville, you would like me — someone already working at the Akademiya — to investigate this matter, right?
Tighnari: I'd like to ask you to do that for me, if you can keep yourself safe. Please withdraw immediately at the first hint of danger.
Cyno: I can do that, but I have a feeling it won't be that simple.
Cyno: The Akademiya has been working on a big project. I'm not quite sure what it is, but your master might be involved with it.
Tighnari: ...
Cyno: If the higher-ups really are hiding something, then it will be difficult to remove myself from the situation once the investigation starts.
Cyno: If the situation becomes critical, I'll leave the Akademiya. If you don't see me there for an extended period, that's your cue.
Tighnari: Alright, we've got a plan. I'll stay at Gandharva Ville to support you.
Cyno: If that scenario comes to pass, you must be extra vigilant, and be wary of any messages or direct requests from the Akademiya.
Tighnari: I must say, I didn't expect a warning like this from the General Mahamatra.
Cyno: Being loyal to the Akademiya doesn't mean blindly doing whatever the sages say. I know what I'm doing.
Cyno: On that note, aren't you also being quite distrustful of your alma mater?
Tighnari: The Akademiya, yes. But my master is a man of integrity. Even when I was a student, I was worried that he'd get in trouble for sticking to his beliefs.
Tighnari: I suppose he's lucky to have lasted so long... but in the end, it still caught up to him.
Dehya: I see... so you noticed something was up with the Akademiya from the very beginning.
Tighnari: This may well be how Cyno became involved in all of this. In which case, I must keep my promise, and help you however I can.
Tighnari: Also, if you run into Cyno again, please help me pass on a message to him: "Trust your own senses and experiences."
Tighnari: I think this may be something he needs to hear right now.
Paimon: Okay, we'll find a chance to tell him!
Tighnari: Thanks.
Dehya: Right, now let's go hunt down this Harbinger...
Dehya: Oh, by the way, which way did The Doctor go when he left Pardis Dhyai?
Tighnari: That way.
Dehya: Gotcha, thanks so much. We'll be on our way.
Traveler: See you later!

## Talk 3

Dehya: According to Tighnari, The Doctor is leaving Sumeru soon. I want to check if The Doctor was actually telling the truth.
Dehya: He also said that he will "take care of everything" before he leaves. What did he mean by that? We need to be extra careful when dealing with a person like him.
Dehya: Just to be safe, let's chase him and see what we find.
Paimon: But we have no idea where he went. How can we start chasing him?
Dehya: We'll do it the mercenary way. I'll find leads as we go, all you have to do is just follow me.

## Talk 4

Tighnari: You can just focus on your plan. Leave Haypasia to me.
Tighnari: My wound isn't going to get in the way... Argh! Okay... Guess I'll sit still for a little while longer.

## Talk 5

Dehya: We can stop here. I think I know where The Doctor went.
Dehya: To the south of here is Port Ormos, which seems to be where they're headed.
Paimon: Port Ormos... they're going to leave by boat?
Dehya: That's right. Let's go to the port and have a look for ourselves.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Look, Fatui soldiers!
Paimon: Thanks to Dehya's tracking skills, seems we've found the right place!
Dehya: Shh, don't draw their attention.
Dehya: The port is crawling with Fatui soldiers...
Paimon: Let's keep going and see what we can find!

## Talk 7

Tighnari: "Sooner or later, everyone must pay the price for what they've learned"... Hmph, what an arrogant statement.
Tighnari: Oh, don't mind me, I was just thinking about his words. Be sure to take extra care of yourselves.

## Talk 8

Dehya: This place will do. We can hide here while we keep an eye on the boat.
Traveler: (So The Doctor didn't lie about leaving Sumeru... But, could it really be that simple?)
Traveler: Are we sure he's not planning something...?
Dehya: ...!?
Paimon: Uh oh!
Traveler: What's the matter?
Paimon: He... he saw us...
Traveler: ...!
Dehya: Huh, is he waving at us?
The Doctor: It's time to say goodbye.
Dehya: Wait, is he the only person on the boat?
Paimon: Huh? You mean there's nobody with him?
Dehya: ...And where are all the soldiers we saw in the port just now?
Paimon: They were all here just a few minutes ago, but now, they've vanished...
Dehya: So this was a trap...
Traveler: But there's nobody around us.
Dehya: Wait, don't tell me that...
The Doctor: "Luckily, there is still time left for me to take care of everything before I leave."
Black Screen Text: The boat carrying The Doctor sails out of the harbor...
Dehya: Oh no...
Traveler: Uh-oh!
Dehya: They might be after Haypasia. Let's get back to Pardis Dhyai!
Paimon: Huh? What do you mean?
Traveler: I just remembered...
Traveler: Haypasia once connected her consciousness to The Balladeer...
Dehya: I'm afraid that she's seen something that she wasn't supposed to see. If I were the Fatui, I would also try to take her away. And if I couldn't...
Paimon: Oh no! Are you saying they're going to kill her!?
Dehya: Let's go!

## Talk 9

Tighnari: Pardis Dhyai is not a place you Fatui can just show up and do as you please.
Fatui Sergeant: I believe we've already made ourselves quite clear. Our superior gave us permission to search for and collect medicinal herbs in Pardis Dhyai for research purposes.
Tighnari: But you've been in Sumeru for some time already. I find it coincidental that you chose to only come here today.
Fatui Sergeant: Even the Grand Sage himself may not have the right to question our research, much less an ordinary scholar like yourself.
Fatui Sergeant: I've done my duty to inform you. Don't make things difficult for yourself.
Tighnari: It would seem that my words have fallen on deaf ears.
Tighnari: You can keep trying to deny it, but coming to Pardis Dhyai now? I'm pretty sure you're not just looking for herbs.
Fatui Sergeant: With all due respect, your baseless speculations will only lead to unnecessary trouble.
Tighnari: Well, you only have your Harbinger to blame. He knows nothing about keeping a low profile.
Tighnari: I may be staying at Pardis Dhyai as a scholar, but that doesn't mean I'm no longer a Forest Watcher.
Tighnari: It is still my duty to protect the peace and safety of the scholars who have contributed so much to Sumeru.
Fatui Sergeant: Then it seems our conversation has hit an impasse.
Tighnari: No one will lay a hand on you, Haypasia... Not on my watch!

## Talk 10

Tighnari: #We're not getting anywhere... {NICKNAME}, Paimon, please go to Haypasia. We need to make sure they don't try to sneak around and attack from behind.
Paimon: Got it!
Paimon: Haypasia's still here. Doesn't look like anyone's broken in...
Traveler: ...
Traveler: (She appears unharmed, but why is she so still?)
Traveler: (Phew, she's just sleeping.)
Paimon: Well, how is she?
Traveler: Everything's fine. She's sound asleep.
Paimon: Oh, that's good...
The Balladeer: So, you think this is over.
Traveler: (That voice...)
Traveler: The Balladeer!?
Paimon: What! The Balladeer is here!?
The Balladeer: Haha, I've missed that look of abject horror. You've given me that look every time we meet.
Paimon: But uh, where is he?
Traveler: (Paimon can't see him! So is he... a spirit? A ghost? Wait...)
Traveler: (Is it because I made physical contact with Haypasia? Is The Balladeer in her consciousness?)
The Balladeer: I can hear all of your thoughts, you know.
The Balladeer: Don't you remember? I already "saw" you the first time you came to Pardis Dhyai and made contact with Haypasia.
Traveler: What did you do to Haypasia?
The Balladeer: I didn't need to do anything. It is her honor to be able to connect her consciousness with me.
Paimon: Uh, who are you talking to? ...It can't be The Balladeer, right? Hehe, that's impossible...
The Balladeer: I know you must be curious. I might as well tell you that I decided to enter Haypasia's consciousness the moment I sensed your touch.
Traveler: But why?
The Balladeer: I wanted to observe you on a fool's errand.
Paimon: #Hey, {NICKNAME}! Wh—What are you doing...
Traveler: Paimon, please stay quiet for now...
The Balladeer: My deification is nearly complete. All that's left now are just some final details.
The Balladeer: Do you understand? Even if you manage to rescue Lesser Lord Kusanali, it will be impossible for you to defeat a bona fide god like me.
The Balladeer: Is it wise to force that childlike god into a divine battle against me?
Traveler: (The Akademiya acted even faster than we thought...)
The Balladeer: Scholars consider the God of Wisdom to be the sum total of their faith. It's how they can justify reverence for a god as they construct it.
The Balladeer: But this also shows that humanity's worship of gods is a combination of blasphemy and exaltation. It's truly laughable.
Traveler: (If you can hear my thoughts, I want to ask you a question.)
The Balladeer: Yes, what is it?
Traveler: (You're acting more friendly than usual, or am I mistaken?)
The Balladeer: Yeah, I'm in a good mood, which is why I'm talking to you like this.
Traveler: (...But, are you really okay with all this?)
The Balladeer: What do you mean?
Traveler: (The Akademiya plans to infuse your consciousness with Divine Knowledge Capsules... this is extremely risky.)
Traveler: (Even if the Akademiya's theories are correct, and you manage to gain the wisdom of a god...)
Traveler: (You would probably no longer remain yourself. You will become the new "Greater Lord Rukkhadevata" for the Akademiya.)
Traveler: (Even if it means losing yourself, would you still want to become a god?)
The Balladeer: Hmph, those words almost make you sound like a friend who actually cares.
The Balladeer: But you're wrong. I'm different from all of you.
The Balladeer: I was born to become a god. My entire life up until this point has just been a meaningless routine.
The Balladeer: Just think about a sheet of paper... By itself, it holds no meaning. The content recorded on it is what gives it value.
The Balladeer: All "I" had recorded down before were some painful memories and boring human feelings. Such senseless drivel should have been erased a long time ago.
The Balladeer: Indeed, to me, the sight of you fools and your futile struggles is far more amusing. Tell me, just what has this world done for you to protect it with such zest and conviction?
Traveler: ...You wouldn't understand.
The Balladeer: I'm connected to your consciousness, so I can hear what you're thinking and sense the depth of your determination.
The Balladeer: This is a good conversation we're having, so here's a word of advice... Let go of your misguided guardian complex. You know nothing about the truth.
The Balladeer: It'll be for your own good, as well as everyone else's. Humans are a species that can only find bliss in ignorance.
Traveler: (...If that's truly what you believe, why did you keep your connection with Haypasia? Surely, with the power you've come to possess, you can cut her off with just a thought.)
The Balladeer: Ah, you've seen my affection for her. If you were in my position, I think you'd feel the same way.
The Balladeer: She peered into my consciousness and saw my past. Someone like that is qualified to become my first follower.
The Balladeer: All gods need followers, so Haypasia has been chosen. Her appearance heralds my imminent arrival at the throne of divinity, while her worship shall become my glory.
Traveler: (...Is that so?)
The Balladeer: You're doubting me again? No matter. Soon, you'll know what kind of authority you're challenging.
Traveler: (If you truly cherish your follower, you should protect her from harm.)
The Balladeer: Who wants to hurt my devout follower?
Traveler: (It seems that The Doctor does not wish for her to stay in Sumeru and continue receiving treatment here. Isn't that a little suspicious?)
The Balladeer: The Doctor wants to hurt my first follower?
Traveler: (...Doesn't that make you mad?)
The Balladeer: Hehehe...
The Balladeer: ...Hahahaha. How very amusing. Has anyone ever told you that you're not good at sowing discord?
The Balladeer: The Doctor has never known his place. Even now, the puny human thinks himself capable of interfering in the business of the new god.
The Balladeer: You're still too naive if you think a few words will be enough to convince me to destroy The Doctor, but I'm willing to give you a gift, just like my expression of affection towards Haypasia...
The Balladeer: It is an honor for you to be able to stand here and speak with me. As my listener, you will be rewarded.
Traveler: (That look on your face... What are you planning?)
The Balladeer: Both good things and bad things can be called gifts. After all, gods have never needed to be reasonable.
Paimon: Waaah!? Paimon hears thunder!
Traveler: Thunder!? Could it be The Balladeer?
Paimon: That person Paimon couldn't see was The Balladeer? He sure chatted with you for a while!
Traveler: I didn't expect that, either...
Paimon: Uh? Where is the storm headed!?
Traveler: It can't be... Is The Balladeer using the Gnosis to change the weather?
Paimon: That means anyone outside is in danger! Let's go, Tighnari and Dehya still must be fighting!
Traveler: He's become... milder, but somehow, even more deranged.

## Talk 11

Paimon: Oh, have the Fatui retreated?
Traveler: Tighnari and Dehya are over there!
Paimon: Hey! What happened to you!?
Dehya: He's hurt.
Tighnari: I'm fine... Ugh!
Dehya: Don't move. I've seen Eremites get struck by lightning before. You need to rest.
Paimon: Struck by lightning!?
Dehya: We were fighting, and just as things started looking grim, the weather suddenly became extremely strange. Lightning started attacking everyone, almost as if it were alive.
Dehya: Luckily, there were only two of us, and both of us were nimble enough to dodge most of the strikes. There were a lot of Fatui, though, and they were being torn to shreds by the bolts of lightning.
Tighnari: With that, all the Fatui soldiers were forced to retreat...
Traveler: Your wound...
Tighnari: It's alright.
Tighnari: My wound aside, you look like... you've seen something unpleasant. Is Haypasia alright?
Traveler: She's okay for now, but I want to tell you something.
Tighnari: Ugh...!
Dehya: Hey! Didn't I tell you not to move?
Tighnari: Just in case... Ugh! Let's... go to Haypasia's place, and talk about things there.
Traveler: ...I'm really sorry.
Tighnari: Why are you sorry?
Traveler: I might have triggered the thunder and lightning...
Tighnari: Huh... It's alright, I'm sure you also never expected this to happen. Don't blame yourself.

## Talk 12

Tighnari: ...
Tighnari: Thank goodness, she's fine.
Paimon: Hey, how about taking care of yourself first?
Tighnari: I understand my condition... *grimace* The wound is not fatal. I'll be alright.
Paimon: Ugh, the more you understand medicine, the worse of a patient you become...
Dehya: I know. They always think they can push through the pain.
Tighnari: Ugh... agh!
Paimon: Oh, he sat down!
Tighnari: #Let me rest for a bit... *exhale* Sorry, {NICKNAME}, now you may start.
Black Screen Text: You recount everything from "meeting" The Doctor at Port Ormos to your encounter with The Balladeer while checking up on Haypasia.
Paimon: So that's what you were talking to The Balladeer about? Paimon can't believe what he's thinking...
Tighnari: The Akademiya's... god creation plan... How ridiculous.
Dehya: That sounds, uh... ambitious, I guess? Anyway, this is all way beyond me.
Dehya: As long as I can enjoy every day with a drink in my hand, tasty food in my stomach, and a good night's rest, that's enough. I'll only work when I have to.
Dehya: Ahaha, I must be the least ambitious person who's ever set foot in Pardis Dhyai.
Tighnari: Don't say that. I haven't even thanked you for your help back there.
Dehya: Don't mention it.
Dehya: Well, if nothing else, all this proves that The Doctor really did have some urgent matter to attend to, and left Sumeru in a hurry.
Traveler: Yeah, and I also have a theory.
Traveler: I think The Balladeer is the reason why The Doctor is targeting Haypasia.
Dehya: Hmm. Maybe the Fatui want to cover up some secret of The Balladeer? Is that why they tried to seize Haypasia?
Paimon: You said The Balladeer claimed that Haypasia has seen his past... So what could be there?
Traveler: For now, I'm still not really sure.
Dehya: Have you noticed? The Balladeer is not happy with The Doctor's actions. He thinks The Doctor has no right to consider himself as his equal.
Paimon: So, if The Doctor was to show up again, would The Balladeer zap him with lightning?
Dehya: #Based on what {NICKNAME} has said, I think he would. Having The Doctor gone benefits him as well as us.
Dehya: In other words, we've successfully completed this stage of the plan! The Doctor is out of the picture now.
Paimon: Yay, that's a big accomplishment!
Tighnari: Ugh! I'm... also happy for you.
Dehya: Thank you for the help, Tighnari. Make sure you rest up for now.
Traveler: Yes, please do get some rest.
Tighnari: Yeah, yeah... alright.
Dehya: #Okay, that wraps things up for us here at Pardis Dhyai. {NICKNAME}, it's about time we rendezvous with the others at the Grand Bazaar.
Dehya: Let's continue to keep a low profile. You can head there once you're ready.
Traveler: Her consciousness connected to The Balladeer, and she has seen his past...

## Talk 13

Alhaitham: Alright, everyone is here.
Dehya: How did everything go? Any luck with your missions?
Alhaitham: Let's each report back one by one. I'll start first.
Alhaitham: We have made the necessary modifications to the Akasha Terminal. In addition, the props required are also ready.
Dehya: #I'll go next. {NICKNAME} and I went to Pardis Dhyai. The situation was a bit complicated, but we found Tighnari. Unfortunately, he was wounded during a fight.
Cyno: ...Who was behind it?
Dehya: #Uh... Well, that's the tough part... What should I say, {NICKNAME}? "The Fatui" or "The Balladeer"?
Traveler: Let's go with "The Balladeer."
Cyno: ...
Dehya: After some back-and-forth, we confirmed that The Doctor has left Sumeru by boat. He has something urgent to attend to back in Snezhnaya.
Dehya: So, we've successfully removed The Doctor from the picture. Also, Tighnari's already resting, so he'll be okay.
Alhaitham: Good.
Paimon: Oh, Tighnari also asked us to tell you this message! "Trust your own senses and experiences."
Cyno: Alright... I'll remember that.
Cyno: Everything also went smoothly on my side. The Eremites should have arrived at their destination by now.
Cyno: To avoid alerting the quarry, they will stay there for now.
Dehya: I can't believe you actually got so many Eremites into Sumeru City!
Cyno: It's all thanks to Rahman and his brave team, as well as their bold strategy.
Alhaitham: It appears to have been very effective. I'm glad to hear it.
Alhaitham: Well, is that everything? Okay, this meeting is adjourned.
Dehya: Huh? Wait, you mean that's it?
Alhaitham: Well, what else is there to discuss?
Dehya: Shouldn't you end with some words of encouragement? You know, to fire us up now?
Alhaitham: Personally, I'd rather we all go home and get some rest.
Cyno: ...
Dehya: Alhaitham, you... *sigh*
Alhaitham: Oh, and if you wanted someone to say something to that effect, then I must reiterate that I'm here to strategize, not to lead.
Alhaitham: So you should find someone more suitable to do that.
Dehya: But I thought all of you Akademiya big-shots were great speakers?
Alhaitham: Then I should remind you that I'm the Scribe.
Dehya: I know that, so what?
Alhaitham: A Scribe is responsible for recording meetings, not speaking.
Dehya: ...Fine, whatever.
Dehya: Well, Cyno doesn't seem to be much of a talker, either. I guess that leaves it to my "employer."
Cyno: Employer?
Dehya: #Yep, {NICKNAME} hired me.
Traveler: She asked for a smile as her payment.
Dehya: Haha, that's right. So c'mon, boss! What do you have to say for the team?
Paimon: Yeah! Say something to boost morale!
Traveler: Hmm... let me think...
Nilou: Huh? What are you all doing here?
Paimon: Oh, it's Nilou!
Nilou: Hey everyone! I'm not disturbing you, am I?
Dehya: Not at all. I was actually just about to go find you.
Nilou: Heehee. Uh, judging from the group and all your serious faces, you were discussing something important, weren't you?
Nilou: But you also look like you're up to no good... Haha, seems pretty interesting.
Alhaitham: Welcome, Nilou. Would you like to join us?
Nilou: Huh? Join you?
Nilou: You mean... you also want to discuss something important... with me?
Alhaitham: Yes, something very important.
Alhaitham: Nilou, are there any breaks in your performance schedule in the upcoming days?
Nilou: Huh? Wait, you're seriously inviting me?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_BLACK_SCREEN): Alhaitham tells Nilou of the plan on Jnagarbha Day...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_BLACK_SCREEN): Nilou is shocked at first, but it isn't long before she's bubbling with excitement and anticipation.
Nilou: I... I can't believe my ears! You are truly the bravest and most passionate people of Sumeru, well, that... I've ever met!
Paimon: Ahem!
Nilou: #Oh right, {NICKNAME} and Paimon are not from Sumeru, but you are awesome as well!
Paimon: Hehe, that's right!
Nilou: I... I must admit that I'm a little scared.
Nilou: But I'll try my best for Lesser Lord Kusanali. If I can somehow use my abilities to help you, then count me in.
Cyno: Remember, believe in yourself.
Nilou: ...Okay! I'll get my friends at the Grand Bazaar to help us tomorrow!
Dehya: Just remember not to say too much. Be discreet.
Nilou: Yep, you got it!
Alhaitham: All the preparations are done. Now, can we finally conclude this meeting?
Traveler: Yeah. Tomorrow, we are going to save a god.
Dehya: So, have you thought up what you'd like to say, boss?
Traveler: It's hard to believe everything that has happened till now...
Paimon: Yep yep! It's a grand plan, and we're all super awesome!
Traveler: That's right, so...
Traveler: Just get a good night's sleep, everyone!
Dehya: Hahaha!
Cyno: Well said. A good night's rest before an operation can be the difference between success and failure.
Alhaitham: ...Thankfully, I've had my place to myself recently. It's been nice and quiet.
Dehya: ...Huh?
Alhaitham: Oh, huh, nothing.
Paimon: Alright, let's all go home and get a good night's sleep, so we can be up early tomorrow!
Nilou: Okay, so I guess that means it's time to say goodnight now.
Paimon: Yep! Goodnight, everyone.
Traveler: And our actions will bring change to many things tomorrow.
