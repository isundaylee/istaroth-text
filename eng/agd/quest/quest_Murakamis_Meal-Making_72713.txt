# Murakami's Meal-Making


## Talk 1

Traveler: Are you looking for some Mint?
Murakami: Mint, yes, Mint's what I need... With Mint, I could create whole new flavors...
Murakami: I'm guessing you accepted my commission? In which case, I'm guessing you also have 15 Mints for me...?
Traveler: You guess correctly, Sir.
Traveler: Not yet, actually.
Murakami: Oh, okay then. Well, just bring them here when you get them.

## Talk 2

Murakami: Great, then it's time for me to get to creating some new dishes! ...Oh, but first, it's time I paid you. Almost forgot!
