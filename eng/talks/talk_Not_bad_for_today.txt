Anthony: Not bad for today...
Anthony: What are you doing!? You frightened me!
Anthony: What are YOU doing?
Anthony: I... I'm not doing anything.
Anthony: Oh, well. You've caught me already, haven't you...
Anthony: It's just an ordinary water fountain, but somehow people treat it like a wishing well...
Anthony: Throwing their money away for nothing... But I could use that money!
Anthony: I am in desperate need of money... Please don't tell anyone.
Traveler: Why do you need the money?
Anthony: Because of Anna, my sister. You may have met her during the day.
Anthony: She's suffering from a rare disease, so she often comes here to make wishes.
Anthony: Why does it have to be her... She's such a kind and gentle kid... Why must it be her and not me...
Anthony: These coins somewhat make up for the medicine she needs, but I also work hard at my job, of course...
Anthony: If the archons are watching... I'm sure they will forgive my actions...
Anthony: Oh, sorry. Excuse me.
Anthony: Stop fooling around and scaring people. It's not good for the heart...
