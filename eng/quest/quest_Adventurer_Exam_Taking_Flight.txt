# Adventurer Exam: Taking Flight


## Talk 1

Anna: Oh, come on, why do we need stuff like a wind glider license?
Anna: Did you take the license exam, Anthony?
Anthony: I don't use wind gliders, so I've never taken the exam...
Traveler: You want to take the gliding exam, Anna?
Anna: Yup. It's something that all adventurers need to use, so I've been looking to practice!
Anna: But I never thought that there was such a thing as a gliding license...
Anna: I mean, I've already signed up to take part, but I don't think I have all the knowledge down pat just yet...
Anna: Traveler, I heard Amber mention that you've got a license already. Could you help me revise for the exam?
Traveler: Is Amber your proctor?
Anna: Well, no, but I just met her during the signup process.
Anna: She mentioned you while explaining the exam process to me. She said you did really well!
Anna: So I got to thinking that I could consult you about some of the exam questions...
Anna: Okay, so, I have three questions for you.
Anna: So... First off, how many people can a single wind glider carry while airborne?
Traveler: Alrighty then.
Anna: Great! Thanks a lot, Traveler.

## Talk 2

Traveler: One person per glider.
Anna: Hmm, I see...

## Talk 3

Traveler: That depends on how good the person doing the gliding is.
Anna: Huh, is that so...

## Talk 4

Traveler: That depends on the weight of the person gliding.
Anna: I see, I see...

## Talk 5

Anna: Second question: what should we take note of when using wind gliders?

## Talk 6

Traveler: To select appropriate take-off points and to assume the correct take-off posture.
Anna: Okay, interesting...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: Taking off using Anemo Slimes is always an interesting option.
Anna: Is this so? Huh...

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: You need to make sure that you're below the wind glider.
Anna: Hmm, I see...

### Additional Talk 3

Anna: Here's my third question, then: what should we take note of when landing?

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: Select an appropriate landing spot, and do not fold your wind glider in abruptly.
Anna: Alright, I see...

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: You have to mind your descent posture most of all.
Anna: Huh. Okay...

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: Make sure to find solid ground to land on.
Anna: Ah, is that so...

### Additional Talk 7

Anna: Hmm... I think I've more or less got it all down now! But I won't get anywhere just by listening...
Anna: Traveler, could you give me a demonstration of wind glider usage?
Traveler: No problem.
Anna: I sure will! Let's get going, then!
Traveler: Watch closely now.

### Additional Talk 8

Anna: Wow, you're really good at this! No wonder Amber said that I could learn a thing or two from you.
Anna: Hehe, with you as my coach, this exam will be a cinch!
Anna: Thanks so much! Here, these are for you. I'm off to revise some more!
Anna: I wonder what color my wind glider should be...
Anna: Blue? Green? Maybe a bit of both, perhaps?
