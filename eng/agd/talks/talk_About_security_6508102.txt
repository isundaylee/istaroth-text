Traveler: About security...
Plessia: The Gardemeks are in charge of daily security matters, and they aid their corresponding Gardes officers in conducting patrols.
Plessia: Machines are not omnipotent, after all. There are many things that can only be accomplished by humans.
Plessia: Gardemeks and the Gardes are both under the Maison Gardiennage.
Plessia: If something arises that they, too, cannot handle, then it shall be up to the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, or the Chief Justice's personal unit, the Marechaussee Phantom.
