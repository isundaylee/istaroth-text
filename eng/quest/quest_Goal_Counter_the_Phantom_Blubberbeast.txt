# Goal: Counter the "Phantom Blubberbeast!"


## Talk 1

Lepine-Pauline: You're back. So, did you find anything?

## Talk 2

Lepine-Pauline: Snappity-snap, printy-printy-printy... Stackity stack stack stack!
Lepine-Pauline: Whoa! Those two are kinda big deals!
Lepine-Pauline: Hey, you two! Can I take your picture?
Paimon: Huh...? Does she mean us? Why does she want our picture?
Traveler: She probably just wants a keepsake.
Paimon: Hehehe... Guess we'd better get used to the celebrity treatment, huh? Can't blame the fans for wanting a photo of their heroes!
Paimon: But if this is for anything besides your own personal use, then we're legally allowed to charge you... Wait, what would they call it here? An appearance fee? Photoshoot fee?
Lepine-Pauline: Absolutely! It's just an honor to be able to photograph the ace adventurer duo. How does one-and-a-half million Mora sound?
Paimon: Sure, that sounds fine!
Paimon: ...Hold up, how much did you say again? One-and-a-half million!? Did Paimon hear that right?
Paimon: That's a lot of Mora for just one photograph... Maybe a little too much? Are we really worth all that?
Traveler: Snap away! Take as many photos as you like!
Lepine-Pauline: Hah! You guys are overreacting. This measly one-and-a-half mil is just the start!
Lepine-Pauline: If you're interested in working with me as a photographer, you could potentially be taking home anywhere up to nine-figures! Snap some snaps and stack those stacks!
Paimon: Nine figures? That's... wait... every thousand is three figures, plus one for the one... so one million, that's seven, plus two is... ten million, a hundred million... A HUNDRED MILLION!?
Traveler: Now you're just throwing numbers out.
Paimon: Yeah! This all sounds too crazy even for Paimon to fall for it!
Paimon: What kind of racket are you running here? You planning on flashing a couple of famous faces to con innocent people?
Lepine-Pauline: Con innocent people! Hah, you took the words right out of my mouth!
Lepine-Pauline: But you got it back to front — my goal here is to rid Teyvat of everyone out there who's trying to con innocent people. Help me out, and there'll be a big bonus in it for you!
Paimon: Whoa, back up a little! Seems you skipped a couple of steps... How did you get from photography to... crime fighting?
Lepine-Pauline: Well, it all has to do with an important problem in law enforcement that often gets overlooked: target recognition.
Lepine-Pauline: Common sense says that if Gardemeks want to fight crime, the first thing they need to do is identify who's a criminal and who isn't. Right?
Lepine-Pauline: But what happens when a Gardemek mistakes an honest citizen for a criminal? Or sees someone brandishing a weapon in public, but fails to flag them as a potential threat? Then you've got a huge problem!
Lepine-Pauline: Think of the poor fisherman whose fishing rod gets mistaken for a spear! Or the crafty crook who carries around a metal pipe to club his victims with, but dismissed as a regular plumber!
Paimon: Okay... Fair enough, you're kinda making sense now...
Lepine-Pauline: Great. Okay, so let's say I disguise myself as a cat, or a dog, or a finch, or a pigeon — or maybe even a Blubberbeast, because why the heck not? So I'm walking around the city streets like an escaped amusement park employee, and a Gardemek sees me. How do you think it would respond?
Traveler: Sorry, how did we get to amusement parks?
Paimon: That's cheating!
Paimon: A Gardemek's not gonna do anything to some cute little critter. Also, what kind of Blubberbeast would even want to come to the city anyway...
Lepine-Pauline: Bingo! Right answer.
Lepine-Pauline: Gardemeks are incapable of registering cats, dogs, finches, pigeons — and, of course, Blubberbeasts — as potential targets. Their image recognition system actually ignores them completely.
Lepine-Pauline: It is actually fairly logical, if you think about it. Removing all the near-zero-risk entities from the target database boosts performance in most situations.
Lepine-Pauline: But here's a quote from a recent report in The Steambird: "Several keen-eyed thieves who noticed a flaw in the Gardemeks detection systems disguised themselves as Blubberbeasts during the commission of their crimes"...
Lepine-Pauline: Completely blind to the would-be-Blubberbeasts, the Gardemeks made no attempt to intervene in the thefts committed by the gang.
Traveler: Those crafty crooks!
Paimon: Wait, so this actually happened? And the Gardemeks really didn't catch them?
Paimon: Okay, that's pretty gutsy... But also kinda horrifying. What if they get bored of petty theft, and move to something even worse? They could get away with anything!
Lepine-Pauline: Exactly. And that's why we have to fight these criminals in the domain of technology. It's turned into an ongoing tug-of-war between their disguises and our image recognition capabilities.
Lepine-Pauline: And I, Lepine-Pauline, specialist in Graph Adversarial Technology, am determined to do my part towards a crime-free future for Fontaine!
Lepine-Pauline: Currently, I'm in the process of collecting sample images. Once I have a large enough pool, I'll use that to develop a simple but powerful and highly accurate image-recognition algorithm that runs on a small graphical processing module...
Lepine-Pauline: Any clockwork meka installed with this module will instantly be able to recognize people wearing disguises and accurately assess the criminal threat they pose.
Lepine-Pauline: And if all goes to plan, the Palais Mermonia will jump at the chance to have these installed on every Gardemek in the city... It's the business opportunity of a lifetime!
Traveler: And this all starts with you doing street photography?
Paimon: Paimon's getting deja vu... Lemme guess, you're a homebody researcher who prefers to stick to the city, limiting your potential sample size...
Paimon: And the reason you wanna work with us is because we can go out into the wild and help you get all the other photos you need. Right?
Lepine-Pauline: Wow, haha... Right again! Down to the last detail... Sounds like the ace adventurer duo has seen it all before.
Lepine-Pauline: Whaddaya say? Join my project, become a Graph Adversarial Technology specialist, and together we can expose every costumed offender in Fontaine!
Lepine-Pauline: Crucially, with your help, we can build a solid Graph Adversarial tech pipeline and take Fontaine's technology and law enforcement capabilities to the next level! Everybody wins!
Paimon: Hmm... This does sound like it's for a good cause...
Paimon: Forget the Mora — we can't stand by and do nothing... There are criminals out there giving Blubberbeasts a bad name, and that's something Paimon won't stand for!
Traveler: Justice for Blubberbeasts!
Lepine-Pauline: Great! And just like that, welcome to the team!
Lepine-Pauline: Okay, take this — it's an Image Recognition Sample Collector. It contains recording and analysis equipment that I designed myself, and comes complete with a user guide!
Lepine-Pauline: I've already looked through lots of images from all over to determine the key features of the samples I'd like to collect. All you need to do is work your way through the guide, get the pictures, and bring them back to me. Simple!
Lepine-Pauline: Let's get this show on the road, everyone. We must win the tug-of-war against evildoers... and score some big-ticket orders from the Palais Mermonia!
Traveler: Nine-figure bonus, here we come!
Traveler: I think you might have some trouble getting enough samples...
Traveler: So devious!
Traveler: A disguise? Don't you mean a costume?
Traveler: I have doubts about your sincerity.
Traveler: This sounds too good to be true...
Traveler: But if it's for commercial use, we could charge her for it...
