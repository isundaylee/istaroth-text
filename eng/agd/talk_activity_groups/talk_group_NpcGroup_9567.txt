Wriothesley: I've seen some card game venues where they seal up the windows so no light can get in. That way, the customers lose track of time and never know when to stop. The boss of this place hasn't done that though. I guess they must be pretty confident in their business.

Wriothesley: This deck is really delivering the goods. Shall we swap decks for the next round?

Wriothesley: These cards aren't really working together, are they... I'll have to make some changes.
