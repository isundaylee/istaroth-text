Ami: Why do people like to cook out in the open...?

Traveler: Maybe because it's fun.
Ami: Is it really fun? What's so fun about cooking out in the open?
Ami: I don't get it.
Ami: And what if a bug falls into the pot? That's not fun at all...
Ami: That would be a pity, for the bug, also for the grown-ups who eat the food with the bug in it. It's not worth it at all.

Traveler: Maybe it's because they have no choice...
Ami: What type of people can only cook outdoors? Is it because they don't have a home?
Ami: Then they really don't have a choice. That's sad.
Ami: But my dad has a home. Why does he still set up a fire and pot outside?
Ami: Is dad doing this for the homeless people?
Ami: Hmm... I think I get it now.
Ami: Wait, that's not right. Why does dad set up a fire and pot outside for himself, too?
Ami: I don't get it now!

Traveler: Just keep your eyes on the pot.
Ami: Do I need to keep watching until it's done?
Ami: Um... That actually makes sense. If you don't pay attention, bugs might fly in, or you might overcook it.
Ami: Ah, cooking is so complicated! Why doesn't everyone just eat fresh fruits? They are so sweet and delicious!
Ami: That way, no one has to cook or worry about bugs and overcooking!
