Traveler: Hello. What is this place?
Abundi: Here's the Obsidian Totem Pole that belongs to us, the Flower-Feather Clan.
Abundi: If you've been to the other tribes, then you've probably seen similar stone pillars before.
Abundi: This totem pole looked like this when I was a kid, and hasn't changed a bit. It has always borne witness to the ebbs and flows our clan has gone through.
Abundi: I believe we shall continue to soar high so long as it endures.
