Traveler: Do you like fountains?
Blathine: Yup, I do. Fountain water never stops — it's full of life!
Blathine: Take these tall pillars of water, especially — sometimes they're up, and sometimes they're down. Aren't they like the music that plays in the background during an opera?
Blathine: That said, I don't really like watching performances at the opera house. They're created, engineered human behavior — they're not real to me.
