# Talk Dialog

Venti: I didn't expect you to come by here. Unless... oh, were you following the fragrance of wine on the wind?
Traveler: Do you want to chat?
Venti: Sure, the sound of your voice is always a pleasure to hear.
Traveler: About the blessings...
Venti: Blessings? Oh, that.
Venti: Between you and me... I breathed a sigh of relief when nobody said their wishes out loud during the toast. That would've really put me in a tough spot. Hahaha... The Anemo Archon, Barbatos, doesn't have unlimited power, you know.
Venti: I had to take a really deep breath to get the winds of the far-flung past blowing. I nearly went blue in the face.
Traveler: About Razor...
Venti: He's grown up so much recently... It's such a joy to see.
Venti: Huh... Suddenly I sound just like an old grandpa.
Venti: He was lucky to have friends like you ready to support him through all this.
Venti: I see a kind, gentle soul, with a healthy dose of romance and freedom, too... In other words, a true Mondstadter, who grew up drinking the water of Cider Lake.
Venti: You, on the other hand... Don't worry, you're the gentlest soul I've ever met.
Traveler: About drinking...
Venti: Oh, I've been very busy on that front. I'd long since drunk my fill by Windcoming Day.
Venti: But, uh, I wasn't counting on everyone bringing out their finest vintage to welcome me.
Venti: Ah, the fragrance alone was so intoxicating... I had no choice but to make room for a few more rounds...
Venti: Full disclosure â€” I also secretly hid two bottles away for myself at the end.
Traveler: I'll leave you in peace.
Venti: Then go, my friend. The stories that unfolded here shall be remembered by the wind in the form of verse.
