Traveler: About the middle gearwheel...
Camden: Oh, that... That's, uh, an old issue from way back when.
Camden: Just don't go touching it again, please. I don't want my whole world to start spinning while I'm enjoying a proper snooze...
Camden: And if something does go wrong I can't act like I didn't see anything this time. I mean, I'm right here.
Camden: And if say I didn't see anything, that would prove I've been sleeping on the job. I hope you can understand.
