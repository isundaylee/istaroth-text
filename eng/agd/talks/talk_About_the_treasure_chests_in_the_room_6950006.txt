Traveler: About the treasure chests in the room...
Wolfy: "The audience should support the wonderful performance put on by the guests most generously"... Or that's what I heard. Though they're only toy medals, they represent how much the audience approves of the show you put on!
Wolfy: That's also the reason these Toy Medals are the perfect currency to exchange for "Thespian Tricks."
Wolfy: So, when the brilliant golden glow of the treasure beckons, don't you hesitate, just go open it!
