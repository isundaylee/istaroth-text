Sorimana: Hello there, do you need help? Weren't bowled over by a passing Saurian, were you?

## Talk

Traveler: Does that happen often?
Sorimana: Shouldn't happen often, in theory... It's true that some Saurians aren't particularly friendly, but they normally wouldn't attack us unless provoked.
Sorimana: But there have been quite a few rumors about Saurians ramming into people near the places where I usually drop off supplies.
Sorimana: Speaking of which, I work for the Courier's Longhouse, and it's my job to leave regular drops of food and other supplies at the places where our Couriers tend to stop off.
Sorimana: Some are for humans, whereas others have been specifically designed for their Saurian companions.

Traveler: Nah, I'm doing fine.
Sorimana: Great.

Traveler: They might've been attracted by food.
Sorimana: ...Ahhh! That's a good point!
Sorimana: If Saurians or wild animals began to expect food to regularly appear at certain places, it's certainly possible that they'd start hanging around there...
Sorimana: And if they were starving, it's not impossible that they might end up charging into people...
Sorimana: Thank you for helping me realize what might be going on! I'll have to think of a way of testing this theory out...

## Talk

Traveler: How do we verify that?
Sorimana: Hmm... How about this, then? You take these and walk around the wilds a bit more. See if any Saurians crash intoâ€” err, I mean, approach you?
Sorimana: With your skills, you should be able to dodge them, right?
