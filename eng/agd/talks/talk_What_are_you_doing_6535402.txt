Traveler: What are you doing?
Bossuet: Oh, right. I'm working on tonight's menu. After much contemplation, I decided on fish for the main dish, to go with a few special drinks...
Bossuet: I'm sure those gentlemen will be pleased.
Bossuet: Thanks to the God King's grace, the spices I ordered finally arrived on time, and combined with some fish fresh from the ocean...
Bossuet: Well, feel free to stay and have a taste! Trust me, fish are my specialty!
