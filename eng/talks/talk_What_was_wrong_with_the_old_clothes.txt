Traveler: What was wrong with the old clothes?
Hunza: It kinda fell apart.
Hunza: Eh, that kind of thing happens all the time! You can't really do extreme sports without accepting that things will get damaged or broken. In the end, it's just a change of clothes. I can afford that much.
Hunza: Still, I've gotta admit, it was pretty wild skateboarding on a mountain crest less than half a meter wide without any protective gear.
Hunza: Thankfully, I had my most faithful and considerate Saurian sidekick with me! Katari has always been there for me... Wait, where did he go?
Hunza: Weird... I could have sworn he was with me just a moment ago!
