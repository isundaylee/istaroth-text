Traveler: What is this place?
Ezana: Here, we sell masks in the styles of all the different tribes. Let me know if you see anything you like the look of.
Ezana: In the extremely unlikely event that none of our pre-made masks take your fancy, we also have materials for you to make your own.
Ezana: If you make one yourself, you'll only be charged the cost of the materials.
