# Solitary Sea-Beast


## Talk 1

Kumi: ...
Kumi: ...Ah, sorry, I didn't expect you guys to be back so soon.
Kumi: Do you need anything...?
Traveler: I brought what you asked for.
Traveler: It's nothing, we're still trying to look for the petals.
Kumi: Thank you for your hard work, it's good to take a break here.

## Talk 2

Kumi: Thank you so much! I knew I could count on you guys!
Kumi: ...Mm, these are enough to make a wreath of flowers, thank you once again.
Kumi: By the way... I have one more thing I want to ask of you, I don't know if you guys mind...
Paimon: Since we've already helped you out, feel free to tell us, Miss Kumi!
Traveler: What happened?
Kumi: ...It's like this. I heard from the elders of Bourou Village that there is hilichurl activity again on the beach to the west.
Kumi: It so happens that a researcher from Sumeru passed by here the other day and is heading there... I think her name is Anisa, and she hasn't returned yet.
Kumi: I'm quite worried about her...
Paimon: That researcher... Is she your friend?
Kumi: Are friends the only ones worth worrying about?
Kumi: Sorry, I mean... I don't really know her well, but I'm just worried.
Traveler: I understand.
Kumi: Sorry to trouble you again... If it weren't for the fact that I can't handle myself in fights...
Paimon: It's okay, you don't have to blame yourself! Let's just go help!
Traveler: I'll help to find her.
Traveler: Do you need help?

## Talk 3

Anisa: *panting* Phew... Thank you, if it weren't for your help, I'm afraid I would be dead...
Traveler: No need to thank us.
Paimon: You're Anisa, right? Miss Kumi asked us to come!
Anisa: Kumi...? Oh! It's that...local lass who looks a bit gloomy but is very nice, right?
Traveler: Lass...?
Paimon: What a strange and flippant way of describing her...
Anisa: Hehe... Actually, I forgot her name. I really shouldn't have. I'll have to thank her properly later on.
Anisa: Oh, yes, her name is "Kumi," right?
Paimon: That's right! You shouldn't be a researcher with a memory like that!
Anisa: Yes, I remember this time! Kumi, that's a cute name. Kumi...
Traveler: *coughing*
Anisa: Ah, sorry, I didn't introduce myself, although you might already know...
Anisa: I'm Anisa. Anisa Purbiruni. Trainee Dastur at Sumeru Akademiya's Oceanographic Society.
Anisa: As for my surname, Purbiruni, it's because my academic lineage dates back five centuries to the great scholar, the sage Biruni.
Anisa: Ah, every time I mention this, a pride that cannot be expressed in words wells up within me unbidden!
Paimon: Man, she's like some rich girl bragging about her dad's money...
Traveler: Kumi's very worried about you.
Anisa: Hehe...
Paimon: What are you laughing about?
Anisa: Nothing... I'm just a little embarrassed about making people worry about me...
Paimon: Paimon's surprised that you can be embarrassed at all!
Anisa: However, there are still things that I have yet to do. The research I have on hand has not yet borne fruit, and so I must hurry.
Anisa: You know, the statues of Watatsumi here are the object of my research. The traditional beliefs of the people of Watatsumi are very fascinating.
Paimon: Eh?
Anisa: In antiquity, the priests... uh, I mean, shrine maidens of Watatsumi would place permanently-given offerings under memorials.
Anisa: After that, they would protect those offerings with sophisticated mechanical puzzles or simple elemental techniques.
Paimon: What?
Anisa: This was originally a manner of protecting and storing objects that were offered...
Anisa: But people gradually discovered the joys of solving puzzles for their own sake, and even considered this a way of communicating with the now-deceased through one's intellect.
Anisa: As such, the solving of puzzles became melded together with religious rituals, resulting in a most unique tradition.
Anisa: As such, apart from the usual offerings, "solving puzzles left by those who came before" and seeking the "desires of the heart" also became rituals of worship or divination.
Anisa: Of course, the better part of this is my personal guesswork. If we want to be sure, we'll need to conduct a great deal of folklore studies.
Traveler: So, these "desires of the heart" are actually...
Anisa: It's as you've guessed. I'm referring to the riches offered to the statues of Watatsumi — the gifts of forebears to their descendants.
Paimon: Riches!
Anisa: By which I mean treasure, of course — treasure!
Paimon: Treasure!
Anisa: Your little companion seems to have a strong interest in my topic of study. How about it, then? Interested in lending me a hand?
Traveler: Paimon...
Paimon: Come on, there's treasure! Let's just help out, shall we?
Anisa: As for me, I'm not all that interested in treasure. I just need my research results.
Anisa: It'll be great if you're willing to help. The treasure's all yours. Consider it your payment for helping me out!
Paimon: Woohoo!
Anisa: Woohoo!
Traveler: Please stop ignoring me!
Anisa: Oh, don't worry. Let's start right here!
Traveler: I'll consider it.
Traveler: What happened to my Paimon...

## Talk 4

Kumi: Hello there. Thanks for bringing Anisa back safe and sound.
Traveler: You're welcome.
Anisa: Hello there, Little... uh, Miss Kumi. Sorry for making you worry.
Kumi: I'm just glad to see that you're all right. I've just finished my garland, too.
Kumi: Sorry for taking up your time. Let me give her this garland...
Anisa: Mm, please go ahead.
Kumi: Thank you.
Kumi: I hope that my feelings, though late, will get through to her.
Kumi: I'm... all alone again...
Anisa: What was her name?
Kumi: ...?
Paimon: Eh, why are you suddenly asking that?
Traveler: (Shh...)
Anisa: I hear that the people of Watatsumi give each individual a unique name.
Anisa: If you don't mind me asking, what was your friend's name?
Kumi: Kuntira.
Anisa: That's a lovely name.
Kumi: Thank you...
Kumi: The elders on the island say that "kuntira" means "whale" in the ancient language.
Kumi: But I chose this name because I like it...
Anisa: Well, it also fits with "Kumi," doesn't it? It's a lovely name!
Paimon: (What's she doing!?)
Traveler: (Best we avoid disturbing them, Paimon.)
Kumi: Um, thank you.
Anisa: *cough* Apologies. I spoke a little out of turn.
Kumi: That's okay.
Kumi: She was the last remnant of their kind. She was born alone, and she died alone.
Kumi: Born in the sea, dying on land where she didn't belong, suffocating in the air...
Kumi: Recently I've been thinking, sooner or later, this might be my destiny as well.
Paimon: Eh...?
Traveler: (......)
Anisa: ...
Anisa: It's not like that.
Kumi: There's no need to persuade me... I understand what you're thinking... but after all, you and I are not the same...
Kumi: I wasn't born here, nor do I belong to my father's hometown...
Anisa: No, I was talking about the pelvic bones.
Kumi: ...?
Anisa: Yes, the pelvic bones.
Traveler: Pelvic bones...?
Paimon: Pelvic bones? What are you talking about?
Anisa: *cough* It's like this...
Anisa: Have you guys noticed, that unlike a whale, she still has well-developed pelvic bones.?
Paimon: Not at all... How did you notice?
Anisa: Since I first arrived here, I have been paying attention to its pelvic structure... and the traces it left behind. I suppose you can call this an academic's instinct, hehe.
Anisa: Hmmm...for example, when we give birth, we experience strong expansions and contractions, and as such, a stable support structure that protects our internal organs and soft tissues is indispensable.
Anisa: Our pelvis is the structure that performs this function, and for Kuntira, her pelvis is the same.
Kumi: ...
Paimon: Well...
Traveler: Oh...
Anisa: A pelvis that has undergone childbirth tends to show a certain degree of deformation and wear due to expansion and contraction.
Anisa: The body shape of primitive marine creatures tends to be teardrop-shaped, so their pelvises are also narrower.
Anisa: In other words, the marks of pelvic deformation are more obvious and easier to observe.
Kumi: Hmmm...is that so?
Paimon: Huh...
Traveler: Oh...
Anisa: Ah, sorry, I've just been talking about common knowledge. I suppose I've been boring you all to death.
Kumi: Oh no, please continue...
Kumi: You have a very beautiful tone of voice, at least. Has anyone ever told you that?
Anisa: Uhm... Thank you... I never noticed... *cough* *cough* Um, thanks.
Anisa: Ahem... Back to the topic at hand... As such, I have grounds to fully refute your reasoning.
Anisa: Based on the deformations of the pelvic bones, she must have undergone many births. It seems she had found her home in the sea, and...
Kumi: She had more than one offspring...
Paimon: Wow...
Anisa: Hmmm, in other words, she found her own happiness.
Kumi: But if that's the case...then why would she...
Traveler: Stay stranded here...?
Kumi: ...
Anisa: Haha, that's your second mistake, Miss Kumi.
Anisa: Stranded sea animals often show signs of distortion and strain on certain parts of their vertebrae.
Anisa: If you must know why, it's because suffocating is... very painful.
Kumi: ...
Anisa: But based on my preliminary observations, Kuntira's spine is straight, almost as if she did not experience any painful struggle...
Anisa: Based on a rough observation of her bone age, I would estimate that she passed away safely before she came to shore...
Anisa: As for why she came to this familiar place in her final hours...
Anisa: Maybe this was her way of telling her good friend that she had lived a happy and fulfilling life.
Kumi: ...
Kumi: Thank you.
Anisa: So, you've got to live well, too.
Kumi: ...?
Kumi: Yes... I will.
Kumi: ...You know, I would always feel torn as to whether I should return to my home on Narukami Island or to stay here in Bourou Village...
Anisa: Before, I was also torn whether to head back to Akademiya or stay in this country.
Anisa: Due to the war, confusion, the pressure from the Shogunate...it's all too much, and many people have considered giving up.
Anisa: But one must make a choice, to continue or to give up. Choosing to continue may still wind up being fruitless, but choosing to give up...
Kumi: I won't give up.
Kumi: When it's war or government, they're just another problem. This is another matter entirely...
Anisa: Haha, you're right!
Anisa: Think about it, hundreds of years later when people talk about this war, they can only lament the tragedy it caused and how meaningless it all was.
Anisa: But when they talk about the history of Watatsumi Island, about your friends, and you and me, they will remember...
Kumi: That this island had a daredevil that stumbled out and somehow unlocked some of the truths behind our history?
Anisa: Yes, and that there also lived a girl who befriended a giant sea creature, and thus decided where her home should be.
Kumi: ...
Kumi: When she was young, when she first met me, I had a similar feeling... the feeling that my life was only just beginning.
Anisa: Then let your life begin once again — this time, without any fear of loss.
Paimon: (Ohh, Paimon's getting mad! We were running all these errands for them, and here they are, chatting away!)
Traveler: (Relax, Paimon.)
Anisa: Uh, having said that, there is one thing that I must ask you, Miss Kumi.
Paimon: Wow... You're so formal all of a sudden!
Traveler: She's got some other agenda, huh...
Anisa: I might have to stay on Watatsumi Island to study marine life in the long term... So in the meantime, could I, uh...
Kumi: Do you mean that you want to... study Kuntira's children?
Anisa: No, I want to try making friends with her children.
Anisa: And... if you don't mind, Miss Kumi— Well, it's at your convenience, of course, I wouldn't want to...
Kumi: I live in Bourou Village. I'm sure I could give you a room, as long you're alright with it.
Kumi: I'd love to meet her children as well. Maybe that was what she wanted me to see — the family that she cared about.
Anisa: Thank you!
Kumi: And there's no need to learn how to speak as we do. I think you speak beautifully as it is.
Anisa: Hehe... Well then, thanks a lot, Lit— I mean, Miss Kumi!
Paimon: Eh... It feels like we've been left out in the cold.
Traveler: Just a little.
Kumi: #Thank you so much for you help as well, Traveler, Paimon. I will not forget this.
Anisa: Hehe, me too! My future lectures will always have seats open for you!
Paimon: What? No, Paimon's not here to study!
Traveler: It is how it is, Paimon.
Traveler: *cough* *cough*...
Traveler: I only did as I should've.

## Talk 5

Kumi: Ah, it's you. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Traveler: We found Anisa.
Kumi: Oh, thank you. How is she?
Traveler: She's in one piece and then some.
Kumi: Mmm, as long as she's alright... She can be really reckless, and it's very worrying.
Kumi: I know that we're still practically strangers, but I wouldn't want to see anyone get hurt needlessly, especially at times like these...
Kumi: Also, she... Never mind...
Traveler: She's just busy with her research topic.

## Talk 6

Kumi: Can I help you with anything?
Traveler: About Anisa...
Kumi: She's a researcher from Sumeru. She's rather reckless, but she has a beautiful voice...
Kumi: She said that her field of study was Oceanic Sanctuary Storage... something. I'm not sure what that's about, really.
Kumi: But she seems to be very interested in that Watatsumi statue on the beach to the west...
Traveler: Watatsumi statue?
Kumi: Mm-hmm. The village elder used to say that if we could solve the shrine maiden's puzzle, then "our heart's desire" would emerge.
Kumi: Hehe, I used to believe that. Everyday, I would swim near that statue... That was actually how I met my good friend as well.
Kumi: But I grew out of that a long time ago. I no longer believe in those stories.
Kumi: Still, I can't help but feel happy for Anisa — that she still has so much interest and passion regarding these old legends.
Kumi: I hope that she finds what she seeks...
Kumi: Well, but before that, please find out if she's alright. Thank you very much.

## Talk 7

Anisa: Well then, congratulations are in order!
Traveler: These are offerings, you know...
Anisa: Haha, it's fine. It's like I said, this is a symbol of "the heart's desire."
Anisa: The forebears of this land left it to those who came after, as a symbol of faith and a token of trust. In fact, hmm, you could consider it a concrete way of "passing memories on."
Anisa: So be at ease and just take it. It's yours by right.
Anisa: The people of Watatsumi understood this very early on: the fruits of wisdom are to be given to those who respect it.
Anisa: ...Just like you and me!
Paimon: Does Paimon count too?
Anisa: Of course! Thanks for your hard work!
Traveler: You're most welcome.
Paimon: Ah, no need to be so formal!
Anisa: *sigh* Still, this thesis I'm working on is such a headache.
Paimon: Eh? Didn't you have a breakthrough already?
Anisa: Well, yes. But I've spent far too much time on just one subject.
Anisa: To formally become a Dastur as opposed to remaining a trainee, you need to have two different theses pass through the review stage...
Anisa: I can ask for an extension, of course, but I do still need to find a second topic.
Anisa: My second field of study is actually marine biology, but due to the recent instability in Inazuma, I've had to call a halt to research on that front.
Traveler: Hmm, marine biology, you say...
Anisa: Eh? What is it?
Paimon: Oh right! Miss Kumi's good friend!
Anisa: Huh? Haha, I don't think she and I have gotten that far yet...
Paimon: ...?
Traveler: ...
Anisa: Eh!? Oh... Oh right! I remember now!
Paimon: What does this person fill their brain with, Paimon wonders...
Anisa: I actually had a passing glance at that creature earlier. If I'm not mistaken, the skeleton is that of an Umibouzu — or at least, that's what the people of Narukami Island call it.
Anisa: They are huge, intelligent and savage sea monsters, and were once considered the arch-nemesis of all sailors.
Anisa: They were overly clever and overly proud... Just like us humans. I suppose that's why they came into conflict with us and became savage beasts.
Anisa: These sea creatures have been all but wiped out in most ocean regions, but it seems that this isn't the case here...
Anisa: It seems as though they've even grown close to humanity. This is a very unusual phenomenon indeed. Very interesting.
Anisa: Thanks a lot! I knew I was right to call on you two for help.
Anisa: Well, time's a-wasting here. Let's head back and look for Miss Kumi!
Paimon: Yup, let's go!
Traveler: Paimon's talking about a sea creature.
Traveler: I just thought of something...
Traveler: Can we really take them?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Anisa: It's fine if you can't solve it for now. The puzzle isn't going to run away or anything!
Anisa: I'll be here too — so just relax.
