Traveler: Have you seen anyone around that looks a lot like me?
Myweiss: Hmm? You mean, you're looking for a relative?
Myweiss: You don't look or dress anything like a local, so I'm sure anyone who looks like you would have made an impression... Sorry, it seems I haven't seen them.
Myweiss: I hope you find your lost relative soon. You have my full support! Being related by blood is the only real connection you can have in this world. Not love, as some imbeciles would have you believe.
