Traveler: So, what's this shop all about?
Kaede: We mainly sell souvenirs, like Inazuman novels, tanuki dolls, and stuff like that.

Kaede: Sadly, we haven't really seen that many customers since the lockdown came into effect except for those Snezhnayan merchants who want to entertain their families.
