Traveler: About Anahitian Blessing...
Jahan: What, you never heard of the Anahitian Blessing?
Jahan: It's practically essential to growing crops, and it's not an overstatement to say it's our savior.
Jahan: Oh wait, I should say the Dendro Archon is our savior, since the Blessing is a gift from her.
Jahan: O Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, O Dendro Archon, may you grant us bountiful harvest!
