Glory: Huh? I recognize this voice... Traveler?
Glory: The Windblume festivities are in full swing! If you get time, do make sure to roam around. You'll find a very different Mondstadt.
Glory: Even better, if there's someone important to you, you should spend the festival with them. That's where the Windblume spirit truly resides...
Glory: The Windblume Festival is a celebration of comfort and warmth. If possible, I wish I could spend this time with my beloved, Godwin...
Glory: I still don't know how he's getting on... May the winds protect him.
