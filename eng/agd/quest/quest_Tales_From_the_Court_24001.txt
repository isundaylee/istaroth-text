# Tales From the Court


## Talk 1

Blathine: Barea dislikes places that are too lively. The opera house probably disturbed it and inspired its escape.
Blathine: It might be hiding in the bushes... Let's head to the patch over there.
Blathine: Not here... Hmmm, let's head elsewhere...

## Talk 2

Blathine: Well, there it is — and looking quite good, too.
Blathine: I wonder when Ms. Staelle will realize that dogs have no love for the opera, or for her novels?
Blathine: Let us return — she's probably worried sick.

## Talk 3

Staelle: Barea! Oh, my baby! Where have you been?
Blathine: It simply found a quiet spot to rest for a while. A bit of a vacation, you see.
Staelle: Ah, I was so worried! Thank you, Officer Blathine, thank you! You will be in my next novel for sure!
Blathine: Thank you for your consideration, but it might be best if you save the ink — I doubt anyone would be all that interested in the daily life of a police officer.
Staelle: Then I'll simply have to dramatize your tale... It will be interesting, I swear!
Blathine: That promise of yours is already too much drama for me, I think.
Staelle: Ah, the conclusion's got to be inspiring! Let me think — who shall I assign to be your partner...

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Staelle: Is it that Barea doesn't like my new novel? *sigh* But everyone else thinks it's pretty good...
Staelle: Perhaps I should read it a nicer passage...
