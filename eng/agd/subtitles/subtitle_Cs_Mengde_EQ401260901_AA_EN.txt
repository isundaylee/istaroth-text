Far from my native land I roamed
In streams I slept
Many seasons I met as the suns set and rose
I searched for a garden to call a home
And the moonlight ebbed as the water flowed
A soft breeze beckoned me unto a spring
"Sleep, weary wanderer, your journey is over"
"May the dancing petals sweeten your slumber"
At dawn I hummed the melody of a distant stream
And the songs in the night serenaded my dreams
A boy's tender tears trembled through the water
Stirring me more than any starlight sonata
He wove me a wreath from past petals and future buds
I crossed beyond the veil of dreams to the realm of flesh and blood
"Look at the love that shines from his eager gaze"
"Answer the call of his heart, lest this moment go to waste"
The kittens and fireflies invited my heartstrings to sing
But I was a stranger to the melody of mankind
And knew not how this tune should begin
As the river of dreams trickled into the ocean blue
Every time a crystalfly flapped its wings
Older it seemed he grew
But I learned to fathom human ways each stumbling step I took
And clouds of confusion became crystal clear in the vulnerable verse I wrote
As seed yearns for soil, and trees for the sun
A once-foreign melody inside my heart sung
And it cried out your name on every string it could strum
Now, I give my dream to you
May it be in your slumber a sweet spring to quench your thirst
Now, I hand my heart to you
Praying my belated promise might meet
Still with your trust
