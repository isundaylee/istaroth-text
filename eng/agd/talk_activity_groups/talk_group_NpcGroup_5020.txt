## Talk

Ismenor: Good evening. Are you out here on a stroll as well?

## Talk

Traveler: The night views are quite nice.
Ismenor: Haha, well now, that's not something you see every day — a young person with the same tastes as a retiree like myself.
Ismenor: The young lads and lasses are all like this continuously-moving statue in the middle of the plaza.
Ismenor: They're full of energy, yet they often know not what they do anything for.
Ismenor: Forgive my pessimism — it might be on account of my past as a Champion Duelist.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about the Champion Duelists...
Ismenor: It is a profession that exists to maintain dignity, yet lives alongside conflict.
Ismenor: Suspects who do not believe that they should have to stand trial will request a duel to defend their reputation.
Ismenor: Only concession or expiry can end a duel, and there are few who can defeat official Champion Duelists.
Ismenor: So I doubt it would be hard for you to imagine what happens to such suspects.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Ismenor: Farewell.
