Traveler: Do you do overseas delivery?
Tundama: Of course! If I ever want to leave Natlan, I just need to submit a request to the chief. I never have to wait long for approval.
Tundama: That said, I do most of my deliveries within our borders.
Tundama: If letters need to be sent abroad, we'll usually take them to the border, before handing them over to our colleagues from the other nations.
Tundama: Anyway, just leave it to me! I'll get it delivered â€” that's a promise!
