# A New Pilgrimage


## Talk 1

Paimon: Time sure flies, huh? The tournament's taking place tomorrow morning, so let's get some sleep while we can!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Let's go check on everyone and see if we can find any leads on Xbalanque before things kick off!

## Talk 3

Iansan: Huh? Did you go the wrong way?
Iansan: No worries, we can just start over again. Let me know when you're ready.

## Talk 4

Kinich: Without him around, it's so peaceful and quiet.
Kinich: Phew... Not bad.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Hmm, seems like we still haven't found any useful clues... Maybe we should just go back and check in with Mavuika.

## Talk 6

Paimon: That was a thrilling game! Paimon was on the edge of her seat...
Traveler: As expected, you're a pro, Mavuika... I concede.
Mavuika: You played well. We can play a few more rounds when we have the time.

## Talk 7

Iansan: Warming up before a competition is extremely important. Don't ever forget.

## Talk 8

Paimon: That was a thrilling game! Paimon was on the edge of her seat...

## Talk 9

Mavuika: Hey there, Boss, I'm here with some guests. I'll have the usual.
Hinchei: Ah, Pyro Archon! Welcome, welcome. It's been a while. Glad to see you with our new heroes, too.
Mavuika: #Boss, this is Traveler, and this is Paimon.
Traveler: Nice to meet you.
Paimon: Hi there!
Hinchei: Hehe, greetings to you both as well. You'll have the same as before, then?
Mavuika: We worked out today, so yeah, that would be great.
Paimon: Erm, so, what is "the usual"?
Traveler: We can just have some snacks. Paimon already eats too much as it is...
Paimon: #Oh, come on, Traveler! You've never been stingy even when we were low on Mora, so why are you're going after Paimon's food now that someone's treating us?
Hinchei: #Hahaha, you two are a riot. I get where Traveler's coming from, though. You're too cute not to tease, Miss Paimon.
Mavuika: If someone's down in the dumps, your banter can cheer them right up. That's not just from me, by the way. I've heard it from plenty of other people.
Paimon: #Ehh? F—For real? So, were you teasing Paimon on purpose, Traveler...?
Traveler: Of course. You can eat as much as you want.
Hinchei: Just leave it to us! Please wait a moment — your food will be out shortly.
Mavuika: Alright — eat your fill, Paimon, but just remember the tournament is in three days. So try and make sure your food coma is finished by then.
Paimon: What, what? Food coma? ...Hmph, dunno what you're talking about. Paimon will be there on time, don't you worry.
Traveler: Seems like you've also grown fond of teasing Paimon, Mavuika.
Mavuika: Haha, don't worry. In the event that you do oversleep a bit, I have my ways of waking you up...
Paimon: Really? You do? Uh...
Paimon: Ah! Speaking of your "ways," Mavuika, you still haven't told us about how you plan to find Xbalanque!
Mavuika: Oh, that? It's actually quite simple.
Mavuika: Xbalanque is a native of Natlan. The records speak of him as a wise, brave, and upright man, and refer to him as "The First Sun."
Mavuika: People like that tend to be like me, passionate about competition. The more they disdain dishonest ways of winning, the more they'll celebrate a fair victory.
Mavuika: You could call that a trait shared by all the heroes of Natlan. They are full of energy and passion, and despise victories born of deceit. Conversely, they're constantly drawn to things that are full of hope and excitement.
Paimon: You mean... Xbalanque might want to take part in this upcoming Pilgrimage?
Mavuika: It's not a matter of "might." He will.
Mavuika: It's precisely because such an important figure will be participating that we must prepare the best tournament possible.
Mavuika: Checking in on the various tribes was also to ensure that we'll be prepared to give him a warm welcome.
Mavuika: So... all we need to do is to look for him in the Stadium on that day. As the first Pyro Archon, he should have no problem running away with the whole competition.
Paimon: But, isn't it a bit unfair for the Pyro Archon themselves to participate in such a tournament? After all, everyone else is just an ordinary human...
Mavuika: When Xbalanque ascended to archonhood, he did so as a human. I see no problem in allowing him to participate in this event as a "human" from ancient times.
Mavuika: Also, my ineligibility for the event is not due to being Archon, but due to my obligation to serve as host and judge.
Paimon: Huh, that's kinda like your life as Archon... You haven't lost your human side, you're just too busy to indulge it...
Mavuika: Oh? Another good summary. I'll be sure to write it down and include it in my autobiography.
Paimon: You're working on an autobiography!?
Mavuika: No, I was joking. Even Xbalanque didn't write one, so why would I? Still, if on the off-chance I ever did write one, you two'd definitely be in it.
Paimon: Then... can Paimon have a super long title?
Mavuika: Sure, as long as you want.
Black Screen Text: The restaurant owner walks towards you with massive plates piled high with food in her hands, and Paimon is so excited that she can't stop spinning in the air.
Paimon: So many dishes, and such huge portions, too! Paimon spies mountains of meat as well... Wowee!!
Mavuika: Hmm? You know this is just a normal breakfast, right?
Paimon: Wait, what!?
Traveler: Wait, what!?
Hinchei: Our Archon's always had a healthy appetite. Hehe, please enjoy the food while it's still hot. Food never tastes as good once it gets cold.
Black Screen Text: The diligently prepared dishes are extremely delicious, and the two of you immediately begin to dig in.
Black Screen Text: And before you know it, Mavuika has polished off half of the grilled meat with elegance, serenity, and astonishing alacrity.
Black Screen Text: Paimon turns towards you with a frightened look. She realizes that she has met a truly terrifying opponent. From this day forth, Paimon can no longer claim the crown of the greatest meat eater.
Mavuika: Judging the state Paimon ate herself into, I assume you'll be staying someplace close by?
Paimon: Is that okay? Ehehe, actually, since it's so beautiful around here, we were planning to stay in the area for a few more days anyway, see the sights and all that!
Mavuika: Of course you can. I'll go arrange some accommodations for you, then.
Black Screen Text: Mavuika leaves the table briefly, before coming back and taking you to your lodgings.
Mavuika: Alright, I'll leave you here. Have a good rest.
Paimon: Alright, good night!
Paimon: How do you feel? Want another drink?
Traveler: I'm good... I'm full.
Paimon: Then... how about some dessert? Paimon still wants something sweet...
Paimon: Why are you looking at Paimon like that? There's always room for dessert!
Enthusiastic Man: Lord Xbalanque is coming back, huh? Well, I didn't see that coming... Wait, what's that look on your face? Don't tell me you don't even know who Xbalanque is?
Woman in Deep Thought: What kind of idiot do you take me for!? I was just thinking about it!
Woman in Deep Thought: I mean, we just managed to defeat the Abyss for good, and fulfill the wish of all citizens of Natlan, past and present... So why is he coming back now, of all times?
Enthusiastic Man: Yeah, if he's here to help, the war's already over. And if he isn't...
Enthusiastic Man: ...Uh, I just had a terrifying thought. What if he's actually some kind of villain who's come to steal our victory? Isn't that how the novels usually go?
Woman in Deep Thought: What? No! Don't be ridiculous! Novels are just fiction! Don't you slander our great hero. You're talking about Lord Xbalanque here, the one everyone calls The First Sun!
Woman in Deep Thought: Also, even if what you said were true, I don't think our Archon would lose! We all saw that one punch of hers. The power in it was like... Hah!
Enthusiastic Man: Yeah, I agree, but I'll bet Lord Xbalanque's no slouch, either! Say, if they fought, who do you think would win?
Woman in Deep Thought: ...Argh... Well, you've got me there.
Woman in Deep Thought: Well, as someone living in this age, I've got to vote for our Archon, right? Live in the now, seize the day, and all that.
Enthusiastic Man: Man, now that you mention it, a fight between those two is bound to be a terrific one... What I wouldn't give to watch!
Woman in Deep Thought: Alright, enough of that nonsense. It's already super late. If we keep hyping ourselves up, neither of us are gonna get any sleep tonight!
Paimon: The way they're talking about the archons duelling each other almost makes it sound like a beetle battle...
Traveler: Way more exciting than a beetle battle, that's for sure.
Paimon: Yeah! They really do love their contests of strength here in Natlan...
Traveler: (I'm looking forward to the tournament myself. How will the matches go? And who's going to come out on top?)
Traveler: (Will the legendary Xbalanque really participate? If he wins the whole thing, will Mavuika preside over the victory ceremony, too? The more I think about it, the more interesting it gets...)
Paimon: Phew! Alright. Paimon's done eating. Let's head back and get some sleep!
Black Screen Text: You and Paimon spend the next three days strolling around, eating, drinking, and relaxing to your hearts' content...
Black Screen Text: At last, the day of the tournament arrives.

## Talk 10

Paimon: That was a thrilling game! Paimon was on the edge of her seat...
Traveler: I managed to force the great Pyro Archon to a draw!
Mavuika: Indeed you did. I've noticed that you're very good at games. And now that I've found such a great opponent, we've got to have a rematch sometime.

## Talk 11

Paimon: ...Hey! Wake up! Wake up! The tournament's about to start!
Traveler: (...That voice... Ah, it's Paimon...)
Traveler: (Wait, the tournament!?)
Paimon: Oh no, we've overslept! Only a little bit, but... Okay, wash up and pack your things! We've gotta go go go!
Paimon: Aaaaaah, Paimon can't believe it, Mavuika totally called it! How could we have been so careless!?
Paimon: Is this what people mean when they say you can get so excited before a trip that you struggle to sleep the night before, only to miss setting out the next day...
Mavuika: Hey there. How are you feeling?
Paimon: Mavuika! Why are you here!? Isn't the tournament about to begin?
Traveler: We know, it's our fault! We're really sorry!
Mavuika: Yeah, we're about to start. I'm here to pick you up.
Mavuika: Put on your helmets, and get on the bike.
Paimon: Huh? Can we make it in time?
Traveler: I'll hang on to you, Paimon, don't worry!
Mavuika: We'll take a shortcut.
Mavuika: Sit down and sit tight. You can hold on to my waist if you get scared.
Traveler: Paimon doesn't count as a passenger, so we're not overloaded!

## Talk 12

Mualani: Woohoo! Annnd SAFE! Just in time, too!
Kachina: We won the bet! We won the bet!
Mualani: That's right! Pay up, Ajaw!
Kachina: Yeah, pay up, Ajaw!
Kinich: Pay up.
Ajaw: Tch! Darn it...
Paimon: Aaaaaah— Oof!
Mavuika: How'd you like that? A short flamestrider show to start us off, and to introduce and welcome Natlan's great friend, "Tum{RUBY#[D]Hope}aini"!
Stadium Audience Member (Audience): Woohoo!!
Ororon: Sure pulled off that stunt pretty neatly.
Citlali: How can you call that a stu— Wait... What do you mean, "pulled it off"? That wasn't supposed to be part of the show?
Mavuika: Everyone, welcome back to the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame. Once more, I will say a few words before we begin.
Mavuika: Bored? Heard it all before? Not to worry. We're doing things differently from now on.
Mavuika: The Abyss no longer threatens us day and night as it once did. My comrades, my friends, thank you for your hard work and sacrifice. We have achieved a lasting victory. A new day has dawned on Natlan!
Stadium Audience Member (Audience): Woooooo!
Mavuika: From now on, the Pilgrimage will no longer serve as the prelude to a war waged to defend our land. However, many aspects of it will remain the same.
Mavuika: It remains a trial to determine the strongest among us, as well as a stage upon which to showcase your individual growth.
Mavuika: Today marks the beginning of yet another legendary saga — one written in the triumphs of the victors! So, without further ado... Let the tournament begin!
Stadium Audience Member (Audience): Yeah!!
Stadium Audience Member (Audience): Heck yeah!! Who's gonna be the new champion!?
Mavuika: Now then, you two. You'll be mobile supervisors, moving with the contestants as they progress, and making sure that everything is proceeding fairly and in good order.
Paimon: Leave it to us! We're the best adventurer and travel guide duo you'll ever meet!
Mavuika: Oh, and one more thing. I believe I've mentioned this already, but...
Mavuika: If you find any leads on Lord Xbalanque, please pass them onto me.
Traveler: Will do.
Mavuika: Thanks. I'm counting on you.

## Talk 13

Paimon: Hey, Kinich! Gonna take part in the tournament?
Kinich: Of course. I wouldn't dream of missing such a rare opportunity.
Paimon: Best of luck! You can do it!
Paimon: Hmm... Where's Ajaw, though?
Kinich: I locked him in a chest. I'm going to win the tournament solely on my own merit, so he's not needed during the competition.
Paimon: Aha! Hmm, on a different note, have you heard anything about Lord Xbalanque?
Kinich: I've looked all over, but haven't seen anyone that struck me as being on his level.
Traveler: Let's touch base again later, then.
Kinich: Sure.
Paimon: Hehe, you're reliable as always, Kinich! We should go check with the others now, so we'll see you later. Good luck, and make sure you don't get injured!
Kinich: Appreciate it. Wish you guys every success as well.

## Talk 14

Paimon: Ooh, hi there, Iansan! Are you gonna participate in the tournament?
Iansan: No, as the designer of this course, that's out of the question.
Iansan: I'm here to cheer everyone on and monitor the pre-event warm-up. Contestants must limber up properly if they don't want to get injured.
Paimon: That's fair. Can we ask you something, then? You know about Lord Xbalanque's resurrection, right? Have you seen anyone with that kind of aura over here?
Iansan: Yeah, the others told me about it.
Iansan: I've kept an eye out, but haven't noticed anything unusual. At least, I haven't seen any contestant whose strength or skill is clearly a cut above the rest.
Paimon: Got it, thank you! We'll keep asking around, then.
Iansan: You're welcome... Wait, one moment!
Paimon: Huh?
Iansan: You warm up as well. You'll be running alongside them in the Stadium, so you've got to go in prepared.
Iansan: Stretch! Lower! Again! Good!
Black Screen Text: Iansan corners you, and coerces the two of you into going through a round of warm-ups. Her coach's aura is simply too commanding to resist.
Iansan: Alright, you're good. You may go.
Paimon: Ah, thank you, Coach... Paimon feels like even her blood is boiling...

## Talk 15

Citlali: Hmm...
Citlali: Hah—!
Paimon: Whoa!!
Citlali: #Oh? Well, hey there, Traveler and Paimon. What brings you here?
Traveler: To see the lovely Miss Itztli.
Citlali: You...! Hmph, I'm not buying what you're selling!
Paimon: #Traveler means it!
Paimon: Still, Paimon didn't think you'd be taking part, Citlali. Given who you are, are you sure it isn't against the rules?
Citlali: Though not a violation per se, what it will be is an unpleasant surprise for the youngsters.
Citlali: Normally, I stay out of this kind of event — don't want to put too much pressure on everyone else. But we're celebrating the end of the war here, so I'll give the occasion the respect it deserves.
Paimon: Good luck, then! Make sure you show off your super-majestic side, alright?
Citlali: Well, aren't you the sweet-talker today? Too much syrup on your pancakes this morning?
Citlali: Anyway, thank you both. I'll remember your words of encouragement, and do my best.
Paimon: So what was that "Hmm... Hah!" thing all about? Some kinda strange ritual?
Citlali: Of course not. I was using my power to search for Lord Xbalanque.
Citlali: To be more precise, I was trying to look for him in the world of souls. After all, I also have no idea what he might look like...
Citlali: But why? He is the first Pyro Archon, after all, isn't it a given that he'll be revived with an unimaginably large amount of power?
Traveler: Seems like we'll have to keep looking.
Paimon: Yeah, we don't have any leads yet... We'll check for leads somewhere else. Good luck, Granny, and take care!
Citlali: Be on your way, now. Oh, and take care of yourselves, too. Granny Itztli will display her dashing self on the competition grounds soon enough.

## Talk 16

Kachina: One, two, three four, two, two, three four...
Paimon: How's the warm-up going, Kachina? Feeling good?
Kachina: Oh, hey you two! Yeah, I'm feeling great! Ready to get out there and show 'em who's boss, hehe!
Traveler: Good luck! Bring it home.
Kachina: Mhm! I'll give it my all!
Kachina: I mean, I don't know if I'll be able to win again, but as long as I learn something from the experience, that's enough of a win for me!
Paimon: Yeah, having the right mindset is everything!
Kachina: Yup!
Paimon: Oh, by the way, have you seen anyone who seems like Lord Xbalanque?
Kachina: Lord Xbalanque? Hmm... I don't think so!
Kachina: A powerful figure like him is sure to attract attention wherever he goes. Like Mualani and Kinich — only even more so.
Kachina: I haven't seen anyone like that, though... So he probably hasn't passed this way.
Paimon: Ahh, alright... Thanks, Kachina! We'll go take another look around. Focus on taking care of yourself as well as winning!
Kachina: I will, thank you!

## Talk 17

Paimon: We're back!
Mavuika: Supervisors, your report, please. How are the contestants doing?
Paimon: Madam host, the contestants are doing great, and the competition is proceeding as scheduled!
Paimon: However, when it comes to Xbalanque...
Mavuika: No leads, huh... The competition is almost about to begin, and there's still no sign of him?
Paimon: Not what you expected?
Mavuika: ...
Mavuika: Not necessarily.
Mavuika: Still, let's go give everyone a warm welcome before we kick off.

## Talk 18

Mavuika: I believe we're all warmed up. Now, take your positions.
Mavuika: This iteration of the Pilgrimage is the perfect chance for us to bid farewell to the past. Now, go forth and soar, faster, higher, stronger — become a better version of yourself.
Mavuika: Remember what brought you here, and keep pushing forward. This tournament begins... now!
Mualani: Alright! Ready or not, here I come!
Fighter A (Contestant): Waaah!!!
Balam: There's Mualani, a natural sports star! She's not going to stop scoring anytime soon!
Mualani: I've got this!
Mualani: This round's in the bag!
Kinich: A vertical course, huh...
Kinich: Time to leave them all in the dust.
Balam: Kinich is coming up to the trickiest parts of the course here, but is he slowing down? NO! He's SPEEDING UP! Amazing!
Fighter B (Contestant): How's he so fast!?
Kinich: See you later.
Balam: The gap between our competitors has increased significantly! Could this mean...
Kachina: Hah!
Balam: Ooh! Contestant Kachina has suddenly appeared from the side!
Kachina: This part's rough... but I won't give up!
Citlali: Ugh! So annoying...
Balam: The competition has entered its final phase! Who will emerge victorious? We're about to find out!
Kinich: Got you!
Nlteego: Aghhh!
Kinich: Well? Do you yield?
Nlteego: I... I...
Kinich: ...
Nlteego: *sigh* I yield!
Mavuika: Our champion has emerged! And his name is... Kinich!
Ecstatic Audience Members (Audience): Kinich! Kinich!
Mualani: That's amazing! Woohoo!
Kachina: Yeah, that's our Kinich! I knew he'd win!
Ajaw: What!? So not only is the little punk hard to kill, but he's good at fighting too? Hmph. Guess he does have some skill...
Nlteego: You beat me fair and square, Kinich... People always talk about how tough you are, and now I can say for sure: they're not exaggerating.
Nlteego: It's funny, I was thinking to myself earlier that I might have a shot at winning this... unless I have to face Kinich in the final.
Ecstatic Audience Members (Audience): Come on, dude! What are you talking about?
Engrossed Audience Member (Audience): Pfft, losing to Kinich isn't really a loss at all!
Overexcited Audience Member (Audience): You've more than proven yourself, too! You could beat me up thirty times over!
Kinich: Ha. Hear that? They're recognizing your strength as well.
Kinich: Keep up the good work. Let's have a rematch sometime.
Nlteego: Yeah!
Paimon: They're both so good... But wait, if that's the end, where's Xbalanque?
Citlali: Wait, aren't we missing someone? Ah! Lord Xbalanque!
Mualani: Now that you mention it... Where is he? Don't tell me...
Kachina: ...
Kinich: What's with the looks on your faces? I might have won, but I'm not Xbalanque.
Ajaw: Huh!? Are you saying that you BEAT Xbalanque, then? Urgh, just kill me now! Better death than to suffer this torture! What a joke!
Iansan: Hmm. You might be onto something... I've never met our runner-up before. So... Where did you get this good?
Ecstatic Audience Members (Audience): That's impossible, right? Could he have placed so well because of some connection with Lord Xbalanque?
Chasca: You mean... He might be Xbalanque?
Nlteego: Wait, I'm Xbalanque now? Heh, that's news to me.
Engrossed Audience Member (Audience): I've got it! Lord Xbalanque didn't want to steal anyone's thunder, so he must've lost the tournament on purpose!
Ecstatic Audience Members (Audience): Wait, that doesn't make any sense. This is the most holy Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame! How could anyone throw a match?
Paimon: Whoa, did Paimon say something wrong? Now everyone's talking about Xbalanque...
Paimon: Still, that guy was almost too good, wasn't he? We've never heard of him before, but he was still going toe to toe with Kinich. Could he really be...?
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Huh? What are you looking at, Mavuika?
Mavuika: I've felt that something was off since the tournament began.
Mavuika: Reflecting back on it, it wasn't because I could sense Xbalanque's power, but rather that... I could not.
Traveler: (Does she mean that Xbalanque is not present? Or... does she mean that he wasn't resurrected in his original form?)
Mavuika: Please, excuse me.
Iansan: Wait, she's going... straight in the direction of the other contestants?
Mavuika: ...
Mavuika: There you are.
Xbalanque (???): ...
Mavuika: No unimaginably strong soul aura, nor any whiff of extraordinary power...
Mavuika: But I know, beyond any doubt, that you are Xbalanque himself.
Xbalanque (???): ...
Overexcited Audience Member (Audience): Huuuuuuh!?
Ecstatic Audience Members (Audience): Wh—Who's that? I've never seen him before...
Engrossed Audience Member (Audience): Isn't that Mausau? Like, Tawto's grandson? When did he sign up for the tournament? Did he even fight anyone out on the field?
Overexcited Audience Member (Audience): What are you talking about? He's been standing there this whole time. I totally thought he was just there to cheer the others on...
Kachina: Wait, so THAT'S Xbalanque? But... he's just a kid...
Xbalanque (???): Ahem...
Ajaw: Hah! HA! Well, this kid doesn't look like he can take a single punch from the Almighty Dragonlord, K'uhul Ajaw! Just give me one second, and I'll...
Nlteego: Huh? That's Lord Xbalanque? But... I mean, he was right next to me for most of the tournament. And he didn't seem very, well... Xbalanque to me...
Xbalanque (???): ...You recognized me? Perceptive. No less than expected of this era's Pyro Archon.
Mavuika: Forgive me for asking, but how did you do in the latest tournament?
Xbalanque (???): Haha, I didn't even make it to the final 32.
Ecstatic Audience Members (Audience): Noooooo!
Overexcited Audience Member (Audience): This is a joke, right? It has to be! It's clearly staged!
Engrossed Audience Member (Audience): Out of my way! I've got to see Lord Xbalanque for myself!
Mavuika: As expected, your return has caused quite the commotion.
Iansan: Less talking, more doing! Hurry up and take Lord Xbalanque to a safe place. I've got this place covered.
Mavuika: Please remain calm, everyone. Lord Xbalanque is one of the most important people in all of Natlan. I will take responsibility for receiving him into our midst.
Iansan: You heard the Archon! Just leave this to her. Don't worry, we'll let you know as soon as we know more!
Traveler: (Mavuika seems to be signaling Paimon and I to follow her...?)
Paimon: Ah, she's calling us! Quick, let's go!
Paimon: Hey! Wait up!

## Talk 19

Mavuika: Thank you for agreeing to be my opponent.
