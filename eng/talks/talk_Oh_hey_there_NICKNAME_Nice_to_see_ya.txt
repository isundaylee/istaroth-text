Dehya: #Oh, hey there, {NICKNAME}. Nice to see ya!
Traveler: Didn't expect to see you here at this hour, Dehya.
Dehya: Hahaha, well, Cyno's out of the country on a trip, so he got me to come and help his subordinates take care of a few things. I guess you could say I'm his temporary substitute.
Dehya: The atmosphere around here's not too bad nowadays, so I don't mind sticking around once in a while.
Dehya: You've probably got a lot going on yourself, I'll bet? Good luck with everything!
