Sethos: We're free agents now, right? Great. Well, I think I'll stick around here for a bit, you wanna join me?
Sethos: Hmm... Actually, this is a pretty nice place. If I brought some of my people here, I'm sure the kids would enjoy playing hide-and-seek.
Sethos: ...There must be quite a story behind this place. It's so vast and mysterious.

Sethos: You know how merchants in a hurry sometimes dangle a little food in front of their Sumpter Beast's face, right? To get them to move faster?
Sethos: I think people are the same way. Give them a little hope, and they can achieve a whole lot more. Take their hope away, and they never seem to succeed.
Sethos: So, I'll explore this place with you to the end. Let's never stop hoping for victory.

Sethos: Kay, I've brought water and some rations. Later on, we can build a fire and grill some meat.
Sethos: Hmm? You think we should be safe enough here?
Sethos: Haha, well yeah, I know! That's why I figured this would be a great place for a picnic. The battles are important, but we should take some time to relax first.
