Traveler: Well, isn't the commission complete?
Etsuko: Yes. Which is why I'm over here slacking off in the Guild's name, see?
Etsuko: I wouldn't dare hang around here doing nothing otherwise.
Etsuko: To tell you the truth, though, this place is still very concerning.
Etsuko: "Asase Shrine," "Hibiki"... and of course, "Domeki."
Etsuko: I just feel that many heretofore undiscovered secrets still lie buried here on Seirai Island.
Etsuko: That said... Heh, I'm too lazy to figure them all out myself.
Etsuko: Once we get back to the Guild, I'll settle those reports, and we'll leave it to them to figure out a larger schema for exploring Seirai Island.
Etsuko: But before that... let me just slack here for a while more.
