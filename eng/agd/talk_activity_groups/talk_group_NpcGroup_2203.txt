Landa: It seems that these strange meteorites have also appeared in Liyue, just as they have in Mondstadt...
Landa: How may I help you? I mean, I'm just a merchant from Mondstadt who's in the wine business...

Traveler: Adventure Challenge

Landa: Thank you! Your skills are an inspiration. Now I know how to deal with... difficult people...

## Talk

Landa: Ah! I miscalculated. But that won't happen again!

Landa: This is really bad...
Traveler: What happened to you?
Landa: Oh, you're a traveler... Well, you see, I'm a merchant, and I often shuttle between Mondstadt and Liyue on business.
Landa: I had just closed a big deal in Mondstadt, and was getting ready to deliver the invoices back to my boss...
Landa: But I never imagined that I'd be attacked by monsters while passing through this area.
Landa: I couldn't fight them off, so I could only flee for my life, and ended up stumbling my way into this inn.
Landa: But I've run off, and left all the invoices behind... Could I ask you to get them back for me?
Traveler: I've got this.
Landa: That's wonderful! I remember the places I passed by as I ran, more or less. Here, let me mark them for you...
Landa: I placed all the invoices inside a box. It shouldn't be too hard to find, so please, help me out!
Traveler: What sort of invoices?
Landa: For wine, of course. What other business would one do in Mondstadt, anyway?
Landa: This is a huge deal. If anything goes wrong, my boss will hang the loss on me for sure.
Landa: Please help me out. I've marked all the rough locations out for you.
Landa: I placed all the invoices inside a box. It shouldn't be too hard to find, so please, help me out!
Traveler: Who's your boss?
Landa: My boss? Uh, well, it's a really rich merchant in Liyue. Really rich.
Landa: Oh, just don't ask too much. I'm just the errand runner, I don't know that much about the boss.
Landa: But if I mess this one up, I'm going to lose this errand-running job for sure.
Landa: Please help me out. I've marked all the rough locations out for you.
Landa: I placed all the invoices inside a box. It shouldn't be too hard to find, so please, help me out!

Landa: Can I help you? As you can see I'm a merchant from Mondstadt — so in the wine business, of course!
Landa: ...Wh—Why are you looking at me like that. I'm telling the truth, I swear...

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Landa: My name is Landa, and I'm in the wine business. That girl darting about all over the show is my daughter, Tia.
Landa: Did you know that all of Mondstadt's wine exports go via Liyue before being distributed to the rest of the continent?
Landa: And have you heard of the Morn Winery? That's where it comes from.
Landa: ...Sorry yes, Dawn Winery. Not Morn. Dawn.
Traveler: ...No true child of Mondstadt would make that mistake.
Landa: Give me a break, I just haven't been back to Mondstadt in forever is all.
Landa: Meanwhile, I've gotten to know this place like the back of my hand. I've traveled this route on business more times than I can remember.
Landa: Both the innkeeper and the boss of this place will vouch for me on that!
Landa: Isn't that right, Huai'an? Goldet? Hahahaha...
Landa: ...Come on, don't leave me hanging now...
Traveler: You get cuter each time you open your mouth.
Landa: ...What a strange thing to say.
Landa: Anyway, you want to hear a secret that only someone in the wine business could tell you?
Landa: "Angel's Share" actually used to be wine brewers' slang before it was the name of a tavern.
Landa: The idea was that the air bubbles you see during fermentation carry away the angel's share when they float off into the wind.
Landa: Not bad huh? Vintage Mondstadt knowledge!

Traveler: Whatever you say, I have to go.
Landa: What's that supposed to mean? I'm telling the truth!
Landa: Next time you see me re-stocking in Mondstadt, you'll know I'm the real deal!
