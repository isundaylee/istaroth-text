# In the Name of the Resistance


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hey, look! D'you think that's a resistance fighter?
Paimon: Looks like he's in a tight spot... Let's go help him out!

## Talk 2

Tokuda: *coughing* ...Is this a new recruit?
Masashi: Looks like a strong addition to the troop... Hopefully someone I can spar with after I've recovered.
Tokuda: Whoa, whoa, brand new recruit and your first thought is to start sparring with them? You're getting ahead of yourself. That wound of yours isn't something that's gonna clear up in a few days.
Tokuda: Teppei, did you bring this one in? How are things on the front line?
Teppei: Aha, well... the enemy are much stronger than we could've imagined, but we're holding our own... I've been right in the thick of it.
Teppei: At one point, there were a horde of enemy troops surging towards us like the tide... but I didn't flinch. I drew my blade and charged straight into the fray! Four Shogunate Samurai, and only one of me — but I still managed to fend them off.
Masashi: Look at you! When did you grow nerves of steel?
Teppei: #This {F#lady}{M#guy} stole the show, though. When {F#she}{M#he} saw me tiring and falling back, {F#she}{M#he} burst onto the scene and took down a whole group of them in one fell swoop! They were no match for {F#her}{M#him} at all.
Teppei: #I heard {F#she}{M#he} even stormed the Vision Hunt Ceremony... and that the Raiden Shogun herself failed to take {F#her}{M#him} down!
Tokuda: Amazing work, both of you.
Tokuda: #Still, uh... I can believe most of that, but {F#her}{M#him} facing off against the Raiden Shogun? I think you might be embellishing the story a little there, Teppei... I mean, we've all heard of the Musou no Hitotachi, right? Haha.
Tokuda: *sigh* Either way, to tell the truth, with all the losses we've sustained recently, I was starting to lose hope in our ability to hold out much longer.
Tokuda: But seeing fresh recruits join our ranks and hearing Teppei's exploits... I'm itching to get myself better as soon as possible, so I can get back out on the front line.
Masashi: Huh, that's a lukewarm epiphany if you ask me. While you're lying there itching to get better, I'm still out there training hard despite my injury... even though it burst open again yesterday...
Teppei: It did? Well, do you need me to get you something to dress it with?
Teppei: I heard about a remedy recently that uses wild bugs. All you need to do is grind Onikabuto into powder, and it makes a very effective dressing.
Teppei: They say it feels cool on the skin and acts fast to completely cure flesh wounds.
Masashi: Sure, I'll take one! Thanks!
Tokuda: Hmm, sounds a little strange to me... I would've thought Wolfhooks would do the trick, but it's your decision.
Teppei: Well, how about we let our new recruit decide? I'll stay here and make some preparations...
Teppei: If you're a fan of weird and wonderful remedies, please gather some Onikabuto for me. I'll take it from there.
Teppei: But if you're more of a Wolfhook advocate, bring some of those instead. Personally, I recommend we try the new remedy — it sounds promising!

## Talk 3

Teppei: Well, we managed to hold them off... But what would the Shogun's Army be doing here?
Teppei: We have sentries and patrols posted all around the perimeter here. The enemy should never have been able to reach us this far unnoticed.
Teppei: Unless... we have a traitor in our midst.
Teppei: They must have an informant feeding them intelligence and helping them to approach unseen. That's the only possible explanation.
Teppei: Our priority is finding the agent and protecting the camp. This is my chance to show what I'm made of!
Message-Runner: Sir, if I may...
Message-Runner: I just returned from inspecting the perimeter. It appears that several portions of our defensive walls were already collapsed.
Message-Runner: The Shogun's Army must have known about this vulnerability and made their way over from the cliffs nearby, before attacking through the gaps in our defenses.
Message-Runner: I suggest we repair the walls and double the guard. That should keep them from sneaking up on us like this again.
Teppei: In that case... Understood, leave the repairs to us. We can make use of the wood and rope nearby to patch up the defenses.
Teppei: Why don't we make this more interesting, recruit! A contest between the two of us. Just don't underestimate me, haha! If there's anything I know, it's logistics, you'll see!

## Talk 4

Kujou Sara: Remove all threats to Eternity — by order of the Almighty Shogun.
Gorou: Be wary, you're up against a powerful opponent.

## Talk 5

Teppei: You can take 'em!
Paimon: There's more than one round! Keep it up!

## Talk 6

Teppei: Well, there you have it. I told you our latest recruit is pretty strong.
Shouji: Incredible! I think I understand what I was doing wrong now.
Shouji: My posture was off and I didn't draw back with enough force. Seems I also need to focus on keeping my grip steady and monitoring the external environment. If I can get those few down, I'll be hitting my mark in no time!
Hisahiko: Those "few," huh?
Hisahiko: Watching your demonstration was a great help. I learned a lot.
Hisahiko: At least this time I was able to observe some proper technique. As long as I can retain it, I know I'll become much stronger.
Hisahiko: Honestly, before this whole conflict came about, I was just another everyday citizen of Watatsumi Island.
Hisahiko: My wife and I were leading a quiet life together. War and battles were the last things on our minds. That all changed with the Vision Hunt Decree...
Hisahiko: The actions of the Shogun's Army ignited something inside me — that's why I joined the resistance. The road ahead of us now seems like a long one indeed.
Hisahiko: Can those of us without Visions or combat skills really become adept fighters like them...?
Hisahiko: ...There's no use in speculating. Thank you both for your help, we'll keep practicing as much as we can.
Teppei: Stay focused. With us holding the front line, you can continue sharpening your skills until you're ready.
Teppei: Now then, let me show you around some other places.
Teppei: Where should we head next...
Message-Runner: Sir! We've got trouble! The Shogun's Army is attacking!
Message-Runner: There are still many wounded in the camp — we mustn't let the enemy break through! We'll need your help to hold them off!
Teppei: What? Impossible! How could they have reached us all the way out here...
Teppei: We'd better go assess the situation. A chance for us to prove our worth in battle!

## Talk 7

Teppei: Oh...
Teppei: Never mind, I guess this was probably the safer option.
Teppei: I may need your help in a moment to change their dressings. Here's hoping this'll speed up their recovery.
Teppei: And, uh, thanks for your help gathering the ingredients.
Tokuda: *grimace* ...This really hurts when you first put it on.
Tokuda: It's a standard remedy, but a dependable one. More importantly, thanks for the fresh dressing — much appreciated.
Masashi: Hmm... You may have skimped a little here though. I feel like I could use some more!
Masashi: I'm dying to get out of this place! I just want to be back on the battlefield, with you!
Tokuda: I don't think it works like that... Piling on extra dressing isn't going to make you heal faster. Especially not when you're sneaking off to go train in the middle of the night! You have to cut that out, you know...
Tokuda: Thanks again, Teppei... and thanks to our new recruit here.
Tokuda: Speaking of training, that reminds me — they should be doing some archery practice down at the training grounds right now. Why don't you take our new recruit to go check it out?
Tokuda: It'll be a good chance for them to meet a few more of our platoon and settle in.
Teppei: You got it! Alright, let's move out.

## Talk 8

Teppei: Thanks for your help! Have you decided which dressing to use yet?

## Talk 9

Shouji: *sigh* Another miss. This sucks...
Shouji: Let's see now... I've loosed exactly ten arrows, and only one—
Hisahiko: Bullseye?
Shouji: ...Only one hit the target.
Hisahiko: *sigh* This isn't good enough. It's evident from these past few days that practice alone isn't enough to improve our marksmanship.
Hisahiko: How hard could it be? Just draw the bow, aim, and shoot. Clearly I underestimated the skill involved...
Hisahiko: With progress like this, who knows when we'll be fit for battle. I suppose all we can do for now is wait for the drillmaster's next visit and ask him for more tips.
Shouji: Seems things have gotten tough on the front line recently. All the best drillmasters have already been dispatched to fight.
Shouji: I guess we'll just have to keep practicing ourselves. *sigh* At this rate, who knows if we'll ever become resistance fighters...
Teppei: C'mon guys! Less complaining, more training...
Shouji: ...Teppei senpai?
Teppei: Listen up for a second. I've come to introduce our newest recruit.
Teppei: #In battle, {F#she}{M#he} single-handedly slayed multiple Shogunate Samurai without so much as breaking a sweat.
Teppei: And that was after interrupting the Vision Hunt Ceremony with a feat of stunning bravery, not to mention surviving an encounter with the Raiden Shogun!
Shouji: I—Is that true...? Uh... p—perhaps you'd be willing to give us some... archery tips?
Shouji: We promise not to take too much of your time. A quick demonstration would be all we need. Our previous training was so rushed that we hardly remember the proper technique.
Hisahiko: It would mean a lot!
Traveler: Okay, but watch closely.
Shouji: Oh! Y—You got it! We won't let you down.
Traveler: Sure, but pay attention this time.

## Talk 10

Teppei: Alright! I knew you'd back me on this!
Teppei: I can't guarantee it'll work, but if it does, everyone will be fighting fit again in no time.
Teppei: Why don't you hand me the ingredients — it's a bit of a chore to prepare, so I'll take it from here.
Tokuda: *grimace* Ow, ow, ow...
Tokuda: ...Huh? Just like that, the pain's stopped. Now it just feels numb...
Masashi: Looks like this might actually work. Not bad, Teppei! As soon as I'm better, we'll have to do some serious sparring together to make up for lost time.
Tokuda: Sparring? You have a one track mind, seriously... But good going, Teppei.
Tokuda: When you first applied it, it felt like you were rubbing salt into the wound. But then the pain disappeared and there was just a cool sensation. I swear I can feel my body repairing itself already... Still... I better not start overdoing it quite yet.
Tokuda: I swear I can feel my body repairing itself already... Still... I better not start overdoing it quite yet.
Tokuda: Thanks to both of you for looking after us so well. The day I'm discharged, drinks are on me.
Teppei: Hehe, just glad we were able to help. Alright, I'm gonna continue giving our new recruit the grand tour. Rest up, you guys.
Masashi: Don't forget to visit the training grounds! Get some practice in before you hit the front line!
Tokuda: *sigh* Calm down and get some rest...
Teppei: The training grounds... That reminds me, they should be doing archery training over there right now. Let's head over.

## Talk 11

Gorou: Look! That's two rounds in a row!
Gorou: The Shogun's Army is not invincible! We can win!
Gorou: The soldiers are rallying... Your warrior's will is bringing them hope, Traveler...

## Talk 12

Kujou Sara: Stronger than I anticipated... This contest has served its purpose.
Kujou Sara: Soldiers, attack!
Kujou Sara: Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!
Gorou: Prepare to engage!
Gorou: All of you, with me!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: #Greetings, Traveler. This is the first time we've met, please allow me to introduce myself.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I am Sangonomiya Kokomi, organizer of the resistance, and also the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Perhaps it's the first time you're hearing that title... To put it simply, I'm the person currently in charge on Watatsumi Island, which is also the home front of the resistance.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I've actually heard all about you from Beidou and Kazuha. I hadn't expected to find you'd joined the resistance, though.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Do you have a plan beyond this point?
Traveler: No immediate plans...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Mm... in that case, shall we continue our conversation at the shrine of Sangonomiya?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Although the Shogun's Army has retreated for now, the war is far from over.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The Vision Hunt Decree has not been repealed, and neither the Tenryou Commission nor the Raiden Shogun show any sign of stopping... In short, our problems have yet to be resolved.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I suggest we move to the shrine to discuss our counter-plan. What say you?
Traveler: Sure.
Teppei: Um... Can I come, too?
Teppei: I know Watatsumi Island very well. I can carry on being your guide, if you'd like.
Traveler: Of course you can come.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Gorou, thank you for all you have done.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Our forces are weaker than the Shogun's Army, and my absence can only have made the recent days all the more trying for you.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I'm afraid I must still ask you to stay a while longer, to keep eyes on the Shogun's Army and also to see to the wounded. Mm... But I will ask the mercenaries to remain stationed here, and Kazuha is here too. Hopefully, this will serve to reduce the pressure you are under.
Gorou: Well received, Your Excellency!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: #...I must return to Sangonomiya now, I have a few things to attend to... Once you're ready, Traveler, please rendezvous with Teppei. He will escort you there.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Thank you for all your efforts so far. From this day on, I fight alongside you.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Fight... for the future of Inazuma.

## Talk 13

Paimon: Wh—Why have we stopped here?
Thoma: In case you've forgotten, the Komore Teahouse is the safest place for me to hide in this area.
Thoma: The only thing is, I probably won't be able to leave again for some time. I'll have to leave the next steps to you.
Traveler: What do you need us to do?
Thoma: Go to Tatarasuna and find the resistance.
Thoma: The Shogun's Army is almost certainly about to issue a warrant for our arrest. There are very few parties that will be willing to shelter us... but the resistance is an exception.
Paimon: Paimon's pretty sure Ayaka mentioned them before... Oh yeah! Sangonomiya's group! The ones who came together to fight the Vision Hunt Decree!
Thoma: That's right. The resistance was founded by Sangonomiya Kokomi, the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island. Currently, it's her subordinate, Gorou, who leads them in their war against the Shogun's Army.
Thoma: However, the Yashiro Commission is not on especially close terms with the resistance. So your dealings with us would normally be frowned upon.
Thoma: But you're different, so that shouldn't work against you... As far as I can see, the resistance shouldn't have any reason to turn you away.
Thoma: The only issue is that we can't be sure of the resistance forces' current location. You'll have to ask around along the way.
Thoma: You'll likely pass through territory occupied by the Shogun's Army at some point. So, be sure to stay on your guard at all times.
Traveler: Be sure you do the same.
Thoma: Don't worry about me, I can remain hidden when I want to. I won't make it easy for them.
Paimon: We gotta hurry up, the Tenryou Commission could be right around the corner!
Paimon: Let's get outta here!
Traveler: I should head off right away.
Thoma: Me too, well, I should probably head inside the teahouse now. I'll see you when I see you, whenever that is... In the meantime, stay safe.

## Talk 14

Sakamoto: Oh, hey. You managed to escape too?
Jiichirou: Yeah. Where are you headed?
Sakamoto: Higi Village. I've heard the rumors, but it's still gotta be a safer place than a warzone.
Sakamoto: What about you?
Jiichirou: Ugh, don't get me started. I was recuperating on Nazuchi Beach — it's complete chaos over there.
Jiichirou: The resistance aren't having an easy time of it. They don't have the manpower for an all-out confrontation, so they can't contend with the Shogun's Army.
Jiichirou: The front line used to be further forward, but they had to retreat a couple of times. Now they're back to Nazuchi Beach.
Jiichirou: That's where I've just come from — I was lucky to get out. It's much too dangerous... their forces are so scattered that no one knows who's who, and anyone you run into pulls their weapon... I just dropped my luggage and ran here.
Jiichirou: I think we need to keep moving — things are changing so fast. The further away we can get, the better.
Sakamoto: Agreed... Why don't we stick together? Can't hurt to team up with someone.
Paimon: Nazuchi Beach... Sounds like that's where the resistance and the Shogun's Army are battling it out right now. Let's head over and take a look.

## Talk 15

Takayama: *yawn* ...I heard they added a couple more people to the wanted list. They're high-priority targets, apparently.
Ishihara: But most of our forces are out on the front line. How are we supposed to effectively prioritize them? We'll just have to make sure we keep our eyes peeled when we're out on patrol.
Takayama: *sigh* I wonder how they're faring on the front line.
Takayama: The last thing I heard was that we'd pushed the resistance back to just northwest of Musoujin Gorge. I don't know if that's true.
Ishihara: I doubt it. Their rearguard isn't far from there. We're gaining ground at the moment, but I don't think we've pushed them back that far.
Ishihara: Anyway, we should focus on patrol. Come on, we're up.
Takayama: Eh, fair point... *sigh* Time to go to work.
Paimon: The northwest of Musoujin Gorge... So that's where the resistance forces are based. We should keep asking around though, just to be safe.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Beidou: I guarantee you, only the Alcor could pull off an ambush as quietly as that.
Beidou: Did we give you a fright? I gotta admit, I was caught off guard myself. When we dropped you off in Ritou, I wasn't expecting Tatarasuna would be the next place I'd see you.
Beidou: But wherever you might end up, you'll always be part of Captain Beidou's crew.
Beidou: If you're ever in a tight spot, come and find me. I'll have your back.

### Additional Talk 2

Kaedehara Kazuha: On the way here, I happened to learn of the bounty on your head. Hehe, as expected, you seem to have given them quite the challenge in that regard.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I hear also that you witnessed the Raiden Shogun? I trust she's as oppressive as ever.
Kaedehara Kazuha: The Musou no Hitotachi... Are there truly those who can withstand it?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Perhaps one day, we will be able to face her oppression head-on... This is the reason I returned to Inazuma.

### Additional Talk 3

Gorou: Her Excellency never fails us!
Gorou: I must say, I was certainly surprised to look out and see Kazuha joining the fray. It's been quite some time since we last fought side-by-side...
Gorou: At that time, his friend was defeated in a duel before the throne... and executed by the Raiden Shogun. Kazuha came to visit the resistance as he was fleeing Inazuma with his friend's Vision.
Gorou: ...Hard to believe it's been so long.

### Additional Talk 4

Teppei: Alright, that should do it. The Shogun's Army will have a hard time getting past this, no matter how determined they are!
Teppei: It seems I've made another valuable contribution to the resistance... But why does it always have to be logistics work!
Teppei: I thought getting transferred to the front line would be a chance to showcase my abilities and square off with the enemy. Instead, here I am doing what I've always done before.
Paimon: Why are you so insistent about being on the front line?
Teppei: It's just like General Gorou said, we joined the resistance because of our warrior's will.
Teppei: There are a multitude of ways to contribute to the resistance, but who wouldn't want to take out a few Shogunate Samurai, given the chance?
Teppei: Anyway, we got more than we bargained for inspecting the camp! Let's report back to General Gorou.
Teppei: If all goes well, we might just be assigned a few missions closer to the action!

### Additional Talk 5

Tokuda: I wonder when I'll finally be back on the front line...
Masashi: No one wants the Vision Hunt Decree. The resistance will be victorious!

### Additional Talk 6

Tokuda: I wonder when I'll finally be back on the front line...
Masashi: No one wants the Vision Hunt Decree. The resistance will be victorious!

### Additional Talk 7

Teppei: Aha, pressure getting to you?
Teppei: That's no way to demonstrate. Come on, try again.
Teppei: Let's go — show us what you got!

### Additional Talk 8

Teppei: Ready?
Teppei: I'm sure you'll get it this time. Swiftly, now!
