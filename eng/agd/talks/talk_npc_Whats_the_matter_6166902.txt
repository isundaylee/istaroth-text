Traveler: What's the matter?
Stevens: Well, here's how it is: I'm a researcher specializing in ancient history...
Stevens: Thanks to Ms. Iris, I received and read a truly enlightening document recently.
Stevens: She found it here on Dragonspine, and I believe that the mountain must be home to more lost texts...
Stevens: If we had more of them, I would definitely make progress in my research.
Stevens: Never mind weapons or ancient currency, these texts are the true treasure here!
