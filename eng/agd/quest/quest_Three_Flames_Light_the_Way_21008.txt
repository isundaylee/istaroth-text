# Three Flames Light the Way


## Talk 1

Xinghuo: How have the torches gone out again...
Traveler: What's wrong with the torches?
Xinghuo: Ah, traveler. Look ahead, can you see three watchtowers? The torches on them should all be lit...
Xinghuo: The roads along Guili Plains can be difficult to traverse at the best of times, worse still when there are monsters out there in hiding. The torches aren't just to light the way for travelers, they also indicate that there is no threat from monsters.
Xinghuo: But... I was so busy clearing out monsters in the area that I completely forgot to stoke the fires. By the time I realized it was too late, and they'd all gone out.

## Talk 2

Traveler: Why can't you do it?
Xinghuo: Ah, it's 'cause they come to check the fires. If it's me here, I can buy a bit more time.
Xinghuo: It's no good if you stand here or if there's no-one here at all.
Xinghuo: So please, traveler, go and light the torches for me!

## Talk 3

Traveler: Alright, I'll light them for you.
Xinghuo: That would be great. Thank you!
Xinghuo: Along this road there are three watchtowers, each with their own torch. After you've lit them all, make sure to come back and see me again, okay?
Xinghuo: At the end of the road, there is a Statue of The Seven. Perhaps while you are down that way you can visit it, perhaps receive the blessings of the Geo Lord.
Xinghuo: It may be easy but it still needs doing â€” so thank you, and please don't forget.

## Talk 4

Xinghuo: Please traveler, get the fires lit soon. The inspector could be here at any moment!

## Talk 5

Traveler: Tell me more about the road.
Xinghuo: Guili Plains sits atop a range of rock formations, so some areas are a bit more rugged, like the slope heading towards the watchtower west of here.
Xinghuo: To the east, towards the sea is quite flat, however. If you have the time you should head that way and check out Yaoguang Shoal.

## Talk 6

Traveler: What about your colleagues?
Xinghuo: So they look after fueling the fires, while it's my responsibility to get them lit.
Xinghuo: Sure it sounds trivial, but it's important that we each perform our role.

## Talk 7

Xinghuo: Phew... Alright, we should be all good now! Thanks for your help.
Xinghuo: This is for you, to say thanks.
