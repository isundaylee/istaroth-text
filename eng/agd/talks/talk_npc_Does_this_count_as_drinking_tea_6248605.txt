Traveler: Does this count as drinking tea?
Hermanson: Frankly speaking, this may not be the best way for those who are serious about tea.
Hermanson: After all, the cloth and the paper bags will carry flavor all their own, which might affect the flavor of the tea in turn.
Hermanson: Grinding the tea leaves too finely might also have an impact on the flavor.
Hermanson: We'll just have to keep trying to improve the paper or the cloth bags to minimize the aforementioned influence they might have.
