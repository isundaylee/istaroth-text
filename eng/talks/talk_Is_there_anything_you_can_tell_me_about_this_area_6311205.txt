Traveler: Is there anything you can tell me about this area?
Matsudaira: What? Are you still thinking of traveling around here even though you know there's a war going on? You've really got guts...
Matsudaira: As you can see, Kannazuka is the location of the Shogunate camp. It's run by the Kujou Clan of the Tenryou Commission.
Matsudaira: Southwest of Kannazuka is Tatarasuna. Jade Steel, Inazuma's pride and joy, is produced there. However, there was an accident at the Mikage Furnace recently, so you probably should find a detour.
Matsudaira: If you keep heading west, you'll find yourself on Yashiori Island. That's where the rebel camp is. I've heard that those scoundrels were trying to hire more men. Don't you get taken in by them!
Matsudaira: Yashiori Island also contains the corpses of slain gods and demons. It's got that spectacular valley created by the Electro Archon with her serpent-slaying sword going for it, though! So if you do really travel there, you have to go pay that place a visit.
Matsudaira: I've heard about the Tatarigami running amok near those remains, though, so it's better that you don't go there!
