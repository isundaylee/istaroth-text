Guanhai: *sigh* I went out earlier than usual today, and I still missed the boat...
Guanhai: Also, is it just me, or is this year's Lantern Rite busier than usual?

Traveler: Are you alright?
Guanhai: Me? Oh nothing, other than the fact that I work on a ship. That ship that's just set sail to be precise...
Guanhai: Getting up so early in the morning is my biggest hurdle. I never seem to get enough sleep.
Guanhai: I mean when there's so much to go out and do at night, how can anyone expect me to sleep!? Haha, no way. That whole "early to bed, early to rise" lifestyle... I'd rather be dead.
Guanhai: Ahh... Seems the captain has forgotten about me for today. Guess I'll have to try harder to be up earlier tomorrow.

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Guanhai: Yeah, that... With Rex Lapis gone, could that mean the end for Liyue?
Guanhai: Whenever I think about it, I just lose all my drive. I can't work, I get lost in my thoughts... I just can't snap out of it.
Guanhai: What? What do you mean I was already like that?
Guanhai: Huh... Guess in that case I've already sunk about as low as one can go...
Guanhai: Yep...
Guanhai: Awesome.

## Talk 1

Guanhai: Hello there, friend! Are you here to enjoy the night air as well?
Guanhai: I mean, look at all those lanterns. Really makes a guy want to play some cards!
Guanhai: Speaking of which, wanna go for a round with me?

### Talk 1 related talk 0

Traveler: I dunno how to play...
Guanhai: Really? You're missing out on all the fun!
Guanhai: At least you know to head outside and look for it though aye!
Guanhai: Play some cards, listen to some music, experience the nightlife of Liyue. It's only in this moment that I truly feel like I'm living life, you know?
Guanhai: I'm living life, but what're you doing exactly?

## Talk 9

Guanhai: Wow... The Mingxiao Lantern is really taking shape!
Guanhai: I've always loved Lantern Rite, ever since I was a kid. I never dreamed one day I'd be helping to build the actual Mingxiao Lantern!
Guanhai: I must get back to work. If I met myself as kid right now, he'd be so angry at me for slacking off on this... Tee-hee!
