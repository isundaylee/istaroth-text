# Permit to the Sacred Heart

An unadorned scale obtained from the Chamber of Deliberation and activated by the Secret Source Servant, Awanyu. It grants access to the Heart of the Sacred Mountain. Most dragon scales discolor and fade to white once removed from their masters as they lose the power that once ran through them. Yet this one, despite its long history, still glows gold in the darkness, displaying its might for all to see.
