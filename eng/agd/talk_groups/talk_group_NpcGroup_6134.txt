Traveler: So? How's your hidden power?
Orqo: Mmm... It's still hidden. Sometimes I can't help but think it's just keeping really, really calm. Still, it doesn't matter. I've got a long list of places I haven't been to yet!
Orqo: So there should be plenty more opportunities to awaken it, right? I've also heard some other incantations and versions recently, so I can give 'em all a try.

Orqo: Though, if Mom didn't go back to the stars, where did she go?
