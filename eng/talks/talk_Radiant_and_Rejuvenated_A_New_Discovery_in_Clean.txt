Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Radiant and Rejuvenated: A New Discovery in Cleansing"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): A clean face isn't just a requirement for beauty, but the foundation of your health!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): But clean water doesn't cut it for cleaning away all the dirt and grime, so why not use some facial cleansing ointment and give your face a true deep cleaning!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Fret not, the formula for the cleansing ointment is simple! All you need is some fresh Tidalga, Romaritime Flower petals, and Hydro Slime gel.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): After cleaning the Tidalga and petals with water, mix them in the proper proportions, and use clean gauze to wrap them to use as ingredients.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Then, using a small bowl of Hydro Slime gel as a base, heat it at a low temperature until it forms a mushy paste. Be very careful when using an open flame!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): The next step is the most critical! Take the previously prepared ingredients and grind them up to extract the juice, then slowly add the fluid into the gel paste and mix it until uniform.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): And finally, using the magic of "time," wait for the gel mixture to cool â€” and you will have a chilled cleansing ointment for your beautiful face!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): After using this ointment to clean your face, all your messy little faces will become tender and shining, and everyone will like you even more! Be sure to give it a try!
