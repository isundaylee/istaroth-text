Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?

Klee: Okay, I'll come! I like chatting.
Klee: Ah, I can show you the latest cool thing I found.
Traveler: Another cool thing?
Klee: Look at this! An awesome fishing net!
Klee: Lemme teach you! You spread the net into the lake like this... Wait for the right moment and...
Klee: Woosh! You scoop it up.
Klee: You have to make sure you're quietly hiding, then take them by surprise!
Traveler: That was pretty impressive.
Klee: Hehe, Klee told you all her secrets. Now you can be as amazing as Klee!
Klee: This way is a bit more annoying than using bombs though.
Klee: Fish are slippery and flop around a lot, so they'll jump back into the water if you don't hold them tight.
Klee: But... it's also fun to play with fish like this!
Traveler: If you're with me, then don't worry, you can use your bombs.
Klee: Oh! Really?
Klee: Then wait for me! I can make a lot of bombs really fast because I already prepared the materials!
Klee: Hee hee, I'm super happy!
Traveler: Let's have a fishing competition next time.
Klee: Okay!
Klee: #If {F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight loses, then you have to cook dinner for Klee!
Traveler: Why aren't you bombing the fish?
Klee: #Cause this is {F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight's house, so Klee should be careful not to blow stuff up...
Traveler: What is it?
