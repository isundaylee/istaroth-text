# Competition on the Sands


## Talk 1

Kaveh: Um, is it me, or are the bags under your eyes even darker than during the last round? Are you alright?
Layla: Thanks for the concern, Kaveh. I just... haven't been sleeping well lately...
Layla: Even though I try to fall asleep, I can't get the Championship out of my head... and before I know it, it's morning again.
Kaveh: *sigh* I know the feeling. That happens to me too when I'm agonizing over my blueprints.
Layla: Do you have any tips for dealing with that?
Kaveh: To be honest with you, no. You could say there are many things that don't have a quick fix, and can only be endured.
Kaveh: Hmm, I suppose you can think of it as something akin to an illness. Sometimes there's no effective cure, so you just have to let things run their course.
Kaveh: I don't know what's stressing you out, but I can feel all the anxiety and pressure coming from you. The next round's about to start, so chin up and do your best.
Layla: Oh, okay... You do your best, too.
Alhaitham: Looks like everyone's here. I will now explain the second round to you all.
Alhaitham: There are three Ley Line Disruptors buried in the area around Aaru Village.
Alhaitham: These devices can imitate the effects of Ley Line disruption and will constantly interfere with the environment. Your goal is to shut them down.
Alhaitham: The first three who manage to finish this task will be awarded four, three, and two points, accordingly.
Alhaitham: Note that each person may only bring a set amount of food and water with them, and that leaving the designated competition zone will result in disqualification.
Faruzan: Well, what do you think? Want to team up again?
Faruzan: I shall consider letting you have the points on account of what happened in the previous round.
Kaveh: That's alright. I've been here many times, and in any case, machines are one of my specialties. I doubt this will be particularly difficult.
Faruzan: It's good to see such confidence in a youngster like yourself. I also happen to be well acquainted with this place. Let's see who will find these devices first.
Faruzan: But aside from us, you should remember that there's a favorite for champion. We must be careful of him...
Paimon: A favorite to win? Who is it?
Faruzan: Shh, not so loud. I mean that boy, Tighnari.
Faruzan: He took first place in the previous round, and if he does so again this time, we may as well declare this competition over.
Faruzan: I heard that you solved the Avidya Forest's Ley Line effluence problem with him not long ago. Since this round involves resolving a machine-simulated Ley Line disruption, it should be a simple matter for him...
Paimon: Hmm, that's true. It does look like his odds of winning are pretty high!
Faruzan: He already has Collei, who is an excellent pupil. If he were to win this round as well, then wouldn't we just be letting him have all the fun?
Faruzan: As his senior, it's my solemn duty to prevent such an inequitable arrangement from happening. I'm off!
Kaveh: I'll get going as well. See you later.
Cyno: ...How are you feeling?
Tighnari: I think I'm okay. But I'll take things slowly for now.
Layla: Is this all the water we're getting?
Nilou: Sorry, that's what the rules say...
Nilou: While this round seems to be about how quickly you can shut down the devices, it's also testing your ability to survive in tough conditions.
Layla: I knew it'd be harder than I had expected.
Layla: So we'll either need to find the devices as quickly as possible, or we'll have to save our energy and wait for an opportunity... Okay, I'll head out shortly. Thanks a lot, Nilou.
Nilou: You're welcome. Please take care of yourself!
Paimon: Well, there goes everybody.
Paimon: So, who should we visit this time? Let Paimon think...
Paimon: Oh, right! Didn't Faruzan say that Tighnari's the favorite to win? Let's go look for him first!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Uh, hey, Tighnari! Tighnariii!
Paimon: Weird, the locator says that he should be around here somewhere.
Paimon: Tighnari! Can you hear us?
Traveler: He's over there.
Paimon: You're right! Oh no, it looks like he's fainted. We have to help him!
Paimon: Tighnari, are you okay?
Tighnari: It's... so hot...
Paimon: Oh, so you passed out because of the heat! Are you not used to getting around in the desert?
Tighnari: That's right... I usually bring lots of water when I go to the desert, precisely to avoid this situation.
Tighnari: I went through all my water very quickly, and with the effects of the disturbed Ley Lines, I started feeling dizzy.
Tighnari: My ancestors, the Valuka Shuna, were originally from the desert. But I guess this is what happens when a species migrates — they become intolerant of their original environment...
Paimon: This isn't the time for a history lesson. Let's get you some water—
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Humans, such fragile beings. Your bodies can't even survive extreme changes in the environment.
Traveler: Why are you here?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Here, take this. Let him drink it.
Paimon: Are you serious? This had better be just normal water... Hey! You're leaving already?
Traveler: It seems it really is just water.
Paimon: Paimon really doesn't get that guy... What's he up to? Anyway, let's focus on helping Tighnari drink some water first...
Black Screen Text: Tighnari starts to recover after getting some water...
Tighnari: I'm feeling a little better now. Thanks, you two.
Paimon: Oh, it wasn't just the two of us. Just now—
Cyno: Found you at last.
Paimon: Cyno! You're here too!
Cyno: I was concerned, so I came back to check on you. Will you be able to go on?
Tighnari: The fur on my tail is so dry it's practically been singed right off. I don't see any purpose in pushing myself beyond what is reasonable.
Tighnari: It appears I'm not suited to this particular round — I should probably just return to Aaru Village and rest.
Paimon: Really? So you're backing out?
Tighnari: Yes. I do have my results in the first round to serve as a buffer, so even if I forfeit this round, I still have a chance to turn things around later.
Tighnari: Withdrawing now will allow me to conserve my energy. Continuing to push onward would be counterproductive.
Traveler: Very decisive...
Cyno: A wise decision. Let's get you back to Aaru Village.
Tighnari: Ugh... It's fine, I can make it back on my own...
Paimon: Oh, stop trying to be so polite. Come on, we'll help you back to Aaru Village!
Traveler: I agree.
Traveler: And you consider yourself strong?

## Talk 3

Paimon: How are you feeling now, Tighnari? Do you want to rest some more?
Cyno: There's some shade here, so we can stop for a while.
Tighnari: Alright, let's do that.
Layla: #Oh, Cyno and Tighnari... and you've got {NICKNAME} and Paimon with you!
Paimon: Oh, hey Layla!
Layla: Yeah, the sun was too strong, so I decided to take cover here for a while.
Layla: What about you? Are you all done already?
Tighnari: #Unfortunately not. I'm not quite as capable as I thought... I intend to withdraw from this round. Cyno and {NICKNAME} are escorting me back to Aaru Village.
Layla: W—Withdraw? Can you even do that?
Tighnari: I believe the rules do provide for such a situation. Alhaitham did say that the act of leaving the competition grounds would result in disqualification from the round.
Cyno: Didn't I ask you if you were alright before this? If you had just decided to withdraw then, you wouldn't have had to suffer.
Tighnari: Well, I had to try, didn't I? So I tried, and it didn't work out — and now I'm backing out while I can.
Tighnari: When I get back, I'm definitely going to make a batch of sun-resistant oil. Next time I venture into the desert, I'll be prepared.
Tighnari: By the way, you're Layla, aren't you? You don't look very well yourself. Will you be alright?
Layla: I did feel a little faint when I first entered the desert, but I feel a lot better after resting here for a while.
Paimon: Be careful not to push yourself too hard!
Layla: Don't worry, I'm just...
Cyno: Feeling the pressure?
Layla: Huh? You can tell?
Cyno: Your expression is similar to the ones I see on criminals' faces when I interrogate them.
Layla: To tell you the truth, I'm still not sure whether I have what it takes to represent the Rtawahist Darshan in the Championship.
Layla: Most people voted for me because of all the rumors surrounding me, and to be honest, those rumors don't really mean anything. Now I don't know how to deal with all the expectations they've put on me.
Layla: Even the people who usually criticize me voted for me this time... So I feel like I have to live up to their expectations somehow...
Tighnari: So their expectations are putting pressure on you?
Layla: Yes. Actually, I heard that you were voted in as well, Tighnari. How do you deal with it?
Tighnari: To be completely honest, I don't really feel any pressure.
Tighnari: Firstly, those who expect things from you do not necessarily do so for benign reasons. On the other hand, those who do consider your feelings certainly wouldn't want you to push yourself.
Tighnari: Next, we are researchers. Our primary duty is to interact with knowledge, not to meet others' expectations.
Tighnari: As for me, I took part in this competition to advertise for an academic lecture at Gandharva Ville next month. I'll obviously try my best during the competition, but I won't let any additional pressure get to me.
Tighnari: I think you can also try to find a clearly defined goal. That may help you.
Layla: I understand. Thanks for your advice.
Tighnari: Phew... I'm absolutely parched after talking so much.
Cyno: I've still got some water with me.
Tighnari: No, I'll be alright. We aren't far from Aaru Village, so I can go the rest of the way myself. You should get back to the competition. Don't you want to win that limited-edition card?
Cyno: Yes. Alright then, your spirit will live on through me.
Tighnari: ...Hey, don't talk like that. I'm not dead, Cyno.
Tighnari: Everyone, I'll be heading back now. See you after the round ends.
Cyno: I'll continue searching for the Ley Line Disruptors.
Paimon: Are you feeling better now, Layla?
Layla: Yeah. I feel like some of the weight has been taken off my shoulders after chatting with Tighnari.
Layla: It's been a long time since I first left my hometown to come to the Akademiya, and every day here has been so precious... But of course, there have been some tough times.
Layla: All sorts of complex astrological models, countless quizzes, and essays that took all my brainpower to barely finish... Each of those things are like huge boulders barreling at me, forcing me to continue running forward.
Layla: When I was chosen as my Darshan's representative, it felt like another boulder was added to the ones already rolling behind me. Every time I close my eyes, I think of all the people I'd disappoint if I mess up.
Traveler: We would never be disappointed in you.
Layla: Yeah, I think that's what Tighnari was trying to tell me.
Layla: You're our good friends, which is why you didn't stop him from dropping out of this round, and why you don't feel disappointed in me.
Paimon: That's right! No need to feel so down!
Layla: That said, he did also say that he hopes I could have more concrete goals for taking part in this competition. I don't have any now, but I'll give that some thought.
Layla: Anyway, I won't take up any more of your time. You still have to record the other contestants' progress, don't you? Perhaps they've had some breakthroughs while we've been chatting.
Paimon: True, we should go look for the others. Hmm, now who's left? Tighnari's dropped out for the round, and we just saw Cyno...
Layla: You could go see how Madam Faruzan's doing. I've heard that she's quite knowledgeable about the desert, so she's probably made some progress by now...
Paimon: Okay! Let's go look for Faruzan!
Traveler: We'd prefer you to be happy, Layla.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Hey there, Faruzan. Have you made any progress?
Faruzan: Ah, you're just in time. I'm about to start digging right here.
Paimon: Oh, you found the Ley Line Disruptor already?
Faruzan: Hmph, such a simple problem could never confound me.
Faruzan: Not long after entering the desert, I discovered a Primal Construct that was acting abnormally, so I followed it all the way here.
Faruzan: Once I got near here, it suddenly disappeared. Something unusual must be happening around this area.
Paimon: You're a true expert, Madam Faruzan! You knew what to do right away!
Faruzan: Well, I do happen to have more experience than most. But that aside, has anyone completed this challenge yet?
Paimon: Nope, not yet!
Faruzan: Well then, I suppose I'll be the first. What about that boy Tighnari?
Traveler: He withdrew from this round.
Faruzan: Oh, and why's that?
Paimon: He's not used to being out and about in the desert...
Faruzan: Huh, I didn't think he would have such a weakness. I suppose he could use a bit more training.
Faruzan: What about the others? Is that Rtawahist girl still a bundle of nerves?
Paimon: Tighnari gave Layla some advice, and she seems to be doing a lot better now. Cyno just started his search for the Disruptors, and as for Hat Guy... Well, who knows what he's thinking.
Faruzan: And what about Kaveh? Has he found a Ley Line Disruptor yet?
Paimon: Paimon doesn't think so, or our locators would've already let us know.
Faruzan: Strange, what's he lollygagging for? With his skills, you should've heard something from him by now.
Faruzan: Well, I'm afraid the most thrilling moments are already done here. You should probably go find Kaveh and see how he's faring now.

## Talk 5

Kaveh: Come on, stop following me! I already gave you all the food I had on me.
Desert Fox: *whine*
Kaveh: You can cry all you want. I don't have any more food! All I have left is half a bottle of water, and I can't possibly give you that.
Kaveh: Without water, traveling in the desert will be incredibly difficult, and I still need to find what I'm looking for.
Kaveh: Mehrak, can you help me out here? Keep them away!
Mehrak: Beep-boop!
Paimon: Kaveh, there you are!
Paimon: Faruzan told us to come see how you're doing. What are you up to?
Kaveh: *sigh* Just thinking about it makes me upset. Not long after I entered the desert, I was accosted by these fellows.
Kaveh: I don't know why, but they didn't leave the competition grounds, and now the Ley Line disruptions have left them confused and circling around the area.
Kaveh: The moment they saw me, they wouldn't leave me alone. They even cheated me out of my limited food supply.
Mehrak: Beep-boop!
Desert Fox: *whine*
Kaveh: Hey, didn't I ask you to keep them away?
Paimon: Kaveh, is this flying metal thingy yours?
Kaveh: That's right. This is my toolbox, Mehrak.
Paimon: Your toolbox? It seems pretty fancy... Uh... Hey there, can you understand us?
Mehrak: Beep-boop?
Traveler: Why's it here with you?
Kaveh: Sometimes I need to carry things when I go out, so it's handy to have a portable toolbox.
Paimon: Well, this definitely doesn't look like an ordinary toolbox, that's for sure.
Kaveh: It's a long story. When I was working in the desert, I ran into a merchant group who had a machine core they excavated from some tomb.
Kaveh: It was clearly from King Deshret's civilization. His technology still isn't fully understood, and Kshahrewar has many different opinions on this topic.
Kaveh: Our current theories cannot explain such mysteries. Upon seeing such a rare, complete specimen before me, I forked over all the Mora on my person to purchase it.
Kaveh: Some time back, I wanted to make an automated case that could store my offloaded items. With that core, I created Mehrak.
Kaveh: It can't understand commands that are too complex, but it can serve as my assistant and help me with things like mapping and surveying.
Kaveh: Most importantly, it can't talk, so it can't give me any attitude.
Mehrak: Beep-boop!
Kaveh: Oh, yes — thanks for helping hide the fact that I live at Alhaitham's place earlier.
Traveler: Well, Paimon was the one who gave it away in the first place.
Paimon: Hehe, sorry...
Kaveh: *sigh* I hope this season of my life ends soon, so I can get things back on track.
Kaveh: Things just... started going downhill at some point. Maybe it all started when my mom remarried and left for Fontaine. Or maybe it all started when I spoke to Alhaitham in the library...
Kaveh: Or maybe it's because constructing the Palace of Alcazarzaray burned through my funds. I'm still paying off the debt from that one... Argh, when's this going to end!?
Desert Fox: *whine*
Kaveh: Now that I think about it, I guess we're all unlucky here.
Kaveh: It's not like any of you asked to be trapped in a Ley Line disruption... Okay, let me get you all out.
Paimon: Kaveh, aren't you going to look for the Ley Line Disruptors?
Kaveh: Yes, but I can't just leave them here, can I?
Kaveh: Oh, forget it. The more I think about this, the more I feel a headache coming on. I'll get back to searching once I get them out of here.
Kaveh: Time's a-wasting — I'm off!
Paimon: Kaveh looks like he's conflicted... He really wants to win, but he can't ignore those he wants to help...
Traveler: He's a unique character.
Paimon: Paimon's always felt like he's the type who easily gets himself into tough spots.
Paimon: Um, Paimon doesn't mean this in an insulting way, but... he seems like the kind of guy who'd be really easy to take advantage of.
Traveler: You're certainly cruel with the truth...
Paimon: Woah, someone's done already!
Traveler: That was quick.
Paimon: Right? Wonder who it is. Let's go back and ask Alhaitham!
Traveler: I wonder who it is.
Paimon: Paimon also wants to know! Let's go back and ask Alhaitham!
Traveler: He can only do one or the other...

## Talk 6

Nilou: Verification complete! Congratulations on being this round's first winner, Cyno!
Paimon: Ooh, so Cyno was the quickest!
Cyno: I am from Spantamad, after all. We know a lot about Ley Lines, so finding a disruptor was never going to be particularly difficult for me.
Nilou: #Since {NICKNAME} and Paimon also happen to be here... Do you have anything you want to say?
Cyno: Anything I want to say...? My friend couldn't continue on, so failure was never an option.
Cyno: "The bonds of yesterday will forge the road to tomorrow. With the ties of friendship that bind us, I won't lose to anyone."
Cyno: ...That's a line from "King of Invokations," one of my favorite works, and it sums up my thoughts right now.
Paimon: It might be a good thing that Tighnari isn't here, or else he'd give Cyno a good smack right about now...
Traveler: That's so Cyno.
Nilou: Oh wow, it's already so late. Everyone's probably running low on food and water — it'll only get harder from here on out.
Cyno: Something similar happened in "King of Invokations." What a classic.
Nilou: Any thoughts on that, Alhaitham?
Alhaitham: I have no thoughts regarding "King of Invokations."
Paimon: Nilou obviously wasn't asking about that!
Alhaitham: Deserts are much more dangerous at night, so this competition should be nearing its end. At the moment, only Faruzan, Layla, and Kaveh remain.
Nilou: I wonder who the next person to find a disruptor will be...
Paimon: Wait, only three people are left? Tighnari forfeited, and Cyno's already done... What about Hat Guy?
Alhaitham: He also forfeited not long ago.
Paimon: Paimon can't understand what he's thinking at all...
Paimon: But like Alhaitham said — the round's almost over. Let's go see what the other contestants are doing!

## Talk 7

Layla: Hello again... You know, it suddenly occurred to me that you guys have had to do a lot of running around this time. Don't you find it tiring?
Traveler: It's not bad.
Layla: Really? Wow. I dunno where you get your strength from...
Layla: The desert's getting colder now that night's falling. And the wind can really sting your face because of all the sand in it.
Layla: Has anyone finished this round yet?
Paimon: Cyno's already shut one down. Have you made any progress yet?
Layla: I circled the whole area, but I didn't find anything.
Layla: But I did have the chance to think some more about that thing that was weighing on my mind, and I realized something.
Traveler: And what was that?
Layla: Well, my fellow Rtawahist members must have all put my name forward for different reasons. And maybe a lot of them only picked me because they wanted to watch me make a fool of myself.
Layla: But be that as it may, I believe that a lot of them genuinely do expect great things from me.
Layla: And I want to live up to their expectations. I don't want them to regret putting my name down.
Paimon: Huh? But doesn't thinking like that put a lot of pressure on you?
Layla: Of course, that comes with some amount of pressure, for sure. But now I've thought about it, I don't feel like this is something I have to do. Instead, it's something I want to do.
Layla: That may not sound like a huge difference to you. But it's helped me relax a lot... so don't worry about me.
Paimon: Well, that's great!
Layla: Also, now that I've relaxed... I'm suddenly really sleepy...
Layla: I think I'll just... take a quick nap... just a quick one...
Layla: ...
Layla: Hmm? But the competition isn't over yet... Oh, Layla, Layla... she's really a bundle of nerves, isn't she?
Paimon: Wait, you're...!
Traveler: "Sleepwalking Layla"?
Layla: Good to see you too. Whew, it's nice to be out — feels like I've been cooped up inside for quite a while.
Layla: Well, since I'm here, I guess I should help her finish this. What are we supposed to be doing here again? Finding a Ley Line Disruptor, was it?
Layla: Let me see... Hmm, looks like she's basically gathered all the information she needs. It won't take long to wrap this up.
Layla: Come with me, you two.
Traveler: "Other Layla"?
Traveler: Yeah, a little...
Layla: Well, in that case, let's take a short breather here.

## Talk 8

Layla: Ah, this should be it, right? I'll turn it off — that should restore the Ley Lines in the area to normal.
Paimon: Nice work!
Layla: Again, I didn't do any of the real work. I'm just wrapping up.
Layla: She'll probably wake up soon... No doubt she'll be a little disoriented at first, but once she's got her bearings, she'll go and report that she shut down this disruptor.
Layla: Will you be staying here for a while? Or are you going to check on the other contestants?
Paimon: Time to check our locator... Whoa! It looks like Kaveh and Faruzan are heading toward the same place!
Layla: Perhaps they're about to find the last disruptor. ...Also, speaking of Kaveh, he's an interesting one.
Paimon: Huh? Why do you say that?
Layla: Before the second round, he had a chat with the other me. He said that worries can be like illnesses — they don't always have a magic cure. Sometimes, you just have to endure them as best you can until they run their course.
Layla: But the way I see it, his situation is much worse than my other self's... She just hadn't found what she wanted to do at that moment, which is why she felt lost.
Layla: Kaveh, meanwhile, knows what he wants to do — he's convinced that he has to win — and yet, he still seems conflicted...
Layla: He doesn't have a second personality, but... somehow, he still seems like he's at odds with himself in some way.
Layla: ...I don't know exactly how to describe it. It's like he's smiling on the outside, but there's no joy inside. Only sorrow.
Layla: Still, who knows. He must be more experienced than me — maybe he's just better at dealing with it all than I am.
Layla: Oh, but back to the topic of wrapping up... Shouldn't you be getting back to the action to record how everything plays out? Last one, then the round's over.
Paimon: Oh, true. Okay then, guess we'll be going now! We'll keep everything you said in mind!

## Talk 9

Faruzan: It should be around here...
Kaveh: Finally found it...
Faruzan: Kaveh? Are you...
Kaveh: Madam Faruzan! And here I thought you would've finished this round by now...
Paimon: Faruzan, Kaveh!
Paimon: Oh, looks like Layla's already done.
Kaveh: I didn't expect that you and I would find a disruptor at the same time... How are the other contestants doing?
Paimon: Tighnari and Hat Guy forfeited, while Cyno and Layla are already done. You two are the only ones left.
Paimon: Huh, that's weird. Didn't you start digging really early on?
Faruzan: Yes. I kept digging, but instead of finding a disruptor, I found a ruin.
Faruzan: I fell down pretty deep, and it was completely dark in there. It took me quite some time to unlock the various mechanisms and return to the surface.
Paimon: That's... actually really impressive...
Kaveh: Finishing a week's worth of trials in such a short time... That's pretty amazing, Madam Faruzan...
Faruzan: What about you? Why are you so late?
Kaveh: I encountered a lot of lost Desert Foxes along the way, and I brought them to the outskirts of the competition zone. When I came back, I was absolutely parched... and then I blacked out. Probably from the heat, you know.
Kaveh: When I woke up, it was already night. I used the last of my strength to come here.
Faruzan: A most curious reason indeed... Ah, but are you sure you're alright? It sounds like you were in an incredibly dangerous situation.
Faruzan: You said you were familiar with the desert, but the way you handle problems... It does feel rather at odds with your title as a genius.
Kaveh: Ahaha, it was problematic, but that had nothing to do with me being a genius. It was my decision.
Kaveh: ...The way I did things wasn't optimal, but I wouldn't have been comfortable not doing it, either. My conscience would've weighed on me.
Faruzan: ...Hmph. Youths these days, each stranger than the next.
Faruzan: But back to the main issue at hand. Since we're both very certain that this is where the final Ley Line Disruptor is, let's dig it up then.
Black Screen Text: Working together, the two unearth the final Ley Line Disruptor.
Faruzan: Well, this is indeed it, of that there is no doubt. But how should we count the score this time?
Kaveh: Phew...
Faruzan: What is it, youngster? You seem relieved.
Kaveh: Oh, nothing. I was just thinking that this round's finally over.
Kaveh: ...There shouldn't be any more innocent creatures getting wrapped up in danger.
Kaveh: As for the points... I guess we can draw lots again later. I can't think of anything better.
Paimon: Alright. In that case, let's all head back to Aaru Village. Paimon thinks you'll both need some water and rest.

## Talk 10

Nilou: Looks like the second round is over. I wonder who was faster, Kaveh or Madam Faruzan? ...Huh? Where's Madam Faruzan?
Kaveh: She went to get water — she'll be back shortly. We basically arrived at the same time, so we'd like to draw lots again.
Alhaitham: You get caught up in some things so easily — like drawing lots.
Kaveh: I'm not "caught up" in anything! Don't make it sound like I take pleasure in having bad luck!
Alhaitham: Really? Then, should I say that you have a curious affinity for drawing lots?
Nilou: Um, I'll go get the box and slips of paper for the lots. Please wait a moment...
Kaveh: ...
Faruzan: Oho, here we go again. Let's see how I fare.
Black Screen Text: After a brief but tense lot-drawing, Kaveh emerges triumphant...
Kaveh: I got it! Did you see that? I won!
Nilou: Congratulations!
Paimon: Looks like Kaveh's luck's taken a turn for the better!
Kaveh: Finally, after all this time... *sniff*
Faruzan: It looks like you've been rewarded for your tribulations in the desert. This round's points are yours.
Alhaitham: ...
Nilou: And with that, our second round is done. Cyno, Layla, and Kaveh are our victorious contestants!
Nilou: As for the current standings, let me see...
Nilou: Cyno and Layla both have four points, putting them both in first place. The rest in descending order are Tighnari, Faruzan, Kaveh, and Hat Guy.
Nilou: The next round will be the final one. Please rest up before then, everyone.
Nilou: I heard that some stalls at the Wisdom Gala are debuting new games, so feel free to drop by if you're interested. Otherwise, see you next round!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Nilou: Now that the round's begun, who do you think will win, Alhaitham?
Alhaitham: The ones who find the disruptors will win.
Nilou: Well, um, yes... but aren't you just repeating the rules?

### Additional Talk 2

Nilou: I didn't expect Tighnari to drop out...
Alhaitham: Being able to acknowledge one's own weaknesses is a rare quality.

### Additional Talk 3

Nilou: Things are really heating up now! You can feel the contestants' passion too, can't you, Alhaitham?
Alhaitham: Compared to the abstraction of human emotions, the desert heat is easier to intuit. Tighnari made the right decision to forfeit.

### Additional Talk 4

#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: This seems more annoying than the last round. That's fine, though — I'll find someplace to sit and watch them scurry.

### Additional Talk 5

Cyno: The sun is especially intense today. I hope Tighnari will be alright.
Cyno: *sigh* Probably not. I should go check on him.

### Additional Talk 6

Layla: *pants* I feel... a little faint...

### Additional Talk 7

Faruzan: Let me see. Where would they put one of these disruptors...

### Additional Talk 8

Kaveh: A Desert Fox? Why would there be Desert Foxes here? Woah, stop biting my clothes! Hey!

### Additional Talk 9

#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: You two must have a lot of free time if you came looking for me.

### Additional Talk 10

Kaveh: There's another one...

### Additional Talk 11

Layla: Don't worry, I'll be fine.

### Additional Talk 12

Paimon: Looks like someone's taking it easy!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: You should be thrilled that I have nothing to do. Otherwise, that means someone's in for a very, very bad day.
Paimon: But if you don't get any points this round, you won't have a shot at winning!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: It's not like I care about winning or clout. Really, the real prize for me is watching all these people fight over something so useless.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Oh, you've reminded me of something. There shouldn't be any more incidents after this round. If you'll excuse me, I have somewhere to be.

### Additional Talk 13

Cyno: "I will never give up..."
Cyno: Hmm, how did the rest go... Oh, right! "I will never give up! My will is my greatest weapon..."

### Additional Talk 14

Layla: I think I'll start by doing a loop around the competition zone...

### Additional Talk 15

Faruzan: Mm-hmm! Here it comes! I think I'm about to strike gold!

### Additional Talk 16

Layla: There's a few things that seem a little off about this place. Lemme collect my thoughts for a second...

### Additional Talk 17

#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Hmph, I see. Twenty years ago...

### Additional Talk 18

Cyno: Are you alright?
Tighnari: Much better. Aaru Village's hospitality sure is something... Two whole pitchers of water, to be precise.
Cyno: If your throat's too wet as a result, I can provide some dry humor—
Tighnari: No, no thanks! Much appreciated, though.

### Additional Talk 19

Kaveh: Shh, quiet. I'm currently trying to find a way out of here.
Desert Fox: *whine*
