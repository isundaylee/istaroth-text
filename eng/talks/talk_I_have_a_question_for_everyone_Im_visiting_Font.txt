Question: "I have a question for everyone. I'm visiting Fontaine with my kid, and I don't know where he heard about the Oceanids, but he's throwing a tantrum about seeing them."
Question: "But the Oceanids disappeared from Fontaine long ago. As a father, should I tell him the truth, or keep making up excuses?"
Another Person's Message: "Just keep lying. Kids get obsessed easily but get over it quickly, he'll forget about it soon. Just play with him, and by the time he gets bored, it'll all be over."
A Third Person's Message: "I think you should tell him the truth sooner rather than later. Lies cannot stay with him for his whole life, and rather than being laughed at by others later, his illusions should be gently popped by his father."
Owner's Message: "Maybe it's not important what you tell him. What's important is that you're here with him, and that you love him."
