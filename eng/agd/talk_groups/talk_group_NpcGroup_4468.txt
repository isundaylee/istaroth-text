Boyan: The market outlook's not been the best lately. I'd better stock up just in case...

Traveler: And you are...?
Boyan: Ah, dear guest, how fortunate that our paths should cross! Boyan's the name, "a merchant from Liyue" is the game.
Boyan: I transport goods from Liyue to Fontaine, and goods from Fontaine to Sumeru, and I pocket the difference. After all, everyone loves seeing things they've never seen before!
Boyan: A merchant's gotta keep their eyes peeled and their ears open. And I hear that tea's been on the downswing recently, and that's worrying news.

Traveler: Goods?
Boyan: If tea's your thing, know that the "Chenyu Adeptea" of Chenyu Vale is the very best there is.
Boyan: But there's been trouble in the vale's water and soil, and the tea quality's dropped like a rock in a river!
Boyan: This has troubled me day and night, and I can think of only one solution...

Traveler: I shan't disturb you any longer.
Boyan: *sigh* I can't keep being so down. I'll scare my customers away...

Traveler: What way?
Boyan: Why, of course, I'll stock up on goods while spreading the word that "all is well in Chenyu Vale."
Boyan: And once everyone finds themselves unable to secure good tea leaves... Well...
Boyan: Oh dear, did I say too much?
Boyan: Ah, but you're the sort who can keep a secret, aren't you?

Traveler: And you are...?
Boyan: Ah, dear guest, how fortunate that our paths should cross! Boyan's the name, "a merchant from Liyue" is the game.
Boyan: Our work's pretty tough, and risk is a constant companion, too. I haven't had a good night's sleep in several days now on account of that tea. Only now have I been able to heave a sigh of relief.
Boyan: *sigh* When will I be able to sit in a teahouse and just enjoy a cup of Chenyu Adeptea?

## Talk 5

Traveler: Supply problem?
Boyan: Indeed! Businesspeople like me fear blocked roads, robbed clientele, and worst of all, cut supplies!
Boyan: I've run routes throughout Teyvat for many years, building my reputation on naught but the excellent quality of my goods.
Boyan: Then, a few days ago, a wealthy gentleman ordered ten carts of Chenyu Adeptea from me...
Boyan: Only for there to be water and soil trouble in the vale... Even with the goods that I had stocked, I couldn't come up with ten carts!
Boyan: My reputation will be destroyed if I mix the top-grade goods with average stuff, but if I don't deliver on time at all...

Traveler: You shouldn't have to worry about that now.
Boyan: Hmm? You're the well-informed sort, I see!
Boyan: Indeed, I hear tell that we have a Carp Adeptus's aid to thank...
Boyan: Well, not that I'd know much about this. All I know is that business is back on track!

## Talk 6

Traveler: I shan't disturb you any longer.
