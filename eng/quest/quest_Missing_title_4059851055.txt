## Talk 1

Aragita: It's been a long wait for Aragita and the Golden Nara is finally here. Don't let this chance slip away. Let's play?

## Talk 2

Traveler: Sure. What are we playing?
Aragita: Aragita hid all kinds of paintings under the wooden chests to see if Nara has the ability of "never forget." Remember <color=#00E1FFFF>the painting with the most strokes</color>?
Traveler: Okay, let's do this.

## Talk 3

Traveler: Not the right timing.
Aragita: Aragita won't rush. Will wait for the "right timing."

## Talk 4

Aragita: Grass and trees remember, and so does Nara. Nara is Aranara's friend, and the friend of grass and trees, too.

## Talk 5

Aragita: Nara got it wrong, but it doesn't matter. There is a lot of "next time." Any time playing with Nara is "the right time" for Aragita.
