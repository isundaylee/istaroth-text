Agafya: What is it? Is there anything else? I've already told you everything I know...

Agafya: Like I told you, I don't know much about it... They were probably just some simple tests, but running all over these islands was just... incredibly tiring.
Traveler: About Zakhar...

Traveler: About the photo...
Agafya: Well, that's my two brothers in the photo, both of whom have devoted their services to Snezhnaya. I've always been proud of them.
Traveler: See you...
