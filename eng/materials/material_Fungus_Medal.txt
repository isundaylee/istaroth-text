# Fungus Medal

A medal made from unique materials, and the reward given to outstanding participants in the Special Training stage of the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament.
Working together to defeat powerful enemies in the Special Training grounds is one of the key aspects to nurturing the bond between you and your Fungi friends and growing stronger together.
These coins can be used to exchange for precious items during the "Fabulous Fungus Frenzy" event.
