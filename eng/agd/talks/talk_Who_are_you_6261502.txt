Traveler: Who are you?
Jiawei: Ah, how do you do? My name's Jiawei.
Jiawei: As you can see, I'm a fisherman... An elite one at that.
Jiawei: I know I just look like some guy staring out into space here at the harbor, but back in the day, I was a seafaring, legendary-fish-catching professional!
Jiawei: As for now, well, you've got to stay grounded, you know? A lifetime of adventure on the waves, with your family worrying about you day in and day out... That's no way to keep living forever.
Jiawei: Wouldn't you agree?
