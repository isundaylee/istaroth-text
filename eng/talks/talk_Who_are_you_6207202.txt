Traveler: Who are you...?
Ivanovich: I am Ivanovich, pleasure to meet you! I am a businessman from Snezhnaya. I am now waiting for my next delivery.
Ivanovich: The people of Liyue are very wealthy! I import goods from Snezhnaya and everything sells out almost as soon as it arrives.
Ivanovich: If I had known sooner, I would have opened my own store here so I could sell directly to consumers. That way I would not have to oversee the deliveries myself.
