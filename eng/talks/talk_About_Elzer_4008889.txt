Traveler: About Elzer...
Hertha: Ah, so you heard... Elzer is the executive chairman of the Mondstadt Wine Guild.
Hertha: This year, the Knights of Favonius, in collaboration with the Church of Favonius and the Adventurers' Guild, is hosting a Wine Market and are in need of a special budget.
Hertha: However, Elzer invited me to collaborate and he helped us solve a lot of our financial problems.
Hertha: Although he didn't say it explicitly... But my guess is that this grant came at the behest of a once senior Knight of Favonius.
