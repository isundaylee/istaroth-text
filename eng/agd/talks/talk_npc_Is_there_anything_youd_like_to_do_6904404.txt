Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Xinyan: Hm... Wanna try out the lyre?
Xinyan: You've seen and heard so many of my shows.
Xinyan: If you're interested and wanna give it a fair go, I can teach you step by step!
Traveler: I've learned how to play instruments before.
Xinyan: Wow, really? That's great!
Xinyan: Oh, at least for me, rock 'n' roll is somethin' as important as life itself.
Xinyan: If I could perform rock 'n' roll with you, that'd be twice as— no, the best thing in this world!
Xinyan: O—Of course, I know that our music tastes won't be the same. The "rock 'n' roll" I'm thinkin' of here isn't limited to the music itself.
Xinyan: If there's a part of you that's unwillin', I definitely won't force ya!
Traveler: For you, I'll try...
Xinyan: Aw...
Xinyan: Then I gotta live up to your faith in me and be a good teacher!
Xinyan: Here, this is my lyre.
Xinyan: Now get ready to train hard, because I'm about to turn up the heat!
Traveler: Maybe we can find another way of interpreting rock 'n' roll?
Xinyan: No. Prob. Lem!
Xinyan: Honestly... Just the fact that you're willin' to give it a try means a lot to me.
Xinyan: After all, you're very special to me...
Xinyan: Hehe... I look forward to us doin' "rock 'n' roll" together!
Traveler: I'm afraid that I won't play very well...
Xinyan: Don't sweat it, you got me helpin' you!
Xinyan: I'll pay attention to every method and every step... Although this is my first time actin' as a teacher.
Traveler: Why would you ask me to play?
