# As the Courtyard in Spring Once Appeared


## Talk 1

Old Servant: Master, we're the only servants left! Are you sure about this? After we're gone, who's going to...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Don't worry, I'll be fine.
Old Servant: Your mother died early, and now that your father has left you... You're all that remains of this clan now...
Old Servant: I suppose that this is the last time we will ever see each other. Master, please take care of yourself.
Sailor: Everyone, on board!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Farewell.

## Talk 2

Kaedehara Kazuha: The Kaedehara Clan has ultimately disbanded in my hands.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But as my father said, I should not let life imprison me. Perhaps living the wanderer's life is what was meant for me after all.

## Talk 3

Kaedehara Kazuha: You know, they say that Visions represent the Archons' gaze.
Friend: But is being under an Archon's gaze really a blessing?
Kaedehara Kazuha: I don't know, maybe...?

## Talk 4

Shogunate Infantry: Vision Hunt Decree! Hand over your Visions now!
Friend: This way! Hurry!

## Talk 5

Kaedehara Kazuha: I know very well why people resist against the Vision Hunt Decree.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Ambition is our power in its rawest form. We cannot live without it.

## Talk 6

Kaedehara Kazuha: When no other option remains, I will leave.

## Talk 7

Kaedehara Kazuha: The life of a wanderer is full of hardships. I have asked myself these questions many times:
Kaedehara Kazuha: Should I go? If so, where to, and by what means?

## Talk 8

Kaedehara Kazuha: But I have no choice. The boundless world is calling out to me.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Farewell, my dear grandfather and father.

## Talk 9

Kaedehara Kazuha: A final farewell, for I do not believe I will ever return to Inazuma.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But if one day, I do return...
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...No. That day will never come.

## Talk 10

Kaedehara Kazuha: My grandfather once traveled to Liyue, while my father read about Mondstadt... but where is the right place for me?
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...The sky's getting dark. It looks like it's going to rain.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Will the rain ever stop?

## Talk 11

Paimon: Kazuha! We found you!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Good timing. I was just reflecting on my life so far, and I think I'm all up to date.
Kaedehara Kazuha: So, what do you think of the Kaedehara Clan's bonsai?
Traveler: Looks like it carries lots of history.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Old things often carry around some form of regret. The Kaedehara Clan is no exception.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But that's okay. Partings produce reunions, if not at home then in a distant land.
Mona: This mirage is quite fascinating. It presents life like a stage play, with each scene more captivating than the last.
Kaedehara Kazuha: They say that astrologists have seen it all. So if this mirage intrigued you, that says it was a worthwhile encounter.
Fischl: Ahem... How fares thy mood?
Oz: Mein Fräulein inquires as to your present wellbeing, Lord Kazuha, hoping your heart is not too filled with sorrow.
Paimon: There's no way anyone could be cheerful after reliving all that...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Haha, you have a point. Thank you all for your concern. Fortunately, all those things are past and gone now.
Kaedehara Kazuha: When I first saw this bonsai, I thought of the possibility that... I needed to wait for you. Perhaps that was why I had to be here on my own.
Traveler: Things weren't perfect, but you have nothing to feel ashamed of.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Indeed.

## Talk 12

Paimon: *yawn*... It's been a long trip today, Paimon's getting kinda sleepy...
Xinyan: Everyone must be exhausted. Let's call it a day.
Fischl: ...
Mona: Hmm? What's wrong? You don't look too good.
Fischl: Nothing. Perhaps today's arduous journey is making me feel slightly out of sorts.
Oz: ...
Oz: Mein Fräulein, are you alright?
Fischl: Oz, curb thy curiosity.
Oz: Yes, mein Fräulein.
Mona: ...?
Xinyan: I'll see if I can find something for us to eat. Go ahead and rest if you're feeling tired, but anyone who's up to it is welcome to help out.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I'll help.
Mona: Me too.
Paimon: Everyone's volunteering to help! Maybe we should too!
Traveler: Count us in.
Xinyan: Whoa, hey, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but...
Xinyan: Her Highness looks kinda gloomy. Mona, you two seem close, why don't you keep her company for a while?
Mona: You noticed it too. I was going to bring it up with you while we were preparing the food. In that case, yes, just leave it to me.
Xinyan: Alright! We'll prepare the food!
Black Screen Text: Mona gives you a wink, then runs to stay with Fischl. Everyone else collects cooking ingredients...
Xinyan: Yup, this should be enough. We can grill these. Next time we pass by one of those abandoned campsites, I'll see if they have a cooking pot. We'd have some more variety then.
Paimon: Wow, that's such a nice idea! You might not be a chef, Xinyan, but you sure do know how to keep the diners happy.
Xinyan: Aw shucks, Paimon. It's no big deal, just doing what I can!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Even the crew mates of The Alcor consider Xinyan someone they can rely on.
Paimon: We feel the same way about you, too, Kazuha!
Xinyan: Hahaha, we sure do.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm... Well then, as a trusted friend, I have something I'd like to talk about.
Kaedehara Kazuha: From what you've been saying, that miraculous mirage seems to have been based on my life story to date.
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...It felt just like a dream to me.
Traveler: Maybe that's it. Maybe it represented your dreams.
Xinyan: In other words... you've always wanted to make your own bonsai, right?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Could that be it...? All that was a means of granting me something I wished for?
Kaedehara Kazuha: And since this happened to me, does that mean it could happen to everyone else, too?
Traveler: Yes, I think so.
Xinyan: I agree. But I wonder whose mirage we'll encounter next?
Xinyan: Hah, I'm actually kinda looking forward to my own mirage, if it's a dream come true like you say.
Paimon: Wait, you actually want something like this to happen with you, too?
Xinyan: Aw heck, any mirage to do with me would probably be music-related. Hahaha, it'd be a good chance to showcase a few tunes!
Paimon: You mean you'd wanna do a performance in there!?
Xinyan: Why not? I don't think any self-respecting musician could stay silent on these islands. Just look at this place!
Paimon: So much confidence and optimism! Xinyan rocks...
Paimon: #Oh, uh, Traveler! Paimon wants to try some of the fruit growing on that cliff over there. Let's go pick some!
Traveler: (Oh? Is this about...)
Traveler: Carry on without us, I need a moment with Paimon.

## Talk 13

Paimon: So, those strange houses today, huh... And a... a mirage-bonsai? Basically, lots of weird stuff today! Do you think we should tell Venti about it?
Traveler: I thought you were gonna ask me that.
Dodocommunication Device: Dodoco! Dodoco!
Dodocommunication Device: Dodoco! Dodoco! Dodoco!
Paimon: There's no answer... That's weird, why is he ignoring us?
Traveler: This doesn't seem like him...
Paimon: Maybe he got distracted? Or he forgot to bring the bomb to his performance? Or maybe he got drunk and fell asleep under that huge tree...
Paimon: Hmm... maybe we should try contacting him tomorrow.
Mona: Traveler, Paimon. So here you are.
Paimon: Mona! Are you all done chatting with Fischl?
Mona: Hahaha, close enough... She was a little downcast. I think it has something to do with the mirage we saw today.
Mona: Fischl has been very excited about this trip from the start... but I have a feeling she doesn't want to see her own mirage...
Paimon: Why? It seems like this'd be the kind of thing she really enjoys.
Mona: ...I'm not sure at this stage, but I'll keep an eye on her.
Mona: There's something else I wanted to tell you. I tried performing a divination again on the beach.
Mona: My scryglass was still blurry, but I felt a force coming from within. I couldn't see its exact position, but I knew that it was changing.
Paimon: How could you tell that if you couldn't see it clearly?
Mona: Hmm, how can I explain this concept to non-experts... Oh, I know! It's like we're sitting in a room and there's a crack in the walls. We don't know where it is, but everyone can feel the wind rushing in.
Mona: Not only that, but the room is getting colder.
Paimon: Ohh! Paimon gets it now! So you wanna find where that crack is, right?
Mona: You could say that. I need to see the crack first before deciding what to do next.
Traveler: Let's give him a call.
