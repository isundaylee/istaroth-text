Tepano: I heard someone mention that some Condessence Crystals had emerged out of nowhere. Our first thought was that it might be Ley Line troubles, so a whole bunch of people rushed over to check things out.
Tepano: As it turned out, it was just some ordinary ore. Not that having a place to replenish resources is a bad thing, of course. If you wanna have a look, it should be in... this direction.

Traveler: In a good mood, I see?
Tepano: You bet.
Tepano: Patrolling around the Masters of the Night-Wind is just the easiest thing. These people are either impossible to find or holed up indoors.
Tepano: And the few not-very-intimidating monsters that there are in the area can be easily beaten using pre-prepared Phlogiston Engravings.
Tepano: The main thing I've gotta do is keep reckless outsiders from disturbing the Iktomisaurs. Get on their bad side and their tempers are no joke, I'll tell you that.

Tepano: You bet.
Tepano: As long as there aren't any large-scale Abyssal assaults like that one before, patrolling around the Masters of the Night-Wind might just be the easiest thing there is.
Tepano: Now that assault was tough... Thank goodness a whole bunch of friends from outside came to help out.
Tepano: But usually, the people in our tribe are either impossible to find or holed up indoors.

Traveler: Calming people down requires skill.
Tepano: Very true!
Tepano: Some Saurians are just too stubborn. The last time someone touched an Iktomisaurus's feathers without permission, they ended up writing a three-page apology!
Tepano: Who knows if the apology even made sense to the Saurian? But I guess that just goes to show the price of acting on impulse, haha.
