# Talk Dialog

Kamisato Ayato: Oh, I didn't expect to meet you here.
Traveler: About your drink...
Kamisato Ayato: I've been told that this is a beverage called "Fonta." I quite like its unique taste.
Kamisato Ayato: The slogan, "A Font of Refreshment," is rather catchy as well. I'm starting to wonder if I could incorporate it into our cultural exchange initiative.
Kamisato Ayato: What would happen if we were to add some sprigs of mint into Fonta? I believe this is an idea worth testing.
Kamisato Ayato: Or perhaps we could even take it one step further, and mix in an equal amount of Milk Tea Medley...
Kamisato Ayato: Hehe, but for some reason, I suspect that experiment wouldn't turn out well.
Traveler: About the film...
Kamisato Ayato: Thanks to you, the film was successfully completed and the Yashiro Commission secured a collaboration project with the Palais Mermonia.
Kamisato Ayato: If another opportunity was to arise in the future, perhaps I should take on the chance to act as the protagonist.
Kamisato Ayato: Or perhaps... you think the role of villain would fit me better?
Traveler: Have a safe trip home.
Kamisato Ayato: Thank you for the well wishes. I will take good care of Ayaka and Yoimiya.
Kamisato Ayato: I would like to wish you safe travels on your next journey as well.
