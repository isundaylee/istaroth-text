Traveler: About fighting the Abyss...
Pacal: The credit for our previous victory against the Abyss belongs to every single person of Natlan. It was a great victory, yet undeniably a temporary one.
Pacal: The Pyro Archon has visited several times after the war, inquiring about our casualties and providing strong support for our reconstruction efforts.
Pacal: However, she also emphasized that the Abyss has not yet been defeated once and for all, so we must stay vigilant.
Pacal: Thank you too, for your care and contributions. I believe that as long as we all stay united, we will surely be able to persevere until victory is ours.
