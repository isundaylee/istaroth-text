Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Gongming: Well, this isn't a secret anymore. It must be the talk of the town by now.
Gongming: It never rains, but it only pours. Rex Lapis had just left us, and then some unidentified scoundrel broke into the Golden House...
Gongming: But what concerns me most is that when we did an inventory check afterward, not a single Mora was found to be missing.
Gongming: Assaulting the Golden House, but not for Mora — what manner of deed is that? I can't wrap my head around it...

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Gongming: It seems like every man and his dog has heard the news now... Perhaps the Qixing are not as omnipotent as I thought.
Gongming: To tell the truth, the news has shaken me to the core. For Rex Lapis to leave us like this, so suddenly... I dare not contemplate the implications.
Gongming: Added to this... I am at a loss to explain some of the Qixing's recent activity. Particularly some of my orders — what is asked of me far exceeds the scope of my authority...

Traveler: What is this place?
Gongming: I am under no obligation to respond to your questions... However, since you display such a woeful ignorance of well-known facts...
Gongming: I shall indulge you this time... This is the "Golden House." Though, you may simply think of it as the Liyue Mint... or, in fact, the Teyvat Mint.
Gongming: The source of all wealth, the foundation of ambition, the lifeblood of the economy... I am a steward here, and I take every precaution to ensure the security of this place.
