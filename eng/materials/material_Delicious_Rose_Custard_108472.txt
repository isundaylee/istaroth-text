# Delicious Rose Custard

A dessert made from fermented milk. When mixed together, the dense curd, fragrant petals, and crisp nuts together create a mellow and sweet taste. As that fragrant milky concoction slips down your throat, it is almost as if you can smell the floral scent from a long time ago.
