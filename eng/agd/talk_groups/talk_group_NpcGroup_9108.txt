## Talk

Lan Yan: #Hey, Traveler! I made it!
Lan Yan: This place is fascinating! It's perfect for Windtrace.

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Lan Yan: It's a lot different from what I'm used to.
Traveler: Is there something you don't like?
Lan Yan: Oh, no, no! That's not what I meant at all!
Lan Yan: Being here... It's just a new sensation, that's all!
Lan Yan: I've never been somewhere so amazing! I'm so excited, my heart feels like it's beating a mile a minute!
Traveler: I guess this place is pretty big...
Lan Yan: Definitely... The size is only part of it, though. What's really impressive is what you've done with the place!
Lan Yan: I never get lost in the mountains back home, and that's a big area, too.
Lan Yan: But, as I was exploring this place just now, I really had to pay attention, or I never would have found my way back!
Traveler: It's okay. I would come and save you!
Lan Yan: Hehe, really?
Lan Yan: Then, if you hear the frantic ringing of a silver bell, come find me, okay?

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Lan Yan: Sure! Then, let's talk about... Ooh! How you're feeling right now!
Lan Yan: Yeah, that's it! Tell me what you're thinking in this exact moment!
Traveler: That's kind of sudden... I'm not sure what to say...
Lan Yan: That's exactly my point!
Lan Yan: I'm not sure if you've noticed, but it feels like you know me a lot better than I know you.
Lan Yan: Think about it — we've talked about my hobbies, my problems, all the embarrassing things I've done...
Lan Yan: But, when it comes to you, I know about your past achievements and your future goals, but that's it.
Lan Yan: Not that that's a bad thing, it's just... the past and future are only part of the story...
Lan Yan: And all too often in life, people end up neglecting the here and now.
Lan Yan: For instance, people talk about how you never stop. No matter how tough your journey gets, you just grit your teeth and keep going.
Lan Yan: Sure, it means you accomplish a huge amount each day. But it also means that you don't get to stop and rest, even when you feel tired...
Lan Yan: I guess what I'm getting at is... Is this what you really want in life? It feels like you're busier than a swallow trying to build a nest.
Traveler: Of course! It's really fulfilling.
Lan Yan: Huh. Wow, I didn't expect that answer!
Lan Yan: I thought you were going to break down and tell me how tired you are.
Lan Yan: Haha, I'm glad! That's all I could hope for! It means you're not short on energy, at least!
Lan Yan: I suppose there's no need for me to worry. Let me ask you this, then...
Lan Yan: Do you ever get to nap or sleep in? Oh, and can your hands do entirely different tasks at the same time?
Traveler: To be honest, I'm beat...
Lan Yan: Silver needs to be hammered time and again for it to shine, but humans don't work that way! If you're tired, just rest!
Lan Yan: Now, I want you to close your eyes. Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind, and we'll go do it!
Lan Yan: Well? Was it eating a delicious meal? Or doing some sight-seeing?
Lan Yan: What!? You thought about all the unfinished commissions in your Adventurer Handbook!?
Lan Yan: *sigh*... Well, if that's what it takes to get you to rest...
Lan Yan: Alright, I'll go with you. But, in two days, okay?
Lan Yan: I don't want to go right now, and I should respect how I feel in the moment, right? Now, all you need to do is follow my example.
Lan Yan: Actually, can I add an urgent commission to your handbook? "Spend the next two days relaxing with Lan Yan"... There. Even if you're not tired, I certainly am...

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Lan Yan: I was just thinking about what you could add to this place...
Traveler: Oh? Is there something I'm missing?
Lan Yan: Well... I wanted to make some rattan furniture for you, but it looks like you have everything covered around here...
Traveler: Oh, yeah! They're all things from my collection, or things I made myself.
Lan Yan: Hehe, I can tell they mean a lot to you. All of these pieces are in great shape! You must really cherish them.
Lan Yan: Wait, I've got it!
Lan Yan: I'll make rattan covers for your furniture. Oh, and some of the more fragile trinkets around here, too! You'll never have to worry about scratches again!
Traveler: That sounds like a lot of work!
Lan Yan: It's no trouble at all! Don't forget, I'm a member of the Artisans Association. It's what I do! And, I enjoy it!
Lan Yan: Besides, I'm the one imposing upon your hospitality. It's the least I can do!
Lan Yan: If you like the idea, then I'll get started right away. If you have reservations... just let me know!
Traveler: I'd love nothing more than to add Madame Lan's works to my collection!
Lan Yan: Haha, you flatter me! To have such an eminent figure praise my work... The honor is all mine!
Lan Yan: Alright, I humored you, so we can drop the formalities, right?
Lan Yan: Then, let me say this...
Lan Yan: Once the covers are ready, don't feel like you need to store them away for safe-keeping. Use them to your heart's content!
Lan Yan: Oh, and promise me you won't cover them with any cloth to try and protect them...
Lan Yan: *sigh*... I barely remember what our own furniture looks like... Every day, it's like my mom adds another layer of cloth...
Traveler: Alright, you have my word!
Lan Yan: Great! Then I'll get started right away. Measurements first!
Traveler: How can I help?
Lan Yan: Actually, there is something I need from you...
Lan Yan: Tell me the stories behind all these items! I'm dying to know!
Traveler: What if I damage them?
Lan Yan: Oh, that's what you're worried about?
Lan Yan: All rattan strands are washed, sun-dried, shaped, and planed before using, and that doesn't even touch on the steaming, oiling, or coloring processes...
Lan Yan: Point being, it's not an issue! Not to brag or anything, but my rattan crafts are extremely durable! You don't have to worry about moisture or insects!
Lan Yan: Even if they get damaged — and that's a big if — I can always fix them. Unless, you're saying you don't trust my skills...

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Lan Yan.
Lan Yan: Morning! Did you sleep well?
Lan Yan: Huh, it looks like you could use a nap.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Lan Yan.
Lan Yan: Night! Don't let me keep you!
Lan Yan: I'm gonna stay up and finish this novel — only two pages to go. A mysterious entity under the bed just grabbed the main character by the foot...

Lan Yan: Wow, I never thought I'd get to take a walk down the country lanes while I'm here! Did you set all this up just for me?
Lan Yan: Fresh fruit and vegetables, groceries, and... what's that over there? I feel spoiled for choice! Haha.
Lan Yan: I gotta walk down this street and take this all in. Come on! Keep up!

## Talk

Lan Yan: Silverware needs to be kept in clean, dry conditions, just like books. At home, we actually keep all our silver in a study room just like this.
Lan Yan: You shouldn't stack silver, because sometimes it can be a little soft and malleable. The best way to store it is to wrap it up in cloth and put it on a bookshelf.
Lan Yan: That reminds me — I brought some pieces from my collection with me, and they need a lot of care. It's probably time I gave them a clean... do you wanna see them?
