# The Final Experiment: Withering Glory


## Talk 1

Albedo: I imagine you must have encountered more than a few conundrums during your travels.
Albedo: I'd like to observe your intelligence by means of a practical test of your capabilities — much as we did for the physical test.
Traveler: No problem.
Albedo: I'd like you to explore these ruins and return with your findings.
Albedo: There are two puzzles located at the far ends of the ruins. After completion, you should be able to activate the mechanism in the center.
Albedo: As with the physical test, there are no restrictions. Everything you do is an action I wish to observe.
Traveler: I'm getting good at these.
Albedo: A tried and tested adventurer I see.
Albedo: So, let's see you in action. Start wherever you like.
Traveler: Where there's a will, there's a way.
Albedo: Remember that this is a test of intellect. So should you get lucky in any way, that won't be factored in as part of the test.
Traveler: Wouldn't a written test suffice...?

## Talk 2

Timaeus: Sorry, there's been a lot of issues with the research, many of the inferences I collated just don't tally with the data from the experiments.
Timaeus: On the other hand, some of the conclusions that Albedo derived from his own intuition have been borne out by the facts.
Timaeus: I'm just glad that we've seen some progress, so uh... No reason to be dejected! Albedo said I did a good job!
Timaeus: If you want to hear the results in detail, you'd be better talking to him. I've got work to do.

## Talk 3

Albedo: What's this?
Traveler: Unfamiliar patterns.
Albedo: To the best of my knowledge, these belong to a script of some kind. They can be found all over Teyvat, but they've never given up their secrets.
Albedo: There's still a lot to learn about them, and as for why they should ever have come to rest here... A true mystery.
Albedo: Let me make a copy first. I'll make time to go over them in greater detail after our research.
Paimon: *sigh* Another thing for the "don't understand" list. Unsolvable mystery this, weird experiment that... It'd be nice to get some cool results for once.
Paimon: Seems like if you want the reward, you gotta pay the price.
Albedo: I've truly gained a lot from all this. Comparatively, the little reward I can offer is too small to mention.
Albedo: Let me return to the campsite first. By the time you get back, I may just have a fleeting miracle for you to witness.
Traveler: See you soon.
Paimon: Paimon's kinda looking forward to seeing the result of all this brain ache...
Paimon: Unless you can think of anything better to do, let's head back to the campsite.
Paimon: Missing text (2295717066)
Rosaria: Not so fast. You're not leaving until I'm convinced that nothing dangerous is going on here.
Paimon: Wah! You! You didn't leave the mountain!?
Rosaria: I most certainly did not. And I've witnessed everything that you and Albedo have been up to.
Rosaria: I must say, you let your guards down. Or maybe you were drawn in by his compelling-sounding hypothesis and friendly demeanor?
Traveler: What do you mean?
Rosaria: Taking orders from a complete stranger, drinking anonymous potions, participating in all kinds of strange experiments?
Rosaria: I'd sooner believe you were tricked than that you would be so naive. Or perhaps... you were colluding from the beginning?
Paimon: Sister Rosaria's guard's so high, she can't even see over the top of it!
Traveler: I was just helping him with his research.
Rosaria: It doesn't matter what you think, he could be a saint for all you know. But I understand him a little better than you, Outlander.
Rosaria: I'm only concerned with one thing: whether his alchemy has transformed you into something more sinister.
Paimon: No way! Paimon would've sensed it. And anyway, he didn't even use any alchemy...
Rosaria: With an alchemist of his level, you wouldn't sense a thing.
Rosaria: In any case, I'm not about to let a potential threat back into Mondstadt.
Paimon: So, what're you gonna do?
Traveler: You came here to be sure, so you must have your ways of assuring yourself.
Rosaria: I've gotta hand it to you, you have your moments. If I can be sure that nothing you came into contact with is dangerous, that's good enough for me.
Rosaria: I've investigated everything else. The only items left on the agenda are these symbols.
Paimon: But we don't even know what they mean!
Rosaria: Hmm... That much is true, not to mention... Seems like there's nothing more to them.
Rosaria: But for insurance purposes, I'd better make a copy... Hmm. This is now a location of interest — regular patrols should be set up here.
Rosaria: Now then. All things considered, I deem that you pose no immediate threat.
Rosaria: Which is what I was hoping. I would have been one very unhappy Sister if you'd made me work overtime on your account.
Paimon: ...Overtime?
Rosaria: Before we go our separate ways, Outlander, a word of advice. Don't be so quick to trust Albedo, and don't repeat the same mistakes that you did this time. You made a lot of rash decisions today.
Paimon: She's gone. So stubborn!
Paimon: Mondstadt doesn't have many people like that.
Traveler: Maybe she just lacks security.
Paimon: Huh, never mind her. Let's go see Albedo!
Traveler: Maybe she's just sensitive.
Traveler: I don't think he's a bad person.
Traveler: He has ulterior motives?
Traveler: (I take it I passed the intelligence test.)
Traveler: I feel like I've seen these before...

## Talk 4

Albedo: You're back! Good timing, I've just about reached a conclusion.
Albedo: You took quite a while. Did you get held up on the way back?
Traveler: Not really.
Albedo: Time for the results. We got a myriad of data today, and it was very difficult to finish all the research in one go.
Albedo: But the integral preliminary conclusion that I can offer you is... You're very much like a human from this world.
Traveler: ...
Paimon: You couldn't tell that just by looking?
Paimon: We spent all day working our butts off for that!?
Albedo: Please, I understand that this may have seemed self-evident to you, but in fact nothing in this world should be taken for granted.
Albedo: Have you ever considered that the world of Teyvat may have a natural hostility to outlanders?
Traveler: Only the gods would know.
Albedo: I mentioned the natural laws of this world. You're able to converse with me here without consequence, and nothing seems amiss. But it's arguably a small miracle.
Albedo: The only other life form that, like you, has come here from afar, is the seed that I mentioned. Under the effects of Teyvat's natural laws, it isn't even able to sprout, let alone bloom.
Albedo: But after I observed you, I had another idea.
Albedo: Imitating you helped to inspire my alchemy, and so...
Paimon: Whoa! It looks like — something's appearing!
Albedo: The transition from nothing into something, from shoot to stem... And now to fruition.
Albedo: Is not nurturing otherworldly life also nurturing the world itself?
Paimon: Aww...
Traveler: It was beautiful.
Albedo: *sigh* It would seem that that's as far as we go. A transient bloom of incomparable beauty... Life's proudest achievement.
Paimon: Paimon thought, with all our efforts, it might have bloomed forever. And it didn't even have any fruit...
Albedo: Life is a manifold tapestry of free entities, its value shouldn't derive from how long it stays with us. Even a momentary burst is precious.
Albedo: A short life can be well-lived. A life lived efficiently, lived to perfection, is necessarily one unburdened by loneliness.
Albedo: So, do you understand what I meant about us conversing here arguably being a small miracle?
Traveler: Well, I haven't withered just yet.
Paimon: Eh? Things feel a little heavy right now...
Paimon: #Hehehe, don't be sad, {NICKNAME}, you've got Paimon to look after you.
Paimon: Albedo, Paimon really wants to be your friend.
Albedo: ...Thank you both. Even if dispelling loneliness is not essential for life, it certainly doesn't hurt.
Albedo: #Your help inspired me to discover the means to make a flower bloom, {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: So I'm a helpful specimen?
Albedo: I mean that the time that I've spent traveling with you in the mountains was a valuable journey for me.
Albedo: In the future... If the need arises... Can I solicit your help again?
Traveler: Sure, even if you just want some company, find me anytime.
Albedo: Well... Glad I can count on you.

Albedo: #I made a point throughout of telling {M#him}{F#her} how ordinary the results were...
Albedo: But what was that sediment I saw forming at the bottom of the vial? It should not have been there... What could it mean?
Albedo: Those born of earth are bound by its imperfections, but those born of chalk are free of impurities... You and I are alike, both composed of a substance that has yet to be fully defined...
Albedo: If one day, I lose control... destroy Mondstadt... destroy everything...
Albedo: Can I rely on you to stop me?
Traveler: #(I wonder how my {F#brother}{M#sister} is...)
Traveler: It was so short-lived.
Traveler: Perhaps.
Traveler: That's it?
Traveler: Quite literally, by a sister no less.
Albedo: Aha, I wouldn't worry, she's just doing her job.
