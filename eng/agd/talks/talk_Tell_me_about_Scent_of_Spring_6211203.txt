Traveler: Tell me about Scent of Spring.
Qingbai: It's the top pottery workshop in Liyue. They're experts in every part of their craft, from shaping the clay, to firing in the kiln, to glazing the finished product...
Qingbai: ...Only thing is, that shopkeeper of theirs has a certain way with words that tends to make the mind wander...
Qingbai: But not me, of course. Straight-laced guy like me? Nothing but pure thoughts.
Traveler: I thought today was your last day...
Qingbai: I, uh... I was just trying to accommodate you. Don't want you missing out now, do we?
Qingbai: If you like the store, I'll keep it open forever, just for you. How 'bout that?
