Traveler: Who are you?
Qian: I work as a miner, or at least that's what I used to do. Now that the Chasm's been sealed off, I just wander around without a job to do.
Qian: I've heard that limited production has resumed, but I wasn't put on the list of workers.
Qian: Maybe if I had something to do, I wouldn't be so picky about what to eat. But now that I've already tried all the places around here, I don't have a clue what I want to eat today.

Traveler: Are you sure you'll be alright unemployed?
Qian: You needn't worry!
Qian: Seeing as you don't appear to be a Millelith, I'll let you in on something.
Qian: When I was working down in the Chasm, I moved some raw materials out on the sly. I'm talking real high quality stuff, like what Shitou has at The Jade Mystery. People would buy it by the boatload!
Qian: Actually, I've been looking for a partner. Whaddya think? Are you in?
Qian: Imagine, you'll be able to eat and drink whatever you please, just as if Yujing Terrace was your very own kitchen!

Traveler: Isn't that against the law?
Qian: What are you trying to say? ...You're not going to turn me in to the Millelith, are you?
Qian: ...Ugh, fine, just take these. They're left over from my mining days.
Qian: Now... mum's the word, you got it? Not a whisper of this, not to anybody!

## Talk 3

Qian: *sigh* Seems like I've already tried every place there is to eat around here, and I'm already tired of all of them...
Qian: What a bother, I guess I'll have to go someplace further.

Traveler: Is there anything good to eat?
Qian: Hmm, from my sampling, there's really not much to those big restaurants.
Qian: Li Cuisine, Yue Cuisine, delicacies and delectables... What matters is the concept and atmosphere. And if you really want to know what's best, I say it has to be the snacks at Chihu Rock!
Qian: Zhongyuan Chop Suey, Grilled Tiger Fish... When Rex Lapis came to visit Chihu Rock back in the day, he too was enticed by the smells of the roadside stalls.
Qian: The accumulated aromas of a thousand years waft through this street. All who pass through can't help but salivate!
