## Talk 1

Ipe: You're pretty good at fishing! Reckon there's room for improvement, though!
Traveler: Eh!?
Ipe: Ahaha, sorry, sorry... I always forget to say hi and all. Easy to forget that I might scare people, you know?
Traveler: Doesn't seem to stop you from enjoying it...
Ipe: Aw, come on~ Scaring kids is fun from time to time, don'cha think?
Ipe: *cough* Anyway, let's get back to talking about fishing.
Traveler: What, is it serious business?
Ipe: Well, so, I know this isn't the best look... But when I was fishing earlier, I dropped the charm that Makiri gave me. It's got blessings from her ancestral spirits and the Great Thunderbird in it.
Ipe: I... I don't know what I'd tell her if she found out that I lost it after we board the boat...
Ipe: The golden boat-guy said that he'd scrounge some people up to help me search, but it doesn't look like anyone's coming! So I thought that since you're here, you can help me out too!
Traveler: And here I thought you were the reliable one...
Ipe: My usual fishing spot's just over there, but... my memory's getting weaker and weaker somehow, so I'm afraid that I've gotta leave it to you to help me search...
Traveler: Since it's a place of ancient memory...
Ipe: Eh? What do you mean? Is this some way in which you outsiders find things?
Ipe: *sigh* Well, whatever it might be, you should be able to find the charm as long as you find the right spot.
Traveler: And how will I search for the charm itself?
Ipe: Uhh... By fishing it out of the water?
Traveler: ...I guess that works.
Ipe: Thank you, friend from afar! May the Great Thunderbird and our ancestors protect you!
Traveler: I guess the "feather" should do the trick...
Traveler: You're hopeless...
Ipe: There is an isle west of the Autake Plains that faces three waterfalls. It should be in the sea further west of that small island...
Traveler: You really love fishing, don't you...
Traveler: What happened to greeting before deciding to just show up?

## Talk 2

Ipe: Thank you so much! Now I can finally board the boat in peace...
Traveler: Where is that boat going, anyway?
Ipe: To the land of gold, the land of dreams. A realm with no fog. We'll meet again in dreams, friend.

## Talk 3

Ipe: Hey! You're back!
Traveler: Is this what you were looking for?

## Talk 4

Ipe: You're back! Did you find the charm?
Traveler: I need a bit more time.
Ipe: Ah, I see, I see. No rush, y'know? Stay safe while you're at it too, friend from afar.
Ipe: You'll find an isle west of the Autake Plains that faces three waterfalls. The charm I'm searching for is in the waters west of that small island...
