Slime Breeder: I've been raising 3 Slimes. They like to be lifted up in the air and especially enjoy jumping through hoops.
Slime Breeder: They go faster when you use Acting Grand Master Jean's *Gale Blade* though.
How about making the Slimes jump through 10 hoops before time runs out! It'll make them happy! Wanna try?
