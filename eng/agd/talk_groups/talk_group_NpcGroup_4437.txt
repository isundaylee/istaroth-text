Traveler: You're still here?
Tanjiyy: Haha, yeah, I've reported everything I discovered to the Akademiya and applied for a new project...
Tanjiyy: Now, I'm going to figure out what on earth happened here...
Tanjiyy: Mm, this will add a nice footnote to my historical research.
Tanjiyy: Don't worry about my safety. The General Mahamatra's keeping an eye out for us. He's promised to provide abundant supplies and protection for the researchers sent here.

Traveler: How about a round of Genius Invokation TCG?
Tanjiyy: Haha, a fellow player, huh? Lucky me!

Traveler: Historical research...?
Tanjiyy: Yeah, why do you look so surprised?
Tanjiyy: The legend of the God King is part of history, Parvezravan's family affairs are part of history... and so is the mysterious tragedy of the Tanit.
Tanjiyy: To put it simply, think about these questions: How do we piece together the fragmented truth?
Tanjiyy: What purpose did the record-keeper hold when they wrote down those words? What were they thinking?
Tanjiyy: ...All of them are history.

Traveler: Did you find anything?
Tanjiyy: Did I find anything? Hmm... How about a remaining belief in the Goddess of Flowers? Eh, I'm afraid whatever is left of that belief has been wiped out now — it's gone for good.
Tanjiyy: And... I found many books smuggled out of the Akademiya. The amount is very huge if I do say so.
Tanjiyy: Some of which are completely foreign to me... Uh, for instance... there are books about "films." What did they want these for?
Tanjiyy: But apparently, we were wrong to presume that the desert folks were illiterate fools who would turn their noses up at knowledge... They were truly extraordinary.
