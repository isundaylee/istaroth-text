Traveler: What did you offer?
Shouta: Whâ€”What do you want? Are you planning to take these snacks?
Shouta: You can't do that! You'll bring bad luck onto yourself if you steal other people's offerings!
Shouta: Uhh... How about I give these Onikabuto to you?
Shouta: I caught them with my friends. They don't seem like something I can offer to the deities. You can have them, but in return, don't touch my snacks, okay?
