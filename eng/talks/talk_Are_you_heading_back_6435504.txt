Traveler: Are you heading back?
Maziar: Hmm, not now. I just passed a camp of the Eremites, and he was not there. Maybe he went to the hotel looking for me for a drink.
Maziar: To be honest, most Sumeru people like to drink, but I'm not used to alcohol. I would feel dizzy after just half a glass.
Maziar: But it'd be a lack of decorum to refuse an Eremite. He often comes to invite me for a drink, and I should care about his feelings.
Maziar: I'll just stay out of his sight for now.
