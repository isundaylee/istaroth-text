Shaoyuan's Tomb: (The writing on this tombstone is dense, recording the dates of birth and death of the deceased as well as some details about their life. It's in excellent condition, and there's the smell of wine in the area â€” someone must have cleaned this tombstone recently and also made an offering of wine.)
