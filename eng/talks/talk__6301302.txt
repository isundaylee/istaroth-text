Heihachi: What are you staring at me for?
Heihachi: This tea's absolutely disgusting, by the way! Give me a crow's spittle any day!
Heihachi: Pfah. Never mind the tea, even the scenery is bad, what with all these outlanders skulking about in an Inazuman shop.
Heihachi: And they say that this is some high-end pad that only serves an upper class clientele... Hmph. This place might as well be a straw hut as far as I'm concerned.
Heihachi: If it weren't for an official assignment, I wouldn't have wanted to be here.
