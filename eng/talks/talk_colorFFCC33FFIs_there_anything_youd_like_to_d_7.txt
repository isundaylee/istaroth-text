# Talk Dialog

Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Is there anything you'd like to do?</color>
Xiao: If you have free time, we can go to Liyue Harbor together...
Xiao: If not... never mind.
Traveler: Of course we can.
Xiao: Uh... alright.
Xiao: I have no intention of getting close to the lives of mortals.
Xiao: But I know that you often enter and leave the city, walking amidst the crowd.
Xiao: The stories of these times, or their joys... If I don't experience such things myself, it'll be hard to understand your thoughts.
Traveler: So... you're doing this for me?
Xiao: Yes, to understand you.
Xiao: I had a feeling that it would be difficult, but after having such thoughts, I can't simply sit back and do nothing.
Xiao: I will control myself while I am in the city.
Xiao: I'll try to speak... as little as possible.
Traveler: I'll be with you.
Xiao: Hmm...
Xiao: Let me know when you're ready to go.
Traveler: You can say whatever you want. I'll bail you out.
Traveler: Finally decided to integrate into city life?
Xiao: Ahem...
