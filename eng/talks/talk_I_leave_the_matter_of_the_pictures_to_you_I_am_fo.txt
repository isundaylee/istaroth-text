Ootomo: I leave the matter of the pictures to you. I am fortunate indeed to have met people of such fine artistic tastes as you and Lenne.
Lenne: Indeed, indeed. Well then, friend, might I ask what your name is? I believe neither of us are acquainted with it.

Lenne: A most uncommon name. But it is no crime to stand out from the crowd. I shall remember it.
Ootomo: #{NICKNAME}, mm? I'll remember it as well.
