Dr. Edith: Hmm, instead of celebrating the festival in the city, you're out here in the wilderness adventuring...
Dr. Edith: Are you, perchance, also searching for the Windblume?
Dr. Edith: As far as I'm aware, "Windblume" was possibly once a code word for people who wished to stay in contact and plot resistance in secret...
Dr. Edith: But with the changing of the times, the relational understanding between the people and the idea of the Windblume has also shifted.
Dr. Edith: In this modern age of peace and freedom, beyond just the Mondstadters, the peoples of other nations might instill a new significance into the Windblume Festival.
Dr. Edith: If such is the case then, the very meaning behind the Windblume itself will likely be varied in expression.
