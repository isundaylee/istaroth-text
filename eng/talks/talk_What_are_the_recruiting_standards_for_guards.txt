Traveler: What are the recruiting standards for guards?
Hanqian: Good question.
Hanqian: You must be agile, patient, good with directions, observant, and have a quick mind. These are all necessary qualities.
Hanqian: You need them to defeat bandits and monsters while on a job, so you can escort whatever you're delivering to the destination safely.
Hanqian: Most importantly, and many ignore this, you need to have chivalry.
Hanqian: You must not be tempted by money. There was once a real scumbag who colluded with the bandits during a job and seized the goods.
Hanqian: Many guards went after him as a result, handing him his sorry arse before handing him over to the Millelith.
Hanqian: The stuff he stole? Returned, and he was forced to pay all he had as compensation â€” on top of spending the rest of his life in prison.
Hanqian: Anyway, I digress. You must be chivalrous and righteous.
