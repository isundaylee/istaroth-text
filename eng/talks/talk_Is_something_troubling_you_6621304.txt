Traveler: Is something troubling you?
Matla: Know that sometimes, helping others with their treatment is no different from becoming an active part of their lives.
Matla: This is especially true for those who have chronic illnesses, such as those afflicted with Abyssal corrosion.
Matla: In such cases, I regularly compile medical reports and keep a running record of their condition. As such, it is inevitable that I occasionally find myself dwelling upon such thoughts.
Matla: Yet this can have negative effects on my own health.
Matla: It is hard for doctors to cure themselves, though, so all I can hope for is to temporarily free my mind of these troubles through meditation.
