Traveler: About Butter...
Muirne: Whenever I go to eat some bread, they never give me enough butter to spread on it. I'm thinking that maybe I should just bring butter with me in the future.
Muirne: Did you bring the butter?
Traveler: Butter's ready.
Traveler: Not yet.
Muirne: I want a buttload of butter, so I can wait 'til you can give it to me all at once.

Traveler: What's on your mind?
Muirne: A lot of things. Sometimes I think of more and more things, and I stand for longer periods of time.
Muirne: Once, Monsieur Neuvillette saw me watching the sea, and he stood beside me in deep thought.
Muirne: And slowly, more and more people started gathering behind us.
Muirne: Everyone was tiptoeing to watch the sea, muttering to themselves, "is something happening out there?"
Muirne: Humans are so cute.
Muirne: But in truth, the thing I was considering was very simple. It's an everyday thing — what am I going to eat later?
