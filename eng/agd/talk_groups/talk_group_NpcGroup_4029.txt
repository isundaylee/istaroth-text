Traveler: And you are...
Shevirme: I own a stall here selling drinks, snacks, and stuff like that.
Shevirme: My food is reasonably priced. A popular choice for student meals, welcome parties, and team-building alike!
Shevirme: And I even got the Mahamata among my clients, too! One bought a whole case of wine!

Traveler: Make a fool of myself?
Shevirme: That's right. Now, don't tell anyone, but this happened a few days ago. Two groups of researchers were drinking in the tavern and they ended up fighting.
Shevirme: Y'know, those researchers are usually so reserved and polite, even eating roast meat with small bites. But they can also really go at it, huh?
Shevirme: I think it was a fight over who is the best candidate for the Grand Conservator position. They started arguing, then fists flew. Soon, the matra came and took them all away.
Shevirme: Looks like no matter how well-read you are, you still succumb to a few glasses of alcohol, eh?

Traveler: Sounds like a heavy drinker.
Shevirme: Haha, I actually have no idea what he does, but folks say he's a Mahamata.
Shevirme: He was tall and looked like a guy who could hold his drink. But I couldn't tell if he bought the wine for himself or for someone else...
Shevirme: I remember him murmuring something like "one case should be enough for an apology" as he carried the wine.
Shevirme: ...Say, maybe he wanted to get someone drunk so that they'll forget his mistakes?
