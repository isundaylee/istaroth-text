# Wind-Riding Knight

Amber (???): May the Anemo God protect you, stranger!
Amber: I am Amber, Outrider for the Knights of Favonius.
Amber: You don't look like citizens of Mondstadt. Explain yourselves!
Paimon: We're not looking for trouble.
Amber: That's what all the troublemakers say.
Traveler: #Hello, I'm Traveler.
Amber: ...Doesn't sound like a local name to me.
Amber: And this... mascot, what's the deal with it?
Traveler: We're friends.
Paimon: We've only been traveling partners for two months, but...
Paimon: We've already become the very best of friends!
Amber: So to sum it up, you're traveling partners, right?
Amber: Well look, there's been a large dragon sighted around Mondstadt recently. Best you get inside the city as soon as possible.
Amber: It's not far from here, I'll escort you there.
Paimon: Oh? Aren't you out here for some other reason?
Amber: I am. But not to worry, I can keep you both safe while doing that too.
Amber: Besides... I'm still not sure if I can trust you two just yet!
Traveler: Why so suspicious?
Amber: Oh, ahh... I'm sorry. Probably not something I should say as a knight.
Amber: I give you my apologies, uh... strange yet... respectable travelers.
Paimon: That sounded so fake!
Amber: Do you have something against the type of language usage prescribed by the Knights of Favonius Handbook!?
Traveler: That's a rather rude way to speak to guests.
Traveler: Emergency food.
Paimon: Hey! That's even worse than being a mascot!
