# Snowy Silhouette: Hope


## Talk 1

Joel: Will I really find Dad this time...
Traveler: Any news about your father?
Joel: Oh, it's you!
Joel: Pallad told me that Uncle Cyrus might have found some news about my dad.
Joel: He can't be sure yet, but according to Pallad, their latest leads seem pretty promising, so they might just find him.
Joel: I'd love to go up Dragonspine with them, but Uncle Cyrus says that I should stay in the camp, and that they'll tell me once they get more news...
Joel: Could you help me look for Uncle Cyrus and ask him, please?
Traveler: I've got it.
Joel: I... I'm afraid that the news... might be bad...
Joel: Either way... I'm counting on you!
Traveler: Not going yourself?

## Talk 2

Cyrus: In this area, huh... Are you sure, Pallad?
Reckless Pallad: I'm very sure, Mr. Cyrus.
Traveler: Discussing Joel's dad?
Cyrus: Ah, if it isn't the Traveler! Joel sent you, I'll wager.
Cyrus: That child has asked someone to come ask us for news practically every day...
Cyrus: This time, though... We've got some good news for him, haha!
Cyrus: Previously, we were organizing some special training on Dragonspine...
Reckless Pallad: It might be best if I explained the rest, Mr. Cyrus.
Reckless Pallad: So, while taking part in that training, I wound up straying from the arranged path due to a huge blizzard.
Reckless Pallad: As I was groping my way back on track, I saw a blurred silhouette on a cliff.
Reckless Pallad: I thought that this must be a lost adventurer, just like myself, so I yelled for their attention.
Reckless Pallad: Unfortunately, before I could attract that person's attention... My cries attracted some monsters first.
Reckless Pallad: Now I don't know about you, but I wasn't confident that I could take them on in such conditions, so I beat a hasty retreat.
Reckless Pallad: Once I got back, I related the matter to Mr. Cyrus.
Traveler: So the person you saw was Joel's father?
Cyrus: We're not sure ourselves.
Cyrus: Regardless, at least now we know that *someone* is trapped on Dragonspine. As such, I believe a rescue is in order.
Cyrus: Whether that person is Joel's father Joserf or not... Now that is up to fortune.
Cyrus: Either way, I've already dispatched all with the capability to explore Dragonspine to fan out and search.
Reckless Pallad: I'll get ready as well.
Traveler: I'll come along.
Reckless Pallad: Really? That's amazing! Let's head out together, then.
Traveler: I'll go beat those monsters up.
Traveler: That could have been any old lost adventurer, you know...

## Talk 3

Reckless Pallad: Well, at least this area's safe now. Thanks a lot.
Traveler: About Joserf...
Reckless Pallad: Unfortunately, I didn't find anything earlier, either.
Reckless Pallad: However, since the coast is clear, I'll continue my search now.
Reckless Pallad: Would you mind helping me make a trip back to inform Mr. Cyrus that I've begun search efforts? Thanks!

## Talk 4

Cyrus: Ah, Traveler, you've returned!
Traveler: Pallad has begun searching.
Cyrus: Has he now? Hah! I knew he always had a responsible bone in him somewhere...
Cyrus: Once I've finished the matters I have on hand, I'll go to Dragonspine to check on that boy Joel myself and give him the news.
Cyrus: So if you would, please tell him that I'll be right with him shortly.
Cyrus: It will take a moment for me to finish my work. Don't keep the lad waiting, now!
Traveler: Will we really find that person?
Cyrus: ...Well, there's no guarantee, of course. I can only say that we'll do all we can.

## Talk 5

Joel: Hey there! What's the latest news?
Joel: Oh... So Uncle Cyrus hasn't found my dad yet, right?
Traveler: Have a little faith in him.
Joel: I know... I'll ask Uncle Cyrus for more details when he gets here, then. Thanks a bunch!
Joel: Where are you, Daddy...
Traveler: They've got some clues, at least.

## Talk 6

Joel: Please help me look for Uncle Cyrus and ask him...

## Talk 7

Cyrus: There's little time to lose...

## Talk 8

Cyrus: So if you would, please tell him that I'll be right with him shortly.
Cyrus: It will take a moment for me to finish my work. Don't keep the lad waiting, now!
