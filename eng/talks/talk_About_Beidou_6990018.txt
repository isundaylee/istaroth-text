Traveler: About Beidou
Paimon: How do you become as popular and cool as Captain Beidou?
Traveler: With enough experience...
Paimon: Paimon's already seen lots of things from adventuring together with you!
Traveler: One also needs to experience trials and setbacks...
Paimon: Paimon almost drowned that one time...
Traveler: ...Maintain an inspirational disposition...
Paimon: Uh-huh! Paimon's always rooted for you!
Traveler: One must also have a mature outlook towards problems...
Paimon: Hey! Are you just trying to say that Paimon can't make it?
