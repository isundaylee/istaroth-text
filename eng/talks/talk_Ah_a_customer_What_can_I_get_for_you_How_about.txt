# Talk Dialog

Yi'nian: Ah, a customer! What can I get for you? How about some Lantern Rite specialties? We only make them once a year!
Traveler: I'd like to buy a snack.
Yi'nian: Certainly! Take a look and decide for yourself. I can do anything on the menu. Or if there's something in particular you're after, I can do that instead!
Traveler: How's business these days?
Yi'nian: Haha, business is better than ever. Thanks for asking.
Yi'nian: But if you ask me, making good food is what really counts. Perfecting tasty snacks is time well spent, rather than thinking all day about how to make more advertisements.
Yi'nian: If it's good, it'll sell itself. At least, that's what I think. I don't need any boring advice from Wang'ya.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Yi'nian: Take care. Please come again!
