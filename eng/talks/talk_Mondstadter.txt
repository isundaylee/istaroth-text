Traveler: Mondstadter?
Bhai: The old man over there, who is constantly murmuring, "May the Anemo Archon bless us."
Bhai: I don't have anything against the Anemo Archon but I think the old man is trapped in the wind, he's going nowhere.
Bhai: His wife was a smart and capable captain of a merchant fleet, and I was her chief mate.
Bhai: *sigh* If she saw that old guy behaving like this, she'd rise from the ground and slap him right on the head!
