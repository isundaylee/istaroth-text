Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Big-Footed Dajiao: Heh, even though we've already gone through all the motions of the Rite of Parting, I still don't really believe that the Lord of Geo is dead.
Big-Footed Dajiao: If you ask me, this whole thing is just a big scheme by the Qixing. They're undoubtedly the ones pulling all the strings behind the scenes.
Big-Footed Dajiao: ... Well, that's my two cents, at least. But don't you go around telling everybody what I think now, ya hear?
