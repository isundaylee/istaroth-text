Traveler: Hello.
Mutota: Hello there. Welcome to the Flower-Feather Clan.
Mutota: As the chief, I don't want to seem too strict or lay too many rules down, but living here does take a little care and patience.
Mutota: The Qucusaurus is the proudest Saurian in Natlan, as are many of their riders.
Mutota: But once they're in battle, people soon discover that arrogance is no help in attaining victory.
Mutota: Scars may be a warrior's badge of honor, but they're also a reminder of mistakes made.
Mutota: ...I'm sorry. Have I been blabbing on too long? What I meant to say is: Please be extra careful.
