Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hmm? Oh, did you make the trip all the way back here just to see me?
Traveler: About the thieves...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ah, so that's what you uncovered in the end. Hmm, I'm not quite sure how I feel about that.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: But thank you for letting me know.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hearing how things ended almost feels like reading the end of a light novel. Now we can all rest at ease.
Traveler: About the tournament...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: "Winning or losing isn't what's most important. It's about playing with elegance." That's how I've always looked at it, anyway.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: After seeing you all cheering for me though, I suppose I really tried to bring my best to the game.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hehe... Now that I think about it, it was great that I was able to speak with you before the competition.
Traveler: Energy +5?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ah! No, please don't ever mention that to anyone!
Traveler: I'll be on my way, then.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Since you came all the way to Watatsumi Island, you might as well rest for a moment before you return.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I hope this view will stay in your heart forever.
