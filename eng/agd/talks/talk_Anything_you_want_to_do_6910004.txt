# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Kachina: Let me think. Hmm... Nope, nothing in particular.
Kachina: I'm quite content at the moment. In fact, it's more than that... I'm happy.
Traveler: You sure you're not just putting on a brave face?
Kachina: Hehe, of course not! I doubt I could fool you, anyway — you know me too well by this point.
Kachina: I'm really enjoying my time here. Once I got used to it, I realized that your home's kind of like a dream world... the kind of thing you read about in storybooks.
Kachina: It's not just the beautiful scenery, either. I love all this open space! It's so much fun just riding around the place on Turbo Twirly.
Kachina: The pace of life here is so nice, too. I could stay here forever.
Traveler: Glad to hear it.
Kachina: Heh~ Once again, thank you so, so much for inviting me here... My family's always telling me, you can never thank someone too much!
Kachina: By the way, would you like to visit my home sometime?
Kachina: ...Ah!
Traveler: What's wrong?
Kachina: N—Nothing... I just suddenly remembered all the piles of stuff in my room... I gotta take care of that before you come over.
Kachina: There's still a few boxes left under my bed... and my top shelves are empty... Yeah, that should do the trick.
Traveler: There's no need to tidy up for me.
Kachina: Oh... Thanks, it's really nice of you to say that! I... feel a lot more confident now.
Traveler: Relax, it'll be fine.
Kachina: Hehe, so it's decided then? I'll have every stone in its proper place by the time you arrive!
Kachina: And that's a promise! Even if it's crowded, it's still gotta look nice.
Traveler: A crowded house is a house with character.
