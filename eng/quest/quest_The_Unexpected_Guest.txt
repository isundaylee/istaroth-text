# The Unexpected Guest


## Talk 1

Paimon: Whoa... Well, this place is just as creepy as Paimon remembers it. If it wasn't for our little investigation, Paimon wouldn't ever come anywhere near this place.
Paimon: Huh? Hey look, there's someone over there!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Ugh... Ouch...
Paimon: #Wh—What happened? Hey, Traveler, are you alright?
Traveler: I'm fine.
Yanfei: Oww... putting my books under me to break the fall didn't help at all.
Yelan: What's this?
Paimon: Wh—Where are we...?
Arataki Itto: Ugh, gonna feel that in the morning... Hey, Shinobu, Traveler... and my savior! Is everyone okay?
Kuki Shinobu: *sigh* Well, this is an unfortunate turn of events.
Paimon: Hey, so uh, how far down did we fall?
Yelan: ...
Yelan: It seems the ground collapsed during our little confrontation up there. Perhaps because we triggered the elemental forces...
Arataki Itto: Well, don't look at me. If you weren't so rude, maybe I wouldn't have gotten mad. Who can put up with that kind of 'tude?
Yelan: It's my duty to stop intruders from breaking into important places. If telling the truth sounds rude, then I'm afraid you're just a little too fragile.
Arataki Itto: Hey! Life's too short to give in all the time!
Kuki Shinobu: Boss, I'm afraid you're not going to win this argument. I suggest we stop provoking her.
Arataki Itto: Hey, whose side are you on here?
Kuki Shinobu: I'm simply pointing out the facts. I understand how you feel, but you're making my life difficult by starting random fights with everyone.
Paimon: Heh, looks like Itto can't argue against either Yelan or Shinobu... He's in a real tough spot now...
Traveler: So Itto and Shinobu are kinda like you and me.
Paimon: Huh? Hey! What do you mean? Don't you dare compare Paimon to Itto!
Arataki Itto: Whoa, whoa! What do YOU mean? You lookin' for a fight too?
Paimon: P—Paimon was just saying how it is... Everyone knows you're a bit of an idiot.
Arataki Itto: You calling me an idiot!? Oh yeah, well you're a puny little flying Lavender Melon. Hah!
Paimon: Flying Lavender Melon? Ohhh that's it, Paimon's mad! Time to give you an ugly nickname... Uh, Bull-Chucker! Hmph, you better mind your manners, Bull-Chucker.
Yanfei: We seem to be a long way down from where we fell. It's impossible to see what's going on up above.
Yelan: It's unlikely we'll be able to climb back up that far. We'll need to find another way.
Yelan: I'm sorry to interrupt your lovely little chat here, but I think there's something you may need to know.
Yelan: The Chasm is regarded as a mysterious area in Liyue. It was sealed off for years due to a mining accident. Whatever goes on down here, I suggest you remember this: You didn't see anything, you didn't hear anything, and you're not gonna ask any questions. Save you from getting caught up in things you shouldn't know about.
Yelan: I won't treat you as hostiles, and in exchange, I hope you won't make things difficult when it comes to keeping secrets. I'll do what I can to find a way out.
Arataki Itto: Huh? Where does she think she's going?
Yanfei: Like she said, to search for an exit. Chances are that Yelan is the best among us at survival and handling emergencies, we should just let her go.
Yanfei: I'm afraid I must apologize... I don't typically disclose details of a client's will to third parties, which is why I couldn't tell you the truth... I'm sorry.
Yanfei: I came to The Chasm in search of the Fantastic Compass, which is mentioned in the will. Many years ago, my client gave this magical device to someone ambitious, hoping that it'd be handy in times of need.
Yanfei: According to an eye-witness account, the person who received the device took it into The Chasm and has been missing ever since.
Yanfei: Throughout history, many wars have been fought in the vicinity of The Chasm. Even if that person died in one of the wars, I still wish to do my utmost and find the device, and fulfill the client's wish.
Yanfei: Yelan's words of caution were not unwarranted. There are dangers lurking in The Chasm... I'm sure you've all realized that by now. Given that we're all caught in this mess, let's try to find a way out together.
Arataki Itto: Whatever you say, my savior... I'll do whatever you ask. From now on, we're a team, all of us. And as for that big jerk... Well, hmph, I guess that includes her, too.
Paimon: You said Yelan works for the Ministry of Civil Affairs, huh? Paimon could tell she's tougher than most, but wow, her job sounds demanding.
Yanfei: Well, that's what she tells outsiders... I can't disclose too much about her identity, but I'd say she's the only person who can handle this type of work.
Arataki Itto: What kind of lame job would have someone go out to the middle of nowhere?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon knows! An adventurer!
Traveler: ???
Paimon: Hey, what's with the face? Did Paimon say something wrong? That's literally what the two of us do, isn't it?
Traveler: I'm the adventurer, Paimon. Not you.
Paimon: Ugh, you're so stingy these days... Just let Paimon be an adventurer by association, okay?
Arataki Itto: #Yeah, she's got a point, Traveler, you're Paimon's boss. Take it from me, as a great leader, you should learn to be a little more generous... You know, let your sidekick share some of the glory.
Paimon: Ugh, you really don't understand anything about us!
Kuki Shinobu: Paimon, don't take him too seriously. He's just joking.
Paimon: Hmph, for the sake of Shinobu... Fine.
Arataki Itto: Hmph, I'm the boss, so I'll let it slide.
Yelan: ...
Yelan: Perhaps this was another sealed location, but an undocumented one... What could be in here?
Kuki Shinobu: I've got some food and water on me. If anyone needs some, just let me know.
Paimon: Great! You know, Bull-Chucker, you may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but your subordinate here seems super capable and reliable!
Arataki Itto: Hehe, I know, isn't she the best... Hey! I am too a sharp tool!
Yelan: There seems to be an entrance up ahead with a path inside.
Paimon: Wonder where it leads to... Well, let's go take a look.
Traveler: Did we fall... into this place?

## Talk 3

Paimon: Who woulda guessed we'd find a Domain entrance in a place like this...
Arataki Itto: If there's a way in, then there's a way out. Let's go and take a look.
Yanfei: The rocks here seem to be old Liyue Mountain Rocks, they're similar to what I've seen in books. This domain must have existed for quite some time now.
Yelan: ...!
Yelan: (What's that sound?)
Xiao (???): ...
Traveler: ...!
Paimon: Ah! Oh, it's Xiao!
Yanfei: Conqueror of Demons? What are you doing here?
Yelan: ...
Xiao: Oh, I came down from above. I heard a noise, so I followed it here.
Paimon: So you're not here by accident. Wanna team up?
Xiao: No, I have something else to do.
Traveler: Is it something important?
Xiao: ...I'm looking for someone.
Xiao: You shouldn't be here. I would urge you to go back as soon as possible.
Paimon: Well, that's Xiao for ya... Shows up without warning and disappears without a trace.
Arataki Itto: Heh, that guy looked pretty tough, maybe almost as tough as me. Seems like a solid dude.
Paimon: Seriously, Bull-Chucker, where do you get your confidence from...?
Kuki Shinobu: Should we really be letting him go off on his own?
Paimon: Oh, he wouldn't listen, no matter how much you tried to talk him out of it... He is super tough, though, so don't worry about him.
Yelan: Everyone, keep your eyes and ears peeled from here on out. We don't know what lies ahead, so we have to be ready for anything.
Arataki Itto: Oh, look, I'm happy to say we're all on the same team and everything, but... could you cut the little speeches and the whole follow-the-leader act? I, for one, think I should be able to look after myself...
Kuki Shinobu: Boss!
Arataki Itto: Ugh, okay, okayyy!
Paimon: Besides, Yelan is just looking out for everyone. You know, Bull-Chucker, you're a guest here, so maybe try to get along with everyone.
Arataki Itto: Hah! Please! You're not a local either, Flying Lavender Melon, so stop trying to sound like one!
