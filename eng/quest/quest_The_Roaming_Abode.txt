# The Roaming Abode


## Talk 1

???: Grandpa...
Paimon: Hmm? Hey there, kiddo, what are you doing out here at night? What's your name?
???: I'm Xiangjun... I'm looking for my Grandpa... He was kidnapped by demons...
Paimon: D—Demons? Here? What sort?
???: I... I don't know either... Grandpa said that they're in the mountains, so I shouldn't run around by myself... But it's been three days now, and he still isn't back from the mountains...
Traveler: He's just trying to scare you, right?
Paimon: Paimon thinks so too... Did he say what he was doing in those mountains?
???: Grandpa's the village's herb gatherer. He found a divine plant recently, one that's said to only grow when watered with the blessed waters near Mt. Xuanlian.
???: So... Might he have bumped into some kind of demon guarding the water?
Paimon: Don't worry too much, Xiangjun. Your Grandpa might've just encountered some minor trouble. But it's also getting really late — mind if we send you home first?
???: But I want to rescue him...
Traveler: We can help you.
???: Really?
Paimon: That's right! But if you don't go home, you might cause your Grandpa even more trouble.
???: Ah, I... don't want to do that.
Paimon: Then let us look for him while you stay home, alright? Let's get you back to your home first.
???: It's fine. I live in Qiaoying Village. I can head back myself.
???: But... could you go look for Grandpa immediately? I'm worried about him...
Paimon: Oh, we'll be fine. That said... do you know where exactly he went?
???: I only know that he went that way...
Traveler: In that case, that's where we'll start.
???: Thanks so much! I'll head back now. I won't cause you all any trouble... so I'll wait there for you!

## Talk 2

Someone's Notes: "I overslept! I have to get back before tomorrow, or no one's going to watch Xiangjun... Ah, I'm a fool...!"
Someone's Notes: "If I remember right, there's a shortcut — a small road leading from Yaodie Valley to Mt. Xuanlian. Just need to get through that plus one mountain cave, and I should be golden..."
Someone's Notes: "I've heard that there are monsters nearby, but I have to give this a shot..."
Paimon: This looks like something that her grandpa might've left behind. Seems like he took a small trail — let's go look for it as well!

## Talk 3

Someone's Notes: "...I was worried about monsters from the start, but..."
Someone's Notes: "...So much... My thigh... Can't stop it..."
Someone's Notes: "...So sleepy... But Mt. Xuanlian is just up ahead... Xiangjun, I'll definitely get those blessed waters..."
Someone's Notes: "Xiangjun... I'll surely get those blessed waters..."
Paimon: Oh no... He was attacked by monsters and was badly wounded in the process... Wait, and he still wants to get water from Mt. Xuanlian even so!?
Paimon: Let's hurry — Paimon hopes we can help him!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Hmm. This should be the place, right?
Paimon: Why isn't anyone here? No trail to follow, either...
Traveler: Could he have gone back already?
Paimon: Paimon doesn't think that would happen. He's been injured — could he have walked far?
Traveler: But he's not around here either.
Paimon: Could someone have met him on the road and rescued him? Paimon thinks that might have happened...
Paimon: Shall we go back to Qiaoying Village and ask around?
Traveler: Let's get a bit of this "blessed water" first.
Paimon: Huh? Oh, right. If Xiangjun's Grandpa was rescued, he might still need this.
Paimon: #In for a Mora, in for it all, eh? You're so thoughtful, {NICKNAME}.

## Talk 5

Uncle Luo: Ah, it's you, Traveler. You seem in a terrible hurry. Did some trouble come up?
Paimon: We... Well, do you know where Xiangjun and her grandfather live, Uncle Luo? We're looking for them.
Uncle Luo: Xiangjun? Never heard of her. Is she from around here? I'm sure I know everyone in the village...
Paimon: Really? That can't be... We met a little girl outside who called herself Xiangjun, and said she lives in Qiaoying Village. She asked us to help her find her grandfather...
Paimon: She also has a big bamboo raft!
Uncle Luo: Well, you can find those quite easily, but Xiangjun... I'm fairly sure there's no one by that name in our village. What does her grandfather go by?
Traveler: He's an herb gatherer.
Uncle Luo: A herb gatherer? Let me think. We did have one, so I recall... But it's been three years since he passed...
Paimon: He passed away!?
Uncle Luo: Aye. He encountered monsters in the wild and... *sigh* Still, I doubt that's who you're looking for.
Uncle Luo: He was always a little off his rocker, and he never got married, never mind having descendants of any sort.
Paimon: Wait... What's going on here? So, that Xiangjun we met...
Paimon: ...Could she have been the real demon!?
Traveler: What sorts of herbs did your herb gatherer, well, gather?
Uncle Luo: Flowers and grasses, none of which we've ever seen. 'Fraid I only know this and that about tea, so I'd be little help here...
Uncle Luo: But I do remember that we found him near Mt. Xuanlian. He was still clutching a bottle of water.
Uncle Luo: He said that he had a divine plant in his yard that needed that sort of blessed water to grow. Load of hogwash if you ask me — I mean, it's all just river water. Nothing special about it! Why'd he have to give up his life on account of something like that...
Uncle Luo: *sigh* Still, after we buried him, we poured the water he obtained out in that yard of his. I hope that brought him some solace.
Paimon: The blessed waters of Mt. Xuanlian? We went there and drew some water, too... So, this herb gatherer of yours...
Traveler: I think we're talking about the same person.
Uncle Luo: Well, that's strange happenings, and no mistake... Why don't you come with me? I'll take you to that fellow's yard.
Uncle Luo: If you did draw water, I suppose you can just pour it out in his yard.

## Talk 6

Uncle Luo: If there's nothing else, I'll leave you to look around as much as you'd like.
Paimon: So there really wasn't anyone named Xiangjun...?
Uncle Luo: I'll ask around. Maybe it was just a little mistake somewhere. Y'know, like someone forgetting where they live, and such.
Uncle Luo: In any case, thanks for helping that "adeptus" water the herbs. I'm sure he'll do what he can to defend you from harm as thanks.
