Aramis: How did it get blown up that high...
Traveler: What happened?
Aramis: Oh, it's you, Honorary Knight. How do you do? So it's like this: you must have seen that storm that surrounded the entire city, right?
Aramis: Although the storm has subsided, the effects of that storm aren't going to be fixed any time soon...
Aramis: Not a few merchants have said that the signboards and posters that they put up outside have all gone with the wind.
Aramis: Some have ended up on rooftops, others onto the city walls.
Aramis: The Knights originally intended to send two agile members to settle these issues with haste.
Aramis: I mean, besides helping the citizens, we're also concerned that those things would look rather unbecoming, hanging off the roofs and the walls like that.
Aramis: But as it turns out, we're shorthanded at the moment, so only I was sent.
Aramis: And with these knees of mine, even climbing stairs has become problematic recently. I can't imagine what would become of me if I had to climb up that high...
Aramis: Could you help me out of this bind, Honorary Knight?

Traveler: I'll be happy to.
Aramis: Thank you. I'm so sorry, this should have been my job, but...
Aramis: There should be three posters and one signboard now stuck on rooftops and on the city walls.
Aramis: Please bring those posters to me. As for the signboard, you can just leave it here on the ground. I'll have my colleagues pass it on to the appropriate merchant.
Aramis: Again, thank you. You've really saved me.

Aramis: Hello. Any suspicious activity to report?

Traveler: Are you on patrol?
Aramis: Yes. I'm responsible for security in the vicinity of the Cathedral. I patrol the stairs in front of the Cathedral's entrance.
Aramis: I am proud to have this job because I get to guard the Anemo Archon statue. But I must say, these stairs are taking their toll on my knees...
Aramis: *sigh* I shudder to think whether I'll be able to keep doing this in ten years' time.
