Traveler: Sell?
Tuman: Yeah, don't you know? These huge mushrooms that grow in the rainforest can be sold for quite a good sum in the city.
Tuman: Seems like the Akademiya's always in need of a huge amount of these great mushrooms, so they probably wouldn't mind if a nobody made a little sum off 'em, right?
Tuman: Anyway, my plan to resellâ€” I mean, my plan to sell these mushrooms is perfect! There's just one problem, though. The Withering.
Tuman: Wait, what? The Withering isn't cropping up everywhere anymore? But I've heard that it's still out there in the forest... you aren't trying to trick me, are you!?
Tuman: *sigh* Do you know how strong my desire to sell mushrooms must be in order to land a Vision?
Tuman: The Withering would be a piece of cake if I had one of those.
