# The Recollector's Path


## Talk 1

Zurvan: You look much happier than when last we spoke. Seems things have gone well?
Sorush: Hmm. From what I've learned doing these tasks, I have grown. For now...
Zurvan: You are worthy of being called Bloomguard?
Sorush: No... not yet. There is still a final portion of the task that I need to complete.
Sorush: Until all the tasks are done, until your respect is earned, I am not finished. Only then can the "Twin-Horned Chaplet" truly belong to me.
Zurvan: Oh? Looks like you're actually beyond your rebellious phase after all, just as was claimed.
Sorush: Eâ€”Elder, you... still remember that? Forget, I beg of you!
Zurvan: Haha. Regardless, it's good to see that your spirits have returned.
Zurvan: #{NICKNAME}. Paimon. Please be witnesses to the truth of whether Sorush is worthy of the Twin-Horned Chaplet.
Zurvan: Then I will await you at the end. See you soon.

## Talk 2

Sorush: The Tunigi Hollow... this was the epicenter of the disaster. Though all seems calm...
Traveler: It's not hard to think of how things were then.
Paimon: These crystals are huge... A lot bigger than even Wenut! And to think it's Sorush's responsibility to handle future problems here...
Zurvan: Is this not the most essential duty a Bloomguard should uphold? In addition, Sorush should also expect this of herself.
Paimon: That's what they say, anyway...
Sorush: Do you not trust me? Hmph. I did not realize I was at the stage that even the Pale Floater thinks so little of me.
Paimon: Whoa, Sorush's arrogance makes its grand return!
Traveler: Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
Sorush: Hmph. Why do both of you still harbor such doubt in me after our time together? My pride has never been born of blind arrogance.
Sorush: Hmm. You should be well aware that I fully understand my past mistakes.
Sorush: Before, I placed reputation above action, but now, as I have learned, this is an act of purest neglect.
Sorush: Just as Simurgh became the divine bird through her sacrifice, I will become the Bloomguard by my deeds and hear my name rightfully sung in praise of my service.
Sorush: Additionally, I have completed all the assignments you have given me, Elder. Now, even you must admit that I am one worthy of the title of Bloomguard, worthy of the Twin-Horned Chaplet.
Zurvan: I indeed have no objection to the choice made by the Khvarena.
Sorush: ...Hm?
Zurvan: What? Did you expect me to object?
Sorush: No... I merely... did not expect you to agree so easily, Elder...
Traveler: I expected a few rough words at least?
Zurvan: Ah, I'm not nearly so vicious.
Sorush: About the responsibilities of a Bloomguard... I did not actually gain any knowledge from the Chaplet...
Sorush: Is this because I still do not embody the traits of the Bloomguard fully? Do I still lack training?
Zurvan: For this... The title of Bloomguard might be inherited, but the duties are always variable...
Sorush: I see.
Zurvan: To state it simply: there are no fixed rules, and even more, there are no specific judging standards. Usually, the Khvarena's choice is final.
Sorush: Huh? So, you're saying...
Zurvan: I will not be taking the Twin-Horned Chaplet from you.
Traveler: Now you don't need to worry about the top of your head getting cold.
Paimon: Missing the point!
Sorush: I understand! This must be part of the test!
Paimon: Seems like Sorush is having an epiphany...
Sorush: You are a forgetful one, Pale Floater. I just said it! To pass these tests, besides competence and observation, the most important thing is understanding my past mistakes.
Sorush: Even if the outcome was already determined, would it not be retreading the path of folly if I cast aside all that I have learned during training? So, I think this must be the last test my elder has left me.
Sorush: To a worthy Bloomguard this is but a simple task. This is a sign of your complete trust in me, Elder.
Zurvan: I didn't expect you to see right through me. The Khvarena chose well.
Zurvan: #But your changes... I suppose {NICKNAME} and Paimon bear some credit for that.
Sorush: Indeed! My esteemed Yasnapati and the Pale Floater are both beings of merit.
Sorush: Though I wish to say that I am potent enough alone... I believe that with their aid, the extinguishing of the Sign of Apaosha will be no difficult task.
Zurvan: How very reliable. Don't forget, Mihir and Rashnu will also be able to assist you.
Sorush: Worry not, Elder! Leave everything to me!
Paimon: Paimon keeps thinking that Zurvan might have planned this... But seeing Sorush this happy, Paimon can't really complain.
Traveler: Will not, or can not.
Paimon: Yeah, as Zurvan said herself, the Khvarena's choice is final. That means that Zurvan can't change it either, right?
Zurvan: Oh, ho ho... You really think so?
Paimon: Whoa... That's a little scary...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Sorush: The Tunigi Hollow from before... the epicenter of the disaster of years past...
Paimon: Wow! Paimon didn't think Sorush would really be able to extinguish the Sign of Apaosha and solve all the trouble happening here...
Zurvan: Extinguishing the Sign of Apaosha is but the duty of the Bloomguard. Sorush only did as she should.
Traveler: It was all thanks to Mihir and Rashnu's help.
Paimon: Yeah. And we put in plenty of work too.
Sorush: Splendid! It's so nice of you, my Yasnapati and the Pale Floater, to look beyond the person of greatest importance: me.
Paimon: Whoa, Sorush's arrogance makes its grand return!
Sorush: Hmph. Why do both of you still harbor such doubt in me after our time together? My pride has never been born of blind arrogance.
Sorush: Hmm. You should be well aware that I fully understand my past mistakes.

Sorush: Though I wish to say that I was potent enough alone... I think, truly, that only with their aid could I extinguish the Sign of Apaosha.
Zurvan: I didn't think that, in so short a time, Sorush could become so responsible.
Sorush: Of course! As long as I hold my responsibilities close to heart, then my elder need not worry for my sake.
Paimon: Paimon keeps thinking that Zurvan might have planned this... But seeing Sorush this happy, Paimon can't really complain.
Traveler: Will not, or can not.
Paimon: Yeah, as Zurvan said herself, the Khvarena's choice is final. That means that Zurvan can't change it either, right?
Zurvan: Oh, ho ho... You really think so?
