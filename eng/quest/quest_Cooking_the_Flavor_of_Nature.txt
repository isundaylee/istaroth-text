# Cooking, the Flavor of Nature


## Talk 1

Arachatora: *whimper*
Arachatora: Aah! It's Nara.
Arachatora: *cough* I'm sorry that Nara had to see me in such a messy state.
Arachatora: Kind Nara, I'm Arachatora. You are?
Traveler: #I'm {NICKNAME}.
Paimon: And Paimon's name is Paimon!
Arachatora: #Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon, I see. Thank you so much. If fate hadn't brought us together, it would have taken me much longer to recover.
Paimon: How long is a little longer?
Arachatora: I'm ashamed to admit that something like this happened once before because of bad mushrooms. The Nilotpala Lotuses in the water bloomed and closed, twice, before I recovered.
Paimon: Bloomed and closed... Doesn't that take two days!?
Arachatora: Ah, two days. I see, so that's what a day means. You Nara are really interesting. Are two days long or short?
Paimon: #Hmm... What do you think, {NICKNAME}? Is it long or short?
Traveler: Long, I suppose.
Paimon: Uh-huh, Paimon can't imagine how Arachatora whimpered for two days straight.
Arachatora: Really? So it's a very long time...
Paimon: But if you're Arachatora... Aren't you related to Arapacati?
Arachatora: Nope.
Paimon: Huh? But... You're Arapacati's older brother, right?
Arachatora: Oh, how did you know? Arapacati is my "younger sister."
Paimon: Paimon is confused...
Traveler: Perhaps it's different for Aranara...
Paimon: Anyway, let us bring you up to speed...
Black Screen Text: You bring Arachatora up to speed on the events so far...
Arachatora: Festival Utsava is coming again... What should I do...
Arachatora: I haven't had the most important cooking ingredient yet. Festival Utsava should be the best time to prove the greatness of mushroom dishes to Arasaka, Arapas, and Araphala.
Paimon: So, Aras... spa... ara...
Traveler: Arasaka, Arapas, and Araphala.
Paimon: Ahhh! Aranara names are so difficult! Arachatora, where're your brothers?
Arachatora: We drifted apart on our paths of training, just like a river branches into streams.
Paimon: So you split apart, right?
Arachatora: We train to cook the supreme delicacy, but they refuse to acknowledge mushroom dishes â€” how could they not see that the Head Mushroom is unmatched!
Arachatora: Anyway, we decided to complete our own dishes and compete with each other later.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon totally understands the pursuit of delicious food!
Paimon: So, where's your Head Mushroom?
Arachatora: Marana has been spreading rapidly. Even the Head Mushroom's habitat has been taken over.
Paimon: Ah, the Withering Zone... Paimon hopes Rana is doing okay.
Arachatora: Its withering claws have probably taken the precious mushroom there. I'm sure you're aware how very, very dangerous Marana's territory is.
Arachatora: Without the Head Mushroom, I could only try the strange mushroom that no Aranara has ever tasted before.
Paimon: And?
Traveler: And we witnessed the outcome of it.
Arachatora: How embarrassing...
Paimon: Now that Paimon thinks about it, The Withering... Uh, Marana... We've dealt with it before, right?
Traveler: Barely broke a sweat.
Arachatora: Whoa, unbelievable! You can fight Marana.
Arachatora: #Well, it does make sense. Since Nara {NICKNAME} could heal me with the power of Lesser Lord Kusanali, then removing the effect of Marana shouldn't be a problem.
Arachatora: #So, I want to ask Nara {NICKNAME} to come with me to the Head Mushroom's habitat.
Paimon: #It's our chance to taste an extremely delicious mushroom dish! {NICKNAME}, let's help him, so that these siblings can get back together!
Traveler: We did give Arapacati our word.
Arachatora: Alright, it's in the cave ahead. Please come with me.
Traveler: You're just doing it for the food.
Paimon: We're killing two birds with one stone! What's wrong with that?
Traveler: Barely got out alive.
Traveler: The whimpering.
Traveler: Short, I suppose.
Paimon: Hmm... True. Come to think of it, we've known each other for a long time, but it feels like we met just yesterday.
Arachatora: Really? That's relieving. So losing control for two days in the forest isn't very long.
Paimon: That's not what we meant!
Traveler: It depends on what the time was used for.
Paimon: Well... that's true. Two whole days of whimpering is very long, but two whole days in a forest boar's life is very short.
Arachatora: Really? So it's a very long time...
Traveler: Time is subjective and meaningless.
Arachatora: #Yes, Nara {NICKNAME}, you understand the principles of the forest well. To the forest, life is born, life grows, and life returns to the earth... All these don't need such concept as a "day."
Paimon: You're not making much sense to Paimon...

## Talk 2

Arachatora: Ahh! The Head Mushroom I've always been dreaming about.
Arachatora: Head Mushroom, would you still be the same without your sweet scent?
Paimon: Hehe... This mushroom does smell really good.
Paimon: Anyway, let's get out!

## Talk 3

Arachatora: I'm so lucky to have met both of you.
Arachatora: It's the smell of a fully matured Head Mushroom. It's richer than ever.
Arachatora: So, you grew well even when Marana took over your habitat. You're amazing.
Paimon: Uh, so... Can we taste it?
Arachatora: Of course. Putting aside how you've helped me, serving the most delicious mushroom dish to Nara again has always been the goal of my cooking training.
Paimon: Oh yeah! Head Mushroom!
Black Screen Text: Arachatora immediately starts cooking...
The fresh aroma of the mushroom bursts out from the pot.
Black Screen Text: Once it's ready, Arachatora serves it to you and Paimon.
Should it be considered disappointing? Or conforming to expectations? Because it's tasteless.
Besides that, it's filled with vitality and too tough to the point of being difficult to chew.
Arachatora: ...It's done. My cooking training has finally been completed successfully. What do you think? I'm sure it's the best delicacy to a Nara.
Paimon: *nom nom* *gulp* Uh... how should Paimon put this...
Traveler: *chew forcefully*
Traveler: *swallow forcefully*
Traveler: It's edible. If you try hard enough.
Paimon: Hmm... It's a very fragrant mushroom indeed, but its texture and taste don't really suit us.
Arachatora: Huh?
Arachatora: #How could this be? When I served it to the other Nara from before, {F#he}{M#she} said it was good.
Paimon: From before?
Arachatora: #I served my mushroom dish to a Nara some time ago, and because it was so good, {F#he}{M#she} swallowed it with so much vigor.
Arachatora: It should be fine.
Paimon: ...
Traveler: ...
Arachatora: Oh, just like every Aranara grows different leaves, the taste of the mushroom may not suit all Nara.
Paimon: Right... Speaking of leaves... Are Aranara not afraid of fire? You look like you're covered in leaves...
Arachatora: Of course it's scary. Forest fires sometimes raze entire forests until only barren ground remains.
Arachatora: But it's for my cooking training, so keeping my fear at bay and controlling the temperature of the flames is also a part of my training.
Paimon: So that's how it is... Anyway, guess it's time to go back. Arapacati is waiting for you guys!
Arachatora: Yes, I'll head back to Vanarana immediately. I can't keep my precious sister worrying about me.
Arachatora: As for the others... Arasaka, Arapas, and Araphala are around <color=#00E1FFFF>Gandharva Ville</color>, <color=#00E1FFFF>Apam Woods</color>, and <color=#00E1FFFF>Devantaka Mountain</color>.
Arachatora: #Thank you. Golden Nara {NICKNAME} is dazzling like the sun, and Paimon is quite amazing, too. I'll leave my sister's request to you.
Paimon: Why is Paimon only quite amazing!?
Arachatora: Oh, don't worry about that... Anyway, I don't know how to repay you for all the help you've given me...
Arachatora: Hmm... I've decided to give you my Supreme Delicacy's recipe. Perhaps you'll grow fond of its taste as you age.
Paimon: #({NICKNAME}, if Paimon modifies this recipe a little, it should be able to become a pretty good original dish!)
Traveler: At least it isn't poisonous.
Traveler: It's a little too early for me to have something like this.

## Talk 4

Arachatora: I'm so happy that I was able to gather the Head Mushroom, complete my cooking training, and get to know a strong and reliable Nara.
Arachatora: #Arapacati, Arasaka, Arapas, and Araphala will be grateful too. Nara {NICKNAME}, you're a good Nara.
Traveler: Grateful? Why?
Arachatora: Because by helping me, you've given them a chance to taste the Head Mushroom.

## Talk 5

Head Mushroom: (It does look a little larger than a normal Shroom-Kin. It's best to pick it later once the Withering Zone has been eliminated...)
