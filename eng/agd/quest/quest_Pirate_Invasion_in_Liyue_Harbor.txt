# Pirate Invasion, in Liyue Harbor!


## Talk 1

Little Meng: So. How shall we play it this time?
Little Fei: Hmph. If no one's going to be the pirate, we can't play it at all.
Little Meng: But no one wants to be a pirate. So what're we gonna do...
Traveler: What are you doing?
Little Meng: We were gonna play a game, but there's no one to be the pirate.
Little Meng: If there's no pirate, there's no one to do the robbing... so we can't start the game.
Little Meng: Ooh, ooh, I know, you can do it! Do you want to be a pirate?
Traveler: It will be done.
Little Meng: Yay! Right, let's get ready...
Little Meng: When you're ready, come and join in.
Traveler: Pirating is not my area of expertise...
Little Meng: It's not that hard! A pirate is just someone who is very naughty and takes things that don't belong to them.
Little Meng: I've never met a real pirate though. That's just what Beidou told me.
Little Meng: But I think it must be quite easy to play a pirate.
Little Meng: Hehehe, I'm sure you can do it! Let's go!

## Talk 2

Traveler: Ready!
Little Meng: Then let the game begin!
Little Meng: ...How do we start?
Traveler: Uh... Shiver me timbers? I'm robbing you!
Little Lulu: Eek! Pirates!
Little Fei: Don't worry, Lulu, I'll save you!
Little Meng: You must be a pirate. Tell me, why are you robbing us?
Traveler: Because I'm a pirate...
Little Meng: Not all of them. There are good-guy pirates and bad-guy pirates.
Little Meng: Beidou says she's a pirate, but she's one of the good guys. She gives us snacks! Everyone loves Beidou.
Little Meng: Why you gotta be a bad pirate? Can't you be a good pirate instead?
Paimon: You're the one who said pirates are naughty people who take things that don't belong to them!
Traveler: I see the error of my ways.
Little Meng: Great! Owning up to your mistakes is the first step towards becoming a better person. That's what Beidou says.
Little Meng: The next step is tidying up the area. Because as long as you do good things, you can be a good person. Even a good pirate.
Traveler: I hereby renounce said naughtiness.
Traveler: That's what pirates do...

## Talk 3

Little Meng: Finished cleaning yet?
Traveler: Finished.
Little Meng: Yay! Thanks, these are for you. It was fun playing with you!
Little Meng: And don't forget â€” being a good person doesn't stop here. Make it a habit for life.
Little Fei: Hey, when do I get to be the captain?
Little Meng: Next time.
Little Fei: That's what you said last time...

## Talk 4

Little Meng: Finished cleaning?
Traveler: Not yet.
Little Meng: Hurry up. This is your chance to change your ways and show you can be a good person.
Little Fei: Hey, are we seriously saying that just cleaning up the place once turns you into one of the good guys?
Little Meng: All it takes to be a good person is the willingness to do the right thing.
Little Fei: That sounds too simple...
Little Meng: Do good, you're a good person. Do bad, you're a bad person. Yes, it's very simple.
Little Fei: Huh. You may say so, but then how come there's still so many bad people in the world?
Little Meng: Because everything in the world is easier said than done.
Little Meng: But doing bad things is still easier than doing good things.
Little Fei: Did Beidou teach you that?
Little Meng: Nah, that one I read in a book.
