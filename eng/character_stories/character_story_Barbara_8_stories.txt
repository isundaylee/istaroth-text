## 7. Alice's Idol Magazine

"...Idol?"\nThe first time that Barbara heard this strange word, she was visibly confused.\n"But... aren't The Seven the ones that people are supposed to worship?"\n"Yes, but not exclusively..." replied Alice, an elder of the Hexenzirkel, as she groomed the young girl for stardom. "Read this, it contains everything you will need to know."\n"Idol Magazine" was the name of the assigned reading material. Barbara had no idea what world this magazine had come from, but by reading it she found out that there was indeed such thing as an "idol," and that it mainly involved working hard at getting everyone to like you.\nShe also discovered that an outstanding idol is capable of not just bringing joy to themselves, but also bringing spiritual healing to others through the power of song and dance.\nBarbara set about learning one new song after another, dancing to the beat as she went. Finally, she found happiness, and she found it in the smiling faces of others.\nSome time later, when Alice anxiously relayed to Barbara that plans for "Teyvat Idols!" were falling through, Barbara was starting to make a name for herself through her performances in Mondstadt.\n"Hmm... Well, if I'm the only one left... I guess you can leave it to me to define what it really means to be an idol!"\nDriven by this ever so slightly selfish ambition to spread joy and healing to others, Barbara is slyly swotting up on new tunes behind the scenes to this very day.

## 8. Vision

The story of how Barbara obtained her Vision is hardly the typical tale of high-stakes heroism.\nShe had just joined the church and was looking after a little boy with a high and persisting fever.\nNothing Barbara could think of would console the boy and bring an end to his relentless tears.\nSomeone remarked that while the boy had already taken his medicine, there was no way to cure the pain of missing one's family.\nAnother suggested that Barbara sing a song for the boy to raise his spirits.\nBarbara had never sung a song in her life up until this point, but how could she shy away from it in a moment like this?\n"Never having sung before is no reason to abandon a child in their time of need," Barbara thought to herself.\nAnd so, Barbara took the boy in her arms and sang him a song: a lullaby, the only song she knew.\nIt was an unceremonious beginning to her singing career. After quickly realizing that she barely knew any of the words, she had to resort to humming the tune instead.\nNevertheless, her voice began to soothe the child, and so she kept singing. She sang the same song, over and over again, until her throat was dry and her voice was hoarse. Finally, the boy fell asleep. Exhausted, Barbara lay down by the wall and fell straight asleep herself.\nEarly the next morning, Barbara awoke to discover that the boy's fever had come down. Perhaps it was because she had sung for him, or perhaps it had something to do with the Vision which had mysteriously appeared next to her hand at some point during the night.\nBarbara was not preoccupied with the Vision, however. It was the sight of the boy smiling once again that filled her heart with joy.\nBarbara received her Vision for the simple but beautiful wish that took hold in her heart that night: A dream of healing the sick through the power of song.
