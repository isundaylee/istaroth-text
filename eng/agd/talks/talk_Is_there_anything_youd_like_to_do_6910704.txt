# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Citlali: Huh, doing nothing at all sounds pretty nice.
Traveler: You've got a point.
Citlali: Most people live no longer than a hundred years, so there's no point losing sleep over issues that will take thousands of years to solve.
Citlali: But, live long enough, and you learn that only a handful of things in life truly matter.
Citlali: You can dedicate one tenth of your time to the important things, but when it comes to the remaining nine tenths, it's just a matter of finding ways to pass the time.
Citlali: But, that's just a general rule, okay? Not a comment on my age!
Traveler: Huh, I don't feel like I have that much down time.
Citlali: Hm, I guess you're right. Maybe my life is just less interesting.
Citlali: It's just like the detectives from those Fontaine crime novels â€” always embroiled in intrigue wherever they go.
Citlali: I suppose there are people like that in real life, too.
Traveler: In real life, we call those people, "unlucky."
Citlali: Actually, crime novels only chronicle a small part of a detective's life.
Citlali: Realistically, the cases only last a few days.
Citlali: So, who knows? Maybe they're just killing time in between important events like the rest of us.
Traveler: Or maybe the rest of their time is spent trying to recover from mental trauma...
Citlali: Well, when you put it that way... Choosing to do nothing is how I recover from the trauma in my life.
Citlali: ...
Citlali: Okay, I'm begging you... Don't give me that look. I can hear what you're thinking.
Citlali: "Citlali's nihilism strikes again."
Citlali: But, I'm fine! At my age, I don't need people fretting over me... Not that I'm THAT old, of course...
Citlali: Anyway, it doesn't matter... C'mon, let's go for a walk. We should grab something to eat, too. It's been a while.
Citlali: Well? What are you waiting for? Let's get a move on!
