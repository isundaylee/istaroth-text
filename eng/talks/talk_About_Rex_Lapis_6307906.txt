Traveler: About Rex Lapis...
Qiuyue: Do you mean the passing of Rex Lapis? I've already heard about that.
Qiuyue: When that incident took place, the lockdown of Inazuma had already happened, so I also missed the Rite of Parting.
Qiuyue: *sigh* I'm still a bit broken up about it. I'm sure every Liyue citizen would've grieved too...
