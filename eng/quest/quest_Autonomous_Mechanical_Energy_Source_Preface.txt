# Autonomous Mechanical Energy Source: Preface

Hosseini: You're just in time. The calibration work on Pursina's Spikes is going quite smoothly indeed.
Hosseini: As long as we can secure the components we need, they can be repaired in no time at all.
Traveler: I did gather some.
Hosseini: Thank you, that's a big help.
Hosseini: Now that we have these, this won't take long.
Hosseini: There is still one small matter that I thought it best to discuss with you.
Hosseini: When you were collecting components these past few days, I scrutinized the inner workings of the Pursina's Spikes we have on hand.
Hosseini: They are very intricate tools, as I suppose I should have expected from one so skilled as Pursina.
Hosseini: Even a small adjustment can greatly affect the function of the entire machine, so I was somewhat worried if our calibrations would achieve their intended effect.
Hosseini: For safety reasons, I hope to ask you to give it a few trial runs. I will then make further calibrations based off the data you collect in these trials.
Hosseini: This way, we can ensure that our Spikes are functioning at peak efficiency. Otherwise, things might get dicey if they malfunction when you engage that anomalous model.
Traveler: Very conscientious of you.
Hosseini: Well, this is my first time working with Pursina's Spikes, so it's best to err on the side of caution.
Hosseini: Well, I leave the tests in your capable hands, Traveler.
Traveler: I understand.
