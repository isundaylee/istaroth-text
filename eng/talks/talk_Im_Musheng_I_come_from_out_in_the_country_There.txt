Musheng: I'm Musheng, I come from out in the country. There's definitely more of a festive atmosphere in the city.
Musheng: The heroes that we remember during Lantern Rite are actually adepti who lived in Liyue in the distant past.
Musheng: That was a time when the adepti lived among the normal people. I don't know why we never see any adepti nowadays...
Musheng: I can't help but think it's a bad omen... Ah, what am I saying? I shouldn't jinx the festival, should I? Haha.
