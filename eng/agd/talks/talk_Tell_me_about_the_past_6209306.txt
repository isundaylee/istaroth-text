Traveler: Tell me about the past.
Madame Ping: Just because my complexion screams "ancient history" doesn't mean I love discussing the past, you know.
Madame Ping: ...Relax, I'm only kidding.
Madame Ping: Truth be told, the older you get, the more time you have on your hands, and the more you start contemplating the past... I do wonder how my old friends back in the mountains are getting on...
Madame Ping: Liyue Harbor is really a wonderful place now. I wonder if they would ever want to step down into the mortal realm and get a taste of the lifestyle here...
Madame Ping: Look at me rambling on again, I must sound like a lunatic! Maybe one day I can discuss my past with you... if it is meant to be.
