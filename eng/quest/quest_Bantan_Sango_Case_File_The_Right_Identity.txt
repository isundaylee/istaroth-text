# Bantan Sango Case File: The Right Identity


## Talk 1

Sango: That seems to be the only possibility...
Sango: Hmm... I need to find a few more clues...
Traveler: How's the case been going?
Sango: Oh-ho, Traveler. You're just in time. We've hit a critical point in our case.
Sango: Thanks to Amano and Andou's actions, our culprit seems convinced that the Doushin's investigation is directed towards the Treasure Hoarders.
Sango: So the culprit is still committing crimes in the city from time to time, leaving a lot of tracks behind.
Sango: The culprit committed another crime yesterday. This time, the victim was Mr. Kanbei, the owner of Shimura's.
Sango: After discovering that the money had been stolen from the store, Mr. Kanbei was beside himself with rage — spent some time just yelling angrily outside, so I hear.
Sango: A few years ago, he might have gathered some help and gone to town to search for the thief in person.
Ryuuji: It is a bold move indeed on the culprit's part to steal money from Mr. Kanbei...
Sango: The timing was quite clever too.
Sango: He noticed that Mr. Kanbei would close his store every few days so he could have a drink.
Sango: So after Mr. Kanbei got drunk, they took the money in the store and strolled out leisurely.
Sango: Kanbei has been coming over for several days to ask me to find the culprit. Honestly, I'm getting sick of that loud voice of his.
Sango: As such, I'd like to ask you and Ryuuji to go check out how he's doing and listen to, well, his complaints.
Sango: After that, go ask around if anyone saw or heard anything while the theft was ongoing at Shimura's.
Sango: Come back and tell me when you're done. I'll be here waiting for you.

## Talk 2

Yayoi Nanatsuki: Hi, what can I do for you?
Traveler: I want to ask about the burglary at Shimura's...
Yayoi Nanatsuki: Well, I sure did hear about it. It was hard not to hear Mr. Kanbei's angry voice...
Yayoi Nanatsuki: Wait. Are you asking if I saw anything?
Yayoi Nanatsuki: Sorry, I didn't... In fact, I didn't know about it until I was woken up by the sound of Mr. Kanbei's roaring...
Traveler: Were there any suspicious people around?
Yayoi Nanatsuki: Suspicious people? Well... I didn't see anyone suspicious.
Yayoi Nanatsuki: *sigh* I guess everyone around was woken up because of Mr. Kanbei's loud voice...

## Talk 3

Shimura Kanbei: Darn in... Who on earth would have done this...
Traveler: Are you Shimura Kanbei?
Shimura Kanbei: Ah, yes, I am, and you are... Oh! If it isn't Ryuuji!
Shimura Kanbei: Has Ms. Sango found out who that monster is? Why, I'm going to whoop that...
Ryuuji: She has not found the culprit yet.
Traveler: So, about the theft...
Shimura Kanbei: I've told Ms. Sango everything that I know. I drank too much and fell asleep straight away.
Shimura Kanbei: When I woke up, all the money in the store was gone!
Shimura Kanbei: Curses... Who would do such a thing...

## Talk 4

Furuya Noboru: Hmm? Is something the matter?
Traveler: About the theft in Shimura's...
Furuya Noboru: That? I heard about it.
Furuya Noboru: If you're looking for a witness, I'm sorry, I don't have any information of value.
Furuya Noboru: I was busy working at the Adventurers' Guild at the time. I didn't go outside.
Furuya Noboru: It was only after I heard Mr. Kanbei's shout that I went out to have a look. That's when I heard about the theft.
Traveler: Was there anyone around who seemed suspicious?
Furuya Noboru: Suspicious?
Furuya Noboru: Hmm... I'm sorry. I'm afraid wasn't paying close attention to that.
Furuya Noboru: You should probably ask someone else.

## Talk 5

Sango: You're back. How was it? Did you find anything out?
Sango: Well... I see... Thank you. You did a great job.
Sango: This culprit really knows how to pick his targets. Aside from Mr. Kanbei, the owner of Netsuke no Gen Crafts, Mikoshi Genichirou, was also a victim.
Sango: When he left the store to visit his friends, the thief stole a lot of valuable things from within.
Sango: Ah, right. Miss Yayoi's lacquerware store was also hit. When she went out on a delivery run, a lot of valuable lacquerware was stolen from the store.
Traveler: The thief sure seems familiar with their routines...
Sango: That's right. But as you can see, there aren't many merchants or residents on this street. If a local committed the crime, someone would figure it out.
Sango: But if it wasn't a local, how could the culprit be so precise about when the victims would leave their stores?
Sango: I also thought about that. After Amano and Andou checked the whereabouts of the surrounding households and businesses, the possibility of a local committing the crime has been ruled out.
Sango: The locations of the crime were scattered. It seems like they were done on a whim by Treasure Hoarders roaming into the city...
Sango: But the methods used are so precise. It doesn't look like the Treasure Hoarders did it at all.
Sango: I believe that... perhaps the thief personally scouted out and collected information about the lives of people around the city to make their plans...
Sango: As I said, there aren't many residents here and they all know each other. If there were any strangers, everyone would have noticed.
Traveler: So this is a dead end!
Sango: So, if the thief could do this, then... he has to have a "suitable persona."
Sango: It must have been someone who could reasonably show up anywhere at any time without drawing any suspicion.
Traveler: Is there really anyone like that?
Sango: Of course. In fact, you may have met them already.
Sango: They are...
Sango: People who have experienced a drastic change in personality due to the loss of their Vision.
Traveler: How can that be?
Sango: Someone who has gone through a drastic personality change due to the loss of Vision. Someone who is drowsy all day, who doesn't know where they were from, and who don't talk to anyone.
Sango: Perhaps, to be more convincing and gain sympathy, they might mumble some nonsense to themselves...
Sango: They might even drink alcohol while staring blankly at the roadside...
Sango: Faced with a stranger who has lost their Vision, people would normally feel sympathetic rather than suspicious, right?
Sango: So, if this stranger was also telling stories about their past... maybe people would be moved to give them Mora. That's how they got the capital to start up this criminal operation.
Traveler: ...To think that someone might use something like that as a cover.
Sango: Calm down. To a criminal, society is just a toy to be used to get what they desire.
Sango: Thank you for your help. It should only take us a few more steps to find this fellow.
Sango: Once I get enough evidence, I'll need your skills again. Until then, go get some rest.
Sango: Here's your remuneration, by the way.
Traveler: It's inexcusable...
Traveler: This makes no sense.
Traveler: How was the thief so precise in their timing?

Sango: After discovering that the Mora had been stolen from the store, Mr. Kanbei was beside himself with rage — spent some time just yelling angrily outside, so I hear.
Sango: A few years ago, he might have simply grabbed his sword and gone out to nab the culprit himself.
Ryuuji: It is a bold move indeed on the culprit's part to steal Mora from Mr. Kanbei...

Yayoi Nanatsuki: Suspicious people? Well... I didn't see anyone suspicious.
Yayoi Nanatsuki: Not to mention how the atmosphere in the city is really tense right now. If there was anyone suspicious, they would probably have been taken away by the Doushin for questioning by now...

Furuya Noboru: I was busy working at the Adventurers' Guild at the time when the theft occurred.
Furuya Noboru: If you need proof that I was on Guild premises at the time, you can ask Katheryne.
Traveler: Have you seen anyone around who seems suspicious?
Furuya Noboru: Suspicious?
Furuya Noboru: To be honest, it's a bit hard for me to tell.
Furuya Noboru: If you take the Vision Hunt Decree into account... there's just far too many people whose actions might be interpreted as "suspicious."

### Additional Talk 13

Furuya Noboru: But if you need proof that I was on Guild premises at the time, you can ask Katheryne.

Sango: Our culprit also somehow knew that Genichirou is in the habit of visiting a friend every so often, and committed the theft of quite a few valuable items while he was away.

Sango: Faced with someone who has lost their Vision, even a stranger from another nation would normally feel sympathetic rather than suspicious, right?
Sango: So, if this stranger was also telling stories about their past... maybe people would be moved to give them Mora. That's how they got the capital to start up this criminal operation.
Traveler: The Vision Hunt Decree has been abolished, though.
Sango: Well, yes... And I imagine that this fellow isn't sure what their next move should be, either.
Sango: Thank you for your help. It should only take us a few more steps to find our culprit.
Sango: Once I get enough evidence, I'll need your skills again. Until then, go get some rest.
