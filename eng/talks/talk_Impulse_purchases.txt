Traveler: Impulse purchases?
Wei Xiaobao: Ugh, exactly!
Wei Xiaobao: Seeing as this was my first overseas trip, I let down my guard and went on a buying spree.
Wei Xiaobao: Never mind anything else... What would I do with several dozen bottles of perfume, anyway? I couldn't even give that many away fast enough!
Wei Xiaobao: ...But I suppose I can just take it as if I bought a large batch of samples!
Wei Xiaobao: I mean, I've still got a long vacation ahead of me. Maybe I could open up new markets by bringing these to other places.
