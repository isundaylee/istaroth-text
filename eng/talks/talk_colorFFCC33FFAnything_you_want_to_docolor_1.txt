Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Anything you want to do?</color>
Yoimiya: I want to know more about youuuu!
Yoimiya: I've heard people everywhere tell tales of your heroics, and I've seen it first-hand adventuring with you.
Yoimiya: But the more I learn, the more curious I become â€” what makes you so special?
Yoimiya: There is always a reason for everything. For example, I like to talk because when I was a kid, Pops really seemed to enjoy listening to me.
Yoimiya: I like fireworks because creating incredible fireworks makes me feel so proud of my work.
Yoimiya: So what's there for you?
Traveler: There is someone I want to see.
Yoimiya: So that's what drives you.
Yoimiya: And you don't want your reunion to be a disappointing one, do you?
Yoimiya: Wow, I'm really impressed. Honestly, I envy you!
Yoimiya: I'll help you. No matter where it is, you must be reunited!
Yoimiya: Hehe, sorry, I'm getting too excited.
Yoimiya: But I've decided, I want to retrace your path!
Yoimiya: Starting from Mondstadt, to Liyue, and then to Inazuma... I will go see the sights you've seen and meet the people you've come across.
Yoimiya: That's what one has to do if they want to get to know someone completely!
Traveler: Isn't that a bit much?
Yoimiya: Sorry, I don't mean to put any pressure on you. I was just, well... how should I put it? Simply, I...
Yoimiya: I want to know more about youuuu!
Traveler: There are people I want to help.
Yoimiya: So that's what motivates you.
Yoimiya: You don't want to see anyone suffer.
Yoimiya: You are like a storybook hero, so awesome.
Yoimiya: Hmm, that means I'm friends with a hero, doesn't it?
Yoimiya: I'll support you with all I've got, so go ahead and write the rest of your story!
