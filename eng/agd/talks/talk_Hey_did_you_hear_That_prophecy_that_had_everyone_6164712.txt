Mikhail: Hey, did you hear? That prophecy that had everyone in Fontaine worried came true!
Lyudmila: Wait, so does that mean something terrible happened?
Mikhail: Well, for Fontainians, there's good news and there's bad news.
Mikhail: The good news is that nobody dissolved in the water. The bad news is that there was still a huge flood.
Lyudmila: I see... So, did Lady Arlecchino...
Mikhail: Nothing to worry about! The Knave came out on top, didn't take a single loss!
Mikhail: In fact, she even obtained the Hydro Archon's Gnosis for the Tsaritsa because she helped the Court of Fontaine!
Lyudmila: For real? But I heard that Master Childe was badly hurt during the flood...
Mikhail: Master Childe? There's even less of a need to worry about him.
Mikhail: He's famous for his combat abilities. I'm sure he'll be up and about soon!
