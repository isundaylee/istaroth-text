Traveler: True gourmet cuisine?
Chan Baatjan: It seems you are a fellow seeker and lover of the finest cuisine and daintiest of delicacies as well.
Chan Baatjan: I am Chan Baatjan. I won't claim to be the best chef in Yilong Wharf, but I have never disrespected the original flavors of my ingredients and always cooked every dish with great care.
Chan Baatjan: Unfortunately, I do not often cook anymore, but these days am more akin to a very picky wandering gourmand.
Chan Baatjan: Someone who's just busy in the kitchen all day has quite limited influence in the end.
Chan Baatjan: Thus, over the past few years, I've taken in a dozen or so students and taught them everything I know.
Chan Baatjan: Now, some of them have graduated. The owner of Lianfang Dim Sum and the head chef for Jiulue Teahouse were both my prized pupils.
Chan Baatjan: You should try out their creations. May you find the offerings to your taste!
