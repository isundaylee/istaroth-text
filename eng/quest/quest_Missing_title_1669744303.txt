# Missing title (1669744303)


## Talk 1

Ku: Ouch...
Ruu: #Traveler! Paimon! You're just in time...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Ku: Ow, ow, ow, think I sprained my ankle...
Ruu: Big Brother Ku's hurt again. Could you please help us make offerings at the Perch?
Traveler: You know, I have to admit that I expected this development...
Paimon: Don't you worry about a thing! We've got this!
Ruu: Thanks so much!
Paimon: Ooh, right! Aren't you very sensitive to the elements and all, Ruu?
Paimon: Why don't you do that yourself?
Ruu: Uh... So, I did try before in previous ceremonies, but it didn't turn out so well.
Traveler: Why did that happen?
Ruu: I... don't know...
Paimon: Ah well. Guess we're handling this perch business.
Traveler: Then I'll do it in your stead.
Traveler: We'll leave the injured person to you.
Traveler: Leave it to me.

## Talk 2

Ku: Ugh, what an embarrassment... I just hope this won't affect the ceremony.
Ku: I wouldn't know how to face you if it does, Ruu.
Ruu: Oh, don't be like that! You've always been so nice to me!

## Talk 3

Ruu: Please help us with the Perch!
Ruu: I'll stay here with Big Brother Ku.

## Talk 4

Ruu: Ooh, the Perch is all lit up now!
Ku: Guess that's that done. Sorry, I imagine that it was pretty rough.
Paimon: Hehe! We're specialist problem solvers, don'cha know?
Traveler: It's not that different from the Light Actuating Ceremony.
Paimon: Going to three spots to fix three smaller problems to solve a larger issue...
Paimon: It feels like we've had this happen to us a lot, huh?
Ruu: I don't really understand a lot of what you said, but the adults do have this saying...
Ruu: They call it "The Rule of Three."
Paimon: What's that supposed to mean?
Ruu: Well, I guess they just mean that you need to do things thrice in order to get a result.
Ruu: For example, they say that "good omens must occur three times for good fortune to truly descend"... Same for bad omens.
Ruu: They also say that "you must forge past obstacles three times to succeed on the fourth."
Paimon: But isn't that more like the "Rule of Four," then?
Ruu: Huh, that's true! You're really good at numbers, Paimon!
Paimon: Hehe, of course!
Traveler: How is that the point?
Paimon: Anyway, are you sure Ku will be fine?
Ruu: Don't worry, he's always like this.
Ku: Ugh, what an embarrassment... I just hope this won't affect the ceremony.
Ku: I wouldn't know how to face you if it does, Ruu.
Ruu: Oh, don't be like that! You've always been so nice to me!
Ku: ...
Ruu: #Traveler, Paimon, you two go ahead first!
Ruu: I'll stay here with Big Brother Ku. We'll take charge of the cleanup work once you're done with the offering!
Traveler: How's Ku's injury, by the way?
