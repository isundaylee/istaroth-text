Traveler: About Kurisu...
Xixi: President Kurisu is very reliable! Every outlander on Ritou can count on him.
Xixi: He's been living in Inazuma for a long time, after all. He has all sorts of secret resources...
Xixi: Oh no, I'm talking too much! Um, you didn't hear that...
Xixi: Well... Anyway, even if you aren't a merchant, you can still ask Kurisu for help. As outlanders, we all have to look after each other here... That's what he always tells us.
Xixi: For a fellow outlander like yourself, I believe the President will definitely welcome you with open arms if you ever find yourself in trouble. Yeah.
