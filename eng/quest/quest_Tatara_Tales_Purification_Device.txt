# Tatara Tales: Purification Device


## Talk 1

Xavier: It'll take a while longer...
Traveler: Have you gathered all the necessary data?
Xavier: Ah, it's you! Wonderful. We haven't quite collected all the data we need yet. I believe it will take a little more time.
Xavier: That said, I've taken this opportunity to think about the structure of the emergency purifier...
Traveler: What's that?
Xavier: Just a last-minute trick I've pulled.
Xavier: According to our previous discussions, we must deal with a two-pronged problem: the Fatui and the Tatarigami within.
Xavier: I trust you will be able to deal with the Fatui. My part in this, therefore, is to deal with the Tatarigami energy.
Xavier: This emergency purifier is a device that I have had purpose-built for that task. However, I'm going to need your help to complete it.
Traveler: In what way?
Xavier: We will need some special materials to ensure this device functions smoothly within the Mikage Furnace.
Xavier: Crystal Marrow, which contains an inert form of Tatarigami energy, is an ideal candidate for this task.
Xavier: In truth, the secret of the famed Jade Steel is that a special method is used to add this very material during the forging process to increase the strength of the metal.
Xavier: Of course, the special method in question is a trade secret.
Xavier: If memory serves, this crystalline ore can be found nearby. Please help me obtain three chunks.
Traveler: I've got it.
Xavier: Well then, you have my thanks. Remember, it's 3 chunks of Crystal Marrow — bring them back once you've got them.
Traveler: And here I thought you'd have a more official name...
Xavier: Why, that is its official name — the "emergency purifier"!
Xavier: Unless... Are you speaking of its official product number, date of manufacture?
Xavier: Well, since this is a purely emergency device, we don't need such things.
Traveler: Is this an "emergency measure," too?
Xavier: I suppose, although I would hesitate to provide this sort of aid during normal customer service...

## Talk 2

Xavier: Do you have those 3 Crystal Marrow chunks for me?

## Talk 3

Xavier: Have you got your hands on 3 Crystal Marrow chunks yet?

## Talk 4

Xavier: Thank you, truly! These shall form the basic structure of our device.
Xavier: Now, all we need to do is wait for our beacons to collect enough data.
Xavier: Once we have that data on hand, I will make a few tweaks to this device accordingly.
Xavier: Once all is ready, let us put a decisive end to this incident.
