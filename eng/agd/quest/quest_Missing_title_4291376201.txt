Bulletin Board (Message): "Uh, wow, that's kinda formal... How am I supposed to reply?"
Bulletin Board (Another Person's Message): "Eh, you can just take that to be the Narukami way. All roundabout and longwinded-like, not like us Watatsumi folk!"

Bulletin Board (Message): "Thank you, Lady Miko, for your painstaking efforts, but I fear that some of our hurts may never be healed."
Bulletin Board (Reply): It is "companionship" that gives "eternity" meaning. The past may have been cruel, but the future shall be longer still.

Bulletin Board (Message): "They say that the insanely talented author from Liyue, Zhenyu, is also a chivalrous hero."
Bulletin Board (Message): "Ever since I read one of his books, I've always wondered what sort of person he might be."
Bulletin Board (Another Person's Message): "Don't think about it too much. Maybe he's just like most authors from Inazuma. You know the type: some sickly, thin, glasses-wearing middle-aged man."
Bulletin Board (Someone Else's Message): "He could also be some rotund scholar who speaks weirdly and stuff, you know..."
Bulletin Board (A Third Person's Message): "You know what I think? I think he's got to be some mountain of martial muscle! A powerful body and a sharp mind, all rolled into one!"
Bulletin Board (Yet Another Person's Message): "You're all wrong! I mean, just look at that lovely handwriting! It's gotta be a beautiful young woman, one who knows her way around books and scholarly tomes of all kinds!"
Bulletin Board (Reply): Please control yourselves! This is a public notice board, not someplace to endlessly jabber about personal matters!

## Talk 11

Bulletin Board (Message): "The Kamisato siblings of the Yashiro Commission have been in higher spirits lately."

Bulletin Board (Another Person's Message): "Ah, are you feeling a little sour about our Commissioner's rise, my friend?"

## Talk 12

Bulletin Board (Message): "We fought to the death against the folks from Sangonomiya, and now we need to rebuild an island together with them..."
Bulletin Board (Message): "I mean, I know that it's an arrangement that comes down from the top and that everyone acknowledges that this is the right thing to do, but it just leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, you know?"
Bulletin Board (Reply): The time for peace has come, so don't think about it too much. Our cooperation now is also meant to build a better nation for future generations.
