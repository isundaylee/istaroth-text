Lupical means wolf home— no, Lupical means wolf family. My Lupical lives in the woods. They say I am their Lupical.

## More About Razor: IV
My Lupical is my only family. But I don't have four legs, not like them. Because I'm not a real wolf. Sometimes, this makes me sad.

## More About Razor: V
When I run with you, when I hunt with you, I am happy. With you, I am not a wolf, I am not a boy, I am just me. I am Razor. Because you are my friend. You are my Lupical. I hope you feel happy, too!
