(Quest is part of chapter: A Free Lunch)

# A Free Lunch


## Talk 1

Strange Person: #Excuse me, young lad over there, yes, yes, you! You there, come, come on over!
Paimon: Huh? Are you talking to us?
Strange Person: Oh, my friends, I immediately saw you are new here. You must not yet be very familiar with the Fortress of Meropide, then?
Strange Person: Congratulations on running into me today! I am the single nicest resident of the entire Fortress.
Strange Person: Today, allow me to help you familiarize yourself with the Fortress. Of course, it will all be "free."
Traveler: Actually, I already know the place quite well.
Strange Person: Oh, don't say that!
Strange Person: Perhaps you think you've got your bearings, but under my guidance, I believe you'll discover all kinds of things you never noticed.
Traveler: There's such a thing as a free lunch?
Strange Person: Of course, of course! Like I said, I'm the kindest resident of the entire Fortress.
Paimon: Huh, this guy's kind of weird. We've only just met and he's all buddy-buddy!
Strange Person: Haha, my friend, think nothing of it! How about this, you two discuss it amongst yourselves first, and I'll wait over here to hear your decision.
Strange Person: Once you've made up your minds, come find me.

## Talk 2

Strange Person: How about it? Have you come to a consensus?
Paimon: You said it yourself, it must be absolutely free!
Strange Person: Of course, of course, it will be totally "free."
Strange Person: Come come come, now I will show you about the Fortress of Meropide!

## Talk 3

Strange Person: This is the Coupon Cafeteria, and each person may claim one free Welfare Meal here each day.
Strange Person: The only problem is that what you get to eat is completely up to fate.
Paimon: Hmm, is that all? This is just stuff anyone learns on their first day!
Strange Person: Calm down, calm down, I have some secret information as well. They say there is a secret codeword you can say to Bran when claiming your Welfare Meal, which will allow you to obtain the legendary mystery meal!
Paimon: Ah, really? What codeword?
Strange Person: Unfortunately, I do not know. Regarding the codeword, I await the day you discover it for yourselves.
Paimon: That's totally Paimon's line!
Strange Person: Do not worry about such trivial details! Our next stop, the Tri-Coupon Troupe!

## Talk 4

Strange Person: This is the location of the Tri-Coupon Troupe.
Paimon: Huh? Is that the entire intro?
Strange Person: Didn't you manage to associate that with anything? Where there is a troupe, there is drama! Where there is drama, there is romance! Where there is romance, there is love!
Strange Person: They say that as long as you come here and watch their performances every day, you will find your true love.
Paimon: Are there really rumors like that? Then shouldn't everyone be gathered here every day?
Strange Person: That is so, but for it to come true, you cannot be a prisoner or a guard of the Fortress of Meropide.
Paimon: So nobody can ever meet their true love!
Strange Person: Perhaps that is the crux of the problem. Regardless, let us head to our next destination first.

## Talk 5

Strange Person: This is... the lift to the production zone.
Paimon: This place doesn't have strange rumors too, does it?
Strange Person: No, that is does not. It's just that I really hate this place.
Paimon: Oh? Why's that?
Strange Person: Because...
Paimon: Because...?
Strange Person: Because I don't wanna work!
Strange Person: I'm only here because I didn't wanna work, so I stole a loaf of bread to feed myself because I was so hungry, and was sentenced as a result.
Strange Person: So why, why do you still have to work in the Fortress of Meropide!?
Strange Person: "Any little bit of work will knock me out!" That's my life's motto.
Paimon: Gah! It feels like he's getting all weird just being here, let's get out of here and go to the next place.

## Talk 6

Strange Person: Okay, friends! We're finally at my favorite facility: The Pankration Ring! This place is our paradise!
Paimon: This place... Is it really that great? That feels way different from what Paimon's heard...
Strange Person: Of course, but don't listen to those outside rumors. That's just an image intended to fool others. Come, come, come, I have a consent form over here, if you just sign it...
Guard: Hey! It's you again! Tricking people into signing consent forms to register for the competition again, are we? You won't escape this time!
Guard: You two are quite lucky that I noticed just before you were going to sign those forms!
Guard: In any case, ignore this fraud. He and the organization behind him specialize in tricking unsuspecting people into dangerous competitions, and they earn a profit from it.
Strange Person: Don't make up things like that! I haven't tricked anyone! They're all my friends, and they're just signing up willingly after I recommending it to them as a friend!
Guard: Right, I'm sure. I know a better place for you to spout your nonsense. With me, now!
Black Screen Text: The strange person was escorted away by the guard...
Paimon: Phew... There's no such thing as a free lunch after all!
