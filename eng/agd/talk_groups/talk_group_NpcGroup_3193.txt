Traveler: About Byakuyakoku...
Tsuyuko: Enkanomiya's name was Byakuyakoku once upon a time. There was neither sun nor moon in that underground realm, and the only two astronomical phenomena being the Whitenight and the Evernight.
Tsuyuko: One of my ancestors was a shrine maiden named Eboshi. She was a character of some significance in Byakuyakoku's history, and it is due to her that I am in charge of the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri.

Traveler: How have things been?
Tsuyuko: How have what things been... Oh, you mean my work here?
Tsuyuko: Well, we've been dealing with various issues for people whose livelihoods have been affected by the war... I doubt you'd be enthused to hear about such dry stuff.
Tsuyuko: Nonetheless, I'm doing pretty alright. Thanks for your concern.

Traveler: So, about that whole Enkanomiya business...
Tsuyuko: Her Excellency the Divine Priestess has yet to authorize our request to open Enkanomiya. We'll just have to wait for her to make the call.
Tsuyuko: In any case, our primary task right now is the restoration of the peoples' lives... More long term plans will have to wait for a while.
Tsuyuko: Still, I can't say I'm not excited to find out what our ancestral lands deep beneath the ocean waves looks like.
Tsuyuko: In any case, the conclusion of this matter was thanks to your help as well. Allow me to express our gratitude once again.
