Traveler: What is this place?
Marette: This is where new prisoners are registered... One of them, anyway.
Marette: I don't think I was notified that any new prisoners would be coming... If you've come to the wrong place, please go back the way you came or ask one of the nearby guards for assistance.

Traveler: Hello.
Marette: Oh, it's you. I remember you, and your little friend as well. You're the ones the Iudex personally had escorted over here. You don't see that every day.
Marette: Okay... Your registration information is all squared away. Try not to make any waves until you complete your sentence, okay?
