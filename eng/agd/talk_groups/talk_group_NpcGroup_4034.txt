Shahbandar: Halva, did you lower tax rates for the merchants again?
Shahbandar: I told you, don't be afraid to disagree with them. You have to be patient with them, and use the old carrot-and-stick approach...
Halva: Uh, with all due respect, I don't think that's the problem...
Halva: The majority of the taxes and fees we collect end up as funding for the researchers, but the Akademiya is hardly strapped for cash.
Halva: But putting undue pressure on the merchants isn't conducive to the normal flow of business. So, it doesn't hurt to be more lenient with them...
Shahbandar: Don't be naïve! I'll remind you that your job is to collect taxes and fees, not to promote business.
Shahbandar: There are other ways of regulating such business matters. It's nothing we of the Navbed need to concern ourselves with.
Shahbandar: You're still an intern, so all you need to do is the job you've been tasked with. Understood?
Halva: Y—Yes...

Traveler: Picking out some jewels?
Halva: Ah, no. I'm just admiring them is all.
Halva: I may not be able to afford anything like this as a trainee tax officer, but just being able to look at such shiny and beautiful things brings me joy.
Halva: *sigh* It's hard not to doubt yourself when your superior is always scolding you for being childish...
Halva: So, when I'm not working, I look at the things I like to blow off steam.
