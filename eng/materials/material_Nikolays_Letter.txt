# Nikolay's Letter

A letter you found off one of the Black Serpent Knights. The name of the letter's recipient is neatly written: "Katarina Snezhevna, My Dear Elder Sister," while the sender's name is written somewhat haphazardly, though you can make out the words "Your Brother, Nikolay Snezhevich."
