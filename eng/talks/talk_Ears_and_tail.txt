Traveler: Ears and tail?
Kano Nana: Yeah, I'm looking for this girl who has the ears and tail of a badger.
Kano Nana: But the ears and tail don't actually grow from her body â€” they're just part of her outfit.
Kano Nana: Her name is Sayu. She is a little ninja from the Kamisato Clan of the Yashiro Commission. She always disappears to slack off if she gets a chance.
Kano Nana: Some say that the big tail on her outfit has lots of ninjutsu items hidden inside, which can help her hide... Alas, that's a big headache for anyone who is in charge of looking for her, like me.
