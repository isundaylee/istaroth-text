Traveler: Why not take a vacation?
Maupoil: But I haven't finished my work yet... I know that everything in the Fortress will keep running without me. But I can't stop worrying...
Maupoil: I need to see everything resolved with my own eyes, and ideally solve each problem personally! It's the only way I can get a good night's sleep.
