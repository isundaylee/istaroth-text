Traveler: About flowers...
Aragaru: #Festival Utsava was a very happy time, and Nara Traveler also received many flowers.
Aragaru: I am very curious. Why did Golden Nara receive everyone's flowers like the flowers are raindrops converging into river?
Aragaru: I see, so I had given flowers long ago in the story.
