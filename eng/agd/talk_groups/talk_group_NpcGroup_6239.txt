Utsil: Everything's fine. If I had to complain about anything, it's that no one's got time to play cards with me... But now that I think about it, I'm at work right now myself.

Utsil: Thanks to the Qucusaurs' protection, everything's going great! The Riders did espy some reflective objects from their vantage point — ore, if I had to guess.
Utsil: By the way, did you know that gem-related cards have some rather intriguing uses... Sorry, bit off-topic. If you need Condessence Crystals or something, you can just head over here.

Traveler: Victory in what?
Utsil: In a duel, of course!
Utsil: I've got all the Saurian blessing cards — I mean, all the Saurian cards — plus a deck with Saurian feathers... *ahem* I mean, the latest custom cards...
Utsil: So I'll be invincible come the next match! Victory is 100% guaranteed to the proudest of players — and that's me, bay-bee!
Utsil: Of course, I still have to thank my teacher, Acat, for carefully drawing up a deck of Qucusaurus cards for me. I wish her business at Chuwen Fair all the prosperity it deserves.

Traveler: I thought you were talking about combat...
Utsil: Ah, if it's combat we're talking about, then the cool factor doesn't really apply, right? That's a whole different kettle of fish from tabletop card games.
Utsil: I may have gotten a little heated just now when talking about Genius Invokation TCG, but please don't paint me as some sort of battle-freak.
Utsil: Even if a warrior staggers off the battlefield, if they defeat their enemy and make it back home alive, then they're the final winners nonetheless.

Traveler: This is pretty cool too.
Utsil: ...I tried to imagine it, and what you said does make sense.
Utsil: But I must say, the battlefield's no place for those who just want to look cool! Winning is what matters.
