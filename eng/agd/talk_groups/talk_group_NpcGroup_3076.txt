Traveler: Can you tell me more about Ritou?
Ebina Gonshirou: The entirety of Ritou falls under the jurisdiction of the Kanjou Commission.
Ebina Gonshirou: While the Sakoku Decree is in effect, an outlander such as yourself must verify your identity and report your itinerary whether you are entering, leaving, or staying.
Ebina Gonshirou: Don't say that I didn't remind you. If you are rude to Miss Kageyama... Ahem, I mean the inspector, you will be deported right away.

Traveler: Could you tell me more about the Sakoku Decree?
Ebina Gonshirou: Hmph, what else do you need to know? Since it's the decision of our Almighty Shogun, many careful considerations must have been made.
Ebina Gonshirou: It's not a matter for people such as ourselves to discuss... Let alone outlanders like you!

Traveler: Goodbye.
Ebina Gonshirou: Stop idling about here. Hurry up and cooperate with the work of the Kanjou Commission.

Traveler: Who is Miss Kageyama?
Ebina Gonshirou: You don't even know who Miss Kageyama is? I don't think you should be in Ritou!
Ebina Gonshirou: Miss Kageyama is an inspector at the Outlander Affairs Agency who is in charge of entry permits for outlanders like you.
Ebina Gonshirou: If you still wish to remain in Inazuma, you'd better get those documents and gifts prepared before visiting the inspector!

Ebina Gonshirou: Miss Kageyama is an inspector at the Outlander Affairs Agency who is in charge of keeping an eye out for outlanders like you.
Ebina Gonshirou: There sure are lot more outlanders now the Sakoku Decree has been abolished... Looks like Ms. Kageyama's job is about to get a whole lot busier...
Ebina Gonshirou: If only I could help her out...
Ebina Gonshirou: *cough* Ahem. Whatever the case, if you wish to have a decent time in Ritou, you'd better get those documents and gifts prepared before visiting the inspector!
