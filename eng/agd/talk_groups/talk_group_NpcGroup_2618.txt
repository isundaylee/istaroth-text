Khedive: #Oh? Why, hello there! I thought you'd left, Traveler.
Khedive: The energy readings around here have stabilized a great deal, thanks to you. When I go back and write my thesis, I will mention you for sure.
Khedive: However, as the nominal employer of the exploration team, I will still need to stay for a long time to observe this place.

Traveler: So, how's your research going?
Khedive: Since you've helped me so much so far, I could tell you a few things, no problem.
Khedive: We came here to monitor the anomalous energies that have been radiating from deep below and study the effects they are having on The Chasm.
Khedive: It seems clear now, though, that the situation we face is far more complex than we first imagined.
Khedive: If it wasn't for your valor, I doubt that we'd have gotten anywhere near as much data as we have.

## Talk 3

Khedive: How's Zhiqiong...
Khedive: Zhiqiong's condition has worsened. What on earth is she being so stubborn about, honestly...
Khedive: I gave her some medicine. It should be able to at least slow some of the more serious symptoms, so her situation is stabilizing...
Khedive: I'm no adventurer, and I can't claim to understand their desires, but I have no wish to watch someone else suffer before my eyes like this...
Khedive: *sigh* Forget it. I hope she's more amenable to your logic.

## Talk 4

Khedive: #Hello, Traveler! It's great to see you here.
Traveler: What are you doing here?
Khedive: A field study, to record and research ancient life forms and their remains. Well, and I'm also here to observe the abnormalities in the geological layers.
Paimon: And you're not going down there yourself?
Khedive: Me? Go down there? No, of course not.
Khedive: I mean, I did pay for this exploration team to be set up. I'll fork out the Mora, you do the work. My research gets done, you get paid. I'm happy, you're happy. See?
Khedive: That's how that works.
Paimon: ...This guy is really annoying.
Traveler: Bye.
Khedive: Well, don't let me keep you too long.

## Talk 5

Khedive: What a curious geological environment we're in now! I'm sure I can outdo the research goals set by the Akademiya this year.
Khedive: Oh, Traveler, what's up?

Traveler: So, about these mushrooms...
Khedive: No wonder they say you're an experienced adventurer — You came back with new findings so soon.
Khedive: Huh? Are you sure you found them here? How strange...
Traveler: Is it strange for mushrooms to grow underground?
Khedive: That's not what I mean.
Khedive: It's just that they look similar to an indigenous mushroom in Sumeru.
Khedive: I can't be sure yet with what we've got here. If I have enough samples, I might be able to arrive at a conclusion.
Khedive: Speaking of which... Since you found it, you must know where to get more. Could you lend a hand?
Khedive: Bring me enough mushrooms and I'll pay you handsomely.
Traveler: So, how many is enough?
Khedive: Mmm... Lemme think. Please bring me eight for starters.
Khedive: Don't worry. So long as you bring them to me, I'll make sure to repay you in full!

### Talk 5 related talk 1

Traveler: About the strange object...
Khedive: Did you fish this up from the water? Hmm. Actually, at first glance, this thing does look like a fishing bait.
Khedive: Is it normal for people to come across this kind of stuff while fishing? Anisa never misses a single day fishing on Watatsumi Island, but she's never discovered anything special.
Khedive: Perhaps it's the fisher that makes the difference, then?
Khedive: Let me check. Mm, I can sense an incredibly high concentration of Hydro energy within it.
Khedive: The groundwater in The Chasm does contain unusually rich elemental power. Does that have anything to do with things like this growing within it?
Khedive: But ever since you fished it up, its elemental energy has been ebbing away. Maybe we need to place it by the water to see what its power is capable of.
Traveler: Place it by the water?
Khedive: Yes, and also activate it with Hydro energy. I suspect that it'll reveal its secrets to us then.
Khedive: How about you go activate it? — I mean, since you're the one who fished it up and all. Let me know if you get any results.
Khedive: I'll pay you if your findings are of academic value.

### Talk 5 related talk 2

Traveler: About the strange rock we found...
Khedive: So, you took a picture or two of some strange rocks?
Khedive: Do show me, please!
Traveler: Here you are...
Khedive: Ah! Look at the picture! It's so clear — seems the new Kamera models from Fontaine are as good as they say.
Khedive: I once bought some prototype ones, but the images captured weren't clear enough. Besides, they were too clumsy to be handled by one person alone. So they ended up rotting away in some corner in the Akademiya.
Traveler: Rotting away...
Khedive: Yep, it cost me a meal's worth of Mora. Um... Looks like it's time that I bought some new Kameras.
Khedive: But anyway, I've digressed. Let me have a look. This rock...
Khedive: Yes, it's a fossil!
Traveler: A fossil?
Khedive: Yes, and you can see many fossilized marine creatures in it... How curious! In Liyue, there's a saying for this — I don't know the exact wording, but it goes something like "forests and fields are eventually engulfed by the vast ocean."
Khedive: The fact that the fossil appears in The Chasm proves that these creatures were buried underground in an instant. Otherwise, their skeletons wouldn't be so perfectly preserved.
Khedive: By the way, I heard that this place has frequent earthquakes. It makes sense, as one of the prerequisites for fossil formation is active geological movements.
Khedive: This finding will certainly shed new light on our understanding of the ancient creatures that once inhabited this place...
Khedive: But I think I could use a few more pictures.
Khedive: If you come across other such fossils, please take pictures for me.
Traveler: How many do you need?
Khedive: Let me see. I need four or five for my report... You know what? Let's make it five. Bring me five pictures of similar rocks.
Khedive: I'll offer a reasonable price for this, of course. It is a big discovery, and that is no understatement.
Traveler: That's a bit of a waste...

Traveler: Here're the mushrooms you asked for.
Khedive: You have my thanks.
Khedive: With your help, my research is — what do they call it in Liyue? — "as smooth as a cat soaring in the air."
Traveler: Like a winged tiger?
Khedive: Yes, like a winged tiger!
Khedive: What happened to these fungi?
Khedive: How strange. They look almost identical to an indigenous species in Sumeru save for the fluorescein. Why? Is it because they've evolved in the darkness?
Khedive: But why does their look remain the same after the evolution?
Traveler: You've lost me...
Khedive: Hmm... Simply put, fungi evolve to adapt to their surrounding environment, but by the looks of it, this type of fungi is more suited to living in forest environments.
Khedive: That's why I'm so certain of their Sumeru origin.
Traveler: So, why do they glow?
Khedive: Since they aren't an indigenous species of The Chasm, they didn't evolve to glow. Rather, the glowing is a result of some abnormal ecological phenomenon...
Khedive: It's probably because of the fragment that fell from the sky. After absorbing its energy...
Traveler: The fragment?
Khedive: Ahem... Huh? What did you say? Something about a "fragment"? Um, I mean, when the fragments of fungi fell from the sky, they must've...
Khedive: ...Undergone some random mutation.
Khedive: That must be it!
Khedive: Uh... Thank you for collecting these fungi. It's been a busy day. Please go get some rest, you've earned it!
Khedive: I'm gonna study them now, so if you wouldn't mind leaving me alone for a bit...
Traveler: What is it?
Traveler: Is anything not adding up?

### Talk 5 related talk 4

Traveler: About the strange object by the water...
Khedive: Huh? Have you placed it by the water?
Khedive: How is it? Did anything special happen?
Traveler: A Geovishap showed up.
Khedive: A Geovishap? It turned into a Geovishap in the water!?
Khedive: Oh, you mean that it didn't turn into a Geovishap, but rather, attracted one over.
Khedive: My heart almost stopped there! If it really had turned into a Geovishap, my whole world-view would have been shattered.
Traveler: So what exactly is that thing?
Khedive: The answer is simple. How should I put it? Mmm, well why don't you tell me first if there was anything special about that Geovishap?
Khedive: Did it, say, wield Hydro?
Traveler: Something like that.
Khedive: That's about right.
Khedive: That Geovishap is probably able to use Hydro.
Khedive: The groundwater in The Chasm contains dense Hydro energies. As such, certain high-concentration spots have become the nurturing grounds for the waterweed-like object that you fished up.
Khedive: The Geovishap — and other water-loving creatures in The Chasm, too — has increased its power by feeding on these waterweeds that are rich in Hydro.
Khedive: So that thing is... just some waterweed rich in Hydro elements!
Traveler: Just some waterweed, huh...
Khedive: Yep, waterweed — only that it contains exceedingly dense Hydro elemental energy.
Khedive: You don't usually find it in ordinary environments — unless some immense, pure power has altered the source of the water... Forget it, these waterweeds...
Khedive: It could turn into sentient elemental beings one day. You know what? This would make a fine research topic.
Traveler: I didn't notice it.
Khedive: #You must've taken it out too quickly to notice its special trait. How impressive, as expected of the legendary Traveler.
Khedive: But here's my hypothesis...
