Cellar Guard Raven: Halt! This is a restricted area. I cannot simply let you through...
Traveler: There's a raven sleeping in the elevator...
Cellar Guard Raven: Sleeping in the elevator? That cannot be true! I saw nothing of the sort...
Traveler: I've come to check the elevator...
Cellar Guard Raven: Ah, that... Alright then. Check it and leave as soon as possible.
