Traveler: Scarabs?
Nawaz: Huh, you don't know what Scarabs are? They're the most awesome bugs ever!
Nawaz: They have the coolest shells, the coolest patterns, and they shine the coolest gold under the sun!
Nawaz: I've heard the adults say that Scarabs contain something truly amazing, put inside them by King Deshret himself so that they can protect us.
Nawaz: I mean, doesn't that just sound like the best thing ever?
