Haniyyah: If you're not too busy, come back and play anytime.
Traveler: Play another round.
Souka: That's right! I always get more design ideas from watching you, so please, play to your heart's content!
Traveler: See you later!
Haniyyah: We'll be in Fontaine for a while, so I look forward to seeing you again when you're done with whatever you're doing.
Souka: It's alright if you can't make time, though. No matter where you go, we will do our best to catch up to you. I'm sure we'll see each other again!
