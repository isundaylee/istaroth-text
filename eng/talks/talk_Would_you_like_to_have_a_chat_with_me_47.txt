# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Diona: Uhh, I'm actually pretty busy here!
Diona: ...Still, I suppose a quick chat won't hurt.
Diona: Let's do it â€” I know lots of great topics!
Traveler: Do you chat with other people a lot?
Diona: Well... the old drunkards try to chat with me all the time.
Diona: I never answer them, but that's still not enough to shut them up!
Diona: I always make a point of making them the most disgusting cocktail I can come up with.
Diona: But they drain every last drop and then ask for another glass! Ugh!
Diona: Why do things have to be this way...?
Traveler: What do you like to chat about?
Diona: ...I like to share my hunting tips with others, but...
Diona: ...The guys at the tavern only wanna talk about the harvest, girls they like, card game strategies... stuff like that.
Diona: I hate it. I make it pretty obvious that I'm not listening, but there's always someone at the bar rattling on to me.
