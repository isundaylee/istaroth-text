Traveler: Tell me about Inazuma...
Furuya Noboru: You want to know more about the geography of Inazuma? Ahem... No problem!
Furuya Noboru: I figure that you must've come to Narukami Island from Ritou through Konda Village, right? Then I need not mention them, though there are some urban legends about Byakko Plain, which is also on that path. Who knows if those are true or not?
Furuya Noboru: To the north of Inazuma City, you will find the Grand Narukami Shrine on the mountaintop. The great Sacred Sakura tree at the shrine is a truly spectacular sight.
Furuya Noboru: Beneath the Grand Narukami Shrine are Mt. Yougou and the Chinju Forest. It's very difficult to climb Mt. Yougou. There are also legends about bake-danuki running amok in the Chinju Forest. Be extra careful if you go there.
