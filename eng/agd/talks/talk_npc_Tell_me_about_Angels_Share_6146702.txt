# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Tell me about Angel's Share.
Patton: It was way back when the Dawn Winery was just established when the owner of the winery opened this tavern.
Patton: The winery's owner, Master Diluc, still holds the deed to Angel's Share. He really has taken the business to the next level.
Patton: "The best in Mondstadt" is the truth.
Patton: Master Diluc serves the customers here personally when he's in a good mood, and let Charles off for a day or two.
Patton: If you see him here, be respectful. He is Mondstadt's tycoon, you know...
Traveler: Tell me about the wine industry in Mondstadt.
Patton: Mondstadt's climate, water, and crops are all perfect for making wine... I have to agree, we are blessed by the Anemo Archon!
Patton: Apple cider and cherry ciders all taste mighty nice â€” I forgot to mention dandelion wine! That's one of a kind!
Patton: By exporting to Liyue's trade unions, Mondstadt's wines will be sold all over the continent.
Patton: They make incredible sales over there. Some even call it "bottled Mora."
Patton: This must be why Dawn Winery's owner is so filthy rich...
Traveler: Tell me about yourself.
Patton: Let me give you a piece of advice... Don't touch any of the bottles here, no matter how plain it looks...
Patton: The bottle I broke happened to be the last owner's collector's red wine... Do you see the villa to the north over there?
Patton: What I mean is, that wine cost as much as that villa.
Patton: By my calculations, I need to work 48 more years to pay it back... without sleeping and eating.
Patton: Well... It doesn't seem THAT hopeless if I think about it like that.
Patton: I need to get back to buying back my freedom... Hahaha... *coughs* *sobs*
