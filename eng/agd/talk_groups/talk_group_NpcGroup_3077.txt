Traveler: Tell me more about yourself, for starters...
Obata: This island is my hometown. My whole family has been fishermen for generations. Naturally, I am a fisherman myself as well.
Obata: ...But nowadays, even fishermen have become rare.
Obata: Apart from restricting entry of outlanders to Inazuma, the Sakoku Decree also limits the areas in which we can sail.
Obata: Many fishermen have changed jobs as a result. I am still here because of this vast ocean.
Obata: More accurately, I can hear this ocean calling to me all the time...

Traveler: Mind telling me a bit about yourself?
Obata: This island is my hometown. My whole family has been fishermen for generations. Naturally, I am a fisherman myself as well.
Obata: Due to the Sakoku Decree limiting our ability to go out to sea, we fishermen temporarily became a rare sight indeed...
Obata: But those problems are all in the past now! The Sakoku Decree's gone for good — not only have the restrictions on fishing been lifted, but our Ritou clientele's grown, too!
Obata: It's time! I shall once again answer the call of the ocean, hahaha!

Traveler: About the Sakoku Decree...
Obata: I'm not educated enough to know much about politics. As far as I am concerned, it's a decision that's resulted in lots of unhappiness.
Obata: The Sakoku Decree has not just decreased the volume of our customers, the limited sailing range has also made fishing a very tough job.
Obata: Ah, a fisherman who cannot sail freely is no different from a beached, salted fish... I really don't understand what is going on in the minds of those bigwigs...

Traveler: The sea's call?
Obata: Yeah! Do you hear it? The sound of the waves crashing against the beaches, the sound of fishes swimming through the waves...
Obata: Eh? You still don't get it?
Obata: ...Hahahaha, you must be an outlander. That's to be expected!
Obata: Here, I'll give you some of my catch. After you live by the ocean for a while, you'll start to understand the romantic nature of the sea!
