# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Oh, sorry...
Smiley Yanxiao: It's fine. Kindness should be repaid in kind and however it goes.
Smiley Yanxiao: I'm hardly about to kick you out, not after you helped me with that ghost problem and all.
Traveler: Tell me a bit about your life to date.
Smiley Yanxiao: What're you asking that for? Aren't you here to cook?
Smiley Yanxiao: You're not the first person to show surprise at me working as a chef, though.
Smiley Yanxiao: My story goes like this: I actually used to be a thief until I stole from the boss.
Smiley Yanxiao: I took a beating for it and was locked up for a while.
Smiley Yanxiao: After I got out, the boss took me on to help out in the kitchen.
Smiley Yanxiao: I find I'm much happier as a sous-chef than I was as a thief.
Smiley Yanxiao: I feel like this is the real me.
Traveler: How've things been going lately?
Smiley Yanxiao: Pretty good. Ever since then, I've stopped seeing anything weird.
Smiley Yanxiao: But even if something pops up again, I'll be fine. The boss met an exorcist called Chongyun through some friends.
Smiley Yanxiao: If another ghost pops up, we'll call him in. Besides, they say he's pretty good at his job.
