Traveler: About the Weinlesefest...
Lawrence: Weinlesefest is an autumn festival to celebrate the harvest of the Mondstadters. We use the fruits of the harvest to make drinks to dedicate to the Anemo Archon. He will then bless everyone with the West Wind.
Lawrence: That said, for Mondstadters, it doesn't matter whether Lord Barbatos actually shows up or not. The festival is just a good time to drink lots of wine.
Lawrence: Although drunk people are troublesome, I can't really say anything when I see nothing but uplifted spirits from drinking.
Lawrence: After all, everyone has worked hard all year and deserves a good celebration.
