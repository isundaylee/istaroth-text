*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Lessig: As a descendant of the illustrious Lawrence Clan, I learned many skills during my journey, for example... baking flatbread!
Lessig: Good, this should be just the right amount of heat.
Eula: I had no idea you knew how to bake... I thought you'd be the type who'd never get anywhere near the kitchen.
Lessig: Ah, I've been meaning to ask you... Do you have time later? Could you teach me how to make those delectable snacks of yours?
Eula: Oh? But that might take some time. Besides, we're not here to get to know each other as family.
Lessig: So again you're worried about our ties within the Lawrence family, fine... But you said yourself that we're just ordinary people, so why don't we learn from each other like regular cousins would?

### Additional Talk 2

Klee: I wanna ride the Choo-Choo Cart with Miss General! Up, up, up, and... WEEEE!!! But uh, I guess the ride makes her a little dizzy...
Kaeya: Ah, so you noticed? Very good. Was it the stars spinning in her dazed eyes that gave it away?
Klee: Mm-hmm, yesterday she said she had lots of little golden stars floating around her. But she seems to be doing a lot better today.
Klee: If Mom were here, she'd probably say the stars are all fish that fell into the clouds!

### Additional Talk 3

Collei: This is the first time I've had tea that tastes like this. It seems Inazuman tea is a lot different from what we have in Sumeru.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ah yes, it seems people in Sumeru like to put spices in their tea, right?
Collei: Yes, that's right! But I still can't get used to it... If I had to pick, I'd drink coffee, even though it gives me insomnia sometimes.

### Additional Talk 4

Idyia: Oh! How is everything? Discover anything new?
Idyia: Let me know if you find anything interesting.
