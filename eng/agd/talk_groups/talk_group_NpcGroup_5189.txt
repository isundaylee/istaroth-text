Crapet: Mademoiselle Hilmer, I'll repeat myself one more time â€” you can't sail here. It endangers both your own safety and that of the other vessels.
Hilmer: I didn't intend on going sailing. I only want to float right by the shore and do some fishing.
Crapet: I'm sorry, Mademoiselle, but that constitutes sailing. You need to register at the harbor and prepare the necessary documentation...
Hilmer: Nonsense! Take a look for yourself. This raft is more like a pile of planks than a proper seafaring vessel. I have no intention of drifting into the shipping lanes. I only want to float just off the shore!
Crapet: As far as the regulations are concerned, this "raft" of yours must be treated just like any other vessel.
Crapet: And I must inform you that when large cargo ships pass by, they create significant chop as well as undercurrents.
Crapet: Even if you don't enter the shipping lanes, for your own safety, I cannot allow you to stay on the water under any circumstances.
Hilmer: Fine. If I want to get in some angling without being bothered, what do I have to do to be in compliance with the law?
Crapet: Honestly, I'm not familiar with fishing regulations. But if you merely want to go out on the water, my first suggestion would be to get yourself a proper boat.
Crapet: Or at the very least, get something that could be more unambiguously categorized as such.
