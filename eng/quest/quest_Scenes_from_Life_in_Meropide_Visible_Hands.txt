# Scenes from Life in Meropide: Visible Hands


## Talk 1

Decembre: #Well, well! If it isn't {NICKNAME} and Paimon!
Traveler: Do we know you?
Decembre: Don't be so cold. I'll never forget what you did for me that other time.
Paimon: That other time... Ah! We still have so much to ask you!
Decembre: I—Is that so? Ugh, oh, what's this? My memory, it's acting up again! What happened then, I wonder? I can't remember a thing!
Decembre: The wise say it's better to look toward the future than look back into the past. So let's talk about our future collaboration, and let bygones be bygones, shall we?
Decembre: I have a few jobs on hand that pay quite well, but I don't have anyone to help out. If you're free, would you like to have a go?
Paimon: Hmph! Don't you go thinking we're that easy to dupe...
Traveler: And just how good is the compensation?
Paimon: Hey!
Decembre: This is why I'm so fond of talking business with people like you. What do they call it again? Right, being quick to catch on!
Decembre: How about I state a number that's guaranteed to satisfy you?
Decembre: A hundred Coupons! What do you think?
Paimon: A hundred!?
Decembre: Mmm, I see you are moved by my generosity.
Traveler: That won't even buy us a bottle cork.
Paimon: Yeah! Paimon can't believe you had the gall to make that offer!
Decembre: Am I not being generous enough? You young 'uns really are so... You just don't know what's good for you!
Decembre: You should know, there're hordes of poor wretches who'd give an arm to do easy and profitable work like this...
Maupoil: Decembre, you slippery little fraud, I've finally caught you! Last time I caught you hanging around the mail room, you were also swindling newcomers into commissions for you for a fraction of the actual fee...
Maupoil: #{NICKNAME} and Paimon? You didn't fall for his lies, did you?
Traveler: I'm devastated... We've already been tricked once!
Maupoil: *sigh* Then I'm too late.
Maupoil: Anyways, don't believe a word he says. He targets newcomers or anyone unaware of the rules and cheats them. There's already a long list of victims.
Decembre: My word, "swindle"!? You make it sound so awful. Is there any difference between us? Don't you guards use Coupons to make people do miscellaneous work for you, too?
Maupoil: We don't pocket a portion of their compensation.
Decembre: What are you hinting at? Don't slander me without any proof!
Maupoil: Oh, you want to see some proof? Let's go then. Solitary is quiet and spacious — a perfect place for you to peruse all the proof. Seriously, I still have trouble to deal with at the Geode Mine Shaft after this...
Maupoil: #Oh, {NICKNAME} and Paimon. If possible, could you help me...
Paimon: Hey, it's not like we have all the time in the world, either!
Traveler: I'm sure you pay handsomely — I'll do it.
Paimon: Hey!
Maupoil: Haha! Payment will be provided in accordance with regulations, of course. I'm sure you know the standards, and you know I won't try to defraud you.
Maupoil: Anyway, some Fontemer Aberrants have been spotted in the Geode Mine Shaft... They may pose a threat if left unchecked, so they must be dealt with as soon as possible.
Maupoil: I'll take this guy to solitary first. Handing him over to my colleagues will take some time... I'll meet up with you as soon as I'm done.
Paimon: Alright, but don't take too long.
Maupoil: I'll do my best. But the paperwork... It's not something I can speed up. I'll leave the business at the mine shaft to you then.
Traveler: But not this time.
Maupoil: This time?
Paimon: Uh... Things happened before this...
Traveler: I'll pay you 100, you work, and I'll profit.
Paimon: Whoa! Is that what you were planning!?
Traveler: I have a bad feeling about this...

## Talk 2

Paimon: You're only just arriving here now? We've already driven away all the Fontemer Aberrants.
Maupoil: So, it's finally happened to me.
Paimon: What's finally happened?
Maupoil: Arriving at the scene and finding out that all the work has been done by someone else, of course! I mean, there's nothing for me to do here.
Maupoil: This is for you. Thank you so much! I'll certainly manage to get a good night's sleep tonight!
