Traveler: How are you doing lately?
Saimon Jirou: Not too bad, all thanks to you.
Saimon Jirou: The Tenryou Commission has been here asking about my whereabouts as well. Good thing dad covered for me.
Saimon Jirou: He somehow went and got a certificate saying I was unfit for service. Of course, the name on it says "Saimon Katsumi"!
Saimon Jirou: Though it was quite expensive, at least I don't have to worry about being treated as a deserter...
