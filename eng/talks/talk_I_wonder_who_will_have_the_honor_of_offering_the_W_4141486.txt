Donna: I wonder who will have the honor of offering the Windblume to Lord Barbatos this year?
Donna: Ah, I'm so envious. If only I could be the one. Everyone's eyes would be on me...
Donna: (And who knows? Maybe Diluc might notice me if I'm the one offering flowers...)
Donna: (That would be so wonderful... Oh gosh, he's all I can think about, isn't he...)
