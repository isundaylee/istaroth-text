Traveler: The Consilium Sapientium?
Tiepolo: Trust in the wisdom of the elderly is a tradition here. Since ancient times, all affairs in the town have been assessed by a committee of its elders.
Tiepolo: And of these elders, the most trustworthy would be selected as "Doge."
Tiepolo: And that is me, old and unskilled though I may be.
Tiepolo: Though given the role of overseer, I must say that there is little for me to oversee here. We live simple lives and have simple customs. All we do, we do by tradition.
