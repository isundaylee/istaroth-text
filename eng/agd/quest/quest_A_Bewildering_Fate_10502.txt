# A Bewildering Fate


## Talk 1

Mona: Are you ready? Don't shame your master now — we're about to meet that successor.
Traveler: I can't tell fortunes...
Mona: I guess... Wait, no! It won't do if you have no idea at all, even if you are a fake disciple.
Mona: We have a rule that forbids us from teaching outsiders, but I suppose... I suppose I could teach you.
Mona: My astrology is based on hydromancy, and as the name suggests, I use the reflections in water bodies to observe the true starry sky.
Mona: Allow me to demonstrate. Watch closely now.
Mona: From the present station and movement of the stars... I see, so that successor is a young... female... Knight of Favonius.
Paimon: Doesn't that sound like... Lisa?
Mona: We will meet her here presently.
Mona: Well, that's all the information we need.
Traveler: Th—That's all?
Mona: *sigh* It seems that even basic astrology can't be grasped in one go.
Mona: Never mind. I'll explain in detail later — she's here.
Klee: #Wow, it's you, {F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight! And Paimon too! You're back!
Mona: That's her! The successor to great knowledge!
Traveler: ...You mean Klee!?
Klee: Successor...?
Mona: That's right. I am the astrologist who has plumbed the depths of the ocean of stars. Surely, you have long calculated my arrival as well.
Klee: An ocean of stars? What's that? Does it have fish in it?
Mona: Fish...? No, don't play dumb. Is this some kind of game?
Klee: I should be the one saying that! I didn't get what you said at all!
Traveler: We're getting nowhere fast.
Mona: But my predictions can't be mistaken... Well, let's make sure. Your mother's name is Alice, isn't it?
Klee: That's right! Oh, so you're Mommy's friend! But she's gone very far away...
Mona: My readings told me as much. But before she left, she must have imparted her mystical arts to you, surely?
Klee: Mystical... arts? I... don't get it. Mommy only taught me to make Jumpy Dumpties.
Paimon: So Klee's mother is the friend and rival of Mona's teacher?
Mona: Yes. As well-versed in astrology as she was, my master knew only astrology. Alice, on the other hand, was skilled in a great many other mystical fields.
Paimon: Well... Klee's so young, so even if she'd heard this deep knowledge, she might not have understood.
Mona: Yes. It seems she has inherited the blood, but not the knowledge... what a miscalculation. There can be no contest like this.
Mona: Ah, yes. So, before Alice left, did she tell you about a fifty-year agreement, and about a certain box?
Klee: Ooh, I know this one! So you're here for that box. I'll look. Wait here!
Klee: Hmm... Not this one...
Klee: Hmm... Hm... Or this one...
Klee: No, no, it's not this one either...
Klee: Ah! I remember now. I buried it together with my new treasure, at *Windrise*!
Traveler: It's a bomb again, isn't it?
Klee: Wait for me. I'll be right back!
Paimon: Klee, don't just run off! Don't you need the things in your pack?
Mona: I'll help her pack these things back in. You go after her.
Mona: *sigh* Looking at how rash she is, I worry for the box...
Traveler: Why do you always bury important things outdoors?
Traveler: See, I said this was a mistake.
Traveler: There must be some mistake!
Traveler: I haven't had a chance to look yet.
Traveler: I can't read the stars...

## Talk 2

Klee: We're heeere! This is it. Let's dig it up!
Traveler: This has to be the work of Dendro Slimes.
Klee: It can't be. I put up a sign here. There's no mistake—
Klee: Argh! Dendro Slimes!
Traveler: Yup. Dendro Slimes.
Paimon: *sigh* We can talk later, let's take them out first!
Traveler: Dendro Slimes must have done this.

## Talk 3

Klee: Found it! It's this box.
Paimon: Glad it wasn't damaged in the explosions.
Klee: Retrieval complete! Let's bring it back!

## Talk 4

Mona: You're back at last. The wait was exceedingly dull.
Mona: I had intended to read a book to pass the time, but this one was just some ridiculous diary. Nothing of note in it at all.
Mona: It dropped from Klee's backpack, so I thought it might contain some ancient knowledge, but...
Mona: Never mind that. So, did you find the box?
Klee: We did. It's in perfect shape!
Mona: That's wonderful— Wait a moment... Wh—Why isn't it locked!? And... why is it empty!?
Paimon: Ehhh!?
Klee: Well... it's because I borrowed this box to store my treasures.
Mona: Borrowed!?
Klee: But since you're here for the box, I took all my treasures out. That's why it's empty.
Mona: You used it to store your things!? Th—Then where are the original contents of the box? That's what I want.
Klee: Oh. You want the thing that used to be in the box? ...You should've said so.
Mona: You haven't... broken it, have you?
Klee: No! It's not broken at all!
Mona: Phew...
Klee: It's the book in your hand.
Mona: Whaaaaaaat—!?
Mona: Th—This... So this book, this diary... is that hag's... It's her diary from 50 years ago!?
Mona: The thing she wanted back after 50 years was the dark history of her youth?
Mona: Ah, I'm finished! No wonder... No wonder that old woman said that I should not look at it no matter what, or she'd rip me to shreds...
Klee: Am... Am I in trouble?
Klee: Ah! It was you who said you wanted the box. You didn't say anything about the thing inside!
Klee: I don't know anything. I'm leaving! Bye!
Traveler: What a touching conclusion...
Paimon: Umm... Well, if you don't say anything, your master won't find out, will she?
Mona: Impossible. Astrology can see through all lies — you've seen it yourself.
Mona: *sigh* After having spent all my Mora to come to Mondstadt, not only have I gained no knowledge, but now I can't return... How did it come to this...
Paimon: That's so sad... Maybe you could forget everything in that book, and then go back?
Mona: That's... too difficult. And even if I wanted to stay in Mondstadt, it would be...
Traveler: Too embarrassing?
Mona: Yes. How can I maintain a proper astrologist's mentality if I stay with all these philistines?
Paimon: Well, then you'll just have to go back and face your master.
Mona: S—Stop talking about it! I... I guess I'll have to...
Mona: I'll just have to stay in Mondstadt temporarily. Once that old crone's reached the end of her days, I'll be free.
Traveler: An intimidating resolution.
Mona: But what will I do about my astrology research? ...No, wait, I don't even have a place to stay.
Paimon: About that, we can go ask *Katheryne at the Adventurers' Guild*. Let's see if she can help.
Mona: The Adventurers' Guild? Ah, right, you can do commissions for them in exchange for... you know what I mean, don't you?
Traveler: Of course.
Mona: Oh. Um, thanks. I... Never mind, it's nothing.
Traveler: That was always the plan.
Traveler: Does that really count as "temporary"?
Traveler: Too expensive?
Mona: Yes— I mean, no! You really have no way with words.
Traveler: There's no point getting mad at Klee.

## Talk 5

Katheryne: About Mona's background and her quandary...
Katheryne: I see. I understand the situation.
Katheryne: There is a *magic laboratory* in Mondstadt that has been sealed by some unknown person.
Katheryne: Although we have a few specialists who could break the seal, they all have their own labs, and aren't that interested in the matter.
Katheryne: I believe that if the astrologist you mentioned can break the seal, the owner of that house wouldn't mind if she stayed there.
Traveler: I think she can do it.
Katheryne: Alright. Then, allow me to tell you where the house is.
Traveler: I'll take her to go have a look.

## Talk 6

Mona: The person who placed this seal... is by no means simple. Breaking this seal by force is nigh on impossible.
Mona: Interesting. I suppose it's worth using my astrology on.
Mona: Let me see... Hmm, I see, so if you first... ...and then you...
Mona: Alright, it's open.
Paimon: Holy moly, that's amazing!
Paimon: Now we just need to go back to Katheryne, and you'll be able to stay here!
Goth: No need, no need, you have my utmost thanks.
Mona: You are...?
Goth: Oh, I'm Goth, the owner of this house. I passed by the Adventurers' Guild a while back, and Katheryne told me about the matter.
Goth: I never thought this troublesome seal would be dispelled so quickly!
Mona: Does that mean I can stay here?
Goth: Of course, of course. The facilities inside were just being left there, anyway. I would be glad to have someone make use of them.
Goth: To express my thanks, I shall rent this building to you at the lowest possible price!
Mona: R—Rent?
Mona: I didn't hear anything about rent, and I helped out, too...
Goth: Yes, of course, I understand. I am most thankful to you for that, so rest assured that I will give you the best rates!
Mona: I... I mean...
Paimon: Paimon thinks Mona's misunderstood something, but...
Traveler: This might be her best option.
Mona: *sigh* I guess I don't have any other choice. I'll rent this place.
Goth: Great! Then we are agreed. I will go prepare the documentation, please wait here.
Mona: Thanks for your help. Also, well, I'm very sorry, but I won't be able to do what I agreed to help you with just yet.
Mona: Without the necessary tools, and without new knowledge, it will take me some time to see your destiny clearly.
Mona: But I promise that I'll do a reading for you first thing once I'm ready!
Traveler: As you said, this journey was all gain and no loss.
Mona: Thank you. Our traveling together was fate — and of the good kind, I'd say.
Mona: I wish you both safe travels! As for me... I need to think of the future as well.
Paimon: How is she going to make a living if she doesn't use astrology to make money?
Paimon: Maybe we should come back to check on her once in a while. It would really be bad if she fainted from hunger in there...
Traveler: Guess you've got to keep working at it, then.
Mona: Yes... I don't really know what to do, but... I'll do my best.
Traveler: Save a little here, scrimp a little there, and you'll be fine.

## Talk 7

Mona: That box is really important to me...
Mona: If anything were to happen to it, I wouldn't be able to report back to that old crone...

## Talk 8

Examine Door: (This door seems to be locked by a curious seal. I wonder whose place this is?)
