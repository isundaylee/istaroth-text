# Talk Dialog

Traveler: The name, "Floral Jelly"...
Balfour: Ha, I know what you're gonna say!
Balfour: I hear that the Vahumana researchers studied manuscripts from all over Teyvat and came to the preliminary conclusion that using certain suffixes in a name makes it sound extremely cute. I have to say, I kinda agree!
Balfour: Kautilya repeatedly emphasized that his research is "glorious and ground-breaking," and that it needed a name that's out of this world... But Mr. Elchingen rejected all of his proposals.
Balfour: Mr. Elchingen believed that since most people find Fungi to be cute little creatures, it would only be fitting if the official names used in the competition followed suit.
Balfour: After several heated debates, the name "Floral Jelly" was retained, along with the easy-to-understand name, "Wisdom Orb."
Balfour: But Mr. Elchingen did let Kautilya decide the other names. It's a good thing that most of those names are only used to communicate with future collaborators and aren't used by the contestants.
Paimon: What's with this Kautilya guy? It seems like he's always trying to show off how amazing he is. It seems like he's really pushy.
Traveler: He shouldn't do that, even if he truly is amazing.
Balfour: You think so too, huh?
Balfour: He doesn't get along with many of the staff. Even Mr. Elchingen has to make compromises with him at times.
Balfour: If it weren't for his irreplaceable technology and Mr. Elchingen continuously comforting the staff... the team of organizers probably would've fallen apart a long time ago.
Balfour: It's obvious why Kautilya kept running into dead ends before Mr. Elchingen sponsored him financially.
Traveler: Elchingen is clearly more reasonable.
