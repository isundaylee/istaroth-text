## Talk 1

Arapandu: #Nara Traveler and Paimon! Thanks to your help, the Varuna Contraption is now in good shape, and so is the Ashavan Realm.
Arakunti: All Aranara have returned to Vanarana for the celebration of Festival Utsava, like birds returning to their nests.
Aranakula: The angry rain becomes gentle again. And Aranakula finally gets to take care of the garden, growing Viparyas, happy Viparyas...
Arakara: Happy Viparyas make happy lanterns, and happy lanterns light the happy Festival Utsava...
Arakara: #Nara Traveler, Paimon, the garden is doing great now, and Festival Utsava was a blast. Thank you for your help with healing the Varuna Contraption and bringing Aranakula back.
Paimon: All's well that ends well! Hee-hee...
Traveler: Speaking of which... I'm quite curious about something...
Traveler: Why is Nara Varuna named Nara Varuna?
Arapandu: Oh, it's because that Nara helped us heal the Varuna Contraption.
Traveler: #Then what's her real name?
Arapandu: #Um... No idea. Nara Varuna never told us her real name.
Traveler: ...
Arabalika: #Nara Traveler has also helped a lot. Nara Traveler is a brave Nara and has overcome many difficulties. That we can gather here together at Festival Utsava makes me very happy.
Arakunti: #We have something for Nara Traveler.
Arapandu: This is how Aranara say thank you.
Aranakula: #Nara Traveler will like it, and so will Paimon.
Arabalika: Here is an Aranara flower for brave Nara and Paimon.
Arakara: #Arakara also has a flower. It's not a Viparyas, but still, it's for Nara Traveler and Paimon!
Arapandu: #Nara Traveler, Paimon, thanks for everything you did for Vana. We Aranara will never forget our friends!
Traveler: I see.

## Talk 2

Ararycan: #Nara Traveler and Paimon! Don't worry. The baddies that made Vanarana sick won't be coming back!
Ararycan: #Thank you, Nara Traveler and Paimon for helping Ararycan protect Vanarana. Ararycan has flowers for you!
Ararycan: Take the flowers, friends of Ararycan!

## Talk 3

Aranaga: Festival Utsava... Feels familiar... Eh? It's White Floaty... and the Golden Nara.
Aranakin: It's the Nara friend, and the Nara friend's friend. Hope you will have fun during Festival Utsava.
Aragaru: A friend's friend is also our friend! Golden Nara and White Floaty are both Aragaru's friends!
