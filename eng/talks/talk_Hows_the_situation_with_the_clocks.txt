Traveler: How's the situation with the clocks?
Puca: According to Mr. Chesil, he'll soon be able to make new, beautiful clocks.
Puca: He even took me on a tour of the place where they process the stones. The pretty stones were cut up into tiny, tiny pieces...
Puca: I didn't quite get what was going on, but Mr. Chesil said that those stones will turn into the hearts of those clocks...
Puca: Him saying that made me so happy, too.
Puca: But he says that he's going to exchange more Mora for more stones...
Puca: Mora is very shiny, but every coin looks the same â€” I don't wanna exchange my stones for those.
