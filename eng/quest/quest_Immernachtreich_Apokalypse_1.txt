# Immernachtreich Apokalypse


## Talk 1

Solemn Raven: Hey, stop! Who are you?
Severe Raven: You don't look like citizens of the Immernachtreich. Explain yourselves! What's your purpose here?
Paimon: This place even comes with guards!
Traveler: Don't panic.
Paimon: Uh... What are you doing?
Traveler: We are personal retainers of the Prinzessin.
Traveler: We've traveled through the sea of stars to get here.
Solemn Raven: How can you prove that you are Her Highness's retainers?
Mona: Hmph, such an absurd question betrays your ignorance.
Mona: "May my people be freed from the shackles of ancient decrees."
Severe Raven: Th—That's the password of the Immernachtreich! They really are Her Highness's retainers!
Solemn Raven: Oh my goodness. We didn't know! Please forgive us...
Paimon: Now step down!
Solemn Raven: Y—Yes, we're leaving now...
Paimon: They are gone.
Kaedehara Kazuha: This is the second volume of "Hymn of the Holy Land." Everyone ready?
Paimon: Bring it on!

## Talk 2

Narrator: "However, the Immernachtreich soon became plagued by a perpetual nightmare. Tasraque, the wicked dragon, infiltrated the subterranean, crossed the bottom of the sea, and eventually came to roam above the capital."
Xinyan: Huh? A dragon? The only thing I noticed is the gloomy weather.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Could the dragon be... some kind of metaphor?
Mona: If that's so... Her arch-nemesis, Tasraque, the wicked dragon, is made up of everything that opposes her and rejects her fantasies.

## Talk 3

Leon: Oh, thank goodness... Huh? What are you guys doing here!?
Mona: We should be the ones asking that. What are you doing here?

## Talk 4

Leon: I'm sorry you have to keep seeing me in such a wretched state. I suppose I'm still not good enough to play the role of a qualified Nachtraben Ritter...
Kaedehara Kazuha: "Play the role"?
Leon: I'm ashamed to admit it, but I'm not a real knight... rather, I'm a new actor who recently landed a job to play the role of a knight in a theater troupe!
Paimon: That's not really something to be smug about.
Leon: Ah, well, you see, that's where you're mistaken! Theater is an essential part of Immernachtreich's culture. A fantastic theatrical performance is the greatest tribute we can pay to Her Highness.
Xinyan: Oh, so this is your local culture?
Leon: Exactly! So I'm delighted that I got to play the knight!
Mona: Why does the Prinzessin enjoy the theater so much?
Leon: Her Highness once said, "Celebrate me by staging a play in the wilderness. Bow down to me, and bring me beautiful dreams in return for everlasting glory within the eternal darkness."
Leon: I believe it is because Her Highness appreciates true art, and can also sense emotions hidden deep within the souls of humankind.
Leon: The crystallization and sublime expression of emotion is the heart of theater. People who truly understand theater always have a beautiful, sensitive heart, filled with a rich array of emotion.
Mona: ...So that's how it is.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Thank you for your answer, Sir Knight.
Leon: O—Oh! Th—Thank you so much for calling me a knight!
Leon: So, basking still in this honor, I will be off to my battleground. May we meet again!
Paimon: Hopefully not... Be more careful in the future!
Leon: Oh, and please remember the password to unlock the gate, "Upon my command, spread your wings and take flight."

## Talk 5

Paimon: We're back again.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I believe we have just witnessed the true nature of the wicked dragon.
Xinyan: *sigh* This is something I am all too familiar with. There are always people who believe that our passions are a waste of time.
Mona: Huh? You're—
Arnold: Ask-Me-For-Directions Arnold.
Mona: I mean, you're back, why?
Arnold: Oh, I came because I bet you'd be looking for the third volume of "Hymn of the Holy Land."
Mona: Well, you bet right on that front...
Arnold: You need not do anything for me, my dear lady. The opportunity to behold your beauty is the finest reward I could ask for. I shall give you the answer you seek.
Arnold: The third volume of "Hymn of the Holy Land" can be found on the top floor of the royal castle.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Is it guarded by anyone?
Arnold: Oh, oh, but of course, sir. What sort of a question is that? No nation would treat its most treasured books as if they were just cast out into the wilderness.
Kaedehara Kazuha: That means we will still find Nachtraben guards stationed there.
Arnold: It is a citizen's utmost honor to guard the sacred scriptures. But it matters not. I'm quite sure the fine lady merely seeks to peruse them, and has no malicious intentions.
Arnold: Your face is captivating and full of wisdom, and the company you keep appears to be heroes of some renown. I have the utmost faith that you will be able to comprehend the meaning behind the stories in our sacred scriptures.
Arnold: Her Highness's accomplishments were documented by Oz, the Great Sekretär, and became great treasures of the Immernachtreich. I wish Her Highness joy and happiness every time I read those books.
