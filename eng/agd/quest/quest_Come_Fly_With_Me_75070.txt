# Come Fly With Me


## Talk 1

Magnifico: Haha! I knew we'd meet again! Your timing is impeccable, too — you are about to witness my second masterpiece!
Magnifico: Hmm... Maybe not the second. I do have a ton of fine works, don't I...
Magnifico: Either way, you're most fortunate, for you shall witness me attempt dynamic photography for the first time!
Magnifico: After all, the photos I used to take were all those of victims at crime scenes... Uh, never mind. That does not bear going into detail about...
Paimon: So, do you need our help again this time, Mr. Magnifico?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr?
Magnifico: No, no, certainly n... Hmm, on second thoughts, that would be marvelous! Come, let me explain the situation to you.
Magnifico: So, here's the situation. I need to take photos of a Qucusaurus diving toward the water's surface at this waterfall. We want to catch that most impactful of frames, just as it plunges right down to the surface!
Magnifico: I've hidden food that can attract Qucusaurs in the pond beneath the waterfall. It's just that... *sigh* Well, they haven't come down at the right angle yet.
Paimon: Hmm? Hang on. What's that big circle there on the water's surface?
Magnifico: I wouldn't worry too much about it, though I'm not too sure what it is... It's just some junk I picked up from a nearby tribe to use as a target.
Magnifico: *sigh* All the scrap photos I've taken so far are utterly mundane, so much so that it's annoying. I could keep waiting, but since you're here...
Magnifico: Perhaps you could... uh, guide them? Teach them how to perform a most lovely dive? I mean, you are a Saurian tamer famed throughout Natlan, are you not?
Magnifico: Alright? Great! I'll send a signal out from here. So long as you can get to the precise location of the target by the water when I count down to "one," we're all set!
Traveler: We can give it a go.
Magnifico: Haha, excellent! Let's give it a try, then!
Traveler: We can't guarantee success...
Paimon: That's fine. If we fail, all we've lost is time. And we're travelers — no one's time is worth less than ours.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: ?

## Talk 2

Magnifico: What's up? Are those little ones refusing to listen to you as well?

## Talk 3

Magnifico: *sigh* As you can see, the results are... not ideal. As the deeds, so the man — unsuccessful both!
Magnifico: Ah... My family always told me that even small trees can cast huge shadows... But it's nonsense! Nonsense! They only meant to humiliate me, surely!
Magnifico: Ugh...
Paimon: Hey, hey, don't get mad! You're not going to get any bigger even if you do!
Traveler: Don't give up...
Magnifico: Give up? Who says I'm giving up? Nay! Anger and shame only drive me on, give me strength — that is their purpose! We continue!
Paimon: Well, he's sure fired up... Still a pretty weird guy, though.
Magnifico: Yes, yes.
Traveler: Let's give this another go.
Magnifico: Yes, let's!
Paimon: Whoa, you sure recover fast!

## Talk 4

Magnifico: Gah, we must start over! ...Uh, if you don't mind, I mean.
Paimon: *sigh* There's no "mind" or "don't mind." We're already here, aren't we?
Traveler: Let's continue, then.
Magnifico: You have my thanks.
Traveler: Let's take a break first...
Paimon: That's right. Jumping off cliffs is hard work, y'know?
Magnifico: Ah... Yes. I did not consider that. Alright, just start whenever you're ready. I will wait for you here.

## Talk 5

Magnifico: Haha! Perfect! Here, have a copy!
Paimon: Wow, that *is* amazing!
Magnifico: Here's your compensation. This is the second... No, the third time you've aided me. If not for you... Why, I doubt I'd have a chance of finishing my photo-taking trip at all!
Magnifico: My destination is... Here. I've marked it out on your map. Again, if you're interested, I look forward to working with you again.
Magnifico: Ah! It's almost time. I've got to go now. See you, and good luck!
Black Screen Text: Magnifico finishes packing and hops happily up into his hot-air balloon.
As the balloon slowly disappears, his boisterous laughter is reduced to a distant echo...
