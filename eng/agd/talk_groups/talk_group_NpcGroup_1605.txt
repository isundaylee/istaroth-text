Traveler: How's your work coming along?
Ellin: Oh, you mean the love poem I'm writing for Master Jean! I—I'm still working on it!
Ellin: Professor Venti was teaching us tricks for writing love poems, yes, but what I'd like to express is more like admiration and yearning.
Ellin: I did write a poem, but I haven't had the time to send it to the Professor just yet... Would you like to hear it?
Traveler: Lay it on me.
Ellin: "Your earnest profile working
Like the moon in the night sky gleaming
It leads me into restful dreaming"
Ellin: How is it? Will it do?
Traveler: I can feel your sincerity!
Ellin: Really? That's great! That's exactly what I'd like to express!
Ellin: Thank you! I'll make a few more improvements, and then I'll hand it in.
Traveler: Very passionate indeed...

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Ellin: It's just as I thought. Even Stormterror couldn't stand against Master Jean!
Ellin: Even though Jean said that that traveler was a big help to her, I'm sure she was just being modest. She must've done the lion's share of the work!
Ellin: If only I could have fought alongside Master Jean! We would have vanquished Stormterror together, and then, at the award ceremony, she would have looked at me with a smile on her lips...
Ellin: Just thinking about it makes my heart soar...
Ellin: Yes, I must take this chance and train hard before the next crisis comes...

### Talk 7 related talk 3

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Ellin: It's very scary, but I'm actually not all that worried.
Ellin: I believe that Master Jean will protect us, and all of Mondstadt!
Ellin: *sigh* If only I too were a member of the Knights. I do wish that I could fight alongside Master Jean...

### Talk 7 related talk 4

Traveler: What sword style is that?
Ellin: Oh... I'm copying Master Jean's technique.
Ellin: Every time she wields her sword... You just know it's a Grand Master at work.
Ellin: Only those of great character can use a sword fighting style like that, right?
Ellin: It seems like I can't just focus on power training. I need to start building character, too!

### Talk 7 related talk 5

Traveler: So you're with the Knights of Favonius?
Ellin: Who, me? You think I have what it takes? Really!?
Ellin: Yay, woohoo! My training must really be working after all.
Ellin: Actually I'm not a knight yet, but I'm confident I will make it through the tryouts.
Ellin: Then I'm gonna climb the ranks to captain, then get promoted to Master Jean's second-in-command, and when Jean gets to retirement age, she will shake my hand and say...
Ellin: ...Whoops, I'm getting ahead of myself! Anyway, watch this space 'cause I'm gonna outdo my feckless father by a long way, that's for sure!

### Talk 7 related talk 6

Ellin: Oh it's no problem. I'm going to carry on with sword practice now, so keep your distance.
