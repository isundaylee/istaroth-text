# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Run into anything fun?
Little Kuang: In a lot of ways!
Little Kuang: For example, there are absolutely huge goats in the village to the south, ten times larger than the goats in any book!
Little Kuang: While floating over on a bamboo raft, I saw a jade ornament the size of a mountain... A jade ring? A jade pendant? What was it again...
Little Kuang: Whatever! Forget it! I'll figure it out one day.
Little Kuang: A girl fishing by the waterfall said there's a type of Carp in Chenyu Vale that bestows good luck upon those who see it! I wanna find one!
Little Kuang: The most interesting is the Wushou Dance that Dip Yeuk and his friends are doing! They're like big cats with painted faces nimbly jumping up and down!
Little Kuang: Anyway... Everything here is so novel! So many things here I've never seen or heard of before!
