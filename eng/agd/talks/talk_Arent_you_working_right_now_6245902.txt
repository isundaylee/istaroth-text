# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Aren't you working right now?
Zexuan: Oh! I wasn't talking about myself. I was referring to the Golden House...
Zexuan: The Golden House's Mora production has already stopped for some time now. There are still mountains of Mora inside, but we no longer hear that crisp, clattering sound.
Zexuan: I applied for a transfer here just so I could hear the wonderful sound of raining money. Didn't think I'd be this unfortunate...
Zexuan: Eh? That's weird, you say? Well, even if that money isn't mine, I get a real rush from deep inside my soul whenever I listen to those clinking sounds... I mean, don't you?
