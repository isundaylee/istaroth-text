Baret: Ugh... I really screwed up...

## Talk

Traveler: Oh? How so?
Baret: Before I set off for Natlan, I was warned that the nation has a hot climate, and I should dress light.
Baret: But who'd have thought it would be so hot over here at the People of the Springs that even my lightest dress is still not enough?

Traveler: I wish you luck.
Baret: Huh? Oh, it's fine. I've already pretty much solved the problem.

Traveler: Not going to buy new ones?
Baret: Of course I'll get them! And I'll get as many as I want.
Baret: I've already commissioned a swimsuit in the latest style, and I've bought some limited edition designer skateboards as well.
Baret: Given it's tailored, though, the swimsuit will take some time to make, so I've got to wait a while. It's fine, though â€” chilling here and listening to music isn't a bad way to pass the time.
Baret: Everything here from the people to the music are so laid-back and carefree. I think this suits me better than mainstream rock music.
