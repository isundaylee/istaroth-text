Uncle Tian: Hello there, youngster. Here to enjoy the Moonchase Festival?
Uncle Tian: Back in the day, we would eat Wangxiao Cakes, drink Laurel Wine, and gather together with family and friends to share our hopes for the future.
Uncle Tian: Nowadays, the number dishes to be had has grown and grown, and we aren't quite as particular as we once were â€” we simply eat whatever we wish.
Uncle Tian: Take the opportunity to try some more of Liyue's delicacies, eh?
