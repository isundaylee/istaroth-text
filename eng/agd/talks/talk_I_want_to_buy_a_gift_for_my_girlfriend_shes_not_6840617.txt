Message: "I want to buy a gift for my girlfriend, she's not from Fontaine. Should I get her a clockwork transformer toy, or maybe a magical box of tricks?"
Reply: "Why not buy something like perfume or watches or anything like that?"
Message: "Those only have a single function, they're so boring! Check out this clockwork toy, it can turn into an aquabus! Totally rad!"
Reply: "Unless it can turn into a shield to protect you, I recommend you buy some perfume instead..."
