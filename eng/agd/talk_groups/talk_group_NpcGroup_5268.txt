Guijarro: ...This cat... Of course, that has to be it! Great, I just knew it!
Traveler: Guijarro?
Guijarro: #Huh? Traveler, Paimon, imagine running into you here! What're you doing in Qiaoying Village?
Paimon: Have you... finished writing your book? You wouldn't still happen to be imagining weird things, would you?
Traveler: Or having symptoms of paranoia?
Guijarro: Oh, no, no! I've already finished writing that book. Right now, it's just a matter of waiting for "The Courtcraft of Fontaine" to get printed and go on sale.
Paimon: Wow, Paimon's hooked just hearing the title! What's the book about?
Guijarro: Let's see... it's about a cowardly detective and his fearless little sister, who's also acting as his assistant. They come across a "Crime Museum," which hosts within it the evidence for countless crimes...
Guijarro: Throughout the story, they also encounter missing twins, a meka puppet that cries, and a museum curator who's been drowned in his fountain... and in the end, they find out that the prime suspect is none other than a child who just turned three years old!
Traveler: Okay, enough of that! I'm getting chills!
Guijarro: Hahaha! Once it officially goes on sale, I'll send you both autographed copies.
Paimon: Score! But... Paimon might be too scared to read it on her own...
Paimon: #It's decided then! Traveler, please read it to Paimon!
Traveler: I—I'm also too scared...
Paimon: Really...? Then it looks like our only choice is to read it together!
Guijarro: Come on, you two. No need to ham it up like that. It's just a crime novel, not a horror story.
Guijarro: As for something truly terrifying... I plan on writing a new novel. I've already made a rough outline, and I've been looking everywhere for new material to use as inspiration for the details.
Guijarro: ...Hey, don't look at me like that! This time, all I want to do is combine the crime novel with some local folk tales. Even if we're collecting reference materials, there's no way I'll be all paranoid and jumpy like before.
Traveler: Why not do this in Fontaine?
Guijarro: Ah, well... You see, many people have already written about Fontainian folklore, and I want to write something... a bit more original!
Guijarro: It also just so happened that a friend of mine was planning to come here to check out the tea business, so I tagged along.
Guijarro: No sooner had I stepped off the boat than I discovered some truly stellar subject matter! Just as I was considering how to best pursue the matter, you two came over.
Guijarro: To borrow the local Liyue lingo, this would be... uh, um... "destined to meet, though originally separated by more than a thousand miles"?
Traveler: Already adapting to the local culture, I see...
Paimon: How should Paimon put it... Well, maybe it's no wonder you're a great writer? You're so quick when it comes to understanding the local customs...
Paimon: But did you just say you've already found something? There's nothing here!
Guijarro: Says who? Look! Do you not see this cat?
Traveler: Seen it from the start! But what's so strange about a cat?
Confused Kitty: Meow...? Meeeow...
Guijarro: Ah, you must be unaware. In the legends of Qiaoying Village, there are strange beasts known as "Xuanwen Beasts."
Guijarro: According to the legends, these strange beasts appear like young cats and can sense good and evil, concealing themselves at night and rising with the sun, eating... uh... eating the wind and drinking the dew, crossing a thousand miles in a day, and gnawing tea trees at night to nourish themselves...
Guijarro: Anyway! That's what the article in "Bedazzled!" said, at least!
Traveler: You can tell from the name it's a load of tripe!
Paimon: Feels like whoever wrote that... All they heard was the name "Xuanwen beast," and they just tossed every weird rumor they'd ever heard into a pot and started stirring!
Guijarro: Still, based on my own investigations, there are indeed "Xuanwen beasts" near Qiaoying Village, even if I'm still a bit fuzzy on the details... But as long as they exist, then I can study and use them!
Paimon: Wow! Guijarro's completely different from before. She used to be so scared and timid...
Traveler: And now, she came all the way here with nothing but a name to go on...
Guijarro: Hahaha! Apologies! It's one of my faults. As soon as I start writing, I'll find myself drawn into the same mindset as the book's characters.
Guijarro: The protagonist of this book is a super-confident detective! So self-assured that you could say they consider everyone else to be beneath them...
Guijarro: Alrighty! That's enough blah-blah for now. I need to carefully research this little...
Black Screen Text: The cat turns and flees like lightning...
Guijarro: Whoa! It ran away, after it!
Black Screen Text: Without another word, Guijarro breaks into a run, sprinting after the cat at breakneck speed...
Paimon: Not again! We've gotta catch up to her quickly, or who knows what kind of wacky hijinks Guijarro will get up to this time!
Paimon: Guijarro! Not so fast!
Traveler: Where did you dig up a tabloid like that?
Traveler: Unless... it isn't a cat, and is instead...?
Guijarro: You think so too!? I knew it, haha, great minds always think alike!
Paimon: Nononono! Not at all! No matter what, it looks like it's just an ordinary little kitty!
Traveler: You came all the way to Qiaoying Village just to get some reference material...
Guijarro: After all, Fontaine's folk tales have been written to death! I just want to write something original.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Paimon: Yeah! You're the best.
Traveler: Sounds like quite the case...
Traveler: We're not in Fontaine anymore. You're quite a ways from home.
Traveler: Is there... something wrong with this cat?
Guijarro: #Ah, I believe it is... Eh? Huh? Traveler, Paimon, imagine running into you here! What are you doing in Qiaoying Village?

## Talk

Guijarro: It can't be... It can't be...
Traveler: What are you doing?
Guijarro: Ah! No! I swear I didn't do anything, please don't hurt me!
Paimon: What are you talking about? Why would we want to hurt you?
Guijarro: I don't know! But I also don't know that you won't really hurt me!
Traveler: You're not making any sense...
Guijarro: Oh! ...I've got it! It must be because I discovered your secret, right?
Guijarro: I... I took the newspaper with your secret letter hidden inside it in the coffee shop?
Guijarro: Or because I accidentally discovered your passphrase? Wait a moment, could it be that the fish I ate last night...
Guijarro: I say, the reason that the fish had so few bones is because you already deboned that fish!
Guijarro: Yes, yes, you wish to use the difference in the number of bones in each fish to send a message... But I accidentally bought this one and brought it back home with me...
Paimon: What the heck is this girl talking about? Paimon can't make heads or tails of it...
Traveler: I won't hurt you.
Guijarro: Y—You really aren't out to hurt me?
Paimon: What's with you!? We've only just met you, why would we want to hurt you?
Guijarro: R—Really? I'm... I'm glad. And I'm really sorry, how embarrassing...
Guijarro: I've been working hard on a detective novel recently, but I still don't know what methodology the criminal should use to commit their crime!
Guijarro: And because I am always overthinking things, so... Now when I look at anything, my first reaction is to consider how it could be used to... you know, commit crimes.
Guijarro: *sigh* That's why I was... so nervous just now. I truly am sorry. Maybe I have become what they call "paranoid" now.
Guijarro: I was about to ride the aquabus into the city for a cup of coffee, but when I saw aquabus running...
Guijarro: I... I immediately saw countless possibilities, all the ways I could be killed on an aquabus! I simply didn't dare to board.
Traveler: You said yourself it was only paranoia.
Guijarro: That may be so. But I simply cannot stop thinking about it, and the more I think, the more afraid I become...
Traveler: I'll accompany you...
Guijarro: Really!? Amazing, but... What if the people who want to hurt me hurt you too?
Traveler: You just try to relax...
Paimon: #Come on, come on! Stop overthinking it. No matter what the problem is, Traveler can handle it, easy peasy!
Traveler: I'll escort you there.
Traveler: There's no way that'd happen, stop overthinking it.
Traveler: Don't be so paranoid.
Traveler: What are you talking about?
