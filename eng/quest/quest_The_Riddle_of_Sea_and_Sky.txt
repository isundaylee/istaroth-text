# The Riddle of Sea and Sky


## Talk 1

Mualani: Okay, this is the place.
Paimon: So, where do we go next?
Mualani: I'm not completely sure yet. The map seems to indicate there's a mechanism here that crosses the water, but I still need to think about what these lines might be referring to...
Viramdra: I knew it! My theory was correct!
Paimon: Sounds like he's got something to say again.
Mualani: If you have any suggestions, then please feel free to share.
Viramdra: I believe the mechanism that the lines are indicating is a Spiritway.
Mualani: Hmm, that is a possibility, but I don't remember anyone from the tribe setting up a Spiritdoor around here.
Viramdra: According to my theory, it might not have been set up by humans. The dragons living in Natlan also used a similar device, long before the humans.
Viramdra: Speaking of which, the Spiritdoors your tribe uses may have been built imitating the dragon ones.
Mualani: I remember now! Uncle Nuu did mention this possibility to me before...
Viramdra: After learning about the legend, I realized that it was connected to my research, and so, I looked up a lot of related information.
Viramdra: Even though I haven't found an exact route to the mysterious island, I'm fairly certain I've deduced the geographical features of the island's surrounding areas.
Viramdra: Firstly, it's at an intersection between water and land, and secondly, there should be a high concentration of Phlogiston. My research indicates that the Spiritway was originally a natural phenomenon caused by the flow of Phlogiston.
Viramdra: Therefore, the area must contain many potential Spiritways, and the dragons who lived here in ancient times may have left behind some devices to control them.
Mualani: Ah... amazing! Now it all makes sense!
Paimon: Now everyone's contributing to the team!
Viramdra: Ahem... You flatter me. If my theory is correct, we should already be very close to the mysterious island. Once you've unlocked the mechanism, we'll be able to derive the island's location.
Mualani: Alright, then let's start searching for the dragons' Spiritdoor!
Viramdra: That's just a quick and easy name... I won't be able to include it in my thesis. Given the dragons used the device long before the humans, we should stick with a name that references no human concepts. Calling it a "Phlogiston Node" would be much more appropriate.
Mualani: ...Uh, then let's start searching for the Phlogiston Node! Speaking of which, what is it, exactly?
Viramdra: If I'm not mistaken... look that way!
Paimon: Whoa, it started glowing! This should be it, right?
Mualani: Looks like we can activate it once we get close enough. The light does remind me of a Spiritway.
Mualani: But according to the map, there should be two more Phlogiston Nodes. Let's keep searching, everyone.

## Talk 2

Karya: I'm so happy Viramdra was able to help the team.

## Talk 3

Mualani: Only those who can trust each other with their lives can reach the mysterious island. Since you two are willing to trust me, then naturally, I'm willing to trust you.
Traveler: Just leave it to us!
Paimon: Alrighty...
Paimon: Please be careful!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Please be careful!

## Talk 5

Viramdra: You're better acquainted with her than I, so you should tell her to carefully reconsider her decision.
Karya: Viramdra is quite knowledgeable about Natlan's geography, so his ideas might also be worth considering. Perhaps you can give it some thought...

## Talk 6

Viramdra: I can't believe there was an error with my theory...
Karya: Is there anything I can help with? I must thank you all for saving Viramdra earlier.

## Talk 7

Mualani: Whew... That was perfect!
Paimon: You're amazing, Mualani! There were a couple moments Paimon thought it was over...
Mualani: Hehe, I'm confident I could do it all over again! Wait, why are the Phlogiston Nodes no longer lit?
Paimon: Oh no, you're right...
Viramdra: It appears the Phlogiston Nodes here need to automatically recharge. Once they're activated, they'll be unusable for some time.
Mualani: In that case, no matter what happens next, we have to seize our chance. Otherwise, who knows how long we'll have to wait for another shot.
Viramdra: Do you hear that...?
Paimon: The weather's getting gloomy... And a bunch of whirlpools just appeared in the water!
Mualani: Yes, we need to get to higher ground and take a look.
Black Screen Text: You make your way up the hill nearby.
Mualani: Hey, look over there!
Paimon: Whoa, there's a giant whirlpool over there!
Mualani: Yep, and that's our next stop...
Paimon: Huh? What do you mean?
Mualani: ...The info I deciphered from the map points to only one possibility... To reach the mysterious island, we must enter that massive whirlpool.
Paimon: No way...
Viramdra: Forgive me for being frank, but as a guide of the People of the Springs, I'm sure you understand of the danger of such a vortex even better than we do.
Mualani: Yes, I know. But whether it's the information deciphered from the map, or the direction of the Spiritway that I observed in the air...
Mualani: Everything points to the path ahead being hidden in that whirlpool!
Viramdra: And what if you're wrong?
Karya: Viramdra...
Paimon: ...
Viramdra: I'm not trying to be unreasonable. Unfortunately, I'm very knowledgeable in this area...
Viramdra: The Spiritways must have affected the nearby bodies of water, and lowered the water level... That's why the whirlpools appeared.
Viramdra: At this rate, some of the land that was once underwater will soon reappear at the surface and see the light of day again... Don't you think that sounds more like the definition of a mysterious island?
Viramdra: So our goal should be the shallow waters. If we enter that vortex, the undercurrents will drag us to the bottomless abyss!
Paimon: Uh... He does seem to have a point.
Mualani: I can't find any evidence to refute your claim for the moment, but I still trust my judgment.
Viramdra: Then it seems like it's time for our collaboration to come to an end.
Paimon: But didn't we all agree to trust each other!?
Viramdra: I have reached this conclusion based on my field of expertise, and I cannot deny it, even if you try to convince me otherwise. From now on, let us each choose our own way.
Mualani: ...No, I refuse!
Viramdra: Yâ€”You...
Mualani: Letting your clients separate themselves from the group in the middle of a journey will result in the worst luck possible! I will not agree to that.
Viramdra: Then we can implement the plan I proposed at the very beginning. You're not my guide, and as such, you don't have to take responsibility for me!
Mualani: Ugh, but you can't do that once you've traveled together as a group! If you were to leave now, we'll all be hit with bad luck. It's now beyond both of our control.
Mualani: How about this... You and Karya wait here. We'll go first and investigate the whirlpool.
Mualani: I know you like to explain everything with theories and logic, so let me build my case first, and then I'll come back to convince you!
Viramdra: Well, uh...
Mualani: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, let's get going!

## Talk 8

Mualani: What do you think? This is a specialty dish I learned to make that's perfect for camping.
Paimon: Mm-hmm, it really hits the spot! You're a great cook, Mualani.
Mualani: Karya helped out quite a bit, so she deserves some credit, too!
Karya: No no, I'm just happy I was able to help out.
Paimon: Huh? What was that sound? Some kind of wild beast? Oh, it's scary to camp out at night...
Mualani: Don't worry. Remember the record player I bought? Let me go turn it on.
Mualani: Listen. It really works, huh?
Paimon: Wow, so it really works? Paimon thought you were just playing it for good luck.
Mualani: My parents told me that most of the valuable experience from our ancestors is hidden in various customs. It's always better to trust our traditions.
Paimon: Huh, guess that makes sense...
Mualani: In a sense, this trip to the mysterious island is also a custom left behind by the first chief of the tribe. I wonder what kind of experience he's trying to share with us.
Traveler: What kind of person was he like?
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon would like to know, too!
Mualani: Even though I've heard my parents tell stories since I was little... I actually don't know too much about him.
Mualani: It's said that he was the first person to make a map of Natlan, and even the first person to become friends with the Koholasaurs.
Paimon: That sounds pretty amazing!
Mualani: Yeah, there isn't a place in Natlan that he didn't visit... even the most remote parts bear his footprints.
Mualani: Even now, no one has even come close to his reputation and status as a guide. His trip to the mysterious island is the most legendary of all his accomplishments.
Mualani: But oddly enough, after returning from the mysterious island, he laid aside his yearning for adventure and chose to settle down. That's how the tribe was founded.
Mualani: It really makes me wonder what the journey meant to him.
Mualani: Hmm? Ahem... A camping trip shouldn't be this stuffy and quiet! Everyone needs to help make it more lively!
Mualani: How about this... before we rest for the night, let's have a bonfire party!
Viramdra: If we're going to go plunging into that whirlpool tomorrow, then wouldn't it be best to try to rest and conserve energy now?
Mualani: Now's not the time to be a party pooper! You ought to agree to ideas from the one who rescued you today!
Paimon: Yeah, she's right!
Viramdra: Alright... So what do the rules stipulate for a bonfire party?
Mualani: Rules? A bonfire doesn't have any rules! Everyone just needs to have a good time. How about this, I'll ask everyone a question, and then we'll take turns saying what's on our mind.
Paimon: Okay, sounds fun enough!
Mualani: So, for the first question... what's the purpose of a journey?
Paimon: Oh, we were just talking about this!
Mualani: Let's hear everyone's ideas, and maybe we can figure out what the first chief was thinking back when he made the trip.
Paimon: Paimon can go first! If you ask Paimon what the purpose of a journey is... it'd definitely be about treasure and all kinds of delicious food! And...
Paimon: Most importantly, it's about making the trip together with your companions!
Mualani: #Yes, I can't agree more! Okay, next person... How about you, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: The purpose of a journey...
Black Screen Text: #You close your eyes and recall the moment you were separated from {M#her}{F#him}...
Black Screen Text: You remember the moment you stepped onto the islands of Inazuma with the falling Sakura petals.
Mualani: You sure are taking your time thinking about it!
Traveler: Hmm, where should I even start?
Mualani: Ah, I get it. You must have passed through many nations before making it to Natlan, right?
Mualani: It's quite possible that your experience traveling is more than what I have as a guide. It's understandable that you can't explain it off the top of your head.
Mualani: Why don't I circle back to you later? You can tell me once you have a clear answer.
Mualani: Next... Let's hear what Karya has to say.
Karya: Me? If you ask about my travels... Well, this is actually my first time traveling, so I don't have anything useful to contribute.
Mualani: That doesn't matter! This is a party around the bonfire, not some research seminar.
Karya: Alright... If I had to say what the meaning of a journey is, I'd say... it provides an opportunity for true companionship.
Karya: Before you reach the destination, you don't need to think about anything outside the trip itself. As long as you stick together with your companions, you won't have any trouble to worry about.
Mualani: Yeah, I get it.
Paimon: Paimon, too!
Karya: Huh? I hope that didn't sound too silly...
Mualani: Ahem! Alright, now it's Viramdra's turn!
Viramdra: Alright, if you insist...
Viramdra: In my opinion, our goals and dreams in life are all in pursuit of what we call "results." The so-called "journey" is but a path that leads to these results.
Viramdra: So, the greatest meaning of a journey lies in managing to find the right result.
Mualani: Not sure I completely get what you mean...
Viramdra: There's nothing difficult to understand. It's the same as the decision of your first chief.
Viramdra: He must have discovered enough valuable results after visiting the mysterious island to decide that he should end his journey. Once you've achieved the results you want, any additional journeys would become all but meaningless.
Mualani: Um...
Viramdra: Before coming here, someone had stolen the "results" of one of my research projects.
Viramdra: All that person had to do was sign his name on my achievements, and he was able to take all of the honors. All my effort vanished into the air as though it never existed.
Viramdra: Do you understand now, Miss Guide? Without results, the journey is meaningless.
Mualani: I sympathize with your situation, but I'm afraid I can't agree with your take.
Viramdra: I don't need your sympathy. As long as I can reach the mysterious island and find the correct results, my pain and struggles will become just another insignificant part of the process.
Viramdra: What happened during the day already proved that my theories were wrong, so I'm willing to trust your judgment. I apologize for our previous argument.
Viramdra: I must make it to the mysterious island, and if I have to entrust my life to someone else to achieve that goal, then so be it!
Paimon: Was that actually supposed to be an apology, 'cause it sounded kinda awkward...
Mualani: Actually, there's a saying among the guides of the People of the Springs... If the goal of the journey was to reach the destination, then you should have never left the house to begin with.
Mualani: Because the final destination of every journey is your home.
Mualani: It would be disrespectful of my duties as a guide if I were just taking tourists straight to where they wanted to go. It's my hope to also make everyone feel happy along the way to their destination!
Mualani: That is what I would truly call a journey, and that is my answer.
Viramdra: Just as you don't agree with me, I can't agree with your point of view, either.
Mualani: I'm not too worried about that. After all, another purpose of traveling is to help people understand each other better.
Viramdra: What sort of logic is that...?
Mualani: Alright, that's it for this round. Since it's still early, how about we tell some horror stories next?
Paimon: Huh!? Oh, now Paimon's scared...

## Talk 9

Paimon: Whew... We finally found all of them!
Mualani: Great work, everyone! Okay, now, first, we need to figure out how to control this thing. Hmm... Its qualities are very similar to that of a man-made device, but it doesn't seem as intuitive to me...
Paimon: Is there something wrong?
Mualani: See, look at this... After activating a normal Spiritdoor, we could just go ahead and use it. But this one requires someone to stay and keep operating it here.
Mualani: Also, according to the map, we need to activate the mechanism and switch between different Phlogiston Nodes to change the path of the Spiritway.
Mualani: If we don't operate the nodes properly, then the people on the Spiritway will come tumbling from the sky.
Paimon: Isn't that super dangerous?
Viramdra: In theory, the process should be very safe, but only if the three Phlogiston Nodes are each being operated by someone.
Mualani: Do you think you'd be able to operate it? I just tried, and it clearly requires more skill than a typical Spiritdoor.
Viramdra: Though I've never tried before, I've read a lot of information and theoretically should be able to properly control it. Let me give it a try...
Viramdra: ...Huh? But in theory, this shouldn't happen.
Karya: If Viramdra can't control it, then that also rules out me...
Mualani: Okay... Well, how about you?
Paimon: #After all the adventures {NICKNAME}'s been on, handling something like this should be easy-peasy!
Mualani: #Alright, then it'll be up to {NICKNAME} to stay here and operate the Phlogiston Node. I'll go activate the mechanism.
Mualani: I'll let you know when we need to switch nodes. Just make sure you quickly head to the corresponding node and we should make it safely!
Paimon: Wait! But handling it this way sounds even more dangerous, Mualani.
Mualani: Don't worry, it looks like the Spiritways are all above the water. I'm pretty good at swimming, so I'm not afraid if I end up falling in!
Paimon: But it's so high, and you'll be falling so fast... If we don't manage to reach a node in time, or if we make a mistake, there's a lot that can happen...
Mualani: Do you still remember the promise we made before we left, Paimon?
Mualani: Only those who can trust each other with their lives can reach the mysterious island. Since you two are willing to trust me, then naturally, I'm willing to trust you.
Paimon: Alrighty...
Traveler: Just leave it to us!
Paimon: Please be careful!

## Talk 10

Paimon: Why did this have to happen now... Can we still make it into the whirlpool?
Mualani: No need to hesitate. I'll get in the water and rescue him, just tell me which way he went, Karya!

## Talk 11

Paimon: Whoa, the massive whirlpool is up ahead. Just the thought of going in there is making Paimon dizzy...
Mualani: Do you also think that this is a reckless decision?
Paimon: Um, well...
Mualani: It's okay, that's completely normal. Actually, I completely understand how Viramdra feels.
Mualani: This is just how it is to be a guide. The tribe's experiences passed down from generation to generation is what gives us the ability to guide our guests through hardships.
Mualani: This gives us the power to decide which way we should go, but it also means that we must bear the consequences of our mistakes in judgment. Which could be quite dire this time...
Mualani: Although I'm pretty convinced that all the leads we have collected are pointing us to the whirlpool, I still don't know what awaits us inside.
Mualani: If the scholars still choose to reject my plan, I won't have the confidence to ask them to only do as I say.
Mualani: The same goes for the two of you. You are the commissioners, so if you think this is too risky, then it's perfectly reasonable if you want to end the trip here...
Mualani: The good news is that I know the way back to the tribe very well!
Paimon: Mualani...
Traveler: We've already made a promise to each other.
Mualani: #{NICKNAME}...
Paimon: That's right! You've trusted us before, Mualani. Now it's our turn to trust you.
Paimon: Besides, it's gonna take more than a whirlpool to scare the two of us! We all managed to make it back from the Night Kingdom. After an experience like that, what's so scary about being sucked into a whirlpool?
Mualani: Aw, Paimon... C'mon, bring it in again!
Paimon: Alright, alright... Let's investigate this whirlpool and see if we can gather any info to convince that scholar.
Paimon: Matters of luck aside, he definitely knows a lot about geography. We'll need him on the team.
Mualani: I know, it's just that we can't see much from here... I'll get closer to the water and have another look.
Paimon: Wait a sec... Is it just Paimon, or does the whirlpool seem to be getting smaller?
Mualani: You're right... Maybe it's just like the Phlogiston Nodes and can only be active for a certain amount of time?
Paimon: That means we need to hurry!
Karya: Miss Guide, we have a problem!
Mualani: Karya? What are you doing here?
Karya: I tried to persuade him, but Viramdra insisted on verifying his theory first.
Karya: He said that the water to the south was about to be shallow enough to wade through. But after he took a few steps, the water suddenly began to surge, and he was swept away.
Karya: I'm not much of a swimmer, so I came to call for help.
Paimon: Why did this have to happen now... Can we still make it into the whirlpool?
Mualani: No need to hesitate. I'll get in the water and rescue him, just tell me which way he went, Karya!
Traveler: We'll reach the island together.

## Talk 12

Viramdra: Now, how to control the Phlogiston Nodes... Let me reflect on the information I read.

## Talk 13

Viramdra: *coughing* *spluttering*
Mualani: Whew... Karya came and found us just in time.
Paimon: Oh, there they are!
Karya: Viramdra... thank goodness you're alright. Thank you so much, Miss Guide.
Mualani: Ugh, didn't I tell you to wait for me?
Viramdra: *cough* Judging by the changes in the water's surface, the path to the mysterious island wouldn't be around for long! I didn't want to miss this opportunity!
Viramdra: It's just... I didn't expect my calculations to be wrong. It seems you were right...
Paimon: Right, who knows if we can make it back in time now... Huh? The whirlpools have disappeared!
Mualani: Seems we missed our chance...
Viramdra: Why would you give up on such an opportunity to come rescue me?
Mualani: How can you say that? It's already bad enough that you had to be left behind. Do you think I'd let anyone in my group drown?
Viramdra: ...
Karya: I'm really sorry...
Mualani: Don't feel guilty, Karya. I think if I reactivate the nodes, that will cause the whirlpools to reappear.
Mualani: The only problem is that we still don't know exactly when we'll be able to do that...
Mualani: It's already getting late now, and we've been on the move for the whole day. As your guide, I suggest we make camp first and have a good meal. We can talk about the other stuff tomorrow.
Paimon: Now that you mention it, Paimon is feeling a little hungry...
Traveler: It's a miracle she hasn't mentioned food for so long...
Paimon: Hey, Paimon's stomach can be very sensible. It won't interrupt while everyone's busy solving puzzles.
Mualani: We have plenty of tasty things to eat, let's just find a suitable spot to make camp. Hmm... I like that place right over there.
Black Screen Text: Mualani guides everyone to the best place to make camp.
Paimon: #Is this the spot? Let Paimon and {NICKNAME} help set up the tent!
Mualani: Go ahead! I'll take care of the fire. And here's a little camping tip, it's best to set the tent upwind from the campfire!
