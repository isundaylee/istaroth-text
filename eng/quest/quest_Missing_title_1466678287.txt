Arataki Itto: That's it, I wanna take another look. And this time, I, Arataki "The One and Oni," will...
Kuki Shinobu: Boss.
Arataki Itto: Whoa! What's up, sourpuss?
Kuki Shinobu: Time for some Roasted Lavender Melon.
Arataki Itto: Huh? We're trapped in a life and death situation underground, and you're telling me it's time for Roasted Lavender Melon?
Ushi: Moo, moo.
Arataki Itto: Interesting, you hear that? Ushi says you're completely right... Wait, hold on, whose side are you on, Beefcake?
Ushi: Moo...
Kuki Shinobu: It's important to stay replenished. We must keep our energy and morale up in preparation for facing the unknown.
Kuki Shinobu: Even Ushi knows that.
Arataki Itto: Fine, you two... Hey are you already eating?
Arataki Itto: Hold on, is it still warm? Oh, that does smell good... Mmm...
Arataki Itto: Fine, yeah, we'll have a quick snack and then we'll keep looking for a way out. Hey, don't eat them all, leave a couple for me!
