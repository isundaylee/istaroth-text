Traveler: A prescription?
Herbalist Gui: Medicine can both help and harm. The key lies in the amount used.
Herbalist Gui: Use too little, and it has no effect. Use too much, and you could hurt yourself. A balance must be struck in order to heal.
Herbalist Gui: I have yet to finish my training, so I cannot simply take what ingredients I will.
Herbalist Gui: ...Regardless of whether this is about healing the sick, or simply about Master Baizhu and Bubu Pharmacy's good name, I cannot be careless about such things.
Traveler: I'd like to know about Bubu Pharmacy...
Herbalist Gui: As you've seen, this is the best pharmacy in Liyue. Thanks to Dr. Baizhu's extraordinary skills, we have an endless stream of customers who come to seek cures and get herbs every single day.
Herbalist Gui: Dr. Baizhu himself has a poor constitution, so the job of putting the medicines together falls to me, while Qiqi handles herb-picking...
Herbalist Gui: ...But as to what illness Dr. Baizhu has, I have no clue.
Herbalist Gui: He's been ill from the very first time I met him, and hasn't completely recovered since.
Herbalist Gui: Perhaps, it is as they say â€” "a physician cannot cure himself."
