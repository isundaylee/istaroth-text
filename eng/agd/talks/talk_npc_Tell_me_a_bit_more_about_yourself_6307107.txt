Traveler: Tell me a bit more about yourself...
Li Xiao: I grew up in Liyue Harbor. I left my home because I wanted to see the other cities. I joined a caravan and started doing business everywhere.
Li Xiao: It has been almost a decade since I left. Although I did make some progress in my career, I also feel more and more guilty... To everyone else, I must be a really unfilial son.
Li Xiao: Now that I've finally returned home after being stuck in Inazuma for all this time, I've had some time to think things over.
Li Xiao: I've decided to only do business in Liyue for the time being. I might earn less, but I'll be able to spend more time with my family.
