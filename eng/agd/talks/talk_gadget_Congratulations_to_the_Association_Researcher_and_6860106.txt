Association Announcement: "Congratulations to the Association Researcher and part-time Courier Hoa for successfully excavating an ancient Qucusaurus dragon object!"
Association Announcement: "Based on our analysis, the ancient dragon object she found was a saddle used by the people on the territory of the Flower-Feather Clan to stay firmly secured on their Qucusaurus mounts while diving."
Message from the Involved Party: "I just accidentally tripped and fell while delivering a letter, straight up cratered. I only found it because it was the thing I tripped over..."
Message from the Involved Party: "Are you sure it isn't just... something some Qucusaur Rider lost recently?"
Association Reply: "Please trust the Association's judgment, as well as the instruments used to determine the age of the ancient dragon object..."
Association Announcement: "In addition, even if this was equipment lost by some Rider... Just how badly would the Knight and Qucusaur have had to fall to bury the saddle that deep?"
Message from the Involved Party: "So was my fall not bad enough then? I remember the Association's rules. Researchers must be compensated for work-related injuries..."
Message from the Involved Party: "Where's my Mora!"
