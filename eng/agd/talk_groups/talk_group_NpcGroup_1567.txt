Timmie: ...What're you doing! You're scaring the pigeons away!

Traveler: There's not much I can do about it now...
Timmie: Not much you can do? Hmph. Yeah, right!
Timmie: Mommy says that as long as you love the world, no animals will be scared of you!
Timmie: Otherwise, why do you think the pigeons aren't scared of me?

Traveler: They'll be back.
Timmie: They do come back usually... But what happens if one day they leave and never come back again?
Timmie: Just like Daddy...

Traveler: Goodbye.
Timmie: Wah... I'm telling Mommy on you!

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Timmie: I'm thinking that Stormterror must be... a transformed flock of pigeons.
Timmie: People like you always scare them, so they turned into a dragon to get their revenge!
Timmie: But they definitely wouldn't hurt someone who's always been nice to them, like me... would they?
