Arataki Itto: Ah, compadre! A little birdie told me you went to Aisa Bathhouse last night!
Arataki Itto: I'm gettin' the crew together, and we're gonna go there to celebrate! You in?
Paimon: But, we were just there...
Arataki Itto: Uh, yeah... But, I bet you were missin' a few people, yeah? Like Shinobu.. and Gorou... and, y'know... Ayato...
Kuki Shinobu: Basically, Boss heard about the trip, and now he really wants to go.
Arataki Itto: A—Anyway! Once you're done perusin', come find me, and we'll SOAK! IT! UP!

Arataki Itto: Well? Ready to get your soak on?

## Talk 3

Black Screen Text: Following Itto's constant nagging, you all head to Aisa Bathhouse once again...
Arataki Itto: Hahaha! This has gotta be the hottest one! Let's see who can last the longest! Who's in?
Thoma: Hehe, if you're that excited about it, how can I refuse?
Kuki Shinobu: Listen... This isn't a sauna...
Sayu: Ahhh... so warm... *snore*
Paimon: Hey, don't fall asleep in the tub!
Gorou: Uh... My fur is so heavy. I almost feel dizzy...
Arataki Itto: Hahaha! If you can't handle the heat, Gorou, get out of the... tub!
Kujou Sara: Hey! Stop being so loud!
Black Screen Text: On the other side...
Kamisato Ayato: Heh, Itto is as energetic as ever.
Kamisato Ayaka: It's not good to get distracted during a match, brother.
Yoimiya: #Whoa! This game is getting heated! What's your next move, Traveler? What do you two think?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hm... I would take it slow, try to consolidate my advantage.
Shikanoin Heizou: Or, you could be aggressive... taking a risk isn't a bad idea!
Traveler: (Go slow and steady)
Kamisato Ayato: #Oh? Very clever, Traveler! A decisive defeat... I concede! Now, based on the random draw earlier, the next player should be...
Kamisato Ayato: Ayaka! Have fun, you two.
Kamisato Ayaka: #Oh, uh... Okay! Go easy on me, Traveler...
Traveler: (Ayato must have lost to me on purpose to give Ayaka more time to play... Always up to something, that one...)
Traveler: (Be aggressive!)

## Talk 4

Aikawa Susumu: Boss! The Mikawa Flower Festival was a huge success for us! We had three times more visitors than usual!
Aikawa Susumu: Based on what we've made so far, I think we'll be able to make... this much!
Yumemizuki Mizuki: That's great news! We might even beat Yae Publishing house this month...
Yae Miko: Oh? You look pleased about something... Having a party without me?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Oh, hehe... It's nothing...
Yae Miko: I forgot to share some good news with you...
Yae Miko: Thirty percent of the proceeds from the festival have been transferred to Yae Publishing House. We're expecting record profit this month... Don't you think congratulations are in order?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: What!?
Aikawa Susumu: W—Well, boss... I guess congratulations ARE in order... This is our 333rd time competing against Yae Publishing House in sales, and our best showing to date — second place!
Yae Miko: Hehehe...
Ei: ...May this be a night of sweet dreams for all.
