# Talk Dialog

Traveler: I'd like to book a therapy session.
Hyakujitsuhaku Shion: Really? Now that would be my pleasure!
Hyakujitsuhaku Shion: But I also have to help all these other guests sign in... Hmmm, what would Mizuki do?
Hyakujitsuhaku Shion: I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to wait inside for a short while. I'll be with you as soon as possible!
