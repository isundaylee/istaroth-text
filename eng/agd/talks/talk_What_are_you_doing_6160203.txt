Traveler: What are you doing?
Albert: Nothing, just out for a stroll.
Albert: Because this is the closest I can get to Barbara-sama without disrupting her work at the Cathedral!
Albert: Can you smell the scent of honey in the air?
Albert: ...Um, do you want to join the Barbara Fan Club?
Albert: 'Cause if you do, you're in luck â€” I actually run it! Whether you want to show your support through fan activities or get up-to-date info on performance arrangements, once you're a member you can always find someone to point you in the right direction.
Albert: What do you reckon? Give it some thought!
