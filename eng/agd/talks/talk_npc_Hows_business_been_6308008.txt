Traveler: How's business been?
Vahid: Uh... How should I put this?
Vahid: I originally thought that the Sakoku Decree's abolishing would see business pick up, but it hasn't actually improved all that much.
Vahid: It's always the same few customers coming to purchase fertilizers. They often forget the method of using the fertilizer to boot...
Vahid: Well, by the way, dear customer, would you like some Anahitian Blessing? How about buying it as a souvenir for your journey here?
