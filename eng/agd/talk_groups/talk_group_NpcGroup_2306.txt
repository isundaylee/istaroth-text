Granny Ruoxin: Hello there, Traveler. Welcome to Qingce Village. Have you come to listen to the opera?
Granny Ruoxin: The fireworks from this year's Lantern Rite have been most lively, and everyone here has been in high spirits. I, too, wanted to add something new to the experience this year. So, I invited Yun Jin to perform here in our village.
Granny Ruoxin: Her operas preserve the operatic traditions of Liyue while often coming up with fresh stories. It is truly a new experience each and every time.

Granny Ruoxin: I have this fragment...
Granny Ruoxin: A fragment of...? Found something curious, have you? Let me see...
Granny Ruoxin: Heh... No wonder you can't make head or tail of it. This isn't writing on here — it's a drawing.
Granny Ruoxin: Long, long ago, before writing was invented, people recorded events with pictures.
Granny Ruoxin: Look, this symbol here depicts the Chi — a legendary beast. It looks like the full symbol must have been very large and complex, this is only part of it. But it's enough for me to recognize it by.
Granny Ruoxin: My guess is that this depicts the battle between the Geo Lord and the Chi. But it's hard to be more specific from just this one piece.
Traveler: If you had all the pieces, could you make sense of it?
Granny Ruoxin: Oh, I don't know about that. No guarantee.
Granny Ruoxin: But what I can guarantee is that without all the pieces, I certainly can't make sense of it.
Traveler: Watch me, I'll find the rest in no time.
Granny Ruoxin: Hehe... So much enthusiasm. I like that about young people.
Granny Ruoxin: Given what this fragment is showing, I'd say that if you really want to find the other fragments, here's what you should do...
Granny Ruoxin: According to the legend of the Geo Lord and the Chi, the battle took place at a *great height*. So you could try your luck on the mountaintops around here.
Granny Ruoxin: Beyond that, there are many traces of the battle in this area. *Ruins* would be a sensible place to look.
Granny Ruoxin: In every conflict there is a losing side. The legend tells that after defeating the Chi, the Geo Lord instructed our forebears to erect *Geo Statues* to crush the Chi's remaining power.
Granny Ruoxin: I'd guess you would have a higher chance of finding things to do with the Chi in places with lots of *Geo Statues*.
Granny Ruoxin: For example, there are many *Geo Statues* erected *west* of Qingce Village. It's said that's the very spot where the Geo Lord crushed the Chi... Maybe you'll strike lucky over that way.
Granny Ruoxin: Once you've found all the fragments, bring them to me. I'll be waiting right here.

Granny Ruoxin: ...This is something I never expected to see.
Granny Ruoxin: Well, if it's what fate has decreed...
Traveler: Remind me about the fragments?
Granny Ruoxin: Forgotten already? Well, I do have a habit of rambling on and on I suppose...
Granny Ruoxin: If you're looking for fragments connected to the great war, you may have more luck searching in *high-altitude* places.
Granny Ruoxin: Also, you should head *west* and take a close look nearby the *Geo Statues*.
Granny Ruoxin: Finally, it can't hurt to check the *ruins* in this area.
Traveler: What makes you so sure?
Granny Ruoxin: Hahaha... I never said I was sure, now, did I?
Granny Ruoxin: Let's just say that at my age, you sometimes find yourself remembering things that most people have forgotten.
Granny Ruoxin: When I was a child, everybody knew the tale of the Geo Lord suppressing the Chi.
Granny Ruoxin: But some people would say that even the Geo Lord himself couldn't wipe out the Chi completely, and so Geo Statues were used to press it down, slowly crushing it to death over time.
Granny Ruoxin: Haha. But of course, it's just an old story. If there was really a chance the Chi is still alive, we would hardly feel safe living here in Qingce Village.

Traveler: I have some fragments...
Granny Ruoxin: Let's see now... Why, these fragments all fit together.
Granny Ruoxin: See here, this is the symbol for a Chi, and this Chi was defeated in a major battle.
Granny Ruoxin: Afterward, it was pinned down in a deep place.
Traveler: What's a Chi?
Granny Ruoxin: In the legends, the Chi was a dragon-like monster, and Mt. Qingce was once its lair.
Granny Ruoxin: When Rex Lapis — or Morax — defeated it, the Chi's body twisted into rock, its blood turned into water, and its scales became the terraced fields.
Granny Ruoxin: Do you see those sturdy trees near Qingce Village? Those are Blood-Fed Trees, said to have been nourished by the blood of the Chi.
Granny Ruoxin: But a legend is a legend. After all, who would be able to find traces of the Chi today?
Traveler: What happened after that?
Granny Ruoxin: After that... in order to seal the corpse of the Chi and prevent it from endangering the world again, water was used to seal its corpse, and treasures were used to pin it in the center of the vault...
Granny Ruoxin: Hmm, the rest of it is illegible.
Traveler: Does the Chi's corpse still exist?
Granny Ruoxin: I'm afraid that other than Rex Lapis, no one else knows the answer to that question.
Granny Ruoxin: So, young one, do you think that the things recorded on these three fragments are true?
Granny Ruoxin: Well, it's not a bad thing for a young person to bumble around a bit.
Granny Ruoxin: But if you really want to pursue your search according to the content of these fragments, then I say that the place you're looking for must have something to do with *water*.
Granny Ruoxin: Not only that, but it must also be *water* whose *entrance* can be blocked.
Traveler: Is it... a waterfall?
Granny Ruoxin: Let me think... Come to think of it, there is a sizable waterfall northwest of Qingce Village. I wonder if it has something to do with that vault...
Granny Ruoxin: Well, that's all I know. As for the rest, you'll have to mull it over yourself.
Traveler: Is it a pool...?
Traveler: Vaults... Treasure!
Granny Ruoxin: Haha, young one... you can't resist the thought of treasure, can you?
Granny Ruoxin: So, do you think that the things recorded on these three fragments are true?

Traveler: Are you the village chief?
Granny Ruoxin: Actually I'm not. But after doing the same kind of work as a village chief for so long, it's what everyone calls me.
Granny Ruoxin: Ours is a gentle and peaceful village surrounded by clear waters and beautiful mountains. Life is pleasant here, and we don't want for food or water.
Granny Ruoxin: The only problem is that because it's too quiet here, the young people have all moved away to Liyue Harbor or elsewhere in Teyvat. We've not enough people left to share the work of the village.
Granny Ruoxin: We old folks have the responsibility of tending to the fields and looking after the grandchildren, so that our sons and daughters can work in whatever far-flung place they want without needing to worry about the family.

Traveler: Tell me about your past.
Granny Ruoxin: To be honest I wish I'd grown up here rather than in Liyue Harbor. Life would have been simpler, but more content.
Granny Ruoxin: I used to be an actress at the Heyu Tea House. I was living the high life, but when you're always acting there's a sense in which you lose touch with reality.
Granny Ruoxin: Back then, both I and the man I was with shared a dream of moving out to live in the country. We thought, even if that means no more fancy dinners and posh parties, life here will be genuine and everyone will be friendly.
Granny Ruoxin: I think I made the right choice in the end.

Granny Ruoxin: Welcome to Qingce Village, Traveler. You'll have to forgive us if it's not all too lively around there.
Granny Ruoxin: Our village is comprised largely of the very old and the very young, and since those meteorites came down, some of us have fallen asleep, unable to awaken. We can only hope that this blows over soon...

Granny Ruoxin: Here, these are for you. You've been out and about all day. Go buy something nice to eat, and rest your legs a bit.
Granny Ruoxin: So there was nothing inside... That's good, that's good...
Traveler: We found a whole bunch of Treasure Hoarders outside.
Granny Ruoxin: Treasure Hoarders? Did you chase them off?
Granny Ruoxin: Those low-down, no-good crooks, always skulking about. They're so annoying. It's high time someone taught them a lesson.

Granny Ruoxin: Here, take these. Go buy something nice to eat, and rest your legs a bit.
Traveler: Um, we didn't do that much...
Paimon: That's right, Granny, we didn't do anything at all!
Granny Ruoxin: Oh, listen to yourselves. Didn't you help us chase those Treasure Hoarders away from our village?
Granny Ruoxin: Allow me to give these to you as a token of appreciation, on behalf of everyone in Qingce Village.
Traveler: We don't take payment if the work's not done...

Granny Ruoxin: Maybe you're destined to live a lie when you choose to be an actress. Because those parting words spoken by my lover when he left have turned out to be the biggest lie of my whole life.
