Traveler: Freedom...
Atsuko: Perhaps everyone has a different understanding of and way of pursuing freedom...
Atsuko: Some people are quite content to spend their whole lives within the fences of their farm...
Atsuko: But not me! If there's anything that can fence me in, it's somewhere beyond these lands, beyond the seas, beyond the stars!
Atsuko: Only by breaking through these boundaries and going out into the world can we understand the value of freedom!
