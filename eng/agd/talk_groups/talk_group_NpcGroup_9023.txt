Traveler: How do you like it here?
Xiangling: I love it! Very cozy. And there are so many new and interesting things I've never seen before!
Xiangling: Just a shame more of them aren't potential ingredients...
Traveler: Considering all the things you class as ingredients, that's really saying something.
Xiangling: Hee-hee...
Xiangling: But really... Don't worry about it!
Xiangling: Combining existing ingredients in new ways already allows for countless variations in flavor.
Xiangling: The trick is to keep playing with different pairings — I've got plenty of new concepts to try out!
Xiangling: But, um... What would really make a difference is if you could taste-test them a—and give me some feedback.
Traveler: Sure! I'll give you my honest opinion. No sugarcoating.
Xiangling: Waah! Really? Great, I'll get cooking!
Traveler: I'll see what I can do about that...

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Xiangling: Absolutely! Service isn't for a while yet, so there's nothing on the stove.
Traveler: You really do enjoy cooking...
Xiangling: Yep! Gastronomy just makes me happy!
Xiangling: The best part is seeing smiles on my customers' faces. Those are the real fruits of my labor!
Xiangling: Oh — and...
Xiangling: ...It's really nothing to do with rare ingredients, secret recipes, or anything like that.
Xiangling: I just use my own methods and try to bring out the best in every ingredient! Certainly seems to satisfy my customers.
Xiangling: Still... it can be difficult at times.
Traveler: You mean when dishes don't work out?
Xiangling: Um... That does happen... but I wasn't talking so much about the food as...
Xiangling: Well, sometimes, customers get to talking to each other, and they chat for so long that their food starts to get cold...
Xiangling: I know I shouldn't really interrupt them, but reheating the food just ruins the flavor...
Traveler: Sounds frustrating.
Xiangling: It is! I knew you'd get it!
Xiangling: Hehe, I feel a lot better after talking to you about it, though.
Traveler: But there's nothing much you can do about it.
Xiangling: *sigh* Yeah, I know... I guess I just have to learn to not let it get to me.
Traveler: You mean when new concepts don't sell?

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Traveler: *Anything you'd like to do?*
Xiangling: I want to go adventuring with you!
Traveler: Again? Isn't that what we always do?
Xiangling: Mm-hmm! Sure is!
Xiangling: But even so, it's still the thing I wanna do most!
Xiangling: I want to go adventuring with you into the unknown, collect strange new ingredients from all over Teyvat, and invent new recipes for you to sample!
Xiangling: Ahh... the more I consider it, the more I think nothing could ever make me happier!
Traveler: (Happiness à la Xiangling is beautifully simple...)
Xiangling: Huh? You okay?
Xiangling: You seem very quiet... Y—You don't like the idea?
Xiangling: I won't add any strange seasonings... promise!
Xiangling: Um — what I mean is... I'll definitely get your opinion before acting on any eureka moments!
Xiangling: A—Also, I won't slow you down when we're out in the wilderness!
Xiangling: And if I encounter any serious enemies, I promise I won't cause any trouble. First sign of danger, I'll run as fast as I can...
Traveler: I never said I didn't like the idea...
Xiangling: Phew! ...You scared the heck out of me.
Xiangling: ...Awesome!
Xiangling: A—Anyway, I'll make sure to keep working on my cooking... a—and any other skills that might come in handy!
Xiangling: Anything to put a smile on your face!
Traveler: What you said got me thinking, that's all.
Xiangling: Ohhhh...
Traveler: I thought you'd want me to sample one of your creations.
Xiangling: Taste-testing is all part of the adventure!

## Talk 9

Xiangling: Awesome! This little street of eateries is pretty similar to Chihu Rock, but if you look closer, there are a lot of differences, too!
Xiangling: Let's go look at different restaurants together and see what makes each place unique, okay?
Xiangling: After that, I'll open another Wanmin Restaurant right here!

## Talk 10

Xiangling: Chefs can't be picky about location! No matter what kitchen appliances there are, I'll be back to cooking like I normally do after a few practice rounds!
Xiangling: Of course, you can't skimp on ingredients — only the freshest will do!
Xiangling: Hmm... There isn't too much stocked here. I'll whip up some food for us, so could you go and help me buy some ingredients?
