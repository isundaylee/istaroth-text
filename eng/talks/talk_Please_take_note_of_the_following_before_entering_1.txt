Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Please take note of the following before entering the hot springs."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "First, pick the right pool, and watch the water temperature, or you might get scalded. Travelers from abroad should get acclimated to an artificial pool first before trying any natural ones!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Next up, no playing around in the hot springs. Not only will this disturb others, but you might also slip and fall."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Last of all, know your limits. Don't be afraid to step out should you feel uncomfortable, and don't forget to drink water and eat some food to keep your stamina up."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "And remember kids, don't pour milk into the hot springs, and don't throw stones in either! Big Sis Mualani's gonna be mad otherwise!"
