Traveler: What're you doing?
Captain Wu: Ah, I'm just a regular seafarer. Worked hard my whole life, made a bit of Mora, now I'm debating whether to put it in savings or not...
Captain Wu: What do you think I should do? Save it, or put it to use?
Traveler: Save it.
Captain Wu: But, but, but... if I do that, what happens if the business opportunity of a lifetime comes along, and I've got no cash to invest?
Captain Wu: *sigh* Maybe you don't know. Being a trader can be very lucrative here in the Lord of Geo's country...
Captain Wu: If I used my capital to grow my business, I could really make a lot... Maybe one day I could even upgrade my boat to one like the type Ningguang has...
Traveler: Reinvest it.
Captain Wu: But, but, but, if I do that... What happens if the business goes south, and I lose everything in one go?
Captain Wu: Also, the Qixing are about to make some market readjustments. There's always a risk of getting caught out by their change in policy...
Captain Wu: If that happened to me, my lifetime's earnings could turn into sunk costs.
