Traveler: Ooh, a "high priest"...
Caholom: Ah, please don't expect too much from this title. Here, a high priest is just a priest with more experience.
Caholom: There's more than one high priest, and "high" does not refer to any kind of status or ability.
Caholom: ...Sorry, I don't mean to shirk any responsibility by saying this. I'm just doing this in hopes that visitors will get a general understanding of our tribe.
Caholom: Well, let's get back on track. Come see me if you need any help from us.
