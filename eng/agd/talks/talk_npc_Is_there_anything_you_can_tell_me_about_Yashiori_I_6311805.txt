Traveler: Is there anything you can tell me about Yashiori Island?
Miyazaki Saburou: You have probably already been to the places around the Sangonomiya camp, right? If you go further south, there are some places of interest on the other side of the Musoujin Gorge. I wouldn't recommend going there though.
Miyazaki Saburou: Inside Higi Village across the valley, I heard that the villagers have caught some strange illness. Those who could flee already have. The remaining bunch have all gone quite mad.
Miyazaki Saburou: It's probably because the village lies too close to the remains of gods and demons, so they were haunted by the Tatarigami.
Miyazaki Saburou: I heard a god's power will still linger around even if they have already been slain... So for your own sake, don't go further south.
