# Missing title (3444272967)


## Talk 1

Araminali: #Nara {NICKNAME} wants to open the "treasure chests"? But... There are still a lot of Aranara in need in Vana, if the Golden Nara can help these Aranara...
Araminali: Araminali will fill the "treasure chests" with treasure! Together with the "good stuff" sent back by Aranimba, the "treasure chests" will be filled with good stuff.

## Talk 2

Araminali: #Araminali knows the Golden Nara is a good Nara who helped Aranara. So Araminali's "treasure chests" are for Nara {NICKNAME}.

## Talk 3

Araminali: #Araminali heard that Nara {NICKNAME} was "showing off {M#his}{F#her} skills" in Vana.
Araminali: #"Treasure" has been put in the "chest," Nara {NICKNAME} can open the "treasure chest," "you are welcome"!

## Talk 4

Araminali: #Nara {NICKNAME}, and Paimon, hurry up! Araminali's treasure chests are ready, and Araminali has been waiting for a long time...
Araminali: Aranara's good friends. "Treasure chests" have been filled up. Time to open them!

## Talk 5

Araminali: #Araminali has been told by many Aranara that Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon did a lot of good things...
Araminali: Araminali already knew it. Those praise words, running through the branches of the forest, wading through the trickle, along with the breeze, are blown into the "happy nest" of Araminali!
Araminali: #So this time, Araminali filled the "chests" up and wait for Nara {NICKNAME} to open.
Araminali: #The sparkling things brought back by Aranimba were also stuffed in the "chests." Maybe Nara {NICKNAME} will like them?
Traveler: Didn't Aranimba come back?
Araminali: Well, unlike a big tree with a deep root. Aranimba is the kind of Aranara who doesn't stop.
Paimon: Eh... Won't Araminali be lonely here?
Araminali: What does "lonely" mean?
Paimon: Um... That is, when you are alone, you really want to have someone around you?
Araminali: There are many Aranara in Vanarana so Araminali is not "lonely" at all.
Araminali: With that being said, Arayama and Aranimba are no longer in Vanarana. These three Aranara used to stick together, and they were so happy no matter what they did.
Araminali: Arayama's Ararakalari is very strong. Weak Nara can do nothing about it. Aranimba is very good at painting, all kinds of things, all look good.
Araminali: But now, there are only Araminali and his "treasure chest."
Paimon: Araminali...
Araminali: It's fine. Araminali has many "treasure chests," although Araminali doesn't know why Nara likes opening chests...
Araminali: But Araminali is the owner of the "treasure chests." Nara, who likes treasure chests, also likes Araminali, right?
Araminali: However, Araminali has no more "treasures" left, um... the "chests" will be empty for a while.
Araminali: #Though Araminali's "treasure chests" are about to be empty, Nara {NICKNAME} will still be Aranara's good friend, no?

## Talk 6

Araminali: #Araminali is not ready! The "treasure chests" are still hungry. Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon can "lazy about"...
Araminali: #Hmm, no, not right. Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon can "roam around." That way, might run into Aranara in need of help.

## Talk 7

Araminali: #Araminali has a full belly. "Treasure chests" are still hungry. Hungry is not good. Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon walk everywhere, must be very hungry. Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon must eat a lot of mushrooms to gain energy.
