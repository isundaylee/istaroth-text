(Quest is part of chapter: From One Case to Another)

# Beat the Clock: 24 Hours


## Talk 1

Taruka: Oberon and I'll wait here for you to return with more information. Thanks!
Oberon: Crooo...

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hmm... Lamizana should be *deeper within* if he really is here, right? After all, he's gonna want this discussion hidden from others!
Paimon: If only we could *sneak in among the Iktomisaurs*...

## Talk 3

Paimon: (Hmm... Paimon can't see clearly from here, but they might spot us if we get closer. It's better to listen from where we are for now.)
Cuyen (Gentle Voice): We're really happy with the quality of the last batch of goods. We'll be counting on you again this time.
Paran (Deep Voice): Not a problem at all. Just follow the usual protocol?
Cuyen (Gentle Voice): Yes. We'll need the goods delivered before the air race. Someone's gonna need it.
Paran (Deep Voice): No problem. They should be just about done talking over there too, so let's wrap up and leave.
Paimon: (Huh? Are they leaving already? That's not what Paimon imagined... Let's head back ourselves. Don't let them catch you!)

## Talk 4

Taruka: #Mr. Traveler! Thank goodness you're safe. I was so worried.
Paimon: It sure was thrilling! But, uh... But it's a bit hard to describe, so we'll discuss that later...
Black Screen Text: You tell Taruka what you saw and heard at the camp...
Taruka: Really? You saw Ms. Quilla, but not Lamizana...
Paimon: Well, they mentioned an air race and a transaction. Paimon doesn't know the details, but it sounds like it's for something that will be used during the race.
Taruka: Ms. Quilla is a traveling merchant who showed up recently. According to Paran, she deals in a wide variety of goods. Maybe Lamizana purchased something dangerous from her...
Taruka: I see. So he wants to carry out his dangerous plan during the air race!
Traveler: What kind of dangerous plan?
Taruka: I don't know... but I'm sure he's plotting something dangerous!
Paran: #Ah, so this is where you are. Wonderful! You must be Traveler, right? Lamizana tells me that you've tried out the training course and that you did quite well.
Traveler: It wasn't a big deal.
Paran: Here's the situation. The race is about to begin, but the contestant who was supposed to race against Lliwa has pulled out at the last minute.
Paran: And well... You know her, Taruka, she's always been extremely competitive, so she won't be happy with winning a freebie...
Taruka: Then she can pull out too. Which is just as well — I'll go to persuade her to do that right now!
Paran: W—Wait, we can't do that! She also prepared hard for this race, so isn't the best solution to find someone just as good for her to race against...
Paimon: #Is that why you've come to Traveler?
Paran: Yes. As long as you participate, we'll be sure to compensate you no matter where you end up in the standings...
Traveler: Okay, now you're really looking down on me.
Paran: Huh? Oh, you're right... Well, if you end up in a top spot, we'll give you the reward for your ranking and a bonus to boot.
Paran: Thanks for agreeing! You'll receive the invitation letter later. I have some other preparations to make, so I probably won't see you until race day.
Black Screen Text: Paran leaves, taking Carrewoof with him...
Paimon: #Traveler, you agreed because this would give us the chance to investigate up close, right? If anything happens during the race, the contestants would be the first to know.
Traveler: I also have a feeling that things aren't as simple as they seem.
Paimon: Speaking of which, there was something familiar about Paran's voice. Have we heard it somewhere recently?
Taruka: He's in charge of all sorts of things here at the flying school. He and Carrewoof are always running around everywhere, so it's actually harder to avoid hearing his voice.
Paimon: That makes sense! Come to think of it, Paimon seems to have read about something like this in a story...
Paimon: If someone who blends in with the background commits a crime, people usually won't suspect them because they are so used to their presence.
Taruka: Hmm... Best not to say that in front of him, though. His family was exiled because some of his family members did something terrible.
Taruka: Lots of people have been using that as an excuse to make things difficult for him... Maybe that's why he's so strict with himself but so considerate of others.
Taruka: Although he's quite close to Lamizana, I have to admit he's a pretty nice guy.
Traveler: Is Lamizana some kind of pest?
Taruka: Even pests are a hundred times cuter than him.
Paimon: Thanks for telling Paimon that! It would be bad if we hurt him, even if it's by accident. Anyway, about the race...
Paimon: #Taruka, you don't have to worry about your sister. Traveler will look out for her!
Taruka: Hmm... I'll be waiting for you guys near the finish line. Lamizana and I should finish first, so I'll watch him like a hawk!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Hrrooo?
Paimon: #This isn't your time to shine, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}. Just enjoy the show with Paimon this time, alright?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wrrah...
Traveler: It looks like he's got it rough.
Traveler: No, I just want the participation prize...
Paimon: C'mon, just play along, even if just to make yourself seem a bit cooler!
Traveler: Woohoo! A guaranteed participation trophy.
Paimon: Hey, what happened to your ambition!?
Traveler: Really? Looking down on me, is he?
Paran: No, that's not it! Wait, what would Temach say in this situation... I know! The training course must've held you back!
Traveler: What's his motive, though?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: Paimon was so worried that she broke out in a cold sweat! Good thing she hid, or else that lady would have caught Paimon instead of paying attention to you two Saurians!
Traveler: You escaped without us...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wrroo...
Traveler: Any slower, and this would have become an impossible crime...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wrroo...
Paimon: Sure, no one can accuse the Iktomisaur... Well, you, but don't say scary stuff like that!
Paimon: A—Anyway, Paimon was just making adjustments to the plan on the fly! You wouldn't have been able to get away if she hadn't caused a commotion outside.
Paimon: Sure was lucky that the box was filled with Saurus Crackers. The Iktomisaurs swarmed all over them after the box was knocked over. It was pandemonium!
Paimon: But Paimon didn't see Lamizana outside either, or the people who'd taken part in the transaction earlier. Seems like neither one was Lamizana, though. Their voices sounded different.
Paimon: Hmm... Either way, let's tell Taruka what we saw and heard earlier.

### Additional Talk 2

Lliwa: Ugh, this is trouble...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Lliwa: Well, I have a little brother who's a lot younger than me. Maybe it's because he's in his rebellious years, but he doesn't get along with anyone...
Lliwa: Bah, I'll only add to your troubles by telling you about this. Things will probably get better when he grows up!
Traveler: Sorry to bother you.
Lliwa: It's no trouble. See you around.

### Additional Talk 3

Temach: We still have a few more flying challenges. Details are written on the board. Give 'em a try if you're keen... Of course, there are prizes to be won.
Traveler: About the Pakpaka Flying School...
Temach: Honestly, I have no clue why it's called that. But speaking of Pakpaka... Have you ever heard the story of Kuntur and the evil sorcerer Rumi?
Temach: The warriors of the tribe were defeated by that wicked mage, and he turned them into Pakpaka... which doesn't sound all that good. Maybe Pakpakas fly very quickly, or something — I don't know.
Traveler: About Lamizana...
Temach: Haha... He's a good fighter, but not necessarily a good teacher. And as an opponent in flying competitions... I guess he's passable?
Temach: But I mean, why would you come here if you didn't have issues with flying? So, if I were to be too strict... *sigh* Well, it's not like things like this have never happened in the past.
Temach: That's why I focus on encouraging people nowadays. I'm sure that approach will get results just fine too.
Traveler: Gotta go.
Temach: See you. You're welcome back any time.

### Additional Talk 4

Cisik: Welcome to Pakpaka Flying School!
Traveler: What do you do here?
Cisik: We give all cadets the necessary guidance and help they need. Things have changed a lot, you know. Back in the day, students couldn't expect that kind of tender loving care.
Cisik: But then there was this one time when the coach was a little... strict with their words, and the student in question just happened to have quite a temper... *sigh* Yeah, that's not a fun one to talk about.
Cisik: Anyway, our teaching policy's been shaken up since then. And I mean, nobody slaps a smiling face, and nobody hates compliments, am I right?
Traveler: I'll be off, then.
Cisik: Here's to a pleasant day!

### Additional Talk 5

Oberon: Taruka seems unhappy. What happened...?
