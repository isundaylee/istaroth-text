# Talk Dialog

Sanad: My dear sister, uh, may I ask a... um... favor?
Zohreh: Why are you talking to me like that? Don't tell me you've got yourself into some trouble at the Akademiya!
Sanad: No, not at all! Everything's fine with school!
Sanad: I just want to borrow your theses!
Sanad: Don't worry. I won't copy them! I just need some reference materials! Yeah, that's what they are for, reference only!
Zohreh: Well, I can lend them to you, but my research back then is probably out of date now.
Zohreh: What's more, if it's something of reference value, it's probably already archived in the Akasha. Why don't you apply for access?
Zohreh: Instead of borrowing my out-of-date theses, why don't you discuss your ideas with top students in your school?
Sanad: My roommate is indeed a top achiever... One could even say he's an overacheiver. No one can understand the things he writes in his assignments except for our mentors.
Sanad: *sigh* Speaking of him, I bet he must be burning midnight oil now. I should bring him some food and coffee on my way back.
