Traveler: Betting on jade?
Shitou: Oh? This is your first time at The Jade Mystery?
Shitou: Here at The Jade Mystery, we pride ourselves in our generations of expertise in crafting jade finery. We have quite a reputation in Liyue, if I do say so myself.
Shitou: Though the industry hasn't been as booming recently. The Ministry of Civil Affairs has shut down the Chasm, cutting off supplies.
Shitou: As such, the raw materials are worth more than the finished goods these days... So I figured, why not sell the uncut rocks off? Betting on them is exciting, and who knows, perhaps I might just make some money.
Shitou: Now all my old card game buddies come here to bet on jade. Business is better than a few other places around here, that's for sure...
