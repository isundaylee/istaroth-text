Jeht: #Oh, it's you, Traveler. What's going on? Is something wrong?
Traveler: About the Eternal Oasis...
Jeht: It's all thanks to you that we managed to get to the Eternal Oasis. Without your help, we would have never been able to open the path.
Jeht: I don't even know how to thank you... Next time we start a bonfire, we should talk about this by the flames. It'll be just like...
Jeht: Just like that time with Azariq... Ah...
Jeht: ...That traitorous dog...
Traveler: I'm sorry...
Jeht: You've got nothing to be sorry about... I wasn't mad at you.
Jeht: Honestly, the Matriarch had already warned me to keep my guard up before we left. I might be careless — well, just a bit. But I'm not stupid.
Jeht: The schematics of that ancient machine... Not sharing that with the tribe was a crime. The moment I realized that, I started suspecting him.
Jeht: What I didn't expect, though, was his willingness to keep pursuing his schemes even after all the time we spent around each other... He really thought he could manipulate me...
Jeht: I feel disgusted just thinking about it...
Jeht: Thankfully, Matriarch Babel has always been on my side. I believe that she can help the tribe find prosperity again.
Jeht: She will. Absolutely.
Jeht: And you! You've always been in my corner as well!
Traveler: Yeah. I'm a Jeht-person too, you know!
Jeht: Jeht-person? That sounds so... weird. Like a nickname Paimon might give.
Jeht: #But seriously, thanks, Traveler... Really.
Traveler: What if I come into conflict with the Matriarch?
Jeht: ...
Jeht: Ha! You're kidding. You're the Tanit's esteemed guest, the one who brought the Mother of the Jinn back and found the path to the Eternal Oasis...
Jeht: I can't think of any reason why you and the Matriarch might come into conflict.
Traveler: Never mind...
Jeht: Yeah, so... If you ever need my help, just let me know.

Jeht: Oh, it's you. Back from Gurabad, eh?
Jeht: Ah, yes. Is there something you need? Things have been quite busy back here with the Tanit...
Traveler: About Liloupar...
Jeht: Yes, I heard. She left and went back to that cursed place.
Jeht: Hmph. She was peacocking around the whole time, driving me up the wall... and now she's finally silent. What a relief.
Jeht: Still, she did help us a great deal... Come to think of it, what do you think she'll find there? And if there's nothing to be found... I wonder if she'll feel lonely... Like how we felt lonely?
Jeht: It's a shame that I couldn't go with you...
Traveler: Any problems with the Tanit?
Jeht: Agh, it's nothing major. Can't talk about it right now, though...
Jeht: It's about something within the tribe, and maybe those northerners too. I don't know the details either, to be honest.
Jeht: However... Ah...
Jeht: However...!
Jeht: Agh. Sorry. The reason I'm acting like this... What I mean to say is... If I...
Jeht: No! I—If you meet with danger, then believe me when I say that I'll always be there to help you.
Jeht: And if I'm the one in trouble... I believe you'll come for me too, won't you?
Traveler: Of course.
Jeht: Alright... Thanks. You should... keep an eye out for enemies, okay?
Traveler: Of course, but don't forget to pay once I'm done.
Jeht: Hmph... Don't dodge the question with that mercenary talk.
Jeht: Just... be careful.
Traveler: About Benben...
Jeht: We're lucky you took that stuff from those northerners. Benben is recovering and looking better already.
Jeht: Almost as good as when we first met it...
Traveler: Then, when you have the time...
Jeht: Yeah, we'll talk more when I have more time...
Jeht: Oh, right! Right...
Jeht: It's nothing... If you run into any trouble, any danger at all, I'll be right at your side. So... Be careful.

Jeht: Yeah, so... If you ever need my help, just let me know.
