# Peace to the Slumbering


## Talk 1

???: Come... over here...
???: You have brought so many slumberers, they who should have rested in peace...

## Talk 2

???: *hiss* Ugh— Aaah— I told you— It's dangerous, g—get out of here—
???: Calamity— the seal— torn apart—
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Hroo... Rowrr...
Titu: That voice is more complete now, but... Somehow, it's not as frightening as before.
Titu: My head still hurts a little, though.
Paimon: #How you feeling, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: It's no big deal.
Paimon: That's good...
Paimon: #Anyway! How are you feeling, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Mmm?
Paimon: Yeah, looks like you're fine, too.
Titu: Now that we're here, it's clear that the voices we heard coming from the stone pillar must've been...
Traveler: Those of the Khaenri'ahn soldiers who've been sealed here too...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rrooh...
Paimon: That means they were sealed in for many years, alongside the Abyss... But what's gone wrong here?
Titu: I think... The problem here is similar to the one we encountered with the Lesser Shadow Pins above. The surging Abyss has caused the Iridescent Inscription's power to shatter and be squeezed out of that giant sealing pillar...
Paimon: That means we'll need to find the large Inscription's fragments and find a way to put this "eggshell" back together again, right?
Titu: Indeed. That way, the seal can be fully restored, and the Abyss will stay sealed in this place. Then... Everything will likely go back to normal.
Titu: But as with the Lesser Shadow Pins, the solid phlogiston surface will have an intense adversarial reaction to the Abyss, which is why the ground undulates so...
Titu: We must be careful.
Paimon: Where are we gonna find said fragments, though?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr... Rawr!
Paimon: #Huh? Can you sense the Inscription's power hidden inside that thing, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}? You sure do have a pretty sharp nose... Wait, you were using your nose, right?
Paimon: Wait, was that stone even there before?
Titu: #Did it... just appear as you approached the large Inscription, {NICKNAME}?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Hmm?
Paimon: Well, whatever. Let's take a look around that rock first, shall we?
Traveler: Now that's what they call "surround sound."
Paimon: What? That's not what Paimon was asking at all!

## Talk 3

Titu: Just touch it once more and let the power of the phlogiston flow fully through the Inscription. That way, the "eggshell" should seal up completely... preventing the Abyss from escaping.
Paimon: Yeah, that should solve our problem...
Titu: Hmm... Let me try...
???: Quick, quick! Seal us inside too— Just as we agreed—
???: *hiss*— Then leave. Get out of here— Why aren't you leaving— The calamity—
Titu: Listen! There are more voices — more than those two soldiers, for sure.
Black Screen Text: Behind the glowing inscriptions, from a place further still than the anguished howls...
You hear wrathful roars, and the pained whimpering of Saurians.
You hear the sound of inchoate flesh and blood merging, the sick, giant, sticky, approaching footfalls of some giant thing beyond description.
But you also hear something like thousands of hands, thousands constantly resisting, pushing outward...
Black Screen Text: You hear the endless battle in the narrow darkness.
It is... torment unto eternity.
Traveler: They cannot find peace...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Titu: Those heroes are still locked in battle to this day, preventing the Abyss from flooding out from the Iridescent Inscription.
Titu: The stories I tell have purpose. We must always remember those brave warriors and their sacrifices.
Titu: And yet... Such suffering. "Though the heroes were wounded, they shook it off, and stood up, nothing hurt withal." That is what the stories say.
Titu: But real wounds cannot be so easily shaken, nor true torment so easily conquered... There they have suffered so long, in that tiny, lightless world.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Hroo!
Paimon: Isn't there... anything we can do for them?
Titu: I want to as well, but the Abyss...
Titu: Perhaps the only thing we can do is inherit their will and reseal the Inscription. Nor has this been the first time the Shadow Pin has fallen — in our tribe's tales, anyway.
Titu: Someone must have been here before, and someone must have read Traore's tablet. Those who came before to restore the Inscription must have seen what we saw.
Titu: And yet... Our stories did not change, for the warnings they gave were real, as were the dangers.
Titu: All we can do is restore the Inscription and leave. To remember always, and never forget all that we have witnessed...
Paimon: Still... Ugh. They're supposed to be heroes! But they've been left here to suffer forever...
Traveler: You're right, Paimon.
Traveler: This is no end for heroes.
Titu: I know that. I wish to give them peace, too. But I don't have that power. I'm just... a storyteller.
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rrooh!
Traveler: Don't worry. We're strong together.
Titu: #...Really? You'd do that, {NICKNAME}?
Paimon: #Of course {M#he}{F#she} would. Cross Paimon's heart!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Titu: The Abyss is dangerous beyond compare... I'm not questioning your strength, but don't push yourself too hard.
Paimon: Don't worry. We've got experience with stuff like this — and we have the Inscription in a pinch, too.
Titu: True...
Titu: *sigh* You're even more impressive than I could have imagined. To be willing to give your all to resolve others' pain... Truly, you are great heroes.
Titu: #And I am a storyteller... so I will record the tales of heroes. Well then, {NICKNAME}, O hero from another land, please... Show me how you shall valiantly triumph over the Abyss.
Traveler: That we shall do.
Titu: So... Shall we unseal the Iridescent Inscription now, or do you want to make some preparations first?
Traveler: Let's go now.
Titu: #Alright. I wish you success, {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: One moment. Let's prep real quick.
Titu: #Sure. Do all you need to... and be careful, {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: Let's rewrite this story's ending.
Traveler: They fight on still...

## Talk 4

Paimon: Well, this is weird. There was all that scattered light earlier... and then we suddenly found ourselves here...?
Paimon: Huh. That's...
"Beast With Fur Like That of Night": Come... over here...
"Beast With Fur Like That of Night": You have brought so many slumberers, they who should have rested in peace...
"Beast With Fur Like That of Night": Perhaps they prayed to spirits they should not have beseeched...
"Beast With Fur Like That of Night": But that was a moonless night, where naught could be seen. The Night has long forgiven them. Yet hate and filth shall never rest, and they too shall never truly sleep again.
"Beast With Fur Like That of Night": Thank you, O you who are beloved... You have soothed their fury, which raged in the darkness. It was you who brought them into the Night's reflection. The outland souls, too, may now return where they were headed...
"Beast With Fur Like That of Night": ...
"Beast With Fur Like That of Night": Go now. But beware the fearful instigators, and the ends plotted by those bearing ill-intent.

## Talk 5

Titu: #You're back! {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} and I were worried, honestly.
Titu: But hah, what did I say, little fella? They're fine, see?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Oooroo...
Paimon: Heh. Not that we could explain where we went just now...
Traveler: It's a long story for sure...
Titu: #In any case, thank you, {NICKNAME}. I never expected that the Abyss here could truly be purified.
Titu: The Iridescent Inscription, too, is gone — almost as if it no longer needed to stay. The tormented voices have also fallen silent.
Titu: And that golden light! How it flowed like water, spreading across the ground.
Titu: I even felt as if there were people within that light, waving at us...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Titu: Did you see them too, little one? And there was that light that surrounded you — and then you were gone.
Paimon: Huh. We didn't see anything, though...
Titu: #*sigh* Thank you so much once again, {NICKNAME}, Paimon. You too, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}.
Titu: You truly are remarkable heroes. Thank you, on behalf of all those warriors who can finally know peace. Traore's final wishes have been fulfilled, and...
Titu: As for those two Khaenri'ahn soldiers— no, Khaenri'ahn heroes! Now that the Abyss is no longer present, they need no longer serve as a warning to us.
Titu: I must pen a story about them, about how they helped save the Children of Echoes... In truth, I did have a flash of revelation as to what their thoughts must've been.
Titu: The Abyss represents such terrible peril that, were it up to me, I too might have made up some horror story to keep others from the tribe clear of this place.
Titu: *sigh* It seems almost funny how I was previously worried about having nothing to write. Now there's almost too much here — in our tale about a golden-haired outlander, a flying white fairy, a little Tepetlisaurus, and how they saved our tribe.
Paimon: Hehe, that sounds like a pretty awesome synopsis already!
Titu: Indeed. Stories pass on and stories change. Perhaps one day, a long, long time hence, even you might become as big as a mountain, Paimon.
Traveler: Haargh! Behold, the mighty mountain, Paimon!
Paimon: Hmph! Look ye, how she swallows a Sweet Madame the size of a Sumpter Beast in a single bite!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Rawr!
Titu: Haha, I doubt there'd be too many of those, Paimon.
Titu: And as these stories pass down... I imagine that those two soldiers, too, will eventually become heroes. They might not have cared themselves, but I know that this is what I must do.
Titu: #Once again, {NICKNAME}, Paimon, you have my utmost thanks... You too, of course, sharp little {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Titu: As a storyteller, I swear to write for you the most exciting tale of adventure!
Titu: Speaking of that— Oh, I should probably... head back to the sentry post to take up my shift.
Titu: I'd almost forgotten about that amidst all the excitement...
Titu: ...Ugh. I sure hope Yukom doesn't tear me a new one for being gone so long!
Paimon: Yeah, uh, you should totally get back there pronto!
Traveler: We saw a glowing cat...
Titu: I—I see...

## Talk 6

Titu: #Hah... What do you think, {NICKNAME}. Shall we unseal the Iridescent Inscription now?
Traveler: Yes. Let's begin.
Titu: Then I'll get to it... But please, be very careful.
Traveler: Give me a moment more to prepare.
Titu: No worries. Just tell me once you're done...

## Talk 7

"Zephaniah": "Leave... Seal this place— as promised—"
"Zephaniah": (That voice seems to come from the very depths of the unmoving statue. The rejection in those words are like two resolute hands that aim to push you from this place...)

## Talk 8

"Irizar": "Leave! Go... I don't want him to see me— like this—"
"Irizar": (The voice seems to come from the very depths of the unmoving statue. There is a hint of respect toward someone remaining within...)

## Talk 9

Yukom: Uh, are you guys alright? What happened just now?
Yukom: There was this sudden, massive earthquake! I was pretty worried, honestly, but it's good that you're alright.
Yukom: As for Titu... Why hasn't that guy come to take over this post yet? Ugh. I'd rather the earthquake flattened me at this point!

## Talk 10

Titu: #Ah, it's you, mighty {NICKNAME}! How are things going? Have you gone on another adventure? If you've heard any more amazing stories, I'm all ears!
Titu: Tell you what, I've got a brother at the Saurian Relics Association. Name's Manqu, and man, if I told him what we saw at the Shadow Pins...
Titu: He'd go so green with envy, it might kill him! Gonna wait till I get back from my post to break it to him, though.
Traveler: About marked Saurian young...
Titu: #You mean {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}? Well, all I know is that it's not a good sign.
Titu: I've heard that such marked Saurians are rejected by the Night Kingdom, the tribes, and the Saurians too. They die as they lived, alone.
Titu: #But that's just superstition. I mean, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}'s got you, right?
Traveler: About the tales of those heroes...
Titu: I'm giving it some thought. Uh, not that I'd let it affect my sentry work, though, no sir! I'm a real multitasker.
Titu: Those two from Khaenri'ah have a terrible reputation here in the tribe. All the more reason for my story to be as exciting as possible!
Titu: So yeah, I've got to give this all the consideration it's due!
Traveler: About storytellers...
Titu: We're an amazing bunch, we are!
Titu: Take, for example... Sanhaj from the Masters of the Night-Wind, whom all storytellers revere...
Titu: They say he had every scroll written up to his time committed to memory, and that he was willing to go from tribe to tribe and share those tales... That said, they also say that he often tricked people, mooching food and drink off them.
Titu: Stories speak of bygone times, and they represent the wisdom of our forebears. Thus, the mere act of sharing it was seen as a selfless act, so all both loved and hated cunning Sanhaj.
Titu: Later, that tale-telling hero would himself become part of a heroic tale — a fate I doubt even he ever envisioned... But yeah. Sanhaj was an amazing storyteller.
Titu: Still, the characters in his tales were all tribal warriors of a sort, but in mine, we'll also include a golden-haired outlander, a silver-haired fairy, and a little Saurian with a red scarf.
Titu: So, if only in terms of the variety of main characters, I'm the winner here!
Traveler: See you! Guard your post well!
Titu: #Alright, alright. See you, {NICKNAME}.

## Talk 11

Yukom: *sigh* I didn't expect this round of guard duty to last that long. Well, Titu's finally back, at least...
Traveler: Hey there! Who are you?
Yukom: Haha, me? You're a curious guest. Call me Yukom. As you can see, I'm a guard at this sentry post — one of them, anyway.
Yukom: #But word to the wise, {M#brother}{F#sister} — you probably shouldn't just walk up to and talk to someone in the wilds here like that...
Yukom: This is the outer edge of the Children of Echoes' lands. Once you leave this area, you'll enter territory where any warrior's fair game to spar.
Traveler: What are you doing here, exactly?
Yukom: Oh, you know, guarding, standing... waiting.
Yukom: Alright, so I'm a little bored, and a bit tired, too. This is the Children of Echoes' sentry post, which people take turns to stand guard over every day.
Yukom: This is my "duty" within the tribe.
Traveler: Titu's back. Not gonna take a break?
Yukom: What does it look like I'm doing, eh? And now that he is, I no longer need to stare at those ominous winds, strange mutterings, and twisting shadows.
Yukom: #Just need to watch others work — that's the best kinda rest, {M#brother}{F#sister}!
Traveler: See you!
Yukom: Aye, see you. Take care!
