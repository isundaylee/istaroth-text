Traveler: How's the festival going?
Murata: This Irodori Festival is different from ones in years past. I imagine that it's quite the sight for our guests.
Murata: That said, I'm just here to collect the Mora, give out the change, thank people for their patronage... the works.
Murata: Ah, sorry, no time for chit-chat. If Hirayama catches me, I'll be in hot stew for sure!
