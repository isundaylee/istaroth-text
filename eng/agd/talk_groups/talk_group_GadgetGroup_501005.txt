Flight Regulations: "8. In non-emergency situations, please follow the ground guides, keep to fixed flight paths, and take off and landings at safe speeds. Dangerous actions are strictly prohibited."
Flight Regulations: "Note: 'The Saurian did it' shall not be considered an acceptable excuse. Qucusaurs have an innate capacity for safe flight, but humans do not."

## Talk

Flight Trial Notice: "All candidates wishing to take part in the flight test must first clear mental aptitude and physical examinations before being allowed to practice take-offs."
Flight Trial Notice: "Meanwhile, all flight-related training must be conducted under the protection and supervision of a tutor. Any unauthorized training will result in permanent loss of eligibility for flight trials."
Flight Trial Notice: "Administrators reserve the right to terminate any training currently underway, and if a termination signal is received, please follow all instructions in returning to the arena."

Emergency Notice: "Listen carefully, everyone: I have discussed this with the chief, and everyone needs to be examined again. Only those who make the cut in both mental and physical aptitude will be issued their wings once more!"
Emergency Notice: "Otherwise, you will be required to stay in the vicinity of the arena to receive treatment. All candidates must undergo re-examination, especially anyone who has come into contact with Abyssal forces!"
Emergency Notice: "Of course, if you don't wish to undergo testing again, all you have to do is beat Miss Chasca in combat, and we'll consider you fighting fit!"
Emergency Notice: "Can't quite manage that? Haha, then quit yapping and get your treatment sorted! Once treated, you'll be allowed to fly again."

Flight Regulations: "34: Those who release junk while airborne will be subject to lifetime imprisonment."
Flight Regulations: "For the safety of everyone, nobody is allowed to release any airborne objects around the trial grounds without obtaining prior approval. This includes kites, balloons, and birds!"
Flight Regulations: "In a previous case, someone released a balloon and it impacted a Qucusaurus' flight path. If it weren't for a flying squad member administering timely assistance, the results would have been disastrous!"
Flight Regulations: "The chief has also stated that safety is paramount. This kind of thing cannot happen again. So follow the rules, everyone!"

## Talk

Flight Regulations: "52: Do not shout or scream while flying, and do not make strange noises."
Flight Regulations: "The former will disorient other people (or Saurians), while the latter may be misinterpreted as an instruction by Qucusaurs, thus creating unnecessary safety hazards."
Flight Regulations: "Note: 'I'm singing' shall not be considered a valid excuse for making strange noises. The definition of what constitutes a 'song' here shall be left to the majority consensus of people (or Saurians)."

## Talk

Flight Regulations: "37: For safety reasons, please do not carry any creatures with you incapable of flight."
Flight Regulations: "Note: In theory, humans are also a species without plumage who walk on two legs, and who are incapable of flight."
Flight Regulations: "Further Note: 'My friend has a wind glider â€” that totally counts as having flight capabilities' shall not be considered a valid excuse."

## Talk

Flight Regulations: "26: Please do not carry any valuables with you when flying to avoid dropping them."
Flight Regulations: "If a similar situation occurs, please ask any flying squad for assistance."
Chief's Message: "Due to the variance in difficulty involved in finding different items, our flying squads cannot guarantee definite retrieval of any lost belongings. Please pay close attention and follow all regulations."
