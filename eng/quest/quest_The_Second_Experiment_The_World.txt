# The Second Experiment: The World


## Talk 1

Examine Statue: (A shelf packed with books and potions. Looks like the owner has a habit of reading and researching potions simultaneously.)

## Talk 2

Examine Salinized Adherent: (Looks like an alchemy work table. Some potions and other apparatus are laid out here. Are these what Albedo uses to investigate the world?)
Examine Salinized Adherent: (It wouldn't hurt to touch it... would it?)

## Talk 3

Examine Salinized Adherent: (A board with some incomprehensible experimental reports stuck onto it.)
Examine Salinized Adherent: (Still, you can tell that progress is being made on those experiments.)

## Talk 4

Albedo: I'm back. Did you see anything interesting?
Traveler: Couldn't make heads or tails of anything.
Albedo: Not to worry, they're all for alchemical purposes, you'd be hard pressed to find an everyday use for them.
Albedo: Well, on with the research.
Albedo: There may be significant differences between different worlds.
Albedo: Take Teyvat, for example. Here, those with Visions can manipulate the elements.
Albedo: But worlds may well exist where only one person is able to do so, or even everyone.
Albedo: #So, leaving elements to one side... Do you possess any... unique abilities, {NICKNAME}? Ones that don't exist in this world?
Albedo: I think answering this question calls for the same methodology as last time. In other words, time for the next experiment.
Traveler: Am I battling slimes again?
Albedo: No, no! You shan't be required to exert quite so much effort this time around.
Albedo: Now, see this pillar here. Use your willpower to try and break it.
Traveler: Sorry, I just can't do it.
Albedo: That was your best effort? Hmm... Well, can't be helped, I suppose.
Paimon: What's with the disappointment!? Isn't that, like, impossible?
Albedo: Ah! Have you tried using your elemental power with food? I don't mean for cooking as such — rather, channeling your power into the ingredients themselves.
Albedo: I'm curious to see how the taste and texture respond. It may even help with... proliferation...
Traveler: Alchemists certainly have active imaginations.
Albedo: Haha, I suppose I have a curiosity for things that others find surprising.
Albedo: Anyway, why don't you cook us up a Sunshine Sprat? I've just finished preparing the recipe.
Paimon: Cooking? Paimon was looking forward to more mad scientist stuff!
Albedo: Not only is this recipe a staple for me, it's also worth experimenting with and highly nutritious!
Paimon: Hmph, Paimon bets you're just hungry!
Paimon: It does sound yummy though... Okay, Paimon approves!
Traveler: I know what you're getting at.
Paimon: Mm-hmm, good buddies are always on the same page!
Albedo: I'll leave you to it, then. Looking forward to the results.
Albedo: If there's anything left over, maybe Timaeus can finish the last morsels.
Paimon: Uhh... Paimon doesn't think we'll have that problem.
Traveler: I'll save you a fin or two.
Traveler: Sure you're not just peckish?
Traveler: Paimon, you give it a shot.
Paimon: You think Paimon knows how to do that stuff?
Albedo: That was your best effort? Hmm... Well, can't be helped, I suppose.
Traveler: I drank my fill, thanks...
Traveler: Your things aren't very organized.
Albedo: Hmm, agreed. I'd love to find a moment to put them all in order. Still, experiments come first...

## Talk 5

Albedo: That was fast! Looking forward to tasting — I mean, testing — the results...

## Talk 6

Albedo: Mm! An average outcome experimentally, but you've really brought out the flavor. You seem well-versed in the science of gastronomy.
Albedo: As far as the proliferation hypothesis is concerned, we've come up short. Seems like food presents the same headaches in your world as it does ours.
Albedo: Unless... Could it be that the natural laws of this world are limiting your unique abilities?
Paimon: We just didn't know how to channel elemental power into the food. It's a little more complicated than adding herbs and spices, y'know!
Albedo: Not to worry, at least we put some food to good use, no need to feel disheartened.
Albedo: And here's your portion, enjoy! I can box it up if you like.
Paimon: Woohoo, thanks! Glad you were paying attention.
Traveler: You're Paimon's new favorite.
Albedo: I can tell that you're good friends. Paimon was keeping an eye on you and your safety during the whole experiment.
Albedo: Not that Paimon would have been able to do much if things had gone wrong, but anyway...
Paimon: Hey! You were being nice a second ago!
Paimon: But you do have tasty recipes, so Paimon forgives you.
Paimon: And you're right, we are good friends. You have good friends too, right? Good students?
Albedo: ...Uh, yes! I'm fortunate too, I suppose. Anyway, moving on to the next experiment.
Albedo: There are all manner of alchemical items here, keeping them in their proper place is a challenge at the best of times. A while ago, I had the misfortune of misplacing a batch.
Albedo: I managed to retrieve the majority, but two vials have been evading me: Anemo Crystalfly elemental extract and Electro Hypostasis powder.
Paimon: Paimon's barely finished eating and you want us to go gathering again?
Albedo: Don't worry if you can't locate them. I was planning to replace them anyway, though finding them would save me the hassle.
Albedo: If you had, say, a "superpower," like night vision, or vibratory sensing, lost property would be a thing of the past.
Albedo: I must have dropped them somewhere in the area where you were looking just now.
Paimon: So... guess we'd better take a look?
Traveler: There should be some elemental traces on the lost items.
Paimon: Oh yeah! You could use Elemental Sight!
Traveler: Not often that Paimon gets this much attention.

## Talk 7

Albedo: Hmm, an average outcome for a fine dish.
Albedo: As far as the proliferation hypothesis is concerned, we've come up short. Seems like food presents the same headaches in your world as it does ours.
Albedo: Unless... Could it be that the natural laws of this world are limiting your unique abilities?
Paimon: We just didn't know how to channel elemental power into the food. It's a little more complicated than adding herbs and spices, y'know!

## Talk 8

Albedo: Hmm, an interesting term... Compelling.
Albedo: See what you can find, I'll be over here.

## Talk 9

Albedo: Goodness, you managed to find them? Incredible, a thousand thanks.
Albedo: I'm wondering, this Elemental Sight... This is what allowed you to locate the items, and find me here in the mountains, correct?
Paimon: Yup! Guess it does sorta count as a superpower, huh...
Albedo: Unfortunately, though Elemental Sight is seldom seen, it is not unheard of in Teyvat.
Albedo: Only a never-before-seen, otherworldly power would be of benefit to my research.
Paimon: You mean... We failed again...?
Albedo: Don't be disheartened, this falls entirely within my expectations. Besides, getting these items back? I'd call this a very worthwhile experiment.
Albedo: I have to commend your deduction that the items would contain elemental traces.
Albedo: Right then. Up until now, our research has focused on your otherworldly identity. Our research on your identity as one of us is just beginning.
Traveler: With you to the end.
Albedo: In essence, the differences between humans are reflected in our intellectual and physical capabilities. Let's start with physical.
Albedo: Looking out from where we're standing, can you see what Sucrose is doing?
Traveler: Nope.
Albedo: And if you jumped from here and landed on that cliff — the one over there — could you see her then?
Traveler: Nope.
Albedo: So what about if you planted a single blow on the mountain face here and it burst into a million fragments? Then could you see her?
Traveler: Nope.
Albedo: Hmm, then I shouldn't get too excited. Still, we'll gain a more thorough understanding with an experiment.
Albedo: I know of a location that will be perfect for a physical test. Please, follow me.
Traveler: Sounds like we're still on the superpower test.
Traveler: ...How do I get off this train?
