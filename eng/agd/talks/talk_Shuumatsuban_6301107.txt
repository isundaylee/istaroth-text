Traveler: Shuumatsuban?
Nakanishi: Haha, I would be remiss not to mention my grand history if we're going to be talking about that!
Nakanishi: Back in the day, I was an instructor at the ninja village. No one dared to not greet me when they saw me. Taroumaru followed me around back then as well. We served the Kamisato Clan loyally together...
Nakanishi: Now that both of us have retired, I'm not sure if they can still count on those young'uns... Hehe.
Nakanishi: They're probably still expecting me to give them a score, I'll bet...
