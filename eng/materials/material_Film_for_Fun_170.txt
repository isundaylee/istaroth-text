# Film for Fun

Souvenir coins shaped like film slides. These are mementos that can be accumulated and won through participation in the Fontinalia Film Festival. These cannot be placed within specialized devices to play exciting films, sure, but their unique designs are sure to lift peoples' spirits with reminders of what they saw during that festival...
These can be exchanged for valuable rewards during the "Roses and Muskets" event.
