# Shadow of the Past


## Talk 1

Paimon: So this is what Master Jean meant by "difficult to get along with"?
Paimon: *sigh* Let's head back and talk things over with her.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Who would've guessed the Knights have a member of the Lawrence Clan...
Paimon: Well, if you want to learn about the conduct of the Lawrence clan, who better to ask than one of their own family members?

## Talk 3

Paimon: Huh, the Fatui? What are they doing here! Is that why Eula was sent on patrol here?
Paimon: Ugh... let's fight first and talk later!

## Talk 4

Eula (???): You don't think twice before reaching for your sword, do you? Ugh... do you have any idea how long I've been tracking these targets?
Eula (???): ...And now you get to stake a claim. Hmph, you think you're stronger because you got to them first? Ugh... mark my words, vengeance will be mine!
Paimon: ...Uh, what?
Traveler: I'm sorry, vengeance?
Eula (???): That's right. I heard the commotion and came as swiftly as I could, only to find you two already fighting the Fatui. Not only that, you were making quick work of them, too!
Eula (???): If I didn't make my move, you would have been able to take all the credit!
Eula (???): Still, I'm glad you're unscathed. Confronting that number of Fatui at once can be dangerous.
Traveler: Actually, I'm quite used to fighting the Fatui.
Paimon: Uh... Sorry, Paimon doesn't understand what you mean... but thanks for your concern.
Eula (???): Concern? Why would I be concerned for the safety of my arch-enemies?
Paimon: "Arch-enemies"? Wait a minute! You were saying how glad you were that we were "unscathed" a second ago!
Eula (???): By which I meant, if you were injured, I'd have to escort two strangers guilty of stealing my targets all the way back to Mondstadt...
Eula (???): Which would mean you'd caused me even more trouble... my vengeance would be swifter still!
Paimon: Huh? So that's how you see all this!
Traveler: So you must be Eula?
Eula: Yes, that's me.
Paimon: Paimon thinks she's pretty strange... Although, at least we can communicate with her.
Eula: You dare to call someone you've just met "strange"? Forget the aristocracy, that's rude even by normal standards!
Eula: Speaking of which... how do you know my name?
Paimon: This is the Honorary Knight of the Knights of Favonius. And speaking of rude, we're trying to investigate an aristocrat named Schubert Lawrence.
Paimon: He's so obsessed with etiquette that he's not even willing to speak with us!
Eula: Hahaha! I understand now. That's my uncle alright.
Eula: But why do you mean to investigate him?
Traveler: He may be secretly involved with the Fatui.
Eula: I see... Haha, you have some nerve defaming a family member right in front of me. I will have vengeance for this, too!
Paimon: No, no, no! This is an assignment from Master Jean! It's just an investigation, that's all!
Traveler: Aren't you curious about your uncle?
Eula: To the everyday citizens of Mondstadt, everyone in the Lawrence clan is scum. It's natural for rumors and unwarranted gossip to lead to such suspicion.
Paimon: Hard to avoid such a reputation when you're known as the ruthless rulers of Old Mondstadt.
Eula: So that's what you think of me? Yet another transgression to avenge...
Paimon: But didn't you say it first!? Argh...
Eula: Hahaha, curious... We've only just met, and you've already given me three causes for vengeance. It's been a while since I've encountered anyone as interesting as you.
Traveler: Your definition of curious is... curious.
Eula: I assume you need me to teach you the conduct of the Lawrence clan. Only then will you finally be able to communicate with my uncle, correct?
Paimon: That's right, Amber told us to come and talk to you.
Eula: Well then, let's begin your training immediately. It'll be easier to train when we're back in Mondstadt, we'll require other people.
Traveler: But aren't you plotting vengeance against us?
Eula: We can put that aside for now. Besides, if it's the Acting Grand Master's assignment, and Amber's the one who recommended me, I should comply.
Traveler: You're not planning to take revenge at an opportune moment, are you?
Traveler: Why do you seem so happy about it?
Traveler: Aren't you worried about your uncle?
Traveler: I know my way around a fight.

## Talk 5

Jean: Schubert can be quite touchy, so it may not be easy to get along with him at first.
Jean: But as long as matters remain calm, then you should be able to come to friendly terms with him.

## Talk 6

Traveler: About Schubert...
Hertha: You mean that weird old aristocrat? I'm afraid I haven't seen him.
Hertha: Members of the Lawrence Clan don't usually appear in front of the Knights of Favonius of their own accord.
Hertha: Which is just as well. It would be a bother if it ended up affecting our logistical preparations.
Hertha: Head up and have a look. Who knows, you might just find him.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Hello, have you seen an aristocrat by the name of Schubert anywhere nearby?
Michelle: Hmm, the name doesn't ring a bell, but there has been an odd fellow strolling around here recently.
Michelle: He's always looking around, and sometimes he seems to stop to draw or note something down. To be honest, I've got no idea what he's up to.
Michelle: If that sounds like the person you're looking for, just head towards the city wall and you'll most likely run into him.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Amber: Head to the Stormbearer Mountains â€” you should be able to find Eula there!
Amber: She's a great friend of mine. She'll help you for sure.
