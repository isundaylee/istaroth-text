# In a New Light


## Talk 1

Sigewinne: Please come with me to the infirmary.
Sigewinne: Ah, and watch your step. There are some pretty dark areas, so make sure you don't trip over anything.

## Talk 2

Monglane: It's Monsieur Neuvillette!

## Talk 3

Gordes: Did Neuvillette just walk by?

## Talk 4

Millereau: We just had a new member join us last month...

## Talk 5

Auriol: Now that I think about it, I can leave this place soon... Huh?

## Talk 6

Paimon: We should've gathered enough information! Let's head back and talk to Neuvillette!

## Talk 7

Neuvillette: That trial is something I rarely bring up in conversation, but I've always felt deep regret for what happened to both Carole and Vautrin.
Neuvillette: The words he spoke in court often replay in my mind, as if urging me on to do something...
Paimon: But Wriothesley said he never resented you, right? Isn't that a good thing?
Neuvillette: I believe I now understand what he wanted to tell me.
Neuvillette: I feel conflicted about those words. How should I describe it... Surprise, relief, fear, and regret... But this blend of emotions has led me to finally understand some things.
Neuvillette: I would like to hear your thoughts, too. What do you think of me?

## Talk 8

Gordes: Anything you need?
Traveler: The badge you're wearing...
Gordes: Oh, this? Are you interested in joining the Mutual Aid Network?
Paimon: What's that?
Gordes: We have a very long history, going back as far as four hundred years ago.
Gordes: We have never had many members throughout our history, nor do we have much of a reputation... But everyone treats each other like family.
Gordes: Helping each other is our purpose. At the same time, we seek to maintain just dealings as much as possible.
Paimon: Sounds like a pretty neat organization!
Gordes: Haha, all we want is to defend ourselves. None of us have ever committed serious crimes, and we're not especially powerful either. We're at a natural disadvantage here in the Fortress.
Gordes: But people won't give us a hard time if we stick together.

## Talk 9

Gordes: Anything you need?
Traveler: The badge you're wearing...
Gordes: Oh, this? Are you interested in joining the Mutual Aid Network?
Paimon: The Mutual Aid Network? Don't tell Paimon you're another shady organization like the Beret Society...
Gordes: The Beret Society... Oh, you mean the group that was dissolved a while back? Rest assured, we're completely different.
Paimon: Okay then. What does your network usually do?
Gordes: We have a very long history, going back as far as four hundred years ago.
Gordes: We have never had many members throughout our history, nor do we have much of a reputation... But everyone treats each other like family.
Gordes: Helping each other is our purpose. At the same time, we seek to maintain just dealings as far much possible.
Paimon: Sounds like a pretty neat organization!
Gordes: Haha, all we want is to defend ourselves. None of us have ever committed serious crimes, and we're not especially powerful either. We're at a natural disadvantage here in the Fortress.
Gordes: But people won't give us a hard time if we stick together.

## Talk 10

Millereau: Interested in joining the Mutual Aid Network?
Millereau: If you'd like to learn more, here's our flyer.
Millereau: Our slogan may have evolved over the centuries, but our goal has remained unchanged.
Millereau: Here, this book is for you. You're welcome to come and sign up anytime.

## Talk 11

Auriol: Hmm... You two look kinda familiar...
Traveler: The badge you're wearing...
Auriol: It's the symbol of the Mutual Aid Network, designed by our first president.
Auriol: From what I've heard, it's based on something called a Medal of Peace. I've never seen one of those medals for myself, though.
Traveler: Medal of Peace?
Auriol: The first president of our network was an amazing person. Powerful as he was, he never used his strength against anyone. He encouraged the weaker criminals to stick together and look out for each other.
Auriol: ...All of us have a lot of respect for him.

## Talk 12

Wriothesley: Troubles are an inevitable part of life, but it seems like the Chief Justice has had more of them than most.

## Talk 13

Gordes: Recently, a criminal named Domenico attempted to incite the other criminals to rebel against Neuvillette.
Gordes: We of the Mutual Aid Network couldn't just stand there and watch, so we stepped in and taught him a lesson.

## Talk 14

Millereau: What do you think? Interested in joining?

## Talk 15

Wriothesley: Allow me to introduce this... fine gentleman, Domenico.
Wriothesley: Why don't you explain everything to him?
Domenico: N—Neuvillette!?
Domenico: What do you want? What are you gonna do, kill me?
Neuvillette: Calm down. I merely wanted to ask you a few questions.
Neuvillette: Was it your idea to send that letter to a Melusine?
Domenico: ...
Neuvillette: Esseim has already confessed, so there really isn't any need to keep hiding.
Domenico: That idiot... I can't believe I trusted him!
Neuvillette: Let me ask this another way: It was your idea to send that threat letter, correct?
Domenico: ...Yes.
Neuvillette: Who is pulling your strings?
Domenico: What?
Domenico: Y—You're not trying to frame me for something I haven't done, are you?
Neuvillette: ...
Wriothesley: It's best if you realize the gravity of your situation. The Chief Justice of Fontaine has been personally investigating your case.
Wriothesley: I assume your previous attempt to incite unrest at the Fortress of Meropide has something to do with this as well.
Domenico: I... I admit I acted on impulse... I'll tell you the truth... but before that, you must ensure my safety.
Neuvillette: I can do that.
Wriothesley: You see? We're all reasonable people here.
Domenico: I only intended to do some small business at first. Someone contacted me about delivering some goods and promised me a generous sum of Mora in return.
Domenico: After making a few trips, I was suddenly approached by the Marechaussee Phantom... They accused me of smuggling prohibited items, and I was put on trial—
Domenico: But I refuse to accept any of that. The ignorant can be rightfully absolved from guilt, right? Well, I suspect that someone got me locked up here so they could get their hands on my goods...
Neuvillette: ...
Wriothesley: ...
Paimon: And then you decided to take revenge on the Melusines... over that?
Traveler: Ignorance is not an excuse, by the way.
Domenico: My initial target was Neuvillette. Everyone in the Fortress of Meropide was declared guilty by him, after all, so they must more or less hold a grudge against him, right? If I could get them to strike back...
Domenico: But for some reason, no one wanted to team up with me. That... Mutual Aid Network, in particular. What did those nobodies even gain from trying to challenge me, seriously...
Domenico: In the end, I had to redirect my focus onto Melusines to salvage things.
Domenico: I recalled that Kiara was the one who confiscated my goods for inspection, so I asked one of the more approachable guards to send a letter, claiming that I meant to contact my family...
Domenico: But the letter was in fact addressed to Esseim. I requested that he write a threat letter to Kiara and force her to resign from the Marechaussee Phantom...
Neuvillette: Am I to assume that the claims you've made are your own thoughts? Have you been in contact with any suspicious people recently?
Domenico: No.
Neuvillette: Is it true that all members involved in the smuggling scandal have been caught?
Domenico: Yes... and that's all I know.
Neuvillette: ...
Wriothesley: Sigewinne, please take him back to the detention center. I'll deal with him later.
Wriothesley: So, Monsieur Neuvillette, you were concerned that there might be a shadowy faction looking to capitalize on the delicate situation with the Melusines to stir up greater chaos?
Neuvillette: Yes. I experienced a similar incident in the past, so I had to be prepared for any possibility.
Wriothesley: And how long ago was this incident?
Neuvillette: More than four hundred years.
Wriothesley: You might be overthinking this.
Wriothesley: Time can change a lot of things. Everything's different now.
Neuvillette: What do you mean?
Wriothesley: Four hundred years ago, you and the Melusines you brought to Fontaine were the outliers in society.
Wriothesley: But in the present day, if someone were to threaten the safety of the Melusines, people wouldn't just sit back and do nothing. I trust that they would make different choices from before.
Paimon: That's right! We saw lots of people standing up for Melusines on our way back to the Palais Mermonia!
Wriothesley: Monsieur Neuvillette, the Melusines are a species you introduced to Fontaine. How the public treats them is also reflective of their attitude towards you.
Wriothesley: When people refused to place their trust in Melusines, it was because they were still on the fence about you — their unfamiliar Chief Justice.
Wriothesley: For almost five hundred years, you've conducted every trial with impartiality. You made the right judgment each time regardless of whatever nonsense went on.
Wriothesley: People no longer have any reservations about you and even consider you a symbol of the law.
Wriothesley: Right now, your every decision will impact all of Fontaine. In other words, you've gradually transformed the whole nation.
Paimon: Paimon gets it now. No wonder no one wanted to join forces with Domenico...
Traveler: Tragedies like that won't ever happen again.
Neuvillette: I am undeserving of such high compliments. From my perspective, I have simply been fulfilling my duties.
Neuvillette: It isn't anything special or worthy of praise. I'm simply fulfilling the promises I've made and searching for answers through my judgments.
Neuvillette: It's unnecessary to hold me in such high regard... The complexity of human emotions and willpower far exceed those of mine. As a matter of fact, I believe that you are the ones who deserve my respect.
Wriothesley: Ah, there's no need to be so modest. The current state of affairs says it all.
Wriothesley: You're no longer that outsider you were before. Even if you wished to investigate something on your own, many would take the initiative to lend you a hand.
Neuvillette: I must say that you've made a fair point.
Neuvillette: Thank you for clearing my doubts. Now that the case has been settled, I should get going.
Paimon: Huh? You're leaving?
Wriothesley: And so soon, too? Why not stay for a cup of tea?
Neuvillette: Thank you for the offer, but I know how this place works all too well.
Neuvillette: While some are here to redeem themselves, there will inevitably be those who harbor resentment towards me.
Neuvillette: The less time I spend here, the better. My presence could very well result in an unwanted disturbance.
Wriothesley: In that case, I'll have to insist. I still have two more things to say.
Neuvillette: Please go ahead.
Wriothesley: The first is about the guard who helped Domenico send that letter...
Neuvillette: Ah, I know of what you speak.
Neuvillette: The guard was indeed deployed from the Palais Mermonia's staff. However, as I mentioned earlier, I visited today on personal business. Therefore, I leave that matter in your hands.
Wriothesley: Well, that makes things a lot easier.
Traveler: You're not going to...
Wriothesley: Hey now, don't let your imagination run wild.
Wriothesley: Those from up there have a tendency to sympathize with others. However, down here, such thoughts will put you at high risk.
Wriothesley: I'll have a chat with the guard and remind him to take precautions in the future.
Neuvillette: I see no issues with that.
Paimon: Great, that's one thing out of the way! What's the other thing you wanted to say?
Wriothesley: The other thing was born from my own sense of curiosity. Now, I've heard that you investigated the Mutual Aid Network. Is that right?
Paimon: Yep. Neuvillette thought their badges looked familiar...
Wriothesley: I noticed the small gang as well, when I first took over the Fortress of Meropide. They were not great in number, but every member always made sure to stand up for what was right.
Wriothesley: I've looked into their founder — Vautrin — who once stood trial and was sentenced to imprisonment in the Fortress.
Wriothesley: According to existing documentation, Vautrin remained disciplined throughout his imprisonment. He had never once engaged in physical or verbal aggression.
Wriothesley: In other words, how he presented himself in prison was very different from his behavior in court.
Neuvillette: What?
Traveler: Doesn't he hate Neuvillette?
Neuvillette: During his trial, I could sense that his feelings were complicated. He appeared to be full of resentment, and I believed he had every right to feel that way.
Wriothesley: Perhaps he had been putting on an act.
Paimon: An act?
Wriothesley: Neuvillette and Vautrin had a close relationship as superior and subordinate. Vautrin must've known that the Chief Justice would make an impartial judgment.
Wriothesley: Thus, the more resentment he displayed, the clearer it would be to those present that you were upholding justice.
Wriothesley: And to those who had been sitting on the fence, Vautrin's act was a very meaningful one.
Neuvillette: ...
Wriothesley: That's all from me. Does anyone else have anything to say? Now's your chance.
Neuvillette: I don't have anything to say — apart from expressing my gratitude, that is.
Neuvillette: Well then, let us head back. No need to see us off.
Wriothesley: Please take care.
Traveler: You're hopeless.

## Talk 16

Auriol: I had many grievances about my situation before joining the network. I knew that I had committed crimes, yes, but that alone didn't stop life here from being miserable.
Auriol: But look at me now! Chatting with my friends, doing meaningful things together...

## Talk 17

Neuvillette: Did you manage to gather any intel?
Paimon: The people who wore the badges belong to an organization called the Mutual Aid Network.
Paimon: According to them, the badge's design was inspired by the Medal of Peace. Have you seen any of those before?
Neuvillette: I personally crafted two of them myself. They were awarded to Carole and Vautrin.
Neuvillette: Carole's medal was destroyed in a fire. The only one that remained should belong to Vautrin.
Paimon: Oh...
Paimon: So the network was inspired by...
Sigewinne: Monsieur Neuvillette, His Grace has requested your presence in his office. He's found Domenico.
Neuvillette: ...Alright. Let us talk to him first and get to the bottom of this situation.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Navia: Please escort the remaining guests back to the Fleuve Cendre. I appreciate your help!
Tetreaux (Tetreaux & Faustier): Yes, boss.

### Additional Talk 2

Oudinot: Whew... That was a close call.
Massena: Are we really in the clear, though?

### Additional Talk 3

Arouet: Neuvillette made an appearance in person! This is the perfect chance to make a name for myself.
Arouet: Hmm... But how should I make the most of this and get the word out...

### Additional Talk 4

Paimon: Paimon agrees with everything Wriothesley said.
Paimon: #As Chief Justice, every single one of your trials makes an impact on Fontaine... What do you think, Traveler?
Paimon: #Heyyy, Traveler! Any comments?
Traveler: What I really think is...
Traveler: Every trial you've ever judged has left its impression on you. And that's what makes you who you are today.
Traveler: (As the Hydro Dragon Sovereign, Neuvillette still thinks of himself as an outsider due to his identity...)
Traveler: (But so much time has passed since then... Perhaps the lines between him and humans have long since blurred.)
Neuvillette: ...That is indeed a reasonable assumption.
Neuvillette: As I said, I find it difficult to express my emotions... because I cannot fully understand myself.
Neuvillette: But I trust your judgment. Since some time ago, I've begun to notice the changes that have occurred upon my person.
Neuvillette: These changes were not due to any specific occurrence, but emerged as a result of time itself.
Neuvillette: I will try to contemplate this further. Thank you both.

### Additional Talk 5

Charlotte: An exclusive interview! Am I dreaming...? What should I ask him?
Navia: Don't let anything hold you back. Make the most of this opportunity and ask away!
Clorinde: I agree. He'll decline any question he can't answer anyway, so you might as well give all of them a shot.

### Additional Talk 6

Livre: Charlotte's voice never fails to carry through the walls. I have no idea what's going on, but it sounds like something good's happened.
Xugney: Everyone seems to be in good spirits. This truly is a wonderful day...

### Additional Talk 7

Kiara: Zzz...
Neuvillette: Kiara?
Kiara: Ah, Monsieur Neuvillette? Sorry, I accidentally fell asleep.
Neuvillette: It's alright. I'm here to tell you that we've caught the sender of that threatening letter. You're safe now.
Kiara: Thank you, Monsieur.
Kiara: #And thank you too, Traveler and Big Sis Paimon. Everyone's been so nice to me, so I've always felt really safe.
Neuvillette: Do you remember Domenico? He was the sender of that letter.
Kiara: Let me think... I can't remember. My memory isn't that good, so I easily forget things...
Kiara: By the way, I saw Carole in my dreams just now. Hmm... where's she gone, by the way? I haven't seen her in a long time.
Paimon: ...
Kiara: In my dream, she looked really happy. She held my hand and said: "Kiara, our dreams have finally come true!"
Kiara: I can't remember what our dreams were anymore, and I don't know why, but I felt really happy too.
Neuvillette: I can sense your joy. It is indeed a delightful moment.
Kiara: Hehe... Monsieur Neuvillette, are you happy too?
Kiara: Ooh, I almost forgot! Am I allowed to go out now?
Kiara: I promised to model for Eloffe!
Neuvillette: Of course — off you go.
Kiara: #See you next time, Monsieur, Traveler, and Big Sis Paimon!
Neuvillette: Mm... See you next time.

### Additional Talk 8

Neuvillette: ...
Neuvillette: I really can't fathom what goes on in her head sometimes.

### Additional Talk 9

"Neuvillette's Note": "Away for personal reasons. Will be back in a day."
"Neuvillette's Note" (Furina's Reply): "'Personal reasons'? Oh me, oh my, has our Chief Justice finally come to his senses?"
"Neuvillette's Note" (Furina's Reply): "If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times — You should follow my example and go out more often. You need to get to know your people better!"
"Neuvillette's Note" (Furina's Reply): "Even if something unfortunate happens, you'll still run into lots of unique characters along the way."
"Neuvillette's Note" (Furina's Reply): "What do you think? The human world isn't too bad, now is it?"

### Additional Talk 10

Clorinde: Is the matter resolved?
Paimon: Yup! We found the person who sent that threatening letter. Wriothesley told us he'd keep a close eye on him, so the Melusines should be safe now.
Navia: Oh, that's wonderful!
Neuvillette: Sorry for dragging you all into this.
Clorinde: There's no need to apologize.
Navia: Yeah, you didn't drag us in. We got involved of our own accord.
Paimon: By the way, where's Kiara?
Clorinde: At the Palais Mermonia. More than fifty people offered to protect her — some even hid within the bushes to look out for danger.
Clorinde: I was worried that the excess of protection would make her feel uneasy, so I asked her to stay inside the Palais. It's very safe in there.
Paimon: Phew, what a relief!
Charlotte: Well now, it looks like the dust has finally settled!
Charlotte: To celebrate this joyous occasion... Monsieur Neuvillette, would you be interested in an exclusive interview?
Paimon: That's not how you celebrate!
Neuvillette: I will consider it.
Charlotte: *gasp* Really!?
Neuvillette: Of course. My schedule is full for the following weeks, but I should be available next month.
Neuvillette: Come up with questions during the intervening days, and I will answer them to the best of my ability.
Charlotte: ...
Charlotte: ...
Charlotte: Yes! Thank you so much, Monsieur!
Neuvillette: Now, if you'll excuse me, I must head back to the Palais and issue a communique to publicize our investigation results.
Neuvillette: I hope it will assuage the concerns of all.

### Additional Talk 11

Neuvillette: I once thought that time was of no consequence to me.
Neuvillette: Distance yourself from others and stay focused on your work. A few years or a few hundred... it's all the same.
Neuvillette: But... after all this, I've realized that perhaps this way of thinking is fundamentally flawed.
Neuvillette: The passing of time has its own consequences. The answer that I've been searching for amongst all those lives... perhaps it's life itself.
