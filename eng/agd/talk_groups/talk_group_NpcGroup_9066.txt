## Talk

Kamisato Ayato: #Hello, Traveler.
Kamisato Ayato: Good timing. I have a job that needs doing, and you are the only one who can do it.
Kamisato Ayato: ...Hehe, just wanted to see how you'd react.

## Talk

Traveler: Are you settling in okay?
Kamisato Ayato: Most definitely.
Kamisato Ayato: I have seen furnishings like these plenty of times before, though I don't believe I've seen them arranged in this particular fashion.
Kamisato Ayato: The layout is clearly inspired and thoroughly distinctive... Simply marvelous.
Kamisato Ayato: In fact, I'm inclined to have the Yashiro Commission headquarters remodeled in this style.
Kamisato Ayato: Would you object to overseeing the project and making sure everything is to the right specifications?
Traveler: I feel like you're probably joking...?
Kamisato Ayato: Ah, what gave it away? My acting skills appear to have deteriorated.
Kamisato Ayato: In any case, this place is refreshingly different.
Kamisato Ayato: You may find me visiting you here quite often.
Traveler: Uh... I don't think that's a good idea.
Kamisato Ayato: Heh, why the pained expression?
Kamisato Ayato: Well, if it's really that much trouble, I won't force it.

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Kamisato Ayato: If you wish to chat, then by all means, let's chat. What's on your mind?
Traveler: How's work in the Yashiro Commission?
Kamisato Ayato: I had thought you'd be inquiring about more personal matters.
Kamisato Ayato: Heh, you don't need to worry about me being overworked.
Kamisato Ayato: Case in point — I still have the energy to chat with you here.
Traveler: But don't you find the work draining?
Kamisato Ayato: People tend to find work draining if they haven't yet discovered what they are trying to protect.
Kamisato Ayato: I, at least, don't have this problem.
Traveler: Well, hats off to you.
Kamisato Ayato: I am flattered beyond belief to receive your praise and concern for my well-being.
Kamisato Ayato: But you needn't worry. At present, there is no one more suitable than I to be in the position of Yashiro Commissioner.
Traveler: But don't you think there's too much to do?
Kamisato Ayato: Oh, you mean my workload? Yes, it's rather enormous. But there's nothing that can be done about that.
Kamisato Ayato: All I can do is try to work through each item as intelligently as possible.
Traveler: How's life in the Yashiro Commission?
Kamisato Ayato: Life? ...Once work is accounted for, precious little time remains to allocate to my personal life.
Kamisato Ayato: If this is something that concerns you, I see a simple solution: you can be my valet.
Kamisato Ayato: My diet and other day-to-day needs will be your responsibility.
Kamisato Ayato: Oh... as far as diet is concerned, I'm not a picky eater. And as for everything else... No, actually I don't think I have any peculiar habits that you need to be aware of.
Kamisato Ayato: Though if you ever discover anything that tastes new and different, bring some back for me too.
Traveler: For example, strange new dishes?
Kamisato Ayato: Hmm... yes, why not. Worth a try.
Traveler: ...Oh, you're actually being serious this time.
Kamisato Ayato: Indeed, I am.
Kamisato Ayato: It's entirely up to you. Take your time and give it some thought. Consider it an ongoing discussion.
Traveler: For example, new kinds of milk tea?
Kamisato Ayato: Precisely. I'm looking forward to it already.

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Kamisato Ayato: #Have you ever taken a dog for a walk, Traveler?
Traveler: ...Taken a dog for a walk?
Kamisato Ayato: Yes. Where you stroll together with a canine companion.
Kamisato Ayato: Dogs are instinctually loyal. But no matter how well-behaved a dog might be, it gets unhappy if it's cooped up in the same place for too long.
Kamisato Ayato: Bringing it outdoors and watching it run free and enjoy itself is a splendid way to relax. It puts you in a good mood.
Kamisato Ayato: Don't you want to try?
Traveler: I'm a little nervous...
Kamisato Ayato: Don't worry. My staff will be sure to pick out a sufficiently docile dog for you.
Kamisato Ayato: Failing that... There's always Taroumaru.
Traveler: Alright, I guess I can give it a try.
Kamisato Ayato: Alright then. If you have any reservations starting out, we can treat this as a practice area.
Kamisato Ayato: Once you've reached the point where you're able to enjoy it, we can head out onto the streets.
Kamisato Ayato: Drinking some milk tea and walking the dogs... I wouldn't be surprised if it causes some commotion.
Kamisato Ayato: Heh, not that I mind, of course.
Traveler: Sure!
Kamisato Ayato: Heh, raring to go, I see.

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Ayato.
Kamisato Ayato: #Good morning, Traveler.
Kamisato Ayato: Shall we have breakfast together? I'll have my staff prepare something.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodnight, Ayato.
Kamisato Ayato: #Good night, Traveler.
Kamisato Ayato: Relax and sleep well. Nobody would dare disturb you.

## Talk

Kamisato Ayato: Ah... this reminds me of when Ayaka was young, and we would visit the festival together...
Kamisato Ayato: It's immaculate. Even I, as Yashiro Commissioner, cannot find any fault with the way you have designed this place.
Kamisato Ayato: Since it's just the two of us here... shall we take a stroll together?

## Talk

Kamisato Ayato: This is a truly exceptional design. The architectural style borrows from the Tri-Commission mansions, and the general arrangement is very aesthetically pleasing.
Kamisato Ayato: The familiar environment makes me feel right at home, and good company only adds to the exquisiteness of the occasion.
Kamisato Ayato: Hmm, truly delightful.
