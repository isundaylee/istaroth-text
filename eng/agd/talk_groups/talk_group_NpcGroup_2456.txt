Traveler: How are the people at the Jade Chamber doing?

Traveler: What about the Jade Chamber?
Bu'yun: Sadly, the Jade Chamber, which once blotted out the sun and moon, has now been swallowed up by the waves of the Sea of Clouds.
Bu'yun: They say that seasons come and seasons go, and that all things must rise and fall. Thus it is with the ancient gods, and so it is with mortal works. There is nothing there to mourn.
Bu'yun: So they say. But still, I cannot help but sigh when I consider the fate of the Jade Chamber...
Bu'yun: To sacrifice the work she had carved with her own hands over so many years...
Bu'yun: And to do so without hesitation or regrets...
Bu'yun: Lady Ningguang's stratagems are beyond my ability to grasp...
