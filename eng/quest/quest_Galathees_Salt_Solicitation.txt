# Galathee's Salt Solicitation


## Talk 1

Traveler: About Salt...
Galathee: Hello. Are you here to discuss matters related to the supply of salt?
Galathee: Then you must have a lot of salt prepared, right?
Traveler: Salt is ready.
Traveler: Not yet.
Galathee: It won't do to be without salt. Every time our ship sets sail, we need to stockpile enough salt for our journey.

## Talk 2

Galathee: The current amount should be enough for a short voyage. You seem pretty reliable. If I have any needs like this in the future, you'll be the first one I contact.
