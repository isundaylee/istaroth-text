Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Sky-blue seas, milk-white hot springs, ash-grey mountain rock... The colors of nature reflect the vistas of the world. They teach us down-to-earth artistry."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "But life is not unchanging! Sometimes, what you need is excitement beyond the pale! And you â€” yes you, filled as you are with creativity... Do you not yearn to unleash the colorful ideas that spring to life in your head?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Join us! Join the Graffiti Alliance. Grab your spray cans, and create untold masterpieces alongside us!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Our goal is to take every last cliff in Natlan, every last giant rock, every last flat wall, and fill them with the trendiest, most avant-garde graffiti. We'll hit 'em with more new art than they can swing a talking stick at!"
