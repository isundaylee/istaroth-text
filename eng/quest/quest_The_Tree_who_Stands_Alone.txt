# The Tree who Stands Alone


## Talk 1

Lost Notes: "...The tree who stands alone has no forest to call his home... But the sturdy rock has a heart of gold, unite and you shall share in its blessings... This fortune hereby made known unto you, I say: honor the will of your father..."

## Talk 2

Yuan Qing: Oh no! What did I do to deserve this...
Yuan Qing: I finally managed to slip away while they weren't watching so that I could be first to get to the mine and find the treasure... But where did all these monsters come from!?
Yuan Qing: I'm done for...

## Talk 3

Yuan Cheng: Hmph, lousy older brothers! All they care about is taking the best finds for themselves.
Yuan Cheng: And dad's losing it in his old age... either completely oblivious, or just happy to turn a blind eye...
Yuan Cheng: I don't think they've realized yet that the treasure's in the mine.
Yuan Cheng: I've gotta get my hands on it... and then get as far away from here as possible!

## Talk 4

Yuan Liang: Hehehe... The treasure will be mine!
Yuan Liang: My brothers are such morons... They ran off after grasping a couple of lines thinking they'd figured it out. Hehehe...
Yuan Liang: Honor father's will? Bah! There was one line worth reading in that thing, and that was the part about the treasure being in the mine. Speaking of mine... Soon it will all be mine! Hehehe...

## Talk 5

Yuan Hong: They've left... They've all left...
Yuan Hong: Yuan Qing, Yuan Liang, Yuan Cheng... You foolish children. You'll have to think a bit more carefully and look harder than you are doing now...

## Talk 6

Paimon: Hey, look! It's those guys from earlier.
Yuan Qing: The tree who stands alone has no forest to call his home... Haha, it's true, you can't achieve anything by yourself...
Yuan Cheng: The splendid red autumnal leaves, part ways though there be no breeze... If I could take my brothers and father at their word...
Yuan Liang: The glorious red autumnal leaves, part ways on a passing breeze... The treasure... Lost everything, all because of the treasure...
Yuan Hong: Trees should blend their roots and shade, for that is where the home is made... Children, we're supposed to be a family...
Yuan Hong: You seriously thought I hid treasure in the mine? ... *sigh*
Yuan Hong: There is a treasure, though... Do you still remember the tree we planted together as a family when you were children?
Yuan Hong: I come here every year and put a little something inside, hoping that when you're older we can dig it out together.
Yuan Hong: And then use it to buy some treats and a bottle of wine... celebrate together, as a family... talk about the old times...
Yuan Hong: Oh children, my dear children...

## Talk 7

Yuan Hong: The tree who stands alone has no forest to call his home...
Traveler: Hello.
Yuan Hong: The splendid red autumnal leaves, parted ways though there be no breeze...
Traveler: Hello! Excuse me!
Yuan Hong: The glorious red autumnal leaves, parted ways on a passing breeze...
Paimon: Why are they ignoring us?
Yuan Hong: Money... riches... It's all a farce. A farce, I say!
Yuan Hong: The further away from this village... the better...
Yuan Hong: If only we could start all over again... From the beginning...
