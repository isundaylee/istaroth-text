# A Gifted Rose: Prickly as Thorns


## Talk 1

Affan: What are you kids doing? Come to laugh at this old man "growing rocks," have you?
Affan: I'm fine! I don't need the other villagers to worry about me.
Paimon: Whoa, no need to be so hostile from the get-go.
Paimon: You're mistaken. We're not from Aaru Village, and we're not here to laugh at you.
Traveler: We're just passing by.
Affan: Passers-by? Uh...
Affan: Normally, only some old friends of mine would come over to tell me to give up on the nursery and move back to the village.
Affan: And a few bad kids too. They keep coming over here to cause trouble.
Affan: It's my first time seeing children dressed up like this. What is it that you do?
Traveler: I'm a traveler looking for my family.
Paimon: Yes, we've traveled a long way for this, and gone through many adventures together.
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}'s a righteous soul through and through.
Paimon: We don't do things like bullying lonely old folks.
Paimon: So there's no need to worry, gramps. We're not bad guys.
Affan: Ahem. How embarrassing, to have to apologize to two children. But I am sorry. I shouldn't have made assumptions.
Affan: Children, please accept my — Affan's — most sincere apologies.
Affan: You children are very capable to be supporting yourselves at such a young age. Quite impressive. Much better than me at your age.
Affan: So based on what you just said, I can request your help when I have a problem that I can't solve, yes?
Paimon: Oh? Do you mean you have a commission for us?
Traveler: What's the problem?
Affan: I originally had two nurseries. One is here, and the other is to the west of the village.
Affan: I've gotten quite old, so it's getting harder for me to tend to both places. I didn't check on the other nursery for just a few days, and it was destroyed by some strange black stuff.
Affan: It's terribly dangerous. Once I went in, I thought I wouldn't be able to come back out. I know better than to try to go in there again.
Affan: My greatest hope now is to restore that nursery so that I can grow flowers there again.
Paimon: #It doesn't sound too complicated. What do you think? Should we accept this commission, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: Sure.
Affan: The nursery is to the west of the village. Don't get lost!
Paimon: No problem! Don't worry about it.
Traveler: I'm an adventurer exploring the world.
Paimon: Yep! We've climbed many, many mountains, and crossed lakes and seas to get to Sumeru.
Paimon: What do you call it? Uh, we're... big-hearted adventurers.
Traveler: I heard that someone's growing flowers here.
Affan: Yeah, I'm growing flowers, not some dumb rocks.
Affan: I thought... Ugh. Never mind, what am I even supposed to say now...

## Talk 2

Affan: You two are back? How is the nursery? Do you think it can be saved?
Traveler: We've taken care of it.
Black Screen Text: You explain the Withering to Affan.
Affan: I see. So that's why. I knew something was off when so much black stuff just appeared out of the ground.
Affan: Good, good. Now I can finally plant some seeds without worries.
Affan: When these three seeds sprout, bloom and produce seeds again, I'll plant them in the ground there. Then the land will be covered with these flowers.
Paimon: Eh? These strangely-shaped rocks...? Can flowers grow out of them?
Paimon: Where did you buy these from, Grandpa Affan? Did you get scammed or something?
Affan: You have good hearts. But don't worry, children. Mora can't buy these flower seeds.
Affan: The old... I mean, a friend of mine gave me these three precious seeds. So of course they are different from normal seedlings.
Paimon: The more Paimon hears about it, the weirder it sounds. Grandpa Affan, just what are you growing?
Affan: Hehe, what I'm planting is a friend's wish.
Paimon: What a strange answer. Can you really plant that sort of thing?
Affan: Child, you wouldn't understand even if I told you. Come visit me again when you get the chance.
Affan: This field might look empty now, but these three seeds will one day sprout and bloom in this nursery.
Affan: There will be more and more of them in the future. Haha, and they will surely create a beautiful scene.
Affan: Alright, alright. Since I asked for your help, I will be sure to compensate you.
Affan: Take this, children. I can't give you much, so this is all.
Paimon: Phew, commission complete! Paimon's a little hungry after all that running around.
Traveler: I was the one running though...
Paimon: Well, Paimon was providing running commentary. That takes energy too!
Paimon: Don't sweat the small stuff! How about we use our payment to buy ourselves a treat, hmm?
Paimon: C'mon, let's see how much we got and how many meals we can buy.
Traveler: Let's see...
Paimon: Ah, most of the stuff here is food instead of Mora... Shawarma, Tahchin, and lots of vegetables.
Paimon: This is way too much. Did we take a whole day's rations away from Grandpa Affan?
Paimon: But he lives alone outside the village. It can't be easy for him, right?
Paimon: Never mind the Mora. If he gave us all his rations, then... It just feels wrong.
Paimon: And he was planting seeds that looked like stones, saying that he was planting... a wish?
Paimon: Is it possible that he's been living on his own for so long that he's started to imagine things?
Paimon: This is worrying. Let's pay him a visit when we can find the time.

## Talk 3

Affan: Ah, I haven't had time to cook yet, so I'm afraid I have nothing with which to receive you as guests.
Traveler: No need.
Affan: So, this other kid is your friend, huh? She's pretty cute.
Affan: Do you want to come see the flowers when they bloom?
Traveler: No problem.
Affan: They will most likely bloom in a few days. Come back later to see the flowers you helped to plant.
Traveler: Okay.
Affan: Alright, I understand.
Affan: ♪...
Traveler: Don't worry, I'm not hungry.
