# Ascension Challenge III


## Talk 1

Traveler: I'm here for the Ascension Challenge!
Prince: Meow... (Hmm? Here for the Ascension Challenge? I see... You are indeed qualified for the challenge. Alright...)
Prince: "I'll have Shuyun set up the challenge for you immediately. Do be careful!"

## Talk 2

Prince: Meow! (How wonderful! Congratulations on completing the Ascension Challenge. You're now a Master player!)
Prince: Meow. (Being a Master player means... that your technique has surpassed that of many people who have been studying the game. Those who don't put in enough effort will never be able to reach such level.)
Prince: (Of course, they fail to understand why we would spend so much time on a game that they just play for fun...)
Prince: Meow! (Should the players invited by you learn that you have obtained the title of Master, they will surely take games against you more seriously.)
Prince: (Perhaps some players are only willing to let you challenge the games set up by them after hearing that you have become a Master player... There are such strange guys in the tavern as well.)
Prince: #Meow... ({NICKNAME}...)
Prince: (May the fun be with you in the world of Genius Invokation TCG!)

## Talk 3

Prince: Meow... (How unfortunate... Try to be extra careful next time and perhaps make some adjustments to your deck before your next attempt.)
Prince: (I believe you are capable of completing this challenge.)
