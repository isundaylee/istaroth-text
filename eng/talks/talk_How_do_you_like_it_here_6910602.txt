Traveler: How do you like it here?
Mavuika: It's great! It feels like a vacation spot, almost like the People of the Springs.
Mavuika: Before I became Pyro Archon, I went to the hot springs all the time. It's the perfect place to unwind and meet people from all walks of life, outlanders included.
Mavuika: But, that kind of free time is few and far between these days.
Traveler: You could always try to find that old feeling again.
Mavuika: Hahaha, I actually prefer to keep busy. Let me put it this way...
Mavuika: I'm sure you've invited many friends here in the past. And like me, they probably walked away with a very positive impression of this place.
Mavuika: From the environment to the decorations, you planned out everything down to the smallest detail.
Mavuika: Behind everything we see here lies a tremendous amount of work. And, you do that work, because this is your home, right?
Mavuika: Collecting ingredients, crafting furnishings, planning the layout and design... I'm sure all of that kept you very busy.
Traveler: Yeah, but it was very fulfilling.
Mavuika: Exactly. That's how I feel about Natlan.
Mavuika: Some bear their responsibilities like a burden, out of a sense of identity or obligation. But, I have a vision, and that is what drives me forward.
Mavuika: The role of "Pyro Archon" simply makes it easier for me to fulfill that vision.
Traveler: I know what you mean.
Mavuika: Hehe, that comes as no surprise to me. You're someone with a clear set of morals — through all the trials and tribulations, your resolve never wavered.
Mavuika: That conviction is one of the key qualities of a leader.
Traveler: Hmm, can't say I really get it...
Mavuika: It's alright, that's just my own take on things.
Mavuika: Based on what I've seen, you have your own understanding of the world, and your place in it, so just believe in yourself — you're on the right path.
