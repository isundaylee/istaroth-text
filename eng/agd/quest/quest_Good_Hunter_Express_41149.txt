## Talk 1

Traveler: I'd love to, but I have to get going.
Sara: Eh? Oh, alright then. I'll ask somebody else. I don't get it... Why is everybody ordering take-out lately?

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'll deliver it right now.

## Talk 3

Short-Tempered Wallit: Why isn't it here yet? I have things to do, you know!

## Talk 4

Sara: That's right. Great timing, Traveler! Wallit ordered a stack of Tea Break Pancakes from us earlier. Don't worry, he's already paid beforehand.
Sara: He wants us to bring it to a place south of Brightcrown Canyon...
Sara: But we've been getting more and more take-out orders lately for some reason, and we can barely keep up.
Sara: If you don't mind, could you help us with this delivery?
