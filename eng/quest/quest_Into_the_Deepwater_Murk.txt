# Into the Deepwater Murk


## Talk 1

Paimon: Ugh... It's morning already... *yawn* Paimon still needs more sleep.
Traveler: Let's use some coupons to skip our shift this morning.
Paimon: Huh? Wait, look over there! Isn't that...
Paimon: It's one of Lyney's cards!
Traveler: You're right...
Paimon: Let Paimon see what's written on it...
Paimon: "Maybe you haven't heard, but today is the monthly 'free day.' Everyone has the day off today, which makes it the perfect time to do some investigating."
Paimon: "It's been a while since we last talked, have you been making any progress lately? Let's meet at our usual spot in the factory area before lunchtime. I have new information."
Paimon: Oh! Today's our lucky day, we have the day off!
Paimon: From the sound of it, Lyney's been making progress with his investigation. Wonder what he's discovered...
Paimon: Hmm, we still have some time before we meet up. Let's talk with the people here for a bit more before we go.
Traveler: It's been a while since we've contacted him.
Traveler: Let's take the morning off.

## Talk 2

Paimon: You really are something, to be able to fall asleep like that and even sleep-talk the entire time... You scared Paimon half to death!
Traveler: Did I say anything I shouldn't have?
Paimon: No, but you kept mumbling things along the lines of "Paimon, don't take my Grilled Fish" and "Put down the Adeptus' Temptation now."
Paimon: Paimon talked with Sigewinne the entire time you were asleep. She seems like she's just a sincere nurse, and Paimon didn't notice anything unusual in the room... Are you sure we're not going off-track with the infirmary?
Traveler: (...Are we really off-track, though? There are still a few weird things about the place.)
Traveler: (That movable hatch on the ground, as well as the question Sigewinne asked Lourvine... And also, were they really talking about their meds before we walked in?)
Traveler: (Oh, and was Lourvine and Jurieu's argument genuine, or were they just putting on a show?)
Traveler: Paimon, hear me out...
Paimon: Whoa, you really are super thorough! All those tiny little suspicious things that Paimon didn't even pick up on... We've gotta give the info to Lyney!
Black Screen Text: Over the next few days, you and Paimon work at your stations as normal. During your shifts, however, you manage to find opportunities to write keywords relating to your suspicions on a piece of paper.
Black Screen Text: You manage to pass the slip to a busy Lynette as she happens to pass by. Her disguise is impeccable, and she does not even look at you or change her expression as she pockets the info.
Black Screen Text: And finally, the promised ninth day arrives.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Look, there are some people talking over there. Let's listen in on the conversation.
Downcast Convict: If you ask me, those pompous parasites on the surface act like they're all a bunch of aristocrats. Do any of them give half a hoot about a bunch of dogs like us?
Grumpy Convict: Hey, speak for yourself, mate! I'm no dog!
Downcast Convict: Aww, you think you're special or something? If you're here, then you're just a convict like the rest of us! I've heard that even if you're released after serving your sentence, going back to life on the surface ain't any better. Once a criminal, always a criminal, we're marked for life.
Grumpy Convict: Hmph, I don't buy that.
Downcast Convict: Hey, how cool would it be if the whole world was destroyed by a giant flood and everyone had to start over from nothing?
Grumpy Convict: What kind of filthy bilgewater you spewing!? I have family up there! You best shut your sewer-hole with talk like that!
Grumpy Convict: Listen, things ain't so great on the surface, but who says that you have to leave? I've heard that you can still stay here and work even after you've served your sentence. Not bad if you ask me!
Grumpy Convict: Who wants to live in the ruddy overworld anyway!? Haha!
Downcast Convict: And what makes you think they'd want to hire someone like you? It's one of the great mysteries of the universe, how someone as useless as you is so confident...
Paimon: Whoa, sounds like they're really unhappy about the overworld.
Paimon: Speaking of which, Paimon never heard anyone use the words "overworld" or "underworld" when we were living up there. Is it only something the inmates down here say?
Traveler: I think you're right.
Paimon: That's true.
Traveler: It's normal for convicts to be unhappy.

## Talk 4

Paimon: There's a group of people over there, let's go listen in!
Cuistot: So I said, that's not a faucet... Hey, who're you two? Why'd you come over all of a sudden?
Paimon: Oh... Sorry for eavesdropping, sounds like you were talking about something private.
Laverune: What's the matter? Haha, they're just looking to join in on our fun, that's all.
Cuistot: Hey, don't pretend like it's okay for them to just interrupt us like that! Hmph... Fine, you're lucky we don't mind extroverts that much.
Traveler: Thanks, you guys are really nice!
Laverune: Haha, you hear that, Cuistot? We're nice!
Cuistot: Your expressions tell me you're looking to hear some juicy info, am I right? Hehe, but before that... It just so happens that I know you two.
Paimon: Really? Are we that famous?
Cuistot: You kidding? How often does anyone get a personal tour led by His Grace himself? Practically everyone was talking about it. Word has it that you also caused quite the kerfuffle.
Paimon: Oh, hehe... It was just a little mistake...
Laverune: A little mistake, huh? I like the way you put it. You see, people with a good attitude can join our group anytime, unlike some of the others here...
Paimon: Your group?
Cuistot: I'm Cuistot, and this is Laverune. People usually call us the "Bombshell Bros." But don't worry, we're not playing with bombs or anything, it's just that our information is always so explosive... and we blow minds on the regular.
Paimon: So... you two really like to gossip? You sure know how to embellish...
Cuistot: No, no! You don't get it. Knowing intelligence will make things better for you here. For example, knowing who's working with whom, who has the latest rumors, who's not getting along... Wouldn't you like to know all that?
Traveler: Sure, fill us in.
Cuistot: Ha, all this info is worth something, you know. You should prove you're worthy of it.
Laverune: Don't mind him, Cuistot is always this way. Just play nice and say something to massage his ego.
Laverune: (The welfare meals, talk about the welfare meals!)
Traveler: We ate the most incredible welfare meal recently!
Paimon: Right, right! That meal we had yesterday was super delicious. Paimon can still taste it whenever she closes her eyes!
Cuistot: ...Is that so? Heh. To tell you the truth, I've been helping out with making those welfare meals. I've been working as a kitchen assistant for about a month and a half now.
Paimon: Oh! So you're the one who made those delicious steaks... Amazing! You could be a professional chef!
Cuistot: You are correct. I am a true professional. In fact, I even went to culinary school. But enough about that.
Cuistot: Since you like my cooking, I guess that means we share similar tastes. Listen carefully. This little bombshell will help you learn what's really going on here in the Fortress.
Traveler: (Huh? Did Laverune just wink at me? It seems he's saying... "Don't be upset, he's a good fellow.")
Cuistot: Listen kids... The power structure within the Fortress is quite complicated. The overworlders couldn't care less about us down here, we're basically dogs to them.
Cuistot: You've already met the one person here you should never cross... The Duke, Wriothesley. He knows more than you think and if he doesn't care about something, then he often doesn't bother dealing with it.
Laverune: Those who have the Duke's attention get all kinds of special perks, even better treatment in the infirmary!
Cuistot: Ah, I know who you mean! It's that Jurieu character, right? I don't think there's anything useful about him at all. Why does he visit the infirmary practically every day? Is it normal for anyone to be going in and out of there so often? If you ask me, he's just faking it to get out of work.
Laverune: But did you know that Jurieu was a talented researcher from the Fontaine Research Institute before he came here? There's no denying that...
Cuistot: I don't care if he was a researcher that could turn dirt into Mora, once you're in the Fortress of Meropide, you're just another inmate like everybody else.
Traveler: (Ah, interesting. According to Cuistot, a person named Jurieu frequents the infirmary. I should take note of that.)
Cuistot: Speaking of which, the last time I saw him he was passing by in the corridor with Lourvine. I also heard they started arguing in the library and got into a fight, right? Guess that's just how terrible of a guy he is...
Laverune: You mean he hit a woman? Wow, I never imagined he was that bad...
Cuistot: But that Lourvine's also quite the odd one, you know. She's always gabbing away, got into a fight with a man, and she also got sent to the infirmary. Come to think of it, I always see her going to the sick bay every couple of days, too.
Cuistot: ...
Laverune: Wait a second, you don't think...
Cuistot: Do you think... Could it be that... They're secretly meeting there to go on dates? Huh, but it's really hard to imagine...
Laverune: After all, I do remember seeing Lourvine beat Jurieu to a pulp that one time and... We might be overthinking things.
Traveler: (So Jurieu had a confrontation with a girl named Lourvine, who also frequently visits the infirmary... I'll remember that, too.)
Traveler: Oh my archon I'd love to know, please tell me!

## Talk 5

Bavilliers: Hey, you over there!
Traveler: Who, me?
Bavilliers: Yeah, you! Say, do you like playing card games? You know, like Genius Invokation TCG!
Traveler: ...?
Paimon: You TCG players are like Mint in the wild. Literally sprouting up everywhere!
Bavilliers: Hey, c'mon now. What's wrong with finding fellow Invokation aficionados? Anyway, care to join me for a game?
Traveler: No thanks, we're busy with other things at the moment.
Bavilliers: Oh, alright. No pressure.
Paimon: But why would you be looking for people to play Genius Invokation in a place like this? Don't people usually come here to fight?
Bavilliers: Haha, whether you're throwing down cards or throwing punches, it's all a competition, isn't it? It's all the same in my eyes.
Bavilliers: There are lots of card players here in the Fortress. When I saw you, I immediately thought: Hey, even outsiders from other nations play cards! So I came over to say hi.
Traveler: Would you mind chatting with us for a moment?
Bavilliers: Sure.
Paimon: Great, since you've been here longer than us, you need to flex your seniority a little bit, right? Maybe you could start by telling us newcomers some stories about this place.
Bavilliers: I thought you would've already heard everything by now. Alright then, did you have anything specific in mind? Or do you want me to just pick a topic?
Paimon: Why don't you pick? We'll let you know if we've heard it already.
Bavilliers: Alright. Have you heard any strange rumors since you've arrived?
Traveler: Yes, we have.
Bavilliers: Then did you know that there are some people who're always gossiping over in the corner?
Traveler: Even people down here play that game?

## Talk 6

Lyney: ...
Lyney: ...!
Traveler: ...
Lyney: That look in your eyes... You've found something?
Traveler: A little something, yeah.
Paimon: Hey, this is no time to be modest! Just tell him we've found a boatload of information!
Lyney: Oho, as expected of the legendary duo. You have my full and undivided attention.
Black Screen Text: You summarize your findings to Lyney...
Lyney: ...Huh, I'd have never guessed that myself. The rumors swirling about this place are unreliable after all, and Master Childe probably went missing because he found a way out...
Lyney: He is a Harbinger, after all... I suppose he's much more resourceful than I initially gave him credit for.
Lyney: Unfortunately, this isn't enough for our final report to "Father." We need to find out Master Childe's exact whereabouts.
Lyney: Father told me that even though Master Childe said that he was just coming to Fontaine for a vacation, he actually had some personal reasons. His agenda might be linked to his disappearance.
Traveler: The most important thing right now is to catch up to him.
Paimon: His escape route is already flooded, so we'll have to task someone with professional diving skills to chase after him.
Lyney: Well, when you put it that way, it's obvious that only Freminet would be up to the task.
Paimon: Bingo! Is he around?
Lyney: He's working today — coming here as a group would have attracted too much attention. I'll talk to him about it later.
Traveler: Please do. We're counting on you.
Lyney: It's the least I can do. We're all in this together, so it's only fair for us to fulfill our end of the bargain.
Lyney: Honestly, I'm far more impressed by you guys managing to collect all this information right under Wriothesley's watchful eyes.
Paimon: Hehe, collecting information has always been our strong point!
Lyney: ...Now let me think. To find out more information, Freminet will have to re-trace Master Childe's original route...
Lyney: And if he's to do that, he'll have to set out on the next pipe-cleaning day at the earliest. That's six days from now... Hmm, and after that, he'll probably take another two or three days to return...
Paimon: You can even estimate how long it'll take for him to get back!?
Lyney: We've been working together for a long time... We know each other's capabilities like the backs of our hands.
Lyney: #{NICKNAME}, what say you to meeting here nine days from now? We'll be able to pick up Freminet while we're at it, too.
Traveler: Sure.
Lyney: Oh, and there's just one last thing we'd like your help with.
Lyney: Though we can just sit back and wait for Freminet's report on Master Childe's whereabouts, we still need to make more progress on the investigation of the forbidden zone...
Lyney: Freminet's no master of disguise, Lynette's still working on getting intel from the other areas, and I'll need to spend some time helping Freminet prepare for his diving mission. So... you are the only ones we can count on.
Paimon: What do you want us to do? Will it be hard?
Lyney: Well, I won't call it "easy," per se, but I think you'll be able to pull it off.
Lyney: Listen carefully. You'll need to find an excuse to get into the infirmary and investigate the room and environs.
Lyney: You've mentioned several sketchy-looking people always meeting at the infirmary earlier, so it probably has something to do with the secret we're hoping to uncover. You've already met the head nurse, so she'll be less suspicious of you.
Lyney: Investigate the internal structure of the infirmary and any active dealings within, and pass those onto me alongside anything else you're able to discover.
Lyney: But also, there's no need to take risks. Don't forget, safety always comes first!
Traveler: Sounds good. I'll give it my best shot.
Lyney: #Ah, my apologies, I just started rambling out of habit... It was almost as if I was talking to my younger {M#brother}{F#sister}.
Paimon: But that's not a bad thing, right?
Traveler: #But what if I'm the older {M#brother}{F#sister}?
Paimon: Alright, then we'll head out as soon as we finish our prep!
Lyney: Let's go our separate ways for now, then. Don't forget, we meet here again in nine days. Stay safe.
Traveler: Did you only say that because I'm an amateur?
Lyney: No, when it comes to intelligence gathering, I'd never consider you to be an amateur. Didn't you say it yourself? It's always been your strong suit.
Lyney: I'll believe anything as long as it comes from you. So, please prove your prowess to me once again.
Traveler: Thank you.
Lyney: No need to thank me! This was always a part of our mission, after all.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Hey, stay here for now! Paimon will take a peek.
Paimon: Hm... Hmm... There seem to be several people inside...
Traveler: Let's try to eavesdrop on them first.
Black Screen Text: You and Paimon hide in a corner and try your best to eavesdrop on the people inside the infirmary.
Black Screen Text: Several people appear to be engaged in conversation, but you only manage to catch bits and pieces of what they're saying...
Lourvine: ...Right... I feel like...
Jurieu: It's not impossible...
Sigewinne: ...So... Time...
Paimon: It's a bit hard to understand them from here, so why don't we just try to talk to them in person? Let's go as soon as you're ready!
Black Screen Text: You nod and take a long, deep breath before inhaling a large amount of vapor from a foul-smelling potion you found from the bottom of your inventory.
Black Screen Text: If you recall correctly, that potion is the result of a failed attempt at alchemy you once performed with Paimon at some point during your journey. In any case, its smell makes you want to hurl...
Traveler: *retching*
Black Screen Text: Having given it a good whiff, you hand the potion back to Paimon to stow it away. Soon after, you stagger into the infirmary, your face pale and your hand pressed against the wall.

## Talk 8

Paimon: #Someone, please help! {M#He}{F#She}... {M#He}{F#She}'s sick!
Jurieu: Whoa, are you okay?
Sigewinne: Oh my! What's wrong, little one? There's no need to panic — take a deep breath before you begin.
Paimon: #{NICKNAME} started complaining of a stomach ache, and then nausea, and then collapsed onto the ground... Paimon d—doesn't know what to do...
Paimon: Freezing limbs, twitching fingers, and pale complexion... Could it be poison...?
Sigewinne: Let me take a look... Please lie down over here.
Traveler: Oof... My stomach really hurts...
Sigewinne: Don't worry, I'll get you to the bed safely. Here, hold onto my shoulder and walk slowly...
Paimon: #*sniff*... You can do it, {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: Th—Thank you... I'm sorry.
Sigewinne: Don't apologize! You're sick, after all. Now, please relax, I'm just going to do a preliminary check-up on you.
Traveler: (Sigewinne has taken out a few instruments and begun to do her check-up... I hope I'm not so healthy that she gets suspicious...)
Sigewinne: ...Hmm, mmm. I see now.
Sigewinne: #My check-up has confirmed that {F#she}{M#he}'s not in any mortal danger. That's our worst fear out of the way!
Paimon: Eh? Ah, th—that's good, but...
Sigewinne: I'll continue my diagnosis of the patient now. Please relax and take a deep breath.
Traveler: (Sigewinne's using her hands to palpate different areas on my abdomen... Seems like she's using elemental energy, too? Her expression's growing more and more relaxed...)
Sigewinne: I don't sense serious damage to your organs, either. Does it hurt when I press here?
Traveler: I—It's not too bad.
Sigewinne: And here?
Traveler: Oof, that hurt a little...
Sigewinne: Eh? But based on my initial check-up, there shouldn't be a problem here... How strange...
Traveler: (Oh no, was my acting a bit over the top?)
Sigewinne: Hmm... What about here? Does this hurt?
Traveler: No, not really, can barely feel it.
Sigewinne: Oh... Mmm, I understand. So that's what it is.
Sigewinne: I think you just ate something that disagreed with you, that's all. Nothing too serious, outside of a pretty bad stomachache when it decides to act up.
Paimon: Ah... So that's what it is... Thank goodness it's not anything more serious!
Sigewinne: Mhm, and there've been other inmates complaining about the food recently. I'll inform our head chef Mr. Wolsey of this problem as soon as possible.
Sigewinne: Congratulations, the health risk is incredibly low, so you should recover within a couple days. Why don't you take a rest here while I go get some medicine for you?
Sigewinne: Miss Lourvine... I'll have to trouble you to help me look after this new patient while I'm gone.
Lourvine: Very well.
Paimon: Ah, and she hopped away just like that...
Traveler: (Phew, this infiltration mission is going much more smoothly than I imagined. Next... There are only two people left in the room.)
Traveler: (Sigewinne just called that woman "Lourvine," so she has to be one of those frequent visitors to the infirmary I've heard of before. Would that mean the man next to her is "Jurieu," then?)
Lourvine: Hello... So how are you feeling now?
Traveler: Still not great...
Traveler: (I can't keep staring at her, it'll draw unwanted attention... That guy also seems to have noticed, now he's looking in my direction, too.)
Paimon: #{F#Her}{M#His} stomachache's really bad, {F#she}{M#he} was stumbling about the whole way here, so Paimon's really worried...
Lourvine: If Miss Sigewinne says it's not a serious problem, then there's no need to worry. She's the best medic we've got down here.
Paimon: But it also looks like she's the only medic you've got down here...
Jurieu: Ah, well... That's true.
Lourvine: What do you mean, "that's true"? That's really misrepresenting the situation. Of course I can't speak for the whole Fortress, but it's not like everyone imprisoned here is useless, you know.
Lourvine: Though they may have committed crimes and gotten locked up here as a result, they still know a thing or two about medicine, and they help Miss Sigewinne take care of the sick and injured.
Jurieu: Yeah yeah, you're right, but did you have to lecture me about it in front of another patient? Aren't you a patient too? Where did all your energy come from?
Lourvine: Uh... Ah, that's correct. Ahem... Sorry, I got a bit ahead of myself.
Paimon: Are you two also sick?
Jurieu: We've been sick a while. I come back every once in a while for check-ups, and to pick up the medicines Miss Sigewinne prescribes for us, that's just the nature of chronic illnesses. As for her...
Jurieu: Hah, you could say she fancies herself as Miss Sigewinne's capable helper because she learned a bit of medical knowledge ages ago.
Lourvine: Please watch your mouth, Mr. Jurieu. Don't forget that you are the primary reason I have frequent heart palpitations!
Paimon: Hey, don't start arguing now! Please, keep it civil at least...
Traveler: (These two seem to have a pretty terrible relationship, and only ran into each other because they came here to pick up their meds at the same time.)
Traveler: (...But outside of the two of them, there's nothing suspicious inside the room. All the files on the table appear to be patient records, and while there's a box... I can't check it out right now.)
Traveler: (There also aren't that many furnishings on the wall... Eh? Wait, there seems to be a movable hatch on the ground over there?)
Paimon: Hey! Hey, there's no need to fight! Everyone will be released someday, so there's no need to argue over silly things like this!
Lourvine: But...
Jurieu: Hmph, release? It's way too early for us to even think about that! And who the heck knows if we'd even be able to continue our previous lives?
Traveler: (The presence of a movable hatch isn't strange by itself, but... perhaps it's my adventurer's intuition speaking, but isn't it a bit strange that there's a movable hatch here of all places?)
Traveler: (Is it... hiding something?)
Lourvine: Please allow me to end this boring and useless conversation. Oh, and Mr. Jurieu, I don't want to see your face here again anytime soon!
Jurieu: And same to you, Miss Lourvine. Anyway, that was more than enough rest for me, so I'm going to get out of this excessively noisy place. See you later, everyone.
Paimon: He just slowly walked off like that...?
Lourvine: Hmph, that's just what he's like.
Lourvine: I'm sorry you had to see all of that. I'm Lourvine, and that's... Well, his name is Jurieu, but I hope you'll never have cause to remember his name.
Paimon: You really can't stand him, eh?
Lourvine: I mean, can you blame me? Who would like someone who's as arrogant and obsessed with weird research topics as he is? ...Ahem, but there's no need to keep dwelling on him.
Lourvine: I—I'll accompany you two for a while... Miss Sigewinne should be back soon, and I'm sure you'll feel better as soon as you've had some of her medicine.
Traveler: Thank you for looking after me.
Lourvine: No, no... It's nothing.
Sigewinne: I'm back~! Did you rest like you promised?
Lourvine: Thank you for getting our medicine, Miss Sigewinne.
Sigewinne: Did you all cooperate with your bedrest? I trust that nobody got up to walk around? Good, here, this should be two days' worth of medicine for you. Take one pill now, and then continue your bedrest.
Black Screen Text: You take the stomachache pill that Sigewinne gave you.
Sigewinne: Ahh, Miss Lourvine, I left in a bit of a hurry just now, do you still remember if we discussed the color of the pill that you should be taking today?
Lourvine: I remember. You said it should be yellow.
Traveler: (...Did they talk about that before we walked in? Why don't I remember?)
Sigewinne: Yellow, huh... Hmm, I understand. These are yours — please make sure to go to bed early after taking them tonight. You'll benefit from a good night's sleep.
Lourvine: Alright, then I'll also be on my way now. I hope you feel better soon, too.
Traveler: Thanks.
Paimon: See ya!
Sigewinne: I'm going to fill out your medical record now. You're widely known as the Traveler, right? I just want to double check a few details, if that's alright with you.
Paimon: #Those two made quite the commotion just now, so why don't we let {NICKNAME} rest? Paimon can answer the questions instead.
Sigewinne: #Mmm-hmm, so {F#her}{M#his} primary symptoms are abdominal pain, with secondary symptoms of nausea. Is there anything else?
Paimon: Hmm... That's it!
Sigewinne: Alright then~!
Paimon: Is there anything we should know, besides to take the meds?
Sigewinne: #No, {F#her}{M#his} base constitution is quite good, so I'm sure {F#she}{M#he}'ll recover quite quickly after taking the medicine. Please make sure to stick to blander, less stimulating foods, and don't stay up too late at night.
Paimon: #Got it, Paimon will hold {NICKNAME} to that for sure!
Traveler: (Sigewinne's still looking at me... I should just try to take a nap, like she said.)
Paimon: Oh? You're going to take a nap already? ...Okay, then, you get some rest!
Black Screen Text: (You move yourself to a regular patient's bed and relax completely. The weariness from work and intel-gathering that you've been holding back all this time overwhelm you at once.)
Black Screen Text: ...You can, however, still catch some hints of Paimon's conversation with Sigewinne.
Paimon: #Mhm, we've been to lots of places together! {F#She}{M#He} may look a bit under the weather now, but {F#she}{M#he}'s actually suuuuuper strong!
Sigewinne: #Oh, so you're the best of companions. Don't worry, {F#she}{M#he} will recover soon.
Black Screen Text: ...Companion. That word brings forth a wave of comfort. You let yourself relax and fall into a restful sleep.
Sigewinne: ...Ah, you're awake.
Paimon: How do you feel? You slept for a really long time, but we never left!
Traveler: I feel a lot better. Thank you both.
Sigewinne: Well, now you can go back without a worry in the world! Remember to take your meds regularly, and don't forget, bland foods!
Paimon: Mhm! Thank you, Miss Sigewinne!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: You mean Cuistot and Laverune?
Bavilliers: Yes, so you've already met those two. Hahaha, they're quite a pair. They always keep an eye out for the latest happenings and gossip about everything. I've never seen anyone with more time on their hands...
Bavilliers: I heard that they used to be a chef and a bartender before they were sent down here. You know how bartenders are... always chatting with customers. And chefs love to pass the time just hanging out when they're not cooking.

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: I didn't know that.
Bavilliers: There are two guys who are always skulking around in the corners of corridors gossiping. The bigger guy is Cuistot, and the skinny one is Laverune. People call them the "Bombshell Bros."
Bavilliers: I never really found their gossip very "mind-blowing"... It's pretty much just the same stuff that I hear about when I'm at work every day.
Bavilliers: If you're interested, you can go talk with them. They tend to talk a lot of nonsense, but they aren't exactly bad.

### Additional Talk 3

Grumpy Convict: Anyway, I've already decided to stay here.
Downcast Convict: *sigh* Wish I could say the same...

### Additional Talk 4

Cuistot: Is it really alright for us to talk about people behind their backs like this...?
Laverune: That's just how it goes, good gossip is still gossip.
Cuistot: Yeah, I guess you're right... But wait, we're not just gossiping, this is legit information we're discussing here, right?

### Additional Talk 5

Bavilliers: See ya later. Hey, let's play a game if you ever have time.

### Additional Talk 6

Sigewinne: Seems like a lot of people have been coming down with an upset stomach lately... I'll need to address that.

### Additional Talk 7

Grumpy Convict: Anyway, I've already decided to stay here.
Downcast Convict: *sigh* Wish I could say the same...

### Additional Talk 8

Cuistot: Is it really alright for us to talk about people behind their backs like this...?
Laverune: That's just how it goes, good gossip is still gossip.
Cuistot: Yeah, I guess you're right... But wait, we're not just gossiping, this is legit information we're discussing here, right?

### Additional Talk 9

Bavilliers: See ya later. Hey, let's play a game if you ever have time.

### Additional Talk 10

Paimon: Hmm, good to know. Do you have anything else to tell us?
Bavilliers: Hmm, let me think. Sounds like you want to hear something a little more tantalizing.
Bavilliers: Oh, did you know that the Duke was also a convict in the Fortress of Meropide before?
Paimon: Huh? Wait, are you serious!?
Bavilliers: That's right, the Duke was an inmate just like you and me. It seems he was exiled here for committing some crime. Who knows how he ended up rising up to become the warden though...
Bavilliers: To go from an ordinary inmate to becoming the manager of the whole place... I'm not gonna lie, I kinda respect that.
Traveler: By the way, do you happen to know anything about a "forbidden zone"?
Bavilliers: A "forbidden zone"? Hmm, sounds like something that someone just made up. I've never heard of that, where did you hear about it?
Paimon: It's just a rumor we've been hearing, but no worries if you've never heard of it. Do you have anything else you can tell us?
Bavilliers: Anything else? Hmm... Not that I can think of, but I'll be sure to tell you anything interesting I hear next time! You'll have to play a game of Genius Invokation with me first, though!
