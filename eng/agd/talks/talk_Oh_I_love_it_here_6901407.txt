Barbara: Oh, I love it here!
Barbara: The scenery here is so different from Mondstadt's. I find it really refreshing.
Barbara: And, here I can sing at the top of my voice without having to worry if I'm disturbing anyone! It's the best way to practice.
Traveler: Surely no one would ever consider your sweet voice a disturbance?
Barbara: Ah...
Barbara: It sure is nice of you to say that! But, uh... still, I always need to make sure I'm being considerate of other people.
Barbara: Anyway, I'm really happy you invited me here!
Barbara: I think I'd like to stay here a little longer.
Traveler: That's great!
Barbara: Yeah... I'm just so happy that you invited me to come here.
