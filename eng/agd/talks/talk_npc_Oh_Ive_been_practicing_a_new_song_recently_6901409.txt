# Talk Dialog

Barbara: Oh, I've been practicing a new song recently.
Barbara: But I'm still trying to iron out a few details...
Barbara: When I repeat the chorus, should I go up a half step? I can't decide... And I think there's room for improvement with the dance routine, but I'm not sure...
Barbara: If it's no trouble, I'd really appreciate it if you could watch my performance and give me your suggestions.
Traveler: You have my unconditional support.
Barbara: Thank you...!
Barbara: Um... Please don't laugh at me if there are parts that still need practicing.
Barbara: I've thought about this a lot of times in the past, but it's taken me this long to finally pluck up the courage to perform for you at such close distance.
Barbara: If you laughed at me, there'd be nowhere I could run from my embarrassment...
Traveler: Don't worry. I won't laugh.
Barbara: Whew... Okay.
Barbara: Then...
Barbara: Let the show begin!
Traveler: I believe in you, and you should believe in yourself as well.
Traveler: It would be my honor.
