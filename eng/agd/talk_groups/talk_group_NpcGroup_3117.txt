## Talk

Ooizumi: Are you... with the Shogunate?
Ooizumi: Hmm, you don't seem like one of them.
Ooizumi: If you are a Shogunate lackey, I shall not show mercy.

## Talk

Traveler: You seem to really hate the Shogunate.
Ooizumi: Of course. If I didn't, why would I be with the resistance?
Ooizumi: I can't put up with the Shogunate's actions. They only care about raising taxes and suppressing the commoners instead of doing productive things. The Vision Hunt Decree was just the final straw, that's all. There are a ton of other reasons why everyone hates them.
Ooizumi: Ever since the war started, we've constantly had to regroup after just a few battles. I have no clue when we'll finally win.
Ooizumi: Because I can't defy my orders, I can't really do anything, even though I just want to annihilate the entire Shogunate, even if I had to do it by myself. For now, I'm a scout on front line, observing the movements of the Shogun's Army.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Ooizumi: Yeah, you watch out for those Shogunate dogs too.

## Talk

Ooizumi: *sigh* I'm sure you've heard of the peace negotiations between the Shogunate and Sangonomiya, right?
Ooizumi: To be honest, this result is kinda... disappointing...

## Talk

Traveler: Why's that?
Ooizumi: The oppressive practices of the Shogunate played out before our eyes day after day. Are we really just going to just call things square after all that?
Ooizumi: The Sakoku Decree, the Vision Hunt Decree... These both led to incredible amounts of suffering. We can't forget their actions just because we're all praying for a short-term peace.
Ooizumi: And as far as I know the Shogunate, they're not going to stop here. That's why we must remain vigilant as well. Someday, we'll make them pay for what they've done.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Ooizumi: Yeah. You watch out for the Shogunate too.
