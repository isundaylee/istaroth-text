Shrine: (It looks like an ordinary shrine — there is a distinct lack of any strange elemental traces.)
Traveler: Investigate
Shrine: (This shrine seems to be in good condition, and appears to have been maintained quite carefully in recent days. The person who did this must be conscientious indeed.)
Shrine: (Otherwise, there are no traces of someone having been here.)
Paimon: How strange... seems like someone's been here before.

## Talk 2

Paimon: There's another shrine over there. Let's take a look, shall we?
Shrine: (It looks like an ordinary shrine — there is a distinct lack of any strange elemental traces.)
Traveler: Investigate
Shrine: (This shrine is clean and tidy, and gives off the faint fragrance of the Sacred Sakura. Someone has prayed here recently.)
Shrine: (Otherwise, there are no newer traces.)
Paimon: This scent is... the Sacred Sakura's! Chouji's mom might have come by this place!
Paimon: Pretty recently, too!

## Talk 3

Paimon: This shrine looks super new! Let's take a closer look at it!
Shrine: (It looks like an ordinary shrine — there is a distinct lack of any strange elemental traces.)

Paimon: Looks like someone often comes to take care of this shrine.

## Talk 4

Paimon: This is probably the shrine that Chouji mentioned, huh?
Shrine: (It looks like an ordinary shrine — there is a distinct lack of any strange elemental traces.)
Traveler: Investigate
Shrine: (The shrine is simple but elegant. Its wood shimmers slightly, greeting guests and their offerings with solemn silence.)
Shrine: (Many Sacred Sakura petals lie scattered around this shrine, though it is not a natural scene. Instead, it seems more like someone intentionally scattered the Sakura Blooms here.)
Paimon: Huh... There aren't any traces here, either.
Traveler: Look, Sakura Blooms...
Paimon: Oh right. Chouji mentioned that his mom would present this offering to the shrine!
Paimon: There are so many petals here, too... This can't be a coincidence.
Paimon: Let's go back and tell him!
Traveler: It's Chouji's mother's offering...

## Talk 5

Paimon: There are shrines here too, looks familiar!
Shrine: (It looks like an ordinary shrine — there is a distinct lack of any strange elemental traces.)
Traveler: Investigate
Shrine: (This shrine looks pretty dilapidated. The wooden facade has become pitted and faded, revealing traces of dangerous dark red lines underneath.)
Paimon: This shrine is super creepy... Paimon's getting goosebumps...
Paimon: Let's get out of here!
