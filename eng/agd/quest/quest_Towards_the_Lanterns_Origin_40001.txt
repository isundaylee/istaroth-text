# Towards the Lanterns Origin


## Talk 1

Paimon: Finally, we're in *Liyue*!
Bolai: #Young man, if I may be so bold. How much for the floating thing?
Traveler: It's not for sale!
Paimon: Paimon's not for sale!
Bolai: Hahaha... As a matter of fact, I'm having some financial trouble recently. I probably couldn't afford it.
Bolai: I'm just a small-time merchant anyway, I don't deal in rare and exotic treasures.
Paimon: Y'know, the more you talk, the more suspicious you sound...
Bolai: My, someone's in a grumpy mood aren't they? Here, maybe some candy will make you feel better?
Paimon: ...Ooh, suspiciously trustworthy!
Bolai: So, I assume you two are in Liyue for the Lantern Rite?
Bolai: This year's Mingxiao Lantern is supposed to be a sight well worth the wait. The Plaustrite that will lift the lantern into the air is the largest in twenty years!
Bolai: It's big enough to make you wonder... if the fabled floating city in the clouds really does exist...
Bolai: I guess it must just be held up by a similarly sized chunk of Plaustrite.
Paimon: Sounds awesome!
Bolai: Haha! I hope our paths cross again. Welcome to Liyue! ...Well, I can't speak for the whole of *Liyue Harbor*, but you're always welcome in my store at least!
Traveler: Trust me, you couldn't afford it.
Paimon: What a strange thing to say!
Paimon: But Paimon's curious... What number did you have in mind, exactly?
Paimon: Ugh, forget it. Let's assume you meant Paimon is worth more than Mora can buy.

## Talk 2

Paimon: #Look, Traveler! That chained-up stone is floating in the air.
Paimon: If it wasn't held down, who knows where it would fly off to?
Jiangzhou: This is the Plaustrite to be used for the Mingxiao Lantern. The whole of the Xiao Market is centered around it.
Paimon: Oh, hello. Who are you?
Jiangzhou: I'm Jiangzhou. Recently, I've been tracking progress on the construction of the Mingxiao Lantern.
Jiangzhou: You seem like newcomers — is this your first Lantern Rite?
Paimon: Yes... How can you tell?
Jiangzhou: Well, I don't remember running into any weird and wonderful mascots at last year's festival.
Jiangzhou: I'm very happy to answer any questions you have about the festival.
Traveler: What's the Mingxiao Lantern?
Jiangzhou: You'll see lots of people releasing little lanterns during the festival — those ones are called Xiao Lanterns. But there's also a huge one, a joint effort by all the people of Liyue Harbor. That one is called the Mingxiao Lantern.
Jiangzhou: Almost every business in Liyue has a booth at the annual Xiao Market — but despite its popularity, this is the one time of the year they're not looking to make a profit. The street market exists solely to raise the funds and materials required for the Mingxiao Lantern construction.
Jiangzhou: If you want, you can come and help.
Paimon: What's in it for us?
Jiangzhou: The Mingxiao Lantern will honor your hard work. On the first full moon of the new year, when we bid farewell to the old and welcome the new, your wishes will be—
Paimon: That's all well and good, but Paimon was hoping for something a little more... substantial.
Jiangzhou: *sigh* Must you be so matter-of-fact? Yes, we need to keep our feet firmly planted on solid ground, but should we not also gaze up in wonder at the stars? In this life, you have to keep in touch with your inner child...
Jiangzhou: But to get to the point, anyone who helps out with the Mingxiao Lantern gets something from the *Xiao Market*.
Paimon: To get even more to the point... there are tasty snacks to play for here?
Paimon: #Traveler, let's hop to it! We should ask around at the *Xiao Market*.

## Talk 3

Manager Xiao: How would you like to make your own Xiao Lantern?
Manager Xiao: Great! Always nice to see youngsters with a can-do attitude.
Manager Xiao: Here, take these materials. I trust you know how to use a *Crafting Bench*?

## Talk 4

Madame Ping: This year's Mingxiao Lantern is dedicated to Skybracer... He always was a show off — I'm sure he will be very pleased!
Traveler: Who's Skybracer?
Madame Ping: This year's Mingxiao Lantern will be the spitting image of him when it's complete!
Madame Ping: Well, that's the plan. I do hope they make the antlers big enough, they were his pride and joy after all.
Madame Ping: The story goes that the antlers were made from the very essence of Rex Lapis' divine power, which made it the hardest material in all of Liyue.
Madame Ping: But then, that fateful battle happened... The gods exchanged powerful blows, and the mountains started collapsing. To avoid impacting the villagers at the foot of the mountain, the adeptus got his friend to chop his antlers off...
Madame Ping: He used those blood-drenched antlers as a wedge to prop up the mountain. And if that wasn't enough of a sacrifice, he then kept on fighting until his blood was drained and his life ran out...
Madame Ping: Thanks to him, Mt. Tianheng still stands tall and proud to this day. And the blood that he lost in the battle turned into the Bishui River.
Madame Ping: Hehehe... Whether you believe the story or not, I'm just happy you're willing to listen to me tell it.
Madame Ping: Surely, the reason the Lantern Rite exists is because people throughout the ages have chosen to come together as friends rather than stay in isolation.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Madame Ping: Goodbye. May the flames of wisdom spread to all, and never be extinguished.

## Talk 5

Changchang: I'm Changchang, I just donated Dolly. She's my ragdoll.
Changchang: Last night in my dream, Dolly told me her wish was to fly up into the sky and see the view.
Changchang: So I gave her to the lady over by the big deer lantern. Dolly's wish will come true now, won't it?
Changchang: I did the right thing, didn't I? Wishes are supposed to come true at the Lantern Rite, aren't they?
