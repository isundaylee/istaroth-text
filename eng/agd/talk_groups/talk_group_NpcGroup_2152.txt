Old Chou: Hey there! Wanna come "dig for treasure"?

## Talk

Traveler: How did you end up setting up a stall here?
Old Chou: *sigh* Well, it's a long story. I was once a Treasure Hoarder, doing some business near The Chasm. Uh, please, put your sword away. I've turned over a new life and gone legit.
Old Chou: Of course, I did have some Mora stashed away when I split from the crew, but it all went down the drain after a while due to... some circumstances. As such, I was forced to set up shop here and earn a little cash that way.

Traveler: See you.
Old Chou: Alright then. See ya!

## Talk

Old Chou: Ya-hey, you'll miss out if you just walk about! Come on, try digging for some treasure instead!
Old Chou: How about it? Are you interested?
Paimon: What is this, anyway? Do you mean that we can dig up treasure somewhere amongst these piles of dirt?
Old Chou: Of course... you might, ahaha!
Old Chou: These piles of earth are filled with anything from cabbages to ore. There's some truly good stuff in there, too!
Paimon: Good stuff, huh?
Paimon: Can't we just keep digging till we get the good stuff, then?
Old Chou: No, of course not. Now, I'm not going to lie to you, or my name's not Old Chou! See, some piles of dirt also have explosives hidden within them. You can keep digging so long as you don't dig any of those up.
Old Chou: But once you do, it's game over — game over!
Paimon: Explosives? That sounds like a dangerous game we're playing here.
Old Chou: Oh, no worries, these were all pilfer— I mean, borrowed on the sly many years ago from the underground mining camps. They're definitely duds, right down to the last one!
Old Chou: So, how about it? Want to have a go?

## Talk

Traveler: Start digging.

## Talk

Traveler: Where's the treasure, huh? You sure you're not cheating us?
Old Chou: No, no, I would never do that! Now, your man Old Chou here's not a man of fancy birth, no sir, but I can at least claim to be an honorable person!
Old Chou: You know what? C'mere, let me give you a hint for all your trouble.
Old Chou: So, get this... the best stuff is always surrounded by the most explosives. For example, the four tiles around a treasure chest will all contain explosives!
Old Chou: Only two of the tiles around ore will contain those explosives, and the tiles that surround a tile with no treasure at all will most certainly be free of any danger.
Old Chou: So what I'm saying is, don't be too discouraged if you dig up a couple of explosives. There's light at the end of the tunnel — you'll see!

## Talk

Old Chou: Huh? Wow, you sure went through the whole lot really quickly. Um, g—give me a moment to reset the tiles, would you?
Old Chou: Just, ah, go busy yourself elsewhere for the time being while I get set up again... And no peeking during that time, you hear?

## Talk

Old Chou: You'd like to go for another round? Well, you're a real good sport, make no mistake, but I can't set this game up with all my grand prizes in your pockets. You've got to wait for a while, if you don't mind.
