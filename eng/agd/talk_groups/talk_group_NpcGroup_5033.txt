## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about Fontaine's mineral products.

## Talk

Estelle: The ore supplier was just here, and I heard from them that the nearby mines barely have anything left. I'm sorry. I'll let you know if I hear anything else.

## Talk

Estelle: Hello there, what can I help you with?

## Talk

Traveler: I'd like something made.
Estelle: Please give me the details, and I'll start operating the machine right away.

## Talk

Traveler: I'd like to buy a weapon.
Estelle: Take your pick — each one of our products is masterfully crafted.

## Talk

Traveler: Is this machine used to forge weapons?
Estelle: That's right. I'm very proud of this one, in fact.
Estelle: After all, are machines not eminently suited to this energy-intensive work we call forging, being able to control strength and temperature precisely as they are?
Estelle: Even someone with the most ordinary of physical qualities like me can make exquisite, honed weaponry, just like those muscled smiths.

## Talk

Traveler: I don't need anything at the moment.
Estelle: In that case, take care.

Estelle: Your previous order is complete. Do you have any other requests?

## Talk

Traveler: Could you tell me about the "prophecy"?
Estelle: Ah, the flood. That magic pocket your magician friend provided proved very useful.
Estelle: I wasn't a believer in the prophecy myself. But I put a lot of spare parts and tools inside, just in case.
Estelle: And boy, am I glad I did. I'd never have found them all if the water had swept them away.
Estelle: So it looks like you and your friends weren't affected too badly? Great, it's such a relief the prophecy crisis has finally passed.

## Talk

Traveler: Could you tell me about the "prophecy"?
Estelle: Ah, you've finished delivering Magic Pockets with that magician, I see. Good work.
Estelle: To be honest, I think he's influenced me a bit — I couldn't help but send some of my friends a couple of those pockets.
Estelle: I was originally a renowned scientist working at the Fontaine Research Institute. By right, I shouldn't believe in such things.
Estelle: But as they say, it never hurts to be prepared. A rigorous researcher should take all manner of possibilities into consideration.
