Mats: This won't do. There won't be any end to this...
Paimon: What's wrong, Mats? What's up with the store?
Mats: It's an old problem. I have some daily necessities that have been shipped to my store, and they've been caught in the middle of the wind, waves, and tide.
Mats: I was hoping to dry them while we were open, in hopes that they would be ready to sell for cheap at the end of the festival.
Mats: But the sunshine in Mondstadt is too gentle, and we are here beside Cider Lake, where the air is humid. So far, nothing has gone as planned.
Mats: If it goes on like this, our daily necessities will get moldy.
Paimon: Hmm... this is a bit tricky.
Paimon: Maybe we can make a fire to dry the shipment... but that would be too dangerous... Bernhard and Leah would stop it.
