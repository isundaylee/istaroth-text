Traveler: So, about your daughter...
Yoh: My daughter Atsuko has been a free-spirited girl since she was young. Ever since the Sakoku Decree took effect, she became more and more unhappy.
Yoh: Soon, she left us and started traveling abroad.
Yoh: However, Atsuko came home just a while back.
Yoh: Her mother and I were so happy during those few days. The girl we were looking forward to seeing finally came back. It was like a dream.
Yoh: Sadly, she didn't stay long before leaving. She probably left to travel some more.
Yoh: Our girl is all grown up now. She has her own view of the world. Guess we can't keep her here forever...
