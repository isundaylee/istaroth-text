## Talk 1

Siegfria: How am I already hungry again...
Siegfria: Oh, it's you! Wonderful. Do you still remember me?
Siegfria: From the cook-off, with Xiangling? That was me, Siegfria!
Siegfria: Hehe, do you remember now? Anyway, you've come at a great time. Could I... ask you to help me with something?
Traveler: What do you need?
Siegfria: Do you still recall the Jade Parcels that you made the previous time?
Siegfria: They were so delicious, I can still taste them, even now.
Siegfria: So I wanted to give it a try and make some myself, but... it always feels like there's something missing...
Siegfria: I feel like if I get to try it a few more times, I can recreate that flavor too!
Siegfria: So, could I ask you to make some Jade Parcels for me to try?

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'll see it done.
Siegfria: Great! Thank you so much. I'll be waiting over here.
Siegfria: Hehe... I'll finally be able to eat Jade Parcels again...

## Talk 3

Traveler: Would you like anything else?
Siegfria: Ugh, well... I'd also like to eat other things. But if I tried to eat everything, then I wouldn't be able to eat anything at all.
Siegfria: So I'd like to get a firm grasp on how Jade Parcels taste first.

## Talk 4

Siegfria: This is great! I'll finally get to taste the Jade Parcels you make again.
Siegfria: I do know the recipe, and I have been able to figure out how to make it, but it doesn't quite match the flavor it had when you made it.
Siegfria: *sigh* If only you could make those Jade Parcels for me a few more times. There are still many intricacies to them that I have yet to work out.

## Talk 5

Siegfria: Are the Jade Parcels ready yet?

## Talk 6

Siegfria: ...Ah, they're all gone.
Siegfria: The mouthfeel of those vegetables... the perfectly paired flavors of the ham and the lotus... and that soup...
Siegfria: This is it â€” this is the flavor that I tasted the last time!
Siegfria: Thanks for coming over just to make me this dish. I need to go back and make some notes.
Siegfria: Next we meet, I will definitely be able to make a batch of perfect Jade Parcels.
Siegfria: When that time comes, do swing by to have a taste.

## Talk 7

Siegfria: The freshness of the ham, the mouthfeel of the vegetables, and this faint spiciness...
Siegfria: Hmm, this is not bad. It's a really good serving of Jade Parcels!
Siegfria: Thanks for coming over just to make me this dish. I need to go back and make some notes.
Siegfria: Next we meet, I will definitely be able to make a batch of perfect Jade Parcels.
Siegfria: When that time comes, do swing by to have a taste.
