Dehya: Did you really shove an entire kebab shop in here? It's got everything: tools, equipment, even a table and chairs.
Dehya: Since you've got everything ready... I say, let grill master Dehya take it from here.
Dehya: What? I can't hunt any of the animals here? Okay, fine. Then I'm gonna head out and find some fresh meat.
