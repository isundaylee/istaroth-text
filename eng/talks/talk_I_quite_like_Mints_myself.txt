Traveler: I quite like Mints myself.
Shana: Oho... Such a cool texture, and what a refreshing aftertaste. Just like placing your hand on a machine that's just been wiped clean...
Shana: Ahh, the smell of steel, as fresh as a handful of Mint!
Shana: ...Of course, you can eat Mint, but I'd advise against actually trying to taste an ice-cold Iron Chunk.
