Traveler: Settings?
Banu: Yes, settings. You looked as confused as when we were talking about the setting of the Future Stars just now. Are you unfamiliar with settings?
Banu: I can teach you how to come up with them. So next time, when you get bored, you can create your own settings just for fun.
Banu: Shalmar said settings are just sets of rules. Many rules are created by others, but you can also create your own rules. And that's fun!
Banu: For example, Shalmar would take back old items that the Akademiya had intended to get rid of. We would come up with a setting for each item and all of a sudden, they became new and useful.
Banu: Shalmar and I came up with the setting of the Future Stars together. They used to be called Parvo Cores. I mean, "Future Star" is just a much better name than that, right?
Banu: But soon, I'll be studying at the Akademiya and have little time to hang out with Shalmar anymore.
