Traveler: About the Yashiro Commission...
Madarame Hyakubei: The Yashiro Commission, the Kanjou Commission, and the Tenryou Commission are known as the "Tri-Commission."
Madarame Hyakubei: The Yashiro Commission is different from the other two commissions. It's responsible for cultural affairs in Inazuma, like offerings to shrines, ceremonial affairs, publishing books, and so on.
Madarame Hyakubei: Because of that, we often hear the various wishes of the people of Inazuma...
Madarame Hyakubei: Miss Kamisato is a very kind lady. She has persuaded the Commissioner to allocate funds and resources to help grant the peoples' wishes.
Madarame Hyakubei: But since the requests concern many different aspects of life here, we usually have a shortage of manpower when things get busy...
Madarame Hyakubei: Now that I mention it, would you be interested in helping us out? You will be paid fairly, of course. Once you have more experience and a better reputation, you will receive more important and better-paying commissions.
