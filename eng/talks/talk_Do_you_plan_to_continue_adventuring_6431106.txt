Traveler: Do you plan to continue adventuring?
Philby: Uh... Of course. But I'll need a while to rest up, I think.
Philby: Since I'm already here, I've got to pay a visit to Sumeru City. The locals have told me that I should attend the festivals held there if I can.
Philby: For example, there's something called the Sabzeruz Festival, which celebrates the birthday of Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Philby: But when I said "ah, so Lesser Lord Kusanali is also known as the Goddess of Flowers," they shook their heads and said that they are two different gods.
Philby: I don't understand. Then why is Lesser Lord Kusanali's birthday called "Sabzeruz Festival"? They're just being obtuse, aren't they?
