Capac: Hah! Hey!
Capac: Hey there, are you helping me keep count?
Yatlan: Of course! I come from a business family. Wouldn't it be weirder if I didn't know how to do that?
Yatlan: C'mon, there's just one-third of the training assignment left to complete.
Capac: And one-third is... How much?
Yatlan: Oh, don't worry about it. I'll remember it for you. You just concentrate on your exercise.
Yatlan: Hurry it up! Once you're finished, we can go chow down on some volcano cake!
Capac: You got it! Volcano cake always tastes best after training!
Yatlan: Wrong! Volcano cake is great to eat any day of the week!
