# Watatsumi Sightseeing


## Talk 1

Fatui Skirmisher: Comrades! They've set the ship on fire!
Fatui Skirmisher: An arson attack!? Curse them!
Fatui Skirmisher: They leave us no choice but to attack! Comrades, let's make them regret it!

## Talk 2

Paimon: If we do find the merchant's goods in the hands of the Fatui, it'll prove he's innocent.
Paimon: Whatever's going on between the Fatui and the Tenryou Commission, we need to get to the bottom of it!

## Talk 3

Arisawa: *yawn*... Peace at last... Livin' the dream...
Arisawa: Hmm? Don't I know you...?
Arisawa: I've definitely seen you somewhere before... Can't place you, but I'm guessing you're not with the Shogun's Army. So, do you need something?
Traveler: I hear people are feeling unsettled at the moment...
Arisawa: Unsettled? ...Unsettled how? I haven't noticed anything.
Arisawa: Not that I would, necessarily. I keep to myself mostly. They're all too rowdy for me.
Arisawa: We're at peace now, finally, and I for one intend to make the most of it. My life right now is about two things, and two things only: the sun and the sea breeze.
Arisawa: *yawn* Sorry that I can't be of more help to you. I'll tell you someone you could ask, though — Sangonomiya. She knows everything.
Paimon: Huh... Seems he's about to fall asleep. Let's leave him to rest and go find someone else to ask.

## Talk 4

Yoshihisa: Ugh, I don't understand what Her Excellency is thinking. I mean, peace talks? Gimme a break. Why would she agree to that?
Tsuneo: Exactly... everyone knows you can't trust the Tenryou Commission. I heard they've been secretly coordinating with the Fatui and plan to continue their attacks.
Yoshihisa: Wait, for real? You're sure of this?
Tsuneo: Positive. Some of our guys had a run-in with a few Fatui. They caught them conspiring together, first-hand.
Yoshihisa: I knew it! The Tenryou Commission are a bunch of crooks — they'll never change. Honestly... it's kinda naive of Her Excellency to take them at their word, isn't it?
Tsuneo: Shh, keep your voice down, someone's coming.
Paimon: Hey there, whatcha talkin' about?
Yoshihisa: #Oh, uh, Captain Traveler? You're back!
Traveler: I'm here to join you at the Victory Feast.
Yoshihisa: Do you think we should tell the captain about what we were discussing just now?
Tsuneo: #No, let's not mention it. {F#She}{M#He}'s one of her closest advisers. For all we know, the peace talks could have been {F#her}{M#his} idea...
Yoshihisa: I'm sure the captain would see where we're coming from... But you're right, we should probably play it safe.
Yoshihisa: Uh, welcome back to Watatsumi Island, Captain! Nothing to report here, everything is A-OK!
Tsuneo: Her Excellency should be in the village at present. Head straight over if you wish, Captain!
Paimon: Hmm, Paimon definitely detected some hush-hush going on there... But if they aren't gonna talk, we might as well head over to the village.
Traveler: What's new? Anything to report?

## Talk 5

Matsuda: Admit it! We know you've been secretly supplying the Tenryou Commission with goods purchased on Watatsumi Island!
Matsuda: I knew something was off about a Tenryou Commission merchant doing business here. So what do you have to say for yourself, huh?
Naruse: I'm innocent...
Uchimura: Ha! You're as guilty as they come. You never should've been allowed to set foot on this island, let alone do business here.
Uchimura: Take him away!
Traveler: Hold on, are we...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Wait!
Paimon: Kokomi! There you are!
Paimon: Something's going down over here, you should take a look, pronto!
Matsuda: Your Excellency! This merchant is suspected of criminal activity, so we seized him for questioning.
Matsuda: Our surveillance shows that in his whole time here, he has made numerous purchases but no sales. And yet he has no stock in his possession. We believe it's highly probable that he has been supplying the Tenryou Commission behind the scenes!
Naruse: I—I haven't... I...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: That will do. Let's not let ourselves get too worked up here, shall we? Everyone take a deep breath with me, in... and out... Better?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Matsuda, Uchimura — I understand that you're concerned for the safety of Watatsumi Island.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: But before we make any decision over whether this merchant is guilty or not, we must give him the chance to explain himself.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: If he's guilty, of course there will be consequences. But if he's innocent, he doesn't deserve to be falsely accused. This is Watatsumi Island. We deal in facts, not opinions.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Excuse me, Sir. As you know, my subordinates have some concerns surrounding your commercial activity here. Perhaps you could explain your side of the story, to help me reach a verdict?
Naruse: Of course, I can explain everything!
Naruse: I'm a trader on the island, so naturally I've built up some inventory. I was planning to hold off on selling until the prices went up, but then... Uh, ahem.
Naruse: Uh... Oh, oh! But then, I was robbed by the Fatui. They took everything! Think about that! First I lose all my inventory, then I get treated like a criminal...
Uchimura: Hmph. And why should we believe you?
Traveler: On the way here...
Uchimura: So what? That doesn't prove they took his goods!
Uchimura: And even if they did, it'll still end up in the Tenryou Commission's hands. They're in this together!
Naruse: What? The Tenryou Commission are colluding with the Fatui now? ...That's the first I've heard of it!
Naruse: Suppose it is true — what's that got to do with me...?
Paimon: Would the Tenryou Commission start colluding with the Fatui after the fighting's already finished? Hmm, seems unlikely to Paimon.
Paimon: We met a representative of the Kujou Clan recently. It doesn't seem like he'd have the time to be colluding right now.
Paimon: But on the way over here, we accidentally-on-purpose overheard some soldiers mention the exact same thing. Kokomi, do you know anything about it?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It has been brought to my attention, yes.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: We are scheduled to begin peace talks with the Tenryou Commission soon. The Kamisato Clan has arranged for them to take place in a neutral location.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Kujou Sara and I will be accompanied by our guards. We will use the talks to discuss future plans in detail.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: But just as arrangements for the peace talks began to fall into place, I started hearing rumors of collusion between the Kujou Clan and the Fatui. Allegedly, their goal is to completely wipe out Watatsumi Island.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: If that is the case, then the peace talks are likely a trap. Even the Kamisato Clan could be involved...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Sir, are you quite certain that your goods were stolen by the Fatui?
Naruse: Yes, it's the truth, I swear! They stole my goods and then ran off that way. I'll bet that's where their hideout is!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Very well. Hmm... The potential ramifications of this incident are serious. We will retrieve your goods and if everything is in order, it will prove your innocence.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: However, if we find evidence to corroborate the claims of collusion between the Fatui and the Tenryou Commission, I expect you to fully comply with our investigation. Do we have an understanding?
Naruse: Yes, of course! Thank you, Your Excellency.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Matsuda, Uchimura?
Matsuda: Well received, Your Excellency.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Good. Now, Traveler— I mean, Captain of Swordfish Platoon, Section II, would you join me in the investigation?
Traveler: Sure thing.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hehe, good... I look forward to seeing how you've progressed lately.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ah... I also have a few new things to teach you. Alright, follow me.
Traveler: Ma'am, yes, Ma'am!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hehe, at ease, soldier! For the time being, at least, we are in peace time.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Besides, I'm sure you won't be on Watatsumi Island forever. Whatever titles we may have, we're friends first and foremost.
Traveler: We ran into some Fatui...

## Talk 6

Paimon: This should be where Kokomi said to meet her.
Paimon: Do you still remember this place?
Paimon: Paimon remembers we came by here last time we visited Watatsumi Island.
Paimon: That was back when you did your stint as Captain of Swordfish II. Paimon's curious whether the resistance troops still remember you...
Paimon: Things on the island must have changed a lot since then! Shall we take a look around?
Paimon: Hey, isn't that Gorou? Let's go see what he's up to!
Gorou: If the enemy outnumbers you, seek their weakness and exploit it. If you outnumber the enemy, seek unequivocal domination and crush them...
Gorou: Marauders on the waterfront are supplied by sea. Burning their ships is the path to success...
Toshihiko: General Gorou, Sir. Do you have a verdict?
Gorou: More or less. From the directives left behind by Her Excellency, we can surmise that a Fatui ship is moored nearby. This explains their aggressive posture.
Gorou: We could split into two teams — one to draw their attention, the other to circle around behind enemy lines and set fire to their ship. They'd have nowhere to run!
Gorou: Then again, Her Excellency made clear that we are not to split up without sufficient forces. We'd risk being picked off one by one until our whole line of defense disintegrated...
Koutoku: Sir, shall I send for reinforcements?
Gorou: I doubt there's time. Based on their movements, they'd likely be gone before our troops arrived.
Gorou: Her Excellency's directives also stipulate that we should "Wait in ambush and avoid making the first move." Since we lack sufficient troops, I don't think we can afford to engage the enemy at this time.
Toshihiko: Sir... We're just going to stand by and watch them leave? Surely there must be another way!
Gorou: ...Her Excellency's directives also state: "Help may arrive when all seems lost..." As for where this help is supposed to come from, I—
Paimon: Hey, Gorou! What're you guys up to?
Koutoku: Captain! You've returned to Watatsumi Island!
Traveler: Here to lend a hand.
Gorou: #That's great! Her Excellency's directives are as reliable as ever... Traveler, you've arrived just in time.
Gorou: Recently, the remnants of the Fatui forces have been unusually active. We've been monitoring their movements waiting in ambush here.
Gorou: Unfortunately, we don't have the manpower to split into two teams. Can we ask you to keep them occupied?
Paimon: Hard to say no when it's the Fatui. Whatever they're planning, we won't let them get away with it.
Gorou: Good! There's not a moment to lose. We'll go behind enemy lines and sabotage their ship. Let's meet back here afterward.
Gorou: Watch yourselves. We'll be back shortly.
Paimon: Seems like the resistance still remembers us! C'mon, let's help them get this situation under control!
