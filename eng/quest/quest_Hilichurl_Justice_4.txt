Paimon: Ella is comforting that hilichurl...
Traveler: A true empath...
Ella Musk: It was... bullied... by someone very nasty. We need to help it vent its anger. That's all it wants.
Hilichurl: Dada!
Ella Musk: Yeah!
Paimon: Yeah!
Traveler: Assuming no translation is needed for that...
Ella Musk: Okay then, the location is marked on your Map — I'll leave the next part to you!
Hilichurl: Dada, Valo!
Traveler: But I don't understand a word they're saying...
