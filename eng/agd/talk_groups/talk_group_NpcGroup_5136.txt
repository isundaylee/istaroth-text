Traveler: About Salt...
Galathee: Hello. Are you here to discuss matters related to the supply of salt?
Galathee: Then you must have a lot of salt prepared, right?
Traveler: Salt is ready.
Traveler: Not yet.
Galathee: It won't do to be without salt. Every time our ship sets sail, we need to stockpile enough salt for our journey.

Traveler: About your next route...
Galathee: My first mate and I haven't really made plans just yet, but I do hope that we'll make it a little further.
Galathee: Each time I return to land and look back upon the route that we just took in this manner, I can't help but sigh...
Galathee: Even the longest of sea routes is still all too short when seen from on high.
Galathee: Perhaps one cannot traverse every river and every ocean in a single lifetime.
Galathee: But since I've chosen this path... You never know what you'll encounter unless you try, right? Haha.

Traveler: Could you tell me about the "prophecy"?
Galathee: Although there have been instances of rising water levels in our history, I'm inclined to focus on my current life and what I'll do before the prophecy comes to pass.
Galathee: I mean, everyone must return to their home and set their feet on solid ground one day, after having departed on countless voyages.
Galathee: As for distant dangers like prophecies, I think it's best left to long-lived beings such as deities.

Traveler: About the prophecy...
Galathee: About that... I heard that when the prophecy occurred, the chaos was worst around the opera house. Romaritime Harbor was too far away, and all sorts of rumors were flying around.
Galathee: Some people said that the Hydro Archon did all she could to prevent the ultimate disaster, while others said it was Monsieur Neuvillette who resolved it...
Galathee: Well, seeing as Lady Furina has, indeed, left her post, I'm leaning more towards... the former statement?

Traveler: Like the constant adventures.
Galathee: Yes, my friend, precisely.
