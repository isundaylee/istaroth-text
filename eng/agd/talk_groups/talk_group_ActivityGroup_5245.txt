## Talk 0

Helka: I'm ready any time.
Traveler: Let's head to the challenge location.
Traveler: I've got other things I need to do at the moment.

## Talk 1

Helka: The commission is complete. If you still want to challenge these gigantic creatures, however, I'm more than willing to come along.
Traveler: Let's head to the challenge location.
Traveler: I've got other things I need to do at the moment.

## Talk 2

Helka: Ready to tangle with the giant crab?
Traveler: I'll get prepping now.
Traveler: Let's talk a bit first...
Helka: Nod-Krai is also home to crabs, but they look very different. Hmm. I should take a few more photos — for all I know, Maisie might like Fontainian crabs better.
Helka: But then again, I wonder... Is the appearance of a species like this a result of the hot spring, or is it the Tyrant's presence that caused the springs to boil?
Traveler: Tell me a bit about Nod-Krai...
Helka: If I had to describe it, I'd go with "a dangerous yet lively place"? It's been leaning toward the former in recent days, though.
Helka: Before I left, the Fatui had moved a lot of construction materials in. Word was that a Harbinger — or Harbingers — were present, too. As for what they intend, I couldn't say.
Helka: I've heard bad things about the situation to the north as well. The Abyss's influence has been expanding... Katya even warned me not to return via the northern paths.
Traveler: Give me a moment.

## Talk 3

Helka: Ready to rumble with the giant ball of water?
Traveler: I'll get prepping now.
Traveler: Let's talk a bit first...
Helka: So, the will of water can also manifest itself in such a form... Inconceivable. It really doesn't look as though it lacks a soul.
Helka: Katya once told me a story about a fisherman who fell in love with a spirit of pure water, but such entities have no souls, and thus the fisherman set out on a journey to discard his as well...
Traveler: Could you tell me a bit about Katya?
Helka: She used to be a great adventurer back in the day, and her exploits took her all over the world. Eventually, her injuries led to her retirement, after which she settled down in Nasha Town.
Helka: She's always taken good care of us, and gave me lots of practical advice before I set out... I have immense respect for her, and am also immensely grateful to her.
Helka: Oh, right! If you get the chance, you should definitely try her cooking!
Traveler: Give me a moment.

## Talk 4

Helka: Ready to clash with the giant centaur statue?
Traveler: I'll get prepping now.
Traveler: Let's talk a bit first...
Helka: This device was created by an ancient civilization, I believe. It appears like nothing so much as a musician on a stage. The society that created it must have been impressive indeed.
Helka: Katya said that Nod-Krai was also once home to an ordered and prosperous civilization, one that you can catch glimpses of from time to time.
Traveler: I'd like to know a bit about this "Nod-Krai"...
Helka: Well, about that... Nod-Krai is actually part of Snezhnaya, and once upon a time, they performed lots of large scale development in the area.
Helka: But you can't find hide nor hair of that nowadays — unless you're talking about the mechanical scrap you can see everywhere.
Helka: But maybe that's precisely why Nod-Krai's become the bustling place it is today.
Traveler: Give me a moment.

## Talk 5

Helka: Ready to take on the giant mechanical monster?
Traveler: I'll get prepping now.
Traveler: Let's talk a bit first...
Helka: I've seen relics of a similar stripe in Nod-Krai... Yeah, on the island where the Frostmoon Scions gather...
Helka: But they're all as dead as dead can be, so this is the first time I'm seeing one move the way this one does. Fascinating — I'll record this and tell Maisie all about it.
Traveler: So, who are these "Frostmoon Scions," again...?
Helka: They're a... weird bunch, I'd say? They're not like the people of Nasha Town at all, the way they live in the wilds and forests most of the time.
Helka: Word has it that they worship some moon deity, and you can find statues they've made all over Nod-Krai. As for the rest, I don't really know — Katya's warned me not to look into them too much.
Helka: But what I have seen them do is magic. It's a shocking sight, I'll tell you that.
Traveler: Hold on.
