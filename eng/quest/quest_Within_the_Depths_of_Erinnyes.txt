# Within the Depths of Erinnyes


## Talk 1

Pahsiv: Key, statue, key, statue, key, statue.
Paimon: Do you mean... that we need to put the keys in the statues? Well, that sounds about right. Three keys, three statues...
Paimon: Shall we give it a try?
Traveler: What happens after we place the keys?
Pahsiv: Door opens, open door...
Paimon: Door? Where? And what's behind the door?
Pahsiv: Root, Erinnyes, very deep...
Paimon: A door to the root of Erinnyes? You know so much, Pahsiv!
Pahsiv: Pahsiv, protect!
Traveler: What else do we have to know?
Pahsiv: ...Huh?
Paimon: You know, like information! The more the merrier! The more we know, the more confident we will be!
Pahsiv: In...formation? In...formation... Pahsiv! Information, a lot!
Paimon: Great!
Pahsiv: Erinnyes, information, lots of.
Paimon: Lots of information, uh huh.
Pahsiv: Information, water vein, lots of.
Paimon: Lots of water veins, right.
Pahsiv: Water vein, visitor, lots of.
Paimon: Hmm... Hmm? Visitor? Lots of? Wait, Paimon doesn't get it. Where do all these visitors come from? Or are you telling Paimon that the visitor knows how to create mirror images of themselves?
Pahsiv: Melusine!
Pahsiv: Water vein, visitor, taste.
Pahsiv: Evil, visitor, sense.
Paimon: Tasting the evil in the water vein? Err, what kind of flavor is that?
Traveler: The visitor can sense information through the water veins?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv!
Pahsiv: Willow, collect. Fog, handle. Spring, send.
Pahsiv: Root, water vein, center.
Traveler: So, Erinnyes is the center of information?
Paimon: Are you saying that all of Erinnyes is the visitor's information system? And this visitor can sense something bad?
Pahsiv: #Smart Paimon! Smart {NICKNAME}! Pahsiv!
Paimon: Gosh, who is this visitor named visitor?
Pahsiv: Fontaine, visitor, protect.
Pahsiv: But, visitor, very busy.
Pahsiv: Purple thing, sneaking toward the root. Purple thing, secretly destroying the root.
Pahsiv: Pahsiv, peek. Pahsiv, secretly scratch the stone tablet.
Paimon: So you're the one that removed the writing from the stone tablet! Was it to stop the purple thing?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv! But...
Pahsiv: Purple thing, kept going toward the root. Purple thing, very powerful.
Traveler: The purple thing found another way?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv!
Paimon: Looks like this purple thing's a tough customer. If the root is destroyed, then the information system will fail to function, and the visitor's senses will be affected.
Pahsiv: Pahsiv, duty! Pahsiv, protect!
Pahsiv: #{NICKNAME}, ka-pow. Paimon, ka-pow.
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, we can't wait anymore. We need to ka-pow now!
Traveler: Alright then, Pahsiv! Open the door!
Paimon: Excellent. Let's go!

## Talk 2

Keratry: Brother! Look! There seems to be a hole in the fountain. Was that your magic?
Remaudiere: ...Uh... Yes, that's right! That was your brother's magic, indeed. Awesome, right?
Keratry: Yup! I didn't think you'd have a trick that's as good as the Great Magician Lyney's!
Remaudiere: Ahem...

## Talk 3

Pahsiv: Root... Root...
Paimon: We're finally here! Whoa, that's a whole load of funky stuff. Paimon doesn't see anyone around, but she's getting a familiar feeling... Evil's gotta be lurking nearby...
Pahsiv: Willow... Root...
Paimon: Are these the roots of that great tree from earlier?
Paimon: Paimon gets it now! That's why the great tree looked so sickly. The roots have been corrupted!
Pahsiv: Root... Melusine...
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, let's clean up all this filth. Paimon reckons they're corrupting the roots.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Ugh, this is tough. This pollution's impossible to clear up!
Pahsiv: Pahsiv, ka-pow!
Black Screen Text: Pahsiv touches your stomach with her hand, and you feel a warmth coming from her palm.
You feel like something in you has been enhanced.
Pahsiv: Pahsiv, tired...
Paimon: #What did Pahsiv do? You look revitalized, {NICKNAME}!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Finally, it's all gone. Paimon didn't know that you had such a marvelous ability, Pahsiv...
Paimon: Now... Wait... Something's lit up on the ground... It's some kinda arcane formation!
Paimon: Agh! Rifthounds are charging out!
Pahsiv: Purple thing...
Paimon: Don't worry, Pahsiv. We'll protect you!
Paimon: Wait! Where are you going, Pahsiv? Stop! This place is dangerous!

## Talk 6

Paimon: #Phew! Finally, that's that under control. We sure kicked the Rifthound nest, huh? {NICKNAME}, how are you doing?
Traveler: I can do this all day.
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon's sure that wasn't just you boasting. It looks like the roots are recovering â€” guess that means the problem here has been cleared up, right?
Paimon: But what happened just then? A vishap turned up to help, and Pahsiv disappeared...
Paimon: Hey! Pahsiv! Are you there? Can you hear Paimon?
Paimon: Okay, looks like she's really disappeared.
Traveler: She's got plenty of secrets, for sure.
Paimon: Hmm... She's such a mysterious Melusine. Paimon knows she didn't want any reward, but it still seems odd to just leave like that...
Traveler: Why?
Paimon: It's as if... It's as if you had a favorite food, and then one day, the food looks at you and says "guess we're through."
Traveler: That would be upsetting, yes.
Paimon: Well, it's the same kind of feeling, y'know? But what if Pahsiv was injured? She seemed exhausted...
Traveler: Maybe we can look for her nearby.
Paimon: Yes! Paimon thinks we should do that. Just in case she might be in danger, and all!
Paimon: Wait... What's wrong!?
Black Screen Text: Just as you are about to look for Pahsiv, water floods into the cave, sweeping you toward the surface.
Traveler: Although talking food seems even odder.
Traveler: My hands are just a bit sore.

## Talk 7

Pahsiv: Key, statue, key, statue, key, statue.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Oh no! We didn't get a chance to look for her!
Traveler: Don't worry. I'm sure she can swim.
Paimon: That's true, but... Whoa! Look at the great tree!
Paimon: It's recovered, and it's so pretty! Is that what it looked like before? Pahsiv will be happy if she sees it, won't she?
Pahsiv: #Paimon! Pahsiv! {NICKNAME}! Pahsiv!
Paimon: Pahsiv? Great! Where did you go? We were so worried!
Pahsiv: Disappeared, Pahsiv.
Pahsiv: Ah... Box. Pahsiv!
Paimon: What? Is that a treasure chest? You went looking for treasure chests?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv! But, shiny, round, Melusine...
Paimon: You didn't find any Mora? That's fine. The chest is more than enough!
Paimon: You remembered what Paimon told you! Oh, you're gonna make Paimon cry! Thank you, Pahsiv!
Pahsiv: Thank... you...?
Traveler: It means Pahsiv!
Pahsiv: #Paimon, thank you! {NICKNAME}, thank you!
Pahsiv: #Paimon, good thing! {NICKNAME}, good thing!
Traveler: Pahsiv, good thing!
Paimon: Pahsiv, good thing!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, we should come to see Pahsiv often when we have time, and teach her more words, like the visitor did.
Traveler: Pahsiv!
Paimon: What do you think, Pahsiv? Can we come back to play with you?
Paimon: Where did she go this time?
Traveler: Pahsiv, disappeared!
Paimon: Wow! Paimon has never seen a Melusine like her. Or rather... She doesn't behave like a Melusine, but more like a wild fairy.
Paimon: Maybe that's why she can spy on the purple thing quietly.
Paimon: Hey, Pahsiv! Goodbye! If we meet again, we'll teach you how to say goodbye properly!
