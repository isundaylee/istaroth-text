Hornshroom Augury Ad: "O visitor from afar, have your eyes grown dim? Have you lost your way? Come into the Hornshroom Augury, and I will lead you to your answer."
Silken Handwriting: "Master Chicomexochitl, I am a merchant from Fontaine. I would like to ask you: Where should I go to find personal happiness?"
Hornshroom Augury: "Chase not a vague remoteness, but stop and gaze around you. Happiness may be found there, glimmering brightly like gold."
Silken Handwriting: "Thank you so much, Master Chicomexochitl. I understand now â€” the Mora gleaming in my pocket here is the source of my happiness! Indeed, it was right beside me all along..."
Hornshroom Augury: "Even though any normal person could see that's not the point I'm trying to make... I'm still glad that you're happy."
