Traveler: (The owner of Yukio's stall has a good head for finance, and has had Ramen Cards made for rare and honored customers. This card therefore serves as a status symbol when you go for some ramen, and also lets you eat as much as you please.)
Traveler: (It's just a shame that this offer only applies to the ramen that goes with fried tofu.)
