Traveler: It was nothing.
Hosseini: No need to be so humble. I would never have been able to wrangle with those monsters who had stolen those samples.
Hosseini: With that data on hand, I reorganized my research into a report that tackled the problem of "how to use the Energy Amplifier to conduct energy conversions."
Hosseini: The Akademiya rated my report quite highly. I believe that they must recognized the academic value of this line of inquiry.
Hosseini: I even daresay that this research has filled in a large gap in our understanding of the Energy Amplifier.
Hosseini: It is of great comfort to me that its value was finally recognized by my seniors in the academic world.
Hosseini: With that under my belt, I can be said to have graduated successfully. I will not stop here, of course.
Hosseini: I've applied to look into a new research topic. I believe that as long as I keep working at it, I will receive the requisite acknowledgment for that work.
Hosseini: One day, I will make Dastur... maybe even Herbad!
Hosseini: And that's why I'm here in Inazuma, of course, to work on this new topic. It's just a shame that I got stranded here on Ritou before I could make any headway...
