Traveler: How are your travels through Liyue going?
Soraya: Great! The ruins and history are fascinating, as are the local customs.
Soraya: I mean, a lot of local customs are also derived from history. I've learned a lot just from studying them.
Soraya: Take, for example, this particular record of Liyue wedding customs, which was written about in Customs of Liyue: Flower Ball by a scholar from Sumeru.
Soraya: If it interests you, do take it and have a look. It's very fascinating indeed.
