Granny Ruoxin: Hello there, Traveler. Welcome to Qingce Village. Have you come to listen to the opera?
Granny Ruoxin: The fireworks from this year's Lantern Rite have been most lively, and everyone here has been in high spirits. I, too, wanted to add something new to the experience this year. So, I invited Yun Jin to perform here in our village.
Granny Ruoxin: Her operas preserve the operatic traditions of Liyue while often coming up with fresh stories. It is truly a new experience each and every time.
