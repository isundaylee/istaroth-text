## Talk 1

Traveler: Goodbye.
Hanayama Kaoru: Goodbye. *sigh* Where oh where can I find some flower seeds...

## Talk 2

Hanayama Kaoru: If only I could plant more flowers...
Hanayama Kaoru: Ah, hello! Nice to meet you... Excuse me, are you a returning resident, too? I'm sorry, I don't think I've seen you before...
Traveler: Returning resident?
Hanayama Kaoru: Mm-hmm, the residents of Tatarasuna were evacuated to other places because of the Mikage Furnace incident.
Hanayama Kaoru: Some time ago, I heard that everything was now alright with the Mikage Furnace and that Tatarasuna was safe, so I went to ask if I could come back.
Hanayama Kaoru: After I got the approval, I packed up all my things and moved back here.
Hanayama Kaoru: But... apart from me, there don't seem to be many other people willing to move back...
Hanayama Kaoru: But that can't be helped.
Hanayama Kaoru: After all, what happened to the Mikage Furnace was very serious. Everyone's worried that it could happen again.
Traveler: Aren't you worried, too?
Hanayama Kaoru: Of course I am... but I'm the sort of person who gets very homesick when I'm away too long. I couldn't stop worrying about my flowers, hehe. So despite everything, I just had to come back.
Hanayama Kaoru: Unfortunately, the flowers I planted around here before have all withered. It's a pity I can't find any more flower seeds right now...
Hanayama Kaoru: This place is very suitable for planting flowers. No matter what seeds you sow, before you know it they'll bloom into a sea of blossoms.
Hanayama Kaoru: I've grown flowers from overseas before, too. Mondstadt's Small Lamp Grass, Windwheel Asters and Dandelions, as well as Liyue's Silk Flowers.
Hanayama Kaoru: Small Lamp Grass looks really pretty at night. It needs to be planted in the shade, watered a lot, and the tips of the dead leaves need to be pruned.
Hanayama Kaoru: I've heard that Windwheel Asters grow well where there is wind. We get wind in Inazuma, but I doubt that it's as strong as the wind in Mondstadt... So I'll often go over and fan them with a paper fan. I'm not sure if it really helps, though.
Hanayama Kaoru: Dandelions are the least of your worries — they basically take care of themselves... sometimes a little too well, in fact. Leave them to their own devices, and they end up growing all over the place...
Traveler: So true! Anyway, I—
Hanayama Kaoru: Liyue's Silk Flowers, on the other hand, now they're a lot of work. Onikabuto love to crawl inside their petals, and I have to pick them out one by one.
Hanayama Kaoru: I tried growing Qingxin, too, but those were a complete failure. The ones that I planted either didn't grow at all, or withered quickly. Ahh... I wonder if there's a magical land somewhere in this world where flowers of every kind can grow smoothly...
Traveler: Who can say. Now, I—
Hanayama Kaoru: Oh, and did you know that there's a type of flower called "Violetgrass" in Liyue? It's really hard to find. I've asked a lot of people for help, but—
Hanayama Kaoru: Ahem...
Hanayama Kaoru: Ah! I'm sorry! I get like this whenever I talk about flowers, I'm really sorry!
Traveler: You're quite the flower connoisseur...
Hanayama Kaoru: I'm just an amateur flower lover, really, hehehe... but I don't even have any seeds right now, so I can't grow any flowers at all...
Traveler: I'm not a resident here.
Hanayama Kaoru: Oh? Is that so? I thought maybe I'd found someone else like me who was willing to move back...
Hanayama Kaoru: The population of Tatarasuna was evacuated to other places because of the Mikage Furnace incident.
Hanayama Kaoru: Some time ago, I heard that everything was now alright with the Mikage Furnace and that Tatarasuna was safe, so I went to ask if I could come back.
Hanayama Kaoru: After I got the approval, I packed up all my things and moved back here.
Hanayama Kaoru: Apart from me... there don't seem to be many other people willing to move back...

## Talk 3

Hanayama Kaoru: Where oh where can I find some flower seeds...

## Talk 4

Traveler: Are these flower seeds any use?
Hanayama Kaoru: Hmm...? Oh, wow! Yes, of course they are! With these seeds, I'm sure I can grow a lot of flowers!
Hanayama Kaoru: Uh, umm, sorry, please wait... I have to give you something in return...
Hanayama Kaoru: These are for you. Thank you so much for the flower seeds! Come visit again some time in the future, and I'm sure you'll see a beautiful sea of flowers!

## Talk 5

Traveler: What are you doing here?
Hanayama Kaoru: I was wondering where I could find some flower seeds, so that I can plant flowers around here again.
Hanayama Kaoru: The population of this island was evacuated during the Mikage Furnace incident.
Hanayama Kaoru: I moved back after I heard that everything had been resolved.
Hanayama Kaoru: But all the flowers I planted around here have withered, and I can't find any seeds anywhere. What a pity... this is the perfect place for planting flowers...
