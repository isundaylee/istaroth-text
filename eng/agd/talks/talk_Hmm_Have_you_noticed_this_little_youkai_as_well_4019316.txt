Inagi Hotomi: #Hmm? Have you noticed this little youkai as well, Traveler?
Traveler: This is a youkai too?
Inagi Hotomi: That's right, though it only seems to have become one very recently — it lacks the power and intelligence to speak just yet. Still, it appears to have been attracted by the festive atmosphere.

Traveler: And show my little "junior" the sights!
Traveler: Huh, and here I thought it was a street lamp...
