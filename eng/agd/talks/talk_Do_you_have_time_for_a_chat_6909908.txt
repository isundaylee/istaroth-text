# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Do you have time for a chat?
Emilie: Of course. As long as I'm not keeping you from anything.
Emilie: Why don't you pick a topic?
Traveler: Would this place work as a perfume studio?
Emilie: Ah, well, since you asked... Forgive me for being blunt, but I'm afraid not. The scenery here makes it a great place to live. But, it's missing quite a few necessities as far as a perfume studio is concerned.
Emilie: Perfumes have very strict storage requirements. It takes a lot of dedicated equipment.
Emilie: Of course, there's nothing stopping you from bringing the place up to spec. If you did that, it could make a fine studio space indeed.
Traveler: You seem like you're good at focusing.
Emilie: Well, I'd have to agree with you there. It's very true.
Emilie: My work requires a high degree of precision. So, it's a good thing that I excel at staying focused.
Emilie: Staying focused for three to five hours at a time is pretty easy for me.
Traveler: Got any tips for improving concentration?
Emilie: You're not the first person to ask me that question. Some people even believe certain perfumes can help you stay alert or increase productivity.
Emilie: But, unfortunately, that's just wishful thinking.
Emilie: Certain fragrances can have a temporary relaxing effect on people, but long-term exposure to strong scents actually has a negative effect on the brain.
Emilie: If you want my personal opinion, beyond being well-rested and sober, the best way to improve concentration is to minimize exposure to external stimuli.
Emilie: Before you begin a task, you need to remove all distractions and make sure your environment is suited to long hours of uninterrupted work.
Emilie: If you ignore those two factors, you're setting yourself up for failure, no matter what your mental state is.
