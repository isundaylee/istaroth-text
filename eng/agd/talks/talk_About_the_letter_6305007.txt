Traveler: About the letter...
Yoh: You mean that letter? It almost caused a misunderstanding back then, and I apologize for that.
Yoh: After our daughter left again, that letter constantly reminds me and her mother of her.
Yoh: I often take it out and read it. Thank you so much for bringing the letter to us. Thank you, truly.
