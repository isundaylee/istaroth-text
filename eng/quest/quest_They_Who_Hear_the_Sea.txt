## Talk 2

Locked Chest (Paimon): It opened! Let's have a look at what's inside!

## Talk 3

Locked Chest (Paimon): Aw, it didn't open... Looks like we didn't enter the correct code...
Locked Chest (Paimon): Let's listen carefully to the sounds that the conches make. Maybe those'll give us some clues.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Found it! Treasure, treasure... Wonder what'll we find inside...
Paimon: Eh? There's a lock on it. And it's coded, too... Looks like we'll need the code to open it...
Traveler: We can just shatter it, can't we?
Paimon: Wait! What will happen if the stuff inside breaks as well?
Paimon: Let's find a way to unlock it instead, shall we?
Paimon: But since this chest contains "family heirlooms" and is locked using a code...
Paimon: That's gotta mean that the person who locked it thinks that the code they left behind is easy enough to remember.
Paimon: Looks like our only chance are those conches that store sounds.
Paimon: Let's listen to the sounds inside those conches again. Let's hope that they can give us some clues about the code...
Traveler: Looks like we'll have to find a way to unlock it.
Paimon: But Paimon doesn't see any stone tablets, potraits, notes, carvings or notes nearby...
Traveler: There's a dearth of scholars, Treasure Hoarders, and adventurers, too.
Paimon: Yeah. Hmm... This is an unprecedented test!
