Fangju: Welcome to Hezhe Post. This is where the Communications Office conducts its business at Yilong Wharf. What can I do for you?

Traveler: What do you guys do here?
Fangju: The registration of people and goods entering and exiting, the inspection and, if needed, the quarantine of the above, applications for delivery within Liyue's borders, and ad-hoc goods storage — those are our four main tasks.
Fangju: Usually, outlanders who wish to do business in Liyue and who arrive at Yilong Wharf will come here to register their personal information.
Fangju: Our staff will then inspect and disinfect their goods.
Fangju: If you wish to transport goods to other locations within Liyue's borders, this is where you register.
Fangju: We will also evaluate the total quantity of goods and distances to destinations, and the manifests will be sent to transport units or our partners at the Secure Transport Agency, after which said secondary departments will do the actual transportation.
Fangju: If you have not yet planned a final delivery destination, you can also register here to have them stored temporarily in one of our warehouses.
Fangju: Of course, all this assumes you already have a formal business permit. If you need one, we can also serve as a proxy to help you apply for it.
Fangju: Of course, that would be a bit less efficient than doing it in Liyue Harbor.

Traveler: The Communications Office?
Fangju: If you want to better understand our duties, it might be best to consult the Ministry of Civil Affairs. I am just a lowly staff member, after all.
Fangju: To the best of my knowledge, our office is mainly responsible for transportation in Liyue. We are also involved, where appropriate, with related construction and road management, which is why we have a rather large number of staff.
Fangju: Good road networks, bridges, waterways, and docks are critical to transporting goods to various locations in Liyue, after all.
Fangju: Regardless of whether you're interested in traveling with a caravan, or have some talent in architecture, you're welcome to consider becoming an employee.
Fangju: And like me, enjoy the nice stable, peaceful life of an employee here in the office. It's not bad.
Fangju: Of course, the Office also conducts monthly performance evaluations to discourage negligence...
Fangju: So if you want to keep working here, you'll have to constantly improve yourself.

Traveler: I don't have any questions for you at the moment...
Fangju: Well, you might become a world-walking merchant for all we know — you'll have things to ask of us then, I'd expect.
