# Autumn Frost

Escoffier's inspired creation. Layers of swirling chestnut cream paint the outline of Mont Automnequi, while a dusting of powdered sugar nestles on top, like frost clinging to the mountain slopes. The powerful aroma of chestnuts blends perfectly with the light and airy cream, leaving you licking your lips for more. You might say that Escoffier has summited the pinnacle of the culinary arts with this one.
