Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Oh, it's you. Thank you for helping me clear those hilichurls out... Ahh, my nest is as warm as I remember! No more camping outside in the cold for me, no sir!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): You have the clue, yes? Well, I hope you find the treasure you seek.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Ah, you know... All those who bury their treasure wish for it to be found by people later on.
