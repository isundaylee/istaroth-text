Traveler: Nana.
Freeman: Oh, yeah. I remember that's the name of Autumn's dog.
Freeman: This dog's too delicate. Grew up in the city, after all, and not used to life in the wild.
Freeman: I was shocked the first time I heard Autumn say she liked to pick out clothes and necklaces for the dog when she was young.
Freeman: So rich that even the dog wears necklaces.
