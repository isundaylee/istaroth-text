Traveler: The glamor of Natlan?
Aikawa Susumu: Haha, it might be a little too much to call it "glamor"... Aisa Bathhouse is a hot spring inn in Inazuma that I founded after experiencing the volcanic hot springs in Natlan.
Aikawa Susumu: The healing power of a hot spring is unforgettable once you've tried it. After I returned home, I also wanted my friends in Inazuma to experience that same warm and comforting feeling.
Aikawa Susumu: I had no idea Aisa Bathhouse would become so popular. Even some big shots frequent this place, something that makes me regret setting the price so low. Haha.
