# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Are you working?
Nevida: Correct, the Bimarstan and neighboring areas are under my jurisdiction.
Nevida: Don't be nervous, I primarily monitor the doctors and patients, so there is no "inadvertent" breach of confidentiality.
Nevida: The Akademiya distributes information on a need-to-know basis through the Akasha Terminal, so extra leaks could cause unwanted problems.
Nevida: It would be great if you would work with our mandate and report anything unusual at once.
