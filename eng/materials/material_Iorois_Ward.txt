# Ioroi's Ward

A ward given to you by the bake-danuki Ioroi as a sign of thanks. It is shaped like a lovely comb.
Ioroi once stole this comb to lure "that sneaky kitsune" out. As punishment, Ioroi and his companions were sealed into graven stone by "that dratted fellow."
According to Hanachirusato, these wards are needed to conduct the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual.
