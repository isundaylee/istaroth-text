# Know Thyself, Know Thy Enemy


## Talk 1

Sturdy Wu: Who goes there?
Traveler: A Mondstadt merchant here for a meeting with Gentry Maocai.
Sturdy Wu: Really? He didn't mention anything about a meeting...
Sturdy Wu: The Master is dealing with some urgent business today. All prior appointments have been canceled.
Paimon: Urgent business? ...What is it?
Sturdy Wu: The Master has been working on a major business deal recently. He left early this morning to meet with a VIP client.
Paimon: So where is he now?
Sturdy Wu: I'm sorry, the Master has stressed that we must not disclose that information to just anyone...
Traveler: "Just anyone"? Are you saying we are not his VIP clients?
Sturdy Wu: N—No! I mean yes, yes you are! Ah... I—I meant no offense, please believe me...
Traveler: Take me to Gentry Maocai or suffer the consequences!
Sturdy Wu: I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Master is currently in business negotiations at Xinyue Kiosk!
Sturdy Wu: I beg for your mercy! Please, my master will show me no leniency if he finds out...
Paimon: Well, MY master has much more important things to do than talking to rude guards like you.
Paimon: Luckily for you, your bad attitude will be the last thing on our minds when my master's busy negotiating a big business deal with your boss!
Sturdy Wu: Th—Thank you, thank you! May your business forever be blessed by the Lord of Geo!
Paimon: #Nice work, {NICKNAME}! Paimon never knew you were such a tough negotiator.
Traveler: I was just bluffing.
Paimon: Is that so? Now Paimon knows not to let your wily ways get the better of her in future!
Paimon: Anyway, seems like the VIP client in question must be one of the Fatui.
Traveler: I think you're right.
Paimon: In that case, let's get ourselves over to the Xinyue Kiosk!
Traveler: This could work in our favor.
Traveler: You did great too.
Paimon: Tee-hee! Paimon loves compliments and all... but treating Paimon to some tasty snacks would show that you really mean it!
Traveler: Would you like to explain these extra fees you are incurring to your boss, or shall I?
Traveler: #I'm {NICKNAME}, a VIP client of your boss'!
Sturdy Wu: How strange, you're not on the guestlist...

## Talk 2

Gentry Maocai: I understand. I do. Please do not worry, you have my word that the order will be completed as promised.
Agent: Hmm... The subordinate I sent was not quite so optimistic in his appraisal. Is somebody being uncooperative?
Gentry Maocai: Ah... We just ran into a minor procurement problem is all. We haven't managed to purchase the Cor Lapis yet.
Gentry Maocai: But it's nothing for you to worry about. If Chang the Ninth won't sell, I can buy from someone else.
Agent: That would be most ideal. I remind you again that the Fatui care only about the result.
Agent: We are willing to lend a certain degree of support to this transaction. But if it is not completed in time...
Agent: You may suddenly find our good will comes at a price you cannot afford.
Gentry Maocai: I understand... I am indebted to you for your protection. You know I would not dream of disappointing you, don't you?
Agent: We shall see when the time comes.
Gentry Maocai: *sigh* Darn that old man Chang!
Paimon: So, Mr. Gentry Maocai is colluding with the Fatui!
Paimon: Who knows if Guhua Geek has made any progress. Should we go tell him?

## Talk 3

Paimon: Hmph! You said you had other things to look into, as if you're some sort of man of mystery...
Paimon: When actually all you meant was you wanted somewhere new to park your backside while you read your book!
Traveler: We know what Gentry Maocai's up to now.
Xingqiu: I see. I guessed as much.
Paimon: Did you really guess, or are you just saying that to sound clever?
Xingqiu: The course of action we must take is now clear. To start with, please deliver this letter to the Feiyun Commerce Guild. They will know what to do.
Xingqiu: My liege, for reasons that I cannot explain, I will be unable to join you.
Xingqiu: There is no need for you to read the contents of the letter, when the time comes—
Paimon: Whew, this writing is super hard to read! Paimon can't make heads or tails of it...
Traveler: It's in an ancient script, perhaps?
Xingqiu: Huh...
Xingqiu: Hence why I said there's no need for you to read it...
Xingqiu: The Feiyun Commerce Guild will have someone who can understand it.
Paimon: But why do you wanna get them involved? They're one of the bigwig commerce guilds in Liyue — why would they wanna help us?
Traveler: What is the Feiyun Commerce Guild?
Paimon: Since we got to Liyue, Paimon keeps hearing people mention it. Seems they oversee a lot of business that goes on around here.
Paimon: Having such big backing would be great and all... But are you sure they'd wanna help?
Xingqiu: No need to worry about that. From what I know, they share my sense of chivalry.
Xingqiu: Once they have read the carefully reasoned and passionately argued case I put forth in this letter, they will certainly be moved to action.
Traveler: How can you be sure?
Xingqiu: Gentry Maocai must be taught a lesson he will never forget. This is something we cannot do on our own.
Xingqiu: Also, I do not wish for anyone else to know of my involvement in this.
Paimon: Why not? You're only doing this to try and help Chang the Ninth, right?
Xingqiu: "To silently disappear at the matter's conclusion, concealing one's name and contribution," this is the chivalrous thing to do. To savor the memory is ample reward.
Xingqiu: Each droplet of kindness I receive I am duty-bound to repay with a welling spring of gratitude. I seek neither praise nor reward.
Paimon: That sounds very lovely. But be honest — you just want them to do it so you can carry on reading your book, don't you?
Xingqiu: Thank you in advance for delivering this letter to the Feiyun Commerce Guild. Someone from the guild should be able to receive you near Liuli Pavilion.
Paimon: Hey! Stop ignoring Paimon!
Traveler: Why get them involved anyway?
Traveler: A secret text that needs a cipher perhaps?

### Additional Talk 6

Paimon: So how do we find out whether Gentry Maocai really is colluding with the Fatui or not?
Traveler: We need to find a smoking gun.
Paimon: So... shall we just go look for him? Best-case scenario, we'll catch him red-handed; if not, we can try threatening him and see if he squeals.
Traveler: Let's speak to the guards first.
Paimon: Okay, boss! Whatever you say, boss!
Traveler: We need to catch him red-handed.
