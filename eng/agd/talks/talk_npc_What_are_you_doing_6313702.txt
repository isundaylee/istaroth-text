Traveler: What are you doing?
Kaushik: I'm a scholar from Sumeru, and I'm currently researching Watatsumi Island's culture and history.
Kaushik: I was here before the Sakoku Decree was declared, and I have remained here till now. In this time, I have discovered huge differences between Watatsumi Island and Narukami Island.
Kaushik: For example, have a look at this totem that I dug up from ruins in the wild. Studying these lines and patterns has led me to a marvelous conclusion!
