Collei: Whoa, did you two see that? A bird with huuuge wings just flew by!
Collei: If Master Tighnari was here, he'd be able to tell you its scientific name, species, and behaviors...
Collei: But as for me... all I can tell you is, it isn't a species we have in Sumeru...
Eula: Oh? Then what kinds of birds do you have in Sumeru?
Collei: Dusk Birds! They have the most beautiful, vibrant colors. The feathers on their chest are the color of ripe Sunsettias, and their wing-tips are the color of tender Mint leaves.
Collei: They're not too skittish around people, and at my tree holl— I mean, this tree that I often go past, there's a Dusk Bird there that always looks at me like it understands what I'm saying.
Collei: I once picked up one of its feathers from the ground, and it felt really nice...
Eula: You have keen observation skills, and a love for living things. You'd be better served directing your energies there rather than sighing and whining all the time.
Amber: Ugh, Eula says things in the most awkward way possible sometimes... Just ignore the second half, Collei!
Collei: No, it's fine, I know what she means. She does have a point...
Collei: Are you hungry for fish? I see quite a few over there.
Amber: Sounds like someone's up for a fishing contest, huh? Fair warning, though, I won't lose!
Eula: Seriously...? Another competition? I thought we were supposed to be sightseeing. ...Uh, but still — wait for me!
