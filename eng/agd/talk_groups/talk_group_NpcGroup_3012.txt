Traveler: So, do you have any ideas for kimono patterns?
Ramsay: Kimono patterns? Haha, I'm not exactly an expert on that.
Ramsay: But if I were to choose a design, I'd go with tea sets. Those would look neat on a kimono.
Ramsay: A kimono printed with a tea set design... Hahaha, now that certainly would have an Inazuman feel.

Traveler: Who are you?
Ramsay: I'm a merchant from Snezhnaya. I've been staying at Inazuma to get some rest.
Ramsay: The climate of Inazuma is warm and humid, and its cuisine is most exquisite. It's a far more forgiving place than Snezhnaya.

Traveler: How did you wind up here?

Ramsay: Well... Komore Teahouse only serves useful individuals. That's all I can say.

Traveler: How's business been?
Ramsay: It was quite good at first. Exotic items from faraway lands will sell well anywhere, after all.
Ramsay: But later on, the Resistance emerged in Sangonomiya due to the confiscation of Visions by the Shogunate. Business has gotten worse ever since that war started.
Ramsay: That just won't do. How can there be a healthy market in this environment? The way I see it, the Shogunate is stabbing itself in the foot... *sigh*
Ramsay: But though the current situation is grim, the weather in Inazuma remains very comfortable. And Komore Teahouse is very safe and secure. So all in all, I'm in no hurry to leave, haha.

Ramsay: But now that the Sakoku Decree has been abolished, I think things should pick up here again. I mean, life resurges wherever the blood flows, am I right?

Traveler: Do you often drink tea here?
Ramsay: Komore Teahouse is classy, has a fascinating view and is very cautious in choosing its guests. It is the best place for me to relax.
Ramsay: Walking around in the yard, watching the scenery and listening in to the chitchat of the guests are my favorite pastimes.
Ramsay: I have felt that I am being watched by somebody lately. It does creep me out...
Ramsay: But since I am already inside Komore Teahouse, I suppose I will be fine...
