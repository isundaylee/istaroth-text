Ever heard of the Hexenzirkel? As the spooky name suggests, it's a secret society
Once upon a time, it even challenged the Anemo Archon himself. But he replied:
"Let us make music, not war, and resolve our conflicts through song"
From then on, the mages would only ever convene
In the woods, in the skies, or on the edges of cliffs
At these tea parties, they discussed their stories and secrets and resolved their differences
As the tea and cakes bore witness to their pledge never to fight amongst themselves
Yesterday, I snuffed out the life of my beloved
He had grown old and was extremely sick
He loved me dearly, so I took his fate in my hands, and ended his pain
I'm raising a son
Of all the children I had, he's the only one left
But I suppose that still makes me a mother?
My lifespan is nothing compared to yours
So I wish to leave you with my storybook
Actually, maybe you can pass it on to your children one day
Ooh, this looks interesting. Let me scry!
My dear sisters, we mustn't let prophecies threaten our bonds of friendship
Even the most frightening witch was once a little girl
And growing up can be so tough...
Sometimes, we all need to vent our troubles to the wind
Even if the nations go to war
Or the sky falls down
The mages' tea parties shall forever be held around this table
