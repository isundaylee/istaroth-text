# Unagi Chazuke

A light and tasty main dish. Well-boiled tea is poured over rice with unagi on top and allowed to steep quietly until the rice grains have absorbed the fragrance of the tea. When combined with the lingering sweet aftertaste of the unagi, you can eat half a bowl before Paimon can say "Whoa!"
