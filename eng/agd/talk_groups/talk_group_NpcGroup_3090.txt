Sasaki: What's this Iro... Irodory Festival thing again? What's it supposed to be?
Sasaki: And there's a ton of people here too. I must admit that it's got me a little muddle-headed.
Sasaki: Still, it's good to see our pampered Lady do work out there, so I suppose I can't complain.

Sasaki: ...What is it?

Traveler: Who are you?
Sasaki: I am Sasaki, a subordinate of the Kanjou Commissioner.
Sasaki: ...A reminder for you, if you have any impudent ideas concerning Miss Hiiragi, you'd best watch out for the blade in my hands.

Traveler: Goodbye.
Sasaki: Bye.

Traveler: Miss Hiiragi?
Sasaki: As a daughter that he had in his old age, the Commissioner dotes on Miss Hiiragi. He even requested that a Chief Samurai such as myself be her personal bodyguard.
Sasaki: Heh... If I must be frank, that's truly a waste of my great talents.
Sasaki: That being said, since it's an order from the Commissioner, I shall still do my utmost.
Sasaki: Hmph, I've heard that many young punks inside the Commission have also been harboring mischievous thoughts about Miss Hiiragi...
Sasaki: ...No matter who it may be, I, Sasaki, shall not show any mercy if he oversteps his bounds.

Traveler: Who are you?
Sasaki: I am Sasaki, a subordinate of the Kanjou Commissioner. I am present in charge of our Lady's security.
Sasaki: Presently, she is a key member of the Kanjou Commission, so I cannot afford to be lax. Not in the slightest.

Traveler: How's Hiiragi Chisato doing?
Sasaki: After that whole hullabaloo, she seems to have completely changed, and has taken to settling the clan's affairs with great drive.
Sasaki: She has taken up all the things that would be the Commissioner's duties, and she has performed very well indeed.
Sasaki: She is very talented, this much I can tell. Though road ahead may be long... But I'm glad that she took this step forward.
