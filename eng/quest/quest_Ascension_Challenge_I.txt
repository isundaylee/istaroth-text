# Ascension Challenge I


## Talk 1

Traveler: I'm here for the Ascension Challenge!
Prince: Meow... (Hmm? Here for the Ascension Challenge? I see... You are indeed qualified for the challenge. Alright...)
Prince: "I'll have Shuyun set up the challenge for you immediately. Do be careful!"

## Talk 2

Prince: Meow! (How wonderful! Congratulations on completing the Ascension Challenge. You're now an Advanced player!)
Prince: Meow? (It only takes one challenge to become an Advanced player? Well, since most people play the game only for fun, they don't take it too seriously...)
Prince: (In other words, there are only a few people who are serious about the game, but even if it's just for fun, it's worth some serious dedication too.)
Prince: Meow! (Ah, yes! Now that you have my recognition, you can also challenge the games set up by the other guys in the tavern. Hmm... they should enjoy your company.)
Traveler: The other guys?
Prince: Meow. (You heard it right. Of course, they, just like me, are cats in this tavern. But they are not to be underestimated.)
Prince: Meow~ (Should the time come, Shuyun can hold cards for them. Alright. To honor the tradition, there's one more thing I've got to say!)
Prince: #({NICKNAME}, may the fun be with you in the world of Genius Invokation TCG!)

## Talk 3

Prince: Meow... (How unfortunate... Try to be extra careful next time and perhaps make some adjustments to your deck before your next attempt.)
Prince: (I believe you are capable of completing this challenge.)
