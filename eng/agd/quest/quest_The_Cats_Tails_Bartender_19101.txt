# The Cat's Tail's Bartender

Nimrod: Mmm... drinks at The Cat's Tail. Not bad... not bad at all...
Traveler: The Cat's Tail?
Nimrod: Oh hey, it's you, Traveler. ...Huh? Yâ€”You've never heard of The Cat's Tail?
Nimrod: Judging from your expression, seems like you really don't know the place. Boy, have you been missing out...
Nimrod: The Cat's Tail is renowned for its incredible specialty drinks. I'm talking drinks you've definitely never tasted before.
Nimrod: And just as its name suggests, there are loads of cute kitties at The Cat's Tail.
Nimrod: Time simply starts slipping away when you're enjoying a delicious specialty cocktail and surrounded by a bunch of cute kitties...
Traveler: Is The Cat's Tail still open right now?
Nimrod: Uh, but you don't seem of age to drink yet.
Nimrod: Well, that shouldn't be a problem, Diona will be there. She's the best bartender in all of Mondstadt!
Nimrod: It should be a piece of cake for her to whip you up a drink with no alcohol in it.
Nimrod: Oh, and not to mention, Diona is also pretty cute... just like a little kitty.
Nimrod: *hic* Oh no... did I say that out loud? Uh, please don't tell her I said that!
Nimrod: Anyway, if you want to check out The Cat's Tail for yourself, the entrance is just around the back.
Nimrod: I'm gonna... *hic* go over there and sober up a bit, I don't think I can handle a fifth round quite yet... I drank way too much already.
Traveler: I'd like to go check it out...
