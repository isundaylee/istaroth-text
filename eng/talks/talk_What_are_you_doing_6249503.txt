# Talk Dialog

Traveler: What are you doing?
Shikun: Tradition dictates that those who're in good health must help their neighbors once they're done with their own work.
Shikun: Uncle Luo, the village elder, arranges our shifts. Several of us are in the south, and several more in the north, so we're always prepared.
Shikun: If anyone needs help, they only have to talk to us.
