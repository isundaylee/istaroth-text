# Irodori Poetry: Part III


## Talk 1

Lenne: Ootomo's poem has really broken through the usual form of the Inazuman poem, yet it also uses its ancient style to depict all manner of unforgettable human experiences.
Lenne: Perhaps he means to say that although Mondstadt and Inazuma may seem greatly different, they do share some common aesthetics — just as how the two of us, despite being from these different nations, were able to bond as poets.
Ootomo: Ah, to think that you were able to grasp the feelings behind this verse so quickly, despite being so young...
Ootomo: I didn't believe in the idea of making friends of disparate ages from yourself before, but now I know that it is true. What a joyful truth it is!
Ootomo: #And you too, learned {F#young lady}{M#young man} — that we three should have met here... There must be some destiny at play.
Lenne: Indeed. The trip to Inazuma was a pretty bumpy one, but none of that matters now. Even when I return to Mondstadt, I will remember everything I've seen here in Inazuma.
Lenne: This is also thanks to the pictures you brought.
Ootomo: I hope that someday, we three shall meet once again.
Lenne: We will!

## Talk 2

Ootomo: Ah, you're here.
Ootomo: Lenne wrote of our regret that we did not meet sooner yesterday, and so today I wish to gift him a verse as well.
Lenne: Haha, it is my honor to accept such a gift!
Ootomo: Although I'm an old man now, after meeting friends from Mondstadt in recent days, I have grown quite interested in the place.
Ootomo: For this poem, I wrote in imitation of Mondstadt's bards, and the verse will also mention some of that land's scenery.
Ootomo: Unfortunately, I've never been to Mondstadt... But could you help me take a few pictures of <color=#00E1FFFF>Mondstadt's regional specialties</color>?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Ootomo: Haha, in that case, I'll be counting on you. Just like in the previous days, 4 pictures will do the trick.

## Talk 3

Ootomo: Well then, how are the pictures coming along?
Traveler: Have them right here.
Ootomo: Thank you, thank you. Ah, with these, I can finally pen a satisfactory poem down. Now then, let me think...
Ootomo: Here's my draft, written according to the pictures you brought back. Why don't you choose the stanzas we should use?

## Talk 4

Lenne: Connecting a flower to a lover is common to all nations, and this sentence compares remembering the sights of Inazuma to recalling one's first love.

## Talk 5

Lenne: The wild fruit in here must be alluding to some painful experiences. It is not a purely joyful memory, like the first taste of alcohol or the first reading of a poem, but it nonetheless leaves a deep impression.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Lenne: Indeed, using "tracing the wind's footsteps" as a metaphor for setting off on a journey is a very Mondstadt-like expression.

### Additional Talk 2

Lenne: This line says that though one may leave Inazuma, the things one has seen here will remain in one's heart forever.

### Additional Talk 3

Ootomo: Well then, how are the pictures coming along?
Traveler: I haven't finished taking them yet.
Ootomo: I'm sorry for troubling you. What we need today are pictures of <color=#00E1FFFF>Mondstadt's regional specialties</color>. Just as before, <color=#00E1FFFF>4 pictures</color> will do.
