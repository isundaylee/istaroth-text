Beatrice: I'm being serious, there really are heart-shaped Sunsettias around Cape Oath...
Quinn: Bea, your eyes must have been playing tricks on you. Sunsettias just don't grow into that shape. It's against the laws of nature.
Quinn: And even if they did exist, there's no way that they could be sweeter than the ones I'm already selling.
Beatrice: Well, why don't we just go over to Cape Oath to have a look? It won't take long...
Quinn: No. This has to do with my convictions! Using visual attraction to sell fruit is just a cheap trick. I would never do that.
Beatrice: ...Oh come on, why won't you just get it already...
Quinn: Hmm? Come again?
Beatrice: *cough* Uh, nothing... Come on, just consider it for a second!
