Ororon: #Traveler, could I trouble you to keep gathering the roaming spirits over the next few days? Just make sure to use this censer — Granny already applied her spell to it.
Traveler: About the spiritloom...
Ororon: Oh, you liked playing with that, huh? Feel free to try it again whenever you want. There should be some other clairvoyance records you can arrange on a woven scroll. It's pretty fun.
Ororon: Don't worry about Granny. I'm sure she only left it here so you can get some practice.
Traveler: About the Mare Jivari...
Ororon: The Mare Jivari? Terrible place to grow vegetables, for one thing.
Ororon: And if you're wondering how I would know that — well, it's because Granny told me. If you want to know more, you should probably ask her when she gets back.
Ororon: She has some scrolls on the subject in her house, but my rule is: If you can't grow vegetables there, I'm not interested. So I've never given them a second look. Truly sorry.

Leyla: ...

## Talk 2

Ororon: Something about this still doesn't add up for me... If that Kokuchuu guy was really plotting something, why would he leave Sanhaj's relic at the scene?
Ororon: Unless... That was also bait?

## Talk 3

Ororon: Thank you for everything. This would have been so much harder without you.
Ororon: These are for you. They're all home-grown. Hope you like them.

## Talk 4

Leyla: I'm going to apply myself hard, and learn everything I can from Ororon. He'll make a cabbage out of me yet.
Leyla: Although to be honest, I'd rather become a carrot... More nutritious, y'know.
