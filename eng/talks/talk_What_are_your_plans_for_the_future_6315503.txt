Traveler: What are your plans for the future?
Saimon Jirou: The future? Hah, do I look like someone who has a future to speak of?
Saimon Jirou: ...Hey, hey, I'm just kidding. After that near-death experience, I've become extremely optimistic about the future.
Saimon Jirou: I'm done with the adventuring though. My focus should be my family for now...
Saimon Jirou: It just so happens that many of the village fields have gone barren. I'll spend my time farming and living life like the rest of the people here.
