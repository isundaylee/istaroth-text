Traveler: Uncut rocks?
Master Hui: Huh, are you also interested in betting on rocks? Then you've come to the right man. Let me tell you how it's done!
Master Hui: You cannot judge the value of these stones based on their outward face. A real expert also knows how to use their nose!
Master Hui: This is deep water indeed. I would say that even with my prodigious talents, it took me at least eight years of practice to really grasp the technique.
Traveler: So, have you struck gold?
Master Hui: Well... I've just been unlucky!
Master Hui: If it wasn't for Xi's constant nagging that my father was coming to catch me, which affected my judgment... I would definitely have figured it out!
Master Hui: See, I would have chosen that yellow one! And if I had, would I still be in this state now?
