# Sharpening the Axe Won't Hinder the Work


## Talk 1

Wagner: What?
Traveler: I'm looking for a weapon.
Wagner: Over there. Take your pick. Or, if you need something else I can make it on request.
Paimon: Wow, he does bespoke weaponry...
Wagner: Of course. I sell weapons, make them to order, and do refinements. All in the job description for a blacksmith.
Wagner: All you need is the ore.
Traveler: Where can I get ore from?
Wagner: Anywhere. Everywhere.
Wagner: You look confused. Listen, I'll tell you where the nearest deposits are.
Wagner: Bring some back and I'll help you forge what you need.
Traveler: Great. Thanks!
Wagner: No need. I have other things to do.
Traveler: Do you sell it here?
Wagner: No. Buy from someone else, I barely have enough for myself.
Traveler: I want to find a weapon for Paimon.
Paimon: This is the first Paimon's heard about it! What, so you want Paimon on the front line now!?
Wagner: She's a tiny one isn't she. It'd need to be purpose-built.

## Talk 2

Wagner: What do you want?
Traveler: I've got the Iron Chunks.
Wagner: Oh. Yes. I'd forgotten about that.
Wagner: These are okay I guess. Should be able to salvage something from them.
Wagner: I'd like something made
Traveler: Remember, you sent me to get Iron Chunks...

## Talk 3

Wagner: If you ever find ore in the future, you can always come and see me.
Wagner: Ideally when I'm not busy.
Traveler: You seem to be in a bad mood.
Wagner: A blacksmith's work takes focus and concentration. It does not take small talk with customers.
Wagner: When the craft is good, business is good. That's all there is to this trade, and anyone who tells you different is trying to con you.
Wagner: If there's nothing else, I'll carry on with my work.
