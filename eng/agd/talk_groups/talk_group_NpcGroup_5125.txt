Alcina: If you hadn't told me, I would never have known that he was in this line before.
Rege: Heh. I mean, it's not completely unreasonable. Doing dirty business doesn't mean you don't accumulate experience, right?
Rege: Now he's changed jobs to some sort of financial consultant, mentioning a few "investment trends" to the Boss every so often for some easy Mora. Pretty sweet deal.
Alcina: Agreed. Speaking of which, I'm reminded of some kid who wasn't able to join the Spina di Rosula.
Alcina: Had a silver tongue, he did, but no real ability. Lately, I've heard that he's gotten mixed up in another faction, and he's been walking with a real swagger since.
Rege: Ooh, that's dangerous behavior, ignoring the Palais Mermonia like that â€” reckon he'll be "invited" to sing at the opera soon enough.

Rege: ...Hi, do you need any help?

Traveler: Are you alright?
Rege: Haha... Guess I must look pretty bad, eh?
Rege: There are too many things to do in town these days which require strenuous labor. I'm a little beat, so I'm just taking a rest.
Rege: I used to have someone to talk to when taking a break, but now... Forget it, best not to think about that.

Traveler: I'm okay. You take care of yourself.
Rege: Eh, fine.

Rege: Hello. Would you like to chat?

## Talk

Traveler: Sure. Anything you want to talk about?
Rege: Hmm... I've been so caught up with the town's reconstruction work that I've been blind and deaf to everything else...
Rege: But now that I'm free, I find myself disinterested in gossip and the like.
Rege: I should find something to do and keep myself busy. It's the only way to keep my thoughts from running wild.
Rege: It would be nice to sail across the ocean to somewhere else or get some other new hobby.

Traveler: Sorry, I've got other things to do right now...
Rege: It's fine, go ahead.
