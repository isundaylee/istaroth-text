Little Meng: Agh! I—It's too spicy! W—Water! I need water...
Paimon: Looks like we put too many Jueyun Chilis in, huh...
Little Meng: Phew... Alright, we're fine now...
Little Meng: Other than the spiciness, I honestly think that this dish was pretty tasty.
Little Meng: And the spiciness definitely did, uh, keep me alert.
Traveler: I guess a few less Jueyun Chilis couldn't hurt anyone.
Little Meng: Thank you, Traveler! I'll make sure to memorize how to make this dish.
Little Meng: Once Dad and I are on the road, I'll find an opportunity to cook this for him!

Traveler: As long as it tastes alright...
