Traveler: What is this place?
Azalai: As you can see, you can purchase food and spices here.
Azalai: Aaru Village's soil is not well suited for growing anything, so the lion's share of our goods are imported.
Azalai: But waiting for others to source goods felt like too passive an approach, so I set this store up.
Azalai: In any case, I'll be forward with you — I've nothing to hide in any case — and say that the prices here will be higher than what you'd get in the city.
Azalai: It's just how things are... This is as low as I can go when you factor in the costs for one-way shipping.
Azalai: That said, you don't have to pay me in Mora. If you've brought something to barter, I'll hear your offer.
