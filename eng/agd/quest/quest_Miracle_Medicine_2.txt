# Miracle Medicine


## Talk 1

Anthony: This one looks normal enough...
Traveler: You look quite well.
Anthony: Yes, well, I guess I was just giving myself a fright.
Anthony: Anna's looking better by the day. This doctor really is the real deal.
Anthony: If you're willing, could you help me find more ingredients? This time, we need a Wind-Caressed Aster.
Traveler: That doesn't sound like medicine.
Anthony: Well, Windwheel Asters are sometimes used in medicine, but it's usually used to heal minor ailments.
Anthony: Maybe the Anemo Slime is the key, but Windwheel Asters and Anemo Slimes aren't really seen together often.
Anthony: Luckily, Jack has seen this happen a few times before, and he has related their rough locations to me. Let me mark the latest one out on your map.
Anthony: I can't deal with Anemo Slimes since they can fly, so I can only turn to you!
Traveler: This is quite like Mondstadt.
Anthony: I wouldn't argue with you, but Windwheel Asters and Anemo Slimes aren't seen together often.
Anthony: Fortunately, Jack has seen this happen a few times before, and he has related their rough locations to me. Let me mark the latest one out on your map.
Anthony: I really can't fight Anemo Slimes, since they can fly, so I can only count on you!
Traveler: I'll just catch an Anemo Slime for you.
Anthony: You just want to watch me embarrass myself, don't you?
Anthony: Nonetheless, Windwheel Asters and Anemo Slimes aren't seen together often.
Anthony: Fortunately, Jack has seen this happen a few times before, and he has related their rough locations to me. Let me mark the latest one out on your map.
Anthony: If you really can't find it, then bring an Anemo Slime back. I'll do anything for Anna.

## Talk 2

Anthony: Have you found it yet?
Traveler: No, not yet.
Anthony: Well, it is combat we're talking about. Take some time to prepare, and I'll see you again.

## Talk 3

Anthony: Have you found it yet?
Traveler: Got it.
Anthony: Huh. This Windwheel Aster does feel different from normal.
Anthony: Hahaha. Don't ask me why, but I have a feeling that if Anna eats this medicine, she will certainly get well.
Anthony: Maybe her recent improvement's been getting my hopes up.
Anthony: All the same, thank you so much. Take this as compensation for your trouble.
Traveler: Hope Anna gets well.
Anthony: Thank you. She will.
Anthony: I have always believed so.
