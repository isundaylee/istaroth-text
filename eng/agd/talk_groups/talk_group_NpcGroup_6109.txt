Traveler: Is more work good?
Amauta: It depends on what kind of work you have to do. For me, having more work is undoubtedly a good thing.
Amauta: Well, you see, I'm the one responsible for making and repairing sports equipment for our tribe.

Amauta: And, well, the more business I have, the more people there are hoping to get their hands on my equipment.
Amauta: But that's always better than having no customers at all.
