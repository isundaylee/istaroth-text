Traveler: So you're the take-out person?
Agemo: Yeah, but strictly speaking, I'm only on duty when there are matches taking place in the Stadium of the Sacred Flame.
Agemo: Some spectators wear themselves out with all that cheering, jeering, and jumping around, so it's only natural they start wishing they had something to eat or drink.
Agemo: That's where I come in, moving around the stands, taking orders, then running off to buy and deliver their stuff.
Agemo: The spectators don't need to pay me any extra â€” Mr. Cipac pays me a regular wage.
Agemo: And when there aren't any matches on, like now, I get to rest.
