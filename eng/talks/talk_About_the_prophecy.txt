Traveler: About the prophecy...
Augereau: I never thought the prophecy would actually come true! Although, it didn't turn out quite as expected...
Augereau: Can't really say I'm disappointed though, more like happy! After all, even if the flood caused some trouble, we Fontainians didn't really dissolve.
Augereau: Palais Mermonia had arranged an emergency plan before disaster struck, so we escaped the worst, thank goodness.
