Traveler: What are you singing?
Nima: It's a song I wrote myself!

Nima: Raranana, Raranana, when will I see you again!

## Talk

Traveler: Who's Raranana?
Nima: Small, round friends.
Nima: Raranana would appear when the adults aren't around, just like me slacking off farming work.
Nima: But Minoo always made fun of me all the time for believing in Raranana, and got mad at me for saying the name wrong.
Nima: I've seen Raranana with my own eyes, though... They're the weedfolk, so Raranana does exist for sure.
