# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Same as always?
Shani: You could say so, but it does also feel like something has changed.
Shani: I mean, I still talk and do things the same way, but I feel a lot more relaxed, you know?
Shani: Take what's happening now, for example. I can say this, and I really mean it â€” I really envy you for your traveling lifestyle.
Shani: If I had the chance to go to a place where no one cared about the Dendro Archon or King Deshret, I think I would have been a lot freer.
