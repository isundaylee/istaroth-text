Yanfei: ...
Yelan: Are you alright? You've suddenly gone quiet. It's not like you at all.
Yanfei: Shh, we'll talk later. I'm just processing all the existing clues we have.
Yanfei: Maybe the key to our escape is hidden in some detail I've overlooked... I have to go over everything again...
Yelan: Alright, well...
Yanfei: Oh, don't worry. I won't write down anything that you told us about.
Yelan: No, I meant, if you're going to analyze the facts, count me in.
