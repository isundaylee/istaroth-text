Uncle Gao: How was business today, brother?
Uncle Sun: Here, let's just say this is a token of my appreciation, all thanks to your plan!
Uncle Gao: Haw-haw, they won't suspect a thing. This is all going just as I planned it would.
Uncle Sun: That's my Uncle Gao! There's no way anyone would ever remotely suspect that we're in cahoots. As soon as they compare our prices, they'll surely think that I'm the only one getting any business.
Uncle Gao: Hahaha! Come now, Uncle Sun! Bottoms up!
Uncle Sun: Here, let me fill that up for ya!
Uncle Gao: Aye! Tonight will be a night that we never remember, hahaha!
Uncle Sun: Enough talking, now drink up!
