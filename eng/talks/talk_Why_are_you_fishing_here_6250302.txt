Traveler: Why are you fishing here?
Wangjuan: Sorry, what? Speak up, I can't hear you~
Wangjuan: Hmm. Nevermind. I read your lips, and if I'm not wrong, you're wondering why I'm fishing by the waterfall â€” just as everyone else who's asked.
Wangjuan: See the shallow area over there? Some unfortunate fish come plummeting off the waterfall, dying the moment they crash into the rocks.
Wangjuan: I feel bad for them, but I can't let them perish in vain either.
Wangjuan: So I cook them into delicious dishes and eat them with gratitude.
Wangjuan: Thanks to them, I don't have to worry about food, nor do I have to catch other fish.
Wangjuan: If you look at the big picture, the number of fish that die in Chenyu Vale each day declines thanks to me, and that's a good deed, wouldn't you say?
Wangjuan: I only catch the fish that are destined to be baited, and I think of it as making friends...
