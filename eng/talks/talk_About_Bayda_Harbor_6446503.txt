Traveler: About Bayda Harbor...
Shajar: Bayda Harbor's a place where many influential forces criss-cross, but the peace has been kept so far â€” it's my job to make sure everyone stays in their corner, after all.
Shajar: So don't worry. Ordinary smugglers know better than to try anything cute here.
