# Kunado's Trial


## Talk 1

Daimon: I am Daimon of the Jibashiri. Hero of Sangonomiya, I acknowledge that you are worthy to take on this challenge.
Daimon: Valor is the power to defeat all your foes, regardless of the method used. Simply defeat all the opponents here and release the Flames of the High Gate, and you shall be allowed passage.
Daimon: It should be said that all these foes are illusions, born from the Sunfire Phantasms and the great enemies you know of in your heart.
Daimon: Even so, you will be vanquished if you are not careful.
Daimon: I will await your completion of the challenge at the Tower of the Three Realms above.

## Talk 2

Daimon: Have you completed the challenge, hero of Sangonomiya?
Daimon: To pursue true valor, use all the means at your disposal to defeat the foes before you.

## Talk 3

Daimon: Yes, yes! Scatter them all before you!
Daimon: Such power can truly be considered "unmatched throughout Tokoyo"! I, Daimon of the Jibashiri, acknowledge your great valor.

## Talk 4

Uda: I am Daimon of the Jibashiri. I know not how you entered this place, but please leave.
