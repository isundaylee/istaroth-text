# Prince Qubad's Intaglio

An Intaglio that symbolizes the noble origins of Prince Qubad in the play. It should have been strung on a beaded chain and worn on the prince's chest, but a fated tragedy made the prince abandon it.
The blood-red jewel is a crystallization of the question Kaeya asked you â€” that age-old question about destiny.
There is no need to rush to answer. In the future, use what you see, touch, and feel to prove the answer within your soul.
