Traveler: How do you like it here?
Kachina: It's... It's all really nice! Don't worry about me. I can take care of myself.
Traveler: Sure you're not just putting on a brave face?
Kachina: Huh? No... of course not!
Kachina: What gave you that impression though? Was it my ears? My... facial expression? Or my body language?
Traveler: All of the above, really.
Kachina: I'm sorry! It's just... It's a completely new environment, and my body's taking some time to adapt.
Kachina: Thanks for your concern, but... I'll be fine. Really, I will.
Kachina: Oh — the weather here's really great, and there's such a peaceful atmosphere. I love it!
Kachina: I want to adjust as quickly as possible, and I also don't want you to worry about me, so...
Kachina: ...Could I stay here for a little longer? I won't cause a fuss! You won't even know I'm here!
Traveler: You can relax a little more, you know.
Kachina: ...You're right. Thank you for inviting me here. I'll... I'll try my hardest to relax!
Traveler: If you're "trying," you're probably doing it wrong... Just... relax.
Kachina: O—Oh, yeah. Good point...
Kachina: It's just... Your place is so nice, and your invitation made me so happy, I'm not sure what to do...
Kachina: M—Maybe I just need a little more time to adjust.
Kachina: I... don't travel often, and here, I'm surrounded by things I've never seen before! I almost forget to breathe just trying to take it all in...
Traveler: It's alright! You can do whatever you want here.
Kachina: Ohh, thank you! *sniff* You're so nice...

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Kachina: Sure! I'm not the chattiest person in the world though — not like Mualani... I hope that's okay?
Kachina: Uh... but, um... yeah! I can just listen, mostly! Whatever you want to talk about, it's fine with me!
Traveler: You really are the nervous type, huh?
Kachina: Uhh... Yeah, guilty as charged.
Kachina: I've failed so many times in the past, I'm constantly worried about messing things up again...
Kachina: I wish I could get everything right... I mean, not like a hero, or anything. I just... really want to live up to people's expectations.
Kachina: Oh! That reminds me, you've had a lot of amazing experiences...
Kachina: Do you ever get nervous? When you're in new place, or facing a new enemy?
Traveler: Of course I do. It's a perfectly normal response.
Kachina: Wait. You too? I thought I only felt that way because I'm weak...
Kachina: It's such a relief to hear you say that. I guess I've just been scaring myself silly all along, huh?
Kachina: Oh, or... maybe we're talking about different things. I mean, I get nervous-nervous, and maybe with you, you're just... anxious to appear modest?
Traveler: Nah. Everyone gets nervous. Sometimes, you've just got to roll with it.
Kachina: Roll with it... Hehe, that kinda makes sense! It's so simple when you put it like that.
Kachina: For me, being nervous is pretty much the default.
Kachina: But... I think I get what you mean. Maybe one day, I'll be able to be at peace with my nerves, just like you.
Kachina: Whoops — this was supposed be a light-hearted chat, but it's ended up being another mentoring session... Sorry, this always happens, doesn't it...
Kachina: If there's anything that I can do for you, please let me know!
Traveler: Not really. I'm used to it by now.
Kachina: I knew it! That's what makes you a real hero — staying calm, controlled, and rational whatever the situation.
Kachina: I guess I've just got to keep practicing so I get used to it too. Just like with my dancing!
Traveler: That's right. One step at a time, at your own pace — just like dancing!
Kachina: Exactly! I just need to go on a few more adventures... and get a few more wins under my belt... and then I'm sure to be less nervous.
Kachina: Would you mind taking me with you on some more adventures? Or... sharing some of your experiences with me in your spare time? I'll do my best to learn, and I'll definitely find some way to repay you!

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Kachina: Let me think. Hmm... Nope, nothing in particular.
Kachina: I'm quite content at the moment. In fact, it's more than that... I'm happy.
Traveler: You sure you're not just putting on a brave face?
Kachina: Hehe, of course not! I doubt I could fool you, anyway — you know me too well by this point.
Kachina: I'm really enjoying my time here. Once I got used to it, I realized that your home's kind of like a dream world... the kind of thing you read about in storybooks.
Kachina: It's not just the beautiful scenery, either. I love all this open space! It's so much fun just riding around the place on Turbo Twirly.
Kachina: The pace of life here is so nice, too. I could stay here forever.
Traveler: Glad to hear it.
Kachina: Heh~ Once again, thank you so, so much for inviting me here... My family's always telling me, you can never thank someone too much!
Kachina: By the way, would you like to visit my home sometime?
Kachina: ...Ah!
Traveler: What's wrong?
Kachina: N—Nothing... I just suddenly remembered all the piles of stuff in my room... I gotta take care of that before you come over.
Kachina: There's still a few boxes left under my bed... and my top shelves are empty... Yeah, that should do the trick.
Traveler: There's no need to tidy up for me.
Kachina: Oh... Thanks, it's really nice of you to say that! I... feel a lot more confident now.
Traveler: Relax, it'll be fine.
Kachina: Hehe, so it's decided then? I'll have every stone in its proper place by the time you arrive!
Kachina: And that's a promise! Even if it's crowded, it's still gotta look nice.
Traveler: A crowded house is a house with character.

## Talk 10

Kachina: I only just noticed how orderly all this furniture is.
Kachina: It must have taken you ages, surely? I bet it was tiring... Feel free to ask me to help next time.
Kachina: I can't promise I'd be any use with other stuff. But sorting and organizing is my specialty, so I'd definitely make things better and not worse!
