Traveler: Could I just look for you?
Mansa: In theory, of course. But most of the time I have to stay here to help adventurers who come for advice.
Mansa: There's no doubt that Ms. Katheryne is extremely reliable, but when it comes to all things Natlan, no one's more knowledgeable than us natives.
Mansa: And in terms of their abilities, the Scions of the Canopy or the People of the Springs would make even better tour guides than I would.
Mansa: As for me... Well, if you'd like, I can tell your fortune before you set off, I suppose?

Traveler: Do you have any commissions for me?
Mansa: There are always people who need help, all the more so after a war.
Mansa: But thanks to all the help we received from Katheryne and the adventurers, we now have a lot less on our plate.
Mansa: I even heard that some Fatui soldiers helped out with some of the work, which is almost unheard of. Very unusual indeed.
