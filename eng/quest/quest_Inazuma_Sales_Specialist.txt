# Inazuma Sales Specialist


## Talk 1

Vahid: This business is so hard. All my merchandise is good and they're the real deal...
Vahid: But why does no one here want to buy anything?
Traveler: What is the matter?
Vahid: Oh, it's you, Traveler. *sigh* Forget it. I still cannot sell any fertilizer...
Traveler: Don't you have Alrani to help you?
Vahid: She did help me out a little. But trouble is, neither of us knows how to promote these goods. We can only wait for the customers to show up...
Vahid: And you know about the situation in Ritou. Nobody is buying anything.
Vahid: So I visited the gentlemen at the merchant guild to ask for help, and they suggested that we do something called marketing.
Vahid: Simply put, they want us to talk more about the fertilizer's effects and the theory behind it with customers. We should also do more data-driven promotion, and we should offer a "free trial" service...
Vahid: But... I really don't understand such complex matters. And I'm not the one who created this fertilizer, so how can I possibly explain it?
Vahid: Anyway, even if it's just reciting the instructions, I believe I'll still need to run around and do some promotion.
Vahid: Alrani is already out there promoting our goods. I am going out later as well. Traveler, could you please help us out?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Vahid: Excellent! We are counting on you, Traveler.
Vahid: The place you are going to is called Konda Village. It's not far from here.
Vahid: There is a gentleman named Konda Densuke who has shown some interest in our fertilizer. He also came to the store to chat with me a little earlier.
Vahid: If you could promote some of our goods at his place and offer him a free trial, he might just buy some fertilizer.
Traveler: Where did Alrani go?
Vahid: She said that she needed to collect some materials and that she'll have to go quite far away.
Vahid: The place you are going to is called Konda Village. It's not far from here.

## Talk 2

Traveler: So, tell me how to use the fertilizer...
Vahid: Oh yes, right, I haven't explained it to you yet. The fertilizer you are taking there must be used in a certain way.
Vahid: Now, let me see... according to the manual, the order should be...
Vahid: You must first add <color=#37FFFF>water</color> to the fertilizer, before adding some <color=#37FFFF>crushed leaves</color>. Finally, <color=#37FFFF>mix them well</color> and apply it to the field.
Vahid: Don't get the order wrong, or it may cause problems, which will affect our customers' impression of us. Our future business is at stake...
Traveler: I remember.
Vahid: Then I'm counting on you. Once you deliver the Anahitian Blessing to the customer, his first payment will be yours to keep.
Traveler: Could you repeat the process again?
Vahid: You must first add <color=#37FFFF>water</color> to the fertilizer, before adding some <color=#37FFFF>crushed leaves</color>. Finally, <color=#37FFFF>mix them well</color> and apply it to the field.
Vahid: I'm counting on you, Traveler... Let's all work hard. With any luck, business this month might be good!

## Talk 5

Konda Densuke: Youngsters, we meet again. What would you like to know this time?
Traveler: I'm not here to ask questions this time.
Konda Densuke: Oh, did Vahid send you?
Konda Densuke: I heard about a novel fertilizer shop in Ritou. That's why I went to meet Mr. Vahid to try out his fertilizer.
Konda Densuke: If it works and increases crop production, there might be hope for restoring Konda Village.
Konda Densuke: Heh, I guess it is still up to an old relic such as myself to restore the village. Those young lads from the village... Hmph! You can't count on them.
Konda Densuke: Alright, tell me then. How should I use this fertilizer?
Traveler: Add water first, then add crushed leaves before mixing them up.
Konda Densuke: Such a complicated procedure for fertilizer... Alright, I've got it.
Traveler: Add crushed leaves first, then mix them, and add water at the end.
Traveler: Add crushed leaves, then add water, then mix them up.
Traveler: I'm here to talk about how to use the fertilizer.

## Talk 6

Konda Densuke: That's what Vahid told me last time, too. It should be alright. I'll wait for the crops to grow.

## Talk 7

Konda Densuke: I've got a bad feeling about this somehow. It doesn't sound like what Vahid said last time. Are you sure there won't be any problems?
