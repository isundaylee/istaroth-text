Clorinde: I rarely encounter opportunities to rest mid-journey. During battle, slowing down is even more out of the question.
Clorinde: However, given that this is not a solo operation, I will go along with what you think is best.
Clorinde: In any case, this is an acceptable place for a brief period of respite.

## Talk 1

Clorinde: People often believe me to be highly focused on securing victories â€” I am a Champion Duelist, after all.
Clorinde: The truth, however, is just the opposite. It is the spirit of the challenger that I value above all else. If someone is willing to face me head-on, they have my respect, no matter who secures the title of victor in the end.
Clorinde: Strength is something that can be gained through experience. Courage, however, comes from within.

## Talk 2

Clorinde: I think I'll read a little before the next battle begins.
Clorinde: Please refrain from recommending something like a newspaper. I recognize that short-form articles may be a fitting choice considering the limited amount of time at our disposal...
Clorinde: But they're simply not to my taste.
