# An Expected Lie


## Talk 1

Raimondo: Any questions? Honorary Senior Researcher?
Traveler: What will happen to Nacker and Edwin?
Raimondo: They will temporarily stay at the Fortress of Meropide where they will repent for their misconduct.
Raimondo: That said, the Edwin I know doesn't do "repent."
Raimondo: No matter, as long as Edwin is kept away from research equipment and Arkhium.
Raimondo: As for Nacker... I don't believe he'll cause more trouble for us.
Raimondo: I... I can only hope I don't run into situations that would require their expertise...
Traveler: Did Fusilier use to worship Edwin?
Raimondo: ...Edwin Eastinghouse is a genius. People in the same field either gave up on themselves or became his followers.
Raimondo: Miss Fusilier is a very passionate and creative researcher, often achieving great results with minimal resources.
Raimondo: After joining the Tech Sect III of the Arkhium Research Project, she was put in charge of the structural design of the suppressor and had frequent run-ins with Edwin.
Raimondo: Maybe that's when she started idolizing Edwin. Just like the other followers, Edwin's approval became her only pursuit.
Raimondo: After the explosion, she refused to believe that Edwin was the one who caused it, so she applied to join the investigation in an attempt to clear Edwin's name.
Raimondo: Now that you've dealt with Edwin, what do you make of him?
Paimon: A freak of nature who cares only for his research! He always tries to push the blame to others, and he can't even remember Miss Fusilier's name!
Raimondo: That sounds like him, all right. Other than his research, there's rarely anything that's worth a second of his attention.
Raimondo: And he cares for nothing else as long as his research runs smoothly. Not even when his own subordinates stole the Institute's assets to sell.
Raimondo: I only approved Fusilier's application to join the investigation... so she would come to realize she was chasing an image of him she fabricated.
Raimondo: Now that image has finally been shattered, I can only hope she picks herself up soon... The Fontaine Research Institute cannot afford to lose more of its people.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Raimondo: Goodbye, Honorary Senior Researcher.

## Talk 2

Chaussivert: That scoundrel is right up there! Get him!
Nacker: Darn! Darn! Get out! One last step... One last step!
Paimon: #Traveler! Hurry! Get that liar! Wretch! Fraud! The most...
Paimon: Hmm... The THIRD most annoying person in the Institute!

## Talk 3

Paimon: A huge empty space with... nothing inside... Did we come up empty-handed?
Chaussivert: The plants have been intentionally cleared, and the trimming seems relatively recent.
Fusilier: ...All the trouble I went through for him...
Chaussivert: Anyway, I'll go down alone and take a look. You stay with Miss Institute Lady. If things get out of hand... take her and go.
Chaussivert: But there's nothing here. How could things get out of hand...
Chaussivert (???): Squeak! Beep beep!
Paimon: Whoa! Look out! Something's coming!

## Talk 4

Nacker: Institute dogs! How much did Choiseul and Raimondo pay you!?
Traveler: Just a title.
Nacker: You... You... Listen to me, let me go. My "Field Generator" is almost done.
Nacker: Once I successfully synchronize it with the Arkhium Kinetic Core, then... Then I'll be the greatest kinetic engineer ever!
Fusilier: ...Taking credit for someone else's work and claiming to be the greatest engineer. Shame on you.
Fusilier: Now I finally know why Mr. Ed... Edwin never wanted you to take part in the core research project.
Nacker: Edwin doesn't know a thing about what to do with it! You're also from the Institute... You know the true value of this thing!
Nacker: Help me! I can... develop it with you! Then, we'll both be famous, and incomparable!
Nacker: Edwin, Raimondo, Choiseul... None of them can surpass our fame!
Traveler: Looks like what Raimondo said was true.
Fusilier: Edwin... Mr. Edwin's achievements... belong to the Institute. I'm only here to claim them, nothing more, nothing less.
Paimon: Miss Fusilier... suddenly changed how she addresses Edwin.
Nacker: Don't be a fool, girl! You don't know what Concini can give us!
Nacker: We'll never get such benefits even if we run errands for Edwin for a million years! Edwin and the Institute only wanted to use us... We have to think for ourselves!
Fusilier: ...
Chaussivert: I had enough of this nonsense. Shut up.
Nacker: And who the heck are you!?
Chaussivert: The one who watches over Lumidouce Harbor. One more word, and you'll taste my fist.
Chaussivert: #Traveler, help me tie him up and take that core or whatever. It's time we head back.
Traveler: It must've been tough for you, Nacker, to hold all of that in for such a long time.
Traveler: Not one Mora. I volunteered.

## Talk 5

Nacker: Edwin... I knew it! You lured them over... You've always been jealous of me! Afraid that my research would surpass yours!
Edwin Eastinghouse: You're right. I am so jealous of how totally oblivious and ignorant you are. No wonder you led such a blissful life back at the Institute.
Paimon: Only if Choiseul was here to see this... He'd faint.
Traveler: He better never wake up.
Edwin Eastinghouse: You go back to the Institute with them and repent... I need to get back to my research... You didn't break anything, did you?
Traveler: Who said you can go back to your research!?
Edwin Eastinghouse: What are you gonna do? Take me back to the Institute? How am I supposed to continue my research, then?
Edwin Eastinghouse: That fool Raimondo will definitely turn the Institute into a mess. And that idiot Choiseul... Ugh! The mere thought of it gives me a headache.
Paimon: You're the one who turned the Institute into a mess! Stop shifting the blame to someone else!
Edwin Eastinghouse: Me? Fine. You want to blame me for the explosion at the Central Laboratory, right? But you know what? I wasn't even there!
Edwin Eastinghouse: The institute is full of fools! Even someone knocking over a cup of coffee can trigger an equipment malfunction, so I'm not surprised they managed to cause an explosion.
Traveler: Then why didn't you try to explain that to them?
Edwin Eastinghouse: Explain? I'm not gonna be their scapegoat. I have a lot of research on my hands, and my time cannot be wasted on them.
Chaussivert: And so you decided to get mixed up with the likes of Concini?
Edwin Eastinghouse: Oh, he's no better... He couldn't even get his hands on a piece of precision equipment. I had to do all the work. At least he's willing to fund the research, so everything went smoothly...
Edwin Eastinghouse: But I didn't expect our dear Nacker to come here with that incomplete core prototype.
Nacker: I've modified it! With my tech you can never develop!
Edwin Eastinghouse: Haha! Mr. Nacker, Concini is not here for you to suck up to, so why don't you stop lying to yourself? Don't you have an ounce of dignity as a researcher?
Nacker: You...! It's "incomplete" only because you don't know how to complete it! But I know how, and I can do it!
Edwin Eastinghouse: Right. Now, just take this piece of junk back to the Institute and keep leeching off it. I have something more important that requires my attention. You... Fusi-something, I'll leave this to you.
Paimon: Will those two ever stop arguing...?
Fusilier: ...Enough.
Edwin Eastinghouse: What? Can you stop wasting my time? I need to get back to work!
Fusilier: I said... enough!
Fusilier: Edwin Eastinghouse! You, you are the one who blew the Institute up!
Fusilier: And you, Nacker, you stole the Institute's assets!
Traveler: And blew the Institute up a second time!
Fusilier: Both of you harmed the interests of the Institute... As the special investigator of the Fontaine Research Institute, I am taking both of you back to the Institute where you shall be dealt with accordingly!
Nacker: Darn...
Edwin Eastinghouse: Oh, please...
Chaussivert: Lemarcq and I will escort those two back. Say, we've been the errand boys for a long time, so the Institute will definitely compensate us, right?
Chaussivert: Remember, keep your mouths shut along the way, or you might meet an early end.
Traveler: Stop right there! I'm warning you!
Traveler: I'm about to faint, too...

## Talk 6

Choiseul: #Miss Fusilier! Traveler! You're back! You must've handled things...
Choiseul: Oh, no...
Paimon: Whoa! Mr. Choiseul is really about to faint!
Edwin Eastinghouse: I didn't think you'd be back at the Institute, Choiseul. I figured you'd be stuck dealing with paperwork forever.
Choiseul: This... This is impossible! Goodness gracious!
Edwin Eastinghouse: Raimondo, how does it feel taking over my job? Anything worth reporting?
Raimondo: ...What a wonderful reunion, Mr. Edwin.
Edwin Eastinghouse: Ha! Look around you. You really do seem suited for janitorial work.
Nacker: ...Hmph! He didn't even clean it up properly.
Traveler: Mainly because he didn't clean you up.
Raimondo: #Thank you for bringing those two back, Honorary Senior Researcher Traveler, Miss Fusilier.
Raimondo: Hopefully, this marks the end of the Fontaine Research Institute's series of unfortunate events and turmoil.
Edwin Eastinghouse: Hahaha! Great. The Fontaine Research Institute will now fall into deathly stillness where all inspirations wither and die.
Raimondo: You certainly have already sparked much inspiration around the Institute. It's time to calm things down.
Edwin Eastinghouse: Raimondo Havenport, you know nothing about research. You are not fit to lead the Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering.
Raimondo: But I know how to keep it up and running properly, Edwin Eastinghouse.
Raimondo: What you need to do right now is to stay away from research and Arkhium. It's better for all of us.
Black Screen Text: Some time later, the Maison Gardiennage's personnel arrives and take both Nacker and Edwin. It is for the best that they finally leave the Institute for good...
Choiseul: Thank goodness, my nightmare has finally ended...
Choiseul: Mr. Chaussivert, Mr. Lemarcq, yes? I've heard about the assistance you rendered to our institute. Please take a well-deserved rest here while your compensation is being arranged.
Chaussivert: Hahaha! I didn't think someone like me would ever be associated with the Institute.
Choiseul: Don't say that about yourself, dear sir! You're sincere and kind-hearted, so you're definitely a good person. Maybe we'll enlist your help in the future.
Choiseul: As for you... Honorary Senior Researcher, you did us a great favor once again. How should we ever repay you?
Traveler: Just don't get blown up again.
Paimon: By the way... Where's Miss Fusilier?
Raimondo: ...We should give her some room to calm down. Looks like the image of Edwin Eastinghouse she had created in her head has completely shattered.
Raimondo: Edwin and Nacker need to calm down as well... I hope they can reflect on their own mistakes.
Traveler: Will they stay in the Fortress of Meropide all their life?
Raimondo: Judging by how dangerous they are, I hope they never leave that place.
Raimondo: However, given the state of things here at the Fontaine Research Institute... I can only hope I don't run into situations that would require their expertise...
Raimondo: I thank you again on behalf of the Fontaine Research Institute, Honorary Senior Researcher. If you have any further questions, I'm at your service.
Traveler: What about a promotion?
Choiseul: Well... theoretically, your current title already resides at the top... But let me see what I can do.
Choiseul: How about something like... Chief Honorary Senior Researcher? Hahahah!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Edwin Eastinghouse: Why are you... You're back again. Told you. You can try five times and still won't find him.
Edwin Eastinghouse: It's not working out for you, clearly, so why don't you just sit down and have some tea? I just bought five cups... and a few bowls.
Lemarcq: You really like the number "five," don't you, Mr. Edwin?
Edwin Eastinghouse: Yes! It's a magical number! Use it right, and you can unlock the doors to endless inspiration!
Edwin Eastinghouse: Listen up. There are five doors to endless inspiration, and you have to turn each handle five times... Five! You hear? Five times!
Lemarcq: Sorry, but I'm really trying to stop myself from punching you five times. Would you please kindly shut your trap?
