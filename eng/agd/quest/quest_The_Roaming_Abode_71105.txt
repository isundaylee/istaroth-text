# The Roaming Abode


## Talk 1

Paimon: #This should be the right way, Traveler. Let's keep our eyes peeled.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Oh? There's a campsite here. Could this have been where Xiangjun's grandfather stayed for a while?
Paimon: ...Let's see if we can find any clues nearby.

## Talk 3

Paimon: "Blessed waters," Paimon's foot! These waters don't look special at all...
Paimon: Oh, right. We forgot to ask Xiangjun where she lives in Qiaoying Village... Let's go back there and ask around!

## Talk 4

Uncle Luo: Since we're already talking about it, I should probably add that we never really knew the name of that herb gatherer.
Uncle Luo: He was an outsider, and we discovered that he was a bit... touched in the head the moment he arrived. He claimed that he'd picked divine herbs, but the pharmacy couldn't recognize them — much less buy them from him.
Uncle Luo: But he had no other skills, and couldn't make the Mora needed to feed himself, so he had to knock on doors to ask for help. We took pity on him, and decided to feed him. His house was also built using Mora the villagers pooled together.
Uncle Luo: Later, some ignorant children would call him an "adeptus" on account of his mutterings about "divine herbs."
Uncle Luo: Not the "Capital-A Adepti" who dwell in the clouds, I mean. Just an "adeptus" who could help protect the village from disaster.
Uncle Luo: No one expected something that terrible to happen to him afterward, but once it did, everyone thought that this must've been him repaying us by protecting the village!
Uncle Luo: Everyone thanked him, and thus people have been reliably caring for his own home. We're almost there, by the way.

## Talk 5

Uncle Luo: Ah, it's you, Traveler. You seem in a terrible hurry. Did some trouble come up?
Paimon: We... Well, do you know where Xiangjun and her grandfather live, Uncle Luo? We're looking for them.
Uncle Luo: Xiangjun? Never heard of her. Is she from around here? I'm sure I know everyone in the village...
Paimon: Really? That can't be... We met a little girl outside who called herself Xiangjun, and said she lives in Qiaoying Village. She asked us to help her find her grandfather...
Paimon: She also has a big bamboo raft!
Uncle Luo: Well, you can find those quite easily, but Xiangjun... I'm fairly sure there's no one by that name in our village. What does her grandfather go by?
Traveler: He's an herb gatherer.
Uncle Luo: A herb gatherer? Let me think. We did have one, so I recall... But it's been three years since he passed...
Paimon: He passed away!?
Uncle Luo: Aye. He encountered monsters in the wild and... *sigh* Still, I doubt that's who you're looking for.
Uncle Luo: He was always a little off his rocker, and he never got married, never mind having descendants of any sort.
Paimon: Wait... What's going on here? So, that Xiangjun we met...
Paimon: ...Could she have been the real demon!?
Traveler: What sorts of herbs did your herb gatherer, well, gather?
Uncle Luo: Flowers and grasses, none of which we've ever seen. 'Fraid I only know this and that about tea, so I'd be little help here...
Uncle Luo: But I do remember that we found him near Mt. Xuanlian. He was still clutching a bottle of water.
Uncle Luo: He said that he had a divine plant in his yard that needed that sort of blessed water to grow. Load of hogwash if you ask me — I mean, it's all just river water. Nothing special about it! Why'd he have to give up his life on account of something like that...
Uncle Luo: *sigh* Still, after we buried him, we poured the water he obtained out in that yard of his. I hope that brought him some solace.
Paimon: The blessed waters of Mt. Xuanlian? We went there and drew some water, too... So, this herb gatherer of yours...
Traveler: I think we're talking about the same person.
Uncle Luo: Well, that's strange happenings, and no mistake... Why don't you come with me? I'll take you to that fellow's yard.
Uncle Luo: If you did draw water, I suppose you can just pour it out in his yard.

## Talk 6

Uncle Luo: If there's nothing else, I'll leave you to look around as much as you'd like.
Paimon: So there really wasn't anyone named Xiangjun...?
Uncle Luo: I'll ask around. Maybe it was just a little mistake somewhere. Y'know, like someone forgetting where they live, and such.
Uncle Luo: In any case, thanks for helping that "adeptus" water the herbs. I'm sure he'll do what he can to defend you from harm as thanks.
