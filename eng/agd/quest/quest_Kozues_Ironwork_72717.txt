# Kozue's Ironwork


## Talk 1

Traveler: Interested in Iron Chunks?
Kozue: Are you here about my commission? If so, I guess you've already got those 10 Iron Chunks ready, right?
Traveler: Here they are.
Traveler: I haven't got them yet.
Kozue: Okay, well go get them, then bring them here.

## Talk 2

Kozue: Mm... yep, that's 10. I'll hand them to Taroumaru shortly.
