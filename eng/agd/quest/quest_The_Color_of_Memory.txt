# The Color of Memory


## Talk 1

Citlali: Now, when it comes to weaving the scroll itself, you don't actually need to lift a finger. But, if we're going to pass on Huitzilin's technique, your participation is critical.
Paimon: What are you saying, Citlali?
Citlali: Follow me.
Paimon: Whoa, look at this place... Do you weave scrolls, too?
Citlali: Scrolls...
Citlali: Scrolls? I thought you were going to show me your masterpiece?
Huitzilin: That I am, old friend. The technique I'm about to show you directly relates to woven scrolls.
Citlali: *sigh* Fine, what is it? Something that can turn the tide of war or prevent a great disaster?
Citlali: You probably want to challenge me, right? I know you don't have the strength for a real fight, so I'll let you beat me with words.
Huitzilin: *cough*... Old friend, my life is nearing its end. I'm afraid... I don't have time for another match.
Citlali: Hey...
Huitzilin: Don't worry. I trust in the belief of our tribe... that death is not the end, but the beginning of a new existence in the Night Kingdom, where everything is made of memories.
Huitzilin: So, do you know why our ancestors insisted on using colorful woven scrolls to record our history?
Huitzilin: Because... history is the memory of a people.
Huitzilin: We give our scrolls an orange hue so the dead can still feel the warmth of the setting sun.
Huitzilin: We decorate them with kernels of Grainfruit so the dead can still enjoy the abundance of our harvests.
Citlali: I know that... But, something this important? Why entrust it to me and not one of your students?
Huitzilin: Hehe, as your friend, I admit... I'm being a bit selfish.
Huitzilin: *cough* I don't have long, Citlali. I'm not sure... I can truly explain my decision. But, I know you will understand one day.
Huitzilin: For now... will you accept my final request?
Citlali: ...Just this once.
Citlali: I understand now, Huitzilin — just like you said I would... Claw, help me move this outside. I'm going to color it.
Tlapo: !
Citlali: #Traveler, Paimon, come with me.

## Talk 2

Citlali: We are like birds, soaring through the horizons of time...
Black Screen Text: (Package Video)
Citlali: I knew you would understand.
Paimon: This... This is the special scroll! How did you know how to weave it, Citlali?
Traveler: Remember the "gift from the spirits"?
Paimon: Hold on, you've lived for more than two hundred years, you know how to weave the special scroll — that must mean... You're the one behind the "gifts from the spirits"!
Citlali: Well, it's not like I wanted to interact with the appointed, so whenever I delivered the scroll, I used illusions to confuse them.
Citlali: The fact that it turned into some kind of "divine intervention" is because no one was skilled enough to see through my tricks...
Traveler: Why not just tell them?
Paimon: You've carried the duty alone for all these years? Even if you don't like interacting with people, why not teach someone else how to do it?
Citlali: #...Traveler, you can see the special color, right?
Traveler: Yes.
Citlali: The essence of that color is memory. That means completing the special scroll is a process of searching for color within your memories.
Citlali: Passing the technique on to someone means sharing your memories with them. You need to leave traces of your color in their memory, and they must do the same.
Citlali: Even though I only confirmed that today, I've had suspicions for a long time.
Citlali: And, well... ever since Huitzilin died, I haven't wanted to form that kind of connection with people.
Paimon: Oh, yeah...
Citlali: It was her final wish, so I kind of resigned myself to taking on the burden forever. After all, I have all the time in the world.
Tlapo: !
Citlali: But, Claw never stopped appointing new candidates to weave the scroll — despite knowing exactly how I felt about the situation.
Traveler: You mean, he never stopped trying to find new friends for you?
Citlali: ...I knew exactly what he was doing. And, yeah, if I ever did share my memories with someone, I guess that person would be a friend. But, it never got to that point.
Citlali: This time, though, you win, Claw.
Tlapo: ...
Citlali: Take this. I guess... it's my response to what you told me the other night.
Paimon: What is it?
Citlali: If I had to choose my color, it would be the color of this handkerchief.
Citlali: Countless people exist in my memories, and I know one day, that will be my fate, too — a memory living on in someone else's head.
Citlali: Since you have a long lifespan, you're the perfect candidate to bear this memory... and carry my color in your mind.
Traveler: Does this mean I'm officially your friend?
Citlali: ...Just keep it safe, and you better not forget my color when I'm gone.
Paimon: Whoa, it's a little early to talk about death, don't you think? It's only been a few seconds since we made the friendship official...
Citlali: Isn't that what friends are for?
Paimon: #Okay, this is a serious commitment... Well, Citlali, if Traveler's going to leave their color in your mind, too, it'll probably be gold, right?
Citlali: Actually, their mark is already there. Remember the mind-reading effect I couldn't fix? Well, I finally got to the bottom of it.
Citlali: Sharing senses allows communication to occur between the consciousness of different people. Naturally, memories are also involved in that process.
Citlali: Although I didn't know it at the time, we both have the ability to see the "color of memory," which means that when I shared my senses with you, a connection was created between our memories.
Citlali: And that connection is what caused my original spell to go haywire...
Paimon: #So... you can hear Traveler's thoughts because you left traces of color in each other's memories?
Paimon: #And that's why Traveler could hear your thoughts, too! Because it works both ways, right?
Citlali: Quick thinking, but only those trained in the mystic arts can maintain that level of connection.
Citlali: #That's why I can still hear Traveler's thoughts, but not the other way around.
Citlali: There's no need to worry, though. Now that I've figured out how it works, I'll get rid of it in no time.
Paimon: Oh...
Citlali: (I lied — hearing each other's thoughts actually depends on the strength of the connection between our memories.)
Citlali: (So, after everything we just went through, I bet you can hear me again.)
Traveler: (!)
Citlali: (I knew it...)
Traveler: (So, is there a way to stop it?)
Citlali: (Since the connection between our memories is already there, the only way to get rid of the effect is for one of us to forget about the other.)
Traveler: (...)
Citlali: (Heh, just messing with you... I'm a legendary shaman of my tribe, now that I know the cause, of course I can figure out how to fix it.)
Citlali: (It'll probably still take some time, though. So, bear with me for now.)
Citlali: (Besides, I'm an open book. It's not like you're gonna hear anything embarrassing... Oh, um, unless I've had a few drinks.)
Traveler: (Oh, so you can turn it off? That's a shame...)
Citlali: (A shame? I mean, if you ever miss this whole telepathy mess, I could always share my senses with you again.)
Citlali: (No promises, though. Some thoughts are better kept to yourself.)
Paimon: Uhh... Huh...?
Traveler: (Oh, so you can turn it off? That's good to hear.)
Citlali: (Yeah, I get what you mean. Some thoughts are better kept to yourself.)

## Talk 3

Biram: Ah, you did it? Your investigation into the Battle of Seven Colors must have been fruitful indeed. I do hope you share what you learned.
Caholom: Wow, the scroll is finished already!
Aywastin: Elder Tlapo's wisdom is never wrong!
Paimon: #Yeah, we should explain... Take it away, Traveler!
Black Screen Text: You share everything you learned about the special color while keeping Citlali's contribution a secret.
Biram: I see...
Paimon: You don't look surprised at all...
Biram: It makes perfect sense! History is the memory of a people. If we want to depict it, a dye derived from people's memories is, of course, the best choice.
Biram: Now, it's just a matter of preserving this secret technique...
Biram: Hmm... From your description, it sounds like learning the technique requires the previous holder to share their memories?
Paimon: Well, yeah...
Biram: In that case, I must work with our priests to re-invent the technique based on the principles you described.
Biram: #After all, memories are precious things — meant to be shared with those closest to us. I cannot take that choice away from you, Traveler.
Biram: You completed your task admirably. Finding a way to carry on that legacy is now our duty.
Paimon: Alright! We'll leave that to you!
Biram: Oh, and please pass along my thanks to Granny Itztli.
Biram: We interrogated the Fontainian merchant she apprehended, and it turns out, he is the reason some among our tribe started to question our history.
Biram: He hired people to spread misinformation about the Battle of Seven Colors. The recent friction within the tribe is entirely his doing.
Biram: We now have a record of his crimes and will begin working with Fontaine authorities in a few days.
Paimon: So, he was behind the controversy in the first place! Guess it's easier to investigate when people are already questioning something...
Paimon: Anyway, that clears it up! People don't just question their history out of nowhere.
Traveler: Thank you, Biram. We'll be on our way.
Biram: Until we meet again.

## Talk 4

Citlali: You told him everything, right?
Paimon: Yep! We left out the part about your contribution, but it kinda seemed like Chief Biram saw through us...
Citlali: You could have just said it was a "gift from the spirits"...
Traveler: Yeah, but Chief Biram deserved something in return for his hard work.
Citlali: ...I guess he is different from the previous chiefs. But, if he figures out it was me all these years, I'm in for a world of trouble.
Allier: There you are! I've been looking everywhere for you!
Paimon: Oh, it's the other Fontainian researcher... He wasn't taken away with his boss?
Allier: Please, call me Allier... After questioning, the tribe absolved me of any serious wrongdoing, so here I am.
Allier: I'll be heading back to Fontaine soon — no employer means no funding, after all. But, I wanted to finish my investigation first.
Allier: I'd like to ask some questions about Huitzilin. I want people outside of Natlan to hear her story, but my understanding still has some holes.
Citlali: Questions? Hmph... Why should I let an outlander tell our stories?
Allier: Don't misunderstand — I have no intention of twisting your history or using it to make a profit. It's just honest curiosity, I assure you.
Allier: I believe amazing stories deserve to be shared with the world. Culture thrives through dialogue and exchange.
Traveler: He has a point.
Citlali: Alright, you can ask your questions, but be quick. I have important plans after this.
Paimon: Important plans?
Allier: Thank you very much!
Black Screen Text: Allier conducts a thorough interview, only leaving when Citlali finally runs out of patience.
Citlali: Another day, another drained social battery...
Traveler: We should probably get going, then.
Citlali: Mhm... Ah, hold on — you owe me a pair of books!
Paimon: Oh, that... When it comes to light novels, your memory is like a steel trap, huh...
Traveler: Books that rare will take some time to find...
Citlali: You're telling me... Yeah, it's not gonna be easy — you might need to go to Yae Publishing House in person...
Citlali: But, I don't need them right away. Just don't forget, okay?
Paimon: Of course! We'll get them sent to you as soon as we can!
Citlali: Sent to me...? Nuh-uh, I don't want a stranger knocking on my door when I'm hungover. Here, just take this.
Paimon: And this is...?
Citlali: The key to my house. Don't bother knocking next time — you'll disturb my sleep.

### Additional Talk 1

Montluson: My bank balance...

### Additional Talk 2

Caholom: Ah, Natlan's victory against the Abyss! Very fitting for a scroll like this...
Aywastin: I wonder how long until Elder Tlapo chooses the next appointed?
Besuci: Speaking of Elder Tlapo, I heard he went missing yesterday! Do you know what happened?
Chogan: Elder Tlapo works in mysterious ways. The meaning of his departure will become clear in time, but for now, we cannot hope to fathom it.
