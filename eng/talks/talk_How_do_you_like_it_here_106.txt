Traveler: How do you like it here?
Dehya: Haha, beats living in the desert. No crazy temperatures, no howling gales, no sandstorms...
Dehya: Plus, you don't have to keep an eye out for monsters popping out of the ground or vultures swooping down from the sky.
Traveler: Is life in the desert that rough!?
Dehya: There's no getting around these things if you wanna survive out there.
Dehya: You also can't forget to keep your guard up in case of troublemakers...
Dehya: Whoa, what's with that look on your face? Scared stiff?
Dehya: Relax, you've got me. Just bring me along the next time you go to the desert, and I'll handle everything for ya.
