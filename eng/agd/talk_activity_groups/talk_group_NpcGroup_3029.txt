## Talk

Kuroda: Hello there. Welcome to Yae Publishing House, and welcome to the Magnificent Irodori Festival, run jointly by the Yae Publishing House and the Yashiro Commission.
Kuroda: It's just a shame that the writer of the prize-winning text "First Apprentice of Guhua" could not release a new volume in time for the festival. I doubt we'll be able to meet them this time...

Kuroda: Greetings! Welcome to Yae Publishing House.

## Talk

Traveler: I'm looking to buy some books.
Kuroda: Thank you for your patronage! Feel free to look around!

## Talk

Traveler: And you might be...?
Kuroda: My name is Kuroda... I'm actually the executive editor of Yae Publishing House. But the author I'm handling has yet to come up with any updates yet, so I'm pretty idle right now, so I figured, why not come down to the bookstore to help promote some books?
Kuroda: Have you found anything that strikes your fancy? Feel free to let me know.

## Talk

Traveler: I'd like to know about Yae Publishing House.
Kuroda: Yae Publishing House is founded by Lady Yae Miko, the Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine. We mainly sell Light Popular Novels, which are more commonly known as Light Novels.
Kuroda: As you can see, the first floor is the bookstore, where we sell the books that we have published.
Kuroda: You must be an outlander, right? In that case, I highly recommend our local light novels. These are the most popular with young people nowadays.
Kuroda: Even some outlander authors have started to follow the trend of writing light novels now. They've even submitted some drafts to us.
Kuroda: Many light novel fans from other islands have traveled all the way here to buy books. They even call it a pilgrimage... Haha, well, I guess light novels are just that popular, huh?

## Talk

Traveler: Thank you! I'll have a look myself.
Kuroda: Sure. Feel free!

## Talk

Traveler: Who's the author you're in charge of...?
Kuroda: Hmm? Oh yeah, that reminds me. The author that I handle is an outlander as well. Have you ever heard of Mister Chang from Liyue? He once won an award in the "This Novel Is Amazing!" contest. "The First Apprentice of Guhua" is one of his well-known works.
Kuroda: ...You say you've met this person in Liyue before? Could it be a coincidence... Anyway, I originally wanted him to come up with a cooler pseudonym, but he refused to do that and insisted on using his real name.
Kuroda: Still, it's thanks to him that I've got the reputation I have as an editor. I only wish that he can find his muse soon and come up with some new works.
Kuroda: *sigh* If it weren't for the Sakoku Decree, I would have gone to Liyue to push... Uh, I mean, to visit him.

Kuroda: Well, now that the Sakoku Decree is no more, I should be able to go to Liyue and personally chasâ€” I mean, pay him a visit!

Traveler: Adventure Challenge

## Talk

Kuroda: Wonderful! Ah, this may be a point of reference for the novel... I'll chronicle this game right now!

## Talk

Kuroda: For the work of editing King of Invokations, we must know the rules of Genius Invokation TCG by heart.

## Talk

Traveler: Duel

## Talk

Kuroda: How did this happen? Well... Fortunately, reality is not fiction, and losing a game doesn't have any real consequences...

## Talk

Kuroda: Well, I won because there was actually a duel just like this one in King of Invokations...
