# Scenes from Life in Meropide: Dead End


## Talk 1

Galvaryet: Hello, what is it?
Traveler: Please help us, good sorceress!
Galvaryet: Why are you talking like Lanoire? Just get to the point.
Paimon: We need lots of Coupons. Are there any jobs we can take?
Galvaryet: You didn't join Estienne's game, did you? You should know when to stop.
Galvaryet: ...Nonetheless, there is something that I need your help with.
Galvaryet: Clynes should be repairing his device or whatever it is by the Rift of Erosion. Go help him out, would you?
Galvaryet: Just ask him for compensation. He won't object.
Paimon: We'll take care of it!
Traveler: Is there anything we can help with?
Paimon: It would be better if there's compensation!

## Talk 2

Clynes: Just in time. Come help me out!
Traveler: You can read minds? That's scary!
Paimon: Galvaryet sent us to help you... But how did you know that?
Clynes: ...Because you're the only ones here to help.
Paimon: ...Well, that makes sense!
Clynes: Anyway, the task is nothing difficult. The Research Terminal here requires two people to operate it simultaneously, and I've already entered the commands. Just walk over and pull the lever.
Clynes: I almost forgot... The charging device should be nearby. Please install the charging device first before starting.
Clynes: And... Just to double-check, you're not machine killers, are you?
Traveler: It depends on how you define machine killers.
Paimon: Why do you ask?
Clynes: I asked Galvana for help last time, and even though I only looked away for a moment, when I looked back, the terminal was already destroyed. I asked her what happened, but she couldn't tell me.
Clynes: I found out from her sister later that no machines can survive under her for more than half a day. Even Alain Guillotin would have given up on her, I suspect.
Clynes: Even the repair fee was deducted from my compensation. If you're just like her, then all my hard work will be in vain.
Paimon: What a story. We're definitely not like her. Don't worry!
Clynes: I'm counting on you, then.
Traveler: If the research terminal attacks me, then I guess I am.
Traveler: We won't do this for free, though.
Clynes: I'll ask Galvaryet to apply for your payment later.
Paimon: Huh? She said we can get compensation from you directly.
Clynes: Did she? Alright, then. Applying for funds here is even harder than from the Fontaine Research Institute...

## Talk 3

Clynes: Is there something you don't understand? Just pull the lever along with me â€” very simple.

## Talk 4

Clynes: Looking good. If we weren't in a place like this, I would have hired you as my assistants.
Paimon: This is too easy. By the way, what does this device do?
Clynes: There was a rift that connected to the outside, and it had to be watched. Now we can just seal the passage with this device and save manpower.
Clynes: This is nothing new to the Fontaine Research Institute, anyway. But since I have plenty of time, I modified it a little.
Clynes: What you're seeing now isn't even its final form, which was actually deployed at the Geode Mine Shaft... Ahem, I think I spoke too much. Just pretend you didn't hear anything.
Traveler: So, there are exits in the Geode Mine Shaft.
Clynes: Right, you're a smart one. But if you were smarter, you would have kept that to yourself and not blurted it out.
Clynes: Anyway, problem solved. Galvana no longer needs to come down too often, and I can take a break.
Clynes: ...Ah, yes. I almost forgot about your compensation. Thanks for the help!
Traveler: Is the final version more powerful?
Clynes: Of course! There are other components... Wait, why do you want to know?
Clynes: If you want to know the full extent of it, you can give it a try yourself. But if you're caught, don't say I put you up to it.
