# Sharpshooter on Hand


## Talk 1

Zicheng: Hmm... To evoke poetry with painting, or to paint with poeticism...
Zicheng: Hmm... No, no, aren't these two phrases referring to the same thing...?
Traveler: What are you talking about?
Zicheng: Ah, hello. That's right. I'm attempting to write a poem about Natlan's scenery.
Zicheng: But... To be honest, the landscapes here are very different from those of Liyue. I'm not familiar with the local history, either, so I don't even know where to begin.
Zicheng: Besides, I'm no professional poet, no rhymer of repute... Indeed, I've never even lived it up with a limerick...
Zicheng: *sigh* But I can't simply go back empty-handed. My colleagues at the Ministry of Civil Affairs will tease me. "Were you seeking inspiration out there, or just respiration?"
Traveler: You work at the Ministry?
Zicheng: That I do... sort of. I was hired some time back to do some land surveys.
Zicheng: *sigh* In practice, I was taking people around Liyue to see if the water and soil have changed, or if the maps need to be updated, and such.
Zicheng: One round of that left me exhausted, and with goodness knows how many pairs of worn-out shoes... So I decided to take a vacation. Needed a change of pace, you know?
Zicheng: It's just that... I don't know what I was thinking, but when I applied for the time off, I gave my reason as: "Got the urge to write some poetry. Going to get some inspiration."
Zicheng: I didn't expect the person in charge of approving leaves of absence to respond so seriously, with a "May poetic puissance be yours"... and half a month's leave to go with it...
Traveler: Isn't that a good thing?
Zicheng: You'd think so, yes... Except that the entire Ministry now knows why I'm on vacation!
Zicheng: *sigh* It has been fun, of course. I'm not doubting that. The scenery's good, the food's pretty nice, and they've got all manner of interesting life here, especially the cute little baby Saurians...
Zicheng: But not a line of poetry has come to mind. Not one!
Zicheng: I even borrowed a Kamera to help me gather inspiration, but that hasn't done me much good.
Zicheng: I'm fine with natural scenery, but forget shops and crowds — I can't make out anything in those shots.
Traveler: Um, how about I help you?
Zicheng: Wait. You'd help me? Oh, thank goodness... I have to gather some inspiration no matter what.
Zicheng: Let me think...
Traveler: Oh, I'm great at taking photos.
Traveler: And have you proved a poet most puissant, perchance?
Zicheng: Not in the slightest, but the news of my vacation and its purpose have spread far and wide nonetheless. Now everyone in the Ministry knows what I've gone to Natlan for!
Traveler: Are you writing poetry?

## Talk 2

Zicheng: You're back! Have you finished taking the picture?
Traveler: That I have.
Zicheng: Wow, you're good. Much better than my assistant for sure. Whenever he takes pictures of the sites we're surveying, we're looking at several takes, minimum.
Zicheng: If we had you on the survey team, I bet we'd have ruined a few Kameras less.
Traveler: Can you really use this to help write poetry?
Zicheng: I... think so? Well, and if I can't make it work, I'll just use the picture as a postcard.
Zicheng: I'll write some wish-you-were-heres on the back and have it sent to the Ministry. No one'll say nothin', not after the gift!
Zicheng: *cough* That's the last resort, though. In the meantime, I'll give this "writing a good poem" business some thought...
Zicheng: The five winds... surge? ... No, roil, perhaps... Wait a moment. How many tribes does Natlan have anyway?

## Talk 3

Zicheng: I've heard that there's a beautiful stage over where the Children of Echoes are, at which people perform daily.
Zicheng: Please, help me take a picture of that grand stage at noon — better still if you could get a shot with those performing in it as well...

## Talk 4

Zicheng: Ah, yes! I've heard people say that the People of the Springs have very distinctive shop signage, and amongst them, I believe, is "Djembe Studios."
Zicheng: Please, help me take a picture of that studio in the early morning hours!

## Talk 5

Zicheng: The Courier's Longhouse over where the Scions of the Canopy dwell sees much hustle and bustle, and the signboard of that famous spot, too, is most distinctive.
Zicheng: Hehe, could I ask you to snap a shot of it at sunset, thereabouts?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Zicheng: Other than Djembe Studios, the People of the Springs play host to two other famous stores.
Zicheng: I'd love to compare their signboards, should they prove quite idiosyncratic as well.

### Additional Talk 2

Zicheng: Apart from the grand stage, word is that the Children of Echoes is also home to a large gemstone shop.
Zicheng: A picture of those gems would make for a fine memento, I'd say...

### Additional Talk 3

Zicheng: Hmm... There's a huge mural at the cliffs where the Scions of the Canopy live, isn't there?
Zicheng: Now, if you find that mural, help me take a picture of it, would you?

### Additional Talk 4

Zicheng: You're back! Have you finished taking the pictures?
Traveler: I took a few extra shots for good measure.
Zicheng: Wow, you're good. Much better than my assistant for sure. Whenever he takes pictures of the sites we're surveying, we're looking at several takes, minimum.
Zicheng: If we had you on the survey team, I bet we'd have ruined a few Kameras less.
Traveler: Can you really use these to help write poetry?
Zicheng: I... think so? Well, and if I can't make it work, I'll just use the pictures as postcards.
