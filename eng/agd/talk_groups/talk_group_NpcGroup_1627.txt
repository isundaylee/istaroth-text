Xu: I've heard that Master's taken on quite a fair bit of work this Lantern Rite. It should be going smoothly, of course.
Xu: Still, there's neither hide nor hair of him, as always...
Xu: Oh, my apologies. How may the Feiyun Commerce Guild be of assistance to you, good sirs?

Traveler: About the Kamera...
Xu: Have you managed to deliver the pictures?
Traveler: Done deal.
Xu: Thank you, thank you. I'm sorry for troubling you, but we're barely keeping our heads above the water here...
Xu: Ah, yes. Please take this Kamera as thanks for your help.
Traveler: I couldn't...
Xu: It's no problem. I mean, you did help us, didn't you?
Xu: This is not an exceedingly expensive object, either. It's just a sample that our partners in Fontaine gave us.
Xu: There are some differences between it and the official model... but the basic functions are all there. It'll definitely be enough for your needs.
Xu: And if you take a liking to it, you can also help us with some advertising here and there...
Xu: Ahem... Regardless, thanks for your help, and please, take this Kamera with you.
Traveler: This must be very expensive...

Traveler: About the Kamera...
Xu: I wonder how the folks in Fontaine managed to put this clever little thing together? It's so fascinating...

Traveler: Sirs...?
Xu: Yes, I'm referring to you. The vast majority of visitors here are in big business, so I've become accustomed to speaking politely.
Xu: What's more, the master here has made it clear, if you want to be in business, you be polite to everyone.
Xu: If you treat people by their appearances, one day you're going to offend someone very important.
Xu: Call it a business principle of the Feiyun Commerce Guild if you will.

Traveler: Master?
Xu: The master I just referred to?
Xu: A lot of our business is left up to him, including our most important silk trade.
Xu: As incredibly gifted as he may be in the art of business, his heart isn't in it. He has a habit of suddenly disappearing.
Xu: What's even more impressive is the fact that this hasn't affected business in the slightest. Conversely, business over the last few years has only become better and better.
Xu: Even if you do manage to catch him, there's nothing to really accost him for anyway so...
Xu: *sigh* I can't make sense of it...

Traveler: We need to get going.
Xu: Take care. If you have any more business to attend to, remember us here at Feiyun Commerce Guild, won't you?

## Talk 1

Xu: Ah, you're the Young Master's friends. How do you do?
Xu: Please accept my apologies, but I have something to ask of you. Is this a good time?
Traveler: Well, we're well-acquainted by now. Just speak your mind.
Xu: Well, here's the situation: there's this friend of mine named Muning who often helps us in business matters.
Xu: It's just that he wound up owing a small sum of Mora to the Yanshang Teahouse in recent days, leading to him asking our young master for help...
Xu: ...And the young master agreed without a second thought! Interest-free, if I might add. A most generous spirit... But best not one used while doing business, I fear.
Paimon: Oh, come on, he was just doing a guy some justice. Isn't that a good thing?
Xu: Yes, of course... But as you can see, Young Master Xingqiu has gone out to "right wrongs and enact justice," while I'm a little tied up with work back here. As such, the only person we can trust with the matter of delivering the Mora is you.
Xu: He should be working at The Chasm. He basically lives there, so I doubt you'll miss him.
Traveler: People actually still live at The Chasm?
Xu: Haha! Well, he is the specialist sent by the Ministry of Civil Affairs to the Chasm, after all!
Xu: Of course, that is a mine, so food, water, and daily necessities all need to be transported there from Liyue...
Xu: So there isn't much time for idling or for leisure, and life can be both tough and a little boring, but regardless, the remuneration is quite generous indeed.
Xu: Well... You are the great hero of Liyue. Perhaps it might still be a bit of a tall order to ask for huge favors, but I'm sure some people might be willing to make small exceptions for you, yes?
Xu: I believe that you'll be able to accomplish this task. If you do get stopped at the gates, though, come back here and we'll use some other methods instead.
Traveler: Well, I'll help for Xingqiu's sake.
Xu: Thank you so much!
Traveler: No concerns that I'll just pocket the sum?
Paimon: Hey! That's not something you say out loud!
Xu: Hahahaha! Come now, there's no need for such jokes. I trust you.
Traveler: Isn't The Chasm closed, though?
Traveler: Well, what's up?

## Talk 2

Xu: Why, this "Kamera" contraption captures quite the nice images, it seems...
Traveler: "Kamera"?
Xu: Yes... We recently imported a new product from Fontaine. It's supposed to be very popular over there at the moment.
Xu: It's a device that... Well, you press a button, and it makes an image on a piece of paper.
Xu: They're calling it a "Kamera"... I must say, I'm having quite a lot of fun with it. Have you heard of such a device?
Traveler: I think I may have.
Xu: Really? Haha, well, I suppose I should have expected you to be more knowledgeable than me, as a traveler.
Xu: Our young master has also taken a great liking to this Kamera. He's convinced that it will sell very well.
Xu: But given that this would be the first sale of this device, we don't have any guarantee that it'll be a success. As such, we've decided to run a trial event where citizens can come and have a free "photograph" taken first.
Xu: To our surprise, it was rather well-received. Quite a few people offered to pay a small fee for us to bring the Kamera to them and "take a picture"...
Xu: Some people also requested that we have the image framed and mounted and deliver it to them. But the number of people coming to us to have their pictures taken is now growing by the day.
Xu: I had intended to discuss the situation with the young master, but he's been gone for several days now.
Xu: In the meantime, we don't want to neglect our customers, so we've been doing our best to attend to everyone who comes to have their picture taken. But there are so many people now that we are struggling to keep on top of demand.
Xu: Traveler, could you do me a favor and deliver these two pictures to our customers?
Traveler: I've heard of similar products...

Traveler: I'll see it done.
Xu: You have my thanks, truly.
Xu: There should be names on the back of these... Agh, I must've forgotten to write them down in my hurry.
Xu: I'm sorry, but you'll have to try and find them based on the pictures. They're very clear, so you should be able to identify where you need to go at a glance.
Xu: Again, thank you. I apologize, but I must attend to other matters...
