Traveler: About Ogura Textiles & Kimonos...
Ogura Yuu: Ogura Textiles & Kimonos is a shop that my family has run proudly for many years. We only use the best quality materials and pay very close attention to the details. Many samurai lords used to come to the shop to purchase high-grade silk from Liyue.
Ogura Yuu: Have you ever been to Liyue? The Feiyun Commerce Guild there produces silk that is as smooth as flowing water. It's used to make top shelf clothing.
Ogura Yuu: I hear that it's because of a locally-grown red flower named Silk Flower that they can produce silk of such quality.
Ogura Yuu: If I get the chance, I'd love to bring my younger sister to Liyue and take a look at the Silk Flower fields...
