Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Roll up, roll up, this month's courier performance rankings are out! Star courier Adama, who's been busy preparing for the Pilgrimage, has fallen down to fifth place!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "The champion's position has been seized by none other than her teammate Zeila, who completed an astonishing 110 long-distance deliveries in just twenty days!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Could it be that Zeila has been treating delivering letters and packages as a form of training!? Unbelievable stuff... I'm starting to feel bad for the opponents she'll be facing in the upcoming Pilgrimage!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Ranked second to tenth, in the following order, we have: Tundama, Sausa, Sibu... All these couriers will receive a cash prize, plus a special "Yum Yum Yumkasaur" Chew Stick that Aclla made from the finest quality Cacahuatl!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Other fellow couriers, don't lose heart! Keep up the great work â€” maybe next month, the award will be yours!"
