## Talk

Keqing: #Hello, Traveler.
Keqing: Hmm... looks like you're pretty free today.

## Talk

Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Keqing: If you're asking from the perspective of comfort... I like it very much.
Keqing: But in my professional opinion... I think there's a lot of potential here that's not really being fully utilized.
Keqing: I mean, for starters, you don't even have to worry about mitigating natural disasters — or any other external risk factors for that matter. So that makes your land-use planning process a whole lot simpler.
Keqing: The main consideration for you is how to make the best use of the available space...
Keqing: Beyond that, you really want to think about the proportional allocation of resources...
Traveler: I think I got the general gist...
Keqing: Ah... don't mind me. I slipped back into work mode.
Keqing: Do whatever you like!
Keqing: It's your home, after all, you should be the one to shape it!
Traveler: Didn't understand a word...

## Talk

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Keqing: Sure, why not?
Keqing: Though I should warn you, most people aren't exactly enamored with my conversation.
Traveler: Oh, what do you mean?
Keqing: Well, for example, a colleague once asked me: "Is there anything I can help you with, Ms. Keqing?"
Keqing: To which I replied: "You can start by worrying about your own work rate."
Keqing: After that, they never approached me again.
Keqing: Another person asked me: "Do you have any gift suggestions for Lady Ningguang?"
Keqing: To which I replied: "Don't bother. Ningguang has no time for suck-ups."
Keqing: Yeah... Anyway, so now you know.
Traveler: Sounds like you're just a bit of a straight talker.
Keqing: Yeah... I just think if you've got something to say, there's no point mincing your words.
Keqing: Sugar-coating the facts, kind lies... it's all a big waste of everyone's time.
Traveler: Getting to the point is certainly... underrated.
Keqing: Exactly. See? You understand where I'm coming from.
Keqing: I was right all along, we've got a lot in common.
Traveler: Still, doesn't being so blunt all the time affect what other people think of you?
Keqing: I couldn't care less what those people think of me.
Keqing: But your opinion...
Keqing: ...Well, that might make me think twice.
Traveler: I don't think you did anything bad.

## Talk

Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Keqing: Sure, let's arrange an evening when both of us are free.
Keqing: A little while ago, I took some time to survey every inch of this place.
Keqing: I found three locations where the scenery was quite beautiful, it really resonated with me.
Keqing: One of them was perfect for stargazing.
Keqing: So, are you interested?
Traveler: Of course!
Keqing: Great.
Keqing: I was a little apprehensive actually, I was wondering how I could convince you if you refused at first...
Keqing: Personally, I consider it... a reward... for completing a stage of my work.
Keqing: Rare blessings like these... we mustn't let them go to waste.
Traveler: Keqing...
Keqing: Now that I know you don't have any reservations, you better go and work it into your schedule!
Keqing: The sooner the better, as far as I'm concerned.
Traveler: I never knew you had a stargazing hobby.
Keqing: It's not really a hobby...

## Talk

Traveler: Morning, Keqing.
Keqing: #Morning, Traveler.
Keqing: Ahem... Well, that's enough small talk for now. Call me if you need anything.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Keqing.
Keqing: #Night, Traveler.
Keqing: Wait! Remember... Don't put off until tomorrow what you haven't finished today.
Keqing: You can just hand it off to me instead.

## Talk

Keqing: As I thought, you've carefully observed the streets of Liyue.
Keqing: Your understanding of the layout of stores and vendors is most detailed.
Keqing: Would you be interested in discussing plans to improve Chihu Rock with me?

## Talk

Keqing: Getting a good rest is indeed key to being productive in one's work.
Keqing: This bedroom has everything, except for one item: it needs a clock to gauge time with.
Keqing: I'll find some time to accompany you to shop for a clock, lest you oversleep and miss something important.
