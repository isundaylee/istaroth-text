### Additional Talk 1

Anton: We'll leave soon. My apologies if we've disturbed your adventure.
Traveler: About the collaboration with the Millelith...
Anton: That was a long time ago. Shortly after this place was locked down, we contacted the Liyue Qixing.
Anton: At first, things went smoothly... Signora even nailed a few mutually beneficial trade agreements.
Anton: And one of the additional conditions was that Liyue would allow the Fatui to send an advance team into The Chasm... We came to investigate and eradicate the source of the anomalies.
Anton: As agreed, Snezhnaya and Liyue would share whatever we were to find down here.
Traveler: Don't you have other purposes?
Anton: At least none that I'm aware of. When we entered The Chasm, the local citizens even sent us their best wishes. We all thought... that we would be heroes, sacrificing ourselves for the sake of others.
Anton: *sigh*... Who'd have thought things would turn out like this?
Traveler: About the "Dark Calamity"...
Anton: "Dark Calamity," "the Calamity of Darkness," or whatever you call it... They all mean the great disaster that occurred five hundred years ago.
Anton: Anyway, it's the eternal enemy of Snezhnaya... For five hundred years, the calamity has been lurking in the dark and we'll be on guard forever.
Traveler: About you...
Anton: About us? There's nothing much to talk about... We fought hard and we failed. That's all.
Anton: When we first came down, we were the Ninth Company, a company of 64 soldiers. But now, I guess half of our men including our commander have either gone missing or died... Well, maybe not yet half of us...
Anton: But anyway, it's around that figure. We've been scattered and lost contact with each other... We lost this battle and should've retreated long ago.
Traveler: But your people on the ground attacked Liyue Harbor.
Anton: ...It's surprising but I think I can understand why.
Anton: To assist in endeavors of greater meaning, Lord Pulcinella won't hesitate to dispense with less valuable assets. That's his logic.
Anton: As his direct subordinate, I have no objections to his cause of action...
Traveler: About Katarina...
Anton: Did you meet her? Is she still alive? I hope she can forgive me.
Anton: Katarina and her younger brother, Corporal Nikolay, were brought up in the House of the Hearth. They are the children of Her Majesty the Tsaritsa.
Anton: She told me that she was going to find her brother. I thought she lost her mind having stayed in the environment down here... There's no way that her brother could live.
Traveler: So you abandoned her?
Anton: Abandon? No, she... she volunteered to stay. After all, unnecessary obsessions only slow the whole team down.
Anton: We... We're prepared to sacrifice our lives or the lives of our loved ones for all... This is the resolution of the Fatui.
Anton: Katya is no exception, nor is Kolya.
Anton: I wouldn't blame them if they did the same to me.
Traveler: The situation she's in is not so bad as you think.
Anton: You're an outsider. The Fatui can't and shouldn't get sentimental in front of civilians.
Anton: But to her, we're family. She's — she was — also our family.
Anton: But she insisted on looking for Kolya... I hope she can forgive me.

### Additional Talk 3

Radomir: Thank you for your food. If you have any questions, ask Staff Sergeant Anton. I have nothing to tell you.
Radomir: Um... Please don't misunderstand. I mean, when it comes to classified information, you know...
Radomir: Ahem, anyway... I hope we can meet again as friends.

### Additional Talk 4

Danila: Thank you for your help. Sorry that there's nothing I can give you in return.
Danila: This is the first time that Antoha has acted as our Company CO — Ha! Perhaps the last time too. But as long as he gets us out of here, I'll consider him to be a worthy CO.
Danila: Anyway, I wish you a successful journey.

### Additional Talk 5

Temur: Ha, look who's here? Our great benefactor! Next time we meet out in the wild, don't draw your sword too quickly, alright?
Temur: Hehe... I'm just kidding. I hope we won't be enemies next time we meet.
