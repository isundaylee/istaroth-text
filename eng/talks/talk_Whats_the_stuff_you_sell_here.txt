Traveler: What's the stuff you sell here?
Echuah: They are the fruits of adventure, trophies of the pioneering spirit.
Echuah: Some are trinkets I picked up myself, while others were given to me. As for what you buy â€” well, that's up to you!
Echuah: Of course, if you've got your eye on anything in particular, you can pay a deposit first, then take it over to the Saurian Relics Association for appraisal before you decide whether or not you want to buy it.
Echuah: But as for how professional their opinion would be... Haha, well, that's hard to say. If you ask me, you'd be better off listening to a few more of my stories.
