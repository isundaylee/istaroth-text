# Zero Hour Invokation

Frida: Hmm... Should I include this card? Huh? I still have some cards left...
Frida: Oh, hey Traveler! My apologies, I was too busy thinking about the card decks that I didn't notice you.
Frida: I'm an adventurer commissioned by the Guild to help organize the King of Invokations Grand Prix, and I'm in charge of a uh... duel event with special rules!
Frida: We named it "Zero Hour Invokation."
Traveler: How is this any different from ordinary TCG duels?
Frida: Oh, no, no, Zero Hour Invokation is an unofficial tournament with its own rules.
Frida: In Zero Hour Invokation, you will not be using your own decks. Instead, you'll be choosing three out of eight incomplete pre-built decks to form a full deck.
Frida: Within the three decks, you'll find some newly released cards. As for using them to their full potential... that'll depend on your card skills.
Frida: The rest of the rules are identical to ordinary matches.
Frida: If you're out of ideas on how you should build your deck, we're always here to help.
Frida: But I can't guarantee how good the decks will be, hehe.
Frida: Anyway, I suggest that you choose and build your own decks. You'll be using them to duel with other players after all.
Frida: If you're confident about your skills, you can head over to the other cities where the Grand Prix is being held and try out Zero Hour Invokation there.
Frida: Oh, and you don't have to stress over it. In Zero Hour Invokation, all participants will receive prizes, regardless of the outcome of their duels.
Frida: If you're interested, come try it out.
Traveler: Doesn't feel any different from the Grand Prix...
