Traveler: What are your thoughts about your work?
Mikoshi Genjirou: I believe that everyone should take their own job seriously. This is the only way to keep the whole system functioning properly.
Mikoshi Genjirou: Like those people from the army. They still haven't been able to defeat Sangonomiya after such a long time. A laughable lot!
Mikoshi Genjirou: From what I heard, the Sangonomiya troops have appointed some "dog" as their commander... If that's true, then that Kujou Sara really is good for nothing!
