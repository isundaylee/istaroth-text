Traveler: Maymunah seems troubled...
Maymunah: Yes, it is spacious here, but the number of stalls is limited. After the light in the large tent got fixed, even more people are interested in applying for a stall...
Maymunah: Nothing is harder than making decisions and arrangements!
Maymunah: My predecessor must have abandoned me here and fled back to Sumeru because they just couldn't take it anymore...
Maymunah: Still, anything is hard when you're first starting. If I just take time to think and train my brain... I'm taking care of these Fairgrounds in her stead to prove...
Maymunah: To prove that things would have been better, if only she had spent more time.
