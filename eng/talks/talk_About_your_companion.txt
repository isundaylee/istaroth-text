Traveler: About your companion...
Sumi: Though the resistance is definitely involved with the incident at the Mikage Furnace in some way, the Shogunate's policies are still way too harsh.
Sumi: I know the difficulties Vision-bearers face. I've taken some in before, after all.
Sumi: All in all, I don't particularly support either side, but I've chosen to stay here because of my companions.
