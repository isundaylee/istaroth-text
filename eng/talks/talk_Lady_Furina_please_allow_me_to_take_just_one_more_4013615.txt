# Talk Dialog

Xavier: Lady Furina, please allow me to take just one more photo of you! I would also love to get your autograph... just as a memento of our time together on the crew.
Furina: Hey, I've had enough of the Kamera flashes from when we were all up on stage.
Xavier: But... But Lady Furina, you are the best Director I've ever met! The most photogenic maiden in all of Fontaine! This kind of lively and celebratory setting is exactly where you shine. I believe all photographers would agree...
Xavier: Come, the brightest star of our land! Show us your light! The Kamera is waiting to sing praises of your beauty!
Furina: Well I'm flattered, but... but...
Furina: *sigh* Alright, I'll humor you and try a few more different poses.
Furina: But I don't have to hold the trophy, right?
Xavier: Ah... Ah! Of course! You may pose however you like!
Xavier: Thank you so much, thank you so much! By the heavens, my luck has been beyond belief, I'm having a hard time coming to terms with it now...
