# Yesterday's Tears, Tomorrow's Light


## Talk 1

Paimon: Oh, you found it! That's amazing!

## Talk 2

Navia: Let's go, you two! We've got to act fast. Ms. Coralie, please take Adele to the ship...
Florent: Watch out, Boss!
Colter: ...!
Florent: What do you think you're doing, Colter!?
Colter: Tch. I thought all the annoying little hindrances had left, but I still couldn't get rid of you.
Navia: You mean... This was all a trick so that you'd be left alone with me? Colter, are you with Romeuf too?
Navia: I get it now. You knew about their plans all along. You only told us they were doing badly so that we'd drop our guard...
Colter: Not quite. Though I share their positions on some issues, I've never cared for his more radical ideas.
Colter: And that's because... Out of the entire Spina di Rosula, I only hate you! Only you, Navia!
Florent: You'd better stay close to me.
Colter: Romeuf promised me that he would leave Poisson alone if I could just take you out.
Colter: But it was like you were glued at the hip to that pesky Traveler. You never gave me a chance to make my move...
Colter: Romeuf has lost his patience. I didn't have to be here today, you know, but I swore that I'd kill you, even if it meant being buried with you in the rubble.
Navia: Why?
Colter: Only someone as clueless about the past as you would ask such a foolish question.
Colter: You never saw the heyday of Spina di Rosula, nor did you ever live through the golden age of Poisson.
Colter: But I... I saw it all, with my own eyes! And then I had to watch it all die, little by little!
Colter: And it was all because of you, Navia.
Colter: Clementine died because of you, Callas died because of you, Melus and Silver died because of you... and so many more, dead! Everyone dead, all because of you!
Florent: So the shock and grief you showed us before... That was an act, too.
Colter: Now you're catching on! I heard Melus was dead the moment I got out.
Colter: Did you know? Down there in that blasted Fortress, I spent a long time thinking about what happened, and resolving to apologize to Melus as soon as I got out.
Colter: Back then, because of that aquabus, we had a huge fallout. I was convinced that all he cared about was loyalty, and that he had completely lost his capacity for critical thinking.
Colter: The years passed by in a blur after that. I thought I had finally begun to understand him, and that he could help me relive the good old days again...
Colter: But then, he died! And it was because of you again, Navia. It's always because of you!
Navia: ...
Colter: I once loved the Spina and Poisson more than anyone else! But what is left now of either besides death and ruin? You've singlehandedly destroyed everything that was beautiful, everything I've ever loved!
Florent: Don't listen to him, Boss. He's just spouting nonsense.
Colter: Have you ever considered that... Maybe the people around you don't actually care about you at all?
Colter: Have you ever considered that... Maybe you only get respect because you're Callas and Clementine's child? That you've never done anything worthy, that you're just a big nothing?
Colter: Have you ever considered that... Maybe people don't stay in Poisson because of you, but only because they have such beautiful memories of the past, before you came!
Navia: (Because if you do falter, there will inevitably come a time when you'll have to face the consequences. And when that time comes, those most precious to you really will throw themselves in front of you, and pay the price for your mistakes...)
Navia: (Yeah... looking back on it now as an adult, I can hardly believe how patient and kind everyone was.)
Navia: (But is that really why they support me? Is their kindness... real?)
Adele: Shut your mouth! I, for one, really like Miss Navia! And my mom loves her, too!
Navia: !!!
Adele: I don't know how to explain it, but I like her, and that's that!
Florent: I'm sure Mr. Melus would be extremely disappointed in you right now.
Florent: You've somehow managed to pin the blame for every mistake and tragedy in our history on the Boss herself.
Colter: Get out of the way, Florent. I don't want to hurt you.
Florent: You're gonna have to.
Florent: Boss, there's no time for this! Stop hesitating and get out of here before you get buried!
Navia: Maybe you think you're being the realist by painting the history of the Spina and Poisson like this.
Navia: But the love that I've felt from everyone was just as real. I've felt it. They've helped me get to where I am.
Navia: And even now, I will continue to believe in that love. So let me show you just how much I love the Spina di Rosula!

## Talk 3

Navia: Florent, I'll leave the town to you. Summon the other members and help with the evacuation of the townspeople.
Navia: If you find any of Colter's accomplices, subdue them quickly, and don't give them the chance to harm any ordinary civilians.
Navia: I can't allow my partner to face the danger on the Clementine Line alone.
Florent: Got it, Boss. I'm on it.
Florent: ...Are you okay, Navia?
Navia: I don't know, but I have to go.
Black Screen Text: A short while earlier, you and Paimon dashed to the entrance of Poisson.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Let's hurry up there! We have to protect the Clementine Line.
Paimon: If they're gonna blow up the waterway, they must have planted the explosives next to the support pillars!

## Talk 5

Paimon: These must be the explosives, right? And this is the control mechanism... Uh, how can we disable it?
Paimon: Paimon's too scared to touch any of this stuff...
Traveler: What's this?
Paimon: Huh? There's a strangely shaped hole here. What is it for?
Traveler: Could it be some kind of keyhole?
Paimon: That certainly sounds possible... Maybe one of the people we just beat up has the key?
Paimon: Okay, you take this side, Paimon will take the other, let's see what we can find!
Traveler: Or maybe an emergency switch?

## Talk 6

Paimon: That should do it, right?
Paimon: Phew... Navia and Florent should be able to relax now.
Traveler: We should still check out the perimeter, just in case.
Paimon: You're right, they could have set explosives elsewhere, too... Let's go!

## Talk 7

Black Screen Text: Having been alerted, members of the Maison Gardiennage arrive at the scene a short time later, and take Romeuf and all of his followers into custody.
Esmond: I heard from Thierry that even they're your enemies now, they were once a part of Spina di Rosula. Do you plan to settle this privately with them?
Navia: I have nothing more to say to them.
Navia: Regardless of whether their hatred and anger towards me or the Spina was justified, anyone who's willing to endanger innocent civilians is no longer sane enough to even be worth trying to talk to.
Navia: Please prosecute them in accordance to the law. Spina di Rosula will not raise any objections.
Esmond: Sounds good. We're very appreciative of your help. Without it, the consequences would have been far worse.
Esmond: Alright, this operation is a wrap. Take 'em away!
Paimon: We won, Navia! We saved everyone! And you were so cool!
Navia: Yeah... Luckily, we were just in time...
Traveler: You look a little pale...
Navia: Haha, it's probably because I expended too much elemental energy at once. Haha... I'll be fine. Don't worry about me.
Paimon: Aw, but you usually glow up whenever other people compliment you. Paimon's not used to seeing you like this.
Florent: Boss, we managed to catch all the infiltrators in the town. The Maison Gardiennage is taking them away as well.
Florent: Seems like Romeuf really went all in on this mission. If he sent literally everyone he had, though, that also means we've caught them all, too. We won't have to worry about them from now on.
Navia: Got it. That's good, at least.
Colter: ...
Navia: Colter.
Navia: I can understand how you feel. The things that we lost... they're forever beyond our grasp now, and that makes them appear even more precious.
Navia: I am not Callas, and I will also never become him. The Spina and the Poisson that you loved are both gone.
Navia: But I will not change how I feel about our future. I still believe that this is a great opportunity to start anew.
Navia: I will spend more of what the Spina earns on the betterment of Poisson. What's more, I'd also like to propose some changes to the aquabus routes...
Navia: So that one day, the people of Poisson will enjoy the boons it brings as well.
Colter: I know what you're trying to say. Mr. Callas... would never have said anything like that.
Colter: There are too many things in life that are just beyond our control. In that, we are the same.
Navia: Henceforth, you are no longer a member of Spina di Rosula.
Navia: But once you're discharged from the Fortress again, you're welcome to pay another visit to Poisson.
Colter: Thank you, Navia.
Florent: As I thought... Boss really is a kind and gentle person.
Navia: ...She is also, I must say, a truly unlucky person.
Navia: Thank you for protecting the Clementine Line.
Navia: #{NICKNAME}, I was actually really scared, you know. I mean, even the Callas Line won't be getting rebuilt anytime soon...
Navia: If I'd lost the Clementine Line too, I wouldn't know how to live with myself.
Navia: A name is a way to etch a memory onto the world. Losing the line that bears her name, that I can see every day, would be like losing my mother all over again.
Navia: Seeing it still standing there, tall and proud... It makes me really happy.
Paimon: What happened while we were gone? Honestly, you look more upset than tired or anything...
Florent: Just give her some time.
Traveler: It's okay, everything's fine now.
Navia: Mhm, thank you so much. Can you give me a hand? I really don't have much strength left.
Navia: #{NICKNAME}... I want to ask you something. And please, tell me the truth.
Navia: Do you really see me as your "partner"?
Traveler: Of course.
Navia: That's good then.
Navia: Hearing that... It brings me more relief than I can say.
Traveler: I'll get you back to Poisson.
Traveler: Feeling a bit fatigued?

## Talk 8

Paimon: How do you feel, Navia? Any better after taking a break?
Navia: Mhm, I feel quite a bit better, but I should probably still rest for a few more days.
Navia: Sorry, partner, I said some weird things earlier. Feel free to just ignore me.
Traveler: A little weird, that's true.
Navia: I used to think I'd never doubt myself, but you could say I've discovered that I'm not as strong as I thought I was.
Navia: Colter mentioned my parents, as well as Melus and Silver. It's all thanks to them that I've made it this far in life.
Navia: Do you think... they ever regretted the choices they made? Has my existence... made this world a better place?
Paimon: Don't think like that, Navia, you've already done more than enough.
Paimon: No matter what others think, we'll always support you to the end of the world!
Florent: Well, since it's ended up like this, I suppose it's time for me to make a confession as well.
Florent: There's something that I've been keeping from you as well, Boss. Please follow me... Everything's already prepared.
Navia: Hey, Florent, I hope you can understand that I can't deal with any more "shocking revelations" right now.
Florent: Don't worry, this surprise will be a pleasant one.
Traveler: But that's because I've never heard you doubt yourself before.
