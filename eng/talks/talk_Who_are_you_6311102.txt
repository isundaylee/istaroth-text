Traveler: Who are you?
Kujou Masahito: I am Kujou Masahito, a Shogunate officer. I've been stationed in Kannazuka with orders to command the troops here.
Kujou Masahito: Yes, it's the same Kujou that you are thinking of. The head of the Kujou Clan is my father. If you've ever heard of our clan before, then you should know what it means for me to be here.
Kujou Masahito: Ever since the war with the Sangonomiya resistance began, this place has been rocked by turmoil. It's not a suitable place for travel or adventuring.
