# Hyakunin Ikki: Narukami Arena


## Talk 1

Kayabuki Ikkei: Hello there, warrior from a foreign land!
Traveler: We meet again.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Indeed we meet again! You cut as dazzling a figure as ever...
Kayabuki Ikkei: ...Ahem, point is, it would seem that some people have been secretly organizing another Hyakunin Ikki.
Traveler: What is this Hyakunin Ikki again?
Kayabuki Ikkei: Hyakunin Ikki was originally a festival organized by the Tengu-kin to celebrate memorable events or make peace with loss through a good old-fashioned brawl.
Kayabuki Ikkei: During the festival, be it warriors or monsters, everyone can cast aside their preconceived notions with no questions asked about their origins in a pure, hot-blooded free-for-all.
Kayabuki Ikkei: They say that warriors who emerge from the festival victorious can also win all kinds of treasures...
Kayabuki Ikkei: ...That said, since the crack-down on the Tengu-kin, I'm not too sure who's organizing the festival this time or where the rewards will come from.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Anyway, it's too crowded here to be discussing this sort of thing. As always, please come with me...
Black Screen Text: Kayabuki Ikkei takes you to a small island outside Inazuma City...
Traveler: ...There's another one?
Kayabuki Ikkei: That's right. Perhaps your valor in battle has attracted even more people. To be honest, the audience got so fired up that they looked like they wanted to get in the ring themselves.
Kayabuki Ikkei: To be honest, I never thought the next Hyakunin Ikki would be so soon either...
Traveler: You are...?
Kayabuki Ikkei: Huh? You don't remember me? Ah, sorry, perhaps I was so busy recording your heroics in battle during the last Hyakunin Ikki that I didn't cheer loudly enough...

## Talk 2

Kayabuki Ikkei: Here we are. This is the place.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Same rules as always: Once you enter this rather suspicious-seeming door, you'll be in the tournament venue for this round of Hyakunin Ikki.
Traveler: ...It's looking as suspicious as always.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Anyway, I'll be recording your heroics and cheering for you at the top of my lungs this time, too.
Traveler: Great. I'm getting fired up already.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Well, I hope I'll get to see your flashy swordplay this time as well!
Traveler: This is always such a pain...
Traveler: What are the rules of Hyakunin Ikki?
Kayabuki Ikkei: The rules probably have not changed much. Monsters, adventurers, and warriors from across Teyvat, who share a common yearning for battle, will quench their thirst on this festival stage through passionate combat.
Kayabuki Ikkei: And of course, just like last time, feel free to bring your friends and companions! After all, the "Hyakunin" in "Hyakunin Ikki" means that the more people you bring, the merrier!
