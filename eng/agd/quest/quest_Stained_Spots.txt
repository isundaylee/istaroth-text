# Stained Spots


## Talk 1

Paimon: Chiori! We're here!
Chiori: Oh, you're here early. I haven't even opened the shop yet.
Paimon: Wait, has Kirara left already?
Chiori: Yep. With the Special Patrol, bright and early.
Paimon: Did everything go alright on the road?
Chiori: I believe so. The Patrol makes for quite the entourage.
Chiori: The way they marched forward with Kirara in the center, you'd think she was some sort of VIP. For the second leg, the Spina also came with a pretty large group, led by Navia herself.
Chiori: They took care to clear the path beforehand as well. Kirara won't so much as step on a single stray rock on her journey.
Chiori: I even heard that Navia decided out of the blue to make a batch of macarons as a going-away gift for Kirara. An excellent souvenir to remember Fontaine by, I'd say.
Paimon: Sounds like Navia really got into it!
Chiori: My thoughts exactly. She even lamented the fact that she didn't have time to prepare something even fancier. I'm pretty sure she can't wait for another escort opportunity to come her way.
Paimon: Y'know, now that you mention Navia, Paimon thinks the two of you are actually pretty similar... You say what you mean, and when you have an idea, you really hit the ground running...
Chiori: I suppose that's why we're such good friends.
Chiori: Navia has a certain resilience about her — it's part of who she is. No matter what comes her way, she never bows down in the face of adversity. That sort of determination and courage is something I really admire.
Chiori: That same spirit is the true vision of my brand. When she first mentioned commissioning an outfit from my boutique... Well, I'm sure you can imagine my excitement.
Paimon: It's like finding the perfect brand ambassador, huh?
Chiori: Indeed. Customers pay attention not just to the clothes, but also to the figures in society who wear said clothes. People like to copy the styles of those they look up to.
Paimon: Huh, and here Paimon thought all that mattered was for the clothes to look cute...
Chiori: Fashion is about more than just looks, my dear — especially if you've got your sights set on a market the size of Teyvat.
Chiori: ...Hmm? Well, would you look at the time...
Paimon: Oh yeah! Come on, let's get down to business. We're here to model!
Chiori: Indeed. Give me a moment while I go retrieve some fabrics and sample outfits. Why don't you help me set up the shop displays in the meantime?
Paimon: Set them up... Uh, how exactly?
Chiori: Just carefully organize the ready-to-wear clothes with an eye toward their types and styles. This way, we can guarantee that the customers will see something different every day.
Paimon: Whoa... There sure is a lot that goes into running a store!
Chiori: Well then, I'll leave the displays to you.

## Talk 2

Eloffe: Miss Chiori isn't the sort to just give up. She probably just needs a place where she can think in peace.

## Talk 3

Paimon: By the way, we really are just going to "talk," right?
Chiori: Of course. I wouldn't do anything to one of my business partners, especially when a reasonable conversation should suffice.

## Talk 4

Person Idly Chatting by the Roadside: If you ask me, I think Chioriya Boutique is done for.
Person Idly Chatting by the Roadside: I mean, what did they expect? Engaging with criminals behind their customers' backs...

## Talk 5

Paimon: Chioriii! Why did you just jump into the sea all of a sudden?
Chiori: Paimon, what do you think is the most beautiful thing in the sea?
Paimon: Huh? Erm... A Lumitoile? Or a pearl maybe... Ooh, coral's pretty too...
Paimon: Ah! Paimon gets it now... You want to use things like that as the "accessories" for your designs!
Chiori: Well, now that you've hit the nail on the head, help me grab some, would you?
Paimon: Leave it to us!

## Talk 6

Chiori: Just this once, though, I think I can make an exception. Go ahead and tear them up. Think of it as a good way to vent your emotions.

## Talk 7

Person Idly Chatting by the Roadside: They kept up a solid front, though. I've even bought from them before...
Person Idly Chatting by the Roadside: Really? How was it?
Person Idly Chatting by the Roadside: The owner was plenty fierce, that's for sure. Makes sense if she regularly deals with criminals, I guess. I've got the chills just thinking about it...

## Talk 8

Paimon: There you are, Chiori!
Chiori: Huh? How did you know where I... Ah, Eloffe told you, didn't she?
Paimon: She did... We were just looking for you at your shop, and Laetitia was there! She wanted to thank you for the dress... So you see? You don't have to be sad! We'll figure out how to get through this together!
Chiori: Ah, I'm not upset. I just wanted to get some fresh air.
Chiori: Want to sit here with me? The view's quite stunning.
Traveler: It's pretty high up...
Chiori: Don't worry, I'll catch you if you fall.
Paimon: Alright. Don't mind if we do!
Chiori: Well, how does it feel?
Paimon: This place is pretty great!
Chiori: Right? It's quiet and open, and far from the relentless critique from fashion commentators and the media. It's just you and the beautiful scenery.
Paimon: Yeah! It's important to take yourself out of that kind of stressful environment every once in a while.
Chiori: ...
Chiori: I didn't grow up in a very strict family. My parents would joke that I grew up to be so assertive because they spoiled me as a child.
Chiori: I would get together with the other children to climb trees and explore caves... One time, I even climbed over the walls of the Kamisato Estate. One of the servants had to physically remove me...
Paimon: Whoa... Paimon would have never imagined that...
Chiori: But even as rambunctious as I was, when it came to needlework, I was as quiet and focused as could be.
Chiori: It was as if I'd discovered a whole new world within those vibrant, dazzling fabrics... You know the feeling?
Paimon: Err, sorta...
Chiori: My parents noticed, and they sent me to study under a famous Inazuman tailor. It wasn't long before I had driven away pretty much every master tailor on the archipelago. You could say I really tried their patience.
Paimon: You were that misbehaved?
Chiori: I wasn't misbehaved, exactly. I just... often had strange ideas when it came to fashion, ones that weren't in line with traditional ways of doing things.
Chiori: On top of that, I hated the idea of groveling and making outfits for every arrogant big shot expecting me to be at their beck and call.
Chiori: Anyway, a few incidents later, I soon found myself without a master. Worse, not one shop was willing to hire me, not even to do grunt work.
Paimon: No wonder you left Inazuma...
Chiori: I was angry and frustrated, so before I left, I swore to all those "masters" that my brand would one day become renowned all over Teyvat.
Paimon: Well, that's a great dream to strive towards!
Chiori: After that, I came all the way to the Court of Fontaine — a city often referred to as the capital of arts and fashion.
Chiori: I had a lot of fun starting out. Sure, I was living in a small, cramped room... but I was finally free to make whatever I wanted.
Chiori: I had a far more naive view of "fashion" back then. As long as something was pretty, it would become popular, right? A simple concept, surely.
Chiori: Of course, as I spent more and more time in the industry, I learned nothing was ever that simple, least of all "fashion."
Traveler: Well, I know someone who absolutely adored your designs...
Chiori: Oh, you mean Laetitia?
Chiori: Yeah, she did mention that dream... I'll be honest with you. That's the first time I ever heard something like that from one of my customers.
Chiori: Who would have thought... Even as I continue to pursue my dream, my work has also become someone else's...
Chiori: ...
Chiori: Alright, that's enough sight-seeing for one day. Time to come up with a way out of this mess.
Paimon: Ooh! Looks like you've got your game face back!
Chiori: Back? It was never gone to begin with. I did say I wasn't upset, didn't I?
Paimon: Paimon thinks we should look for evidence that Uther wrote that article, and that he hired those Treasure Hoarders to attack Kirara!
Paimon: Charlotte's already working on an article to address all those nasty rumors, so we can publish all our findings in The Steambird once we're done!
Chiori: I don't like duking it out in the press... But if Charlotte's thrown her hat in the ring, I won't stop her, either.
Chiori: I know where Uther's clothing factory is located. It might be a good place to start looking for some evidence.
Paimon: Sounds good! We'll come with!
Paimon: As for Fashion Week... Well, there's always next year, right? So there's no need to be too upset!
Chiori: Hmm? When did this become an either-or situation? Find incriminating evidence, or participate in Fashion Week? Hah, I'm doing both.
Paimon: Huh? But your accessories... Didn't you say your designs were unusable without them?
Chiori: Well, it's true that I haven't quite figured out what to do about that, but...
Chiori: To tell you the truth... Even here in Fontaine, every time I see the sea, I can't help but remember Inazuma... and the vow I made in front of those "masters"...
Chiori: Thinking about all that, I just... can't bear to take even one step back.
Paimon: ...
Chiori: ...The sea...
Paimon: Hmm? What did you just say, Chiori?
Chiori: ...The sea. Seashells... Coral...
Chiori: ...I've got it!
Paimon: Huh? Got what?
Chiori: Come! Let's take a dip, shall we?
Paimon: Huh!? Chiori, wait, hold up!
Traveler: And dreamed of wearing one at her wedding...
Traveler: It doesn't look like there's a lot of space...
Chiori: Ah, sorry about that. I'm the only one here most of the time.

## Talk 9

Chiori: Please organize the clothes with an eye towards their types and styles. I'm counting on you.

## Talk 10

Chiori: Hmm, not bad. You might just have an eye for design.

## Talk 11

Chiori: ...You didn't get bought out by my competitors, did you? This arrangement... It's...
Chiori: ...Never mind. It might look like a chaotic mess, but I suppose it works as a change of pace — and who knows? This style arrangement might come into vogue someday.

## Talk 12

Chiori: Okay, we've got the materials for the accessories. Next... we'll need to use what we have on hand to create some new outfits.
Paimon: You mean we have to start from scratch? Will there be enough time?
Chiori: I should be able to make it... if I skip out on sleep.
Paimon: Nuh-uh, skipping out on sleep is not the answer! Wait... How come this conversation is giving Paimon major deja vu...
Traveler: Sounds pretty similar to one we've had with Ganyu before.
Chiori: Ganyu? Who's that?
Paimon: A friend of ours who does way too much overtime!
Paimon: Well, anyway... Sleep is important! You're not gonna convince Paimon otherwise!
Chiori: Haha, well I can't argue with you there. One thing's for sure, though — I'm going to do whatever it takes to make it work.
Chiori: Hah... All this grit and determination... It reminds me of the first Fashion Week I ever participated in...
Paimon: What else can we help with?
Chiori: Hmm... Let me see...
Chiori: I suppose all there's left to do is... tear up all the outfits currently on display.
Paimon: You got it! Uh... Wait, what did you just say!?
Chiori: You heard me. Tear them all up.
Chiori: When I went to that first Fashion Week, I had no savings to speak of, just a few dozen yards of fabric and a dream.
Chiori: I had to make something work, so I tore up all the clothes that I brought with me from Inazuma, and I used the scraps to make my entries for the show. I used the larger pieces for the base fabric and the smaller pieces for accessories...
Chiori: If it worked back then, why not now? We can also repurpose some of the ready-to-use accessories in the shop as well.
Paimon: But... You worked so hard on all these outfits...
Chiori: I know. That's why I refuse to let it all go to waste. I'm not going to let them win, even if it takes everything I've ever made and more.
Paimon: Um, okay... Then, here goes nothing...
Chiori: No need to be nervous. I won't hold it against you.
Chiori: Of course, if anyone dared to tear up one of my dresses in front of me on a normal day, I'd probably toss them into the sewer.
Traveler: I guess going after what you want means making certain sacrifices.

## Talk 13

Eloffe: I know Miss Chiori has put a lot of work into making Fashion Week a success...
Eloffe: I hope you can talk things through with the supplier.

## Talk 14

Paimon: Lyney, Lynette! Great, you're both here!
Lynette: A moment later and you'd have missed us.
Lyney: We read the article in the papers — we were just about to go find Miss Chiori.
Lyney: She helped design a number of our costumes in the past and even sponsored one of our performances. The time has come, it seems, for us to return the favor.
Paimon: Ooh, perfect! She was the one who sent us!
Lyney: In that case, I assume that there's something we can do to help? Just say the word, and we'll take care of it.
Paimon: Okay, so it's like this...
Lyney: ...Is that all we'll need to do?
Lynette: Should be a piece of cake for the two of us.
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon's glad to hear it!
Paimon: Well then... Guess it's about time we go and find some evidence for all the bad stuff Uther has been doing, right?
Paimon: Chiori said we shouldn't disturb her over the next couple of days. We can check in with her again once she's done with all the new designs.
Lyney: But the show's in another two days, isn't it? Will she be able to make the deadline?
Paimon: Well, according to her, she wants to first beat Uther fair and square at the show, and then defeat him in the court of public opinion. She said that it'd be like, uh...
Lyney: A two-pronged approach?
Lynette: Courtesy first, confrontation second?
Paimon: Uhh... Yeah, something like that.
Lyney: Understood. Then we'll have faith in her decision. We'll go make some preparations — see you at the venue in two days.
Paimon: Alright! We're counting on you!
Paimon: Okay, then let's also do as Chiori said and meet up with her at Uther's factory in two days. We'll gather the evidence then.
Paimon: Paimon sure hopes she won't have a hard time making all of those new outfits for the show...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Chiori: Speaking of clothes... Do yours happen to need any mending right now, Kirara?
Kirara: Ehehehe... Well since you asked, Chiori, there's this part around my waist...
Chiori: Oh? Need a bit of letting out around the middle?
Kirara: No! It's a tear! Those bad guys did it!

### Additional Talk 2

Charlotte: So, in your opinion, what is Miss Chiori like as a person?
Laetitia: Let's see... Well, she's certainly not afraid to say what she means, but she always looks out for her customers however she can...

### Additional Talk 3

Paimon: These should be enough, right? Paimon picked all the prettiest ones in this area!
Paimon: Chiori! Will these do?
Chiori: Hmm... everything looks great. I've also collected a pretty big batch, so we should have enough.
Paimon: Great! So, are we gonna head back now and make some new designs?
Chiori: Yes, but don't forget, we've got more than just the designs to worry about when we get back.

### Additional Talk 4

Navia: What should we do about these clothes everywhere? Need any help?
Chiori: Sort them by the type of fabric first, and then by color. Oh and, don't forget to remove any accessories and put them to the side.
Charlotte: That sounds pretty straightforward. I'll help, too!

### Additional Talk 5

Person Idly Chatting by the Roadside: If you ask me, I think Chioriya Boutique is done for.

Fashion Week Promotional Poster: Let the light of fashion shine upon the City of the Arts!

### Additional Talk 8

Graciette: Fashion Week is coming up! My husband promised to get me a replica of the most eye-catching outfit from the show.
Trudaine: Oh, I say! As expected of a high-flying merchant! How generous of him!
Trudaine: Well, what a coincidence, though — my husband promised me precisely the same thing!
Graciette: Oh dear! Whatever are we going to do, then, if we fall in love with the same dress?
Trudaine: Well, let's leave our gentlemen to figure that one out for themselves, shall we?

### Additional Talk 9

Graciette: Did you read the paper today?
Trudaine: Oh I did! My goodness, I couldn't believe what I was reading!
Graciette: Do you think there's any truth to it? Have you asked your husband? He's a judge isn't he?
Trudaine: Pfft, he would never indulge in such idle gossip! Still, he advised me to hold off on buying any more related wares for the time being.
Graciette: Yes, how prudent — wait for the dust to settle. My husband said the same.
Trudaine: Indeed, indeed! I wouldn't want to invite scandal through one of my purchases, now would I?
