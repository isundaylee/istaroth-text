Yoimiya: Want to get some shut-eye and rest for a bit? I'll keep you company!
Yoimiya: Or... If you're not sleepy, how about we chat for a bit? Maybe I could tell you a story!
Yoimiya: Oh, sorry! Am I talking too much? Hehe, I just get so excited when I'm in a new place â€” I wanna see everything there is to see. I've always got the energy to explore!

## Talk 1

Yoimiya: There are so many enemies here! If all of them were written into a youkai story, it'd be dark long before you finished just reading the names out!
Yoimiya: But fear not! The Invincible Yoimiya is here to save you from the clutches of the evil youkai!
Yoimiya: ...Haha, okay, that was a little embarrassing... But I sounded pretty cool, right?

## Talk 2

Yoimiya: You sure don't need to worry about me getting bored here. I'm spoiled for choice with all these books! I hardly know where to start!
Yoimiya: I want to memorize all the interesting parts, so I can go back and tell them to my friends!
Yoimiya: Oh, right, that's another thing I meant to ask! Which of these books do you recommend? I want to know what kind of stories you're into!
