# The Blazing Stars Ring in Fortune


## Talk 1

Pengyi: Oh, it's you! Thanks so much for your help previously.
Pengyi: Are you here to try your hand at making some fireworks?
Traveler: What sorts of fireworks can I make?
Pengyi: Oh, lots and lots! I could be here all day and not finish talking about them. That said, I've written some basic formulas down for you.
Pengyi: Go ahead, have a gander at them!
Pengyi: I have faith that you'll be able to make some lovely fireworks!
Traveler: See you.
Pengyi: Ah, you must be busy with other things, I suppose? In that case, pop by again when you're free — but don't go through this Lantern Rite without making a few fireworks, you hear?

## Talk 2

Ningguang: ...Send this report to the Ministry of Civil Affairs and have them delegate each of the tasks on the list to the appropriate departments.
Ningguang: Also, be sure to tell them that though the Lantern Rite may be complicated, everything must be done properly.
Paimon: Hello, Lady Ningguang! It's us again!
Traveler: We're not disturbing you, are we?
Ningguang: No, of course not. You are my honored guests.
Ningguang: And given the looks of you two, I presume that you are here to celebrate the Lantern Rite?
Paimon: That's right! So what's on the agenda for the festival this year?
Ningguang: As always, there will be a variety of activities taking place. Oh, but there is one of particular interest... The Ministry of Civil Affairs is planning a fireworks show this year. It should certainly be worth your time.
Ningguang: Releasing Mingxiao Lanterns has always been at the heart of the Lantern Rite, but with all that has occurred in Liyue as of late, I think the people of the city need something to warm their hearts, a feeling of everyone coming together in solidarity.
Ningguang: So, I believe that this year calls for a celebration of particular magnificence, something that would be closer to the hearts of every citizen.
Ningguang: We are currently in the process of placing fireworks at various locations all throughout Liyue. We shall choose a timely moment during the festival to set off all the fireworks in unison, allowing the sparkling lights and excitement to resonate with the hearts of the people.
Paimon: Fireworks? But we've already seen fireworks in other places before.
Paimon: Is there something special about the fireworks in Liyue?
Ningguang: Fireworks were originally developed alongside many other inventions here in Liyue.
Ningguang: When our ancestors first created fireworks, they were originally known as "firecrackers." Their bright flashes and loud sounds were often used for warding off beasts or as warning signals to other people.
Ningguang: In those days, it was difficult for people to contact one another while out farming the land, so they would carry firecrackers with them to give signals when necessary.
Ningguang: But people's lifestyles began to change after Liyue Harbor was founded. They no longer had to travel out of town to tend the fields anymore, so the use of firecrackers for emergencies also began to dwindle.
Ningguang: But through our local customs, the pioneering spirit of the firecrackers has been passed down to this very day.
Ningguang: We made improvements to firecrackers and began setting them off during the Lantern Rite to commemorate the tenacious spirit of our ancestors.
Traveler: Classic Liyue...
Paimon: Wow, everything has so much history in Liyue.
Ningguang: As I am sure you already know, everything on this land accumulates history and value as time passes. That is the nature of Liyue.
Ningguang: I've left Keqing in charge of the fireworks show. If you're interested, why don't we pay her a visit together?

## Talk 3

Keqing: Hmm, we need to add a few more locations for launching fireworks. The show has to be visible all across Liyue, not just in the city. They celebrate Lantern Rite in Qingce Village too, you know.
Pengyi: B—But Lady Keqing, what about our budget...
Keqing: The budget is exactly what it's meant to be. It's the necessary amount of funds to properly carry out a task.
Keqing: If you think the current budget will not suffice, then we'll simply have to apply for more funding from the Ministry of Civil Affairs and wait for their approval.
Keqing: Our aim is to organize a memorable Lantern Rite. The budget is there just to facilitate planning, we mustn't lose sight of our goal.
Pengyi: Yes, Lady Keqing. I understand.
Keqing: Good, and please remember, safety first.
Keqing: Oh, it's Ningguang and the Traveler! Good to see you.
Keqing: Are you here for the Lantern Rite? Your timing couldn't be any better, the preparations are almost complete.
Traveler: What are you working on, Keqing?
Keqing: I'm reviewing the positioning of the fireworks and double-checking the relevant facilities... It's all in a day's work.
Ningguang: Forgive my directness, but if I'm not mistaken, you could just as easily leave these tasks to your subordinates. You've already been working around the clock these past few days, I'm sure a break would not be amiss.
Keqing: No, it's fine. Really, I can handle it.
Keqing: Pengyi, please redraft our plans, make a summary report, and send it to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Keqing: I'm going into town to check the progress of the fireworks setup. I'll return shortly.
Keqing: As for you, Traveler, you're our esteemed guest. Please take the opportunity to stay in Liyue Harbor and enjoy the festivities.
Keqing: Pengyi, is everything clear? Please remember the tasks I've given you.
Pengyi: Yes, Lady Keqing! Don't worry.
Keqing: Good. Ningguang, Traveler, goodbye for now.
Pengyi: Please excuse me, Lady Ningguang, and uh... Traveler, I must get going.
Pengyi: Lady Keqing told me a great deal of information, and I have to write up the plans from scratch again, so time is of the essence.
Pengyi: Ooh! One moment, I almost forgot!
Pengyi: Here, Traveler, this is a Launch Tube. Lady Keqing said you may be interested, so she had me keep one to give to you.
Pengyi: Someone with good handicraft skills should be able to use this to design their very own fireworks. You should try it when you have the chance!
Paimon: Whew, Paimon couldn't get a single word in just now...
Paimon: Uh, well, more like Paimon didn't dare open her mouth while they were talking, but still!
Traveler: Keqing definitely had an imposing presence...
Paimon: Did you notice it too? Lady Keqing is a lot more outspoken than she used to be!
Paimon: And she seems a whole lot busier, too. Wonder why...
Ningguang: Ever since the adepti left Liyue Harbor in the hands of mortals, we Qixing have taken up the responsibility of leading the people.
Ningguang: We have taken charge of many vital tasks in various sectors, and we are responsible for planning and organizing all sorts of affairs.
Ningguang: That said, being in charge of everything inevitably takes its toll. It's exhausting at times.
Ningguang: Jiangzhou was responsible for planning the Lantern Rite in former years, but her father is getting quite old now, so she transferred to another department this year.
Ningguang: In the end, the Lantern Rite planning was left to Keqing and myself. I am the head organizer, while Keqing is responsible for the highly anticipated fireworks show.
Ningguang: Such an important event should be entrusted to the most qualified candidate. Keqing is disciplined, yet passionate about her work, so she's naturally the best fit for the job.
Paimon: She's definitely disciplined... no doubt about that.
Ningguang: Absolutely. She is strict with both herself and others, to the point that she can even become overly involved at times. She's worked several days without a break now.
Ningguang: I'm concerned about the effects it may have in the long run.
Ningguang: Finding balance is an essential concept in Liyue culture.
Ningguang: I've tried talking to her, but you know how she is... She uses her wit to talk circles around anyone...
Ningguang: Traveler, you are quite close to Keqing, why don't you try talking to her? Maybe she'd listen to someone as experienced as you.
Traveler: Sure, leave it to me.
Ningguang: Thank you, Traveler. I am glad you are able to help. Keqing can be a tough nut to crack, sometimes.
Ningguang: I still have other business to attend to at the Jade Chamber. I'll leave Keqing in your capable hands.
Black Screen Text: Ningguang leaves.
Paimon: Uh, are you sure you can really persuade Keqing to take a break? Even Ningguang herself couldn't manage to convince her...
Paimon: Besides, before you can persuade someone, you have to at least understand how they feel at the moment.
Paimon: Keqing has been working non-stop without a break.
Traveler: So she must feel... very tired?
Paimon: Duh! C'mon, everyone knows that! Think harder, how does she feel deep, deep down inside?
Paimon: Umm, or maybe... we could ask a friend. You know, someone more knowledgeable about these things?
Traveler: Let's go talk to Zhongli, then.
Paimon: Huh? Zhongli?
Traveler: He's really knowledgeable about the people of Liyue.
Paimon: Oh, there's no arguing that! Zhongli it is, then!
Paimon: Paimon thinks he's still a consultant at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Let's go see if he's there!
Traveler: I'll think of something.

## Talk 4

Ferrylady: ...
Ferrylady: Hello, how may I help you?
Traveler: We're looking for your consultant, Zhongli.
Ferrylady: Ah, yes... Well, I'm afraid he is currently out with the director.
Paimon: Out with the director? You mean, for work?
Ferrylady: The director said that they were going for a walk.
Ferrylady: If you'd prefer, you could go look for them at Third-Round Knockout.
Ferrylady: I've heard the director often goes there to do... uh, promotion.

## Talk 5

Hu Tao: Yum... Whew, I'm so full, not another bite!
Guoba: ♪!
Hu Tao: Hats off to you, Xiangling, serving the grilled fish with a dipping sauce is quite an innovative approach, the flavor is just to die for!
Xiangling: Hee-hee, that's my signature dipping sauce. I knew it would taste great!
Zhongli: Hmm. Tempered Jueyun Chili powder mixed with garlic paste and chopped scallions... Then seasoned with salt, vinegar, and soy sauce, before finally sizzling in hot oil.
Zhongli: This recipe may seem a bit crude, but is entirely hinged on the precise balancing of flavors and seasonings by the chef. Everything must be balanced just right.
Zhongli: It is the consummate mastery of this balance that turns a humble dish into an exquisite one.
Hu Tao: Oooh! That's quite the compliment, don't you think?
Xiangling: Hee-hee... I am flattered. Thank you, Mr. Zhongli!
Hu Tao: And I thought I have a way with words, but you certainly take the prize, Mr. Zhongli.
Zhongli: You are too kind, Director. Your eloquence is *ahem* infamous in Liyue Harbor.
Guoba: ♪~♪~
Hu Tao: What's that? Would you like to order something, Guoba? Please, by all means, it's my treat! I'll just open a tab under "Xiangling"!
Guoba: ?
Paimon: Hey, are you guys talking about tasty food again?
Hu Tao: Oh! It's the Traveler and Paimon! What brings you to this side of town?
Hu Tao: Hold on! Let me take a wild guess. Hmm, yes... Oh, you must be here for the Lantern Rite!
Paimon: Uh, isn't that pretty obvious? Anybody could have guessed that!
Hu Tao: Aiya, c'mon! Can't you take a joke!?
Xiangling: You came at the perfect time, I was just letting everyone try my latest dish!
Xiangling: The owner of Third-Round Knockout says it's... well, a real knockout. Mr. Zhongli and Hu Tao seem to like it too, but I think it never hurts to let more people do a taste test.
Xiangling: How about it, you two? Would you like to have a taste?
Paimon: Don't have to ask Paimon twice! Or once, even!
Traveler: Thank you, but we're here to see Mr. Zhongli.
Paimon: Huh? Y—You mean we're not gonna try any? Aww, fine, let's get down to business...
Zhongli: We meet again, Traveler. I trust your journey is going well?
Traveler: Not bad, we've learned a lot along the way.
Zhongli: Splendid, therein lies the value of a journey.
Hu Tao: So, c'mon! Why are you looking for our good consultant? Do enlighten us.
Hu Tao: And just in case you were wondering, we are on business, too! We only tried Xiangling's dish since we just happened to be here.
Paimon: Business? What kind of business would the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor possibly have during a festival?
Hu Tao: Even during the most joyous of holidays, life still follows its natural course, does it not? Is that really so surprising? But there isn't need to be alarmed, it's just a nice day today and I thought we could go for a walk while doing a little promotion for our business.
Hu Tao: You can go ahead and chat away. Xiangling and I will go have some tea with the boss over there. Zhongli, please come get me when you're through here!
Zhongli: Of course, I'll see you later, Director.
Zhongli: Now then, Traveler, what brings you to see me today?
Traveler: Well, long story short...
Black Screen Text: You explain Keqing's situation to Zhongli.
Zhongli: Hmm, yes. The Yuheng is honest, intelligent, and most diligent. She is capable of shouldering responsibilities that few others could, but everything has a balance, and one's health must certainly weigh in.
Traveler: Is there any way we can help her?
Paimon: Yeah. Everyone knows you're super knowledgeable, Paimon bets she would listen to someone like you!
Zhongli: If I were still the mighty Rex Lapis, I might be able to help her see reason. But alas, I'm now nobody but an ordinary consultant. My words no longer carry the same weight as they once did.
Zhongli: Besides, I am by no means close to the Yuheng. Taking the liberty to lecture her may just as easily produce the opposite of the desired effect.
Paimon: Oh, you're right... Then what should we do?
Zhongli: We could take a more subtle, indirect approach to the matter.
Zhongli: Such as telling a story that resonates with her, containing your message conveyed within it.
Zhongli: Such a story can be achieved by referencing topics from her daily life. The story could prove even more effective if you weave in something about someone close to her.
Paimon: Umm, Paimon doesn't really get it...
Traveler: Let's go speak with others who are familiar with Keqing.
Zhongli: I knew you'd understand what to do, haha. Well done, Traveler.
Zhongli: Go collect some source materials for your story. Of course, I can always provide you with my advice, if needed.
Zhongli: Once we have formulated the plot, you can tell the story to the Yuheng.
Traveler: Huh? Me?
Zhongli: You are on amiable terms with the Yuheng, which makes you the natural candidate.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it! So we need to talk with people who know Keqing, right? Hmm, so who should we start with?
Keqing: Greetings everyone, I hope I'm not intruding.
Paimon: Huh? Oh, L—Lady Keqing!
Keqing: Mr. Zhongli, I didn't expect to see you here. Thank you for all your assistance during the Rite of Parting.
Zhongli: You are most welcome, Yuheng. It was the least I could do.
Traveler: Erm, what are you doing here, Keqing?
Keqing: Hmm, why? And what's with your strange expression?
Keqing: Oh, I see, my apologies, I appear to have interrupted your conversation with Mr. Zhongli.
Traveler: No, no, not at all.
Paimon: Keqing, are you here looking for us?
Keqing: Yes, I was going to ask you to introduce me to the adepti. I thought that it would be fitting to send them some festive gifts on behalf of the Liyue Qixing.
Paimon: But didn't you meet them when we were fighting to defend Liyue Harbor together?
Paimon: You could just as easily go and find them in Jueyun Karst.
Keqing: Yes, but we only met briefly on that single occasion. The adepti may have already forgotten about me, and I'm concerned it would be imprudent to show up so suddenly.
Keqing: Which is why I thought it would be more appropriate to ask you to introduce me first.
Traveler: Sure, no problem.
Paimon: So you even have to run around delivering gifts in person... It sure doesn't seem easy to be a Qixing.
Traveler: We'll gladly help you.
Keqing: Thank you, Traveler. Let me go and prepare the gifts.
Keqing: I'm sorry to make you run errands with me during our big festival. I promise to make this quick, and I'll be sure to get you back in time to enjoy the fireworks show.
Traveler: Great, then we go watch the fireworks together!
Keqing: Huh? T—Together?
Keqing: Hmm, alright. I'll go to see the fireworks with you once I've finished my work.
Keqing: Speaking of which, Mr. Zhongli, the Fireworks Show will be particularly exciting this year. Please, don't miss it.
Zhongli: Ah, yes. Thank you for your kind reminder.
Keqing: I should be going now. Traveler, please come find me at the Jade Chamber once you're ready.
Paimon: And there she goes.
Zhongli: That's the Yuheng, efficient and reliable as ever.
Paimon: You're really reliable too, Zhongli!
Zhongli: Why, thank you, Paimon.
Zhongli: Please don't forget our earlier conversation. Once you've collected enough story material, we can meet here again and discuss things further.
Traveler: Did you try asking Ganyu?
Keqing: Unfortunately, Ganyu is on leave at the moment, so I'm unable to get in touch with her.
Keqing: I'm afraid I'll still require your assistance.

Ferrylady: If you're looking for the director and our consultant, you can go look for them at Third-Round Knockout. I've heard the director often goes there to do... uh, promotion.
