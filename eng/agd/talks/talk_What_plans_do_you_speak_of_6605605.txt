Traveler: What plans do you speak of?
Manua: Ah, it's Miss Amina's battle preparation and defense facilities renovation plan, as well as her personnel deployment plan.
Manua: Do you find it strange that the chief would bring her plans to me?
Manua: Heh, it's because I'm her assistant.
Manua: Amina is very bright and always used to come up with all sorts of innovative ideas... albeit mostly entertainment facilities she wanted to try out herself.
Manua: The Abyssal incursions have grown worse lately, and I've noticed that her appetite for fun has decreased considerably. Though we People of the Springs have emerged relatively unscathed, there are always others who need our help.
