# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to chat?
Freminet: Mhm... Please go ahead.
Traveler: Why don't we talk about Pers?
Freminet: ...Ah, thank you for remembering its name.
Traveler: Is there a story behind Pers's name?
Freminet: To explain it... I'll need to tell you a really, really old story I once read in a picture book.
Traveler: Ooh, I'm listening!
Freminet: Mhm... So once upon a time, in a faraway seaside town, there lived a black and white bird.
Freminet: Since birth, it spoke with a stutter, walked with a wobble, and was unable to fly, so it was always bullied by the other birds.
Freminet: Until one day, greedy pirates stole a jewel-studded diadem from the underwater palace...
Freminet: In a flash, lightning and thunder engulfed the sea, and a tsunami rose from the depths, threatening to wipe out the entire town...
Freminet: The black-and-white bird tried to leap upwards, but it still couldn't fly... In its recklessness, it crashed against the mast and sank into the ocean alongside the wrecked ship.
Freminet: The seabirds flying overhead thought it would drown right then and there, but to their surprise, it began to swim like the swiftest of fish!
Freminet: It swam and swam, until its strength finally gave out. It restored the diadem to its rightful place underwater, and immediately, the storms died down, and it was as if nothing bad had ever happened.
Freminet: As you've probably guessed by now... The bird in the story was named Pers. It was a penguin that came to town by accident.
Traveler: What a wonderful story.
Freminet: I've always admired the Pers in the story, but after reading it, what struck me the most was... its loneliness.
Freminet: So, I decided to stick close and hug Pers, so we can keep each other warm...
Traveler: Ah, I didn't know you were friends with a hero!
Freminet: ...Heh, you're right.
Traveler: Why does Pers look the way it does?
