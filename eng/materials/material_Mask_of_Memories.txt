# Mask of Memories

Hanachirusato the shrine maiden used to wear this mask. It is deeply stained on the inside.
Some memories are contained inside, through which one may learn the art of creating the Catalyst known as "Hakushin Ring."
Now that Hanachirusato has been separated from this mask, Paimon doesn't get to call her the "Masked Maiden" anymore, right?
