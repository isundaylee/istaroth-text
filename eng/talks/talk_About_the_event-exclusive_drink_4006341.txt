Traveler: About the event-exclusive drink...
Rika: Oh, you mean "Rainbow Aster"?
Rika: In the novel, this is the drink that the Kitsune Guuji made for the main character — the Shogun — when the latter was ill.
Rika: It has a most refreshing taste, owing to the addition of Mint, as well as Calla Lilies from Mondstadt.
Rika: After drinking it, the main character realizes that the Kitsune Guuji was not angry, but was instead being supportive all this time, and so becomes able to overcome a crisis.
Rika: After the novel came out, Yae Publishing House has received a constant stream of letters from readers, expressing interest in having just such a drink.
Rika: As such, we've used the occasion of the Irodori Festival to develop this drink alongside Sailing Breeze.
