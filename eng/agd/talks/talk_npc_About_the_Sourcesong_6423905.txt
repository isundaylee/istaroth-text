Traveler: About the Sourcesong...
Arasudraka: The song that Golden Nara and Aranara sang at Festival Utsava is the brightest, most satisfying song I've ever heard, like the most plump pomegranate.
Arasudraka: Perhaps this is the melody that is closest to the Sourcesong.
Arasudraka: I think the longer Golden Nara's journey, the closer the Sourcesong will be.
