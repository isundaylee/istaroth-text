Traveler: Are you looking for some Mint?
Murakami: Mint, yes, Mint's what I need... With Mint, I could create whole new flavors...
Murakami: I'm guessing you accepted my commission? In which case, I'm guessing you also have 15 Mints for me...?
Traveler: You guess correctly, Sir.
Traveler: Not yet, actually.
Murakami: Oh, okay then. Well, just bring them here when you get them.

Traveler: Festival snacks...
Murakami: Ha, though we called them festival snacks, they really are no different from ordinary dishes. The difference lies in the wrappings.
Murakami: It's just as delicious, though! Besides, food you eat at festivals always feel a little more special somehow, don't they?
Murakami: Either way, my shop is always open whether there's an event on or not. You're welcome to come and stuff your face if you ever get hungry.

Murakami: I'll definitely take good care of you and Miss Kamisato the next time you two come again.

Traveler: I've almost got it down.
Murakami: I like that confidence!
Murakami: I was about to say that you can come and ask me if you have any issues with the recipe, but it seems like you've got it all under control!
Murakami: Ah, it'd be wonderful if everyone was able to enjoy delicious food that they made by themselves.
