Traveler: What's wrong?
Mister Qi: Mmm, I suppose I can tell you. Before me is an opportunity that will make me, should it succeed, or break me should it fail...
Mister Qi: My friend heard tell from the Jade Chamber that, if true, could be a sale of a lifetime.
Mister Qi: But I lack sufficient capital, and so here I am at the Northland Bank looking for a loan. But there can be no turning back if I borrow this sum...
Mister Qi: *sigh* If this information is false, then it would be like falling into a bottomless chasm. The Northland Bank is no lenient creditor...
Traveler: What's this about the Northland Bank?
Mister Qi: Do you mean to ask about how its debtors end up? I doubt anyone could tell you.
Mister Qi: I knew someone who fell afoul of the Northland Bank due to his failing business. He fled deep into the mountains and forests to avoid them, but they found him eventually.
Mister Qi: I have never heard from him again. No one knows where he has gone.
Mister Qi: I don't fear death, but what will my wife and children do without me...
