Masseira: "Flap flap flap," and the little canary returns! Hehe! Congratulations!
Traveler: What?
Masseira: Look at you! Look. At. You. The little canary got the poisonous scorpion all tied around itself without even knowing what happened... Amazing! Truly amazing!
Masseira: But... that little wildcat, like you, is so very ignorant of the great net she has found herself in, relying only on intuition and instinct to struggle and strain...
Masseira: "Ripping, tearing..." Will she sink deeper, I wonder?
Traveler: What are you even saying?
Masseira: Oh, oh! I have aroused your anger, I see!
Masseira: Haha. It is nothing... Please, take care of her, for she is a good child.
Traveler: I'm no canary.
Masseira: Oh, and are you a little falcon, then? Hah, but you must overcome my falcon first for that to be the case!
