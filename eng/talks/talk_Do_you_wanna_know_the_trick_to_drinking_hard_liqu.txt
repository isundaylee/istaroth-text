Kaeya: #Do you wanna know the trick to drinking hard liquor, {NICKNAME}? It's all about pacing yourself.
Kaeya: Take a small sip, then give your tastebuds some time to rest. The burning sensation spreads to your lips, then the aftertaste kicks in. Once you can take a breath in without tasting anything, then you can take your next sip.
Kaeya: Stick to that pace, and even Death After Noon loses its power over you. I like to think that the same principle applies in combat.
