Traveler: The Cygnus Fleet?
Little Yue: It's my very own fleet! It's just me right now, but one day, it'll grow into something big!
Little Yue: My Ma and Pa were both sailors in the fleet, but they were returned to the sea during a voyage, so Captain Beidou took me in...
Little Yue: We have a saying here, it says "the new surpasses the old." Captain Beidou is the one who raised me, my fleet mustn't be an embarrassment to her!
Little Yue: I've always wanted to be a sailor myself, but the Captain's forbidden me to go out to sea, saying that it's too dangerous. So this time, I've secretly stowed aboard...
Little Yue: I got an earful from Uncle Juza, but I got to go out to sea, and that makes me a sailor now!
