Traveler: Hello there.
Iaune: Hello! I'll get the materials needed today right away— Oh, it's you!
Iaune: We meet again, Traveler. It's my pleasure.
Iaune: And no, that's not mere formality. Seeing you is like seeing a gear turning on an intricate axis within a clock — it's as if my life is still on the right track.
