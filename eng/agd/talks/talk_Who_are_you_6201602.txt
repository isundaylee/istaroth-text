# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Who are you?
Lan: If you're looking for the Master of the Liyue Adventurers' Guild, I regret to inform you that, that would be me.
Lan: By which I mean, don't expect any help from me on Guild-related matters. I avoid involving myself in such bothersome affairs.
Lan: That is, unless you bring news about the sword.
Traveler: What sword?
Lan: My older brother's sword. If I find it, I can finally give him a proper burial...
Lan: It's the only fitting way to go for a martial artist like him.
Lan: It's a flat blade, sharp enough to slice an airborne hair in two. It's named "Unseen Razor."
Traveler: How did you become Master of the Liyue branch?
Lan: Ugh, why does everyone ask me the same question... I will make an exception for you, though, and give you the full story.
Lan: I used to be a mercenary. I joined the Adventurers' Guild so I could take advantage of their superior intelligence network and track down the sword.
Lan: I may not be very literate but I can read the word "sword." So I just took on every single commission that had something to do with a sword.
Lan: Then, just when I'd finished my eighthâ€” Or was it my ninth commission? Anyway, I'd just finished it, and then word came from the headquarters in Snezhnaya that I'd apparently completed two S-rank commissions.
Lan: ...And suddenly I found myself promoted to branch Guild Master. It was all very strange indeed.
Traveler: I'll let you know if I find anything.
Lan: Oh, thanks! I love meeting people like you who are up for everything.
Lan: I am grateful to you, newcomer. It looks like it was worth me joining the Guild after all.
