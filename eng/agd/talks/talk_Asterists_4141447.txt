Traveler: Asterists?
Dr. Edith: Yes. They are also known as the "Windblume Traditionalists."
Dr. Edith: As opposed to a celebration of romance, they believe that the Windblume Festival is more about commemorating the liberation of Old Mondstadt from tyranny.
Dr. Edith: As far as I'm aware, "Windblume" was possibly once a code word for people who wished to stay in contact and plot resistance in secret...
Dr. Edith: But most people have forgotten this layer of meaning, and so those who feel that this festival should stand for the liberation of Mondstadt have become the minority.
Dr. Edith: Windwheel Asters bear the title of "the visible winds," and so the traditionalists have chosen it to represent them.
