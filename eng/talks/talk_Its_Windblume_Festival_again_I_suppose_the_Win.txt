Marla: It's Windblume Festival again... I suppose the Windblumes must be dandelions, after all.
Marla: No matter how strong the wind, it can only blow dandelions away, but it will never cause them to perish.
Marla: But this is just my opinion. But it may be for this reason that dandelions became the symbols of love.
Marla: I hope... I hope that our love will be just as resilient.
