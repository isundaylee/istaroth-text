Smiley Yanxiao: I might not have won this iteration of Masterful Chefs, but I definitely learned a lot from the competition itself!
Smiley Yanxiao: I was just planning to invent a few new dishes for the Moonchase Festival and maybe learn a few things from Chef Xiangling, but I sure learned quite a few unexpected things, too!
Smiley Yanxiao: ...Actually, what are you doing, just sauntering on into the kitchen again?

### Talk 0 related talk 0

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: That they did, alright. There's a guest lodging here named Ling'guan. She ordered a serving of Almond Tofu a while earlier and, after paying, wanted me to deliver it to someplace north of Dihua Marsh.
Smiley Yanxiao: But we've been really busy here at the inn, and I haven't the time to go out and deliver the food myself. If you could help me out, that would be great. I'll be sure to compensate you fairly.

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: What, you here to lend me a hand?
Smiley Yanxiao: Well, you're just in time. Someone named Ling'guan ordered a Matsutake Meat Roll from me.
Smiley Yanxiao: She wanted me to send it to some spot northwest of Dihua Marsh. The Mora's already been paid out, too.
Smiley Yanxiao: Well, if you've got time, how about helping me deliver it? You'll be compensated.

### Talk 0 related talk 2

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: Sure did. That... guest, Tingfang, ordered some Black-Back Perch Stew earlier.
Smiley Yanxiao: He said that he wanted it delivered to some place in Sal Terrae...
Smiley Yanxiao: If you're up for it, why don't you help me take it out to him? You'll be paid for your work.

### Talk 0 related talk 3

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: So it's like this: that air-headed Ling'guan ordered some Come And Get It, saying that she'd come back and eat it later. But my money's on her having wandered off somewhere and gotten lost.
Smiley Yanxiao: Go deliver this to her. *Steady now, and don't run around however you like*, or it'll spill.
Smiley Yanxiao: *Try to avoid touching elemental stuff as well, or the taste might get all mixed up*.
Smiley Yanxiao: If it goes bad, come back here and I'll whip up another serving for you.

### Talk 0 related talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: That fellow Tingfang ordered some Black-Back Perch Stew. He should have headed off to Qingce Village by now.
Smiley Yanxiao: This Black-Back Perch Stew has had greater emphasis placed on the quality of its soup. So you *can't fly or climb all over the place*, or you'll spill it for sure. You'll want to make the delivery quick, too.
Smiley Yanxiao: If you meet with an accident along the way, come back here and I'll make you another serving.

### Talk 0 related talk 5

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: Aye, you heard right. Ling'guan ordered some Stir-Fried Filet before heading northwest.
Smiley Yanxiao: If it isn't too much trouble, deliver it to her while it's hot, will you?
Smiley Yanxiao: If you meet with an accident along the way, come back here and I'll make you another serving.

### Talk 0 related talk 6

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: That's right. Ling'guan asked for some Almond Tofu before heading off to Mingyun Village again.
Smiley Yanxiao: It's an odd place, Mingyun Village is.
Smiley Yanxiao: In any case, I hope to get someone who can help me deliver it to her.

### Talk 0 related talk 7

Traveler: About Sausage...
Smiley Yanxiao: Yes, I've just posted a commission for some. Have you already prepared two Sausages?
Traveler: Yes, here they are.
Traveler: No, not yet.
Smiley Yanxiao: Well, time's ticking and I've got food to prepare. Bring them to me as soon as they're ready, I've got customers waiting.

### Talk 0 related talk 8

Traveler: About Ham...
Smiley Yanxiao: Huh? Ah yes, you must mean the commission I posted. So, have you prepared the two pieces of Ham?
Traveler: Yes, the Ham's ready!
Traveler: Not yet...
Smiley Yanxiao: Well get to it then. Be sure to bring me the Ham as soon as you've got it, I've got some new dish ideas to try.

### Talk 0 related talk 9

Traveler: About Bacon...
Smiley Yanxiao: Yes, that's my commission. Have you already prepared two strips of Bacon?
Traveler: Yep, here they are.
Traveler: Not yet...
Smiley Yanxiao: Let me know as soon as you've got the Bacon ready. That cheapskate is waiting for me to deliver him some food.

### Talk 0 related talk 10

Traveler: Oh, sorry...
Smiley Yanxiao: It's fine. Kindness should be repaid in kind and however it goes.
Smiley Yanxiao: I'm hardly about to kick you out, not after you helped me with that ghost problem and all.
Traveler: Tell me a bit about your life to date.
Smiley Yanxiao: What're you asking that for? Aren't you here to cook?
Smiley Yanxiao: You're not the first person to show surprise at me working as a chef, though.
Smiley Yanxiao: My story goes like this: I actually used to be a thief until I stole from the boss.
Smiley Yanxiao: I took a beating for it and was locked up for a while.
Smiley Yanxiao: After I got out, the boss took me on to help out in the kitchen.
Smiley Yanxiao: I find I'm much happier as a sous-chef than I was as a thief.
Smiley Yanxiao: I feel like this is the real me.
Traveler: How've things been going lately?
Smiley Yanxiao: Pretty good. Ever since then, I've stopped seeing anything weird.
Smiley Yanxiao: But even if something pops up again, I'll be fine. The boss met an exorcist called Chongyun through some friends.
Smiley Yanxiao: If another ghost pops up, we'll call him in. Besides, they say he's pretty good at his job.

Traveler: Bye-bye.
Smiley Yanxiao: Go well, eat well.

## Talk 1

Jiangxue: Ah, so Yanxiao came in second this year. A shame, but also not a bad thing.
Jiangxue: Cooking is much like martial arts. One can only improve when rivals to compete with.
Jiangxue: I'll bet that he's cooking up some new recipes as we speak. Well, I sure hope I'll get to try some of it.

### Talk 1 related talk 0

Traveler: Who are you?
Jiangxue: I'm just a guy with a fishing rod and plenty of time on my hands.
Jiangxue: You really want to get on a first-name basis, huh? ...I stopped using my real name a long time ago.
Jiangxue: Just call me Jiangxue.

### Talk 1 related talk 1

Traveler: Goodbye.
Jiangxue: Goodbye.

## Talk 2

Huai'an: Hello! I am Huai'an, innkeeper of the Wangshu Inn.
Huai'an: Our inn is a fine vantage spot for moon-viewing. The view from the top floor is excellent, with obstructed views of the moon and of the surrounding scenery alike.

### Talk 2 related talk 0

Traveler: How's business been lately?
Huai'an: Thanks to yourself and all our dear guests, business has been going reasonably well. We will get by.
Huai'an: Haha, it's getting livelier again.
Traveler: What can you tell me about the rumors?
Huai'an: Rumors? What rumors?
Huai'an: If you mean someone's been bad-mouthing the Wangshu Inn, don't believe a word of what you hear.
Huai'an: But if you just wanted to get the lowdown about what's been going on recently...
Huai'an: The Fatui's presence in Liyue Harbor has been growing recently. It looks like trouble is brewing.
Huai'an: Now it's your turn! Any interesting stories to share with me?
Traveler: Who's this lovely doggie?
Huai'an: This is Richie! We called him that hoping it would bring us good luck.
Huai'an: He's a good boy, aren't you Richie? He doesn't make a mess and he's good with the guests.

### Talk 2 related talk 1

Traveler: Who's that over there? She doesn't look like she's from Liyue.
Huai'an: Ah yes, that would be my wife. She moved from Mondstadt to marry me.
Huai'an: When I was a child we used to sing this nursery rhyme about Liyue women: "Half the girls marry to a winery town, the other half sail to a faraway land."
Huai'an: Oh, how the tables have turned... I feel quite proud to have broken the mold! Hahaha.
Huai'an: Goldet is very sharp. She picks up on all these little details about people and figures out their backgrounds.

### Talk 2 related talk 2

Traveler: Please excuse me.
Huai'an: Alright, goodbye. Stop in for a chat anytime! You're always welcome at the Wangshu Inn.

## Talk 3

Verr Goldet: Hello! Oh! Well, you certainly are a returning customer. Welcome back.
Verr Goldet: You've come at a good time: the Moonchase Festival is the best time for viewing the moon and enjoying gourmet food, and Wangshu Inn has plenty of both.

### Talk 3 related talk 0

Traveler: I'd like to buy something to eat.
Verr Goldet: What'll you have? We have dishes from both Mondstadt and Liyue, and our Almond Tofu is particularly popular.

### Talk 3 related talk 1

Traveler: Hey boss lady.
Verr Goldet: Ugh... how many times do I have to tell you, it's not "boss lady."
Verr Goldet: I'm the boss here at Wangshu Inn.
Verr Goldet: Not boss lady. Just boss.
Traveler: I've heard the rumors...
Verr Goldet: Hahaha, well I'd hardly be able to operate an inn in this location without connections with the Qixing.
Verr Goldet: What I mean is I obviously need their approval.
Verr Goldet: All that other nonsense is just rumors, though.
Verr Goldet: Speaking of which, have you got any interesting news to share?
Traveler: Whose is this kitty?
Verr Goldet: *sigh* ...This cat invited itself here... But it's cute, so I let it stay.
Verr Goldet: Its name is Wei. That was quite simply the first name we thought of.
Verr Goldet: You might find Wei causes a bit of mischief — you know what cats are like. But please refrain from stooping to the same level yourself.

### Talk 3 related talk 2

Traveler: Tell me about your husband.
Verr Goldet: Over there. He's the innkeeper.
Verr Goldet: Don't be led astray by the cheeky grin on his face. He is a rather formidable martial artist.
Verr Goldet: I also practice martial arts, as do the kitchen staff. It is a hiring requirement.
Verr Goldet: You have to have nimble use of your hands and feet when you're serving guests, don't you think?

### Talk 3 related talk 3

Traveler: Goodbye.
Verr Goldet: Safe travels.

## Talk 4

Madame Ping: Oh, child, it's you! The Moonchase Festival is a most lively time here in Liyue, so feel free to walk around and see the sights.

### Talk 4 related talk 0

Traveler: About the Stove God...
Madame Ping: Well, now you know that the Moonchase Festival was instituted by Rex Lapis as a way of remember that friend of ours.
Madame Ping: You call him Guoba nowadays, do you not? Hehe, I suppose it was destiny that led Xiangling to rename the God of the Stove for a dish they both enjoyed.
Madame Ping: Take him around Liyue Harbor — you and Xiangling both — a little more, would you?
Madame Ping: I'm sure he would be gladdened to see Liyue Harbor as populous as it presently is.

### Talk 4 related talk 1

Traveler: About the Moonchase Festival...
Madame Ping: The meaning of the Festival in ages past was quite different. It was about the ancients of Liyue seeking the adeptal path.
Madame Ping: Nowadays, it's more about admiring the moon, eating, and enjoying our time together with one another.
Madame Ping: The meaning of festivals will shift with time, and some traditions will be forgotten. However, everyone's hopes for the future will remain the same, no matter what the day or age.

### Talk 4 related talk 2

Traveler: Admiring the flowers?
Madame Ping: That I am. One season after the next, this flower blooms, then falls, only to bloom again. And on it goes — just like Liyue.
Madame Ping: Look over here, and over here. So many flowers are blooming! It looks like this will be a blessed year.

### Talk 4 related talk 3

Traveler: What type of flowers are these?
Madame Ping: These are Glaze Lilies. Probably the last surviving ones in all of Liyue Harbor.
Madame Ping: People say that the sound of singing nourishes them, and helps them grow...
Madame Ping: But the sound of fighting, of cursing... it is poison to them, and eats away at their roots.
Madame Ping: That is why, over centuries of strife, they have disappeared from Liyue's landscape.

### Talk 4 related talk 4

Traveler: Goodbye.
Madame Ping: Goodbye, young one. If you are ever passing by Jueyun Karst, please pass on my regards to my old friends.
Madame Ping: If it is meant to be that you see them... then you will see them.

## Talk 5

Traveler: About the Stove God...
Madame Ping: Well, now you know that the Moonchase Festival was instituted by Rex Lapis as a way of remember that friend of ours.
Madame Ping: You call him Guoba nowadays, do you not? Hehe, I suppose it was destiny that led Xiangling to rename the God of the Stove for a dish they both enjoyed.
Madame Ping: Take him around Liyue Harbor — you and Xiangling both — a little more, would you?
Madame Ping: I'm sure he would be gladdened to see Liyue Harbor as populous as it presently is.

## Talk 6

Uncle Tian: Hello there, youngster. Here to enjoy the Moonchase Festival?
Uncle Tian: Back in the day, we would eat Wangxiao Cakes, drink Laurel Wine, and gather together with family and friends to share our hopes for the future.
Uncle Tian: Nowadays, the number dishes to be had has grown and grown, and we aren't quite as particular as we once were — we simply eat whatever we wish.
Uncle Tian: Take the opportunity to try some more of Liyue's delicacies, eh?

### Talk 6 related talk 0

Traveler: Hello.
Uncle Tian: Hey there! Never expected any young 'uns would come talking to me at my age.
Uncle Tian: Find yourself a spot to sit. You can call me Uncle Tian. Makes this old codger feel like a young man again.
Uncle Tian: Huh? You think I still look young?
Uncle Tian: Well, youth isn't really a matter of age... it's more to do with how much pain and suffering you've experienced in your life.

### Talk 6 related talk 1

Traveler: Tell me about your boat.
Uncle Tian: This boat? You like her huh? Been with me all my life...
Uncle Tian: Back when I was a young fella, I was poorer than a panhandler, but at least I had it in me to haul in whatever snagged my line!
Uncle Tian: Things you do for yourself, you yourself get to reap the rewards for. How much you sweat determines how much you get... Those were the good ole days, could just keep goin' an' never get tired.
Uncle Tian: ...
Uncle Tian: ...
Traveler: ...?
Uncle Tian: Ahhh, what was I saying... Lost my train of thought...
Uncle Tian: Oh, right. Anyway, I struggled for the first... I dunno how long, but with perseverance and bit of luck, I got my own business started up and didn't have to do all the fishin' myself anymore.
Uncle Tian: But, everyone's out tryna swindle each other, an' before I knew it, I'd lost sight of myself.
Uncle Tian: So to bring myself back to my roots, I bring my tired old self here to fish and talk about the good ole days.
Uncle Tian: Back when I was a young fella, I was poorer than a panhandler...
Traveler: You ahh... said that part already...
Uncle Tian: ...Whaddya mean I said that already? Don't butt in when the old fella's talkin'. Now back then I was poorer than a panhandler...
Uncle Tian: but at least I had it in me to haul 'em in...
Uncle Tian: ...

### Talk 6 related talk 2

Traveler: Okay, great. Ahh... Bye.
Uncle Tian: Oh, alright then. Be careful out there young 'un.
Uncle Tian: If you happen to pass by Qingce Village and see my dear Yundan, be sure to speak with her, let her know I'm alive, yeah?

## Talk 7

Chef Mao: Here for the Wanmin Restaurant experience? Hi, I'm Chef Mao. Everyone in Chihu Rock will have heard of me.
Chef Mao: My name might not be the most famous around, but my daughter Xiangling is the champion of this year's Masterful Chefs. Now hers is a name I'm sure everyone's heard of!
Chef Mao: Haha! That's my dear girl alright, our very own culinary genius. Her future is very bright indeed!

### Talk 7 related talk 0

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: Yes, that's correct. A while ago, a customer named Tingfang ordered a bowl of Jewelry Soup from me. He paid in advance, saying that he wanted it delivered to the Dunyu Ruins.
Chef Mao: I still need to man the restaurant, so I don't have time to make the delivery. It would be great if you're willing to go in my place.

### Talk 7 related talk 1

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: Ah, right. Yes, someone named Tingfang did order Jade Parcels from me.
Chef Mao: He paid quite promptly, and asked that I deliver it to him near Guyun Stone Forest at a later time.
Chef Mao: But I need to man the restaurant at the moment. So, could you deliver it to him for me?

### Talk 7 related talk 2

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: That's right. A kid named Zi'rui ordered Mora Meat from us.
Chef Mao: He wanted us to deliver it to a place near Luhua Pool.
Chef Mao: Since I have my hands full manning the restaurant at the moment, could you help me with that delivery?

### Talk 7 related talk 3

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: Indeed. A fellow named Tingfang ordered some Jueyun Chili Chicken and asked for a delivery.
Chef Mao: This Jueyun Chili Chicken won't hold up if you *fly or climb all over the place, if you touch anything elements, or if you take too long*. Neglect one of these and you could ruin the taste.
Chef Mao: If something happens along the way, come back here and I'll make another serving. Whatever you do, don't bring the name of Wanmin Restaurant down.

### Talk 7 related talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: A guest named Ling'guan ordered some Come And Get It from us, mentioning that it should be delivered to Jueyun Karst at a later time.
Chef Mao: As if Jueyun Karst was a border that ordinary mortals could trespass!
Chef Mao: Ahem. Well, whatever the case, could you help us deliver this order to Jueyun Karst? Let's see if we can get it there in time.

### Talk 7 related talk 5

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: That's right. That boy Zi'rui ordered some Lotus Seed and Bird Egg Soup from us. As I recall, he should be off wandering in the Guyun Stone Forest right about now.
Chef Mao: So many young people, all headed out to that weird place — what is Liyue coming to nowadays?
Chef Mao: Whatever the case may be, could I trouble you to deliver this meal to him? *Just don't fly about too much,* or the soup'll spill out.

### Talk 7 related talk 6

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: You heard correctly. Someone named Tingfang ordered a serving of Jewelry Soup earlier before heading off to Qingxu Pool.
Chef Mao: I don't know what matter he needs to attend to, but I can say with confidence that you can't find any fault with our Jewelry Soup.
Chef Mao: Could I trouble you to deliver this Jewelry Soup for me? *Just try not to use your wind glider to get there*, or some of the soup might spill.

### Talk 7 related talk 7

Traveler: Can I get food to-go?
Chef Mao: Sure! What do you feel like having?

### Talk 7 related talk 8

Traveler: Tell me more about the Wanmin Restaurant.
Chef Mao: Well, I'm the chef. I may not be quite the culinary legend that my daughter is, but you can be sure the Wanmin Restaurant is a cut above all those time-honored brands you see around!

### Talk 7 related talk 9

Traveler: Goodbye.
Chef Mao: Take care now. Do visit again when you're feeling hungry!

## Talk 8

Geri: The Moonchase Festival is here, and with it, the Masterful Chefs tournament. All the Liyue locals are getting fired up about good food again, it seems.
Geri: Should I take this chance to try a few more Liyue dishes? Oh, but the food here is just...

### Talk 8 related talk 0

Traveler: About Sweet Madame...
Geri: Yes, that's my commission. Have you brought me two Sweet Madames?
Traveler: Yes, here they are.
Traveler: No, not yet...
Geri: Please bring me them as soon as possible. I need to get over the taste of that Zhongyuan Chop Suey... Yuck!

### Talk 8 related talk 1

Traveler: About Radish Veggie Soup...
Geri: Yes, that's my commission. Have you already prepared three bowls of Radish Veggie Soup?
Traveler: Yes, here they are.
Traveler: Not yet...
Geri: Alright, well bring them to me as soon as they're ready. I'm sure my sister would like to have some, too.

### Talk 8 related talk 2

Traveler: About Tea Break Pancakes...
Geri: Ah yes, that would be my commission. Have you already prepared two Tea Break Pancakes?
Traveler: Yep, here they are.
Traveler: Not yet.
Geri: Please remember to bring them to me as soon as they're ready. It's been quite some time since I've had Tea Break Pancakes...

### Talk 8 related talk 3

Traveler: About Flaming Red Bolognese...
Geri: Oh right, you must've seen my commission then. Have you prepared two dishes of Flaming Red Bolognese?
Traveler: I certainly have, here they are.
Traveler: Not yet...
Geri: Aw alright, just let me know as soon as they're ready.
Geri: I can't even remember the last time I had Flaming Red Bolognese.

### Talk 8 related talk 4

Geri: Who are you?
Geri: My name is Geri. My sister Freki and I are "bon vivant" travelers in search of fine cuisine. Our aim is to taste and see all that the seven nations have to offer.
Geri: But we never expected to meet such an unprecedented challenge on our very first stop of the trip...
Geri: The people of Liyue are so unpleasant.

### Talk 8 related talk 5

Geri: About food and drink...
Geri: I absolutely cannot stand Zhongyuan Chop Suey, it's practically inedible!
Geri: Back in Mondstadt, my favorite food is Moon Pie.
Geri: It's a pie made with seasonal fruits, pieces of cheese, and chicken. When enjoyed together with a special fruit cocktail, it is most superb.
Geri: I hardly suspected that the neighboring Liyue cuisine would differ so greatly from our own. Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined people that would make food from animal innards.
Geri: I still need some time to mentally prepare myself, whew...

### Talk 8 related talk 6

Geri: Bon appétit.
Geri: May the God of Anemo bless you.
Geri: Alas, shall the very first stop already hail the end of our journey across the seven nations?

## Talk 9

Freki: *sigh* It's the Moonchase Festival, and the food here's only getting better... But my brother is still as weak as ever...
Freki: I've heard that this iteration of Masterful Chefs has seen quite a few new dishes come to light. You know what? I'm just going to drag him off to try them all one by one!
Freki: I'm pumped to try something different form the usual fare. After all, they're just... you know, there.

### Talk 9 related talk 0

Freki: Do you dislike Liyue cuisine?
Freki: It's not that I dislike it, let's just say that I'm... disappointed.
Freki: Take Zhongyuan Chop Suey, for example. All the spices they use completely overwhelm the natural flavor of the ingredients. Apart from the powerful spicy and salty flavors, there is no taste of the actual ingredients.
Freki: I had anticipated that it would be a more shocking taste, but I didn't at all expect this.
Freki: We'll consult the Teyvat Travel Guide again to see where we should head next on our culinary journey.

### Talk 9 related talk 1

Traveler: Have you seen somebody who looks similar to me?
Freki: Similar looking to you... a sibling, you mean? Not that I remember.
Freki: I understand how you must feel. If I were to get separated from my brother, I mean, if one of us wandered off and got lost or something, that would be... *sigh*
Freki: In any case, I will help you keep an eye out during your travels. May you find them soon.

### Talk 9 related talk 2

Freki: Goodbye.
Freki: Goodbye. We'll be heading out shortly ourselves.

## Talk 10

Yiran: Manager Kuan! I want the moon!
Manager Kuan: Hey, aren't each of your requests becoming less reasonable than the last? Also, for the last time, just call me "Daddy."
Yiran: Nope. Also, my requests are not that unreasonable.
Yiran: Isn't the Moonchase Festival all about chasing the moon? If you can get it for me, Manager Kuan, then no one will have to chase it.
Yiran: That would make you everyone's hero, Manager Kuan!
Manager Kuan: I'm not some hero, I'm just Kuan... No, wait, I'm your Daddy!
Yiran: Well, if you're my Daddy, and then you can fulfill my wishes, right? I'll study hard, and you'll get me the moon. That's fair, right?
Manager Kuan: I don't think this is a question of fairness. It's more that... I can't get the moon in the first place.
Yiran: *sigh* Then until you get the moon, you're not a hero, you're Manager Kuan.

## Talk 11

Yicheng: Hello there! *LOUD RUMBLING* Happy *RUMBLE* Moonchase Festival...
Yicheng: Eat more at the *RUMBLE* Masterful Chefs...

### Talk 11 related talk 0

Yicheng: Hello, do you *RUMBLE*
Yicheng: Ugh, my stomach is making an awful racket again. I was saying, do you need any *RUMBLE*
Traveler: Uh, you were saying?
Yicheng: *sigh* My stomach acts up like this every time I'm hungry. Rumble this and rumble that, and it's really loud, too. I can't even hear the sound of my own voice.
Yicheng: Although *RUMBLE* went to Bubu Pharmacy to get myself checked, but the doctor said that I was not sick, just hungry — so there's no cure for my *GROWL*
Yicheng: The doctor said that I just needed to eat full meals, but I... I've always had a bigger *GRUMBLE* than most. If I were to eat my fill every time, I'd burn a hole right through my wallet.
Yicheng: Jiayi tells me that if my main meals don't fill me up yet, I should buy a little something to fill in the gaps in between so it doesn't affect my work.
Yicheng: "Fill in the gaps," he says, but I've got a long list of dishes I'd like to eat, and I'm not sure which is best for filling my stomach.
Yicheng: Traveler, you're experienced in the outdoor life. Surely you know what foods fill your stomach best?
Yicheng: Could you help me pick the most filling and delicious dish from my list?
Traveler: What would you like to eat this time?
Yicheng: Oh, there's plenty... Let me think...

### Talk 11 related talk 1

Traveler: What was that noise?
Yicheng: Oh, it's just... *LOUD RUMBLING*
Yicheng: My tummy rumbling... *LOUD RUMBLING*
Yicheng: Because... *LOUD RUMBLING*
Yicheng: I'm always hungry, so it always... *LOUD RUMBLING* rumbles... *LOUD RUMBLING*
Traveler: ...Are you sure you're okay?
Yicheng: I'm fine... *LOUD RUMBLING*
Yicheng: Apart from the fact that the... *LOUD RUMBLING* rumbling is so loud...
Yicheng: That it drowns out my... *LOUD RUMBLING* voice...
Yicheng: Everything else is... *LOUD RUMBLING* fine...
Traveler: Should I run and get you a bite to eat!?
Yicheng: That would be amazing!
Yicheng: Right now, I could go for a *LOUD RUMBLING* ...
Yicheng: And I could murder a *LOUD RUMBLING* ...
Yicheng: Also, I've got a real craving for *LOUD RUMBLING* with a side of *LOUD RUMBLING* ...
Yicheng: ...That should do it. Thank you so much!

### Talk 11 related talk 2

Traveler: See you.
Yicheng: Goodbye *LOUD RUMBLING* ...
Yicheng: Enjoy the rest of your *LOUD RUMBLING* ...

## Talk 12

Huihui: C'mon, Li Cuisine was clearly the superior tradition this time at Masterful Chefs!
Hao: Oh sure, that sounds like something only Li lovers would say!
Huihui: Well, why don't you just accept that there's nothing redeemable about Yue Cuisine? Did you see that boiled fish dish in the qualifiers? Made that judge's face turn green just from tasting it! You could smell the rank flavor of soil from a mile away...
Hao: W—Well, it's not like Li Cuisine fared any better. I heard that one of the judges failed to show up at the finals because they got a tummy ache from tasting some Li Cuisine during the semi-finals!
Huihui: Nonsense! A tummy ache's got nothing to do with the dish's taste. Li Cuisine is just superior!
Hao: Hmph, you're clearly only saying that because you've never properly tried Yue food before. I bet you've never even BEEN to the Xinyue Kiosk!
Huihui: And I bet YOU have never had proper Li cuisine at Liuli Pavilion!

## Talk 13

Linlang: Welcoming the bright moonlight to illuminate the adeptal path — what a romantic scene!
Linlang: I should really start collecting some antiques related to the festival...

### Talk 13 related talk 0

Linlang: Regarding the Nameless Treasure...
Linlang: This thing you've brought... It looks pretty good. This pattern also seems quite old indeed. Hold on while I open it.
Linlang: There are some defects here and there, but if you're eager to have it taken off your hands, I can offer you a price. It'll be fair, but it won't be high.
Linlang: I just had a look at this one. These markings are definitely those of Liyue, and you can see inscribed here an anecdote about Azhdaha.
Linlang: They say that Azhdaha was a dragon spawned by a convergence of the spirits of Geo in Liyue, and that even Rex Lapis could not easily subdue it.
Linlang: Rex Lapis thus summoned three adepti to his aid, and together they created a cavernous realm.
Linlang: Rex Lapis then battled the creature, luring it into the realm, before ordering the adepti to seal the entrance, trapping Azhdaha within.
Linlang: The patterns on the thing you brought seem to describe the three adepti joining hands to create the cavernous realm.
Linlang: I guess that there should at least be three relics of this kind. Combining all three should give us the complete item.
Traveler: You know all this...
Linlang: Well, I do trade in items of all kinds. A little general knowledge here and there couldn't hurt.
Linlang: Ah, but I digress. As I said earlier, there should be three of this item. One of them alone is likely not going to fetch a high price.
Linlang: But if you could gather all three, that would be a different story. But this looks to be quite ancient. Gathering all three might be too tall a task...
Traveler: Liyue truly is a mystical place...
Linlang: Now this I'm not certain of, but a senior of mine once told me that Liyue is too large, and its history is, similarly, far too long.
Linlang: Don't be surprised if you find strange relics in Liyue. What we know of Liyue's lengthy history is but a single drop in the wide ocean.

Traveler: Regarding the Nameless Treasure...
Linlang: If my guess isn't off, the object you brought previously is one of three.
Linlang: It will only be complete once all three objects are gathered together.
Linlang: If you could find them all, I would be more than willing to make you a generous offer.
Linlang: I fear that they may be from too ancient a time, however, and that gathering them... could be difficult.

Traveler: Regarding that ring...
Linlang: Oh, you've considered the matter? Will you sell or not, then?

### Talk 13 related talk 3

Traveler: Could you help us look at this antique?
Linlang: An antique? Well, you've come to the right person. I'd say that I'm the fairest at valuating such things in all of Liyue. Let's see it.
Linlang: Hmm, both the gemstone and the band are of fine quality, and it is very ancient... Yet it is very well-preserved — highly unusual.
Linlang: Still, I can't say I've ever heard the phrase "Disaster runs rampant throughout the world , and all who live do so in agony."
Linlang: Never mind that. Where did you find this ring?
Traveler: In a ruin near Cuijue Slope.
Linlang: You... You're a fair hand at this, aren't you? Not many dare to go there to hunt for treasure.
Linlang: Were those ruins surrounded by nine pillars, with a stone tablet in the center, by any chance?
Linlang: Don't look so surprised. I've heard many people who come to do business with me mention that place. They always say that such a large formation must have some sort of treasure within.
Linlang: They even say that those pillars and that ruin were built by Liyue's forebears in order to quell conflict...
Linlang: But I suppose that's just a legend. After all, if nine stone pillars could quell strife, this world would have been at peace long ago.
Linlang: But regardless of whether this legend is true or not, this ring was found in that ruin, and has to be related to that legend.
Linlang: It's got a name, a history to go with it, and it's of good quality, too. It'll fetch a fine price.
Linlang: ...Relax, I'm not going to ask how you got in there. I just do business. Other matters are none of my concern.
Linlang: All in all, I'd say this ring's worth *200,000 Mora*. What do you say?

### Talk 13 related talk 4

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Linlang: Impressive, wasn't it? Even in death, the gods pass in glory, unlike the surreptitious departure of mortals... I'm glad I was able to witness an event of such magnificence.
Linlang: It's just a shame that I couldn't have met him, or talked to him about my dreams...
Linlang: Ah, what I am saying? Sorry about that.

Linlang: I'm very sorry, but the shop is not open yet. If you want to browse the shop, please find me at Xigu Antiques later.
Traveler: Tell me about Xigu Antiques.
Linlang: A fellow antique collector, are you?
Linlang: In that case, I do hope you will come to the store tonight.
Linlang: Right now, though, I am taking my post-breakfast walk. Apologies.

Traveler: What are you doing?
Linlang: Oh, I'm just taking a stroll nearby to relax. I'd like to admire the scenery one more time before the sun sets.
Linlang: This land has remained at peace for a thousand years now. But sometimes, I wonder — how did the people who walked this land a thousand years ago feel?
Linlang: I cannot know, yes, but our Lord certainly does — Rex Lapis, who has gently watched over this land for a millennium...
Linlang: ...I wonder, has there been anyone at all who has been privy to his feelings across this long period?

Vlad: It's festival time here in Liyue again. Thanks for accepting my invitation to view the moon together...
Vlad: I'd originally planned to invite you to some famous restaurant, but I didn't think that they'd been fully booked ages ago...
Nadia: It's alright. I've heard that the theme of this festival is gourmet food. It's not all that surprising that there were no tables left.
Vlad: Eh? I—Is that so... So that's why I couldn't book any seats...
Vlad: Looks like my lack of understanding about Liyue was to blame. I'm sorry...
Nadia: Eh? Oh, no, you don't have to apologize...
Nadia: Just being able to relax and watch the bright moon together is good enough for me.
Nadia: Don't you think the moon at this time is brighter and rounder than usual?
Vlad: Oh, is it? ...No, I mean... You're right. It truly is very beautiful.

Changchang: I'm not scared though, everyone's really nice here and there's the Millelith to beat up all the bad guys!
Traveler: What're you playing now?

Huixin: Hello, welcome to the Moonchase Festival here in Liyue.
Huixin: The theme of this year's Moonchase Festival is gourmet food, and this iteration of Masterful Chefs is being organized by the Liyue Qixing themselves. With all the great chefs taking part, this is one show you don't want to miss!
Huixin: I hope that everyone will have a good time during the festival. Of course, if you do have civil affairs at hand, please direct your concerns to the Ministry.

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Huixin: Now that we've sent Rex Lapis off, we will never again receive his direction...
Huixin: ...That burden now falls upon the Qixing.
Huixin: But I don't fear for our future. Other than the Qixing, we do still have Ganyu. She'll do a great job supporting the Qixing, I'm sure of it!

### Talk 17 related talk 1

Traveler: I have some questions.
Huixin: Please, ask away! I will answer to the best of my ability.
Traveler: Tell me about Liyue.
Huixin: Oh? I take it that you are not from around here, then.
Huixin: Not that there's any problem with that, we do not exclude anybody here in Liyue! On the contrary, with this being a commercial port, people get nervous if they see a decline in the foreign population.
Huixin: Thanks to the guidance of Rex Lapis, Liyue has gone from strength to strength in the last thousand years.
Huixin: Our forebears discovered the craft of producing glazes via firing. Trade with foreign lands grew, and Liyue prospered.
Huixin: Our biggest point of pride is that Mora, the coins used as currency throughout Teyvat, are cast right here in Liyue at the Golden House. More importantly, Mora are named after Morax, which is Rex Lapis' original name.
Traveler: Tell me about the Qixing.
Huixin: You could say the Qixing are my bosses... Surely it doesn't count as workplace gossip if I'm just giving you their backstories? Haha...
Huixin: The Qixing — or "Seven Stars" — is a Liyue business committee. It is also used as a collective term for the seven business tycoons who sit on the committee and handle Liyue's government affairs.
Huixin: I trust you have heard of Ningguang, of the Jade Chamber? Like her, each Qixing is a major player in business circles whose every action has a profound influence.
Huixin: They are responsible for implementing the policy that comes down from Rex Lapis and making rulings on important matters. They are akin to the hands and feet of Rex Lapis.
Traveler: Could you tell me a bit more about the Qixing?
Huixin: Hmm, the Qixing do in fact have a clear internal division of labor.
Huixin: Besides Lady Ningguang, with whom you are familiar, the Yuheng, Lady Keqing, is in charge of land, construction works and the like.
Huixin: Liyue is very vast, and requires strict regulation and eminent developmental direction...
Huixin: The other esteemed members of the Qixing are also highly accomplished in their own fields. They are the pillars of the prosperity that Liyue enjoys today.
Traveler: Where are we right now?
Huixin: We are at Yuehai Pavilion. This is where the Qixing discuss official business and rule on major issues that affect the whole of Liyue.
Huixin: To serve the Qixing is to serve all of Liyue, so it is my honor to be working here.
Huixin: Sometimes I feel like the whole way I carry myself has become more dignified since I started working here. Hehehe.
Huixin: None of the big shots are here right now — presumably they're all busy with private business.

Musheng: Haha! It was the right call to come here during the festival. You just can't beat the festive cheer here in the city!
Musheng: I've heard that the Moonchase Festival used to be celebrated for very different reasons in the past. Something about the adepti's rituals, I believe.
Musheng: But I don't think that what it's about now — gathering together and admiring the moon — is half bad, either!
Musheng: I'm sure that the adepti, too, would be gladdened to see everyone enjoying themselves.

### Talk 18 related talk 0

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Musheng: How could a divinity like Rex Lapis die? Even though I witnessed it myself, I can't believe it.
Musheng: He must've just moved back to Celestia. I mean, many of his old adepti pals are still there, right?
Musheng: As for Liyue, I'm sure he's made thorough arrangements... Why, you ask?
Musheng: Well, I've lived in my hometown for several decades now, and I sure did miss home a few times while I was here for the Rite...
Musheng: Rex Lapis has been with us for thousands of years... I'm sure he'll miss us, too.

### Talk 18 related talk 1

Traveler: Who are you?
Musheng: I live in the countryside. I visit the city once a year at this time to burn incense as an offering to the Geo Lord.
Musheng: Everyone in Liyue is into things that bring good luck. I'm no different.
Musheng: Were it not for the Geo Lord's power, Liyue would not be as prosperous as it is today. That is why I come here every year to pay my respects at this temple, no matter how long the journey is and no matter what other pressing business there is to attend to.
Musheng: As the saying goes, "None shall learn what the immortals have in store for them until he first does that which is within his power as a mortal."
Traveler: About Rex Lapis' protection...
Musheng: Huh. Judging from your tone, you're not a believer, are you?
Musheng: Well, just a short while back, I was set upon by bandits on the road to Liyue Harbor. It was only by the intervention of a young hero named "Xingqiu of the Guhua Clan" that I was saved.
Musheng: This must have been the protection of Rex Lapis! He must have known that I was coming to offer incense, and thus stepped in to rescue me!
Musheng: Were it not for Rex Lapis' divine arrangement, how could a long-lost clan like Guhua suddenly return out of nowhere?
Musheng: However you want to put it, I thank Rex Lapis. I shall also offer incense on behalf of that young hero of the Guhua Clan. I will pray for his fortune and safety, as repayment for his deeds.

### Talk 18 related talk 2

Traveler: Goodbye.
Musheng: I will stay around in the city a bit longer. It will be more effective if I let the scent of incense permeate every inch of me...

Zhang Shun: Of course not, I'm a sailor with The Crux. They're the spoils of years of service.
Zhang Shun: But I got injured during the battle against Haishan. If it weren't for Captain Beidou, I'd be a goner.
Zhang Shun: So I decided it best I leave The Crux. Can't have a crewmate's old injury flaring up and dragging the crew under...
Zhang Shun: At least the things I collected over the years is enough to keep me going though.

Ivanovich: The Moonchase Festival really is a busy time. Looking at all the locals running about preparing food, I can't help but be tempted to try my hand at it myself.
Ivanovich: Do you think some Snezhnayan fare and some grilled pies and such would sell well?

### Talk 20 related talk 0

Traveler: Are you out of Cor Lapis too?
Ivanovich: Oh, I thought you were here to purchase Snezhnayan products.
Ivanovich: No, that I still have, although I ship it all to factories in Snezhnaya. I don't do retail.
Ivanovich: Too much hassle, not enough return. Sorry.
Traveler: Does "we'll take it all" still count as retail?
Ivanovich: Wha— Ah, no, no, no. Give me a second to think. Um...
Ivanovich: A—Alright, I'll do it. Just need you to sign for it.
Ivanovich: (Clearly no shortage of cashflow in Liyue...)
Traveler: So you're rejecting the Feiyun Commerce Guild's business?

### Talk 20 related talk 1

Traveler: Who are you...?
Ivanovich: I am Ivanovich, pleasure to meet you! I am a businessman from Snezhnaya. I am now waiting for my next delivery.
Ivanovich: The people of Liyue are very wealthy! I import goods from Snezhnaya and everything sells out almost as soon as it arrives.
Ivanovich: If I had known sooner, I would have opened my own store here so I could sell directly to consumers. That way I would not have to oversee the deliveries myself.

### Talk 20 related talk 2

Traveler: What do you sell?
Ivanovich: Technically I am a distributor, selling everyday items produced in Snezhnaya. As well as that, I also act as an agent for Cor Lapis merchants selling to Snezhnayan factories.
Ivanovich: The Qixing have been keeping a close eye on Snezhnaya's senior officials recently...
Ivanovich: Some people say that the only reason we are able to buy Cor Lapis from Liyue merchants is because they were mediating behind the scenes...
Ivanovich: But I am not privy to the details. So please excuse me from withholding judgment.
Ivanovich: Although our goods are produced in high quantities, they are by no means cheap.
Ivanovich: So I have a high opinion of Liyue consumers... Their spending always exceeds our projections.

## Talk 21

Traveler: About the Moonchase Festival...
Madame Ping: The meaning of the Festival in ages past was quite different. It was about the ancients of Liyue seeking the adeptal path.
Madame Ping: Nowadays, it's more about admiring the moon, eating, and enjoying our time together with one another.
Madame Ping: The meaning of festivals will shift with time, and some traditions will be forgotten. However, everyone's hopes for the future will remain the same, no matter what the day or age.
