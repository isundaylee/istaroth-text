# Talk Dialog

Kayabuki Ikkei: Hey, how's it going?
Traveler: About the novel you were writing...
Kayabuki Ikkei: I grew up reading storybooks and novels, and back then, I dreamed of becoming like Iwakura or Kitain, an unparalleled warrior and slayer of demons.
Kayabuki Ikkei: I only realized that I lacked that talent after I'd grown up. That's why I decided to write stories about warriors instead. The art of making lines of words shine is a martial art in and of itself, wouldn't you say?
Kayabuki Ikkei: I mean, I could've still have chosen to become an attach√© to some military officer, but I must say that I'd prefer penning the tale of a carefree outland warrior like yourself.
Kayabuki Ikkei: I've written your performance in the last Hyakunin Ikki down. The draft has been sent to the Yae Publishing House for review... Wonder how it's going...
Traveler: About what happened before...
Kayabuki Ikkei: Your performance in the last Hyakunin Ikki was fabulous!
Kayabuki Ikkei: Even Shousen, the master of Shinryuu, could have never imagined such a doughty martial artist like you...
Traveler: About the Hyakunin Ikki...
Kayabuki Ikkei: In the early days, this was a mysterious rite used by the Tengu-Kin as a means of making a ruckus.
Kayabuki Ikkei: Even after they were banned, people would still sometimes organize it in secret. The organizers' identities are still shrouded in mystery.
Kayabuki Ikkei: It's a rather rowdy brawl, all things considered. Anyone can participate, mortal or monster.
Kayabuki Ikkei: That's got to be a dream come true for those who long for battle, eh?
