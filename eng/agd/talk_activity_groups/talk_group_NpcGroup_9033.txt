Tartaglia: #It's been a while, Traveler.
Tartaglia: I've grown quite a bit stronger. You ready for some sparring?
Tartaglia: ...Haha, kidding! You're here because there's something you want to say, right?

## Talk

Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Tartaglia: It's the perfect place to make a home.
Tartaglia: Charming, peaceful... and warm.
Tartaglia: I'd love to bring Tonia, Anthon, and Teucer to stay here...
Traveler: I don't think this place can accommodate so many people...
Tartaglia: Hahaha, sorry, I didn't mean it like that.
Tartaglia: I just think that Tonia and the others would be very happy in your company.
Traveler: I'm not actually as good with kids as you think...

## Talk

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Tartaglia: Of course. I'm more than willing.
Tartaglia: In Snezhnaya, there's a kind of liquor called Fire-Water.
Tartaglia: If a friend will join you outside in the bitter cold to drink Fire-Water and chat together, you know they're the kind of person you want with you on the battlefield.
Tartaglia: I would join you for just such a conversation.
Tartaglia: And in the heat of battle, I know that you'd have my back.
Traveler: You're not afraid that I might backstab you?
Tartaglia: This is the level of trust I place in you.
Tartaglia: If you joined me on my path to world domination, we would be unstoppable.
Tartaglia: What do you say? Do you accept my proposal?
Traveler: What if I fall first?
Tartaglia: Hah, you lack conviction in your own abilities.

## Talk

Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Tartaglia: Hmm... When can you spare a few weeks?
Tartaglia: I want to take you to see the scenery of my homeland.
Tartaglia: To gaze upon the endless snowy sky, to stand on frozen lakes that won't shatter, no matter how hard you tread.
Tartaglia: Some people even carve gigantic ice sculptures there.
Tartaglia: If you like snowball fights, I'll pair with you and we can face off against my siblings.
Tartaglia: Oh, and I almost forgot! I can also make authentic Borsch for you with specialty ingredients from my hometown.
Tartaglia: ...And, of course, we have to go ice fishing! The fish are much larger than the ones you find in ponds.
Traveler: Sounds like a blast!
Tartaglia: Alright, it's settled then!
Tartaglia: Mmm, seems like I'll have to give my family a heads-up.
Tartaglia: I can see it now, the beaming smiles on their faces as they gather around and read the letter.
Traveler: Can't wait!

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Tartaglia.
Tartaglia: Good morning, comrade.
Tartaglia: If there's ever a battle that even you find a challenge, don't forget to call me.
Tartaglia: I'd appreciate the... exercise.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Tartaglia.
Tartaglia: It's already that time of the night, huh...
Tartaglia: #Good night, Traveler.
Tartaglia: Who knows when we'll meet next...

## Talk

Tartaglia: A kitchen? Haha, how intriguing! You know, I used to cook quite often. Let me show you a thing or two!
Tartaglia: The arts of cooking and war aren't so different. Tasting your opponent's dishes is also a form of battle.
Tartaglia: I wonder... dare you accept my challenge?

## Talk

Tartaglia: Ah, such a rich aroma truly makes you feel refreshed and alive.
Tartaglia: I've tasted dishes from both Liuli Pavilion and Xinyue Kiosk, but you can't fully appreciate a country's cuisines if you only stick to high-end restaurants.
Tartaglia: I leave it to you to bring me around and taste the local snacks and specialties, alright?
