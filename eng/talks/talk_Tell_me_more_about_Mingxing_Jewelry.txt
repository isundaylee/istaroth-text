Traveler: Tell me more about Mingxing Jewelry.
Xingxi: Mingxing Jewelry is a Liyue trader of precious stones and gems that has been around for hundreds of years.
Xingxi: You could say it is the Rex Lapis of the market for precious stones. It is the only store of its kind, and it has been in business continuously since the day it was founded.
Xingxi: Have you ever heard anyone mention our Lucent Crescent ornaments? They are especially popular with young people.

Xingxi: Interested? Heh... Whether what they say is true or not I don't know, but I do know that I, personally, would be won over if someone was to buy one for me...
