# Irate Iron Chunk


## Talk 1

Arabalika: A Nara... and something that flies?
Paimon: #Yeah, Paimon's Paimon, and Paimon can fly. Oh, and he's Traveler.
Paimon: You must be Arabalika. Speaking of which, you don't seem afraid of us at all.
Arabalika: Golden Nara has Arapandu's scent.
Paimon: Oh, well, Arapandu did actually ask us to come...
Arabalika: No malice. If you wanted to harm Arabalika, you would have attacked when the Big Iron Chunk was still moving.
Paimon: Ooh, yeah, that sure would've been what they call "hitting an Aranara when they're down"... Wait. Hold on, we wouldn't do anything like that.
Arabalika: Why not? If Arabalika was your enemy, attacking from both sides is a good tactic. Even animals do it when hunting.
Paimon: Hmm... You have a point.
Traveler: Getting confused, Paimon?
Paimon: ...Anyway! We definitely won't "hit an Aranara when they're down"!
Traveler: Aranara are our friends, after all.
Paimon: Yes, that's right! Aranara are our friends! We won't hurt our friends!
Arabalika: Hmph.
Paimon: Uhh... Why does he seem dissatisfied...
Traveler: Maybe you didn't leave a good first impression, Paimon.
Paimon: But Paimon doesn't think she did anything wrong... Urgh... Aranara have such strange tempers...
Paimon: Oh right, Arapandu said that Arabalika's Ararakalari is very powerful. He must have used his Ararakalari to defeat that Ruin Guard earlier!
Arabalika: Paimon knows about Ararakalari?
Paimon: ...Y—Yeah, of course Paimon knows! It's... It's that thing! That really, really powerful... ability!
Arabalika: Hmph.
Paimon: Woah! Paimon feels like he's looking down on Paimon again...
Traveler: Let's focus on the task at hand.
Paimon: Yeah... We're here to help heal the Varuna Contraption! We should be able to find a branch and some leaves here too, right? Why doesn't Paimon see them?
Arabalika: What branch? What leaves? They are more like roots.
Paimon: Really? Is that true? But Arapandu said...
Arabalika: The Varuna Contraption gets power from the root system spread throughout Vana.
Paimon: Oh... That kinda makes sense...
Arabalika: And the roots are underground.
Arabalika: The Stone and Iron Chunks here do not belong to Aranara. To go down, we must defeat Iron Chunks. Iron Chunks are very strong. But Golden Nara is also not weak.
Paimon: #Of course! Traveler has defeated countless Big Iron Chunks already.
Arabalika: Oh? Then Arabalika wants to see how strong Nara is!
Paimon: Huh!? Why did he burrow underground... Oh! Could he have already gone to the Ruin Guard?
Paimon: #Traveler, let's follow him!
Traveler: Maybe he's like this to everyone.
Paimon: How's this possible? How can he look so cute but have such a horrible temper...

## Talk 2

Arabalika: Hmph. Arabalika admits you have some skills.
Paimon: He praised us! Hehe.
Arabalika: We can prepare to go underground now. Follow me.
Paimon: Okay, let's follow Arabalika quickly.

## Talk 3

Arabalika: We've defeated the Big Iron Chunk. Follow the water. We will go under the ground.
Arabalika: Arabalika has not been here for a long time. Everything has changed. Maybe there are also Big Iron Chunks under the ground. Arabalika smells iron. Bad smell. Be careful.
Arabalika: #Nara Traveler is strong. No need to fear. But Paimon is like Aranakula. Weak. Be careful. Mushroom might eat you.
Paimon: Urgh... Anyone would look weak compared to you, okay? We met many Aranara before, but Paimon doesn't think any of them can defeat a Ruin Guard with one blow...
Arabalika: Paimon knows too little about Aranara. Aradasha would defeat a Big Iron Chunk before you could blink.
Arabalika: Aradasha's Ararakalari was very powerful in the past.
Paimon: In the past? What about now?
Arabalika: Now? Aradasha is not in the "now." That's why Arabalika must train even harder. Train Ararakalari.
Paimon: Paimon wishes she could learn how to use Ararakalari too...
Traveler: If you could, Paimon, I'd leave every battle to you.
Paimon: #Hehe, and Paimon would protect Traveler instead!
Traveler: I'm counting on you, Paimon!
Paimon: Leave it to Paimon! You can leave everything to Paimon!
Arabalika: Paimon loves to dream. A good thing? A bad thing? Can't tell. But we need to look for a stone device. Make water go away. We cannot go underground otherwise.
Arabalika: Aranara can dig into the soil, but not water.
Paimon: #Okay, Traveler, let's have a look around!
Traveler: Paimon won't be able to learn it.
Paimon: Paimon can if Paimon tries!
Traveler: Most people who say that are...
Paimon: Should Paimon ask Arabalika to teach Paimon after we eat and rest in a safe place?

## Talk 4

Paimon: They seem... they seem broken! They aren't moving at all! Whew. Th—That really gave Paimon a fright back there.
Paimon: Hehehe! So, it's just a bunch of rusty Iron Chunks, eh?
Arabalika: Careless Paimon. Vana is dangerous now. You will get in trouble.
Paimon: Mm... Arabalika is so strict.
Traveler: You're just too careless, Paimon.
Paimon: Is that true? Well... If Paimon's as strict as Arabalika, will Paimon be as strong as him?
Traveler: Paimon, you should be stricter on yourself and not to others.
Paimon: Okay, then Paimon'll have strict requirements for herself... starting tomorrow!
Paimon: Anyway, since the stone branch is here, now we need to...
Arabalika: We need to make three other rocks face it.
Paimon: H—He took the words out of Paimon's mouth...
Paimon: Speaking of which, Arabalika doesn't talk like the other Aranara. He doesn't use metaphors at all.
Traveler: It's easier to understand though.
Paimon: It really is more direct and easier to understand!
Arabalika: Arapandu thinks a lot. Arabalika doesn't think much. Arabalika only knows how to protect.
Arabalika: Arapandu once protected Vana with Nara Varuna. They drove away the unknown black mud. Healed the Varuna Contraption.
Arabalika: #It has been a long time since Nara Varuna left Vana. Maybe {F#he}{M#she} won't come to Festival Utsava anymore.
Arabalika: Arapandu must know. It has been so many years since then. Enough time for a small seed to grow into a towering tree. Nara who leave Vana will never return.
Arabalika: But Arapandu wants to heal the Varuna Contraption again. For Vana. For Festival Utsava. For Nara Varuna.
Paimon: Paimon gets it...
Arabalika: #Arabalika never met Nara Varuna, but {F#his}{M#her} story is remembered by Vana.
Arabalika: Arabalika doesn't think as much as Arapandu. Arabalika only knows that he must become strong to protect Aranara and Vana.
Arabalika: Nara Varuna is no longer here, but Aranara can still heal the Varuna Contraption.
Paimon: Yup! We'll help out too!
Arabalika: #Something is wrong with the smell of iron. Nara Traveler, Arabalika will leave this to you. Will wait here.
Paimon: Paimon doesn't know what you sensed, Arabalika... But oh well. Paimon's sure you know more about the forest than us!
Paimon: #Anyway, Traveler, let's start looking around here for the three scattered leaves.
Traveler: It makes him seem less like an Aranara...
Paimon: Well, what would be "more like an Aranara" anyway? Oh well, Paimon doesn't get it.

## Talk 5

Arabalika: Smells of too much iron. Not good.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Phew... That was scary! It's a good thing that Arabalika helped out.
Arabalika: Arabalika told you so. Paimon is careless. Will get in trouble.
Paimon: Alright, alright... Paimon's got it...
Traveler: Ruin Guards are here to do their job too, you know.
Paimon: Yeah, guards should be guarding something against trespassers. After all, we're outsiders to them.
Arabalika: #Nara Traveler and Paimon are outsiders to Vana. Not Arabalika. The Huge Iron Chunk is making no sense.
Arabalika: Arabalika will teach it sense.
Paimon: Woah... Um, Paimon will become more sensible in the future!
Traveler: I'll hold you to your word, Paimon.
Paimon: Of course! Tomorrow... No, starting from now!
Arabalika: #Only Aranara can awaken the stone here. Leave the rest to Arabalika, Nara Traveler and Paimon.
Paimon: Ooooh!
Paimon: We're one step closer to healing the Varuna Contraption! Once it is healed, there won't be so many spores in Apam Woods anymore... Just thinking about it makes Paimon's nose itch...
Arabalika: The Varuna Contraption will purify rainwater. There will not be black rain or so many spores.
Arabalika: But there should still be mushrooms. Be careful, Paimon. You might get eaten by them. Like Aranakula.
Paimon: Yes... Paimon'll be careful!
Arabalika: #Arabalika no longer needed here. Arabalika will return to the "rest stop" to look for Arapandu. Nara Traveler and Paimon, will you return with Arabalika?
Traveler: Let's go together.
Arabalika: Yes. It is dangerous in Vana. Traveling together is safer.
Traveler: I have something else to do.
Arabalika: #Be careful, Nara Traveler and Paimon. Don't be careless. May Aramuhukunda watch over you.
