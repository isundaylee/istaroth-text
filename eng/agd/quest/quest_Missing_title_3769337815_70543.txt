Razor: ...
Dustball: ...Meow.
Razor: ...It's you. Me, I'm talking.
Paimon: Talking... Razor, are you talking to Dustball?
Dustball: Meow, meow-meow.
Paimon: It seems like Dustball is trying to say... "That's right"?
Razor: A familiar scent, looking for friends.
Razor: It is good. Happy.
Dustball: Meow, meow.
Razor: Friends followed the scent. You came too, happy. On your body, the smell of wind and rain, very familiar... The scent of cats, also familiar.
Razor: Paimon, very sweet scent. Smell good.
Paimon: Eh!? Sweet... Could that be the flavor of the pancakes Valerina gave us? Dâ€”Did Paimon eat that many?
Traveler: I gave you half of my portion, remember?
Paimon: Really? Paimon didn't even notice... Mmm, it's all the pancake's fault for being so delicious!
Paimon: Hehe, and Paimon also wants to eat Sweet Madames, Steaks, and Hash Browns... oh, and drink some Apple Cider!
Paimon: #Okay, that's the menu for the next meal then! C'mon, Traveler, let's go place our order with Valerina! You come too, Razor!
Razor: Thank... Thank you...
Razor: Dustball has brought me lots of... nuts...
Razor: And, meat boxes... I am very full.
Paimon: Sounds like Valerina ordered delivery, then? Did Dustball deliver the food to you, Razor?
Dustball: Meow-meow. Meow!
Paimon: Paimon never imagined that the cats would actually end up taking care of the customers here in the Furball Fortress!
Paimon: Looks like you really are the cat's meow, eh, Razor?
Traveler: No sweat, you can still eat triple what you ate before.
