# Talk Dialog

Traveler: You seem a little down.
Isadora: Heh... I'm not sure I'd say that, but at the same time, it's been a while since I last considered myself happy.
Isadora: I'm an auditor here at the Palais. My work is confidential, so I can't really unburden myself of my complaints to anyone.
Isadora: Of course, I fully intend to follow the rules, but sometimes I really do wish I had someone to talk to.
Isadora: Maybe I need to take a different approach â€” learn to live with those things that don't go smoothly.
