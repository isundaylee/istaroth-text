Traveler: Could you tell me about the "prophecy"?
Galathee: Although there have been instances of rising water levels in our history, I'm inclined to focus on my current life and what I'll do before the prophecy comes to pass.
Galathee: I mean, everyone must return to their home and set their feet on solid ground one day, after having departed on countless voyages.
Galathee: As for distant dangers like prophecies, I think it's best left to long-lived beings such as deities.
