Traveler: What are you buying?
Arshia: Nothing special, just some daily necessities.
Arshia: I live in Aaru Village near the desert. It does have a sufficient supply of underground water, but other supplies are not that sufficient, so I regularly travel to Caravan Ribat to purchase daily necessities.
Arshia: This place is close to the desert and packed with merchants, so it's convenient to buy just about anything here.
