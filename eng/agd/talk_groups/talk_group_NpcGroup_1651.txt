Gentle Voice: Are you the... spring fairy?
Gentle Voice: Yes... that's me.
Gentle Voice: But I must apologize. I don't have the power to grant wishes, or anything of that nature. Sorry to disappoint.
Gentle Voice: The most I can do is turn water into wine, make all drinks taste delicious, do a little bit of healing... that sort of thing.
Gentle Voice: Also... I do apologize that for now I can only talk to you from within the water.

Gentle Voice: Tell me about Old Finch.
Gentle Voice: Oh... Finch has grown old, has he...
Gentle Voice: When I first arrived here from Fontaine, he was still a little crybaby.
Gentle Voice: But as his teardrops mingled with the spring water, I sensed his good and gentle nature.
Gentle Voice: He was the first friend I made in Mondstadt...
Gentle Voice: Why won't you see him anymore?
Gentle Voice: My kind lives long lives... very long lives...
Gentle Voice: But not so for humans...
Gentle Voice: If there must be a painful parting, better that it happen earlier, to avoid the deep lake of grief... better that it be but a droplet, whisked away by the surging river of time, then lost in the vast ocean of memory...
Gentle Voice: Forgive me... I just couldn't face it, I... I'm sorry...
Gentle Voice: Do you have any other friends?
Gentle Voice: Yes, I made friends with a hunter's daughter once.
Gentle Voice: When I saw how adorable she was, and her love for her father, an urge to pour out my blessings upon her welled up inside of me...
Gentle Voice: But then she grew older and more mature. I haven't appeared to her since.
Gentle Voice: I'm sure she just thinks of me as her imaginary childhood friend, now...
