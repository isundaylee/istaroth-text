Traveler: Who are you, again?
Loumelat: I'm Loumelat bint Atif Abu Rashid, a fisher here in Sumeru.
Loumelat: I might be good at fishing, but I was actually born in the desert. There are oases out there, sure, but we hardly ever see any fish. I didn't even know what a fish was when I was a kid.
Loumelat: It was not until I came to the harbor that I realized I was so good at fishing. I could earn in one year what other people make in three!
Loumelat: I doubt it'll be long now before I can bring my parents here to live with me. Haha, this is my Rashid!
