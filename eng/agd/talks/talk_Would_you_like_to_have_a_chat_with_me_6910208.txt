# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Mualani: Couldn't have picked a better moment! I just got back â€” took a walk around the place and then had a chat with Tubby. But now, I'm all yours!
Traveler: I see you're getting along nicely!
Mualani: Well, you gotta make an effort when you go somewhere new. I always like taking walks and talking to the locals...
Mualani: So, how about you? I'm curious, what do you do to try and fit in when you arrive someplace new?
Traveler: I make detailed travel plans ahead of time.
Mualani: Huh... Sounds very meticulous. So I guess you're the kind of tourist who never misses out on a single highlight, huh?
Mualani: You probably explore every village, walk down every last street, try all the best dishes on all the good menus, tick every scenic spot off the list...
Mualani: I can just imagine it... Ah, traveling with you would be so fulfilling!
Mualani: Alright! I'll keep your preferences in mind for the next time we travel together!
Mualani: It'll be a journey into the unknown... Ah, I can't wait!
Traveler: Would you still look forward to visiting places you've already been to?
Mualani: Of course!
Mualani: Most tourists who come to our tribal land on vacation stick to the popular routes, so I've gone over those countless times.
Mualani: I could literally navigate them with my eyes closed if I wanted. Not even exaggerating.
Mualani: But I never would. Because even when it's a road I've been down before, each time I go, it's a new journey.
Mualani: All kinds of things make each trip unique, whether it's the clouds in the sky, the ever-changing weather, the wildflowers by the side of the road... or all the wild animals that give you a fright when they jump out of nowhere...
Mualani: And that's not getting to visitors suddenly changing their plans and heading off the beaten path into some tiny, winding trail... Hmm...
Traveler: Now that's what you call a tough customer!
Mualani: Hmm? Oh, no, I wasn't complaining. I actually don't mind at all.
Mualani: Just the opposite, in fact. More twists and turns means a more varied and scenic route, so it's no loss at all! Hehe...
Traveler: Should've expected that from you! So next time, we'll also take the road-less-traveled!
Mualani: Uh... Sure, I guess?
Mualani: I'll gladly go wherever you want! But remember, if you ever get sick of walking everywhere...
Mualani: Just hop onto my surfboard!
Traveler: I take things as they come. Comfort comes first.
Mualani: Same! I approve, two thumbs up from me! And two big toes as well.
Mualani: I dunno about you, but for me, a big part of taking things as they come is... not necessarily being a morning person. Haha...
Mualani: Sometimes it's nice to just explore without a set goal, see where the journey takes you. Of course, that can lead to nice and nasty surprises, but... I guess that's all part of the fun!
