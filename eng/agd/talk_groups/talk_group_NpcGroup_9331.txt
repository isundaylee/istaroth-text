Yanfei: This place is so quiet! It's a perfect place to brush up on my legal research and organize my notes.
Yanfei: #Hey, Traveler, do you still remember those clauses I discussed with you once before?
Yanfei: You've already forgotten? Well, you'll just have to recite them over and over until you know them by heart.

Yanfei: If you think about it, you could define a "challenge" as a process that's difficult to get control over due to a lack of key information. Right?
Yanfei: Example: What foes are we likely to encounter when exploring this domain? How many hostile encounters are likely to occur? And what available countermeasures can we use?
Yanfei: Take the time to thoroughly consider all these questions. Then you'll find that reaching your goal is no longer a "challenge" at all.

Yanfei: Do you think that the way fairytales end is just whimsical? Or do you think the writers put a lot of thought into it?
Yanfei: Because if you read them from the point of view of trying to identify what each character symbolically represents, you find a lot of very deep metaphors.
Yanfei: Still, in order to verify my hypothesis and see if it stands up to scrutiny, I need to do some historical and cultural research... Maybe I could borrow some of these materials here so I can do a deep-dive later.
