Traveler: A jadeworker?
Deyin: Hah! When I was young, I was one of the best jade artisans in Chenyu Vale.
Deyin: There's always an inextricable connection between beautiful jade and fascinating stories.

Deyin: Nowadays, I occasionally give my disciple some of my jade works to sell on my behalf.
Deyin: If you go to Yilong Wharf, you can visit my disciple's store. Maybe you'll come away with jadeware piece that tickles your fancy.

Traveler: From before?
Deyin: Recently, a youth has been coming to the teahouse, telling of the most humdrum happenings in the streets, thinking to please the public.
Deyin: A joke about a Fontainian who made a fool of themselves while drinking tea here, a story about a Mondstadter who was knocked out after drinking three bowls of a local spirit there...
Deyin: While it's true that outsiders don't understand our traditions and do many outlandish things, it's better to only discuss such things over a cup of tea or after meals.

Traveler: As long as tempers have cooled off, and everyone's feeling happier.
Deyin: I'm not angry at all. I just feel like it's a shame.
Deyin: Yilong Wharf's a real riot compared to Qiaoying Village, so I get why travelers restlessly spoil for some fun while passing through.
Deyin: However, at the end of the day, Chenyu Vale has Adeptus Fujin and our thousands of ancestors who endured great hardships to lay foundations down for us, so that there might be endless stories worth telling.
Deyin: As such, a mixture of mundane matters and elegant tales of the past should be told on stage.
Deyin: I wonder when that youth will understand...
