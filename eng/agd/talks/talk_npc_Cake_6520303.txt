Traveler: Cake?
Lanoire: Oh, I was just wondering what flavor of cake I should make for Cater's birthday!
Lanoire: ...Because now that I think about it, Cater always gives me food, but I don't know what he likes to eat.
Lanoire: Does he like Bulle Fruit? Or Sunsettia? Actually, since he's that color, maybe he likes Mint?
Lanoire: #But, more importantly, I've gotta find Cater. Wait for me to grow up, Mr. Traveler, and we'll go look for him together.
