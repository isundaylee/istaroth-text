Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Is there anything you'd like to do?</color>
Sucrose: Oh, actually... I have a few small questions I'd like to ask you.
Sucrose: Just say the first answer that comes to mind. There are no right or wrong answers.
Sucrose: Small Lamp Grass or Windwheel Aster?
Traveler: Small Lamp Grass.
Sucrose: Anemogranum or Anemo Crystalfly?
Traveler: Anemogranum.
Sucrose: A sea of clouds or a field of flowers?
Traveler: Sea of clouds.
Sucrose: Okay, I've noted your responses.
Sucrose: ...Previously, I never really knew how to bring this up.
Sucrose: I thought about inviting you to my private paradise... but currently, I still lack the ability to make it a reality.
Sucrose: So, for now... all I can do is place your selected objects into this crystal ball.
Sucrose: It will keep them safe until the day comes when they can adorn our very own paradise.
Traveler: It's a deal!
Sucrose: ...Alright, it's a deal.
Traveler: You should bring some of your favorite things, too.
Sucrose: Mm-hmm... I'll get there, one day!
Traveler: Field of flowers.
Traveler: Anemo Crystalfly.
Traveler: Windwheel Aster.
