Traveler: The sea's call?
Obata: Yeah! Do you hear it? The sound of the waves crashing against the beaches, the sound of fishes swimming through the waves...
Obata: Eh? You still don't get it?
Obata: ...Hahahaha, you must be an outlander. That's to be expected!
Obata: Here, I'll give you some of my catch. After you live by the ocean for a while, you'll start to understand the romantic nature of the sea!
