Traveler: The Nagarjunites?
Darya: The Nagarjunites were a branch of the Akademiya from long ago.
Darya: They were said to advocate strange ideals like "the transmission of knowledge at all costs" and "conflict is the natural order of Teyvat."
Darya: In short, this school of thought has long broken away from the rest of the Akademiya. They're no longer on the same branch.
Darya: Although they still seem to exist deep in the desert, most people have either never heard of them, or have, but consider them a myth.
Darya: I'm just being angry, so don't take it too seriously. I believe that sooner or later the Akademiya will take the future of our children seriously...
