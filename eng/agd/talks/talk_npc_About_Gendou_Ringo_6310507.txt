Traveler: About Gendou Ringo...
Inagi Hotomi: Ah yes. I do believe that people have been saying that her attitude's gotten a lot better recently.
Inagi Hotomi: Although rather than calling it an attitude adjustment, it might be more accurate to say that "she seems like a different person," no?
Traveler: ...
Inagi Hotomi: Haha. Not to worry, everyone at the shrine already knew, more or less.
Inagi Hotomi: Although I'm not privy to the details, if Lady Yae has allowed her to stay at the shrine, then she is someone we can trust.
