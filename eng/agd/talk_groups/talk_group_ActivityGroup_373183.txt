Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): ...In the realm appears a returning traveler, amidst the clouds, an old friend I encounter...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Hmm, no, no. These two lines lack a pleasing form, and the meter doesn't quite fit...
Traveler: Are you writing poetry?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): You flatter me. These are barely poetry.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): It's just that I couldn't help but say a few words to express my feelings upon seeing the breathtaking beauty of this abode.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): It's a shame that I have no talent for poetry. This is the best I can do.
Traveler: I've never met statues that talk as much as you lot...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): That's for sure. If it weren't for the spark of intellect within the jade, we wouldn't be able to speak at all.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Unfortunately, such jade is hard to find these days, and most gemstones in the world lack that intelligence...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): No amount of effort spent would create another being like us.
Traveler: You're exaggerating, surely? I've seen plenty of good jade.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Hehe. Mere "good jade" would succeed in imitating our shape, no doubt...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): But such an item would be a long way off from possessing speech.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): You'd need... Um, pardon me. I have little skill in crafting, so answering your question is, in truth, beyond my capabilities.
Traveler: So what are you skilled in exactly?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Uh... Many previous visitors have praised me for being understanding and eloquent.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Many of them poured their hearts out to me, and I tried my best to comfort them.
Traveler: Sâ€”So you are skilled at listening to others...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Exactly. Well... Unfortunately, those guests also liked to pat my head and ears to express their gratitude when leaving...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): That has caused the paint on my head and ears to wear out over time and require frequent touch-ups. That said, I don't have to worry about this issue anymore.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): ...You won't get into the habit of patting my head and ears, will you?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): It's impossible to find artisans capable of touching my paint up these days, so please do refrain from patting me...
Traveler: What would we need apart from jade?
