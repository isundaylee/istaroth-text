Manua: None of the plans today are too impractical.

## Talk

Traveler: Greetings.
Manua: Hello, hello. I am Manua, the assistant to our chief. Hopefully she hasn't caused you any trouble...
Manua: Don't get me wrong, Amina is very reliable, and she's learned much in the ways of managing the tribe from her grandfather. I have only the fullest of faith in her potential.
Manua: But she is still young, and children are bound to miss some details from time to time, so please bear with her.

## Talk

Traveler: What plans do you speak of?
Manua: Ah, it's Miss Amina's entertainment facilities renovation plan.
Manua: Do you find it strange that the chief would bring her plans to me?
Manua: Heh, it's because I'm her assistant.
Manua: Amina is very bright and constantly comes up with innovative ideas, like building a water coaster or hosting a kayaking tournament.
Manua: If you ask me, I think she just wants to ride in a water coaster herself, haha. But her ideas have all been very popular with tourists, so we should support her as best as we can.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Manua: See ya. I hope you'll have a good time at the tribe.

## Talk

Traveler: What plans do you speak of?
Manua: Ah, it's Miss Amina's battle preparation and defense facilities renovation plan, as well as her personnel deployment plan.
Manua: Do you find it strange that the chief would bring her plans to me?
Manua: Heh, it's because I'm her assistant.
Manua: Amina is very bright and always used to come up with all sorts of innovative ideas... albeit mostly entertainment facilities she wanted to try out herself.
Manua: The Abyssal incursions have grown worse lately, and I've noticed that her appetite for fun has decreased considerably. Though we People of the Springs have emerged relatively unscathed, there are always others who need our help.
