## Talk 1

Jala: Oh, how relaxing! The forests of Mondstadt are indeed a great place for camping! This business trip is so worth it!
Jala: The humidity and temperature are just perfect, so my clothes won't get drenched in sweat whenever I try to do a bit of work. The sunlight is not too glaring, and there's even a nice fragrance in the air!

## Talk 2

Porthos: Oh, Honorary Knight and The Helper in White, you are truly impressive, capturing the fugitive just like that!
Porthos: When my colleague and I first identified her as a suspect, after we confirmed her identity and time of departure, we mistakenly predicted she had fled in the direction of Dornman Port... We were just about to go after her on a ship...
Porthos: We didn't expect her to be hiding deep inside the Brightcrown Mountains. No wonder we couldn't track her down... She sure has some excellent counter-surveillance skills!
Paimon: Uh... Paimon doesn't think she tried to evade you at all... She didn't even know what happened...
Paimon: Nevertheless, Jala did make a big mistake, but she never meant for any of it to happen. Please don't be too harsh on her!
Porthos: Of course! I heard she's been quite cooperative. When criminals are cooperative, we will also be calm and rational when dealing with them.
Porthos: The investigation team reports that the current situation can be managed. We just need to go through the standard procedures, assess the damages, and then fine her accordingly.
Traveler: That'll be enough punishment.
Paimon: Whew... Didn't think we would take part in this incident... So this is what it feels like to capture a criminal as a knight!
Paimon: Anyway, it's a relief that Jala was just careless and not trying to sabotage Mondstadt's wine industry...
Paimon: If we had caught a vicious, super noisy criminal who had no remorse, it would really have spoiled our good mood!
Paimon: Paimon hopes Jala has learned her lesson and won't be too upset about her punishment...
Traveler: She's not a bad person, after all.

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: You are?
Jala: Oh! New friends! Please, sit! Have some tea, let's eat and chat together!
Jala: I'm Jala. I'm a merchant from Sumeru. I just closed a big deal, and right now, I'm enjoying the natural beauty of Mondstadt!
Paimon: It's the first time we've met someone camping in this area...
Paimon: Shouldn't a merchant be... guarding their shop and cargo? If you hadn't told us, we would never have guessed what you are!
Jala: Oh, merchants are people too, we also need rest. Who doesn't have a few hobbies? Work-life balance, you know, work-life balance...
Jala: You know, back in Sumeru, even students tormented by their studies all the time value this. They even invent games to help themselves relax!
Jala: I earned my first big haul by distributing a tabletop game invented by a student, called Shroomsplosion!
Jala: That genius student once said, "There's always more work. One must learn to take some time to... take a break~".
Jala: She brought me wealth beyond my wildest imagination, so I took her words as my motto! Sure enough, I live happily every day!
Traveler: That name sounds oddly familiar...
Paimon: Jâ€”Jala! Can you tell us more about how you came to distribute that "Shroomsplosion" game?
Jala: Huh? You've also heard of it? It's already a really old game... Was it years or over a decade ago? Oh, how time flies...
Jala: It was quite a coincidence, really. At the time, she was going to return to her homeland, so she sold everything she couldn't bring with her, including the game's pieces and board.
Jala: Back then I bought and sold junk and secondhand goods. When I had the fortune to run into her, I asked her about the pieces, and it reminded her that the game she invented may still be of some use... So she briefly walked me through it...
Jala: She said, if I was willing, I could try to keep the game running. I made a few copies, and they sold really well! My income just boom! Exploded upward!
Jala: Though Shroomsplosion didn't stay popular for long and was replaced by other similar games, it did earn me enough capital to start a real business. I no longer had to rely on selling junk to make a living.
Jala: You could say that the unintentional act of a student genius changed my life!
Traveler: Could it really be a coincidence!?
Paimon: Now that Paimon thinks about it, it does seem like something she would do... Perhaps she actually invented quite a few games, and "Shroomsplosion" just wasn't that important to her?
Paimon: Or, in terms of business, she probably felt managing the rights of the games was really troublesome... She probably couldn't be bothered with it and felt her time worth more than the Mora she'd earn.
Jala: Right? Don't you think it was amazing?
Jala: Later, I heard that her home was Mondstadt, and since then, Mondstadt has become one of my favorite places to go!
Jala: So, for many years, I've been trying to find the chance to finally come to Mondstadt to do business and see what the culture and people are like for myself!
Jala: I have to say, it didn't disappoint! I closed a big deal and had a great time here!
Jala: I sincerely suggest you trying it for yourselves. Find a good work-life balance, and give your life a comfortable rhythm!
Traveler: Just giving away her creation like that!?
Traveler: The student you're talking about wouldn't happen to be...

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: Business?
Jala: Oh? You're locals? Want to join me for a cup of soup or some food?
Paimon: How hospitable! Are you a... camping enthusiast?
Jala: Ha! Well, you wouldn't be completely wrong to say that! I'm Jala, a merchant from Sumeru. Perhaps you'll become familiar with my name soon.
Jala: Once I get approval, you'll be able to purchase my goods from Miss Blanche! I offer unique Sumeru ingredients, spices, and tableware, all at a fair price!
Jala: I have to say, Mondstadters are so amicable. We reached an agreement really fast without much haggling!
Jala: Not that the people in Sumeru are bad-tempered... We just tend to care more about details... and would spend quite a long time negotiating prices for bulk orders...
Traveler: There must be straight-forward people in Sumeru, too!
Paimon: Yeah. There are all kinds of people everywhere! You can't generalize about people like that!
Paimon: Maybe your past business deals didn't go so smoothly because of bad luck. But this time in Mondstadt, maybe you just got lucky?
Jala: Got lucky?
Jala: Right! When I first got to Mondstadt, I released a few fish for luck... That must be what brought me luck and led me to my ideal business partner!
Paimon: You released... a few fish?
Jala: That's right! Since it feels like we are bound by destiny, let me tell you a secret I learned from merchants in Fontaine that only a few people from Sumeru know...
Jala: Before doing something important, release some animals into the wild. It will bring you good fortune! Some even buy animals just to release them!
Jala: If you are hunters or something like that, you can consider doing it too! You lose a few Mora in exchange for lots of good luck! It's really a good deal!
Paimon: #(Hey, Traveler... The sudden appearance of Anglers in Cider Lake... Do you think it's because of...)
Traveler: (This merchant is the culprit...)
Paimon: (She's completely oblivious to the mess she made... So? Should we tell her? After all, it's already gotten really serious!)
Paimon: (Or should we just arrest her on the spot and let the Knights of Favonius decide her fate?)
Paimon: (Hm... Such a difficult decision! It feels like she's a warm-hearted person, and she was just trying to be hospitable to us... Turning on her now makes it feel like we're the bad guys here...)
Traveler: (How careless could she be...)
Traveler: There must be business-savvy Mondstadters, too!

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: (She's enjoying her leisure time. Let's not disturb her...)
Paimon: (Good point. People who make camp in secluded places like this prefer their privacy... Let's just leave.)

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: (As an Honorary Knight, I cannot stand idly by!)
Paimon: Then... Sorry, but we have no choice, Miss Jala!
Paimon: Please understand, as you've unintentionally caused significant damage and violated the laws of Mondstadt... We have no choice but to do this!
Jala: Huh? What are you talking about?
Jala: Wait... Why are you getting ready for a fight... Are you going hunting?
Jala: No need! No need at all! I still have lots of food here...
Jala: Waaaaaah!

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: (I really don't want to arrogate the authority to myself...)
Paimon: (Arrogate? What's with that weird term, all of a sudden? Paimon thinks she's heard it before somewhere...)
Paimon: (Do you mean, arresting suspects is a responsibility of other knights? We cannot do some other knight's job... and steal the credit?)
Paimon: (Hmm... It does make sense! Although Jala committed a crime, she doesn't seem like a bad person... Even a regular knight could apprehend her easily.)
Paimon: (For regular knights, this is an opportunity to acquire some easy merit. It really doesn't matter to us. We should just let them take care of it...)
Paimon: (But Jala is in a very secluded location. The knights might not be able to locate her easily... We have to get Jala back to Mondstadt somehow.)
Jala: What are you whispering about? Are you also interested in the theory behind releasing animals for luck?
Paimon: Oh! We... We heard you talking about fish, so we're wondering what we should have for dinner!
Traveler: I find myself suddenly craving some grilled fish.
Paimon: Huh? Hm... Oh! Right, right, right!
Paimon: Since you are here in Mondstadt, you gotta try Mondstadt Grilled Fish! It's so fragrant and convenient! Oh, and also Sticky Honey Roast, "Pile 'Em Up," and Flaming Red Bolognese!
Jala: Oh! You just reminded me of something!
Jala: I was so focused on my business deal and taking a scenic tour of Mondstadt that I completely forgot to enjoy some nice local specialties!
Jala: I heard there's a restaurant called Good Hunter in Mondstadt that offers great food at a good price and even provides delivery services! So I placed a few days' worth of orders without giving it much thought...
Jala: But I forgot to ask about local specialties at that time, and the deliveryperson may not be able to find where I set up camp...
Paimon: Say, why not just go back to Mondstadt and enjoy a good meal?
Jala: Right! I'll also ask the locals about other Mondstadt specialties to take back with me as souvenirs for my friends!
Jala: If I remember correctly, there are two knights stationed by the gates. They should be quite knowledgeable of Mondstadt and could give me some good recommendations!
Jala: You know what? I'm going back right now!
Black Screen Text: Jala leaves the campsite with enthusiasm, heading back toward Mondstadt.
Paimon: Jala even suggested talking to the knights herself... Paimon wonders if she'll get arrested on the spot...
Paimon: But perhaps the knights will understand that her actions were unintentional... No one who deliberately caused trouble would willingly come to talk to the knights, right?
Traveler: Jala likely won't be punished severely.
Paimon: Yeah! Paimon still feels bad about this, but people have to take responsiblity for their mistakes!
Paimon: Paimon only hopes Jala realizes her mistake soon and won't get too upset after being punished...
Traveler: We solved the problem peacefully.
Traveler: Have you ever had Mondstadt Grilled Fish?
