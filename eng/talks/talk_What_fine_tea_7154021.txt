# Talk Dialog

Zhongli: What fine tea...
Traveler: Zhongli, this gift envelope is for you.
Zhongli: Thank you. You're here at the perfect time — Director Hu brought me a pack of premium, aged "Iron Vermillion." It just finished steeping.
Traveler: Thank you for the hint earlier.
Zhongli: Hah, your thanks are unnecessary — it was your sharpness of mind that put it to good use.
Zhongli: Many deserve thanks on this occasion — Director Hu for her steadfastness, the Ministry of Civil Affairs for their leadership...
Zhongli: As a consultant, all I did was help Director Hu prepare a few gift envelopes and fortune coins.
Zhongli: Not to mention, we have you to thank for Director Hu's safe return. So, if anyone is to offer thanks, that person should be me.
Traveler: Huh? Is that how it is?
Zhongli: #The tea is ready, Traveler. Please, have the first cup and indulge me with stories about your recent endeavors.
Traveler: How did you... make this about me?
Traveler: See you.
Zhongli: May you have a blessed Lantern Rite. Take care!
