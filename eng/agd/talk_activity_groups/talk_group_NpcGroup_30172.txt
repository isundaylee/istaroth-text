## Talk

Ootomo: I leave the matter of the pictures to you. I am fortunate indeed to have met people of such fine artistic tastes as you and Lenne.
Lenne: Indeed, indeed. Well then, friend, might I ask what your name is? I believe neither of us are acquainted with it.
Traveler: #Traveler.
Lenne: A most uncommon name. But it is no crime to stand out from the crowd. I shall remember it.
Ootomo: #Traveler, mm? I'll remember it as well.

## Talk

Lenne: Inazuman poetry puts some limits on the number of words that may be in any given line. As such, they pay much attention to the length of each word, while the poems that emerge have both a neat look and a unique flavor to them.
Ootomo: Other than the lengths of words and phrases, Inazuman poets also love natural sights such as snow, the moon, and flowers.
Ootomo: Few of them write about freedom or the wind, though.
Ootomo: I plan to ponder the matter of expanding the content of our writing. Who knows? I might actually start a new wave in Inazuman poetry like this.
Lenne: Is that so? Ah, how I wish I could see that new work of yours right this instant!

## Talk

Lenne: Ah, when I think that this journey in Inazuma must end and that we shall not read each other poems again like this, I cannot help but feel a little sad.
Ootomo: Though they say that "all feasts must someday end," it is inevitable that we shall feel sadness. Lenne, shall we correspond via letters in the future?
Lenne: That would be wonderful!
