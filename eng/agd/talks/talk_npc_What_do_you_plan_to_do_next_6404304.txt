Traveler: What do you plan to do next?
Mansur: Well, at the moment, I'm simultaneously keeping the serious air pollution problem at the blacksmith's from the Akademiya while prolonging my internship here with Mr. Ahangar...
Mansur: Mr. Ahangar looked quite pleased to finally have an apprentice. I can get by well enough on my wages, so I guess I'll just take it one step at a time for now.
