Traveler: Dangers by the sea...
Kayvan: The shores of Sumeru are fraught with sea monster attacks, which often affect residents and fishermen who live along the coast and disrupt the merchant ships.
Kayvan: Fortunately, we're all familiar with the situation at sea and know how to protect ourselves. Plus, with the Eremites' assistance, there haven't been any major casualties.
Kayvan: The Akademiya's researchers have gradually come here, too, to investigate the pattern of the sea monster attacks, thus improving the effectiveness of our defense.
Kayvan: But just because the situation has improved, doesn't mean we can let our guard down. We must always watch out when near the sea and follow the instructions in case of an emergency.
