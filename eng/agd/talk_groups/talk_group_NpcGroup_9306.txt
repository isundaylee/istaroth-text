Xiangling: I imagine you'll wanna keep fighting soon — do you want a bite to eat first? You know you love my cooking!
Xiangling: You should never work on an empty stomach! More importantly, a proper meal will put you in a good mood, and you'll handle yourself better in a crisis.
Xiangling: Here, some chopsticks for ya. Don't be shy now, dig in!

Xiangling: Are you tired? I know a trick that works great — imagine all the enemies you're facing as delicious ingredients!
Xiangling: With all that tender, delicious-smelling food nearby... Doesn't it just give you a big burst of energy?
Xiangling: Huh? Hard to imagine? Hmm, maybe it's just me, then...

Xiangling: Only a handful of my more experimental dishes have made it onto the Wanmin Restaurant menu.
Xiangling: In most cases, it's because I think the texture isn't quite right, or the flavor needs a lot more work... But that doesn't mean I'm about to give up.
Xiangling: I know there are tasty dishes out there waiting to be discovered, and I'll find them sooner or later!
