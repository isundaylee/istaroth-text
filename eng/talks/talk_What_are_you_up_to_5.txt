Traveler: What are you up to?
Vermeer: As you can see, I'm a painter. I believe that wherever you go in the world, no matter how drab a place might seem, you can always find some color if you look closely enough.
Vermeer: I consider it my duty to travel all around the seven nations to discover brand new colors and then put them on a canvas for all to see!
Traveler: Are you looking for inspiration?
Vermeer: Yep! I saw this pool and thought, wow, what a magnificent sight!
Vermeer: Can you see why? You've got that cool blue of the water's surface contrasted with the slightly off-white cliff face, interspersed with bits of lush green vegetation... I just want to recreate every last bit of it on the canvas!
