Tartaglia: #Well, Traveler, you invited me to meet you here, so I'm guessing that means you're ready for a rematch?
Tartaglia: Haha, I'm just kidding, of course. This place is for resting, I wouldn't start a fight here â€” I do have some manners.
Tartaglia: I am getting a little restless here, though. Hope the next battle's a big one, I need a good workout.

Tartaglia: If you wanna become a true warrior, the strongest enemies are the ones you should be most excited about.
Tartaglia: After all, a gruesome, grisly fight to the death is one of the best ways to hone your skills.
Tartaglia: I honestly can't even get in the mood unless there's a bit of a challenge involved.

Tartaglia: Aside from all the children's books, I quite like some of the furnishings here. Like that Star Lamp, for example. I'm sure Tonia, Anthon, and Teucer would love it.
Tartaglia: Okay, there's my intro: "My dear sister, I am writing to you from a rest stop in an ancient castle filled with star lamps"...
Tartaglia: Hmm... Maybe that'll get them a little too intrigued? If they end up wanting to follow me here after reading this letter, then we'll be in trouble.
