Traveler: Who are you?
Draff: I am Draff, you can think of me as the head of the hunters. The best hunter in the town.
Draff: Most of meat from our hunts goes straight to the Good Hunter, a restaurant in the city.
Draff: If you're here to make a bulk order of meat, I'm afraid we don't have the capacity to take it on.
