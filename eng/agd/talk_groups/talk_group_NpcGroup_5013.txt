Traveler: About White Iron Chunks...
Pruniere: Wow, Euphrasie wasn't kidding! If you ask for help in the paper, someone really will come.
Pruniere: #This is great! Thanks so much, kindhearted sir. Do you have the White Iron Chunks?
Traveler: White Iron Chunks are ready.
Traveler: Not yet.
Pruniere: I'm really sorry for making you go through all this, but I really need all those White Iron Chunks. See if you can think of a way to get it all.

Traveler: Not yet, as far as I know...
Pruniere: "Yet," you say... Ominous, but I suppose no news is good news.
Pruniere: You know what we maintenance staff fear the most? Cracks that we can't see!
Pruniere: It is like sand concealed amidst flour — one little error can ruin a whole loaf of bread.
Pruniere: Ah, yes, there's another problem, which is people who take tools willy-nilly.
Pruniere: There was once, when I simply left my crowbar at my side for a moment, and some passer-by just... took it!
Pruniere: Fortunately, he returned it after giving someone a bit of a thwacking or something, or I wouldn't have been able to work that day.

Traveler: So, the important thing here is work?
Pruniere: For me it is, yes.
Pruniere: I remember that the person who got tripped up was a thief, right? Serves him right.
Pruniere: There was a journalist who came over for an interview, but I chased him away. I mean, what do I know about public security? It's not something for me to consider.
Pruniere: And wouldn't you know it, isn't there a Melusine in plain clothes looking this way?
