## Talk

Inkanak: Sure enough, working together with capable people lets us meet new challenges.

## Talk

Traveler: You are...
Inkanak: I am the manager of the flight trial grounds, and I'm involved in organizing much of the work that gets done here.
Inkanak: The arena's a very important place for the Flower-Feather Clan. In my heart, its importance is second only to the totem pole.
Inkanak: After all, the fate of many a flying squad member or associate member is determined here.
Inkanak: That's how a person's fate is. Sometimes up, sometimes down, like the undulating wind. But if I could, I'd love to be the breeze beneath everyone's wings.

## Talk

Traveler: How have things been lately?
Inkanak: Welcome back to the Flower-Feather Clan. Everything's going well here!
Inkanak: We were in a rough spot before, but good thing we had formidable folks like you and Chasca around â€” it all worked out in the end.
Inkanak: I also get that some of my proposals are a little too focused on efficiency over safety...
Inkanak: But somehow, they always wind up getting picked up and implemented by people like yourself, so I guess I'm just lucky like that.
Inkanak: Are you saying that it's human nature to tackle challenges head-on?

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Inkanak: See ya!
