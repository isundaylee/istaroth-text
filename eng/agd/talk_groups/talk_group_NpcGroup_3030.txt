Aratani: Well, that's this problem solved. Next, we need to consider the next event... Should we increase the number of ways in which people can draw prizes...
Aratani: Other than the festival, we can't afford to dilly-dally on any of our plans...
Aratani: Ah, speaking of which, the books from "that place" in Ritou will probably arrive soon. I can use them as reference...

Aratani: Should I do a special issue... Hmm, a serial release would be fine, too...

Traveler: Who are you?
Aratani: Oh, me? I work at Yae Publishing House. I'm in charge of the planning and promotion of all our projects.
Aratani: Take the "This Novel Is Amazing!" contest, for example. It was I who proposed, organized, and set it up.
Aratani: My boss Hiratsuka didn't approve of that originally. Not sure if it was because he was too much of a stick in the mud or just didn't want to do more work...
Aratani: Thankfully, I pushed harder and promised that I would complete all of the work myself. Only then did the contest become a thing in the end.
Aratani: I mean, just look! Hasn't "This Novel Is Amazing!" become our most important project now? Every light novel reader pays rapt attention to the result of the contest — all thanks to me!
Aratani: Actually, I have been planning for some new project recently. Just you wait and see.

## Talk

Traveler: The books from what place in Ritou now?
Aratani: Eh? You heard that? Well... Never mind. You're an outlander right? You should be able to understand me.
Aratani: Because of the Sakoku Decree, it's getting harder and harder to get foreign books. But my job relies on creativity, so I have to learn new stuff, right?
Aratani: Therefore, I will secretly ask people who can enter and leave Inazuma to bring some new books from outside. If there are some confiscated books from Ritou, I will also tell them to smuggle them in.
Aratani: You have to keep this a secret for me. In exchange, I'll let you read the new books.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Aratani: Yes, yes, that's how we'll do it... Oh, alright, goodbye.

## Talk

Traveler: Could I ask about a novelist by the name of Sumida...
Aratani: Sumida... Huh, speaking of that, I haven't actually seen her in a while.
Aratani: She bade me a solemn farewell sometime back, saying that she was on her way out to travel, and that I should await her grand victory in the "This Novel Is Amazing!" contest.
Aratani: Even though, you know, she hasn't actually finished a single novel ever...

## Talk

Traveler: Not a single one?
Aratani: Nope. Her logic jumps all over the place, and my standards are pretty strict, so her projects often wind up abandoned half-baked.
Aratani: Still, I have rather high hopes for her. The stories written by such people tend to be the best.
Aratani: I hope she can keep her promise, either way, and send a manuscript worthy of the grand prize to me as a souvenir of her travels.

Traveler: The books from what place in Ritou now?
Aratani: Well, I mean, my job relies on creativity, so I have to learn new stuff, right?
Aratani: That's why I often ask friends to send me new books from overseas. If there are some impounded books over in Ritou, I will also tell them to bring them in.
Aratani: You have to keep that whole "impounded books" business a secret for me, alright? In exchange, I'll let you read the new stuff next time.

## Talk

Aratani: Ugh, how am I supposed to contact these two authors in this situation...
Traveler: Contact who now?
Aratani: Oh! Traveler, it's you... Thank goodness you're here. I was just in need of someone's help!
Aratani: Here's the problem: Yae Publishing House's annual novel-writing competition is about to begin, and as is our rule, we plan to invite a few of our writers to serve on the judging panel.
Aratani: However, we have two writers who are neither Inazuman, nor do they currently reside in Inazuma.
Aratani: As you know, the present circumstances prevent us from inviting outlanders here.
Aratani: But if we fail to inform the writers of such an important matter, that would also be inappropriate...
Aratani: So I thought that if someone could at least send them a gift, the basic courtesies would at least be satisfied. And we could also attach a letter discussing future manuscripts— *cough* I mean...
Aratani: Would you be willing to help me out?
Traveler: I'll take care of it.
Aratani: We're counting on you, Traveler.
Aratani: Chang the Ninth's story, known as the "First Apprentice of Guhua," is a tale about the first apprentice of a famed martial arts school in Liyue and a young girl from Inazuma whom he took on as a junior apprentice.
Aratani: If you were to ask me, the themes and plot are just a little outdated by this point, but enough readers buy it to keep sales up.
Aratani: We often ask people to send some letters to him to suggest certain changes he might make in future works to perhaps make a breakthrough...
Aratani: But we have never received a reply. Perhaps the letters were lost on the way, or...
Traveler: Who's Zhenyu?
Aratani: Now this one, I have no idea about. It's likely a pen name of some sort.
Aratani: But the book "A Legend of Sword"? That one's an earth-shatterer and a world-shaker, make no mistake!
Aratani: Both the setting and the story have sent veritable shocks throughout the literary world!
Traveler: Well, where do I find this writer, then...
Aratani: Hmm. I believe that this writer also lives in Liyue. According to a traveling merchant who brought this book back to Inazuma, he first found this text at Wanwen Bookhouse.
Aratani: I think that if you ask the staff at Wanwen Bookhouse, you should be able to find this author.
Aratani: However... *cough* Well, never mind that for now. Here are the presents and the letters. I'm putting this in your reliable hands, Traveler!
Traveler: Who are these writers again?
Aratani: One of them is named Zhenyu, and the other is... Chang the Ninth.

Aratani: However, we have two writers who are neither Inazuman, nor do they currently reside in Inazuma.
Aratani: As you know, the journey here is a long and tiring one over land and sea, and it will be quite the undertaking to bring both authors here.
Aratani: It would be nice, of course, if they could come. But regardless, it would not be polite of us to not even give them so much as notification that the event is occurring.
