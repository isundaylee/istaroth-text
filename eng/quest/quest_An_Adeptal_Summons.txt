# An Adeptal Summons


## Talk 1

Cloud Retainer: These are indeed the blueprints for my Dwelling in the Clouds. One is most pleased.
Traveler: You still haven't said what you're gonna—
Cloud Retainer: Must you continue to question me? *sigh* Very well, considering you did make an offering...
Cloud Retainer: One has heard of a certain Jade Chamber that hangs in the air above Liyue, built by mortal hands.
Cloud Retainer: One has also heard that mortals value size above all else, and have on this basis proceeded to declare that said chamber is without parallel in all the world.
Cloud Retainer: Hmph! Such are the limits of mortal comprehension, that they fail to fathom the ingenuity of the adepti.
Cloud Retainer: Jade Chamber my foot! A glimpse at the most trivial of my mechanical accomplishments would reveal the Jade Chamber to be an utterly tedious and mundane piece of work...
Traveler: Sore loser much...
Cloud Retainer: Nonsense! I am no loser, nor am I afflicted with sores... I merely pity the foolish! These mortals, blind to adepti ingenuity, bedazzled by the crudest of craftsmanship...
Cloud Retainer: I fear that this will cause mechanics among mortals to develop in a woefully mistaken direction. It falls to me to point them down the right path.
Cloud Retainer: The matter at hand is concluded. Leave at once.

## Talk 2

Visit the adeptus' abode: State your business at once! One has a myriad matters to which one must attend. Waste not the valuable time of an adeptus!
Traveler: Just wanted to see how you're doing...
Visit the adeptus' abode: ...
Visit the adeptus' abode: Your business is a novel one... You simply came to wish me well, and not to fulfill a wish of some other nature?
Visit the adeptus' abode: Very well, so be it! Mortal minds work in mysterious ways... I have no interest in attempting to understand them.
Visit the adeptus' abode: Since you are so demonstrably idle at present... Would you care to do me a small favor?
Visit the adeptus' abode: Once upon a time, when I had made a modest breakthrough in my mechanical studies, I built for myself a Dwelling in the Clouds suspended in the air.
Visit the adeptus' abode: This Dwelling in the Clouds was built principally from plaustrite, supported by a multitude of other ingenious features... In fact, its most marvelous feature of all was, was... Never mind, you would not understand even if I explained it.
Visit the adeptus' abode: After construction of the Dwelling in the Clouds was complete, I left the blueprints there.
Visit the adeptus' abode: I also added a seal, thinking that one of true affinity with the blueprints might eventually obtain them. But no — to this day, the seal stands.
Visit the adeptus' abode: It now seems a needless bother to me to have the blueprints stored there. Perhaps you can retrieve them from the Dwelling in the Clouds for me.
Traveler: Sure!
Visit the adeptus' abode: Such enthusiasm. Then do not delay, deliver them to my abode when you have found them, for that is where I shall be waiting for you.
Traveler: What are you gonna do with it?
Visit the adeptus' abode: Naturally, I have my reasons. But please, do not presume that you could scrutinize an idea conceived in the mind of an adeptus.
Visit the adeptus' abode: Delay no further. Deliver them to my abode when you have found them, for that is where I shall be waiting for you.

## Talk 3

Visit the adeptus' abode: You still have not obtained the blueprints? But they are right there, in the Dwelling in the Clouds...
Paimon: Ugh, how'd she know we hadn't fetched them yet?
Visit the adeptus' abode: Those blueprints are a work of my own hand, should I not be able to sense when they are in my presence? Now, fetch them forthwith!

## Talk 4

Visit the adeptus' abode: I see you have obtained the blueprints. Now, hand them to me forthwith!

## Talk 5

Cloud Retainer: Whyever are you still here? Leave at once, and disturb me no further.

### Additional Talk 1

Visit the adeptus' abode: To seek the adepti in Jueyun is no mean feat. Still, you have come forth...
Paimon: Whoa! D—Didn't she already go to Liyue Harbor? Did she sneak back here while we weren't looking?
Traveler: Her voice... doesn't sound quite right.
Paimon: Uh, so, we were just worried that someone might steal stuff from your place. We didn't mean to disturb you.
Visit the adeptus' abode: ...One has a task you might perform. Perform it well, and access to one's abode shall be granted.
Traveler: She's just talking to herself at this point...
Paimon: Err, so you mean that this isn't her we're talking to, but some sorta machine she left behind?
Visit the adeptus' abode: Once upon a time, when one had made a modest breakthrough in my mechanical studies, one built for oneself a Dwelling in the Clouds suspended in the air.
Visit the adeptus' abode: And when said Dwelling was completed, one thought upon the rarity of meeting an adeptus, and there one left the blueprint, for some fated person to take them.
Visit the adeptus' abode: Retrieve the blueprint before entering one's abode once more. We shall speak more at that time.
Traveler: Err, Lady Adeptus?
Paimon: Cloud Retainer? Xian... Err, Ms. Xianyun...?
Visit the adeptus' abode: Retrieve the blueprint to complete this task, and then one's abode once more. We shall speak more at that time.
Paimon: On and on she goes, without paying attention to us at all, huh?
Traveler: Definitely a machine.
Paimon: But aren't abode machine guards usually the... punchier sort?
Traveler: She might have her considerations.
Paimon: Well, why don't we go get it and then come back and look inside the abode?
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon's kinda curious about what machine she's left in there, too.
Traveler: I'm a bit concerned about that blueprint...
Traveler: It's started to repeat the last line...
Traveler: Could the voice be coming from some sort of device...?

### Additional Talk 3

Visit the adeptus' abode: The blueprints you have retrieved, adeptal fate you have received. Come hither and seek your audience.

### Additional Talk 4

Paimon: ...Errr, what is this? It's a table... and a box on top of it, and nothing else anywhere!
Traveler: It's an adeptal table.
Cloud Retainer...?: You have reached this place, and one knows already your heart...
Paimon: Uh, it's talking again!
Cloud Retainer...?: Pen down your wish, and consign it to the chest. One shall make the final decision.
Cloud Retainer...?: Dangers you have braved with an unwavering will — a rare gift indeed. Take, then, these treasures with you.
Paimon: Woohoo! Hehe, Paimon knew you wouldn't let us come away empty-handed!
Paimon: Still, this voice says, "Pen down your wish, and consign it to the chest." Guess we just write our wish down and put it in?
Traveler: Best not to make a wish to the adepti willy-nilly...
Paimon: Yeah, that's right. We could just go to... Ms. Xianyun directly if something came up, hehe.
Paimon: In that case, let's just put the blueprint in and leave, shall we?
Paimon: This place sure is empty, though. Guess she must've taken everything with her.
Traveler: What sort of situation were these devices made for, anyway...
Paimon: Paimon doesn't know either...
Paimon: But we can just ask her about her abode the next time we meet.
Traveler: Making a wish to someone you know feels a bit...
Traveler: And an adeptal box.
