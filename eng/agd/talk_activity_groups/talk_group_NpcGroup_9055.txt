Gorou: #Hey, Traveler! You're back!
Gorou: So what's up, everything alright?

## Talk

Traveler: Are you settling in okay?
Gorou: Yeah, you bet! Don't worry, I'm exceedingly good at adapting to new environments.
Gorou: There've been times in the past when I've had to make do with a rock for a pillow, or just find a patch of grass to lie down on. In the army, you learn how to sleep well wherever you are.
Traveler: So do you feel that life here is too relaxed?
Gorou: Haha, why would you think that?
Gorou: If your bowstring is always drawn tight, it will eventually snap.
Gorou: Relaxation is an essential part of improving as a fighter. So as far as I'm concerned, this place is the perfect antidote to the tension of battle!
Gorou: Which brings me to you. I wanted to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude for everything you've done for me. Thank you!
Gorou: You've always been genuine with me, it truly warms my heart.
Gorou: Anyway, don't worry, I'm not here to just take advantage and lounge around. I'm ready to switch to combat mode at a moment's notice!
Traveler: Well, you can finally take it easy here...
Gorou: *sigh*... Seems so.
Gorou: Time of peace is hard to come by. I will cherish every moment of it.

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Gorou: Sure!
Gorou: How about I tell you some stories from my time in the resistance? I can think of a few you're not likely to hear from anybody else...
Traveler: I'd love to know more...
Gorou: Alright! The truth is, not every soldier that joins the resistance goes through formal training, so new soldiers make small mistakes from time to time.
Gorou: For example, one time during a mock expedition, one of the new soldiers didn't store his rations carefully enough. They went bad, and he ended up eating nothing but Radishes for two whole weeks.
Gorou: Another time during a scouting operation, a new soldier mistook animal trails for enemy trails. They ended up playing cat and mouse with a forest boar for three whole days...
Gorou: Thankfully, these were just small oversights, and never caused any serious consequences. On the contrary, we often have a good laugh about these things during our down time.
Gorou: But when I think about it, I'm sure we would avoid issues like these if we reformed some of our guidelines.
Gorou: We should be mixing veteran soldiers and newer soldiers together. This way, veteran soldiers can act as mentors and share their experience with the newer soldiers...
Gorou: Uh, my apologies, I began thinking out loud there!
Gorou: I can go over these reforms some other time! Right now, I'm chatting with you, so I should keep it light.
Traveler: I want to hear more about the Ever-Victorious General.
Gorou: ...You want to hear my story?
Gorou: Uhh...
Gorou: Soldiers love boasting about my military achievements to other people, but I always feel that talking about my own experience gives the impression I'm boasting.
Traveler: I want to hear it!
Gorou: Heh, you know I can't say no to you, don't you? ...Wait, that's why you asked, isn't it?
Gorou: Heh... Alright, I guess there's no way out of this one...
Gorou: Let me think... Okay, let me tell you the thrilling tale of my one-man scouting mission to the north of Nazuchi Beach.
Gorou: Here's what I remember from that day...
Traveler: I would never think you're boasting.

## Talk

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Gorou: Yeah! I heard from Tubby the Butler Bird that she can change the terrain to whatever you want.
Gorou: So, could you build a really tall mountain? The steeper the better — I want it to be a tough climb.
Gorou: Then, let's you and I have a race to the top!
Traveler: No problem.
Gorou: Wow, you didn't take much persuading! Thank you!
Gorou: I used to go mountain climbing with my resistance comrades all the time. It was a great way to test our physical limits while also having some fun together... I have so many treasured memories.
Gorou: But something tells me that the chance to climb a mountain with you would become the happiest memory of them all.
Gorou: In fact, I would love to share every happy moment with you.
Traveler: I understand.
Gorou: Hah, you're too kind! Alright... how about we find a relatively safe mountain trail and see who makes it to the top the fastest? Are you up to the challenge!?
Gorou: The loser has to treat the winner to a three-course meal... and at least one of the courses has to be dessert...
Traveler: I... just want to touch your tail...
Gorou: Uh? What a weird request...
Gorou: But, fine... if you win, of course!
Gorou: I... Fine, I'll allow it. But only if you win.
Gorou: For the sake of my tail, I will give it everything I got! If you're serious about winning this, you're gonna have your work cut out for you!
Gorou: Right! We should probably warm up first...
Traveler: I want to use your tail as a pillow when I go to sleep...
Gorou: What!? My tail... as a pillow...
Traveler: Gorou, I also want to thank you.

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Gorou.
Gorou: #Morning, Traveler!
Gorou: I've completed my training for the day. If you plan on leaving now, then let me accompany you!

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Gorou.
Gorou: #Good night, Traveler.
Gorou: Rest well, friend. Remember that the secret to good sleep is letting go of all your worries.
Gorou: Therefore, the "Ever-Victorious General" is here to protect you.

## Talk

Gorou: A village can provide troops, conceal provisions, assist with reconnaissance, and so on... They often function as key strategic locations in resistance operations.
Gorou: The layout of this village is quite conventional, I doubt anyone could point to anything that's out of place. You've clearly done your homework on Inazuma's environment!
Gorou: I am thoroughly impressed by your abilities.

## Talk

Gorou: Nothing beats a warm and cozy hot spring...
Gorou: Just half an hour in a hot spring is enough to get rid of all the fatigue that accumulates during training and battle.
Gorou: Do you mind if I take a dip now? Ooh! You wanna join me?
