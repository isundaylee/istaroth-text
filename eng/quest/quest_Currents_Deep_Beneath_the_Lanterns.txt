# Currents Deep Beneath the Lanterns


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hello again, Wang'ya! How's the Mingxiao Lantern construction coming along?
Wang'ya: Good to see you two! The Mingxiao Lantern is coming along smoothly, thank you. We're almost done collecting the required Plaustrite.
Wang'ya: The project should be completed in a few days... You'll have to come by when it's done!
Traveler: Plaustrite?
Wang'ya: Mm-hmm, plaustrite is the main component of any Mingxiao Lantern. Most of the donations we get from the city folk are either Mora or Plaustrite.
Wang'ya: A lot of them carve their heart's desires onto the Plaustrite they donate, as a prayer for good fortune and other blessings.
Paimon: #Paimon wants some good fortune too! Let's find some Plaustrite and make a wish, {NICKNAME}.
Wang'ya: Hm, since you seem so eager to donate, how about you keep your eyes open for less common varieties of Plaustrite? Those are the ones we lack the most at the moment.
Wang'ya: One is called <color=#00E1FFFF>Azurite</color>. It is occasionally found in the northern part of Mt. Tianheng.
Wang'ya: When Azurite gets caught in the roots of ordinary vegetation, it sometimes produces <color=#00E1FFFF>Bloatty Floatties</color>, which have floating seeds.
Wang'ya: The other one is called <color=#00E1FFFF>Vermillionite</color>, which is extremely dangerous as far as most people are concerned...
Wang'ya: In Guili Plains, old <color=#00E1FFFF>Ruin Hunters</color> who have lost the power of flight use <color=#00E1FFFF>Vermillionite</color> to keep themselves airborne.
Traveler: We'll head out to look for those then.
Wang'ya: It's a tall order, but I'm sure you can manage.
Traveler: What makes them so special?
Wang'ya: Well... they're just more stylish, I suppose.
Wang'ya: (Actually, they're just blue and red varieties of Plaustrite... Gemstone merchants only gave them fancy names to try and impress their customers...)
Wang'ya: Uh, the difference in their features compared to regular Plaustrite might be minuscule... but the difference in price is astonishing.
Wang'ya: No, no, never mind that. Just bring some <color=#00E1FFFF>Azurite</color> and <color=#00E1FFFF>Vermillionite</color> back to me. I'm counting on you!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Wang'ya, we're back with a fresh supply of Azurite and Vermillionite!
Wang'ya: I knew I could count on you! Let me see... Hmm... Yep! Without a doubt, these are Azurite and Vermillionite.
Wang'ya: But don't you want to make your wishes? You brought back just enough materials for both of you. Come on, get carving!
Paimon: Done! Paimon prays for a bottomless stomach to eat more delicacies with!
Paimon: And you? Let Paimon see... Huh? Well, that doesn't sound like something you'd wish for...
Traveler: #That's my {M#sister}{F#brother}'s deepest desire.
Paimon: #So you made a wish for {M#her}{F#him} instead...
Paimon: #Don't you worry, Paimon will help you find {M#her}{F#him}, and we'll spend the next Lantern Rite together.
Paimon: Then, we'll release a gazillion Xiao Lanterns to make up for all those wishes you've never had a chance to make!
Traveler: We sure will.
Wang'ya: If you're done with your carvings, you can hand over your Azurite and Vermillionite to me.
Changchang: Ms. Wang'ya...
Wang'ya: Well hello, Changchang! What's up, little missy? Can't find your granddad?
Changchang: Granddad said he's busy and I should go play on my own.
Changchang: I wanna make a Xiao Lantern, but I don't know how...
Changchang: Ms. Wang'ya, could you help me make a Xiao Lantern?
Wang'ya: Sure thing! But promise me that you'll go back home as soon as we're done playing. With so many people at the festival, your granddad will be worried sick if you stay out too long.
Changchang: Hehe. Thank you, Ms. Wang'ya! I'll be a good girl, I promise!
Traveler: So, you know how to make Xiao Lanterns too?
Wang'ya: I certainly do! That's how I made my first Mora, helping visitors make Xiao Lanterns by the docks. Ah... Good times, hehe!
Wang'ya: I should really stay here to keep an eye on the girl — hey, could I bother you to go to the <color=#00E1FFFF>construction site</color> at <color=#00E1FFFF>the dock</color>, and gather some building materials?
Traveler: Happy to help.
Wang'ya: Great, thanks. I appreciate it.
Traveler: #I really hope {M#her}{F#his} wish will come true.
Paimon: #Oh... so you put your {M#sister}{F#brother}'s wish rather than your own...

## Talk 3

???: Hey, whatcha doin'?
???: Whatcha staring at me like that for? Get gone!
???: Wha— Huh?
???: ...Alright, if you all won't get gone, I'm just gonna get going myself I guess...
Paimon: Wow. Paimon thought he might be a shady character, then he opened his mouth and now Paimon's sure of it!
Paimon: He must have been up to something when he was crouching down on the ground. Because as soon as he saw us approaching, he stood up and acted all innocent...
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon has a bad feeling about this...
Paimon: What could he be up to? Let's investigate!

## Talk 4

Paimon: On the last day of the Lantern Rite, huge crowds come out to watch the Mingxiao Lantern being released.
Paimon: It can't be a good sign if there's a suspicious character lurking around somewhere so dangerous.
Paimon: If he's been tampering with the stockpile of lantern supplies...
Paimon: Let's get the materials we came for first. We can tell Wang'ya about the situation when we get back.
Traveler: Paimon, you're taking this very seriously. Why?
Paimon: Because... Because... Everyone in Liyue has worked really hard for this! No one should be allowed to spoil it, period!
Traveler: ...What's the real reason?
Paimon: Oh, fine... There's so many delicacies in Liyue Harbor! Matsutake Meat Rolls, Mora Meat, Almond Tofu...
Traveler: Are you reading those off a menu?
Paimon: Hehehe...

## Talk 5

Wang'ya: Did you get the materials?
Traveler: Sure did.
Wang'ya: Ah, yes! These will do. Let me make a Xiao Lantern for Changchang.
Traveler: There's more...
Paimon: We saw a shady character skulking around the highly flammable materials at the construction site!
Paimon: He looked like he was up to no good...
Wang'ya: I see... Okay, please inform the <color=#00E1FFFF>Ministry of Civil Affairs</color> about what you saw. I'll talk to Jingming.
Wang'ya: With so many people visiting for the Lantern Rite, we can't afford to ignore something like this.
Changchang: Ms. Wang'ya, is something bad gonna happen at the Lantern Rite?
Wang'ya: Not to a darling little angel like you, Changchang! Come on now, good girl, head back to your granddad and don't get distracted along the way. We don't want to make him worry.

## Talk 6

Jiayi: Halt! This is the Liyue Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Traveler: We are here to report a suspicious individual.
Paimon: Yeah, we saw a shady-looking guy snooping around near the stockpile of highly flammable Mingxiao Lantern supplies!
Paimon: We must defend the Grilled Tiger Fish food stall at all costs!
Jiayi: Hmm, goodness! This is a serious matter indeed.
Paimon: Exactly what Paimon thought! Liyue Harbor's cuisine is the heart and soul of the city—
Jiayi: ...It seems we disagree on where the seriousness of the matter lies. But you're not wrong, my little friend.
Jiayi: Rest easy, the Ministry of Civil Affairs has assigned a specialist to keep the Lantern Rite safe.
Jiayi: I will inform him of this matter and order him to step up vigilance in due course.
Paimon: "In due course"? This is serious, why not get your butt over there and tell him straight away?
Jiayi: I wish I could, but he's yet to return. He's taken a small team to <color=#00E1FFFF>Guili Plains</color>.
Traveler: I'll go to Guili Plains and tell them.
Jiayi: Huh? Uh... But you're a traveler, aren't you? You've come all this way for the Lantern Rite, and yet you are willing to lend a hand...?
Paimon: Our pleasure! We're experts in this kinda stuff. We lend hands all the time, like the time we—
Traveler: Ahem, leave it to us.
Jiayi: R—Really? Then we are indebted to you. Travelers are so kind these days...
Jiayi: Ah yes, no commission should go unpaid...
Jiayi: I will take care of the compensation. Again, thank you both.
Traveler: Another day, another commission...
Jiayi: What commission...? Oh, is this your way of offering to go to <color=#00E1FFFF>Guili Plains</color> and pass on the message for me?
Jiayi: But you're a traveler, aren't you? You've come all this way for the Lantern Rite, and yet here you are willing to lend a hand...
Traveler: The food stalls must be protected!
Paimon: Yeah! We must defend the food stalls! Let nobody touch them!
Jiayi: Uh — absolutely! Haha... I can't thank you enough.

## Talk 7

Traveler: Jiayi sent us.
Xinghuo: Wh—Who are you?
Traveler: What is it you're doing here?
Xinghuo: Oh... Thank you. If it weren't for your help, today may have ended quite differently.
Xinghuo: I'm in charge of keeping the Lantern Rite safe. A lot comes out of the woodwork at this time of year, there are thieves around every corner.
Xinghuo: I encountered one during my patrol just now, so I called a few men and we pursued them out here.
Xinghuo: Once we got here we decided to split up. I was searching this area.
Xinghuo: The thief seems to have made a clean getaway, and I sure didn't bank on these monsters being here...
Xinghuo: I was just assessing whether it would be better to send for reinforcements, or find another way to disperse them... And that's when you showed up and dealt with them.
Xinghuo: *sigh* And thank goodness. I don't know how long it would've taken for the others to get here.
Xinghuo: Well, I need to get back to looking for that thief... But thanks for your help. Until next time...
Paimon: Wait a second! We're not done here!
Traveler: There's a suspicious character down at the harbor...
Xinghuo: Oh? Is there something else?
Xinghuo: Ugh, another one? *sigh* It's interminable...
Xinghuo: Right. When I get back, I'll get the other troops to be extra vigilant in the area.
Xinghuo: *sigh* In the middle of the festival too. What are they up to...
Traveler: That the Ministry of Civil Affairs isn't up to the task?
Traveler: Perhaps we should take this into our own hands.
Paimon: Do you get the feeling...
Paimon: Paimon thinks so too!
Paimon: The locals must take all their tasty treats for granted by now.
Paimon: But for a poor traveler, all alone out in the wilderness, often forced to survive on nothing but the most mysterious of mushrooms...
Paimon: For you, the Lantern Rite is the most important of all festivals!
Paimon: Paimon thinks so too!
Paimon: With our wealth of experience adventuring far and wide, we should be able to get to the bottom of this.
Paimon: So let's go back to the place where we <color=#00E1FFFF>witnessed the shady-looking guy</color>.
Traveler: But the crime hasn't even happened yet...
Paimon: Paimon hears from patrol officers that criminals love to go back for another look at the crime scene after the event. Eh, it's a psychological thing, apparently.
Paimon: That's why there's no time to lose! When there's highly flammable materials involved, once the crime happens it'll be too late!

## Talk 8

Paimon: Aha! Knew it!
Traveler: Should we chase after him?
Paimon: Wait, there's another person—
Traveler: We should chase after him.

## Talk 9

Xiao: ...What are you doing here?
Paimon: Huh? Xiao... Are you here for the festival?
Xiao: I have no interest in Lantern Rite.
Xiao: I sensed a malign influence here. I'm here to investigate.
Xiao: When a shackle is loosened in the realms of deities and demons, I take full responsibility.
Xiao: But this time, the threat comes from the mortal world — your world. Thus you shall take full responsibility, mortal traveler.
Xiao: When the time comes, I hope you shall act promptly and decisively...
Xiao: I do not wish for the tassel of the polearm that has slaughtered countless demons to become stained with mortal blood.
Paimon: What's this?
Traveler: Paimon, do you recognize it?
Xiao: A symbol that your suspected evildoer left behind.
Paimon: Doesn't look familiar to Paimon.
Xiao: Well, you will have to show me how much you can accomplish on your own strength.
Traveler: Then it's up to me to avoid that...
Traveler: Actually, quite a festive color in this part of the world...
Xiao: Because if I become involved, there is a possibility that the streets of Liyue Harbor will be painted red this Lantern Rite.
Paimon: That sounds terrible!
Paimon: Ahh, let's not be impulsive. Why don't we figure out the origins of this symbol first?
Paimon: The one the suspected criminal left behind... Oh!
Paimon: Paimon has a sneaking suspicion that Kaeya will know something about it...

## Talk 10

Kaeya: #Well, well, long time no see, {NICKNAME}!
Paimon: Kaeya, we went to the Lantern Rite in Liyue!
Kaeya: Ah. Well, how was it? Fun?
Paimon: Delicious!
Kaeya: Well then, you ought to be looking forward to Mondstadt's Ludi Harpastum. I'm sure it will be to your liking.
Traveler: Get to the point, Paimon.
Paimon: Right, right! Kaeya, there's something we need to tell you about.
Kaeya: Hmm... Lantern supplies... Stockpile of wood, paper, and oil... At the very least, it sounds like an accident waiting to happen.
Kaeya: Haha, how very amusing. What makes you think I would recognize this symbol?
Traveler: You're amazing at everything and we trust you.
Paimon: Oh, that about sums it up!
Kaeya: Hah. I'm flattered, but don't you think you might be overestimating me?
Paimon: There it is! At last, Kaeya displays the knightly virtue of modesty, perfectly articulated and masterfully delivered.
Kaeya: My goodness, your stay in Liyue seems to have sharpened your wit and broadened your vocabulary.
Kaeya: Anyway, I digress. This is the symbol of the cross-border criminal organization you know as the Treasure Hoarders.
Kaeya: If you are curious to know more, I can put you in touch with an informant on the inside.
Paimon: Uhh, didn't you just say the Knights of Favonius don't have dealings with their enemies!?
Kaeya: ...This is my own personal informant. Nothing to do with the Knights of Favonius.
Kaeya: A little later, make your way over to Windrise. I'll arrange for the informant to meet you there.
Paimon: Thanks, Kaeya.
Kaeya: Oh, and remember: "wine begets wisdom."
Paimon: Huh?
Traveler: You flirt with the dark side, so you would know.
Paimon: Exactly!
Kaeya: Uh-ah! You should watch what you say, Honorary Knight.
Kaeya: What do you mean, flirt with the dark side? The Knights of Favonius certainly does not have dealings with its enemies.
Kaeya: That has to do with a certain knightly virtue called "integrity."

## Talk 11

Nimrod: Huh...
Paimon: Hey! You're the guy, right? Kaeya's informant?
Nimrod: Informant? Not me.
Paimon: But... This is the place we agreed upon... and you're the only other one here, so...
Nimrod: "Place we agreed upon"? Heh, I know nothing.
Paimon: Ugh, stop being so annoying!
Traveler: Wine begets wisdom.
Nimrod: Okay. Yeah, it's me.
Paimon: How was any of that even slightly necessary!?
Nimrod: What do you want to know about?
Paimon: *sigh* Here's the situation...
Nimrod: Okay. I see.
Paimon: So? What can you tell us as an insider?
Nimrod: I do not think this is the work of the Treasure Hoarders.
Nimrod: The reason the Treasure Hoarders are able to sustain a giant cross-border operation is because they abide by one fundamental principle:
Nimrod: Caution. Softly softly catchee monkey is the name of the game for them. By contrast, the idea of taking huge risks to try and make a fortune is utter folly in their eyes.
Nimrod: Liyue has the adepti looking after it, doesn't it? And they're especially active during the Lantern Rite...
Nimrod: There's just no way that we... sorry, "they"! Slip of the tongue — when you've been undercover as long as I have, heh, where was I... Oh, yes — There's just no way that they — the Treasure Hoarders — would dare make a move during the Lantern Rite.
Nimrod: Also... the Treasure Hoarders' organization in Liyue recently received an anonymous letter.
Paimon: Why would someone send them an anonymous letter? Trying to frame them, perhaps?
Nimrod: Nobody knows. But what I can tell you is which branch of the Treasure Hoarders has the letter in their possession.
Nimrod: ...There. I've marked their location on the map for you.
Paimon: #Great. Well, Paimon thinks this was productive! {NICKNAME}, this is our only solid lead. Let's not waste it!
Nimrod: If there's nothing more, I should get back to treasure hoarding. ...I mean, get back to those treasure-hoarding lowlifes. To spy on them. Heh.
Traveler: Something about... wine?
Nimrod: Uh...
Paimon: ...
Nimrod: Okay... technically the wrong password, but... yes, it's something about wine, and assuming that something is the thing about it begetting wisdom, then...
Nimrod: Yeah, close enough. It's me.
Paimon: How was any of that even slightly necessary!?

## Talk 12

Bei'er: Sorry mate, wrong way. Wherever you think you're going, it's that way.
Paimon: But isn't that the way to Liyue Harbor?
Bei'er: Right. Here is nowhere. So the other way is Liyue Harbor.
Traveler: Show us the anonymous letter.
Crafty: If you're looking for somewhere to stay, I suggest you go to the Wangshu Inn. Fair prices, great customer service, and a wonderful view.
Bei'er: ...How do you know about the letter?
Paimon: ...Uh, one of Liyue's adepti told us about it!
Bei'er: Did they now? I somehow doubt that.
Xiao: You should not doubt it. It was I who sent them to investigate.
Xiao: Any further questioning, you may direct to me.
Traveler: That's an adeptus for you...
Paimon: Argh! Did you just appear out of thin air!?
Bei'er: ...You're the Vigilant Yaksha!?
Paimon: Hey, watch your tone of voice! Or do you seriously wanna pick a fight with an adeptus?
Crafty: Uh, okay. It's not that we don't believe you're an adeptus, it's just... Everyone needs to look at the bigger picture here.
Bei'er: As you well know, we Treasure Hoarders are no serious threat to anyone. We're petty criminals, that's all.
Crafty: So if you are truly an adeptus, please... Show us some mercy, would you?
Bei'er: Of course, if it turns out you're not a real adeptus...
Crafty: Then please, don't blame our weapons for treating everyone equally...

## Talk 13

Bei'er: Please, oh great one! Heroic Yaksha of Liyue! Divine Adeptus and friend of the people! Have mercy!
Crafty: The letter is drivel anyway! It's not worth an armed conflict... Just take it!
Paimon: How about that — Paimon knew it all along!
Paimon: Let's see what they wrote.
Xiao: I see. Then let us send these two to the meeting.
Xiao: The sender may be plotting something truly diabolical for the Lantern Rite. It seems they want to burn down the entire city.
Bei'er: Great, everyone's happy. You're good, we're good. However...
Crafty: These two... They don't look anything like us.
Paimon: It'll be fine. When we're in disguise, no-one will be the wiser.
Bei'er: It still seems like a long shot to me, but... with the help of an adeptus, hopefully everything will turn out fine...
Crafty: Well, the safety of Liyue is in your hands now. Good luck — even the Treasure Hoarders don't want to see the city burned to the ground.
Traveler: Wait!
Xiao: Then it is settled.
Traveler: Next time we meet...
Xiao: *sigh* What is it?
Traveler: Let's make it somewhere with a view of the Mingxiao Lantern.
Xiao: Huh?
Xiao: ...I am not partial to crowded areas. Especially at this time of the year.
Xiao: When this matter is resolved... come to Wangshu Inn.
Traveler: Huh!? Wait...
Xiao: In previous years, the Mingxiao Lantern has been visible even from there.
Paimon: He's... vanished. Did he go back to Wangshu Inn already...?
Paimon: But the time mentioned in the letter, that's today, isn't it?
Paimon: Come on, let's go to the <color=#00E1FFFF>meeting place</color>.
Xiao: ...Understood. I shall await your news there.

## Talk 14

???: Alright, you folks from the Treasure Hoarders, yeah? I thought I insinuated in my letter there that you should have done like I done and put on a mask and a costume and so forth...
???: ...But it seems you didn't all get the memo. Hehehe... it's pretty cool though... gutsy.
Paimon: Hmph! Well guess what? We don't need to go sneaking around everywhere wearing disguises! Because unlike you, we would never do anything so shameful that we would need to wear masks while doing it!
Paimon: Really!? I was in the middle of my speech and everything!
Traveler: I think he just enjoys dressing up...
???: Wait a second now... You folks ain't no Treasure Hoarders! What game are you two playing!?
Traveler: This get up is pretty cool, though...

## Talk 15

Paimon: Tell us your diabolical plan, now! It's over, buster!
???: Okay! I give up!
Paimon: Give up now or feel the wrath of my Paimonial... Huh? You're giving up just like that?
???: I, uh... I'm just a lowly apprentice thief who really looks up to the Treasure Hoarders...
Paimon: An apprentice thief!?
???: Yeah... For a greenhorn like me, 'specially working on my own an' all... The Treasure Hoarders? Man, they're my heroes...
Paimon: Wait a second, so—
???: ...So, I thought I'd try and set up some sorta lucrative opportunity, then submit my pledge of loyalty...
Paimon: Wait a second! None of this is making any sense!
Paimon: Paimon was expecting a serial arsonist to be someone more... sinister! Evil-looking! But instead... We get you!?
???: ...Arson? What the heck are you talking about?
Paimon: Don't pretend! Paimon's seen you, loitering around piles of highly flammable materials!
???: Oh... Oh yeah, yeah, I know where you're talkin' about. But I was only checking the place out.
???: My plan ain't got nothing to do with those lantern construction materials.
Paimon: ...Are you serious!?
???: I just wanted to nab me the biggest chunk of Plaustrite in twenty years is all...
???: I was gonna wait till nightfall, chop off half the tethers, float it out to sea...
Paimon: Oh...
???: Then all I'd have to do is find some way or another of bringing it down, so I could hide it underwater in the shallows. The perfect crime!
Paimon: Uhh, for a perfect crime, it sure has a lot of holes... For example, how exactly were you planning to bring down the Plaustrite once it was airborne?
???: I was still in the process of figuring out the details, hence why I hadn't made my move yet.
Paimon: This guy is an imbecile!
Paimon: #Okay, {NICKNAME}, let's teach him a lesson.
Paimon: Now that the Millelith have gotten hold of that idiot...
Paimon: Let's head back. We can notify the <color=#00E1FFFF>Ministry of Civil Affairs</color>.

## Talk 16

Jiayi: Traveler, word spreads fast! We will keep watch over the thief, thanks for your help.
Jiayi: Looks like the Mingxiao Lantern will be ready soon. A critical juncture, we cannot afford the slightest interference.
Traveler: On the topic of keeping Lantern Rite safe...
Jiayi: Rest easy, word was passed up the chain. Another group of very capable troops has been brought in.
Jiayi: They're dressed as ordinary citizens, you wouldn't notice them in the crowd. If anyone dares make a move, they'll be on them in an instant.
Jiayi: That's sorted then. You two get some rest, we'll take it from here. Enjoy Lantern Rite in peace!
Paimon: So... Paimon supposes that's taken care of, then.
Traveler: If only Xiao were here to see the Mingxiao Lantern.
Paimon: *sigh* Paimon wishes so too. Guess he won't make it this time.
Paimon: Wait, do you remember what the inspiration for the Mingxiao Lantern was?
Traveler: An adeptus...
Paimon: Yeah, with a name like... Skybracer, or something.
Paimon: So if it's modeled on an adeptus, maybe Xiao would be interested this time?
Paimon: On the day the Mingxiao Lantern is ready, we can meet him at <color=#00E1FFFF>Wangshu Inn</color> like he suggested, then try to persuade him.
Paimon: Even though he said you can see the Mingxiao Lantern from Wangshu Inn... We should get up close if we wanna get that festival atmosphere.
Traveler: Skybracer sounds right...

### Additional Talk 5

Wang'ya: <color=#00E1FFFF>Azurite</color> is occasionally found in the northern part of Mt. Tianheng.
Wang'ya: It is said that when Azurite gets caught in the roots of ordinary vegetation, it sometimes produces <color=#00E1FFFF>Bloatty Floatties</color>, which have floating seeds.
Wang'ya: Perhaps you can start by tracking down <color=#00E1FFFF>Bloatty Floatties</color>. They might lead you to <color=#00E1FFFF>Azurite</color> deposits.
Wang'ya: And then you can check out Guili Plains, where old <color=#00E1FFFF>Ruin Hunters</color> who have lost the power of flight use <color=#00E1FFFF>Vermillionite</color> to keep themselves airborne.
Wang'ya: Don't go looking for Ruin Hunters unprepared, though. They can be quite deadly.

### Additional Talk 6

Changchang: Why does it have to be so hard? I'll never learn how to make a Xiao Lantern...
