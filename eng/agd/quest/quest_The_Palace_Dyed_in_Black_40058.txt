# The Palace, Dyed in Black


## Talk 1

Paimon: Kazuha said he would wait for us at The Five Kasen Plaza today. Let's go find him there.

## Talk 2

Kaedehara Kazuha: Everyone, I've found something that you should all have a look at.
Paimon: Oh! Seems Kazuha discovered something, let's go see what he's got!

## Talk 3

Kujou Sara: Hmm? What are you all doing here? Did something happen on Ritou?
Traveler: Nothing's happened, Sara.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Kujou Sara, perhaps you still remember me?
Kujou Sara: Yes, I do. You're Kaedehara Kazuha, a wanted criminal during the Vision Hunt Decree. However, your arrest warrant has since been repealed.
Paimon: Sara, we'd like to ask about the Kaedehara Clan's property that was seized by the Tenryou Commission. Do you know where all their belongings are now?
Kujou Sara: Yes, the items seized at that time are currently stored in the warehouse next to the Police Station. Since Kaedehara has come back to Inazuma, those items should be returned to their rightful owner.
Kaedehara Kazuha: No, I'm afraid you misunderstand. I'm not here to reclaim those belongings. I just want to investigate them for a personal matter.
Kujou Sara: I see. Alright, I'll inform the Police Station. They'll take you into the warehouse.
Paimon: Thank you, Sara!
Kujou Sara: Ahem... Kaedehara, about the Vision Hunt Decree...
Kaedehara Kazuha: That's all in the past now, Kujou Sara. There's no need to mention it again. I know you've also had your own convictions and struggles.
Kujou Sara: ...
Kaedehara Kazuha: However, may I ask something of you?
Kujou Sara: Yes, what is it?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Currently, I have no plans to stay in Inazuma. As a result, those items from my family's estate are of no use to me.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Madam Kujou, I believe you're a person of integrity. After our investigation is over, I'd like to ask if you can handle those belongings for me. Please, sell them and use the money to help the poor.
Kujou Sara: Alright, I understand. I'll be sure to take care of it.
Traveler: We're just here to ask about something.

## Talk 4

Asakawa: You must be here to investigate the Kaedehara Clan's belongings. Madam Kujou has already informed me of the situation. Please, come this way.

## Talk 5

Asakawa: The Kaedehara Clan's belongings are stored in this warehouse. Unfortunately, the items are scattered throughout in order to save space. My deepest apologies.
Asakawa: However, I have clearly marked the corresponding items, so they shouldn't be too difficult to find.
Asakawa: I'll be waiting for you at the door, please come see me if you require any assistance.
Xingqiu: Kazuha, since the items are scattered throughout the building, I propose we split up and look for clues.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, sounds like a plan. Thanks for your help, everyone.

## Talk 6

Kaedehara Kazuha: This flowerpot was in my house for a long time. I heard that it was left behind by my great-grandfather.
Paimon: Yeah, the plants seem to have been dead for a while now.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Well, after my great-grandfather stopped studying the forging arts, he picked up the hobby of keeping bonsai plants. Most of his prized plants were given to others once he became seriously ill.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But he specifically left behind this dead plant at the time, and even instructed my grandfather not to throw it away in his will.
Kaedehara Kazuha: My grandfather deeply regretted that he never managed to reconcile with my great-grandfather, so he left the plant exactly as it was.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But now that I think about it, my great-grandfather could very well have left it behind for other reasons.
Paimon: Hmm, now that you mention it, this flower pot is kinda suspicious.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes. Let's take a closer look, shall we?
Black Screen Text: They find a hidden compartment at the bottom of the flowerpot...
Paimon: We finally found something! Huh, it's only a bunch of blank paper.
Paimon: Do you think someone already discovered the compartment and swapped the contents?
Albedo: No, I do not think that is the case here. See the paper? It's quite yellowed, which means it's very old.
Traveler: Maybe we need to try using water again.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm. You mean to say that these sheets have been written with special ink, like that which Miss Kamisato found before?
Albedo: Yes, I agree with this hypothesis.
Paimon: Okay, let's give it a dunk then!
Kaedehara Kazuha: There is a pond outside the Police Station. I'll use the water there.

## Talk 7

Kaedehara Kazuha: ...
Paimon: Well? How did it go? Those weren't just plain old sheets of paper, were they?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Just as everyone guessed, after I sprinkled some water onto the paper, writing did indeed begin to appear on it. It is a letter written by my great-grandfather.
Paimon: Oh, what does the letter say?
Traveler: Is it something you can share with us, too?
Kaedehara Kazuha: It is. I'll tell you what my great-grandfather knew at the time. But before that, I wish to take you somewhere.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Everyone, please follow me.

## Talk 8

Kamisato Ayaka: Kaedehara, why did you lead us to this beach?
Traveler: Is this place related to the contents of the letter?
Kaedehara Kazuha: It is... In fact, my great-grandfather and the head of the Kamisato Clan tracked the fleeing swordsmiths to this very location.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Our hypothesis was correct. My great-grandfather was well aware of the truth behind the defective blades. And it was right here where they encountered the culprit who framed the Kaedehara Clan and the Raiden Gokaden.
Kaedehara Kazuha: It reads:
Kaedehara Kazuha: "To whoever reads this letter: I, Kaedehara Yoshinori, have been held to a certain secret throughout my entire life. I don't have much longer in this world, and after much consideration, I've finally decided to disclose the matter."
Kaedehara Kazuha: "All those years ago, when I was pursuing the swordsmiths alongside Commissioner Kamisato of the Yashiro Commission, I was not injured by one of the fleeing smiths. Rather..."
Kaedehara Yoshinori: ...It was night, and after the clues led us down to shore, I waited for the culprits to show themselves. However, there were no swordsmiths in sight, only a single eccentric stranger.
Kaedehara Yoshinori: This stranger claimed to be the one behind the failed forgings and said that he had been patiently waiting for us. He then threatened to destroy the Raiden Gokaden.
Kaedehara Yoshinori: That person was of able body, and in a blink of an eye, myself and the accompanying samurai had been defeated.
Kaedehara Yoshinori: Commissioner Kamisato was severely wounded, and I barely escaped death myself. My hat had fortunately blunted a blow to my head.
Kaedehara Yoshinori: The unusual stranger could've easily claimed my life at that moment. But, after noticing my appearance, he stopped his attacks, and sternly asked if I had any connection with the name "Niwa."
Kaedehara Yoshinori: I answered that it was my father's surname and after my father disappeared, I was adopted by the Kaedehara family.
Kaedehara Yoshinori: Upon hearing my answer, the stranger paused. After a long silence, he suddenly said: "Tell her this. My name is Kunikuzushi." He then turned and left...

## Talk 9

Kaedehara Yoshinori: ...It was night, and after the clues led us down to shore, I waited for the culprits to show themselves. However, there were no swordsmiths in sight, only a single eccentric stranger.
Kaedehara Yoshinori: This stranger claimed to be the one behind the failed forgings and said that he had been patiently waiting for us. He then threatened to destroy the Raiden Gokaden.
Kaedehara Yoshinori: That person was of able body, and in a blink of an eye, myself and the accompanying samurai had been defeated.
Kaedehara Yoshinori: Commissioner Kamisato was severely wounded, and I barely escaped death myself. My hat had fortunately blunted a blow to my head.
Kaedehara Yoshinori: The unusual stranger could've easily claimed my life at that moment. But, after noticing my appearance, he stopped his attacks, and sternly asked if I had any connection with the name "Niwa."
Kaedehara Yoshinori: I answered that it was my father's surname and after my father disappeared, I was adopted by the Kaedehara family.
Kaedehara Yoshinori: Upon hearing my answer, the stranger paused. After a long silence, he suddenly said: "Tell her this. My name is Kunikuzushi." He then turned and left...

## Talk 10

Paimon: Wow, so that's what really happened!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes. My great-grandfather and the head of the Kamisato Clan escaped from death and learned that the forging diagram had been tampered with by Kunikuzushi.
Kaedehara Kazuha: However, due to the encounter, the head of the Kamisato Clan was worried that my great-grandfather would be falsely accused of being involved with the perpetrator. So even on his deathbed, the master of the Kamisato Clan cautioned my great-grandfather to never speak of what happened.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Because the perpetrator said he would destroy the Raiden Gokaden, my great-grandfather worried that the perpetrator would still return for vengeance. So, to protect his loved ones, he closed the family business.
Kaedehara Kazuha: He said: "As the leader of the Kaedehara Clan, I am deeply ashamed to witness the decline of the Isshin Art. But, as a father, it is my priority to ensure the safety of my children and grandchildren."
Traveler: So all those harsh words he said...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, that's right. If my grandpa had somehow discovered the secret behind the tampered diagram all those years ago, perhaps my great-grandfather would've told him the truth.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Unfortunately, he failed to catch any of the hints in my great-grandfather's words.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Miss Kamisato, it appears you were unaware of the happenings that my great-grandfather described here. What are your thoughts?
Kamisato Ayaka: Hmm, I suppose the reason the head of the Kamisato House never spoke of this to the family was due to similar safety concerns.
Kamisato Ayaka: If the perpetrator was capable of tampering with even the Shogun's diagrams, and could single-handedly defeat many men, then he is not an ordinary enemy.
Kamisato Ayaka: I will discuss this matter with brother shortly and investigate the identity behind the one called "Kunikuzushi." Rest assured, we will act cautiously.
Traveler: How are you feeling, Kazuha?
Kaedehara Kazuha: To be honest, as I read the letter, I felt much turbulence in my heart. But now, I've managed to calm myself.
Kaedehara Kazuha: My great-grandfather said in the letter that he did not wish his descendants to blindly seek revenge and be deceived by things of the past.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Though he was in a tight situation when he wrote these words, I feel like they are still valid nonetheless.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I think what's most important for each person is not the past, but the present. Even though we must carry the burdens from the past, there are also things we wish to strive for.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Therefore, knowing the truth behind what happened is enough for me. I will live on just as my great-grandfather had hoped.
Kaedehara Kazuha: That being said, if the enemy from all those years ago is still lurking and plotting to stir up more trouble, then I definitely won't turn a blind eye.
Traveler: That's Kazuha, always sensible.
Kaedehara Kazuha: These are simply insights I've gathered from all that I've experienced.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Thank you all for accompanying me in my search for the truth behind that incident.
Paimon: Great! Now that we're done here, let's head back to Ritou.
Traveler: Classic Kazuha, optimistic as always.
Traveler: Were because he was worried about his son's well-being.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Kujou Sara: I've already informed the Police Station. There'll be someone to take you into the warehouse, so you may head there directly.
Kujou Sara: As for all the belongings left by the Kaedehara Clan, I will deal with them promptly.

### Additional Talk 2

Kamisato Ayaka: Hmm...
Traveler: Ayaka, how's it going for you?
Kamisato Ayaka: #Oh, it's you, Traveler. I'm currently investigating this sword rack.
Paimon: Oh, since the Kaedehara Clan was a family of renowned swordsmiths, then this blade should be super valuable, right? *gasp* Maybe it's a treasure of the Isshin Art!?
Kamisato Ayaka: I'm afraid not. Although the sword rack is made of fine wood, the swords placed here appear to be quite ordinary. Due to the dire financial situation of the late Kaedehara Clan, everything of value has probably been sold off already.
Kamisato Ayaka: The blade on this sword hasn't been sharpened, but there are many signs of use on the hilt. Perhaps Kaedehara used it for training as a child.
Paimon: Let Paimon see... Oh, there seems to be a couple uneven characters etched into the scabbard! "Kazu"... "ha." Wow, so it really was Kazuha's!
Paimon: Paimon can imagine what Kazuha was like as a kid, hehe.
Kamisato Ayaka: I will continue investigating here and call you if I find anything interesting.

### Additional Talk 3

Paimon: What did you find, Xingqiu?
Xingqiu: I've found quite the pile of old books.
Xingqiu: These books here are all related to smelting steel, and these are about the process of forging blades. This pile over here is all about plants and flowers.
Paimon: Hmm, the books about plants and flowers must have belonged to Kazuha's great-grandfather.
Traveler: Could there be any clues in the books?
Xingqiu: I skimmed through them just now, but I didn't find anything particularly worth noting. I shall take a closer look and let you know if I find anything.

### Additional Talk 4

Kaedehara Kazuha: I'll be checking around here. You and the others can start looking elsewhere.

### Additional Talk 5

Albedo: Oh, it's you. Unfortunately, I have yet to find anything of value here.
Paimon: Whoa, this folding screen looks pretty old, though.
Albedo: Yes. Perhaps if it were better maintained, then it could fetch a decent price. However, I doubt it could be sold in its current condition.
Albedo: I was taking a closer look just now and noticed a large piece of dirt caught in the fabric fibers on the backside.
Albedo: The soil is deeply embedded into the cloth. That means a great deal of force was used when the dirt was lodged into the cloth. It's likely that this patch of dirt is from the very flower pot thrown by Kazuha's grandfather.
Traveler: Isn't that an important discovery?
Albedo: Because this is not what we are looking for now.
Albedo: Let me think... If I wanted to leave a message behind, I would probably choose to leave it on something a little more special. Hmm...
Paimon: Albedo seems to be thinking pretty hard, we'd better not bother him.
Traveler: Why don't you think this is of any value?

### Additional Talk 6

Asakawa: Sorry, many of the items were moved here recently, so things are still a bit unorganized.
Asakawa: Although the previous warehouse was large, the locks were dated, and something was nearly stolen. So, Madam Kujou Sara ordered the contents to be moved here.

### Additional Talk 7

Venti: Hmm, there must be some around here somewhere...
Traveler: What are you looking for, Venti?
Venti: Do you see all these pots here? Some of them are bound to have liquor inside, right?
Paimon: Hey! Everyone else is trying hard to help and you're over here looking for a drink!?
Venti: Haha, I merely jest, of course. C'mon, we're close to uncovering the truth now, why do you look so worried?
Paimon: Well, Paimon doesn't really get why Kazuha told Sara to sell all these belongings...
Paimon: What if we don't end up finding anything today? Then wouldn't Kazuha lose the chance of finding out what really happened all those years ago? ...Y'know, just saying.
Venti: I know you are worried about Kazuha, but if you ask me, he is stronger than you think.
Venti: Since Kazuha made such a request to Sara, that indicates he's already made his choice. Whether we find out the truth or not today, or whatever it turns out to be, he's ready to accept it.
Traveler: Is this your archon's intuition speaking?
Venti: No, not intuition. Rather, I've lived for a long time now, so you could say I have some experience in reading people.
Venti: Leave the things here to me, you two can look around elsewhere.
