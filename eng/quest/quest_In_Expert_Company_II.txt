# In Expert Company? (II)


## Talk 1

Ms. Qiu: *sigh* I hope the films won't be damaged by the water.
Yifeng: Don't worry Boss, the box is sealed tight. The water won't be getting in.
Xingye: Good thing our Film Kamera didn't fall in. Otherwise, it would be a total flop...

## Talk 2

Ms. Qiu: #Aha! You're the best, {NICKNAME}. You're the absolute best!
Ms. Qiu: If it weren't for you, everything inside the case would have been lost.
Ms. Qiu: We need to get back to the city and give these films to Mr. Geisert.
Ms. Qiu: #And then... let's have a meal together. {NICKNAME}, if you're interested, you can come too.
Ms. Qiu: After we finish eating, I'll pay you your reward.
Traveler: Alright.
Ms. Qiu: Alright! It's settled.
Ms. Qiu: Yifeng, bring the films in this box over to Mr. Geisert later.
Ms. Qiu: Xingye, go get some good greens from nearby. I've been practicing my Poisson Seafood Soup, and it's time to show it off to Mr. Geisert.
Xingye: Boss, we're already going to the restaurant. Why do you still get to do things yourself?
Ms. Qiu: So that we can save costs...
Ms. Qiu: Ahem! It's settled. Let's get going.
Ms. Qiu: #{NICKNAME}, you can follow me.
Traveler: Well, I just happen to be hungry.

## Talk 3

Ms. Qiu: This pot is pretty strange. Hmm... but it should be used the same way as the ones in Liyue.
Xingye: Boss, I got the veggies, but they're all out of Marcotte.
Xingye: I couldn't find any other store that sells it...
Ms. Qiu: #That's... the last ingredient we needed. Well, uh, {NICKNAME}...
Traveler: I'll go fetch it.
Ms. Qiu: Thanks for your help. Don't worry, I know how adventurers work. This isn't a free favor.
Traveler: Include this with the payment.

## Talk 4

Ms. Qiu: #{NICKNAME}, did you get the Marcotte?
Traveler: I got it.

## Talk 5

Ms. Qiu: #{NICKNAME}, I'd like to introduce you to a master filmmaker, Mr. Geisert.
Ms. Qiu: #Mr. Geisert, this is {NICKNAME}, a highly skilled adventurer.
Ms. Qiu: #If you plan to shoot an action film in the future, you should definitely consider casting {NICKNAME} as the lead!
Geisert: Haha, Ms. Qiu exaggerates. I'm not some filmmaking expert.
Geisert: I'm just someone who's somewhat familiar with the uses of lighting for filmmaking.
Ms. Qiu: Ah, you're too modest. The lighting in your films practically speaks for itself.
Traveler: Uses of lighting for filmmaking?
Geisert: Yeah. In my lighting theory, I believe that the manipulation of lighting is the manipulation of emotion.
Geisert: But... how should I put this... My theories have yet to be regarded in Fontaine's film industry.
Geisert: Most directors prefer to use direct movement or the scene itself to illustrate their stories.
Geisert: I've shot a few films purely using lighting transitions to express narrative, but almost no one was interested.
Geisert: But now, at least one director thinks my lighting theory has value.
Ms. Qiu: Director? Me? Hahaha, don't jest. I was just a tea vendor.
Geisert: Who said a tea vendor can't be a director? I was just a journalist before.
Ms. Qiu: A journalist... Then you must be good at writing reports? Just like those in the papers.
Geisert: I suppose. What about it?
Ms. Qiu: Huh... Just as well...
Ms. Qiu: Ah! Nothing, nothing. Let's eat! We will have plenty of time to work together in the future, hahaha!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): Everyone takes a seat to Ms. Qiu's forthright laughter.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): After the meal, Ms. Qiu makes an additional meal and stuffs it in your bag after packaging it...
Traveler: Is lighting very important in filmmaking?
Geisert: Of course. In my theories, lighting is the key way mood is expressed in a scene.

## Talk 6

Ms. Qiu: Okay, gotta get this meal started as soon as possible. Gotta do this fast. Mr. Geisert is almost here...

## Talk 7

Ms. Qiu: No problem. Our box is waterproof. All we need to do is dive down and fetch it...
Xingye: Boss, none of us here knows how to dive.
Yifeng: I know how to swim, but diving's beyond me.
Ms. Qiu: Is... is the commission we posted at the Adventurers' Guild still on the board?
Yifeng: Boss, didn't you say before that we should hurry up and take the commission down?
Xingye: We did that yesterday. The guild said they can return us our prepaid commission posting fee today.
Ms. Qiu: Uh... If we want to send out a commission again, are we going to need to pay an additional service fee...
Traveler: Have you guys finished your film?
Ms. Qiu: #Adventurer... {NICKNAME}! You came right when we needed you!
Ms. Qiu: Can you dive? Or... can you help me find a diver with the ability and time to do a dive?
Traveler: You want to... do an underwater shoot?
Yifeng: We're hardly that capable. We also can't afford water-proof film equipment.
Xingye: It's purely because the box we put our films in fell into the water.
Ms. Qiu: #Alright, that's enough you two! {NICKNAME}, you gotta help us.
Ms. Qiu: Don't worry about the payment. I'll pay you upfront, just like last time.
Traveler: What are you guys doing here?
