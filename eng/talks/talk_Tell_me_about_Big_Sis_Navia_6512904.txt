Traveler: Tell me about Big Sis Navia...
Cava: She's the one the adults call the Boss.
Cava: But that sounds super serious. Makes her sound like some old guy smacking tables and yelling at people — that doesn't seem like Navia at all!
Cava: Whenever she's around, the town's a super lively place. Even the grown-ups laugh and are happy.
Cava: Sometimes she even brings some amazing clockwork toys back for Granny Yvette to look at.
Cava: The look on Granny's face when she sees them — y'know, the kind people have when they want to say something but hold back? It's pretty funny.
