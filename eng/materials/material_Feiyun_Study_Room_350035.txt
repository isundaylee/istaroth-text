# Feiyun Study Room

A detailed step-by-step blueprint for making a "Feiyun Study Room."
There are many ways to fashion a study in Liyue, but luxury is optional, for the learned prefer "spirit" and "elegance." A potted plant here balances out the moisture in the room, and the table and shelves exude a light woody fragrance that combines with the plain layout and the sunset glow of the lamps to inspire genius and elevate writing.
They say that many years ago, a certain guest at Feiyun Slope laid just such a study out, and this design was taken up by the previous boss of Wanwen Bookhouse. Thus, it was ever after known as the Feiyun Study Room and became recognized throughout Liyue.
