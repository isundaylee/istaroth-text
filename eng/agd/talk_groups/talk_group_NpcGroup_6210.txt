Yolotli: Hello, hello... Did Mr. Toltec ask you to come find me?

Traveler: Nope.
Yolotli: Huh... I see...
Yolotli: Did I seem a bit nervous to you? Yeah, sorry about that.
Yolotli: Thing is, a message from Mr. Toltec often means a new commission to investigate the Ley Lines. But I'm afraid I'm not ready to go out there again quite yet.
Yolotli: There are many mystical arts that need learning, and materials that must be prepared in advance...
Yolotli: My Ley Line perception is mediocre, so I need Saurian help for that — and Iktomisaurs aren't the type to just go out for walkies with humans.

Traveler: I'll leave you to it then.

Traveler: Do you need to prepare lots of gifts?
Yolotli: No no, actually the opposite, really...
Yolotli: Above all else, Iktomisaurs despise it when other creatures try to use their abilities for selfish gain. They won't be so easily bribed.
Yolotli: Before inviting them, you must follow their etiquette and state the purpose for which you require their help.
Yolotli: But they're sharp-eyed as all get-out, so there's no point trying to fool them.

Traveler: What if it's a gift given without expecting anything in return?
Yolotli: Well... that depends on how much the Iktomisaurus trusts you.
Yolotli: After all, there's no such thing as a free lunch. The less is asked in returned for a gift, the more suspicious it is.
Yolotli: Want to give it a try? Well, I've heard the Iktomisaurs love these mushrooms, so good luck.
