# Blocked?


## Talk 1

Panicked Myrana: H—Help me! Please!

## Talk 2

Panicked Myrana: Th—Thank you, Traveler...
Panicked Myrana: *sigh* First monsters, now this roadblock... It's hectic enough already back home, there was me thinking this would be a chance to get away from it all for a while!
Panicked Myrana: I'm sorry, but is there any chance you could sort out this roadblock situation for me?
Traveler: Okay.
Panicked Myrana: Thank you! I hope my two young ones grow up to be kind like you.
Traveler: I have other things to do.
Panicked Myrana: Come on, please... I promise it won't take you too long.

## Talk 3

Panicked Myrana: Th—Thanks so much, Traveler.
Panicked Myrana: But please, don't tell anybody I got myself into trouble. My husband will give me an earful if he finds out...
Panicked Myrana: Don't look at me like that... Wait till you're married, you'll see. A solitary stroll is a huge luxury when you're living with someone, you've got to make the most of it.
Panicked Myrana: Here, take this. I picked some while I was out. Much cheaper to cook for yourself than eat at Good Hunter! You have to scrimp and save if you want to get by.
