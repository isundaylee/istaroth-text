# Wangshu Take-Away


## Talk 1

Traveler: Sorry, I'm busy at the moment.
Smiley Yanxiao: Huh, still busy, are you? Well then, guess I need to look for someone else.

## Talk 2

Traveler: Sure, I'll deliver it.
Smiley Yanxiao: Aye. Be about it, then.

## Talk 3

Tacit Tingfang: Any moment now.

## Talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: That fellow Tingfang ordered some Black-Back Perch Stew. He should have headed off to Qingce Village by now.
Smiley Yanxiao: This Black-Back Perch Stew has had greater emphasis placed on the quality of its soup. So you <color=#00E1FFFF>can't fly or climb all over the place</color>, or you'll spill it for sure. You'll want to make the delivery quick, too.
Smiley Yanxiao: If you meet with an accident along the way, come back here and I'll make you another serving.
