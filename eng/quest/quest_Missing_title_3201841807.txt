# Missing title (3201841807)


## Talk 1

Cimest: Your Excellencies. I welcome you on behalf of the Kingdom of Breezes and Bells.
Traveler: What will you do next?
Cimest: Hmm... Well, first, I shall announce to all the people that the relic has passed judgment.
Cimest: And that the Guardian... will be Mr. Faurobert, who has come here from afar.
Paimon: Huh!? Why would you do that?
Cimest: Trying to explain everything we've been through would be far too complicated.
Cimest: Besides, it would take too long for them to grasp the concept of me being both a princess and a Guardian at the same time.
Cimest: When the time is right, I will make a detailed record of all that happened and then inform my people in writing.
Cimest: But until then, I will still preside over all the affairs of the kingdom as its "Princess."
Cimest: Once those "trial grounds" have been officially converted into "training grounds," I will set off.
Traveler: Set off?
Faurobert: Your Highness, do you still remember... Who the relic actually lit up for back in the cave?
Cimest: Hmm? Who it... actually lit up for?
Faurobert: Yes, as we were both next to it at the time. Of course, Your Highness fully deserves to be acknowledged, but I on the other hand... I...
Traveler: You're a champion who's been acknowledged by a champion.
Paimon: Exactly, and that champion came specifically to ask for your help! How could you possibly still think you're unworthy?
Faurobert: *sigh* Maybe it's simply that you shine so brightly, Your Highness, that everyone was mistaken...
Cimest: Pfft... Well then, Mr. Champion, would you be willing to undergo another trial?
Cimest: I, Princess Cimest of the Kingdom of Breezes and Bells, shall personally bear witness to your deeds with this relic.
Faurobert: Of course! I do, I do, I do!
Traveler: Hold your horses...
Paimon: He gets so excited whenever he hears the princess's name. Hehe, Faurobert...
Faurobert: Don't get me wrong! I—I'm doing this to fulfill the calling of Rainsong Pond! All that training I did, it was all to save... Uhh, I mean, protect Her Highness.
Faurobert: And it's such an important task, so naturally I must ensure that it all goes without a hitch...
Traveler: Are you willing to travel together with Her Highness?
Faurobert: I—I am...
Cimest: Hehe, that's good to hear. Well then, Mr. "Champion" Faurobert, are you ready for my trial?
Faurobert: I am, Your Highness! Whenever you're ready, I'm ready!
Paimon: Whoa! The relic's lit up again, and it's super bright this time!
Traveler: My ears... It burns!
Traveler: What are you going to do?

## Talk 2

Faurobert: Estampe! Where have you been!?
Estampe: Uhh, actually, I was strolling about the area, and had a go at that trial. It was fun, but I had to adopt a slightly different approach to pass it.
Estampe: Mr. Horellou has filled me in on everything that has happened to you. Not bad, Mr. Guardian. Turns out you're pretty talented after all, eh?
Faurobert: Y—Y—You... If you'd been standing next to me, I'd have pushed you off, I tell you! I'd have pushed you off ten times if I had the chance!
Estampe: Hence why I decided to take part in the trial instead. Faurobert, my friend, I always believed you could do it. And look... You did it!
Horellou: Hahaha, you're jolly good fellows, the both of you. Today is an auspicious day for our pond!
Horellou: Finally, we have a true champion. Though Mr. Faurobert hasn't saved a princess yet, I believe that his chance will come.
Faurobert: *sigh* But I really didn't do anything, Mr. Horellou, other than standing by and watching as Her Highness did all the heavy lifting...
Horellou: Isn't that even better? Surely you didn't want the princess to be in danger?
Faurobert: I... Uh...
Horellou: Ahh, that's quite enough, Mr. Faurobert. You were entrusted to fulfill the calling by Cibrelus himself!
Faurobert: Oh, pish posh! I'm not even sure if it was Cibrelus! After all, I've only ever heard of him, never heard him speak!
Estampe: And you even accepted the princess's trial. You're a champion if ever there was one.
Faurobert: Can we just... Not talk about this for now? Please...
Horellou: Anyway, to sum up — the future of Rainsong Pond is now in your capable hands!
Horellou: Now, we can simply enjoy jumping for jumping's own sake! When I get back, I'll suggest to the committee that we make "fun" the focus going forward!
Estampe: That sounds like a proposal I'd be willing to get behind. On that note, let's head back.
Faurobert: Hey, don't leave me here!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Saborn: Both you and that paper frog were acknowledged as Guardians, Your Highness!?
Souffache: Unbelievable, unheard of! There is simply no precedent for this!
Saborn: And you'll have to make changes to the trial too... No, don't do this, Your Highness!
Souffache: You can't simply overhaul such an ancient tradition on a whim, Your Highness!
Cimest: Alright, alright, keep your voices down. My ears are starting to hurt...
Cimest: It's all been decided already. Now, given that I am both a princess and a Guardian who has been acknowledged by the relic, you're in even less of a position to stop me.
Saborn: But, Your Highness...
Cimest: The both of you may relax. I'll host a ceremony to train up hosts of reliable flying squirrels to defend the kingdom.
Cimest: Only after that will I leave the kingdom.
Souffache: Your Highness, we... *sigh* You...
Cimest: Don't worry, you two. I can take care of myself.
Cimest: As the princess, in the end it is I who shall face the wild winds of the world on my own.
Saborn: ...As you wish, Your Highness.
