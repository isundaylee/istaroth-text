Traveler: Who are you...
Furuta: Don't mistake me for just another old lady. I once served and attended to the Lady Guuji herself...
Furuta: My old friend Nakanishi and I had been serving for the Kamisato Clan since the former Commissioner was in office.
Furuta: As we got older, our bodies became less nimble than before, so we retired.
Furuta: As for me... thanks to Miss Kamisato's graciousness, I can still be a housekeeper in this mansion. I can do some chores and take care of youngsters like Koharu. Hehe.
Furuta: I really wish Koharu would learn housekeeping from Thoma more. Then, I could really relax...

Traveler: Housekeeping?
Furuta: Indeed, and the most capable housekeeper in this mansion would be Thoma.
Furuta: Whether it is trimming the courtyard, collecting furnishings, cooking, or sewing, Thoma can do them all nicely and quickly.
Furuta: It's almost a shame that he also needs to serve the Commissioner and Miss Kamisato, so he can't take care of everything.
Furuta: As long he is around, the Kamisato Clan has no need of servants. Hahaha...

Traveler: You must've been very skilled before.
Furuta: Hahaha, you praise me excessively. Right now, I'm nothing more than a servant of the Kamisato Clan. At best, I had some experience when I was still young...
Furuta: ...How about I give this to you. As you have no place to call home, some experience from this elderly servant may be of use to you.
