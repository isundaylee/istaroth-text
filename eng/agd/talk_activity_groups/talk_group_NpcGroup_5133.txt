Augereau: Hello. Do you need any help?

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me a bit about yourself...
Augereau: I'm a member of the Gardes in charge of keeping Romaritime Harbor safe. Feel free to call for me if you encounter any trouble.
Augereau: I've got a good pair of eyes and a quick pair of legs, so any suspect who wishes to escape outside our borders will have to pass me first.
Augereau: Haha, just kidding. I exaggerate, somewhat.
Augereau: People come and go all around this place, but most of the work is done by machines â€” everything's pretty well organized.

## Talk

Traveler: Could you tell me about the "prophecy"?
Augereau: Well, I've always been for believing in such mysterious things.
Augereau: And as a result, I've found myself saddled with conflicting rumors. If I were to become too obsessed with them, I'll be stuck with a troubled life... for life, you know?
Augereau: So yeah, I think you can believe in such things, but there's no point thinking too hard about them. I'm just an ordinary person without much ambition to change fate.
Augereau: So whichever of the rumors turns out to be true, I'll be fine with it.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Augereau: Take care of yourself, and stay safe.

## Talk

Traveler: About the prophecy...
Augereau: I never thought the prophecy would actually come true! Although, it didn't turn out quite as expected...
Augereau: Can't really say I'm disappointed though, more like happy! After all, even if the flood caused some trouble, we Fontainians didn't really dissolve.
Augereau: Palais Mermonia had arranged an emergency plan before disaster struck, so we escaped the worst, thank goodness.
