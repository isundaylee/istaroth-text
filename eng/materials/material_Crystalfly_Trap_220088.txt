# Crystalfly Trap

A Crystalfly Trap, developed by a senior researcher named Fawitzki from Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering.
After being properly deployed and inserting the required materials, this device will start working and lure Crystalflies inside.
Fawitzki once led research on "Low-Temperature Lighting Devices," which required a large amount of Crystal Cores as research materials, which led to the development of the Crystalfly Trap.
However, the project was suspended for various reasons.
"We are here to commemorate the diligent Mr. Fawitzki. We sincerely hope that there are those who will carry on his research. The Institute will provide maximum support in any areas deemed appropriate."
