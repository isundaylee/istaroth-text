Traveler: Do you want to see a doctor?
Wanhu: True... That reminds me...
Wanhu: I got a prescription from Dr. Yiqing in Qiaoying Village once, and it alleviated the pain tremendously.
Wanhu: But according to the guys in the Secure Transport Agencies, I should seek help from Dr. Bai at Bubu Pharmacy if I want to be fully cured.
Wanhu: A guard once found himself with a bone-deep injury after losing to some monsters in the mountains, but it only took a few months for him to make a full recovery with Dr. Bai's medicine! It was like magic!
Wanhu: But it's an arduous journey from there to here for Dr. Bai's apprentice...
Wanhu: I think I'll just write a letter in advance. Once there are more patients here, she can deliver the medication in one go instead of suffering on my account!
