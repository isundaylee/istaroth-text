# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Do you have time for a chat?
Arataki Itto: *sigh*... Argh... where do I start...
Traveler: What's happened?
Arataki Itto: I've been doing some thinking over the last couple of days about how I keep losing my Onikabuto fights, and, well... I'm starting to think that maybe I should just give it up now.
Arataki Itto: Maybe it's time to make a clean break, you know? To stop wasting my time on things which just don't matter.
Traveler: You mean you're...
Arataki Itto: You bet — I'm giving up Onikabuto fights for good! From this day forward, it's Fireflies all the way, baby!
Traveler: Maybe the issue isn't about the bugs...
Arataki Itto: Not about the bugs... like how? Are you saying I should go for a boar instead? Or a bird maybe? Nah... too much hard work!
Arataki Itto: You do you have a point though — swapping out one kind of bug for another won't necessarily improve my odds of winning...
Arataki Itto: Anyway, whatever. At the end of the day, I just haven't found the bug for me. Ugh, seems like you can't go looking for a strong companion, you've gotta wait for the right one to come along...
Arataki Itto: Luckily for me, you're not like them at all: You and I are like an absolute powerhouse together!
Traveler: ...Also, I'm not a bug!!!
Arataki Itto: Hahaha, right, there's that too! I was just kidding, of course. My mind never even went there.
Arataki Itto: If we ever got into a situation where a fight was unavoidable, naturally I'd be the one to take it for the team.
Arataki Itto: All you'd have to do is stand back and root for me. At the top of your voice, you know, really giving it all you've got. When it comes to the atmosphere, you've gotta go big or go home!
Arataki Itto: Haha... All we're missing now is a catchy chant...
Arataki Itto: Ummm... Okay, okay, I think I got something: "Arataki Itto, the strongest in his class! Meet him on the street-o, he'll make you kiss his feet-o!"
Arataki Itto: Sound good? Haha. Alright, let's practice it together now!
Traveler: Maybe it's to do with the people you're playing with...
Arataki Itto: The people? Nah! No way. Not possible!
Arataki Itto: The kids I battle with might talk a whole lot, and sure, there's a few pranksters among them — but they're no cheaters!
