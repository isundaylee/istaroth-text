# Fully Furnished Mondstadt Bedroom

A detailed step-by-step blueprint for setting up a Fully Furnished Mondstadt Bedroom.
This is a standard-issue Mondstadt bedroom, with the furniture placement taking reference from that of the Knights of Favonius quarters.
As the Deaconess was praying over the wardrobe to ward off evil, the Knights also set an example by facing the wardrobe with the foot of their beds, claiming that they would give any ghostly rapscallions that should show up a hard knock on the head as a form of intimidation.
