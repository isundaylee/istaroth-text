# For a Dream I Tarry


## Talk 1

Paimon: Nothing here... Let's check the next tree.
Paimon: No, nothing. Maybe someone has taken it...
Paimon: Huh? There's actually a box here. Let's bring it back to him.

## Talk 2

Javi: Oh no. This isn't my Dream Box.
Traveler: We've got a box.
Javi: Haha... I've got one, too...
Javi: I even opened it, and found a piece of paper with Ami's name on it.
Javi: I remember that kid, the daughter of Jahangir, who was always found near the food shop.
Javi: So she dreamed of becoming a florist, who would care for a lot of flowers...
Javi: That was unexpected. I always thought Jahangir was gonna pass the shop to her.
Traveler: Let's see your dream first.
Javi: Oh! I almost forgot, I must take a look at my own dream first...
Javi: Lemme see...
Javi: "I hope to be a Vanara, and live in the forest forever..."
Javi: So that's my childhood dream? My goodness, I can't believe that's what I wished for...
Javi: Come on... Kiddo, being a Vanara won't pay you much.
Traveler: I don't see anything wrong with that.
Javi: That's just some childish ideas. For someone at my age, dreams...
Javi: ...
Javi: Better think about ways to get more Mora, and that's what gives some good sleep.
Javi: Enough about my boring dream, let's talk about Ami.
Javi: I should definitely do something to make amends to her since I opened her "Dream Box" without consent.
Javi: Well... Let me think, being a florist starts with learning how to plant flowers.
Javi: I happened to have a spare flower pot that I can give her.
Javi: Traveler, do you happen to know somewhere to get some flower seeds?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Javi: I'm counting on you for the seeds, Traveler. See you beside Jahangir's shop.
Traveler: Why are you doing this?
Javi: Hahaha... Let's just say I'm being spontaneous.
Javi: I will never realize my dream, because of all the years behind me, and... the fact that I don't actually care about the dream anymore.
Javi: But Ami is still young. She can still try to realize her dream.
Javi: As a boring adult, gifting her a flower pot is the least I can do. Hope that would show my support and encourage her.
Traveler: Dreams are never good or bad.
Traveler: Here, your "Dream Box."
Traveler: You got one, too?

## Talk 3

Ami: Is this... for me?
Ami: I wasn't serious about the box or the paper! So it's alright, you don't need to apologize!
Javi: Don't worry, this flower pot has no use for me anyway. Please take it.
Javi: I've asked someone to find some seeds. They should arrive at any minute...
Traveler: Seeds are coming!
Javi: Huh? When did you arrive? I didn't even notice...
Javi: Ahem... Ami, you wanted to be a florist, right? You can start with planting these.
Ami: Thanks... But if I do that beside my dad's shop, bugs might get into the pot...
Ami: That would be a pity, for the bugs in the pot, and the grown-ups having bugs in their food.
Ami: But if I move the flowers further, I might forget about them. That's also a pity, for the dying flowers...
Ami: Besides, dad is always busy, and he never lets me go far...
Javi: Um... We can take care of it together, if you want. How about that?
Javi: Although I could only visit after work, I do have some free time.
Ami: Great! But dad might say no...
Javi: Mr. Jahangir and I are basically friends. He should agree if we talk to him together.
Ami: Okay! I... I want more flowers, then! Sumeru Rose is my favorite! Someday... I'll surround my dad's shop with Sumeru Roses!
Javi: Good, that's a beautiful dream, little girl. Let's do our best for that!
Traveler: Please save one for me.
Ami: Thank you! Lemme think... I want a Sweet Flower, too, and what else...
Javi: So the kid is really into flowers. Hope she could stick to that dream...
Javi: Hehe... Hope she won't grow up like me, a common and boring guy.
Javi: Ahem! Thanks for your help, Traveler. Please take this as compensation for your trouble.
Traveler: Living with all your heart is more than common.
Javi: Thanks. I'm not complaining, though.
Javi: I was just... having some thoughts after seeing the "dream" I've buried.
Javi: Alright, I should leave now. Thanks for your help today, Traveler.
Javi: Maybe I should... write down another "dream" and bury it back there...
Traveler: Living with all your heart is never boring.
Traveler: You can do it!
Traveler: Here, the flower seeds.
