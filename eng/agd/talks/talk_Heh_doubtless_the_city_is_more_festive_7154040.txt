Musheng: Heh, doubtless, the city is more festive.
Musheng: The heroes we commemorate during Lantern Rite are actually adepti who lived in Liyue in the distant past.
Musheng: If you have heard the new opera that's out this year, you should know about the "Sanctification of Tao Dou."
Musheng: I was just thinking... Since Rex Lapis is both a god and The Prime of Adepti, isn't it possible that there'd be other gods amongst the adepti...?
Musheng: Of course, the "Eight Adepts" this time have more mortals amongst them than adepti, hah.
Musheng: Still, no matter who you are, good heroes from all walks of life, please watch over us here in Liyue, and grant us your blessings!
