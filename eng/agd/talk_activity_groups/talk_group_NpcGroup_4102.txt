Traveler: Only those on the list can get it?
Salar: Yes. I'm commissioned by the Akademiya researchers to allocate free fertilizers to farmers on the list.
Salar: The Anahitian Blessing is a union of the Dendro Archon's gift and the sages' wisdom. It is very effective and easy to apply.
Salar: As long as our farmers follow directions and use it regularly, they will be guaranteed a bountiful harvest.
