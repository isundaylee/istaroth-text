# Matsumoto's Fried Egg Fracas


## Talk 1

Traveler: Can I offer you a nice Teyvat Fried Egg...
Matsumoto: Aha, you must have seen my commission. You know, I've been to both Uyuu Restaurant and Kiminami Restaurant, and I was underwhelmed.
Matsumoto: I think that the really talented chefs must be hiding out of sight. That's why I posted a commission.
Matsumoto: If you're here, it must surely mean that you've got 5 Teyvat Fried Eggs for me?
Traveler: They're ready
Traveler: No, not yet.
Matsumoto: Oh. Then please bring them to me when they're ready.

## Talk 2

Matsumoto: Good, then I will sample your cooking. I hope it won't disappoint me.
