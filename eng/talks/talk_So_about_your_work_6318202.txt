Traveler: So, about your work...
Ooshima Junpei: Oh, it's you, Traveler! Thanks for introducing me to this job.
Ooshima Junpei: As we agreed, the future maintenance of this shrine will become my responsibility.
Ooshima Junpei: As for my payment... ah, the provisional head priestess says that she'll think of something. I just need to take care of the shrine.
Ooshima Junpei: Hmm. Maybe I should try making a few wood carvings in my free time later.
