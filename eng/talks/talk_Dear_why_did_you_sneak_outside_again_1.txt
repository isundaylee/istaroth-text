Raef: Dear, why did you sneak outside again?
Nermin: Oh, uh, don't worry! The night's not quite as hot, so it's perfect for getting some fresh air outside.
Raef: But isn't the difference in temperatures between night and day precisely the reason you need to take care of yourself? You've only just recovered... You should spend a bit more time resting...
Nermin: Yes, I know, I know. I just need to get out sometimes, you know? Just sometimes.
Nermin: And well, look at you! You're still a young man, but you already sound as old as my folks.
Raef: Wh—What? ...I mean, anyone who cares about you would say that! ...Ahem, anyway. How's the pot of flowers I gave you?
Nermin: Um, yes, thanks for sending me the flowers. They are very lovely. But the leaves are starting to turn yellow...
Nermin: Sorry, I haven't been taking good care of them...
Raef: N—No, don't apologize! It's fine, it's not your fault!
