Traveler: How's work?
Najia: Mr. Zubayr is very strict about every aspect of a performance, so I always worry that I'm not good enough...
Najia: Are the props attractive enough? Is every detail the best it can be? Do the mechanisms operate smoothly? I think hard about these things daily.
Najia: Sometimes, it's enough for me to get the urge to join Kshahrewar. Some Kshahrewar regulars are on good terms with me as well...
Najia: But then I'd give that up. It's not as if I was building a real palace or anything.
