Gaming: Okay, you're gonna laugh at me for this, but whatever. Every time I open a book, I doze off in under ten minutes, without fail...
Gaming: But Wushou dancing, on the other hand... I can happily practice away all night long, and still be bouncing off the walls in the morning as I get ready to head out for dim sum...
Gaming: Wait... what if... I were to read a book while performing a Wushou dance? Hohoho, sounds like a plan, right?
