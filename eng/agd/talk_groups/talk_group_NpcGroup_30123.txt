Hu Tao: #Well hello there, Traveler! A happy and healthy Lantern Rite to you!
Hu Tao: And what brings you here on this finest of days? Not business, I presume? So what is it? Need my help?
Traveler: Just came to see you.
Hu Tao: Oh, I see! So you just missed me all of a sudden? Oh, you — why'd you have to go and be so thoughtful, hmm? I couldn't possibly bring myself to scare you with a ghost story now!
Hu Tao: To tell the truth, this Lantern Rite's been a busy one for me. I got Xiangling to give me a few recipes and I've been trying my hand at them. Since you're here, why don't you have a taste...
Hu Tao: Wh—What's that look for!? ...You're not leaving already are you? C'mon, don't go — I promise they don't taste that bad! And I promise, it's not a prank!
Traveler: Just here to chat with you.
