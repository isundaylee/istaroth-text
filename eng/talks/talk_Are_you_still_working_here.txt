Traveler: Are you still working here?
Desnos: Honorary Senior Researcher! So happy to see you! Take a seat, I'll make some coffee... Oh. I drank all the coffee. I guess I'll have to pour you some water.
Desnos: Right. As you see, I'm continuing my qualifications review work here. But... well, as before, there are still very few adventurers coming to apply for work.
