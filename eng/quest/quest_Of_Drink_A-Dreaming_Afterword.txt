Luka: Wow... Business certainly has been picking up in the tavern recently.
Luka: Some customers came for the drinks, but most came for you.
Paimon: Hmm... Why is that still hard to believe...
Luka: I've never seen a more successful Bartender Academy Week. We earned both money and reputation this time.
Luka: Anyway, well done my friends.
Paimon: Huh, it's only been a few days and now we're buddies?
Traveler: In some sense...
Luka: I've been meaning to ask, would you consider staying and working here?
Paimon: #No can do. Though unlimited refills is enticing, Paimon made a promise to keep traveling with {F#her}{M#him}.
Luka: Okay then, I won't twist your arm. In fact, Charles had mentioned that to me, as well.
Luka: Well, feel free to come back and visit the Angel's Share whenever you like. And, remember to bring your friends!
Traveler: Sure thing.
Luka: Good luck on your journey, Traveler!
Traveler: He's not entirely wrong...
