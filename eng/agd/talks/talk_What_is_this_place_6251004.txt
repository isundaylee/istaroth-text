Traveler: What is this place?
Sergeant Lin: This is the headquarters of the Millelith unit in Chenyu Vale.
Sergeant Lin: It would be foolish to expose ourselves, so we chose an inconspicuous and unused residential building for our use.
Sergeant Lin: The decorations in the yard make it look like just another Secure Transport Agency. Most people who accidentally end up here, like you, have no idea what this building is for.
Sergeant Lin: As for military training... Most soldiers sent here are elites who already have the basics down.
Sergeant Lin: They only need to occasionally train outside the city to maintain their prowess.
