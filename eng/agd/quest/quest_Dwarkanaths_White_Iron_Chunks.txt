# Dwarkanath's White Iron Chunks


## Talk 1

Traveler: About White Iron Chunks...
Dwarkanath: Ah, I remember. Iradj's always losing my knives so I posted the commission.
Dwarkanath: I guess you've got those five White Iron Chunks?
Traveler: Here are the White Iron Chunks you wanted.
Traveler: Not yet.
Dwarkanath: Doesn't hurt to prepare more of that. You can't have enough knives for Iradj to lose. That idiot...

## Talk 2

Dwarkanath: Thank you, I will go to dad later to make a bunch of knives. Can't wait to see Iradj's face when he gets them, haha!
