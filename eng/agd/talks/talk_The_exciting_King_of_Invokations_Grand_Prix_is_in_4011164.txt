Tournament Notice (Message): Huh, I didn't think you building designers could play cards so well. Quite a few players from Kshahrewar made it to the quarterfinals.
Tournament Notice (Reply): What do you mean, "building designers"? We study structural geometry and mechanism theory, and it's MUCH more complex than staring at words all day in Haravatat.
Tournament Notice (Reply): "Staring at words all day"? You should try "staring at words" a bit, maybe then you'd learn to write! Linguistics and Rune Studies are both extremely profound fields of knowledge.
Tournament Notice (Reply): Everyone has their specialties. But since nobody is willing to yield, why don't we organize an Interdarshan Invokation Championship?
Tournament Notice (Reply): Good idea!
Tournament Notice (Reply): Great idea!
Tournament Notice (Reply): I'll see you at the tournament!
