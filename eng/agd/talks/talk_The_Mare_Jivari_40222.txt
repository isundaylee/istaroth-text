Traveler: The Mare Jivari?
Stanley: Sharp! That's the best out of all my legendary stories.
Stanley: On the other side of this continent, there's a barren domain where nothing grows.
Stanley: A sea of ashes, with nothing but silence that will make your ears ring...
Stanley: ...*goes on and on*
Stanley: ...And the monster created a vortex in the Mare Jivari, so I held tightly onto my friend's hand...
Stanley: ...*goes on and on*
Stanley: ...Sadly, I was the only one who returned home to Mondstadt with tears in my eyes...
Stanley: Are you guys falling asleep!?
Stanley: Wake up! You!
