# A Festive First Adventure


## Talk 1

Tiantian: Hmm... Why didn't anyone come...
Traveler: Is something the matter?
Tiantian: Traveler! Could... could you hear me out? So it's the Lantern Rite right now, and the Guild was looking to hitch a ride on the festive cheer to do some advertising — to see if we could snag some new recruits.
Tiantian: I hear that Brother Qian's come up with a game called... called a somethingy-screen. I don't wanna be left out!
Tiantian: So I thought up a new activity. I call it... "My First Adventure."
Tiantian: Simply put, I wanted to use some Xiao Lanterns to mark out a gliding track.
Tiantian: Then, anyone who wants to take part in this activity can just open up their wind glider and follow the Xiao Lanterns as they fly...
Tiantian: You'd get to feel the thrill of adventure and take in the beautiful sights of Liyue, with Xiao Lanterns at your side the whole way! Sounds good, right?
Tiantian: I'd originally designed two tracks, but when I went to notify the Millelith, they said that I needed to find a test flier who could evaluate them from a safety perspective first.
Tiantian: You must have a lot of adventuring experience, right? Would you mind doing the evaluation for me?
Traveler: Let's have at it.
Tiantian: Thanks so much for your help! Let's go to Mt. Tianheng, then. That's where the first track starts.

## Talk 2

Tiantian: This is where the track begins. See? The Xiao Lanterns are all in position.
Tiantian: Alright then — you can begin whenever you're ready. Collect the Xiao Lanterns en route to your objective.

## Talk 3

Tiantian: This is the finish line. You're pretty good at this, aren't you... So, how did you find it?
Traveler: A very festive experience!
Tiantian: Hehe, of course! I put them there myself, you know.
Tiantian: Well then, let's go to the next track, shall we?
Traveler: The Xiao Lanterns were very pretty...

## Talk 4

Tiantian: Alright! This is where the track begins. Once again, the Xiao Lanterns are all in place.
Tiantian: You can begin as soon as you're ready. Same deal as before, collect the lanterns as you head for the objective.

## Talk 5

Tiantian: So, now that you've tested both tracks out, what's your overall impression?
Traveler: They're not bad.
Tiantian: Great! Guess I can report back to the Millelith now.
Tiantian: I'm sure that a fun activity like this will attract lots of people to join the Guild.
Tiantian: Ah, yes. Here's your remuneration for helping me evaluate those tracks. Please, take it.

## Talk 6

Traveler: Let me get warmed up first...
Tiantian: Sure, just let me know once you're ready.

## Talk 7

Traveler: It's showtime.

## Talk 8

Traveler: I need a moment.
Tiantian: No problem, just let me know once you're done.

## Talk 9

Traveler: Let's do this.
