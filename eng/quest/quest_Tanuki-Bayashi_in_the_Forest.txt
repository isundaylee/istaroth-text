# Tanuki-Bayashi in the Forest


## Talk 1

Ioroi: What? Weren't you off to enjoy your Sacred Secular Steaming Victuals or whatever?
Ioroi: Go now. If you run into that sneaky kitsune, remember to send her my regards.

## Talk 2

Paimon: We're finally here! This must be the Chinju Forest.
Paimon: Miss Masked Maiden said that an old friend of hers is in here.
Paimon: Well, let's get moving!

## Talk 3

Paimon: This is it? It's just a bunch of bare stones...
Paimon: Hmm? He seems to be using some kind of magic to...
Paimon: Whoa! The stones disappeared!
Traveler: That's amazing.
Paimon: So this is bake-danuki magic? Seems kinda fun!
Paimon: Thank you, Kichiboushi! Let's play Hide-and-Seek next time.
"Kichiboushi": Mm!
Traveler: That's kinda spooky.

## Talk 4

Paimon: The Sky Kitsune Statue that was supposed to protect the ward... It's empty inside.
Paimon: Maybe it was hidden by Miss Mask's old friend. Let's go find out!
Traveler: "Miss Mask," Paimon?
Paimon: Paimon just came up with that nickname. How is it? Easier to remember, right?
Traveler: Not at all.
Paimon: Well, forget it then... Anyway, let's find some clues first!
Traveler: It makes no sense.

## Talk 5

Ioroi: What? I didn't realize that it was so important. You should've said so earlier...
Ioroi: Agh, I was sealed over this thing for...
Traveler: One hundred years?
Ioroi: Ugh! Stop speaking so lightly of my misfortunes!
Ioroi: Never mind. It's all water under the bridge now. I do also have some inkling about the barrier near the forest.
Ioroi: Back when I was fighting that sneaky kitsune, I once saw it on the eastern seashore. It looks like a Thunder Sakura with a torii gate, right?
Ioroi: Back when that guy was battling the demons or whatever, I was worried that some of them might come out to hurt us. So I used magic to put a seal on that place.
Ioroi: Let me see. The seal should be under the cliff face to the east... Kichiboushi, take them there and remove the seal.
Traveler: Thank you, Ioroi.
Ioroi: Alright, alright. Enough jibber-jabber. Go now.
Ioroi: If you run into that sneaky kitsune, remember to send her my regards. Just say... let me think...
Ioroi: "You've ticked me off real good this time, you jerk. Come back and fight me — our contest isn't over yet! And help me break this seal while you're at it, would you? It's not as if I couldn't do it myself or anything, but you still owe me a favor! Also, Gyoubu Koban says he misses you!"
Paimon: Whoa, whoa, that's a lot to remember!
Traveler: One thousand years?
Traveler: One million years?

## Talk 6

Ioroi: Eek! I—I... Mine name is Ioroi. Do whatever you want! K—Kill me if that be your will!
Paimon: Wow, the statue is talking! And it's so scared that it can barely string a sentence together!
Ioroi: I am no statue! This unseemly appearance is but the work of a temporary seal! Mine name is Ioroi, the world-renowned bake-danuki!
Traveler: Ioroi?
Ioroi: What? Are you telling me that folk nowadays have heard naught of Ioroi?
Ioroi: The "Tanuki Gyouen Scroll," "Ioroi's Teapot," "Kakushigami Oobayashi," "Yougou Tanuki Gassen"... Of these tales have you heard nothing?
Ioroi: Ah, how long has mine seal persisted...
Traveler: I mean you no harm...
Ioroi: What? You aren't here to destroy me? Come now, why did you not say so earlier, then?
Ioroi: *cough* Ahem. Well then, speak! Why have you come seeking me, the lord of bake-danuki?
Traveler: This is about the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual...
Ioroi: The Sacred Secular what now? What is that? Some manner of oni treasure?
Traveler: This guy is unbelievable...
Paimon: *sigh* Is he really Miss Masked Maiden's old friend?
Paimon: Anyway, we're looking for something hidden inside a kitsune statue.
Ioroi: Eek... Uh, Wh—Why are you l—looking for that, might I ask?
Traveler: Ah.
Ioroi: Ugh, it's on that comb's account that I was sealed in here for...
Ioroi: ...
Traveler: One hundred years?
Ioroi: I don't know how long it's been! Sunlight doesn't come through the Chinju Forest. There's no way to tell time!
Ioroi: Back then, I wreaked havoc everywhere to lure that sneaky kitsune out, but it was all in vain.
Ioroi: Eventually, I decided to vent my anger by dismantling one of those kitsune statues, and I found a comb inside... Which gave me an idea!
Ioroi: The comb was hidden inside a kitsune statue and even had the Hakushin symbol on it, which reminded me of her white fur...
Ioroi: Thus, I concluded immediately that it must be very important. In which case, I just needed to hide the comb, and that sneaky kitsune would surely come out!
Paimon: Yup, treasure's a good way to lure people out for sure! Then what happened?
Ioroi: Then came one of the humans from the Yougou Three. He defeated my tribe and I, turning all of us to stone.
Paimon: So that's why Ioroi is afraid of humans...
Ioroi: Hmph! Humans. They're so short-lived, and they can't even transform... I don't get why that kitsune likes them so much.
Ioroi: That guy who sealed me up was especially infuriating. He even told me to "strike a nice pose so that I can become nice scenery." Why, that little—!
Traveler: Well, you do make for nice scenery...
Ioroi: Eh? You... How could you...
Paimon: #(Hey, Traveler, don't annoy him, or we may never get that ward...)
Traveler: I mean to say that you look really bold and burly...
Paimon: That's right! You make this dark forest look so much more colorful!
Ioroi: ...
Ioroi: And?
Traveler: Like the statue of a god...
Paimon: Well, so, being sealed up is not such a bad thing after all, eh? See, humans don't mean you any harm!
Ioroi: I reckon I can see where you're going, but at the same time... I also... don't?
Traveler: Could we borrow that comb you spoke of?
Ioroi: Well, you certainly could... But only if you play with the children first.
Paimon: #Sure, that's easy. Traveler is good with kids!
Traveler: Am I really...
Ioroi: Shousei, Gyoubu Koban, and Kichiboushi. Go find these *three little tanuki* and play with them. I would do it, but as you can see, I'm not exactly at any liberty to move.
Ioroi: That dratted fellow was a bit sloppy when he sealed them. That's why some of them were able to get out earlier.
Ioroi: ...Wait, that's not correct! We should say, rather, that we bake-danuki are most powerful indeed. It's only normal, therefore, that we could free ourselves from a mere human seal!
Traveler: Well, what about you then...
Paimon: Ahem! You speak truth, Ioroi the mighty and powerful!
Ioroi: Although their power can't really compare to mine, they can still use it to hide themselves.
Ioroi: Alright then, off you go.
Traveler: Indeed, most powerful!
Traveler: That's right, I play with Paimon all the time.
Paimon: Hey!
Traveler: Even the Statues of The Seven pale in comparison...
Traveler: I mean that you are truly handsome and truly...
Traveler: One thousand years?
Traveler: One million years?
Traveler: Now we're getting somewhere.
Traveler: I'm looking for wards here...
Ioroi: Warts? Are those edible? We bake-danuki do know quite a bit about cooking.
Paimon: No, it's the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual!
Ioroi: Victuals? Oh, it's been too long since I've had any victuals...
Traveler: I am here to collect a debt.
Ioroi: Uh, collect a debt? Where? When was that? Let me think, let me think...
Ioroi: You, uh... What do I owe you, again?
Paimon: He's thinking really hard...
Paimon: You probably shouldn't tell this sort of joke in front of strangers.
Ioroi: That's right, jest not so!
Ioroi: Mm, it's all good, it's all good... Actually, best I make sure. Do I really owe you nothing?
Paimon: ...Do you really owe that many debts?
Traveler: World-renowned?

## Talk 7

Ioroi: Ooh... I do so wish to scratch mine belly...
Ioroi: Mm? You're back already? Go on, help me find Shousei, Gyoubu Koban, and Kichiboushi, and go *play with them.*
Ioroi: Alright then, off you go.

## Talk 8

Ioroi: Hehe, well done! They seem to be quite happy.
Ioroi: ...Huh? Oh, no problem. Let me ask them for you.
Ioroi: Gyoubu Koban was asking, "If you are humans, why do you smell like tanuki?"
Ioroi: ...Actually, that's right! I demand an explanation! Why *do* you smell like tanuki?
Paimon: Eh? You're only asking this now...
Traveler: It was the masked shrine maiden...
Paimon: Right! That's what happened!
Paimon: Miss Masked Maiden cooked us a very lavish meal earlier, and she said that she used magic she secretly learned from the bake-danuki to make it.
Ioroi: What? She learned our magic in secret? How dare she...
Ioroi: Hmm... Could it be...
Ioroi: Oh, come on. That sneaky kitsune! If she was still alive, she could at least have come over to say hello, right?
Paimon: She's a shrine maiden with a mask, and she called you an "old friend."
Ioroi: Mask? I don't know anyone with a mask. Don't know any shrine maidens, either. I sure do know a kitsune, though.
Ioroi: ...That said, that sneaky kitsune did appear in the form of a shrine maiden before. What does the shrine maiden you speak of look like?
Paimon: She wears a white fox mask...
Ioroi: Anything else?
Traveler: She had short black hair.
Paimon: And she wore a shrine maiden outfit.
Ioroi: Hmm... Don't know her. Never seen anyone like that in mine life!
Paimon: Is that so...
Ioroi: ...Mm? Yeah, sure, leave it to me.
Ioroi: Shousei said, "It was fun playing with you. Thanks!"
Paimon: Paimon had a lot of fun too!
Traveler: So, about that comb...
Ioroi: Now, now — I am the world renowned bake-danuki Ioroi, and I will surely keep my word. You may have the comb.
Ioroi: But what do you plan to do with the comb, anyway? It probably still smells like kitsune.
Paimon: Well, here's what happened...
Traveler: She was dressed as a shrine maiden.
Paimon: And she had short black hair!
Traveler: We ate some strange stuff...

## Talk 9

Ioroi: Once upon a time, I was the renowned bake-danuki, Ioroi. One of these days, I will definitely use eight huge...
Ioroi: Oh, it's you... Ahem... Our fates are twined now, so ask me whatever questions you may have.
Traveler: About the Chinju Forest...
Ioroi: I may just be a stone statue now, but I was once a big shot known as Ioroi, the Hidden Protector of the Grove.
Ioroi: My job was to guard the Chinju Forest and everything in it. And as you can see, I've done a fine job indeed!
Traveler: Wait, weren't you being attacked by those hilichurls back there?
Ioroi: Eh? Oh, you misunderstand. The hilichurls mean no harm to me. It's just that I haven't been able to look for people to play with ever since being turned into stone. They're the only ones who have kept me company.
Ioroi: At first, I thought you were here with ill intentions because you're human. That's why I had them go after you. But it's good that you're okay.
Ioroi: Though we can't communicate and they may be a little dull-witted, I'd still count them among my companions after all this time.
Ioroi: It is strange, though. There didn't use to be this many hilichurls in Inazuma. I can't remember when that started...
Traveler: Protector of the Grove?
Ioroi: I used to be a bake-danuki, free as can be! I wasn't famous or anything, but I was free indeed, and I had that sneaky kitsune around to compete with often.
Ioroi: One day, the kitsune made a bet with me, claiming that I wouldn't be able to steal the Naku Weed from the Shogun's imperial garden. I accepted the challenge and almost got split in twain for it, just like Yashiori Island.
Ioroi: And in the end...
Ioroi: In the end, that sneaky kitsune pleaded with the Shogun on my behalf, and I was spared. Not only did the Shogun let me live, but she also bestowed upon me the sacred duty of the Protector of the Grove.
Ioroi: I will never forget what happened. I owe my life to that sneaky kitsune...
Traveler: Tell me a bit more about yourself.
Ioroi: Our kind have always lived on the lands of Narukami. Is there something confusing about that?
Traveler: How did you end up being sealed?
Ioroi: Err, how would I know...
Ioroi: Wait, it's probably because I stole that comb.
Ioroi: Like anyone would've known that the comb was meant to be used to make Sacred Sakura Daifukus!
Ioroi: So, the sneaky kitsune had stopped appeared since challenging me to hide-and-seek that day.
Ioroi: I tried everything to lure her out. I would cause all sorts of ruckus, knowing that she would always come and stop me.
Ioroi: I turned the Lavender Melon in Konda Village into potatoes, and Sunsettias into tigers. The sneaky kitsune would normally turn up to stop me at that point, but this time was different.
Ioroi: So I felt really angry afterwards and decided to go and destroy the statues of her kin. This was when I discovered the comb.
Ioroi: I thought to myself, "that sneaky kitsune would surely be flustered and appear if I stole this comb." So I did.
Ioroi: In the end, a young human appeared instead of that sneaky kitsune. If mine mind serves me well, he was one of the three who learned their arts from the Yougou Tengu.
Ioroi: I had no idea why he was so strong, but he was able to seal me and the others into the stone statues.
Traveler: About your bout with the kitsune...
Ioroi: Terrible, isn't it? That kitsune dared to challenged me to hide-and-seek.
Ioroi: She even said "Don't show yourself for anything," "If anything happens, it's me using spells to provoke you." Weird, right?
Ioroi: I'm a bake-danuki, as well as the Protector of the Grove. Naturally, I couldn't turn down a challenge of hide-and-seek in the Chinju Forest.
Ioroi: I found a great spot and turned myself into an Onikabuto, so I could watch as she ran all over the place looking for me!
Ioroi: However, she never came, and so the challenge goes on.
Ioroi: I will keep waiting for that sneaky kitsune to come back and apologize to me. Hmph, actually, there's a lot she needs to apologize for! I'll have her know that I'm keeping score!
Traveler: About the little bake-danuki...
Ioroi: The Chinju Forest used to be the territory of yours truly, Ioroi, the Hidden Protector of the Grove, and my kind, up until that human turned us into stone.
Ioroi: So if you see stone statues that look like me, there's probably a bake-danuki sealed inside.
Ioroi: However, the seals seem to have loosened recently. Kichiboushi and the others have returned to their original form, so there's still hope for me yet.
Ioroi: Hey, can you promise me something?
Ioroi: Be nice to my little bake-danuki when you see them out there.
Ioroi: They've been sealed for so long... All they want to do is see the outside world.
Traveler: Goodbye, Ioroi.
Ioroi: Ah, that person would probably recite some complicated poem right now... See you around.
Ioroi: Come and play with me when you are free. I mean... I'm a stone after all, so I've got nothing but time to play.
