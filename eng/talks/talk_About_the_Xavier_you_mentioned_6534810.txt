Traveler: About the Xavier you mentioned...
Goldoni: Xavierius, citizen, or Lucius Septimius Sebelius. Not "Xavier." Your pronunciation is most strange.
Goldoni: He was a respectable man, but he put his faith in the wrong thing. Inconceivably, he believed...
Goldoni: No, he twisted Dominus Cassiodor's words, to the point that he did not notice the barbarians' schemes in time.
Goldoni: Just as you have heard, his negligence caused the fall of Petrocorii. Countless citizens were massacred by the barbarians, and the streets were awash with ruin and blood in a single night.
Goldoni: Weakness only brings calamity, and kindness, disaster. Our ignorant slaves may be swayed by well-meaning lies, but our vision should extend further.
