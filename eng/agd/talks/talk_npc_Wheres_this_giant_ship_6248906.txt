Traveler: Where's this giant ship?
Yizheng: It's really easy to get stranded in the rivers here, so it's no place for large ships. You'll see them in Yilong Wharf and Liyue Harbor, though.
Yizheng: The giant ships with metal frames fear no storms and can sail right into huge waves. Exciting, don't you think?
Yizheng: I would have been on one of those and traveling the world right now if it weren't for my seasickness.
