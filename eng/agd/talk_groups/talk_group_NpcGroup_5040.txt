Traveler: Picking a gift?
Xugney: That's right! It's been a while since I've returned to Fontaine, so I'm trying to see what's new.
Xugney: Upon sailing to other nations, I found that their peoples quite admire our advanced machine industry — I must confess that I've grown quite proud of it myself.
Xugney: But the way I see it, these clockwork devices don't quite live up to the image they have in mind...

Traveler: Sorry for bothering you.

Traveler: Floating aquabuses...
Xugney: Oh, that's a capital idea. But if we had those, would we really need waterways?

Xugney: I wonder how his daughter, Navia, is doing. I should go say hello if I get the chance...
