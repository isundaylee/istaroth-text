# There Will Come Soft Rains


## Talk 1

Paimon: Um, there really is nothing here... You sure this is the place?
Mamere: It... It should be. Father couldn't be wrong...
Paimon: Still, Paimon didn't expect that Seymour could dive...
Seymour: Affirmative. I am equipped with the latest multi-use diving unit, with which I may always accompany my master and those composed of pure water, the...
Glaisti: Huh? Mamere? What are you doing here?
Paimon: Whoa! Where did you come from...
Glaisti: Sorry! Did I scare you? Those monsters kinda just came jumping out of those glowing circles, so I hid in the cleft of the rocks...
Paimon: It's all good as long as you're okay! Are you alone?
Glaisti: No, there's a friend of mine who's been trapped over there...
Glaisti: That child's name is Puca... Tall one, could I please ask you to rescue her?
Traveler: Leave it to us.
Paimon: Yes. Let's go!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Ooh, so there was a village here too, huh?
Puca: Yes. This place was closer to the ore veins, so...
Glaisti: As for me, I'm here because it makes it easier to care for the injured animals in the area.
Glaisti: #Anyway, we should be safe once we reach home. Thank you, {NICKNAME}, Paimon!
Glaisti: Thank you as well, Mamere! If it wasn't for you, we might've never made it back! Let's have tea next time we get the chance.
Mamere: ...Um...
Paimon: Oh come on, now's not the time to be shy!
Mamere: I—I'm not shy! I'm just...
Glaisti: Oh, never mind, I understand.
Glaisti: #In that case, we'll go back first. Thank you for escorting us, {NICKNAME}, Paimon.
Paimon: See you! Stay safe!
Paimon: Well, guess our rescue mission's done and dusted, eh?
Mamere: Thank you for your help, and for being willing to trust me.
Mamere: Otherwise, I wouldn't have known what to do when faced with those monsters...
Seymour: #{M#Negative. According to hypotheticals generated from previous data, milady, my sweeper mode would have been capable of negating the threat posed by those hostile lifeforms.}{F#Affirmative. If not for this lady here, I would not have been able to eliminate those lifeforms so quickly.}
Seymour: #{M#If not for this gentleman's help, however, I would not have eliminated them as quickly. Thank you for your aid.}{F#However, hypotheticals generated from previous data indicate that my sweeper mode would have neutralized the threat posed by those hostile lifeforms, albeit requiring a longer period of time.}
Paimon: #Hehe, {NICKNAME} and Paimon are well-seasoned adventurers, y'know! Still, what are these things doing inside Elynas?
Traveler: And they appeared alongside the quake, too.
Mamere: I wonder how Father is doing...
Paimon: Speaking of that, Paimon thought that Father was a secret only the Melusines knew about. Paimon didn't think that the other Melusines hadn't heard of him either...
Mamere: That's right. No one can hear his voice, just like how no one can understand the paintings' contents.
Mamere: They would think that I was talking to myself whenever I spoke to Father.
Paimon: That's understandable...
Traveler: (That means that the voice I heard then was...)
Paimon: Well, now that we've seen you repair Seymour and take us to help Puca and such, Paimon's sure that your Father must be a decent person!
Mamere: Absolutely! He's the best in the world...
Paimon: Whoa! Everything's shaking again!
Mamere: ...!
Mamere: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon! Those monsters... They've appeared elsewhere...
Paimon: Huh!?
Mamere: This time, they've showed up where we were collecting paints previously...
Paimon: You mean the place with the large house and the shipwreck?
Paimon: It's a long way there from here...
Mamere: Y—Yes, I know... Ohh, what should we do? If we don't make it in time...
Seymour: There is no need to take the long way. We can ascend directly from here.
Mamere: Eh? But there should be no path up there.
Seymour: I have just completed a full scan of the surrounding areas.
Seymour: We need only penetrate the layers of rock above us to reach Merusea Village directly. That will allow us to reach our destination in good time.
Paimon: It's not that simple, y'know! What do you mean "need only penetrate the layers of rock above us"... How do we do that?
Seymour: I detect a lack of faith in my functionalities, Ms. Paimon. Concern is unnecessary. My most advanced mining module can penetrate rock layers of this thickness.
Seymour: #{M#Noble Sir}{F#Noble and lovely Lady} {NICKNAME}, {M#please}{F#I ask you to} take me to the waters up above. I cannot maintain diving unit operation while my mining module is active.
Paimon: Well, guess he can do that too, huh?
Traveler: They're my least favorite monsters.
Paimon: No wonder you were going at them that hard...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Mamere! We've collected a whole bunch of components. Will these do?
Mamere: You've collected so many in such a short time... Amazing...
Mamere: Guess that's what I should've expected from outlanders who've experienced lots of things and met lots of people!
Paimon: Hehe, we've done this sorta thing loads of times, after all!
Paimon: That said, how are we gonna use these components to fix Seymour?
Mamere: Don't worry, just leave it to me. Things will be alright... just like Father said!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): She opens the immobile robot dog up along the slit in its back in a manner ill-befitting of repairs.\nThen, she stuffs the scattered components on the ground into the dog seemingly without looking, as one might when well-practiced at one's job...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): With that done, she takes out a strange mechanical component from her pocket — it resembles an intricately-packaged candy with some indecipherable runes carved into it. She embeds this into the gear on the dog's head, and with a "clack," they come together...\nComponents of unknown purpose skitter across the ground. She picks them all up — they are as valuable as Mora in this place, after all.
Paimon: Will... this really work? It might just be Paimon's imagination, but it feels like more components dropped than we collected in the first place...
Paimon: On that note... The thing you pulled out a moment ago seems kinda different from those components...
Mamere: This? Well, it's not a component. It's a token.
Paimon: A token?
Mamere: That's right. It was something we were all born with. Father said that if we put this in as well, we'd be able to cure Seymour...
Paimon: Wait. You were born with it? Does that mean...
Paimon: Actually, Paimon's not sure how Melusines are born in the first place!
Mamere: I'm... not sure either, now that I'm considering it. But in my first memories, I had the token with me... That's how it is for everyone.
Paimon: Eh? Then isn't it something really valuable to you?
Mamere: Yes... "Tokens" are very important to us — they're different from ordinary components.
Mamere: They were the first memento we received when we arrived in this beautiful world — they are proof that we are alive.
Paimon: But if that's the case, why did you just use it like that...
Mamere: Well, I didn't throw it away or anything... Seymour will be by my side, right? And he's this way because he tried to save me, so...
Seymour: —
Seymour: Relay module detected. Environment check... Contamination levels: High. Activating in Safe Mode.
Paimon: Whoa! It suddenly moved!
Seymour: Unidentified life forms detected... Related information entered. It is a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Mamere, and...
Mamere: #...They're {NICKNAME} and Paimon.
Seymour: #You have entered this data previously. It is an honor to meet you, {M#noble Mr.}{F#Ms.} {NICKNAME}, and Paimon, the adorable little one.
Seymour: #{M#Thank you for your help in the previous altercation. I am Prototype 4ACV07. You may call me Seymour.}{F#It was my honor to witness your elegant swordsmanship during the previous altercation, Miss. I am Prototype 4ACV07. You may call me Seymour.}
Seymour: Up till today, for (1/7)×10^21 clockwork cycles, my functions were in hibernation, awaiting their awakening by my master, such that I may continue fulfilling my assignment.
Paimon: Huh? Hibernation? Couldn't you talk normally before, though?
Seymour: By "normal speech," you refer to my pre-configured automated responses, yes?
Mamere: ...Huh?
Seymour: Your observation is most sharp, almost comparable to that of my master. Previously, when you would bring my artificed clockwork relay module nearby, Ms. Mamere, my main voice unit would be automatically triggered.
Paimon: An artificed clockwork relay module?
Traveler: Are you referring to her token?
Seymour: I apologize, but I cannot answer your question. I do not understand the meaning of this "token" you refer to.
Seymour: As such, I can make no judgment as to any relationship between this "token" and said artificed relay module.
Seymour: Regardless, while hibernating, I would automatically play preset responses to specific situations to ensure that my voice-over units would work properly once energy supply was restored.
Paimon: Huh? In other words, you were just playing fixed lines before — is that what you mean?
Seymour: Affirmative. Your understanding is completely correct, Paimon, as befits your elegance and wisdom.
Seymour: A large amount of energy is required to operate my natural language processing unit. My logic unit actively shuts it off when power supply cannot be guaranteed so as to prevent complete loss of my functionality.
Mamere: So that means...
Mamere: So... All the things you said to me before were just... pre-written?
Seymour: Affirmative. Your understanding is correct, Ms. Mamere. During my previous hibernation, our interactions were all performed through the playback of pre-recorded voice assets.
Mamere: *sigh* I...
Paimon: (Uh-oh...)
Seymour: However, my visual and information processing modules were not shut off, so I do have the paintings you displayed in my memory unit.
Seymour: I can recognize more than one hundred and three thousand, nine hundred different styles of art, but your work does not match any of them.
Seymour: As such, I can reasonably infer that your art has unprecedented artistic value. I did not mention this before using my preset voice assets, so consider this appended to any previous related comments.
Mamere: R—Really...?
Seymour: Affirmative.
Paimon: You see? The only reason people don't understand your art is because your style is too new and unique — so don't worry about it. They'll get it in the future for sure!
Mamere: Th—Thank you, Seymour, Paimon... I was afraid that...
Paimon: See, even Seymour says so. You've gotta believe in yourself, and believe in us too! We understand your paintings, and they are truly beautiful.
Seymour: In any case, thank you all for your help in restoring my lost relay module. This way, I will be able to better fulfill my mission — protect my master.
Paimon: By master, you mean Mamere? Is that why you suddenly activated to protect her when she was in danger?
Seymour: Negative. I am infinitely grateful to her for taking care of me during my hibernation. However, she is not my master. My master is...
Paimon: Is...?
Seymour: I apologize. Some of my memories have suffered light damage. Inference, caused by previous damage. Unable to locate data related to "master."
Seymour: Reason for previous emergency activation is unknown. That should not have happened. I must schedule logic unit maintenance.
Mamere: Well... Why don't we have something to eat, Seymour? You've never eaten anything before. Maybe you'll figure something out once you've had your fill...
Paimon: Not every problem can be solved by eating, you know! Just... most of them...
Seymour: Estimated data damage: High. Attempting global search for relevant information. Searching last recorded segment.
Seymour: Failure. Critical data damaged. Search procedure has been forcefully terminated.
Paimon: Um, are you really okay? It feels like you're getting worse somehow...
Seymour: Thank you for your concern, Ms. Paimon, but do not worry. I was merely running a self-diagnostic. I can confirm that everything is operating normall—
Paimon: Agh! What's going on?
Traveler: (It was accompanied by a quake this time...)
Seymour: Warning. Extreme increase in environmental contamination detected.
Seymour: For your safety, please leave this place to avoid irreversible damage.
Paimon: Wait... what kind of contamination are you talking about? What's going on?
Mamere: Ah...
Mamere: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon... Father says... it's dangerous, hurry...
Paimon: F—Father again? Wait... what danger? What do we have to hurry and do?
Mamere: The scattered Melusines. Danger... There's no time to explain. Please, help me!
Paimon: #Whatever the case, {NICKNAME}, Paimon has a real bad feeling about the quake just now. Maybe it has something to do with what Mamere was talking about. Let's get going!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Wait, what's wrong? Why can't we continue on?
Mamere: Strange... it seems like something's blocking the way...
Paimon: Ohh, what do we do...
Traveler: We could use Seymour to break the wall down...
Seymour: #I apologize, {M#Mr.}{F#Ms.}{NICKNAME}, but that is impossible. The thickness of the rock wall exceeds my output limits. I would run out of energy before a tunnel could be successfully bored.
Mamere: S—Swim... from over there... Father's... blood... is already...
Paimon: Blood? Mamere, are you okay? What blood?
Mamere: #We cannot... delay any further. Please, {NICKNAME}... Seymour... Let's swim from over there...
Traveler: The currents over there...
Mamere: That's right. Swim... Over there... Because Father's blood... is already...
Paimon: Blood? Mamere, are you okay? What blood?
Mamere: We cannot... delay any further. Let's swim from over there...

## Talk 5

Glaisti: Thank you, tall person. Thank you, good-hearted Specter!
Paimon: #Hang on a sec, who're you calling a Specter? Paimon's Paimon, and this is {NICKNAME}... Anyway, what was all that just now? Why are you two in a place like this?
Puca: I don't know what happened earlier either. The ground suddenly started to shake, and those scary, scary monsters started to show up... *sob*
Glaisti: Puca and I were here to pick up those beautiful stones. We've been here many times, and this never happened, nor have we ever seen those frightening creatures...
Glaisti: So... I've been wanting to ask this, but why is Mamere here?
Mamere: ...
Traveler: Mamere brought us here.
Glaisti: Huh? But how did you know we were here?
Mamere: #...Father told me. He told me that you were in danger, and that I should ask {NICKNAME} and Paimon to come and save you...
Puca: Father...?
Glaisti: Ah, I see, so it was Father who asked you to come and save us... Thank you, Mamere!
Paimon: (Eh? So you know who Father is, Glaisti?)
Glaisti: (Um, no?)
Paimon: (?)
Glaisti: (Still, Mamere always talks to herself about how she is able to speak to "Father." I've always supposed that that's her imaginary friend — she's largely alone otherwise...)
Puca: I don't know what's going on, but thank you all the same...
Mamere: Don't thank me, I didn't do anything... Father's the one who told me what to do...
Seymour: My apologies for interrupting, Ms. Mamere, Ms. Puca. Considering our surroundings, I suggest that we leave this place post-haste to avoid further attacks.
Puca: Agh! Another dog appeared...!
Glaisti: Calm down, Puca! This is the robotic dog Mamere picked up before, right?
Glaisti: Hmm... It couldn't move before, though, could it?
Seymour: A keen observation, Ms. Glaisti.
Seymour: Regardless, my logic circuits recommend that we not tarry. Please allow me to escort you to a safe location. The contamination index here has exceeded the threshold of human tolerance.
Paimon: Contamination index?
Traveler: (Could that be related to the hallucinations I saw earlier...?)
Puca: A... safe place? So do we just need to go back home?
Paimon: Yup! Paimon doesn't know what Seymour means by this "contamination index" stuff, but we might get attacked again if we stay here, so let's get you all home safe first!
Glaisti: Got it. Thank you, Ms. Paimon! You've got a good heart!
Paimon: Hehe, alright, let's go!

## Talk 6

Black Screen Text: The prismatic resonance shatters the ore, and a Melusine unexpectedly falls out...\nYou rush over to help her up, and fortunately, she doesn't appear to be injured...
Virda: Huh? Mamere? What are you doing here? And you are...
Paimon: #Paimon's Paimon, and {M#he}{F#she}'s {NICKNAME}. Mamere brought us here.
Virda: Ah, is that so? Thank you all! My name is Virda, but just call me Vi. I'm an apprentice agent of the Marechaussee Phantom!
Virda: Still, um, I didn't think I would get into this mess. How embarrassing...
Paimon: An apprentice agent? Ooh, so you're with the authorities in Fontaine!
Virda: Uh, no, no, it's a self-proclaimed title at the moment. One day, though, I'll be a proper agent, just like Sedile!
Paimon: Wait, so you can give yourself that title?
Paimon: Anyway, what happened just now? Why did you end up hiding inside a rock?
Virda: Eh? Did I do something like that? I don't remember.
Virda: I just remember falling down while fleeing, but nothing else after that...
Mamere: That... was Father protecting you.
Virda: Father?
Paimon: #Ah, never mind that for now — even {NICKNAME} and Paimon don't know what that's about...
Paimon: More importantly, are there any other Melusines trapped here?
Virda: Hmm, I didn't see anyone else. I was doing special training alone here, after all...
Virda: But I did catch sight of some humans I've never seen before... Might've been four of them?
Mamere: Humans you've never seen before? What?
Paimon: Wait just a sec. Did you come across some purple guy and three people in red scarves?
Virda: That's right! Are they your friends?
Paimon: Uh, how should we explain this...
Black Screen Text: You tell Virda about what happened before...
Virda: Huh!? So that actually happened?
Virda: Now that I think about it, they *were* behaving very suspiciously! *sigh* I guess I still have a lot to learn. Were Sedile in my shoes...
Traveler: Did you see which way they went?
Virda: Yes! They were heading that way!
Paimon: #Alright then. Let's go after them, {NICKNAME}!
Kaykaus: S—Sis! Why are these things still chasing us!?
Irus: Do I look like I know, you numbskull? It's just bad luck— Agh, c'mon, are they seriously still coming!?
Virda: Ah! It's those suspicious people! Stop! Don't run!
Paimon: Be careful! Those things behind them are...
Irus: Ugh, you're—! P—Please help! We'll pay you, I swear!
Paimon: #Uh oh, all those monsters are coming this way! Careful, {NICKNAME}!
Seymour: Excess hostile reactions detected. Switching to purification mode. For your own safety, Ms. Mamere, please keep a certain distance.

## Talk 7

Irus: Saved at last... Whoa, hey, hey, what are you doing?
Virda: Arresting the masterminds behind the summoning of these creatures — what else?
Kaykaus: W—Wait, we didn't do anything! We were just being chased by those monsters, honest!
Paimon: What's going on? Tell us everything! Also, what about that purple guy... Where's Jakob?
Virda: That's right, confess!
Irus: *sigh* Whatever. Now that it's come to this, we might as well come clean. Just our luck, seriously... We should never have taken this job...
Irus: That madman got us to bring him those red stones... Y'know, those you gathered previously. He said they'd be important.
Paimon: Important for what?
Irus: For whatever the heck he was going to do with them! He didn't tell us anything else. Just "get me the ores" — by Al-Ahmar, we're mercs, not miners!
Irus: And we did it for him, alright — for half a day we worked! And at the end of it, he didn't even pay us when we gave him his damned ores. He even started saying some... weird stuff!
Irus: We hadn't even caught what he said before he took the fragments and left, dropping us like a sack of potatoes with a "useless," and a "I guess old ways are the best" — and no pay either!
Irus: I was going to get even with that scoundrel, but he did some hand-sign and blabbered out... something in a language I didn't know. That's when those monsters appeared, and they chased us all the way here. Why, that scumbag...
Traveler: Did he summon the monsters at the other locations?
Irus: What? What other locations are you talking about?
Mamere: The same monsters appeared in areas around the village, and they're attacking Melusines wherever they find them!
Irus: Wait... Did something like that happen? I didn't know, I swear! After leaving your place, that Jakob guy led us to the intersection up ahead. We didn't really delay...
Paimon: So basically, he never told you anything except that you should go steal the paintings?
Irus: Ugh, don't even bring it up... Never mind "telling" us anything — that charlatan didn't even "pay" us our deposit!
Paimon: Why'd you work so hard for someone who doesn't even pay a deposit!?
Mamere: Is it because... you thought he was handsome?
Kaykaus: Oh, so you like purple, do you, Boss?
Irus: What in the world are you talking about, you idiot? Of course not! How's that guy handsome, anyway — also, what kind of reason is "I like purple"!?
Irus: Hmph! Well, he sure looked like he was in the Mora! I hoped that a little extra enthusiasm might get him to part with more of it, so I decided to waive his deposit...
Paimon: And that's what you call a self-inflicted wound...
Paimon: Ugh. Looks like we won't be able to get anything useful from these guys. How should we deal with them now...
Virda: Hehe, don't worry, leave it to me. I'm not an official agent yet, but I can escort them back to the village and hand them over to Sedile, no problem!
Irus: W—W—Wait just a moment! Aren't we victims too?
Mamere: You...! You ransacked my house, hurt Seymour... and still, you claim to be victims...
Virda: Hmph, that's right, that's— wait, whose house did they ransack?
Paimon: Stop! That's not the main point!
Virda: Exactly! To think that you'd even do something like that! Hmph, you're incorrigible! Come with me, now, and don't you dare resist!
Irus: W—Wait! You're going after that guy, aren't you? We know where he's gone!
Irus: Listen, he's headed towards the place where the giant rock is hanging. Y'know, over that way... If you give chase now, you could still catch him!
Paimon: The place with a giant stone? Wait, you mean...
Mamere: It's a warm place that makes people at ease...
Traveler: Why would you tell us this?
Irus: Hey, even mercenaries know how to be picky about our employers! That self-serving, monster-summoning fraudster is no employer of mine, no matter how much he's offering!
Irus: Not that he even paid us the deposit in the first place, I mean!
Paimon: Aaaaah! Everything's shaking again!
Kaykubad: Hey, Sis, do you think this earthquake could be...
Irus: Crap. If more of those monsters show up... H—Hey, shorty, you wanted to arrest us, right? Quick, do it now! We surrender — unconditionally!
Virda: Huh, that's more like it! Go reform yourselves at the Fortress of Meropide and learn to be useful to society!
Paimon: Well... Guess we'll leave them to you. We'll get to the bottom of these quakes.
Virda: Hmph. Alright, mercs, don't get any funny ideas, or the Maison Gardiennage are gonna show you what for!
Black Screen Text: After disarming the mercenaries and tying their hands, Virda escorts them away.
Paimon: #So, uh, what are we supposed to do now, {NICKNAME}?
Mamere: ...Ugh!
Paimon: Mamere? What's wrong? You don't look good at all...
Mamere: No, it's not that... it's... Father...
Mamere: It hurts... No... Why are you doing that...
Traveler: ...I heard it too.
Paimon: #And you look just as horrible, {NICKNAME}! You heard something? What did you hear?
Traveler: I'm fine, but...
Traveler: We must hurry.
Mamere: That's right... There's no time...
Paimon: Even if you say that... Shouldn't you rest for a bit? You look like you're hurting all over...
Mamere: Yes... It hurts... I've never... experienced anything like this before.
Mamere: But I must go... Father must be suffering far more than I am...
Mamere: #Please... {NICKNAME} and Paimon. Please... take me there. To the place where we gathered high-purity ores earlier...
Paimon: Okay. Let's go! There should be a shortcut we can take!
Traveler: We're out of time.
Paimon: So we've gotta hurry... to the place where we collected the paints previously?
Mamere: #Yes... Please, {NICKNAME}, Paimon... We have to get over there...
Traveler: Even so, we won't let you off so easy!
