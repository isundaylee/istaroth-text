# The Culling of the Worms: Testing

Shriya: That was close... Even the Wenut have come to mess up our plan...
Vinayak: Hey! If we hadn't deactivated the ignition, we could have killed it!
Vinayak: Now that the Wenut has escaped, it'll be at least one more day before it lets its guard down again.
Vinayak: You're not planning to argue over the tiniest detail and let it go again tomorrow, are you?
Shriya: Um, but what about the parameters...
Vinayak: I have tested them all, and although the charging speed is a little lower than the calculated value, it does not affect use, and there are no safety risks.
Vinayak: Shriya, I know you want to consider and analyze everything before acting, but you know, things don't always go according to plan.
Vinayak: If you keep getting hung up over the small details, you'll miss the best opportunity to act! Remember that time our mid-term thesis defense got delayed? Hesitating won't get us anywhere.
Shriya: *sigh* Okay. Here's your ignition module.
Vinayak: Alright! Tomorrow, we'll finally be able to put the Wenutslayer Cannon into action!
Vinayak: I'd like to bring them back to Aaru Village and tinker around with them a little more. We gotta make sure we're properly ready for the Wenutslayer Cannon's first ever official appearance!
Shriya: ...But why is there a deviation in the environmental parameters? What caused the Wenut to suddenly act out?
Shriya: #You really can't just let these matters rest... Mr. Adventurer, could you please come back tomorrow?
Shriya: By then, we should be facing the Wenut directly, and hopefully we'll have some sort of clue.
