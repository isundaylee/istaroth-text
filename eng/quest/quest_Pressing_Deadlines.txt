# Pressing Deadlines


## Talk 1

Nervous An: Oh boy, now I'm in trouble...
Traveler: Clerk Zhao told me to give this to you...
Nervous An: Huh? She needs a report of all the ships in the harbor!?
Nervous An: This... I actually had started keeping track of this at the very start...
Nervous An: But then there's also the imported goods report, the reports on crew information, and the customs report...
Nervous An: There's just sooo much to keep track of â€” report this, record that, I simply can't keep up with it all.

## Talk 2

Traveler: Hire some help...
Nervous An: I want to, but it will take some time to find someone, so that won't help me finish the work at hand...

## Talk 3

Traveler: Just do this report that Clerk Zhao wants first.
Nervous An: Hahaha! I don't even have enough time to remember all the information I need to report, let alone fill it out...

## Talk 4

Traveler: Do the most important reports first.
Nervous An: Hmm... I think the reports are all of about equal importance.

## Talk 5

Traveler: There's no time...
Nervous An: I know, so I'm trying my best now... I'll see if I can finish all the reports.

## Talk 6

Traveler: Just go and explain the situation...
Nervous An: But I still have some time, I should just work harder to finish these reports...

## Talk 7

Traveler: I can help out.
Nervous An: Thanks for the offer, but if you aren't familiar with the work you won't be much help.

## Talk 8

Traveler: Still going to put it off to later?
Nervous An: I'll try to finish it on time, but as you can see I already have so much work to do, haha... It will be difficult to not put it off.

## Talk 9

Traveler: Then you need to figure it out yourself...
Nervous An: I know, I know... This is my job, I can't rely on other people to do it for.

## Talk 10

Traveler: Prioritize your work better next time.
Nervous An: Hahaha, I always tell myself I should, but I just get so busy that I forget to prioritize.

## Talk 11

Nervous An: There's just too much work to do in the harbor. Too much.

## Talk 12

Nervous An: I mean, you've seen how busy I am.
Nervous An: All of these different tasks to do at once, and all equally important.
Nervous An: Darn, looks like I'll simply have to put off this report to another time.

## Talk 13

Nervous An: *sigh* I thought about it, but there's just not enough time... I have to work harder.
Nervous An: I'll burn the midnight oil tonight, and tomorrow, and the day after that... see if I can finish recording all the ships in the harbor.
Nervous An: After all, this was the very first report I started working on, so it shouldn't be the last one I submit.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Jiangzhou: No, that's not quite right either...
Traveler: Clerk Zhao told me to give this to you...
Jiangzhou: Hmm? About the plans for Lantern Rite...
Jiangzhou: Ah, I'm writing that right now. But it feels like it's missing something, so I keep editing it.
Jiangzhou: Everybody needs to do their very best for a big festival like Lantern Rite. So... I can't submit this plan just yet.

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: You're running out of time...
Jiangzhou: I know I can come up with the best plan, I just need a bit more time...

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: Just submit it now.
Jiangzhou: What!? I can't carelessly submit what amounts to a rough draft, this is Liyue's most important festival!

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: It will never be perfect.
Jiangzhou: That may be true, but I should strive for perfection, no?

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: Any plan is better than no plan.
Jiangzhou: That's true, but I shouldn't submit a plan that has something wrong with it, should I?

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: There's nothing wrong with your plan.
Jiangzhou: Hmm, it may not have any glaring problems, but at least let me improve it even more.

### Additional Talk 7

Traveler: Submit it first, you can change more later.
Jiangzhou: Are you joking? Lantern Rite is a serious festival, there are procedures.

### Additional Talk 8

Traveler: Get ideas from last year's plan...
Jiangzhou: I've already been looking at last year's Lantern Rite. But... even though it was very popular among residents, I still think I can come up with something really special.

### Additional Talk 9

Traveler: Be confident...
Jiangzhou: What good is confidence if the people of Liyue don't like it?

### Additional Talk 10

Traveler: Then... keep thinking?
Jiangzhou: Yes! Give me a bit more time and I'll be able to write the perfect plan.

### Additional Talk 11

Jiangzhou: I have to give it my all for Lantern Rite. Think, Jiangzhou, think...

### Additional Talk 12

Jiangzhou: No... The people of Liyue have been eagerly looking forward to Lantern Rite.
Jiangzhou: Nobody will be satisfied if it's just a touched-up version of last year's plan.
Jiangzhou: Don't try to stop me... I still need to make some changes, need to make the perfect plan...

### Additional Talk 13

Jiangzhou: Okay then... With a bit more time, I'll touch up the plan and fix some minor issues.
Jiangzhou: I'll submit it when I'm done touching it up.
Jiangzhou: I hope everyone really enjoys this year's Lantern Rite...

### Additional Talk 14

Clerk Zhao: You're back. Thank you so much, Nervous An and Jiangzhou already sent me a message.
Clerk Zhao: They said they will definitely submit their work on time.
Clerk Zhao: Excellent... At the very least I can sleep well tonight...
Clerk Zhao: Take these as thanks. You have really been a great help.
Clerk Zhao: After this ordeal, I'm sure they won't repeat this kind of mistake again...

### Additional Talk 15

Clerk Zhao: What? They still can't finish on time?
Clerk Zhao: Another extension? Do they want to do this job or not?
Clerk Zhao: Well, never mind. I suppose I'll have to find the time to chase them myself...
Clerk Zhao: Oh, right. Take these, and thank you for your help.

### Additional Talk 16

Clerk Zhao: You're back. Nervous An and Jiangzhou just sent me a message.
Clerk Zhao: Only one of them promised they would submit their work on time, but I guess one is better than none.
Clerk Zhao: As for the other one, I'll just have to continue to press them...
Clerk Zhao: Regardless, I'm grateful for your help. Take these as thanks.

### Additional Talk 17

Clerk Zhao: Ugh... It's never a slow day at work, that's for sure...

### Additional Talk 18

Nervous An: There's still so much work, what should I do...?

### Additional Talk 19

Jiangzhou: I have to come up with the very best plan...
