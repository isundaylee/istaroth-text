Traveler: Contraband items?
Kobayashi: Um, like... compasses that automatically search for treasure, bottles that allow you to fly, or boats armed with large cannons... and things like that?
Kobayashi: I mean, I'm just guessing, really. I'm honestly not sure what counts as contraband.
Kobayashi: And I mean, even if some dangerous does get through, they'll have to face the might of the Tenryou Commission when they're in the city!
