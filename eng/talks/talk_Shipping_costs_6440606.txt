Traveler: Shipping costs?
Azalai: That's right. I mean, just look around you. There's nothing but sand over here. There isn't anything I can ship to the city to sell, so I can't really make a profit with that.
Azalai: Speaking of which, I once encountered a sandstorm while I was bringing in my goods. In the depths of the desert, I met some folks who looked like researchers.
Azalai: They shared some food with me and told me how to return to Aaru Village. However, they refused to reveal their identities.
Azalai: Should I try venturing into the desert again and look for those people? I heard that researchers are quite wealthy, so it would be nice if I could earn their Mora...
Azalai: That way, I could bring my prices down, and the people in the village would be able to live better lives.
