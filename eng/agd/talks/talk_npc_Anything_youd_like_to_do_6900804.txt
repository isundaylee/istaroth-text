# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Yelan: Isn't this your time off? You should do something that isn't too mentally taxing.
Yelan: Oh, I have some dice in my pocket. Why don't we have a little fun?
Yelan: I'll roll the dice, and the score decides who confesses.
Traveler: Score?
Yelan: If I roll a one, three, or five, you have to confess. You have to tell me... a secret that no one else can ever be allowed to know.
Yelan: If it's two, four, or six, then I'll be the one who has to reveal an important secret to you. What do you say?
Traveler: Sounds a little risky...
Yelan: In other words, you still have some reservations towards me.
Yelan: But the good news is, you passed the test. The fact that you'll keep some cards close to your chest even in front of a major ally actually makes me more confident in you.
Yelan: Maybe you'll make a successful intelligence agent yourself one day. I'm excited to go up against you.
Traveler: Let's go for it!
Yelan: Oh? So you really want to play, despite there being a fifty-fifty chance of losing?
Yelan: Or is it that you're willing to take a gamble for the sake of finding out my secrets?
Yelan: Interesting. I was going to pull a little trick, but now even I'm looking forward to this.
Yelan: Hehe... Then let round one begin.
Traveler: "Confess"?
