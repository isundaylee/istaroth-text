# Hiromi's Watch


## Talk 1

Hiromi: Yo, outlander! What are you doing sneaking around?
Traveler: I'm just passing through.
Hiromi: Don't bother me with anything unimportant, outlander. Otherwise, I'll kindly have you accompany me to the Outlander Affairs Agency.
Hiromi: I have no idea how you got here, but it's a criminal offense to interfere with a samurai's job.
Hiromi: The Kanjou Commissioner will punish you severely should he find out.
Hiromi: So I'd advise you to stay back — for your own safety.
Traveler: Kanjou Commission?
Hiromi: Are you serious? Do you outlanders not fear the Commissioner anymore nowadays?
Traveler: I don't see this place being under Kanjou jurisdiction.
Hiromi: You...!
Hiromi: You're not wrong... But even a samurai has a right to some free time. You outlanders wouldn't understand!
Traveler: You're not on the job right now, are you?
Traveler: You know, maybe you're the sneaky one here.

## Talk 2

Traveler: So, about Hiromi...
Shun: Ah, he's a good lad... But he's a big baby, too. He needs a bit more time to grow.
Shun: So I say, but in the end, being immature is better than being evil.
Shun: He has his livelihood and his responsibilities...
Shun: It's not all his fault either that he's scared to make choices.
Shun: At least he's still got some choices to make.

## Talk 3

Little Que'er: If you have anything to say, please talk to my senior disciple. I know you don't like listening to me anyway.
Little Que'er: Hmph... No one likes to listen to me...

## Talk 4

Traveler: Don't worry, just asking.
Hiromi: Please don't ask me pointless questions while I'm on duty.
Hiromi: Come on, please stop bothering me. Please leave.

## Talk 5

Sun Yu: Ah, it's you, Traveler. Your great name is known throughout Liyue Harbor. Might I inquire as to why you have elected to grace us with your...
Traveler: You're talking all funny.
Sun Yu: Ah. I am presently trying to teach Que'er how to treat people with the proper etiquette. As the saying goes, "Those without credibility have no leg to stand on, and those without etiquette..."
Traveler: Fair, but there's no need to be so formal.
Sun Yu: Alright. Then, may I help you?
Traveler: I'm looking for a certain female thief.
Sun Yu: Oh, so you have come to perform the chivalrous act of hunting down criminals. The Guhua Clan will definitely support that! What aid may we lend you?
Traveler: The two of you went after her once.
Sun Yu: Now that you mention it, I do have an impression of just such an incident.
Sun Yu: It happened about a week ago. Que'er and I were wandering these mountains and training when we were interrupted by two thieves.
Sun Yu: We rose up and made to help the adepti keep their paradise clean of such unwanted intruders...
Sun Yu: We pursued the two thieves deep into Mt. Hulao, only to see their shadows suddenly rise and fall, rise and fall...
Traveler: Then what happened...?
Sun Yu: Suddenly, one of the shadows disappeared. I said, "Que'er, this must be a trap! Don't fall for it!" Then we began to chase the female thief...
Sun Yu: We climbed Mt. Hulao through rock, stone, cave, and cloud...
Sun Yu: In short, we chased them up and down, up and down, and up and down...
Traveler: Uh huh. And then...?
Sun Yu: We heard a *puff*!
Sun Yu: And then the female thief was gone.
Sun Yu: Little Que'er and I searched for her for a long time, but we couldn't find any trace. We thought that she must have fallen off the cliffs.
Sun Yu: Or perhaps she was so agile that she gave us the slip. That's possible as well.
Sun Yu: That's all I know. I cannot be sure if it'll be of use to you, but...
Traveler: Thanks for your help!
Sun Yu: Ah, I am glad that we were able to help! By the way, I also saw a few Qingxin on the mountain's summit that seemed quite lovely — beyond the pale, even. I wonder if...
Traveler: Taking my leave now!
Traveler: No, it wasn't completely useless...
Traveler: Do you still have any impression of her?
Traveler: You were giving me goosebumps...

## Talk 6

Yan'er: *cough* *cough* *panting* Phew, thought I'd never get out!
Yan'er: Thanks for saving my life, stranger...?
Yan'er: Eh!? It's you!
Traveler: You're...
Yan'er: Aren't you that... that... !
Traveler: Oh, so it's "that"...
Yan'er: Yes! And that time in Qingce, too... that...!
Traveler: Yeah. Definitely "that."
Yan'er: Yes! That's right! So... did you get any mileage out of those Chi remains?
Traveler: Hardly.
Yan'er: Ah—hahahaha!
Yan'er: Ah, you're something, alright. So it really was you who turned my brothers inside-out back in Qingce Village.
Yan'er: Well, regardless, you have my thanks for saving my life.
Yan'er: Otherwise, I don't know how long I would have been trapped in this accursed amber. It was awful in there...
Yan'er: The vaunted adepti of Jueyun Karst — a pack of petty jerks, I tell you!
Traveler: The adeptus saved your life, you know.
Yan'er: Hehe, you're right.
Yan'er: I accidentally fell into this pit back when I was trying to avoid that crazy couple.
Yan'er: But thanks to Mountain Spitter wrapping me up in amber from way over in his abode, I wasn't injured.
Yan'er: Well, he's not an avid finisher of what he starts, seeing as how he didn't let me out afterwards.
Traveler: The adeptus was probably trying to punish you, too.
Yan'er: Makes sense, hahaha!
Yan'er: Alright, alright. I'm done laughing now. Come on, let's get out of this place.
Traveler: Just saying, you're still in their territory.
Traveler: Everything they said I would.

## Talk 7

Yan'er: So, I suppose that you've got something you need my help with, then!
Traveler: Oh, I was just passing through.
Yan'er: Hah! You can't fool me.
Yan'er: You outlanders have faces that can hide no secrets.
Traveler: Wait, how did you know?

## Talk 8

Hiromi: So, did you manage to get any news of "Big Sis"?
Traveler: We've spoken, aye.
Hiromi: What did she say? Don't tell me she's already forgotten about me?
Traveler: She doesn't know a Hiromi.
Hiromi: But...!
Traveler: Well, that's because she can't get to know any public servants.
Hiromi: ...
Traveler: Idiotic ones least of all.
Hiromi: Uhh...
Traveler: Still, she thinks that...
Hiromi: She thinks that?
Traveler: That she can give it a try.
Hiromi: Uh...?
Traveler: Sounds like a date, doesn't it?
Hiromi: Eh! Eh!? Is that how you see it?
Traveler: Is that so strange...?
Hiromi: N—No... it's just... I wasn't expecting this response.
Traveler: I'll go if you won't.
Hiromi: Wha—! No! There's no need for that! I can take care of this myself!
Hiromi: But... she didn't mention when she'll "try to get to know me," did she?
Traveler: I'm afraid she couldn't spill the beans then.
Hiromi: #Yes, you're right... Anyway, you have my thanks, Traveler.
Hiromi: Perhaps I still need time to digest everything that she said. Well, I can't claim to be disappointed with this answer either way.
Hiromi: Sorry for the trouble. Here's your payment.
Traveler: Don't forget, now: "Uyuu Restaurant."
Hiromi: I got it. Thank you!
Hiromi: #By the way, Traveler, I wish you all the best here in Inazuma.
Traveler: She is a Treasure Hoarder, after all...

## Talk 9

Traveler: What are you doing?
Hiromi: None of your business.
Hiromi: Alright, I'll... let you go this time. Just please, leave me alone.

## Talk 10

Traveler: Are you waiting for someone?
Hiromi: ... So what if I am?

## Talk 11

Hiromi: #So, Traveler, do you have any news?
Traveler: Not for the moment.
Hiromi: I see...
Hiromi: It's alright. If you find her, please inform me as soon as possible.
Traveler: I'm still working on it.

## Talk 12

Hiromi: ... Why'd you come again? If you got something to say, hurry up!
Hiromi: Don't interrupt a man while he's waiting for someone!
Traveler: Waiting for someone far outside his realm of jurisdiction?
Hiromi: What are you trying to say?
Traveler: Not some proper folk you're meeting then, eh?
Hiromi: O—Of course I wouldn't... Are you questioning a public servant?
Hiromi: I'm on duty and waiting for my informant... a contact...
Traveler: Speak up, I can barely hear you anymore.
Hiromi: Ugh, enough! Leave, or you'll be coming with me to the Outlander Affairs Agency on charges of obstructing a personnel on official duty!
Traveler: Sure.
Hiromi: !?
Hiromi: Are you not afraid of being deported by the Commissioner?
Traveler: I feel like yours is the more evident misdemeanor.
Hiromi: ...
Hiromi: ...Please don't report this matter to the Commissioner.
Hiromi: But... I still don't get it. What is it that you want to know?
Hiromi: I'm just a low-ranking officer. I don't know much beyond my duties. I don't think I'll be of much help to you.
Traveler: Well, I can help you.
Hiromi: I... can't believe an outlander would understand the honor of a samurai. You have my respect...
Traveler: Ah, a public servant and a honeyed tongue.
Hiromi: Alright, please don't mock me anymore. I sincerely apologize for my rudeness. Please accept my apology.
Hiromi: By the way, I don't believe that you've given me your name...
Traveler: #Call me Traveler.
Hiromi: #Well, Traveler, since you're willing to help, I do have something to ask of you.
Hiromi: Here's how it is. I have a childhood friend — an outlander — whom I haven't been able to meet since the Sakoku Decree came into effect.
Hiromi: I was worried about her safety, so I started putting letters into drifting bottles in hopes that she'd receive them.
Hiromi: However, she still hasn't responded.
Traveler: Drifting bottles, you say?
Traveler: You said "drifting bottles," right?
Traveler: I just can't stand the way you're going on like this.
Traveler: Oh, I have my ways.
Traveler: Why, yes! Let's go, shall we?

## Talk 13

Shun: If you've got something to say, say it fast. Us Treasure Hoarders, our time's not yours for the wastin'.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Shun: Huh? Why are you here? And who's that you've brought along?
Shun: Didn't we agree to meet alone?
Shun: Eh, I understand. But if it's about "that case," then tell your colleagues that it's not time yet.
Hiromi: This isn't about that... it's the matter from last week. The one you promised me about.
Shun: Oh? Not that case? Then which one are you talking about? I'm a law-abiding citizen these days, you know! I'm squeaky clean!
Shun: This isn't the time we agreed on, either way. I mean, I just got out of jail two weeks ago.
Shun: Oh yeah, I've got it now... are you trying to preemptively arrest me to gain some credit?
Hiromi: No, that's not it at all... And what gain would there be in catching someone like you?
Shun: Ouch! Not in the feelings, man! I'm at least a Treasure Hoarder Cadre. I'll have you know that I'm pretty well-known on the streets, too!
Shun: No, wait, I get it now! You must be—
Traveler: You're a Treasure Hoarder?
Hiromi: *sigh*
Shun: Man, not even knowing who the Treasure Hoarders are... Is your colleague over here new or something?
Hiromi: Shut up.
Hiromi: #Listen, Traveler. Shun is my informant. Please, don't make an unnecessary fuss out of this.
Hiromi: Look, Shun, I came here with this outl— I mean, friend of mine, to ask you about where "Big Sis" is. I... I want to get in touch with her again.
Shun: Oh... Hahahahhaha!
Hiromi: What on earth are you laughing at, huh? What's your issue?
Traveler: Yeah, what he said.
Shun: Hahaha, you're hilarious!
Shun: So here's the skinny, Traveler. The three of us have known each other since we were wetting beds.
Shun: This was back before the Sakoku Decree. Way before Hiromi became some stick-in-the-mud, too.
Shun: *sigh* I mean, just look at what the Commission headquarters did to a good boy like him.
Hiromi: With me, they turned a good boy into a public servant who protects the people. With him, they turned a bad boy into a Treasure Hoarder.
Shun: Alright, alright, I'll be straight with you. See, you knew who we were before the Sakoku Decree was implemented, right?
Shun: There you have it: that's why she left Inazuma.
Shun: Bet you wrote about Uyuu Restaurant in your last letter, eh? Don't worry, I miss it too.
Shun: We even had a drink there the day before the Sakoku Decree took effect.
Shun: Everyone could tell what you were thinking, trust me.
Shun: But well, isn't it a crying shame that your Shogun hates outlander drifters, eh?
Hiromi: ...Let's just get back to business.
Shun: Is any of this business?
Shun: Alright, I'm done messing with you. And I'd love to help you too, but... I don't think I can.
Hiromi: What do you mean?
Shun: ...It's a long story.
Traveler: Oh, look, my hand is itching! I think it wants to beat someone up!
Hiromi: Wow, a coincidence. Mine does too!
Shun: So, "Big Sis" and I were in Jueyun Karst not long ago. You know about Jueyun Karst, right?
Shun: Home of the adepti, shiny golden Cor Lapis, light blue Noctilucous Jade, the works...
Shun: That's where all the rare and exotic treasures gifted by heaven are buried, you know? They say that the adepti...
Traveler: Get to the point!
Shun: Oh, okay, okay. So "Big Sis" and I were casing Jueyun Karst... Everything was going well at first, and we were even able to conceal ourselves from the adepti...
Shun: We planned on treating ourselves to something nice after casing that joint, and we were just about to head back...
Shun: And then there was a whistling cry between the rocks and the sea, and two swords were drawn!
Shun: Two people leapt in front of us — one man and one woman — yelling "Bandits! There's nowhere to run!"
Shun: It was a pair of warriors from the Guhua Clan! That was it, we thought — we were done for! Oh yeah, and y'know, I've heard that man is named...
Traveler: Get. To. The. Point!
Shun: So the man's called Sun Yu and the woman's called Little Que'er.
Shun: "Big Sis" and I had to split right there. I've got no clue where she is now.
Hiromi: #Thank you, Traveler! You saved me a lot of time there...
Hiromi: The scope of our search has been narrowed down a lot. All you need to do now is... check with those two members of the Guhua Clan, and there should be hope of finding her yet.
Hiromi: This bottle and her badge... I can only rest easy after I've returned both of these to her.
Hiromi: #Traveler, I'm embarrassed to ask, but can you please help me out?
Traveler: You're not going yourself?
Hiromi: I... I have other duties. It will be hard for me to leave.
Shun: Ooh, "I have other duties." Aah, "It will be hard for me to leave~"
Shun: Hmph. You're useless!
Shun: How can you take yourself seriously, what with your pathetic salary and having to flatter your superiors constantly?
Hiromi: ...
Shun: It's getting late, anyway. You should go back to your post.
Shun: Ah, I don't know what to say... You want to be a good public servant and a lackey of the Commissioner...
Shun: Yet you can't let go of our friendship or forget the throbbing of your heart...
Shun: Even though your paths have diverged so much.
Shun: You don't have the guts to make your own choices. You're just a wuss who throws your duties to others.
Shun: ...But don't you worry, those choices will come back to you in the end.
Shun: When that time comes, you won't be able to hide anymore.
Hiromi: ...
Hiromi: ...Don't you lecture me.
Shun: That's right, that's right! How could I forget! I'm an outlander thief, and you're a public servant. You should be the one lecturing me!
Shun: Well, Traveler, looks like it's your time to save the day again.
Shun: I'm not gonna play house with this petty public servant a second longer. I've got my own job to do.
Traveler: You alright over there?
Hiromi: No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Hiromi: Well, he wasn't speaking complete nonsense.
Hiromi: #But I'm afraid that I still need you to do this for me, Traveler.
Traveler: You're as stubborn as a mule.
Hiromi: Thanks... I will seize the next opportunity when it comes along with my own hands.
Hiromi: #Well, I'd best be back soon, or my superior will get mad. Thanks again for your help, Traveler.
Hiromi: Take care of yourself! If anything urgent should crop up, you know where to find me in Ritou.
Traveler: Just this once.
Traveler: Need some help?
Traveler: Do you believe him?
Hiromi: Shun's a pain and he's by no means a good man, but I can trust him.
Shun: Hmph. Well, at least you've got a conscience.
Traveler: I've been there.
Traveler: Get to the point, please.
Traveler: An explanation would be nice, Hiromi.

### Additional Talk 2

Sun Yu: Please go after those bandits. Don't let me slow you down.
Sun Yu: Oh! I see! Then you must be here to help me—
Traveler: By your leave!

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: What are you doing here?
Shun: What else could it be? I'm one of the Treasure Hoarders, so I'm here for the treasure, of course!

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: And why won't you go inside?
Shun: Are you trying to get me killed? It's dangerous inside!
Traveler: Well, if someone were to get the treasure first...
Shun: Hah! What I don't know about can't affect my bottom line.
Shun: That's a Treasure Hoarder-patented survival technique!
Traveler: Jeez...
Shun: Hehe~

### Additional Talk 5

Hiromi: Yes, I did. What of it?
Traveler: Are you referring to this?

### Additional Talk 6

Yan'er: Well then, what's the matter? Did you finally remember that you might have to arrest me, O Hero of Liyue?
Traveler: Please take this.

### Additional Talk 7

Hiromi: This is it! Her badge is inside, too.
Hiromi: I don't know how to thank you enough...
Traveler: You wouldn't mind me reading it, would you?
Hiromi: Eh? What? Please don't...
Traveler: "Do you still remember the Uyuu Restaurant?"
Hiromi: Uh...
Traveler: "We shall meet there... "
Hiromi: Wait—
Traveler: "You will find money for wine attached herein."
Hiromi: Okay—
Traveler: "But if you are not the one I was expecting to receive this letter..."
Hiromi: #Please stop reading it! Traveler, that was very, incredibly rude of you!
Traveler: Look at you, being all serious.
Hiromi: Stop messing around! If you want to help me, just say so!
Traveler: Sorry.
Hiromi: So recently, one of her... old friends told me that she is doing well. They're both adventurers exploring the world, so I trust his intel.
Hiromi: Unfortunately, between all the duties I shoulder, it's impossible for me to venture that far out...
Hiromi: I was going to ask him to deliver my letter for me, and we agreed to meet here.
Hiromi: But all he ever thinks about is treasure. He hurriedly left for the ancient ruins on the northern part of Narukami Island... and I haven't heard from him since.
Hiromi: I've been here several times already, finding time every day to wait for him here. But I can't keep making excuses to sneak off.
Hiromi: #That's why I was hoping that you could accompany me to find him, Traveler.
Hiromi: I suspect that it would take me a lot of time just to find those ruins, were I to go by myself.
Hiromi: But with your help, we may yet save a lot of time.
Hiromi: By the way, since you already have the bottle... you can hand it over to her as well.
Hiromi: #Traveler, can I count on you for this?
Traveler: Alright.
Hiromi: Aye aye, let's head out at once!
Traveler: Let's find him.
Traveler: Please continue.
Traveler: Were you like that when you were writing these letters, too?

### Additional Talk 8

Yan'er: Oh, is this a gift? Thanks!
Traveler: It's from Hiromi.
Yan'er: Hiromi... who's that?
Traveler: Don't you know each other?
Yan'er: Sorry. I don't know any officer who catches thieves.
Yan'er: Especially idiots. I don't know any of them.
Yan'er: However... please thank him for returning the badge.
Yan'er: Also, the Uyuu Restaurant seems like a fine place. I will go there for drinks when I am free.
Yan'er: Go for a few drinks and get to know that idiot along the way.
Traveler: He said he misses you.
