Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm... please take this.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I heard that the maple leaves back home have already turned red. I want to go back and take a look, but it's a long journey. I can't return for now...
Kaedehara Kazuha: I was wandering the market the other day and saw these well-preserved maple leaves, so I bought some.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Although I can't confirm whether they're from my hometown, they still help blunt my homesickness.

Traveler: Don't worry about it.
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...Thank you.

Traveler: I sympathize with you.
Traveler: It looks quite beautiful.

Kaedehara Kazuha: The maple leaves are a crimson sunset and fall like scarlet rain.
Kaedehara Kazuha: A thick layer of fallen leaves on the ground, the chirping of autumn insects, and the wandering birds...
