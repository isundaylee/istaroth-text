# Changchang's Little Friend


## Talk 1

Changchang: Ah, how am I going to feed it...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Changchang: I'm wondering how to feed the puppy that I met earlier.
Changchang: Granddad said before that the city was in too much of a mess, and he wouldn't let me go feed it.
Changchang: Although he says that everything's fine in the city now, he's been too busy to take me there...
Changchang: We haven't fed that puppy for so long... I hope it hasn't starved yet. Granddad says that puppies can find food for themselves, but I'm worried.
Changchang: Could you help me go to the city gate and feed my puppy?
Traveler: Gotcha.
Changchang: Yay! Thanks!
Traveler: What should I feed it?
Changchang: Granddad usually prepares the doggy food, but it's Fowl... I think.
Changchang: Um, then... Could you help me get a portion of Fowl to feed our puppy with?
Changchang: Please hurry â€” I... I don't want it to starve...
Traveler: I've got a fear of dogs...
Changchang: Oh, don't be scared! It's a good puppy, it won't bite you.
Changchang: I'm counting on you, then!

## Talk 3

Changchang: Have you fed our puppy yet?
Traveler: It should have eaten its fill.
Changchang: #Thanks so much, {M#Sir}{F#Ma'am}!
Changchang: Here, this is for you. I saved it up myself just to thank you!
Changchang: Granddad should be here in a few days to take me to go feed it.
