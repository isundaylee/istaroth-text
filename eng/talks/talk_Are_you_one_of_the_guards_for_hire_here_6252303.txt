Traveler: Are you one of the guards for hire here?
Dip Yeuk: Ah, right! Gotta be honest with you, I'm still new here at the Secure Transport Agency, and my kung fu still isn't up to snuff. I gotta practice, slowly improve myself...
Dip Yeuk: Oh, other than guarding transports, I'm also the drummer of the Mighty Mythical Beasts. No worries, though, Gaming's walked me through it, and I've been practicing the basics every day...
Dip Yeuk: If you've got some time to spare, you gotta come see it! We've got nothin' but 5-star reviews from everyone in town!
