# Farewell to the Past


## Talk 1

Paimon: We should go. Let's keep following the traces.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Very well. Based on my investigation so far, I believe this next pack of monsters should be the last.

## Talk 2

Raiden Shogun (Ei): Ugh...
Paimon: Are you alright?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): I'm fine, I...

## Talk 3

Fukami: Protect the Almighty Shogun!

## Talk 4

Raiden Shogun: In the end, even the proud and mighty oni maiden was cut down and disgraced...
Raiden Shogun: Though your blade has been cleansed of her blood and filth, never shall it shine as brightly as it once did.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Ugh... Paimon's dizzy, where did we get sucked into this time...
Paimon: Whoa! This place...
Traveler: It does look a lot like the Plane of Euthymia.
Paimon: Look! Look, over there!
Paimon: It's another Ei!
Raiden Shogun: We meet again, Traveler.
Raiden Shogun: This body is an assistant to the one within. But it is also the guardian of the rules.
Raiden Shogun: Should the one within wish to stray from the rules, this body shall stand in her way.
Paimon: Wait, Paimon knows that voice... is that... the puppet!?
Raiden Shogun: You have wandered the realm in my body, and you appear to have grasped the true essence of eternity.
Raiden Shogun: You believe your present self has greater certainty than your former self. Thus, you believe your present self is correct. Don't you?
Raiden Shogun: But have you really been enlightened with new ideas? Or have you been degraded by irreversible erosion?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): I'm here to show you my answer.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): We are both warriors, and the dialogue we must now have shall be conducted by the blade alone.
Paimon: Uhhh, wait, wait, wait, the atmosphere in here just took a turn for the worse!
Paimon: A—Are you, uh, are you alright now?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): The discomfort I was experiencing earlier was caused by the Shogun rejecting my continued use of her body.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): As she indicates, once I started entertaining the idea of change, I became hostile in her eyes.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): But inside a realm of consciousness, I exist independently of her. She cannot affect me in this way.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Though she is a puppet, the Shogun has her own consciousness, too. When necessary, she appears here to confront me.
Traveler: I think you've mentioned this before...
Paimon: Uh... Paimon gets that everyone has their internal battles and stuff, but... not like this! It's a bit extreme!
Paimon: Ei's showdown with the Shogun... Never thought we'd see that day.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): The rules I set for the Shogun are... no, the Shogun herself is the manifestation of my past ideals, the very foundation stone of eternity. It shall not be easily swayed.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): I would not try to change her if it wasn't necessary.
Paimon: Isn't there any other way? Can't you... talk it through? ...Or something?
Traveler: Ei isn't someone who leaves herself an escape route.
Paimon: But they both just want the best for Inazuma...
Raiden Shogun: My form is a symbol of supreme majesty, in which has been vested power over all the realm. It is the cohesive embodiment of all that constitutes the "Raiden Shogun."
Raiden Shogun: It inherits Ei's pain — the pain of inevitable loss that comes as she moves forward. So too does it inherit her determination to reach eternity.
Raiden Shogun: Every action undertaken is for the sake of resisting erosion.
Raiden Shogun: Determination, courage, love, hatred... All of these will be degraded and distorted by the incessant flow of time.
Raiden Shogun: Only rules shall remain constant for eternity.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Those were my thoughts when I created you.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Now they are towering obstacles that I have no choice but to overcome.
Raiden Shogun: You wish to make yourself my enemy?
Raiden Shogun: I am your past, the everlasting law, the guardian of eternity.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): And I am she who promised a dream to her subjects... Raiden Ei.
Traveler: This is her system to safeguard against modifications to eternity?

## Talk 6

Paimon: Have you finally defeated her?
Raiden Shogun: It appears your martial prowess has not dulled.
Raiden Shogun: But how long can your will remain strong?
Paimon: How the heck...
Traveler: Surely the Shogun puppet isn't invincible...?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): In this realm of consciousness, her existence is tenacious indeed.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): She was built to resist erosion. Her will is stronger than any other living being's, including you and me.
Paimon: Then... does that mean this is gonna be a never-ending battle?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Maybe. But I have to prove to her that my present will is no product of erosion. The future I shall forge will be a grand undertaking, one that will be resistant to erosion.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): If I don't do this, the Shogun's rules can never change, and Inazuma can never move forward.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): This is my duty. No matter how long this battle may last, months, years, centuries... And no matter how many times we must fight, I will defeat her.
Traveler: What will happen to Inazuma in the meantime?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Five hundred years ago, humanity proved their strength in battle.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Here in the present, they rely on their ambition to challenge wayward practices, tear them out like the diseased wood of an old sakura tree, so that new, healthy branches might spring to life in their place.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): It is about time that I learned to trust them.
Traveler: But can you bear to leave humanity to go alone?
Raiden Shogun (Ei): I understand that. But if the dreams of which Makoto spoke are true eternity, a short moment for which the Shogun does not exist is nothing to fear.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): I fight for the everlasting future of Inazuma. However long the battle may last, it is but a drop in the ocean of eternity.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): I vow to the subjects of Inazuma that I shall one day return. This is my oath. Please be my witness.
Raiden Shogun (Ei): During my absence, I place everything in Miko's hands.
Paimon: But, but this means that—
Raiden Shogun (Ei): Pass on my words.
Traveler: Ei!
Paimon: Whoa!
Traveler: Everyone looks to the Shogun for hope.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Looks like we got kicked out...
Paimon: What do we do? Are we really just gonna leave Ei and the Shogun to keep on duking it out in there forever!?
Paimon: She was making sense, and maybe this is the only way to change the Shogun's rules, but still...
Traveler: Ei has no physical body anymore, and has to rely on the Shogun.
Paimon: Right? Also, Ei can be pretty stubborn at times, and has a history of rushing into difficult situations...
Paimon: What if she gets too obsessed with winning, and she forgets why she's there in the first place? It could happen... And then she might never leave again!
Traveler: We're not about to leave her just yet.
Paimon: Yeah! We should help her out, like we did last time. The quicker she gets through this, the better.
Paimon: Is there any way we can cut down how long she needs to spend in there? Or, y'know, help her win the fight?
Traveler: Umm...
Paimon: Well, whatever, we can't let anything bad happen to Ei while she's in there!
Paimon: ...Oh, but we also can't get in there anymore.
Paimon: Okay, well first things first, we gotta find a way back in! C'mon brain juice, don't fail Paimon now! Um, okay, maybe if we both ram into it at the same time, really really hard—
Traveler: We need to talk to Yae Miko.
Paimon: Oh, you're right! Paimon nearly forgot about her!
Paimon: Who knows if she really understands these consciousness realm-plane thingies more than we do... But there's no one else we can turn to. Alright, up the mountain we go!
Traveler: Our work here isn't done.
Traveler: But this cannot be the only way...

## Talk 8

Observe Teacup: (A cup of tea has been left for Furuyama.)
Observe Teacup: (How much did he actually perceive, and how much did he let on?)
