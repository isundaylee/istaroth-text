Traveler: Uh, so, about your boss...
Genzou: What's with the suspicious tone? You think we're impostors?
Genzou: I am a Shogunate officer, and this is my identification! Don't you dare be so rude!
Genzou: As for Lord Terada, his status exceeds mine. How can the likes of you question his authority?

Genzou: Ever since I started serving Lord Terada, I've never spent another day maintaining order, risking my life amidst the horrors of war, or going hungry.
Genzou: There's no boss in the world who's better than him, so don't you dare make any trouble for him, you hear me?
