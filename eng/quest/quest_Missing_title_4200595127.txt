# Missing title (4200595127)

Traveler: Can you tell another story?
Tea Master Liu Su: Another one? But I was just getting to the good part in The Wrath of Haishan...
Tea Master Liu Su: I'll tell you what, I was going to narrate this one some time soon, it's Legend of the Shattered Halberd. If you're that desperate for a new story, you can take it.
Tea Master Liu Su: But I must say, reading a book can't compare to the experience of having it narrated to you by a professional orator. So I would encourage you to come and listen in some time.
