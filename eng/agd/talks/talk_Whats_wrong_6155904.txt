Traveler: ...What's wrong?
Lorgar: Your attire... Could you be the traveler they spoke of?
Lorgar: Huh? You don't? Your heroic deeds have already spread across Mondstadt. I heard that it was you who put an end to the storms that terrorized Mondstadt!
Lorgar: Though I believe you're capable of dealing with the monsters ahead, I'd still like to ask you to watch out and take care.
