## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: Pull the lever.
Paimon: #Whoa! What are you doing, {NICKNAME}?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): You pull the lever without the slightest hesitation.\nThe entire tower then immediately trembles with a thunderous, ear-splitting rumble. It's as if the sky is crumbling and the earth is splitting...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): Then... with a pop, the machine spits out a stack of paper tape right into your hands.\nAll is quiet once more.
Paimon: Is... this it?
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon doesn't have a clue what's on this stuff, but it looks pretty important...
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, why don't we keep this paper tape for now? Who knows, it might come in handy later...

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: We probably shouldn't touch it...
Paimon: #R... Right. It does seem dangerous... {NICKNAME}, maybe we should take a step back...

### Additional Talk 3

Paimon: Huh? It's a console just like the one in that other tower from before...
Research Terminal: (There's a memo stuck next to the lever on the right side of the console. In neat and elegant handwriting, it reads, "Do NOT touch under any circumstances!")
Traveler: Pull the lever.
Black Screen Text: You pull the lever.\nJust like before, the machine spits out a stack of paper tape after a moment of rumbling and shaking...
Paimon: Hmm, it's paper tape, just like before...
Paimon: Paimon still doesn't get it, but we should probably take it with us in case we need it later.

### Additional Talk 4

Paimon: What do we have here... Right, looks like a lever with "Do NOT touch under any circumstances!" written next to it!
Traveler: Pull the lever.
Black Screen Text: You pull the lever.\nAfter some rumbling and shaking, the machine spits out a stack of paper tape...
Paimon: Great! Now we have the monitoring data from the Pate de Fruit Station!
Paimon: Paimon still doesn't get it, but we should probably take this stuff with us in case we need it later.

### Additional Talk 5

Paimon: What do we have here... Right, looks like it's this lever with "Do NOT touch under any circumstances!" written next to it!
