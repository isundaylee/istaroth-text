Traveler: Having fun on the beach?
Will: Yep! The scenery is soooo different from Mondstadt.
Will: I even caught a fish! Fish skin is slippery, so they're super hard to catch... Well, harder than catching crabs anyway. That's what Jill does.
Will: But anyway, I don't have a bowl to put this fish in. So why don't you take it?

Traveler: You kids be careful playing on the beach, now.
Will: I'll be fine!
Will: But Mr. Guard keeps following us and Jill's scared to death.
Will: D'you think he's one of those, y'know... bad men who... who... make little kids... learn to read and write, and give them too much homework?
Will: We were gonna go and play with Ms. Edith at Windrise, but now we're stuck here hiding...

Traveler: Know much about Falcon Coast?
Will: I love Falcon Coast!
Will: Granny always takes me there to play, ever since I was teeny tiny.
Will: Wow... I love your hair! It looks all soft like the nicest sand on the beach! Can I touch it?
