# Chasm Spelunkers


## Talk 1

Zhiqiong: Phew, this air sure is familiar! It's been a long time since I came down into these mines.
Jinwu: Don't get careless, Qiong. I for one smell something unfamiliar.
Zhiqiong: I mean, we couldn't jump straight down. Maybe we were just distracted by the swaying of the crane.
Jinwu: You... You've spent too much time above ground.
Paimon: Paimon didn't smell anything at all... Do all of you miners have such keen noses?
Zhiqiong: Haha! A lack of a good nose could forfeit you your life down here! That said, we should still be fine. The finches are still quite lively.
Jinwu: Look, the Lumenspar has grown all the way down here too. That wasn't the case the last time we came down here.
Zhiqiong: Wow, that really did happen! Let's go have a look!
Paimon: Y'know... it feels like someone just stole Paimon's thunder.

## Talk 2

Jinwu: To think that Lumenspar would appear so close to the surface. I was always of the opinion that these things could not appear in more structurally vulnerable locations.
Zhiqiong: They are fragments of that "thing" underground, traveling up the veins of the rock before finally arriving here.
Jinwu: Hey! Stop spouting nonsense. They were originally rocks from the local area, which is why they became like this. They just underwent some kind of transformation process and formed crystals, that's all.
Jinwu: The analyses that the Qixing commissioned us to conduct reveal that they are by and large made of ore from the local area. They've just been affected by some outside force, thus creating these strange crystals.
Paimon: #Huh, look over there! That crystal looks just like the Adjuvant you have with you, Traveler!
Paimon: #Why don't you take the Lumenstone Adjuvant and have a look, Traveler?
Jinwu: That's right. The Adjuvant is made of the same material as these crystals. These formations will thus naturally react to one another on account of that similarity.
Traveler: How very strange...
Paimon: Hey, is that all you have to say?
Jinwu: Um, don't fight, you two...
Traveler: We're not fighting...
Paimon: Yeah, we're not...
Jinwu: What I mean to say is that it doesn't matter whether you're fighting or not. Zhiqiong and I need to set up a temporary camp up ahead, so don't run off while we're doing that.
Jinwu: The crystals we discovered will be very useful for our subsequent exploration. If you find anything after this, please make sure to contact me.
Jinwu: My skills haven't rusted away just yet, so I can help you process some of the raw ore. I believe that it'll prove quite useful to you in your adventures.
Jinwu: And, um, also... don't fight, alright?
Paimon: Got it, got it!
Traveler: Understood.
Jinwu: That's a good pair of kiddos. I'll get you some candy later. Anyway, if you find anything strange nearby, please report it in a timely fashion.
Zhiqiong: Actually, do you remember what Jinwu said the last time about Uncle He...
Jinwu: #I haven't forgotten. And since you're here, Traveler, could you help me out once again?
Jinwu: Uncle He is our senior here in the mines. Several years ago, he was one of those who went missing when we Chasm miners were dispersed. He's hard of hearing, and may not have heard the alerts.
Jinwu: The pensions from Huishan Hall and Shenglu Hall are quite generous, and his family has already long arranged for his funeral... But although I'm not much of a believer in the supernatural, I can't help but feel that he's still alive down here somewhere.
Jinwu: He really was an old hand. Whether it be avoiding disasters in the mine, how to escape, how to wait for rescue... He knew it all. Taught me a lot of it, too.
Jinwu: That's why I believe that he must be alive in here somewhere, even now... I won't give up searching for him.
Jinwu: I'll point you to a few places where he was sighted before we dispersed... Who knows? You might still be able to find some clues there.
Zhiqiong: As for me, I'll be exploring the deeper parts of the mining caverns.
Jinwu: Oh yes, don't forget your candy, now!
Traveler: You're not coming with us?
Jinwu: She still needs to help us draw some maps. The pathways of The Chasm's underground mines are intricate and complex, and we won't get very far at all without those maps.
Traveler: Stay safe.
Zhiqiong: I'll be fine. It's not like I'm an amateur or anything. Don't you worry about me!
Traveler: That's pretty amazing...

## Talk 3

Jinwu: Oh, you're back.
Traveler: Uncle He left this behind.
Jinwu: Huh? He did, did he? Go on then, tell me!
Black Screen Text: You tell Jinwu about what you found earlier.
Jinwu: Umm... Black Magma... Lumenstone... and mushrooms?
Jinwu: Huh. That's weird, and a familiar sort of weird, too. Let's head back to the encampment. It would be best not to linger here.

## Talk 4

Jinwu: Here we are. Strange... where'd Zhiqiong run off to...
Jinwu: Hey! Zhiqiong! Zhiqiong!
Jinwu: *sigh* I'll wager she's gone running off to some other corner of this place to draw her maps again...
Traveler: What's up?
Jinwu: She drew this just after you left.
Jinwu: She's probably gone deeper in to explore. Please tell her for me that she should quit leaving everyone else behind to go running off by herself.
Jinwu: If anything bad happens, we're all gonna get dragged down with her. Jinwu's fist will know no mercy, I tell you.
Paimon: That sounds... scary...
Traveler: Pretty scary indeed.
Jinwu: Alright, then. Less idle talk, more action. You can either help me set up here, or you can go scout ahead.
Jinwu: Sorry if I'm not the most courteous character. I just want the things I do to be of use to everyone.
Jinwu: Ah yes, by the way, if you see some raw Lumenstone ore along the way, bring some to me.
Jinwu: I will find some way to turn them into more effective Adjuvants. As far as my experience can tell me, these things will be very useful down in the mines.
Traveler: Is Zhiqiong in danger?
Jinwu: Not yet, no. But if she keeps running off without informing me, she will be quite soon!

## Talk 5

Billboard: "Don't slip and fall!"
Billboard: (A picture of a person plunging into the depths is crudely drawn on the notice board.)

## Talk 6

Please Note!: "Stay safe while you use heavy machinery!"
Please Note!: "Do not use any heavy machinery to move the Lumenspar discovered in the depths of The Chasm!"

## Talk 7

Zhiqiong: #Ah, it's you, Traveler! You're here!
Traveler: Jinwu has some words for you...
Zhiqiong: It's that whole spiel about safety again, isn't it? I'm sick of hearing it already.
Zhiqiong: I grew up in the mines too. What wouldn't I know about the hazards down here, huh?
Zhiqiong: As for any unknown dangers... Eh, our seniors always used to use their experience to judge whether things were dangerous or not. And in the end, they'd use the results to rationalize their experiences instead.
Zhiqiong: I've had it up to here with their arrogance. I'm sure you feel similarly as a senior adventurer, don't you?
Zhiqiong: If Iris was able to scare you off climbing Dragonspine just by giving you the standard safety talk, you would've missed out on so much adventure!
Zhiqiong: Alright, stop trying to persuade me. I don't want to argue with you over something this dumb. Can we just, you know, change the topic?
Zhiqiong: I mean, look over here. I'm currently studying the terrain over here, all the better to draw our maps...
Zhiqiong: It's just that... I found that the way ahead is blocked by some... strange stuff.
Zhiqiong: If you could take some samples or pictures of it, I'm sure that both the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Adventurers' Guild would be quite pleased.
Zhiqiong: I would have done it, but... I dropped my Kamera while descending into the mines, so I can only rely on you now, hehe!
Zhiqiong: Also, there are a few other spots... Yup. Here, and here. I found the tracks of Treasure Hoarders in these areas...
Paimon: Sorry, which place is where now? Paimon didn't understand you at all!
Traveler: You just drew a bunch of Xs and lines...
Zhiqiong: Hahaha, sorry... Just a force of habit. I always forget that not everyone is born with a natural instinct for cartography.
Zhiqiong: But it's alright, I will follow you and show the way ahead.
Zhiqiong: We can approach any of these few locations first, so pick whichever you like.
Traveler: In that case, let's go.
Traveler: Be careful while we're on the move.
Zhiqiong: Thanks for your concern! I'll keep that in mind.
Traveler: What are you doing here again?
Zhiqiong: Well, didn't I just say so? I'm studying the terrain and drawing a map.

## Talk 8

Zhiqiong: This is all thanks to you. Please, take this.
Traveler: Thank you.
Zhiqiong: Ah, come on, there's no need to be so polite. I mean, Khedive's the one forking out the Mora! Oh, wait, shh... Best we be quiet, lest that stingy scholar from Sumeru hears us.
Zhiqiong: *cough* Ahem. Shall we go and look for Jinwu? We can probably probe her experienced mind concerning some of the questions we had on the way.
Zhiqiong: Alright, I won't keep you any longer.

## Talk 9

Jinwu: Ah, you're here. What is it? Would you like me to refine your Lumenstone Adjuvant?
Traveler: Refine the Adjuvant
Traveler: See you.

## Talk 10

Billboard: "Watch out for falling rocks!"

## Talk 11

Jinwu: I believe that Zhiqiong should more or less be done with the map by the time you return.
Jinwu: However, I still need to wait for the transport team above ground to shift our tools down here, so you're free to explore for the time being.

## Talk 12

Notice: This is the engineering operations center. All uninvolved personnel, please stay out!
Notice: "Most of the engineering platforms and the related machinery have been dismantled. All involved personnel, please return to the surface to await further instructions."

## Talk 13

Diary Fragment: "The light is fading... My crystal lamp should last for another 4 hours..."
Diary Fragment: "...There's not much food left. I should be able to find the water filter from memory, but we must find a new source of light..."
Diary Fragment: "Huh, those lights are floating... or are they walking? Am I starting to see things due to a lack of oxygen?"

## Talk 14

Diary Fragment: "Some strange black magma is oozing out of the depths of the earth. I'm not sure if calling it 'magma' is precise... But it looks very ominous. Best not to get near it..."
Diary Fragment: "...I went deeper still and retrieved some strange mushrooms. I'm not certain if they are edible or not..."
Diary Fragment: "...The 'magma' seems to have attracted some elemental lifeforms. Now, if they can eat it, perhaps I could too..."
Diary Fragment: "...No, something's wrong. Something's gone wrong with those little things. I'd better leave. This is surely not to be taken for sustenance..."
Diary Fragment: "...once you get used to it, mushrooms actually don't taste too bad. It might be best to relocate to a spot where mushrooms might be found and to make camp there..."

## Talk 15

Diary Fragment: "...When I get too near to the black magma, my thoughts grow jumbled and my senses become agitated. But when I stand close to these crystals, these deleterious effects retreat greatly..."
Diary Fragment: "...I once heard Little Jinwu say that some... 'Adjuvant' thing can be used to store energy from these crystals. I should ask her about that when I get back to the surface..."
Diary Fragment: "...My ears itch. I can hear someone calling out to me, telling me that there is water in the depths. Mushrooms..."
Diary Fragment: "...Oh dear. I fear that I must be going quite insane..."

## Talk 16

Damaged Logs: (An aged diary. The pages bear some strange purple-black burn marks.)
Damaged Logs: "...The excavation team shall be disbanded today, and once the collected data has been properly organized, it shall be handed over to the messenger from Huishan Hall tomorrow. Additionally, we have found that the office door has been opened three times. It may be the work of Treasure Hoarders, so everyone must stay on alert..."
Damaged Logs: "The detailed data has been sent to the secretary at Yujing Terrace such that the long-term implications for the Chasm may be estimated... A strange black mud-like substance was also discovered..."
Damaged Logs: "...Purple-black mud... below... people... something came through the crack in the door..."

## Talk 17

Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: "We, the Chasm Exploration Team, have made this place our temporary base camp. All members, please pay attention to act within safety parameters at all times. Do not act alone without permission, and do not touch any unknown materials within the depths of The Chasm!"
Traveler: Continue Reading...
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: "Recently, we have discovered an unknown black mud-like substance in part of the main mining area. It is exceedingly dangerous. All spelunkers must be on double guard. Be sure to avoid areas tainted by this substance. If you have any questions, please ask Zhiqiong to show you the way around."
Traveler: Continue Reading...
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: "Taliesin's shoes have gotten wet. Could we ask the resupply team to send down some changes of clothes and shoes?"
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: "Also, Jinwu needs a set of backup tools with which to process the Lumenstone Adjuvants. Could the resupply team please send these over as soon as possible? Thanks!"
Traveler: Continue Reading...
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: (This half-torn sheet of paper is filled with complex mathematical workings and geometry. They seem to have something to do with astrology...)
Traveler: Continue Reading...
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: "The 'Mountainator' cannon within the main mining area seems to remain undamaged. We should be able to use this to open up a path and save ourselves significant amounts of time exploring this place."
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: "However, we need to first clear the area of roving bandits. Fortunately, there's good news: the Millelith are already on the move cutting off their links with Treasure Hoarders on the surface."
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: "If their connection to the surface is cut, the Treasure Hoarders underground will likely fall back of their own accord..."
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: "We need more supplies of vegetables. Also, having stayed down here without sunlight for too long, everyone needs eggs, mushrooms, and fish to keep themselves nourished."
Traveler: Continue Reading...
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: (This notice is very old indeed. It seems to have been put up by miners well before the exploration team ever arrived on the scene.)
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: "The mines are a sprawling, complex place. Ensure that you carry a finch cage with you at all times while navigating any narrow spaces within in case of any leakage of poisonous or flammable gasses! Do not forget what our comrade Erge taught us!"
Traveler: Continue Reading...
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: (The edges of this incomplete sheet of paper have been charred a deep brown. It seems that someone read this under torchlight without keeping a safe distance...)
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: "All miners have been equipped with specialized crystal lamps, so please do not bring flaming torches down into the mines. Additionally, professionals will direct you as to where you might start a fire. Please do not strike camp by yourself if you are unfamiliar with the terrain..."
Traveler: Continue Reading...
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: "Please observe strict order while you disperse. Take your personal belongings with you and do not panic. Once the signal arrives from the surface, you may start leaving gradually in small groups!"
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: "As for all those who have gone too near to the 'crystal fragment,' please report to the medical team immediately, regardless of whether you had a negative reaction or not, and leave The Chasm as soon as possible!"
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: "Comrades, please do not panic and follow the higher-ups' announcements!"
Traveler: Continue Reading...
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: (This announcement and the messages written under it have been partially covered by newer notices. This might have been put up not long after the mines were sealed.)
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: "After the 'crystal fragment' was discovered, the amount of Lumenstone Ore present increased rapidly. As for its benefits or potential risks, we require the exploration team to further confirm them..."
Traveler: Continue Reading...
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: (This old namelist seems to have been left here by the very first exploration team sent after the mine was sealed.)
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: "We would like to invite the following professional staff to set up camp here to take samples, do research and learn how we might appropriately utilize Lumenstone:"
Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard: "...Deputy Research Director, Jinwu. Experiment Assistant, Azadi... Explorers, He Zhi, He Wei..."

Zhiqiong: You know something? Jinwu doesn't like talking about this, but just like how you're famous for your exploits on Dragonspine, she was also quite the famous figure down at the mines... *cough*
Zhiqiong: I heard that she helped to guide the Millelith search parties, and that they saved a lot of people together. Still, those things are in the past now. I shan't mention them too much, lest she gets mad again.
Zhiqiong: Alright, I won't keep you any longer.
