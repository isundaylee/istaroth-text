# Chevalmarin Amusement Park Commemorative Map

A memento to remind you of the roaring success that you and your companions achieved with the Chevalmarin Film Fantasyland. You drew this map together in a whimsical, storybook style, ensuring every enchanting attraction and adorable landmark stands out. Of course, the most important features are the friends who came to visit. Following Furina's advice, you added a snowy white beard to her portrait, like a coating of sweet cream, making sure the entire map "sounds delicious"...
