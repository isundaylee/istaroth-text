Tahmures: It was indeed the right decision to not wait for them.

Traveler: And who's "them"?
Tahmures: What a bunch of slowpokes... I wrote to the Akademiya to request an archaeological team forever ago.
Tahmures: As expected, they've made absolutely no progress. I haven't seen a single person from that team.
Tahmures: In Natlan, where you stumble upon a Saurian relic every three steps and a Saurian ruin every ten, a delay of even a single day is a huge loss!

Traveler: See you around.
Tahmures: See ya! Don't forget, time waits for no one!

Traveler: And so you acted on your own?
Tahmures: I'd like to call it "seizing a great academic opportunity with great precision."
Tahmures: The Children of Echoes and their Saurian partners are all very adept at digging, so I hired the seasoned Mr. Akeor as my archaeological partner.
Tahmures: And not to brag, but what we've found is already enough to sustain at least a year's academic work for me.
Tahmures: Still, we've got to hurry. The people of Natlan have long gotten used to living around these ruins, so they often just use the antiques they find as daily tools.
Tahmures: ...I'll write another letter to the Akademiya, if for nothing else than the hope that they'll convince the locals to stop using priceless relics to build up their walls.

Tahmures: ...But in all honesty, I feel a sense of urgency to get on with my research. When they pick up antiques, the people of Natlan tend to just use them as tools... It's genuinely terrifying to watch.
Tahmures: But you know how things have been in Natlan lately. Akeor already went off to fight the monsters with his Saurian, and I couldn't allow my personal affairs to cause a delay to his mission.
Tahmures: And it seems like my research could actually help him out on the battlefield... That really would be amazing if so.
