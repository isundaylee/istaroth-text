# Talk Dialog

Nahida: You're back! Here, let's share this Candied Ajilenakh Nut.
Traveler: Were you waiting for me?
Nahida: Hehe, now who's the mind reader?
Traveler: Did you have a happy birthday?
Nahida: Of course! It was amazing! It's like I was surrounded by everyone's kindness and warmth, like a little bird tucked away in a nest.
Nahida: I really can't thank everyone enough... the Aranara, the Pari, my dear friends.
Nahida: That said... You're still hiding something from me, aren't you?
Traveler: Aâ€”Am I...?
Nahida: Don't worry.
Nahida: If you think it should be kept a secret, then I trust your judgment.
Nahida: After all, you're my Knight of Flowers.
Traveler: Did you have a good time at the banquet?
Nahida: Of course! Every dish was such a pleasant surprise. I never knew what to expect... like trying to guess the flavor of Yalda Candies before opening the box!
Nahida: I wasn't really focused on the food, though. One look at everyone's happy faces, and I was already more than satisfied.
Nahida: After all, it's not the food that makes a banquet. It's the company!
Traveler: I should go...
Nahida: Okay! Who knows... Maybe the next time you see me, it'll be in one of your dreams, hehe!
