## Small Gear

A small gear. No matter how small a gear is, it can be of use sometime, perhaps?

## Medium Gear

A medium gear. "The pivotal one," as we call it.

## Drive Gear

A gear that can transmit a measure of force. After all, momentum is key.

## Large Gear

A large gear. Its weight and the noise it emits will make an impression for sure.

## Duplex Gear

A rather small duplex gear. Double the flanks, double the labor hours.

## Large Duplex Gear

A fairly large duplex gear. The bigger the size is, the more it takes to manufacture.

## Driven Gear

A gear that requires power to rotate. It can be very helpful. Really. Can someone help rotate it, please?
