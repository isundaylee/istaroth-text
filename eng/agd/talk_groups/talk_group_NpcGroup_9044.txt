Traveler: Do you like it here?
Xinyan: Yeah! There's enough space and freedom — what a great rehearsal venue!
Traveler: Can I watch you rehearse?
Xinyan: Uhh... If it's alright, I'd rather perform for you after I practice up.
Xinyan: That'll give you the best listenin' experience.
Xinyan: But thanks for your cheers! I'll do my best!
Xinyan: Oh, right! After each rehearsal, I make sure to tidy up after myself.
Xinyan: Don't worry, I'll have this place like new!
Traveler: Thanks for liking it here...
Xinyan: Hey, what are you sayin'?
Xinyan: If anything, I ought to be the one thanking YOU! Inviting me to your house, not tellin' me what I can and can't do.

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Xinyan: Sure! I've got some serious writer's block... Help me think it through!
Traveler: You write your own songs?
Xinyan: Naturally!
Xinyan: In Liyue Harbor, rock 'n' roll is considered niche. There's a lot of fans of the music, but few creators of it.
Xinyan: Although I listen to songs from Fontaine, that's just appreciation and learnin'.
Xinyan: When it's time for creation, you gotta do it yourself to live up to the words "rock 'n' roll"!
Traveler: That's amazing!
Xinyan: Hehe, thanks for your appreciation.
Xinyan: But... I've been kinda worried lately.
Xinyan: For my newest song, fans say they can "hear tenderness within the searin' flames." They think my style has changed...
Xinyan: Maybe it's because of recent changes in my heart. Ugh, should I not let that happen...?
Traveler: In the past, what sort of themes did you start with?
Xinyan: Overcomin' prejudice, of course!
Xinyan: What I heard and saw in the streets, combined with my personal experiences...
Xinyan: Narration, lyrics... The most important thing is to have enough passion to question everything!
Xinyan: You gotta point right towards the soul!
Traveler: Anything on your mind lately?
Xinyan: Well...

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Xinyan: Hm... Wanna try out the lyre?
Xinyan: You've seen and heard so many of my shows.
Xinyan: If you're interested and wanna give it a fair go, I can teach you step by step!
Traveler: I've learned how to play instruments before.
Xinyan: Wow, really? That's great!
Xinyan: Oh, at least for me, rock 'n' roll is somethin' as important as life itself.
Xinyan: If I could perform rock 'n' roll with you, that'd be twice as— no, the best thing in this world!
Xinyan: O—Of course, I know that our music tastes won't be the same. The "rock 'n' roll" I'm thinkin' of here isn't limited to the music itself.
Xinyan: If there's a part of you that's unwillin', I definitely won't force ya!
Traveler: For you, I'll try...
Xinyan: Aw...
Xinyan: Then I gotta live up to your faith in me and be a good teacher!
Xinyan: Here, this is my lyre.
Xinyan: Now get ready to train hard, because I'm about to turn up the heat!
Traveler: Maybe we can find another way of interpreting rock 'n' roll?
Xinyan: No. Prob. Lem!
Xinyan: Honestly... Just the fact that you're willin' to give it a try means a lot to me.
Xinyan: After all, you're very special to me...
Xinyan: Hehe... I look forward to us doin' "rock 'n' roll" together!
Traveler: I'm afraid that I won't play very well...
Xinyan: Don't sweat it, you got me helpin' you!
Xinyan: I'll pay attention to every method and every step... Although this is my first time actin' as a teacher.
Traveler: Why would you ask me to play?
