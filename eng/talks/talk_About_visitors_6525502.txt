Traveler: About visitors...
Conjat: Hello, Honorary Senior Researcher. You mean, "What is there to even visit here"?
Conjat: Well, if we want to get specific about potential attractions... I guess it would be the airborne Central Laboratory.
Conjat: According to Messieurs Raimondo and Choiseul, the institute will convert that laboratory into a Safety Exhibition.
Conjat: Inside, there will be pictures from all the Institute's old research projects...
Conjat: Though... I don't see what those projects have to do with a Safety Exhibition...
Conjat: And would anyone want to visit such an exhibition...
