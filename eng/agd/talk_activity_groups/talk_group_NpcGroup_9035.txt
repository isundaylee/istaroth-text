## Talk

Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Qiqi: Umm... nice. Peaceful.
Qiqi: I can do my stretches in the daytime without anyone watching.
Qiqi: And there aren't too many things to... uhh... remember.
Traveler: Do you have your notebook with you?
Qiqi: Notebook? Notebook...
Qiqi: Notebook... Who is that again...?
Traveler: (Oh dear...)
Qiqi: No need. I will be fine...
Qiqi: Don't forget, Qiqi is stronger than she looks.
Traveler: Qiqi, do you still remember how to gather herbs?
Qiqi: Herbs...? Herbs...
Qiqi: ...Remind me, what are herbs again?
Traveler: I'll help you remember.

## Talk

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Qiqi: Chat... chat...
Qiqi: That would be nice. Chatting with you would be great.
Qiqi: ...But...
Traveler: But what?
Qiqi: ...I'll forget.
Qiqi: I'll forget everything we said...
Qiqi: ...I'll forget what your voice sounded like...
Qiqi: ...And... the happy feeling... I'll forget that too...
Traveler: But you will be happy in the moment, right? That's what's important.
Qiqi: Oh... really?
Qiqi: I suppose that... if I was sad now... you would be sad, too.
Qiqi: Okay. Qiqi wants to smile.
Traveler: Aww, what a cute smile.
Qiqi: Oh...
Qiqi: ...It's because you're here.
Traveler: I'll come and chat with you every day.
Qiqi: Every day...?
Qiqi: So, every day will be... happy?

## Talk

Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Qiqi: I... want to get a pet finch.
Qiqi: Then we can... look after it here... together.
Qiqi: If you find some seeds, I can feed it.
Qiqi: We can build a nest... so the wind and rain won't disturb it.
Qiqi: I will take it on walks during the daytime... and it can stretch with me before bedtime.
Traveler: You'd be like the finch's older sister.
Qiqi: Yes! I will be a good... role model.
Qiqi: I'll protect it... and you too.
Traveler: And I'll make sure to look after you both, too.
Qiqi: Mm-hmm!
Qiqi: You, Qiqi, and a nice little finch...
Qiqi: *sigh* That would be quite nice...
Traveler: Thanks, Qiqi, counting on you!
Traveler: It'd be sure to grow up strong and healthy.

## Talk

Qiqi: This place feels... familiar. Let me look at my notebook.
Qiqi: Yes, when I was gathering herbs, I rested somewhere. It was like this place.
Qiqi: So... this place is safe. Thank you.

## Talk

Qiqi: Hmm... My notebook doesn't say anything about this place.
Qiqi: But... it's very quiet. I like it. Can I come here often?
Qiqi: I wrote it in my notebook. Thank you.
