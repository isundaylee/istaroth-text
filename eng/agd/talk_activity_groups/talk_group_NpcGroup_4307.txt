Darina: Ah... It's been so long since I took in some fresh and clean air...

## Talk

Traveler: Hello.
Darina: Hello, the environment here is pretty great, right?
Darina: Many may say that the air here is too humid, but it's perfect for me.
Darina: You must understand that traveling through the desert is torture. If it wasn't for business, would anyone want to land a foot on that Archon-forsaken place?

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Darina: Goodbye, I'll be staying here for a while longer...

## Talk

Traveler: About the desert...
Darina: I'm sure you can imagine it without my help. An endless expanse of sand, the scorching sun, wind mixed with dirt...
Darina: Not to mention the dangers that the sandstorms pose, and the ruins filled with strange mechanisms.
Darina: According to some legends, there used to be no desert in Sumeru, and it was the battle between King Deshret and the Greater Lord that created the desert...
Darina: Oh, but I don't really care how the desert was formed. I'm more interested in when it'll go away.
Darina: That's when we Traveling Merchants will be able to do business more safely, after all.

Darina: I'm sure you can imagine it without my help. An endless expanse of sand, the scorching sun, wind mixed with dirt...
Darina: Not to mention the dangers posed by sandstorms, alongside ruins filled with strange mechanisms.
Darina: Some say that in the past, there weren't any deserts in Sumeru. The desert only appeared due to a battle between King Deshret and the Dendro Archon...
Darina: But every time I bring this up, someone will rebut me, saying that they never fought.
Darina: Not that I really care how the desert was formed, really. I'm more interested in when it'll go away.
Darina: That's when we traveling merchants will be able to do business more safely, you know?

Traveler: Adventure Challenge

## Talk

Darina: Alas... How could this be? No one has ever passed this challenge before...

## Talk

Darina: We traveling merchants often play cards in private, so you shouldn't be surprised by the difficulty of this challenge...

## Talk

Traveler: Big dream...
Darina: I haven't been able to dream ever since I grew up, but still, one should dream big.
Darina: Good luck will follow only if you dream big!
Darina: Maybe one day, King Deshret or Greater Lord Rukkhadevata will come back again...
Darina: Either will do. Upon their return, there will be no desert, no pain, no Samiel-Control Engineers, no Bimarstan's doctors.
Darina: Hehehe, just saying this cracks me up.
