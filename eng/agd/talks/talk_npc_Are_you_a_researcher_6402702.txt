# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Are you a researcher?
Jafar: I am, unfortunately.
Jafar: What is fortunate, however, is that I understand one thing better than the rest of my colleagues â€” research isn't the end-all and be-all of life.
Jafar: If you slog away at work all day, you'll get left behind in life, no matter how brilliant your research is.
Jafar: So, you've got to engage more with the people around you. Some drinking and chatting is the way to keep well, physically and mentally.
Jafar: Even if the price you pay is doing twice the work in the evenings. But you see, students are always coming to the office during the day to ask this and that, so I might as well do my research at night to get some peace and quiet.
