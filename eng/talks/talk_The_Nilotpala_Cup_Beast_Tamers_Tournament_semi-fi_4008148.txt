Message Board: "The competition has been going on for a little while. I'm just curious, how do each of the competitors train their Fungi?"
Message Board: "Everyone's Fungi started out the same, but they seem to be completely different in battle. It must be because of their training!"
Message Board: "I think that the organizers should allow the audience to look around the training facilities too. I want to get to know each contestant's style and how they spend each day with their Fungi."
Message Board: (There seem to be responses to this particular comment...)
Message Board: "Bro, don't be stupid! The training grounds are extremely dangerous! It's nothing like the arena!"
Message Board: "Besides, the competitors will definitely show us their best during their matches. There's no need for us to know everything they do. That'll only make things more difficult for them."

Message Board: "We will be organizing regular events to watch the competition at Baron Bigfoot's place. Anyone who's interested, please leave us a comment."
Message Board: "He is not charging any fees and will provide food and beverages! However, he won't be able to manage it all on his own, so it'd be great if everyone could bring some too!"
