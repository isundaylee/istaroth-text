Traveler: Aradasha's story.
Arakarman: Oh! Oooh! Arakarman likes Aradasha's story the most! Many Aranara like it too.
Arakarman: Before Aradasha, only the Lord of Verdure's Ararakalari was stronger than his. After Aradasha, Aradasha's Ararakalari was the strongest.
Arakarman: But Aradasha was not powerful from the time he was a seed.
Arakarman: Aradasha cultivated slowly, starting from destroying mushrooms, all the way to shattering Big Iron Chunks. He defeated eighteen bad guys in total.
Arakarman: And every time he defeated a bad guy, there would be another story, so Aradasha's stories are the most numerous.
Arakarman: Even weak Arakarman wants to cultivate Ararakalari after hearing these stories of training.
Arakarman: Later, Aradasha joined Aramuhukunda's adventure, and had the story that all Aranara know. In the blink of an eye, the big metal monsters were dealt with.
Arakarman: But soon after, the birds and the flying flowers could find no trace of him. He must have gone with Aramuhukunda, to a place far, far away.
Arakarman: *sigh* I wish I could see Aradasha's Ararakalari again.
