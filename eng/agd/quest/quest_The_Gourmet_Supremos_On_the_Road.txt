# The Gourmet Supremos: On the Road


## Talk 1

Xudong: Hey traveler! This way! I've been looking for you.
Traveler: That's right you are...
Xudong: We're the Gourmet Supremos. All-Star Gourmet!
Parvaneh: As I said, who would remember such a silly name...
Julie: Really? I think it's quite memorable...
Parvaneh: That's just because Xudong talks about it every day.
Xudong: Hahaha, a good name is not easy to come by. Of course I have to keep repeating it.
Traveler: What other names did you have before?
Julie: I came up with a lot of names, like "pika pika rice team" and "Gulu Gulu dessert team"!
Parvaneh: I really don't understand why you Mondstadters like to make these ridiculous names, sweetee floweree, Calla Lilyyy, Wolfhook fruitee...
Julie: You can also call me Julie-Julie...
Parvaneh: ...Julie, can you please act normal?
Xudong: Because these kinds of names are memorable. See, you remember it right away.
Parvaneh: Haha... So Liyue's Jueyun Chilili must've been named by a Mondstadter, right?
Xudong: No, that's totally different. This is simply to highlight the spiciness of the Jueyun Chilili. That's why we use the double "li". It makes perfect sense.
Parvaneh: That makes no sense! How does that highlight the spiciness of the Jueyun Chili?!
Julie: Well... I think it sounds cute...
Xudong: Hahaha, anyway, if it's memorable, it is a good name.
Xudong: All right, let's not talk about that. Traveler, we'd like to ask you a favor.
Xudong: We want to cook something special with the local ingredients of Inazuma.
Xudong: In order to ensure the freshness of the food, we are going to collect the ingredients in the forest north of the city.
Xudong: But... I heard there are many monsters over there, so I'd like to invite you to come with us. Other than the reward, we'll take care of your meals. What do you say? Would you like to help?
Traveler: What kind of ingredients do you want to collect?
Xudong: Let's decide when we get there. Making food with unknown ingredients is the principle of Gourmet Supremos.
Parvaneh: To put it bluntly, this guy never thinks about what kind of food he's going to make, or what kind of ingredients he's looking for. He just goes with the flow.
Xudong: Hahaha, you're not wrong. But no matter what the ingredients are, I'll be able to cook something delicious.
Xudong: Thank you, Traveler.
Traveler: Isn't Julie an adventurer?
Julie: Me? I can deal with the monsters, but when I do that, sometimes I get so focused that I get into all kinds of trouble.
Parvaneh: Meaning that when she's dealing with the monsters, she won't be able to deal with anything else except the monsters, until they drop dead.
Parvaneh: Then this idiot would chase the monsters and follow them to all sorts of weird places. And when she kills them, she'll completely forget where she is and get lost in the end.
Xudong: Her extreme focus is what makes Julie a great adventurer. But when she gets lost, it takes a long time to find her...
Julie: Well, there's a reason for it...
Parvaneh: Therefore, we'd like to ask you, a more self-restrained traveler, to help us deal with those monsters.
Xudong: That's right. We'll be counting on you, Traveler.
Traveler: The All-Star... something?

## Talk 2

???: What can I do for you?
Traveler: Excuse me, you are...
??? (Kamei Munehisa): I'm Kamei Munehisa, I am just passing by.
Julie: Wow... This guy dresses like a samurai...
Parvaneh: S...samurai? Is he the samurai from the Shogunate... I heard that the Shogunate's attitude towards outlanders is quite... subtle...
??? (Kamei Munehisa): ...
??? (Kamei Munehisa): Don't worry. I've left the Shogunate. I'm no longer a samurai.
??? (Kamei Munehisa): I often come here to look for food. But today, I noticed monsters wandering around.
??? (Kamei Munehisa): They've taken all the food around here. So I had to destroy them.
Traveler: How often do you come here?
??? (Kamei Munehisa): There are not many monsters around here usually. I often come here to pick fruits or hunt.
??? (Kamei Munehisa): Well, that's all I have to say. After killing these monsters, the other ones around here won't dare to come here for a while.
??? (Kamei Munehisa): If you are also looking for food, you can look around. I only took what I need. There should be something left.
??? (Kamei Munehisa): Well, goodbye.
Julie: Did he just leave just like that? His behavior is exactly like the samurai I heard about before...
Parvaneh: But what does he mean he's left the Shogunate? Samurai who have left the Shogunate are...
Traveler: They are like the enemies we met before.
Parvaneh: Yes, I also heard that some samurai who have left the Shogunate wander around and rob people in the streets for a living...
Parvaneh: Although he doesn't look like a bad guy, we'd better stay vigilant.
Xudong: All right, all right. Aren't we here to look for ingredients? But judging from the current situation, we'd better not go any further, in case it gets dangerous.
Xudong: This traveler has been escorting us for such a long time. Let's cook something here, have a short break and then we'll head back to town.
Xudong: The guy said there are still ingredients left behind, right? Let's look around.
Traveler: Like the Kairagi.
Traveler: Did you kill all these monsters?
??? (Kamei Munehisa): Yes, they are just ordinary monsters. They're easy to deal with.
Traveler: Why are you looking for food in the wild?
??? (Kamei Munehisa): ...
??? (Kamei Munehisa): I have my own reasons.

## Talk 3

Xudong: I was going to look for some fresh ingredients... Anyway, these will do.
Xudong: I'm sorry. I wanted to cook something nice for you, but now I guess we'll have to make do with these.
Traveler: It's fine.
Xudong: You worked hard escorting us. "It's fine" is not an acceptable answer.
Xudong: I'll remember this and treat you to a nice meal next time.
Xudong: Julie, is the soup ready? Remember not to let Parvaneh...
Julie: No, no, just let the soup simmer quietly!
Parvaneh: It's fine. I'm seasoning this soup according to my improved recipe. I'm just adding a little bit of seasoning...
Julie: I don't understand your improved recipe. Stop it! Xudong, Xudong, come over here!
Xudong: Parvaneh! Hey! What kind of strange seasoning are you putting in!?
Parvaneh: Strange seasoning? This is my special sauce! This is the result of my thesis research!
Xudong: I don't need that! Let's just eat something ordinary today! Julie, stop her!
Parvaneh: Humph, what do you know... Fine, let me fine-tune this. I am going to make the ultimate seasoning that will make any dish delicious.
Xudong: Ultimate seasoning... Is something like that really possible?
Parvaneh: No one has ever done it, that's why I am going to! I'll show those stuck-up unbelievers at the Akademiya!
Xudong: Haha... Well, I look forward to it.
Xudong: By the way, traveler, thank you for spending all this time running around with us. Thank you.
Xudong: I'll prepare a takeaway for you. You've got to have enough food when you are adventuring out there.
Xudong: Next time we meet, I will treat you to a nice meal.
Traveler: I'll find you to cook me a feast next time.
Xudong: Hahaha, okay. I'll make a note of this. I'll make sure to treat you to something nice next time...
