# Danger Lurks Everywhere in Fontaine


## Talk 1

Guijarro: It can't be... It can't be...
Traveler: What are you doing?
Guijarro: Ah! No! I swear I didn't do anything, please don't hurt me!
Paimon: What are you talking about? Why would we want to hurt you?
Guijarro: I don't know! But I also don't know that you won't really hurt me!
Traveler: You're not making any sense...
Guijarro: Oh! ...I've got it! It must be because I discovered your secret, right?
Guijarro: I... I took the newspaper with your secret letter hidden inside it in the coffee shop?
Guijarro: Or because I accidentally discovered your passphrase? Wait a moment, could it be that the fish I ate last night...
Guijarro: I say, the reason that the fish had so few bones is because you already deboned that fish!
Guijarro: Yes, yes, you wish to use the difference in the number of bones in each fish to send a message... But I accidentally bought this one and brought it back home with me...
Paimon: What the heck is this girl talking about? Paimon can't make heads or tails of it...
Traveler: I won't hurt you.
Guijarro: Y—You really aren't out to hurt me?
Paimon: What's with you!? We've only just met you, why would we want to hurt you?
Guijarro: R—Really? I'm... I'm glad. And I'm really sorry, how embarrassing...
Guijarro: I've been working hard on a detective novel recently, but I still don't know what methodology the criminal should use to commit their crime!
Guijarro: And because I am always overthinking things, so... Now when I look at anything, my first reaction is to consider how it could be used to... you know, commit crimes.
Guijarro: *sigh* That's why I was... so nervous just now. I truly am sorry. Maybe I have become what they call "paranoid" now.
Guijarro: I was about to ride the aquabus into the city for a cup of coffee, but when I saw aquabus running...
Guijarro: I... I immediately saw countless possibilities, all the ways I could be killed on an aquabus! I simply didn't dare to board.
Traveler: You said yourself it was only paranoia.
Guijarro: That may be so. But I simply cannot stop thinking about it, and the more I think, the more afraid I become...
Traveler: I'll accompany you...
Guijarro: Really!? Amazing, but... What if the people who want to hurt me hurt you too?
Traveler: You just try to relax...
Paimon: #Come on, come on! Stop overthinking it. No matter what the problem is, {NICKNAME} can handle it, easy peasy!
Traveler: I'll escort you there.
Traveler: There's no way that'd happen, stop overthinking it.
Traveler: Don't be so paranoid.
Traveler: What are you talking about?

## Talk 2

Guijarro: Ah, right... That's true...
Traveler: Coffee's getting cold.
Traveler: We're already finished drinking.
Guijarro: #Well, thank you, {NICKNAME}. And thank you for escorting me here.
Paimon: You say "escort," but all we did was walk with you here. We didn't do anything!
Traveler: Nothing bad happened.
Traveler: And you encountered no danger.
Guijarro: Yes. It appears I really was overthinking it...
Guijarro: This coffee is really great, haha... ha...
Guijarro: ...So, do you think it's poisoned?
Traveler: ...*psfffsh*
Traveler: Would it kill you not to say things like that for two seconds!?
Paimon: Stop saying that kind of baloney! We finished drinking already, and we're fine, right?
Guijarro: No, no, no, perhaps it is a... special sort of poisoning.
Guijarro: First, the poisoner mixes a kind of medicine into our coffee.
Guijarro: Drinking that medicine alone will have no effect whatsoever on the victim.
Guijarro: After we have finished our poisoned drinks and gone home, the poisoner will follow us...
Guijarro: And as we sleep, he will enter our room, and mix a second kind of medicine into your water bottle.
Guijarro: The next day, after you're out and about, you'll take a drink from your water bottle. Then, the two medicines will mix and react within your body.
Guijarro: And then we'll...
Black Screen Text: The sound of hurried footsteps suddenly draws near...
Arouet: My dear customer, just what are you saying?
Arouet: Coffee? Poisoned? Please do not make such jests in my establishment!
Arouet: Should your japes affect the other customers, I shall have to ask you to leave!
Black Screen Text: Guijarro apologizes to Arouet in a panic, and explains her situation.
Black Screen Text: By way of apology, Guijarro buys another three cups of coffee...
Paimon: You watched him make the coffee this time! There's no way there could be a problem with it.
Traveler: Stop imagining things.
Guijarro: I know, I know, but... I did find a lot of inspiration along the way.
Guijarro: If I just put it all together, I'm sure I can think of how the perfect crime — one that leaves no trace — could be committed!
Guijarro: After I finish writing the book, I'll be sure to send you a copy.
Guijarro: But before that, let me finish this cup of coffee, this cup... of coffee...
Guijarro: #Uh, {NICKNAME}, do you think... Is it at all possible...
Traveler: Shut it!
Traveler: Just stop right there!
Guijarro: Could this cup itself have poison on it!?

Arouet: Should your japes affect the other customers, I shall have to ask you to leave!
Traveler: Sir, allow me to explain...
Traveler: She's a friend of mine.
Black Screen Text: You explain Guijarro's situation to Arouet. After listening, he leaves, exasperated...
Black Screen Text: By way of apology, Guijarro buys another three cups of coffee...
Paimon: You watched him make the coffee this time! There's no way there could be a problem with it.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Hey! Slow down, aren't you worried someone'll toss a rock and trip you up or something?

## Talk 5

Paimon: Why are you hiding again? There's nothing around here!
Guijarro: Can't you see that Gardemek? It's right in front of us!
Traveler: Is something wrong with it?
Guijarro: Shh! Quick, get out of there! What if it goes out of control?
Guijarro: Or maybe its... its power core will suddenly explode! Or someone controlling it remotely will use it to attack us?
Traveler: It looks completely normal to me.
Guijarro: That is exactly what makes me so scared! A meka that is operating normally suddenly losing control, and some poor unfortunate sop suddenly losing their life...
Guijarro: Nobody would even be held responsible for such a thing! Perhaps the true culprit would never be found... No, it's simply too dangerous!
Paimon: It already left, you can come out now!
Guijarro: Phew... It didn't go out of control, truly unexpected. Our lives have been spared yet again.
Traveler: That kind of accident just isn't possible.
Guijarro: What I was thinking of, was more of an "intentional accident."
Guijarro: Wait. But criminal events without a culprit... A crime that no individual will be held solely responsible for...
Guijarro: That's it! Inspiration has struck! Quickly, quickly, to the café! I must write this down!
Paimon: Hey! Slow down, aren't you worried someone'll toss a rock and trip you or something?
Traveler: It wasn't going to go berserk in the first place, capeesh?
Traveler: Uh... and?

## Talk 6

Paimon: ...Hey! Why are you crouching on the ground holding your head?
Paimon: Did you hit your head or something? But there isn't anything here to hit your head on...
Guijarro: Shh! Get over here! Lie down next to me! It's dangerous here...
Paimon: Here we go again...
Guijarro: This aquabus doesn't have any kind of barrier on top! If you place two poles on either side, and run fishing line between them...
Guijarro: Then when the aquabus passes through, that fishing line will suddenly become a knife that...
Paimon: Aaaah! Stop! Don't say any more!
Guijarro: No, no, you don't even need two poles! One would be enough...
Guijarro: And if you hung up some fishing line on it, with the hook just dangling there...
Guijarro: Then the people on the aquabus would naturally be hooked, and left hanging in the air, and then...
Paimon: Not listening not listening not listening... Paimon's not listening, lalalala!
Paimon: After listening to her this whole time, even Paimon's getting kinda scared...
Paimon: Let's get off the aquabus as soon as we arrive at the station, alright?
