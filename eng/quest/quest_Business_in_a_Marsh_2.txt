# Business in a Marsh


## Talk 1

Huai'an: *sigh* Whatever am I going to do...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Huai'an: This location... It's a real challenge to run an inn here.
Huai'an: Dihua Marsh means lots of Silvergrass, and where treasure lies, monsters will follow.
Huai'an: We're lucky that the Millelith cleared most of them out of the area. Since then it's mostly been fine.
Huai'an: But inexplicably, they seem to have made something of a resurgence recently.
Huai'an: I know they would never come anywhere near the inn, but there's no denying they're an eyesore. And if even I think so, I can guarantee my customers will too.
Huai'an: Are you free to help? It would be great if you could deal with any nearby monsters for me.
Traveler: Okay.
Huai'an: Haha... Ah, I must say I do find your forthrightness refreshing...
Huai'an: Anyway. I'm not exactly thrilled to be begging a guest for help like this.
Huai'an: But please be assured that you will be well compensated for your trouble.
Huai'an: Best of luck, and thank you.
Traveler: You're stressing out over an eyesore!?
Huai'an: Frankly, yes, their irksome presence is the biggest problem they pose.
Huai'an: But some people, such as a certain young gentleman obsessed with peace and quiet, find that simply intolerable. And when something upsets him, it usually ends up upsetting the rest of Dihua Marsh too...

## Talk 2

Huai'an: How's it coming along? All clear?
Traveler: Not yet.
Huai'an: Alright, well there's no rush. They tend to keep their distance so they don't pose a huge threat.
Huai'an: But if one of the blind ones happened to lose its way and end up disrupting that young gentleman's peace and quiet...
Huai'an: It might well plunge all of Dihua Marsh into a mad panic. More to the point, the inn would see no business until things finally quietened down.

## Talk 3

Huai'an: How's it coming along? All clear?
Traveler: All clear.
Huai'an: Great. Thanks a lot.
Huai'an: As promised, here's your payment.
Huai'an: Fingers crossed we're in the clear for a while now...
Huai'an: Pardon? Who's the young gentleman? ...That's a question for the boss.
