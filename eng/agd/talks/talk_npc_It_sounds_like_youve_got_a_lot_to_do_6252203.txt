Traveler: It sounds like you've got a lot to do...
Zhigui: It can't be helped. After all, Yilong Wharf is a busy port with people coming and going all the time. Without someone in charge of coordinating all this activity, everything becomes a big mess in a big hurry.
Zhigui: Sometimes, I don't even have time to enjoy a nice pot of tea with Gaming when he comes back... He's also always busy as a bee, heh.
Zhigui: Good thing Gaming has made so many friends here, so he doesn't need the likes of me worrying about him.
