Traveler: Do you like taking photos?
Pele Nui: I like it a lot! Compared to scenery, though, I prefer taking pictures of people.
Pele Nui: I've shot a lot of family photos, enough to make several big albums. Out of my family members, my niece Haloa humors me the most — you can see her in nearly all the photos.
Pele Nui: Oh, and I also like getting pictures with famous people. I've asked for a picture with every hero and warrior who's come here for a dip.

Traveler: Then you must know Atea, then?
Pele Nui: Atea... Ah, if I'm not mistaken, you must be Mualani's friend, right?
Pele Nui: Atea's mentioned you to me before. Thank you so much for helping everyone at our tribe.
Pele Nui: Ah, Atea... She said that she knew her day would come. She even told us to not be too sad on her behalf...
Pele Nui: Speaking of Atea, I once took a picture of her with our Archon! They looked super cool together.
Pele Nui: I don't have it on me, though, so I guess I should go dig it out and show it to everyone.
