Traveler: Wait, have you heard anything about me?
Lasselin: Oh, there have been plenty of stories about you â€” your adventures, the enemies you've defeated, the treasures you've obtained, and the titles you've earned.
Lasselin: Heck if I know how true they are. Perhaps they're nothing more than drunken ramblings.
Lasselin: However, if you're interested in these rumors, or if you want to hear some... other stories from me...
Lasselin: Well... you know.
