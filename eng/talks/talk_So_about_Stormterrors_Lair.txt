Traveler: So, about Stormterror's Lair...
Cyrus: Ah, the Windblume Festival has its origins in Old Mondstadt and the days of the Lord of the Tower. Nowadays, no one knows what the Windblume truly is.
Cyrus: And that is why we explore ancient ruins to uncover the history of resistance in those days. We wish to uncover the truth behind the Windblume.
Cyrus: It is a shame that few young people agree with our views...
Cyrus: If you ask me, the Windblume Festival should be about recounting the era of the Tower of Storms, and the legend of that heroic rebellion, haha!
