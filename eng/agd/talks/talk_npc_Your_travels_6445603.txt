Traveler: Your travels...
Augustus Lovelace: Nothing special, really. I could have come directly to Sumeru from Fontaine... after all, there's a line going straight to the Bayda Harbor in Sumeru.
Augustus Lovelace: But to make the trip a bit more interesting, I went to Liyue via Lumidouce Harbor and Chenyu Vale.
Augustus Lovelace: After that, I took a ferry to Port Ormos from Liyue Harbor. Then I traveled northwards along the river, and here I am.
Augustus Lovelace: When I return, I may trek across the desert, and return via Romaritime Harbor.
Augustus Lovelace: ...However, I have plenty of Mora left, so crossing the desert to Natlan sounds nice, too...
