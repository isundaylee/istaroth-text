### Additional Talk 1

Katarina: What? Are you here to disturb my rest?
Paimon: Nope, we just wanna talk to you, seeing you sitting here all by your lonesome.
Traveler: It must be quite boring to drink alone.
Katarina: Is that so? Thank you. You... remind me of Lyudochka.
Katarina: She's really enthusiastic, just like you... She kept sticking with me, telling me all sorts of things... I was the only one she often confided certain things to.
Katarina: *sigh* How I wish she was around. She's such a fun person. I bet you'd like her if you saw her.
Traveler: Lyudochka? Who is she?
Katarina: A friend of mine. Though she may appear serious, she's a funny little pumpkin.
Katarina: We were like sisters back in the House of the Hearth — I'd say that she was even dearer than a real sister. She liked to tease me... And she also looked after me.
Katarina: Haha, anyway, I have a hunch that she's doing fine out there. With this thought in mind, all the injuries that I got in this hell of a place seem to feel like nothing.
Katarina: I hope she's doing her job alright... Hope she doesn't think of me.
Traveler: Lyudochka... You mean the one in Inazuma...
Katarina: ...
Katarina: So, her cover was blown...
Paimon: Eh, how did you know?
Traveler: She... managed to escape.
Katarina: Really?
Katarina: Haha... That's a relief to know. Let's hope she's still doing her job well.
Katarina: But if she betrays the Tsaritsa for fear of death...
Katarina: ...I hope she doesn't think of me.
Traveler: She's still alive, and she's doing great.
Traveler: So we came over for a chat.
