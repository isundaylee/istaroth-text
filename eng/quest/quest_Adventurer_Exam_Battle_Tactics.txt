# Adventurer Exam: Battle Tactics


## Talk 1

Anthony: Anna, please reconsider. We should really take the long-term view here...
Anna: Oh, come on! Stop worrying, already. I'll be fine!
Traveler: Doing well over there, Anna?
Anthony: Traveler! You're just in time! Please, you've got to help me out here. Anna wants to become an adventurer!
Anna: And why can't I be an adventurer? I'm as healthy as can be, and Cyrus says I've got the mind for the job, too!
Anthony: You haven't even been well for that long! What are you going to do if you fall ill again? Besides, there's no way our parents will agree!
Anna: Come on, I've already talked to Mom and Dad about this. They say they'll allow it as long as I pass the Adventurers' Guild selection trials.
Anthony: Wh... What!?
Traveler: Calm down, son...
Anna: Cyrus helped me get a training schedule set up a few days back. I've been training ever since then.
Anna: That said, it's all been scouting work, foraging for emergency rations, outdoor survival, and stuff like that...
Anna: But I've heard that adventurers also do battle with monsters out in the wild often, too.
Anna: I'd love to learn how to do that, but I haven't found anyone who'll teach me...
Anna: And as you can see, my brother...
Anthony: I won't have it! Those monsters are highly dangerous! Even if you do go, you'll have to make sure you're accompanied by a seasoned veteran at the very least!
Anna: I mean, I've asked Jack! He agreed to help me.
Anthony: Oh, get real. I know who Jack is. He can barely take care of himself out there, let alone you.
Anna: Well, I doubt we'll find any veteran adventurers that easily at the Guild, and I don't have the funds to put a commission up...
Traveler: Hmm. Why don't I come with you?
Anna: Eh? You'd help me out! That's great!
Anna: Alright then, brother, guess you can rest easy now!
Anthony: Well...
Anthony: #*sigh* Alright, alright. I know how strong the Honorary Knight is. With {F#her}{M#him} by your side, I suppose I can rest a little easier.
Anthony: However, you should still be careful out there...
Anthony: Do you remember everything I told you?
Anna: Yeah, yeah, I remember them... You've talked my ear off several times already!
Anna: Alright then, Traveler, let's head out right now! I've had Jack check out the encampment we're going to.
Traveler: I've got some confidence in my skills.
Traveler: In that case, how's your training going?
Traveler: What are you two talking about, Anthony?

## Talk 2

Anna: Wow, you beat them all down — you made it look pretty easy, too.
Anna: It's just as the handbook says — you can use all sorts of ways and means to beat monsters...
Anna: Still, I've got to admit that they still scare me when they're this close. It's a good thing we've got you around...
Traveler: You still need more training.
Anna: Yup, I know. The road to becoming an adventurer is far from easy.
Anna: Thank you, Traveler! I'll head back to the city now. I'm sure my brother's worried sick by now...
Anna: I've got to train harder from now on.

## Talk 3

Anna: Wow, you beat them all down — you made it look pretty easy, too.
Anna: You just went at them head-on... It's nice to be strong, huh?
Anna: Still, I've got to admit that they still scare me when they're this close. It's a good thing we've got you around...
Traveler: You still need more training.
Anna: Yup, I know. The road to becoming an adventurer is far from easy.
Anna: Thank you, Traveler! I'll head back to the city now. I'm sure my brother's worried sick by now...
Anna: I've got to train harder from now on.

Anthony: I'm leaving Anna in your care, Traveler. Please make sure that she doesn't come to any harm.
Anthony: *sigh* She's only been well for a short while, and she's already causing havoc...
