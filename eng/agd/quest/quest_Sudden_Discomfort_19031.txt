# Sudden Discomfort


## Talk 1

Chongyun: Sorry for troubling you again...
Chongyun: Just be careful while collecting the ingredients...

## Talk 2

Fu San'er: It's dangerous to walk alone here, isn't it?
Fu San'er: You have no idea who... or what you'll meet.
Traveler: ...
Fu San'er: Hmm, you seem to be pretty calm. You know, there's a saying, "you can't keep your shoes dry if you keep walking along the river."
Fu San'er: You're bound to run into something in such a strange and eerie place...
Fu San'er: And what you encounter here could become a nightmare that haunts you for the rest of your life.
Traveler: Oh, really?
Fu San'er: Huh? How are you so calm? People usually run away in terror before I can even finish a sentence.
Traveler: You look like just another average person to me.
Fu San'er: Yeah... but a more sophisticated way to play a ghost is to create a creepy atmosphere that scares people psychologically.
Fu San'er: In which case, my appearance becomes irrelevant.
Fu San'er: *sigh* Besides, I'll never be able to scare someone like you who doesn't believe in ghosts to begin with.
Traveler: Sounds like you're just slacking off to me...
Fu San'er: Hey, that's not true! Oh, I'd better go find some wimps to scare now!
Fu San'er: You should go back and find your partner. He might be terrified by now.
Traveler: Don't you have a costume or anything like that?
Fu San'er: Yes, I have one, but it's too hot to wear... and besides, a more sophisticated way to play a ghost is to create a creepy atmosphere that scares people psychologically.
Fu San'er: In which case, my appearance becomes irrelevant.
Traveler: Sorry, I don't get it... What are you doing here?
Traveler: Hello.
