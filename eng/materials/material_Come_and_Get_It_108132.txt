# Come and Get It

A dish made out of a luxurious variety of ingredients. There is no great refinement in the making of this food, and it appears in Liyue often during festival season. Whenever this dish is served up, the person at the head of the table will invite everyone to dig in, saying "Come on, eat, eat," hence the name.
