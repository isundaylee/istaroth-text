# In the City of Geo Live the Adepti


## Talk 1

Jiayi: Erm... Ah yes, you two were here yesterday to report some suspicious activity.
Jiayi: I... *sigh* I won't lie to you, the Ministry of Civil Affairs is unbelievably busy during Lantern Rite. We simply don't have the staff to cover this case at the moment.
Paimon: What? Are you kidding me!?
Jiayi: I do hate to let you down like this, and I appreciate that you took the trouble to report this out of the goodness of your hearts. Hmm, I wonder if...
Jiayi: I do believe we have one smaller squad that just might be able to help. They only have one assignment left today.
Jiayi: They are currently subduing the monster presence at the Guili Plains. If you are able to make contact with them...

## Talk 2

Xinghuo: The monster presence has been duly investigated. Dismissed! ...Huh?
Xinghuo: Who are you with?
Paimon: Jiayi sent us to find you, he said...
Xinghuo: I see. I understand.
Xinghuo: The Ministry of Civil Affairs is grateful for your support. Your case is well noted and will be scheduled for investigation as soon as possible.
Xinghuo: May our paths cross again in Liyue, kind travelers.
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon is starting to feel like...
Traveler: The ministry isn't taking this seriously.
Paimon: Exactly! Paimon thinks so too!
Paimon: The locals must take all their tasty treats for granted by now.
Paimon: But for a poor traveler, all alone out in the wilderness, often forced to survive on nothing but the most mysterious of mushrooms...
Paimon: For you, the Lantern Rite is the most important of all festivals!
Paimon: So let's go back to the place where we witnessed the shady-looking guy.
Paimon: Paimon hears from patrol officers that criminals love to go back for another look at the crime scene after the event. Eh, it's a psychological thing, apparently.
Traveler: But the crime hasn't even happened yet...
Paimon: That's why there's no time to lose! When there's highly flammable materials involved, once the crime happens it'll be too late!
Traveler: We should take this into our own hands.
Paimon: Paimon thinks so too!
Paimon: With our wealth of experience adventuring far and wide, we should be able to get to the bottom of this.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Aha! Knew it!
Traveler: Should we chase after him?
Paimon: Wait, there's another person—
Traveler: We should chase after him.

## Talk 4

Paimon: ...
Xiao: ...
Paimon: #Hey {NICKNAME}, Paimon reckons this guy is gonna make a difficult conversation partner...
Paimon: If Paimon was gonna hazard a guess, Paimon would say he's definitely not one of the good guys!
Xiao: Your hazardous guesswork is a woefully insufficient means of judging between good and evil.
Xiao: Nevertheless, you surmise correctly. I am a malevolent spirit. A guardian yaksha, slaughterer of monsters and vanquisher of demons - Xiao.
Traveler: I'm sure I heard that term the other day.
Traveler: Paimon, do you know what a yaksha is?
Paimon: Guardian Yaksha!
Paimon: Yes... Someone from Liyue was telling us that yakshas are also a kind of adeptus. Supernatural beings that protect Liyue.
Paimon: They stand guard over the human world in secret, protecting it from monsters and demons. But most people don't even know they exist.
Paimon: ...Wait, doesn't that make you the good guys by most definitions?
Xiao: ...No. Do not mistake the yakshas' guardianship for some sort of good will towards humanity.
Paimon: Hmph, charming! There's a whole city of humans out there working hard to prepare for Lantern Rite, all for the sake of honoring the heroes of Liyue's history...
Paimon: ...Turns out we have here an actual historical hero, who has miraculously survived through to this day... and yet, he doesn't even appreciate the gesture!
Xiao: ...
Paimon: So, Mr. Xiao... Uh, that is, assuming "Mr." is the correct way to address an adeptus... Why didn't you stop that shady character earlier?
Xiao: I sensed a malign influence here. I'm here to investigate.
Xiao: When a shackle is loosened in the realms of deities and demons, I take full responsibility.
Xiao: But this time, the threat comes from the mortal world — your world. Thus you shall take full responsibility, mortal traveler.
Xiao: When the time comes, I hope you shall act promptly and decisively...
Xiao: I do not wish for the tassel of the polearm that has slaughtered countless demons to become stained with mortal blood.
Paimon: What's this?
Traveler: Paimon, do you recognize it?
Xiao: A symbol that your suspected evildoer left behind.
Paimon: Doesn't look familiar to Paimon.
Xiao: Well, you will have to show me how much you can accomplish on your own strength.
Traveler: Actually, quite a festive color in this part of the world...
Xiao: Because if I become involved, there is a possibility that the streets of Liyue Harbor will be painted red this Lantern Rite.
Paimon: That sounds terrible!
Paimon: Ahh, let's not be impulsive. Why don't we figure out the origins of this symbol first?
