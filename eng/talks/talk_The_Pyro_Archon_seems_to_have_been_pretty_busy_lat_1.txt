Coyopa: The Pyro Archon seems to have been pretty busy lately. The Masters of the Night-Wind haven't made any big announcements, have they?
Coa: No news on my end.
Coa: Come to think of it though, the Pyro Archon seems to have got everyone searching for a Fatui Harbinger, and there's talk that someone from the Masters of the Night-Wind might be caught up in it all.
Coyopa: Oh? That doesn't sound too good...
Coa: *sigh* Things have been a bit too eventful recently for my liking too.
Coa: So... How about that drink?
