# Water Beneath the Lanterns Flows Deep


## Talk 1

Huixin: Oh, hello you two. Many thanks for your donation to Lantern Rite.
Huixin: Today, I have another matter to discuss with you. Not a donation this time; more of a sales and purchase situation. Interested?
Paimon: Sure beats working for free, like last time! Paimon's interested.
Huixin: Haha, wonderful! I appreciate the help. Now, let me explain the situation...
Huixin: I need two kinds of Plaustrite for official festival use.
Huixin: One is called Azurite. It is occasionally found in the northern part of Mt. Tianheng.
Huixin: When Azurite gets caught in the roots of ordinary vegetation, it sometimes produces Bloatty Floatties, which have floating seeds.
Huixin: The other one is called Vermillionite, which is extremely dangerous as far as most people are concerned...
Huixin: In Guili Plains, old Ruin Hunters who have lost the power of flight use Vermillionite to keep themselves airborne.
Paimon: Got it! So, Azurite and Vermillionite, right?
Huixin: (Actually, they're just blue and red varieties of Plaustrite... Gemstone merchants only gave them fancy names to try and impress their customers...)
Huixin: That's right. Please get some of each for me. Good luck!

## Talk 2

Huixin: Ooh... These are some fine pieces of Azurite and Vermillionite!
Huixin: My thanks to you both. Here's your payment.
Huixin: None of your efforts are wasted. Every piece adds that bit more luster and color to Lantern Rite.
Huixin: Since you're staying in Liyue during the festival, make sure to keep an eye on the Mingxiao Lantern.
Huixin: As the work progresses, the construction site at the harbor will become more and more magnificent to behold.
Paimon: #Sounds fascinating. Traveler, how about we take a look now?

## Talk 3

???: Hey, whatcha doin'?
???: Whatcha staring at me like that for? Get gone!
???: Wha— Huh?
???: ...Alright, if you all won't get gone, I'm just gonna get going myself I guess...
Paimon: Wow. Paimon thought he might be a shady character, then he opened his mouth and now Paimon's sure of it!
Paimon: He must have been up to something when he was crouching down on the ground. Because as soon as he saw us approaching, he stood up and acted all innocent...
Paimon: #Traveler, Paimon has a bad feeling about this...
Paimon: What could he be up to? Let's investigate!

## Talk 4

Paimon: On the final day of the Lantern Rite festival, huge crowds come out to watch the Mingxiao Lantern being released.
Paimon: It can't be a good sign if there's a suspicious character lurking around somewhere so dangerous.
Paimon: If he's been tampering with the stockpile of lantern supplies...
Paimon: This is a matter for the authorities! Quick, let's go to the Liyue Ministry of Civil Affairs and report it at once!
Traveler: Paimon, you're taking this very seriously. Why?
Paimon: Because... Because... Everyone in Liyue has worked really hard for this! No-one should be allowed to spoil it, period!
Traveler: ...What's the real reason?
Paimon: Because... Near the harbor is that Zhongyuan Chop Suey place! Take one bite, hooked for life! The original and best!
Traveler: Clearly their marketing campaigns have been effective.
Paimon: Ehehehe...

## Talk 5

Jiayi: Hold up! This is the Liyue Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Traveler: We are here to report some suspicious activity.
Paimon: Yeah, we saw a shady-looking guy snooping around near the stockpile of highly flammable Mingxiao Lantern supplies!
Paimon: We absolutely cannot let this be the end of Zhongyuan Chop Suey!
Jiayi: Hmm, goodness! This is a serious matter indeed.
Paimon: Exactly what Paimon thought! Liyue Harbor's cuisine is the heart and soul of the city—
Jiayi: ...It seems we disagree on where the seriousness of the matter lies. But you're not wrong, my little friend.
Jiayi: I have noted your concerns and will pass them on diligently to my superiors.
Jiayi: Thank you. You were right to report this.
Paimon: Make sure it's given top priority! It needs to be dealt with properly!
