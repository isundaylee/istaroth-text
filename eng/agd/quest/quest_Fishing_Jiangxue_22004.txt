# Fishing Jiangxue


## Talk 1

Jiangxue: I hope I catch something eventually...
Traveler: What are you doing?
Jiangxue: Preparing to reel in the biggest catch you've ever seen!
Jiangxue: I have a friend who enjoys cooking. If I catch a nice big fish for him, I bet it'll make him happy.
Jiangxue: The only thing is, monsters keep stirring up trouble here, which disturbs the fish.
Jiangxue: I sense strong elemental power in you. Would you be willing to deal with the monsters for me, so I can finally catch that fish?
Traveler: Okay.
Jiangxue: Thank you.
Paimon: But how do you know when the monsters will get here?
Jiangxue: Seeing is believing. Look out behind you.
Paimon: Hah! That's the oldest trick in the bookâ€”
Traveler: How can you tell?
Jiangxue: I once had a Vision, too. I don't bother using it anymore, but I can still sense elemental power when I want to.
Jiangxue: With the power of the elements on your side, these monsters should be a piece of cake for you.

## Talk 2

Paimon: You... you got them! But Paimon didn't see you lift a finger...
Paimon: Who ARE you?
Jiangxue: Just a fisherman.
Traveler: Hmm... This doesn't add up.
Jiangxue: You're right, it doesn't. Lots of things in this world don't add up.
Jiangxue: The chef from the inn, for example. He used to be a sword fighter, now he loves to cook. He's stony-faced but has a heart of gold.
Jiangxue: And the boss. She's a Mondstadter, but nobody from Mondstadt knows her.
Jiangxue: And... you. You don't have a Vision, yet you can still use elemental power.
Jiangxue: Some things don't add up, but that doesn't always mean they are to be feared.
Jiangxue: Take these as a token of my thanks. I want to carry on fishing now.
