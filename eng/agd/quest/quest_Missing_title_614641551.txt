Traveler: Tell me about this mountain...
Esther: Oh, interested in Dragonspine, are you? Interesting. You might have some potential as a geographer...
Esther: I became a researcher out of curiosity concerning the source of Springvale's spring water â€” that source turned out to be the melting snow of Dragonspine.
Esther: In order to study Dragonspine's environment more deeply, I prepared some Frostshield Potions, but it turns out the cold here is so intense that even potions are useless against it...
Esther: They serve no purpose with me, so I reckon that you should take them. They won't be enough to resist the cold here on Dragonspine, but they might be of use in your future adventures.
