## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Plauen: *sigh* Can the Guild really manage this amount of work...
Plauen: Ah, Traveler! My apologies for not noticing you sooner. I had some Guild affairs on my mind...
Plauen: You must be here in Mondstadt for the Windblume Festival, I presume?
Plauen: You're just in time: The Guild has just come up with a little game â€” a guaranteed romp with prizes to be won!
Plauen: How about it? Wanna give it a go?
Plauen: Let me introduce this little game to you first. The person who designed it calls it "Floral Chess."
Plauen: He said that his inspiration came from the billowing petals and the wind that pursues them...
Plauen: And the game is meant to imitate the... romanticism of pursuing these flower petals...
Traveler: That's, uh, quite the story...
Plauen: Well, this inventor is a bard, so he has more of... You know, an imagination.
Plauen: Basically, when you're playing this form of chess, you need to collect as many Bloom Balloons within the chessboard as possible.
Plauen: You'll have to avoid various obstacles in the process... and there'll be some tools on hand to lend you some support...
Plauen: That fellow even wrote an entire manual for this game, which I'll let you have a look at later.
Plauen: If you're interested, you're welcome to play. Remember, prizes are guaranteed just for participating!
Traveler: That's, ah, kinda complicated...
