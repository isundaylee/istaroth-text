# Quiet Elegance

Kamisato Ayato's specialty. The arrangement is exquisite and elegant, much like the manner in which Ayato handles all his affairs. Any more, and it would have been excessive. Any less, and it would have proved a sight squandered. As you sample the dish, you find that its flavor is identical to that of Uyuu Restaurant's â€” amazing. But as you reach your chopsticks for that crystalline camellia, Ayato stops you... "That was something I made during sword practice. It's just a decoration."
