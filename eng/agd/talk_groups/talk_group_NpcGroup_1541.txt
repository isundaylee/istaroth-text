Traveler: What are you doing?
Brook: If you want the absolutely freshest meat possible, it has to go straight from the hunt to the kitchen with not a moment wasted.
Brook: That's the reason I moved to Springvale.
Brook: Of course, I do sell the vast majority of my cooking...
Brook: But the single freshest piece of meat in the day? I normally keep it as a treat for myself.

Brook: Hey, aren't you the assistant for Xiangling, the chef from Liyue?
Brook: You couldn't possibly be here by coincidence. I've got it! She must want to challenge me again. I am "Mondstadt's Rotisseur Queen," after all.
