Traveler: May I ask about the Almighty Shogun?
Amano: The fame of the Almighty Shogun spreads afar throughout the world. She keeps the eternal peace in Inazuma.
Amano: About the Sakoku Decree though... No, never mind. I have no problem with that.
Amano: Of course it's better that we have fewer outlanders to deal with. For the lucky few such as yourself who have come to Inazuma, you must follow the rules here.
