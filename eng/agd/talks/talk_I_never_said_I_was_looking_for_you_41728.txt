Traveler: I never said I was looking for you...
Herman: Oh I see, I misunderstood. I thought you were another one of these who'd heard my story and came here to harass me about it.
Herman: Look, whatever stories you've heard about Herman the adventurer, don't believe a word! ...Even the ones that are true.
Herman: Because I'm not the same person anymore. No more starry-eyed "ad astra" adventurer for me; the only thing that catches my eye now is my wife. And no more conquering the abyss â€” not when I've got a daughter to deal with!
Herman: So long as they are in my life, I don't have the right to tempt fate by going on adventures anymore.
