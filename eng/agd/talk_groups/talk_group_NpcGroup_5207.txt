Traveler: What's your job?
Lanty: I am... Uh, I used to be a clerk in 5th Finances Office at the Fontaine Research Institute.
Lanty: I was at the Maison Gestion discussing the delivery of some reports when the institute blew up. So I was lucky enough to, you know... not get blown up...
Lanty: But our office and all our financial reports were blown to smithereens.
Lanty: I mean, it's not bad news. But it's not good news, either...

Traveler: See you.
Lanty: Goodbye. I need to keep working on the financial reports.

Traveler: Why isn't it bad news?
Lanty: Because... There used to be numerous projects running at the Fontaine Research Institute, and each one would always be applying to purchase this or that resource. The volume was simply enormous.
Lanty: In accordance with regulations, all purchases and expenses had to be recorded in detail in financial reports so we could carry out an end-of-year audit.
Lanty: But most of the researchers didn't care much about following proper procedures for applications or records. The info they submitted was always a mess, mistakes and missing items everywhere...
Lanty: The end-of-year audits never managed to completely settle all the accounts. And that meant we had to empty the filing cabinets in search of receipts and order forms... It was chaos.
Lanty: But the explosion destroyed all that paperwork. Which means this year I'll be able to relax for once...

Traveler: But you also said it's not good news?
Lanty: Because... Hahaha, I'm now the only accountant able to work!
Lanty: Rebuilding the Fontaine Research Institute is going to mean buying lots of materials. How am I meant to cope with all that accounting work on my own...
Lanty: Oh, I'll just have to pray the reconstruction work goes slowly. Or that I can find a competent assistant...
