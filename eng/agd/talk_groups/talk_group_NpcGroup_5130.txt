Traveler: Tell me about diving...
Archenoul: If people without Visions want to dive, they need to go through specialized training first, and they must be accompanied by a professional diver when they first go underwater.
Archenoul: The underwater world is very beautiful, but never underestimate its potential dangers.
Archenoul: For example, most people only pay attention to whether their diving equipment is intact and functional, but ignore their own physical condition.
Archenoul: If you do not warm up before a dive, or if you cannot adapt to the water pressure in time, you can get muscle cramps or symptoms such as tinnitus.

Traveler: For rebuilding Poisson, right?
Archenoul: Hmm... half-and-half.
Archenoul: It's partly to clear out the junk in the water and perform underwater reconstruction work. And partly to recover everyone's belongings.
Archenoul: Loads of valuables belonging to the citizens were washed away. It doesn't matter how much they're actually worth, but they all meant something.
Archenoul: I'd like to help recover them, if I can.
