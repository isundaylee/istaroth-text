Traveler: You really love this, huh?
Freycinet: Yeah. And for me, it's not just the balloon riding experience. Their operating principles are fascinating in their own right!
Freycinet: Based on my observations and experiences, despite the balloons being rather slow, they still have Fontainian aircraft beat both in terms of altitude control and navigation...
Freycinet: Oh, speaking of which! Because I've been helping residents with some reconstruction efforts, Mr. Pixica gave me priority access to hot-air balloon rides!
Freycinet: But my shooting skills are complete trash, so I'd better not bug him too often.
Freycinet: I'll go chat with him once I've taken down enough notes.
