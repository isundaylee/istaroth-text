Traveler: About 50 Things Every Traveling Scholar Should Know...
Banu: You mean the book I lent you? Don't worry about it, I've got a few more copies in my pack and a good pile at home.
Banu: They've printed too many copies, so the editor just gave the rest to us. After all, Shalmar wrote the book.
Banu: I've been preparing to become a traveling scholar, so I've read that book many times, to the point where I can recite most of it. So it's fine to lend it to others.
Banu: Although, the copy I lent to you only has a few pages left. Save for the map, I've used most of the pages to light fires...
Banu: If you want to give it a read, I can lend you an intact copy.
