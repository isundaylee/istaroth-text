Jiawei: Hmm. I made my wife some Squirrel Fish yesterday... How about some Black-Back Perch Stew today, then?

Traveler: Who are you?
Jiawei: Ah, how do you do? My name's Jiawei.
Jiawei: As you can see, I'm a fisherman... An elite one at that.
Jiawei: I know I just look like some guy staring out into space here at the harbor, but back in the day, I was a seafaring, legendary-fish-catching professional!
Jiawei: As for now, well, you've got to stay grounded, you know? A lifetime of adventure on the waves, with your family worrying about you day in and day out... That's no way to keep living forever.
Jiawei: Wouldn't you agree?

Traveler: So, what are you doing?
Jiawei: I'm preparing ingredients, of course, haha!
Jiawei: My wife really loves eating fish and is always hankering after something made from a fresh catch of mine. That's just how it is, you know?
Jiawei: The good news is that I'm a dab hand and then some at fishing. After all, I am an elite fisherman â€” I even once put out to sea to catch a fish of legendary size back in the day.
Jiawei: That was before I met her, of course, and I'm not going to delve into ancient history. Did you need something from me?

## Talk

Traveler: I'd like to buy some fishing supplies.
Jiawei: Ah, so you're a hobbyist too, are you? Well, have a look. I sell nothing but the best!

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Jiawei: See you! May your catches ever swell in size.
