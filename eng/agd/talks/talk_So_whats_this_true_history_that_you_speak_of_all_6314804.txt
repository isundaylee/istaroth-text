Traveler: So, what's this true history that you speak of all about?
Mochizuki: The truth is that the very first shrine on Watatsumi Island is not here at Sangonomiya Shrine. It's actually to the west of the island, where the Statue of The Seven is now.
Mochizuki: After Watatsumi Omikami was slain by the Electro Archon, Sangonomiya Shrine became our sanctuary where we worship Watatsumi Omikami.
Mochizuki: A long time ago, when our ancestors were still suffering deep beneath the waves, it was Watatsumi Omikami who defeated the Dragonheir of the Depths and brought them to the surface where the sun shone...
Mochizuki: The great coral above Sangonomiya Shrine was a gift given by Watatsumi Omikami from its own body, and thus did it gain its name.
