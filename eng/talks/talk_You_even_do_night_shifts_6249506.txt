Traveler: You even do night shifts!?
Shikun: Hey, some tea farmers start toiling away at three or four in the morning! A helping hand's always welcome in that pitch darkness!
Shikun: Someone like me, who isn't busy but has plenty of energy to spare, is the perfect candidate for that sort of night shift. Call me and I'll be there!
Shikun: The wee hours are great for getting things done. It's so quiet, so you can work away without getting distracted!
