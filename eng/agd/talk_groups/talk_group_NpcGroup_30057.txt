## Talk 0

Kaeya: Who would've thought that the Acting Grand Master would ever step out of her office?
Kaeya: Oh my, looks like I'll be quite busy in the near future... but there's no helping that.

## Talk 1

Kaeya: Oh, you've arrived at a most opportune time, Honorary Knight. Klee just invited me to catch lizards with her. Care to join?
Traveler: Do you want to chat?
Kaeya: Sure. Let's take advantage of the precious time left until lizard duty.
Traveler: About why you came to the island...
Kaeya: Let me guess, you're thinking something along the lines of, "Kaeya seized an opportunity to shirk his duties"?
Kaeya: *sigh* Why do you think of me so? Of course I have a special reason for coming here.
Kaeya: Generally speaking, I'm responsible for wrapping up various cases... But this particular incident is special.
Kaeya: You see, not only is the Acting Grand Master here, but the former fiery Cavalry Captain as well. Naturally, I had to see it for myself.
Kaeya: Also, it seems like I ought to appreciate the splendid scenery and enjoy every second of summer.
Traveler: Tell me about these islands...
Kaeya: A lovely place, wouldn't you agree?
Kaeya: When beholding a beautiful view, your expression should complement its beauty.
Kaeya: ...
Kaeya: Just listening to the waves and recalling old memories... is also nice.
Traveler: Tell me about yourself...
Kaeya: Hmm, I just thought of something.
Kaeya: Wouldn't it be great if we could age in reverse? To be a child again and free yourself from the strife of the adult world.
Kaeya: To be like Klee, unrestrained and free to do whatever you want.
Kaeya: Hahaha, do you not also yearn for such a thing?
Traveler: About what happened today...
Kaeya: What's the matter? Diluc's scowl still bothering you?
Kaeya: He's had that expression on his face for years now. He internalizes a lot of his feelings.
Kaeya: So I'm afraid that his face is stuck like that. Just treat him like a big kid.
Kaeya: In my opinion, it would be a good thing if people could stay young forever.
Kaeya: Hm? What is that you ask? Hahaha, would I do such a thing? I wasn't jibing him.
Kaeya: Whether they be adults or children, everyone on this island sure is a source of concern.
Traveler: I won't disturb you.
Kaeya: Going so soon? Huh... Then have a good night.

## Talk 2

Kaeya: So this was Alice's handiwork all along! The letter I received certainly makes a lot more sense now.
Kaeya: She's quite a remarkable person. You must meet her if you get the opportunity.
Kaeya: Even if she does bring her fair share of trouble with her... Then again, I don't mind trouble when it's interesting.
Kaeya: Huh? Did I ever guess what was going on, you ask?
Kaeya: Haha... not a chance. I'm much too naive, I was in the dark the whole time.
