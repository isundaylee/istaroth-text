Traveler: Who are you?
Chang the Ninth: Not to scare you off, but I'm none other than the once-illustrious Chang the Ninth of Feiyun Slope!
Chang the Ninth: Back in Liyue, in the good old days, so many Mora went through my hands every day that I couldn't give you an exact number. Anyone who wanted to do business knew it was me they had to impress!
Chang the Ninth: Hmph, even those big-shot Liyue Qixing would have to move aside if I told them they were in my way!
Traveler: So... why did you move here to live as a hermit?
Chang the Ninth: It was a somewhat... unexpected turn of events. The business started going downhill, so I thought I'd sell the old abode and move out here, where it's peaceful and quiet, to get away from it all.
Chang the Ninth: The ancients had a saying, "He who has not known poverty has yet to become a true man." I might only have this hut and my book collection to my name, but I'm optimistic that my time will come again sooner or later.
Chang the Ninth: I'm wondering about the mineral trade, maybe... Well, I shan't say any more or I'd be handing you a business opportunity on a silver platter!
Chang the Ninth: But when my time comes, everyone in Liyue Harbor is going to know that old Chang the Ninth is finally back again!
Traveler: Do you get on with your neighbors?
Chang the Ninth: You mean those penniless peasants? Ugh, the fact I even have to live near them...
Chang the Ninth: I may be their neighbor now — only due to circumstance I might add — but ohh you mark my words, when I have restored my business to its rightful place in the world, they won't even be worthy to farm the ground I walk upon!
