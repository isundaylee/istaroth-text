# Missing title (3383803375)

Traveler: Take good care of Sudabeh and Iotham.
Kavus: I will. I'm gonna be a good big brother, and I'll never leave them behind! Otherwise, Rana will criticize me.
Kavus: #There will come a day when I become Captain Kavus, free as a seagull. To make it come true, I've been fishing with Dad. These are the fish I caught, I want to give them to you, Traveler!
Kavus: #Um... By the way, Sudabeh said recently she's been learning to cook on her own so that she can be a big girl soon. So if you happen to eat something suspicious she made... well... please don't be hard on her, Traveler!
