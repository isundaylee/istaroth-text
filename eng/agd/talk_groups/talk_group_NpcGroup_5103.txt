Aeife: Take a guess — will Monsieur Neuvillette preside over the next trial? Will Lady Furina make an appearance?

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about Neuvillette...
Aeife: Right! So, he's our Chief Justice, and the one who brought us Melusines to the Court of Fontaine to live.
Aeife: He's always very busy with work, and can only preside over some cases, and his subordinates in the Maison Ordalie handle the rest.
Aeife: But no matter how busy he is, he will still greet us when he sees us — just as he's done for several hundred years now.

Traveler: Could you tell me about Furina?
Aeife: Lady Furina's very lovely, like the soft seafoam reflecting the sunlight.
Aeife: But her temper is... Well, she's hard to read. Sometimes, she's like tempestuous waves, and other times, like stagnant water in a deep pool.
Aeife: I guess gods have more intense emotions than humans, huh?

## Talk

Traveler: I'll be waiting in suspense.
Aeife: Yup, that we will!

Aeife: But her temper was... Well, she was hard to read. Sometimes, she was like tempestuous waves, and other times, like stagnant water in a deep pool.
Aeife: It's been a while since I've seen her though... You know, I've just decided that the next time I see her, I'm going to give her a friendly greeting and my biggest smile!

Traveler: About Furina...
Aeife: Lady Furina's very lovely, like the soft seafoam reflecting the sunlight.
Aeife: But her temper was... Well, she was hard to read. Sometimes, she was like tempestuous waves, and other times, like stagnant water in a deep pool.
Aeife: But I don't feel like that anymore.
Aeife: Lady Furina seemed very cheerful the last time I saw her. She said she might be able to come to the opera house more often! I do hope she does.
