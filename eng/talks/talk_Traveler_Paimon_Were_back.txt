Gorou: #Traveler, Paimon! We're back!
Gorou: I just finished buying some souvenirs around the city. I believe you took a trip to The Cat's Tail, right Kirara? I saw you leaving, at least.
Kirara: Yep. I stopped by to visit my sweet little Diona, but she was nowhere to be found. Such a shame... Well, at least I still got a refreshing drink out of it. Maybe I'll have better luck next time.
Gorou: Still remember our request, you two?
Paimon: Of course! You're after a potion that could increase a person's energy and enhances their physical strength â€” a very practical request if Paimon does say so herself.
Paimon: Our potion-making skills are getting better by the second. We'll have it brewed and ready in no time!
