Traveler: You make both?
Cheven: Yes, that's right. Is anything the matter?
Cheven: To the people of the Children of Echoes, there's little difference between forging accessories and forging weapons. Both involve using phlogiston to process ore.
Cheven: It is also extremely common to adorn weapons and accessories with gems. Any piece of equipment that doesn't have a gemstone engraved on it is of no use at all.
Cheven: On the other hand, if you see someone digging for ore with a chisel that's engraved with row upon row of crystals, you can rest assured, for that's the surest sign that you've got a real expert on the job.
