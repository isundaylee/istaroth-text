# Missing title (3974684039)

Xiangling: Hmm, there's gotta be some wild herbs around here...
Traveler: Xiangling, this gift envelope is for you.
Xiangling: #Traveler, it's you! Wow, thank you so much! It's beautiful!
Xiangling: By the way, sounds like you and Hu Tao were up to something on the night of Lantern Rite... She didn't go into detail, but it must have been big.
Xiangling: I thought we were gonna grab dinner together that night. I set up a whole table of food and everything.
Xiangling: I waited until midnight, but nobody came! So, my dad offered to wait outside while I went to bed.
Xiangling: I tried to keep watch with him, but it was late, and at that point, I couldn't keep my eyes open...
Xiangling: Then, I had a dream that Hu Tao was standing in front of me, brushing my hair with the branch of a peach blossom tree and singing some kind of weird song.
Xiangling: I wanted to grab her and ask her what was going on... But, I couldn't move or make a sound...
Xiangling: In the end, I shouted "don't you scare me, Hu Tao!", nearly flung myself off the bed, and scared my dad all at once.
Traveler: Sorry for making you worry.
Xiangling: Hah, so you admit it! Luckily, Xingqiu filled me in later. He said you were working on some kind of array.
Xiangling: That's not exactly my... thing, but it sounds complicated. By the end, you were probably so hungry you couldn't see straight!
Xiangling: Honestly, you need to start taking care of yourself! I could've at least packed you some rice buns for the road!
Xiangling: Hm... Your punishment is to eat at my place for the rest of the festival!
Traveler: See you.
Xiangling: Okay, see you around!
