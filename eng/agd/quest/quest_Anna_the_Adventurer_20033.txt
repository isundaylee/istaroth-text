# Anna the Adventurer!


## Talk 1

Anna: Traveler, come have a look! What do you think? Does this look good on me?
Traveler: Oh, this uniform...!
Anna: That's right! I passed the Adventurers' Guild exam. That makes me an officially-recognized adventurer!
Traveler: You look awesome!
Anna: Hehe, thanks. I tried to persuade my brother to give the exam a go too, but he refused no matter what I said...
Anthony: I've got no interest in adventures... And anyway, who'll take care of our parents if we both become adventurers?
Anna: Well, then we can bring them along! We can travel the whole world together!
Anthony: You... Alright, alright. You're an adventurer now, so do your best. Leave matters at home to me.
Anthony: But remember, don't get yourself injured, and don't overtax yourself...
Anna: Oh, fine, fine, I get it! Heading out now, I've got a commission to finish!
Anna: Traveler, do you mind coming with me? I've got so many things I want to ask you about being an adventurer!
Traveler: Sure.
Anna: Now let me see. This commission is...
Anna: Transport Balloon Escort!
Traveler: Okay. Let's go!
Traveler: Congratulations!

## Talk 2

Anna: And we're done! Thanks, Traveler. This went pretty well, I think.
Anna: But is this the usual fare for adventurers?
Traveler: There will be others.
Paimon: What's with that hapless tone...
Anna: Is that so... Nice! I'll keep working at it, then!
Anna: Once I've saved up enough Mora, I'll bring my brother and our parents out on a trip!
Anna: My brother always wanted to travel... But I fell ill, and he had to stay back to take care of me.
Anna: But I'm well now, and I've even become an adventurer.
Anna: Hehe. When the time comes, I'll help my brother fulfill some of his dreams too!
Traveler: You'll understand in time...
Anna: Hey, not that tired look...

## Talk 3

Anthony: Please take care of Anna, Traveler. Her excitement might have gotten to her head lately...
Traveler: Do you not want her to become an adventurer?
Anthony: ...
Anthony: I respect my sister's wishes.
Anthony: Now that she's well again after such a long struggle with her illness, she deserves a chance to pursue her dreams.
Anthony: As her brother, I'll support her... all the way.
Anthony: That's all I have to say.
