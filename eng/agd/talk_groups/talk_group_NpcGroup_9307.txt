Beidou: Since we've got some time on our hands, do you wanna take a seat and shoot the breeze for a bit? I brought some drinks if you're thirsty.
Beidou: With me here, we can take whatever this domain has to throw at us.
Beidou: There's no point spending all your time worrying about what lies beyond the horizon. If it's a sunny day, you can snooze away, and if there's dark clouds ahead, you just gotta roll up your sleeves and sail on through the storm! That there is the secret to living a happy life.

## Talk 1

Beidou: There's some pretty tough cookies lurking around in here, huh? Still, nothing to be scared of.
Beidou: If you're out on stormy seas and a giant wave is coming towards you, you only put yourself at risk of capsizing if you try to steer around it. But if you face it head on and take it on the bow, you can split that wave down the middle.
Beidou: I'm used to taking the helm when the storms come. So when we head into battle, feel free to put me up front!

## Talk 2

Beidou: There's a lot of stories about me floating around in Liyue, but I guess the most well-known is the one about me defeating Haishan.
Beidou: I'm ashamed to admit it, but I went into that fight with a huge ego. I thought I'd seen it all and wanted to show people that I could take on the world... Little did I know it would very nearly cost me my life.
Beidou: Ultimately, I still dealt the final blow. But in the end, what got me through it wasn't my arrogant desire to prove myself. It was the fact that I had a whole crew behind me that I cared about a lot.
