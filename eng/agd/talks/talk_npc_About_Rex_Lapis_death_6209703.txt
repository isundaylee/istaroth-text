Chunshui: About Rex Lapis' death...
Chunshui: I heard something about that too...
Chunshui: It may be because I pray to the Anemo Archon regularly... But I sensed bad tidings on the winds a long time ago.
Chunshui: Maybe it was selfish of me only to pray for my husband's safety...
Chunshui: Because now, all of Liyue's people need divine protection.
