Changchang: When is Daddy coming back? Is it too late to write him and ask him for some fortune coins?
Changchang: My friends and I have already done some fortune coin swaps. Seems like there are only ten or so varieties...
Changchang: Daddy's gone off to a far away place, so there's gotta be some different ones over there, right?
Changchang: Of course, I shan't be writing him just some ordinary letter either. It's gotta be a gift, uh... Ugh, what did they call it again...
Changchang: Anyway, it'll be a letter full of words that bring blessings!
