Traveler: I—I doubt so...
Flo: Huh. I do think that the clothes you're wearing do have a designer feel to them, though...
Flo: I've never seen their like before. In fact, I thought that they were some new fashion of a sort... Ah, I'd love to try something like that on.

Traveler: You love fashionable outfits, don't you?
Flo: Sure do!
Flo: Lovely clothes with their own sense of style can sometimes even give their wearers confidence in their beauty. It's a wonderful thing.
Flo: People who are able to design such clothes are awesome. I, too, really love sewing and design work.
Flo: Sometimes, when I see the beautiful clothes worn by people in the city of Fontaine, I think, "Ah, if only I could put something similar on!"

Traveler: Can Melusines wear human clothes, though...
Flo: Well, of course not. Our bodies are very different — even beautiful clothes made for children wouldn't make good direct fits for us...
Flo: But whether we be human or Melusine, our feelings toward lovely clothes are one and the same, and so I wish to create such clothes that Melusines, too, can wear!

## Talk 5

Flo: Ah, I heard about what happened from Virda. Thank you for saving her!
Flo: Sorry for the trouble my little sister caused you. I'll remind her to stay safe in the future...
Flo: Oh dear. How could I ever thank you? ... Oh, I know! Why don't I help you design a set of clothes?
Flo: Really, though, I'm only any good at sewing... So how would tights do? I've heard that the thieves and heroes in those stories all love wearing them...

Traveler: I think I'll pass on the tights...
Flo: Ah, so you don't like them? Well, if you find clothes that you do like, please, tell me.
Flo: I can imitate even the most fashionable outfits perfectly as long as I have something to model my work after. I'm quite confident in my work in this regard!

Traveler: Tell me about Virda...
Flo: She's not injured — thanks to you, of course.
Flo: She seems to have gotten all excited about having been able to help out, though. *sigh* I have to wonder if she heard a word I said about staying safe...
