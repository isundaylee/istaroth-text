Keshen: Real battles are the foundation of military training. Fights against powerful foes are necessary!

Traveler: Opponents?
Keshen: That's right! There are many types of foe...
Keshen: Charge forward during missions and take the lead in fighting bandits. Treat them as your opponents and use all your abilities against them.
Keshen: During drills, I fight against Sergeant Lin with real weapons as if I'm fighting a real opponent, practicing to fight against enemy leaders...
Keshen: Of course, the Sergeant has at least ten more years of training than me, so I usually get knocked down, but he's always careful not to hurt me.
Keshen: You can also have friendly spars with the hired guards during break time to hone your hand-to-hand combat skills.
Keshen: Those will definitely come in handy when you're fighting at close range and can't use your spear.
Keshen: In short, fighting against different opponents will teach you how to fight in different environments.

Traveler: Is your normal training not enough?
Keshen: No, no, no. Our routine training covers dozens of different items, such as basic marksmanship, defensive formation basics, moving in offensive formation, and more...
Keshen: There's nothing to complain about in terms of variety. Unfortunately, the target audience of the training is the majority. That is to say, ordinary soldiers.
Keshen: You'll need to find other ways if you want to become stronger after learning and mastering everything taught by this training.
Keshen: My goal in life is to defeat monsters like Xuanwen Beasts alone, but I have yet to receive Rex Lapis's approval and don't have a Vision.
Keshen: Therefore, I can only keep honing my martial arts and challenging my physical limits.

Traveler: Great point! Talk to you next time!
Keshen: Hmm? Thanks for the recognition. If you have a chance, why don't we have a friendly spar next time?

Traveler: So, the strength of a Xuanwen Beast...
Keshen: That's difficult to quantify.
Keshen: Just like how some people are completely hopeless at martial arts and some are talented geniuses, there are large weak men and slender youths who have extraordinary sword skills...
Keshen: I'm sure some Xuanwen Beasts might be extremely weak to the point that even poorly-equipped hired guards can manage them.
Keshen: We currently have very little information about the strongest Xuanwen Beasts.
Keshen: I'm just estimating here, albeit assuming that they're on the stronger side... But a single paw swipe may be equal to a direct hit from the Guizhong Ballista.
Keshen: *sigh* Can a mortal really block such a mighty blow?
Keshen: ...No, I can't let this discourage me. I need to train harder!
