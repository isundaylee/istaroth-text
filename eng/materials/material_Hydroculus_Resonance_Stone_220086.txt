# Hydroculus Resonance Stone

A talisman that can be used in Fontaine to search for nearby Hydroculi.
A curious talisman that possesses similar properties to the Hydro Statues of The Seven. It seems to be able to detect the Elemental Flow of Hydroculi.
Oculi are by nature scattered pieces of power belonging to the Statues of The Seven. Returning them to the Statues is therefore the reasonable, right, and lawful thing to do.
