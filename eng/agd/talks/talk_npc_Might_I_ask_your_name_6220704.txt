Traveler: Might I ask your name?
Huangshan: Haha, I forgot to say my name.
Huangshan: It's Huangshan.
Huangshan: I'm pretty well known on the merchants' route between Mondstadt and Liyue. I'm thorough in my work, and people so say.
Traveler: What about the rumors on the road?
Huangshan: A dragon attacked Mondstadt the other day, so I'm taking a temporary break.
Huangshan: I can deal with monsters, beasts and bandits no problem, but I'm not trying my luck against no dragon.
Huangshan: Speaking of rumors, this is where the rumors of two nations meet. I'm told the staff here are all informers for the Qixing.
Huangshan: The look on your face suggests you took that seriously. Ahahaha...
