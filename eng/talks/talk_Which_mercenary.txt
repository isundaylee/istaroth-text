Traveler: Which mercenary?
Isami: Oh, I was talking about Mr. Shahin who guards the place.
Isami: I've never seen such an inquisitive person in the Eremites.
Isami: I always thought the Eremites were a group of reserved brutes, but I was gravely mistaken.
Isami: I have nothing against friendly people, but he keeps asking about what's being done here and what's being stored there... It overwhelms me a little.
Isami: It's mainly because he looks so curious, so he doesn't seem like he's scheming something, and I can't bother matra for just a few questions of his...
Isami: So, I have to deal with him as best I can.
