# To Make Cat Ornaments


## Talk 1

Ooshima Junpei: Traveler, you're here! Did you come to pay respects?
Traveler: How's your wood carving going?
Ooshima Junpei: Oh, I'd say that I'm doing fine. I still need to fix the dimensions of the carvings, though.
Ooshima Junpei: According to my initial thoughts, these carvings should fit snugly in a person's palm.
Ooshima Junpei: That way, they can play with it easily.
Ooshima Junpei: Also, other than the carvings themselves, I think I should make some decorations.
Ooshima Junpei: I've seen that when people make these carvings, they will also add some accessories on the side.
Ooshima Junpei: Things like flowers, animals, bases that have flowery patterns, things like that...
Ooshima Junpei: I'd also like to put such decorative bases on my wood carvings. That said, due to sizing issues, we can only put one ornament on one wood carving...
Ooshima Junpei: But I'm thinking that if the decorations are detachable, I can just put on whatever decorations my customers request.
Ooshima Junpei: I'd probably want to start from simpler decorations... Something like Naku Weed.
Ooshima Junpei: So, Traveler, could you help me gather 3 stalks of Naku Weed back to use for reference?
Traveler: I've got your back.
Ooshima Junpei: Sorry, Traveler, but I'll be leaving this in your hands. Come back and look for me once you have those Naku Weeds.
Traveler: Why three?
Ooshima Junpei: If I can get three, I can view them in three different states.
Ooshima Junpei: That way, I should be able to carve the best Naku Weed that I can.

## Talk 2

Ooshima Junpei: Have you gotten those Naku Weeds?

## Talk 3

Ooshima Junpei: Oh, nice! These should do the trick. Thank you so much, Traveler!
Ooshima Junpei: Now, time to do a little investigating. How are we going to carve wood into the shape of Naku Weed...
Ooshima Junpei: If I can make these decorations well enough and have a wide enough variety of them...
Ooshima Junpei: Maybe we'll be able to sell them separately...
