Iara: Ooh, it's you, my teacher! Are you going to teach me some of your brilliant fishing techniques today too?

## Talk

Traveler: How have things gone for you, recently?
Iara: Yup. After learning what you taught me and scattering lots of bait, I learned how to attract fish.
Iara: But catching them can still be pretty tough. Haven't caught too many, but the fish in the surrounding waters sure did get plumper â€” that's something, I guess?

## Talk

Traveler: Just passing through today...
Iara: Oh, no worries then, but please do come fishing with me next time. That way, I'll be able to learn more techniques, and also share in the fish you catch.

## Talk

Traveler: About the earthquake just a while ago...
Iara: Argh, it was so intense that all the fish got scared off!
Iara: Hmm, speaking of that... Did it happen just as Delaroche said it might? Did a whole school of Linebreakers strong enough to shake Merusea Village appear?
Iara: If that's the case, all the more reason for me to guard this fishing spot. I'll show them the strength of my will!
