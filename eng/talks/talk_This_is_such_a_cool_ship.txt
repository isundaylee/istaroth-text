Venti: This is such a cool ship!
Venti: Facing the sea breeze and gazing out at the soaring seagulls... Ah, makes me wanna sing out loud!
Venti: Kazuha, how about I stay here and be the ship's resident bard? What are my prospects?
Kaedehara Kazuha: With your level of artistic finesse, I'm sure nothing will go wrong.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But I'm afraid the sailors aboard are not the most versed in the arts. They probably wouldn't understand the deeper meaning your poetry holds.
Venti: Haha, you can't say that for sure! Poetry is spur-of-the-moment creations. Anyone viewing the same sights and experiencing the same atmosphere would surely understand.
Venti: *sigh* There's a port in Mondstadt too, but I rarely get the chance to board any of the ships.
Venti: Speaking of ships, everything's perfect about this one, except...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm?
Venti: Um, Kazuha...
Venti: Could you tell your Captain that my height says nothing of my age? I'm way past drinking age.
Venti: How often does one get to enjoy a seafood feast on a ship? It'll be a real shame if there isn't anything stronger to enhance the food! Pretty please?
Kaedehara Kazuha: There's... not much I can do about that.
Kaedehara Kazuha: It's not because Captain Beidou's not on the ship right now, but because there's no room for negotiation on this matter.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Even I have to sit in the no-drinking zone every time.
Venti: *whimper* But I don't get drunk after just a few sips... Trust me, I can hold my liquor really well!
