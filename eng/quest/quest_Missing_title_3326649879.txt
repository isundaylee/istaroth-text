### Additional Talk 1

Raimondo: Is there something I can help you with?
Traveler: Why do you think that Nacker is still alive?
Raimondo: Considering the interests of the Institute and my personal point of view...
Raimondo: I do, in fact, hope that both he and that Arkhium Kinetic Core were obliterated in that explosion.
Raimondo: That would mean that the last traces of Edwin Eastinghouse's influence here would be gone for good.
Raimondo: But like I said earlier, that explosion was actually a small-scale Arkhium fragment resonance.
Raimondo: Moreover... most of the Arkhium fragments in the explosion radius were ore waste that have been fully depleted of energy.
Raimondo: Logically speaking, even if a large Arkhium chunk had gone out of control, causing the ore waste to resonate, such a violent explosion should not have occurred.
Raimondo: The only possibility is that someone specially collected Arkhium that has not been depleted from other areas and piled them here.
Raimondo: They then overloaded that large Arkhium chunk on purpose to create an Arkhium resonance, so as to trigger an explosion to cover up certain traces that would've existed otherwise.
Raimondo: Nacker has always conducted research with Edwin and has a good understanding of the nature of Arkhium. It wouldn't take him much effort to do something like this.
Raimondo: Still, that's just my preliminary conjecture. As for what happens next... we'll need to wait for the research institute to conduct a more detailed investigation.
Traveler: But why did he steal this core?
Raimondo: This Arkhium Kinetic Core is the most cutting-edge technology created by the Fontaine Research Institute to date.
Raimondo: It wouldn't be a bad idea to sell it or use it in the development of another project, hmph...
Raimondo: But considering his level of academic expertise... I would rather he sell this Arkhium Kinetic Core for a good price.
Traveler: About the Arkhium Kinetic Core...
Raimondo: Before we discuss this further, I believe Nacker or Ms. Chronie must have mentioned something to you already.
Raimondo: They must have told you that my research projects and those of Edwin Eastinghouse had some overlap.
Raimondo: But this is not entirely accurate... In fact, this Arkhium Kinetic Core is the fruit of my joint research with him.
Raimondo: In theory, if we constantly inject this kinetic core with enough energy, it can easily allow the Experimental Field Generator to run at full power...
Raimondo: After creating this core, we both realized a problem. We could barely find any way to keep injecting it with enough energy to keep it at maximum power.
Raimondo: Edwin and I tried powering it with a mixture of Pneumousia and Arkhium energy, or by connecting large numbers of Arkhium ores in series to create a super-powered group... but neither worked.
Raimondo: That was the situation until we found that giant Arkhium... Although it was always in an inert state, Edwin and I were certain that this ore had unprecedented purity.
Raimondo: We believed that with the right treatment, this ore could definitely output the large amount of energy we needed...
Raimondo: But then Edwin and I had a disagreement. I offered a up a more conservative proposal, but he wanted... to solve the problem rather more quickly.
Raimondo: You should know everything else that happened after that.
Traveler: About Edwin...
Raimondo: He was a genius in the field of scientific research. It's no exaggeration to say that his talent was only second to our first director, Alain Guillotin.
Raimondo: At the same time, he was an... inhuman monster.
Raimondo: Nothing mattered to him other than his scientific research.
Raimondo: Edwin was willing to do anything or pay any price to advance his research.
Raimondo: He once told me that research results were the only remuneration he needed. He said:
Raimondo: "I don't need any remuneration. To me, research itself is the best reward."
Raimondo: However, even though Edwin was a pure researcher, the people under him were all experts... in furthering their own interests, that is.
Raimondo: Some secretly sold research assets, some plagiarized research results, and some used his name to scam others.
Raimondo: They ruined the Fontaine Research Institute's reputation, little by little.
Raimondo: Like I said before, as long as his research could advance, Edwin wouldn't do anything about this.
Raimondo: In this way, they used Edwin's name to take all the Institute's resources for themselves.
Raimondo: The Institute could only continue to conduct detailed reviews on the personnel and funding of Edwin's project team. Mr. Choiseul led many of these review operations personally.
Raimondo: However, in the mouths of such people, these actions were construed as bureaucratic arrogance and distrust of researchers.
Raimondo: More and more conflicts took place between us... and no one knew how to resolve them.
Raimondo: But now... those conflicts no longer exist.
Traveler: About the current situation...
Raimondo: Haha, your question is not a technical one, but rather, an administrative one.
Raimondo: I think you should ask Mr. Choiseul about this instead.
Traveler: Why do you think Nacker stole the core?
Raimondo: Do you still remember me flipping through the pictures Ms. Chronie took in the ruins?
Raimondo: There's one of Nacker working in front of the suppression device. It's quite blurry... but I'm quite certain that his actions are definitely not part of any operational procedure.
Paimon: That doesn't really mean anything, though. Maybe... maybe a thief came flying across from the nearby mountain and stole the core?
Raimondo: Heh, that's most definitely impossible. The energy flow of the Arkhium here is the best anti-theft measure there is. No ordinary person can withstand it.
Raimondo: Besides, the timing of the Experimental Field Generator's activation is simply too perfect. It cannot be a mere coincidence...
Raimondo: I have a preliminary conjecture. Nacker... or should I say, the one who stole the core likely removed the Arkhium Kinetic Core early on, activating the backup energy source.
Raimondo: However, Pneumousia Cores are relatively inefficient energy sources, and they have to keep up a continuous output of energy to reach the activation threshold of this contraption here.
Raimondo: Hence, this person intentionally activated that large Arkhium chunk, creating a modest, but rather noticeable explosion.
Raimondo: This way, when the Institute sent someone to investigate, they would be certain to fix the Arkhium Inhibitor first.
Raimondo: And by the time they realized that they'd have to go to the Experimental Field Generator to retrieve the backup energy supply, the Generator would have already finished charging.
Raimondo: From a technical perspective, such a modus operandi is highly probable, and those within the Institute capable of doing this would only be Edwin, Mr. Nacker, and myself.
Raimondo: I doubt Edwin had the opportunity to do anything to that effect... which leaves two remaining suspects. Myself, and Mr. Nacker.
Traveler: Maybe this was all your doing, then.
Paimon: Yeah! You said that Nacker lied, but you've also been lying all along!
Paimon: Maybe this was all just part of your plan, and you tricked us into escorting you here so you could grab whatever it was you wanted.
Raimondo: Your accusation is not entirely baseless. After this, I will also apply for and submit myself to the Institute's credibility review.
Raimondo: As far as I'm concerned, though, Mr. Nacker is the one more likely to have committed this act. If this really was his doing, then he should be the one with the most to gain from it.
Raimondo: Even if I am listed alongside him as a suspect... his chances of being convicted are certainly greater than mine.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Raimondo: Bye. I hope you have a good day.

### Additional Talk 2

Choiseul: Ah! If it isn't our Honorary Senior Researcher. Welcome!
Choiseul: Can I help you with anything? Or have you come to help me with something instead? Hahaha!
Traveler: About the Institute's current state...
Choiseul: Everything is good! It's better than ever! Now that that egomaniac Edwin is gone, the gang of thieves under him no longer exists either.
Choiseul: More importantly, the Institute has a chance to be reborn!
Choiseul: We can take off the shackles and burdens of the past to focus wholeheartedly on building our foundations once again — that is, to work hard for the well-being of all the people of the Court of Fontaine.
Choiseul: I'm currently gathering some people and preparing a Code of Conduct for our organization.
Choiseul: It will include principles on the use of funds, research asset management methods... and ethical standards that should be observed in scientific research and work.
Choiseul: All research-related behavior at our Institute will have relevant rules and provisions.
Choiseul: Ah... What a wonderful future! It's simply the best!
Traveler: Do you and Raimondo run things together?
Choiseul: No, to be precise, we deal with affairs related to different areas.
Choiseul: Raimondo is responsible for getting scientific work and research back on track, and I'm responsible for everything apart from that.
Choiseul: For example, I'm responsible for arranging funds related to manpower, quarterly budget allocations, re-accommodating visitors, and getting rid of those journalists together with Raimondo.
Choiseul: But our main goal remains the same — to rebuild the Fontaine Research Institute and work hard for the well-being of all the people of the Court of Fontaine.
Traveler: See you.
Choiseul: You go and do what you need to do. The Institute will always welcome you!
