# Revelations from the Past


## Talk 1

Paimon: So the ruins below are the ruins of the... what was he called again? The Sage of the Stolen Flame? Still, the entrance looks like something weird's blocking it...
Manqu: Just as I thought... the Sage's trial has already begun.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Err?
Traveler: Do we need to break that barrier...?
Manqu: I'm afraid that barrier is difficult to break... With all due respect, we must use the correct method to open it.
Manqu: *ahem* According to the accounts of the ancient scrolls of our tribe...
Manqu: The Sage of the Stolen Flame seemed to have strongly believed that humans could guide and lead Saurians, thus attaining a future far brighter than the age of the ancient giant dragons.
Manqu: Perhaps he felt guilty, for he stole the secrets of using phlogiston from none other than dragonkind... And this gnawing guilt led to a hope that humans and Saurians could get along, living in peace as equals.
Manqu: Perhaps that is what drove him to leave behind the token here... According to the ancient scrolls, "Humans and Saurians both have their places..."
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Err?
Paimon: That's about as clear as mud.
Manqu: Sorry, forgive my ineloquence... I believe it means that <color=#00E1FFFF>humans and dragons must each stand in their respective positions</color> to receive the token.
Manqu: Still... To ask a Saurian to act in accordance with what a human wants is difficult indeed.
Manqu: This too is part of the tribe's trials... The reason one must cultivate an understanding between human and Saurian.
Paimon: Hehe, though Paimon doesn't totally get what you're saying, when it comes to an invisible bond, we're la creme de la creme!
Paimon: #Isn't that right, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: Rawr!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: ?
Manqu: Haha, that's the spirit. Now, please try opening the barrier blocking the entrance.
Traveler: Didn't think I'd have to use my wall-phasing jutsu so soon...
Paimon: As if you could even do that!

## Talk 2

#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: #Hey, you did it, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}! Great job!
Paimon: #Paimon's not sure why, but it feels like {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} is getting more and more reliable! That gives Paimon a kind of happy feeling, too.
Traveler: ...Feels way more reliable than Paimon!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: #Hey, no way! And don't you dare agree with {M#him}{F#her}! Meanies, Paimon praises you two just a bit and this is what she gets...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: ...Rraa?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: ...Ooroo, Rooah? Wrroh?
Paimon: Uh... You mean Paimon? Paimon's not angry, and she's not crying!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: ...Ooroo, rawr? Rawr?
Paimon: Okay, fine, fine! Paimon'll "rawr"! Rawr!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: I feel like I can understand him...
Paimon: That's what happens when you spend a lot of time together! Sometimes, Paimon can tell what you're going to cook the moment you reach into your bag to fish out the ingredients...
Paimon: "Hmm, yeah, mmm, hrmm, okay, it's probably... Teyvat Fried Egg!" And Lo! Paimon was right.
Traveler: Paimon, you're terrifying!
Paimon: Hmph! Paimon's got a lot more aspects that are really scary, you just haven't seen them before! ...Whew, Paimon's getting hungry just talking about it.
Paimon: We should hurry up and find the token... Once we find it, we can have a huge feast to celebrate!
Traveler: Okay, let's move out!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: Maybe we've finally got a connection?

## Talk 3

#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wraah... Waah!
Paimon: #That's the first time Paimon's heard {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} make that sound.
Paimon: Still, he's got a point, this is a huge mural! Hmm, let Paimon look... Two people, each holding something round in their hands...
Paimon: Wait, what's with one of them having a weird head?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rraa?
Traveler: Is it a... dragon?
Paimon: Huh, now that you mention it, it does kinda look like a dragon's head...
Paimon: Oh! Paimon gets it. It actually depicts a dragon and a person, each holding a golden ring.
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon feels like she just heard a story about two people taking something or other not long ago...
Traveler: It was the tale Pacal and Manqu were discussing...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr...
Paimon: Like Paimon said, it did remind her of something she'd just heard...
Paimon: *sigh* But if that was really the case... doesn't that mean that of the Sage of the Stolen Flame and the first Pyro Archon... that one of them was a dragon? But which one of them?
Traveler: First, we can rule out the Pyro Archon...
Paimon: Oh, so that means... that the Sage of the Stolen Flame is actually a dragon? Right?
Paimon: Paimon recalls that you saw the same golden design on that floating island...
Paimon: So that Sage was also behind us falling into that place when we first came to Natlan, and is also linked to dragons...?
Traveler: "Chosen of Dragons"...
Paimon: Hmm... So that means that the message back then didn't mean "chosen by the great Tepetlisaurus there"... but by this Sage?
Traveler: #Or perhaps chosen by {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: That's possible too... Hmm... Strange...
Unknown NPC (21618): Chosen of Dragons... Come forward... Come forward...
Unknown NPC (21618): Pass through the corridors to your left and right. The path will unfold before your eyes...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Hrrr?
Paimon: What's the matter?
Traveler: (The golden design says...)
Paimon: Do we have to go through from both sides? Hmm, but it looks like both entrances each have their own barriers and mechanisms... Could it be that humans go one way, and dragons the other?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wrroh...
Paimon: #P—Paimon can't even see this time... {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}, do you think it's too hard? If it is, we can still back out.
Paimon: If it's really too much, we can wait until you're ready and try again. Not like these ruins are going anywhere.
Traveler: No need to push yourself too hard.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Mraaa... Wrroh... Wraa...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Rawr!
Paimon: #{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}... You're a brave fella, aren't ya?
Paimon: Still, get out as fast as you can if things get dangerous! Nothing is more important than your life, not even treasure.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: I believe in you!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Err?
Paimon: Hey, don't say things he can't understand!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: Believe in yourself!
Traveler: If you want to stop, just say so.
Traveler: About the first Pyro Archon and the Sage of the Stolen Flame...

## Talk 4

Paimon: A path through the lava has appeared... Looks like the trial is almost over.
Paimon: That guy from the Saurian Relics Association and the chubby chap from the Children of Echoes kept talking up how dangerous it was, but it looks like there really was nothing to it!
Traveler: In that case, lead the way, Paimon!
Paimon: Whoa! You can't even see the bottom... But we're good friends, so of course we'll go together!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rrooo...
Paimon: #{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}, look! Hehe, we're nearly done!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wrroh...
Traveler: Did you see some strange things, too?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr...
Traveler: Don't be afraid...
Traveler: Paimon and I are here.
Paimon: #Yeah... Though Paimon isn't sure what happened, {NICKNAME}'s right. No matter what, you've got us!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Roooah... Rawr!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: Ooh, looks like he's finally perking up! Okay, looks like we can continue downward... This place does feel kinda dangerous...
Unknown NPC (21618): Chosen of Dragons... Proceed... Eliminate the enemy from the realm beyond...
Unknown NPC (21618): Then you will be granted entry into the final paradise.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Ehrrr?
Traveler: Seems there's danger below after all.
Paimon: Did the golden designs tell you that too?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: #Okay, then let's rest a bit, {NICKNAME}! We'll keep going once you're ready.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Wow, Paimon never imagined there'd be something like this under the lava. So we're really deep underground now, aren't we?
Paimon: So that Sage with the totally impossible name... Hid the token here?
Traveler: No...
Unknown NPC (21618): In this place, I made a pledge with Xbalanque...
Unknown NPC (21618): Now, let go and let the future of humans and Saurians be as it may. Only the enemy cloaked in shadow shall not be forgiven.
Unknown NPC (21618): Chosen of Dragons, prove yourself by facing the mighty foe, that you may ascend the sacred mountain from this place.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: Whoa, what's going on? That sudden chill...
Paimon: S—Something's coming out!

## Talk 6

Paimon: Missing text (2941087050)

## Talk 7

Paimon: Whoa, it looks like this stone tablet lit up!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: (Touch the stone tablet...)
Black Screen Text: As the golden lines light up, shining brilliantly, a fragmented scene surfaces in your mind:
Black Screen Text: The eyes of the great dragon, split in two by the sword of the children of man.\nA seal split asunder, engraved upon the white discs, is mistakenly classified as a hole.
Black Screen Text: One was given to the silver dragon's white claws, one to the resurrected corpse.\nOne was buried beneath the great monument, and one was swallowed into the belly of the headstrong one.
Black Screen Text: A white disc appears beneath your feet, the other obscured in shadow. The great wings shadowing it are raised, and you finally see its drawn, upright pupils.
Black Screen Text: You hear a voice. It says:\n"Glory, glory, the Eternal Empire, Ochkanatlan"\nYou see the person standing before the empty throne, picking up that disc, turning around, and looking at you...
Black Screen Text: #"Wake up, {NICKNAME}, please wake up..."
Paimon: Ah! You finally responded! When you touched that stone tablet, you just froze up and wouldn't react to anything...
Paimon: But look over there！ A round plate with golden etchings on it appeared on the ground! That should be the token we're looking for.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: A golden seal... Engraved on a white disc...
Paimon: Eh? What're you saying?
Traveler: It's nothing...
Paimon: Well, you probably are tired! After all, we sure did a lot today. Let's rest up after we get back!
Paimon: This token looks kinda like a big, round plate... Hmm, so in the mural, both the human and the dragon each had discs like this...
Paimon: Anyway, we got a token! Let's take it back and show it to Manqu!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: I'm just a bit distracted...

## Talk 8

Paimon: Whoa, it looks like this stone tablet lit up!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: (Touch the stone tablet...)
Black Screen Text: As the golden lines light up, shining brilliantly, a fragmented scene surfaces in your mind:
Black Screen Text: The eyes of the great dragon, split in two by the sword of the children of man.\nA seal split asunder, engraved upon the white disc, is mistakenly classified as a hole.
Black Screen Text: One was given to the silver dragon's white claws, one to the resurrected corpse.\nOne was buried beneath the great monument, and one was swallowed into the belly of the headstrong one.
Black Screen Text: The two white discs appear beneath your feet.\nYou pick them up, and the golden seal combines into one, as they merge into one.
Black Screen Text: Soon, you see your face reflected in massive dark pupils.
Black Screen Text: #"Wake up, {NICKNAME}, please wake up..."
Paimon: Ah! You finally responded! When you touched that stone tablet, you just froze up and wouldn't react to anything...
Paimon: But look! The token we're looking for is on the ground, just like the one we found before.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: A golden seal... Engraved on a white disc...
Paimon: Eh? What're you saying?
Traveler: It's nothing...
Paimon: Well, you probably are tired! After all, we sure did a lot today. Let's rest up after we get back!
Paimon: #Okay, that's both tokens... Now {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} should have the right to get cured at the volcano, right?
Paimon: Okay! Let's bring the tokens and go find Manqu!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: I'm just a bit distracted...

## Talk 9

#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr...
Paimon: #{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} looked like he got way stronger... Hmm... Just like at the end of our adventure in Ochkanatlan...
Traveler: Definitely looks stronger.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Raooo...
Traveler: Are you alright?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: He was absolutely killing it during that fight...
Traveler: Yes, most impressive.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr... Rrrooo...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Ehrr?
Paimon: #Hmm, it looks like that's not a power {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} can just use whenever.
Paimon: Though, Manqu did say that it's better not to use power like that too much anyway.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr...
Paimon: #*sigh* ...So where did that weirdo with the hard-to-remember name hide the token? All Paimon wants to do right now is grab {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} and get the heck outta here.

## Talk 10

#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr...
Paimon: #Whoa, it looks like {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} just got stronger! Did something awaken, maybe? Like the power of the Flamelord or something...?
Traveler: Definitely looks stronger.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Raooo...
Traveler: Are you alright?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: He was totally rocking during that fight, and was a really big help...
Traveler: Yes, most impressive.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr... Rrrooo...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Errr?
Paimon: #Hmm, it looks like that's not a power {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} can just use whenever.
Paimon: Though, Manqu did say that it's better not to use power like that too much anyway.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr...
Paimon: #*sigh* ...So where did that weirdo with the hard-to-remember name hide the token? All Paimon wants to do right now is grab {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} and get the heck outta here.

## Talk 11

Paimon: Hey, there's another mural here! Now, what's it show...
Paimon: A huge black dragon, a tree, and some strange person?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wrroh... Rawr!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rraa?
Unknown NPC (21618): Chosen of Dragons... Come forward... Reach out...
Unknown NPC (21618): Reach out your hand... Behold... The sin that will obliterate all...
Paimon: #What's wrong, {NICKNAME}? Why are you just staring at the mural?
Traveler: (Reach out towards the mural...)
Black Screen Text: You witness with your own eyes the gargantuan wings from beyond the world, the once glorious and grand figure now pitiable, having completely sunk into the terrifying shadow.\nThe pitch-black flames scorch the land, and even the white tree nearly withered, and the final envoy's glow shattered and smashed, only able to subsist on the last leaves of the severed roots.
Black Screen Text: The ancient battlefields brought only destruction.\nAfter that time, specters stirred, evil lurking within the dark, and filth flooded forth.\nOnly the last leaves still shimmered in the night, and after that time, only the last leaves in the night swayed with the ripples in the sea of memory.
Black Screen Text: Then, you see something else.\nBut you quickly realize, it is not "you" who sees it.\n"You will understand someday." A voice that seems not to be what it appears whispers by your ear, as though it were laughing softly.\nBut you know, this isn't meant for "you."
Black Screen Text: You see the entire city's annihilation, the buildings collapse, the ash-white monoliths squeezed in midair as they are turned to powder.\nYou see a giant dragon with pupils pierced and a tiny human falling together from a great height, while the world echoes with a sorrowful song, one composed of the agony of dragonkind.\nYou see a man rising from the dead dragon's heart once more, his whole body seemingly wreathed in flame.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rrooo...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Roooah... Ooroo...
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, are you okay? You weren't moving a muscle...
Traveler: What I saw might be kinda hard to explain...
Paimon: Really? Paimon didn't see anything at all! And we're both looking at the same picture... Are you just way more perceptive than Paimon?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Roar!
Paimon: #Ah! That's {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}'s voice! Sounds like it's coming from over there... Oh, Paimon sure hopes nothing bad happened...
Paimon: Hurry up, we need to go look!

## Talk 12

Paimon: Wow... Looks like the real entrance to the ruins is over there! And just like the entrance to the first tunnel, there's a strange barrier.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr... Rawr!
Paimon: #Yes, just like at the entrance. {NICKNAME} must stand <color=#00E1FFFF>below the yellow device</color> on the left, while {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} stands <color=#00E1FFFF>below the green device</color> to the right...
Paimon: Though, it's pretty high up this time...
Traveler: And the route is different too...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rooo...
Paimon: #Don't worry, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}! We'll only be separated for a little bit, but we'll still be in sight!
Paimon: If you're scared, just raise your claws towards us and roar as loud as you can!
Paimon: We'll wave back, so don't be scared, okay?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Raah, raah... Rawr!
Traveler: Rawr!
Paimon: #Don't talk like {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}! What if you actually manage to "rawr" something in its language, and {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} misunderstands?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr, rawr!
Paimon: Well, don't you look happy all of a sudden.
Paimon: Paimon just doesn't get you. When are you happy, and when are you scared?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Roo?
Paimon: You sure seem to be in good spirits! Alright then, let's try opening up that gate.
Traveler: #{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}, try going over there.
Paimon: And once it's open, we'll meet in front of the door!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
