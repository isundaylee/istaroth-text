Pyrrho: Who are you?
Pyrrho: This is no place for you. Please, go back.

## Talk 1

Pyrrho: Though Lady Sorush speaks for you, I will not be so lenient should you make any suspicious movements!
Traveler: Look who sounds all reliable.
Pyrrho: Hmph. Of course. I am one of the oldest qualified members of our Order, after all.
Pyrrho: I am not quite the equal of our Vijnanapati, but as one of the desertfolk who have lived here for generations, the Order and I are as one by blood.
Pyrrho: So if you encounter any issues, you can ask...
Pyrrho: No, wait! No. I won't be answering any of your questions!
Traveler: So, about your Vijnanapati...
Pyrrho: He's a very knowledgeable scholar! He knows more than anyone I've ever met.
Pyrrho: We Skeptics were once a Darshan within the Akademiya, but our traditions of knowledge have been eroded after hundreds of years here in the desert, far from the city.
Pyrrho: It's all thanks to our Vijnanapati that we are recovering our ancient traditions. With him around, our Order shall soon reclaim our lost glory!
Traveler: Don't worry, you shan't hear questions from me.
Pyrrho: Hmph. As it should be.

## Talk 2

Pyrrho: To think that something like this would happen. What a disgrace...
Pyrrho: As I thought, stuff regarding knowledge doesn't really suit me all that much. Too complicated.
Traveler: Tell me about the Order of Skeptics...
Pyrrho: Our top priority is choosing a new Vijnanapati, but as you can see, we do not have anyone who can currently fill that role.
Pyrrho: However, we have already asked Elder Aryadeva to invite an exceptional researcher to come over from the city.
Pyrrho: We have stood sentinel here these hundreds of years, and we have seen many a crisis through in our time. This is but a small problem. Don't worry about us!
Traveler: Not going over to the camp?
Pyrrho: All the more I should stand guard here at a time like this. If some ill-intentioned villains sneak in, things might really get bad.
Pyrrho: Even Miss Sosi told me not to go running around. She must rely on me quite a bit, I think.
Traveler: I'll leave you to it, then.
Pyrrho: Haha, see you, then.
