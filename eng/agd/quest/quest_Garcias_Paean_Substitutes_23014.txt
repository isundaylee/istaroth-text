# Garcia's Paean: Substitutes


## Talk 1

Lutong: Sir, I most sincerely suggest that we find a way to pay.
Garcia: They were more like bandits than merchants! How could they ask for such a high price for just a couple of insignias?
Lutong: Perhaps they noticed how your eyes lit up when you saw their goods.
Traveler: What do you want the insignias for?
Garcia: Traveler! Your timing is always most opportune...
Garcia: Thanks to your help last time, I have basically produced an acceptable lubricant.
Garcia: However, I encountered another problem soon after that. While reproducing some of the parts, I found that... their excessively hard material will damage the other parts.
Garcia: Moreover, these excessively hard parts would crack, to different extents, upon even the slightest impact...
Garcia: Thus, I began searching for a material that is both hard and flexible.
Garcia: After relentless research...
Lutong: ...And after relentlessly hassling Mr. Ahangar.
Garcia: I thought that I could find the material I sought in the insignias that the Treasure Hoarders carry around with them.
Garcia: But those merchants may as well have been Treasure Hoarders, the way they were robbing me!
Traveler: So this is where I come in, yes?
Garcia: I should carve your name on the main bearing of my Numbering Machine! I can't express my gratitude enough!
Traveler: Eh, I'll help you find some.

## Talk 2

Garcia: I assume you have obtained the insignias, yes?

## Talk 3

Garcia: Thank you very much, Traveler. These should suffice.
Garcia: I will have to reproduce the gear first... Um, no, I should tackle the problem with the bearings first...
Lutong: Here's your payment, Traveler.
Lutong: Given the current circumstances, we are probably in for some long-term cooperation.
Lutong: Ugh, Mr. Garcia's accounts... Sorting them out really is a headache...

## Talk 4

Garcia: Oh my! These insignias certainly are of high quality!
Garcia: I will have to reproduce the gear first... Um, no, I should tackle the problem with the bearings first...
Lutong: Here's your payment, Traveler.
Lutong: Given the current circumstances, we are probably in for some long-term cooperation.
Lutong: Ugh, Mr. Garcia's accounts... Sorting them out really is a headache...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Lutong: I submit that we must earn some Mora, sir.
Lutong: I have heard that there is a theater in Sumeru City and that they are looking for someone to do some calculations for them.
Lutong: Besides, the stage crew... You know, they earn quite some Mora, but they have no idea how to keep track of it.
Lutong: I sense opportunity here, sir.
Garcia: Why, your talent in accounting and business is most astounding, my dear Lutong...
Garcia: Still, give me a second, let me think...

### Additional Talk 2

Garcia: Ugh... Lutong, I need a hand...
Lutong: Sir, you'd better go back and get some sleep.
Lutong: Traveler, perfect timing! Come over here. I would like to ask a favor of you.
Traveler: What's wrong with him?
Lutong: Well, in a word... Mr. Garcia had too much coffee and too little sleep.
Lutong: Fortunately, it's coffee he drank, not wine.
Garcia: Lutong, uh... We have to find some more insignias... You know, the ones that the Treasure Hoarders carry around with them...
Garcia: Traveler! You are here. Sorry, I didn't see you there.
Garcia: Would you like to get me some of those insignias? Just a few will do.
Traveler: You should take a break.
Garcia: It's okay. I'm fine. I know what I'm doing. It's just that my hands play tricks on me.
Lutong: Anyway, please bring back some insignias, and you will get paid.
Garcia: Once you've got it, just bring it to me. I want to take a closer look. A perfect bearing must be made this time...
Traveler: Never thought coffee was that effective.
Lutong: It's not the coffee. Mr. Garcia doesn't want to sleep...

### Additional Talk 3

Lutong: Luckily, Mr. Garcia doesn't drink...
Traveler: Have you been in correspondence with Kaia?
Lutong: Unfortunately, Ms. Kaia hasn't sent back any letters yet.
Lutong: And my plan to send letters to Ms. Kaia failed because I didn't know where to send them...
Lutong: Have no idea where Ms. Kaia is traveling now...

### Additional Talk 4

Garcia: Well, these insignias will be enough. I... Ugh! My head is starting to hurt again.
Lutong: Sir! You have to take these pills right now!
Lutong: Traveler, please take these as your reward. I'll take Mr. Garcia back first.
Garcia: Insignias! Don't forget the insignias. Make sure they are kept properly!
Lutong: Don't worry sir. They are absolutely safe with me.
