Housein: It takes courage to maintain a peaceful life too.

Traveler: Did you run into some trouble?
Housein: No, no. It was just a thought.
Housein: I used to be a sailor. I've seen every kind of storm you could imagine, and not even a shipwreck could get the better of me.
Housein: The way I see it, gales and tidal waves are nothing compared to always trying to keep steady in life.
Housein: I guess what I'm trying to say is, planting a seed is easy, but raising that little sapling into a mighty tree is where the real work lies...
Housein: But don't let my brother Hassan hear that, or he'll start lecturing me again for being ungrateful, haha.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Housein: See you.

Traveler: It does sound a little...
Housein: Really?
Housein: You wouldn't think so if a Mahamata kept asking you to move the stall here and there until you found a place that "doesn't affect the image of the city"...
Housein: In that case, even the experience of surviving ten shipwrecks wouldn't help so much.
