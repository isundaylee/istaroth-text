Traveler: The new Grand Conservator?
Qushji: Yes... A youngster like you should be better informed than me.
Qushji: Everyone in Sumeru City is paying close attention to the matter, be it an ordinary researcher like myself or a barber in the downtown area.
Qushji: If the new Grand Conservator is interested in astrology, he might apply for some funding and restart the use of those hydromantic instruments.
Qushji: I can also benefit from his influence and no longer have to stick out my old neck again.
Qushji: So that means... I'd prefer to have Rifaet be the next Grand Conservator.
