# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Charlotte: Well... I'd like to take some photos for work, if it's alright with you?
Charlotte: I'd love to do a story about that big plump talking finch, for example. Now that would be an interesting read!
Traveler: You'd have to ask Tubby for her permission on that...
Charlotte: Ahh, so Tubby's its name... Don't worry, I'm a professional! I always make sure to get people's consent before publishing anything that's specifically about them.
Charlotte: Speaking of consent, would you have any objections to the general public learning about this wondrous teapot of yours?
Traveler: Please keep my poor teapot out of the talons of The Steambird, Charlotte...
Charlotte: Sure thing. If you're not comfortable with me reporting on it, I'll keep it out of the news.
Charlotte: But... Could you at least tell me... who made this teapot for you?
Traveler: It was an adeptus from Liyue.
Charlotte: An adeptus? Wow! Uh... Maybe you could introduce me? I'm so fascinated by the adepti — I'd love to learn more about them.
Charlotte: I hear there's all sorts of rules and taboos you have to observe when you're seeking an adeptus... Are you able to go over all of that with me?
Traveler: It's not that complicated. I can just take you there.
Charlotte: Really!? Amazing. Well that settles it — I'll put it in my schedule and come find you when I'm ready. No backing out, okay?
Charlotte: ...I knew you were well-connected, but wow, fraternizing with the adepti? That's really incredible.
Charlotte: Now that I've got a friend like you, I'll never need to worry about networking again! Hahaha...
Charlotte: An exclusive interview with an adeptus... What would a good title be? ..."Investigating an Adeptus"?
Charlotte: No, no, no, it needs to sound more reverent — they'd probably have me thrown down the mountain for suggesting that...
Charlotte: Journey to Jueyun... Ooh, that's it! I think I'll go with: "Journey to Jueyun: Liyue's Pilgrim Trail."
