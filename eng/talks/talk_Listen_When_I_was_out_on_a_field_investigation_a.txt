Message: "Listen! When I was out on a field investigation a few days ago, I saw a huge beast, it was beautiful, absolutely stunning!"
Message: "Although there were several mountains between us, the moment I went to grab my Kamera, it jumped up and just disappeared... Could it have been one of those Adepti that I've heard about in the legends of Liyue!?"
Reply: "Adepti have always gathered at Chenyu Vale since ancient times, and meeting an Adeptus isn't a miracle that only happens once every thousand years."
Reply: "If this is true, your destiny seems to be entangled with the adepti. Why don't you ascend to Yilong Dais and offer a stick of our famous Crane Crown Incense to them to pray for your good fortune to last?"
