Traveler: Maybe it's because they have no choice...
Ami: What type of people can only cook outdoors? Is it because they don't have a home?
Ami: Then they really don't have a choice. That's sad.
Ami: But my dad has a home. Why does he still set up a fire and pot outside?
Ami: Is dad doing this for the homeless people?
Ami: Hmm... I think I get it now.
Ami: Wait, that's not right. Why does dad set up a fire and pot outside for himself, too?
Ami: I don't get it now!
