Paran: Ah, it's you. Welcome.
Traveler: How have you been?
Paran: Not much has changed. I've got as much work to do as before... but that's fine. Better to have something to do rather than nothing.
Paran: *sigh* Were I to go wandering around, I fear people would start talking again, *sigh*...
Traveler: About Quilla...
Paran: I never imagined that Uncle Hawka had commissioned her to frame me and drag me down into the mud...
Paran: I'm sure you've heard the talk about how quite a few family members of mine have been expelled from the tribe. Yet here I remain.
Paran: Those who've headed out from the tribe to the rest of Natlan sometimes send messages to me, and Uncle Hawka once did just that, saying he could help me find work at the Stadium of the Sacred Flame...
Paran: How could I agree to that? I prefer my current life, so I hope they just give up and quit bothering me â€” and the sooner, the better.
Paran: Speaking of which, the Saurus Crackers they've supplied have been of really good quality, apart from that last batch... If only we could get our hands on them someplace else.
Traveler: I shan't disturb you any longer.
Paran: Have a safe journey.
