Traveler: About Bimarstan...
Paimon: Whoa, healthcare is FREE in Sumeru?
Traveler: Are you feeling unwell, Paimon?
Paimon: No, not right now. Thanks for asking, though.
Paimon: Hehe... Eating the street food on every corner has never sounded so tempting!
Traveler: Your stomach is going to punish you for that!
Paimon: If so, Paimon'll go see a doctor and get treated — it's all for free! It'd be a waste not to take advantage of this, don't you think?
Traveler: Maybe... but then again...
Paimon: *gasp* Oh no! So no more delicious food, then?
Traveler: That, plus the doctor would make you take the most bitter-tasting medicine ever.
Paimon: O—Okay... Maybe Paimon needs to reconsider this idea...
Traveler: The treatment would likely include a restricted diet.
