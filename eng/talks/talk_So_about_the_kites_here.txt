Traveler: So, about the kites here...
Zhenyuan: Oh? Are you wondering where I got them from? Well, they're all home-made by myself and my family!
Zhenyuan: Don't you worry, I've been learning this craft from my aunt Granny Shan since I was a kid. I've been in this line for over a decade now, so rest assured, my handiwork's fine as fine can be.
Zhenyuan: Ah, she was pleased as punch to hear that this year's theme was kites.
Zhenyuan: But she also told me in her letters of how she couldn't wrangle with those new Fontainian devices, so I came over to help her out.
Zhenyuan: You could say that kite-making's a family craft. If you like 'em, feel free to buy a few more!
