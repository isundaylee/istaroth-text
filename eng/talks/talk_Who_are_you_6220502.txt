Traveler: Who are you?
Qingzhou: My name is Qingzhou, my liege. I might add that I consider myself a poet, if I may be so bold.
Qingzhou: In a few years' time I shall have to inherit the family business. I gave my word to meet my father back home in three years' time.
Qingzhou: In the meantime, I am on something of a poetic pilgrimage in Liyue; I thought I would avail myself of the relative freedom one tends to be afforded in the years before fully fledged adulthood.
Qingzhou: I merely wish for the chance to spread my poetic wings and see how far they carry me... before I either crash or get shot down, that is. Hahahaha.
Traveler: Tell me about your pilgrimage.
Qingzhou: I've been to all of the Lord of Geo's sacred sites, which has already given me some inspiration to work with.
Qingzhou: But all the true marvels to be beheld in terms of Liyue scenery take place in a semi-mystical realm. There is a saying about Liyue's name that captures this very idea: "As man hides Li in a box, so nature hides Yue between the clouds," Li being a precious ceramic ornament and Yue referring to the moon.
Qingzhou: The next thing for me to do is to seek guidance from the adepti.
Qingzhou: There are legends throughout Liyue of people becoming adepti and ascending to the celestial realm in broad daylight. They say that to take a single visit to the island in the clouds is to say goodbye to the world for many a year.
Qingzhou: In other words... Once you set off down this path, you'll get lost in the clouds â€” and then who knows when you'll come back down to earth...
Qingzhou: Hahahaha...
