# Farewell, Final Saurus Cracker


## Talk 1

Paimon: Why are there Saurus Crackers here? This letter...
Paimon: So Quilla was the mastermind, just like Paimon thought! Even if it was for an unexpected reason... Ugh, Paran's got rotten luck for sure.
Paimon: Just thinking about how Taruka and Oberon might be imprisoned in the camp in front of us makes Paimon feel bad about doing nothing... They didn't do anything wrong.
Paimon: #Hmm... Traveler, let's think of a way to save them, shall we?
Paimon: If we can *hide amidst the Iktomisaurus patrol squad*, maybe we'll have an easier time getting in!

## Talk 2

#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Raaaawr!
Oberon: Cooo?
Paimon: Huh... Is that you, Oberon?
Oberon: Croooo!
Paimon: ...You've, ah, grown a lot since we last met...
Paimon: Guess Taruka was right about you gaining weight easily. Oh right, where is he? Why isn't he with you?
Oberon: Cooo... Crrooo...
Paimon: Um, at any rate, we should probably get out of here first!
Paimon: Now that we've found Oberon, we don't have to hide anymore, right? Paimon's still worried, though, we don't know where Taruka is... We gotta hurry!

## Talk 3

Quilla: Since you've managed to find your way here, I suppose I can finally drop the "good merchant" act. I need a breather from dealing with all the idiots.
Paimon: You meanie! How can you pin the blame for your crimes on other people? Everyone got the wrong idea about us thanks to you!
Quilla: I'm a villain. Is it not natural for a villain to do bad things? Besides, doesn't the fact that those three idiots misunderstood prove that I'm good at what I do?
Quilla: Haha, and now I'm going to do something more wicked still! This time, you're not going to get away.
Quilla: Go get them, Furball!
Furball: Gwoooo!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: #Let's go, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}!
Paimon: #{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}? Are you really gonna take on someone that much bigger than you?
Oberon: Crrooo...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Raaaawr!
Paimon: Oberon looks kinda out of it. Is he just worried about Taruka, or has he eaten too many Saurus Crackers...?
Paimon: #Maybe {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} really wants to cheer him up, so he bravely stepped out to protect us?
Quilla: The things in this world that courage alone cannot change outnumber the sand grains of Sumeru. Compared to something illusory like that, absolute control is more reliable.
Quilla: Attack!
Paimon: #Amazing! {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} dodged the attack! That's just what Tepetlisaurs are good at, not even the sovereign of the skies can touch 'em!
Traveler: Attack.
Paimon: #{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} is ready to attack!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: The attack hit! It dealt... almost no damage!?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: Well, getting a hit in is already pretty impressive! Phew— Paimon's kinda feeling tired already. Have we really only gone one round? What's going on...
Quilla: It's my turn now, right? Attack!
Paimon: #{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} quickly assumes a defensive stance to weather the opponent's fierce assault! He successfully blocks it!
Quilla: Wait, your Saurian defended on his own right after attacking! Tch, despicable rule breaker...
Traveler: The best way to win a turn-based game is not to take turns!
Paimon: What should we do next?
Oberon: ...Krraaaaa!
Paimon: Huh? Oberon seems to be pulling himself together!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Raaaawr!
Paimon: Paimon doesn't understand what they're saying, but it looks like they've reached some kind of... mutual understanding...?
Traveler: Use a Coordinated Attack.
Paimon: Here we go! Show us what the flight school's future star is capable of!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: #Oberon has blocked the opponent's aerial escape route, and {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} is launching an attack! A brilliant coordinated strike!
Paimon: That's a lot of damage Furball's taking! Did it eat a bad hit to the foot? Like, "stubbing your toe against the corner of a table," bad? Either way, the opponent seems shaken up and unable to move!
Traveler: Attack, but I'm the one attacking.
Paimon: #You could do that... but c'mon, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} doesn't get lots of chances to show his stuff as-is, so stop being so childish!
Oberon: Kraaaa!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: #Oh? It looks like {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} and Oberon have a plan...
Paimon: Saurus Crackers? Where did these Saurus Crackers come from?
Oberon: Coo! Krraaa!
Paimon: Wait, were you hiding them under your wings? What a cunning little Saurian... Taruka must have such a hard time dealing with you.
Oberon: Crrooo...
Quilla: Now's not the time! Hey! Stop!
Paimon: Huh? Furball ignored her command and ran towards the Saurus Crackers! The chance to recover 5 HP is just too tempting!
Paimon: Little does it know that it's the Saurian being served on that plate!
Black Screen Text: #In summary, the battle continued on in this way, each party trading hits.
{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} acted courageously, of course, like he was trying to prove himself. Though he would not ever be considered an outstanding student at the flight school, he could still use his other abilities to help his companions.
Surprisingly, even Oberon's unexpected weight gain helped. Now granted a larger physique than the average Qucusaurus, he closed off the aerial battlefield and dealt Furball a heavy blow...
Black Screen Text: Quilla herself proved useless in a fight, and thus fled after Furball lost the will to fight.
"You damned rule breaker! You... You won't win that easily next time! Just you wait and see!"
After reciting the trite lines that petty villains such as herself are wont to say, she ran away with the injured Furball.
Paimon: Oh! Paimon forgot to ask her where Taruka is...
Oberon: Crooo...
Paimon: Hey, cheer up for now. Taruka's a smart kid. He'll be fine!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Raaaawr!
Paimon: #Yes, that's what you think too, right, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}? C'mon, Oberon, let's get you back to the flight school first!
Traveler: Persuade the opponent to surrender.
Paimon: If words could solve problems, why would there be so many conflicts in the world?
Paimon: Ahem... Paimon's just saying that it isn't likely to work.
Traveler: Capture it with a magical item.
Paimon: ?
Traveler: Let's run away now!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wooo... Rrroo...
Paimon: #C'mon! You're even getting {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} down now!
Traveler: Defend.
Paimon: Wait, we're two against one here. Our opponent probably can't attack both targets at once, so isn't this a waste of a turn?
Traveler: Use an item.
Paimon: Eat Saurus Crackers to recover 5 HP!
Paimon: ...Not that that's necessary!
Traveler: Run away.
Paimon: C'mon, things are going well. Why are you still thinking about running away!?
Traveler: Defend.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rooo... Rawr!
Paimon: #{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} seems to feel like defending too conservatively will lead to wasted opportunity. He's getting ready to attack!
Traveler: Use an item.
Paimon: There's nothing we can use right now! Also, don't you think it's a bit too late to set Beast Trap now?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rooo... Rawr!
Paimon: #Oh! {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} is ready to attack!
Traveler: Run away.
Paimon: This isn't the time to run away!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wrrooo... Rawr!
Paimon: #Even {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} gets it! Look, he's ready to attack!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Huh? Taruka! You're back already!
Taruka: #Mr. Traveler! I'm so glad you're okay... I've told my sister and everyone about what happened. Lamizana's just as big of an idiot as I thought...
Oberon: Crooo...
Taruka: Yes, even dumber than you, birdbrain!
Oberon: Crooo...
Paimon: #Okay, okay, guess he's really upset after being separated from you for so long. Also, he worked super well with {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} just now!
Traveler: There's still room for more improvement.
Paimon: Well, we're still talking about a little Saurian, here! As long as you treat him right, Taruka, Paimon's sure he'll grow into an outstanding Qucusaurus!
Oberon: Kraaaa!
Paimon: Speaking of which, how did you get back here? Did someone find you and save you?
Taruka: I escaped by myself. I wanted to bring Oberon with me, but he was busy eating Saurus Crackers and wouldn't move no matter what I did. I got angry, so I left by myself.
Paimon: Huh? It was that easy?
Taruka: After figuring out the movement patterns of the Saurian guards, I realized there was an opening I could use to escape. Got out of there smoothly afterward.
Paimon: Y'know, you might just be the most reliable one here...
Lamizana: What took you so long? I was just about to settle matters with that liar... a—and officially apologize to you guys, of course... I was way too arbitrary, and almost framed innocent people.
Traveler: Too late now.
Paimon: That's right! You only appeared after everything ended. If that isn't trying to steal credit, then what is?
Lamizana: I haven't any leg to stand on, so I'll pay you the agreed compensation or whatever you want from me. I won't be stingy about it. You can even punch me if it'll make you feel better!
Lamizana: I'm a real man, so I won't try to weasel out of my responsibilities.
Traveler: #We'll get {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} to give you a punch.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Lamizana: Ouch! Ow! I haven't been hit, but it already hurts! Please stay your merciful hands... and feet!
Paimon: Didn't you just say you're a real man who won't try to weasel out? How pathetic.
Paimon: #Forget it, we're not that petty. Don't you agree, Traveler, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Lamizana: Thanks for forgiving me. The flight school... well, it has no doors, but its figurative doors will always be open to you.
Taruka: #Since you and {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} are so close, I wanted to ask you for the secret to getting along well with little Saurians!
Paimon: Hehe, no problem. We'll be back later if we get the chance!
Traveler: #I'll have {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} kick you in the toes.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: I request monetary compensation! And my participation prize.
Paimon: So you haven't forgotten about the participation prize...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Temach: We still have a few more flying challenges. Details are written on the board. Give 'em a try if you're keen... Of course, there are prizes to be won.
Traveler: About the Pakpaka Flying School...
Temach: Honestly, I have no clue why it's called that. But speaking of Pakpaka... Have you ever heard the story of Kuntur and the evil sorcerer Rumi?
Temach: The warriors of the tribe were defeated by that wicked mage, and he turned them into Pakpaka... which doesn't sound all that good. Maybe Pakpakas fly very quickly, or something — I don't know.
Traveler: About Lamizana...
Temach: Haha... He's a good fighter, but not necessarily a good teacher. And as an opponent in flying competitions... I guess he's passable?
Temach: But I mean, why would you come here if you didn't have issues with flying? So, if I were to be too strict... *sigh* Well, it's not like things like this have never happened in the past.
Temach: That's why I focus on encouraging people nowadays. I'm sure that approach will get results just fine too.
Traveler: Gotta go.
Temach: See you. You're welcome back any time.

### Additional Talk 2

Cisik: Welcome to Pakpaka Flying School!
Traveler: What do you do here?
Cisik: We give all cadets the necessary guidance and help they need. Things have changed a lot, you know. Back in the day, students couldn't expect that kind of tender loving care.
Cisik: But then there was this one time when the coach was a little... strict with their words, and the student in question just happened to have quite a temper... *sigh* Yeah, that's not a fun one to talk about.
Cisik: Anyway, our teaching policy's been shaken up since then. And I mean, nobody slaps a smiling face, and nobody hates compliments, am I right?
Traveler: I'll be off, then.
Cisik: Here's to a pleasant day!
