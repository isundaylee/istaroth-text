Traveler: You seem to have skipped a fair bit of that story...
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: The colors, shapes, and firing intervals of fireworks all have different meanings. Inazumans in the past used this method to communicate with each other from somewhere far away.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: It takes a lot of skill and knowledge to manufacture fireworks. Using the powder from different ores will result in different colors.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: I'm the best at tuning the color of these fireworks. I can make any color that you pick, even black or white!
