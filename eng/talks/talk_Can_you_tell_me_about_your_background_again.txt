# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Can you tell me about your background again?
Liben: I'm Liben, and once upon a time, I sold curios.
Liben: I've been doing good business recently.
Liben: Before that, I ran the Nod-Krai trade route, hoping to make myself a small fortune.
Liben: But... I'm still here, so I'm sure you know how that turned out!
Traveler: What kind of business are you talking about?
Liben: Simple. You find me a few basic everyday items, cooking ingredients and the like, and then you trade them with me for a Box o' Marvels, full of all kinds of nice little treasures.
Liben: Keep in mind that I've filled these Boxes o' Marvels with the fortune I made in my time as a seller of curios. There's no booby prizes to be found here, and I treat all my customers the same.
Liben: Why box them up and turn it into a lucky draw, you ask?
Liben: What can I say, people like a gift box. It just makes everyone a little more inclined to get involved.
Traveler: How do you earn any money like this?
Liben: Hmm, fair point. Perhaps I should explore business opportunities in Natlan next time after all, eh?
Liben: Or maybe hire a few people for protection and make another trip to Nod-Krai, that might work too...
Liben: To be honest, though, I'm getting pretty tired...
Liben: Guess I'll take a break before making any more plans!
