Traveler: Could you tell me about the "prophecy"?
Augereau: Well, I've always been for believing in such mysterious things.
Augereau: And as a result, I've found myself saddled with conflicting rumors. If I were to become too obsessed with them, I'll be stuck with a troubled life... for life, you know?
Augereau: So yeah, I think you can believe in such things, but there's no point thinking too hard about them. I'm just an ordinary person without much ambition to change fate.
Augereau: So whichever of the rumors turns out to be true, I'll be fine with it.
