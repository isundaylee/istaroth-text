# Talk Dialog

Traveler: How are things lately?
Draff: Well, what can I say? The last Springvale Cookoff was crowded with nearly the whole town discussing every topic under the sun. The better the conversations, the more meat they eat, you know.
Draff: As head of all the hunters in this town, I guess you could say I'm also the brains behind 'em all too, haha.
Draff: As for my great ancestor, Olaf, his relatives have all succumbed to the grip of time. What a pity...
Draff: When hunting season's over, I should show my respect for my ancestors by going out and drinking with him. It always feels kind of weird to say that...
