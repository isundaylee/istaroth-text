# Neko Is a Cat: A "Good Turn" Comes Late


## Talk 1

Neko: You're here. The stone human says that he's just about done.
Neko: Come with me. The stone human is just over there.

## Talk 2

Ooshima Junpei: Haha, the Lady Priestess is so overjoyed. This "Hibiki" must really have been someone of great importance to it.
Traveler: Trouble is, we don't know where she is...

## Talk 3

Etsuko: Indeed, "Hibiki," "Asase Shrine," "Domeki"... these names are all quite concerning, actually.
Traveler: And where did you two pop out from?
Etsuko: Well, you were all making such a racket, so of course we'd come over.
Etsuko: Still, there's something that I think you must know.
Etsuko: Taisuke, if you'd do the honors.
Taisuke: Ah right, of course, Miss Etsuko. So what we're going to say... concerns Seirai Island.
Taisuke: The history of this place is very obscure, and while the Guild has attempted to specifically search for information regarding it, we've found very little...
Taisuke: According to what information we did manage to get, this was a gathering place for pirates several centuries ago. Then, it was the Shogunate who cleared all the pirates out and moved the inhabitants to other places...
Taisuke: Unless I'm mistaken, this "Domeki" we speak of may well have been the pirate leader "Ako Domeki," who chose to fight the Shogunate head-on. The records do clearly record his name.
Taisuke: According to that same information we have, this Ako Domeki led his pirate fleet in a naval battle against the Shogunate.
Taisuke: They were quickly suppressed and forced to flee back to Seirai Island...
Taisuke: But as the Shogunate fleet pursued him, a sudden storm erupted on Seirai Island.
Taisuke: Ako Domeki's fleet and the Shogunate's were both caught in the ensuing storm... and they were all lost.
Traveler: A storm...
Etsuko: I'll pick things up from there. The biggest mystery here, of course, is the sudden emergence of that storm.
Etsuko: Although Ako Domeki's fleet was also hit by the storm and was nearly wiped out as a result, the fleet that the Shogunate sent was also all but lost with all hands, with the remnants being forced to retreat to Narukami Island. It would be quite some time before the fleet was ready again.
Etsuko: So the timing of that storm was just too good. Almost as if... someone was specifically controlling it.
Etsuko: I'm sure you remember the Warding Stones on this island. Those had been intentionally unsealed.
Etsuko: And once we sealed them again, the storm on the island became calm once more.
Etsuko: I'm not going to jump to conclusions immediately, but my gut says that those incidents are definitely related.
Taisuke: Well, we could ask Lady Neko...
Etsuko: ...Eh, I say forget it. The record states that Domeki went missing — well, that's what it says anyway, but if he was hit by that storm, he probably...
Etsuko: We'll continue exploring this island and collecting more information about this incident for a while, and then we'll report back to the Guild.
Etsuko: Who knows? Maybe we'll have the pleasure of working together again some time.
Traveler: I look forward to it.
Etsuko: The feeling's mutual.
Etsuko: Well, Taisuke, let's ready up. We've got some exploring to do.
Taisuke: Uh, so Miss Etsuko, about Lady Neko...
Etsuko: You can keep treating that cat just as you did before, of course.
Etsuko: Just remember to refrain from saying anything you shouldn't.
Etsuko: It's a real happy camper right now. No need for you to be a wet blanket.
Taisuke: I got it. Haha, Miss Etsuko, you really are...
Etsuko: ...Just trying to finish our commissions more efficiently. C'mon, let's get to work.
Etsuko: Seirai Island... It seems that this place is still full of many mysteries...
Traveler: Do you know something?

## Talk 4

Ooshima Junpei: Phew, we're almost done here. This was a big job if I've ever done one...
Ooshima Junpei: Oh, it's you, and the Lady Priestess too.
Neko: How is it? Is the statue complete?
Ooshima Junpei: Yes it is, as you can see, hehe! I actually left a little extra stone here — I was just waiting for the Lady Priestess to return before I chipped it off.
Traveler: That was very thoughtful of you.
Ooshima Junpei: Well, of course. Shrine statues must be treated with the utmost formality, after all.
Neko: Meow meow, is knocking on stone such an important thing?
Ooshima Junpei: Well, how should I say this... Usually, things that we make into statues are all very important.
Traveler: You know, Paimon, you should probably get a statue of food made.
Paimon: Hey! That's rude!
Neko: So... you make statues of good things, you mean?
Ooshima Junpei: Hahaha! Well, I'd say that they're better than just "good"! Statues are what you'd call "memorials to eternity," after all!
Neko: No, no, this isn't some "memorial to eternity."
Neko: I only wish that Hibiki can look upon this statue should she return and be unable to find her way here.
Neko: That way, she will know where to go and not get lost.
Ooshima Junpei: O—Oh, I see. Lady Priestess, you really do care a lot about this "Hibiki," huh.
Traveler: Neko...
Neko: Hibiki will be back any time, after all. Also, she and Domeki said that something good would happen once the stone was complete.
Neko: Well then, stone human. Do you require me to do anything else?
Ooshima Junpei: Well, not really... Well, since you're here, Lady Priestess, I can chisel that last bit of stone off now!
Ooshima Junpei: Three... two... one!
Ooshima Junpei: Wh—What's with this cloud...
Traveler: It turned into the shape of a cat...
Neko: It's Hibiki.
Traveler: Eh?
Ooshima Junpei: Hibiki?
Neko: Meow meow meow! It must've been Hibiki! A good thing happened, just like she said it would!
Neko: It's just like she said, it's just like she told me! A good thing would happen if that stone was completed!
Neko: Wonderful, this is wonderful! What she said was true!
Neko: Yes, she will certainly return!
Ooshima Junpei: Hoo... Hooray! Hahaha, I don't know what's going on exactly, but given how pleased the Lady Priestess looks, this must indeed be a good thing.
Traveler: Neko...
Neko: With your help, the shrine is beautiful again.
Neko: The Offering Box has been repaired.
Neko: The Prayer Rack has been fixed.
Neko: The stone has been built, too! Now, Hibiki will definitely return, won't she?
Neko: And Domeki, Janome, and all of Hibiki's friends, too! They'll come back with her for sure!
Neko: You... you are a good person! Better than that meal! Hibiki will like you for sure!
Neko: I must call all those little rascals together and make plans for her return. And... yes, of course, of course, the many people who will come to visit the shrine. I will need to give instructions concerning that as well...
Neko: And there are all these other matters that must be settled first...
Neko: Oh, Hibiki... meow meow, meow! This is wonderful, wonderful!
Traveler: What in the world...
