# Saurian Versus Mountain


## Talk 1

Tlatem: Come on, don't be discouraged. You just need to get well, and... keep trying! You'll make it to the mountaintop in no time!
Qica: Grooo... Groooo...
Tlatem: Are you hungry? Hmm... Then why don't I get you something to eat?
Qica: Hroo... Oroo...
Traveler: What are you up to?
Tlatem: I'm playing with my buddy Qica. He's still small, but Mom says he'll be the equal of any other Yumkasaurus when he grows up!
Qica: Hroo... Rroooh...
Tlatem: Don't be sad. Your body's just too frail at the moment, and you were injured previously to boot.
Tlatem: Mom says you'll get better for sure. You've just gotta eat well and train with me.
Qica: Rooh? Rrrooh...
Traveler: (Pet Qica.)
Qica: Grooo... Groooo...
Tlatem: Haha. Well, would you look at the time? We've got training coming up soon, so let's get eating!
Tlatem: Mom made these dried fruits, you know! Fried them in a big pot before adding lots of nice-smelling condiments...
Tlatem: Right, and she sprinkled in lots of sugar and petals, too... Either way, it tastes great! Just a moment, I'll give you some...
Tlatem: Wait. Where'd my dried fruits go? I'm sure I put them in my bag...
Qica: ...Hroo, rrooo...
Tlatem: Whoa! Qica! Did you eat it all? C'mon, I've told you not to get greedy... You're gonna have trouble moving around if you eat too much!
Qica: ...Rrooh, oroo...
Traveler: Well, it's good to have an appetite.
Qica: Hroo, rroooh!
Tlatem: Is that so? In that case... I wanna be like Qica. I wanna eat lots, get bigger fast, and help Mom out.
Tlatem: Alright then, Qica! Let's get training!
Qica: Roar!
Tlatem: Let's see... How about we practice mountain climbing today?
Qica: R—Roar...
Tlatem: Oh come on, keep your chin up! We'll do it just like last time. It won't be too hard at all!
Qica: ...Roar!
Tlatem: Right, Uncle Yawar told me last time that we'll have to find a reasonable "training goal" if we're gonna train right...
Tlatem: Now, if only I could find a proper adventurer, and get them to help set some targets...
Traveler: I'm pretty decent as adventurers go...
Tlatem: Really? Uh, then... Would you mind helping me?
Traveler: Need me to take you mountain climbing?
Tlatem: No no, wait. If you're that good, there's no way we'll be able to keep up with you.
Tlatem: So what we'll do is time you while you climb.
Tlatem: Alright then. Climb that mountain as fast as you can. We're counting on you!
Qica: Rawr! Rrooh!
Traveler: Alright then. Follow me, let's get started!
Traveler: Proper adventurer, you say? Look no further.
Traveler: He who eats more grows more.
Traveler: How did he get hurt?
Tlatem: I don't know... but maybe Mom does! Qica was already ill when she brought him in.
Tlatem: He couldn't eat and didn't even have the strength to move. All I could do was dissolve some medicine in water and have him drink it every day.
Tlatem: He recovered in the end, but... his body is still really weak, so he can't scamper all over the cliffsides like the other Yumkasaurs.
Tlatem: That's really upsetting for him, so I'm trying to help him get back into tip-top shape... stronger than any other Yumkasaurus!
Qica: Roar!

## Talk 2

Tlatem: Good boy, good boy! Eaten your fill today? Ready to train?
Qica: Raar, oroo, rrooh!
Tlatem: Pretty energetic today, aren't we? Awesome! Let's do this!
Traveler: Yeah, let's do this!
Tlatem: Huh? Oh, hello there! We're doing some more mountain climbing training right now.
Qica: Rroo! Wrroo!
Qica: Wrooo, rrooh...
Traveler: How's the training coming along?
Tlatem: Well... we're "making progress." Qica's made it up a lot further this time.
Tlatem: It's just that Qica's not very familiar with how you climb mountains, and...
Tlatem: Could you demonstrate for us again, by the way?
Traveler: Sure I can.
Tlatem: Thank you so much! I'm sure I'll be able to catch your movements this time.
Tlatem: You keep your eyes peeled too, alright, Qica?
Qica: Roar!
Tlatem: We're counting on you!
Tlatem: So what we'll do is time you while you climb.
Qica: Hrroo, roooh...
Traveler: Watch closely this time, alright?
Tlatem: Of course! Qica and I won't miss a thing this time!
Traveler: Looks like he's recovering nicely.
Tlatem: That's right. Mom says I'm getting real good at caring for him.
Tlatem: Qica's improved loads. He can climb way higher than he could last time.
Tlatem: It's just that Qica's not very familiar with how you climb mountains, and...

## Talk 3

Tlatem: You're amazing! You're just about as fast as Mayta!
Traveler: H—Heh, it didn't quite go as well as I'd hoped...
Tlatem: Really? You mean you could've been faster still? Wow. Guess you really are an expert adventurer, huh...
Tlatem: If we set this time as our goal... Hmm...
Qica: Hrroo, roooh...
Tlatem: ...Yeah, I know, it's going to be a bit difficult for you, huh?
Tlatem: Guess I'll go show Mayta your climbing time. Maybe he can come up with a more... reasonable training plan for us?
Tlatem: Anyway, thanks a lot for your help. Here, have this Cacahuatl!
Tlatem: We picked it ourselves, so it's super fresh, and it'll make super tasty chocolate!
Qica: Orrooo, orrooo!
Tlatem: In that case, we'll head out now. I wonder if Mayta's back at the settlement. He hasn't gone out climbing again, has he...
Traveler: Who's Mayta?
Tlatem: He's a friend of mine who's real good at mountain climbing. Apart from Big Sis Roca, almost no one's his match.

## Talk 4

Tlatem: Hehe. We're in your capable hands, then! We'll be keeping time for you from here.
Qica: Rawr, Rrooh? Hrroo...

## Talk 5

Tlatem: Wow, you're awesome! I couldn't catch what you were doing at all — you've got to be even faster than Mayta, I bet!
Traveler: I did alright, I think.
Tlatem: I don't think Qica will be able to match your time, though... It's way too fast...
Qica: Hrroo, roooh...
Tlatem: Guess I'll go show Mayta your climbing time. Maybe he can come up with a more... reasonable training plan for us?
Tlatem: Anyway, thanks a lot for your help. Here, have these Cacahuatls!
Tlatem: We picked them ourselves, so they're super fresh, and they'll make super tasty chocolate!
Qica: Orrooo, orrooo!
Tlatem: In that case, we'll head out now. I wonder if Mayta's back at the settlement. He hasn't gone out climbing again, has he...
Traveler: Who's Mayta?
Tlatem: He's a friend of mine who's real good at mountain climbing. Apart from Big Sis Roca, almost no one's his match.
