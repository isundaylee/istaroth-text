# Serenity's Reprise

Xilonen: Ah, you're here. Everything's been taken care of now. I was just about to go have a rest.
Traveler: So what about Tlazolli? Will she be punished?
Xilonen: Well, the tribe is still discussing that. I mean, not many have ever used Ancient Names to commit a crime... Pacal will have a lot on his plate.
Xilonen: What I do know is that Tlazolli's workshop will be closed permanently, and any remaining incomplete Blazegem Inscriptions will be completely destroyed.
Xilonen: As for the completed Blazegem Inscriptions, I'll be handling them, which, yeah, yet another hassle to deal with...
Xilonen: Anyway, at least her Ancient Name is fine, otherwise, we'd have a real mess on our hands...
Xilonen: Oh, and speaking of Ancient Names, I actually have some good news. The memories that were absorbed by the Blazegem Inscriptions can be restored to their owners.
Xilonen: Once all the Blazegem Inscriptions stop working, the memories will return to their respective owners.
Traveler: So everyone's memories of Nechca...
Xilonen: Yeah, that's right. Huh, wait, now that I think about it... In her attempt to get Nechca to come back, Auntie made the entire tribe forget about her.
Xilonen: Now, Nechca really is gone, but everyone is about to remember her... What a bizarre turn of events.
Traveler: How's Nepecha doing?
Xilonen: She's resting in my workshop. I contacted others from the tribe, and told them about my plan to conduct an official investigation into her history.
Xilonen: The tribe hasn't responded yet, so I'm planning to take her in for now, and teach her some crafting skills.
Xilonen: But that's for another time. For now, she should just rest and sleep.
Xilonen: After all, she's got a busy future ahead of her.
Traveler: Will all come back?
