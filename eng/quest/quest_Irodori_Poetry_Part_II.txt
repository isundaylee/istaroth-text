# Irodori Poetry: Part II


## Talk 1

Ootomo: I've heard that flying as free as the wind is the dream of all people from Mondstadt. Honestly, I'd say that this phrase suits Lenne very well indeed.
Lenne: It's just a shame that I didn't enjoy going out as a child. If I had a companion like you then, I might actually have a gliding license now.

## Talk 2

Ootomo: #{F#Miss}{M#Mister}, wonderful timing! Lenne and I were just working on a new poem.
Traveler: Need my help in getting some inspiration again?
Lenne: Haha, that's right. Under Ootomo's instruction, I've been composing another poem with an Inazuman style, although admittedly I'm still quite the amateur.
Lenne: The theme of this poem is "friendship," and indeed both of us can only lament that we did not meet sooner. One of the lines I would like to write depicts animals wandering the landscape in companionship with one another.
Lenne: Since this is an Inazuman poem, we must reference *creatures unique to these lands*.
Paimon: We do see animals unique to Inazuma pretty often â€” whether it be ones that walk or fly...
Paimon: #But since they all appear out in the wild, let's head out and search for them, Traveler.
Lenne: I am in your debt! Please help me take *4* photos of different animals from Inazuma, then.

## Talk 3

Lenne: Do you have the pictures ready, friend?
Traveler: Here they are.
Lenne: Let me see... Oh, these are great! I think I know what to write now.
Lenne: I have written a few more versions of a stanza based on the pictures that you brought. Why don't you pick the one we should use once again?

## Talk 4

Ootomo: I've heard that crossing rivers and seas takes a great deal of time. But if I had a friend with me, I'm sure it would be a glad time.

## Talk 5

Lenne: Friend, since both you and Ootomo love this phrase so, then let us use it.
Ootomo: Lenne's poem and the pictures complement each other a lot. Honestly, the poem just gets more and more moving as you read it and look at the images.
Ootomo: To be honest, I have also been writing a poem for which I might need your aid tomorrow.
Traveler: Do you need me to take some pictures, too?
Ootomo: Heh, let's talk about it in more detail tomorrow.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Ootomo: Hehe, if Lenne and I had met when we were younger, we might have gone on romps outdoors just like those crabs and lizards.

### Additional Talk 2

Ootomo: Inazuman children often gather together to tell tales of youkai to test each others' courage. These experiences also become precious memories when they have grown up.
Ootomo: I didn't expect that Lenne would be able to connect that to the pictures of these creatures. This stanza has deep meaning indeed.

### Additional Talk 3

Lenne: Do you have the pictures ready, friend?
Traveler: Not yet...
Lenne: No worries. We just need *4 pictures of Inazuman animals* today. Thanks a lot!
