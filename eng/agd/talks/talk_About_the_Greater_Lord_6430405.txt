Traveler: About the Greater Lord...
Keon: The Greater Lord may be gone, but the people of Sumeru will never forget the blessings she bestowed upon us.
Keon: Youngster, I'm sure you know that every blade of grass and leaf in this land is a blessing from the Greater Lord.
Keon: *sigh* Human life is too short. Will I be alive to see the Dendro Archon bring Sumeru back to its former glory?
