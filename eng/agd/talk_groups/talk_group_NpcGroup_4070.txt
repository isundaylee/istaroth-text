Traveler: Tell me about yourself...
Effendi: I am the liaison officer sent by the Akademiya to the Citadel of Regzar.
Effendi: The Citadel of Regzar is the gathering place of the Corps of Thirty. Many of the Eremites come and go every day.
Effendi: But I mainly communicate with the Parchamdar and the logistics officer.
Effendi: The Parchamdar used to be a researcher, and the logistics officer is friendly too. Overall, everyone is communicative and it's made my job much easier.
Effendi: But the people of the Corps of Thirty are still too occupied by the commissions from the Akademiya, so I will post part of the commissions to the public.
Effendi: The logistics officer, Yunus, is also greatly in favor of this practice, and is willing to allocate a portion of their military supplies as payment.
