Traveler: What about ores in Natlan?

## Talk

Alom: Sorry, I haven't heard of any good mining outcrops lately. Perhaps they've all been mined already.
Alom: Tell you what, come find me another time. If I hear of anything, I'll be sure to share it with you.

## Talk

Alom: Two, four, five... Oh, looks like I missed the beat again.

## Talk

Traveler: I'd like to buy a weapon.
Alom: Please, go ahead.

## Talk

Traveler: I'd like something made.
Alom: What do you need? Let me see if I can make a sturdier one for you.

## Talk

Traveler: *I'd like something made.*
Alom: Your previous order is complete. Do you have any other requests?

## Talk

Traveler: What beat?
Alom: Oh, don't mind me. I'm just playing some intense music in my head â€” the kind that's perfect for forging.
Alom: I'm guessing you can't hear it? It's a pity that I'm tone-deaf as well, or I'd try singing it for you.
Alom: But feel free to stand by and listen to the rhythm of my ironworking. Just think of it as a form of street music.

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry to bother you.
Alom: Take care.

## Talk

Traveler: *I'd like to buy some weapons.*
Alom: Sure thing.

## Talk

Traveler: That's quite the rhythm.
Alom: I'm not sure why, but this kind of rhythm helps relieve my fatigue from all the repetitive toil. Really keeps my energy levels up, you know?
Alom: Yeah, stone can sometimes serve as a musical instrument.
