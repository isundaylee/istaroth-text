Eymen: Hello, welcome to Djafar Tavern. Come in.

## Talk

Traveler: About Djafar Tavern...
Eymen: Djafar Tavern is always the right place for dining in Port Ormos.
Eymen: We offer the best wine, best food, and best service, all under this roof.
Eymen: You're family when you're here, regardless of where you're from!

## Talk

Traveler: It's been a while.
Eymen: Hey, if it isn't my old customer!
Eymen: The truth is I was a traveling merchant in the desert before making enough money to start this establishment.
Eymen: Life was rough in the desert. The Eremites actually looked after me there, and that's why I helped those outlaws.
Eymen: But now I have nothing to do with them. You'll forgive me, right?

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Eymen: Feel free to come back for some good wine anytime!

## Talk

Traveler: Anything else?
Eymen: And... And... I just managed to collect some "fine wine" every now and then for the business of the restaurant.
Eymen: Would you like to take some wine? Please take some, it's my sincere apology for what I did before.
Eymen: No wine? Then... Oh, I have this good sword given by an Eremite member. You can take that.
Eymen: Port Ormos is packed with people from all walks of life, you don't want to hang around here unguarded.
