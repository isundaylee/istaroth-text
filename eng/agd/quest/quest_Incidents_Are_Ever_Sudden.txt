# Incidents Are Ever Sudden


## Talk 1

Temach: #Welcome... Hmm, it looks like one of you has already mastered the skill of flying. So, is this the young man who wants to learn how to fly?
Traveler: I already have a gliding license.
Temach: Gliding license? First time I've heard of that.
Temach: Here, we aim to have Saurian and rider stride toward improvement together. Your partner...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rrah, rawr!
Temach: ...Hmm, sorry, little guy, but I doubt Pakpaka Flying School is the place for you to show off your skills. Not your fault, though, so don't take it personally.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr?
Traveler: #{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} is still young, and still has lots of potential to unlock.
Paimon: There's no way a Tepetlisaurus's potential for flight can match that of a Qucusaurus or Iktomisaurus!
Temach: #Either way, young man, if you're interested in our flying training, I recommend that you try our training course!
Temach: You'll need to be able to dodge obstacles and turn with agility to ride a Qucusaurus. You'll know just how good you are after trying the training course!
Temach: To be honest, we've worked really hard to promote it. We've got the prizes prepared, races organized, the works. If you pass, go to Lamizana to claim your prize.
Traveler: What can you teach me?

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'll give it a try.

## Talk 3

Lamizana: As your senior, your older brother, even, let me teach you how to fit in and become popular.
Taruka: Thanks, but that's not necessary. And you're not my older brother, either...
Taruka: By the way, can you stop giving Oberon crackers?
Oberon: Coooo.... Guguuuu...
Lamizana: Hey, listen here, you little brat, if it wasn't for your sister...
Traveler: Excuse me, I'm here to claim a prize.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Raaaawr!
Lamizana: Oh, a rare guest. We don't see small Tepetlisaurs every day here. And combined with this... Well, you sure have quite a few different breeds of companions, don't you?
Paimon: #Breeds...!? Paimon and {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} aren't even remotely the same thing!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Hroowr? Wrooo...
Paimon: #Huh? No, well, we're both Traveler's companions, sure, but we're not entirely the same. Paimon isn't saying that either of us is better or worse, so don't be sad.
Traveler: The truth hurts the most when it just slips out...
Paimon: #Hey, you know that's not what Paimon's saying, so don't try to make things more complicated. {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} is a great buddy of ours!
Traveler: #You're also a great companion, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Hroo? Rawr!
Paimon: #Hehe, Paimon knew you'd get it, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}!
Lamizana: Wow, that's actually some pretty impressive rapport. Your clothes scream that you're not locals, yet the trust and friendship between you and this Tepetlisaurus runs deep. What's your secret?
Lamizana: I mean, I won't sugarcoat it. Taruka and his Qucusaurus are partners, but they don't get along very well. If you really do know a secret, I'd love for him to learn it.
Taruka: Instead of picking on me, why don't we talk about... Where their prizes are? Don't tell me they aren't ready yet.
Lamizana: Of course they're ready! Just as ready as you are to change the subject, in fact. Which is something I'll have to talk to you about later...
Lamizana: We'll be holding an air race soon. If you're interested, don't miss out on this chance to watch it and my wonderful performance! I've got stuff to do and places to be now, though, so I'll be on my way.

## Talk 4

Taruka: How many Saurus Crackers did that Lamizana feed you...
Oberon: Croooo!

## Talk 5

Paimon: It was so easy to get these rewards... Paimon wishes that the Adventurers' Guild's commissions were all as easy as this!
Taruka: #Mr. Traveler, are you adventurers?
Traveler: I have an Adventurer Handbook, but Paimon doesn't.
Paimon: #Hmph! Paimon can be an adventurer at heart without something like that, just like how she's just as skilled as Traveler at flying, license or no!
Paimon: Are you asking because you have a commission for us? Wait, don't tell Paimon yet — let her guess first. There's only one answer—
Paimon: #You must have seen how close {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} is to us, and you wanna ask us about our secret to getting along so well! Is Paimon right or is she right?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Raaaawr!
Taruka: Uh, not even close.
Paimon: Huh? But Lamizana said...
Taruka: He's the one with a problem. He's really good at winning people over. Even Oberon listens to him now that he fed him a bunch of Saurus Crackers.
Oberon: Crooo, Cooooo...
Taruka: Stop acting like you're the one who's been wronged. A top-notch Qucusaurus must follow a strict diet. What's more, you're the type who packs on the pounds easily.
Taruka: That guy must have an ulterior motive for fawning over my sister Lliwa time and again... I don't understand why she isn't wary of him at all. They even talk and laugh together!
Paimon: Huh? Sounds like he's a nice guy. Are you biased because you don't like him?
Taruka: No, there's more to it than that. He's been really secretive recently, and I don't know what he's been doing...
Traveler: Adults always have things to do.
Paimon: Yes, didn't he mention an air race? Maybe he's been busy organizing that?
Traveler: He mentioned an air race that was being organized...
Taruka: But he hasn't put all that much effort into this. All the prep and hard work's been done by Paran. The way he's running all over with Carrewoof this whole time, it's easy to tell who is doing the heavy lifting.
Taruka: I overheard something yesterday too! He was discussing dangerous stuff with some outsider on the sly. I didn't dare to get too close, so I didn't hear everything, but...
Taruka: I heard "Be on time on the day of the race," "Don't go too far," "lives," "I'll pay the other half after you succeed," and "We'll discuss the details at the north camp tomorrow night"...
Traveler: Why is it that you only heard the second half so clearly?
Taruka: It's all thanks to Oberon. He was particularly restless at that time and trying to go off to see Lamizana. In the end, I just couldn't stop him...
Oberon: Croooo!
Taruka: That's not praise, you ninny. Anyway, the other person left quickly after seeing me chasing Oberon. Lamizana also acted pretty unnaturally after that.
Taruka: He must have tried to pick a fight with me today because he was worried that he might be exposed. He just wants to give himself a good excuse to keep a close eye on me...
Paimon: Whoa. For a kid, you sure think about complicated things.
Taruka: I get it. You don't trust the words of a child either, right?
Taruka: #But that's exactly why I want to ask Mr. Traveler to investigate the north camp with me at night... Y'know, just in case he really is plotting something dangerous...
Taruka: #In which case, we've gotta put a stop to it! With him here as my witness, the others will definitely believe me... and Lliwa too!
Taruka: #Mr. Traveler, if you think all this is just a kid's overactive imagination, and don't want to go yourself, then at least help me deliver a message.
Taruka: I've written a short letter explaining the situation. If I don't come back by tomorrow, please deliver it to Lliwa. I'll also entrust Oberon to her care...
Paimon: Wait a minute! You're sounding more and more ominous. Things can't possibly be that serious, right... Hmm, wait, what if they are...
Paimon: #Traveler, why don't we investigate? Paimon's gonna have nightmares if something really does happen after we ignore this!
Taruka: You're willing to help me? Hooray! In that case, let's go together tonight...
Traveler: Just leave it to us. You should stay here.
Paimon: Yeah! More people aren't necessarily better in an investigation. You should stay here and wait for news from us. Paimon's an experienced adventurer too, y'know!
Taruka: Well... you do have a point. I'll stay here and take care of Oberon, then. I also need to persuade Lliwa to keep her distance from Lamizana...
Taruka: So I'm counting on you!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Temach: Just need to pass through that circle... Through that circle...
Temach: The training course should be simple enough now, right? Wh—What, you're saying it needs to be even simpler? You mean it's best if everyone can participate and pass?

### Additional Talk 2

Unknown Role (None): We'll be back later.

### Additional Talk 3

Temach: Congratulations on completing the challenge! You can claim your prize from Lamizana. He's nearby in some conspicuous place.

### Additional Talk 4

Lamizana: Don't touch it — this is a prize. If you're interested in our prizes, please complete the training course that Temach's prepared.

### Additional Talk 5

Lamizana: Heh, you should really do something about your bad temper. I'm saying that for your good, alright? You're old enough to learn to be more sensible, for your own sake, even if it isn't for your sister's.
Oberon: Cooo, Croooo.
Lamizana: See? It agrees with me.
Taruka: Even if one of us had to lack sense, that person wouldn't be me.
Lamizana: Hey! You brat...

### Additional Talk 6

Paran: Sorry, Ms. Quilla. Carrewoof didn't hurt you, did he? He isn't usually nearly that enthusiastic towards strangers.
Quilla: Haha, I'm fine. I love interacting with animals. If anything, the affection makes me happy.
Quilla: By the way, Hawka misses you a lot. When he heard that I would be coming here soon, he had me ask about how you've been doing.
Paran: ...Uncle Hawka? Why would he care about me? Ugh, I'm sorry, we've had some clashes, but they aren't worth mentioning...

### Additional Talk 7

Lliwa: How troublesome...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Lliwa: Well, I have a little brother who's a lot younger than me. Maybe he's just in his rebellious years, but he doesn't get along with anyone...
Lliwa: Bah, I'll only add to your troubles by telling you about this. Things will probably get better when he grows up!
Traveler: Sorry to bother you.
Lliwa: It's no trouble. See you around.

### Additional Talk 8

Carrewoof: *whimper*...

### Additional Talk 9

Cisik: Want to try out the training course?

### Additional Talk 10

Temach: We still have a few more flying challenges. Details are written on the board. Give 'em a try if you're keen... Of course, there are prizes to be won.
Traveler: About the Pakpaka Flying School...
Temach: Honestly, I have no clue why it's called that. But speaking of Pakpaka... Have you ever heard the story of Kuntur and the evil sorcerer Rumi?
Temach: The warriors of the tribe were defeated by that wicked mage, and he turned them into Pakpaka... which doesn't sound all that good. Maybe Pakpakas fly very quickly, or something — I don't know.
Traveler: About Lamizana...
Temach: Haha... He's a good fighter, but not necessarily a good teacher. And as an opponent in flying competitions... I guess he's passable?
Temach: But I mean, why would you come here if you didn't have issues with flying? So, if I were to be too strict... *sigh* Well, it's not like things like this have never happened in the past.
Temach: That's why I focus on encouraging people nowadays. I'm sure that approach will get results just fine too.
Traveler: Gotta go.
Temach: See you. You're welcome back any time.

### Additional Talk 11

Cisik: Welcome to Pakpaka Flying School!
Traveler: What do you do here?
Cisik: We give all cadets the necessary guidance and help they need. Things have changed a lot, you know. Back in the day, students couldn't expect that kind of tender loving care.
Cisik: But then there was this one time when the coach was a little... strict with their words, and the student in question just happened to have quite a temper... *sigh* Yeah, that's not a fun one to talk about.
Cisik: Anyway, our teaching policy's been shaken up since then. And I mean, nobody slaps a smiling face, and nobody hates compliments, am I right?
Traveler: I'll be off, then.
Cisik: Here's to a pleasant day!
