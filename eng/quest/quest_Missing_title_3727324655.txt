# Missing title (3727324655)


## Talk 1

Berrypuff: Blub...
Paimon: #Its friends aren't trapped like last time, right? {NICKNAME}, let's go over and check it out!

## Talk 2

Berrypuff: Blub...
Paimon: This should be the "Berrypuff" that was mentioned in the note. Poor thing, it looks pale and haggard...
Paimon: Ugh, did that engineer really believe their calculations were correct? The food has already run out!
Paimon: #Maybe the Fontaine Research Institute blew up because it's full of people like this... Anyway, {NICKNAME}, let's give it some food!
Paimon: What do Blubberbeasts eat though? Hmmm... if there's some fish...
Traveler: But this area should be teeming with fish...
Paimon: Hmmm, it could be that it's too weak to catch up to the fish... So let's try feeding it the stuff we've got instead, shall we?

## Talk 3

Berrypuff: (The helpless little Blubberbeast gazes at you with vigilance, though it has no more strength to run away.)

## Talk 4

Black Screen Text: The Blubberbeast sniffs at the food in your hands tentatively while glancing at you warily. It does not sense malicious intent from you, and cautiously takes a bite...
...Though it was slightly hesitant at first, it quickly becomes ravenous, wolfing down all the food you hand to it. Seems like it has been starving for quite some time...
Black Screen Text: After a while, the Blubberbeast regains its stamina and barks twice at you before clapping its belly, seemingly its way of offering thanks to a stranger...
Berrypuff: Blub blub...
Paimon: Heehee, it looks very happy and it's not that scared of us anymore!
Paimon: Yes, yes, eat to your heart's content, then you'll recover!
Paimon: #Although... Paimon doesn't think we can just leave it alone... {NICKNAME}, how about we come back and check on this Blubberbeast every now and then?

## Talk 5

Berrypuff: Blub blub!
Paimon: Heehee, Berrypuff seems to be able to recognize us now!
Paimon: That's right! It's us again! We brought you food too!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, let's feed Berrypuff something delicious just like last time, shall we?
Berrypuff: (For some reason, the Blubberbeast doesn't seem to be paying attention to you...)

## Talk 6

Berrypuff: (For some reason, the Blubberbeast doesn't seem to be paying attention to you...)

## Talk 7

Berrypuff: ♪~
Paimon: #Heehee, it looks very happy! Well then, {NICKNAME}, let's give it some food!

## Talk 8

Black Screen Text: This time, the Blubberbeast sniffs the food you hand over inquiringly, before swallowing it in one gulp, happily clapping its stomach afterward.
Black Screen Text: The Blubberbeast circles you a few times as if in thanks and then turns around. Through the partition of crystalline transparence, it joins its kindred in something akin to a song, their voices joyous...
Paimon: Yeah, that should do it!
Paimon: #It seems like it's having a lot of fun with its own kind! {NICKNAME}, maybe we should leave them be for now.

## Talk 9

Berrypuff: (The Blubberbeast looks anxious and keeps staring at a particular direction...)

## Talk 10

Paimon: Hmph? Strange, it still looks like it has no appetite...
Paimon: Its friend that was trapped by the seagrass is over there, so it shouldn't have anything to worry about, right? ...Maybe it's sick?
Traveler: There might be something troubling it on the other side...
Paimon: Huh? Other side?
Paimon: #Hm... We can't see it from over here. {NICKNAME}, how about we go over and take a look?

## Talk 11

Paimon: Ahhh, so this is where it was hiding!
Berrypuff: Blub blub...
Paimon: #Don't be afraid. It's us! {NICKNAME}, let's feed Berrypuff, just like we did before!

## Talk 12

Berrypuff: Blub?
Paimon: Berrypuff doesn't seem to be scared now. Is it because it can sense there's no danger now?
Paimon: #Good. Let's give it some food, {NICKNAME}!

## Talk 13

Black Screen Text: The Blubberbeast sniffs the food you offer and scarfs it down without hesitation before affectionately licking your hand.
It then swims to one side and begins a joyous chorus with its friend through the glass...
Paimon: Heehee, it is getting close with us!
Paimon: You gotta get better soon! Once you fully recover, you can go back to the sea and play with your own kind again!

## Talk 14

Berrypuff: (The Blubberbeast gently bites your sleeve and looks very anxious and upset. Seems as if it is trying to pull you to a certain direction...)

## Talk 15

Paimon: I—It's not eating at all...
Traveler: It keeps looking over at that direction...
Paimon: Huh? That direction?
Paimon: Whoa! Paimon can't see what's going on back there clearly...
Paimon: Strange... Berrypuff's friend is usually here, but it hasn't shown up at all today.
Paimon: Paimon thinks she heard that Blubberbeasts can communicate using songs we can't hear...
Paimon: #Oh no, could it be trapped in the seagrass over there like last time? {NICKNAME}, let's go over and check it out!

## Talk 16

Paimon: Ohh, so it lost its appetite because it was worried about its friend!
Paimon: But why would there be this many clockwork meka around here? And they're even attacking innocent animals... Shouldn't the Fontaine Research Institute do something about all this?
Paimon: #Anyway, {NICKNAME}, let's give it the food we prepared!
Berrypuff: ♪~
Paimon: It seems to be in much better spirits than last time! It should make a full recovery soon and return to the sea with its companion!

## Talk 17

Black Screen Text: You offer some food and Berrypuff quickly swims out and unhesitatingly devours the treat.
You tentatively reach out a hand to pet the little Blubberbeast. It feels softer and warmer than you expected, almost as if you're running your hands across a plush toy made from velvet.
Paimon: Hehe! It trusts us completely now!
Paimon: Looks like the Blubberbeast will grow up very soon! Oh, Paimon can't wait!
Paimon: #Why don't we come back to visit it again later, {NICKNAME}?

## Talk 18

Paimon: Huh? Berrypuff seems a bit uneasy... Maybe it's hungry?
Paimon: #Let's feed it some food, {NICKNAME}!
Berrypuff: Blub blub...!

## Talk 19

Paimon: Whoa, it's gotten so big! Maybe we should start calling it Berrypuffier!
Paimon: And it looks really healthy too, all thanks to our hard work feeding it!
Berrypuffier: Blub blub!
Paimon: Hmm, if that is the case, perhaps we should send it back to the sea? It is its home, after all.
Berrypuffier: Blub...?
Berrypuffier: (The Blubberbeast seems to understand your intention and looks a bit hesitant...)
Paimon: Hmm? Doesn't it want to leave?
Paimon: Well, Paimon understands. This place must already feel like home.
Berrypuffier: Blub...
Paimon: Heehee, it's okay! Though the sea is a vast place, you can come back anytime you want!
Berrypuffier: ...
Black Screen Text: You take the Blubberbeast outside...

## Talk 20

Berrypuffier: Blub... blub...
Paimon: Hmm? It's looking at the direction of the aquarium, no? Doesn't want to leave, huh?
Berrypuffier: Blub... blub!
Paimon: Wait, it doesn't seem to mean that...
Paimon: Oh! Its old friend is here!
Paimon: Even though you've grown up, you should still have fun with your friends!
Paimon: Goodbye, Berrypuff. Take good care of yourself!
Black Screen Text: The grown-up Blubberbeast seems a little reluctant to leave. It comes to you and gently rubs your cheek, as if saying goodbye. Before swimming away, it seems to remember something. It bows its head, bites your sleeve lightly, then raises its head again, and barks softly in the direction of the aquarium twice...

## Talk 21

Berrypuff: ...Blub?
Traveler: (Instruct the Blubberbeast to somersault.)
Berrypuff: (Berrypuff gazes at you with a confused look and pats its belly a couple of times. Seems it does not understand what you want...)
Paimon: Hmm... Seems like Berrypuff can't grasp such a kind of movement for now, but it might be able to learn once it's grown a bit more!
Traveler: (Feed the Blubberbeast.)
Berrypuff: (Berrypuff takes a few sniffs of your food but does not eat it. Instead, it turns away...)
Paimon: #We just fed it a while ago. It is probably not hungry now. Let's come back later, {NICKNAME}.

## Talk 22

Berrypuff: ♪~
Paimon: Heehee, looks like you're really happy. If you recover soon, you'll be able to go out and play with your friend!
Paimon: Alright, Paimon thinks it's full already. Let's come back later.
Paimon: #Hmmm... Seeing Berrypuff eat is making Paimon hungry... {NICKNAME}, let's get Paimon some food, too!

## Talk 23

Berrypuff: ♪~
Paimon: Heehee, it seems really happy to be with its friend!
Paimon: Alright, Paimon thinks it's full already. Let's come back later.

## Talk 24

Berrypuff: Blub?
Traveler: (Instruct Berrypuff to somersault.)
Paimon: Whoa! Berrypuff can pull off such complicated movements now!
Paimon: Hehe, our effort sure paid off! Now Berrypuff should be just fine after it returns to the sea!
Traveler: (Feed Berrypuff fish.)
Berrypuff: (Berrypuff sniffs your food and bows its head gently to rub it against your hand, but it doesn't seem to be hungry...)
Paimon: #We just fed it a while ago. It is probably not hungry now. Let's come back later, {NICKNAME}.

## Talk 25

Berrypuff: Blub...
Paimon: #Looks like Berrypuff is concerned about what's happening over there... Let's go and check it out, {NICKNAME}!

## Talk 26

Paimon: #Hm? {NICKNAME}, look over there. It looks like someone left some notes...
Engineer's Notes: "...During the observation of maritime creatures, a Blubberbeast pup was rescued from a ray-style clockwork meka that lost control..."
Engineer's Notes: "...Basic biological tests were conducted... Turned out it is much weaker than regular Blubberbeasts. If it is returned to its original habitat, the estimated chance of survival would be no more than 20%..."
Engineer's Notes: "...A conclusion has been made. The Blubberbeast will be kept and taken care of in the observatory station. If it can grow up healthily, its estimated chance of survival will be increased to approximately 70%..."
Engineer's Notes: "...After giving it some thought, I decided to name it 'Berrypuff.' Though it doesn't resemble berries in any way, it looked really happy when I gave it one, so Berrypuff it is."
Traveler: (Turn page.)
Engineer's Notes: "...The research funds have been withdrawn by the supervisor, who said that the funds will be re-purposed for something like 'An Innovative Circuit Design Using Clockwork Meka to Simulate the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game and Its Sociological Impact'..."
Engineer's Notes: "...Even such nonsense can be approved. What are those people even thinking..."
Engineer's Notes: "...I should've gone to Sumeru and joined the Amurta there... These guys should just become mechanisms themselves if they care about those so much!"
Engineer's Notes: "...I have no choice but to go back first... But I can't find a way to take Berrypuff with me... It can't adapt to the environment on land. I have to leave it here..."
Engineer's Notes: "If my calculations are correct, the rest of the food should be enough to last Berrypuff and allow it to grow up healthily..."
Paimon: Hmm, the handwriting looks pretty new...
Paimon: #Paimon can't stop wondering if the Blubberbeast in the note is doing alright... {NICKNAME}, shall we go in and check it out?

## Talk 28

Berrypuff: Blub...
Paimon: #Looks like it is concerned about what's happening over there... Let's go and check it out, {NICKNAME}!

## Talk 29

Paimon: Huh? Why aren't you eating anymore...
Traveler: Maybe it's already full?
Paimon: Hmm, but Berrypuff doesn't look that energetic? If it already ate, it should be more active, right?
Paimon: Hey, speaking about not being picky, it seems to be looking in that direction...
Berrypuff: Blub... blub!!!
Unknown NPC (): Blub...
Paimon: Ahhh! There is another Blubberbeast trapped by waterweeds!
Paimon: #So that's why it's been acting weirdly. It's too worried about its partner to eat! {NICKNAME}, let's cut off the waterweeds and set its friend free!
Traveler: Maybe it doesn't like this kind of food?
Paimon: No, that won't work! Being picky is bad! Well, Paimon wants to say that, but Berrypuff really looks pretty tired, so maybe pickiness is not the problem here...
