Traveler: What does a "messenger" do?
"Tilla": Never mind, don't worry about it! This is just a humdrum job that helps people take a load off their minds.
"Tilla": If someone needs help, we help them find it. If someone needs to convey a message, we help them with that too.
"Tilla": This job's no different from being a fisherman, a chef, a sailor, or a porter.
"Tilla": I'd even venture to say that in some ways, being a "messenger" is far more... beneficial to the public good. Hehe.
