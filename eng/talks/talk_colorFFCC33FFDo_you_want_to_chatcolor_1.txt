# Talk Dialog

Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Do you want to chat?</color>
Yoimiya: Sure, you know I love to talk. Let me think, is there anything interesting going on these days...
Yoimiya: Ah, right. You've got such a large piece of paradise here. Do you have any plans for it, you know, besides just living here?
Yoimiya: Ever thought about building a parlor or a show room? Or maybe a training ground?
Traveler: I'd love to do some business like you.
Yoimiya: Whaâ€”? There might have been a slight misunderstanding, you see, my family's business is not the usual kind of business.
Yoimiya: I know merchants in Liyue are really good at making Mora, they're experts at landing deals both big and small.
Yoimiya: However, our family's customers are mostly regulars, so we put most of our focus on those relationships.
Yoimiya: My pops and I, we mainly do business so that we won't let everyone down.
Yoimiya: Anyway, when it's finished, let me know. I'll set off some fireworks to celebrate.
Traveler: What would you build if you were me?
Yoimiya: Me?... Hehe, I'd build a playground!
Yoimiya: With toys everywhere! They'd be flashing, moving, and spinning. Also, tasty snacks for whenever I'm hungry!
Yoimiya: Living in a world like that would be a dream come true!
Traveler: I'll think about it.
Yoimiya: No, no. No need to seriously consider it. It's just a little fantasy of mine.
Yoimiya: But... I'm happy to hear you say that.
Yoimiya: A playground... Ahh, how wonderful.
Traveler: I want to build a garden.
Yoimiya: Wow, good idea! That sounds really interesting. I want to help.
Yoimiya: If you need anything, just tell me. If it can be found in Inazuma, I can get it for you.
Yoimiya: Thanks to the family business, I've got tons of connections. Haha!
Yoimiya: Well, I guess I can't get you the stars, or the moon. But pretty much anything else.
