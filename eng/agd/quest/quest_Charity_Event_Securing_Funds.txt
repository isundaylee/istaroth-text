# Charity Event? Securing Funds?


## Talk 1

Paimon: So, there are a ton of sellers at the Weinlesefest. Should be some pretty cool stuff to check out, right?
Paimon: Let's go and browse while we still have the chance!

## Talk 2

Paimon: That must be Georg. Let's go talk business!

## Talk 3

Barbara: #Traveler, Paimon! You're here!
Paimon: Hey! It's Barbara!
Traveler: Hi, Barbara.
Barbara: Thanks! And happy Weinlesefest to you, too!
Barbara: This festival is one of the most popular ones in Mondstadt. I'm so happy I ran into you guys here. I hope you have a great time!
Barbara: Oh, also, I heard from Georg that you're collecting Fairbrew Jellies?
Barbara: I'm just curious, are you helping out with the Knights of Favonius charity event?
Paimon: We sure are! Everybody's gotta do their part, right?
Paimon: The stall isn't up and running yet. We're busy raising funds so they can open for business!
Paimon: There's sure to be a bunch of other problems to deal with once it's open, but whatever comes up, we'll deal with it!
Barbara: Wonderful! Heehee... they're lucky to have you. Now that you've joined the team, I just know it'll be a huge success!
Traveler: Thanks for your encouragement!
Barbara: I helped out at a small charity sale for the Knights once, too.
Barbara: Although... my only contribution was standing out front and singing...
Barbara: Oh! And I also met the bard, Venti there! He even persuaded me to perform an impromptu song with him...
Barbara: The music he plays is quite refined and elegant. At first, I didn't want to sing too loudly, in case I ruined the style he was going for...
Barbara: But he sang a harmony to guide me in, and before long, we were sounding great.
Barbara: In the end, the audience loved it, and we sold a lot at the event.
Paimon: So Barbara's worked with the Tone-Deaf Bard before...
Traveler: I wish I could have been there to hear it.
Barbara: Yeah... too bad we couldn't fit it into the schedule this year.
Barbara: The Church of Favonius wants to hold a sung poetry event somewhere with a nice view during the festival, which means I have to go to rehearsal...
Traveler: Go do what you have to do, it's alright.
Paimon: Yup, sounds like we've each got our own important work to do. Let's give it our all.
Barbara: Thank you both! Well, maybe I can't stay here and sing, but I still wanna do a little something to contribute!
Barbara: I can, um... I can help promote your stall.
Barbara: Hmm... Should I make some big posters? Or maybe some flyers to hand out?
Barbara: I'll have to pick a memorable slogan, too! And maybe it'll seem more sincere if I sign them...?
Barbara: Then again, maybe telling people in person would be more effective...
Paimon: Wow, with Barbara helping out on the marketing side, this charity event will get loads more attention!
Traveler: Sounds like a lot of effort...
Barbara: It's fine, really! It won't take me too long. Now I feel a little embarrassed, heh...
Barbara: #Let me think about it a little more and talk to some other people about their marketing experience! Traveler, Paimon, I'll see you later~
Barbara: And, um... the Knights and the Church of Favonius are really proud of you!
Paimon: Aww, thanks! We'll do our best.
Paimon: #Paimon's even more motivated than ever now! Traveler, we gotta make sure we do a really great job here!
Traveler: You have so much on your plate already.
Traveler: We'll take care of the charity event.
Traveler: Happy Weinlesefest!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Georg: I'm sorry â€” Did you even speak to Shevirme before deciding on a price? You must be joking, that's much too low.

### Additional Talk 2

Georg: Look, I know we've had a great harvest this year and our production costs have gone down a fair amount, but even then... I'm afraid this price is just not doable.

### Additional Talk 3

Georg: Sounds good to me, that's around the same price we've agreed in previous years, too. We have a deal!

### Additional Talk 4

Georg: Hmm... A little lower than I was hoping for. But he's a reliable customer. I think I can make it work.

### Additional Talk 5

Georg: I'm sorry, but I just can't consider going that low. If you're serious about placing an order, please, just take my price.

### Additional Talk 6

Georg: As usual, I will arrange for someone to deliver the goods directly to Shevirme's place of business.
Georg: You won't have to worry about a thing. Just make sure you keep hold of this receipt.
Paimon: Alright, let's keep bringing the funds in. We gotta work quickly if we wanna gather all these Fairbrew Jellies in time!
Paimon: Bernhard says we can approach this however we want, just as long as we raise all the funds we need...
Paimon: We get a commission for every order we help place for an international customer. So maybe it's not worth trying to sell loads of ingredients to the wine merchants...
Paimon: Still... just to make sure we've covered everything, let's take a look at the other wine merchants.
