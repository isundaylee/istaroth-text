# Talk Dialog

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Rosaria: Sure. But let me make this clear: If you're looking to confess, you should go find someone else.
Traveler: Sounds like there's a story behind that.
Rosaria: Ha... so, I was on duty this one time, receiving confessions from believers.
Rosaria: And, it was hard enough to make sense of their jumbled confessions, but then I had to use useless words like "May the Anemo Archon bless you" to make them feel better.
Rosaria: Ugh. Archons have mercy on me.
Rosaria: However, a lot of people believe that misfortune and suffering will never touch them because they're blessed by Barbatos.
Rosaria: I mean, sure, if this way of thinking makes them happier, then they can keep believing.
Rosaria: Wait... Was it Bartobas? Oâ€”Or was it Barsibato? I feel like I said it wrong again.
Traveler: It's just Barbatos, actually...
Rosaria: Yeah, let's go with that. Barbatos it is.
Rosaria: Um... Also, thanks.
Rosaria: Being able to talk to you so casually without having to worry about being nagged is quite the luxury.
Traveler: I'm not interested in confessionals.
Rosaria: Great. Then we're on the same page.
Rosaria: Instead of wasting your time sobbing and confessing your sins at church, you're better off repenting with concrete actions.
