Mika: Thank you so much for your surveying tips! I had no idea that the Sumeru Forest Watchers would also have expertise in this area... You really do know just about everything!
Tighnari: It's only natural that Forest Watchers and surveyors would have some similar skills. We're both constantly outdoors and on the move, after all.
Tighnari: Anyway, I'm glad I could help.
Mika: If I can find the chance, I'd love to pay a visit to Sumeru as well! I've heard that the terrain is quite complicated there, and it'd be a treat to see it for myself.
Tighnari: Yes, "complicated" is indeed one way to put it. Visitors often get lost when they visit Sumeru for the first time, and they have a tendency to pick all kinds of mushrooms and fruits in the rainforest without discretion.
Mika: Ah, we get a lot of people here picking Philanemo Mushrooms as well...
Tighnari: Actually, have you ever tried adding them to a recipe? They are quite bland by themselves, but perhaps, the taste can be improved if they're cooked together with other ingredients...
Mika: I've never tried that myself... But now that you mention it, I do want to give it a try...
Tighnari: I'm quite curious, too. Would you like to pick some together later?
