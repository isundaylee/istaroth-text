Xi'er: What are you doing?
Xi'er: Oh, hello. You're visiting here, too?
Xi'er: I'm Xi'er, from Chihu Rock in Liyue. My job is eating! Wait, no, there's a word for it... Gourmet! I'm a professional gourmet.
Xi'er: I'm in Mondstadt specially to try the food. Mostly because I heard that Chef Xiangling from Wanmin Restaurant gets some of her ingredients from here.
Xi'er: I like that there's a focus on fresh, quality produce...
Xi'er: But in terms of presentation and seasoning, I gotta say Liyue is a cut above, regardless of whether you're talking about Li or Yue cuisine.
