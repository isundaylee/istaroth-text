## Talk

Asagiri: H-Hello! I'm counting on you to bring my muse back!
Asagiri: If I delay again, I bet Miss Moriko'll... *sob*

## Talk

Asagiri: Thanks for bringing me the pictures. What a lovely place Mondstadt is!
Asagiri: Look at that huge tree... How I wish I could stand in its shade and draw...

## Talk

Asagiri: Thank you. Wow! I've never imagined an inn as big as this one...
Asagiri: To be able to build an inn out in the wild and manage it so well, its owner must be a very capable person...
Asagiri: The panoramic view of the snow mountain is the very definition of perfection!
Asagiri: Awesome! I'm gonna draw a big panoramic picture of it!
Asagiri: Then I'll send a smaller one to Ms. Moriko. She has always loved the sight of snowy mountains.

## Talk

Asagiri: To think you could catch the split second when the lightning stroke â€” you're such a pro.
Asagiri: Well, I'm quite curious about the Great Wolf King of the North...

## Talk

Asagiri: What a most unusual angle... Thank you. Without you, I could've never thought of drawing it this way.
Asagiri: Finally got some ideas for several of my illustrations. Let's hope Miss Moriko isn't in a hurry...

## Talk

Asagiri: Thank you for taking pictures for me. Miss Moriko came by again the other day to check my progress.
Asagiri: Somehow everyone's started writing light novels lately.
Asagiri: I heard that new manuscripts kept coming in at Yae Publishing House and a few rising stars had emerged.
Asagiri: *sigh* I gotta match their spirit. I might make myself a bit more popular if I draw illustrations for a well-written novel.

## Talk

Asagiri: Another busy day of picture-taking, isn't it? Thank you so much.
Asagiri: Speaking of which, I met a writer whom I'd drawn illustrations for.
Asagiri: He says he's writing a novel with the theme of sword fighting and is looking for someone to design the costumes and scenes for him.
Traveler: How do you find his novels?
Asagiri: Hmm... He's an excellent writer. His editor says he's like a poet.
Asagiri: Wonder if he's in the poet mode when writing this novel...

## Talk

Asagiri: What an ingenious idea to take a picture from this angle! It's great!
Asagiri: I do hope Mr. Xavier'll like my posters.
Asagiri: He says he'll use these posters to promote his film.
Asagiri: I can't remember its name. Uh... The story seems to center around a samurai.
Asagiri: Anyway, I hope everything goes well with the shooting.
