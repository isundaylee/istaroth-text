Message Board (Message): I think the answer to the riddle on the left is "Glaze Lily."
Message Board (Reply): But according to the riddle, these flowers were once everywhere... Were there really that many Glaze Lilies?
Message Board (Reply): What about Mint? The poem did say something about the plant being fragrant.
Message Board (Reply): I still think Glaze Lilies fit the description better.
Message Board (Reply): Has anyone solved the riddle on the right? I'm running out of ideas. Wait, could it be something I've never seen before?
Message Board (Reply): I know what it is, but I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to tell...
Message Board (Reply): C'mon, it's just the answer to a riddle!
