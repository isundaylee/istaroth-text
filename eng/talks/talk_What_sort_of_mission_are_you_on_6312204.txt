Traveler: What sort of mission are you on?
Terada: What kind of mission, you ask... What kind of mission do you think it would be, in a place like this?!
Terada: Of course it's... uh, to eradicate evil... and slay all the rebel remnants!
Terada: Yeah, that's all you need to know! You wouldn't understand even if I told you more.
