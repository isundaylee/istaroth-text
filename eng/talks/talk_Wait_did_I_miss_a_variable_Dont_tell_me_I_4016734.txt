Layla: Wait... did I miss a variable? Don't tell me... I have to start from scratch...?
Traveler: Is everything okay, Layla?
Layla: Oh... yep! I'm fine, just kinda feels like I'm seeing stars...
Layla: Gotta get it together! I have to finish this paper before the Festival so I can watch the Parade...
Traveler: The Dendro Archon wouldn't want you to push yourself.
Layla: Yeah... you're right...
Layla: Even the tiniest stars possess their own light. Keep shining, and eventually there will be people who see it... I just need to pick myself up and use another method to run the numbers.
Traveler: The Dendro Archon can already tell how hard you work.
