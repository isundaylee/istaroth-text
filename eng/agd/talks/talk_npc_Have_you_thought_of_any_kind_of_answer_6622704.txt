Traveler: Have you thought of any kind of answer?
Cip: Answers must be preceded by questions, I'm afraid.
Cip: And to be honest, I find that my thoughts have already run off to some distant place before I can ever come up with worthwhile questions.
Cip: Strictly speaking, this defeats the purpose of meditation... which might be why I'm a guard, and not the chief.
Cip: Not that this is a bad thing, I mean. Our tribe's got no shortage of eccentrics, so we can just leave the important duties to them, while I do my own job.
