# The Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival


## Talk 1

Kimura: Oh, do you need a hand with anything?
Traveler: Isn't there supposed to be a festival soon?
Kimura: What? A festival? I haven't heard anything about a festival coming up.
Kimura: Uh, could you be more specific? What festival are you talking about, exactly?
Traveler: It's the Almighty Arataki—
Kimura: Almighty Arataki...?
Traveler: The, um, Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious...
Paimon: It's the Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival, organized by the Arataki Gang!
Kimura: Ah yes! The same Arataki Gang who made a scene at the Irodori Festival?
Kimura: So, you're here for the unauthorized, unprofessional, and unofficial event, huh...
Paimon: What? No, no, no, it's not un-anything! It's the Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival!
Kimura: Yeah, I gotcha, no need to keep re-hashing the name. I think I know what this is about, let me bring you up to speed.
Kimura: So we saw the members of the Arataki Gang here a few days ago. And they were busy at work leaving piles of hideous things all over the place.
Kimura: Their leader claimed to be hosting a grand event, big enough to rival the Irodori Festival. I think that must be the one you're talking about.
Kimura: I asked them a couple of questions and it quickly became clear that they had no permit to host the event, no proof of venue hire, and — surprise, surprise — no record of having registered the event with the Police Station.
Kimura: Pff. If that isn't the definition of an unauthorized, unprofessional, and unofficial festival, I don't know what is. According to the rules, we had to force them to shut down the event.
Paimon: What? You shut it down!? ...Let Paimon guess, then you arrested them, hmm?
Kimura: No, actually. Seeing that they had no prior experience organizing events, and they'd at least gone to the trouble of preparing a safety plan, we just gave them a warning.
Paimon: Safety plan? Huh, that's pretty responsible...
Kimura: Anyway, if you are looking for the Arataki Gang, you could try going to Amakane Island.
Kimura: Which is a venue designated by the Yashiro Commission for use in all kinds of festivals, big and small. It was established to try and encourage community cultural events. The application process is much simpler there, and less expensive, too.
Kimura: We told the Arataki Gang about that.
Kimura: If they still want to host their event, that's gonna be their best option.
Paimon: #Hmm... this whole thing is starting to sound like a non-starter, {NICKNAME}...
Paimon: But, since we've come this far... we might as well go and take a look at Amakane Island, right?
Traveler: The, heh, Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong...

## Talk 2

Kimura: Do you have any other questions?
Kimura: If you want to find the Arataki Gang, try Amakane Island.

## Talk 3

Hirohiko: How can I help?
Traveler: We're looking for the Arataki Gang.
Hirohiko: Ah yes, you must be here for the Almighty Arataki Whatchamacallit Festival, too?
Traveler: "Too"?
Hirohiko: Yep, Madam Kujou Sara of the Tenryou Commission and Yoimiya of Naganohara Fireworks have both been here so far.
Hirohiko: Yoimiya noticed them getting the venue ready when she was here to deliver some fireworks. I guess she got curious and went to go check it out.
Hirohiko: As to what Madam Kujou Sara was here for, I'm not quite sure.
Paimon: #Whoa, so other people got here before us? That's a good sign, {NICKNAME}, hehe.
Paimon: So where's the Arataki Gang now?
Hirohiko: Unfortunately, since there's no space available at any official venues at the moment...
Hirohiko: ...we had to allocate them to a tiny beach at the northwest part of the island.
Hirohiko: If only they'd applied earlier, we could've given them a better location.
Hirohiko: Head northwest, you'll see them.

## Talk 4

Arataki Itto: Hahahahaha! Hey there, compadres! You finally made it!
Arataki Itto: I was just wondering when you'd be showing up, next thing I know, boom. There you are. Hahaha, boy, am I happy to see you.
Arataki Itto: Look at this venue. What do you think? Is this a prime location or what?
Mamoru: It's surrounded by sea, the air is as fresh as it gets, there's no noise pollution from the city, and the views are simply spectacular.
Akira: The venue is situated against the backdrop of Amakane Island, where you can enjoy exclusive access to the Festival and Culture Center's first-rate equipment.
Genta: With excellent transport links by sea and lands, getting where you need to be is highly convenient — whether you're traveling by foot or by boat.
Traveler: This venue is pretty nice.
Arataki Itto: The moment I set eyes on this venue, I knew this was the one!
Arataki Itto: It was the moment that changed the world.
Genta: Give it up for the boss!
Paimon: Clearly, you're only here because the Tenryou Commission sent you away.
Arataki Itto: Ahem... alright, let's get down to business.
Arataki Itto: I invited you all here to attend the Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival! A highly important festival, I might add.
Genta: Yeah, Boss said the first goal of the festival is to promote the Arataki Gang and recruit new members.
Mamoru: Secondly, it's to celebrate Shinobu's graduation!
Akira: And last but not least, it makes up for all the previous team building events that were canceled due to insufficient funding.
Paimon: Three festivals in one, wow.
Arataki Itto: Akira... we can leave that last point out from now on.
Traveler: Where is Shinobu?
Arataki Itto: The thing with festivals is, you gotta get out there and promote them far and wide if you want to get a good crowd. So Shinobu's handing out flyers.
Paimon: Hey! Shinobu's supposed to be the star of the show, isn't she?
Paimon: How come she's out there working her butt off while you're hanging around here doing nothing?
Arataki Itto: Hey, I'm hard at work too! I'm, uh... entertaining guests!
Genta: Boss actually just got back.
Mamoru: He said he was expecting you to arrive any second, so he came back specially to welcome you.
Akira: Until then, he was out there with Shinobu working hard to bring more people to the festival.
Arataki Itto: Just—Just doin' my duty. Nothin' more, nothin' less.
Paimon: Wow, this bull-chucker actually did some serious work for once. Paimon's pleasantly surprised.
Arataki Itto: Hmph, trust a puny little flying Lavender Melon to stoop to the level of childish name-calling!
Arataki Itto: Anyway, so, compadre — you got any questions about this festival?
Traveler: You guys are eternal optimists.

## Talk 5

Genta: I'm Genta, the Arataki Drumalong Festival Welcome Ambassador. Are you ready for your Drumalong performance?
Genta: Oh, I almost forgot, there's something that Boss forgot to mention to you about this hand drum.
Genta: Since none of us really know if it's in tune or not, please test it out first.
Genta: That way, it'll sound better when you deliver your final performance.
Genta: Go on, give it a try.
