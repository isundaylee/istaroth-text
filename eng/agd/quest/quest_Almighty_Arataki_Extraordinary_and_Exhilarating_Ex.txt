# Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl!


## Talk 1

Pain-Grocer: So the rumors of your formidable strength and resilience are true! You are really tough! That was a good fight!
Traveler: Up for another round?
Pain-Grocer: Huh? Are you sure you want to spar with me again? You're so patient!
Pain-Grocer: Well, it's my honor then!
Traveler: About Grandmaster Hanakado...
Pain-Grocer: Why are you asking about Grandmaster Hanakado all of a sudden? You're trying to get some information out from me, aren't you?
Pain-Grocer: Well, I'll tell you what I know. He and I are just business partners anyway, so we're not particularly close.
Paimon: Business partners? But you two are just kids!
Pain-Grocer: So what? I've supplied Tsukumomono Groceries dozens of times. Like the small trees and rocks I pulled out when catching Onikabuto...
Pain-Grocer: The stuff was then made into bonsai trees and rock gardens, and they look pretty impressive when placed in the store! They're sold in limited quantities from time to time, and together with Aoi's promotion, it's pretty good business!
Pain-Grocer: Aoi praised me and said that the goods I delivered are great, and could even be worth a third of many precious treasures!
Pain-Grocer: Grandmaster Hanakado always buys them at high prices, saying that he'll use them to build courtyards and hills in his Onikabuto arena and make a camp for his beetles.
Pain-Grocer: So, by helping you and Grandmaster Hanakado in beetle fighting, I'm also helping Aoi's and my own business venture.
Paimon: Okay, now Paimon understands where that name came from...
Paimon: Anyway, it sounds like Grandmaster Hanakado comes from a very rich family... Could his parents be millionaires in disguise?
Pain-Grocer: I don't know much about that. All I know is that every time he buys my goods, I'll earn enough Mora for a few days' worth of Sakura Shrimp Crackers!
Paimon: Sakura Shrimp Crackers? That's it? Seems like he isn't so rich after all...
Pain-Grocer: Huh? What do you mean? ...You must make a lot of Mora then!
Pain-Grocer: Maybe I'll just hang out with you, and you can pay me to be your beetle-battler!
Pain-Grocer: Then I'll get to beetle-fight with you every day!
Paimon: Money... money isn't that important! Don't get so excited!
Paimon: #Besides... Traveler isn't a beetle fighting professional, so even if you come with us, you won't get too many work opportunities.
Pain-Grocer: Is that so? Forget about it then! Anyway... After my bonsai and rock gardens open for sale, don't forget to pay me a visit and buy something!
Traveler: Until next we meet!
Pain-Grocer: #See you next time, Traveler and Skycleaving White-Iron Lavender Melon! If you don't mind, come and have beetle fights with me again!

## Talk 2

Mamoru: C'mon, Boss, you can't just let this one slide!
Mamoru: You've painstakingly built up a reputation as the "Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King." You can't let that brat get away scot-free!
Akira: Yeah! That little punk must have used some underhanded trick to catch you off guard, I just know it!
Arataki Itto: Hey, hey, chill, boys, chill. Relax!
Arataki Itto: I just underestimated my opponent. And can you blame me, with how boring the kid looked? So yeah, no worries, that fight didn't count!
Arataki Itto: Anyway, enough about that. We're gonna stick to the plan, alright? The "Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl" is going ahead. Then, we'll bring out "Crimson Staff." Y'know, the one I've been training for years!
Arataki Itto: Just imagine it. The whole audience cheering me on as Crimson Staff gets ready to crush its opponent...
Arataki Itto: That kiddo will be trembling with fear. No tricks this time, no sir — just an easy win for Itto! Ahahahahahaha!
Mamoru: Alright, boss, way to go!
Akira: But we don't know when Shinobu's coming back. Where do we even start with organizing the Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl?
Akira: Based on our experience with the Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival, we'll need to register the event with the Tenryou Commission and obtain a permit... and I think we also need proof of a venue rental.
Akira: We're going to need to pay for all of that stuff somehow. If we want the Extreme Brawl to be even more extravagant than the Drumalong Festival, we'll need to spend at least three times the Mora...
Arataki Itto: Stop, stop, stop! We don't say "Tenryou Commission," out loud, okay? It gives me migraines!
Arataki Itto: So we need some funds, huh... Easy — just need to tweak our three-day weekend policy. As well as our one-day week policy. Let's work flat out and do two days on, four days off! That way, we work an extra four days between us, which means we'll earn four times as much. We'll be raking in the Mora!
Akira: Amazing, Boss! Then all we need to figure out is how to make up the numbers for our team! And it doesn't matter who we pick, because you're practically a one-man army!
Mamoru: ...Shoot, that's right! That brat said that he'll be bringing five of his top guys to fight us fair and square. But Boss, you're the only one in our gang who's any good at beetle fighting...
Mamoru: If they come at you in waves, you're gonna have a hard time no matter how good you are!
Arataki Itto: Come on, you two! It's a little early to be getting cold feet. You're thinking too many steps ahead.
Arataki Itto: Where's your Arataki Gang attitude? Come on, I'll find a way to deal with this, easy-peasy lavender-melon-squeezy!
Arataki Itto: Maybe I can hit up my usual beetle-fighting crowd... Or maybe I can visit Naganohara Fireworks and see if I can rope that gal into it...
Arataki Itto: ...Scratch that. If I did that, then news of me losing to that brat would spread around Hanamizaka! Ugh. My reputation would never recover...
Paimon: True! So, Bull-Chucker, what are you up to this time?
Arataki Itto: Gah! You scared me! When'd you get here?
Paimon: Seriously? We've been standing here for ages!
Paimon: We were heading to the Adventurers' Guild, but then we saw you causing a commotion and talking about your next hare-brained event idea...
Traveler: "Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King"?
Arataki Itto: Hey, hey, hey! Don't forget the "Extreme" part. Can't do without the coolest bit of the name, y'know?
Arataki Itto: Compadre, you'll understand my passion for beetle fighting eventually. You just need more practice!
Paimon: Ahh, so you're looking for a way to recover your pride after a humiliating defeat, are you?
Arataki Itto: What? No! Come on, it's not like that! I was ambushed! Ambushed, I'm tellin' ya!
Mamoru: That's right. Some poser calling himself "Grandmaster Hanakado" challenged the Boss in a brief moment of exhaustion after an intense beetle battling session.
Mamoru: He used a ridiculously huge Onikabuto and flipped Boss's beetle over in a matter of seconds.
Mamoru: And then he said something like, "Welcome to the world of real beetle-fighters"...
Arataki Itto: Mamoru, Mamoru! Easy on the details, my dude!
Traveler: I think I understand the situation now...
Arataki Itto: Anyway, compadre, I've heard that you're talented at pretty much everything. You pick up new skills almost instantly, and before you know it, you're a pro...
Paimon: Paimon knows what you're going to say next, Bull-Chucker!
Paimon: You're going to ask us to avenge you and defeat that "Grandmaster Hanakado" for free, aren't you?
Arataki Itto: For free? Flying Lavender Melon, do you really think that I, Arataki Itto, have no code of honor?
Arataki Itto: Listen, compadre. If you do this for me, I'll buy you both lunch for the next two months. One bowl of signature ramen every day for two whole months! How's that sound?
Paimon: One bowl every day? Ooh, now that's an offer worth considering...
Traveler: Why are you being so generous?
Akira: Hahaha! That's the result of Boss's hard-won victory.
Akira: Some little phony was going around calling himself the "Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King," and Boss couldn't put up with that. So Boss challenged him and said whoever wins gets the title.
Akira: After 92 brutal rounds of beetle-battling that lasted one full day and night, the Boss finally emerged victorious!
Traveler: Why do I get the feeling that...
Mamoru: But the kid offered Boss a "One Free Bowl of Ramen Daily" coupon from his family's ramen stall in exchange for giving the title back in two months.
Mamoru: We don't know how good his family's ramen is, but the sheer quantity being offered made it too good to refuse.
Mamoru: Besides, Boss's beetle-fighting techniques are improving so fast that he'll easily have won a more impressive title by two months from now. It's a great deal!
Mamoru: The only slight snag is, we forgot to ask him where the ramen stall is...
Arataki Itto: Ahem! Shh! Shh! Don't sweat the details! Anyway, compadre, Flying Lavender Melon, that's my offer! All that ramen, just for you!
Paimon: Wait! We haven't agreed yet!
Arataki Itto: I've already challenged this "Grandmaster" kid, and he accepted. He's going to bring some reinforcements with him to face off against us.
Arataki Itto: As for the venue, I think I have an idea. But first, compadre, Imma need you to do me a solid and sort out all the pesky paperwork at the Tenryou Commission!
Arataki Itto: Sound good? Good. Alright then, my compadre and melon duo, let's hop to it!
Paimon: Sheesh. Itto sure seems excited about all this. Guess there's no backing out now, huh... We might as well go along with this.
Paimon: We just have to learn how to beetle fight and help him beat his opponents, right? Sounds simple enough!
Traveler: Signature ramen, here we come!
Paimon: Ugh, listen to you! Is Bull-Chucker's childishness really that infectious? Because one Itto is more than enough!
Black Screen Text: After dealing with the Tenryou Commission's pesky paperwork, you head to the venue that Itto mentioned...
Traveler: We'll be pro-nikabutos in no time!
Traveler: ...His opponent simply ran out of patience?
Traveler: Did you finally land a lucrative gig?
Traveler: "Extraordinary and Exhilarating Beetle Battle Brawl"?

## Talk 3

The Cage-Maker: Elyctra... How can I avenge you...
Traveler: Another round with Paimon?
The Cage-Maker: Huh? Are you using me as some kind of free training dummy?
The Cage-Maker: How dare you! You're going down this time!
Traveler: About Grandmaster Hanakado...
The Cage-Maker: Hah! Don't even think about prying Grandmaster Hanakado's secrets out of me!
The Cage-Maker: All you need to know is that Grandmaster Hanakado has the ability to let people see the error of their ways, and enable them to appreciate the beauty of beetle fighting!
Paimon: "Error of their ways"? You sound so melodramatic...
The Cage-Maker: No! At that time, I was obsessed with woodworking, and completely did not consider how to bring the value of my woodworking skills into play.
The Cage-Maker: Then I saw my cousin's second cousin's uncle's childhood friend's nephew, Elyctra really get into beetle fighting. And I tried to stop him...
The Cage-Maker: Luckily, he brought me to see Grandmaster Hanakado. After listening to his speech, I saw how awesome beetle fighting is, and how naive I was!
The Cage-Maker: From then on, I started getting into beetle fighting, and put my lifelong woodworking skills into making insect cages to fully support Elyctra and Grandmaster Hanakado.
The Cage-Maker: Skycleaving White-Iron Lavender Melon, you should also listen to Grandmaster Hanakado's speech, and then work for him!
Paimon: No way! Paimon is scared just hearing you say those things!
Paimon: Don't use such big words. Bull-chuc—, uhh, Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King's words sound so much better!
The Cage-Maker: Ugh, why did I even bother talking to you two? Go then, wallow in your ignorance!
Traveler: Bye!
The Cage-Maker: Off you go!

## Talk 4

Arataki Itto: Not bad! Mamoru and Akira have delivered the goods. Let's start setting this baby up!
Black Screen Text: The highly experienced construction crew builds the arena...
Arataki Itto: Hahahahahaha! Now this is what I call an arena! Lookin' prett-ay good!
Arataki Itto: Boo yeah, compadre! I didn't know you were so handy with this kind of thing!
Arataki Itto: And this awesome poster I made is the cherry on top! It captures the mood perfectly! Ahahahahahaha!
Akira: #Great carpentry, Traveler! And great artwork, Boss!
Paimon: This place seems pretty far from Inazuma City. You sure anyone's gonna show up to watch?
Arataki Itto: You bet they will! When you're as famous as I am, people will flock to watch you!
Arataki Itto: I heard this is the spot where they held the sword-fighting contest during the Irodori Festival. That makes this the ideal venue for Onikabuto duels!
Arataki Itto: Next up, time to show you my invincible Onikabuto, "Crimson Staff."
Paimon: Oh, it really is a red Onikabuto! Amazing!
Traveler: It's as if it's imbued with Pyro...
Paimon: Huh. Paimon didn't expect you to put in this much effort. Where did you find this Onikabuto, anyway?
Paimon: Can Paimon take a closer look?
Arataki Itto: Haha! Go ahead, feast your eyes! But I'm afraid I can't tell you what makes Crimson Staff such a special specimen. That's my little secret!
Paimon: Huh? That smells so familiar, what is that... wait, Valberry Jam?
Arataki Itto: What! You're imagining things! You must be, like, super hungry, or something!
Mamoru: Speaking of which, Boss, you haven't applied a protective coating on top of the war paint yet, right? If it rains, then the 9,000 Mora we spent on the imported jam is gonna go to waste...
Arataki Itto: Don't worry! The "Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl" hasn't started yet. There's still time to give Crimson Staff one last layer of protective coating.
Arataki Itto: Alright, you guys go grab some flyers and start bringing in the crowds. In the meantime, I'll be helping my compadre and Flying Lavender Melon here get up to speed.
Arataki Itto: After that, we'll celebrate over a meal. Ah, so much going on, I've really got my work cut out for me today, whew...
Grandmaster Hanakado: This your venue? Not bad... bigger than I expected.
Akira: It's Grandmaster Hanakado! He's here!
Arataki Itto: Wait, what? You're not supposed to know about this place yet!
Grandmaster Hanakado: Aren't you forgetting something, Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King? We elite beetle fighters can sense each other's presence... or how else would we have crossed paths last time?
Grandmaster Hanakado: Looks to me like you're still busy frantically preparing... is that because you don't have a clue how to beat us?
Arataki Itto: Pff! N—No...! Uh... In case you didn't know, me and my Onikabuto gotta get our brainwaves in sync before a battle, and until we're ready to roll, I always conserve my energy and keep a low profile!
Arataki Itto: I just underestimated the strength of your beetle-battler sixth sense is all!
Paimon: Huh? So that's the kid Itto lost to? Yeah, he does look pretty normal...
Paimon: But the way he talks is pretty unique. It almost feels like... he was born to be Bull-Chucker's archnemesis!
Traveler: Actually, I reckon they get along pretty well...
Arataki Itto: Grandmaster Hanakado! You did well to track me down, I'm impressed. Looks like this Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King needs to watch out for pretenders to the throne.
Arataki Itto: But you're about to regret showing up here uninvited, because you have just earned yourselves a pre-beetle-brawl trouncing!
Grandmaster Hanakado: Good, you seem more confident this time. And it sounds like you actually have a game plan.
Grandmaster Hanakado: But if I crushed you right away, I'd miss out on all the fun... so, I'll let my subordinates play with you first.
Arataki Itto: Hmph! Using your minions to size up the competition now?
Arataki Itto: Then we'll send out Flying Lavender...
Arataki Itto: Ahem! Nope, if Flying Lavender Melon's representing the Arataki Gang, we gotta rise to the occasion! We'll need a better title...
Arataki Itto: Got it, we'll send Skycleaving White-Iron Lavender Melon out to teach you a lesson!
Paimon: Huh!? Why Paimon?
Traveler: Will it be a Speed-Type Paimon?
Akira: Boss! Are we seriously going to fight them right now?
Mamoru: We haven't had time to spread the news about the match yet. Also, your compadre and your compadre's melon haven't even tried beetle fighting before.
Arataki Itto: You make a good point! But the fact is, the kid's here now, and I ain't about to back down! We'll have to put the publicity side of things on hold for now.
Arataki Itto: As for beetle-fighting techniques, I'll be mentoring Flying Lavender Melon... No, no, Skycleaving White-Iron Lavender Melon, from the side! Battling's the best way to learn! Doesn't matter if you lose!
Paimon: Hey! Why are you assuming that Paimon will lose before it's even started?
Arataki Itto: Go, White-Iron Lavender Melon! Show 'em the might of the Arataki Gang!
Arataki Itto: Sending you out first is part of my elaborate strategy, y'know! I got my inspiration from a Liyue tale that Shinobu told me!
Arataki Itto: "Face their strongest with your weakest, their weakest with your average, and their average with your strongest. Then you're guaranteed to win two out of three rounds!"
Arataki Itto: You may be talented, but you lack practical battle experience. With all the elite beetle battlers here, I'm afraid to say you're a small fry.
Arataki Itto: By sending a dopey little melon up first, we can get one of their best fighters to waste all their strength on the low-flying fruit, hahaha! We'll make short work of them this time!
Paimon: Um. But according to your logic, if you're planning to face their leader, Grandmaster Hanakado... doesn't that make YOU our weakest fighter?
Arataki Itto: Huh!? That can't be right...
Arataki Itto: Gah... you little twerp! I never said my strategy was EXACTLY the same as the one in the story!
Paimon: Fine, fine, fine, Paimon'll do it already. But prepare to eat your words, mister!
Paimon: Low-flying fruit, hm? Paimon'll show you!
Traveler: Or a Defense-Type Paimon?
Traveler: We should let them catch up for a bit first...
Traveler: It sure does have a unique aura...

## Talk 5

Grand Rook Sennichi: What the? That Oni is really strong! And he's full of righteous words... How can there be such people in this world?
Traveler: We're here to teach you a lesson!
Grand Rook Sennichi: What's the matter? Don't look down on me! If you can't knock that guy down a peg or two, you're definitely no match for me!
Traveler: About Grandmaster Hanakado...
Grand Rook Sennichi: The Grandmaster? Why do you ask?
Grand Rook Sennichi: You should never mess with him! You can't win him in a debate, and you probably can't defeat him in beetle fighting either.
Paimon: "Probably" can't defeat him? Huh, you're sounding a little less arrogant than before. Looks like Bull-Chucker taught you a little lesson!
Grand Rook Sennichi: How could you say that? I lost to him, fair and square. I would never be that sore loser who refuses to admit defeat!
Grand Rook Sennichi: I, Grand Rook Sennichi, was outshone by the Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King. Even if he wanted me to change my title from "Grand" to "Puny," I'd have no objection at all!
Grand Rook Sennichi: And since you're his friends, maybe you can put the Grandmaster in a tough spot in a way I never thought of...
Paimon: Hehe, that was a very clever thing to say! You don't seem like one of those bone-headed bad guys.
Grand Rook Sennichi: That's what the Grandmaster taught me.
Grand Rook Sennichi: I used to go unnoticed, just a punk who got into fights with other people, looking down on this and that...
Grand Rook Sennichi: The Grandmaster introduced me to this kid's game. He told me that pride and ruthlessness isn't enough. If I can't even win in beetle fighting, it'd mean that I'm less than a child.
Grand Rook Sennichi: So for a long time, I've been using beetle fighting as a way to prove myself.
Grand Rook Sennichi: However, you and the Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King showed up. It made me wonder if I had been a little impetuous, and misunderstood the true meaning behind beetle fighting...
Paimon: Well, you should think long and hard about that! It's one thing to prove yourself, but it's also important to enjoy the game.
Traveler: Goodbye!
Grand Rook Sennichi: Eh... Let's settle this next time!

## Talk 6

Elyctra: What a puny opponent... And what a garish Onikabuto...
Elyctra: Pathetic! You can paint your Onikabuto any color you want... the only thing that counts in battle is their Electro affinity — the source of their power.
Elyctra: Being able to pick out a prize Onikabuto from the crowd is all that matters. That's what makes or breaks every beetle-fighter!
Paimon: That's a strange theory... Even Paimon knows that performance in battle matters the most. Honing your beetle-fighting skills is the most important thing!
Arataki Itto: That's exactly right, mini melon!
Arataki Itto: Nice-sounding theory, but it ain't gonna help you if you don't know how to fight!
Arataki Itto: Listen up, White-Iron Lavender Melon. You need to watch your opponent's Onikabuto closely, so you can dodge its attacks. Then, in the opening right afterward, you strike back!
Arataki Itto: As long as the opponent is in range, Crimson Staff will hit 'em hard!
Paimon: Got it! So when the opponent attacks, we get our Onikabuto to retreat, and when there's an opening, we move it forward and strike while they're still recovering!
Paimon: #Sounds simple enough. Paimon will give it a go! Traveler heard the explanation too, so Paimon bets we're both ready for battle!
Elyctra: Are you seriously learning beetle fighting right before a match? You underestimate who you're up against!
Elyctra: Enough talk. Put your Onikabuto on the table and show me what you've got!

## Talk 7

Paimon: Hehe, piece of cake! You don't mess with this White-Iron Lavender Melon!
Akira (Mamoru and Akira): Amazing, mini melon!
Arataki Itto: Whoa! Who-ho-ho-hoa! Pretty talented, ain'cha? You sure showed them who's boss!
Arataki Itto: You, my little friend, have earned yourself an Egg Roll later today.
Traveler: You're so strong, Paimon!
Elyctra: Ah, "Grandmaster Hanakado," I lost to a complete novice... I have let you down!
Grandmaster Hanakado: Don't worry. It seems that they are a force to be reckoned with... We should inform the other generals to prepare for battle.
Grandmaster Hanakado: You defy my expectations once again, Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King... I didn't expect you to find such formidable warriors so quickly.
Grandmaster Hanakado: From today onward, I will send one of my generals here daily to face you.
Grandmaster Hanakado: Be sure that you survive until the final battle. Otherwise, your declaration of war will become the laughingstock of the entire beetle-fighting world.
Arataki Itto: Wait just a minute. Leaving so soon? What are you, scared?
Arataki Itto: Gah, he's so annoying. Turning up here uninvited, talking to us in that smug tone, then taking off before we're done with him...
Paimon: From what Grandmaster Hanakado said, seems like he's gonna send some of his minions to challenge us. Guess we'll have another battle before too long, huh?
Arataki Itto: That's right. Looks like we won't have time to make the Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl the grandest event ever organized by the Arataki Gang...
Arataki Itto: Meh, works for me! An audience would've been sweet, but at the end of the day, we came here to battle, and battling is what we're gonna do!
Arataki Itto: Look at you, Flying... ahem! Skycleaving White-Iron Lavender Melon... defeating your first powerful enemy, starting to make a name for yourself as a fighter... Really gets me into the fighting spirit!
Arataki Itto: Gets me thinking about myself, back in the day, when I first entered the Hanamizaka beetle-battling scene... taking on the pros for the first time...
Traveler: I'm sure you had your fighting spirit...
Paimon: Ooh, so did you also take down an expert when you first started, Bull-Chucker?
Akira: The Boss got brutally beaten...
Mamoru: I think Boss is saying he was inspired by White-Iron Lavender Melon's performance because he himself was defeated back in the day.
Arataki Itto: C'mon, that's all in the past now! Spilled milk! Water under the bridge!
Arataki Itto: #It's up to the three of us now. Me, the Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King, Paimon, the Skycleaving White-Iron Lavender Melon, and Traveler, the... the Oni King's Right Hand!
Arataki Itto: The three of us have to unite to take down Grandmaster Hanakado and all his minions!
Arataki Itto: Before we face each opponent, we need to talk strategy. As long as we win more matches than we lose, Grandmaster Hanakado will have to face me personally!
Paimon: Bull-Chucker seems to be taking this all pretty seriously...
Paimon: Still, that beetle fight was pretty fun, and we do get two months' worth of free ramen if we help him win this. Let's go along with it and do our best!
Traveler: You still haven't seen me in action.
Arataki Itto: Hahahahahaha! That's what I'm talkin' about! Just follow my lead and give your all in battle. Grandmaster Hanakado's about to get more than he bargained for!
Traveler: I want to show my stuff too.
Traveler: ...But you didn't exactly make a name for yourself back then, did you?
Traveler: Your opponent was weak!

## Talk 8

Wizard Moneybags: Not decisive, nor sharp, nor quick, nor experienced... There's still room for improvement.
Traveler: Wanna try again?
Wizard Moneybags: A rematch, is it?
Wizard Moneybags: Hmm... Yes, this seems worth the effort. Let us begin, then!
Traveler: About Grandmaster Hanakado...
Wizard Moneybags: My benefactor? Sorry, I don't know much about him either.
Wizard Moneybags: I only know that he has a keen eye for Onikabuto.
Wizard Moneybags: When no one else was interested in my Onikabuto Magic Show Troupe, he was the only one who kept coming to my shows. He even memorized the name of every single Onikabuto.
Wizard Moneybags: Though the Mora he gave me was only enough for me to buy two bowls of Unagi Chazuke, he is my biggest and only supporter. I'd help him for free!
Paimon: Oh... So you used to actually train Onikabuto to put on shows? No wonder you used so many fancy words just now...
Paimon: Well, we'll go watch your Onikabuto show once we finish the beetle brawl!
Wizard Moneybags: Haha... I've been barely able to make ends meet for years, so I'm looking for another way out.
Wizard Moneybags: If we are fated, you may hear the name "Wizard Moneybags" again years from now.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Wizard Moneybags: Well, see you later. I need to really think about how I can improve...
