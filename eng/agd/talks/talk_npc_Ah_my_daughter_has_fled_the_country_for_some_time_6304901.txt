Michiru: Ah, my daughter has fled the country for some time now. I wonder how she's doing...
Yoh: Eh, you're going on about that again, are you?
Michiru: How could you say that? I don't even know if she is getting by or not. I wonder if she's alright...
Yoh: Didn't I tell you that someone saw her in Liyue? Just stop talking about it already.
Michiru: I know, I know. But not having seen her in person, I'm still worried...
Yoh: Just relax. She'll be okay. She is our daughter, after all!
Yoh: Our daughter has been independent since she was little. She knows how to take care of herself. She started cooking for herself at the age of seven or eight. Why, by the time she was a teenager, she could already sail out to sea by herself.
Yoh: She enjoys being free and traveling around. She must have been really unhappy at being trapped in Inazuma.
Michiru: But...
Yoh: Trust me, she'll be fine. She is out of the country, living a free and happy life. She's probably made new friends already.
Yoh: She most likely doesn't write letters to us because she doesn't want the government to find out and bring us trouble.
Yoh: Yes, that must be it...
