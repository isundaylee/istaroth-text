# Missing title (458061055)


## Talk 1

Ruu: Are the Maushiro something very important?

## Talk 2

Ruu: You two look so cool while you're fighting!
Paimon: Oh, you're here too, Ruu!
Traveler: Are you alright?
Ruu: I'm fine, don't worry!
Traveler: About those monsters...
Ruu: I don't know where they came from either.
Paimon: They sure don't look native to this place.
Ruu: Mm-hmm. In the past, we didn't have any such monsters on our island. There weren't any furry people or big machines either.
Ruu: In the past, we used to have this native animal we called "Wen Kamuy." They were very gentle... and very delicious, too.
Traveler: Haven't seen those around.
Ruu: I thought so too. I don't know when it happened, but they all seem to have vanished, and these monsters appeared in their place.
Ruu: Maybe they came in from outside the Sea of Fog...
Traveler: There are hilichurls in the outside world too.
Ruu: Isn't that really dangerous?
Traveler: It can be, yes.
Paimon: But adventuring is really fun, too!
Ruu: I'd love to go on adventures, too!
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon's sure that you'll be a wonderful adventurer when you're all grown up!
Ruu: You bet!
Paimon: Leave this perch to us as well. There are monsters about, so you might be in danger if you just run around like that.
Traveler: Leave this to us.
Traveler: Adventuring is still really fun, though.
Traveler: I hope you weren't injured.

## Talk 3

Ruu: I'm gonna grow up as quick as I can, and then I'll become an adventurer, just like you!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Looks like we're done here as well!
Ruu: Wow, so this is what a real adventurer can do, huh?
Ruu: I mean, other people did come here before.
Ruu: But none of them were as strong as you and Paimon!
Paimon: Others!
Ruu: Yeah, they came to look for Maushiro.
Traveler: Huh, then Sumida must've...
Paimon: Paimon doesn't get it, though. What are these Maushiro? We've heard that they're traditional instruments that the people here use...
Ruu: Yup~ They make sounds and stuff.
Ruu: It's hard for us to see in this fog, right? That's why we use the Maushiro to tell others where we are.
Ruu: I mean, it sure beats yelling! That really hurts the throat.
Paimon: It's true that you can't see anything around here...
Ruu: Right?
Ruu: Da... Grandpa Mata said that the Maushiro can help the souls of those lost in the fog to find their way back home, so they're very important.
Paimon: So they're that important, huh?
Traveler: No wonder you need them in the ceremony.
Ruu: That's right. I'm sure you'll both enjoy it very much!
Ruu: You guys go first. I'd like to stay under the tree for while more.
Paimon: Sure you'll be alright? There might be monsters out there...
Ruu: I'll be fine!
Traveler: No wonder Katheryne had this pegged as a toughie...
