Traveler: Entry Permit?
Yurika: According to our current regulations, foreign merchants must apply for an Entry Permit if they wish to stay and do business in Ritou for a long period.
Yurika: As such, please get your identification papers prepared before moving forward with these procedures... as well as the other necessary "materials."
