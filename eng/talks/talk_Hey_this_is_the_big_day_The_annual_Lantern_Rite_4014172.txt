Kun: Hey, this is the big day! The annual Lantern Rite is finally here!
Kun: You see, seeing all of Liyue Harbor this lively is quite a rare sight.
Kun: If it wasn't for the fact that I need to stick to my post, I'd have bought a kite to fly already.
Kun: I mean, hearing them talk, you'd know that with that new mechanical propulsion thingamabob, any kite can fly with ease!
Kun: ...Hmm. Does that mean that I could fly a kite while working?
