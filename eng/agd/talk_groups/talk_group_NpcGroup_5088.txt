Traveler: What sorts of documents?
Imena: Ah, it's some communications between the Fortress of Meropide and the Palais Mermonia. I'm in charge of sorting them out before handing them over to the Chief Justice.
Imena: To be honest, the documents from the Fortress have always been perfect. I just need to go down, come back up, and hand them in.
Imena: Sometimes I can even get a nice meal at the Coupon Cafeteria over there — no wonder a retired senior of mine said that you couldn't go wrong with this job.
