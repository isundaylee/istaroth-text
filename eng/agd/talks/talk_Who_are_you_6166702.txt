Traveler: Who are you?
Orban: My name is unimportant, only my work is.
Orban: Have you heard of the weapon named Cool Steel? It's the sword of the adventurer Herman, who was once famed throughout the continent. I forged it for him.
Orban: ...Though a number of people praised it quite highly, it was one of my more ordinary forging projects.
Orban: For me, the most important weapon is the next one I'm making...
Orban: That one alone deserves to be remembered as part of my legacy.
