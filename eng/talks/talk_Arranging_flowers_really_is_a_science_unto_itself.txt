# Talk Dialog

Pauline: Arranging flowers really is a science unto itself...
Paimon: Are you running into any problems, Pauline?
Pauline: It's not really a big deal.
Pauline: Usually, I always sell flowers by variety, because I think they would be clear to customers at a glance...
Pauline: But recently, I heard that combining several kinds of flowers can make them complement each other and look more beautiful.
Pauline: I tried to match the different flowers, and although I don't quite understand how it works, the business of the shop during the festival is significantly more busy.
Pauline: So I was wondering, how do you cultivate this particular kind of artistic sense? Do you have to find a professional mentor?
Paimon: Hmm, what Pauline said is definitely something worth thinking about.
Paimon: #What do you think, Traveler?
