Traveler: No track repairs today?
Ferdinand: Aw, come on, what kind of rails need to be repaired daily... And thanks to you, we just fixed 'em! From now on we'll only need to do regular maintenance.
Ferdinand: Though... if Haddo starts designing some new track, then we'll have some serious work to do.
Ferdinand: Jeroney is the brain, Haddo is the designer, and I'm the brawn. That's how it works.
