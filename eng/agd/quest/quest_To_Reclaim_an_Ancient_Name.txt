# To Reclaim an Ancient Name


## Talk 1

Paimon: What can you tell us about the Scions of the Canopy?
Chasca: The tribespeople are very adventurous.
Paimon: Oh, kind of like us, then!
Chasca: Hmm... I'm not so sure. You don't strike me as the type to enjoy danger.
Chasca: The Scions of the Canopy are a bunch of thrill-seekers. They love extreme sports like rock climbing, rappelling, volcano parkour...
Chasca: Or even bungee jumping without a rope while a Yumkasaur stands at the edge and uses its tongue to catch them. Sound like something you'd be interested in?
Paimon: Okay... that does sound different from our usual "adventures."
Paimon: Paimon's not doing any of that! She can just cheer you on from the sidelines!

## Talk 2

Chasca: That's Wayna, the tribal chief. Let's head over to him.

## Talk 3

Chasca: Wayna's right over there. Let's go.

## Talk 4

Mualani: Hello. Do you have any hook-ropes for sale?
Amauta: Hook-ropes? As in rock climbing equipment?
Mualani: Yes. How much for your whole stock?
Amauta: The whole thing? Let me see... That would be 30,000 Mora in total. Deal?
Mualani: Deal.
Amauta: Wait, really?
Mualani: What, you want me to drive down the price? We just need these as fast as possible. Thanks.
Amauta: No problem at all! I'll even pass along some information on the house. These ropes are usually used by rock climbing enthusiasts. If you want to learn, Roca's the person you want to ask.
Amauta: Alright, that's everything. Here you go.
Chasca: Now, we need the Obsidian. Let's go talk to the Traveling Merchant Vichama mentioned.

## Talk 5

Mualani: Excuse me, do you sell Obsidian?
Pajaten: Why, yes! I've got a chunk for sale right over there.
Mualani: Perfect! Is that the only one, though? We actually need two.
Pajaten: Hmm, that might be tough. Tell you what, I'll take a look through these boxes over here, and we'll see what we can find.
Mualani: Thank you so much. We'll wait here.
Mualani: Phew...
Chasca: Relax. Everything's going according to plan.
Mualani: I know... It's just, I could tell Vichama feels the same way about his friend that I do about Kachina. I hope this chunk of Obsidian isn't the only one...
Mualani: Kachina always carries all sorts of shiny stones with her. If I was the one trapped in the Night Kingdom, she'd have a whole pile of Obsidian ready in a heartbeat.
Pajaten: Well, would you look at that, I did bring an extra... Here you go, young lady. How does it look?
Mualani: Perfect! Thank you! How much do I owe you?
Pajaten: If you hadn't shown up, these stones would have just sat here collecting dust. I'll take 3,000 Mora for both.
Pajaten: Here you go... By the way, I heard you mention Vichama just now. You running an errand for him, then?
Pajaten: How's he doing? Mallko's been gone for five years, now. It's about time he started to move forward.
Paimon: Do you know what happened between them?
Pajaten: I heard about it in passing while I was out drinking one night, but I don't know all the details. Vichama and Mallko grew up together and even made a name for themselves together.
Pajaten: Mallko was an amazing fighter, capable of knocking out multiple opponents in a single hit, while Vichama excelled at scouting and analyzing the battlefield. The two made an excellent team, and managed to beat back the Abyss several times.
Pajaten: Five years ago, they both emerged triumphant in the Pilgrimage and were placed on the same team to fight the Abyss.
Pajaten: But on the eve of battle, the Abyss launched an attack on their tribe, and Vichama suffered an injury to his leg while attempting to rescue someone.
Paimon: Then what happened?
Pajaten: The team agreed that he couldn't go fight the Abyss in his condition.
Pajaten: Vichama didn't argue. He knew going to the front lines with an injured leg would make him a burden in battle. So, they raised the issue with the Pyro Archon, and she agreed to let him stay behind.
Pajaten: It's just... Mallko and the others ended up facing hordes of Abyssal monsters in numbers that far exceeded anyone's expectations. The team made an error in judgment, and they fell to the onslaught.
Pajaten: Vichama went into a deep depression after that. He blames himself for everything.
Traveler: It was an impossible situation...
Pajaten: You're not wrong. But, it's possible he chooses to blame himself, not because he did something wrong, but because he wasn't able to do anything at all.
Pajaten: I've tried convincing him to move forward, to stop dwelling on the past. But, the shadow of Mallko's death hangs over him still.
Pajaten: The Abyss has caused so much suffering, and some wounds never heal. I wish there was something he could do to make himself feel better, but... *sigh*
Pajaten: Anyway, that's the gist of it. Maybe you could help him talk things through sometime. I would really appreciate it.
Traveler: It doesn't sound like it was his fault.

## Talk 6

Vichama: Did you get everything?
Mualani: Yup, it's all here. When do we start?
Vichama: I've made all the necessary adjustments, so we're good to go.
Vichama: As agreed, I'll help you find Kachina's Ancient Name, and then you return the favor.
Traveler: Could I ask a question?
Vichama: Go ahead.
Traveler: Are you seeking your friend's Ancient Name...
Vichama: ...Yes.
Vichama: After Mallko fell, I scoured the battlefield to see what happened. It turned out... he wasn't bested by some impossibly powerful foe. He was dragged to his grave by the sheer number of enemies.
Vichama: If I had been there, I would've been able to sense the danger. I could've warned them not to advance...
Vichama: I've always blamed myself for what happened... But, when you told me about Kachina, I realized there's a chance Mallko might also be alive, fighting for survival in the Night Kingdom.
Paimon: But... that happened several years ago, right?
Paimon: The Pyro Archon said all life within the Night Kingdom eventually becomes one with the sea of souls...
Vichama: There might not be much hope, but I still have to try. Mallko and I promised each other... Even if we never managed to root out the Abyss for good, we would fight together until the end.
Vichama: Alright, let's get to it. I'll start searching for the "conceptualized" version of Kachina's Ancient Name. If you see any "fragments" scattered around the area, please collect them.
Vichama: Make sure you prepare yourselves for battle. As I said, the Stone will link the mortal realm to the Night Kingdom. The Abyss will likely emerge in response.
Traveler: ...For the same reason as us?

## Talk 7

Paimon: Whoa, this place looks so different now... What happened here?

## Talk 8

Pajaten: I hope Vichama can move past this whole thing soon...

## Talk 9

Pajaten: Looking to buy something?

## Talk 10

Paimon: Vichama!
Vichama: Quick... Take it!
Vichama: I found Kachina's Ancient Name... Hang in there, Mallko... Just a little longer...
Chasca: Something's not right. The power of the Abyss is getting stronger.
Mualani: The Abyss is corroding his body! Vichama, you can't keep going, you'll die—
Vichama: ...I should've died five years ago.
Vichama: I just need a little more time. Please! I'm almost there!
Traveler: Understood.
Vichama: Thank you.
Chasca: This power...
Mualani: Hanging in there?
Traveler: I can't hold them back much longer!
Vichama: Mallko... No! Why can't I find him!? Why...
Chasca: We can't wait any longer. Pull him away from the Stone, Mualani!
Mualani: I already tried, but the power of the Abyss has him in a chokehold... It's like he's tied to the Stone with an invisible rope.
Chasca: In that case, we have no choice. I'm sorry, Citlali.
Chasca: ...Get back.
Mualani: ...Chasca? Wait—
Paimon: Ouch... What happened just now? It looked like the Spiritspeaker Stone was—
Chasca: The Stone's power was spiraling out of control. The only way to stop it was to destroy it.
Chasca: You were all caught in the shockwave of the explosion. You might feel dizzy for a while, but that's normal.
Mualani: Give us a heads up next time, will you? You're lucky we managed to dodge in time.
Chasca: I thought I said to get back...
Mualani: Yeah, barely a second before you made it go poof! Not everyone has your reflexes, Chasca. We were THIS close to getting dragged into the explosion!
Chasca: Okay, I'll be more careful next time.
Mualani: At least Kachina's Ancient Name is still in one piece... Wait, where's Vichama?
Mualani: Vichama!
Vichama: ...
Paimon: Vichama...
Vichama: I couldn't find Mallko's Ancient Name. It... must be completely gone by now.
Vichama: Once your Ancient Name disappears, there's no coming back. From the very beginning, I knew there was a slim chance, but still...
Vichama: And, now, it's too late to save him... From the minute he left that day, it was already too late.
Mualani: Vichama...
Chasca: I'm sure he's heard enough condolences over the years... Let's just give him some space.
Paimon: Huh? What's that in your hands, Vichama? It looks like something's glowing!
Vichama: Huh? This is...
Pisac: Hey, Mallko, got any strength left?
Mallko: Not enough to swing a sword, but to say a few last words? Sure...
Pisac: Haha, too bad no one will get to hear them.
Pisac: I never thought I'd actually die on this mission. *sigh* Not that I'm afraid to die, it's just... hard, thinking about my mom's face when she hears the news...
Mallko: Guess I have something to be thankful for, then. My parents died a long time ago... They won't have to mourn me.
Pisac: ...
Mallko: Pisac? Hah, always had to beat me at everything, didn't you... Right to the end, you never were one for goodbyes.
Mallko: Maybe you're right, maybe no one will get to hear our last words. But, just in case...
Mallko: Vichama, I'm so glad you didn't come with us.
Mallko: Don't be sad. Just keep on living... for the both of us.
Vichama: ...
Paimon: Was that... a memory?
Chasca: Seems like we were able to salvage something after all.
Traveler: Feeling any better, Vichama?
Vichama: Of course. Seeing him, hearing his voice again... It makes me unbelievably happy.
Vichama: ...But, it also brings with it an even deeper pain.
Paimon: A deeper pain? Why?
Vichama: Mallko was always the type to put on a brave face, but in that memory just now... his hands were shaking, and his smile was forced.
Traveler: Really?
Vichama: For all these years, I regretted not being able to fight alongside him to the end. And now I know... At the end of his life, he was thinking the same thing.
Paimon: Vichama...
Vichama: I'm fine... Actually, I heard Chief Wayna wasn't really on board with your plan to go to the Night Kingdom.
Vichama: When you asked for my help, I hesitated, too. I knew helping you find your friend's Ancient Name meant leading you one step closer to danger.
Vichama: But... I also understood why you had to try. Everyone has regrets in life, but not everyone gets the chance to make up for them.
Vichama: Once allowed to fester, guilt strips us of our most valuable qualities as warriors. In that sense, we might as well choose the braver path from the very beginning...
Traveler: A more courageous way?
Vichama: If I could do it all over again, I would have followed Mallko to the frontlines no matter what. Even with an injured leg, there were still things I could have done.
Vichama: That way... even if the outcome stayed the same, I still would have fought alongside him to the end.
Vichama: There are critical junctures in life, and if you don't seize the chance to act, there's no going back.
Vichama: That's something I had to learn in hindsight, but you're still at the crossroads of your journey, so... I hope you can walk away without regrets.
Mualani: Thank you, Vichama. I feel even more determined, now. Kachina will come back to us — I'll make sure of it.
Mualani: I promised I would find her, and I intend to keep that promise.
Vichama: That's good to hear. *cough* Strange... My body, it's...
Chasca: #Once Abyssal corrosion enters the body, a portion will fuse itself to your internal organs. Even though Traveler possesses powers of purification, the corrosion can never be fully eradicated.
Chasca: #Thanks to him, though, you were only briefly exposed. Slowing your breathing and controlling your emotions should help you keep the symptoms in check.
Vichama: Phew... That does make me feel better. You seem very knowledgeable about all this.
Chasca: Just speaking from experience, that's all.
Mualani: Anyway, we've recovered Kachina's Ancient Name, so we're off to a great start. Let's get Vichama back to his tribe and tell Wayna the good news.
Mualani: Oh, um... and apologize for destroying the Spiritspeaker Stone. We had no choice, though, so he'll probably understand... right?
Traveler: You mean fighting while injured?
Traveler: Yeah, you're right...
Traveler: We're running out of time!
Traveler: I'll help buy you some time.

## Talk 11

Vichama: I hope you have a safe journey and overcome any danger that comes your way.

## Talk 12

Chuychu: ...
Wayna: ...
Wayna: Chuychu, are you really gonna just stand there like that? I don't know what you want from me...
Chuychu: I think you know exactly what I'm trying to say, Uncle Wayna. I can hear it in your voice.
Wayna: Honestly, it's just one thing after another with you two...
Wayna: Ah, they're back.
Chasca: Chuychu? What are you doing here?
Chuychu: Hah, don't play dumb with your own sister! You know exactly why I'm here.
Chuychu: My apologies, everyone, I just need to borrow Chasca for a few minutes.... You, come with me.
Chasca: *sigh*... I'll be just a moment.
Paimon: Who was that?
Wayna: Chuychu... Chasca's younger sister, although the two aren't actually related by blood. It's kind of a long story...
Traveler: Right! She did call herself Chasca's "sister" just now.
Wayna: It's not really my story to tell, but I guess it's not a secret... You see, Chasca was actually raised by Qucusaurs.
Wayna: She was afflicted with a rare disease when she was a child and abandoned in the wild as a result. The Abyss found her out there, all on her own, and tried to devour her. But, in the end, all that did was trigger her will to live.
Wayna: That strength of will pushed her to survive, but it also planted a seed of "conflict" within her. Eventually, she was adopted by the Qucusaurs. Wherever they went, she followed, getting into fights right and left.
Paimon: For some reason, Paimon can totally imagine that...
Wayna: Haha, well, when Chasca finally returned to human society, it was Chuychu's parents who adopted her. At the time, Chasca still had a habit of getting into fights, so Chuychu was always taking her around, apologizing to everyone.
Mualani: Aww, I remember those days! One of those fights was definitely with me... But, you know kids... You're fighting one minute, and you're friends the next!
Mualani: Eventually, she found a way to rein in that desire to fight, and now she's who people call to resolve conflicts. She's known as "the Peacemaker."
Mualani: ...It sounds like she still argues with Chuychu, though. Don't siblings usually stop fighting when they get older?
Wayna: *sigh* That's partly my fault. Chuychu asked me to stop Chasca from doing anything dangerous, but you probably know by now, once Chasca makes up her mind, there's no changing it.
Mualani: Ahh, I get it. No wonder you tried to talk us out of going to the Night Kingdom. Chasca even said that wasn't like you.
Wayna: I'm all for your adventure. You need to take risks when you're young, 'cause by the time you're my age, you couldn't attempt something like that even if you wanted to. Better try now than live with regrets later, that's what I say.
Wayna: Still, I can understand where Chuychu's coming from. In the end, nobody wants to sit back and let a loved one put their life on the line.
Chuychu: Alright, it's just the two of us now. You have one minute to explain yourself.
Chasca: I don't have anything to say. You don't have to approve, but you should know I only do what's necessary.
Chuychu: That attitude is exactly the problem. It's like you don't care! You try to sneak off to the Night Kingdom behind my back, and then play it down, as if it's just a trip abroad.
Chasca: Well... technically, I am going abroad, right?
Chuychu: Again with the excuses!
Chasca: ...
Chuychu: We agreed, didn't we? There are four levels of danger. If it's not something urgent, you can only engage in level 2 danger and below. You can only go up to level 3 if a situation is so dire, there's absolutely no alternative.
Chuychu: But, a trip to the Night Kingdom? If that's not a level 4, I don't know what is. And you were just going to sneak into the place without saying anything!
Chasca: What do you mean, sneak into the place? I always planned on walking in there with my head held high.
Chuychu: You bought off Uncle Wayna, didn't you? He promised me he'd stop you from doing anything dangerous. It's like he didn't even try!
Chasca: You feel like he went back on his word? What if I told you my mind was made up, and there was nothing he could have done — not even by force?
Chuychu: I knew it! So he did try to say something, but you didn't listen!
Chasca: This is important. If you were in my shoes, you'd make the same decision.
Chuychu: You don't know that. I'm a doctor, and I handle logistics. If you're going to waltz into a dangerous situation where you could lose control at any moment, it's my duty to say something.
Chasca: Alright, whatever. Anything else?
Chuychu: You... What do you mean, "anything else"? Why don't you reflect on what you've done, and promise me you'll stay put.
Chasca: Time out... Is this one of our normal arguments, or a serious one?
Chuychu: Chasca, does it sound like I'm joking?
Chasca: Then, you need to know something. What happened to Kachina was partially my fault. I can't leave her there to die. That's not who I am.
Chuychu: But, the person you become when you lose control... That's also not who you are!
Chasca: That's a different issue. You said it yourself — a person is only as good as their morals. If I want to live in Natlan, I need to display qualities that make me worthy of this nation.
Chuychu: I've also told you that managing your condition is equally important.
Chasca: Sometimes, you have to make sacrifices. Alright, let's stop this here. If we keep going, I might actually have to get serious, and I think Wayna prefers his roof attached to his house.
Chuychu: Is that a threat? That sounds like a threat to me.
Chasca: Chuychu! Younger sisters are supposed to listen to their elders.
Chuychu: ...
Chuychu: So, you're really going to go? No matter what I say? I'm supposed to be your sister...
Chasca: Then, support me. I'll be back, all you have to do is wait.
Chuychu: *sigh*... Chasca...
Chuychu: So, that's it... Why'd you have to turn out to be so... darn... annoying!
Wayna: *sigh*... You two are something else...
Chasca: Something you wanted to say?
Wayna: I know you aren't related by blood, but you two sure are similar.
Chasca: Really?
Wayna: ...Y'know, I said that very thing to Chuychu not too long ago, and she reacted the exact same way, down to the very tone of voice.
Wayna: It's not my place to get involved, but I will say this... Try to spend a little more time with your sister. You're tough kids, but that doesn't mean you have to go it alone.
Chasca: ...Thank you.
Wayna: Anytime... Alright, if you're done with the Spiritspeaker Stone, you might as well hand it over.
Wayna: According to Kinich, it's an important ceremonial artifact, so it'd be safer to keep it with me.
Mualani: Um, about that...
Paimon: *sigh*... If only Tone-Deaf Bard was here. He could have "repaired" it just like the Holy Lyre...
Chasca: The Spiritspeaker Stone might be... two stones now.
Wayna: Huh?
Black Screen Text: You explain the sequence of events to Wayna...
Wayna: I see... *sigh* Sounds like it was an urgent situation. If someone's life was on the line, then you had no choice.
Wayna: Still, Citlali's gonna be a nightmare to deal with now that you've broken her stuff. I'll explain everything to her later.
Wayna: Stay safe out there in the Night Kingdom, okay? I'll wait here for your safe return.
Traveler: But, it feels like there's more to the story...
