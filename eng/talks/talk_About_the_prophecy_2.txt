Traveler: About the prophecy...
Etienne: Please, allow me to thank you again for the Magic Pocket you gave me earlier! It's extremely convenient for storage.
Etienne: Luckily, I'd already stuffed all my home's most valuable things in there. When the waters rose, everyone was so busy with rescue efforts that there wasn't time for anything else.
Etienne: But I still haven't taken out the stuff I put in, hehe... After all, Baguette can't break what's inside.
