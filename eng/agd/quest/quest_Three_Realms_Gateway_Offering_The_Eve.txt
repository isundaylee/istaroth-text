# Three Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve


## Talk 1

Paimon: Apparently, they held the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri in Sangonomiya recently. Paimon bets Kokomi was the host.
Paimon: Let's go pay her a visit.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hey look, a shrine maiden taking care of the wounded. That must be Tsumi, right?
Paimon: Let's go ask her about what's been going on.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Wow, it works! Let's go back and tell Tsumi.

## Talk 4

Ueno: Here's hoping I have the chance...
Traveler: The chance to do what?
Ueno: Next year, I'm going to apply for Swordfish I to be redeployed into Specter management. 'Cause if it's that or spend more time in Enkanomiya, I'll take my chance with the Specters.
Ueno: Those armor monsters... closing in on you, "ker-chunk, ker-chunk"... It's the stuff nightmares are made of.
Paimon: Totally understand.
Ueno: Anyway. We should be safe for now. There shouldn't be any more danger from here on out.
Yabe: Hey! Whassup!
Ueno: It's Yabe... The odd guy from Stingray III.
Paimon: You seem kinda chipper compared to all the other soldiers.
Yabe: Do I? Hehehe. I've pretty much always loved horror stories and ghost stories and stuff. Ever since I was a kid. This trip to Enkanomiya is something else, though — totally mind-blowing.
Yabe: Super fun, 10/10 would come again.
Paimon: Totally do not understand...
Yabe: Well, I mean, it's pretty sweet to have the chance to come to Enkanomiya. I actually kinda wanted to look into the Bunkoku Puzzle while I'm here. It's the first of the four great puzzles of Enkanomiya.
Ueno: Yeah, please don't do that. We're the ones that'll have to come rescue you.
Yabe: Alright, well never mind that. There's a makeshift camp at the top of those steps over there. Yeah, you should head up and catch some rest if you haven't been there yet.

## Talk 5

Yabe: Have you been to the camp yet? Tsumi's the one that set it up. It's over there at the *top of the steps.*
Yabe: Gotta get yourselves familiar with the base of operations before you go venturing into the darkness.

## Talk 6

Tsumi: You are... different from all the others. Are you human?
Paimon: #Well Traveler is, obviously! Just not a native of Watatsumi Island, that's all.
Tsumi: And you? A human hatchling?
Traveler: I doubt it.
Tsumi: Oh, really? Because I thought that humans lose the ability to fly when they reach adulthood, just like Bathysmal Vishaps lose the ability to see in color when they reach maturity.
Paimon: Tsumi, you seem to know a lot about vishaps.
Tsumi: Wait, how do you know my name?
Paimon: Oh, the wounded soldiers mentioned you.
Tsumi: Oh.
Traveler: We came to investigate the darkness.
Ueno: Greetings, my name is Ueno, acting captain of Swordfish I. We're here to evacuate the wounded and support the Traveler's investigation.
Ueno: Swordfish I needs to rest and reorganize before commencing the evacuation. I'll see you later.
Tsumi: So you're here to help resolve this, hmm?
Tsumi: Very well. It's taking all the energy I have to keep this light shining. I don't have the strength to try and combat the spreading darkness, too.
Paimon: Do you understand what's going on?
Tsumi: The Void Realm is invading. The people of Byakuyakoku believe that there are three realms: the Vishap Realm, the Human Realm, and the Void Realm.
Tsumi: The darkness spreading in Enkanomiya comes from the Void Abyss. Neither vishaps nor humans can endure it.
Paimon: But don't Bathysmal Vishaps like the dark?
Tsumi: No. They hate the light, but only because down here in the depths, the presence of light signifies human activity.
Tsumi: In fact, the Vishap Realm is the realm of pure, primordial elemental beings. It's actually referred to as the Light Realm in most books.
Tsumi: The Seven Sovereigns of the Light Realm are the seven foremost elemental dragons at the pinnacle of the raw and primitive elemental forces.
Paimon: So that's why Tsuyuko called this the "Three Realms Gateway Offering."
Tsumi: "Three Realms Gateway Offering"... Not far off the mark, actually. But technically, I think it should be called the "Triangle Gateway Offering."
Tsumi: Because the source of the darkness from the void is the three towers at the corners of Enkanomiya's triangular borders.
Paimon: Oh, the three towers! The ones where we did those trials.
Tsumi: You've been there before?
Paimon: It's a long story.
Tsumi: Oh.
Paimon: By the way, Tsumi, what's up with the weird mask?
Tsumi: To hide my face. It has to do with some things that happened as I was growing up. I just don't want to scare anyone, that's all.
Tsumi: Does that make me untrustworthy in your eyes?
Paimon: No, not at all. You've been helping the wounded all this time, everyone must be super grateful to you. It's just that...

## Talk 7

Paimon: It looks like they're resting. Let's not disturb them.

## Talk 8

Enomoto: Hello, what can I help you with?
Paimon: Hi there. We wanted to ask you what you know about the masked shrine maiden, Tsumi.
Enomoto: I see, I see. What're you looking to know, exactly? I've tried asking if she's seeing anyone, y'know, or whether she's looking right now... but she seems pretty tight-lipped about her love life.
Paimon: That's... not what we meant at all. We were more wondering... do you think there's anything suspicious about her?
Enomoto: "Suspicious," huh... suspicion, the unknowable, the unpredictable... unexplored territory... Mysterious? Enigmatic? Enchanting. Bewitching. Compelling, addicting. Yeah. Know what I'm saying?
Traveler: Be serious.
Enomoto: I am being serious!
Enomoto: Okay, look — if I had to pick one thing about her that's suspicious, I'd say... okay, two things. Number one, her mask. It's pretty scary, I don't know why she chose it.
Enomoto: Number two, some kind of pendant fell out of her sleeve when she was bandaging me up. It looked like it was a broken-off piece of something. So maybe when you put them together, it makes a whole.
Enomoto: Huh, maybe the other half is held by Tsumi's lifelong sweetheart...
Paimon: Sounds like you hit the nail on the head. So you know, maybe ease off a little, bro?

## Talk 9

Imaizumi: Greetings.
Paimon: Hello. We'd like to ask you about the masked shrine maiden, Tsumi.
Imaizumi: Because of her strange mask?
Imaizumi: Well, you've come to the right person.
Paimon: Cool!
Imaizumi: I was one of the first people that she rescued. Straight away, I thought there was something very weird going on... Who is this shrine maiden who knows the lost ceremonies of Enkanomiya, and why is she covering her face with a mask?
Imaizumi: So I started pestering her about it. I wasn't going to let up until I got an answer.
Paimon: And?
Imaizumi: There weren't so many people around at that time, so eventually, she let me look behind the mask. It was actually pretty normal for the most part. There's just one thing she's trying to hide.
Imaizumi: Her eyes have snake-like pupils. Thin vertical lines.
Paimon: Whoa! Weren't you scared?
Imaizumi: I probably would have been, if every Watatsumi Islander wasn't so familiar with our legends... or I should say, our history.
Imaizumi: The first familiars of the Watatsumi Omikami were the Vassals of Watatsumi. Legend has it that they are a half-human, half-snake kind who helped our ancestors fight back the Bathysmal Vishaps.
Imaizumi: They were said to have disappeared long ago. But then Tsumi showed up, and as soon as I saw her snake eyes, I instinctively trusted her. It's like the vassals have returned to help us in our moment of need.
Paimon: Huh...
Imaizumi: I'm no expert, by any means. But I think Tsumi can be trusted.

## Talk 10

Tsuyuko: Specter Eco-Management... I hear Liyue has a program to get rid of rats, cockroaches, flies, and barnacles.
Tsuyuko: Specter Eco-Management must be the same kind of thing.

## Talk 11

Paimon: So here's what we learned from the soldiers.
Paimon: Tsumi's mask hides her snake-eyes, which the people of Watatsumi Island believe to be a distinguishing feature of Orobaxi's vassals.
Paimon: Based on her actions, it seems like all she wants to do is protect the people of Watatsumi Island. And from what she said, she's doing everything she can to combat the darkness spreading in Enkanomiya.
Paimon: So she seems pretty trustworthy.
Traveler: I agree.
Paimon: Then let's go talk to her about working together.
Traveler: I still have some reservations...
Paimon: Paimon gets it. Like, why is she covering her pupils when they're obviously an easy way to win everyone over?
Paimon: Guess we'll just have to see what she has to say for now. But let's keep our guard up, just in case.

## Talk 12

Tsumi: So, how's it going? Have you made a decision?
Paimon: Yep. Let's team up to tackle the darkness.
Tsumi: Okay. Then, take this.
Tsumi: It's called the Bokuso Box. I found it in the Dainichi Mikoshi when I was looking for a solution.
Tsumi: Actually, the Dainichi Mikoshi was where I found the method and tools for the Sentou Ceremony. Lucky I can read human writing.
Paimon: ...Uhh, why wouldn't you be able to? Or did you mean it's lucky that you can read the ancient Enkanomiyan script?
Tsumi: Oh, uh, nothing. I just meant the script in the Deep-Sea Healing Arts Compendium. I don't actually know if it's ancient or modern.
Traveler: I'm getting more confused the more you try to explain.
Tsumi: Never mind all that. Let's get back to business.
Tsumi: The Bokuso Box collects light. It can dispel the darkness from the Void within a small radius.
Tsumi: So for example, with the power of the Bokuso Box, you can turn monsters affected by the darkness back into their original forms.
Tsumi: As it happens, there are some monsters causing trouble around the camp. Go and try out the Bokuso Box on them. I will join you shortly.

## Talk 13

Tsumi: You're a good fighter.
Paimon: You bet. We were the ones who went and got the Bloodbranch Coral that one time, after all.
Tsumi: ...!
Tsumi: You...! So you...
Paimon: Wh—What's wrong?
Tsumi: Nothing. If what you say is true, then I'm sure that you'll be able to conquer the three border towers quite easily.
Tsumi: Also, there are a few things I need to explain to you.
Tsumi: According to what I have read, the fundamental purpose of the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri is to use the serpent god's life force to awaken its second familiars: the Sangacorallia.
Tsumi: They are creatures that break down raw, primitive elemental energy into the milder elemental energy of the human realm. The giant coral is a symbol that the Sangacorallia have been awakened by the serpent's blood.
Tsumi: The mass awakening of the Sangacorallia causes a transformation in the ecological environment of Enkanomiya.
Paimon: Makes sense. Even if you took away the darkness and the monsters, Enkanomiya would still look pretty different now with all the new plants and ore around.
Tsumi: Things are even more complicated than usual this time. The darkness from the Void Realm seems to be suppressing things in the Light Realm and the Human Realm, causing them to come to a standstill.
Tsumi: You may need to use the power of the Bokuso Box to dispel the darkness and allow the ecological transformation to continue.
Tsumi: Please try to solve the problem using the Bokuso Box.
Tsumi: I'll wait for an update from you under the statue over there.

## Talk 14

Tsumi: It seems that you have mastered the Bokuso Box. Now, let me tell you about the ultimate purpose of this operation.
Tsumi: As I said, we need to proceed to the three towers on Enkanomiya's borders. They are Towers of the Void, restored to their original form by a certain Abyss adherent.
Paimon: Abyss adherent? Wait, do you mean...
Tsumi: He's a purveyor of incessant nonsense. Somehow, he found out about the Three Realms and the three corners, and brought those things in using Abyssal technology.
Tsumi: Then, he started disseminating Abyssal energy using the towers. This caused great suffering for both the Sangacorallia and the Bathysmal Vishaps.
Tsumi: I don't know why he is doing this. For us, the Abyss is highly toxic, for them... intoxicating is more the word. Addictive, but still destructive.
Tsumi: Maybe he just likes to toy with people and stab them in the back.
Paimon: Paimon knows exactly who you're talking about.
Tsumi: You know him? Then it seems we have a common enemy.
Paimon: Oh, you bet we do!
Tsumi: To get rid of the darkness, you need to climb to the very top of the Towers of the Void and activate the Light Realm Chisel, which will let in the energy of the Light Realm.
Tsumi: In Enkanomiya, the Ley Lines of the Human Realm, the elemental currents of the Light Realm, and the dark currents of the Void Realm are all exceptionally strong.
Tsumi: Also, I only performed the Sentou Ceremony going off the steps in the book. But I believe the key to the ceremony is the statue in front of us.
Tsumi: You can offer crystals of Light Realm energy to it to increase the Bokuso Box's power. Also, resting here can restore the box's energy.
Tsumi: Please take this hand-drawn map. I've marked out the locations of the three towers for you. You'll need to explore one step at a time, and I'd recommend you start with this tower.
Tsumi: Well, that's as much help as I can offer you. I'll be waiting here for the good news.

## Additional Conversations

### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: Not yet.
Ueno: Please make sure you are fully prepared.

### Additional Talk 2

Tsumi: So, how's it going? Have you made a decision?
Paimon: Uhh... Still thinking things over.
Tsumi: Nothing wrong with that. Even if you're just too afraid to venture out, no one can blame you.

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: Let's go.
Ueno: Alright. Follow me.

### Additional Talk 4

Tsumi: Please, go and fend off the monsters. Don't forget to use the power of the box.
Tsumi: I'm going to observe the movement of the darkness. I'll catch up with you shortly.

### Additional Talk 5

Tsumi: How is it going? Any interesting results so far?

### Additional Talk 6

Imaizumi: As long as Tsumi stays around, we shouldn't have any problems.

### Additional Talk 7

Enomoto: I can feel a beard coming on. Oh! Do you guys think shaving it with a weapon would work?

### Additional Talk 8

Enomoto: Come on, man, please! My whole life depends on this!
Imaizumi: I don't know any other girls, okay? There's no one I can introduce you to.
Enomoto: No, no, not that. There's no mirror here, so could you trim my beard for me? Just use your weapon, it'll be fine.
Imaizumi: I've met newly planted carrots with bushier beards than you. I think you're good.

### Additional Talk 9

Ueno: ...This is the correspondence from Stingray III. Your Excellency, the situation looks extremely serious.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Thank you, Ueno. Inform Swordfish I to stand by. I'll see to the wounded shortly.
Ueno: Yes, Ma'am.
Paimon: Hey, Kokomi! How've you been?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ah, Captain of Swordfish II. Glad to have you back on Watatsumi Island. I would have liked to have given you a grand reception, but as you can see...
Paimon: What's going on?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Not long ago, I hosted the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri. It's the most important ceremony on Watatsumi Island. I'm guessing you'll have heard about it from Tsuyuko—
Paimon: What? How did you know we were the ones helping out Tsuyuko this whole time?
Traveler: I'd be more surprised if she didn't know...
Traveler: How could you not tell, Paimon?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ahem. Tsuyuko is one of the more conscientious shrine maidens of Sangonomiya. I knew that handing off the planning of the ceremony to her would play to her strengths.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Based on her description of the person who took the commission, it was quite obviously you.
Paimon: This is all starting to sound pretty suspicious...
Traveler: It's a bit late for that now, Paimon.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Anyway. I'm sure Tsuyuko will have told you that the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri is a ceremony to reverse the Holy Soil phenomenon on Watatsumi Island.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It's a bleaching process that slowly turns the earth to "Holy Soil," leaving the land infertile and devastating agricultural production.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Granted, crops aren't our staple food on Watatsumi Island, but I can't allow external forces to drastically alter the people's diet — and we certainly shouldn't be overly reliant on imports...
Paimon: Paimon doesn't quite follow...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Imagine all you had to eat from now on was radishes, no more fish or meat. Clearer now?
Traveler: (Opposite day. There's something Paimon can follow.)
Paimon: That would be terrible!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The issue began with the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri. I did not miss a single step during the ritual and there's no question that the Bloodbranch Coral you retrieved was infused with the Omikami's power...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: But it didn't reverse the Holy Soil phenomenon as expected. Instead, it just... paused. This has never happened before in history.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: This is ultimately a matter of Watatsumi Island's survival, so I sent as many people as I could spare to Enkanomiya to investigate the situation.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The news from Stingray III was that "All of Enkanomiya is engulfed in a darkness that cannot be dispelled." Additionally, there have also been reports of monsters the likes of which no one has ever seen before.
Paimon: Strange monsters and... an all-engulfing darkness?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: That's all that Stingray III has reported. Their investigation otherwise has yielded no useful information, and the unforgiving environment has caused many casualties so far...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I have sent several rescue teams already, but so far... the situation does not look promising.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: #It brings me no pleasure to have to ask, but on behalf of all of Watatsumi Island... I beseech you. Please lend us your assistance one more time, Traveler.
Traveler: Anything for you, Ma'am.
Traveler: For the sake of everyone on Watatsumi Island, I'll do it.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Heh... please don't joke around.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: But thank you for once again agreeing to put your life on the line for the sake of our island.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: #Thank you, Traveler.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Now, please come with me to meet Tsuyuko.

### Additional Talk 10

Traveler: I don't want to see another masked shrine maiden disappear...
Tsumi: Can't say I really understand what you're talking about.
Tsumi: Anyway, if you want to rid this darkness from Enkanomiya, you can come to me for guidance. Of course... if you can trust me.
Tsumi: I'm going inside to tend to the wounded and check in with the new arrivals. Please excuse me.
Black Screen Text: After she finishes speaking, Tsumi heads to an inner room...
Paimon: #What're we gonna do, Traveler? Paimon really wants to trust Tsumi, but...
Paimon: How about we go ask the wounded?

### Additional Talk 11

Traveler: I don't want to be betrayed again.
Tsumi: Me neither. I hate betrayal too.
Tsumi: Anyway, if you want to rid this darkness from Enkanomiya, you can come to me for guidance. Of course... if you can trust me.
Tsumi: I'm going inside to tend to the wounded and check in with the new arrivals. Please excuse me.
Black Screen Text: After she finishes speaking, Tsumi heads to an inner room...
Paimon: #What're we gonna do, Traveler? Paimon really wants to trust Tsumi, but...
Paimon: How about we go ask the wounded?
