# Courage Is in the Heart


## Talk 1

Paimon: Huh? These hilichurls dropped something strange...
Paimon: It seems to be made out of flowers. Weird, but these flowers are ordinary and were picked quite some time ago, yet they still haven't wilted.
Paimon: Paimon can sense quite a lot of Dendro energy on it, and it's been discarded here, too...
Traveler: It must belong to Aranara.
Paimon: Yeah, must be.
Paimon: Hmm, this flower thing has so much Dendro energy that it didn't even wither in the hands of the hilichurls.
Traveler: Maybe they carried it with them all the time.
Paimon: Yep, let's return this to the Aranara as soon as possible.
Paimon: #Let's go inside the house, {NICKNAME}. Maybe whoever lost it is super bummed out right now!
Traveler: Maybe it's something very precious.
Traveler: It might be from a Dendro hilichurl...
Paimon: What are you saying? It must be from an Aranara who lives here.

## Talk 2

Inconsistently-Written Notes: (The first few pages contain very small and scribbled writing...)
Inconsistently-Written Notes: "Ohhh... I can't believe there is a Nara willing to be Arashakun's friend. What a good Nara! The good Nara didn't mind timid Arashakun, and even taught Arashakun how to write Nara words..."
Inconsistently-Written Notes: "...Good Nara comforted Arashakun when Arashakun was frightened by a leaf that fell on his head. Good Nara is Arashakun's friend forever!"
Inconsistently-Written Notes: (The handwriting becomes tinier and more flustered in the following pages...)
Inconsistently-Written Notes: "Oh no... Nara friend was taken by Furry Mask Demon King! It has such long arms. So scary..."
Inconsistently-Written Notes: "But... must save Nara... Ohh..."
Inconsistently-Written Notes: (The following pages are written in big, forceful handwriting...)
Inconsistently-Written Notes: "The Furry Mask Demon King has been defeated! Saved Nara friend, and Nara friend gave Arashakun 'courage'! Arashakun is not the same old timid Arashakun anymore."
Inconsistently-Written Notes: "Arashakun has 'courage' now and bravely fought the furry masked monsters. No Nara nearby will ever have to worry about getting bullied by the furry masked monsters again!"
Inconsistently-Written Notes: (The handwriting shrinks back down in the latest pages...)
Inconsistently-Written Notes: "Oh no... How did this happen? Arashakun's 'courage' is missing... The 'courage' Nara gave to Arashakun... It must have been stolen by the Furry Mask Demon King."
Inconsistently-Written Notes: "Furry Mask Demon King, arms very long, very scary. But Arashakun can do nothing after losing his 'courage'... Arashakun will go looking for it in <color=#00E1FFFF>the cave to the east</color>..."

## Talk 3

Paimon: Uh, so, is "Arashakun" the Aranara who wrote all this?
Paimon: The writing in this journal is big at times and real tiny at others. The big letters are fine, but...
Paimon: Gotta say, the small ones hurt Paimon's eyes a little.
Traveler: Our little Paimon's having trouble reading those small letters?
Paimon: Hey, Paimon reads letters in normal size just fine, thank you! Paimon's just not used to reading tiny letters, that's all!
Paimon: Hmm, did this Arashakun not return after writing these most recent pages...?
Paimon: Let's check out that cave in the east. The journal said that his courage is missing... Can "courage" really go missing? Paimon's curious...

## Talk 4

Paimon: Are you Arashakun?
Arashakun: *sob*... Arashakun is indeed my name... Eek, don't come so close so quickly!
Arashakun: Arashakun's very grateful to you two for saving me, but I must still request that you keep a certain distance... *sob*
Arashakun: That will make Arashakun feel a bit more comfortable...
Paimon: What? We just rescued you!
Arashakun: I'm sorry! Sorry for my rude request. Sorry for angering you...
Arashakun: But I've been trapped here and am still... Iâ€”I haven't settled down yet. *sob* Please forgive me...
Paimon: It's okay, it's okay...
Arashakun: Okay, thank you. May Arashakun get your names?
Paimon: It's Paimon.
Traveler: #I'm {NICKNAME}.
Arashakun: #Golden Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon... So, how come you know Arashakun's name?
Traveler: We read the journal in the house.
Arashakun: #Golden-haired Nara {NICKNAME} read the journal and came looking for Arashakun? Then rescued trapped Arashakun? Nara is so kind and so powerful.
Arashakun: *sob* If Arashakun hadn't lost "courage," Arashakun wouldn't have been so helpless...
Paimon: We read about that in the journal. What did you mean by missing "courage," Arashakun?
Arashakun: This is a story from long, long ago...
Arashakun: Many moons ago, Arashakun was just like the Arashakun now, without "courage." Back then, even the sound of a twig snapping would keep Arashakun up at night...
Arashakun: But even timid Arashakun had a Nara friend for a companion. That Nara friend was no mighty Nara Varuna, but was still a very good Nara!
Arashakun: He never teased timid Arashakun. When Arashakun felt scared, he would hold Arashakun's hand. He was a friend Arashakun would never forget.
Arashakun: But one day, that Nara was taken by the Furry Mask Demon King...
Paimon: Wait, what's this Furry Mask Demon King you speak of?
Arashakun: Furry Mask Demon King is a furry demon king wearing a mask.
Paimon: Uh, yeah, sure...
Traveler: Do you know what it is, Paimon?
Paimon: There's no way Paimon would know that...
Paimon: But the Furry Mask Demon King captured Arashakun's friend.
Arashakun: The Furry Mask Demon King was very cunning. Just thinking about it makes Arashakun shudder.
Arashakun: *sob*... When Nara friend was taken, Arashakun was afraid of getting beat up by the Furry Mask Demon King, but was even more terrified of never seeing Nara friend again.
Arashakun: So Arashakun tried very hard! Closed eyes! Gritted teeth! Used hands and hit, and hit, and hit! Then saved Nara friend.
Arashakun: After that, Nara friend used flowers to make a "Talisman of Courage" and told Arashakun, "Arashakun is a good Aranara with courage, not a timid Aranara!"
Arashakun: So from then on, Arashakun had "courage."
Paimon: But wasn't "Closed eyes! Gritted teeth! Used hands and hit, and hit, and hit!" very courageous?
Arashakun: No. Arashakun only had "courage" after getting it from Nara friend.
Paimon: But your act to save your friend was already brave.
Arashakun: No, no, no. Arashakun was so scared when saving Nara friend. Arms and legs, all shaky. But after getting "courage," Arashakun's arms and legs were not weak anymore.
Paimon: Ah...
Traveler: The talisman was just a symbol.
Arashakun: #*sob*... Nara {NICKNAME} is making this too complicated. Arashakun just know that there is "courage" only when I have the "Talisman of Courage."
Arashakun: After "courage" was stolen, Arashakun came to the cave of the Furry Mask Demon King to search, hoping to find clues for Arashakun to find "courage" again.
Paimon: But Arashakun ended up getting surrounded by slimes in the cave... Fortunately, the Furry Mask Demon King didn't notice.
Paimon: #Speaking of which... Remember that thing we picked up from the hilichurls, {NICKNAME}? Do you think that's the talisman?
Paimon: Arashakun, we might have found the courage you lost!
Arashakun: #Really? Have you really found Arashakun's "courage," Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon?
Traveler: The courage was in you all along!
Traveler: That's a very Aranara answer...
Paimon: Paimon has no clue what this Furry Mask Demon King could be...

## Talk 5

Arashakun: #*sob*... Would Nara {NICKNAME} mind giving my "courage" back to me...?

## Talk 6

Arashakun: Yes, this is it, this is it!
Arashakun: This is the "Talisman of Courage"! The flower has faded a bit after being apart from Arashakun for a few days...
Arashakun: But it's okay! Arashakun will guard it well from now on!
Arashakun: "Arashakun is a good Aranara with courage, not a timid Aranara!"
Arashakun: #Thank you so much, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon!
Arashakun: Arashakun now has "courage" back. Nothing can stop me! I beat Furry Mask Demon King once before and I shall do it again!
Paimon: (Whoa, Arashakun's attitude and tone are completely different now.)
Arashakun: #The Furry Mask Demon King has done a lot of evil things. Please come with me, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon. With your help, we'll defeat it for sure!
Arashakun: Arashakun can feel it. Today... will be the day it meets its end!
Paimon: #Okay then, {NICKNAME}, let's go and see what on earth that Furry Mask Demon King is supposed to be!

## Talk 7

Paimon: Paimon had her guesses... But as it turns out, the Furry Mask Demon King really was a hilichurl all along.
Arashakun: A hilichurl?
Paimon: Yes, the "Furry Mask Demon King" is actually a hilichurl.
Arashakun: Are all Hillychuchu "Furry Mask Demon Kings"?
Paimon: Uh, no...
Traveler: But that's all you need to know, Arashakun.
Arashakun: Okay, Arashakun understands.
Arashakun: #Yes, with help from Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon, Arashakun will lead the charge and be invincible! Even the devious Furry Mask Demon King will be no match!
Arashakun: Arashakun shall mark today with a big entry!
Traveler: A big entry...?
Arashakun: Yeah, a big entry in big writing!
Paimon: Arashakun with "courage" and without sure feel like two completely different Aranara.
Arashakun: Arashakun with no "courage" has weak arms and legs, but Arashakun with "courage" can do all sorts of amazing feats!
Arashakun: "Courage" is not just the best gift from Nara friend, but also the most important thing to Arashakun.
Paimon: Well, make sure you keep it safe and don't let the hilichurls steal it again!
Arashakun: Arashakun understands. Arashakun will never let "courage" go missing again!
