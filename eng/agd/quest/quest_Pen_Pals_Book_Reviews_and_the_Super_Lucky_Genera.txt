# Pen Pals, Book Reviews, and the Super Lucky General


## Talk 1

Paimon: Kokomi and Gorou will be boarding their boat home soon. Let's go down to the harbor and see them off.

## Talk 2

Sangonomiya Kokomi: This is the meeting spot.
Gorou: There's no one else around. It looks like we're early...
Yae Miko: My, my, who have we here?
Paimon: M—Miko!
Paimon: (Oh no, Paimon hadn't counted on running into Miko! She and Kokomi are on different sides, and they also believe in different gods...)
Paimon: (Are they gonna end up... having a fight?)
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Lady Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine — no wonder. I was just wondering where that air of superiority was coming from.
Yae Miko: Hehe, if it isn't the leader of Watatsumi Island, who looks as soft as a jellyfish, but whose words sting like one, too.
Paimon: Uh oh... this is getting out of control fast...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hello, nice to meet you, "Fried Tofu With All the Frills."
Yae Miko: The pleasure is all mine, "Sole of the Deep."
Yae Miko (Miko & Kokomi): Hehehehehe...
Paimon: Hey... what's going on here?
Paimon: Miko is Kokomi's pen pal!?
Paimon: No, it can't be. Look at them, clearly they already knew each other! Does that mean...
Traveler: This so-called meeting of pen pals...
Yae Miko: Hmm? Whatever are you talking about? I don't understand. I'm simply here for the book review session with Miss Sole of the Deep.
Yae Miko: Let's go. The venue for this meeting is in the Kanjou Commission headquarters up there. The view is excellent, making it a perfect place to drink tea and discuss creative ideas.
Paimon: Who holds a book review in the Kanjou Commission? You seriously expect anyone to believe that!?
Paimon: You're not here to talk about shaking up the Inazuman literary scene... You're here to talk about shaking up things in Inazuma as a whole.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hehe, Watatsumi Island will soon hold formal talks with the Shogunate on Inazuma's future development. It's essential to have an informal meeting like this one before the formal talks begin.
Yae Miko: Right. Especially with someone outside of the Shogunate like myself, who is in a good position to test out where each party draws the lines.
Yae Miko: But this is just our first meeting. It's a little too early to announce it to the general public.
Paimon: Huh, okay then.
Yae Miko: By the way, where is your general? Didn't you say he would be joining you?
Paimon: Huh, that's right... Where did Gorou go...?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Gorou went to buy some books for me. He won't be attending the book review.
Yae Miko: Oh, what a pity. I was rather looking forward to seeing his fluffy ears again.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: #Traveler, I'd like to talk to you for a moment.
Traveler: What's up?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I have been getting the sense that Gorou does not like having to deal with Guuji Yae, so I was initially reluctant to bring him to Ritou with me this time.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I noticed he instinctively hid as soon as he saw her just now. However, Gorou has a strong sense of responsibility, and will feel ashamed when he next sees me.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: So, I would like to give him the task of buying some books for me to make things easier for him.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: But Gorou rarely buys anything. So as a favor for me, I'd like to ask you to accompany him.
Traveler: Sure, leave it to me.
Paimon: Kokomi, you focus on the meeting with Miko. Leave the books to us and Gorou.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Thank you. I made a list of the books I'd like to buy. Please pass it on to Gorou.
Traveler: ...is just a cover-up?

## Talk 3

Paimon: Gorou, are you alright?
Gorou: Ah! It's you... *sigh* I wasn't expecting you-know-who to show up — it completely caught me by surprise. I had no idea what to say to her... Next thing I knew, I'd apparently already taken cover.
Gorou: I came here to ensure the safety of Her Excellency, but now I'm useless... I've become a burden instead.
Paimon: Gorou, don't be so hard on yourself. Actually, Kokomi asked us to give you a very important task.
Black Screen Text: You give Kokomi's list of books to Gorou.
Gorou: Her Excellency's purchase list... Got it, this is how Her Excellency wants me to make up for my mistakes! No problem, just leave it to me.
Paimon: Gorou, let us come with you. We can show you around the Irodori Festival while we're at it.
Gorou: Thank you so much!

## Talk 4

Gorou: There is a children's storybook on this list called "Night at Mt. Yougou." I think this is the stand where it's being sold.
Paimon: A children's storybook?
Gorou: Yes. It's for the children of Watatsumi Island. Her Excellency says that this book is simply written and very useful for learning new words.
Gorou: Hello, I'll take five copies of "Night at Mt. Yougou," please.
Fukumoto: Thank you for your patronage!
Fukumoto: Wow, you're a lucky customer! There's a coupon in one of the books you just bought which entitles you to a free gift!
Paimon: Wow, Gorou got a free gift! That's amazing.
Fukumoto: Here you go — a toy fox, it's all yours!
Gorou: What? A—A toy fox?
Fukumoto: Are you okay? The hair on your tail is standing on end...
Gorou: I'm fine, thanks for the gift.
Gorou: #Traveler, could you maybe, uh, look... l— look after the toy for me?
Traveler: Are you sure?
Gorou: Yes. As a thank-you gift for coming with me to buy the books.
Paimon: *sigh* Seems like Gorou still hasn't recovered from seeing Miko.
Gorou: Okay, next up... Hmm, this isn't the focus of this trip, but let's go buy a light novel.
Gorou: It says on the list that Her Excellency had an editor called Onodera purchase the latest issue of "A Legend of Sword" for her in advance. We'd better not keep him waiting too long.
Paimon: Oh, we know him. We'll lead the way.

## Talk 5

Gorou: Excuse me, are you Mr. Onodera? I'm here to pick up the new issue of "A Legend of Sword" for "Sole of the Deep."
Onodera: Hello there, yes, I have the book right here. I heard "Sole of the Deep" is a VIP of the Irodori Festival, but couldn't make it here in time for the signing event due to the shipping schedule.
Gorou: Also, if you have these books available, please give me one of each. Thank you.
Onodera: Alright, let me see...
Onodera: Oh my goodness, it's your lucky day today, sir!
Onodera: You are the 100th reader to buy "The Saga of Hamavaran"! That entitles you to receive a special-edition version with a review personally written by Lady Yae herself!
Gorou: Ugh... are you serious?
Onodera: Are you okay? You don't look very well.
Gorou: I—I'm fine. Thank you for the books.
Gorou: Her Ex.... "Sole of the Deep" asked me to buy this book, after all. I'm sure she'll be very happy to receive a special version with a chief editor's review, hah, haha.
Paimon: Gorou does not look like he's enjoying this at all. Paimon doesn't know if he's lucky or unlucky.
Onodera: Oh, one other thing — because of the amount of your purchase, you're able to enter the Yae Publishing House's lucky draw. Please come with me, right this way.

## Talk 6

Onodera: Sir, please take your lucky draw whenever you are ready.
Murata: Just turn the handle and a prize ball will come out. Maybe today's your lucky day!
Paimon: Come on, Gorou, go for it!
Murata: Let me see... Wow, incredible! You got the golden ball, that's the grand prize!
Paimon: Gorou, you're a lucky dog today! So what is the grand prize, anyway?
Murata: The grand prize is a full collection of each light novel published by Yae Publishing House!
Murata: Not only is the prize awarded personally by Lady Yae, but you will also have the chance to shake hands and take a photo with her to commemorate the occasion!
Gorou: What? Not only do I have to meet her... but I have to shake her hand and take a photo with her, too!?
Traveler: Gorou! Hang in there!
Youta: What? This guy won the Yae Publishing House's grand prize? Wow, that's so lucky!
Akito: An entire set of all their light novels... That's worth a lot of money!
Gorou: Ugh... Um, excuse me, Ma'am, could we discuss this? I don't actually want the light novels.
Murata: Huh? You mean you want to give up the prize?
Paimon: Gorou! Don't give up your prize! If you don't want to see Miko, that's fine — we'll figure something out!
Gorou: No, that's not what I meant. I'm not giving up the prize, and I can cope with the ceremony and the picture-taking.
Gorou: But I have a request. I would like to ask Yae Publishing House to change the prize from light novels to books on agricultural science of equivalent value.
Paimon: Agricultural science?
Gorou: Yes. The land in Watatsumi Island is quite barren and always yields a poor grain harvest. We've been looking for new ways to improve the residents' lives.
Gorou: One of Her Ex... Sole of the Deep's core objectives for the Irodori Festival was to purchase some works on crop cultivation and aquaculture.
Gorou: If I can get these books as my prize instead, we can save a lot of money, and Sole of the Deep can buy some other useful resources, too.
Murata: I see. I understand your request, but I don't have the authority to grant it. Lady Yae will have to have the final say.
Murata: I will contact Lady Yae now — please wait for our reply at The Five Kasen Plaza. Depending on the situation, Lady Yae might need to negotiate this matter with you further in person.
Gorou: Okay, understood.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Gorou, that was pretty brave of you. You clearly don't like having to deal with Miko, but you still agreed to the ceremony and even made your own demands.
Gorou: You think so? I guess I got a burst of courage when I thought about Her Excellency's orders and the people of Watatsumi Island.
Gorou: I am the general of Watatsumi Island's armed forces. How can I let something like this defeat me?
Gorou: I'm ready now. I feel like I'm back on the battlefield. Even if Yae Miko does come to negotiate with me, I won't let myself be pressured by her.
Gorou: ...
Paimon: You still look pretty nervous, though, Gorou.
Gorou: Haha... well, probably because I just realized she might make a cunning counter-request just to toy with me.
Murata: Sorry for keeping you all waiting.
Gorou: How did it go? What did Guuji Yae say?
Murata: Lady Yae has agreed to your request to swap the light novels for books on agricultural science.
Paimon: That's great.
Murata: Additionally, Lady Yae says that she will include a few extra works, considering your intended use for those books.
Murata: You may accompany me to Yae Publishing House's warehouse to select your preferred books. I believe your return ship leaves tomorrow night? We will package the selected books and take them directly onto the ship for you.
Gorou: You'll package the books? Then, what about the ceremony?
Murata: Lady Yae said selecting the books may take up a lot of your time and energy. To ensure you have fond memories of the Irodori Festival, she decided to cancel the ceremony.
Murata: Although, she did leave you a letter. You can read it in your own time.
Gorou: I didn't think Yae Miko would cancel the ceremony. Huh, I was so convinced that she would try and make a fool out of me. Now it seems like I was overly suspicious of her.
Gorou: Anyway, I'll go with the editor to pick the books now. I won't trouble you guys anymore.
Traveler: See you tomorrow night, Gorou.
Gorou: Great. See you tomorrow night.
Traveler: We'll see you off at the harbor.

## Talk 8

Sangonomiya Kokomi: #Traveler, Paimon, thank you for coming to see us off.
Traveler: How was your trip to Ritou?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Very worthwhile. The book review session was a big success, and I feel very positive about the forthcoming talks.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Gorou also made a great contribution. He procured a whole batch of useful books for Watatsumi Island.
Gorou: I may have won the prize, but ultimately it was Yae Miko who gave us all these books for free. If I have the chance in the future, I must thank her properly.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Speaking of, didn't Yae Miko send you a letter yesterday? What did it say?
Gorou: Oh, I almost forgot! I'll read it now...
Yae Miko: Dear Gorou, I suppose you must have been extremely nervous when you heard about the prospect of the award ceremony and the photo.
Yae Miko: It came as a surprise indeed to learn that not only did you accept those conditions, you also made your own demands. Your courage has won my respect.
Yae Miko: Those books are a token of my goodwill to Watatsumi Island, and also my gift to you. I do hope you like them.
Yae Miko: Ah yes, I'm sure that by this point you must be feeling ever so grateful for my kindness and are looking for a way to repay me, yes? Well, here's your chance.
Yae Miko: Yae Publishing House will host an event next month, and we are looking for someone to dress up as a character from a light novel and interact with the fans.
Yae Miko: Gorou, you are not only patient but also very beautiful. Why don't you come and help us? I'll prepare a tailor-made outfit, just for you.
Yae Miko: Oh, and by the way — it'll be a woman's outfit.
Gorou: Aaaaah!!! I knew it, I knew she was up to something!
