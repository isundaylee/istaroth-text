## Talk

Jala: How about it, Honorary Knight and Helper in White? Catching some pre-corralled fish should be as easy as... Well, shooting fish in a barrel, right?
Traveler: Let's start fishing and cooking!
Jala: You two look raring to go... let's see what you've got!
Traveler: We'll shoot those fish up real good!
Paimon: But... Paimon has a question. You mentioned a bunch of "merchants who hold strange beliefs." What's their deal?
Paimon: They're the ones who caused this mess. They should be the ones in the barrel right now!
Jala: Those guys... I wouldn't call most of them malicious. Just overly naive...
Jala: ...Who trusted this rumor: "Release some animals into the wild before you do anything important. It will bring you good fortune!"
Jala: People like that have spread from Sumeru to regions all over Teyvat, calling themselves "The Unchained." Some merchants caught the scent of the business opportunity at hand...
Jala: ...And they started smuggling various animals from all over and used strange feed to make them look more beautiful, before selling them off to members of The Unchained at exorbitant prices.
Paimon: That's crazy! What sort of people would fall for that?
Jala: The same sort who'd fall for something as silly as "releasing animals brings you good fortune," that's who.
Jala: The way some see it, releasing more expensive or beautiful animals accumulates more "merit."
Traveler: If they're so eager to part with their Mora, I'm right here.
Paimon: Geez, all that Mora down the drain for nothing— no, less than nothing, considering the trouble they've caused others! The only ones who profited are those scummy merchants!
Jala: Don't worry. An officer from the Maison Gardiennage is following the clues I provided to track down those charlatans. We'll know the outcome soon enough.
Jala: We won't need you two to personally catch the culprits this time, Honorary Knight and Helper in White!
Traveler: And if it's worthy, convincing causes they need, I'm right here.
Paimon: #That's right! Giving Traveler Mora guarantees you some help with your problem, at least!
Traveler: Putting that aside, have we met before?
Paimon: #Right! You're dressed like you're from Sumeru, but you called Traveler Honorary Knight, and Paimon the Helper in White, which is what the people in Mondstadt say...
Jala: Ah, right. I understand your confusion.
Jala: Everyone in Mondstadt says you two can do the work of seven, eight, or even ten people in one day, so you must've met many fascinating people on your travels. By contrast, I doubt you'd remember someone like me, no matter how sharp your mind—
Jala: A long time ago, I too believed that releasing animals could bring me fortune. When I was in Mondstadt for business, I released some invasive fish from Sumeru into Cider Lake and caused a whole lot of trouble...
Traveler: So that was you!
Paimon: Oh! You were having a picnic at Cider Lake back then, weren't you?
Jala: That's right. After encountering you two there, I realized my error and accepted the punishment I deserved.
Jala: Fortunately, the situation wasn't yet unsalvageable, and the good people in the Knights of Favonius managed to fix my mess, but the dread stuck with me...
Jala: After returning to Sumeru, I tried to warn those who habitually released animals. Some were willing to listen, some ignored me, and some started antagonizing me.
Jala: As someone who messed up badly in the past, I can't bear to see others repeat my mistakes...
Jala: So I read up more on the subject and worked with relevant organizations within the Akademiya to help the "Corps of Thirty" track down The Unchained and those crooked merchants alike.
Jala: The latter are active in many nations, so I've been traveling a lot. This time, as you can see, my quarry is a Fontainian.
Jala: I have the relevant documents and proof from the Akademiya on hand. The Maison Gardiennage also has a record of similar cases in the past. And considering how I've hit it off with the local officers, we'll have the culprit behind bars in no time.
Traveler: Congratulations on turning things around!
Paimon: From someone who made mistakes to someone who stops others from making them... Paimon's seeing you in a whole new way, Jala!
Jala: Well, I couldn't have done it without your help.
Jala: The Maison Gardiennage has paid me a considerable commission for this. Since traveling expenses are all I need, I'll leave the rest to you two as a token of my gratitude!
Traveler: A little brutal, but well played!
Traveler: That's not ringing any bells...
Paimon: Paimon kinda remembers an incident of that sort...
Jala: Well, the details are best left in the past anyway. So, after meeting you two, I saw the error of my ways and accepted the punishment I deserved.
Traveler: I've got something else to do right now...
Jala: No worries! I'm sure you'll settle this in no time, even if you do only show up later!
