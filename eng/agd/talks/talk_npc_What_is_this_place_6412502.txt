Traveler: What is this place?
Nesmil: This is Djafar Tavern, the best in Port Ormos! Our boss here can get hold of any good wine!
Nesmil: Nearby merchants, tourists, sailors... and my old friends from the Eremites all come here to indulge in drinking from time to time.
Nesmil: And there's also the tasty appetizers. Personally, I think you can have them as meals, even without drinks!
