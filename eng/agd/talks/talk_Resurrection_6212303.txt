Traveler: Resurrection?
Jiu: The adepti thought to suppress it with trees. Hah! Fools! Little did they know that after thousands of years... the trees that hold the beast shall surely become one with the beast...
Jiu: And lo, it shall stretch wide its arms, and unfurl its body, and reach out with its roots... And the ley lines of the world shall heed its call.
Jiu: Then, once the beast has quenched its great thirst for that energy which only the ley lines can provide...
Jiu: I imagine any significance we presume to have in this world will vanish for good. Wouldn't you agree?
