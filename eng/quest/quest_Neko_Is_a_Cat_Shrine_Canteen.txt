# Neko Is a Cat: Shrine Canteen


## Talk 1

Neko: This is... quite incredible...
Traveler: Is the stone carving done?
Neko: When we began, that stone did not look a thing like me. But with each passing glance, it becomes more and more so.
Neko: You humans really are incredible.
Neko: It is very noisy, yes, but I am the provisional head priestess. Such trivial matters are not worth complaining about.
Neko: Bring these fish to that tall human.
Neko: They are good things, and may be considered his... "celery."
Traveler: Just fish?
Neko: Meow, I did get Konbumaru to lead those children to try to catch some finches, but it did not turn out very well.
Neko: For them, catching fish is still simpler.
Traveler: It's "salary."
Neko: Meow meow meow, how bothersome of you.
Neko: Just give them to him â€” they are good things, after all.

## Talk 2

Ooshima Junpei: Well, this certainly looks the part now...
Ooshima Junpei: Haha, it's you. Do you think it looks a bit more like the Lady Priestess now?
Traveler: It sure does.
Ooshima Junpei: Right? Ah, I spent a few days burning the midnight oil on this, too...
Ooshima Junpei: Ah, I'm pretty hungry, I think... Time to go look for something to eat again...
Traveler: Neko sends you some fish.
Ooshima Junpei: Hmm, well, the Lady Priestess has my thanks, but uh... I think I'll look for food on my own...
Ooshima Junpei: I've eaten fish for several straight days now. I don't think I could eat any more...
Ooshima Junpei: I've been heading out to forage for food. When I'm lucky, I can grab a finch or a pigeon...
Ooshima Junpei: *sigh* But what I'd like to have is some meat, you know? Some firm, juicy meat...
Ooshima Junpei: So, uh, Traveler...
Ooshima Junpei: If you don't mind, could you get me three servings of Raw Meat?
Ooshima Junpei: I'm no good at hunting, so I haven't been able to get any meat these past few days... So please, give me a hand!
Traveler: Alright...
Ooshima Junpei: Please help me out. Just three servings will do!
Traveler: Did you think of going back to Narukami Island to have a meal?
Ooshima Junpei: Well, it's really far away, for one thing. And for another... I was just getting the hang of this carving. If I'd left at this point, the journey might have deprived me of that "feeling," see.
Ooshima Junpei: I'd prefer to eat a quick meal here before continuing to carve.
Traveler: It's a lot larger, that's for sure.
Ooshima Junpei: Well, of course. The Lady Priestess is quite a bit larger than your average cat, but if you want a more majestic statue, then it's got to be even larger still. This is a shrine statue, after all!

## Talk 3

Ooshima Junpei: Ooh... the marbling... Thank you both so much!
Ooshima Junpei: I'll whip up a few good dishes in just a moment. With any luck, I might even finish my carving faster after eating, haha!
Traveler: What do the two have in common, again?
Ooshima Junpei: Eating some good meat gives you the strength to keep going! It just wasn't the same with those fish. I couldn't help but feel like my hands were too weak for the work...
Ooshima Junpei: Honestly, I was starting to get worried that I might take longer than expected to finish the whole statue. Well, that's not a problem now, thanks to you!
Ooshima Junpei: I mean, I am being employed by a... cat, sure, but one should always avoid asking for extensions.
Ooshima Junpei: Whatever the case, I'll get this one done as soon as I can... Come to think of it, the Lady Priestess said that once the statue is completed, something good will happen.
Ooshima Junpei: I'm not sure what that means exactly, but well... I'm quite looking forward to it, actually.
Ooshima Junpei: Come back in a while and have a look at the final product.

## Talk 4

Ooshima Junpei: How did it go? Were you able to get the Raw Meat?
