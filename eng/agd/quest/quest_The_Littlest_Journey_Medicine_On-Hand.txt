# The Littlest Journey: Medicine On-Hand


## Talk 1

Little Meng: Traveler, great timing! I was just looking to ask you something.
Traveler: What's the matter?
Little Meng: He said that the journey is going to be a long one, and that we'll need some medicine.
Little Meng: Stuff for headaches, diarrhea, heatstroke, hangovers, stuff to help digestion... There's just a lot.
Paimon: Actually, why do they need stuff for hangovers...
Traveler: It's probably for business negotiations.
Paimon: Eh? What does hangover medicine have to do with business deals? It's not like business will boom the more you can drink, right?
Little Meng: Whatever the case, Dad wants me to go to Bubu Pharmacy to ask if the medicines have been prepared yet.
Little Meng: Could you accompany me there? There's something I'd like to ask you for help with.
Traveler: Let's go, then.
Little Meng: C'mon, let's go!
Traveler: What's the thing you need help with?
Little Meng: We'll talk about it when we get there.
Traveler: How are the preparations going?
Little Meng: Well, it's mostly Dad and his friends preparing... But Dad's also given me a task!

## Talk 2

Herbalist Gui: Welcome. Are you here to procure a herbal remedy?
Herbalist Gui: ...Little Meng? What brings you here today?
Herbalist Gui: ...Oh, right. I remember now. You're here about those medicines, yes?
Herbalist Gui: Don't worry, they're almost all ready. I'll send them to your father in batches.
Herbalist Gui: That said, his order has drained our reserves of herbs, so some of those medicines will only be ready later.
Herbalist Gui: Let me see... Well, the main thing we're low on is Mint, which has put a stop on heatstroke medicine production for now.
Herbalist Gui: I mean, we are also taking medicine orders other than your father's...
Little Meng: Then...
Traveler: Looks like it's my time to shine.
Little Meng: Hehe, thanks, Traveler!
Little Meng: I'm counting on you to get those herbs! I've got to stay here in the meantime and check those medicines, just like Dad asked me to!
Herbalist Gui: Haha, aren't you an earnest kid?
Herbalist Gui: Alright then, right this way. I'll go through this batch of medicines with you in detail.
Little Meng: Whoa, that's... a lot...
Herbalist Gui: Have a look at these first. I'll bring the next batch out shortly.
Little Meng: Eh? There's more!?
Traveler: Just don't forget to pay me, now.
Little Meng: Hehe, no problem! Thanks, Traveler!

## Talk 3

Little Meng: Traveler, have you found the Mint?

## Talk 4

Little Meng: Thank you!
Herbalist Gui: Yes, these will be enough for me to make some medicine with.
Herbalist Gui: I'll put the heatstroke medicine into the next batch and have them delivered to you.
Little Meng: Thanks, Big Brother Gui!
Little Meng: And these are for you, Traveler. Thanks for your help! Let's head back now, shall we?
Little Meng: Hehe, Dad will be pleased to hear this, I'm sure of it...
Herbalist Gui: One moment please, Little Meng.
Little Meng: Eh? What is it?
Herbalist Gui: Weren't you supposed to check the medicines? You still haven't gone through the checklists in the back.
Little Meng: Eh... What? I... But I was checking for so long...
Herbalist Gui: And there's more where that came from, Little Meng. Now then, let's continue the reviewing process...
Little Meng: Wah... Okay...

## Talk 5

Herbalist Gui: I need to review this checklist as well...
