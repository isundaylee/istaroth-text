# A Soul Set Apart


## Talk 1

Paimon: Dain, there you are. Did you see Master Jean?
Dainsleif: I saw her, but purposely avoided her.
Dainsleif: As both the Lionfang Knight and Acting Grand Master, she naturally would have some reservations towards me.
Dainsleif: If I'm not careful, one day I may find myself becoming the object of one of her investigations.
Dainsleif: But back to the matter at hand... I defeated some of the Abyss forces but wasn't able to gather any information. Did you have more success?
Dainsleif: I see...
Dainsleif: Well then. We can more or less figure out where the first Field Tiller ended up.
Paimon: Huh? Really? Just from the Lupus Boreas story?
Dainsleif: That information combined with a more comprehensive analysis.
Dainsleif: For example, the old story you told me you heard in the Cathedral...
Traveler: "The Tyrant's Final Fury"!
Dainsleif: Exactly, the strange story told to you by that young sister, long mistaken to be a curse rained down by a deceased tyrant.
Traveler: The fireballs raining from the sky were probably missiles...
Paimon: Ah, Paimon gets it! So "The Tyrant's Final Fury" was really just missiles fired from the Field Tiller after it ran from Wolvendom!
Paimon: After it was damaged in the fight with the Wolf of the North, it must have wandered into the ruins of Old Mondstadt and stayed there...
Paimon: Then, whenever anyone got close — PEW, PEW, BOOM! It would fire a ton of missiles at them... Until one day, it finally broke down for good, and the fireballs stopped raining from the sky.
Paimon: Back then, the people of Mondstadt hadn't seen many Ruin Guards before, so they came to interpret it as "The Tyrant's Final Fury"!
Dainsleif: It looks like we need to make a trip to <color=#00E1FFFF>Stormterror's Lair</color> and comb the entire area.
Traveler: No.
Dainsleif: Hmm. What do you mean...?
Traveler: I... I remember.
Paimon: Huh? You mean...
Paimon: Ohh, Paimon remembers, too! We saw that abandoned <color=#00E1FFFF>Ruin Guard sitting atop the tower</color> when we went there before! Can't forget something like that!
Traveler: No need.
Traveler: The ancient people of Mondstadt wouldn't have seen the fireballs for what they were...
Traveler: Actually, Barbara's the deaconess...

## Talk 2

Paimon: They... left...
Paimon: #Oh, don't be too sad, {NICKNAME}... We'll find them again! Look on the bright side, at least we got some really useful information!
Traveler: I'm... not sad.
Paimon: Really? You sure...?
Paimon: At least now, as well as The Seven, Dain is also a key part of finding your sibling too, right?
Traveler: Once we get to Inazuma, we should keep that in mind as we look for more clues.
Paimon: That's right! Um... by the way, what they said just now was all pretty confusing... Did you understand it at all?
Traveler: I pretty much got it.
Paimon: Oh... well then... let's go over it again.
Paimon: #First off, that Abyss Herald called {F#your brother "Prince."}{M#your sister "Princess."}
Paimon: #It seems like your {F#brother}{M#sister} is leading the Abyss Order, even the Abyss Herald answers to {F#him}{M#her}... Still, we don't know for sure if {F#he's}{M#she's} the highest-ranking leader in the organization.
Paimon: #Also, your {F#brother}{M#sister} said that {F#he}{M#she} wants to "engulf the thrones" and go to "war with destiny." What the heck does that mean? ...Could it be {F#he}{M#that she} wants to destroy The Seven and the seven nations?
Paimon: Next thing... turns out the Abyss Order monsters are really what the people of Khaenri'ah turned into after their nation was destroyed. This story is just plain terrifying!
Paimon: And Dain is from Khaenri'ah, too! He witnessed its destruction 500 years ago. But... he didn't turn into a monster, and now he's fighting the Abyss Order...
Paimon: #So that's why {F#your brother}{M#your sister} said that Dain is {F#his}{M#her} enemy, right?
Paimon: But... If the monsters of the Abyss are the same people that Dain protected all those years ago, then why is he enemies with the Abyss Order now?
Paimon: #Also, how come... after all this time we've spent searching for {F#your brother}{M#your sister}, it turns out {F#he's}{M#she's} on the side of the Abyss. What's up with that?
Traveler: We have many new questions, but few answers.
Paimon: Yeah, you're right.
Paimon: #Then... we can't let ourselves get down about it now, {NICKNAME}!
Paimon: Our journey's not over yet, let's get a move on! Time to leave this terrible, dark place and get back to the surface, where the sun shines bright.
Paimon: #If your {F#brother}{M#sister} wants you to "reach the end of your journey"... {F#Show him}{M#Well then, show her} what you're made of!
Paimon: Come on, Traveler, let's go!
Traveler: Thinking about it over and over will solve nothing.
Traveler: #I was too focused on {F#my brother}{M#Lumine} to really listen carefully.
Traveler: Another objective for our journey.
Traveler: You're right, Paimon. There is hope.
Paimon: Uh-huh, that's right!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Hey, c—could that be...!?
Traveler: #{F#Aether}{M#Lumine}!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): #{F#Lumine}{M#Aether}...
Traveler: I've finally found you!
Paimon: #W—Wait, {NICKNAME}... {F#He}{M#She} just blocked an attack against the Abyss Herald...
Paimon: #Your {F#brother}{M#sister}, and the Abyss...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): #{F#Lumine}{M#Aether}, why are you with Dain?
Traveler: ...What?
Traveler: (We've been separated for so long...)
Paimon: Huh?
Paimon: #Your {F#brother}{M#sister}... knows Dain, {NICKNAME}?
Dainsleif: ...
Dainsleif: #{F#Aether}{M#Lumine}. We meet again.
Paimon: #Wh—What's going on here? Dain knows {F#him}{M#her}, too!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): You shouldn't team up with this man.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): He is my enemy.
Dainsleif: #{F#Aether}{M#Lumine}...
Traveler: Hold on a second!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): ...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): But it must be said... Don't try to stop me. Don't try to stop the Abyss.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): That man, Dainsleif, was the "Twilight Sword," one of the royal guards of the final dynasty of Khaenri'ah. 500 years ago, he failed to prevent the destruction of Khaenri'ah.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): #A curse of immortality was laid upon him, to forever wander the wilderness... while he watched the people he was supposed to protect turn into {F#the monsters}{M#monsters} of the Abyss.
Paimon: You're saying... Dain is from Khaenri'ah!? The same Khaenri'ah that was destroyed 500 years ago!?
Paimon: And you said the people turned into monsters... You're trying to tell Paimon that the Abyss Order is not only related to Khaenri'ah but is actually the people of Khaenri'ah themselves!?
Paimon: Uh... and the whole thing about Dain being your enemy? Ohh... Paimon's so confused...
Traveler: #Come with me, {F#Aether}{M#Lumine}! Let's go home!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): Home...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): Yes, of course. "Home" is wherever we are together.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): But I cannot go with you to the next world to find a new home... at least, not yet.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): Until the Abyss has engulfed the thrones, my war with destiny will see no end...
Traveler: Destiny...?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): #Listen to me, {F#Lumine}{M#Aether}.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): I have already traveled through this world once. Once you reach the end of your journey as I did, you will see for yourself the true nature of this world.
Traveler: You can tell me all this later. Let's go home!
Traveler: #Stop saying things that don't make sense, {F#Aether}{M#Lumine}!
Traveler: (Why are you asking about something that doesn't matter...?)
Traveler: You're asking about... Dain?
Traveler: Let's get out of here, it's too dangerous!

## Talk 4

Paimon: This is it, right? Okay then, use your Elemental Sight to look for the eye!
Paimon: Ooooh... So what did you see?
Paimon: Huh? ...Nothing? But Paimon was so excited...
Paimon: What's going on...? Are you sure you did it right?
Dainsleif: This requires another method.
Dainsleif: Using Elemental Sight on a Field Tiller is of no use because it is not powered by the elements.
Dainsleif: Let me give it a try.
Dainsleif: ...And done.
Paimon: Wowwww! It's, it's the...!
Dainsleif: The very thing the Abyss Herald has been seeking all along — the eye of the first Field Tiller.
Dainsleif: All of the Ruin Guards today are just replicas of this machine. As the prototype, its combat capability was unrestricted.
Paimon: "Prototype"? ...Paimon doesn't know that word, is it another ancient term from Khaenri'ah?
Dainsleif: As the Abyss Order has surmised, if this eye is placed in the hands of the Defiled Statue...
Dainsleif: And if the limbs of Osial, Overlord of the Vortex, are attached to the statue... there you have a mechanized god.
Dainsleif: And this newly born god will have the power to "topple the divine thrones of Celestia."
Traveler: What an extreme and dangerous operation.
Dainsleif: Yes.
Paimon: Th—Then... What should we do with this eye?
Traveler: Hide it somewhere no one will find it.
Dainsleif: No. I'll guard it myself.
Paimon: Huh!? You!? Dain... You won't go and do anything crazy with it, will you?
Dainsleif: You may doubt me if you wish, but I must ensure it does not fall into the wrong hands.
Dainsleif: No matter where we may hide it, they will find it. And as for the Church of Favonius — well, you know I don't trust them.
Paimon: Oh, hehe... right...
Dainsleif: But our work isn't done yet. To avoid any further repercussions, we must also take care of that Defiled Statue.
Traveler: By doing what, exactly?
Dainsleif: We can't have the Church get involved. Let's handle it ourselves. As for what I mean by take care of it... naturally, I mean to completely destroy it.
Paimon: D—Destroy it!? That's a Statue of The Seven! As well as being a really important cultural relic, they're actually divine, too...
Paimon: Ugh, well, good thing we didn't tell Barbara earlier. Otherwise, she'd be going completely bonkers right now!
Dainsleif: Hmph... Do The Seven really expect me to help them look after what belongs to them?
Dainsleif: Let's go back to <color=#00E1FFFF>those ruins</color> and destroy the inverted statue. If we are lucky, we will also run into that Abyss Herald.
Dainsleif: I'll make sure it doesn't get away this time.
Traveler: Can we let the Church take care of this one?
Traveler: Put it under the guardianship of the Church of Favonius.
Traveler: The Abyss Order must be stopped.

## Talk 5

Paimon: So, after all that running around, we end up right back here again...
Paimon: Look at us... We barely escaped this place last time, and now we're strolling right back in!
Paimon: Gee, surely we must be some of the bravest adventurers in all of Teyvat! That or the stupidest...

## Talk 6

Dainsleif: Looks like we're here.
Dainsleif: An eerie, lifeless, dark chamber... I understand the evil aura you were describing earlier.
Paimon: Ohhhh... Such a scary place...
Dainsleif: Be careful to not be overwhelmed by the power of the Defiled Statue— the Abyss Herald, it's here.
Abyss Herald: Mwahaha... You sense correctly.
Abyss Herald: You are just as vexatious as ever, Dainsleif, enemy of the Abyss!
Abyss Herald: I sense your soul is stained by terrible bloodshed, perhaps from your darkest nightmares. Unless... Huh?
Abyss Herald: Oh, and something far more dangerous! You reek of a corruption familiar to me...
Abyss Herald: Then we are the same. We're both dangerous. But dangers from outside of the Abyss Order must be caught and caged...
Dainsleif: Tsk.
Dainsleif: It is your words that forever reek of corruption...
Dainsleif: Time to silence you!
