Dori: If there really was such a thing as a miracle potion that could cure all disease, I'm sure it would be auctioned off and sold for an astronomical price.
Dori: But in this fairytale, the fairy gives her magic potion to the prince for free. She has no business sense at all.
Dori: *sigh* If you want my opinion... Praying to a fairy isn't the answer. Better to go out and make some Mora.
