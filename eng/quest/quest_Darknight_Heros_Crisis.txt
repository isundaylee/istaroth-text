# Darknight Hero's Crisis


## Talk 1

Paimon: Huffman!
Huffman: Oh, it's you two. Thank you for coming.
Huffman: So — the Darknight Hero. Do you have anything else you're able to share with me?
Traveler: Could I first ask what's going on?
Huffman: Ah yes, of course I should fill you in first... apologies for my appalling lapse of etiquette.
Huffman: The situation is... here. Take a look at this.
Paimon: Geez... what horrible handwriting!
Paimon: Hmm, let me take a closer look... Huh, some parts of this seem to be complete gibberish.
Huffman: Indeed. Although this is written in the common tongue, it appears that a cipher has been used in many places.
Huffman: Nevertheless, one can grasp the general message from the non-ciphered portions alone...
Huffman: This is a war declaration from the Abyss Order to the Darknight Hero.
Paimon: Does that mean... the bad guys want the Darknight Hero to go away forever and ever?
Huffman: Something like that. Thus, we are hoping to contact him as soon as possible so that we can attempt to coordinate a response.
Huffman: After all, this matter no longer concerns merely the Darknight Hero himself. It impacts the entire city of Mondstadt.
Traveler: Thank you for the information.
Huffman: If you find out anything at all, come and find me.
Traveler: I will keep it in mind.
Traveler: Sorry, we've got nothing.
Huffman: Is that so... That is a pity indeed.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Master Diluc! Just now we were at the Knights of Favonius and, and—
Diluc: I take it you're about to inform me of the war declaration from the Abyss Order?
Diluc: I am aware of it. Though I appreciate you for taking the trouble to come all this way.
Paimon: What?
Diluc: The Dawn Winery's intelligence network extends beyond commercial matters.
Paimon: Great! So, what's the plan, Master Diluc?
Diluc: I'm open to suggestions...
Traveler: You really should join forces with the Knights...
Diluc: No. That would be playing right into the hands of the Abyss Order.
Diluc: They know full well that we don't exactly see eye to eye. They're using this as a means to force me into making an appearance.
Diluc: If my identity were exposed, all my future activities would be subject to some degree of interference from the Knights.
Diluc: After all, no powerful organization wishes to be outdone by someone from the outside.
Paimon: Whew... the Abyss Order has really dealt you a tough hand this time. What a sneaky little bunch those guys are!
Diluc: There is a way. But for it to work, I need some more information.
Diluc: Specifically, I need to decipher the obscured portions of the Abyss Order's war declaration.
Paimon: Obscured portions? You mean the bits Paimon can't read?
Diluc: It must be a cipher only understood by members of the Abyss Order, used to spread messages within the organization.
Traveler: Why would they send you a written message that only they can read?
Diluc: It's not simply a war declaration, but also a notification to their own.
Diluc: When you take a stand that makes you a hero to one party, you also become a villain to the other.
Diluc: And since I've been the Abyss Order's enemy for so long...
Diluc: They've made me the target around which they can rally their troops and unite their strength.
Paimon: Wow... Seems like it takes a lot of brains to be a superhero, huh?
Diluc: I understand my enemy well is all. As the saying goes, heroes and villains are two sides of the same coin.
Paimon: So what're we gonna do about the intel that's written in gibberish then? How do we... ungibberishify it?
Diluc: Simple. When you don't understand something, you ask.
Diluc: I've already tracked down one of their <color=#00E1FFFF>strongholds</color>... If you're interested, feel free to come along.
Traveler: If they knew we can't read it, why did they write it in the first place?
Traveler: Stay at the winery until this blows over.
Diluc: That would be tantamount to handing this over to the Knights.
Diluc: Had they been worthy of this task to begin with, things would never have escalated to this point.
Diluc: In any case, circumstances are not dire enough to warrant me going into hiding and leaving the Knights to deal with the consequences.

## Talk 3

Diluc: This is the place.
Diluc: Abandoned ruins like these are precisely the kind of place the Abyss Order likes to camp out.
Diluc: Come on. There's no time to lose.

## Talk 4

Interrogate: How did you find me here!? Favonian scum!
Diluc: I am no Knight of Favonius. Now, start talking! Your plan, what is it?
Interrogate: I see you received our letter... But if you think I'm going to let you in on our secrets, I'm afraid you're quite mistaken!
Diluc: Hmph. You appear to have misunderstood the situation you are in.
Traveler: Burn him with <color=#00E1FFFF>Searing Hand</color>!
Interrogate: D—Did you just use a Pyro Vision to shoot f—fire from your hands!? ...Aah! It burns!
Diluc: Let's see how long it takes for you to crack...
Traveler: Burn him with <color=#00E1FFFF>Searing Hand</color> again!
Interrogate: Stop! Stop! P—Please, the pain— I beg you... make it stop!
Traveler: Burn him with <color=#00E1FFFF>Searing Hand</color> again!
Interrogate: Ugh...
Diluc: Playing dead won't help you — that fire was nowhere near strong enough to— Oh... He seems to have <color=#00E1FFFF>passed out</color>...
Diluc: Hey! You sleep when I say you can sleep!
Interrogate: Aah! It burns!
Interrogate: I'll talk, I'll talk! Ow ow ow... P—Please, stop! I'll tell you <color=#00E1FFFF>everything</color>!
Interrogate: Th—The Abyss Order, we've amassed a force bound by a shared hatred for the Darknight Hero...
Interrogate: They... They will march on the Mondstadt <color=#00E1FFFF>city gates</color> at 10 PM tomorrow night.
Interrogate: That's everything I know... Please... Don't make me suffer those flames again...
Diluc: That's it? Well, I doubt you'd be foolish enough to keep anything else hidden.
Traveler: <color=#00E1FFFF>Interrogate him</color> about their plan of attack.

## Talk 5

Huffman: If we do not make contact with the Darknight Hero soon...
Traveler: What are we to do about the Abyss Order's challenge?
Huffman: Ah, it's you two. I must admit, this issue of the Darknight Hero is proving to be something of a headache.
Huffman: We've just held a meeting to decide on an appropriate course of action. Can you guess what it is?
Traveler: Bury our heads firmly in the sand?
Huffman: Haha... Good one. But no, the Knights cannot afford to simply stand by and watch while there is even the slightest inkling of a threat facing Mondstadt.
Huffman: If that were the case, more and more people would start to rely on the Darknight Hero instead of the Knights of Favonius.
Paimon: Oh. Well, what's the plan then?
Huffman: Find out the Darknight Hero's true identity, and offer him our protection.
Paimon: "Protection"? He seems to be doing just fine without your protection so far, y'know...
Huffman: Pff...
Huffman: Well, since you've aided the Knights in the past, I might as well just tell you.
Huffman: The offer of protection is just a ruse, in order for the Knights of Favonius to take over full — and exclusive — responsibility for this matter.
Paimon: You aren't gonna let the Darknight Hero be all heroic and stuff? Why not?
Huffman: Firstly, to show the might of the Knights of Favonius — to prove to the people that without the Darknight Hero, they can still rely on the Knights to maintain peace and harmony.
Huffman: Secondly, the Abyss Order have no mercy in their hearts. If anything happened to the Darknight Hero...
Huffman: It would only serve to further their nefarious ambitions.
Paimon: Gosh... Paimon never knew the life of a knight involved so much untold anguish before.
Huffman: But none of this will work if we don't establish the Darknight Hero's true identity in time.
Kaeya: There's no need to despair, Huffman. Just follow my plan and everything will be fine.
Huffman: Ah, Captain Kaeya.
Kaeya: Lately, Master Diluc has been working the bar at the Angel's Share every night.
Kaeya: All I need you to do is keep him in your sight. Think you can manage that for me?
Huffman: Yes, Captain Kaeya! ...But, does that mean that...
Huffman: Master Diluc is the Darknight Hero?
Kaeya: Who knows...? It's just a hunch. I've been known to be wrong on occasion.
Traveler: Join forces with the Darknight Hero?
Huffman: No. That would send a signal that the Knights are in favor of the Darknight Hero's continued presence in our city... which we are not.
Huffman: Encouraging this kind of individual heroism undermines the Knights' authority.

## Talk 6

Diluc: Now that I have the information I need, I must prepare.
Diluc: I would be grateful if you could keep me updated on how the Knights of Favonius respond to this matter.
Paimon: Yes, Master Diluc sir! Anything you say, Master Diluc sir!
Diluc: ...Why are you acting so strange all of a sudden?
Paimon: In... in light of what just went down here a moment ago...
Paimon: Master Diluc has officially reached No. 1 on Paimon's "people not to tick off under any circumstances" list...
Diluc: ...
