Traveler: Learning about me would cost you a fortune.
Jayant: Hahaha, I understand. Everyone has their own fate, none less precious than anybody else's.

Jayant: If my background were worse, I wouldn't be able to go on the streets and meet people from all walks of life.
Jayant: Anyway, you know where to find me. If you ever need a friend, I'm right here waiting.
