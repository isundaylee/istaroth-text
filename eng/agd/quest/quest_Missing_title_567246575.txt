# Missing title (567246575)

Paimon: Hey there, Jeht!
Jeht: #Traveler? And Paimon, too!
Benben: Beep beep!
Jeht: Haha, see what I told you? We'd meet again!
Traveler: What are you doing here?
Jeht: Well, that's a proper lady's little secret.
Paimon: ?
Jeht: #It means no probing! Even I wanna keep some things to myself, you know...
Jeht: #Pfft, sorry 'bout that, but according to the rules we've gotta follow as guards-for-hire, I can't tell you anything.
Paimon: Hmph, you sound all secretive!
Jeht: So... How have you been?
Traveler: Not bad.
Jeht: Yeah... The same with me.
Jeht: Alright, I won't keep you any longer. *sigh* I've got my own business to deal with.
Paimon: Huh, you're so busy, Jeht. You weren't like this before.
Jeht: Pfft... Well, that's a "stable" job for ya, though what I'm doing is pretty much the same as before.
Jeht: It really hasn't taken too long for me to start missing my old, carefree days...
Jeht: I don't know what you've been doing lately, but I always look forward to listening to your stories... and I've got plenty to share with you, too.
Jeht: But we're in no hurry. Good stories are like wine. Gotta let them age properly, you know? Travelers in the desert used to live on these stories once upon a time, hehe!
Jeht: Mm... Anyway, stay safe.
Traveler: You too, Jeht.
Jeht: Yeah, lemme give you a thousand hugs. I'll be praying for your safety.
Benben: Beep!
Jeht: Haha, Benben will be doing so too!
Traveler: I'm doing okay...
