Traveler: What are you doing here?
Ross the Quick: That's a good question... What AM I doing here...
Ross the Quick: I lost my way, then I got chased by a boar, then the hilichurls joined the chase...
Ross the Quick: I ran until my legs gave out and my energy was gone — then I suddenly noticed this lake...
Ross the Quick: Then I had this realization that I've spent my whole life running... running for no reason.
Ross the Quick: No matter what, right now I am going to give myself a proper rest. Screw missions and all that.
Ross the Quick: Although... There is the fact that if I don't report back to the gang soon, they'll fine me something like eight hundred thousand Mora... I forget how much exactly.
Ross the Quick: ...Whatever, screw the gang of thieves too!
Traveler: ...Y—You're from a gang of th—thieves!?
Ross the Quick: ...Hmm. Now you mention it, yes I am.
Ross the Quick: Originally my mission was to find this place called the Abandoned City.
Ross the Quick: ...But since I haven't reported back on my progress in so long, I've probably technically been kicked out of the gang by now.
Ross the Quick: That said, if you're gonna report me, I won't run away...
Ross the Quick: ...Either way, let me enjoy this view just a bit longer, won't you?
