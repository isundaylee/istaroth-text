Traveler: Isn't it good to have peace, though?
Uesugi: Ah, I didn't mean that... Of course I wish the residents peace. But something is bound to happen, isn't it?
Uesugi: I sometimes see the retainers of the Kamisato Clan going out for missions. And Ryuuji from the detective agency is often busy with cases. I always find it unsettling seeing how casual things can get at the Police Station.
Uesugi: As a Doushin of the Police Station, trying my best to take care of everyone's issues should be my job, right?
Uesugi: As such, I sometimes also work with Ryuuji to handle some cases. That sense of accomplishment when we finish a case is something that you don't get from working at the Police Station, hehe.
