### Additional Talk 1

Klee: Hey Kaeya, you promised to tell me the story about the Jinni-in-a-bottle if I didn't run off. Remember?
Kaeya: Ah, yes. Alright, where did I leave off...?
Klee: Oh, I remember! The Jinni came out, and was going to eat the shepherd boy who opened the bottle.
Kaeya: Right, as the Jinni opened its wide, menacing mouth, the shepherd boy suddenly had an idea.
Klee: Did he throw a Jumpy Dumpty into the Jinni's mouth?
Kaeya: Haha, I'm sure that's what he would have done if he had a Jumpy Dumpty.
Kaeya: But the shepherd boy didn't have anything like that.
Kaeya: He said to the Jinni, "Wait, how could your massive body fit inside such a small bottle? I won't ever believe it unless I see with my own eyes!"
Kaeya: The Jinni became angry, and said, "Mwahaha. Foolish boy, you dare question my powers!?"
Kaeya: The Jinni then returned inside the bottle and the boy swiftly sealed it shut.
Klee: Yay! That mean Jinni won't ever come out again!
Klee: But, can the Jinni sleep inside such a tiny bottle? It's probably not very comfortable...
Kaeya: No, but the Jinni was captured and sealed away in the bottle because it did many bad things.
Kaeya: So the most important thing to remember is, if you do something bad and don't want to get locked up, then don't get caught.

### Additional Talk 2

Collei: Klee said that they discovered some mysterious tracks that you can ride on using a "super fun Choo-Choo Cart."
Eula: Ah, I heard something about that, too. Apparently it's a cart that goes zipping along a "terrifying" course at an "uncontrollable" speed...
Collei: Yeah, that should be the one. It seems that when the cart rolls down a steep drop, your body would start floating as if it was weightless.
Eula: Really? Huh, I heard that Klee's bag almost flew away on the ride. If Kaeya hadn't managed to quickly catch it, countless Jumpy Dumpties would have been thrown into the air.
Collei: Oh no, that sounds pretty dangerous...
Eula: *sigh* But, if you really want to go for a ride, I'll accompany you if I have time.
Collei: Huh? But Eula, how did you know...
Eula: I could tell that you wanted to try it... But let me make this clear, I won't be helping you pick up anything that flies out during the ride. So make sure you take everything out of your pockets beforehand.
Collei: Ah, yes, of course!

### Additional Talk 3

Idyia: Who would have known I'd find myself in such a mess... Ugh, after all that talk with Alice about letting her daughter visit, too...
Idyia: But, just as the General said... If we can restore the domain, then...

### Additional Talk 4

Sangonomiya Kokomi: Uh, what was it that I said at the end of our ride in the Choo-Choo Cart? Something about fish in the sky and stars in the water? Oh my...
