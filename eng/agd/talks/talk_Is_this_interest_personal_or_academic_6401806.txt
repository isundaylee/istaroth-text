Traveler: Is this interest personal or academic?
Kimiya: Ahem... Can't it be both?
Kimiya: When I said that "legends hold that this was invented by Lesser Lord Kusanali," my mentor did have a doubtful look, but I didn't get rejected outright, so I reckon that it's too early to give up yet!
Kimiya: I just need to work out some rationale for this interpretation, even if it's a flimsy one. Then I can go back and discuss it with my mentor!
