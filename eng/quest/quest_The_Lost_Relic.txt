# The Lost Relic


## Talk 1

Bao'er: Where did it go...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Bao'er: I was investigating a ruin, when suddenly monsters attacked me...
Bao'er: I panicked and ran, and must have dropped the relic I'd just uncovered right where I found it.
Bao'er: After the monsters left, I came back, but I couldn't find the relic.
Bao'er: I've searched all over the place and I just can't find it. I wonder if maybe the monsters took it?
Bao'er: Can you help me search for it? If you find it, you can store it in this box.

## Talk 2

Bao'er: Where did it go...
Traveler: This box is... a bit...
Bao'er: Hey! Take a closer look, I think you'll find I've padded it with plenty of clothes.
Bao'er: I'm a professional scholar, don't you know! I don't make rookie errors.
Bao'er: Anyway, thanks for helping me look for the relic — I'd be useless in a fight with those monsters...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Hmm... We've looked everywhere — and still, nothing.
Paimon: Do you wanna keep looking? Or go back and check with Bao'er?
Traveler: Let's keep looking.
Paimon: Alright then. This time with your eyes open.
Traveler: Let's head back.
Paimon: Yeah, let's see what else Bao'er has to say.

## Talk 4

Bao'er: Did you find the relic?
Traveler: Yes.
Bao'er: Let me see... Wow! That's a relic, alright...
Bao'er: Um... It doesn't look like the one I lost, though. Still, looks valuable to me!
Bao'er: This relic needs looking after by an expert. Don't worry, it's safe with me... Hehehe... Thank you both.
