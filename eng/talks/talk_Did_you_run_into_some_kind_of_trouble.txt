Traveler: Did you run into some kind of trouble?
Chan Baatjan: Thank you for the kind words, my friend.
Chan Baatjan: I'm not in trouble or anything. This is just something that's been on my mind.
Chan Baatjan: Yilong Wharf faces Lumidouce Harbor, and so we receive a lot of merchants from Fontaine. In time, this place has become a melting pot of cultures and cuisines.
Chan Baatjan: Some chefs had never had Fontainian food, and praised it to the high heavens upon first tasting its novelty.
Chan Baatjan: Some chefs grew arrogant, on the other hand, when they saw that Fontainian diners loved Liyue's food, so they started claiming that Liyue has the best food anywhere.
