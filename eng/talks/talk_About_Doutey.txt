Traveler: About Doutey...
Jalade: Mr. Doutey is a good guy. He's really diligent and friendly, and always puts others first.
Jalade: Having said that, the man is a bit too obsessed with reports, data sheets, and meeting minutes.
Jalade: I half-suspect the main reason he proposed to expand Lumidouce Harbor was so that he could immerse himself in a deluge of meetings every day.
