Traveler: What do you have to deal with?
Nizam: For example, when it comes to the birthday of Lesser Lord Kusanali, residents nearby would come to the Akademiya to apply for funds to hold the Sabzeruz Festival.
Nizam: But ever since the departure of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, the higher-ups stopped organizing the festival.
Nizam: They're not responsible for dealing with questions and doubts from the residents. In the end, I'm the one who has to smooth things out... I have to handle all kinds of things.
Nizam: But as much as I complain about it, I'm still going to do as I should.
