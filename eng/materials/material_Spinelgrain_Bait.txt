# Spinelgrain Bait

Made from a mixture of Spinel Fruit and Grainfruit, this peculiar Natlan fish bait can maintain its shape even after having been submerged for extended periods of time. By dissipating flavor at a consistent rate, its remarkable power to attract fish continues unabated for a very long time indeed.

Suitable for catching normal Rapidfish, Sunfish, and normal Unihornfish.
