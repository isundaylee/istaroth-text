Message: Shocking news! Shocking news! I just saw the Chief Justice and the young boss of Spina di Rosula coming over together!
Message: Did the cafe's owner run their mouth again and offend both the Palais Mermonia and Spina di Rosula...
Another Person's Message: Nonsense! If that were true, he would be sleeping with the fishes by now! The Chief Justice is here to conduct an investigation about a threatening letter written to a certain Melusine...
A Third Person's Message: A threatening letter to a Melusine!? How dare they! What idiot would look down on us Fontainians like this!?
Another Person's Message: Exactly! I think we shouldn't be waiting around for the Maison Gardiennage to resolve things! Let's patrol the streets to keep that Melusine safe!
A Third Person's Message: Well said! Count me in! I live close to the horlogerie, so leave that area to me!
