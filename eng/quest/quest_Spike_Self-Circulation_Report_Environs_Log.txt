# Spike Self-Circulation Report: Environs Log

Hosseini: #You're just in time, {NICKNAME}. We were just discussing how to move the Pursina's Spike in...
Hosseini: I must say, however, that the situation is far more serious than we anticipated.
Hao: *cough* This is bad, there's too much dark mud here, and it's crawling with monsters attracted by the mud. We can't move the Spike in.
Hao: We can't find any path forward at all...
Tu: We're still a long way off from the mining tunnels. C'mon, we've got to try again.
Tu: If it still doesn't work out, let's go back out there and grab a few more buddies to help out!
Tu: I mean, am I not Tu the Mining Superstar? I can carve through a mountain with but a few swings of my pickaxe! These monsters are no match for me. Let's get moving!
Hao: Bah, keep on faking, we'll see how much redder your face can get from all that coughing.
Tu: Nonsense, I... *cough*
Hosseini: We can't proceed any further in.
Hosseini: Long-term exposure to this mud will have severe consequences. The large number of monsters makes things even more dangerous.
Tu: But we all saw it, didn't we? We put the machine in the mining complex, and it was cleaned up just like that.
Tu: If... *cough* if we could just get rid of all this mud sooner...
Hosseini: This isn't the time to be prizing speedy solutions. Whether it be in experiments or in problem-solving, proceeding without preparation and proper examination is too rash. One mistake could cost lives!
Hosseini: "Your own life is of utmost importance." This is one of the basic axioms of the Akademiya's lab manual.
Hosseini: As a researcher from the Akademiya, I cannot simply stand by and allow such foolhardiness.
Hao: But if we stop... Who's going to do something about all this mud?
Hao: If it continues to attract these monsters, it wouldn't matter if we brought another 20 people... *cough* We wouldn't make any headway.
Hosseini: Let me think...
Hosseini: If this really is unworkable, we could activate the Spike once more over here first...
Hao: Here?
Hosseini: That's right. I just gave the dark mud emissions a once-over, and though they are faster than how they were the day before in the mining complex, this is not yet the heart of the problem, so the purification rate should be quicker than the rate at which the dark mud can flow out.
Hosseini: Those monsters in The Chasm were attracted by the dark mud. I suspect that they must be affected by its energies.
Hosseini: #So setting the Spike up here and decreasing the mud's influence in the vicinity should also be of help to you, {NICKNAME}.
Hosseini: If we clear the mud out, the monsters should stop congregating. Once that's happened, we can try moving the Spike further in.
Traveler: Then let's do this.
Hosseini: You two, head back to camp and rest first. We'll have need of you later.
Tu: Come on, I don't need rest yet! We just... *cough* It's not time for the Mining Superstar to lay his pickaxe down just yet! If it's clearing monsters, I can help out too!
Hao: Quit the tough-guy act already! I've seen this pattern of yours before...
Hao: #This is {NICKNAME} we're talking about. Where {F#she}{M#he} gets to fixing things, there's little people like you and I have to fear.
Hao: #We'll leave the dark mud in this area to you, {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: Got it.
Hosseini: #Ah yes, {NICKNAME}, this entire area is covered in mud. The situation is far worse than I thought...
Hosseini: There are also a lot of monsters nearby. Stay on your toes...
Traveler: I'll take care of myself.
Hosseini: No, no, I mean "stay on your toes regarding the Pursina's Spike."
Hosseini: I have full confidence in your abilities, but less so in the awesome yet fragile Spike.
Hosseini: Please make sure that the Spike makes it through unscathed.
Traveler: Leave it to me. Just relax.
