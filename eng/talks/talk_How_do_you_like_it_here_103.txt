# Talk Dialog

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Arlecchino: Thank you for inviting me to this realm. This has proved a fine vacation spot.
Arlecchino: Is a transfer of ownership on the cards, by any chance?
Traveler: ...Huh!?
Arlecchino: No need to startle. This is a quiet and secure location, shielded from outside disturbances. It would make for a good backup base.
Arlecchino: Any object that could solve many problems is worth paying a fair price for.
Traveler: Sorry to disappoint...
Arlecchino: An unfortunate answer, but not an unexpected one.
Arlecchino: This resembles a "home" more than it does a base. Let us keep it that way, then.
Traveler: Speaking of "home"...
Arlecchino: Is something the matter?
Traveler: Want to hold a "family barbecue"?
Arlecchino: A fine suggestion. This space is sufficiently large for a family gathering.
Arlecchino: The children will be glad to have the chance to visit and play at a friend's place. It is agreed, then... as for the costs of this gathering, simply leave it to me.
Traveler: All the children from the House of the Hearth would be welcome to come.
Traveler: But this isn't for sale.
Traveler: You want to buy the Serenitea Pot?
