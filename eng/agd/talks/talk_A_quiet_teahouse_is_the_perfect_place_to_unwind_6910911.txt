Yumemizuki Mizuki: A quiet teahouse is the perfect place to unwind... Of course, I'm referring to a quiet ambiance rather than complete silence. Gentle, soothing music played at just the right volume can do wonders for the spirit.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: You know, this is an excellent place for "guided meditation." That's a conventional treatment in my line of work...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: So, here, take a seat. Let go of your troubles, and I will help you relax.
