# Monumental Study


## Talk 1

Sosi: Lady Sorush, and the two of you as well. Perfect timing!
Traveler: Perfect timing...? I have a bad feeling about this.
Paimon: #Yeah, you're right. When people say "perfect timing," it's always followed by really troublesome requests... Traveler, maybe we should make a run for it after she's done talking.
Sosi: Um, please wait! I do have a request to make, but I promise it won't be too much work! Besides, the matter is actually... closely related to Lady Sorush.
Paimon: Well then... Since it has to do with Sorush, Paimon supposes we'll hear you out.
Sosi: Wonderful! Please, come with me.
Paimon: Is it something you can't say here?
Sosi: No, it's just that some things are easier to understand after you've seen them yourselves.
Traveler: Perfect timing for what? Dinner?
Paimon: Yay, dinner time! What should we get today?
Sosi: Dinner? If you're referring to the victory feast... it's not time yet. Anyway, I do have a request to make, and it's closely related to Lady Sorush...

## Talk 2

Sorush: She should know something about this...
Sosi: Lady Sorush? What brings you here...?
Paimon: We found some strange stuff...
Black Screen Text: You show Sosi the monument fragments...
Sosi: Could this be...! Perfect timing!
Traveler: Perfect timing...? I have a bad feeling about this.
Paimon: #Yeah, you're right. When people say "perfect timing," it's always followed by really troublesome requests... Traveler, maybe we should make a run for it after she's done talking.
Sosi: Um, please wait! I do have a request to make, but I promise it won't be too much work! Besides, the matter is actually... closely related to Lady Sorush.
Paimon: Well then... Since it has to do with Sorush, Paimon supposes we'll hear you out.
Sosi: Wonderful! Please, come with me.
Paimon: Is it something you can't say here?
Sosi: No, it's just that some things are easier to understand after you've seen them yourselves.
Traveler: Perfect timing for what? Dinner?
Paimon: Yay, dinner time! What should we get today?
Sosi: Dinner? If you're referring to the victory feast... it's not time yet. Anyway, I do have a request to make, and it's closely related to Lady Sorush...

## Talk 3

Sosi: Hm? Do you have questions?
Traveler: About the Khvarena Monument.
Sosi: Trust me, I'm a righteous person that only wishes to learn of the original contents of the inscription. There's nothing shady involved, I promise.
Traveler: About the Fatui officer.
Sosi: I'm envious of his strength... Ahem, I mean, I've been finding him an eyesore for a while now. He needs to pay the price for openly scheming on our territory...

## Talk 4

Paimon: What does Sosi want to show us? Isn't this just one big stone tablet?
Paimon: Hmm... did it get eroded? Paimon can't make out what's written on it...
Sosi: The Khvarena Monument is a valuable artifact to the Order of Skeptics. It only appears this way because its fragments are lost.
Sosi: Engraved on the monument are the true names of every Pari and the first contract they formed with the Order of Skeptics.
Sosi: The immortality of the Pari is sustained by the Khvarena Monument. One who manages to collect all four fragments and causes the contract to reappear...
Sosi: ...Will re-establish a contract with the Pari and obtain a power that rivals the gods.
Paimon: Oh...
Traveler: Sounds nice and all, but what does that have to do with us?
Paimon: Yeah, we're not interested in obtaining the power of the gods.
Paimon: As for forming contracts with Pari... We're already friends with Sorush, so Paimon thinks there's no need for formalities like that!
Sorush: Who told you we were friends? Do mind your manners, Pale Floater.
Paimon: Um, you do have a point. We'll be friends once Paimon returns the favor by coming up with an ugly nickname for you! Hehe.
Sorush: #Hmph! Paimon's disrespectful behavior aside, I assume you're planning to task Traveler with collecting the monument's fragments?
Sosi: That's very observant of you, Lady Sorush. That is indeed my plan.
Sosi: Searching is quite a lowly task— Ahem, a task requiring adventure experience is better suited for professionals. And by that, I mean adventurers.
Sorush: So you seek to form a new contract with us Pari and acquire a power that rivals the gods?
Sorush: Oh, how very interesting. A mere human, coveting a higher power... Could it be your inflated ego, or utter ignorance?
Sosi: How could I have such presumptuous thoughts...! I'm doing all this for the sake of research and bringing the historical truth to light.
Sosi: The Akademiya and the Order of Skeptics went separate ways due to a clash in our ideals, but our research has always emphasized history and heritage.
Sosi: I have never once coveted a higher power — the only thing I'm after is the contents of the inscription on the Khvarena Monument. It's all for the sake of research, I swear.
Sosi: The initial contract between us Skeptics and the Pari, and every single Pari's true name! Isn't that enough to pique your interest?
Traveler: I gotta admit, I am a bit curious.
Sosi: I suppose that's no surprise, coming from an adventurer with Lady Sorush's recognition...
Sosi: Anyway, this is a formal commission. Please be assured that you will be well compensated by the Order of Skeptics.
Paimon: Uh, since it's a formal commission with compensation and all, maybe we should give it a go.
Sosi: Splendid. Here are some clues regarding the locations of the monument's fragments... I trust that you're already familiar with clues like these as experienced adventurers.
Sosi: Oh, and one more thing. I have indeed sighted suspicious individuals who covet the power of gods. They seem to have come all the way from the snowy lands...
Sosi: I've seen them sneaking around the Khvarena Monument, and it's clear that they're up to no good. They've even started setting up camp nearby...
Sosi: I'm sure you wouldn't put up with these outlanders acting as they please on our land, Lady Sorush?
Paimon: Sounds like the Fatui... We just gotta chase them away, right?
Sosi: Yes, that's right, go teach them a lesson. They've set up three separate camps — I'll mark them on your map later.
Sosi: There's a commanding officer among them that watches over the whole situation. Perhaps defeating him would teach these outlanders to abide by our rules.
Sosi: Okay, enough talk. I leave the matter in your hands while I stay here and continue reading up on relevant documents. With Lady Sorush accompanying you, I'm sure everything will go smoothly.
Traveler: Not really. It's not like I can memorize everything...
Sosi: You're only interested in treasure, huh... Well, can't say I don't understand.

## Talk 5

Paimon: What does Sosi want to show us? Isn't this just one big stone tablet?
Paimon: Hmm... did it get eroded? Paimon can't make out what's written on it...
Sosi: The Khvarena Monument is a valuable artifact to the Order of Skeptics. It only appears this way because its fragments are lost.
Sosi: Engraved on the monument are the true names of every Pari and the first contract they formed with the Order of Skeptics.
Sosi: The immortality of the Pari is sustained by the Khvarena Monument. One who manages to collect all four fragments and causes the contract to reappear...
Sosi: ...Will re-establish a contract with the Pari and obtain a power that rivals the gods.
Paimon: Oh... Speaking of fragments, we did find four strange-looking things...
Traveler: Sounds nice and all, but what does that have to do with us?
Paimon: Yeah, we're not interested in obtaining the power of the gods.
Paimon: As for forming contracts with Pari... We're already friends with Sorush, so Paimon thinks there's no need for formalities like that!
Sorush: Who told you we were friends? Do mind your manners, Pale Floater.
Paimon: Um, you do have a point. We'll be friends once Paimon returns the favor by coming up with an ugly nickname for you! Hehe.
Sorush: #Hmph! Paimon's disrespectful behavior aside, I assume you're planning to ask Traveler to hand the fragments he collected over to you?
Sosi: That's very observant of you, Lady Sorush. I have indeed been planning to do so. Searching for things, after all, is quite a lowly task— Ahem, what I mean is...
Sosi: It's a trivial matter to professionals in this area, such as Adventurers... And since it's rather trivial, may I ask if...
Paimon: Searching isn't just some lowly task! It's not something anyone can do, because you gotta have lots of professional skills! For example... uh...
Traveler: A good vision.
Paimon: Paimon thinks you meant keen observation skills!
Paimon: We're not very interested in obtaining a divine power or anything, but Sosi, you want us to give you these four fragments for free?
Sorush: Do you seek to form a new contract with us Pari and acquire a power that rivals the gods, human?
Sorush: Oh, how very interesting. A mere human, coveting a higher power... Could it be your inflated ego, or utter ignorance?
Sosi: How could I have such presumptuous thoughts...! I'm doing all this for the sake of research and bringing the historical truth to light.
Sosi: The Akademiya and the Order of Skeptics went separate ways due to a clash in our ideals, but our research has always emphasized history and heritage.

Sosi: The initial contract between us Skeptics and the Pari, and every single Pari's true name! Isn't that enough to pique your interest?
Traveler: I gotta admit, I am a bit curious.
Sosi: I suppose that's no surprise, coming from an adventurer with Lady Sorush's recognition...
Sosi: *sigh*...How about I make this a formal commission? As long as you're willing to hand over the fragments, you will be well compensated by the Order of Skeptics.
Paimon: Uh, since it's a formal commission with compensation and all, maybe we should consider taking it.
Sosi: Splendid.
Sosi: Oh, and one more thing. I have indeed sighted suspicious individuals who covet the power of gods. They seem to have come all the way from the snowy lands...
Sosi: I've seen them sneaking around the Khvarena Monument, and it's clear that they're up to no good. They've even started setting up camp nearby...
Sosi: I'm sure you wouldn't put up with these outlanders acting as they please on our land, Lady Sorush?

Sosi: There's a commanding officer among them that watches over the whole situation. Perhaps defeating him would teach these outlanders to abide by our rules.
Sosi: I really can't bring myself to proceed with my reading until they learn their lesson and retreat... So please, I'm counting on you!
Traveler: Not really. It's not like I can memorize everything...
Sosi: You're only interested in treasure, huh... Well, can't say I don't understand.
Traveler: Intelligence.
Paimon: Yeah, there's lots of thinking involved when solving puzzles!
Traveler: Battle prowess.
Paimon: Hey, that should only be the last resort!

## Talk 6

Traveler: A good vision.
Paimon: Paimon thinks you meant keen observation skills!
Paimon: The strange things we found must be the monument fragments Sosi's talking about, right? So these are the stuff she wants...
Sorush: Do you seek to form a new contract with us Pari and acquire a power that rivals the gods, human?
Sorush: Oh, how very interesting. A mere human, coveting a higher power... Could it be your inflated ego, or utter ignorance?
Sosi: How could I have such presumptuous thoughts...! I'm doing all this for the sake of research and bringing the historical truth to light.

Traveler: I gotta admit, I am a bit curious.
Sosi: I suppose that's no surprise, coming from an adventurer with Lady Sorush's recognition...
Sosi: Anyway, this is a formal commission. Please be assured that you will be well compensated by the Order of Skeptics.
Paimon: Uh, since it's a formal commission with compensation and all, maybe we should give it a go.
Sosi: Splendid. Here are some clues regarding the locations of the monument's fragments... I trust that you're already familiar with clues like these as experienced adventurers.

Paimon: Hey, that should only be the last resort!

## Talk 7

Sosi: It seems that you've found all four monument fragments. About the Fatui that covet the power of the gods, especially their commanding officer...
Traveler: He said some strange things.
Paimon: And we couldn't talk any sense into him at all!
Sorush: Worry not. My Yasnapati has already taught them the lesson they deserve.
Sosi: Ohh! Thank you for informing me, Lady Sorush. That puts my mind at ease.
Sosi: According to the records, as long as we return the four fragments to their original places, the inscription on the Khvarena Monument will reappear.
Sosi: I'll place the honor of returning the fragments in our esteemed Yasnapati's hands, then. I'm sure that would suit your preference too, Lady Sorush.
Traveler: He was very polite.
Paimon: Yeah, but it felt really weird!

## Talk 8

Sosi: Lady Sorush, and you two... You...
Paimon: Never mind that for now! You Skeptics... how could you!
Sosi: Us Skeptics? You might want to re-organize your thoughts before speaking up.
Black Screen Text: You tell Sosi in detail about what Nasejuna had done...
Sosi: Is that so... But the incident seems completely arbitrary. His actions have undoubtedly violated the Order of Skeptics' true purpose, so one shouldn't generalize that to the whole order.
Paimon: But isn't he the uh, Vijnanapati? Are you really gonna let this slide?
Sosi: Let's put his nonconforming deeds aside for now. There's something of higher importance I need your opinion on... and it has something to do with Lady Sorush.
Paimon: Well then... Since it has to do with Sorush, Paimon supposes we'll hear you out.
Sosi: Wonderful! Please, come with me.
Paimon: Is it something you can't say here?
Sosi: No, it's just that some things are easier to understand after you've seen them yourselves.

## Talk 9

Sorush: She should know something about this...
Sosi: Lady Sorush? What brings you here...?
Paimon: We should ask about Nasejuna first!
Black Screen Text: You tell Sosi in detail about what Nasejuna had done and show her the monument fragments you found...
Sosi: Is that so... But the incident seems completely arbitrary. His actions have undoubtedly violated the Order of Skeptics' true purpose, so one shouldn't generalize that to the whole order.
Paimon: But isn't he the uh, Vijnanapati? Are you really gonna let this slide?
Sosi: Let's put his nonconforming deeds aside for now. There's something of higher importance I need your opinion on... The fragments you found are closely related to Lady Sorush and all Pari.
Paimon: Well then... Since it has to do with Sorush, Paimon supposes we'll hear you out.
Sosi: Wonderful! Please, come with me.
Paimon: Is it something you can't say here?
Sosi: No, it's just that some things are easier to understand after you've seen them yourselves.

## Talk 10

Sosi: It seems that you've found all four monument fragments.
Paimon: Never mind that for now! You Skeptics... how could you!
Sosi: Us Skeptics? You might want to re-organize your thoughts before speaking up.
Black Screen Text: You tell Sosi in detail about what Nasejuna had done...
Sosi: Is that so... But the incident seems completely arbitrary. His actions have undoubtedly violated the Order of Skeptics' true purpose, so one shouldn't generalize that to the whole order.
Paimon: But isn't he the uh, Vijnanapati? Are you really gonna let this slide?
Sosi: It's meaningless to delve further into his nonconforming deeds. I'm more concerned about the Fatui that covet the power of the gods, especially their commanding officer...
Traveler: He said some strange things.
Paimon: And we couldn't talk any sense into him at all!
Sorush: Worry not. My Yasnapati has already taught them the lesson they deserve.
Sosi: Ohh! Thank you for informing me, Lady Sorush. That puts my mind at ease.
Sosi: According to the records, as long as we return the four fragments to their original places, the inscription on the Khvarena Monument will reappear.
Sosi: I'll place the honor of returning the fragments in our esteemed Yasnapati's hands, then. I'm sure that would suit your preference too, Lady Sorush.
Traveler: He was very polite.
Paimon: Yeah, but it felt really weird!

## Talk 11

Sosi: Phew... Nervous? Me? I'm not nervous at all, simply very... excited.

## Talk 12

Black Screen Text: Before Sosi takes a closer look at the inscriptions on the Khvarena Monument, you hear a jumble of footsteps and a somewhat familiar voice...
Markozov: You! Can't! Do that!
Paimon: Huh? Why did he come all the way here?
Markozov: #You can't do that, young man. You can't take knowledge away from me.
Markozov: Knowledge is the source of my power! Oh, imagine how small and weak I'd be without knowledge... I wouldn't even be able to crush a butterfly's wings with my fist...
Traveler: I don't remember taking anything from you.
Sorush: Hmph, and we've given you a lot! You humans call them "badges of honor," correct?
Markozov: Knowledge is the only form of honor, and the only source of power! I need that Pari, that magical little thing... I can smell it on her... the fragrance of knowledge.
Paimon: Whoa... The guy's insane...
Sorush: I think he needs to be taught another lesson!
Paimon: #Traveler, we can't let him take Sorush!

## Talk 13

Paimon: He won't come back anymore, right...
Traveler: Is that what you get for pursuing knowledge...
Paimon: Uh, Paimon doesn't think they're related!
Sosi: Ahem. Anyway, I think we can try decoding the inscriptions on the monument now.
Paimon: Whoa, it's really become clearer! What does it say?
Black Screen Text: Sosi carefully reads the words that have emerged on the Khvarena Monument several times and seems to have reached a conclusion...
Sosi: How could this be...
Sorush: From that look on her face akin to a shriveled tree trunk, I'm pretty sure the inscription has nothing to do with contracts or divine powers.
Traveler: Well, I'm not surprised.
Paimon: Was Sosi secretly wishing to obtain the power of the gods? Why would she look so disappointed otherwise?
Sorush: Oh? I can't unhear that now.
Sosi: I—I'm just a little disappointed, that's all... Um, no! It's not because of the divine powers...
Sosi: I—I'm just disheartened by the revelation that our predecessor's documentations were factually inaccurate... They chose to leave written records precisely because it was the more reliable medium than passing it down verbally...
Sosi: I've skimmed through the inscription, and it looks like it contains records of past disasters... and how our Order of Skeptics predecessors dealt with them. Ugh... It's so different than what I've read about.
Sosi: But which version of knowledge corresponds to the truth? I need to continue looking into this...
Paimon: It's a good thing to want to learn more! But uh... don't turn into someone like that weird Fatui officer!
Sorush: Careful not to fall prey to seemingly convincing "knowledge" and descend into madnesss...
Sosi: That would be an overstatement. We Skeptics believe that true knowledge only surfaces when placed under scrutiny. As long as my will does not falter, I would never stray from the right path.
Sorush: Hmph...
Sosi: Thank you for all your hard work on this commission. I hope you're satisfied with the Order of Skeptics's compensation, and wish you a smooth journey ahead.
