Traveler: About your husband...
Kamla: Oh, that bastard... Well... honestly, I don't know where he's sailing right now.
Kamla: Judging by what he'd sent home, he should be safe and well, and he's been to a lot of places.
Kamla: I've got clocks from Fontaine, porcelain bowls from Liyue, dried petals from Mondstadt...
Kamla: I didn't know he could be romantic.
Kamla: But things like these can only be placed indoors. I prefer the fresh air and sea waves outside.
