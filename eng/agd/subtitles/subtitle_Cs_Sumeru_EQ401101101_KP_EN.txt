My dear friend, you must be wondering
Why I'm leaving you a letter like this
It's because...
Hey, Gulab! I'm here. How are you feeling today?
I gotta tell you, I had an idea for another card last night
Huh? What's that you're writing?
Haha, it's nothing
Okay... Anyway, up for a game?
You don't have to visit every day, you know. You should be focusing on your work at the Akademiya...
Hey, enough of that, I'll keep visiting until you've fully recovered
Besides, I can't stand most of the folks at the Akademiya anyway!
Hey, it's your turn
*coughing*
Gulab!? Are you okay?
*cough* Garvipidam, you must understand...
My Eleazar...
Hey! Don't talk like that!
You just need some more rest...
*sigh*...
It's because... you won't come to terms with the fact that I don't have long left
Guess what? This game we invented
Is getting pretty popular here in the hospital
Really? That's great news!
Yeah. I've even made a device
To help people find other players nearby
Here, this one's for you
This way, you'll be able to keep playing even after I'mâ€”
Just stop!
You're gonna get better, you hear me? I don't need this thing... I don't want it!
I imagine the Casket of Tomes I gave you
Is probably gathering dust in a corner somewhere...
So, this is my last gift to you. I'm sorry that I could only give it to you now
Do you remember when we first met?
You were the only one willing to be friends with the kid with Eleazar
Now it's my turn to help you make some new friends
This way, I'll always be by your side, my friend
