# Stuffed N' Mashed Potatoes

An exquisitely colorful dish. Mash the potatoes into a fine creamy state, add various fillings in the middle, then finally, drizzle with sauce for a touch of brightness. The end result is not dissimilar from a finely-made cake, and is the favorite dish of many in Natlan.
