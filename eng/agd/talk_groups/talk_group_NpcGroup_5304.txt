Carabosse: Hehe. It seems that the Truesight Potion has been marvelously successful. I think that quite a few enhanced formulas can be made, too... Vere can decide their exact proportions, I suppose.
Carabosse: Hmm? What is it? Would you like any potions made by yours truly?

Traveler: Tell me about potion-making...
Carabosse: Well now, to think that you'd be interested in such. I suppose you're also one enthralled by "possibility." Good, good.
Carabosse: You see, in potion-making...
Carabosse: You process ingredients that don't have any effects on their own, mix them together, and they'll turn into potions that can work in lots of different ways!
Carabosse: It is a deed akin to using the impression things have given you in your memories, and combining them with flashes of inspiration to create new "realities."
Carabosse: Even I do not know what the potioning possibilities are! This is the excitement of being a potioneer.

Traveler: Tell me about your assistant...
Carabosse: Oh, you mean Vere. She's an earnest girl, and she's been a great help to me in measuring potion proportions and conducting experiments.
Carabosse: She's the only one who can help me complete said experiments...
Carabosse: Ah, yes — she also names some of the products, the Truesight Potion being amongst them.
Carabosse: That said, I do think that she's too straight-laced in her naming sense. I think something like my "Coasty-Toasty Potion" is cutesier...

Traveler: No, I'm just passing through.
