# Talk Dialog

Yumemizuki Mizuki: I used my powers to cushion our fall... Is everyone alright?
Paimon: Don't worry, we've fallen from bigger heights before... The bigger issue here is that he got away, and we were so close! Gah...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: We've been completely cut off. That creature has taken complete control of his consciousness... We'll never catch him.
Paimon: Hmm... Would it be easier if we wake up now and go catch him in the real world? If this is his nightmare, he must be asleep somewhere, right?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Remember the fragrance we smelled on our way in? That's how the monster lures people into the dream state. Now we're inside, we can't get out unless we manage to defeat him in his true form.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: He's turned Emura Chuuya's nightmare into his lair. There's only one way to force him into the open, and that's by finding a way to eat this nightmare.
Paimon: Eat this nightmare? But is that even possible?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Not only is it possible, Paimon, it's quite literally my job.
Paimon: Paimon knows that! It's just... we all saw what happened to Murasaki and Shion, and this nightmare is super intense... Paimon's worried this won't turn out well.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: ...This monster has harmed too many people. We have to stop it.
Traveler: But, Mizuki...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: It's okay, I knew what I was getting into. Let's get moving.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Hmm... We may not have caught him, but our chase wasn't in vain. He led us deep inside his dream... We should now be at the subconscious layer that makes up its core.
Paimon: It's so dark...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: That's what happens if you leave your negative emotions to fester...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: There must be a lot of emotional fragments in this place. We need to follow them one by one, until we reach our destination.
Paimon: Wait, but what is our destination?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Where the light is.
