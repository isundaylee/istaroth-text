# Autumn's Gift

A musical toy sold at Bertin's House of Curiosities. It is very popular among children. This one appears to have been bought a long while back and is no longer the latest model available in the store.
The chiming tune played in your palm takes the place of all the words that could not be said. This present, which could not be sent, has been forsaken, and is thus now yours.
