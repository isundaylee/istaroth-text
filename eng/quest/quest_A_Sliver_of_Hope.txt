# A Sliver of Hope


## Talk 1

Paimon: Whew, these plants are getting a little out of control.
Paimon: Oh, but this is someone's place, isn't it... Guess we can't go chopping everything down...

## Talk 2

Satoru: The Naganohara Fireworks Show must be coming up soon, right? My daughter left quite a while ago.
Satoru: Heh, she couldn't get out the house quickly enough. She's clearly very taken with this boy in the city, it was written all over her face...
Satoru: *sigh* But, at least she's happy, I suppose.

## Talk 3

Imatani Saburou: I'm sorry that we weren't much help.
Imatani Kaori: One day, though, that child is going to have to face up to his feelings.
Imatani Kaori: This is one life lesson that he can't learn from his parents.

## Talk 4

Yoimiya: Now that we've finished all the chores, it's time to talk to the Imatanis about Sakujirou.

## Talk 5

Yoimiya: *sigh* Well, can't say we didn't try.
Yoimiya: I'll let Sakujirou know after we get back.

## Talk 6

Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Yoimiya, something bad's happened! Some people from the Tenryou Commission came by.
Yoimiya: Huh? Why? ...Do they know?
Yoimiya: Pops, are you alright? They didn't do anything to you, did they?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: I told them the show was starting soon and the place was filled with fireworks, so they shouldn't go in because it's a fire hazard.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: But they didn't listen. It seemed like they knew Sakujirou was inside.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Luckily, Sakujirou heard them coming in time and managed to escape through the window. The Tenryou Commission wasn't able to capture him.
Yoimiya: This is bad news. I don't think Sakujirou had enough time to make his mind up...
Yoimiya: Pops, did you see where he went?
Yoimiya: The Tenryou Commission will definitely be chasing after him.
Traveler: Did you catch any of their names?
Yoimiya: Good point! Names, we need names! Suddenly showing up like this, surely it must be Keisuke's doing!
Yoimiya: The Commission wouldn't normally cause this big of a fuss over a stowaway.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Sorry, my ears are no good, and I didn't get a good look at them either. If you're wondering which way they went, they left the city.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: I wish I caught their names... *sigh* But I didn't hear a thing...
Morihiko: As it happens, I did.
Morihiko: I was getting some ore from my friend's place and happened to bump into them on the way over.
Morihiko: I think their leader's name was Keisuke, just like you said.
Yoimiya: Just as I thought! Thanks!
Yoimiya: If Sakujirou still hasn't made up his mind, those two running into each other won't solve anything â€” and even worse, there'll be no coming back from it for Sakujirou.
Yoimiya: #We can't let that happen. Come with me, {NICKNAME}, let's track them down!

## Talk 7

Imatani Kaori: Thank you, dears. *sigh* Sorry to make you run errands for us.
Imatani Saburou: I'll brew some tea and prepare some snacks for when you get back.
