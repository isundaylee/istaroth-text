# Talk Dialog

Helka: Ready to take on the giant mechanical monster?
Traveler: I'll get prepping now.
Traveler: Let's talk a bit first...
Helka: I've seen relics of a similar stripe in Nod-Krai... Yeah, on the island where the Frostmoon Scions gather...
Helka: But they're all as dead as dead can be, so this is the first time I'm seeing one move the way this one does. Fascinating — I'll record this and tell Maisie all about it.
Traveler: So, who are these "Frostmoon Scions," again...?
Helka: They're a... weird bunch, I'd say? They're not like the people of Nasha Town at all, the way they live in the wilds and forests most of the time.
Helka: Word has it that they worship some moon deity, and you can find statues they've made all over Nod-Krai. As for the rest, I don't really know — Katya's warned me not to look into them too much.
Helka: But what I have seen them do is magic. It's a shocking sight, I'll tell you that.
Traveler: Hold on.
