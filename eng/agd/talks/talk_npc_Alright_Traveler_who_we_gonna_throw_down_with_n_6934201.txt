Arataki Itto: #Alright, Traveler, who we gonna throw down with next? I'm ready to rumble!
Arataki Itto: What are we waiting for, anyway? C'mon, let's gooo! Or they'll start thinkin' we're scared of 'em!
Arataki Itto: Oh, but I guess you need some time to organize the victory feast, right? Gotta plan ahead for these things! ...Okay yeah, we can hang around here a little longer. Good thing I got this lollipop to tide me over.
