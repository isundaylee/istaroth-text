Yiran: Manager Kuan! I want the moon!
Manager Kuan: Hey, aren't each of your requests becoming less reasonable than the last? Also, for the last time, just call me "Daddy."
Yiran: Nope. Also, my requests are not that unreasonable.
Yiran: Isn't the Moonchase Festival all about chasing the moon? If you can get it for me, Manager Kuan, then no one will have to chase it.
Yiran: That would make you everyone's hero, Manager Kuan!
Manager Kuan: I'm not some hero, I'm just Kuan... No, wait, I'm your Daddy!
Yiran: Well, if you're my Daddy, and then you can fulfill my wishes, right? I'll study hard, and you'll get me the moon. That's fair, right?
Manager Kuan: I don't think this is a question of fairness. It's more that... I can't get the moon in the first place.
Yiran: *sigh* Then until you get the moon, you're not a hero, you're Manager Kuan.
