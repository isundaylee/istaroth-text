# Problem Conversion: The Underpinning Factor


## Talk 1

Rafiq: If we increase the strength here, we'll have to...
Qishan: If you go with this design, there won't be much of a difference from the one before.
Traveler: Are you still working on your ship design?
Rafiq: Ah, it's the Traveler. Yes, Qishan and I have discussed some... key aspects of the design since our last trial.
Rafiq: We had a... full exchange of opinions, and are trying to work out a new design.
Rafiq: But we still had some divergence regarding the use of materials.
Rafiq: But I followed Qishan's advice this time! I bought a bunch of solid materials. Cost me a fortune, too!
Rafiq: As you can see, Traveler, I can't move all these alone. Qishan isn't strong enough either, so could you...
Traveler: We'll do this together.
Rafiq: I knew I could count on you! Let's get rolling.
Rafiq: Qishan hand-picked the materials herself. I believe that things will work out this time.
Rafiq: I've got bigger rewards for you this time as well. Thanks for your help.
Traveler: Okay, let's get this done.

## Talk 2

Qishan: Talking Rafiq into spending more Mora is actually harder than getting my boss to give me a raise.

## Talk 3

Rafiq: So? Have you finished moving the materials over?

## Talk 4

Rafiq: Aye, these materials should do. Please take your payment.
Rafiq: The materials that Qishan chose are really light... Are they really reliable?
Qishan: Trust me. They'll do better than the ones you picked before.
Rafiq: Well, guess it's your turn to prepare life jackets for me...
Qishan: Oh, have some trust in me... These will suffice.
