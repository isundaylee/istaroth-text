Lanoire: It's too bad Cater isn't here! If he was, he could enjoy this with us too!
Earnshaw: Even if Cater was here, you still wouldn't be allowed to drink any more Fonta today.
Lanoire: Awww... But Cater said, you have to share with others to be even more happy!
Earnshaw: I'm sure Cater also said not to have too much sugar and to brush your teeth after eating.
Lanoire: Oh... He did mention that...

Traveler: Thanks. How are Hero and the others?
Earnshaw: Well, they're fine — by which I mean they're always making me worry. What's new?
Earnshaw: At least they're alive and kicking, which means they're healthy. That's always a good thing.

Traveler: About Agnes...
Earnshaw: If she hadn't been so stubborn... *sigh* It's my fault, I was the one who was too stubborn. I'm a stone-hearted old fool.
Earnshaw: But according to Lanoire, she smiled at everyone, even until the very end...

Traveler: About Lanoire...
Earnshaw: That child... She's just like her mother — spirited and independent.
Earnshaw: Children grow up so quickly. What can I say? I just hope that she can live the life she wants. Health and happiness are more important than anything else.

## Talk 9

Earnshaw: Phew, that was close...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Earnshaw: *sigh* I didn't think that there would be any hilichurls that dared to attack people so close to the Court of Fontaine. I don't know what I'd have done if Lanoire was hurt. But thanks to you...
Earnshaw: I was of a mind to not let her run around again. But if I did that, how different would life here be from life in the Fortress of Meropide?
Earnshaw: I suppose I'll just keep her company more often, so that if anything happens, she'll at least have some adult to rely on.
Traveler: See you.
Earnshaw: Bye, take care! Don't have your loved ones worrying about you, alright?
