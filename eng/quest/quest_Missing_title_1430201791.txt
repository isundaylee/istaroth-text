# Missing title (1430201791)

Drifting Bottle (Paimon): Hmm, this bottle feels heavy. Seems like there's something inside it...
Drifting Bottle: "An old friend of ours came over yesterday bearing ill tidings..."
Drifting Bottle: "I have not received a reply from you in a long while. Perhaps he is right, and I should accept reality."
Drifting Bottle: "But nonetheless, if you are still wandering the land, should you receive this missive, I hope that you can send me a reply."
Drifting Bottle: "Attach your insignia to your letter, that I may recognize you by its presence when the time comes."
Drifting Bottle: "Do you remember Uyuu Restaurant? We shall meet there. You will find money for wine attached herein."
Drifting Bottle: "But if you are not the one I was expecting to receive this letter..."
Drifting Bottle: "Then please, take this keepsake all the same. Perhaps you might be able to find its original owner for me â€” do also take the Mora in here as thanks."
