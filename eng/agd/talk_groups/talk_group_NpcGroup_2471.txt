Vert Jr.: Hmm... So many businesses, so much potential. All they lack is a guide to help build up their brand image.

Traveler: And you are?
Vert Jr.: Hello there, my friendly and passionate friend. I'm Vert Jr., and I hail from Quartier Lyonnais in the Court of Fontaine, where I'm really known as Petit Vert.
Vert Jr.: After arriving in Yilong Wharf, my friends in Liyue nicknamed me Vert Jr. based on my name's meaning.
Vert Jr.: Vert, or green, is the color of tea leaves. So far, it's made the locals more affable toward me and helped build my personal brand...
Vert Jr.: And in the long term, I'll be having an extended stay in Yilong Wharf to carefully study and promote the local cuisine.
Vert Jr.: Hmm... Why don't I call my first travel guide "Vert's Vouchsafes"!

Traveler: Brand image?
Vert Jr.: What do you think? It's your first time hearing this term, I'll bet!
Vert Jr.: My elder sister Rouge and I are both representatives of this profession!
Vert Jr.: We still haven't made a name for ourselves in the Court of Fontaine, sure, but many stores have sought out our help!
Vert Jr.: We offer comprehensive assistance to stores to improve their public brand, including but not limited to advertisements, news columns, short videos, large-scale events, etc.
Vert Jr.: For many stores, their excellent service is not reflected in their reputation. However, through the publicity we offer, we will bring their repute up to par with their ability.
Vert Jr.: According to the information we've collected, some restaurants in Liyue are suffering from this issue...
Vert Jr.: Most restaurants here offer delicious cuisine at reasonable prices, so they rarely have any competitors in the same price range. Residents only need to spend a small amount of Mora to enjoy a sumptuous feast.
Vert Jr.: However, more high-end food and beverage brands are needed... After all, even chefs require the support of a brand image.
Vert Jr.: If all restaurants operated on a small scale, the culinary profession would be seen as tons of work for little money. Few would be willing to take up the culinary arts.
Vert Jr.: If this profession is to have a future, we'll also need outfits that target the wealthy, earn big, and pay chefs handsomely...
Vert Jr.: This high-low combination will allow the general public to enjoy delicious food without worry. It would also be respectable to be a chef, and you'd be paid proportionately to your skill.
Vert Jr.: Maybe I can help improve this situation... I'll need to get a better understanding of Liyue's food industry first, though.
Vert Jr.: Best to start our research from Yilong Wharf before gradually expanding outward...

Traveler: A tourism guidebook?
Vert Jr.: Heh! My sister Rouge and I have dedicated ourselves to the discovery of sights worth visiting and cuisine worth tasting.
Vert Jr.: Gorgeous views and delicious food are treasures that belong to everyone in Teyvat. Every tourist should seize the opportunity to enjoy them!
Vert Jr.: But non-frequent visitors must inquire about the scenic spots and cuisine from scratch...
Vert Jr.: What a bother! It would probably take them years, just like it's taking me!
Vert Jr.: Just think! How convenient would things be if we had one... Or even several detailed, comprehensive guides to refer to?
Vert Jr.: That's exactly why my sister and I have decided to explore every settlement in Teyvat. We'll create that very series of travel guides for the sake of all tourists!
Vert Jr.: Things have been going very smoothly, and we only encountered a small hiccup along the way...
Vert Jr.: Problem being that my sister found herself unused to the food outside of Fontaine, so we had to switch jobs...
Vert Jr.: Now, her Rouge's Registry will be a record of scenic attractions, while my Vert's Vouchsafes will be about cuisine!
