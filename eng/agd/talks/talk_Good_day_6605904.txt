# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Good day.
Caramuru: Hello, hello! Sorry, but I can't chat for too long.
Caramuru: Now I'm not an introvert, but working hours are as they are, and getting caught slacking off could go badly for me.
Caramuru: What work am I doing, you ask? Why, shift duty! And how will I do that? ... Well, by being here, am I right?
