# Petal-Lit Ships Fish For the Moon


## Talk 1

Beidou: So... this is it? This is your boat?
Beidou: It's really, uh... compact. But, it works... It's about the right size for sweeping up junk from the water's surface.
Xinyan: Only thing is... we're packed in like sardines here. There's nowhere to put my guitar...
Beidou: Uh, Xinyan, your "axe" is getting a little too close for comfort...
Xinyan: Oh! Whoops! Lemme try to move that out of your way...
Paimon: ...Huh? Umm Xinyan, why does your guitar have blades on it?
Xinyan: Self-defense, of course! It shoots fire, too! ...Oh, but the middle of a big festival probably isn't the best time to give you a demonstration...
Xinyan: Also, there's a teeny-tiny chance it might set your boat on fire... That's not a risk worth taking, no matter how small...
Paimon: Whew, this gal really jazzed up her guitar...

## Talk 2

Xinyan: Hold up, are those... Treasure Hoarders!?
Beidou: We don't usually see these guys out at sea... Could they be here for the same reason as us?
Beidou: C'mon, Traveler. Steer us a little closer.

## Talk 3

Xinyan: Hey! There're some things floating on the water...
Beidou: Hmm, I can't quite make out what they are. Let's bring them in and take a look.
Beidou: I'll take the rudder. Traveler, Xinyan — go reel them in.

## Talk 4

Xinyan: Seems like the Treasure Hoarders are more of a mixed bag than I thought...

## Talk 5

Xinyan: Huh? Why're they heading back to shore?
Beidou: To reconvene with their posse, I'll bet.
Beidou: Speed it up a notch, Traveler. This is a chase now.

## Talk 6

Carmen: Stop! All of you!
Carmen: Are you blind? Can't you see this is Captain Beidou!?
Carmen: Hehe... Cap'n Beidou, it's been a while. Still fighting fit, I see.
Beidou: I guess it has been a while, Carmen. You're looking a little worse for wear.
Beidou: Maybe if you did your own dirty work rather than dispatching your minions, you wouldn't be so out of breath right now.
Carmen: Ah, how you jest, Beidou, very amusing... Hahaha...
Beidou: To get serious for a second, though — I'm gonna be needing all of this. So put everything down and I won't cause you any more trouble.
Carmen: Of course, of course, whatever Cap'n Beidou wants... You heard her, people. Drop the goods!
Carmen: Here you are, it's all here. So, uh... w—we'll take our leave now.
Black Screen Text: Carmen dashes away with the Treasure Hoarders...
Paimon: Wow, he did what we asked without a second thought...
Traveler: He couldn't surrender quickly enough.
Xinyan: Couldn't run off quickly enough, either...
Beidou: Don't waste any more time on them. We've still got salvaging to do.
Beidou: Ah, but we should load this stash onto the boat first... C'mon, Traveler, help me out here.

## Talk 7

Beidou: I wonder what's taking Sea Drake so long... Could he have run into the Treasure Hoarders, too?

## Talk 8

Liuliu (???): C'mon, we gotta wrap this up soon! Leave the junk, take anything and everything of value!
Liuliu (???): And I need a few of you to go and load the boat up, move it!
Beidou: Whatever you're about to do — don't. And whatever goods you're holding — they're mine now.
Liuliu (???): B—Beidou!? Wh—What are you doing here!?
Beidou: I might ask you the same question.
Liuliu: I mean, what does it look like? We got lucky. Found some treasure floating around in the ocean.
Liuliu: If you see anything you like, it's yours for the taking! A token of our esteem for the mighty Captain Beidou, hahaha!
Beidou: Is that right? Well, good. I'll take it all.
Liuliu: I... But... C'mon, heh, be reasonable here...
Liuliu: Me and the guys have been busting a gut gathering all this up... you gotta leave us a little something-something, surely?
Beidou: Lemme make this crystal clear: These things do not belong to you, and they never will. So you're gonna put them down, and then you're gonna get as far away from me as is physically possible.
Liuliu: That's a little, uh... Heh, why don't we start over, huh? You see, we—
Beidou: Huh... sounds a lot like you're stalling to me.
Beidou: Talk is cheap. Let's settle this the old-fashioned way!

## Talk 9

Paimon: Boy, they sure ran off quickly...
Beidou: Eh, who cares. They didn't take anything with them.
Beidou: The bigger problem here is, there's no way all of this is going to fit onto your boat.
Beidou: Hmm... Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Unload the boat and put everything here, in one place.
Beidou: Based on the original plan, Sea Drake's boat should be coming past here at some point. When they get here, we'll hitch a ride with them.
Beidou: In the meantime, Traveler, head back to the Jade Chamber and deliver a message to Ningguang for me.
Beidou: Just tell her we're almost done fishing for trinkets here, so she should start getting my compensation ready.
Traveler: Got it.
Beidou: Alright. Thanks, Traveler.
Beidou: If both Carmen and Liuliu were here... Then I wonder if that other "boss" of theirs, Big Sis, is snooping around?
Beidou: I've gotta tell Sea Drake and the rest of the crew to stay on high alert...

## Talk 10

Ningguang: Welcome back. I trust Beidou is making good progress on salvaging the items?
Traveler: Let me fill you in...
Black Screen Text: You bring Ningguang up to speed on the events so far...
Ningguang: Treasure Hoarders, I see... Yes, I can imagine that must have been rather irksome.
Ningguang: It sounds like you scared them off on this occasion. But it won't end there. They are not the type to forgive and forget.
Ningguang: You needn't concern yourself with them any further, though. Leave them to Beidou — she is well versed in handling Treasure Hoarders. I will be sure to make preparations for her compensation.
Ningguang: I also owe you my thanks for coming all this way to deliver Beidou's message. Here, please take this as a token of my appreciation.
Ningguang: Now, please excuse me, I have other business that demands my attention. I wish you a fun-filled festival.
