Candace: I hope the sand didn't get into your sleeves, Traveler. Here, have a seat.
Traveler: Are you busy?
Candace: No, I was just practicing an ancient melody. It's beautiful, but I don't know how it ends. That knowledge has been lost to the sands.
Candace: I used to play it over and over again, never able to fully complete it.
Candace: But tonight, I want to try to give it a suitable ending.
Candace: Perhaps it's just the festival spirit, but I can't help but feel like certain stories deserve a happy ending...
Candace: Certain memories remain just as precious, even as they fade with time...
Traveler: Back so soon?
Candace: Sounds like our Knight of Flowers hasn't had enough of the festivities.
Candace: But, Aaru Village is where I truly belong.
Candace: I had a wonderful time with everyone, but I don't mind returning to my daily life.
Candace: This is no time to be sad.
Candace: You see? Look at the sky... Another beautiful day is just around the corner.
Traveler: I've got something else to do right now...
Candace: In any case, even when the festivities end, that joy stays with us.
