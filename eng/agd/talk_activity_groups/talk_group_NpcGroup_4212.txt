Arayash: Festival Utsava... a bit troublesome... Must take good care of this place, must take good care of everyone's safety...

## Talk

Traveler: Something's on your mind?
Arayash: Ah, it's the Golden Nara...
Arayash: How embarrassing... Festival Utsava should be a happy festival for everyone, but when thinking about how some very bad people will try to intrude on this festival, it's not nice anymore.
Arayash: So I am a little unhappy...

Traveler: About the Statue of The Seven...
Arayash: This is the stone of the Lord of Trees and the Lord of Dendro! It's very important!

Traveler: Goodbye.
Arayash: Goodbye, Golden Nara. I hope you won't meet any bad guys.

## Talk

Traveler: I will defeat the bad guys.
Arayash: Golden Nara looks skilled enough to defeat bad guys.
Arayash: But Arayash doesn't want Golden Nara's help, because Golden Nara is the guest of Aranara.

Arayash: Festival Utsava is over, and Marana has been defeated too. Vanarana is safe.

Arayash: #This is all thanks to Nara Traveler and Arama.
