# Weighty Wings


## Talk 1

Mouse: Ugh, you're... tougher than you look...
Night Owl: Gah. Who did we offend... Who'd send someone on this day, of all days, to come whack us...
Night Owl: #Please, {M#Big Bro}{F#Big Sis}. How have we offended you? Just... let us know. We won't do it again.
Mouse: Hey, you little rascal! You're really gonna grovel before this piece of work?
Night Owl: You think talking tough's going to make us a living? I can see it now, I tell you. We're just living like thieves and crooks. There's nothing special about trafficking Saurians, is there?
Night Owl: If the only alternative's being robbed by a stronger crook, why shouldn't I go with them instead?
Night Owl: #And not to brag, {M#Big Bro}{F#Big Sis}, but I'm sure I'd be way more useful to you than these two. Just call me if you need anything. I'll settle it, nice and clean.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Hmm?
Traveler: Well, I do happen to be shopping about for a sidekick.
Paimon: Are you serious!? No way! Paimon vetoes this motion!
Paimon: Also, you're a bunch of bad eggs anyway! No way good guys like us would team up with Saurian traffickers like you!
Traveler: Yup, there's no one good-er than me.
Paimon: #Ahem! Anyway, whatever designs you have on the Saurians, better stop now, or we'll... Well, {NICKNAME} will show you what's what.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Black Screen Text: The two traffickers leave amidst a cloud of resentment...
Paimon: Paimon wonders how that Qucusaurus is doing. Shall we go see to it?
Traveler: Well, there's always room for accommodation.
Paimon: #Hey, you're gonna be a bad influence on {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}! Don't worry, little guy, there's no way we're teaming up with this lot!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rrrah... Rawr!
Traveler: Thanks for your consideration, but no need.

## Talk 2

Qucusaurus: Roar...
Paimon: Oh no, it looks so weak... It must have suffered so much...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wooo... Rrrooo...
Traveler: If only there was something we could do to help...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rrah... Rawr! Raaawr!
Paimon: #What is it? Do you have an idea, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: We can't take care of it forever, can we...
Paimon: But there's gotta be something we can do to make it feel better, even if it's only for a short time...

## Talk 3

Qucusaurus: (It looks incredibly weak. If only there was some way to revive it...)

## Talk 4

#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Raaawr! Rawr!
Paimon: Do you think Embercore Flowers might help it out?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: Sure, we can give it a go!

## Talk 5

Qucusaurus: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr... Rawr!
Paimon: Looks like it's kinda reinvigorated?
Paimon: Heh. Flew away just like that... Guess it still doesn't trust us, huh?
Traveler: Trust isn't built overnight, you know.
Paimon: #That's true. We had to work hard to reach the understanding we've got with {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} too!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr! Rawr rawr!
Paimon: #And it's not like we did it to earn its gratitude or anything, don'cha think, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: #Hehe, you're a generous little Saurian, aren't you? Just like Paimon and {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: Looks like it'll fly on its own power just fine.
Paimon: #Sure does. Great idea, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}!
