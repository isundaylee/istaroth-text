# The Recollector's Path


## Talk 1

Paimon: Seems like Zurvan had this training regimen all planned out a long time ago. Guess Sorush was always going to have to do these things, huh?
Sorush: Hmm. This is a sign that the elder has always favored me.
Sorush: Yasnapati. And Floater. Bear witness to my heroic feats.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Is this the last stop for our first day? We're pretty familiar with this place, seeing how we've been here plenty of times.
Sorush: Hmph? If the Pale Floater is so confident, then why not swap roles with me? I will play the audience, you be the speaker.
Paimon: Yeah. Let's give it a try. Here comes Paimon.
Paimon: The place before us — covered with flowers and flowing water — is the Vourukasha Oasis. This place doesn't have... uh... Right! This place isn't infested by the demons of Dev, and is the home of the Pari.
Paimon: There are many Pari here. The best among them is one called Zurvan.
Paimon: Sorush, you were born here too, right? Though you were different from the other Pari...
Paimon: For example, while the other Pari only sound kinda weird when they speak, you sound *really* weird! Hmm. You all came from the same waters, but why is it that only you are so strange...
Sorush: Hey!
Paimon: Paimon's not lying. When you were speaking to the Order of Skeptics, your words were kinda weird. Well, the Skeptics themselves sounded weird too. So there's that.
Paimon: Whew! Paimon thought all the other Pari were going to be exactly like you. In fact, Paimon was worried about that until we finally got to the Vourukasha Oasis and met Zurvan.
Paimon: Then, we found out that only you are like... Uh, how should Paimon put this... you have a particular way of speaking to the Order of Skeptics, right?
Traveler: It seems the Order of Skeptics had too much of an influence on her.
Sorush: Uh... I will not deny that.
Paimon: Seeing as you have no objections, Paimon will keep going. There is a big stump in the Vourukasha Oasis—
Sorush: Pale Floater, you absolute...
Paimon: Uh, it's the "Harvisptokhm" in the Vourukasha Oasis! Man, these Pari names sure are a mouthful. And, it totally is a big stump, isn't it...?
Paimon: Paimon remembers you saying that the stump is also a god, and that the Pari have a deep relationship with it.
Sorush: Though these are indeed the facts... Letting the Pale Floater describe them would be too unflattering. I shall resume the role of the speaker.
Paimon: Alright... but Paimon thought she was making it easy to understand.
Sorush: Hmph... Regardless, five hundred years ago, our great god gave all to quell the disaster afflicting this place. As such, all the Amrita here is the last gift from the divine.
Sorush: Nourished by the Amrita, the Harvisptokhm and the Pari emerged. The eldest of the Pari, and my elder... is Zurvan.
Sorush: My birth came much later, so I was not a personal witness to those events. I heard my elder speak of it but...
Sorush: Elder Zurvan clearly associated with the Order of Skeptics when they were first established, but after my birth, all contact seemed to be lost between them.
Sorush: Though my elder has long stated the importance of Pari traditions, she rarely mentions the past in detail when she speaks with me. Instead, it was the Order of Skeptics...
Sorush: Who enthusiastically shared the results of their historical research with me, and approved of my wish to follow in the footsteps of the divine bird.
Paimon: Huh? So after that, you slowly drifted away from the other Pari and learned your strange way of speaking from the Order of Skeptics?
Sorush: Oh... I suppose that can be seen as correct. Objectively speaking.
Traveler: It sounds like a rebellious phase...
Sorush: A rebellious phase... I heard the humans in the Order of Skeptics mention something about this. They said the researchers in the forest experienced a "Satyavada Life" or something like that. Is this "rebellious phase" a similar thing that humans progress through?
Traveler: Yeah, that sounds pretty similar.
Paimon: Uh, no! They're not the same thing at all!
Paimon: Generally, kids going through a rebellious phase will resist the care of their parents and try to assert their independence. That's what Paimon's heard anyway.
Paimon: Hmm, just like you did.
Sorush: Hmph. My past has little to do with my present. Whatever can be said, I have now returned to the Vourukasha Oasis and earned the Khvarena's favor.
Paimon: You're amazing, Sorush!
Sorush: Never mind, Pale Floater. It means nothing to be patronized by one as immature as you.
Sorush: That's all for today. Yasnapati, do you or the Pale Floater wish to ask anything?
Paimon: Speaking of, are the Pari and Aranara related in any way?
Sorush: ...Why do you ask this?
Traveler: Because the Pari and Aranara are both small...
Paimon: But are still capable of great things.
Black Screen Text: You describe your adventures with Arama and all the other Aranara to Sorush...
Sorush: Hmmm... How very important Festival Utsava appears to be. I heard my elder mention it once, but only thought of it as little more than a joyful gathering for the Aranara.
Sorush: But... if the Aranara have their own day, why do we Pari possess nothing of equivalence? I must mention this to my elder...
Paimon: Why do you want a Pari Festival? Is it because you can eat lots of tasty snacks during a festival?
Sorush: Of course not! The Pari Festival should... should have humans offering their odes and songs to us, while I get to choose the best singer of the lot.
Paimon: That doesn't sound like a festival at all. Well, not for the attending humans, anyway. It's more like a high-pressure competition.
Sorush: But it is an enjoyable celebration for me, yes? Hence, I believe my elder may also enjoy such an occasion.
Paimon: Perhaps... Zurvan is right. For Sorush to become a so-called Bloomguard, she might need a bit more training...
Traveler: Maybe you can think of it as a necessary process for growth...
Paimon: It's not entirely like the Satyavada Life thing that the researchers experience. In fact, Paimon's heard that plenty of human children experience it...

Paimon: You're amazing, Sorush!
Sorush: Never mind, Pale Floater. It means nothing to be patronized by one as immature as you.
Sorush: Speaking of, since we were on the topic of the Pari's birth, have you encountered the familiars of the forest?
Paimon: Familiars of the forest?
Sorush: Indeed. The ones long called the Aranara.
Sorush: I only heard them mentioned by my elders. I heard they are not free to fly as we Pari are, but with their bond to the vegetation, they can stride the mud without restraints.
Sorush: I find it hard to picture such a scene... Are they like Wenut?
Sorush: But they do have their own festival. On that arrival of their day of celebration, the Aranara will gather together and enjoy a carefree time as one.
Sorush: Sometimes I wonder, if the Aranara have their own day, why do we Pari possess nothing of equivalence? When I asked my elder, she seemed hollow of interest regarding the matter.
Paimon: Why do you want a Pari Festival? Is it because you can eat lots of tasty snacks during a festival?
Sorush: Of course not! The Pari Festival should... should have humans offering their odes and songs to us, while I get to choose the best singer of the lot.
