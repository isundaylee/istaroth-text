Monsieur Os: Hmm. Is there anything else you'd like to ask?

Traveler: This place looks like a library.
Monsieur Os: Well, more of an archive, but your description isn't off either.
Monsieur Os: Ancient theatrical scripts, music scores, all the stories of things that have and have not happened... All of them were penned down and stored here.
Monsieur Os: Someone once believed that if all the possibilities in every story were exhausted, the secrets of fate would be unveiled...
Monsieur Os: But the truth was not as complicated as he believed. Each person's fate is charted by their wishes, and the possibilities are not so great in number in the first place.
Monsieur Os: Perhaps he, too, understood that in the end...

Traveler: Tell us about Remuria...
Monsieur Os: Very well. The story begins before the Court of Fontaine as you know it was born...
Monsieur Os: The Sebastos, Remus, founded a nation above the High Sea that is Fontaine, and the ancestors of the present-day Fontainians named him the "Dark Lord Remus" in their terror.
Monsieur Os: Before it sank, this body of water was part of the Great Fontaine Lake and the location where the capital of Remuria was sited. As such, these waters have the same properties as those of Fontaine.
Monsieur Os: Unlike what you hear from most histories, the people of Remuria were not ordinary humans like the Fontainians. Rather, they were a new race, their bodies having been cast from stone, with Ichor for blood.
Monsieur Os: The Sebastos gave us such bodies in the hope that we could escape our prisons of rotting flesh and fate.
Monsieur Os: His great vision was that we should all grasp the power of the Symphony and thereby escape the shackles of Fortuna, becoming the masters of our own destiny.
Monsieur Os: We once possessed all of the High Sea, countless cities and palaces, flowers, flowing wine... and yet, fate found us all the same.
Monsieur Os: After returning from the deepest depths of the sea, the Sebastos used Ichor to create imperishable bodies for the people, and still, the prophesied future did not change.
Monsieur Os: Our God King believed that it was because human souls could not escape the gravity of fate, and so he wrote the "Symphony," a music that could weave destiny.
Monsieur Os: He believed that through this he had found a way to resist fate, but instead that path led us into utter darkness, step by step.
Monsieur Os: And in the end, the entire kingdom sank beneath the waves, as though it had been smote by divine judgment...
Monsieur Os: I fear that even he did not foresee such an outcome, though all the same, that is what happened.

Traveler: So, tell us about your impudent friend...
Monsieur Os: Boethius... He was not always evil. He was once a noble Harmost of Remuria, and the sole survivor of the catastrophe that befell us.
Monsieur Os: The original purpose of the golden castellum was to unify our surviving kin and prevent the catastrophe of the rising waters from ever occurring again. But evidently, Boethius had his own designs...
Monsieur Os: While I and my companions ranged across the land, struggling mightily to contain the power of the primordial waters, he used his eloquent tongue to sway those who remained.
Monsieur Os: He initiated a fell ritual that aimed to restore the shattered "symphony" and revive the ruined realm. To this end, he did not hesitate to dissolve the will of our kin and plunder the souls of Fontainians everywhere.
Monsieur Os: Many rulers and nobles became his pawns, and polities newly-born lay on the brink of destruction.
Monsieur Os: To stop him, who had by now clearly become a monster, I could only forsake my name and become one who hunts phantoms, resisting him alongside the Fontainians.
Monsieur Os: Bitter was the conflict before we were at last able to seal both him and the sea that had devoured our nation.
Monsieur Os: I swore upon fate that I would serve as the barrier between past and present. Thus did I become the spirit-keeper of our ancient land.
Monsieur Os: I had thought that even if evil lingered in him, his soul had long been broken, and he would remain naught but discordant notes, a "symphony" plunged into strife.
Monsieur Os: I never thought that he would weave his shattered self into the "symphony" and thus gain mastery over it. The discord and dissonance that now emanate from these waters can be regarded as an extension of his power.
Monsieur Os: If we are to defeat him... I fear we must await the moment when all his soul fragments have gathered around one body.

Traveler: Let's hear about the symphony and "Phobos"...
Monsieur Os: Where should I even begin... The "Symphony" is human memory and persona woven into a melody through musical notation, creating a song in which human souls can dwell and have their wishes fulfilled.
Monsieur Os: In that way, to master the "Symphony" is to master "fate"... This is the secret that the Great Golden Bee Sybilla, the prophet who survived the previous cycle, imparted.
Monsieur Os: The Sebastos, who created the "Symphony," poured these melodies into the insoluble Ichor, in hopes that all might control their own fates through playing that music.
Monsieur Os: He overestimated us, I fear, for his deeds terrified us... The people could not bear the burden of fate, and they begged their god and superiors for guidance.
Monsieur Os: At the request of the people, the Sebastos wrote all melodies into the grandest of melodies. This new Symphony would bring us all the greatest of happiness — and its name was "Phobos."
Monsieur Os: Had the Sebastos's plan worked, the Symphony would have woven a melody of utmost gentleness for us all — an eternity that would last a thousand years and beyond. But something went wrong...
Monsieur Os: Besides the Sebastos himself, only said superiors, the Harmosts, could have changed Phobos's melody.
Monsieur Os: And Boethius... was once an excellent Harmost.

Traveler: So, about the dreamscape I saw...
Monsieur Os: #Ah, yes, those were indeed the memories left by he whom I served, the Sebastos, the God King Remus. Though I do not understand how you were able to see them, Traveler...
Monsieur Os: But I do not think you need to worry. If this chaotic "symphony" was enough to control you, it would have done so long ago on the surface. But that has not happened, yes?
Monsieur Os: #Since you can see these things, Traveler, that means that some fragment of the Sebastos's will and memory remains in this underwater symphony.
Monsieur Os: Long millennia have I searched... and if you could touch some more of these memories, perhaps I may find the answers I have sought all this time...
Monsieur Os: The great waves could not hurt a god, even should their crests scrape the very skies. And yet, the Sebastos disappeared without a trace when our nation fell into the depths...
Monsieur Os: He would not have sat idly by as his nation and people drowned in blood... So where did he go? Or was his passing Remuria's true death knell?
Monsieur Os: ...
