# Miracle Medicine


## Talk 1

Anthony: This prescription's just getting weirder...
Traveler: How's Anna doing?
Anthony: Oh, it's you. Well, it might sound hard to believe, but Anna says that she's been feeling much better.
Anthony: Perhaps that doctor's prescription is really working? I can scarcely believe it myself.
Anthony: Well, regardless of whether it's true or not, it's best to keep going.
Anthony: The prescription this time is... Hmm. Could you help me find "Thick Condensate of a Hydro Slime"?
Traveler: This one sounds normal enough.
Anthony: Um, really? I actually think the opposite is true.
Anthony: But at least it's easy to find. I've asked around, and they say that you can get Thick Condensate just by defeating Large Slimes.
Anthony: I've heard Jack say that you can lure Large Slimes out by constantly defeating smaller ones.
Anthony: I don't have that kind of combat skill, so I'm counting on you!
Traveler: Don't worry, this one might be edible.
Anthony: And how do you know that? Have you tried it before? ...Um, why aren't you saying anything?
Anthony: Whatever. Hydro Slimes should be quite easy to find. I've asked around, and others have said that you can get Thick Condensate by defeating Large Slimes.
Anthony: I've heard Jack say that you can lure Large Slimes out by constantly defeating smaller ones.
Anthony: I don't have that kind of combat skill, so I'm counting on you!
Traveler: I know where to get some.
Anthony: Well, that's good. Looks like you're well-versed in dealing with Slimes.
Anthony: Thanks for agreeing to help. You should be able to get some Thick Condensate just by defeating Large Slimes.
Anthony: I've heard Jack say that you can lure Large Slimes out by constantly defeating smaller ones.
Anthony: Well then, best of luck to you.

## Talk 2

Anthony: Have you found it yet?
Traveler: Not yet, no.
Anthony: Well, it is combat we're talking about. Take some time to prepare, and I'll see you again.

## Talk 3

Anthony: Have you found it yet?
Traveler: I sure have.
Anthony: This... really does look quite rich.
Anthony: Can you really use this to make medicine? I'll try it myself once it's done.
Anthony: If anything happens to me, please take Anna...
Anthony: ...and place her in the care of Sister Grace.
Anthony: Tell her that I've gone to work somewhere far abroad. Please, that is my final request.
Traveler: Hey, hey. You're giving yourself a scare.
Anthony: But this medicine does look that scary! Whatever the case, take this first.
Anthony: And remember what I said!
