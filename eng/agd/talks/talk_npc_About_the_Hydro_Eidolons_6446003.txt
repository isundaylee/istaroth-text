Traveler: About the Hydro Eidolons...
Zosimos: The Hydro Eidolons, right? They can't speak, but... "We" have our ways of communicating.
Zosimos: To me, they are extremely reliable partners.
Zosimos: In fact, the outdoor stages simply can't function without them. If you have time, you should see for yourself.
Zosimos: As for the stories... Hehe, most were written by yours truly. As always, your honest feedback would be greatly appreciated.
