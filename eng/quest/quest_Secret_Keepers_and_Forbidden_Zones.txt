# Secret Keepers and Forbidden Zones


## Talk 1

Freminet: I—I'm so sorry, Lyney...
Lynette: I'm also really sorry, Lyney. I should have been more careful.
Lyney: Don't say that. It was all my fault... I was the one who should have been more careful. You two were nearly...
Freminet: If I was stronger... Maybe I would have already found Master Childe...
Lyney: No, how can you say that?
Freminet: Hmm?
Lyney: ...I'm sorry...
Lynette: What I'm hearing is, we all dropped the ball at some point during the mission, so the responsibility falls on all of us. Isn't that right?
Freminet: Yeah, that's right. It's on all of us.
Lyney: ...
Lynette: Lyney, we understand that you're worried about us, but we're worried about you as well. Please don't blame yourself... We want you to keep your spirits up.
Lyney: ...Yeah.

## Talk 2

Sigewinne: Excuse me~
Wriothesley: I take it Mr. Freminet's condition has stabilized?
Sigewinne: Of course. I would not have left the infirmary otherwise.
Wriothesley: I've been expecting those two, but might I enquire as to the purpose of your visit, Miss Sigewinne?
Sigewinne: I wanted to check up on Miss Clorinde. How are you feeling?
Clorinde: Mostly fine, I think.
Sigewinne: If you don't mind, I'd like to perform another quick physical exam. It'll just take a few minutes.
Clorinde: Alright, thank you for looking out for me. I'll take my leave for now, then.
Paimon: Well, want to explain yourself, Wriothesley?
Wriothesley: Haha, of course, but I'm not partial to the word choice of "explain." How about "enlighten"?
Traveler: Please enlighten us as much as you'd like.
Wriothesley: But where should I begin? How about you start by asking me any questions you have? You can start with whichever one you'd like to get answered the most.
Paimon: Hmm... Then Paimon will begin. Did you know about Lyney's goals from the very beginning?
Wriothesley: No, I just knew they were Fatui operatives sent to the Fortress by The Knave. As for their specific goals... I only figured those out as you made progress on your investigation.
Paimon: You managed to monitor and stay ahead of them even though you didn't know what they were trying to do?
Wriothesley: They came here with ulterior motives. I'm quite adept at discerning what that kind of behavior signals.
Traveler: Why didn't you stop them?
Wriothesley: Initially, I thought their goal was just to investigate Childe's disappearance.
Wriothesley: Lyney suggested that I had deliberately let him escape, but in truth, I didn't really do anything special to help or hinder him while he was here. Everything he did, from finding helpers to leaving this place, he did on his own.
Wriothesley: Of course, it's inevitable that The Knave would make a big deal out of her fellow Harbinger's unexplained disappearance.
Wriothesley: I'm also quite curious about where that Harbinger went, so I figured I might as well let the Fatui do their own investigative work. All I care about is the answer.
Paimon: So you were hoping Lyney's group would just do your work for you...
Wriothesley: You make it sound like that's a bad thing... Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned. I assume that Freminet has told you already — the ratio of Primordial Seawater around the Fortress of Meropide is on the rise.
Wriothesley: The forbidden zone has always been Lyney's target, and you got roped into that investigation after running into him. I began to intervene out of concern for your safety, and also to prevent the Fortress from becoming entangled in more irksome matters.
Paimon: Are the rumors true? That you're also a former criminal?
Wriothesley: Why would you put it like that? Isn't staying here all day and serving as the manager of the Fortress a kind of sentence unto itself, another form of prison? I just happen to have some support from the rest of the inmates, that's all.
Paimon: Oh right, Paimon wanted to ask — who invited Clorinde down here?
Wriothesley: Me, of course. I paid her good Mora to come down to the Fortress for some field work.
Wriothesley: As a Champion Duelist, Miss Clorinde can be considered to be an independent party. I needed to find an exceptionally capable person to help me get through the impending crisis.
Paimon: And saving Freminet was part of that crisis?
Wriothesley: You can think of it like that, yes. Credit where credit is due, that boy is quite adept at diving. Had conditions not been as hostile as they were, he probably would have found the missing Harbinger already.
Traveler: So, the forbidden zone really exists?
Wriothesley: That's not something you should be asking after. Neuvillette only asked you to investigate Childe's whereabouts.
Wriothesley: All I need to prove to you is that the forbidden zone had nothing to do with the Harbinger's disappearance. That should be clear now that you've spoken to Freminet.
Paimon: But... we've already uncovered that there's something wrong with the infirmary, and we've answered a bunch of questions that you threw at us... Isn't it about time that you answer our last question in return?
Wriothesley: You make a compelling case... Do you really want to know the answer that badly?
Paimon: Yeah! Paimon really wants to know!
Wriothesley: Even if the truth may not be pleasant?
Traveler: ...Yes.
Wriothesley: Follow me.
Traveler: What's inside of it?

## Talk 3

Paimon: There's a hidden door here!? And a whole basement behind it? You're pretty good at hiding stuff, Wriothesley.
Wriothesley: It seems you've forgotten just what kind of place the Fortress of Meropide is.

## Talk 4

Wriothesley: Stand on the central plate.
Paimon: Wait, is there a secret mechanism or — whoa!!
Black Screen Text: Once everyone has taken their positions on the circular plate, it begins to slowly move downwards...

## Talk 5

Paimon: So this is the "forbidden zone"? Honestly, for a place so well-hidden, Paimon sure doesn't see anything special...
Traveler: And that is...
Paimon: What a huge door!
Wriothesley: There are three such isolation gates in total. Generally speaking, I'm the only one who's allowed to go inside. Hence the name, "forbidden zone."
Wriothesley: Am I correct to assume you're going to run on back and tell your little Fatui friends everything?
Paimon: Well, er, Paimon wasn't thinking of keeping anything from them...
Wriothesley: Hah. Well, I'd advise you wait until you've seen the whole truth of this place for yourself before deciding whether or not to tell them.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Huh, so there's a switch on the side...
Wriothesley: Stand back.
Paimon: Whoa... They all just went up one by one...
Traveler: What's that in the middle of the room?
Wriothesley: Go on, have a look.

## Talk 7

Traveler: (This room is really empty with nothing in here, which is quite strange on its own. There's also a device smack dab in the middle of the room, which looks like some kind of massive sluice gate.)
Wriothesley: I've been interested in what lies beyond that gate ever since I assumed leadership of the Fortress of Meropide. Of course, it would be unwise to recklessly open it, but it'd also be risky and negligent to simply ignore any potential danger that could be behind it.
Wriothesley: The readings on that dashboard haven't budged since the day when I first laid eyes on this place. But over the past year, the needle has crept upwards from its original position, likely because some parameter it's been tracking has changed, if only infinitesimally.
Wriothesley: Normally, I would have ignored it, but I happened to have some free time when I noticed it, so I investigated. Any guesses what the reading could be tracking?
Traveler: The water pressure?
Wriothesley: Very reasonable guesses. I've considered both of those as well. Unfortunately, our dashboard is tracking something less ordinary.
Wriothesley: The temperature should vary with weather and climate changes, so for something that rarely shifts, the water pressure is more likely. We ran a few tests to increase the pressure from the outside, but the readings didn't change at all.
Wriothesley: Later on, a few more possibilities occurred to me, such as a potential connection with the Primordial Sea. I began to make a few preparations based on that hypothesis.
Wriothesley: Over the past few days, the needle has moved again. With that and the symptoms that Freminet displayed after leaving the Fortress, I can now confidently conclude that the readings represent the concentration of Primordial Seawater in the seawater nearby.
Paimon: The concentration of... Primordial Seawater!? But we're already under the sea...
Wriothesley: And that is precisely the problem. We're at the bottom of the sea, and now we're surrounded by toxic seawater. Somehow, Primordial Seawater got mixed in, and the concentration is steadily rising...
Traveler: ...Primordial Seawater is continually leaking into the sea?
Wriothesley: Yes, that's very likely.
Paimon: But forget about the two of us, not even Neuvillette knows where the Primordial Sea could be, much less where we could find and plug a leak...
Paimon: ...Oh... OH!
Wriothesley: Seems like you've figured it out.
Wriothesley: I believe the Primordial Sea lies directly beneath this sluice gate. For some reason, the Primordial Seawater levels have risen significantly, and it's now very close to us.
Wriothesley: The indicators are now red. Although the gate still stands, some Primordial Seawater has already leaked out and mixed into the sea around us.
Wriothesley: ...If this continues, soon it will no longer be able to hold back the Primordial Sea at all.
Traveler: And if the Primordial Sea is leaking through...
Wriothesley: Yeah, you know what the legends say. If this place falls, then everyone in Fontaine will be turned into puddles in the span of a night.
Paimon: But that's just too weird! Why would the Fortress of Meropide be built right above a sluice gate for the Primordial Sea? Who built this place, anyway?
Wriothesley: Your expression tells me you think this might be part of a vast, complicated conspiracy. To be honest, you might find the actual answer may be exceedingly boring.
Wriothesley: It's just that the secret of the "forbidden zone" had been long forgotten by the nation before I rediscovered it with my research.
Wriothesley: There's no single "founder" of the Fortress of Meropide in any traditional sense. What we know about its history has been left to us by the people who used to live here.
Wriothesley: When the previous Hydro Archon, Egeria, ruled the land, all convicted criminals from Fontaine were exiled. The people drove the criminals away like a wolf pack chasing away the banished.
Wriothesley: The criminals received no sympathy of any kind from the people. They were exiled to the desolate seaside, where they experienced only pain, struggle, and the bone-chilling cold.
Wriothesley: Some of them began to repent, and prayed to the Hydro Archon, asking if there was still anything they could do. The Hydro Archon took pity on them, and said: You may go guard my secret, deep underneath the waves.
Wriothesley: And so, leaning on the power of the Hydro Archon, they gathered underneath the sea, and began to build a fortress. They became a community down there in the deeps, and over the years, helped it to grow.
Wriothesley: As the number of exiles increased, more and more people joined the community. When the first group of exiles died, they left the yet-unfinished fortress to their successors.
Wriothesley: The Hydro Archon continued to lend her support, allowing the fortress and what it stood for to continue growing ever larger. Before long, this dark underwater fortress became the sinners' only home.
Wriothesley: And with that, the people here stopped referring to the Fortress as a prison. They saw themselves as repenting sinners, who would regain their freedom once they had sufficiently redeemed themselves.
Wriothesley: But as time went on, people also realized that the Fortress was a lonely place. Once they had gotten used to life here, they could no longer feel comfortable living in the overworld.
Wriothesley: Once they had finished serving their sentences, some people left, and some others chose to stay. They'd find some idle position, and let their withered souls fade away with the ancient secrets of the past.
Wriothesley: ...After many, many centuries, few people still remember the reason for the Fortress' founding. Now, they just see it as an integral pillar of Fontainian society, as the place where criminals deserve to be sent.
Wriothesley: Now and again, researchers manage to break one law or another, and live out their days in the Fortress. I learned all this from an elderly historian — everyone else just thought he'd made it all up.
Paimon: But now you know, every part of that history is true...
Wriothesley: Indeed. It's just as the prophecy says. If this gate fails, then everyone will be dissolved into the sea.
Traveler: Do you believe in prophecies?
Wriothesley: To be frank, not really. But sadly, that hasn't stopped this prophecy from proving all too accurate.
Wriothesley: Prophecies are troublesome things. Just hearing one will create the first wave of panic. Seeing signs of it will bring about the second, and actually witnessing it in real time, the third.
Traveler: So, as the Duke of Meropide, just what do you plan to do about it?
Wriothesley: Let's go somewhere else. I want to show you something.
Traveler: If this gate falls, all of Fontaine will fall with it.
Traveler: The temperature?

## Talk 8

Wriothesley: This is it.
Jurieu: Your Grace! Perfect timing. The results from our latest round of experiments have—
Lourvine: Wait, Jurieu, he's not alone!
Paimon: Huh? Lourvine and Jurieu?
Wriothesley: No need to panic, you two. I've already told them about our plan.
Lourvine: What? After you warned us not to tell a single soul about any of this!?
Jurieu: I'm skeptical as well. Are you sure they are trustworthy?
Wriothesley: The results speak for themselves, don't they? These two may already know more than you could ever imagine.
Jurieu: ...Alright then, if Your Grace insists.
Lourvine: They seem harmless enough... So I'll trust them for now.
Wriothesley: How about some reintroductions... This is Jurieu, one of the highest-ranked researchers from the Fontaine Research Institute. He used to work under Edwin. I trust that you've heard of Edwin?
Traveler: Yeah, we have.
Wriothesley: Good. Saves me a bit of time explaining.
Wriothesley: Edwin's main areas of research were Arkhium and gravimeters. As his assistant, Jurieu is quite familiar with them as well. I hired him to be my technical consultant.
Paimon: You... you want to blow up the Fortress of Meropide?
Wriothesley: Ah, what a lovely idea. I'm already imagining it in my head.
Jurieu: Gotta admit, I'm tempted as well...
Lourvine: Guys, focus! Focus!
Wriothesley: That taskmaster over here is Miss Lourvine and is also one of my technical consultants. While Jurieu used to be Edwin's assistant, she used to be Jurieu's assistant.
Paimon: Oh, are they together?
Traveler: Was that really necessary?
Wriothesley: See, everyone keeps asking this question. Are you two sure you're not a couple, and just using your work as a convenient cover?
Lourvine: I... Your Grace, I am NOT in a relationship with this man!
Jurieu: If I dated her, I'd officially be madder than Edwin!
Wriothesley: Jeez, forget I said anything, then.
Wriothesley: Follow me.
Paimon: Whoa, there's another door that goes right up!
Wriothesley: Your constant amazement makes it seem like the Fortress can do anything.
Paimon: But Paimon really thinks everything's super cool!
Traveler: Is this just a normal room?
Wriothesley: Let's spice it up a bit.
Wriothesley: And here you go.
Traveler: This is...!?
Paimon: What a huge... ship?
Paimon: This is also a production zone that Paimon's never seen before... What's going on?
Wriothesley: How much do you know about Fontainian history?
Paimon: Er... Not much at all...
Wriothesley: Then maybe you haven't heard of the story of ancient Remuria. To give you a quick rundown, Fontaine used to be ruled by the Remurian Dynasty.
Wriothesley: According to legend, the Remurian King, Remus, came to this land after being inspired by divine revelation, and found the seer Sybilla, who had taken on the form of a Golden Bee. Taking the Golden Bee with him and riding on a huge ship, the Fortuna, he created his nation above the surging waves.
Wriothesley: He called his nation "Remuria," and used the Fortuna to incessantly search for new tribes and islands, calling on them to join his empire.
Paimon: There's a ship in this story, too...?
Wriothesley: Where there's water, there will be ships. People believe that hope can always be found at the end of a voyage.
Paimon: Do you believe that, too?
Wriothesley: To a point, I think. As you've already seen, I have a whole factory's worth of labor, materials, and technology at my disposal. Certainly can't hurt to give it a try.
Wriothesley: So, the moment I began to speculate that the Primordial Sea might lie underneath the gate, I also began this project.
Paimon: Were you inspired by the legendary Fortuna?
Wriothesley: Maybe. Fontainians need something to hold on to to cope with the impending disaster.
Traveler: This is a plan for the ages...
Wriothesley: Were the workers to find out the truth behind this ship, riots would destroy the Fortress faster than any catastrophe.
Wriothesley: As the Fortress' administrator, I would never make such a reckless call.
Wriothesley: Alright, that's enough talking for now. I'll need another three cups of tea to soothe my throat. Do you have any other questions?
Wriothesley: Seems like you're good. Come on, I'll take you back.
Traveler: Can't you share your plan with everyone?
Traveler: Edwho?
Jurieu: He's the one who blew the whole Institute sky high. Everyone knew he was a bit crooked in the head, but you're not a local, so I guess it's possible for you not to have heard of him.

## Talk 9

Wriothesley: I'll leave you here for now.
Paimon: Oh! Uh... Thank you so much.
Wriothesley: No worries. But don't forget, it's up to you whether or not you want to share what you just saw. What you do from here on out will likely affect those three as well.
Traveler: (He means that my actions now will decide the next steps Lyney's group takes.)
Traveler: (...In other words, if I want to tell Lyney the truth, I must make him understand that we cannot afford excessive conflict right now.)
Paimon: Yeah, we'll put a lot of thought into it for sure!
Traveler: Yeah, we will.
Wriothesley: Great. I look forward to what happens next.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: Wow Itto, you really captured them!
Kappa: Seriously, why didn't you run when I told you?
Youko: What're you saying... We couldn't abandon you!
Hitotsume Kozou: Yeah, that's right! So just get on with it... If you're gonna eat us, then you'll have to deal with all three of us!
Hitotsume Kozou: We won't back down, even if... even if we're already in your stomach!
Paimon: Who said we were going to eat you? Wait, are you the ghosts of something tasty?
Paimon: And Itto, why're you so quiet all of a sudden?
Arataki Itto: Hmm... I have a weird feeling that I've seen these three somewhere before...
Arataki Itto: Ah, I know! These are all creatures from the Ultimate Youkai Field Guide that granny used to show me!
Arataki Itto: There's Youko, Kappa, and Hitotsume Kozou! They're all youkai.
Youko: It sure took you long enough to notice.
Kappa: Well, we recognized you right away! You're an oni, aren't you?
Hitotsume Kozou: According to legends, oni are grouchy, extremely strong, and crush other youkai into balls to eat them up!
Arataki Itto: Pfff! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard! Who came up with that!?
Arataki Itto: Besides, you're the ones people are scared of! Hiding behind bushes and scaring people off the road, what are you trying to do here?
Arataki Itto: #Don't think I didn't see you! ...Following {M#him}{F#her} around and conjuring up all sorts of weird, scary stuff.
Paimon: Aha, so it was you three!
Kappa: No, we weren't trying to scare anyone. We were just trying to, uh...
Youko: ...
Hitotsume Kozou: ...
Traveler: Go ahead, you can tell us.
Hitotsume Kozou: Really? You're not mad?
Paimon: Even though you scared the daylights out of Paimon a few times, it doesn't seem like you were doing it on purpose.
Paimon: Anyway, let's hear your side of the story and Paimon will decide whether or not to forgive you!
Youko: Ahem, well, the truth is... we were planning a festival.
Youko: One hosted by the youkai, but humans are also welcome to attend.
Traveler: You mean, the Mikawa Flower Festival?
Paimon: Ah, the festival that Ei mentioned!
Arataki Itto: Mikawa Flower Festival... huh, that does ring a bell.
Arataki Itto: Ah right, it used to be hosted by the top youkai. I heard it was supposed to be a lot of fun... I mean, not as fun as my Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival, but still...
Youko: Yes, the Mikawa Flower Festival is our aspiration... But we know that our festival doesn't deserve that name.
Youko: The times of Hyakkiyakou are long gone, we're just a bunch of little youkai living in the wilderness.
Youko: As you can see, we lack the necessary youkai powers to put on such a grand festival.
Youko: But... we're determined to still reach out to humans and express our gratitude.
Paimon: Huh? Gratitude? What do you mean?
Kappa: Mm-hmm. You see, we live in the wilderness and are frequently attacked by monsters.
Kappa: They would come and stir up trouble on our land, forcing us to hand over our food... Sometimes they would even get rough and leave us injured.
Kappa: But later, many human adventurers came into the wilderness and drove off the monsters, allowing us to live in peace.
Arataki Itto: Ah, I get it now. You wanna repay the favor, but your powers are too puny!
Arataki Itto: Hey, don't let it get to ya. You might be a bunch of pip-squeaks, but you're all solid youkai in my book!
Paimon: So are you the ones who set up the Akitsu Yuugei game on the beach?
Hitotsume Kozou: Yep, that was us! Have you tried it yet? Isn't it fun?
Hitotsume Kozou: We drew inspiration from the legendary Akitsu Haz{RUBY#[S]Haneasobi}ura. It took a lot of youkai power to set it up.
Hitotsume Kozou: After that, we didn't have much youkai power left, so we set up some stalls in the forest to add to the festival atmosphere...
Youko: We were just following you to see your reactions.
Paimon: Is the Akitsu Yuugei really that important? Why did you spend all of your youkai power to build it?
Paimon: #Paimon would have taken {NICKNAME} for a big meal if you had set up more food stalls!
Hitotsume Kozou: Really?
Youko: To be honest, we've never met a human before, so we had no idea what you would like...
Youko: We focused on building the Akitsu Yuugei because of a legend we heard.
Arataki Itto: Ah, I know the one!
Youko: It's the story of youkai meeting a human during a festival hundreds of years ago.
Youko: The Mikawa Flower Festival is meant to bring happiness to all who attend, and Akitsu Haz{RUBY#[S]Haneasobi}ura is a symbol of friendship.
Youko: That's why, when we decided to hold the festival here, setting up Akitsu Haz{RUBY#[S]Haneasobi}ura was our first priority.
Youko: Unfortunately, the real Akitsu Haz{RUBY#[S]Haneasobi}ura has been lost to time. What we created is a version of the game we heard about from a wandering merchant, so we changed the name to Akitsu Yuugei.
Traveler: We heard that someone had been trapped in Akitsu Yuugei.
Hitotsume Kozou: Yeah, but that wasn't us!
Kappa: We have no idea what could have gone wrong!
Youko: We closed Akitsu Yuugei a while ago and carefully checked it for any issues.
Youko: But, we didn't find anything wrong with it... Maybe it was just some strange mishap caused by our unstable youkai power at the time.
Arataki Itto: Hmm, they don't look like they're lying, and believe me, I know a liar when I see one! Maybe it really was just an accident.
Hitotsume Kozou: After that incident, people stopped coming to the attraction.
Kappa: Later, a human man with blue hair appeared and walked around the area...
Youko: He had a piercing gaze, I almost felt like he could see us.
Youko: But then he turned and quickly left without saying anything.
Hitotsume Kozou: It wasn't long before large numbers of people began coming to the Chinju Forest!
Hitotsume Kozou: And visitors were playing Akitsu Yuugei again. It was wonderful.
Paimon: "A human man with blue hair"...?
Traveler: It must have been Ayato.
Paimon: Now that you mention it, the fan that Ayato chose is the same kind that's used at a festival... Do you think that he knew about the youkai when he decided to hold the Test of Courage here?
Arataki Itto: Oh, so my bro Ayato is here for the Test of Courage, too?
Arataki Itto: Or maybe he's here to catch Onikabuto... Ha, had I known that, I would have brought the one I caught a few days ago to battle him!
Paimon: Wow, Itto's still clueless about who Ayato really is...
Traveler: It's alright, no need to tell him for now.
Paimon: Well anyway, seems like all the strange things we saw earlier were caused by these little youkai, not ghosts. What a relief...
Paimon: And now that we know what was happening, the Test of Courage doesn't seem that scary after all!
Arataki Itto: Hey, you want to hang out with humans, right? I totally get that.
Arataki Itto: After all, we youkai are becoming a rare breed these days. If all we do is isolate, we'll only feel more lonely. So, why don't you let this oni do ya a favor, hmm?
Arataki Itto: See, I'm a youkai too, right, and I'm already a natural in human society. I bet there's not a single person in Inazuma who hasn't heard of Arataki "The One and Oni" Itto!
Arataki Itto: Hahaha! C'mon, let's go! I'll show you around!
Paimon: Now that Paimon doesn't feel so scared anymore, maybe we can walk around the area?
Paimon: The youkai said they wanted to host a festival, but Paimon was too busy having the bejeebers scared out of her to pay any attention until now.
Paimon: Come to think of it, Paimon remembers seeing some festival-related items on the beach... Let's head over there and take a look. Maybe we can help out!
Traveler: Maybe we can help you.

### Additional Talk 2

Arataki Itto: Don't freak out, boys! Whatever happens, I'll protect you!
Akira: You're the best, Boss!

### Additional Talk 3

Kamisato Ayaka: Ah, after hearing Chizuru describe the original Mikawa Flower Festival, I wanted to arrange another chance to talk with her about it.
Kamisato Ayaka: I didn't expect that would be our last conversation...
