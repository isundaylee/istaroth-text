Traveler: So, what are your plans going forward?
Anthony: Me? Well, since Anna's illness has been taking a turn for the better, I can probably take some more relaxed work as compared to before.
Anthony: I was really busy then, and didn't have time to spend with Anna at all. I have to change that.
Anthony: Unless you mean my picking Mora at midnight â€” in which case, well, every little bit was a gain. But I won't do that anymore. I only did it then on account of my younger sister's illness, anyway.
