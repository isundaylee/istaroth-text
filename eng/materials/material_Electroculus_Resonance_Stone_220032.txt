# Electroculus Resonance Stone

A stone that can be used in Inazuma to search for nearby Electroculi.
This strange device can resonate with Electro Statues of The Seven. Due to this trait, it can detect the presence of Electroculi.
Across the span of endless years, even the most majestic cities and sculptures would be worn down by wind and rain, and even the power of Statues of The Seven would gradually dissipate. But this faded strength would coalesce once more into the Oculi, which call out wordlessly to their Statues.
