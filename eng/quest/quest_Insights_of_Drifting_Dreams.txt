# Insights of Drifting Dreams


## Talk 1

Pervases: The spirit soars the mountains high, while the body rests as the world goes by...
Paimon: Um... Sorry to interrupt you, but...
Traveler: We'd like to borrow a censer and some lamps.
Pervases: Well I'll be... Isn't that something?
Pervases: A pair walk into a shrine, neither to seek nor worship gods or adepti, but to pilfer the tools of worship for their own ends. Hahaha...
Paimon: We know it's rude to ask, but we just need them for a short while — honest!
Pervases: For the Dream Trawler ritual, I trust?
Paimon: Wha— How'd you know that?
Pervases: I have been in this shrine for far longer than you would expect.
Pervases: Perhaps as a reward for my faithfulness, I have been endowed with some understanding of the adepti arts.
Paimon: Wow. Paimon's never heard of that happening before.
Pervases: Ah, it matters not. Take what you need. It is a fortuitous thing that these items may be of service to you.
Pervases: ...They served little purpose here, in any case.
Traveler: Something on your mind?
Pervases: Heh, nothing that you need concern yourself with. Please, take what you wish.
Traveler: Well... thanks, then!
Pervases: You are quite welcome. Please, take what you wish.

## Talk 2

Paimon: This censer... should be fine... right?
Paimon: At least it isn't as run-down as this shrine.
Paimon: So next... we just need to grab the Seven-Star Lamps, right? The sooner we start, the sooner we'll be done.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Huh? Where'd he go!? He was right here...
Paimon: I had presumed that once you had acquired what you came for, you would forget about me and simply be on your way...
Paimon: Ah! It's that guy's voice! ...Hello? Wh—Where are you?
Paimon: My physical form ceased to exist over a thousand years ago. What you witnessed earlier was an illusion, created by the adepti art known as Mortal Lingering.
Paimon: Now that you have taken the Seven-Star Lamps and censer used in the Mortal Lingering ritual, my form is no longer visible to you.
Traveler: So you're...
Paimon: I was once a junior in the order of the yakshas, bestowed with the name Pervases by Rex Lapis himself. Yet my strength failed, and I was slain in battle.
Paimon: Today is the anniversary of my death. My last wish was to see a modern Liyue, and so I took the liberty of performing this ritual here.
Paimon: That aside... You were sent here by the Conqueror of Demons, were you not?
Paimon: So, you two know each other then?
Paimon: I sense his aura upon you... that, and the heavy burden of his karma.
Paimon: *sigh* Even after all these millennia, he still must endure such tremendous suffering?
Paimon: ...I am truly ashamed.
Paimon: Don't say that, Pervases — you sacrificed your life for Liyue, didn't you?
Paimon: Life is a precious thing, yes... But when I think of the burden that the Conqueror of Demons must bear... *sigh* death seems to me to have been the easy way out. A selfish indulgence, even.
Paimon: Pervases...
Paimon: Haha, I apologize. Birthdays are joyful occasions, but by the same token, it is hard to not be melancholy on the anniversary of one's death.
Paimon: The Mortal Lingering will not last much longer. Take care, you two, and please pass on my regards to the Conqueror of Demons...
Traveler: We will!
Paimon: *sigh* If only I could taste some authentic Grilled Ticker Fish once more...
Paimon: By wave and storm I hunt for fish, by wind and snow I slay evil...
Paimon: ...
Paimon: Huh? Looks like he's gone, then... Paimon really hopes that at least someone will remember Pervases the Yaksha.
Paimon: We should get going. But let's come back here and make an offering sometime.
Traveler: You take care too, Pervases...
Traveler: Y—Y—You're a g—g—ghost?
Paimon: Haha... It is not untrue to say this. The line between adepti and ghosts is a fine one indeed.

## Talk 4

Xiao: Have you gathered the items for the ritual?
Xiao: Hmm... This censer, and these lamps... Their designs are flawless, almost as if they were made specifically for use in the adepti arts. Where did you come by them?
Traveler: We got them from a yaksha named Pervases...
Paimon: Oh! And um, he says hi!
Xiao: Pervases...
Xiao: ...Yes, this does have the hallmarks of something Pervases might do.
Xiao: As I thought, it seems that he could not leave Liyue behind either... I hope that its present state will allow him to rest in peace.
Xiao: Well then. Let us begin preparing for the ritual.
Xiao: Place the censer in the middle, and surround it with the Seven-Star Lamps. Adorn the area with the items of abject cold. Once this is done, we shall proceed.
Xiao: Yes, this will do. Now, the next step is the key to performing Dream Trawler...
Xiao: There are four steps to performing this ritual: offering incense, meditation, incantation, and loosing an arrow.
Paimon: Ah... Seems like a real rigmarole.
Xiao: Adepti arts are the product of millennia of study by adepti. Do not dismiss their mystical workings as "rigmarole."
Xiao: Failure to take this seriously could cause the technique to devour one's own body, or cause the spirit to be sundered from one's flesh permanently...
Paimon: Agh! Stop talking! Paimon's sorry!
Xiao: When offering the incense, we place the incense into the censer with reverence for Rex Lapis in our hearts.
Xiao: Meditation is to empty ourselves of trivial thoughts, and to focus on the target of the art we are performing.
Xiao: Then, we shall recite the incantation in a loud voice: "Devayaksha, Bring Forth Sin!"
Xiao: Finally, we will loose an arrow towards each of the yaksha statues to enlist their authority for our contract.
Xiao: If all goes well, Starsnatcher's soul will be brought forth shortly.
Traveler: Understood.
Xiao: If you have no other questions, let us begin.
Paimon: Hmm... Well... let's start by offering up incense, shall we? You know, with respect for Rex Lapis and everything...
Traveler: *gulps*

## Talk 5

Paimon: Then we meditate... Ugh, Paimon really doesn't wanna think about that fraud!
Traveler: Hmm...
Paimon: Hmm...
Traveler: Ohh...
Paimon: Ohh...
Traveler: Ahh... Hmm...
Paimon: Ahh... Hmm...
Traveler: Devayaksha, Bring Forth Sin!
Paimon: Uh, bring forth sin!

## Talk 6

Paimon: We finished the ritual, and we followed all the instructions to the letter!
Xiao: ...Close enough.
Xiao: Leave the rest to me. You two get ready to greet him.
Starsnatcher: Where is one... Huh? You two look familiar.
Starsnatcher: What's with one's body? One feels... light. Weightless!
Traveler: We summoned your spirit forth with an adepti art.
Starsnatcher: An adepti art? Hahaha! You dare don the guise of an adeptus in one's presence?
Starsnatcher: But as for the matter of one's present location... One could have sworn that one was dozing off to sleep at Wangshu Inn not a moment ago...
Starsnatcher: Wait... that must be it... of course it must! Haha, as expected of an adeptus such as oneself...
Starsnatcher: One must indeed be in a dream!
Paimon: Ugh, there's no helping this guy, is there?
Traveler: Oh, you're not dreaming.
Starsnatcher: Huh? What is the meaning of this? Do you truly think that one will permit such insolence in one's own dreams?
Paimon: ...Alright, time to take him down a peg.
Traveler: Dreamers, after all, feel no pain.
Traveler: Guess what? You're already dead.
Starsnatcher: Dead!?
Starsnatcher: Impossible! One was just lying in peaceful repose at Wangshu Inn...

## Talk 7

Starsnatcher: P—Please, stop! I surrender, I surrender! Argh...
Traveler: So, do you believe us now?
Starsnatcher: Yes! Yes, I do! I thought I was going to die...
Starsnatcher: How did I ever have the misfortune to meet you two...
Starsnatcher: Please, great adepti, spare my life. I won't do this ever again, I swear it...
Paimon: We did call your spirit here, but we're not adepti. He, however, is.
Xiao: You deceive the masses with quackery, masquerade as an adeptus, exorcise demons without exterminating them, and display a callous lack of regard for life.
Xiao: One day, you will reap that which you have sown... For those who invite the infernal into their lives, there is no redemption!
Starsnatcher: Ah... I... You're...
Paimon: Seems like Xiao's got him scared stiff.
Starsnatcher: O great adeptus... might I ask your name?
Traveler: He is the Conqueror of Demons.
Starsnatcher: It really is you! It's truly you! Never in my life did I imagine that I might meet the Conqueror of Demons, the Vigilant Yaksha himself!
Paimon: You know about Xiao?
Starsnatcher: Of course! My grandfather was a folklorist — I learned the tales of the Conqueror of Demons at his knee...
Starsnatcher: To this day, I am an avid collector of books concerning the yakshas.
Starsnatcher: But ever since I discovered a Sigil of Permission while rummaging through my grandfather's personal effects...
Starsnatcher: At first, I was just imitating the adepti for fun... but slowly I began to stray further and further from the righteous path...
Paimon: Huh, so to sum you up... you're Xiao's biggest fan?
Starsnatcher: Y—Yes. Thank you both for allowing me to witness the Conqueror of Demons in the flesh — it's like a dream come true!
Paimon: Uh, that wasn't quite our intention...
Starsnatcher: Please allow me to swear this oath before the Great Conqueror of Demons...
Starsnatcher: I swear to turn away from evil, to live an honest life, and to never again stain the name of the adepti!
Xiao: I will remember your oath... Now go.
Starsnatcher: Thank you... A thousand thanks for your forgiveness... and for all that you have done for Liyue...
Paimon: He seemed very earnest when he was making that oath there. Guess he won't be tricking anyone anymore.
Paimon: Oh, wait! We haven't gotten the Sigil of Permission back yet. Let's head over to Wangshu Inn first thing tomorrow and look for him!
Traveler: He is the Vigilant Yaksha.
Traveler: So, are we still going to do this "oneself" song and dance?
Starsnatcher: N—No, no, never again! Y—You almost killed me...

## Talk 8

Paimon: Hey there, Boss. Starsnatcher's staying here, right?
Verr Goldet: Starsnatcher... Hm... You mean the false adeptus who wore a mask?
Verr Goldet: He signed in here under the name Wang Ping'an.
Traveler: That's a... really normal name.
Verr Goldet: He's already checked out. He said he wished to go on a solo pilgrimage...
Verr Goldet: Ah, yes. He also requested that I give this letter to a traveler who journeys together with a "talking fairy"... should they come asking for him.
Paimon: Talking fairy... Who's that?
Verr Goldet: ...Well anyway, you must be the traveler. Here's the letter.
Paimon: How strange that he would leave a letter for us. Is this the final attempt to fool us, maybe?
Paimon: Come on, open it! Paimon's curious!
Paimon: ...
Paimon: Huh, seems like he actually left us a few nice trinkets...
Paimon: Along with... Woohoo! The Sigil of Permission!
Paimon: Paimon hasn't met a bad guy like him in a long time...
Traveler: I'm actually quite touched...
Paimon: Yeah... Anyway, let's go take this Sigil of Permission to Xiao, shall we?
Traveler: This is all thanks to Xiao.
Traveler: So a really, really ordinary person after all.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Ah! There you are.
Paimon: We got the Sigil of Permission back. Do you wanna take it?
Xiao: You have my thanks.
Xiuhua: May I take your order, sir?
Xiao: One Grilled Ticker Fish.
Xiuhua: Certainly, we'll prepare it for you immediately!
Paimon: Huh? No Almond Tofu this time? Well that's not like Xiao.
Xiao: Ticker Fish was Pervases' favorite dish...
Xiao: I just wanted to... see how it tastes.
Paimon: Huh...
Xiao: By wave and storm I hunt for fish, by wind and snow I slay evil...
Xiao: ...
Xiao: Was there anything else? I... am accustomed to eating alone.
Traveler: We'll leave you be, then...
Paimon: Uh huh! And so, Detective Paimon and the trusty Traveler solved the case, and quietly slipped away...
Traveler: Come on, Paimon...
