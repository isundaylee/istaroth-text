Traveler: Feiyun Commerce Guild?
Tu: Exactly! I've heard that they usually deal in silks and satins, but I didn't expect them to also want in on that Chasm Mora as well.
Tu: Also, I never expected Muning to have monetary connections to the Feiyun Commerce Guild. This is a great opportunity!
Tu: So, uh... could you tell me a bit about the details behind their development plans?
