# Talk Dialog

Paimon: Look here! It's a book named "A Guide to Clandestine Contact With the Fatui"... Paimon wonders if we can find clues regarding the Fatui operation stronghold here...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "At night, go near the tents in Apam Woods. Light four torches there..."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Then, go towards the signal lights. The stronghold lies where the lights come from..." Wow, so this is how they've been communicating...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Remember, the code is: Never bring your own rule book to someone else's place..."
Paimon: #They even have a code! Traveler, let's give it a try. "Never bring your own rule book..."
Traveler: "To someone else's place."
Paimon: They say "never bring your own rule book to someone else's place," but hmph! The Fatui brought this contact rule with them to Sumeru...
Paimon: Alright, let's go to Apam Woods and get those Fatui!
