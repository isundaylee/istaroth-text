# Talk Dialog

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Dear guests, remember not to provoke the Koholasaurs, whether young or mature, if you do not have any experience in communicating with them!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Don't be fooled by their calm nature and their preference for being sedentary in the springs. They can be quite the slow starters when it comes to new friends."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Feeding them stimulating foods or trying to get close too early might scare them away, and they might either avoid you in future or politely refuse contact."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "And I'm sure you don't want to be thrown into the sea by one of them after they bop you with their heads, or have one of them grab you and pull you over to Chief Amina's, right? So yes. Take your time, and don't rush it~"
