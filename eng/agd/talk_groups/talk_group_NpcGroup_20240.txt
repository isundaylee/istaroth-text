Chouji: #Is there anything else, Traveler?
Traveler: About the shrines...
Chouji: It's a shame that there aren't many people left on the island. I hope that someone will take care of those shrines...
Chouji: But it's not that bad. No matter how bad things get, it'll all get better in the end, right?
Traveler: Let's hope so.
Chouji: Yup, let's hope so!
