Yanfei: #If it isn't my favorite client, Traveler! It's been a while, how are things?
Yanfei: ...Hmm, by the looks of it, nowhere near dire enough for you to be needing my services. *sigh* A shame, no Mora to be made here...

## Talk

Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Yanfei: Great! Very well! I feel right at home, actually.
Yanfei: Maybe you've forgotten, but this whole Sub-Space Creation thing is nothing new to me.
Traveler: So... you must be able to make your own one of these, right?
Yanfei: Well... it can be a little...
Yanfei: ...I—It's not my forte, okay!?
Yanfei: Anyway, I'm all settled in here now. Making my own would just be redundant.
Yanfei: You should worry about yourself, not me.
Traveler: Then does the mighty and illuminated Yanfei have any suggestions?
Yanfei: One does, as a matter of fact! One thinks you should create a few rooms specifically for housing legal codices.
Yanfei: But this is your home, of course. The rules are yours to decide.

## Talk

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Yanfei: Chat? Oh, I don't know about you, but I can chat, for sure! Good luck trying to get me to stop talking...
Yanfei: You seem like the quiet type, are you sure you won't find me too... animated?
Traveler: I'm sure I'll manage...
Yanfei: Oh... good!
Yanfei: I'm not sure why, but it's nice to hear you say that.
Yanfei: In that case, why don't you choose a topic?
Traveler: Well then... let's chat about difficult clients of yours.
Yanfei: Huh? Of all the interesting topics you could choose, that's what you wanna talk about?
Traveler: Most of the time you successfully win them over.
Yanfei: Oh... I—I see.
Yanfei: Thank you...
Yanfei: Ahem, then I'll start with a client who came to me with a civil case recently...
Traveler: This way, we can figure out any outstanding issues.
Traveler: I'm quite happy just to listen.
Yanfei: Uh... Just to listen?
Yanfei: I don't think one person talking technically qualifies as a chat, per se...
Yanfei: I'm no storyteller after all — I already found my calling in life. I don't plan on spinning yarns for a living any time soon.

## Talk

Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Yanfei: Actually, I was thinking... Do you want to come fishing with me?
Yanfei: Just the two of us, no one else. Not even your little friend here.
Yanfei: Why not? Well, if you must know...
Yanfei: It's no fun fishing by myself. No matter how many I catch, I only ever get to share them with Granny.
Yanfei: Because, as you know, I can't reveal my true power in front of clients or friends.
Yanfei: So whichever way you look at it, it seems you're the only suitable candidate there is.
Traveler: Feels more like I'm a last resort than an ideal candidate...
Yanfei: No, no!
Yanfei: Argh... Okay, okay. I just want to get out and have some fun with you.
Yanfei: Peacefully, without anyone else interrupting. Just the two of us...
Yanfei: You'll have a chance to see what I'm truly capable of, not just professionally...
Traveler: I never doubted you in the first place...
Yanfei: Oh, really...?
Yanfei: Then it's settled! I should warn you though, I have a tendency to view arrangements like these as contracts... No ducking out.
Traveler: But I am pretty good at fishing myself.
Yanfei: Oh ho? Well then, if I wasn't fired up before, I certainly am now!
Traveler: Feels like you're making this up as you go along...

## Talk

Traveler: Morning, Yanfei.
Yanfei: Hey! Morning!
Yanfei: You should show a little more enthusiasm, like me! Hehe!

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Yanfei.
Yanfei: #Night night, Traveler!
Yanfei: I—If you dream of any legal loopholes, I wanna know all the details as soon as you wake up!

## Talk

Yanfei: I didn't know you had such a knack for home décor. This bedroom is quite suitable.
Yanfei: Speaking of the decorations, did you shop around to compare prices? And did you make sure that the artisan fees were at fair market rates?
Yanfei: Take me along next time you go shopping for furniture. I'll help you check all of that so you don't unexpectedly overpay for anything.

## Talk

Yanfei: You wouldn't see any operational mistakes in this commercial area even during a busy festival season.
Yanfei: I can tell that you've put a great deal of time into this.
Yanfei: Do you plan to attract more shops? I can provide you with legal support.
