Traveler: Are you settling in okay?
Gorou: Yeah, you bet! Don't worry, I'm exceedingly good at adapting to new environments.
Gorou: There've been times in the past when I've had to make do with a rock for a pillow, or just find a patch of grass to lie down on. In the army, you learn how to sleep well wherever you are.
Traveler: So do you feel that life here is too relaxed?
Gorou: Haha, why would you think that?
Gorou: If your bowstring is always drawn tight, it will eventually snap.
Gorou: Relaxation is an essential part of improving as a fighter. So as far as I'm concerned, this place is the perfect antidote to the tension of battle!
Gorou: Which brings me to you. I wanted to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude for everything you've done for me. Thank you!
Gorou: You've always been genuine with me, it truly warms my heart.
Gorou: Anyway, don't worry, I'm not here to just take advantage and lounge around. I'm ready to switch to combat mode at a moment's notice!
Traveler: Well, you can finally take it easy here...
Gorou: *sigh*... Seems so.
Gorou: Time of peace is hard to come by. I will cherish every moment of it.
