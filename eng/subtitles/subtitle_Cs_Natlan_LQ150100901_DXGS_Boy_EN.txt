Congratulations, guide from the future
You've completed a challenge that even I found ambitious
And now, I finally have the chance to tell you my story
You may have heard legends describing me
As the best guide in all of Natlan
But in the beginning, I was more like a treasure hunter
I chased results
Facing countless dangers to prove myself
Time after time, I ventured where others didn't dare
Never failing to bring back rare treasures
My fame was second to none
And yet, I never felt satisfied
So I found a new goal...
A challenge that no one had ever achieved before...
The legendary mysterious island. Another chance to prove myself
Unfortunately, my friends, who had traveled with me all this time
Had grown tired of my nonsense
Instead of praise, they now showered me with words of caution
Perhaps... this journey was one that I had to complete alone
But luckily...
They decided to once again put up with my antics
Just as before
They came up with ingenious ways to help me move forward
They never let me down
Even when I had to place my life in their hands
And they always trusted my judgment
Even when it took a lot of courage
In the end, just as ever
We found the "result" we came for
But...
That golden glow was baiting me towards death
It was the glow of a rare ore
But it was also a warning sign of an impending eruption
Maybe if I pressed on, and put my life on the line
I could get the result I wanted
And yet...
There was a chance I'd lose something even more precious
But don't worry
In the end... I made the same choice as you
Everyone was disappointed
That the illustrious guide had, for once, returned empty-handed
But seeing everyone survive
I felt satisfied for the first time in my life
Perhaps the treasure I'd really been searching for
Had been right here with me all along
So, I decided to end my long journey
And find a safe place for my hard-earned treasure
To me, this is the real mysterious island
