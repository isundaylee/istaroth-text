Traveler: Are you settling in to life in Sumeru?
Viktor: No, but I'll just have to learn to get used to it... I was stationed here after all, so complaining won't do me any good.
Viktor: *sigh* I really don't know how Mr. Vsevolod stays so enthusiastic about his work.

Traveler: Do you want to go back to Mondstadt?
Viktor: No, of course not!
Viktor: I may not have gotten acclimated to Sumeru just yet, but I'd much rather be here than in the cathedral getting dirty looks from sisters all the time.
Viktor: Still, I wonder how that kid Lily is doing...

Traveler: See you.
Viktor: You go do what you need to do. I have work I should be getting to as well.
Viktor: *sigh* How did I end up getting stationed here...

Traveler: Why don't I bring her a letter for you?
Viktor: You'd do that? Uh...
Viktor: Forget it, it's fine. Really.
Viktor: I'm a Fatuus, I shouldn't be sending letters to that child. Who knows what sort of trouble that could stir up...

## Talk 5

Viktor: We meet again, Traveler. If you have the time, do you mind doing me a favor? The remuneration will not disappoint.
Traveler: How are you lot still in Mondstadt?
Viktor: Oh? I don't recall doing anything that might warrant overstaying my welcome.
Viktor: Ah, you mean those fellows living it up at the Goth Grand Hotel? I don't know anything about that, I'm afraid. Not my jurisdiction.
Viktor: Well, whatever. Let's cut to the chase. You Mondstadt folk do so love to natter on and drag your feet.
Viktor: Do you remember our previous deal? You help me, and I let you in on some things you'd like to hear.
Viktor: Same deal this time. You set me up with some of Mondstadt's local specialties, and I'll spin you a little yarn. How does that sound?
Traveler: What sort of yarn?
Viktor: Haha, well, get me the goods, and you'll get your story... You won't lose out.
Viktor: Worry not, we Fatui always deliver.
Viktor: Alright, alright. Just do it for me, and quickly. I'll be waiting for you inside the Cathedral.
Viktor: *sigh* Really now, what a way to make a heist out of a milk run...
Traveler: What do you need those specialties for, anyway?
Viktor: Can you not be so... so... wary? I came all this way to Mondstadt. I can't just leave without buying anything, now can I?
Viktor: In any case, it seems like the locals are getting more and more hostile towards us Fatui. I fear we'll have to return to Snezhnaya at any moment.
Viktor: So, I don't see the issue with stocking up a little and bringing it all back when the time comes.
Viktor: I'm not familiar with Mondstadt, and I don't know what specialties to get. You, on the other hand, have been around these parts for far longer.
Viktor: That's why I've come to ask you for help. I'm just buying some things, not plotting to commit some crime...
Traveler: So what do you want?
Viktor: I say, what's the big idea here? I've never done anything to you. I recall that our previous transaction was quite amiable.

## Talk 6

Viktor: What are you playing at? What do you want?

### Talk 6 related talk 0

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Viktor: Hehe, now that's a topic that piques my interest. I am quite curious to see how the Knights of Favonius will handle Stormterror.
Viktor: And if I may add, we the Fatui had nothing to do with this disaster.
Viktor: So please refrain from pointing fingers and tarnishing the Fatui's reputation when this all goes down!

Traveler: What are you doing?
Viktor: Hmph! I am not idling away my time by napping!
Viktor: I'll have you know I am a Fatui diplomat—
Viktor: Diplomat's assistant, Viktor!
Viktor: I am here on orders from his excellency to assess the situation in Mondstadt!
Traveler: That sounds exciting, tell me more.
Viktor: I'll tell you one thing... Mondstadt is boring! *yawn*
Viktor: Though they call it the City of Freedom...
Viktor: There's just nothing to do here at all. How do Mondstadters put up with this place?
Viktor: Also, what's the big deal with this Barbatos guy? He's never even here!
Viktor: Can't compare with Her Majesty, the Tsaritsa of the Zapolyarny Palace... Ugh, never mind, that sister over there is giving me evil looks again.

### Talk 6 related talk 2

Traveler: Tell me about the Fatui.
Viktor: You Mondstadt folk could not begin to fathom the affairs of the Fatui.
Viktor: Ahem... Though to be honest, even I don't know about what goes on at the top level.
Viktor: In any case, all you need to know is that there is no greater honor than being under the protection of the Fatui.
Viktor: And as for the archons... Well, compared to having a Delusion at hand, all those religious beliefs and Visions and so on are just child's play.

Viktor: So soon? Bye then.
Viktor: You Mondstadters are no fun to be around anyway...
