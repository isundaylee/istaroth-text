Francis: What are you eating?
Francis: Only the best food that Liyue has to offer â€” Yue cuisine!
Francis: The Fullmoon Egg, for example: fish, shrimp, green peppers and eggs all blended perfectly into one dish...
Francis: There's also the Crystal Shrimp: its outer skin glistening and transparent like a jewel, to the point where you can see the whole shrimp within...
Francis: That fresh, tender mouthfeel... Ah, it's almost as if the food was still alive in my mouth. It's just wonderful!
