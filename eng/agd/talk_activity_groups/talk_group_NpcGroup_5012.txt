Traveler: Is there anything of note nearby?

## Talk

Remande: Not that I remember... Certainly not anything worth taking pictures of.

Remande: Once we're done preparing the film, we can continue taking boat-tos!

## Talk

Traveler: Boat-tos?
Remande: Boat-tos! Photos of boats. Boats, photos — by which I mean pictures of the aquabuses.
Remande: I absolutely adore the aquabus network — really, I'd take a picture of every last detail if I could.
Remande: My dream is to someday recreate a scale clockwork model of an aquabus without needing to refer to the real object, or even pictures of it.
Remande: At this moment, I've reached the phase where I'm taking photos daily, and familiarizing myself with them. Wish me well, friend!

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Remande: See you — be sure to take a trip onboard yourself!

## Talk

Traveler: Sounds impressive.
Remande: Of course it does! If you are interested as well, you are welcome to join us aquabus enthusiasts.
Remande: However, I have a few reminders for newcomers.
Remande: While admiring the aquabuses, do not behave in any way that might interfere with the normal functioning of aquabus facilities or disturb the tour guides on the aquabuses.
