Traveler: About the golden designs...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr...
Paimon: Hmmm... The golden designs you speak of are probably those "Iridescent Inscriptions"...
Paimon: Though sometimes, Paimon can't see them where you say they are...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Grrooooah? Wrrrooo...?
Paimon: No need for you to start "wrooing", it's better not to see some things...
Paimon: #{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} and {NICKNAME}, you two be careful, okay?
