# Vanquishing Phantoms


## Talk 1

Clorinde (Game Master): Finally, you arrive at the chu{RUBY#[D]Basement}rch Florian described.
Clorinde (Game Master): As you approach, an ominous aura surrounds you. You get the sense that your enemy is close at hand.
Furina: (How strange... This uneasy feeling seems so real. How did they manage that?)
Clorinde (Game Master): Now... it is time for the final battle.
Lyney: Let's go.
Clorinde: Florian, wait.
Florian: What's wrong?
Clorinde: I think you should wait outside. You've already been corrupted by the Devorator once. It could easily re-enter your mind and take control of your body.
Clorinde: I don't think it's a good idea for you to be this close. If it corrupts you again, it's possible you might take on a new form entirely.
Florian: That's exactly why I have to go... why I should be at the very front.
Clorinde: ...! You mean...
Florian: Yes, I intend to lure it into my body.
Clorinde: That's too risky. If things get out of hand, I might have to kill you. Do you understand how dangerous this is?
Florian: I understand. But if I do this, you'll have a clear and visible target.
Florian: The Devorator will have a hard time passing up the chance to enter a body it knows how to control. You won't have to worry about any of your friends being taken over.
Clorinde: ...
Florian: You're not like me, Miss Clorinde. You're a just and powerful Marechaussee Hunter. This monster broke free due to my error. It's only right that I shoulder the responsibility for its destruction.
Florian: This is... something that I have to do.
Florian: Consider it a duel to restore my honor. My only request is that you give it your all.
Clorinde: ...I understand.
Clorinde: Then, as a Champion Duelist, I hereby accept your request for a duel, and extend to you my most sincere regards.
Florian: ...Thank you.
Clorinde: The battle is now upon us. Let the Devorator once again tremble under the blade of the Marechaussee Hunters.

## Talk 2

Clorinde (Game Master): And so, the monsters were eradicated, and the sorcerer was defeated.
Clorinde (Game Master): Peace soon returned to the capital. Those in the court manipulated by the sorcerer also recognized the errors of their ways...
Clorinde (Game Master): Some remembered the names of the heroes who saved their kingdom, but others simply continued their lives none the wiser.
Clorinde (Game Master): Such is the story of the Marechaussee Hunters. They pursue the phantoms in the darkness and exterminate all who pose a threat...
Clorinde (Game Master): They will always protect the city and those within it, even should all memory of their accomplishments be forgotten by the very people they serve.
Furina: Whew... I'm assuming we've finally reached the end of the script?
Clorinde: Yes. You've reached one of the better endings.
Furina: It's a pretty solid story overall. I thought it was just an ordinary adventure at first, but the further we got into it, the more impressed I became with the production and the plot.
Furina: That final battle especially! All the effects were super realistic.
Navia: Right, yeah, hehe... totally.
Lyney: Ah... That's a really good point. I never expected the weapons we picked up from that vault would have that kind of effect.
Furina: Yeah, mine nearly scared the daylights out of me when it started glowing! I took a good look at it after we got out, but I don't think it ever lit up again.
Furina: Oh, we should probably give these props back, right? I'll just leave mine here.
Clorinde: Did you have a good time?
Furina: Of course. Let me know if another script like this comes around!
Clorinde: Sure, no problem.
Furina: Then, I'll head back for now. I think I need some time to fully digest everything that just happened.
Furina: Once Mr. Florian is awake, please pass on my regards to him. He must be extremely exhausted, to have passed out cold like that.
Clorinde: You're right. He's had a lot to deal with.
Furina: Well, see you all some other time! Toodle-oo!
Navia: ...Okay, so, can I ask now?
Lyney: I think it should be fine, yeah.
Navia: What in the world was going on back there?
Clorinde: ...Ah, so you saw through all of that?
Lyney: Ahahaha... That time in the cave when you told us to close our eyes... It'd be weirder if we didn't notice anything.
Navia: I was dying of curiosity the entire time! I mean, you did a pretty bang-up job of pretending nothing had gone wrong. Furina actually looked like she thought all of it was planned...
Lyney: Guess none of us wanted to be the one to break the illusion.
Paimon: Huh? What are you all talking about?
Traveler: Yeah, what's going on?
Navia: Wait, don't tell me you never...! Ah, this is all my fault. It's not too late to cover your ears! Here, partner, I'll do it for you!
Lyney: Um... Bit late for that, don't you think?
Paimon: Uh... You're saying... Everything that happened back there wasn't actually part of the script?
Clorinde: It's probably more accurate to say this was never a real scripted story to begin with.
Paimon: Whaaat!?
Florian: ...So loud... My head...
Paimon: Hey, you! Get up right now and explain yourself!
Florian: Ahhhhh! No shaking, please! My head...!
Black Screen Text: Florian explains the truth to everyone...
Paimon: D—Did Paimon just hear that right? You guys made up that whole last part on the spot?
Paimon: It's not nice to lie to people, but.... Paimon's gotta admit, that was a really good story, Florian. Oh, and nice improvisation, Clorinde!
Lyney: Yeah! It was like watching a magician improvise a spectacular magic trick after forgetting an important prop.
Paimon: If Paimon knew something was wrong with that vault, she would've floated straight in the opposite direction!
Clorinde: Everything was under control.
Navia: As if you've ever described a situation as being "out of control." I'm pretty sure any situation you consider to be easy to handle would scare a reasonable person half to death!
Clorinde: Guess I'm just used to it.
Paimon: Uh... You must run into a lot of unexpected situations, then... That explains why you're so good at coming up with things on the spot...
Clorinde: As for you, Florian...
Florian: ...I know there's no excuse for what I did. I'll turn myself in to the Gardes at once, confess my crimes, and accept any punishment that comes my way.
Clorinde: I would say you've already suffered more than enough.
Florian: ...What?
Clorinde: You may have been blinded by fame and fortune in the beginning, but your actions during the final battle had proven you to be a true Marechaussee Hunter.
Florian: ...
Clorinde: You'll be far more use to the city above ground than below. Your job as a Hunter is more important.
Florian: But...
Clorinde: Of course, you'll still need to take the keys and pay a personal visit to the two Hunters you wronged. Prepare to accept any terms they give you as well.
Florian: ...Yes, of course.
Clorinde: As far as I'm concerned, though... Your showing in the duel was enough to prove your honor.
Florian: ...! Then, I'll do exactly as you said. I... I'll go return those two keys right now.
Florian: Thank you so much, everyone. I'll do my best to prove myself worthy of the second chance you've given me. I swear this on my name and honor as a Marechaussee Hunter.
Florian: Until we meet again, everyone.
Traveler: I was just playing along too...
Navia: Wait, don't tell me Paimon never...! Ah, this is all my fault. It's not too late to cover your ears! Here, Paimon, I'll do it for you!

## Talk 3

Lyney: Speaking of Marechaussee Hunters... What should we do about the "treasure" in that cave?
Clorinde: Leave it be.
Paimon: Are you sure? We could show it to people, make it so that the Hunters are remembered... Don't you want that?
Clorinde: No. Every name on that tablet made the same choice. All Hunters know what the path entails.
Clorinde: I am no exception... My identity as a Marechaussee Hunter is not something I need people to remember. I wish only to be recognized as a Champion Duelist, nothing more.
Lyney: That's certainly very different from the path of a magician. Still, I admire your decision.
Paimon: Wait, Paimon just remembered something. If there were no special effects involved, why did our weapons begin to glow during the battle?
Clorinde: That's because the Marechaussee Hunters of ages past would often imbue their weapons with special enchantments to suppress the monsters. Whenever a monster was nearby, their weapons would start to glow.
Navia: Ooh! So that's why they had an effect on that guy near the end. I really thought the summons were doing all the work.
Clorinde: Well, I'm sure the summons were a part of it, too.
Lyney: Oh? How so?
Clorinde: This particular Devorator probably hailed from the same era as the Hunters we saw in the room.
Clorinde: The names you recited all belonged to the bravest Hunters. Countless monsters fell to their blades. That's likely why the Devorator visibly reacted when you said them out loud.
Paimon: So the names held the power all along...
Clorinde: ...
Clorinde: Navia, everything you said during your "summon"...
Navia: Huh? Ah—hahaha! I um, I meant what I said. I mean, it was true to my character! So, yeah, I'm glad you heard it, just don't make me repeat myself. It's embarrassing!
Clorinde: I really appreciated those words.
Navia: Alright, alright. Don't get all sentimental on me.
Navia: Uhh... Anyway, let's not talk about that anymore! I'm going to go on ahead. Don't fall too far behind, now!
Paimon: Ah... She ran off.
Lyney: I should probably head back as well. This story was truly incredible. I might have to spend the whole night telling my siblings all about it!
Traveler: See you later.
Lyney: Mhm, Goodbye!
Clorinde: ...
Clorinde: #Traveler... Should your name and deeds be forgotten, what do you think the significance of your journey will be?
Traveler: (...)
Traveler: I suppose the significance would be the journey itself and the world we helped create. There's still value in the time I shared with everyone here, in the things we were able to accomplish, even if no one remembers them.
Clorinde: A great answer. I'll remember it.
Traveler: What would your answer be, Clorinde?
Clorinde: Me? Hah...
Clorinde: "The Marechaussee Hunter says nothing in response to that question."
Clorinde: "Perhaps her answer lies in her silence, an unspoken vow left to echo through the night. The path she walks needs no explanation."
