Traveler: Work meal?
Quezhi: Oh, forgive me. According to Ms. Vert Jr.'s suggestion, a more elegant name for it would be... a simple meal.
Quezhi: Indeed! It's a simple meal for those coming and going on business!
Quezhi: Of course, we serve regular lunch and dinner as well. However, we usually don't serve them in our outdoor dining area.
Quezhi: These tables are usually reserved for guests to sip tea while listening to performances and stories.
Quezhi: Our teahouse's indoor dining area, private seats, and private rooms are temporarily under renovation. Please do give us a visit once those renovations are completed!
