Kinich (Ajaw): Waiting for the monsters to die of old age, Kinich? Or did they pound that thick skull of yours into the ground enough that even you decided to just find a cozy little corner to play dead in?

Kinich: I gather information first by force of habit. But this Domain is constantly shifting, making it difficult to get a holistic view. We should be careful as we progress.
Kinich (Ajaw): Ohohoho, lost your nerve, have you, Kinich? And here I thought you were an adrenaline junkie!
Kinich (Ajaw): The Almighty Dragonlord, K'uhul Ajaw perceives that ahead lies an extremely extreme "challenge" with your name on it! Surely you wouldn't want such a fantastic opportunity to slip through your fingers and into the grasp of another? Hehehehe...
