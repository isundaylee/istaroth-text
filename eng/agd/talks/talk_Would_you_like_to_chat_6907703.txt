# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to chat?
Yaoyao: Sure. I love chatting!
Yaoyao: It's always fun, no matter who I'm talking to!
Traveler: No matter who, you say? Such as?
Yaoyao: Well, such as... cranes!
Yaoyao: I encountered a very beautiful crane once while washing radishes by a brook.
Yaoyao: It had many colorful feathers, it was so pretty to look at.
Yaoyao: I called out to it, and to my surprise, the crane could speak!
Traveler: Was that Mountain Shaper?
Yaoyao: Hehe, well, let me give you some hints...
Yaoyao: We really hit it off, and then we shared the shredded radish salad that I made... She also told me a lot of interesting stories.
Yaoyao: Eventually, she declared that we had been fated to meet, and gave me Yuegui.
Yaoyao: She made it using her very own mechanical arts, you know!
Traveler: Oh, so was that Cloud Retainer?
Yaoyao: Bingo! Congratulations, you guessed it!
Yaoyao: Adeptus arts, mechanics... I'm really amazed by her many powerful and practical skills.
Yaoyao: Let's go talk to her together sometime, shall we?
Traveler: Was that Cloud Retainer, by any chance?
Yaoyao: Whoa, you got that without any hints! How did you guess?
Yaoyao: I guess the term "smart cookie" was made just for you, huh? Nice one.
Yaoyao: Aunty Cloud Retainer and I had a great time chatting, and then we ate the shredded radish salad that I made... She also told me a lot of interesting stories.
Yaoyao: Eventually, she declared that we had been fated to meet, and gave me Yuegui.
Yaoyao: She made it using her very own mechanical arts, you know!
