## Talk

Acat: Welcome. Given that most people are unable to describe the exact color they want, I suggest you bring some reference material with you.

## Talk

Traveler: Color, you say?
Acat: Of course. You're not in the wrong place, are you? We sell paints in this shop, not colorful drinks.
Acat: If you bring me a sample, I can mix you a paint of the exact same color.
Acat: Or to err on the side of caution, perhaps I should say... I can mix a color that's ninety-nine percent the same.

## Talk

Traveler: I'll do so if needed in the future.
Acat: Oh, no problem.

## Talk

Traveler: Very interesting. What's your trick?
Acat: Of course, it's down to talent.
Acat: Just like how some people won't get lost even when they're in a totally new place, I'm a natural when it comes to color.
Acat: As I see it, there's no such thing as ugly colors, just ugly combinations. Even the hue of rotten fruit will shine in the right context.
Acat: Speaking of which, your eyes are a lovely color... In fact, I'm going to try mixing it later.
