# Talk Dialog

Traveler: (What is this place...?)
Yumemizuki Mizuki: #Traveler, come over here...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Longing, caused by separation... It tastes so bitter. Please, don't stop moving.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Despair, caused by failure... Icy-cold on the lips. Please, keep going.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Regret, caused by missed opportunity... A sharp aftertaste. Please, don't look back.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Go to where the sakura petals fall, go to where the squirrels play, go to where you can hear the sound of the waves...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: That is where I am.
