# Dragon Storm


## Talk 1

Amber: Stormterror... is attacking Mondstadt itself!
Amber: #Kaeya, {NICKNAME}, you've come at the right time. We must...
Kaeya: Hold on, Amber. Are you perhaps forgetting to introduce us?
Amber: Oh... right. This is Kaeya, our Cavalry Captain.
Amber: #These two are travelers from afar, {NICKNAME} and Paimon.
Kaeya: (From afar? Is that all we know of them?)
Amber: Long story short...
Kaeya: I see. Welcome to Mondstadt â€” though you haven't arrived at the best of times, I'm afraid.
Kaeya: I understand the anguish of being separated from family.
Kaeya: I'm not really sure why you're looking for the Anemo God...
Kaeya: But everyone has their secrets, right?
Kaeya: Haha, relax! I won't press you for more.
Kaeya: First and foremost, on behalf of the Knights of Favonius, I would like to extend our thanks to you for your help just now.
Traveler: Well, we couldn't just leave the situation to fester.
Kaeya: Your fight to defend the city against the dragon just now was witnessed by no small number of citizens.
Kaeya: The Acting Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius is also very interested in meeting you, and formally invites you both to <color=#00E1FFFF>our headquarters</color>.
Traveler: You're welcome! So... Ah... Where's the reward?
Kaeya: Ahh... How about a traditional Mondstadt delicacy, Sticky Honey Roast?
Traveler: I just heard about that one!

## Talk 2

Paimon: This is the <color=#00E1FFFF>Knights of Favonius Headquarters</color>. Let's take a look inside.
