Kirara: #Traveler! The weather's great today!
Kirara: Hmm... although now I think about it... the weather here is the same every day.

## Talk

Traveler: Do you like it here?
Kirara: Oh, is this like a user feedback form? Ahem, time to get serious then.
Kirara: First, five stars for the environment! The view here is beyond breathtaking, I'm talking a once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience, and on top of that, there is definitely some kind of youkai power here that I can't put my finger on just yet.
Kirara: Second, five stars for comfort! I've been getting some great nights' sleep in my box.
Kirara: There's been no noise, no bright lights, no nothing! I couldn't have asked for anything more!
Kirara: And finally... another five stars for service! There's really nothing for me to nitpick in this category.
Traveler: Such a high rating... Thank you.
Kirara: You deserve all the praise! I'm the one that should be thanking you.
Traveler: Anything else you'd like to add?
Kirara: Huh? Did I miss one? ...Oh wait, I get it — this is the open-ended question where I can mention anything that hasn't already been covered.
Kirara: Alright, let me think...
Kirara: I've taken quite an interest in that huge Emerald Finch. She looks chubby and fluffy, and seems to be going through life without a care in the world...
Traveler: That's Tubby, a teapot spirit.
Kirara: A teapot spirit? You mean like a Tsukumogami? Are you saying her original form is an actual teapot?
Kirara: Or are you saying this is in fact her original form, but she can turn into a human girl just like me?
Kirara: Ahh! This is so exciting! You have to introduce me to her!
Traveler: You are NOT allowed to eat her.
Kirara: Oh, of course not, I would never do that!
Kirara: A little curiosity never hurt anyone, right? I just want to know where she comes from, what she does or thinks about, who knows, we may just end up becoming friends!
Kirara: If you get a chance, please introduce me to her!
Traveler: You answered everything so seriously...
Kirara: You've done so much work around here, it's the least I can do to tell you exactly how I feel.

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Kirara: Sure! Is there anything you'd like to ask me?
Traveler: Can you tell me more about your job as a courier?
Kirara: You couldn't have chosen a better topic!
Kirara: Delivering a high volume of packages isn't a problem for me, youkai's legs are naturally fast after all.
Kirara: But maintaining a good rating with clients isn't nearly as easy. Most people don't even bother to leave a review, good or bad... I guess it's human nature to avoid doing anything that isn't absolutely necessary?
Kirara: Yet, despite that... I've noticed that when I'm a cat, passers-by always stop and stare at me like they have nothing better to do, even if I'm just sunbathing. But as soon as I turn into a human being, suddenly no one has two minutes to spare to leave a good rating. Weird, isn't it?
Traveler: Do you ever get tired from working?
Kirara: Hmm... depends. Sometimes, I guess — especially leading up to festivals, when the express packages start piling up like a bunch of Zaytun Peaches about to burst...
Kirara: If only my youkai powers were stronger... maybe then I'd be able to run even faster. Hehe, or maybe even split myself into a ton of different clones!
Traveler: So one nekomata with two tails...
Kirara: Argh, stop with the math! I'm gonna tie my tails in knots trying to keep up!
Traveler: You sound really passionate about your work.
Kirara: Why wouldn't I be? After all, this job has allowed me to visit and find my place in all kinds of human cities!
Kirara: You could say that taking my job seriously is my way to show my gratitude!
Traveler: Would become three nekomata with six tails...
Traveler: How's the work going?
Kirara: Hehe, you're looking at the only gold level courier of Komaniya Express!
Kirara: My boss even wanted to give me a special bonus! I told them though that I'd still prefer more paid-for international vacations, uh, I mean, opportunities to deliver international packages.

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Kirara: Yes! There's something I've been meaning to ask you for a while.
Kirara: #Do you know what styles human girls are into these days?
Traveler: Um...
Kirara: Too sudden? My bad, my bad! Alright then, allow me to explain the situation from the beginning.
Kirara: As you're already aware, even though I am a youkai, I've been looked after by my human Granny since a very early age.
Kirara: It goes without saying that I've heard way more stories about humans than I did about the youkai. I've always looked forward to joining the colorful and warm world that is human society!
Kirara: But even after I managed to use my youkai powers to give myself a human form, I still didn't know how to fit in. It would be a bit awkward for me to still dress and act like a nekomata when I'd already changed my look...
Kirara: I began to observe human girls to see what they liked to wear. It seemed to me that everyone really liked bows and flowers...
Kirara: And so, I added a ton on my own clothes!
Traveler: They look really cute on you!
Kirara: You really think so? Aw, thanks! *purr*
Kirara: So um... would you be willing to accompany me to go on a little shopping spree whenever you're free?
Kirara: I'd love to buy some cute accessories, and with an expert like you by my side, nothing can go wrong!
Traveler: You could add a few more accessories to match with your outfit.
Kirara: Whoa! A fashion connoisseur? I knew I came to the right person!

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Kirara.
Kirara: #Morning, Traveler! How do I look? 'Cause I feel pretty good!
Kirara: Oh, but don't worry — just because I'm feeling perky doesn't mean I'm gonna hunt any of your finches! Promise!

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Kirara.
Kirara: Nighty night! There's just one last thing — and I'm not saying you will, but if you do end up hearing some crunching noises in your dreams... just know that it's perfectly normal.
Kirara: Ugh, fine, I—I'll try my best not to eat anything in the middle of the night.

## Talk

Kirara: I love these kinds of streets! They're always super lively and beautiful.
Kirara: I especially love climbing onto the roof and looking down at the crowd going about their day. It's incredibly fascinating to me!
Kirara: Actually, while you're here, why don't you also give it a try?

## Talk

Kirara: These two trees look insanely sturdy! The foliage is also surprisingly dense.
Kirara: Just imagine... how cozy would it be if we could climb up there and take a nap?
Kirara: The subtle breeze blowing on the leaves, coupled with the sound of water coming from the fountain... Ah— I swear, I'm feeling sleepy already...
