## Talk 1

Bulletin Board: As an entrance to Sumeru, Caravan Ribat is a critical pass. This Bulletin Board is established to inform merchants and tourists of important matters. Please heed the notices on the board often.

## Talk 2

Bulletin Board: "My love, though you are so far away from me, my heart belongs to you as always."
Bulletin Board: "I know. You have more important things to attend to. After all, the higher position you are in, the more responsibilities you shoulder."
Bulletin Board: "But I couldn't share with anyone the thing that is troubling me so deeply. I couldn't tell them your name."
Bulletin Board: "I hope one day I'll be able to let everyone know how learned and wise you are."

## Talk 3

Bulletin Board: To the Great Red Sand.
Bulletin Board: Those who do not revere the deceased shall stay here.

## Talk 4

Bulletin Board: The Akademiya strictly forbids destruction in any form of the Wall of Samiel.
Bulletin Board: Any violation will be severely punished.

## Talk 5

Bulletin Board: "Preserved fruit, dessert ingredients and other desert specialties on sale."
Bulletin Board: "Delivery is available for large-quantity orders."
Bulletin Board: "This looks good. I could make Dango with it. Can you deliver it to Inazuma?"
Bulletin Board: "My apologies. Cross-border delivery is only available to Liyue."

## Talk 6

Bulletin Board: Although it seems there's no need for Gilded Journey to advertise as it's the only hotel in Caravan Ribat.
Bulletin Board: Our barbecue is savory with the authentic tinge from the desert. Way more authentic than in the city.
Bulletin Board: Exhausted travelers, be sure to come for a taste.

## Talk 7

Bulletin Board: "I hope the Mahamata considers tightening customs restrictions at Caravan Ribat."
Bulletin Board: "Now any desert folk can pass through the border, giving bandits the chance to flee into the jungle for a hide and taking jobs away from people in Sumeru."
Bulletin Board: "The Akasha has not been available to the desert folk, but commissions issued by Citadel of Regzar cover way more than mercenaries. If it goes on like this, even all sit in for the entrance exam for the Akademiya, some will lose their jobs anyway."
Bulletin Board: "What are you talking about? The desert folk are the people of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, and they are people of Sumeru as well. It is only natural that they are allowed to enter the city."
Bulletin Board: "Be careful when you say this here."

## Talk 8

Bulletin Board: Researchers who stay in Caravan Ribat for a long time must register with the Mahamata before checking in at the hotel to avoid knowledge leakage and other unexpected happenings.

## Talk 9

Bulletin Board: Merchants and travelers must register with the Mahamata for approval to cross the border.

## Talk 10

## Talk 11

Bulletin Board: "I heard the Akademiya had set up a hospital in the desert for Eleazar. But it was abandoned for some reasons unknown..."
Bulletin Board: "According to residents of Aaru Village, there were cured Eleazar patients who'd escaped from there."
Bulletin Board: "If there's information left there, it might lead to a cure for the disease..."

## Talk 12

Bulletin Board: "They say one of us from Aaru Village has become a high official at the Akademiya. We desert folk might well live a better life in the future."
Bulletin Board: "I barely earn enough carrying these stones. But with a single order of carrying something like cans of knowledge, I could afford to get married back at my hometown."
Bulletin Board: "But I heard that that official happens to be one who tackles smuggling. I don't think that person will be on our side."
Bulletin Board: "Tsk, that's how we desert folk end up like this. We don't unite."

## Talk 13

Bulletin Board: Adventurers going to the desert, please note that all adventures to the Great Red Sand must be registered at the Akademiya.
Bulletin Board: Relics found in the desert belong to Akademiya in principle, and no one shall take possession of them.
Bulletin Board: Due to security concerns, a ban on access to desert areas excluding the Sea of the Great Red Sand has been issued by the Akademiya.
Bulletin Board: Akademiya assumes no responsibility for any accidents in the areas.

## Talk 14

Bulletin Board: "They say some people earned a fortune just by selling sand pupa grease in the city. Now they have mansions there and claim themselves to be some kind of family. Even pretending to be cronies with those at the Akademiya."
Bulletin Board: "I've spent most of my life carrying stones here, and I still have nothing."
Bulletin Board: "What do you know? Sand pupa grease is a business licensed by the Akademiya. You can't even have a finger in the pie."
Bulletin Board: "If you wanna make a fortune, come smuggle books with me. If it works out, at least we won't need to carry stones here anymore."

## Talk 15

Bulletin Board: "Young people overthink everything these days. Hadn't it been for Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, we Aaru villagers would have long been skeletons under the ruins of those temples."
Bulletin Board: "I overheard someone say that King Deshret might come back to life. Even that Greater Lord Rukkhadevata never came back after all these years, let alone King Deshret."
Bulletin Board: "Better get to our work now. We can't afford to live with the few supplies delivered to Aaru Village every month."

## Talk 16

Bulletin Board: Permanent recruitment of workers for Wall of Samiel maintenance.
Bulletin Board: We offer a fair salary with free meals and accommodation.
Bulletin Board: Outstanding employees will be recommended by the official to receive further education at the Akademiya.

## Talk 17

Bulletin Board: "I have forgiven your sins in the name of the King of the Magic Bottle, yet who shall forgive ours?"

## Talk 18

Bulletin Board: "I hope the Mahamata considers tightening customs restrictions at Caravan Ribat."
Bulletin Board: "Now any desert folk can pass through the border, giving bandits the chance to flee into the jungle for a hide and taking jobs away from people in Sumeru."
Bulletin Board: "The Akasha has not been available to the desert folk, but commissions issued by the Citadel of Regzar cover way more than mercenaries. If it goes on like this, even if all sit in for the entrance exam for the Akademiya, some will lose their jobs anyway."
Bulletin Board: "What are you talking about? The desert folk are the people of the Dendro Archon, and they are people of Sumeru as well. It is only natural that they are allowed to enter the city."
Bulletin Board: "Be careful what you say here."
