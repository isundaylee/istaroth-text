Traveler: What do you have to deal with?
Nizam: For example, when it comes to the birthday of the Dendro Archon, residents nearby would come to the Akademiya to apply for funds to hold the Sabzeruz Festival.
Nizam: Ever since Lesser Lord Kusanali reasserted control over the Akademiya, everyone's been even more fired up about this festival... and the number of requests has also shot up, as you might expect.
Nizam: I mean, I complain about it, but I'm still going to my job as usual.
