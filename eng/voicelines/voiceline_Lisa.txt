# Lisa Voicelines

## Hello
Hi darling, are you going to be Lisa's little helper? What? Me, a grand mage? That was a long time ago, I'm just a humble librarian now. *chuckles* Don't worry darling, I'll take very good care of you. So...

## Chat: Afternoon Tea
It's nearly time for afternoon tea.

## Chat: Quest
Why not keep me company for a while... There'll be plenty of time for work later.

## Chat: Better to Stay In
Today's no good for going out... Hmm... Did I say that yesterday as well?

## When It Rains
*sigh* Perfect weather for sipping a cup of tea while gazing out the window.

## When Thunder Strikes
When I practice my spells in weather like this, I can do half the work for double the impact. Haha, I'm just teasing.

## When It's Windy
Such a calming breeze... Perfect for taking a nap, don't you think?

## Good Morning
*yawn* Good morning, Jean... Oh, it's you! Sorry, dear.

## Good Afternoon
It must almost be time for a nap...

## Good Evening
You're still up? I'm getting sleepy...

## Good Night
I can see how hard you've been working today. Let me think of a way to reward you...

## About Lisa
I'm not lazy, I just know to save my energy for when I need it most.

## About Us: Relationships
I can be your teacher, your master, or your friend... or all three if you want...

## About Us: Capabilities
Let me show you a thing or two, lest we let your efforts go to waste. *chuckles*

## About Us: Ceremony
Wait, one last thing... A kiss on the forehead from master to follower. Now you're my star pupil.

## About the Vision
Visions? Ah, they're a necessary device in controlling the elements — with you being the sole exception, of course. Hmm... As for why that is, perhaps... we can find the time to experiment a little?

## Something to Share
Feel free to use the alchemist's upstairs from the library whenever you want. But make sure you knock first... we wouldn't want you seeing anything you're not supposed to, now would we?

## Interesting Things
Calla Lilies are a medicinal flower with antidotal properties. With them in hand, there's no need to worry about the side effects of any potions... Hehe.

## About Jean
Jean is a gifted and dedicated leader. Seeing how hard she works makes even me want to help her out.

## About Amber
Amber was just a young girl when she joined the knights, and in the blink of an eye, she's turned into such a strong young lady. I'm curious to see what she'll be like a few years from now.

## About Barbara
Have you heard Barbara sing before? Her angelic voice contains a magical healing energy. A different kind of magical energy from the one in my potions, of course. I wonder which one you prefer?

## About Diluc
You want to know about Diluc? Haha, in that case, I know someone else you should talk to.

## About Razor
Come on Razor, that's it, good boy! Let's do some combat practice — I've found you the perfect partner. Hey! Come back!

## About Klee
Last time little Klee wanted to use my workshop for her experiments, I had to say no, and she was angry at me for the rest of the day. *sigh* What happened the next day, you ask? She went off happily to play outside of course.

## About Mona
As for Mona? She seems to be an excellent mage, but I'm not a part of their Hexenzirkel. The idea of Irminsul exploration and formal tea parties just leaves me cold.

## About Albedo
Albedo is quite the alchemist. Just say the word and he'll come up with a good solution. He's easy on the eyes too, just like you.

## About Fischl
Fischl, yes, she's always in the library looking to borrow fantasy novels. She always returns her books three days early and looks after them very well. She's a good kid.

## About Noelle
Every time I ask Noelle to dust off the bookshelves, I'm always left with the sense that the more exhausted I make her, the happier she becomes. Yes, who knows what's going on with her... *chuckles*

## About Sucrose
Try not to bother Sucrose if you're at a loose end, you'll only startle the poor girl. She's gifted at interacting with all sorts of exotic creatures — just hopeless when it comes to humans.

## About Cyno
I've barely kept in touch with anyone from the Akademiya since leaving Sumeru, except for the occasional letters to my teachers out of basic courtesy. Fortunately, not every promising student turned out as lazy as I am... I heard that one of my juniors, Cyno, now leads quite the action-packed life.

## About Collei
Ah, dear little Collei. Every time she writes to me, she tries out new words and expressions she's learned recently... Hehe, no wonder she's improving so quickly. That wonderful and warmhearted master of hers must have helped a lot too.

## About Mika
I do rather envy Huffman for having such a caring little brother. Mika takes care of everything around the house and even looks after him when he's drunk... Ah, how nice it must be to lounge around all day without a care in the world... Hmm? What do you mean, I already do that? You're getting quite bold these days, aren't you, cutie?

## More About Lisa: I
So, which element would you like to learn about today?

## More About Lisa: II
My past? So, you want to get to know me a little better, huh? *chuckles* That's a story for another day. But I'm touched that you asked.

## More About Lisa: III
When I taught Razor how to utilize Elemental Energy, I never expected him to master the technique so quickly. Come to think of it, you're talented too. Maybe I could teach you a few tricks...

## More About Lisa: IV
What's that? You want to learn some Sumeru Akademiya magic? I'm afraid it might be a bit too much for you to handle right now... Hmm, though I suppose it can't hurt to teach you some of the basics. Here, start by reading the beginner's guide, it's only 800 pages or so.

## More About Lisa: V
A Vision may seem like a great tool, but one day, the power one accumulates always finds a way to turn back on you. Should such a day come for me, so long as you're around... Ah, never mind.

## Lisa's Hobbies
Hey darling, would you like to try one of my magic potions? There's no knowing what it will do to you until you try it, though... Don't say I didn't warn you!

## Lisa's Troubles
The interrogation room upstairs has sat there unused for two years now... It would be a much more lively place if Hertha would agree to let me use it as my private workshop... *sigh* She's such a spoilsport.

## Favorite Food
I like making my own vegetable soup. I put a big bunch of vegetables into a cauldron and stir it with a long spoon. What does it taste like? Here, why don't you try it for yourself. Open wide!

## Least Favorite Food
I suffer from extreme pumpkinphobia. The fall harvest is a difficult time of year for me, as you can imagine. I wonder if it would be worth the trouble to make all the pumpkins in the world disappear...

## Receiving a Gift: I
Oh aren't you just the sweetest? Thanks, cutie, you just made my day.

## Receiving a Gift: II
Hehe, you've really got a knack for this, haven't you?

## Receiving a Gift: III
Eugh... Oh my... This is really... hmm...

## Birthday
Here, take this amulet, it will bring you good luck. It's my birthday gift to you. I spent a long time making it, so don't lose it now!

## Feelings About Ascension: Intro
Surely you don't want me working overtime... That would be no good.

## Feelings About Ascension: Building Up
Chances to practice should be left to you newcomers, no?

## Feelings About Ascension: Climax
*chuckles* If I were to recover my full power, who knows what kind of things might happen?

## Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion
I've already tried to persuade you every way possible... *sigh* Have it your way, cutie. I can no longer go on pretending at this point — even a Hilichurl would see through the act. So be it, let me introduce you to the true Witch of Purple Rose.

## Elemental Skill: I
*giggles*

## Elemental Skill: II
You're in for a little shock.

## Elemental Skill: III
Come a little closer.

## Elemental Skill: IV
...Blitz!

## Elemental Skill: V
You've been a naughty boy!

## Elemental Skill: VI
Hehe~

## Elemental Burst: I
Let's spark things up a little.

## Elemental Burst: II
Surrender and I'll be gentle.

## Elemental Burst: III
Try not to enjoy this too much.

## Opening Treasure Chest: I
No pain no gain, haha...

## Opening Treasure Chest: II
Oh my...

## Opening Treasure Chest: III
What do you think, cutie?

## Low HP: I
I have some for you too.

## Low HP: II
I'm a bit rusty...

## Low HP: III
Oh no, I'm gonna ruin my gloves.

## Ally at Low HP: I
Don't force it, darling.

## Ally at Low HP: II
Do you need me to lend a hand?

## Fallen: I
Going out is tiring...

## Fallen: II
Looks like I got carried away...

## Fallen: III
I knew I should have stayed home...

## Light Hit Taken: I
Ugh...

## Heavy Hit Taken: I
Don't be such a brute.

## Joining Party: I
Here, let me help you.

## Joining Party: II
I'll keep an eye on you.

## Joining Party: III
Ooh, you're taking me out?
