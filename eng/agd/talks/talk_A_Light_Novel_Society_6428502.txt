Traveler: A Light Novel Society?
Aryadeva: There are many societies in the Akademiya, but no Light Novel Society. It's strange, isn't it?
Aryadeva: Light novels don't seem popular in Sumeru, but it is the Nation of Wisdom after all. There shouldn't be any gaps in our fields of knowledge.
Aryadeva: I am not exactly a researcher of the Akademiya, but I am second to none when it comes to light novels.
Aryadeva: Should we have an initiation ceremony or something like that?
