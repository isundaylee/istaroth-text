# This Ain't Your Daddy's Iridescence Tour...


## Talk 1

Dvorak: Feel free to take a look around, I'll be with you in just a moment.

## Talk 2

Arataki Itto: Don't you worry, Jack-Attack! We'll find that dog, even if it's hiding in Tenshukaku.
Dvorak: Itto... It's just a myth...
Traveler: What dog?
Arataki Itto: Whoa! Compadre! And Paimon!
Arataki Itto: You finally made it! Man, have I missed you guys! Hahahahaha!
Arataki Itto: Oh yeah — and this is Dvorak, a musician from Fontaine. Jack-Attack, you know these two, right?
Paimon: Hey! Mr. Dvorak! It's you!
Dvorak: Hehe, ah, it's so wonderful to see you both again. I feel like that Lantern Rite was just yesterday. How've you been?
Paimon: Pretty good! So how did you end up hanging around with Itto? Is he helping you with the Iridescence Tour now?
Arataki Itto: You'd better believe it, Mini Melon! But that's only half the story.
Arataki Itto: This is no ordinary Iridescence Tour. Me and Jack-Attack are teaming up to turn this into the "Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness"!
Paimon: Rockin' for Life? What do you know about rock 'n' roll, Bull-Chucker?
Arataki Itto: Huh? What, you never heard of Bull-Chucker Rock before?
Arataki Itto: Moo moo moo... *stomp stomp stomp*
Arataki Itto: Don't try and understand it, Mini Melon, it'll melt your mind! It's about lettin' loose! C'mon, give us some Lavender Melon Rock!
Paimon: Okay, speak for yourself, mister... Sounds like you're the one whose mind is melting!
Traveler: Just to backtrack a little — what's this dog you were talking about?
Dvorak: Heh... Just a local legend I heard about. Apparently, there was a war between the islands of Narukami and Watatsumi not too long ago. Is that right?
Arataki Itto: Such a waste... When will people learn? Make rock 'n' roll, guys, not war.
Dvorak: A tragedy, to be sure. Countless animals were affected by the fallout. A raven, a bake-danuki, a weasel thief, and many more sustained injuries...
Paimon: Um... Fair point, the animals didn't deserve that. But, uh... And not to downplay it or anything but... Didn't even worse stuff happen than that?
Arataki Itto: In the eyes of a rocker, all living things are equally important.
Traveler: So did this dog get injured, too?
Dvorak: No, the story goes that this dog was something like a ninken. It would show up out of nowhere in the middle of a battle to rescue the injured animals and take them to safety.
Arataki Itto: Rockin' and rollin' to the rescue! A king among canines! There'll always be a place for him in the Arataki Gang.
Traveler: Where did you hear about this?
Dvorak: In Ritou. I was actually there while the war was going on.
Dvorak: It inspired me to write a song about it. I was even planning to host a music festival around the same theme, but unfortunately I couldn't convince my investors.
Arataki Itto: Oh, yeah, I heard all about that... They claimed that they had to cancel their plans because of an accident at sea. But that was just a lame excuse.
Dvorak: Yes, they weren't optimistic about the potential return on investment. Plus... I don't know, there seemed to be some other risks they were worried about.
Paimon: What kind of risks?
Dvorak: Good question... Risks only apparent to people with Mora to throw around, I suppose?
Arataki Itto: I agree. When people have too much Mora, they lose their rock 'n' roll spirit.
Paimon: They do, huh? So what do you mean by rock 'n' roll spirit, anyway?
Arataki Itto: Y'know! The spirit of, uh... You rock up, you rock out, roll the dice, and roll with the punches! That sorta stuff!
Paimon: Huh... By that definition, aren't the investors the most rock 'n' roll people in this scenario?
Arataki Itto: Anyway, point is — those chumps are out, and Arataki Itto is in! I'm running the show from here on out.
Paimon: Yeah, right! How are YOU gonna fill in for the investors? Do you even have any Mora?
Dvorak: I have faith in Itto. He tells me that the Arataki Gang is a small but well-known and influential organization in this area, and has even been known to rub shoulders with the local authorities. Isn't that right?
Paimon: "Rub shoulders" is putting it mildly... More like, they're always locking horns...
Arataki Itto: Hey! Don't look down your nose at the Arataki Gang! I got connections, alright? Even the Tri-Commission listens to what I have to say!
Paimon: Okay, Mr. Big Shot, whatever you say...
Arataki Itto: You can doubt it all you want, Mini Melon, but it's the truth. You know that guy in the Yashiro Commission? Well, he and I are officially bros! That's right, I'm talking about Thoma, housekeeper extraordinaire!
Arataki Itto: And there's the general from the Tenryou Commission. Kujou Tengu. I mean, sure, we're always ribbing each other, but it comes from a place of deep mutual respect!
Paimon: Mutual? ...Yeah, Paimon's not so sure about that.
Traveler: So what about the Kanjou Commission?
Arataki Itto: Okay, fair, no first-name contacts there... But the Arataki Gang is a big contributor to their revenue stream! All those fines we pay...
Dvorak: F—Fines!?
Arataki Itto: Huh? No! I meant, uh... taxes! Hehehe... Yeah...
Arataki Itto: But that's not all! Let's not forget my contacts outside of the Tri-Commission! Amazing, talented people from all walks of life, like, uh... Ooh! Like the TCG legend, Ayato! Oh yeah, he's made quite a name for himself in the TCG circles.
Arataki Itto: In fact, they got a saying now: "Ayato of the South, Itto of the North." That's right, I'm the only serious competition he's got in all of Inazuma!
Paimon: Did you make that saying up!?
Arataki Itto: Then there's the fox lady, VIP customer of Yukio's ramen stall and fellow participant in the Ramen Masters Championship. I was her only worthy opponent.
Arataki Itto: Also, you know that lonely god in Tenshukaku? Well, guess what? Turns out it was her life-long wish to catch one of Arataki Itto's events!
Arataki Itto: During the Drumalong festival, the Tenryou Commission were worried that their Almighty Shogun might have too much fun and lose interest in running the government. That's why they invited me over to stay for a couple of days.
Paimon: Well look at you, sounds like you're really going up in the world. At this rate, you'll have made shogun by the next time we see you... And then Paimon'll have to call you "Almighty Bull-Chucker."
Traveler: The Arataki Gang never ceases to amaze.
Dvorak: Ahem, well... I'll admit, I heard a few exaggerations there myself, but regardless, Itto has helped me secure a venue for this event. And for that, I owe him my thanks.
Arataki Itto: Ah, it's nothing, don't mention it! My bro Gorou sorted it all out for me — let's both go thank him later.
Paimon: Wait, you know Gorou!?
Arataki Itto: Yep. I always knew him as General Gorou of the resistance fighters, but I had no idea there was more to the story! Turns out, he has another identity...
Traveler: What other identity?
Arataki Itto: You've heard of Ms. Hina, right?
Paimon: MS. HINA!? So you—!
Arataki Itto: Hey, no need to yell, alright? Yes, Ms. Hina. She's the one who told me.
Arataki Itto: After falling for the Tenryou Commission's tricks at the Drumalong Festival, I figured I'd find a new location this time. Somewhere out of their reach. Like here, for example.
Arataki Itto: So, I wrote Ms. Hina a letter, asking if she knew anything about the procedure for holding an event on Watatsumi Island.
Arataki Itto: She wrote me back right away, and said I could ask Watatsumi Island's General for help... and that his name was "Gorou."
Arataki Itto: I was like, whaaaat!? General Gorou is the general of all Watatsumi Island!
Paimon: Whew, that was close... Paimon's with you now, but... what did you think general meant?
Arataki Itto: What do you mean? Isn't it like, one general per squad, or something?
Paimon: That's called a captain!
Arataki Itto: Really? Huh. Well, either way, if it wasn't for Ms. Hina, I never woulda known... Pretty rock 'n' roll! Hahahahaha!
Traveler: So rock 'n' roll!
Arataki Itto: Alright — good chat, compadre. I just remembered, I got a meeting with Gorou coming up — gonna ask him about that dog situation. Gonna have to love ya and leave ya for now.
Traveler: Sure you don't want us to join? We could help.
Arataki Itto: Hahahahaha! You guys focus on having a blast here at the festival! I think I can handle this little canine conundrum.
Arataki Itto: There's still a few days until the big party, so not everything's set up yet. But the Jam Zone and the Roasted Lavender Melon Zone are ready for action!
Arataki Itto: Have fun, compadre! Gotta dash!
Dvorak: *sigh* What a character... Gotta admire his enthusiasm, though.
Dvorak: Looks like it's just the three of us for now. Why don't I show you the Jam Zone to start with?
Traveler: Hahahahaha!

## Talk 3

Dvorak: Here we are. I've supplied musical scores and instruments from various regions, including a horn I personally brought from Fontaine. You can play whatever music you like.
Dvorak: If you get tired, the Roasted Lavender Melon Zone is just over there. Itto says that Lavender Melons are, *clears throat*, rock 'n' roll fuel. So, what do you think? Wanna give it a try?
Traveler: I guess that makes Paimon "Flying Rock 'N' Roll Fuel."
Paimon: Hey, cut that out! Lucky Itto's gone, otherwise Paimon would never hear the end of it.
Paimon: Let's change the topic. What other fun stuff is there to do here, Mr. Dvorak?
Dvorak: Well, we're planning to invite some more music enthusiasts, and we're still getting some supplies together so we can decorate the place a little.
Dvorak: But it could take some time. The Arataki Gang has shifted their focus to the dog situation ever since I brought it up...
Dvorak: Only one of them is actually sticking to the plan. Her name is Kuki Shinobu — she's out delivering invitations right now.
Paimon: Yep, that's the Arataki Gang for ya. Everyone else goofs around while Shinobu gets things done.
Paimon: We should help out! We can't let this event get totally derailed when Shinobu's out there doing her part!
Dvorak: Oh, I mean... Are you sure?
Traveler: Absolutely. We can handle it.
Dvorak: That would be extremely useful... We're starting to get behind schedule, and a couple extra pairs of hands could make all the difference.
Paimon: No problem, we're happy to help! So you need us to find some music lovers and gather materials for decorating. Was that it?
Dvorak: Exactly. According to the original plan, we aim to finish everything in five days, and then the big party can begin.
Dvorak: Actually, give me a second — I'll make you a checklist of all the outstanding tasks, that way it'll all be clearer.
Dvorak: Oh, also... One other tidbit to share with you: Itto is planning to perform a song on stage on the final day of the event.
Paimon: Ugh, typical Bull-Chucker! Always has to be the center of attention!
Traveler: Why don't you do a song too, Paimon?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon would steal the show for sure. No one would give Itto a second look after that.
Paimon: Pretty sure he'd yell out "Paimon's so rock 'n' roll it hurts!" And then run off the stage bawling his eyes out.
Dvorak: Haha, those are some bold claims, Ms. Paimon. But that kind of confidence would serve you well on the stage.
Paimon: Ah, Paimon's just kidding. Anyway, we'll be ready for that checklist as soon as it's done, Mr. Dvorak!
Dvorak: Great. Feel free to take a look around. I'll bring it over in a few minutes.

## Talk 4

Shikanoin Heizou: #Well, well, well! If it isn't {NICKNAME} and Paimon!
Paimon: Whoa! Shinobu... and Heizou! What a surprise!
Shikanoin Heizou: This truly is a pleasant surprise... although, not that surprising to be honest. I was just telling Ms. Shinobu that I had a sneaking suspicion we might run into you.
Kuki Shinobu: Hehe, Doushin Shikanoin was talking about you constantly the whole way here. I guess the universe answered his prayers.
Shikanoin Heizou: It's called intuition. Names pop into my head at relevant moments — just the way my mind works.
Traveler: It's great to see you both.
Paimon: Paimon sure wasn't expecting Heizou to be the first one to show up.
Kuki Shinobu: Boss nagged me to prioritize the Tenryou Commission invitations. He specifically requested Madam Kujou Sara and Doushin Shikanoin.
Paimon: So... why isn't Sara here?
Shikanoin Heizou: Almost certainly because she has no desire whatsoever to see Itto. In her defense, here's what was written on the invitation letter:
Shikanoin Heizou: "Kujou Tengu! Come meet me at the top of the Sangonomiya Shrine! Let's go nuts and have a totally rock 'n' roll sumo wrestling match!"
Kuki Shinobu: If I were Kujou Sara, I'd jump at the chance to throw Itto off the roof.
Paimon: But then wouldn't Kokomi come and throw Sara off, too? All that stomping around on her roof... the noise would drive her crazy.
Kuki Shinobu: Yeah, haha... Well anyway, Madam Kujou Sara's response was much more magnanimous than mine would've been. She gave us a basket of Lavender Melons to bring as a gift.
Shikanoin Heizou: Magnanimous...? Hehe, I'm not so sure. Something tells me she's trying to send a message.
Paimon: What message?
Shikanoin Heizou: "If that oni brat wants to pick a fight with me, there'll be plenty of Lavender Melons waiting for him at the Police Station."
Paimon: Hm, maybe the fact you assume that says more about you than her! So what about the other basket of Lavender Melons, huh? Is that one from you? What message are you trying to send?
Shikanoin Heizou: Haha, the other basket is actually from a few of us at the Police Station. I chipped in, and so did some other Doushin who've arrested Itto before... and so did some of Itto's former cellmates.
Shikanoin Heizou: So I guess this basket of Lavender Melons is our way of saying: "There'll always be a place for you here!"
Kuki Shinobu: Maybe just give Boss the melons, and don't mention that part.
Shikanoin Heizou: #Sure. Well, my work here is done, anyway. Now that I've delivered the Lavender Melons and said hello to {NICKNAME}, I should probably get going.
Paimon: Uh, aren't you gonna stay for the event?
Shikanoin Heizou: Don't worry, I'll definitely be back for the big party. But I have some business to attend to in Ritou first.
Paimon: Yeesh, being a detective sounds busy. They got you running around all over the place... Oh, wait! Ritou! Do you happen to know anything about a mystery ninken that appeared during the war? Apparently, a lot of people in Ritou were talking about it.
Shikanoin Heizou: Ah, the dog, yes...? That was the inspiration behind this music festival, wasn't it? Shinobu told me all about it.
Paimon: Oh... Never mind, Paimon just thought a detective might have the inside scoop.
Shikanoin Heizou: I'm only speculating here, but from experience, I'd say it's probably just a local legend. I doubt the dog even exists.
Shikanoin Heizou: What's wrong? From the look on your face, you've got a vested interest in this situation...
Shikanoin Heizou: Interesting... Well, since I'm going to Ritou anyway, I can always ask around and see where it leads.
Traveler: Are you sure it won't impact your work?
Shikanoin Heizou: Don't be silly. If this matters to you, that's a good sign that it'll turn out to be something that interests me, too.
Shikanoin Heizou: Hehe, stay tuned for more info. See you all soon!
Kuki Shinobu: Seems like Doushin Shikanoin's quite the lone wolf. Well, I'd better get back to delivering these invitations. Gotta make sure the big party's a success.
Paimon: In that case, guess it's time for us to get to work too. Wonder how that checklist is coming along...
Dvorak: Sorry to keep you waiting — here's that list for ya. If you can work your way through all this, we'll be back on track.
Paimon: Great, perfect timing, Mr. Dvorak! We'll get on it right away.
Dvorak: Thank you, I'm very grateful for your help. If you feel like flexing your musical muscles to take a break at any point, just come and find me in the Jam Zone.
Traveler: How much do you charge for your services?
