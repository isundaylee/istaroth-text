Traveler: And you are?
Sergeant Lin: I'm Lin, the Sergeant of Millelith's troops here in Chenyu Vale. I'm in charge of border defense and the defense of Yilong Wharf.
Sergeant Lin: The flow of people here in Yilong Wharf is only a little slower than in Liyue Harbor, but we have a limited number of troops, so things are extremely difficult.
Sergeant Lin: I was sent here because of my youth and high stamina, which are required for the heavy workload here.
Sergeant Lin: On the other hand, constantly training our young soldiers is also key for our forces to improve continuously.
Sergeant Lin: The border defense of Chenyu Vale and the defense of Yilong Wharf have seen no trouble since I took up the post.
