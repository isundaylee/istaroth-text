Traveler: The books from what place in Ritou now?
Aratani: Well, I mean, my job relies on creativity, so I have to learn new stuff, right?
Aratani: That's why I often ask friends to send me new books from overseas. If there are some impounded books over in Ritou, I will also tell them to bring them in.
Aratani: You have to keep that whole "impounded books" business a secret for me, alright? In exchange, I'll let you read the new stuff next time.
