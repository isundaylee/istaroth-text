Traveler: About Qishan...
Erfan: Qishan is the bartender during the day. Have you met her already?
Erfan: She's a student from Liyue who is now preparing for the entrance exam to the Akademiya. She also works to cover her tuition. That's hardly an easy life.
Erfan: I want to help, but I'm from a different school than the one she's aiming for.
Erfan: So I sometimes invite students from that school over for a drink. This way, she can discuss academic questions with them.
Erfan: I hope she will pass the exam. That will make me her senior!
