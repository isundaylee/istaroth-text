# Cottage Kitchen

A detailed step-by-step blueprint for making a "Cottage Kitchen."
A fully equipped kitchen with a cabinet full of carefully prepared seasonings.
Chefs seeking excellence will buy fresh ingredients from the market daily, and true culinary artists will even pay close attention to the firewood used in their stoves. The young head chef of Wanmin Restaurant once shared that to make the traditional dishes of Qingce Village, one must first place dry bamboo chips into the stove and carefully control the flame. If one can process the shrubbery near Wolfhooks into thin firewood, one can even add a little Mondstadt flair in.
Different kinds of firewood produce vastly different effects, and most chefs will never truly master them. As such, Wanmin Restaurant has a monopoly on this particular technique.
