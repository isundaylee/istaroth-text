Traveler: About Ararakalari...
Arabalika: Before many sunrises, Arabalika was so weak in Ararakalari, almost weak as Paimon. Back then, Aradasha could kick the Big Iron Chunks over.
Arabalika: Later, when Arabalika finally beats running mushroom, Aradasha is nowhere to be found.
Arabalika: That's bad. With no Aranara to kick the Big Iron Chunks over, the Big Iron Chunks will stomp their feet and turn Vanarana into a huge mess.
Arabalika: Luckily, the Big Iron Chunks now can't beat Arabalika. It must be blessings from Aradasha.
