Traveler: What are you doing?
Old Finch: Oh, me? I'm chatting with the Spring Fairy.
Old Finch: My name's Finch. Haha, but I'm old now, as you can see, so everyone calls me Old Finch.
Traveler: Tell the Fairy I said hello.
Old Finch: ...Of course, of course. She likes everyone around these parts.
Old Finch: Way back when, she used to sneak into people's dreams to see the scenes being woven there.
Old Finch: Now, she even likes poems. She often reads them to me in my dreams.
Old Finch: Hahaha, but there's so much more she still wants to learn.

## Talk 1

Traveler: What else do you and the Spring Fairy talk about?
Old Finch: Oh, anything and everything.
Old Finch: When I was younger, we used to talk a lot here...
Old Finch: About the weather and the water. About the fish in the spring, and about which townsfolk were arguing again...
Old Finch: We'd talk about which kids had fallen into the water. She'd secretly help them get out, and always made sure they found a few pretty stones to make them feel better, too...
Old Finch: She's very kind, you see.
Old Finch: Of course, the townspeople don't believe in her. They think she's a fairy tale. Haha! Maybe that's for the best...

## Talk 2

Traveler: Well, enjoy your conversations.
Old Finch: We will. There's always something for us to talk about...

## Talk 3

Old Finch: Spring fairy... Oh, spring fairy...

Old Finch: Who are you?
Old Finch: I'm Finch, haha. I'm also old, as you can see, which is why they all call me Old Finch.
Old Finch: What are you here for? Are you... are you here for the spring fairy, too?

Old Finch: Spring fairy?
Old Finch: Yes, there's a fairy in this spring. You wouldn't have heard of it, and none of the villagers believe in it.
Old Finch: But when I was a boy, I would talk to her here all the time...
Old Finch: We'd talk about the weather, the spring water, the fish, who had fallen out with who in the village...
Old Finch: And when a kid fell into the spring, she'd tell me how she had secretly helped them back out and given them a few pretty stones to make them feel better...
Old Finch: She is a gentle-natured fairy.
Old Finch: But suddenly, one day, she refused to see me any longer.
Old Finch: So... what are you doing here?
Old Finch: How many years now... thirty? No — forty?
Old Finch: Well anyway, it's been half a lifetime that I've waited here, just hoping to see her one last time... and to hear her wonderful, flowing voice...
Old Finch: But after all this time, I'm sure she's probably... gone...
Old Finch: Whenever I have that thought, I realize... Look how old I am now... Too old to go traveling around Teyvat looking for her...
Old Finch: So all I can do is wait here, on the off chance that there's still some hope.
