# A Very Volatile Treasure


## Talk 1

Paimon: Klee? You're here too?
Klee: I... *sobbing* I turned myself in.
Paimon: ...Huh?
Klee: *sobbing* I... M—My bomb... I—I hurt someone...
Klee: *sobbing* I broke the rules... I'll never see the light of day again...
Traveler: Wait! There's been a misunderstanding.
Jean: Klee, I need you to answer me. You said someone was injured. Where are they?
Traveler: The person that Klee blew up was an Abyss Mage.
Jean: Why is that?
Klee: But... But Mr. Fluffball was only a thief... He didn't deserve to blow up...
Paimon: Hey, come on now... Paimon already told you that the Abyss Mages are the bad guys...
Paimon: And actually, they're the worst kind of bad guys you can imagine. They don't just hate the good guys, they hate all people... Their enemy is... humanity itself.
Klee: Mr. Fluffball... was a bad guy on purpose? ...Mr. Fluffball is the enemy of humanity!?
Klee: Wha... what!? I don't get it!
Jean: This was an oversight on my part.
Jean: I did not tell you these things before because you are still young.
Traveler: Because of Mondstadt's most powerful treasure?
Jean: In fact, the Abyss Order is a hostile force in Mondstadt which has been unusually active lately.
Paimon: Aha, that's it! Paimon understands now!
Paimon: They were tracking down poor Klee because they'd heard rumors about her treasure!
Paimon: Just like the way Paimon's first reaction was to try and get her hands on... ahh, no— to try and get the facts on the treasure.
Klee: So... does that mean...
Jean: In light of your contribution on this matter, I will allow you to take part in the next Ludi Harpastum.
Traveler: You got very lucky!
Traveler: I'm so happy for you!
Klee: Ludi Harpastum! Whoa!
Klee: #{M#Mr.}{F#Miss} Honorary Knight, you've gotta come too!
Paimon: Woop-de-doo, it's a happy ending!
Jean: Except...
Paimon: ...Except what?
Jean: Klee, where did you hide the treasure to begin with?
Klee: I... Um...
Jean: Were you trying to blow up the fish in Starfell Lake again?
Klee: I wasn't! I swear I wasn't!
Traveler: (Uh-oh, Jean noticed it too...)
Paimon: (She's giving us that look that means, play along...)
Jean: Klee?
Klee: I'll see myself to <color=#00E1FFFF>solitary confinement</color>... *sobbing*
Paimon: Paimon bets Klee must get bored in there all by herself...

## Talk 2

Paimon: Guess whooo~?
Solitary Confinement: That's Paimon's voice I hear!
Traveler: Need help busting out of this joint?
Solitary Confinement: Ooh, ooh, yes, please! Wait — no, I... I can't. Klee needs to be a good girl and think about what she did... Stop tempting me!
Solitary Confinement: Anyway, while I'm grounded, I'm making an extra-special new treasure... the Ludi Harpastum version!
Paimon: When you say "treasure..."
Solitary Confinement: Tee-hee... I made it into the shape of a harpastum and everything! It looks so cute...
Traveler: You disguised a bomb as a harpastum!?
Solitary Confinement: Just wait for Ludi Harpastum, oh yeah... They're gonna love it!
Paimon: Yeesh, if Jean was listening to this...
Paimon: Klee might find herself grounded for an awful lot longer.
Traveler: So... another bomb?
Traveler: Need a bite to eat or anything?
