Wagner: You're asking me where to find more ore? Hmph. Looking for it yourself would be far too much trouble, I take it...
Wagner: Luckily for you, I do know a few spots, having been in the trade this long. Never had the time to check them out myself is all.
Wagner: Tell you what, I'll mark out the locations for you â€” just make sure you come to me when you need any forging done, got it? Give me your map...
Wagner: ...Right, done. Crystal Ore deposits all marked out for you. Don't make me regret telling you.
