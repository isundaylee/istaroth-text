# Give Her Memories


## Talk 1

Cyno: Let's start with the Grand Bazaar. We should ask around for clues.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Mr. Zubayr!
Sheikh Zubayr: Oh, hello. Did you need something?
Paimon: We're looking for Nilou. Do you know where she is?
Sheikh Zubayr: Nilou? She left bright and early this morning. Said she had to help out a friend.
Cyno: Was she by herself? And did you happen to see which gate she used to leave the city?
Sheikh Zubayr: She definitely left alone. As for the direction... I think she left through the gate to the north.
Cyno: ...So, the complete opposite direction of Pardis Dhyai.
Sheikh Zubayr: Did something happen? This is no time for practical jokes, you know.
Cyno: Mr. Zubayr, could you send word to Pardis Dhyai if Nilou comes back to the Grand Bazaar?
Sheikh Zubayr: Of course. I'm sure she just got caught up in something. Still, let me know when you find her.
Cyno: We will.
Cyno: Alright, let's leave through the north gate and see what we can find.

## Talk 3

Cyno: Miss Nevida, have you seen Nilou this morning?
Nevida: Nilou? Oh, yes! I saw her head out of the city. She was wearing the prettiest outfit...
Paimon: Which way did she go?
Nevida: That way, I believe.
Cyno: Was there anyone following her? Did everything look okay?
Nevida: I mean, it looked like she was in a good mood. She even stopped to say hello. And no... I didn't see anyone else.
Cyno: Alright, thank you.

## Talk 4

Cyno: Excuse me, have any of you seen Miss Nilou from Zubayr Theater come this way?
City Gate Guard (Rukn): Yes, General. I saw Miss Nilou cross the bridge after leaving the city this morning. There was a man waiting for her on the other side.
Paimon: Wait, could that be the person who bought the second gem!?
Cyno: Did you see the man's face?
City Gate Guard (Rukn): Unfortunately, no. He was too far away.
Cyno: ...Understood. If she comes back this way, tell her to find me at Pardis Dhyai.
City Gate Guard (Rukn): Yes, General!
Cyno: Let's keep going.

## Talk 5

Paimon: The trail ends here... and there's no one else we can ask for clues.
Candace: There are intersecting sets of footprints on the ground. We could try tracking some of them...
Cyno: With this many traces, it's easy to get mixed up. Let me take a closer look...
Traveler: (Wait! That figure, it's...)
Traveler: Excuse me for a moment, you two.
Cyno: Sure. We'll continue analyzing the footprints over here.
Candace: Tell us right away if you find anything.

## Talk 6

Cyno: We should be getting close.
Paimon: This area is usually full of Treasure Hoarders. Nilou could be in danger...

## Talk 7

Candace: Look over there!
Paimon: It's Nilou! Heyyyyyy!
Cyno: I don't think she can hear us. We're too far away.
Paimon: C'mon, let's go!

## Talk 8

Sorush: Behold my might!

## Talk 9

Mihir: Careful, Sorush! Don't get too low, or they might see you!

## Talk 10

Hizir: B—Bombs! There are bombs falling from the sky!
Aruj: Agh!
Yakup: Stop panicking! Get the wagon out first!

## Talk 11

Traveler: (All the preparations are done. Wait until the start of the parade tomorrow?)

## Talk 12

Sorush: Hmph, perish, you scoundrels!
Sethos: They've probably had enough, don't you think?
Sorush: Who might you be?
Sethos: The name's Sethos. I was out for a walk when I heard the commotion, so I came to check it out.
Sethos: Since you already destroyed their goods, I'd say you can stop here. These kinds of situations can easily get out of hand.
Sorush: Brazen youth, have you any idea to whom you speak?
Sethos: The Bloomguard, Sorush — renowned among the Pari. All children of the desert know your name.
Sorush: So, you're not entirely ignorant after all... Fine — I'm willing to call it a day.
Sorush: But if those scoundrels continue to disrupt the peace of this land, I will show no mercy!

## Talk 13

Paimon: Phew, we're done! Now, we just have to go to the Sanctuary of Surasthana and hang the decorations on the Flower Carriage!
Paimon: Wonder what the Sanctuary looks like the night before the Festival... Let's go check it out!

## Talk 14

Dehya: You're finally back! I was so worried! I was THIS close to sending some mercs after you!
Collei: Nothing bad happened, right?
Paimon: Nope! It was all just a misunderstanding!
Tighnari: ...That's a relief. I'm glad it's all taken care of.
Paimon: How are the preparations going?
Tighnari: Well, Kaveh's diagram is done. It looked like he pulled an all-nighter to finish it, so he went home to sleep.
Dehya: We built the frame of the tower while you were gone.
Dunyarzad: I think I'll check it over later, though. We were so worried about you all, it was kind of hard to focus...
Tighnari: In any case, there's not much left to do. If we all work together, we'll be done in no time.
Paimon: Great! We don't have to worry about missing the Parade!
Tighnari: #Speaking of the Parade, could I ask you for a favor, Traveler?
Traveler: Sure, as long as it's something I can do.
Tighnari: The Akademiya wants the representatives from each Darshan to nominate someone to serve as the Knight of Flowers for the Parade.
Tighnari: After some discussion, we all agreed you would be the best person for the job. What do you think?
Traveler: It would by my honor.
Tighnari: Great! You're the hero of Sumeru and a personal friend of the Dendro Archon. We all thought you were the best candidate.
Dehya: Make sure you knock it out of the park!
Collei: #Hey, don't stress him out!
Dehya: Wait, aren't you also in the Parade this time, Candace? You're... playing the tanbur, right?
Candace: Yes. I'm providing the background music for Miss Nilou's dance.
Paimon: Whoa! Paimon's never heard you play music before!
Candace: Heh... If you like it, you're welcome in Aaru Village any time. I'm more than happy to lull you to sleep.
Traveler: You can count on it!
Dunyarzad: Actually, I have a favor to ask as well.
Dunyarzad: These are the decorations for the Flower Carriage. Could you bring them to the Sanctuary of Surasthana and hang them on the Carriage?
Dunyarzad: It would mean a lot to have the Knight of Flowers personally decorate it!
Traveler: My pleasure.
Paimon: You can count on us!
Black Screen Text: Everyone splits up the remaining tasks. The anticipation for the Festival makes for quick work...
Black Screen Text: Before you know it, the sun has set, and everyone breaks for the night.
Traveler: Looking forward to it.
Traveler: Yeah, anytime.

## Talk 15

Paimon: That should be good! All we need to do now is to wait for the parade tomorrow!

## Talk 16

Traveler: *Wait until tomorrow.*
Nahida: ...
Nahida: (Everyone's been avoiding me lately. They're acting squirrely... like they're hiding something.)
Nahida: (I have to get to the bottom of this after the Parade!)
Nahida: (But first... birthday celebrations, with delicious candy, a beautiful Flower Carriage, and...)
Nahida: Ah...!
Traveler: Sorry to keep you waiting, dear Archon.
Nahida: ...Time to head out, dear Knight of Flowers!

## Talk 17

Kaveh: Here's to a successful birthday surprise!
Kaveh (Crowd): Cheers!
Faruzan: Hah, I knew it! I knew you had it in you!
Faruzan: Kaveh, you truly are a genius architect!
Kaveh: Um... Madame Faruzan, I think you might have had a little too much to drink...
Tighnari: She hasn't been able to contain her excitement since she saw the candy tower hit the Flower Carriage. I even saw her sneak a few extra drinks just now...
Dehya: Hey, we all deserve to loosen up once in a while! That's what festivals are for!
Dehya: By the way, Candace, your playing was amazing out there! How come you've never showed us before?
Candace: Oh, it's just something I do in passing. When the night watch is calm, and the stars are out, I like to play a few tunes to pass the time.
Nilou: You're saying the stars in the sky get to hear you play more than us? No fair...
Candace: Honestly, I think Miss Nilou's dancing was the real star of the event.
Nilou: Wait, when did this become about me...?
Alhaitham: I see. So, the Wedjat Eye is now under the custody of the Temple of Silence.
Sethos: You can borrow it for research, if you want.
Alhaitham: No need. Certain objects merely represent a period of history. Once the events they exemplify are brought to light, there's little value in further study.
Kaveh: Huh, I thought you'd at least want to see it. A legendary gem like that is sure to be a wonder to behold. Couldn't hurt to take a look...
Alhaitham: I'm not about to make the trip to the Temple of Silence for that. It's too far.
Kaveh: You and your hermit tendencies, I swear...
Alhaitham: Although, if someone ever brings it to the Akademiya for appraisal and certification, I wouldn't mind taking a look.
Cyno: On that topic, I wonder how much it's worth...
Sethos: I've never really thought about it... It's kind of like an ancient palace, in a way. Not many people are going to break off a piece of the wall and send it for appraisal...
Kaveh: Uh, that actually sounds like something my Darshan would do. I've heard some of the underclassmen have quite the sense of curiosity...
Alhaitham: Well, if that does happen, write a report and send it to my office.
Kaveh: Huh? Is that protocol or something?
Alhaitham: No. I just like to know when interesting things are brought back to the Akademiya. I might want to check it out...
Kaveh: Why did I even bother asking... I should just keep my mouth shut.
Tighnari: Interesting... You use reports as a sort of alarm clock system...
Cyno: An alarm! Yes, that's what I heard just now. Dear friends, a critical moment has arrived...
Sethos: Wait, I didn't hear anything. It's not like Hermanubis would call on you and not me...
Cyno: It is time... to come together... and play Genius In—
Tighnari: Is that Collei calling me? Sorry, gotta go...
Sethos: *sigh* Genius Invokation this, and Genius Invokation that... When's Collei gonna give me an excuse to leave...?
Nahida: Everyone seems to be having a lot of fun.
Traveler: What about you? Are you having fun?
Nahida: Yeah! I just know... this will be the most unforgettable birthday I'll ever have!
Sorush: Great Archon, you have a long life ahead of you. Isn't it too early to draw such a conclusion?
Nahida: Not at all! Sometimes, a single moment is all it takes to know you'll remember something for the rest of your life!
Nahida: Your name is Sorush, right? Would you and your friends ever consider coming to live in Sumeru City?
Sorush: Um... Thank you for your kindness, great Archon, but we Pari have our own duties... And we find the city a bit too noisy.
Nahida: Is that so? If you spend more time among people, you might start to enjoy the commotion, hehe.
Sorush: Well, that's also true. I have fond memories of my adventures with Pale Floater and my Yasnapati.
Paimon: Aw, really? Paimon's happy to hear that!
Paimon: It felt like this year's Sabzeruz Festival had surprises for everyone!
Paimon: When you called out the Aranara, Paimon nearly fell out of the sky in shock!
Nahida: Hehe, I'm glad you liked it! I told them to stay hidden so no one knew what was coming.
Paimon: No wonder Arasaka was so flustered! He was trying to keep it a secret!
Paimon: Paimon's sure everyone in Sumeru loved the surprise. It felt like a dream!
Nahida: A dream, huh...
Paimon: Nahida?
Nahida: Oh, it's nothing. I was just wondering... if this whole thing might be a dream...
Traveler: (...)
Traveler: Then, we should do our best to remember it!
Nahida: Huh?
Traveler: Let's capture this moment forever.
Traveler: (That must have been what Al-Ahmar wanted when he gave Rukkhadevata the Wedjat Eye.)
Traveler: (Even though we don't have anything that powerful, we still have our own way to stop time.)
Nahida: But... How can we do that?
Traveler: (Hehe...)
Kaveh: Alright, everyone, closer together, please! People on the left, make some room!
Faruzan: ...Someone is stepping on my shoe!
Collei: Ah! Sorry, Madame Faruzan! There's not a lot of space...
Sorush: Pale Floater! This spot is reserved for the mighty Pari!
Paimon: #Hmph! Paimon's the only one allowed to float next to him!
Nahida: So, that's what you meant... A picture! Haha... I never thought about it that way before.
Traveler: From now on, every time you look at the photo...
Nahida: I don't have experience with this kind of stuff, but... I trust you.
Nahida: I believe with all my heart that time will stop for us in this moment.
Tighnari: Get in the picture, Kaveh!
Kaveh: Just need to set the timer, and... We're good!
Kaveh: Everyone ready? In three, two, one...!
Collei (Crowd): Happy birthday!
Traveler: You'll remember the joy of this moment.
Traveler: So that, even if we wake up, this moment will never be lost.
