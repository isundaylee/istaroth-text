Ivanovich: The glow of the Xiao Lanterns feels so warm...
Ivanovich: Even as a stranger in this foreign city, seeing the brightly lit streets and Xiao Lanterns above in the night sky still brings some indescribable warmth to my heart.
Ivanovich: Such a warm feeling reminds me of our "Krsnik Noc" in Snezhnaya.
Ivanovich: If you ever have the chance, you must visit Snezhnaya and participate in one of our festivals.
