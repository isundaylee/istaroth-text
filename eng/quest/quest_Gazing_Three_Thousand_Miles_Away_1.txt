# Gazing Three Thousand Miles Away


## Talk 1

Chouji: #Hey there, {NICKNAME}, I didn't expect I'd see you again!
Paimon: Long time no see! How's the world outside of Yashiori Island?
Chouji: It's a lot wealthier than my hometown. They have a lot of good food and fun things to do. But... I can't say that I really like it.
Paimon: Oh? Why's that?
Chouji: The people here all seem to be missing something...
Chouji: When we used to live in Yashiori Island, Her Excellency was a distant yet calming presence to us... We didn't care where she was, but we believed that she was right there, watching us, protecting us, deciding how we should live our lives and what kind of people we should become...
Chouji: But here, Her Excellency covers everything and oppresses everything...
Chouji: *sigh* I'm not really sure how to put it...
Traveler: We're still trying.
Chouji: By the way, have you found anything concerning my mother?
Chouji: It's okay. Tell me when you have any news.

## Talk 2

Chouji: Anyway. Thank you for your help! See you around!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Read it yourself...
Chouji: Well... Okay...
Traveler: You might find her selfish...
Chouji: I'll read it.
Traveler: But please don't blame her.
Chouji: ...I understand.
Chouji: But I'll keep looking for her. Only when I find her can any of these things have meaning.
Paimon: This child... is so stubborn.

### Additional Talk 1

Chouji: #Hello, {NICKNAME}! How've you been?
Traveler: You stole my line!
Paimon: Paimon's been great, and you?
Traveler: Paimon, gunning for an extra meal, are you?
Paimon: Haha, that's 'cause you're too slow!
Traveler: You misunderstand. I mean you're the extra meal.
Paimon: Of course. Paimon could always go for an extra meal!
Paimon: Hey now!
Chouji: Pfft... Hahaha!
Chouji: All right, all right, you guys, please stop fighting.
Traveler: Sure, shoot. What is it?
Traveler: I'll see what I can do.
Chouji: I'm doing fine. But I'd like to ask you for another favor.
Chouji: #Well, it's nothing special. I just need you to help me get some more crystals, {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: I trust you, but...
Chouji: Believe me, I'll reward you for your help... As long as you trust me.
Traveler: Why?
Traveler: You promised to give me an explanation.
Chouji: But...?
Paimon: Right. We still don't know why you need so much Crystal Marrow!
Traveler: But the Shogunate has monopolized the crystal market.
Traveler: You know that these crystals aren't easy to sell, don't you?
Chouji: Well... I need money to travel so that I can find my mother, so I need to trade the crystals for money.
Traveler: You're playing a dangerous game here.
Traveler: I'm worried about your safety.
Chouji: I know, but I'll find my own way!
Chouji: ...
Paimon: We're friends, aren't we, Chouji?
Paimon: Maybe we can help you again, just like last time!
Traveler: What a mercenary philosophy...
Paimon: Besides, you promised that you'd reward us. So we have the right to know about things that might endanger your and thus affect our reward, right?
Chouji: Pfft... Paimon's right, though.
Chouji: I don't collect crystal entirely for money.
Chouji: I've been thinking... What if Mom and Dad get the disease caused by the Tatarigami, just like everyone else?
Chouji: Maybe these crystals can be used to make medicine. They grew from the bones of the giant serpent, after all...
Chouji: And Mr. Yasumoto also mentioned that these crystals may be useful.
Paimon: But you can't be sure if that's correct, can you?
Chouji: Maybe not, but we don't have anything else to go on.
Chouji: When I find Mom... or maybe even Dad, I'll take them to Sumeru. People say that they've got cure for this strange disease there.
Chouji: Before that, I can't give up any hope of finding a treatment.
Traveler: Do you even need to ask?
Traveler: I hope you can make good use of the crystals.
Chouji: Well, I've said enough. Still want to help me?
Chouji: Thank you! I won't forget this!

### Additional Talk 2

Chouji: #{NICKNAME}, you're back. Did you bring any crystals?
Traveler: Yes, I did.
Traveler: I'm on my way.
Chouji: Take your time. You can take a rest here too if you like.

### Additional Talk 3

Chouji: This should be enough Crystal Marrow. Now it's time to start my adventure!
Traveler: Take care of yourself now!
Traveler: Keep in touch!
Paimon: Paimon's still worried about this kid...
Chouji: Yeah!
Paimon: Hey, Chouji, you'd better stop running your mouth! You should feel lucky that you met us... otherwise, you'd get beaten up!
Paimon: Also, in case any bad guys want to fish for any information from you, be sure not to tell them the truth! Make up a story!
Traveler: Paimon's turning into a naggy old granny.
Paimon: And also...
Traveler: I have faith in him.
Paimon: Anyone would be worried if a little kid like him went out on an adventure all by himself!
Paimon: ...Hmph, sure you do.
Chouji: Hahahaha! Thank you, thank you both!
Chouji: I hope we'll meet again.
Paimon: Promise Paimon that you'll stay safe...
Chouji: I'll be fine!
Chouji: Next, I'll head to Tatarasuna, where Mom used to work. Maybe someone can tell me if she's been there.
Chouji: And then... I'll try to go to Narukami Island and travel to Snezhnaya via merchant ship. After that, I'll just see how things go.
Traveler: Do you know what you're talking about?
Traveler: Do you understand the risks you're taking?
Paimon: ...
Chouji: If no one went on adventures because they didn't know all the risks... Well, there wouldn't be any adventurers in the world, would there?
Traveler: Alright then...
Traveler: Just be careful.
Paimon: Ugh, this kid is sooo irritating...
Chouji: Hahaha, don't you worry about me!
Chouji: #You guys have a safe trip! By the way, {NICKNAME}, I hope that you can find your family soon, too!
Paimon: Yup! Thank you!

### Additional Talk 4

Chouji: Hello, we meet again!
Traveler: "Please get me more Crystal Marrow..."
Paimon: Wait a minute. Let Paimon guess what you're about to say...
Traveler: That's what you are going to say, right!
Paimon: "Paimon needs them urgently, boo hoo..."
Traveler: How have your travels been going?
Chouji: Hahaha, of course not!
Chouji: Good. But I still haven't found any trace of my Mom...
Traveler: We'll do our best.
Paimon: #It doesn't matter. We'll help you, too, right, {NICKNAME}?
Chouji: #Mm! I knew I could rely on you, {NICKNAME}!

### Additional Talk 5

Paimon: Read it yourself...
Chouji: Well... Okay...
Traveler: You might find her selfish...
Chouji: I'll read it.
Traveler: But please don't blame her.
Chouji: ...I understand.
Chouji: But I'll keep looking for her. Only when I find her can any of these things have meaning.
Paimon: This child... is so stubborn.

### Additional Talk 6

Chouji: Anyway. Thank you for your help! See you around!
Chouji: #Well, I don't know when I'll see you again next. I hope you'll still remember me by then, {NICKNAME}!
