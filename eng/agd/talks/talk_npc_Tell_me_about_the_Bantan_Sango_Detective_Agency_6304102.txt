Traveler: Tell me about the Bantan Sango Detective Agency...
Sango: As the name suggests, it's a detective agency that helps people figure out the truth behind cases.
Sango: Be it murder, banditry, extramarital affair investigations, or pet searches... We can handle any trouble you may have, and I'm not making empty promises here.
Sango: Of course, the fees related to our services aren't going to be cheap. So it's best to have the payment ready before coming here.
Sango: Let me think. What else do I have to say... Oh, right. I also have a word of advice for you...
Sango: Emotion is the enemy of truth, and conscience the burden of knowledge. If you aren't ready to handle the truth, do not cross the threshold of wisdom lightly.
