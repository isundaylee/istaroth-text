# Old Friends, New Game


## Talk 1

Haniyyah: Golden Comet and Silver Companion... We meet again.
Haniyyah: As spirited as ever, I see!
Traveler: You look quite spry yourself.
Paimon: H—Haniyyah! And Balfour, too!
Paimon: Fancy running into both of you here!
Paimon: Well, back to the point, then. What are the two of you doing here? If Paimon still remembers correctly, this was where we could get those Floral Jellies...
Balfour: Ah, our two great heroes! Your voices alone swell my confidence greatly.
Balfour: Well then, I shall proceed to give my report on the results of our work.
Balfour: Previously, the two of you declared that the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament should be suspended for a time while the Akademiya improves the design of the Wisdom Orb.
Balfour: I believe the two of you are still waiting for notice concerning that?
Paimon: Yeah, that's right! Layla, Cyno, or the researchers responsible should inform us if there's any progress, right?
Traveler: Not that you'd understand the technical jargon much.
Paimon: Well, that's kinda how it is. We wouldn't be much help. We'd probably hinder them, really...
Balfour: Ah, how meticulous, how forbearing of you. I, for one, practically brim over with excitement when I consider the grand scenes from the previous tournament...
Balfour: So, I attempted to ask some of the related Akademiya staff recently to get some details—
Balfour: At present, improvements to the Wisdom Orb are still being put through their theoretical stages. In other words, any practical production will take some time yet.
Balfour: However, the once-heated discussions around the first iteration of the event are decreasing by the day, and the tournament itself is being forgotten, even if slowly. We cannot allow the influence of the previous event to be wasted.
Balfour: As such, I've teamed up with Ms. Haniyyah here to organize a "thematic event."
Traveler: What does "thematic event" mean, exactly?
Paimon: Is that what these Fungus-shaped pieces on the table are for?
Haniyyah: That's right.
Haniyyah: Mr. Balfour has been looking for sponsors as part of organizing the next tournament, and he has even sought to learn some marketing skills from Liyue.
Haniyyah: While doing that, he encountered a certain game known as Theater Mechanicus.
Haniyyah: Subsequently, he bought the Sumeru franchising rights for that game, and put together an all-new game with me as a consultant.
Haniyyah: We call it "Fungus Mechanicus."
Paimon: Fungus Mechanicus, huh?
Paimon: Let Paimon guess... So are we gonna take command of various shrooms to duke it out with some machines?
Balfour: Haha! You are indeed insightful, Silver Companion. Got it in one!
Balfour: It is my belief that this game is easy to understand and promote, and has great potential that is worth exploring.
Balfour: If we can successfully market it as a spin-off to the Beast Tamers Tournament, we can allow the latter to stick in people's minds in the long term.
Balfour: That way, the next tournament we hold will attract a larger audience and a larger pool of contestants.
Balfour: Of course, this can only go ahead with your permission. After all, you have the final say on how the tournament will be organized.
Traveler: I think it's worth a shot.
Paimon: #Hmm, well, neither {NICKNAME} nor Paimon really know all that much about doing business, but Paimon thinks you've got a good point there, Balfour!
Paimon: You and Haniyyah have been working on this together, and Paimon believes in the two of you, so go right ahead!
Paimon: We haven't played the game yet, but Paimon bets that loads of people will love it!
Balfour: Wonderful! Since the two of you have agreed, I can go ahead and promote Fungus Mechanicus.
Balfour: The game is in its testing stages at the moment, so we still need to invite people to play-test it and collect their feedback so that we can make further improvements.
Balfour: And I'm sure that you, who've surely encountered all manner of popular games throughout Teyvat, will come up with the best suggestions of them all!
Paimon: #Let's do it, {NICKNAME}! This is one of your strongest points, after all!
Traveler: Why do I get the feeling that you're commanding me to...
Paimon: Hehe! But before that, Paimon's got a question for you, Haniyyah...
Haniyyah: Do you mean to ask about Bongo-Head and the others?
Paimon: That's right! Paimon misses our shroom buddies. How are they doing?
Haniyyah: Don't you worry, they're doing great — and living carefree as can be, too.
Haniyyah: Twirly-Whirly and Blitzara are currently staying at my <color=#00E1FFFF>temporary residence in northern Port Ormos</color>. One of the previous contestants is taking care of them.
Haniyyah: Bongo-Head and Kindlejoy are nearby. If you'd like, Silver Companion, you can go play with them.
Paimon: #Nearby, you say! Well then, {NICKNAME}, Paimon will go look for Bongo-Head while you play-test later, alright?
Traveler: Off you go, off you go!
Balfour: Well then, let's not lose any time. Come, Golden Comet, the early test build of Fungus Mechanicus is ready for you!
Traveler: I'll join you shortly.
Traveler: Alright! Golden Comet's about to strike!
Traveler: You've really worked hard on this, haven't you?
Traveler: Not that I'd have a lot of suggestions for them.
Traveler: Who are you again?
Paimon: #Oh, come on, {NICKNAME}, what are you on about?
Paimon: We took part in the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament, didn't we? It was great fun hanging out with our shroom buddies!
Paimon: We met Haniyyah then, and Balfour was the previous event's most responsible staff member.
Paimon: Wait, have you forgotten Bongo-Head and Twirly-Whirly too?
Traveler: Ooh, I remember now!
Paimon: What? C'mon! Paimon was about to fetch a doctor or something!
Traveler: Heh, I was just pullin' your leg.

## Talk 2

Balfour: Well then, let's not lose any time. Come, Golden Comet, the internal test build of Fungus Mechanicus is ready for you!

## Talk 3

Balfour: How was it, Golden Comet? How did your first taste of Fungus Mechanicus gameplay go?
Haniyyah: Judging by your expression, I suppose you haven't come to a conclusion yet.
Traveler: I only went for one round, after all.
Balfour: That is true. With this little test content, it is indeed rather difficult to judge the strengths and flaws of Fungus Mechanicus.
Balfour: Don't you worry. Ms. Haniyyah and I will be here for a while, and we'll have one new Mechanicus stage for you every day — seven in total.
Balfour: Come over whenever you have the time, and you'll get the opportunity to test those stages!
Balfour: Although you are the overall overseer in these matters, this game was something that Ms. Haniyyah and I came up with of our own accord — so this is an expenditure of time that lies outside your plans.
Balfour: As such, a fee will be provided to you for services rendered!
Traveler: Haha, well, I won't say no to that.
Balfour: Haha, very straightforward! I like it!
Haniyyah: I've applied for the two Fungi to be furnished with sufficient residence privileges, so they'll be here in Port Ormos throughout Fungus Mechanicus's testing phase.
Haniyyah: Your Silver Companion can spend more time with Bongo-Head, too.
Traveler: Good for Paimon!
Haniyyah: Hehe, yes, you should go see Bongo-Head as well. It misses you, you know?
Haniyyah: Bring this with you. You can feed Bongo-Head and Kindlejoy with it — it's their favorite.
Traveler: I can't wait either!
Traveler: You'll see that Mora back next time we run this tournament!
Traveler: I'll need to conduct further testing.

## Talk 4

Paimon: C'mon, Bongo-Head, let's play a clapping game!
Paimon: C'mon, Kindlejoy, let's dance with Bongo-Head!
Paimon: Hmm... We've gotten pretty familiar with Kindlejoy, but we still can't quite communicate as well with it as we can with Bongo-Head...
Traveler: You're a real happy bean, eh, Paimon?
Paimon: #You're here, {NICKNAME}!
Paimon: How are things going with the Fungus Mechanicus trials?
Traveler: The test period will still be on for a while yet.
Paimon: Ooh, so Haniyyah and our shroom buddies will be here for a while, huh? That's great!
Paimon: Paimon was planning to ask you to stay here for a day more so that we could spend more quality time with the Fungi.
Paimon: But it looks like we can hit two birds with one stone — testing Fungus Mechanicus and playing with our shroom buddies at the same time!
Black Screen Text: You have a good, carefree time with Paimon, Bongo-Head, and Kindlejoy, and feed the Marvelous Jellies to them.
Paimon and your shroom buddies enjoy themselves very much.
Paimon: Hehe, that was great, like Paimon's worries have all flown away!
Paimon: Well, Bongo-Head, Kindlejoy... See you tomorrow!
Bongo-Head: ♪~
Pyro-1: ?
Traveler: We can play with them every day before it concludes.
Traveler: I'm enjoying this, too.
