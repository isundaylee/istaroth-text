Traveler: Who are you?
Goth: I'm Ludwig, but all my friends in the city call me "Goth."
Goth: Goth is my family name. The Goth family has a long, proud heritage serving the people of Mondstadt.
Goth: From the Dawn Breeze Inn to the latest and greatest addition, the Goth Grand Hotel, the Goth family have been involved in the hotel and catering industry serving personal and business guests right from the start.
Goth: We might not be as illustrious as the Gunnhildr family, who defend Mondstadt against invasion, but even so each member of the Goth family is proud of the work we do.
