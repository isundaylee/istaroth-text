Qingbai: Hey there! Can I interest you in some of Liyue's finest porcelain? Everything you see here comes straight from the Scent of Spring kiln, so quality is guaranteed!
Qingbai: I'm about to close, so I can give you a nice little discount too. It's a clearance sale, I just need to make enough for the journey home.

Traveler: You're closing for good?
Qingbai: That's right. Last day today. Business hasn't been great, haha...
Qingbai: But don't mind me. If you concern yourself with anything, it should be these low prices! No prices lower than clearance prices.
Qingbai: On the fence? Take it home tonight and see how it looks with the other decor — if you like it, come and see me again tomorrow...

Traveler: Tell me about Scent of Spring.
Qingbai: It's the top pottery workshop in Liyue. They're experts in every part of their craft, from shaping the clay, to firing in the kiln, to glazing the finished product...
Qingbai: ...Only thing is, that shopkeeper of theirs has a certain way with words that tends to make the mind wander...
Qingbai: But not me, of course. Straight-laced guy like me? Nothing but pure thoughts.
Traveler: I thought today was your last day...
Qingbai: I, uh... I was just trying to accommodate you. Don't want you missing out now, do we?
Qingbai: If you like the store, I'll keep it open forever, just for you. How 'bout that?

Traveler: Goodbye.
Qingbai: You sure? Everything must go! One last look?
