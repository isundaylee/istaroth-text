# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Stammer?
Sansa: I'm practicing for my first-ever performance. But I'm so nervous!
Sansa: I can speak fine normally. But as soon as I'm aware that I'm performing, I get all tense and tongue-tied...
Sansa: But I've always dreamed of doing this. I've gotta keep trying!
Traveler: Tell me more about your dream.
Sansa: My parents were extremely resistant to the idea of me being a bard. They said there'd be no job security whatsoever...
Sansa: They were hoping I might be an academic, but my research skills are dire...
Sansa: Those were the days when they'd lock me in my room and force me to study. The only joy I got was from hearing the bards sing outside the window.
Sansa: That got me interested, and then after I grew up I just wanted to be a bard. Even if it meant falling out with my parents. I had to give it a try!
Sansa: This is the path I've chosen, and I'll find a way round any obstacles in my way... Even the stammer. I know I can do it!
