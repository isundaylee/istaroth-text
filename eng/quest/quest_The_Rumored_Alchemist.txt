# The Rumored Alchemist


## Talk 1

Paimon: Sucrose is a whole lot less nervous once she gets talking about alchemy and research, huh. Is that what all researchers are like?
Paimon: Anyway, let's go and look for Albedo.

## Talk 2

Sucrose: My apologies, I don't really know how else to describe him...
Sucrose: If I could sketch you his portrait I would, but my pencil strokes are no match for his.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Rosaria said there were elemental traces in the tracks. They should show up pretty clearly with Elemental Sight!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Paimon: Huh? Looks like Timaeus isn't here today...
Sucrose: (Hm? Wait, are these two...)
Sucrose: #Oh! Um... Hello, {NICKNAME} and Paimon. Pardon me, are you looking for Timaeus?
Paimon: No no! Just strange for him to not be around. Paimon always sees him standing here.
Sucrose: I see. He was called away by Albedo a little while ago. I was called over to attend to the store.
Sucrose: If you need any help, just call my name. If not, I'll... I'll be reading a book â€” over there.
Paimon: #Mm-hmm, thanks! No worries, we're all clued up on the basics of alchemy, aren't we, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: Mm-hmm, no need to trouble you.
Sucrose: I guess it's no surprise coming from the one who repelled Stormterror...
Sucrose: Actually, since it's you... I bet you're someone who'd be able to help Albedo.
Paimon: There's that name again: "Albedo." You and Timaeus mentioned him the last time we met, right? Is he also an alchemist in Mondstadt?
Traveler: Not a name I'm familiar with.
Sucrose: Apologies, I never introduced him. Albedo is the Knights of Favonius' Chief Alchemist. He's also Timaeus' and my teacher.
Paimon: But Paimon's only ever seen Timaeus teaching alchemy. So that means... Albedo is a teacher-teacher?
Sucrose: Yes, he's dedicated himself to investigating the truth of this world, and has made many an important breakthrough.
Sucrose: We often get alchemists coming to Mondstadt from all over Teyvat, seeking his help. They say that the subtlest of guidance from Mr. Albedo helps them to solve the most unfathomable of problems.
Paimon: Wow, Paimon didn't know he was such a big deal!
Sucrose: Mm-hmm. Still, it seems that he's encountered a problem in his research recently. Every time I see him, he has a concerned look on his face.
Traveler: I'm not sure someone as smart as him could use my help.
Sucrose: I'm sure that Albedo would love to hear about your incredible exploits. I know it would bring him lots of new inspiration.
Sucrose: Albedo is a true gentleman. He'll be sure to pay you back in equal measure for helping him out.
Traveler: Can he make me stronger?
Sucrose: I don't see why not. Testing the limits of living beings' capabilities is one of Albedo's areas of research after all.
Sucrose: Albedo and Timaeus will be conducting research in the mountains right now. I'd love to take you both to see him, but somebody has to attend to the store.
Sucrose: I'm afraid you'll have to go to the entrance to the pass and look for him by yourselves. Look out for a refined gentleman with the presence of a true scholar, and... umm...
Sucrose: ...Sorry, that's the best I can do. You'll have to do your best.
Paimon: Hey, stop worrying! We got this!
Traveler: Can he make Paimon stronger?
Paimon: Uhh, Paimon doesn't need any help in that department. But if Albedo wants to pay Paimon back for helping him, a few Mora might settle the score. Tee-hee!
Traveler: My knowledge of alchemy stops at basic crafting.
Traveler: Think I might have heard of him.
