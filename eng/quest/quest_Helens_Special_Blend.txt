# Helen's Special Blend


## Talk 1

Traveler: About those Sweet Flowers...
Helen: Oh, did you see the commission I put up? Finally, someone willing to help.
Helen: Have you gathered the ten Sweet Flowers?
Traveler: Here they are.
Traveler: Not yet.
Helen: Okay... Once you've gathered them all, could you pass them to me quickly? I fear that my throat's getting worse by the minute...

## Talk 2

Helen: Thank you so much. Please take this as thanks for your help.
Helen: I'll use them to brew some tea. Hopefully, that'll do my throat some good...
