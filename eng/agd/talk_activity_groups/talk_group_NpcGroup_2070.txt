## Talk

Tieshan: Greetings, Traveler.

## Talk

Traveler: Where's this?
Tieshan: Yuehai Pavilion. A landmark location in Yujing Terrace and also the place where the Qixing meet to discuss official matters.
Tieshan: Unless you are here on business, you would be well advised to stay out.

## Talk

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Tieshan: Rex Lapis... You know, I saw him once, in a crowd. He was disguised as a commoner, so nobody noticed. But I could tell from the way he carried himself — everything about him was so dignified and graceful.
Tieshan: How did I know it was him? To be honest, I can't know for sure...
Tieshan: But I believe that everyone in Liyue can recognize the one who founded our nation and watched over us for millennia, even if just by his silhouette.
Tieshan: I'm honestly still struggling to accept his death. Now I'll never know for sure whether it was really him...
Tieshan: We're not really supposed to discuss it to be honest. But if you can't get things off your chest... how can you expect to move on? *sigh* If anyone asks, though, we never had this conversation.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Tieshan: Farewell. While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail!

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me a bit about yourself...
Tieshan: My name is Tieshan. I'm a member of the Millelith, and I work to defend Liyue Harbor.
Tieshan: Well, actually, I'm not from the city. Qingxu Pool's where my home is, thereabouts.
Tieshan: Perhaps Rex Lapis has smiled upon my dutiful service, because after I heard the last round of divine predictions at the Rite of Descension...
Tieshan: ...I tried helping my family to do some business on the side, and what do you know — we actually had some small success.
Tieshan: Recently, I've moved my family property to Chihu Rock, so I suppose I do count as a citizen of Liyue Harbor now. *chuckles*

Tieshan: Still, I shouldn't tear myself up over it. The Rite of Parting went smoothly — and so may Rex Lapis' journey be.
