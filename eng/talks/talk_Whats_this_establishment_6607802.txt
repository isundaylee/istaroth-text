Traveler: What's this establishment?
Pakaa Nui: Xochicuicatl Records is the name! My cousin Haloa came up with it. Pretty romantic, if I should say so!
Pakaa Nui: As the name suggests, we sell music records at base, and we also provide production and distribution services.
Pakaa Nui: If anyone's written some music but can't get it from paper to record, we'll represent them, from production to publishing.
Pakaa Nui: See that over there? That's a collection of classics by a famous writer of kids' songs. One of our bestsellers!
