Traveler: Let's hear it for the "Tanuki of the Chinju Forest."
Saimon Eri: Tanuki are mischievous little fellows.
Saimon Eri: That remains true for the tanuki of the Chinju Forest. They're not evil monsters, but they do enjoy playing tricks on people.
Saimon Eri: Saiguu noticed this and began matching wits with the tanuki. She came out on top, of course, leaving them razzled and dazzled, stumped and stymied on many an occasion.
Saimon Eri: After Saiguu mysteriously disappeared, the tanuki grew bored, having lost their competitor and playmate, and turned to pulling pranks on villagers who pass by.
Saimon Eri: Do be careful if a pretty little house, delicious food, or golden Mora ever suddenly appear before you while you're in the mountain forest.
Saimon Eri: Because before you know it, the treasures would've become dirt, and ah! You'd realize that you've fallen for their tanuki tricks all too late...
