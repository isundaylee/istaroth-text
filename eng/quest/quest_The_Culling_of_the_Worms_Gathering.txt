# The Culling of the Worms: Gathering

Vinayak: Oh... thank you, brave Traveler!
Vinayak: Oh, phew! It hasn't been too long and the parts are still in good condition... Just a few more adjustments...
Black Screen Text: Vinayak starts tinkering with the machinery...
Shriya: ...Vinayak?
Vinayak: Almost done... I'm almost done!
Shriya: Vi-na-yak!
Vinayak: Whoa! Shriya? When did you get here?
Traveler: When you were fiddling with the components...
Vinayak: Didn't you say that this place was dangerous and full of monsters? Why are you even here?
Shriya: ...I'm just worried about our components. If we can't finish this assignment, even I can't return to the Akademiya!
Vinayak: Ha, I knew it. Look, I have everything here. Once we go back and make some more adjustments, we can finally start assembling.
Paimon: So, what are all these components for?
Vinayak: Ah, I forgot to tell you. They're for the Wenutslayer Cannon, our graduation project.
Paimon: Why such an obscure topic?
Vinayak: If you'd applied for graduation, you'd understand why... Well, not that any of this matters now.
Shriya: Allow me to formally introduce myself. I am Shriya, an Amurta graduate with a specialization in desert biology and ecology.
Shriya: This machine-obsessed doofus over here is a Kshahrewar researcher with a specialization in applied mechanics.
Vinayak: ...I'm Vinayak. Thanks a lot for earlier.
Paimon: Can people with completely different fields of study... work together?
Shriya: Don't get me started... Working with him on our graduation proposal was definitely the biggest mistake I've ever made as a student...
Vinayak: You can't really say that. We both managed to graduate in the end anyway.
Shriya: We did, yes, but did you forget how many extra years it took?
Vinayak: Whatever the case, we graduated, right? I heard some of our classmates just completed their thesis proposal last year.
Shriya: Ugh... enough! We're not students anymore, so can we just move on from these pointless discussions?
Vinayak: You're the one who always starts it...
Shriya: Nonsense! When we were building the first prototype...
Traveler: Hey, hey!
Paimon: Wow... you guys have it out for each other. How could the Akademiya even think of sending you two together to handle this...
Shriya: *sigh* Actually, the Akademiya didn't send us... A person named Kunar was supposed to take care of this matter.
Shriya: You could call him my mentor's mentor... He was there during our thesis defense.
Shriya: I guess that was how he got the impression that "some young students in the Akademiya had designed a Wenutslayer Cannon," or something like that.
Shriya: So this time, he simply kicked the two of us back here to deal with the problem, saying that "the Akademiya needs to give youngsters more opportunities to shine!"
Shriya: But he obviously didn't consider the fact that the two of us have barely talked to each other since graduation...
Vinayak: He even convinced my mentor... Ahem, anyway, this is an opportunity for me to get the Wenutslayer Cannon back out in the open!
Vinayak: Once it's assembled, we'll show those vermin what it can do!
Shriya: There that mechanical idiot goes again... From my point of view, I also want to investigate the cause of the Wenut rampage to maintain the ecological balance of the desert.
Shriya: #{M#Mr.}{F#Ms.} Adventurer, you look like someone of impressive skill. May I ask you to keep us safe while we're in the desert?
Traveler: I'll do it for the right price.
Shriya: Rest assured. There isn't a lot of support from the Akademiya, but at least we're well-funded. ...Although someone here has spent most of it on upgrading the machinery.
Vinayak: Thâ€”The improvements were necessary! ...And since you're capable of speaking politely, can't you be a little nicer to me?
Shriya: That depends on whether the person I'm talking to is worthy of my patience!
Paimon: Oh no... here they go again...
Traveler: Maybe leave the arguing for later?
Shriya: *sigh* Sorry... It's an old habit from my Akademiya days...
Shriya: This batch of components has to be brought back to Aaru Village for further adjustment. By all accounts, we can't start assembling until tomorrow.
Shriya: We had previously planned to install the Wenutslayer Cannon in nearby areas where Wenut have been spotted.
Shriya: When the time comes, there may be other creatures attracted by the noise we make. We'll be counting on you.
Traveler: No problem.
Vinayak: We can continue our debate now, right? I'm telling you, all my expenses are justified.
Shriya: You...! Fine, you asked for it. Let's go over the details and see where all that Mora went!
Traveler: See you tomorrow.
Traveler: Can we start with the actual work?
Traveler: It'll be a walk in a park for me.
Traveler: Arguing isn't gonna get you anywhere.
