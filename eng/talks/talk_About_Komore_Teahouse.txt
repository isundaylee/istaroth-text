Traveler: About Komore Teahouse...
Nakanishi: It's hard to find a classy tea house in Inazuma nowadays. Indeed, only when those who understand real culture gather together can we maintain the serenity of this place.
Nakanishi: I heard from Kozue that you were invited by the Kamisato Clan to Komore Teahouse. If Kozue is around, you can feel free to relax here.
