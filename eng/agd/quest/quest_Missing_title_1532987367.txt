## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Timmie: I won, I won!
Traveler: Congratulations, Timmie!
Timmie: Thanks. I can't wait to tell my mom... this'll make her really happy, won't it?
Timmie: Mom was the one who kept telling me I should join the tournament, so I'm gonna give the prizes to her!
Timmie: I really wish my dad could see me now...
Traveler: Bye, Timmie.
Timmie: Bye! Ah, Genius Invokation is sooo much fun...

### Additional Talk 2

Mika: Wait, why's everyone leaving? ...Did I miss it...?
Huffman: Ah Mika, too bad you weren't here to see it. I'm afraid that... Captain Kaeya lost.
Mika: What!?
Mika: Tell me everything! What happened?
Huffman: Well, I don't know much about Genius Invokation myself, but I did try to follow along by listening in to what everyone was saying...
Huffman: Captain Kaeya took out one of Timmie's character cards right at the start, giving him an early advantage.
Huffman: But I guess that was all part of his opponent's strategy...? In any case, Timmie spent the first few rounds stocking up cards in his hand, and then swung the game with a brutal offensive right at the end.
Huffman: Hmm, but y'know, maybe the match was already over from the moment they flipped the coin and determined that Kaeya would go second...
Huffman: *sigh* I need a drink...
Mika: Calm down, bro. Now's not the time to start drinking your sorrows away.
Mika: Knowing Captain Kaeya, he wouldn't want to see you upset over his loss.
Mika: Hey, why don't we learn how to play, too? Maybe then, we'll get to play against Captain Kaeya some day! Hehe... Though, I'm sure we'd lose pretty badly to him.
Huffman: Hah, yeah, you're right, Mika. Not a bad plan.

### Additional Talk 3

Kaeya: Hey there. Something else you wanted to discuss?
Traveler: About Genius Invokation TCG...
Kaeya: The game's really caught on lately. It's a part of everyday life now â€” everywhere you go, you see people playing it.
Kaeya: In fact, some people have even given up drinking in order to keep a clear head during the game.
Kaeya: Hehe, I'm sure Diona will be happy to hear that.
Traveler: How are the Knights of Favonius holding up?
Kaeya: Don't worry, everyone's just fine.
Kaeya: I actually managed to convince Jean to join me for a game, but we only got part of the way through before she was called away. I ended up having to finish the match for the two of us. *sigh* What can you do? Everyone has to put their work first.
Kaeya: But seeing how successful the tournament has turned out and how much fun everyone's had, I'm hoping that she at least has one less thing to worry about.
Traveler: Let's catch up another time.
Kaeya: Sure. We should have a game of Genius Invokation TCG when you get the chance.

### Additional Talk 4

Eichendorff: What an amazing tournament. That Timmie, huh... He really has a gift for this.
Lennard: Yeah, who saw that coming... But at least I can feel a little better about losing to him now.

### Additional Talk 5

Charlotte: "City on the Lake Teems With Talent in TCG Tournament as Young Prodigy Bests Favonian Cavalry Captain"...
Charlotte: Hmm, this title saves face for the Knights, but lacks a little "oomph"...
Charlotte: "Top Strategic Mind of the Knights of Favonius Outsmarted by Bridge Boy in Five-Round Failure"...
Charlotte: "Captain's Championship Hopes Crushed in Dazzling Dark Horse Defeat"...
Charlotte: Hmm... Maybe I should stick with my first draft...?

### Additional Talk 6

Hu Tao: By the way, does Captain Beidou play Genius Invokation TCG, by any chance?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes. In fact, she's one of the best in the whole Crux Fleet.
Hu Tao: Would you mind putting in a word for me, Kazuha? I'm a long-time fan of Captain Beidou's. I've always hoped I'll get to make friends with her some day, but so far I've never had the chance.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Sure. But please be gentle when you inevitably defeat her in Genius Invokation.

### Additional Talk 7

Ningguang: I've heard that even the unofficial Genius Invokation tournament is enjoying a huge turnout. Many serious TCG players have registered for both the official and unofficial ones.
Ningguang: As for me... I don't mind trying my hand at the trending games from time to time, though I still prefer chess.
Ningguang: But when it comes down to it, whatever differences there may be between the various games around, they all share one important thing in common: They bring friends together.

### Additional Talk 8

Charlotte: Hi there, my name's Charlotte. I'm a reporter for The Steambird.
Charlotte: Could I borrow a moment of your time for a brief interview?
Brother Qian: *sigh* Sure, go ahead.
Charlotte: You made a promising start in this competition, leaving many contenders in the dust on your way to the finals, before narrowly missing out on a championship win when you lost to Director Hu Tao of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. It must be difficult for you, knowing how close you came to victory.
Charlotte: With this in mind, would you like to share your thoughts on how the final match played out?
Brother Qian: Uhh...
Brother Qian: Sorry, do you want an answer for the media, or do you want my actual thoughts?
Charlotte: I'd like to hear your actual thoughts, of course.
Brother Qian: *sigh*
Brother Qian: Well, I've always said that playing cards is seventy percent skill and thirty percent luck... But when your opponent rolls six dice of the same element at once, there's no coming back from that, not even with adeptus-level skills... so there was no hope for a mere adventurer like me.

### Additional Talk 9

Arataki Itto: Whew, that match between fox lady and fish lady really got my blood racing! The sweat's practically boiling off my forehead!
Kuki Shinobu: Yes, yes. I'm sure all of Ritou knows how excited you are, but the gang's all waiting for us. We should be heading back now.
Arataki Itto: Ehh, they can wait a little longer... At least let my compadre and I play one last match! You can't say no to that... Pretty please?
Traveler: Alright, let's play a match.
Arataki Itto: That's my compadre! I knew you'd be down to duel! Only you understand a hardcore TCG player like me!
Kuki Shinobu: Seriously, what will I do with you two...
Traveler: Maybe next time.
Arataki Itto: ...Fine.
Arataki Itto: It's okay, I don't blame you... But you should probably leave. You don't wanna see a grown oni cry...

### Additional Talk 10

Sangonomiya Kokomi: General Kujou, could I have a word with you?
Kujou Sara: Yes. Congratulations on your victory, Sangonomiya Kokomi.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I wanted to express my gratitude for the helpful advice you provided before the match.
Kujou Sara: It was nothing. Anyone with a good head on their shoulders knows that skill and strategy ultimately determine the winner. In any case, it was an exciting match to watch.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It was unfortunate that you didn't register for the tournament as well.
Kujou Sara: I'm afraid I'd be no match for you.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Don't say that. You're not so different from me... seeking chances to hone your skills in the game, considering countermeasures, and competing with others as if they're friends.
Kujou Sara: ...Perhaps you have a point.
Kujou Sara: In that case, let's play a match of Genius Invokation before you depart from Narukami Island.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It would be my pleasure.

### Additional Talk 11

Charlotte: I heard you refer to the opponent as a "kitsune youkai" earlier, could you tell me a little more about that?
Charlotte: Don't leave out any details. Who knows, maybe there's something I'll be able to use in my news piece.
Kirara: Oh! I'd better not, I'm afraid of saying something wrong. Besides, I'm not really the most qualified youkai to answer questions.
Charlotte: Okay, then maybe you could help explain why a kitsune would have any interest in Fried Tofu.
Kirara: Ah, now your questions are making me hungry.
Kirara: Why don't I just take you to try some Kitsune Ramen here in Inazuma? I can explain while we eat.
