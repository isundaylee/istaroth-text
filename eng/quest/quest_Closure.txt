# Closure


## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Chevreuse: You can leave the rest of this to me â€” the other Gardes will be joining me shortly. Don't worry, they won't have another chance to escape.
Traveler: There are still a few things I'm curious about...
Chevreuse: Hmm... The materials have many other regular uses outside of being used to make Imitation Sinthe, so they're not immediately subject to being confiscated or destroyed.
Chevreuse: The harbor would usually just seize them for some time while the customs paperwork is filled out and approved. If approved, they'd be let through, and if not, they'd be returned to sender. Elodie probably used her position to replace a portion of the shipment with something else before sending the whole shipment back to sender.
Chevreuse: Given that the foreign merchants who sent in the shipments were probably working with her in the first place, they likely just never reported the difference in what they sent and what they received.
Chevreuse: We will, of course, continue to investigate the rest of the details of this case. Now that we've caught Elodie, figuring out the whole scheme should just be a matter of time.
Traveler: How did Elodie get her hands on the raw materials?

### Additional Talk 2

Lyney: Lynette must have spent a record-breaking amount of time in serious mode today. I can't remember the last time I've seen her like that... Could it be because of a special someone?
Traveler: There are still a few things I'm curious about...
Lyney: Hmm... Based on information that we found before, Imitation Sinthe was first circulated on a small scale in Fontaine, before becoming a large-scale smuggling scheme.
Lyney: I'd assume that the first offerings of Imitation Sinthe came from what Pierre made in his early days. But since he was not experienced with running a clandestine operation, he was soon discovered by Garde Elodie.
Lyney: Elodie saw the opportunity to make a great profit in his work and perhaps even the chance of making a new life for herself, so she decided to cover his tracks...
Lyney: She started writing to him in Bernard's name, using what evidence she had compiled and the promise of enormous profits to blackmail him into cooperating with her.
Lyney: Unfortunately for her, she ran into Lynette. Even though my sister doesn't like to focus too much on a regular day, "serious mode" Lynette is one of the most perceptive people I've ever known.
Lyney: ...Still, all of that thinking really saps her energy. I need to go give some statements on her behalf, so I'll leave the recharging to you.
Traveler: How did Pierre get recruited into the scheme?
