# The Story Begins in a Forest Without Rain


## Talk 1

Paimon: Huh? Seems like we were just sent a strange book. It does have a really nice cover, though...
Paimon: Paimon's really curious... Let's read it and see what it's about!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Uh... That meadow over there looks pretty strange.
Almond: That's what the Calligraphy Tavern looks like, now it's lost all of its color...

## Talk 3

Nilou: We've got one final stop. Let's go.

## Talk 4

Almond: I've placed the bottle where you requested. The rest is up to you, my lady.

## Talk 5

Nilou: #Traveler, Paimon, we should make our way to the next location.

## Talk 6

Citrus: What flavor of Magic Tonic should I whip up first?

## Talk 7

Almond: This is the place. If you could just wait a moment, the Fairy should be—
Nilou (???): #...! Traveler, Paimon!
Paimon: Huh? Paimon knows that voice...
Nilou: ...It's really you! I'm so happy to see you!
Traveler: Yep... Same here...
Nilou: Ah! Sorry, sorry...
Paimon: So Nilou is the Forest Fairy? Well, you certainly look the part!
Traveler: Your outfit is lovely.
Nilou: Hehe, thank you! But to be honest, I'm still getting used to it...
Nilou: It's the weirdest thing. I remember I was reading a book at the Grand Bazaar, and then I guess I must have fallen asleep at some point, because... well, then I woke up dressed like this...
Nilou: And, in my dream, someone spoke to me. They said: "You are the Fairy of the Forest of Blessings. Now go, save the forest with your magic."
Nilou: At first, I thought this whole world was just part of the dream, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't seem to wake up. I couldn't find anyone I knew from the real world, either...
Paimon: Sounds similar to what happened with us! We also have no idea how we got here...
Nilou: Anyway, sorry for my reaction back there... I got a bit too excited when I saw you two...
Paimon: It's okay, we totally understand! We were looking for a way out, too. At least we know we're not alone!
Almond: Oh, blessed be the Goddess of Fate above, you're already friends with the Fairy of the Forest!
Nilou: Grandpa Almond, thank you so much for bringing my friends here. Could you let the others know I'm coming? I'll head over right away.
Almond: Of course, leave it to me!
Almond: Hey-ho, pistachio! Today truly is a blessed day.
Paimon: Wow, Nilou, looks like you made short work of getting to know the locals!
Nilou: Well... when I arrived here yesterday, Grandpa Almond told me all about the state of this world. Since they think of me as their Forest Fairy, I just felt like I had to try to help them.
Paimon: Ohh! So, you mean like... using some kind of Forest magic to repair the Tavern?
Nilou: Unfortunately, I don't know how to use the "magic" of this world. I've tried using my Vision, but it doesn't seem to work here...
Nilou: If the books stored in this hut are anything to go by, this seems to be the place where the Goddess of Creation first made the townspeople of this Forest.
Nilou: She folded the pages of books into small origami animals, gave them life with her magic, and with time, that's how the Forest of Blessings took shape.
Paimon: Hmm... Maybe one of the books here could teach us how to use magic?
Nilou: I read them all, but only found one reference to magic—
Nilou: "The incantation, 'Abracadabra,' means 'to create what I say.' This is a world made of words, where fantastical powers can be wielded by all."
Paimon: Okaayy... So, basically, everyone in this world can use magic? That's nice, but still kinda vague...
Nilou: Yeah, from the other books I read, it seems like this goddess really likes to play fast and loose with the details.
Paimon: So... what should we do now? Um, didn't you say you were going somewhere, Nilou?
Nilou: Oh, yes. I was going to help some of the other residents of the Forest. They've been busy making preparations to reopen the Tavern, so I thought I could help out.
Paimon: Got it! Guess we should just focus on what we can do for now.
Nilou: This whole thing is making me pretty nervous, actually... It's like I've been pushed on stage without being taught the choreography!
Nilou: Since I'm already wearing the costume, though, I might as well try to play the part. It's what a professional dancer would do.
Nilou: And, who knows, maybe I'll find my own magic along the way! All I can do is try, right?
Paimon: At least you're optimistic!
Traveler: We'll be there to cheer you on, too.
Nilou: Thank you! Then, let's go.
Traveler: It's perfect for you.
Traveler: Maybe... calm down a bit first...

## Talk 8

Chestnut: Look, the Forest Fairy is here! And she brought her companions! Grandpa Almond was right, they do look promising!
Nilou: Hello there, everyone. I heard you were working on the piping for the Calligraphy Tavern. Is there anything we can do to help?
Chestnut: Ah, we wouldn't dream of troubling you with our petty problems, my lady! Don't you worry, we have it all under control.
Paimon: You sure about that? Because from where Paimon's floating, the piping is looking pretty chaotic...
Chestnut: Ah, yes... we have my careless friend to thank for that. He promised we could leave the pipe-connecting to him, and... well, the results speak for themselves.
Ginkgo: Hey...! I just wanted to inspect each pipe! This is the network the Magic Tonic has to flow through. I was just trying to be thorough! So, I... I disassembled the whole thing...
Chestnut: Yeah, and now you've forgotten how to put the thing back together! *sigh* Have you been eating too many nuts again? 'Cause you are what you eat...
Nilou: Please, don't fight. I know everyone wants the Tavern to reopen as soon as possible so that the Forest can return to normal.
Nilou: So, why don't you let us help out?
Paimon: Yeah, we're here anyway, so we might as well be helpful! We just need to reassemble these pipes, right?
Chestnut: Well, if you're offering... Basically, the pipes need to be connected properly to allow the Magic Tonic to *flow through*. If you put the wrong pipe in the wrong place, the Tonic will get stuck halfway...
Ginkgo: Attention to detail is key.
Chestnut: Says the guy who messed the whole thing up in the first place!

## Talk 9

Ginkgo: Amazing! You did it!
Paimon: Now, the Tonic will flow into everyone's cups without getting stuck, right?
Paimon: Gotta say, though, Paimon is starting to get pretty curious about this Magic Tonic... Um, could she have a teeny tiny sip? Just a little taste! Please!
Traveler: Paimon...
Paimon: It's not greed! It's curiosity!
Chestnut: Well... if it's really just one sip, I guess that would be fine...
Ginkgo: Just... Be careful! This is one of the last cups left in the entire Forest! We're supposed to save it for our research!
Paimon: Just a sip, promise! Okay, here goes... Hmm...
Paimon: ...Ugh! What was that? It's sticking to Paimon's tongue! Wait, is this just regular *ink*?
Traveler: "Ink" and "paper," huh...
Nilou: Wait, does that mean... What the legend says is true?
Nilou: "The Goddess of Fate used ink to compose her stories on paper, and the Goddess of Creation used her power to bring those tales to life."
Paimon: No wonder the Tavern is so important to the Forest...
Nilou: Maybe the Fading Disorder occurs when the ink within the body dries up... That would explain why the beings here are forgetting their own stories...
Nilou: ...
Chestnut: I'm not sure I can really wrap my head around this conversation, but there's no need to get all worked up on our behalf, my lady. With the pipe installed, I'm sure the Tavern will be up and running in no time.
Ginkgo: What do you mean, can't wrap your head around it? The Fairy is recounting the story of how the Goddesses gave us life. In fact, I've seen the Goddess of Creation with my own eyes!
Nilou: Really?
Chestnut: Don't be ridiculous, there's no way you're old enough to have met her! We're the same age — and I think I would know, considering we went to tell our wishes to the Goddess of Fate together! So stop talking a load of paper mache.
Ginkgo: Fine... It was my grandfather, alright? He was the one that saw her.
Ginkgo: He said that one day, after he finished work, he saw the Goddess of Creation grant us life with his own eyes.
Ginkgo: In her hands, she held the very paper used to form our bodies. She whispered something into the pages... And then, suddenly, a paper frog was born, ready to leap into the world! Oh, it was spectacular!
Chestnut: Cut the theatrics, will you? You weren't even there...
Paimon: Wait, so... That's it? Paimon thought creation magic would have a little bit more... pizzazz.
Ginkgo: Oh! So, in your world, the creation of life is a much showier affair? I'm learning something new every day!
Paimon: Um... Well, that's not exactly what Paimon was trying to say...
Nilou: Magic... doesn't have to be spectacular...
Chestnut: That's enough out of you. All your boasting is confusing our kind Fairy!
Nilou: Oh, no, it's alright. I actually think I understand the magic of this world a bit better now. Thank you.
Ginkgo: The honor was all ours, my lady.
Traveler: Stop being greedy...

## Talk 10

Stream: Still no good...
Traveler: Let's keep trying!
Paimon: Yeah, don't give up just yet! Our rhythm was probably off. Let's give it a few more tries!
Traveler: Let's take a break.
Paimon: Sure, it's good to take a breather. We can come back to this later!

## Talk 11

Firecracker: Stream! Your rhythm is off again! At this rate, it doesn't even matter if the Tavern reopens. The band's not going to even get any gigs.
Stream: *sigh*... I'm sorry...
Nilou: Uh, hello there... I hope we aren't interrupting your rehearsal.
Paimon: Wait, these are the two frogs we saw on the road a little while ago!
Firecracker: Ah, the Forest Fairy is here! For the love of lotus leaves and dewdrops, Stream, you've really gotta put in some effort now!
Stream: But... I...
Nilou: Oh, don't pressure yourselves on my account! Are you rehearsing for a show?
Firecracker: Sure are! You see, our group regularly performs for guests at the Tavern.
Firecracker: We've been out of work for quite some time, with the closure and all. But, after hearing of the Fairy's arrival yesterday, we figured we needed to get in performance shape right away!
Nilou: Hehe, I understand how you feel! Back at the Grand Bazaar, Zubayr Theater's always busy with rehearsals too.
Firecracker: The Grand Bazaar? Do people there sing on lotus leaves as well?
Nilou: Yeah, they do, and it's a reaaaaaally big one! You're the conductor of your group, aren't you? You remind me of Mr. Zubayr!
Firecracker: Ah, then he must be an ambitious director, one who would do anything to avoid disappointing a single member of the audience. It's just...
Stream: ...
Nilou: Is there anything we can do to help you, Mr. Stream?
Stream: Oh, no, no, my problems are... mine and mine alone...
Stream: It's just... after the Tavern closed, I somehow forgot how to sing... I'm always a few beats behind everyone else, and I keep singing out of key...
Firecracker: You were our trump card, our best singer by a mile...
Stream: I know, I know... But... *sigh*
Paimon: So he is a victim of the Fading Disorder, too...
Nilou: Don't be sad, Mr. Stream! Whenever I've forgotten important dance steps in the past, my friends at the Grand Bazaar always stick by my side to encourage me!
Nilou: They smile, and patiently tell me everything's going to be okay. Then they play the melody for me over and over, until the steps finally come back to me... Now, it's our turn to help you.
Paimon: #We just need to help you remember how to sing, right? Traveler's got a great sense of rhythm. We can help keep you in time!
Firecracker: Well, what do you say, Stream? I think it's a great idea. Just focus on the lyrics, and the Fairy's friends will help you stay on beat.
Stream: Are... Are you sure? This is... really asking a lot...
Nilou: Don't worry about it, Mr. Stream. It'll all be worth it when the Tavern reopens and we finally have the chance to hear your marvelous singing voice.
Stream: Alright then... Thank you so much, everyone. I—I'll give it my best shot!

## Talk 12

Almond: My dear Citrus, please tell me you're joking. We can't have you out of commission with the Tavern about to reopen!
Citrus: I'm sorry, Grandpa Almond, it's the truth. I was just too excited for the reopening, and must've fallen asleep in an awkward position.
Paimon: Grandpa Almond! We're here to help!
Almond: Oh, hazelnuts on high, you could not have come at a better time! Please, allow me to introduce you. This is the bartender of the Calligraphy Tavern, Miss Citrus.
Traveler: She's so tall...
Almond: Miss Citrus is supposed to add all kinds of delicious fruits to the Magic Tonic. Her additions are what turn it into the finest brew in the land. She's indispensable to the operation of the Tavern!
Citrus: I appreciate the kind words, Grandpa Almond, but... Owww... My neck...
Nilou: Are you alright?
Citrus: Ah, terrible timing... getting a kink in my neck at a time like this...
Citrus: Could you give my tail a little twist? That should help free up the movement in my neck. I would do it myself, but I can't reach on my own, and Grandpa Almond is too old, and as light as a feather...
Paimon: The neck and tail... are connected?
Citrus: Of course they're connected! Just like how you can't have a rainbow without rain. Anyway, you just need to position me *at the right height* to pick the fruits, and then put them *in the barrel over there*.

## Talk 13

Citrus: Perfect! My neck feels much better.
Paimon: So there really is some kind of connection between your neck and tail...
Almond: Thank you so much, everyone! I can rest easy now, knowing the drinks at the Tavern will be just as wonderful as before.
Paimon: That's another problem solved!

## Talk 14

Stream: I feel like... I'm getting the hang of it again!
Firecracker: Goddesses above, this better stick when it comes to the performance! Just do it exactly like how we rehearsed!
Stream: Thank you, everyone... Thanks to you, my voice is once again as clear as a flowing stream!
Nilou: Glad to hear that you're feeling better, Mr. Stream. It's also about time for us to go to our next destination.
Paimon: Mhm! We'll be looking forward to your performance at the Tavern!

## Talk 15

Ginkgo: ...See, I was right! That's exactly what the Goddess of Creation did all those years ago!
Chestnut: Ugh, brag away. But, don't think you're getting out of carrying all those pipes with me later.

## Talk 16

Firecracker: For the sake of the Forest Fairy, Stream, please give me your best performance when we take the stage!
Stream: Rest easy, Firecracker. I've been waiting for this day for a very long time.

## Talk 17

Nilou: ...
Nilou: Phew...
Nilou: Forest... Please heed my words, and accept my blessings...
Nilou: May your spring of wondrous magic never run dry, and may all who call you their home lead happy, fulfilling lives...

## Talk 18

Paimon: Well, since we've taken care of most of the tasks, all we need to do now is reopen the Tavern!
Nilou: But, we still don't know how to use the magic of this world. We don't even know why the Tavern closed in the first place...
Paimon: Huh... Oh! What about the method that one hamster mentioned? You should try it, Nilou!
Nilou: You mean, the creation magic his grandfather saw outside the Hut of Blessings? Hmm, I wonder... How exactly did the Goddess of Creation give them life...?
Paimon: Maybe... you don't need to understand it, just give it a try! Everyone here calls you the Forest Fairy. Maybe you have the magic powers already, and you just don't know it!
Nilou: In other words... this Forest is a stage, and all I need to do is... step out into the spotlight? Hehe, sounds just like a fairytale!
Paimon: Well, we are surrounded by talking origami animals and magic potions, after all... Almost seems like anything's possible in this place.
Nilou: You're right, Paimon. We won't know anything unless we try. In that case... Let's see...
Black Screen Text: Nilou takes out a page from a book, and folds it into the shape of a hamster...
Nilou: This is how you do it, right? I think I got the folds right.
Paimon: Whoa! Your origami skills are great!
Nilou: I once saw one of our prop people make something similar. It looked really cool, so I took some time during my break to learn the basics. It's not a bad way to stave off sleepiness, either!
Paimon: Well, how do you feel? Sense any... uhh... magical powers flowing through you?
Nilou: ...
Nilou: ...No.
Paimon: No? Hmm... What are we missing?
Traveler: Aren't you supposed to say some magic words?
Nilou: Magic words? But, how am I supposed to know what the Goddess said to bring them to life?
Traveler: It doesn't matter what she said...
Paimon: Ooh, good point! You're the Forest Fairy, Nilou, what do you want to say to the new resident of your domain?
Nilou: ...
Black Screen Text: Nilou picks up the hamster, and kisses it gently on the forehead...
Nilou: "I bestow upon you the blessings of the forest, and offer you a home in this land..."
Nilou: "Your name shall be Padisarah. May you bloom in this world as beautifully as the flower I love."
Padisarah: ...
Padisarah: My name is... Padisarah.
Paimon: It worked! It actually worked!!
Almond: Well, peel my shell and call me a nut... I never imagined I'd witness such a miracle at my age. It's just like what the stories said about the Goddess of Creation!
Padisarah: Shell... miracle...?
Nilou: Nice to meet you, Padisarah. I'm Nilou, the Fairy of this Forest. From this day forward, this place is now your home.
Padisarah: Hello, Fairy Nilou!
Nilou: I hope you'll grow up happily in this Forest.
Padisarah: Grow up...
Almond: Hahaha, you can leave the little one with old Almond for now. Oho, this sure brings back memories... It's been such a long time since we last held a welcome ceremony.
Almond: Here, Padisarah. Come to Grandpa Almond.
Paimon: Well, now that Nilou has mastered the Goddess' magic, we should be able to reopen the Tavern, right?
Nilou: Hmm... Grandpa Almond, could you send a few people to check the underground space beneath the Tavern?
Almond: Oh, of course! May I ask why?
Nilou: The moment I used magic, I sensed something... strange down there. I have a feeling it's connected to why the Tavern had to close down.
Almond: Of course, we'll look into it right away.
Nilou: Make sure you listen to Grandpa Almond, Padisarah. Don't go running off on your own!
Padisarah: Padisarah... listen... running!
Almond: Hey, come back here, you! Wait!!
Paimon: Yup, that's Nilou's creation all right. She's got so much energy... Anyway, how did you manage it, Nilou?
Nilou: Well... All I did was say my wishes for her out loud. Maybe the magic is in the words, themselves, just like the book said!
Paimon: This place is seeming more like a fairytale by the second.
Nilou: I mean... we're somewhere called the Forest of Blessings, so it kind of makes sense.
Paimon: Well, anyway, Paimon thinks this magic suits you perfectly, Nilou!
Traveler: What about the space under the Tavern...
Nilou: ...When I brought Padisarah to life just now, I was able to sense the magic flowing through the Forest — in the flowers and trees, and inside the creatures that live here...
Nilou: But for some reason, there's a hollowed-out space beneath the Tavern where I couldn't sense anything at all...
Almond: We're back, my lady!
Paimon: That was fast!
Almond: You were right, there was something under the Tavern that I've never seen before! It looked transparent, and gave off a... clinking sound when I knocked on it.
Nilou: Transparent and clinking... Oh! I've got it!
Paimon: Uh, already!?
Nilou: Haha, you've got to use fairytale logic, Paimon.
Traveler: ...Is it an "ink bottle"?
Nilou: That's right! *An empty ink bottle*, to be exact. Still remember the taste of the "Magic Tonic" you took a sip of, Paimon?
Paimon: Yeah, it was... ink! Oh, Paimon gets it now.
Almond: You've lost old nuts-for-brains again, I'm afraid... But, no matter, is there anything else we can do to help?
Nilou: #Traveler, Paimon, will you come gather some ingredients with me? I learned what we need to make the Magic Tonic back in the Hut of Blessings.
Paimon: Sure thing! What do we need to get?
Nilou: Hmmm... "A setting sun that never sets," "a dragon that cannot fly," and "a moon that only shines at night."
Paimon: Huh!? Where are we supposed to find crazy things like that?
Traveler: She means sunsettias, snapdragons, and Nilotpala Lotuses.
Paimon: What? How did you get that so fast?
Traveler: "Fairytale logic," Paimon.
Paimon: Logic, huh? Lucky guess, more like...
Traveler: What had you so concerned?
Traveler: Focus on what you want to say.

## Talk 19

Nilou: Give me just a second. I'm gonna go fetch an ink bottle from the other room.
Paimon: Paimon doesn't get it... All the ingredients are super tasty, but, somehow, the final product turns into ink...
Paimon: Well, anyway, Paimon's not going anywhere near the stuff this time, not even if you bribed her...
Nilou: Sorry to keep you waiting.
Nilou: Let's see... According to the book, first you do this... then this... and then...
Nilou: ...It's done!
Paimon: Wow, magic sure makes everything super convenient!
Almond: Yes, this is it... This is exactly the Magic Tonic we need!
Nilou: Grandpa Almond, could you take the concoction to the room underneath the Tavern and place it next to the transparent bottle you found? I'll handle the rest.
Almond: Of course! As you command, so it shall be done!
Nilou: Phew... I still get nervous at times like this. It's just like when you step on stage, and you can tell that every single person's gaze is fixed right on you.
Traveler: Relax, Nilou.
Nilou: Hehe, thanks, you two! I can't tell you how great it is to have you by my side. Almost makes me feel like I've been blessed by the Goddess of Fate, too!
Nilou: Let's go. We shouldn't keep everyone waiting.
Traveler: We're right here with you!

## Talk 20

Almond: Yes, this is it... This is exactly the Magic Tonic we need!
Nilou: Grandpa Almond, could you take the concoction to the room underneath the Tavern and place it next to the transparent bottle you found? I'll handle the rest.
Almond: Of course! As you command, so it shall be done!
Nilou: Phew... I still get nervous at times like this. It's just like when you step on stage, and you can tell that every single person's gaze is fixed right on you.
Traveler: Relax, Nilou.
Nilou: Hehe, thanks, you two! I can't tell you how great it is to have you by my side. Almost makes me feel like I've been blessed by the Goddess of Fate, too!
Nilou: Let's go. We shouldn't keep everyone waiting.
Traveler: We're right here with you!

## Talk 21

Padisarah: Fairy Nilou is amazing!
Paimon: Wow, it's so pretty! What a beautiful Tavern!
Nilou: It matches the scenery of the Forest perfectly. I was so surprised when it suddenly opened up like that... Just like a pop-up book!
Almond: ...I remember now. I remember everything!
Almond: ...It was me. I was the one who went to the top of *Constellation Metropole*, and witnessed the Goddess's prophecy!
Almond: "The Hero who shall save this world will descend upon the Cliff of Prophecy. The Hero, supported by their companions, shall restore peace to this world."
Paimon: So the prophecy really did have all the answers, you just forgot the first half...
Almond: That's why I was waiting near the Cliff of Prophecy... Haha, wonderful, simply wonderful! There's still some hope left for old Almond after all!
Paimon: Is the Cliff of Prophecy that place with the huge mural? 'Cause that is where we woke up, but we don't remember anything about how we got there. Also, we didn't get a change of clothes like Nilou... Are we definitely the Heroes?
Almond: If not you, then who else? You've already helped the Fairy revitalize our Forest. To us, that makes you heroes, prophesized or not.
Paimon: Alright! Either way, we're going to keep adventuring, even if just to figure out how we can get back to our world.
Traveler: We can also help resolve any crises along the way.
Paimon: Yep, that's exactly right! Helping people we meet on the road is kind of our thing!
Almond: As expected, the words of the Goddess of Prophecy always come true.
Nilou: I'll come with you. It can't hurt to have a magical Fairy tag along, right?
Traveler: Thought you'd never ask!
Paimon: Heroes and fairies, dragons and new adventures... Heh, this is sounding more and more like a fairytale by the second!
Almond: Hmm, I would say your next stop should be Constellation Metropole. It's Simulanka's most prosperous city, just across the sea.
Almond: Once you've arrived at the Astral Garden at the highest point in the city, maybe you can try seeking divine counsel from the Goddess of Prophecy herself.
Padisarah: ...Are you leaving, Fairy Nilou?
Nilou: I'm afraid so. There are still other people who need my help. I won't go far, though, and I'll come back to visit the minute I have time to spare.
Nilou: So, be a good girl, Padisarah, and help out Grandpa Almond whenever you can, alright?
Padisarah: Mhm! Got it! Padisarah will wait here for you!
Almond: Hahaha, that's a good girl, Padisarah. Ah, I almost forgot — if Constellation Metropole is where you're heading, you'll need to take the Maritime Express.
Almond: I'll head to the station first thing tomorrow morning and wake up that lazy station master for you. Why don't you take a break for the rest of the day? You should savor the beautiful scenery of the Forest before you go.
Paimon: Sounds great! Paimon definitely feels tired after being on the go for so long. There's a spot in the Tavern with Paimon's name on it!
Citrus: Oh? Sounds like someone is ready to order!
Paimon: Oooh, well, if you're offering... Paimon will take a glass of Bulle Fruit Tonic! ...Um, but hold the Tonic, hehe!
Traveler: It would be our honor, my lady.
Traveler: We can also help resolve your dragon problem along the way.
Paimon: Yep! We've beaten up plenty of dragons already, so what's one more?
