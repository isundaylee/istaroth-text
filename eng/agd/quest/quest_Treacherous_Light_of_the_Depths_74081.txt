# Treacherous Light of the Depths


## Talk 1

Paimon: Whoa... Who knew there was such a huge space under the water, with strange devices too!
Paimon: Paimon doesn't have a clue what that device is for, but it looks like its been abandoned for a long time, and nobody's been here either...
Paimon: Let's be careful!

## Talk 2

Chisseray: Sure enough... Not doing research any more was the correct decision...
Traveler: About Punched Tape...
Chisseray: Punched Tape? Now? The Central Laboratory blew up again! Sorry, but before that's cleared up, I don't have any time to worry about that stuff...

## Talk 4

Paimon: Hello! About Ms. Sevigne...
Black Screen Text: You describe what happened to Chisseray and give her the three punched tapes...
Chisseray: I was just mulling over whether to go check up on her. So that's what happened. Thank you for the update... and for the punched tapes, too.
Chisseray: It's surprising that Maillardet's prototypes can still move, and that Sevigne is still working in such a dangerous environment. I'll talk to the administrative staff about arranging the recovery.
Chisseray: And see about the possibility of expensing it while I'm there... That was quite clever of her. It's up to the administrative staff whether or not to reimburse it in the end, but I'll pay it for the time being.
Chisseray: Anyway, thanks for your help. Here's your pay for a job well done.

## Talk 5

Sevigne (???): I almost thought Mr. Eastinghouse had come back, what with all the shaking and fighting noises... Turns out it was actually someone accidentally triggering the devices outside...
Sevigne (???): Oh no, Maillardet's prototypes... How did they end up like this?

## Talk 6

Paimon: Uh, did we... Did we just do something really bad?
Sevigne (???): That's quite odd, I felt a vibration earlier...
Traveler: I felt it too.
Paimon: Hmm, it could be because we messed with the device on the upper level...
Sevigne (???): The door here was locked before, right? And there were even some clockwork meka specially guarding it...
Traveler: I gave the guards a "break" and then opened the door.
Paimon: We... We didn't have a choice! They attacked us first, so it was legitimate self-defense!
Sevigne (???): Maillardet's prototypes... They should have been in standby mode. After all, even since he scored such a nice spot on Erinnyes, he hardly ever came back.
Sevigne (???): Now that I think about it, who would want to come back to this damp, dilapidated lab when you could show off your research to an adoring audience in a stunning place like the garden dance floor?
Sevigne (???): After Mr. Bossuet left his post, everyone was scattered throughout the institute, just like the materials here. Not even a couch was left behind.
Sevigne (???): There should only be prototypes here, waiting for those who will never return. Normally they'd just be standing here on standby, and that's no big deal. But now, oh, it's just great.
Sevigne (???): Take a look! They've been beaten so badly that most of the clockwork machinery has fallen out. If Maillardet found out...
Traveler: That was me. Sorry.
Paimon: Sorry... Is this prototype expensive? If we have to provide compensation...
Sevigne (???): Relax. I was going to say if Maillardet found out, he would definitely laugh out loud.
Sevigne (???): After all, usually it was him interrupting the dancing of the prototypes, and after he was beaten to the ground, he'd sit there laughing.
Sevigne: Oh, I've been talking so much yet I haven't introduced myself. I'm a researcher at the Fontaine Research Institute. You can call me Sevigne. And you two are...?
Paimon: #Paimon's Paimon, and he is Traveler. We're, uh...
Traveler: Just passing by, with no other intentions whatsoever.
Paimon: Yes! We're just passing by, and definitely didn't think there were any treasures in here so...
Sevigne: Oh, you mean like a ruins tour with treasure-hunting sessions? You're in the wrong place for that. This might seem like a ruin but... Well, actually, it is a ruin.
Sevigne: Though it's not on any lists of recommended ruins for tourists yet.
Paimon: Fine... Then we'll be leaving now...
Sevigne: ...Wait, you've heard of the new Fontaine Research Institute, right? If you're leaving, can you do me a favor and go there and find Chisseray...
Traveler: But we're not going there.
Sevigne: Then what am I going to do now? I've still got work to do, and Maillardet's prototypes were broken! I need someone to haul them back as soon as possible...
Paimon: #Hmm... Maybe we should help her out, Traveler...
Sevigne: Wonderful! Since you're willing to help me, I'll leave the recovery of the punched tapes to you, too.
Traveler: Had I known, I never would have touched those devices outside...
Sevigne: Don't say that. After all, it's just a piece of cake for you!
Sevigne: This way I can have the commission cost reimbursed as a research materials recovery expense.
Paimon: Really? You sure that's okay?
Sevigne: As it is indeed helping our research work, it is completely justified and legitimate. Of course it's okay!
Sevigne: If it's questionable, the request will be rejected by the administrative staff anyway. In which case I'll just cover the commission cost out of my own pocket.
Traveler: Do you often do things like this?
Sevigne: Not personally! I don't know about anyone else, but I've heard stories before... Never mind, it's not something outsiders would be interested in.
Sevigne: There are three punched tapes to recover. Or there should be only three of them on the shelf. They should be pretty easy to find. Thanks for doing this, you two.
Sevigne: Meanwhile, I have to check the prototypes again, since it's been a long time since they were last serviced... It won't be fun if they go haywire.
Paimon: All right, then we'll come back after we get the tapes.
Traveler: No problem. I got this.
Traveler: We've still got other treasure to find.
Traveler: Are there any treasures in here?
Traveler: Ever considered upgrading the strength of the prototypes?
Sevigne (???): Maillardet did do that. Maybe the final product will meet your expectations.
Traveler: Yeah! So weird, why's the door open now?
Traveler: Could it just be in your head?

## Talk 10

Paimon: These are the tapes we're supposed to recover, right?
Black Screen Text: You show the recovered punched tapes to Sevigne...
Sevigne: Yes, these are the ones! You guys are so efficient, not sloppy in the least!
Paimon: Something as easy as this? No way we're not finishing that in a jiffy!
Sevigne: That's still commendable. I'm not exaggerating when I say some of my colleagues could squander a whole day just to find one simple thing...
Sevigne: Though let's not speak of that now. Please bring the punched tapes back to Chisseray.
Sevigne: And tell her I won't be going back just yet. Oh, and let her know to get in touch with Maillardet and let him know he should recover the prototypes here ASAP.
Paimon: #Okay. So, Traveler, shall we go back the way we came?
Sevigne: Oh, that won't be necessary.
Sevigne: You two can dive, right? There is actually a waterway you can use. It was sealed to prevent accidental falls. I can open it back up.
Paimon: #That will be great! Let's take the waterway, Traveler!
Sevigne: The terminal to open it is inside. I can do that alone. You'll be fine getting out of here on your own, won't you? You won't get lost?
Paimon: #Of course, don't underestimate us! Paimon is the best guide in Teyvat. There's no way Traveler is getting lost with Paimon around!
Sevigne: Good. Thanks for delivering the message and the punched tapes for me. Hope you don't mind if I don't show you out.

## Talk 12

Paimon: There's a room here too? How mysterious... Maybe we actually stumbled into some weirdo's secret lab!

## Talk 13

Sevigne: The punched tapes should be on the bookshelves inside, so look for them there. As for the other research materials...
Sevigne: It should be okay to look, right? Not like they're classified or anything...

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Sevigne: The waterway isn't designed to be an actual route, but it should be safe. At least I never ran across anything dangerous the last few times I tried it.
