# Garland

A garland woven by Arama.
Garlands of this kind represent the blessings from all of Vanarana and once channeled endless powers during the fight with Marana's Avatar. But their blazing light has now faded, perhaps because they burned so relentlessly.

Every flower on the garland is connected with the lovely, tiny heart of an Aranara, and all of them together constitute the gate to Mahavanaranapna. Aranara will support those who wear such garlands. As friends, they ease the wearers' pains, ward off their nightmares, aid them through lightless days, and fill the emptiness in their hearts.
