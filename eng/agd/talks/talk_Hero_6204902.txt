Dugu Shuo: Hero...?
Dugu Shuo: Don't give me that look!
Dugu Shuo: You're giving me that look that says, "Who's this pint-sized pipsqueak half the height of his own sword telling me he's some sort of hero!" Don't even try to deny it.
Dugu Shuo: Hmph! With this sword from the blacksmith, I ain't scared of anyone!
Dugu Shuo: Once I get my Geo Vision, I'm gonna be the most legendary hero this world's ever seen!
Dugu Shuo: Why Geo?
Dugu Shuo: Do I really need to spell it out?
Dugu Shuo: With the power of Geo in my hands, I could conjure up a giant stone pillar beneath my feet!
Dugu Shuo: Then everyone would have to look up to me, mwuhahaha...
