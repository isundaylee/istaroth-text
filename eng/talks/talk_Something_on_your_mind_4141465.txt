Traveler: Something on your mind?
Marvin: I... I have a friend. Yes, a friend...
Marvin: He's very taken with a certain girl, but unfortunately, she doesn't come from a particularly wealthy family, so my friend's rather worried that his father will oppose their marriage.
Marvin: Thing is, he truly loves that girl and wants her to be his wife.
Marvin: So I... well, he, is wondering if he should simply come clean with his father...
Traveler: You sure you're talking about a friend?
Marvin: Ahem! *cough* Dâ€”Don't you say such scurrilous things...
Marvin: Wait a moment, you haven't been sent by the old man to test me, have you?
Marvin: Hmph, whatever. I said nothing. Just go.
Traveler: I don't think you should...
Marvin: Hmm, is that so...
Marvin: *cough* Ah, uh. I said nothing. You didn't hear anything from me!
