# Shadow of the Past


## Talk 1

Jean: ...Thank you for coming on such short notice, Honorary Knight. I know you must be busy.
Jean: Well, to make a long story short, there is a particular matter at hand that the Knights requires your assistance with.
Traveler: The Knights are busy as ever.
Jean: *sigh* Yes, it has been one thing after another recently. Neither myself nor any of the Mondstadt garrison are able to catch a moment of peace.
Jean: I have recently received multiple reports from the Knights of someone within the Lawrence Clan having close dealings with the Fatui.
Paimon: The Fatui! Again!?
Paimon: But who are the Lawrence Clan?
Jean: There was a dark period in Mondstadt's history when the aristocracy ruled over the city. The hard-won freedom that followed with the fall of Decarabian was lost once again, as slavery spread throughout the land.
Jean: The first Dandelion Knight, Vennessa, spearheaded the revolution that overthrew the old aristocratic system and established the Knights of Favonius, leading Mondstadt to become the city that you see today.
Jean: The aristocrats, that had oppressed the people of Mondstadt, were none other than the Lawrence Clan.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it. So the clan's descendants are now scheming with the bad guys to carry out more dubious deeds?
Jean: ...We suspect as much, though we have yet to obtain any solid evidence. The reason I summoned you here today is to ask you to help us further investigate this matter.
Traveler: But, why us?
Jean: *sigh* Unfortunately, the Knights of Favonius and the aristocracy have been at odds with one another for as long as I can remember.
Jean: We have already considered every possible way of resolving our differences, but it seems the descendants of the aristocracy remain antagonistic towards the Knights...
Jean: ...No matter what stance we take when dealing with them, the outcome is always the same... Our efforts only result in adding more fuel to the flames.
Jean: We could come knocking on their door on the grounds of a search warrant, but if the investigation were to come up empty, I'm afraid tensions and distrust would only increase.
Jean: All of our past efforts would have been wasted...
Traveler: But as the Honorary Knight, I technically also belong to the Knights...
Jean: You are in fact the best candidate to represent the Knights of Favonius.
Jean: But you need not emphasize your role as the Honorary Knight. You are a traveler from a distant land, and you can approach the aristocrats in this way.
Jean: Once you come to friendly terms with the Lawrence Clan, you should be in a good position to learn more of their possible connections with the Fatui.
Paimon: Whoa, leave it to Master Jean to come up with such a thorough plan.
Jean: Aha, perhaps such plans have become second nature after all the diplomatic issues I've dealt with.
Jean: The name of the Lawrence Clan member in question is Schubert. Lately, he can often be found strolling near the northern city walls.
Jean: It is said that he is difficult to get along with due to his temperamental disposition, but if we approach him calmly, then things should go off without a hitch.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Jean: Thanks again for your help. If you run into any snags along the way, I'll do anything in my power to support you.
Traveler: I hope things will go smoothly.
Traveler: Sounds like a job for the Knights of Favonius to me.
Traveler: Sounds like typical Master Jean to me.
Jean: I have been meaning to have a word with you if the occasion presented itself, but as you know, Mondstadt's safety must always be my first priority.

## Talk 2

Schubert: Huh? Who are you?
Paimon: Hello, we're here to...
Schubert: Hmph... "Hello"?
Traveler: Uh, hello...
Schubert: Did I hear you correctly? "Hello"?
Schubert: Hmph! And I suppose you think that you can simply strut up here and greet me in such an ignoble and vulgar manner?
Schubert: Given that I don't recognize you, I can only assume that you are a traveler of some variety. I'll have you know that you are speaking with the Schubert Lawrence, a blood descendant of the magnanimous nobility.
Schubert: If you wish to address me, you'd best consider your words more carefully. Such nonchalant manners are inadmissible and will never do.
Schubert: Now, if you're somehow capable of understanding anything I've said, then you will get down on your knees, apologize for your negligent actions, and give me a proper introduction. That is the appropriate etiquette!
Paimon: That's etiquette? Paimon's never heard of something so complicated before!
Schubert: Hmph, in former times when people knew their place and respected traditions, such conduct was only basic courtesy when greeting a nobleman.
Schubert: And neglecting your manners would result in a swift whipping.
Schubert: *sigh* But look at the world now, rules have been thrown to the wayside and manners forgotten. Ugh, I cannot bear to see such degradation.
Traveler: Sounds like too much hassle to me...
Schubert: What did you say? You dare question the dignity of the nobility?
Schubert: I'll have you know that though the Lawrence Clan is in decline, myself and others of noble blood are looking for a chance to restore our rightful honor.
Schubert: Just look around, the people are unruly and undisciplined! I, however, strive to retain the elegance and etiquette of the nobility. After all, we are of a completely different breed by birth.
Traveler: I haven't even said anything yet...
Schubert: Save your words, I find your manners and bearing repulsive. I have nothing to discuss with the likes of you.
Schubert: Besides, I am in no way obligated to instruct commoners on basic courtesies.
Schubert: Now, I have more pressing matters to attend to. I'll take my leave.
Traveler: It's no wonder the aristocracy fell.
Traveler: Yeah, what's wrong?
Schubert: "What's wrong"? Did you just say "what's wrong"?

## Talk 3

Amber: Well, if it isn't the Honorary Knight! I'm just on my way out to gather some intel. I didn't expect to run into you here!
Amber: Huh? Judging by your expression, you must have run into some trouble.
Paimon: Master Jean tasked us with a special assignment, but things seem to have run aground for the moment.
Traveler: It's a long story...
Amber: No need to get down on yourself, sometimes things just don't turn out as planned. Even I can't guarantee useful intel every time I'm dispatched.
Amber: You just have to keep at it and never give up!
Traveler: Thank you.
Amber: Hehe! Hey, why don't you let me try to help? What's the problem?
Paimon: Master Jean asked us to build a connection with someone named Schubert Lawrence.
Paimon: But it turns out that he's a peculiar character that doesn't listen to anyone... Especially Paimon.
Amber: Aha, Schubert, I know him! Let me guess, he said you didn't have any manners.
Traveler: So you heard...
Amber: Hehehe, I've been on the receiving end of his lectures many a time. The Lawrence clan can be very particular about such things.
Paimon: Uh... You mean everyone in the Lawrence Clan is just a big headache?
Amber: As aristocrats, they believe there should be a certain distance between themselves and common folk. *sigh* I understand their thinking, but that's just not how things are anymore.
Amber: However, there is one exception among the Lawrence Clan. My good buddy — Eula!
Paimon: B—Buddy?
Amber: That's right! Not only is she from the Lawrence Clan, but she's also Captain of the Knights of Favonius 4th Company.
Traveler: Jean told us that the Lawrence Clan sees the Knights as enemies.
Amber: Eula is special! She's not quite like the other members of her clan. She has her own beliefs and it shows.
Amber: In other words, she doesn't really adhere to the strict rules and conventions of her family.
Amber: However, she's still quite knowledgeable about dealing with the Lawrences. I'm sure you'll see what I mean if you meet her.
Paimon: Hmm, that's strange. If Eula is a member of the Lawrence Clan, then why would Master Jean choose us for the task? Couldn't she just ask Eula?
Amber: Ah, well... It's a little complicated. Basically, the Lawrence clan has frowned upon the fact that Eula joined the Knights, her family members don't particularly care for her...
Amber: In their eyes, Eula is nothing but a traitor to the family.
Traveler: She sounds like quite the character.
Amber: She's very easy to get along with. Just explain the situation and I'm sure she'll help you come up with a way to get along with Schubert.
Amber: In fact, I think she's out in the wilderness on patrol this morning. You should be able to find her around Stormbearer Mountains.
Paimon: Thanks, Amber! Alright, you heard her, let's go find Eula!
Amber: Good luck, you two! I've got my own matters to investigate!
Traveler: I guess that's understandable from their point of view...
Traveler: How could a member of the Lawrence Clan join the Knights?
Traveler: Sounds like you're no stranger to his rants...
Traveler: That's Amber for you.
Traveler: It wasn't our fault.

## Talk 4

Eula: You don't think twice before reaching for your sword, do you? Ugh... do you have any idea how long I've been tracking these targets?
Eula: ...And now you get to stake a claim. Hmph, you think you're stronger because you got to them first? Ugh... mark my words, vengeance will be mine!
Paimon: ...Uh, what?
Traveler: I'm sorry, vengeance?
Eula: That's right. I heard the commotion and came as swiftly as I could, only to find you two already fighting the Fatui. Not only that, you were making quick work of them, too!
Eula: If I didn't make my move, you would have been able to take all the credit!
Eula: Still, I'm glad you're unscathed. Confronting that number of Fatui at once can be dangerous.
Traveler: Actually, I'm quite used to fighting the Fatui.
Paimon: Uh... Sorry, Paimon doesn't understand what you mean... but thanks for your concern.
Eula: Concern? Why would I be concerned for the safety of my arch-enemies?
Paimon: "Arch-enemies"? Wait a minute! You were saying how glad you were that we were "unscathed" a second ago!
Eula: By which I meant, if you were injured, I'd have to escort two strangers guilty of stealing my targets all the way back to Mondstadt...
Eula: Which would mean you'd caused me even more trouble... my vengeance would be swifter still!
Paimon: Huh? So that's how you see all this!
Traveler: So you must be Eula?
Eula: Yes, that's me.
Paimon: Paimon thinks she's pretty strange... Although, at least we can communicate with her.
Eula: You dare to call someone you've just met "strange"? Forget the aristocracy, that's rude even by normal standards!
Eula: Speaking of which... how do you know my name?
Paimon: This is the Honorary Knight of the Knights of Favonius. And speaking of rude, we're trying to investigate an aristocrat named Schubert Lawrence.
Paimon: He's so obsessed with etiquette that he's not even willing to speak with us!
Eula: Hahaha! I understand now. That's my uncle alright.
Eula: But why do you mean to investigate him?
Traveler: He may be secretly involved with the Fatui.
Eula: I see... Haha, you have some nerve defaming a family member right in front of me. I will have vengeance for this, too!
Paimon: No, no, no! This is an assignment from Master Jean! It's just an investigation, that's all!
Traveler: Aren't you curious about your uncle?
Eula: To the everyday citizens of Mondstadt, everyone in the Lawrence clan is scum. It's natural for rumors and unwarranted gossip to lead to such suspicion.
Paimon: Hard to avoid such a reputation when you're known as the ruthless rulers of Old Mondstadt.
Eula: So that's what you think of me? Yet another transgression to avenge...
Paimon: But didn't you say it first!? Argh...
Eula: Hahaha, curious... We've only just met, and you've already given me three causes for vengeance. It's been a while since I've encountered anyone as interesting as you.
Traveler: Your definition of curious is... curious.
Eula: I assume you need me to teach you the conduct of the Lawrence clan. Only then will you finally be able to communicate with my uncle, correct?
Paimon: That's right, Amber told us to come and talk to you.
Eula: Well then, let's begin your training immediately. It'll be easier to train when we're back in Mondstadt, we'll require other people.
Traveler: But aren't you plotting vengeance against us?
Eula: We can put that aside for now. Besides, if it's the Acting Grand Master's assignment, and Amber's the one who recommended me, I should comply.
Traveler: You're not planning to take revenge at an opportune moment, are you?
Traveler: Why do you seem so happy about it?
Traveler: Aren't you worried about your uncle?
Traveler: I know my way around a fight.

## Talk 5

Jean: Schubert can be quite touchy, so it may not be easy to get along with him at first.
Jean: But as long as matters remain calm, then you should be able to come to friendly terms with him.

## Talk 6

Traveler: About Schubert...
Hertha: You mean that weird old aristocrat? I'm afraid I haven't seen him.
Hertha: Members of the Lawrence Clan don't usually appear in front of the Knights of Favonius of their own accord.
Hertha: Which is just as well. It would be a bother if it ended up affecting our logistical preparations.
Hertha: Head up and have a look. Who knows, you might just find him.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Hello, have you seen an aristocrat by the name of Schubert anywhere nearby?
Michelle: Hmm, the name doesn't ring a bell, but there has been an odd fellow strolling around here recently.
Michelle: He's always looking around, and sometimes he seems to stop to draw or note something down. To be honest, I've got no idea what he's up to.
Michelle: If that sounds like the person you're looking for, just head towards the city wall and you'll most likely run into him.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Amber: Head to the Stormbearer Mountains — you should be able to find Eula there!
Amber: She's a great friend of mine. She'll help you for sure.
