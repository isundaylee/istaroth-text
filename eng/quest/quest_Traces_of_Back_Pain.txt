# Traces of Back Pain


## Talk 1

Chalmet: Ow... Why is that box so heavy...
Traveler: Are you okay?
Chalmet: We meet again, Honorary Senior Researcher. I apologize... My... my lower back seems to have been injured, it hurts so badly...
Chalmet: I was planning to move a box over here and organize the materials inside.
Chalmet: I... I never imagined the box would be so heavy, and I couldn't quite keep my footing when I lifted it, so all the strain went straight to my waist...
Chalmet: Now I... It feels like my waist is broken, ow...
Traveler: Need me to carry you to a doctor?
Chalmet: No, no need... I've hurt my lower back before, I just need to rest a bit...
Paimon: Paimon wonders just how many files are inside, for it to be this heavy...
Chalmet: There must be... Well, a ton of files. After all, the Institute once promoted a style of work called "Document Everything" for some time.
Chalmet: Basically, it meant that absolutely a single thing at the Institute had to be physically documented.
Chalmet: After they began promoting this policy, the Institute's paper usage increased 5 times...
Chalmet: And because there were so many documents, every single office was forced to create a "document management" post just to categorize and sort all the documentation...
Paimon: So everything had to be written down? That sounds really annoying...
Chalmet: It was! Later, that style was slowly phased out, and only implemented to a limited extent.
Chalmet: But let's not discuss that now... Honorary Senior Researcher, can you help me handle the file box? Though my waist hurts, I still need to organize the files inside...
Traveler: Sure...
Traveler: You just recuperate.
Chalmet: No need to worry, I only need my hands to organize documents, I won't hurt my lower back further.
Traveler: I can call someone for you.

## Talk 2

Chalmet: Could I trouble you to bring me the file box on the *table to the left* just inside the door?
Chalmet: Thank you! It's really heavy, so be careful, and don't injure yourself... like me...

## Talk 3

Chalmet: Could I trouble you to bring me the file box on the *table to the right* just inside the door?
Chalmet: Thank you! It's really heavy, so be careful, don't injure yourself... like me...

## Talk 4

Chalmet: Well? Did you get me that box?

## Talk 5

Chalmet: Excellent! This is the one, thank you so much! You've been such a big help.
Chalmet: Please take these. And once I... Ow! Once I'm... a bit better, I can keep working...
Chalmet: *sigh* When will the Institute finally assign me an assistant...

## Talk 6

Chalmet: Huh? I think you got the wrong box, but... it's fine, there's plenty of files in this one that need organizing too.
Chalmet: Please take these. And once I... Ow! Once I'm... a bit better, I can keep working...
Chalmet: *sigh* When will the Institute finally assign me an assistant...

## Talk 7

Chalmet: You... Why did you bring both boxes of files over?
Traveler: I forgot which one it was!
Chalmet: Pffft... I guess that's just how you roll. Thanks! Both boxes have files I need to organize, anyway.
Chalmet: Since you've brought them both over, I should get going now. This is going to be a huge task!
Chalmet: Please, take these, and thank you again for your help, Honorary Senior Researcher.
Chalmet: *sigh* When will the Institute finally assign me an assistant...
Traveler: I thought you would need them both.
Chalmet: Your instincts are accurate as ever. Both boxes do indeed contain files I need to organize.
