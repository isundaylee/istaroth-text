# Talk Dialog

Nervous An: Hello there, friend. Have you decided on the sort of kites you'd like to make?
Nervous An: Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to pry. I just wanted to perhaps use your work as reference material.
Nervous An: I've been waiting for this holiday for so long, but now that it's here, I can't figure out which patterns I like...
Nervous An: I mean, there's no way I'll be sewing expired documents into a kite, surely?
Nervous An: I'm kidding. It's fine even if I don't have my own kite, really. It'll still be interesting watching others fly theirs.
