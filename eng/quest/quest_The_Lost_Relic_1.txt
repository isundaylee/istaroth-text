# The Lost Relic


## Talk 1

Bao'er: I can't find it anywhere...
Traveler: What did you lose this time...
Bao'er: Oh, this time I haven't lost anything yet — I'm still looking for it! But I can't find it anywhere...
Bao'er: Where could it be? After all the effort I've gone to to confirm its whereabouts...
Bao'er: Help me search for it, would you? We can't let something like this stay lost!
Traveler: Alright...
Bao'er: Okay, you take that side, I'll take this side.
Bao'er: We have to find it!
Traveler: What kind of relic is it this time?
Bao'er: It's... uh, it's an... It's really ancient, anyway! Dates back a thousand— no, all the way back to the Archon War, in fact.
Bao'er: Basically, it's a very precious relic and it simply cannot stay lost! So help me find it.

## Talk 2

Bao'er: I can't find it anywhere...
Traveler: What kind of relic is it this time?
Bao'er: It's... uh, it's an... It's really ancient, anyway! Dates back a thousand— no, all the way back to the Archon War, in fact.
Bao'er: Basically, it's a very precious relic and it simply cannot stay lost! So help me find it.

## Talk 3

Soraya: Thank you, Traveler! That was terrifying... the Treasure Hoarders are such savages these days.
Traveler: Who are you?
Soraya: I'm Soraya, a visiting scholar. I'm actually doing some research as we speak.
Soraya: A few days ago I followed a trail of clues to a ruin, where I found a jade plate that recorded details from the Archon War.
Soraya: But I was ambushed by the Treasure Hoarders on my way out. I tried to run away, but they caught up with me...
Soraya: If not for you, both I and the jade plate would have been in big trouble. So thanks again.
Traveler: You're a scholar, too?
Soraya: ...You mean, you've met other scholars around here? Like who?
Soraya: Bao'er...? Wait a second... Just now, when I was ambushed by the Treasure Hoarders, I heard someone complaining about Bao'er hogging all the treasure.
Soraya: What a strange coincidence... Could you tell me a little more about the Bao'er you met?
Traveler: Here's what I remember...
Soraya: ...Hmm. The locations Bao'er pointed out to you are the same ones I was targeting. Maybe this coincidence is not so coincidental after all...
Soraya: If she really is with the Treasure Hoarders, then I suspect they must have been following me around for some time... Hoping to get at some fresh ruin treasure via me.
Soraya: Bao'er wanted it all for herself, so she split off from the group and tried to get ahead. But this area is much too big for one person to search, so...
Soraya: It seems like she used you, Traveler. And I'll bet that she had her eyes set on this location for a long time — it's just her comrades and I got there before you did.
Soraya: Don't be alarmed, this is still just guesswork. But Bao'er... it's just a suspicious-sounding name. It could just be a fake name, or maybe a codename.
Soraya: Traveler, could you throw her off the scent? Whatever happens, this jade plate cannot get into the wrong hands.
Traveler: Sure.
Soraya: Thank you. Although, she'd probably sense something was up if you went back empty-handed.
Soraya: How about this — here's a little something you can give her instead.
Soraya: Barely enough for her to make a profit on. But hopefully enough to avoid her suspicion for now.
Soraya: Okay, you'd best get back. You may have just beaten the living daylights out of her comrades, but if she's traveling alone she shouldn't get word of it right away.
Soraya: Oh, and if you find something on any of her future treasure hunts, you can bring it to me. I'm usually at the Wangshu Inn.
Soraya: *sigh* ...I might not be good for a lot of things, but if I can keep a historical relic safe then at least that's something.
Traveler: If I return empty-handed, she'll get suspicious...
Soraya: Good point... In that case, take this. It's nothing of anything value, really.
Soraya: Barely enough for her to make a profit on. But hopefully enough to avoid her suspicion for now.

Bao'er: 05 Bao'er Conversation (For Bao'er)

## Talk 6

Bao'er: What took you so long? Did you find anything?
Traveler: I found this.
Bao'er: Huh... It's not bad, but... It doesn't look anything like the one I was looking for.
Bao'er: Still, a relic is a relic, so I'll take care of it. Don't worry, I'll see it gets put to good use.
Bao'er: Thanks for your help. In return, take these.
Bao'er: *sigh* But that other lost relic, I hope it's okay...
Traveler: Is this what you were looking for?
Bao'er: It's a nice item, but not the one I was looking for.
Bao'er: Wait, you don't know how to take proper care of relics, do you? You might damage it.
Bao'er: Best if I take care of it. I'll make sure it's put to good use.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Soraya: Fortunately, the jade plate is undamaged.
Traveler: Why didn't you just give it to them?
Soraya: A relic should be for scholars to study, for artists to take inspiration from, for people to admire in an exhibition...
Soraya: It must never be given to thieves to sell for petty cash. As well as dishonoring a precious relic, it's trampling all over history.
Soraya: I refuse to back down before people who treat history, and its relics, like trash.
Traveler: I want to know more about the jade plate.
Soraya: Oh, it's piqued your interest, has it? Well answer me this — are you interested in its cultural value, or its monetary value?
Soraya: I'm joking. This jade plate records an event from the Archon War — a clash of clans, if I'm not mistaken.
Soraya: If I can decipher it, maybe I can fill in some of the gaps in Sumeru Akademiya's records.
Soraya: Or maybe those gaps have been filled in already, I'm just not allowed to know about them...
