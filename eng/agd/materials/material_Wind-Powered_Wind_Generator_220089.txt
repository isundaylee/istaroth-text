# Wind-Powered Wind Generator

A wind generating device developed by Refait, senior researcher from Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering.
After being activated, this device can provide a strong lifting force for the Wind Glider user.
However, due to design limitations, the device requires utilizing significant wind power to activate. The wind energy required is approximately equal to that produced by the working Wind Glider.
"Umm... So you mean I can only activate this device when I'm already using the Wind Glider."
"But the only reason I even want to activate it is to give my Wind Glider a push!"
