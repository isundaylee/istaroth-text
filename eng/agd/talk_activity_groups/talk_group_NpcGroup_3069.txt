Kobayashi: Hello, are you here to take part in the festival?
Kobayashi: Ritou hasn't been this lively in ages, and we've got outlanders of all kinds walking the streets as well.
Kobayashi: I'm going to go have a walk once I finish work. My luck's been pretty good so far, so who knows? I might just snag the grand prize.

Kobayashi: Hmm? What is it?

Traveler: Where does this road lead?
Kobayashi: There's a place called Konda Village up ahead.
Kobayashi: ...Walk along the main road after leaving the village and you will find yourself near Inazuma City.
Kobayashi: Oh right. Do you have the permit to enter and leave Ritou?

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye...
Kobayashi: Hey! You can't run around without a permit!

## Talk

Traveler: Permit?
Kobayashi: I'm referring to the Travel Permit. It is a document issued by the Tenryou Commission or the Kanjou Commission that allows you to travel freely within Inazuma.
Kobayashi: ...You don't actually have one, do you?
Kobayashi: If you don't have one, just stay in Ritou.

Traveler: Travel Permit... do you mean this?
Kobayashi: Let me see... Yeah, that's the one. You are good then. You may pass here.

Traveler: Where does this road lead?
Kobayashi: There's a place called Konda Village up ahead.
Kobayashi: ...Walk along the main road after leaving the village and you will find yourself near Inazuma City.
Kobayashi: Oh, yes. You don't have any contraband items on your person, right?

## Talk

Traveler: Contraband items?
Kobayashi: Um, like... compasses that automatically search for treasure, bottles that allow you to fly, or boats armed with large cannons... and things like that?
Kobayashi: I mean, I'm just guessing, really. I'm honestly not sure what counts as contraband.
Kobayashi: And I mean, even if some dangerous does get through, they'll have to face the might of the Tenryou Commission when they're in the city!

Traveler: See you...
Kobayashi: You take care now.
