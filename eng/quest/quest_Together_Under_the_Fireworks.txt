# Together Under the Fireworks


## Talk 1

Morihiko: ...Be careful.
Morihiko: This is the Tenryou Commission we're talking about. Please, don't do anything you might live to regret.

## Talk 2

Yoimiya: It's Matsuzaka and his friends! Let's ask them!

## Talk 3

Imatani Saburou: I'm sorry that we weren't much help.
Imatani Kaori: One day, though, that child is going to have to face up to his feelings.
Imatani Kaori: This is one life lesson that he can't learn from his parents.

## Talk 4

Yoimiya: It looks like this is the right way. Let's keep going!
Yoimiya: If Sakujirou still hasn't made up his mind, I guess I'll have to step in...

## Talk 5

Yoimiya: Look, there are people from the Tenryou Commission over there! That must be them.

## Talk 6

Sakujirou: *panting*... *panting*...
Imatani Keisuke: Your skills with the sword have stagnated, Sakujirou...
Imatani Keisuke: You should have known that you stood no chance against me in a duel.
Sakujirou: I never imagined I'd fall into your hands.
Sakujirou: ...
Sakujirou: If this is to be my fate, I accept it. I have nothing else to say.
Imatani Keisuke: But your return says that you finally came around to my point of view.
Sakujirou: Whatever you say.
Imatani Keisuke: You will return with me to the Tenryou Commission to await your sentencing.
Imatani Keisuke: The one who made this boat will also be punished.
Yoimiya: Wait!
Yoimiya: It doesn't have to end like this! Don't you have anything else to say to one another!?
Imatani Keisuke: Hey, I know you. You're Naganohara's girl, who makes the fireworks... Huh. I know you like to get involved in other people's business, but stay out of this. It does not concern you.
Sakujirou: It's okay, Yoimiya. The past is the past.
Yoimiya: Then why did you risk life and limb to get yourself back into Inazuma!? And why were you so reluctant to leave after you got here!?
Yoimiya: I'll tell you why, this is why! This is the chance you've been waiting for, to talk everything through!
Imatani Keisuke: I have nothing to say to him.
Imatani Keisuke: He's a criminal, I work for the Tenryou Commission. There was never any room for discussion.
Imatani Keisuke: Out of respect for the friendship we once had, I gave him a chance to fight for his freedom. But his skills with the sword are as disappointing now as they ever were.
Yoimiya: What are you talking about? And just who do you think you're kidding!?
Yoimiya: You left all your subordinates back there to guard the road, making sure no one else followed you here. Seems to me like you were hoping for a chance to talk.
Yoimiya: I can see it in your faces. You both have so much to say... and you're just gonna choose to keep it all inside?
Imatani Keisuke: ...
Imatani Keisuke: Don't flatter yourself. What would you know?
Sakujirou: Yoimiya, leave it. It was just my wishful thinking.
Yoimiya: No, I won't leave it! I will not stand by and watch when you haven't even done anything!
Yoimiya: Keisuke, you seem to like settling things with a duel. So let's do it your way! I challenge you to a duel!
Yoimiya: If I win, then you need to say everything that's in your heart. No more running from your feelings!
Yoimiya: And the same goes for you, Sakujirou! If I win, you will tell Keisuke exactly why you came back. No matter what the consequences are. You have to tell him everything!
Yoimiya: If you don't say anything now, you may never have another chance!
Imatani Keisuke: And if you lose?
Yoimiya: Then I'll admit to collaborating with Sakujirou and accept the Tenryou Commission's punishment!
Sakujirou: Yoimiya...
Imatani Keisuke: I accept. Let's settle this with a duel.

## Talk 7

Yoshitaka: Sir, they are too strong. We need more men...
Imatani Keisuke: Stand down.
Yoshitaka: Wh—What?
Imatani Keisuke: I thought I told you to stay away! Now, stand down!
Yoshitaka: Y—Yes, Sir... Sorry!
Imatani Keisuke: Young lady, you are just as obstinate as Sakujirou was back then.
Imatani Keisuke: Why were you so convinced that we had things to say to each other?
Yoimiya: Because... Sakujirou may not have told me about you when he came back, but he did order a firework from me.
Yoimiya: Then, your parents told me what happened between you when you were younger. Once I'd heard the story, I realized that the firework meant something special to you both.
Yoimiya: And that's why I simply refuse to believe that you have nothing to say to each other!
Yoimiya: Nobody sets off a firework to feel lonely, do they...
Imatani Keisuke: ...
Sakujirou: The reason I came back is that... I felt lost.
Sakujirou: It wasn't that I'd changed my mind, I just felt that what I'd done in the past was to try to escape from reality.
Sakujirou: I saw the freedom of Mondstadt, the contracts of Liyue, the wisdom of Sumeru, and the justice of Fontaine... It all left a deep impression on me.
Sakujirou: I was glad that I'd left Inazuma. But then I happened to hear about the Sakoku Decree.
Sakujirou: I was an escapee, and I was proud of that. But really, what I should have tried to do is take the good things from the outside world and bring them back home.
Imatani Keisuke: So that's why you came back? Out of your naive hope of changing the way things are here?
Sakujirou: No, I let go of those delusions of grandeur. I just felt that... I never should have run away like that...
Sakujirou: After all, you never ran away.
Imatani Keisuke: ...!
Sakujirou: I don't know about you, but life hasn't been easy for me.
Sakujirou: But I just had to come back and visit. It was like fate was calling me, and I couldn't ignore it any longer.
Imatani Keisuke: ...Life isn't easy for anyone.
Imatani Keisuke: I truly worship the Raiden Shogun. Her ideas are my personal creed, and I desire nothing more than to see her will done.
Imatani Keisuke: But now, my role is to punish violators of the Sakoku Decree and confiscate people's Visions. It's not what I signed up for when I joined the Tenryou Commission...
Imatani Keisuke: I do wonder... Am I really doing the right thing?
Imatani Keisuke: ...
Sakujirou: ...
Imatani Keisuke: The boat is yours.
Sakujirou: Huh?
Imatani Keisuke: I couldn't make you stay in Inazuma, but that doesn't mean I want to keep you here by force.
Sakujirou: What will you say to the higher-ups?
Imatani Keisuke: Don't worry about that. I'll handle it.
Imatani Keisuke: If you wanna come back, I hear that the process of returning to Inazuma from the outside world is long and complicated. But it can be done.
Imatani Keisuke: I will lend you my help. But until then, wait for me out there.
Imatani Keisuke: ...And don't kick the bucket on the way out.
Sakujirou: Don't worry, Keisuke.
Sakujirou: Any chance we could watch the fireworks together?
Imatani Keisuke: Mm. Maybe next time.
Imatani Keisuke: *sigh* I'll be demoted for sure...
Imatani Keisuke: It's not like me to give in to childish sentiment like this. I can't explain why I went through with it.
Traveler: That boat...
Imatani Keisuke: It's the one that Sakujirou planned on using for his escape. I asked Yoshitaka and the others to transport it here, citing the Temporary Contraband Storage clause.
Imatani Keisuke: Forcing Sakujirou to this spot was also something I had planned all along.
Imatani Keisuke: It's just like you said, Yoimiya. Even though I hadn't fully made up my mind, my actions betrayed my intent...
Yoimiya: But I think you did the right thing. And look, now you've managed to resolve the grievance in your heart by talking about it.
Imatani Keisuke: I understand now, thank you. I didn't know you were quite so perceptive — you saw right into what I was thinking.
Yoimiya: Hehe, that's only because I know your parents so well. They're both really nice people, so I didn't think the apple would fall too far from the tree.
Imatani Keisuke: I had heard that there was a new Naganohara running things these days. A little loud and reckless, maybe but... You live up to the family name.
Imatani Keisuke: By the way, Naganohara Fireworks can reproduce the firework that the two of us set off back then, right? Would you be able to make one for me?
Yoimiya: Sorry, no can do. Without the slip for reference, I can't make the same one again, and I'm afraid Sakujirou is the one with the slip.
Imatani Keisuke: Ah, I see...
Imatani Keisuke: Never mind, then.
Yoimiya: Hehe, don't get too down just yet, though — I mentioned that Sakujirou ordered a firework from me, didn't I?
Yoimiya: I can't make another one, but I'm guessing Sakujirou probably won't be needing his anymore... It'd be a shame for it to go to waste, so I'll make an exception and let you set it off instead.
Imatani Keisuke: ...Thank you very much.
Yoimiya: No worries. And don't miss out on the start of the fireworks show.
Paimon: Yoimiya, the way you took command of that whole situation was amazing!
Yoimiya: What can I say — I like to talk. I'm a strong believer in the power of words.
Yoimiya: If you're not willing to communicate, then the problem just sits there. If you just keep staring at it without doing anything, eventually you'll watch every last opportunity to resolve it slip away before your eyes.
Yoimiya: Sakujirou and Keisuke can't turn back the clock in their relationship, but... that's no reason to live with remorse.
Yoimiya: Anyway, follow me. I'll bring you to the perfect place to watch the fireworks.
Yoimiya: My pops will set off the firework that I wanted to give to you.

## Talk 8

Yoimiya: Ahh, that was amazing. It was so beautiful I could weep.
Yoimiya: Uh, I didn't actually cry, though, right? I just feel a bit misty-eyed.
Traveler: It was very pretty.
Yoimiya: Oh, remember that big one that went up first? The gold one?
Yoimiya: That's the one I had pops make for you.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon saw it! It was one of the best ones, they won't forget that any time soon!
Yoimiya: Haha, that's what I wanted to hear. I was hoping it would leave a deep impression on you guys.
Yoimiya: No matter where your journey takes you, and no matter what hardships might lie ahead, I hope you'll always be able to look back fondly on the fireworks you saw tonight.
Yoimiya: I believe that as time goes by, this firework will only grow brighter and more beautiful in your heart.
Yoimiya: Oh, and also, you're technically my customers now. Here, this is your paper slip. If you ever wanna see that golden firework again, just come and see me.
Traveler: Thank you for the firework.
Paimon: You know, Yoimiya, you seemed to turn into a completely different person during the fireworks. You were so quiet, and it was like you couldn't hear anything at all.
Yoimiya: Oh, I could hear you. I just have a habit of being silent while I'm watching fireworks.
Yoimiya: Quietly watching something you made with your own hands rise into the sky, it feels like a sacred ceremony to me.
Yoimiya: You asked me what fireworks mean to me, right?
Paimon: Yup!
Paimon: Well, for Kouichi, who built that boat for us, and his friend, Third Sis, fireworks commemorate friendship.
Paimon: For Keisuke's parents, they commemorate marriage.
Paimon: And for Keisuke and Sakujirou, they were commemorating... hmm.
Traveler: Unwavering beliefs, right?
Paimon: Oh yeah, right! Beliefs!
Yoimiya: As for me...
Yoimiya: Hehe, to be honest, even though I've thought about it countless times before, I still haven't found an answer.
Paimon: Seriously? Huh... Paimon was expecting something deep and philosophical.
Yoimiya: Well, no one has ever asked me this before, so I've never really settled on an answer.
Yoimiya: It was by chance that I happened to be born into the Naganohara family, so it was by chance that I ended up learning this craft from my pops.
Yoimiya: It's also by chance that I've met so many people, learned so many things, and discovered that people associate watching fireworks with the things that are most precious to them.
Yoimiya: Fireworks that disappear in a flash of light are probably the furthest thing away from the eternity that our Shogun desires.
Yoimiya: But people's feelings don't just disappear, and it's those feelings that give fireworks their purpose. If nobody wanted to watch fireworks, then they wouldn't exist.
Traveler: That's another kind of eternity.
Yoimiya: Also, consider this: You have to have the Naganoharas, because so many people are emotionally invested in the existence of fireworks.
Yoimiya: If we didn't exist, their wishes would go unfulfilled, wouldn't they?
Yoimiya: #You know, {NICKNAME}, I don't really think about complicated things like this very often...
Yoimiya: But I'm proud that I was born into the Naganohara family, and have the chance to make so many pretty fireworks.
Traveler: Thank you for your kindness.
Traveler: Once again, the Naganoharas live up to their name.

## Talk 9

Imatani Saburou: I'm sorry that we weren't much help.
Imatani Kaori: One day, though, that child is going to have to face up to his feelings.
Imatani Kaori: This is one life lesson that he can't learn from his parents.

## Talk 10

Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Things aren't boding well for Sakujirou.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: If only there was something we could do...
