# Root Cycle

One of the keys designed by the Narzissenkreuz Ordo for the tower. When combined, the keys form a peculiar shape of three and a half circles, for which there is a special explanation.
The middle circle is the Cycle of Natlantea, symbolizing the triumph over the evil dragon, a metaphor for humanity's victory over nature as well as the beasts within themselves.
