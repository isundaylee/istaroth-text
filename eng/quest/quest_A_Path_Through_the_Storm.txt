# A Path Through the Storm


## Talk 1

Paimon: #Are you okay? Paimon never imagined your {F#brother}{M#sister} would have sided with the Abyss...
Traveler: I'm feeling a bit better.
Paimon: #Well, keep your chin up, {NICKNAME}!
Paimon: Paimon believes in both of you.
Paimon: And when the going gets tough, the tough get going! Right?
Traveler: Yeah. You're right.
Paimon: #{F#He}{M#She} said we needed to "reach the end of our journey..." Paimon bets {F#he}{M#she} still has lots more to tell us!
Paimon: And we won't find out what this "journey" is or where it will end unless we keep going!
Traveler: Thank you, Paimon.
Paimon: Aw, don't mention it, partner! Travel buddies are supposed to look out for one another.
Paimon: Although... where should we go next? If we want to continue with the journey... hmm...
Traveler: I still need to find that god...
Paimon: #Oh! You mean, the god that took your {F#brother}{M#sister} away in the first place...
Paimon: ...You're right. After all, everything that followed... all this confusion... it all started with her.
Traveler: I need answers from her.
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon bets she's the key to understanding this whole mystery.
Paimon: Well, we've ruled out two gods so far — the Anemo and Geo Archons. So, next...
Traveler: Let's go to Inazuma.
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon doesn't think we can simply walk into Inazuma. Zhongli said it was a closed nation. We'll have to find some other way in...
Paimon: Why don't we ask someone from Inazuma how to gain entrance?
Traveler: Let me try and think of someone...
Paimon: Oh, Paimon's thought of someone already — Atsuko, in Liyue Harbor! She's from Inazuma.
Paimon: Let's see what she has to say!
Traveler: I'm sure there is someone we've met...
Traveler: Let's find the Electro Archon.
Traveler: I need to teach her a lesson she won't forget.
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon supports that idea! Just the thought of it is so satisfying!
Traveler: I'm glad to have you as a guide, Paimon.
Paimon: Hee-hee, then Paimon will be sure to keep up the good work!
Traveler: There must be more to this than meets the eye.
Traveler: I still can't accept it...

## Talk 2

Atsuko: Hello... Oh! I—I mean, good fortune... right? *sigh* I'm still learning to talk like a local, haha...
Atsuko: Is there anything I can help you with?
Paimon: We wanted to ask... how do we get into Inazuma?
Atsuko: Ohh, so that's why you're here... Well, there is a way...
Paimon: Great! We came to the right person!
Atsuko: But the chance of success is... incredibly small.
Paimon: Huh? Incredibly small? Then how did you get out of Inazuma in the first place?
Atsuko: It was in leaving Inazuma that I found out just how dangerous this method truly was...
Atsuko: All I had to rely on was a little wooden raft that I'd put together myself. There was a storm raging ahead of me, and my pursuers were close on my tail.
Atsuko: After I'd escaped their clutches, I floated on the open ocean for... I don't know how many days. My rations and fresh water supply soon ran out, and I remember getting to the point where I was sure I'd reached the end. Then, I blacked out.
Atsuko: But, to my surprise, my journey didn't end there... or to put it another way, a new beginning found me.
Traveler: Did someone from Liyue save you?
Atsuko: That's right! I escaped by the skin of my teeth. The fact that I'm even alive to tell the tale must be a sign that the gods were watching over me.
Paimon: What a horrible journey! And you set off knowing how dangerous it was? Why?
Atsuko: Well... because everything is just too restrictive over there. The atmosphere is so stifling... The Kanjou Commission subjects everyone leaving or entering the nation to a protracted approval process, and... I felt like I didn't belong there.
Paimon: Kanjou Commission? What's that?
Atsuko: Along with the other two commissions, they oversee everything in Inazuma. We usually collectively refer to them as the Tri-Commission — I suppose they're equivalent to the Eight Trades under the Liyue Qixing.
Atsuko: One of the obligations of the Kanjou Commission is to conduct rigorous identity checks on all individuals leaving or entering Inazuma. All non-nationals are processed centrally on Ritou upon arrival...
Atsuko: Meanwhile, the Tenryou Commission is responsible for implementing the recently promulgated Vision Hunt Decree. They act like the executive arm of the Raiden Shogun's rule, loyal yet unfeeling.
Atsuko: It doesn't feel good to speak ill of my home like this... but after spending so long under that oppressive atmosphere, I began to lose all hope for the future.
Atsuko: What I mean to say is... unless you have an extremely compelling reason to go to Inazuma, you should abandon your plans of trying to get there.
Traveler: I have a compelling reason.
Atsuko: *sigh* You should know that the sea around Inazuma is engulfed in a perpetual tempest of wind and rain. Supposing you survived that, you would still need to get past the samurai guards that enforce the Sakoku Decree — the closed nation policy of Inazuma.
Atsuko: And even if you did manage to find a way, you'd still have to produce the necessary documentation at the Ritou center for processing outlanders. Otherwise, you'd be kicked out immediately...
Paimon: Seems like they really don't want anyone setting foot in Inazuma, huh...
Traveler: But they have Ritou...
Atsuko: They only set that up as a port to guarantee a supply of goods and information to the island. Most outlanders would be unable to acquire the documentation needed.
Atsuko: But if you really are set on going, there is one thing you could try...
Paimon: Uh... The raft idea sounds a little on the dangerous side... plus Paimon would definitely get seasick.
Atsuko: That's not what I meant. You could ask someone from The Crux Fleet if they have some way of getting you to Inazuma, they're well-known in Liyue.
Atsuko: Voyaging far and wide has made them a well-traveled group with a wide range of experiences. They may just know how to break through the storm.
Paimon: But... it's an armed fleet, right? Why would they agree to a request like this?
Atsuko: That part is up to you! If you're able to persuade their captain, Beidou, then the hardest part will be out of the way.
Traveler: Let's give it a try.
Atsuko: The Alcor is the flagship of The Crux Fleet. I heard that it's currently anchored by Guyun Stone Forest on a supply run. This might be your best chance.
Paimon: Then there's no time to lose! Let's go find Captain Beidou!
Traveler: It seems like our only option.
Traveler: But there's a place for outlanders to go, right?
Traveler: There are answers to questions I must know there.

## Talk 3

Beidou: #Hmm? Who've we got here... Wait, I know you. You're that traveler, {NICKNAME}, aren't you? The one who fought against the Fatui and Osial, right?
Traveler: Have we met?
Beidou: Haha, Ningguang told me about you. "A traveler of great insight and remarkable skill has saved Liyue," she said.
Beidou: She's a hard one to please... so praise from her is high praise indeed. I remember thinking at the time that it'd be good to meet you in person.
Beidou: Judging by the clothes on your back and this floating thing, I guess that time has come.
Paimon: Hey! The name's not "floating thing," it's PAIMON!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Paimon... hmm... What a fascinating being. You two give off not only the essence of wind and earth, but also of... yes... the stars...
Paimon: Eh? The fragrance of what now? That's the weirdest compliment Paimon's ever heard...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Pay it no heed... I mean only to say I am certain... that it is by fate, not chance alone, that we should meet... and that gives our encounter meaning.
Traveler: Is this guy a bard, by any chance?
Beidou: You're not far off, but they go by a different name in Inazuma.
Beidou: Uh, I prefer... other means of entertainment.
Beidou: This young man is Kaedehara Kazuha, a temporary addition to my crew for reasons I won't bore you with. Occasionally, he opens his mouth and flowers come out instead of words.
Kaedehara Kazuha: With this fine ship and the soft sea breeze... would it not be romantically irresponsible of me not to acknowledge it with a line or two of poetry?
Beidou: Haha, can't argue with that... Okay then, once The Clash is underway, I'll give you a chance to perform.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Only if the mood takes me, of course. Poetry for poetry's sake tends to lack meaning.
Beidou: Hey, you don't wanna pass this opportunity up too easily, especially seeing as our great hero here might be in attendance.
Paimon: Wait a minute, what's The Clash? Also, just to clarify, by "great hero"... do you mean...
Beidou: Huh? I thought you might be here to sign up... You're telling me you've never even heard of it?
Beidou: The Crux Clash is a martial arts tournament that I hold. There'll be a whole bunch of folks taking part to showcase their talents.
Beidou: There are two important rules. One — competitors must be renowned fighters. We want those with real martial arts ability, not just people taking part for the fun of it.
Beidou: So, you've got nothing to worry about there. I don't think there's anyone out there who hasn't heard of you.
Beidou: Two — you can't take part if you've got a Vision. Otherwise, things get a little... one-sided.
Traveler: I don't have a Vision, but—
Beidou: Haha, you must be feeling confident, but you might wanna watch out — there are a few crouching tigers and hidden dragons lurking around in Liyue.
Beidou: And with Liyue's savior taking part in the tournament... now that's gonna turn a few heads. I think we can expect a healthy turnout this time...
Paimon: But... we didn't come here to take part in a martial arts tournament.
Beidou: Well, before you dismiss the idea completely, you might be interested to hear that the prize this time 'round is particularly sought after...
Beidou: Get this — it's a Masterless Vision!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Supplied by myself, as a matter of fact. If the tournament champion can reawaken that Vision... it belongs to them.
Paimon: Is there really such thing as a masterless Vision!?
Traveler: Why doesn't it have a master?
Kaedehara Kazuha: When a Vision bearer dies, the light in their Vision will fade away. But the shell that housed that light remains.
Kaedehara Kazuha: As for whether this shell has any practical application, well, this remains to be seen. But my intuition tells me that while it remains in the world, it may just be possible for someone else to inherit it.
Beidou: Yep, and the way I see it, a Vision is a badge of recognition from the gods — so if anyone's able to rekindle it, it's got to be an individual of exceptional strength and talent.
Beidou: Organizing The Clash is my way of uncovering hidden talents... and hopefully, this time, of getting a Vision to glow again.
Beidou: So, if you don't have a Vision, this is the perfect opportunity to get your hands on one of your very own.
Traveler: To be honest, I'm not interested.
Paimon: Yeah, we're interested in getting to Inazuma, not fighting in some tournament!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Inazuma? You... want to go there?
Beidou: Well, why didn't you say so! Inazuma? No sweat.
Beidou: In that case, if you win the tournament, I'll give you a choice: Masterless Vision, or a ticket to Inazuma aboard The Alcor. Up to you.
Traveler: That was easy!
Paimon: #You just want {F#her}{M#him} to take part in your tournament!
Beidou: Hahaha, what's wrong with that? The more talent we have, the better the tournament will be. I couldn't let a competitor like you fall through the net.
Paimon: #What're we gonna do, {NICKNAME}? *sigh* Looks like we pretty much have to do this tournament if we want to get to Inazuma, huh?
Traveler: I'm not worried.
Beidou: Great, then, let's get you signed up! Head to the tournament arena in Guyun Stone Forest. Kazuha and I will be over soon.
Kaedehara Kazuha: It seems like it will only be a matter of time before the answer is revealed...
Traveler: Let's give this a shot.
Traveler: A Vision is of no use to me.
Traveler: ...And this must be your bard-for-hire?
Traveler: My reputation precedes me...

## Talk 4

Jinyou: Hey, youngster. Are you here for The Crux Clash too?
Jinyou: If so... seems I've found myself another new adversary.
Paimon: So you're also here for the tournament?
Jinyou: You better believe it. I wouldn't be here if I didn't think I could walk away as a champion.
Jinyou: For me, obtaining a Vision is the final and most important piece in the puzzle that is my life.
Traveler: Do you want to become an adventurer?
Jinyou: No, no, no — it's not about what I want to do. This is about who I want to be. I am looking to become a perfect person.
Jinyou: I know how that sounds, but let me explain. I've lived a successful life so far, without any setbacks.
Jinyou: I've passed every exam I've ever taken, enjoyed numerous successful business ventures, and seem to get on with just about everyone socially...
Jinyou: In most people's eyes, I am already the very embodiment of the perfect person, though of course, I'd never let the praise get to my head. I know I haven't reached perfection yet... because there's one thing I'm still missing...
Jinyou: ...A Vision.
Paimon: You have so much self-confidence...
Traveler: Do you have tournament experience?
Jinyou: That's not important... I have a contact in The Crux Fleet who was happy to vouch for me. So, they very kindly made special arrangements on my behalf.
Jinyou: I've also brought along a bit of an entourage, for moral support. It's such a blessing, really, to have so many good friends in my neighborhood.
Jinyou: Of course, I also put in a few good days' practice, concentrating mostly on rare and esoteric styles of kung fu. As a high-achiever by nature, I'm confident I've done enough to guarantee my victory in this tournament.
Traveler: Don't be so sure.
Jinyou: Hah, you don't mince your words, do you... The arena will be the judge.
Jinyou: Now then, if you don't mind, I need to finish my pre-competition routine. It's not too long now before you'll get to see me in action.
Traveler: I'm sure you have.
Jinyou: Haha, I seem to have gained another fan. Don't let my aura overwhelm you, though. You'll need your wits about you today.
Traveler: Are you a renowned fighter?
Traveler: Do you want to become a hero?
