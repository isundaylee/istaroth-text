# Archery Demonstration


## Talk 1

Shouji: Ugh, I missed again... Where am I going wrong?
Traveler: Still practicing archery, I see?
Shouji: Oh, you're... Thank you so much for that demonstration you gave us previously!
Shouji: Thanks to you, I've...
Traveler: Become a real sniper elite?
Shouji: Uh, I'm not quite there yet, no...
Shouji: But I can now hit five out of ten shots, at least... And it's all thanks to you.
Shouji: Our drillmasters still want to see more out of me, though, so I'll keep working at it.
Shouji: ...Um, since you're here, do you mind putting on another demonstration?
Shouji: With your help, I believe that I'll make progress even faster.
Traveler: Sure.
Shouji: Thank you so much! I promise I'll watch closely!
Shouji: I'll leave the demonstration to you. I promise I'll watch closely.
Traveler: Did you solve all your previous issues?
Shouji: Oh, you mean, my bad posture, draw strength, and grip?
Shouji: ...I'll be honest and say that I'm still on my way to fixing them all.
Shouji: But other than these issues, my other worry is that I won't be able to use the skills I've learned in a real battle...
Shouji: *cough* Still, I suppose I need to get the basics down first before I can worry about that.
Shouji: I'll leave the demonstration to you. I promise I'll watch closely.
Traveler: Become a master marksman?

## Talk 2

Shouji: Huh, it seems like there was something off about the way you shot back there...
Traveler: Could you help me place the targets again?
Shouji: Oh, no problem at all, let me go do that right now. Just take the shots once I'm done.

## Talk 3

Shouji: Your skills are as sharp as ever.
Traveler: Hope you were watching closely.
Shouji: Of course I was! I was watching everything from your grip to your draw!
Shouji: ...Hmm, how should I put this, though? It feels like the more I watch, the more I can sense the gulf in our skills...
Shouji: Wâ€”Well, best not to dwell on that right now. Please take these as thanks for that demonstration.
Shouji: I'll start training myself in a bit. Let's set our target at... seven out of ten shots, how about that?
