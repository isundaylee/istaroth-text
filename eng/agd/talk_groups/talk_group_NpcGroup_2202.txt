Huai'an: Greetings! My name is Huai'an, and I am the innkeeper. I would encourage you to stay here for a few days, but it seems that you have pressing matters to attend to...
Huai'an: I fear the recent meteorites are bad omens. You will fare better if you steer well clear of them.

Huai'an: Hello! I am Huai'an, innkeeper of the Wangshu Inn. Are you in need of a meal, or a room for the night?

Traveler: How's business been lately?
Huai'an: Thanks to yourself and all our dear guests, business has been going reasonably well. We will get by.
Huai'an: Haha, it's getting livelier again.
Traveler: What can you tell me about the rumors?
Huai'an: Rumors? What rumors?
Huai'an: If you mean someone's been bad-mouthing the Wangshu Inn, don't believe a word of what you hear.
Huai'an: But if you just wanted to get the lowdown about what's been going on recently...
Huai'an: The Fatui's presence in Liyue Harbor has been growing recently. It looks like trouble is brewing.
Huai'an: Now it's your turn! Any interesting stories to share with me?
Traveler: Who's this lovely doggie?
Huai'an: This is Richie! We called him that hoping it would bring us good luck.
Huai'an: He's a good boy, aren't you Richie? He doesn't make a mess and he's good with the guests.

Traveler: Who's that over there? She doesn't look like she's from Liyue.
Huai'an: Ah yes, that would be my wife. She moved from Mondstadt to marry me.
Huai'an: When I was a child we used to sing this nursery rhyme about Liyue women: "Half the girls marry to a winery town, the other half sail to a faraway land."
Huai'an: Oh, how the tables have turned... I feel quite proud to have broken the mold! Hahaha.
Huai'an: Goldet is very sharp. She picks up on all these little details about people and figures out their backgrounds.

Traveler: Please excuse me.
Huai'an: Alright, goodbye. Stop in for a chat anytime! You're always welcome at the Wangshu Inn.
