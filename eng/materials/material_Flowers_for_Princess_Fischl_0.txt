# Flowers for Princess Fischl (0)

The preliminary volume of the "Flowers for Princess Fischl" series.
This work originally came in a violet and black wooden box as a limited edition gift, but many hardcore fans of the series who wanted to collect the whole saga were enraged by the great amount of content versus the small number of copies printed.
Due to this, Yae Publishing House would name this book "Volume 0" and sell it separately. Eventually, the original work, the boxed collector's edition, and Volume 0 would all come to be regarded as standard by fans.
