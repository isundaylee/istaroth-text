Padisarah: Fairy Nilou, can you teach Padisarah how to dance?
Nilou: Oh, of course! How about we start off with the most basic steps?
Padisarah: Okay!
Nilou: What about you, Grandpa Almond? Would you like to join?
Almond: This old nutcracker? Hah, I'm not quite as limber as I used to be...
Padisarah: C'mon, Grandpa Almond! Join us!
Almond: Alright, alright... Grandpa can't say no to you, can he...

## Talk 1

Citrus: Just fixed the kink in my neck, and now my arms feel like they're gonna fall off...
Citrus: But, seeing the Tavern full and lively again makes it all worth it.

## Talk 2

Ginkgo: Our kind Fairy dances just as beautifully as the Goddess of Creation!
Chestnut: Here we go again... Let me guess, she was dancing when your grandfather saw her create life, was she?
Ginkgo: Haha, very funny. A goddess is all-powerful! Of course she can dance.

## Talk 3

Stream: Um, Firecracker, I think you've had enough...
Firecracker: Look, I'm just really happy for you, okay? *hiccup* Happy for... all of us... the entire Forest!
Stream: Listen to you... You're going to ruin your voice if you keep going!
Firecracker: Ahahahaha! *hiccup*

## Talk 4

Navia: This way, Miss Nilou. After you!
Nilou: Thank you, Miss Navia, but it's fine... I don't mind not riding the Aerial Express...
Navia: What is it? Are you scared of heights?
Nilou: Huh? No, it's not that, it's just...
Navia: Then you'll be fine! If you feel scared, just hold onto my hand. And if you feel really scared... Hold onto both of them!
Navia: You're never gonna see something like this again, why not just go for it? Live in the moment, have some fun!
Nilou: Yeah... Yeah, you're right!
Nilou: Big circle, and exhale... Alright, I'm ready. Let's go!

## Talk 5

Bizerte: Captain, do you need help with anything?
Montagne: Why do you ask?
Bizerte: Because Her Majesty the King, the revered "Boss" herself, has personally advised me to help the people around me.
Bizerte: And, well... You're around me. You're right here. Right there.
Montagne: ...
Bizerte: ...Sorry, that was just me trying to liven things up a little, ahem... Anyway, I think we should head out and see if the residents of the city need our assistance.
Montagne: Good idea. I will lead the way.

## Talk 6

Fischl: Ahem, Oz! Uh, though I customarily refer to you as my familiar, in truth, I... I have always seen you as...
Oz: ...Say no more, Mein Fräulein. I, Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, hereby pledge to always stay by your side.
Fischl: ...Hmph! Quite rightly so! The Prinzessin should expect no less from her most favored Nachtraben!
Oz: I couldn't agree more, Mein Fräulein.

## Talk 7

#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...
Nahida: The people from the Akademiya say they haven't seen you in a while.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Yeah, well maybe I needed some space after being cooped up in there for so long. Anyway, it's a school, not a prison, so what's the problem?
Nahida: I never said it was a problem. I was just noticing that you seem to be in quite a good mood at the moment.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...
Mini Durin: Who's this, Hat Guy?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Shut up. Not another word.
Nahida: You made a new friend!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...I've told you already. Stop trying to read my mind.
Nahida: I didn't need to. It's written all over your face!
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Ugh...

## Talk 8

Stream: Wow! What a gorgeous lotus stage! Fit for the Forest Fairy herself, after all.
Almond: Mhm... A wonderful sight indeed. But, uh... Madame Fairy, I believe the dog over there has been staring at us for quite a while...
Nilou: Ah, that's Swoof! Don't worry, he's a good dog. He doesn't bite.
Swoof: Woof, woof!
Nilou: Haha, that's a good boy! I haven't seen you in ages, Swoof. No eating the frogs and hamsters here, okay?
Padisarah: No eating!
Swoof: Woof!
Almond: Ah... Haha, what a, what a well-behaved doggie. You see, Stream? I told you, didn't I? The outside world isn't nearly as dangerous as we feared.
Stream: Mhm, you were right. But with that said, Grandpa Almond... why are you hiding behind me?

## Talk 9

Navia: ...And that's the way the cookie crumbled! So, what do you think? You two fancy taking a stroll around my kingdom?
Chiori: ...Sounds like someone's been playing a little too much Tabletop Troupe?
Clorinde: Not at all. I actually haven't seen her at all in a little while.
Navia: Ugh, I'm telling you, it's all real! Just come with me, and you'll see it for yourself!
Chiori: So you were the "King," huh? Hmm... Somehow, that part doesn't sound so far-fetched. I actually think you'd fill those boots quite easily.
Navia: Thanks for the vote of confidence!
Chiori: Well, if we're going to be traveling with a King, we'll need proper titles as well, right? I guess... I can be the royal tailor.
Clorinde: Okay... Then I'll be Her Majesty's personal bodyguard?
Navia: Hahaha, I'm sure those would work, but we don't have rules like that in my kingdom! Oh yeah, and can we go buy a music box first?
Chiori: ...Why, exactly?
Navia: Let's just say I've developed a new appreciation for them after my recent adventures.
Navia: Just imagine it... One night, while I'm asleep, one of the small dancing figures in the music box suddenly steps off its track, and starts moving on its own... Wouldn't that be amazing?
Clorinde: ...
Clorinde: Though this may be a normal occurrence in your fairytale world, Your Majesty, I must implore you to inform me immediately should any such incidents transpire in the real world.
Clorinde: Because, from the perspective of a Marechaussee Hunter... or really, any normal person...
Chiori: That music box sounds like bad news.

## Talk 10

Kirara: Hey there! It's good to see you again.
Traveler: About your clothes...
Kirara: Hehe, pretty amazing, right? I never thought I'd be able to keep this outfit in the real world! I really like the texture, too — it feels so nice against my skin. Still, not the best thing to wear when I'm out on a delivery...
Kirara: Something about running around carrying a parcel when I'm dressed like this seems to make everyone suspicious... Especially the Gardes, the Millelith, and so on. They always stop me and interrogate me on the spot.
Kirara: *sigh*... Guess I'll just have to switch back to my old outfit when I'm on the job.
Traveler: About the recent adventure...
Kirara: Oh, it was fantastic! A magical world, full of things I'd never seen before. Great scenery, really friendly people... Oh, and I also took a trip back to the Forest of Blessings after we parted ways.
Kirara: Grandpa Almond introduced me to everyone in the Forest, and reassured them that I wouldn't scratch anything. I made sure to fully retract my claws while I was there — I didn't wanna find out how they'd react to seeing them!
Kirara: Hehe, with this adventure under my belt, I can turn the tables on my grandma — it's my turn to tell her some stories!
Traveler: About your future plans...
Kirara: After peace returned to Simulanka, a lot of people started saying they wanted to pay a visit to the world beyond. But they're a little worried about whether it's safe or not.
Kirara: If any of them do visit Teyvat, I'd love to be their guide. I could even use my delivery box to take them around! If anyone understands the joy of seeing new things, it's me!
Traveler: Let's catch up another time.
Kirara: Sure thing! It's always a pleasure adventuring with you guys. I had so much fun!

Alof: Such commendable courage! Excellent. Please, then, step into the Domain.

### Talk 11 related talk 1

Traveler: About the "Owl Musician"...
Alof: Ah, interested in this story as well? Allow me to give you a quick summary, then.
Alof: This story tells of a kingdom locked in battle against strange monsters.
Alof: ...Do forgive me for skipping over most of the combat abilities, magical effects, and so on.
Alof: The first third of the story is all about describing the special abilities of each guard in some detail... which, come to think of it, is probably why it was so popular among the troops.
Alof: In the second half, the monsters use their last resort, corroding the kingdom using a "dark night," before attacking through that darkness.
Alof: The guards were forced back to their final bastion — the palace interior. But the world outside was being eroded by the devouring darkness. Even the palace lamps were gradually extinguished.
Alof: As the final light went out, everyone readied themselves for the final battle, resolving to fight to the end, come what may.

Traveler: (Keep listening.)
Alof: Suddenly, the sound of flapping wings soared through the palace, and a flight of owls swooped in through a window.
Alof: They were the friends of the palace musician, and when the monsters invaded, the musician knew that the palace would become a battleground, and so had sent those owls away to the forest — and now, they had returned.
Alof: These warriors, who could see through the darkness, circled throughout the palace, using their hoots to alert the musician to the places where enemies lurked.
Alof: The musician sat before their organ, a grand instrument that had played during countless balls, and which was powerful enough to send its music through to every last corner of the palace.
Traveler: (Keep listening.)
Alof: The palace soldiers lifted up their hearts and swords amidst the great swell of the organ, for they now knew where they should swing.
Alof: The musician played, pausing periodically to hearken to the owls' observations, while the soldiers would form defensive formations during those brief pauses.
Alof: Thus were the monsters repelled as the warriors used the palace as their fortress, driving them out through the darkness under the guidance of the owls and the musician.
Alof: At last, peace was restored to the palace, and the music that guided the warriors into battle became widespread... And that's how the story ends.
Traveler: (Stop listening...)

### Talk 17 related talk 1

Traveler: About the "Flying Hatter"...
Devitt: Interested in this tale, are you? Hahaha. I'll go over it with you — it's not too long a tale.
Devitt: Hmm... So our tale begins with a masterful hatter.
Devitt: This maker of hats made the very best ones in the world, and each day, there would be a stupendous crowd outside his door. Still, he would make each hat properly and beautifully.
Devitt: Some said that he had even once been commissioned by a goddess to make ten beautiful hats of different styles.
Devitt: To thank him for his craftsmanship, she offered to grant him a wish. But the hatmaker said that he did not have any unfulfilled wishes.
Devitt: He loved what he did, making hats, and everyone loved the hats he made — and that was enough for him.
Devitt: The goddess acknowledged his noble answer, but also stated that her promise would remain valid.
Devitt: Should he ever be willing to make a wish, she would be ready to grant it immediately.

Traveler: (Keep listening.)
Devitt: But before the hatter had thought of something he truly wanted fulfilled, soldiers in the employ of a noble suddenly came knocking at his door.
Devitt: "Our Lord orders you to make him the best hat," a soldier said in an overbearing tone.
Devitt: "Sure. I'll have it delivered to him once it is done. But before that, I have to..."
Devitt: "No! From now on, you shall only make hats for our lord!" The soldier cut him off. The cold light glinted off their blades and spears, and he had no choice but to leave with them.
Devitt: At the palace, the noble welcomed him warmly, even throwing him a grand banquet.
Devitt: "Come then, make me the best hat! Should not the most powerful of people have the loveliest of hats? Hahaha!" The nobleman laughed loudly, but the hatmaker could not bring himself to eat a single bite.

Traveler: (Keep listening.)
Devitt: He knew then that he could never again leave that palace. He had heard of this noble's deeds — he was stingy, and loved to plunder. Seizing and hoarding consumed his every waking thought.
Devitt: But he was no heroic thief or great mage — he was simply a hatter, and hats could not help him deceive the guards nor vault the towering walls.
Devitt: And at that moment, the aggrieved hatter remembered the goddess's promise, and realized that it might be his lifeline. And so he pushed the window open and prayed in silence—
Devitt: "Dear Goddess, please help me escape from this cage. There are still so many out there waiting for me to make nice hats for them."
Devitt: "I want to be free to make hats for everyone — that's my wish."
Traveler: (Keep listening.)
Devitt: In the instant after he finished his wish, the hat in his hands leaped into the air, suddenly fastening itself to his head.
Devitt: His whole body floated up with that hat and was carried out the window, soaring high over the stunned guards, and over the heavily guarded walls.
Devitt: A rain of arrows pursued him, but they were turned aside gently by the wind. The flabbergasted guards could only watch as the hatmaker flew away from the manse.
Devitt: After that, none would again see that hatmaker in the city. His hat shop was demolished by the frustrated aristocrat.
Devitt: But the hatmaker's good neighbors knew that he was still working to make hats for the people.
Devitt: If one wanted to order a hat from him, you had to do so after midnight, writing your request on the bark of a tree using jam, before placing the bark and the payment for the hat on the highest chimney.
Devitt: Within a week, a beautiful hat bearing the scent of green grass would appear on your windowsill.
Devitt: And that was how everyone came to call him the "Flying Hatter."

Xudi: Why, hello, dear guest! Come and give this Fantastical Fabricator a twist.

### Talk 24 related talk 0

Traveler: About these "Paper Models"...
Xudi: Oh! These paper model designs are based on my friends, who graciously agreed to my requests.
Xudi: See here? This squirrel is modeled after Clanche, who's always nagging me to try flying... And I have! I just, you know, spend more time on the ground than in the air.
Xudi: This toy soldier model is based on Devitt, who loves traveling and making toy models... but loves his hats even more.
Xudi: Last I met him, he was still in Constellation Metropole, tinkering with those hats of his.
Xudi: Ah, and look at this serious, solemn clockwork guard. That's based on Alof.
Xudi: Not the talking type, him, but ever loyal and dutiful. If I remember right, he's been busy training — not that he ever isn't.
Xudi: Ah, my apologies, I'm talking too much, aren't I? Well, activate the Fabricator, if you would.
Xudi: Dewdrops willing, a fine gift you shall receive, and with it the gift of a fine mood.

### Talk 24 related talk 1

Traveler: About the story of the "Good Shelf"...
Xudi: Oh, you'd like to hear the tale, then? Sure. Allow me to briefly introduce this widely-told tale, then.
Xudi: It is said that there was once a kingdom constructed of shelves of many colors.
Xudi: Each shelf had its own duty and objects that they would hold, but there came to be one newly crafted shelf that was dissatisfied.
Xudi: "Why does that shelf get to hold jewelry, and that other hold paintings, while I am consigned to carry expired fruit?"
Xudi: "Enough! I've had enough. I'm leaving this place. I'm going to carry things that truly show my worth!"

Xudi: After that, this shelf embarked on its journey, During this time, he was once the custodian of a wealthy figure's trove of gems and pearls, filling him full, and he also preserved the priceless pieces made by a prominent painter.
Xudi: But when the rich patron passed of an illness, his previous friends did an about-face, seizing all that jewelry for themselves, leaving not a brass bauble behind.
Xudi: And as the artist's inspiration faded and drew great masterworks no longer, his once-vaunted reputation was tarnished.
Xudi: People pilloried him as incompetent, and at last, the agonized artist accomplished arson against all his art, vowing never to paint again.

Xudi: Once the shelf of the wealthy, and of an artist... But now that these things that once filled his life were gone, who was he?
Xudi: Finally, the shelf returned to the kingdom, sequestering himself in the corner of a library, and there lived alone.
Xudi: "I'm a useless shelf," he thought sadly. "Bereft of those jewels and paintings, I am of no worth."

Xudi: But just as the solitude and sorrow were soon to squash his soul, a girl holding books happened by.
Xudi: "Oh my, an empty shelf! What a lifesaver!" So she cried happily. "Dear shelf, could I place these books in your care?"
Xudi: "Of course you may — yet I am a worthless shelf. I do not know if I can even be of help to you," the shelf said sorrowfully.
Xudi: "But... Your frame is large, your boards flat and sturdy." The girl continued, surprised. "No matter how you look at it, you're a good shelf, and you can hold a whole bunch of books."

Xudi: And so the shelf told the girl his story, of how he had once been a guardian of wealth and glory, but that loss and betrayal, too, had come to fill him.
Xudi: And now, he had nothing. He was a valuable shelf no longer.
Xudi: "Dear shelf, why does this matter trouble you so?" The girl laughed. "You've always done your duty, neatly carrying all the things given to you."
Xudi: "Those things are lost, broken, changed, but that has nothing to do with you. You've always been a good shelf."
Xudi: "Taking good care of those things is where your value lies. How could the things you kept define whether you are good or bad?"
Xudi: "So, please, I ask you to do your duty again. Help me take care of these books."
Xudi: "I'll come and sort them every day, and we can discuss this topic more then."
Traveler: (Keep listening.)
Xudi: From that day onward, all the shelves of the kingdom heard that in a certain library, there was a smart, steady, incomparably sound shelf.
Xudi: He would never be happy or anxious because of the value of the things he carried, treasuring everything earnestly.
Xudi: Newly-made shelves would visit him and ask him all manner of questions.
Xudi: And when mentioning him, the new shelves would never fail to address him so—
Xudi: "Ah, you mean that 'Good Shelf'!"

Xudi: And so the shelf told the girl his story, of how he had once been a guardian of wealth and glory, but that loss and betrayal, too, had come to fill him.
Xudi: And now, he had nothing. He was a valuable shelf no longer.
Xudi: "Dear shelf, why does this matter trouble you so?" The girl laughed. "You've always done your duty, neatly carrying all the things given to you."
Xudi: "Those things are lost, broken, changed, but that has nothing to do with you. You've always been a good shelf."
Xudi: "Taking good care of those things is where your value lies. How could the things you kept define whether you are good or bad?"
Xudi: "So, please, I ask you to do your duty again. Help me take care of these books."
Xudi: "I'll come and sort them every day, and we can discuss this topic more then."
Traveler: (Keep listening.)
Xudi: From that day onward, all the shelves of the kingdom heard that in a certain library, there was a smart, steady, incomparably sound shelf.
Xudi: He would never be happy or anxious because of the value of the things he carried, treasuring everything earnestly.
Xudi: Newly-made shelves would visit him and ask him all manner of questions.
Xudi: And when mentioning him, the new shelves would never fail to address him so—
Xudi: "Ah, you mean that 'Good Shelf'!"
Traveler: (Stop listening...)

Traveler: About the Windpath...
Clanche: Well, I did specifically select them for their particular intensity.
Clanche: I believe that one must face the furious flurry without practice or preparation to best hone one's art of flight — to best uncover one's true potential.
Clanche: Flying squirrels nowadays are far too timid! They've utterly forgotten the lessons taught by the "Brave Northerly Wind"!
Clanche: They stand in safe spots and declaim the courage of leaves that dance in the wind, yet are far too frightened to leap into its embrace themselves.
Clanche: How can we protect the kingdom alongside Her Highness if things keep going this way?
Clanche: Shall we merely watch and applaud helplessly as our Princess fights our battles? How risible!
Clanche: It is our duty to defend the kingdom, mastering flight our obligation!
Clanche: The safety of the realm is intimately tied to each and every one of us!
Clanche: Still... Hmph. I wonder if any of my kin will understand these words — they likely think me some obstinate idiot.
Clanche: No matter! Once my techniques have been refined, I shall leave them all speechless.
Clanche: When the time comes, I shall once again tell them of my philosophy.

Traveler: About the "Brave Northerly Wind"...
Clanche: You want to hear the tale? Sure. But first, let me take a moment to put my thoughts together. This story is well-known in our kingdom, and there have been many spins on the narrative...
Clanche: But most begin this way: "A long, long time ago, there was a band of northerly winds learning to blow across all things..."
Clanche: Amongst those northerly winds, there was one who was especially timid. Whenever he blew across the land, he was always scared stiff.
Clanche: "I blew the flowers down, blustered the leaves a-blister... and swept hats off the heads of passersby... My goodness, I even left that lovely lake all a-stir!"
Clanche: Days passed, years went by, this north wind never again dared to blow forth, and the land he was charged with fell into an awkward, windless torpor.

Clanche: And so, his friends, the flying squirrels, came to him and asked, "Why do you never come out anymore? Have you fallen ill?"
Clanche: The north wind said sadly, "I've ruined everything! I've brought nothing but sadness and sorrow, and the ruination of such good things..."
Clanche: "No you haven't!" His friends cried out in surprise. "You've helped us soar into the skies. You've carried rainwater to distant places, and delivered petals and seeds to their places!"
Clanche: "I know. This is my duty... But I want to avoid the mistakes I make." He shook his head. "There must be a better way to finish my job — better than what I'm doing now."

Clanche: His friends looked at each other, knowing that the north wind was shrouded in self-doubt and anxiety. But for their friend's sake, they needed to come up with something.
Clanche: And so they told the north wind to blow upon them once more as he pleased — that this time, they'd take care of everything on the ground.
Clanche: And thus the saddened north wind set out, still half-mired in doubt. Once more did he blow across the plains, through the forests, and over the lakes.
Clanche: As he looked down, he saw his friends waving at him. All was in order, with not the slightest spot of a mess.
Clanche: Only then did the north wind see clearly that the petals he had blown away were filled with tiny seeds, and that new shoots could grow only after the withered yellow leaves had been blown down.
Clanche: And as for that hat... Well, if nothing else, it succeeded in warning the rushing gentleman that the weather had shifted, and with it, so should his choice of clothes.

Clanche: When he returned to his dwelling, the north wind expressed gratitude to his friends. Without their support, he surely would have caused a disaster.
Clanche: But they just laughed, saying that they hadn't done anything differently from before.
Clanche: The north wind had so wished for perfection that the slightest mistake would all but blind him.
Clanche: Yet mistakes are normal. Nothing is truly perfect.
Clanche: A north wind seeking to carry out its duty should never have been so focused on avoiding making any mistakes at all.

Clanche: Instead, he should have worked hard toward his true goal: to help plants sow seeds far afield, to lift the burden from the backs of trees, to carry rainwater along, and to remind people to perhaps wear a layer or two less.
Clanche: Only a north wind who completes their work in such a manner might be called brave.
Traveler: Does this story have anything to do with what you were saying before?
Clanche: It is absolutely related! It is fear of "mistakes" that holds the flying squirrels of our kingdom back from flight.
Clanche: They fear being embarrassed, fear missteps, fear accidentally crashing into something... Just like how the north wind was terrified of blowing it.
Clanche: Absolutely ridiculous! The only thing they should fear is the inability to master flight!
Clanche: *sigh* I really should've made them re-read "Brave Northerly Wind"... You know what? I should just print some new copies and hand them out.
Traveler: That sounds like a different kind of courage.
