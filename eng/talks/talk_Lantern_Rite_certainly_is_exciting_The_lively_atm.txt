Freki: Lantern Rite certainly is exciting. The lively atmosphere sure is different from the festivals that we have back in Mondstadt.
Freki: However, gourmets such as my brother and I do not revel in festivities and excitement. No, it is the delectable food and rare festival snacks we're after.
Freki: I heard that the special dish for this year's Lantern Rite is Grilled Tiger Fish, but after trying some myself, it seems like just ordinary Grilled Tiger Fish that you can get anytime.
Freki: Perhaps only locals can distinguish the subtle variation in flavor?
Freki: Oh, never mind. I'll just try some other snacks instead...
