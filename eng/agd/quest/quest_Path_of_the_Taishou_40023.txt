# Path of the Taishou

Shiki Taishou: Traveler, Paimon!
Shiki Taishou: I explained the situation to the Tenryou Commission and showed them the original documentation. In the end, they believed that the Mystic Onmyou Chamber and I were innocent.
Paimon: Awesome! Does that mean you can start to focus on your original assignment again?
Shiki Taishou: That's right. I've also restored the Mystic Onmyou Chamber to its original state â€” a domain dedicated to honing martial prowess.
Shiki Taishou: With time, this Domain may exhaust itself of charm magic. When that time comes, I will let it lie dormant so that power can gradually reaccumulate.
Shiki Taishou: Now might be a good time to give it a try. Are you up for the challenge?
Traveler: I'm ready!
Paimon: Yeah! Count Paimon in!
Traveler: Bring it on!
