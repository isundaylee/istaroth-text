Traveler: Why can't I just work here?
Gou San'er: What? You're a new temp laborer, here to pick up odd jobs? Ha, then you're out of luck...
Gou San'er: Other than watching the door and stock maintenance, the main task here is just transporting goods.
Gou San'er: Hauling cargo between the docks and the warehouse ain't easy, and normally, we give all the daytime jobs to our comrades at the docks who've been formally employed there for years.
Gou San'er: Temp workers like you only get the night jobs. If you can't finish, someone else'll take care of it later.
Gou San'er: But a new guy joined our crew recently. Tall, strong, and he even wears red horns on his head! Works like a demon, he does.
Gou San'er: He just doesn't get tired â€” does the work of three men, even! He only has to work three hours per night to earn a decent amount of Mora.
Gou San'er: He's pretty reasonable, too. He explained everything when he arrived, saying that he's been pretty strapped for cash recently and is only gonna work like this for a few days. He won't be sticking around, so we won't need to worry about losing our jobs to him in the long term.
Gou San'er: So if you wanna work the night shifts and pick up work while he's around, there won't be much left for you.

Gou San'er: Put it like this. See them boats out in the harbor? Big ones, little ones, don't matter if they's comin' or goin'... Well, all the goods and all the drinking water they have on board goes through this here warehouse. So yes, it's a big deal!
Gou San'er: And with me here to keep an eye on things, I can guarantee you it's also the safest warehouse in the world!
Gou San'er: The rocks this place is built from, believe you me... they ain't gonna budge come hell or high water. Safety guaranteed! You're a traveler, right? Must have seen the world? Tell me, have you been to Sumeru?
Gou San'er: I hear the warehouses they've got over there are nothing more than straw huts! You tryin' to tell me that's safe!? Well lemme tell you something! If you had four of me guarding it, then yeah! It would be safe!

## Talk 4

Gou San'er: Managing this warehouse is my life's work. I keep my eye on the Mingxiao Lantern all the time.
Gou San'er: I make sure that everyone's donations get put to use: every sheet of paper, every strand of lamp wick, every chunk of Plaustrite...
Gou San'er: ...Oi, you! No belts! Belts don't work as lamp wicks, moron! Fetch it back from the pile, please.
