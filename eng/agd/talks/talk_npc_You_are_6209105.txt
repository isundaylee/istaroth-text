Traveler: You are...?
Xiuhua: I'm Yu— Xiuhua! One of the waiting staff here at the Baiju Guesthouse. If there's anything you need, please don't hesitate to ask me!
Traveler: Who are you really?
Xiuhua: ...Wha— Why would you say that!? I mean... how did you notice...
Xiuhua: Hehehe, I'm actually Xiuhua's twin sister, Yuhua. When life is dull and boring, you've got to take the opportunities that being a twin gives you to spice things up a bit...
Xiuhua: Also... Please keep all this to yourself! Pretty please!
