The Steambird: "Masterful Gambit! Honored Citizen Cracks Case!"
The Steambird: Recently, Fontaine's newest Honored Citizen Monsieur Volonte Nouvelle, known by the moniker the "Crowbar Sleuth," managed to reach new heights, using naught but his crowbar and ingenuity to arrest a wanted fugitive and a thief.
The Steambird: He himself continues to insist that he merely provided token assistance. However, we have obtained the truth from both eyewitnesses and the Maison Gardiennage.
The Steambird: As it transpired, the Crowbar Sleuth had in fact already cracked the fugitive's plot, and was ready and waiting to ambush the fiendish criminal. The appearance of the thief simply gifted him with the perfect opportunity to execute his arrests.
The Steambird: Out of awe and respect for him, some citizens have already formed a Crowbar Sleuth Fanclub, and have carried crowbars out with them onto the streets. A fever for Crowbar Sleuth justice is sweeping the city!
