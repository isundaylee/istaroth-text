# Friendships, Wishes, and Regrets


## Talk 1

Paimon: Are we really going with Hu Tao's plan?
Paimon: At least by keeping things low-key, we won't be giving anyone nightmares.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Uhh... Hi... Eh-he... Do you remember us?
Little Wu: Ugh, you... Sorry, I won't be needing the funeral parlor's services anytime soon.
Traveler: Meng told us his story.
Little Wu: Yes, we grew up together. We still keep in touch even now.
Little Wu: I don't know why he started working for Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. To be honest, I find their director to be quite peculiar.
Little Wu: But he must've had his reasons. He's on his own now after all, and he still can't get over what happened to Big G.
Little Wu: Did he tell you about it?
Paimon: Yeah, he did. Um, if you could pick one thing to give to Big G as a keepsake, what would you choose?
Paimon: ...Just, y'know, theoretically speaking. We're just being hypothetical here, definitely not gonna actually go commemorate him or anything...
Traveler: (That's a little bit on the nose.)
Little Wu: I...
Little Wu: I'd cook something for him. He could eat spicy food like no other. His favorite meal was extra-spicy Jueyun Chili Chicken.
Little Wu: I can make it for you if you bring me some Jueyun Chilis.
Little Wu: I'm sure he'd appreciate the flavor of his childhood years. I still use that old recipe.
Paimon: Deal! Just give us a minute!
Traveler: (Typical Paimon...)
Traveler: Meng said that he's an old friend of yours.

## Talk 3

Little Wu: Jueyun Chilis are a common sight in Liyue. I can rustle that dish up in no time if you help me find some.

## Talk 4

Little Wu: Great, this should be enough.
Little Wu: I'll get started on the Jueyun Chili Chicken. I guess you've got other folks to track down?
Little Wu: When everyone's ready, I'll get the dish over to ya.
Paimon: Great! See ya later!
Paimon: (Uh... How did he know about the others...?)

## Talk 5

Mumu: Ugh... not you again. I told you, I'm not interested in the inner workings of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
Paimon: Meng told us about you. You're good friends, right?
Mumu: That's true, yes. Come to think of it, I remember he did join Wangsheng Funeral Parlor recently.
Mumu: It didn't take long for his good friends to figure out why... The Big G incident.
Mumu: But I know there's nothing we can say to help him get over it. Letting go of the past is a painful process. I would know...
Mumu: So, is Big G the reason you're here to see me?
Paimon: How did you know!? We didn't even say anything.
Mumu: Haha, I'm a businessman. I've got a sixth sense for this kind of thing!
Mumu: Everyone hears the name "Mumu" and thinks I must be dim-witted. I never heard the end of it when I set up shop. But... I'd say I've proved a few people wrong.
Mumu: Here, take this. It's a top-of-the-line toy box we all dreamed of owning as kids. Back then, none of us could afford it... We were penniless.
Mumu: Today, business is booming. I ended up buying loads of these. It was a dream come true.
Paimon: Wow, you must be like, super rich...
Mumu: Haha... For me, it's a memento of a childhood long gone. Without it, we wouldn't be where we are today.
Mumu: So, having found me, I guess you'll be looking for Little Wu and Congzi next?
Paimon: Mm-hmm! We already saw Little Wu, now we gotta find Congzi.
Mumu: I see. If it's Congzi you're after, let's meet at the overpass at Feiyun Slope. It's just above the staircase leading down to the dock.
Mumu: I've got an errand to run. I'll come find you as soon as I'm done.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Eh? You're all here?
Little Wu: Reminiscing about old times, thinking back to past events... We've been at it for years.
Mumu: Our hometown was completely destroyed in a disaster, so we've got nowhere to go back to. Now, home is wherever friends are.
Congzi: They've just been telling me you're looking for keepsakes?
Congzi: I make artisan Xiao Lanterns down by Liyue Harbor. I guess they represent me better than anything.
Congzi: A few days ago, I bought some quality Plaustrite Shards. They're currently all in the warehouse at the dock.
Congzi: I've already spoken to the manager. Could I ask you to retrieve them for me?
Paimon: Seems like you already know what's going on! Be back in a jiffy.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Hi, we're here to pick up the Plaustrite Shards for Congzi!
Gou San'er: ...I think she mentioned it... Yes, here you are in the register. No problem.
Gou San'er: The Plaustrite Shards are over in that crate there. Please, help yourselves.

## Talk 8

Mumu: Y'know, I just realized... mine's the only item that's been outright purchased. Yours are both handmade.
Little Wu: But yours is worth a lot more.
Congzi: Worth in Mora is not what's important here. These things all played a big part in our childhood.
Congzi: They show that we will never forget our promise.

## Talk 9

Paimon: We've got everything we need. Let's go to Wuwang Hill and find Hu Tao and the others.
