Traveler: I spot some people trying to catch Mekafish...
Damestier: Oh, that... Technically, that's not fishing, but guiding Mekafish to designated spots with a specialized flashing gadget.
Damestier: It's intended for the regular maintenance of the Mekafish... I still have some here. You can try it out if you're interested.
