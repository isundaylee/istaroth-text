# Autonomous Mechanical Energy Source: Live Sample


## Talk 1

Hosseini: Thanks to the trial data you gathered, the final calibrations to our Pursina's Spikes have been completed.
Hosseini: Now, I can call myself reasonably confident that they will perform as expected.
Hosseini: As long as we place the Spikes in locations that our anomalous model frequents, we should be able to control its power supply.
Hosseini: As long as we can activate the Spikes fully, that machine should be unable to initiate its self-repair protocols.
Traveler: Thank you for your help.
Hosseini: No, no, don't thank me, thank those who came before us and the wisdom that they left behind.
Hosseini: If we did not have that knowledge as our guide, we wouldn't have been able to come up with a way to take that anomalous Ruin Grader down.
Hosseini: All we have done up till now relies on such guiding knowledge, and it is knowledge that is the most valuable resource in the world.
Traveler: Seems complicated.
Hosseini: It's normal to not comprehend this. After all, you have not yet been edified by the supreme wisdom.
Hosseini: ...Hah, look how far I've gone on this tangent. Guess I was too excited at having been able to repair these Pursina's Spikes.
Hosseini: Well, now comes the final phase of our preparations. And by that, I mean that we must place these Spikes on Tsurumi Island.
Hosseini: ...I'm afraid that I shan't be able to help you with that.
Hosseini: According to Inazuma's local laws, people who lack Residence Permits like myself cannot move about freely. As such, this task is up to you, Traveler.
Traveler: Got it.
Hosseini: Thank you. I'd suggest that you not act immediately after placing the Spikes. Instead, quickly check to see if everything is functioning normally, and then check back in with me.
Hosseini: I think we can afford to be a bit more careful for your safety's sake.
Traveler: All hail technology!
Hosseini: Well, not exactly, I think. I would much prefer hailing the knowledge that our predecessors left behind for us to use.

## Talk 2

Hosseini: How did it go? Did the Spikes function as expected?
Traveler: Exactly as planned.
Hosseini: Good, good, that's good. I only hope that it won't break down later, either.
Hosseini: Well then. All we need is for the anomalous Ruin Grader to near the Spikes when we activate them, and it should become cut off from its power supply.
Hosseini: This time, you should be able to defeat it for good, so have at it!
Hosseini: I have faith in your abilities.
