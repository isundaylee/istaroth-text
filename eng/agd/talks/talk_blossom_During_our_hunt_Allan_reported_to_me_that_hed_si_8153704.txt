Draff: During our hunt, Allan reported to me that he'd sighted ores nearby that resembled Crystal Ores...
Draff: Just that they had a different color, and were rarer. You'll have to ask Wagner for the specifics, he probably knows far more than me...
Draff: While Crystal Ores don't fall within the purview of our hunts, I did record their positions. They were somewhere around...
Draff: Mm. I've marked them down on your map. Perhaps that will be of some help to you.
