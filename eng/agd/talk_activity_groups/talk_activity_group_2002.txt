# Talk Activity Group: 2002

## Talk

Ruijin: Hello! Would you like to give Theater Mechanicus a go? It's loads of fun!

## Talk

Ruijin: I'll play a round.
Ruijin: Certainly! You may start whenever you like.

## Talk

Ruijin: What's Theater Mechanicus?
Ruijin: Theater Mechanicus is a new kind of board game that I just invented.
Ruijin: All you need to play is a table, a few game pieces, and a game master.
Ruijin: The objective of the game is to use various strategies to withstand the monster attacks. At least, that's the main idea for now...
Ruijin: But who knows, if any more good ideas come to me, I'd like to expand the game's content even more.
Ruijin: It'd be great to add things like exploring ruins, or solving evil plots... If all goes well, the game could potentially become like a true adventure in another world.

## Talk

Ruijin: How much does it cost to play?
Ruijin: Well, I've only just finished designing this board game and would like to hear what people think of such a game.
Ruijin: So, during the Lantern Rite, it won't cost anyone a single Mora to play. All you need is a Xiao Lantern and you can play one round.
Ruijin: If you'd like to give it a try, just let me know.

## Talk

Ruijin: Goodbye.
Ruijin: Farewell. If you'd like to give Theater Mechanicus a go, just let me know.

## Talk

Xiaoyan: ...an epic fight. Legendary. The skies went black, there were howling winds and waves as high as houses. So the vile demon struck again, this time with all his might... but the adeptus just managed to dodge it! It was a powerful hit indeed; landed square on Mt. Tianheng! Boom!
Traveler: (Keep listening)
Xiaoyan: How powerful was the hit? Try powerful enough to tear open the base of the mountain!
Xiaoyan: "A slight crack in the foundation; what's the big deal," you say? Well, let me tell you. Suddenly, there was a thunderous sound of giant rocks rolling down the mountains: The whole of Mt. Tianheng was on the verge of collapse! Meanwhile, down in the village, everyone stared up at the sight of impending doom and trembled with fear.
Xiaoyan: Skybracer knew that if he didn't act quickly, the entire village was going to be reduced to a pulp! Oh, the humanity...
Traveler: Oh, the humanity!
Xiaoyan: This was it. It was now or never... Suddenly, the adeptus had a brainwave. "Aha! My antlers..."
Xiaoyan: Now. As we all know, the pair of antlers on Skybracer's head were a gift from the Lord of Geo. And what a magnificent gift they were: They were ten feet long and a hundred times harder than the hardest iron you can imagine...
Xiaoyan: That's when he summoned a fellow adeptus.
Xiaoyan: This masked companion was also a formidable fighter. He took a deep breath, and then with one almighty strike from his polearm he tore the antlers clean off the adeptus' head. Crash! They came tumbling to the ground...
Xiaoyan: Skybracer picked the antlers up off the floor. His own antlers. A piece of his very own body. And he thrust them into the foot of Mt. Tianheng! Guess what happened next?
Xiaoyan: It stopped the mountain from falling down — yes... but it also raised the mountain to thousands of feet higher than it had stood before!
Traveler: Wow!
Xiaoyan: ...My friends, do not think of this antler removal as anything remotely similar to a haircut. Antlers are made of bone, and grow straight out of the skull.
Xiaoyan: What was that gushing sound? Blood, spraying out from Skybracer's head like a fountain, coating everything in sight!
Xiaoyan: The adeptus grotesquely wiped his hand across his blood-soaked skull, and began racing back up the mountain to wipe the vile demon off the face of the earth. You can imagine how ferocious he looked now, all covered in blood with murder in his eyes! A great adeptus? More like a king of the demons!
Xiaoyan: Still, to the people who lived below the mountain, Skybracer was their savior, a great and merciful adeptus who had saved them all from certain doom. In fact, they thought more highly of him than they thought of the Lord of Geo.
Xiaoyan: The rain continued to pour down, and the gutters began to swell...
Xiaoyan: But no one really knew how much of it was the rain, and how much was the grateful tears of a rescued people... nor did anyone know how much was the spilled blood of Skybracer...
Traveler: (Stop listening)
Xiaoyan: ...Friends, those antlers; I'm telling you...
Traveler: (Stop listening)
Xiaoyan: How powerful was the hit? I'll tell you...

## Talk

Jingming: Hello, how may I help you?
Traveler: Please tell me about Xiao Lanterns...
Jingming: Xiao Lantern-making is a traditional craft form at Lantern Rite. It's quite technical, you need to cut the paper, insert the wick, add wish sticks, paint it...
Jingming: Sounds like quite an ordeal, huh? Fortunately, if you know how to use a Crafting Bench, it makes things much easier these days.
Jingming: Hopefully, the gods don't think that cheapens the wishes we make.
Jingming: The Crafting Bench is over there. Why not give it a try? The Lantern Rite only comes once a year.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Jingming: May the flames of wisdom spread to all, and never be extinguished.

## Talk

Yi'nian: Ah, a customer! What can I get for you? How about some Lantern Rite specialties? We only make them once a year!
Traveler: I'd like to buy a snack.
Yi'nian: Certainly! Take a look and decide for yourself. I can do anything on the menu. Or if there's something in particular you're after, I can do that instead!
Traveler: How's business these days?
Yi'nian: Haha, business is better than ever. Thanks for asking.
Yi'nian: But if you ask me, making good food is what really counts. Perfecting tasty snacks is time well spent, rather than thinking all day about how to make more advertisements.
Yi'nian: If it's good, it'll sell itself. At least, that's what I think. I don't need any boring advice from Wang'ya.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Yi'nian: Take care. Please come again!

## Talk

Chen the Sharp: All this walking around working up your appetite? Why not curb your hunger with a freshly grilled Tiger Fish?
Chen the Sharp: As it happens, this year's Mingxiao Lantern commemorates Skybracer; back in the day, grilled Tiger Fish was his favorite.
Chen the Sharp: This year's Lantern Rite experience isn't complete until you've tried one!

## Talk

Traveler: I'd like to buy a snack.
Chen the Sharp: You've come to the right place. We've got sizzling hot Grilled Tiger Fish.

## Talk

Traveler: Do you say that every year?
Chen the Sharp: Haha... Yes, I do! I say the same thing every year, but I'm never lying.
Chen the Sharp: It says so in the Historia Naturalis Liyue: a thousand years ago, all the adepti loved eating grilled Tiger Fish...

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Chen the Sharp: If you get peckish when you're browsing around Xiao Market, come and find me!

## Talk

Yi Xian: ...Mommy always used to take us to Xiao Market...
Yi Zhu: Yeah! Mommy would buy toys for us, take us to see the Xiao Lanterns... And she'd carry you when you got tired...
Yi Xian: ...Yi Zhu, I miss Mommy.
Yi Zhu: Yi Xian... Don't cry, let's make a Xiao Lantern for Mommy, shall we?
Yi Xian: Huh? But I thought Xiao Lanterns were to remember the heroes who look after us...
Yi Zhu: You're right. Well, our mommy was a hero and she looked after us, didn't she?
Yi Zhu: So come on, wipe your tears away — let's welcome back Mommy's spirit and all the other heroes with big smiles on our faces!
Yi Xian: Yeah!

## Talk

Yi Zhu: Hi... Are you looking for me?

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Yi Zhu: I'm Yi Zhu. You probably know my little sister, Yi Xian?
Yi Zhu: I promised Yi Xian that we would make a Xiao Lantern together for Mommy, but I couldn't gather the materials we needed. Thankfully, Changshun specially set aside some materials for us to use...
Yi Zhu: Everyone's been so good to me and my sister... *sniff*
Yi Zhu: ...
Yi Zhu: *sniff* ...No, I can't cry... I can't let Yi Xian see me unhappy.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Yi Zhu: Goodbye... May the flames of wisdom spread to all, and never be extinguished.

## Talk

Linlang: Hi, I'm Linlang. I run an antiques shop called Xigu Antiques... How may I help you?

## Talk

Traveler: Please tell me about the Lantern Rite.
Linlang: There's an abiding sense of nostalgia in the air during the Lantern Rite... Normally I only get that feeling in my shop; I love it, it makes me feel so at home.
Linlang: Lantern Rite is much more ancient than any of the antiques in my shop, though.
Linlang: Antiquity has real value. I should know, I make my living off that fact. So make the most of this very precious time of year.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Linlang: Please enjoy this special time filled with the splendor of antiquity.

## Talk

Nervous An: Hi! I'm the Manager of the Maritime Authority, and I'm in a fantastic mood right now!
Nervous An: Mmm, feel that sea breeze... Go on, close your eyes and just feel it for a second... Do you it feel it too?
Nervous An: ...Freedom! Hahahaha!
Nervous An: No more fishing boats and cargo ships trying to get in and out of the harbor; no more application forms and approval forms... For a few days, I can forget all about it!
Nervous An: Praise be to the Lord of Geo!

## Talk

Changchang: I'm Changchang, I just donated Dolly. She's my ragdoll.
Changchang: Last night in my dream, Dolly told me her wish was to fly up into the sky and see the view.
Changchang: So I gave her to the lady over by the big deer lantern. Dolly's wish will come true now, won't it?
Changchang: I did the right thing, didn't I? Wishes are supposed to come true at the Lantern Rite, aren't they?

## Talk

Jiangzhou: May the flames of wisdom spread to all, and never be extinguished.
Jiangzhou: This is the Lantern Rite Gala, where everyone gathers for Lantern Rite. As one of the head planners for the event, is there anything I can assist with?
Traveler: Please tell me about the Lantern Rite.
Jiangzhou: Lantern Rite is an annual festival everyone in Liyue celebrates. It takes place on the night of the first full moon of the year.
Jiangzhou: During the five-day festival, people pray for peace, ward off evil spirits, and watch the lanterns. We believe the fire's light keeps wisdom alive, and guides fallen heroes home along the sea.
Jiangzhou: It's a popular tradition to make the Mingxiao Lantern as well as smaller Xiao Lanterns and then release them into the night sky.
Jiangzhou: The lanterns light the path for the souls of our fallen heroes as they travel by cover of night. We hope the lanterns will guide them back home so they can be reunited with us here.
Jiangzhou: This is an extremely important festival, one which deserves meticulous preparation in every detail. It is my honor to be working as a planner.
Jiangzhou: Please be sure to visit the Xiao Market when you have the chance, that's where the most lively festivities can be found. I hope you thoroughly enjoy yourselves and participate in all the festivities on offer.
Traveler: I'd like to know more about the Lantern Rite traditions.
Jiangzhou: What would you like to know about? There's the Mingxiao Lantern, Xiao Market, as well as the Xiao Lanterns... I'd be happy to tell you all I know.
Traveler: What is the Mingxiao Lantern for?
Jiangzhou: Long, long ago, the heroes and the people joined forces to protect the land of Liyue.
Jiangzhou: Since peace was restored, the tradition of everyone coming together to build a giant floating lantern has been observed as a way of keeping that spirit of unity alive.
Jiangzhou: Everyone who can collects materials, donates what they can spare, and helps with the construction work. And on the final night of the festival, the whole city watches as the lantern is released into the air. It's the tradition most integral to the Lantern Rite.
Jiangzhou: Do you see the huge stone in the middle of the lantern? It's the largest Plaustrite unearthed this year.
Jiangzhou: How big the Mingxiao Lantern is depends on the size of the biggest Plaustrite from the preceding year. This year is special, because it has the biggest chunk of Plaustrite found in twenty years.
Jiangzhou: In honor of the great heroes who died to protect Liyue, the Mingxiao Lantern's design is always based on the adeptus form of one of the heroes.
Jiangzhou: This year's Mingxiao Lantern depicts the noble form of Skybracer. The Yuehai Pavilion chose the theme based on popular demand.
Traveler: What's the Xiao Market?
Jiangzhou: To put it simply, it's one of the attractions for visitors to the festival.
Jiangzhou: A substantial portion of the funding for the Mingxiao Lantern comes from vendors at the market.
Jiangzhou: So although Liyue Harbor's business people can sometimes seem a little tight-fisted, when it comes down to it they're all good people.
Jiangzhou: While everyone's out for the festival, you could certainly talk to them and get to know them a bit.
Traveler: What are Xiao Lanterns?
Jiangzhou: Good question. As you might have guessed, you can't have a Lantern Rite without lanterns!
Jiangzhou: Before releasing it into the air, people will write their wishes on wish sticks and insert them into the lantern. The lantern then carries their wishes off into the night sky.
Jiangzhou: Liyue may be well known for its mining industry, but fortunately, being surrounded by rocks hasn't turned people's hearts to stone...
Jiangzhou: Maybe it's because we also live off the sea. That romantic idea of the gentle sea breeze has found its way into our hearts... Haha.
Jiangzhou: Would you care to try making your own Xiao Lantern? After all, it's not every day you get to be in Liyue during the Lantern Rite.
Traveler: Not right now, thanks.
Jiangzhou: Okay. Well, enjoy your time here.

## Talk

Madame Ping: This year's Mingxiao Lantern is dedicated to Skybracer... He always was a show off — I'm sure he'll be very pleased!

## Talk

Traveler: Who's Skybracer?
Madame Ping: This year's Mingxiao Lantern will be the spitting image of him when it's complete!
Madame Ping: Well, that's the plan. I do hope they make the antlers big enough, they were his pride and joy after all.
Madame Ping: The story goes that the antlers were made from the very essence of Rex Lapis' divine power, which made it the hardest material in all of Liyue.
Madame Ping: But then, that fateful battle happened... The gods exchanged powerful blows, and the mountains started collapsing. To avoid impacting the villagers at the foot of the mountain, the adeptus got his friend to chop his antlers off...
Madame Ping: He used those blood-drenched antlers as a wedge to prop up the mountain. And if that wasn't enough of a sacrifice, he then kept on fighting until his blood was drained and his life ran out...
Madame Ping: Thanks to him, Mt. Tianheng still stands tall and proud to this day. And the blood that he lost in the battle turned into the Bishui River.
Madame Ping: Hehehe... Whether you believe the story or not, I'm just happy that you're willing to hear me tell it.
Madame Ping: Surely, the reason Lantern Rite exists is because people throughout the ages have chosen to come together as friends rather than stay in isolation.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Madame Ping: Goodbye. May the flames of wisdom spread to all, and never be extinguished.

## Talk

Musheng: I'm Musheng, I come from out in the country. There's definitely more of a festive atmosphere in the city.
Musheng: The heroes that we remember during Lantern Rite are actually adepti who lived in Liyue in the distant past.
Musheng: That was a time when the adepti lived among the normal people. I don't know why we never see any adepti nowadays...
Musheng: I can't help but think it's a bad omen... Ah, what am I saying? I shouldn't jinx the festival, should I? Haha.

## Talk

Vlad: H—Hello... Judging from your attire, we must be from the same place, no?
Nadia: Hmm? Ah yes, hello. Sorry, I seldom meet other Snezhnayans around here.
Vlad: The Lantern Rite sure is beautiful, isn't it?
Nadia: Yes, but it seems that there's still much to come yet. The Mingxiao Lantern is the height of the festivities. At least, that's what I've heard.
Vlad: Ah yes, so it seems. I've only just arrived here recently... I've come here alone, so there are still many things I don't quite understand yet.
Nadia: Oh? I've also arrived recently myself, so I often come here alone to watch the ships sail in from Snezhnaya.
Vlad: ...Though I know that these boats rolling in and out of the port are not the ones to take me back home. Huh, what a coincidence... I also often come and watch the boats here.
Nadia: Are you sure we've never met before?
Vlad: Could we have met before? Perhaps my memory is failing me... I apologize, it would be impolite if I've forgotten.
Nadia: No, no, I'm sure we've never met. Though I feel that something is... awfully familiar when I'm speaking with you.
Vlad: Ah, is that so... Well, that's perfectly alright...
Nadia: The Lantern Rite... It sure is beautiful, isn't it?

## Talk

Andrei: This is my first time participating in the Lantern Rite. All in all, the atmosphere of the festivities is quite enjoyable.
Andrei: What fascinates me most though is the Mingxiao Lantern... Who would've thought that the people of Liyue could build a lantern so big.
Andrei: ...Watching the lighting and ascent of the Mingxiao Lantern must certainly be an unforgettable scene for everyone who participates in the Lantern Rite.
Andrei: I'm really starting to enjoy this city... No, no, I must remain loyal to the Tsaritsa...

## Talk

Ivanovich: The glow of the Xiao Lanterns feels so warm...
Ivanovich: Even as a stranger in this foreign city, seeing the brightly lit streets and Xiao Lanterns above in the night sky still brings some indescribable warmth to my heart.
Ivanovich: Such a warm feeling reminds me of our "Krsnik Noc" in Snezhnaya.
Ivanovich: If you ever have the chance, you must visit Snezhnaya and participate in one of our festivals.

## Talk

Yiran: Manager Kuan! I don't want a kite, I want a Xiao Lantern!
Manager Kuan: How many times do I have to tell you, just call me "Daddy."
Manager Kuan: If you want a Xiao Lantern, then we can just release one together. Now, if you want to write a wish on the lantern, just tell me and I'll...
Yiran: No way! Your handwriting is terrible, Manager Kuan. If you write it, our wish will never come true!
Manager Kuan: Ah, child, how could you ever be so cold to your Daddy...
Yiran: But aren't you the one who taught me to always be honest about what's on my mind?
Yiran: And since I know that your handwriting is absolutely terrible, wouldn't I be disobeying if I told you it's fine for you to write?
Manager Kuan: *sigh* Fine, you're right... I'll buy you a lantern... But from now on, you must call me "Daddy."
Yiran: Alright, "Daddy"! Now, Daddy! Do as you promised!

## Talk

Kun: Hey, this is the big day! The annual Lantern Rite is finally here!
Kun: All of Liyue Harbor is already bustling with excitement around us. It's not often that you'll see the city in such a festive state.
Kun: ...But when it comes to Lantern Rite, the Mingxiao Lantern is the moment everyone's waiting for.
Kun: On the final of Lantern Rite, they'll release the Mingxiao Lantern, built by the efforts of all the people of Liyue, and the lantern will slowly ascend into the night sky. It'll be a moment you won't want to miss.
Kun: But I needn't say more. Take a walk around and take in all the festivities for yourself.

## Talk

Linling: The glow of Xiao Lanterns fills the night sky, shedding light on lands below as they fly. The glow upon the sea dances before one's eyes, casting scattered lights as the waves arise...
Linling: Hmm, casting scattered lights? No, no... That's no good! Ah, now I've got it! "flickering endlessly on the tides of night."
Linling: Yes, yes, that's it! So, what do you think of my poem?

## Talk

Traveler: It's great.
Linling: Hehe, I see you have good taste. My poems can set the mood even for an event as grand as the Lantern Rite.
Linling: *sigh* It's a shame that those who truly grasp the subtleties of verse and rhyme are few and far between.
Linling: I once posted my poems all around Liyue Harbor to help bring the spirit of Lantern Rite to the citizens of Liyue.
Linling: ...But before long, I was reported by the Millelith and was told that I would be arrested if I dared to post my poetry again.
Linling: Hmph, those uncultured curs, have they no taste at all!?

## Talk

Traveler: It's okay, I guess...
Linling: Just okay? Then you must certainly be missing the deep creativity and philosophical meaning behind the words!
Linling: ...Hmph, such a shame.

## Talk

Freki: Lantern Rite certainly is exciting. The lively atmosphere sure is different from the festivals that we have back in Mondstadt.
Freki: However, gourmets such as my brother and I do not revel in festivities and excitement. No, it is the delectable food and rare festival snacks we're after.
Freki: I heard that the special dish for this year's Lantern Rite is Grilled Tiger Fish, but after trying some myself, it seems like just ordinary Grilled Tiger Fish that you can get anytime.
Freki: Perhaps only locals can distinguish the subtle variation in flavor?
Freki: Oh, never mind. I'll just try some other snacks instead...

## Talk

Dugu Shuo: Looking for a hero? No... Looking for a mighty hero? I'm your guy.

## Talk

Traveler: Mighty hero?
Dugu Shuo: That's right. Heroes are always commemorated at Lantern Rite.
Dugu Shuo: Hmph, and one day I too shall become a hero that's revered by one and all, I'm certain of it!
Dugu Shuo: Just you wait. By this time next year, crowds will be gathering to light lanterns for me, hehe...
Traveler: But this is the festival for remembering fallen heroes.
Dugu Shuo: Huh? You mean they don't commemorate you unless you're dead?
Dugu Shuo: You're joking, right? I—I don't believe you!
Dugu Shuo: W—Well then, never mind about next year's Lantern Rite...
Dugu Shuo: In 50 years... No, in 100 years, everyone will remember this mighty hero during Lantern Rite!

## Talk

Traveler: Never mind.
Dugu Shuo: Well then don't waste my time. I've got much to do yet on my journey to becoming a mighty hero.

## Talk

Jiayi: While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail.
Jiayi: Have you released a Xiao Lantern yet? If you write a wish on the lantern, it's bound to come true someday.
Jiayi: For example, my wish was that my daughter Little Liu would live a peaceful and healthy life, and that she'd make many friends, haha.
Jiayi: ...Perhaps you'll even be able to see the sky filled with Xiao Lanterns from atop the hills of Qingce Village.
Jiayi: *sigh* Little Liu... Your daddy misses you so much...

## Talk

Changshun: For some reason, I feel that this year's Lantern Rite will be particularly magnificent.
Changshun: I was originally planning to stock up on extra materials for making Xiao Lanterns and resell them for a profit during Lantern Rite.
Changshun: But just as I was about to purchase the materials, I found out that Ningguang had instated laws against price gouging on Xiao Lantern materials.
Changshun: If it weren't for Ningguang, I might have never realized what a shameful business scheme that was.
Changshun: So given that I couldn't make any money on the materials anyway, I decided to just give my remaining Xiao Lantern materials to Yi Zhu and Yi Xian.
Changshun: I hope that they will enjoy a lovely Lantern Rite this year.

## Talk

Traveler: What are you looking at?
Brother Qian: Me? Oh, I'm trying to figure out how to set this thing up...
Brother Qian: Which way were these lamps supposed to go... I can't remember...

## Talk

Traveler: I'd like to try the Illumiscreen.
Brother Qian: ...Again? Sorry, you'll need to wait until I've got the new lanterns ready.
