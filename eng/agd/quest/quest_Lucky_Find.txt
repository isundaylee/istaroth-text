# Lucky Find


## Talk 1

Olaf: Brr... So, so c—cold...
Xiangling: He's shivering! We need to warm him up, quick!
Paimon: Make a fire!
Xiangling: Hot soup would be even better.
Xiangling: #Traveler, how about I look after him while you make him a *nice warm bowl of soup*?
Xiangling: We passed a hilichurl camp on the way here. There'll almost certainly be a campfire there to cook on.
Traveler: Sure.
Xiangling: Great. Be as quick as you can!

## Talk 2

Olaf: Mmm... That is better... That is better...
Olaf: Thank you. That soup really did the trick.
Traveler: What happened, did you get frozen?
Olaf: Yes. I was chasing a boar, and after chasing him all this way he slipped into those underground ruins over there.
Olaf: I followed him inside, but ran into a Cryo Regisvine.
Olaf: It froze me instantly. When I woke up I ran straight outside, but... I only made it this far before my strength failed me.
Xiangling: Cryo Regisvine? Vines... attack people?
Olaf: They do now! I'd heard of them before from others, but this was the first time seeing one with my own eyes.
Paimon: Yikes, we should definitely keep our distance from the ruins... It sounds dangerous.
Xiangling: It sounds delicious!
Traveler: ...Seriously?
Xiangling: That's it! The missing ingredient! The icing on the cake!
Paimon: Calm down. Can we really eat a tree that's that aggressive?
Xiangling: Only one way to find out — let's go!
Paimon: *sigh* Off she goes again...
Traveler: We need to go.
Olaf: Do not worry about me, I'll be fine. But you must stop her, she is putting herself in grave danger.
Traveler: You should get back to Springvale.
Traveler: Does anything NOT make you think about food?
