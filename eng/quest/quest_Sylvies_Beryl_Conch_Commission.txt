# Sylvie's Beryl Conch Commission


## Talk 1

Traveler: About Beryl Conches...
Sylvie: Ah! My submission to "Tales of Humanity" has been answered! Yes, that's right, I am collecting them.
Sylvie: You've already prepared all the Beryl Conches I requested, haven't you?
Traveler: Beryl Conches are ready.
Traveler: Not yet.
Sylvie: No problem, come and find me once you've got them. I'm usually at work here.

## Talk 2

Sylvie: Wonderful, thank you! Beryl Conches are both quaint and elegant. Simply the best home decoration to be found anyway.
