## Talk

Dori: #Hello, Traveler. If you'd like to speak with me, then you'll have to cough up some Mora first.
Dori: Just kidding, just kidding! Hehe, I just wanted to see how you'd react, that's all.

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Dori: Ahem, well, even though it's nothing compared to the Palace of Alcazarzaray...
Dori: I suppose it could suffice as my backup base. It'll do.
Traveler: "It'll do"? C'mon, it's gotta be better than that...
Dori: Puh-lease, merely receiving a compliment from the wise and mighty Lord Sangemah Bay...
Dori: Is already high praise indeed!
Dori: You're certainly a cut above the average artless toadstool!
Dori: But, if the knowledgeable Lord Sangemah Bay is to serve as a renovation consultant for this place...
Dori: You'll need some Mora, a LOT of Mora...
Dori: No rush, though. I'm sure you'll save enough Mora... someday.
Dori: I suppose I might stay here a little longer, now that there's an opportunity to earn big Mora, hehe.
Traveler: How do I take it from "It'll do" to "It's amazing"?
Dori: Oh? You mean... you mean, what'll it take for it to beat the Palace of Alcazarzaray as my primary base?
Dori: Wow, good to see my young apprentice show some ambition for once.
Dori: Really, I'm impressed!

## Talk

Traveler: Want to chat?
Dori: I most certainly would!
Dori: The question is, have you brought enough Mora?
Traveler: Uh, why are you so obsessed with Mora?
Dori: Well, first and foremost, I'm a merchant.
Dori: Second, Mora is shiny, round, and mesmerizing!
Dori: And third, only if you truly adore Mora will it always come running your way.
Dori: So, work hard and cherish every Mora you make.
Dori: That way, I can stay by your side and keep earning Mora from you forever.
Dori: Well, whaddya waiting for? Get out there and chase that Mora!
Traveler: Why do you want to make so much Mora?
Dori: Because Mora is the loveliest thing in the whole world!
Dori: And I don't want to lose anything precious to me again due to a lack of Mora... Never again...
Dori: Ahem, anyway, Mora can solve most of life's problems.
Dori: And if you ever find a problem that Mora can't fix, just try doubling the amount you're offering!

## Talk

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Dori: Yeah, let's work together and make a big, shiny, golden statue and place it out where everyone can see!
Traveler: So is this your recommendation as my new "renovation consultant"?
Dori: That's right. I've been thinking about what this place is lacking...
Dori: And then it hit me. What's missing is more shiny gold! Hehe!
Traveler: In that case... why don't we make a golden Dori statue?
Dori: Well, if you really insist!
Dori: But maybe we should wait until you can afford the rights to use my image.
Dori: For now, we can start with a simple Mora sculpture!
Dori: Because this place could potentially serve as my base, naturally, it should be to my liking!
Dori: #But let's get one thing straight: This is a collaboration between Traveler and the eminent Lord Sangemah Bay.
Dori: So you better bring your best to the project.
Dori: I prepared all the tools and raw gold a few days ago. Anyway, I'll cover the expenses this time, as long as you perform the labor!
Traveler: Wait... You'll cover the expenses?
Dori: Okay okay, enough idle chitchat.
Dori: Come talk to me when you're ready to get to work.
Traveler: Did I hear that right?
Traveler: How about... we make a shiny, golden Mora sculpture?
Dori: Haha, at long last, my tastes are beginning to rub off on you, my young apprentice!
Dori: Alright, we'll make a Mora sculpture!

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Dori.
Dori: Good morning, my young apprentice.
Dori: A successful day starts with the morning. That Mora's not gonna earn itself, after all.
Dori: So c'mon, let's get moving!

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Dori.
Dori: Good night, my young apprentice.
Dori: I hope you have a nice dream filled with shiny Mora.

Dori: Ho-ho, nothing can compare to my darling Mora, but the gemstones here are beautifully lustrous.
Dori: The longer you spend in my company, the more astute your tastes grow, my apprentice. How very wonderful.
Dori: I, the magnanimous Lord Sangemah Bay, have decided that I will be staying here for a little longer. No need to thank me â€” I know you must feel honored, and that's enough for me.

## Talk

Dori: Aha, now this is my kind of environment. And look at this discerning arrangement of shops.
Dori: I'm impressed, my young apprentice. Perhaps you're more of a business genius than I realized?
Dori: The next time that I, the renowned Lord Sangemah Bay, am negotiating a major business deal, make sure you come along.
