Traveler: The young lady?
Baharak: Well, she's a nice person. She helped me out when I was lost in the desert.
Baharak: When we first met, I was in shambles. She didn't recognize me in my green adventurer suit. She took me back to the village and gave me food and water after I explained to her what happened.
Baharak: And after that... I bothered her several times, hehe.
Baharak: So if you're in danger in the desert, head to Aaru Village for help.
Baharak: She has a different color in each eye. You'll know at the sight of her.
