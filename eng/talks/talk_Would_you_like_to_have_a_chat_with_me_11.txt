Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?

Beidou: Sure! I'm down to chat about anything!
Beidou: But, you must be a little weary of hearing about my sea travels from all the stories people tell?
Beidou: Let's change it up! Tell me about your adventures!
Traveler: Um... I fought a dragon once.
Beidou: Whoa, nice! How big was it?
Beidou: Hahaha, incredible!
Beidou: So I fought a sea dragon, and you fought a sky dragon.
Beidou: If we went adventuring together, we'd be invincible!
Traveler: Most of them involve fighting hilichurls...
Beidou: How's that? I certainly don't see many of those out at sea!
Beidou: But adventure isn't just about how many storms you've survived in the past â€” it's about knowing that there are plenty more storms up ahead, and you don't know what they've got in store for ya!
Beidou: Hey, that sounded pretty profound now that I think about it...
Beidou: Haha, this was a great chat! And now, a toast! Cheers!
Traveler: Probably bigger than your ship.
