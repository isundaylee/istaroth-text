Chiori: The design of this lantern is exquisite... Definitely worth the trip.
Traveler: Chiori, this gift envelope is for you.
Chiori: Oh, for me? Thank you.
Chiori: Ah... Lovely detail around the border. Looks like you put a lot of care into this â€” thank you, I'll take good care of it.
Chiori: By the way, do you know who designed this lantern?
Chiori: It's beautiful, and the way the light shines through is so imaginative.
Chiori: I wonder if the design took inspiration from some of Liyue's ancient legends... I feel like I've seen similar patterns in a book before.
Chiori: I'd love to speak with the person who made it. I might even get some ideas for a new collection along the way...
Chiori: Alright, I'm going to ask around.
Traveler: See you.
Chiori: Take care.
