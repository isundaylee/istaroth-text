Kurosawa Kyounosuke: What? You're looking for me?

## Talk

Traveler: Hello...?
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: Yeah.

## Talk

Traveler: You seem to be...
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: Seem to be what, exactly?
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: Depressed? Well, then you're pretty close.
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: Ever since I lost my Vision, it feels like most of the things in this world don't mean anything to me anymore.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye...
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: Mm.

## Talk

Kurosawa Kyounosuke: It's you! It's been a while.

## Talk

Traveler: It has. How are you doing?
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: Me... Ah, I don't even know where to begin.
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: I don't think I will ever recover my lost memories. But when I hold the sword my father gave me, I can still feel the traces of my past wishes...
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: Can I truly walk the path of righteousness once again?

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: Goodbye! Have a safe journey.

## Talk

Traveler: As for your Vision?
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: It was confiscated due to the Vision Hunt Decree. It's nothing special really, it happened to others too.
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: As for my opinion on the Vision Hunt Decree... Now? I don't have an opinion anymore.
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: Then, some people reported that I had been slacking off at work due to my discontent with the Vision Hunt Decree... And you saw what happened.
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: I can't remember what my opinions were like before... And I don't really care about them anymore.

## Talk

Traveler: It's been a while. How are you doing?
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: Once the Vision Hunt Decree was abolished, my Vision was returned to me. Every time I hold the sword that my father gave me, I can feel the embers of my past wishes start to burn again...
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: It seems that I will walk this path of righteousness once more after all...

## Talk

Traveler: It'll work out for sure.
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: If you put it like that, then... I'll try my best.
Kurosawa Kyounosuke: The things that my father has taught me, I haven't forgotten them. Let us encourage each other in our walk down the road of life.
