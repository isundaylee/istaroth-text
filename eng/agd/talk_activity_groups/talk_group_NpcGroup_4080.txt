Gurgen: Hello, do you need medicinal herbs?

## Talk

Traveler: Medicinal herbs?
Gurgen: My father was a herb farmer. After I survived a shipwreck, I came home to help grow herbs.
Gurgen: I was unable to go to sea due to the aftereffects of that shipwreck, so I reapplied for knowledge on growing herbs from the Akasha Terminal.
Gurgen: I survived only because of the immediate first aid. It was natural for me to support my father when he decided to provide herbs for Bimarstan for free.
Gurgen: If possible, I want to pass the examination to study medicine at the Akademiya.

Gurgen: I won't be able to go out to sea ever again, but if I can, I'd like to go to Pardis Dhyai.
Gurgen: I've heard that a lot of talks there have gone public. Who knows, a bit of herb lore there and an exam here, and you'll see me next at the Akademiya studying the medical sciences!
