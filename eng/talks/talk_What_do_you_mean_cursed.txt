Traveler: What do you mean "cursed..."?
Perplexed Treasure Hunter: I'm not sure how it came to be, but the whole place is shrouded in a cursed fog. Even those with a Vision are only able to stay a short while before being forced out.
Perplexed Treasure Hunter: With that said, <color=#00E1FFFF>the chests here</color> are said to contain items that will help you to resist the fog's curse and <color=#00E1FFFF>increase your time in the maze</color>! Some of the chests being guarded by monsters can only be opened <color=#00E1FFFF>after the monster is defeated</color>. If you're going to give it a go, make sure to <color=#00E1FFFF>pay attention to the time</color>!
