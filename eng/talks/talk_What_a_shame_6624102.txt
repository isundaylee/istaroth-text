Ohtli: ...What a shame...
Itotia: Stop, stop!
Ohtli: ...Another draw.
Itotia: You just have to fight me, don't you?
Ohtli: The day you beat me, I'll shut up for as long as you want.
Ohtli: But until then, I'll speak my mind.
Itotia: ...The day will come. So long as we're both standing here breathing, the day will come when we find out who the winner is!
Itotia: Not only am I going to make you shut up, I'm gonna make you take off that mask! And then we'll see whether you're wearing it because of all the scars underneath.
Ohtli: That'll depend on how good you are. Try killing half an enemy more than me, for starters.
