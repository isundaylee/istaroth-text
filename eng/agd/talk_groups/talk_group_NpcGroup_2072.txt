Ivanovich: I believe these documents should be in order...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Ivanovich: Oh, so it's you. Well, you've seen what happened in Liyue Harbor earlier, yes? It gave us all quite the fright.
Ivanovich: I thought the city might be in a mess for a while longer, but order was restored very quickly. The Liyue Qixing are quite something, indeed.
Ivanovich: But whether it was to stabilize the situation or otherwise, the Ministry of Civil Affairs has released a whole slew of new bulletins and regulations.
Ivanovich: I wish to continue doing business here, so I've been out and about these few days, trudging my way through a deluge of paperwork, administrative procedures, and submitting all the applications that the regulations require.
Ivanovich: But Clerk Zhao said that I also need to apply for a new business permit, and told me to stay tuned for any more announcements.
Ivanovich: I've been running around for several days now. There are a few procedures I've yet to finish, but I really don't have any energy left to spare to check the bulletins.
Ivanovich: Traveler, could you please help me check the Bulletin Board and see if there's any news on the new business permits?

## Talk

Traveler: I've got it.
Ivanovich: Thank you so much. I'm sorry... I'm just all tuckered out right now.
Ivanovich: I know it's not far to walk, but administrative work always makes me feel doubly exhausted...
Ivanovich: If you see any news related to the new business permits, copy them down and pass them to me. I'm counting on you.

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry, but I have other things to do right now.
Ivanovich: I understand. You must have many things on your plate as well. I'll rest for a while... and then I'll go settle this myself.

## Talk

Traveler: Why's it so chilly here?
Ivanovich: You too? Aha, so it's not just me, after all...
Ivanovich: I'm wearing plenty of layers, but somehow I'm so cold that I can't stop shivering. Let me see what's going on...
Ivanovich: Aha! Turns out I had this stone in my pocket all along. Hmm, must have slipped in there somehow while I was back home...
Ivanovich: Hmm? Piqued your curiosity, has it? Well, it's not classed as ore, and I certainly can't sell it here... So, I may as well let you have it.

## Talk

Ivanovich: Good day, my friend! My apologies, but I am out of stock at the moment. Please try again next time.

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you...?
Ivanovich: I am Ivanovich, pleasure to meet you! I am a businessman from Snezhnaya. I am now waiting for my next delivery.
Ivanovich: The people of Liyue are very wealthy! I import goods from Snezhnaya and everything sells out almost as soon as it arrives.
Ivanovich: If I had known sooner, I would have opened my own store here so I could sell directly to consumers. That way I would not have to oversee the deliveries myself.

## Talk

Traveler: What do you sell?
Ivanovich: Technically I am a distributor, selling everyday items produced in Snezhnaya. As well as that, I also act as an agent for Cor Lapis merchants selling to Snezhnayan factories.
Ivanovich: The Qixing have been keeping a close eye on Snezhnaya's senior officials recently...
Ivanovich: Some people say that the only reason we are able to buy Cor Lapis from Liyue merchants is because they were mediating behind the scenes...
Ivanovich: But I am not privy to the details. So please excuse me from withholding judgment.
Ivanovich: Although our goods are produced in high quantities, they are by no means cheap.
Ivanovich: So I have a high opinion of Liyue consumers... Their spending always exceeds our projections.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Ivanovich: Take care. Hope to see you again when we are fully stocked.
