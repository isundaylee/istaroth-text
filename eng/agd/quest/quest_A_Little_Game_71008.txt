# A Little Game


## Talk 1

Childish Jiang: So bored... Need someone to play with...
Traveler: What are you up to?
Childish Jiang: Mom and dad don't have time to come home and play with me, so I have to play here all by myself. But it's so boring playing with only one person...
Childish Jiang: Also, I can't stray too far from home, otherwise mom and dad wouldn't be able to find me when they got back, and then they'd start worrying.
Childish Jiang: Do you wanna play with me? We can play hide-and-seek, it's really easy, anyone can play it.

## Talk 2

Childish Jiang: My hiding place is in the *south*. Do you wanna carry on playing hide-and-seek with me?

## Talk 3

Childish Jiang: My hiding place is *next to the cliff in the south*. Do you wanna carry on playing hide-and-seek with me?

## Talk 4

Childish Jiang: Ah, you found me! Was it that obvious?
Traveler: It was pretty obvious...
Childish Jiang: Really? How could that be? When I hid here, even my father couldn't find me...
Childish Jiang: Hmph. We've only just begun. I haven't used my full power yet!

## Talk 5

Childish Jiang: Hee-hee, see? Told you you'd never find me, didn't I!
Childish Jiang: Well, since it's your first time playing, I'll give you a little clue.
Childish Jiang: I'm hiding *behind a rock*. You just gotta a look a little harder! You wanna carry on playing?

## Talk 6

Childish Jiang: Still can't find me?
Childish Jiang: Seems like I'm pretty good at this! Hmm... Maybe I should go easier on you.
Childish Jiang: I'm hiding *to the north*. You just gotta a look a little harder! You wanna carry on playing?

## Talk 7

Traveler: Actually, I need a break.

## Talk 9

Childish Jiang: My hiding place is *behind a rock*. Do you wanna carry on playing hide-and-seek with me?

## Talk 10

Traveler: I need a break.

## Talk 11

Childish Jiang: Ah, you found me!
Childish Jiang: Hee-hee, was I well hidden or what? This is my secret hiding place. Even Mommy can't find me here!
Traveler: That tree doesn't hide you completely.
Childish Jiang: I don't believe you! I'm tiny and this tree hides me perfectly, even Daddy says so.
Childish Jiang: My dad's really tall and it even hides him. There's no way it could hide him but not me.
Childish Jiang: Anyway, I guess you're just really good at this game. Let's play again!
Childish Jiang: Hmph, this time I'm gonna hide way out of sight. I know just the place, Daddy picked it for me...
Childish Jiang: My daddy's a Millelith, and he says that there's no one better than him at being stealthy.
Childish Jiang: Every time we've played hide-and-seek before, Mommy can never ever find me and Daddy until Daddy comes out on purpose... Or if Mommy yells at him to come out, that works too.

## Talk 12

Childish Jiang: Give up?
Childish Jiang: Hmm... Okay, I'll give you a little clue. This time, I'll be hiding *near one of the trees round here*.
Childish Jiang: Let's have another round, you'll definitely be able to find me this time. Well? You wanna carry on playing?

## Talk 13

Childish Jiang: My hiding place is in the *north*. Do you wanna carry on playing hide-and-seek with me?

## Talk 14

Childish Jiang: My hiding place is near a *big rock to the north*. Do you wanna carry on playing hide-and-seek with me?

## Talk 15

Childish Jiang: My hiding place is *next to one of the trees round here*. Do you wanna carry on playing hide-and-seek with me?

## Talk 16

Childish Jiang: What do you think of my daddy's specially chosen hiding place? Pretty well hidden, right?

## Talk 17

Childish Jiang: Haha, guess you couldn't find me after all?
Childish Jiang: Well, it is a pretty neat hiding place. My daddy found it for me, even Mommy can't find me there.
Childish Jiang: There's no way you can compete with my daddy at this game, so I'll have to give you a clue. My hiding place is *nearby that house over there*.

## Talk 18

Childish Jiang: See, you couldn't find me, right? Haha, well this hiding place was picked by my dad, after all.
Childish Jiang: I'll have to give you a clue, otherwise you'll never find me. So, try heading *east* next time.
Childish Jiang: Let's go again! You can do it, you just need to look a little harder.

## Talk 19

Childish Jiang: My hiding place is in the *north*. Do you wanna carry on playing hide-and-seek with me?

## Talk 20

Childish Jiang: My hiding place is *in a tree on the slope to the north*. Do you wanna carry on playing hide-and-seek with me?

## Talk 21

Childish Jiang: My hiding place is *nearby that house*. Do you wanna carry on playing hide-and-seek with me?

## Talk 22

Childish Jiang: Hmm... Well, this is the ultimate hiding place, I guess.
Childish Jiang: Okay, a hint: I'm hiding *by the cliff*. Look carefully!
Childish Jiang: Let's give it another go.

## Talk 23

Childish Jiang: Still can't find me... Alright, I guess you're allowed another clue.
Childish Jiang: The clue is: Look further *south*.
Childish Jiang: Got it? Let's try again, you should be able to find me this time.

## Talk 24

Childish Jiang: My ultimate hiding place is even better than I thought. Seems like you'll never find me there...
Childish Jiang: Since you're having so much trouble finding me... Try looking by the *big cliff at the south*.
Childish Jiang: Hee-hee... Who knows what you might find there — maybe me!

## Talk 25

Childish Jiang: My hiding place is *to the east*. Do you wanna carry on playing hide-and-seek with me?

## Talk 26

Childish Jiang: My hiding place is *nearby that house to the east*. Do you wanna carry on playing hide-and-seek with me?

## Talk 27

Childish Jiang: My hiding place is *next to the cliff*. Do you wanna carry on playing hide-and-seek with me?

## Talk 28

Traveler: Sure, I love that game!
Childish Jiang: Yay! Alright, let the game begin!
Childish Jiang: Um, but gimme a sec first... I haven't thought where to hide...
Childish Jiang: ...Okay, I got it! Hehehe, you'll never find me!
Childish Jiang: Ready?

## Talk 29

Childish Jiang: So, are you ready?

## Talk 30

Traveler: Sorry, no hiding and seeking for me today...
Childish Jiang: Okay... Guess I'll play alone some more then...

## Talk 31

Childish Jiang: Was I really so well hidden? Hmm, this must be getting pretty boring for you if you can't find me.
Childish Jiang: I'm hiding near a *a big rock to the north*.
Childish Jiang: Alright, let's go again shall we? Surely you'll be able to find me this time.

## Talk 32

Childish Jiang: Let's play again.
Childish Jiang: This time, I'm gonna hide in the best hiding place ever. You'll never find me!

## Talk 33

Childish Jiang: Ah, you finally found me! Was it that obvious?
Traveler: It was pretty obvious...
Childish Jiang: Really? How could that be? When I hid here, even my father couldn't find me...
Childish Jiang: Hmph. We've only just begun. I haven't used my full power yet!

## Talk 34

Traveler: I'm ready!
Childish Jiang: Okay! Uh, on your marks... get ready... let's go!

## Talk 35

Traveler: Sure.

## Talk 36

Childish Jiang: Still couldn't find me? Maybe you're just not very good at this kind of game...
Childish Jiang: Here's a tip: Try looking *further northwest*. I'm hiding over that way.
Childish Jiang: Let's go again. You ready?

## Talk 37

Childish Jiang: Bet you won't find me this time!

## Talk 38

Childish Jiang: ...Have you ever even played this game before?
Childish Jiang: Ugh, it's hopeless... You'll never find me at this rate.
Childish Jiang: Look out for a *tree on the slope to the northwest*.
Childish Jiang: Surely you must be able to find me now... Let's give it another try.

## Talk 39

Traveler: Not just yet...
Childish Jiang: Okay, well you do what you gotta do... and when you're ready, let me know!

## Talk 40

Childish Jiang: Aha, you finally found me.
Childish Jiang: Hee-hee, was I well hidden or what? This is my secret hiding place. Even Mommy can't find me here!
Traveler: That tree doesn't hide you completely.
Childish Jiang: I don't believe you! I'm tiny and this tree hides me perfectly, even Daddy says so.
Childish Jiang: My dad's really tall and it even hides him. There's no way it could hide him but not me.
Childish Jiang: Anyway, I guess you're just really good at this game. Let's play again!
Childish Jiang: Hmph, this time I'm gonna hide way out of sight. I know just the place, Daddy picked it for me...
Childish Jiang: My daddy's a Millelith, and he says that there's no one better than him at being stealthy.
Childish Jiang: Every time we've played hide-and-seek before, Mommy can never ever find me and Daddy until Daddy comes out on purpose... Or if Mommy yells at him to come out, that works too.

## Talk 41

Childish Jiang: Couldn't find me, huh?
Childish Jiang: Don't feel bad — my daddy found the hiding place for me, so normal people would never be able to find it.
Childish Jiang: Here's a tip: Look out for *hidey holes around that house to the east*.
Childish Jiang: As tips go, that was a pretty big one. So surely you should be able to find me now.
Childish Jiang: Let's go again! You can do it, you just need to look a little harder.

## Talk 42

Childish Jiang: Okay, this time I'm gonna go to... my ultimate hiding place! You'll never find me there.

## Talk 43

Childish Jiang: What do you think of my daddy's specially chosen hiding place? Pretty well hidden, right?

## Talk 44

Traveler: It wasn't that hard to find.
Childish Jiang: Really? Well... At least, Mommy can never find me and Daddy when we're hiding here.

## Talk 45

Childish Jiang: You found me! Hehehe...

## Talk 46

Childish Jiang: You found me! Hehehe...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: It was pretty hard to find.
Childish Jiang: See? See? Whenever me and Daddy hide here, Mommy can never find us and always has to tell us to come out.

### Additional Talk 2

Childish Jiang: Daddy's even hidden a load of cool stuff here like snacks, wine, and even some Mora! Daddy says I'm not supposed to tell Mommy about that part though.
Childish Jiang: But then this one time just as Daddy was leaving the house, he went and told Mommy about all the places where he was hiding stuff anyway.
Childish Jiang: But whatever, some of the stuff that goes on between mommies and daddies isn't meant for kids to understand. Let's keep playing, shall we?

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: I managed...
Childish Jiang: It's okay, there's no shame in admitting you found this a tough challenge. It is the ultimate hiding place, after all.

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: It was a little tough.
Childish Jiang: Haha, well, this is the ultimate hiding place after all. It's normal that finding it was a challenge.

### Additional Talk 5

Childish Jiang: Even Mommy's never found this place. One day, she suddenly said she wanted to play hide-and-seek with me, with me as the hider and her as the seeker.
Childish Jiang: So I went to a special hiding place that Daddy once told me about, and sure enough she couldn't find me at all. Then, I heard loads up people walking up the mountain...
Childish Jiang: I thought it must've been Mommy getting all her friends to help look for me. So I hid even further inside.
Childish Jiang: After a few days, she still hadn't found me. I thought she might be worried, and I was also a little hungry... so I came out. But she still didn't find me.
Childish Jiang: Maybe Mommy got mad because I was so well hidden that she couldn't find me? Still... I'd have thought that Mommy or Daddy would've found me by now, after such a long time...
Childish Jiang: But anyway, thanks for playing with me for so long. Mommy and Daddy always said I shouldn't take up too much of other people's time, and that when I get somebody to do something for me, I should always repay them.
Childish Jiang: So here you go, take these. They're from the hiding place that Daddy picked out for me.
Childish Jiang: This one time, a guy brought some food for me, and I wanted to repay him too, but he wouldn't take it. I have no idea why...
Childish Jiang: Okay, I'm going home. You can carry on with your other stuff now.

### Additional Talk 6

Childish Jiang: Are you ready to play hide-and-seek with me now?

### Additional Talk 7

Childish Jiang: Let's play.
Childish Jiang: This time, I'm gonna hide in the best hiding place ever. You'll never find me!

### Additional Talk 8

Childish Jiang: Bet you won't find me this time!

### Additional Talk 9

Childish Jiang: Okay, this time I'm gonna go to... my ultimate hiding place! You'll never find me there.

### Additional Talk 10

Childish Jiang: Looks like this was kinda hard work for you.
