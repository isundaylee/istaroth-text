# Fullmoon Egg

One of Liyue's traditional snacks. The egg has been beaten into the flour to form a dough and the shrimp and fish have been diced, minced, and packaged into the shape of a teacup, before being garnished with whole shrimp and steamed in a pot. The resulting design is like that of clouds embracing the moon, hence the name Fullmoon Egg.
