Bennett: #Hehe, hey there, Traveler!
Bennett: Looks like my luck is pretty good today!

## Talk

Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Bennett: It's awesome!
Bennett: It sure beats sleeping out in the open when adventuring. Way better!
Bennett: You don't need to find a hole in a tree to rest in, and you don't have to worry about sneak attacks from monsters.
Bennett: Rocks crashing from the sky... Whopperflowers popping out of nowhere...
Traveler: You can come here and relax after your adventures.
Bennett: R—Really!? Awesome!
Bennett: I'm so lucky to have someone as nice as you as a partner!
Bennett: Hehe, looks like I'll be bothering you a bunch from now on.
Traveler: That's... pretty rough.
Bennett: Nah, not at all... It's an adventure! They're always like this.
Bennett: With your concern, I already feel like my wounds aren't hurting anymore! Really!

## Talk

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Bennett: Sure, lemme tell you all about my adventures!
Bennett: Hmm... A few days ago, I found an oddly colored Berry during an adventure!
Bennett: It was really sweet, but...
Traveler: Did you get the runs?
Bennett: Oh, diarrhea is nothing. I'm used to that.
Bennett: At first, there were a lot of colored lights, but then it felt like a lot of little people were dancing in my head.
Bennett: I recovered quickly enough, but I regret not putting some in my bag...
Bennett: I wanted to warn everyone to avoid eating that type of Berry.
Traveler: You're really considerate towards others, aren't you?
Bennett: Aw... this is how it ought to be.
Bennett: So many people took care of me, so I gotta return the favor!
Bennett: Oh, right! Remember to call me next time you go adventuring! With me around, you won't have to worry about those kinds of dangers at all!
Traveler: You need to be more careful yourself...
Bennett: Thanks, but there are times when it doesn't matter how careful I am. It would be better to warn others instead.

## Talk

Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Bennett: For us adventurers, what we want to do is adventure, naturally!
Bennett: To get the treasure at the end of the journey, or to take the first steps into the unknown...
Bennett: No, wait... What I want to say is that I want to become your helping hand!
Bennett: Look, I might not have any physical talents, but I don't fear pain and can adapt to long battles!
Bennett: I get injured a lot from accidents, so I'm really skilled at bandaging wounds!
Traveler: I'm aware of all this...
Bennett: Right... We've been traveling together for a while, haven't we...
Bennett: ...I've actually thought about this many times.
Bennett: Of course, I'll keep to my mission, but I've got other personal interests outside of that, too.
Bennett: I want to become someone you can trust and depend on.
Bennett: A companion through thick and thin, good times and bad...
Bennett: This time, I want to become your strength!
Traveler: You've always been an important companion of mine.
Bennett: Th—Thank you...
Bennett: Oh... what's wrong with me? This is supposed to be a happy occasion.
Bennett: Thank you...
Traveler: I'll share some of my good luck with you.
Traveler: Why do you want to be my helping hand?
Bennett: Well... that's because you're the adventurer I admire the most!

## Talk

Bennett: You've got a top-notch tent here! And the knapsack on the floor is a limited edition that costs a ton of Mora!
Bennett: ...If Benny's Adventure Team could deck everyone out with gear like this, then I wouldn't have to worry so much about recruiting members...
Bennett: Ahahaha... I don't wanna put you out or anything...

## Talk

Bennett: High-quality ores, a flawless workbench... and an enormous anvil and furnace!
Bennett: Amazing! It's just as good as Mister Wagner's smithy! You could fix anything here!
Bennett: Please, let me rent this place!
