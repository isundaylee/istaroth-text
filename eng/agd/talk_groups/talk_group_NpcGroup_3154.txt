Traveler: Could you tell me a bit about yourself?
Saimon Eri: I've lived my whole life in Konda Village. There are no legends here that I wouldn't know about.
Saimon Eri: Are you asking if I'm doing alright here by myself? Haha, it's very nice of you to ask, but I'm not alone.
Saimon Eri: We haven't received any letters from our son in a long time after he went off to join the army. So my husband decided to leave the village to ask around concerning his well-being...
Saimon Eri: *sigh* I really don't think there's a need to be so worried. Jirou has always had good luck. The archons will watch over and protect him.
Saimon Eri: Besides, he's a clever boy. He knows a million ways to keep himself alive. Everything will be just fine.

Saimon Eri: Now then, which one would you like to listen to?

### Talk 2 related talk 0

Traveler: How about "The Vanishing Fox"?
Saimon Eri: Mm... Legend has it that there was once a white fox who called herself "Saiguu," and who served the Electro Archon. It is said that she would occasionally appear in the form of a human to listen to people's wishes.
Saimon Eri: However, all wishes require some sort of recompense. They say that your wish would be granted if you offered fried tofu to Saiguu.
Saimon Eri: Legend has it that she once tasked the ancestors of Konda Village with a mysterious mission. In return, she would protect and ensure the eternal peace and prosperity of the village.
Saimon Eri: However, for some unknown reason, Saiguu stopped responding to people's wishes. As such, fewer people made offerings to her. Eventually, the mysterious mission was also forgotten.
Saimon Eri: Afterwards, villagers gradually began encountering some kind of "spirit" around the village.
Saimon Eri: People who have seen this "spirit" have described it as something that takes the form of a young woman who appears on thundering, rainy nights. Sometimes, she seems near — and other times, far away...
Saimon Eri: Some say this must be because the offerings have become lacking. Others say that it's because the people of Konda Village have forgotten their mission. Either way, the great fox now manifests angrily in the form of a ghost as a warning.
Saimon Eri: Some even say that she is no longer the white fox who brings prosperity, and that instead, she's become a resentful Tatarigami...
Saimon Eri: Once a Tatarigami sets its eyes on you, it will continue to stalk you in dark corners that you cannot see...

### Talk 2 related talk 1

Traveler: Let's hear it for the "Tanuki of the Chinju Forest."
Saimon Eri: Tanuki are mischievous little fellows.
Saimon Eri: That remains true for the tanuki of the Chinju Forest. They're not evil monsters, but they do enjoy playing tricks on people.
Saimon Eri: Saiguu noticed this and began matching wits with the tanuki. She came out on top, of course, leaving them razzled and dazzled, stumped and stymied on many an occasion.
Saimon Eri: After Saiguu mysteriously disappeared, the tanuki grew bored, having lost their competitor and playmate, and turned to pulling pranks on villagers who pass by.
Saimon Eri: Do be careful if a pretty little house, delicious food, or golden Mora ever suddenly appear before you while you're in the mountain forest.
Saimon Eri: Because before you know it, the treasures would've become dirt, and ah! You'd realize that you've fallen for their tanuki tricks all too late...

### Talk 2 related talk 2

Traveler: Let's hear "The Battle of the Onmyouji."
Saimon Eri: The mischievous tanuki are part of this story as well.
Saimon Eri: The nosy tanuki are always out and about with their pranks. But one day, they finally messed with someone they shouldn't have.
Saimon Eri: The Shogunate began to look into the matter and found that the mischief of a bake-danuki was to blame. They then sent an onmyouji by the name of Kamuna Harunosuke to deal with the problem.
Saimon Eri: The poor little tanuki were no match for the great Onmyouji... In the end, all the tanuki were sealed inside Chinju Forest.
Saimon Eri: So if you ever hear strange voices in the forest, it might be the tanuki saying "Help me~ Heeeelp me~~"...

Saimon Eri: Hello there, how have you been?
Saimon Eri: You seem to have been on the road all this time. Why don't you put your feet up in the village for a while?

### Talk 7 related talk 0

Traveler: About your family...
Saimon Eri: Jirou is safe, all thanks to you, and it seems that he's matured quite a bit, too. I shouldn't have to worry about him hanging around those punks again.
Saimon Eri: The old man doesn't seem any different from before he left. Still always nagging about everything.
Saimon Eri: *sigh* Though the Saimon family no longer has a chance to serve the Almighty Shogun, we do know our place and responsibilities. The most important thing for a family is to be safe and happy. Everything else comes second.
Saimon Eri: So don't push yourself too hard, youngster.

Traveler: There's still something I need to do.
Saimon Eri: There's no need to rush. You're a kind person. The kindness you've shown others will surely be repaid.
Saimon Eri: As for what my husband gave you, it'd be great if it can be of use to you. If not, well, then don't pay it too much mind.
Saimon Eri: Ah, it seems like I've got the same problem as that naggy old man, I hope you don't find me annoying.
Saimon Eri: Anyway, I hope you pace yourself and tread steadily. Slowly but surely, you will ultimately reach your goals.
