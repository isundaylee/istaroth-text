Traveler: About the opera...
Qiu'ge: *cough* Well, although life's not great before you make a name for yourself, and my teacher would hit me often...
Qiu'ge: To me, standing on stage and becoming the center of attention makes it all worth it.
Qiu'ge: Imagine the enraptured audience, beside themselves with grief or clutching their bellies with laughter because of my every action and change of expression...
Qiu'ge: Ah... If you'd ever had that feeling, you would know what I'm talking about.
