Ruins Investigation Log: "It seems that this was originally a castle built during wartime. A stronghold where mortals and adepti fought jointly to defend Liyue together. Also, something about... Rex Lapis' "lingju."

Speaking of monsters, looks like another bunch of hilichurls is headed this way..."
Paimon: ...Yikes. D'you think the guy who wrote this is okay?
