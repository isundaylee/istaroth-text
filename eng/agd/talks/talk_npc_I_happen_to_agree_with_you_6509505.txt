Traveler: I happen to agree with you.
Argalia: I know, right?
Argalia: Back then, Lynette didn't blame us for not taking care of the tableware better. She even apologized, saying that this sort of thing always happens to her...
Argalia: Maybe she only said that so we wouldn't feel too awkward about things. I mean, she seems rather cold, but she's actually super modest and polite!
