Traveler: How are the people at the Jade Chamber doing?
Bu'yun: It's all thanks to the help of the adepti and Lady Ningguang's brilliant planning...
Bu'yun: The secretaries, maids and guards of the Jade Chamber are all safe and sound, and are at present well-settled in Liyue Harbor.
Bu'yun: If you wish to meet Lady Ningguang...
Bu'yun: I'm afraid that she is occupied by administrative tedium, and cannot meet you presently.
