# Missing title (3323976479)


## Talk 1

Paimon: Huh? Is it just Paimon, or are the Statues of The Seven in Natlan a bit weird?
Paimon: Shouldn't it be more... intense the first time you touch it? Like, there's a "schwing"-y sound, that kinda feeling?
Traveler: Eh, seems normal enough to me?
Paimon: But it really is kinda strange...
Paimon: Hmm, how should Paimon put it... Well, she always felt that before, there'd be a stronger connection established when you touched Statues...
Paimon: This time, it feels more like hitting a switch, like all that happened when you touched the Statue was that it lit up.
Paimon: Right, right! Before, when you touched the Statues, you could feel the elemental power. But this time...
Paimon: Does it have that Pyro feel, all lively and intense?
Traveler: (You carefully search within yourself...)
Paimon: Huh... Nothing at all...?
Paimon: That seems kinda weird no matter how you look at it...
Traveler: (There's none of the scorching sensation you expected...)
Traveler: Actually, the "schwing" before was me.
Paimon: Oh! So you just forgot to "schwing" this time, then? Well, next time, try to pay more attention...
Paimon: AS IF! You better add your own sound effects every time you touch a Statue of The Seven!

## Talk 2

Paimon: ...Yeah, it's definitely off. You still can't get elemental power from the Statue of The Seven?
Paimon: Geez! Just what's with the Statues?
Traveler: Maybe it's just old and needs some maintenance.
Paimon: But it totally glowed when you touched it!
Paimon: Hey! C'mon, Statue of The Seven... Are you doing your job properly?
Paimon: Paimon hasn't got a clue...
Traveler: Perhaps Natlan's just special...
Paimon: Now you mention it, it does sound like Natlan's constantly been affected by the influence of the Abyss... Could that be why?
