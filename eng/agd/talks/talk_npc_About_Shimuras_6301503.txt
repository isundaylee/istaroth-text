Traveler: About Shimura's...
Shimura Kanbei: How do you like it? The food's got that authentic flavor, eh?
Shimura Kanbei: Back in the days, I was just a poor samurai without a single dime to my name. I started Shimura's from the ground up. Every plank and every window here, I installed by hand.
Shimura Kanbei: I manage every ingredient, every sauce and every change in cooking temperature. It's guaranteed to be top-notch. Even Uyuu Restaurant can't compete with us!
