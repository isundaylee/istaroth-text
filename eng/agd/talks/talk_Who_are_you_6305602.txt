Traveler: Who are you?
Mikoshi Genjirou: I'm Mikoshi Genjirou, a government official affiliated with the Tenryou Commission.
Mikoshi Genjirou: What... So you are not here to take over my shift? Then please leave me alone.
Mikoshi Genjirou: An elite like me is always either hard at work or honing my skills. This is a world in which only the best survive, after all. Only the most excellent will stick around.
