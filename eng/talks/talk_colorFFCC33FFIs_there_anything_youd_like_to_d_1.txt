Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Is there anything you'd like to do?</color>
Lisa: I'd quite like to invite you to afternoon tea.
Lisa: I can offer you Sunsettia or Rose Bud Tea... And as for snacks, what kind of cake do you like?
Traveler: Are you going to bake it yourself?
Lisa: Haha, you guessed correctly.
Lisa: There is nothing I can't create if I put my mind to it.
Lisa: It's just that...
Lisa: Most of the time, I don't find these sort of things to be worth all the extra effort.
Lisa: But you are special to me. I don't think about energy spent if it's for you.
Lisa: Hmm, perhaps instead of asking for your preferences...
Lisa: ...I should let it be a surprise instead.
Traveler: Your kind offer alone was the most delightful surprise I could hope for.
Lisa: Oh my! Remind me not to add too much sugar, because you, cutie, are sweet enough already.
Lisa: Seriously, though, I need to start getting prepared...
Lisa: We can't have you underestimating me.
Traveler: I'm fine with anything.
Lisa: Ah, you're so easygoing. It's so relaxing spending time with you.
Lisa: But for once, I do want to take the trouble to make something nice.
