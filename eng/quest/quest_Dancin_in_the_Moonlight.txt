# Dancin' in the Moonlight


## Talk 1

Magnifico: Ker-chak! Behold, a miracle of light and shadow — Fontaine's latest industrial achievement!
Paimon: What? That's nothing new to us. Also, you haven't told us what you need help with yet!
Traveler: Yes, just come out with it.
Paimon: From the looks of it, you probably want us to help you take a photo, right?
Magnifico: Oh... Well, sure! Here's your deposit. Please take it.
Paimon: Wait. This is a ton of Mora!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wrraa!
Magnifico: As you have seen, I need to take a few pictures of Saurians, and I'm not talking about one of those three-view drawings you see in animal illustration books either... What I'm going for is something full of vitality!
Paimon: Y—Yeah, okay!
Magnifico: But on the other hand... more vitality means "less likely to listen to me." So, if it's convenient, could you dear adventurers please help me take the ideal pictures I need?
Paimon: Y—Yeah, okay!
Magnifico: Of course, you don't have to force yourself to do things beyond your ability, but I suspect you could at least protect me from hostile life forms.
Magnifico: So please, keep the deposit... and as for whether to help or not, I'll leave that decision to you!
Paimon: Whoa... All this money's making this bag super heavy... You sure it's all ours?
Magnifico: Come on, you think I'd deceive you? Or should I double-check the sum for you?
Paimon: Hehehe... Hahaha! Well, looks like you've come to the right people, because Paimon is a renowned Saurian tamer here in Natlan!
Paimon: #Don'cha worry. So long as Traveler and Paimon are here, any Saurian you wish to tame will be tamed!
Paimon: Tepetlisaurs? Easy-peasy? Qucusaurs? Cheddar-cheesy! Iktomisaurs? Lemon-squeezy... Uh, we also do Koholasaurs, Yumkasaurs, Tachankasaurs...
Traveler: Tachankasaurs?
Paimon: ...Bigheadasaurs, Miniarmasaurs, Gigagogglesaurs, Scarysaurs, Superscarysaurs, Somewhatscarysaurs, Weirdosaurs, Normiesaurs, Skinnysaurs, Hulkasaurs...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Hoohroo!
Traveler: What are you talking about, Paimon?
Paimon: And... the Rawoorasaurs!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawoo, rawoo!
Paimon: And the Wraahrasaurs!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wraah! Rawr!
Paimon: Anyway, you name 'em, we can handle 'em!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Hrrm, Hrmm!
Traveler: *sigh* Alright, we'll help you.
Paimon: #Of course we will. We've already taken a deposit of that size, after all! Right, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}?
Magnifico: Ah, wonderful. Wonderful!
Traveler: Sorry, I've got things to do.
Paimon: But we've already taken the deposit...
Magnifico: Ha, it's fine. Just wait till you have the time! It's not like I'll melt into a helpless puddle without your help, eh?
Traveler: Back it up, Paimon. Listen to yourself!
Traveler: One moment there, Paimon...
Traveler: Pay up and I'll help.
Paimon: We're super cool, so Mora up front.

## Talk 2

Magnifico: Hmm... Next up, an Iktomisaurus under the moonlight! Yes, that sounds good. Getting the ideal lighting is going to take some work, though.
Magnifico: #Hmm... Aha! It's your time to shine, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}, my little friend!
Paimon: Little? Pfft. He's nearly taller than you, Paimon'll have you know!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rrrwar? Roo?
Magnifico: Very good, very good... The timing's perfect... Haha! My masterpiece is almost complete...
Paimon: Then make sure you get a good shot, just like the subject's one of your Fontainian girls! Hehe, that's how the line goes, right?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Hrooo, rroooh!
Magnifico: Haha, just relax!
Magnifico: This angle! This moonlight Ah! Ah! Simply perfecto!
Magnifico: Just a moment, let me see... I'll need two more light sources. One needs to light up the Iktomisaurus's profile, so we get that contrast between warm light and the backdrop of night... That's how we'll create an air of mystery.
Magnifico: And the other light source needs to illuminate the Saurian's silhouette. Not for any complicated reasons, but it is a necessity.
Magnifico: Yes, yes... That's what we're looking for! Just like a dream...
Magnifico: What the... Drat!
Magnifico: I'm sorry, but perhaps the atmospheric elemental concentration here differs from that in Fontaine. Something must've gone wrong with the machine... But no rush, everyone. Let me check.
Magnifico: *humming* Hmm... Not here... Not here either...
Magnifico: Dammit, dammit, damn it all! Gah! You sickened blackguard, you cosseted, coddled nincompoop! Arrrgh!
Magnifico: You... You...!
Paimon: Hey, hey, calm down!
Traveler: It's practically smoking!
Magnifico: Phew... Well... It's a goner now, isn't it?
Paimon: ...
Magnifico: Heh. Don't look at me like that. If nothing else, I feel better now!
Magnifico: *sigh* Well, it's as you see. Our artificial lighting is broken — and after all that Mora I spent on it, too. Disappointing. Just like my ex-wife...
Paimon: Alright, just... stop for now. Chill out, and don't panic. We're here to help!
Magnifico: *sigh* I'm sorry... Phew. Alright. What do I need? Ah, yes. I need to shine one light on the *left side of the Iktomisaurus's face*, and the other on the *contours of its back*.
Paimon: No problem! Let's do this!
Black Screen Text: And so, Magnifico begins tinkering with his Kamera once more, leaving you all to think about how to make a suitable light source...
Traveler: What's going on? You getting a divorce?
Paimon: What!?

## Talk 3

Magnifico: "Louis, Louis!" ...Ah! You scared me half to death there!
Magnifico: So, have you changed your mind, or are you just here to say hello?
Traveler: To say hello, and help while we're at it.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Hoohroo~
Magnifico: Haha. That's wonderful, then. Let us get started!
Traveler: We're just passing through.
Magnifico: Alright then, best of luck!

## Talk 4

Magnifico: Go work on the lighting. I don't require any help over here.
Magnifico: *Light up the left side of its face, as well as the outline of its back!*

## Talk 5

Magnifico: Haha, good, good! Come now, my little model, stay still... Yes, you're so very clever! Three, two, one, say cheese!
Magnifico: Ah, would you look at that? A masterpiece? And whose work is it? Yes, mine — Magnifico de la Magnificans!
Magnifico: Thank you, thank you so much! Haha! Now then, here's the balance I owe you! Ah... and this too. Look.
Paimon: Ooh, a final payment...
Paimon: Wait... Of only one Mora?
Magnifico: Great... And now, our true protagonists are about to make an appearance! Come on in, don't be shy! You're a star, so make that entrance dazzle!
Magnifico: Phew, and that's a wrap! Here, take this copy as a gift... and know that you have obtained this masterpiece before any Fontainian gallery could!
Traveler: Thanks. We'll treasure it.
Paimon: But, the final payment...
Magnifico: I'll be heading to this location next... Here, let me mark it out on your map. Who knows, perhaps our next meeting might be just around the corner!
Magnifico: And when it comes, I might even need your help once more!
Paimon: Ugh, you're practically taking us for granted, aren't you?
Magnifico: Well, our meeting wasn't for me to decide. T'was fate — yes, fate! — that brought us together.
Magnifico: See you, and good luck, my friends!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Raaawr!
Black Screen Text: Magnifico picks up his luggage and leaps into a hot-air balloon.
You watch the balloon first shake violently, causing him to give a hearty laugh. Then it quickly regains stability before floating far away.
Traveler: Doesn't look like it'll be worth much Mora...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wrooh? Wroo...
Paimon: Yeah... Paimon's disappointed too... She thought the final payment would be more substantial than the deposit...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Magnifico: Wait... Why did you disappear when the Iktomisaurus showed up? And why did it disappear once you returned?
Magnifico: Could it be that...
Paimon: #That's right, he went off to the bathroom!
Magnifico: ?
Paimon: Uh, just think about it. We couldn't all go at the same time, could we? That'd be awkward — and embarrassing, too!
Magnifico: #Oh, yeah, right... Haha, of course! Traveler couldn't turn into a Saurian! Surely not! Not that it'd be a bad thing, of course.

### Additional Talk 2

Magnifico: Now I thought I heard people talking about me — but I never expected it to be you! Hah, what a coincidence!
Paimon: Whoa! Guess we forgot you have a hot-air balloon, huh? Not that you've ever brought us along on it, you stingy...!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawoo! Rawoo!
Magnifico: Well, you've never asked, have you?
Paimon: And why would we... Ugh, you never told us, so how would we know that asking was even an option!
Magnifico: #A pleasure to meet you all again, Mr. Traveler, and dear little Paimon!
Magnifico: See, I knew we'd meet again! Just in time, too — there's something I need your help with.
Paimon: Here? Is it something tricky?
Magnifico: Not too much trouble, really. You'll find out in a jiffy!
Black Screen Text: Magnifico leaps nimbly from his hot-air balloon and retrieves his Film Kamera and tripod from his luggage, assembling them in an open space.
He soon finishes his work and stands before you proudly.
Magnifico: Hehe, either way, do make way. I'm about to make landfall!
