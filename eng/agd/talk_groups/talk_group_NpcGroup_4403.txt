Traveler: So, what's up ahead?
Fodil: It depends what you mean by "up ahead."
Fodil: On one side, you have Aaru Village. As you can see, it is a village bordering the desert, and is home to us, the people of the desert.
Fodil: Though we are cut off by the Wall of Samiel, this is still a safe place that welcomes those who wish for rest.
Fodil: Travel can be exhausting, and the desert is perilous. If you wish to stop for rest during your journey, this is the place to be.

Traveler: Could you tell me more about yourself?
Fodil: If you're looking to get some intel on the pretext of small talk, then you've come to the wrong person.
Fodil: In any case, Aaru Village has never been home to any secrets.
Fodil: This is a place of exile for the Akademiya. Most people struggle to even make ends meet — never mind have any manner of strange thoughts.
Fodil: Secondly, we, the desert people, consider this place our final home. We will defend it no matter the cost.
Fodil: So it doesn't matter what your reasons are — if you threaten the stability of the village, we, the Aaru Village guards, will take action against you without a second thought.

Traveler: What about the other side?
Fodil: That place is unfamiliar to me.
Fodil: When I was still working with the Eremites, I did go to Port Ormos several times, but all the work we got usually involved... kicking people while they were down.
Fodil: I decided it wasn't for me, so I left. I've never left the village since then.
Fodil: The only things I learned there that are worth mentioning are things I learned from the school of hard knocks.
Fodil: And well, now I use them to protect the village. That suits me just fine.

## Talk 6

Fodil: It's alright. I play pretty often in my downtime. Losing to me is no big deal.

## Talk 7

Fodil: Not bad! I'd say you're one of the best players out here in the desert!
