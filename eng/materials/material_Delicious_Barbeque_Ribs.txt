# Delicious Barbeque Ribs

A tender meat dish with crispy skin. Even before it has been taken off the grill, the enticing meaty aroma assails your nostrils with promises of heaven. Take a single bite, and the crackling of the skin gives way to the juicy, tender meat within... No wonder this dish steals the show the moment it is placed onto the table!
