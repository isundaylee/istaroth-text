# Calamitous Tread


## Talk 1

Paimon: We're back!
Lynette: Welcome back. Do you want a cup of tea?
Paimon: How can you be so much like Wriothesley, always drinking tea...
Lynette: Huh, actually, now that you mention it, I just remembered something now.
Lynette: While I was sedated, I could still barely hear two people talking next to me. They were discussing everything from the leaves to the water and even the teacups themselves...
Lyney: ...Must have been Wriothesley and Sigewinne.
Lynette: Yeah, I heard one male voice and one female, so it should have been the two of them. They... really were just talking about brewing tea.
Freminet: I really can't make sense of this place...
Lyney: #So, Traveler, Paimon... Were you able to learn anything from Wriothesley?
Paimon: Yeah, he explained everything.
Lyney: Very well... then would you mind checking your answers against my speculations?
Traveler: Lyney sounds a lot more like his old self.
Lyney: Yeah, I took the time to rest, so I'm feeling a lot more relaxed now.
Lynette: ...Nobody else is around, and Miss Sigewinne is also busy with something or other, so let's just talk here.
Lyney: Alright. Then, I'll posit my theories. I asked myself three questions.
Lyney: Firstly, why was Freminet affected by the Primordial Seawater? It was because he dove into the sea. My theory is... the long lost Primordial Sea is probably very close to the Fortress of Meropide.
Paimon: Whoa, he's good! He got that right on the first try!
Freminet: That's our Lyney.
Lyney: Secondly, Wriothesley's attitude changed dramatically during the course of our stay here. He ignored us completely at first, then suddenly roadblocked us. Why?
Lyney: I spent quite a long time thinking about this. If he has been monitoring the Fatui since the very beginning, he probably ignored us at first because he was hoping we could find Master Childe for him.
Lyney: What's more, the Fortress of Meropide is not a part of Fontaine's court system, nor does it report to Iudex Neuvillette. Wriothesley is basically the king of a no man's land.
Lyney: As long as the Fortress doesn't do anything about Master Childe's disappearance, "Father" can use it to pressure the Fontaine authorities. And while the two factions are pitted against each other, Wriothesley will be free to move between the parties of interest.
Lyney: If I had to guess, he probably has something that he's working on himself. It's likely related to the secret of the infirmary, but I just can't think of what it could be...
Traveler: Lyney's grasp of the big picture is amazing.
Paimon: You're super smart!
Lyney: Haha, thanks so much. Then finally, there's the last question.
Lyney: If Wriothesley does have a plan, what could it be? All I know for now is that his plan probably has something to do with the changing nature of the seawater. He's even gotten Clorinde to help him out...
Lyney: ...That can't be the full extent of what he's doing. There's probably a secret passageway behind the block in the infirmary, and there's something big in the Fortress that most people here never get to see. He has a bargaining chip, and it could be important enough for "Father" to deal with him directly.
Lyney: I don't have enough information, so I have no idea what his chip might be. But let me guess... you have the last piece of the puzzle.
Black Screen Text: After some deliberation, you share the information you just learned with Lyney and company.
Black Screen Text: While sharing what you saw, you emphasize that now is not the time for disputes, and it's very important that they take the matter seriously and considerately.
Freminet: I can't believe it...
Lynette: The sea... will engulf everyone. Just like the prophecy said...
Lyney: Could Wriothesley have wanted to meet "Father" to figure out a way to deal with this crisis?
Lyney: If you remember, I once mentioned that "Father" sees the House of the Hearth as her base of operations, and she truly wants to resolve the crisis. But how could Wriothesley have known that?
Lynette: Or perhaps, he didn't know, and just wanted to bring "Father" over to his side? Which could be why he said he just wanted to "negotiate."
Lyney: #...Yeah, that makes sense to me. I understand your concerns as well, Traveler. I'll figure out a way to pass this on to our "Father." No matter what, we're on your side.
Lyney: The two of you have already aided us far too much. We probably would not be standing here right now if not for you.
Lyney: If you ever need anything else going forward, please come to the House of the Hearth at any time.
Lyney: Though you may not share the sentiment, after all that we've gone through together, the three of us basically see you as family now.
Freminet: ...You have my gratitude.
Lynette: Thank you for protecting Lyney when it really mattered, and thank you for sharing the secrets of the Fortress with us. We didn't think you were going to do it.
Paimon: Why are you being so formal all of a sudden?
Traveler: Don't mention it.
Paimon: *growl*...
Traveler: What was that?
Paimon: Ah... Paimon... Paimon's hungry...
Freminet: You've done so much already, go get some food!
Paimon: Alright, then we'll catch you guys another time!
Traveler: We can work together again if necessary.
Lynette: Given your strength, you might not need our help at all. But if you are ever in danger, we will try our best to protect you.
Paimon: Aww! The sound of that makes Paimon feel all warm and safe inside!
Traveler: Feeling better now, Lyney?

## Talk 2

Prison Broadcast: It's time for dinner. Welfare Meals now being served in the Coupon Cafeteria!
Paimon: Come on, let's go pick up ours as well!
Sigewinne: #Ah, Traveler and Paimon! Over here!
Paimon: Are you here for dinner too, Miss Sigewinne?
Sigewinne: Mhm, and I'm taking the opportunity to prepare Miss Clorinde's dinner as well.
Paimon: Huh, you're right... She's actually sitting in the fortress cafeteria...
Sigewinne: What would you like to eat?
Traveler: Huh? We can choose?
Sigewinne: Yep, you can! I've already talked to our chef, Mr. Wolsey. It's all on me today, so you can get whatever you'd like.
Traveler: Then I'll have the tastiest stuff you have to offer!
Paimon: Me too, don't forget Paimon!
Sigewinne: No problem! Just leave it to me.
Black Screen Text: After a while, the meals Sigewinne ordered for you arrive. Unlike days prior when you had to rely solely on luck, the dishes before you today are bursting with flavor.
Black Screen Text: Sigewinne also brings some drinks over to you. They taste a little strange, but she insists that they are very nutritious... She also insists that Wriothesley is also a fan of them, but neither you nor Paimon buy her claims.
Black Screen Text: ...Okay, the shakes genuinely taste pretty terrible. At the very least, however, they help you to calm down and relax.
Paimon: Ahhhh!! Sooo delicious!!
Traveler: Amazing!
Paimon: Paimon's so happy, Paimon wants to feast like this every day, hehe.
Sigewinne: Feeling full yet? How's the food?
Paimon: Delicious!
Traveler: Exquisite, thank you!
Sigewinne: Aw, I'm so glad to see you all so happy! See, the expression on your face just now... The muscle here just moved, which suggests that you're feeling quite relaxed at the moment.
Paimon: Sigewinne, do you do this to help your patients, or to better understand human beings?
Sigewinne: A bit of both, I suppose. I'm a Melusine, which means I'm very different from human beings. I must know what you're thinking if I want to take good care of you.
Paimon: You're really good at taking care of people... Even though you're so short, you still talk and act like an older sister.
Sigewinne: Really? You're reminded of an older sister? Hehe, that's great to hear.
Paimon: Oh, and what did you mean back in Wriothesley's office, when you said that you were protecting Lyney and his siblings as well?
Sigewinne: Oh, that? I just asked His Grace to look out for those children, especially that diver boy. I was getting a bit worried after hearing that something was wrong with the water...
Sigewinne: Thankfully, Clorinde is very strong, and managed to save him in the nick of time. His Grace also sealed the pipes after Clorinde left to make sure that Lyney wouldn't impulsively chase after his brother.
Sigewinne: Although the path was blocked, we still stationed some guards there to stop anyone from approaching. They were instructed to only open the door once Miss Clorinde had returned.
Sigewinne: Oh, and I was keeping an eye on Mr. Lyney as well. We had to press him, but we couldn't allow him to be in any real danger.
Paimon: You are all super considerate and really thought everything through...
Sigewinne: Hehe, it's just what we do down here at the Fortress. At least, this has been His Grace's style for as long as he's been the leader.
Sigewinne: *sigh* I really wish Monsieur Neuvillette would come down here more often too. I feel like he'd like it here... With all the darkness and chaos...
Traveler: (But that doesn't make sense at all... It's hard to imagine Neuvillette outside of his office...)
Sigewinne: Get a good night's rest, you two! You've both worked very hard.
Traveler: Besides the milkâ€” Uh, I mean, everything was super delicious!
Traveler: Free dinners are the absolute best!
Paimon: Is this how it feels to be freeloaders? Wait a second, we did do plenty of work, after all...
Traveler: Then I'll get the biggest portion you have to offer!

## Talk 3

Prison Broadcast: Attention! Please evacuate upwards and outwards, upwards and outwards! If you're already at the topmost layer, then try to move as far outwards as possible!

## Talk 4

Paimon: What happened, why is everyone running around... Hey! What are you doing?
Hurried Prisoner: No time to explain, mate! Goodbye!
Paimon: Eh? Hey, wait!
Paimon: What's wrong with these people!? They won't even talk to us!
Cuistot: They're here! Ah, there you are!
Laverune: Thank goodness.
Paimon: Cuistot and Laverune? Do you know what happened here?
Cuistot: We came here especially to inform you! Something seems to have gone terribly wrong just now, His Grace is telling everyone to evacuate and get out of here.
Cuistot: Laverune was saying, you two are new here, and don't have many friends, so you might slip through the cracks. Haven't you heard of stories like that? An evacuation is successfully completed, yet you only find out once you do a headcount that one or two people are missing...
Laverune: Wait, weren't you the one who brought that up? Why is it suddenly my idea?
Cuistot: Hey, shut up!
Laverune: Okay, whatever. The point is, you should come with us.
Traveler: You said His Grace said to... evacuate "outwards"?
Laverune: Yeah, he said to get as far away as possible, upwards and outwards.
Traveler: (Then that means whatever happened must have happened down below... Oh no, isn't that gate at the very bottom!?)
Paimon: Oh no, it can't be that thing!
Cuistot: What? Hey! Where are you going!?
Paimon: We have to go find the Duke! You two, just go and get out! Go on without us!
Laverune: Hey! Heyyy! ...Be careful!

## Talk 5

Clorinde: Alright. Seems like the problem inside has been suppressed.
Wriothesley: Let me guess, we're safe for now?
Neuvillette: Indeed, but only for now.
Wriothesley: I win this bet. You owe me a present.
Clorinde: Very well, it was indeed just as you said.
Neuvillette: You made a bet?
Wriothesley: We made a bet on the size of your entourage. Clorinde thought you wouldn't come down by yourself.
Clorinde: I figured you would have at least brought a few people along for appearances' sake. It appears I underestimated just how confidential the mission was.
Wriothesley: Shouldn't you have gotten used to confidential missions by now? That's just how the courts operate.
Neuvillette: So... what gift must the loser give? Tea?
Clorinde: He already has tons of tea in his office. I'm thinking about a set of legal codices.
Wriothesley: That wouldn't happen to be a dig at my lack of legal awareness, would it...
Clorinde: Well, I'm sure His Grace doesn't consider the Fortress to be outside the law.
Neuvillette: I was under the impression the residents of a place like this would be uninterested in the legal codices...
Wriothesley: Uh, that was obviously a joke.
Wriothesley: Anyway, you've still got some unfinished business to attend to in the overworld, correct?
Clorinde: No need to stay here if you have a pressing matter. We all know you can't leave Palais Mermonia for long.
Neuvillette: ...Thank you.
Neuvillette: (I hope everything went smoothly with the Fatui Harbinger.)

## Talk 6

Paimon: Neuvillette! Why are you here?
Neuvillette: #Traveler, I need you to head to the opera house immediately.
Neuvillette: Furina will soon be meeting with The Knave there. You must protect Furina and make sure she doesn't spend too much time alone with her.
Traveler: Okay, you can explain everything else to me later!
Neuvillette: Will do. You have my sincerest gratitude.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Look, there are a ton of Fatui and Palais Mermonia people over there! The Knave is probably here already... We need to hurry!
Receptionist: #Are you two Traveler and Paimon? Monsieur Neuvillette has left instructions. Please follow me.
Receptionist: Though I'm sure he's already explained, this should be a mostly cordial conversation unlikely to give rise to violence, but it would be most appreciated if you could protect Lady Furina to the best of your abilities.
Traveler: I will do my best.

## Talk 8

The Knave: Oh, so you two are the honored guests Miss Furina mentioned.
Furina: Of course, of course! How could they not attend a meeting such as this? I must always have two or more guests at my dessert table, otherwise the occasion would be too lonely and unbecoming of my station.
The Knave: #It is my pleasure to make your acquaintance, Traveler, I have heard much of your accomplishments. I am The Knave, one of the eleven Fatui Harbingers.
Traveler: (So this is The Knave... the head of the House of the Hearth, and the Lyney siblings' "Father." She certainly does not seem easy to deal with.)
Traveler: Greetings.
Furina: I've already prepared seats for you. Come, sit beside me.
The Knave: Perhaps you two are unaware of how Miss Furina and I do things. You see, we actually recently agreed to get together for tea when we had the time.
The Knave: See this? This is a limited type of confectionery that Miss Furina simply adores. There are only sixteen slices sold every day. Here, why don't you and Paimon have a taste?
Traveler: (She seems friendly enough, but that can't be all there is to her... The Knave is a force to be reckoned with. I should be very cautious around her.)
Furina: #Traveler, what do you think of this cake?
Traveler: It's pretty good.
The Knave: That's good to hear. So what Childe said was on the mark after all... you do share a taste in desserts with Furina and I.
Traveler: (Wait, Childe should have no reason to have said something like that.)
The Knave: I wonder how he's doing nowadays. You must have heard, right? He's suddenly gone missing. I'm really worried about his safety, you know. Here's to hoping that he's an excellent swimmer.
Traveler: I have faith in his abilities.
Furina: Uh... Since we're talking about him, I feel like I should add something. His martial prowess really looked... certainly pretty impressive, yeah!
Traveler: (Furina looks quite nervous... There must be some kind of bad blood between her and The Knave.)
The Knave: Oh, so you're also familiar with his aptitude for fighting, Miss Furina? Ah, right, I almost forgot. Childe was subdued by Iudex Neuvillette right in front of you.
The Knave: Against ordinary people, my colleague would never be on the back foot, but alas, he just never imagined he'd run into such a person... Hmm... I must express my admiration for Monsieur Neuvillette.
Traveler: I managed to find a few leads on his whereabouts.
The Knave: Hmm. Coming from you, that's not surprising at all.
Furina: Eh? But... I thought you would be happier to hear the news...?
The Knave: Of course, but it's still a bit of a shame. You see, I would have been far happier had I received this news somewhat earlier. As you well know, a long time has passed since Childe disappeared.
Furina: ...
Paimon: Uh... Well, in any case, there's no need to worry! We know for sure that Childe is still alive!
The Knave: Oh? And just how do you know that?
Paimon: Because... Because we found evidence that proved he left the Fortress of Meropide!
The Knave: And where did he go after leaving the Fortress?
Paimon: Well...
Traveler: (Oh no... Paimon's statement just left us wide open...)
The Knave: The Fortress of Meropide lies deep beneath the waves. Unless he pranced right out of the main gate, he must have had to swim for it. Do you have any proof that he surfaced safely?
Traveler: ...We do not.
Traveler: But there was also no evidence that he's been injured or killed.
The Knave: Ah, that is good news at least. His sister Tonia sent a letter to Fontaine not too long ago. Since he was unfortunately unavailable, I picked it up on his behalf.
The Knave: Do you have any idea how he usually writes back to his family? "Dear Tonia, your letter made me feel like we were still enjoying our time in Snezhnaya together. I'm currently admiring the scenery on the streets in front of the opera house..." Is it something like that?
Traveler: (She's turning up the pressure, I'm not sure if I'll be able to convince her... But I can at least try to distract her from Furina.)
Traveler: That sounds good to me, yes.
Furina: All letters tend to follow the same few formats anyway, right? As long as the contents are accurate, it doesn't matter so much how it's written, or how it's worded...
Furina: ...
Paimon: Hold on! The water in the teacup is shaking...?
The Knave: ...
The Knave: I suppose this is also a sign of things to come, Miss Furina.
Furina: Huh? Ah, I don't quite understand what you're trying to say...
The Knave: â€”Have we entered into the next stage of the prophecy?
Furina: ...
Traveler: It's quite tasty, and I think Paimon agrees too.
Traveler: Pleasure to meet you, too.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Clorinde!
Clorinde: Ah, it's you two.
Paimon: How's dinner?
Clorinde: It's alright. Miss Sigewinne really put in a lot of effort.
Paimon: So we heard that Wriothesley invited you to come down to help and you saved Freminet, too. You sure work super fast.
Clorinde: It was child's play.
Paimon: Still, Paimon didn't know even Champion Duelists could take on side jobs...
Paimon: Oh and, why aren't you eating with Sigewinne and the Duke? Won't you get bored eating by yourself?
Clorinde: Miss Sigewinne was with you, and the Duke has business of his own.
Paimon: Hm... Actually, didn't Navia say that you went out for dinner with her as well?
Clorinde: Yeah. First time in a long time.
Paimon: "First time in a long time"? So you mean, you've gone out to dinner with her in the past?
Clorinde: In the past, yes.
Clorinde: You seem to be enjoying yourselves here.
Traveler: It's all thanks to Neuvillette...
Clorinde: Things will be getting messy at the Fortress soon. Don't run around unnecessarily.
Traveler: This is technically a work trip for us too...

## Talk 10

The Knave: *sigh* I must say, we've spent long enough playing house.
The Knave: Miss Furina. As the Hydro Archon, I am sure you understand the exact meaning of the phenomenon we just witnessed. Or should I say, that's what I originally thought, but looking at your expression... was I wrong, and you haven't a clue?
Furina: ...What are you trying to say?
The Knave: At this point, I don't think there's any more need to speak as diplomatic representatives. Allow me to speak to you now as just a Fontainian: You know the prophecy by heart, and also that every part of it is being proven true.
The Knave: Yet here you are relaxing, drinking tea and eating desserts as if it's all nothing more than a few stray bugs in your garden. Do you really think that's acceptable?
The Knave: The prophecy's hanging above our necks like a guillotine. Every faction is looking for a way to either avert the disaster or save their own. Even the orphans of the House of the Hearth have devoted everything to saving their homeland.
The Knave: But you? It beggars belief just how nonchalant and carefree you have been. From the very beginning, you, the god Focalors... You have utterly failed to take action.
Furina: You're wrong... I've never ignored the prophecy, nor have I just been passing the time in self-indulgence. Retract your accusation, and stop doubting the wisdom of the gods with such absurd conjectures!
The Knave: I am not alone in my doubts, you know. All the children of Fontaine may be harboring the exact same thoughts right now.
The Knave: O great Hydro Archon, how are you going to save them? Save us? How are the people you've sworn to protect supposed to survive in a land that will soon disappear beneath the waves?
Furina: I have my ways, and I've been working on them for all this time... Even if you look down upon me, you have no right to judge me!
Furina: Fontaine will be saved. Even... Even if I still cannot see the true future right now, as long as I continue on as I am, I will be able to hold my head up high!
Traveler: (Furina's not acting like her usual self. She's actually seriously refuting The Knave's accusations... She means what she says. She's not putting on a front.)
The Knave: Then I ask you, Miss Furina, just what have you been working on? Where can we see it, and what is it doing to help?
Furina: ...I...
Traveler: (...So was that all a lie? Or can she really not tell us? She was so full of conviction and confidence just now, but now she's deflated like a popped balloon.)
Furina: ...My machinations are just like the prophecy itself â€” they will only reveal themselves at the fated time. It is just that beings like yourselves are unable to perceive them as of yet.
The Knave: I see. As a god, the proof of your labor always lies beyond prying mortal eyes.
The Knave: Allow me to be so bold as to ask another way. Would it be possible for you to tell us the parts of your plan that are not confidential? Such as... your emergency response plan for the impending disaster.
Furina: Uh... An emergency response plan...?
The Knave: Ah, that look in your eyes... Have you not even prepared one of those?
Furina: The... The emergency response plan is also strictly confidential.
The Knave: Then allow me to jog your memory. Miss Furina, what is the purpose of your Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale?
The Knave: And what do you plan to do with the massive amounts of Indemnitium that it has accumulated over the years?
Furina: Thâ€”The Oratrice? It... It's just like it appears to be...
The Knave: Hmph, so you also have no idea? If I'm not mistaken, someone's using it to prepare for something. But unfortunately, it would seem that someone is not you, Miss Furina.
The Knave: I first caught wind of this when Lyney tried to investigate the Oratrice in the opera house. You see, even just getting close to the core contaminated him with an extremely large amount of Indemnitium.
The Knave: But if even that had nothing to do with you... Then what could you possibly be working on, O great Hydro Archon?
The Knave: Oh, right, I almost forgot. Iudex Neuvillette is not at the tea party with us today. Miss Furina, I suppose you must have ordered him away to take care of some troublesome business.
Furina: Ah, yeah, yes, that's exactly right! Please keep it a secret for me.
The Knave: Of course I will. Although I must say, Miss Furina, you seem quite insecure without the Iudex by your side.
The Knave: Very well, let's stop that conversation here. There are still a few slices of cake left, so please help yourselves, everyone.
Traveler: (These aren't topics I can speak about... I don't even know what Neuvillette's task was.)
Traveler: (If I had to guess, he probably went down to deal with the surging Primordial Sea... But can he really deal with it all by himself?)
Traveler: (And is Furina being truthful or not?)
The Knave: #Traveler, I heard that you were recently commissioned to handle a few matters on behalf of the Iudex. Why don't you take an extra slice of cake? Those who work hard deserve gratitude and praise.
The Knave: You too, Paimon.
Paimon: Er... Thank you, Paimon will take you up on that offer...
Black Screen Text: The Knave proceeds to change the topic and brings up a number of less significant matters. While the atmosphere gradually becomes more relaxed, the somber feeling from the prior conversation remains in everyone's hearts.
Paimon: Ah! Paimon's super full. That cake was great!
Furina: Mhm-mmm, if it's on my tea table, it must be of the highest quality. Ah, yes, and we must thank The Knave for bringing these over as well.
The Knave: You're welcome. I'm sure the cake also felt greatly honored to be featured at Miss Furina's table. And I was merely catering to Miss Furina's tastes, seeking a chance to chat over tea.
The Knave: It is getting late. Why don't we call it a day? There are still a few matters that I need to take care of, so I must take my leave now.
Furina: Very well, we'll end it here.
The Knave: #Mind seeing me off, Traveler? We could use the opportunity to discuss Childe before I must be on my way.
Traveler: ...Of course.
Paimon: Paimon's coming, too!

## Talk 11

The Knave: I'm glad that you were willing to come with me. Of course, Childe was just an excuse. I have no interest in your dealings with him.
Paimon: That's what Paimon thought!
Traveler: What do you want to say?
The Knave: You lent your aid to the children of the House of the Hearth. As their "Father," I would like to express my gratitude.
Traveler: ...There's no need.
Traveler: Was there nothing else you wanted to say?
The Knave: That was all. Formal topics should be discussed in formal settings, and informal topics in informal settings.
The Knave: I know you just returned from the Fortress of Meropide. Relax, I have no intention of trying to get anything out of you. Lyney, Lynette and Freminet are still there, and I trust their judgment and abilities.
Paimon: They've all been working very hard, and have always done all they can to fight back against anyone who tried to stop them! Especially Lyney...
The Knave: You mean Wriothesley. He's a tricky one to deal with. It's unfortunate that Lyney's so eager to prove himself that he can't learn to rely on others... including me.
The Knave: By the way, and you can just consider this a bit of idle gossip, but what's your impression of Furina?
Traveler: ...
The Knave: You are outside of our disputes, and the freest person in all of Fontaine, able to move around most easily. Allow me to share my perspective with you.
Fatui Sergeant: ...And that's everything that happened during the trial. Master Childe was declared guilty, and immediately transported to the Fortress of Meropide.
The Knave: Didn't he say he was coming here on vacation? Does he not feel an ounce of shame for all the trouble he has caused?
Fatui Sergeant: I... I...
The Knave: Forget it. He did give us an opportunity.
The Knave: I will be meeting someone shortly.
Fatui Sergeant: Do you require help with any preparations?
The Knave: No need. I will take care of it myself.
The Knave: (I need to meet with Furina, the Hydro Archon. She is at the heart of Fontaine, but what's fascinating about her is that, she often seems more like a celebrity than a working Archon.)
Furina: Oh? Come over here, you little critter you!
Stray Cat: Mrrow!
Furina: You dare to run from me? Stop right this instant!
The Knave: (My goal is just to discover the location of the Gnosis, but I didn't expect the chance to approach Furina to be handed to me on a silver platter. This is so easy, it's actually making me a bit suspicious...)
The Knave: (Anything left unguarded is usually just bait. But no one will blame someone for taking the bait. After all, from the moment it was attached to the hook, the bait is meant to be sacrificed.)
Furina: Waaaaaah!
The Knave: (It's just as I guessed in the second before I struck. The Hydro Gnosis is not currently held by the Archon...)
The Knave: (In fact, this "archon" doesn't seem like a god at all... And I sense that she's under some kind of curse...)
Furina: Who are you? Aâ€”And whâ€”what are you trying to do? Please don't kill me, I'm begging you, please...
The Knave: (The fear in her pupils is genuine, so perhaps she is not bait after all. Either way, targeting her has lost all meaning.)
The Knave: ...
The Knave: (I left the scene with ease. Nobody came looking for me, and nobody could serve as a witness to my near-assassination of Focalors. I suspect even Furina dares not mention this incident to anyone.)
The Knave: (Not long after, my informants confirmed what I had guessed: After returning to her quarters, Furina quietly cried alone. She was so scared that she could not sleep that night, nor could she even bring herself to eat her cake.)
The Knave: (There's no doubt that there's something wrong with her. I began to entertain the possibility that she is not the true Hydro Archon â€” perhaps Iudex Neuvillette is actually the genuine article.)
The Knave: (I have to find the Gnosis. If the Neuvillette hypothesis is correct, he is probably in possession of it. Alternatively, it might have been hidden in a place that's hard for ordinary people to access.)
Lyney: Yes, "Father"!
The Knave: My dear children. Please speak.
Lyney: News from the Fortress of Meropide. Master... Master Childe has gone missing. On top of that, the contacts and guards we bribed at the Fortress have all gone quiet as well...
The Knave: ...Probably the handiwork of that Wriothesley.
Lynette: I'm afraid so.
The Knave: This is a good opportunity. The value of a Harbinger is much higher than most would imagine. We now have an excuse to exert diplomatic pressure on the Fontaine authorities.
The Knave: Set up a meeting for me. I would like to meet the Hydro Archon and Iudex Neuvillette.
The Knave: Oh, and I have an additional mission for you three.
Lyney: Yes, "Father"!
The Knave: (Tartaglia's disappearance was not a part of my plan, but I can use it to make a breakthrough. With this as my excuse, I can ask for an official audience, and continue my investigation of Furina and Iudex Neuvillette.)
The Knave: (The initiative belongs to the House of the Hearth. My wish to investigate the Fortress of Meropide will be a front. Lyney and his group will be responsible for the actual intelligence-gathering.)
Traveler: ...I didn't think that's what you wanted to talk about.
The Knave: Do I look like an irresponsible "Father" to you? Hehe, the House of the Hearth is very important to me. You should know that I care deeply about my children.

## Talk 12

The Knave: You should know the rest. Lyney's group is quite close to you, so they wouldn't have hidden anything from you.
Paimon: Yâ€”You attacked the Hydro Archon?
The Knave: It wouldn't mean anything even if you shouted it from the rooftops. After all, even Furina herself is still pretending that nothing of that sort ever happened.
Paimon: Uh, alright then...
The Knave: I've now had two chances to enjoy tea with Furina. I have to say, the leadership of Fontaine is even more inscrutable than I had imagined. I once surmised that Iudex Neuvillette must be the Hydro Archon, but now, that doesn't seem right to me either.
Traveler: How did you come to that conclusion?
The Knave: I am a servant of Her Majesty the Tsaritsa. Over my years of service, I've learned how a real Archon conducts and carries themselves. Whether Iudex Neuvillette or Furina, neither fits the bill. It's hard to imagine either of them as the Archon.
The Knave: Of course, that is all just how I feel. Gut feelings often do not require justification.
The Knave: It is, however, quite amusing to me that after all my years working in intelligence gathering, I've come to realize I am at a complete loss regarding the identity of the god of the land of my birth.
The Knave: Don't you think Fontaine is quite intriguing? A catastrophe looms, yet many secrets have yet to rise to the surface. It looks like Fontainians will have no choice but to save themselves.
The Knave: Ultimately, though, one must survive in order to do anything else. Should the need arise, I would be happy to cooperate with you.
The Knave: You don't need to commit to anything right now, of course. I have a feeling that the situation will continue to evolve. And as your name is often connected with noble deeds, I'm sure we will work together someday.
Traveler: ...Neuvillette?
The Knave: He certainly returned quickly. You must want to catch up with each other, so I'll leave you to him.
Neuvillette: ...
Paimon: Neuvillette, is it over?
Neuvillette: For now, yes, but this issue will prove quite thorny in the long term. I am concerned that sooner or later, the prophesized events will occur...
Neuvillette: Thank you for protecting Furina.
Traveler: May we ask what happened down there?
Neuvillette: Mmm... To put it simply, I used my power to force back the Primordial Sea and re-seal the sluice gate.
Traveler: As for what happened on our side...
Black Screen Text: You recount the happenings of the tea party to Neuvillette...
Neuvillette: ...So, as expected, The Knave has turned up the pressure on Furina. She's trying to feel her out, though I'm still unsure as to her motives.
Traveler: Can I ask you some questions?
Neuvillette: Permission granted.
Traveler: You have enough power to force back the Primordial Sea...
Paimon: Whoa, it can't be that you're the real Hydro Archon, right? But that's just a speculation on our part, though...
Neuvillette: ...
Paimon: You can't tell us? Then... Then that's okay, we can talk about something else, we won't try to force you... Hahaha, you guys in Fontaine are super strange...
Neuvillette: If by the phrase "you guys" you are referring to Furina and I, then although I'm not sure just what you are trying to imply, I must clarify that I do not share her positions on a multitude of topics.
Traveler: What did you sense in the Fortress of Meropide?
Neuvillette: I believe so. The Fortress has a long and complex history. It has seen much grief and suffering.
Neuvillette: ...And now, another catastrophe will soon be upon us. I mourn this turn of events.
Paimon: Huh? Why is it raining all of a sudden?
Traveler: (The clear skies suddenly filled with dark clouds. The rain became heavier, light rain soon growing to a downpour.)
Traveler: (And just moments before, Neuvillette has just mentioned his sense of grief.)
Traveler: (Thinking back to that legend, and what Freminet said... "It's said that a Dragon of Water once resided in Fontaine. Every time it weeps, the skies will cloud up and pour out rain.")
Traveler: Wait, Neuvillette, you can't be...
Neuvillette: ...You may be closer to the truth than you think.
Paimon: Oh, and what are you thinking?
Traveler: ...He's the Dragon Sovereign of Water.
Paimon: The Dragon of... Huh wha!?
Paimon: ...HUUUUUUUUUHHHH???
Neuvillette: Please do not be so surprised...
Furina: ...
Neuvillette: ...Furina?
Furina: ...
Paimon: ...villette! Neuvillette! Are you listening?
Neuvillette: Ah, my apologies.
Paimon: We were just guessing randomly... We didn't guess right, did we? You're not actually the Dragon Sovereign of Water, right? Well, if you don't want to confirm or deny...
Neuvillette: You guessed correctly. I sincerely hope you'll be able to keep this a secret for me.
Paimon: Ah... right! Of course! We'll definitely help you keep it a secret!
Paimon: There's still something Paimon wants to ask you, though...
Neuvillette: Please go ahead.
Paimon: Well, if you are the Dragon Sovereign of Water, and you were able to force back the Primordial Sea from the Fortress...
Paimon: Then since Fontaine's prophecy is all about seawater, couldn't you just use your power to solve the crisis?
Neuvillette: None of the currently living dragon sovereigns in the world, myself included, possess our full dragonhood.
Neuvillette: They say that when the First Usurper arrived on Teyvat, they seized a part of the dragons' power. Today, that stolen power is the basis of the Archons' Authorities.
Paimon: There are seven elemental Archons, and seven matching Dragon Sovereigns...
Neuvillette: The Dragon Sovereign of Water who lived through that era perished a long time ago. As their successor, I know far less of that part of our ancient history.
Neuvillette: In any case, I believe I will not be able to do much unless the Archon disappears and returns their elemental Authority to me.
Neuvillette: Given the status quo, however, I would recommend finding another way to deal with the prophecy.
Paimon: Oh... So even you can't solve it...
Neuvillette: I still have some urgent matters to attend to at my office. If you have any more questions regarding ancient history, you are welcome to discuss them with me at a later time.
Paimon: Ah, please go right ahead! There's a place that Paimon wants to go, too. Traveler, why don't we pay another visit to the Fortress of Meropide? Paimon is a little worried...
Traveler: Sure.
Paimon: We'll see you another time!
Neuvillette: Take care.
Traveler: See you later, Neuvillette.
Traveler: Did you manage to protect those that needed to be defended?
Traveler: Does this mean you have some deeper connection with the Hydro Archon?
