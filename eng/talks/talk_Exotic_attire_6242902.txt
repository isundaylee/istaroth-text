Traveler: Exotic attire?
Qiaoxi: Yes. You're dressed very ostentatiously indeed... So you're definitely not someone to worry about.
Qiaoxi: Think about it. Criminals would want to dress as discreetly as possible, no?
Qiaoxi: That's based on my experience guarding this bridge, in any case.
Traveler: Tell me about your work.
Qiaoxi: As long as this bridge is here, someone needs to guard it! We can't afford to let our guard down, not for one second.
Qiaoxi: The bridge is a major thoroughfare. So to be handed the job of guarding it is the highest recognition I could ask for.
Qiaoxi: I will never let our enemies have their way, even if it costs me my life!
