Ulman: So, how has the treasure-hunting been going?
Traveler: I have some Iron Coins...
Ulman: Oh, do you? Wonderful! Now, I've got some pretty trinkets on me that I'll trade for them. What would you like?
Traveler: I'd like to view those treasure clues...
Traveler: Goodbye.
Ulman: Happy hunting, Traveler! See you!
