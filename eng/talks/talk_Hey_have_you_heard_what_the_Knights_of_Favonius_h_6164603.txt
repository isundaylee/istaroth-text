Mikhail: Hey, have you heard what the Knights of Favonius have been saying? They're claiming they've defeated Stormterror!
Lyudmila: You know, I have been thinking — the Knights of Favonius can't be as impotent as they look. I'll bet they've been keeping their true power hidden until now...
Mikhail: Hmph. Well, whatever secret weapons they might have stashed away, there's still no way they can compete with the might of the Fatui!
Lyudmila: It's a pity our previous attempts to coerce the Acting Grand Master were unsuccessful...
Mikhail: Ah, it's not a big problem. Didn't you notice about Signora? She didn't seem concerned about this minor quibble in the slightest. In fact, she seemed quite pleased with herself about something.
Mikhail: About something she's done... Or maybe something she intends to do...
Mikhail: Either way — we've got Signora at the helm, and even Barbatos himself would be no match for her!
Lyudmila: Well let's just hope Signora never meets her match in battle...
Mikhail: Relax! This is Signora we're talking about. As long as she's around, everything will be fine.
