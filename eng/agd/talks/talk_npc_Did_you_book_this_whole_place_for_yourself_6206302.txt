Francis: Did you book this whole place for yourself?
Francis: That's right. Yours truly trekked a long and arduous journey from Fontaine just to do business here in Liyue Harbor.
Francis: I've only just arrived in Liyue, so seeing as I've still no friends or companions, I can only book the place for myself, haha.
Francis: Although my original intention was to do business here, I've already decided otherwise...
Francis: Now I only wish but to devote each day to eating Liyue delicacies, I no longer aspire to earning any money...
Francis: Albeit I may only be able to afford eating like this for a few more days...
