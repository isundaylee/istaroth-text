# Good Hunter Express


## Talk 1

Traveler: Hmm, I've got other things to do right now.
Sara: Really? Okay then. I'll find someone else to make that delivery...

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'll deliver it right now.
Sara: Thanks so much!
Sara: Oh, yes, this Mondstadt Hash Brown is just out of the oven, so do handle it with care.
Sara: Don't <color=#00E1FFFF>run too fast, don't use your wind glider, and don't get into a fight</color>, or that hash brown may just come apart.
Sara: You do have to be quick, though. This dish won't taste good if it gets cold.

## Talk 3

Hardworking Silio: Ugh, I'm starving... Why hasn't my order arrived yet?

## Talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Sara: That's correct. You're here to help, right? Then you're right on time â€” I'd just finished making this Mondstadt Hash Brown.
Sara: It's supposed to go to Silio. He paid us earlier, and said that he'd be waiting for his delivery near Stormbearer Point.
