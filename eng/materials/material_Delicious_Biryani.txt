# Delicious Biryani

An aromatic rice dish. The golden crown made of long-grain rice and meat is adorned with Padisarah petals, a picture that reminds you of a desert dotted with oases. The enticing scent of spices dances across each grain of rice. Every mouthful soothes your whole body. It won't take long for a customer to empty the plate. They can't help but lick their mouth, savoring the lingering scent.
