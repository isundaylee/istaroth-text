# The First Experiment: Elements


## Talk 1

Paimon: Paimon has a question. After the seed sprouts, will it grow into anything?
Albedo: I don't know, but I feel the importance will lie in the method, not the end point.
Albedo: Using alchemy to awaken otherworldy life in Teyvat would constitute a big leap in my understanding of the essence of life.
Albedo: After awakening, even creation may be possible.
Paimon: Uhh...
Albedo: Aha... Still a little difficult to understand?
Paimon: N—No! Paimon's got a brain! But what's the seed gonna become? Isn't that more interesting than whatever it was you were saying?
Traveler: Doesn't seem like you understood.
Albedo: Well, if it turns out to be a delicious fruit, dinner's on me.
Paimon: Yay! Paimon's holding you to it!
Traveler: You sure know how to keep Paimon on board.
Albedo: Well, let's just say I... occasionally have to look after a child. Another lengthy explanation I'm afraid. I suppose it's one of the few non-alchemy-related disciplines I'm any good at.
Albedo: The subject of my first research was the elements. In this world, manipulating the elements requires a Vision, though I can't see anything resembling one on your person.
Albedo: How you're able to freely manipulate elemental power is something I'd like to ascertain. I've got a few questions in that regard.
Albedo: Firstly, do you have any extra organs? A second heart, a fourth stomach... things of that nature.
Traveler: No.
Albedo: Fascinating. And this floating child is... connected to your body in some way?
Paimon: What a stupid question! Can't you see the gap between us?
Paimon: And another thing, it's PAIMON! Not "floating child"!
Albedo: I was merely considering the possibility that you were an external organ. Perhaps there is some invisible force connecting you.
Traveler: I met Paimon on my travels.
Albedo: Oh, that rules out that possibility. I wonder, did Paimon guide the elemental power to you?
Albedo: But that would mean that Paimon's elemental power would be enough to break through mountain rock at least ten meters thick. Or cause the waterfall south of Springvale to flow backwards.
Albedo: Hmm. No, that definitely can't be it...
Paimon: Hey! How would you know anyway!?
Albedo: In that case, it would appear that there's no obvious difference between the composition of your body, and that of the humans in this world.
Albedo: Given that there's clearly a discrepancy in the research, it seems that only experimentation will yield the answers.
Albedo: Firstly, this mysterious elemental power. I'd like to examine exactly how it manifests externally.
Albedo: Let me lure a few slimes to the area. Perhaps you'd be able to defeat them, using whatever method comes most naturally to you.
Paimon: Huh? Doesn't seem very sciencey...
Albedo: Direct and clear observation are imperative to a good experiment. This is just a simple exercise.
Albedo: Naturally, if you require a greater challenge, we could bring in six oceanids.
Paimon: Slimes! Slimes are fine!
Traveler: I don't follow. This seems like a hassle.
Albedo: Well, prepare yourself. The slimes will be here any moment.
Traveler: As long as I'm not being batted around by Hydro mimics.
Traveler: I caught Paimon with a fishing rod.
Traveler: Not that I'm aware of.
Traveler: You've seen through Paimon's ulterior motives.
Traveler: That's what I want to know.

## Talk 2

Albedo: Great work. Did you feel anything out of the ordinary?
Albedo: If you're injured, I have a few emergency potions ready.
Traveler: Not a scratch.
Albedo: Excellent. According to my observations, the manifestation of the external elemental flow is as expected, elemental reactions are normal. There's nothing out of the ordinary.
Albedo: Now that we know that the external flow is manifesting normally, let's test the internal flow.
Paimon: Internal flow... How do you test that?
Albedo: It's very simple. I can use alchemy to create a potion that will extract elemental power.
Albedo: If the elemental power is stored or accumulated physically within your body, this potion may elicit an elemental reaction.
Traveler: Will it make my stomach Swirl?
Paimon: Sounds kinda terrifying!
Albedo: Don't worry, in the normal course of events you'd feel some temporary queasiness, no bodily injury.
Paimon: And in the abnormal course of events?
Albedo: If anything unexpected occurs, I've made the necessary preparations. Try not to worry.
Traveler: That's not hugely reassuring...
Albedo: Well, it's not that there aren't any risks involved. But if there is anything blocking your elemental flow, we'll be able to locate it with this test.
Albedo: Just a warning: if an internal elemental reaction occurs for any other reason, that's a bad sign.
Traveler: This is like a health checkup.
Albedo: Yes! That's an excellent way to think about it. Before we get started, the potion we'll use for the test is missing a catalyst. We'll need to find it.
Albedo: It's a type of ore known as Starsilver, but unfortunately not all of it is suitable.
Albedo: I'll take you to my campsite. We can gather some Starsilver Ore on the way. I'll point out any likely contenders.
Albedo: All going to plan, we should be able to begin concocting the potion when we get to the campsite.
Paimon: Paimon's still got a few safety concerns, but seems like there's a silver lining.
Paimon: Let's keep our eyes open!
Traveler: Will it Crystallize in my stomach?
Traveler: Just a bit cold.

## Talk 3

Timaeus: An elemental life form from another world! As soon as we have strong evidence, this may end up subverting a lot of alchemical theories.
Timaeus: Albedo's research will see huge progress!

## Talk 4

Timaeus: Doesn't sound very rigorous, surely there's another approach...

## Talk 5

Timaeus: An elemental life form from another world! As soon as we have strong evidence, this may end up subverting a lot of alchemical theories.
Timaeus: Albedo's research will see huge progress!

## Talk 6

Timaeus: An elemental life form from another world! As soon as we have strong evidence, this may end up subverting a lot of alchemical theories.
Timaeus: Albedo's research will see huge progress!

## Talk 7

Albedo: This is my campsite. I've added the materials we collected to the concoction.
Albedo: While we are waiting, have a look over here.
Albedo: My assistant Timaeus here is helping me with my research. I'm guessing you may have met in Mondstadt already?
Timaeus: Hello, I've just gotten hold of the data from your experiment. The report is already up on the board there.
Paimon: Whoa! Look at all the data! You got all these results from one slime battle?
Timaeus: Haha, I wouldn't call them results. Inferences, and a few daring guesses perhaps.
Timaeus: I think the most rational direction would be to expound on the phylogenetic relationship between this Traveler and the slimes.
Traveler: Rational?
Timaeus: Hmm, consider: You don't have a Vision, but you can manipulate elemental energy. The slimes don't have Visions either, yet they, too, are able to manipulate the elements.
Timaeus: Following this line of thought, I'm sure we'll be able to establish a basis in fact.
Albedo: Not bad for a point of entry, but strictly speaking, slimes are elemental life forms. In other words, beings consisting entirely of the elements.
Albedo: A Cryo Regisvine, or even a Whopperflower might be a better analogy. But tracing back the phylogenetic relationships between plants and animals... You might have to trace back to the world's origins.
Albedo: In that sense, things might get difficult, don't you think?
Timaeus: Uh! Yes sir. That sounds correct.
Albedo: After all, we've got our primary data already. This Traveler is a visitor from another world.
Albedo: #If it turned out that {M#he}{F#she} did have a phylogenetic relationship with this world... Now that really would be something, wouldn't it?
Timaeus: Ahhhh, it would! Apologies, I was so excited to get the data. I'll slow down a bit next time.
Timaeus: Speaking of data — to complete our research, we'll need some more. I'll be conducting analysis here for the time being. If you're keen for an update, just come and find me!
Albedo: Great, I'll leave you to it.
Albedo: Hmm, looks like the potion's ready. I'll try a little first. If all goes well, I'll hand it over to you.
Traveler: I would've thought even Paimon and I were more closely related.

## Talk 8

Albedo: I've just tried some, it's in line with my expectations.
Albedo: Remember to keep calm at all times, and breathe deeply if you feel unwell.
Albedo: I'll be noting down all observable results and data points.

## Talk 9

Paimon: #Tasty? You've got a funny look on your face, {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: It's... burning a bit.
Paimon: #You said you tried some already! You sure it was ready? What happened to {M#him}{F#her}?
Albedo: Hmm? Oh, this was the result I was expecting, and a very positive one at that.
Albedo: This potion channels elemental power into the body. Under normal circumstances, a repelling reaction is to be expected.
Albedo: But if the internal elemental flow is unimpeded, you'll only experience momentary discomfort. Once the flow is complete, there won't be any other effects.
Paimon: So you knew you'd be sick and still drank some?
Albedo: Eh-he, it was my own concoction of course, only natural for me to be the guinea pig.
Traveler: Out of... consideration for the test subject?
Albedo: But of course! You're my assistant, by all sense and reason it would be wrong of me to place that risk onto you.
Albedo: In conclusion, I'd say we have our conclusion! As far as elemental energy is concerned, you're no different from anyone else in this world, nothing peculiar.
Paimon: Aw, Paimon wanted something cooler to happen...
Albedo: Then again, better an ordinary result than a peculiar result. Peculiar results have a tendency to be of the... undesirable variety.
Traveler: I feel like you're referring to something in particular...
Albedo: The good thing about "ordinary" is that everything is an object of reference, and everyone understands you.
Albedo: People are the same, they can understand, empathize, encourage, and support one another.
Albedo: When you're sick, a doctor can diagnose you because they are you. When something goes wrong, you can ask people who've made the same mistake for their experience, because you are them.
Albedo: But a peculiar person... They don't have much recourse for the things we take for granted. The essence of their life is fundamentally different.
Albedo: For example... A human can't understand the life of a Pyro Regisvine, or an Eye of the Storm. Have I explained it clearly enough?
Traveler: I think I'm getting it.
Albedo: To sum up, this has been a positive outcome. Going forward, you can use your elemental power without fear.
Albedo: Timaeus, the results of the new experiment are out. If you could see to collating them...
Timaeus: Just a moment, Sir! I'll handle it!
Timaeus: You gave me a lot to consider, really stretched my limits. I'm thinking a lot clearer now.
Timaeus: Having you down as an animal wasn't very precise of me, but starting with the premise of an elemental life form!? Now that was—
Albedo: Not bad, I think it's an interesting line of inquiry. Whatever the truth of the matter, I'd like your research at the fore as opposed to my judgment.
Timaeus: You can count on me, Sir! I'll extract a result satisfactory to all!
Paimon: Is he trying to join the Knights? He's starting to sound like a suck-up...
Paimon: Uh... What Paimon meant to say was... That's the spirit! Mr. Albedo, say something...
Albedo: Hmm... Before we can proceed with our research, I need to... prepare something. Wait one moment.
Albedo: If you're interested, why not have a look around? It may help to pass the time.
Traveler: Still seems... like there's another layer of meaning to your words.
Traveler: What about the risk to you!
Albedo: Perhaps it's just scholarly self-assurance, and it certainly speeds things up.
Traveler: You drank this!?
