Traveler: What kind of creative cuisine is that?
Tomoki: Dango Milk that's been marinated in rock, and macerated in roll â€” Rock 'n' Roll Dango Milk! Here, have one on me.
Traveler: It's just regular Dango Milk, right?
Tomoki: I wouldn't go that far! At least, it might have been to begin with, but not after hearing all that rock 'n' roll that I made it listen to.
Tomoki: That's also why it now tastes like regular Dango Milk that's been lying around for a while.
Tomoki: But this way, some customers are even willing to pay double the price of regular Dango Milk just to get their hands on this stuff.
Tomoki: Must be the power of rock 'n' roll, eh? It's so mind-blowing that I can't even put it into words.
