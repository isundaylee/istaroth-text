Traveler: You can cook?
Ashpazi: Ahem, what kind of question is that?
Ashpazi: Don't look down on my culinary expertise just because I'm wearing a Forest Watcher's uniform! I'm the renowned "Master Chef" of the Forest Rangers!
Ashpazi: ...Haha, alright, alright, that's enough jokes for now.
Ashpazi: Still, even if I'm not truly "renowned," my culinary skill is pretty extraordinary. Everyone praises it once they try it.
