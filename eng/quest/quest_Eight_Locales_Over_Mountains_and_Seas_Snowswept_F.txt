# Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas: Snowswept Fairytale


## Talk 1

Ioroi: I leave Kichiboushi in your trusty hands. He is quite wise. Once he grows older, I plan to pass my titles of "Bake-Danuki King" and "Protector of the Grove" unto him.
Ioroi: So, please take good care of him. Make sure he doesn't catch a cold!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hmm, even though we managed to raise that huge pillar on the mountaintop...
Paimon: D—Dragonspine is just... super c—cold no matter how many times we come here... Ugh...
"Kichiboushi": Mmhaha! White Fur weak.
Paimon: What!?
Traveler: Not afraid of the cold, Kichiboushi?
"Kichiboushi": It's v—very cold. Very very cold.
Paimon: Come on! Why'd you call Paimon weak, then?
"Kichiboushi": B—But very fun. White everywhere.
Paimon: White... Oh, you mean the snow!
"Kichiboushi": "Snow"? Things fall from Sacred Sakura... "Sakurafubuki"... Snow?
Paimon: No, no. Snow is the super cold stuff around Dragonspine.
Paimon: Huh, but Paimon didn't expect that you knew of sakurafubuki, Kichiboushi. Guess that's the bake-danuki of Inazuma for you, huh.
"Kichiboushi": Mm! Snow! Cold! So cold!
Traveler: Kichiboushi seems pretty happy.
"Kichiboushi": Mountain with snow to be cold? Or the cold mountain has snow?
Paimon: ...
Paimon: #Um, that's a good question, actually. What do you think snow's actually made of, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: Hydro, I think.
Paimon: Hmm. If that's the case, the Hydro elements must've frozen and become snow because the place is too cold.
"Kichiboushi": C—Cold. So much snow.
Paimon: We should probably ask someone knowledgeable like Lisa about this stuff in the future.
Paimon: Dragonspine really is cold, though. When we were last trying to reach the summit, Paimon was so cold that her brain almost stopped working...
Paimon: But the view's great, though! Since we can see this place from Mt. Yougou, we could probably see Mt. Yougou from Dragonspine's summit, too!
Paimon: And Starglow Cavern's really deep, too. Maybe we might find some never-before-seen treasure in there...
"Kichiboushi": Treasure! Treasure, good thing!
Traveler: Looks like the two of you will get along well, Paimon.
Paimon: Hehe, well, there's no good life or food without treasure! Kichiboushi's pretty smart, huh?
"Kichiboushi": Kichiboushi, want play in snow!
Paimon: Hey, don't catch a cold now!
Traveler: If you run into any danger...
Traveler: Just holler "there's treasure"!
Paimon: What!?
Traveler: Cryo, most likely.
Paimon: Eh? If that's the case, the Cryo elements within the snow must be making this place colder...
"Kichiboushi": C—Cold. So much snow.
Traveler: It's probably Kaeya's fault.
Paimon: "Don't get frostbite."
Paimon: Still, Paimon doubts that Kaeya's that strong.
"Kichiboushi": Mm?

## Talk 3

Paimon: Ugh...
Paimon: D—Dragonspine is super c—cold no matter how many times we come here... Ugh...
"Kichiboushi": Mmhaha! White Fur weak.
Paimon: Eh!?
Traveler: Not afraid of the cold, Kichiboushi?
"Kichiboushi": It's v—very cold. Very very cold.
Paimon: Come on! Why'd you call Paimon weak, then?
"Kichiboushi": B—But very fun. White everywhere.
Paimon: White... Oh, you mean the snow!
"Kichiboushi": "Snow"? Things fall from Sacred Sakura... "Sakurafubuki"... Snow?
Paimon: No, no. Snow is the super cold stuff around Dragonspine.
Paimon: Huh, but Paimon didn't expect that you knew of sakurafubuki, Kichiboushi. Guess that's the bake-danuki of Inazuma for you, huh.
"Kichiboushi": Mm! Snow! Cold! So cold!
Traveler: Kichiboushi seems pretty happy.
"Kichiboushi": Mountain with snow to be cold? Or the cold mountain has snow?
Paimon: ...
Paimon: #Um, that's a good question, actually. What do you think snow's actually made of, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: Hydro, I think.
Paimon: Hmm. If that's the case, the Hydro elements must've frozen and become snow because the place is too cold.
"Kichiboushi": C—Cold. So much snow.
Paimon: We should probably ask someone knowledgeable like Lisa about this stuff in the future.
Paimon: Dragonspine's freezing, but unlike other places in Mondstadt, the air here is very refreshing. Really good for clearing our heads!
Paimon: There's a lot of places here that we haven't been to, too.
Paimon: #If we've got a chance in the future, {NICKNAME}, we should go further into Dragonspine — we might find some treasure long-buried beneath the ice!
"Kichiboushi": Treasure! Treasure, good thing!
Traveler: Looks like the two of you will get along well, Paimon.
Paimon: Hehe, well, there's no good life or food without treasure! Kichiboushi's pretty smart, huh?
"Kichiboushi": Kichiboushi, want play in snow!
Paimon: Hey, don't catch a cold now!
Traveler: If you run into any danger...
Traveler: Just holler "there's treasure"!
Paimon: Aw, come on!
Traveler: Cryo, most likely.
Paimon: Eh? If that's the case, the Cryo elements within the snow must be making this place colder...
"Kichiboushi": C—Cold. So much snow.
Traveler: It's probably Kaeya's fault.
Paimon: "Don't get frostbite."
Paimon: Still, Paimon doubts that Kaeya's that strong.
"Kichiboushi": Mm?

## Talk 4

"Kichiboushi": Mmhahaha! Slow, slow, weak!
Paimon: Argh, this guy isn't cute at all!
Traveler: Don't laugh at people, Kichiboushi.
"Kichiboushi": Laughing, not good?
Paimon: Hmm, how should we put it? Laughing's good, yeah, but laughing at other people isn't.
Traveler: It's only good if everyone can laugh together.
"Kichiboushi": #Understand. Sorry, {F#Aunt}{M#Uncle} Yellow Fur.
Traveler: #Also, it's not {F#Aunt}{M#Uncle}. It's {F#Big Sis}{M#Big Bro}.
Paimon: #Paimon's name is Paimon, and {F#Big Sis}{M#Big Bro} Yellow Fur is {NICKNAME}. You've got to remember that, Kichiboushi!
"Kichiboushi": Difficult to remember. Bothersome, White Fur and Yellow Fur.
Paimon: ...
Traveler: Well, no need to force yourself either.
Paimon: Still, what was that trick Kichiboushi used? One moment he created that balloon with a "swoosh," and then "swish," he went floating right over. It looked pretty cool!
"Kichiboushi": Eight tatami Kapow.
Paimon: What in the world is that? Ugh, Paimon's not really getting Kichiboushi again.
Traveler: That was a bit more comprehensible than "Squelch squelch Lavender Melon"...
"Kichiboushi": White Fur and Yellow Fur, not have?
"Kichiboushi": White Fur flip-flap, Yellow Fur flip-flap. So White Fur and Yellow Fur, having.
Paimon: W—Well, you're not wrong...
Traveler: It might be a bake-danuki ability of some sort.
"Kichiboushi": Mm. Snow mountain fun! Go, go!
Traveler: That was even harder than "Lavender Melon Kapow"...
"Kichiboushi": Hehe, Lavender Melon Kapow.
Paimon: What is that even supposed to mean!?

## Talk 5

Ioroi: I leave Kichiboushi in your trusty hands. He is quite wise. Once he grows older, I plan to pass my titles of "Bake-Danuki King" and "Protector of the Grove" unto him.
Ioroi: So, please take good care of him. Make sure he doesn't catch a cold!

## Talk 6

"Kichiboushi": Creatures...
Paimon: Creatures... You mean these Snowboars?
"Kichiboushi": Sealed?
Paimon: Well, no. Just trapped in ice, y'know? Dragonspine is a super cold place, after all.
"Kichiboushi": Oh. Strange.
Paimon: #Hmm, speaking of which, do you wanna take a picture of Kichiboushi here, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: Good idea.
"Kichiboushi": Mm?
Paimon: Hehe, well, we never know when you'll come around here again, so it would be nice to leave a memory of your trip! It'll also help us prove to Ioroi that we did take you traveling!
Paimon: Alrighty then! Stay right there, Kichiboushi!
"Kichiboushi": White Fur, strange. Okay.

## Talk 7

"Kichiboushi": Yellow Fur, powerful. Very, very strong!
Traveler: I've beaten one even larger than this.
Paimon: Oh, right! Did the picture come out okay?
Black Screen Text: You show Kichiboushi and Paimon the picture you just took.
"Kichiboushi": This, just like Kichiboushi. Hehe.
Paimon: This is you, Kichiboushi.
"Kichiboushi": Mm? Kichiboushi, me. Only one.
Paimon: Well, this isn't you, Kichiboushi.
"Kichiboushi": Snow mountain has bake-danuki? But no smell.
Paimon: Um, that's not quite it. Dragonspine doesn't have any bake-danuki. This is just you, Kichiboushi?
"Kichiboushi": ?
Paimon: Eh?
Traveler: (You explain the concept of a photo to Kichiboushi!)
"Kichiboushi": So it's artwork! White Fur silly. Mmhaha!
Paimon: Ugh. This is kinda annoying, but Paimon doesn't know how to refute him either...
"Kichiboushi": Kichiboushi stop laughing. Only laugh together good.
Paimon: Grr...
Traveler: Good Kichiboushi! You get a gold star!
"Kichiboushi": Gold star! Yey!
Paimon: Mm... Then let's stop here for now. You're tired too, aren't you, Kichiboushi?
"Kichiboushi": Mm.
Paimon: That let's go back and report to Ioroi, shall we? He did seem pretty worried about this whole thing.
Traveler: Paimon's gotta eat, so I've gotta hunt.
Paimon: Now that's just rude!

## Talk 8

Ioroi: Ooh, you've returned! Nothing hurt withall? No colds caught? Not hungry, I hope?
Paimon: Well, Paimon wouldn't say no to some food...
Traveler: It went quite smoothly, not to worry.
"Kichiboushi": Mm! Snow cold, but very fun.
Paimon: Ah yes, we've brought a souvenir with us, too!
Black Screen Text: You show Ioroi the picture of Kichiboushi on Dragonspine.
Ioroi: Ahhh! Kichiboushi! Why is Kichiboushi sealed upon this vellum?
Ioroi: Is... Is this a Hell Painting? How comes it into your hands? How?
Traveler: Human magic's pretty impressive, eh?
Ioroi: Oohhh... How could this be...
Paimon: Oh, come on, stop picking on Ioroi already. That's a "photo," and it's a kind of drawing. Look over there. Kichiboushi's fine, isn't he?
"Kichiboushi": Yey!
Ioroi: Eh? Two Kichiboushis... But how? What magic is this?
Ioroi: ...Ooh! I understand! It's magic, isn't it? Hahaha, much progress have you made in so short a time, Kichiboushi!
"Kichiboushi": Mmhaha. Stupid.
Paimon: Ugh... Let us explain, would you?
Black Screen Text: You spend a bit more time explaining how photos work to Ioroi.
Ioroi: Ah, but am I not the world-renowned king of bake-danuki? Of course I knew what this "Kimera" was! I was merely testing Kichiboushi!
Paimon: Don't be ridiculous!
"Kichiboushi": Stubborn. Mm!
Ioroi: Ahem. Well, whatever the case, it appears that Kichiboushi's training proceeds most well indeed.
Traveler: Traveling with Kichiboushi's been pretty fun.
Ioroi: Mm, good, good. Then I leave the rest to you.
Ioroi: When I was yet a young tanuki, I once traveled to 18 sacred sites, treading the tanuki paths as I went — that was how I became the mighty lord of bake-danuki.
Ioroi: Kichiboushi presently only has about half of mine stature in those days. So, perhaps eight places shall do for his training regimen.
Paimon: Feels like it should be nine places, but whatever... Where should we bring Kichiboushi next?
Ioroi: You are unlike other humans. You treat us tanuki well, as good people should. And you are quite sturdy for humans, too. Kichiboushi will learn much by traveling with you.
Ioroi: Thus, I shall let you decide where he shall go.
Paimon: Ooh, sounds good! Don't worry, leave this to us! Let Paimon think...
"Kichiboushi": Go! Go!
Paimon: Hmm... What places should we visit...
Traveler: Take your time, Paimon.
Paimon: Mm, we'll talk again once Paimon's figured this all out! For now, Paimon's kinda hungry.
Paimon: Don't you worry, Ioroi. Leave Kichiboushi to us!
Ioroi: That I shall.
Traveler: Don't hurt your head, now.
Traveler: It's been tiring business.
Paimon: But it's also really fun. And we got to revisit places we went to before, too.
Traveler: This is a photo, and it's a kind of drawing.
Paimon: Exactly. Look, Kichiboushi's just fine.

## Talk 9

"Kichiboushi": Hot, hot! But fun!
Paimon: Huh, but it was either Gyoubu Koban or Shousei who turned into a torch the previous time. Do you tanuki enjoy turning into torches?
"Kichiboushi": Become human things, can play with humans.
"Kichiboushi": Or else, humans not play with Kichiboushi.
Paimon: #Don't you worry, Kichiboushi! {NICKNAME} and Paimon will play with you!
"Kichiboushi": Yey! Play!
Paimon: But there's a cliff ahead of us right now. Would you like us to carry you over?
"Kichiboushi": Kichiboushi, flip-flap, kapow!
Paimon: Eh?
Black Screen Text: Kichiboushi creates what seems to be an airbag.\nUsing its powers of flotation and the chilling winds of Dragonspine, he floats to the other side of the cliff.
Paimon: ...Whoa, what in the world was that?
