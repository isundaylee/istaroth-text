# Amidst Stormy Judgment


## Talk 1

Taroumaru: Woof, woof... woof!
Paimon: Thoma's playing his ventriloquist game again, huh?
Paimon: Thoma... Thoma...
Taroumaru: Woof! Woof! ...Woof!
Paimon: Hey, you can come out now... Paimon's seen you already...
Paimon: Huh, not a peep... Ugh, so where the heck is he, then?
Taroumaru: Woof, woof, woof! Woof!
Paimon: Huh? What's got Taroumaru so worked up today? He's always such a good boy...
Kamisato Ayaka: Hello, have either of you seen Thoma?
Paimon: No, we thought he'd be with you! Why, has something happened?
Kamisato Ayaka: Then it's as I feared... On the way here, I heard that Thoma had been taken away by the Tenryou Commission.
Kamisato Ayaka: I wasn't certain whether it was true, so I came right here. The fact that he hasn't arrived here as we arranged suggests that it is true.
Kamisato Ayaka: The Raiden Shogun is holding a Vision Hunt Ceremony at the Statue of the Omnipresent God today, to mark the 100th Vision seized under the decree.
Kamisato Ayaka: And the 100th Vision bearer in question... the one who will have their Vision seized, I fear... is Thoma.
Paimon: Hold up a second... So the ceremony that Thoma said the Tenryou Commission were busy preparing for... that was this Vision Hunt Ceremony? And he was the target all along?
Kamisato Ayaka: ...I believe so. The shogun and the Tenryou Commission see the ceremony as a milestone. With the 100th Vision, they wish to mark the success of the Vision Hunt Decree to date.
Kamisato Ayaka: ...This cannot happen. I must go and rescue him!
Taroumaru: Woof, woof! Woof!
Traveler: Stay calm.
Traveler: But you are the Shirasagi Himegimi.
Paimon: Yeah! Like it or not, you represent the whole Yashiro Commission. So if you go and pull a stunt like that, you're basically declaring you and the Raiden Shogun are enemies now, right?
Paimon: And by doing it so publicly, you might be implicating a lot of other people from the Yashiro Commission, too...
Kamisato Ayaka: There is no other option... I must act with haste — the ceremony is about to begin. I will not abandon Thoma like this.
Kamisato Ayaka: He is my friend! To think that not long ago, we were... all eating hotpot together...
Traveler: He is my friend, too. I will save him.
Kamisato Ayaka: But...
Traveler: You said it yourself. No time to delay.
Kamisato Ayaka: ...
Kamisato Ayaka: ...Okay, I'll... wait here for your return. Get back safely.
Paimon: Don't worry, Ayaka. A friend's life is on the line — we ain't about to mess this up!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Inazuma's not such a bad place, Paimon's having a pretty good time! But... we should probably go and see about the "next operation" that Thoma and Ayaka were talking about, right?
Paimon: As usual, it's the first stop, Komore Teahouse. Are you ready to head over?

## Talk 3

Paimon: How strange... It's never this quiet here.
Taroumaru: Woof, woof... woof!
