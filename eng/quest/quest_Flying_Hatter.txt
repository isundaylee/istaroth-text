# "Flying Hatter"

Devitt: #Oh my, what an honor. You must be {NICKNAME}, in which case, the one by your side must be your companion, Ms. Paimon.
Paimon: Hehe, right in one! That's us!
Traveler: We're that famous, are we?
Devitt: News travels quickly to, from, and through Constellation Metropole.
Devitt: I must say that you're right on time â€” I was just putting the finishing touches on this game of mine, named "Flying Hats."
Devitt: I can't be like the eponymous hatter in the "Flying Hatter," who gave everyone a lovely hat, I fear...
Devitt: But I believe that "Flying Hats" will bring joy to those who play it.
Devitt: I've also designed three completely different gameplay modes for it... Don't worry, don't worry, the rules aren't too complicated!
Devitt: You'll figure it out after just one game, I guarantee it.
Traveler: I'll give it a try!
Devitt: Alrighty-righty then. This way, please.
Traveler: I'm busy right now...
Devitt: Oh, it's quite alright. Just come find me whenever you've got the time. I'll be staying here for time being.
