Alfred: ♪ The sun is setting in his sky, time for him to say goodbye: Goodbye warm and goodbye light, hello wind and cold of night ♪ ...
Alfred: ♪ Time to rest now, sleepy-head, do not fear the night ahead. I will stay here by your side, stay until the dawn arrives ♪ ...

Traveler: What are you doing?
Alfred: Heh. Just singing my daughter's favorite nursery rhymes.
Alfred: She used to beg me to sing them to her each day the moment I got home... But I was so focused on my work, I—I just ignored her...
Alfred: And then, I went to Liyue to give a performance... she suddenly fell ill and... she didn't make it. I didn't even get to see her before she died.
Alfred: All she wanted was for her daddy to sing to her... Such a simple thing. Such a small thing. And I failed to give her even that...
Alfred: Oh my darling, don't worry, Daddy's here for you... Daddy will always be here for you...

Traveler: (Quietly leave...)
Alfred: Sleep well, my child... Rest your weary head...
Alfred: Daddy will tell the wind to blow away the clouds, so the moon can see your lovely smile...

Traveler: So! Seen anyone who looks a lot like me?
Alfred: Hmm? A relative of yours, you mean?
Alfred: I'm sorry, nothing comes to mind. But I will keep my eyes out.
Alfred: If anyone understands the pain of being separated from family, it's me...
Alfred: I wish you the best of luck, my friend.
