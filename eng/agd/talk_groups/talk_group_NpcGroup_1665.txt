Traveler: Adventure Challenge

## Talk 1

Iris: You're good, but I'm still a little better.

## Talk 2

Iris: You're quite vigilant, and your tactics are impeccable.

## Talk 3

Iris: Excuse me? Did you want something?
Iris: It's so cold here...
Iris: Cold is the norm when you're up a mountain like this one.
Iris: You look like a Traveler. So, are you planning on scaling the mountain?
Traveler: Just to have a look.
Iris: Fair enough. I'm not going to try and stop you... I've met my fair share of travelers and whatever you say, there's no dissuading them.
Iris: All I will say, if you're serious about this, is to keep an eye on your *body temperature* at all times.
Iris: If your temperature drops too low, not only will it slow you down, but you can also injure yourself. And if you're unlucky enough to get attacked by a monster in that state... Well, that's the last situation you'd want to find yourself in.
Iris: So, if your temperature drops dangerously low, get yourself to a *source of heat* and warm back up while you plan your next move.
Iris: In short, and I know you've probably heard this plenty of times, but it's true: This is, by far, the most dangerous place in all of Mondstadt. When you're climbing a mountain, you must always plan your movements carefully.
Iris: I've seen more than a few adventurers lose their lives because they didn't think before they acted...
Iris: Alright, I won't lecture you any longer. Just be sure to prepare before you set out.

Traveler: How are things here on Dragonspine?
Iris: On this mountain? Well, I can only say that it's more dangerous than any other place in Mondstadt.
Iris: Apart from the harsh conditions, this mountain is also home to some strange... ice.
Iris: It is incredibly hard to break, and will not melt when exposed to fire.
Iris: Worst of all, a few roads have been blocked by this ice.
Iris: Quite a few of our expedition teams have been forced to turn back after being blocked by ice barricades that they could not get around.
Iris: *sigh* I wonder when we're going to find a way to get rid of that ice...
Traveler: I'll have a look at it.
Iris: You're just going to have a look, right? If so, I remember that there was a large slab of ice of that kind on the mountain's outer boundaries. Who knows what's frozen inside it...
Iris: You could have a look around there, but remember, it's best not to come this way again.

### Talk 3 related talk 1

Traveler: Tell me about those blue plants...
Iris: If you've a mind to, you can head to the area around the *Snow-Covered Path*, the *Entombed City Outskirts* and the *Starglow Cavern* to have a look. I remember seeing many of those blue plants there.

### Talk 3 related talk 2

Iris: Since we've got a way to melt that ice now, that means I can continue organizing expedition parties to explore the mountain...

### Talk 3 related talk 3

Traveler: Do you know anything about the air current in the cavern?
Iris: You've already been that high up? That's very impressive. Still... a cavern blocked by a strange air current, you say? Let me think...
Iris: We did have an adventure team that also got lucky enough to reach a point very high up the mountain.
Iris: They couldn't get close enough, but they did report that a cavern nearby had a strange and powerful air current flowing out from it.
Iris: But logically speaking, no air current in such a place should be that strong. No one knows the reason why, either...
Iris: Apart from that strange air current, this mountain is also home to some very strange ice.
Iris: This ice is incredibly hard to break, and will not melt when exposed to fire. It has proved a major obstacle to our exploration as a result.
Iris: We have been unable to find a way to deal with that ice, so we've had to go around it...
Iris: What's more, blue plants are often found growing near this ice.
Iris: I could vaguely see that there was something encased within the ice. But since I was unable to melt it, catching a glimpse of it was as far as I got...
Iris: If you're interested, you can follow the trail of blue plants to have a look at that ice.
Iris: Let me think... I believe that the *Snow-Covered Path*, the *Entombed City Outskirts* and the *Starglow Cavern* are home to many of those blue plants. You can go and check them out.
Iris: A strange, powerful air current, bizarre ice, and odd plants...
Iris: Hahaha, if this was your standard tale of adventure, there would be some link between these three.
Iris: But in real life, it's best to be practical when adventuring... Make sure you prepare yourself sufficiently before heading up Dragonspine, you hear?

### Talk 3 related talk 4

Traveler: About the summit...
Iris: There's a strange, huge pillar floating in mid-air at the summit? To think that there would be such a thing atop Dragonspine...
Iris: And there's a huge space below the ice under the pillar? That's... even weirder.
Iris: This is... inconceivable. Thank you. I will send explorers up there as quickly as we can to see what's happening there.
Iris: Ah, yes, I should thank you for helping us open the way to the summit. Please take these as thanks.
Iris: It seems Dragonspine really does have its secrets after all.
Iris: I do hope our next expedition will yield some new discoveries.

### Talk 3 related talk 5

Traveler: So, tell me about the ice.
Iris: Perhaps you've already noticed, but that slab of ice is surrounded by a great many blue plants.
Iris: I believe that those plants may be related in some way to the shard frozen in the ice.
Iris: If you wish to continue looking for those shards on Dragonspine, I'd say that you might have some luck following the trail of those blue plants.
Iris: I believe that the *Entombed City Outskirts* and *Starglow Cavern* are home to many of those blue plants. You can go and check them out. Perhaps you might discover something.

### Talk 3 related talk 7

Traveler: So, tell me about the ice.
Iris: If you'd just like to have a look at the ice, you can just go to the place that I mentioned. For you own safety, don't go any further into the mountain.

### Talk 3 related talk 8

Traveler: This mountain really is a dangerous place...
Iris: Oh? You're back. How did it go? Did you see the ice— Huh. You're in... quite a state, aren't you?
Traveler: Do you know anything about the air current in the cavern?
Iris: You've already been that high up? That's very impressive. Still... a cavern blocked by a strange air current, you say? Let me think...
Iris: Ah, that reminds me. We did have an adventure team that also got lucky enough to reach a point very high up the mountain.
Iris: They couldn't get close enough, but they did report that a cavern near the summit had a strange and powerful air current flowing out from it.
Iris: But logically speaking, no air current in such a place should be that strong. No one knows the reason why, either...

Traveler: So, about the strange ice...
Iris: What? You encountered the strange ice... and you were able to melt it?
Iris: H—How can this be? How did you do it? Huh... There were strange crystals nearby?
Iris: You can use those to melt through the ice? I see, I see... Looks like I'll have to investigate this thoroughly...
Iris: Well, let's put that aside first. Looking at you, I suppose you want to continue going deeper into the mountain, yes?
Traveler: Do you know anything about the air current in the cavern?

Iris: Hmm... Yes, it is a little unusual, both in shape and in size.
Iris: I'm no expert on obscure materials... Orban may know something though, he comes across all sorts of materials in the process of forging weaponry.
Iris: Why not go and ask him? He's right over there, you can't miss him.

### Talk 3 related talk 11

Traveler: That... boy, Cyrus?
Iris: Yes, Cyrus is my younger brother.
Iris: We used to go on adventures together — you could say that we were quite the famous duo, too.
Iris: But he's been tied down by all sorts of trivial matters ever since taking up the role of branch master of the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild. We haven't traveled together in quite some time.
Iris: I did receive an offer to become a Guild branch master myself, but I refused. As far as I'm concerned, it's much easier to be a regular adventurer.

Iris: Low temperatures, monsters, rugged terrain... Everything here is far more dangerous than one would imagine.
Iris: ...Here are some of my notes from adventuring in Dragonspine. Take them with you — I trust that they'll be of some use.

## Talk 6

Iris: Hmm? Is something the matter? Did you come here to see the sights, or did that boy Cyrus send you here on some commission?
Iris: ...Well, whatever your reasons for being here may be, stay on your guard at all times.

### Talk 6 related talk 0

Traveler: So, about your commission...
Iris: Saw my commission and came running, did you? Well, I do have something that I need your help with.
Iris: Specifically, I'd like you to take pictures of two places on Dragonspine. I'll mark the exact locations for you on your map.
Iris: As for compensation, I'll make sure you're paid as per the Adventurers' Guild's rules.
Iris: How about it? Will you take the commission?
Traveler: Why do you need to take pictures in these two spots?
Iris: Well... this has to do with Cyrus, ultimately.
Iris: He asked me previously to get him some of Dragonspine's specialties. Said he wanted to use them as part of a recruitment drive during the Windblume Festival.
Iris: Well, now's the festival period, but he hasn't contacted me at all. Must be busy, I suppose...
Iris: Now that I mention it, he is at that age, isn't he? He should be busy with the festival.
Traveler: I think he might be way too old for that by now...
Iris: Really? I don't really get that feeling. In fact... Hmm, never mind. Let's not get into that right now.
Iris: So far, I've collected some ores and put together some topographical charts and monster reports. I'd like some photos of scenic spots in Dragonspine to go with them.
Iris: So, Traveler, would you mind helping me go up Dragonspine to take pictures of those two spots?
Traveler: You can count on me.
Iris: Great, I'll leave it in your hands, then. I've marked the two places out on your map. Just head there and come back once you're done.
Traveler: Not going to the city to see how things are going?
Iris: It's all a little too much for me. I personally prefer how things are here.
Iris: I've got quite a lot on my plate to boot, so I doubt I can go at the moment.
Iris: I've marked the most scenic spots on your map. Just head there and come back once you're done.

### Talk 6 related talk 1

Traveler: So, about your commission...
Iris: Oh, you're done already?
Traveler: Sure am.
Iris: Thanks for your hard work. I've got the package I intended to send to that boy ready as well. Would you mind delivering it to him? I'll have your payment ready once you're done, so do remember to come back here.
Iris: I'm not sure if this will be enough for him to use, but if he's recruiting, monster records and ores should pack the biggest punch...

### Talk 6 related talk 2

Traveler: About the commission...
Iris: You're back! What took you so long? I bet Cyrus got you to run some extra errands...
Traveler: I helped him make a few inquiries...
Iris: Just what is that boy up to now... Oh? A letter?
Traveler: This letter talks about the recent state of the Guild.
Iris: Huh, doesn't feel like a short read. Seems like he has been busy after all, even during the Windblume Festival...
Iris: Still, if he is working so hard, it's about time the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild recruited some new members.
Iris: Once we have enough recruits, he should be able to delegate the smaller matters to others and come adventuring with me again... *sigh* That would be nice.
Iris: I'll give this a good read. But seeing as Cyrus added to your workload, it's only fair that I factor in some extra payment.
Iris: Here you go. Thanks for your hard work!

Iris: It is incredibly hard to break, and will not melt when exposed to fire.
Iris: Worst of all, a few roads have been blocked by this ice.
Iris: Quite a few of our expedition teams have been forced to turn back after being blocked by ice barricades that they could not get around.

Iris: They couldn't get close enough, but they did report that a cavern nearby had a strange and powerful air current flowing out from it.
Iris: But logically speaking, no air current in such a place should be that strong. No one knows the reason why, either...
Iris: Apart from that strange air current, this mountain is also home to some very strange ice.
Iris: This ice is incredibly hard to break, and will not melt when exposed to fire. It has proved a major obstacle to our exploration as a result.
Iris: We have been unable to find a way to deal with that ice, so we've had to go around it...
Iris: What's more, blue plants are often found growing near this ice.
Iris: I could vaguely see that there was something encased within the ice. But since I was unable to melt it, catching a glimpse of it was as far as I got...
Iris: If you're interested, you can follow the trail of blue plants to have a look at that ice.
Iris: Let me think... I believe that the *Snow-Covered Path*, the *Entombed City Outskirts* and the *Starglow Cavern* are home to many of those blue plants. You can go and check them out.
Iris: A strange, powerful air current, bizarre ice, and odd plants...
Iris: Hahaha, if this was your standard tale of adventure, there would be some link between these three.
Iris: But in real life, it's best to be practical when adventuring... Make sure you prepare yourself sufficiently before heading up Dragonspine, you hear?

Traveler: About the summit...
Iris: There's a strange, huge pillar floating in mid-air at the summit? To think that there would be such a thing atop Dragonspine...
Iris: And there's a huge space below the ice under the pillar? That's... even weirder.
Iris: This is... inconceivable. Thank you. I will send explorers up there as quickly as we can to see what's happening there.
Iris: Ah, yes, I should thank you for helping us open the way to the summit. Please take these as thanks.
Iris: It seems Dragonspine really does have its secrets after all.
Iris: I do hope our next expedition will yield some new discoveries.

Traveler: So, tell me about the ice.
Iris: Perhaps you've already noticed, but that slab of ice is surrounded by a great many blue plants.
Iris: I believe that those plants may be related in some way to the shard frozen in the ice.
Iris: If you wish to continue looking for those shards on Dragonspine, I'd say that you might have some luck following the trail of those blue plants.
Iris: I believe that the *Entombed City Outskirts* and *Starglow Cavern* are home to many of those blue plants. You can go and check them out. Perhaps you might discover something.

Iris: You've already been that high up? That's very impressive. Still... a cavern blocked by a strange air current, you say? Let me think...

Traveler: How are things here on Dragonspine?
Iris: On this mountain? Well, I can only say that it's more dangerous than any other place in Mondstadt.
Iris: Apart from the harsh conditions, this mountain is also home to some strange... ice.
Iris: It is incredibly hard to break, and will not melt when exposed to fire.
Iris: Worst of all, a few roads have been blocked by this ice.
Iris: Quite a few of our expedition teams have been forced to turn back after being blocked by ice barricades that they could not get around.
Iris: *sigh* I wonder when we're going to find a way to get rid of that ice...
Traveler: So, about the strange ice...
Iris: What? You encountered the strange ice... and you were able to melt it?
Iris: H—How can this be? How did you do it? Huh... There were strange crystals nearby?
Iris: You can use those to melt through the ice? I see, I see... Looks like I'll have to investigate this thoroughly...
Iris: Well, let's put that aside first. Looking at you, I suppose you want to continue going deeper into the mountain, yes?

### Talk 6 related talk 17

Traveler: Do you have a commission for me?
Iris: A commission, you say? Your timing couldn't have been better! I was just thinking I should find an experienced adventurer to investigate the strange air current.
Traveler: What strange air current?
Iris: Let me give you a bit of background. Not long ago, a small team of explorers went on an expedition up the mountain. A few highly experienced adventurers joined them, and they took a safe route that avoided all the known dangerous spots.
Iris: But somehow, they fell foul of a sudden and powerful current of cold air along their way and were forced to return to the camp.
Iris: I spoke to the adventurers when they got back. They said that it shouldn't have been possible for an air current that strong to appear on the trail they were following. Apparently, it just came out of nowhere. It doesn't seem like it was a naturally occurring phenomenon.
Iris: Since then, numerous explorers and surveyors have reported encountering the same situation. After organizing a few investigations of our own, we now believe that we have pinpointed the source of the air current.
Iris: Unfortunately, all the adventurers who have taken part in the investigations so far are still recuperating from frostbite, muscular fatigue, and other issues, so our investigations have temporarily ground to a halt...
Iris: Traveler, if you are willing, could you continue investigating the source of the air current on our behalf?
Traveler: Sure.
Iris: Many thanks. Make sure you're well-prepared before you set off — whatever is causing this is most unnatural.
Iris: If you've no further questions, I will leave you to proceed with the investigation. Many thanks for your assistance.
Traveler: What's in this for me?
Iris: Oh... Straight to the point, I see. Don't worry, the Guild is not in the business of short-changing its adventurers. I will have a reward waiting for you when you return to the camp.
Iris: As for the size of said reward... That will be determined based on the value of your findings. You know the score, right?

Iris: As far as I'm concerned, this is just a place worth adventuring in.
Iris: One thing to note is that this place is more dangerous than any other place in Mondstadt. In this extreme cold, your first priority must be maintaining your body temperature.
