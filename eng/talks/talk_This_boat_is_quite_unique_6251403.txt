Traveler: This boat is quite unique.
Bosu: Good taste!
Bosu: Chenyu Vale's shallow and has a lot of bends, so big ships would get stranded here all too easy.
Bosu: But not a raft! It's light and sits high on the water, so no bends or unseen reef can stop us.
Bosu: Most importantly, the scenery of Chenyu Vale can only be appreciated in detail from a raft.
