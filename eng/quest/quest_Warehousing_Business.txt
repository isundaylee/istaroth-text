# Warehousing Business


## Talk 1

Najat: Ugh, these Red Vultures! They just won't leave, will they?
Traveler: Excuse me, what happened?
Najat: Are you... the Traveler? I've heard about you from Ebeid.
Najat: Hehe, we don't usually see many travelers around, so I wasn't expecting you.
Najat: Oh, have you met Habachi? The lad's always so strict — makes him seem unapproachable at times. Please don't feel offended though.
Najat: You see, we've got all sorts of stuff stored here, not just food but also clothes, weapons, and even Mora and goods...
Najat: There aren't many young people in this place, and they need to manage all kinds of things, from protecting the village to the daily affairs of villagers. As a result, Habachi has been the only person on the warehouse-guarding duty.
Najat: I can't help him much except for keeping accounts and tallying goods.
Traveler: What's with the Red Vultures?
Najat: *sigh* Don't get me started. We just received a batch of jerky in the warehouse...
Najat: I guess it's the scent or something that has attracted these birds. Anyway, they started lurking on the hill near the warehouse from time to time.
Najat: They can't have their way with the jerky locked in the warehouse, but whoever eats in front of them becomes an easy target instead.
Najat: Our guards are too busy to come and get rid of them, nor is Habachi available...
Najat: Traveler, if you have time, could you deal with them for us?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Najat: Thank you so much. Those vultures are fierce. You might want to keep your distance. I'd suggest using a bow and arrow to get rid of them. It's safer.
Traveler: Have they attacked anything?
Najat: Yes, lots of things, actually — the goods we're transporting, the meat we're drying, and also Habachi's lunchboxes...
Najat: Every time Habachi's having lunch while on duty, the vultures always come snatch his meat away when he's not watching.
Najat: The poor lad can't leave his post to chase after them, so he has to make do with what's left...
Najat: So, please get rid of the vultures for us.

## Talk 2

Najat: So, please get rid of the vultures for us.

## Talk 3

Najat: How did it go? Did you take care of them?
Traveler: Yep, all done.
Najat: Thank you so much! Habachi can finally have a peaceful lunch.
Najat: Here, this is for you.
Najat: Um... What else will arrive today?
Traveler: You won't see them for a while.

## Talk 4

Najat: *sigh* Habachi should really allow himself some rest...
Traveler: What happened?
Najat: Traveler, perfect timing! Could you help me with something?
Najat: We just got some dried foods from outside the village. Habachi was about to deliver them here.
Najat: But a group of Red Vultures was attracted by the smell and came whooshing down.
Najat: Although the guards managed to drive them away quickly, they had scattered the food everywhere.
Najat: Some people have left to warn other delivery teams, and Habachi's busy retrieving what is still edible. Traveler, could you help us?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Najat: Thank you so much. My apologies, I've got another batch of goods coming in, so I can't go myself.
Traveler: Is Habachi okay?
Najat: *sigh* I asked him to take a break, but he wouldn't listen. He said he'd go over the goods in the warehouse once he was done putting the scattered food back. He's overworking himself.
Najat: The goods should be near the White Lift. Please bring them to me, Traveler.

## Talk 5

Najat: The goods should be near the White Lift. Please bring them to me, Traveler.

## Talk 6

Najat: Traveler, did you get the goods?
Traveler: Yes, got them right here.
Najat: Great! Please leave them there. Thank you so much.
Najat: Habachi is tallying some other stuff in the warehouse. I'll take care of the food here.
Najat: *sigh* Fingers crossed that we didn't lose too much food...

## Talk 7

Najat: Ah, Traveler, thank goodness you've come! Please go help Habachi!
Traveler: What happened?
Najat: *sigh* A group of Treasure Hoarders suddenly showed up outside the village and stopped one of our delivery teams. We've summoned every guard available to help.
Najat: But Habachi said that was not enough, so he also grabbed a weapon to join the guards.
Najat: I heard there are too many Treasure Hoarders this time. Habachi can't handle them on his own.
Najat: Traveler, I've marked the location on the map. Please help him.
Traveler: I'll go right away.
Najat: I'm counting on you. Hope nothing happens to Habachi.
Traveler: Is he a good fighter?
Najat: He can handle a thug or two alright.
Najat: But it's a whole group of ambushing Treasure Hoarders we're talking about. Had it not been for the fast runner in the delivery team, no one would've known what happened.
Najat: *sigh* How I wish Ms. Candace were around — none of the Treasure Hoarders would dare to lift a finger.
Najat: They must've been waiting for her departure.
Najat: Traveler, please help Habachi.
Traveler: You look anxious.

## Talk 8

Najat: Traveler, please help Habachi. I... I'll see if I can get other people to help.

## Talk 9

Habachi: Huff... Thank you so much, Traveler. We wouldn't be able to keep the goods without you.
Traveler: You fought well.
Habachi: Haha, I'm flattered. But I wouldn't be able to handle all of them.
Habachi: *sigh* I wish I were stronger. If it were Candace, all of these Treasure Hoarders would be lying on the ground now.
Habachi: My bad, there's no time for this. I've got to send the goods back to the village.
Habachi: Traveler, it's not safe around here. You should return as quickly as possible.
Habachi: But when I think about it, the Treasure Hoarders sure keep their ears on the ground...
Traveler: Are you on your own?
Habachi: There were other guards with me, but they went elsewhere to look for the goods.
