Freycinet: Hello, are you here for the hot-air balloon ride too?

## Talk

Traveler: You really love it, huh?
Freycinet: Yeah. And for me, it's not just the balloon riding experience. Their operating principles are fascinating in their own right!
Freycinet: Based on my observations and experiences, despite the balloons being rather slow, they still have Fontainian aircraft beat both in terms of altitude control and navigation...
Freycinet: But my shooting skills are complete trash, so I'd prefer not to bug Mr. Pixica too often.
Freycinet: I'll go chat with him once I've taken down enough notes.

Freycinet: Oh, speaking of which! Because I've been helping residents with some reconstruction efforts, Mr. Pixica gave me priority access to hot-air balloon rides!

Traveler: We'll go later.
Freycinet: Have fun!

Traveler: Congratulations.
Freycinet: Hehe...
Freycinet: Before I came here, someone told me that the people of the Flower-Feather Clan aren't used to interacting with outsiders. But it doesn't seem that way at all.
Freycinet: A little fella even gave me some delicious cake. Want to try some?
