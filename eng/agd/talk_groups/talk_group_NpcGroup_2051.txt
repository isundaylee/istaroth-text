Mu Chen: Like I was saying, if we want structural reconfigurability, we'll need an unbelievably strong material. But we'd also compromise on the strength of the joints...
Gao Fei: Metal fatigue is a fact you can't work around though... This is only an issue because you blindly insist that the Super-Armored Mechanoid must be reconfigurable...
Mu Chen: Stupid, if the Super-Armored Mechanoid isn't flexible enough then it's just a sitting duck!
Mu Chen: Granted, the design ethos is for this to serve as the ultimate defensive superweapon, but ultimately seaworthiness and flight-readiness are key functionalities that we cannot ignore...
Mu Chen: The only way this is ever going to act as a deterrent against people from other nations tryna invade Liyue is if it has the actual capability to reach every corner of Teyvat.
Gao Fei: Hmm... Well, how about we switch up the design a little? Separate the body from the movable components?
Gao Fei: By using discrete external components to achieve the functions of amphibious transportation and flight, we can bypass the issue of metal fatigue and negate the requirement for reconfigurability at the structural level entirely.
Mu Chen: I like this train of thought, I do. It's just that this will limit the effective range for combat and the reconfiguration will be irreversible...
