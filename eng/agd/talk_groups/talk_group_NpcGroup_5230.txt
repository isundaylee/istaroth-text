"Tricky Bulle Fruit": Huh? Benefactor! How did you get in? Oh, forget it. I forgot how masterful you are. You definitely have your ways.

## Talk

Traveler: And how did you get in this time?
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": Haha, good question! Don't forget, I don't have this name for nothing! I've got my ways too.

Traveler: So how's business?
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": Shh... Keep quiet. I'm still figuring this place out.
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": Seems like most people here only go to the Rag and Bone Shop to buy their bric a brac. I can't go prancing about with my wares setting up shop willy-nilly... Wouldn't be good to attract the wrong kind of attention from certain parties...
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": Especially that Alvard...

Traveler: How's Blanche?
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": She's good. I found her a tutor before coming in. Heehee, can you guess what kind of tutor? Photography!
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": I've told the tutor to fill her world with pictures every day, all of beautiful scenery from exotic locales abroad. This way, she's bound to want to visit them someday.
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": And in the future, she won't be so against the idea of going overseas to study.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": Goodbye, Benefactor!

## Talk

Traveler: What red-haired guy?
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": Oh, I used to have a buddy with red hair. Maybe I haven't been getting enough sleep recently, because I keep seeing him around down here in the prison. My eyes must be playing tricks on me.

Traveler: You haven't changed a bit.
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": You can't forget where you came from and, of course, what others did for you. Please take this, as a token of my appreciation.
