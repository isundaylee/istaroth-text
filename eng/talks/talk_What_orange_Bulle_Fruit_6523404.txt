Traveler: What orange Bulle Fruit?
"Intrepid Valberry": I used to have a buddy who really liked Bulle Fruit, and recently I saw that someone had drawn one on the noticeboard. It made me miss him all of a sudden.
"Intrepid Valberry": Never mind. Poor guy's probably long since left this world. Forget it. Remember to treasure those around you, eh?
