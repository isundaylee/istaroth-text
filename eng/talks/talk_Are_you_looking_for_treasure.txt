Traveler: Are you looking for treasure?
Fujiwara Toshiko: Oh, so you heard about that? I do have a treasure map from my ancestors. The treasure it leads to will belong to me and no one else.
Fujiwara Toshiko: However, my ancestors were the pirates who once occupied Seirai Island. The clues on the treasure map... are probably still on that island.
Fujiwara Toshiko: Hmph, it's all the Kanjou Commission's fault. They came up with some stupid reasons to force the island's residents out. Now I have no use for this treasure map.
Fujiwara Toshiko: Come to think of it, there's been a legend of a pirate treasure circulating for generations on Seirai Island... After my ancestors left, could the Kanjou Commission have already taken the treasure for themselves?
