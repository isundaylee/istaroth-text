Gentle Guard: The city beneath the starry sky is supremely splendid... The suspended stars sway, and the seas are still...
Gentle Guard: Here, we have the sounds of clockwork winding up in the morning, and at night, the blended scent of vegetable oil and woodchips wafts over in waves...
Gentle Guard: Each time I experience these, I feel like our world is so beautiful, so perfect, it's almost like it was lifted right from the pages of a story...
Gentle Guard: ...Traveler, will you remember what stories transpired beneath this starry sky?
Traveler: ...Who knows?
Gentle Guard: It's okay. At least the starry sky will remember. And I will remember too.
Traveler: I will.
Gentle Guard: Haha... I hope that when you think of this starry sky, you too will feel that sense of serene bliss.
