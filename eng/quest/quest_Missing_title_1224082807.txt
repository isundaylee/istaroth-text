Traveler: About the cats...
Yong'an: Come to think of it, I saw a girl trying to give them some milk while I was on morning patrol...ACHOO!
Yong'an: Thank goodness I was able to stop her. Well, not that she meant them any ill, but cats will get upset stomachs from drinking milk!
Yong'an: ...Maybe it's because I've been around cats for so long, but I've also stopped liking milk myself. Here, you take them...ACHOO!
