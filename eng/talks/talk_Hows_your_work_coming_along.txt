# Talk Dialog

Traveler: How's your work coming along?
Marvin: I wrote a little when the inspiration hit, but I feel like... Um, this is rather embarrassing...
Traveler: Mind reading it out to me?
Marvin: Sure! As... as long as you don't laugh... heh.
Marvin: "You and I
Like the stars and moon
The wind and the clouds
Like flowers and mist
Never shall we part."
Marvin: Hâ€”How is it... Will it do?
Traveler: Seems a little plain.
Marvin: Is that so? Hmm, I thought so too... I've got to practice more so that I can write Marla a better poem.
Marvin: Thanks! I'll make some edits before handing this in. Please give me a while more, Professor Venti!
Traveler: Expressive, if a bit immature.
