Traveler: Sumeru?
Yayoi Nanatsuki: I once traveled to and studied at Sumeru Akademiya. The secret crafting techniques that I learned there has helped me create unique paints.
Yayoi Nanatsuki: Lacquerware-making techniques are truly fascinating. My goal is to combine everything I have learned and become the best of the best.
Yayoi Nanatsuki: If my skill can reach that apex, I am sure that my lacquerware will bear out the pattern of the truth.
