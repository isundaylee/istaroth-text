# What is the Meaning of Work?


## Talk 1

Iaune: Oh, good gulls. I know that you are hungry, but I, too, have not eaten my fill.
Iaune: Forget it. I suppose that it's all good if you're happy...
Traveler: What are you doing?
Iaune: Traveler? Why, what a pleasant surprise. If you're here to make a request of me, I'm afraid you'll have to wait. I'm not quite done with my fries yet.
Traveler: Oh, I'm not here on business.
Iaune: Oh, is that so? That's good. I need to hurry up and finish them as soon as possible...
Iaune: Well, this is my main meal. I'll be going out with Roialte on business later, so I need to rush this meal.
Iaune: I'm not used to eating inside the Palais Mermonia, so I tend to go outside and find a quiet spot to get my meal squared away real quick.
Iaune: But today... I don't know what's making these gulls go wild, but they're coming at my fries all at once, and no matter how much they eat, it's not enough.
Traveler: Well, there's a lot of them, and only this many fries...
Iaune: That's true. But I can't feed every single seagull in the ocean, can I...
Paimon: Well, these are your fries, aren't they? Don't let the gulls get at them just like that.
Paimon: You'll go hungry at this rate, y'know?
Traveler: You seem a little down, actually.
Iaune: Really? I'm not... Well, actually, I suppose I am. Nothing escapes you, I see.
Iaune: I just... don't know what the meaning of my work is. I busy myself every day at the Maison Gestion, but I don't really see it bearing tangible fruit.
Iaune: I haven't been able to help anyone, nor has anyone's life been made more convenient by my work. Roialte says that our work is very important, but...
Iaune: I just sit in front of a typewriter and clatter away, endlessly. What purpose does that serve? I might as well just lose another keycap. At least that'll make Estelle a bit of Mora...
Iaune: Sorry. I know I shouldn't be saying all this, but I just feel rather lost right now no matter what I do. Maybe... Maybe I need more time.
Traveler: Finish eating first.
Iaune: You're right. But the amount of time we have now is insufficient to go get some new fries.
Iaune: Forget it, I'll just give the rest of them to the birds. I'll just get something to eat once Roialte and I are done with our business.
Iaune: It'll take us... What, half a day? Not too long, I'd reckon.
Paimon: Will you be able to hold up after not eating for that long?
Traveler: Leave the gulls to me.
Iaune: Um... Wouldn't that be too much trouble? All that over some fries...
Paimon: Just eat your meal. You shouldn't go hungry, no matter how busy you are.
Traveler: I'll take care of those gulls.
Traveler: Let's solve your gull problem first.
Traveler: You seem a little off your game.
Traveler: Not all of them have gotten something to eat just yet...
Traveler: And why are you eating fries over here?

## Talk 2

Iaune: Thank you. I'll finish up my fries while they're gone.
Iaune: *sigh* But what do I do next time? I can't always count on your help, can I?

## Talk 3

Iaune: There's... really no end to these gulls and their appetites, is there?
Iaune: Thanks for distracting them. I've finished my fries — I'll get back to work shortly.
Iaune: *sigh* But what do I do next time? I can't always count on your help, can I?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Iaune: Y—You really don't do things by halves, do you? All the gulls in the area have been scared off...
Iaune: Thank you. I'll finish up my fries while they're not around to disturb me.
Iaune: *sigh* But what do I do next time? I can't always count on your help, can I?

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: Have you tried getting a dog?
Iaune: You mean... I should get a dog to chase them off?
Iaune: That's not a bad plan. I might be able to get someone to lend me one...

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: Um, try eating somewhere else?
Iaune: I can't find anywhere better to eat now, anyway. If I'm too close to the Palais Mermonia, I might bump into one of my colleagues.
Iaune: And then I'll get dragged into their discussions of work again...
Iaune: But if I go too far away, I won't be able to get back to the office on time, and I might miss something important.
Iaune: Considering these two factors, this place is my only option.

### Additional Talk 4

Iaune: Ah, Violetgold Angler Gulls. Once you're done with these fries, please leave...
Traveler: How's the situation right now?
Iaune: No, not at all. When the gulls came for my fries, it turned tail and hid behind me, trembling.
Iaune: *sigh* Not that I blame the dog. Its breed have only ever had one duty — to love others and be loved by them. It has never learned to attack anything in its life.
Traveler: We have this duty too, you know.
Iaune: Perhaps. But in some circumstances, love, too, may be considered a "right." And where those things are concerned, things tend to proceed in difficult directions...
Iaune: Sorry, I've said too much. I've had to handle many disputes of an emotional bent today, and I fear I haven't quite sorted myself out yet.
Iaune: *sigh* But right now, my most pressing task is to figure out how to safely finish my fries...
Traveler: Did getting a dog work out for you?

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: We will chase them all away.
Iaune: Sure, but could you focus on... only chasing them away? They just want my fries, but there's no malice in them.
Iaune: Well, it is a bad thing for me, but it's not a very serious matter, so... Please, just chase them away, would you?

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: We'll find something else to feed them.
Iaune: Hmm? That's not a bad idea. But can you really feed that many of them?
Iaune: Well... Even if you can't, you just need to buy me enough time to eat my fries. Alright then, I leave this to you.

### Additional Talk 7

Iaune: The document that Roialte wants is... No, wait, I think I have this data wrong...
