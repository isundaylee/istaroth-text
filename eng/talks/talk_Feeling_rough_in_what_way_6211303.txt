Traveler: Feeling rough in what way?
Wuwang: It's hard to describe... It's like I feel dizzy all the time, and I'm so drowsy during the day that I have to try to force myself to stay awake, but I just can't do it...
Wuwang: And then when I finally come round, it's dark out. So I have to travel during the night to catch up.
Wuwang: But at nighttime there's never anyone around to ask for directions. I once saw a guy sleeping by the side of the road and tried to wake him up...
Wuwang: But it was like he couldn't hear a word I was saying. And I tried to shake him awake, but I somehow couldn't touch him, either... Do you think he was a ghost?
Wuwang: ...Ugh, never mind all that, I should get going.
