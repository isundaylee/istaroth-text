Traveler: So what happened?
Chang the Ninth: Thanks to you, I was able to sell that Cor Lapis at a good price. You effectively saved my life in the process.
Chang the Ninth: I know my gut feeling won't lead me astray. Sure, I've had a few business deals go south, but that which makes money will make money.
Chang the Ninth: Just watch, I used that money to buy more ore. Once my ore business really gets going, I can finally get out of this dump.
Chang the Ninth: But when my time comes, everyone in Liyue Harbor is going to know that old Chang the Ninth is finally back again!
