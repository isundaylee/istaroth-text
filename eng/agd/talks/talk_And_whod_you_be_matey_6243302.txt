Traveler: And who'd you be, matey?
Juza: I'd be the Alcor's Chief Mate. I'm in charge of the lads when Captain Beidou isn't around.
Juza: I used to be a dockworker, just muddling along without a clue about what I was living for. If it weren't for Captain Beidou's invitation, I'd still be tightening screws in some miserable corner...
Juza: Sailing with the Captain, adventuring as we please... Best decision of my life, I tell you!
Juza: Oh, that's right. It so happens, traveler, that we're hiring right now. Interested in joining up as a sailor?
Juza: If you come on board, I'll have more than enough to tell you stories about the Captain, hahaha!
