Nika: Sabzeruz Festival, Sabzeruz Festival!
Zai: Sabzeruz Festival, Sabzeruz Festival!
Nika: Where should we go today? Want to dress up the Sumpter Beasts for the festivities together?
Zai: Woohoo! Is it a Sabzeruz tradition for people who keep Sumpter Beasts?
Nika: Eh? I, uh... I don't remember Dad ever doing it...
Nika: But don't you think it really adds to the festive mood?
Nika: The Dendro Archon will bless the trees with delicious apples, making the Sumpter Beasts happy too!
Zai: Oooh, that's right! If Sumpter Beasts are all dressed up and looking their best, and enjoy their food, they'll probably be tastier too!
Nika: ?
