### Additional Talk 1

Buttercup of Terror: Onikabuto are our friends! Like cats and doggies!
Arataki Itto: Another kid? Ugh, didn't we go through this last time?
Paimon: Well yeah, but Grandmaster Hanakado's a kid too, and one of the other kids from last time was actually pretty good. So age is no measure of a beetle-fighter's skill.
Grandmaster Hanakado: Although... uh, Buttercup of Terror has no prior beetle-battling experience, her chosen Onikabuto has the air of a formidable warrior!
Buttercup of Terror: I dunno what you guys are talking about.
Buttercup of Terror: My Onikabuto was a present from Daddy. He got it from a new friend he made last time he was away.
Arataki Itto: Hoho, your father sounds like a real stand up guy!
Arataki Itto: Okay, let's send out Skycleaving White-Iron Lavender Melon for this one. We don't want any accusations of bullying flying around.
Paimon: Hmph, you make it sound like Paimon's the weakest choice on our side...
Paimon: Still, Paimon is probably the safest choice... but only because you two maniacs are a danger to yourselves and others when you're in a competitive mood.
Paimon: Don't be nervous, young lady! It's only a game, so it's just for fun!

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: Phew... Paimon nearly messed that up...
Arataki Itto: I nearly died of a heart attack! That little beastie is fierce! Even I woulda had a tough time...
Arataki Itto: How'd you get so freakin' good at this without a teacher? Is everyone in Liyue a born warrior or something?
Buttercup of Terror: So this is how Onikabuto play together? I get it now!
Buttercup of Terror: Do you have time to play some more? And I also wanna watch you guys play, too!
Paimon: Looks like Buttercup of Terror has a real knack for this... Kinda terrifying!
Paimon: Hey, Bull-Chucker, if you had this kind of talent, you could probably have learned how to communicate with shelled creatures just by listening to Guoba talk to Crystal Tornado.
Arataki Itto: Hah... Haha, hah... Yeah, I wish!
