Traveler: New life?
Gulabgir: I used to be a snake handler in the rain forest. I recently moved to the harbor and make my living as a busker.
Gulabgir: I thought life at the port would be more convenient than wandering in the wild. Only after coming here did I find out that it's not easy for the locals here, too.
Gulabgir: In the rain forest, we were awakened by Dusk Birds early in the morning and searched for food. At the port, people get up to work alongside the sound of trumpets of the fleet.
Gulabgir: I'll never return to the simple life in the rainforest, but I shall always remember the time spent singing stories under the moon with my companions.
Gulabgir: Colorful mushrooms and fruits roasting on the fire. A rainbow-like tapestry before our eyes... Ah, good times.
