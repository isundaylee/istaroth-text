Traveler: Tell me more about Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Keon: Lesser Lord Kusanali has started guiding Sumeru once more, and I believe that things can only get better from here.
Keon: Youngster, I'm sure you know that every blade of grass and every leaf in this land is a blessing from the Dendro Archon.
Keon: *sigh* Life is too short... and yet I hope that I shall live long enough to see her deliver us back to glory.
