Traveler: How are your adventures going?
Ylgr: Quite smoothly. I've finished annotating the maps of Drunkard Gorge, Springvale and the surrounding areas...
Ylgr: Annotation is actually quite tiring, but it's also very satisfying... Are you interested in my work, by any chance?
Ylgr: If you are, please take these — it's some of the knowledge I've gained on my adventures. Someday, everyone in Mondstadt will use the maps I've made!

Ylgr: Ah! You scared the life out of me! You shouldn't sneak up on people when they're absorbed in something like that!

Traveler: You're the one doing the sneaking.
Ylgr: How dare you accuse me of sneaking!
Ylgr: I'm Ylgr, and you'd better remember that name because I'm about to go down in history as one of the greatest adventurers of all time!
Traveler: "About to"?
Ylgr: Yeah, I mean I'm... not famous enough yet, so... Ugh, did you really have to ask that?
Ylgr: *sigh* If only I had a Vision. When will the gods finally recognize me?
Ylgr: With elemental power at my disposal, I would be able to carve out my own path...
Traveler: What are you doing?
Ylgr: I am surveying the mountains around Springvale and checking for discrepancies against an old map.
Ylgr: Obviously most geological features don't change even after millennia of transformation in the world... But still, existing documentation is vague and imprecise on the location of certain places...
Ylgr: Once my newly updated map of Mondstadt is finished, I'm sure it will become famous all over Teyvat!

Traveler: Have you encountered anyone who looks like me?
Ylgr: Looking for someone? ...I'm sorry, I don't think your appearance rings a bell.
Ylgr: I've been checking maps of Mondstadt for discrepancies lately, so I've only had eyes for the mountains and the rivers.
Ylgr: A person needs to give their tasks their full attention, wouldn't you say?
