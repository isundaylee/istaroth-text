Traveler: And you are...
Soltani: I'm a servant of this house at your service.
Soltani: Seeing as how you've been wandering aimlessly. Please pardon me... Is the butler giving random directions again?
Soltani: *sigh* If you had the "privilege" to speak to the butler, then please don't take him seriously.
Soltani: This place may seem grand and magnificent, but it's still quite remote and isolated compared to the city. The Lord prefers a life of tranquility and reclusiveness, so our household staff is limited in numbers.
Soltani: I suggest you pay attention to your surroundings when going while in the vicinity, especially when you're not within the range of this property.
