Traveler: Brothers and sister...
Arapacati: #Nara Varuna looked so happy, so joyful, when talking about brothers. Nara are weird. Why are "brothers" and "sisters" so special?
Arapacati: We later decided, we should be "brothers" and "sisters," to make everyone happy and joyful.
Arapacati: At first, Arapacati was "brother." But the "sister" back then is gone now. Before being Vasara Tree, he decided that Arapacati should be "sister."
Arapacati: Who should be "sister" next time...

Traveler: Let's hope this goes smoothly...
Arapacati: Yes, it will be fine. Aranara are all afraid of fire, except for us brothers and sisters. That's why Arapacati made this pot. With this pot, the fire will be very, very small — not too hot and not too scary.
Arapacati: #Arapacati made one for Nara Traveler as a show of thanks. I hope that the scent of happiness will always be with Nara Traveler.
