# Contingencies


## Talk 1

Huffman: Hello, Traveler. Please refrain from leaving the city during this time, if you will.
Traveler: What's wrong?
Huffman: Now, I believe that you've seen those fallen meteorites as well.
Huffman: For some reason, they've started falling at a greater rate than before, and it's become more dangerous out there in the wild.
Huffman: All sorts of matters are cropping up within the city, almost more than the Knights can handle. All this, at a time when we'd just discovered Treasure Hoarder activity near the city...
Huffman: Those fellows would do anything for a little Mora. I fear that they'll try to take advantage of this situation...
Huffman: If you're willing, Traveler, could you help us chase those thieves off?
Huffman: This should be a task for the Knights, but I fear that we can't spare the people to settle this matter. Can you help us?
Traveler: You can count on me.
Huffman: You have my thanks. I'm sorry, I know it's not the best look for us to be asking you to help us in these circumstances.
Traveler: The Treasure Hoarders aren't scared of the meteorites?
Huffman: Hmph. I'd wager that those crooks fear nothing, as long as they can get their hands on some Mora.
Huffman: You have my thanks. I'm sorry, I know it's not the best look for us to be asking you to help us in these circumstances.

## Talk 2

Huffman: Have you succeeded in beating back those Treasure Hoarders?
Traveler: Sure did.
Huffman: Wonderful. You've been a great help.
Huffman: Hopefully, those Treasure Hoarders will take a hint from this lesson and stop eyeing Mondstadt up.
Traveler: Well then, if there's nothing else...
Huffman: Um, so, please hold on a moment... There is something else I need your help with.
Huffman: In truth, we've received a plenitude of reports about abnormal monsters during this period.
Huffman: These reports mention that the meteorites have caused the monsters to become especially aggressive.
Huffman: The city's defenses are sufficiently stalwart, so there's no reason to worry there. But one such meteorite has landed right beside Springvale...
Huffman: Springvale is home to many hunters, and we've sent knights to reinforce them, but the terrain is truly difficult to police.
Huffman: If any monsters were to enter the town, things could get disastrous...
Huffman: Could you head over to Springvale and help us investigate the status of the monsters there?
Traveler: Sure.
Huffman: I'll leave it in your capable hands, then. I will do what I can to send some knights over to assist you.
Traveler: What's the situation over in Springvale?
Huffman: To be frank, things don't look good. We already have our hands full dealing with the meteorites' aftermath. But we also need to guard against monsters and the Treasure Hoarders...
Huffman: It's almost impossible to handle so many things at once...
Huffman: I'm sorry, but I'm leaving this in your hands. In the meantime, I will try to send knights over to aid you.

## Talk 3

Timid Morrow: Aaaah! D—Don't come any...
Timid Morrow: Eh? Y—You're not a monster. Wh—Who are you?
Traveler: What's the status on those monsters?
Timid Morrow: The monsters? What is there to ask? I was just running from them, that's what!
Timid Morrow: They were right there, a whole bunch of them, looking like they might attack the town.
Timid Morrow: If I hadn't run so fast, I'd have been a goner...
Traveler: Where are those beasts?
Timid Morrow: Right next to the town. A few steps around the corner and you'll see them.
Timid Morrow: You should get to shelter as well. I'll rest here for a while, and then I'll go warn everyone in town.

## Talk 4

Timid Morrow: Huh? It's you, again? What were you doing this whole time?
Traveler: Defeating all the monsters?
Timid Morrow: Defeating all the... What? Just you?
Traveler: You can go check it out.
Timid Morrow: Ugh, I daren't look. If they see me, I'd be done for!
Timid Morrow: I'll just report what you've said to the Knights — never mind if it's true or not.
Timid Morrow: Th—They'll have some way to check if you've beaten all those monsters, I'm sure.

## Talk 5

Huffman: How's the situation?
Traveler: Springvale is safe.
Huffman: That's great... I was honestly worried that we might not be able to spare anyone to help out.
Huffman: Thank you so much. You've really helped us out this time. Please take these as a token of our esteem.
Huffman: *sigh* Meteorites, monsters... I can only hope that nothing truly messy happens.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Huffman: How do you do, Honorary Knight? Please, do your utmost to remain within the city limits during this time.
Huffman: Now, I believe that you've seen those fallen meteorites as well.
Huffman: For some reason, they've started falling at a greater rate than before, and it's become more dangerous out there in the wild.
Huffman: All sorts of matters are cropping up within the city, almost more than the Knights can handle. All this, at a time when we'd just discovered Treasure Hoarder activity near the city...
Huffman: Those fellows would do anything for a little Mora. I fear that they'll try to take advantage of this situation...
Huffman: If you're willing, Traveler, could you help us chase those thieves off?
Traveler: I won't let you down.
Huffman: Spoken well, Honorary Knight. I'll leave it in your able hands.
Traveler: Aren't the Treasure Hoarders scared of the meteorites?
Huffman: Hmph. I'd wager that those crooks fear nothing, as long as they can get their hands on some Mora.
Huffman: You have my thanks. I'm sorry, I know it reflects ill on us to be asking for your help in such circumstances.

### Additional Talk 2

Huffman: I suppose it can be considered some small consolation that no meteorites have come down within the city walls.

### Additional Talk 3

Huffman: Meteorites, monsters and the Treasure Hoarders. It's really pouring, isn't it...

### Additional Talk 4

Timid Morrow: I have to warn everyone...

### Additional Talk 5

Timid Morrow: Did you really defeat all those monsters by yourself?
Timid Morrow: If that's so, you're really strong. Better than the Knights of Favonius, even.
