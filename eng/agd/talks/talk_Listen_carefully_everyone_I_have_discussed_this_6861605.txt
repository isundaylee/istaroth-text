Emergency Notice: "Listen carefully, everyone: I have discussed this with the chief, and everyone needs to be examined again. Only those who make the cut in both mental and physical aptitude will be issued their wings once more!"
Emergency Notice: "Otherwise, you will be required to stay in the vicinity of the arena to receive treatment. All candidates must undergo re-examination, especially anyone who has come into contact with Abyssal forces!"
Emergency Notice: "Of course, if you don't wish to undergo testing again, all you have to do is beat Miss Chasca in combat, and we'll consider you fighting fit!"
Emergency Notice: "Can't quite manage that? Haha, then quit yapping and get your treatment sorted! Once treated, you'll be allowed to fly again."
