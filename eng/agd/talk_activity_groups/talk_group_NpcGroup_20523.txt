## Talk

Zhiqiong: Do you need something?
Traveler: About your maps...
Zhiqiong: Eh? My maps? There's honestly not much to be said about them. Before I joined the Adventurers' Guild, I was the mine cartographer.
Zhiqiong: Of course, I wasn't just some person sitting behind a desk... In fact, we couldn't be more different.
Zhiqiong: I was once commissioned by them to map out the terrain of Qiaoying Village... and after all that work, they canceled the construction project just like that, with only a word.
Zhiqiong: People like them get assistants to do the dirty exploration work and information-gathering for them, and then they start drawing... But those like me? We can't do that.
Zhiqiong: As... well, half a miner myself, I've long gotten used to passing through the dangerous underground passages. It's just the way the job works.
Zhiqiong: Also, after that great change, the lower levels of The Chasm have really been truly unstable.
Paimon: Eh? Unstable? Is that very dangerous?
Zhiqiong: You bet it is. The terrain here is slowly but constantly changing. A path today might be a rock wall next month. It's almost as if... How should I say this...
Zhiqiong: It's almost as if The Chasm itself is changing shape as it likes.
Paimon: Uh... things can't be that spooky, right?
Traveler: Tell me about your life as an adventurer.
Zhiqiong: Haha, what? My "life"? You don't have to be so polite. I'm just a newbie. I've barely started my journey, unlike you.
Zhiqiong: I have completed some commissions from the Guild, of course, but I'm not that experienced yet, so I haven't done much solo exploration. I don't think I've left any tales of my deeds behind either...
Zhiqiong: So I've been thinking that The Chasm might be just the place for me to make my mark for future generations to remember me by.
Zhiqiong: The Chasm might be, to quote the great adventurer Alice, my "Rubicon"!
Traveler: The Rubicon... is that hilichurl language?
Paimon: Paimon's never heard of that one either...
Zhiqiong: Well, I'm not too sure myself, but given that Alice is an adventurer who has seen the entire world, so that must be some place she's been to... right?
Traveler: Your Rubicon, huh? That's pretty impressive.
Paimon: Wait, you don't even know what that is!
Zhiqiong: Haha, regardless, thanks for your encouragement!
Traveler: What do you think about Clitopho?
Zhiqiong: Him? I don't trust him. We've had to deal with the Treasure Hoarders above the mines for who-knows how long. They're up to no good. I know it!
Zhiqiong: Don't you trust a word that he says. Turning over a new leaf... Washing his hands of the situation...
Zhiqiong: While they say such pretty words, they'll be reaching their filthy hands into your back pocket.
Zhiqiong: Even Rex Lapis would have trouble protecting your wallet from them then!
Zhiqiong: I'm not prejudiced or anything... I'm just telling you to be wary. The Treasure Hoarders are never to be trusted.
Traveler: That does sound like prejudice to me, though.
Zhiqiong: ...Maybe it is. You've probably seen a great many more things than I have, so I guess you might be more generous to them. But as for me, I'll always keep an eye at the back of my head, just for them.
Zhiqiong: And I'll keep doing that until this guy can prove that he's got nothing more to do with those despicable "former" companions of his.
Traveler: See you around.
Zhiqiong: See you!
