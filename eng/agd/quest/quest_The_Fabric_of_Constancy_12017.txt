# The Fabric of Constancy


## Talk 1

Ei: So, uh, what are we supposed to be doing?
Paimon: We're taking a photo of you. Just leave the hard work to us, all you need to do is stand over there and strike a pose.
Paimon: Basically, a photo makes a visual record of you at this very moment in time, so it makes a great souvenir.
Ei: Okay, so what exactly is "striking a pose"?
Traveler: The photo is a visual representation.
Ei: Ah, I see. So in other words, I need to do some sort of visually agreeable action in front of you, right?
Ei: The more I think about it, the more embarrassing it seems.
Ei: How should I pose? Help me out here. It should look good but not too over the top. This isn't coming naturally to me at all.
Traveler: Try graceful and dignified.
Ei: Okay... I'll try that.
Traveler: That works.
Ei: Okay, let's get started.
Paimon: Let's pick a good angle to record this moment from.
Traveler: Maybe try another one.
Ei: Alright. Well, I'll leave the decision to you.
Traveler: Try stern and serious.
Ei: This doesn't feel very "me." Is this okay?
Traveler: Try relaxed and casual.
Ei: Casual... How about this? This feels quite natural.

## Talk 2

Ei: So a photo is a visual representation... an impression, like casting a shadow...
Ei: Fascinating. I'm learning a lot today. Let's get this underway.

## Talk 3

Paimon: It's a wrap! Take a look, here's the photo we took of you.
Ei: Wow... this is astonishing. Is it some kind of magic? It seems to be... another copy of me?
Ei: But she doesn't seem to be able to move or talk...
Traveler: It's just a record.
Ei: I thought it would turn out poorly because I felt rather rigid. But it actually looks much more natural than I'd imagined.
Ei: The pose is exactly the same and so is the scenery in the background... I can't imagine how it's achieved.
Paimon: That's what makes it so special.
Ei: Hang on, I'm still struggling to understand this. I need you to explain it again...
Ei: So the one in this photo... are you sure it isn't me?
Ei: If it's not me, then why does she look exactly like me? And if she is me, then... who am I?
Paimon: #Uh... okay, way above Paimon's head— over to you, Traveler!
Traveler: It's a little bit like you and the Shogun.
Paimon: Hey, that's right. Do you think the Shogun counts as you?
Ei: Of course I do. It was never my intention to place control of Inazuma into anybody else's hands.
Paimon: So then, who does that make you, here and now?
Ei: Well I'm still me. There is no doubt about that.
Traveler: So your existence isn't singular.
Ei: My existence, hmm...
Ei: I think I understand.
Ei: I am me. There is only one of me, but I can exist in many different forms. It's not important what form I exist in.
Ei: The Shogun, for example, is one of my forms of existence. The question of whether or not she is me is not determined by any of her components.
Paimon: In that case, this picture is one of your forms of existence, too.
Ei: Hmm. So even I, who seeks Eternity, am constantly changing my form of existence...
Ei: Then, how can I ask Inazuma and everyone who lives here to remain unchanging?
Traveler: Inazuma will always be Inazuma.
Ei: Everything I have encountered on this journey with you has been from beyond my existing sphere of knowledge.
Ei: *sigh* You've seen a lot of my ignorant side today. Maybe you can't tell, but all this has challenged my understanding of things.
Ei: Based on what I have seen today, I am forced to accept that Inazuma is a completely different place from the one I remember.
Ei: But it would be incorrect to conclude from this that the Inazuma of today is no longer Inazuma.
Traveler: Right.
Ei: Both the Vision Hunt Decree and the Statue of the Omnipresent God were conceived as a means of bringing about Eternity. But if I were really getting closer to Eternity, none of this ever would have happened.
Ei: Hmm...
Ei: Perhaps... perhaps I've been holding on to everything too tightly.
Paimon: Sounds to Paimon like Ei's figured things out!
Paimon: And that means that we've done a really great job as her guides!
Ippei: Master Kamaji! Master Kamaji!
Paimon: Hmm? Why's it getting so noisy down there?
Paimon: That sounded like Ippei. What could be the matter?
Ei: Ippei? Is that someone from the Tenryou Commission?
Paimon: Yep. Let's find out what's going on.
Traveler: Human beings will always be human.
Traveler: It's not the real you.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Hey, Ippei, what's the matter?
Ippei: Ah, it's you. I...
Ippei: Huh? Th—The Almighty Shogun!?
Ippei: You must be looking for my master, Kujou Kamaji? I'm very sorry, he's not here at the moment. But if it pleases you, I will gladly deliver a message on your behalf?
Ei: It's okay, I'm not here to see him. We just heard you calling out, so we came to see what was going on.
Traveler: Are you looking for your master?
Ippei: Yes. Master Kamaji still hasn't returned from the negotiations, and I'm starting to get worried.
Ippei: In fairness, he does have a habit of taking long walks and coming back late. It's perfectly possible that he just found somewhere he likes and lost track of time.
Ippei: But for some reason, today I'm particularly nervous.
Ei: Kujou Kamaji... A descendant of the Kujou Clan, I presume.
Ippei: That's right. Apologies, since the head of the clan is in poor health at the moment, and Master Masahito is rarely home, Master Kamaji is currently serving as representative of the Kujou Clan.
Ei: I have heard that things are quite tumultuous within the Tenryou Commission at present. Does this have anything to do with Kujou Kamaji?
Ippei: Forgive us, Almighty Shogun. The Kujou Clan has failed in its duty.
Ippei: The Kujou Clan's reputation is damaged and its power over the Tenryou Commission is in decline. Plus you, um... ahem, you have yet to issue a verdict on the Commission's future...
Ippei: So, Master Kamaji decided to enter negotiations with the Takatsukasa Clan with a view of having them take over...
Paimon: Surely they would be discussing something like that at their headquarters, right? Why are you looking for them here?
Ippei: Actually, they decided to hold this one elsewhere. I'm a little confused as to why, to be honest, but I didn't feel it was my place to question the higher-ups.
Ippei: The meeting place is in the mountains near the Grand Narukami Shrine. I believe the Takatsukasa Clan have some kind of base there.
Ei: Takatsukasa... another familiar name. They have been faithfully serving the Kujou Clan all these years?
Ippei: Yes, yes. That's why Master Kamaji decided to discuss things with them. I understand they must have had a lot of ground to cover, but still, there's no way it should have gone on this long.
Ippei: I've searched all over the city. If he really hasn't returned yet, then...
Traveler: Maybe they haven't finished.
Ippei: Yeah, I thought of that possibility too... but someone of my rank can't just go venturing into Takatsukasa Clan territory like that.
Traveler: We can go check things out for you.
Ippei: No, no need. I'm probably just overthinking things. Besides, if they're still at it, they'll only blame me for interrupting the negotiations.
Ippei: I'm only a lowly servant, but Master Kamaji and I grew up together... It'd be terrible if anything ever happened to him.
Ippei: I'm not as smart as Master, so I can't really share his burdens. But the last thing I'd want would be for him to come to harm when I could've done something about it.
Paimon: Hmm... what do you think, Almighty Shogun?
Ei: Let's go see what's happening.
Ei: With me present, they are unlikely to blame you even if we do happen to interrupt the negotiations.
Ei: Besides, this has only come about because I failed to make a timely decision. This issue started with me, and I shall be the one to finish it.
Traveler: That's commitment, right there.
Ippei: Thank you so much, Shogun! I'll keep looking around in the meantime, too!
Ippei: Let me mark out the location of the base for you. I hope everything goes smoothly!
Traveler: Awesome stuff.
Traveler: Maybe something's happened.
