Traveler: Who's Skybracer?
Madame Ping: This year's Mingxiao Lantern will be the spitting image of him when it's complete!
Madame Ping: Well, that's the plan. I do hope they make the antlers big enough, they were his pride and joy after all.
Madame Ping: The story goes that the antlers were made from the very essence of Rex Lapis' divine power, which made it the hardest material in all of Liyue.
Madame Ping: But then, that fateful battle happened... The gods exchanged powerful blows, and the mountains started collapsing. To avoid impacting the villagers at the foot of the mountain, the adeptus got his friend to chop his antlers off...
Madame Ping: He used those blood-drenched antlers as a wedge to prop up the mountain. And if that wasn't enough of a sacrifice, he then kept on fighting until his blood was drained and his life ran out...
Madame Ping: Thanks to him, Mt. Tianheng still stands tall and proud to this day. And the blood that he lost in the battle turned into the Bishui River.
Madame Ping: Hehehe... Whether you believe the story or not, I'm just happy you're willing to listen to me tell it.
Madame Ping: Surely, the reason Lantern Rite exists because people throughout the ages have chosen to come together as friends rather than stay in isolation.
