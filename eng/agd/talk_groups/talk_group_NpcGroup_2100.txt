Cai Le: Tell me about Liyue.
Cai Le: Liyue is the largest trading port in all the seven nations. Merchants gather here from all over Teyvat, making it a port city with booming business.
Cai Le: Liyue already has a thousand years of history developing under the leadership of Rex Lapis.
Cai Le: Mora, the common currency for trade across all Teyvat, was originally dubbed by the legendary Rex Lapis, who was himself originally known as Morax. The coins are now minted in Liyue's very own Golden House.
Cai Le: Did you also come to Liyue in search of fortune? Well, good luck.
