Beidou: Hey, don't tell me you called me over just for a game of chess.
Ningguang: You have to be more specific, Captain Beidou.
Ningguang: Is it that you find playing chess an uninteresting activity, or that you're unhappy about my lack of novel ideas?
Ningguang: If you don't specify what you mean, how could I know what I should do to please you?
Beidou: Heh, of course...
Beidou: I make a single remark and you reply with a full-blown lecture.
Beidou: Maybe we should deal with all official affairs publicly in the future. Might just make things easier.
Ningguang: I'd be perfectly happy with that â€” I'm just worried that Captain Beidou's business might be negatively affected.
Beidou: Don't give me that.
Beidou: That woman from Yanshang Teahouse sometimes comes aboard to ask for information. She requested the fleet to import some goods, but how could I not know who she's actually working for?
Ningguang: Oh? You sure know a lot, Captain Beidou.
Ningguang: How about I ask her to come over? Or maybe we go straight to her Teahouse?
Ningguang: With one more person around, we'll be able to have some variety in our chess games. I hope that that would be less of a bore to you.
Beidou: Tsk, so we're still going to play chess after all!
