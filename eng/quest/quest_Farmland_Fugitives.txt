# Farmland Fugitives

Farabi: You're here, Traveler.
Farabi: Here's some good news. Because people have found concrete evidence of the survival of Snowboars, I just received a letter from my mentor saying that my thesis has been approved.
Paimon: Wow, sounds like everything's going smoothly for you, eh? Congrats!
Farabi: It's a good start, but the research that follows will take a long time, so I have to be prepared to stay in Mondstadt for a while.
Farabi: Next, I have to figure out how the Snowboars managed to leave the snowy mountains and ended up in the forest.
Farabi: Based on the tracks that have been found, I'm guessing that they descended the mountain from its western face, passed Dawn Winery, and then made their way to Springvale.
Farabi: If this hypothesis is correct, we should be able to find traces of them in the area. So, our goal today is to investigate this.
Paimon: Paimon gets it. Uh, also, who is this guy beside you? He looks all dressed for a hunt.
Walter: Hello, my name is Walter. Recently, I've taken up the responsibility of overseeing security near Dawn Winery.
Walter: Edmund told me that you guys are looking for Snowboars. Could you come with me today? I happen to need some extra hands to help out.
Walter: *sigh* Some Forest Boars broke into the nearby farms last night, scaring off all their pigeons and ducks. They still haven't found all of them.
Walter: Traveler, when we are hunting later, please capture these small animals when you find them and bring them back with you.
Traveler: Of course. It's my pleasure.
Walter: I heard that you know how to use hunting tools. I've got some around here too, so help yourself. We can set off once you're ready.
Traveler: All ready! Let's go!
Traveler: Wait, I have other things to do.
Walter: Yeah, take your time. I'll be waiting right here.
