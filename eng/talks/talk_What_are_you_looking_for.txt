Traveler: What are you looking for?
Reekwind: I don't suppose you've seen a Millelith-issue polearm around here, have you?
Reekwind: This is so strange... It must be around here somewhere...
Reekwind: *sigh* If any of my squad mates find out, they're gonna give me another annoying nickname, I just know it...
Traveler: How does a soldier manage to lose his weapon?
Reekwind: Shh... Don't let the sergeant hear. Look, it's not like I did it on purpose, okay?
Reekwind: Believe it or not, I used to be a bit of a lazy slacker. Didn't care much for my appearance. Then, my squad mates starting calling me Reekwind...
Reekwind: I managed to whip myself into shape, break the habit of a lifetime and quit being so lazy... But then, the forgetfulness took its place.
Reekwind: Earlier today, I took a short break at that food stall over there. Kinda zoned out for a bit, and when I snapped back, I looked down and somehow there was a laundry pole in my hand... Not a clue where my Millelith polearm went...
Reekwind: If my squad mates find out I managed to lose my polearm... Who knows what kind of awful new nickname they'll come up with?
