Traveler: About Stormterror...
Bruce: If you ask me, I don't think it's anything serious.
Bruce: The Archon War makes Stormterror look like child's play. If you think about it, there haven't been a lot of casualties at all.
Bruce: In any case, we have our reliable colleagues and our eminent Acting Grand Master. This issue will be solved very soon. Mondstadt won't be in any great danger.

Unknown Role (None): What are you doing?
Bruce: I was just having a sleep— Uh... a sweep!
Bruce: ...I was doing a sweep— sweeping survey of all the, uh, safety blind spots in Mondstadt! Mm-hmm!
Bruce: Slacking off? No! By no means, not me! Never! Perish the thought!
Traveler: What a peculiar knight...
Bruce: ...*sigh* Look at me, making a fool of myself.
Bruce: In any case, you can't say peace prevails in Mondstadt unless you've got a freeloading — sorry, I meant free-spirited — knight to show for it...
Bruce: I'm sure my life would have been more interesting if I'd gone with the Adventurers' Guild instead...
Traveler: ...What makes you say that?
Bruce: Just think. As an adventurer, you'd get to go explore wherever you wanted, literally anywhere in the seven nations of Teyvat...
Bruce: And best of all, you can make a living from it! What could be more fun than that?
Traveler: It does sound like a good deal.
Bruce: Exactly! I also feel like the Knights have too serious an air about them for my liking...
Bruce: By comparison, the Adventurers' Guild doesn't have so many annoying rules, and has a lot of interesting people!
Bruce: For example, there's Fischl. I don't always understand everything she says, but it sounds really cool!
Bruce: If only I had joined the Adventurers' Guild back then, I might even be her partner right now...
Bruce: I've even thought of something to call myself. Something like "The Demon King of Damnation." Sounds cool, right?

Unknown Role (None): What are you doing?
Bruce: Hmm! From the look of you, you must be a traveler from out of town!
Bruce: Here you go, try some of this — the crowning jewel of Mondstadt's wine industry, dandelion wine!
Bruce: What? You're underage? In that case... You have to try the apple vinegar!
Traveler: What are you doing here?
Bruce: What do you mean? I'm off work...
Bruce: I sleep better when I've had a little tipple after work to take the edge off.
Bruce: ...Huh? What difference does it make when I slack off all day anyway, you say?
Bruce: Well there's nothing to do because... because Mondstadt is just so peaceful, that's why.
Bruce: I'm sure my life would have been more interesting if I'd gone with the Adventurers' Guild instead...
