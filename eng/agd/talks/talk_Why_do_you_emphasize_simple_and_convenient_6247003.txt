# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Why do you emphasize "simple and convenient"?
Lianfang: Oh... It's a long story...
Lianfang: Chenyu Vale has a leisurely and elegant atmosphere. We locals are used to sitting by the water, brewing a pot of tea with two saucers of beans and two main dishes between us...
Lianfang: We drink, chat, and enjoy the view, and at the height of our enjoyment, we recite and compose poems! Ah, such freedom!
Lianfang: They say a gorgeous view complements delicious food, and in such an environment, the tea in one's cup and the food on one's plate becomes exceptionally intoxicating.
Lianfang: Many traditional dishes in Chenyu Vale were prepared with that in mind.
Lianfang: But at the end of the day, Yilong Wharf is a commercial port, and foreign visitors wouldn't understand even if we told them.
Lianfang: The people coming and going through here are only focused on getting their work done quickly and making a killing, so they need working meals that can be finished quickly.
Lianfang: I've made appropriate improvements to our traditional dishes to satisfy their needs.
Lianfang: Once they fall for our local cuisine, I'll guide them toward calming down and enjoying a proper meal in an appropriate environment...
Lianfang: In this way, we can adapt to the trend of commercialization while promoting our traditional cuisine!
