# Talk Dialog

Traveler: How have things been going for you recently?
Sheikh Zubayr: Well, quite the same as always. I am the resident playwright and manager, and so I am... managing, haha!
Sheikh Zubayr: We are a rather small troupe, so pretty much everyone other than Kourosh wears several hats. I also do some composing, choreography, stage design, and action direction on the side.
Sheikh Zubayr: However, we have had new joiners recently, which has given me some time to focus on something... And of course, one can't complain about the added bustle.
