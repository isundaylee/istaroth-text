# Chronic Illness


## Talk 1

Paimon: *sigh* Paimon was thinking all night about what happened with Collei, and still can't figure out what the problem might be.
Paimon: Maybe she's in a better mood now... Let's go check on her.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hey Tighnari, where exactly are we going to find this plant?
Tighnari: Nilotpala Lotuses can be found all over the rainforest, but it often grows right here around Gandharva Ville.
Paimon: Hmm, given the name, it sounds like we should be looking for it in the water.
Tighnari: You are correct, the Nilotpala Lotus grows in the water. When fully matured, they look like giant blue flowers floating on the water's surface. Quite an attractive species, if you ask me.
Tighnari: The large petals are actually the plant's leaves and sepals which surround a very small flower.
Tighnari: You should note that many of the plants found in Sumeru have names that are contrary to their species.
Tighnari: Take the Kalpalata, for example. The plant is not a lotus at all, but rather a vine. And then there's the Sumeru Rose, which is not a rose, and is completely contrary to its name...
Paimon: Oh, huh... okay then.
Paimon: Note to Paimon: never bring up the topic of flowers with Tighnari.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Alright, we've gathered enough Nilotpala Lotuses. Let's head back to meet Tighnari.

## Talk 4

Tighnari: First, we must locate any branches sustaining the Withering Zone.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Haypasia should still be in the cave. Let's go inside and see how she's doing!

## Talk 6

Tighnari: Hmm, it seems the rumors about you are true then. In that case... Alright, you two may accompany me.
Tighnari: We typically only teach visitors how to identify The Withering as they're about to leave Gandharva Ville. We'll make an exception today and show you what it looks like up close.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Don't sweat it, we've helped others deal with similar situations before.
Tighnari: Wait, you've met other Forest Rangers before? I was planning to properly show you both how to identify The Withering before you left Gandharva Ville.
Tighnari: Anyway, since you two are experienced adventurers, come with me, I'm sure you'll both be able to help.

## Talk 8

Tighnari: Stop, don't move any further. Look there, in the distance.
Paimon: Huh, where? Oh! Look, those plants have withered... That whole area is kinda gloomy. Even the air looks like it's filled with ash.
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon doesn't like the look of this.
Tighnari: That is The Withering.
Tighnari: Alright, Traveler, we're going to have to enter that Withering Zone. Once inside, we'll need to look for what we call Tumors of The Withering. If we eliminate those, then the area will be saved.
Traveler: Gotcha, let's do this.
Tighnari: Thank you. But I must warn you, don't push yourself. This is your first time handling this sort of thing, after all.
Tighnari: Even with elemental powers, once you step inside the Withering Zone, you may experience extreme discomfort. If at any point it becomes too much, return outside the zone and take a breather. It could become a matter of life and death.
Tighnari: You ready, then? Let's go!

## Talk 9

Paimon: Hey, look! That gloomy area over there looks like a Withering Zone.
Paimon: Even though Paimon's seen one before, it's still kinda scary...
Tighnari: Alright Traveler, we're about to enter the Withering Zone. Since you already have experience dealing with these things, you should already know what to do.
Tighnari: But please remember, don't push yourself. If at any point it becomes too much, return outside the zone and take a breather. It could become a matter of life and death.
Tighnari: You ready, then? Let's go!

## Talk 10

Paimon: We did it! Everything's returning to normal now!
Tighnari: Yes, thanks to you two, we were able to quickly restore this area back to normal...
Paimon: Um, Tighnari? You make it sound like we did well, but why does Paimon have the feeling you're worried about something?
Tighnari: It's that obvious, huh? Alright, it's like this...
Tighnari: Recently, the rate at which Withering Zones appear has been increasing. Even though we were able to quickly clear that Withering Zone, it won't be long before another one appears.
Tighnari: If that simply meant more work for me, then that wouldn't be an issue... But it's far more severe than that. The Withering is leaving lasting effects on the rainforest itself.
Tighnari: For instance, even though we cleared out the Withering Zone, many of the plants that were affected will not recover.
Tighnari: This presents a crisis for the ecosystem itself. Many plants in the rainforest are already in decline, directly impacting the wildlife that depends on those plants.
Tighnari: And most disturbingly... as the appearances of Withering Zones have started to increase, Collei's case of Eleazar has also become more serious.
Paimon: Huh? But why's that?
Tighnari: I'm still not sure of the exact reason. However, I've received word from acquaintances at the Akademiya that similar cases are being reported for patients with other conditions.
Traveler: Is there no way to permanently get rid of The Withering?
Tighnari: No, none that we know of. The Withering has been recorded in Sumeru for millennia. It's said that it originates from the depths of the world.
Tighnari: By the way, have you heard of Irminsul before?
Traveler: No, I haven't.
Tighnari: Irminsul is a tree located deep beneath the surface. Although it isn't like any tree we know in a biological sense, you can basically think of it as a large tree that grows downwards rather than upwards.
Tighnari: I'm sure you've heard of Ley Lines, right? They're like the roots of Irminsul, spreading and extending from a massive cavern deep underground all the way up to the surface.
Traveler: (Spreading and extending, a massive cavern... Sounds a lot like what I saw when I lost consciousness in the cave.)
Tighnari: Ley Lines continually absorb the memories of this world, which are then funneled into Irminsul, allowing it to collect knowledge and wisdom from ancient times to present day.
Tighnari: The Dendro Archon is known as the God of Wisdom because her consciousness is directly connected to it. It is also said that the Dendro Archon's power is a manifestation of Irminsul.
Tighnari: And as for The Withering, its emergence is related to a disease that's affecting it.
Traveler: Huh? You mean Irminsul is sick?
Tighnari: That's right. My ancestors learned of this from Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's familiars a long time ago, but even those mysterious creatures did not know of a cure for Irminsul.
Tighnari: I'm afraid we rangers will be battling the Withering Zones here for a long time until a cure is found.
Tighnari: Alright, that's enough on this topic for the time being. Now that we've taken care of things here, it's time for us to head back to Gandharva Ville.
Traveler: I think I've heard it somewhere before.

## Talk 11

Amir: Oh, Tighnari, you all made it back! How did it go?
Tighnari: The Withering Zone you reported has been taken care of. No need to worry.
Tighnari: Huh? Wait, is that...?
Tighnari: Oh no! Haypasia!
Paimon: Huh? What's wrong, Tighnari?
Tighnari: This Dusk Bird is Haypasia's designated courier for urgent news. You do remember her, don't you? She's the scholar you and Paimon were following when you first arrived in Sumeru.
Paimon: Oh, her! How could we forget! Uh, so did something happen?
Tighnari: Let me see what's written in the letter first. Uh...
Paimon: So, what's it say? And what's with that weird expression on your face? Ugh, just let Paimon read it...
Paimon: Huh? Uh, all Paimon sees are three squiggly lines...
Tighnari: *sigh* Yes, allow me to explain. After we brought you from Haypasia's cave to Gandharva Ville, Haypasia resumed her meditation.
Tighnari: She must have just finished. It's been nearly three days since she's had anything to eat, and it appears she's forgotten to prepare some rations. This letter is her asking us for help, we need to go.
Paimon: What? You mean she's been sitting there for three days!? Hey wait, how did you know all that from just a few lines on the paper?
Tighnari: Well, obviously because this has happened before... Last time she drew five lines, and by the time we found her... Ahem, well, I'd prefer not to remember that.
Tighnari: Needless to say, Haypasia's been through worse, but we should still get to her as quickly as possible.
Tighnari: I've got some emergency rations set aside for times like these. Paimon, Traveler, could you two bring these to her?
Paimon: #Wait, you want us to bring her the rations? But will {NICKNAME} be okay if her cave is still filled with that funny incense?
Tighnari: #Let's find out. Here, {NICKNAME}, take a smell and see.
Tighnari: So, how do you feel?
Traveler: Hmm, it's a light and refreshing fragrance.
Paimon: Huh? Really? You're not feeling even a little drowsy?
Paimon: #But wait, how'd you know that {M#he}{F#she}'d be okay this time, Tighnari?
Tighnari: #Back when we were clearing the Withering Zone, I observed that {M#he}{F#she} could adeptly manipulate the Dendro element. I knew then that {M#he}{F#she} would be fine.
Tighnari: #{NICKNAME}, and if I may ask, when I was telling you two about Irminsul's Ley Lines, was what I described similar at all to what you saw when you were unconscious?
Traveler: What I saw weren't hallucinations, were they?
Tighnari: That's correct, those weren't hallucinations at all, though I don't intend to apologize for deceiving you...
Tighnari: Because what you saw is of significant importance, not just for the nation of Sumeru, but the entire world of Teyvat.
Tighnari: My forefathers were shown much favor by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. We took an oath to protect this nation together with her. Now that that duty has fallen to me, it was a part of my responsibilities to ascertain whether you could be entrusted with the fate of Sumeru.
Tighnari: Now, after seeing you in action with my own eyes, you have earned my confidence, and I no longer feel the need to hide any secrets from you.
Traveler: So what exactly was it that I saw?
Tighnari: When you passed out, your consciousness had connected directly with Irminsul. What you witnessed were actually real memories contained within Irminsul itself.
Tighnari: I could try to tell you more, but it would be better if you went to ask Haypasia instead. Her focus on meditation and use of Spirit Borneol are aimed at establishing a connection with Irminsul, just as you did.
Paimon: Uh, that sounds nice and all, but will she really help us? Seriously, she completely ignored us the last time we tried talking to her!
Tighnari: That was because when you ran into her, she was in a special phase of her training. During that time, she must avoid communicating with others.
Tighnari: Please, wait here for a moment.
Black Screen Text: Tighnari leaves for a few moments...
Tighnari: Here, take these. It's a meal I packed for Haypasia, as well as some other ingredients. I'm sure it'll come in handy.
Tighnari: Also, here's a letter that I would like you to give to her. Just show it to her, and she'll answer any questions you may have.
Traveler: Thank you.
Tighnari: No, I should be the one thanking you. You've both been a great help these last few days.
Traveler: No unusual feelings this time.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Tighnari: Anyway, please take good care of Haypasia.
Tighnari: I'll go prepare Collei's medicine now. Using the Nilotpala Lotuses while they're still fresh will significantly boost their effectiveness.
Tighnari: Rest assured, Collei will recover quickly as long as she has her medicine.

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: Shhh! Collei's asleep! Let's come back once she's feeling better.
