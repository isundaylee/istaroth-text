Traveler: How do you like it here?
Sucrose: Oh, uh... Please don't worry about me.
Sucrose: As long as there's a dedicated laboratory, I am more than satisfied.
Sucrose: Your home far exceeds my needs.
Traveler: No need to hold back.
Sucrose: Oh... Um...
Sucrose: I'd feel guilty to trouble you...
Sucrose: But I greatly appreciate your kindness. It means a lot.
Traveler: If there's equipment you need, just say the word.

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Sucrose: Uh... I'm... not very good at making conversation.
Sucrose: Most of my time I spend alone in the laboratory, researching for many hours at a time.
Sucrose: If an experiment doesn't quite go to plan, it can even end up being several days.
Sucrose: I don't know much about what goes on in the outside world... or the kinds of things that people like to talk about...
Sucrose: And, um... I don't really like to go out and socialize much, even on my days off.
Traveler: What about socializing with me?
Sucrose: Oh... If it's with you, then...
Sucrose: No, no... I still don't know what would be appropriate to talk about.
Traveler: You can just talk about whatever comes to mind.
Sucrose: Hmm...
Sucrose: Hearing you say this makes me feel more at ease.
Sucrose: I guess... I can try.
Traveler: It's okay to have nothing particular to talk about, you know...
Traveler: What about chatting with me?

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Sucrose: Oh, actually... I have a few small questions I'd like to ask you.
Sucrose: Just say the first answer that comes to mind. There are no right or wrong answers.
Sucrose: Small Lamp Grass or Windwheel Aster?
Traveler: Small Lamp Grass.
Sucrose: Anemogranum or Anemo Crystalfly?
Traveler: Anemogranum.
Sucrose: A sea of clouds or a field of flowers?
Traveler: Sea of clouds.
Sucrose: Okay, I've noted your responses.
Sucrose: ...Previously, I never really knew how to bring this up.
Sucrose: I thought about inviting you to my private paradise... but currently, I still lack the ability to make it a reality.
Sucrose: So, for now... all I can do is place your selected objects into this crystal ball.
Sucrose: It will keep them safe until the day comes when they can adorn our very own paradise.
Traveler: It's a deal!
Sucrose: ...Alright, it's a deal.
Traveler: You should bring some of your favorite things, too.
Sucrose: Mm-hmm... I'll get there, one day!
Traveler: Field of flowers.
Traveler: Anemo Crystalfly.
Traveler: Windwheel Aster.

Sucrose: A fully-equipped alchemy workshop? And arranged in a rather reasonable manner as well...
Sucrose: Even if an experiment goes, uh, explosively wrong in here, the specimens stored in the storage cabinets shouldn't be damaged...
Sucrose: Huh? Wh—When did you get here? I—I mean... I've been itching to conduct this experiment... I—Is it okay if I go ahead and do it?

## Talk 10

Sucrose: This camp is flawless in every way. It's just a shame that there are no bones lying around...
Sucrose: With a little renovation, perhaps this place could be used for even more valuable research...
Sucrose: Are you interested? Can you... help me?
