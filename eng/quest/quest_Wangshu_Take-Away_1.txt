# Wangshu Take-Away


## Talk 1

Traveler: I'd love to, but I have to get going.
Smiley Yanxiao: Well aren't you a busy one? No problem, I'll get someone else to help me out.

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'll deliver it right now.
Smiley Yanxiao: Well, aren't you straightforward... Well, best hurry, then â€” and <color=#00E1FFFF>be sure not to touch any weird stuff while you're at it</color>.
Smiley Yanxiao: Right, and remember <color=#00E1FFFF>not to use your glider to rush things</color>. If you scatter the meat rolls when you land, the customer isn't taking it.

## Talk 3

Laid Back Ling'guan: Ah, I'm hungry... *sigh* I wonder where my order's gone off too?

## Talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Smiley Yanxiao: What, you here to lend me a hand?
Smiley Yanxiao: Well, you're just in time. Someone named Ling'guan ordered a Matsutake Meat Roll from me.
Smiley Yanxiao: She wanted me to send it to some spot northwest of Dihua Marsh. The Mora's already been paid out, too.
Smiley Yanxiao: Well, if you've got time, how about helping me deliver it? You'll be compensated.
