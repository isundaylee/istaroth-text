Babel: #Oh, {NICKNAME}. Back from exploring, are you?
Traveler: About the traitors...
Babel: You speak of Aderfi and Azariq, yes? Their actions have shamed the Tanit, and before a guest no less...
Babel: They spent too long in contact with those northerners, and forgot that they were children of the Tanit, bound to the rules of the tribe.
Babel: Thankfully, I still have Jeht... She has lived up to my expectations and more.
Traveler: About Jeht...
Babel: Jeht? She is a good child. She learns our ways quickly and greets trouble with neither grimace nor complaints.
Babel: Heh. Speaking of her, it's a shame that there was an... incident between us and her father in years prior...
Babel: But I'm just glad that Jeht has returned to us. Though her father... *sigh* I suppose we can consider this a delayed resolution.
Babel: She likes you, you know. I can tell.
Babel: So... Please don't disappoint her and ruin the friendship you have.
Traveler: About Gurabad and Liloupar...
Babel: So the Mother of the Jinni no longer speaks, for she chose to leave us...
Babel: That truly is... lamentable. Still, she returned to her destiny. Perhaps this might be the best ending she, of us all, could have attained.
Babel: But a Jinni's power will not leave their contracted master. The bottle must contain some vestiges of her power, yes?
Babel: Hehe. The Mother of the Jinn might have departed, but the pact remains. I hope that you can take care of it... and yourself... in the desert.
Traveler: See you.
Babel: Farewell, most esteemed guest. Know that you will always be welcome amongst the Tanit.
