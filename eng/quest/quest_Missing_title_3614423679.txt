## Talk 1

Message Board: This is the message board of Puspa Café. For some reason, I will be the Acting Manager of Puspa Café for the time being. If you have anything that you want to let us know, please feel free to leave a message.

## Talk 2

Message Board: "The legendary story of Antara will continue this week!"
Message Board: "Presented to you by Puspa Café's special resident storyteller, Maddah! Stay tuned!"
Message Board: Mr. Maddah... We'll offer you a cup of coffee free of charge if you stop posting ads here.

## Talk 3

Message Board: "Hehe... Gata, hehehe..."
Message Board: Gata seems to be really fond of you too, Miss Nilou.

## Talk 4

Message Board: "The Puspa Card Club is recruiting members who play Genius Invokation TCG!"
Message Board: "If you'd like to discuss deck setup and techniques, come find me at the card table!"
Message Board: Mr. Nayab, at least order a cup of coffee if you're going to play cards here.

## Talk 5

Message Board: "There have been several cases of Canned Knowledge smuggling recently."
Message Board: "Matra's special reminder: Please go through the authorized procedure when applying for and obtaining the knowledge you seek."
Message Board: "Forbidden knowledge obtained through illegal channels will result in the revoking of your right to study in the Akademiya. Please be aware."

## Talk 6

Message Board: "The atmosphere here is much more friendly than a tavern for a student like me who is preparing for an exam."
Message Board: "There's coffee to keep me going and seniors to seek guidance from."
Message Board: "Even the owner predicted that I'll get in the Akademiya this year!"
Message Board: May your wish come true.

## Talk 7

Message Board: "Be careful, everyone! My friend ran into the Rishboland Raja in the middle of the night in the northwest forest! He was lucky to make it back in one piece. Still, don't go out after sunset!"

## Talk 8

Message Board: "The great researcher Pursina's latest research suggests that drinking coffee improves your cognitive ability."
Message Board: "If you're trying to get in the Akademiya, then visit this coffee shop often."
Message Board: I'm very grateful that you're advertising our shop, but coffee will only give you a little more energy... Besides, the Mahamata might take action against unfounded statements like this, right?

## Talk 9

Message Board: "If you're here to play cards, please learn a lesson from me."
Message Board: "I shouldn't have made up a non-existent card to deceive my fellow players while playing Genius Invokation TCG."
Message Board: "Lord Jackal has helped me realize my mistakes, and I'm here to confess."
Message Board: "Most people can't even realize their mistakes. But... who's this Lord Jackal again?"

## Talk 10

Message Board: "I heard many bandits have been popping up in the desert, and many merchants are refusing to travel the routes there. The price of Ajilenakh Nuts might start to skyrocket."
Message Board: "Awesome! I'm selling all my mushrooms for Ajilenakh Nuts right now! Haha! Perhaps this is the courage and vision of the Alkindi Clan!"
Message Board: I'd love to see your wealth multiply, but I'd like to state that my shop is not responsible for any losses that may arise from the information on this board.

## Talk 11

Message Board: "After retiring from the Corps of Thirty, this is where I get my cup of coffee every day."
Message Board: "The acting manager makes me the same coffee every day, and the storyteller tells the same story."
Message Board: "Perhaps the essence of life in Sumeru lies in repetitions like this."

## Talk 12

Message Board: "The stories Mr. Maddah tell may be old-fashioned, but he's quite skilled when it comes to controlling their pace."
Message Board: "But everyone's used to getting their information from Akasha now, so they unconsciously overlook such sophistication of technique and artistic maturity."
Message Board: "You need to be more realistic. No art form is eternal. The day when all of its value has been exploited is the day it loses its reason for existence."
Message Board: "Like how overripe fruits fall to the earth and provide nourishment for new plants."
Message Board: "And that is exactly why I've always despised materialists like you. Art is a precious fruit of leisure. You can't compare it to production and exploitation for commercial purposes!"
Message Board: "Leisurely people are like people walking on a spherical ground — they don't exist. Why don't you use your brain and think for a moment? Can the production of anything exist without commercial exchange?"
Message Board: "What a sharp clash of theories... Anyway, it's time for Mr. Kaveh to settle his bill for the month. Should it be put on your tab as usual, Mr. Alhaitham?"
Message Board: "No. That spoiled guy needs to experience the brutality of the business world."
Message Board: "Miss Acting Manager, please put it on Lord Sangemah Bay's tab. After all, one can't make art without coffee!"

## Talk 13

Message Board: "After so many years, this place is still so lively! Every time I come to this coffee shop, I can't help but recall that afternoon I spent arguing with him about the interpretation of a single word."
Message Board: Our shop wouldn't be so lively without your patronage. Please do visit often.
