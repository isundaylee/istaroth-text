# Sky-Gazers, Land-Walkers


## Talk 1

Keqing: Let's see... which adeptus shall we visit first?
Paimon: Hmm. Oh, why don't we visit Cloud Retainer at Mt. Aocang first?
Paimon: She usually stays inside her abode, so she'll be super easy to find.
Keqing: Alright, Cloud Retainer it is.

## Talk 2

Keqing: Let's ask Verr Goldet where the Conqueror of Demons may be.
Paimon: Huh? Hold on, isn't that...
Paimon: Qiqi! Oh, and the weird guy with the snake around his neck!

## Talk 3

Keqing: Hmm? Are these footprints?
Keqing: Let's see where they lead.

## Talk 4

Cloud Retainer: The festive season is fast approaching. What brings you to one's abode? Has the Ministry of Civil Affairs simply run out of work for you to do?
Ganyu: Well, with Lantern Rite just around the corner, I decided it was a good time to take leave and pay you a visit.
Ganyu: But, um... where are Moon Carver and Mountain Shaper?
Cloud Retainer: Them? Hmph! Don't even get one started...
Cloud Retainer: Oh? Is that not the Traveler? And the Yuheng too. A rare visitor, indeed.
Paimon: Happy Lantern Rite, everybody!
Traveler: Happy Lantern Rite.
Keqing: Greetings, venerable adeptus. And greetings, Ganyu.
Ganyu: Huh, Lady Keqing? I didn't expect to see you here.
Cloud Retainer: (The Yuheng of the Qixing? Here? Most fascinating...)
Cloud Retainer: Hmm... Most courteous of you to travel hither and pay your respects. What is the purpose of your visit, if one may ask?
Keqing: It's the festive season and on behalf of the Qixing, I'd like to give you our regards. Please accept our humble gifts.
Cloud Retainer: As the governing body of Liyue, the Qixing must be busy with a myriad of affairs. And yet, you still take the time to visit one in this mountain abode. Eminently considerate of you.
Cloud Retainer: Oh? What an amusing cylindrical device. I wonder what that could be...
Keqing: This is a new type of firework which has been modified by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. I've heard that you are fond of gadgets, so I've brought one for your amusement.
Keqing: (Cloud Retainer... although she is not outwardly opposed to us, she is still skeptical of Liyue being ruled by humans.)
Keqing: (Maybe she thinks humans are still too young to handle it. Hmm, no matter, with time, our strength will become apparent enough. Before then, we should try to give her a good impression.)
Keqing: (Hehe... Good thing I came prepared! Cloud Retainer has a great interest in gadgets, so she will certainly appreciate this gift.)
Keqing: (Ganyu has said that Cloud Retainer is very picky about food, so I made sure not to bring any snacks to avoid upsetting her. I've given everything thorough consideration, it should all go well.)
Cloud Retainer: (Goodness me, whoever would have thought... Oh? My, how very interesting.)
Cloud Retainer: It is intricate, with ingenious design... And is aesthetically agreeable...
Ganyu: (Yes, judging from Cloud Retainer's expression, it seems this gift was a success.)
Cloud Retainer: Very good, one shall gladly accept this device.
Cloud Retainer: One surmises from Ganyu's words that you also wish to see Moon Carver and Mountain Shaper. Pity, your timing is most unfortunate.
Paimon: Oh? Are they not home? We wanted to see them, too.
Cloud Retainer: Hmph. Those two old fossils...
Cloud Retainer: Moon Carver has been most anxious to see how Liyue Harbor fares. But the agreement was clear. Liyue is now in the hands of the Qixing, and he cannot simply roam into the city and begin supervising others' work as he pleases.
Cloud Retainer: So, one tried to persuade him otherwise, proposing that if he could not be placated, he could go to the city disguised as a human, and take a brief look around. Alas, he is too stubborn, too proud. He would have none of it.
Cloud Retainer: Thereafter, he left, claiming to have gone traveling. He has not returned since.
Cloud Retainer: Mountain Shaper, however, is more open-minded. But he said he wished to look for something new with which to defend the tranquility of his mountain.
Cloud Retainer: He told one that he was leaving in search of treasures, and one has not heard from him since... Wait! Surely this is not a case of two old coots in cahoots, rusing to excuse themselves that they might venture behind one's back to scurry away and go traveling together!?
Traveler: (Seems possible...)
Shenhe (???): Huh? What's everybody doing here?
Cloud Retainer: This voice... Is it Shenhe?
Keqing: Oh?
Paimon: Oh? So Shenhe's here, too. Is she also here to visit Cloud Retainer?
Ganyu: Is she the one that you mentioned before?
Shenhe: Hello, everyone.
Cloud Retainer: Shenhe, this is Ganyu. You have most likely heard of her.
Ganyu: Oh— Hello, I'm Ganyu. I work at Yujing Terrace. I've heard that you've returned to Liyue Harbor recently, so if you need anything, please feel free to come to me.
Shenhe: I will. Thank you.
Shenhe: I brought some food from the city. I heard that during Lantern Rite, people in Liyue bring food to share with their friends, so here I am.
Keqing: (Oh no! I intentionally refrained from bringing any snacks. Is... Is this going to be okay?)
Cloud Retainer: Oh? And you even brought food for those two old fossils?
Shenhe: That's right.
Cloud Retainer: Hmph...
Keqing: Ahem...
Cloud Retainer: After barely a few days in the city, you have learned so much. Thank you for these delectable edibles, Shenhe.
Keqing: Phew...
Ganyu: Huh?
Cloud Retainer: Everyone, you shall all be staying in Liyue Harbor in the future. One should like to think that you will all look out for each other. Is that understood?
Shenhe: Will do.
Ganyu: Yes, understood.
Keqing: This place is much livelier than I'd imagined...
Traveler: Sounds like it's time we change the topic!
Traveler: Speaking of which, have you seen Xiao?
Cloud Retainer: The Conqueror of Demons? One has not seen him of late.
Paimon: Well, then he's probably not in Jueyun Karst. Let's go look for him in his usual spot at Wangshu Inn.
Cloud Retainer: In short, one is the only adeptus who has elected to remain in Jueyun Karst for the festival.
Cloud Retainer: Had Ganyu not come to visit, one would likely have stayed firmly put in one's abode to resume research of gadgets and mechanics.
Ganyu: I didn't mean to interrupt you. Please accept my profuse apologies.
Cloud Retainer: Haha, why the sudden solemnity? It would certainly not be the first time one has been interrupted on your account.
Cloud Retainer: As a youngling, you did so love to scurry around the place whilst one's attention was monopolized by mechanisms... You were especially drawn to a certain implement one had made. Oh, what was it...?
Paimon: Oh?
Traveler: Huh?
Keqing: (Oh no, here she goes again! This could spell trouble for Ganyu.)
Ganyu: Huh!? Oh—uh, I'm sorry, Cloud Retainer! I—I just remembered there's something I must attend to. I should be going!
Cloud Retainer: Oh? Why the sudden haste? With the Yuheng present, why not settle this matter here and now?
Ganyu: Uh, n—no, it's something very important. In fact, I—I must see Lady Ningguang about it immediately...
Cloud Retainer: A matter so pressing that you must find Ningguang in person?
Keqing: Ahem... Ah, yes, Ningguang and I have different scopes of work, you see, and Ganyu has to report to both of us respectively. It's indeed not easy for her.
Ganyu: (Lady Keqing is trying to help me!)
Ganyu: Yes, that's right! I'm very sorry, everyone. I will take my leave!
Cloud Retainer: Huh, gone already... That child... She has always been easily ruffled.
Cloud Retainer: One can sympathize, however. It is no simple thing to be a secretary. Nearly every matter in Liyue Harbor, momentous or trivial, passes through Ganyu's diligent hands.
Cloud Retainer: But even as an adeptus, she must never neglect her own health, lest she fall prone to exhaustion.
Cloud Retainer: Ganyu is an assiduous worker, apt to foregoing food and rest once she is busy. Please make sure she eats and sleeps properly whenever you see her.
Keqing: I will, Ganyu has always been a great asset to us. Her health is a priority, so I will take good care of her.
Cloud Retainer: The Yuheng, reliable as ever, hehe.
Cloud Retainer: It was indeed a wise decision to leave Liyue Harbor to you.
Keqing: We will certainly strive to live up to your expectations.
Cloud Retainer: As for these edibles... Hmm, they do look delectable indeed.
Cloud Retainer: You may leave them here. Shenhe shall bring these into one's abode, and one shall pass them on to Moon Carver and Mountain Shaper once they have made their return.
Cloud Retainer: This firework has an intriguing design. One must conduct a thorough study of it. And one also wants to hear what Shenhe has learned in Liyue Harbor.
Shenhe: Yes, I have many interesting stories to tell.
Cloud Retainer: Let us chat whilst one scrutinizes this device.
Traveler: You'll continue your research even during Lantern Rite?
Paimon: Yeah, don't you rest during the holidays? This is a festive season, after all!
Cloud Retainer: Hah, one has long been living secluded in the mountains and no longer observes the holidays. Worry not, one shall take appropriate care of oneself.
Cloud Retainer: Rest is crucial. If one is too devoted to one's research and falls ill, one shall be in no fit state to test the devices personally.
Paimon: Is it really that important to test it yourself?
Cloud Retainer: Of course. As one sows, so do they reap, and the joy of reaping is what one yearns for.
Cloud Retainer: If one spends all that time working on a machine, yet forgets to test the outcome...
Cloud Retainer: Hmph, that would be akin to a chef who never tries his own food, no?
Cloud Retainer: It is unwise to put the cart before the horse.
Cloud Retainer: Enough idle chatter, everyone. One must go and continue one's research. Come, Shenhe, this way.
Black Screen Text: Cloud Retainer leaves with Shenhe...
Paimon: A chef who doesn't get to try their own food... Hmm, that would be kinda weird.
Traveler: You sure caught on to that one quickly.
Paimon: Cloud Retainer sure does know a lot about gadgets and cooking! Though she can be a bit strange sometimes... but then again, she is an adeptus!
Keqing: That's the wisdom of an adeptus. She takes good care of those around her. Though she lives in seclusion, she also manages to bring everyone together.
Keqing: A hermit who's more social than most living in society. Hmm, what an interesting character.
Keqing: Traveler, Paimon, let's head to Wangshu Inn. Perhaps we'll find the Conqueror of Demons there.

## Talk 5

Verr Goldet: If you're looking for Xiao, you can check the rooftop terrace upstairs.

## Talk 6

Qiqi: Dr. Baizhu, here are the herbs... I've picked lots of them.
Baizhu: Splendid. Let me pack up and then we can be on our way.
Paimon: Hey you guys! What are you doing?
Qiqi: Dr. Baizhu wanted herbs. So, I came to collect herbs, lots of them. And... Dr. Baizhu came too.
Baizhu: Traveler, Paimon... Oh! And Lady Keqing! It's a pleasure to see you all. We're here stocking up more herbs.
Baizhu: Bubu Pharmacy always runs out of digestive herbs during the festival seasons. With Lantern Rite just around the corner, I thought we should get prepared.
Baizhu: We came all this way to collect some herbs, and we've picked quite the assortment. We'll be on our way back to the pharmacy once the herbs are sorted.
Baizhu: I certainly didn't expect to see the Yuheng all the way out here.
Keqing: I have some business to attend to here.
Baizhu: Ah, I see.
Baizhu: It's nearly time to celebrate Lantern Rite and you're still running errands... hardworking as always!
Keqing: I appreciate the sentiment, Dr. Baizhu. I'm just doing my job.
Qiqi: Keqing and the Traveler are very busy... And we are busy too.
Qiqi: Everyone... keep it up.
Traveler: Yes, keep it up, everyone!
Keqing: Right, thank you, Qiqi.
Keqing: We shouldn't tarry here any longer. Take care, you two... Ahem! Three.
Keqing: Traveler, let's go find Verr Goldet.

## Talk 7

Verr Goldet: Ah, Lady Keqing, what a surprise! Is there anything I can help you with?
Keqing: No, thank you. I'm just wondering if you might know where the Conqueror of Demons is?
Verr Goldet: Oh, we never inquire about Xiao's whereabouts. But if he's here, he would be up on the rooftop terrace. Please feel free to go up and have a look.

## Talk 8

Keqing: Hmm, he doesn't seem to be here. Perhaps we came at the wrong time?
Paimon: Maybe he's out battling somewhere again...
Paimon: Let's leave the gifts with the owner and ask her to...
Xiao: How can I help?
Paimon: Aaaah!!!
Paimon: Wh—Where did you come from? You scared Paimon!
Traveler: Were you here the whole time, Xiao?
Xiao: Yes.
Keqing: Hello, I am Keqing, Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing.
Xiao: The Yuheng... Yes, I saw you when we battled Osial. You are fierce with your blade.
Paimon: Uh anyway, we're here to give you some Lantern Rite presents! See, there's lots of tasty food!
Xiao: Hmph, don't waste your delicacies on me.
Traveler: The Qixing specifically prepared them for you.
Xiao: Hmph...
Xiao: Eradicating demons is my duty. You don't have to thank me.
Xiao: Karma is harmful to humans. Even though your constitution surpasses that of ordinary mortals... It would be best if you didn't approach me so casually.
Paimon: Hey, wait! Are you leaving?
Paimon: C'mon, Lantern Rite is almost here! Don't you want to take a break?
Traveler: Why don't we go watch the fireworks in the city together?
Xiao: Like I said before, I have no liking for crowds.
Xiao: I must remain vigilant of evil attacks, especially during the holidays. I will continue my patrol as usual.
Xiao: You should also exercise caution. And if there's any danger...
Traveler: Yeah, we know.
Xiao: Good.
Paimon: And he's gone...
Paimon: Well, Xiao hasn't changed a bit. Wonder if he'll come and watch the fireworks this year, though.
Traveler: Maybe.
Keqing: Alright, we've completed our visits with all the adepti. Let's take a break downstairs before we head back into the city.
Black Screen Text: After a short break, everyone gathers on the ground floor of the inn.
Pengyi: Oh no! What should we do!?
Pengyi: Huh? Oh, Lady Keqing, Lady Keqing! I'm so glad to see you here!
Keqing: Pengyi? What's wrong? What are you doing here?
Pengyi: Lady Keqing, let me explain...
Pengyi: I had rearranged the fireworks layout and expanded the range to Qingce Village, just like you requested.
Pengyi: My people finished setting up the fireworks and we left someone in charge to launch them for the show.
Pengyi: But... *sigh* the person we left in charge came back shortly after, and reported that all the fireworks in Qingce Village have been stolen!
Pengyi: I immediately reported the situation to the Millelith, and had another batch of fireworks made to be transported to Qingce Village under escort.
Pengyi: However, everyone's short-handed during Lantern Rite. The Millelith are already stretched thin and don't even have enough people to fill their regular patrols. They can't spare anyone to look after the fireworks for us.
Pengyi: We don't have many materials left, so if the second batch of fireworks gets stolen as well, we're done for... So, I was thinking to go to Qingce Village and have a look first.
Pengyi: Which is when I bumped into you. Lady Keqing, what should we do?
Keqing: According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the number of guards on patrol has to be doubled and rotated continuously during Lantern Rite.
Keqing: They must perform these extra measures in addition to their standard daily affairs. The only manpower they can muster during the festival would be the emergency response units.
Keqing: But, those special units are intended only for backup. There are not many of them, and they cannot perform prolonged guard duty. If we wish to make use of them, we'll need to resolve the problem quickly.
Paimon: Hmm, maybe we could ask the adepti for help...
Paimon: This would be a piece of cake for someone like Cloud Retainer or Xiao!
Keqing: *sigh* No, that would only make us look incompetent. I'll handle this, Pengyi.
Traveler: (We can't let Keqing do this all by herself.)
Paimon: We can help too, Keqing!
Keqing: Thanks, you two. Actually, I have an idea. Let me make some arrangements.
Keqing: Pengyi, go back to Liyue Harbor and get the fireworks ready, then meet me in Qingce Village.
Keqing: Traveler, come with me. Let's ask around to see what happened.
Traveler: Yeah, let us help you.
Paimon: That's right, we can take care of this together!
Traveler: Only if he wants to.

## Talk 9

Granny Ruoxin: *sigh* How could a whole batch of fireworks just vanish like that?
Keqing: Hello, Granny Ruoxin. We'd like to know more about the recent fireworks theft.
Granny Ruoxin: Ah, Lady Keqing! I can hardly believe you came personally to investigate.
Keqing: It's no trouble at all. Please, tell us what happened.
Granny Ruoxin: Well, when they brought the fireworks, the children in the village were very excited, they were all gathered around watching the area for a long time.
Granny Ruoxin: The workers piled up the fireworks and said they would go confirm the locations to set them off. That's when they left the village.
Granny Ruoxin: Now let me remember... Ah yes, I recall that they left the fireworks in an open area, just next to a house down the old road.
Granny Ruoxin: But, the very next day, all the fireworks were nowhere to be seen. The person in charge of the fireworks was so anxious that they went straight back to the city to find a solution.
Granny Ruoxin: *sigh* The villagers here are worried too. The fireworks missing can only mean that there are thieves about. There are elderly and kids in the village, you know...
Granny Ruoxin: Although the Millelith are stationed here, no one dares to go out anymore.
Keqing: I understand. Please help reassure the people in the village and tell them everything's going to be fine with the Millelith standing guard.
Keqing: Traveler, let's go investigate the place where the fireworks were stolen.

## Talk 10

Qiqi: Dr. Baizhu, are we done yet?
Baizhu: Yes, almost. But don't rush me, just give me a moment...

## Talk 11

Granny Ruoxin: *sigh* How could such a terrible thing happen during a festival?

## Talk 12

Yanfei: Lady Keqing is so hard-working. Maybe I should take a leaf out of her book...

## Talk 13

Paimon: This is the place... The fireworks were stolen here.
Keqing: The thieves must think there are mostly elderly and children living in Qingce Village, all too weak to defend themselves. Otherwise, they would never dare commit such a blatant crime.
Keqing: This is absolutely awful. We cannot let such a matter go unpunished.
Keqing: Let's see if we can find any clues here before we plan our next step.

## Talk 14

Kangsheng (???): Sir! Please, this is all just a big misunderstanding!
Xingqiu (???): A misunderstanding, you say? If so, then tell me, why are you hiding here?
Kangsheng (???): Please, good sir! This really is just a misunderstanding! I would never dream of getting anywhere near the Feiyun Commerce Guild's shipment!
Keqing: Something's happening over there. Let's go have a look.
Paimon: Oh, the Feiyun Commerce Guild? It must be...
Xingqiu: Please, save your breath.
Xingqiu: Restrain this fellow! Tightly now, we mustn't let him get away.
Hongxing: Yes, young master!
Chongyun: I was sure it was an evil spirit... Turns out it's the Treasure Hoarders again.
Paimon: Xingqiu and Chongyun! Hello!
Traveler: What are you guys doing here?
Xingqiu: Well, hello, dear Traveler! Our fates cross once again. What brings you here?
Keqing: Excuse me, please tell me what is happening here.
Xingqiu: Ah yes, allow me to explain. It so happens that every year during the Lantern Rite, the Feiyun Commerce Guild transports supplies to various villages outside of Liyue Harbor.
Xingqiu: Family rules stipulate that the supplies must be personally escorted by a family member. Because my older brother went last year, the duties have fallen to me this time around.
Paimon: Oh, so what's Chongyun doing here?
Xingqiu: Chongyun happened to be visiting, so I cordially invited him to join us for the journey.
Paimon: Oh, I see. But why did Chongyun say he thought there was an evil spirit?
Xingqiu: I see that you are not familiar with the story of old. It is said that fireworks were once called firecrackers, and were used to ward off evil spirits and the like.
Xingqiu: In ancient times, Liyue was plagued by evil spirits. As people gathered together to celebrate the annual festival, the yang energy would intensify, and evil spirits were thus attracted to the fringes of the city by the strong scent.
Xingqiu: Liyue Harbor was under the gracious protection of Rex Lapis, so the spirits dared not enter the city. However, they still lingered near the city gates and pestered the passersby.
Xingqiu: In order to drive the spirits away, people made firecrackers and lit them near the city gates. The flashes of light and loud noise successfully drove the spirits whence they came.
Xingqiu: This festival is now known as the Lantern Rite. It was my intention to travel around to see if there are any malicious spirits lying in wait for passersby.
Xingqiu: Since I happened to have a shipment of goods to deliver and our course was through the mountains, I naturally thought it best to have my thaumaturge friend traveling alongside me.
Chongyun: Xingqiu said he learned the story about evil spirits from an ancient text.
Chongyun: The text vividly describes the appearance and even the whereabouts of the spirits.
Traveler: (Xingqiu must be leading Chongyun along.)
Xingqiu: Anyway, when we arrived at the area, Chongyun sensed an ambush about to take place.
Xingqiu: Upon searching the area, we found a group of Treasure Hoarders. They tried to flee the moment we were upon them.
Xingqiu: Fortunately, I was swift enough to catch one of them. Your timing couldn't have been more fortunate, we were just preparing to send them to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Xingqiu: He insists the matter is merely a misunderstanding. But things seem quite clear as I see it...
Kangsheng: Good sir, just hear me out! Everyone knows the Feiyun Commerce Guild. Had we known it was your merchant caravan, we never would have dared to attack!
Kangsheng: The master of the Feiyun Commerce Guild is famous for his generosity and noble deeds. A true hero of the people...
Kangsheng: So, you see, this is nothing but a big misunderstanding! W—We didn't want any trouble with the guild!
Keqing: What you mean to say is that you were targeting someone else, then. Well, who was it?
Kangsheng: I... uh, well... Just trust me, we were definitely not trying to steal your goods, please... please believe me!
Keqing: Master Xingqiu, I would like to borrow a few of your staff to escort the thief to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. As for the bounty, we will pay you afterward.
Xingqiu: It is my humble duty to uphold justice. No remuneration shall be necessary.
Xingqiu: Come then, see that this thief to taken to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Hongxing: Yes, young master, leave it to us! You heard him, take this man over there and make sure he is secured. Tie each of his fingers separately if you have to, he's not gonna pull anything under our watch.
Keqing: Wait a second.
Keqing: Please also deliver this message to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Keqing: It's very likely that this thief is related to the recent fireworks theft in Qingce Village. Make sure they have someone question him thoroughly.
Xingqiu: Haha, so the plot thickens.
Xingqiu: Is your task clear? We mustn't disappoint the Yuheng.
Hongxing: Yes, young master, I understand. We'll be on our way!
Black Screen Text: The guards take the Treasure Hoarder away...
Keqing: I've heard many good things about you, Master Xingqiu. Thank you for your assistance.
Xingqiu: I hardly lifted a finger. Think nothing of it.
Chongyun: Everyone, my intuition tells me that there could be more than one group of Treasure Hoarders in this area.
Keqing: More than one group?
Xingqiu: Oh! You've got quite a keen eye, too, Chongyun!
Chongyun: During our search, I found scattered sets of footprints differing from those on the road. There may still be other Treasure Hoarders waiting to ambush passersby.
Chongyun: When I was chasing the Treasure Hoarders earlier, I noticed that they were nearly unarmed and very few in numbers. If they truly intended to ambush the Feiyun Commerce Guild, they must've overestimated themselves.
Chongyun: If you ask me, they didn't seem to be staging an ambush, but rather, it appeared as if they were waiting for someone.
Keqing: It appears they may be the thief's accomplices. They were probably hiding here to wait for the stolen goods.
Xingqiu: What exactly are the stolen goods, if I may ask?
Black Screen Text: Keqing tells them about the fireworks theft in Qingce Village...
Xingqiu: Taking advantage of the elderly and children, what a loathsome group of criminals.
Xingqiu: Lady Keqing, don't fret about manpower. Chongyun, let's go lend them a hand in Qingce Village, shall we?
Chongyun: Yeah, just leave it to us! We can handle a bunch of thieves.
Keqing: Thank you, that will help alleviate the crisis in Qingce Village. Unfortunately, the footprints we were following end here. I don't know where we should go next.
Keqing: It seems we were only a moment away from catching all the Treasure Hoarders...
Paimon: Keqing...
Traveler: Don't worry.
Keqing: Thank you.
Keqing: Master Xingqiu, I'll leave Qingce Village under your watch.
Xingqiu: Most assuredly, Lady Keqing.
Black Screen Text: Chongyun and Xingqiu leave for Qingce Village.
Keqing: Phew, it's fortunate our paths crossed with those two.
Traveler: It's always good to have some help.
Paimon: It's so cool to fight for justice!
Keqing: The thieves who stole the fireworks haven't revealed themselves yet.
Keqing: I'll go have a look around. Traveler, please go take a rest in Qingce Village.
Keqing: I've troubled you enough already. I can handle the rest of this matter myself.
Paimon: Uh, Keqing... Are you planning to look for clues all by yourself? Somehow, that doesn't sound like a very good idea.
Paimon: Oh, wait! You're in the Liyue Qixing! Why don't you ask some of your subordinates to help?
Paimon: At least it'll be safer than investigating on your own.
Traveler: Paimon's right.
Keqing: Yes, I agree, but we are short-handed at the moment. I can handle these trivial matters myself.
Keqing: The fireworks that were transported to Qingce Village were quite bulky. They couldn't have gone far.
Keqing: Way I see it, if they were clever enough, they would conceal the stolen goods somewhere and then come pick them up later.
Keqing: All I have to do is find out where they hid the fireworks, and then return to the location with reinforcements.
Keqing: Don't worry, I am not reckless, and I won't carelessly alert the thieves. You can certainly trust me by now.
Paimon: Well, when you put it that way...
Keqing: It's settled, then. Traveler and Paimon, please go get some rest. I'll go find you in Qingce Village when I'm done.
Traveler: We'll find a way to catch them.
Traveler: (Chongyun never got to see the book, did he?)
