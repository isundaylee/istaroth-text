# Delicious Boudin Noir aux Pommes

A traditional Fontainian dish. A perfect combination, with the sweet fragrance of the apples neutralizing the fat of the blood sausage. An enticing, slightly burnt smell wafts upwards from the plate, and the eyes of those who see it light up as they shout with joy and anticipation.
