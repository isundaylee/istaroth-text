Sosi: Lady Sorush's Yasnapati... Don't give up so easily. You should... try harder.
Traveler: Has something happened?
Sosi: Oh, it's nothing. I'm not making much progress in my research, that's all. This is all part and parcel of a researcher's life.
Traveler: I won't disturb you then.
Sosi: Thank you for your understanding. I'll be continuing with my work then.
