# Talk Dialog

Arbon: Have you heard? Armand's been doing much better recently. He still gets nervous when there are too many people, but he can at least express what he means.
Alberre: Well, he'd better be! How will he become a comedian if he stutters in front of people?
Traveler: Armand?
Arbon: The staff member at Lepaute Horlogerie. You haven't seen him?
Alberre: He's from the same village as us, and he wants to act in comedies. Unfortunately, he has a terrible stutter.
Arbon: They say that it's a long-term effect of him having fallen from the audience seats and hitting his head at a comedy show.
Alberre: I really liked that comedy too. I recall that it was called "Judgment," but nowadays, I feel like I can't really enjoy it.
Arbon: I mean, the kid who wanted to become a comic actor was judged during a comedy called "Judgment"... and his sentence was to never become one.
Alberre: Poor Armand. What sin did he commit, and who was his judge?
Arbon: Who can say?
