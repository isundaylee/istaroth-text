The light turned into...
A seed?
The miracle tree that blesses the people
In this moment new to the world and yet to be known
When to plant it
Where it shall bloom...
She who brings it into being must let her heart and dreams decide
Grant it life
Ei
Is this...
Is it really...
Eternity extends time into infinity
Dreams illuminate each moment within
When both shine in unison
The Sacred Sakura blooms from the darkness
Finally free from the clutches of the Heavenly Principles
Now
The nightmare has dissipated
And reality is made whole
The vision we both yearn for is still further ahead
My only regret
Is that I cannot witness Inazuma's future
Nor can I walk this journey with you
Do you know
Ei
I am so happy right now
Because my final wish has now come true
Your polearm once protected me from countless calamities
For this
I've always felt indebted to you
Though I could never repay you in full
This Sacred Sakura will buy you some time
Until you are ready to awaken
And embrace the new
What do you think?
Did it do the trick?
This time
It really is goodbye
Ei
Goodbye
Makoto
