# Stolen, by the Rightful Owner


## Talk 1

Traveler: Dragonspine doesn't have a lava lake.

## Talk 2

Taliesin: *sigh* This doesn't make sense. How weird.
Taliesin: It should be around here... But why can't I find it?
Traveler: What happened?
Taliesin: My ring... It's gone. It means a lot to me. I must find it...
Traveler: What does it look like?
Taliesin: It's made of brass and is inlaid with a beautiful red gem...
Taliesin: I found it by a lava lake where the shadow dragon Durin fell in the legends. Or at least, this should explain why its luster resembles dark flames...
Paimon: Whoa...
Taliesin: It is said that the Lord of the Abyss will fix its malefic gaze upon the ring bearer and send an army of darkness to hunt them down.
Paimon: Oh!

## Talk 3

Taliesin: You're back. Did you find it?
Traveler: Take a look. Is this your ring?

## Talk 4

Taliesin: Yes, it is! Thank you so much!
Taliesin: Please take these as your reward. It isn't much, but please don't feel offended. I'll compose verses to eulogize your deeds!

## Talk 5

Traveler: I don't believe this story.

## Talk 6

Taliesin: Ahem... My bad. As a poet, I have a propensity for dramatic language and novel tales.
Taliesin: Hehe, truth be told, I found the ring in a Weasel Thieves' nest... It was well-preserved and eye-pleasing, so I kept it.
Paimon: Hmph, so you're a thief too, you just stole from thieves!
Taliesin: Don't say that... I chanced upon it! That's right, it was chance! And though chance it be, the ring is quite precious to me all the same.
Traveler: Do you have any clue concerning the ring's whereabouts?
Taliesin: Yeah... I've heard that Weasel Thieves are often spotted around here. They might've stolen my ring while I was sleeping.
Paimon: Huh, so there really are people who take their rings off before going to bed...
Traveler: I'd never heard of such people before, either.
Paimon: Anyway, Paimon doesn't have that habit! You need to think about where to put the ring once you take it off, or you'll be wasting good beauty sleep.
Traveler: Do they even make rings tiny enough for you, Paimon?
Paimon: Hmph, of course they do! There's much you still don't know!
Taliesin: Enough. Please refrain from judging other people's way of living before proceeding to ramble on about your own! It's very rude!
Taliesin: ...Anyway, if you want to help out... Please keep an eye out for Weasel Thief nests.
Taliesin: I've heard that there is a camp of suspicious Treasure Hoarders around here on the map... I've marked the location out for you.
Taliesin: It's said that Weasel Thieves are often spotted around here. Those sneaky Treasure Hoarders probably have something to do with them... Anyway, please take a look there.
Paimon: Hmph... A ring stolen from the Weasel Thieves, which was then stolen again by other Weasel Thieves. Paimon'd say it has gone back to its rightful owner!
Taliesin: Oh, come on, just stop it already!

## Talk 7

Weasel Thief Training Manual: "...About the feeding schedule for Weasel Thieves..."
Weasel Thief Training Manual: "...Amateur Weasel Thief: Feed after noon to keep their excessive energy in check... Recommended Time: *12:00–23:59*"
Weasel Thief Training Manual: "...Hoarder Weasel Thief: Feed before noon to allow a more flexible training schedule... Recommended Time: *2:00–11:59*"
Weasel Thief Training Manual: "...Golden Weasel Thief: The most cunning of all. Limit its feeding and interacting window within two hours... Recommended Time: *0:00–1:59*"
Weasel Thief Training Manual: "All Weasel Thieves listed above can be summoned during their respective feeding hours. Stand on a large rock and summon them by whistling. Avoid whistling for fun, as it may lead to unnecessary trouble!"
Weasel Thief Training Manual: "...By Erge. Weasel Thief Trainer on Duty This Month: Clitopho... Scheduled Days: 31 (Late: 27)..."
Paimon: Whoa! Don't the Treasure Hoarders ever take breaks?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Clitopho: Hey there, has something happened recently?
Traveler: About Weasel Thieves...
Clitopho: Oh, you mean the ones in The Chasm... I was assigned to take care of them, but I messed up, so there's really nothing much to say.
Clitopho: Eh... It's impossible for me to capture them again. They are, after all, masters of hide-and-seek. It's so hard to track them down.
Clitopho: But I can help you a bit if these annoying creatures happen to have stolen things from people.
Clitopho: Weasel Thieves trained by Treasure Hoarders are fed at fixed hours in a day. There are three types of Weasel Thieves...
Clitopho: The Golden Weasel Thief is the most cunning one... Then, there's the more common Hoarder Weasel Thief. The dumbest of all is the Amateur Weasel Thief. Well, as for when they show up...
Clitopho: *sigh* There should be a training manual somewhere with the feeding timetable on it, as no one really bothered to remember the exact time. The manual should be in the camp frequented by Weasel Thieves.
Clitopho: Ah... I almost forgot this! Give a whistle if you want to summon them.
Traveler: Give a whistle?
Clitopho: Yep, just any old whistle will do. It's not some complicated trick. The key is the timing.
