Ruta: Mt. Yougou, was it? Ugh, it sure looks quite high from here...

## Talk

Traveler: The mountain paths are tough to tread.
Ruta: I agree. Now, if I was swimming it would be easy, no matter how far, but these steep mountain slopes...
Ruta: Though I've heard the locals say there are shrine maidens on Mt. Yougou. Shrine maidens are known to be skilled diviners, and that's all the incentive I need for the climb.
Ruta: I'm hoping for "Great Fortune"! I'm not quite sure what it represents, but I hear it's the best result possible.
Ruta: My luck's always been good. As long as I can make it up this mountain, I know there'll be great news waiting for me at the top!

Traveler: You'll be up there in a flash.
Ruta: Really? Just like those friends from the Scions of the Canopy? Do you think I can climb like them?
Ruta: Hmm... I guess there's only one way to find out...
Ruta: Tell you what, I think I've got it. I'll explore the area a little first, then make my way up Mt. Yougou one step at a time!
Ruta: Oh, I almost forgot. I saw someone carrying a puppet just now. It was styled like a captivating young woman holding a sword â€” and it was so beautiful, too! I must find out where I can buy one...

Traveler: I wish you the best of luck.
Ruta: Thank you! One can never have too much luck!
