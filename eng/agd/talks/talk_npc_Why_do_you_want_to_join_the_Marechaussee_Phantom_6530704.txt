Traveler: Why do you want to join the Marechaussee Phantom?
Virda: Because I want to defend justice as one of their members — and also, their official uniform is super cool.
Virda: Oh yes — my favorite character in "Great Detective Hurlock" is Agent Gina of the Marechaussee Phantom.
Virda: Although her deductions are often full of holes, the effort she puts in to catch criminals for the sake of her future is very inspiring indeed!
Virda: So yes, I dream of becoming a member of the Marechaussee Phantom!
