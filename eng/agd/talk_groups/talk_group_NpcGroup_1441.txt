Guy: Another meaningless day...
Guy: Oh! Do you need a hand with anything? B—But never mind if you don't though!
Traveler: What are you doing?
Guy: I'd like to know as well... What are you doing here, Guy?
Guy: Alright, I'm guarding the side gate of Mondstadt. As everyone knows, it's a gate that no one uses.
Guy: Mock me all you want. I know it's a pointless job.
Traveler: You seem upset.
Guy: Of course I'm upset.
Guy: I've started training at the age of 8, learned swordsmanship at the age of 10, and become a squire at 16...
Guy: I'm the pride of the family, yet I'm tasked with such a job...
Guy: As a member of the Knights of Favonius, guarding the side gate is like Cat's Tail without Diona. There's no soul in it!
Guy: ...Anyway, have you bumped into any trouble? Any kind at all — let me see if I can help! I am a Knight of Favonius after all!
Guy: Oh... Okay then...
Traveler: Goodbye.
Guy: Please do come to me when you need help...
Guy: Well, forget it. You won't remember me anyway...
