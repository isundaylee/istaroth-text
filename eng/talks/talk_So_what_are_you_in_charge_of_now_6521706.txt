Traveler: So what are you in charge of now?
Vuillermoz: Me? Nothing. Mr. Raimondo asked me to help supervise the reconstruction work, but... Well, I'm completely clueless about that kind of thing.
Vuillermoz: And when Mr. Raimondo realizes how useless I am he's bound to fire me.
Vuillermoz: *sigh* Maybe I should just quit and go and find a more suitable job...
