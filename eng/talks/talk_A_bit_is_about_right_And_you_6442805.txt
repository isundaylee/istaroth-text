Traveler: A bit is about right. And you?
Rahman: Hah, well, I've actually gotten busier recently. Other than completing the work that Cyno has assigned to us, I still have my lady's protection to worry about.
Rahman: By "my lady," I mean Ms. Setaria, whom I'm sure you know. She left the Akademiya recently â€” with permission, of course.
Rahman: She wants to pass on the things she knows to the desert people. Both Lesser Lord Kusanali and Cyno have approved of this plan, and they've both helped quite a bit, too.
Rahman: Ah, this is a blessing that is hard to come by, especially for us, the children of King Deshret. We must hold it most dear indeed.
