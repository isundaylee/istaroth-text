Message: "I discovered that there's a Melusine who sits there every day, sighing. Has she run into some kind of trouble?"
Another Person's Message: "Are you talking about Menthe? She's always saying something like 'The Iudex is above' or whatever, she must have run into some kind of intractable problem."
Owner's Message: "Menthe works for the Maison Gardiennage. She can only have become so depressed because of encountering so much unfathomable darkness in the course of her work. I truly feel sorry for her."
