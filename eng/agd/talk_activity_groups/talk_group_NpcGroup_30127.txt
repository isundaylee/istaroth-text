Keqing: What did you think of this year's fireworks display?
Keqing: I just hope this festival can be everything that people want it to be.
Traveler: They were lovely.
Keqing: Really? I hope you're not just saying that to reassure me. I want you to be straight with me if you have any suggestions.
Keqing: Anyway... If you have any time during the festival, take a look around the city. There's a lot to see, but it won't last. So make the most of it.
Keqing: If only I had a little more free time... I'd love to take you around and show you everything we did to make the city look special during the festival.
Traveler: I liked them a lot.
