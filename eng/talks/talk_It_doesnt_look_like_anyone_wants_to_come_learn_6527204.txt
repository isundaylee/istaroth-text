Traveler: It doesn't look like anyone wants to come learn.
Millereau: I'm surprised you saw our dilemma so quickly...
Millereau: It's true â€” the Mutual Aid Network is a small group. Few people are interested in us, let alone want to join us.
Millereau: But I still believe that my work is meaningful.
Millereau: When I first arrived in the Fortress of Meropide, I was completely lost. I passed each day in a daze, not daring to think about anything to do with the future.
Millereau: It was only after I joined the Mutual Aid Network that I gradually began to realize that in this world, there are many "things that I can still do."
Millereau: Even if it's just a few, insignificant little things, I can still get a sense of fulfillment from doing them...
Millereau: I hope I can introduce this mindset to more people. I want to help others completely transform themselves, and once more stand upright beneath the light.
