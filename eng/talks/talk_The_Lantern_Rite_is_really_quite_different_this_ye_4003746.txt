Changshun: The Lantern Rite is really quite different this year...
Changshun: I'd heard that the Ministry of Civil Affairs was organizing a fireworks show, so I started pooling resources to make those fireworks through various channels.
Changshun: Then halfway through, the news that Lady Ningguang was rebuilding the Jade Chamber broke, and the remuneration was so tempting that I changed tacks...
Changshun: In the end, I failed to accomplish either project... I suppose there really is no room for indecisive dawdling in business.
Changshun: But although I didn't manage to seize this opportunity, I did still manage to prepare some material for Xiao Lanterns. Not for selling â€” just for sending them to my neighbors and friends.
Changshun: I hope that everyone will enjoy this year's Lantern Rite.
