# Peseng's Zaytun Peaches


## Talk 1

Peseng: Hmm... Which shop sells Zaytun Peaches? I can't remember...
Traveler: About the Zaytun Peaches...
Peseng: Yes! My wife needs Zaytun Peaches for cooking meals. Ten peaches will do for a couple of days.
Peseng: Do you have ten Zaytun Peaches?
Traveler: Here are the Zaytun Peaches you wanted.
Traveler: Not yet.
Peseng: Too little peaches won't be enough, and I'll get scolded for that... Come back to me when you've collected enough of them.

## Talk 2

Peseng: These will do. I hope she'll feel better after seeing these, at least for the rest of the day.
