Traveler: What sort of collaboration?
Hoa: They actually come up quite a lot. Let me think...
Hoa: Sometimes, adventurers would want to hire a guide from the People of the Springs, or request a doctor from the Masters of the Night-Wind. If they don't know how to find such individuals themselves, they'll often ask me to pass on the word.
Hoa: Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. It's only right that we help each other out.
Hoa: Y'know, like when we were struggling with the Abyss. I was running here and there delivering an endless torrent of messages and letters, and after it was all over, I had to take a much-needed rest.
Hoa: But thanks to our brave heroes, I guess we won't ever have to face another war like that.
