### Additional Talk 1

Kaeya: You don't plan on taking the shell back with you, Miss Sangonomiya?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: No, I think it's better if it stays here with Idyia.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Watatsumi Island has something new to treasure now, and slowly but surely, people are seeing progress in pursuing their aspirations.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It'll be of more use here, where it can protect this bottle domain, and the dreams of all who journey through here.

### Additional Talk 2

Collei: ...If we start at Aaru Village and take a slight detour, we'll be able to see Caravan Ribat and Pardis Dhyai on the way to Sumeru City...
Eula: Ah, very good...
Lessig: Planning to do any souvenir shopping along the way? You can just focus on buying the gifts, I'll carry the bags!
Lessig: Don't worry about the weight, I can handle it! As long as it's nothing too gigantic, I'll fit it in the bag!
Eula: Calm down, how many people do you think we'll be buying for...?
Klee: Mom, Albedo, Master Jean, Razor... Ooh, and Diona, and Mona, and Fischl...
Eula: Hmph, what's that look for?
Collei: Nothing, nothing...
Collei: So, Klee, what are you planning to buy for everyone?
Klee: Ummm... Sunsettia-flavor candies! And big Fungi caps! And, and...
Klee: ...And loads and loads of storybooks for everyone!
Klee: But I haven't decided what to get for Mom yet...
Eula: There's no rush. Let's see what they've got, and if you're still unsure, we can help you decide.
Klee: Yay! Thanks, you two!
