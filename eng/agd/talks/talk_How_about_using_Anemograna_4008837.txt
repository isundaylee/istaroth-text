Traveler: How about using Anemograna?
Paimon: You mean blowing the goods dry with the strong wind from the Anemograna?
Paimon: Hmm... The wind will be strong enough for sure, but won't it blow the goods away?
Paimon: Perhaps we can tie the boxes together and increase their total weight that way!
Mats: Huh. That's not a bad idea! I'll send someone to find Anemograna right now, and I'll send all the supplies over.
Mats: Thank you both very much. Please accept this as a token of my gratitude.
