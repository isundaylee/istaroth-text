# Warrior's Spear

One of the six lost offerings scattered throughout The Chasm. It was lost amid the ancient battlefield five hundred years ago. The long years have worn the edge of the spear-point away, but it still looks quite ominous nonetheless.
One can imagine that it was once wielded by a warrior most brave, earning the cheers of the young wherever it swept, even unto The Chasm itself.
