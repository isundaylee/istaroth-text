Traveler: How do you like it here?
Layla: Oh, don't worry, I've got everything I need here, no complaints at all.
Layla: Usually, I'm pretty picky about whether the place has any pesky bugs flying around...
Layla: You know, the kind that keep buzzing around the room and distracting you.
Traveler: Oh, you mean Cicins?
Layla: Yeah! Those are the ones!
Layla: They may be tiny, but when they go buzzing right by your ear in the dead of the night... BZZT! Ugh, it's so annoying.
Layla: I used to always lose sleep because of those pests, but thankfully there's nothing like that here.
Layla: It's tidy and peaceful here. Practically an oasis for insomniacs like me!
Traveler: You mean Fireflies?
Layla: No, not those... Oh, c'mon, I'm not an entomology major and even I know that Fireflies aren't anything like what I'm talking about.
