Golden Dusk Announcement: "Our restaurant has been a bit shorthanded lately, so we're hiring another host or hostess to help out! No special requirements, just passion for the job and a sunny disposition."
Golden Dusk Announcement: "If possible, we'd prefer it if you knew a little bit about medicine. After all, tourists sometimes find that the food doesn't agree with them or get upset stomachs, so they might need us to take care of them a bit."
Golden Dusk Announcement: "Anyway, if you're interested, just leave a message or just go straight to Kupo Nui. No need for appointments, the doors of the Golden Dusk are always open to you!"
Small Print: "Also, hosts and hostesses should enjoy cold drinks too!"
