# Talk Dialog

Diona: Wow, I can't believe I'm holding the key to shaking up Mondstadt's entire wine industry in my own two hands... Wowzaa!
Diona: #Thank you so much, Traveler! I'm gonna head back and start developing my new drinks right away!
Venti: Wait, don't leave without me! I thought you were gonna let me be the taste tester!
Diona: Of course, hehe... Operation "eliminate drunkards" has just begun, and you, my friend, are my first test subject...
Venti: #And just like that, another problem solved! Looks like you've done it again, Traveler and Paimon.
Diona: Alcohol that doesn't make you drunk... If I'm able to develop something like that... I guess there really is a type of alcohol that I can get behind...
