Wizard Moneybags: Not decisive, nor sharp, nor quick, nor experienced... There's still room for improvement.
Traveler: Wanna try again?
Wizard Moneybags: A rematch, is it?
Wizard Moneybags: Hmm... Yes, this seems worth the effort. Let us begin, then!
Traveler: About Grandmaster Hanakado...
Wizard Moneybags: My benefactor? Sorry, I don't know much about him either.
Wizard Moneybags: I only know that he has a keen eye for Onikabuto.
Wizard Moneybags: When no one else was interested in my Onikabuto Magic Show Troupe, he was the only one who kept coming to my shows. He even memorized the name of every single Onikabuto.
Wizard Moneybags: Though the Mora he gave me was only enough for me to buy two bowls of Unagi Chazuke, he is my biggest and only supporter. I'd help him for free!
Paimon: Oh... So you used to actually train Onikabuto to put on shows? No wonder you used so many fancy words just now...
Paimon: Well, we'll go watch your Onikabuto show once we finish the beetle brawl!
Wizard Moneybags: Haha... I've been barely able to make ends meet for years, so I'm looking for another way out.
Wizard Moneybags: If we are fated, you may hear the name "Wizard Moneybags" again years from now.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Wizard Moneybags: Well, see you later. I need to really think about how I can improve...
