Traveler: Color, you say?
Acat: Of course. You're not in the wrong place, are you? We sell paints in this shop, not colorful drinks.
Acat: If you bring me a sample, I can mix you a paint of the exact same color.
Acat: Or to err on the side of caution, perhaps I should say... I can mix a color that's ninety-nine percent the same.
