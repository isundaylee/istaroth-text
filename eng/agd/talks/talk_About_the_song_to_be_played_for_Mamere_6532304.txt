Traveler: About the song to be played for Mamere...
Topyas: Oh! I finally played it for her as a farewell gift when she left the village to travel!
Topyas: She said she could see tall towers and gorgeous ships as it played in her ear...
Topyas: And she even mentioned the probability of creating a masterpiece based on it! She never ceases to impress!
Topyas: Anyway, I owe you my thanks! I couldn't have made such a precious memory without your help!
