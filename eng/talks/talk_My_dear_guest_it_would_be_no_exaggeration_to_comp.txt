Linlang: My dear guest, it would be no exaggeration to compare your performance to an adeptal hymn.
Linlang: When I was just starting in this line of work, I went to Minlin to purchase some ancient jade. On the way there, I heard music coming from Qingyun Peak.
Linlang: I was so enraptured that I wondered if it might be the music of the adepti themselves, you know? Haha. Thank you — I thought I'd never get the opportunity to hear it again.
Linlang: As for the music festival, I must say that I wouldn't call myself any kind of music enthusiast — I simply happen to like this tune. So forgive me if I must decline.
Linlang: But allow me to let slip from my lips this tidbit of gossip: I believe Mingxing Jewelry's boss, Xingxi, is a closet fan of music. Perhaps you could ask her?
Linlang: Last but not least, I wish you the best of luck with your festival.
