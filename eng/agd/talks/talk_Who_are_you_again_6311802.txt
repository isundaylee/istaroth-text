Traveler: Who are you, again?
Miyazaki Saburou: I am a swordsmith from Tatarasuna and a successor of the Miyazaki Art.
Miyazaki Saburou: I have been under the protection of the Sangonomiya troops ever since the war broke out. Therefore, I decided to join them and offer them support in terms of weapons and equipment.
Miyazaki Saburou: If you want to ask about the forging secrets of the Miyazaki Art, I'm afraid that I can't tell you. But if you want to learn about the history around here on the other hand, I have some tales to tell.
Miyazaki Saburou: I have been around for long enough, after all, to know a little more than others. Hahaha.
