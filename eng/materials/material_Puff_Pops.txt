# Puff Pops

A snack with lots of different flavors. If you close your eyes, you won't be able to guess what flavor you'll get next, and eating them is sure to increase your heart rate â€” and that's what makes this popular amongst the Scions of the Canopy. By the way, the "pop" part of the name comes from the sound of Grainfruit kernels bursting open under high temperatures.
