Traveler: Good morning, Tighnari.
Tighnari: Morning. The day's plans are best made at dawn. The early bird catches the worm.
Tighnari: Early-rising worms might object to this, of course, but that's just how the food chain works.
Tighnari: See, no matter how early they rise, a tree's leaves will still get eaten by insects. You don't hear them complaining, do you?
