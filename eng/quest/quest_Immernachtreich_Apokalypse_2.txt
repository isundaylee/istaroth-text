# Immernachtreich Apokalypse


## Talk 1

Paimon: That sounds like a happy ending to Paimon!

## Talk 2

Narrator: "She picked up mere stones to carve out mountains and oceans, before bestowing upon her people castles and towns."
Narrator: "My magnificent kingdom is a small and forbidden paradise."

## Talk 3

Narrator: "When the people worshiped her, she replied, 'Celebrate me by staging a play in the wilderness.'"
Narrator: "'Bow down to me, and bring me beautiful dreams in return for everlasting glory within the eternal darkness.'"

## Talk 4

Leon: Aah! Help me!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Paimon had a feeling he'd show up... again!
Leon: Please don't say that. I can assure you that this will definitely be the last time!

## Talk 6

Paimon: There's the book! Let's go and close it.
Paimon: Let's hope we won't get transported to another strange place this time...

## Talk 7

Kaedehara Kazuha: Take it one step at a time and don't rush. You can win as long as you maintain a level head.

## Talk 8

Xinyan: Fella, if you want to survive and thrive, you should be more careful next time.
Kaedehara Kazuha: A successful journey requires perseverance, courage, as well as a keen sense of danger. You have the first two, but in the future, please strive to be more vigilant.
Leon: I shall remember your words for the rest of my life. But it is time to say our final goodbye.
Leon: You may not have noticed, but the weather has improved, and the sea has become pleasant and calm... We have awaited this day for a long time.
Leon: You may be amazed that someone as reckless as me could become an actor, but please believe me when I say it's not by chance.
Leon: Every Nachtraben is looking for a way to contribute to the world. We just want to find our place, our destiny. We were born to seek the roles that fate has assigned us to play.
Leon: You may not be aware that "Hymn of the Holy Land" is also a book of prophecies.
Paimon: Prophecy? But Paimon thought it was a sacred scripture?
Leon: Yes, it is. Hundreds of years ago, the Immernachtreich was engulfed by a menacing shadow, but our ruler stood by and did nothing, as if she had lost interest in ruling the kingdom.
Leon: Soon after, Oz, the Great Sekretär, appeared among us. He brought us the sacred scriptures, and a most encouraging prophecy.
Leon: That prophecy is just as it's described in the book, and predicts a blessed future for the Immernachtreich. As a result, we became convinced that the gloomy skies would eventually clear, and we have been eagerly waiting for that blessed day.
Leon: The Soteria... the Prinzessin der Verurteilung. She will eventually remember the paradise of the Immernachtreich, and on that day, we will devote to her the plays that were promised in the prophecy.
Leon: That is why I have stepped forward to take on the role of a warrior. I'd do whatever it takes to prove my devotion to her.
Fischl: ...
Leon: Y—Your Highness?!
Paimon: Oh, right, yeah she was lurking in the back when we rescued you for some reason...
Fischl: My citizen, thy will is strong enough to sunder the wicked dragon's wings. I shall now receive thy blessing.
Leon: It is my utmost honor!
Fischl: Thou hast done well. 'Tis also most evident that thou dost possess the virtues of a knight. Go, take thy position, and wait for the performance to begin.
Oz: We commend your unfaltering loyalty to Her Highness. Her Highness will now lead her retainers into battle against the shadow that plagues the Immernachtreich.
Leon: ...Thank you, Your Highness, and thank you, everyone. In that case, I will take my leave!
Leon: Oh, by the way, please keep in mind that the password for the gate ahead is "Sieh an, mein Sommernachtgarten!"
Paimon: Paimon's confused. What were you guys role-playing just now?
Fischl: Is there not a single one of my lords and ladies who understood my precepts? Fools.
Oz: What mein Fräulein means to say is that you are all rather stupid.
Mona: Yeah, you didn't need to translate that!
Kaedehara Kazuha: I suppose this is the important business Her Highness warned us about earlier.
Xinyan: Let's get this over with!
Paimon: Huh? Wait! What is it? What's happening?

## Talk 9

Narrator: "...spoke amid a downpour of the dragon's blood. She said, 'May my people be freed from the shackles of ancient decrees.'"
Oz: Such wise and compassionate words could only come from your own writing, mein Fräulein.
Fischl: Hmph, yet this kingdom appears to be anything but what I've described. The shadows lurking behind the scenes are disconcerting...
Narrator: "Prinzessin Fischl again continued her song, and the interwoven chords of her sacred words became the Immernachtreich's hymn."

## Talk 10

Mona: Library? Why are we inside a library?
Fischl: ...
Fischl: You must be the arch-nemesis I've been looking for, the useless and cowardly so-called Prinzessin?
Immernacht Fischl: Hmph, how laughable. What gives you the impression that you can defeat me? You should know, over the past few days... I've seen all of your fear and trepidation.
Paimon: Why is there another you? Is it a shadow?
Immernacht Fischl: Shadow? Yes... I suppose that probably describes our connection aptly enough. So, have you come to surrender to me, little Amy?
Fischl: Ugh... you...
Immernacht Fischl: And that raven over there... You must be Oz? Excellent. I have been waiting for you for a long time.
Immernacht Fischl: I heard that a great sekretär named Oz brought the "Hymn of the Holy Land" into Immernachtreich. I suppose that was you.
Oz: ...At your service, mein Fräulein.
Xinyan: Why did you call her mein Fräulein?
Oz: As you can see, that's also mein Fräulein over there. And if she is mein Fräulein, then does that not make her my master?
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...Seems logical enough.
Immernacht Fischl: I might as well inform you that the Immernachtreich is a place with no way out. Now that you've made it here, I shall crush you and make you my servant.
Immernacht Fischl: As for Oz, despite bringing over that hideous Book of Prophecies, and causing the foolish citizens to fall to their knees worshiping that piece of nonsense...
Immernacht Fischl: Why don't you come over to my side? After all, "Fischl is destined to team up with Oz."
Oz: Mein Fräulein flatters me. I see no reason to refuse.
Fischl: Oz!? Where do you think you are going!?
Mona: He's actually going over to the other side... Fischl, haven't you taught your raven anything about loyalty?
Fischl: Gah! This is not the time to discuss my shortcomings!
Fischl: Have you been bewitched, Oz? Why should you trust that she's telling the truth? Is not the Immernachtreich a sacred land of liberty and theater?
Immernacht Fischl: You are gravely mistaken if you presume the Immernachtreich to be some kind of amusement park.
Immernacht Fischl: Listen closely... it is a tomb for those who cannot face reality. You will be buried here, and I will take Oz, the product of our imagination, and live forever in the royal castle.
Fischl: ...A tomb...?
Immernacht Fischl: You of all people should know about this. Why does it always rain in the Immernachtreich? Why isn't there any music in this so-called paradise?
Fischl: ...Because of you! It's all because of you!
Immernacht Fischl: How pathetic! No, dearest Amy, you, not I, are the one responsible for all of this!
Fischl: Ugh...!
Immernacht Fischl: You dreamed up a vast kingdom, but you can't bear its weight. Swayed by fear, you can't face the very world you've created. You may try to avoid it, but the fact is: You can't change yourself.
Immernacht Fischl: I came here in your stead precisely because you failed to show up. The Immernachtreich is now mine, and it is not your place to tell me what to do!
Fischl: I... I...
Immernacht Fischl: Amy, you are but a weak fool who does not deserve this world. Begone.
Xinyan: Hey, are you done?
Mona: For you to give yourself such a piece of your mind, it must have been bothering you for a long time.
Fischl: Mona... *sobs*
Mona: Oh? What's that look on your face?
Fischl: I... I...
Mona: Hmph. You're not going to admit defeat, are you?
Fischl: ...I hate to admit it, but... she might be right...
Kaedehara Kazuha: No, Please do not think that. Your Highness, do you still remember why we came here?
Fischl: Kazuha...
Kaedehara Kazuha: I am a samurai from Inazuma who's been entrusted with your safety. These individuals also responded to your call.
Xinyan: Having your own tomb does sound pretty cool, but the Immernachtreich is not a tomb.
Fischl: Xinyan...
Immernacht Fischl: ...Oh, so you've made some friends. But do you really think that's enough for you to defeat me?
Immernacht Fischl: I am your fear, your dark side. I am the nightmare from which you have never escaped in all these years. Standing before me, you are nothing.
Fischl: ...
Fischl: ...
Fischl: ...No. I can't... I... I can't lose. Not now.
Fischl: I will be the one to claim victory! Just you wait, I will make you regret everything you said!

## Talk 11

Immernacht Fischl: Impossible! How did you make it through that nightmarish library... Stand down!
Fischl: ...Do you still think I'm going to lose?
Immernacht Fischl: You...!
Fischl: You looked down on me. You thought I was a worthless coward.
Fischl: And yes, I did use to be like that, because... I am someone who can't face reality, who spends all day daydreaming, and can't cope with setbacks or criticisms.
Fischl: But now I understand. I understood as soon as I first laid my eyes on this mirage.
Fischl: Do you see that incredible world out there? So vast, so breathtaking... that is my imagination, the source of my power.
Fischl: You act so arrogant under that dark cloak of self-obsession. But that's not your true nature.
Fischl: You're no Prinzessin. You're just a narcissistic speck of dust hiding in my shadow! You are the true loser, the one who's holding me back!
Immernacht Fischl: Oof!
Fischl: You hide your fear and cowardice behind a facade of thorns and self-loathing. You are far weaker than me.
Fischl: Now give it back!
Immernacht Fischl: Wh—What?
Fischl: Return to me what is rightfully mine! The Immernachtreich, the castle, my people... and, most importantly, my companion, Oz!
Oz: Oh, mein Fräulein, you speak with such eloquence and vigor now. You've truly matured into the Prinzessin.
Fischl: You've got some nerve opening your beak, traitor!
Oz: No, mein Fräulein, I've come here to prove something to you all.
Oz: As we all know, Oz will always follow Fischl, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung. It should make no difference whose side I am on, because you're both Fischl.
Oz: But consider this: When I switched sides, you did not lose your identity, did you?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Indeed. These are words of wisdom.
Fischl: What do you mean "my identity"?
Oz: Whom do you suppose "Fischl" truly is?
Fischl: ...Huh?
Oz: This is my question to you, mein Fräulein.
Fischl: Fischl is... well... Fischl is...
Immernacht Fischl: She's a loser... a coward who refuses to confront her true self behind the fantasies and lies.
Oz: No, you are wrong.
Fischl: Fischl... is... me?
Oz: Ah, you caught on most rapidly.
Fischl: Huh? ...That's it?
Oz: Indeed, mein Fräulein. Fischl is sometimes the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, and other times not. She may be courageous and arrogant, but she may also be weak and cowardly.
Oz: Fischl is you. Both noble and humble, she is a first-rate adventurer with few friends and the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, the Sovereign of the Immernachtreich.
Oz: Fischl is both timid and strong. She's afraid of others' gossip, yet yearns for their respect.
Oz: Most importantly, Fischl is often self-deprecating, beating herself up countless times, yet she always finds a way to rise again.
Oz: Mein Fräulein, no one merits the name Fischl more than you do. It's a complex yet simple name that represents the beauty of dreams and liberty.
Oz: With or without loyal admirers, Amy will always be Fischl. You are Fischl, the enlightened one who has always carried that belief in her heart.
Fischl: ..."May my people be freed from the shackles of ancient decrees."
Oz: Thank you for creating the Immernachtreich and giving us a homeland, for authoring the "Hymn of the Holy Land" in your subconscious, which offered us hope for a bright future.
Oz: Please embrace your darkness and return to your true form, Your Highness.
Immernacht Fischl: ...
Fischl: ...
Paimon: Whoa! Fancy-dress Fischl vanished! Wait a minute... and now she's back?
Mona: The shadow seems to have returned to Fischl's heart, where it belongs.
Fischl: ...Hahaha, everyone, lend me your ears!
Xinyan: There she is!
Fischl: Hehe, citizens of the Immernachtreich! Do you hear my summons?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, Your Highness!
Mona: Ugh, there she goes again, I am so done with this...
Fischl: Oz speaks the words of truth. Today is a grand occasion, for it is the day that I seize back my heart and reclaim control of my kingdom. I hereby announce...
Fischl: Welcome to the Immernachtreich!
Paimon: Yaaay!

## Talk 12

Fischl: (What a wonderful day. I reclaimed my heart and became the true Prinzessin der Verurteilung.)
Fischl: (The Immernachtreich really appeared. Even so, I know that all the negative emotion I've been harboring in my heart will not simply go away.)
Fischl: (And that's okay. I'll carry these imperfections with me as I fight on, because I now know that what I have is unique and wonderful.)
Paimon: Fischl, the stage is all set up outside! Wanna go check it out?
Oz: Lady Paimon, do watch your words.
Paimon: Oh, right! Okay, Your Highness, wouldst thou care to venture outdoors and... checketh stuff out?
Traveler: Pffft...
Fischl: Ahem! How dare you, retainer of mine, mock the great and dignified Prinzessin der Verurteilung?
Traveler: I'm not mocking you.
Fischl: ...Hehe, I concur!
Fischl: Now let us rejoice and celebrate this historic moment for the Immernachtreich!
Oz: Oh, what mein Fräulein means is that she entreats you to celebrate the arrival of the Immernachtreich with utmost zeal and great joy...
Paimon: Alright, alright, we get it... Please don't translate her words back into Fischlspeak...
Mona: ...Ugh...
Mona: Watching a theater performance in a nation like this must be quite an experience.
Mona: As for the puzzle I'm working on... I should have an answer soon.
Paimon: Oh, there's something we've gotta do! Your Highness, Oz, please excuse us for a moment.
Oz: Very well, see you soon.
Paimon: C'mon, let's try to contact Venti again.
Traveler: Okay.
Dodocommunication Device: Dodoco!
Dodocommunication Device: Dodoco! Dodoco!
Dodocommunication Device: Oh? It's you.
Traveler: Whose voice is that?
Traveler: I don't think I've ever heard it before?
Paimon: Huh? That isn't the Tone-Deaf Bard?
Traveler: I'm sorry, who are you?
Dodocommunication Device: You're right, we've never met before.
Dodocommunication Device: I know you want to communicate with someone beyond the islands, but you can't do that right now. So I cut off your connection.
Paimon: Huh!?
Dodocommunication Device: Wouldn't you rather find out the answer for yourself than ask someone else? The fantastic mirage represents the "deep dream," the most fundamental reflection of the human heart.
Dodocommunication Device: Go see for yourself. Witness everything with your own eyes, and when this is all over, tell me what you feel about it.
Traveler: ...She hung up.
Paimon: #Traveler, who the heck was that!?
Paimon: This is weird. How was she able to cut off our connection to Venti... and why would she wanna know what you feel?
Paimon: Hmm... Nope! Paimon doesn't get it!
Traveler: Me neither.
Paimon: It's kinda eerie, but... but Paimon will protect you! Paimon will be there for you no matter what!
Traveler: Okay. Let's keep this between us for now.
Traveler: (There was no trace of malice in her words. It seemed like she was reaching out for something.)
Traveler: (I'm not sure what answer she's looking for from me, but I will wait until I've seen everything.)
Traveler: I'm just happy to see you back to your normal self.
