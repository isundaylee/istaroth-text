Traveler: About Rana...
Sudabeh: Rana said she was leaving for a trip. It looked like she would be away for a long time...
Sudabeh: It does make me a little sad, but this is an opportunity for me to grow up while Rana's away!
Sudabeh: Once I've grown up, I'll just show up in front of Rana and surprise her!
