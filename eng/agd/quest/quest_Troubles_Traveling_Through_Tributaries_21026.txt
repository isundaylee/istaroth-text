# Troubles Traveling Through Tributaries

Yue Chuan: The handwriting in this bottled letter seems to belong to a child...
Yue Chuan: "Little Meng"? Who's that?
Traveler: Huh? Is that drifting bottle...
Yue Chuan: Traveler? Judging from your tone, you know the person who wrote this letter, don't you?
Traveler: I guess...
Yue Chuan: Ah, so that's how it is. Quite the thinker too, this kid. Wanting to become mature...
Yue Chuan: You know what? I think he'd gain a lot from taking a little trip outside to broaden his horizons.
Paimon: Huh. Little Meng did say that he'd like to travel outside Liyue Harbor...
Paimon: But we invited him that time, didn't we? Why didn't he just agree then?
Yue Chuan: Hahaha, I suppose that's a wee bit of what you might call a boy's "stubbornness."
Yue Chuan: It's his troubles, and he wants to solve them himself, you know? Can't be relying on others all the time.
Paimon: But he's not going to solve this problem by floating a bottle downstream...
Yue Chuan: Well, yes. And that's where a reliable adult comes in, no?
Yue Chuan: Come on, Traveler. Let's write this kid a letter together, shall we?
Yue Chuan: Let's tell the kid about all the fascinating things waiting for him in the outside world.
Yue Chuan: That said... Well, it's not like I've been to too many places, so you're in charge of the details, Traveler.
Traveler: Let's write about the towering ruins shrouded in raging winds...
Yue Chuan: Whoa, whoa there. Slow down, I'm still writing over here...
Yue Chuan: Hmm... This goes here... and we write that there...
Yue Chuan: Alright! That's a wrap â€” wow, we sure wound up writing a lot...
Yue Chuan: Honestly, just listening to you talk about your travels makes me want to travel myself!
Traveler: It's not bad at all.
Yue Chuan: Ah, but at my age, there's too much business to attend to. Traveling willy-nilly is just not something I can do.
Yue Chuan: Well, I've put this letter into the drifting bottle. Send it down the river.
Traveler: Let's mention the archipelago surrounded by thundering storms...
Traveler: Let's talk about the island that the Electro Archon split in two...
Traveler: It's a kid from Liyue Harbor...

### Additional Talk 1

Yue Chuan: Well, I've put this letter into the drifting bottle. Send it down the river.

### Additional Talk 2

Yue Chuan: How did it go? Have you sent the bottle off on its way?
Traveler: Will Little Meng really receive it?
Yue Chuan: Heh. Usually, it would be a difficult thing. Impossible, even.
Paimon: Then what was the point of us doing all that?
Yue Chuan: Haha, relax. I did say that a certain responsible adult would help him.
Yue Chuan: Do you know of a place called Sumeru?
Yue Chuan: I have a few friends who are businessmen. They are currently planning to get into the mushroom market, so they're going there to perform market surveys.
Yue Chuan: But as you know, "market surveys" tend to also leave much time open for leisure.
Yue Chuan: Since that kid called Little Meng wants to travel, I can ask those friends of mine if they can bring another person along.
Yue Chuan: Don't worry about it. I'll handle all the arrangements.
Yue Chuan: I've made another copy of the letter for other purposes. As for the bottle... Let it go on its way, though I doubt anyone will pick it up.
Traveler: Thanks for helping.
Yue Chuan: Isn't fulfilling the dreams of children something adults should do? Relax, you can leave this matter to me.
Yue Chuan: Ah, yes. I should ask those friends of mine to dress a bit better. Scaring people just won't do...
Traveler: Why are you so willing to help Little Meng?

Check: Yue Chuan's drifting bottle was only just released, and hasn't floated off very far yet.
