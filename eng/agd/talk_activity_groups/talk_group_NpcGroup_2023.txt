## Talk

Traveler: Do you have anything else?
Linlang: Well, take this chunk of rock, for example. Looks perfectly ordinary, but in fact it came from a star.
Linlang: A very long time ago, a star fell from the sky. The force of the impact when it hit the ground is what turned it this color on the outside.
Linlang: Hmm? What do you mean, looks like a regular chunk of ore?
Linlang: ...Wait, no, you're right, sorry. I grabbed the wrong one. This is just a regular chunk of ore.
Linlang: Ugh, must be the suppliers. They're always trying to sneak the odd dud into the mix... so frustrating...
Linlang: Please, take it off my hands would you? I never want to see it again.

## Talk

Linlang: Hello! Can I help you?

## Talk

Traveler: You are...?
Linlang: I am Linlang, the owner of Xigu Antiques.
Linlang: I'm very sorry, but the shop is not open yet. If you want to browse the shop, please find me at Xigu Antiques later.
Traveler: Tell me about Xigu Antiques.
Linlang: A fellow antique collector, are you?
Linlang: In that case, I do hope you will come to the store tonight.
Linlang: Right now, though, I am taking my post-breakfast walk. Apologies.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Linlang: Bye. It was a pleasure meeting you.

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing?
Linlang: Oh, I'm just taking a stroll nearby to relax. I'd like to admire the scenery one more time before the sun sets.
Linlang: This land has remained at peace for a thousand years now. But sometimes, I wonder — how did the people who walked this land a thousand years ago feel?
Linlang: I cannot know, yes, but our Lord certainly does — Rex Lapis, who has gently watched over this land for a millennium...
Linlang: ...I wonder, has there been anyone at all who has been privy to his feelings across this long period?

## Talk

Linlang: Welcome to my humble shop! We have some new items in store, if you would be so kind as to take a look at them.

## Talk

Traveler: Hello.
Linlang: Hello, I am Linlang, the owner of this store.
Linlang: Do you see anything you like?
Linlang: Please take as long as you need; there is plenty to see and no rush to choose.
Traveler: Anything you would recommend?
Linlang: Take a look at this piece of flint. It is a shard from the tip of the Geo Lord's polearm. Notice the ancient symbols written on there, with the masterful brushwork following the lines that naturally appear on the material's surface.
Linlang: Or this fossilized wood. It is a runner from a primordial tree, and legend says that this tree was so gigantic its root system spread throughout the entire world.
Linlang: You might also consider this bottle, which contains the venomous blood of an evil dragon that once wrought havoc on a neighboring land. Due to exposure to the air, the blood has now dried and turned to dust...
Linlang: ...However, the venom is so strong that one pinch of it would suffice to take out all the strongest men in a village. Heh.
Linlang: Beyond these, there are many other rarities and oddities in store, too. Feel free to peruse them at your leisure.
Traveler: Sounds dubious to me...
Linlang: Well, the value of an antique is whatever you make of it.
Linlang: There is a saying: "An antique's credibility is born of its owner's credulity." It is one's belief in an item as a historical relic that imbues it with meaning.
Linlang: By contrast, when you believe that an antique is fake, your denial of the item's value does not change the item in any way.
Linlang: The fact is, the items themselves hold no value for my customers. It is the stories attached to the items that hold the real value.
Linlang: There's another saying, how does it go... "As long as you have a good story to tell, you'll always find a way forward..." The same principle applies to antiques.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Linlang: Goodbye. Come back any time.

## Talk

Traveler: I'd like to buy some antiques.
Linlang: Yes, please browse as you like. You'll find that our antiques here are worth every Mora.

## Talk

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Linlang: Impressive, wasn't it? Even in death, the gods pass in glory, unlike the surreptitious departure of mortals... I'm glad I was able to witness an event of such magnificence.
Linlang: It's just a shame that I couldn't have met him, or talked to him about my dreams...
Linlang: Ah, what I am saying? Sorry about that.

## Talk

Linlang: Hi, I'm Linlang. I run an antiques shop called Xigu Antiques... I don't know if we've met?
Linlang: There's an abiding sense of nostalgia in the air at Lantern Rite... Normally I only get that feeling in my shop; I love it, it makes me feel so at home.
Linlang: Lantern Rite is much more ancient than any of the antiques in my shop, though.
Linlang: Antiquity has real value. I should know, I make my living off that fact. So make the most of this very precious time of year.
