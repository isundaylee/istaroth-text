Traveler: A gentleman from Sumeru?
Cheriez: Yes. He seems to work at the Akademiya, and decided to travel here during a vacation.
Cheriez: I've heard that he's very meticulous in research and in life. He found me through several layers of relationships, and invited me to be his guide.
Cheriez: Which is fine, of course. I've got lots of free time, so I can accompany him anywhere.
Cheriez: But compared to traveling itself, he seems to enjoy designing itineraries more â€” he even wanted to carefully calculate the length of aquabus rides.
