# Darknight Hero's Alibi


## Talk 1

Paimon: Master Diluc! Paimon has something important to tell you—
Diluc: Yes... about Kaeya...
Diluc: I should have known he would see this as the perfect opportunity to get back at me.
Paimon: Sounds like there's a bit of bad blood between you guys then?
Diluc: I shan't get into that now. More importantly, the Knights of Favonius are responding more or less as I had anticipated.
Diluc: All we need to do now is think of a counter plan.
Traveler: Steer clear of the tavern, for starters.
Diluc: That won't work. It will only arouse the Knights' suspicion if I don't show up as they're expecting.
Diluc: That's what Kaeya is counting on.
Paimon: Hmm... so what are we gonna do?
Diluc: Patience. Let me think for a moment...
Diluc: ...
Diluc: If they intend to monitor me, then so be it.
Diluc: We can use this to create the perfect alibi.
Paimon: What's an alabla— an alibi?
Diluc: If you want to find out, maybe you can do me a small favor first.
Paimon: Oh come on! Why do you love cliff hangers so much?
Diluc: In Mondstadt, Mist Flowers are most commonly found in a region just *northwest of the winery*.
Diluc: If you could gather some for me, I'd be most grateful. I will make other preparations here in the meantime.
Traveler: Do you have any ideas?

## Talk 2

Paimon: And then? That's it?
Paimon: How long does it take before...
Paimon: *squelch squelch*
Paimon: Holy moley, it really does attract slimes! ...And even more than we expected...
Diluc: It appears the potency is greater than anticipated...
Diluc: We'd better get rid of them before they wreak havoc on the manor.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Whew... Such a powerful effect from such a small amount of extract. At least we didn't go picking wild flowers for nothing.
Paimon: Alright! So can you tell us what your plan is now, Master Diluc?
Diluc: Yes. The plan is...
Diluc: ...and so I expect it to all go down without a hitch.
Paimon: Hmm... Are you sure it will work?
Paimon: You're the only person in the plan...
Diluc: I have persevered alone from the start.
Diluc: Now, I alone must face what lies ahead.
Paimon: Well... if you already made up your mind...
Paimon: #But until that moment comes, Traveler and Paimon can still help you out where we can. Isn't that right, Traveler?
Traveler: Sure.
Diluc: I am indeed indebted to you. I shall see you at the *tavern*, as per the plan.
Traveler: If the price is right.
Paimon: Hey! Don't be so cheeky!

## Talk 4

Diluc: Greetings, Mr. Huffman of the Knights of Favonius. To what do I owe the pleasure at this hour?
Huffman: ...Oh, erm, nothing... I'm merely procrastinating. I thought I might indulge myself with a beverage or two.
Huffman: Ah, Traveler! Fancy meeting you here.
Paimon: Oh, we were in the mood for an evening stroll.
Diluc: What would you like to drink?
Huffman: I'll have a Dandelion Wine, I suppose.
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon wants apple juice!
Traveler: I also forgot to bring mine.
Traveler: Can I start a tab?
Paimon: #...Aw, but Paimon forgot to bring her coin pouch! Traveler, do you have any Mora on you?
Diluc: Then I must regretfully ask you to come back when you can pay.
Diluc: Apologies, we do not give credit here.
Huffman: Well in that case... let this be my treat.
Paimon: No need! We'll be back in a jiffy~

## Talk 5

Huffman: ...Captain Kaeya is no doubt a formidable knight, but he also brings us more than his share of hassle...
Huffman: No, this isn't right. I should not be talking about my superior in such a manner. If he were to overhear me...
Paimon: We're back! Is my apple juice ready?
Diluc: One moment.
City Gate Guard: Mr. Huffman, Mr. Huffman! A situation at the side gate! Everyone to the side gate!
Huffman: What is it? What happened?
City Gate Guard: It's... Slimes, Mr. Huffman.
Huffman: Slimes? You see them all the time, what's the big panic?
City Gate Guard: We do, but... Sir, there are more slimes out there now than all the slimes I've seen in my life added together!
Paimon: Ahh... Whoa...
Huffman: Surely this couldn't be the Abyss Order's secret weapon...
Huffman: But... I have another matter to attend to here—
Diluc: Oh? The matter of your Dandelion Wine?
Huffman: N—No, I... That's not what I meant...
Diluc: Hmph. So this is how the Knights of Favonius conduct themselves in a crisis.
Diluc: The Abyss Order is encroaching on the city gates, and your response is to sit here... drinking wine?
Diluc: It's like I've always said. The Knights are not to be trusted.
Huffman: I...
Huffman: *sigh* Master Diluc is right, my conduct here has been below par.
Huffman: I shall set off at once. But first...
Huffman: #Traveler, may I have a quiet word?
Paimon: Huh?
Huffman: Shh, keep your voice down. I presume you know what this is about. Please watch Diluc for me — do not let him leave under any circumstances!
Huffman: I must head to the side gate, but I'll be back shortly. I'm counting on you!
Diluc: Good. That's him out of the way.
Paimon: Everything's going according to plan!
Diluc: I must get going too. I won't have a second to spare if I'm to be back in time.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Classic Master Diluc — not a baddie left standing.
Diluc: Nothing more than a few hilichurls.
Diluc: No time to chat. I don't know how long those slimes will keep Huffman occupied. Best get back to the *tavern*.

## Talk 7

Diluc: It seems Huffman hasn't yet returned.
Diluc: We made it in time.
Huffman: *panting* ...The situation is sorted now. I never expected that the Abyss Order's army would turn out to be nothing more than a few slimes.
Diluc: That is a surprise.
Diluc: Perhaps the Knights' true calling is to be slime exterminators. Who knows, domestic pest control may turn out to be a more valuable use of your resources.
Huffman: Master Diluc, please, have you no respect at all...
Huffman: #Traveler, how come you're sweating so much? You didn't leave, did you?
Traveler: No, it's just really warm in here.
Huffman: Is it...? But if that's the case, why are you also out of breath?
Paimon: Uh-oh, Huffman is getting suspicious!
Huffman: Hmm...
Huffman: Excuse me, sir. Might I be so bold as to inquire...
Huffman: ...Did you see Master Diluc— I mean, today's bartender... Did you see him leave just now?
Paimon: Yikes! He's asking other customers... We're done for!
Traveler: ...
Jack: Master Diluc? Why no, he's been behind the bar this entire time.
Huffman: I see...
Diluc: Mr. Huffman, your Dandelion Wine.
Diluc: You ought to get back after this. Send my regards to the rest of the Knights.
Huffman: Oh... Never mind, I must be going, I should report back. Here, take this as a token of my esteem.
Huffman: Hmm... How odd...
Paimon: Phew! That was too close! Paimon was sure we were toast...
Diluc: I foresaw this eventuality...
Diluc: ...So all the guests here tonight, save you two, are my own people from the Dawn Winery.
Paimon: They're all in on it?
Kaeya: Not all of them... Or should I say, not all of us.
Paimon: Kaeya!? Where did you come from?
Kaeya: I just picked a good spot to quietly sit and watch the show.
Paimon: Whaaa... You've been here this whole time!?
Kaeya: Correct. "The Darknight Hero's Alibi..." I think it's my favorite chapter so far. More intriguing than a fine wine.
Diluc: Hmph...
Diluc: So? You plan to report everything to the Knights of Favonius?
Kaeya: Haha... Come now Diluc, you know me better than that. I have no interest in exposing secrets.
Kaeya: I was just curious to see how far Mondstadt's Darknight Hero would really go.
Kaeya: And you did not disappoint.
Diluc: I have nothing to prove to you.
Kaeya: Oh, naturally.
Kaeya: I must say though, one thing I didn't see coming is that the mighty Darknight Hero would actually need help from other people...
Diluc: Sorry, we're closing. Please see yourselves out.
Kaeya: Alright, alright... I have no further need of wine to entertain myself tonight, in any case.
Kaeya: Just one last thing before I go.
Diluc: It had better be the very last thing.
Kaeya: I feel strangely comforted by the fact you now have an assistant, Diluc.
Diluc: ...
Kaeya: I hope you all have a wonderful night.
Paimon: What was all that about?
Diluc: Don't mind him.
Diluc: Thank you for all your help with this matter. This is a token of my gratitude.
Paimon: Woooow! Thanks Master Diluc!
Diluc: I'm in the habit of working alone, but I did enjoy having your assistance this time.
Diluc: In the future, if there's anything you ever need, you can come to me for help.
Traveler: I just did some squats.
Huffman: Is that so? But why now of all times, for the love of Barbatos...

## Talk 8

Diluc: In Mondstadt, Mist Flowers are most commonly found in a region just *northwest of the winery*.
Diluc: Once you've gathered enough *Mist Flowers* I will discuss the plan further with you.

## Talk 9

Diluc: Ah, you're back.
Diluc: Allow me to introduce the winery's master brewer—
Connor: So many Mist Flowers... Great! I can't wait to see how this turns out!
Diluc: So, are you certain the equipment can withstand this level of purity?
Connor: Oh my... my goodness, the winery owner himself is addressing me directly!
Connor: Don't worry, sir! It is always my honor to serve you, even if it means risking my life!
Paimon: Huh? What's so life-threatening about this?
Connor: Please excuse me — I must get to work!
Paimon: What's he gonna do with a bunch of Mist Flowers?
Diluc: Long story short...
Diluc: A few days ago, the winery was experimenting with some new flavors. They wanted to see if Mist Flower can truly add a crisp and refreshing taste.
Diluc: Sure enough, they discovered that the flower's extract is truly potent.
Paimon: So the new batch is selling like hot cakes?
Diluc: No, not potent in terms of attracting customers, but slimes.
Diluc: Slimes need to extract elemental energy to survive... For them, this substance is simply irresistible.
Diluc: So I thought to myself, "I wonder how much trouble I could cause now that I know this..."
Connor: *bang crash wallop*...
Paimon: Yikes! What was that noise?
Connor: Ah... C—Cold... so c—cold... Master Diluc, purification complete, sir! B—But the equipment is...
Diluc: Marvelous work. Don't fret about the equipment, I shall have my butler order more immediately.
Paimon: "Marvelous! Jolly-ho! Spiffing! Somebody fetch the butler!" Paimon never knew you had to be so well-spoken to get a job in the alcohol industry.
Diluc: This is what I was talking about.
Diluc: Mist Flower extract... or for our purposes, "Elemental Bait."
Paimon: Wow, it really has a strong elemental... whiff! Can we test it out?
Diluc: Sprinkle a little on the ground over there — careful, just a small amount.

## Talk 10

Connor: The method for obtaining Mist Flower extract is kind of my own invention... So please keep it a secret until I've managed to publish it.

## Talk 11

Diluc: Hmm? You'd better get on with it, I can't wait all evening.

## Talk 12

Huffman: It's only a couple of fruit juices, really, let me get them for you.

## Talk 13

Diluc: Let's discuss the plan some more after we've dealt with these slimes.
