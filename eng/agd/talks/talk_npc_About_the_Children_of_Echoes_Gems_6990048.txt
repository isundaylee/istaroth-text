Traveler: About the Children of Echoes' Gems...
Paimon: Hey, so the valleys here are just bursting with shiny gemstones!
Paimon: You don't come across that kind of opportunity every day! Why don't we start a dig somewhere? If we're lucky, we might unearth something super valuable. Then we'd never have to worry about running out of Mora again!
Traveler: Hmm... But how would you actually know when you've hit the jackpot? Can you even tell which stones are the valuable ones?
Paimon: Um, well... As long as something's bright and shiny, then it must be worth a lot, right?
Traveler: That makes us sound just like...
Paimon: Hehe, except we're in Natlan now â€” so instead of "evil dragon," it's "noble Saurian"!
Paimon: #"O brave and keen Traveler, let this noble Saurian lead you to the most precious gem in the world!"
Traveler: Great! Except she can't tell which stones are the valuable ones, so how's that gonna work?
Traveler: ...evil hoarding dragons in children's fairytales!
