# Next Time, On King of Invokations...


## Talk 1

Fukumoto: *sigh* I want to go back to Inazuma... How could this happen to me...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Fukumoto: Traveler? *sigh* Don't even mention the novel. Those researchers working on Genius Invokation TCG are barely holding it together.
Fukumoto: According to a researcher I know quite well, the team encountered all kinds of problems that could only be described as baffling...
Fukumoto: For example, a Haravatat researcher suddenly asked a question one day.
Fukumoto: He said that if the effect descriptions on the cards are too long, it might discourage people who aren't used to reading long blocks of text from playing the game.
Fukumoto: Researchers are used to reading large chunks of text and aren't affected by this issue, but the long descriptions could very well turn potential players away.
Fukumoto: So he suggested cutting the amount of text on some cards in half to make them easier to read.
Traveler: Is that really necessary?
Fukumoto: It's not a problem to me... But the researchers are still working hard on this issue. After all, it's about the player's experience, and the fewer problems, the better.
Fukumoto: Anyway... There's an even bigger problem. They promised to help me find models for my novel, but something went wrong with that, too.
Fukumoto: Remember? I told you earlier about a researcher who said they'd introduce me to Tighnari and Cyno, and ask them to be the inspirations for my novel.
Fukumoto: But they're so busy. I don't think I can count on them for a while...
Traveler: What will you do?
Fukumoto: The researcher who received me was not able to help me with this, but he gave me an idea.
Fukumoto: He said Cyno sometimes goes to Puspa Café to play cards.
Fukumoto: If I want... I can try my luck there first. Or maybe they'll help me get in touch when they're free.
Traveler: And... what are your thoughts?
Fukumoto: *sigh* By the time they're free, I'll have finished writing the novel.
Fukumoto: I guess I'll go myself and see if I can find Cyno.
Fukumoto: But if I'm lucky enough to meet Cyno at the café, how should I even introduce myself to him? What a dilemma...
Traveler: I can help.
Fukumoto: Really!? That's amazing! But how did you... Uh, you know what? I'm not gonna pry further.
Fukumoto: What are we waiting for then? Let's head to Puspa Café right now! Hope we'll be able to catch Cyno...
Traveler: I know Cyno pretty well.
Traveler: How will you get in touch?
Traveler: Is it really that long...?
Traveler: Got writer's block?

## Talk 2

Fukumoto: Shh... I—Isn't that Cyno?
Fukumoto: Look at his outfit, his hairstyle, and that hair color... This is exactly what a protagonist in a card game novel should look like!
Traveler: This has no rhyme nor reason...
Fukumoto: Heh, just trust my instincts on the market. But now's not a good time to explain...
Fukumoto: Traveler, please ask Cyno to be the model for my novel... I'm counting on you!
Traveler: I actually know quite a lot of people who can fit into this category...
Fukumoto: Really? That's great. I'm working on the third book of "King of Invokations," and this time, I'm not going to base it on the gameplay mechanics of Genius Invokation TCG.
Fukumoto: I'm going to create an all-new way of playing. For instance... I could get all cards to be suspended mid-air on the field. Players will have to collect cards as they consider their next move, all the while preventing their opponent from collecting cards themselves...
Fukumoto: Hahaha! I'm getting excited just thinking about it! But we don't have time for this right now...

## Talk 3

Cyno: ...Hmm, this combination of cards isn't so bad.
Cyno: But they're not strong enough to deal with quick attacks...
Traveler: What are you up to, Cyno?
Cyno: #Traveler? I didn't expect to see you here.
Cyno: I'm in the middle of trying to build a Genius Invokation deck with a relatively slow attack speed.
Cyno: I'm hoping that the deck would allow the player to obtain an abundance of resources and plenty of powerful cards...
Cyno: But to be honest, it's hard to build a deck like that...
Cyno: Currently, in the Genius Invokation TCG community, some players prefer to use cards with fast attack speeds.
Cyno: At the beginning of the game, they play a large number of cards in one go in order to swiftly defeat their opponent.
Cyno: But I'm no fan of this tactic. I prefer to continuously accumulate resources in different ways...
Cyno: Seizing every possible opportunity, building up my advantage, and eventually securing the victory...
Fukumoto: Yes, yes! Wonderful! You're just like the main character in my novel!
Fukumoto: Sorry! Uh... I'm...
Traveler: This is Fukumoto.
Traveler: This is the author of "King of Invokations."
Fukumoto: Hello, General Mahamatra. I don't suppose you've heard of me...
Cyno: I've read your novel. It's very good.
Fukumoto: I'm truly honored!
Cyno: In the novel, every time the protagonist is at a disadvantage, he always manages to get a card that wasn't in his deck through various means, then defeats his opponent. This left a lasting impression on me.
Cyno: I understand that writing novels requires taking a creative license, but this way of winning is a departure from the fundamental mechanics of Genius Invokation TCG.
Fukumoto: About that, well... Although I do play Genius Invokation TCG a lot, I'm not really good at it... And if you write about the duels with a competitive mindset, it wouldn't make for an interesting story.
Cyno: Hmm, is that so? Well, as luck would have it, I've just built two decks of cards, so we can play a few rounds of Genius Invokation TCG here. Maybe you'll find some inspiration.
Traveler: (Now they are about to play cards...)
Traveler: (This guy simply wants to play cards...)
Fukumoto: Eh? Playing with... with you? I'd love to, but the truth is...
Traveler: I'll explain.
Traveler: About Fukumoto's request...
Black Screen Text: You tell Cyno about Fukumoto's request...
Cyno: You're asking me to model for the illustrations in "King of Invokations"? That's certainly no problem.
Fukumoto: Great! Traveler, quickly! Help me take some pictures!

## Talk 4

Black Screen Text: You take several pictures of Cyno very quickly...

## Talk 5

Black Screen Text: You take several pictures of Cyno very quickly...
Fukumoto: This has been a big help. I'm sure Asagiri will make an excellent illustration!
Fukumoto: Thank you very much, Cyno. I'll be sure to send you a copy of the novel as soon as it's published.
Fukumoto: Uh, Cyno, the two decks you're holding are...?
Cyno: Didn't you promise to play a few games of Genius Invokation TCG with me earlier?
Fukumoto: Eh!? I—I'm not very good at it, so uh... Traveler! You're definitely better than me!
Traveler: I've never played before.
Traveler: You're better at this.
Cyno: Then the matter is settled. Here, take this quick attack deck.
Cyno: I'm going to use this relatively slower deck to see how I can deal with your attacks.
Fukumoto: I'll do my best, Cyno...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Fukumoto: Cyno, your play style is so... slow and deliberate...
Cyno: It's just an intuitive strategy.
