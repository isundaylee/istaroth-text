# Talk Dialog

Petit Lumiere: How about it? Ready to try your hand at filming?
Traveler: Yep.
Petit Lumiere: Excellent. I've already set up the scene, the actors are ready, and all is awaiting your arrival.
Traveler: About your older brother...
Petit Lumiere: Lumiere is much older than I, but that poses no obstacle to us brothers working together.
Petit Lumiere: We were not yet famous when we filmed "The Arrival of an Aquabus" and "Employees Leaving the Factory."
Petit Lumiere: We two brothers have done everything together, because no one was willing to assist directors who were not yet famous, haha!
Petit Lumiere: If you are interested, you can go see those two films.
Traveler: I'm not ready yet.
Petit Lumiere: No problem, I understand. A quality product requires time to incubate and nurture.
