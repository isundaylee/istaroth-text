Aikawa Susumu: Boss! The Mikawa Flower Festival was a huge success for us! We had three times more visitors than usual!
Aikawa Susumu: Based on what we've made so far, I think we'll be able to make... this much!
Yumemizuki Mizuki: That's great news! We might even beat Yae Publishing house this month...
Yae Miko: Oh? You look pleased about something... Having a party without me?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Oh, hehe... It's nothing...
Yae Miko: I forgot to share some good news with you...
Yae Miko: Thirty percent of the proceeds from the festival have been transferred to Yae Publishing House. We're expecting record profit this month... Don't you think congratulations are in order?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: What!?
Aikawa Susumu: W—Well, boss... I guess congratulations ARE in order... This is our 333rd time competing against Yae Publishing House in sales, and our best showing to date — second place!
Yae Miko: Hehehe...
Ei: ...May this be a night of sweet dreams for all.
