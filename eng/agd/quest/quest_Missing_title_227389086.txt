## Talk 1

Akashi: Ugh. Guess this just isn't my day.
Traveler: What's wrong?
Akashi: The results of my shooting training have been getting worse and worse. One of these days, I swear I'll end up hitting myself in the knee!
Traveler: Why are you practicing archery in a place like this?
Akashi: Bah! It's all the fault of that Jibashiri — he suggested I do this! ...You know what? I wonder if all of them aren't just a bunch of sadists...
Akashi: By the way, do you know anything about Unagi farming? I feel like there isn't much of a future for my archery, so you know, might as well do something else.
Traveler: Do those two things have anything in common?
Akashi: Oh, right, never mind. Looks like you don't know the first thing about unagi farming.
Akashi: You need to catch some unagi fry first, for starters, but they're so small that you can barely see them with the naked eye.
Akashi: So I got to thinking that since archers can hit targets from very far away, they must have good eyes. As such, I went to ask some experienced Jibashiri about how to train my eyesight.
Akashi: "Akashi, you have to take training slowly. You can only make steadier progress once you've laid a good foundation."
Akashi: "Unagi fry are small and move about wildly, so you need to start with static targets. And not ones that are too close, either — if you want to do things right, you've got to do things seriously."
Akashi: So I followed his instructions, practicing archery here. But I haven't hit the target even once... Is it even possible, anyway?
Akashi: Actually, do you wanna give it a go? If you stand on that stone platform, you can see the targets. Hit them all, and it'll be considered a success.
Traveler: Sure, leave it to me.
Akashi: Alright then, let me see your true abilities. Don't forget to come find me when you're done!

## Talk 2

Akashi: Huh, so you couldn't hit them either.
Akashi: I guess this just isn't my day. Something must be hindering my progress somehow.
Akashi: Would you like to try a couple more times? I mean, t's not like the targets are gonna run away like those unagi fry!

## Talk 3

Akashi: Wow! You got it!
Akashi: *sigh* You looked like a real pro out there, though. I doubt someone without proper training like myself could reach your standards — not even if I trained for a few years more.
Akashi: And I haven't seen a live, jumping unagi for a long time either, what with coming here every day to train and all.
Akashi: Do you like unagi, by the way?
Traveler: I do.
Akashi: Is that so? As for me, I love them — so much so that I'd love to try raising some one day. Don't you think they look cute?
Akashi: Well, unagi on a dinner platter are best of course. Lovely to look at and to taste — one heck of a combination!
Akashi: Speaking of which, do you think I've got my priorities wrong? I mean, I'm only practicing archery because I want to raise unagi, but I only want to do that because I love them.
Akashi: In the end, I love them when they're living free. So there's probably no point trying to raise them, you know?
Akashi: In any case, thanks for the demonstration. Please take these. Good luck!
Traveler: Not exactly my thing.
