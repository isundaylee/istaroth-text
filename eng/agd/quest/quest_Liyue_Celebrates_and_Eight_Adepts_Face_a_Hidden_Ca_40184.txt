# Liyue Celebrates and Eight Adepts Face a Hidden Calamity


## Talk 1

Paimon: What're all these Mora for? They're huge! And so shiny.
Lan Yan: Lady Yuheng said they're Fortune Coins. Go on, give them a rub, it'll bring you good luck.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Are these lanterns?
Xiangling: Nope! They're toys that shoot fireworks! New to this year's festival. You should try them, Paimon.

## Talk 3

Keqing: Here it is. This is a game for the street fair, where you duel with rattan figures. It's called "Immortal Combat."
Keqing: There are eight rattan figures in total, and thanks to some ingenious design work, they can move around on their own. Madame Lan took inspiration from the legend of the Eight Adepts. Astonishing, isn't it?
Paimon: Sounds amazing! But what are the Eight Adepts? Are they like, adepti?
Keqing: They're not actual adepti, but eight legendary people said to have had adeptus-like abilities — which earned them the title of the Eight Adepts.
Paimon: Wow! Paimon's never heard that story before...
Keqing: They were only around for a short time, and it was two or three thousand years ago. So their stories aren't nearly as well-known as those of the actual adepti.
Keqing: Also, did you notice this year's Mingxiao Lantern when you arrived in the harbor?
Paimon: Shaped like a huge tree, right?
Keqing: Yes. It's said that during the Archon War period, there was a divine mountain in Liyue with a giant tree on its summit. A tree who was also a god, named "Tao Dou."
Xiangling: Oh! I think I heard that one from a storyteller once — "The Sanctification of Tao Dou." So Tao Dou is the giant tree...?
Traveler: And this tree was also a god?
Keqing: Correct. Back then, people thought that behind Tao Dou was the realm of the dead, and if you committed grave sins in life, your soul would be unable to pass beyond that tree and into the afterlife.
Lan Yan: Even today, in my hometown people still say things like, "You'll never cross Mt. Tao Dou when you die." It's very insulting though, so don't go around repeating it...
Keqing: When the Archon War arrived, Tao Dou was dragged into the fighting, disturbing the realm of the dead. The boundary between life and death became blurred, and death began to encroach on the realm of the living.
Paimon: Oh no... and then what?
Lan Yan: That's where The Sanctification of Tao Dou comes in! The Eight Adepts rose up to solve the crisis, and laid down a great magic array to purify Tao Dou.
Keqing: Exactly. After that, Tao Dou's remains sank into the Ley Lines and became a border, separating the living of Liyue from the dead.
Paimon: Wait, THE border? The border between life and death? That's where it comes from?
Lan Yan: So the legends say, but who knows if it's true.
Paimon: Those Eight Adepts must be super powerful if they could purify a god... Are we sure they weren't just adepti?
Lan Yan: Yep — and in fact, their tale specifically emphasizes that most of them were ordinary humans!
Xiangling: If I remember right, they were from several groups that joined forces... a Guizang one, a Lianshan one, and...
Lan Yan: Right! The Three Hermits of Guizang, the Two Sages of Lianshan, and the Three Beasts of Tao Dou. Collectively, the Eight Adepts. The mainstream narrative holds that the Guizang Hermits and the Lianshan Sages were human.
Keqing: I know one of the hermits was "Wind Reader," said to be the founder of the ancient art of Qimen Divination.
Keqing: If I'm not mistaken, he hailed from the Twelve Tribes of Chenyu Vale. His descendants became the Lan clan, and kept the art of Qimen Divination alive. Madame Lan, correct me if I'm wrong?
Lan Yan: That's certainly what the clan genealogies claim, although my personal knowledge of Qimen Divination is very patchy.
Keqing: The second hermit's story is somewhat more amusing. He mastered the art of fishing with a rod and line, and became known to the people as the "Yunlai Angler."
Keqing: You may have heard of Yunlai Swordsmanship, which is the style I trained in. Both that style and its more ancient variant have their origins in the Yunlai Angler's rod-wielding techniques...
Xiangling: Seriously? ...Haha, did Xingqiu tell you that? 'Cause it sounds like something right out of a martial arts novel!
Paimon: So what about the third hermit?
Keqing: That would be the Wuwang Kid... also known as Old Man Wuwang. The story goes that he always presented himself in child form. As a hermit, his expertise lay with Qihuang sigils, which he used to catch demons, heal disease, and protect lives from the encroaching presence of death.
Keqing: The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor should be best acquainted with his story, since their founders were said to have studied under the Wuwang Kid.
Keqing: They were just ordinary people like you and me. But when faced with mounting disasters, they used what strength they had to guard the border between life and death. Fortunately, they were aided by their knowledge of a secret art, which the funeral parlor still practices to this day.
Lan Yan: So it's true? The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor really does have a secret art?
Xiangling: I heard from Hu Tao that she has a flaming staff handed down by her forebearers. Apparently, it has special powers, used for cleansing rituals...
Xiangling: But it could just be another one of her tall tales. ...Oh, you probably haven't met Hu Tao yet, have you? She's the director at the funeral parlor.
Lan Yan: I've never had the pleasure, but I've certainly heard of Director Hu Tao.
Paimon: Okay, well these Guizang Hermits sound pretty legit. How about the two sages and the three beasts? What's their story?
Keqing: One was Sage Hu, a master of gourd crafts, and the other was Sage Jian, an expert in bronze mirrors.
Keqing: Very little information survives on these two. All we know is that they practiced the secret art of Lianshan, earning them the title of the Two Sages of Lianshan.
Lan Yan: I heard there's a hidden palace deep in the mountains south of Stone Gate. Traditionally, that's believed to be where they retreated for cultivation.
Keqing: As for the three beasts, their retreat was Mt. Tao Dou, hence the "Three Beasts of Tao Dou." As their title suggests, those three were not humans.
Paimon: So what were they? Monsters or something...?
Keqing: They were... Ganyu?
Paimon: ...Huh? All three of them?
Ganyu: Happy Lantern Rite, everyone.
Paimon: Ohh, right! Ganyu's here, okay!
Traveler: Happy Lantern Rite, Ganyu.
Ganyu: I'm sorry... I hope I'm not interrupting anything?
Paimon: Of course not!
Keqing: What is it? Ningguang's back?
Ganyu: Yes. The others have arrived, too.
Keqing: Got it, thanks.
Keqing: My apologies, everyone, but I've got to go. Ganyu and I have some important work to attend to.
Paimon: Aw, what? Not you, too... seems like everyone's busy with work.
Ganyu: You know what it's like — the festival season is upon us, so it's all systems go at the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Don't worry, everything's fine.
Keqing: Yes, you should focus on enjoying everything that the street fair has to offer. And if you find anything is not to your satisfaction, we will welcome your feedback.
Keqing: Bye for now, everyone.
Traveler: One second, Ganyu...
Ganyu: #What is it, Traveler?
Traveler: ...Don't forget to take breaks. Look after yourself.
Xiangling: #Haha, Traveler's being especially nice today, checking in on everyone's wellbeing.
Paimon: #Well, what other option does {F#s}he have? It's not like {F#s}he can drag them away from their desks and force them to have fun against their will.
Ganyu: Thanks for your concern, we'll be sure to take care... and I hope you'll do the same.
Lan Yan: I actually have something I need to do as well, so I should get to the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
Xiangling: Oh, are you looking for Hu Tao? She's supposed to meet us here so we can grab lunch. Why don't you come with? If you don't mind the extra company, of course.
Lan Yan: Not at all, I'd love to! What a nice surprise!
Xiangling: Perfect! Hmm, Hu Tao should have joined us here by now... I guess her meeting overran. Why don't we head to the funeral parlor?
Paimon: Okay! Let's go!

## Talk 4

Black Screen Text: Earlier, just outside the funeral parlor...
Hu Tao: ...So in other words, Butler An, you'd like to go without the drums?
An Su: Exactly. Since this has come at such a festive time, I'd rather keep things low-key to avoid disturbing the celebrations.
Hu Tao: Understood. What about paper effigies for burning? We can do mansions, chariots, boats, or sedan chairs...
An Su: Sure, but let's stick with something small. His Lordship has never been a fan of ostentation.
Hu Tao: In that case... how about an effigy of a silk gown? Something to please the family, but not too over-the-top. Does that sound alright?
An Su: It sounds perfect. You think of everything, Director Hu.
Hu Tao: Great. And will you be providing your own cinerary casket?
An Su: Yes, His Lordship had one made two years ago, in fact. He sourced an excellent block of gloomwood, and had an artisan convert it into a casket. It's currently being stored at the old family house at Yilong Wharf.
Hu Tao: Gloomwood is a good choice. Flame-resistant, water-resistant, and insect-resistant. Now, what about the mourning tent and the procession? Did the family say what style they want?
Hu Tao: We can certainly keep them simple, but I wouldn't recommend foregoing them entirely. You don't want the public speculating about why the Feiyun Commerce Guild couldn't seem to afford a proper funeral.
An Su: It's like you read my mind — Master expressed the same concern. But he also said he has full confidence in the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's judgment in this area.
Hu Tao: Very well. Then my suggestion for the tent would be sloped rooves — one with a ridged spine, two of them curved at the top. Thirty-six seats, no more, no less, and all with fresh silk covers. But not just any silk — they should be decorated with the Feiyun symbols.
Hu Tao: At the front, we want a moon gate, a Grand Preceptor armchair, and bamboo railings. Sufficiently grand, but tasteful and measured. Would this be suitable, Butler An?
An Su: That sounds ideal. Oh, and we should put some rugs down. Make them tortoise-shell, His Lordship is very fond of that color.
Hu Tao: That can be arranged. How about the procession?
An Su: Master requested no music procession, but sixteen pallbearers. Nothing flashy — plain clothes will do, as long as they're smart and all dressed the same.
Hu Tao: And the carriage?
An Su: Open sedan chair please, with four pairs of white plaques and twenty pairs of red plaques.
Hu Tao: Any ceremonial weaponry and such?
An Su: Yes, two sets of gold weaponry and two sets of soul banners, four items per set.
Hu Tao: Okay, for the gold weaponry, a four-piece set would be the mace, battle axe, stirrup, and fist, so two each of those. And then we could do two clear passage banners, plus two each of the Flying Tiger, Flying Carp, and Flying Turtle banners.
An Su: That will do nicely.
Hu Tao: Alright, last thing: How about the hanging banner and the portrait pavilion?
An Su: For the hanging banner, we want an octagonal tube with eight tassels per corner, and a dome of red gauze covering the top. As for the portrait pavilion, we're looking to do one incense pavilion with two spare rooms — one as a changing room, the other as a display room. And we'd like a plain white cover over the whole thing.
Hu Tao: Did you want that embroidered?
An Su: Ah, I knew I missed something... The family neglected to consider that in their sorrow. But it's a minor detail. What would your suggestion be?
Hu Tao: Well, the Feiyun Commerce Guild is a large and prosperous family with four generations living under one roof. As the founder of this family, His Lordship could not be more blessed.
Hu Tao: Added to that, he has reached a ripe old age, lived a virtuous life, and is spending his final days in peace and comfort. All in all, he has lived a very complete life.
Hu Tao: In which case, I'd recommend embroidering a bats-of-longevity motif and a cranes-and-deer-of-youth motif, to pass on his good fortune to the next generation.
An Su: Excellent! I must say, Director Hu, you really understand your clients.
Hu Tao: Of course, think nothing of it... Huh? Ah, Ms. Baiwen.
Baiwen: Greetings, Director Hu. Lady Ningguang has arrived, and she would be most grateful if you could join her at Yujing Terrace.
Hu Tao: Wow, that was quick. Alright, I'll head over in two ticks.
Hu Tao: Butler An, my sincere apologies, but I'm afraid I have another meeting to get to.
An Su: Of course, I've taken plenty of your time already. Don't let me keep you.
Hu Tao: Ferry, can I leave you to follow up on the Feiyun funeral arrangements?
Ferrylady: Of course, Director. I'll handle it.
An Su: The Hu family is truly blessed. It seems their directors go from strength to strength with each generation.
Ferrylady: I agree. She was born for the job.
An Su: Ah yes — Madame Undertaker, I didn't get the chance to discuss payment with the director.
Ferrylady: There's no rush. I gathered from your conversation that the situation is still unfolding. This was just an initial meeting so that we can make advance preparations, yes?
An Su: That's right. Master asked me to come a few days ahead of time so that things aren't rushed at the last minute. On that note, please do keep everything strictly confidential for now. No public announcements.
Ferrylady: Of course. You have my word.
An Su: Thanks. Could I trouble you for a pro forma invoice? Easier for the family to review that way.
Ferrylady: I'll get that to you in due course... Hello, can I help you?
Xiangling: Hey, Ferry. We're looking for Hu Tao, is she here?
Ferrylady: You just missed her, unfortunately. She's attending a meeting elsewhere.
Lan Yan: Oh... Any idea when she'll be back?
Ferrylady: She didn't say, but she only left a moment ago. She could be some time.
Ferrylady: If it's anything urgent, I'd be happy to take a message for you, and I'll relay it to her as soon as she returns.
Lan Yan: Oh... No, it's nothing urgent...
Ferrylady: If you'd prefer to speak with her directly, you can always wait till she's free.
Paimon: Well this sucks. Paimon thought Hu Tao would be done with work by now.
Xiangling: I guess she's got more on her plate than we realized... Well, there's not much point in hanging around here. Why don't we go eat and come back later?
Paimon: Paimon is getting a little hungry, but shouldn't we wait for Hu Tao?
Xiangling: It sounded like she's gonna be a while. Besides, I can always fire up the stove again once she's back.
Paimon: Okay, sounds good! Madame Lan, you must be getting hungry too, right? You should come with us!
Lan Yan: ...
Xiangling: Madame Lan...?
Lan Yan: Oh! Sorry, I spaced out... Whatever works for you.
Xiangling: Alright Ferry, we'll head off then. Can you let Hu Tao know where we are when she gets back?
Ferrylady: Sure. Take care, everyone.
An Su: ...
Ferrylady: Butler An?
An Su: Ma'am, do you happen to know who that young lady with the black hair is?
Ferrylady: I haven't met her before, but that silver swallow hairpiece makes me wonder if she's from Chenyu Vale.
An Su: Chenyu Vale, hmm...
Ferrylady: Something the matter?
An Su: Well, it's just... So, the other day when I was out shopping, I ran into her and Master. They were chatting away, and I noticed that she showed him a very peculiar-looking rattan figure.
An Su: Later that day, as I was moving His Lordship to a more comfortable bedroom, I saw something underneath his bed... and would you know it, it was that same rattan figure!
An Su: There was some kind of spell written on it. It was icy-cold to the touch, and made the whole room chilly... The whole thing seems very sinister.
Ferrylady: Oh my goodness... Are you suggesting that there could be unnatural causes behind His Lordship's condition?
Ferrylady: Well, I've heard they practice Qimen magic in Chenyu Vale. Pentad Fortune Conveyance, Fate Transference, and the like...
An Su: The last thing I want to do is start suspecting anyone, but... with His Lordship bedridden, and Master urging me to start discussing funeral arrangements, I can't help but think...
An Su: Ahem! Sorry, look at me rambling away... I'm sure I'm just being paranoid... Please forget I said anything, and certainly don't repeat this to anyone else.
Ferrylady: Don't worry, Butler An. The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor understands the importance of discretion. Client confidentiality is paramount.

## Talk 5

Xiangling: Dad, I brought some friends over! I'm cooking today! ...Hmm? Dad? Daaad...
Chef Mao: Over here, Xiangling!
Paimon: Oh, there he is! He's over at Ying'er's place. Let's go say hi.
Paimon: Huh? Timaeus!? What's wrong with him?
Lan Yan: Hmm, that scent...
Ying'er: Ah, this is so embarrassing... A few days ago, he said he wanted to come and spend the festival with me, but he started to feel unwell as soon as he arrived last night, and now, he's gone and passed out...
Ying'er: I think maybe the journey took it out of him, or perhaps he caught a cold on the way... Anyway, I was about to take him to Bubu Pharmacy to see the doctor, so I asked Chef Mao to watch the store while I'm gone.
Paimon: Wait, you weren't gonna carry him all that way by yourself, were you? Let us help!
Ying'er: I couldn't possibly ask that of you...
Traveler: Don't mention it. Let's just get him to the doctor.
Ying'er: If you're sure... I'm very grateful for the help.
Lan Yan: Why don't I watch the store? As it happens, I know a thing or two about perfume.
Ying'er: I'm sorry, I don't believe I've had the pleasure?
Paimon: Oh! This is Madame Lan Yan, a craftswoman from Chenyu Vale. You can trust her!
Ying'er: Oh, a friend of yours then. Thank you, Madame Lan Yan, that would be a huge help.
Chef Mao: Xiangling, I guess that means we're free to head back. Let's get cooking, so the troops can feast on their triumphant return.
Xiangling: Hee-hee, great minds think alike, dad!
Xiangling: Go on, get Timaeus to Bubu Pharmacy. And don't forget to come eat when you're done!
Ying'er: Thank you all.

## Talk 6

Black Screen Text: Meanwhile, you bring Timaeus to Bubu Pharmacy, where Baizhu takes him to the back room for examination.
Black Screen Text: You are surprised to see two other familiar faces there...
Xingqiu: #Traveler, Paimon, it's been a long time.
Chongyun: Happy Lantern Rite.
Traveler: Happy Lantern Rite, Xingqiu and Chongyun.
Xingqiu: Thank you — here's hoping it will be...
Paimon: What do you mean by that? Oh no, did you get sick too?
Xingqiu: No, not me...
Chongyun: Xingqiu...
Xingqiu: It's alright, these are dear friends. The truth needn't be hidden from them.
Xingqiu: It's... my great-grandfather. A few days ago, he didn't have the strength to get out of bed, and now, he's slipped into a coma.
Paimon: Oh no! Sorry to hear that. That sounds really serious...
Xingqiu: It's not looking good. We've had several doctors come and see him, but none of them could tell what was wrong, and all left without even writing a prescription.
Paimon: None of them could figure out what it was? That seems strange...
Xingqiu: *sigh* Well, he is over a hundred years old now. It's just... we're struggling to come to terms with it.
Xingqiu: Our butler came to see me a few days ago, insisting that great-grandfather has been cursed. He urged me to get an exorcist involved.
Chongyun: So... I went to take a look, and inside His Lordship's room, there was definitely a strange chill in the air. But I'm confident it's not caused by evil spirits.
Traveler: Then what is it?
Chongyun: Well... this is just a theory, but I think that...
Xingqiu: It's fine. You can say.
Chongyun: It's... fetor of death. A sign that death is near.
Paimon: Oh no... Xingqiu, this must be so hard for you.
Xingqiu: Thank you. I'll be okay. Honestly, my father and grandfather are the hardest hit by it... But, we're as prepared as we can be under the circumstances.
Xingqiu: I believe my brother's already contacted the funeral parlor, and I'm here to see if Dr. Baizhu can help. My father and grandfather are at home fasting and praying.
Ying'er: Feeling any better?
Timaeus: Much better! I feel fit as a twiddle! I'm sure this is all because I forgot to eat breakfast.
Ying'er: It's "fit as a fiddle," dear. As in the instrument, not the finger-twitching.
Baizhu: It's nothing serious, probably just exhaustion from the long journey, then not resting properly afterwards.
Ying'er: It's all my fault...
Baizhu: I'm prescribing a nutritious soup to be taken every night before bed. Here's the recipe. That should sort him out — but if his symptoms persist, make sure to come and see me again.
Ying'er: Thank you, Dr. Baizhu.
Paimon: Looks like Timaeus is gonna be alright. That's a relief.
Timaeus: Ying'er says you helped bring me here. Thank you ever so much.
Traveler: Don't mention it.
Paimon: Ying'er, you should probably get this guy back right away. Baizhu says he needs to rest.
Ying'er: Agreed, plus I shouldn't keep Madame Lan Yan waiting too long. Drop by later when you've got a second, so I can thank you both properly.
Xingqiu: Dr. Baizhu.
Baizhu: Ah, Master Xingqiu... I won't beat around the bush: The situation is looking a little more complicated than I'd initially thought.
Xingqiu: What do you mean?
Baizhu (Changsheng): Baizhu wasn't speaking the whole truth just now. Timaeus's situation is exceptionally strange... and strikingly similar to His Lordship's condition!
Xingqiu: Wait... So Timaeus has the same illness as my great-grandfather?
Baizhu: It would appear so, although it's debatable whether it is an "illness," per se... The truth is, they are both aging at an accelerated rate.
Chongyun: What? Really?
Baizhu: Yes. Significantly faster than the average person. But so far, I have not managed to determine the cause.
Baizhu (Changsheng): Not only does it mystify Baizhu, even I've never witnessed such a malady! Unless, of course, it was so long ago that I have since forgotten.
Baizhu (Changsheng): Timaeus is in the prime of his life, so a little extra exhaustion is nothing dangerous. But His Lordship is so advanced in years already...
Xingqiu: That's terrible... So something is... surreptitiously cutting years off their lives?
Paimon: "Cutting years off their lives"!? What a turn of phrase, that sounds horrible...
Baizhu (Changsheng): *sigh* Baizhu even tried using the secret art on Timaeus earlier, but it was useless. This is a most stubborn disease.
Baizhu: There are a few other remedies I can try, even if it's just trial and error at this point. This morning, I sent Qiqi to Mt. Qingce to look for a certain herb. There's still a chance we might turn things around if we're lucky.
Baizhu: Oh, and speaking of Qingce — has His Lordship been there recently, Master Xingqiu?
Xingqiu: To Qingce Village, you mean?
Baizhu (Changsheng): Yes, we visit there every year during Lantern Rite to run a clinic. But this year, before the clinic had even started, they sent someone all the way here to ask for medical advice. The situation seems urgent.
Baizhu: And then, the patient from Mondstadt who I just saw tells me he stopped off in Qingce Village during his journey... I can't help but wonder if there's some connection.
Xingqiu: If I'm not mistaken, I do believe great-grandfather visited some friends in Qingce Village not too long ago. My father went with him.
Baizhu (Changsheng): Aha. Just as we suspected...
Xingqiu: What is it? I heard the rumors about a god's remains in Qingce... is that what's causing this?
Chongyun: God's remains? Which one?
Xingqiu: Well firstly, I read about this in a book I bought from a street vendor, so it's not the most credible source.
Xingqiu: But the book told of a hidden palace in the Qingce mountain range called the "Hidden Palace of Zhou Formula." It is enchanted with the seven-and-eight-gates method, with which it suppressed countless evil spirits, the most revered of them being a god known as Tao Dou.
Paimon: Wait, so... Tao Dou's remains!? That's what's causing this mystery illness?
Baizhu: Not to steal anyone's thunder, but while I do suspect a connection with Qingce Village, I highly doubt that god remains are the cause.
Baizhu (Changsheng): That's right! The slightest trace of god remains, and Baizhu and I would surely have sensed them.
Paimon: Good point... Then what could be the true cause?
Baizhu: Master Xingqiu, I will head to Qingce Village to investigate further after Qiqi returns. Hopefully, I will have more answers after that.
Traveler: Is there anything I can do to help?
Paimon: Yeah, we're pros at gathering stuff. Just tell us where to go and we'll track down those herbs, no problem.
Baizhu: Hehe, I am most grateful for the offer. I'll be sure to let you know if I need your assistance.
Xingqiu: Thank you for everything, Dr. Baizhu.
Baizhu: Merely doing my duty.
Traveler: Well, you take care of yourself too, Baizhu.
Baizhu: Don't worry about me. I am keenly aware of my limits.
Xingqiu: #Traveler, Paimon, it was good to see you. But now I must return home, and relay Dr. Baizhu's words to my family.
Chongyun: I'll come with you. I wanna take another look at His Lordship's room.
Xingqiu: Very well.
Xingqiu: Bye, everyone. And don't worry about me, I'm doing fine.
Xingqiu: In all honesty, I've never been as close with my great-grandfather as my father and grandfather. Given his age, he already wasn't speaking much by the time I was around.
Paimon: Hey, come on now. We get that you don't want us to worry, but there's no need to downplay it, alright? We should be supporting you here, not the other way around!
Chongyun: Paimon's a lot smarter than I remember... I guess it's been a long time since we last met.
Paimon: Hey! Paimon's always been smart!
Xingqiu: Haha... You know, recently, a phrase that Hu Tao always says has been on my mind a lot: "Live in life, die in death"...
Xingqiu: But she must be exceptionally busy these days, as I've barely seen her at all. So how about we all go for meal together in a few days time, when everything's calmed down?
Traveler: Sounds great. I'm free whenever.
Xingqiu: Then it's decided. See you in a few days.
Paimon: Even though Baizhu ruled out god remains as the cause, Paimon still wants to get to the bottom of this Tao Dou business... It's a shame Keqing had to disappear before she could tell us more.
Traveler: Lan Yan seems quite knowledgeable about it too.
Paimon: True... Then let's head back and ask her. Come on, Xiangling's waiting on us too.

## Talk 7

Ying'er: Ah, you're back. Thanks again for helping me get Timaeus to the doctor — please, take this Mora as a small token of our gratitude.
Traveler: You shouldn't have... I barely lifted a finger.
Timaeus: Well that's gotta be an understatement — I doubt you carried me all the way to Bubu Pharmacy by one finger! Honorary Knight, I can't thank you enough. Please, let us give you something for your efforts.
Paimon: Paimon thinks you're misunderstanding what that phrase means, but okay...
Ying'er: You'll have to excuse him. I think his efforts to learn the local dialect have fried the language part of his brain.
Paimon: Alright, well no more studying for you! Go get some rest, doctor's orders! And if you take a turn for the worse, get back to Bubu Pharmacy right away.
Traveler: By the way, where did Lan Yan go?
Ying'er: Ah yes, I almost forgot to mention — she said she went to catch up with Director Hu. She told me to pass on the message.
Paimon: Wait, so she left?
Hu Tao: Ying'er, I'd like three— Oh! What's this? Is Scent of Spring under new management?
Lan Yan: Haha, perish the thought! Ms. Ying'er had to run an errand, so I'm just watching the shop until she gets back.
Hu Tao: Aha, I see. Well, Miss Temporary-New-Management, could I trouble you for three boxes of Red Dust Under Rolling Clouds?
Lan Yan: Red Dust Under Rolling Clouds... I think that rings a bell. Not a scent the average young lady would choose though.
Hu Tao: Correct. So you probably won't find it on the shelves. More likely hidden in a corner at the back somewhere. Would you mind digging it out?
Lan Yan: Not at all. One moment...
Lan Yan: Here, is this what you're looking for? If I'm not mistaken, it's used exclusively for ritual purposes.
Hu Tao: Oh? A lady of culture, I see... That is not common knowledge.
Lan Yan: Hehe. Let me wrap this up for you.
Hu Tao: Wait, wait! I see it now! You're from the Lan lineage of Chenyu Vale, aren't you?
Lan Yan: Huh? How can you tell?
Hu Tao: Your hairpiece. It's the Jade-Plumed Silverwing, one of the Three Immortals of Tao Dou. Hehe, am I right, or am I right?
Lan Yan: How did... Sorry, who are you?
Hu Tao: Hehehe, let's just say I'm a fellow lady of culture. But alas, I'm in a rush today, so I'll have to say goodbye for now.
Hu Tao: I hope we meet again soon, Miss Temporary-New-Management.
Lan Yan: Huh?
Lan Yan: Grandpa was right, Liyue Harbor is full of hidden talents. I would never have expected the average perfume customer to be so knowledgeable...
Ying'er: Director Hu, I gotta say, that outfit looks really good on you.
Hu Tao: Why thank you, Ms. Ying'er. I was just procuring some perfume from your fine establishment. Your temporary replacement provided a magnificent service.
Ying'er: Haha, that's good to hear.
Lan Yan: Wait... Director Hu?
Ying'er: Hey, we're back. Thanks for watching the store, Madame Lan.
Lan Yan: Ms. Ying'er, that person you spoke to just now... Who was that?
Ying'er: Hu Tao. Director Hu Tao, of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
Lan Yan: Huh? But I thought she wore the funeral parlor uniform with the Harmony Hexagram Hat?
Ying'er: I guess she just changed into something more festive for the festival.
Lan Yan: Shoot... I was face-to-face with her, and I had no idea...
Lan Yan: Sorry, Ms. Ying'er, something's come up. Please let the others know I had to leave.
Ying'er: Huh? What could possibly be so urgent...?
Paimon: And then she just ran off after Hu Tao? Weird...
Traveler: Maybe she'll be at the funeral parlor.
Ying'er: Are you going to look for her? If so, could you take this with you? I just found it in the store.
Paimon: Huh? Wait... isn't this one of those rattan figures?
Ying'er: Whatever it is, we don't sell them. So I'm guessing Madame Lan left it here by accident.
Paimon: Yeah, well she definitely makes these. Although, this one's pretty different from the ones she made for the street fair. Plus, it has a sigil on it for some reason...
Ying'er: Not the kind of thing you see every day, that's for sure. It could be important, so if it does belong to Madame Lan, I'd like to get it back to her as soon as possible.
Paimon: Then let's head to Wangsheng Funeral Parlor again. Whatever it's for, the sooner she gets it back, the better.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Hey, Miss Undertaker. Are Hu Tao and Madame Lan back yet?
Ferrylady: Sorry, I'm afraid not.
Paimon: Really? How strange. They were definitely heading this way... Maybe Hu Tao had another appointment. Any idea where we might find them?
Ferrylady: If it was anything business-related, I expect the director would have let me know. I was aware she had a meeting earlier today, for instance. But she doesn't keep me informed about her private affairs.
Traveler: So you're saying, Hu Tao is dealing with a private matter?
Ferrylady: It's possible. The director seems to have had a lot on her mind lately. In the past, she'd usually show up to work in the mid-morning, but recently she's been getting here before the sun's up. She said she's had trouble sleeping, and has been dreaming more than usual.
Paimon: Trouble sleeping? ...Are we talking about the same Hu Tao here? That doesn't sound like her at all...
Ferrylady: You might want to talk to our consultant, Zhongli. He's closer to her than I am.
Paimon: Oh, good idea! How did we not think of that... So where can we find him? Probably sipping tea somewhere, right?
Ferrylady: Hehe. He's just across the road on the second floor, watching an opera. If you listen carefully, you might be able to hear it...
Observe (Voice From Afar): Through discordant tones and tragic fates...
Paimon: Oh yeah! Paimon hears singing!
Paimon: Seems like Zhongli is the only one taking it easy today. Let's go say hi.

## Talk 9

Baizhu: Something else I can help you with?
Traveler: About the god remains in Mt. Qingce...
Baizhu (Changsheng): Still musing about that, hmm... I suppose you're remembering the events with Jiangli and Jialiang from last time? It did cross our minds as well.
Baizhu (Changsheng): At the time, we assumed the god remains in question were the chi blood, but hearing what Master Xingqiu had to say has us second guessing ourselves. Perhaps it wasn't the chi after all, but Tao Dou...
Baizhu: Either way, there's no trace of any god remains on His Lordship or Timaeus. There has to be another explanation for their symptoms.
Baizhu (Changsheng): Yes. We'll just have to wait until Qiqi comes back.

### Additional Talk 1

Hu Tao: Go get yourselves to the fair. I'll join you as soon as I can.

### Additional Talk 2

Chef Mao: What's on the menu, Xiangling?
Xiangling: I'm thinking, my latest creation! You know the one: Drunken Plums in Snow!

### Additional Talk 3

Yun Jin: ...Swallows will return for a new nest!
Zhongli: Remarkable, Ms. Yun. You have breathed fresh life into an old classic and, I daresay, surpassed the original.
Yun Jin: You flatter me, Mr. Zhongli. I'm just glad my voice held out — I'm a little out of practice...
Tea Master Liu Su: Nonsense, Sir Yun! You were as stunning as ever. And if that was you out of practice, well! The official Lantern Rite performance is sure to be truly sensational.
Paimon: Hey Zhongli, hey Yun Jin! How's it going?
Yun Jin: #Wow, Traveler and Paimon! What a lovely surprise!
Zhongli: It's been too long, old friends. Are you here for the opera?
Tea Master Liu Su: Oh dear, what a pity. I'm afraid you just missed today's performance... and Ms. Yun needs to rest her voice now, or she'll strain it.
Yun Jin: Hehe, it's okay, Tea Master Liu — these two are good friends of mine. If they'd like to hear me sing, a few more minutes won't do me any harm.
Paimon: Aw, thanks Yun Jin! But hopefully you don't think we came here just to show up late and demand a private performance...
Yun Jin: Oh, of course not, heh... I'm guessing you're here for Mr. Zhongli, then?
Zhongli: Oh? And how might I be of assistance?
Paimon: Okay, so... A friend of ours left something behind at a shop, we're trying to return it to her, and all we know is she's probably with Hu Tao. Any idea where Hu Tao might be?
Zhongli: The Director is a free spirit who roams far and wide. She could be most anywhere.
Paimon: Oh, great... Well this is just fantastic...
Yun Jin: Is it something important? The thing she left behind, I mean.
Paimon: That's the thing — we don't know what it's for. But we wanna get it back to her as soon as possible, just in case she really needs it.
Traveler: (Show the rattan figure)
Tea Master Liu Su: Oh, goodness! THAT'S what you're trying to get back to her? But isn't that... a Pentad Rattan!?
Yun Jin: Pentad Rattan...? So you recognize this?
Tea Master Liu Su: Haven't you heard? The word on the street is that the patriarch of the Feiyun Commerce Guild has fallen gravely ill. They say his family found an ominous-looking rattan figure in his bedroom... and there was a Pentad Fortune Conveyance talisman on it.
Tea Master Liu Su: That cursed thing must have been put there to steal his good fortune... it's destroying his health, wealth, and every other good thing in his life!
Tea Master Liu Su: And based on the description, your rattan figure looks suspiciously similar. It could even be the same one that... Ugh, get it away from me, I don't want that thing anywhere near me!
Paimon: Relax, it's fine! This one definitely belongs to Madame Lan. Besides, we've had it on us this whole time, and nothing bad's happened to us yet!
Yun Jin: Madame Lan? You mean, from the Chenyu Vale Artisans Association?
Tea Master Liu Su: Oh, now that would explain a lot! The Lans of Chenyu Vale practice Qimen magic... This Pentad Fortune Conveyance business would be right up their alley!
Tea Master Liu Su: This leaves only one question unanswered. Namely... Why would the Lans of Chenyu Vale have a bone to pick with the Feiyun Commerce Guild?
Paimon: ...Uh, what? Will you listen to yourself? You can't seriously believe all that. You'd sooner convince Paimon that Rex Lapis was a slime...
Zhongli: Heh, the latter is certainly the more compelling theory. Master Liu, you appear to have been misinformed by these rumors, and also failed to notice the Guyan Sigil on this particular rattan figure.
Tea Master Liu Su: Oh? Please enlighten me, Mr. Zhongli.
Zhongli: This is the Sign of Vaisravana, one of the four main exorcism sigils. A most upstanding and auspicious sign, by no means cursed.
Zhongli: As a matter of fact, a series of Fortune Coins bearing the exorcism sigils recently entered circulation in Liyue Harbor. I am somewhat surprised that you didn't recognize it, Master Liu.
Tea Master Liu Su: Oh! ...Yes, yes, of course, I remember now. Thank you for jogging my memory, Mr. Zhongli! I am humbled by your superior erudition.
Paimon: This makes way more sense than Madame Lan going around trying to curse people to death.
Yun Jin: I guess the rattan figure they found in His Lordship's room must have been put there by someone in his family to bring good luck.
Paimon: In that case, there's a good chance Madame Lan also purposely left this behind to keep Timaeus safe and well.
Zhongli: In all likelihood, yes.
Paimon: Phew! Guess we don't need to find her so urgently after all. We were just worried that losing this might've ruined her plans.
Paimon: But that said... What did she need Hu Tao for, anyway? And what is Hu Tao up to that's keeping her so busy? Paimon has a bad feeling about it for some reason...
Traveler: Any ideas, Zhongli?
Zhongli: The director's mind is a labyrinth I could not hope to comprehend. She probably has more things she has to think about than the rest of us combined.
Paimon: Are any of those thoughts the kind that might keep someone up at night?
Zhongli: She has never mentioned that.
Zhongli: But as the director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, she has a solemn duty to balance the forces of life and death in Liyue. I would be surprised, and even a little unsettled, if she were truly as carefree as she appears.
Yun Jin: I agree. I've known Hu Tao for a while now, and for all her eccentricities, she takes pride in what she does. As her friends, we should just be there for her when she needs us.
Zhongli: Indeed. The director's competence is the only reason I can afford to sit here enjoying a fine cup of tea and listening to the opera.
Paimon: Uh... having a competent boss isn't an excuse to slack off, you know!
Yun Jin: Haha, I think Mr. Zhongli just means you should have faith in Hu Tao. There's no need to worry about her so much.
Paimon: Fair point... Heh, somehow, seeing how calm Zhongli is about the whole thing does make Paimon feel much more at ease.
Zhongli: You two ought to be out enjoying the festivities. The Lantern Rite only comes once a year, so make the most of it.
Zhongli: ...If you're still worried, take this.
Traveler: What is it?
Zhongli: A Fortune Coin. It has recently become customary to give them as gifts, so in the spirit of the season, this is my gift to you.
Paimon: Wow! Zhongli actually left the house with cash!? Now THIS is a Lantern Rite to remember!
Tea Master Liu Su: Goodness gracious! Mr. Zhongli, that looks like a very special coin you have there! Is that... one of the fabled Rex Coins!?
Paimon: ..."Rex Coin"!?
Tea Master Liu Su: Yes, look at the design on the face — it's quite different from the typical coins you see in circulation. It appears to be a symbol of Rex Lapis... There's no doubt about it: This is a Rex Coin, which means it once passed through the hands of the Lord of Geo himself!
Zhongli: This is simply a curio I picked up from a street vendor, Master Liu. Almost certainly a replica. But I can introduce you to the vendor if you are interested.
Tea Master Liu Su: Oh... So it's just a souvenir, then? I assumed it was a family heirloom of great value.
Zhongli: #Haha. Traveler, please take this. May it bring you comfort when your mind is troubled.
Paimon: Huh? So it's an anti-anxiety coin? How is that supposed to work?
Tea Master Liu Su: Aha, well, even if the coin itself is a replica, the symbol of Rex Lapis is still genuine. And if the symbol is real, so are its effects! So long as you have this coin, Rex Lapis will always be with you.
Tea Master Liu Su: Mr. Zhongli, would you mind showing me to the vendor from whom you acquired this coin? I wouldn't mind procuring a little of the Lord of Geo's good fortune for myself.
Zhongli: Very well. The walk will do me good. Friends, may we meet again soon.

### Additional Talk 4

Ying'er: You are gonna concentrate on resting and recovering for the next few days, you hear?
Timaeus: Yes, Ma'am! What the lady wants, the lady gets.
Ying'er: Hehe, now there's a turn of phrase I could get used to.

### Additional Talk 5

Yun Jin: By the way, I'll be performing The Sanctification of Tao Dou on the day of the Lantern Rite. That's the one I was just practicing earlier. It's only a few days away now... I'd be honored if you could come and support me.
Paimon: Oh, that's what you were singing just now? Paimon definitely wants to hear the full thing. We'll be there!
Paimon: We were actually learning about the Eight Adepts earlier, but we never found out who the Three Beasts of Tao Dou were.
Yun Jin: Oh really? Well for starters, the Three Beasts of Tao Dou are also known as the Three Immortals of Tao Dou.
Yun Jin: They were the Lone Butterfly of the Crimson Flame, the Jade-Plumed Silverwing, and the Gold-Eyed Celadon Mare. Three auspicious beasts, all with the power to take on human form.
Paimon: Oh! So they really weren't human, huh... Um, the Lone Butterfly sounds pretty self-explanatory, but what about the silverwing and celadon mare? What kind of creatures were they?
Yun Jin: Silverwing was a swallow, and the Celadon Mare was a white horse. Legend holds that after purifying Tao Dou, Silverwing and Wind Reader went wandering together, but the white horse retreated into seclusion.
Yun Jin: Have you ever read Moonlit Bamboo Forest? That story mentions a white horse that roamed the Qingce mountain range. A lot of people think she was the Gold-Eyed Celadon Mare.
Paimon: Oh, cool! So... what about the butterfly? What did they get up to?
Yun Jin: The Lone Butterfly gave her life during the purification spell... She was the only one of the eight to sacrifice herself in this way.
Yun Jin: Even though the eight had remarkable powers, purifying a god of Tao Dou's caliber was no mean feat. They had to resort to a secret art called the Seven-and-Eight-Gates Array.
Yun Jin: The method involves obfuscating one of the gates so that evil can't escape. The Lone Butterfly was in charge of the gate that was chosen to be obfuscated, and so she disappeared from the world in the process.
Paimon: Aw... That's so tragic...
Yun Jin: But all was not lost. According to the legend, Old Man Wuwang, another one of the eight who looked up to her a lot, took up her mantle and kept her legacy alive.
Paimon: Interesting... And then he taught that to the founders of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, right? Didn't they train under him?
Yun Jin: Exactly. That's where it feels like fate came into play. After giving her life to restore order to the realm of the dead, some chance meetings ensured that future generations continued using her methods to guard the border between life and death.
Yun Jin: So although she herself disappeared from the world, her mission to protect Liyue is still alive and well, thousands of years on. Anyway, that's basically the whole story of how the Eight Adepts purified Tao Dou.
Paimon: Now we finally have names for the full roster. Thanks, Yun Jin!
Yun Jin: My pleasure. I haven't performed this opera in a long, long time, so I still have a fair bit of brushing up to do before I'm ready.
Traveler: Don't practice too much, or you'll tire your voice out.
Yun Jin: Heh, thanks, I appreciate it. See you around.
Xiangling: Hey guys! Are you finally done? I've been waiting forever!
Paimon: Huh? Oh, Xiangling! What are you doing here?
Xiangling: Tracking you guys down, obviously! You really made me work for it, too.
Xiangling: It's honestly a little rich that you're out here telling everyone else to take care of themselves and keep a good work-life balance when you are apparently too busy to eat!
Xiangling: Keep this up, and I'll have to drag you to the dinner table and force feed you my delicious cooking against your will!
Xiangling: Here we are, I present to you Chef Xiangling's newest creation: Drunken Plums in Snow. You must be starving, surely? Go on, dig in!
Paimon: Wow! This is so nice of you, Xiangling. Paimon hadn't noticed how hungry she had gotten, but smelling that food is making Paimon ravenous!
Xiangling: #Sounds like you have a tough life, hey Paimon? Sometimes you feast, but sometimes Traveler lets you go hungry. You should ditch Traveler and hang with me from now on — you'll never go hungry again.
Paimon: Ooh! Now that is a tempting offer!
Traveler: At least I've never charged you for a single meal.
Paimon: That may be true, but you also pretty much never feed Paimon on time!
Xiangling: Haha, I was only kidding. I know Paimon loves to eat, but I think it'd take more than food to pry her away from your side.
Xiangling: Anyway, enough about that — time for you guys to eat. Whatever your plans are after this, they'll go much better on a full stomach!
Traveler: Enjoy watching her eat your whole business into oblivion...
Paimon: Oh come on, it's only one extra customer!

### Additional Talk 6

Tea Master Liu Su: So, Mr. Zhongli, where exactly is this vendor's stall?
Zhongli: Gone, it seems. Perhaps they sold all their stock and moved on.
Tea Master Liu Su: ...You're not making this all up, are you?
Zhongli: I wouldn't dream of it.
