# Talk Dialog

Amber: I've had times when I wished that one day, I'd wake up to find Baron Bunny had come to life and could talk.
Amber: Y'know, like Oz, Fischl's raven. They get to go adventuring together, and can even split up on missions when they need to.
Amber: Still, Baron Bunny's already a huge help. Besides, if I want to become the best outrider ever, it's me I gotta focus on!
