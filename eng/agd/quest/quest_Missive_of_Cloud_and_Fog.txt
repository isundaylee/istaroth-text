# Missive of Cloud and Fog


## Talk 1

Paimon: Venti might be here already, let's take a look inside!
Athos: Halt! Citizens, what noble errand brings you?
Paimon: Is Kaeya here? We need him for something.
Athos: Captain Kaeya? He's on duty in Jean's office.
Paimon: Eh? Why is he in Jean's office?
Athos: The Windblume Festival celebrations have always been hosted by the Knights of Favonius. During the festivities, Master Jean personally goes out on patrol.
Athos: Captain Kaeya takes over her administrative duties during that period.
Paimon: Huh, is that right...

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hiya!
Venti: Traveler, Paimon, you're here!
Kaeya: I was just thinking about you two, and now here you are. How fortuitous!
Paimon: Kaeya, did you do your homework?
Kaeya: I'm afraid I must disappoint you... I haven't even started writing it yet.
Venti: Hmm, students that don't hand in their homework on time aren't exactly model students now, are they?
Paimon: And what excuse does Kaeya have for not handing in his homework?
Kaeya: Well, as you can see, I'm helping Master Jean take care of various matters.
Kaeya: Mondstadt is a hive of activity over the festive period. Accordingly, there's a multitude of things that need sorting. *sigh* I've been at it for a good while now.
Kaeya: Traveler... can I ask for a favor?
Kaeya: I have a drinking buddy that wants me to help him with something, but I'm much too busy. Can I entrust this matter to you?
Venti: A drinking buddy? A friend you met at the tavern?
Kaeya: That's right. I often go to the tavern when not on duty. Somehow, I seem to have made quite a few acquaintances that way.
Kaeya: His name is Nimrod, he's never far from the tavern. He should be free right now.
Kaeya: Thanks for the help. I'd better stay behind and get started on my homework.
Traveler: Good luck, Kaeya.
Traveler: I'll consider it part of my Windblume experience.

## Talk 3

Nimrod: *sigh* What should I do...
Paimon: You must be Nimrod! Kaeya mentioned there was something you wanted him to take care of. He's busy right now, but we can help.
Nimrod: ...Huh? Oh, Traveler... I didn't realize it was you.
Nimrod: ...It's like this: I'm planning to give a gift to my wife for the Windblume Festival, and I wanted my drinking buddy, Kaeya, to come up with a gift idea.
Nimrod: ...I—I'm afraid I'm a bit of a drunkard, I'm nearly always in the tavern. My wife hates me drinking, so we're constantly arguing.
Paimon: Another day, another drunkard...
Venti: I can empathize, I don't mind a drink or two myself! Then again, and I'm not one to judge, but by the looks of your drinking habits... hmm...
Nimrod: I know... She's right, of course. I feel like I have to make it up to her.
Nimrod: ...Traveler, can you help me gather some materials? I want to make a gift for her myself.
Nimrod: ...I should have made preparations in advance, but I've barely been sober these last few days. I fell asleep, and when I woke up the celebrations had already begun! Now I'll never have time to finish it by myself...
Paimon: Yeesh, this guy is a mess...
Venti: ...Single folks in Mondstadt would never dare get others to help them during the festive period. It's lucky you're already married, Nimrod.
Nimrod: Uh-huh... you're telling me... *sigh* I'm sorry... Here I am making a fool of myself in front of all of you.
Paimon: *sigh* What's done is done. Spit it out then, how can we help?
Nimrod: I'm going to look for wood in the city, and we'll need plants to place inside. Those only grow in the wild, could I ask you to retrieve them? I need two stems of Small Lamp Grass.
Paimon: Small Lamp Grass and wood... what are you making, exactly?
Nimrod: I want to make her a little wooden house, with glowing flowers and handmade furniture inside...
Venti: Aww, such a thoughtful gift!
Nimrod: A token of my love, haha. ...Back when I'd only just gotten to know her, I used to make handmade gifts for her all the time... She loved them, she even used to say that...
Nimrod: Oh! Uh — ahem, excuse me. Let's put the past aside for the moment. Thank you all for your help.
Paimon: Lucky you came across such kind-hearted assistants, hmm?
Paimon: Alright, let's go and find those materials!

## Talk 4

Nimrod: ...I haven't done any carpentry for a long time now. I hope everything goes to plan!

## Talk 5

Nimrod: ...Thank you, thank you so much! With these materials, I can get to work straight away.
Paimon: Remember, a gift can't solve everything! You need to start being fair to your wife, too!
Nimrod: I will, I will!
Nimrod: *sigh* I do hope she likes my gift, though...
Venti: Everyone likes a gift given with love, don't worry.
Paimon: Make it a good one! Don't go wasting those materials, they weren't easy to find y'know!

## Talk 6

Paimon: We're back! Kaeya, have you finished?
Venti: Time to hand in your homework!
Kaeya: Welcome back, I'm just finishing up.
Paimon: Go, go, go, hand it in, hand it in!
Kaeya: Alright, alright... Now then, no hurting my feelings.
Venti: Hmm... Mm? Ooooh...
Paimon: Tone-Deaf Bard, what grade did he get?
Venti: Kaeya, may I read this out loud?
Kaeya: Feel free.
Venti: *clears throat*
Venti: "Mi muhe ye
Means I love you
In the language of the hilichurls."
Paimon: Eh? Ehh!?
Venti: That's it.
Paimon: That's it!?
Kaeya: Coherent and to the point. Plus, the length seems about right.
Paimon: What!? Are you writing a Hilichurlian phrase book!?
Traveler: Ridiculous. Where's the romance?
Kaeya: Hahaha, a love poem has to convey the style of its author, you know?
Venti: I'm not sure you took the exercise seriously.
Paimon: Wait... so we're just gonna gloss over the fact that Kaeya can speak Hilichurlian? Weird.
Kaeya: Haha, don't underestimate the hidden knowledge of the Knights of Favonius' Cavalry Captain!
Venti: Alright then, time to collect the next student's homework...
Kaeya: ...!
Kaeya: I just caught sight of a suspicious figure, I must go and investigate. Traveler, I have another small task for you.
Kaeya: The Church has applied to us for a hunting license. Please take these official documents to the Cathedral.
Paimon: *sigh* Running errands again...!
Traveler: Nice work, you learned a lot, I see.

## Talk 7

Jean: Lisa, we need to establish some ground rules... If we do end up apprehending any drunken troublemakers, no electrocutions. Okay?
Lisa: Oh Jean, you misunderstand me. That intoxicated fellow you witnessed last time was practically begging me to be shocked. It makes me wonder if some people don't actually quite enjoy getting—
Jean: Lisa!
Lisa: *sigh* Very well then, if you insist.
Paimon: Jean, Lisa!
Venti: Greetings, ladies! It's been a while.
Traveler: What are you two doing here?
Jean: A while indeed. As you can see, Lisa and I are on duty.
Lisa: Aww, it's cutie and friends. Did you see any suspicious people on the way here? If you do see anything, report straight to the Knights.
Paimon: Since when do librarians go out on patrol?
Lisa: Rarely, but this is the Windblume Festival, and they need all hands on deck. Even the humble clerical staff, like me.
Jean: Lisa, "humble clerical staff" do not wield Electro the way you do.
Jean: *sigh* Please do not be alarmed, I will keep my eyes on Lisa. Especially since she seems to enjoy electrocuting people just to break up a scuffle. Not to mention shocking drunkards until they beg for mercy...
Lisa: If you don't like it, I can happily refrain.
Jean: Is that a promise? Good. Otherwise, I'm going to have to reconsider whether I want a librarian on patrol with me.
Paimon: Paimon never knew being on patrol could be so exciting!

## Talk 8

Paimon: Barbara, Kaeya sent us to deliver the—
Bennett: How dare they! This is sheer intimidation!
Barbara: How could somebody do this...
Paimon: Huh!?
Venti: What's happened?
Barbara: I... *sniff* I—I received a letter... *sniff* It says... I—It says...
Bennett: Let me. I just came back from the wilderness. As usual, I came by the Cathedral to ask the sisters to patch me up. That's when I saw Barbara running out, white as a sheet. She was holding a letter.
Barbara: I've never received a letter like this before...
Venti: Can I take a look?
Venti: Hm... "Dear Barbara, I've stolen the thing most precious to you and buried it." Huh... Could this be an attempt at intimidation?
Bennett: It's awful... is it a joke? If so, we don't need to worry. But...
Barbara: ...But... what if it's real...?
Paimon: There's a map on the back, isn't that out in the wilderness?
Bennett: Hmm... the thing most precious to you...
Venti: Hm, buried...
Bennett: Huh... that location on the map is familiar, I've definitely been there before.
Traveler: So what is the thing most precious to you?
Barbara: I can't think straight right now, nothing makes sense... *whimpers*
Bennett: It's coming to me... It's coming to me...
Barbara: The thing most precious to me... W—Wait, could it be? Oh no!
Paimon: Barbara! Hey! Slow down!
Bennett: Aha! I've got it! The Thousand Winds Temple!
Venti: Bennett — hey!
Paimon: Why are they in such a hurry? Let's catch up with them!

## Talk 9

Barbara: ...My sister!
Rosaria: Slow down.
Barbara: Rosaria! I just—
Rosaria: Calm down.
Rosaria: I ran into Jean a moment ago, Lisa was with her. She's fine.
Barbara: *gasp* R—Really? A—Are you sure?
Barbara: Whew...
Rosaria: ...
Rosaria: That letter. Give it to me.
Venti: Sure...
Barbara: ...If they're not talking about Jean in the letter... then what are they talking about?
Paimon: Did you really think they'd buried Jean underground!? What a horrible thought!
Venti: So, Sister, have you found any leads?
Rosaria: Looking at the map, the perpetrator seems to have marked out an area around Dawn Winery.
Rosaria: That's open land, so hiding something there... Hmm, what could it be?
Paimon: Nice work! How did you figure that out so quickly?
Paimon: Although... Dawn Winery? That's not the place we were thinking...
Barbara: ...
Rosaria: Barbara, rather than letting your imagination get the better of you, stand up and face this head-on.
Barbara: ...You're right, it's just...
Venti: Hehe, it's a little scary, right? That's why we're going with you. What do you say?
Barbara: Uh? Th—That's very kind...
Venti: And you, Sister? Will you be accompanying us?
Rosaria: No need... I knew straight away there was nothing to worry about.
Paimon: Eh? And what does that mean?
Rosaria: ...Nothing. Get going, then.
Venti: Barbara, are you feeling a bit better now?
Barbara: Mm-hmm! I'm... I'm okay.
Barbara: Rosaria is right, better to know the ways of the enemy than stand here scaring myself.
Paimon: That's right! Let's get moving!
Barbara: Thank you, all of you. Let's get to the location and see what we find.
Paimon: Yup, yup! Go, Barbara, go!

## Talk 10

Paimon: What is this? Hmm... quick, let's open it!
Barbara: I... I...
Venti: ...Interesting... such an exquisite gift box. What's it doing out here in the wilderness?
Barbara: ...Huh!?
Paimon: Wow, what a beautiful Windwheel Aster wreath! And so many paper stars!
Traveler: Is this a prank?
Venti: Hmm... looks like our "perpetrator" is really just one of Barbara's fans.
Paimon: There's a note! What does it say? Hmm, let's see...
Paimon: "So sorry to get your attention this way. Please accept this Windblume as a sign of my sincere admiration for your virtue and sweetness."
Paimon: Huh? So it's... fraudulent intimidation, then?
Venti: Be it for the gods or that special someone, flowers should be offered in utmost sincerity. It's the most important ceremony of the Windblume Festival.
Venti: Flowers of love and blessings, sent on such a special occasion... No effort should be spared to make it spectacular.
Venti: Behind the questionable methodology... here we have a meticulously thought-out and heartfelt gift.
Paimon: Heh... laying it on a little thick, aren't we...? Still seems like someone with a few screws loose to Paimon...
Venti: Hahaha, maybe you're right. I think I have a suspect in mind who fits that description...
Paimon: Who? Who?
Traveler: (I think I know the answer too.)
Venti: Shh! No telling, now... I'd like Paimon to make a few guesses.
Paimon: Ah!? You're so annoying!
Traveler: Is this just someone's way of getting your attention?
