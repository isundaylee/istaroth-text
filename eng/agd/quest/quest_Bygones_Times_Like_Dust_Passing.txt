# Bygones Times Like Dust Passing


## Talk 1

Siqin: We're halfway there. I must keep my wits about me and continue to ensure the safety of the site for the remainder of the project!

## Talk 2

Siqin: We're halfway there. I must keep my wits about me and continue to ensure the safety of the site for the remainder of the project!

## Talk 3

Paimon: By the way, what question are you gonna ask Ningguang, Yun Jin?
Yun Jin: I'm looking for a venue to host the performance of our new opera. Ningguang has excellent judgment, so I would like to hear her opinion.
Paimon: Whoa... What's the opera called? Paimon wants to go see it!
Yun Jin: The opera is a labor of love by my father. He wrote it's a story about an evil spirit and an adeptus.
Yun Jin: It's called "The Divine Damsel of Devastation."

## Talk 4

Paimon: This should be enough Starsplinter Iron. Now we just need to find that "Subrosium"...
Yun Jin: I think I saw a village on our way here.
Yun Jin: Master Zhang said we should ask the locals for help. Why don't we try there?

## Talk 5

Leming: The next step is to build the pavilions on the upper layer while we wait for the Wonder Cores and the Adepti Sigils.

## Talk 6

Lizheng: The basic structure is beginning to take shape, but there is still a lot of work to do... Get back to it.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Hmm, we've looked everywhere but still no mention of Subrosium.
Paimon: Let's have a look over there!

## Talk 8

Paimon: That's everything we need! Let's head back and report in!
Paimon: Paimon's curious if Beidou's made any progress...

## Talk 9

Shenhe: The zombie called Qiqi is right. A great wrath brews in the sea.
Shenhe: I don't know where this wrath comes from. So let's keep our distance for the time being.

## Talk 10

Shenhe: I came back here once before, a few years ago. Alone. I hid it from Master at the time.
Shenhe: It was deserted then, too, except for a few low-life bandits. Everyone and everything I remembered was long gone. But as people were passing by, they stopped to admire me... they praised me, telling me I gave off the aura of an adeptus.
Shenhe: I tried explaining to them that I wasn't an adeptus, just an ordinary person who came from this village. But no one believed me.
Shenhe: When I saw how run-down all these houses were, I felt at a loss. It was like I took a look at the world and, on the surface, it looked like a vast realm with so many places I could go. Then I looked a little closer. And there was nowhere for me to go at all.
Mingjun: Suddenly, so much time has gone by, and everything has changed.
Shenhe: Last time I visited, I felt so upset. But today... I don't know why, but it feels different.
Mingjun: It is easy for your mind to run wild when you are alone. But this time, you are with your friends, aren't you?
Shenhe: Yes, my... my friends.

## Talk 11

Changfeng: The Jade Chamber belongs in the sky amongst the clouds!

Anshun: I heard that Lady Keqing has gone to Guyun Stone Forest.

## Talk 15

Leming: The next step is to build the pavilions on the upper layer while we wait for the Wonder Cores and the Adepti Sigils.

## Talk 16

Paimon: This is it!
Paimon: So basically, we need to go to the *middle of the lake* south of Mt. Tianheng at *dusk*, and we'll find us some Subrosium.
Paimon: Let's go back and tell Shenhe the news.

## Talk 17

Liang: I heard a good few of my comrades have been sent over to Guyun Stone Forest. I sure hope they'll be safe out there...

## Talk 18

Liang: I heard a good few of my comrades have been sent over to Guyun Stone Forest. I sure hope they'll be safe out there...

## Talk 19

Changfeng: The Jade Chamber looks magnificent...

## Talk 20

Anshun: The fact we were able to complete the construction work on schedule is a testament to everyone's hard work.

## Talk 21

Leming: The construction work on the Jade Chamber is now complete. Once we install the Wonder Cores and the Adepti Sigils, we can let it rise to altitude.

## Talk 22

Mingjun: One year when I was back visiting, I heard a story about a white-haired adeptus from a merchant passing by. I never imagined it was you.
Mingjun: I was a very close friend of your father's. I could have stopped him from performing the summoning ritual — I had plenty of chances, but... I couldn't bring myself to stand up to him. I just let things happen, let it all escalate, and... Well, we all know how that story ended.
Mingjun: I bring flowers back here every year, and each time I wish I had a chance to apologize to you.
Shenhe: Apologize for what? If you'd stopped him, he'd only have found another way.
Shenhe: There is nothing he wouldn't have done for his true love. Nothing.
Mingjun: Do you still... hate him?
Shenhe: I don't know what I feel. I'm told my fate is to bear the curse of calamity, so my master bound my soul with red ropes to curb my aggression. But it also dampened my emotions, making me dispassionate like the adepti.
Shenhe: So if you ask me how I feel about the past, if I hate my father or not... The truth is, I feel nothing at all.
Mingjun: It must have been so tough for you all these years...
Paimon: Shenhe, we're back!
Mingjun: Oh, then I will leave you all in peace. Shenhe, it brings me some solace knowing that you are okay.
Mingjun: I'll tell you more about the old times next time we meet.
Paimon: Thanks, mister! We found some info in the end!
Paimon: Shenhe, look! This tells us how to find Subrosium. All we gotta do is go to the middle of that lake!
Shenhe: Hm? Let's go then.
Yun Jin: ...
Yun Jin: Ms. Shenhe, there's something I'd like to talk to you about.
Yun Jin: Just now, in the village, we found your father's diary... It turns out that many of the details in "The Divine Damsel of Devastation" are not true to the facts. So I'd like to change them.
Shenhe: Why?
Yun Jin: I know I say that opera always deviates from the truth, but now that the main character is standing right here in front of me, I cannot simply dismiss your lived experience in favor of my father's fiction.
Shenhe: It's okay. I like your version.
Yun Jin: Huh?
Shenhe: My master once said that the day I learn how to use my strength for the good of others is the day that I can truly become part of human society.
Shenhe: So I hope that one day, I might be brave enough to stand up and protect others, just like the girl in the opera.
Shenhe: But I've never thought this way before and I wonder whether I will continue to think in this way.
Yun Jin: Don't worry. I believe you will.
Yun Jin: In fact, I think maybe you've already started to become the person you aspire to be. You just haven't had the opportunity to see it for yourself yet.
Paimon: Shenhe, Yun Jin, cut the chit-chat! Let's go!
Paimon: We can't let someone else beat us to it!

## Talk 23

Yun Jin: So it seems that Shenhe's father thought he was summoning a benevolent deity using a magic incantation, but in fact he summoned an evil god's remains, which took the form of a monster.
Yun Jin: His obsessive yearning for his deceased wife led to a terrible tragedy, the villagers moved away in fear without ever learning the truth... and now this place is deserted.
Yun Jin: Still, I do wonder what the connection is between Shenhe and Mingjun.

## Talk 24

Master Zhang: Goodness...
Paimon: S—So, are they okay?
Master Zhang: This is some top-quality ore you've found. I think I'll get a good end product out of these.
Master Zhang: Guess now it's my time to shine...
Beidou: Hey everyone. How's the A-Team doing?
Beidou: I ran into a bit of a brick wall on my end. Suling's never seen a Wonder Core before, and says it'd take a lot of research for him to get up to speed...
Master Zhang: Leave the Wonder Cores to me. I'll work on them while you go about your business.
Master Zhang: Don't worry, it won't take me too long.
Yun Jin: Much obliged, Master Zhang. We should look into the Adepti Sigils next, but where should we find items relating to the adepti?
Shenhe: I'll sort that out.
Beidou: Oh? You got this then?
Shenhe: Yes. I have been training with the adepti for years. I know a thing or two about making sigils.
Shenhe: When we first met, I told you I came for the Jade Chamber, not the contest.
Shenhe: In fact, I came specifically to deliver Adepti Sigils. Master heard that Ningguang was planning to rebuild the Jade Chamber, so she sent me to deliver some Adepti Sigils to her.
Shenhe: Master also said she hoped that I can take this opportunity to rejoin human society. But now that I'm here, I wonder if I've been removed from the world for too long. There's so much basic knowledge that I lack.
Shenhe: Maybe it won't work for me to stay here after all. But either way, I'm very glad to have met you, and I'll take care of those Adepti Sigils.
Beidou: Without knowing the ins and outs of your situation, I can't say whether you should stay or not.
Beidou: But now that our paths have crossed, we'll always have a connection. So if you're ever feeling down, come find me on my ship. There'll be a drink waiting for ya.
Shenhe: Thank you.
Shenhe: So... Master Zhang, I'll need to use your facilities to make the sigils.
Master Zhang: Fine by me, I'm actually curious to see how the adepti arts work. Maybe I'll learn something.
Black Screen Text: Master Zhang and Shenhe start making the Wonder Cores and the Adepti Sigils.
Shenhe: Phew...
Shenhe: The sigils are ready. Though they are in some respects inferior to my master's, I can assure you there will be no quality issues.
Master Zhang: I've finished forging the things you asked for too.
Paimon: Great! Let's go submit them before someone else gets there ahead of us!

## Talk 25

Yun Jin: I came to Mt. Tianheng once with my father as a child. I remember it being such a long climb that I could barely feel my legs by the time we reached the top.
Yun Jin: This is quite a trip down memory lane for me... Look at these majestic towering peaks and the gently flowing streams. It's like setting foot in paradise.
Yun Jin: No wonder the legend of "The Divine Damsel of Devastation" is said to have taken place here. "Adepti wander oft where mortals seldom stride." Indeed, this looks like a place that one might expect to be frequented by adepti.
Paimon: "The Divine Damsel of Devastation" is your upcoming opera, right? And the story takes place in Mt. Tianheng, huh... Seems like you have a real connection with this place!
Paimon: What's the story about, though?
Yun Jin: It's... the story of a girl becoming a hero.
Paimon: Cool, a hero story! They're Paimon's favorite!
Yun Jin: The legend first arose in this area. It is said that there used to be a prosperous village on the mountain.
Yun Jin: In that village, there was a loving couple who were completely devoted to one another. One day, a terrifying monster appeared.
Yun Jin: The wife was out collecting herbs and was captured by the monster. Her husband was so distraught at the news that it broke his spirit, and drove him to madness.
Yun Jin: The vile and vicious monster told the villagers, "If you want to live, you must sacrifice a child to me!"
Paimon: What a nasty piece of work! Ugh! Paimon sure hopes this monster gets put in its place!
Yun Jin: But the monster was so terrible and so strong that all within the village were terrified of it. They had no choice but to give in to the monster's demand.
Yun Jin: Just while they were discussing whose child would be given over to the monster, a little girl suddenly stood up and came forward.
Paimon: No! Don't do it, little girl!
Yun Jin: Unbeknownst to anybody else, she was concealing an exorcist's blade. She approached the monster's lair, feigning fear and trepidation... When she finally arrived, she courageously drew her sword and entered into a fierce struggle with the monster, from which she eventually emerged as the victor.
Yun Jin: Her extraordinary abilities drew the attention of the adepti, and they took her as one of their own. Her story became the stuff of legends... But alas, the paths of mortals and adepti seldom cross, and she would never again re-enter the mortal world.
Yun Jin: "And so, destined to grace the mortal realm for but a brief moment, she vanished like a wisp of smoke into thin air." That's how the opera ends.
Traveler: (Look at Shenhe.)
Shenhe: I really like this story.
Shenhe: But I personally think that perhaps the little girl was... not as brave as the opera makes her out to be.
Shenhe: I'm not sure she deserves all the praise she is given.
Yun Jin: I've never considered that before.
Yun Jin: Opera is always an interpretation of the events it purports to portray. A certain degree of deviation from the truth is always inevitable.
Yun Jin: When my father wrote the script for this play, I suppose his intention was to inspire his audience with the character of the divine damsel.
Shenhe: Mm. I think it's a great story. The ideal story.
Paimon: Well... it sure inspired Paimon! Let's go get ourselves some Starsplinter Iron! Yeah!
Traveler: (Remain silent.)

## Talk 26

Lizheng: The basic structure is beginning to take shape, but there is still a lot of work to do... Get back to it.

### Additional Talk 4

Qiqi: Oh, it's you.
Traveler: Qiqi! What are you doing here?
Qiqi: Seaside. Dangerous.
Qiqi: Qiqi is helping. With the evacuation.
Traveler: "Dangerous"?
Qiqi: Yes. Ningguang said there's something bad in the sea.
Qiqi: So she sent Qiqi, to evacuate everyone.
Qiqi: But, no one will listen to Qiqi. So instead, Qiqi is guarding this place.
Qiqi: If danger comes, Qiqi will protect everyone.
Qiqi: Don't go near the sea. It's too dangerous.
Traveler: "Evacuation"?

### Additional Talk 7

Xiao: What brings you here?
Xiao: Have they found a solution to the danger in the sea?
Traveler: What danger in the sea?
Xiao: Ningguang didn't tell you?
Xiao: Something has happened in Guyun Stone Forest. According to the contract, as an adeptus, I should not get involved for now.
Xiao: But these things can be unpredictable. I have a contingency plan of my own.
Traveler: Xiao, what do you...
Xiao: Only a single mountain lies between here and Liyue Harbor.
Xiao: If things get out of control, I will defend this place myself.

### Additional Talk 8

Keqing: Ah, Traveler, Paimon. I wasn't expecting to run into you out here at Guyun.
Keqing: What brings you here? You'll have to make it quick, I'm afraid, I really can't afford to chat for too long.
Traveler: What are you doing out here?
Keqing: As you can see, we're working on a construction project.
Keqing: Personally, I consider this project to be of greater importance than the Jade Chamber rebuild. That's why I'm here to supervise.
Keqing: I just hope we can complete it on schedule...
Traveler: What is this?
Keqing: A new type of Guizhong Ballista.
Keqing: Ningguang commissioned an expert to dismantle and study the Guizhong Ballista, and design an improved version based on the original.
Keqing: This design is a step down from the adepti's original Guizhong Ballista in terms of firing speed and power, but the good thing about it is that it can be mass-produced.
Keqing: It's also considerably easier to assemble and disassemble. This will allow for flexible deployment, whatever the location.
Keqing: I am confident it will prove very useful in dealing with future crises.

### Additional Talk 11

Paimon: #Look, look, Traveler! The Jade Chamber is floating into the sky!
Paimon: But it seems to be tied down by something...
Baiwen: That's because it's not finished.
Paimon: Hey, Baiwen! And hey, um... people Paimon doesn't know..
Baiwen: Given the enormous scale of the Jade Chamber, we split the construction work into two phases to make sure the structure remains balanced.
Baiwen: Before we find some suitable Plaustrite, we build the Jade Chamber's keel at ground level.
Baiwen: Once the Plaustrite is ready, we place it into the keel and let the partially-constructed Jade Chamber rise up to the height of the surrounding mountain peaks.
Baiwen: The remainder of the construction work is then carried out at that altitude. Once everything is ready, we release the iron tethers and allow the Jade Chamber to rise to its target altitude.
Changgui: Miss Baiwen, we've brought some new materials to submit—
Baiwen: One moment. I'll be right there.
Baiwen: The construction work has only been able to progress this rapidly thanks to the Plaustrite provided by you. Lady Ningguang is most grateful and looks forward to seeing more of your work.
Beidou: Wow! Can't believe you sourced the Plaustrite so quickly — it's the key piece of the puzzle. Looks like you beat us to the punch.
Beidou: Wait, I know you. You're the one who fought against the Fatui and Osial, right? Sure enough, your reputation precedes you.
Beidou: Pleasure to meet you, I'm Beidou, Captain of The Crux.
Paimon: Beidou... are you here to join the Jade Chamber contest too?
Beidou: Sure am. I happened to get my hands on a chunk of Sunset Vermillionite on a voyage a while back, so I figured I'd bring it over.
Paimon: Huh, so even though it's rare, we're not the only ones who managed to get hold of it...
Beidou: Oh, I've got some introductions to do: This is the renowned Ms. Yun, or Yun Jin, probably the most famous figure in the Liyue opera scene.
Yun Jin: Greetings.
Beidou: #These two are Paimon and Traveler, I'm sure you've heard of them before. And this is... um, sorry, I'm not sure we've met.
Shenhe: Shenhe. I am their... friend.
Beidou: Hahaha... Good to meet ya! Well, from today on, I guess all of us are friends!
Beidou: Ms. Yun is also here for the contest. Turned out she needed to borrow a boat, so we came together.
Yun Jin: It's an honor to finally meet you both. I've heard much about you. Ms. Shenhe, though we are only meeting for the first time, I have a feeling that we will get along very well indeed.
Yun Jin: To be honest with you all, I am in great need of this opportunity to ask Lady Ningguang a question. That's why I joined the contest. Thanks to my father's connections, I was able to acquire a specimen of the Plaustrite required. Fortunately, it was approved for submission, despite being a little on the diminutive side.
Paimon: Wow... So it looks like the three of us are competitors now!
Yun Jin: Excuse me for prying, Ms. Shenhe, but... are you competing as well?
Shenhe: #No. I don't have any questions for Ningguang. I just wanted to help Traveler win.
Yun Jin: In that case... I have a proposal to make.
Yun Jin: Lady Ningguang said that the first three contestants to procure all three materials will be awarded the chance to ask a question. Well, there are three teams here. We can split the prize between us.
Yun Jin: Instead of competing against each other, we could work together to secure the top three places between us. What do you think?
Paimon: Sounds great! But how does that change things, exactly?
Beidou: Haha... I think I see where you're going with this, Ms. Yun.
Beidou: The Plaustrite was the most difficult item to source by a long shot. Luckily, all three of us managed to get our hands on it. The two remaining items aren't quite so rare, so as long as one of us finds a way to source it, the other two can hop on the bandwagon.
Beidou: How'd I do? Is that what you had in mind?
Yun Jin: Precisely.
Shenhe: Huh. Interesting approach.
Beidou: Okay then! Alright, I'll go first. I have some leads on these "Wonder Cores."
Beidou: From what I've heard, the core itself is really not that difficult to make. The hard part is getting hold of the ore used as raw materials. I'm gonna head back to the ship and ask Suling if he's heard of them, you guys—
Yun Jin: #We will head into town and seek advice from Master Zhang of Hanfeng's Ironmongers. Thoughts, Traveler?
Traveler: Sounds good. Let's go.
Traveler: You can trust Master Zhang's smithing skills.
Beidou: Wonderful. We'll split into teams then, and whoever makes progress first brings all of us a step closer to victory.
Beidou: I'm gonna take off — see you later!
Paimon: Okay. Let's go.
Paimon: By the way, what question are you gonna ask Ningguang, Yun Jin?
Yun Jin: I'm looking for a venue to host the performance of our new opera. Lady Ningguang has excellent judgment, so I would like to hear her opinion.
Paimon: Whoa... What's the opera called? Paimon wants to go see it!
Yun Jin: The opera is a labor of love by my father. He wrote it based on a popular urban legend about an evil spirit and an adeptus.
Yun Jin: It's called "The Divine Damsel of Devastation."
Yun Jin: It's called "The Divine Damsel of Devastation."
