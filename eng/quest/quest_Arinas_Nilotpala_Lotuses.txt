# Arina's Nilotpala Lotuses


## Talk 1

Arina: Which one is better? The Nilotpala Lotus or Sumeru Rose?
Traveler: About the Nilotpala Lotuses...
Arina: Oh yeah, I posted that commission.
Arina: Did you get five Nilotpala Lotuses?
Traveler: Here are the Nilotpala Lotuses you wanted.
Traveler: Not yet.
Arina: Then it won't be enough for me to decorate my room. I'd ask Armin to check them out.

## Talk 2

Arina: That's nice of you! You don't see Nilotpala Lotuses as beautiful as these in the desert. I'll have Armin come and take a look at them.
