Cisik: Welcome to Pakpaka Flying School!
Traveler: What do you do here?
Cisik: We give all cadets the necessary guidance and help they need. Things have changed a lot, you know. Back in the day, students couldn't expect that kind of tender loving care.
Cisik: But then there was this one time when the coach was a little... strict with their words, and the student in question just happened to have quite a temper... *sigh* Yeah, that's not a fun one to talk about.
Cisik: Anyway, our teaching policy's been shaken up since then. And I mean, nobody slaps a smiling face, and nobody hates compliments, am I right?
Traveler: I'll be off, then.
Cisik: Here's to a pleasant day!
