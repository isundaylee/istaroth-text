Traveler: You are...?
Hammer Li: ...Me? You asking who I am? I'm just a strong pair of arms. The name's Hammer Li.
Hammer Li: I picked that nickname myself. Apparently, all I'm good for is bashing my hammer all day long.
Hammer Li: *sigh* I wish one day the gods would smile on me and give me a Vision...
Traveler: Tell me about your work.
Hammer Li: My work? It's not bad. Not much to say; I hammer this, I hammer that, occasionally that old fart Manager Xiao comes and gives me an earful...
Hammer Li: Anyway, I'm not getting any younger, and this job isn't gonna help me start a family, or buy a boat or house of my own, no matter how long I do it for. So I don't have any big hopes for the future.
Traveler: Vision?
Hammer Li: What about them? You're interested in them too?
Hammer Li: I've heard that as long as you want something badly enough, a Vision will appear right beside you, ready to do your bidding.
Hammer Li: Wouldn't that be incredible? As for me... I just want a Vision, plain and simple. I've dreamed of having one every day since I was a little boy, but so far I've had no luck.
Hammer Li: If I had a Vision, I could be like those legendary martial nomads who command the wind and rain and cast lightning.
Hammer Li: *sigh* Where are you, my Vision? I've waited my whole youth for you...
