# Missing title (3500624511)


## Talk 1

Jonvelle (???): *sigh* It ran off again. Agh, there's only one left inside the swim ring... What do we do now...
Jonvelle (???): How long is this going to take...
Paimon: Huh, looks like someone's taking pictures... of the Flowcurrent Birds here?
Paimon: Well, they are pretty cute...
Traveler: What with how they sway this way and that...
Paimon: Right? They're so cute, bobbing about as they walk. And when they puff up into a ball and float on the water... Ah, that just makes Paimon feel happy.
Jonvelle (???): That's the spirit, my lovely young lady with the beautifully shiny silver hair! Truly, the one who created these Flowcurrent Birds deserves all the praise this world can offer...
Jonvelle: So great is... Ah, wait, I haven't introduced myself yet. I'm a Flowcurrent Bird photography enthusiast. Call me Jonvelle.
Paimon: #Sure! My name's Paimon, and this is Traveler... Still, why are you sighing sadly over here? Aren't there tons of Flowcurrent Birds around you?
Jonvelle: That's... a long story, but allow me to summarize. There are many just like me, and all of us want to take the most interesting photos...
Jonvelle: And just a few days ago, I came up with an idea most ingenious... That is, to put all the Flowcurrent Birds within my Kamera frame into swim rings!
Traveler: And what might be the meaning in that, exactly?
Jonvelle: The meaning, of course, is that it is utterly meaningless. Flowcurrent Birds can swim, and as such, to have them wear those swim rings...
Jonvelle: ...Is a thing as devoid of meaning as spending Mora to earn the same amount of Mora back!
Paimon: Feels like you're putting too much on their shoulders...
Jonvelle: Indeed, that is what they call "surrealist photography" — one must seek deeper meaning within the photo one takes... Though, unfortunately we've run into some trouble on that front.
Jonvelle: As one might expect, real Flowcurrent Birds don't wear swim rings, and so one cannot, in fact, take such pictures...
Traveler: You did call it "surreal," you know...
Paimon: #Wait. We could just put the swim rings on all the Flowcurrent Birds, couldn't we? C'mon, Traveler. Let's lend a hand, from two Flowcurrent Bird enthusiasts to another!
Traveler: Woohoo, yes, jolly enthusiast cooperation!
Paimon: Ex-actly!
Jonvelle: Wait, really? You'd help me out?
Paimon: Hehe, as long as you give us a few nice pictures once you're done!
Jonvelle: W—Well then, I'd be in your debt!
Traveler: I prefer Flying Squirrels though...
Paimon: Hey, now's not the time for that sort of talk!
Traveler: Indeed, this is hardly something a normal person would have considered...
Jonvelle: When Flowcurrent Birds, who can float on water by themselves, wear swim rings, this will create an overflow of layered meaning within the photo.
Jonvelle: Thus, sufficiently embodying both the themes of "overuse" and "waste"...
Traveler: I prefer Flying Squirrels, to be honest...
Paimon: Well, they're cute too, but could you really bear to say "Flying Squirrels are cuter" right in front of a swimming Flowcurrent Bird's face?

## Talk 2

Jonvelle: Ah, such lovely timing...
Jonvelle: I can barely believe that my photo-taking quest, which had eluded me no matter how hard I tried, was completed so quickly with your help...
Jonvelle: All these Flowcurrent Birds, their bobbing, rolling forms sitting within their swim rings! A sight so moving as to bring one to tears...
Traveler: Is it really that moving...
Jonvelle: Sometimes, we make our life's pursuit out of something that others cannot understand — indeed, even consider absurd.
Jonvelle: Nonetheless, I believe that the number of Flowcurrent Bird enthusiasts in the world shall increase, so long as I keep taking these photos!
Paimon: Paimon one hundred percent believes in this future too!
Jonvelle: Ah, thank you both so much for your help! Please, take these as tokens of my gratitude!
