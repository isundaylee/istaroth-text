# Narration Footnotes


## Talk 1

Kirara: I've delivered packages all over, but I've never seen a mysterious fairytale world like this before!

## Talk 2

Kirara: Nothing to see here, either... Maybe we can find someone to ask...

## Talk 3

Kirara: Aha, over there! I bet we'll find some people there. Let's go take a look!

## Talk 4

Kirara: You wanna check out the area over there? Okay, I'll wait here for you.

## Talk 5

Cappet: Captivated by the epic poetry, and enthralled by the outstanding storytelling, the outlanders knew what their next objective was:
Cappet: Namely, to remove the *clockwork key from the raised platform* up ahead.
Boborano: Cappet, I just realized. You said we all had to speak like bards, but every time you open your mouth, I don't hear any rhymes.
Albizzi: Yeah, I noticed that too. It's one standard for us, and another for you. That's not fair, Cappet.

## Talk 6

Kirara: We'll need the key again, right? Lemme see if I can pull it out... Yoink!

## Talk 7

Kirara: Guess I'll take the clockwork key again then? Yoink!

## Talk 8

Paimon: Is there really no way to get them to stop, Albizzi?
Albizzi: Th—They'll receive new orders tomorrow, I assure you!

## Talk 9

Boborano: Actually, we already have what we need. Even if they catch us and throw us out, it's no great loss.
Cappet: Your wisdom is admirable, but that is not what a courageous person would do.
Albizzi: I apologize. Empathy is not our giant guards' strong suit.

## Talk 10

Detective: #"What a beautiful day!" Thought Traveler, before he was overcome by a creeping sense of foreboding.
Detective: #The voice in his head grew louder: "Must... go to... Pendulum Lane..."

## Talk 11

Boborano: That experience was, honestly, not the best. Reminds me of my childhood, when I had to walk along the tracks my parents had designed.
Albizzi: Back then, we even had to rotate on rack lines.
Albizzi: I apologize. Empathy is not our giant guards' strong suit.

## Talk 12

Detective: #"What a beautiful day!" Thought Traveler, before he was overcome by a creeping sense of foreboding.
Detective: #The voice in his head grew louder: "Must... go to... Pendulum Lane..."

## Talk 13

Boborano: That experience was, honestly, not the best. Reminds me of my childhood, when I had to walk along the tracks my parents had designed.
Albizzi: Back then, we even had to rotate on rack lines.

## Talk 14

Boborano: Now, let me see what—
Cappet: What elaborate fiction the clan of wisdom was able to conjure up.
Boborano: If anyone's listening, I would like to submit these as my last words: "I surrender. I'm the one who murdered Cappet."
Boborano: Haha, look! Look, my clan's history is true as well. There's that same unforgeable signature again, right here!
Cappet: What!?
Albizzi: Does this mean that my clan is the only odd one out...?
Boborano: Given that my clan's wisdom is such a subject of ridicule in your eyes, I will now appeal to my own personal intelligence — which I believe far surpasses that of my clan at large — and make a prediction:
Boborano: It seems likely that the claims made by each of our clans regarding their history and virtue are all true.
Albizzi: Boborano... How can that be?
Kirara: Ah, I get what's going on. Once when I was drinking with Guuji Yae, she bet me a round of Dried Fish that I couldn't guess which cup the Umeboshi was under.
Kirara: Whichever one I guessed, I was always wrong, and Guuji Yae would lift a different cup to reveal the Umeboshi.
Kirara: But then I learned later from one of the shrine maidens, Miyuki, that all of the cups had an Umeboshi under them! *sigh*... Just goes to show, I still got a long way to go before I become a great youkai.
Paimon: Don't mind fox lady, that's just her way of teasing you!
Boborano: Oh! Actually, that reminds me. We can now open these three treasure chests. And unlike the guessing game you mentioned, this one's not a trick...
Albizzi: Cool... Well, once you've plundered the last of Boborano's family wealth, we can go to my clan's place.

## Talk 15

Detective: The cohort of truth-seekers followed Albizzi to his clan's sacred site. They arrived to the sight of a giant guard towering over them.
Albizzi: Up ahead is my clan's gigantified guard. He can be a little pig-headed, and he's incredibly strong. Your weapons won't even scratch him.
Kirara: Wait, but wasn't Cappet's clan the one that's all about strength? So... What do you guys believe in then?
Albizzi: Oh, the guard is one of Cappet's people. Size is a coveted trait in the clan of strength, after all.
Albizzi: Mine is the clan of empathy, and our key contribution is... growth serum!
Kirara: ...What's empathetic about that?
Albizzi: Our ancestors believed that, just maybe, the dragon of old didn't mean us any harm at all. Perhaps the dragon simply didn't notice us, since we are so very tiny.
Albizzi: So they drank the growth serum, and grew even larger than the dragon. Then, they sat the dragon down, calmly explained their perspective, and eventually taught it how to empathize.
Kirara: Uhhh...
Albizzi: The serum isn't what it once was, though. Nowadays, it doesn't make you grow all that much, and it actually makes you lose your empathy... So, I advise we take a detour.

## Talk 16

Traveler: I don't know.
Detective: #C'mon, you'll have to do better than that, kid. I mean, Traveler-Marquis. You and your friends are the only ones who know the truth about us.
Voice From Behind the Door: Question 3: Which is more real, the fiction of the outside world, or the truth of this world?

## Talk 17

Albizzi: We should be getting close.
Kirara: Why is this place so full of junk? Are you the kind of people who never throw away the box when you buy something, 'cause you're worried you won't be able to return it without the original packaging?
Kirara: We'll never find the Oracle Pillars in all this mess!
Albizzi: Never mind that, we have a more pressing issue... It seems there's a slight problem with my clan's family crest. The Marquis may need to utilize their wisdom to solve the issue.
Boborano: Wisdom too, huh? Well, you guys have a bit of everything, don't you? Except empathy.

## Talk 18

Traveler: Both are false.
Detective: Please try to avoid being unnecessarily cruel in your response.
Voice From Behind the Door: Question 3: Which is more real, the fiction of the outside world, or the truth of this world?

## Talk 19

Albizzi: This is the last one.
Albizzi: The signature! ...So it's true! Empathy is one of the founding virtues of Constellation Metropole too!
Boborano: Just as we suspected. All three are the truth.
Cappet: Okay, well this is a lot to process. I feel a little empty inside... Yes, we found the truth, but... there's too much truth.
Kirara: I get you. It's like... in Inazuma, when there were only six books in the Mirage Warriors series, it was really popular.
Kirara: But by the time book number eighty-eight came out, nobody wanted to read it. They'd all lost interest.
Detective: A brief moment of joy is drowned out by a growing feeling of melancholy. But perhaps there is a glimmer of hope to be found, too?
Detective: Anyone? Anyone? Alright, I'll say it: How is it the case that these three versions of history can all be true at once?
Paimon: That's exactly what Paimon was wondering... But Boborano kind of already explained it away earlier.
Paimon: So Paimon was worried she'd look stupid for asking the question.
Boborano: It's not a stupid question at all, my dear little pixie. While I did postulate that different truths may coexist, there is an issue when it comes to these three truths in particular.
Boborano: The problem is, all three truths are the history of the exact same thing — namely, the dragon and the Metropole's origins. Yet all three bear the signature, showing that they're genuine.
Detective: Suddenly, the sound of a bell rings out!

## Talk 20

Traveler: Perhaps... both are equally real.
Detective: Hear, hear. Who can be sure that the outside world isn't just a dream? And that when the dreamer wakes up, they won't just find themselves inside a novel?
Detective: There is no way to know, therefore both are equally real.
Voice From Behind the Door: All correct. You may have the key pedestal.
Black Screen Text: The door opens, and a puff of smoke wafts out.
After the smoke clears, the pedestal appears.
Boborano: #Traveler-Marquis, you know what must be done. Please insert the great clockwork key.
Boborano: Oh — and this is my family crest.

## Talk 21

Kirara: Phew, we made it out. Dunno if we'll still be needing this clockwork key, but I yoinked it out before we ran, just in case!
Paimon: Okay, but back to the truth problem. There are three conflicting versions of the truth, and somehow they're all still true. What is that supposed to mean?
Boborano: I don't know. I doubt anyone here in Simulanka could make sense of it. All we do know is that any manuscript bearing her signature has to be valid.
Cappet: She is the Goddess of Fate, the creator of all of this. And all these manuscripts are her grand design.
Albizzi: The reason we argued about who was right was that we didn't know enough about the truth of the past. But now we have the truth, so we just have to accept it.
Albizzi: As surely as we will follow the clockwork path designed for us, so is this the course that history has taken. It is clear and incontrovertible.
Boborano: We will never argue again. Thank you all.
Detective: Is that all there is to it? Is this where the decision made at the first crossroads of destiny has led us to? A pointlessly happy ending?
Detective: Eh, overthinking it would be equally pointless. Well, that's enough for one day — time to take a break.
Paimon: Could you be any more cryptic? You're planning something, Paimon knows it...
Boborano: Whatever happens, today was a breakthrough in my journey of discovery. I will go back and share it with my clan.
Cappet: Me too.
Albizzi: And me.
Kirara: Let's leave it there for today then. I'm sure we'll find out what else Mr. Narrator has planned for us tomorrow.

## Talk 22

Traveler: We're all good!
Kirara: Great! Then let's go!

## Talk 23

Traveler: I'll be right back...
Kirara: Sure. Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere!

## Talk 24

Bystander: Oh my god, this is terrible! I don't understand, the three great clans of Constellation Metropole have finally made peace with each other. Who could have done this?
Kirara: What happened? Oh no, someone's lying on the ground... Cappet!
Paimon: How did this happen?
Boborano: Cappet, you idiot, wake up! You need to revise your last words, or everyone's gonna start suspecting me!
Detective: Last words? What did he say?
Albizzi: "If I wind up dead one day, the murderer was Boborano."
Boborano: Gah, you could have at least pretended to not remember it!
Albizzi: I'm sorry, Boborano, but this is an interrogation. I have to give the detective straight answers...
Detective: Don't worry, Boborano. I don't consider you a suspect, nor do I have the authority to charge anyone with a crime. So, are you the last people to have had contact with him?
Traveler: Y—Yes...
Detective: My sincere condolences. You were travel companions, right? It's a real tragedy... I'm afraid he'll be out cold for another hour and a half, at least.
Paimon: ...Huh?
Detective: I know. It's despicable. Hitting someone in the back of the head is the second-worst act of cruelty there is. The first being replacing their gear oil with extra-strong glue.
Kirara: So... Cappet's... not dead?
Detective: His gears, metal frame, and shell are all still in excellent condition. It's just his energy supply that's been all messed up...
Detective: Wait, but... Surely you can't be suggesting that just because Cappet isn't broken, there's no need to go looking for the culprit...?
Paimon: No no, there's a need! Huge need.
Detective: ...Unfortunately, this is rapidly turning into a cold case. There's no evidence, and no witnesses. Unless there's an official clockwork pedestal of the Goddess of Prophecy around here somewhere...
Detective: *cough* *cough* ...Ahem, excuse me.
Detective: Then, suddenly, the long-lost dragon of old flew across the sky!
Kirara: Where, where?
Boborano: I didn't see anything... Wait, why can't I move?
Detective: My mistake, it was just a cloud. Or a bird, or something.
Detective: If only we could turn time backwards and replay the crime.
Traveler: Uh...
Kirara: Isn't that one of those... clockwork socket things, right behind you?
Detective: #Ah! So it is. No wonder everyone here is suddenly struggling to move. Traveler, if you please, let's recreate the crime scene.

## Talk 25

Detective: Well, that clears it up. Cappet was walking along the street, then he suddenly collapsed. He was faking it.
Paimon: What, so case closed? Aren't you supposed to investigate a little more first?
Detective: We literally replayed the crime scene and saw it with our own eyes. There's no need for any evidence-gathering or powers of deduction now. Besides, maybe the truth is inherently strange by nature.
Detective: Like how Constellation Metropole has three histories, each of which is the truth.
Kirara: But didn't you say Cappet was struck in the back of the head and knocked unconscious?
Detective: For all I know, he could have bashed his head against the toilet bowl before leaving the house. Then walked here in a daze before finally passing out.
Detective: As for why he might have done that... My guess is:
Kirara: ...Is...?
Detective: With the Supreme Clan question left unanswered, and the tension in Constellation Metropole suddenly wiped away, he was looking to create a new source of conflict.
Detective: Only then would the city feel alive again.
Paimon: Huh... Do we really think he's capable of that, though? Sounds like a pretty complicated conspiracy for the average Simulanka resident...
Kirara: #Traveler, something about the crime scene isn't sitting right with me... It just seems unnatural.
Kirara: Also, anything outside of the immediate area won't have appeared in the replay. Is it possible that something was missing from the scene?
Kirara: Why don't we search the area?
Detective: Wait, what are you doing?
Kirara: Oh, we're uh... we're gonna head to Cappet's house to check the toilet bowl for signs of an impact.

## Talk 26

Shop Owner: You're... not from these parts, are you? Just visiting?
Kirara: Yep, that's right. Why, what's up?
Shop Owner: Ah. Well, I was gonna offer you a great job in the toytanium mines. A safe and secure working environment.
Kirara: Uh... Doesn't sound very safe... At least, not as safe as being a courier.
Shop Owner: To keep the toytanium ore intact, we use specially designed pickaxes that can't cut through it. Even if you struck a person with it, it wouldn't so much as leave a scratch.
Shop Owner: And in terms of labor intensity, the work has been rated as class-two physical labor by a reputable organization. Even cats can do it.
Kirara: I'm not a— Ugh, never mind. I give up.
Paimon: Welcome to Paimon's world...
Shop Owner: Mind you, I don't know what happened today, but somehow a pickaxe has gone missing. Maybe one of the giant guards broke down, so someone took it to perform a rapid resuscitation procedure.
Kirara: Sounds pretty brutal for a first-aid technique...
Kirara: #Still, a missing pickaxe, huh... Is it just me, Traveler, or does that seem kinda suspicious?

## Talk 27

Grocery Store Owner: *sigh* Come here — whatever it is you were looking to buy, please do come back tomorrow. It's just, I have to close early today.
Grocery Store Owner: A bottle of growth serum has gone missing. If someone's stolen it with the intention of harming others, the consequences could be disastrous.
Grocery Store Owner: There's a whole investigation into it, so I gotta close the shop while I do an inventory count. If it turns out I'm wrong and I miscounted, I could be charged with filing a false report and disturbing the peace...

## Talk 28

Kirara: Let's say one of these was the weapon used in the assault. Which one do you think it is?

## Talk 29

Boborano: ...So it was you.
Detective: Hehe, hahahaha!
Detective: I would congratulate you for cracking the case, but since I did such an abysmal job of covering my tracks, you didn't exactly have your work cut out for you.
Detective: So all I can say is:
Kirara: ...Is...?
Detective: Catch me if you can!

## Talk 30

Boborano: Stop the poem, we have a situation... Something's up with this person.
Kirara: #Traveler, are you alright?
Traveler: Turns out... there's glue...
Black Screen Text: You try to stand up, but the glue is holding you firmly in place...
Paimon: C'mon, you can do it! Th—This can't be how our story ends...!
Traveler: (Try to stand up)
Black Screen Text: You manage to partially un-stick yourself. The issue isn't that you can't break free — it's more that you don't want to tear your clothes in the process. They mean a lot to you.
Kirara: Can I give you a hand? Or a tail, even?
Traveler: (Keep trying to stand up)
Black Screen Text: You finally free yourself and stand up, clothes intact.

## Talk 31

Kirara: You've got nowhere left to run!
Detective: Alright, I confess.
Paimon: That was fast!
Detective: Getting caught by you here was a backup plan. I don't know if what I've done will make things better or not.
Detective: Time to come clean. I am the narrator, the one who's been guiding you all this time.
Traveler: Yeah, I figured...
Detective: Hahaha, okay. I guess my voice-acting skills have some room for improvement.
Detective: Anyway, I only did what I did because—
Paimon: Why are you suddenly spilling the beans?
Detective: I poured my heart and soul into all this. I was worried you wouldn't ask.
Detective: The truth is, I was one of the first conscious beings ever made by the Goddess of Creation. And I've known for a long time that this whole world is just a fairytale, written by the Goddess of Fate.
Traveler: ...!
Detective: I know they say that fairytales are just made up for kids to read. But I refuse to believe that fairytales are just fictional stories, and nothing more.
Detective: The reason why Constellation Metropole has three origin stories is that the Goddess of Fate wrote three drafts, and couldn't decide which one she liked best.
Detective: Then, her cat trod all over them and they all got crumpled together. So the three worlds just sort of folded into one.
Detective: The Goddess of Fate was torn between them anyway, since she couldn't decide which ending was best for the dragon or the kids.
Detective: So when she saw what the cat had done, she simply decided to go with all three.
Paimon: Who'd have thought... But what does any of this have to do with what you did?
Detective: You're not a fictional character, so you couldn't hope to understand my sorrow. Honestly, I don't think there's anyone in all of Simulanka who would understand.
Detective: Every day that I experience, every interaction I have with another person... Is it really all just a work of fiction?
Detective: The only reason the three great clans wanted to find out the truth was for the pointless task of electing the Supreme Clan. I thought that once they'd learned the truth, it might make them curious enough to investigate further.
Detective: But as it turned out, they just... accepted it. And carried on living the same old lives.
Detective: I have to motivate them to keep looking for answers, now that they think they've learned the truth. I have to make them uncomfortable with the superficial explanation that they took at face value.
Detective: And I have to figure out, once and for all, while you real people from the outside world are still here: Are we real?
Paimon: Aw...
Detective: That's my full confession. Time for you to take me back. I'm guessing I'll probably be forced to make a public apology, then sentenced to half a day in solitary confinement. I definitely deserve half a day.
Detective: Oh, also, pass this message onto Cappet, Boborano, and Albizzi, if you could: The great clockwork key was originally put in place jointly by the ancestors of the three clans.
Detective: If the three of them had had any ability to cooperate whatsoever, they'd have been able to remove it by themselves.
Detective: Over all these years, not once have they ever tried removing it together.
Footnote: Oh, my poor child. There's one thing you've been mistaken about this whole time.
Kirara: Aah! Whose voice is that!? ...Detective, was that you? Your voice acting's actually pretty good.
Footnote: The reason fairytales are suitable for children is that they help them to understand the world.
Footnote: Fairytales may be works of fiction, but at their heart lies an internal logic that is undoubtedly real-world truth in a condensed form. Perhaps they simplify good and evil, and perhaps they hide the darkness in metaphors.
Footnote: But let there be no doubt: The world within fairytales is as real as can be. And by extension, you and your compatriots are also real.
Detective: Goddess! Is it really you!?
Footnote: The line that separates footnotes from narrative can never be crossed. Never the two shall meet. This is why you have never heard my voice before.
Footnote: But now, you wish to break free from the story — and there's a cat nearby — so you can hear my echo.
Kirara: Nekomata...
Detective: ...Just your echo...?
Detective: ...
Paimon: Aw... Poor detective...
Detective: So... we are a part of the real world, too...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): You lead the surrendered detective back to Cappet...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): "So we need a shot of the crime scene for evidence, a mugshot of the suspect for the records, and a photo of the heroes for posterity..." The guard mulled it over. "Three photos is overkill. Let's just get one big group photo at the crime scene."

"Suspect, try and look more serious. Heroes, more natural please, happy smiles! ... But no smiling from the victim or their friends and family, thank you. No no, don't get up! Stay on the ground, we need to capture the crime-scene as-is!"


"3, 2, 1, say cheeeeese!"
Traveler: (Weirdest photo experience of my life...)
Traveler: Gasp! Shock! My mind is blown!
Detective: You're overdoing it a little bit there.

## Talk 32

Kirara: So, are you all set? Ready to start investigating?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Constellation Metropole Royal Guard: Hello there. Have you seen my spear, by any chance?
Constellation Metropole Royal Guard: Someone was shouting about a dragon a minute ago, and I instinctively threw it into the sky, yeah...

### Additional Talk 2

Cappet: My head's spinning. Albizzi just gave me a quick rundown of the situation. So you caught the detective?
Paimon: Sorta, we chased him until he surrendered. Oh, and he asked us to pass on a message...
Black Screen Text: You tell the three about the rest of what happened...
Black Screen Text: ...And that they could have removed the great clockwork key if they'd just worked together.
Cappet: Does he really think we didn't try that? 'Cause we did. After six months in that place.
Boborano: That was my bad. I thought it was a stupid idea at the time, so I didn't really exert myself.
Albizzi: I, uh... I also sort of stopped trying after three years.
Cappet: You...! *sigh* Never mind, I'm partly to blame as well. On the second attempt, I just hugged the key and pretended like I was pulling as hard as I could.
Kirara: You guys are so lazy... My granny's neighbor's pet dog has nothing on you, and it spends all day every day sunbathing.
Cappet: Anyway, you said you heard the voice of the Goddess of Fate at the end? That's amazing.
Albizzi: There is a world beyond our own after all.
Cappet: What would you guys say to taking a trip to the outside world some time? Otherwise, I got bashed in the back of the head for nothing.
Boborano: Depends, do either of you know how to get there...? But yes, I agree, we should go. And not invite the detective, just to annoy him.
Boborano: But maybe the reason we never worried about whether we're real or not is that, unlike him, we weren't there to witness the creation of this world. We've never had any reason to doubt that we're real.
Boborano: If someone ever convinced me that these delightful dimwits, Cappet and Albizzi, weren't real... I'd be devastated.
Albizzi: Hehe.

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: The growth serum?
Kirara: If it was the growth serum, Cappet would've been turned into a giant.
Paimon: Also, the bottle probably would've shattered when it hit him. We would have seen the debris on the ground.
Kirara: Let's say one of these was the weapon used in the assault. Which one do you think it is?

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: The guard's spear?
Kirara: If so, there's no way his head would still be in such good shape. He'd have a big dent in the back.
Paimon: And if the guard is to be believed, he had the spear in his possession right up until that guy shouted about the dragon.
Kirara: Let's say one of these was the weapon used in the assault. Which one do you think it is?

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: The pickaxe?
Paimon: If it was the pickaxe, Cappet sure is lucky it's not still lodged in his head...
Kirara: Actually, you're wrong there, Paimon. The foreman at the mine was just saying, this kind of pickaxe is designed not to damage toytanium, so it couldn't cause any superficial damage to residents here.
Kirara: But, you could probably knock someone out if you hit them hard enough. And it wouldn't leave a scratch.
Kirara: Let's take this back to the crime scene and replay it one more time.

### Additional Talk 6

Detective: Ah, you're back. How was the toilet at Cappet's house?
Kirara: Toilet? What about it? ...Oh yeah. Uh, forget that!
Traveler: (Show the pickaxe)
Detective: What's this about? What are you trying to say?
Kirara: We thought the way Cappet fell looked odd, so we searched the area for suspicious items and found this.
Kirara: It could have been deliberately placed out of range of the crime scene so it wouldn't show up when we replayed it. Now we've retrieved it, we were gonna replay it again — you don't mind, do you?
Detective: Oh, uh... I just remembered, I forgot to turn off the clockwork switch in my kitchen, I think I'll just—
Boborano: Oh no, you stay right there!
Detective: Uhh...
