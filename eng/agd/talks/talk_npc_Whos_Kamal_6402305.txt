Traveler: Who's Kamal...?
Shams: Kamal is my old pal!
Shams: But Kamal's already packed it in and doesn't do this business with me anymore... *burp* He insisted on joining some doggone Adventurers' Guild.
Shams: The way I see it, those small-fry jobs the Adventurers' Guild is slinging aren't nearly as — *burp* Aren't nearly as exciting as my work...
Shams: Maybe he just got tired of it. If you have the spare time — *burp* — don't forget to bring my old pal Kamal some good food and drinks.
