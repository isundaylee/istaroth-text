Traveler: Hello.
Iraj: Hello, do you need any help?
Iraj: Hmm... You look strong and energetic. I don't think you do.
Iraj: Then enjoy the rainforest! The way of life in the forest may be quite primitive, but you won't find any place that is cleaner and more comfortable than here.
Iraj: I often volunteer to change shifts with my colleagues, just to wander the forest a little longer.
Iraj: ...Oh, of course I'll still carry out my duty seriously if something really does happen.
