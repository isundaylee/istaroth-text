Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Xiangling: I love it! Very cozy. And there are so many new and interesting things I've never seen before!
Xiangling: Just a shame more of them aren't potential ingredients...
Traveler: Considering all the things you class as ingredients, that's really saying something.
Xiangling: Hee-hee...
Xiangling: But really... Don't worry about it!
Xiangling: Combining existing ingredients in new ways already allows for countless variations in flavor.
Xiangling: The trick is to keep playing with different pairings — I've got plenty of new concepts to try out!
Xiangling: But, um... What would really make a difference is if you could taste-test them a—and give me some feedback.
Traveler: Sure! I'll give you my honest opinion. No sugarcoating.
Xiangling: Waah! Really? Great, I'll get cooking!
Traveler: I'll see what I can do about that...
