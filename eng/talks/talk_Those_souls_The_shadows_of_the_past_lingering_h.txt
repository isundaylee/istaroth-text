Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Those souls... The shadows of the past lingering here... If we can defeat Boethius, perhaps they too can at last find peace...
Traveler: Why would their souls...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Obsession? Delusions? Regardless, the bodies created by the Sebastos offered us a sanctuary to which we could flee.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Just as he hoped, the sea will steal neither our souls nor our lives... But it is because of this that our souls have become all the heavier.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Rather than my kin now being trapped beneath the depths by the Symphony, it is more accurate to say that they, like Boethius, are bound here by their own obsession.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): A pitiable fate...
Traveler: (Pet him.)
Traveler: It's nothing.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Alright. If there is anything you wish to know, do not hesitate to ask me.
