Coyopa: The Pyro Archon seems to have been pretty busy lately. The Masters of the Night-Wind haven't made any big announcements, have they?
Coa: No news on my end. How about you?
Coyopa: Uh... If I knew what was going on, why would I be asking you?
Coyopa: ...Well, either way, nothing much we can do about it, and there's no point in just standing here. Why don't we go grab a drink instead?
Coa: You're not trying to trick me into going to Xocolatl Beverages again, are you? How about... No.
