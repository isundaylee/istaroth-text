# Food Delivery


## Talk 1

Sara: Order for delivery
Sara: Hey, Traveler! What's happeningâ€”
Sara: ...Oh, you're just here to eat, you say?
Sara: I understand, really I do... But I promise you I will make you the best meal you ever tasted if you just lend me a hand first.
Sara: Ernest from the Dawn Winery often orders food from here to pair with his wine, and his orders always come with special requests.
Sara: This time he wants *Fried Radish Balls* but with egg added in. Unfortunately, I'm fresh out of eggs!
Sara: So if you could just go ahead and grab me a couple of Bird Eggs, that would be great.
Traveler: If you insist...
Sara: There must be plenty of Bird Eggs around Windrise.
Sara: I appreciate it!
Traveler: I only came here to eat; I'm starving!
Sara: There must be plenty of Bird Eggs around Windrise.
Sara: Once you've done what I ask, I'll treat you to something from the Good Hunter special menu! Much obliged.

## Talk 2

Traveler: I come bearing ingredients.
Sara: That'll do it. One moment...
Sara: It's ready! Now, get these *Fried Radish Balls* to Ernest, pronto!
Sara: ...Don't give me that look, I know you're famished.
Sara: There'll be a special Good Hunter surprise waiting for you when you get back!

## Talk 3

Traveler: Your meal, sir.
Ernest: Aha! My *Fried Radish Balls*... and prepared just as I requested!
Ernest: Mmm... Yes, the addition of eggs does indeed do wonders for the texture and aroma.
Ernest: Oh yeah! I know what I'm doing when it comes to food. *mwah!*
Ernest: Oh, and this is for you. Many thanks!

## Talk 4

Sara: Deliver meal fee
Sara: You're back! Did you make the delivery?
Traveler: Here's the fee.
Sara: Let's see... Excellent! Thank you.
Sara: Here, this *Crab, Ham & Veggie Bake* is for you. It's fresh out of the oven, eat it while it's hot.

## Talk 5

Ernest: Mmm... Yes, that rich eggy aroma just hits you straight away, but it's not overpowering thanks to the freshness of the carrot. I've missed my calling, should have been a chef!
