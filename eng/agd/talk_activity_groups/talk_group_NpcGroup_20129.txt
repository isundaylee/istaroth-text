## Talk

Childish Jiang: So bored... Need someone to play with...
Traveler: What are you up to?
Childish Jiang: Mom and dad don't have time to come home and play with me, so I have to play here all by myself. But it's so boring playing with only one person...
Childish Jiang: Also, I can't stray too far from home, otherwise mom and dad wouldn't be able to find me when they got back, and then they'd start worrying.
Childish Jiang: Do you wanna play with me? We can play hide-and-seek, it's really easy, anyone can play it.

## Talk

Traveler: Sure, I love that game!
Childish Jiang: Yay! Alright, let the game begin!
Childish Jiang: Um, but gimme a sec first... I haven't thought where to hide...
Childish Jiang: ...Okay, I got it! Hehehe, you'll never find me!
Childish Jiang: Ready?

## Talk

Traveler: Sorry, no hiding and seeking for me today...
Childish Jiang: Okay... Guess I'll play alone some more then...

## Talk

Traveler: I'm ready!
Childish Jiang: Okay! Uh, on your marks... get ready... let's go!

## Talk

Traveler: Not just yet...
Childish Jiang: Okay, well you do what you gotta do... and when you're ready, let me know!

## Talk

Childish Jiang: When will Mommy and Daddy get back...

## Talk

Traveler: Is this your home?
Childish Jiang: Yep! I live here with Mommy and Daddy. But actually, I don't know where they are right now.
Childish Jiang: But that means that I have to stay nearby. I mean, what if they came back and couldn't find me? They'd be so worried...

## Talk

Traveler: What's your daily life like?
Childish Jiang: There's a man who comes and gives me food sometimes. He says that I should call him Uncle Tian, and that he's a distant relative, and that he knows my mom and dad really well.
Childish Jiang: He says mom and dad are busy right now and can't come home, so if there's anything I need, I can just go to him instead.
Childish Jiang: But when I asked him where mom and dad are, he didn't tell me. So I think he's a bit of a weirdo, too.
Childish Jiang: There's also a bunch of Milleliths who come and see me, too. They always bring me lots of tasty snacks. Sometimes I can't manage them all, so they just leave them in the house for me.
Childish Jiang: But they say that they don't know where mom and dad are, either. It's so strange...

## Talk

Traveler: What are those two stone tablets...
Childish Jiang: Oh, those stones are from the Milleliths, too. They said Mommy and Daddy got them to put them up here for them.
Childish Jiang: But I can't read very well. There's so many words on them that I don't recognize...
Childish Jiang: But I guess if they're from Mommy and Daddy, they must be really important to them, right?

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Childish Jiang: Mm, see you. Do come back to play with me again if you have the time!
