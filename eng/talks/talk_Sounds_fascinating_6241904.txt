Traveler: Sounds fascinating...
Ziwei: It is! Look, this one is called "Fungora Boareas..." Get it? Because it looks like a boar digging for mushrooms.
Ziwei: And this one is "Geo Lord Versus Bovine Beast." Look, look, here's the cow's head... and here's his horns...
Traveler: ...Nope, I don't see it.
Ziwei: Look harder... And this one! So this one is "Frosted Jade Crystal Vase with Mother-of-Pearl Inlay, Inlaid with Pearls..." Isn't it the spitting image!?
Traveler: I don't quite get it...
Ziwei: That's normal if you're not versed in astronomy. To be fair, it does require a certain grasp of the basics to appreciate the secrets of the stars and their patterns.
Ziwei: If you're really interested, I'd recommend that you read the column about constellations in The Steambird.
Ziwei: Ever since Astrologist Mona Megistus took over that column, she'll often write some very interesting things.
Ziwei: Even though I don't entirely get it myself, it is rather fascinating! I will definitely continue supporting her!
