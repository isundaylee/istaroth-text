# Tatara Tales: Priority Investigation


## Talk 1

Xavier: #Hello there, my dear, gallant {F#girl}{M#boy}! I have good news and bad news regarding the Mikage Furnace. Which would you like to hear first?
Traveler: Let's have the good news.
Xavier: The good news is that the core's only suffered some minor damage. It is still within my power to fix it.
Xavier: The bad news, however, is that the Fatui poking around in there don't seem to appreciate this piece of good news.
Xavier: They very much seem to be searching for a way to get their grubby hands on the Tatarigami core.
Xavier: But if we let them meddle any further, the Tatarigami's power will get out of control. This entire island will be blown sky-high with us still on it.
Xavier: However, if we focus solely on the Fatui, the Tatarigami energy built up inside the containment dome will eventually reach its limit all the same...
Traveler: So we need to deal with both of them at the same time?
Xavier: Well... Put simply, academically speaking, in an objective sense...
Xavier: We are facing two separate problems here: the Fatui and the Tatarigami.
Xavier: But with how the situation is inside the Mikage Furnace, whichever problem we choose to tackle, we're likely to have to face the other in the process.
Xavier: So, ultimately, the fact of the matter is—
Traveler: You mean to say, "yes."
Xavier: Um, yes, that's correct. We need to deal with both of them at the same time.
Xavier: But one step at a time. As the Liyue saying goes, "don't rush to eat hot tofu, or you'll burn your tongue."
Traveler: How come you know Liyue proverbs?
Xavier: We've been to Liyue before. I'd consider this little gem of wisdom a souvenir from the trip.
Xavier: I have a lot more of these souvenirs where that one came from. I must confess to having imbibed all of my "souvenirs" from Mondstadt, though... they were really very good.
Xavier: Let's get back on track. I have a teensy-tiny plan to fix this Mikage Furnace situation, but I will need your help.
Traveler: You got it!
Xavier: Ha! Forthright and ready for a fight! That's what I like about you!
Xavier: Ahem. I digress. Now, hold on to these Sensor Beacons, if you please.
Xavier: I need you to place them in a number of locations for me.
Xavier: What these Sensor Beacons will do is gather data on the density and distribution of Tatarigami energy within the Mikage Furnace. Once armed with this data, I should be able to come up with a more detailed plan.
Traveler: Leave it to me, then.
Xavier: I shall leave it in your hands, indeed.
Xavier: I will mark the locations for the beacons on your map. I'll be counting on you, Traveler!
Traveler: How do these beacons work?
Xavier: The simplest way to explain it is that they are instruments that use elemental power to quantify and calculate all other sorts of energy.
Xavier: Well, I say "simple," but it's not actually that easy to explain... But I suppose we could start from the theory of the seven elements! Now then—
Traveler: No, no, you don't need to go on.
Xavier: Well, as you wish.
Traveler: Well, what do I get out of this?
Xavier: Hmm... how about the undiscovered treasures of this island, and some "leftover materials" from inside the Mikage Furnace?
Xavier: I'm sure there must some things of note inside the Mikage Furnace, what with it being the largest smelting facility in Inazuma and all.
Xavier: Of course, as someone who does not possess a Vision, I am unable to enter the Mikage Furnace at present, nor would I really know about what's going on in there.
Traveler: *sigh* Let's hear the bad news.
Xavier: The bad news is that the Fatui are still poking around inside the Furnace.
Xavier: They very much seem to be searching for a way to get their grubby hands on the Tatarigami core.
Xavier: The good news is that the core hasn't suffered much damage, so I can take care of it myself.
Xavier: Obviously, the Fatui will be none too pleased to hear that.

## Talk 2

Xavier: Hopefully this is as far as the situation escalates...

## Talk 3

Xavier: Have you placed those beacons?
Traveler: Yep.
Xavier: Well done, now all we have to do is to let them collect the data.
Traveler: How did you know where to put them?
Xavier: I was part of the design team for the Mikage Furnace. By placing beacons in these locations, we can gather data on almost all the areas inside.
Xavier: Hmm, you know, if we set up purifying devices in these locations, our troubles would be over overnight.
Xavier: If Mr. Flois knew half of what had happened here, he'd go completely ballistic...
Xavier: Alright, thanks for your help. Please take these as compensation.
Xavier: Ahem, one other thing... I may possibly, probably, definitely need you to help me retrieve the beacons again at some point over the next few days.
Xavier: I don't have a Vision, after all, so I can't simply stroll into somewhere with such a high concentration of Tatarigami energy.
Xavier: Not to mention that those, hmm, rough-and-tough Fatui folks are still there. I honestly think you are the only person on this whole island capable of dealing with them and the furnace at the same time.
Traveler: Are these beacons for sale?
Xavier: You jest! Even if I sold them to you, what would I use then?
Xavier: Seriously, though, if you ever visit Fontaine, I can put you in touch with someone who will sell them to you at a very fair price.
