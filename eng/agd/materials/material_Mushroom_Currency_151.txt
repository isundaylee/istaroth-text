# Mushroom Currency

A finely-crafted memorial coin, and the reward given to outstanding participants in the Fungus Capture and Coruscating Potential stages of the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament.
No matter the results of the competition, these coins are proof of the friendly associations between the participants and the tame Fungi.
These coins can be used to exchange for precious items during the "Fabulous Fungus Frenzy" event.
