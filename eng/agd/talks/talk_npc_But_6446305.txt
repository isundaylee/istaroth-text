Traveler: But...
Mandora: Oh, I misspoke earlier. I should have said, "I stopped adventuring in Mandora's stead."
Mandora: She left me here, and returned to her world of thrilling travels and brilliant adventures. Tsk, she really is a clever girl! But you know, that's just typical of adventurers.
Mandora: Just like how anyone swearing "This is the last time, I promise!" always breaks their promises!
Mandora: *sigh* Of course, after becoming "Mandora," I can understand how she felt... So it's not like I'll get riled up over it. It's just that...
Mandora: After she left the Mirage... does she ever still think of me? If the thought of me could strengthen her resolve and help her walk her chosen path, that would really be something, haha.
