# Missing title (742751359)


## Talk 1

Cosanzeana: Ah, so Windwheel Asters are these golden-red flowers. They're so warm and bright.
Cosanzeana: And they really do spin, just like you said, Paimon! Ooh, it does burn the eyes a tad to stare too long at them, though.
Paimon: Golden... and eye-scorching?
Cosanzeana: Since Windwheel Asters are so bright, the "windwheels" themselves must be really bright, too. People must mount them on their homes to produce light, right?
Paimon: Uh, that's not how we use them, no.

## Talk 2

Cosanzeana: Why? Why won't they sprout...
Paimon: Hey there, what are you busy with? Ooh. This is what they call a "home vegetable garden," right?
Cosanzeana: A v—vegetable garden? But this is supposed to be a flower garden... Oh no, I'm not a very good florist, am I...
Paimon: Eh? Did Paimon get something wrong? Sorry, sorry.
Paimon: Huh, so was this what you were talking about previously when you said that you had no flowers to give us, Cosanzeana?
Cosanzeana: That's right. I've planted all these seeds, but nothing's happened yet. They aren't all ruined, are they?
Paimon: That would be such a shame! You'd need to start over in that case, wouldn't you?
Cosanzeana: That's right. I mean, what I want is a beautiful flower garden... I don't want people to call it a vegetable garden...
Paimon: Hmmm. If that's the case, just let us, the ever-helpful helpers, help you!
Cosanzeana: #Paimon and {NICKNAME}... Do you know how to garden? Can you help me?
Traveler: I've been known to plant some flowers and crops here and there.
Cosanzeana: Ooh, that's so cool! My wish is to become an awesome florist! ...But the flowers I plant always wither.
Cosanzeana: I tried transplanting flowers at first, but they always died. After that, I tried to start them off from seeds, but they just refuse to sprout...
Cosanzeana: Flowers are so beautiful, but raising them is so hard... But humans have gotten used to such hard work, so they have an easy time caring for flowers.
Traveler: Maybe humans just plant flowers in environments better suited to growing them.
Cosanzeana: The environment... The humans who sell flowers also said that "flowers grow better outside." But if I do that, it'll be hard for me to go care for them.
Cosanzeana: It is said that there are all sorts of flowers in faraway places, and maybe, just maybe, some of them might do better here in the village... But I can't go so far from home to collect them myself.
Paimon: #Hehe, then you've met the right people! We, Paimon and {NICKNAME}, have traveled everywhere, and we've seen all sorts of flowers!
Traveler: I've watched others plant flowers.
Cosanzeana: Humans learn by watching others so easily. I tried doing that too, but I still keep failing...

## Talk 3

Traveler: Windwheel Asters, for example.
Paimon: That's right. Windwheel Asters grow out in the wild, and they're a tough breed. Maybe they'll also grow here!
Cosanzeana: "Pinwheel Asters"... I've never heard that name before. Are they really spikey or something?
Paimon: Well, not really. "Windwheels" are things you put on buildings. They have big sails that are like flower petals, and when the wind blows, they spin like this — fwoop, fwoop, fwoop!
Paimon: Windwheel Asters are called that because they spin in the wind as well.
Cosanzeana: So they spin and make fwoop noises? Amazing! I wish I could go see them right now!

## Talk 4

Traveler: (I think that'll do for now.)
Paimon: Well, since you're so curious, Cosanzeana, why don't we help you look for a few exotic flowers?
Cosanzeana: You really would? In that case, could I have all of them at— Wait... no, no. I have to be a responsible florist, so just one type will do for starters.
Cosanzeana: #{NICKNAME}... What kind of flowers would you be willing to bring me?

## Talk 5

Traveler: Let's give her a Naku Weed.
Paimon: Alright, sure! This isn't something you see often in Fontaine, so it'll make for awesome bragging rights with the humans here!

## Talk 6

Paimon: Hmm... Can you think of any other suitable flowers?

## Talk 7

Traveler: Let's find her a Sumeru Rose.
Paimon: Alright, sure! This isn't something you see often in Fontaine, so it'll make for awesome bragging rights with the humans here!

## Talk 8

Cosanzeana: Ah, you're from the outside. W—Welcome, but... I don't have flowers to give you right now.
Paimon: Flowers? Aw, c'mon, there's no need to be so formal.
Cosanzeana: Oh, okay. In that case, let me just welcome you very, very enthusiastically to Merusea Village. Welcome!
Traveler: Thanks a lot!
Cosanzeana: Yup. I'm very enthusiastic, so whatever you want to know, I'll tell you all about it.
Paimon: Nice! In that case, could you tell us a bit about Merusea Village?
Cosanzeana: Sure I can. The village is home to lots of Melusines... Well, you can't see them here, but you will if you keep going forward.
Cosanzeana: Everyone here is a wonderful Melusine, so if you're a good person, you'll definitely be welcomed here!
Traveler: I'm a good person.
Paimon: Paimon is too!
Cosanzeana: And that's good to hear!
Cosanzeana: What should I say next? I... forgot... But I remember that the ending was "I hope you enjoy your stay here in our village"!
Paimon: #Nice! Shall we go have a look, then, {NICKNAME}? We'll see you later, Cosanzeana!
Cosanzeana: See you. I hope that the next time we meet, I'll have lots of flowers ready for you!
Traveler: I wouldn't say that I've never done any evil...
Cosanzeana: Eh? O—Oh no... I... I have to tell my friends who work at the Marechaussee Phantom...
Paimon: #Hey, hey, {NICKNAME} was just joking! We haven't done anything worth us being pursued by the Marechaussee Phantom!
Cosanzeana: ...Really?
Paimon: Really! Of course really!
Cosanzeana: Okay. I trust you.

## Talk 9

Cosanzeana: Hehe. Being able to show off a flower to humans... Oh, I never even dreamed that such a day might come!
Traveler: As long as your wish can come true.
Cosanzeana: You two are the best! I'll definitely pay back your kindness.
Traveler: Consider it compensation for Paimon's transgressions.
Cosanzeana: Oh, that's fine, I'm already over it! Please, help me bring flowers from other lands so I can build the most beautiful garden!

## Talk 10

Traveler: Let's go with a Windwheel Aster.
Paimon: Alright, sure! This isn't something you see often in Fontaine, so it'll make for awesome bragging rights with the humans here!

## Talk 11

Traveler: Let's get her a Silk Flower.
Paimon: Alright, sure! This isn't something you see often in Fontaine, so it'll make for awesome bragging rights with the humans here!

## Talk 12

Paimon: Phew! Planting these flowers is pretty tough!
Traveler: You say that, but it was Cosanzeana and I who did the work.
Paimon: Paimon's been super concerned for these flowers, you know! Mental stress counts as work too!
Cosanzeana: Flowers from distant lands... So strange, yet so beautiful. Hehe, my flower garden will be the envy of the humans!
Paimon: Yup, you don't see them in Fontaine often, so make sure to show them off to the people here a little more, hehe!

## Talk 13

Traveler: Silk Flowers, for example.
Cosanzeana: Silt Flowers? What a strange name. Do they grow in the muck and mud?
Paimon: No, that's not it! If you hear "silk," it means pretty clothes! The flowers themselves are beautiful too, and they can even be worn!
Cosanzeana: Pretty flowers from another land that you can wear? ... That's so cool. I wish I could see one right now.

## Talk 14

Traveler: Naku Weeds, for example.
Paimon: Ooh, that's a good idea! Naku Weeds can even grow in places that are stormy all year round. Surely Merusea Village doesn't have weather that bad!
Cosanzeana: Not-Cool Weeds? A strange name. I've heard that humans display flowers at their "horticultural fairs." Do humans abroad display weeds, too?
Paimon: Well, no. Naku Weeds are a type of flower, not a weed. Even if the wind isn't blowing, they will gently shake when thunder can be heard. That's why the locals use them to predict the coming of a storm!
Cosanzeana: Flowers that can vibrate by themselves... I wonder what those might look like. I'd really want to see them!

## Talk 15

Traveler: Sumeru Roses, for instance.
Paimon: That's right, you can find Sumeru Roses everywhere in Sumeru's rainforests. It's a really tough plant! The rainforest is also pretty humid, so it's quite similar to Merusea Village.
Cosanzeana: Sumeru Roses... I've tried planting other roses. Is there any difference between them and the ones from Sumeru?
Paimon: Hmm... Y'know, Paimon doesn't really know all that much about flower varieties, but its color, at least, is definitely different from the ones you find in Fontaine.
Paimon: But the Sumeru Rose's most distinguishing feature is its scent! You can use it to make great perfumes, and it's amazing when added to desserts, hehe.
Cosanzeana: I've never seen such an exotic rose before, and with a special scent, you say... Mm, I'd love to get a whiff of that.
Traveler: Odds are that Paimon will eat it before you get a chance.
Paimon: Hey, Paimon won't do that! She'll at least wait till it's been made into a proper dish first!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Cosanzeana: Ah, so Silk Flowers are these crystal-clear things. They look so much like pearls!
Paimon: Eh, really? Are they?
Cosanzeana: If one were to wear these flowers, it would be like wearing a waterfall! I've never seen such clothes before, though.
Paimon: Neither has Paimon...
Cosanzeana: Hmm, yes! This must be what the humans call "fashion" — the stranger the better, so I hear.
Paimon: Uh, that's not how you use Silk Flowers, and that's not what fashion is either... is it?

### Additional Talk 2

Cosanzeana: So these are the vibrating flowers...
Paimon: Huh. Without thunder all around and in a cave like this, you can barely tell that they're moving.
Cosanzeana: ...It's hard to make out, but the sound they make when vibrating is very beautiful!
Paimon: They make beautiful sounds? Paimon can't hear 'em, though...
Cosanzeana: The sound is crisp and pleasant to the ear — ah, I can't get enough of it! Such lovely flowers, that sing with such lovely voices...
Paimon: Huh. It seems she really can hear the sound of a Naku Weed when it vibrates. Look how engrossed she is...
Cosanzeana: Hmm... If this "thunder" thing strikes, the Naku Weeds will vibrate more strongly, and the sound they make will be louder, right?
Cosanzeana: Hmmm... This must be because all flowers need fertilizer, and "thunder" is that of the Naku Weed... Do you know where we might buy this "thunder"?
Paimon: From the Raiden Shogun? ...Wait, but thunder isn't fertilizer in the first place!

### Additional Talk 3

Paimon: Hehehe, you can't smell those Sumeru Roses without being reminded of the delicious dishes you can make using them! Rose Custard, Candied Ajilenakh Nuts, Lambad Fish Roll...
Cosanzeana: So this is the Sumeru Rose that you love to eat, Paimon... So many petals, with so many colors...
Paimon: Eh? Sumeru Roses... have many colors?
Cosanzeana: That's right. Petals of many colors combine to form this flower, and their colors shift as it rocks back and forth...
Paimon: They... even change color?
Cosanzeana: Now I get it! When you put Sumeru Roses into food, the food itself will also start to turn into a rainbow of shifting colors. No wonder you love those dishes, Paimon — they must be truly beautiful!
Paimon: Uh, Paimon thinks that you'd only see multicolored food that changes color after eating some poisonous mushrooms...

### Additional Talk 4

Paimon: Paimon didn't think that you would see flowers so differently from us, Cosanzeana... and that explaining things would be so tough... Paimon's head hurts now.
Cosanzeana: Why would your head hurt? You think that those flowers are beautiful, and I see them exactly the same way.
Paimon: Well, they are pretty, but Paimon wouldn't call our perspectives "exactly the same." We definitely share an appreciation for flowers, though, so there's no need to sweat the small stuff — you just concentrate on taking care of them!
Cosanzeana: Yes! Next, I must find some <color=#00E1FFFF>water</color> with which to nourish my precious flowers...
Traveler: No need to trouble yourself, I'll fetch some for you.
Paimon: #That's right, just leave it to {NICKNAME}!

### Additional Talk 5

Paimon: That should do it. Now we just need to leave the flowers to grow.
Traveler: I hope your garden blooms and prospers.
Cosanzeana: Oh, flowers from a distant land... I promise I will cherish you and care for you.
Cosanzeana: The two of you have given me such exotic flowers, and I too must repay you with things that are every bit as beautiful.
Paimon: Heh, c'mon, you're making Paimon blush... But, um, is this component the "thing as beautiful as a flower"?
Cosanzeana: That's right! These components are both lovely and useful to the village, which is why I love them, and love collecting them! I look at them every day, and they make me very happy.
Paimon: (Uh, you could call components "useful," but "beautiful"...?)
Traveler: (Y'know, Paimon, you find Mora beautiful.)
Paimon: (Hehe, that's true. And looking at Mora every day does make Paimon super happy...)
Cosanzeana: "Human lives are so hard," I thought, "so what do they see that makes them happy?" So I went to the human village, and there I saw all the beautiful flowers they had!
Cosanzeana: If Merusea Village were to be filled with all those lovely flowers, I am sure everyone would be very happy.
Cosanzeana: That's why I've decided to become a florist, one who will plant a lovely flower garden in our village! I will succeed, even if it means that I must give up some of my beautiful components and work as hard as humans do...
Paimon: Wow. Paimon didn't realize how much you're willing to do for the flowers you love so much... Your sacrifices won't be in vain! Paimon, kind soul that she is, will continue helping you for sure!
Traveler: You could totally learn from her, you know...
Paimon: #Well, uh... Because Paimon's got you, the super kind-hearted {NICKNAME} around, Paimon only needs to do a liiittle bit of work!
Traveler: ...And make that Mora you love so much yourself...
