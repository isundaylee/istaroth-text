Traveler: Tell me about the trial courts...
Esteban: You won't find the court here. Pursuit of criminal cases takes place at the Opera Epiclese on Erinnyes.
Esteban: That is the home of the divine judge, the mechanism known as the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, the second layer of insurance behind the judges themselves.
Esteban: Well, I'm just a stenographer, so that's what I do — record the proceedings within the opera house.
