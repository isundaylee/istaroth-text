# "The Falcon's Hunt"


## Talk 1

Tadhla: Hello. Are you ready to go?
Traveler: Let's go.
Tadhla: Please follow me.
Traveler: I'm just passing by.
Tadhla: Okay... I'll wait for you.

## Talk 2

Tadhla: Please follow me. We have already confirmed its whereabouts. All that needs to be done is to track it down.
Tadhla: By the way, are you wearing any perfume?
Paimon: No, why'd you ask?
Tadhla: Great, neither am I.

## Talk 3

Masseira: Prey won't hunt themselves for us. Please go find Tadhla to learn what needs to be done.

## Talk 4

Masseira: Ah, you're back. Is there something else you want to talk about? Or are you just looking to chat?
Traveler: About Tadhla...
Masseira: I believe she will be a real Falcon after training with you.
Traveler: About the "coming-of-age ceremony"...
Masseira: Act alone or with company and hunt formidable targets, become a qualified "Falcon" for the tribe, and deal with prey and enemies...
Masseira: Simple.
Traveler: Bye.
Masseira: Good luck with the hunt.

## Talk 5

Tadhla: *pant* If you need my assistance... please let me know, anytime.
Traveler: You should have a rest here.
Tadhla: ...
Traveler: Your condition is not suitable for hunting.
Tadhla: Hmph...

## Talk 6

Liloupar: Paimon, you've been holding your nose the whole time.
Paimon: Because it stinks of blood...
Liloupar: But all the scents that greet me are from wild creatures... Ah, it is not so foul.
Paimon: Ah, speaking of which, where "is" your nose?
Liloupar: Hmph, be silent...

## Talk 7

Tadhla: ...
Paimon: Tadhla, you don't look so well. Do you need some rest?
Tadhla: I'm fine.
Liloupar: Falcons get injured, too. There's no need to be ashamed of such facts, little one.
Tadhla: I'm not.

## Talk 8

Tadhla: ...
Paimon: Eh? What's wrong, Tadhla? Are you still feeling unwell?
Tadhla: No, I'm great.
Liloupar: Should you bear words, give them unto my master now.
Tadhla: ...
Tadhla: I... I am very happy to hunt with you.
Tadhla: Thank you.
Liloupar: Well... that's a first for a Falcon.

## Talk 9

Masseira: Ah, you are back. So, would you like to accept my commission?
Traveler: I'll do it.
Masseira: Very well... Now, for detail of this hunt, please talk to Tadhla.
Traveler: I have to finish something else first.
Masseira: Well then, I shall leave you alone.

## Talk 10

Paimon: Hmm... The Red Vulture won't be back anytime soon. Why don't we check out the <color=#00E1FFFF>shiny stuff</color> first?

## Talk 11

Paimon: Phew... Easy peasy! Paimon didn't even break a sweat!

## Talk 12

Tadhla: You are such a talented hunter. No wonder Father commissioned you to help me with this hunt.
Tadhla: Please leave the rest to me. If you really are interested in this, I can teach you step by step.
Traveler: Please teach me.
Tadhla: Very well.
Black Screen Text: Tadhla demonstrates how to dissect a prey. You and Paimon seem to have learned a new skill that you probably will never actually put into practice.
Black Screen Text: After the demonstration, Tadhla shows you her hands soaked by the blood of her prey, a faint smile appearing on her lips.
This is the first time that she has revealed any trace of her emotions.
Tadhla: Hmm... The smell of blood. Good.
Paimon: Paimon can smell it, too! Uh... Such a strong smell... Aren't you going to wash it off?
Tadhla: No, because we are going to hunt the Scorpion now.
Liloupar: Scorpions are predators. They relish the smell of fresh blood.
Tadhla: That's right.
Paimon: Ohh... Alright... Paimon will hold her breath anyway!
Tadhla: Do you need more rest or should we set out right now?
Tadhla: It's decently chilly in this lair, our prey's meat should be able to stay overnight and not go bad... We could spend the night here to avoid the cold outside.
Paimon: Sounds good to Paimon! The temperature feels just right in here. Let's all just get some good rest for the night!
Liloupar: It appears that the little one desires to be slothful again.
Paimon: Hmph, Paimon knows when she feels cold and tired! Not everyone is immune to temperature changes like you!
Black Screen Text: Tadhla fetches some desert poplar branches and dried feces. Soon, a simple campfire is built.
Sitting and bathing in its warm light, you all share filling quantities of food and water with each other.
Watching the campfire dancing and crackling, you find yourselves absent of any topics to discuss...
Traveler: Uh... I'll pass.
Tadhla: Suit yourselves.
Black Screen Text: Tadhla dissects the prey with great proficiency and wraps it up in a package.

## Talk 13

Tadhla: You're back.
Traveler: Let's go and continue the hunt.
Tadhla: I'll lead the way. Please follow me.
Traveler: I have some other things to do.
Tadhla: Suit yourselves.

## Talk 14

Tadhla: ...
Traveler: About Masseira...
Tadhla: He is my father. I am his "Falcon."
Traveler: ...
Tadhla: ...
Tadhla: Did you rest well? Are we ready to go?
Traveler: Let's go and continue the hunt.
Tadhla: Please follow me.
Traveler: I have some other things to do. I'll be back later.
Tadhla: Suit yourselves.
Traveler: And...?
Tadhla: Talking the talk is the doings of parrots. Falcons only walk the walk.
Traveler: About you...
Tadhla: About me...?
Tadhla: There's nothing much to say about me... Are you sure you want to know more about me?
Traveler: Is that so strange?
Tadhla: I am a Falcon. I am only allowed to learn about my prey, not any other way around.
Tadhla: So... I am sorry, but I will not betray myself to you.
Liloupar: Be that so? Some advice to you, child: Think for yourself.
Traveler: I want to know what kind of person I am working with.
Tadhla: "Person"? No. A "Falcon"? Yes.
Tadhla: Please rest assured. I will not disobey you or leave you behind. It is Father who entrusted me to you.
Liloupar: Heh... A blind-folded Falcon. In what world would she care about how beautiful she is?

## Talk 15

Tadhla: Here we are.
Tadhla: Scorpions are only active under the veil of night. There is still some time before the night falls. Why don't we plan how we hunt the Scorpion?
Tadhla: First option, we can mix the secretions of Sand Grease Pupa with a few ground poisonous mushrooms. Secretions of Sand Grease Pupa should lure the Scorpion to take the bait, then ground poisonous mushrooms can paralyze the Scorpion.
Tadhla: The toxin is not strong enough to kill it, but would very well suffice to immobilize it.
Tadhla: Or, we can mash up a mixture of Henna Berries and viper venom. Then make some poisonous bait by adding fresh meat into the mush. We fight fire with fire.
Tadhla: But viper venom is a rare resource. It'll be a huge waste to use it all for the bait... I'll adjust the portions to make sure the bait is just poisonous enough to weaken the Scorpion but not kill it.
Tadhla: There's also a third method... Not a clever one though. We risk our lives to hunt it down without any of preparation.
Tadhla: But this method has its merits, too. It avoids any contamination so that we can extract the purest Scorpion venom.
Tadhla: I'll leave the final choice to you. Please take your time.
Tadhla: Oh, one more thing. When fighting with the Scorpion, we must be very careful. Its toxin can be lethal.
Traveler: Let's use the paralyzing poisonous bait.
Tadhla: Very well... Are there any cuts or scratches on your hands?
Black Screen Text: Tadhla prepares the poisonous bait carefully as you wait patiently in the cave until the moon rises...
Tadhla: It's working. Let's go!
Traveler: Let's use the viper venom bait.
Tadhla: Be careful and don't cut yourself. It'll be a disaster if viper venom gets into your body.
Black Screen Text: Tadhla prepares the poisonous bait carefully as you wait patiently in the cave until the moon rises...
Tadhla: It has been weakened. Let's go!
Traveler: I don't need any bait.
Tadhla: Then I will watch your back.

## Talk 16

Tadhla: We need to wait patiently... They should've smelled the blood, but they won't be active before the night falls.

## Talk 17

Tadhla: ...Thank you. You didn't have to do this for me.
Traveler: Are you alright?
Tadhla: I'm fine.
Paimon: You are bleeding...
Tadhla: It's nothing. Just a scratch.
Tadhla: Alright... Next up, dissection.
Traveler: Can I take a look?
Tadhla: ...?
Tadhla: Pfft...
Paimon: Eh? What's so funny?
Liloupar: Pretty uncommon for a Falcon, I would say.
Tadhla: It's just... It's kind of funny when you suddenly asked to see how I dissect the Scorpion.
Tadhla: I barely know anyone else who is as interested in taking apart prey as you are. Or are you interested in this for some other reason?
Traveler: I'm just worried that your hands might shake.
Tadhla: They do not shake when I hunt. Nor will they shake when I harvest my prey.
Tadhla: No need to worry. I am a "Falcon," after all...
Black Screen Text: Tadhla slowly cuts the Scorpion open, harvests its poison glands, and removes the useless organs, and carefully wraps them up in separate packages.
While doing this, her hands are nimble and steady, as if playing a soundless musical instrument that is made of blood and chitin.
...It is only a short while before she finishes the dissection.
Black Screen Text: After all this work, Tadhla lets out a long breath.
Her forehead is dotted with tiny beads of sweat, her breaths tremulous... Her fresh wound must really hurt.
Tadhla: See? It's just a scratch. For a Falcon, it's nothing to worry about.
Tadhla: Alright, we still need to hunt the Flying Serpent. Let's go.
Traveler: You should take a break.
Tadhla: No... If not preserved properly, the poison glands will spoil in the air and become useless.
Black Screen Text: Tadhla harvests the Scorpion with ease, removing its poison glands and useless organs, then carefully wraps them up in separate packages.
After that, she shows you her stained hands without a change of expression on her face. Somehow you feel that she is trying to prove something to you...
Traveler: Are you hurt?
Tadhla: No... Um... Just a little bit, but it doesn't matter.
Paimon: Don't push yourself too hard.
Tadhla: I won't. Thank you, Paimon.

## Talk 18

Liloupar: Wait... I feel it... The familiar... pain.
Liloupar: It is my soul, my fragments... One is around here...
Tadhla: This place is a habitat for flying serpents. Seems this oasis is powered by one of the Jinni's fragments and has become an ecosystem for them...
Liloupar: That's right. Uh... No, I can't sense the fragment due to the interference of the flying serpents here. Their scents are too thick, too pungent...
Paimon: Then let's go deep and take them down!
Tadhla: Yes...
Liloupar: I guess you wanted to say "Let's go!" but you'd better stand down and take a break.
Tadhla: ...I'll check the Flying Serpent up ahead.
Tadhla: ...
Paimon: Tadhla! Are you alright?
Tadhla: *pant* Yes...
Liloupar: She means to say that "It hurts."
Tadhla: I... Do not...
Traveler: It's okay. Let me do it.
Paimon: Yes, you should get some rest!
Tadhla: ...
Traveler: Leave the rest to me.
Paimon: #Yes, from now on, you can totally count on us! Umm, Paimon means you can totally count on {NICKNAME}!
Tadhla: ...

## Talk 19

Tadhla: Sorry for not being helpful...
Paimon: Don't say that, you deserve some rest! There's nothing wrong with us helping out when you're not feeling so well. We're friends after all!
Tadhla: I am but a Falcon of Masseira's.
Traveler: And a friend of ours.
Tadhla: ...
Tadhla: Fine.
Liloupar: Ah... Pardon me, my master, but I... sense my fragment nearby.
Tadhla: ...It's okay. I'll go take care of our prey.
Traveler: We see you only as our friend.
Tadhla: ...
Tadhla: Thank you.

## Talk 20

Black Screen Text: As the shard of light merges with Liloupar's magic bottle, you feel a little of your own power being pulled away...
Black Screen Text: Through the Jinni's entranced eyes, you see a vortex of decay and betrayal...
The Spirit of Victory fell into madness due to a signet ring most dark, and in a series of tragedies, Queen Shirin brewed the honey-colored catastrophe before her mind yielded to hysteria...
The people turned against each other, and the Jinn scattered across the lands... Broken souls became fuel to a titanic machine, and the mindless descendants of the Seelie were degraded into slaves of infinite power...
Black Screen Text: Then, the merciless era of the Spirit of Victory began... The crazed king and the nobles rejoiced in their superiority...
Yet none were aware that all the happenings within Gurabad were created by the scheming hands of the Mother of the Jinn...
Liloupar: My master, are you feeling alright?
Traveler: It's... Gurabad. Again...
Liloupar: Apologies. Experiencing a Jinni's memories is not necessarily always a pleasant experience.
Traveler: Liloupar, what have you done...
Liloupar: What have I done? You should see what they have done... With just a nudge, they would have cast themselves down the vile path toward certain ruination.
Liloupar: The fall of Gurabad... is just a prologue. I merely revealed what torments await.
Liloupar: Alright, now is not the time for such a topic... Your friends are waiting for you to wake up.
Paimon: Are you awake? Can you not always scare Paimon to death!?
Tadhla: Oh, you are finally awake. Paimon was so worried about you...
Paimon: So was Tadhla! When you fell unconscious, she was really nervous and almost cried! Paimon thinks you owe Tadhla an apology!
Tadhla: I was not...
Traveler: I didn't mean to make you worry, Tadhla. I'm sorry.
Tadhla: ...
Tadhla: A hunter does not apologize to a Falcon.
Traveler: How is your wound now?
Tadhla: Hmm... It's been better. Let's head back.
Liloupar: She's shaking, as if having a fever... It's the Scorpion's toxin. I know it well.
Liloupar: It is not lethal. But the effects are still deleterious in pain and harm... She will need to rest.
Tadhla: No need. I'm okay.
Liloupar: For now, perhaps. Yet, time is like a fraying blade in the desert. Soon, the toxins and the heat will unite against your flesh, inflicting dehydration, and drawing you closer to the rapids of demise.
Tadhla: ...
Liloupar: A good Falcon knows to cherish their life. Or they will become a burden and be eliminated. Be you a foolish Falcon, child?
Tadhla: ...
Paimon: That's enough, Liloupar. Don't be so harsh to her! And Tadhla, stop treating yourself this way... We really should get some rest before we go!
Traveler: Liloupar has a point.
Tadhla: Ah... I'm sorry.
Paimon: There is no need to apologize! This cave should be able to block out the cold winds at night. Let's set up a campfire right here!
Tadhla: Good idea... Let me help... *grunt*
Paimon: Don't worry, we got this. We're experts when it comes to building a campfire!
Black Screen Text: You build a simple campfire and cook some food together with Paimon.
Tadhla drinks some water and falls asleep soon...
Her body is mildly over-warm. Under the influence of the dehydration and fatigue inflicted by the Scorpion's venom, Tadhla sinks into a deep slumber. You can tell that the pain is wearing off on her...
Black Screen Text: After some time, the morning sun lights up the scarlet desert...
The sun is up, and you all wake up as the morning dew dries up in sunlight's heat.
Tadhla: Time to get up. Let's go.
Paimon: You look a lot better, Tadhla. How are you feeling?
Tadhla: I'm feeling much better now... Come on, let's go.
Liloupar: Pretty soon the day will be searing hot under the sun. If we want to return to the tribe safe and sound, we need to go now.
Traveler: Paimon's right.
Traveler: Please don't push yourself too hard.
Tadhla: It's nothing.
Traveler: My head really hurts...

## Talk 21

Masseira: Ah, esteemed master of the Jinni! And eh... Hmm. I see you have both returned.
Traveler: (Hand over the prey)

## Talk 22

Tadhla: We are back. This is the prey you asked for.
Masseira: A little later than I expected. What happened, my little Falcon?
Tadhla: It's embarrassing to say. I... I got injured. But thanks to the Master of the Jinni, I'm okay now.
Masseira: ...
Masseira: Good, very good. It's good to see you're alright.
Masseira: Esteemed Master of the Jinni, did my Falcon hold you back?
Traveler: Tadhla has done me a big favor.
Masseira: Is that so...
Masseira: Very well. Thank you very much.
Masseira: But... Falcons belong to hunters, not the earth. Once Falcons get attached to the world, their senses and claws will be dull. If that happens, how can I expect them to hunt for me?
Paimon: That doesn't make any sense to Paimon... But hearing you going on and on about Falcons surely makes Paimon irritated!
Paimon: Tadhla is human, and our friend! Not some sort of so-called "Falcon"!
Masseira: "Friend," huh?
Tadhla: No... It's not like that...
Masseira: I will deal with you later.
Masseira: Haha, please, don't get me wrong! I am most happy that my little Falcon has made some new friends! Truly, I am.
Masseira: Here, this is your payment. Please do come find me later. I'll probably have other commissions for you.
Tadhla: ...
Masseira: ...
Masseira: My little Falcon, let's talk about your next "hunt," shall we?
Traveler: We had a great time.
Masseira: Oh, a great time?
Masseira: Very well. Thank you very much.
Traveler: Please do not have such doubts. Tadhla is extremely capable.
Masseira: I know that, of course. She's my Falcon, after all.

## Talk 23

Tadhla: I can smell the lair. Yes, it is right there.
Tadhla: Well then, let's go.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Masseira: Ah, the distinguished Master of the Jinni. If you are here for Tadhla, it might not be a convenient time.
Traveler: About Tadhla...
Masseira: I am her Father, she is my Falcon. Although she is not the only Falcon that has grown up under my tutelage, she is the one that I trust the most.
Masseira: Trust is invaluable. It is something that concerns life and death in this tribe.
Traveler: About you...
Masseira: I am a hunter in the tribe, but I'm getting old and not as strong and agile as before... In time, your friend Jeht will take the place of old timers like me.
Masseira: So, I have high hopes for Tadhla. When the day comes that I have to retire, I need to have at least one Falcon that I can trust.
Traveler: About the tribe...
Masseira: Tanit is our tribe, our home.
Masseira: In the desert, no one can survive without the protection of the tribe. Also, if the tribe needs to take someone's life, how can they escape under the omnipresence of the "eyes" and "claws" of our Falcons?
Traveler: Bye.
Masseira: May patterns on the sand dunes guide your way, esteemed Master of the Jinni.

### Additional Talk 2

Tadhla: Did you finish dealing with the Jinn matter?
Traveler: Not yet...
Tadhla: Please don't worry about me. I'm still busy with something...
Traveler: How is your wound? Is it getting better?
Tadhla: Yes, it doesn't hurt anymore. *grunt* It's okay now.

### Additional Talk 3

Tadhla: Hello, the Master of the Jinni.
Traveler: How is your wound? Is it getting better?
Tadhla: Nothing to worry about. No need to worry about me.
Traveler: Bye.
Tadhla: Goodbye.
