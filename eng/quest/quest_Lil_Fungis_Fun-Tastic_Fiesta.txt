# Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta!


## Talk 1

Paimon: Huh? Is there something wrong with Paimon's eyes?
Paimon: Just now... That thing which floated off ahead... was that a Fungus? Have Fungi invaded Fontaine?
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, let's go check it out!

## Talk 2

Turenna: Thank you for your cooperation. The review has been completed, and your companions are all very safe. They are of no threat to Fontaine's citizens and ecological environment.
Turenna: As stated in the Fontaine Foreign Species Management Act and the Quartier Lyonnais Code of Business Conduct, you may proceed with your event.
Haniyyah: Thank you, Ms. Turenna.
Haniyyah: I didn't think hosting an event in Fontaine would be this complicated. It took around ten extra steps as compared to procedures at Port Ormos. I guess my preparations weren't sufficient...
Turenna: Don't mention it, and don't beat yourself up about it. You and your Fungi companions are special guests.
Turenna: The Maison Gardiennage rarely comes into contact with foreign Fungi species, so proceeding with caution was necessary. It is only normal that the observation and evaluation took quite a bit of time.
Turenna: Next, I shall be transferring your commission to the other Gardes.
Turenna: If the rumored Golden Comet and Silver Companion are spotted, the Gardes will notify them and ask them to meet you here...
Turenna: I hope your "Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta" goes smoothly, and you have a great time in the Court of Fontaine... If you need anything, just call for me, and I'll be there.
Haniyyah: Ah, it seems that won't be necessary anymore. They are already here.
Turenna: Wait a minute! By "Golden Comet and Silver Companion"... You refer to these... Super Zenith Boss-Level Forces?
Paimon: Whoa! How did we suddenly become the topic of your conversation? And what's with those strange names...
Haniyyah: You two are the same as ever, I see... Energetic, spirited, and with a reassuring air about you.
Traveler: Who are you?
Paimon: Wh—Wh—Who are you? Have we met?
Haniyyah: Hmm... Your failure to remember me is my mistake. I should have done my best to maintain contact and sent a few more letters.
Haniyyah: A long time ago, the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament was held in Sumeru. I participated with some prejudiced thoughts and the intent to do something dangerous...
Haniyyah: You woke me up and made me change. You helped me stop hating my kind, Fungi buddies and seek the right path toward coexisting with them.
Haniyyah: After the event, you became the ultimate decision-maker of the tournament, and I promised that I would do my best to continue running the event...
Paimon: Are you... Haniyyah? The same Haniyyah who's been taking care of Bongo-Head and the other Fungi for us?
Haniyyah: Yeah, that's me! Long time no see, Golden Comet, Silver Companion!
Traveler: Your new outfit is gorgeous!
Paimon: Your new look's made you completely unrecognizable! You've changed so... Well, too much! Even the way you speak has changed!
Paimon: Uh, is this some way of... making your trip to Fontaine with your Fungi buddies... special?
Turenna: Ahem! Actually, the Court of Fontaine does not impose a dress code on its visitors. You'd be welcomed warmly here even if you were wearing a plain hunter's outfit...
Turenna: And the way Ms. Haniyyah dresses is much more than just following a dress code, I'd say it's elegant, extremely elegant!
Haniyyah: Thank you so much! Your affirmation fills me with greater confidence.
Haniyyah: Anyway, I'm here in Fontaine to search for reliable investors for the official Fungi tournament, and to host a preview event to advertise the Fungi's cuteness and attract an audience in advance.
Haniyyah: According to Souka, we are conducting transnational business, and Fontainians are very particular about their dress. So, when in Fontaine, do as Fontainians do.
Haniyyah: She prepared my preview event plans, ordered this costume for me, and even gave me special training to improve the way I carry myself.
Paimon: Souka? Isn't that the light novelist who's been following you to gather material and helping you take care of the Fungi after being defeated by us?
Paimon: Paimon didn't expect her to be so well-versed in... foreign etiquette! Was she that knowledgeable!?
Haniyyah: And if you still remember the tabletop game, Fungus Mechanicus, then you can give the brand-new Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta a try.
Haniyyah: In Fungus Mechanicus, you'd direct your Fungi to defeat all the Mechanici.
Haniyyah: The game received a pretty good initial response, but it was lacking in long-term potential, so it quickly lost popularity...
Haniyyah: As such, Souka combined elements from various documents and fiction to change the Mechanici into pieces that simulate powerful opponents, which adds all manner of variables to the game.
Haniyyah: Souka is at the Steambird's office right now discussing the game's marketing plan.
Paimon: Paimon sorta gets it now... So the preview event, Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta, is this tabletop game?
Paimon: And powerful opponents, you say? Does that mean we'll be commanding Fungi pieces to clash with other creatures, and that both sides can move?
Paimon: The game sounds much more complicated now... But based on past experience, Paimon's sure you still have some details to iron out and perfect, right?
Traveler: Haha! That's right up our alley!
Turenna: Ahem... There's no need to worry. We've resolved all the issues in advance.
Turenna: Miss Haniyyah and her Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta have received the Fontaine Research Institute's... Uh... What was it again? The sponsorship of the Fonta project team, so everything is ready.
Turenna: Even if something is left unfinished, I... Turenna, the most diligent member of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, would never allow it to trouble you, our distinguished guests!
Turenna: You're Super Zenith Boss-Level Forces after all, and Miss Haniyyah is an important foreign merchant, so you can just leave any odd jobs to ordinary Gardes!
Paimon: O—Oh, so you're one of the Gardes! Paimon thought you were an assistant Haniyyah hired... You're so reliable!
Traveler: My apologies.
Turenna: Heh! A Super Zenith Boss-Level Force recognized me... I've been acknowledged by an apex warrior!
Turenna: Ahem! I might be getting a bit carried away...
Turenna: As a newbie in the Special Patrol, I'm obligated to monitor foreign creatures, provide the highest levels of assistance to special guests, and resolve issues that are beyond the ability of ordinary Gardes.
Turenna: If Fungi-related events can bring considerable economic benefit to the Court of Fontaine... Then I would be considered to have accumulated experience that goes beyond combat, and our captain would value me more...
Paimon: Oh, don't be so serious! It's just a game! Relax!
Paimon: In Paimon's opinion, anything linked to Fungi tends to help people forget their troubles and be happy!
Haniyyah: In that case, I happen to have a suggestion.
Haniyyah: Souka and I have tried "Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta" several hundred times, but we represent only two types of players, whereas the guests have the most diverse mentalities.
Haniyyah: As it happens, the two of you have very unique personalities and experiences, and Ms. Turenna is also a most responsible person...
Haniyyah: So if the two of you were to play a few matches, we should be able to discover many in-game limitations, and that will help with further improvements.
Traveler: Alright! Time for a new game!
Turenna: Since even the Super Zenith Boss-Level Forces are absolutely interested, and this will make an excellent feather in my resume cap... Of course I'd be happy to help!
Turenna: But I'm well aware that I'm inferior to you in all aspects, so please go easy on me!
Traveler: I was planning on giving it a try anyway!
Traveler: Thank you so much!
Traveler: Is there anything we can help you with?
Traveler: And you're so well-spoken now!
Traveler: I believe we've met before, yes?
Paimon: That voice sure is familiar, but, uh, did we know a lady like her?
Paimon: Based on your slightly tanned skin, you're not from around here, huh?
Paimon: Wait! Paimon kinda remembers now! This is kinda unbelievable, but...

## Talk 3

Turenna: Strong... Too strong... Even if it's just a tabletop game, you're still practically invulnerable!
Turenna: P—Please go a few more rounds with me and teach me more!
Traveler: Am I really that good?
Paimon: That's a little too much, don't you think? We're just playing a game.
Turenna: Please don't try to be humble! This tabletop game can reflect a player's ability to command...
Turenna: The positioning of each Lil' Fungus, their opponent, skill activation rhythm, support timings... Everything is important!
Turenna: You haven't received any command training from the Maison Gardiennage, and yet you're still able to launch joint attacks so skillfully...
Turenna: You're not just a Super Zenith Boss-Level Force, you're a real Super Zenith Boss!
Turenna: Are you interested in taking up a position in the Maison? I'm sure you'd become a captain in no time, and then advance further still into one of the organization's pillars...
Traveler: Alright! What's the pay like?
Turenna: Um... About that... I'm not very sure. I remember that the monthly salary of ordinary Gardes used to be 300,000 Mora a few years ago... I guess it might've risen slightly by now?
Paimon: How much is 300,000 Mora per month? It sounds like quite a familiar number to Paimon...
Traveler: That won't even feed Paimon!
Turenna: I—It can't be helped! The Maison is an executive agency funded by tax money, so of course the pay wouldn't be that high...
Haniyyah: I understand the respect you feel for them, Ms. Turenna.
Haniyyah: Unfortunately, from what I know, they plan on traveling around Teyvat while helping people from all nations to resolve their problems and eliminate monsters...
Haniyyah: As a recipient of their kindness, I too hope that more shall be able to receive their help.
Turenna: I see...
Turenna: Sowing the seeds of justice and peace throughout Teyvat is indeed more important than merely maintaining order in Fontaine!
Turenna: Then all I can do is... go a few more rounds with you and do my best to understand your way of thinking!
Paimon: Anyway, there's something important we can't forget, Haniyyah...
Haniyyah: You want to know how Bongo-Head's doing, right?
Haniyyah: Bongo-Head and Kindlejoy are right over there. Ms. Turenna even specially arranged for someone to take care of our Fungi buddies.
Haniyyah: As before, I've prepared special jellies this time too.
Haniyyah: You can play with them while enjoying some snacks together!
Paimon: Alright! That's what Paimon's talking about! You really are getting better at this, Haniyyah!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, let's each play a round of Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta with Turenna, and then we'll go see Bongo-Head!
Traveler: Come now, am I not worth millions?
Traveler: Ugh! I don't want to go to work!
Paimon: #Yeah, and settling down and working from a fixed location will keep {NICKNAME} from doing what {M#he}{F#she} needs to do.
Paimon: Paimon doesn't want to be woken up early in the morning and made to work either... It's best to stay free and go wherever our feet might take us.
Traveler: And there will be more choices for our daily meals.
Paimon: Yeah! Delicious food matters too! Settling down means getting bored of the food sooner or later! Changing menus from time to time is the best!
Traveler: And we will have a greater variety of food to enjoy.
Traveler: Flattery won't get you anywhere.

## Talk 4

Haniyyah: I knew it! Your strategy was outstanding in the Nilotpala Cup and Fungus Mechanicus, and it's extraordinary here, too! I suppose I should bring my A-game!
Traveler: Play another round of Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta.
Haniyyah: No problem! You may find yourself pleasantly surprised if you try mixing and matching different Lil' Fungi.
Traveler: Your A-game?
Haniyyah: Ahem! Anyway, Boss Golden Comet, Silver Companion! What do you think of Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta?
Traveler: Stop being so formal! We're friends, you know?
Paimon: Yeah! We're friends! Saying that makes it feel like we're superior and subordinate, and that creates... that, y'know... sense of distance!
Haniyyah: My concern is that publicly, I'm an employee of the Beast Tamers Tournament's organizer, and the two of you are our highest-level decision-makers.
Haniyyah: According to "500 Things You Need to Know When Organizing a Big Event", attention should always be paid to etiquette and rules, so, using the correct method of address is important as well.
Haniyyah: I may need to take up some of your time later to meet with our sponsors and discuss the event.
Haniyyah: Like our sponsor this time, the Fonta project team.
Traveler: I guess I can be the boss for a while...
Paimon: But we know nothing about business talk. They may see through our lack of experience if we're present...
Paimon: "These two so-called bosses are complete amateurs! The deals we offer don't have to be that good!"
Paimon: And we won't be able to refute it, so it'll make everything absolutely embarrassing...
Paimon: In that way, we'd actually be creating trouble for you, Haniyyah!
Haniyyah: That makes sense... Hmm, I never considered this possibility.
Haniyyah: I see. When it comes to dealing with people, it seems I'm still lacking in experience when compared to you.
Haniyyah: I should use this term of address carefully from now on then... No, I should give more consideration to how I deal with non-mercenaries!
Traveler: Not only that, the boss takes all the blame...
Haniyyah: The blame? Do you mean... If they think our event didn't perform well, they might blame everything on the highest-level decision makers?
Paimon: Yeah... Or maybe, our title of "boss" and our reputation will put the spotlight, and thus any blame that must be laid, on us.
Paimon: Even if we get a chance to explain ourselves, it'll definitely take a lot of time.
Traveler: We're more concerned about how you're doing, really...
Paimon: Yeah! Haniyyah, we haven't seen each other in a long time, and you've... changed so much! You must have gone through a lot!
Haniyyah: Me? I think I've been living quite peacefully, in truth.
Haniyyah: Souka taught me a lot about vocabulary and grammar after I returned from Port Ormos, and that helped me get through numerous books.
Haniyyah: I think my level of knowledge should barely meet the standards of... the lowest level of students?
Haniyyah: In return, I helped Souka with physical training, and taught her more rainforest survival and combat skills.
Haniyyah: Maybe it was her keen interest in mercenaries that kept her spirits high at all times, but I took her to meet some of my old mercenary friends, and it didn't take long for her to hit it off with them.
Haniyyah: What really surprised me was how we encountered some monsters on the way back...
Haniyyah: ...Only for Souka to leap forward and took them down with a few swings of her axe! She's got a real gift!
Traveler: Guess we look forward to you entering the Akademiya soon, huh?
Paimon: Yeah! Right! Paimon's sure you'll make it, what with all the books you've been reading!
Haniyyah: Not at all! I don't need a degree. I'm satisfied with taking care of my Fungi buddies...
Haniyyah: Anyway, we appreciate your concern. We've been living life to the fullest lately!
Traveler: We can look forward to Souka's masterpiece soon, methinks!
Paimon: Huh, but she seemed so weak before! Paimon can't imagine how she's gotten this good at fighting!
Paimon: As a writer who has personally experienced the Beast Tamers Tournament, rainforest survival, and adventure as a mercenary... A story written by Souka would certainly be special!
Traveler: Let's talk about our Fungi buddies, shall we?
Haniyyah: Relax, Golden Comet!
Haniyyah: Souka and I stocked up on a bunch of supplies in Port Ormos, expanded the camp, and obtained jellies with improved flavors.
Haniyyah: Bongo-Head and the others are well-fed, and even if they don't go outside their camp, they have climbing walls, swings, and seesaws to keep them from feeling bored.
Haniyyah: And when they go outside, the fungi get along well with the Shroomboars, Dusk Birds, and Sumpter Beasts. Sometimes, they even go for walks on the Sumpter Beasts.
Paimon: Heh, Paimon almost feels like joining them now!
Haniyyah: However, Ms. Najah, who is responsible for improving the Wisdom Orb, has encountered a problem and seems intent on taking the technology in a different direction.
Haniyyah: The development of a new Orb is experiencing a huge lack of funding too, so it will be impossible to complete it at the expected rate.
Traveler: Some delays are understandable.
Paimon: Hmm... Yeah, we really can't be careless with it, so it can't be helped if it's slow going... If only Paimon knew how to conduct research! Then she'd at least be able to help!
Haniyyah: Besides searching for reliable sponsors and promoting the event in advance, I came to Fontaine with the goal of finding technicians skilled in this field.
Haniyyah: Fortunately, the Fontaine Research Institute's Fonta research team didn't just provide a huge amount of funding to us, but they also promised to help us look for the necessary talent.
Traveler: And what's the catch?
Paimon: Paimon's still kinda worried. Did those guys who invented Fonta really not ask anything of you?
Haniyyah: Of course they did. They asked for naming rights and to be the sole supplier.
Haniyyah: As such, the next Beast Tamers Tournament might not be the Nilotpala Cup but the Fonta Cup instead. The exact name is still under discussion.
Haniyyah: All beverages sold by the organizer during the event must be swapped to Fonta or Fonta derivatives as well.
Paimon: Well... That doesn't sound too bad?
Paimon: It sounds like they're just trying to promote Fonta through the Beast Tamers Tournament...
Paimon: Wait a minute! If we're talking fame, then we're the ones who stand to gain from this! So it seems like we're the biggest winner, no matter how you look at it!
Traveler: There aren't any competing products right now, either!
Paimon: Indeed! We've won the Fungi important funding without losing anything! It would be a waste to let this opportunity slip by!
Haniyyah: I've carefully verified everything with Souka and Mr. Balfour too. There are no traps in the previous contract. Which is good, since I hope to do this well!
Paimon: Hehe, after hearing that detailed explanation from you, Haniyyah, Paimon thinks the future is looking really good!
Paimon: Maybe your trip to Fontaine will be the stepping stone to many great things.
Haniyyah: Thanks for the kind words, Silver Companion!
Traveler: Let's make the new sponsors engage in bidding in the future!
Haniyyah: Bidding? Do you mean making any new sponsors engage in bidding against the Fonta project team for the naming rights?
Paimon: #We can do that? {NICKNAME}, how are you always so full of great ideas?
Traveler: There's no such thing as free fried eggs in this world...
Traveler: It's an very important device, after all.
Traveler: See you later!
Haniyyah: Sure, seems you two are busy.
Haniyyah: Don't worry, I'll be staying here for some time, so feel free to come back if you want to catch up or play another round of Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta!
