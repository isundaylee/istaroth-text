# Delicious Eight-Treasure Duck

A dish that needs true skill to make. The plump and juicy lucky duck is irresistible as soon as it's out of the pot. Add fragrant gravy and a touch of rosy gloss, and this can be said to be the perfect combination of color, flavor, and shape, every bite a veritable flood of flavor with an enduring aftertaste.
