# Talk Dialog

Ematol: Hmm. Perhaps for stability, tail fins might... Oh, hello there, Honorary Knight! 7th Company's Weapons Officer, Ematol, reporting for duty! What orders do you bring?
Traveler: Well, what are you doing?
Ematol: Reporting in! As per normal, I am working on new bomb structures! And... as per Phonia's request, I am "wargaming in silence, so as to spare her ears the damage"!
Traveler: Err, the structure of bombs, you say...?
Ematol: That's right! I mean, you must have seen the Spark Knight's lovely, gorgeous Jumpy Dumpties too, yes?
Ematol: Though I, Ematol, am just a lowly, bog-standard alchemist of no significance, I still have a dream!
Ematol: Not to delve into the structures of gold-mercury amalgams, but to achieve even a twentieth of the might bestowed upon Jumpy Dumpties by their construction!
Ematol: And that's why I've been working on an all-new design! Explosive speed — perfected! Shockwaves — shattering! Craftsmanship — simple. Cost... reasonable... Ah, I get the shivers just thinking about it...
Ematol: ...Ah, uh, sorry. Got carried away again, didn't I? Anyway, if there are any bombs... I mean, any things I can do for you, please let me know, Honorary Knight!
Traveler: Alright. I shan't disturb you, then...
Ematol: Oh, no worries, no worries! You just take care, Honorary Knight!
Traveler: Did you gain anything useful from the simulations?
Ematol: Reporting in, Honorary Knight! I've calibrated the explosion radii of several types of bombs, and tested their effects in simulated environments! I... guess that counts, right?
Ematol: And like I said earlier, it would be ideal if we could also increase our real explosion parameters by ten times!
Ematol: I mean, I've not got the brains for complex tactics, so I'll just focus on my explosives research, you know?
Traveler: It's fine, continue as you were.
Ematol: Oh, no worries, no worries! You just take care, Honorary Knight!
