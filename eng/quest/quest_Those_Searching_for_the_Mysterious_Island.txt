# Those Searching for the Mysterious Island


## Talk 1

Black Screen Text: The defeated Koholasaurs scatter and run away.
Paimon: Judging from your clothes, you must be scholars from Sumeru, right?
Karya: Yes, I'm Karya, and this is my senior, Viramdra. Thank you so much for saving us. That was a little too close...
Paimon: #Don't mention it! Handling these sort of things is practically second nature to us by now. Paimon is Paimon, and this is {NICKNAME}!
Viramdra: *sigh* Still, it seems that all the Koholasaurs just ran off... We need to capture at least one alive.
Paimon: Huh? Capture one alive?
Viramdra: Correct. Say, I can see you are very skilled at dealing with them. Do you think you could use me as live bait to help us capture one? I will pay you for the effort!
Paimon: Um, well...
Karya: Apologies. Viramdra has been hyper-focused on his research, so please, don't be too hard on him...
Paimon: Oh, no worries! But why did you approach a whole group of wild Koholasaurs? And what's this talk about "capturing them"?
Traveler: Don't tell me you want to get a picture with them, too.
Paimon: Paimon's pretty sure that's not what they're trying to do!
Karya: I'm sure we must look very silly... The fact of the matter is that we're searching for a mysterious island from a certain legend. It's said that a very important clue about the island can be found on Koholasaurs, so...
Karya: Approaching them without the help of a guide from the People of the Springs was certainly an unwise choice on our part.
Paimon: A mysterious island?
Karya: Yes. There's a legend from the People of the Springs that mentions a mysterious island, and Viramdra believes the key to his research can be found there.
Viramdra: Ahem... Are you certain you two won't consider my proposal to capture one?
Paimon: Some proposal... There's no way we'd be willing to use a person as live bait!
Viramdra: Then I suppose discussing it any further will just be a waste of time. I must come up with another solution...
Karya: Ahem... Viramdra!
Viramdra: Oh, alright... You did rescue Karya and I just now, and I suppose I should express some gratitude. Thank you very much.
Paimon: A little awkward, but Paimon'll take it...
Viramdra: We should move on, Karya.
Karya: Yes, thank you again. My apologies... Viramdra really doesn't have the best people skills.
Paimon: That's alright, bye now!
Paimon: You really don't see a pair of adventurers like those two every day!
Paimon: But anyway, Paimon's really curious about that mysterious island that lady just mentioned!
Traveler: Do you wanna find the island too, Paimon?
Paimon: Yeah! Who knows, there might be treasure!
Paimon: After all the amazing places we've explored during our adventures, finding some mysterious island should be a walk in the park for us!
Traveler: But we don't have any info about this island.
Paimon: Ah, you're right... The lady mentioned that the mysterious island is related to a legend of the People of the Springs... So maybe we can start by asking some of them about it?
Paimon: Time's ticking. Let's get started on our next adventure!
Paimon: But the real question is... who should we ask?
Traveler: Can we just talk to the chief?
Paimon: Hmm... that's an idea. If anyone, the chief of the tribe should know the details!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Wow, what an amazing view! And we can even see some Koholasaurs here and there! Hey, why don't we try to get a picture with one or two of them in the wild?
Traveler: But what if they try to bite us?
Paimon: Well... they're so cute, they probably won't do that, right...?
Paimon: Huh? What's happening over there?
Karya: Help! Somebody help us!
Paimon: Ah! Wild Koholasaurs are actually biting people!
Traveler: It's time for us to save the day again!
Paimon: #Yeah, those two are in trouble! The legendary {NICKNAME} and {M#his}{F#her} trusty sidekick Paimon will not stand by idly!
Traveler: Seems those pictures we wanted will have to wait.
Paimon: Yeah, we can save those for later! We can't just stand around when someone's calling for help!
