Traveler: Um, hello?
Affan: ...Another merchant here to sell their wares, are you? Ugh, how many does this make...
Affan: Not that it matters. I do not lack for food or clothing, nor do I have any savings. Whatever you're selling, go sell it to someone else.
Affan: I've got flowers to plant, as you can see. If you're not here about that, don't disturb me.
