## Talk 2

Paimon: Just where are you running to, Benoit?
Benoit Leroy: The house was hers anyway, so if she takes it back, then she takes it back. It's fine...
Benoit Leroy: If I lose my life... No, I can't lose it... Here, still, I...
Paimon: Benoit! We almost couldn't keep up! ...Why did you suddenly start running so fast?
Morticia: When the flow combs...
Morticia: The cradle will rock...
Morticia: If the stem breaks, the cradle will fall...
Morticia: Yet I will catch you, cradle and all...

## Talk 4

Traveler: Let them take care of it. I won't interfere.
Benoit Leroy: Oh, my dear Autumn, do you really want to do this to me?
Benoit Leroy: What child of the Fleuve Cendre was as lucky as you? The sweets you ate, your satin dresses, the novels you adored, all of those required money.
Benoit Leroy: While others shuddered and starved, you were wearing pretty dresses and putting necklaces on your dog.
Benoit Leroy: I gave you that life, so don't you think I should get some kind of reward? After all, there's no such thing as a free ride.
Benoit Leroy: Me, cruel to you? I have been generous enough!
Benoit Leroy: Autumn, think back carefully. What part of your life did I not prepare for you? Every time you went astray and met with misfortune, it was due to your own willful decisions.
Athos: Ah, Mr. Benoit, you simply are amazing at twisting words until the logic itself is completely inverted. Proclaiming generosity and kindness while only seeking to further your selfish ends. In the end, it's all about you, isn't it?
Morticia: Your so-called kindness was only an attempt to fatten me up like a lamb for the slaughter. Spare me your lies.
Morticia: The extent of my compassion and pity for you now is to give you a quick death. But before that, tell me, where is my child?
Morticia: Whether at the old home, or the house you live in now, there isn't a trace of her or her whereabouts. Just where did you send her?
Benoit Leroy: If I tell you, will you let me go?
Morticia: No, but I'll let you die less painfully.
Benoit Leroy: ...If I don't tell you, I die. If I tell you, I die anyway. Heh, if there's nothing in it for me, then why should I make things easy for you?
Athos: *sigh* ...Autumn, you really never do tell a lie, do you? Now we'll never find out where she went.
Benoit Leroy: Well, I do happen to know where she is, hehe! But I won't tell you, nope! I'll never tell!
Benoit Leroy: You'll never find her. Never, never, never, never, never...
Morticia: I'm going to take him away. I'll be bringing him back to his own home — do any of you have any objections?
Traveler: Please do. We won't interfere.
Paimon: Y—You guys take care of it yourselves. It's not our business.
Black Screen Text: Benoit keeps repeating "You will never, ever find her" over and over as the silent Autumn takes him away.
Athos: I wasn't planning on letting anyone else know about any of this. After all, she has an arrest warrant out for her. It's probably worth mentioning that I, too, am the subject of such a warrant.
Athos: If you go to the Maison Gardiennage now and file a report, you should be able to pocket a hefty sum.
Athos: But I would advise against doing so. If you do, our friends will not forget. Feel free to find out for yourselves.
Traveler: I won't report anything.
Athos: Haha, that's what I thought you'd say.
Athos: In that case, this Rainbow Rose is for you. We favor this flower on account of its rich symbolism.
Athos: Right now, it symbolizes a warning. A warning not to change your mind about what you just said.
Athos: Farewell.
Paimon: So... That's what happened. What a complicated family!
Paimon: Paimon doesn't know what to say about all of that! It's a good thing we didn't report anything to the Maison Gardiennage earlier.
Paimon: Paimon feels bad for Autumn though, she never managed to find her kid in the end.
Paimon: And Paimon thought Benoit was a nice guy, too! Uh... Do you think Paimon's easy to fool?
Traveler: You're just realizing that now?
Paimon: Hey! That's going too far! Mocking Paimon at a time like this... Hmph! Paimon won't forgive you unless you treat her to a big meal at the Hotel Debord!
Traveler: Your brain cells die lonely deaths.
Traveler: I don't need the money.

## Talk 5

Athos: Ho, looks like we've got trouble.
Benoit Leroy: Thank you, thank you! *sigh* Autumn, I put so much into raising you, yet these outsiders care for me more than you!
Benoit Leroy: What child of the Fleuve Cendre was as lucky as you? The sweets you ate, your satin dresses, the novels you adored, all of those required money.
Benoit Leroy: While others shuddered and starved, you were wearing pretty dresses and putting necklaces on your dog.
Benoit Leroy: I gave you that life, so don't you think I should get some kind of reward? After all, there's no such thing as a free ride.
Benoit Leroy: Me, cruel to you? I have been generous enough!
Benoit Leroy: Autumn, think back carefully. What part of your life did I not prepare for you? Every time you went astray and met with misfortune, it was due to your own willful decisions.
Morticia: The extent of my compassion and pity for you now is to give you a quick death. But before that, tell me, where is my child?
Morticia: Whether at the old home, or the house you live in now, there isn't a trace of her or her whereabouts. Just where did you send her?
Benoit Leroy: If I tell you, will you let me go?
Morticia: No, but I'll let you die less painfully.
Athos: *sigh* ...Autumn, you really never do tell a lie, do you? Now we'll never find out where she went.
Benoit Leroy: Y—You... Don't think you can do whatever you want! There's someone else watching you here, you know!
Athos: You think we care? That we don't dare?
Benoit Leroy: ...Autumn, forget it. Give up. She's living a good life, and her parents are rich. What would you even do if you found her?
Benoit Leroy: Would you make her drift about with you? You're an escapee from Meropide! Do you want her to live like you?
Morticia: So she's been adopted... Why didn't you tell me?
Morticia: She... She's okay...
Benoit Leroy: Let me go, Autumn. It doesn't matter to you whether I live or die.
Morticia: Does she have a mother to take care of her?
Benoit Leroy: She does! And her adoptive mother is very good to her. Compared to you or me, she's superior in every way.
Morticia: What does it matter if I find her then... It's meaningless...
Benoit Leroy: That's right, everything is meaningless! Everything I have in the Court of Fontaine, I'll return to you. I don't want it anymore — just let me go.
Morticia: ...
Athos: Autumn, what're you spacing out for? Are you actually considering letting him go?
Athos: Is that it, Benoit? You actually think you can get away?
Traveler: I won't stand by and watch you hurt Benoit.
Athos: So you still want to butt in as far as you can, huh? You have nothing to do with this, but you just have to stick your nose in and interfere, don't you?
Athos: A self-righteous suck-up with a bleeding heart, that's what you are.
Athos: Autumn, are you honestly going to let him go?
Morticia: I... I don't know... I...
Athos: *sigh* You're still too softhearted.
Athos: Benoit, looks like your gamble paid off — a child is a mother's biggest weakness. And considering how you've got help, I'll let this slide for now.
Athos: But we'll see just how far you can run. Let's see what happens first, shall we? Will we catch you, or will you run off to someplace even we cannot find?
Athos: By the way, I hope you don't misunderstand. I won't be the only one chasing you to the ends of the earth.
Athos: I met quite a few friends in the Fortress of Meropide, and before this trip to the Court of Fontaine, many of them expressed a keen interest in meeting you.
Benoit Leroy: My wealth... you can take it all! Take it all!
Athos: It seems today won't be your last day — and before my friends find you, I sincerely hope you'll survive a few more. Now scram.
Black Screen Text: Benoit flees in the opposite direction from the Court of Fontaine, and leaves your sight via the mountain path without ever looking back.
Athos: And as for you... We'll be leaving the Court of Fontaine soon, and I expect we'll never see each other again.
Athos: Autumn, time for us to leave.
Morticia: ...Sorry, Athos, I'm so sorry... my child, she... I'm sorry...
Athos: It's okay. This is a personal matter for you. It's up to you to decide.
Morticia: Let's go.
Paimon: So... That's what happened. What a complicated family!
Paimon: Paimon doesn't know what to say about all of that! Paimon feels bad for Autumn though, she never managed to find her kid in the end.
Paimon: But no matter what, at least we stopped any bloodshed from happening! That's enough, right?

## Talk 6

Athos: Hello, Dad.
Benoit Leroy: ...And it's over.
Athos: When Autumn told me you were planning to escape, I was quite surprised. We've kept you locked up for so long, and yet you still haven't completely collapsed or had a breakdown.
Athos: In fact, you even tried to seize the opportunity to encourage these two "heroes of justice" to assist in your escape. I find your will to live quite moving.
Paimon: ...
Athos: But of all the places you could have run off to, in the end, you chose the place you and Autumn used to visit together? What a foolish blunder.
Benoit Leroy: I...
Athos: No need to explain. I understand. When people are panicked, they naturally and instinctually tread the path they find most familiar, do they not?
Athos: Luckily, Autumn left after you. She hasn't made it here yet, and I do not wish to discuss this in front of her.
Athos: So, just what are you thinking? I truly don't get it.
Athos: Under the guise of marriage, you sold her to others as though she was just a commodity. And you did it twice. The first time, you traded her for a big house in the Court of Fontaine.
Athos: The second time, you randomly chose someone just to get rid of her, so the property and everything else would be yours alone.
Athos: When she was bullied and humiliated, you chose to turn a blind eye. She gave you her child from her second marriage to raise...
Athos: Yet you got rid of her child too. I can only surmise it was so you could take the money meant for the child's support and care.
Athos: How you can give sweets to the children with a clear conscience and ask them to come around to your home as guests is beyond me.
Athos: Doesn't your conscience twinge even in the slightest? Do you feel even the smallest pang of guilt, even for a moment? I find it completely baffling.
Athos: To be honest, I only first met Autumn while she was out on the streets. She is a very gentle mother.
Athos: She cares greatly for my friend's daughter, Penny. If she goes a day without seeing her, little Penny will throw a fit about wanting to see her again.
Athos: Oh, and if you think you still have a chance to turn the tables, think again. Autumn has a whole lot of friends now — not just me.
Athos: It doesn't matter where you scurry off to. We will chase you to the ends of the earth.
Athos: Why must a soul like hers be tormented so, and have nothing, while a scoundrel like you lives a life of luxury? Something doesn't seem right about that to me.
Morticia: No need to wax philosophical. He isn't worth it.
Athos: Ah! It appears you overheard.
Paimon: Oh, so you're Autumn! Paimon finally has an idea of what's going on. The Leroy family really is complicated!
Paimon: #Traveler, we've been following Benoit all the way here, but it turns out a lot of things are completely different from what we imagined.
Paimon: Now that it's turned out like this, should we still involve ourselves? It's up to you.
