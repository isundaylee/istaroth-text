# Fresh Flora


## Talk 1

Flora: How are the flowers that we stored away on Dragonspine earlier?
Traveler: I only managed to retrieve one container...
Flora: The others couldn't be retrieved? Um... Well, alright then. It is quite hard to predict conditions on that mountain, after all.
Flora: But if we only have one, then we can't make any comparisons. I suppose we'll just have to wait for another opportunity...
Flora: Thank you for taking the trouble, though. Here, I prepared these as compensation — I might need to call upon your help in the future as well.

## Talk 2

Flora: How are the flowers that we stored away on Dragonspine earlier?
Traveler: I have them all here.
Flora: All of them? That's great! Here, let me see.
Flora: Hehe, not bad at all. Hmm... Looks like this method really does work.
Flora: The only problem is that Dragonspine is really far from Mondstadt. I can't be troubling you every time, either. I have to find some other way in future...
Flora: Thank you very much, all the same. Here's your compensation, please take it!

## Talk 3

Flora: How are the flowers that we stored away on Dragonspine earlier?
Traveler: I could only retrieve these.
Flora: Well, these experiments have produced good results. It seems as though preservation at low temperatures is a viable solution, hehe.
Flora: The only problem is that Dragonspine is really far from Mondstadt. I can't be troubling you every time, either. I have to find some other way in future...
Flora: Thank you very much, all the same. Here's your compensation, please take it!

### Additional Talk 1

Flora: How are the flowers?
Traveler: I'm sorry...
Flora: Eh? What happened?
Traveler: I broke the containers and flowers by accident...
Flora: B—By accident!?
Flora: Ugh... I specifically picked those flowers out. You can't find such good flowers just anywhere...
Flora: Is Dragonspine so dangerous that even an adventurer like you couldn't keep one container from...
Flora: Still, thanks for making that trip for me. Please take these as thanks. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go tend to my flowers.
Flora: *sigh* Maybe I should try the method that Sara suggested after all...

### Additional Talk 2

Flora: Here, over here!
Flora: Do you still remember the flowers that I asked you to store on Dragonspine?
Flora: It's been a day since then, and I'd like to see the results of our cold storage experiment.
Flora: Could you help me go up the mountain and bring those flowers back?
Traveler: No problem.
Flora: I'm counting on you, then. I'll be waiting here, so do come back soon.
Traveler: Where did I put them, again?
Flora: You forgot? You put them <color=#00E1FFFF>beside a Statue of The Seven</color>, <color=#00E1FFFF>by a body of water in the mountains</color>, and <color=#00E1FFFF>near a cavern</color>.
Flora: Let me help you mark them on your map again.
