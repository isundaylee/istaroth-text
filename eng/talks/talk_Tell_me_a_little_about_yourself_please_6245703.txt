Traveler: Tell me a little about yourself, please...
Ms. Yu: My name's Ms. Yu, and I'm a resource manager with the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Ms. Yu: By resource management, we don't just mean the management of material goods. We also manage information and human resources.
Ms. Yu: I trust that you, too, understand how important resource management is to a city that prizes commerce as much as Liyue does.
Ms. Yu: Exchanging material for manpower and intelligence, and using all three to solve issues â€” that's our Ministry's specialty.
Ms. Yu: More plainly, you help us, we pay you. Haha! So, how about it?
Ms. Yu: Still, the work you can take on is dependent on your reputation. The greater the trust people have in you, the greater the tasks you can take up!
