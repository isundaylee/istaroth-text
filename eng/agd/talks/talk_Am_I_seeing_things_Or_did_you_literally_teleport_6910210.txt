# Talk Dialog

Mualani: Am I seeing things? Or did you literally teleport my entire home here? It's like a treat within a treat!
Mualani: You know what I mean? Like when you buy a drink, and under the bottle cap it says "Have Another Drink" â€” and then you go get your free drink, and that one gives you ANOTHER free drink! A string of good luck.
Mualani: #I wanna share some of this good luck around, starting with you. Here you go: Traveler, wherever you tread, may you find stray Mora at your feet!
