## Talk

Amazolli: Hello there, and welcome to Idukan's Trove.

## Talk

Traveler: I'd like to browse your wares...
Amazolli: Just as you only know what's delicious after you've eaten much, you only know your books after you've read broadly!

## Talk

Traveler: So, tell me about this "Trove"...
Amazolli: "Idukan"... It's a good name.
Amazolli: I read it in a book of legends, but the details of the content escape me nowadays... Still, I recall that its own owner was a figure of much wisdom.
Amazolli: Wisdom comes in many forms. Printed on paper, woven upon cloth, and even spread by word of mouth.
Amazolli: And that's why I named my store after them.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Amazolli: See you. May wisdom keep you from the wrong paths.

## Talk

Traveler: Names are very important.
Amazolli: Indeed!
Amazolli: The great Iktomisaur elder's full name means "He of the Sharp Mist-Shaded Claws," while mine, "Amazolli," means "Ancient Collection of Texts."
Amazolli: So, here I am, running a bookstore.
Amazolli: Just as shamans can gain a glimpse into fate in their dreams, all things have a trail you can follow.
