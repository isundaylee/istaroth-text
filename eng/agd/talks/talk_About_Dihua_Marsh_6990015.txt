Traveler: About Dihua Marsh
Paimon: Did you know? The reeds in Dihua Marsh are common materials used in making paper.
Paimon: The solid reed cores are used to make pens, while the hollow part is used to make flutes, and it's considered an elegant art in Liyue.
Paimon: Over the years, many heroes and swordmen have also chosen Dihua Marsh as the location of their duels.
Paimon: The more reeds, the more elegant the place. But in places where the reeds are the thickest, the water can be quite deep...
Paimon: So there are lots of unlucky duelists who fall in and drown while the duel is on...
Traveler: And what's my takeaway from this supposed to be?
Paimon: Don't fight!
