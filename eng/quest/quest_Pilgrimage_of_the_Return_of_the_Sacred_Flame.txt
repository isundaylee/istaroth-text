# Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame


## Talk 1

Mualani: This mountain is huge. Is the next Tower really all the way up there?
Mualani: It's going to take forever to make it to the top...
Kachina: Just leave it to me! I'll get us up there!

## Talk 2

Mualani: Phew, we made it! Great work, Kachina!
Kachina: Hehe, glad I could help.

## Talk 3

Tournament Bulletin Board: Migue! Migue!!
Liliuo: Hear that? The exhilarating cheers of the crowd... That's why I'm here.

## Talk 4

Xpuhil: Our team captain talked a big game before the match, and well... Was that a quick knockout, or what?
Xpuhil: Should keep a better lookout next time I sign up...

## Talk 5

Paimon: C'mon, Kachina! You can do it!

## Talk 6

Kachina: Guess this is where we're starting.
Mualani: Let me see... Seems pretty quiet around here. Looks like we get to ease ourselves into combat today.
Mualani: Let's head that way. We don't need to worry about avoiding other teams. Anyone that crosses our path can kiss their chances goodbye!
Kachina: Okay. I'll follow your lead.
Mualani: Just remember — don't hesitate. The team matches are all about keeping the energy up, so let's do it!

## Talk 7

Traveler: (Enter the stands)

## Talk 8

Traveler: (There's something I need to do first...)

## Talk 9

Paimon: Have faith in yourself, Kachina — and don't get too tense!

## Talk 10

Paimon: Have faith in yourself, Kachina — and don't get too tense!

## Talk 11

Nkunga: You must be Kachina?
Nkunga: You know, people told me I got lucky in the draw, but I beg to differ. There are no coincidences in the arena. If you're standing here, it means you're strong, no matter what anyone says.
Nkunga: So, I'm looking forward to seeing what you're made of. The team stage ended before I had my fill of battle. I hope you don't disappoint.
Nkunga: Well, anything you want to say in return?
Kachina: I—I won't lose to you, not when so many people are supporting me, and cheering for me, and I—
Kachina: I really want to earn a spot in the Night Warden Wars!
Balam: Alright, our contestants have each said their piece. To your places, everyone. Aaand... Begin!

## Talk 12

Paimon: So full... *yawn* and so sleepy... We should get a good night's sleep before the competition tomorrow!
Paimon: Paimon's still a little worried about Kachina, though. Maybe we can help her out with her training?
Paimon: She did say she wanted to learn from us... Not that Paimon's gonna be doing much of the teaching...

## Talk 13

Paimon: Cheerleaders One and Two are here for you, no matter what!

## Talk 14

Lamanai: We issued a warning to those two troublemakers. Try not to let them get to you.
Lamanai: We get people like that every year. The Pilgrimage symbolizes glory, and some people can't accept missing out on the chance to claim it.

Tournament Bulletin Board: (The final round is about to begin...)
Kachina: Mualani...

## Talk 17

Kachina: Hah!
Liliuo: Ugh!
Liliuo: Gotta hand it to you, kid, you really impressed me. I take back what I said before our match.
Liliuo: You've got what it takes, Kachina. Youngsters like you? You'll forge your own miracles.
Balam: And it's Kachina for the win! We'll now head into a short break as our contestants prepare for the final round of competition!
Kachina: Thanks for cheering me on, you two.
Paimon: You were great out there! You faced a lot of impressive competitors, but they never stood a chance!
Kachina: I don't think I did too shabby, either. I've never gotten this many points before...
Mualani: Ready for the last round, Kachina?
Paimon: Mualani!
Mualani: I got permission to come see you before the last round starts. Based on your score, it looks like you'll make it to the Night Warden Wars if you win your next match.
Mualani: But, uh, your final opponent... It's me.
Paimon: What!?
Traveler: How unfortunate...
Kachina: Yeah, I just found out myself. We're really close in the rankings, so... Only the winner gets to move forward.
Kachina: But, I... I wanted to fight alongside you.
Mualani: I did, too, but it is what it is. People with similar scores tend to get matched against each other.
Mualani: But, we just have to get past it! War is cruel, and the Abyss certainly isn't going to go easy on us. Only Natlan's strongest deserve to stand against them.
Mualani: So, I'm going to give this battle my all, Kachina, and I hope you do the same.
Mualani: To hand victory to your opponent is to take pity on them. But, no one's asking for pity, here, yeah? So, you ready?
Kachina: I—I'll do my best!
Mualani: Attagirl.
Paimon: So, if one of you has to lose... Who should we cheer for, then?
Mualani: Hahaha, you mean one of us is destined to win! It's something worth celebrating either way!
Mualani: I'll be happy no matter who wins, and I know you feel the same way, Kachina. So don't overthink it — let's just have ourselves a good match.
Mualani: #Traveler, Paimon — I'll see you after the match. Kachina — I'll see you on the field.
Traveler: Kachina...
Traveler: Good luck.
Kachina: I've been training so long for this, and Mualani's helped so much. I'm going to show her that it didn't go to waste.
Kachina: Thanks for believing in me. I'll... try believing in myself this time, too.

## Talk 18

Nkunga: *cough* I actually lost... Hah, knew I had an eye for the good ones. Guess that means I was right about you all along...
Balam: Congratulations to Kachina for taking the win! Let's give her a round of applause, everyone! Now, diving into the other match-ups...
Paimon: That's one down, woohoo!
Black Screen Text: The rounds continue. Kachina scores some wins and suffers some losses. Her ranking stays in the middle of the pack.
Black Screen Text: The individual match-ups reach the halfway mark. It's Kachina's turn to take the field again.
Liliuo: Where'd you come from, kid? Think you've got what it takes to go to war?
Liliuo: Hate to break it to you, but it won't be easy to get through me.
Kachina: And you are...?
Liliuo: You don't recognize me? Hah, figures. Our generation's been in decline ever since Atea and the others retired from the frontlines.
Liliuo: Either way, once we face off, you won't forget my name any time soon. Let's do this!

## Talk 19

Kibangu: Hear me out, you two. There's no Fire Tower around here, so there's no need for us to fight it out.
Kibangu: We can see who comes out on top the next time we run into each other. But, for now, I say we focus on preserving our strength. What do you think?

## Talk 20

Balam: And with that, the winners of this Pilgrimage have been decided!
Balam: Put your hands together for our victors as we welcome them to the stage—
Balam: With her sixth consecutive win... Chasca of the Flower-Feather Clan!
Balam: She managed to turn the tides all by herself... Iansan of the Collective of Plenty!
Balam: With an explosive comeback ten years in the making... Kaiulani of the People of the Springs!
Balam: A seasoned and renowned warrior... Kibangu of the Scions of the Canopy.
Balam: Last but not least... Finally living up to her true potential... Kachina of the Children of Echoes!
Paimon: Woo! Over here, Kachina!
Kachina: I... I made it...
Kachina: Feels like a dream.
Chasca: This is no dream. Your strength is what got you here.
Iansan: We'll be going to war together. It's an honor to fight alongside you, Kachina.
Mavuika: No matter how many Pilgrimages I witness, I'm always overwhelmed with pride in this moment.
Mavuika: Pride for you, my brave warriors. You give me faith that our innumerable sacrifices are not in vain, that the future of Natlan shall burn with the brilliance of a blazing fire!
Mavuika: Brave warriors, the following is an order, and also a personal request — go forth and crush the Abyss. Seize victory and glory for Natlan!
Iansan: As you command!
Kachina: A—As you command!
Black Screen Text: As the crowd erupts in cheers, the Pilgrimage draws to a close.
Mualani: #Traveler, Paimon! There you are!
Mualani: I wanted to thank you for supporting Kachina back there. She really has grown into a formidable competitor. She deserved that win.
Mualani: Not that it feels good to lose, but I'm happy for her... *sigh* Definitely bittersweet, though.
Mualani: Hey, wanna go for a walk? Kachina and the others will be busy fighting the Abyss, so why don't I show you around Natlan for a while?
Paimon: #Sure. What do you say, Traveler?
Paimon: Uh, something on your mind?
Traveler: I'm a little worried about Kachina.
Mualani: Listen, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried. But, she's got experienced, powerful companions to take the lead. I'm sure they'll be fine.
Mualani: Glory always comes with a risk. If victory was assured, no one would take pride in it.
Mualani: She's not one to fall so easily. She bears the Ancient Name, "Utha{RUBY#[D]Resilience}biti," after all. We just need to hold the fort while they're gone...
Mualani: Come to think of it, you've never visited my tribe, have you? Come on, I'll take you.
Mualani: The People of the Springs live alongside the Koholasaurs. Our tribe is an ideal spot for some R & R! I'll take you to all the best spots. You'll love it!
Kinich: ...Looks like you beat me to it.
Paimon: Kinich?
Kinich: I was planning on inviting you to visit the Scions of the Canopy. Most of the Adventurers that belong to the Guild come from my tribe, so I figured you might be interested.
Mualani: Hey, first come, first served. You snooze you lose, Kinich.
Kinich: #Yeah, yeah. You were first. Still, Traveler, Paimon, feel free to stop by if you ever have time. You're always welcome.
Traveler: Thank you very much.
Paimon: Yeah! Thanks for inviting us!
Mualani: Alright! Let's pack up and head out!
Traveler: We'll be there.
Traveler: This is her first time fighting in the Night Warden Wars, right?

## Talk 21

Tonina: A competition is no place for regrets. Leave it all on the field. I have faith in you.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Tournament Bulletin Board: (The competition announcement board. The upcoming match schedule and contestant scores are displayed here.)
Kachina: My next opponent is new to the Pilgrimage... But, they still seem really strong.
Kachina: Is... Is it really possible for me to come out on top?

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: Cheerleaders One and Two are here for you, no matter what!

### Additional Talk 3

Paimon: Kachina!
Kachina: Oh, it's you two! I just finished training with Mualani. What's up?
Paimon: Well, you worked so hard to introduce us to Natlan, we wanted to return the favor!
Traveler: Thought I could share some experience with you.
Mualani: Wow, you guys are exactly like Kachina described. No wonder she's already your biggest fan.
Mualani: Guess I should make myself scarce, though. Kachina was the one who helped you out all day, so I don't want to intrude on your secret teachings.
Traveler: It's just a simple piece of advice, actually.
Kachina: Huh? What do you mean?
Traveler: Observation is also key.
Kachina: Observation...
Traveler: Study your opponent. Master their habits.
Paimon: Yeah! The person who hits the hardest isn't always the one who wins!
Kachina: Oh, I... I think I get it...
Kachina: You're saying... fight smarter not harder. Having the strength to win is just as important as knowing the right strategy.
Mualani: Attagirl, Kachina. Exploit your opponent's weaknesses while maximizing your own strengths, and you're sure to find opportunities to turn the tides in your favor!
Kachina: You're right. I just need to focus. When I get nervous, I forget to assess the situation, and end up rushing in without a plan...
Kachina: Mind sticking around a little longer, Mualani? I want to try out some new moves!
Mualani: Sure!
Kachina: Thanks for taking the time to teach me, you two. I won't let you down!
Paimon: Just give it your best shot!
Traveler: Let wisdom become another weapon in your arsenal.
Traveler: A battle is more than just a contest of strength.
Traveler: I want to help you do the best you can.

### Additional Talk 4

Kachina: I'm not keeping you up, am I? You sure you'll be fine tomorrow?
Mualani: Oh, I'm bursting with energy. Couldn't sleep if I wanted to!

### Additional Talk 5

Tonina: I wonder who's gonna win this time. Who do you think's the favorite?
Lamanai: That's a tough one. Anything can happen, especially in the team stage.
Lamanai: Sometimes, the favorites are forced to face each other early on. Factoring in the environment and different participant strategies... It's impossible to predict who will come out on top.
Tonina: True, true. *sigh* You think I'd have a chance in the Pilgrimage one day? I've been training every day after work.
Lamanai: It's certainly possible. I'll be rooting for you if you ever get the chance!

### Additional Talk 6

Liliuo: Hey, Kaiulani. How are the preparations going?
Kaiulani: Not bad, I guess.
Liliuo: You don't look too confident.
Liliuo: Chin up! We're experienced warriors! We've got this in the bag!
Kaiulani: You're as energetic as ever, but I feel like I'm getting old. The last time I fought in the Night Warden Wars was how many years ago, now? Ten? It's already been so long...
Liliuo: Ten years is nothing! We're in our prime! I don't know about you, but I'm going for gold!

### Additional Talk 7

Itzna: Hmm...
Itzna: No surprises, here...
Itzna: No matter how many times I participate, I'm always so nervous...

### Additional Talk 8

Mersa: Five people are going to be selected for the Night Warden Wars this time around, but to be honest... The number makes no difference.
Mersa: Chasca's going to win. I'm sure of it!
Sausa: Seems a little early to celebrate, don't you think?

### Additional Talk 9

Sayil: You two look nervous! Let's go for a drink and kick back for a bit, shall we?
Tlaco: What, now?
Sayil: Now's the perfect time! Knock back a few drinks, and you'll loosen right up. Otherwise, your nerves will keep you up all night. Trust me — I'm an experienced competitor.
Cempoa: And, that's why you're team captain! Great idea!

### Additional Talk 10

Becan: Looks like we'll be commentating together this time around. Pleasure to meet you.
Labna: The pleasure's all mine. Just remember to be liberal with the sunscreen tomorrow — the sunlight is intense up in the hot-air balloon.
