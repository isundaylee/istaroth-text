# Further Observation


## Talk 1

Paimon: Rise and shine! C'mon, it's time to go find Collei.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Collei, we're back.
Collei: Welcome back! You must be tired after all that climbing. Let's take a little break.
Paimon: Ah, by the way, Collei, have you ever seen any small creatures scurrying around in the forest? You know... that kinda look like a veggie?
Collei: A creature that looks like a veggie? Hmm... Well, I guess Master would say something like, "All plants are living organisms, so they also fall under the category of creatures."
Black Screen Text: You tell Collei about the thing you saw earlier.
Collei: Wow, fascinating! It almost sounds like an imaginary creature that you hear kids always talking about! I'll be sure to keep an eye out for anything like it.
Collei: Oh, I almost forgot. Are you two hungry? I packed some food and water for us.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Collei, we're back.
Collei: Welcome back! You must be tired after all that climbing. Let's take a little break now. I brought some food and water for us.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Nice work, that's one clean statue! Let's head down and meet up with Collei.

## Talk 5

Collei: Hmm, no problems with this lamp. Good.

## Talk 6

Paimon: The Dendro Archon's Statue of The Seven is up there. You should try touching it like the other ones we've found on our journey.
Paimon: Paimon bets you'll definitely get a response from the Dendro Archon.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Yay, food! What kind of goodies did you bring!?
Traveler: Paimon, some restraint, please...
Paimon: Hey, don't be a party pooper! It's not like Collei is a stranger or anything. Besides, the best way to compliment a chef is to show passion for their food! Xiangling taught Paimon that.
Collei: I prepared a nice, portable dish that Forest Rangers like to eat, called Pita Pockets. I hope you'll like them...
Collei: Wh—Whoops!
Paimon: AH! Nooo!!! You dropped it on the ground!
Collei: Not to worry! I wrapped a few layers of oiled paper around each pita. They should be fine.
Paimon: Oh, whew... Paimon nearly had a heart attack there.
Black Screen Text: You enjoy the pitas together with Collei.
Paimon: Those pitas are amazing! You're quite the cook, Collei.
Paimon: Thank goodness you wrapped them in paper... Paimon wouldn't be able to sleep at night knowing something so tasty had been wasted.
Collei: Haha, you really know how to compliment the chef, Paimon.
Collei: Since you liked it so much, I'll be sure to give you a copy of the recipe sometime. I'll even include all my personal cooking pointers, so you'll be making your own Pita Pockets in no time.
Paimon: Yay thanks, Collei! It's hard to believe someone as diligent as you could have clumsy moments too.
Collei: Oh, hehe... I guess it happens from time to time.
Paimon: So uh, Collei... Don't you think that Tighnari's a little too strict with you? He won't let you touch anything without his permission.
Paimon: #Paimon knocks stuff over all the time flying around the Traveler, but Traveler's never said anything. Everyone has their clumsy moments!
Collei: No no, you've got the wrong idea about Master. Sure, he may seem a bit harsh at first. With some time, you'll see that he's actually very kindhearted.
Collei: I've heard the veteran rangers say that Master is from some ancient and mysterious race that is known for their cunning wit and reclusive nature. But Master is actually very kind at heart.
Collei: Oh, by the way, you've heard of the Akademiya, right? Well, there's a group called Am... uh, Amu something...
Collei: Well, anyway, because Master does a lot of research on plants, sages from the Akademiya have written him many times, inviting him to take up an official position there.
Collei: But Master declines their offers every time, saying, "Sumeru City is too noisy. It'd be bad for my ears."
Traveler: That does sound like something Tighnari would say...
Collei: Haha, seems you already know him well. Anyway, I'm sure the sages were not happy about his responses.
Collei: Master could obviously have a bright future in the Akademiya, but he insists on sticking to the path of a Forest Watcher. Every day, he helps the locals of the forest and passes on his extensive knowledge to trainees like me.
Collei: In fact, Master's the one who taught me how to make Pita Pockets.
Paimon: Really? Paimon would've never guessed that.
Paimon: Oh, speaking of Tighnari, he was the one who took care of you after finding you passed out yesterday. He even carried you all the way here.
Paimon: Paimon's still kinda upset, though! He kept scolding Paimon the entire way here.
Traveler: What did you do?
Collei: Oh no, I'm sorry. Master might've been overreacting a little...
Collei: #But it's mostly because Paimon wouldn't stop yelling, "Why, oh why!? Is he going to die!?" It probably started to get under Master's skin after a while.
Paimon: Hey! Argh, don't laugh!!! Paimon was genuinely concerned about you!
Collei: Pfft! Hehehe...
Paimon: Hey! Now even Collei's starting to laugh!
Paimon: Ughhh! That's it! Paimon won't forget this! It's time for some Paimonial wrath!
Collei: No! Don't touch me!!!
Traveler: Huh?
Paimon: Oh! Sorry, Collei! Paimon didn't mean to scare you...
Collei: Ah, no I just... I—I didn't mean that...
Paimon: Collei, are you okay? What's the matter?
Collei: No uh, I—I'm fine. I'm sorry, I must've startled you both reacting like that.
Collei: Oh, well it's getting late now. Uh, let's hurry back to Gandharva Ville. I think Master and the others should be back by now, too.
Paimon: Huh, what was up with Collei just now? And why's she in such a hurry all of a sudden...? Look, she's practically running back. Paimon can't even see her now!
Traveler: Collei, what's the matter?
Traveler: Speaking of his ears... I'd really like to pet them!
Collei: Hehehe, I know, right! I've always wanted to pet them, too. Ahem...
Collei: Anyway, Master could have easily left the rainforest to take up a position at the Akademiya. But he chose to stay here instead as a Forest Watcher, helping the locals every day and passing on his knowledge to trainees.

## Talk 8

Nasrin: Ah, Traveler, you've returned.
Paimon: Yep, we're back. Uh, have you seen Collei by any chance?
Nasrin: Oh, Collei? Yes, I saw her go into her room just a moment ago.
Paimon: Oh, okay... Guess we'll just have to wait and talk to her tomorrow then.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Collei: Uh, I'm not a very good climber, so I'll just let you handle the statue.
Collei: I'll go check the facilities up ahead. By the way, once we're done with our work here... would you like to chat some more?
