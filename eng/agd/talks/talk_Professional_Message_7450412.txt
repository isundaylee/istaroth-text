Champion Duelist Evaluation Column: Professional Message
Champion Duelist Evaluation Column: "The design of this thing isn't much different from that of a normal adventurer toy. I cannot see any flair unique to a Champion Duelist in this."
Champion Duelist Evaluation Column: "Furthermore, I do not understand what this 'agility honed through ten thousand underwater dashes' business is about. No Champion Duelist trains underwater in this way."
Champion Duelist Evaluation Column: "This feels like a skin of another toy that lacks sincerity and soul. In sum, this is far from the equal of Lepaute Horlogerie next door."
