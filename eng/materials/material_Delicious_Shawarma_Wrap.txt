# Delicious Shawarma Wrap

A wrap filled with roasted meat. On the thin, soft flatbread lies the tender meat covered in a crispy exterior, and the flavor is enriched by spices and balanced by vegetables. A small mouthful is enough to please one's picky taste buds. Eat carefully, now! You don't want to miss out on a single drop of the juice.
