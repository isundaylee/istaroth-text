# Wines of Mondstadt


## Talk 1

Charles: I wonder if I should tell Master Diluc...
Traveler: What's going on?
Charles: Here's the thing. The Angel's Share was built by the Dawn Winery, and only their very finest alcoholic beverages are served here.
Charles: Mondstadt is home to many taverns, but the Angel's Share is by all accounts the best in the city.
Charles: Everyone has their favorite tipple, of course, and when we first started we could cater to everyone's preferences. But the more customers we get, the more difficult that becomes...
Charles: I want to suggest to Master Diluc to have the winery come up with some new flavors of wine, so that we don't start losing customers.
Charles: But even if he were to agree, developing new products takes time. And I also have no idea what kind of things Mondstadters like to drink these days.
Charles: I heard about the <color=#00E1FFFF>Four Drunkards of Mondstadt</color>, so I am wondering about getting their input first.
Charles: #{NICKNAME}, can you convince one of the <color=#00E1FFFF>Drunkards</color> to come to the tavern?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Charles: You have my thanks. Hope you find one of the <color=#00E1FFFF>Drunkards</color> soon.
Traveler: Ask away.
Charles: #{NICKNAME}, you aren't at drinking age yet — are you?
Charles: In which case, I presume you know precious little about alcohol-related matters. You should ask the experts instead...
Charles: If you don't know where to find the Drunkards, ask Nimrod. His affection for alcohol is widely renowned... Anything to do with drinking, he's sure to know about it.

## Talk 2

Quinn: Honestly, the quality of today's batch...
Quinn: #Oh, hi {NICKNAME}. Can I help you?

## Talk 3

Margaret: Prince has run off again...
Margaret: #Eh? {NICKNAME}, did you want something? If you want a drink, feel free to just go to the tavern.

## Talk 4

Draff: Hunters, hurry!
Draff: #{NICKNAME}? Are you here for some game?

## Talk 5

Jack: When will the next adventure be...
Jack: #{NICKNAME}! Any new stories to tell me?

## Talk 6

Nimrod: That Eury, I mean seriously...
Nimrod: #{NICKNAME}? Can I help you?
Traveler: Who are the Four Drunkards?
Nimrod: You want to know about the Drunkards? You're not old enough to drink though, are you?
Nimrod: I suppose that doesn't stop me from telling you their story though.
Nimrod: There are four people in Mondstadt recognized as absolute champions of alcohol consumption, both in terms of the quantity and quality of what they drink. We call them the Four Drunkards.
Nimrod: Hahaha... Now, try not to be too alarmed when I tell you their names, they might be people you know...
Nimrod: First off we've got <color=#00E1FFFF>Quinn</color>, who runs the fruit stall down near the city gates. He is something of a fruit wine aficionado, which is why he's so picky about the quality of fruit he sells at his stall, too.
Nimrod: Next you've got <color=#00E1FFFF>Margaret</color>, who is often seen strolling the streets. Her idea of what "dandelion wine" is, is on a whole other level compared to what it means to most people.
Nimrod: Then there's <color=#00E1FFFF>Jack </color> from down town Mondstadt. You must run into him all the time? No one loves a beer quite as much as Jack.
Nimrod: Last but not least is the jagerschnapps meister himself... That is, the expert on distilled spirits, <color=#00E1FFFF>Draff</color> of Springvale. No surprises there, huh?
Nimrod: So there you go, that's Mondstadt's Four Drunkards! Any more questions?
Traveler: All clear.
Nimrod: So there you go, that's Mondstadt's Four Drunkards! If you want my advice, I'd suggest you talk to <color=#00E1FFFF>Draff</color> in <color=#00E1FFFF>Springvale</color>. He's always happy to talk about anything alcohol related!
Nimrod: Anyway, you'll find all the other Drunkards in <color=#00E1FFFF>Mondstadt</color> too. It's up to you which one to go looking for.

## Talk 7

Charles: #Ah, {NICKNAME}. You're back.
Traveler: Here are the mixing ingredients.
Charles: What are you planning on making with these!?

## Talk 8

Traveler: Let me give it a little thought...
Charles: If you're unsure, you're better off talking to the Drunkard to refresh your memory.

## Talk 9

Charles: It's hard to please everyone...

## Talk 10

Quinn: #Hang on, let {NICKNAME} mix this one. I'll watch and give some instructions.
Quinn: I've made this drink more times than I can remember and I'm a bit sick of it.
Quinn: I can't fault it — it's just nothing new to me.
Quinn: Traveler, I assume you've never had an alcoholic drink before, let alone mixed one?
Quinn: Who knows — maybe your fresh take on drink mixing could produce something unexpectedly delicious!
Quinn: I was planning on making a Mondstadt Sunset. It has a jagerschnapps base and uses apple juice.
Quinn: First you need to squeeze the fruit juice into the base liquor. Then give it a good shake followed by a thorough stir to really mix the liquor and the fruit juice together.
Quinn: Lastly, let it sit for a while. This gives time for the pulp, and any juices that didn't mix properly, to settle.
Quinn: Through the side of the glass you can see the brilliant brightness of the fruit juices congregating towards the very bottom, just like the setting sun. Hence the name, "Mondstadt Sunset."
Quinn: Time for you to give it a try.

## Talk 11

Margaret: #Eh... I'd rather let {NICKNAME} have a go of mixing this one.
Margaret: There's nothing new about dandelion wine, even if my mixing method is a little unorthodox. The flavor is broadly the same.
Margaret: But after all, it is Mondstadt's signature wine. That much will never change, regardless of any variations in flavor and texture.
Margaret: So let's have the traveler try their hand at making this one. Maybe there is still something new for you to unearth in this mainstay of Mondstadt's wine scene.
Margaret: First I'll talk you through how to mix my special concoction, the Margaret. Hmm... it's essentially an alternative-style dandelion wine.
Margaret: The base of the Margaret is jagerschnapps. The other main ingredient is Dandelion Seeds.
Margaret: First, stir the jagerschnapps until it has an even composition, and add in the dandelion seeds.
Margaret: Next, give it a good shake. This lets air mix with the jagerschnapps and helps it absorb the refreshing flavor of the dandelion seeds.
Margaret: Finally, let it sit a while; the impurities will sink to the bottom while the dandelion seeds rise to the top. Then enjoy the refreshing blast on the tip of your tongue as you down it in one... And there you have it, my signature concoction.
Margaret: Now, give it a try.

## Talk 12

Draff: #Come on {NICKNAME}, let me see you mix a drink.
Draff: Don't look so shell-shocked... I say mix a drink, but really what's there to mix?
Draff: The best way to enjoy the flavor is to drink it straight. The way it comes out the bottle!
Draff: Then again... If you keep that up for too long, it starts to affect your ability to stand up...
Draff: How about this, traveler: Mix me a random drink, preferably one I've never seen before.
Draff: Oh, and I almost forgot — let me tell you how a hunter drinks.
Draff: You have some berries? Good, put them to one side for now.
Draff: Pour yourself a glass of jagerschnapps, then go and do whatever... In any case, let it sit there until you think it's been long enough.
Draff: Then put the ready-to-eat berries in the glass and down it in one!
Draff: You must make sure that the berry juice and the alcohol enter your mouth together.
Draff: Haha, with a glass of that inside me I'm ready to make a charged attack on any prey that comes my way.
Draff: That's all there is to it. Now, get mixing!

## Talk 13

Jack: #This looks like a job for {NICKNAME}.
Jack: Don't be nervous. Beer doesn't need mixing; at most it just needs a minor tweak to how it's made.
Jack: The thing that impacts the flavor of beer the most? That would be the person you're drinking it with, naturally.
Jack: Hahaha. But on a more serious note, the main factor influencing the taste is, of course, the head.
Jack: It forms from the beer splashing when you're pulling a pint, it also forms when you agitate your glass as you're clinking it, and you can smear it on your friend's face to liven things up a little.
Jack: My way of serving beer is very simple. It just takes beer and sweet flower.
Jack: Firstly, put the sweet flower in the bottom of a glass, then pour the beer over it. Shake it up a bit to work up a head.
Jack: Then take a sip, and you should be able to get some of the head and a bit of sweet flower.
Jack: If you clink glasses with a friend, the frothy head splashes out in little pearly beads. That's why we dub it a Pearl Ale.
Jack: What do you think? Pretty easy, huh? Now, give it a go!

## Talk 14

Quinn: Hmm... I need to think what drink to make...

## Talk 15

Margaret: The idea of my signature drink being served at the Angel's Share... Hard to explain how it feels...

## Talk 16

Charles: It looks like you persuaded one of the Drunkards to come here.
Charles: Once they've arrived, let's start mixing some drinks.

## Talk 17

Quinn: Hello? What is it?
Traveler: Remind me how to mix a Mondstadt Sunset.
Quinn: The base of a Mondstadt Sunset is jagerschnapps. You also need apples.
Quinn: First you need to squeeze the fruit juice into the base liquor. Then give it a good shake followed by a thorough stir to really mix the liquor and the fruit juice together.
Quinn: Lastly, let it sit for a while. This gives time for the pulp, and any juices that didn't mix properly, to settle.
Quinn: And there you have it, a Mondstadt Sunset. Any more questions?
Traveler: Goodbye.
Quinn: Have a try, and if you have any more questions, I'll be right here.

## Talk 18

Charles: Okay, so the base is decided.

## Talk 19

Charles: What's the next step?

## Talk 20

Traveler: Add ingredients
Charles: The ingredients are good to go. Let's add them in.

## Talk 21

Traveler: Shake
Charles: Nice! That was a good hard shake, it looks like it's all blended very nicely.

## Talk 22

Traveler: Stir
Charles: Good... Yes, just like that. Your stirring technique is not bad.

## Talk 23

Traveler: Let it sit
Charles: Okay, leave it here then. Sometime playing the waiting game is part of the mixing process.

## Talk 24

Charles: It looks like it's ready.

## Talk 25

Traveler: Nothing.
Margaret: Goodbye. You should stop in at the Cat's Tail some time when you're free.

## Talk 26

Charles: Wow... I've never seen a drink quite like this before. I bet it tastes great...

## Talk 27

Charles: Mmm, very good! I will remember this recipe... I hope my customers will like it. Thanks, traveler.

## Talk 28

Charles: Maybe some of the customers will like it. Thanks, traveler.

## Talk 29

Charles: I... I appreciate all your efforts, but I just can't see most people enjoying a drink like this. I'll have another think. Thanks.

## Talk 30

Traveler: Nothing.
Draff: Goodbye. If you ever want any hunting produce, I'm your guy!

## Talk 31

Traveler: Nothing.
Jack: I thought you had some exciting adventure stories to tell me. Well, bye.

## Talk 32

Charles: Traveler... Please learn to rein in your creative excesses in future.

## Talk 33

Charles: Let's leave it there for today. I look forward to your next concoction.

## Talk 34

Charles: It looks good! I really want to try it...
Charles: Anyway. I will see what other people have to say about this drink first.

## Talk 35

Charles: Hmm... I'm sure someone out there will probably like it...
Charles: Anyway. I will see what other people have to say about this drink first.

## Talk 36

Traveler: I want to start again.
Charles: Start a new drink from scratch? Be my guest.
Charles: There are still some leftover ingredients, but there isn't time to prepare anything new.

## Talk 37

Traveler: Okay.
Charles: I wonder how well this drink will be received...

## Talk 38

Charles: Hmm... Not bad, not bad...

## Talk 39

Traveler: Let's mix some drinks...
Quinn: The Drunkards— Shh! This is a public place!
Quinn: Yes, I do know a thing or two about fruit wine. But you ask me to go and mix drinks with you when I have to watch my fruit stall...
Traveler: About the Drunkards...
Quinn: Shut up! I told you already, not in public! You're a liability you are... Alright, I'll head to the Angel's Share shortly.
Quinn: But since it was you who offered to mix drinks, I'll leave it to you to fetch the ingredients.
Quinn: Let me think... <color=#00E1FFFF>Apples</color> are my go-to when mixing drinks. Meet me at the Angel's Share when you've found some.

## Talk 40

Traveler: Want to mix some drinks?
Margaret: Drunkards, eh. That's... one way of putting it. So, you want to mix some drinks with me?
Margaret: But why me? You know I run the Cat's Tail and the Angel's Share is our biggest rival, right?
Margaret: Calm down, I'm only kidding! One doesn't seriously consider trying to rival the Angel's Share when they have the backing of the Dawn Winery...
Margaret: Anyway, mixing drinks at the Angel's Share sounds quite fun.
Margaret: I'll head over there while you grab some ingredients. Let me see... Dandelion wine is their house special...
Margaret: Yes, go and collect some <color=#00E1FFFF>dandelions</color> for me.
Margaret: We serve dandelion wine too, but it's quite different. Once you've got the dandelions, meet me at the Angel's Share.

## Talk 41

Traveler: Want to mix a drink?
Jack: I... don't really know how. And in any case, have you ever heard of anybody mixing with beer?
Jack: That said, I do know the secret to a better-tasting beer. Firstly, you need a friend you can clink glasses with...
Jack: Beer tastes best after you've clinked glasses with a friend. It's a taste you can't beat, however you want to mix it. That's why adventurers love it.
Jack: Hahaha... Alright, don't give me that look! You have a fair few friends, don't you?
Jack: Tell you what, I'll meet you halfway. If you find me some <color=#00E1FFFF>sweet flowers</color>, I'll meet you at the Angel's Share. Sound good?

## Talk 42

Traveler: Let's make cocktails!
Draff: Cocktails? Pff! I don't drink cocktails!
Draff: I drink my alcohol straight, nothing added, so I can actually taste it! It's the only way to drink.
Draff: But I can come along and give you a few tips. Show you how a real hunter drinks!
Draff: Before you go to the Angel's Share, though, pick up some <color=#00E1FFFF>berries</color> for me on the way.
Draff: What for? You'll have to wait and see.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Charles: #Well, if that's the case, I look forward to your mixological creation, {NICKNAME}!

### Additional Talk 2

Margaret: What's the matter?
Traveler: Remind me how to mix a Margaret.
Margaret: The base of the Margaret is jagerschnapps. The other main ingredient is dandelion seeds.
Margaret: First, stir the jagerschnapps until it has an even composition, and add in the dandelion seeds.
Margaret: Next, give it a good shake. This lets air mix with the jagerschnapps and helps it absorb the refreshing flavor of the dandelion seeds.
Margaret: Finally, let it sit a while so the impurities sink to the bottom and the dandelion seeds rise to the top.
Margaret: And that, my friend, is how Margaret mixes a Margaret!
Traveler: Goodbye.
Margaret: I can't wait to see how yours turns out.

### Additional Talk 3

Draff: Hmm? Did you want something?
Traveler: Remind me how to mix a Charged Attack.
Draff: Simple — it's just jagerschnapps and berries. Have you forgotten already?
Draff: Leave the jagerschnapps to sit until you're ready for it, then add in the berries.
Draff: Got it? Then get to it!
Traveler: Goodbye.
Draff: Get to work on that drink. I'm waiting!

### Additional Talk 4

Jack: Do you need to recap anything?
Traveler: Remind me how to mix a Pearl Ale.
Jack: Oh. You forgot? No worries, let's go over it again.
Jack: All you need is beer and sweet flower.
Jack: Put the sweet flower in the bottom of a glass, then pour the beer over it. Shake it up a bit to work up a head.
Jack: Then comes the good part — glugging away to your heart's content! Easy enough eh?
Traveler: Goodbye.
Jack: Go on, get your drinking cap on!

### Additional Talk 5

Draff: If I was to choose a drink to mix, I'd need to think about it. What was my favorite tipple again...

### Additional Talk 6

Jack: What to mix with beer, hmm... Trial and error, I guess.

### Additional Talk 7

Charles: How is it going? Ready to mix it up?

### Additional Talk 8

Charles: Choose your base.

### Additional Talk 9

Traveler: Jagerschnapps
Charles: A fiery liquor used as a go-to cocktail base throughout the city. The cautious choice.

### Additional Talk 10

Traveler: Beer
Charles: Beer? A fair choice, quick and easy and widely appreciated. ...But can you really mix with beer?

### Additional Talk 11

Traveler: I'm ready.
Charles: All the prep is done, it's time to get mixing.

### Additional Talk 12

Charles: Though you're a beginner, you should have no problem with one of the Drunkards guiding you every step of the way.

### Additional Talk 13

Quinn: Ooh... The sweetness of the freshly squeezed fruit really takes the edge off of the fiery liquor. It goes down smooth, but still has a kick to it.
Quinn: This is some masterful mixology right here! I could serve this Mondstadt Sunset as-is! But where does it get its name?
Quinn: If you look carefully, you can see the fruit juices settling in the liquor. Don't you think it looks like the view from Starsnatch Cliff at sundown as the sunlight pours out over Mondstadt?

### Additional Talk 14

Quinn: Whew, this drink doesn't pull any punches... If anything, the cool of the dandelion seeds seems to add to the fieriness of the liquor! My tongue is numb, but I can't tell whether it's the burn or the chill...

### Additional Talk 15

Quinn: Hey! This is just straight liquor — you call this mixing a drink!?

### Additional Talk 16

Quinn: What a novel sensation. Thick foam, refreshing beer and some crushed sweet flower too... A session beer through and through!

### Additional Talk 17

Quinn: The taste is passable at best, but just look how beautiful it is... The key to making a good Mondstadt Sunset, apart from making sure it's well shaken and stirred, is to let it sit long enough for the juices to settle...

### Additional Talk 18

Quinn: This is... just straight liquor, no? I can't see anything special about it.

### Additional Talk 19

Quinn: Which is why I ask, how can you call this a mixed drink?

### Additional Talk 20

Quinn: Ooh... The texture is like that of regular beer, but where is that residue coming from? Did you put something in it?

### Additional Talk 21

Quinn: Haha... Whatever this is, it sure isn't a Mondstadt Sunrise! You used the wrong ingredients, didn't you?

### Additional Talk 22

Quinn: ...This is just straight liquor!

### Additional Talk 23

Quinn: Oi! At least put something else in the mix. All this is is straight liquor!

### Additional Talk 24

Quinn: Haha, gotta love a good old beer— Hang on, what's this sediment doing in here...

### Additional Talk 25

Quinn: What in Teyvat have you put in this!? My tongue is all numb!

### Additional Talk 26

Quinn: My oh my... That was simply— Oh no! It's all gone...
Quinn: Make me another, won't you? Just one more, just like the last one... Please!

### Additional Talk 27

Quinn: Hmm... Nothing to write home about. But surprisingly good for a beginner!

### Additional Talk 28

Margaret: A very pleasant taste, but you've put too much mixer in and I can barely taste the alcohol. It's more of a fruit juice than an alcoholic beverage. I bet Diona would like it...

### Additional Talk 29

Margaret: It's looking good. Why no other ingredients? That's because it's my house special, the Margaret.
Margaret: Jagerschnapps infused with freshly picked dandelion seeds... Savor that cold rush as it hits your tongue...
Margaret: A glass of this down the tavern late at night perks you up instantly, giving you the presence of mind to deal judiciously with any smooth-talking new acquaintances...

### Additional Talk 30

Margaret: Berries to balance the flavor... A novel approach. But if my customers drank this they'd either collapse in a drunken stupor or walk straight back out of the tavern...

### Additional Talk 31

Margaret: Flavored beer — definitely a thing... But with a head like this you need to drink it up pronto, because if you let the foam disappear then the taste and texture will suffer.

### Additional Talk 32

Margaret: I can taste that it's a fruity cocktail. But I can't tell anything else about it from looking at it.

### Additional Talk 33

Margaret: You can tell it's more than just straight liquor, but the Dandelion Seed flavor isn't coming through at all, probably because of an incorrect mixing technique. My tavern wouldn't stay in business much longer if this was what the Margaret tasted like.

### Additional Talk 34

Margaret: Why are there so many air bubbles in a glass of straight liquor? It creates a fairly disgusting sensation...

### Additional Talk 35

Margaret: The head doesn't feel right somehow, and a bad head kind of ruins a good beer...

### Additional Talk 36

Margaret: Is this supposed to be a fruity cocktail? I am a little underwhelmed.

### Additional Talk 37

Margaret: You forgot what goes in a Margaret, didn't you? Whatever you've made here is completely different...

### Additional Talk 38

Margaret: Yeugh... This is actually disgusting...

### Additional Talk 39

Margaret: It's beer, plain and simple. And boring.

### Additional Talk 40

Margaret: Get that thing away from me! It's destroying my sense of smell...

### Additional Talk 41

Margaret: #Wow, this... Hey {NICKNAME}, how would you like to work at the Cat's Tail?
Margaret: In addition to a generous salary package, you'd have the pleasure of working alongside Diona every day... Give it some thought!

### Additional Talk 42

Margaret: This is the same as what I drink every day. Nothing exceptional, nothing wrong with it either. Alcoholic and drinkable.

### Additional Talk 43

Draff: There's not a whiff of alcohol in this! I'll tell you who this drink's for — big sissy girls, that's who! You certainly won't catch me drinking this in front of the other hunters...

### Additional Talk 44

Draff: Booyah! That'll perk you up alright. One of these before the hunt... Mm-hmm!

### Additional Talk 45

Draff: Now we're talking! A short, sharp shock that leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy all over.
Draff: Gets you ready to make a charged attack on any prey that comes your way. Here's to hunting, and here's to drinking! Hunters, look alive!

### Additional Talk 46

Draff: Beer...? Hmm, it's alright once in a while I s'pose...

### Additional Talk 47

Draff: Fruit-based beverages taste grim... and this one looks grim, too. Get rid of it.

### Additional Talk 48

Draff: There's definitely liquor in there, but what's all that other stuff... Why'd you need to complicate it so much when you can just drink it as-is?

### Additional Talk 49

Draff: Oi, you didn't overdo it on the shaking and stirring, did you? No wonder the texture's all wrong... The body of even straight liquor suffers when you move it about too much. ...But it's still drinkable, I guess.

### Additional Talk 50

Draff: Beer? Can't go too wrong with the odd beer.

### Additional Talk 51

Draff: There is no point in drinking this whatsoever.

### Additional Talk 52

Draff: It'd be alright without all that other gunk in there, but... As it stands, it's a bit of a chore to drink!

### Additional Talk 53

Draff: Don't put such random stuff in there, it ruins the flavor of the alcohol!

### Additional Talk 54

Draff: Phew... I can't taste what makes this different from regular beer... Get me another! I'll give it another try...

### Additional Talk 55

Draff: It's nearly hunting time, I shouldn't have any more.

### Additional Talk 56

Draff: One more please... In fact, get me a few of these to go! I want all the hunters in Springvale to try it!

### Additional Talk 57

Draff: This is nothing special. I could have made this myself!

### Additional Talk 58

Draff: Phwoar, that tastes great! ...But you can barely feel it on the way down. It doesn't have that buzz to it.

### Additional Talk 59

Jack: What did you... I... I can't feel my tongue...

### Additional Talk 60

Jack: Sorry, but I've had a sip and... And one sip is quite enough for me!

### Additional Talk 61

Jack: The best part of a beer is that first sip, right after cheersing with a mate! After that first sip of foam with bits of sweet flower in, the stress of the day just melts away.
Jack: Look at the bits of overflowing foam — don't they look like pearls? Cheers...
Jack: I forgot — you're not old enough. Get yourself an apple vinegar then. This one's on me!

### Additional Talk 62

Jack: Here's a tip. If you want people to actually drink what you put in front of them, it has to look and feel like a genuine drink...

### Additional Talk 63

Jack: Is this... straight liquor? And if so, what's that floating around in it?

### Additional Talk 64

Jack: Straight up liquor...? I think I'll pass, thanks.

### Additional Talk 65

Jack: I can't fault the flavor — but the foam, and as a result the texture... It doesn't exactly scream of friends drinking together and having a good time; more like something you'd drown your sorrows with. What went wrong? ...Then again, since you took the trouble to make it...

### Additional Talk 66

Jack: This is basically the same as every other fruit-juice-centric cocktail I've ever had.

### Additional Talk 67

Jack: Yeugh... This is actually disgusting. Whatever you added just made it worse

### Additional Talk 68

Jack: Yeugh... This is actually disgusting. Whatever you added just made it worse

### Additional Talk 69

Jack: This thick head of foam all but masks a unique and subtle flavor... I can't tell what it is, but it certainly isn't sweet flower.

### Additional Talk 70

Jack: Even the bravest of adventurers wouldn't dare touch this stuff!

### Additional Talk 71

Jack: Wow... this is really something. Shame you're not allowed to drink yet!
Jack: It's a travesty not to be able to share this fine drink with someone else...

### Additional Talk 72

Jack: This tastes decidedly... average. But there's certainly nothing wrong with it.
