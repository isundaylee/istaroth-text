# Sacrificial Offering


## Talk 1

Paimon: A fox statue... Yup, it's the same as the one in Konda Village!
Paimon: But Paimon doesn't see a ward in it... or has the ward been hidden?
Paimon: Ugh, it's some troublesome *secret* again, isn't it...
Traveler: We're a pretty good combination...
Paimon: Hehehe, right? The village chief told us everything.
Paimon: Wait! There's some writing here.
Paimon: *"The ward has been sealed within by sacred words."*
Paimon: Hmm, what does that mean? There's some more writing here as well...
Paimon: "Although I hope the seal will never be broken, and although you have now been missing for many years... If the seal must be broken and the Cleansing Ritual conducted, I hope that you shall be the one to break it."
Paimon: "The third line of the sacred words is something you often used to say in the past."
Traveler: I don't get it.
Paimon: Let Paimon see... "But if the one to undo the seal is my successor, then there is one extra step you must go through."
Paimon: "There are four great spirits, and three spokes in the Mitsudomoe. I have placed *three shikigami* here as guardians. *Only when they are all gathered here in one place* can you proceed."
Paimon: "I wouldn't call this layer of security all that useful, but it should still serve to fend off some petty thieves."
Paimon: ...Eh!?
Traveler: What is it, Paimon?
Paimon: Then we have to find a solution!
Paimon: Otherwise, we'd be no better than "petty thieves"!
Traveler: Is there anything else?
Traveler: I sure hope that isn't the case...

## Talk 2

Paimon: Well, that should do it! Phew, Paimon's exhausted!
Traveler: Shouldn't I be the exhausted one...
Paimon: Let's not fuss over the details, shall we?
Paimon: Hmm, looks like there's a book in here...
Paimon: Whoa, it's so hard to read!
Paimon: Paimon's read it all, but it also feels like Paimon didn't read anything at all.
Paimon: Forget it. Let's get some professional help!
Paimon: Since it's about gods and demons and stuff, let's go to the Grand Narukami Shrine, shall we?

## Talk 3

Inagi Hotomi: The use of sacred words was said to have become a lost art after the Kamuna bloodline failed...
Inagi Hotomi: ...Ah, sorry, I didn't see you there. The Memento Lens is yours to keep. Take it out to see the world, would you?

## Talk 4

Inagi Hotomi: Hello, Traveler from afar. Welcome to the Grand Narukami Shrine!
Inagi Hotomi: If you have some trouble or just want to make a wish, feel free to ask Ms. Gendou for a fortune slip. May the Electro Archon bless you.
Inagi Hotomi: I see. I understand the situation.
Inagi Hotomi: The Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual is a very important rite, and there are indeed records of it...
Traveler: But?
Inagi Hotomi: But the actual details of the ritual have been lost. The Summary you are holding is a very valuable historical artifact in that regard.
Traveler: Lost?
Paimon: Are the Fatui behind this? If you say it's so important, then they might be up to something here too...
Inagi Hotomi: Oh no. The degradation here is due to poor preservation, humidity, and moths.
Paimon: ...
Inagi Hotomi: Ah, it's a great shame, but a lot of historical records have been lost. Lady Yae and Sir Kamisato were fretting over this earlier as well.
Inagi Hotomi: But as for the sacred words, I do know a thing or two.
Paimon: Mm-hmm! Please tell us how to unseal that ward!
Inagi Hotomi: I apologize, but the sacred words used to seal the ward are not some sort of specific formula.
Inagi Hotomi: ... Instead, they are something created by the one who casts the seal themselves.
Paimon: Eh? What do you mean...
Paimon: The spell... was created on the fly by the caster?
Inagi Hotomi: This is not precisely so, either. Sacred words of this sort do have some rules.
Traveler: Do elaborate.
Inagi Hotomi: Hmm... I believe that the records go something like this.
Inagi Hotomi: The first line represents one's own status in Inazuma. Something with the word "envoy" attached to it, I believe...
Inagi Hotomi: The second line is meant to explain the source of one's power. Something like dango, ramen, or a light novel, for example.
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon gets it. Those are definitely great power sources!
Inagi Hotomi: I'm just giving an example. The records use something like "Onmyou Hakkyou."
Inagi Hotomi: As for the third line...
Traveler: ...
Inagi Hotomi: Yes, you've guessed it. It can be whatever you want it to be.
Inagi Hotomi: Considering how long it's been, I doubt that any still live who understand how to use this third line.
Paimon: Ugh, what shall we do, then?
Paimon: Miss Masked Maiden's commission... and this whole nation... it's all gonna go kaput!
Traveler: Relax, Paimon...
Inagi Hotomi: Mm. Perhaps these two items can be of aid to you.
Inagi Hotomi: This is the *Memento Lens*.
Paimon: Memento? So it's a souvenir?
Inagi Hotomi: Since the two of you are so knowledgeable, I trust that you must have heard of the Kamera? It's a Fontaine-made device that can record images.
Inagi Hotomi: A long time ago, when Ritou was first founded, the Hiiragi Clan leader Hiroshi imported many new inventions from other places to prove the benefits of building a trading hub.
Inagi Hotomi: For example, he used a Snezhnayan blast furnace to turn an old Hiiragi Clan mansion at Tenshukaku into a hot spring, before sending it as a gift and token of appreciation to Her Excellency.
Inagi Hotomi: He also used the demon-exorcising mirror gifted to the Hiiragi Clan by the Kitsune Saiguu to create a special Kamera in Fontaine. It can record thoughts and memories. It was returned to us here at the Shrine as a token of appreciation and friendship.
Inagi Hotomi: As the years passed, the Kamera itself ceased to function. Only the lens blessed by the Kitsune Saiguu can still see things that no longer exist in certain special places.
Inagi Hotomi: We extracted the lens and named it the Memento Lens.
Inagi Hotomi: The two of you have come on account of the "sakura," and I can sense from our conversation that you are trustworthy.
Inagi Hotomi: I believe that it will come to good use in your hands.
Traveler: Such an important item...
Inagi Hotomi: I suppose you may not be familiar with this as outsiders, but we believe that everything has a soul. Even stones and trees have memories! And when an item is left unused for a long time, it will grow bitter with dissatisfaction.
Inagi Hotomi: As such, we might as well give the Lens to someone who can show it all the changes the world has gone through rather than letting it gather dust in our shrine.
Paimon: No problem! Leave it to us!
Inagi Hotomi: Legend has it that after the Kitsune Saiguu disappeared, her familiars, the *Earth Kitsune* of Narukami Island, turned into sleeping statues in many places, waiting for her to return.
Inagi Hotomi: If you see a small, strange-looking fox statue, looking at it through the *Memento Lens* may reveal something new.
Traveler: Thank you.
Inagi Hotomi: May the Electro Archon bless you! I shall be counting on you two, then.
Traveler: Leave it to us!
Traveler: She isn't done talking yet...
Traveler: Is it something you can just make up?

## Talk 5

Mysterious Man: Hmm. Yes, it looks like the spirit veins here can still be used.
Mysterious Man: Her familiars are also here. Yes, it is a fine place.
Mysterious Man: Well then, allow me to use sacred words to protect this ward.
Mysterious Man: Then the first line shall be *"In the name of Narukami's envoy."*

## Talk 6

Mysterious Man: ...Guess I'll just follow the previous example and use *"And of the Hakushin bloodline."* as the second line. I am no master onmyouji, after all.
Mysterious Woman: You are... that person who seems very nice on the surface.
Mysterious Man: Hey, long time no see. Guess you're still so cold to me, huh...
Mysterious Man: ...Wait, no. Who are you?
Mysterious Man: This scent... Is it time for the Cleansing Ritual again?
Mysterious Woman: I am... Call me "Hanachirusato."
Mysterious Man: ...No need to tell me. I get it.
Mysterious Man: I thought she had returned for a moment there... Huh, so that's what happened.
Mysterious Man: Yeah, don't worry about it. Nice to meet you, Miss Hanachirusato!
Mysterious Woman: I... I remember now. About the Sacred Sakura. About you. About Raiden.
Mysterious Man: Mm-hmm. Ah, wait. Perhaps what you're seeing right now is not me, but Ioroi in disguise.
Mysterious Man: After all, Miss Hanachirusato, you've never seen me in person before, right?
Mysterious Woman: I'm not sure there would be much difference either way, if my memory serves.
Mysterious Man: Eh? Come on, that was uncalled for...

## Talk 7

Mysterious Man: My, that lady is such a buzzkill.
Mysterious Man: If I am to have a disciple one day, I shall find a cheerful and beautiful lady. Yeah, I'll make sure of that.
Mysterious Man: Now, as for the third line... Ah, right, this looks good.
Mysterious Man: *"Bring forth the fried tofu"*!
Mysterious Man: Since this is her territory — the land of the Hakushin bloodline — we'll go with that.

## Talk 8

Mysterious Woman: How quickly the shrine has fallen to neglect after losing its master and the incense within...
Mysterious Woman: I can only hope that the barrier within the cavern still stands strong.
Mysterious Woman: Ah, I remember now. She once instructed people to *construct a locked gate* by a canal on the road leading to Chinju Forest, before giving the key to the Konda Clan.
Mysterious Woman: I hope everything is still alright.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Well, that should do it! Phew, Paimon's exhausted!
Traveler: Shouldn't I be the exhausted one...
Paimon: Let's not fuss over the details, shall we?
Paimon: Hmm, looks like there's a book in here...
Paimon: Whoa, it's so hard to read!
Paimon: Paimon's read it all, but it also feels like Paimon didn't read anything at all.
Paimon: Forget it. Let's get some professional help!
Paimon: Since it's about gods and demons and stuff, let's go to the Grand Narukami Shrine, shall we?

## Talk 10

Records: "The ward has been sealed in place using *sacred words*. There are four great spirits, and three spokes in the Mitsudomoe. I have placed *three shikigami* here as guardians. *Only when they are all gathered here in one place* can one proceed."

## Talk 11

Mysterious Man: ... Yeah, it's decided. We'll let her go this time.
Mysterious Man: After all, it's not my job, and it's not as if she is some monster, charging at me like an Ochimusha might.
Mysterious Man: I'm all tuckered out already. I thought I had run into a long-lost friend. That feeling is so exhausting...

## Talk 12

Mysterious Woman: Then let us part ways here.
Mysterious Man: Ah, you're so cold.
Mysterious Woman: "Rosy-cheeked in the morning, bleached bones by dusk."
Mysterious Man: Oh, come on! It was at least half an emotional reunion for me! Actually, maybe it was more like one quarter?
Mysterious Man: Ah, you're gone already? Come on...

## Talk 13

Mysterious Man: That being said, after she left, Ioroi seems to have led his tribe to wreak havoc everywhere.
Mysterious Man: Well, I could have kept one eye shut, had Ioroi stayed in the Chinju Forest.
Mysterious Man: Mm. Guess he needs to be taught a good lesson...

## Talk 14

Mysterious Woman: This was... my previous...
Mysterious Woman: Wait, that wasn't me. It was her previous territory.
Mysterious Woman: That person over there... seems so familiar...

## Talk 15

Mysterious Man: Yeah, guess we're done here. Time to write all this down and hand it over to the shrine.
Mysterious Man: After all, this isn't like the shikigami paper I use. With any luck, they'll preserve it properly. Things might get dicey if these document come across moths or water.
Mysterious Man: Ah! Silly me, saying such inauspicious things...
