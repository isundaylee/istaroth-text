Traveler: Can I offer you a nice Teyvat Fried Egg...
Matsumoto: Aha, you must have seen my commission. You know, I've been to both Uyuu Restaurant and Kiminami Restaurant, and I was underwhelmed.
Matsumoto: I think that the really talented chefs must be hiding out of sight. That's why I posted a commission.
Matsumoto: If you're here, it must surely mean that you've got 5 Teyvat Fried Eggs for me?
Traveler: They're ready
Traveler: No, not yet.
Matsumoto: Oh. Then please bring them to me when they're ready.

Traveler: Who are you?
Matsumoto: I'm Matsumoto, the traveling food critic. Recently, I've found myself in a dilemma of having no dishes to try out.
Matsumoto: I have already finished going through every single restaurant on this street. Whether it's Uyuu Restaurant or Kiminami Restaurant, there is nothing new around here.
Matsumoto: With my years of experience as a food critic, I'd rate these joints as "mediocre."
Matsumoto: I have tasted every single bizarre gourmet dish there is, but I find that there is more authenticity in simple and plain things.
Matsumoto: If you asked me what the tastiest thing in this world is... I would say it must be the lemon drink with unlimited refill from Kiminami Restaurant.

Traveler: Bring it to you...?
Matsumoto: Yes, that's right. What's the matter?
Matsumoto: You're asking me to taste the food, so obviously you should be the one who pays or makes it for me.
Matsumoto: It would be difficult to be objective if you asked me to pay for the food. The price of the dish would affect the result.
Matsumoto: Only through a trade with no exchange of money can there be a fair review.

Traveler: What kind of dishes are you looking for?
Matsumoto: Simpler dishes do a better job at revealing the chef's true mastery over the culinary arts.
Matsumoto: For example, these Egg Rolls from the Kiminami Restaurant. The dish needs to be at least of this level for it to be worthy of my critique.
Matsumoto: If you can't make something of this level, then I suggest you give up, as you are only wasting my time.
