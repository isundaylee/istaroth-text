# Garcia's Paean: A Gift of Compatibility


## Talk 1

Ahangar: Man, I don't understand it. Why do you have to use that weird machine to write some music score?
Ahangar: You see, in Sumeru City there are plenty of spices and jewelry on sale.
Ahangar: If none of them look good to you, I can help you make some accessories, too...
Garcia: Well, about that... It was because of the Numbering Machine that I met Kaia.
Garcia: So I want to send her a gift that is related to the Numbering Machine, which is this "Arithmetic Music Score."
Ahangar: Heh, I don't get you. The Ms. Kaia you're talking about is a performer from a professional troupe. She has tons of good music scores to read.
Ahangar: What if she tosses your score away or completely forgets about it?
Garcia: Kaia would never do it, I am most certain.

## Talk 2

Lutong: With all due respect, sir, it is beyond me to even think of a way to just hum the melody with this "music score" you created.
Lutong: If I may, sir, if you truly intend to create a... um... decent music score...
Lutong: We might as well pay a modest fee for hiring a professional in the theater to help...
Garcia: No. Negative. Not possible. That way the gift would mean nothing. I'll further modify the arithmetic formula and generate another music score!
Garcia: Besides, it will definitely take even longer... Let me think about it...
Traveler: What are you two doing?
Lutong: Traveler, perfect timing! Mr. Garcia and I are trying to train the Numbering Machine into a fine composer.
Lutong: It might sound a bit perplexing. To put it simply, Mr. Garcia is trying to make the Numbering Machine generate music scores through certain equations.
Traveler: Can the Numbering Machine really do that?
Lutong: The Numbering Machine is a calculator by its nature. It is, of course, not capable of generating music scores on its own.
Lutong: After the Numbering Machine produces its results, Mr. Garcia has to use another arithmetic formula to translate everything into music notes.
Traveler: I'm having a headache!
Garcia: Precisely, Lutong! That is a very nice summary. It is exactly what I meant.
Garcia: So much for the explanation, Traveler! I am in a pressing need of your help. Please lend me a hand.
Garcia: Mora and other payments will not be a problem. This is urgent!
Traveler: Are you in trouble?
Garcia: Negative, negative. It is an even direr situation!
Garcia: Do you happen to remember Kaia... I mean, Ms. Kaia? She is leaving Sumeru with her troupe today.
Garcia: I made a promise to her that I would present her a gift as a proper good-bye.
Garcia: And this "Arithmetic Music Score," which is calculated purely by algorithm, is my gift for Kaia.
Garcia: But... The score doesn't even look like it could be sung... There's no way I can present this as a gift to her!
Traveler: How about other gifts?
Garcia: I'm afraid that won't work. If it were a commonplace gift, Kaia might... Apologies, I need a moment to calm down and collect my thoughts.
Garcia: A—Anyway, I need to further upgrade the Numbering Machine.
Garcia: Traveler, please come visit Mr. Ahangar with me. I am certain that you will be of great help. Please lend me a hand.
Traveler: How about buying something instead?
Traveler: Are you wanted by Fontaine?
Traveler: I think I'm totally getting this.
Traveler: Is the Numbering Machine that powerful?

## Talk 3

Ahangar: I saw your sketches of the components.
Ahangar: They are not hard to make, but it'll surely take some time to reach your desired level of precision.
Garcia: How much time will it take? Can it be finished today?
Ahangar: Of course not! What do you think manufacturing components is like? Writing letters?
Garcia: If it can't be done today, I definitely won't be able to upgrade the Numbering Machine...
Ahangar: What's with the hurry? Isn't your machine already finished?
Lutong: I'll explain. We ran into... uh... some expected trouble...
Black Screen Text: Lutong tells everyone what happened...
Ahangar: So you fell in love with Ms. Kaia at first sight...
Garcia: What!? No! We are in a cooperation! Business partners! Goodness gracious, I am utterly...
Ahangar: Have you expressed your affection for Ms. Kaia?
Garcia: Affection? What...
Ahangar: So you never told her that you have a...
Lutong: I can assure that Mr. Garcia has mentioned it to her before.
Garcia: What!? Lutong! How did you know!?
Lutong: My good sir, the excuse you used when you sent me away that time was simply too telling.
Lutong: That day in the café, too. Throughout your conversation with Ms. Kaia, you didn't even mention your Numbering Machine once.
Lutong: Knowing you, I am certain that it was not any regular conversation.
Garcia: Much appreciated, Lutong! Please, use that good memory of yours on something else.
Traveler: What did Ms. Kaia say?
Garcia: Sh—She said she would pay for the coffee the next day.
Lutong: Aha.
Traveler: Ohh...
Garcia: Can we please move on? The most pressing issue at the moment is components!
Ahangar: Ahem, since you've already paid, I'll do my best to finish these components as soon as possible.
Ahangar: But seriously, if you want a gift that makes Ms. Kaia happy, why don't you go and ask for some advice from a professional?
Ahangar: Like Sheikh Zubayr who runs the theater. He knows the likes and dislikes of his performance staff. He might know what gift you should give Kaia, too.
Lutong: That is a splendid idea. Mr. Garcia, please continue your discussion on the components with Mr. Ahangar.
Lutong: As for the Traveler and me, we shall pay a visit to the theater and ask Mr. Sheikh Zubayr for potential gift choices.
Lutong: As you often tell me, a backup plan is necessary for all pursuits, isn't it?
Garcia: Ah, thank you, Lutong.
Lutong: You're welcome, Mr. Garcia.
Lutong: Let's hit the road, Traveler. I hope we will find... the right gift.
Traveler: What did she think?

## Talk 4

Sheikh Zubayr: Whew... Finally a break...
Sheikh Zubayr: Hmm? You came for me? What do you need?
Lutong: We would like to learn about Ms. Kaia...
Black Screen Text: Lutong asks the questions...
Sheikh Zubayr: Kaia? Oh, right. She is a brilliant dancer.
Sheikh Zubayr: What she likes, huh? Hmm... If there has to be one... She is very fond of a snack called Candied Ajilenakh Nuts.
Sheikh Zubayr: But isn't Kaia about to leave Sumeru? She's been asking around to buy Candied Ajilenakh Nuts lately.
Lutong: Candied Ajilenakh Nuts... Right, we transcribed a batch of recipes a few days ago when we were testing the capacity of the Numbering Machine. The recipe for Candied Ajilenakh Nuts was one of them.
Lutong: Hmm... This sounds like a good idea. It's just that we still need someone who knows how to make them. Mr. Garcia and I are the least familiar with culinary arts...
Traveler: I've seen it before...
Lutong: But it could at least be a feasible backup plan. Let's return to Mr. Garcia and tell him about this.
Lutong: Judging from that look on your face... I assume you have some questions?
Traveler: Why don't you go with Kaia?
Lutong: I have proposed this idea to Mr. Garcia. I even negotiated with the troupe leader, and he was willing to hire me as their accountant.
Lutong: However, Mr. Garcia turned me down firmly, saying he had plenty of work yet to be finished and that the Numbering Machine still needed to be upgraded in various aspects.
Lutong: Hehe, to be honest, that was my first time to question Mr. Garcia's judgment on important matters.
Lutong: Enough about this. Let's bring the news to Mr. Garcia. I hope he won't wear out Mr. Ahangar's patience this time...
Traveler: Has Ms. Kaia told you anything?
Lutong: Not that I'm aware of. Ever since a few days ago, whenever Mr. Garcia went on a date with Ms. Kaia, I would drink my coffee in the corner away from them and try my best to keep my eyes away.
Lutong: Actually, all this time I've been hoping that one day, Mr. Garcia would suddenly say to me that he would postpone the development of the Numbering Machine and travel around with Ms. Kaia for some time.
Lutong: I would happily agree whether he gives me some compensation and temporarily sends me back to Liyue, or lets me continue keeping their accounts as usual.
Lutong: But each time, Mr. Garcia only pats on my shoulder and says: "Lutong, we need to continue discussing the mechanical structure."

## Talk 5

Garcia: Lutong! You're finally back. Mr. Ahangar and I have been trying to find a way to reduce the time needed for component manufacturing, but there has been no progress so far. I'm running out of ideas...
Lutong: I assume this is good timing. The Traveler and I have just come up with a backup plan.
Lutong: The formula for transcribing music scores might be too complicated, but do you remember the recipe for Candied Ajilenakh Nuts that we transcribed?
Lutong: We learned that Ms. Kaia is quite fond of a kind of snack called Candied Ajilenakh Nuts. Perhaps we could...
Garcia: ...Send the transcribed recipe along with the snack! Yes, of course, this could work...
Ahangar: I have neither the appropriate cooking equipment nor the culinary skills. Guess I can't be of much help.
Lutong: I remember there's a pot we can use at Lambad's Tavern. Why don't we go there?
Garcia: Really? Great! Let's go! But how did you even manage to remember this...
Lutong: It is my duty, sir.
Black Screen Text: The group goes to Lambad's Tavern.
Garcia: Splendid! We have both the ingredients and the pot ready. Hmm... Give me some time to recall the formula. Let's see... Where is my pen... Let me calculate this...
Garcia: This should do it! I've got the key data covered. Give me a few minutes to go over some other details...
Traveler: H—How did you manage to remember all of this?
Garcia: I don't memorize everything. I just ran a brief mental calculation... It is not very complicated, given that I had it all calculated before.
Garcia: However, ingredient input varies between each group of data, but time for detailed calculation is a luxury at the moment...
Garcia: Traveler! You travel around the world. I'm certain that you have tasted quite some delicacies. I trust your intuition. I'll let you decide on the ingredient that's added in the maximum amount.
Lutong: The ingredients are: Ajilenakh Nuts, almonds, butter, and Sumeru Roses.
Traveler: Ajilenakh Nuts should be the biggest portion of the ingredients.
Garcia: Hmm... Indeed. By the name of Candied Ajilenakh Nuts, the input of Ajilenakh Nuts should be maximized.
Garcia: Lutong, add the ingredients according to the data. We must hurry.
Lutong: Yes, sir.
Black Screen Text: The three of you start making Candied Ajilenakh Nuts...
Garcia: Is the number of Ajilenakh Nuts mildly... overwhelming? With this rate, I believe we can conveniently remove "candied" from the name "Candied Ajilenakh Nuts"...
Lutong: Well... At least it bares the portion of a proper meal...
Garcia: Anyway... Let's take these snacks and the recipe to Ms. Kaia now. I've made an appointment with her to meet at the usual place.
Garcia: Oh, right, put this music score away, Lutong. I fear that I might hand it to Ms. Kaia accidentally...
Garcia: Wait, where is the score? Do you not have it, Lutong!?
Lutong: You had it with you the entire time, sir. If you don't have it, where else...
Garcia: Oh dear...
Lutong: Uh... sir?
Garcia: Go back to the café, now! I must have put the score on the table!
Traveler: Almonds should be the biggest portion of the ingredients.
Garcia: I am quite fond of the taste of almonds. Hmm... We shall proceed this way.
Garcia: Lutong, add the ingredients according to the data. We must hurry.
Lutong: Yes, sir.
Black Screen Text: The three of you start making Candied Ajilenakh Nuts...
Lutong: Sir, I'd prefer to call them "Honeyed Almonds."
Garcia: Well... We at least kept the sweet flavor of honey... They should have a... decent taste, I assume?
Traveler: Sumeru Roses should be the biggest portion of the ingredients.
Lutong: Why are we using flowers in making honeyed sweets? This is perplexing...
Garcia: That might explain why they're sold at such a high price.
Garcia: Lutong, add the ingredients according to the data. We must hurry.
Lutong: Yes, sir. Uh... Might I remind you that these ingredients are very expensive...
Garcia: Don't... don't worry. Keep it going.
Black Screen Text: The three of you start making Candied Ajilenakh Nuts...
Lutong: My goodness, would you look at that? If I didn't know these were edible sweets, I would think that they were an impressive bouquet for your proposal...
Garcia: Lutong! For once again, would you kindly channel that splendid power of imagination of yours elsewhere!?
Lutong: I believe this is perfectly opportune, sir.
Traveler: Do you know all this by heart?

## Talk 6

Kaia: What's the hurry? Did something happen to the machine again?
Garcia: No, no. It is doing just fine. My apologies for keeping you waiting...
Kaia: I just arrived. You said you were going to send me a gift. I have a gift for you, too.
Kaia: Here, this bag of Candied Ajilenakh Nuts is for you. Having some sweets at work is a good way to relax both the body and mind.
Kaia: Building that Numbering Machine is no easy task. You must take good care of yourself while working.
Garcia: Candied Ajilenakh Nuts? I... uh...
Kaia: What's with the weird look? You don't like sweets? But I remember you told me that you like them.
Garcia: No, no. I love sweets. It's just... my gift for you is also...
Black Screen Text: Garcia takes out his Candied Ajilenakh Nuts and the recipe awkwardly...
Kaia: Pfff... We have the same gift for each other, huh? Looks like we are more connected than we think.
Kaia: Your Candied Ajilenakh Nuts sure have a different aroma. Oh, there's a recipe, too... Huh? Why is it written in numbers...
Garcia: This is the Candied Ajilenakh Nut recipe I transcribed from the Numbering Machine's data! I converted all procedures and the amount of ingredients into accurate numbers.
Garcia: I—It's just like how I explained before. The accuracy is guaranteed! But I'm not really good at cooking, so these Candied Ajilenakh Nuts might taste very odd...
Kaia: Don't worry. I'm sure I'll have a good time savoring these "calculated" Candied Ajilenakh Nuts. This is such an impressive gift.
Kaia: Right, when I got here, there were many sheets of paper on this table, all covered in numbers like this recipe.
Kaia: One of them had many codes on it. It looked like... a music score.
Kaia: Come to think of it, the handwriting on that paper looked just like yours.
Garcia: That has nothing to do with me! I—It's probably some graffiti by some random drunkard...
Kaia: Come on now, I have organized your scripts and transcribed texts for you. It was your handwriting, without a doubt.
Kaia: I see. You have found another way to make a living before I leave, huh?
Garcia: A—Absolutely not. I—I would never write music scores for others in any circumstances!
Kaia: Is this score for me then?
Garcia: I... I...
Traveler: Has he... been in a romantic relationship before?
Lutong: Please understand, Traveler. Mr. Garcia spends the substantial majority of his time in his studies, leaving himself little chance to socialize.
Lutong: Maintaining such a heavy workload and having adept social skills at the same time would be impractical.
Traveler: Why don't you help him?
Lutong: Well, I am always hoping that Mr. Garcia can find his true love.
Lutong: I believe that this heartfelt good wish qualifies for my salary undoubtedly.
Kaia: ...Come on now, enough with the sad expression. This time I won't be able to watch you calculating stuff... I'm leaving Sumeru.
Garcia: This is a... um... failed product. I wanted to create a music score for you, so I collected the music scores of most of your performances.
Garcia: I organized these scores and worked out a formula, hoping to create an all new score with my Numbering Machine.
Garcia: As you can see, regardless of how I changed the formula, it always resulted in a pile of... a pile of mess that was by no means music scores.
Garcia: Please return this failed piece to me, I need to—
Kaia: This is not a "failed piece." This is your gift to me. I love it, and I'll keep it.
Garcia: But you can't even call this a music score! It's not even readable!
Kaia: That's only your perspective. I haven't given it a careful look yet, so maybe after I have... I'll be able to find something good about it.
Kaia: If you don't believe me, then come with me. During our trip, we can modify this score together.
Garcia: Kaia, I am sorry, I...
Kaia: ...Still have a lot of ongoing studies, right? I knew you'd say that.
Kaia: Do you have a copy of this music score for yourself?
Lutong: I have made a copy of the score. Please keep the original handwritten score, Ms. Kaia.
Garcia: Pardon me. When did you make the copy?
Lutong: Sir, as an account keeper, I maintain a professional capability of transcribing texts.
Garcia: Wait, how did you... no way...
Lutong: Sir, to be honest, I cannot recall it with sufficient clarity. We were occupied in work, I didn't allocate my attention otherwise.
Kaia: Lutong, how thoughtful of you! With you by his side, I have nothing to worry about.
Lutong: You flatter me, Ms. Kaia.
Kaia: Well, I should go back to the troupe now.
Kaia: Don't come see me off. Should you have any last minute thoughts and joined us, Lutong would be left alone in Sumeru.
Lutong: If that happened, I would find a way to return to Liyue, Ms. Kaia.
Kaia: I have no doubt in you, but... a certain someone might not give you that chance.
Garcia: Kaia...
Kaia: Goodbye, Garcia.
Garcia: ...Goodbye.
Black Screen Text: Kaia turns and leaves...
Lutong: Sir, Ms. Kaia is well away from here by now.
Garcia: Lutong, you said your instinct is always correct.
Garcia: Do you think we'll meet Ms. Kaia again in the future?
Lutong: Of course, but considering her talent in the performing arts, I believe we might need to pay to see her performance next time.
Garcia: Hahaha, that is a valid point indeed... Let's re-focus ourselves on the studies now, shall we? Or we'll probably be caught short financially for tickets by then...
Lutong: Here is your payment, Traveler. Thank you very much for not leaving our side throughout all this. Please take the Mora.
Traveler: I hope your studies go well.
Lutong: Much appreciated. I hope so too.
Garcia: Lutong, uh... do you happen to have some Mora on you? I need to pay Mr. Ahangar...
Lutong: Please excuse us for now, Traveler. By the way, my intuition tells me that we will have abundant opportunities to work together in the future.
Traveler: Can't you give him some advice?
Traveler: Kaia is doing all the work here...
