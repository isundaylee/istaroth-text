## Talk

Cyno: Ah, you're back.
Cyno: Be sure to get ample rest before your next adventure.

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Cyno: At first, I couldn't get used to how quiet it is here.
Cyno: There's no howling desert wind or sound of bugs skittering in the rainforest.
Cyno: When you're trying to get to sleep, it's so quiet and peaceful that you almost start wondering whether it's even real... which makes it hard to relax.
Traveler: Are you more used to it now?
Cyno: Yes. I just tell myself that I'm on a vacation and that I shouldn't worry about what's going on anywhere else.
Cyno: Though, of course, before bed every night I still reflect on my previous battles and review what I've learned.
Traveler: Have you managed to get any rest?
Cyno: Don't worry, I feel much more relaxed now than I was at the Akademiya.
Cyno: The point of rest is to relieve the stress and fatigue you've built up, it doesn't mean completely changing who you are.
Cyno: I really like it here. It's a place where I can finally enjoy a moment of peace. I'll use this time to revitalize myself and prepare for the next time I need to administer judgment.

## Talk

Traveler: Want to have a chat?
Cyno: Sure, I'll even tell you a couple of jokes.
Cyno: Why did the Sumpter Beast cross the road while burdened with heavy goods? To get to Sumeru's "Most Sumptuous Sumpter Beast" bodybuilding competition.
Cyno: Well, what do you think?
Traveler: Huh?
Cyno: Here's another one. Which creature has the worst personal hygiene in all of Teyvat? Cryo Slimes. Why? Because they always bounce on top of the water, and never go in for a bath.
Traveler: ???
Cyno: You don't find that funny at all?
Traveler: Uhh... it's very forced...
Cyno: Okay. Well, never mind...
Cyno: It's really hard for me to tell what jokes someone might find funny.
Traveler: Why are you so eager to tell jokes?
Cyno: It's because I always have this ultra-serious look on my face, and it stresses out the other matra.
Cyno: One time, it hit me that I should try telling a couple of jokes. So I gave it my best shot, and the room fell completely silent, with everyone just staring at me. But then, after a few moments, someone started laughing and said "you call that a joke!?"
Cyno: Then everyone else started laughing. Even though they were all saying that my jokes weren't funny, I could tell that I had lightened the mood.
Cyno: So I thought, even if the jokes aren't funny, at least telling them can still help the others around me feel more at ease.
Cyno: Besides... if I tell lots of jokes, not ALL of them can be bad, surely.
Cyno: I just need to stick to it, and I know that one of them will land... someday.
Traveler: Maybe a little...
Traveler: Is that all?

## Talk

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Cyno: Now that I think about it, it's been all of five days since I last played a game of Genius Invokation TCG.
Traveler: Does that feel like a long time to you?
Cyno: No, not really. The longest I've ever gone without playing was 20 days.
Cyno: I was on a dangerous mission and didn't have any time to sit down and play.
Cyno: By the time I got back, I realized that my deck was already out of the meta, and I kept losing game after game. Eventually, I made some adjustments and finally started turning things around.
Cyno: You have to keep playing if you want to maintain a good win rate. Otherwise, you'll be caught off guard by new and upcoming strategies.
Traveler: You really like Genius Invokation TCG, don't you?
Cyno: Yes. Is that strange? You have a funny look on your face.
Cyno: The first time I played, I just saw it as a game to pass the time.
Cyno: As a matra, your heart is like a bowstring... It cannot become too slack, but it cannot be too taut, either. Otherwise, it could snap without warning at any time.
Cyno: So once I started playing Genius Invokation TCG, I wanted to use it as a way to take my mind off other things. You know, as a way to help me relax.
Cyno: ...But now, it is much more than just a game to me.
Traveler: What changed?
Cyno: In my previous work, I punished many criminals who had broken the rules and had to listen to their constant complaining.
Cyno: In most cases, I couldn't understand them, and they couldn't seem to understand me, either.
Cyno: And it's not just criminals. Even with your friends, there are bound to be some topics where you are unable to understand one another.
Cyno: But Genius Invokation is different. I can always clearly discern what my opponent is thinking.
Cyno: Their hunger for victory, their confidence in the deck, their passion for the game... Many can hide their strategy, but few can conceal these emotions.
Traveler: I can relate to those feelings, too.
Cyno: Really? Are you up for a game then?
Traveler: Are you kidding? I thought you'd never ask!
Cyno: I never go easy on anyone. Just play your best.
Cyno: I'll help walk you through the game once we're finished.
Traveler: Please go easy on me...
Traveler: I think I understand what you mean.

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Cyno.
Cyno: Good morning, you look like you're ready and raring to go.
Cyno: Any plans today? If there's anything you need help with, just let me know.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Cyno.
Cyno: Sleep well. Everything else can wait until tomorrow.
Cyno: Just calm your mind and breathe steadily, you'll fall right asleep. I'll be sure to wake you up in the morning. Goodnight.

Cyno: Resting here brings back a lot of memories.
Cyno: I travel a lot for work. Sometimes, I have to camp or lodge in a village.
Cyno: It was an unfamiliar experience at first, but I got used to it. ...Looking back now, I can hardly believe how long I've been with the matra.

## Talk

Cyno: Good. Each book is neatly in its place.
Cyno: The spines are facing out, books with a similar theme are grouped together, and there's not a single banned volume to be seen.
Cyno: Wait, are some of them crooked? I must correct this at once...
