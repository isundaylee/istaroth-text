# Key-Shaped Ward

An ancient and mysterious item shaped like an ancient key. Where there's a key, there's a lock â€” but this key's lock is about to be breached by the defilement absorbed by the tree's roots.
According to Hanachirusato, these wards are needed to conduct the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual.
