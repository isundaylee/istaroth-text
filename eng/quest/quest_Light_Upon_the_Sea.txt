# Light Upon the Sea


## Talk 1

Xiao: So, is the matter resolved?
Traveler: We took care of it, but—
Xiao: —Good.
Traveler: Are you really not going to see the Mingxiao Lantern?
Xiao: No. As I said, I am not partial to crowded areas. Especially at this time of the year.
Traveler: The Mingxiao Lantern this year is Skybracer.
Paimon: Yeah, it's a super impressive-looking giant deer, let's go take a look together!
Xiao: "Skybracer..."
Xiao: Huh, a Mingxiao Lantern nonetheless. A fleeting creation of human hand. It means nothing to me.
Xiao: If this short-lived spectacle is one you wish to witness, I suggest you go to the city.

## Talk 2

Verr Goldet: Sounds like you and Xiao took care of business again.
Huai'an: Word certainly got around, the news even reached us here.
Verr Goldet: *sigh* And yet, another year's Lantern Rite will soon be over, and he still won't go and take a look...
Huai'an: *sigh* ...All these long years and I've never seen him attend the Lantern Rite.
Huai'an: I'd go as far as to say, it'd be easier bringing the festival to him than the other way around...
Paimon: Bring the festival to him... Hmm...
Traveler: Nice idea.
Paimon: Yeah! If Xiao won't go to the Lantern Rite, then let's bring the Lantern Rite to him!
Huai'an: ...Sorry? Surely you realize I was joking... How would you "bring the Lantern Rite to him," exactly?
Paimon: When we were in the city checking out the festivities, we learned how to make Xiao Lanterns. We even found a food stall serving local delicacies...
Paimon: So much tasty food, so many pretty Xiao lanterns, not to mention... um... what else... Oh, the bygone heroes, his old friends.
Paimon: Aren't those the heart and soul of the Lantern Rite?
Verr Goldet: You're not wrong, but where would we set all that up...?
Huai'an: Now that you mention it, I wonder... We'd need enough space to set up our own stall. Hmm... There might just be enough room <color=#00E1FFFF>below the inn</color>.
Huai'an: Let's take a look and choose a space. I believe I know the kind of stall you're after...
Huai'an: Hmm, there should be a few styles we can reference, let me think...

## Talk 3

Huai'an: Here's not too bad... and it's safely away from all the foot traffic. A fitting choice.
Huai'an: We've got ourselves a nice spot, now we need to build a proper stall. I've thought about it, and I believe I know roughly how to go about it.
Huai'an: If you'll excuse me for a moment, I'll try to figure out where to start...
Huai'an: And voila! A little rough around the edges, but it should serve us well. What do you think?
Traveler: I think you've missed your true calling! Such expert carpentry...
Huai'an: It was no big deal! Just a little bit of DIY that I picked up years ago. I've forgotten most of it, actually.
Huai'an: Well, we can check the stall off our to-do list. It looks quite festive decorated with that Xiao Lantern, wouldn't you say?
Traveler: You know how to make Xiao Lanterns too?
Huai'an: Well yes, but in my generation, it's just the norm for everyone who grew up in Liyue.
Huai'an: Anyway, speaking of festivities... No celebration is complete without a feast. Do you know what you would like on the menu?
Paimon: Almond Tofu, that's for sure! We've made it for Xiao before.
Traveler: And Grilled Tiger Fish.
Huai'an: Almond Tofu and Grilled Tiger Fish, hmm... What an interesting combination of flavors! I'll have a word with Smiley Yanxiao.
Huai'an: He should be able to rustle those up in no time. Luckily, the inn's pantry contains all the necessary ingredients.
Huai'an: Oh, it's about time to summon our honored guest. Could you fetch him? The food should be ready by the time you come down.

## Talk 4

Xiao: What now?
Traveler: We'd like you to come to Lantern Rite with us.
Xiao: ...We've had the talk about crowded places. Do not make me repeat myself. Best you go alone.
Traveler: I didn't say you have to go to Liyue Harbor.
Xiao: ...What is that supposed to mean?
Traveler: You wouldn't go to the festival, so we brought the festival to you.
Xiao: You "brought the festival to me"?
Paimon: Okay, so there's a bunch of delicious snacks just laid out below the inn, and a bunch of Xiao lanterns, and there's practically no one else around to have to worry about.
Traveler: There's even Almond Tofu and Grilled Tiger Fish...
Paimon: Better hurry up or the food's gonna go cold. Come on down!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Ta-da! Your very own, miniature Lantern Rite festival! Well if it doesn't look mouth-watering...
Xiao: So this is what you meant by bringing the festival to me... *sigh* Is there no end to the peculiarities of human behavior?
Xiao: Does it serve any grander purpose?
Traveler: This way you can take part in Lantern Rite.
Xiao: ...Is that so? Hmph, human motives defy my attempts to fathom them.
Paimon: Less fathoming, more eating! Come on, dig in, before it gets cold!
Paimon: Mmm-mmm, okay, Paimon's gonna concentrate on eating now.
Paimon: Ahh... Now that we're done with the most important part of the celebration, we should be heading out to see the Mingxiao Lantern.
Traveler: Come with us, Xiao.
Xiao: You may take your leave. There's nothing for me over there.
Traveler: You might as well keep us company on the way there.
Paimon: Yeah, the Mingxiao Lantern may not be your thing, but... surely, there's no harm in taking a walk with us.
Paimon: The road from here to Liyue Harbor is long and full of dangers... We need someone to ensure our safety!
Paimon: Nobody says you have to enter the city... You can just see us off at the outskirts.
Xiao: ...
Xiao: ...Hmph.
Xiao: So be it. I shall accept your proposal.
Paimon: There you go! Alright, time to hit the road!
Traveler: O Vigilant Yaksha, please escort us safely to the city.
Traveler: Lantern Rite is meant to include everyone.

## Talk 6

Xiao: This is as far as I will go. Please see yourselves into the city.
Traveler: Wait a second.
Xiao: What now?
Paimon: You are obviously one of the heroes this festival is all about... Why don't you want to get involved?
Xiao: I... detest the rabble.
Xiao: No cares in the world, so peaceful, so joyful... They are nothing like me.
Xiao: Too long have I spent slaughtering, accompanied by the burden of suffering that follows in its wake. Crossing paths with all those jubilant people will only make me...
Xiao: ...That's all I have to say.
Xiao: Farewell.
Traveler: Are you sure you don't want to go with us?
Xiao: Are you really so enamored with such trivial amusements?
Traveler: What do you think?
Paimon: Hey! This is a legitimate festival, not some trivial amusement!
Xiao: ...Legitimate...
Xiao: Enough. Go watch your lanterns.
Xiao: But stay vigilant. Keep your eyes open for any menace. If you find yourself in trouble... speak my name.
Traveler: Sure you'd make it into the city in time to come to the rescue?
Xiao: Anywhere. Anytime.
Xiao: Whether yours or Liyue's, I hear all cries for help, all prayers for peace, and all the wishes carried by the lanterns.
Traveler: (...Never mind, he can see it from here.)
