# Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part II


## Talk 1

Liloupar: This fellow's actions are quite suspicious... not to mention overeager...
Jeht: Azariq... No, it's nothing...

## Talk 2

Azariq: Look, this is it!
Paimon: Whoa! It's huge...
Jeht: Hmph! This kind of scrap can be dug up everywhere in the desert. Why did you ask us to come here specifically? Are we gonna play at war inside or something?
Azariq: Be patient, little wildcat. This one's interior is in perfect condition! We can activate it and use it to cross those dangerous quicksand-filled areas!
Liloupar: Hmph... A tribesman who knows the inner workings of machinery? An eye-opener, to be sure.
Jeht: ...
Traveler: Azariq, how do you know how to activate it?
Traveler: Jeht, what's on your mind?
Azariq: The blueprints Aderfi left behind recorded the mechanical structure of this thing. It wasn't difficult to understand that structure with the basic knowledge that I have.
Azariq: Maybe those northerners from the snowy lands gave it to him in a trade... Who knows what he would've wanted this for, though...
Jeht: Azariq, you knew all these things... But you never once told me about them.
Azariq: *sigh* Don't get mad at me, little wildcat.
Azariq: Relax. You know I won't hide anything from you! I'll tell you the full story once this journey is over.
Jeht: ...
Azariq: #C'mon, I'm here to help! {NICKNAME}, you're a knowledgeable sort. You must have seen this sort of machine before, right?
Traveler: We've seen one in the rainforest before.
Paimon: Ah, you mean that giant iron mountain! And we even studied it with Ararycan and Jazari, didn't we?
Jeht: I've seen similar machines in the desert before as well. But this is the first time I've seen one that's this intact.
Jeht: Dad once said that these are war machines left over from 500 years ago... I can't help but wonder what actually happened in that era...
Paimon: But this big guy seems... a little different from the one we saw before.
Azariq: Huh... Interesting. Let's just go in through its arm first, shall we?

## Talk 3

Azariq: Look, this is it!
Paimon: Whoa! It's huge...
Jeht: Hmph! This kind of scrap can be dug up everywhere in the desert. Why did you ask us to come here specifically? Are we gonna play at war inside or something?
Azariq: Be patient, little wildcat. This one's interior is in perfect condition! We can activate it and use it to cross those dangerous quicksand-filled areas!

Azariq: Relax. You know I won't hide anything from you! I'll tell you the full story once this journey is over.
Jeht: ...
Azariq: #C'mon, I'm here to help! {NICKNAME}, you're a knowledgeable sort. You must have seen this sort of machine before, right?
Traveler: It's a war machine left by the people of Dahri.
Jeht: I've seen some machines like this in the desert before, but they're not quite the same... This is the first time I've seen one so complete.
Jeht: Dad also once said that these are war machines left over from 500 years ago... I can't help but wonder what actually happened in that era...
Azariq: From 500 years ago? Interesting... Almost all records of that period have been destroyed, insofar as I've read.
Traveler: You could put it like that...
Traveler: It's a long story...
Paimon: Uh, Paimon can't quite explain it... Anyway, it was a long, long time ago!
Paimon: Come to think of it, this big guy does look different from the one we saw before.
Azariq: Huh... Interesting. Let's just go in through its arm first, shall we?

## Talk 4

Paimon: But it hasn't been turned on in quite a while, has it? That might cause some problems...

## Talk 5

Jeht: Wow... So this iron ball could make such a huge hole...
Paimon: It's more like a rift than the entrance to a cave...
Azariq: If we can bring this thing back to the tribe, it will definitely be of great use.
Jeht: And what would you do, take Matriarch Babel out for a joyride?

## Talk 6

Jeht: Hey, check this out! I've never seen flowers like these before... They're so beautiful, but it's kinda unsettling for them to appear like this in the desert.
Liloupar: These flowers belong to the mistress... After she fell into a deep slumber, they were said to have disappeared into the desert... I didn't expect to see them again here...
Azariq: At least this shows that there must be an environment deep in this cave that allows plant roots to absorb nutrients.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Hey, look, the door over there seems just about ready to open! W—Well... Paimon's intuition says so, anyway!

## Talk 8

Paimon: The door's unlocked!

## Talk 9

Liloupar: I can feel my fragment calling to me. It is just up ahead.
Jeht: What a long tunnel... And those same strange flowers we saw earlier...
Liloupar: This place used to be the mistress's greenhouse, but now, perhaps only these flowers survive.
Azariq: Fascinating... Were these tunnels excavated by humans? I didn't see any steps or paved paths... Everything seems to have been shaped naturally.
Jeht: Perhaps they have all been weathered away... Or perhaps the builders never thought of leaving too many traces of artifice in passages of this kind?
Liloupar: This was once a sacred place, inaccessible to all save the priests... Or so my broken memories tell, should they serve me correctly.
Paimon: There were red crystals in the first tunnel, and this one has all these large purple flowers...
Liloupar: Well, have you noticed? "The Three Eternal Companion-Gods" — that's who this oasis commemorates.
Paimon: Huh...?
Jeht: So the one in whom we Tanit place our faith... Nabu Malikata...
Liloupar: That's my mistress, yes. Now show some respect, little lass.
Liloupar: She slumbers in the Eternal Oasis. This tunnel was dug in her memory.
Azariq: So the relationship between Gurabad and this place...
Liloupar: The Lord charged the mortals' ideal kingdom with guarding his Eternal Oasis. That is why there was a city on the periphery of this dune.
Liloupar: But the city of Gurabad fell into a gap in the sand, and became shrouded by death and oblivion... Well, that's another story.

## Talk 10

Liloupar: It's the fragment... It is just up ahead, my master!

## Talk 11

Jeht: Hmm... The gate here is closed, and there seems to be no other way.
Azariq: There may be clues to open the gate around here. Let's all keep our eyes peeled.

## Talk 12

Azariq: Looks like we'll need to open that gate up there next. As per our previous experience, the pipelines here will probably have to be connected to let the quicksand drive the gate.
Jeht: But the mechanisms next to the pipes seem completely broken...
Azariq: Then we can only see if there's any way to connect the pipes in other places. Hmm... The pipes are supposed to connect the two sides, right? If the mechanism that controls the gate is on one side, then the other side...
Paimon: Oh, Paimon thinks it should lead to that room over there!
Azariq: Alright, let's go and see what's in there first.

## Talk 13

Azariq: Well? Do you want to explore here some more or go back to that big iron ball?
Traveler: (Return to the surface) Let's go back.
Azariq: Alright! Jeht, time to go!
Traveler: I'd like to explore here some more.
Azariq: *sigh* Oh, the curiosity... But, as you wish.

## Talk 14

Black Screen Text: As the shard of light merges with Liloupar's magic bottle, you feel a little of your own power being pulled away...
Black Screen Text: Through the Jinni's entranced eyes, you see a ravenous shepherd boy and a bright red pomegranate...
You see the pomegranate juice flowing freely, like the wine of tyrants, the infatuation of lovers, and the fresh blood of innocent victims...
You see the plump pomegranate being handed to the shepherd boy...
Black Screen Text: "Take a bite and use it to quench your thirst. But be careful not to let it burst in your hands..."
Jeht: #{NICKNAME}, are you okay...?
Paimon: You suddenly froze up again, and you wouldn't respond to anyone... You really scared us there!
Liloupar: #Do not fret, {M#he}{F#she} is fine.
Traveler: Don't worry, Jeht. I just zoned out for a bit.
Paimon: Phew, okay... Stop scaring us like that, though!
Liloupar: My apologies if my troubled memories bothered you. But thanks to your help, my power has been restored... partly, in any case.
Liloupar: Pomegranates... Ah, pomegranates... The sweet fruit made from the congealed blood of the victimized... Should I have the chance to share it with you, my master, I surely will.
Liloupar: How I desire to see the plump arils burst between your teeth, and how the rich juice overflows from your lips...
Paimon: Uh... That does sound delicious, but Paimon doesn't think she's talking about fruit...
Jeht: ...
Jeht: Ahem, we should go. There're still many mechanisms waiting for us ahead.
Liloupar: Now, now, little girl, are you sulking again?
Jeht: I'm not! I just said we should go!
Azariq: Careful, the little wildcat is about to bite.
Jeht: ...!
Traveler: Don't worry, Paimon. I'll be fine.
Paimon: Ugh, fine, if you say so! Jeht was also really worried about you, you know?

## Talk 15

Jeht: #{NICKNAME}, have you found anything?
Paimon: Not yet! What about you?
Traveler: Have you found anything?
Jeht: Not really... But I think we just need to move along the walls as we search.
Traveler: About Azariq...
Jeht: ...What about him?
Jeht: Well... I know you may have doubts about him, but he's Matriarch Babel's most trusted subordinate, so it does us no good being suspicious all the time.
Jeht: That said, he does know a little too much, which makes me uneasy... But that's just a gut feeling, you know?
Liloupar: Ah, but intuition can be quite accurate sometimes...

## Talk 16

Jeht: Alright... Now it looks like there's only one passage left for us to open.
Paimon: What!? There's more!? Paimon's legs are already sore!
Jeht: Oh? And you know this because you walk on your own two feet?
Paimon: #Uh... Nah! Paimon was just, uh, speaking for {NICKNAME}! Yeah! Y—You must be tired, right?
Traveler: Not really.
Jeht: #Haha, {NICKNAME} is a veteran adventurer after all. You'd better exercise more, or {M#he'll}{F#she'll} leave you behind sooner or later.
Paimon: #N—No way! {NICKNAME} will definitely wait for Paimon, no matter what...
Liloupar: Hmm... My memory is gradually coming together. I can now guide you to the next location.
Traveler: Ooh, I'm beat. Super beat.
Paimon: #See? What did Paimon tell you? We've walked for so long that even {NICKNAME}'s tired!
Jeht: #Hahaha! {M#He}{F#She} was just messing with you. This much walking is hardly a challenge for a veteran adventurer, you know?
Jeht: But if you're really so tired, Paimon, why don't you let me carry you around? Hehehe.
Paimon: N—No need! That would just be embarrassing...

## Talk 17

Jeht: #{NICKNAME}, are we leaving now?
Traveler: (Return to the surface) Let's go.
Jeht: Alright! Azariq, time to go!
Traveler: I'd like to stay here a little longer.
Jeht: Please be careful. We'll wait for you here.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Azariq: There should be a mechanism around here that can help open the gate. Let's all keep our eyes peeled.
Traveler: You sure are knowledgeable, Azariq.
Azariq: It's completely normal. Like I said, I have many friends on the outside and I've learned a lot from them... Don't you underestimate us tribespeople, alright?
Traveler: Have you found anything?
Azariq: Hmm... If I were you, I'd start from those pipelines. After all, that's the one thing we've no shortage of.

### Additional Talk 2

Azariq: Look, this is it!
Paimon: Whoa! It's huge...
Jeht: Hmph! This kind of scrap can be dug up everywhere in the desert. Why did you ask us to come here specifically? Are we gonna play at war inside or something?
Azariq: Be patient, little wildcat. This one's interior is in perfect condition! We can activate it and use it to cross those dangerous quicksand-filled areas!
Liloupar: Hmph... A tribesman who knows the inner workings of machinery? An eye-opener, to be sure.
