# Jahan's Sugar


## Talk 1

Traveler: About the Sugar...
Jahan: Oh, you are here to deliver the Sugar, right?
Jahan: Did you get five jars of Sugar?
Traveler: Here is the sugar you wanted.
Traveler: Not yet.
Jahan: You can never get enough sugar. Who doesn't love the sweet taste?
Jahan: But don't eat too much like me. I cannot be held responsible for your tooth decay.
