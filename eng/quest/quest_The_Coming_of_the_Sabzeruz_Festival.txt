# The Coming of the Sabzeruz Festival


## Talk 1

Paimon: There she is! Dunyarzad, we're back!
Dunyarzad: Just as promised, Traveler and Paimon! I'm so glad that you two came back to celebrate Lesser Lord Kusanali's birthday.
Traveler: Looks like we made it back in time.
Dunyarzad: Hehe, indeed! The festival is tomorrow. We have been preparing for so long that I can't help but feel a little nervous.
Paimon: There's no need to be nervous! Paimon's sure that Lesser Lord Kusanali will feel everyone's gratitude.
Dunyarzad: Hehe, thanks, Paimon. I hope that everyone who comes to the festival will also have a good time.
Dunyarzad: Speaking of which, did you manage to make your way to Port Ormos? Discover anything over there?
Paimon: Of course we went! A lot of things happened there...
Traveler: Unfortunately, we didn't find any new information on Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Dunyarzad: *sigh* I see. Sounds like you two had another exciting adventure...
Dunyarzad: ...If there is another chance, I would love to join...
Dehya: *sigh* My lady, if you went to Port Ormos in your current state, we'd both be in for a lifetime of trouble.
Paimon: Dehya! You were eavesdropping!
Dehya: Ahem, it's called covert protection! Keeping an ear out for what's going on around my employer is part of the job.
Dunyarzad: It's alright, Dehya. I merely said that I "would" like to go. I know better than to think my body could handle it, hehe.
Dunyarzad: The festival is tomorrow. I've been doing nothing but causing trouble for you, so Dehya, please take some time to relax. I'll be fine.
Dehya: ...Hm, even when you put it that way, it still doesn't feel right...
Dunyarzad: Don't worry, my guardian knight.
Dehya: Okay, fine, but only tonight. Tomorrow's a big day, and many no-good scumbags are gonna take advantage of that.
Paimon: *yawn*
Dunyarzad: Oh, you two must be exhausted from your long journey back to the city. My apologies for not realizing this sooner.
Dunyarzad: I've already prepared a room for you to rest. Please follow me.
Paimon: Whoa, you're so thoughtful! Paimon's so ready!
Traveler: Instead, we were only left with more questions...
Traveler: It's a very important festival, after all.

## Talk 2

Dunyarzad: Traveler, Paimon! I've been waiting for you two.
Paimon: Good morning, Dunyarzad! We must've overslept a little bit, hehe.
Dunyarzad: Not at all. I arrived early.
Dunyarzad: Phew... Today is finally here! I must cherish every moment as if it were gold.
Paimon: You've worked so hard for this day. You gotta enjoy it to the fullest!
Dunyarzad: Hehe, you know it! It's just that... as expected, I had some trouble falling asleep last night. I'm hoping my body won't be too much of an issue today.
Dunyarzad: Well, shall we? Let's start with the stalls over there.

## Talk 3

Amal: I picked all of these from the forest yesterday, so their freshness is guaranteed!

## Talk 4

Kimiya: The diviner's interpretation is the most important part of alchemical divination. I just consulted the book to make sure you got the correct message.

## Talk 5

Dunyarzad: This is... a stall offering foods from the Haft-Mewa Feast.
Amal: Oh-ho, you could tell straight away! I thought most people nowadays wouldn't know.
Paimon: Mushrooms, flowers, and all kinds of fruit... It's all vegetarian stuff. Paimon's a little disappointed...
Paimon: So what's the "Haft-Mewa Feast" you mentioned just now?
Dunyarzad: It's another Sabzeruz Festival tradition. People used to set their tables with seven different foods...
Dunyarzad: Generally speaking, the most common selections were foods like Rukkhashava Mushrooms, Nilotpala Lotuses, Sumeru Roses, Sunsettias, Kalpalatas, Harra Fruits, and Zaytun Peaches.
Paimon: So the Sabzeruz Festival is a vegetarian holiday...
Dunyarzad: Hehe... You don't have to be a vegetarian to enjoy the spread. We just use the seven foods to symbolize the seven virtues of the Dendro Archon.
Paimon: Wait, but if that's the case... If Sumeru uses vegetarian food to represent the Dendro Archon...
Paimon: Then wouldn't the Pyro Archon's festival be full of food like roasted fowl, juicy meatballs, grilled steak...
Paimon: Traveler, we have to go to Natlan as soon as possible!
Dunyarzad: Hahaha... I hope your wish comes true one day, Paimon.
Paimon: Thanks! Alright, how about we also check out some of these other stalls?
Kimiya: Dear customers, would you like to try your hand at alchemical divination?
Paimon: What's alchemical divination? Those two things sound like they'd be fun to try together.
Kimiya: Right? I thought the same when I first heard about it. It is said to be a mysterious craft invented by none other than Lesser Lord Kusanali herself.
Paimon: So... how does it work?
Kimiya: It's quite simple. After you give me any two alchemical reagents, I'll use them to perform a random transmutation.
Paimon: Sure sounds random... So random that it'll probably fail.
Kimiya: That is precisely what we need. After the transmutation fails, your one and only diviner here will interpret the remnants.
Traveler: For some reason... I don't buy it.
Dunyarzad: Well... According to Lesser Lord Kusanali, everything is interconnected, and all that occurs can be traced back to fate. You can say this is a pearl of old wisdom.
Paimon: Why does everything sound so much more credible when Dunyarzad says it? Are you guys working together?
Kimiya: So that's the true wisdom behind it! This young lady sure knows her stuff. So, how about it? Want to give it a try?
Traveler: Alright, I guess I can give it a go.
Traveler: This entire thing is way too random.

## Talk 6

Vihar: Atten-tion! Young soldiers, are you here to join our ranks?

## Talk 7

Kimiya: Okay, one moment... Hmm... It's the Moon.
Paimon: Paimon wants to take a look too... Is it...? It looks more like a pie that Paimon bit into.
Kimiya: Hmm... Generally speaking, the Moon signifies... It means... Wait a moment...
Paimon: Is he really looking it up in a book...
Kimiya: Oh, I remember now. It means illusions and lies.
Dunyarzad: Illusions and lies...? That sounds rather ominous...
Kimiya: Yes, but this book says that if you trust your intuition and overcome your fears, the sun will surely rise.
Paimon: He's not even trying to hide his book anymore.
Dunyarzad: ...Naturally, fate will only ever show you the beginning of a journey. It is up to you to forge your own ending. Hehe, thank you so much. I'll keep that in mind.
Kimiya: Oh, it's nothing. I'm just learning as I go, haha... ha...
Paimon: Guess that was still pretty interesting. Okay, on to the next stall.

## Talk 8

Phaki: Farris! Farris!
Vihar: Atten-tion! Soldiers, fall into formation if you want any Yalda Candies!
Paimon: It's a weird guy with a weird hat.
Phaki: Hey, it's Dunyarzad!
Vihar: Hahaha... Miss Dunyarzad, the children love you even more than Yalda Candies.
Vihar: In the few short days it took to prepare for the Sabzeruz Festival, the children have all grown very fond of you.
Dunyarzad: Uh... Ah, hallowed Knight of Flowers, it is an honor that you know my name!
Vihar: A—Ah, ahem... Atten-tion! In the name of Farris, the Knight of Flowers, I commend you on your contributions to the glorious Sabzeruz Festival.
Vihar: Alright, little soldiers, take your Yalda Candies and don't forget your loyalty to Lesser Lord Kusanali. Dismissed!
Phaki: Yes, Knight Farris!
Paimon: Uh... Just what is going on here...
Dunyarzad: Hehe. Farris, the Knight of Flowers, is another Sabzeruz Festival icon, and one immensely popular with children. In the past, the actor portraying Farris would also sit on a flower carriage.
Vihar: It's all thanks to Miss Dunyarzad's sponsorship that the children can make such wonderful memories today.
Dunyarzad: As are we to you, Vihar.
Vihar: Not at all! Oh, speaking of tradition, do you want some Yalda Candies? They're a festival staple, and I happen to have some boxes readied here. Take a look and pick whichever one you want.
Paimon: Whichever one... Don't these boxes all look the same?
Vihar: Haha, this is the fun part. Each box contains a random flavor — it's up to the luck of the draw. Flavors include Lavender Melon, Harra Fruit, Sunsettia...
Paimon: Ooh, those all sound pretty good...
Vihar: ...And there's also Lizard Tail and Onikabuto.
Paimon: Huh!? What's up with those two flavors?
Dunyarzad: Onikabuto is a little spicier than Lizard Tail.
Paimon: Dunyarzad, y—you tried them before! Hmm... Traveler, help Paimon pick one. Paimon wants the Sunsettia flavor!
Traveler: I doubt I'll be able to get the exact flavor you want...
Paimon: It's alright, Paimon believes in you!
Dunyarzad: Hehe, I also believe in your intuition.
Vihar: Great! These boxes of candy are numbered one to five from left to right. Which one do you want?
Traveler: Number one.
Traveler: It's definitely number one.
Vihar: Atten-tion! That's unfortunately Lizard Tail.
Paimon: *sigh* Paimon thought you survived so many epic battles because you had incredible luck, but looks like Paimon was wrong.
Vihar: The Sunsettia-flavored candy was in box number four. How about this? The most important thing is that everyone has a good time at the festival, so please take both boxes!
Paimon: Really!? Thanks a lot, Knight of Candies!
Vihar: It's Knight of Flowers! Not Knight of Candies!
Dunyarzad: Hehe... Paimon really wilted the carriage-less Knight of Flowers.
Paimon: They all basically sound the same! We got our candy, so let's keep going.
Dunyarzad: Oh, actually, I just remembered that I left something behind. Since you're here...
Dunyarzad: Can you come with me to get it?
Traveler: Not a problem.
Paimon: Dunyarzad, you probably forgot because you're so excited about the Sabzeruz Festival!
Dunyarzad: Haha, how embarrassing.
Traveler: Sure thing.
Traveler: Let me give it a little thought...
Traveler: Number two.
Traveler: It's definitely number two.
Vihar: Atten-tion! That's unfortunately Harra Fruit.
Traveler: Number three.
Traveler: It's definitely number three.
Vihar: Atten-tion! That's unfortunately Lavender Melon.
Traveler: Number four.
Traveler: It's definitely number four.
Vihar: Haha, excellent work! That is indeed Sunsettia.
Paimon: Paimon bet you survived so many epic battles because you had incredible luck, and Paimon was right!
Vihar: Atten-tion! Here's your Sunsettia-flavored candy!
Paimon: Hehe, thanks a lot, Knight of Candies!
Traveler: Number five.
Traveler: It's definitely number five.
Vihar: Atten-tion! That's unfortunately Onikabuto.
Traveler: Don't blame me if I choose the wrong one.

## Talk 9

Guard: Hey! Stop right there! No one is allowed to enter or leave Sumeru City right now. Go away!
Paimon: Whoa... Ugh, okay.

## Talk 10

Badis: ...Tch, we're too late. Who knew the little lady was such an early riser.
Idder: I know, right... Hey, wait a minute. Boss, isn't that her?
Badis: Oh, that most certainly is! We're in luck. She's walking right into our clutches.
Paimon: Those Eremites don't look like they're up to any good...
Dunyarzad: ...Who are you? I don't believe the Homayanis hired you?
Badis: Heh, that's right. We haven't received any of their Mora, but... I wonder how much the Homayanis would shell out to get you back?
Paimon: They're a gang of kidnappers! Traveler, hurry and protect Dunyarzad!
Traveler: We'll be fine...
Dehya: Hey! Did you scumbags even consider that the Homayanis might've hired a merc that outclasses you?
Badis: You're... Dehya!? Dehya the Flame-Mane... No wonder we mercs haven't heard anything about you for so long. You sold your unruly mane to the highest bidder.
Dunyarzad: Don't speak so disrespectfully. My family started working with her as gratitude for her past kindness to us...
Dehya: Don't worry about it, my lady. Just some friendly banter between mercs. One punch and those rabid dogs will expose themselves for what they really are.
Badis: Hmph, aren't your claws all dull by now? Don't get too cocky!
Dehya: Traveler, take Miss Dunyarzad to a safe location.
Paimon: No, we're gonna stay and help. There's too many of them!
Traveler: We can't guarantee anyone's safety here.
Paimon: Hm... You're right. Alright, fine!
Dunyarzad: Please be careful, Dehya.
Dehya: Don't waste your time worrying about me — this is my job. Look out for yourself. After I've wiped the floor with them, I'll go find you all.
Traveler: Dehya's top priority is her employer's safety.
Traveler: Professional here, ready to go.

## Talk 11

Guard: Hey! Stop right there! No one is allowed to enter or leave Sumeru City right now. Go away!
Paimon: Whoa... Ugh, okay.

## Talk 12

Guard: Hey! Stop right there! No one is allowed to enter or leave Sumeru City right now. Go away!
Paimon: Whoa... Ugh, okay.

## Talk 13

Merchant: *sigh* How am I supposed to conduct business when I'm not allowed to leave the city?

## Talk 14

Merchant: *sigh* How am I supposed to conduct business when I'm not allowed to leave the city?

## Talk 15

Merchant: *sigh* How am I supposed to conduct business when I'm not allowed to leave the city?

Paimon: Whoa... Ugh, okay.

## Talk 19

Dunyarzad: *cough* *cough*
Paimon: Dunyarzad, are you okay? You look a little pale. Are you in shock?
Dunyarzad: I—I'm fine... My body always reacts like this whenever I exert myself too much...
Paimon: You sure you're okay...?
Dunyarzad: Phew... I'll be fine after some rest. I'm more worried about Dehya... After all, none of this would've happened if I hadn't insisted on coming out today...
Traveler: Don't worry, she's tough.
Paimon: Yeah, don't worry!
Black Screen Text: You and Dunyarzad wait nearby for a while...
Dehya: My lady, Traveler, found ya.
Paimon: Dehya! You took care of 'em so fast.
Dehya: Any more of them? Or rather, did anyone follow you?
Traveler: No, I just checked.
Dunyarzad: Dehya, your arm...!
Dehya: Oh, this? I'm fine — it's just a scratch. Normally, they wouldn't have been able to land a hit on me at all, but I'm still getting used to this new greatsword.
Dunyarzad: Please let me take a closer look...
Dehya: C'mon, it's nothing. Us mercs aren't as fragile as you think.
Dunyarzad: Hold on, you said something about a new greatsword? What happened to the one you were using before?
Dehya: Uh... About that... Well... I sold it 'cause I was low on Mora. Stuff like this happens every now and then.
Dunyarzad: It can't be... The anonymous donation that was used for the venue's final round of preparations...
Dehya: *sigh* Hehe...
Dunyarzad: ...
Dehya: Uh, hey, Miss Dunyarzad, I wasn't trying to make you cry. I'm not gonna lose my commission because I made my employer cry, am I?
Dunyarzad: ...Pfft... Hehe... Okay, making your employer cry won't affect your commission, but selling your weapon without permission and getting hurt... I'll have to re-evaluate your performance.
Dehya: Hahaha... You're so unreasonable, my lady.
Dunyarzad: Hahaha...
Dunyarzad: ...Thank you very much, Dehya.
Dehya: ... *sigh* Don't be like that. I get embarrassed really easily.
Dunyarzad: *cough* *cough*
Paimon: Are you feeling unwell again, Dunyarzad?
Dehya: My lady, your condition... Traveler, can you take her somewhere to rest? I'll look around the area to make sure we're safe from an ambush.
Traveler: No problem.
Dunyarzad: Truly... I'm sorry for the trouble, everyone...
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Traveler: She's protecting you because she agrees with you.

## Talk 20

Dunyarzad: *pant* Phew...
Paimon: Are you feeling better, Dunyarzad?
Dunyarzad: Yes, much better. Just give me a few moments, and I'll be good to go.
Traveler: Dehya's expression just now, when she mentioned your condition...
Dunyarzad: ...I didn't realize you were concerned about it. I guess I shouldn't continue to keep it a secret.
Dunyarzad: I was actually... born with Eleazar. It's terminal now.
Traveler: Eleazar!
Paimon: Can't believe it's Eleazar...
Dunyarzad: Oh? You've already heard of Eleazar. In that case, you probably know about its severity.
Dunyarzad: Sumeru's current medical advancements still haven't been able to find a cure. The disease's progression can only be delayed through environmental therapy...
Paimon: Dunyarzad...
Dunyarzad: There's no need to be sad. I've always lived with Eleazar, and I came to terms with it a long time ago.
Dunyarzad: Compared to the simple fact that I am afflicted with this, its effects on my life have been much more painful.
Dunyarzad: I know that my family loves me dearly. They've done all they can to provide the best environment for me, so that I can live for that much longer. However, I know... I will one day succumb to this.
Traveler: ...
Dunyarzad: Did you know? Before I ran away from home this time... the world outside of my home didn't even know that I existed.
Dunyarzad: Since I was a child, all I could do was sit on my bed and stare at everything outside of my window.
Dunyarzad: I'm sure my family is worried and disappointed in me for running away, but I... I just didn't wanna have any regrets.
Dunyarzad: I wanted to meet other people. To me, there is nothing more beautiful than being able to meet and speak with others.
Dunyarzad: Not to mention the incredible time spent preparing for the festival, the joy on everyone's faces here, and all the support I've received from friends like Dehya...
Dunyarzad: This way, when my final day does arrive, it will be less sorrowful.
Dunyarzad: At the very least, many people will remember that I once existed in this world, right?
Traveler: Yes. I will remember you.
Paimon: A—As long as you don't forget Paimon, Paimon also won't forget about you! Ah... No, even if you forget Paimon, Paimon will still remember you!
Dunyarzad: Hehe... Thank you two so much. I apologize for the depressing conversation. This is... This is out-of-character for me.
Dunyarzad: To be honest, Lesser Lord Kusanali gave me the courage to do all of this. If it weren't for her encouragement, I wouldn't have taken that first step.
Traveler: You're the one who has remained resolute in the face of your illness.
Dunyarzad: ...Thanks. There will always be frustrations in life, but I know that the point of living is not to leave behind any regrets.
Traveler: Right.
Dunyarzad: Oh, right! Isn't it almost time?
Paimon: Huh? Almost time for what?
Dunyarzad: Isn't the Dance of Sabzeruz about to begin? It's the part of the festival that I've been looking forward to the most...
Dunyarzad: Nilou will recreate that legendary scene with her most splendid dancing, and the Sabzeruz Festival will conclude amid everyone's applause and blessings...
Dunyarzad: And with that, my wish will also...
Paimon: Then what are we waiting for? Let's go to the stage!
Dunyarzad: ...Yeah! We should still make it in time!
Traveler: That's a wonderful mindset.
Traveler: You're already so strong for never giving up.
Traveler: Don't say that. You still have happy times yet to come.
Traveler: Just how serious is your illness?

## Talk 21

Setaria: ...Were you not aware that the law prohibits this type of performance from taking place without prior permission?
Paimon: Over there... Someone's yelling at Nilou.
Dunyarzad: I think I just saw the Akademiya's Grand Sage... Why is he here in person?
Nilou: But the Dance of Sabzeruz is one of the key parts of the Sabzeruz Festival. If we can't perform it...
Setaria: The Sabzeruz Festival... The law also prohibits the private hosting of large-scale, religious festivals. Only the Akademiya can host such an event.
Setaria: If you continue to resist, we will have to order an investigation into every single event organizer...
Setaria: The Grand Sage has already granted you much leniency. I advise that you exercise tact.
Nilou: How... How did things turn out like this...
Dunyarzad: The Akademiya was originally responsible for the Sabzeruz Festival, but they've failed this responsibility for many years. I need to speak with them...
Traveler: Don't go. They have the final say in all of this.
Dunyarzad: ...This is a hard pill to swallow, but... sigh, you're right. Things would only get worse.
Azar: Art... Dance... Aren't you ashamed of pursuing such frivolous and meaningless activities in this land of knowledge and reason?
Azar: Our Archon created the utopia that is Sumeru City for all scholars who sought validity, verity, and truth... while people like you wish to defile it.
Nilou: No, I believe that our Archon never rejected the arts. Even the Goddess of Flowers dedicated a dance to her...
Azar: With your lack of intellectual credentials, I do not believe you are qualified to debate with me. What you should be doing is finding workers to tear down this ridiculous eyesore.
Azar: When we return, have the Scribe draft an ordinance before the next Jnagarbha Day that prohibits public art performances. We will announce it to the public later via the Akasha.
Setaria: Understood. I will inform him when I return.
Azar: ...
Azar: The Sabzeruz Festival... Go celebrate the birth of that god to your heart's content.
Paimon: Nilou, are you okay?
Nilou: Oh, Dunyarzad. You all saw that just now...? The Grand Sage ordered us to stop the performance...
Dunyarzad: Yeah...
Nilou: Let's go somewhere the Akademiya can't find us and perform there... Ahh, but how do we let everyone know... And what about the atmosphere and the stage...
Nilou: Or we could get people to block them off so they can't interrupt the performance... Agh... No, they just threatened to investigate the organizers. If we were caught...
Dunyarzad: Nilou, it's alright. Don't worry about it.
Nilou: But you've been looking forward to the Dance of Sabzeruz so much, and I know how important this festival is to you. I don't want you to have any regrets...
Dunyarzad: It's okay. Seeing you care this much about my feelings is more than enough.
Dunyarzad: It would be too risky to continue the Sabzeruz Festival at this point. I don't want to get everyone in trouble...
Nilou: ...If you say so, but... You can sneak out for the next Sabzeruz Festival, right? We'll make sure the next one is a smashing success!
Dunyarzad: *sigh* The next one...
Dunyarzad: ...Yes! Okay, it's a promise! It WILL be a smashing success!
Paimon: Paimon can't believe this is how things turned out. Those heartless geezers...
Traveler: Is there anything else we can do?
Dunyarzad: It really is okay. There's nothing we can do about it.
Dunyarzad: *sigh* Still... I'd be lying if I said I had no regrets. I would have loved to see Nilou's dance.
Black Screen Text: The Sabzeruz Festival was forced to come to an unfortunately abrupt end...
Traveler: Should we try to think of another way?
Traveler: If we force their hand too much, the situation may get ugly.

## Talk 22

Paimon: *sigh* A lot happened today... It's a shame the festival ended the way it did...
Paimon: Nilou and Dunyarzad promised to make the next Sabzeruz Festival a success... But Dunyarzad is running out of time...
Traveler: I'm sure she knows that very well.
Paimon: Yeah... *sigh*
Paimon: It's getting late, and we got up really early today. Let's head back and rest...
Paimon: *beep*
Khajeh: All connections have been secured to construct the most stable framework possible.
Khajeh: The project has entered its most critical phase. Power has begun to flow from __.
Traveler: This may be a regret that can never be resolved.

## Talk 23

Dunyarzad: Here we are. It's also fairly close to where I've been staying.
Paimon: It looks really nice!
Traveler: Sorry for the trouble, Dunyarzad.
Dunyarzad: Hehe, not at all. Just tell me more about your adventures when you next get the chance.
Paimon: That's Paimon's specialty! Paimon can tell you stories next time!
Traveler: About our plans for tomorrow...
Dunyarzad: Oh, if you don't mind, how about we all walk around together tomorrow?
Dunyarzad: All of my friends will be working the festival, and Dehya is still insisting on her "covert" protection...
Paimon: Yeah? It'll be pretty hard to relax and enjoy the festival if Dehya's constantly hovering over you, right?
Traveler: I'll keep you company tomorrow.
Dunyarzad: Then let's meet at the nearby bazaar first thing tomorrow morning. Have a great night!
Paimon: It's a deal! Good night, Dunyarzad!
Dunyarzad: I may be too excited to fall asleep tonight. See you tomorrow.
Paimon: Paimon's starting to really look forward to the Sabzeruz Festival, too! Will there be lots of yummy food?
Paimon: Oh no, no... Thinking about food is just gonna keep Paimon up all night. The earlier we sleep, the better. Let's go inside, Traveler.
Traveler: It'll be easier to get information with your help.

## Talk 24

Amal: I picked all of these from the forest yesterday, so their freshness is guaranteed!

## Talk 25

Paimon: *yawn* Did we oversleep...?
Paimon: We should go meet Dunyarzad right away.

## Talk 26

Kimiya: So, how about it? Want to give it a try?

## Talk 27

Kimiya: The diviner's interpretation is the most important part of alchemical divination. I just consulted the book to make sure you got the correct message.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Vihar: Atten-tion! Young soldiers, are you here to join our ranks?
