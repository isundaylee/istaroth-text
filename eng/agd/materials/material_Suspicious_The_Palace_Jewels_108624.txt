# Suspicious The Palace Jewels

A deliciously fragrant Liyue dish. The roughly processed shrimp and half-cooked crab roe give off an odd smell, reeking of the charnel stench of some brutal crab-shrimp war. Considering that the raw ingredients themselves are still quite fresh, this shambling nightmare could still be classified as food... if one were to ignore the stink, anyway.
