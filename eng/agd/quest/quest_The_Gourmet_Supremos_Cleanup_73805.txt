# The Gourmet Supremos: Cleanup

Maryam: Traveler, please wait. Here's a letter for you.
Traveler: A letter for me?
Maryam: Yeah, Xudong left it for you. You know, the guy from Liyue.
Traveler: Where is he now?
Maryam: Beats me. All I know is that he dropped by in a hurry the other day and left this letter.
Maryam: He wanted me to make sure to give it to you. He even offered to pay.
Paimon: Xudong came here... in a hurry? Something must've happened to him, huh.
Paimon: Did that bad guy cause trouble again?
Traveler: Why don't we read the letter first?
Paimon: Okay... Let's see what he wrote.
Traveler: It might tell us what happened.
Traveler: Why did he leave a letter for me?
