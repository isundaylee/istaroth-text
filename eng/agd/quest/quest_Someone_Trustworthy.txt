# Someone Trustworthy


## Talk 1

Mualani: Sorry, we don't carry any black swimming floaters here.
Customer: But why? Black floaters look really cool.
Mualani: Hmm... may I ask whether you've had some bad luck lately?
Customer: Uh, well yeah, sorta... The last pair of black floaters I bought ended up getting bitten by a Koholasaur. I nearly drowned... Which is why I want to buy some new ones.
Mualani: I knew it. I specifically asked an expert from the Masters of the Night-Wind about this once. Black floaters bring bad luck!
Customer: R—Really?
Mualani: Also... have you by any chance become a mosquito magnet? Or found yourself overheating, maybe even suffering a little heatstroke?
Customer: Yeah, that's exactly how I've been feeling! It's all starting to make sense now...
Mualani: In that case, I'd recommend either pink or blue swimming floaters. According to the experts, bright colors can not only lift your mood, but also bring good luck.
Mualani: I'll even offer you a discount if you'd like. Just see it as a way of celebrating your luck taking a turn for the better!
Customer: You'd really do that? Then... I'll take one of each!
Mualani: You got it!
Paimon: ...
Mualani: #Well hello there, if it isn't Traveler and Paimon!
Paimon: It's been a while, Mualani!
Traveler: Good to see you again!
Paimon: Was all that stuff you were saying just now really true? Do pink and blue floaters really bring good luck?
Mualani: Of course! I know a friend who nearly drowned once, but because she was wearing blue floaters, a group of Koholasaurs came to the rescue and brought her back to shore!
Paimon: Whoa, for real?
Mualani: But let's get back to why you're here. Are you looking to buy some watersports products?
Mualani: C'mon, don't be strangers now! I can give you whatever you need, you are guests here, after all. It's only natural for me to give some gifts to you.
Paimon: No, no! We actually came here to ask you to be our guide.
Mualani: Well, you've come to the right person. So where do you wanna go?
Paimon: We want to visit the mysterious island from the legend!
Mualani: A trip to the mysterious island? Oh...
Paimon: Do you have any concerns, Mualani?
Mualani: I assume you're already aware of how difficult the trip will be, right?
Paimon: Yep, your chief has already made that pretty clear!
Paimon: But with our adventuring experience and with you as our guide, we'll definitely be able to reach the mysterious island!
Mualani: Then, I'll have to explain some things to you first.
Mualani: I learned all my skills as a guide from Uncle Nuu, and he's the best guide in the whole tribe. But, apparently, even he has never successfully reached the island.
Mualani: With a good guide to lead the way, a journey should usually be fun and pleasant. However, going to the mysterious island is different, and I don't know if I can guarantee that.
Mualani: But since it's you two asking, I definitely won't refuse.
Mualani: It's just my duty as a guide to explain these things before I officially agree to go on the journey.
Paimon: Paimon thought that this would be a piece of cake for you... But it seems like we're actually asking a lot.
Paimon: Paimon would feel really guilty to make a friend go through a bunch of trouble just for the sake of finding some treasure!
Traveler: Yeah, that's not ideal...
Paimon: Uh, Mualani...
Seketo: Whoa, what's the hurry?
Suya: C'mon, what're you waiting for? Koolau just got back to the tribe! I heard he found another underground ruin full of treasure!
Seketo: Oh, Koolau's back!? Wait for me!
Paimon: Who's Koolau?
Mualani: Oh, he's currently ranked as the number one guide in the People of the Springs. Besides the tribe's first chief, he's the only other guide who's ever made it to the mysterious island.
Paimon: Really?
Mualani: He's always out and about, so we don't get to see him often. Sounds like this is quite an occasion, though. Let's go check it out!
Mualani: Let me put up the closed sign first... Okay, come with me!

## Talk 2

Koolau: The crystals you asked for can only be found in caverns deeper than 500 meters underground. Here, have a look for yourself.
Koolau: As for the people you asked me to take along, they almost all got lost in a cave. Out of my sense of duty as a guide, I've brought them all back.
Koolau: Next time, just save the trouble and let me go alone.
Commissioner: Indeed, well done.
Seketo: No wonder he's the best. I wouldn't dare to go more than 200 meters down into a cavern like that!
Suya: I wonder how much he made this time...
Paimon: Whoa, he really does sound like a super amazing guide. Do you think you could get some pointers from him, Mualani? Who knows, maybe he could save us some trouble on our trip to the mysterious island!
Mualani: Koolau always treats his experience like trade secrets. He never tells anyone anything about being a guide.
Paimon: Oh, okay...
Mualani: But one day, I'll also be able to reach the island.
Karya: That's him, right? Do you really think you'll be able to get his help?
Viramdra: Allow me to do the talking.
Viramdra: You must be the top guide of your tribe. I have a commission that I hope you'd be willing to consider.
Paimon: Hmm, that guy sure looks familiar... Oh, aren't those two the scholars from Sumeru who were bitten by the Koholasaurs?
Paimon: They also wanted to go to the mysterious island, right? Seems they've finally realized that they need a guide.
Koolau: A commission? Since you've obviously heard about my abilities, have you also happened to hear about my rates? If you're not intimidated by the price, then we can talk.
Viramdra: Yes, I've looked into everything I need to know. As long as the trip is a success, then the commission fees won't be a problem.
Koolau: Oh? And where is it you want to go?
Viramdra: The mysterious island.
Paimon: Just as Paimon thought...
Viramdra: But first, please don't misunderstand. I'm no tourist, I wish to visit the real place!
Seketo: You hear that? He wants to go to the island...
Suya: In that case, Koolau's the only one for the job. But the journey to the island requires a lot more than just a guide, right?
Koolau: Since you want to visit the real mysterious island, then I'm sure you've also heard about the requirement for our trip, right?
Viramdra: Yes, I know. According to the legend, only those who are willing to entrust their lives to one another will be able to reach the island together.
Viramdra: I must reach that island, even if that means putting my life in someone else's hands. I have made up my mind!
Koolau: Don't waste your words on me. Way I see it, the requirement is just a way to weed out those who do not have the skills to reach the island by themselves.
Viramdra: Y—You...
Koolau: You say you'd put your life in somebody else's hands? Ridiculous. Even if someone were to trust me with their life, they'd just be another burden.
Koolau: Let's look at it the other way around. Why would I place my life in the hands of someone whose abilities are far below mine? That is what the legend is really hinting at here.
Koolau: Many guides in the tribe have received commissions like this, only to end up bogged down by their incompetent clients long before reaching the destination.
Koolau: How do you think I reached the mysterious island? I made it because I chose to go alone.
Viramdra: Well, um... I'm different. I'm no ordinary tourist!
Koolau: That doesn't make much of a difference to me. You'll give up half way at best, which is a waste of my time, and a waste of your commission fees.
Koolau: I can tell you're just looking to explore something new. If that's the case, then you can find another guide in the tribe. For example...
Koolau: Nuu's student over there.
Paimon: What's up with that guy's attitude? Paimon takes back everything nice she said about him!
Koolau: I have things to do now. Goodbye.
Mualani: Hold on, Koolau!
Koolau: What's wrong? I'm only introducing a potential client to you because I know your teacher. In fact, I'd say it's quite the opportunity.
Mualani: Never mind that for now. I don't agree with your views on the island! Uncle Nuu taught me that—
Koolau: I know, you're just the same as him. You both obviously hope to prove yourselves, but still think that you have to follow the legend to the letter... waiting for a cumbersome client to find you before even trying to set off.
Paimon: Mualani...
Koolau: The rare ores I brought back are proof that I've been to the island. But as for Nuu? Where's his proof? Why don't you wait until he's actually found the island before you start using his views to refute me?
Black Screen Text: After Koolau leaves, the crowd begins to disperse.

## Talk 3

Mualani: Hey, Pakaa Pakaa!
Pakaa Nui: Mualani? Have you finally decided to release a record of your own?
Mualani: You'd be the first I'd sign with if I ever did, but not today... I just want to buy a record, the one you've been keeping from customers and listening to in secret.
Pakaa Nui: Huh? That's a pretty rare record, you know... Besides, I haven't even finished listening to that one yet.
Mualani: Maybe I can think of a way to connect you with a friend from the Masters of the Night-Wind to release a record...
Pakaa Nui: Whoa, then we could produce some really wild tunes! You've got a deal!
Mualani: Nice! That's the record also accounted for.
Paimon: What do we need it for, anyway?
Mualani: Well, I asked a friend from the Masters of the Night-Wind for some advice once, and apparently, playing this song at night is an effective way to keep travelers safe and sound.
Paimon: Is that really a thing? Well, if it doesn't cost much, that's a nice way to make the trip a little more pleasant...
Pakaa Nui: You know how it goes, Mualani. 20,000 Mora for this record — that's the best I can do.
Mualani: Deal.
Paimon: Looks like Mualani really is rich!
Mualani: That should be about everything we need to buy. Next is... Oh, I'm getting kinda nervous.
Paimon: What's wrong, Mualani?
Mualani: Next, I need to find my teacher, and get the map to the island.
Mualani: Besides the legend left by the first chief, there's also a map. Well, not just a regular map, it's more like a treasure map...
Mualani: It's full of strange symbols, almost like it's a part of a big puzzle. Guides must draw from their experience to decipher the map's meaning and understand the route.
Mualani: The chief made several copies of the map, and distributed them to the first members of the tribe. The copies were to be passed down to future generations, so usually a teacher will pass their copy to their student.
Mualani: Which brings us to today... the day I officially ask Uncle Nuu for his copy of the map.
Paimon: Whoa, hearing that is also making Paimon feel a little nervous! Sounds like it must be a pretty serious moment.
Mualani: Yes, but the thought of having you two by my side somehow makes me feel a lot better. We won't let Uncle Nuu down, right?
Paimon: That's right! Let's go and find him together, hehe!

## Talk 4

Mualani: Heya, Lafa! I've got some business for ya!
Yelafath: We've been over this before... the name's Yelafath.
Mualani: I know, it's just that "Lafa" sounds so much cuter!
Yelafath: Well, since you're the customer here, I guess whatever floats your boat...
Mualani: I need a camping tent with all the accessories... Only the best you've got!
Yelafath: Another commission, huh? Just so you know, a full tent according to your standards is gonna be pricey. Is your client covering the bill?
Paimon: How much are we talkin'?
Mualani: Don't worry about the costs, I'll take care of it.
Paimon: Oh, but, that's not right!
Traveler: We're the clients, after all.
Mualani: #Ahem! Let's make this clear, Traveler and Paimon. We're not working together like this is a hired commission, are we?
Paimon: Uh, no... we're traveling as close friends who trust each other with anything!
Mualani: That's what I thought! Honestly, I can be a little picky when it comes to camping equipment, and I don't want my friends to be paying for me. But don't worry, it's not that expensive.
Mualani: We're ready, Lafa!
Yelafath: Your total is 200,000 Mora.
Paimon: Isn't that still a lot for you, Mualani?
Mualani: Just imagine us in the wilderness, okay? We can either sleep out in the open, tired and weary, or simply spend a week's worth of pocket money and completely solve that problem. I'd say that's a great deal!
Paimon: You call that a week's worth of pocket money? Are you rich, Mualani?
Mualani: That's not important! We still need to buy some equipment from another store. Come with me!

## Talk 5

Mualani: Afternoon, Uncle An!
Anchieta: You call me "uncle," but I'm old enough to be your grandfather, you know.
Mualani: Because you're still young, Uncle An! Hey, can you help me find something kinda rare? I can negotiate the price, what do you say?
Anchieta: Alright, what're you looking for?
Mualani: A record player... specifically, the kind that's convenient to take camping.
Anchieta: Ah, that model is pretty rare, indeed. I thought it'd be nice to keep it as a prized collectible in the shop...
Mualani: Ahem, Uncle An?
Anchieta: *coughing* Just don't break it, okay? I'll even buy it back from ya when you're done with it!
Mualani: Thanks, Uncle An!
Paimon: A record player? Does that mean we need to buy some records, too?
Mualani: Yep! And that's our next stop!

## Talk 6

Paimon: After all we've been through recently, it sure feels good to come back to visit the People of the Springs!
Paimon: It's been a while since we last got in touch with Mualani. Wonder what she's up to now...
Traveler: Why don't we just ask her to be our guide?
Paimon: Have Mualani be our guide? Ah, Paimon just remembered something... Do you remember that journey to the mysterious island that we were never able to complete?
Traveler: The one with the legend?
Paimon: Yeah, that's the one! Paimon remembers the chief of the People of the Springs told us that we must find a guide we could trust with our lives... That would make Mualani the perfect choice, wouldn't it?
Paimon: We can invite her to be our guide and set off for the island. As qualified adventurers, we should never give up!
Traveler: You're thinking about the treasure, aren't you?
Paimon: Well, we should always keep the treasure in mind, shouldn't we? C'mon, let's go find Mualani!
Traveler: She can take us on a tour of Natlan.

## Talk 7

Mualani: Afternoon, Uncle Nuu! I have a big surprise for you!
Nuu: A surprise... Then you must be here to finally pick up the map.
Mualani: Ah, you saw right through me as always...
Nuu: Did you forget that you had mentioned these two to me before? The ones who went to the Night Kingdom with you... In some sense, you could say that you've already trusted each other with your lives.
Nuu: It's just that... my feelings are a little complicated now.
Paimon: Huh!?
Mualani: Do you think that I'm still not ready yet, Uncle Nuu?
Nuu: No, I believe you are the best guide in your generation. It's just that... I'm not ready yet.
Nuu: After all, the journey to the mysterious island is no easy feat for any guide of the People of the Springs. I'm still a little worried...
Paimon: Don't worry, with our help, Mualani will definitely be able to find the mysterious island!
Mualani: Yeah, this time, I'll definitely be able to prove that Koolau is no better than Uncle Nuu!
Nuu: Don't misunderstand. Since you've made up your minds, I won't try to stop you. It's just... please listen to your teacher's words once more, Mualani.
Nuu: Our mission as guides has never been to prove anything. There is only one thing we must do... guide tourists safely to their destination.
Mualani: ...I understand, Uncle Nuu.
Nuu: In that case, you may have the map. Also, take this with you.
Mualani: What is it?
Nuu: It's a talisman. Take good care of it. You must return it to me when you get back from the mysterious island.
Mualani: Was this made with Spinel Fruit? Hmm, for some reason, this doesn't look like a regular Spinel Fruit to me...
Nuu: Right, which is precisely why it's so effective.
Mualani: You really know me best, Uncle Nuu.
Mualani: #Alright. Traveler and Paimon, tomorrow we'll set off. Make sure you get some good rest tonight.
Paimon: Yay, Paimon can't wait for another adventure!

## Talk 8

Mualani: I'm really sorry, I just wanted to take you to see what the excitement was all about... I wasn't planning on getting into an argument with him again.
Paimon: That Koolau seemed to harbor some kind of grudge against you, Mualani. Or maybe your teacher?
Mualani: I know... Quite an impressive achievement for my teacher, huh? Even the best guide in the tribe can't stop talking about him.
Paimon: Paimon thought you would be more upset.
Mualani: Of course not! Uncle Nuu has also argued with Koolau before. I've already heard the same words several times now.
Mualani: But it's hard to prove anything to him unless you've actually been to the island.
Traveler: You also really hope to reach the island, right, Mualani?
Mualani: That's right. It's just that I've always seen the journey as something super important and not to be taken lightly. I was really surprised when you asked me to be your guide today.
Mualani: Ah! After telling you about all the dangers with such a serious face, I didn't make you think that you're causing me trouble, did I?
Paimon: Actually, Paimon did think about taking our invite back.
Mualani: No, please don't do that! Actually, that is also a part of what Uncle Nuu taught me as a guide. The difficulty of the trip is the very first thing that needs to be clearly laid out to the group.
Mualani: Ahem... "If you want a chance of reaching the destination together, you must first reach a consensus on the amount of effort that will be required."
Mualani: I always felt that my teacher is no less skilled than Koolau, but Uncle Nuu has never been to the island, so Koolau always uses that to push us down.
Mualani: So, as Uncle Nuu's student, I've always wanted to complete the trip to prove his skills. It's a pity that I've never had the chance...
Paimon: But don't you have that chance now, Mualani? If you'd agree to be our guide, we're completely willing to trust you with our lives!
Paimon: #With the help of the renowned Traveler and his trusty companion, you'll definitely be able to find the mysterious island. Then you can come back and teach that Koolau a lesson!
Mualani: Aw, Paimon... C'mon, bring it in!
Paimon: Aw, you're making Paimon blush...!
Mualani: Alrighty then, if we're gonna go, we should start preparing right away. I've already had the plans for this trip written out for some time. Come with me!
Viramdra: Ahem!
Paimon: Oh, it's that scholar guy. Paimon almost forgot he was still here...
Viramdra: Scholar guy? My name is Viramdra. Please use it!
Karya: #I didn't expect to see you again, Traveler and Paimon.
Paimon: Oh, and it's that lady, too! Hello again!
Karya: Excuse me... Miss Guide. Since we've been referred to you, would it be okay for us to join your journey?
Mualani: I'm Mualani. Just call me by my name.
Mualani: As for whether or not you can come along, I'm sure you've already heard the requirements. We've only just met, and I'm not sure you're cut out for this trip. The path to the mysterious island is a grueling one.
Karya: Oh...
Viramdra: I admit that after coming to Natlan, I've encountered many things outside of my field of expertise. It's understandable you're worried that we'll slow you down, so how about this?
Viramdra: We'll set off with you as ordinary travel companions, and I'll pay you the usual commission fees, but we won't officially be your clients.
Viramdra: In other words, you needn't shoulder the responsibility of being our guide. And even if something were to happen to us, your reputation as a guide won't be tarnished as a result. How does that sound?
Mualani: If you accompany us, then you are a member of the team. I could never agree to such a careless deal... Don't tell me you think I'm the same kind of person as Koolau?
Viramdra: So you still refuse... *sigh*
Viramdra: Fine. Karya, I'll put the Mora for the return trip in your backpack. Without a guide, the road ahead may be dangerous, so please don't follow me.
Karya: Viramdra...
Paimon: Now he wants to go alone? Why is this guy so obsessed with that island?
Mualani: Wait, please don't do this in front of a guide! I can't let a tourist go on some dangerous journey all alone. Even my sweet mom would give me a harsh scolding if I ever let you do that.
Karya: I'm so sorry for the trouble, really...
Mualani: Don't say that. Although it'd be inappropriate to bring along two strangers I just met, there is another solution.
Mualani: How about this... Let's meet up tomorrow morning at the monument near the tribe's southeastern slope. I'll see you there!
Viramdra: So you've decided to accept my offer?
Mualani: No, my plan is to use some of our time together to turn you from strangers into friends... the kind we can trust with our lives!
Viramdra: ...That's your plan? Very well then.
Karya: Wonderful! On behalf of both Viramdra and I, thank you so much!
Paimon: Pretty sure only Mualani could come up with a plan like that...
Traveler: Yep, that's Mualani for you!
Mualani: We need to get started on our preparations. Come with me!
