# Even Beasts Stumble


## Talk 1

Traveler: About the goods...

## Talk 2

Elber: Help! Somebody help me!
Paimon: Someone's in danger! We've got to go help!

## Talk 3

Paimon: This is one of the locations Mr. Elber marked for us.
Paimon: See the footprints by the puddle? Did the Sumpter Beast leave that?
Paimon: If it trod in the puddle, there would be water on the hooves.
Paimon: Heh, it's time to use Elemental Sight! Follow the water's trail and we'll find the beast.

## Talk 4

Paimon: The box has a lot of things inside, probably goods dropped by the fleeing Sumpter Beast.
Paimon: It shouldn't be too far ahead. Let's move.
Paimon: Oh, remember to bring the cargo back to Mr. Elber.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Whoa! This Sumpter Beast is huge. It must hurt so bad getting kicked by it.
Paimon: Feed it with the food Mr. Elber gave us.
Traveler: Nice and slow...
Traveler: Are these enough for it...?
Black Screen Text: The Sumpter Beast gulps down the food. It seems to be in a better mood now...
Paimon: It seems to be in a good mood.
Paimon: Let's bring it back.
Black Screen Text: You go back to Elber with the Sumpter Beast...
Elber: Whew... I thought I'd lost it.
Elber: Thank you, Traveler. I can't express my gratitude enough.
Elber: I must check its condition now. Hope it wasn't hurt...
Elber: Traveler, please help me find the other Sumpter Beast.

## Talk 6

Elber: Now both Sumpter Beasts are back... Thank you so much, Traveler.
Traveler: About the goods...

## Talk 7

Elber: Great! I can't thank you enough, Traveler!
Elber: I could have gone broke if I'd lost the goods and these two Sumpter Beasts.
Traveler: Don't mention it.
Elber: Oh, yes, your payment... Please wait a second.
Elber: Please take these. I can tell from your looks that you have been venturing around.
Elber: I happen to be in the business of those gears. You could use all these.
Elber: Whew... The Sumpter Beasts have been recovered and the goods are mostly intact. I should be off.
Elber: Thanks again, Traveler.
Traveler: About our payment...

## Talk 8

Elber: Besides this one, there was another Sumpter Beast that had wandered off.
Elber: Luckily, this one's looking good.
Elber: Traveler, please help me find the other one.

## Talk 9

Paimon: This one... looks a bit irritated...
Paimon: Whoa... Look at its hooves. So sturdy.
Paimon: People could get stunned by a mere kick.
Traveler: Paimon, you can feed it.
Paimon: No! You go! Hurry!
Traveler: Please enjoy your food...
Traveler: No offense to your hooves...
Black Screen Text: The Sumpter Beast slowly swallows the food. It seems less restive now...
Paimon: It seems less angry now.
Paimon: Let's bring it back. Careful, don't get kicked...
Black Screen Text: You go back to Elber with the Sumpter Beast...
Elber: You got my two Sumpter Beasts back! Thank you so much, Traveler!
Elber: I'll return to the city as soon as I get the goods in order.
Elber: *sigh* I'll make sure to hire some escorts next time...
