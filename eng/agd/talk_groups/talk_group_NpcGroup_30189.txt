Mamoru: I'm Mamoru, the Arataki Drumalong Festival Atmosphere Ambassador. How may I help?
Mamoru: You're asking what my job is?
Mamoru: Well, as the atmosphere ambassador, my job is mainly to create a lively atmosphere and give all attendants the feeling of "I'm so hyped I'm going out of my mind."
Mamoru: Do you feel that way?
Traveler: Not even slightly.
Mamoru: ...Hey, don't say that!
Mamoru: That was really disheartening, it's like being punched in the gut! If that's how you feel... my job's meaningless, isn't it?
Mamoru: You are the boss's friend. Please, show me some support for his sake. I'm begging you, say the line!
Traveler: What line?
Mamoru: You know, "I'm so hyped I'm going out of my mind."
Traveler: I'm so hyped I'm going out of my mind.
Mamoru: Great! Awesome!
Mamoru: This is the best recognition I could ask for!
Mamoru: Come on, people! More music, more dancing, let's keep this party going!
Traveler: I'm so... I'm so... I'm sorry, I just can't.
Mamoru: Ugh... fine. Well, I guess I should at least keep trying, seeing how everyone else in the gang is working hard trying to do their jobs, too...
Mamoru: You can punch me in the gut, but I won't give up! Just like the boss says!
Traveler: Nowhere near.
