Mr. Bohuan: Hmm? Do excuse me, I was quite lost in thought just then. Can I help?

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing?
Mr. Bohuan: I was moved by the sight of the crystal-clear water as it flows off into eternity, never to return. So I stopped here to let it enrich my mind as I recite a few lines of poetry.
Mr. Bohuan: Look, traveler. This crystal clear river bifurcates at Dihua Marsh, one stream flowing north to become the sweet spring from which Mondstadt's wineries draw their water, the other flowing south into the sea and into infinity...
Mr. Bohuan: A cry of joy wells up in me: Behold, 'tis nature's majesty!

## Talk

Traveler: I'll leave you to it...
Mr. Bohuan: I beseech the one who thinks of me, now you must act if together we should be.
Though this world shall endure for an eternity, time shall devour my present beauty...
Mr. Bohuan: I implore the young in life to partake, to abandon caution is no mistake!
Ne'er must ye thy dreams forsake; one only regrets chances they didn't take!
