# Helm of Warding

One of the six lost offerings scattered throughout The Chasm. It was found hidden in the living quarters of the miners. A slightly less discerning eye might have mistaken it for a miner's hat.
It is heavily scarred and pitted, making one wonder how many miners' lives it must have saved.
