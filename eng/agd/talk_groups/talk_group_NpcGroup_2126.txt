Xuanfan: Can you believe it? I caught Captain Beidou's eye!

## Talk

Traveler: Captain Beidou?
Xuanfan: That's right! It happened just as I was starting to think that I should leave the fleet due to my dismay at our lack of results...
Xuanfan: It was at that moment that the "Alcor" passed us by, and I saw Captain Beidou standing at the helm...
Xuanfan: ...And in that moment, our eyes met.
Xuanfan: I just happened to be on her left, and that courage of hers that subdued the seas themselves pierced my heart in one glance.
Traveler: Isn't that the side with the eyepatch?
Xuanfan: Yes, of course, but ah, details!
Xuanfan: She truly is great! With but a single look, she was able to save the spent soul of a sorrowful sailor...

Traveler: Congratulations.
Xuanfan: Thank you! And thank Captain Beidou for setting my sailor's soul afire once again!
