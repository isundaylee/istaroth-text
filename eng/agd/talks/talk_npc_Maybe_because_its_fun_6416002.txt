Traveler: Maybe because it's fun.
Ami: Is it really fun? What's so fun about cooking out in the open?
Ami: I don't get it.
Ami: And what if a bug falls into the pot? That's not fun at all...
Ami: That would be a pity, for the bug, also for the grown-ups who eat the food with the bug in it. It's not worth it at all.
