Traveler: What's this Pearl Galley you speak of?
Pinghai: Well, it's normal to not know.
Pinghai: The Pearl Galley is where the wealthy bigwigs of Liyue pass their time. It's no place for plebeians.
Pinghai: With the exception of honored guests, any ordinary person who goes onboard will just be there as an onlooker.
Pinghai: Well, I've said quite a bit, haven't I? If there's nothing else, don't waste any more of my time.
