# Joy Above the Clouds


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hey, we're here!
Sucrose: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, great timing! We got a lot of letters in the mailbox, and I just finished sorting them into four groups!
Paimon: Nice work!
Sucrose: Well, the real work hasn't even started yet... Which batch of letters should we read through first?

## Talk 2

Timaeus: Wait! *panting* ...Wait for me!
Sucrose: Oh, Timaeus! What brings you here?
Timaeus: I'm sorry, I really am... the time just got away from me, and I didn't get around to writing that letter. However! I'm happy to announce that I think I can be the "one who would never lie"!
Paimon: Huh!? This is kinda sudden!
Paimon: Not that we don't trust you, Timaeus, but um... Could you elaborate a little? After you catch your breath...?
Timaeus: Of course, of course... Phew.
Timaeus: Do you still remember the time I, uh, ahem, collaborated with a certain Miss Ying'er?
Traveler: Rings a bell.
Timaeus: Well basically, she helped me out a lot with my research into potion-making once, and we've stayed in touch through letters ever since...
Paimon: Wait, so Ying'er is the girl from Liyue that Sucrose mentioned earlier?
Paimon: We always assumed you were hard at work every time we saw you at the Crafting Bench... So you've just been writing letters to Ying'er the whole time!?
Timaeus: No! I mean, not ALL the time. I've done some work, too... And anyway, our correspondence covers a lot of serious topics! Like perfumes, potions, alchemy...
Timaeus: Anyway! A few months ago, I made a vow to the heavens that I will be true to myself and never utter an insincere word until the day that I've managed to win Miss Ying'er's heart!
Paimon: So... at Starsnatch Cliff, you were picking Cecilias as a gift for Ying'er?
Timaeus: That's right! The Cecilia flower is said to represent a once-wayward heart transformed by the power of love. I couldn't think of a better flower to give than that.
Timaeus: I know full well that Miss Ying'er is far more knowledgeable than I in both the ways of the world and the ways of our craft... But I thought I should make the effort for once, and put myself out there.
Timaeus: Ahem. Which brings me to the subject of the last few days, and the Windblume Festival... I thought it was time for me to invite Miss Ying'er to Mondstadt.
Timaeus: But yesterday, Albedo told me that Sucrose has been working hard to help another girl achieve her dream...
Collei: ...!
Timaeus: And when I went to take a look at our roster, I saw that she'd done my remaining work for me...
Timaeus: I feel... incredibly guilty.
Timaeus: I've been spending all of my time in my own fantasy world while everyone else has been bending over backwards to help other people. How could I ever hope to be worthy of Miss Ying'er's love if I'm so selfish?
Sucrose: Oh, Timaeus...
Timaeus: And that's why I've decided to join you!
Collei: But, then what about Ying'er...?
Sucrose: Yeah, haven't you been planning this for over a month now? You said you were gonna invite her to Mondstadt...
Timaeus: Yes... I did mention in my letters that I'd like her to visit. Which is why I just sent her another gift with my handpicked Windblumes, along with a handwritten letter.
Timaeus: I explained that a matter of great importance has presented itself to which I must devote my full attention for the time being. As soon as it's resolved, I'll make haste to Liyue to pick her up in person.
Timaeus: I made sure to package the gift and letter with the greatest care. All I can do now is hope that she'll understand...
Timaeus: ...Point being, please know that I sincerely want to support you in this endeavor! Plus, I think I'm an honest person... As far as I recall, I don't think I've told a single lie in my life...
Paimon: Well, you certainly convinced Paimon with that speech! Don't worry, Timaeus, we won't let your determination go to waste!
Sucrose: ...Thank you, Timaeus.
Timaeus: Ahh, thank you, everyone! I promise to do everything I can to help!
Collei: Okay, so it looks like we've found our "one who would never lie."
Paimon: Great! Let's keep it up, on to the other three!
Black Screen Text: After some discussion, the group decides on a final pick for each part of the prophecy. Everyone gathers in front of the Crafting Bench.
Paimon: Okay, Paimon will do the honors! *clears throat*
Paimon: We have with us here the flower, the guide, the legend... and Timaeus.
Klee: Huh? Why did you only say Timaeus's name? You should say my name, too!
Paimon: Alright, alright! We also have Klee.
Klee: That's me! Hehehe~
Mona: With Klee here, this all somehow feels like we're getting ready for a field trip...
Albedo: There's nothing wrong with a more relaxed atmosphere, is there?
Traveler: Albedo, have you figured out your answer?
Albedo: Of course. We will soon see if my hypothesis has any merit.
Collei: Actually... I'm still feeling a little nervous.
Timaeus: Me too...
Paimon: But weren't you all fired up just a moment ago?
Timaeus: Uh, yeah, you're right... Okay, let's do this!
Sucrose: Actually, I'm a little worried too... Deep breaths... deep breaths!
Collei: I know what you're feeling... Saying anything becomes so much harder when there are so many people watching...
Mona: Well, does anyone know the exact location of where we're headed? Or should I do a reading on my scryglass?
Collei: Hmm, according to the prophecy, once we've figured out the answer, we should test it at the Lantern of Utmost Joy... Wait, but where is this lantern?
Paimon: Oh, we know something about that!
Traveler: I've already found out where it is.
Sucrose: What!?
Collei: What!?
Black Screen Text: You make up a story about how you discovered the location by divining the wind...
Sucrose: Wow, that's amazing! You really know how to do everything under the sun...
Albedo: Then we'll let you lead the way.
Traveler: Follow me.
Paimon: This is it! We're off to find the sacred location of the Lantern of Utmost Joy!
Traveler: Remind me.

## Talk 3

Klee: Aww... I don't see any lanterns here.
Collei: Hmm, now that I think about it, the prophecy didn't say anything about what the Lantern of Utmost Joy actually looks like, right? Maybe we've overlooked something?
Sucrose: #{NICKNAME}, are you trying to figure out something else from the paper?
Traveler: Exactly.
Traveler: (Venti's note here says we should look up and seek the answer from the sky.)
Paimon: Paimon's reading too... Huh, it says to look up?
Paimon: But... But there's nothing above us! The wind didn't trick us, did it?
Traveler: ...
Traveler: (The slip also says: "Now, you should recite the incantation"...?)
Traveler: Paimon, take a look at this.
Paimon: "Place the squirrel on the back of the pointy-eared cat, and a pious puppy will open the doors to show you the way..." Huh, Paimon read the whole thing out loud, but nothing's happening...

## Talk 4

Paimon: How did this little island get up here in the sky? Did somebody make it?
Collei: Just to be safe, I've been jotting down our entire route here. This way, no one will get lost!
Paimon: Oh! Good thinking, Collei!
Paimon: Huh, who would've thought we'd find this kind of table here... Weird, it's almost as if someone was holding a tea party.
Timaeus: I never would've guessed that such a place could exist, right above Mondstadt too...
Klee: Wow, look at the pretty lantern on the table! There's even a chair for each side of the lantern, too!
Mona: There seems to be something on the back of this chair. Let me have a closer look...
Mona: "Take your seat, present your answers, and you shall reach enlightenment."
Mona: Well, as far as instructions go, I guess that's simple enough...
Collei: So we just need to do as it says, right?
Albedo: Wait a second.
Paimon: Huh? What is it, Albedo?
Albedo: We'd better make sure this place is safe before taking our seats. Everyone, please stay clear for a moment.
Black Screen Text: Everyone vigilantly watches as Albedo conducts a thorough investigation of the space...
Paimon: Well, all our questions and doubts aside, the scenery here is pretty amazing! It'd be impossible to feel stressed here.
Sucrose: How is everything, Albedo?
Albedo: Hmm, everything seems to be fine. I didn't find any traps or suspicious mechanisms.
Albedo: But, I also couldn't find any overt destructive devices...
Collei: Huh? What do you mean...?
Albedo: Well, it seems that wrong answers won't have any catastrophic consequences. Looks like we'll have to sit on these chairs and fulfill the prophecy.
Albedo: Everyone, I would like to suggest that we try some risky answers on our first attempt. Let's reserve our most confident answers for the second round.
Paimon: That sounds kind of smart... But why?
Timaeus: Ah, I get what he means! If we do as he says, then we may be able to figure out how the puzzle works.
Collei: I see! That makes a lot of sense.
Mona: ...
Paimon: Mona, is there something wrong? You're not looking too good.
Klee: Oh, are you hungry? I brought some snacks...
Mona: Thank you for offering, Klee, but that's not quite it!
Mona: While Albedo was checking just now, I gave my scryglass a spin, hoping to find some information...
Mona: But there's a strange aura to this place. It's almost as if someone has been staring at me as soon as we stepped foot in here.
Mona: But if nothing here has actually been physically tampered with, then... No... Could that person be...
Traveler: (Mona just shivered... Did she sense some kind of great power?)
Klee: What do you mean, Mona? Who could it be?
Mona: ...Ugh, never mind. It's not like I've got any proof.
Paimon: Ah! Don't leave us on the edge like this, Mona!
Klee: Hmm... I'll just do what Albedo said!
Albedo: Yes, let's test the hypothesis together, Klee.
Klee: Mhm! C'mon, join us, Mona!
Mona: Oh... Alright.
Sucrose: Okay... Then I'll answer the first question. If someone were to ask me to find "a flower that is not of this world"...
Collei: You can do it, Sucrose!
Sucrose: Umm...
Sucrose: Then I would fetch a Tetratanic Sweet Flower!
Collei: Alright, I'm up next... My part of the prophecy is to find "a guide who will never get lost."
Sucrose: (Collei... I hope you found your answer...)
Collei: *sigh*...
Collei: My answer is... that I will be that guide.
Collei: For a long time, I have been guided by others. It's taken me a while, but I've finally made it to where I am today.
Collei: Although I still haven't made a name for myself, and I'm still quite immature, I... I would still like to put my name forward, because I would like to become a guide that can help others.
Collei: I want to help others the same way Amber, Master Tighnari, Cyno, and everyone else helped me. Now it's my turn to pass on the gift that I've been given.
Timaeus: Alright, it's up to me to answer the third part. I—I'll submit myself as "one who would never lie."
Timaeus: Although I've never really had any other virtues or talents, I'm confident that I've always been an honest person.
Timaeus: I—I'd like to thank everyone, too, for giving me this opportunity to validate myself.
Mona: And last but not least, I will answer the final part of the prophecy.
Mona: There's no tale more befitting the title of "a legend that never ends" than our fates as human beings.
Paimon: Wait, the Lantern just lit up!
Paimon: Whoa, all four sides of the Lantern are glowing!
Collei: Huh? But...
Traveler: But all we did was submit a batch of test answers...
Albedo: Collei, could I ask you to stand up for a second?
Collei: Oh, a—alright...
Albedo: ...
Paimon: Huh!? What's going on?
Paimon: Why is it lighting up regardless of who's sitting in the chair? Didn't it say we have to answer all the questions correctly?
Albedo: It's pretty clear now, isn't it? We've just proven that there is no "right answer" for this prophecy.
Sucrose: No right answer? But how could that be...
Albedo: Although the instructions had come from an old and enigmatic prophecy, it is in fact nothing like the ancient mechanism that we had all imagined it to be. I believe the lantern only serves as a simple signal...
Scarlett: Ah, and to think, I never expected you to actually find this place...
Timaeus: What!? There's someone else here?
Scarlett: We meet again, Traveler.
Paimon: Hey... you're that outlander we met the other day at Good Hunter.
Scarlett: It's all thanks to you that I was able to find this place. Good thing that you were too preoccupied with the prophecy to notice someone tailing you from the shadows.
Albedo: Oh, is that so? Then why do I spy yet another person following in your shadow?
Scarlett: ...Wait, really!?
Rosaria: ...
Rosaria: There's no need for pleasantries. You should know I'm here for you.
Scarlett: Is it just because I'm a visitor from abroad?
Rosaria: I was there when you snuck your way into Marjorie's place.
Scarlett: Heh, so you had your eyes on me even then, huh? That was two whole weeks ago, you know.
Rosaria: It's hard not to notice you when I'm on duty every day.
Scarlett: Alright, in that case, I'll admit it. I was the person who slipped this prophecy into the storybook.
Collei: Huh? But why? Then... does that mean... this wasn't a real prophecy after all?
Scarlett: Don't worry. Even though you probably have plenty of reservations about me, you can be sure that the prophecy is genuine.
Scarlett: In fact, many of you here today may have heard the codename of the one who left the prophecy to me.
Scarlett: She hailed from an ancient assembly of powerful women, each of whom used a single letter to signify themselves.
Mona: Who would've guessed... It seems that power was indeed left behind by the old hag after all...
Scarlett: Ah, so you're B's student. It's an honor to meet you. I am Scarlett, the successor of J.
Sucrose: Wh—What are you talking about?
Scarlett: It's a long story, but I'm not quite sure that I'm the best person to tell it.
Scarlett: Since you've all spent so much time and energy trying to decipher this prophecy, you must also be very interested in the secret behind this lantern, no?
Scarlett: The lantern has already been lit. Now then... "Please allow me to disturb your happy peace."
Alice: ...Huh? Why did this little thing just light up? How strange...
Scarlett: Hello? On the other side of the lantern... can you hear me over there?
Klee: Mom?
Alice: Hmm? Oh, I hear many youthful voices...
Scarlett: Madam, I am Scarlett, the successor of J.
Alice: Oh, ahem! Since we've last gathered, J's successor has already become so reckless and bold. Unbelievable...
Mona: Wait wait wait, why are you talking just like the old hag!?
Alice: Old hag? Who would dare say that... Is that Mona?
Mona: Who are you! Who dares imitate my master!?
Alice: Ahem... Hmph, and what of imitation and mimicry? It has always been a fool's errand to mimic and learn from humanity...
Albedo: Aunt Alice. I'm here too.
Klee: Moooom! Why are you trying to talk like other people?
Alice: Hehehe... so I see everyone's here. Well then, my warmest greetings, everyone!
Mona: Miss Alice, why would you...
Alice: Well, it's been many years since this Lantern last lit up! You can't blame me for thinking that one of the old friends from my youth may have decided to catch up again...
Paimon: Huh, why's she sound so coy all of a sudden...
Alice: And if I recall correctly, we left this lantern in the care of the Anemo Archon, Barbatos... Hmm, you must be commended for uncovering an artifact entrusted to the God of Wind himself.
Alice: Tell me, are you sitting around my beloved tea party table?
Klee: It's a reeeeeeeally long table!
Alice: Oho, so you are... I suppose this means even the Anemo Archon has granted you entry to this place. Was all of this Scarlett's doing?
Paimon: Wait wait, Paimon's completely lost now... So what was this "assembly" you were talking about earlier?
Scarlett: Miss Alice, would it be alright to leave the explanation of that to you?
Alice: Hehe, well, you should be rewarded for making it all the way up here and activating the lantern. Now then, let me tell you a long and ancient story...
Paimon: Ah, so this is where the legendary mages held their meetings.
Alice: That's right! We often met here to chat and have tea.
Collei: Th—Then what about the part saying that if we light the lantern of utmost joy, we'd receive a supreme blessing?
Alice: Ah, about that... Ehehe, I never expected anyone other than J to actually read the full contents of that prophecy. It's a little embarrassing...
Alice: The truth is, that prophecy was actually just a letter that we sent to J as a group the day before her wedding.
Albedo: Hmm, so it was indeed written by all of you.
Alice: Hehe, I must thank you for resisting the urge to immediately reveal the truth to everybody, Albedo. Knowing you, you probably figured out everything the moment you laid eyes on the message.
Albedo: No, it took me a little longer than that.
Alice: "A flower that is not of this world"... "A guide who will never get lost"... "One who would never lie"... And "a legend that never ends." These four descriptions signify four individual mages.
Alice: When a member of the organization had to leave the group to spend the rest of her days with her beloved, the other mages would write down this prophecy and send it to her to invite her for a final get-together.
Alice: "A flower that is not of this world" signifies, of course, flowers that do not naturally exist in this world. This is the signature of R, full name Rhinedottir, also known as "Gold."
Alice: If there's anyone in this world who could create a flower species that does not yet exist, it would be her.
Alice: The "guide who will never get lost" is N, otherwise known as Nicole. You may have not encountered her yet, but she is a truly extraordinary woman who has made this world's direction and order her subject of study.
Alice: Some of you may be fortunate enough to have already heard her voice. Like a prophetess, she will only speak to guide people toward the truth when a change has occurred in the world.
Alice: She has a tendency to... suddenly speak in someone's mind without any warning.
Traveler: #(Huh! Could she have been the one who spoke to me while we were investigating {REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}...?)
Alice: If one day, you would be unfortunate enough to run into a truly dangerous situation, she may use her voice to guide the way forward for you.
Mona: Who would have guessed that there are so many mysterious women in this world, and that they would all know each other...
Alice: The "one who would never lie" is... me. I hope no one would take offense — it's just that I, Alice, or "A" for short, have always had a soft spot for those with sincerity and candor.
Alice: As for "a legend that never ends"... You may not know M in person, but you've likely encountered one of her works. Have any of you ever read "The Boar Princess"?
Sucrose: Huh? I'm pretty sure every child in Mondstadt has read that book.
Alice: Hehe, it's also one of my favorite stories. M was an exceptional human writer who used her prose to teach me the meaning of grief.
Alice: Don't you think such a person would deserve a seat at the mages' table?
Paimon: Paimon's getting more and more lost...
Scarlett: It may sound hard to believe, but I can attest to everything that Alice has said. J was also a mortal who aged and passed on, leaving her title to her students and followers.
Scarlett: Alice... You've never acknowledged any of J's successors. It's now been centuries since the first of us took on her mantle. I've always wanted to meet you.
Alice: Do you also want to become a mage?
Scarlett: Title aside, I think I'm more interested in the meaning and purpose of the Hexenzirkel.
Scarlett: I used to think that the Hexenzirkel was a group of women who could control the very fate of this world. But now... I've seen for myself that besides J, many other ordinary people were also among you.
Alice: Do you think less of us now?
Scarlett: No, not at all. My interest has been piqued, and I'm now even more drawn towards the idea of becoming a mage.
Alice: You're right, I've never acknowledged any of J's successors, but you are different. You are much more fascinating than any of your predecessors.
Albedo: Oh, has someone finally piqued Aunt Alice's interest?
Alice: Now is not a good time, Scarlett, but as soon as I am able, I will seek you out for a meeting. I want you to tell me all about J's married life back in her hometown.
Paimon: So, the mage who received the prophecy letter from all of you was J? She left the Hexenzirkel after getting married?
Alice: Precisely. There was only one way the letter could have been interpreted. She would have known what we meant as soon as she saw the message. We were just asking one thing of her...
Alice: "Please come to see us again. Before you go and settle forever with your happiness, please come share some of it with your best friends and sisters."
Collei: So, the "supreme blessing" actually meant...
Alice: All journeys are fleeting, and will eventually come to an end. What will give us the most fulfillment and happiness in the end are those who will greet us at our journey's destination.
Alice: Dear child, I believe you can also understand what I am talking about. We women will always have many troubles, and encounter pains and frustrations that will keep us up at night.
Alice: But no matter how hard things may become, we will cross mountains and oceans to see our best friends again... Regardless of how many years have passed, or how far the distance may be...
Alice: As long as we can be with our beloved friends, our hearts will be filled with joy. To us mages, that's what being "supremely blessed" is all about.
Collei: ...
Klee: Uh, I still don't really get it, but I do know that all the mages are Mom's best friends!
Alice: Hehehe... If you ask how I see it, the Hexenzirkel is just a group of ladies that I spent my youth with.
Alice: Anyway, I'll introduce some of the other members to you all later. I still have a few things to attend to, so this will have to do for today.
Klee: Bye, Mom! Dodoco says bye too!
Alice: Goodbye, darling! And farewell to all of our other friends as well. I'm sure we'll see each other again.
Alice: Ah, now that I think of it, isn't it getting close to... that time of year?
Mona: Yes, it's Windblume again, Alice.
Scarlett: It's also a special anniversary date. I'm sure you still remember...
Alice: Yes, I do remember now. It was on this day, many, many years ago, that J tied the knot.
Alice: Ah, just in time for the festival of love and freedom. Everyone, please enjoy this year's Windblume festival to the fullest.
Black Screen Text: Alice's voice fades, and the lantern grows dim. It is once again just a regular piece of decor.

## Talk 5

Timaeus: Ohh, ugh...
Sucrose: Are you okay, Timaeus? Maybe you'd feel better if you just... you know, let it out...
Timaeus: I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm just... a little glidersick, that's all.
Albedo: You may want to look into getting your own gliding license when you have the time. It might prove helpful to you.
Timaeus: Ah, okay... sure thing...
Collei: It sounds like you've still got something on your mind... Why don't you tell us, we're all happy to listen!
Timaeus: *sigh* It's nothing, really, it's just... Well, Alice's story WAS really interesting and romantic, I won't argue about that.
Timaeus: But still... the whole thing wasn't quite what I was hoping for.
Timaeus: Of course, I didn't actually expect the supreme blessing to be real, but... *sigh*
Sucrose: Ah, don't say that! None of this was your fault, Timaeus. Honestly, it's more on me for having agreed to be the Windblume Festival Special Ambassador. Had I not asked for everyone's help...
Collei: If anything, it should be my fault for finding that prophecy...
Timaeus: No no no, I didn't mean to blame the two of you either! I just feel like... this whole adventure didn't really end on a high note, and we also didn't really get anything out of it.
Collei: Hmm... But I'd say we still learned something new.
Sucrose: Well, that aside, Timaeus... You still need to go to Liyue to apologize to Ying'er, right? Do you want Collei and I to accompany you?
Timaeus: Oh, Miss Ying'er... Well... I mean, I just really don't want her to get mad at me! Now that I've come back to my senses, I really don't know what I should do...
Albedo: Hey, you three... You may want to look over there.
Timaeus: Hmm?
Timaeus: M—Miss Ying'er!?
Sucrose: Oh, so that's Miss Ying'er!? I've never met her before...
Paimon: Yep, that's her! And she actually came all the way to Mondstadt...
Timaeus: Ah, I'm so sorry, Miss Ying'er... But how did you... I mean...
Ying'er: Hehe, are you so happy just to see me?
Timaeus: I, uh... of course I am! I'm so happy that... I don't, uh... Sorry, I don't know what to say...
Ying'er: I was ready to give you a harsh scolding, but now that I've seen you like this, I suppose I could let you off the hook this time.
Ying'er: You said you couldn't come to pick me up because of a very important matter, right? Well then, of course I had to come and find you instead.
Paimon: Hehe... should we go see how they're doing?
Mona: I wouldn't. You'll get hit by a forest boar if you interrupt a couple's romantic conversation.
Paimon: Oh really? Uh, we'll just leave them alone then.
Traveler: (They look quite happy... Maybe that's what Windblume's all about.)
Black Screen Text: Their adventure has come to an end. Everyone bids farewell, and soon, only a few people are left standing by the crafting bench...
Sucrose: I am so glad to see Timaeus find his happiness...
Collei: I have to say, I'm even more envious of you, Sucrose...
Collei: You can be happy just to see others happy, and you gave me so much help without any expectations in return... Even though you said that we're very much alike, I still feel like you have a much bigger heart than I do.
Sucrose: But if you say that, then I'd say I'm also nowhere near as brave or tenacious as you. I guess we have the same amount of positive qualities... they're just spread over different parts of our personalities.
Sucrose: I've never visited Sumeru, or made many friends from outside of Mondstadt. I'm happy just to have met and become your friend.
Sucrose: Maybe I'll get shy and flustered when I meet other people I don't know in the future... But that's okay, too.
Sucrose: Since we are so alike, you probably get what I'm trying to say. You just need to believe that all of your "issues" aren't really issues at all!
Collei: But... Isn't it too late now for me to learn to accept myself?
Sucrose: Uh, well... Hmm, do you know anything about the blooming cycles of Cecilias?
Collei: Umm... I may have read about that in a book before.
Sucrose: That's a topic that my parents used to talk about back when they were still dating. Surprising, right? To think that people would talk about that while on a date.
Sucrose: My mom brought it up at dinner one time last month. She called my dad the most boring man she knew, and said that he even turned up late to a date once... all with a smile on her face.
Sucrose: But she also said that learning is just another part of life. It's never too late to start something as long as you recognize that it's something good for you to do.
Collei: ...
Sucrose: Why don't you give it a try, Collei?
Collei: ...Okay! I'll try my best.
Paimon: They're really having a great conversation... Paimon can't even find a moment to join in.
Traveler: Well, isn't it great that they're getting along so well?
Sucrose: Ah, I nearly forgot! This is for you.
Collei: This texture... Are these seeds?
Sucrose: Yep! I believe I mentioned my Sweet Flower research to you before. These are the seeds of the Sweet Flower cultivars that I have worked on.
Sucrose: It's nothing too special, but they're the best cultivars that I've made! So... I really hope that you'll like them...
Sucrose: They're super sweet, and easy to grow and keep!
Sucrose: I'm also submitting them as my Windblumes for this year. I wish that the Anemo Archon could also see how lovely they are...
Collei: Thank you! I'll plant them in the Avidya Forest, and take good care of them.
Albedo: Collei, please take these notes with you.
Albedo: I've heard that you've been working hard on your studies, so I've prepared some study materials for you at Sucrose's request. Feel free to look through them whenever you can find the time. Mondstadt's doors will always remain open to you.
Collei: Ah... Thank you so much... Really... I...
Collei: ...
Collei: I don't know what to say. I... I'm just really happy.
Paimon: Ah! Sucrose! Now's your chance! Didn't you want to collect a "Breath of Joy"?
Sucrose: Ahhh, you're right, I almost forgot! Collei, can you exhale once into this test tube? I will save this breath of joy, and use it in my research.
Collei: Oh, really? May I?
Sucrose: Of course!
Black Screen Text: Collei exhales into Sucrose's test tube, and the fluid turns a deep violet...
Sucrose: Huh...? What... what was that?
Collei: It was like a little cloud of happiness, but now it flew away...
Sucrose: Well, luckily there's still some breath left in the test tube... I'll seal it up for now.
Sucrose: I'll keep working on it and let you know as soon as I have any breakthroughs in my research!
Collei: Yeah, you can write to me! I'll be sure to respond as soon as I receive your letter.
Tighnari: Oh, it looks like you've found a new pen pal?
Collei: Master Tighnari! Cyno!
Cyno: If your friendship was forged in a test tube, does that make you "test friends forever"?
Tighnari: That's it... I think you've ruined Sumeru's reputation in Mondstadt beyond all hope of repair.
Cyno: All that matters is that I've enjoyed Mondstadt immensely. The dragon here possesses a majestic form.
Albedo: #Ah, that reminds me. {NICKNAME}, this card back is for you.
Traveler: Wait, for me?
Traveler: Didn't Cyno commission this?
Albedo: Cyno wanted you to have one for yourself. If I had to guess, I'd say he probably wants you to use it if you challenge him to a duel.
Cyno: I'm a master of the game. Do you dare challenge me?
Paimon: Can you believe this guy!? Let's knock him off his high horse!
Traveler: It's time to duel!
Collei: W—Wait, I've got something to give you, too...
Paimon: Huh, Collei has a gift for us?
Collei: Yeah. I... figured I should follow local Mondstadt customs, and prepared a few small things themed after the Windblume Festival.
Collei: I made these bookmarks from Sumeru Roses at the hotel... I want to give them to Amber, Master Tighnari, and Cyno.
Collei: During Windblume, Mondstadters offer flowers to the people most important to them... you three are family to me.
Cyno: But Tighnari said that we're not anything like an academic family. He wouldn't write joint papers with us...
Tighnari: Well, in this case, we can consider ourselves as regular siblings, and that should be just fine.
Collei: Hehe, I agree!
Collei: #Oh, and here are some Padisarah seeds as well... These are for {NICKNAME}, Paimon, and everyone else from Mondstadt.
Paimon: Whoa! Are these really for us?
Traveler: Thank you. We really appreciate it.
Traveler: Score!
Sucrose: So, are these your chosen Windblumes?
Collei: Mhm, one of them! Both Padisarahs and Sumeru Roses are my Windblumes.
Collei: Although they're not native to Mondstadt, they are the flowers that can best express my feelings.
Collei: I want to give them to the people I feel thankful for, to those who... I wish to accompany as we greet more seasons and future Windblumes together.
Collei: The real blessing in life is when you are surrounded by people who you'd miss day and night, and who you'd want to see even if that meant crossing mountains and oceans to do so.
Sucrose: Hehe! I'm so happy to hear you say that.
Collei: ...
Collei: Sucrose, do you see that cloud over there?
Sucrose: Hmm?
Collei: Doesn't it look... just like your test tube?

## Talk 6

Sucrose: Let me quickly summarize what we've found out about "a flower that is not of this world."
Sucrose: Tighnari believes that on closer examination, it might be logically paradoxical, while Albedo says that his answer would be better discussed at length in person...
Sucrose: As for my answer... I think a clock in the shape of a flower would constitute one "that is not of this world."
Collei: Here's what we've gathered regarding "a guide who will never get lost."
Collei: #Mona said that she'd like to join us in uncovering the secret behind the prophecy, while Bennett suggests Fischl, Mona, or {NICKNAME} as potential candidates.
Collei: Mika didn't submit much, but he did draw a vegetation map for Master Tighnari and wrote up a dragon-spotting calendar for Cyno...
Collei: Amber also wrote in... She said that she sees herself as nobody's guide, but everybody's friend.
Sucrose: As for "one who would never lie"... Rosaria removed herself from consideration, but both Razor and Cyno are willing to support us in our search.
Sucrose: Timaeus seems to have forgotten to write to us...
Collei: And finally, this is what we've gathered on "a legend that never ends." Klee said that her mom has a number of friends who like to write storybooks...
Collei: Lisa believes that legends live forever in people's hearts. I think that for a legend to be never-ending, it has to be filled with hopes and dreams, and actively passed from one person to the next.
Paimon: So... what're the answers to the four riddles then?
Collei: Uhh... you're really smart, Paimon! I bet you can figure it all out in no time!
Sucrose: Or... let's all share our thoughts on what we think the answers might be.

## Talk 8

Klee: Look, look! The wind is blowing!
Albedo: What a strong wind current... Let's ride it up and see where it leads us.
Timaeus: Huh? We'll have to fly up there? Uh, can someone carry me with them...?
Albedo: Here.
