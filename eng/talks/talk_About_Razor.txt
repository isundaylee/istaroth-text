Traveler: About Razor
Paimon: Have you heard of the brush?
Traveler: You mean pens made using animal hair...
Paimon: That's correct! They say that finely-made brushes sell for high prices among Liyue's merchants!
Traveler: So, would you like to make some too?
Paimon: Uh-huh! But the wild wolves are too fierce, so we should use Razor's fur to make brushes instead!
Paimon: Razor's fur is all downy and soft. It'll definitely make great wolf pens! We could make lots of Mora like this!
Traveler: Brushes made like that would conduct electricity.
Traveler: Besides, Razor isn't a wolf.
Paimon: Eh? Why are they called wolf pens, then?
Traveler: Well, does Cider Lake look like it's full of cider to you?
Paimon: Hmm. You have a point.
Traveler: Nor are wolf pens made from wolves' hair...
Traveler: I'm not sure we could use them...
Traveler: ...For writing purposes?
