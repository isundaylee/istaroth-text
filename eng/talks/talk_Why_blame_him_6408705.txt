Traveler: Why blame him?
Farghani: That's because he asked me to skip classes with him. Whenever there was a class he found boring, he would grab me and have coffee in the downtown area.
Farghani: But that guy did surprisingly well in all the foundation courses. I suspect that he dragged me out of classes on purpose, while he studied by himself at night.
Farghani: Ah, time passes so quickly. I didn't expect him to be a candidate for the next Grand Conservator now.
Farghani: I hope he gets elected so I can go around telling everyone that I skipped classes with the Grand Conservator back in the day.
