Jack: Help!

## Talk 2

Jack: Traveler, it's you! Thank you so much.
Jack: Can I ask you for a favor...?
Jack: This roadblock here is the only thing getting between me and my adventure...
Jack: Can you get rid of it for me?
Traveler: Sure.
Jack: *sigh* I wish I was more like you... I'd be a veteran Adventurer by now!
Traveler: I'd love to, but I have to get going.
Jack: Please, I'm begging you... I can't let this be where my adventure ends!

## Talk 3

Jack: Thank you so much, Traveler.
Jack: I was on my way to check out somewhere Stanley once went on an adventure. Had I known they would show up...
Jack: I'm just not strong enough... I know for a fact that Stanley would have had no problem dealing with a group like that.
Jack: Why don't you join me? Join me! ...Ugh, never mind, I can't have someone else doing even my adventuring for me...
Jack: I'm going to get moving. This is for you, I've gathered loads on the way to supplement my rations.
Jack: ...Even though they're not exactly rations.
