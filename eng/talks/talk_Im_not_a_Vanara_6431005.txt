Traveler: I'm not a Vanara...
Rudaba: Oh... What a shame.
Rudaba: Still, the opinion of others... can be used as a reference as well, right?
Rudaba: That said, I wonder how much you know about Avidya Forest...
Rudaba: ...Or how much of the traces the Dendro Archon left behind you've encountered.
Rudaba: ...Oh, forgive me for taking so much of your time. If you don't mind, you can have a chat with me when you're free.
