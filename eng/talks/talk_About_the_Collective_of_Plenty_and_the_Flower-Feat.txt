# Talk Dialog

Traveler: About the Collective of Plenty and the Flower-Feather Clan...
Paimon: Paimon's heard that everyone from the Collective of Plenty is built like a bricklayer!
Traveler: Does that mean you'll become Buffmon...
Paimon: No! Paimon likes herself the way she is now.
Traveler: Okay, then what about staying with the Flower-Feather Clan instead? They're adept fliers.
Paimon: Huh? But... isn't Paimon good enough at flying already?
Traveler: Yeah, but then you'd be able to carry me when you fly.
Paimon: Nope, not happening! How would that even be possible?
Traveler: Well, if you had those muscles I talked about...
Paimon: Oh, geez, not this again... For the last time, no!
Traveler: I'm sure they could help you sharpen your skills!
Traveler: ...if you were to stay there awhile, Paimon?
