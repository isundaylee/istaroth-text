# Chisato's Letter


## Talk 1

Kujou Kamaji: You are... Ahh, you're that Traveler from abroad. What can I do for you?
Traveler: About Hiiragi Chisato's Letter...
Kujou Kamaji: This letter... Did Ms. Hiiragi really ask you to deliver this letter to me?
Kujou Kamaji: This handwriting... It really is her... Thank goodness...
Kujou Kamaji: Thank you for making this trip, Traveler.
Kujou Kamaji: As for the Travel Permit... As it's Ms. Hiiragi's personal request, I will naturally see it through.
Kujou Kamaji: However, I'll need some time to prepare...
Kujou Kamaji: How about this. Can you wait for me at the Kiminami Restaurant?
Traveler: Why do you want to go there?
Kujou Kamaji: Well... I want a small favor from you.
Kujou Kamaji: Recently... I was also thinking of sending something to Ms. Hiiragi.
Kujou Kamaji: I wrote a letter and also requested Ms. Kiminami to make some treats for me. I was planning to send them together to Ms. Hiiragi as a present.
Kujou Kamaji: But if my father finds out about my plans, he might be upset... Just as I was pondering what to do, you showed up.
Traveler: It's only a present.
Kujou Kamaji: Father doesn't want me to communicate with Ms. Hiiragi.
Kujou Kamaji: I understand his concerns. After all, I am a member of the Kujou Clan and one of the enforcers of the Tenryou Commission.
Kujou Kamaji: Ms. Hiiragi is the young lady of the Kanjou Commission's Hiiragi Clan.
Kujou Kamaji: If I were to get too close to her, it would be inevitable that someone might try to take advantage of our situation.
Kujou Kamaji: Even though it is only a present, in some people's eyes, it's a lot more than that.
Kujou Kamaji: Hehe, let's not talk about these trivial matters.
Kujou Kamaji: Traveler, please wait at the Kiminami Restaurant for me. After I approve the Travel Permit, I'll bring it to you.
Traveler: Is your father very strict?
Kujou Kamaji: Father... He naturally has to be strict. I do understand why he's unwilling for me to communicate with Ms. Hiiragi.
Kujou Kamaji: After all, I am a member of the Kujou Clan and one of the enforcers of the Tenryou Commission.
Kujou Kamaji: Ms. Hiiragi is the young lady of the Kanjou Commission's Hiiragi Clan.
Kujou Kamaji: If I were to get too close to her, it would be inevitable that someone might try to take advantage of our situation.
Kujou Kamaji: Even though it is only a present, in some people's eyes, it's a lot more than that.

## Talk 2

Sanada: *sigh* What a headache... Hi there, is there anything you want?
Traveler: About Kamaji...
Sanada: Are you talking about Master Kamaji? What do you want from him?
Traveler: (Shows Chisato's Letter)
Sanada: You said this letter is from Ms. Hiiragi Chisato?
Sanada: If this letter is really from that Hiiragi Chisato...
Sanada: I think... You should talk to Master Kamaji directly. He's been taking walks near the bridge recently.

## Talk 4

Kiminami Anna: Welcome to Kiminami Restaurant.
Traveler: About Kamaji's treats...
Kiminami Anna: Oh, I've already prepared the treats that Master Kamaji ordered. I'll bring them to you now.
Kiminami Anna: But, I'm curious about who Master Kamaji will give these treats to...
Kujou Kamaji: It's nothing more than a public relations gesture, Ms. Kiminami.
Kujou Kamaji: A while back, Mr. Hiiragi Shinsuke presented my father with a batch of fine tea.
Kujou Kamaji: My father knows that Mr. Hiiragi's beloved daughter Chisato likes treats, so he told me to prepare some as a gift in return.
Kujou Kamaji: I was worried that the delivery might take too long, and there might also be unavoidable bumps during the journey... So I specifically asked for this Traveler to deliver them.
Kujou Kamaji: Ms. Kiminami, can I have a look at the treats, please? I want to make sure I haven't missed anything.
Kiminami Anna: Hmm... Sure, here are the treats. Please take a look.
Kujou Kamaji: Everything is there. Thank you, Ms. Kiminami.
Kujou Kamaji: Let us move out of the way, Traveler. I have a few more things to say to you.
Kujou Kamaji: This is the Travel Permit. Please take it.
Kujou Kamaji: With this Travel Permit, you can freely enter and leave Ritou.
Traveler: Thank you.
Kujou Kamaji: It's fine. This permit will make your delivery a lot smoother.
Kujou Kamaji: Also... Here's the letter.
Traveler: Did you write this letter yourself?
Kujou Kamaji: Yes. I tried to write this letter in a... tactful manner. I hope Ms. Hiiragi won't be offended by it.
Kujou Kamaji: Please deliver this letter and the treats to Ms. Hiiragi.
Traveler: Do we have to go back again...
Kujou Kamaji: Hehe, but this time, you have the Travel Permit. You should have a lot more freedom than before.
Kujou Kamaji: I'll leave it to you, Traveler. I also need to go back and deal with official matters.
Kujou Kamaji: Ugh, when will I be able to go there myself...

## Talk 5

Hiiragi Chisato: Traveler, you've returned.
Hiiragi Chisato: I guess you've delivered my letter to Kamaji? ...Did you manage to get the Travel Permit as well?
Traveler: Yes, I have. Thank you.
Hiiragi Chisato: You don't have to thank me. You should be thanking Kamaji instead.
Hiiragi Chisato: Eh? What's this? Treats, and... a handwritten letter from Kamaji?
Hiiragi Chisato: Was it his request? These Tricolor Dango... He prepared them for me...
Hiiragi Chisato: Thank you, Traveler. I'll make sure to savor these treats. As for this letter... I'll read it with great care.
Hiiragi Chisato: Thank you for the hard work. Please, accept these items as thanks for your help.
Hiiragi Chisato: Who knows... I might need your help again in the future as well.
Traveler: This is from Kamaji.
