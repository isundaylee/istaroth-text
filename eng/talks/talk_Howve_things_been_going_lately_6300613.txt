Traveler: How've things been going lately?
Ogura Mio: Things are going well. Thank you for asking.
Ogura Mio: With the trade routes re-opened, many customers have recently come to order silks. I have several pages' worth of names, in fact.
Ogura Mio: If you're looking to buy any now, I'm afraid that you might have to wait a few months.
Ogura Mio: *sigh* It's at times like these that I wish that my brother, stationed afar as he is, could return to help out...
Ogura Mio: Ah, why am I saying these things to a customer? I'm sorry.
Ogura Mio: If you ever run into my brother, please send him my regards. Thank you.
