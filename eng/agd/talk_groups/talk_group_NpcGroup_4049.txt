Sahar: Hi there, are you a traveler here to shop at the Grand Bazaar? I suggest you go to Jut's shop.

## Talk

Traveler: Why's that?
Sahar: In Sumeru, spices are a must-buy, and Jut's is the best spice store you can find around.
Sahar: Not only is the quality high, but the prices are very reasonable. He even sells the rare Padisarah!
Sahar: He also gives customers small gifts on occasion, so you definitely don't want to miss his store when you come to the Grand Bazaar.

## Talk

Traveler: Thanks for the recommendation.
Sahar: You're welcome. I'm sure you'll love it there.
