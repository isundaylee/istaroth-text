Traveler: What's got you so worried?
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: As a civil officer of the Shogunate, what else could I be worried about?
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: I've already requested the Tri-Commission to handle the matter. Although I am the head of the civil office, I don't have any actual power. All I can do is worry all day.
