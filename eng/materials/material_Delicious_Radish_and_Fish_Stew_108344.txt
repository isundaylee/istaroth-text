# Delicious Radish and Fish Stew

A meat and vegetable dish. Migratory fish have experienced many trials of the bitter cold, towering waves, and tumultuous storms en route to arriving upon the stove, and together with the radish, they have absorbed the essence of the flavorful soup long before they were ladled onto your plate. This sweetness warms the heart and soul, like a fire in the midst of a blistering world of snow.
