Traveler: Can I drink Fonta here?
Heinry: Of course! Check out this Motorized Autonomous Fonta Vending Machine. If you're a member of the Fontaine Research Institute, you can buy a refreshing original flavor Fonta from it with your Mora.
Heinry: However, if you're not a member of the institute, you won't be able to use this machine.
