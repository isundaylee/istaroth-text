## Talk

Bresson: You're back. Is there something you'd like to ask me?
Traveler: Who are you, again?
Bresson: Me? I am a member of the Fontaine Adventurers' Guild, and I am also a card-carrying member of the Kamera Club.
Bresson: However, the people of the Club always say that the quality of the photo depends on the skill of the one taking it.
Bresson: I've heard that some people even intentionally use outdated Kameras to take photos in order to hone their skills... That just seems like looking for trouble to me.
Bresson: I, on the other hand, believe that better equipment takes better photos.
Bresson: And they say I don't understand artistry... Hmph. Well, I for my part say they don't understand photography!
Bresson: But they'll understand someday — you mark my words! Engineering is the key! Engineering!
Traveler: Why won't you go diving?
Bresson: Well... You know how some people don't like to eat mushrooms, and how others might throw up when eating fish? That's just the thing — everyone's body is different.
Bresson: I can't take the dark environment underwater — why, I grow breathless if I remain in there for too long.
Bresson: Sometimes I feel my limbs tingle, my head spin, and then... Before I realized it, the Kamera would've slipped from my hand...
Bresson: I have been loath to go underwater ever since losing my fifth Kamera this way...
Traveler: See you.
Bresson: Then I'll leave the photo-taking to you. In the meantime, I'll be on the shore.
