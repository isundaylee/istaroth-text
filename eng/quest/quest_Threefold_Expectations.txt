# Threefold Expectations


## Talk 1

Paimon: We're back, Uncle Luo!
Uncle Luo: Ohh, thank you! The tea cauldron technician has already arrived and is tinkering with it over there.
Uncle Luo: *sigh* I wonder what's gone wrong with it...
Paimon: Err... So what's she doing?
Uncle Luo: Eh, I don't understand the technician's jargon either. Structural analysis this, bond graph that... Anyway, she's examining the tea cauldron.
Paimon: Ah, over there...
Uncle Luo: ...
Traveler: ...
Black Screen Text: Before long, Hautemontagne finishes the examination...
Hautemontagne: Mr. Luo! I've finished examining the tea cauldron. From the look of it...
Hautemontagne: Eh? You two are back!?
Traveler: I was worried about the tea cauldron.
Hautemontagne: Haha, no need to worry. There's no such thing as a problem that can't be solved, after all!
Uncle Luo: So, how's it looking? What's wrong with the tea cauldron?
Hautemontagne: It's not so much the tea cauldron itself, as... Well, take a look at the bond graph I've sketched out over here.
Hautemontagne: The flow source itself should be fine, but something's off with the performance of several gyrators over here...
Paimon: Flow... What now? Paimon's totally perplexed!
Hautemontagne: Ahaha... Apologies! I'm just so used to using all these technical terms...
Hautemontagne: In layman's terms, the tea cauldron itself is probably fine, but there's something wrong with three of the connected mechanisms. This is causing the flow of elemental energy nearby to act a little funny.
Uncle Luo: Hmph, I knew it! Grandpa Lu insisted the problem wasn't with the tea cauldron, but the soil...
Uncle Luo: Three mechanisms... Oh, right! You say "mechanisms," we say "monoliths"! Mountain Ley Lines wind all over the place, so you have to control them with sacred stones to prevent chaotic elemental energy...
Traveler: Oh, I see!
Hautemontagne: Hmm... Chaotic elemental energy is indeed a terrifying thing, but these mechanisms... shouldn't have much to do with the Ley Lines. They aren't directly connected.
Hautemontagne: While we can't clearly see how the mechanisms are structured, their operating principles are the same! Those legendary adepti must have been phenomenal artisans!
Uncle Luo: Hehe, you're not wrong there! I may not understand the mechanical mysteries at work here... But that Cloud Retainer sure is an incredible adeptus for having come up with such ingenuity!
Hautemontagne: These "monoliths"... Functionally speaking, a more accurate name would be "Three-Phase Asynchronous Elemental Tuners."
Paimon: Eh? Tuners?
Hautemontagne: That's right! According to the records, the great master Alain Guillotin himself — founder of the Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering — also designed a constrained layer dampener to regulate the elemental energy.
Hautemontagne: While his blueprints are long lost, the principle should be the same... Emphasis on "should" be!
Uncle Luo: Haha... Shame I'm too old to learn such things. So, let me ask again, what caused this problem? Is it serious, and can it be fixed?
Hautemontagne: Us technicians don't get too concerned with whether a problem is serious or not! We only think about whether or not it can be fixed. As for this particular issue... Let's just say if it wasn't fixable, I'd have left a long time ago!
Uncle Luo: Haha, well that's a relief! There I was, thinking the adepti saw us as a bunch of neglectful fools, and had cast some kind of magic on this ward to make it irreparable!
Hautemontagne: Mr. Luo, all devices are fundamentally the same! If they're left for too long without being maintained or repaired, it's only natural that problems will arise!
Hautemontagne: As Master Guillotin once said — no matter what the system, or how ingenious the original design, all mechanisms will eventually collapse if left to run completely on their own!
Hautemontagne: If there's actually something wrong with the tea cauldron, it would be totally unreasonable to blame the soil for not producing quality tea leaves without addressing the root of the problem!
Paimon: (Hmm, Fujin did mention earlier that the reason why the tea doesn't taste so great is because of the soil and water. If that "tuner" could be fixed, then maybe the water and soil will improve too...)
Hautemontagne: Anyway, the three mechanisms connected to the tea cauldron aren't too far from here, so let me go tinker about a bit, and I should be able to fix them!
Traveler: We'll come help too.
Hautemontagne: Thanks, that's very kind of you! In that case, there's no point waiting around — let's get going!
Uncle Luo: #Haha... Excellent! Mr. Traveler, Paimon, I'll leave this tea cauldron business to your good selves and the technician!
Traveler: Don't get worked up, Uncle Luo...
Hautemontagne: Mr. Luo is basically right. These mechanisms were specially designed to prevent chaotic elemental energy, but they have nothing to do with Ley Lines...
Traveler: I was worried about the tea.
Traveler: So that's real qinggong in action, eh...
Paimon: Err, pretty sure that's not what that is...

## Talk 2

Hautemontagne: Mmhmm, seems like there's nothing wrong with the elemental reaction here. Why don't we try...

## Talk 3

Uncle Luo: From what that technician lass said, it seems like there's a problem with the monoliths in the mountains...
Uncle Luo: *sigh* But I don't know exactly how serious the problem is. I just hope it can be fixed quickly...

## Talk 4

Paimon: We're back, Uncle Luo!
Uncle Luo: Ohh, thank you! The tea cauldron technician has already arrived and is tinkering with it over there.
Traveler: Speaking of which, has the tea problem been solved?
Uncle Luo: It has indeed! If only the tea cauldron could be fixed too, we might be able to turn this place into a tourist hotspot...
Uncle Luo: You know, this tea cauldron is said to be a divine treasure that was given to Qiaoying Village by that Cloud Retainer from Jueyun Karst... *sigh* I wonder what's gone wrong with it...
Paimon: Err... So what's she doing?
Uncle Luo: Eh, I don't understand the technician's jargon either. Structural analysis this, bond graph that... Anyway, she's examining the tea cauldron.

Hautemontagne: As Master Guillotin once said — no matter what the system, or how ingenious the original design, all mechanisms will eventually collapse if left to run completely on their own!
Paimon: Eh, that went right over Paimon's head... But anyway, if we can just fix those "tuners," that should solve the problem, right?
Hautemontagne: Yep, that's right! The three mechanisms connected to the tea cauldron aren't too far from here, so if you let me go take a look, I should be able to fix them!
Traveler: We'll come help too.
Hautemontagne: Thanks, that's very kind of you! In that case, there's no point waiting around — let's get going!
Uncle Luo: #Haha... Excellent! Mr. Traveler, Paimon, I'll leave this tea cauldron business to your good selves and the technician!

Paimon: Err, pretty sure that's not what that is...

## Talk 5

Paimon: Uncle Luo! With Mountain's help, all three mechanisms have now been taken care of!
Uncle Luo: Haha, I knew you three could do it! Such extraordinary skill!
Hautemontagne: #It was all thanks to Traveler and Paimon! I just need to do some final checks now, though there shouldn't be any problems... You two wouldn't be able to help out again, would you?
Paimon: Alright, let's head up together!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): You follow Hautemontagne to the tea cauldron...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): After tapping the tea cauldron lightly, a slight look of surprise appears on Hautemontagne's face...
Paimon: Eh, what's up?
Hautemontagne: Hmm, there's just something strange about the echo. According to my calculations, it should be more of a "thump—thump—thump" sound...
Traveler: Could you have miscalculated, maybe?
Paimon: Surely that's way too abstract, anyway! What do you mean by "thump—thump—thump"!?
Hautemontagne: Well... The tea cauldron's empty, so going by the formula left by Master Guillotin, the echo should be much clearer! What in Teyvat could be the reason...?
Paimon: Huh? What exactly is the problem? Can't see anything from the outside...
Traveler: Let me see...
Paimon: Hmm?
Traveler: *taps the tea cauldron* Like this...
Paimon: Um... No response?
Traveler: *taps the tea cauldron* Or like this...
Paimon: Still no respo... Wahhhh!
Traveler: Why don't you take a look inside, Paimon?
Paimon: Paimon can't fit in there! No way, surely!?
Paimon: Paimon feels like we've discussed this before, but... Why do you always try to get Paimon to go into such strange places!?
Traveler: Forget it! I'll check it out myself...
Paimon: Hmm?
Traveler: *taps the tea cauldron* Like this...
Paimon: Um... No response?
Traveler: *taps the tea cauldron* Or like this...
Paimon: Still no respo... Wahhhh!

## Talk 6

Traveler: Why don't you take a look inside, Paimon?
Paimon: Paimon can't fit in there! No way, surely!?
Paimon: And why do you need Paimon to go in, anyway? Can't you just climb up, lift the lid, and take a look inside yourself!?
Traveler: Forget it! I'll check it out myself...
Paimon: Hmm?
Traveler: *taps the tea cauldron* Like this...
Paimon: Um... No response?
Traveler: *taps the tea cauldron* Or like this...
Paimon: Still no respo... Wahhhh!

### Additional Talk 1

Uncle Luo: Whoa, how did you come out from there? I was just about to call someone — I was worried sick! Never imagined an adepti treasure could suck people in like that...
Uncle Luo: But check this out!
Paimon: Whoa! There's tea flowing out after cleaning out the elemental sedimentation... Hang on, this looks like it's just regular water!
Hautemontagne: Wow... Liyue's adepti mechanisms are truly incredible. They can even generate whole new spaces! Even Master Guillotin himself couldn't do such a thing...
Hautemontagne: Seems like Little Mao was right, after all! "There'll always be someone better than you, and teapots you haven't been to"...
Paimon: That's not how it goes!
Uncle Luo: Needless to say, without you the tea cauldron wouldn't have been repaired so quickly. Thanks for your help, Haut... mon... uh...?
Hautemontagne: Hautemontagne! But you don't have to use my full name. Just call me Mountain — it basically means the same thing anyway!
Uncle Luo: Haha! Alright, well thank you, Mountain.
Uncle Luo: This'll sort out the soil issue too... Hmph, guess you lost the bet, Grandpa Lu!
Uncle Luo: Can't let you young'uns toil away and go hungry for nothing... Once the current tea crisis has been resolved, we'll all finally be able to breathe a little easier, and no longer have to worry about losses...
Uncle Luo: Grandpa Lu, Laoding, and Xiaoding hadn't slept a wink for several nights, worrying about the substandard tea. But now the tea cauldron's been repaired... Just you wait and see! I hope I'm right, anyway!
Uncle Luo: Thank you all, dear guests, for your help as well. Qiaoying Village's future is looking bright once again!
Paimon: Hehe, you're too kind! As long as there's plenty of tea and snacks waiting for us the next time we come!
Uncle Luo: But of course, that goes without saying! You're Qiaoying Village VIPs now. Once the first batch is done, I'll reserve some of the very highest quality tea for you to sample!

Uncle Luo: Haha! Alright, well thank you, Mountain.
Uncle Luo: Roasting tea will never be as efficient as processing it in a workshop, but seeing as this tea cauldron was a divine treasure, it'll surely be a real tourist magnet and help revitalize Qiaoying Village!
Uncle Luo: Haha, we'll invite the tourists to experience our centuries-old tea making traditions themselves... And pocket a few Mora for entry tickets in exchange...
Paimon: Hmph, seems like someone's forgotten to respect the adepti...
Uncle Luo: Aha! The village will prosper, business will boom, and the adepti will smile upon us when they see it! Isn't that a kind of respect!?
Uncle Luo: Thank you all, dear guests, for your help as well. Qiaoying Village's future is looking bright once again!
Paimon: Hehe, you're too kind! As long as there's plenty of tea and snacks waiting for us the next time we come!
