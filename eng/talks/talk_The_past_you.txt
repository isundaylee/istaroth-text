Traveler: The "past" you?
Jiangzhou: *sigh* Did you ever spend Lantern Rite here in Liyue? I was the previous planner of the event.
Jiangzhou: Of course, Lantern Rite is the biggest festival of the year; everyone in Liyue Harbor comes out to celebrate it together. One planner can't handle an event of that magnitude...
Jiangzhou: But Liyue Harbor's high population and complex environment means that there are still very many issues for each planner to consider...
Jiangzhou: Like the lack of guardrails at the wharf, the crowding at food stalls in Chihu Rock, the cats and dogs and running around all over the place... There's so much to consider!
Jiangzhou: ...No, no, I'm starting to think like a planner again. That's not my job anymore â€” I should just get off work and go take care of my father.
