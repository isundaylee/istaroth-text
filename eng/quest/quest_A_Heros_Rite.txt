# A Hero's Rite


## Talk 1

Trinidad: Huni! What were you thinking, going out by yourself? Don't you know how dangerous it is?
Huni: It's okay, Toba helped me, and... we met some kind strangers who helped us, and—
Trinidad: "Kind strangers"? What made you so sure they were so kind, hmm? I suppose they had "kind stranger" written on their foreheads?
Huni: Y—Yeah, actually, they did! In big bold letters!
Trinidad: Don't talk back to me! The Mountain King problem still hasn't been solved... What would I do if I lost you too? No dinner for you tonight!
Huni: They were good people, dad! Dinner or no dinner...
Paimon: Hello again, Huni!
Huni: #Ah, it's Miss Paimon and Mr. Traveler! Dad, it's them! They're the ones who helped me... and I promised we'd take care of them if they came to visit...
Trinidad: Oh? So you're the "kind strangers," well...
Trinidad: I'm Trinidad. Apparently, you helped my daughter today, so if there's anything you need, just ask. As an elder of the Scions of the Canopy, I've got some influence around here.
Trinidad: Now, I trust that you're sensible people, who know better than to take advantage of their host's generosity.
Traveler: We just happened to be passing by, so we lent her a hand. It was nothing.
Paimon: Yep! Just helping a neighbor. We're not looking for anything in return.
Trinidad: Oh? Well, let's hope so...
Huni: Dad, please! They're not bad people! They've eaten at the same table with Kinich before. Be nice to them...
Trinidad: Kinich? Wait...
Trinidad: I heard that two mysterious travelers from afar showed up at the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. Are they... you?
Traveler: Yes, I'm one of them.
Paimon: And Paimon's the other!
Trinidad: Ah... Ahem...
Trinidad: ...I do apologize. A lot's been going on in our tribe lately, and I suppose the pressure must be getting to me, hehe... I can't believe I was so rude to you, I feel ashamed... *sigh* We got off on the wrong foot. Can we... start over?
Paimon: Hehe, now we're talking! Seriously though, don't worry about it — already forgotten. We're just happy to see Huni got home safe and sound.
Trinidad: You've just arrived, I take it? It would be my honor to give you a hero's welcome tonight.
Paimon: Careful now, that's quite an about-face... We've heard that kind of thing can lead to spontaneous combustion around these parts.
Trinidad: *cough*
Traveler: Save the VIP treatment. If you need a favor, let's talk.
Trinidad: Hah... My dear Traveler, you are very perceptive indeed!
Trinidad: Go inside now, Huni. Dad's got some important business to discuss.
Huni: #Okay. Look after Mr. Traveler and Miss Paimon, they're very special guests!
Paimon: Well, we'll hear you out, but we can't make any promises that we'll be able to help.
Trinidad: Ahem... This is a matter of utmost importance. Please, allow me to explain...
Trinidad: For many years, our tribe has celebrated the Turnfire Night. It is a traditional ceremony among the Scions of the Canopy, in which we remember our ancestor, Burkina, and his companion, Kongamato the Mountain King.
Trinidad: Burkina was a hero who bore the ancient name Mal{RUBY#[D]Turnfire}ipo, and Kongamato was a powerful yumkasaur warrior. Together, they fought against the Abyss.
Trinidad: They were victorious, but it came at a great cost... Burkina paid with his life. The Mountain King survived, but was contaminated by the Abyss, and he remains in hibernation to this day.
Trinidad: Normally, yumkasaurs never live longer than a century. It's possible that the Abyssal power is responsible for his unnaturally long lifespan.
Traveler: Wait, so he's still alive?
Trinidad: That's right. The Mountain King is a living symbol of our glory, but even this glory comes at a price.
Trinidad: The Abyssal power inside him is highly sensitive, and when it is disturbed, he awakens and flies into a blind rage, attacking anything that moves...
Trinidad: So, besides the ceremony, another important part of Turnfire Night each year is cleansing the Abyssal power inside the Mountain King, so that he will remain sound asleep.
Trinidad: However, Abyss-related incidents have been on the rise in Natlan lately, as I'm sure you're both aware. As a result, it has become increasingly difficult to keep the Mountain King in hibernation.
Trinidad: Only five months have passed since the last Turnfire Night, and he's already showing signs of instability.
Paimon: Has he woken up again?
Trinidad: He has. We managed to contain the situation by performing a makeshift ceremony right away, but it was a close call. He could reawaken at any moment.
Trinidad: Also, he attacked and wounded my companion, Nanna, during the ceremony... She became contaminated by the Abyss as a result, and...
Paimon: We heard... Such a tragedy. We're really sorry for your loss.
Trinidad: *sigh*... Yes, and Nanna wasn't the first...
Trinidad: Anyway, right now we're preparing for an exceptional Turnfire Night ceremony, and we need to find a suitable flame bearer. From what I've heard about your adventures, I believe you'd be perfect for the role.
Traveler: Don't you already have a flame bearer in the tribe?
Trinidad: Of course. Plus, he's a bona-fide hero who's inherited the Mal{RUBY#[D]Turnfire}ipo name.
Paimon: Oh, you mean Kinich!
Trinidad: Yes, he's the one. A hero worth his weight in gold — and unfortunately for us, he's all too aware of that... No prizes for guessing what he said when I asked him to host a Turnfire Night outside of the annual schedule.
Trinidad: "An exceptional ceremony? I'll have to charge an exceptional price." I swear, no other concept exists in that boy's brain...
Traveler: At least he's predictable. Fork over the Mora, and he's all yours.
Trinidad: I'm not the one to usually talk about people behind their backs, but I'm convinced the Wayob got hit on the head and took a wrong turn the day it chose to give that ancient name to him. Have you ever heard of a hero whose mantra is "What's your asking price"?
Trinidad: Oh, and don't get me started on that insufferable Ajaw he hangs around with. Thinks he's god's gift to mankind! Pompous fool...
Paimon: Yeah... Paimon has to agree on that last part!
Trinidad: Anyway, the fact is, the ceremony can just as easily be done without him as long as we find someone else — and besides, you two seem like much better candidates. Hehe... So, what do you think?
Traveler: Just tell me what I need to do next.
Trinidad: Wonderful! I can't thank you enough. Huni was right about you — you have kindness in your hearts.
Trinidad: Come with me to the other side of the mountain. I'll bring you up to speed on each step of the ceremony. As experienced warriors, I'm sure you'll pick it up in no time.
Traveler: What's in it for me?
Trinidad: You will gain the respect and friendship of the Scions of the Canopy. Something no amount of Mora can buy.
Traveler: Sounds good. It's a deal.
Traveler: Why don't I try to talk some sense into Kinich for you?
Trinidad: There's only a few days left before the ceremony — we can't afford to waste what little time we have on negotiating with him. I'd much prefer if you would consider taking his place.
Traveler: Alright, guess there's no other choice.
Traveler: Sounds like a professional adventurer to me.
Traveler: Of course. All we ask for is one million Mora.
Trinidad: One million Mora!? Hahaha! At least you're a straight-shooter. I can respect that much.

## Talk 2

Trinidad: Ugh, the Abyss contamination is back... No surprises there. No doubt that explains the Mountain King's recent activity.
Trinidad: See those torches over there? Those are sacred flame offshoots that we requested from the Stadium of the Sacred Flame. They contain the power of the Pyro Archon.
Paimon: Are you saying that the Sacred Flame and the Turnfire are the same thing?
Trinidad: Heh, for ceremonial purposes, at least. Sending someone to the Night Kingdom to retrieve the legendary Turnfire isn't exactly an option. More to the point though, the Sacred Flame is able to burn away Abyssal filth, so that's why we use it in the ceremony.
Paimon: Gotcha... So basically, we just need to clean up the filth with the Sacred Flame?
Trinidad: That's one part of it, yes. But the complete ceremony is a bit more complicated than that.
Trinidad: First, the flame bearer must collect a kindling of the Sacred Flame from the starting point, then use a grappling hook to fly up into the sky and light each of the Sacred Flame Pillars.
Trinidad: Then, they must go down into the canyon, all the way to the cave where the Mountain King slumbers, lighting braziers and the final altar along the way.
Trinidad: The most skilled flame bearers can accomplish all of this without touching the ground once. As much as I hate to admit it, Kinich is capable of this.
Paimon: Wow, he can do all that flying without ever falling to the ground?
Traveler: So can you, Paimon.
Paimon: Well, of course Paimon can! It'd be much harder for you guys.
Trinidad: Haha, well, don't worry — it's not a requirement of the ceremony. You're allowed to touch the ground. The only thing you're not allowed to do is turn back.
Trinidad: The flame bearer must always keep moving forward. You can't skip a pillar, then come back to it after lighting the next one. To do so would be to disrespect our ancestors.
Paimon: So... What actually happens if you do turn back? Surely the fires don't just go out?
Trinidad: Umm... Well, if you're not careful, you might get burned.
Paimon: What about today, then? Does the same rule apply?
Trinidad: Oh no, don't worry. Today is just a practice, the order doesn't matter. You just need to take the sacred flame, cleanse the filth, then go light all the braziers.
Trinidad: Are you ready?
Traveler: Let's begin.
Trinidad: I'll repeat the key points again. Gather the kindling, cleanse the filth, and light all the braziers. I'll wait for you at the end.

## Talk 3

Trinidad: I knew I was right about you. You have outperformed all of our previous candidates.
Trinidad: If there's an Ancient Name for outstanding flame bearers, I'm sure the Wayob would consider you for the honor.
Traveler: Paimon could probably get the job done, too.
Paimon: Yeah! Although, it would probably take Paimon quite a bit longer...
Trinidad: Haha. Alright, now there's still a few days left until the ceremony. I should probably get back so I can inform the chief and the other elders that I have found the flame bearer we need.
Paimon: Oh... You mean, they've still got to sign off on it?
Trinidad: Some of them are still hoping we can come to an agreement with Kinich. But that's only because they haven't seen you in action.
Trinidad: Still, I'm the one responsible for securing a flame bearer, and my recommendation is you.
Paimon: ...Just for Paimon's own peace of mind, are you sure it's not gonna be a problem having outlanders take on such an important role in your ceremony?
Trinidad: See that place over there? There was a time, long before the age of Burkina and the Mountain King, when we Scions of the Canopy called that our home.
Trinidad: After a period of upheaval, our ancestors were forced to move away. Now, it has become a place where our youths go to develop courage and kindle a spirit of adventure.
Trinidad: If we fail to keep the threat posed by the Mountain King at bay, it might not be long before we have to move again, and find a new home...
Trinidad: So, to answer your question, I think everyone will agree that you are the right choice.
Paimon: Fair enough. Desperate times call for desperate measures...
Trinidad: I'll need you to drop by my place at some point before the ceremony, if that's alright. There are still a few final details that we need to discuss.
Paimon: Okay, see you later then!
Trinidad: You have my gratitude.
Paimon: We've helped out with a lot of other local festivals before, but this one feels a little different... Anyway, let's take a break before heading back to Trinidad's place.

## Talk 4

Trinidad: Ready when you are. Oh, and I'll repeat the key points again. Gather the kindling, cleanse the filth, and light all the braziers.

## Talk 5

Ajaw: Achoo! Curses! Who dares insult the Great K'uhul Ajaw behind his back?
Enjou: Oh, Great K'uhul Ajaw! Bless you!
Ajaw: Shut your filthy mouth, worm of the Abyss! Your putrid words defile the air we breathe! You make the Almighty Dragonlord, K'uhul Ajaw sick to the stomach!
Enjou: Speaking as a member of the Abyss Order, that's music to my ears — exactly the kind of reaction we're going for. But on a personal level, I gotta say, it's pretty hurtful.
Ajaw: Never have we heard such brazen blustering from someone who is inches from death! Up yours, four-eyes! We spit in your face! *spitting sounds*
Enjou: Okay, well THAT I am at a loss to explain. How do I manage to stay so chirpy and cheerful? I can only guess it's some kind of powerful magic...
Enjou: But I digress. Mr. Kinich, I admit it — you, Sir, are a legendary hunter. Still, the only reason you caught me is that I was reluctant to run away.
Enjou: You see, I'm very interested in the lore of your tribe.
Kinich: Kay.
Enjou: ...Is that it? "'Kay"? Aren't you intrigued to know what it is about you guys that prompted a visit from the Abyss?
Enjou: It's the extreme sports! The other day, I narrowly avoided getting hit by a very brave soul who'd just leaped off a cliff... I think you call it "bungee jumping"? Anyway, I was very impressed! That is what I call embracing the spirit of adventure!
Enjou: Look, I even did a painting inspired by the bravery and freedom of the Scions of the Canopy...
Ajaw: You scum-sucking swine! I swear, if you go bungee jumping, it'll be without a rope!
Ajaw: Head-first off the tallest cliff, with a band of hunters on your tail! And nowhere left to run! And a bottomless cesspit waiting for you on the ground!
Enjou: You say that, but I get the sense that Mr. Kinich isn't planning to take my life right now. On top of that, I'm tired of spying on you from afar... So why don't we just negotiate a comfortable operating distance that works for both of us?
Enjou: I've heard that the most important thing in human relationships is to respect each other's boundaries. What do you say, Mr. Kinich?
Kinich: ...
Kinich: Or... you could tell me what it is you're really after.
Enjou: Wha...?
Kinich: And then I'll name my price.
