# Nora, Run!


## Talk 1

Nora: Hmm, what to do...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Nora: See the Anemo Archon statue? Now, look up there, the really high bit... where the archon's hands are.
Nora: I wanna go play up there... But Grace won't let me climb the statue.
Nora: Please can you go and talk to Grace for a bit? Don't let her look this way. I climb really quickly, I'll be up there in no time...
Traveler: I guess I can do that...
Nora: Yay, thanks!
Nora: Go and distract Aunty Grace for a minute, I'll go up right now...
Grace: Nora! No!
Grace: Phew, I look away for one second and she starts bothering you. I do apologize.
Nora: Whyyy! I just wanna play up there for a little bit...
Grace: No means no! Your father would not approve either.
Grace: And you — please refrain from indulging her! People would be just as worried about you if you did something so dangerous.
Traveler: It's much too dangerous.
Nora: It'll be fine, I'm really good at climbing!

## Talk 2

Nora: Wah...
Traveler: What do you want to do up there?
Nora: Aunty Grace says that if you want to tell someone a secret, you just need to tell it to a dandelion then throw it to the wind... The Anemo Archon will carry the dandelion seeds and the secret you told it to the person you want.
Nora: And the higher you throw it into the wind from, the faster your message will get there...
Nora: This one time, Glory got an adventurer to climb up the statue and throw some dandelion seeds into the wind for her. Just a few days later, Godwin wrote her a letter back!
Nora: I have a secret to tell Daddy, and I already got a dandelion.
Nora: But Aunty Grace won't let me do it. She says that I can go back and live with Daddy when I've grown up.
Nora: I wish there was a way to grow up faster... I'm trying as hard as I can, but I'm still so short...
Nora: Oh yeah— I always see you gliding around in the city. Can you teach me? How do you do it?
Traveler: Sure, I'll show you how.
Nora: Hee-hee, yay! I'll just stand by and watch, I'm sure I'm allowed to do that.
Traveler: You wanna glide with me?
Nora: No way! Aunty Grace would go mad if she saw me doing that.

## Talk 3

Traveler: I'm gonna take a breather...
Nora: Don't be too long.

## Talk 4

Grace: Oh, Nora...
Traveler: Are you her carer?
Grace: Yes, for a number of reasons her mother is... away from home. In the meantime, I'm taking care of her.
Grace: I also care for several other children who need someone to look after them. It's part of my duty as a sister.
Grace: It's like I suddenly got a whole new family of children. They're good kids, and they get on well with Glory, too.
Grace: Timmie's the one I've looked after longest. He's even started calling me Mommy...
Traveler: Tell me about Nora's father.
Grace: Patton is her father. His incessant drinking caused huge problems in the home.
Grace: The Church and the Knights of Favonius both gave him a number of warnings, but he would not change his ways. In the end, it was Master Diluc who took action.
Grace: Believing that Patton was in no shape to look after Nora, Sister Victoria put her under the care of the Church while Patton takes some time out to reflect.
Grace: But when Nora grows up, the excuse we keep giving her that "Daddy is busy with work and needs to be left alone..." It's going to wear thin.
Grace: And even the Anemo Archon's dandelions are limited in their reach.

## Talk 5

Nora: You flew there in {ChallengeCurrValue10} minute(s), that's amazing!
Nora: Do you wanna go again? I bet you could go even faster...
Nora: And I'll give you a prezzie if you do!

## Talk 6

Nora: Hmm, I thought it looked cooler last time... Did you glide the same way?

## Talk 7

Traveler: That's enough for today.
Nora: Okay... Time to have a rest.

## Talk 8

Nora: Wooow! When I'm bigger, will I be able to glide like that?
Traveler: For sure!
Nora: Woohoo! I'm gonna grow up as fast as possible, then, when Daddy's finished his work, he can play with me!
Nora: But maybe it's easier for grown-ups.
Nora: Thank you. Here, this is a present for you. It's some treasure that I collected in secret.
Nora: Quick, take it... Also, don't tell Aunty Grace!
Traveler: After you've got your gliding license, sure!
Nora: Gliding license? What's that? It sounds complicated...
