# A Secretary in a Sea of Humanity


## Talk 1

Paimon: We're finally back!
Ganyu: Eh... I'm still...
Paimon: Come on, Ganyu, we're almost there. You don't want to turn back now, do you?
Ganyu: I suppose you have a point. It would be quite impolite of me to leave the two of you now.
Paimon: That's right! Where do you wanna go first then?
Ganyu: I've spent too much time in the mountains. The first thing that comes to my mind is the sea.
Ganyu: Let's go for a walk in the port.
Paimon: Happy to come with!

## Talk 2

Ganyu: The sound of the waves in this familiar port...
Ganyu: The smell of the sea breeze makes me nostalgic.
Paimon: Ganyu, you didn't leave Liyue for that long. Why do you look so moved?
Ganyu: Well, I used to be so busy. I haven't taken a stroll around here in a long time.
Paimon: Huh... That's true, Ganyu seemed to be working all the time.
Ganyu: Well, when I think about my time here, I've spent most of it behind a desk, filing documents.
Ganyu: It put me in a certain mood — similar to the one I felt during my training in Jueyun Karst, in fact.
Uncle Tian: Is that... It is! It's Lady Ganyu!
Uncle Tian: Hahaha... I wouldn't have thought I'd meet you here. You were always so terribly busy.
Paimon: "Lady Ganyu"? Why are you calling her that?
Traveler: It's a bit awkward.
Ganyu: Ahem... Allow me to introduce Uncle Tian, he is...
Uncle Tian: That's alright, just tell them the truth. They have done so much for Liyue, after all, and I am the one who has yet to introduce myself.
Ganyu: ...Uncle Tian is a member of the Liyue Qixing, the "Tianshu."
Paimon: What! This grandpa is a member of the Qixing?
Paimon: The same rank as Ningguang!?
Uncle Tian: Hush, now... I must ask for your discretion concerning my identity.
Uncle Tian: Fishing in the port and strolling about are the greatest pleasures of my life. I have no wish to be followed around by those armed guards.
Uncle Tian: In most people's eyes, I'm just a forgetful and wordy old man.
Ganyu: Uncle Tian is too modest. He's been around for a long time. There's no one who can replace a person of such noble character.
Traveler: Don't judge a book by its cover, they say...
Uncle Tian: Hahahaha... Ah, what an honor to receive such high praise from Lady Ganyu herself! I guess I must have done something right over the last... however many decades.
Ganyu: Uncle Tian, please... A person of your standing should really stop calling me "Lady Ganyu"...
Uncle Tian: Uh, my apologies. It's not intentional, just a habit from my younger days.
Uncle Tian: Thank you for looking after me when I first ascended to my position in the Qixing.
Paimon: Ooh, so you've been friends for many decades now, huh?
Ganyu: Oh, I was just fulfilling my duties as the Qixing's secretary. It's nothing worthy of your gratitude.
Uncle Tian: Talking about "secretaries"... *sigh* I don't know if I should bring it up. Ganyu, I believe you know my daughter, Huixin? She seems to be a bit... troubled, recently.
Ganyu: Yes, she works at Yuehai Pavilion, and she's my junior. How can I help her?
Uncle Tian: Hehe, I don't know myself, really. She's all grown-up now and doesn't like to ask for my help.
Uncle Tian: May I trouble you to meet her at Yuehai Pavilion? She just needs a bit of guidance.
Ganyu: With pleasure. Solving the Qixing's problems has always been in my job description.
Paimon: (She's back in character, just like that, huh...)
Traveler: As expected of a Qixing member, he's actually helping Ganyu.
Paimon: Let's move then! To Yuehai Pavilion!
Traveler: I'm afraid Ganyu didn't even notice.
Traveler: I'm trying to remember if I've ever messed with him...
Traveler: Little Miss Ganyu!
Ganyu: Ah... Please don't also start calling me that...

## Talk 3

Huixin: Ms. Ganyu! It's been too long!
Huixin: I don't know why, but seeing you brings me a sense of peace in these chaotic times.
Ganyu: Indeed, it has been a while, Huixin. I'm flattered, but aren't you exaggerating a little?
Ganyu: I heard that you've encountered some problems, and came to see if I could be of some help.
Huixin: *sigh* My father asked you to come, didn't he?
Huixin: Abusing his status as a member of the Qixing to trouble you...
Ganyu: Hehe, don't worry. I'm always happy to help a junior colleague from Yuehai Pavilion.
Paimon: Ganyu's not only a competent secretary but also a great mentor.
Ganyu: So, what can you tell me about the problem?
Huixin: Uh, where should I start? I discovered something strange while organizing tax records...
Huixin: There are obvious irregularities in the tax declarations of two stores: Second Life and Wanyou Boutique. However, whether I question the shopkeepers or check their accounts, I... I can't seem to make any progress with my investigation.
Huixin: Without any evidence, my hands are tied.
Ganyu: I see. It's not uncommon for merchants to be blinded by greed.
Huixin: Well, is there any solution you can advise?
Ganyu: Naturally. I've dealt with similar issues hundreds of times. Give me a moment to consider the best approach in this scenario...
Traveler: That's a thousand years of work experience for you...
Ganyu: Alright... Let's approach it this way, then: "Your enemy knows you best."
Huixin: Huh?
Ganyu: If I remember correctly, Second Life and Wanyou Boutique are old business rivals, competing for market share due to their similar wares.
Ganyu: In that case...
Huixin: In that case... Ah, I know what you mean, Ms. Ganyu!
Traveler: I still don't get it.
Huixin: Ms. Ganyu plans to let them expose each other.
Ganyu: Let's start with Wanyou Boutique. The owner's name is... Bolai, isn't it?
Huixin: Yes, you're right. Follow me, please!
Traveler: You want them to expose each other?
Ganyu: Exactly.

## Talk 4

Bolai: Aha, we meet again, Traveler. And you must be... from the Yuehai Pavilion?
Bolai: Hehe, I suppose you're about to place a big order. I'd be honored to offer you my wares.
Ganyu: That won't be necessary, Mr. Bolai. Wanyou Boutique's credit is not sufficient to accept orders directly from Yuehai Pavilion.
Ganyu: Should we need to place such an order, we would certainly go to Second Life instead.
Bolai: What! Second Life!?
Bolai: Ugh... That rascal Dongsheng, he's stealing all of my customers.
Ganyu: Well, Second Life's credit has always been excellent, and based on their tax records, their business is thriving...
Bolai: Hohoho... Tax records? Thriving?
Ganyu: Huh? Is there anything you'd like to share with us, Mr. Bolai?
Bolai: Don't let that rascal fool you. I know his dirty tricks best.
Bolai: If you don't believe me, show me his tax records. I'm sure I'll find something fishy in there.
Ganyu: You know Second Life's business so well?
Bolai: Of course! Their every transaction makes my blood boil!
Bolai: I'd rather lose money myself than see that rascal make some!
Traveler: Is that how competitors behave?
Ganyu: Well then, please look over this tax record. We'll review Second Life's credit based on your observations.
Bolai: Oh, of course. I'll read very, very carefully...
Bolai: Line by line and word by word...
Bolai: Ah! Here! I found it!
Bolai: That exquisite, wooden furniture set he bought from Fanmu Carpenter's at the beginning of the year? He even flaunted it in front of me!
Bolai: Look at the tax record, not a word about that furniture. And he kept all the profit for himself!
Huixin: I see. He must've gotten rid of all the documents related to this transaction. No wonder there was no trace of it.
Bolai: Hmph, I told you so. Just as I expected. I can't wait to watch him squirm.
Huixin: But Ms. Ganyu... Despite all this, can't he just flat out deny ever making this transaction?
Ganyu: He might have destroyed all the evidence, but I believe the supplier, Fanmu Carpenter's, might still have some proof of it.
Bolai: Aha, you're right! Master Lu from Fanmu Carpenter's must still have the invoice. He wouldn't be swayed by the likes of Dongsheng.
Ganyu: I hope so. Let's go to Fanmu Carpenter's. It should be near Qingce Village.
Ganyu: Thank you for shining a light on this case, Mr. Bolai.
Bolai: Oh, please, please, that's nothing. I just hope you won't be lenient with him once you find the evidence. That's the best way to show your gratitude.
Huixin: *sigh* I'm afraid I can't go to Qingce Village...
Ganyu: It's alright, Huixin. You can stay in Liyue Harbor and finish your work. Leave the rest to us.
Huixin: Ah, that's so considerate of you. Still, I'm sorry to trouble you like that.
Traveler: That's real petty!

## Talk 5

Master Lu: Ah, welcome, welcome. How can an old carpenter like me help you?
Master Lu: I'm usually happy to take new apprentices, but I'm afraid I can't take too many at once. But I'm always around if you're keen for a chat...
Paimon: Qingce really is full of lonely old people.
Master Lu: Hey, I heard that, flying one!
Paimon: Ah, Paimon's sorry!
Ganyu: Master Lu, we've just come to see you and ask you some questions.
Master Lu: Hahaha... Ah, don't worry, I know — you're from the Yuehai Pavilion, right?
Master Lu: Why would the Qixing care about an old man like me? Well, whatever. You said that you want to ask me something — ask away, then.
Ganyu: Hehehe, you're very direct, Master Lu. I will be plain — we're looking for proof that Dongsheng from Second Life has been evading taxation.
Ganyu: Dongsheng bought some furniture from you at the beginning of the year. Do you still have the invoice or any other record of that transaction?
Master Lu: Oh, it's about Second Life. It was a big order, how could I forget?
Ganyu: Sure enough, Mr. Bolai was right.
Ganyu: Could we perhaps borrow that invoice? We won't have any evidence to bring against Dongsheng otherwise.
Master Lu: Of course you can.
Master Lu: But... I'm not so sprightly anymore.
Paimon: Uh, what's that supposed to mean?
Master Lu: I only do my woodwork and display finished wares here at Fanmu Carpenter's.
Master Lu: As for old documents and such, I keep them all in a warehouse, west of here.
Master Lu: But some troublemakers have recently moved there, invading my warehouse. I tried to drive them away, but they just wouldn't leave...
Master Lu: Since you need that invoice anyway... it may best to get it from the warehouse yourself. And while you're at it, you can teach those louts a lesson.
Ganyu: So that's what happened. I see.
Master Lu: I'll leave you to it then. I need to get back to work.
Paimon: Take back the warehouse, find the invoice... Time for us to show our stuff in a fight!
Ganyu: Wait. I think I saw one of those troublemakers... Ah, over there!
Paimon: Oh! Paimon sees them, too. It's one of the Fatui!
Traveler: What are they doing here?
Ganyu: They must be plotting something against Liyue Harbor.
Paimon: Maybe they're the scoundrels who invaded Master Lu's warehouse.
Traveler: Shouldn't we observe him for a while first?
Ganyu: Ever since Osial attacked the harbor, the Fatui's reputation in Liyue has reached rock bottom.
Ganyu: We won't cause a serious diplomatic crisis by getting into some small scuffle with the Fatui within our borders. You need not worry.
Ganyu: Besides, I can already feel their malicious intentions. Consider it...
Ganyu: ...My intuition as the secretary of the Qixing.
Paimon: Then what are we waiting for? Let's go teach him a lesson!
Traveler: What is he trying to do?

## Talk 6

Fatui Skirmisher: *cough*... You... Scoundrels...
Ganyu: I think you've had enough. About time you tell us your plan, no?
Fatui Skirmisher: Plan... What plan?
Ganyu: We just taught you a lesson, but clearly, you weren't paying attention.
Ganyu: If you don't spill whatever you're scheming against Liyue...
Ganyu: We'll be forced to use harsher methods.
Traveler: I think we were harsh enough.
Fatui Skirmisher: I'm telling the truth. There's no scheme.
Ganyu: If you're telling the truth, then why would you, a member of the Fatui, suddenly appear on the outskirts of Qingce Village?
Fatui Skirmisher: Fine. If you really want to know, then, well... I was about to...
Paimon: About to... what?
Fatui Skirmisher: ...Pick Berries over there.
Ganyu: Um...
Ganyu: I must admit, I didn't expect you to come up with such a silly excuse.
Fatui Skirmisher: It's not an excuse! I rarely have a free morning, and I heard that there were fresh Berries in this area...
Fatui Skirmisher: Think about it. I'm here alone and Qingce Village is nothing more than a retirement spot for old people. What could I be scheming, anyway?
Paimon: Judging by how he's looking at us, it does seem like he feels like he's the victim here.
Ganyu: So you have nothing to do with the occupation of Fanmu Carpenter's warehouse?
Fatui Skirmisher: Fanmu Carpenter's warehouse? Where is that?
Fatui Skirmisher: I swear, I only came here to pick Berries, that's all.
Paimon: So it wasn't the Fatui who took over Master Lu's warehouse, after all...
Traveler: We might have blamed him for nothing.
Ganyu: I also feel... that he's telling the truth.
Paimon: Uh, um... Whoopsie...
Ganyu: I misjudged the situation and offended you. My apologies.
Ganyu: Our... Uh... Our exchange only represents my personal views. If you wish it so, you can file a complaint to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Fatui Skirmisher: Exchange!?
Fatui Skirmisher: (T-this woman! She's clearly aware that the Ministry of Civil Affairs wouldn't side with us Fatui...)
Ganyu: Yes, precisely. As an alternative, you may... try to solve this problem with force once again.
Paimon: Paimon's in~!
Fatui Skirmisher: D—Darn you... How can you wear that solemn face while bullying me like this...
Ganyu: What's your choice then?
Fatui Skirmisher: ...I'll get back to my Berries.
Traveler: Good choice.
Paimon: What a bittersweet ending!
Ganyu: I made a laughingstock out of myself. I might've spent too much time away from work — my intuition is not as accurate as it used to be.
Paimon: No worries! It's always nice to teach the Fatui a lesson!
Ganyu: Hehe... Let's keep moving towards Master Lu's warehouse. Our goal is to get the invoice, after all.
Traveler: The Fatui get what they deserve!
Traveler: So that's it?
Traveler: Quick, tell us everything!

## Talk 7

Huixin: Ah! Ms. Ganyu, you're back.
Huixin: I hope it wasn't too much trouble rushing about like that...
Ganyu: I promised to help you and I'll keep my word. Nothing to worry about.
Ganyu: Look, it's the invoice for the transaction between Second Life and Fanmu Carpenter's. We've brought it back.
Huixin: *sigh* Thank you so much! Now we can solve this problem.
Ganyu: Agreed. How about we go to Second Life and... have a nice chat with the owner?

## Talk 8

Traveler: So, about those tax records...
Dongsheng: Isn't it... Huixin from the Yuehai Pavilion? I remember you.
Dongsheng: I told you that all of my transactions are included in the records. My tax declarations are scrupulous, as well.
Dongsheng: I do hope that my business won't be affected by any groundless accusations.
Ganyu: Groundless accusations? Mr. Dongsheng, you seem very sure of yourself.
Ganyu: But I sincerely advise that you cease this behavior immediately. It is liable to affect the fine you'll need to pay in the end.
Dongsheng: Ah... No, no, I'm an honest merchant. I would never get involved with any fraudulent sources of profit.
Traveler: You've got no shame.
Ganyu: Haven't I made myself clear? Mr. Dongsheng, you've already been proven guilty of tax evasion. I just came here to see if you'd confess.
Dongsheng: What? P—Proven guilty? H—How come? That's impossible. Absolutely absurd!
Paimon: He's talking without rhyme or reason. Must be crumbling under Ganyu's pressure.
Paimon: Time for the finishing blow!
Huixin: Mr. Dongsheng, can you tell me what this is?
Dongsheng: I... It... It's an invoice from Fanmu Carpenter's!
Dongsheng: I... I'm... Master Lu, he... I didn't...
Huixin: Do you admit to tax evasion? This transaction was absent from the tax record.
Dongsheng: *sigh* I didn't think you'd find out. I didn't leave a single trace.
Ganyu: Indeed, we wouldn't have found out if it weren't for Mr. Bolai's aid.
Dongsheng: Bolai? That imp from Wanyou Boutique... So he told on me behind my back!
Dongsheng: Hmph, he's got his own share of dirty laundry...
Ganyu: Oh? Mr. Dongsheng, I'd like to hear a little more about this "dirty laundry." Would you care to elaborate?
Ganyu: I don't think you'll need my guidance for what comes next.
Huixin: Yes, thank you, Ms. Ganyu! I can take it from here.
Ganyu: Hehe. That's good.
Huixin: *sigh* I must say, you're truly impressive, Ms. Ganyu.
Huixin: "Your enemy knows you best."
Huixin: To think — you came up with this plan and executed it so masterfully.
Ganyu: Hehe. It's actually one of your father's — the Tianshu's — old tricks. I just took some inspiration from it.
Huixin: M—My father!
Ganyu: Pitting your opponent against their enemies and watching them drag each other down from an advantageous position.
Ganyu: That's how Uncle Tian managed to keep his position in the Qixing secure for so many years.
Ganyu: I figured that as Uncle Tian's daughter, you'd naturally grasp your father's strategies.
Ganyu: So I decided to use one of your father's tricks and play it out for you to see.
Huixin: *sigh* I can see it now... Clearly, I still have a lot to learn about my father.
Huixin: I'm really grateful, Ms. Ganyu! Heh, you're the kindest mentor I've ever had! Thank you!
Paimon: Ganyu's solved both Huixin's work and family problems. Two birds with one stone!
Huixin: Oh, you've helped me so much. You must... You must allow me to repay your kindness...
Ganyu: Ah, that's not necessary. No need to be so serious. It was nothing, really.
Huixin: Then... let me treat you to a meal, hmm? The Traveler and Paimon are invited as well. I appreciate your help!
Paimon: Alright! Come on, Ganyu, just say yes! Let's eat!
Traveler: Paimon, don't forget your manners.
Paimon: Oh, come on, it's just a meal!
Ganyu: If it's just a meal... there's no reason for me to decline. It'll be my pleasure, Huixin.
Paimon: Hee-hee!
Huixin: Actually, I've already booked Xinyue Kiosk. I need a moment to prepare everything first. Let's meet there in a while!
Ganyu: Hmm, alright. We dare not refuse such generosity.
Traveler: Let's wait for Ganyu's decision.
Traveler: Not so confident now, are you?

## Talk 9

Uncle Tian: Eh, don't think too much about it. My daughter really needs Ganyu's help, and there's nothing more to it, hehe...

## Talk 10

Master Lu: Don't forget to drive those hooligans away. It'll save me the trouble of asking for the Millelith's help, too...
