Shana: The smell of Grilled Fish covered in Mint Sauce... Mint Sauce...

Traveler: I love Grilled Fish too.
Shana: Oho... When you tear open the crispy skin, the shiny fishy flesh inside couldn't be more like freshly-made competition equipment if it tried...
Shana: And as an engineer, I'm the first person that gets to experience it!
Shana: ...Of course, our testing equipment is meant for safety inspections, which is a whole other kettle of fish from grilling, well, fish.

Traveler: I quite like Mints myself.
Shana: Oho... Such a cool texture, and what a refreshing aftertaste. Just like placing your hand on a machine that's just been wiped clean...
Shana: Ahh, the smell of steel, as fresh as a handful of Mint!
Shana: ...Of course, you can eat Mint, but I'd advise against actually trying to taste an ice-cold Iron Chunk.

Traveler: See you.

Traveler: I'm sure safety still comes into play when grilling fish, right?
Shana: Well, you've got me there.
Shana: True, you do need to be careful with both the fire and the ingredients used. Things could get really ugly if you ate poisonous fish! That would be like using cracked components!

Traveler: Thanks for the reminder.
Shana: Indeed. Of course, you won't often find cold metal around these parts.
Shana: Or in simpler terms, everyone can just use processed materials.
