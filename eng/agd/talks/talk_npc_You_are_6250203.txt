Traveler: You are?
Pingshan: I'm the owner of this tea stall, and I'm also in charge of cleaning the Yilong Dais daily.
Pingshan: This place used to be full of tourists. I took over this job from my master almost twenty years ago, and I've lit the Crane Crown Incense for countless guests.
Pingshan: Whether it was the popularity of this place causing all sorts of paintings and photos to circulate, or maybe too many people had heard of or seen this place for themselves already...
Pingshan: But either way, it's not as appealing as before. Things haven't been as busy as it was years ago.
Pingshan: But times change. No point crying over that.
Pingshan: I plan to recruit an apprentice, so they can carry this tradition forward.
Pingshan: Then I want to make time to find several writers to write about the Yilong Dais, and promote our stories.
Pingshan: For all I know, more people might realize that coming to the Yilong Dais to light a Crane Crown Incense will really make their wishes come true.
