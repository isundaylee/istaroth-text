# Perfect Shot


## Talk 1

Ji Tong: Ah, hello. Just the person I wanted to speak to.
Traveler: About what?
Ji Tong: Nope, no need. I've figured out what it was.
Ji Tong: I finally managed to track down the merchant the other day. The one who sold it to me in the first place.
Ji Tong: I told him there was a problem with the Kamera he sold me, but he was having none of it.
Ji Tong: Luckily I had all the photos you took for me. Without them, I'd have had no way of convincing him.
Ji Tong: After taking a look at your photos, he finally agreed to take a look at the Kamera he sold to me.
Ji Tong: Yesterday, he came to see me and brought a bottle of some sort of potion with him.
Ji Tong: He explained that this Kamera works differently from regular models. You need to add some of this potion to it to make sure the photos turn out normal.
Ji Tong: If you don't add any, the photos turn out just like yours did. Just pages of color, rather than clear images.
Traveler: Good thing that your Kamera's not broken, then.
Ji Tong: Well... To be honest, I'm less interested in the Kamera itself now. This potion is what intrigues me...
Ji Tong: Think about it. Most people will just buy the Kamera, right? Buy it once, use it forever.
Ji Tong: But this potion is a consumable. So, once you've used it up, you have to buy more if you want to keep using it.
Ji Tong: Also, the guy says that different potions will produce photos with different effects. He's currently developing more types...
Ji Tong: Maybe... Just maybe, those bottles of potion are where the big business opportunity is.
Ji Tong: Ah, sorry. I'm rambling.
Ji Tong: Thanks for all your help. Hand me this Kamera, I'll add some potion in for you...
Traveler: So... problem sorted?
Traveler: About strong-color photography?

## Talk 2

Ji Tong: Traveler, hold on a second.
Traveler: What's up?
Ji Tong: I know this is a bit sudden, but... Do you have any interest in Kameras?
Traveler: Sure, a little.
Ji Tong: Well, this Kamera here is no ordinary Kamera. It uses the latest technology from Fontaine.
Ji Tong: The photos printed by this model all come with a unique effect not offered by standard Kameras.
Traveler: How does it do that?
Ji Tong: Hey! I'm telling the absolute truth here. If you don't believe me, you can ask about it at the Adventurers' Guild.
Ji Tong: I was skeptical at first, too. I played around with it for ages, but couldn't get it working. Eventually, one of the adventurers from the Guild gave me a hand.
Ji Tong: Now. You must be wondering, what makes this Kamera so different? Well, it's to do with the internal design.
Ji Tong: It takes a certain kind of potion that adds a special effect during the printing process, making the photos look much better than those printed by your average Kamera.
Ji Tong: What do you think? If you're interested, I can let you play around with this one for a while. It has a limited variety of potions, but enough for you to get a feel for how it works.
Ji Tong: I plan to make a trip to Fontaine at some point and purchase some new varieties of potions. So, if you're interested, I hope to have your custom then.
Traveler: Alright then... Thanks...
Ji Tong: Please, keep this Kamera as a token of my esteem. If you enjoy using it, I'd appreciate your business in the future.
Traveler: How much do they cost?
Ji Tong: Oh, heh, don't you worry about that side of things. They're already very cheap when purchased individually, and if you plan on buying in bulk, we can discuss discounts...
Traveler: ...For real?
Traveler: Not interested, sorry.

## Talk 3

Ji Tong: Alright, this Kamera is yours to keep. Take care of it.
Traveler: ...You're just gonna give it to me?
Ji Tong: There's enough potion in there for you to get a good amount of use out of it. Once it runs out... Well, you know where to find me, right?
Ji Tong: While we're on the subject, I'm planning to talk to my contact about importing some new kinds of potions for the Kamera.
Ji Tong: If you find that's something that interests you, I hope to see you here again in the future.
Ji Tong: Thought I was just buying a Kamera, turns out I was buying a whole business venture...
Traveler: What happens when the potion runs out?
