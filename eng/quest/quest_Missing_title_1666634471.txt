Traveler: About the Fortress of Meropide...
Darcy: I actually like living here! When I was outside, I lived a life with my days and nights all topsy turvy, sleepless at night, dispirited and listless during the day...
Darcy: But ever since I arrived in the Fortress of Meropide, I've led a regular and healthy life!
Darcy: If you have had similar issues, I recommend you stay a while longer!
