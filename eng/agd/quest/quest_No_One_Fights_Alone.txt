# No One Fights Alone

Xilonen: The Children of Echoes' territory is secure. All monsters down.
Kachina: I'll go deal with the Abyss Tumor!
Mualani: All good here at the People of the Springs, too. We crushed it!
Citlali: Masters of the Night-Wind are also safe. Should I go support the Flower-Feather Clan?
Ororon: Things are still pretty rough over there. I'm already en route.
Chasca: No need. I just dealt with it.
Paimon: Already!? But you were just at the Stadium!
Chasca: Yeah, well. You have no idea how long I've been itching to bash some heads in.
Paimon: Oh... Fair enough...
Mualani: Iansan, what should we do about the Collective of Plenty? Your home's a long ways away from the stadium.
Iansan: Oh, no need to worry. I just heard from Varesa, she says they're safe now.
Kinich: Sounds like all regions are secured. The Abyss forces are weakening.
Paimon: Yeah! Their only game-plan was to outnumber us, and that ain't gonna work now that we have the Ode of Resurrection on our side!
Kinich: Hold up... The Abyss is sending a sizeable unit towards the Stadium.
Kinich: I guess they've realized that the Ode of Resurrection is a game changer, so now, they are going to try to destroy the sacred flame.
Mualani: We ain't gonna let them get away with that. Friends, let's gather at the stadium!
Xilonen: More Abyss Tumors have descended, all near the Stadium. Let's split up and take them out.
Xilonen: Oh, and we need someone to guard the main entrance.
Traveler: Allow me.
Mualani: Alright. This is the final battle!
