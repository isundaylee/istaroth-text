Traveler: Just like you?
Shima Masaoki: Correct.
Shima Masaoki: I wasn't born into this position as a military officer.
Shima Masaoki: I came from nothing, relying on nothing but my own diligence and dedication to earn recognition from the old Hatamoto lord, gradually rising through the ranks from infantry to one of the Hatamoto forces.
Shima Masaoki: The clan name I have the pleasure to humbly serve is a symbol of my pride!
Shima Masaoki: My experience is evidence that if you work tirelessly, you will be successful.
Shima Masaoki: If these new soldiers work as hard as I have, they too will eventually earn a place among the Hatamoto forces!
