Michiru: After waiting for so long, our daughter has finally returned home!
Yoh: Well, you look happy.
Michiru: Our daughter has returned! Of course I, her mother, am happy! Aren't you?
Yoh: Of course I am! But you need to stop pulling her aside to tell her all sorts of things. She'll get sick of it!
Michiru: ...Atsuko's been gone so long... There's so much I want to talk to her about.
Yoh: Well, keep talking, then. I mean, what's the worst that could happen? That she might leave once she tires of your yakking?
Michiru: Hah! Don't you try to scare me. I've already thought all this through.
Michiru: Since she likes exploring so much, we should just let her â€” all I ask is that she sends us letters to tell us how she's doing.
Michiru: I mean, it will still get a little lonely when she's not around...
Yoh: Come on, you'll still have me!
Michiru: Hah, as if that's the same thing.
