# The Origin of the Lanterns


## Talk 1

Verr Goldet: Lantern Rite is nearly here, why don't we decorate the inn this year...
Traveler: "Lantern Rite"?
Verr Goldet: Oh! Don't you know? On the first full moon of the first month each year, Liyue celebrates the Lantern Rite.
Verr Goldet: It's a festival to commemorate the heroes from the past. After dark, the people release Xiao and Mingxiao Lanterns into the night sky.
Verr Goldet: Ah... "May the flames of wisdom spread to all, and never be extinguished." This is the meaning of the lanterns. We believe they act as the beacons in the night, guiding bygone heroes back to their homeland.
Paimon: Wow... It sounds like a grand festival.
Paimon: And where there's a grand festival, there's always special seasonal snacks!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, you catch Paimon's drift?
Verr Goldet: You want to get involved in the Lantern Rite? That's great! The festive period leading up to the day itself is all part of the celebrations.
Verr Goldet: Haha... During this time, we pray to bring peace and ward off bad luck. Liyue locals call it "bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new."
Verr Goldet: If you're looking to take part, it's not too late.
Verr Goldet: Oh, um... also...
Traveler: Also what?
Verr Goldet: If you're able to... ahem... could you... try to convince Xiao to go with you?
Verr Goldet: We're not close, I wouldn't know how to ask him myself. But it seems that you've grown familiar...
Traveler: Still, given his current mood...
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon thinks it might be best to leave him alone for a few days...
Verr Goldet: I suppose you're right... Anyway! Just thought I'd mention it. You should get yourselves down to <color=#00E1FFFF>the harbor</color>.
Verr Goldet: If you leave too late, the city will be crowded with people, and you won't be able to make the most of it.
Verr Goldet: Get going! Happy Lantern Rite!

## Talk 2

Traveler: It's not for sale!
Traveler: Trust me, you couldn't afford it.
Bolai: #Young {M#man}{F#lady}, if I may be so bold. How much for the floating thing?
Paimon: Paimon's not for sale!
Paimon: What a strange thing to say!
Paimon: But Paimon's curious... What number did you have in mind, exactly?
Paimon: Ugh, forget it. Let's assume you meant Paimon is worth more than Mora can buy.
Bolai: Hahaha... As a matter of fact, I'm having some financial trouble recently. I probably couldn't afford it.
Bolai: I'm just a small-time merchant anyway, I don't deal in rare and exotic treasures.
Paimon: Y'know, the more you talk, the more suspicious you sound...
Bolai: My, someone's in a grumpy mood aren't they? Here, maybe some candy will make you feel better?
Traveler: Ah, typical Paimon...
Paimon: ...Ooh, suspiciously trustworthy!
Bolai: So, I assume you two are in Liyue for the Lantern Rite?
Bolai: This year's Mingxiao Lantern is supposed to be a sight well worth the wait. The Plaustrite that will lift the lantern into the air is the largest in twenty years!
Bolai: It's big enough to make you wonder... if the fabled floating city in the clouds really does exist...
Bolai: I guess it must just be held up by a similarly sized chunk of Plaustrite.
Paimon: Sounds awesome!
Bolai: Haha! I hope our paths cross again. Welcome to Liyue! ...Well, I can't speak for the whole of <color=#00E1FFFF>Liyue Harbor</color>, but you're always welcome in my store at least!

## Talk 3

Changchang: I'm Changchang, I just donated Dolly. She's my ragdoll.
Changchang: Last night in my dream, Dolly told me her wish was to fly up into the sky and see the view.
Changchang: So I gave her to the lady over by the big deer lantern. Dolly's wish will come true now, won't it?
Changchang: I did the right thing, didn't I? Wishes are supposed to come true at the Lantern Rite, aren't they?

## Talk 4

Madame Ping: This year's Mingxiao Lantern is dedicated to Skybracer... He always was a show off — I'm sure he will be very pleased!
Traveler: Who's Skybracer?
Madame Ping: This year's Mingxiao Lantern will be the spitting image of him when it's complete!
Madame Ping: Well, that's the plan. I do hope they make the antlers big enough, they were his pride and joy after all.
Madame Ping: The story goes that the antlers were made from the very essence of Rex Lapis' divine power, which made it the hardest material in all of Liyue.
Madame Ping: But then, that fateful battle happened... The gods exchanged powerful blows, and the mountains started collapsing. To avoid impacting the villagers at the foot of the mountain, the adeptus got his friend to chop his antlers off...
Madame Ping: He used those blood-drenched antlers as a wedge to prop up the mountain. And if that wasn't enough of a sacrifice, he then kept on fighting until his blood was drained and his life ran out...
Madame Ping: Thanks to him, Mt. Tianheng still stands tall and proud to this day. And the blood that he lost in the battle turned into the Bishui River.
Madame Ping: Hehehe... Whether you believe the story or not, I'm just happy you're willing to listen to me tell it.
Madame Ping: Surely, the reason the Lantern Rite exists is because people throughout the ages have chosen to come together as friends rather than stay in isolation.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Madame Ping: Goodbye. May the flames of wisdom spread to all, and never be extinguished.

## Talk 5

Paimon: #Look, {NICKNAME}! That stone is floating! Luckily, it's tethered in place.
Paimon: If it wasn't held down, who knows where it would fly off to?
Jiangzhou: This is the Plaustrite to be used for the Mingxiao Lantern. The whole of the Xiao Market is centered around it.
Paimon: Oh, hello. Who are you?
Jiangzhou: I'm Jiangzhou. Recently, I've been tracking progress on the construction of the Mingxiao Lantern.
Jiangzhou: You seem like newcomers — is this your first Lantern Rite?
Paimon: Yes... How can you tell?
Jiangzhou: Well, I don't remember running into any weird and wonderful mascots at last year's festival.
Traveler: What is the Mingxiao Lantern, exactly?
Jiangzhou: You'll see lots of people releasing little lanterns during the festival — those ones are called Xiao Lanterns. But there's also a huge one, a joint effort by all the people of Liyue Harbor. That one is called the Mingxiao Lantern.
Jiangzhou: Almost every business in Liyue has a booth at the annual Xiao Market — but despite its popularity, this is the one time of the year they're not looking to make a profit. The street market exists solely to raise the funds and materials required for the Mingxiao Lantern construction.
Paimon: So this Xiao Market... Does it have stuff you can eat?
Jiangzhou: Plenty! And if I do say so myself, the Lantern Rite is the best festival for sampling Liyue's local delicacies.
Jiangzhou: It is Liyue's biggest annual festival, after all. Showing off your craft is a great way to drum up a reputation.
Jiangzhou: So, even if there's no Mora to be made, everyone is secretly going all out to get their produce under the spotlight.
Paimon: Folks in Liyue are so smart...
Jiangzhou: If you need any help, you can look for <color=#00E1FFFF>Wang'ya</color>, she's overseeing the Lantern Rite.
Jiangzhou: She's usually somewhere around the Xiao Market, she's your first port of call.
Paimon: Ooh, will she know which stall sells the tastiest stuff?
Jiangzhou: No doubt. When it comes to the Lantern Rite, no one knows more than she does.
Paimon: #Got it! {NICKNAME}, let's go to the Xiao Market and look for <color=#00E1FFFF>Wang'ya</color>!
Paimon: And then... go to the stall with the tastiest food and eat till we're stuffed!

## Talk 6

Wang'ya: Hi, can I help you?
Wang'ya: Huh, from the look of you, you don't hail from Liyue... Are you traveling through? Welcome to the Xiao Market.
Traveler: Are you overseeing Lantern Rite?
Wang'ya: Overseeing... Not exactly. The Lantern Rite festival belongs to the whole of Liyue, it's not just one person's to oversee.
Wang'ya: I'm just taking care of a few small things. Doing my bit to make sure everyone who joins in the festivities has a good time.
Traveler: I've got a few things I'd like to ask...
Paimon: We want to know where the tastiest food in the whole wide Xiao Market is!
Wang'ya: Hmm... the tastiest? Hard to say, I guess that depends on your personal preference. Still, what I can tell you is that everyone's talking about <color=#00E1FFFF>Yi'nian's</color> stall.
Wang'ya: If it gets any busier over there, I'm going to have to bring the Millelith to keep things orderly.
Wang'ya: Hey, you'd best get over there quick before the streets get too crowded with people.
Wang'ya: Oh, and if you are heading to Yi'nian, please do me a favor and run this document over to him.
Wang'ya: It's a summary of the data from last year's Lantern Rite, compiled by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. It has a few operational tips for our vendors. If you're heading in that direction, it'd be a great help.
Wang'ya: As thanks, I've got a gift for you, when you get back.

## Talk 7

Yi'nian: We really don't have enough hands on deck, if I'd known, I would've roped some others in...
Paimon: What's the best thing on the menu!?
Yi'nian: Ah, customers. Take a look and decide for yourself. I can do anything on the menu. Or if there's something in particular you're after, I can do that instead!
Paimon: Woo-hoo! Paimon'll have...
Paimon: Huh. Now that you mention it, you do have a lot of options for a food stall...
Yi'nian: Naturally! If there's a dish I can't cook, I've yet to hear about it.
Traveler: This is a document from Wang'ya.
Yi'nian: Aha, same every year... the ol' operational tips! How's this for a tip — leave the handbook to one side and concentrate on the killer cooking!
Yi'nian: Ugh, hand it over. I'll use it to feed the fire later.
Yi'nian: Come on then, place your orders, aren't ya here to eat?
Paimon: There are so many... This one looks good, but Paimon wants to try that one too...
Paimon: Eh? Grilled Tiger Fish? That's the one Pervases loved to eat, isn't it?
Paimon: Hmm... Seeing as the Lantern Rite is about commemorating the heroes of the past, let's order this one. This can be our way of honoring his memory.
Traveler: You mean your way of ordering your dinner...
Yi'nian: Ah, your friend has a good eye for food. That's our specialty.
Yi'nian: Please wait, I'll have it ready for you in no time.
Yi'nian: Okay! Here's your Grilled Tiger Fish. What do you think?
Paimon: Mmm, delicious!
Traveler: Paimon's an expert in eating...
Paimon: Of course! What kind of a guide would Paimon be otherwise?
Yi'nian: Hahaha — well, hope you enjoy your food. I gotta see to some other customers.
Yi'nian: If you get hungry again, you know where I am!
Traveler: Paimon strikes again...

## Talk 8

Wang'ya: So you're back, what do you think? Yi'nian makes some mean grub, huh?
Paimon: Ahh, soooo tasty!
Traveler: He said he wouldn't look at the document...
Wang'ya: Oh yeah? ...He said that last year, too... If he'd listened to our marketing tips, he'd be doing even better by now.
Wang'ya: Anyway, not to worry. Here's the gift I was talking about. This Xiao Lantern is for you.
Paimon: Wow! Such a beautiful lantern! How is it made?
Wang'ya: Uh... I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to explain the process concisely.
Wang'ya: But if you're interested in Xiao Lanterns, you can ask <color=#00E1FFFF>Jingming</color> over there. He's in charge of both the Xiao and Mingxiao Lanterns.
Paimon: So he's responsible for the super-duper huge one too?
Wang'ya: That's right! He should be easy to find. Just over there, I think.
Paimon: If we could make a Xiao Lantern for Xiao... maybe that would cheer him up a bit!
Paimon: Let's find <color=#00E1FFFF>Jingming</color> and see what he has to say.

## Talk 9

Jingming: At this rate... we should be able to meet the deadline...
Traveler: Could you teach us how to make Xiao Lanterns?
Jingming: Teach you how to make Xiao Lanterns? Oh... you don't look like locals to me. Looking to try your hand at making your own?
Jingming: I'll be happy to teach you. There's no one way to make a Xiao Lantern, but let me start by showing you the simplest one.
Jingming: I should have some spare materials over here... Uh, just a second! Ah, they still need a bit of work. Take these, and give it a go.
Paimon: That was so complicated... Paimon is all out of brain juice. Did you get it?
Traveler: Just about...
Jingming: Hahaha, it all comes with practice. No one's expecting your first try to be perfect.
Jingming: Folks like you who want to learn my craft are a rare find nowadays...
Paimon: Did you build that humongous Mingxiao Lantern using this same method?
Jingming: That one? ...Hmm, I suppose it's fair to say the method is the same — broadly speaking. But no single person can take credit for it. The whole of Liyue comes together to make it.
Paimon: So it was a community effort?
Jingming: Surely you've heard about it? The Xiao Market is actually a fundraiser, aiming to support the Mingxiao Lantern's construction.
Paimon: Whoa... So that's how the Mingxiao Lantern is built...
Jingming: Such is the Lantern Rite tradition. The Ministry of Civil Affairs might be covering the bulk of the costs, but it's the citizens of Liyue that donate the materials, among many other things.
Paimon: Ohh... So that's what that little girl meant when she said she'd donated her rag doll.
Paimon: But since when do you build Mingxiao Lanterns out of rag dolls?
Jingming: Well, the Lantern Rite is a major festival. If somebody wants to make a contribution, no matter how small...
Jingming: ...Or in this case, symbolic, we tend not to reject them. All well-meaning contributions are gratefully received.
Jingming: Especially considering how grand of an occasion Lantern Rite is for everyone. People believe that joining the effort might bring them good luck.
Jingming: Heh, alrighty then. Shouldn't you get going? With all that the festival has to offer, I'm sure you must be on a busy schedule.
Jingming: Of course, if you want to make another Xiao Lantern at any time, you know where to find me.
Jingming: Happy Lantern Rite! Have fun!

## Talk 10

Wang'ya: So, did you find Jingming?
Paimon: We did, and he taught us all about how to make Xiao Lanterns!
Paimon: Even though Paimon can't really remember any of it...
Wang'ya: Hehe, no worries! You can always ask Jingming if you need to refresh your memory.
Wang'ya: I should go, duty calls! Happy Lantern Rite!
