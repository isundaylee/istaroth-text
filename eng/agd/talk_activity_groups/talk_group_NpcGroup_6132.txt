Tisoc: Ah, looks like the Mountain King Flamegranates have finally ripened up. What a relief!
Tisoc: Oh, it's you two! What's up? If you're planning on going in, be quick about it. Don't let anyone from the tribe see you!
Traveler: About the Mountain King...
Tisoc: Oh, you want to hear more about the Mountain King?
Tisoc: The Mountain King Kongamato is an extraordinary Saurian who once fought the Abyss, side-by-side with a legendary hero. Thus, he has the tribe's unanimous respect.
Tisoc: There are people whose job it is to pick and offer up these Flamegranates for the Mountain King's consumption. However, some say that in secret, other Yumkasaurs bring them to the Mountain King too...
Tisoc: Which is why the Mountain King is so much more, uhh... "Robustly built," shall we say?
Traveler: About the Flamegranates...
Tisoc: Well, you've certainly come to the right person. Flamegranates are phlogiston plants, and truly remarkable ones at that. The courage it must take for a plant to extend its roots down into liquid phlogiston... simply boggles the mind.
Tisoc: And the fruit they produce is full of phlogiston, so they make great food for Yumkasaurs... As long as they don't chuck them around, that is...
Tisoc: They do tend to explode on heavy impact, after all...
Traveler: Just passing through...
Tisoc: Oh, is that so? Sure you don't want to go in and take a look at the Mountain King Flamegranates... even just a little peek? I always feel much better after taking a good, long look at them... so if you ever feel troubled, I'd recommend you do the same.
