Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Frequent sightings of traces of beasts deep in the mountains and in the wilds have been reported, and miasma is present in many areas. The Communications Office sincerely reminds all visitors from abroad to avoid going too deep into the mountains and forests to avoid accidents.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): If you accidentally inhale the miasma and suffer from a headache or fever, do not panic. Rest well for a few days, and you should recover completely.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "The miasma is a disease that comes and goes imperceptibly. Eat and drink in moderation, follow a regular routine and rest suitably, and you will recover."
