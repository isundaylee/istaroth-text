Nilou: Since we have some rest time, you should make sure to give your body and mind a proper break. Remember the relaxation technique I taught you previously? You know, the one where you blow your sleepiness into a balloon?
Nilou: Huh...? Too much sleepiness for one balloon? Okay fine, you can use mine instead. Come on! Imagine there's a huge balloon in my hands. Take a deep breath, and blow!
Nilou: There you go! See, now doesn't that feel better?

## Talk 1

Nilou: In a funny way, what you're doing here in this domain reminds me of my dance practice at the Grand Bazaar.
Nilou: Maybe you dance with danger, and I dance for artistic reasons... But we both share the same desire to perform our best.
Nilou: Of course, this is your show. So in here... you lead, and I'll follow.

## Talk 2

Nilou: Ahh, warm lighting, fun stories to read... It's perfect. Oh, not that there's anything wrong with the House of Daena, of course.
Nilou: It's just that... The books there are pretty tough-going, and I tend to get so sleepy reading them that no amount of balloons can help me. And then I usually start getting hungry...
Nilou: I think... Maybe the fairytales here are more my kind of thing.
