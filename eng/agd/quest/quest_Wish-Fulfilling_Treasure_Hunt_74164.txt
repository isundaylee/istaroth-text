# Wish-Fulfilling Treasure Hunt


## Talk 1

Nadia: Urville, the Ball Octopuses' eyes just lit up. Why is that?
Urville: Because they are envious of my physical constitution. I'll be able to join the Fleet if I keep my training up. They don't even have a chance.

## Talk 2

Urville: Treasure... where could it be? In a chest? In a cabinet? Or tucked away in some hidden compartment?

## Talk 3

Nadia: I'm sorry, I can't remember what the treasure is. If only I could remember... then I'd be able to help out more.

## Talk 4

Precious Chest: (It's a chest that looks like private property. Best not to touch it...)

## Talk 5

Paimon: This is the place. Now, we need to find *Nadia's token and Urville's equipment — his diving set, coin pouch, and something like a tripod*...
Paimon: Oh. But what does Nadia's token look like?
Nadia: It's a tiny cog.
Paimon: Huh...? We need to find a tiny cog in the vast ocean? But there might be all sorts of unrelated components sitting at the bottom of the ocean...
Nadia: It's fine. My eyesight is great. I'd be able to remember as soon as I see it.

## Talk 6

Nadia: There are many Ball Octopuses around. The Ball Octopuses here and Urville are very alike.
Paimon: Why do you say that?
Nadia: Well... Because they all tend to act tough to try to intimidate their opponents. And, that they all like to collect shiny treasures.
Nadia: The Ball Octopuses might've hidden our stuff inside the shells...

## Talk 7

Nadia: #Got it! There's no way I'd have been able to get it back by myself... Thank you, Traveler.

## Talk 8

Paimon: That must be the tripod all tangled up there... There should be a way to get it out, right?

## Talk 9

Urville (???): ...What are you looking at? Never seen an adventurer before?
Paimon: Well, what a coincidence. We're adventurers ourselves. What are you doing here?
Nadia (???): We're looking for the treasure left behind by the Liliacruces Forum. It's gonna make us rich, Urville said so.
Urville (???): #Hey! Why are you telling them about it?
Nadia (???): Oh... In that case, no, we are definitely not looking for the treasure left behind by the Liliacruces Forum!
Traveler: Thank you for informing us of the situation.
Urville (???): Darn... Well, even if you know, we were still here first. We'll definitely take the lead...

## Talk 10

Nadia: I see! Ball Octopuses' eyes brighten up when they see your physique. But why, then, would you join the Fleet?
Urville: Because rumor has it that sailors make big bucks. It'll bring a much more stable income than what we're doing, trying to find some secret treasure...
Paimon: Hey there. What are you two doing here?
Nadia: Urville's doing physical training to join the Fleet... Joining the Fleet earns big bucks...
Urville: Nadia, I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut...
Nadia: I'm sorry. I forgot again.
Nadia: Hello, strangers. Urville is preoccupied with very important work, which is confidential, by the way. So, please leave us alone and keep your questions to yourselves.
Paimon: Uhh... But we...
Urville: Sorry, she suffered cranial damage previously, and she's kept on forgetting things since. What she says is not very coherent...
Urville: #Right. Nadia, head back to shore with them and rest a bit at The Rusty Rudder.
Paimon: What about you? You don't look so good... Have you been...
Nadia: That's not the case. Training is tough. Urville has to complete all the training courses in order to join the Fontaine Fleet.
Urville: Ah, you know me so well, Nadia. Now, hurry up and go.
Traveler: Good luck with your training, then. We're off.
Paimon: Hey, let's not leave him here like that! Paimon feels he's just too embarrassed to ask for our help... You see, asking someone for help when you're in trouble isn't something to be ashamed of at all.
Urville: I—I told you I'm fine. Don't believe me? How about I do some push-ups right now?!
Paimon: Wait, stop moving, you'll flip the wooden planks!
Traveler: Stop trying to act tough when you don't even have an oar left.
Paimon: That's right. Asking help from passing adventurers when you're in trouble is not something to be ashamed of.

## Talk 11

Urville: You want to check on how we're progressing? I'm not telling you a word.

## Talk 12

Nadia: Sorry... but we are not looking for the treasure left behind by the Liliacruces Forum.

## Talk 13

Urville: Nadia's token is the most important thing, followed by my diving set... As long as I have it, I can dive. It's not to say that everything else is not important, it's just that...
Urville: The coin pouch... I—I do want to repay you for your troubles... But it's so little that I don't think you'd care for it...

## Talk 14

Urville: Nervous? I'm hardly nervous at all!
Urville: ...
Urville: How's my hair? How do I look? I'm not gonna embarrass myself by leaving something humiliating behind again, am I?

## Talk 15

Nadia: Found it! That's my token.
Paimon: You really found it? It looks like just any other cog... Paimon can't tell the difference.
Nadia: You can if you're a Melusine. I'm not quite sure why, so I'm afraid I can't teach you how, sorry.
Paimon: Hey, there's no need to apologize...

## Talk 16

Paimon: So many Ball Octopuses! And Mora, too! Can we keep them? Can we?
Nadia: Would the Ball Octopuses agree?

## Talk 17

Investigate: (It takes you some effort to open the chest, but inside, there is only dust and powdery remains of... whatever the chest used to hold. Better not think about it.)

## Talk 18

Investigate: (By looking upwards to the point where your neck cannot bend back any further, you finally manage to make out some books that look interesting, but they have nothing to do with research whatsoever.)
Investigate: (There are some yellowed blank sheets of paper and numerous empty ink bottles in the drawer.)

## Talk 19

Investigate: (There seems to be something beneath the laid out sheet music...)
Paimon: What is this? The handwriting is barely legible... almost like a child wrote it... How strange, what it says seems oddly familiar... Could this be a coincidence?

## Talk 20

Nadia: #Traveler, Paimon, you're so kind... just like Urville.

## Talk 21

Paimon: And what's this...
Nadia: I'm sorry. I can't remember. Maybe it's something we've lost. Maybe not.
Paimon: Let's take it for now. Maybe we'll find some use for it!

## Talk 22

Paimon: That took quite a long time... We're more or less finished here. Shall we go back to The Rusty Rudder?

## Talk 23

Paimon: That's the Ball Octopuses from before! Are they chasing us because we stole from them?
Urville: #Traveler! I charge you with the mission of defeating my arch-nemesis!
Paimon: Hey!

## Talk 24

Paimon: No sign of any treasure... Let's see if Urville has had any luck.
