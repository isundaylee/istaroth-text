Oogura (???): Are you the Jibashiri they've sent to release us?
Oogura (???): Nah, you're too young, must be an apprentice or something.
Oogura (???): Pfah, but you know what? I'm not shocked. I'll bet those high-and-mighty Jibashiri couldn't stand the loss of face from accusing three innocent people, so they sent some youngster down to do their dirty work and apologize in their stead. Isn't that right?
Paimon: Are you the people who've been suspected of stealing "Before Sun and Moon"?
Oogura: What "suspect"? The name's Oogura, and we were falsely accused, alright?
Oogura: But never mind that. You're not here to let us out, are you? Well, if not that, I suppose you're after that guy?
Paimon: "That guy"?
Oogura: The third guy! I don't know him well, but the fellow next to me does — just a bit, but it counts! Go on, ask him.
Oogura: The guy who escaped is a rather fierce character. But I can guarantee that he, like the two of us here, is innocent.
Oogura: I mean, come on, it's Enkanomiya's last day. Let's not endanger human lives now, shall we?

Paimon: What in the world are you talking about?
Oogura: You're not officials? ...Well, this is troublesome. They can't have forgotten all about us, have they?
Oogura: My name is Oogura. I was falsely accused and locked up in this place — all three of us were, really!
Oogura: Well, not all hope is lost just yet. Since you were able to make it in here, you must be pretty capable yourself. Go save that guy, would you?
Paimon: That guy?
