# Where Is the Unseen Razor?


## Talk 1

Lan: Useless... Utterly useless.
Traveler: What's wrong?
Lan: ...You really don't have anything to do, do you? Either you're too good at what you do, or hopelessly inadequate...
Lan: I doubt it's the latter though — you've been doing a fine job with my Commissions so far.
Lan: If you're at a loose end, there is something else you could do for me.
Lan: But this time things are more dangerous. I need you to defeat a Ruin Hunter. Think you can handle it?
Traveler: Consider it done.
Lan: My, you are self-assured. My brother was the same way... Perhaps you will one day achieve the heights of greatness that he did.
Lan: That's all. The location is Guili Plains. Get yourself ready, then go and take down that Ruin Hunter.
Lan: Once you've taken him down, remember to look around for sword-related items; anything you find, bring it back.
Lan: ...But if there's nothing, just bring yourself.
Lan: Good luck with the Commission, and... I hope this time the search will prove more fruitful.
Traveler: Should I keep an eye out for a sword?
Lan: Yes please. When you've defeated the Ruin Hunter, please check around for a sword or any sword-related items.
Lan: I must warn you that Ruin Hunters are tough opponents. You must keep your attention fixed on them at all times if you wish to defeat them.
Lan: And as for the sword — it would be wonderful if you found something, but not to worry if you don't. You will be paid as long as you defeat the Ruin Hunter.

## Talk 2

Lan: Has the Ruin Hunter been dealt with?
Traveler: Not yet.
Lan: Well, take your time. One must be fully prepared before taking on a Ruin Hunter.

## Talk 3

Lan: Has the Ruin Hunter been dealt with?
Traveler: Yes.
Lan: Ruin Hunters are all in a day's work for you, eh... If I ever had any doubt in your capabilities, it is now gone.
Lan: ...Still nothing on the sword? *sigh* I'm beginning to loathe the sound of my voice asking that question.
Lan: Not to worry. I've thrown a mixed bag of Commissions at you, and each time you complete them dutifully. So thank you for that.
Lan: Unseen Razor, where are you hiding...
Traveler: You'll find it eventually.
Lan: ...Are you trying to make me feel better? Thanks, but this is barely a minor setback.
Lan: No matter how long it takes, and where this search takes me... I will find that sword.
Lan: I plan to keep widening the search area, so I may well call for your help again in future — and yes, I will continue to pay you for your services.
Lan: Here is your payment. I should go, there is a new list of Commissions waiting for me to vet.
Lan: Unseen Razor... You won't stay unseen forever...
Traveler: These Commissions don't seem sword-related at all.
Lan: That is because I already took on every single Commission that had anything at all to do with a sword. Sadly, they led me nowhere.
Lan: So then I thought... Surely, whatever happened to separate my brother from his sword, it can only have been under highly dangerous circumstances.
Lan: So I started accepting other Commissions — ones I thought just might be dangerous enough to give me a lead on the whereabouts of Unseen Razor.
Lan: However, there are slightly too many dangerous Commissions for me to handle on my own. That is why I started asking you to help.
