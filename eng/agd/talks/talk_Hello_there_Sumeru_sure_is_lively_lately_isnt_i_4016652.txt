Araby: Hello there. Sumeru sure is lively lately, isn't it?
Araby: Though I'd love to just calmly observe the sea, the sounds of merriment and celebration sometimes drown out the waves.
Araby: But now we must be more vigilant. What if some giant sea monster wants to come celebrate the Dendro Archon's birthday too, but accidentally knocks the lighthouse over?
Araby: I've got to be ready to remind it to watch its step, haha!
Araby: ...Um, don't take it seriously! I'm just joking!
