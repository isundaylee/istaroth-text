Traveler: But I can't stop here.
Nakano: Ahh, it seems like you still have unfulfilled wishes, young Traveler.
Nakano: Well... It's good that you have aspirations that drive you.
Nakano: This bow was given to me by a friend when I was still young... However, I've never had the chance to use it.
Nakano: I don't think it'll do me any good, so I'll give it to you. If it can help you in your journey, then it has served its purpose.
