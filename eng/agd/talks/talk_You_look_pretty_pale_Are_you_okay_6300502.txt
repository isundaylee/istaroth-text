Traveler: You look pretty pale. Are you okay?
Furuya Noboru: It's okay. I was just born with a weak constitution. *cough* Thank you for asking.
Furuya Noboru: I have been weak and prone to sickness since I was little. I joined the Adventurers' Guild after I had grown up, hoping to train my body through adventures.
Furuya Noboru: Although I have gathered quite a lot of experience, my body still remains the same... Oh, no no... I'm not some great adventurer worth mentioning or anything.
Furuya Noboru: However, because I have been in Inazuma for so long, I happen to know more about the local Adventurers' Guild than anyone else. *cough* If you have any questions, feel free to ask me anytime.
