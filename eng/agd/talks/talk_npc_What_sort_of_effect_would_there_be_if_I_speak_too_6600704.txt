Traveler: What sort of effect would there be if I speak too loud?
Bounama: That's a very good question.
Bounama: Many people overlook environmental factors when they're making things, so the fact that you even thought of asking shows that you're well ahead of the game.

Bounama: So why don't they seem to understand that sound too can have an effect when crafting materials?
