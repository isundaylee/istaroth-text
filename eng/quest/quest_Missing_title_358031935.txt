## Talk 1

Takashi: Whoa there, wait a second. You can't just open these chests as you please.
Traveler: Are these your chests?
Takashi: Of course. I placed them here specially.
Takashi: They're filled with all kinds of treasures, carefully gathered by me.
Takashi: If you want to open them, that can be arranged... However, first, you have to give me something in exchange.
Traveler: You want Mora?
Takashi: Hahaha, actually, I don't want any Mora.
Takashi: What I want is a kind of conch.
Takashi: You should be able to find plenty of them around the beach.
Takashi: If you want to open the treasure chests and get your hands on what's inside, bring me some of those conches in exchange.
Takashi: But... I'm not going to tell you what's inside. What treasures you end up with will come down to how lucky you are.
Takashi: What do you think? If you want to open these treasure chests, just hand me some conches.
Traveler: What would you like, then?
Traveler: What's inside?

## Talk 2

Takashi: Hmm? Is something the matter?

## Talk 3

Traveler: I want to open a chest.
Takashi: As long as you've got some conches for me, you're free to take your pick.

## Talk 4

Traveler: What are you collecting these conches for?
Takashi: Hehehe, well... to do some business, of course.
Takashi: "Conches that were once influenced by Tatarigami"... Hahaha, they're sure to fetch a good price!
Takashi: Ahem! Anyway, you provide me with conches, I provide you with chests. Got it?

## Talk 5

Traveler: This house looks familiar...
Takashi: Is that so? Wow...that's quite a coincidence, hahaha.
Takashi: But even if the house looks the same, the business I do here is unique.

## Talk 6

Takashi: Hmm? Are you a traveler? Haha, you've come at a good time. I have some good news for you.
Traveler: Does it involve these treasure chests?
Takashi: That's right, it's the treasure chests.
Takashi: They're filled with all kinds of treasures, carefully gathered by me.
Takashi: For just a little something in return, you can open the chests and get your hands on the treasures inside.
Traveler: You want Mora?
Takashi: Hahaha, actually, I don't want any Mora.
Takashi: What I want is a kind of conch.
Takashi: You should be able to find plenty of them around the beach.
Takashi: If you want to open the treasure chests and get your hands on what's inside, bring me some of those conches in exchange.
Takashi: But... I'm not going to tell you what's inside. What treasures you end up with will come down to how lucky you are.
Takashi: What do you think? If you want to open these treasure chests, just hand me some conches.
Traveler: What would you like, then?

## Talk 7

Takashi: How's it going? Have you got some conches for me?

## Talk 8

Takashi: Nice one! These are just the kind of conches I wanted. Go ahead, pick a treasure chest and open it.
Traveler: ...Only one chest?
Takashi: Sorry, these chests are one at a time, I'm afraid.
Takashi: Okay, go ahead and take your pick. Best of luck, hehe.
Traveler: Can't I open all of them?

## Talk 9

Takashi: I take it you've opened one of the chests? Hahaha, I hope you got lucky.
Traveler: So you're collecting these conches?
Takashi: Bingo. Yes, I am collecting them.
Takashi: But I can't tell you why for now.
Traveler: Is there something special about them?
Takashi: From a business point of view, there most certainly is.
Takashi: "Conches that were once influenced by Tatarigami"... Hahaha, they're sure to fetch a good price!
Takashi: Ahem! Anyway, you provide me with conches, I provide you with chests. Got it?
Takashi: Anyway, that's your opportunity this time around used up.
Takashi: If you want to open another treasure chest, come back with some more conches later on.
Traveler: You're so suspicious...
Takashi: They're just conches for goodness' sake. Don't be so paranoid.

## Talk 10

Takashi: Go pick a treasure chest and open it. I wish you the best of luck.

## Talk 11

Traveler: Goodbye.
Takashi: Bye for now, then. Don't forget: conches for chests, conches for chests, hahaha.
