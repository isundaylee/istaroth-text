Traveler: Budget?
Shatir: Yeah, the budgets.
Shatir: Sadly, even great things like knowledge can be thwarted by money.
Shatir: The Akademiya has been spending more and more budgets on classified research over the past years.
Shatir: Instead of maintaining a financial black hole, they should fund more practical disciplines like archaeology.
Shatir: With a lack of self-reflection on history, we would get a short end in real life sooner or later.
Shatir: Next time I apply for funding, I must get Vikram to join me!

Traveler: I've only heard the name.
Shatir: What? You don't know about him? Hm... Well, he has been busy recently with the thing about the next Grand Conservator.
Shatir: I don't know what other people think, but other than Lisa, who according to legends has become Mondstadt's Grand Conservator, Vikram should be the most suitable candidate.
Shatir: After all, if the person in charge of the collections is as unreasonable as the one managing the funds, this study will be dead in the water.
