## Talk

Muning: How is everything down there? Did you encounter any danger?

## Talk

Traveler: (Describe your experiences to Muning.)
Muning: Ah, I see. That does sound rather dangerous. I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to help take care of Jinwu and Zhiqiong, then.

## Talk

Traveler: Aren't you supposed to stop me?
Muning: Well, that is my duty, yes. But you always run off too quickly for me to stop you, so I can't.

## Talk

Traveler: All goes well, don't you fret.
Muning: That's good, that's good. As long as things go well, the Qixing will have no reason to come down too hard on me...

## Talk

Traveler: I don't run that fast.
Muning: No, you do. That's what the report says, and what the report says is the truth.

## Talk

Traveler: Alright, guess I'm really, really fast, then.
Muning: Exactly. As such, please do be careful.

## Talk

Muning: Resumption of work for the miners and provisions for their food, the changing of Millelith guards, contract signings, equipment overhauls, and weekly reports...
Muning: Ah, it's you. Do you need me to help with anything else? I mean, I am a bit... busy, right now, but...

## Talk

Traveler: You're that busy, huh?
Muning: You bet. There's so much work to be done that I reckon that I'll start losing hair over it soon.
Muning: But there's nothing for it: the resumption of work at The Chasm is good for Liyue as a whole, of that there is no doubt. But the deluge of work will always have to be taken up by an unfortunate few.
Muning: Still, you have my thanks. Things are busy here, sure, but it's much improved from how things were when it was just Zhiqiong and a couple others.

## Talk

Traveler: I don't need help at the moment.
Muning: Phew. Well, that's good.
Muning: Not that I don't want to help you, obviously, but I'm just... a bit swamped at the moment.
Muning: The Feiyun Commerce Guild's representative just left, and now we need to send people to put up recruitment notices for miners.
Muning: Once we're done here, I'm gonna apply for some leave.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Muning: See you. Again, the Ministry of Civil Affairs thanks you for your efforts.

## Talk

Traveler: How's Zhiqiong...
Muning: Ah yes. About Zhiqiong, the Millelith should have received news about her. If nothing goes awry, the search-and-rescue team from the Ministry should also arrive soon.
Muning: We should have news of her shortly.
Muning: That said, she's so fond of adventure that she probably went gallivanting somewhere by herself. *cough* If you meet her out there, please be sure to tell me.
Muning: I'm sure you must be much busier than me, but you know, it would be nice if you could look out for her on my behalf...

## Talk

Traveler: I will.
Muning: Thank you. I look forward to hearing from you.

## Talk

Traveler: What's the situation with Zhiqiong?
Muning: The search-and-rescue team hasn't had news of her yet. But please don't panic... This isn't the time to panic just yet.
Muning: We should have news of her shortly.
Muning: As for me, I believe that she's still alive. Adventurers are a tough lot, so she shouldn't... Um, sorry...
Muning: *cough* But if you do meet her out there, please be sure to tell me.

## Talk

Muning: May I ask for your name?
Traveler: Why, hello there...
Muning: My apologies, but The Chasm has been closed indefinitely. We do not take guests here.
Muning: Unless...
Traveler: Unless...?
Muning: Unless you can get permission from Yujing Terrace... Or if you are on a *special commission*.
Muning: However, things have been quite unusual lately, and our bosses have been most busy... I'd advise that you mind your own business, lest you disturb them.
Muning: Please leave at once. This is for your own safety.
Traveler: I'm...

## Talk

Traveler: You still owe Lan Mora for drinks. Don't you forget that.
Muning: Eh? Oh, so that's what you're here for? Hmph... Alright, alright. These adventurers... Can't ever trust them to come out and speak their minds.
Muning: Alright, then. If you have any questions, ask away. I will answer them — provided that I know the answer.

## Talk

Traveler: Here's the Mora that Xingqiu said he'd lend you.
Muning: Oh my! As expected of Liyue's great hero — coming in the nick of time to my aid!
Muning: *cough* Uh, I mean, considering your long-term partnership with the Ministry of Civil Affairs, just ask me any questions you might have.

## Talk

Muning: Missing text (3216452594)
Muning: Missing text (10431122)

## Talk

Traveler: Could you tell me more about The Chasm?
Muning: Right, so about the Chasm... If you don't intend to leave just yet, you're free to explore the area a bit. But please do keep your actions within the remit of Liyue's laws and statutes.
Muning: I should mention, though, that there is a place that I highly recommend you avoid.
Muning: For example, the great mine in the center of The Chasm has had a Seven-Star Array cast over it... By which I mean exactly what I say — it is a seal placed over the area by the Qixing.
Traveler: Well, that's quite the clear explanation.
Muning: As for the weak... I mean, focal point of the array, it lies in the Bedrock Keys surrounding the area. These were placed by the Qixing themselves. Connected in series, they affix the energy flowing through the array.
Muning: The area around the Bedrock Keys has seen an abnormal amount of Geo elemental coalescences. It's almost as if the "thing" beneath yearns to finally emerge...
Muning: ...Uh, never mind me, I was just talking to myself. So yes, that's how things are. Please do not — and I repeat, do not — go near the Seven-Star Array, and don't even think about going down there to explore.
Muning: The Bedrock Keys are definitely not losing structural integrity, and the surrounding areas are most certainly not plagued by any strange Geo elemental convergences. So please, don't you think of doing anything at all.
Traveler: But...
Muning: Hmph, I know what you're going to ask.
Muning: There are most certainly no precious treasures down there, nor are there any prehistoric fossils to be had. And banish any thoughts you have about giant ancient ruins... Yes, please do not bear any fruitless expectations toward this place.
Paimon: The way you're saying all this is super suspicious!
Muning: Not even mushrooms will grow down there! Nor are there wish-granting stones! And there are definitely no sailors who grow strong just by eating mushrooms! Again, do not get your hopes up!
Paimon: Uh, yeah, sure! There's no need to be so fierce...
Traveler: Anything else I should look out for?
Muning: I suggest that you go speak to Zhiqiong first. She is an adventurer hired by the Ministry and was once a miner here. She knows The Chasm's geography like the back of her hand...
Muning: Also, let me write you a certification real quick. When she sees it, she'll know that you're trustworthy.
Muning: That said, I must warn you that Zhiqiong is definitely not the sort of person who has trouble standing still, and definitely has no thoughts of undoing the array and having a look underground.
Muning: So there's no way that she would ever put a team of idle adventurers together to brazenly enter hazardous areas! As such, you can forget about asking her to help you enter The Chasm's mines.
Traveler: Uh huh. Got it.
Muning: Did... did you really?
Muning: As long as you understand, we're good, in which case, I won't take up any more of your time.
Traveler: Uh... yeah, I got it.
Traveler: Got it, then. Come, Paimon, let's go.
Paimon: Yup, let's go!
Muning: Wait! I haven't finished!

## Talk

Muning: Ten crates of meat, ten crates of vegetables, various amounts of firewood and camping equipment to be given to the Millelith outpost... Three crates of various ores to be sent to the Huishan Hall warehouse in exchange for spare parts for tools... in various amounts...
Muning: Alright, sorry for making you wait. What do you need... Ah, it's you!
Paimon: Eh? Since when were we all that familiar with you...?
Muning: I mean, you are the heroes who saved Liyue. Your deeds are remembered by us all.
Muning: Since you're here at The Chasm, you must be here on some important business. In which case, I'm sure you must have a permit from Lady Keqing, right?
Paimon: Uh...
Traveler: We don't.
Muning: Really? I mean, sorry to trouble you... Since you must be very familiar with Lady Ningguang, a permit from her might hold still more weight. Could I see it, please?
Paimon: Hehe...
Traveler: Well, we don't have that, either.
Muning: Well, the Lord Tianshu is reclusive yet approachable, and also has great vision and the good of the people at heart. Surely he was the one who gave you permission to enter the Chasm, then?
Paimon: May... maybe?
Muning: In that case, would you mind letting me see your papers?
Traveler: ...
Muning: Huh, I guess you don't have that, either. Well, Ms. Ganyu works at Yujing Terrace, supporting the Qixing directly, so I'm sure her opinion would be in lockstep with theirs. You at least have her permission, don't you?
Paimon: (Actually, you know what? We could have just asked Ganyu to sign off on this!)
Traveler: I can, uh, go look for her right now...
Muning: ...
Paimon: ...
Traveler: ...
Muning: *sigh* ...
Muning: So... you've come at a bad time. This is really not the season to be visiting The Chasm. The Ministry of Civil Affairs is still working on eliminating a great safety hazard within, so this is still very much a danger zone.
Muning: If you have been commissioned by some merchant to urge us to open the mine faster, then I suggest you read the report I submitted to Shenglu Hall carefully.
Paimon: Uh, what's this person talking about, exactly?

## Talk

Traveler: So, about Lan...
Muning: Ah, did she tell you about some "special commission"? Well, I am the representative of the Ministry in this place, and as far as they are concerned, any commissions from the Adventurers' Guild hold no weight here.
Muning: So you can't... I mean, don't you also try using her to put pressure on me. It won't work...
Paimon: Pfft. That wasn't convincing at all!
Traveler: I mean, you do owe her money for liquor...
Muning: Alright! Alright! Can we change the topic, please? Let's get back down to business!
Traveler: "Also"? I take it that someone's done this to you before?

## Talk

Traveler: So, about Xu...
Muning: I've been friends with the two young masters of the family he serves for a long time. The younger of them, Xingqiu, is a warm-hearted and chivalrous soul for someone of his age. I was definitely right to put my faith in him.
Muning: Of course, I also have you and Xu to thank in this case... *sigh* If this sum hadn't come in this month, I'd have some trouble making ends meet before my next payday.
Muning: Either way, I can now start worrying about next month's expenditures.
Paimon: Man, how much Mora does this guy owe...
Muning: Heh, well, old habits die hard, you know?
Muning: But to be honest, I haven't had the time to go to Yanshang Teahouse in a long while Not since I got assigned here, anyway.
Muning: It's just that old debts still need paying, you know? I... guess I'll have to trouble all of you in the future as well.
Traveler: You should probably manage your finances better.
Muning: *sigh* You're right. I suppose I just don't consider these things enough.
Traveler: You shouldn't waste the goodwill of your friends.

## Talk

Muning: What happened? He was absent this morning during the headcount. Where on earth is he?
Muning: If the higher-ups find out... I'd be toast.
Muning: Ah, you're here. Good timing...
Paimon: What happened? Why are you sighing?
Muning: *sigh* To tell you the truth, a miner from our camp went missing.
Muning: The Chasm has a complex environment. Though things have stabilized a bit lately, it's still dangerous deep inside. So, we made it a rule to take a headcount every morning and evening.
Muning: Qi Ding — the guy who never misses a chance to brag about his daughter — was absent last night.
Muning: During the headcount, other miners said that they had just met him and that he might return very soon. So I let it go.
Muning: But this morning, he was still nowhere to be found. Other miners looked evasive, so I pressed them for an honest answer. It turned out that Qi Ding hadn't returned the whole night...
Muning: Now we're in big trouble. Don't tell me it's happening again...
Traveler: What is happening again?
Muning: *sigh* This is something that only Ministry personnel should know.
Muning: But since you're the hero who saved Liyue, I think I can make an exception for you.
Muning: This was before The Chasm was sealed... At first, it was just a strange rumor among miners that something in The Chasm could "make their wish come true."
Muning: We had warned them to report to Huishan Hall should they encounter anything unusual.
Muning: Yet some miners tried their luck — They went looking for "The Chasm's Bounty" in secret and ended up going missing one by one.
Muning: When we found them some while later, they'd all gone pretty insane. It took quite some time for them to recover. That was creepy. After the incident, the Qixing decided to seal The Chasm.
Paimon: Could the missing miner be...
Muning: Yes, I suspect Qi Ding got himself into the same situation.
Muning: Should anything happen to him, I'll definitely lose my job. *sigh* What's more, his wife passed away many years ago, and his daughter is now an intern at the Ministry of Civil Affairs. If we can't find him...
Muning: #*sigh* Traveler, I'm gonna have people put up some missing person posters, but can you help me look for him...
Traveler: Sure.
Muning: Mm, let me think if there's anything noticeable about him. He used to be on the demolitions team, there's always a strong gunpowder smell on him... Hope you find this useful.
Muning: #*sigh* Qi Ding, I warned you not to go down. You aren't like Traveler...
Traveler: Has something similar happened before?
