# Business in a Marsh


## Talk 1

Huai'an: This is becoming an absolute nightmare...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Huai'an: I haven't slept properly in days... See the dark circles under my eyes?
Huai'an: Have you met any of the guests? They're a handful, to say the least. A brand-new crisis with each one. One of them actually jumped from the top of the building. A building this high. What were they thinking!?
Huai'an: But never mind that. Right now, I'm waiting on a food delivery from the city, it should be here soon.
Huai'an: There are monsters on the road though, and they're sure to stir up trouble. Could I trouble you to get rid of them for me?
Traveler: Okay.
Huai'an: Thanks.
Traveler: It's like this place is cursed...
Huai'an: Well... When your doors are open to travelers from all over the world, expect a world's worth of baggage... That's what I like to say.
Huai'an: We can manage though. It's just an inn that's a bit further out and a bit busier than most.
Huai'an: I appreciate your help. Thanks, and good luck.

## Talk 2

Huai'an: How's it coming along? All clear?
Traveler: Not yet.
Huai'an: Okay, please be as quick as you can. The chef has run out of supplies.
Huai'an: I could go and sort it myself if it came to it, but that's a last resort.

## Talk 3

Huai'an: How's it coming along? All clear?
Traveler: All clear.
Huai'an: Great. Thanks a lot.
Huai'an: Here's your payment. If you're ever in the area again, feel free to stop by anytime.
