Clorinde: Now that I think of it, the Maison Cardinalice set up an archive room to store information related to duels.
Clorinde: A complete case file would include the cause of the duel, the verdict rendered, the persons and duelists involved, and of course, the final outcome of the duel.
Clorinde: I've never felt the need to look up anything there myself. I believe all my duelist colleagues feel the same way. It's best to leave the recordkeeping to the Gestionnaires â€” they seem to actually enjoy that kind of work.
