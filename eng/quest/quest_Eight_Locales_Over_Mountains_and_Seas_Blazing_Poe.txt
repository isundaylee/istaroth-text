# Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas: Blazing Poetry


## Talk 1

Paimon: This is a super special view, isn't it?
"Kichiboushi": So much water, super special colors, mm!
Traveler: You two sound like you could be siblings.
Paimon: #But it is very special, isn't it? How would you describe it, Traveler?
Traveler: Like Cryo...
Paimon: What's that even supposed to mean?
Paimon: #But this place really is special. Traveler, do you still remember that artist from before?
Traveler: Vermeer, you mean?
Paimon: That's right! That's him! Didn't we help him place those glowing pearls into two giant statues?
Paimon: He even gave us a painting afterward!
Traveler: Is this what you're looking for?
Paimon: It should be... here! Come have a look, Kichiboushi!
"Kichiboushi": Mm! Very alike! Is it photo?
Paimon: No, someone drew this.
"Kichiboushi": Eh? But... if people have photo, why drawing?
Paimon: #Huh. Actually, why is that, Traveler?
Traveler: I suppose people have a desire to make something that is uniquely theirs.
Paimon: Huh, that sounds reasonable.
Traveler: Something that you draw yourself has much more sentimental value.
Paimon: That's true, drawing something out brushstroke by brushstroke is pretty hard!
"Kichiboushi": Mm... Then is taking photos of me easy, not-hard, and not-sentimental?
Paimon: Eh!? N—No, that's not it, we just...
Traveler: Drawing takes a long time, you know. It's pretty tiring.
Paimon: That's right! If we spend too long drawing, your legs might fall asleep on you from all that standing still.
"Kichiboushi": When I was sealed in stone, always standing.
"Kichiboushi": So when freed from seal, a long time later, legs very sore.
Paimon: Ergh, that sounds very painful...
"Kichiboushi": But Paimon can flip-flap. Legs won't be sore.
Paimon: Hey now! Floating's a full-body exercise. It's super tiring!
"Kichiboushi": Ooh, fire flower!
Paimon: Hey, are you listening, or what?
Traveler: A Flaming Flower, you mean?
Paimon: That's true, Chinju Forest doesn't have any Flaming Flowers at all...
Paimon: Do you want one, Kichiboushi?
"Kichiboushi": Yes! Looks very warming.
Paimon: #Then you'd better ask Traveler nicely!
"Kichiboushi": #Traveler, wants! Thank you.
Paimon: Do all bake-danuki talk like this...
Traveler: Kameras are pretty expensive, you know.
Paimon: Eh!? Are they? Then don't we risk breaking ours by bringing it into battle, to climb mountains, swim, and such?
Paimon: Um... So, be more careful next time, okay?
Traveler: Sorry, who now?
Paimon: Vermeer! Don't you remember the time we helped him place those glowing pearls into two giant statues?
Traveler: Like Anemo?
Traveler: Ah, the two of you possess such splendid vocabularies.
"Kichiboushi": Mm, splendid, like Paimon!
Paimon: #Uh, Paimon doesn't think that's what Traveler means... But whatever! That's a clever boy, Kichiboushi!
Traveler: A super special view!
Paimon: #Huh, aren't you using a couple of words too few, Traveler?

## Talk 2

"Kichiboushi": So much water, super special colors, mm!
Traveler: You two sound like you could be siblings.
Paimon: #But it is very special, isn't it? How would you describe it, Traveler?
Traveler: Like Cryo...
Paimon: What's that even supposed to mean?
Paimon: This place has a great view, though. Really makes Paimon wanna draw!
Traveler: You can draw, Paimon?
Paimon: Paimon can learn!
"Kichiboushi": Drawing... But drawing is very hard. Watched Utamarou draw. Took very long for one drawing.
"Kichiboushi": Why do people drawing when they have photo?
Paimon: #Huh. Actually, why is that, Traveler?
Traveler: I suppose people have a desire to make something that is uniquely theirs.
Paimon: Huh, that sounds reasonable.
Traveler: Something that you draw yourself has much more sentimental value.
Paimon: That's true, drawing something out brushstroke by brushstroke is pretty hard!

"Kichiboushi": Yes! Looks very warming.
Paimon: #Then you'd better ask Traveler nicely!
"Kichiboushi": #Traveler, wants! Thank you.
Paimon: ...He doesn't sound all that sincere. Or do bake-danuki just talk like that?
Traveler: Kameras are pretty expensive, you know.
Paimon: Eh!? Are they? Then don't we risk breaking ours by bringing it into battle, to climb mountains, swim, and such?
Paimon: Um... So, be more careful next time, okay?

## Talk 3

"Kichiboushi": #Traveler, want fire flower. Thanks.

## Talk 4

"Kichiboushi": So warm.
"Kichiboushi": If we had a Flaming Flower at Dragonspine, would be good!
Paimon: He's got a point. We should probably have gone better prepared...
"Kichiboushi": Paimon, if we had a very big flower, could we make the snowy mountain have no snow?
Paimon: P—Probably not...
"Kichiboushi": Mm.
Traveler: We could take Kichiboushi to see a "very big Flaming Flower."
Paimon: Eh? Wait, you mean...
Traveler: I mean the Pyro Regisvine, of course.
Paimon: Alright then, guess that's Kichiboushi's training for today!
Traveler: Let's get going.

## Talk 5

"Kichiboushi": So big! So hot! Amazing to have big fire flower!
Paimon: Right? Ooh, also...
Paimon: Hang on a moment, Kichiboushi. Let's take a photo of you!
Traveler: In this steaming hot place?
Paimon: That's the whole point!
"Kichiboushi": Mm... Okay...

## Talk 6

"Kichiboushi": Ooh.. So hot...
Paimon: Hehe, guess you know now, eh, Kichiboushi?
"Kichiboushi": Mm?
Traveler: Know what, Paimon?
Paimon: Can you imagine if we had to draw you?
Paimon: And that's why we chose to take photos instead! It's not that we don't care. It's precisely because we care about you that we decided to save time!
Traveler: Oh, so that's what you were intending to do.
"Kichiboushi": Understood. Photo, good. So... hot...
Traveler: Let's take the heat source out. The quicker, the better.
"Kichiboushi": Mmmm...
Traveler: Ridiculous...
Traveler: You're not wrong, but it's still way too hot in here...

## Talk 7

"Kichiboushi": #Traveler, so strong!
Traveler: I'm so-so.
"Kichiboushi": #Traveler and Paimon fight often?
Paimon: Come to think of it, the goal of our journey is to help you find your lost relative, but we always wind up in fights along the way.
Traveler: It's fine. I quite like fights.
Paimon: Well... That's nice and all, but there's better hobbies out there for sure, right?
"Kichiboushi": #When I become great bake-danuki, will become as strong as Traveler.
Paimon: You can do it for sure! But you've got to promise Paimon...
"Kichiboushi": Yes, Paimon?
Paimon: Well... Ahem! Even if you become a powerful bake-danuki like Ioroi, promise that you won't bully those weaker than you, or pick fights whenever you want!
Paimon: #Don't be like that big, fiery, flower that started spewing flames the moment it saw Traveler!
"Kichiboushi": Then when is fighting okay?
Traveler: When it's self-defense...
"Kichiboushi": Mm... Not really understanding, but I promise Paimon. No bullying weak people, no picking fights.
Paimon: That's a good boy, Kichiboushi!
Paimon: Next up... Huh, this should be the final stop out of the eight that Ioroi set down...
"Kichiboushi": Mm...
Traveler: When you need to protect others...
Traveler: When you need to stand up for what's right...
Traveler: Battles are bothersome, honestly.
Paimon: That's true, but sometimes we've just got no choice, eh?
Traveler: We've fought this sort of thing enough times by now.
