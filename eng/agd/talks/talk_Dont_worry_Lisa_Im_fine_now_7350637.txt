# Talk Dialog

Collei: Don't worry, Lisa. I'm fine now.
Traveler: Greetings.
Lisa: I came here to visit an old friend, but I had no idea that she'd already become a Trainee Forest Ranger.
Collei: Hehe, it's nothing, really. I just wanted to help out Master Tighnari.
Lisa: Well then, it seems my little Collei has been making some new friends in Sumeru.
Collei: And I've been doing my best to learn how to read. Now I can even read some simple sentences!
Collei: Master and everyone in Sumeru has taken good care of me, but I've never forgotten my friends in Mondstadt. I've actually been thinking about taking some time to go back for a visit.
Collei: Miss Lisa, how's everyone doing? Well, I hope? What about Amber? And Jean? Oh, and Kaeya...
Lisa: Haha, slow down, Collei. I'll tell you all about them...
Lisa: Sorry, darling, seems I'll need some time here. I want to tell Collei about what's happening in Mondstadt.
Traveler: And we meet again, Lisa.
