Razor: Sorry, not good at chat.

Traveler: No worries. I understand what you're trying to say.
Razor: Good... You are strong.
Razor: Okay, I try to... speak more.
Razor: ...
Razor: I like grass more than floor.
Razor: Floor is big, but hard. Grass is bigger... but it smells good.
Traveler: Here, you'd use "and"...
Razor: Oh! "AND..." it smells good.
Razor: I like your cooked meat. Better than raw meat.
Razor: Raw meat sometimes makes my stomach hurt. Your cooked meat, smells good... AND... tastes good.

Razor: My words... are they alright?
Traveler: "And" it smells good.
Traveler: I'll practice with you.
Razor: Practice? Thank you.
