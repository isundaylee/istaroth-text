# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Try treating them like little kittens or puppies.
Yareche: Hey, how did you know that? My teacher does the same.
Yareche: But even if I can imitate a cat's meowing, it's not like that'll help the cat figure out what I'm trying to say...
Yareche: Could it be that they can communicate with each other using only the tone of voice?
Yareche: Hmm, that's just like what happened when my teacher shouted at me for failing to stabilize my altitude during a flight! I couldn't hear what she was saying, but I sure could understand what she meant...
Yareche: Ah, sorry. There I go, talking to myself again.
Yareche: ...Hmm. Might it also be that talking to a Saurian is no different from talking to yourself?
