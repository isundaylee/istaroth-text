# Good Hunter Express


## Talk 1

Traveler: I've got other matters to settle right now.
Sara: Well, okay. I'll see who else I can get to take this commission.

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'll deliver it right now.
Sara: That would be great, thank you!
Sara: Make sure you stay safe. *Try not to get attacked by anything in the ruins, and remember not to run too fast*, or the dish might fall out.
Sara: Please hurry, this dish won't taste good if it gets cold.

## Talk 3

Hardworking Silio: I'm so hungry...

## Talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Sara: That's right. Silio ordered another serving of Mondstadt Grilled Fish today before heading to Stormterror's Lair. Could you help us and deliver this to him real quick?
Sara: This serving of Mondstadt Grilled Fish *can't come into contact with any strange elements*, or it might end up tasting funny.
