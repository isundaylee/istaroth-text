Ifa's Message: "I hope you all remember to perform regular health checkups on your Saurian companions. Like humans, they can be quite obstinate at times."
Ifa's Message: "If you feel as though something is off during your daily interactions with them, please come in for a check-up immediately. I will do my best to help in my capacity as a doctor, whether it be for you or your companion."
Ifa's Message: "Anyway, don't be pig-headed, alright? This applies to both humans and Saurians."
