Mualani: Rest well now, start well later, am I right? In my experience, a good night's sleep does way more for recovery than the finest meal...
Mualani: I've weighed up the surrounding area, our timing, and everyone's condition. My conclusion? It's time for a nap and some snacks.
Mualani: That's my suggestion as a guide from the "People of the Springs" — for your consideration.

## Talk 1

Mualani: The challenges this Domain poses are way different from the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, but we're winning this — that I'm sure of.
Mualani: After all, no matter what we face, "no one fights alone." That'll never change!
Mualani: Pre-departure rituals are important! Put your hand on mine, and say it with me: "Fight, fight, fight! Victory's in sight!"

Mualani: I just can't stop reading... So many different travelogs and chronicles of adventures, and they're all...so... fascinating!
Mualani: Some of the stuff in here is so blatantly over the top that even I can't help but wonder if it's made up...
Mualani: That settles it! As soon as I get the chance, I'll go see for myself! "Seeing is believing"! Right?
