Traveler: Can Melusines wear human clothes, though...
Flo: Well, of course not. Our bodies are very different â€” even beautiful clothes made for children wouldn't make good direct fits for us...
Flo: But whether we be human or Melusine, our feelings toward lovely clothes are one and the same, and so I wish to create such clothes that Melusines, too, can wear!
