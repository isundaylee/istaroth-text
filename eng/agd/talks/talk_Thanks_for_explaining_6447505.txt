Traveler: Thanks for explaining.
Betresa: Think nothing of it, Traveler. As I see it, you, too, represent many possibilities, and I am glad to have met you here.
Betresa: Lord Sethos, too, says that you are a friend to us and the Temple. Stay a while if you have time. I imagine all of us would be glad of it.
