# Wine, with a Taste of Freedom


## Talk 1

Degui: Business seems to be grinding to a halt...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Degui: I was just saying, business is getting tougher and tougher in this tavern of mine.
Degui: For us in the food and drink business, having a long history is both a blessing and a curse.
Degui: The good part is, a long history gives you more of a reputation, which helps bring in business.
Degui: The bad part is, people get bored of having the same thing over and over again. In big restaurants, where they have plenty of variety, that's obviously not a problem.
Degui: But my tavern is only a small one.
Degui: My long-term regulars are now finally starting to get bored with the drinks, and one by one they're leaving...
Degui: I've heard there's a big wine industry in Mondstadt. They have a famous Dandelion Wine, supposedly brewed with Dandelions.
Degui: I'm not even sure if brewing with Dandelions is possible... But I'd like to at least give it a try.
Degui: Could you go to Mondstadt and fetch some Dandelions for me?
Traveler: Okay.
Degui: Great. You have my word I will pay you for your trouble. And in Liyue, our word is our bond.
Traveler: Dandelion wine?
Degui: You think it's a strange flavor? That may be, but I've heard it's extremely popular in Mondstadt.
Degui: Although, it's not going to sell if I just copy the exact same recipe...
Degui: Anyway, start by bringing me some *Dandelions*, and in the meantime, I will think about how to add a little Liyue touch to the brewing process.

## Talk 2

Degui: Did you find any *Dandelions*?

## Talk 3

Degui: I will experiment a bit to start with, and see if I can add Dandelions in to a Liyue-style brewing process.
Degui: Oh, and this is for you.
Degui: I'm not expecting to get this right the first time. It will probably take me many attempts. If I run out of Dandelions, I may have to ask you to do another run for me.
