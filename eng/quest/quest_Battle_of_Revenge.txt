# Battle of Revenge


## Talk 1

Asakura: You're here just in time. Today's an important day!
Traveler: Is this about your weapon...
Asakura: That's right! I've been looking all over the place for clues, and I've finally determined the location of that band of Kairagi!
Asakura: Today, I will redeem myself and take back my weapon!
Paimon: Oh! Asakura is really motivated!
Asakura: However, I mustn't make the same mistake as before. The Kairagi are numerous, and many of them are unscrupulous.
Asakura: As long as they swarm me and drain my stamina, I'll be put on the back foot, and the same thing will happen again...
Asakura: Therefore, I want you to accompany me this time.
Asakura: I was defeated by them last time because the Kairagi were able to use their numerical advantage and took turns in whittling away my stamina.
Asakura: After I ran out of energy, their leader challenged me to a duel.
Asakura: This time, I would like you to fend off the surrounding Kairagi while I challenge their leader directly.
Asakura: After I cut down that villain, I'll come and help you.
Traveler: You got it!
Asakura: I am grateful for your assistance!
Asakura: In short, I'll be leaving things to you.
Asakura: Now then, let us not delay things. Let's head off.
Traveler: It sounds like I'll be taking on many of them at once...
Asakura: Without their numbers, those Kairagi are nothing more than a rabble.
Asakura: I have faith in your skills. Even if they decide to rush at you all at once, I still believe they'll stand no chance against you.
Traveler: You think too highly of me...

## Talk 2

Paimon: While Asakura is dueling their leader, let's quickly beat these guys!
"Kairagi" Leader: It's often said that a Doushin's weapon is their dignity. You've lost to me already, so I'm surprised you had the audacity to challenge me to another duel!
Asakura: I came here because of my previous defeat... I'll wash away the shame with my own two hands!
"Kairagi" Leader: Such insolence... This time, no one will be here to help you!
Asakura: I don't need help. I can cut you down, myself!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Look! Asakura's over there!
Paimon: It seems like the Kairagi's leader is running away. That must mean Asakura won the duel!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

"Kairagi": It's you again? You barely escaped that last time and you're coming back for more?
"Kairagi": You've brought a sidekick as well... Hmph, seeing as you haven't learned anything, then we won't bother holding back!
"Kairagi": Let's go, everyone! Take them down!
