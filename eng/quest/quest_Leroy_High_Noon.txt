# Leroy: High Noon


## Talk 1

Knock: (We've already decided to investigate any strange goings-on regarding the Leroy family, knocking on the door would only alert them to what we're doing.)
Knock: (Let's knock again once we have a better understanding of the situation.)

## Talk 2

Paimon: All we know is that Benoit Leroy used to live in the Fleuve Cendre, but we don't have a clue exactly where...
Paimon: If only we had some clues to help us narrow things down...

## Talk 3

Strange Boxes: (You've seen these boxes near Benoit's house before. Judging by the traces left in the layer of dust covering them, they were opened quite recently.)
Strange Boxes: (Up close, a rank smell of fish and dampness assaults your nostrils, but when you passed by before, the boxes hadn't been moved. Where did the smell come from?)
Paimon: Urgh, this stinks like a sewer... This stuff didn't smell like this when we came around a few days back. Didn't Benoit say he only used these to store old furniture and stuff?
Paimon: Where'd this horrible stench come from, then? Did some new stuff get dumped here? ...Hmm, there's a piece of paper sticking out. Let's take a look!
Paimon: This receipt's been torn up — only half of it is left. Huh, Bracari's General Store... We've seen that name somewhere, haven't we?

## Talk 4

Strange Traces: (It has a slick, oily sensation that you're sure had to have been left by a candle.)
Strange Traces: (Who lingered here with a candle in hand, and for what purpose?)

## Talk 5

Traveler: What can you tell me about this receipt...
Bracari: A recent sale of pliers, saws, and candles? Well now, that's a strange question...
Bracari: If you want ingredients for snacks, I've got them aplenty, but these things are difficult to move, darling, I haven't got many in stock.
Paimon: We don't want to buy this stuff, Ma'am. We're just asking if someone else came to purchase them from you recently.
Bracari: Ooh, let me think, then... Yes, yes, I remember some people indeed.
Bracari: It was two youngsters, a man and a woman. They bought the items several days ago.
Bracari: They said that they wanted to do some woodwork at home, but needed some tools. Is something the matter?
Paimon: Oh, no, no, w—we're just doing a... socioeconomic survey.
Bracari: A socioeconomic survey, you say? Hehe, you're here looking for information on them, aren't you?
Bracari: This happens all too often, little one. No need to try so hard to make excuses.
Bracari: The two of them went to Benoit Leroy's old house, if that's what you're asking.
Traveler: Could you tell me anything about Benoit?
Bracari: Ah, so that's what you're here for. Well, that's no surprise.
Bracari: Once you've reached a certain age, your past will catch up to you — it matters not where you move to.
Paimon: Do you know anything about all this, Ma'am?
Bracari: Me? Well, I wasn't very close to Benoit. If you'd like to know about his family, you should look for Snodgrass.
Bracari: Go on, then. Snodgrass is a right layabout. You should be able to find him loitering about nearby.

## Talk 6

Traveler: Could you tell me about Benoit Leroy?
Areta: Well, I've certainly heard the name, but he moved away a long time ago, and even before that, we rarely spoke.
Areta: I'm none too familiar with him, so it might be best if you asked someone else.

## Talk 7

Paimon: That box looks completely out of place, and it stinks...
Traveler: I suspect it was brought here from the Fleuve Cendre.
Paimon: Meaning that someone from Benoit's family went there recently... And he was from there himself, wasn't he...
Paimon: #All the clues we've got have to do with that place, {NICKNAME}. We'll probably get more useful information there.
Traveler: Let's go, then.
Paimon: Off to the Fleuve Cendre!

## Talk 8

Traveler: What can you tell me about Benoit Leroy?
Faustier: The name's one I've heard, but I can't say I know him.

## Talk 9

Snodgrass: Ugh, so boring... I don't wanna work... When am I gonna get rich...
Traveler: Tell me about Benoit Leroy...
Snodgrass: ...Leroy? Huh. I've heard that name before. Give me a moment...
Snodgrass: Right, I got it. Benoit Leroy owned a stall that sold all kinda stuff.
Snodgrass: Also, who are you? And why're you asking after this kinda stuff?
Paimon: Actually, we just...
Traveler: His situation's a bit complicated.
Snodgrass: Uh... wait, um, has he done something wrong?
Traveler: ...
Snodgrass: Oh, right, I getcha now... But, um, I gotta ask real quick, you guys from the Spina di Rosula, or the Maison Gardiennage?
Traveler: You have the right to remain silent...
Traveler: Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law...
Paimon: #(Wow, you're really good at this, {NICKNAME}!)
Snodgrass: Alright, alright! I get it. I won't ask no more questions. Well, not like he made an honest fortune or nothing, innit? Fontaine's got a lotta laws, he's probably broken quite a few!
Snodgrass: Anyway, Officer, you've come to the right fella. Lemme tell you, I know all about Benoit, nobody knows him better — there's not much that scoundrel Benoit wouldn't stoop to.
Snodgrass: Hmm. I'm old enough to get married, so he should be an old fogey by now, huh?
Snodgrass: Anyway, I remember that his daughter, Autumn, was a real beauty — shame he never let any of us talk to her!
Traveler: Autumn?
Snodgrass: That's right, Autumn Leroy, his adopted daughter.
Snodgrass: Just think about it. He was just a fella selling flotsam and jetsam, making a little Mora here and there — how'd he suddenly get rich enough to move up to the surface so fast, huh?
Snodgrass: How else but by using his daughter, of course! Poor, pretty little thing — forced her to marry some rich old coot, he did!
Snodgrass: And whaddaya know, that rich old fart kicked the bucket after just a few years, leaving his house to her. And what's hers is Benoit's — all in all, a pretty quick way to win a life "up there," if you catch my drift.
Snodgrass: Tsk tsk, why did he get to be the one to get rich overnight— I mean, what an ol' bloodsucker, am I right?
Paimon: (Wait, did something like that actually happen!?)
Traveler: (Let's press him further.)
Snodgrass: So, Officer, was that what you wanted to ask about?
Snodgrass: I mean, if this stuff's useful to you, you could say that I've contributed to Fontaine's security, yeah?
Snodgrass: And wouldn't you say that the Maison might wanna reward a... productive, upstanding citizen such as myself?
Traveler: We already knew all of what you just said.
Snodgrass: Hey there, don't you worry, I've got other stories to tell. This is the Fleuve Cendre after all. I mean, how could a fellow lay his head to rest in peace down here without a few other peoples' secrets in his keeping?
Snodgrass: Now, Autumn's second husband — oh yes, she remarried right quick, she did — lived a bit farther off, so we didn't hear from her for ages.
Snodgrass: The next time we heard a peep from her... Well, she'd done... that.
Paimon: And what's "that"?
Snodgrass: Wait, you don't know, Officer? She murdered her second husband. Got hauled off to the Fortress of Meropide for her trouble, too. You're investigating Benoit and you didn't even know that?
Traveler: Here's a list of the people involved in the case, Officer Paimon.
Paimon: #Ah, um, sorry, Captain {NICKNAME}. This won't happen again.
Traveler: Continue.
Snodgrass: Right, right, I was just gettin' to that. Now, I heard this from someone else myself, but rumor has it that Autumn asked for her father to take the stand at her trial, but he refused.
Snodgrass: Now, Benoit was unmarried, and she was his only kid... Right, and if I recall, even though she was adopted, her parents were related to him by blood.
Snodgrass: Either way, since her one and only father didn't take the witness stand at her trial, naturally, she didn't have a chance. She was packed straight off to the Fortress.
Snodgrass: Now, as to whether he did it just so he could take the house for himself or if he had some kinda disagreement with the girl, I'm not going to guess too much, hehe.
Snodgrass: He usually puts on a friendly show, though, eh? I remember he always used to give out snacks — who woulda guessed that he was so cold-blooded?
Snodgrass: Huh. Y'know, Officer, you haven't so much as frowned this whole time. Now, I thought I was a cold fish, but are you sure you don't have ice in your veins?
Traveler: It's a matter of professionalism.
Snodgrass: And ain't that worth respect? Now then, Officers, what's the story with Benoit's crimes? How serious are they?
Traveler: No comment.
Snodgrass: Hah! That bad, huh? Well, what about his house? Will it be confiscated?
Traveler: Perhaps.
Snodgrass: Hah, I knew it! Rats might scurry up to the surface, but a rat's still a rat.
Snodgrass: Thanks, Officers, for making my day. I look forward to meeting you all again down here in the Fleuve Cendre. Hehe.
Paimon: Hmm... This... Paimon's feeling a bit conflicted about this. Benoit made a really good impression at first...
Traveler: Don't judge a book by its cover.
Paimon: *sigh* Was Paimon just too foolish to see him for who he really was?
Paimon: Anyway, this sure is a lot of food for thought. Paimon feels kinda queasy about it all — let's get out of the Fleuve Cendre as quick as we can!
Traveler: Let's go, then.
Paimon: Time to get some sun on our skin.
Traveler: We've only heard one side of the tale from a random person.
Paimon: Hmm, that's true, but Paimon doesn't think we can keep trusting Benoit like before...
Paimon: Ugh, Paimon hates this feeling! Still, it's a good thing Paimon can always trust you.
Traveler: It is a distinct possibility.
Traveler: And the secret you spoke of?
Traveler: You didn't check the documents very carefully, I see. Very disappointing.
Traveler: That will depend on what else you've got to share.
Snodgrass: Oh, I've got lots. I mean, this is the Fleuve Cendre. No one gets a good night's sleep around here without having a few other peoples' secrets in their keeping, hehe.
Traveler: We hope you'll cooperate with us.

## Talk 10

Athos: The Fleuve Cendre area just doesn't smell nice. It's not quite like "upstairs," where the air's the furthest thing from foul.
Athos: How was it? Did you have fun strolling about the Fleuve Cendre? I'm sure you had a good time talking to Snodgrass.
Paimon: Y—You were following us?
Traveler: How long have you been tailing us?
Athos: I have no interest in bandying words with children. *sigh* Even if you were to go home and tattle to your parents, I doubt they'd believe you.
Athos: A word of advice — sometimes, what you see or hear is neither real nor true.
Athos: When it comes to other people's affairs, don't insist on meddling until after you've got the full picture.
Athos: By the way, Pip said that our newspapers are in your possession. I'd like you to return them, thank you.
Black Screen Text: You have little choice but to give the newspapers to Athos.
Black Screen Text: He gives you a cold look before swiftly turning and departing.
Paimon: Paimon's got a bad feeling about that guy...
Traveler: Ditto.
Paimon: Ugh, this is so annoying! It feels like we've discovered something, but we can't put the pieces together.
Paimon: And... and Paimon's kinda confused now. Benoit's a good person who's in danger, so we should be helping him... That's what's going on, right?
Traveler: We need to observe more carefully.
Paimon: Really? Will that be okay?
Paimon: Ugh, Paimon's assumptions have been overturned so many times these past few days that she's all outta brain juice!
Paimon: But you sure are calm about all this — er, if Paimon was a bit on the stupid side, you wouldn't hold it against Paimon, would you?
Traveler: Of course I wouldn't, Paimon.
Paimon: Hehe, knew it! You really are the bestest, most reliable person in the world. Paimon's so lucky to have you!
Paimon: Y'know, when you think about it like that, maybe Paimon's actually pretty smart! It's just that she didn't grasp the whole situation at first. Yeah, it's gotta be that!
Paimon: Well then, time for Paimon to put her brilliant little brain to work and figure out what we should do next... Hmm, have we, uh, accidentally alerted them that we're onto them?
Paimon: If so, maybe we should just observe Benoit's house to see if there are any new developments, right?
Traveler: That's all we can do for now.
Paimon: Alrighty then, let's return later.
Traveler: You're not stupid, Paimon.
Paimon: Really? Well, if even you say so, then it's gotta be true.
Traveler: Best to look before you leap.
Traveler: Don't be too quick to judge.
Traveler: Just what could they be planning...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Knock: You hear nothing within the house. No one speaks, and you hear no footsteps either.
Knock: It's a bit strange how silent Benoit's household is. Almost as if the place is empty.
