## Talk

Riqueti: The sense of crisis people have at the Palais Mermonia is just... hard to assess.

## Talk

Traveler: They do seem quite busy.
Riqueti: And there's the rub.
Riqueti: We should ask ourselves this honestly â€” if we did work at normal efficiency and with the usual workload at Maison Gestion, how much would we be able to do?
Riqueti: I never thought about any of this when I was with the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol. Only when I grew older and transferred to the Maison Gestion did I have more and more questions.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about the Patrol...
Riqueti: The Patrol's membership is highly streamlined, picking only the best of the best, regardless of any member's past.
Riqueti: Even if they are the children of criminals and thus of ill repute, they can join the Patrol so long as they have the ability.
Riqueti: This sounds funny, but the Patrol is the least mechanized section of the Gardes.
Riqueti: If you asked the present Captain, Chevreuse, about that, she'd say, "Gardemeks will only block our bullets!"

## Talk

Traveler: Are you referring to the "prophecy"?
Riqueti: Ah. Are you concerned about it as well?
Riqueti: Good. Then you've got a better nose for danger than many people here in Fontaine.
Riqueti: There is no point discussing the veracity of such a thing, because before a crisis comes, no one can truly use accurate evidence to convince another.
Riqueti: But if we don't consider it at all... Some might call it optimism. Others would call it folly.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Riqueti: See you. Wish us all luck.

## Talk

Traveler: Are you referring to the "prophecy"?
Riqueti: The prophecy is the biggest crisis Fontaine has faced so far. But I have other things to worry about as well.
Riqueti: And even today some are discussing whether the prophecy was real or not. They just can't see what's really important.
Riqueti: We can't ignore all our other problems simply because we survived a major crisis. Assuming that life will be easy from now on is... well, it's either optimism or ignorance.
