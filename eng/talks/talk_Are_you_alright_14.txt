Traveler: Are you alright?
Banka: Me? I'm fine, completely fine.
Banka: It's Kumar, my younger brother... His body is frail, and he needs to rest and recuperate in a place with a lot of trees.
Banka: Before he fell sick, I used to sell in the city the quarries I hunted. But I have to look after him now, so I rarely leave the village unless it's to get medicine in the city.
Banka: Sometimes, getting ill or not is beyond our control... He's still so young, so I just hope he gets well soon.
