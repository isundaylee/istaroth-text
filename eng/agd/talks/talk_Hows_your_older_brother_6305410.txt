Traveler: How's your older brother?
Kujou Kamaji: By tradition, the position of heir should belong to my brother, Masahito.
Kujou Kamaji: I recently exchanged letters with my brother, who is currently at his military post in Kannazuka. I thought he might be angered that I took the post of my own accord... but as it turned out, he was very supportive of me.
Kujou Kamaji: He even said that I was more suited to managing the clan, and that he would support me in his role as a warrior in the Shogun's army.
Kujou Kamaji: With his support, I have more faith that we will be able to start over. This will be a difficult road, but I believe that I can help turn things around.
