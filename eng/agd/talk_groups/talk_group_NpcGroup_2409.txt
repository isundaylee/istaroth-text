Traveler: You're a Mondstadter?
Vermeer: Yes, why so surprised? There are plenty of Mondstadters living in Liyue. I guess the winds of freedom blew us all over this way, haha!

## Talk 1

Traveler: What are you up to?
Vermeer: As you can see, I'm a painter. I believe that wherever you go in the world, no matter how drab a place might seem, you can always find some color if you look closely enough.
Vermeer: I consider it my duty to travel all around the seven nations to discover brand new colors and then put them on a canvas for all to see!
Traveler: Are you looking for inspiration?
Vermeer: Yep! I saw this pool and thought, wow, what a magnificent sight!
Vermeer: Can you see why? You've got that cool blue of the water's surface contrasted with the slightly off-white cliff face, interspersed with bits of lush green vegetation... I just want to recreate every last bit of it on the canvas!

## Talk 2

Traveler: Goodbye.
Vermeer: May the God of Anemo protect you!

## Talk 3

Vermeer: Hello... Oh! You're the traveler, aren't you!
Vermeer: I heard the story about your death-defying battle with Dvalin!

Traveler: How's the painting going?
Vermeer: I've been painting here at the side of those two statues since their eyes lit up.
Vermeer: But... How should I say this? I just feel like I haven't been able to paint that perfect picture.
Vermeer: It just feels like there's something missing, you know what I mean?
Vermeer: It's like a dish that uses good ingredients and is cooked well, but... but something's just not there...
Vermeer: I don't know how to express this feeling, and I can't grasp it, either. All I can do is continue to paint.
Vermeer: Don't worry, you can laugh. Really, all this drawing is making me a little woozy. And I would have taken a short break, too...
Vermeer: But every time I close my eyes, I can suddenly see the shining eyes of those statues before me. It's as if they've come alive and are staring right at me...
Vermeer: Which is why I came back here to take a break. I shouldn't be able to see the statues' eyes from here...
Vermeer: Ah, yes. Why don't you take this painting? It's the best one I've done so far.
Vermeer: Now, if you don't mind, I'm really tired. I need a break.
Vermeer: Still, what are my paintings missing... What are they missing...
