## Talk

Traveler: Was that really so scary?
Wuyuan: Oh, still pretending, are we?
Wuyuan: I see how it is. You're playing at not having read my book, hoping that I'll give you a signed copy, eh?
Wuyuan: No problem. If you really want one that much, here's a signed copy of "Records of Jueyun: Palace Beneath the Sea."

## Talk

Wuyuan: Hello! Yes, it really is me! Thanks for being my fan.
Wuyuan: Come on then! Hand over your copy of Records of Jueyun and I'll sign it for you.
Wuyuan: Didn't bring it? No worries — I've got a few autographed copies here, I can give you one free of charge!

## Talk

Traveler: Why would I want your autograph?
Wuyuan: Hah. Trying to act like you don't know me so you stand out more, is that it?
Wuyuan: Hmph, like I haven't seen that one before! But I'm feeling nice today, so I'll play along with your little game.
Wuyuan: My pen name is Wuyuan — yes, the author of Records of Jueyun, in the flesh!
Wuyuan: I'm currently on a trip recording local myths and legends from all over Liyue.
Wuyuan: So if you have an interesting story to share, let me know! And if it ends up in my book...
Wuyuan: ...Maybe I will give you a free signed copy as a thank-you!
Traveler: Do you have any interesting stories?
Wuyuan: In truth, I've been on the trail of information concerning the Guardian Yaksha lately, which may eventually feature in my "Records of Jueyun."
Wuyuan: It's a pity, but there just isn't much to find right now except a few scattered, nondescript texts.
Wuyuan: I've heard people say that they caught sight of an adeptus at Dihua Marsh, and I had a hunch that this might be the Guardian Yaksha...
Wuyuan: But I reckon that I can just stay here and wait. After all, I am an author whose pen has been touched by the heavens themselves. Why, the material will come to me as a matter of course!

## Talk

Traveler: What's Records of Jueyun?
Wuyuan: Ay yai yai, I've never known a fan to keep up the stupid act for this long!
Wuyuan: Records of Jueyun is the top-selling, critically acclaimed book series written by yours truly. Even the Wanwen Bookhouse puts them in the most visible location in the store.
Wuyuan: You'll find all sorts of Liyue myths and legends in this series.
Wuyuan: Haw-haw, relax! Don't be nervous.

## Talk

Traveler: Maybe next time.
Wuyuan: My new book will be out soon. Come find me and I'll give you a signed copy!
Wuyuan: No need to thank me. I get people thanking me all the time.
