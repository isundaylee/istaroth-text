Shirahama: I've got to find a chance to cook a hot spring egg all by myself...

## Talk

Traveler: Hot spring egg?
Shirahama: Yeah! If you're already here at the hot springs, you've got to complete the experience with a hot spring egg!
Shirahama: The first time I tried to do it, I found the temperature of the artificial springs to be too low, but the staff wouldn't let me into the natural pools.
Shirahama: So I asked a local to help me cook one in the hottest natural pool!
Shirahama: Hehe, so I've finally gotten to taste a bona fide hot spring egg! I'm not sure if it's just because I've hyped it up, but it really tasted a lot better than your average semi-cooked egg.
Shirahama: Still, I really want to cook one for myself. I'll find a way...
