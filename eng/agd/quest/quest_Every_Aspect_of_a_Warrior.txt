# Every Aspect of a Warrior


## Talk 1

Acomitl: Why must I persist? Why can't I just give up...? Forget it, I give up! Help me, Manyoya.
Matahga: What an embarrassment! Stop acting like a child and giving up whenever things don't go smoothly. How can you even call yourself a warrior? I'm ashamed to call you my brother.
Acomitl: And are you telling me you've never been stumped and needed help?
Matahga: I have, which is why I'm here to get Father and Manyoya's opinions on the fruits of my special training. I'm not a coward like you!
Manyoya: Acomitl, I believe the captain rejected your resignation so that you could give it more thought. Don't make important decisions in the heat of things.
Manyoya: Calm down and make your own choice. The most important thing is that you don't come to regret it.
Manyoya: I'm retired, and even I don't know what the future holds for me, so I fear I haven't the right to give you any guidance.
Paimon: Whoa! So you three are siblings!
Traveler: Didn't see that coming...
Xueyoni (All Three Together): It's you two!?
Acomitl: My apologies, dear benefactor. My escape plan fell through.
Traveler: As expected.
Acomitl: Is there no way for me to escape this pain? Being a warrior is so exhausting. Why can't everything be simpler?
Xueyoni (???): Still preoccupied with thoughts of the flying squad?
Xueyoni (???): I'm sorry, Acomitl. Based on my experience, things don't get simpler that way.
Xueyoni (???): Still, I just finished repairing Matahga's arm guards. Manyoya, do yours's need any work? Hmm? We have guests.
Manyoya: Ah, they're adventurers we met during our training away from home, father. They even helped Acomitl out.
Xueyoni: Then greetings, kind friends. I'm Xueyoni, a training master and their father.
Paimon: Acomitl seems to be in terrible condition, so let us know if you need help.
Xueyoni: Thank you for the offer, but I think Acomitl is completely fine.
Paimon: Huh? You intend to just leave him be?
Xueyoni: Haha! What I'm trying to say is... Let's put it this way. You're adventurers, so you must have joined the Adventurers' Guild, right?
Xueyoni: Now that's an amazing organization. You adventurers desire to explore the world, right?
Xueyoni: Even so, I imagine every adventurer has their motivations. Some explore for the money, others desire knowledge, and some are just bored of doing nothing.
Xueyoni: So, it's a most impressive feat the Adventurers' Guild has achieved in uniting all those people under one banner.
Xueyoni: Take me for example. I'm an old man who retired after serving as a Saurian rider in the flying squad and went on to become a master trainer in our tribe. Yet, I cannot imagine what a Guild containing the master trainers of all six tribes would look like.
Paimon: Uh... What does that have to do with Acomitl?
Manyoya: That's how our father explains things. Back when he was still in the flying squad, everyone there, even the Qucusaurs, would willingly hear his opinion.
Manyoya: He's now a master trainer for our tribe, and anyone who wishes to become a warrior comes to seek his advice, so relax — just listen for now.
Xueyoni: Heh, that's all in the past, Manyoya. But I shall finish the tale all the same.
Xueyoni: We master trainers aspire toward the ideal of the "warrior." That's what inspires us to take the time and effort to design and set our training programs up.
Xueyoni: We all have a "dream warrior" we wish to see emerge, but no single person can dictate what such a warrior should be.
Xueyoni: We master trainers have found agreeing on any principles and regulations impossible, let alone forming a Guild.
Xueyoni: That "greatest warrior" has countless faces and personalities.
Xueyoni: They are strong-willed at times, but they sometimes struggle with self-doubt — not to mention how they will age and die.
Xueyoni: Must warriors be immune to burnout? I can show you multiple woven scrolls that show how self-doubt and exhaustion plague everyone equally.
Xueyoni: Must warriors be huge? I know of many who looked like giants yet were despicable beyond compare. Such are recorded upon woven scrolls too.
Xueyoni: And of course, warriors will decline, as the law of nature dictates.
Xueyoni: My kids call me a warrior, but look at me. I'm an old bird who doesn't fly anymore — I've no strength for it.
Xueyoni: A warrior with a perfect face, a person who conforms to every boring standard, will not be recognized as a hero here in Natlan.
Xueyoni: Manyoya, Acomitl, Matahga, I've brought you here, for you are to be the heroes of the Flower-Feather Clan, gazing down from a great height.
Xueyoni: Your worries and desires are fleeting states on a hero's long journey, not problems that need solving.
Xueyoni: Does leaving the flying squad mean one is no longer a warrior? Does joining the flying squad automatically make one a warrior? There are no such things.
Xueyoni: It's okay to have ambitions, to hesitate, and to feel lost. You are a warrior, and a warrior must undergo trials to become a hero.
Xueyoni: Accept how you are now, learn to live with that state, and overcome it. Never let it control you.
Xueyoni: This is the way of Natlan — the way of heroes. Do you understand?
Manyoya: I understand, Father.
Xueyoni: Acomitl, are you still hesitating?
Acomitl: ...
Xueyoni: Constant lectures aren't our family's way. Go fly with your brother and sister, just like when you were little.
Xueyoni: Let your mind and body help you decide. Staying cooped up in the house and overthinking things won't lead to any good.
Acomitl: I got it, Father.
Paimon: #Do Master Trainers always speak so abstractly? Paimon didn't really get any of it. Did you, Traveler?
Traveler: Yep. Basically, this will involve a Gliding Challenge.
Xueyoni: Adventurer, I've heard about you from my kids. You're a fascinating young person.
Xueyoni: Having the guts to compete with Manyoya, help little Acomitl... and you even gained Matahga's recognition — a true warrior, you are.
Xueyoni: I'd like to invite you to fly with these kids. How about it?
Traveler: Bring it on.
Xueyoni: Haha, alright. When you've decided, come over and let us know.
Xueyoni: All three of my kids are top-tier fliers in the Flower-Feather Clan. You'll have a great time flying together.
Traveler: Let me think about it.
Traveler: Nope. Family upbringing techniques are too profound.
Traveler: (Shrug)
Traveler: It was quite obvious.

## Talk 2

Matahga: Another race? Haha! Just wait and see!
Manyoya: You're pretty confident. C'mon, Acomitl. We can't lose here!
Acomitl: Losing to you is whatever, but there's no way I'm losing to Matahga!
Acomitl: #Traveler, be sure to give it your all, too. Don't fall for Matahga's late-game pushes. He's been doing that for ages.
Acomitl: When you're ready, let my father know, and we'll fly together.

## Talk 3

Xueyoni: Come and fly with my kids, young one. It's not every day you get to compete with the Flower-Feather Clan's finest.
Xueyoni: Chase after the *flying torch* on the course. Whoever catches it first wins. That's how I trained them when they were little.
Xueyoni: *The torch is held by a balloon decorated with red feathers*, symbolizing the responsibility and honor that a warrior should bear. I made it for them.
Xueyoni: You'll recognize it once you see it. So, are you up for the contest?
Traveler: I'm ready.
Xueyoni: Haha, great! Let's head to the starting point and get ready then.
Traveler: I need a little more time.
Xueyoni: Let us know when you're ready then.

## Talk 4

Matahga: Haha! Sorry, but I pulled ahead this time!
Acomitl: Gah, Matahga, you annoying little... You've been like this since forever, always going all out in the second half!
Matahga: Feeling bitter? Catch me if you can, then! Haha!

## Talk 6

Xueyoni: You flew well, young one!
Acomitl: How was my flying just now?
Traveler: Excellent.
Acomitl: Thanks for your encouragement, but I can tell you're still a cut above.
Matahga: Acomitl...
Acomitl: It's not what you think. I'm not discouraged because I can't outdo others. I can fly, I know I can.
Acomitl: Still, being in bad form for so long has ruined my self-confidence. I just can't approach flying with any sense of calm.
Acomitl: #Traveler's different. His posture is way more relaxed. Anyone with eyes can see that.
Acomitl: Father, I know that you and sis want me to make up my own mind and not avoid the issue.
Acomitl: But if I told you now, that whether it's my body, my brain, or my heart...
Acomitl: That they all refuse to continue on a path that's not meant for me... Would you still support me?
Manyoya: It's okay, so long as it's your own decision, and you're willing to shoulder the consequences.
Acomitl: Matahga, will you...
Matahga: Hey! I'm not going to criticize you at a time like this. I've always known the sort of person you are, Big Brother.
Matahga: If you can't handle this, then just make a decisive break with it. As long as you stay true to yourself, you remain a warrior. No one has the right to criticize you.
Xueyoni: Sometimes, the job of a Master Trainer is quite easy. I make training plans for warriors, but I don't have to take part myself.
Xueyoni: However, I, too, once flew around with Saurians day in and day out, and I know the true face of that kind of life.
Xueyoni: Criticizing others is easy. Taking action is always harder.
Xueyoni: As a trainer, I suggest you request time off to recuperate both physically and mentally, even if it leads to dissatisfaction within the team.
Xueyoni: As your father, I know you don't want to continue, and I respect that choice.
Xueyoni: No longer being part of the flying squad isn't the end of the world. The warriors of the Flower-Feather Clan don't have to prove their worth through flying alone.
Acomitl: Thank you... I was worried you'd...
Manyoya: Don't overthink it. We're your family, and we'll always help you find a way, no matter what.
Paimon: Being a warrior sure is tough! Paimon never imagined it would be this hard to join the Flower-Feather Clan's flying squad.
Traveler: We have our own hardships.
Paimon: Ooh, that's right! Thinking about all the things we've encountered along the way, we've overcome them all. That's something we can be proud of, eh?
Xueyoni: And if becoming a warrior isn't easy in itself, growing from a warrior into a hero is even more so.
Xueyoni: I've seen enough of the former to know when someone possesses the qualities needed to become the latter.
Xueyoni: You have undergone many trials, haven't you, youngster? I can see it in your eyes.
Traveler: Like you wouldn't believe.
Xueyoni: It seems I wasn't mistaken. Your path differs from ours, and you might still have a ways to go. I'd be happy to assist a future hero.
Xueyoni: What's more, you've met and helped our family.
Xueyoni: If you want to use the training course here, just let me know. You can take off from here anytime.
Traveler: Thank you.
Xueyoni: Don't mention it. If anything, I'm eager to witness the moment you become a hero, resplendent in the skies.
Traveler: (Remain silent)
Traveler: Not everyone can be a warrior.
Paimon: That's kinda strict, but it does make sense. Oh well, not like Paimon wanted to become one anyway, what with all that training every day.
Traveler: Not bad.

Xueyoni: Not bad, young one! Hahahaha!
Xueyoni: But you'll need more practice if you want to surpass my kids. Don't take it too hard, though! It's rare for anyone to achieve success in one go.
Xueyoni: If you want to try again, just come find me.
