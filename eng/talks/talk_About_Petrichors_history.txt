Traveler: About Petrichor's history...
Tiepolo: Haha! Well, there's much to tell. Petrichor's got a history longer than the Court of Fontaine, after all — so long that ten operas wouldn't be enough to get through it all.
Tiepolo: Five hundred years ago, this place was still governed by the de Petrichor family, and their lineage had long ruled here.
Tiepolo: That had been the case ever since the first Duke appointed by Egeria, and they were, one and all, just and benevolent leaders who guided the town to ever-increasing prosperity.
Tiepolo: Alas, the final patrono of the family was transferred to be mayor of Poisson — there, he lost his life, and there did the family tree wither.
Tiepolo: For a time after, it seemed as though the town would become some abandoned fishing village... At least until after our first Doge Ruggiero established the Consilium Sapientium and restored our fortunes.
Tiepolo: The townspeople at that time believed that the town fell into ruin because of our relations with the outside world grew too close, destroying our traditions.
Tiepolo: That said, our youngsters believe differently nowadays. That fellow Foscari's been advocating that it's time for change, too.
