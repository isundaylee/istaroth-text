# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Go with something that matches your inspiration.
Paimon: That's right, inspiration does work really well sometimes!
Paimon: Y'know, you put some random flowers together and that made the store's business better, just like that!
Paimon: And that means that you're plenty inspired. Just follow your heart from now on, and maybe you won't need a mentor at all!
Pauline: Really? This is the first time I've ever been told that... I seemed to have hit my stride!
Pauline: Thank you for your vote of confidence! I don't know what to say, but I'd like to thank you properly...
Pauline: Here is a token of my gratitude. Please take it!
