# Tandoori Roast Chicken

A signature chicken dish in Sumeru. The chicken was first marinated with red spices, and then roasted in a tandoor. The process of making this Sumeru classic does not involve any fancy skills, and the use of such a humble clay oven might be surprising to some. In Sumeru, a tandoor to a veteran chef is as important as a trusty sword to an adventurer.
