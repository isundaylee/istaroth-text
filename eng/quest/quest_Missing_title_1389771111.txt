## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: In the middle of a hazy night.
Gendou Ringo: Ah, I'm sorry. "No such thing" exists at the moment.
Gendou Ringo: You are so reliable... If only the F...
Traveler: Fatui?
Gendou Ringo: Uh... I mean, "If only I, the foolish Gendou Ringo, could witness your prowess in combat!"
Traveler: ...You will someday, don't worry.

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: About the strip of paper...
Gendou Ringo: Oh, you mean the Fortune Slip? It works like this.
Gendou Ringo: First, you have to shake the Fortune Slip box till a Bamboo Slip falls out. Then, give me the Bamboo Slip and I will give the corresponding Fortune Slip to you.
Gendou Ringo: If it is an inauspicious fortune, you can knot it on the Fortune Slip Hanger to turn bad luck into good luck... That's about all there is to it.
Traveler: You know so much.
Gendou Ringo: Well, after all, these are... the basic skills of a shrine maiden!

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: Give the Special Bamboo Slip
Gendou Ringo: Alright, please pass that Bamboo Slip to me... Huh, actually, you know what? I have the faintest impression that you didn't shake the slip cylinder at all.
Traveler: Really? Must've been a trick of the light.
Paimon: That's right. You just weren't paying attention, Ms. Gendou.
Gendou Ringo: M—Me? Not paying attention? C—Come now, that... that never happened. I just didn't sleep so well last night, that's all. Sorry for worrying you!
Gendou Ringo: Here's your Fortune Slip.
Paimon: (How did it go? We should've gotten the powder onto her, right?)
Traveler: (Without a hitch, Paimon.)
Gendou Ringo: Um, why are you two standing there while looking so somber? Did you get a slip with Misfortune on it?
Traveler: No, just a Modest Fortune.
Gendou Ringo: Oh, I wouldn't be too sad about that. A Modest Fortune is not bad, either. Perhaps you might encounter some challenges, but I'm sure that there's a happy ending waiting for you on the other side.
Gendou Ringo: Someone with a heart as good as yours will definitely see such fortunes through. Well, that's what I believe, at least.

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: How've things been going lately?
Gendou Ringo: Thanks for your concern. I'm feeling great, really! That I was able to become a real shrine maiden is thanks to your help, and that of many others.
Gendou Ringo: I will stay here, and I will pray for you all in earnest. If you ever have something on your mind, I'll be happy to hear you out.
Traveler: Have you heard anything from Momoyo?
Gendou Ringo: I fear that Ms. Momoyo had already left by the time I returned to this place, so I missed the opportunity to thank her in person.
Gendou Ringo: Still, I believe that we will meet again in future.

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: See you around.
Gendou Ringo: See you! May your day be blessed.

### Additional Talk 7

Traveler: Hey, Ms. Gendou?
Gendou Ringo: #...O—Oh, why, hello, Traveler! Are you here to decipher your fortune slip today?
Traveler: In the middle of a hazy night.
Gendou Ringo: Ah, I'm sorry. "No such thing" exists at the moment.
Traveler: It's been a while since there's been anything, eh?
Gendou Ringo: Um, th—that has been case, hasn't it? And perhaps there won't be any in the future ever again, really...
Traveler: What did you just say?
Gendou Ringo: Um, nothing, nothing! Don't worry about it!
