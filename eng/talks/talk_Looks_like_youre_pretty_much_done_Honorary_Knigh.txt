Phonia: Looks like you're pretty much done, Honorary Knight. Our work here is almost finished too, so we'll be heading back to Mondstadt soon.
Traveler: How did the collaboration go?
Phonia: Not bad at all. It's exposed a flaw in our current strategy â€” namely, that the long-range capabilities of our mobile forces seem to be somewhat lacking.
Phonia: During the Wargames, we had multiple skirmishes with the clockwork meka of Fontaine. Though we did have units with heavy bows, they had great difficulty penetrating the thick armor of our opponents, so we had to get in close as much as possible.
Phonia: But as a result, we lost the intel advantage that we'd expected our alchemical recon equipment to give us.
Phonia: Seems like we're going to need the Outrider's input on this one.
Phonia: Or... Perhaps Ematol could make us some miniature explosives, which we could... attach to our arrowheads?
Phonia: Yes... That sounds like it might just work.
Traveler: Safe trip back!
Phonia: See you in Mondstadt, Honorary Knight.
