# Woodland Encounter


## Talk 1

Rana: Oh, you were a big help! Thanks!
Rana: As you can see, I'm a Forest Watcher here. As for my name, it's Rana.
Traveler: #I'm Traveler.
Paimon: Paimon's Paimon! We're from a different nation.
Rana: I see. Hmm... You aren't dressed like inhabitants of the forest, nor do you look like you're from the desert, but your clothes do have good breathability and are suitable for traveling in Sumeru.
Paimon: Huh? Since Rana's a Forest Watcher...
Traveler: She should know Tighnari, right?
Rana: #Oooh! Traveler, you know Tighnari?
Rana: Tighnari may seem unapproachable, but he's actually a very nice person. He took really good care of me when I was a trainee, and his ears are gorgeous.
Paimon: Yeah! Paimon really wants to touch them...
Traveler: Me too...
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon wonders if sneaking up on him will work...
Rana: Hahaha! Tighnari will get angry if you do it without asking first.
Rana: It probably will! But his ears are so glossy, and I can't help wondering how they feel. The girl with him seems pretty interested in them too...
Paimon: Eh? Rana, are you talking about...
Traveler: Is it Collei?
Rana: #Huh? Traveler, you know Collei too?
Rana: Collei hasn't been very well, but she still works hard to protect the forest and eliminate The Withering. Everyone's worried about her.
Rana: Ahem! Anyway, a Forest Watcher's duty is to protect the forest, assist travelers, and provide guidance.
Rana: As the two of you might have noticed, lately the forest has been... less than ideal? The Fungi and beasts have been growing aggressive, then there's The Withering...
Rana: How about I escort both of you? My patrol route will pass through Vimara Village next. It's smooth sailing from there to either Port Ormos or Sumeru City.
Traveler: Sure, let's go.
Rana: Okay, I'll keep both of you safe!
Traveler: Okay, but I have a few things to take care of before that...
Rana: I see, I'll wait here for you. Stay safe!
Traveler: Paimon could do it super stealthily.
Paimon: Hey! That will still make Tighnari angry, right?
Traveler: She should know Collei, right?
Rana: #Hey, Traveler, have you met that kid?
Rana: Collei hasn't been very well, but she still works hard to protect the forest and eliminate The Withering. Everyone's worried about her.
Rana: But she's with a trustworthy senior, the one with fluffy ears, so she should be fine!
Paimon: Huh? Ears... Are you talking about...
Traveler: It's Tighnari, right?
Rana: #Oooh! Traveler, you know Tighnari?
Rana: Tighnari may seem unapproachable, but he's actually a very nice person. He took really good care of me when I was a trainee, and his ears are gorgeous.
Paimon: Yeah! Paimon really wants to touch them...
Rana: I know, right? But his ears are so glossy, and I can't help wondering how they feel.

Rana: Hahaha! Tighnari will get angry if you do it without asking first.
Traveler: Paimon could do it super stealthily.
Paimon: Hey! That will still make Tighnari angry, right?
Traveler: Is it Amber?
Paimon: "Go go Baron Bunny!"
Paimon: ...There's no way it's Amber!
Traveler: We're from a very distant place...
Paimon: #Yes! This is Paimon, and he is Traveler.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Huh? What's over there?
Rana: Stay away, you nasty mushrooms!
Paimon: #Hey, Traveler, that person over there seems to be in trouble!
Paimon: We've got to help!
