# Talk Dialog

Hardy Two-Blades: Oh, dang it! Why is it the two of you? Hmph!
Traveler: What do you mean?
Hardy Two-Blades: It's nothing. You'll understand eventually.
Paimon: What is this person doing at the training ground? Judging by his tone, could he also be one of the competitors?
Traveler: There's no need to be afraid, Paimon.
Paimon: You're right, we've defeated countless nasty people. This one's no different!
Paimon: Besides, Paimon has faith in Bongo-Head and the other Fungi! Someone with such a bad temper can't be good with Fungi anyway!
Hardy Two-Blades: I heard everything. You guys were pretty loud.
Paimon: Eeeek!
Hardy Two-Blades: I'm not interested in bickering. We'll settle it in the arena.
Traveler: He's a piece of cake.
Traveler: Hmph!
Hardy Two-Blades: Yâ€”You're still feeling cocky!?
Paimon: Whoa! Let's not make this a confrontation!
Traveler: I can be mean too.
Paimon: But what if the two of you get in a fight because you upset him...?
Paimon: Wait... he's the one Paimon should be worried about if the two of you start fighting... Just... make sure you don't hit him too hard!
Paimon: #Anyway, for your safety, Mister Mercenary, you probably shouldn't agitate {NICKNAME} any further.
Hardy Two-Blades: I'm going to become a renowned beast tamer! It doesn't serve me any purpose to settle disputes through violence outside of the arena.
Hardy Two-Blades: Stop wasting time trying to argue with me and go do whatever it is you're supposed to be doing!
Traveler: Goodbye!
Hardy Two-Blades: Shut it! Just get out of here already!
