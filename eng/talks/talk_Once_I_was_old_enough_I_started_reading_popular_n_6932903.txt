Hu Tao: Once I was old enough, I started reading popular novels. Some of them would end by having the dead come back to life and living happily ever after.
Hu Tao: Tut-tut-tut... I know it's only make-believe, but still, it always ruined the story for me. If death isn't final, there are no stakes, so it kinda makes everything that happened up to that point meaningless.
Hu Tao: "To everything there is a season: Live in life, and die in death." That is the truth. You can't have a satisfactory ending if death isn't final.
