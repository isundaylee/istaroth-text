Baiji: "Farewell, sparrows chirping under the old moon. Greetings, flowers blooming in a new land."
Message: "Though I haven't got the foggiest notion what this says, it looks interesting. Can someone explain it to me?"
Another Person's Message: "How can you not understand something that simple? She obviously just said her goodbyes to someone named 'sparrows chirping under the old moon' and then unexpectedly met someone named 'flowers blooming in a new land.'"
Message: "Oh! I get it now. But why are their names so weird?"
Another Person's Message: "People from Liyue all have strange names like that. If you get out more and go see the world, you'll understand."
