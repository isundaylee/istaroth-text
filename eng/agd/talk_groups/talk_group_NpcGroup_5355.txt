Traveler: Would anyone dare to fight you?
Venier: Ah, my friend! Where did you learn to judge a book by its cover so?
Venier: I am a musician, you see! These arms are most elegant when they pluck a lyre's strings, I assure you.
Venier: Although I do not know why, though I was exhausted after waking up from a lengthy dream, my arms now feel like they have been granted manifold strength.
Venier: I've never been this tired, not even when I would play the lyre without rest or sleep.
Venier: It seems that I shall have to return to Capitolium to get some rest...

Traveler: What's the Capitolium?
Venier: Capitolium? Why, it's... it's... Wait. Where is it again?

Traveler: Sorry for your loss...
Venier: Grief will not simply disappear. We can only let it slowly fade.
Venier: I once thought the world unjust for this reason, but will any amount of that change the past?
Venier: The more I can commit to the Iridescence Tour, the fewer opportunities there will be for sorrow.
Venier: Perhaps Dvorak, bless his good heart, was just trying to help get me on my feet when he asked for my assistance with the festival!
