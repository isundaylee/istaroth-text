# Is This Novel Amazing?


## Talk 1

Shigeru: Junkichi, the deadline to turn in the manuscript is tomorrow. No more delays!
Junkichi: There's no use pushing me! I'm stuck at a critical point in the story and I've got writer's block.
Traveler: What are you two arguing about?
Shigeru: ...Traveler! Just the voice of reason we need.
Shigeru: I'm Shigeru, an editor at the Yae Publishing House. This is Junkichi, the writer I'm in charge of.
Shigeru: His new novel, "Onibudo," is very popular. But he never meets his deadlines. Sometimes he even delays for weeks.
Shigeru: And he's at it again, of course. If he doesn't turn his manuscript in by tomorrow, I won't be able to get this month's issue into print.
Junkichi: Why don't we postpone the issue? Our loyal readers will still pay for it.
Shigeru: Don't be ridiculous. If it isn't updated regularly, the novel's reputation will go into the trash!
Junkichi: But I've just got no inspiration right now, and I'm not going to write some garbage chapter. There's just got to be an interesting story!
Shigeru: But all the other writers are basically done. You're the only one left!
Traveler: Maybe Junkichi really just needs a bit of inspiration...
Junkichi: That's right! My friend here gets me. I need inspiration!
Junkichi: I'll go around and look for some — I'm sure something will come to me!
Shigeru: Hey! That's the excuse you used last time to put it off. We're not doing this again!
Junkichi: I'm not lying this time. Come on, trust me just this once!
Shigeru: Hmm... All right. Fine. But this is the last time...
Shigeru: No further delays! Got it?
Junkichi: Okay, okay, I got it...
Junkichi: Phew... I guess I can't put it off this time...
Traveler: Let's go get some material.
Traveler: Well, time to go get some inspiration then.
Junkichi: Were it so easy...
Junkichi: But we have to do it somehow, or Shigeru will turn my house upside down...

## Talk 2

Junkichi: In the chapter I'm working on, the main character is preparing for the next big fight.
Junkichi: He needs a powerful weapon... Let me think...
Junkichi: Let's go check out the Amenoma Smithy.

## Talk 3

Junkichi: In the chapter I'm working on, the main character is trying to sell the items he collected during his adventure.
Junkichi: That will involve dealing with different types of buyers...
Junkichi: Hmm... Then let's go to Tsukumomono Groceries.

## Talk 4

Junkichi: In the chapter I'm working on, the main character sets off alone into enemy territory.
Junkichi: Gathering information is crucial to fighting the enemy. How should I write this...
Junkichi: Hmm... let's go check out the Doushin at work.

## Talk 5

Shigeru: I hope this month's issue can be printed on time...

## Talk 6

Junkichi: Sparks fly as hammers clash against anvils...
Junkichi: Amenoma Smithy is such place full of passion!
Junkichi: Blacksmiths turn rough billets and ore into powerful weapons using such simple tools.
Junkichi: If alchemy is used while forging, wouldn't it be possible to create indestructible weapons?
Traveler: Alchemy can't do that...
Junkichi: Yes! That's a good idea. The main character shall have the strongest weapon! One forged using alchemy!
Junkichi: Now, this weapon needs to have an awesome name... and an awesome backstory.
Junkichi: That's it!
Junkichi: Traveler, let's go back. I'm going to tell Shigeru about my idea.
Traveler: I don't think you understand alchemy...
Junkichi: What do you mean? Isn't alchemy the kind of thing that makes the impossible possible?

## Talk 7

Junkichi: Tsukumomono Groceries sells all kinds of goods similar to the items collected during my character's adventure.
Junkichi: I mean, Aoi always says that "one man's trash is another man's treasure."
Junkichi: Hmm... It seems like finding out what the buyer values is the key to selling goods at a high price.
Junkichi: But if I write it like this, I'll have to spend time describing psychology. It doesn't fit the theme.
Junkichi: ...Why don't I just make the main character a psychic that can intuit the needs of the buyer?
Traveler: You can't suddenly add traits to the character!
Junkichi: It's character development. It's okay. Don't worry.
Junkichi: Well, there we have it, then! I know what to write!
Junkichi: Traveler, let's go back. I'm going to tell Shigeru about my idea.
Traveler: Where's its basis in the plot?
Junkichi: Plot basis... hmm, I'll think about it while I write. It shouldn't be a problem.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Junkichi: The Doushin keep the peace in Hanamizaka. No criminals can escape their watch.
Junkichi: In the story, the enemy's knights have the same duties as the Doushin. But to make it interesting, let's make them ten times as strong.
Traveler: That's such an arbitrary number!
Junkichi: Number scales are the clearest thing in the world. That'll help us show how powerful the main character is!
Junkichi: Well, I'll... give the main character mastery over disguises. Like being able to freely change their appearance and voice.
Traveler: Is this some new character trait?...
Junkichi: This is the main character's hidden ability. An encounter with certain enemies is the best time to reveal it!
Traveler: Hey, you just made that up, right?
Junkichi: N—No... It was my plan all along. C—Come on, now!
Junkichi: Anyway, let's just go with that. Time to go tell Shigeru about my idea.
Traveler: And how will the main character solve this conundrum?...

### Additional Talk 2

Junkichi: I found inspiration at Amenoma Smithy!
Shigeru: Really? Huh. You actually did it. Well, wonderful. Tell me about it!
Junkichi: One night, the main character is suddenly enlightened, obtaining the superb alchemy ability — Sword Resurrection.
Junkichi: He can transform a rusty blade into a powerful weapon simply by saying its new name!
Junkichi: Thus, he will... Wait, what's wrong?
Shigeru: Hey... you're doing it again, aren't you!?
Traveler: "Again"?
Shigeru: Let me guess. You're going to add new character traits to continue the story.
Shigeru: And you'll be tacking more complicated features onto those traits until you finish the new chapter, right?
Shigeru: No matter how much you like the character, stop giving him so many skills! The readers are going to get confused!
Junkichi: That's always been my style. I think it's interesting. The readers will love it!
Shigeru: Don't give me that. You know the readers are starting to get confused by everything you make up!
Junkichi: Ugh, I'm done talking to you. You're so boring. Let's hear the Traveler's opinion.
Junkichi: Traveler, who do you think is right, me or Shigeru?
Traveler: What's "it"?

### Additional Talk 3

Junkichi: We visited Tsukumomono Groceries and I've had a plot breakthrough!
Shigeru: Oh? That's great. Tell me about it!
Junkichi: The main character suddenly awakens to a profound magic, the Third Eye of Perception.
Junkichi: This allows him to see into the minds of others, so that he can maximize his trade profits.
Junkichi: In this way, it's... what's wrong?
Shigeru: Hey... you're doing it again, aren't you!?
Traveler: "Again"?
Shigeru: Let me guess. You're going to add new character traits to continue the story.
Shigeru: And you'll be tacking more complicated features onto those traits until you finish the new chapter, right?

Traveler: What's "it"?

### Additional Talk 4

Junkichi: We were off observing the Doushin and I had a plot breakthrough!
Shigeru: Oh? That's great. Tell me about it!
Junkichi: The main character suddenly awakens to the use of disguises, allowing him to freely change his appearance and voice... Let's call it the Illusory Mirror!
Junkichi: This way, no matter how hard the enemy fights back, they can't stop the main character!
Shigeru: Hey... you're doing it again, aren't you!?
Traveler: "Again"?
Shigeru: Let me guess. You're going to add new character traits to continue the story.
Shigeru: And you'll be tacking more complicated features onto those traits until you finish the new chapter, right?
Shigeru: No matter how much you like the character, stop giving him so many skills! The readers are going to get confused!
Junkichi: That's always been my style. I think it's interesting. The readers will love it!

Junkichi: Ugh, I'm done talking to you. You're so boring. Let's hear the Traveler's opinion.
Junkichi: Traveler, who do you think is right, me or Shigeru?
Traveler: What's "it"?
