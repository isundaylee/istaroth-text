# Blade Dance

Characters possess 5 stacks of the Blade Dance effect, and each stack increases the Normal Attack DMG dealt by the character by 15%. Possessing 5 stacks will increase Normal ATK SPD by 15%. When a character takes DMG, they will lose 1 stack of Blade Dance. A maximum of 1 stack can be lost every second in this way. A character will gain one stack of Blade Dance for every 10s they are on the field, up to a maximum of 5 stacks. Each character's CDs, stack counts, and their effects are counted independently.
