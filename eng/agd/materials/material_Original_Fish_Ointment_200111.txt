# Original Fish Ointment

Specialized refinement material for "End of the Line."
Ointment refined from a catch from the great lake in the north. It has the effect of temporarily restoring the energy of the fish that could be made into fine bows.
It is said that in the lake dwell aquatic creatures that cannot be seen anywhere else in Teyvat.
