Traveler: Grand Conservator?
Nizam: Simply put, this is the director of the House of Daena in the Akademiya.
Nizam: Ever since the Akasha was shut down, the number of people who have wanted to reference book collections has increased, and all such applications must go through the Grand Conservator.
Nizam: As such, the scholars of the Akademiya are very concerned about this matter.
Nizam: It doesn't matter to me... But Vikram and I have had drinks together, so I have to recuse myself from supporting him, or else it may look rather suspicious.
