Hassan: If that guy doesn't come up with some new stories soon, he won't be able to keep himself fed.

## Talk

Traveler: What guy?
Hassan: That guy at the café who's always telling the same story all day.
Hassan: We studied hairdressing together before, but he dropped out halfway, saying he wanted to be some sort of "café's special resident storyteller" that would capture audiences with stories of great heroes.
Hassan: But I see he hasn't made any sort of name for himself other than being the "café's resident bum" who uses the same old rhetoric to wrangle the occasional cup of coffee from a kind customer.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Hassan: Later. One thing storytelling and hairdressing have in common is that novelty is key to attracting customers.
