Traveler: ...Whâ€”Who are you?
Smiley Yanxiao: I am Yanxiao, a sous-chef.
Smiley Yanxiao: Unless you have something seriously urgent to tell me, you'd better get out of my kitchen.
Traveler: ...Just a sous-chef?
Smiley Yanxiao: What's the big deal? Didn't you see me chopping meat and making a soup?
Smiley Yanxiao: You're not the first person to show surprise at me working as a chef, though.
Smiley Yanxiao: My story goes like this: I actually used to be a thief until I stole from the boss.
Smiley Yanxiao: I took a beating for it and was locked up for a while.
Smiley Yanxiao: After I got out, the boss took me on to help out in the kitchen.
Smiley Yanxiao: I find I'm much happier as a sous-chef than I was as a thief.
Smiley Yanxiao: I feel like this is the real me.
