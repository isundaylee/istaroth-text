# Sea Breeze Rendezvous


## Talk 1

Paimon: Over there!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Where's she going? *sigh* If someone sees her, we're toast...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Oh, look! She stopped!

## Talk 4

The Knave: Oh? You decided to stay a little longer? Let's take in the ocean view together then.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Clervie!
Clervie: Shh!
Clervie: I opened the window while no one was looking.
Clervie: Look how pretty the outside is...
Traveler: Window?
Clervie: If only I could have more than this.
Clervie: You probably think I'm being silly, huh? All this hopeless resisting... It's better to dream of what I could have than try to make it a reality, right?
Paimon: Please help us get on the same page here, Clervie. We need you to tell us what you know. Can you do that?
Clervie: Sure! Although... after you hear all this, I think you might regret that decision.
Clervie: Everyone in this family is nothing more than a tool, something to be used and exploited. We're all expendable... including me.
Clervie: As long as you're useful, you get to stick around. Lose your value... and you're handed over to The Doctor, experimented on, and given a fate worse than death. I've seen it happen again and again, and I've had enough.
Paimon: You're saying The Knave did all that?
Paimon: It's just... That doesn't seem like something she would do. She's scary and all, but it seems like even she has lines she wouldn't cross.
Clervie: Heh, I knew you wouldn't believe me.
Clervie: Everyone thinks she's a good person. They all think of her like a real "Mother"...
Paimon: "Mother"?
Clervie: But she doesn't deserve that title. She's disgraced it and tarnished it... and if I had things my way, I'd never see her again.
Clervie: If only Perrie were here. She'd understand...
Paimon: Perrie... There's that name again.
Paimon: Also, Paimon's getting a strange feeling...
Paimon: It almost feels like she's not really "here" with us. Paimon can't tell if she's actually talking to us, or if she's mistaken us for someone else...
Traveler: I'm not sure either.
Paimon: Hmm... Well, in any case, it seems like she really needs someone to talk to. We should keep her company for a little longer.
Paimon: She looks so young, but it seems like she's been through a lot.
Clervie: It's getting windy. I should close the window...
Clervie: Ooh, look at the moon! Isn't it pretty? ...Hey, wanna hear a secret? I heard that if you look up at the night sky in Snezhnaya, you can see the aurora. It's supposed to be super pretty... even prettier than the moon tonight.
Traveler: I'd love to see it.
Clervie: Perrie and I promised each other, that once we're older, we're gonna go see it together.
Clervie: But I can't find her. I'm worried she's also been... No, that wouldn't happen to her. She's special. Mother likes her a lot.
Clervie: I should really go talk to Mother, but we just fought. She doesn't want to see me, and I'm too scared to face her.
Clervie: What should I do...
Black Screen Text: Clervie appears lost in thought. She stands there silently and doesn't say another word.
Black Screen Text: After some time, Clervie seems to come back to herself. She gives a weak smile and leaves on her own.
Paimon: *sigh*... Paimon really doesn't understand what's going on with her.
Paimon: Well, let's head back. We've got an early morning tomorrow!
Traveler: She's a spirit. It could be anything.
Traveler: There's nothing here...
