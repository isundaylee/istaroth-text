# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Is there anything good to eat?
Qian: Hmm, from my sampling, there's really not much to those big restaurants.
Qian: Li Cuisine, Yue Cuisine, delicacies and delectables... What matters is the concept and atmosphere. And if you really want to know what's best, I say it has to be the snacks at Chihu Rock!
Qian: Zhongyuan Chop Suey, Grilled Tiger Fish... When Rex Lapis came to visit Chihu Rock back in the day, he too was enticed by the smells of the roadside stalls.
Qian: The accumulated aromas of a thousand years waft through this street. All who pass through can't help but salivate!
