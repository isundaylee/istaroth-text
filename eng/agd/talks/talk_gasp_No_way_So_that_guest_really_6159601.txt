# Talk Dialog

Moco: *gasp* No way... So that guest really...?
Hillie: Totally! Shh... Not so loud!
Hillie: I was on duty that morning, and it seemed like no one had left.
Hillie: But I cleaned all the guest rooms on the second floor, and guess what I noticed? All the rooms were empty...
Moco: *gasp* No. Friggin'. Way! That's sooo creepy... So what happened then?
Hillie: Then I asked Adelinde... Like hey, what happened to the guest who arrived last night!?
Hillie: And she totally ignored me! She was just like, watering the flowers in the garden and talking to herself...
Moco: What was she saying?
Hillie: She was all like, "Next year when these flowers are in season they will look gorgeous."
