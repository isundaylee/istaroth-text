Loumelat: So fishing is my Rashid.

## Talk

Traveler: I'd like to buy some fishing supplies.
Loumelat: Take your pick! They are all affordable. And rest assured my friend, I have other ways to make a fortune, hehe.

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you, again?
Loumelat: I'm Loumelat bint Atif Abu Rashid, a fisher here in Sumeru.
Loumelat: I might be good at fishing, but I was actually born in the desert. There are oases out there, sure, but we hardly ever see any fish. I didn't even know what a fish was when I was a kid.
Loumelat: It was not until I came to the harbor that I realized I was so good at fishing. I could earn in one year what other people make in three!
Loumelat: I doubt it'll be long now before I can bring my parents here to live with me. Haha, this is my Rashid!

## Talk

Traveler: What is a "Rashid"?
Loumelat: It means "the right path or calling." That's "Rashid"! It's an expression they use back in my hometown, and also a part of my name.
Loumelat: I believe everything has its Rashid. I'm drawn to fishing, and the fish are drawn to me.
Loumelat: Hehe, have you found your own Rashid?

## Talk

Traveler: See you around.
Loumelat: See you. May you find your Rashid soon.
