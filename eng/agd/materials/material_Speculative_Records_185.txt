# Speculative Records

Records collected through careful observations of the Companion Caper Chronicles' tabletop adventure game and fruit-feeding trials. Fadaweh uses these records to calculate and extrapolate various scenarios and data for the Companion Caper Chronicles. Though initially a game made for children, she will not tolerate even the slightest inaccuracy in the data.
