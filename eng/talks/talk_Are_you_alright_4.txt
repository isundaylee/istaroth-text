Traveler: Are you alright?
Fryslan: Thank you for your concern... I can still manage for now. I'm merely venting because of my sore legs.
Fryslan: If you think about it, the transportation distance is quite reasonable when purchasing commodities in bulk from Yilong Wharf right now...
Fryslan: You transport the goods from Yilong Wharf to the docks southeast of Qiaoying Village, follow the waterway to Wangshu Inn before transferring to Liyue Harbor, then load a ship bound for Dornman Port...
Fryslan: Direct land transportation through the Stone Gate is an option too, but it requires hiring too many carts. That's a hassle to manage, so water transportation is more convenient in the end.
Fryslan: I heard some amateur merchant from Mondstadt once transported goods by land the whole way through! What a madman! Just how long would it have taken him? How many dangerous areas did he have to pass through!?
