# Cooking, the Beauty of Sharing


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hi there!
Araphala: *snore* *snore*
Paimon: Hey! Hello—!
Araphala: Mmm... Tasty fruits... *snore*
Paimon: Ugh, he's in deep slumber. Oh, right. Arapacati mentioned that <color=#00E1FFFF>the power of Dendro</color> should do the trick.
Paimon: #Paimon will leave it to you, {NICKNAME}.

## Talk 2

Araphala: Oh? It's you. Long time no see.
Araphala: Whoa, where am I? Is this a cave? Ugh... I'm feeling dizzy.
Paimon: Who are you? Why are you sleeping here?
Araphala: Who am I... Ugh, so dizzy. Let me think... My name is...
Araphala: My name is Araphala! Hehe, I remember now...
Paimon: So you're Araphala! We were wondering where you'd gone... and here you were, sleeping in this cave the whole time!
Araphala: Araphala... You know my name...
Araphala: Eh? Nara!?
Paimon: He's wide awake now.
Traveler: Indeed he is.
Araphala: *sob* I'm not ready yet. Don't make porridge out of me...
Paimon: Huh? Why would anyone want to make porridge out of you!?
Araphala: M—My sister said that if I'm always half asleep like this, a bad Nara will take me and make porridge out of me...
Traveler: You do look pretty tasty!
Araphala: Waaah!!
Paimon: #Hey! {NICKNAME}, don't make jokes like that! Araphala, no one will cook you!
Araphala: ...Really?
Paimon: Really!
Araphala: Not kidding?
Paimon: #No kidding! Anyway, Paimon's name is Paimon, and this tall Nara is {NICKNAME}. Arapacati sent us...
Araphala: Arapacati? Is she doing well? How long have I been here...
Paimon: "How long," you say? Well, if Paimon recalls correctly...
Paimon: Uhh... Many, many moons ago, the seedlings sprouted from the earth, and became trees... How many Arapacatis tall were they again?
Traveler: Seven.
Paimon: #Whoa! As expected of {NICKNAME}! What an amazing memory!
Araphala: Oh, it's been so long. Oh no.
Paimon: Anyway, let's bring you up to speed. Festival Utsava is coming up...
Black Screen Text: You bring Araphala up to speed on the events so far...
Araphala: Ah, it's time for Festival Utsava, is it?
Paimon: Yeah, so Arapacati wants you back in Vanarana.
Araphala: Ugh... But I haven't completed my cooking training yet...
Paimon: Huh? Weren't you sleeping? Paimon thought...
Araphala: "Sleeping"? Oh, I was just thinking about the past. It wasn't that serious.
Paimon: Huh? Is sleeping something serious for Aranara?
Araphala: Hmm... How should I put this... We hibernate when we are in grave danger, and we compress our memories and dreams into a seed.
Araphala: If the crisis is averted and the time is right, the seed will return to the forest and grow into Aranara again.
Traveler: It sounds really tough...
Araphala: But I know that all Nara must sleep. I had a Nara friend once, a Golden Nara just like you.
Araphala: #I once came here with {F#him}{M#her} to gather the Unrivaled Fresh Fruits.
Araphala: #So, I've been picking them here since then. If {F#he}{M#she} returns, or if I make new Nara friends, we can eat them together.
Araphala: I've picked so many of them this time... Eh? Where did they go?
Paimon: So, it's you who dropped those Sunsettias we saw all along the way.
Araphala: Did I drop that many? But it's okay, hehe... I've kept the freshest and tastiest with me.
Araphala: But still... How did I drop so many...
Araphala: I remember leaving with my brothers for cooking training. But they didn't know that fresh fruits are the best ingredients...
Araphala: But while I was picking fruits... Yes, while I was picking fruits, a really huge monster appeared.
Araphala: That huge monster was five Araphalas tall and had a long tail. Even the ground quaked beneath its stomps. Besides that, I think I sensed Marana's aura inside it.
Araphala: And it was so tough! Even if Arama and Arabalika were there, it would take them some effort to tear it apart.
Paimon: Wait!? They are that strong!?
Araphala: Yes, but I'm not. So, I had to hide here. I was thinking about the past as I waited for it to leave, and the next thing I knew, you two were standing in front of me.
Paimon: Speaking of which, we did see a Ruin Drake on the way here. Is that the huge monster you mentioned?
Araphala: Is that how Nara call it? Perhaps. Very likely.
Traveler: We've taken care of it.
Araphala: #Whoa! I didn't expect Nara {NICKNAME} who looks smaller than the monster to be so strong!
Araphala: Alright, then let's go. Good Nara, let's eat fruits together.
Traveler: Ah, that huge monster! So scary!
Paimon: ...Was it that scary though?
Araphala: Yes, looks like Nara understands that it's very scary.
Paimon: #Don't worry. {NICKNAME} had defeated that huge monster before we met you!
Traveler: It sounds so convenient!
Traveler: Paimon, can you turn into a seed?
Paimon: Hey, do you have any problem with Paimon!?
Traveler: Your memory is amazing as well, Paimon.
Paimon: Hee—hee...
Traveler: No one will make you into porridge.

## Talk 3

Araphala: *snore* *snore*
Paimon: Araphala!
Araphala: Huh? Oh, it's Paimon.
Paimon: #Yeah, we are here to tell you that {NICKNAME} has taken down the huge monster outside!
Araphala: #Whoa! I didn't expect Nara {NICKNAME} who looks smaller than the monster to be so strong!
Traveler: It was alright.
Araphala: Alright, then let's go. Good Nara, let's eat fruits together.
Traveler: It was quite difficult.

## Talk 4

Araphala: Okay, let's start cooking with the Unrivaled Fresh Fruits.
Paimon: What's the difference between this "Unrivaled Fresh Fruit" and ordinary fruits?
Araphala: I understand. To Nara, all fruits may be the same, but they are different.
Araphala: Only strong trees can bear Unrivaled Fresh Fruits. Strong trees sing first when the wind blows.
Araphala: The bearings of the strong trees, these Unrivaled Fresh Fruits, are a blessing to us. That Nara friend said these fruits are so tasty they sing in your stomach.
Paimon: Paimon can't wait to see what kind of delicacy will be made from them!
Black Screen Text: Araphala starts cooking right away...
He divides the fruits equally...
Then, he gives a few portions to you and Paimon.
Black Screen Text: You try the fresh fruits together.
It sort of lives up to your expectations. They do taste like fresh fruits.
Araphala: So good. Thank you, strong trees.
Paimon: Wait! You call that cooking?
Araphala: The Unrivaled Fresh Fruit itself is the best Supreme Delicacy. It doesn't need any extra processing to present its best taste...
Araphala: Just taste it and you will understand.
Paimon: It is tasty, but it's just... it's just like eating fruits...
Traveler: It is a fruit after all.
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon guesses so...
Araphala: Don't you Nara have a dish where you cut fruits and serve them on a wooden board too?
Paimon: Huh? Do we? Wait! Are you talking about a fruit platter?
Paimon: Is a fruit platter considered a dish?
Traveler: I think so?
Paimon: It still seems a bit strange to Paimon...
Araphala: Oh, don't be a stickler for things like that. Finding better ingredients is a form of cooking too.
Araphala: While searching for ingredients, I can travel the forest and get closer to it. That's the true meaning of my cooking training.
Paimon: Is it?
Araphala: It sure is.
Araphala: I've picked Unrivaled Fresh Fruits and made my Supreme Delicacy. My cooking training is complete.
Araphala: I can return proudly to Vanarana.
Araphala: #Oh, I would've missed Festival Utsava if Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon didn't take care of that huge monster that blocked me here in this cave.
Paimon: Alright, hurry back to Vanarana!
Araphala: Indeed, indeed... Sister will scold me if I miss Festival Utsava... Just the thought of it is scary enough.
Traveler: I don't think so...
Paimon: Right? It's kinda strange to call something that hasn't been, y'know, processed... a dish.

## Talk 5

Araphala: Festival Utsava is coming, I must... *snore* I must hurry up...
Araphala: *snore* *snore*

## Talk 6

Araphala: *snore* *snore*

## Talk 7

Leaf With Careful Penmanship: (A huge leaf. Someone has written on it with neat handwriting...)
Leaf With Careful Penmanship: "...Leaves turned yellow. I picked a fresh and tasty Sunsettia."
Leaf With Careful Penmanship: "...Branches turned green. I didn't find any fruits..."
Leaf With Careful Penmanship: "Leaves are growing again, and 40 moons have passed. I picked Sunsettias outside the campsite and brought them back to Vanarana, but sister said they were still very unripe..."

## Talk 8

Araphala: Oh? It's you. Long time no see.
Araphala: Whoa, where am I? Is this a cave? Ugh... I'm feeling dizzy.
Paimon: Who are you? Why are you sleeping here?
Araphala: Who am I... Ugh, so dizzy. Let me think... My name is...
Araphala: My name is Araphala! Hehe, I remember now...
Paimon: So you're Araphala! We were wondering where you'd gone... and here you were, sleeping in this cave the whole time!
Araphala: Araphala... You know my name...
Araphala: Eh? Nara!?
Paimon: He's wide awake now.
Traveler: Indeed he is.
Araphala: *sob* I'm not ready yet. Don't make porridge out of me...
Paimon: Huh? Why would anyone want to make porridge out of you!?

Araphala: I don't want to go outside while such a scary and huge monster is roaming the area. I'm sorry, my "sister."
Paimon: Oh, Paimon sees. But Festival Utsava is coming, you should return home.
Araphala: Festival Utsava is meant to be carefree, but I'll care for my life if I leave this place. *snore* I can't do that for Festival Utsava...
Araphala: *snore* *snore* Nara Varuna...
Paimon: Ugh... This guy...
Paimon: #What do we do, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: Let's deal with the big scary monster.
Paimon: ...Paimon doesn't think anything can be scarier than Stormterror. In fact, Paimon wonders how Aranara would describe Stormterror?
Traveler: "A million Araphalas tall!"
Paimon: "To walk from its tail to the head, the moon will rise and fall!"
Paimon: C'mon, let's help him deal with that monster outside.
Traveler: Ah, that huge monster! So scary!
Traveler: It sounds so convenient!
Traveler: Paimon, can you turn into a seed?
Paimon: Hey, do you have any problem with Paimon!?
Traveler: Your memory is amazing as well, Paimon.
Paimon: Hee—hee...
Traveler: No one will make you into porridge.

## Talk 9

Araphala: *snore* When will you be back? *snore*
Traveler: (Let's wake him up once we take care of the monster...)
