# Bantan Sango Case File: Mystery of the Black Shadow


## Talk 1

Katheryne: Hello, Traveler. You couldn't have come at a better time...
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon knows where this one's going.
Traveler: Yes, let me guess. Next, you'll say...
Katheryne: Mm, as expected of an experienced adventurer. It is as you say: we do have a new commission that may suit you.
Katheryne: Bantan Sango Detective Agency is in need of manpower, and they requested your help specifically in investigating the "large scale disappearance of many small animals."
Paimon: Eh? Just a couple of small animals?
Paimon: #Aw, come on. You sure something this simple needs our glorious Traveler to step forward?
Traveler: I mean, even take-out deliveries aren't beneath me...
Paimon: Actually, isn't Bantan Sango that detective agency? Why would they need to hire adventurers?
Katheryne: Well, here's the situation: Sango has requested that a highly-experienced adventurer accompany Ryuuji on some investigations.
Katheryne: Additionally... Hmm, let me see. Sango requested that I say this:
Katheryne: "Many people have had their pets disappear, which has seen many commissions come our way in one go. If this matter can be resolved, a generous bounty shall be guaranteed."
Paimon: #"A generous bounty," she says...! Hmm, y'know what, Traveler? Paimon thinks these poor, poor animals deserve to be rescued!
Paimon: And anyway, commissions great and small are all avenues for self-improvement, aren't they?
Traveler: You're so easily led, Paimon.
Paimon: Whatever~ Let's go look for Sango!
Traveler: Sure. I've fixed carts in the past, too...
Traveler: Hey, I mean, I beat Stormterror way back when...
Katheryne: You consider defeating Stormterror a simple matter? That's... very impressive.
Traveler: Something something, new commission for me?

## Talk 2

Sango: Pretty good. You arrived more quickly than I thought.
Paimon: Of course! We came running the moment we heard about the gener— Uh, about the missing animals!
Paimon: #Alright then. What's the issue? Never fear, Paimon and Traveler are here!
Traveler: Come on, we both know who's gonna do all the work...
Paimon: Paimon'll cheer for you! That counts for something, right?
Sango: Ah, energetic as always. Well then, here's the issue. We've received a ton of commissions lately concerning lost animals. To the effect that we should find them, of course.
Sango: They're mostly pets of some kind, which means that they really shouldn't have run off by themselves.
Sango: Inazuma does have its fair share of strange tales. But everything happens for a reason, and there is nothing that cannot be solved through logic. Our on-scene investigations have borne this axiom out.
Ryuuji: Wait, don't you mean "my on-scene investigations"?
Traveler: Ehe, looks like Paimon's gonna have to cheer you on too, huh?
Paimon: What!?
Ryuuji: Thanks for the offer, but it's fine.
Ryuuji: I've been on the trail of the missing animals these past few days, and I wound up discovering some encampments out in the wild. Some of them were guarded by monsters — no big deal, really.
Ryuuji: However, just as I was attempting to release some of the trapped animals in one of the camps...
Sango: ...He was taken out by "a dark shadow that suddenly appeared."
Ryuuji: When I woke up, the camp was empty as a grave.
Sango: Tsk, not a good look for our Ryuuji, eh? *sigh* Whatever happened to the Ryuuji who roared like the wicked oni Torachiyo himself as he defeated the perpetrator of the "Sanbongatana Kinpachi" incident?
Sango: Why, and then he held me fast as I feigned death, crying out...
Ryuuji: Wait, stop! Stop, I say!
Paimon: Oh, come on! What happened next?
Traveler: Let's settle the issue on hand first, shall we?
Sango: Whatever the case, we at Bantan Sango require the aid of an adroit adventurer such as yourself to help us save these animals!
Sango: As long as you're there, we'll have an eyewitness even if Ryuuji gets knocked out again.
Paimon: Uh, Sango, so why don't you go yourself again?
Sango: Ah, ah, don't forget. I'm the brains of the party here. That's my job — using my brain. As far as I'm concerned, my flesh is but an accessory to my mind.
Paimon: (Whoa, she's lazy, and insistently so, too!)
Sango: Of course, you won't be working for free. You will be paid, just as we agreed.
Paimon: That's what Paimon likes to hear! C'mon, let's go!
Traveler: Ah, Paimon...
Sango: One moment, if you will. Please take this with you.
Paimon: Ooh... Uh, sorry, what is this thing again?
Sango: This is the *Ubiquity Net*. I had a friend make this based on records of Kamuna Onmyoudou.
Sango: It's not strong enough to capture criminals, no, but with a little aim, it should have no problem catching small animals.
Sango: With this, bringing the missing animals back should be a breeze!
Paimon: Woohoo! Easy-peasy! Thanks, Sango, you're the best!
Sango: I couldn't call that being "the best." Consider this more "an insurance policy to avoid failure," instead.
Sango: Ryuuji, go along with them, would you?
Ryuuji: Certainly.
Ryuuji: I've discovered some more traces of missing animals. Follow me.
Traveler: Well, here we go.
Sango: No problem.
Traveler: Thanks, Sango.
Traveler: High speed low drag.
Traveler: Yeah, what happened next?
Sango: Oh ho, are you interested in a case we closed previously? Well, back then, the usually kindly policeman named Kinpachi...
Ryuuji: P—Please, let's just return to the current issue...
Sango: ...You know what? Sure. Sorry, Ryuuji.

## Talk 3

Ryuuji: According to our current investigations, this should be the place.
Paimon: Huh, there really are a ton of lil' critters here. Did they all go missing?
Paimon: And this is a... dog?
Paimon: There's a dog guarding this place?
Ryuuji: Huh, so that's how it was. Mm... This is embarrassing.
Paimon: Eh? What are you embarrassed about, Ryuuji?
Ryuuji: ...This dog is the "dark shadow" that took me out in one go.
Traveler: Don't worry, maybe it was just a really strong dog.
Ryuuji: There's... no need to comfort me like that. My skills were lacking.
Paimon: Still, that upright stance and that high-flown pride...
Paimon: Huh, doesn't that remind you of someone?
Traveler: Right. Komore Teahouse's...
Paimon: Exactly! Paimon thought about him, too! We even originally thought that he could speak. Shame, though, he really couldn't.
Ryuuji: You speak of Komore Teahouse's owner?
Paimon: You know of him, Ryuuji?
Ryuuji: Somewhat. They do look similar, to be sure. We shouldn't drop our guard.
Ryuuji: Taroumaru is known to be friendly due to his many dealings with humans. But as for this dog, we don't know anything about it. As such, I advise caution.
Paimon: Mmm, point taken, Ryuuji.
Ryuuji: It's just experience talking, that's all.
Paimon: Still, why would this dog gather all these animals and stand guard over this place? Paimon doesn't get it.
Ryuuji: We may need more leads to figure this out. For now, let's focus on saving these animals. Their owners are starting to panic.
Ryuuji: #This is where you come in, Traveler. I will handle what comes after you find the animals. I will ensure that they are taken home as soon as possible.
Traveler: Not gonna team up and attack?
Ryuuji: We do not yet know if this foe can be beaten with a "team attack."
Ryuuji: ...Actually, do you have any experience in "stealth"?
Traveler: Well, back when we tried stealing the Holy Lyre der Himmel...
Ryuuji: ...That... must have been an interesting experience.
Ryuuji: Nonetheless, we should be able to rescue the animals if we can safely avoid the guard.
Ryuuji: I've planted some objects that can attract its attention. I hope that they will be of use to you.
Ryuuji: Alright then. Let's do this. I will stand guard here.
Traveler: We did avoid capture that one time at the Rite of Descension...
Traveler: We did tail a certain government official back in Ritou...
Traveler: Taroumaru.
Traveler: Huh, so you kinda suck then, eh Ryuuji?
Paimon: Hey! The dog was just too strong, that's all! Paimon doubts she'd win either, you know?

## Talk 4

Ryuuji: Very impressive! You really do have some spectacular moves.
Paimon: #Hehehe! Piece of cake for our Traveler, don'cha know?
Ryuuji: Well, then. On to our next target.
Paimon: Wait. There's more?
Ryuuji: There's more. If the number of commissions Sango received is no exaggeration, this must be the biggest disappearance of small animals in Inazuma's history.
Ryuuji: I say this, but even without history as our judge, having this many small animals disappear at once is simply abnormal.
Ryuuji: I did follow the trails I detected to other areas, and I found trapped animals there, too.
Traveler: Stealth required?
Ryuuji: Not this time.
Ryuuji: The opponents there should be no match for your skills. You'll know when you get there.

## Talk 5

Ryuuji: Thank you very much. You've been a big help.
Paimon: #Right? Traveler's the strongest there is!
Paimon: Does the number of animals tally up now?
Ryuuji: One moment... Huh. There's still some missing.
Paimon: Huh? But how...
Ryuuji: I'd hardly consider this a loss. We weren't taken out by our Black Shadow, and we managed to get a number of animals back.
Ryuuji: As such, our investigation's making progress. We're just out of leads for the time being.
Ryuuji: Let me tell you what. I'll keep investigating. You keep doing what you usually do for a while... Let's meet up at Bantan Sango Detective Agency once something new comes up.
Paimon: Well, it's not as if we've got better options.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Sango: #Do you need anything, Traveler?
Traveler: About the Ubiquity Net...
Sango: Ah, that. Well, I was originally going to have Ryuuji use it.
Sango: It's not as if our work isn't dangerous, you know? Ryuuji's been injured several times before. So I was thinking — how do I extend the range at which we can capture criminals?
Sango: I read a lot of old books and wound up designing this net, even commissioning a friend to construct it. In the end, however, "catching small animals" was as far as we got...
Sango: But whatever the case, it's come to good use in your hands, so that's a plus.
Traveler: You know, I'm curious about what happened with Sanbongatana Kinpachi...
Sango: Ooh, so you're curious about that, huh? Well, here's what happened...
Sango: ...Actually, you know what? Never mind. If Ryuuji's that opposed to me discussing that matter, I'll refrain.
Traveler: I should be heading off.
Sango: Please do. Stay safe!

### Additional Talk 2

Ryuuji: Leave what comes after the animals are found to me. I will take them home as soon as possible.
Traveler: What can you tell me about the Black Shadow?
Ryuuji: I've heard tell of a secret organization that trains ninken, or ninja dogs.
Ryuuji: They say that one such dog, code-named Inujin, destroyed countless monsters that threatened Inazuma in the shadows...
Ryuuji: ...Of course, this is just a legend. Still, I wonder if this Black Shadow could be the legendary ninken...
Ryuuji: Whatever. I shouldn't make excuses for my defeat...
Traveler: So, tell me about those distractions you set up...
Ryuuji: I was unable to save the animals while evading its case, but while I was casing the joint, I did find the time to place a few smoke dispensers nearby.
Ryuuji: If you activate these mechanisms, should be able to temporarily divert its attention. I hope that they will help.
Traveler: I'll be back soon.
Ryuuji: Good, thank you. I will stand guard here.
