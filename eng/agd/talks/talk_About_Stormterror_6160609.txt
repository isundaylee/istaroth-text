Traveler: About Stormterror...
Goth: To be frank, the Fatui's actions are more concerning to me than those of Stormterror.
Goth: Whenever I pass by, they always seem to be having some sort of meeting. They've even chased all the staff in charge of cleaning their accommodations away...
Goth: What are they planning? I do hope that they aren't hatching some nefarious plot. It will bring the name of the Goth Grand Hotel down for sure...
Goth: Well, never mind. They paid in full, at the very least.
