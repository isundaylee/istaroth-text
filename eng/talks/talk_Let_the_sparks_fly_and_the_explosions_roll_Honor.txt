Ematol: Let the sparks fly, and the explosions roll! Honorary Knight and the Helper in White, how are you enjoying "Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades"? I'd be happy to answer your questions, whenever you feel like asking them!
Traveler: Care to tell us more about the story behind the latest episode of Dodoco's adventure?
Ematol: Absolutely, I'd be delighted to! When Lisa made me responsible for the sequel, she came up with a load of ideas about the plot...
Ematol: "The big, bad Spikey Fish King, repelled by the valiant Dodoco, slunk back to his lair, tail between his metaphorical legs..."
Ematol: "The Spikey Fish Vanguard said to him: Your Highness! Why don't we gather all the Spikey Fish Elders, Spikey Fish Guards, and Spikey Fish Sweepers, and launch an unstoppable counterattack?"
Ematol: As for how the story pans out... it's probably best if you experience it yourself, Honorary Knight! After all, I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise!
Traveler: The tension's building! Go go, Dodoco!
Paimon: We're rooting for you, Dodoco!
Traveler: I'm gonna take a break now, but I'll be back!
Ematol: No problem! I'm not going anywhere, so whenever you're ready, Honorary Knight!
