# Memories of Inteyvat


## Talk 1

Paimon: Looks like Halfdan disappeared at the far end of this path...
Dainsleif: Perhaps whatever lies ahead is what he wants us to see. Let's keep going.

## Talk 2

Paimon: It's a humble hilichurl camp...
Paimon: Oh, these hilichurls look like they're in pretty bad shape, too. Some of them look like they've already... taken their final breath...
Paimon: Is this what Halfdan wanted to show us?
Dainsleif: Whether it is or not, everything here is worth investigating in detail. Inspect the area. Leave no stone unturned.

## Talk 3

Paimon: How did that flower get this far underground?
Paimon: Did someone bring it in memory of the deceased hilichurls?
Traveler: I know this flower...
Paimon: Hey, now that you mention it, Paimon thinks it looks kinda familiar, too...
Dainsleif: It is the national flower of Khaenri'ah: the "Inteyvat." It once bloomed all over the nation.
Dainsleif: It would only last two weeks before wilting. But if you were to pluck one and take it out of Khaenri'ah, the petals would stop growing and turn hard.
Dainsleif: Only when it finally returned to its home soil would the petals grow soft once more, and finally turn to dust...
Dainsleif: So the Inteyvat is a symbol for a wanderer far from home, signifying the tenderness of the homeland.
Traveler: #{PLAYERAVATAR#SEXPRO[INFO_MALE_PRONOUN_Twins2Male|INFO_FEMALE_PRONOUN_Twins2Female]}
Paimon: *gasp* So for this flower to get here, it must have been brought from...
Abyss Herald: Your Highness... so the proposal finally has your blessing?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): In focusing single-mindedly on confronting the Heavenly Principles, we neglected our original mission: the revival of the homeland.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): I should not have been so indecisive.
Abyss Herald: The device is almost ready. We await your command.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): What are the chances of succeeding?
Abyss Herald: Theoretically speaking... approximately—
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): Forget it. Even a one-percent chance is enough...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): For too long have we dwelt in the Abyss.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): Surely, they would rather return to the natural cycle of life and death as soon as possible than continue to exist as they are, without a shred of dignity.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): They cannot be made to continue paying the price... for those so-called sins.
Abyss Herald: The Order is most fortunate to be graced with your decision.
Traveler: #{F#Aether}{M#Lumine}...
Dainsleif: You saw something, didn't you? Can you tell me what it was?
Paimon: Yeah, you zoned out for quite a while there.
Black Screen Text: You relate the scene you just saw to Dainsleif...
Dainsleif: Huh. Well, people do say that twins have a special connection...
Dainsleif: It sounds as if they are attempting to make use of certain equipment to cleanse the curse. It could well be the device we saw earlier.
Dainsleif: #And... you say {F#he}{M#she} mentioned the "revival of the homeland," correct?
Traveler: Yes.
Dainsleif: No surprise there. Stubborn as ever.
Dainsleif: It appears as if the Abyss Order plans to use this location to cleanse the hilichurls of their curse and restore them to the way they once were... Then, they will serve as the foundation for reviving the nation of Khaenri'ah.
Dainsleif: After all, there can be no nation without a people.
Traveler: What do you think?
Dainsleif: Hmph, it is the height of foolishness. They have no chance of success. Not even a one-percent chance.
Dainsleif: I told you already that no one knows this curse better than I, having lived with it for 500 years... There is no redemption. There is no undoing the curse.
Dainsleif: Trying to remove it by force will achieve nothing but to inflict further suffering.
Dainsleif: So make sure you are clear in your mind. You have to tell yourself: They are no longer human.
Dainsleif: If you cling to false hope and allow yourself to become too emotionally invested, the only way is down... You will end up just like them, mired in hypocrisy.
Dainsleif: Save your strength for something worth saving.
Traveler: Why should I believe you?
Dainsleif: Oh?
Dainsleif: #Haha... But of course. I am merely someone you hired for a task, while {F#he}{M#she} is your {F#brother}{M#sister}.
Dainsleif: #It is only natural for you to side with {F#him}{M#her}.
Dainsleif: But whatever decision you make cannot deter me from mine. My chosen path is to stop the Abyss. If we have reached an impasse, then perhaps this is where we should say—
Traveler: I choose to believe you.
Traveler: But that doesn't mean I completely trust you.
Dainsleif: I see.
Traveler: A 1% chance of redemption...
Traveler: Nobody has the right...
Traveler: Especially not when these hilichurls...
Dainsleif: It seems that the three questions I put to you on our first meeting were worthwhile. You have developed your own individual views on this world.
Dainsleif: Very well. Since you have volunteered your true thoughts on this matter, I shall not hide mine from you.
Dainsleif: Right now, I have a more immediate agenda than stopping the Abyss...
Dainsleif: That is to say, the Abyss's actions here directly dishonor the final wishes of Halfdan and my other compatriots. I cannot allow this to proceed.
Traveler: I can understand that.
Dainsleif: The Abyss may appear at any moment. Be on your guard at all times as we proceed.
Traveler: Then let's stick together for this one.
Traveler: ...have already chosen the end that they desire.
Traveler: ...to make that choice on another living being's behalf.
Traveler: ...versus a 99% chance of suffering and death.
Traveler: #It just means that I don't approve of my {F#brother's}{M#sister's} methods.
Traveler: Do they have a chance?
Traveler: #{F#He}{M#She} said it was {F#his}{M#her} mission.
Traveler: I've seen this kind of flower before...

## Talk 4

Paimon: We can see the upside-down city from here, too.
Dainsleif: Wait... Watch out!
Paimon: Aaaah!
Paimon: Wh—What's going on!? Is that light coming from the room in the center? Ow, it's too bright!
Dainsleif: The mutation is continuing... Has the Abyss made its move already?
Abyss Herald: Dainsleif... I see your incessant meddling continues, and that you have once again joined forces with Our Highness's kin...
Abyss Herald: Regrettably, I was not in time to control your exit from the network... and it sent you here, of all places. This was a catastrophic error.
Dainsleif: Hmph! I am surprised that you dare to face me. You ran like a coward last time.
Abyss Herald: Our Highness's will must be done. All interferences must be removed... whatever the price to pay.
Abyss Herald: This time... the curse that torments our people must be undone, once and for all.
Dainsleif: You are the only ones who torment them.
Dainsleif: There is nothing else left of those hilichurls. Nothing besides the curse itself.
Abyss Herald: Say what you wish. I am going nowhere, Dainsleif.
Dainsleif: Then you will give your life just to delay the inevitable? How absurd. But since you wish to persist, then so be it!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Whew! You've been hunting this Abyss Herald for aaages — now you finally got him!
Dainsleif: There's no time to celebrate. The Abyss Order's device is activating, but there's still time to destroy it.
Paimon: Alright! Let's go!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: There's even a bonfire here, like what hilichurls build in the wild.
Paimon: Wait, but wasn't Dain saying that hilichurls get scared of the light when they reach the very end of their lives...?
Paimon: Hmm, maybe in the very, very end, they still want to feel some light and warmth? Uh... just thinking aloud here, could also be another reason!

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: Hilichurls usually store food in crates like these, right?
Paimon: But... these seem pretty much empty. Is it because they're so near to the end that they don't need to eat anymore?
Paimon: Hmm... Even if they don't need to eat anymore, Paimon bets they still miss food for the flavor.

### Additional Talk 3

Paimon: Seems like... these hilichurls have no life left in them at all. Before long, they'll become one with the darkness.
Paimon: The hilichurls we meet in the wild are always so rowdy... Paimon never would have imagined that this is how they spend their final days.
Paimon: We may not have a whole lot of happy memories dealing with hilichurls, but still, Paimon hopes they're at peace in their last moments.
