# The Secret of Nantianmen


## Talk 1

Jiu: The awakening is coming...
Traveler: Are you alright?
Jiu: Are you here to witness His resurrection?
Jiu: You're a little early... But you're not too late, either.
Paimon: ...What in the world is she talking about?
Traveler: Um, what are you talking about?
Jiu: Huh... Still the truth does not dawn on you...
Jiu: Though, perhaps it is better that way. For you.
Jiu: Return now, and await His awakening... Then, you shall surely understand.

## Talk 2

Jiayi: You're back. What's the situation?
Traveler: So, here's what it's like at Nantianmen...
Jiayi: ...Earthquakes, monsters, and a little girl... A missing child, presumably?
Traveler: Here's what she said...
Jiayi: ...She said what? Who's "He"? And what "resurrection"? What a load of nonsense...
Jiayi: Who knows what kind of strange books she must have been reading... Anyway, that's beside the point. I'll send for someone to bring the child back to the city at once.
Jiayi: First earthquakes, and now monsters... We musn't let that child come to harm.
Jiayi: Thank you so much. Please take these as thanks for running this errand for me.
Jiayi: Ugh, never a slow day of work, eh?

## Talk 3

Jiayi: *sigh* So much to do...

## Talk 4

Jiayi: You're back. What's the situation?
Traveler: Everything seems normal...
Jiayi: Normal? So... no earthquakes, no monsters? How strange...
Jiayi: Still, normality is good news. Thank you for your assistance, please take these as a token of my gratitude.
Jiayi: Right, onto the next task... No matter how much I get done, there's always more to do...

## Talk 5

Jiayi: You're back. What's the situation?
Traveler: So, here's what it's like at Nantianmen...
Jiayi: Really? There was actually an earthquake? ...Followed by monsters, out of nowhere?
Jiayi: The monsters are no surprise, but these earthquakes... what could be causing them?
Jiayi: Well, whatever the situation â€” safety is the top priority.
Jiayi: I will report the situation in detail to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Thank you for your assistance, please take these as a token of my gratitude.
Jiayi: Ugh, the work just keeps piling up, and I can never get on top of it...

## Talk 6

Paimon: Seems like there's nothing strange going on here after all.
Paimon: Huh? What's that little girl doing over there...
Paimon: Ah! Earthquake! What's going on!?
Paimon: Careful, Paimon feels like something bad is about to happen...

## Talk 7

Jiu: When He awakens, you will surely understand.
