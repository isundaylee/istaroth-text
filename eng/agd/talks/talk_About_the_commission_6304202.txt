# Talk Dialog

Traveler: About the commission...
Ryuuji: Go talk to President Sango if it is about the commission's status. Leave the intel gathering to me. I will go where she tells me to.
Ryuuji: You can call me Takeo or Ryuuji... Actually, never mind. Just call me Ryuuji.
Ryuuji: Takeo is my real name, but President Sango thinks it isn't tough-sounding enough, so she insists on calling me Ryuuji. This does bother me... but I'll listen to her.
