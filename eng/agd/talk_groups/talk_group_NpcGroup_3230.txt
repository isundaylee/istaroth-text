## Talk

Eboshi: My name is Erebos. In the Inazuman tongue, that would be Eboshi.
Eboshi: You have proven here that your valor is beyond compare â€” that you are a worthy savior of Sangonomiya's people. Thus, you have earned the right to ask and to be answered.
Eboshi: Still, I ask that you follow the rules and not take the truth beyond this ocean abyss.
Eboshi: What else do you wish to know?

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about the Bathysmal Vishaps...
Eboshi: They are primordial elemental beings, unbent and unbowed by the power that came from the heavens owing to their living deep underwater.
Eboshi: They are actually very intelligent, and they are adept at evolving. They would even evolve into different elemental forms throughout the history of their war against us.
Eboshi: I would not be surprised at all if they have learned language or perhaps even evolved into lizard-people of a sort.
Eboshi: The Holy Soil phenomenon is, in fact, the expansion of their habitat. That means that the primordial elemental power of the three realms is growing stronger.
Eboshi: Only by using Watatsumi Omikami's life force to awaken its second servant could we convert this raw, raging elemental power.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about Watatsumi Omikami...
Eboshi: Watatsumi Omikami, due to ill-fortune, fell into this place, beyond the jurisdiction of the heavenly order.
Eboshi: But this was undoubtedly to the good fortune of us, the people of Byakuyakoku. It has done a great many things for us.
Eboshi: Unfortunately, by making contact with us, it also grasped a truth that came before its own existence. Thus, it was forced to seek a valiant death.
Eboshi: Thus, the people would no longer suspect that there might be secrets that lay hidden in the shadows. This was the only way the people of Byakuyakoku would be allowed to live under the rule of The Seven.

## Talk

Traveler: So, what were things like before the sun and moon?
Eboshi: Before Byakuyakoku fell into the deep sea, the whole world had a single unified culture.
Eboshi: Later, a great war broke out, in which the heavens capsized and the earth was ripped asunder. This land was then plunged into the dark ocean depths.
Eboshi: However, the heavenly order seemed to not wish for those who remembered all this to remain on the earth. We searched and searched for a road of return, but there was none to be found.
Eboshi: Much, much later, heaven's powers of prohibition would gradually weaken. Thus did Watatsumi Omikami manage to fall into this place.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about the Dainichi Mikoshi.
Eboshi: The Dainichi Mikoshi was constructed by the Sage Abrax. It has the power to bring light to the dark depths.
Eboshi: It has quite a few other functions, to boot.
Eboshi: All in all, it is a very powerful device.

## Talk

Traveler: I've got nothing else to ask.
Eboshi: Fair enough. Again, please remember to keep all that you have seen here in Enkanomiya an eternal secret.
