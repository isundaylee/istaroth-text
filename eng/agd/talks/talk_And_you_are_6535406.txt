# Talk Dialog

Traveler: And you are...?
Bossuet: You don't know of me? Or rather, you don't recognize me? Oh, wonderful. Raimondo and Choiseul's plan to erase me from the Institute has gone swimmingly. How happy I am for them.
Bossuet: Pleased to make your acquaintance, Honorary Senior Researcher. I am Bossuet, and I once worked at the Fontaine Research Institute.
Bossuet: I believe you might have found many a fruit of my academic labor in the Institute, and met some of my mentees to boot. Your fame has reached me here, thanks to the trusty Steambird.
Bossuet: Oh, by the way, I've resigned from my post as a researcher, and I'm here in quiet retirement. Not taking mentorships at the moment.
Bossuet: So if that's what you were looking for, you're going to be disappointed, I fear.
