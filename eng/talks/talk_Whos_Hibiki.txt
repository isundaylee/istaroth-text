Traveler: Who's Hibiki?
Neko: Hibiki is Hibiki. She came from this shrine.
Neko: A long, long... long, long time ago, after a huge thunderstorm, Hibiki never returned... and there was no one to help brush my fur thereafter.
Neko: Until Hibiki returns, I will care for the shrine, and will brush my own fur, meow meow.
