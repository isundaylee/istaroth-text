Paimon: Mmmm! The aroma is coming from Good Hunter!
Paimon: A thick slice of soft white toast...
Paimon: Topped with a generous serving of onion slices, lightly caramelized by the toasting... Yum yum!
Paimon: Paimon's made up her mind!
Paimon: It's an emergency! We must order ourselves a generous serving of *Fisherman's Toast* from *Good Hunter*, pronto!

## Talk 2

Paimon: It's so delicious! *om nom nom*
Paimon: Good Hunter's Fisherman's Toast is the best!
