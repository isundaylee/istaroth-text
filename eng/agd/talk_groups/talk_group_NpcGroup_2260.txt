Leong: Hello there. I'm sorry, but Boss Yip isn't in, so you'll have to wait if you're here to buy some tea.

Traveler: You are...
Leong: Just call me Leong! I'm the assistant here, and I usually do things like preparing tea and doing accounts...
Leong: Oh, and you can let me know if you want to place an order. I promise to keep those fine teas for you! Haha!

Traveler: About tea...
Leong: You've come to the right person! The boss's wife and I share the same hometown, and we came here, one after the other, many years ago. I've had all sorts of fine teas!
Leong: Qiaoying Village's Sunglo Tea has a fresh and clean aroma, and Single-Origin Yauwan Tea is refreshing with a sweet aftertaste. Both of them are exquisite and fine! You can't go wrong with either!
Leong: However... If you're looking to buy someone a gift, you should notify Boss Yip in advance.

Traveler: Why?
Leong: The tea leaves in our village are picked and sold collectively, and the profits are distributed later on, per our contracts.
Leong: All the bosses have signed an agreement with the village. Right now? The best part of the best batch of tea should have been sold out a long time ago.
Leong: The ordinary tea farmers are only left with some surplus for private consumption now. That stuff's not bad, but I wouldn't call it fit for a gift.
