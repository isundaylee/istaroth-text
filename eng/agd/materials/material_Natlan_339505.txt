A small table used as an arena in Genius Invokation TCG matches. It normally resembles an elevated box a bit more. Some players will place their Casket of Tomes inside to better carry both around, and once opened up, the various exquisitely built arenas of differing types and styles are then revealed as stages for the duels to come.
