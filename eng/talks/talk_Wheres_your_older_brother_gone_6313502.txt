Traveler: Where's your older brother gone?
Mirai: He's super awesome! He joined the army, and he's... Uh, in a really far away place, protecting all of us.
Mirai: This mission must be pretty important. He's been out for a really long time now...
Mirai: But I'm not a crybaby or a little kid anymore. I'll wait for him to come back.
Mirai: The last time my brother wrote back, he wrote about all sorts of things that happened to him out there. He sounded like he was in really high spirits. It must be because the mission's going well, and he can return soon!
Mirai: In that case, I'll go grab some flowers. When he comes back, I'll give them to him!
