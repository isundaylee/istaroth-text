Traveler: A pity?
Irus: Oh, I didn't mean anything by it. Actually, this place isn't half bad.
Irus: The guards here are pretty friendly. And as long as you work, you get Credit Coupons. Heck, they even feed you on a daily basis. If nothing else, it's certainly more stable than being a mercenary.

Irus: I hope they can find more reliable employers and do some honest work for once.
