Traveler: Is there anything you can tell me about this area?
Matsudaira: As you can see, Kannazuka is the location of the Shogunate camp. It's run by the Kujou Clan of the Tenryou Commission.
Matsudaira: Head southwest and you'll eventually reach Tatarasuna. Jade Steel, Inazuma's pride and joy, is produced there.
Matsudaira: If you go further west, that's Yashiori Island, territory of the Sangonomiya resistance.
Matsudaira: Yashiori Island also contains the corpses of slain gods and demons. It's got that spectacular valley created by the Electro Archon with her serpent-slaying sword going for it, though! So if you do really travel there, you have to go pay that place a visit.
Matsudaira: I've heard about the Tatarigami running amok near those remains, though, so it's better that you don't go there!
