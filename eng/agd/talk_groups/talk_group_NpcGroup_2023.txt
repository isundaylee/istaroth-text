Traveler: Do you have anything else?
Linlang: Well, take this chunk of rock, for example. Looks perfectly ordinary, but in fact it came from a star.
Linlang: A very long time ago, a star fell from the sky. The force of the impact when it hit the ground is what turned it this color on the outside.
Linlang: Hmm? What do you mean, looks like a regular chunk of ore?
Linlang: ...Wait, no, you're right, sorry. I grabbed the wrong one. This is just a regular chunk of ore.
Linlang: Ugh, must be the suppliers. They're always trying to sneak the odd dud into the mix... so frustrating...
Linlang: Please, take it off my hands would you? I never want to see it again.

## Talk 1

Linlang: Hello! Can I help you?

Traveler: *We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.*
Linlang: Mm? An invitation? As in, a date?
Paimon: Erm, no, this is about musical exchange! By the way, do you have any songs that you like? We can play them for you — just to show you we're legit, y'know?
Linlang: I see... Well, I do have something in mind. I'll hum, and you play. How does that sound?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Linlang: I'm listening.

### Talk 1 related talk 1

Traveler: How was that?
Linlang: My dear guest, it would be no exaggeration to compare your performance to an adeptal hymn.
Linlang: When I was just starting in this line of work, I went to Minlin to purchase some ancient jade. On the way there, I heard music coming from Qingyun Peak.
Linlang: I was so enraptured that I wondered if it might be the music of the adepti themselves, you know? Haha. Thank you — I thought I'd never get the opportunity to hear it again.
Linlang: As for the music festival, I must say that I wouldn't call myself any kind of music enthusiast — I simply happen to like this tune. So forgive me if I must decline.
Linlang: But allow me to let slip from my lips this tidbit of gossip: I believe Mingxing Jewelry's boss, Xingxi, is a closet fan of music. Perhaps you could ask her?
Linlang: Last but not least, I wish you the best of luck with your festival.

### Talk 1 related talk 2

Traveler: I've got some treasure I want to sell.
Linlang: Oh, what rare objects have you found this time? Let me have a look.
Black Screen Text: You tell Linlang about the Dragonbone Orb.
Linlang: If what you see is true, this is a truly amazing relic.
Linlang: But from a cursory examination, I can't find anything evidently special about it. Perhaps it requires extensive use to show its qualities...
Linlang: The way I see it, it does seem that the wondrous properties you ascribe to it might be a tad... exaggerated. Perhaps it was simply something entrusted to you by those who had failed in their task.
Linlang: Don't take it to heart, though. I'm just saying what's coming to my mind.
Linlang: This is quite the common occurrence in our line of work, anyway.
Linlang: Also, I believe that you did not keep this in sealed storage — it does seem like there is some wear and tear on its surface already.
Linlang: I'm afraid that there will be some price reduction on that front, too.
Linlang: How does 80,000 Mora sound? I can add 5 Bountiful Years on as specialty dishes as well.
Linlang: I believe that this is a good price.
Traveler: ...What will you use it for?
Linlang: To be honest, I would consider the story behind it more valuable than its capabilities.
Linlang: I suspect that this might be of much interest to our storytellers and opera troupes, or perhaps the great men and women of Yujing Terrace.
Linlang: It would be quite the ancient showpiece of a relic even if I were to simply mount it on our shop counter.
Traveler: A fair price. Done.
Linlang: My, that's quite forward of you. Well then, here's you Mora.
Linlang: If you should find any other such treasures, we are always awaiting your patronage.
Traveler: Let me think about it a bit more.
Linlang: No problem. After all, you should always check the goods — I mean, the prices — when you're planning to sell precious relics.
Linlang: You can come to me again once you've mulled the matter over.

### Talk 1 related talk 3

Traveler: About the Dragonbone Orb...
Linlang: Oh, have you considered your options?
Linlang: I'll take that item for 80,000 Mora and 5 Bountiful Years.
Traveler: It's yours.
Linlang: Thank you for your patronage. Here's your Mora.
Linlang: If you should find any other such treasures, we are always awaiting your patronage.
Traveler: Let me think about it one more time.
Linlang: No problem. After all, you should always check the prices on the market when you're planning to sell precious relics.
Linlang: You can come to me again once you've mulled the matter over.

### Talk 1 related talk 4

Linlang: Regarding the Nameless Treasure...
Linlang: This thing you've brought... It looks pretty good. This pattern also seems quite old indeed. Hold on while I open it.
Linlang: There are some defects here and there, but if you're eager to have it taken off your hands, I can offer you a price. It'll be fair, but it won't be high.
Linlang: I just had a look at this one. These markings are definitely those of Liyue, and you can see inscribed here an anecdote about Azhdaha.
Linlang: They say that Azhdaha was a dragon spawned by a convergence of the spirits of Geo in Liyue, and that even Rex Lapis could not easily subdue it.
Linlang: Rex Lapis thus summoned three adepti to his aid, and together they created a cavernous realm.
Linlang: Rex Lapis then battled the creature, luring it into the realm, before ordering the adepti to seal the entrance, trapping Azhdaha within.
Linlang: The patterns on the thing you brought seem to describe the three adepti joining hands to create the cavernous realm.
Linlang: I guess that there should at least be three relics of this kind. Combining all three should give us the complete item.
Traveler: You know all this...
Linlang: Well, I do trade in items of all kinds. A little general knowledge here and there couldn't hurt.
Linlang: Ah, but I digress. As I said earlier, there should be three of this item. One of them alone is likely not going to fetch a high price.
Linlang: But if you could gather all three, that would be a different story. But this looks to be quite ancient. Gathering all three might be too tall a task...
Traveler: Liyue truly is a mystical place...
Linlang: Now this I'm not certain of, but a senior of mine once told me that Liyue is too large, and its history is, similarly, far too long.
Linlang: Don't be surprised if you find strange relics in Liyue. What we know of Liyue's lengthy history is but a single drop in the wide ocean.

### Talk 1 related talk 5

Traveler: Regarding the Nameless Treasure...
Linlang: If my guess isn't off, the object you brought previously is one of three.
Linlang: It will only be complete once all three objects are gathered together.
Linlang: If you could find them all, I would be more than willing to make you a generous offer.
Linlang: I fear that they may be from too ancient a time, however, and that gathering them... could be difficult.

### Talk 1 related talk 6

Traveler: Regarding that ring...
Linlang: Oh, you've considered the matter? Will you sell or not, then?

### Talk 1 related talk 7

Traveler: Could you help us look at this antique?
Linlang: An antique? Well, you've come to the right person. I'd say that I'm the fairest at valuating such things in all of Liyue. Let's see it.
Linlang: Hmm, both the gemstone and the band are of fine quality, and it is very ancient... Yet it is very well-preserved — highly unusual.
Linlang: Still, I can't say I've ever heard the phrase "Disaster runs rampant throughout the world , and all who live do so in agony."
Linlang: Never mind that. Where did you find this ring?
Traveler: In a ruin near Cuijue Slope.
Linlang: You... You're a fair hand at this, aren't you? Not many dare to go there to hunt for treasure.
Linlang: Were those ruins surrounded by nine pillars, with a stone tablet in the center, by any chance?
Linlang: Don't look so surprised. I've heard many people who come to do business with me mention that place. They always say that such a large formation must have some sort of treasure within.
Linlang: They even say that those pillars and that ruin were built by Liyue's forebears in order to quell conflict...
Linlang: But I suppose that's just a legend. After all, if nine stone pillars could quell strife, this world would have been at peace long ago.
Linlang: But regardless of whether this legend is true or not, this ring was found in that ruin, and has to be related to that legend.
Linlang: It's got a name, a history to go with it, and it's of good quality, too. It'll fetch a fine price.
Linlang: ...Relax, I'm not going to ask how you got in there. I just do business. Other matters are none of my concern.
Linlang: All in all, I'd say this ring's worth *200,000 Mora*. What do you say?

### Talk 1 related talk 8

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Linlang: Impressive, wasn't it? Even in death, the gods pass in glory, unlike the surreptitious departure of mortals... I'm glad I was able to witness an event of such magnificence.
Linlang: It's just a shame that I couldn't have met him, or talked to him about my dreams...
Linlang: Ah, what I am saying? Sorry about that.

### Talk 1 related talk 9

Traveler: You are...?
Linlang: I am Linlang, the owner of Xigu Antiques.
Linlang: I'm very sorry, but the shop is not open yet. If you want to browse the shop, please find me at Xigu Antiques later.
Traveler: Tell me about Xigu Antiques.
Linlang: A fellow antique collector, are you?
Linlang: In that case, I do hope you will come to the store tonight.
Linlang: Right now, though, I am taking my post-breakfast walk. Apologies.

### Talk 1 related talk 10

Traveler: What are you doing?
Linlang: Oh, I'm just taking a stroll nearby to relax. I'd like to admire the scenery one more time before the sun sets.
Linlang: This land has remained at peace for a thousand years now. But sometimes, I wonder — how did the people who walked this land a thousand years ago feel?
Linlang: I cannot know, yes, but our Lord certainly does — Rex Lapis, who has gently watched over this land for a millennium...
Linlang: ...I wonder, has there been anyone at all who has been privy to his feelings across this long period?

### Talk 5 related talk 9

Traveler: Hello.
Linlang: Hello, I am Linlang, the owner of this store.
Linlang: Do you see anything you like?
Linlang: Please take as long as you need; there is plenty to see and no rush to choose.
Traveler: Anything you would recommend?
Linlang: Take a look at this piece of flint. It is a shard from the tip of the Geo Lord's polearm. Notice the ancient symbols written on there, with the masterful brushwork following the lines that naturally appear on the material's surface.
Linlang: Or this fossilized wood. It is a runner from a primordial tree, and legend says that this tree was so gigantic its root system spread throughout the entire world.
Linlang: You might also consider this bottle, which contains the venomous blood of an evil dragon that once wrought havoc on a neighboring land. Due to exposure to the air, the blood has now dried and turned to dust...
Linlang: ...However, the venom is so strong that one pinch of it would suffice to take out all the strongest men in a village. Heh.
Linlang: Beyond these, there are many other rarities and oddities in store, too. Feel free to peruse them at your leisure.
Traveler: Sounds dubious to me...
Linlang: Well, the value of an antique is whatever you make of it.
Linlang: There is a saying: "An antique's credibility is born of its owner's credulity." It is one's belief in an item as a historical relic that imbues it with meaning.
Linlang: By contrast, when you believe that an antique is fake, your denial of the item's value does not change the item in any way.
Linlang: The fact is, the items themselves hold no value for my customers. It is the stories attached to the items that hold the real value.
Linlang: There's another saying, how does it go... "As long as you have a good story to tell, you'll always find a way forward..." The same principle applies to antiques.

Traveler: Do you have anything else?
Linlang: Well, take this chunk of rock, for example. Looks perfectly ordinary, but in fact it came from a star.
Linlang: A very long time ago, a star fell from the sky. The force of the impact when it hit the ground is what turned it this color on the outside.
Linlang: Hmm? What do you mean, looks like a regular chunk of ore?
Linlang: ...Wait, no, you're right, sorry. I grabbed the wrong one. This is just a regular chunk of ore.
Linlang: Ugh, must be the suppliers. They're always trying to sneak the odd dud into the mix... so frustrating...

Linlang: Hi, I'm Linlang. I run an antiques shop called Xigu Antiques... I don't know if we've met?
Linlang: There's an abiding sense of nostalgia in the air at Lantern Rite... Normally I only get that feeling in my shop; I love it, it makes me feel so at home.
Linlang: Lantern Rite is much more ancient than any of the antiques in my shop, though.
Linlang: Antiquity has real value. I should know, I make my living off that fact. So make the most of this very precious time of year.
