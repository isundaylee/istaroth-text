# Talk Dialog

Beidou: So, you leave for a few days and come back with some serious TCG skills. Care to explain?
Kaedehara Kazuha: I was fortunate enough to have played a match with a skilled opponent.
Beidou: Oh? And who might that be? Wait, let me try to guess...
Beidou: Ningguang doesn't have the time for this sort of thing... Hmm, Xiangling and Xinyan aren't usually practicing either...
Beidou: If Yaoyao were free, she'd be running down to the ship to say hi to everyone, so that rules her out.
Beidou: #Hah, could it be Traveler? Did he happen to be in Liyue Harbor?
Kaedehara Kazuha: #Sorry Captain, you still haven't guessed it. But I did happen to see Traveler, and even forged a new friendship over cards...
Beidou: Oh, made a new friend, huh? Then I won't be able to guess it.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, I met Hu Tao, director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Have you heard of her?
Beidou: Yeah, I've heard of her before. Isn't she the one that won the King of Invokations Grand Prix in Liyue?
Kaedehara Kazuha: That's right. She said that she's been an admirer of yours for a long time, and hopes to make your acquaintance one day.
Beidou: Alright! There isn't a better opportunity!
Beidou: We'll invite her aboard to play a few matches, and I'll get a taste of playing against a champion.
Beidou: Oh, speaking of which, perhaps I should go find her personally at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. You know, to show some sincerity.
