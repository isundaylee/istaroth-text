## Talk 1

Bulletin Board: This Bulletin Board is set up by Vizier to publicize important matters in Sumeru City. Questions or doubts regarding the notices on the Bulletin Board can be posted here as well.

## Talk 2

Bulletin Board: "Notice: We are looking for experts to deal with Rishboland Tigers"
Bulletin Board: The message of the notice is blotted with a paintbrush. Beside it is a sentence in slanting, childish handwriting...
Bulletin Board: "Rishboland Raja just wanted to play with people!"

## Talk 3

Bulletin Board: "If you see dancing fairies after consuming mushrooms, please do not be alarmed. It is a normal reaction."
Bulletin Board: "But if the plants around you are starting to speak, please seek help from the nearest Forest Ranger immediately."

## Talk 4

Bulletin Board: "Due to unknown reasons, The Withering has been showing signs of expansion in both quantity and size throughout the forest."
Bulletin Board: "Not only does The Withering cause vegetation in the area to wilt, it may also be lethal to wildlife and even humans. The Forest Watchers have set up Contamination Zones to mark the area under the influence of The Withering. Please stay away from such areas."
Bulletin Board: "If you notice a new patch of The Withering in the forest, please contact a nearby Forest Ranger to have it handled professionally."

## Talk 5

Bulletin Board: The matra have discovered multiple cases of illegal Canned Knowledge trade during recent inspections in local bazaars.
Bulletin Board: Trading of Canned Knowledge is prohibited by the Akademiya and will be severely punished upon discovery.
Bulletin Board: The Akademiya will not be held responsible for any consequences of illegal usage of Canned Knowledge.

## Talk 6

Bulletin Board: "The annual Sabzeruz Festival is just around the corner. A grand festival will be held in the Grand Bazaar same as last year."
Bulletin Board: "To heat up the festive ambiance, our lady has prepared a special subsidy for all participating merchants."
Bulletin Board: "Let's celebrate Lesser Lord Kusanali's birthday together!"

## Talk 7

Bulletin Board: "Our lady left home and still hasn't returned. If you see a young girl with brown hair wearing a blue and purple dress, please contact the Homayani family. You will be duly thanked for your help!"
Bulletin Board: "If our lady herself sees this poster, please contact us immediately. Your parents are very worried about you."

## Talk 8

Bulletin Board: "He's back! My Lord, Al-Ahmar, is back!"
Bulletin Board: "The day he returns will be the day of retribution for all you leaf-heads!"
Bulletin Board: This is fake news, and we are currently investigating its source. All matters in Sumeru are posted regularly in the Akasha. Please do not trust any rumors.

## Talk 9

Bulletin Board: "My friend, are you troubled by anything? Look no further! The Almighty Lord Sangemah Bay is here to give you all the answers you seek."
Bulletin Board: "All it costs is a little Mora, and all your problems will be resolved in no time."
Bulletin Board: "Take action before it's too late! Contact information..."
Bulletin Board: This Bulletin Board is set up by Sir Vizier to regulate market transactions. Please do not post any advertisements here.

## Talk 10

Bulletin Board: "Does anyone know where to find an excellent storyteller? It has to be someone who can tell a story exactly as it is."
Bulletin Board: "I'm being haunted by a terrifying Jinni. It's threatening to kill me if I don't tell it the exact same story every day. It's been a month now, and my brain is turning to mush from this torture..."
Bulletin Board: "What a strange experience. But I've heard of a storyteller called Maddah in Puspa Café. He might be able to help you."

## Talk 11

Bulletin Board: "I've been to many nations and watched countless performances. There isn't a shred of doubt in me that Nilou is the best dancer in Teyvat. But not only were the pedants from the Akademiya unable to appreciate her performance, they even complained about it! What an insult to art!"
Bulletin Board: "Based on my experience in Mondstadt, we should organize a fan club for Nilou. Then those people who don't know anything about art wouldn't dare to insult her again."
Bulletin Board: "A fan club... Is that a part of Mondstadt's culture? Anyway... A perfect performance is a joint effort of everyone in the troupe. Placing all the attention on a single person is just not fair."
Bulletin Board: "Moreover, I believe that art itself is a bond that brings people together. I'm very happy that you enjoyed Nilou's performance."
Bulletin Board: "Based on that elegant handwriting, you must be a young lady, right? It's so good to know that there's someone else who enjoys watching dance performances. May I ask if you would like to have a cup of coffee together sometime?"
Bulletin Board: "Sorry, I'm very busy. Please speak to my manager if you need any help."
Bulletin Board: "Looks like this guy got rejected. The final message is clearly written by a tough man... he's probably the bodyguard of a rich lady or something."

## Talk 12

Bulletin Board: "Magic bottles for sale. Magic bottles that can harness the power of spirits. Please leave your payment here. Grants any wish, only one Mora."
Bulletin Board: "Magic bottles for sale. Magic bottles that grant any wishes. The price is only one Mora."
Bulletin Board: "I'm a Jinni. Just give me one Mora and I'll grant any wish of yours."
Bulletin Board: "The Citadel of Regzar is investigating the recent string of scams. Please do not panic."
Bulletin Board: "Any victims who have further questions may seek consultation for just one Mora."

## Talk 13

Bulletin Board: "Ever since I became a Forest Watcher, I spent all my time in the forest. If this keeps up, I'm gonna start talking to Dusk Birds."
Bulletin Board: "If only I could understand them... I wouldn't be as bored as I am now."

## Talk 14

Bulletin Board: "I hired a pretty decent mercenary a while ago. I think she's called Flame-Mane or something..."
Bulletin Board: "I brought her along with me each time I went out to the sea for business. Doesn't matter if it's Treasure Hoarders or the Millelith — with her by my side, there was nothing to fear. I made a fortune all thanks to her."
Bulletin Board: "But I don't think I've seen her accepting any commissions lately, and I heard monsters have increased in number on the path to Liyue... I may have to put my money in the Kalimi Exchange if this goes on."
Bulletin Board: "You don't sound like someone who does legit business... But if it's the Flame-Mane, I heard that she's been hired by the Homayani family. You're gonna have to wait quite a while before she's available again."
Bulletin Board: "And a word of advice, your money will be better spent buying 100 carpets than investing in the Kalimi Exchange!"
Bulletin Board: "You're absolutely right! Please visit our shop to buy some carpets! I can even explain in detail about how you can use each of them!"

## Talk 15

Bulletin Board: If you encounter anyone with a blank gaze or muttering to themselves in the forest, they are researchers in Satyavada Life. Please do not disturb them.
Bulletin Board: If they cause any concern, please report it to the Mahamata for proper handling of the matter.

## Talk 16

Bulletin Board: "I heard that Diwan used to be an organization that spoke out for us downtown commoners, but now it just obeys whatever the Mahamata say."
Bulletin Board: "Vizier too. That man never keeps his word. He's only there when the Mahamata tries to shed responsibility."
Bulletin Board: The Akademiya's guidance to all administrative bodies is based on the guidance of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. Please refrain from slander.

## Talk 17

Bulletin Board: "The city of wisdom is ours, as is the forest of ignorance. Atop the tree lies the remnants of the kingdom of lost dreams."

## Talk 18

Bulletin Board: "I heard that Diwan used to be an organization that spoke out for us downtown commoners, but now it just obeys whatever the Mahamata say."
