# Lantern Rite Special Jewelry Soup

Traditional cuisine made to celebrate Lantern Rite. Snapdragon, tofu, and lotus seeds are put into boiling water and simmered. Jewelry Soup earned its luxurious name from the look of the ingredients used, but contrary to its name, the soup is commonly prepared and served in ordinary households.
