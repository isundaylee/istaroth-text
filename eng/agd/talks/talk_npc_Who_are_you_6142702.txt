Traveler: Who are you?
Donna: ...Huh?
Donna: I'm just an ordinary girl... helping out here...
Donna: (Gosh, am I blushing?)
Donna: (I was daydreaming about Diluc giving me flowers... Was it obvious?)
Donna: Don't... don't look at me like that... There's nothing special about me.
Traveler: Diluc?
Donna: Oh... Did I just... say...?
Donna: I'm sorry...
Donna: I've been daydreaming about meeting Diluc here... so I...
Donna: No, I didn't...
Donna: (What do I do? I love Diluc so much!)
Traveler: Moon Pie?
Donna: Are you here... for the Moon Pies?
Donna: They are a specialty of Mondstadt, a kind of meat pie that is sweet and fulfilling.
Donna: (I could make a delicious Moon Pie and give it to Diluc...)
Donna: (Stop... stop it, Donna!)
Donna: If you have the chance, be sure to check them out!
