# Missing title (738500519)

Traveler: You seem to know a great deal.
Wenze: Honestly, it's not much. I've loved history since I was little, and I've always wanted to see these ruins in person. That's why I became an adventurer.
Wenze: Well... these are some records I've made of my adventures. You can have them.
Wenze: Nothing would make me happier than to help someone else with my knowledge!
