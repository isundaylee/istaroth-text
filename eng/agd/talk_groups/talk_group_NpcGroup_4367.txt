Traveler: I didn't expect to run into someone from Liyue here.
Yinjie: Haha, to be honest, I didn't expect to stay here for so long either!
Yinjie: My plan was to try my luck in the desert and maybe make some money, but I found out that many had the same idea.
Yinjie: It was only after they arrived here that many realized they forgot to bring this, or didn't prepare that...
Yinjie: I gave it some thought and decided to do business here in Caravan Ribat instead, and I specialize in giving adventurers a chance to resupply before venturing into the desert.

Traveler: How's business?
Yinjie: Besides a mysterious product called "Ultra Supreme Survivor Bundle Against Ultimate Sandstorm" that occasionally takes some of my business, I'm actually doing well.
Yinjie: Luckily, the merchant who sells it is difficult to find and is rarely seen, so it doesn't really affect my income.
Yinjie: Now that I think about it, I was right to abandon my plan to venture into the desert.
Yinjie: With substantial risks come substantial profits, but one should not be blinded by the benefit and overlook the danger, don't you think?
