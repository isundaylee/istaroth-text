Farghani: Why is discrepancy always inevitable at this point of calculation...?

## Talk

Traveler: What are you calculating?
Farghani: Before I answer your question, let me ask you one: What do you think Teyvat is like?
Farghani: You don't have to respond, just think.
Farghani: I have a revolutionary idea... If Teyvat was round, that would explain a lot of things.
Farghani: Why are there currents in oceans? Why would the sun and moon alternate rising? Why would there be changes in temperature?
Farghani: All that could be explained with the round-earth theory!

Traveler: See you.
Farghani: Where did it go wrong...?

## Talk

Traveler: So what's the discrepancy?
Farghani: *sigh* That there's the rub.
Farghani: My theory is perfect, but the calculation of land surface doesn't bear that out...
Farghani: Damn it, I shouldn't have ditched math classes in school! It's all Vikram's fault!

## Talk

Traveler: Why blame him?
Farghani: That's because he asked me to skip classes with him. Whenever there was a class he found boring, he would grab me and have coffee in the downtown area.
Farghani: But that guy did surprisingly well in all the foundation courses. I suspect that he dragged me out of classes on purpose, while he studied by himself at night.
Farghani: Ah, time passes so quickly. I didn't expect him to be a candidate for the next Grand Conservator now.
Farghani: I hope he gets elected so I can go around telling everyone that I skipped classes with the Grand Conservator back in the day.
