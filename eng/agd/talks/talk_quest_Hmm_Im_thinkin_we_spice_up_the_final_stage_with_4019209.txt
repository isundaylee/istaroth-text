Arataki Itto: Hmm, I'm thinkin' we spice up the final stage with a "Kaboom King"... designed after the one and oni Arataki Itto! I mean, c'mon, how epic are these horns!?
Mamoru (Mamoru, Akira, and Genta): Great idea, Boss!
Akira (Mamoru, Akira, and Genta): Great idea, Boss!
Genta (Mamoru, Akira, and Genta): Great idea, Boss!
Paimon: *sigh*... Something tells Paimon this group is about to be as useless as the one you had before...
Kuki Shinobu: Don't worry about hurting any feelings, Mr. Thoma. Just let me know if someone's being a nuisance, and I'll knock some sense into them.
"Shousei": Hornless oni... is as scary as ever...
Thoma: Haha, it's fine. As long as Itto's okay with the Kaboom King being defeated by a harpastum in the end.
