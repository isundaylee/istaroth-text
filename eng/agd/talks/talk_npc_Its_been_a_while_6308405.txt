Traveler: It's been a while.
Kurisu: Oh yes, it has been a while indeed, Traveler. How's everything?
Kurisu: You have been doing the International Trade Association a great many favors. I deeply appreciate it. If you need anything, I will try my best to help you out.
Kurisu: If it is not too much trouble, could you also help send my regards to Miss Kamisato? If you and Miss Kamisato need anything here, feel free to come find me.
