Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Hu Tao: Oh, perfect timing! I was just looking for someone to talk to when you appeared. You don't have telepathy, do you?
Hu Tao: *sigh* Aiya, aiya, no one's as considerate and kind as you are!
Hu Tao: #So... what do you want to talk about, Traveler?
Traveler: I want to hear you explain some mysterious phenomena.
Hu Tao: How can words suffice? Hmm... In this world, seeing is believing.
Hu Tao: If you have the courage, you can come with me on a stroll in the mountains one night to see for yourself.
Hu Tao: Is your heart pounding? Wanna go? Hee-hee, then it's settled~
Traveler: I want to hear about your recent works.
Hu Tao: Oh, you mean my poems, right? Ahem. It's been forever since I performed in front of someone. One sec... Get ready!
Hu Tao: "There perched two birds on a tree, one swooped down and caught a mouse, you see. In the mouse's mouth was a sprout, clinging to a seed, no doubt, so that little plant got to fly for free."
Hu Tao: How's that? Give me your thoughts.
Traveler: You really have such amazing literary talent.
Hu Tao: Right? I knew you'd have a discerning eye to appreciate my poetry.
Hu Tao: Ah, I'm so happy I could die! You're such a fantastic friend!
