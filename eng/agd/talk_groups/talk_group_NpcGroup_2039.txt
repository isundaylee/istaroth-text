Traveler: Surely you didn't gain it via fraudulent means?
Brother Qian: You're right, I didn't. I've never done anything fraudulent in my life.
Brother Qian: That said, in the interests of knowing your enemy as you know yourself, I have schooled up on all the fraudulent methods used by others so that I don't fall prey to them myself...
Brother Qian: ...For example, you often see gamblers wearing a flower on their chest. Actually, they're hollow inside. They use them to store cards, dice, and so on.
Brother Qian: Here, take this. I'd never use it anyway, I'm better than that.

Brother Qian: You play mahjong?
Brother Qian: Heh, it's what I do best. No one else even comes close.
Brother Qian: And what I really love to do to my opponents is raise the stakes to "if you lose, you join the Adventurers' Guild."
Brother Qian: I think more people have joined the guild now due to losing to me than those who've actually volunteered. I kid you not!

Brother Qian: Are you the Master of the Liyue branch?
Brother Qian: No, I'm not the Master. I'm just a volunteer that helps take care of her more trivial matters, which oftentimes ends up being an arduous and thankless task.
Brother Qian: You want to know why...? Heh, that's right, I'm in love with her.
Brother Qian: She's not at all like those delicate and helpless-looking girls. No, it's her strong and resolute character that I'm crazy about...
Brother Qian: It goes without saying that someone of the Guild Master's disposition won't be easily won. But to me, this is like the ultimate game of chance.
Brother Qian: Chasing that thrill is what drives any gambler. The higher the stakes, the more we strive to score the jackpot, no matter the odds. You know what I mean?

Traveler: What's the secret to being a winner?
Brother Qian: You want to know how to be a winning card player? Alright, I'll tell you.
Brother Qian: The thing is, it's seventy percent skill, thirty percent luck...
Brother Qian: Now, thirty percent might not sound very much — but when your opponent's skills and your own are perfectly matched, that thirty percent luck is what decides who will win.
Brother Qian: There is just one exception to this... I've heard that there's a famously unlucky adventurer by the name of Bennett in Mondstadt...
Brother Qian: If luck's not on your side, it's hopeless, no matter how good your skills are.
