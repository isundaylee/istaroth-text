# The Bunkoku Enigma


## Talk 1

Yabe: #Hey, you're Traveler, aren't you?
Yabe: I'm not sure if you remember my name, but I'm Yabe.
Traveler: Well, hello, Yabe.
Yabe: Hello, hello, hehe!
Yabe: Speaking of which, you're quite the hotshot, aren't you? Taking on the Raiden Shogun first and then braving the darkness of Enkanomiya.
Traveler: Well, you could say that.
Yabe: Great! So I have a lead on a certain treasure trove, but it'll make for a dangerous trip. Are you interested?
Yabe: Though I've always been a fan of mysterious stuff, I'd prefer not to put myself in any great danger.
Traveler: Sounds interesting. Tell me all about it.
Yabe: So, I found this when I was patrolling the Dainichi Mikoshi.
Yabe: Though it appears to be a mere stone slate, I believe it's the key to finding Bunkoku's Secret Treasure.
Traveler: Bunkoku's Secret Treasure?
Yabe: Well, the name is all I know, as not many detailed accounts of Byakuyakoku have survived through Watatsumi Island's history.
Yabe: One version says that Bunkoku was the second Prime Minister in Byakuyakoku's history. He and the Sunchild bled the people white through heavy taxation and made a huge fortune. After that, he hid his treasure in a secret chamber inside the Dainichi Mikoshi.
Yabe: Finally, he concealed the treasure chamber using the Sunfire Phantasms and summoned vengeful spirits and tainted beings from the Ley Lines to guard it.
Yabe: Bunkoku probably had an ancient-sounding name, something like "Tyeseus" of sorts. But nobody would care to record the story of a despicable traitor in detail.
Traveler: So, let's get back to the stone slate.
Yabe: Indeed, it is probably the key to unlocking Bunkoku's treasure chamber. According to my years of experience in kaidan and mystery investigation—
Yabe: It reads... Um... It's on the tip of my tongue...
Traveler: It won't hurt to be honest, you know.
Yabe: Actually, I found the slate in the storage room inside the Dainichi Mikoshi, and next to it lay a note that records both the ancient script and its translation.
Yabe: It seems that documents written during the transitory period all came with a translation alongside them. According to this note, the stone slate is directly related to the Bunkoku Puzzle.
Yabe: It also says that there are eight stone slates in total. So far, we've only recovered one. According to the note, the secret chamber is in a nearby location.
Yabe: Could I trouble you to take a look there? I don't care about the treasure, to be honest. I'll be content so long as I get to see the Bunkoku Puzzle through to the end.

## Talk 2

Yabe: Could I trouble you to take a look there? Please refrain from pushing yourself too hard. "Mysterious" is synonymous with "dangerous," after all.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Hey, did you hear that? Seems there's some sort of strange noise coming from up there.
Paimon: Looks like there's strange markings on the ceiling over that way, too!
Paimon: Let's go up there.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Seems like this is the key to unlocking the treasure chamber.
Paimon: The stone slate fits right in. From the size of it, it can ... fill up a third of this space, maybe?
Traveler: A ninth.
Paimon: Ahem! That's what Paimon means. Anyway, you get the picture.
Paimon: So, we just need eight more stone slates in here, right?
Traveler: Seven more.
Paimon: Ugh, you're so annoying! Okay, got it, got it!
Paimon: In that case, we keep a look out for similar stone slates.
Paimon: Still, we're all outta leads now — We don't even know where to start looking.
Traveler: Let's return and ask Yabe.
Paimon: Good idea. Since the note says that there are eight stone slates in total, there should be some mention of their whereabouts, right?
Paimon: Well, let's go look for Yabe then.
Traveler: We could leave it to fate.
Paimon: You're giving up already? Paimon thinks we can go ask Yabe.
Paimon: Since the note says that there are eight stone slates in total, there should be some mention of their whereabouts, right?
Traveler: There are eight of them in total.

## Talk 5

Yabe: You're back. Did you find anything?
Traveler: There is indeed a secret chamber.
Yabe: So it is all true?
Yabe: According to the note, all the other stone slates are divided into three groups and kept in three areas.
Yabe: I suppose you have the basic map that Tsumi drew? Let me mark them out for you there.
Traveler: Why didn't you tell us earlier?
Yabe: Well, these areas are full of danger. If the secret chamber turns out to be pure fiction, then there's no point exploring any further at all.
Yabe: My conscience wouldn't be clear I made you go into the dark depths just for a prank our ancestors once pulled.
Yabe: Alright then, these places are where the stone slates are kept.
Yabe: I—I just hope I'm interpreting it right...

## Talk 6

Paimon: Seems like this is the key to unlocking the treasure chamber.
Paimon: The stone slate fits right in. From the size of it, it can ... fill up a third of this space, maybe?
Traveler: A ninth.
Paimon: Ahem! That's what Paimon means. Anyway, you get the picture.
Paimon: So this means that we only need to place the other eight stone slates we find in here, right?
Traveler: The other seven.
Paimon: Oh, you're so annoying! Got it, got it!
Paimon: Since we've found all the stone slates, let's put 'em all inside.
Traveler: There are eight of them in total.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Whoa!
Paimon: Paimon was wondering how the secret chamber would open after we pieced the slates together... Like, would there be a portal or a secret passage in the stone wall, or something?
Paimon: Turns out that the pattern itself became the door!
Traveler: Doesn't this lead us back to the previous room below?
Paimon: Paimon doesn't think so. This giant hole just chugged open! It's definitely more than meets the eye.
Paimon: When Paimon thinks about it, Yabe did say that the chamber is concealed by the Sunfire Phantasms.
Paimon: Let's go down.

## Talk 8

Koyanagi: That's weird. Where is he?
Paimon: There's a Shade of Tokoyo here, huh? Could he be... Bunkoku?
Koyanagi: Don't you dare take me for that despicable, craven traitor! My name is Koyanagi.
Koyanagi: But since you know the name Bunkoku, you didn't follow me here with ill-intent, did you?
Koyanagi: It took my friend tons of reading and careful analysis to locate Bunkoku's Secret Treasure. By no means will I allow you to snatch it away from me!
Paimon: You're mistaken. We just, uh... got down here by chance! Yup, it was just pure luck, yes-siree!
Koyanagi: Hmph. Then scram.
Paimon: (To think that someone made it down here in the past...)
Paimon: (Did they beat us to the treasure?)
Traveler: Not likely.
Paimon: Paimon thought so too. Had they successfully found the treasure, the Bunkoku Puzzle wouldn't have remained a mystery till today.
Koyanagi: What are you two murmuring about?
Paimon: N—Nothing!
Paimon: (Anyway, let's keep investigating this place.)
Traveler: It's possible.
Paimon: No, no. Had they successfully found the treasure, the Bunkoku Puzzle should've been solved long ago. It wouldn't have remained a mystery till today.

## Talk 9

Koyanagi: What are you doing sneaking around this time?

## Talk 10

Koyanagi: How... How could this be?
Paimon: What happened?
Koyanagi: I attacked my friend... How could I have...
Koyanagi: I must've been possessed by one of the vengeful spirits summoned by Bunkoku. It must've controlled me...
Koyanagi: I mean, this treasure is nothing compared to our friendship! I—I'd never have been tempted to attack him over some petty pile of treasure.
Koyanagi: He trusted me so much that he even invited me here to witness the unveiling of Bunkoku's Secret Treasure... I...
Koyanagi: I would never do something like this...
Paimon: So the truth was concealed by the last fragment, huh?
Traveler: He needs some time alone.
Paimon: He does.
Paimon: Let's return and tell Yabe what happened.

## Talk 11

Paimon: Wait, this is... a final fragment! But why is there a ninth?
Paimon: And besides, where's Bunkoku's Secret Treasure?
Paimon: Mmm, let's see if it fits into the pattern upstairs later.

## Talk 12

Koyanagi: Hehe, hahaha! This is the conjunction of the three realms, which happens only once every century. If the treasure is hidden now, it will surely become a mystery for the ages...
Koyanagi: No, I—I'm not...

## Talk 13

Yabe: You're back!
Traveler: Hello, Ya... Ya...
Yabe: Yabe! My name is Yabe!
Yabe: *sigh* Come on, remember a guy's name, would you? Don't tell me you've also forgotten what I asked you to help me with...
Paimon: #Traveler's just joking. We've uncovered the truth of Bunkoku's Secret Treasure.
Black Screen Text: You tell Yabe what happened...
Yabe: So, there really is a secret chamber concealed by the Sunfire Phantasms? But then something else happened along the way...
Yabe: ...And the chamber is guarded by vengeful spirits and tainted beings that can control people's minds. That's... horrifying. I'm glad I didn't go with you.
Traveler: Were you scared that you might hurt us?
Yabe: No, I was more scared that you might give me a good beating.
Yabe: Anyway, I'm content... but just a little frustrated, too, strangely. Thank you. Unfathomable though the puzzle appeared, everything adds up just fine when you consider the presence of elemental powers... and somehow, that kinda kills the excitement.
Yabe: The Bunkoku Puzzle has finally been cracked, and I'll be sure to let the whole world know once I get back!
