Traveler: About tea...
Leong: You've come to the right person! The boss's wife and I share the same hometown, and we came here, one after the other, many years ago. I've had all sorts of fine teas!
Leong: Qiaoying Village's Sunglo Tea has a fresh and clean aroma, and Single-Origin Yauwan Tea is refreshing with a sweet aftertaste. Both of them are exquisite and fine! You can't go wrong with either!
Leong: However... If you're looking to buy someone a gift, you should notify Boss Yip in advance.
