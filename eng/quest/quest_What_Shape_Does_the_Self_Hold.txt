# What Shape Does the Self Hold


## Talk 1

Paimon: Look! It's over there!
Nahida: Looks like we'll have to clear out the Oozing Filth in this area. You two should be able to take care of it, right?
Paimon: Yep, we know what to do. We'll just use the Lumenstone on the Oozing Concretion!

## Talk 4

Nahida: I can feel its power lingering and shifting around us. Sometimes it feels distant, but other times it seems close. This is its way of warning us.
Nahida: It has already noticed our presence.

Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: To imagine such growth could be achieved in such a short period of time...
Paimon: It's because you're carrying everyone's hopes and dreams.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Yes, finally... we can go home.
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: Yes... home...

Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: Thank you for protecting me with your elemental power. Goodbye...
Elemental Being: Grounded Geoshroom: We may never meet again.

## Talk 11

Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: I learned a wonderful word. It's "Nur," which means "light."
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: It will be your name from now on.
Floating Hydro Fungus: ♪~
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Good, sounds like you like it.

## Talk 12

Paimon: Hey! Can you hear Paimon!? Say something!
Paimon: You Fungi said that your form didn't matter, right? Then let us know that you're all right...!
Traveler: That's enough, Paimon.
Apep: Their knowledge, memories, and emotions have been reverted to elemental power and released. They are no longer able to respond to you.
Apep: The guardians that have accompanied me for countless eras have also transformed into my elemental power, just as they did.
Apep: They will be born once again now that they're one. There's nothing to be sad about.
Paimon: But that's different! They won't ever be the same...
Nahida: Paimon, we will never understand it, and it will never understand us. That's how it's destined to be.
Nahida: But as long as you can be healthy again, then nothing else matters to me, Apep.
Nahida: Sumeru will be free from threat as long as your health is maintained.
Apep: I thought that my rage would be kindled once my power returned to me.
Apep: However, what I feel now is a feeling that has long eluded me... the feeling of "peace."
Nahida: The forbidden knowledge influenced you ever since you were contaminated, greatly amplifying your hatred and rage.
Apep: Yes... there's no denying that. Although my hatred for that usurper from beyond the heavens still stirs deep within me, destroying you and your people serves me no purpose.
Apep: Be that as it may, my position still stands, and I will have nothing to do with you.
Apep: When you inevitably perish due to your ever-expanding curiosity, I will still sneer and mock you in my heart.
Paimon: Yeesh, who can put up with you?
Nahida: I respect your decision, and with time, I will prove to you that we will not repeat our mistakes.
Nahida: Before you begin resting, there is one last thing I would like to know.
Nahida: How did you become affected by forbidden knowledge?
Apep: It's a long story... We all once believed in the distant past that only forbidden knowledge could give us enough power to defeat the Heavenly Principles.
Apep: The Drago{RUBY#[S]Nibelung}n King acquired the power of darkness from outside of this world and led us in a fight against the order established by the outsiders.
Paimon: D—Dragon King!?
Apep: An unimaginable war took place in Teyvat, causing destruction on an unprecedented scale. The world itself was on the verge of collapse.
Apep: In war, the victor would inherit the right to shape the world, while the losers must turn into ash...
Apep: But I didn't give up on searching for a way to turn the tides, even after the death of the Dragon King.
Apep: As I attempted to collect more forbidden knowledge from the corners of the world as it was on the verge of collapse... I was stopped by the giant spike that fell from the sky.
Apep: Sand dunes arose where there was only forest, and it was as if even Sumeru itself was trying to tell me that the era of the dragons was over.
Nahida: But you still didn't give up, did you? Because of Amun... Al-Ahmar.
Apep: Yes. Al-Ahmar eventually obtained this power
with the help of Nabu M{RUBY#[S]The Goddess of Flowers}alikata.
Apep: His ambitions continued to grow, and he planned to establish a powerful kingdom in my domain.
Apep: Although I didn't think much of him, I allowed his actions under one condition...
Apep: The condition was that after his death, all the knowledge he came to accumulate would belong to me.
Apep: At that time, I still harbored deep regrets. By the time the Dragon King finally returned, the world had irrevocably changed.
Apep: Some of the dragons have grown close to your kind and have forgotten all about our hatred from when the world was taken from us.
Apep: And some died, leaving behind nothing but their bones, while others chose to flee after experiencing pain and agony...
Apep: But for me, the scales and will of the Dragon King still shine bright in my heart even to this day.
Apep: I will follow them until the end of my time.
Nahida: You really are insane...
Apep: When Al-Ahmar's proud kingdom collapsed, I swallowed him whole as I agreed and absorbed his elemental power.
Apep: However, what I gained was no benefit... No, I gained the apocalypse.
Apep: I used up all my strength just trying to keep the pain under control... I had no energy to analyze the knowledge he had accumulated...
Apep: But even then, I still believe that his insanity was far greater than that of my own.
Paimon: So that's how the apocalypse started...
Apep: I admit that I fell for his trap. I was like a final fail-safe in his plan.
Apep: Tiny Buer, and the rest of you... continue forward. I shall keep a watchful eye.
Apep: How far will the life so dear and precious to the Heavenly Principles be able to go? I wonder...
Traveler: I know you're sad.

Paimon: Hey! Looks like we've been sent back out... Still in one piece, too!
Nahida: The dragon will need to rest for a very long time before it is fully healthy again.
Nahida: It's not as ruthless as it was before. Curing the dragon of its illness has seemingly made it more open to reason.
Paimon: Nobody's in a good mood when they're feeling sick!
Paimon: Even though we accomplished something really important, Paimon still doesn't feel happy for some reason.
Traveler: Bringing everyone home was supposed to be a happy occasion.
Nahida: Indeed, although they'll still have the chance to be born again, they've lost their memories of their journey and their feelings for their homeland.
Nahida: Each opportunity for growth is unique in its own way.
Nahida: Perhaps the immense power we released was the pouring out of all these irreplaceable emotions that had built up over time.
Paimon: Can you really call a place with no family your home...?
Nahida: Family... Right! The Hydro Fungus left behind its family.
Nahida: Those two Fungi might be waiting for it to return.
Paimon: Oh, yeah! Let's hurry and go take a look. How are we going to explain all the complicated things that happened...?
Traveler: But it seems to have lost some of its meaning.

## Talk 15

Paimon: They're still here! Have they really been waiting here all this time?
Nahida: We're back!
Floating Hydro Fungus: ♪~
Floating Hydro Fungus: ...?
Nahida: I'm sorry, I really am... But it's gone home and won't be able to return for a very long time.
Floating Hydro Fungus: !!!
Nahida: Don't be sad. It did it to protect you. Your happiness is more important to it than anything else in the world.
Nahida: It said that "Nur" is its most important family member.
Nahida: That's your name, isn't it?
Floating Hydro Fungus: ...
Floating Hydro Fungus: ...
Floating Hydro Fungus: N... Nur...
Paimon: Whoa!
Nahida: This is wonderful... So it has left traces of itself after all.
Nahida: They will definitely meet again, someday.

## Talk 16

Paimon: So that elemental life-form came all the way here on its own and spent a long time by itself?
Paimon: Wouldn't it already have become The Withering like the others...?
Nahida: There is a chance that it could avoid that end, using the power of something here...
Nahida: I'm referring to what was used to fight against the Abyss. It once repaired the rifts of Teyvat long ago.
Nahida: It has the ability to purify and stabilize powers that shouldn't exist in Teyvat.
Nahida: Forbidden knowledge that its light has shone upon is kept here forever in a different form...
Traveler: You mean... the Oozing Filth?
Nahida: Yup. It's just like soap bubbles that rise to the water's surface.
Paimon: Uh, another strange metaphor... But Paimon somehow gets this one.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: What the Lord of Dendro means is that the apocalypse was altered by the power of the giant spike and hidden within the Oozing Filth.
Nahida: Yes, and it shouldn't be far from here. Let's go and take a look.
