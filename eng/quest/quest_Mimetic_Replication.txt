# Mimetic Replication

Paz: Ah, hello there, Traveler. It would seem that you're here to take part in the Wisdom Gala.
Paz: If it would interest you, would you like to try out the game that we at Amurta have set up?
Traveler: And what sort of game would that be?
Paz: Our Darshan has set up a little game called "Mimetic Replication."
Paz: In this game, I will introduce you to the behavioral patterns of certain animals.
Paz: Of course, these patterns have been simplified and generalized to make them easier to understand.
Paz: What you'll need to do is to use the models we have prepared to imitate the actions of the corresponding animals.
Traveler: That does sound pretty simple.
Paz: Precisely. "Animals have regular behavioral patterns" is a statement that is both simple to understand and accept.
Paz: But behind something so simple lie mysteries that are most deep indeed.
Paz: However, let us put academic observation aside for the moment and simply enjoy the habitual behaviors of animals in a relaxed manner.
Traveler: I'll give this one a go, why not?
Paz: Alright. In that case, please step over here.
Traveler: I've got other things to do at the moment.
Paz: That's fine. My booth will be open throughout the Gala, so you can come over and try the game out any time.
Traveler: Can't say that sounds difficult.
