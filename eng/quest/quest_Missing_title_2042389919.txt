Traveler: What's Natlan like?
Aikawa Susumu: Haha, it's nothing like Inazuma, which has oceans surrounding it. Natlan is a country of red-hot passion, both in name and climate.
Aikawa Susumu: What I said might be a bit confusing, so here are some souvenirs I brought back. You can have them. Who knows, you might be able to get a sense of Natlan's scorching temperatures.
