# Paimon's Kamera

A convenient gadget that records and saves images when used, this one belongs to Paimon. Back when you bought it, you haggled with the seller for ages before finally scoring a bargain on this custom Kamera, which Paimon keeps with great care. You recall that the seller included a thick photo album along with the Kamera too, but you've barely seen her take it out. Just what kind of photos has she taken with that Kamera of hers?
