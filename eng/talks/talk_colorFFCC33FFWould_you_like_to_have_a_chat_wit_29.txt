# Talk Dialog

Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Would you like to have a chat with me?</color>
Kaedehara Kazuha: Alright... but what to talk about...? Let me think.
Kaedehara Kazuha: The rainy season recently set itself upon us. Any topics pertaining to rain?
Traveler: I always seem to run into heavy rain outside...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hm, if the rain is heavy, I'll usually seek shelter.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Caves are my primary choice, but if there's a wild animal inside, you must first contest it.
Kaedehara Kazuha: My second choice is an abandoned temple, but there are usually drafts and the omnipresent scent of mold.
Kaedehara Kazuha: If there are no other options, I'll shelter under a tree.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But I don't dare do this in a thunderstorm â€” too dangerous.
Kaedehara Kazuha: As a last resort, I'll try my luck on houses with their lights on... Of course, I'll give up if I'm unlucky.
Traveler: Why is staying at someone's home your last choice?
Kaedehara Kazuha: If someone with a blade knocks on the door during a rainy night, most people would be on their guard.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Understanding this, there's no need to bother them. Besides, the world is vast and there is always somewhere to go.
Kaedehara Kazuha: No need for worry. The outdoors won't always be rainy, and one's life won't always be overcast.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Turn your gaze skyward on a clear night, and you will see thousands of stars.
Traveler: Any recommendations for shelter?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm...
