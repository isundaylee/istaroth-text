Ngahue: If you head west along this main road by the edge, you'll end up at the Stadium of the Sacred Flame.

Ngahue: Each of their hobbies seems to be more dangerous than the last...
Ngahue: And then if you keep heading to the place where there's water, you'll reach my home, the People of the Springs.
