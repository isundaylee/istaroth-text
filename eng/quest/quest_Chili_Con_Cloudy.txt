# Chili Con Cloudy


## Talk 1

Wenhua: Dear passersby, could you please help a poor old man?
Traveler: What's the matter?
Wenhua: My precious Yun has gone missing. I've searched all over for it, but it's nowhere to be found... Well, there's a Treasure Hoarder camp too, but I dare not go there...
Traveler: Yun?
Wenhua: My precious, yes! My Yunyun, a Sumpter Beast by that name!
Paimon: A Sumpter Beast... Huh. So people from Liyue keep those too, do they?
Wenhua: Well, moving large quantities of cargo through the mountains is always a challenge for merchants who run long routes like we do. Cows are too slow, while mules and ponies carry too little, and arranging for food and drink for porters is too expensive...
Wenhua: So I had this idea — what if I simply bought a few Sumpter Beasts of good stock from Sumeru? That way, I'd be able to transport goods in bulk without worry!
Wenhua: I didn't think that someone would just... steal my Sumpter Beast just as I entered Chenyu Vale! Ah... My Yun! My Mora!
Paimon: Err, d—don't cry! You're a grown man, y'know?
Traveler: Did you really save any money by not renting mules...?
Wenhua: You can't calculate it so simply. Look, the Sumpter Beasts I bought come in a group, and they're of good stock, too. As long as I'm successful in breeding them, I've no doubt that they'll have adapted to Liyue's environment in two to three generations.
Wenhua: Hehe, and once those two to three generations have passed, I'll rent my grown Sumpter Beasts out or sell them off — that's how I'll recoup all my costs!
Wenhua: *sigh* But right now, as you can see... Ah, what a loss! My Yun...
Wenhua: I bought these three precious Sumpter Beasts, and it was such an effort, too... Never mind how I feel about them...
Wenhua: Chili has always been the most obedient, and it's been here all this time. Jue was very mischievous, and ran off long ago.
Wenhua: If even Yun should leave me... It would be a loss I could never, ever recover from!
Paimon: Ah... Well, the remaining Sumpter Beast definitely seems to be having a hard time. All alone, without any companions...
Wenhua: Surely, you two kind souls will help me, right? I've been wallowing here in my trouble for half the day, and only you two have paid me any mind...
Traveler: Actually, we're just passing through, too...
Wenhua: What?
Wenhua: Ah! Right, I understand... Don't worry, I know the rules. Rest assured, you need not worry about compensation.
Wenhua: Should we go now, in that case? I worry for what the Treasure Hoarders might have done to Yun!
Traveler: Well then, where's their camp?
Wenhua: Hah, allow me to lead the way!
Traveler: Well, you look like you need help, so we're to provide it.
Paimon: Yeah, we couldn't just leave you sitting there being all sad like that!
Wenhua: Ah, you are... truly heroes imbued with chivalrous spirits, and good souls besides! Such fine people you are!
Wenhua: Well... I know where the Treasure Hoarder camp is. Allow me to lead the way, and then you can teach them a bit of a lesson!
Wenhua: Should we go now, in that case? I worry for what the Treasure Hoarders might have done to Yun!
Traveler: Well then, where's their camp?
Wenhua: Allow me to lead the way!
Traveler: Can you give us any leads?
Wenhua: Well, this... I don't... Actually, wait! I did say earlier that there was a Treasure Hoarder camp nearby, right? Yun's disappearance must have something to do with them!
Wenhua: Those crooks have been active in this area all this time. If I hadn't spent all the funds allocated for guards on the Sumpter Beasts, then maybe... *sigh*
Wenhua: As their name would suggest, they steal treasures, don't they? Well, then, I think they were the ones who stole Yun!

## Talk 2

Wenhua: Yun! My Yun! I've come to take you home!
Traveler: Yun?
Wenhua: It's my precious, my baby Yunyun, stolen by these Treasure Hoarders!
Wenhua: I've been a merchant for many years, and all my savings went into my three precious Sumpter Beasts. Chili is the most obedient and has always stayed with me. Jue, the most mischievous, ran off a long time ago...
Wenhua: If even Yun should leave me... Ah, that would be tragedy unbearable! Thank you, good folk, truly!
Wenhua: You must've suffered, haven't you? I've brought you your favorite Jueyun Chilis! Come, come, have some!
Wenhua: Hmm? You're not eating them anymore, Yun? ...Have you learned the wrong lessons while you've been out and about? Come on, eat!
Paimon: Uh, do Sumpter Beasts even eat Jueyun Chilis?
Wenhua: That's what I've been feeding Yun this whole time! Surely I know what it likes!
Tusheng: You're a disgrace, old man... Don't you know that Sumpter Beasts like eating fruit?
Tusheng: Unless they're practically starving, they won't eat Jueyun Chilis — that stuff's bad for their health.
Paimon: Huh? And who in the world are you?
Traveler: A wild Treasure Hoarder appeared!
Paimon: Huh, and here Paimon thought that it might be someone actually important...
Wenhua: Well, either way, Yun's back with us, so let's head back...
Tusheng: Hey! Don't you ignore me!
Wenhua: Hmph, alright... you thief.
Wenhua: Your comrades have all been brought to justice, but still, you dare to say this and that about my precious...
Wenhua: "Say"? I'll give you "say." Gainsay, soothsay, hearsay, assay, naysay...
Traveler: Uh, where's this coming from...
Wenhua: ...Essay, unsay...
Traveler: Alright, you can stop now!
Paimon: That's right! You, too, calm down! Let's hear them out — we can decide what to do later.
Tusheng: Pfft, a crook, he says... Your Sumpter Beast ran to us of its own accord... The rest locked it up, but I've been taking care of it this whole time.
Tusheng: Tusheng's the name. Yes, meaning "local-born," because that's exactly what I am.
Tusheng: As for why I know this and that about Sumpter Beasts, that's because I used to work for a caravan in Sumeru. I came to the Treasure Hoarders because they offered better pay... Pah. Didn't think things would get this dangerous.
Tusheng: Anyway, your Sumpter Beast... It ate all the Berries I spent three days picking. It must've been starving.
Paimon: Huh, so it was hungry... That would explain why it ran off...
Wenhua: What nonsense! This crook lies! Isn't Chili by my side still?
Traveler: Well, you do have a point there...
Tusheng: You have another Sumpter Beast? It comes from good stock, I presume? That's to say, a good breed?
Wenhua: Of course! Hmph... Why do you ask?
Tusheng: Sumpter Beasts of good breeds can go a long time without eating or drinking, which is what makes them excellent for long-distance transport through both desert and rainforest. *sigh* It's just a shame that some people are willing to spend so much Mora on buying them, but not on caring for them...
Wenhua: Who're you talking about, huh? What do you mean, "not on caring for them"? So you're an expert, is that it? After studying Sumpter Beasts for just a couple days? Huh?
Tusheng: I haven't formally studied, no, but I have fed Sumpter Beasts.
Tusheng: Anyway, Yunyun over here's been living good these past few days, so don't feed it anything weird from now on, alright?
Wenhua: You... Cutpurse cretin! Scurrilous slanderer! Well then, if you say Yun's been living well, why don't we have a showdown between it and Chili, then?
Paimon: Huh? A competition... how, exactly?
Wenhua: We'll take them out on a walk, and see which one is in higher spirits! If Chili has a spring in its step, that's how we'll know that this person's been putting Yun through the wringer!
Paimon: We saw Yun break through the fence earlier — it sure looked pretty lively then. It must've eaten pretty well, right?
Traveler: Well, someone's being unnecessarily competitive...
Tusheng: Hmph! Who's afraid of you, anyway?
Wenhua: Fine! Don't you dare leave — come to my camp. That's where Chili is. We'll have it out there!
Traveler: And didn't you have another Sumpter Beast up and leave on you...?
Wenhua: Jue... Do you mean Jue left because it was hungry? Impossible! Impossible!
Tusheng: And why would it be impossible? Even people hate places where there isn't enough to eat.
Traveler: Let's just hear what our thieving friend has to... say.
Wenhua: S—S—Say... Hmph! Fine, as you wish! Spit it out, you crook!
Traveler: Eek! A wild Treasure Hoarder appeared!
Paimon: Whoa, so spooky!
Wenhua: So sneaky!
Yunyun: Moo!
Tusheng: Oi! Quit making mountains out of molehills, you!

## Talk 4

Wenhua: Yun! My Yun! I've come to take you home!
Wenhua: You must've suffered, haven't you? I've brought you your favorite Jueyun Chilis! Come, come, have a bite!
Wenhua: Hmm? You're not eating them anymore, Yun? ...Have you learned the wrong lessons while you've been out and about? Come on, eat!

Wenhua: So sneaky!
Yunyun: Moo!
Tusheng: Oi! Quit making mountains out of molehills, you!

## Talk 5

Wenhua: See? Chili's doing great! And on the other hand... Yun's doing so poorly it breaks my heart.
Tusheng: Are you sure your eyes are working right, old man? Isn't it the other way around?
Paimon: Uhh... Y'know, Paimon can't really tell either way. They just look pretty similar. Maybe we'll need them to walk around a bit to tell.
Wenhua: Please, could the two of you be our referees? I'm sure you'll be impartial.
Paimon: And what are the rules, exactly?
Wenhua: We'll just see who gets to the finish line first — Yun, or Chili! I'll have my assistant wait at the finish line.
Wenhua: You can go over there now, Mingli.
Mingli: Yes, Boss.
Tusheng: Old man, don't you think you're too tough on the Sumpter Beasts? Especially that Chili of yours, it looks super hungry.
Wenhua: Hahaha! Scared, young one? Making excuses, are we?
Tusheng: What slander. I'm only being considerate! Fine, let's compete! I ain't afraid of you none!
Wenhua: Heh, let's begin then. I'm about to teach you a good lesson.
Mingli: Boss, we can start now!
Wenhua: Okay, begin!

## Talk 6

Wenhua: Chili, why aren't you moving either? Do you want some Jueyun Chilis?
Wenhua: Come, come, I've got lots of them here. You can eat all you want today!
Wenhua: That way, you'll have the energy to compete!
Chili Pepper: (Chili Pepper seems to know what Wenhua's bringing and doesn't even look at it.)
Wenhua: This... What's going on? Why aren't you eating anymore?

## Talk 7

Tusheng: Hey now, come on, didn't you just eat? Are you hungry already?
Tusheng: *sigh* What am I supposed to do with you? ... Well, we're fresh out of Berries, but we've still got some Sunsettias. Here, I suppose you'll enjoy these too?
Black Screen Text: Tusheng retrieves a pile of Sunsettias and places them on the ground.
Yunyun: (Yunyun starts to eat...)
Paimon: Look! Chili Pepper's joining in, too! Guess it wants in on those Sunsettias, huh?
Wenhua: Chili! Not you too...
Tusheng: See, I told you so. You're the only one who's enamored with the idea of them liking Jueyun Chilis.
Wenhua: How could this be...
Tusheng: Whatever. There's nothing to be said to people like you. We can compete once they're done eating their fill.
Wenhua: ...Ah, forget it... *sigh*
Wenhua: I get it. There's no need for competition now... I know I've lost.
Tusheng: Huh?
Wenhua: Perhaps I was too overconfident... But I'm not some bull-headed old fogey!
Wenhua: You win, youngster. Looks like Yun and Chili have grown up. If they don't wish to eat Jueyun Chilis any longer, then I'll let them be...
Paimon: Paimon thinks they never did in the first place...
Tusheng: Hmm. You know what, old man, you've surprised me... Guess you're pretty alright, learning from your errors and all.
Wenhua: ...Youngster, could I ask you a question? How are you so familiar with Sumpter Beast habits?
Tusheng: Well, I just like little critters, and Sumpter Beasts are pretty cute when they're young. My family wasn't well-to-do, though, so I couldn't afford to have one.
Paimon: And that's how you came to steal Yun together with the Treasure Hoarders?
Tusheng: Hey, I told you, this one came to us. I stole nothing!
Tusheng: Our superiors said that it was just as well that we had a Sumpter Beast, since we got a big deal going recently and would have to transport some large goods — and that's how we came to keep it at our camp.
Wenhua: Hmph. Even so, taking it for yourself... That's just not right!
Tusheng: Well, how were we supposed to know that someone would be raising Sumpter Beasts out here in the boonies!? If we knew we'd end up facing off with this tough a customer, we'd have returned it to you right away!
Traveler: So you wouldn't have returned it so easily had it not been for us, I take it?
Wenhua: I see, I see... Well. It's not too late to make up for past mistakes! Well, youngster, ever considered switching careers to work in a caravan?
Tusheng: What? I'm not sure I'll have squarer meals with you...
Wenhua: Square meals? You? Hahaha... You want to eat your fill, do you? Hahaha!
Tusheng: ...
Wenhua: Look. Everyone here can attest to you being a Treasure Hoarder, a member of a criminal organization! A single document submitted by me to the Millelith captains, and you'll be eating your fill in a prison cell.
Wenhua: But see, I'm a kind soul. Not only am I erasing any record of your guilt, but I'm going to offer you a job, food, and board. What do you say?
Tusheng: And how much will I make?
Wenhua: Ah? Wages... Wages... Well, you can ask the Millelith about that!
Tusheng: W—Wait! Please, don't! ... Ugh. You can just decide my paycheck for yourself, alright?
Wenhua: Hmm. Well, in any case, you've impressed me with your abilities. In future, my Sumpter Beasts shall be in your care.
Wenhua: I guarantee that not only will you be able to fill your stomach, but that your talents will see ample use indeed!
Paimon: Wow, uh, this is the first time Paimon's ever seen someone taking advantage of a Treasure Hoarder this much!
Traveler: I suppose you could call this a way out of this life...
Tusheng: You think so too? Well... To be honest, I quite like the idea of spending time with the Sumpter Beasts...
Tusheng: Let me give it some thought. I'll let you know once I've thought it through.
Wenhua: I believe you'll make the right decision, young man.
Wenhua: (I need to find someone to keep an eye on him!)
Wenhua: Good, good! Anyway, my good fellows, thank you for helping me reclaim my precious Yun, and bringing it to my attention that they do not like Jueyun Chilis... *sigh* Sorry for the trouble, truly!
Wenhua: So please, take this as a token of my appreciation. 'Twould be a shame if fine young folks such as yourselves could not eat as they pleased every day!
Traveler: Well, it's better than going to jail.

## Additional Conversations

### Additional Talk 1

Mingli: Hello there. I'm Mingli, the boss's assistant.
Paimon: Why the long face?
Mingli: I'm worried about my boss... He lost yet another Sumpter Beast... We had three in total, but now we're just down to one!
Mingli: Sumpter Beasts are quite expensive, and neither my boss nor I know much about keeping them. We're going to take big losses if we keep going like this.
Mingli: Do you guys think he's getting old and starting to forget things?

### Additional Talk 2

Mingli: It's not over yet? Did something unexpected happen?
Traveler: It's over.
Mingli: Huh!? Did Boss forget that I'm waiting at the end!? Is his age finally catching up with him...
Mingli: Perhaps it's time for me to start looking at other options...
