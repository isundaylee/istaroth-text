Nana: Penny, my dear, you shall have two new friends.
Don Quijano: #The legendary adventurer duo, {NICKNAME} and Paimon, are willing to be our friends.
Penny: Really? Haha, awesome! I have so many friends now!
Nana: Let's have a ceremony to commemorate this.
Don Quijano: The ceremony requires a speech. But alas! We lack the time to write a proper one.
Nana: Don't worry. Just keep it simple.
Don Quijano: Very well, then I shall make this brief. Please, come forward.
Paimon: This should do it.
Don Quijano: Ladies and gentlemen, I hereby declare...
Don Quijano: Penny, friend to the children, Don Quijano the Swashbuckler, and Lady Nana, hereby welcome Paimon and...
Don Quijano: Ah, just a moment. How should I introduce you two?
Paimon: You mean Paimon's title? You can call Paimon the Best Guide in Teyvat!
Paimon: #And let's use Honorary Knight of the Knights of Favonius for {M#him}{F#her}, though {M#his}{F#her} other titles are awesome too.
Penny: No, no, no. That's not what Mr. Quijano is asking.
Nana: We need to know who your friends are.
Don Quijano: Every one of us, cats and dogs, are bound together by the bonds of friendship.
Nana: A life bereft of friendship... Oh! Such a life would be too horrible. So, who are your friends?
Traveler: A deity that oversees a whole nation.
Don Quijano: Good. Penny always brings delicious food. And so, she is also a deity. The Goddess of Biscuits and Bones.
Nana: Then, my dear friends, from now on, you shall have one more deity friend.
Don Quijano: Good. In the name of all the bearings, cakes, and storybooks—
Don Quijano: #Penny, Paimon, and {NICKNAME} are now good friends.
Don Quijano: You will share all your bones, biscuits, and picture books, and say "good night" to each other before you go to sleep.

Penny: Woohoo!
Paimon: Woohoo!
Traveler: Woohoo!
Penny: Now, we're all friends... But wait, the two of you haven't met the children yet.
Don Quijano: Gosh! We almost forgot the children.
Nana: Strange. I haven't seen them all day.
Penny: The children are our friends, too. You two should meet them.
Nana: You're right. Please go meet the children. Let them know you are their new friends.
Don Quijano: They probably went somewhere far away to play. It's high time they returned. Go into the water and have a look.
Penny: Don't worry, just go underwater. You needn't fret about the children not wanting to come back. I'll sing a song to send you along.
Penny: The children will come back to sleep in their big shells when they hear my song, so head over to the big shell and wish them sweet dreams.
Traveler: Government officials and wealthy people.
Nana: Oh, deary me! Those are the only friends you have? It's okay. You have us now.

Paimon: You are also Paimon's best friend!
Don Quijano: Aha! So you are a pair of good friends. Wonderful!
Nana: I can see that Paimon is a truly great friend!
