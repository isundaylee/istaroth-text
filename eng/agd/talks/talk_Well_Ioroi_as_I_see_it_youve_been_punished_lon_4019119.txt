Yae Miko: Well, Ioroi, as I see it, you've been punished long enough. It's about time you were released...
Ioroi: R—R—Released!? I can do that myself any time I want! This statue keeps me warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Don't interfere!
Kinkaku (Kinkaku, Ginkaku, and Tetsunosuke): Ioroi is the best!
Ginkaku (Kinkaku, Ginkaku, and Tetsunosuke): Ioroi is the best!
Tetsunosuke (Kinkaku, Ginkaku, and Tetsunosuke): Ioroi is the best!
Ioroi: ...Besides, the seal's power is almost gone... What I really want is for you to help me give that sneaky kitsune a piece of my mind!
Yae Miko: ...Ioroi, she's already—
Ioroi: Not so fast! I won't be fooled by your tricks again! Whatever you were about to say, she can tell me herself, instead of sending some young kitsune to hoodwink me!
