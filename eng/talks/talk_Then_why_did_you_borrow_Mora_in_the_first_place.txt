Traveler: Then why did you borrow Mora in the first place?
Brek: I was in dire need of Mora for my business at the time, but no one was willing to lend me a cent. I had no choice but to approach that bunch of crooks for a small loan.
Brek: It doesn't matter now anyway. Once I get my hands on that thing and send it out, all of this will be settled.
