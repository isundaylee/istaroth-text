Traveler: How have you been lately?
Nizami: Quite well! Apart from the fact I have nothing to do... I go and spar with Roussimoff now and then, to stay active. But it's not enough!
Nizami: But you, fighting with you is exciting. Especially when I lose.
Nizami: Losing shows me where my weaknesses are, and that means I know how to keep getting stronger. Losing is to win, too. Makes sense, no?
