Traveler: Tell me a bit about yourself, if you would...
Kiyoko: I'm a merchant who came to Watatsumi Island specifically to do business. I provide high-quality, low-cost goods.
Kiyoko: You've seen how things are around here. The village is small, the villagers lead rather limited existences, and they still need to receive those soldiers...
Kiyoko: *cough* It's not that I'm looking down on this place. In fact, it's precisely because it's lacking development that it needs our help, right?
Kiyoko: So that's why I decided to stay here for good and provide goods at an affordable asking, such that the inhabitants of this island will never lack daily necessities.
