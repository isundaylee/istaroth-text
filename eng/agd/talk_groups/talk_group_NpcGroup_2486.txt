Hermanson: Liyue tea is great, but it's hard to brew, and that's a headache for those who just want a quick drink.

Traveler: Have any suggestions?
Hermanson: Hah, I have an idea!
Hermanson: We'll break the leaves up into smaller pieces, then put them in a cloth or paper bag.
Hermanson: And when you want tea, you can just put the bag in a cup and add water.
Hermanson: You can even separate the tea leaves and the tea immediately after making it. Not bad, right?
Hermanson: Once I return to Fontaine after this deal, I'm going to put my invention into production right away.
Hermanson: People in my line of work always have a lot of ideas, but I can't let them have this one.

Traveler: Speed really isn't the goal when drinking tea, is it?
Hermanson: I've been doing business in Yilong Wharf for a decade, and I realized something...
Hermanson: Not everyone knows how to appreciate tea. Some aren't particular about the flavor.
Hermanson: It's unrealistic to ask them to spend a ton of time studying how to properly make the stuff. They'd find the step you need to wash the residue troublesome alone, to say nothing of the whole process.
Hermanson: My tea bags are only for those who're looking for a quick cup. The traditionalists can still make tea the old-fashioned way. No one will be hurt!

Traveler: Does this count as drinking tea?
Hermanson: Frankly speaking, this may not be the best way for those who are serious about tea.
Hermanson: After all, the cloth and the paper bags will carry flavor all their own, which might affect the flavor of the tea in turn.
Hermanson: Grinding the tea leaves too finely might also have an impact on the flavor.
Hermanson: We'll just have to keep trying to improve the paper or the cloth bags to minimize the aforementioned influence they might have.
