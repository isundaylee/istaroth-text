Traveler: About Hilichurlian...
Ella Musk: Oh, are you interested in these things as well?

Traveler: Come again?
Ella Musk: ...Hmm? Oh— Sorry, I was off in my own world.
Ella Musk: That was Hilichurlian for "Hello there! Have you eaten?"
Traveler: Why does it sound so hostile?
Ella Musk: Are you questioning my academic credentials!?
Ella Musk: Hmph... Well, I suppose that's not unusual. Hilichurlian Linguistics is severely underdeveloped as an academic discipline, so I still have a lot of questions regarding the exact meaning of certain words...

Ella Musk: But our methodologies differ. What I'm studying is living hilichurls, while she seems more interested in their bones.

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Ella Musk: Hmm... Speaking of which, might you happen to know how dragons interact with one another?
Ella Musk: Ugh, my curiosity's getting the better of me again, but what does the dragon language sound like? Do dragons sing songs and write essays?
Ella Musk: Admittedly, I have never seen a dragon other than Dvalin. If only I could find a research subject...
