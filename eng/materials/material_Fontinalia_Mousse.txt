# Fontinalia Mousse

A true blue Fontinalia Festival snack. This mousse is shaped in the image of the Lakelight Lily's bud. After the Festival's customs were changed to align more with dessert delectation, it quickly came to be a much-favored Fontainian food favorite. Don't forget to share them with all the trial-or-treaters who come your way!
