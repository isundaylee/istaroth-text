# Mystery of the Arcadian Ruins


## Talk 1

Paimon: ...

## Talk 2

Vile: Why is this happening to me? I shouldn't have helped <color=#00E1FFFF>him</color>...
Paimon: Him, who?
Vile: Thanks so much for saving me! You're far more reliable than those Favonius guys.
Paimon: #It's nothing. {M#He}{F#She}'s a traveler, {M#he}{F#she} has to deal with stuff like this all the time.
Vile: Traveler? I've heard stories about you. I didn't think I'd be saved by <color=#00E1FFFF>the one I'm here to meet</color>.
Paimon: Oh, so you're the...
Vile: Hahaha... I didn't know how I could pay you back initially, but now, I think I'll just give you the intel for free.
Vile: People in our circle know how important the network is.
Traveler: Really?
Vile: Well, you did save my life.
Paimon: LUCKY!
Paimon: But... it's lucky for Kaeya, isn't it? He's supposed to pay for the intel...
Vile: Listen well then, the intel on the Arcadian Ruins...
Vile: "Three six-armed giants reside in the city in the lake. Two guard the statue, one, the treasure."
Paimon: Right... Wait, is that it?
Vile: There's also this map that came with it.
Paimon: Could... this be the X-marks-the-spot?
Paimon: So the clue is more like a riddle...
Paimon: #Well, should be a piece of cake for ya, right {NICKNAME}? Paimon'll leave it to you then!
Traveler: Sure thing.
Paimon: Well, if you can't solve it, we can ask Kaeya. He seems like a nerd too.
Vile: I'll leave you the intel so you can review it at any time.
Paimon: Thanks, Vile.
Paimon: "Three six-armed giants reside in the city in the lake. Two guard the statue, one, the treasure."
Paimon: What does that mean? If you don't wanna ask Kaeya, you better figure it out!
Traveler: Sure... I hope.
Traveler: Thank you, friend.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Ooh, lemme see what's inside!
Paimon: "She doesn't love him at all. The passion rushing through the clear spring is just a front. When she's cold and alone, her true heart is revealed."
Paimon: There's another map.
Paimon: More riddles?
Paimon: Paimon's dizzy already. Oh, no! Paimon used up all her brain juice!
Traveler: You never had any to begin with...
Paimon: Paimon'll let you have all the fun. Or, you could get Kaeya to help.

## Talk 4

Kaeya: Take a look around the waterfall near Springvale. Remember to bring a friend who can manipulate Cryo. Huh? Oh... Me?

## Talk 5

Kaeya: #{NICKNAME}! You're back! Looks like you got the intel.
Paimon: Yes and no. It's a lot more complicated than that.
Paimon: "Three six-armed giants reside in the city in the lake. Two guard the statue, one, the treasure." What do you make of it?
Kaeya: Riddles? How quaint. Let me think...
Kaeya: "City in the lake" is clearly Mondstadt... As for the Six-Armed Giants... Hmm...
Traveler: Crabs?
Paimon: Giant crabs!
Kaeya: Aside from asking just where we would find giant crabs...
Kaeya: Crabs have eight legs, not six...
Traveler: The windmills, then?
Traveler: Should be... the windmills?
Kaeya: Hey! That's smart!
Kaeya: A windmill has six blades... It fits.
Paimon: Wow! That makes sense!
Kaeya: So, out of the three windmills, two are close to the statue...
Kaeya: The other one is guarding...
Paimon: Ooh! Ooh! This one Paimon knows! The treasure!
Kaeya: Hehehe... Let's hope it's really that simple.
Paimon: #Come on, {NICKNAME}! Let's go take a look around that windmill!

## Talk 6

Kaeya: The location is in the Whispering Woods â€” you haven't forgotten, right?

## Talk 7

Kaeya: "She doesn't love him at all. The passion rushing through the clear spring is just a front. When she's cold and alone, her true heart is revealed."
Paimon: Any idea what that means?
Kaeya: Is this some page stripped from a love novel that you just happened to find?
Paimon: Oh, so it's not a clue. No wonder someone as clever as Paimon wasn't able to get it.
Kaeya: Hahaha... I'm just joking.
Paimon: Hmph... Take this more seriously, Kaeya!
Kaeya: Haha, this riddle is hard to figure out. Clear spring... Is it referring to Springvale?
Traveler: Maybe when there are people bathing in the spring water?
Traveler: When the water level changes?
Kaeya: "Passion rushing through the clear spring..." So when does passion rush through a clear spring?
Kaeya: Such inappropriate behavior... I feel like it has been creeping into Mondstadt for quite a while now.
Kaeya: Unless... that's something you two get up to?
Kaeya: Oh, my apologies. I shouldn't judge what one does in their own time.
Paimon: What's wrong with you? What kind of people do you think we are?
Traveler: Hmm... Maybe it's when the water level of the clear spring changes?
Kaeya: Haha. The thing is, if the "rushing passion" isn't coming from the clear spring, then it's coming from the people bathing.
Kaeya: Not a bad idea! Like when... there's a waterfall, for example...
Kaeya: It appears the solution to this enigma relates to the waterfall behind Springvale.
Kaeya: Only the clear spring that blesses Mondstadt can reveal the passion described here.
Kaeya: And the "heart" of the waterfall must refer to the cliff on the left side of the waterfall. I noticed it once when I was out on patrol in the area.
Kaeya: The ending, "cold and alone," probably has something to do with Cryo, which can be controlled by a Vision.
Traveler: Thanks for the help, Kaeya.
Kaeya: You should probably <color=#00E1FFFF>take someone who can manipulate Cryo with you</color>.
Kaeya: It's nothing. If a Knight of Favonius couldn't even answer a riddle, how could we be trusted to solve criminal mysteries?
Paimon: Let's go take a look in Springvale. We'll leave you to your "criminal mysteries"!
Kaeya: Erm...
Paimon: No, wait... Leave you to SOLVING your criminal mysteries!

## Talk 8

Kaeya: If I'm right, the location described by the clue is the windmill the furthest away from the statue... I'm not completely certain though.
