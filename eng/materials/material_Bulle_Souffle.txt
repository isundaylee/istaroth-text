# Bulle Souffle

A very small cake nestled within a Bulle Fruit skin. Pour the beaten egg whites into a Bulle Fruit skin that has been scraped empty, and bake it until the souffle has evenly expanded. The word "Bulle" isn't a part of the name just because it's in the ingredient list, but because the finished product allows the tongue to delight in bubble-like spongy softness.
