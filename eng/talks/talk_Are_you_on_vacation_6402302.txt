Traveler: Are you on vacation?
Shams: Bingo â€” warm sunlight, tasty food, and an endless supply of time!
Shams: Haha, don't misunderstand me, I'm no hedonist. It's just that I finished up a big job, and now I happen to be enjoying my holiday.
Shams: It wasn't easy going to Inazuma to do business during the Sakoku Decree... *sigh* But that's all in the past now. No point in dwelling on it.
Shams: Anyway, after wrapping up that big one, I can finally take it easy for a while.
