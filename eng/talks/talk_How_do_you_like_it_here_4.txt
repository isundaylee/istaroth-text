Traveler: How do you like it here?
Kuki Shinobu: It's pretty nice. Thanks for the invite.
Kuki Shinobu: I just did a few laps of the place. The general layout's really quite interesting. Did you study landscape design?

Traveler: Why not? Go for it!
Kuki Shinobu: Wow, I like the enthusiasm, haha. Thanks for the support.

Traveler: I know a thing or two. You've studied it, too?
Kuki Shinobu: Actually, no, I haven't...
