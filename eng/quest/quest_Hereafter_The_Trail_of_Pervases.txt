# Hereafter: The Trail of Pervases


## Talk 1

Chef Mao: What would you two like?
Traveler: Three servings of Grilled Tiger Fish to go, please.
Chef Mao: You got it! Hang on for a moment, they'll be ready soon!
Paimon: Three servings? One for you, one for Paimon... Who's the last one for?
Traveler: I was thinking we could go see Pervases.
Paimon: You mean gave-us-the-Seven-Star-Lamps-and-Censer Pervases?
Paimon: Huh, that's right. He did say that he missed the taste of Grilled Tiger Fish...
Paimon: But isn't he gone now?
Traveler: Even so, we can still pay our respects.
Paimon: Yeah, that makes sense. Let's go see him, then!
Paimon: The last time that we met Pervases there, the temple was in a pretty sad state, and there were Treasure Hoarders in the area, too...
Paimon: Let's hope that his statue hasn't been defaced...
Chef Mao: Your three servings of Grilled Tiger Fish. Hold on to them, now!
Paimon: #Ooh, these smell so nice! C'mon, Traveler. Off to our next stop!
Traveler: Pervases loves Grilled Tiger Fish.

## Talk 2

Xiao: Why are you here?
Traveler: Are you here to see Pervases as well?
Xiao: I was just passing through.
Xiao: What are you two here for?
Paimon: We're here to see Pervases!
Paimon: ...Aw, but this place is in as much of a mess as last time...
Paimon: There's a temple here, and a statue, too... Why doesn't anyone come to maintain this place?
Traveler: Perhaps this place has been forgotten.
Paimon: How could people forget something like this? The Yakshas are heroes who defended Liyue Harbor...
Xiao: ...
Paimon: Xiao, are... are you angry?
Xiao: No. The Yakshas did not perform their duty for any form of recognition.
Paimon: ...Eh, let's not talk about this stuff right now. Grilled Tiger Fish first!
Paimon: Uh, and if you wanna have some, Xiao, we can give you half of our share each.
Xiao: It's fine...
Wang Ping'an (???): Help! Help me!
Paimon: Huh? Did you hear that?
Xiao: There. Someone's calling for help.
Traveler: Let's go!
Paimon: Eh!? What about the Grilled Tiger Fish? Paimon hasn't eaten yet!

## Talk 3

Wang Ping'an: Thank you, O mighty adeptus, thank you, mighty hero! ...Oh, what are the odds? We meet again.
Paimon: You know us?
Wang Ping'an: How could I forget you...
Traveler: You're...
Wang Ping'an: I'm Wang Ping'an! Don't you remember me?
Traveler: Ah, "Starsnatcher"?
Wang Ping'an: Huh!? What? What "Starsnatcher"? ...Please, lâ€”let's not bring that up, not in front of the adeptus...
Wang Ping'an: I was just getting ready to make an offering at the temple of the Yaksha, Pervases.
Wang Ping'an: But not long after I entered the mountains, I was set upon by those Treasure Hoarders... Thank you for saving me...
Paimon: Wait a moment. What were you going to do at Pervases' temple?
Paimon: Were you planning to do something bad to his statue?
Wang Ping'an: No, no! I wouldn't dream of it!
Traveler: Then what were you planning to do?
Wang Ping'an: I... I wanted to restore the temple.
Wang Ping'an: My plan today was to closely examine the temple's current condition and arrange for the purchase of the appropriate materials.
Wang Ping'an: I never expected to be targeted halfway by Treasure Hoarders and forced to flee.
Wang Ping'an: But as I ran, I... lost my way. As for the rest, you know what happened.
Traveler: Let's speak further at the temple.
Wang Ping'an: Right, this is hardly the place for conversation. Let's go to the temple first.
Wang Ping'an: We'll speak there.
Xiao: Go. I have other things to handle.
Paimon: Eh? You're leaving already?
Paimon: ...And he's gone.
Traveler: Yeah, I remember you.
Wang Ping'an: Ah, good, good.

## Talk 4

Wang Ping'an: This temple is in a terrible state...
Paimon: Alright, mister, where did you suddenly get the idea to come and fix this temple?
Wang Ping'an: Heh... Well, that's a long story...
Wang Ping'an: Back when I was pretending to be an adeptus, I gathered a lot of resources to help me keep up the act...
Wang Ping'an: But remember how I swore to do good after that adeptus taught me a lesson? Well, after I returned, I was planning to destroy all those materials of mine.
Wang Ping'an: But then I had a thought... Rather than destroying all this information, wouldn't it be better to write up my code of charlatanry and share it with others?
Wang Ping'an: That way, I can help others to see through scams and cheaters...
Wang Ping'an: To my surprise, the guidebook I wrote proved helpful to a lot of people. Even the Ministry of Civil Affairs said that it was very useful.
Wang Ping'an: They even provided me with some additional scam countermeasures to add to the stuff that I'd written myself...
Wang Ping'an: To that end, they paid me a pretty hefty sum.
Wang Ping'an: Apart from that guidebook, I'm currently planning to write a book about the Vigilant Yaksha.
Wang Ping'an: Its purpose, of course, is to share the stories of the Vigilant Yaksha with as many people as possible.
Wang Ping'an: That way, I'll be able to put the folklore knowledge I possess to good use.
Wang Ping'an: As for this temple to Pervases, I discovered it while I was compiling material for this second book.
Wang Ping'an: I found sources saying that this temple was built by our forebears to remember the Yaksha, Pervases.
Wang Ping'an: But I never expected to find the temple in such a state of disrepair...
Wang Ping'an: When I returned and thought about it, I decided to fund the repair of this temple from my own pocket.
Wang Ping'an: After all, I, too, was guided back to the right path by an adeptus.
Wang Ping'an: I suppose repairing this temple can be considered atonement for my previous wrongdoings.
Paimon: Hmm... sounds genuine enough...
Paimon: #What do you think, Traveler?
Traveler: Sounds kinda genuine.
Wang Ping'an: What do you mean "kinda"? I AM being genuine! One hundred percent genuine!
Wang Ping'an: *sigh* Oh, fine, think whatever you like.
Wang Ping'an: If you don't trust me, then come back once work has started. You'll see.
Traveler: That said, you've tried to fool us before...
Wang Ping'an: But I gave all that up! I'm an upstanding citizen now! Didn't I swear to that before that adeptus?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Wang Ping'an: *sigh* This place really is in a terrible state. The pillars are rotten, the planks are broken. At least the statue's still fine...
Wang Ping'an: Why hasn't anyone come to fix this place...
