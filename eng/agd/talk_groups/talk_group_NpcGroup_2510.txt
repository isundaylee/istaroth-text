Sergeant Lin: The troop adjustments are complete. Lemme check the time of the next shift handoff again...

Traveler: The next shift... handoff?
Sergeant Lin: This is confidential information concerning Millelith defenses, and I'm not at liberty to discuss this.
Sergeant Lin: Still, I do sense that you're as extraordinary as you are upright... You must be someone truly great.
Sergeant Lin: Would you be interested in joining one of our Millelith support units and contributing to the safety and prosperity of Liyue?

Traveler: And you are?
Sergeant Lin: I'm Lin, the Sergeant of Millelith's troops here in Chenyu Vale. I'm in charge of border defense and the defense of Yilong Wharf.
Sergeant Lin: The flow of people here in Yilong Wharf is only a little slower than in Liyue Harbor, but we have a limited number of troops, so things are extremely difficult.
Sergeant Lin: I was sent here because of my youth and high stamina, which are required for the heavy workload here.
Sergeant Lin: On the other hand, constantly training our young soldiers is also key for our forces to improve continuously.
Sergeant Lin: The border defense of Chenyu Vale and the defense of Yilong Wharf have seen no trouble since I took up the post.

Traveler: What is this place?
Sergeant Lin: This is the headquarters of the Millelith unit in Chenyu Vale.
Sergeant Lin: It would be foolish to expose ourselves, so we chose an inconspicuous and unused residential building for our use.
Sergeant Lin: The decorations in the yard make it look like just another Secure Transport Agency. Most people who accidentally end up here, like you, have no idea what this building is for.
Sergeant Lin: As for military training... Most soldiers sent here are elites who already have the basics down.
Sergeant Lin: They only need to occasionally train outside the city to maintain their prowess.

Traveler: You can see a person's spirit?
Sergeant Lin: It would be an exaggeration to use the word "see." "Sensing" is more like it.
Sergeant Lin: After all, I'm from the military. I've dealt with plenty of opponents before.
Sergeant Lin: Some were excellent assassins who were good at concealing themselves, not showing their weapons until the very last moment.
Sergeant Lin: I exposed their disguises through the extraordinary presences they had, which they could not quite hide.
Sergeant Lin: And when I fought the ones that could conceal themselves that way... I just had to do my best to block their attacks.
Sergeant Lin: Still, I try to avoid being on the back foot as much as possible.
Sergeant Lin: Anyway, learning to sense these auras is a valuable defensive skill, and the sharper your senses are, the better.
