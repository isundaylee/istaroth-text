# By Thy Pale Beams I Solitary Rove


## Talk 1

Paimon: It's quite tragic that we have to snatch these from Hilichurls (Delete)

## Talk 2

Kujirai Momiji: You found them so quickly? You're a powerful adventurer indeed!
Traveler: Will these be enough?
Kujirai Momiji: Well, watch me next, I just have to do this...this...and this...
Kujirai Momiji: This should be it, that's all.
Paimon: The next step is to scatter the bait and wait for the "Lunar Leviathan" to appear, right?
Kujirai Momiji: Yes, I purposely chose this place, from where we reached the shore back then.
Kujirai Momiji: The "Lunar Leviathan" that guided us back to the ship also disappeared here.
Kujirai Momiji: So, is everyone ready? Don't forget to make a wish when you see the "Lunar Leviathan."
Traveler: What if it doesn't work?
Kujirai Momiji: ...
Kujirai Momiji: Don't say such discouraging things, it will work. The "Lunar Leviathan" will definitely come.
Paimon: Yeah! It will work! Big fish, big fish, you must be good and bite the bait! I'm counting on you!
Kujirai Momiji: Look! Look at this! It's glowing under the water! Something's coming!
Paimon: Really? Is the "Lunar Leviathan" really here?
Paimon: Help, it's a Ruin Guard!
Paimon: Why is it this guy!

## Talk 3

Kujirai Momiji: How...how did this happen, even my father's bait formula didn't work?
Paimon: Don't be sad, it's that Ruin Guard's fault! It must have scared the "Lunar Leviathan" away! Let's try again!
Traveler: Yeah, let's try again.
Kujirai Momiji: ...
Kujirai Momiji: ...
Kujirai Momiji: Let's forget it for now, I'm a little tired. Maybe Nantuck is right?
Kujirai Momiji: *sigh* I want to go and take a stroll outside. I have to think about what happens after this.
Kujirai Momiji: Here's your payment. Whatever the case, thank you very much for your help.
Paimon: Looks like Ms. Kujirai wants to be left alone now, let's come back to see her later.
