Kirara: Hey there! It's good to see you again.
Traveler: About your clothes...
Kirara: Hehe, pretty amazing, right? I never thought I'd be able to keep this outfit in the real world! I really like the texture, too — it feels so nice against my skin. Still, not the best thing to wear when I'm out on a delivery...
Kirara: Something about running around carrying a parcel when I'm dressed like this seems to make everyone suspicious... Especially the Gardes, the Millelith, and so on. They always stop me and interrogate me on the spot.
Kirara: *sigh*... Guess I'll just have to switch back to my old outfit when I'm on the job.
Traveler: About the recent adventure...
Kirara: Oh, it was fantastic! A magical world, full of things I'd never seen before. Great scenery, really friendly people... Oh, and I also took a trip back to the Forest of Blessings after we parted ways.
Kirara: Grandpa Almond introduced me to everyone in the Forest, and reassured them that I wouldn't scratch anything. I made sure to fully retract my claws while I was there — I didn't wanna find out how they'd react to seeing them!
Kirara: Hehe, with this adventure under my belt, I can turn the tables on my grandma — it's my turn to tell her some stories!
Traveler: About your future plans...
Kirara: After peace returned to Simulanka, a lot of people started saying they wanted to pay a visit to the world beyond. But they're a little worried about whether it's safe or not.
Kirara: If any of them do visit Teyvat, I'd love to be their guide. I could even use my delivery box to take them around! If anyone understands the joy of seeing new things, it's me!
Traveler: Let's catch up another time.
Kirara: Sure thing! It's always a pleasure adventuring with you guys. I had so much fun!
