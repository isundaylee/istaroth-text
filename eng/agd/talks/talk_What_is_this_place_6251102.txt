Traveler: What is this place?
Ding Sr.: This is the Qiaoying Village tea workshop. Most of the tea leaves are sent here after being picked.
Ding Sr.: You might not realize that tea leaves require several processes and careful handling before they can be used to make tea.
Ding Sr.: Simply put, we need to remove the excess moisture in the leaves to deepen their fragrance and make them easier to store.
Ding Sr.: Our workshop's in charge of sunning, baking, and then stirring them in a pan.
Ding Sr.: Some types are then taken back by the tea farmers for additional processing, such as piling and fermenting.
Ding Sr.: If you have time, you should stay in the village for a month or so. That way, you can see the full process, from leaf picking to the moment the tea's served up on tables.
