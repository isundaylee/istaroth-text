Traveler: About Anisa...
Kumi: She's... still as reckless as ever...
Kumi: She doesn't seem to act like she's in a different nation at all. She just keeps going to strange and dangerous places every day...
Kumi: And once she gets into her studies, that's the whole day she'll be spending on research I can't make heads or tails out of...
Kumi: She honestly worries me a bit.
Kumi: But she's also very considerate, and her voice is quite lovely. I think I can bear with it, I guess...
Kumi: Um, don't misunderstand, please. She's a good person, so it's not as if I dislike her or something...
