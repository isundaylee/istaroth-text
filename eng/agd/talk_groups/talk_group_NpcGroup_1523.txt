Traveler: How does one become a bard?
Six-Fingered José: Hmm... Well, I became one by trial and error, and a desire to become famous—
Six-Fingered José: Uh, I mean, a desire to bring enjoyment to everyone! Yes, that's why I became a bard.
Six-Fingered José: Why don't you give this book a read first? Maybe you might be able to figure it out yourself.

## Talk

Traveler: Sing for me, José, por favor!
Six-Fingered José: Oh? You want to hear my latest song? I call it Ode to a Morning Breeze.
Six-Fingered José: ...I just need to tune my instrument.
Six-Fingered José: Oh no...
Six-Fingered José: I am so sorry. I have had no audience to play for for so long that now my strings are a little... I'll sing for you next time.

## Talk

Traveler: Are there many other bards in Mondstadt?
Six-Fingered José: #Are you kidding me, amigo? Mondstadt is known all over for its songs from the pastures!
Six-Fingered José: But lately a mysterious bard appeared in this place. I checked all over, but I can't find out anything about him.
Six-Fingered José: Since he came here, my audience has slowly disappeared.
Six-Fingered José: I did consider a battle of the bards...
Six-Fingered José: But I think even I would be seduced by his beautiful voice...

## Talk

Six-Fingered José: #Hey, amigo!
Six-Fingered José: You have a good pair of eyes, choosing to stop here in front of me!
Six-Fingered José: #Do you want to hear my latest composition? I put my whole heart into it, and also my soul. How about it, amigo?

## Talk

Traveler: ...Um, who are you?
Six-Fingered José: You can call me Six-Fingered José, it's okay.
Six-Fingered José: I am a beloved bard of Mondstadt... Or I should say, I used to be beloved.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Six-Fingered José: Leaving so soon? You are a busy bee.
Six-Fingered José: If you ever have time to spare, I won't complain if you come here and show me some appreciation.

## Talk

Traveler: Have you seen anyone around that looks a lot like me?
Six-Fingered José: Someone that looks a lot like you? Is it a relative of yours?
Six-Fingered José: Oh, then may I ask if that person is fond of wine?
Six-Fingered José: If they're out for a drink, then Mondstadt would be the place. And if it's the Mondstadt I know, they'd surely stop by the Angel's Share.
Six-Fingered José: I keep tabs on everyone I see in the Angel's Share. I'm always keeping an eye out for a potential audience, you know.
Six-Fingered José: But if the fellow you're looking for doesn't like to drink, then I'm afraid I don't have any clues for you. Lo siento.

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Six-Fingered José: The days when the dragon was circling the city in the skies... Those were dark days for the people of this city...
Six-Fingered José: But just when the knights thought that all hope was lost, a miracle! A mystery traveler showed up out of nowhere and saved the day!
Six-Fingered José: I have decided to base my latest song on the true story of the mystery traveler of Mondstadt!
Six-Fingered José: Sure, so I added a little extra detail here and there... But that, my friend, is the work of the artist!
Six-Fingered José: With an exciting new story like this to tell, I'm sure to win my audience back!
