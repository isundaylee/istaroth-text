# Talk Dialog

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Ah! I—I'm busted, aren't I... Pl—Please don't tell anyone you saw me here.
Traveler: What's going on here?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): *sigh* Well, I'm just staying here for the time being. My elder brother is a guard here — yes, he's the one guarding the cellar door.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): I want to become a guard like him, but I'm not strong enough yet, so I'm learning in secret here...
Traveler: Why did you have to hide in the cellar?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): I'm not a Night Raven Guard, but I'm in the castle. If I were to be discovered by the other guards, my brother would be in for it...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): So please, don't tell anyone...
Traveler: Alright, you have my word.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Thank you! You are a kind soul indeed!
