# Ending Note


## Talk 1

Jean: This is Barbara, the Deaconess of the Church. She is here to retrieve the Holy Lyre der Himmel.
Barbara: May the Anemo Archon protect you.
Barbara: I'm not really in a position to speak compared to our Acting Grand Master...
Barbara: But I still want to thank you all on behalf of all of Mondstadt for your assistance!
Barbara: Fortunately, everything was resolved peacefully... I can't imagine how an all-out war between the military and the dragon would have ended...
Jean: Now the Fatui have no choice but to keep their mouths shut.
Jean: They must be annoyed that things didn't turn out as planned for them.
Jean: This time, they even lost their best excuse to pressure the Knights of Favonius.
Jean: Diplomatically speaking, they gained nothing, and on the contrary simply proved just how vexatious they can be.
Barbara: Sounds like quite the story. So, did you bring the Holy Lyre with you?
Barbara: We cannot ask you to keep defending the lyre forever. The Seneschal has been pressing me for a while now...
Paimon: We ahh... did bring it with us... Ummm... It's just... it's a little...
Barbara: Oh, don't worry! I'm not here to collect rent! The Church has always received special funding...

## Talk 2

Venti: The wind amongst the branches is good, I love the way it smells...
Venti: Haha, I said the exact same thing the last time. *sigh* Why do I only say these things when I'm down on my luck?
Traveler: So... what is a Gnosis?
Venti: Ah, so you noticed.
Venti: *sigh* This isn't something I'm meant to discuss with ordinary people. But I suppose I can let you in on the secret.
Venti: As you know, Visions are external magical foci that only a small minority of people possess. They use these Visions to channel elemental power.
Venti: In truth, every wielder of a Vision is one who can attain godhood and ascend to Celestia. We call such people allogenes.
Paimon: Allogenes? Paimon's never heard of them before.
Venti: Hehe, that's because this is a secret that only archons are privy to. We don't need primitive tools like Visions.
Venti: Instead, each archon has an internal magical focus that resonates directly with Celestia itself... known as a Gnosis.
Traveler: What about the thing hanging off your hip?
Venti: Eh-he. It's just a glowing glass ball I carry around to avoid suspicion.
Traveler: Huh...
Paimon: So who was that nasty woman who sent Paimon flying and stole your Gnosis?
Venti: Her name is Signora, No. 8 of the harbingers.
Venti: She and the rest of the harbingers have been given god-like executive authority by the Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya, and with it, strength surpassing that of other mortals.
Paimon: The Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya? Isn't that...
Venti: Indeed. She is one of The Seven, the Tsaritsa who reigns from the Zapolyarny Palace, and the one person that the Fatui Harbingers all answer to.
Venti: The Seven don't always get along well, but still — I never thought that she would plot to steal another archon's Gnosis...
Traveler: What sort of god is the Tsaritsa?
Venti: Ah... How should I put this?
Venti: Five hundred years ago, I knew her well. But I can't say the same is true now.
Venti: You see, a certain catastrophe happened five hundred years ago, and after that, she cut off all ties with me.
Venti: But we can save discussion of the Cryo Archon and the Fatui for another day.
Venti: #Traveler, if you seek the rest of The Seven, many difficulties lie ahead of you still.
Venti: You should head for Mondstadt's neighboring nation of Liyue. The Geo Archon who reigns there, unlike me, administrates his entire region personally.
Venti: He only descends once every year to give his divine predictions, which set the direction for Liyue for the rest of that year.
Paimon: Even so, it sounds like he works much harder than a certain someone.
Venti: Eh-he?
Venti: ...In any case, this year's Rite of Descension is soon to begin. If you miss it, you'll just have to wait another year.
Paimon: #WHAT!? Why didn't you tell us before? Well then bye. Traveler, we're going!
Venti: One moment, Windborne Outlander.
Traveler: You mean me?
Venti: Yup.
Venti: Traveler, as you set off on your journey once again, you must remember that the journey itself has meaning.
Venti: The birds of Teyvat, the songs and the cities, the Tsaritsa, her Fatui and the monsters... they are all part of your journey.
Venti: The destination is not everything. So before you reach the end, keep your eyes open. Use the chance to take in the world around you...
Traveler: Venti...
Venti: Great. So that's that for the Anemo Archon's admonishments! Back to Venti Time!
Traveler: I understand.
Traveler: Sorry for borrowing the statue's Anemo power without asking...
Venti: Haha, just use it gratefully — or, better yet, treat me to a glass of dandelion wine.
Traveler: I feel cheated... but I guess I'm used to that by now.

## Talk 3

Barbara: Ah! Honorary Knight, you're awake!
Traveler: Venti... is he alright?
Barbara: Um... I wouldn't say he's "alright," exactly.
Barbara: I found you lying unconscious outside the Cathedral, and used my elemental powers to heal you...
Barbara: That bard awakened first, but strangely, my healing powers had almost no effect on him...
Barbara: This is the first time I've encountered such a patient. But he just said "it's completely normal," and then got up and left the Cathedral...
Paimon: He left? Already? Where'd he go?
Barbara: *The Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero*, that's what he said.
Barbara: I wanted to stop him, but Jean— I mean, Master Jean said to let him leave. How strange.
Traveler: (I think I understand...)
Paimon: Paimon remembers Venti healing under *that tree* before...
Paimon: (It's probably due to the connection between Windrise and the Anemo Archon. Master Jean has figured it out as well, but we can't tell Barbara...)
Traveler: (I think Jean understands...)
Traveler: What planet... are we on?
Barbara: Planet?
Paimon: #Ah! Don't listen to {F#her}{M#his} nonsense, Miss Barbara!
Barbara: Ahh... Um, okay, well basically, I found you lying outside the Cathedral, unconscious, and used my elemental powers to heal you...
Paimon: Paimon thinks you could still use a final splash of ice-cold water to the face.

## Talk 4

Venti: If you want to chat, now's the time — a bard stays not always in a single clime.
Traveler: About Dvalin...
Venti: Up till the end, Dvalin remembered his duty as one of the Four Winds.
Venti: As such, I don't intend to forcibly strip him of that duty and force my ideals of freedom onto him.
Venti: I just hope that Dvalin will be able to choose for himself and understand what freedom is.
Venti: Before I became an archon, I too was taught the meaning of freedom in this way by a friend.
Traveler: About the Abyss Order...
Venti: Kaeya shared some new intelligence, you say?
Venti: #...I see. So, the Abyss Order has a {F#Prince}{M#Princess} who orchestrated the plan to corrupt Dvalin?
Venti: #They were probably trying to turn Dvalin into a weapon of war for the Abyss. But that said, I have never heard of any such {F#Prince}{M#Princess} of the Abyss Order.
Traveler: Not an Abyss Order tradition, then.
Venti: I think so, too...
Venti: #Apparently, but how does a {F#Prince}{M#Princess} come out of nowhere and take command over the entire Abyss Order?
Traveler: So this is a recent development...
Traveler: About Signora...
Paimon: That Fatui lady didn't hang around, did she? She just grabbed your Gnosis and left!
Venti: She wanted to avoid any eyewitnesses from the Knights of Favonius.
Venti: The slightest slip-up here would have destroyed the Fatui's diplomatic relations with the Knights.
Paimon: So they're just gonna keep acting like Mondstadt's allies as if nothing happened!?
Venti: *sigh*... If only the seven nations had banded together against the Abyss Order in the first place.
Venti: The Fatui possess the strongest military among the seven nations. Yet they've used it to steal the Holy Lyre, covet the power of gods, and use Dvalin as a bargaining chip against the Knights...
Paimon: Speaking of the Lyre... didn't Diluc say something like this before?
Paimon: He said that the Fatui can only run amok across the seven nations and threaten the Knights because of the harbingers.
Venti: Yes. As I said earlier, the Cryo Archon has given them authority and strength beyond that of other mortals.
Venti: The Tsaritsa... I haven't seen her in five hundred years. What is she thinking? What's her plan?
Venti: Whatever the answer is, I have a feeling it's only going to make your search for The Seven all the more difficult...
Traveler: About deities...
Venti: As I said before, Vision wielders are known as allogenes and may ascend to Celestia.
Venti: A Gnosis is a higher-order nexus of elemental manipulation and is emblematic of an archon's status as one of The Seven.
Venti: #But as for which of The Seven took your {F#brother}{M#sister}... I'm sorry, I don't know.
Venti: ...Wait, as one of the Seven, I'm not clear of suspicion yet either, am I?
Traveler: You don't look like that god at all.
Paimon: Hang on a hot second! Tone-Deaf Bard is just one of Barbatos' many incarnations, who's to say—
Traveler: We've known you long enough to trust you.
Venti: #Haha, we're a great team indeed! Say, once you find your {F#brother}{M#sister}, how would you like to become one of the new Four Winds?
Traveler: Perhaps...
Paimon: #Hmm, you don't seem too into it, Traveler...
Paimon: Hey, Tone-Deaf Bard... If being one of the Four Winds means free food, you can consider Paimon!
Venti: Hahaha...
Traveler: There's nothing else...
Venti: Well then, best be off to *Liyue*. If the descension ritual you fail to tally, then another year you must dally.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Barbara: The Fatui were the ones who attacked you? That's too much...
Barbara: Master Jean has already returned to the Knights Headquarters. She said that she will look for evidence.
Barbara: But she also said that if no traces were left behind, the Knights might find it difficult to lodge a complaint against the culprit.
