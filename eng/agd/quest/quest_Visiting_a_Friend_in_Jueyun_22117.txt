# Visiting a Friend in Jueyun


## Talk 1

Madame Ping: Oh, please tell me I didn't leave it at the top of the mountain...
Traveler: Hey granny, fancy meeting you here.
Madame Ping: Well! Fancy running into you youngsters at a place like this! What are the chances... But, you should have put on more layers, you know. It's windy up there, you'll catch a cold.
Madame Ping: I was just on my way back to the city from Mt. Hulao. I went up there to see an old friend of mine, and we had a delightful chat about the old times.
Madame Ping: But halfway back, I've suddenly realized I've forgotten something. *sigh* I must have left it up on the mountain...
Madame Ping: At my age, I don't think I could make it all the way up there a second time in one day... It's such a long distance, and there's all that bothersome amber up there.
Madame Ping: Youngsters... Could you fetch it back from the mountain top for me? I'd be ever so grateful...
Traveler: Who is this old friend?
Madame Ping: You know, the one who lives on Mt. Hulao. You must have met him. That amber of his is a real nuisance...
Madame Ping: My memory must be going. Honestly, how could I forget to put the box in my teapot before I left...
Traveler: What did you leave up there?
Madame Ping: A box... I think. My memory is not what it once was... Why didn't I just put it in my teapot straight away? Would've saved me so much hassle.
Madame Ping: At least if it is up in the mountains, the chances are it will have become trapped in amber. So finding it once you're up there shouldn't be too difficult.
Madame Ping: Youngsters, please make a poor old lady's day. Fetch it back from Mt. Hulao for me, would you? The part where all that amber is.
Madame Ping: Mind yourselves, though. Who knows what else might be encased in amber after all these years...

## Talk 2

Madame Ping: Silly child, why ever didn't you wrap up warm before you came out? I'd feel terrible if you were to catch a cold.
Traveler: Hi granny, is this what you lost?
Madame Ping: Let me take a look... Ah yes, that's it. So I did leave it up there, after all. My memory is so hopeless these days...
Madame Ping: I'll take it now, thank you. All it contains is a few old bits and bobs anyway.
Madame Ping: These, on the other hand, are for you. Thank you dears.
Madame Ping: Now to put this box in my teapot before I forget...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Madame Ping: Silly child, why ever didn't you wrap up warm before you came out? I'd feel terrible if you were to catch a cold.
Traveler: Tell me about the amber.
Madame Ping: My old friend makes it. He says it catches monsters and bandits on their way up the mountain.
Madame Ping: It's been around a very long time indeed. Honestly, that amber has trapped some very peculiar things over the years...
Madame Ping: It really is a ghastly substance...
Traveler: How's the teapot these days...
Madame Ping: Oh, it's spick and span once again now. All thanks to you, of course!
Madame Ping: In fact, the whole reason I came all this way to collect that thing was to spruce up my teapot a little further.
Madame Ping: Once it's both spick and span and in tip-top condition, I'll finally be able to treat my guests to tea again...
