# The Littlest Journey: Means of Self-Defense?


## Talk 1

Little Meng: Eh? These two ores aren't the same either?
Master Zhang: Of course not. The quality and price of anything forged from either of these types of ores would be completely different.
Little Meng: Um, but... But this is all we have left of these two types, right?
Master Zhang: *sigh*
Traveler: What are you two doing?
Little Meng: Hi there, Traveler! I'm currently helping Dad check on the ironware that he's ordered.
Little Meng: Mister Blacksmith over here is totally the best! He said he'd forge me a small sword, too!
Little Meng: But he says that there haven't been enough raw materials to go around the store lately, so Dad's batch of ironware might be delayed...
Little Meng: And I've got no idea when my sword will be ready, either...
Master Zhang: *sigh* Well, it can't be helped. We've been very busy lately, so we're more or less out of ore.
Master Zhang: The areas where ore is most plentiful are also occupied by many monsters, so I dare not go mining there...
Master Zhang: I can only try to tide this busy period over before asking an adventurer to escort me to an area where I can mine.
Little Meng: But when will that be...
Little Meng: Actually, Traveler, I've heard that you're really good at beating monsters. Is that true?
Little Meng: If it is, could you please help me out? Please...
Traveler: Haha, alright.
Master Zhang: Traveler, are you going to check the situation out there? In that case, let me mark my usual mining spots on the map for you...
Master Zhang: Alright, that should do it. Be careful while you're there. Those places are crawling with monsters.
Little Meng: I'm counting on you then, Traveler!
Traveler: I'll... see what I can do.

## Talk 2

Master Zhang: How are things going there, Traveler?
Traveler: They should be safe for now.
Little Meng: Wow, you're amazing!
Little Meng: Dad said that he will hire a few people to protect us while we're traveling.
Little Meng: I just hope those people are as good as you are, Traveler...
Little Meng: Mister Blacksmith, does this mean that you can continue mining and making the ironware now?
Master Zhang: Hahaha, of course! Just give me a moment to prepare. I'll get those ores and be back in time to continue my work!
Master Zhang: That said, there is a limit to how much ore I can carry by myself. With any luck, that area should be free of monsters.
