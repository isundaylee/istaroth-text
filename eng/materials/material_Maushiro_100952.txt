# Maushiro

The item that Sumida sent you to find.
This Maushiro appears to have been left behind by someone before they left Tsurumi Island.
According to what Ruu tells you, the Maushiro are not musical instruments. Instead, they were used by the locals as a means of locating one another amidst the fog that shrouded their home.
