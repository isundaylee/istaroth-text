Traveler: About the Jade Chamber...
Baixiao: The Jade Chamber is where Lady Ningguang holds court. Here, she gathers information and makes important decisions.
Baixiao: From here, there is no matter in Liyue, great or small, that she cannot oversee. Nor can any rumor escape our ears or eyes.
Baixiao: Of course, we continued working for Lady Ningguang during the period before the Jade Chamber's restoration, just as we always had... But it's good to be back.
Baixiao: Unfortunately, while you are Lady Ningguang's honored guest, we cannot disclose the intelligence gathered here to you. My apologies.
