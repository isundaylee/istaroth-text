# Talk Dialog

Diluc: Although we may be able to negotiate with Stormterror, we'll most likely have to fight. Please be ready for it.
Traveler: Tell me about Angel's Share.
Diluc: Some of Dawn Winery's wine is sold at Angel's Share, a local tavern.
Diluc: I work the bar there sometimes. If you ever need to talk to me, feel free to find me there.
Diluc: Otherwise, you might need to make an appointment with my butler.
Traveler: Why are you helping us?
Diluc: I mostly decided to do it on a whim. Though I must say, that bard is quite intriguing.
Diluc: Besides, it's bad for my business if we keep letting Stormterror do whatever it pleases.
Diluc: Let me be clear though. I did it for you, not for the Knights.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Diluc: Nothing more? We'll meet at Starsnatch Cliff then.
