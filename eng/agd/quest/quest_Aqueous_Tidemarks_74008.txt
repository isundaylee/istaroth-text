# Aqueous Tidemarks


## Talk 1

Paimon: Y'know, Paimon would love to see what you look like in diving gear!
Virgil: Please take extra care in your investigation, you two.
Virgil: The nearby water bodies may contain valuable resources and clues left behind by the Forum.

## Talk 2

Virgil: Brilliant! Now we can continue further into the institute's depths. As expected of a seasoned adventurer!
Paimon: Eh? Aren't we investigating the Forum? So is it a forum, or an institute?
Virgil: Haha, sorry, I misspoke!
Virgil: And forgive me for asking this out of the blue, but did either of you ever run into anyone who was looking for me? Or did you tell anyone else about our encounter?
Paimon: Eh? Hmm... Paimon doesn't think so!
Paimon: What's wrong, Virgil? Do you owe someone a ton of Mora?
Virgil: Hahaha, no, of course not... It just occurred to me that I should let you know that there are many greedy goons who are also after the Liliacruces Forum's secret treasure.
Virgil: They're very different from us. They're willing to do anything to achieve their goals, so I've always refused to work with them. As I know the most about the treasure's whereabouts, they have me in their sights.
Virgil: I've spent a long time hiding from their prying eyes and looking for partners I can trust. It is my luck to have finally met you two, my dearest friends.
Paimon: Huh... So that's what's going on.
Virgil: In any case, I'm just relieved to hear that you never told anyone else about me. Phew! I just know I picked the right people to be my partners! Only your best friends can be relied on to keep your secrets.
Paimon: Yep! Don't worry, Virgil, we won't tell anyone else about you.
Virgil: ...Hahaha. I have complete confidence that you will never ever tell another soul about me.
Virgil: Let's go! The treasure's waiting for us.
Paimon: Yep yep! Here we come, treasure!

## Talk 3

Virgil: Please wait, you're going too fast! ... I suppose you aren't run-of-the-mill travelers after all...
Paimon: Huh, Paimon didn't think there'd be an underwater ruin like this...
Virgil: Behold, the ruins of the Liliacruces Forum!
Paimon: Well, it's become a sanctuary for all kinds of aquatic life now.
Paimon: #Oh, right. Traveler, it's time to try "that"!

## Talk 4

Virgil: To think that the key would be here...
Paimon: Hmm? Have you been here before, Virgil?
Virgil: Not long ago, my dear Paimon, my companions and I were stopped dead in front of the gate ahead, for we were not as quick-witted as the two of you.
Paimon: Well, it's good that you met us then, isn't it?
Virgil: Well said! It is my good fortune indeed!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Virgil, do we really have to continue looking for soaked pieces of paper?
Virgil: Hmm? Oh, that. Well, no, not anymore— unless you're interested in that sort of thing, anyway.
Paimon: Huh. Didn't you say that "things that are soaked rotten have their soaked rotten value" or something?
Virgil: Yes... I suppose, dear friends, you could say something like, "the situation has changed."
Paimon: Really...? Well, you're the local, so we'll take your word for it!

## Talk 6

Paimon: Whoa, hundreds of millions of Mora...

## Talk 7

Paimon: Phew, we finally got out...
Paimon: Gah, Paimon's pissed! We're gonna find that guy, and we're gonna settle the score!

## Talk 8

Virgil: Let me see... Hmph, so this is actually the "Institute of Natural Philosophy"? Looks like the wrong place after all...
Virgil: Ho, so there were things like this hidden here, how fascinating... I can use it against Sonny and the others...
Virgil: Should be able to make use of this laboratory... Take care of things first...

## Talk 9

Traveler: These things are pretty annoying...
Paimon: #Really? You think so? I seem to remember you handling it just fine back then, Traveler...

## Talk 10

Virgil: Well, knowing their extensive resources, it couldn't have been too hard for them to get their hands on these kinds of things. After all, this is the fabulously wealthy Liliacruces Forum we're talking about here!
Paimon: Hmm, but we've also explored a lot of domains and seen more than our fair share of cool things during our adventures.
Virgil: Is that so? Then I presume you've also found a lot of treasure?
Traveler: You presume correctly.
Virgil: How fascinating. I mean, what a terrific achievement. I expected nothing less from the two of you.
Paimon: It's too bad that this place is completely flooded. It really feels like a lot happened here, and they made a lot of important discoveries...
Virgil: The water levels of Fontaine have risen before. And according to the folks at the Fontaine Research Institute, they will rise again in the future. Perhaps one day, all of Fontaine will disappear beneath the waves.
Traveler: Enough to cover our travel expenses.

## Talk 11

Traveler: Wait, let me prepare first.
Virgil: Very well. But please allow me to remind you to make it quick. Treasure hates waiting.

## Talk 12

Paimon: Waaah! That'd be terrible... All that delicious food, drowned and lost forever...

## Talk 13

Paimon: Anyway, let's hope nothing like that will happen in the future!
Virgil: The future? Who cares about that? I'll be dead long before then, so why should I worry about the people alive then? What do the people and Fontaine of the future have to do with me?
Virgil: I would pay my respects to my family and friends. After all, they raised me, and have done many things for me. But have the people of the future done anything for you, for me? So what do we owe them? Isn't that right?
Traveler: ...
Virgil: ...Ahem, that's what I might have said about the issue of flooding if I lacked both patriotism and a sense of civic responsibility! Pretty abominable!
Virgil: Anyway, sorry for digressing. There should be a way to open the door below. Let's take a look around to see if there are any clues or keys.
Virgil: I'll also try to see if I can find anything in the associated files, my dear friends.
Traveler: That's pretty extreme...

## Talk 14

Traveler: Yes, please lead the way.
Virgil: Your wish is my command. Please, follow me. Our destination is not far from the Court of Fontaine...

## Talk 15

Traveler: Paimon, why don't you show him that trick of yours again...
Paimon: Beep! Construct! Beep!
Virgil: Hahaha, how fascinating! In any case, though, I think everyone would agree that humans and machines are not the same.

## Talk 16

Paimon: Though... All the places we've been have their own charm, too. It's not like Fontaine is just better than everywhere else, right?
Virgil: My friend, surely you cannot be serious? How can there be any place in Teyvat that's better than Fontaine?
Paimon: Ah, Paimon was just trying to say that other places are also really special, too! Virgil, have you ever set foot outside of Fontaine?
Virgil: My dearest Paimon, you should know that there's an old saying in Fontaine: "All waters lead to Fontaine."
Virgil: It's not the people of Fontaine who should go out and see the world, but all the world who should come and witness Fontaine's glory. Don't get it backwards.
Paimon: Do people really say that?
Virgil: Of course they do! Anyway, my friends, why don't we keep going? The treasure's still waiting for us deep inside these ruins!
Paimon: #Yeah! Let's go, Traveler!

## Talk 17

Virgil: Ugh, how can I...
Virgil: #Hm? What's wrong, Traveler? Hurry up and go find the treasure.

## Talk 18

Paimon: Ugh... Paimon sure hopes this ruin thing isn't going to suddenly stand up...
Traveler: It's just a Ruin Grader. We can handle it...
Paimon: Paimon's not worried about you being strong enough. Paimon's just scared that you'll break the treasure in the middle of the fight!
Traveler: We don't even know if there's a treasure here to break.
Paimon: There has to be! There... is, right?

## Talk 19

Paimon: Oh, we were there for the rising water level crisis, too...
Virgil: Oh, then you two know what I'm talking about. It's unfortunate, but at least it all worked out in the end.
Paimon: Yeah, just thinking about it still gives Paimon the shivers. People were adrift in the water, and if help had come any later...

## Talk 20

Paimon: This machine... Why does it look kind of... familiar...?
Traveler: I think we've seen it before...
Paimon: Well, since this order brought all kinds of mechanisms from other nations to this place, this is probably something they hauled over from some distant ruin as well.
Paimon: Wah! Paimon just had a really scary thought... Wh—What if the so-called "treasure" is just their research findings, and has nothing to do with piles of Mora at all...?
Traveler: Knowledge has value, too.
Paimon: #Yeah, you're right, Traveler... but Paimon still wants Mora!
Paimon: If we had hundreds of millions of Mora, we could build a pretty house and invite all our friends over, just eating great food and having fun day after day!
Traveler: Doesn't ring a bell...

## Talk 21

Virgil: How will we open that door and proceed onward...
Paimon: Ooh, so this is the "Forum" you were talking about! There are so many books everywhere — they must really have been dedicated to studying and conducting research...
Paimon: Paimon would never have guessed that they were a secret society plotting to overthrow the government of Fontaine!
Virgil: As the saying goes, dear Paimon, "Knowledge is power." This is especially true for the Liliacruces Forum.
Virgil: You should understand that with great knowledge comes great power. And once great power is yours to command... There will only be one path left to you.
Paimon: Uh... Paimon doesn't think that logic really holds water, but you're the local, not Paimon, so Paimon'll trust you know what you're talking about and leave it at that!
Paimon: They seem to have been researching some amazing things, though. And we've already seen plenty of stuff that obviously isn't from here on the way...

## Talk 22

Traveler: Last time we saw them was in the deserts of Sumeru.

## Talk 23

Paimon: Wow, it looks so heavy, and so hot and stuffy...
Virgil: Actually, you can place Mist Flowers wrapped in cloth inside to lower the temperature! As for the weight, well, just put it underwater.
Virgil: There's no time for delay! Let's go, my friends!

## Talk 24

Paimon: But now that you mention it, this Liliacruces Forum really did a lot of research, didn't they? We saw so many Kameras along the way...
Paimon: They were probably used to record the results of their experiments, right? And there's also a notebook here too, let's see...
Paimon: Yep, yep...
Paimon: It's hard to make out a lot of the words... It says, "When... something goes out of control, break... something else, something something, so damage can be controlled..."

## Talk 25

Paimon: There's a glass wall here, and it seems like there's a bunch of water behind it...
Traveler: Look, there are cracks in the glass.
Paimon: Ack! That looks dangerous! If the glass suddenly breaks, who knows where we'll get swept off to...
Paimon: Let's find the treasure quickly, and get the heck out of here!

## Talk 26

Traveler: Wait, let me prepare first.
Virgil: Very well. But please allow me to remind you to make it quick. Treasure hates waiting.

## Talk 27

Virgil: Well? Are you ready?

## Talk 28

Virgil: #Good heavens, Traveler, you certainly have a way with these Meka.
Paimon: Phew! We must be getting close to the treasure. After all, we've already run into the guards!
Virgil: Though Fontaine's achievements are as numerous and dazzling as the stars in the sky, the clockwork meka are undoubtedly the most exquisite of them all! Though, perhaps I shouldn't overpraise. One of the most exquisite.
Virgil: You must have traveled via aquabus when you visited the Court, correct? Tell me you've seen the intricate Steambird as well. In Fontaine, even blacksmithing is done by Meka!
Virgil: Why, the Maison Gardiennage didn't even have to lift a finger to beat me up. They just sent out some Gardemeks! It hurt so much, there was no choice but to submit...
Traveler: Beat you up?
Virgil: I mean, beat up the bad guys! Why would they ever beat me up?
Paimon: Whoa! If Meka are already so advanced, then surely the people of Fontaine don't need to do anything for themselves anymore, and can just leave everything to machines!
Virgil: Hahaha, that's a good one, my dear friend, you're just adorable! It's a lot cheaper to hire a human than buy a clockwork meka. Or to put it another way, no one and nothing can infringe on a Fontaine citizen's right to work!

## Talk 29

Traveler: Yes, please lead the way.
Virgil: Your wish is my command. Please, follow me. Our destination is not far from the Court of Fontaine...
