Amber: Hahaha, it's been ages since I've built a snowman — it's so fun! Still a little cold, though... Brrr... My fingers are numb...
Eula: Amber, if the cold is getting to you, there's always hot soup back at the camp. Take a rest if you need one. Don't put too much pressure on yourself.
Joel: So Amber really feels the cold, huh... but Aunty Eula, it doesn't seem to affect you at all.
Eula: Maybe it's because of our different capabilities. Elemental energy is... Ahem, sorry, not something you need to know about in any great detail. Simply put, it's because we have different abilities.
Amber: Yeah, harnessing the cold is definitely her specialty. In fact — in summertime, just standing next to her cools me down!
Joel: Huh... c—capability? I didn't really get it, but... never mind. I like snowmen too.
Joel: I, uh... really wish my dad could see them...

Amber: Wanna team up with me? Huh, I should warn you though, I don't slow down for anyone, greenhorn or otherwise.
Traveler: Jean seems to be pretty reliable.
Amber: With Jean by our side, nothing can stand in our way! ...At least, that's what I wanna say...
Amber: But I can't keep spouting that same old line.
Amber: She always dashes headlong into the heat of the battle, and we want her to take better care of herself.
Amber: I really hope that one day I can look Jean in the eye and tell her she doesn't need to worry anymore, because we have her back...
Traveler: You seem pretty good with a wind glider.
Amber: As a novice within the Knights of Favonius, your understanding of the wind is absolutely crucial.
Amber: Leave the advanced wind glider training to me!
Traveler: Goodbye.
Amber: Let's all do our best to defeat Stormterror!
