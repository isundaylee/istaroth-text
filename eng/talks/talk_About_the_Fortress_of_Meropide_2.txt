Traveler: About the Fortress of Meropide...
Nizami: It's annoying that fights are banned outside of the arena. And there are hardly any monsters nearby... I need a place to cut loose and put my fists and feet to good use.
Nizami: As for the strongest fighter in the Fortress of Meropide, I've got a candidate in mind. But he seems very busy and I rarely see him.
Nizami: And I'm not yet qualified to spar with him. I wonder if I'll get a chance before I leave Fontaine?
