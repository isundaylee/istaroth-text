Traveler: What do you do here?
Zhigui: Thanks for asking! To put it simply, I'm responsible for liaison work between the Communications Office's Hezhe Post and the Millelith, the teahouses, the Secure Transport Agency, and other organizations.
Zhigui: If the leader of a group of guards for hire has guards waiting to be dispatched, I'll go get an order from Hezhe Post.
Zhigui: If the teahouse sends someone here to confirm a tea delivery order on its behalf, I'll direct them to talk to the appropriate harbor staff to discuss the details.
Zhigui: If a merchant wants make a large shipment to a foreign port and needs to have his goods inspected and registered first, I'll connect them to a specialist at Hezhe Post...
