# Missing title (3642423687)


## Talk 1

Jinwu: Ah, you're here. Thanks for helping us clear the path. Zhiqiong was also a big help in guiding us, as well, so thank you both.
Traveler: Tell me about the camp.
Jinwu: Well, it looks good, eh? My specialty, by the way.
Jinwu: I started learning all this from my father starting from the time I was around ten... How to set up campsites, how to make crystal lamps, how to maintain mining equipment...
Jinwu: I learned and learned, and my father grew old all the while... Eventually, when his eyesight started failing, it fell to me to maintain the safety equipment in the mine.
Jinwu: And even later on... Well, as you can see, I'm not young anymore myself. As for the rest of my tale, it's not much... I found a man, lost a man, had a daughter who went off to Sumeru to study...
Jinwu: Sometimes, when the men at the mines leave us early, it falls to me to take care of their kids... So I carry some sweets around all the time.
Jinwu: And that's why... in my mind, kids always look this way to me: sweet-smelling, staring at me from where they are on the ground, waiting for candy or some colorful rocks to play with.
Paimon: Whoa. Uh, so, do you have candy on you right now, Jinwu?
Jinwu: Candy? Well, it's not the fancy type like you'd get in the city, but you're not going to be picky now, are you?
Paimon: Ah, so that's the kind of candy you're talking about...
Jinwu: People come and go, leaving only memories behind to accompany me... and adventurers who go into the mines like you, of course.
Traveler: Tell me a bit about Zhiqiong.
Jinwu: Zhiqiong's from our latest batch of miners, and she was born in Mingyun Village. To be honest, all the experienced miners at The Chasm were from Mingyun Village. Zhiqiong was just born at the wrong time.
Jinwu: Ah, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that times are hard. I'm just saying that the ore veins dried up at Mingyun a good long time ago, so work there has already ceased.
Jinwu: Shortly after Zhiqiong came to The Chasm, the incident happened and work here stopped as well. I guess she and mining just aren't meant to be.
Traveler: Uh...
Jinwu: Everyone went their separate ways after that. I stayed, though — it's not as if the equipment will maintain themselves. She, on the other hand, became an adventurer.
Jinwu: She hasn't grown up at all, though, and still doesn't value her life at all... or maybe she's just spent too little time down in the mines.
Jinwu: I'm pretty sure that getting used to the mining life and saving a few people from perilous situations might give her a new appreciation for life.
Jinwu: Well, I'm not sure if I can make this request of you, but could you watch over her for me? I'd hate to see her get herself killed.
Traveler: See you.
Jinwu: Alright then. Take care!

## Talk 2

Clitopho: Hello! How have your travels been going?
Traveler: Fine, and you?
Clitopho: Thanks for giving me that opportunity back there. After our attempt to create the cannonball fuse earlier succeeded, everyone's warmed up to the idea of letting me stay.
Clitopho: As for what I'll do after getting back to the surface... Heh, I haven't thought it all through yet, but I probably won't rejoin the Treasure Hoarders!
Traveler: Probably...?
Clitopho: Uh, oh, I mean, I'm definitely never rejoining the Treasure Hoarders! Definitely!
Traveler: See you.
Clitopho: Take care of yourself!
Traveler: Really...?

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Khedive: That... *sigh* Eh? Oh. Hello. Sorry. You bothered me there.
Traveler: So, does that make us even?
Khedive: Alright, no need to horse around. Our current situation is not good. Not good at all, really.
Khedive: You've seen that shining crystal fragment already, right? If my guess is not off, there should be an even larger one deeper down... Although I suppose you already knew that.
Khedive: In theory, our readings should have stabilized once the fragment above "returned" to its original location. And that's what happened, in fact... But the waveform is wrong... all wrong.
Traveler: What are you talking about?
Khedive: Not much of a student, were you? Well then, let me put this simply. We are currently akin to beans on a stone mill, on the brink of a clash between two great powers.
Khedive: Albeit on a larger time scale, we are presently being crushed by these two forces — one from above and one from below — and we shall soon be turned into bean paste!
Khedive: Just wait and see if you don't believe me yet. That adventurer named Zhiqiong... Well, I've seen what happens to those who get too close to such things.
Khedive: Today it's going to be coughing up blood, and tomorrow, she might just cough her innards out too.
Traveler: Is there anything I can do to help?
Khedive: You? Well, give me some time to think... There's got to some way we can...
Khedive: Well, whatever the case, what we need most urgently now is for you to continue exploring until you find out what happened down there.
Khedive: Don't worry, I won't sit by and do nothing in this situation. I've got to make sure that my investments see return, after all, so I must see to the safety of the exploration team.
Traveler: Will you be taking responsibility for me, too?
Khedive: Mmm, well... I have to admit that your abilities have completely exceeded my estimations. As such, I think that you're more than capable of taking responsibility for yourself.
Khedive: Agh, never mind, what am I saying... If something does happen to you, I'll compensate you, okay?
Traveler: Use words that I understand, please.

### Additional Talk 2

Taliesin: Sorry, I'm a little dizzy at the moment, but I can take it! Ugh...
Traveler: What is it you're doing here?
Taliesin: I consider myself a bard of the old school, so of course I'm here to get some inspiration.
Paimon: Well! You looked pretty alright just a moment ago, and now you look like you're about to drop any second!
Taliesin: I've never gone down into a mine before... And in my hurry during in getting here, I wound up... pulling a muscle.
Taliesin: Ow ow ow...
Traveler: I won't disturb you, then.
Taliesin: Agh... This medicinal oil really isn't doing it for me... Well, see you, and do come to me again when you have new stories to tell, alright?

### Additional Talk 3

Jinwu: Oh, you're here.
Jinwu: Something's been wrong with Zhiqiong lately. I suspect that it's that... tainted stuff that's affecting her mind and body.
Jinwu: Whatever it is, it's strikingly similar to the way in which locals here five hundred years ago described the dark calamity...
Jinwu: But today, the Yakshas are a distant memory, and Rex Lapis too has left us... I must admit that this is the most worried I've ever been for the safety of us mortals.
Jinwu: Sorry... I kept you back just to tell you all this pointless nonsense. Still...
Jinwu: Never mind... You stay safe now, alright?

### Additional Talk 4

Clitopho: Zhiqiong left just a moment ago. She seemed pretty angry about something... Do you know what happened?
Clitopho: I mean, come on! She said that she wouldn't be mad at me anymore... and yet her temper hasn't changed for the better in the slightest since coming to this campsite.
Clitopho: That Khedive guy's telling everyone that Zhiqiong's lost it and has to leave The Chasm...
Clitopho: Heh. Sounds like he's the one who needs to get his head checked.

### Additional Talk 5

Taliesin: Phew, the swelling in my leg's gone down... as has the pain. I should probably write an epic for Liyue's medicinal oils, hmm...
Taliesin: Ah, sorry, didn't see you there — I've just been resting over here all this while.
Taliesin: If you're looking for Zhiqiong, I believe she said that she was looking for some kind of gate...
Taliesin: She said that she'd share the story of her adventure with me, too. Just head over that way, you should find her easily.

### Additional Talk 6

Khedive: Sorry for telling you all that.
Khedive: I won't take up any more of your time... We've all got things to busy ourselves with, after all.

### Additional Talk 7

Jinwu: Back again, are we? Do you need something?
Traveler: About Zhiqiong...
Jinwu: She went back up to fix some map errata. I'm not sure what the hurry's about... But it's good to see that she's in good spirits.
Jinwu: Whatever you, whatever the case... I don't know what methods you used to bring her back, but I'm just glad she is. We all are, really.

### Additional Talk 8

Clitopho: Hello there! If you're up for a chat, I'm all ears!
Traveler: Well, you sure look like a pair of idle hands.
Clitopho: Oh, come on. Are you taking me for a slacker? I'll have you know that every time I'm needed, I barely have time for anything else!
Traveler: How's Zhiqiong?
Clitopho: Her? She seems to have calmed down a lot after coming back. Honestly, I wonder if it isn't just this eerie environment that's making everyone's fuses shorter and tempers hotter.
Clitopho: I was just scolded by Jinwu not long ago. Never seen her that angry in my life... Still gives me chills to think about it.
Traveler: See you.
Clitopho: See you, and take care!

### Additional Talk 9

Khedive: Thanks for your help. Without your aid so far, I'm quite sure our expedition would have proved a failure.
Khedive: I don't know what you did, but the readings of the Ley Line flows in this area have stabilized significantly... Heh, and the expansion of the contaminants is currently slowing.
Khedive: As for why that is... Perhaps the answer may be found even deeper in the earth, but really, who knows?
Khedive: And as for Zhiqiong... Well, all I'll say is that she can still leave now. She values The Chasm over her life... not realizing that The Chasm seems set on taking it from her.

### Additional Talk 10

Zhiqiong: I'm very sorry... I know my stubbornness caused you a lot of trouble.
Zhiqiong: I'll continue to refine the maps I've made and help Jinwu place beacons to observe the behavior of that dark substance.
Zhiqiong: They... They say that this substance might be related to the dark calamity that occurred five hundred years ago. It's just unclear if it's an aftershock, or if it's just a sign of things still to come...
Zhiqiong: Whatever the case, thanks for showing me the limitations of a normal human being, and... for showing me how to pursue my dreams within those limits.
Paimon: Huh. Look who's sounding like a philosopher now, eh?
Traveler: I never thought quite that deeply, I think.
Zhiqiong: It's just that... you've helped me so much, and by comparison, I need your help just to do simple things like drawing maps...
Zhiqiong: And I always drag you down when we get into dangerous situations...
Traveler: I'm just concerned for your safety.
Zhiqiong: Yes... And I won't give up, either. I'll set out again once I've rested enough.
Traveler: It's fine. I hope that you can finish your maps.

### Additional Talk 11

Jinwu: Haha, you're back. Well then, sit down and rest for a bit. Make yourself at home!
Traveler: I wouldn't call this place "homely," per se.
Jinwu: Hahahaha! Ow, your tongue's sharp!
Jinwu: Thanks to your help, the atmosphere at the camp has become way more relaxed. If I gave you the impression that I was the overly-serious sort before, I'm very sorry about that.
Jinwu: The important business has already been settled. Now, the long-term work that remains is... setting up a permanent lookout underground to watch for any changes in the situation.
Jinwu: During this period, many mines can now be partially opened, but going this far underground is still forbidden.
Jinwu: We need to seal up this area and prevent any miners... No, prevent anyone from coming down here.
Traveler: What am I now, a tunnel-dweller?

### Additional Talk 12

Clitopho: Ah, you're here! Welcome to the Chasm Exploration Team's demolitions team base and water point!
Clitopho: We — by which I mean I, Clitopho — salute you!
Clitopho: Come, come, have a drink! Consider it my treat — just a little something for all you've done for me.
Traveler: What's next for you?
Clitopho: Well, I'm an official member of the team now, so since they're staying, I'm staying.
Clitopho: Well, things would certainly be easier if Khedive and Jinwu could get me some extra help...
Clitopho: Though that said, I wouldn't be able to call myself the sole member *and* team leader if that were to happen.
Traveler: Will you be sticking around?

### Additional Talk 13

Khedive: #Oh? Why, hello there! I thought you'd left, Traveler.
Khedive: The energy readings around here have stabilized a great deal, thanks to you. When I go back and write my thesis, I will mention you for sure.
Khedive: However, as the nominal employer of the exploration team, I will still need to stay for a long time to observe this place.
Traveler: Well, I've got to go.
Khedive: Then I shan't keep you. Just know that you'll always be welcome with the exploration team!
