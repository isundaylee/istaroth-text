Traveler: Is there anything of note nearby?

Tepano: Hmm... I can't think of anything worth mentioning, but the scenery is pretty nice.

Tepano: Ah, it's so relaxing, what with no one messing about here.

Traveler: In a good mood, I see?
Tepano: You bet.
Tepano: Patrolling around the Masters of the Night-Wind is just the easiest thing. These people are either impossible to find or holed up indoors.
Tepano: And the few not-very-intimidating monsters that there are in the area can be easily beaten using pre-prepared Phlogiston Engravings.
Tepano: The main thing I've gotta do is keep reckless outsiders from disturbing the Iktomisaurs. Get on their bad side and their tempers are no joke, I'll tell you that.

Traveler: Calming people down requires skill.
Tepano: Very true!
Tepano: Some Saurians are just too stubborn. The last time someone touched an Iktomisaurus's feathers without permission, they ended up writing a three-page apology!
Tepano: Who knows if the apology even made sense to the Saurian? But I guess that just goes to show the price of acting on impulse, haha.
