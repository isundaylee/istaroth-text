Traveler: About the Exchange...
Hatim: Oh, the Kalimi Exchange. It's a place where you can see people's strengths, courage, and insights in action.
Hatim: If you have the assets and the wealth, as well as sound judgment, you can really turn a profit here.
Hatim: Sufficient wealth isn't a problem for a bona fide noble like myself. The Homayanis haven't got anything on my family!
Hatim: No, all I'm missing right now is an opportunity... to make my family fortune even more abundant. That way, my children can rest easy knowing that they won't have to go be merchants!
