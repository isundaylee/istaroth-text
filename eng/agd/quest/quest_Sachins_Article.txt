# Sachin's Article


## Talk 1

Dori: #Well, well, if it isn't Traveler and Paimon, yet again!
Dori: I have the latest update on the Akademiya Extravaganza. Would you like to hear it?
Paimon: How much is it?
Dori: It's free! Isn't Lord Sangemah Bay generous?
Dori: Do you guys remember Sachin?
Paimon: The guy who sponsored the Akademiya Extravaganza! Paimon heard that the prize money and Diadem of Knowledge came from him.
Dori: Bingo! In fact, not long ago, when I was doing business in the desert, I met an old businessman.
Dori: And guess what I got from him? A dealer's ledger! With it, I can avoid dangerous areas in the desert and go to more places!
Dori: Of course, the most important thing is that the ledger mentions Sachin!
Dori: It turned out that Sachin had been to the desert to investigate the people's local conditions and customs. He also had cordial exchanges with the traveling merchants in the desert!
Dori: Much of the text is lost, but this is a first-hand account of the big sponsor behind the Akademiya Extravaganza! Would you like a look?
Paimon: Okay. Let's have a look, then.
Paimon: Eh... this is all hard to understand! Dori, what does this all mean?
Dori: What does this all mean? I'm afraid that if you need it analyzed, it'll cost you an extra million Mora!
Paimon: Forget it, then!
Dori: Well, since you're not paying, that'll be all for Dori's special news.
Dori: But let me give you a hint! There should be someone here who's been to a lot of Akademiya Extravaganzas. Perhaps you could talk to them?

## Talk 2

Vasudeva: Alas, seeing these young children, I can't help but reminisce about the past.
Vasudeva: The Interdarshan Championship has always been a stage for young talent. Unfortunately, not every genius will be successful eventually...
Traveler: Why do you say that?
Vasudeva: Geniuses are mostly stubborn and cold, and find it hard to understand the pain of others.
Vasudeva: Empathetic people, on the other hand, often fall into self-doubt and depression.
Vasudeva: People who are not firm can only stand still, while people who are determined but walk down the wrong path refuse to look back. There's a lot to think about here...

## Talk 3

Huvishka: For this year's Interdarshan Championship, my favorite has to be Cyno.
Huvishka: Aside from his skills as the General Mahamatra, looking back at the tournament's history, the Spantamad Darshan has the highest percentage of champions.
Huvishka: Many people say that the Spantamad Darshan produces many talented people, such as Cyrus, Ruzicka, Lisa, Cyno...
Huvishka: The brighter the talent, the sooner the game will lose its suspense. The most exciting competition was still twenty years ago.
Huvishka: At that time, my friend also participated in the game, and I went there to cheer for him. The last round was played in Avidya Forest. In the end, no one dared to approach them, and no one knew what was going on in the depths of the forest...
Huvishka: Then I heard the Akademiya shut down the competition. Later, the Interdarshan Championship removed many of the events in which people fought to the death, discouraging people from being desperate enough to do so.
Traveler: What is your friend like?
Huvishka: Let me think. He's honest and kind, but he's also vulnerable and sensitive.
Huvishka: Most of all, he cares about us. When we drink together, our time is filled with laughter and cheer.
Huvishka: It's just too bad that it's all in the past now. Among the friends we drank with, some died, some disappeared, some now live in seclusion... They say fate is fickle. Perhaps it's true.
Paimon: Looks like something did happen twenty years ago... Right, didn't Wiqas tell us to seek him out if we had any questions?
Paimon: Now that we have time, why don't we ask him?

## Talk 4

Wiqas: ...That incident from twenty years ago? Why the sudden question? Did you hear any particular information?
Paimon: We've heard that the diadem seems to have been lost twenty years ago, and some contestant's personality has changed...
Wiqas: You seem to know a lot about that.
Paimon: Wiqas, is there something you're not telling us?
Wiqas: Not exactly. I was five years old when it happened. How could I know?
Wiqas: But there are things I've never told anyone. I'm actually a part of the Akademiya Extravaganza's planning committee, because of the influence of a senior colleague.
Wiqas: That senior colleague and I met on a trip. He was... a bit timid, and would always flee and cower somewhere at the first sign of an emergency.
Wiqas: One day, four years ago, I said to him: "I want to go back to the Akademiya. The Akademiya Extravaganza is about to begin."
Paimon: And then?
Wiqas: Upon mentioning the Akademiya Extravaganza, he got startled and said something about "it has nothing to do with me."
Wiqas: When I said goodbye to him, he insisted on getting a drink with me. After several drinks, he started talking all sorts of nonsense.
Wiqas: I also had too many, and in my drunken stupor, I didn't really hear him that well.
Wiqas: I only remember that he said that he lost the Diadem of Knowledge for a while. He was in charge of the distribution and recovery of the Diadem of Knowledge, and that he nearly had a heart attack upon realizing that the diadem was missing. Fortunately, he finally found it in a tree hole.
Paimon: Like the one we saw before...
Wiqas: He said that the Diadem of Knowledge is a very valuable treasure, which is recorded in many ancient books. Legend has it that it was built by a famous craftsman in ancient times, and carries a secret that no one knows.
Wiqas: Sachin had entrusted the Akademiya to safeguard the diadem, after all. If my senior was responsible for the diadem's disappearance, he could not afford to pay for it with his meager wealth.
Wiqas: Even if the loss was temporary, no one should know of it, lest the Akademiya find him guilty of gross negligence.
Paimon: So he covered it up?
Wiqas: Yes. It seems that he also said that many people came to inquire about it, including children. But he said that the diadem had never been lost.
Wiqas: But he was so scared that when things blew over, he quit his job and left the Akademiya.
Wiqas: I drank too much that night, and when I woke up the next day, he was gone. The more I thought about it, the more I had a bad feeling that issues would crop up in the Akademiya Extravaganza if entrusted to someone like him.
Wiqas: I didn't have a job at the time, so I joined the Akademiya Extravaganza Planning Committee. I tried to investigate things on the inside too, but I couldn't find anything.
Wiqas: And the diadem was found, and the man whose personality was said to have changed, was dead, and there was nothing to be found.
Wiqas: Still, twenty years is still a long time. Long enough that the people involved from the beginning no longer remember nor care.
Wiqas: That's all I know. If you're curious, keep investigating and maybe one day, you'll discover the truth...
Paimon: That's easy for you to say. We don't have much to go on. Do you have any more information? Like where the senior colleague went?
Wiqas: I haven't heard from him. Later, I also went to the desert to look for him, but in the vast desert, it was almost impossible to run into him.
Wiqas: To make up for it, I do have some information on Sachin. Would you like to hear it?
Paimon: Emm... sure! Tell us!
Wiqas: When I was traveling, I did so with an Eremite commander. While we were chatting, he said he came into possession of an article written by an Akademiya researcher.
Wiqas: He seemed to think it was something precious, and refused to show it to anyone, only to let me peek at it at my request. I only caught a glimpse of it, but I saw that it was signed by Sachin.
Wiqas: I didn't know who Sachin was, nor did I care. After joining the Akademiya Extravaganza Planning Committee, I found out that he was an important member of the Vahumana Darshan who sponsored the event.
Wiqas: If you're interested, you can find the Eremite commander in the desert. He's usually in the Valley of Dahri.
Paimon: Information related to Sachin? Alright, let's go take a look.

## Talk 5

Suhayb: What do you want?
Paimon: Whoa! This guy looks real fierce!
Suhayb: Either say your piece, or leave. I have no time for you.
Paimon: Actually, we heard that you have Sachin's article on you, so we were wondering if we could have a look.
Suhayb: ...Are you kidding me?
Paimon: No! Why would you ask that?
Suhayb: It seems like you guys really don't know. Some time ago, I had the article appraised. Turns out, it's nothing more than a personal travel journal, and is of little value.
Suhayb: He hired my father to keep him safe. That Sachin fellow would often walk, ask, write, and mumble.
Suhayb: There was one time his papers were blown away by the wind. He said it was no big deal. My father, however, thought that things written by intellectuals must be valuable, so he looked around for them at night with a torch.
Suhayb: None among my family can read. My father cherished this article and then passed it onto me. I had no idea it was completely worthless.
Paimon: Sounds unfortunate... but do you still have it?
Suhayb: Yes. You want to have a look? You can look at it as much as you want. Since it's not worth anything, there's no need for me to be so stingy.
Paimon: So this is the article that Sachin wrote? Eh... to be honest, Paimon can't make sense of any of it.
Paimon: But... judging from the crummy handwriting, Paimon can't say exactly why, but Paimon has the feeling he was going through a tough time?
Paimon: Well, we're done reading it. Thank you very much!
Suhayb: You're welcome. It's not worth any money, but I'm going to keep it anyway. After all, my father entrusted it to me. Come see me again if you want to look at it again.
