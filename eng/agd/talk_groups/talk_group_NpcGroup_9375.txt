Navia: Since we're having a break, how about we enjoy some sweet treats?
Navia: If you want my recommendation, I'd say lemon cheesecake is the perfect choice for this occasion! Unlike Macarons, it has a tartness to it as well as the sweetness, which excites the tastebuds and keeps you awake and alert.
Navia: That way, we won't fall asleep reading!

Navia: We'll have to break out the big guns if we wanna show those domain-dwellers who's boss.
Navia: ...Heh, that didn't sound so different from something I might say in a Spina meeting.
Navia: I guess it's the same job, at the end of the day: Getting thugs and bullies to eat some humble pie. It's the only way they'll ever learn some manners.

Navia: I'm assuming that the books here aren't for lending out...?
Navia: In that case, I guess I'll have to read as much as I can while I'm here and take detailed notes on the best stories. I'm sure the children of Poisson would love to hear them.
Navia: Also... I noticed that some of the "fairy tales" here really aren't suitable for children at all... Makes me curious what sort of quirky person could've written them, haha.
