Traveler: Would you like to switch jobs?
Gravier: Thanks for the suggestion. You're a good person, just like Monsieur Neuvillette.
Gravier: I'm new here, and this is my first job, while my superior seems to have high expectations for me.
Gravier: He hopes that I will bring some youthful vigor to the rather lifeless Palais Mermonia, and I don't see myself working up the courage to refuse.
Gravier: *sigh* If only I had known, I would have switched jobs with Iaune, who only recently joined as well... He seems like a much cheerier sort than I.
