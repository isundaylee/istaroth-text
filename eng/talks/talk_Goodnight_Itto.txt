Traveler: Goodnight, Itto.
Arataki Itto: Wait... what? You're hitting the hay already?
Arataki Itto: Come on, sleep is for the weak! Not champions like you and I! You wanna play some Hide-and-Seek?
Arataki Itto: Playing at night takes it to a whole other level. Seriously, I'm preparing to go full oni on you here â€” so make sure you find a good hiding spot, capiche!?
