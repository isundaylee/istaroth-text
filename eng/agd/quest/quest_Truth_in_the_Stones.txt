# Truth in the Stones


## Talk 1

Paimon: So strange... how could the four of them just suddenly disappear...? Did they run away from something?
Paimon: Let's look around first and see if we can find any clues!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Over here! What's this?
Paimon: A pile of shirts, some trousers...
Zhongli: A few everyday items, they must belong to Uncle Dai and his men.
Paimon: One, two, three, four...
Paimon: Huh... that seems right. Ten shirts, ten pairs of trousers.
Paimon: These must be spares, right? Look, Uncle Dai's clothes are identical.
Zhongli: The four of them have been gone for six days without a change of clothes.
Paimon: There's also a few handkerchiefs and some soap lying around... Oh, and some tool belts.
Zhongli: Items for washing one's face before the dawn shift... mining equipment...
Paimon: So... they didn't take any supplies...
Zhongli: Hmm, correct.
Traveler: Maybe they didn't need them?
Zhongli: Improbable.
Zhongli: There are four pickaxes missing. It seems likely they left with the tools of their trade.
Zhongli: They had time to take their tools, but not their everyday items? Curious.
Paimon: Huh... why would someone set off with their tools, but leave their luggage behind?
Zhongli: One: They were working close by and didn't need to move their personal effects. But seeing as they've yet to return, this seems an unlikely hypothesis.
Zhongli: Or, two: They were forced to leave and had no time to think about their supplies.
Paimon: Oh...!
Traveler: Do you think... someone kidnapped them?
Zhongli: It's certainly a possibility. We'll need more clues before any further inference can be made.
Paimon: If they didn't leave, maybe they were made to leave... Let's make a note and let Uncle Dai know.
Traveler: Maybe they just forgot them?

## Talk 3

Paimon: Kun Jun, what do you have there?
Kun Jun: Oh, right on time.
Zhongli: Did you find anything?
Kun Jun: There's a chunk of ore here, perhaps there are clues within.
Paimon: Ore? What does it have to do with the disappearance?
Kun Jun: Let's find out. I'll give it a try. A moment please.
Kun Jun: ... Okay...
Zhongli: ...
Paimon: Uh... Looks like he's concentrating really hard. What's he up to?
Kun Jun: I see... four men... following someone out of the mine... it looks like a child.
Paimon: A child? What's a child doing in a mine!?
Kun Jun: I'm not sure...
Paimon: Also, how did you "see" anything exactly?
Kun Jun: Oh! I don't mean "see" in the traditional sense... I—I would appreciate it if what I'm about to tell you remained a secret. It's a little odd... I've never dared to tell anyone before.
Kun Jun: I can... perceive the memories of ore.
Paimon: Huh—!?
Zhongli: "Perceive?" So there's no... conjecture at work?
Paimon: You mean you can put your hand on a rock and — boom! It just happens?
Kun Jun: I've always sensed that ore contains "memories." Sometimes it records events that occur in the surrounding area. All I have to do is touch one and focus my attention, and the memories come to me.
Paimon: Amazing! So you can find out everything that ever happened there!
Kun Jun: It depends on the ore. Some ores have astounding memories. Others, like Iron Ore and White Iron Ore aren't up to much. Their memories are hazy.
Kun Jun: Cor Lapis and crystal memories are much stronger. They record more events and in greater detail.
Zhongli: Stone-seeing... fascinating. A rare ability indeed. It was prudent of Uncle Dai to recruit you, Mr. Kun Jun.
Kun Jun: Haha, I'm glad I can be of assistance.
Kun Jun: Based on what I saw, I believe they followed this path.
Zhongli: This will take us north, away from the mine.
Paimon: North... another clue for Uncle Dai! Let's make a note of it.

## Talk 4

Paimon: We've found some clues. Time to report back to Uncle Dai.

## Talk 5

Uncle Dai: You're back! How are the investigations going?
Zhongli: We found three clues in the vicinity.
Zhongli: First, there are four missing pickaxes, yet everyday items are still in their place. This suggests that your men didn't leave of their own accord, but were forced to.
Uncle Dai: Forced to!? But... who would kidnap miners?
Zhongli: Who, indeed. Second, there were five workers at the mine. One of them left the site to take respite. When he awoke, his colleagues had disappeared without a trace.
Zhongli: Those who kept working all disappeared. The one who left early emerged safe and sound. It would appear that the incident occurred on-site.
Uncle Dai: Now that you mention it, I recall Bravo saying that he took a break.
Uncle Dai: Could someone have entered the site and simply walked away with them!?
Zhongli: This leads me to my third point. Mr. Kun Jun here made good use of his... expert techniques... to arrive at a conclusion. It was a child that took your men away.
Uncle Dai: A child!? But there are no settlements here for miles around! There's no way a child would have made it over to the mine!
Paimon: Unlikely as it sounds, that's our conclusion. Your men were following a child.
Uncle Dai: Where did they go?
Zhongli: We believe that they followed the road north, away from the mine and toward the ruins.
Uncle Dai: North! Right, I'll rally my men and head in pursuit.
Traveler: Do you need help?
Uncle Dai: You've been invaluable to the investigation, but leave the legwork to us. If we set off now and make haste, we might be able to catch them.
Zhongli: Not so fast. The incident occurred six days ago. Even if they set out on foot, they will have covered a lot of ground by now.
Uncle Dai: *sigh* You're right... New plan. I'll lead my search party over to the settlements further out and make some inquiries.
Uncle Dai: There are only a few settlements around here with lodging for the night. We'll go investigate and see if we can come up with anything.
Uncle Dai: In the meantime you could keep looking for clues. If we don't see each other, let's reconvene at Wangshu Inn tomorrow evening.
Zhongli: Agreed.
Uncle Dai: Alright, me and my men will get going!
Paimon: So... they're gonna talk to the people over at the settlements, while we keep investigating here...
Zhongli: Correct.
Paimon: But... there aren't any more clues at the mine... Shouldn't we go north?
Zhongli: Wait... I believe we're missing someone.
Paimon: Huh?
Paimon: Oh yeah, where's Kun Jun? Paimon bets he's still investigating. Let's go find him!

## Talk 6

Paimon: Kun Jun! What are you searching for? We're all out of clues! Let's get going!
Kun Jun: Ah, apologies, I'm conducting a quick search for my own benefit. I'm looking for a precious stone known as Dragonfall.
Zhongli: Dragonfall?
Traveler: Never heard of it.
Zhongli: Dragonfall is often used in forging. What use do you have for it?
Kun Jun: I... I don't know.
Kun Jun: I—I'm sorry, I don't recall why I'm seeking it... I've been feeling very... absent lately. Name and address aside, I'm having trouble remembering things.
Kun Jun: In fact, I've been feeling extremely... anxious... as if there's something I've forgotten to finish. It's... an unpleasant sensation.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon knows that feeling! When you know you've forgotten something but you can't remember exactly what it is.
Kun Jun: Ugh... I don't even know where to start with it, I've been... aimlessly wandering. That day at the market, I overheard a conversation while I was buying something. They mentioned Dragonfall.
Kun Jun: It sounded so familiar to me, as if whatever it was I had to do was linked to that stone... So I decided to look for some.
Kun Jun: Perhaps if I can retrieve some, I'll remember what it is I have to do.
Zhongli: I see... If I am able to during our endeavour, I will help you look for this stone.
Kun Jun: Really? Oh, thank you Mr. Zhongli! You're too kind!
Zhongli: Think nothing of it.
Paimon: Shouldn't we get going?
Zhongli: Heading north from The Chasm, we'll reach Lingju Pass. If this is indeed the path they chose, there will be traces.
Paimon: Great! Let's have a look!
Traveler: Not my area of expertise.
