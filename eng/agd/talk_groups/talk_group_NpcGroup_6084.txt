Traveler: Do I shine or something?
Imix: Yep, exactly! Everyone has their own special radiance.

Imix: As for me... Hehe, I won't tell you just yet!

Traveler: Can you really see those colors?
Imix: Tsk tsk... You can't just ask such an unromantic question! We're all human beings with similar sensations and feelings. What tastes salty to me will probably also taste salty to you, and the same goes for things that are too cold or too steamy!
Imix: Mhm, so everyone will have a gem that's uniquely suited to them. Even if it just looks like a glass marble to someone else, it might be the most special thing in the entire world to you.
Imix: Master Cheven's got the laaaaaargest gemstone vault that I've ever seen! So what do you think? Wanna come take a look with me?
