# Katheryne in Inazuma

Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque! Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild.
Katheryne: You've come at last. I've been waiting for you, Adventurer.
Traveler: An—Another Katheryne...
Katheryne: Another? Hehe, have you ever seen multiple Katherynes in a single location?
Katheryne: If you haven't, then they were one and the same.
Katheryne: As the only year-round receptionist in the Adventurers' Guild, I can use a special tool to instantly move between various locations in the world to deal with various important matters...
Katheryne: After I help you with your matters here, I need to head over to Fontaine. The adventurers over there are notorious for frugality, so I need to receive them well.
Traveler: Re—Really?
Katheryne: Hmm... You believed me? Sorry, I was joking. Please don't take it seriously.
Katheryne: Also, I thought you knew how to use Teleport Waypoints?
Katheryne: Anyway, I won't bother you with pointless trivia. Come, I'll help you process the work that's needed by the Inazuma Adventurers' Guild.
Katheryne: Once things are processed, you can accept commissions here and also enjoy other benefits.
Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque, Adventurer.
Traveler: I also want to teleport!
