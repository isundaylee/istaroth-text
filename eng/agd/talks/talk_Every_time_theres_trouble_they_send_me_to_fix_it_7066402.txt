Honglang: Every time there's trouble, they send me to fix it...
Traveler: About this Domain...
Honglang: There are a bunch of randomly distributed wind currents in this Domain. Some of them even collide with each other, forming a zone impassable via flight.
Honglang: It's also pretty much impossible to force your way through these wind currents using a wind glider.
Honglang: However, we have also discovered some mechanisms in this Domain. Activating them seems to affect some wind currents...
Honglang: We think that if we can make smart use of these mechanisms, it should make exploring this Domain a heck of a lot easier...
Honglang: However, there's also a bunch of monsters from who-knows-where skulking around in this Domain...
Honglang: So please, take extra care while exploring this Domain, Traveler.
Traveler: About yourself...
Honglang: Me? I'm just a regular old adventurer, until Lan put me in charge of exploring unknown Domains of this type... *sigh*
Honglang: She said something about trusting my abilities and believing that I would do great things.
Honglang: But I think she just wanted to find someone who was free to take charge of this thankless task... It could have been anyone!
Traveler: Bye.
Honglang: I'll leave exploring this Domain to you while I get your payment ready.
Honglang: Be careful while you explore!
