Traveler: Any recommendations?
Chef Mao: Black-Back Perch Stew is our signature dish. Sure, you might find it in other restaurants too, but I guarantee you it won't taste anywhere near as good as ours.
Chef Mao: A generous helping of fish, cooked with a special blend of chili oil made from Jueyun Chili and Violetgrass. Beautifully tender, bursting with flavor. I've never had a single complaint from anyone who's eaten it!
Chef Mao: ...It's a little spicy for some people, though, so not all would eat it in the first place.
Chef Mao: Why not have a taste? If you like it, you can always buy some more.
