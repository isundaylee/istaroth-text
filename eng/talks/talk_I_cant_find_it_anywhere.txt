Little Nine: I can't find it anywhere...
Traveler: What are you looking for?
Little Nine: A book... Big Nine wrote it specially for me.
Little Nine: I was playing with Big Nine before, he said he had a book for me.
Little Nine: I started reading it and got really into it... I was so into it that I didn't even notice when Big Nine left.
Little Nine: I went to look for him but then I fell in the river... I made it out, finally, but then I lost the book...
Little Nine: #{NICKNAME}, can you help me look for it? That book's really special to Big Nine, if I lose it he will be really sad.
