# Survival Grilled Fish

Keqing's specialty. This dish was not grilled. Instead, it was fried from within through the delicate application of Electro. A gentle bite reveals fragrant fish under the lightly charred skin, its taste perfectly balanced. So, is this how she survives in the wild? You really can't judge a book by its cover.
