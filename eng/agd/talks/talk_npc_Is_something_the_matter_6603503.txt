Traveler: Is something the matter?
Battuta: *panting*... I... Should be fine. My fitness coach left me some daily exercises to get on with, so I'm doing my best to finish them.
Battuta: But to be honest, though I've certainly gotten somewhat fitter after all this time, I still find this back-to-back stair-climbing quite challenging...
Battuta: When the Abyss invaded, my coach went back to her tribe to help out. I have no idea when she'll be back.
Battuta: But I don't want to trouble the couriers with such a trivial matter, especially as my stamina's still lacking...
Battuta: I'm still quite a way from reaching the goals she set for me, so I guess I'd better just grit my teeth and keep chugging on for now.
