Ganyu: I don't know if the thought of the battles ahead is troubling you, but... If so, I do have one suggestion to make.
Ganyu: We should make sure we're well-rested before we proceed! We could find a safe spot to have an afternoon nap, for example.
Ganyu: I, um... I always strive to do things perfectly, but so often I find that the harder I push myself, the more mistakes I end up making.

## Talk 1

Ganyu: I wonder how tough things will get as we keep going? Hmm. Funnily enough, that's a question I rarely ask myself.
Ganyu: I've always felt that so long as I focus on doing everything within my power to complete all of my duties, I'll take whatever troubles lie ahead in my stride.
Ganyu: And if that still doesn't solve the problem... Well, that just means I didn't work as hard as I should've, right?

## Talk 2

Ganyu: Over the centuries, many people and things I was once so close to have slowly faded away. Human lives are short, and sometimes it can feel like nothing of a person's legacy survives.
Ganyu: But there was one time I was listening to a storyteller. To my surprise, their new tale was all about the life of one of my old friends...
Ganyu: As the storyteller spoke, I could almost hear my dear friend's voice and laughter again, and scenes from the past seemed to flash before my eyes... I guess this is why humans like to write stories.
