Traveler: Who are you...?
Gentry De'an: Typical! Young people these days! Care more about what's on their head than what's inside it...
Gentry De'an: I'll have you know that ten years ago, everyone from Feiyun Slope down to the Dockyard knew the name Gentry De'an!
Gentry De'an: Now? The bank's gone, Chu's gone... It's such a pity! I've lived this long only to watch everything fall apart at the end...
