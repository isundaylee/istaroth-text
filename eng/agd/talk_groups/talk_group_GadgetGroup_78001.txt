Paimon: Look here! It's a book named "A Guide to Clandestine Contact With the Fatui"... Paimon wonders if we can find clues regarding the Fatui operation stronghold here...
"A Guide to Clandestine Contact With the Fatui": "At night, go near the tents in Apam Woods. Light four torches there..."
"A Guide to Clandestine Contact With the Fatui": "Then, go towards the signal lights. The stronghold lies where the lights come from..." Wow, so this is how they've been communicating...
"A Guide to Clandestine Contact With the Fatui": "Remember, the code is: Never bring your own rule book to someone else's place..."
Paimon: #They even have a code! Traveler, let's give it a try. "Never bring your own rule book..."
Traveler: "To someone else's place."
Paimon: They say "never bring your own rule book to someone else's place," but hmph! The Fatui brought this contact rule with them to Sumeru...
Paimon: Alright, let's go to Apam Woods and get those Fatui!
