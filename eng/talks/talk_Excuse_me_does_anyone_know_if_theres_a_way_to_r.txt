Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Excuse me, does anyone know if there's a way to restore one's rights as a citizen in Fontaine?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "As far as I know, no such cases currently exist."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Even if there was a way, it'd never happen to you, Colin. Why don't you take an honest look at what you did? That "boiler" prototype of yours razed the entire lab."

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Tell it to the Oratrice, why don't you."
