Turenna: The Wargames are nearly over, Proto-Boss. Su Ding mentioned that your work all went pretty smoothly, yes?
Traveler: It did indeed! How's it all gone for you?
Turenna: It's been great, we've gotten so much out of it!
Turenna: In the Wargames, we came up against many highly mobile opponents, such as flying Fungi.
Turenna: Weapons like muskets, which are slow to fire and require precision, aren't very effective against such foes.
Turenna: To make up for this, we focused on improving our ability to implement rapid rotation tactics in smaller squads. Compared to our previous formation-based way of shooting, our combat style has become a lot more flexible!
Turenna: All in all, these Wargames have helped us identify weaknesses in our tactics, so we now have a much clearer idea of what we need to work on. I'm pumped, to be honest!
Traveler: That's great. See you next time!
Turenna: Yes, yes! And you're welcome to pay us a visit at the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol's headquarters at any time... if you can find it!
