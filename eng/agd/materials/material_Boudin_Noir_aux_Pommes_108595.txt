# Boudin Noir aux Pommes

A traditional Fontainian dish. Fry the apple slices and blood sausage slices separately and serve them on a plate with sauce. Judging by the name of this dish, tourists from other nations often think it should be a dessert, while Boudin Noir is actually just a name for blood sausage.
