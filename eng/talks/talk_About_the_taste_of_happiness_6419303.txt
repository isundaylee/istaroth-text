Traveler: About the "taste of happiness"...
Arasaka: Besides the "taste of happiness," there is also the "taste of sadness."
Arasaka: It's a terrible salty taste, which makes you very sad even with just a small bite.
Arasaka: But Nara seem to like the "taste of sadness." I don't understand this.
Arasaka: Could it be that sharing the "taste of sadness" feels happy, too?
