# Qingxin Flower Cake

A cake made from flowers. Prepared with Qingxin petals still glistening with their morning dew, the filling is wrapped in many layers consisting of two different types of pastry â€” a flaky crust and a buttery dough. Baked to perfection, Qingxin Flower Cakes are best enjoyed fresh from the oven.
