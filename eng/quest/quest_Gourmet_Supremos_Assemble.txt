# Gourmet Supremos, Assemble!


## Talk 1

Xudong: Uh, Parvaneh, are there really branches like that around here?
Parvaneh: I think so. That's what it says here in this book...
Julie: Urgh... I'm starving...
Xudong: Hey, Parvaneh, why don't you look up some other method in your dictionary?
Parvaneh: What do you think I am, omnipotent!? Besides, this isn't a dictionary. It's just a travelogue from the Akademiya!
Xudong: Fine. Just think of a way, please. Otherwise, we'll have to eat grilled fish again.
Parvaneh: Gr—Grilled fish... Ugh, let's just go back to the town and get an adventurer to help, or put up a commission, shall we?
Parvaneh: Isn't that what you used to do back in Liyue when you had a problem?
Xudong: That was Liyue... We're in Inazuma now. We're strangers to this land...
Traveler: What are you all doing?
Xudong: Are you... an adventurer? A traveler? Or both...
Xudong: Well, forget it. Who cares? I guess this is fate.
Xudong: We're the Gourmet Supremos. We're currently traveling around the world in a quest to improve our culinary skills.
Parvaneh: Ugh, I'm begging you, can you please not say that name out loud...
Xudong: Hahaha, come on, it's fine! Anyway, Traveler, are you also going in to collect Sakura Blooms?
Xudong: If so, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. This place has been blocked by some kind of weird contraption. There's no way in.
Traveler: I'm just passing through.
Xudong: Oh, is that so? Alright then. But if it strikes your fancy, it would be nice if you could help us give this barrier a bit of thought.
Xudong: Parvaneh found a method in her book.
Xudong: It says that you need to touch a Thunder Sakura Bough before you can get through this barrier.
Xudong: But as for those Thunder Sakura Boughs... To be honest, we have no idea what they really look like.
Xudong: Well, that's the run-down of our situation. We're still trying to find a way in.
Traveler: Why do you want to get in?
Xudong: We'd like to get some of the Sakura Blooms inside ourselves, of course.
Xudong: I've heard that the Sakura Blooms here have the best mouthfeel, and are perfect for cooking.
Xudong: Well, we'll keep trying our luck around here. Let us know if you find some leads, Traveler.
Parvaneh: ...Mr. Xudong. Is that really how you ask someone for a favor?
Xudong: Eh? *cough* Oh right. Traveler, if you could help us bring some Sakura Blooms out from inside...
Julie: If you could do that, never mind the payment, Xudong here will also make you some really awesome food!
Xudong: You're really good at making these deals, huh, Julie...
Xudong: Well, that's how it is, Traveler. Please help us, if you don't mind.
Traveler: The method you mentioned earlier...
Xudong: Oh? You're really going in?
Xudong: Well, that method was recorded inside Parvaneh's dictionary—
Parvaneh: I told you! It's not a dictionary. It's a travelogue from the Akademiya!
Xudong: Well, whatever the case, she found a way.
Xudong: It says you need to touch a Thunder Sakura Bough before you can get through this barrier.
Xudong: But as for those Thunder Sakura Boughs... To be honest, we have no idea what they really look like.
Parvaneh: There aren't any photos in this book either.
Xudong: I'm officially sick of eating grilled fish. If I can get my hands on some of those Sakura Blooms, I'm sure I can whip something nice up...
Xudong: I've heard that the ones here have the best mouthfeel, and make for perfect cooking ingredients. But why, oh why does there have to be a barrier here...
Xudong: Well, we'll keep trying our luck around here. Let us know if you find some leads, Traveler.
Parvaneh: ...Mr. Xudong. Is that really how you ask someone for a favor?
Xudong: Eh? *cough* Oh right. Traveler, if you could help us bring some Sakura Blooms out from inside...
Julie: If you could do that, never mind the payment, Xudong here will also make you some really awesome food!
Xudong: You're really good at making these deals, huh, Julie...
Xudong: Well, that's how it is, Traveler. Please help us, if you don't mind.

## Talk 2

Xudong: Parvaneh, is there really no other way to do this?
Parvaneh: My book only mentions this one way.
Julie: Heh, if only it was just a bunch of monsters barring our path...
Traveler: Are these the Sakura Blooms you've been looking for?
Xudong: Ah! Yes, that they are! And this color...
Julie: Woohoo! Guess we can finally eat now!
Parvaneh: Wait, you've already passed through that barrier? Did you use the method I told you about?
Traveler: That I did.
Parvaneh: Could you tell me where you found that Thunder Sakura Bough?
Parvaneh: When you touched that Bough, how did the Electrogranum come to rest upon you?
Parvaneh: ...Wait, I'm sorry, let me pull out my notebook. So, did you feel anything after the Electrogranum attached itself to you? And...
Xudong: Parvaneh, please, give this Traveler a moment. They just helped us out... I think your research can wait a bit, right?
Xudong: Thank you very much, Traveler. As we agreed, you will be paid.
Xudong: But before that, just wait here with us for a while. I believe I'll be able to make a dish with the Sakura Blooms you brought.
Xudong: I've heard of an Inazuman specialty known as Sakura Tempura. I suppose now's the time to try it out.
Xudong: Give me a while to prepare. It shouldn't take too long, so come find me in a moment.

## Talk 3

Xudong: It goes like this... and this...
Traveler: Have you finished it yet?
Xudong: Just hold on a moment... wrap it up in flour, put it in to dry...
Xudong: And there we go! Sakura Tempura — try it while it's hot!
Julie: I—It's delicious! ... If a bit too hot...
Parvaneh: Xudong, I believe that this "tempura" also needs to be served with a special dipping sauce...
Xudong: A dipping sauce? Well, I must say that I haven't prepared one of those yet. I'll look into it next time should we get the chance.
Xudong: This serving of Sakura Tempura is yours, Traveler. Please take it as thanks for your help.
Xudong: Ah yes, I'll give you a copy of the recipe too. Just give me a moment to write it down...
Xudong: Try it yourself if you get the chance! Cooking is really fun, you know?
Traveler: Thank you.
Xudong: Don't mention it!
Xudong: We'll be in Inazuma for a while, so I suspect that we might head to *Kannazuka* later.
Xudong: Julie says that she also wants to see that Sacred Sakura Tree at the Grand Narukami Shrine.
Xudong: They say that all the Sakura Blooms on this island fell from that huge tree.
Xudong: I wonder, how large must that tree have been to have so many leaves fall from it...
Xudong: You should pay it a visit if it takes your fancy, too.
Xudong: Thank you for your help once again, Traveler. Well, I'm going to have a bite too. I'm starving...
Traveler: Where will you all be going next?

## Talk 4

Xudong: Parvaneh, is there really no other way to do this?
Parvaneh: My book only mentions this one way.
Julie: Heh, if only it was just a bunch of monsters barring our path...
Traveler: Could you repeat that method of yours to me again?
Parvaneh: Eh, allow me. Basically, you need to search for something nearby known as a Thunder Sakura Bough and touch it.
Parvaneh: After that, something known as an Electrogranum will attach itself to you, and that will allow you to pass through the barrier.
