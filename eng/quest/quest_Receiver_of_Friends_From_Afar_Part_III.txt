# Receiver of Friends From Afar: Part III


## Talk 1

Smiley Yanxiao: #Morning Traveler. Time to fire up the stove for another day of customers. Thanks again!
Black Screen Text: With days of experience now under your belt, the work is becoming second nature...
Smiley Yanxiao: Great work... You're looking more like a head chef every day! Hehe, whatever crazy characters come walking through that door, I know you'll be able to handle them...
Paimon: Wait, no! Every time you say something like that, you jinx it!
Smiley Yanxiao: Hey, that's not true! Anyway, I didn't mean it like that...
Arataki Itto (???): Ahahahaha!
Arataki Itto: Dude! What up, bro!? I didn't know you were in Liyue too! Ah, it's always nice to run into a broad Inazuman fellow... Wait, did I say that right?
Kuki Shinobu: Almost. I think you meant "fellow Inazuman abroad," Boss.
Arataki Itto: Yeah, yeah, that's the one! We gotta look out for each other when we're this far from home! Don't we, Ayato?
Kamisato Ayato: Hehe...
Paimon: ...Bull-Chucker! What are you doing here!?
Arataki Itto: Huh? Oh hey, Flying Lavender Melon... uh, of the "Skycleaving White Iron" variety! And my compadre, too! All my buddies in one place, today's my lucky day!
Paimon: Didn't you say you were gonna knuckle down and earn some Mora when you got home? How come you're back in Liyue so soon?
Arataki Itto: Haha, that can wait. As soon as I announce that Arataki Itto is available for hire, they'll be throwing Mora at me... Right now, I got a more urgent situation to attend to: I'm in the mood for some good, spicy food!
Arataki Itto: ...Oh, and while we're here, we were also gonna see if Grandmaster Hanakado's okay, and whatnot.
Traveler: (The look on Shinobu's face seems to say... "Don't ask.")
Traveler: So what about you, Ayato?
Kamisato Ayato: ...Not too long ago, I heard a rumor that someone was hosting an Onikabuto-fighting contest in Liyue. Naturally, I came here as soon as I could... but alas, it was too late.
Arataki Itto: What? You missed it? Aw man, what a bummer!
Kamisato Ayato: Quite the bummer indeed — though all is not lost. Since you're here, you'll be able to tell me all about it.
Arataki Itto: Haha, sure thing my man! But let's catch up over some food... Where's the chef, anyway? Hey, get the chef out here — I got compadres to feed!
Traveler: I'm the chef.
Arataki Itto: Yeah, sure, me too... What!?
Paimon: Wow, Bull-Chucker set that one up for us really nicely. Gotta give him some credit for that!
Traveler: ...But the main chef is another guy.
Arataki Itto: Uh... Haha, good one compadre, you almost got me there. Alright, well get the chef out here!
Black Screen Text: You and Paimon go to the kitchen and fetch Smiley Yanxiao...
Smiley Yanxiao: So, uh... May I take your order? If you're entertaining guests, I can recommend The Palace Jewels, a Trembling Strings and Rushing Reeds, or...
Kuki Shinobu: ...Boss, don't forget the budget.
Arataki Itto: Yeah, okay, um... Got anything a little more, uh... down to earth?
Smiley Yanxiao: Down to earth...? Oh... Well, we do a mean "Humbly Enough." Real hearty dish with a ton of flavor, and we don't skimp on the portion size either. That'd be the best value for your Mora...
Arataki Itto: Humbly Enough, huh? Sounds like my kind of grub! We'll take that — no need for anything fancy, we're all friends here!
Kamisato Ayato: Excellent choice, Itto — I'm no fan of culinary ostentation either. Heh... sometimes a bro just knows, hmm?
Arataki Itto: A bro just knows... Yes, a bro just knows! Bros don't suppose, 'cause bros just knows!
Paimon: Is this for real? ...Whatever, Paimon's leaving you guys to it.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Uh... Food's here...
Arataki Itto: Oho, so this is Humbly Enough? You guys don't mess around! Love me that portion size!
Arataki Itto: Come on, compadre, grab a seat. We're all friends here, so don't hold back! I'm just gonna dig right in...
Kuki Shinobu: Ahem! Boss, we should respect the local customs. Here in Liyue, it's polite to let the guests eat first.
Arataki Itto: Polite? Uh... Shinobu, I thought old-timey traditions weren't your style...
Traveler: Now that I've finished in the kitchen, I'm a guest too.
Arataki Itto: Huh? Are you kidding me, compadre? ...Ohh wait, I get it. The food smells so dang good, now everyone's dying to go first! Well, guess I only got my own good taste to blame. Go on, dive in, I'll wait till last!
Kamisato Ayato: ...
Black Screen Text: You, Paimon, Ayato, and Shinobu help yourselves, leaving very little "meat" behind...
Kamisato Ayato: ...Hah, I see.
Arataki Itto: Finally, it's my turn! Hoohoo, I spy a big chunk of deliciousness with my name on it...
Paimon: Wait, don't!
Arataki Itto: Huh? What is it now?
Traveler: You got this, Paimon.
Paimon: Uh... Okay, here goes... Anyway, so uh, Paimon forgot to tell you the really cool origin story of this dish!
Arataki Itto: Origin story? Dude, who cares where it came from — we all know where it's going! Am I right? Down the gullet!
Paimon: Uh, well, umm... Skipping the origin story is like... like going traveling without a tour guide! Trust Paimon, you'll get way more out of the experience after you hear it...
Kamisato Ayato: Paimon makes an astute observation. Much as every tea must be appreciated on its own terms, is it not a waste of the chef's goodwill to sample a dish without hearing its tale?
Arataki Itto: My compadre's goodwill, huh? Can't have that going to waste... Alright then, gimme the full story! I'm all ears!
Paimon: That's more like it! Let's start with the ingredients... Actually, no, let's start with the story of Wangshu Inn... which starts with the history of Dihua Marsh...
Kuki Shinobu: #(Now's our chance, Traveler!)
Traveler: (Got it!)
Black Screen Text: While Itto is distracted, you and Shinobu begin to gobble down the dish...
Arataki Itto: ...Man, the tale of Dihua Marsh hits hard... People in the past had it pretty rough. Makes you appreciate what you got. "Humbly enough"... that's a good way to think about life.
Paimon: (Darn, there's no segue to tofu from here... How'd we get so off topic? Ugh. Well, good news is there's only a little bit left!)
Traveler: (But we're already... beyond stuffed...)
Arataki Itto: Aaah! Compadre, Shinobu! Have you been eating this whole time!? Save me some dregs, why don't ya!
Arataki Itto: That's it, I'm done waiting! It's my turn to eat!
Kuki Shinobu: Wait! Boss, that's made of—
Kamisato Ayato: One moment, Itto. I... have a small request, if you would be so kind as to consider it.
Kamisato Ayato: I left home in a hurry, and was unable to bring any of my family with me. They've all heard so much about you and are huge admirers of the Arataki Gang, so they will be devastated to learn that they missed out on this opportunity.
Kamisato Ayato: However... if you were willing to let me bring the remaining portion of Humbly Enough back to them, I'm sure it will help to lift their spirits.
Arataki Itto: Ehh... Yeah, I dunno...
Kuki Shinobu: Boss, you gotta do right by your friends. They're pretty big on that in Liyue... Besides, you did eat quite a lot of the grilled fish while we were waiting for the main course...
Kuki Shinobu: ...Including mine and Ayato's.
Arataki Itto: Huh? Those were for you guys!? Ah, dang it... I got too carried away telling that story, didn't I...
Arataki Itto: Ah, in that case... Pass my regards to your fam, bro! El Chefe, can we get the rest of this to go?
Traveler: You know the drill...
Traveler: Maybe let me dig in first?

## Talk 3

Smiley Yanxiao: Looks like that's all sorted? Alright, take some time to collect yourself — the next big group is coming in.
Black Screen Text: The rest of the day passes without incident...

## Talk 4

Smiley Yanxiao: Gotta say, your friend's quite a character... Still, Humbly Enough isn't that hard to make, so I don't think we'll have any problems with this order.
Paimon: Actually, why is it called "Humbly Enough" anyway? A hearty meat dish is a good start, but in Paimon's experience, one humble dish is never enough!
Smiley Yanxiao: Uh, I said it was hearty, but I never said it contained meat... Don't be fooled by the appearance — it's actually just tofu made to look and taste like meat.
Traveler: Tofu!?
Paimon: Wait! Tofu is made of beans, isn't it... Bull-Chucker can't eat that! Guess we'll have to get them to pick something else instead...
Kuki Shinobu: ...What's the issue? I think I caught the word "tofu"...
Smiley Yanxiao: Wait, what are you doing? The kitchen is staff members only... *sigh* Never mind, I'll let it slide. Ma'am, could you possibly ask your Boss to order something else instead?
Arataki Itto: ...Haha! No one gets my bro Ayato like I do! I hereby declare that Humbly Enough will be an everlasting symbol of our friendship, or my name ain't Arataki Itto!
Arataki Itto: ...Hey! Where's our food at? Hurry up, I'm almost done recounting the epic adventures of Crimson Staff!
Kuki Shinobu: ...As you can see, changing the order may be a little difficult.
Paimon: Oh brother, his whole ego is riding on this, huh... Even if we break the news to him, he'd probably rather eat the tofu than eat his words...
Traveler: We're locked in now... We gotta cook that dish...
Kuki Shinobu: Sounds good. I'll make sure he fills up on those... We'll just have to play the rest by ear.
Traveler: How about we throw some free appetizers in?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Smiley Yanxiao: Oil, salt, sauce, vinegar... Right, that's everything we need.

### Additional Talk 2

Huai'an: #Why, Traveler, this year's off to a good start, wouldn't you say?

### Additional Talk 3

Kuki Shinobu: The air was getting stifling, so I made some excuses and slipped away... Anyway, thanks for taking the hint earlier. I'll fill you in later.

### Additional Talk 4

Smiley Yanxiao: I never knew tofu allergy was even a thing... Okay, I'll handle the appetizers, you take care of the main event.
Kuki Shinobu: I can help, too. Don't worry, I'm qualified — I passed Liyue's senior culinary exam once.

### Additional Talk 5

Arataki Itto: ...Seriously, if I'd blinked I would've missed it! Crimson Staff just launched itself at Bloom Pruner and sent it flying!
Kamisato Ayato: I'd expect no less of the Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King himself. It sounds like a truly epoch-defining duel.

### Additional Talk 6

Kamisato Ayato: "Count Crushmore," "Instant Kill"... I never knew there were so many elite beetle-fighters in Liyue.
Traveler: You didn't really come for the Onikabuto-fighting contest, did you...?
Kamisato Ayato: Heh, can you imagine? That would be tardiness of the most unfashionable variety. No, in truth, this trip is part-business, part-leisure.
Traveler: How come you didn't come to the Lantern Rite then?
Kamisato Ayato: Every visitor has their own agenda. For some, the festivities are all the more reason to visit, for others, all the more reason to avoid the crowds.
Kamisato Ayato: In any case, one way or another I seem to have ended up in the right place at the right time... Now, as for the leftover tofu... yes, I'm sure Thoma will dispose of it as he sees fit.

### Additional Talk 7

Arataki Itto: I have to get back to the docks as soon as this meal is done...
Traveler: So, why did you really come to Liyue?
Arataki Itto: Well, uh... thing is...
Kuki Shinobu: ...I can explain. Boss recently found work as a sailor, which allowed him to hitch a ride here.
Kuki Shinobu: After the ship docked, he had some free time to do as he pleases. He's been using that time to hang out with Grandmaster Hanakado.
Arataki Itto: Just because he's here already! No other reason!
