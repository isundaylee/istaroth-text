Traveler: About Raw Meat...
Amir: Yeah, I did post a commission on Raw Meat.

Traveler: I'm ready.

Amir: Well, it's no small amount, just let me know when you're ready then.

Traveler: About the lady beside you...
Amir: Hey, keep it down! You mean that lady over there named Lisa?
Amir: Lisa... Lisa, what a beautiful, elegant name.
Amir: Too bad you didn't see it. She spoke to me just now, asking about Sag's name, hehe...
Amir: She also seems to have a love for animals. But she doesn't seem to know how to deal with them.
Amir: I could tell by the way she had just touched Sag, but it doesn't matter. I can teach her.
Amir: We could raise lots of dogs together...
Amir: ...
Amir: (He gets lost in thought talking to himself.)

Traveler: These guys?
Amir: Yeah, these fluffy guys. They just refuse to sit still, and they keep running around and making noise all day.
Amir: Luckily, they get serious when it's time for work. Otherwise, I would have taught them another good lesson.

Traveler: That girl?
Amir: Oh... She's a Trainee Forest Ranger with us.
Amir: She... is in poor health, so she's here to learn and recuperate at the same time.
Amir: She's so young yet so eager to excel. I'm still quite worried about her condition.
Amir: That's why I asked the search and rescue dogs to pay attention to her condition and notify me immediately if something happens. That's the only way I can be there in time to help her.

Traveler: So, who's that girl?
Amir: Oh... She's a Trainee Forest Ranger who's currently stationed with us.
Amir: She's only just recovered from a very serious illness, but it seems that she's been trying a bit too hard recently.
Amir: She's been all over the shop, so much so that I've started to worry that she might go running off into a storm again just to rescue someone.
Amir: That's why I've asked our search and rescue dogs to pay attention to her condition and notify me immediately if something happens. That's the only way that I can be there in time to help her.

Traveler: Fluffy... Forest Watchers?
Amir: Haha, I think you've misunderstood. I didn't mean my colleagues, I meant these doggies.
Amir: They may seem like they're all over the place, but they're actually very reliable. They're good friends and assistants for our forest patrol work.
Amir: As for myself, I am responsible for managing and training these search and rescue dogs.
Amir: Sag is my best student, so I appointed it captain of the search and rescue dog team. If you can't find a Forest Watcher or a Forest Ranger, you can ask it for help too.

Traveler: I can help too.
Amir: That means a lot to me. Ah, how I wish more kind people like you would join the Forest Rangers.
