Kun: Hello there, Traveler. I guess you're here to celebrate the Lantern Rite?
Kun: Well, what do you think? Quite the lively festival, wasn't it? I mean, especially the fireworks show that Lady Keqing organized. Ah, that was one for the history books for sure.
Kun: I hope you can enjoy yourself to the fullest. If you need anything, just come to me!
