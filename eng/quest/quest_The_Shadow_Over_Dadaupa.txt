Traveler: (There's nothing inside...)
Traveler: (Let's keep looking elsewhere...)

### Additional Talk 1

Draff: Herbal soup? I've got some right here... *hic* I'm sure of it!
Diona: He's not sobering up any time soon. I'll stay here and keep an eye on the drunk old fart. Good luck!
Draff: Take it... the herbal soup is in my flask. I still have that hilihog to catch! Or wait, was it a hilihound...? *hic* Well, it don't matter...
