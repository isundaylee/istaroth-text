Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Is there anything you'd like to do?</color>
Albedo: Heh, where should I begin...?
Albedo: In your company, I never lack inspiration.
Traveler: For drawing?
Albedo: It's good for both drawing and experiments.
Albedo: And not just for these, but for many other things.
Albedo: Speaking of which... I used to think interaction with others was a waste of time.
Albedo: But after meeting you, I'd rather spend my time on you than other matters.
Albedo: This is a unique anomaly. I think I likely know the reason why.
Albedo: So can you also... give me more of your time?
Traveler: I'll accompany you while you sketch.
Albedo: Thank you. Then, today's subjectâ€”
Albedo: You and your realm.
Albedo: By the way, after we're done, may I have the pleasure of inviting you to dessert with me?
Albedo: To continue our time together, and to thank you for your company.
Traveler: I'll accompany you during your experiments.
Albedo: Thank you. I'll guarantee your safety, as I've done before.
Albedo: We already understand each other quite well, don't we?
Traveler: For experiments?
