# License to Glide


## Talk 1

Traveler: I mean, I read it but...
Traveler: I can't say I really grasped the rules...
Amber: Great, you're here! Did you have a good read-through of the gliding manual? Got all the rules down?
Amber: Sounds like it was a real drag. I would know, I've been there...
Amber: The gliding manual is super dry... I couldn't get into it at all. Don't tell Jean though...
Paimon: Really? Hmm... Paimon thought there were some pretty cool stories in the gliding manual.
Amber: Cool stories? Oh, you must mean the example cases in the Appendix.
Amber: Some of them I like. My favorite one is about the illegal Anemo Slime take-off.
Amber: Apparently, if you pop an Anemo Slime and take off in the burst of wind, it shoots you up really, really high... I really wanna try it!
Paimon: No, not that story. Paimon meant the one with the little bird who wanted to learn to fly.
Amber: Ah... What...?
Amber: Lemme take a look... Shoot, this is the storybook I used to read as a kid!
Amber: Oops, sorry! I put both books in the same pile and must have grabbed the wrong one when I was leaving.
Paimon: How in the heck do you confuse a bedtime story with an instruction manual?
Amber: Ahh... This is so embarrassing...
Amber: It's because... Maybe deep down inside, that fairytale is the thing that truly taught me how to glide...
Amber: "What you lacked was not wind. It's courage that's allowed you to become the first flying birds of this world."
Amber: Reading that gave me the courage to glide, to become an Outrider, and to become the Gliding Champion of Mondstadt.
Amber: ...But anyway, let's get back to the exam!
Amber: Don't be nervous, just glide like you're used to.
Traveler: I'm ready.
Amber: Okay then. You just need to follow the <color=#00E1FFFF>marked route</color> to the finish.

## Talk 2

Amber: You nailed it! But it's no surprise, given the way you handle your glider in a storm.
Amber: The next part of the exam is in Mondstadt. See you there, don't keep me waiting!
