# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Do you like it here?
Kirara: Oh, is this like a user feedback form? Ahem, time to get serious then.
Kirara: First, five stars for the environment! The view here is beyond breathtaking, I'm talking a once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience, and on top of that, there is definitely some kind of youkai power here that I can't put my finger on just yet.
Kirara: Second, five stars for comfort! I've been getting some great nights' sleep in my box.
Kirara: There's been no noise, no bright lights, no nothing! I couldn't have asked for anything more!
Kirara: And finally... another five stars for service! There's really nothing for me to nitpick in this category.
Traveler: Such a high rating... Thank you.
Kirara: You deserve all the praise! I'm the one that should be thanking you.
Traveler: Anything else you'd like to add?
Kirara: Huh? Did I miss one? ...Oh wait, I get it â€” this is the open-ended question where I can mention anything that hasn't already been covered.
Kirara: Alright, let me think...
Kirara: I've taken quite an interest in that huge Emerald Finch. She looks chubby and fluffy, and seems to be going through life without a care in the world...
Traveler: That's Tubby, a teapot spirit.
Kirara: A teapot spirit? You mean like a Tsukumogami? Are you saying her original form is an actual teapot?
Kirara: Or are you saying this is in fact her original form, but she can turn into a human girl just like me?
Kirara: Ahh! This is so exciting! You have to introduce me to her!
Traveler: You are NOT allowed to eat her.
Kirara: Oh, of course not, I would never do that!
Kirara: A little curiosity never hurt anyone, right? I just want to know where she comes from, what she does or thinks about, who knows, we may just end up becoming friends!
Kirara: If you get a chance, please introduce me to her!
Traveler: You answered everything so seriously...
Kirara: You've done so much work around here, it's the least I can do to tell you exactly how I feel.
