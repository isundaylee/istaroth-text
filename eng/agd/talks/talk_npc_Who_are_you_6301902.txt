Traveler: Who are you?
Owada: I'm the Yoriki of the Police Station, the superior of every Doushin here. Just call me Owada.
Owada: The Police Station is in charge of keeping order and peace. If you see anything out of order, you can come here and report it to us...
Owada: That being said, I still hope that nothing comes up. May the Electro Archon bless us all.
