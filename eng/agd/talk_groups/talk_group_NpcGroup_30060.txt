## Talk

Barbara: Honorary Knight, good timing! Would you like to watch the ocean together?
Traveler: Do you want to chat?
Barbara: Okay, is there anything you wanted to talk about?
Traveler: Tell me about Ludi Harpastum...
Barbara: You're probably familiar already but, Ludi Harpastum is a traditional Mondstadt festival.
Barbara: During the festivities, we throw beautiful, brightly-colored harpasta into the air. It's a way for us to commemorate the Anemo Archon and send them glad tidings. A festival for all ages!
Barbara: Klee loves Ludi Harpastum. Still, it's not quite here yet... so I made her that special harpastum.
Barbara: I hope it cheers her up. She has such a contagious smile, I can't help but smile myself when I see her... such a great feeling.
Traveler: Tell me about these islands...
Barbara: I know my sister is always telling us to keep our guards up, but for me, these islands are a lot of fun.
Barbara: Sitting on the beach, looking out into the starry summer sky, humming along to the rolling waves...
Barbara: It's so romantic...
Barbara: And with you here, the summer feels just that much more special.
Traveler: Tell me about yourself...
Barbara: Oh... me?
Barbara: Well, I—I... Actually, I...
Barbara: *sigh* You wanna know the truth?
Barbara: I only came to the islands out of concern for everyone's safety... Though, I admit.... that I didn't want to miss out on traveling together with all of you either.
Barbara: I—I hope you won't laugh at me. After all, a deaconess shouldn't concern herself with matters of fun and games...
Traveler: I wouldn't dare.
Barbara: Phew... then I'm glad.
Traveler: About what happened today...
Barbara: I had no idea the others would be here, too. It was so nice to have everyone suddenly together like that.
Barbara: I want to use this opportunity to get closer to everyone... especially my sister.
Barbara: It might just be her personality, but she's always incredibly busy. She carries a lot on her shoulders.
Barbara: I hope she can start to take more time for herself and relax a little more... At the very least, I hope I can make her happy when I'm around.
Barbara: I wonder if I should sing her a song? Hmm...
Traveler: I won't disturb you.
Barbara: No problem, see you later!

## Talk

Barbara: It's amazing! This whole island... is actually a gift?
Barbara: ...Honorary Knight, I—I can't help but feel a little emotional. Of course, it wasn't my gift... but I just feel so moved by it all.
Barbara: When people spend a long time together, they become... more important to each other.
Barbara: *sigh* ...A good reminder. In fact, many things have become clearer to me now.
