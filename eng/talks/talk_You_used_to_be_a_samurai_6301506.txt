Traveler: You used to be a samurai?
Shimura Kanbei: Hmm? Oh yeah... But it's been decades. Nothing worth talking about.
Shimura Kanbei: I was too naive back then. I only thought of serving and dying for the cause, or building some track record, or becoming a Hatamoto.
Shimura Kanbei: I kept going until my hair turned gray and my parents were long gone...
Shimura Kanbei: At that point, I finally realized that I was all alone in this world, and yet I still hadn't figured out who I was supposed to be yet...
Shimura Kanbei: Thankfully, I still have this restaurant. I've been working at it for decades.
Shimura Kanbei: Can you imagine it? It took decades for me to realize that I'm more suitable to being a small business owner than a warrior.
