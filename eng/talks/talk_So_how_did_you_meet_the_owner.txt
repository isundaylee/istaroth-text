Traveler: So, how did you meet the owner?
Okazaki Erika: You're asking about us? Well, that's a tough question. It's a long story with a side of karma, that's for sure.

Okazaki Erika: *sigh* Forget it. I can only thank the archons that this person eventually retired, and we could finally get married after that. Thank the archons, indeed!
