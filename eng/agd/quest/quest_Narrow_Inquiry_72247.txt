(Quest is part of chapter: Hyperion's Dirge)

# Narrow Inquiry


## Talk 1

Aberaku: Are you fully girded up, Traveler?

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'm ready.
Aberaku: Then I wish you... every success in your battle ahead.

## Talk 3

Aberaku: It seems that your strength is more than sufficient to help escort the enshrined items...
Aberaku: This way, I can finally rest easy. Those items must be sent, in order to...
Paimon: In order to what now?
Aberaku: In order to... In order to...
Paimon: Uh-oh. Looks like he's gone into broken-clock mode.
Paimon: But the offerings he was talking about were probably these items... As slightly beat-up as they might look.

## Talk 4

Paimon: S—Something's coming out!
Paimon: Looks like some kind of afterimage again.
Aberaku: My name is...
Aberaku: Aberaku, Helios-Forger!
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon knows this one.
Paimon: So what he's saying is—
Paimon: That he's Helios-Forger, right?
Traveler: Were you even listening to him?
Paimon: Oh...
Paimon: Aberaku... What a weird name.
Paimon: Wait, but if he's Aberaku, what's the Helios?
Aberaku: Ah, Helios! Helios!
Aberaku: Mine own creation... Helios! When it was finished, its light spread from horizon to horizon, and thus were the people spared from the dragon-scourge!
Aberaku: How the people gazed upon it then! How they wept hot tears, raised their arms with joyful cries, unable to restrain their intense emotions!
Aberaku: ...No, wait. Wh—Why am I here? Why has my soul become lost in the realm of dreams, unable to find rest?
Traveler: Did you get that this time, Paimon?
Paimon: Sure did.
Paimon: This spirit seems... disturbed.
Aberaku: I remember now! My soul is rent! If it can be made whole, I can be at peace once more.
Aberaku: In this task must you play a critical role, and so I say unto you...
Paimon: Uh-oh, here comes trouble...
Aberaku: A portion of my bones should be enshrined in this place, but they have long rotted away... Please, I beseech you...
Aberaku: Take these articles that carry my remnant thoughts with you... There are, however, monsters abound here who keep my soul entrapped, and they will swarm over once an object within which my soul rests is removed.
Aberaku: This matter is perilous. Tell me once you are ready, O Traveler, and we shall begin.
Traveler: No, his name's Aberaku.
