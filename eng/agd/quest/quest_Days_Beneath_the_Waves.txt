# Days Beneath the Waves


## Talk 1

Yves: Phew... Seriously... What awful luck...
Traveler: You're a diver?
Yves: That's right. I mean, I'm wearing my divesuit, aren't I? Anyway, do you need some sort of help?
Yves: If that's the case, I'm afraid you're out of luck... I won't be diving anywhere — not for the time being, anyway.
Yves: The waters here are too complicated a maze. Dive even a little deeper, and not only will the current be enormously chaotic, but waterweeds and trash in their swarm will eagerly seize me by the legs.
Yves: All it took was a moment of distraction, and a piece of metal had pierced my divesuit, causing it to leak.
Yves: Fortunately, I wasn't far from shore, and even then it was a life-and-death game I played to get my feet back on dry land. The dive suit was damaged, but thankfully, my leg is mostly fine... I haven't much Mora for medical consultation.
Yves: But I don't think I'll be able to finish the work that Goldman's assigned. In fact, I might even need to pay that stingy fellow. What luck, huh?
Traveler: It's good that you're safe, though.
Yves: Quite the consoling figure you cut... But you're not wrong. Apart from my healthy body, I haven't anything else on my person.
Yves: *sigh* Anyway, I won't be able to help you much. I need to get this divesuit patched up and continue trawling underwater trash for Goldman...
Traveler: I can help you.
Yves: Thanks for your kindness, but diving isn't something just anyone can do. Besides, I don't even have much Mora to pay you with.
Traveler: I know how to dive.
Yves: #*sigh* Alright, alright. This hole is indeed too large for me to fix immediately, so I can only rely on your help, good sir.
Yves: You've got a good heart. I've hardly any doubt that you must be beloved by all.
Yves: That greedy greaseball Goldman always sends us the worst jobs — if the things he wants found aren't lost in the deepest waters, they're buried underground...
Yves: Let me mark the necessary locations for you one by one...
Yves: Alright, I've marked the various locations out. I'm counting on you, alright? Ugh, I can't believe the divesuit's this badly damaged... How much Mora will I have to fork out?
Traveler: Don't worry, I can do this.
Traveler: Why don't I help you perform some salvage?
Traveler: Who's Goldman?
Yves: Him? Hmph, he's my boss — a specialist in hiring folks like me with no skills, but plenty of strength to spare in order to make ends meet.
Yves: A real Fonta-for-brains he is, and he's strict and stingy to boot! He insists that we stick to that big, thick work manual while at work...
Yves: Also, even the divesuits we use at work are stuff he "rents" out to us.
Yves: If we violate those stipulations or our divesuits get damaged, we'll have to pay him instead...
Yves: In other words, if I get careless at work even once, not only will I need to pay him a fee, but I'll need to grovel and beg him to keep me on staff! Pah!
Traveler: Did you just finish your dive?

## Talk 2

Yves: That rapacious rogue...
Traveler: How's your divesuit?
Yves: Ah, it's you! Sight for sore eyes, you are — best I've seen all day.
Yves: I'm sure you don't know what fresh new torture Goldman cooked up for us...
Yves: He hired some number cruncher, real calculating sort, to figure out how many objects each of us can salvage each day.
Yves: Then he forced us to haul salvage ashore based on these calculations!
Yves: But I mean, we get tired, get injured, grow hungry, and sometimes we just don't have energy. We can't simply haul that much out every single time. But does Goldman care? No!
Yves: If we can't match that quota, he scolds us and even docks our pay!
Yves: Not that this is the bean counter's fault. He's a good fellow named Finnegan, a real sympathetic type.
Yves: While he was doing his calculations, he would consult us regarding our daily work. One day, when he'd finished hearing what we had to say and done his sums...
Yves: He then stood up all of a sudden, ran into Goldman's house, and began yelling at that rogue.
Yves: I heard him say "...This is unreasonable — they're people, not machines!"
Yves: ...He wound up being thrown out by Goldman's underlings and fell into a puddle. We had to help him up and out of it.
Yves: How the fellow apologized — wept, even. I couldn't blame him, none of us could. He's one of Goldman's victims just like us.
Yves: He promised that he'd think of some way to help us get justice... But really, we all hope he never comes back to this cesspit.
Traveler: How much longer do you still have to work today?
Yves: A ton, I'm afraid. Can't say when I'll be done either. Just gotta do as much as I can, and hope I don't get docked too much Mora... All I can do is find someone to lend me a divesuit so I can work.
Traveler: Let me help you out.
Yves: Really? You'd still help me out?
Yves: You... really are my savior. If only that Goldman had half your good heart! ... Oh, no. I'm so sorry, I shouldn't even have compared that boorish boar to you.
Yves: As before, I'll mark the location of the objects for you, then we'll split up and search. *sigh* I'm done for if I damage this borrowed divesuit, too...
Traveler: Let me share your load.
Traveler: How much work have you got left today?

## Talk 3

Yves: These are... What are all these trinkets? Are these what Goldman really wanted us to salvage?
Yves: Thanks so much for your help! Here... Take this Mora, and don't tell a soul about this.
Yves: If I could sell these, I can purchase a divesuit of my own. No longer would I need to rent from that Goldman!
Traveler: I can't take this from you.
Yves: No, no! This is the wages you deserve. I know this is nothing compared to the effort you had to put in, but it's all I have left. I was planning to get a swig of booze with it tonight...
Yves: So please, take it. I'll take care of a few things, and then I'll figure out how to... y'know, sell this on the sly...
Traveler: My lips are sealed.

## Talk 4

Yves: Have you helped me salvage those things?

## Talk 5

Yves: That's right, this is what we go trawling for every day. It's just junk, junk, and more junk... Maybe that stingy rogue Goldman eats the stuff...
Yves: Thanks for your help. This is the pay I got as an advance from Goldman — please take it.
Traveler: I can't take this from you.
Yves: But you must! It's your wages for YOUR work. It no longer belongs to me... and if you won't take it, I'm just going to consign this coin pouch to the waters.
Traveler: Alright, alright...
Yves: That's the way! If you need anything salvaged in the future, come look for me. I'll get it out for you in one piece, no matter what it is!
Yves: But for now, I've got to continue repairing my divesuit. *sigh* Isn't this hole a little too big...

## Talk 6

Yves: Pah, that stingy rogue!
Traveler: Could you tell me about Goldman again?
Yves: He's my boss — real specialist in hiring folks like me with no skills, but strength to spare in order to make ends meet.
Yves: A real Fonta-for-brains he is, and he's strict and stingy to boot! He insists that we stick to that big, thick work manual while at work...
Yves: Also, even the divesuits we use at work are stuff he "rents" out to us.
Yves: If we violate those stipulations or our divesuits get damaged, we'll have to pay him instead...
Yves: In other words, if I get careless at work even once, not only will I need to pay him a fee, but I'll need to grovel and beg him to keep me on staff! Pah!
Yves: What do you want to know more about him for, anyways? I'm begging you, please, keep your distance from him — even if it's just for your good name's sake!
Yves: Shameless, that's what he is, and he surrounds himself with some of like kind to him, too. Bad eggs, them.
Yves: Don't associate with that fellow — you'd not clean that mud and filth off your hands, not even with a tower's worth of pure water.
Yves: But see, it takes nary any effort to stain a clear pond using dirty mud.
Traveler: You do some really hard work...
Yves: Hah, and isn't that the truth? But this is the only way I can make a living. I'm not smart, and I don't have any other skills, but I'm not going to turn to crime, either.
Yves: If I must do evil to get the bread, then I'd rather go hungry!
Yves: My lot's rough, yes, but I can close my eyes in peace at night. No need to fear if anyone hates me, or might shank me in my sleep.
Yves: If you think about it that way, my life's way better than Goldman's.
Traveler: See you.
Yves: #Sure. I'll leave the salvage work to you, good sir. As for me, I'm going to continue repairing that divesuit of mine...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Yves: Agh, what terrible luck...
Traveler: Were you able to sell the stuff?
Yves: Ah, it's you. Ugh, forget it. I'd just found a buyer too, and that was when Goldman barged into my house and seized that box of trinkets!
Yves: If he didn't still need me to work for him, I'd have taken a real beating, too... He did deduct two months' salary, though...
Yves: He wants to pay me only after I've finished this whole year's worth of work.
Yves: *sigh* Forget it. Luck doesn't smile on idiots like me... Wait. Goldman didn't come knocking at your door, did he?
Traveler: No.
Yves: Good, then. Me getting beat up? Totally fine. But I would never want to get you in trouble with him.
Yves: I didn't tell him about your salvage work, but I suspect that someone else found out and told him...
Yves: Still, I will need your help today again. My divesuit still hasn't been fixed, but Goldman's been pushing me to make up for the days where I was unable to finish work...
Yves: I had no choice but to borrow someone else's divesuit, but even so, I couldn't finish my work quickly enough... Unfortunately, I'm gonna have to rely on your goodwill again.
Traveler: No issue.
Yves: Thank you. I'll mark the locations of the objects in question for you — we'll split up and search... I'll go repair that divesuit of mine after the work is done.
Traveler: Allow me.
Traveler: If he did come to me, I'd have a lesson to teach him.
Yves: Please, don't get involved with that shameless lump of lard! Someone as honorable as yourself shouldn't even be acquainted with him!
