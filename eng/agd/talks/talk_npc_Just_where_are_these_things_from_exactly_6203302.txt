Traveler: Just where are these things from exactly?
Zhang Shun: What? You think they're stolen?
Zhang Shun: Of course not, I'm a sailor with The Crux. They're the spoils of years of service.
Zhang Shun: But I got injured during the battle against Haishan. If it weren't for Captain Beidou, I'd be a goner.
Zhang Shun: So I decided it best I leave The Crux. Can't have a crewmate's old injury flaring up and dragging the crew under...
Zhang Shun: At least the things I collected over the years is enough to keep me going though.
