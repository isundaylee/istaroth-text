Sucrose: Alright, let me give your potion a try... Yep, the effect looks good. The quality of your potion is quite high as well. Your talent in this discipline is truly remarkable.
Paimon: So, we passed? Can we teach alchemy now?
Lisa: What an amazing achievement, cuties. Congratulations.
Traveler: I guess we've learned a thing or two about potion-making.
Lisa: Now is not the time to be humble.
Lisa: You mastered potion-making in such a short amount of time. That's an impressive achievement no matter how you look at it.
Sucrose: Exactly! I was also really surprised at how quickly you picked it up. I thought it would have taken way more time...
Sucrose: Anyway, thank you so much for your help. Your participation has allowed me to collect some very valuable data. With everything we've learned, we should be able to offer the official exams soon.
Sucrose: This is sure to be a critical moment in the development of the alchemical potions industry.
Paimon: Paimon feels like she just took part in something super important!
Sucrose: Of course! You two are practically pioneers! What you've been able to contribute to the field of alchemy is as impressive as a biologist discovering a new species!
Sucrose: Anyway... I should probably head back and go over the data I've collected.
Sucrose: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon, thanks again for your participation. If you have some free time, please stop by the lab!
Traveler: But we're still by no means experts when it comes to everything else.
