Fischl: I behold the magnificent vistas of three thousand worlds and am intimately acquainted with the threads of past and future.
Fischl: Feebly does the expanse that appears before me endeavor to capture my attention.

Oz: But mein Fr√§ulein, you previously said that you wished to stay here for a while.
Fischl: #That... that was but to demonstrate solidarity for {F#her}{M#him} as a kindred soul of the outrealm!
