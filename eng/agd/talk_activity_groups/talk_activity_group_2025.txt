Pops Zhou: Haha, young folks these days... Always brimming with new ideas.
Pops Zhou: A poetry gala... Ah, thinking back on my youth, I certainly had stories I could put to paper back then...
Pops Zhou: *sigh* ...The world is eternal, but youth is ephemeral...

## Talk

Jifang: Now then, didn't you say you wanted to publish a book?
Hu Tao: Yes, I do.
Jifang: ...So where's the book?
Hu Tao: It's in the works! Just waiting on the poems!
Jifang: ...And where are the poems?
Hu Tao: They're on the way.
Jifang: ...Look, I'm sorry Director Hu, but how do you expect me to talk business with you when you don't even have the poems yet?
Hu Tao: I just figured while we're waiting, we could discuss terms in advance.
Jifang: Well, I need to see the content to decide if I even want to sell it, let alone how much to sell it for.
Hu Tao: Oh, come on, I showed you a sample already, and it was some of my finest work! Besides, you only need a few highlights to sell an anthology!
Jifang: ...You think your poem, "Fifteen Tenderloin Steaks" will carry the whole book, do you?
Hu Tao: That and "Square Meals In the Basement"! My consultant, the erudite Mr. Zhongli, described it as a meticulous masterpiece! Ooh â€” quote that on the cover! It'll practically sell itself!
Jifang: ...Director, we're a small business. If we invest money in printing and nobody buys it, it's my bottom line that's affected.
Hu Tao: Don't you worry! I guarantee you, when this anthology comes out, it will take the world by storm! Gods and ghosts alike will weep!
Hu Tao: As a matter of fact, I heard a ghost crying on the way here. If you don't believe me, I can bring it over?
Jifang: ...There'll be no need for that.

Huanxi: It's nice to have a chance to write poetry with our friends from Mondstadt.

## Talk

Levin: I heard that they specially sent someone over from The Cat's Tail as the mixologist for this event.

Message Board (Message): I think the answer to the riddle on the left is "Glaze Lily."
Message Board (Reply): But according to the riddle, these flowers were once everywhere... Were there really that many Glaze Lilies?
Message Board (Reply): What about Mint? The poem did say something about the plant being fragrant.
Message Board (Reply): I still think Glaze Lilies fit the description better.
Message Board (Reply): Has anyone solved the riddle on the right? I'm running out of ideas. Wait, could it be something I've never seen before?
Message Board (Reply): I know what it is, but I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to tell...
Message Board (Reply): C'mon, it's just the answer to a riddle!

## Talk

Message Board (Message): If I remember correctly, Liyue's couplets can be quite difficult to write...
Message Board (Reply): Yeah, it's harder if you follow the rules and try to match every word.
Message Board (Reply): Apart from having exactly the same number of syllables, you have to take note of certain tonal patterns and make the words rhyme...
Message Board (Reply): Anyway, it's a rare opportunity to have guests visiting from Mondstadt, so let's all just enjoy ourselves.

Message Board (Someone's Poem): "I want to hide within the foot of the tree, unless a forest boar happens to discover me. Then it'll put me atop its head, as if I'm a crown of flowers made."
Message Board (Someone's Poem): "You see, I didn't want this fungal metamorphosis, because it's just an excuse for loneliness."
