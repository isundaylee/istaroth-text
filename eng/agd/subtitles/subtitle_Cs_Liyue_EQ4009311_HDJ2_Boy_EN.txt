I'm honored to be here on the Iridescence Tour stage!
Alright, without further ado, I'm Xinyan, this is Hu Tao...
And this is a li'l something called:
"The Blaze Lilies!"
I'm up here blazin' trails through the midnight sky, lightin' up the world below
And when the crowds all hear my voice, they'll meet the spirit of rock n' roll
Let's go! / Hey you, butterfly / You too, buzzin' by / Guidin' your way / To the afterlife
Openin' the path without a fright / Oh!
I'll light the fire / Watch it blaze / 'cross the universe
I'll spit my rhymes / Watch your step / Or you'll get burned
Does anyone have any plans tomorrow?
With another year behind us, I think we deserve a celebration of our own
My treat, interested?
The Tianquan footing the bill? I can't miss out on that
...
Master, Master! Listen!
May the year ahead be a blessed one
I believe it shall be
Master, the Xiao Lanterns... I...
Ha!
Elementary
One shall fashion for you a Xiao Lantern the likes of which the world has never seen
Then, you must take it to Liyue Harbor, to display its magnificence for all
Listen! That must be Madame Ping!
