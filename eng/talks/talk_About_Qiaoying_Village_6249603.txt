Traveler: About Qiaoying Village...
Moyan: We're already within Qiaoying Village's borders. Welcome to the home of Liyue's most famous tea!
Moyan: Qiaoying Village is not as bustling as Yilong Wharf, but a quieter, more relaxed place has value all its own.
Moyan: If you like tea, please give our Sunglo Tea and Single-Origin Yauwan Tea a try. You'll love them!
