Traveler: The Naganohara Fireworks Show?
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: Oh, you mean my daughter? That girl can pick up anything very quickly. But she can be pretty reckless too. She's gotten herself in trouble a lot.
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: She was once invited by the Yashiro Commission to host a ceremony, but she accidentally started a very big fire. The fire brigade was very angry...
Naganohara Ryuunosuke: The fire brigade wanted to ban fireworks at the ceremony at that time. But how could we let that happen? The Fireworks Show is an essential part of life in Inazuma, after all. Banning fireworks would be like making Onigiri without rice or ramen without noodles.
