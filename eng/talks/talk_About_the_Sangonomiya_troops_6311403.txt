Traveler: About the Sangonomiya troops...
Kaida Ryouma: Compared to the elite troops of the Shogunate, we do appear to be the weaker side. But as an officer, I must have absolute confidence in our victory.
Kaida Ryouma: Also, we are backed by Her Excellency and General Gorou. The two of them are both brave and thoughtful leaders. They will lead us to victory.
