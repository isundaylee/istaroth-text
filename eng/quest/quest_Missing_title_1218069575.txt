## Talk 1

Bricole: Huh. Was the time limit too short? It seems even you found that rather tricky...
Bricole: Would you like to try again? You just need to *retrieve all the anchors inside the building within the time limit*, and then come find me.

## Talk 2

Bricole: Oh, you're back. Well, and so am I...
Bricole: After the Institute heard my brief report, I was asked to assess the area for suitability as a quality development training ground alongside conducting my retrieval work.
Bricole: *sigh* This all feels very familiar, somehow. I remember that there was a period of time when our Administrative Officer was very big on getting everyone to do diving training as well.
Bricole: I personally think that it's all rather pointless, but work is work, I suppose, and a mission is a mission... Not to mention how this place is rather strange... I mean, unique.
Bricole: As such, I've placed a few replica anchors in the area. Don't worry, they're just dummies. They're one-hundred-percent safe.
Bricole: The content of the current training is to *retrieve all the anchors inside the building within the time limit*.
Bricole: Would you like to give it a go? I can give you some compensation for taking part â€” you'll be assisting in research, after all.

## Talk 3

Bricole: Alright, I'm timing you. You need to *retrieve all the anchors inside the building within the time limit*, and then come find me.

## Talk 4

Traveler: Let me give it a try.
Bricole: Alright. I'll time you. Don't forget, you need to *retrieve all the anchors inside the building within the time limit*, and then come find me.

## Talk 5

Bricole: You got it! Looks like this challenge isn't impossible, after all! Guess I can submit this proposal to the Institute!
Bricole: Shame that I haven't finished checking all the assets yet, so I'll have to come back here later.
Bricole: But regardless, thanks for your help! Ah yes, and here's your reward. Safe travels, now!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: Alright, I'll give this another go.
Bricole: Alright then, I'll be timing you, as before.

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: Never mind the challenge first. What happened to Coutrot?
Bricole: Just being kicked out of the Fontaine Research Institute didn't bring him to his senses. He really is pigheaded.
Bricole: But nobody is backing him now, so you can relax. He can't cause any more trouble.

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: Anyway, who is Kuisel?
Bricole: I don't know either. I don't recall anyone by that name at the Fontaine Research Institute... Perhaps, as far as he's concerned, it's better that nobody by that name exists?
Bricole: Just like he said himself, Kuisel was just a convenient character. The more different that character was from himself, the better, as it made it less likely anyone would recognize him... Although that's just a guess of mine.
Bricole: *sigh* If you ask me, though, I think he changed enough over the years as it is. I didn't recognize him at first.

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: Leaving the challenge aside, what about the devices here...
Bricole: It's puzzling, isn't it? It seems like he's made... uh... various modifications to this place.
Bricole: Now it feels more suited to some ancient ruins that tourists might visit... Although perhaps it isn't too prudent to say it like that.
Bricole: *ahem* The aforementioned viewpoint is only my personal opinion, and is not representative of the Fontaine Research Institute or its viewpoints.

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: Forget it. You do your thing, alright?
Bricole: Leaving so soon? Okay...
Bricole: *sigh* This place starts to feel scary if you're alone here for too long...
