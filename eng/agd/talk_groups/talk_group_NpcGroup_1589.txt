Traveler: About your research?
Patchi the Curious: Why do I research ancient ruins? Out of curiosity, naturally! Surely you find the tantalizing traces of history inside irresistible too?
Patchi the Curious: Reading The Mondstadt Tower was what first got me interested in history.
Patchi the Curious: Everyone describes it as a historical romance, but... Personally, I didn't see what was so romantic about it when I read it.
Patchi the Curious: If you've never read it, you should take this copy. Seriously, it's a good read.

## Talk 1

Traveler: Are you running into some difficulties?
Patchi the Curious: Yes... In the interests of his safety, Mr. Doolan seems to think that there is no such thing as being what I would call overcautious.
Patchi the Curious: Sometimes the discovery to be made is so valuable that it merits taking on a certain amount of risk... but he sees that view as just an excuse for being rash and impulsive.
Patchi the Curious: Neither of us will be persuaded by the other, and he also keeps interrupting me... *sigh*

## Talk 2

Traveler: He seems like a bit of a shady character.
Patchi the Curious: Oh, I wouldn't go that far... Sure, he's not with the Adventurers' Guild, but he's an adventurer all the same.
Patchi the Curious: He has much more adventuring experience than me, and as a result he can discern the risks far better than I in many scenarios.
Patchi the Curious: I just think it's a bit difficult communicating with him; sometimes I barely understand what's coming out of his mouth... Maybe I'm just being too rigid and inflexible?

## Talk 3

Traveler: What's happened?
Patchi the Curious: I am a researcher of ancient ruins. I simply have to find a way to get inside and investigate... But how in the world is one supposed to get past a Ruin Guard?
Patchi the Curious: My acquaintance Doolan, an adventurer, was once injured by a Ruin Guard when he, too, sought to venture inside these ruins. We are discussing how to approach it.
Patchi the Curious: *sigh* But after hours and hours of discussion, we have made no progress whatsoever...
