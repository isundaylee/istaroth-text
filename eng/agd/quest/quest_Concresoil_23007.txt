# Concresoil


## Talk 1

Akim: Isn't there a better material...
Traveler: What material?
Akim: Sorry, I was talking to myself again. The fickle weather's been causing all sorts of problems with houses. I've never been this busy.
Traveler: Aren't you a potter?
Akim: Yeah, but I'm also a bricklayer. You see, it's all about the soil in either case. Not much of a difference.
Akim: Have you heard that saying? "Learning is like building a house. If you want to build a tall one, you must lay a solid foundation."
Akim: "And if you want to expand your knowledge, you need to ensure that your foundations are solid. A shifting foundation will only lead to collapse..."
Akim: Those smart higher-ups always say so. I don't really get it, but it's clear to me that they regard building houses to be as important as learning!
Traveler: They're just using a figure of speech...
Akim: Anyway, when you think of a house's foundations, you think of building materials.
Akim: Soil is the binding and support material, so if its stability and adaptability can be increased, our houses will be more durable. And I won't have to be this busy anymore.
Traveler: I don't think that's how you interpret it.

## Talk 2

Akim: I've come up with a few ideas, and today, I'm planning to find some soil soaked in Slime Condensate.
Akim: I've found out about a place where Slimes gather. Can you head there and find me some soil?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Akim: I'll leave it to you then. It doesn't matter if you take those Slimes down or not. Just bring some of the soil near them back.
Akim: I'll mark the place on the map for you...
Traveler: Not coming along?
Akim: I would love to, but I still have some pottery to handle.
Akim: Don't worry. I'll take care of the payment. Thanks a lot!
Akim: I'll mark the place on the map for you, so please head there and look for it.
Akim: I'll leave it to you then. It doesn't matter if you take those Slimes down or not. Just bring some of the soil near them back.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Ooh, there's lots of Slimes here. Paimon thinks the soil here will probably be what Akim wants.
Paimon: Let's go dig some soil out, shall we?

## Talk 4

Akim: I've come up with a few ideas, and I'm planning to find some moist soil today.
Akim: With adequate moisture and strong adhesion, it should be perfect for fixing cracks.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Akim: It would be great if you could help. I will mark the location on your map. Please go look for it...
Akim: Topsoil is not gonna work, so you'll have to dig deeper. I'm counting on you!
Traveler: Not coming along?
Akim: I would love to, but I still have some pottery to handle.
Akim: Don't worry. I'll take care of the payment. Thanks a lot!
Akim: I'll mark the place on the map for you, so please head there and look for it.
Akim: Ordinary topsoil is not gonna work, so you'll need to dig deeper.

## Talk 5

Akim: Have you found the soil that I need?

## Talk 6

Akim: That's exactly what I want. You're a great help!
Akim: This soil is sticky to the touch. Is this because there's some Slime Condensate mixed in it? I wonder if this can be mixed together with other soil types...
Akim: Anyway, thank you for your help, and please take your payment.
Akim: Oh, perhaps we should call it "Concresoil" or something...

### Additional Talk 1

Akim: This is exactly what I'm looking for. You're a great help! I'll start some experiments with this later.
Akim: Thank you so much. Please take this as your reward.
Akim: If I can mix different soils together, will the mixture be more durable...?

### Additional Talk 2

Akim: Yes, this is exactly what I want. You're a great help!
Akim: Hmm... It's softer than I expected. The adhesion is fine, but it doesn't provide enough support...
Akim: It's okay, though. As those wise folk put it, "No tall building was built in a day."
Akim: I suppose creating the kind of soil I want couldn't be that easy either...
Akim: Thank you so much. Please take this as your payment.
Akim: I'll try some other options later.
