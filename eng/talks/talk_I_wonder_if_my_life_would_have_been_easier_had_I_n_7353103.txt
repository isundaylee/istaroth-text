# Talk Dialog

Jami: I wonder if my life would have been easier had I not chosen this topic back then?
Jami: Maybe I'd have gone with something my seniors had studied before, and done a synthesis of some kind...
Jami: I'd have edited the data to get the result I wanted... Not like anyone would want to replicate such dull research anyway...
Jami: That's what they call "shooting first and drawing the target later," yes? Either way, I just wanted you to know that research is mostly a process of muddling along.
Traveler: That doesn't seem to apply to you.
Jami: *sigh* I fear I was just an idiot who didn't realize what was going on. Our mentor was quite strict with us, too, so I just ended up on this path.
Jami: But since I'm here, I might as well go all the way. Ah, I do hope the experiment goes well â€” it's either that, or I'm done for once my mentor gets out of bed next month!
