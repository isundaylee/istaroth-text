Master Lu: Really? Do you mean it?
Master Lu: I don't know... You seem to me to have itchy feet. Places you have to go, things you have to do.

Master Lu: When that time comes, I will devote myself fully to passing on everything I know. All the tricks of the trade of the Fanmu Carpenter's will be yours.
