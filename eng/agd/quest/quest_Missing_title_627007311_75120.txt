## Talk 1

Bitsin: You can jump from high places however you want, but the spot where you end up remains key...
Bitsin: That's why this Warrior's Challenge was set up. No matter how high up you are, you've got to watch your step... Would you like to give this a go, Outlander Warrior?
Traveler: Let's begin!
Traveler: Give me a moment to prep...

## Talk 2

Kinne: Hmm? Brave outlander, would you like to take part in this Warrior's Challenge? I've just adjusted the drop intervals on mine...
Kinne: As to what intervals I'm talking about... You'll find out once we start. What say you? Want to give it try?
Traveler: Let's begin!
Traveler: Give me a moment to prep...

## Talk 3

Pulmari: Oh my, a warrior from foreign lands! Could you do me a small favor here? As you can see, I'm in charge of a Warrior's Challenge, and I've got a participant quota to meet...
Pulmari: But I'm a few people short, so... Are you free at the moment?
Traveler: Let's begin!
Traveler: Give me a moment to prep...

## Talk 4

Bitsin: When leaping to greater heights, never forget to look down for a foothold. That's... the secret to jumping ever higher!

## Talk 5

Kinne: Make sure you grab all those Challenge Coins that come flowing in with the current. You'll score more points that way!

## Talk 6

Pulmari: Just follow the directions and keep pressing on. Simple as that!
