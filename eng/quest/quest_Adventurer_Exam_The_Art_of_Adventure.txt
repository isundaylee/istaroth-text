# Adventurer Exam: The Art of Adventure

Anna: Oh, so that's how it is...
Anna: Brother, do you know what these plants can do aside from being edible?
Anthony: How am I supposed to know that?
Anthony: I just know where you can find them and whether you can eat them or not.
Anna: Huh... Then I guess I should go check them out myself. Don't worry, I'm just going to gather some plants. I won't go anywhere near those monsters.
Anthony: ...Oh, just be careful, will you?
Anna: I know, I know. Well, I'll be a bit late back today, then.
Traveler: Still training, Anna?
Anna: Hey there, Traveler! Great timing â€” I was just planning to go out to observe some plants.
Anna: Cyrus told me that adventurers will often camp out in the wilds, where foraging is a very important skill.
Anna: As such, I'm planning to go investigate some wild plants, check out their features and characteristics, and then commit them to memory slowly.
Anna: That way, I'll at least know what I can and cannot eat out there in the future.
Anna: However, I don't think that pure writing is going to be very intuitive.
Anna: Traveler, I've heard that you have a gadget known as the Kamera. Is that true?
Anna: If so, could you help me snap some photos of a few plant species in their natural habitats?
Traveler: Sure.
Anna: Nice! In that case, could you get me photos of Calla Lilies, Small Lamp Grass, and Cecilias?
Anna: After that, please help me gather these three plant species. I'd like to keep them as samples.
Anna: Images of these plants in their natural habitats, live specimens, and detailed descriptions...
Anna: The botany section of my handbook looks to be in pretty good shape!
Anna: Alright then, Traveler, I'm counting on you.
Anna: The spring in Springvale plays host to large numbers of Calla Lilies, while Small Lamp Grass is common in Wolvendom.
Anna: As for Cecilias... it's got to be Starsnatch Cliff.
Anna: I'll continue my own plant observations elsewhere in the meantime.
Anna: Once you've got the pictures, let's meet up in the city.
Traveler: How's your training coming along?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Anna: You're back, Traveler! How have things gone? Did you manage to get those pictures?
Traveler: Pictures and samples, got them all right here.
Anna: Wow! That was super fast! I guess that's a seasoned adventurer for you, huh? You're amazing...
Anna: Thank you so much, Traveler! Actually, how about this? Let me make you a meal to show my thanks. I guarantee it'll be good!
Anna: Well, how does it look? Pretty good, huh? I hope you'll enjoy it!
Anna: As for me, I'll go write those notes up. Hmm, as for these plants...
Anna: I'll go ask Jack if he knows how to preserve plant specimens.
Anna: As for the Cecilias, I guess they'd look better in a vase somewhere instead of serving as specimens...

### Additional Talk 2

Anthony: *sigh* She's not really trying to become an adventurer, is she?
