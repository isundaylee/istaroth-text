# The Snowy Past


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hey, Timae— Huh, is that Albedo? Why is he leaving?
Traveler: (And why does he look so serious?)
Timaeus: Hey, it's the Traveler and Paimon!
Sucrose: Hello, you two! It's been a long time!
Paimon: Were you having a really serious discussion right now, or something?
Timaeus: Just a regular catch-up. We meet here once in a while to go through any recent developments in our research projects.
Paimon: Ugh, so we just missed him. Maybe we should have hollered to him...
Paimon: He didn't look in the best of moods just now, though. Was he upset about something? If so, he probably wouldn't have been in the mood to help out, anyway.
Sucrose: Huh... upset? You mean, Albedo?
Paimon: Yeah! He wasn't looking his usual self.
Sucrose: Upset... uh-oh, I wonder if...
Timaeus: Wh—What are you looking at me for?
Sucrose: I wonder if Timaeus's research topic is... so boring this time that Albedo finally snapped?
Timaeus: S—Surely not... It's not that boring! ...Is it?
Paimon: Hehe, nah! Anyway, Paimon wanted to ask you for a favor, Timaeus!
Timaeus: A favor? Haha, well sure! How can I help?
Paimon: Well, Paimon found a bunch of super-duper sweet Sunsettias in the mountains the other day. But if Paimon eats them all, then they'll be gone, so Paimon isn't ready to finish them all yet...
Paimon: Paimon was thinking maybe you could make a device that you put fruits in, and it turns them into juice! That way, they'll be preserved for as long as Paimon needs!
Traveler: ...
Timaeus: I'm afraid that sort of thing... is a little, uh...
Paimon: Huh? Seems pretty straightforward to Paimon... can't you do it?
Timaeus: Hahaha. Paimon, I'm afraid you've entered into the realm of the weird and wonderful with this one...
Paimon: Okay, so how about you, Sucrose? Any idea?
Sucrose: I'm sorry... it doesn't sound like it falls within my area of expertise. I could give it a try if you really want, but... I'd probably just end up giving all your precious fruits arms and legs.
Timaeus: Whoa... Your tone is so calm but your words are so terrifying. You'd think I'd be used to this by now...
Sucrose: Well, as you know, my focus is on Bio-Alchemy... Besides, keeping things fresh forever is just not possible. If you just wanted to modify certain properties of the fruit or their seeds, on the other hand, I'd easily be able to help with that.
Sucrose: Alchemists usually focus in on their own research areas. Take us for example — Timaeus, Albedo, and I all have very different research foci.
Sucrose: Paimon, your idea is very imaginative... but it's beyond Timaeus's and my ability.
Sucrose: I don't think even Albedo could make such an incredible device... After all, alchemy is not mechanics. There is a big difference between the two.
Traveler: Sorry, I just don't know what has gotten into Paimon today.
Paimon: Huh... Well, excuse Paimon for overestimating the power of alchemy...
Sucrose: In fact, before Albedo showed up, everyone in Mondstadt thought alchemy was useless.
Sucrose: Of course, we know better now. But even then, I have to admit that alchemy is only one of the many wondrous arts in the world. It's certainly not some kind of all-powerful magic that can simply take a substance and preserve it indefinitely... Ahem! Uh, sorry, that wasn't meant as a criticism against you personally...
Traveler: Don't blame yourself for Paimon's outlandishness.
Paimon: P—Paimon just wanted some fruit juice... What's wrong with that!?
Sucrose: Oh, of course, these are just Timaeus's and my subjective opinions on the matter. If you're really intent on pursuing this wondrous device... you can try your luck asking Albedo.
Sucrose: But I wouldn't get your hopes up. If he has no idea how to make one either, you'll have to give up on the idea.
Paimon: Hmm, he doesn't seem to be in a good mood today, though. What if he ignores us?
Timaeus: He won't. Albedo is not that kind of person.
Traveler: (But... there's something about Albedo today...)
Traveler: (Something seems different. What could it be?)
Paimon: Hey, so, where is Albedo heading to, anyway? Dragonspine?
Sucrose: Unless he specifically says otherwise, Dragonspine is where he usually goes. He seems particularly fond of that place. And somehow, the cold doesn't seem to bother him at all.
Paimon: Then let's go to Dragonspine to find him. C'mon, there's no time to lose!
Traveler: I will make sure to keep Paimon in check in the future.
Traveler: Do you realize how absurd you sound right now?
Traveler: (Did something happen?)

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hmm? This looks lively, what's the occasion? Let's go and have a look!
Amber: Hey, Traveler and Paimon! Fancy meeting you all the way out here.
Paimon: Amber, Cyrus, Pallad... What's everyone doing at Dragonspine? Don't you mind the cold?
Traveler: Hi all. Long time no see.
Cyrus: Oh? The Traveler is joining us too. Great, fantastic, wonderful! Hahahaha, the more the merrier.
Reckless Pallad: I agree. I feel much better with the Traveler joining us. Definitely the kind of person you want to have around in a tight spot.
Traveler: Sorry, what have I walked into here?
Paimon: Oh, right! Paimon remembers most of these people are from the Adventurers' Guild... Then again, it seems a certain Outrider has joined too.
Cyrus: Hahaha... allow me to explain.
Cyrus: The Adventurers' Guild is holding winter training on Dragonspine.
Cyrus: As you know, our members have varying levels of adventure experience. Dragonspine is an excellent place for budding adventurers to challenge themselves and improve... but it's dangerous to go alone.
Cyrus: So, we made a plan for senior members to pair up with junior members. This way, everyone can experience training on Dragonspine together under safe and controlled circumstances.
Cyrus: Now, every adventurer can progress together. I have been working on this grand plan for half a year now, and it's finally coming together! Hahaha, it's a great plan, isn't it!?
Cyrus: #Hey, {NICKNAME}, you are an outstanding adventurer. Surely you must be willing to join us and help out?
Traveler: Uh... Amber, what are you doing here?
Paimon: Is the Adventurers' Guild short on experienced members?
Amber: Well, that's part of it, actually...
Amber: The other reason is, when I was patrolling the perimeter of Dragonspine, I found a lost kid named Joel.
Amber: I heard he lives here on the camp, so I escorted him back.
Traveler: I remember that kid...
Amber: I know. Joel's father went missing.
Amber: I totally sympathize with how much Joel misses his family. Dragonspine is so bleak and deserted, it must have been so lonely for him here.
Paimon: Aw, Amber...
Amber: Anyway, I wanted to do something to cheer Joel up, so I said I'd build a snowman with him. It's something he enjoys doing.
Amber: It also gives me a chance to stay here for a while and help Cyrus out.
Traveler: Since it's for Joel, count me in.
Amber: Aw, really? Thank you!
Amber: Let's go meet up with Joel, then. Oh, I invited another friend of mine to join, too. She should be here any second. She'll be perfect for this kind of thing.
Amber: Hey, Cyrus, we've gotta take off. Is that okay?
Cyrus: No problem. Go ahead. I still have some final checks to make, so I will call you before we depart.
Traveler: Since it's you, Amber, count me in.
Traveler: But... Joel's father...
Traveler: What's the occasion?

## Talk 3

Amber: Hey, Joel, we're here.
Traveler: Hi, Joel!
Joel: Hi, everyone. Haha, I'm so happy right now! It's nice to have so many people to hang out with.
Joel: Are you here to build a snowman, too?
Eula: Build... a snowman?
Amber: Oh, sorry. I forgot to do the introductions.
Amber: This is Eula, the Spindrift Knight and Captain of the Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Company...
Eula: Amber, you're being far too formal. The child is never going to remember all that.
Eula: Please, just call me Eula.
Joel: Okay, Aunty Eula! You can call me Joel.
Eula: Aunty... Eula...
Paimon: Uh oh, Eula's gonna add that to her long list of scores to settle...
Eula: ...Alright, if that's what you want to call me, go right ahead.
Paimon: Whoa, Eula just let something go for once!
Eula: Amber, what's this I hear about a snowman? I came to assist because you told me the Adventurers' Guild was short-handed.
Amber: Yeah, that's something else. But look, Joel's at that age where he should be having fun, and there's nothing to play with on Dragonspine.
Amber: He used to build snowmen with his dad, and since his dad's not around, we're keeping him company instead.
Amber: Besides, Eula, it's gotta be more fun than taking an ice bath all by yourself.
Amber: Let's combine our forces and build ourselves a huge snowman! It'll be a ton of fun.
Traveler: I approve.
Paimon: Yup yup, count Paimon in, too! Paimon wants to build a snowman.
Eula: ...
Joel: Aunty Eula, are you too busy to join in?
Joel: If so, it's okay, I understand...
Eula: No, nothing like that. My mind was on something else, that's all. Building a snowman with Joel, are we? Sounds wonderful. I'd be delighted to join you.
Traveler: Eula?
Amber: Then let's get started! First, we need to split up into teams to gather some supplies!
Amber: #Joel and I will be on one team. {NICKNAME}, you and Eula can be on the other team.
Amber: Hey Joel, see that huge tree over there? Wanna race me there?
Joel: Yeah! Let's do it!
Paimon: Wow, those two are fast.
Paimon: It's hard to tell which of them is having more fun.
Paimon: Hey, what's up with you two? Why are you just staring at each other without saying anything?
Traveler: You're acting a little out of character...
Eula: Umm... ahem, ahem...
Traveler: We are alone here. Just tell me.
Eula: Joel probably hasn't spent much of his life in the city.
Eula: He doesn't know me... and he doesn't know what the Lawrence name means to people in Mondstadt.
Paimon: Right, that's why he calls you Aunty Eula.
Traveler: Careful, Paimon.
Eula: ...True. In his eyes, I'm just another ordinary person from Mondstadt.
Eula: It was a surprise, but not in a bad way at all.
Traveler: Then it's time to get building a snowman!
Eula: Indeed. It's just...
Eula: *sigh* That's the thing. I'm a little worried that I won't be up to the challenge.
Eula: I have never built a snowman before. My upbringing was very strict, so I never had the chance when I was a child.
Eula: And after I grew up, of course, it's not the sort of thing I would spend my time doing.
Paimon: Oh no, Paimon's starting to feel sorry for Eula.
Traveler: Take it easy. It's just for fun.
Eula: ...You sound confident. Alright then.
Eula: Enough small talk for now. I see we have a member of the Adventurers' Guild joining us.
Cyrus: Greetings. We have a slight problem here. We've done a headcount and it turns out that we have an odd number of participants. In other words, we still have one instructor slot left to fill.
Cyrus: How it happened was, we originally asked Fischl to be an instructor, but she was busy with something outside of Mondstadt during this period. So we found another adventurer to fill in for her, but they still haven't shown up yet...
Cyrus: Thank goodness you are here. *sigh*
Gerald: Oh, hello. My name is Gerald, I'm a new adventurer...
Eula: In that case...
Traveler: Eula can help.
Eula: ...
Eula: Fine. But for that, you will pay.
Gerald: Huh? P—Pay for what? ...
Traveler: That's just how Eula talks...
Gerald: Okay, I—I got it. I'm ready and willing to learn!
Cyrus: Good, good. Then everything is settled. Thank you for your help, Eula.
Cyrus: #{NICKNAME}, if anybody else signs up later, I may have to ask for your help as well.
Traveler: No problem.
Paimon: Why did you give the spot to Eula?
Traveler: I want people to know all the good qualities she has.
Paimon: Ohh, okay. Hehe, you're so nice. Paimon noticed Eula smiled just now, it must have meant a lot to her.
Paimon: To be honest, Eula really is the best candidate for an instructor. Most people would find it hard to cope on the mountain 'cause of the sheer cold, but not her.
Paimon: Oh! Now Paimon gets it, this must be the whole reason why Amber got Eula involved in the first place!
Paimon: We were supposed to find supplies, but now Eula's busy with other stuff and Paimon doesn't feel like going around collecting things... How do you think Amber and Joel are doing? Let's head up the mountain and see what they're up to!
Traveler: Eula desperately needs this kind of opportunity.
Traveler: You're in safe hands with Eula...
Traveler: Don't worry about it. The Honorary Knight will help you.
Traveler: So there's something else bothering you?
Eula: Hm. How very perceptive of you.
Eula: Were you staring at me the whole time when everyone was talking? You shan't be getting off lightly for that.
Eula: The truth is, I'm a little concerned that I might be quite inept at building snowmen.
Traveler: There's no one else around. You can say.
Traveler: I'm trying to figure out what you're thinking...
Traveler: It's been a long time, Joel.

## Talk 4

Paimon: The sound has completely stopped...
Traveler: It looks like we lost it.
Paimon: How could that happen? After all the adventures we've been on, our tracking skills are honed to perfection, aren't they?
Paimon: Guess we underestimated whatever was behind it, but if that's the case... then what exactly are we dealing with here?
Albedo: I know that voice...
Paimon: Hmm? Huh?
Albedo: What brings you to Dragonspine?
Traveler: So it was just you.
Paimon: Ohh! So it was Albedo all along!
Albedo: "All along"...? What do you mean by that?
Paimon: On the way here, we kept hearing weird noises and it felt like someone was watching us the whole time... Turns out it was just you.
Paimon: Honestly, you really gave us the creeps! If you're bored up here, go find something useful to do — don't go sneaking around and scaring the poop out of people!
Albedo: The things you felt and heard could easily be attributed to animals, or bandits perhaps. You should be wary at all times in this environment — there are all too many ways to sustain losses here if you aren't careful.
Albedo: So. What business brought you here?
Traveler: It's a long story...
Paimon: We actually came to look for you, but then it turned into looking for Amber, but now we've met you, so we're back to that again...
Albedo: Hmm. Your thought process is rather chaotic, as is the way in which you articulate it.
Paimon: Hey! How dare you! All Paimon's trying to say is that we came here to look for you!
Albedo: Oh? Is that so?
Albedo: Then it must surely be something of great importance. I'm all ears.
Traveler: Actually... it's nothing serious...
Paimon: He seems to be in a better mood than we thought, right? Does that mean Timaeus' stupidity doesn't really get to him after all?
Traveler: We were probably overthinking it.
Paimon: Huh... Okay, let's... let's just forget that ever came up!
Albedo: It's okay if you can't tell me about it. Just treat this as an opportunity to stroll on the mountain and enjoy the view.
Paimon: Hehehe. So basically, the truth is we're here on adventurer duty.
Traveler: You tell Albedo about the event that the Adventurers' Guild is holding...
Albedo: I see. So, you foisted the rookie off onto Eula, so that you could wander off and goof around?
Paimon: We're not goofing around! And Eula was the right person for the job — we were just being nice.
Paimon: What about you, then, huh? What're you doing on Dragonspine?
Albedo: A friend commissioned me to do some artwork recently, and I have yet to finish. I came here because it's a quiet place where I can gather my thoughts, gather inspiration — and gather some raw materials while I'm at it.
Paimon: Raw materials for what?
Albedo: Paint.
Albedo: Starsilver can be used to make high-quality silver paint. I just ran out of my previous batch, so I'll collect some ore while I'm here.
Paimon: Ore can be used to make paint?
Albedo: Yes. But you have to be selective with the specimens you choose.
Albedo: Even with a high level of impurities, Starsilver still contains fine silver-colored particles. But they lack luster, which impacts the color saturation of the pigment made from them. Paint made with such pigment is generally viewed as a fake or a defective product.
Paimon: Interesting! So paint aside, can you talk about how you find inspiration? Paimon wants to learn!
Albedo: You want to learn to paint?
Paimon: #No, no, not for me, for the Traveler. Paimon wants {NICKNAME} to learn how to paint!
Paimon: During our travels, we sometimes have nights where there's nothing to do. It'd sure be nice to do something memorable rather than just sit around...
Paimon: Painting is a great example, because it can capture a moment in time. So it seems like it's definitely a worthwhile skill to have.
Traveler: So... you want me to learn to paint now?
Paimon: Yep! Why not? Once you've mastered it, you can paint Paimon!
Albedo: Not a bad idea. Well, since you two would like to learn more about painting, why don't you come with me to the campsite? I have painting materials there. You can practice while I give you some guidance.
Paimon: Sounds great!
Traveler: What about Amber...?
Paimon: Oh, she'll be fiiiine! She is a knight of Favonius after all. Let's just forget about all that stuff for now and go with Albedo.
Traveler: Alright, fine...
Paimon: C'mon, let's go! It's so cold out — Paimon wants to get to the camp and warm up by the fire!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Strange. Didn't they say they were going this way? Where the heck are they?
Paimon: Did we get here too late? Have they moved on already?
Traveler: Did you hear that...
Paimon: Uh... C—Could they be in danger!?
Paimon: Hurry! Let's go check it out!
Traveler: I just heard a strange noise coming from up the mountain...

## Talk 6

Paimon: Aaaah!
Traveler: What's going on...?
Paimon: Thieves! It's gotta be!
Albedo: ...
Albedo: Some things are missing.
Paimon: Nothing valuable, hopefully? Wait, where's Paimon's Mora?
Albedo: It's hard to say their value, but...
Albedo: Some of my alchemy notes are missing.
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Alchemy notes? Would they fetch a high price?
Albedo: To the uninitiated, they are merely scraps of paper. But for someone who knows what they're doing... the knowledge contained in those notes is more valuable than any treasure.
Paimon: So you're saying only someone who knows alchemy would've stolen them? But the only people who come to Dragonspine are adventurers, thieves, and monsters... What use would any of them have with your notes?
Traveler: I don't think it's that simple.
Albedo: I feel the same way. However, hilichurl break-ins and other such incidents are not unheard-of on Dragonspine. It's difficult to draw a conclusion based solely on the evidence at hand.
Albedo: ...
Albedo: Hmm? These appear to be...
Paimon: Footprints?
Albedo: Fresh ones. Meaning, our thief can't have made it far.
Paimon: Let's chase them down. We can't let 'em get away!

## Talk 7

Cyrus: It feels like every time I try to drum up some enthusiasm for my idea, nobody wants to know. But whenever the young lass starts talking, everyone rallies behind her! ...What am I doing wrong?
Reckless Pallad: Hey, don't talk that way, Cyrus! You're the branch master! You're awesome!
Cyrus: ...
Cyrus: Have you done anything apart from resting all day? Come on, are your supplies ready? Have you done your warm-up exercises? If not, then get to it, lad!
Reckless Pallad: Oh, uh, yeah! Sure!

## Talk 8

Timaeus: Seriously!? Albedo doesn't like my alchemy device? It can create tiny ice crystals! I thought I had a good design here — I was planning to take it further...
Sucrose: Timaeus... it's not completely useless, but... perhaps it needs to be a little more original...
Timaeus: O—Okay... I see. I'll give it some more thought... Hmm, then again, what IS the use of this thing? I'm the one who came up with it, and even I can't think of a potential application...
