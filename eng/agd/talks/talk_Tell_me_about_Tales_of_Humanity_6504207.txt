Traveler: Tell me about "Tales of Humanity"...
Euphrasie: One of the primary reasons we had for establishing our newspaper was to ensure that information flows and that everyone can understand what's happening around them.
Euphrasie: Slowly, we moved to not only attempting to let readers "know," but to also let them "express" themselves.
Euphrasie: Thus, "Tales of Humanity" was born. Everyone can write in to this column, and similarly, everyone can read it.
Euphrasie: As for the result... Well, you've seen it, haven't you? Our prints are practically drowning in all manner of content.
Euphrasie: But that's not a bad thing. In my experience, listeners also need some light reading to go with their explosive news.
Euphrasie: Additionally, being able to help our readers does our reputation good.
Euphrasie: In other words, we'll be troubling you somewhat further. Fret not â€” you will find our payment quite suitable.
