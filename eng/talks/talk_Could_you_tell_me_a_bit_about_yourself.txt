Traveler: Could you tell me a bit about yourself?
Takami: I work for the Yashiro Commission and am in charge of the festivals and Fireworks Show. You can entrust me with any work that is related to event organizing, venue management, or festival- and Fireworks Show-related.
Takami: A traveler like yourself really must come and experience Inazuma's seasonal festivals and renowned Naganohara Fireworks Show.
Takami: Though short-lived, their radiant flares and meteoric glitters are a sight to remember for sure.
