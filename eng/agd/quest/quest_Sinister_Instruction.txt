# Sinister Instruction


## Talk 1

Washizu: ...?
Traveler: Hello?
Washizu: ...
Traveler: Are you listening to me?
Washizu: ...
Traveler: Hello?
Washizu: ...Please do not disturb me anymore.
Washizu: "He" is unhappy. "He" is displeased with the disturbance caused by "words of the tongue," which drown out the wisdom of the "words of the heart."
Traveler: "Words of the tongue"...?
Washizu: The "words of the tongue" are like pouring rain. They shake the eardrums and disrupt the heart.
Washizu: The "words of the heart" are like fog. They seep in naturally, enshrouding...
Washizu: Shh...! "He" is listening. "He" is speaking.
Washizu: Do not use your tongue. Do not use your ears. Listen with your heart...
Washizu: Come here. Worship. Pray. And listen.
Washizu: Remember, worship three times. Three times.
Traveler: (Give it a try.)
Traveler: I think I'll pass...
Traveler: Nod your head if you can speak.
Traveler: What are you doing?

## Talk 2

Washizu: "He" is coming! Don't stop worshiping! We must not stop worshiping!
Traveler: Are you alright...?
Washizu: "He" is sullen. "His" anger shall soon burst forth!
Traveler: What?
Washizu: And why? Why, because of that woman! The one who refuses to pay tribute! The evil one!
Traveler: A woman...?
Washizu: She flees even now, but how can she escape him? Eighteen pairs of blood-red eyes! Thousands of sharp, venomous fangs! Countless mouths and numberless tongues, ever thirsting after blood!
Washizu: She can't hide, she can't hide!
Washizu: Ah, the desert nation of arid sentiment! And you, the foolish beggar who hides in the forest, claiming to be wise — none of you can protect her!
Traveler: Please calm down!
Washizu: You have the blessing! Go and worship! Go and worship!
Traveler: Oh yes, well said, good sir!
Traveler: Oh yes, darn her, am I right?
Traveler: Oh yes, it shall soon burst forth!
Traveler: Oh, "he" is coming!

## Talk 3

Washizu: Hear me, please don't leave me...

## Talk 4

Washizu: Worship. Pray. Listen... Remember, remember.

## Talk 5

Outsider Shrine: (It looks like an ordinary shrine — there is a distinct lack of any strange elemental traces.)
Traveler: Pay respects at the shrine
Outsider Shrine: (The moist sea breeze brushes against your cheek, and a sea bird sings in the distance as it merges into the lonely clouds. You try to listen, but nothing happens.)

Traveler: Pay respects at the shrine
Outsider Shrine: (Washizu struggles to calm his restless mind, breathing heavily. He is obviously in a state of passion and seems to be expecting something. You try to listen, but nothing happens.)

## Talk 8

Traveler: Continue to pay respects
Outsider Shrine: (Washizu is not completely insane. He obviously desires something, but what is this desire? Thinking only invites more questions. You try to listen, but nothing happens.)

## Talk 10

Washizu: How is it? Were you fortunate enough to hear "his" teachings?
Traveler: I heard nothing.
Washizu: Ah, it is alright. It is alright. "He" sees. "He" hears.
Washizu: "He" is comforted, and those who delight in "him" shall be rewarded.
Washizu: "His" reward is not on yonder shore. It is tomorrow.
Traveler: Do you know what you're talking about?
Washizu: Next time you're here, you can see for yourself.
Traveler: Excuse my shallowness, but I do not understand you.
Traveler: I have not had the fortune to hear anything.

## Talk 11

Washizu: Compared with "his" great blessings, this is but a small reward.
Washizu: Pray. Worship. Listen to "him," and let "him" listen to you!
Washizu: Then, like me, you will hear "his" words coming from your heart.
Washizu: Then "he" will lead you out of suffering and grant you a great reward.
Traveler: Well...
Washizu: Remember. Worship three times a day and you will be rewarded.
Washizu: Remember, remember.
Traveler: Whatever you say.

## Talk 12

Traveler: Continue to pay respects
Outsider Shrine: (You hear the sound of the waves crashing against the rocks, and that cascading sound leads people to gaze out at the place where sea and sky meet. You try to listen, but nothing happens.)

## Talk 13

Washizu: "He" must be calmed. "His" anger must be soothed...
Washizu: You've done well! You've done very well!
Washizu: Remember, some will try to cheat you with masks, but "he" will help you. "He" will always help you.
Traveler: Hmm...
Washizu: That woman is like the kitsune demons of legend. I let her go. "He" is very angry.
Washizu: "He" is angry again... This is my sin.
Washizu: Please forgive me... I will sacrifice again. I will find a sacrifice for the "returning"...
Washizu: Please forgive me, please forgive me...
Washizu: Please forgive me, please forgive me...
Traveler: Sure, I guess...?

## Talk 14

Outsider Shrine: (It looks like an ordinary shrine — there is a distinct lack of any strange elemental traces.)
Traveler: Pay respects at the shrine
Outsider Shrine: (The fragrance of unnamed wildflowers drifts in from nearby. It seems that there is a fox hiding in the bushes, making a rustling sound. You try to listen, but nothing happens.)

Traveler: Continue to pay respects
Outsider Shrine: (Yashiori Island has withered away due to the war, and it is a sad sight. But here, the empty tranquility lends vitality to nature. You try to listen, but nothing happens.)

## Talk 16

Washizu: You are here.
Traveler: How are you doing?
Washizu: Thank you for forgiving my sins. Please let me return to you...
Traveler: Are you talking to me?
Washizu: What... But why...
Washizu: I presided over every sacrifice, and I accepted every one of your blessings!
Washizu: But she, branded by you, established by your hand, has fled from your blessings. She has betrayed us!
Traveler: What are you talking about...
Washizu: Ah! Uh, sorry... Sorry...
Washizu: I should not doubt "his" choice. Continue to endure, continue to worship...
Traveler: Can you hear me?
Washizu: Continue to endure... Continue to worship...
Washizu: Continue to endure... Continue to worship...

## Talk 17

Outsider Shrine: (This looks like a common shrine with no special features. Seeing Washizu in this state, do you still want to keep paying respects at this shrine?)
Traveler: Pay respects at the shrine
Outsider Shrine: (Washizu is still muttering to himself by the side, and he doesn't look well at all. The shrine is still and unresponsive. Perhaps this is all a scam? You try to listen, but nothing happens.)

## Talk 18

Outsider Shrine: (This looks like a common shrine with no special features. Seeing Washizu in this state, do you still want to keep paying respects at this shrine?)
Traveler: Continue to pay respects
Outsider Shrine: (You hear the wind whistling through the great serpent's bones, but the ancient corpse remains still. It seems to have been weathered by the sea into an instrument — the most mournful instrument in the ocean. You try to listen, but nothing happens.)

## Talk 19

Outsider Shrine: (It looks like an ordinary shrine — there is a distinct lack of any strange elemental traces.)
Traveler: Continue to pay respects
Outsider Shrine: (You can hear lizards running, and you can see the tiny, bamboo leaf-like footprints they leave, elegant yet transient. You try to listen, but nothing happens.)

## Talk 20

Washizu: Worship, listen...
Washizu: "He" is strong because "he" listens. "He" sees and hears everything because "he" is strong. Thus "he" sees all there is. Hears all there is.
Washizu: Neither the fools in Sangonomiya nor the madmen of Narukami Island understand it, feel it. So all they know is to fight each other and let the blood blind their eyes...
Washizu: But you must understand that.
Traveler: This logic's a mess...
Washizu: The answer lies in worship.
Washizu: Remember. Worship three times a day and you shall be rewarded.
Traveler: I get it, more or less.
