Traveler: About that device...
Lemarcq: You mean the Pneumousia Ray Self-Defense Device?
Lemarcq: Well, when I offered to return it to Miss Fusilier, she immediately wanted to chuck it into the sea.
Lemarcq: It took some persuading, but she reluctantly agreed to let me use it for the time being. Though she also reiterated that she never wanted to lay eyes on it ever again.
Lemarcq: ...In any case, I'm very grateful for Miss Fusilier's kindness.
