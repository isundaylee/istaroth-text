# Crash Course on Inazuman Fashion


## Talk 1

Ogura Mio: This is no way to continue doing business...
Traveler: Is something the matter?
Ogura Mio: Ah, I'm sorry. I was just a little lost in my own thoughts. Are you here to buy some clothes?
Ogura Mio: The high-class silks from Liyue remain out of stock, but we still have the latest kimonos.
Traveler: You used to import material from Liyue?
Ogura Mio: Yes. Before, we were often able to secure high-end silk from Liyue such as those that the Feiyun Commerce Guild makes from Silk Flowers.
Ogura Mio: But with the current situation here, we haven't been able to import that sort of silk in a while now. We've been having to rely on our existing stock to continue operations.
Ogura Mio: Every bolt of silk we use here is one we're not getting back...
Ogura Mio: I originally planned to design some novel kimono patterns myself, or use some new dyes to make new cloth and attract customers.
Ogura Mio: But I've been unable to come up with anything that might be considered "new" dyes...
Ogura Mio: Considering your many journeys, Traveler, I'm sure you've seen a great deal. Have you encountered any dye-work that you might consider "novel"?
Traveler: Oh, I've seen some alright.
Ogura Mio: I—Is that so?
Ogura Mio: If you could, please help me broaden my horizons. Find me some base materials from which I can might new types of dye.
Ogura Mio: I will take care of the payment. Again, thank you so much!
Traveler: Do you only need dyes?
Ogura Mio: In these circumstances, I think that's the only thing I can do at the moment...
Ogura Mio: If you know of any such base material that can be used to make "new" dyes, please bring them to me. I'll arrange for the necessary payment.

Traveler: You used to import material from Liyue?
Ogura Mio: Yes. Before, we were often able to secure high-end silk from Liyue such as those that the Feiyun Commerce Guild makes from Silk Flowers.
Ogura Mio: But at the moment, we have yet to reestablish connections with our suppliers, so we can only work with the stock we still have.
Ogura Mio: As such, every bolt of silk we use here is one we're not getting back...
Ogura Mio: I originally planned to design some novel kimono patterns myself, or use some new dyes to make new cloth and attract customers.

## Talk 3

Ogura Mio: Have you found any suitable base materials?

## Talk 4

Ogura Mio: Ah, so that's what you've brought. Yes, yes, I do think that these colors will be quite the novelty indeed.
Ogura Mio: Thanks so much for getting me these, Traveler. I'll give them a try in a moment — please take this as compensation for your efforts.
Ogura Mio: I wonder what colors we'll be able to get...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Ogura Mio: Th—these... Are you sure that these can be used in dyes? I can't say I've ever heard of them...
Ogura Mio: O—Oh well, I suppose I'll just give it a go. Here, Traveler, take these as a token of my appreciation...
