Chesil: Welcome, welcome. Our store offers the most extensive selection of precious gems in the entire Court of Fontaine. We also have the newest ornaments and craft goods for sale.
Chesil: Anything here catch your eye?

## Talk

Traveler: About the latest ornaments on sale...
Chesil: That's got to be the Wings of Oscillation.
Chesil: They are modeled after the slim wings of Crystalflies. The metallurgical process used to make them is quite unique, and they are encrusted with dazzling gems...
Chesil: They say that even the gentlest breeze will cause them to flap like real Crystalfly wings. To say that the Wings of Oscillation have taken high-class society by storm would be an understatement!
Chesil: But though everyone loves chasing fads, I'd say that ornaments should be chosen according to their ability to bring out our unique characters.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Chesil: We often push out new products, so your patronage is always welcome!

## Talk

Chesil: Welcome! We meet again.
Chesil: Are you here to see the latest ornaments this time?
Chesil: Or did you bring some special ore with you once again?

## Talk

Traveler: About the ore we brought previously...
Chesil: We're still at work on that front. I'm afraid the final product is some ways away...
Chesil: I'm afraid you'll have to wait till next time...

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about clock production...
Chesil: Thanks to you, the mass production of the new clock model has been going smoothly, and the ores Ms. Puca has provided to us have been of high quality.
Chesil: Actually, I was planning to make a new batch of clocks designed for Melusines based on this model.
Chesil: Of course, we'll use a water-resistant clam-style structure — I'm sure this will be a market-opener!
Chesil: The only problem we have is that Ms. Puca doesn't seem to want to use Mora as collateral for trade...
Chesil: I've been racking my brains as to the sort of things she'll take in exchange...
