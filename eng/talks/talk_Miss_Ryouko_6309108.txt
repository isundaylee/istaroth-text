Traveler: Miss Ryouko?
Yegor: Yeah. Miss Ryouko is a lady who runs a food stall there. Have you ever tried her snacks?
Yegor: She knew that I wouldn't be used to the food here, so she changed the taste up for me... That's so sweet of her!
Yegor: I've heard that her husband passed away several years ago, leaving her to take care of the stall alone...
Yegor: Hmm... I suppose I should go visit her stall more often.
