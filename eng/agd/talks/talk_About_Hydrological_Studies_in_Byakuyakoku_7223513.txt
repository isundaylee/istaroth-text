Traveler: About "Hydrological Studies in Byakuyakoku"...
Ema: Ugh, that idiot Date!
Ema: This book was borrowed by the young master of a distinguished clan from Byakuyakoku. It's been quite a few years since then. His Narukami-style name is Date, son of Eurydates.
Ema: He said that he wanted to build a new generation of anti-Bathysmal Vishap defense works... but I bet he just wanted to have fun building some maze.
Ema: Ah, rich people and their kids. You just have to envy them.
