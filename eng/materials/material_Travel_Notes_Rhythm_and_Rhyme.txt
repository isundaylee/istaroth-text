# Travel Notes: Rhythm and Rhyme

Namecard style.
With magnificent sunglow sheds light on the night sky, chimes are orchestrated to celebrate the bygone year. The gilded palaces are adorned with beaded curtains, the railings painted silver by bright moonlight, and the feasts brimmed with jolly singing and dances. Is that flowers or fireworks? A wealth of instruments plays in unison, harmonious and pleasant.
