Traveler: How do you like it here?
Shikanoin Heizou: Hehe, thanks for looking out for me.
Shikanoin Heizou: But no need to worry, I'd say the peace and quiet you have here makes it an even better vacation spot than Watatsumi Island.
Shikanoin Heizou: Too bad there are no cases to crack, though... It's almost too serene. Lacks a little intrigue.
Traveler: I'm sorry about that...
Shikanoin Heizou: Oh â€” no no, that's my problem. Gah, look at me, making you feel bad...
Shikanoin Heizou: ...Hey, I have an idea! I think it'll give me a chance to redeem myself and serve as something fun to do.
Shikanoin Heizou: Let's play a little game of mine!
Shikanoin Heizou: Here's how it works: After you return here each day, I'll try to guess what you did that day, what you ate... even who you saw.
Shikanoin Heizou: If I win, you'll think of something to do for me. But, if I lose, then I'll treat you to the best Kushikatsu place I know. How's that sound?
Traveler: Is there anything I can do for you?
Shikanoin Heizou: Oh? Well, I guess there is one thing.
