# Etienne's Raw Meat Request


## Talk 1

Traveler: About Raw Meat...
Etienne: Phew... My savior! You're finally here.
Etienne: You've brought all the raw meat, right? Hand them over. I'll get Baguette's dish done and go to rest.
Traveler: Raw Meat is ready.
Traveler: Not yet.
Etienne: Then could I trouble you to hurry up a little? I'm really tired, and just want to go get some rest.
