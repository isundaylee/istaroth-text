Klee: Kaeya once told me that if I spend too much time playing in one day without resting, I'll be too tired to play the next day, and I'll miss out on all the fun.
Klee: So I decided: When the sun gets up, I'll get up, and when the sun goes to bed, I'll go to bed. That way, I'll always be full of energy!
Klee: #You should do what Kaeya says too, Mr. Honorary Knight!

Klee: How big do the monsters here get? Maybe... even bigger than the highest tree in the Whispering Woods?
Klee: Anyway, there's no need to worry! I've made an even bigger bomb!
Klee: #Da-da-da~ Klee to the rescue, clearing the way for Mr. Honorary Knight!

## Talk

Klee: #Mr. Honorary Knight! Guess what I found? Loads of stories that Mommy used to read to me!
Klee: Whenever I shouted out, "Nooo, we can't let that happen!" Mommy would give me a pen and paper and let me finish the rest of the story myself.
Klee: By climbing through the window, or popping out from a nearby bush, or coming down from a tree... I always found a way to bring Dodoco into the story!
