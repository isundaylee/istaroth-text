# The Crux Clash


## Talk 1

Zhuhan: You seem like you're raring to go. Are you ready to compete?
Traveler: Yes, I'm ready.
Zhuhan: Good, then please follow me into the arena.
Traveler: Not quite.
Zhuhan: Not a problem, there's still time. Make sure you're fully prepared!

## Talk 2

Zhuhan: You seem like you're raring to go. Are you ready to compete?
Traveler: Yes, I'm ready.
Zhuhan: Good, then please follow me into the arena.
Traveler: Not quite.
Zhuhan: Not a problem, there's still time. Make sure you're fully prepared!

## Talk 3

Beidou: At last, the moment we've all been waiting for — the semi-finals have begun!
Beidou: Who's it going to be this time — the hero, or the dark horse?
Rongshi: I don't care about the prize...
Rongshi: You're a strong opponent. That's what I'm here for.

## Talk 4

Zhuhan: Your opponent in the semi-finals is new to The Crux Clash, but he has quickly become the dark horse of the tournament.
Zhuhan: I do not doubt your abilities, but I would suggest that you make sure you are fully prepared before you begin.
Paimon: #Relax! My {F#girl}{M#guy}'s at the top of {F#her}{M#his} game, {F#she}{M#he} ain't gonna lose!
Traveler: I'm ready.
Zhuhan: Okay. Follow me.
Traveler: Interesting... getting a few butterflies over here.
Zhuhan: Don't worry, take some time to compose yourself.

## Talk 5

Rongshi: I'm sweating all over. It's a good feeling.
Rongshi: Congratulations, I was beaten by the best. I need to train harder.
Traveler: You fought very well yourself.
Paimon: Right! For a moment there, Paimon was a little worried...
Paimon: If you had a Vision, you'd definitely be one of the strongest around.
Rongshi: I wanted a Vision, once, when I was a kid. People said that if you're strong enough you'll have your chance to get one.
Rongshi: But mine never came.
Rongshi: I lost interest, eventually. You can't depend on a Vision like you can your own body.
Rongshi: I've fought and won against Vision bearers before. The power they have was given to them by the gods. I don't envy it.
Paimon: Huh? You mean, you didn't sign up to try and get your hands on that Masterless Vision?
Rongshi: No, I didn't. I only wanted to pit myself against other fighters and see who was the strongest.
Rongshi: Only in defeat can you understand your weaknesses and learn from them. So, I'm pleased with today's outcome. I don't often have the pleasure of experiencing defeat.
Paimon: Wow... now that's true strength talking!
Rongshi: If you have the chance in the future, please come and spar with me again. I will be stronger next time.
Traveler: So will I.
Paimon: By the way... do you know who else made it into the finals? ...Is it gonna be someone even tougher than you?
Rongshi: Whether they'll be as tough as me I don't know... But what I have heard is that they're extremely quick.
Rongshi: So don't get too cocky.
Traveler: I believe you have the potential to be champion.

## Talk 6

Uncle Yun: Ah, it's you, haha! I watched your match. What a stunning performance!
Uncle Yun: I myself was eliminated in the third round. *sigh* Shame... If only I could have advanced one more round...
Paimon: Ah, maybe next time, huh? By the way, do you happen to know who else advanced to the final round?
Uncle Yun: Why, yes. He's the same one who defeated me. He is a formidable opponent, quick on his feet and swift to take advantage of his opponent's missteps.
Uncle Yun: I faltered for but a brief moment, but before I knew it, he had me on the floor.
Uncle Yun: Given my stature, I have no fear of squaring off with physically strong opponents. But faced with a nimble, agile opponent such as him... I found myself completely out of my league...
Uncle Yun: Still — I'm sure he'll be no match for you, haha!

## Talk 7

Paimon: Hey there... uh, but where did the other guy go?
Liang: He tried to use force dispersal to deflect a punch, but instead he took it straight to the nose. There was blood all over the place...
Liang: His opponent was pretty freaked out by it. He kept asking him "why didn't you dodge?" But he was pretty much out cold by that point and couldn't reply.
Liang: "Why don't you dodge?" they ask... Because to not dodge is the very essence of Lingshan Clan kung fu. It's just that he hadn't quite mastered it yet.
Traveler: How did your match go?
Liang: Don't even get me started... I spent all my energy helping him get from here to the boat to take him back to the harbor. But by the time I got back, my scheduled match time had already passed, and I had to forfeit.
Liang: I don't dare tell my master about this... Otherwise, I'd never hear the end of it.
Liang: Sorry, I shouldn't be complaining in front of you like this. I'm afraid I'm still a bit out of sorts at the moment, so I probably won't be able to help you with whatever you were here to ask me about.
Paimon: Oh, alright then... hope your buddy makes a swift recovery. Hang in there!
Liang: Thanks, I'll do my best...

## Talk 8

Kaedehara Kazuha: You gave an outstanding performance. Truly commendable.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I could sense that you are not familiar with bouts of this kind, and it could have cost you the match.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But you were quick to adapt, and managed to claim victory over your opponent. That is a most invaluable skill.
Traveler: You have a keen eye.
Kaedehara Kazuha: In fact, I discerned this not from what I saw, but what I heard — the ground beneath your feet and the pattern of your breathing. But it is nothing remarkable, for I discerned nothing more than Captain Beidou did.
Beidou: Ahaha, he's right. But in my case, I was purely relying on previous experience.
Beidou: I guess not using your elemental powers must be quite new for you, huh?
Traveler: It sure is.
Paimon: We wanted to ask about who our opponent will be in the final round. Do you think they'll be stronger than the one we faced in the semi-finals?
Beidou: Not exactly. Contenders that reach the finals aren't necessarily "stronger," they tend to have something unique about their style.
Beidou: As for the guy you'll be facing, his skill lies in his speed, and he has superior form. It's also obvious that he's seen his fair share of battles.
Beidou: What's the matter? Worried that you've bitten off more than you can chew this time?
Traveler: Better to be safe than sorry.
Kaedehara Kazuha: If that is the case, then I have a proposal for you. Let's go somewhere a little quieter, shall we?
Kaedehara Kazuha: I haven't properly introduced myself yet. In the land of Inazuma, I was a wandering samurai.
Paimon: Uh, yeah, we could tell that from your getup. But at the same time... When you talk, you don't really sound like someone who's used to waving a sword around...
Kaedehara Kazuha: It is true that I am versed both in literary and martial traditions. But on the straggling path of a wandering samurai, is there harm in acquiring a surplus skill?
Kaedehara Kazuha: I do not mean to flaunt my martial prowess, but I myself have witnessed reputable fighters hailing from across the lands. I do possess some knowledge regarding your opponent's particular skillset.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Given your talents, a few hints from me will be all that's necessary to bring your opponent down.
Beidou: Hang on! Don't you think you're bending the rules a bit there?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Gathering intelligence is an essential part of any duel. You must know your enemy.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Besides, our favorite here has fought many battles on their journey from Mondstadt. Such impressive feats require more than just bravery alone.
Paimon: You betcha!
Paimon: Huh, wait a second. We never told you that we've been to Mondstadt!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hehe, does one not leave a trail when traveling through the wild? In return, nature also leaves its traces upon you.
Kaedehara Kazuha: However, there is only so much that can be discerned from these traces. I sense that many things about you elude me still... These are the things I am curious to know about.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Come with me. Some post-match entertainment is in order.
Traveler: It's vital that we make it to Inazuma.
Traveler: Yeah, glad it's almost over!
Traveler: You are very observant.

## Talk 9

Kaedehara Kazuha: Now that we're alone, let me cut to the heart of the matter...
Kaedehara Kazuha: You are skilled in manipulating the elements. And not just a single element, but multiple. Is that correct?
Traveler: Ah, so you already know.
Paimon: Paimon knew that you were hinting at something from the moment we met. You've known all along.
Kaedehara Kazuha: That's right. If the other contenders were to catch wind of your elemental abilities, let's just say it would cause some unwanted misunderstandings.
Kaedehara Kazuha: If I'm not mistaken, you share these considerations, given your reluctance to use elemental skills even in the heat of a match.
Traveler: Yes, but how did you know?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hehe, when I talk about that which I see or hear in you, this is not poetic symbolism at play. I mean these things in the truest sense possible.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Since a young age, I have been attuned to the tidings of nature. I hear the breath of the wind and the whispers of the leaves.
Kaedehara Kazuha: It is things of this nature that I also hear from within you, nothing more.
Paimon: As crazy as all that sounds, somehow Paimon still believes you.
Kaedehara Kazuha: My humble abilities are negligible compared to your incredible feats.
Kaedehara Kazuha: To think a human could wield the elements without a Vision...
Kaedehara Kazuha: And not to mention your incredibly complex scent, like that of some mysterious being...
Paimon: Hey, stop evaluating us based on our smell! It's weird!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Could you perchance enlighten me as to how you managed to obtain your combined elemental abilities?
Traveler: I'm afraid I don't know either.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm, extraordinary.
Kaedehara Kazuha: So then, might I be so bold as to inquire how exactly it is that you learned to channel elemental energy, and even wield it in combat?
Traveler: It's all thanks to Paimon's knowledge.
Paimon: #Aw, it's nothing, really. Paimon just told {F#her}{M#him} whatever came to mind.
Paimon: #It's been a long journey, and many things have happened along the way. Somehow, {F#she}{M#he} just naturally learned to use the elements through it all...
Paimon: Honestly, even Paimon doesn't understand how it all works.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Perhaps such unfathomable things are the essence of the gods and the Visions they grant.
Kaedehara Kazuha: However, I still wish to have the honor of seeing how you wield the elements, perhaps it may yet reveal something to me.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Of course, I too shall share with you all that I've learned. That will make it a fair exchange.
Traveler: Fair enough.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Now then, let's test your skills, shall we?
Traveler: Finally, a real battle.
Traveler: It's all thanks to Paimon's companionship.
Traveler: All I did was touch a Statue of The Seven.
Traveler: No wonder you didn't bring this up at the arena.

## Talk 10

Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm, your skills in battle are truly beyond reproach. Even with your opponent's speed, he shouldn't be able to overwhelm you.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Your opponent is skilled at controlling his breathing and maintaining balance, which enables him to execute moves that many would find impossible.
Kaedehara Kazuha: He relies entirely on the element of surprise to defeat his opponents.
Kaedehara Kazuha: In other words, as long as you remain mindful of his ability to detect weak points, then his attacks should pose no threat to you.
Traveler: Thank you, I will not underestimate him.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Please, save your thanks. If anything, I should be thanking you for the opportunity to witness your command of the elements that defies all known principles.
Kaedehara Kazuha: The world is a truly mysterious place, it seems, and one will always encounter that which is still unknown.
Paimon: You seem kinda obsessed with Visions... but don't you already have your own? Why are you so intent on exploring the connection between Visions and the elements?
Kaedehara Kazuha: I desire to know what meaning Visions have to the gods.
Kaedehara Kazuha: And what influences the gods' decision to grant humans these Visions.
Kaedehara Kazuha: My apologies, you must be completely in the dark regarding such matters.
Kaedehara Kazuha: For allowing me the honor of witnessing your mystical ways, I am willing to answer any questions you may have regarding Inazuma.
Traveler: I am indeed in the dark, so please enlighten me.
Kaedehara Kazuha: So that's what you're curious about? Haha, then allow me to tell you more.
Kaedehara Kazuha: As you well know, a Vision Hunt Decree is currently underway in Inazuma.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Visions are a gift bestowed by the divine. People that have accepted this gift are now having their Visions confiscated inexplicably, sometimes in circumstances that leave their original recipients dead.
Kaedehara Kazuha: In the outset, supposing each of the Seven Archons had their criteria for granting Visions to living beings — then, does the current Electro Archon now doubt these criteria, or even the act in and of itself?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Not to mention, with no new Electro Visions having been granted for such a long time, it would seem that we can infer something of the Raiden Shogun's feelings on the matter...
Paimon: She sounds less like an archon and more like... a tyrant.
Kaedehara Kazuha: As far as I know, she is an archon that pursues "eternity." She will relentlessly carry out her will with no regard to what others may think or feel.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Liyue's "contracts" are meant to benefit all who reside within Liyue. But what does Inazuma's pursuit of "eternity" bring to its people?
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...It goes without saying that the people locked within Inazuma do not fare well these days.
Paimon: Sounds a lot like something the god you encountered in the beginning would do.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Oh? Have you encountered the Electro Archon before?
Traveler: I'm not sure.
Kaedehara Kazuha: With time, we will change. But the shogun will remain the same.
Kaedehara Kazuha: If you wish to find her, she will forever be there.
Kaedehara Kazuha: There will come a day when I too shall wish to understand the answers to "eternity" from her.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Ah! The time for your match is approaching.
Paimon: Oh, right! We got so distracted talking about Inazuma that Paimon forgot all about the tournament!
Kaedehara Kazuha: If you have no other matters to attend to, then we can return together.
Traveler: Sure, let's go together.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Very well, let's go. I wish to see who will obtain the Vision.
Traveler: I'll head back on my own shortly.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Very well. Just be sure to not be late for the match.
Traveler: It was already a long time ago now.

Beidou: Kazuha has had his eye on you from the moment you arrived.
Beidou: If you've got anything to ask him, this'll be your chance.

### Additional Talk 2

Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm... You control the elements without a Vision, that means...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Oh, pay no attention to me, I was just talking to myself. Ahem... I will be sure to observe your battle intently.
