# Charity Event? Securing Funds?


## Talk 1

Bernhard: Wait! Honorary Knight! And Paimon, the best guide in Teyvat!
Bernhard: I humbly beg for your assistance!
Paimon: Whoa! Did Paimon hear that right? Is Paimon finally starting to make a name for herself?
Paimon: Oh, wait... haven't we met...?
Traveler: Yes, in the main hall of the Knights of Favonius Headquarters.
Bernhard: That's right. I am Bernhard, a member of the Logistics Company under Captain Hertha.
Bernhard: Normally, I would hope to become better acquainted before asking for a favor like this... but time's running out, so I really have no choice.
Bernhard: Please help me rescue the charity event!
Traveler: "Rescue"?
Paimon: The charity event? Oh right, Master Jean mentioned that. So what's happened?
Bernhard: Well, the Knights of Favonius wants to run a stall during the festival...
Bernhard: The idea is for all profits from the sales to go to charity. Specifically, the funds will provide support to disadvantaged children and elderly citizens.
Bernhard: We drew lots to decide whose job it would be, and as it happened... I was the lucky winner. I really didn't want to screw this up, so I asked all around for advice, but...
Bernhard: My experience is in inventory and shipping. Now I'm supposed to run a whole shop, but it took me forever just to think of what to sell... I'm already completely out of my depth.
Bernhard: And that is why I humbly beseech you to render your assistance...
Traveler: I understand.
Paimon: Yeah! Also, no need to be so formal.
Paimon: So, you said this is to help out the kids and old folks of Mondstadt, right? Sounds like a great cause!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME} is an Honorary Knight, and Paimon's a longtime friend of Favonius. We'll be more than happy to do our part.
Traveler: As Paimon says, we are happy to help.
Bernhard: Oh, I can't thank you enough! Right, let me get down to brass tacks...
Bernhard: Before we can open shop, we need to amass a supply of <color=#00E1FFFF>Fairbrew Jellies</color>. This is the basic currency that we will use when running the stall.
Bernhard: The wine merchants in the area are in dire need of raw ingredients for wine-making. Sell them raw ingredients, and they will pay you generously in Fairbrew Jellies.
Bernhard: Also, there are some international customers looking to purchase beverages in bulk during the Weinlesefest period. They're on the market for an agent to handle their purchase orders.
Bernhard: In the interests of establishing a long-term business relationship, these customers are usually willing to offer a generous price, and there's also room for negotiation with the wine merchants.
Bernhard: The price difference is ours to keep as commission, and you can cash that amount in for Fairbrew Jellies.
Paimon: So to sum up, our job is to sell ingredients to the wine merchants, and place orders for international customers, making sure to negotiate the price. Right?
Paimon: Sounds much easier than Paimon imagined!
Traveler: We're pretty good at this.
Bernhard: R—Really? Well, that's wonderful!
Bernhard: I have one order here with me already: A Mr. Shevirme from Sumeru wishes to purchase <color=#00E1FFFF>50 crates of Fruits of the Festival</color>.
Bernhard: These beverages can be bought from the <color=#00E1FFFF>Angel's Share's stand</color>. The shopkeeper's name is <color=#00E1FFFF>Georg</color>.
Bernhard: He's a very nice man, but he won't be pushed around. Please consider the price carefully and try to reach a good deal with Georg.
Bernhard: I should carry on setting up the stall now. Once you've gathered enough Fairbrew Jellies, come back here and we'll take it from there.
Bernhard: You won't need to worry about the supplies for the shop.
Bernhard: I'm already in contact with the suppliers, and they'll send everything over once the funds are in place.
Paimon: Alright, sounds good! We'll find the funds and you sort out the shop.
Bernhard: This is an enormous help. Thank you both ever so much!
Traveler: What do you need from us?
Traveler: Everyone has things that they struggle with.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hi there, Georg. We're Shevirme's agents. He's asked us to order 50 crates of Fruits of the Festival for him.
Georg: Oh? Did you say Shevirme? He's a regular customer of mine. Always orders around the same amount each time...
Georg: But I digress — what price are you offering this year?

## Talk 3

Barbara: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon! You're here!
Paimon: Hey! It's Barbara!
Traveler: Hi, Barbara.
Barbara: Thanks! And happy Weinlesefest to you, too!
Barbara: This festival is one of the most popular ones in Mondstadt. I'm so happy I ran into you guys here. I hope you have a great time!
Barbara: Oh, also, I heard from Georg that you're collecting Fairbrew Jellies?
Barbara: I'm just curious, are you helping out with the Knights of Favonius charity event?
Paimon: We sure are! Everybody's gotta do their part, right?
Paimon: The stall isn't up and running yet. We're busy raising funds so they can open for business!
Paimon: There's sure to be a bunch of other problems to deal with once it's open, but whatever comes up, we'll deal with it!
Barbara: Wonderful! Heehee... they're lucky to have you. Now that you've joined the team, I just know it'll be a huge success!
Traveler: Thanks for your encouragement!
Barbara: I helped out at a small charity sale for the Knights once, too.
Barbara: Although... my only contribution was standing out front and singing...
Barbara: Oh! And I also met the bard, Venti there! He even persuaded me to perform an impromptu song with him...
Barbara: The music he plays is quite refined and elegant. At first, I didn't want to sing too loudly, in case I ruined the style he was going for...
Barbara: But he sang a harmony to guide me in, and before long, we were sounding great.
Barbara: In the end, the audience loved it, and we sold a lot at the event.
Paimon: So Barbara's worked with the Tone-Deaf Bard before...
Traveler: I wish I could have been there to hear it.
Barbara: Yeah... too bad we couldn't fit it into the schedule this year.
Barbara: The Church of Favonius wants to hold a sung poetry event somewhere with a nice view during the festival, which means I have to go to rehearsal...
Traveler: Go do what you have to do, it's alright.
Paimon: Yup, sounds like we've each got our own important work to do. Let's give it our all.
Barbara: Thank you both! Well, maybe I can't stay here and sing, but I still wanna do a little something to contribute!
Barbara: I can, um... I can help promote your stall.
Barbara: Hmm... Should I make some big posters? Or maybe some flyers to hand out?
Barbara: I'll have to pick a memorable slogan, too! And maybe it'll seem more sincere if I sign them...?
Barbara: Then again, maybe telling people in person would be more effective...
Paimon: Wow, with Barbara helping out on the marketing side, this charity event will get loads more attention!
Traveler: Sounds like a lot of effort...
Barbara: It's fine, really! It won't take me too long. Now I feel a little embarrassed, heh...
Barbara: #Let me think about it a little more and talk to some other people about their marketing experience! {NICKNAME}, Paimon, I'll see you later~
Barbara: And, um... the Knights and the Church of Favonius are really proud of you!
Paimon: Aww, thanks! We'll do our best.
Paimon: #Paimon's even more motivated than ever now! {NICKNAME}, we gotta make sure we do a really great job here!
Traveler: You have so much on your plate already.
Traveler: We'll take care of the charity event.
Traveler: Happy Weinlesefest!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Georg: I'm sorry — Did you even speak to Shevirme before deciding on a price? You must be joking, that's much too low.

### Additional Talk 2

Georg: Look, I know we've had a great harvest this year and our production costs have gone down a fair amount, but even then... I'm afraid this price is just not doable.

### Additional Talk 3

Georg: Sounds good to me, that's around the same price we've agreed in previous years, too. We have a deal!

### Additional Talk 4

Georg: Hmm... A little lower than I was hoping for. But he's a reliable customer. I think I can make it work.

### Additional Talk 5

Georg: I'm sorry, but I just can't consider going that low. If you're serious about placing an order, please, just take my price.

### Additional Talk 6

Georg: As usual, I will arrange for someone to deliver the goods directly to Shevirme's place of business.
Georg: You won't have to worry about a thing. Just make sure you keep hold of this receipt.
Paimon: Alright, let's keep bringing the funds in. We gotta work quickly if we wanna gather all these Fairbrew Jellies in time!
Paimon: Bernhard says we can approach this however we want, just as long as we raise all the funds we need...
Paimon: We get a commission for every order we help place for an international customer. So maybe it's not worth trying to sell loads of ingredients to the wine merchants...
Paimon: Still... just to make sure we've covered everything, let's take a look at the other wine merchants.
