Ferdinand: Oh, what brings you here today? Hehe, wanna try riding the Choo-Choo Cart? We operate 24/7!

## Talk

Traveler: No track repairs today?
Ferdinand: Aw, come on, what kind of rails need to be repaired daily... And thanks to you, we just fixed 'em! From now on we'll only need to do regular maintenance.
Ferdinand: Though... if Haddo starts designing some new track, then we'll have some serious work to do.
Ferdinand: Jeroney is the brain, Haddo is the designer, and I'm the brawn. That's how it works.

## Talk

Traveler: And I'm just passing by...
Ferdinand: If you got the time, ride the Choo-Choo Cart more! Tell me what you think, and I'll have Haddo and Jeroney improve it!

## Talk

Traveler: Sounds like hard work...
Ferdinand: Heh, it's the Hydro Eidolons that are really doing the heavy-lifting for us. Besides, if you want to make a new track, someone's gotta work hard for it.
Ferdinand: ...*ahem* Feels like I'm complaining. Nope, no more of that.
Ferdinand: The carts and rails are designed for first and foremost to make people happy. Passengers having fun is the only thing that matters.
Ferdinand: If passengers heard my complaining, they might feel bad riding the carts! That wouldn't be fun for them, haha!
