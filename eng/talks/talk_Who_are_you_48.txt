Traveler: Who are you?
Qian: I work as a miner, or at least that's what I used to do. Now that the Chasm's been sealed off, I just wander around without a job to do.
Qian: I've heard that limited production has resumed, but I wasn't put on the list of workers.
Qian: Maybe if I had something to do, I wouldn't be so picky about what to eat. But now that I've already tried all the places around here, I don't have a clue what I want to eat today.
