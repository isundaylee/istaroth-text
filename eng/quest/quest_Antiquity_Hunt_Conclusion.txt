# Antiquity Hunt: Conclusion

Daneh: Oh? Have you found all the replicas?
Daneh: Marvelous! You really do have a knack for this, don't you?
Daneh: Well then. This gift is for you. Thanks for taking part in the event organized by our Darshan.
Daneh: I hope that you've been able to enjoy your taste of archaeology, Traveler.
Daneh: That said, real-life archaeology tends to be rather dry and labor-intensive work...
Daneh: But the instant you find that key relic, you will feel as if the struggle was all worth it.
Traveler: And if you fail to dig anything up?
Daneh: Well, if we don't find anything, then this is, as they say, "a waste of effort."
Daneh: And to be honest, this is actually what happens more often than not. The instances where we do find something important are quite rare indeed.
Daneh: But to work in archaeology is to be used to such circumstances and stay optimistic even so. It would only be a matter of time before we collapsed otherwise.
Traveler: I'm quite sure there are situations in which you find nothing.
