Hongyu: I saw a white-haired lady around these parts a couple of days ago. She was incredibly beautiful â€” had an extraordinary air about her to boot.
Hongyu: But just as I wanted to get a closer look, she suddenly disappeared...
Hongyu: Actually, now that I think about it, did I encounter some passing adeptus?

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Hongyu: I was there at the Rite of Descension too. The Qixing had ordered us to maintain absolute secrecy regarding the matter at the time.
Hongyu: But now that the Rite of Parting is finished, everyone is aware of the situation. There's no need for us Millelith to keep silent about it any longer...
Hongyu: But even so... I'm sorry, I still can't bring myself to discuss this topic any further.
Hongyu: Rex Lapis... *sigh*

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Hongyu: Whoa, come on now. When I said we could chat, I didn't mean sensitive topics like that. That's off limits.
Hongyu: Take it from me, no self-respecting Liyue local is gonna want to broach that topic lightly.
Hongyu: ...Ahem, I must stay at my post. If there's nothing else you need, please leave me be.

Traveler: Who are you?
Hongyu: We're the Millelith guards for this area. I'm Hongyu, and that's Kun.
Hongyu: Liyue Harbor's a pretty safe place. I've not seen any big trouble the whole time I've been in uniform. Maybe you get a few more pickpockets and petty thieves around Chihu Rock, but that's about it.
Hongyu: Hey, have you heard about Lantern Rite?
Hongyu: It's a festival people in Liyue celebrate. Takes place on the night of the first full moon every year. It's the biggest festival of the whole year, too.
Hongyu: On the night of the festival, the whole city lights lanterns all night long. It makes the place as bright as day.
Hongyu: Also, we have a special floating lantern too. Unique to Liyue. It's quite a sight to behold, and you won't find anything like it elsewhere.
Hongyu: Anyway, just thought if you're new in town, it's something you definitely wouldn't want to miss!

Traveler: Anything interesting happening around here?
Hongyu: No, I wouldn't say that anything interesting has happened. But I did encounter something weird recently...
Hongyu: There was something not quite right about my house. If it wasn't a bowl or chopsticks moving all of a sudden, then it was a chair suddenly falling over.
Hongyu: After talking things through with a friend, he introduced me to an exorcist named Chongyun. They say that he's a specialist in these bump-in-the-night matters.
Hongyu: But the instant that exorcist walked into the room, all the strange happenings stopped right away! He didn't even have to work any thaumaturgy!
Hongyu: It truly is weird. I still have no idea how that might have happened...

Traveler: Sorry, I have things to do.
Hongyu: *sigh* Okay then. Shame, don't get this sort of freedom very often.
