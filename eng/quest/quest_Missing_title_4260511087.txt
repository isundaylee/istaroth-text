Traveler: Why's it so chilly here?
Ivanovich: You too? Aha, so it's not just me, after all...
Ivanovich: I'm wearing plenty of layers, but somehow I'm so cold that I can't stop shivering. Let me see what's going on...
Ivanovich: Aha! Turns out I had this stone in my pocket all along. Hmm, must have slipped in there somehow while I was back home...
Ivanovich: Hmm? Piqued your curiosity, has it? Well, it's not classed as ore, and I certainly can't sell it here... So, I may as well let you have it.
