# Missing title (4098730455)


## Talk 1

Muning: Have you found the Archaic Stones?
Traveler: Here they are.

## Talk 2

Muning: With these three included, it's nine in total. They should be enough.
Muning: You managed to gather what Huishan Hall needs so quickly. No wonder they speak so highly of you!
Paimon: Eh, it was easy! Easy-peasy, lemon-breezy!
Traveler: I'm sure it's "lemon-squeezy," Paimon...
Paimon: Eh? Uh, well, lemons can be breezy too!
Traveler: Oh, look at you, forcing your logic through. Most impressive.
Muning: Haha... We've all witnessed your heroic deeds of fighting the sea monster. I believe it was no challenge for you to accomplish such a feat.
Traveler: No challenge at all indeed.
Muning: Well, so much for working at the Ministry of Civil Affairs. They still ask you to do stuff like "look for Archaic Stone in The Chasm"...
Paimon: Speaking of which, you said you often argued with your father back then and didn't have a job.
Paimon: Then how did you make it into the Ministry later?
Muning: You know how I owed a big sum at the time? I could turn to no one, nor was I willing to go home.
Muning: In the end, the debt collectors came looking for my old man at the Shenglu Hall... I thought he'd come find me to break my legs upon hearing the news.
Paimon: But your legs look fine.
Muning: Yes... It's embarrassing to say, but he cleared my debt and came looking for me. By the time he found me, I was almost like a beaten-up dog on the street. He said, "I have all your IOUs, so now you're indebted to me."
Muning: With that, he forced me to work — to pay my debt.
Paimon: So your father is your creditor now.
Muning: You can say that...
Muning: Back then, with the debt collectors after me, I couldn't even fall asleep at night. So, I swore that I'd mend my ways if I was given a second chance.
Muning: But I didn't expect the chance to come from my father, who always disapproved of my behaviors...
Muning: He didn't lash out at me as usual. Instead, we had a talk — an honest and sincere one. How I wish we could've talked this way earlier.
Muning: But even if he'd been open for a talk, I wouldn't have been willing to listen.
Paimon: Looks like your father treats you well.
Muning: Yeah.
Muning: So I have to get my job done well under whatever circumstances.
Muning: Whether it's the incident in The Chasm or the search for Archaic Stone requested by Huishan Hall.
Traveler: I believe I'm the one who did the job for you this time...
Muning: Having people get the job done also counts.
Muning: But still, it's all thanks to you that we moved swimmingly — I'd say it was way more quickly than I expected.
Paimon: Huh, Paimon finally senses a touch of gratitude there.
Traveler: It's actually a bit of a challenge...
