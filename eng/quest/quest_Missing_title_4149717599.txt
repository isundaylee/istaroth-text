## Talk 1

Arapandu: #Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon! Thanks to your help, the Varuna Contraption is now in good shape, and so is the Ashavan Realm.
Arakunti: All Aranara have returned to Vanarana for the celebration of Festival Utsava, like birds returning to their nests.
Aranakula: The angry rain becomes gentle again. And Aranakula finally gets to take care of the garden, growing Viparyas, happy Viparyas...
Arakara: Happy Viparyas make happy lanterns, and happy lanterns light the happy Festival Utsava...
Arakara: #Nara {NICKNAME}, Paimon, the garden is doing great now, and Festival Utsava was a blast. Thank you for your help with healing the Varuna Contraption and bringing Aranakula back.
Paimon: All's well that ends well! Hee-hee...
Traveler: Speaking of which... I'm quite curious about something...
Traveler: Why is Nara Varuna named Nara Varuna?
Arapandu: Oh, it's because that Nara helped us heal the Varuna Contraption.
Traveler: #Then what's {M#her}{F#his} real name?
Arapandu: #Um... No idea. Nara Varuna never told us {M#her}{F#his} real name.
Traveler: ...
Arabalika: #Nara {NICKNAME} has also helped a lot. Nara {NICKNAME} is a brave Nara and has overcome many difficulties. That we can gather here together at Festival Utsava makes me very happy.
Arakunti: #We have something for Nara {NICKNAME}.
Arapandu: This is how Aranara say thank you.
Aranakula: #Nara {NICKNAME} will like it, and so will Paimon.
Arabalika: Here is an Aranara flower for brave Nara and Paimon.
Arakara: #Arakara also has a flower. It's not a Viparyas, but still, it's for Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon!
Arapandu: #Nara {NICKNAME}, Paimon, thanks for everything you did for Vana. We Aranara will never forget our friends!
Traveler: I see.

## Talk 2

Ararycan: #Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon! Don't worry. The baddies that made Vanarana sick won't be coming back!
Ararycan: #Thank you, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon for helping Ararycan protect Vanarana. Ararycan has flowers for you!
Ararycan: Take the flowers, friends of Ararycan!
