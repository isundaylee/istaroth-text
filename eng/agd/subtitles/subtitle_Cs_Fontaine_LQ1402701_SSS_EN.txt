Long ago, humans rejected Melusines, and Melusines feared humans
There was one Melusine who became fascinated with human medicine
But no human wanted her help
And there was one girl who liked Melusines
So no humans would make friends with her
So, the Melusine became the girl's friend
And the girl became the Melusine's "patient"
Your checkup's all done. You're still in perfect health
Thank you, Doctor Melusine!
In this game of doctor and patient, a friendship was born
Then one day, the girl fell ill
The Melusine was the only doctor to arrive on time
But the adults sent her away
Scram! Melusines can't be trusted!
So just because I'm not human... I can't save my best friend?
In desperation, the Melusine approached the frightening witch
She begged, and begged, until she got a reply
If you take this potion, concocted of sin
You will gain a human face and grow human limbs
But then, you will lose everything that attracted this friend of yours to you in the first place
Can you accept that?
The Melusine did not hesitate for very long
On a rainy night, a little doctor knocked on the girl's door
The doctor wore a hood and raincoat
Maybe to protect her from the rain... but maybe also to hide a secret
The little doctor held the girl's hand and treated her illness
Just as she had so many times before
Dawn came, and the little girl's condition improved
But the little doctor was long gone
For she knew her friend would never recognize her again
