# Within the Depths of Erinnyes


## Talk 1

Pahsiv: Root, very far ahead, very deep...
Paimon: Then we will keep going!
Paimon: Pahsiv, what else do you know about the purple thing?
Pahsiv: Purple thing, very scary. Pahsiv, go near, scared...
Pahsiv: Purple thing, blue thing, fight.
Paimon: The blue thing... A vishap, perhaps? A vishap was fighting the purple thing?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv! But... purple thing, very scary. Blue thing, lost lots of.
Paimon: Lost? Oh... Um, sorry...
Paimon: #But don't worry, Traveler is very powerful, too! Traveler's taken down just about everything before.

## Talk 2

Keratry: Brother! Look! There seems to be a hole in the fountain. Was that your magic?
Remaudiere: ...Uh... Yes, that's right! That was your brother's magic, indeed. Awesome, right?
Keratry: Yup! I didn't think you'd have a trick that's as good as the Great Magician Lyney's!
Remaudiere: Ahem...

## Talk 3

Pahsiv: Root... Root...
Paimon: We're finally here! Whoa, that's a whole load of funky stuff. Paimon doesn't see anyone around, but she's getting a familiar feeling... Evil's gotta be lurking nearby...
Pahsiv: Willow... Root...
Paimon: Are these the roots of that great tree from earlier?
Paimon: Paimon gets it now! That's why the great tree looked so sickly. The roots have been corrupted!
Pahsiv: Root... Melusine...
Paimon: #Traveler, let's clean up all this filth. Paimon reckons they're corrupting the roots.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Ugh, this is tough. This pollution's impossible to clear up!
Pahsiv: Pahsiv, ka-pow!
Black Screen Text: Pahsiv touches your stomach with her hand, and you feel a warmth coming from her palm.
You feel like something in you has been enhanced.
Pahsiv: Pahsiv, tired...
Paimon: #What did Pahsiv do? You look revitalized, Traveler!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Finally, it's all gone. Paimon didn't know that you had such a marvelous ability, Pahsiv...
Paimon: Now... Wait... Something's lit up on the ground... It's some kinda arcane formation!
Paimon: Agh! Rifthounds are charging out!
Pahsiv: Purple thing...
Paimon: Don't worry, Pahsiv. We'll protect you!
Paimon: Wait! Where are you going, Pahsiv? Stop! This place is dangerous!

## Talk 6

Paimon: #Phew! Finally, that's that under control. We sure kicked the Rifthound nest, huh? Traveler, how are you doing?
Traveler: I can do this all day.
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon's sure that wasn't just you boasting. It looks like the roots are recovering â€” guess that means the problem here has been cleared up, right?
Paimon: But what happened just then? A vishap turned up to help, and Pahsiv disappeared...
Paimon: Hey! Pahsiv! Are you there? Can you hear Paimon?
Paimon: Okay, looks like she's really disappeared.
Traveler: She's got plenty of secrets, for sure.
Paimon: Hmm... She's such a mysterious Melusine. Paimon knows she didn't want any reward, but it still seems odd to just leave like that...
Traveler: Why?
Paimon: It's as if... It's as if you had a favorite food, and then one day, the food looks at you and says "guess we're through."
Traveler: That would be upsetting, yes.
Paimon: Well, it's the same kind of feeling, y'know? But what if Pahsiv was injured? She seemed exhausted...
Traveler: Maybe we can look for her nearby.
Paimon: Yes! Paimon thinks we should do that. Just in case she might be in danger, and all!
Paimon: Wait... What's wrong!?
Black Screen Text: Just as you are about to look for Pahsiv, water floods into the cave, sweeping you toward the surface.
Traveler: Although talking food seems even odder.
Traveler: My hands are just a bit sore.

## Talk 7

Pahsiv: Key, statue, key, statue, key, statue.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Oh no! We didn't get a chance to look for her!
Traveler: Don't worry. I'm sure she can swim.
Paimon: That's true, but... Whoa! Look at the great tree!
Paimon: It's recovered, and it's so pretty! Is that what it looked like before? Pahsiv will be happy if she sees it, won't she?
Pahsiv: #Paimon! Pahsiv! Traveler! Pahsiv!
Paimon: Pahsiv? Great! Where did you go? We were so worried!
Pahsiv: Disappeared, Pahsiv.
Pahsiv: Ah... Box. Pahsiv!
Paimon: What? Is that a treasure chest? You went looking for treasure chests?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv! But, shiny, round, Melusine...
Paimon: You didn't find any Mora? That's fine. The chest is more than enough!
Paimon: You remembered what Paimon told you! Oh, you're gonna make Paimon cry! Thank you, Pahsiv!
Pahsiv: Thank... you...?
Traveler: It means Pahsiv!
Pahsiv: #Paimon, thank you! Traveler, thank you!
Pahsiv: #Paimon, good thing! Traveler, good thing!
Traveler: Pahsiv, good thing!
Paimon: Pahsiv, good thing!
Paimon: #Traveler, we should come to see Pahsiv often when we have time, and teach her more words, like the visitor did.
Traveler: Pahsiv!
Paimon: What do you think, Pahsiv? Can we come back to play with you?
Paimon: Where did she go this time?
Traveler: Pahsiv, disappeared!
Paimon: Wow! Paimon has never seen a Melusine like her. Or rather... She doesn't behave like a Melusine, but more like a wild fairy.
Paimon: Maybe that's why she can spy on the purple thing quietly.
Paimon: Hey, Pahsiv! Goodbye! If we meet again, we'll teach you how to say goodbye properly!
