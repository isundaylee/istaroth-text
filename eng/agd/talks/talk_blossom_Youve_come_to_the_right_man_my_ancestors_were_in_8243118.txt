Pan Guan'er: You've come to the right man, my ancestors were in the mining business. As such, I can discern the quality of ore with but one look. That's why they call me "Pan Guan'er."
Pan Guan'er: I've heard that these Crystal Ores were formed under the influence of Ley Line energies. They are very hard to come by, and very few smiths know how to work them.
Pan Guan'er: In the past two days, I discovered Magical Crystal Ores nearby â€” true treasures, and no mistake!
Pan Guan'er: My father once told me that such ores were born from the influence of Ley Line energies, and are more valuable than Crystal Ores by far!
Pan Guan'er: I've marked the locations out on your map. If you check those spots out, you're bound to reap quite the harvest!
