Traveler: About dancing...
Kumari: Why won't Dad let me learn to dance...?
Kumari: He said dancing was looked down upon in Sumeru. To live a better life, I should go to school instead of learning how to dance.
Kumari: Bâ€”But, Nilou is so good at dancing, and everybody loves her so much...
Kumari: Is success at school more desirable than being a good dancer?
