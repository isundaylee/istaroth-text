# Versus Taroumaru

Taroumaru: Woof! Woof, woof! Woof!
Traveler: Eh? It's Taroumaru?
Paimon: Huh, Yasuhiko Tarou did say earlier that the fourth warrior came because they lacked some Mora on hand. Guess Taroumaru's in it for the prize as well, huh?
Paimon: Well, sorry, Taroumaru, but Paimon isn't gonna give an inch when it comes to Mora!
Taroumaru: Woof?
Taroumaru: Woof, woof woof! Woof, woof!
Traveler: Taroumaru's barking is getting louder...
Paimon: #Taroumaru, this is a most solemn duel. The prize must go to the one who is more skilled in martial arts between yourself and {NICKNAME}.
Paimon: But if we win... we can buy you some tasty snacks to eat.
Taroumaru: Woof, woof woof! Woof, woof!
Traveler: I didn't get that, but bring it on anyway.
Taroumaru: Woof!
Traveler: Not that I understood that, but give me a moment to prepare.
Taroumaru: Woof, woof, woof!
Traveler: Did you cheese him off somehow...
Traveler: The "mightiest warrior" is Taroumaru!
