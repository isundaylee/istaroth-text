# Blackcliff Woes


## Talk 1

Manager Kuan: *sigh* How did this happen...
Traveler: Is something wrong?
Manager Kuan: Oh, what would it be if not the problem with the Blackcliff Forge? Things were going so well for us, too. Ore production was high and workplace accidents were low.
Manager Kuan: But a band of monsters suddenly came out of nowhere and took over one of our work sites.
Manager Kuan: The Millelith tried to give them the boot many times, but they returned with greater numbers every single time.
Manager Kuan: To ensure the workers' safety, I had to pull everyone back from the area.
Manager Kuan: But if that site is down, the production pressures on the others go up. This could throw the whole Forge's production schedules into disarray!
Manager Kuan: And I would go myself to investigate, but I dare not leave my daughter here or bring her along...
Manager Kuan: If you would, Traveler, could you go to that worksite and help me check it out?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Manager Kuan: Thanks. I'll be waiting for you here.

## Talk 2

Traveler: Allow me.
Manager Kuan: Thank you very much. I'll be waiting for you here.

## Talk 3

Traveler: Work at the Blackcliff Forge has been stopped?
Manager Kuan: It has. The order for us to cease work was sent directly from the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Manager Kuan: How could they just stop work at the drop of a hat like that? How will everyone get by? And we need their approval to resume work as well... *sigh*
Manager Kuan: Please, help me to investigate the area around the Chasm.

## Talk 4

Manager Kuan: *sigh* Where did those monsters come from...

## Talk 5

Manager Kuan: What's the situation?
Traveler: It's full of monsters.
Manager Kuan: Is that so... *sigh* Then it seems like that work site can't be reopened.
Manager Kuan: I understand the situation. Please take this as thanks for your help.
Manager Kuan: But at this rate, our quotas are going to require some extensions.
Manager Kuan: Gah, I have to find some place where we can start work...
Traveler: It's full of Treasure Hoarders.
Manager Kuan: Treasure Hoarders? And lots of monsters too? Ugh...
Manager Kuan: Those Treasure Hoarders would really do anything for Mora, huh...
Manager Kuan: Then it does indeed seem like that work site can't be reopened.
