# Starsail Coin

A custom coin with a starry emblem carved into it. Exquisitely crafted, it seems to carry the blessings of the one who made it. And who knows? Perhaps good things will come when you use it!
You can use it to obtain fairytale figurines from Fantastical Fabricators in the "Summertide Scales and Tales" event.
