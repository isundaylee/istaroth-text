# Recuperating From a Severe Illness


## Talk 1

Anthony: Oh, that girl, where has she run off to this time...
Traveler: Anna's gone out to play again?
Anthony: Really, how can you be so unperturbed?
Anthony: Anna's become less and less obedient. I turn around for one second, and she just slips away.
Anthony: She hasn't fully recovered yet! Please help me find her.
Traveler: Alright.
Anthony: Thank you.
Anthony: Ah, right. Anna always told me that she wanted to see the statue of the Anemo Archon.
Anthony: I remember that Sister Grace goes there often.
Anthony: You could go ask her first. Maybe she's noticed something...
Traveler: Have you looked around?
Anthony: Of course. I even searched outside the city!
Anthony: But still, no luck. So I could only turn to you.
Traveler: What does she like to eat?
Anthony: Well, she's fond of... Hey! Haven't I told you to stop treating her like a cat?
Anthony: In any case, she loves all sorts of food, more than I can count.
Anthony: Okay, I'm counting on you to look for her. I'll be waiting for you here. I'm so tired, I feel like I could collapse...

## Talk 2

Anna: So you really can see all of Mondstadt from up here...
Traveler: Don't catch a cold, now.
Anna: Wah! You gave me a fright, where'd you come from?
Anna: I bet my brother's looking for me again. Haha, I knew he wouldn't find me here.
Anna: I know, I know. I get it, I'll go back in a while. I won't make him worry.

## Talk 3

Anthony: Have you found Anna already?
Traveler: She's on the Anemo Archon statue's hand.
Anthony: The—The Anemo Archon statue's hand? How did she even get up there?
Anthony: I'll head there immediately, get her to come down, and scold her a bit.
Anthony: My thanks. Please, take these.

## Talk 4

Grace: Hasn't this child always been ill? So how...
Traveler: Have you seen a certain girl...
Grace: Ha... You must be referring to Anna. Look up — she's in the hands of the Anemo Archon statue.
Grace: Honestly, I was quite stunned when she ran past me. I mean, she's been ill all this time, so where did she get this much energy from?
Grace: By the time I recovered, she'd already gone all the way up to the Anemo Archon statue's hands.
Traveler: You're... not angry?
Grace: Angry? Well, I was a little angry. But that child has always been tormented by her sickness...
Grace: Seeing her healthy like this... How do I say this? I just can't get angry.
Grace: That said, the wind is very strong up there. I hope she doesn't catch a cold...

## Talk 5

Anna: So you really can see all of Mondstadt from up here...
Traveler: Don't catch a cold, now.
Anna: Wah! You gave me a scare. Where did you pop out from, and how did you find me?
Anna: I was so sure no one would find me here...
Anna: Ah, right. Sister Grace must have told you where I am. She's always around here.
Anna: A lot of the medicine I've taken in the past were sent over by her.
Anna: Sister Grace is a wonderful person... But I don't want to stay in Mondstadt forever.
Anna: Alright, I know my brother's looking for me. I'll head back soon, so he doesn't worry.

## Talk 6

Anthony: Have you managed to find Anna?
Traveler: She's on the Anemo Archon statue's hand.
Anthony: The—The Anemo Archon statue's hand? How did she even get up there?
Anthony: Ah, we've made trouble for Sister Grace again. I mean, we always do, but...
Anthony: I'll head there immediately, get her to come down, and scold her a bit.
Anthony: My thanks. Please, take these.
