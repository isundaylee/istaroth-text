Traveler: So, what are you doing?
Jiawei: I'm preparing ingredients, of course, haha!
Jiawei: My wife really loves eating fish and is always hankering after something made from a fresh catch of mine. That's just how it is, you know?
Jiawei: The good news is that I'm a dab hand and then some at fishing. After all, I am an elite fisherman â€” I even once put out to sea to catch a fish of legendary size back in the day.
Jiawei: That was before I met her, of course, and I'm not going to delve into ancient history. Did you need something from me?
