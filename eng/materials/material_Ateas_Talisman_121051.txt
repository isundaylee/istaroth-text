# Atea's Talisman

"Sometimes I wonder â€” what if the hot springs were never to dry, nor friends to say goodbye..."
"If this land was no longer plagued by darkness, and our children could relish the joys within their reach, free from both care and worry..."
"If a world like that could really exist, just knowing it could would be enough, even if I didn't live to see it... Mavuika, my hot spring buddy and the god I trust and follow..."
"The flames bind us close, and even death cannot part us. Natlan is with you, and no one fights alone."
