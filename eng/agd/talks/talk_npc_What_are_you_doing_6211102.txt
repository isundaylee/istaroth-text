Traveler: What are you doing?
Aunt Qiao: Oh, just helping out with the stalls as well as an old lady can.
Aunt Qiao: I know all the vendors here very well. The ones who sell cups of tea, leaf tea, and tea eggs.
Aunt Qiao: When something comes up, they all feel safest asking me to watch their stalls for them.
