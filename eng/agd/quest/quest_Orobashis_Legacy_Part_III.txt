# Orobashi's Legacy: Part III


## Talk 1

Place: It seems that two critical components are missing from the ward.
Traveler: Submit Item

## Talk 2

Kaji: How're things going? Have you finished repairing the wards already?
Traveler: Not yet.
Kaji: It's fine. Take your time.
Kaji: And if you don't manage it, just leave it. The most important thing is that you shouldn't stay in this place too long â€” it's dangerous.
Traveler: I'm still working on it.

### Additional Talk 1

Observe: The strange stone lantern seems to emit an ominous energy.
Paimon: Is this... a stone lantern? Why is there a stone lantern here?
Paimon: Well, someone's written something on the lamp post. Shall we go have a look?
Observe: "Fellow workers, if you have any questions about this ward, please go to the Musoujin Gorge and talk to Mr. Kaji."
Observe: The handwriting looks new. There are a few small rough lines of writing below:
Observe: "I'm sorry, but we can't help you either. We just received evacuation orders from the commissioner yesterday.
Observe: "I hope I can see you again someday and discuss how to solve our Tatarigami problem."
Paimon: This Mr. Kaji seems to be pretty concerned about these stone lanterns. Why don't we go to Musoujin Gorge and ask him?

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: Something seems to be missing from this ward. Let's try to find it with Elemental Sight, shall we?

### Additional Talk 3
