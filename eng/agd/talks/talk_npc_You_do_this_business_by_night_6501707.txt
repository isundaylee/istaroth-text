Traveler: You do this business by night?
Potier: Of course! Don't people usually realize that they've forgotten to bring their keys only upon returning home at night?

Potier: Don't worry, don't worry. I have principles and sense — and more importantly, I don't want to perform a "trial-standing show" at the opera house.
