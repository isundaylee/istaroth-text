Kagawa: Well... Come to think of it, I did see some purple crystals while training around these parts.
Kagawa: That said, I don't do any metalworking, so they're of little use to me. I think they were around here... There we go, I've marked it out on your map.
Kagawa: Remember to enjoy the scenery while you're on the way there!

Kagawa: Well... Come to think of it, I did see some rare Magical Crystal Ore while training around these parts. They say that the quality of these is a fair shade superior to those of ordinary ore.

Traveler: Is there anything I should take note of nearby?

### Talk 2 related talk 1

Traveler: Training?
Kagawa: That's right. I believe that people need to go out and train more while they're young. Only by absorbing the essence of both the sun and moon can one really train one's body and soul.
Kagawa: You see, the blooming of flowers mark the changing of the seasons, and the flow of this waterfall marks the flow of time.
Kagawa: We all live in nature, and we should appreciate its beauty rather than bury our heads in work all the time...
Kagawa: Wait, uh, I mean, you can only work at your best after you've trained yourself, am I right?

Traveler: Goodbye.
Kagawa: Farewell. Remember to smell the flowers and take in the sights as you travel.

Traveler: That's a pretty good point.
Kagawa: Exactly! I met a young samurai with a streak of red in his hair, and he said so too.
Kagawa: ...I'm not sure if this was the precise meaning of his words, but it's a sure bet that he's a nature-lover, just like me.
Kagawa: Not to mention that his abilities were way above mine, too! He could apparently tell what the weather would be just from the movement of the wind and grass. He must have reached the apex of training, I'm sure of it!
Kagawa: Ah, nature is so lovely. I, too, must train harder.
