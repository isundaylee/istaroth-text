Traveler: New tableware?
Lambad: Yep, there was some small accident in the tavern a few days ago, so the original tableware can't be used anymore.
Lambad: It turned out to be a blessing in disguise. The tableware we have now is made by craftspeople commissioned by Kshah{RUBY#[S]Technology}rewar researchers, with the patterns designed by Hara{RUBY#[S]Semiotics}vatat researchers.
Lambad: There is no other establishment in Sumeru City with such a luxurious setup.
Lambad: So you see, little accidents in life aren't necessarily all bad, hahaha!
