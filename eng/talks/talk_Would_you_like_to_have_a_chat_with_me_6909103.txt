# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Navia: Sure thing! I mean, that's the whole point of coming here to hang out.
Navia: Hmm... So, what's new with you? Anything in particular on your mind lately?
Traveler: Hats. Can we talk hats for a second?
Navia: Ah yes. We certainly can. You know, you should consider getting yourself a hat.
Navia: And I don't mean a hat to keep your ears warm or your head dry... I just think your hairstyle would look really neat with a hat!
Traveler: Well then, maybe we should go clothes-shopping together sometime.
Navia: Oh, sure! I'll take you to the best shop in all of Fontaine. Let me think... Yeah, you and Paimon could both do with fancy outfits for formal occasions, as well as a hat and a new pair of leather shoes...
Navia: Actually, come to think of it — how have you dressed for formal occasions in the past?
Traveler: We pretty much just wear the same thing all the time.
Navia: Really? Huh, that's a surprise... That's cool though. I like how you don't get hung up about that kind of thing.
Navia: I often find that people who don't stress about their appearance are the most chilled-out.
Navia: Whatever the world throws at them, they just take it as it comes — no nonsense, no pretensions. Honestly, I think that's pretty awesome.
Navia: I guess traveling the world instills that kind of confidence in you, huh? ...But still, let's definitely get you a nice hat and some leather shoes when we have the chance!
