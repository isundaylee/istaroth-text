# Mysterious Islands: Journey to the Unknown


## Talk 1

Paimon: #Come to think of it, Traveler, we haven't seen Klee for a while, have we?
Paimon: Let's go find her! She'll probably be happy to see us, too!
Paimon: But where would she be at this time of day?
Paimon: We might as well check with the *Knights*!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Let's walk around the city and ask people who might know something about the situation.

## Talk 3

Paimon: It's time! Let's meet up with Barbara and Klee at the plaza!

## Talk 4

Paimon: The surrounding fog seems to have lifted! Lighting these devices is really useful.

## Talk 5

Paimon: The surrounding area is gradually becoming clearer. Let's go and find the last one!

## Talk 6

Paimon: We've found all the devices! Let's go *someplace higher up* to get a view of our surroundings.

## Talk 7

Paimon: We're all here now!
Barbara: Everyone, over here.
Klee: #{F#Miss}{M#Mr.} Honorary Knight, Paimon~
Jean: Greetings.
Traveler: Oh, Master Jean is also here.
Jean: Yes, it's a long story...
Jean: Barbara and Lisa have both spoken to me, and there is something that I have realized. Regardless if I approve it or not, Klee will go where she wants to anyway. This is how it has always been.
Klee: Ehehe...
Barbara: We all know Klee. Rather than have her run headlong into danger, it's better to agree to her request.
Jean: Knight Klee, your request for leave has been approved.
Klee: Wow! I'm so excited!
Barbara: However, there are conditions!
Jean: In exchange, I will be accompanying everyone to this letter's Golden Apple Archipelago. As for the Knights' affairs, I have entrusted them to Kaeya.
Jean: Work has been busy and I shouldn't leave, but... I wouldn't be able to stop worrying about Klee.
Jean: So, please allow me to travel with you.
Paimon: Alright! There won't be any problems if Master Jean comes with us!
Barbara: Big Sis— I mean, Master Jean also suggested that I come along. Barbatos forbid, but I can assist if someone needs medical treatment during our journey.
Paimon: We're so lucky to have Barbara too!
Klee: Miss Barbara, Master Jean, you two are so nice. I promise I'll behave!
Jean: Klee, you always say that. I hope you will abide by your words this time.
Klee: Hehe...
Jean: Lisa heard that I wanted to accompany everyone to the islands, so she prepared this pouch. Supposedly, opening it will reveal a new way.
Paimon: New way? You mean a way to keep Klee out of trouble?
Jean: She said not to open it until we've reached the islands. I think it might be something to use in case of an emergency.
Barbara: As expected of Miss Lisa! She's been thinking of us this whole time.
Barbara: Anyway, our next step is to find the bard, right? I just asked the people nearby. They said that he hasn't performed at the square today and that he likely went to Windrise.
Paimon: What are we waiting for? Let's head to *Windrise* and find Tone-Deaf Bard.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Venti! We found you!
Venti: Hm? If so many people are looking for me, then I suppose it is something important?
Traveler: Venti, do you know of the Golden Apple Archipelago?
Paimon: This is the map of the islands.
Venti: Oh, yes, that place... Hahaha, congratulations, you've found the right person.
Klee: Wowowooow, you really do know!
Venti: So now they're called the Golden Apple Archipelago, huh? They used to be known as the Haar Islands. They're located on a stretch of sea that's particularly difficult for the average person to reach.
Venti: Not to mention, the area has strong storms and thick fog year-round. Ships can hardly approach the islands, let alone dock.
Venti: Why do you guys wish to go there?
Klee: I'm going there to meet Dodo-King! He said he wants to test Klee to see if she's qualified to be Dodoco's family!
Venti: Hmm. Are you nervous?
Klee: A little... But I will not give in. Master Tone-Deaf Bard, you must help us!
Venti: Master Tone-Deaf Bard... Interesting. I like it.
Traveler: Paimon, you're a bad influence...
Paimon: Is this Paimon's fault?
Venti: Fear not! Since you wish it so, Master Tone-Deaf Bard will lend a helping hand.
Jean: Could you really help us?
Venti: Of course! In this world, what is more pure and free than the wish of a child?
Barbara: What a beautiful sound...
Paimon: Huh? Is the wind picking up?
Venti: Wait just a moment, he'll be here soon.
Jean: Th—That's...!?
Venti: Uh—uhh...
Venti: This is a secret between us here, so don't tell anyone else.
Barbara: One of the Four Winds!?
Jean: Oh! My dear poet, you have my utmost gratitude for the aid you have provided us.
Venti: The Acting Grand Master sure is formal.
Traveler: We knew you'd have a way, Venti.
Venti: Haha, what wonderful expressions you all have!
Venti: I'll see you off here. May the winds bless your travels~!
Traveler: Way to go!

## Talk 9

Dvalin: This is as far as I go.
Dvalin: It would be cumbersome for me to proceed further. Please exercise caution.
Traveler: ...?
Klee: We're here, we finally made it!
Paimon: Tone-Deaf Bard sure knows when to pull out all the stops, suddenly letting us ride over on a dragon! Paimon almost got blown away...
Barbara: Th—That was my first time riding on a dragon's back. M—My heart won't stop pounding...
Jean: Phew... Is everyone alright?
Barbara: Yes, I'm fine. Big Sis— uh Master Jean, just who is that bard?
Jean: Well, uh...
Jean: He's a legendary bard of exceptional musical talent who can use his lyre to call forth all manner of creatures.
Paimon: Whoa, even Master Jean is pretty quick on the spot...
Traveler: A necessary skill for managing subordinates.
Barbara: Wow, what an impressive person. We must properly thank him when we return.
Jean: Agreed. In any case, what are these islands?
Jean: The weather is dreadful, the fog is thick, and visibility is low. Just like Lisa said.
Paimon: We should be extra careful.
Jean: Traveler, Paimon, what else does the letter say?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon remembers! It read, "Wicked girl of flame, I am of the Dodo Clan as its overlord. In the name of Dodo-King, you are not qualified to become Dodoco's new family!"
Traveler: Unless...
Paimon: "Unless you bring Dodoco to the Golden Apple Archipelago, light the four beacons, and knock upon the trialist's gate to accept your challenge."
Barbara: Four beacons? Does that mean he wants us to find something that emits light?
Paimon: Now that you mention it, doesn't it seem like it's a little less foggy here than the surrounding area?
Jean: Looking carefully, that indeed appears to be the case.
Jean: Could the clearing of the fog be related to this device?
Paimon: #Don't you think it looks familiar, Traveler? Pretty similar to the Portable Waypoints we've used before.
Paimon: Crafting Portable Waypoints requires Luminescent Spines, so they can also function as a source of light. So if this device here seems like it can dissipate fog, maybe it's a similar kind of device.
Traveler: I think so, too.
Barbara: "Light four beacons, and knock upon the trialist's gate"... What will happen after we light up all four beacons?
Jean: There's already one lit device here. It appears that we need to find the other three and light them up as well.
Klee: Huh? What's that?
Paimon: #Hey, don't run off... Agh, c'mon, Traveler, catch up to her!
Klee: It looks like something's *down there*!
Jean: Let's take a closer look.

## Talk 10

Paimon: Looks like the people of Mondstadt don't know anything about the place in this letter.
Traveler: Feels more and more like a prank to me.
Paimon: Klee, is there anyone you can think of that you don't get along with? Would there be anyone who'd write a letter to scare you?
Klee: No, I love everyone very much, and everyone loves Klee very much.
Paimon: Mm, Paimon thinks so, too.
Klee: So it can't be a prank!
Traveler: Agreed.
Paimon: Hmm, it's not a prank, yet no one knows where these islands are. Ugh, this is getting more and more confusing.
Traveler: Is there someone even more knowledgeable we could ask?
Paimon: Knowledgeable... Right!
Paimon: We should ask Lisa about this kind of thing! She's at the library every day and has probably read every book in Mondstadt.
Klee: Oh! Miss Lisa!
Paimon: Let's go to the *library*!
Traveler: No one would prank Klee.

## Talk 11

Paimon: ...A boat?
Jean: It looks as if someone has been awaiting our arrival.
Paimon: Are we really supposed to sail in such terrible weather?
Jean: I'm afraid that appears to be the intention. Everyone... Everything about these islands is a mystery. Regardless of what lies ahead, please proceed with utmost caution.

## Talk 12

Paimon: Discuss Findings

## Talk 13

Kaeya: Who would've thought that the Acting Grand Master would ever step out of her office?
Kaeya: Oh my, looks like I'll be quite busy in the near future... but there's no helping that.

## Talk 14

Klee: The fog's gone!
Paimon: Huh, it's actually pretty scenic here.
Jean: The four beacons have been lit, but we still don't know what trials may lie ahead.
Barbara: Ahh, the weather's so nice!
Barbara: I know we can't afford to drop our guard, but I can't help but enjoy the summer...
Klee: I wanna catch fish!
Jean: Klee, this isn't Mondstadt. Please be careful.
Klee: Oh. I understand...
Klee: Paimon, after we deal with Dodo-King together, we can go catch some fish!
Paimon: Okay, sure, whatever you say!
Jean: Who or what exactly is Dodo-King?
Traveler: You seem concerned.
Jean: Yes. It is also my first time here. This may not sound fair to Klee, but my primary duty is to protect everyone. Finding this overlord is secondary.
Jean: Also, the sudden appearance of this letter, these islands that are inaccessible by ordinary people... It's too much of a coincidence. Why would this sort of invitation be sent to a child?
Barbara: It's truly unbelievable... I also mustn't be careless.
Paimon: Well, what are we all waiting for? Let's start exploring the area!
Traveler: Carefree and ready to explore, classic Paimon.
Jean: Paimon's right. We should take advantage of the clear weather to reassess our situation.
Barbara: Even on a mysterious island, I have no worries as long as you're here.
Barbara: Whew! So, should we go swimming first?
Jean: *sigh* Barbara is always happy-go-lucky when she sees such beautiful scenery.
Jean: Traveler, please feel free to explore. I'll be at the ready if there is any sign of danger.
Jean: I hope this island doesn't give us too much trouble...
