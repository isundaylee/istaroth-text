Traveler: Is there something wrong with performances?
Vimeur: Not that, per se. I'm just not all that interested in operas, plays, or magic, and the like.
Vimeur: Speaking of which, I was only sent here because when asked "Do you like theater?" I answered "No."
Vimeur: I suppose they don't want Gardes posted here to be distracted by performances or trials. We do need to focus on work, after all.
Vimeur: They've made big changes in how they publicize the performances and trials as if they're trying to differentiate more between them. That's a good thing, for me at least.
