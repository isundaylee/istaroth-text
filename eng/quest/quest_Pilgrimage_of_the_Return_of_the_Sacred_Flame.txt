# Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame


## Talk 1

Kachina: #Morning, {NICKNAME}! Morning, Paimon!
Mualani: Looks like everyone's here right on time, hehe. Good to see that no one overslept!
Ajaw: Says the one who only made it because I was there to get you!
Kachina: Ajaw, not so loud. You're gonna give me a headache...
Mualani: Well, if you don't do well today, we know who to blame, now don't we?
Ajaw: See how your friends talk to me, Kinich? I help you wake them up, make sure everyone's on time, and do I get a "thank you, Ajaw"? No! I get told off!
Kinich: Mualani's right, though.
Ajaw: ...*sigh* Hopeless, every last one of you.
Paimon: Alright, moving on... How did you sleep last night, Kachina?
Kachina: I had some nerves at first, but my bed was great — I fell asleep the minute my head hit the pillow.
Paimon: That's good to hear! Maybe you handle stress better than you know!
Kinich: The competition's about to start. Did everyone eat something?
Kachina: A little. Didn't wanna overdo it.
Paimon: Oh no, we were so busy focusing on the tournament, we forgot to buy something!
Mualani: I thought that might happen. Here, I brought you some.
Traveler: Thanks.
Mualani: No thanks necessary! I'll treat you to something even better once—
Tonina: Attention, everyone. The tournament is about to begin. All contestants proceed to the venue. I repeat, all contestants proceed to the venue.
Mualani: Well, I'd say more, but that's our cue.
Mualani: The opening ceremony is what kicks everything off... You should be able to see Kachina and me from the stands. We're counting on you to cheer us on!
Paimon: Don't you worry! Paimon's gonna cheer so loud, you'll hear it across the stadium!
Kachina: Thanks, you two. I'll be sure to keep an ear out.
Mualani: Well, we should get going. See you later!
Paimon: Okay, bye-bye!
Lamanai: Attention, everyone. The tournament is about to begin. All spectators, please take your seats. I repeat, all spectators, please take your seats.
Paimon: Oh, that's our cue!
Paimon: Wow, we've definitely never witnessed a competition of this scale before! Let's go in once you're ready.

## Talk 2

Lamanai: Entering the Stadium of the Sacred Flame? You won't be able to leave the arena once the tournament begins.

## Talk 3

Xpuhil: Our team captain talked a big game before the match, and well... Was that a quick knockout, or what?
Xpuhil: Should keep a better lookout next time I sign up...

## Talk 4

Balam: The Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame is a competition with a long, storied history. Countless hopefuls have gathered here today, each vying for the same prize — the right to serve their homeland in the Night Warden Wars.
Balam: Before we begin, allow me to remind everyone of the rules. Today's tournament begins with the team stage, before advancing into individual competition.
Balam: Each team will board a hot-air balloon, which will land at a random location.
Balam: Contestants must search for Fire Towers within the contest grounds, accumulate Contending Fire through combat, and bring a sufficient amount back to the Stadium.
Balam: Defeat in combat, departure from the contest grounds, and running out of time all lead to elimination! Only the strongest teams will be able to withstand the onslaught of battle and return to the arena, blazing Fire in hand.
Balam: Only those who emerge triumphant in the team stage earn the right to take part in the individual battles. The outcome of these one-on-one matches not only affects the contestants' individual scores but also determines their next opponent.
Balam: After many rounds of battle, the contestants with the top five rankings will get the chance to take part in the Night Warden Wars!
Balam: Now, let us welcome our Archon as she delivers the opening address!
Mavuika: Skill, strategy, fortune, form... Many factors influence strength, but victory never lies.
Mavuika: The Pilgrimage is not merely a trial to determine the strongest among us, but also a stage upon which to showcase your individual growth.
Mavuika: Today marks the beginning of yet another legendary saga — one written in the triumphs of the victors! So, without further ado... Let the games begin!
Paimon: So, that's the Pyro Archon!? Is it just Paimon, or does she seem kinda intimidating...?
Paimon: Kachina said she was "friendly and welcoming," but, uh... how did she come to that conclusion?
Traveler: She does seem pretty imposing.
Paimon: Didn't Kachina say she was just an ordinary person before becoming the Archon? Sure doesn't seem like it...
Paimon: She doesn't seem ordinary at all... Ooh, look, it's Kachina and the others!
Balam: Well, folks, it's clear the contestants are already raring to go! The teams will now board their hot-air balloons and make their way to the competition grounds.
Mersa: Chasca! Chasca!
Zacatula: Go, Chasca! You can do it!
Teayo: Kick their butts, Itzna!
Sausa: Go, Mualani! Go!
Paimon: You can do it, Kachina!
Balam: And the crowd goes wiiild! The hot-air balloons are about to ascend — contestants, prepare yourselves to take flight!
Balam: Remember the rules! The balloons will take you to random locations, and your battle starts the moment you land. Best your competition, collect Sacred Fire, and bring it back to the Stadium.
Balam: Good luck, everyone!
Traveler: I want to talk to her.
Paimon: Yeah, but it would be kinda rude to bother her during the Pilgrimage, don't you think?
Paimon: We should wait for a better time... Ooh, look! It's Kachina and the others!

## Talk 5

Kachina: Guess this is where we're starting.
Mualani: Let me see... Seems pretty quiet around here. Looks like we get to ease ourselves into combat today.
Mualani: Let's head that way. We don't need to worry about avoiding other teams. Anyone that crosses our path can kiss their chances goodbye!
Kachina: Okay. I'll follow your lead.
Mualani: Just remember — don't hesitate. The team matches are all about keeping the energy up, so let's do it!

## Talk 6

Traveler: (Enter the stands)

## Talk 7

Traveler: (There's something I need to do first...)

## Talk 8

Paimon: Have faith in yourself, Kachina — and don't get too tense!

## Talk 9

Paimon: Have faith in yourself, Kachina — and don't get too tense!

## Talk 10

Nkunga: You must be Kachina?
Nkunga: You know, people told me I got lucky in the draw, but I beg to differ. There are no coincidences in the arena. If you're standing here, it means you're strong, no matter what anyone says.
Nkunga: So, I'm looking forward to seeing what you're made of. The team stage ended before I had my fill of battle. I hope you don't disappoint.
Nkunga: Well, anything you want to say in return?
Kachina: I—I won't lose to you, not when so many people are supporting me, and cheering for me, and I—
Kachina: I really want to earn a spot in the Night Warden Wars!
Balam: Alright, our contestants have each said their piece. To your places, everyone. Aaand... Begin!

## Talk 11

Tonina: Congratulations, Mualani! Congratulations, Kachina! You've successfully cleared the team stage!
Mersa: Amazing! Congratulations!
Taenga: Congratulations!
Sausa: Keep it up, Mualani!
Zacatula: Kachina! Mualani!
Paimon: Kachina! Mualani!
Traveler: Kachina! Mualani!
Lamanai: You two can take a short break while the team stage comes to a close. We'll draw names to determine the individual match-ups in a moment.
Lamanai: After that, we'll proceed to the next stage of the competition. I wish you both the best.
Tonina: You two are assigned to different lounge areas. If you'll follow me, please, Kachina.
Kachina: Solo battles next, and I was three wins short last time. I've got to do better.
Kachina: Phew... Just calm down, Kachina. You're in good form. You can do this...
Tonina: Hold it right there. This is the contestants' lounge. Unauthorized access is prohibited.
Tepexpan: We're contestants, too! Let us through!
Tonina: According to my list, you're not among the individual match contenders, nor are you related to any of the remaining candidates.
Tepexpan: Well, we'd still be candidates if it was just based on strength! We only lost because two other contestants snuck up on us like cowards! If you could just go contact the referee, we'll wait right here for you to—
Tamuin: Ah...
Kachina: Wait, you two are...
Tepexpan: Well, look who we have here. Remember us? Your little trick got us disqualified!
Tamuin: Since we've crossed paths again, let's settle this once and for all. We'll see who truly deserves to advance to the next stage... Fight us.
Kachina: Right now?
Tonina: Don't mind him, Kachina. Tournament rules place you under no obligation to honor that request — a loss is a loss, and that's final.
Tonina: You! Don't just stand there! Get security over here, now!
Tepexpan: Forget the rules! Isn't the Pilgrimage about picking the strongest warriors? She just happened to catch us off-guard. It was all luck!
Tamuin: Exactly. Now's our chance to duke it out fair and square—
Paimon: Kachina!
Traveler: ...
Tepexpan: Who are you?
Kachina: #{NICKNAME}! Paimon! What are you doing here?
Paimon: We just came to have a chat, and then all of a sudden, these guys were threatening you!
Paimon: Hmph. You're not bullying Kachina on our watch!
Kachina: Th—Thanks, you guys.
Kachina: I don't know your names... But, if you really want to face me, I'll allow it.
Kachina: It has to wait until after the tournament, though! I need to focus on the upcoming matches. I don't want to let my parents down, or any of the friends who helped me get this far.
Tonina: That's enough, you two. "Being caught off-guard" is not an excuse. You think you can cry foul play when you face the Abyss?
Tonina: If this behavior persists, you may find yourselves barred from future competition.
Tamuin: Tch... Whatever. Let's go.
Paimon: Are you alright? You're not hurt anywhere, are you?
Kachina: No, thanks to you. To be honest, I totally blanked out just now. I had no idea what to do.
Traveler: It's alright. Just relax.
Kachina: Right! I—I'll show them what I'm made of!
Paimon: That sounds more like it! You can do it!
Lamanai: I heard there was trouble... Has the situation been resolved?
Tonina: Yes. It was nothing out of the ordinary — a couple of sore losers coming to stir up trouble with the contestants.
Lamanai: *sigh* Some people are so obsessed with glory, they can't even bear the idea of failure.
Lamanai: I hope you don't let them get to you, Kachina, because you'll need to get ready. Your match is up soon.
Kachina: That came up quick... Alright, I'm coming!
Kachina: Hehe, w—well, guess I'm off!
Traveler: Focus on your upcoming matches.
Traveler: I'm happy to oblige...

## Talk 12

Paimon: Cheerleaders One and Two are here for you, no matter what!

## Talk 13

Lamanai: We issued a warning to those two troublemakers. Try not to let them get to you.
Lamanai: We get people like that every year. The Pilgrimage symbolizes glory, and some people can't accept missing out on the chance to claim it.

Tournament Bulletin Board: (The final round is about to begin...)
Kachina: Mualani...

## Talk 16

Kachina: Hah!
Liliuo: Ugh!
Liliuo: Gotta hand it to you, kid, you really impressed me. I take back what I said before our match.
Liliuo: You've got what it takes, Kachina. Youngsters like you? You'll forge your own miracles.
Balam: And it's Kachina for the win! We'll now head into a short break as our contestants prepare for the final round of competition!
Kachina: Thanks for cheering me on, you two.
Paimon: You were great out there! You faced a lot of impressive competitors, but they never stood a chance!
Kachina: I don't think I did too shabby, either. I've never gotten this many points before...
Mualani: Ready for the last round, Kachina?
Paimon: Mualani!
Mualani: I got permission to come see you before the last round starts. Based on your score, it looks like you'll make it to the Night Warden Wars if you win your next match.
Mualani: But, uh, your final opponent... It's me.
Paimon: What!?
Traveler: How unfortunate...
Kachina: Yeah, I just found out myself. We're really close in the rankings, so... Only the winner gets to move forward.
Kachina: But, I... I wanted to fight alongside you.
Mualani: I did, too, but it is what it is. People with similar scores tend to get matched against each other.
Mualani: But, we just have to get past it! War is cruel, and the Abyss certainly isn't going to go easy on us. Only Natlan's strongest deserve to stand against them.
Mualani: So, I'm going to give this battle my all, Kachina, and I hope you do the same.
Mualani: To hand victory to your opponent is to take pity on them. But, no one's asking for pity, here, yeah? So, you ready?
Kachina: I—I'll do my best!
Mualani: Attagirl.
Paimon: So, if one of you has to lose... Who should we cheer for, then?
Mualani: Hahaha, you mean one of us is destined to win! It's something worth celebrating either way!
Mualani: I'll be happy no matter who wins, and I know you feel the same way, Kachina. So don't overthink it — let's just have ourselves a good match.
Mualani: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon — I'll see you after the match. Kachina — I'll see you on the field.
Traveler: Kachina...
Traveler: Good luck.
Kachina: I've been training so long for this, and Mualani's helped so much. I'm going to show her that it didn't go to waste.
Kachina: Thanks for believing in me. I'll... try believing in myself this time, too.

## Talk 17

Nkunga: *cough* I actually lost... Hah, knew I had an eye for the good ones. Guess that means I was right about you all along...
Balam: Congratulations to Kachina for taking the win! Let's give her a round of applause, everyone! Now, diving into the other match-ups...
Paimon: That's one down, woohoo!
Black Screen Text: The rounds continue. Kachina scores some wins and suffers some losses. Her ranking stays in the middle of the pack.
Black Screen Text: The individual match-ups reach the halfway mark. It's Kachina's turn to take the field again.
Liliuo: Where'd you come from, kid? Think you've got what it takes to go to war?
Liliuo: Hate to break it to you, but it won't be easy to get through me.
Kachina: And you are...?
Liliuo: You don't recognize me? Hah, figures. Our generation's been in decline ever since Atea and the others retired from the frontlines.
Liliuo: Either way, once we face off, you won't forget my name any time soon. Let's do this!

## Talk 18

Kibangu: Hear me out, you two. There's no Fire Tower around here, so there's no need for us to fight it out.
Kibangu: We can see who comes out on top the next time we run into each other. But, for now, I say we focus on preserving our strength. What do you think?

## Talk 19

Balam: And with that, the winners of this Pilgrimage have been decided!
Balam: Put your hands together for our victors as we welcome them to the stage—
Balam: With her sixth consecutive win... Chasca of the Flower-Feather Clan!
Balam: She managed to turn the tides all by herself... Iansan of the Collective of Plenty!
Balam: With an explosive comeback ten years in the making... Kaiulani of the People of the Springs!
Balam: A seasoned and renowned warrior... Kibangu of the Scions of the Canopy.
Balam: Last but not least... Finally living up to her true potential... Kachina of the Children of Echoes!
Paimon: Woo! Over here, Kachina!
Kachina: I... I made it...
Kachina: Feels like a dream.
Chasca: This is no dream. Your strength is what got you here.
Iansan: We'll be going to war together. It's an honor to fight alongside you, Kachina.
Mavuika: No matter how many Pilgrimages I witness, I'm always overwhelmed with pride in this moment.
Mavuika: Pride for you, my brave warriors. You give me faith that our innumerable sacrifices are not in vain, that the future of Natlan shall burn with the brilliance of a blazing fire!
Mavuika: Brave warriors, the following is an order, and also a personal request — go forth and crush the Abyss. Seize victory and glory for Natlan!
Iansan: As you command!
Kachina: A—As you command!
Black Screen Text: As the crowd erupts in cheers, the Pilgrimage draws to a close.
Mualani: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon! There you are!
Mualani: I wanted to thank you for supporting Kachina back there. She really has grown into a formidable competitor. She deserved that win.
Mualani: Not that it feels good to lose, but I'm happy for her... *sigh* Definitely bittersweet, though.
Mualani: Hey, wanna go for a walk? Kachina and the others will be busy fighting the Abyss, so why don't I show you around Natlan for a while?
Paimon: #Sure. What do you say, {NICKNAME}?
Paimon: Uh, something on your mind?
Traveler: I'm a little worried about Kachina.
Mualani: Listen, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried. But, she's got experienced, powerful companions to take the lead. I'm sure they'll be fine.
Mualani: Glory always comes with a risk. If victory was assured, no one would take pride in it.
Mualani: She's not one to fall so easily. She bears the Ancient Name, "Utha{RUBY#[D]Resilience}biti," after all. We just need to hold the fort while they're gone...
Mualani: Come to think of it, you've never visited my tribe, have you? Come on, I'll take you.
Mualani: The People of the Springs live alongside the Koholasaurs. Our tribe is an ideal spot for some R & R! I'll take you to all the best spots. You'll love it!
Kinich: ...Looks like you beat me to it.
Paimon: Kinich?
Kinich: I was planning on inviting you to visit the Scions of the Canopy. Most of the Adventurers that belong to the Guild come from my tribe, so I figured you might be interested.
Mualani: Hey, first come, first served. You snooze you lose, Kinich.
Kinich: #Yeah, yeah. You were first. Still, {NICKNAME}, Paimon, feel free to stop by if you ever have time. You're always welcome.
Traveler: Thank you very much.
Paimon: Yeah! Thanks for inviting us!
Mualani: Alright! Let's pack up and head out!
Traveler: We'll be there.
Traveler: This is her first time fighting in the Night Warden Wars, right?

## Talk 20

Tonina: A competition is no place for regrets. Leave it all on the field. I have faith in you.
