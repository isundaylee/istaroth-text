# Talk Dialog

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Chongyun: Hmm. If you ask me, it would be a nice place to settle down in.
Chongyun: This realm isn't as cool as the snowy mountains, but I don't need to worry about being scorched by the sun or sudden temperature changes.
Chongyun: I can concentrate on training since there's no need to worry about the effects of my yang energy.
Traveler: Not going to go outside and walk around?
Chongyun: If I do, I have to carry a parasol around and keep an eye on the sun.
Chongyun: Anyway, thank you for inviting me to such a cozy place...
Chongyun: If you need anything from me, I'll help out.
Traveler: Looks like I won't have to worry about evil spirits in here.
Chongyun: Naturally. I can assure you of that.
