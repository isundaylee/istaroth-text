# Butter Chicken

A flavorful dish. Spice and chopped tomatoes were mixed with warm butter, and then cooked into a creamy sauce. Into it went marinated and pan-fried chicken pieces. People from Sumeru prefer eating the dish with rice or flatbread, which allows them to savor the dish's enticing flavor better.
