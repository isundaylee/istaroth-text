Traveler: Hello. What is this place?
Caramuru: This is an Obsidian Totem Pole. Pretty awesome, huh? They say you can directly connect to the Wayob here!
Caramuru: It's just that sorta sacred relic... although the details escape me. Haha, that's what you get when you've never been good at history.
Caramuru: If there's anything more you'd like to know, feel free to consult the person on the night shift!
Caramuru: Whatever the case, so long as you're willing to help us People of the Springs a little, the Totem Pole won't do you dirty.
