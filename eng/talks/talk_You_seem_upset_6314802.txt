Traveler: You seem upset.
Mochizuki: Yes, and you want to know why? It's because there's this researcher from Sumeru running around spreading false histories!
Mochizuki: I don't know what school of reasoning he's from, but whatever it is, he's just spinning out fantasies and distortions!
Mochizuki: He doesn't seem all that fond of verifying anything, but oh, he's very fascinated with non-existent hypotheses and stories, that's for sure! He's giving me a real headache...
Mochizuki: I only hope that people aren't taken in by his words and forget Sangonomiya Shrine's real history...
