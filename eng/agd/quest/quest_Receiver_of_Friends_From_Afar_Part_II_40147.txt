# Receiver of Friends From Afar: Part II


## Talk 1

Smiley Yanxiao: #Morning, Traveler! The boss tells me that both new and returning customers have nothing but good things to say about you!
Smiley Yanxiao: I have to admit, I was a little worried about throwing you right into the deep end. But it looks like you've got what it takes to handle the day-to-day here.
Smiley Yanxiao: So, it should be plain sailing. Well, just as long as we don't run into any extremely picky customers with unreasonably specific requests.
Paimon: Whoa... Have you had someone like that before?
Smiley Yanxiao: Of course. The worst are those old scholars who have barely cooked a day in their life, but think reading a stack of books on the topic makes them the expert...
Smiley Yanxiao: They criticize you for no reason, claiming your cooking method isn't faithful to the original, or that the flavor profile isn't authentic because you used an ingredient that wasn't in their beloved centuries-old version of the recipe...
Faruzan (???): This is Wangshu Inn? Hm, it does have the look and feel of a time-honored establishment...
Traveler: I know that voice...
Faruzan: Oh, Innkeeper! We'll have each of your signature dishes, please, as fast as you can serve them! The most expensive ones.
Paimon: Faruzan! Oops, uh, Madam Faruzan! Heh...
Faruzan: #Oh my! Traveler, Paimon? Whatever are you doing here?
Paimon: We could ask you the same thing! Where'd you suddenly get the funds to go sightseeing? And to order the most expensive things on the menu...
Faruzan: Hah! I'm not here to sightsee. Exemplary scholars like myself are highly sought after by cruise operators in need of an On-Board Consultant as they travel the world...
Layla: Madam Faruzan... Please... Slow down. Phew... None of us slept last night — how come Madam Faruzan still has so much energy? If she's really over a hundred years old, I don't understand how she keeps going...
Dori: *panting*... It's all my fault... She's been like this ever since I told her I'd be paying the expenses...
Paimon: Layla! ...And Dori? Huh, never would've bet on this combination...
Traveler: Why don't you all take a seat and catch your breath...
Black Screen Text: You invite the three to sit, and explain that you're helping out at Wangshu Inn...
Faruzan: Temporary chef, huh? Wow. No rest for the wicked.
Faruzan: Well, if the chef here is trusting you to run his whole kitchen, then I've got no doubt we're in for some authentic Liyue specialties!
Paimon: So why are you all in Liyue again? Something about being an "on-board consultant"?
Dori: I got my hands on a new boat from Fontaine a while ago, equipped with cutting-edge navigation technology. If we manage to spread the word, it could have huge business potential!
Dori: Right now, we're doing some test runs. We sailed from Port Ormos to Ritou, then from Ritou to Liyue Harbor. Next, we're planning to go to Dornman Port...
Layla: Madam Faruzan and me were hired to fine-tune the compass and other equipment. We sailed around the Sea of Clouds all of last night to put the system through some stress testing...
Traveler: That sounds like illegal overtime...
Dori: O—Overtime for which they'll both be fairly compensated! They're both here willingly — the contract is crystal clear on that...
Paimon: You really cover all your bases, don't you? Let Paimon guess, paying the expenses is part of the compensation, isn't it? No wonder Madam Faruzan is going for all the most expensive dishes.
Faruzan: Haha, it's not every day someone tells you to "order whatever you like." Now first up, we'll have the—
Dori: Ahem! Faruzan— Uh, Madam Faruzan, that is, while I am more than happy to treat you both to the most expensive dishes on the menu, we must remember that "most expensive" does not always mean "best"!
Dori: I've heard that the most expensive dishes in Liyue are usually either seafood-based or take an exceptionally long time to prepare...
Dori: Now, I don't know about you two, but after so many days at sea, I don't think I can so much as look at another piece of seafood again for at least the foreseeable future.
Faruzan: Huh, that's actually a good point...
Dori: Not to mention that poor Layla here looks like she's about to faint from hunger!
Layla: Huh? That's not because of hunger...
Dori: ...Surely the wise and virtuous Madam Faruzan could not bear to watch her poor student sit here and waste away?
Faruzan: Oh, well of course I care about my students' wellbeing, but... why do I feel like I'm being tricked...
Dori: #So, let's not order anything that will take too long to prepare! Aside from that, and seafood, we'll take whatever other expensive dishes you have. Over to you, Traveler!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Food's ready! Please enjoy!
Faruzan: Oooh, smells delightful!
Dori: ...Oh, we meant to ask — have you two eaten breakfast yet? If not, why don't you join us at the table?
Paimon: Huh, did Dori just offer us a free meal? When did she become so generous...
Dori: Hehe, let's not forget that the biggest business deals are always settled over a meal! C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, sit down and join us. Everyone, dig in!
Dori: (This dish looks simple enough, and I did my research, so surely it can't cost all that much? Worst-case scenario, maybe ten thousand Mora...)
Faruzan: #(This dish had better be worth working overtime all night for... Well, Traveler, this is the moment of truth!)
Layla: (So tired... So sleepy... I just wanna eat up and get to bed...)
Black Screen Text: Everyone begins to eat, each harboring their private concerns...
Layla: Is this... fowl? Wait, no, the texture is more like Shroomboar...
Faruzan: There's a different flavor in every bite... And the discerning palate might detect a hint of something smoked, too. Quite marvelous... How is this made?
Traveler: The smokiness is from the ham. That was my addition.
Faruzan: Ham? But I don't see any ham anywhere... Ohh!
Paimon: Hehe, so you've noticed? Yep, every single strip is kneaded from several different kinds of meat! Paimon and Yanxiao put in a lot of effort to make it just right!
Layla: Uh... so I'm not an expert or anything, but don't different meats have different cooking times? How is everything in this dish cooked to perfection?
Paimon: #Well, Traveler, you see, um... that's a trade secret!
Traveler: It's just a matter of practice.
Faruzan: Wow, so this dish really is one of a kind... That makes the whole trip worth it. By the way, does this special dish have a name?
Paimon: Ah, Paimon forgot to mention that part! The dish is called "Trembling Strings and Rushing Reeds," alluding to the way that the different threads of meat are woven together, and also—
Faruzan: ...The complex layers of flavor, yes? Akin to the harmonies of a musical ensemble?
Faruzan: The name, if I'm not mistaken, is a Liyue idiom that evokes a vigorous orchestral performance featuring both stringed and wind instruments playing together... Mm, quite an apt name for this dish.
Paimon: Huh... How did you know all that?
Faruzan: Every student has to master at least twenty languages before they graduate. Wait... Is that not a requirement anymore?
Layla: HUH? That used to be a thing!?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon almost forgot that you're also from Haravatat...
Dori: So... Um... Anyway, how much does this dish cost...?
Paimon: Oh, don't worry, not too much! That'll be... thirty thousand Mora, please and thank you!
Dori: Th—Thirty thousand!? ...
Dori: #About that... Paimon, Traveler, I merely invited you to "join us at the table," did I not? I don't believe I committed to paying for you...?
Dori: So... perhaps we could split the bill accordingly?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon knew it was too good to be true!
Traveler: Thirty thousand Mora surely isn't an outrageous amount for the most magnanimous Lord Sangemah Bay.
Paimon: Yeah! As a famous merchant, you've got a reputation to uphold!
Dori: Ugh... But every single Mora matters, you know!
Dori: *sigh* Alright, alright... I'll just consider that the cost of learning about this dish.
Dori: ...Once I'm back in Sumeru, I'll be sure to find someone to help me recreate the dish. And then... and then... I'll make it all back!
Traveler: I'll talk to the Boss. We should be able to do a twenty-percent discount.
Paimon: Hey, there's no need to... Ah well, it was your hard work anyway. You can call the shots.
Dori: Twenty percent off of thirty thousand... Ugh, that's still a pretty hefty expense...
Traveler: I know some special cooking techniques.

## Talk 3

Smiley Yanxiao: We're off to a good start this morning. Keep up the good work — I'm counting on you!
Black Screen Text: You and Paimon work flat out till closing time, serving countless customers. Their tastes couldn't be more different, but the positive reviews also couldn't be more consistent.

## Talk 4

Smiley Yanxiao: So... expensive, but no seafood, and nothing that takes too long to cook... That rules out pretty much our entire menu! Do these people get a kick out of being impossible to please?
Paimon: Ugh, that Dori! Is she doing this on purpose?
Traveler: I'd bet Mora that she is.
Smiley Yanxiao: This isn't Liuli Pavilion or Xinyue Kiosk, this is Wangshu Inn. We don't stock up on rare and exotic ingredients — we only get them in if someone puts in a special reservation.
Smiley Yanxiao: Well, if we're stuck with regular ingredients and we're on a time limit, there's only one way to bump up the price... And that's by cooking a dish that uses the chef's expertise and creativity to the fullest.
Smiley Yanxiao: #Traveler, as it happens, I know a recipe for something called "Trembling Strings and Rushing Reeds." It can be whipped up quickly with what we already have in the kitchen. One plate usually goes for... thirty thousand Mora!
Paimon: Thirty thousand!? But if it's quick to make and isn't fancy, what exactly makes it so special?
Smiley Yanxiao: Quick doesn't have to mean "quick and easy." To perfect this dish, you need expert knifework and very precise control over the heat.
Smiley Yanxiao: You have to finely slice several different types of meat into fine threads, knead them together into strips, then gently stir-fry them in the pan. What you end up with is a whole variety of flavors that come through layer by layer.
Smiley Yanxiao: This dish is unique in offering a harmonious blend of multiple kinds of meat, all cooked to perfection, while still bursting with their own distinct flavors.
Smiley Yanxiao: Do it right, and you've got a culinary masterpiece in your hands. But if you botch it, it's just a bunch of meat thrown on a plate.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it now. So this dish gets its value not from the ingredients, but the chef's expertise!
Traveler: ...Do you think I'll be able to pull it off?
Smiley Yanxiao: Don't worry, I can take care of the kneading and other prep work for you. You just focus on bringing it all together.
Paimon: Believe in yourself, you can do this! And if you mess it up, Paimon will still be happy to eat it, hehe.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Smiley Yanxiao: Oil, salt, sauce, vinegar... Right, that's everything we need.

### Additional Talk 2

Huai'an: #Why, Traveler, this year's off to a good start, wouldn't you say?

### Additional Talk 3

Faruzan: Even though I didn't get to try Adeptus' Temptation or Bamboo Shoot Soup, this "Trembling Strings and Rushing Reeds" was still quite impressive. Thank you for making it.
Traveler: I never thought you'd take a job away from any ruins...
Faruzan: Well, about that... Even though new-fangled contraptions are hardly my cup of tea, Dori's offer was quite enticing...
Faruzan: She said that every time we stopped at a new harbor, I'd be free to go and pick out some ancient books at the market and bring them back to Sumeru.
Faruzan: Heh, I couldn't resist an offer like that, so I offered to join for the lowest possible pay to undercut all my Kshahrewar competitors.

### Additional Talk 4

Smiley Yanxiao: Legend has it that a master chef once made this dish from five different kinds of meat. It speaks to my lack of skill that I can only handle three...

### Additional Talk 5

Dori: No seafood and nothing that takes too long to cook. The rest is up to you, hehe!
Faruzan: Hmm... I had my eye on Adeptus' Temptation, Bamboo Shoot Soup, and Golden Shrimp Balls, but I suppose they'll have to wait for the next time. Ah, but that could be years from now...
Layla: #Aww, Madam Faruzan looks so deflated all of a sudden. Traveler, please still try to choose dishes on the expensive side, okay?

### Additional Talk 6

Dori: Now, how should I justify a high price tag for a dish without any fancy ingredients? Maybe start by giving it a fancy-sounding name...?
Traveler: By the way... That whole spiel about no seafood and not taking too long to cook...
Dori: Uh... Hehe... Heh. I should have known you'd see through me.
Dori: *sigh* Everyone was exhausted and seasick when I made the offer last night, so I figured they probably wouldn't be able to eat all that much today. Well, you saw how that turned out...
Dori: I tried placing some limitations on the order to keep costs under control, but you still found a way around my schemes! *sigh* That's what I get for not thoroughly researching the market beforehand.
Paimon: Hey, you're not even paying those two much of a salary! Just treat them fairly next time and don't be so stingy!
Traveler: You're one to talk, Paimon... You freeload whenever you get the chance!
Paimon: Well, yeah... But, that's why Paimon's qualified to talk about this!
Traveler: Be honest. You chose Wangshu Inn to try and save money, didn't you?

### Additional Talk 7

Layla: I feel so much better now that I've gotten some food in me... Delicious food really does wonders for one's spirits.
Traveler: I never thought you'd take on such strenuous work...
Layla: Haha... My adviser said that young people shouldn't stay cooped up in the Akademiya all the time. They told me that I should take the chance to get out and see the stars in other skies.
Layla: Hmm... Maybe I can think of it as my first internship experience? But it sure is exhausting... Whew... *yawn*
