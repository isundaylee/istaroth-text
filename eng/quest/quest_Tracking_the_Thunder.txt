# Tracking the Thunder

Muzhen: Traveler, you've returned!
Muzhen: I had a look at the crystals you brought back earlier. They seem rather... "young."
Muzhen: By that, I mean that they come from rather recent elemental crystallizations... To strike a comparison, this is but a slightly deeper footprint recently left in the snow.
Muzhen: So this time, I'd like you to look for footprints that are more "shallow"... and follow them to their source!
Muzhen: When I say "shallow footprints," I mean deposits of Electro elements that have condensed to a certain extent near the ground.
Muzhen: If we are able to obtain sufficient samples of that for comparison, we should be able to draw a general route map.
Paimon: Shallow and deep footprints... route maps... Paimon's got no idea what you're on about.
Traveler: It is rather complicated...
Muzhen: Well, maybe my analogy wasn't the best, but I think you'll figure it out just fine once you're there!
Muzhen: Well, guess that's all for the chit-chat. Time to get moving!
