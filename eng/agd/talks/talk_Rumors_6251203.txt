Traveler: Rumors?
Ding Jr.: Shhh! Don't let anyone else hear! I'm only telling you, alright!?
Ding Jr.: A kind Carp Adeptus awakened recently, saw the damage in Chenyu Vale, and stopped the Xuanwen Beasts from wreaking more havoc.
Ding Jr.: If that rumor's true, the quality of tea will return to normal soon, easy!
Ding Jr.: Maybe it'll even be better than before!
