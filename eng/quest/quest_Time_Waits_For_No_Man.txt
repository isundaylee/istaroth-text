# Time Waits For No Man


## Talk 1

Cyrus: A signboard blown away by the wind... Flowers blown away by the wind... A lost cat... *sigh* It is as I expected...

## Talk 2

Cyrus: Back so soon? Well then, I suppose nothing serious is happening...
Traveler: No, there's still a lot of monster activity.
Cyrus: What? There are still monsters wandering around, and in even greater numbers than before?
Cyrus: That's strange. Wasn't the large force that attacked Mondstadt defeated previously? Why are they still skulking about in the area?
Cyrus: Could they have some other plans? ...I must gather the adventurers and re-issue our commissions. We cannot take these monsters lightly.
Cyrus: Conducting careful investigations into the activities of monsters in the wild falls within the purview of the Adventurers' Guild. It's time to show everyone what we're made of!
Cyrus: Ah, yes. Please take these as thanks for you efforts.
