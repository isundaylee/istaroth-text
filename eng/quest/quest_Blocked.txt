# Blocked?


## Talk 1

Anthony: Help! Heeeeelp!

## Talk 2

Anthony: Whew. Thanks, Traveler...
Anthony: But there's this roadblock here. I can't get through.
Anthony: Haha... I would be able to sort this myself if the hilichurls hadn't just beaten the living daylights out of me. I'm aching all over!
Anthony: But at least these medicinal herbs I gathered for Anna are still in good condition.
Anthony: I'm sorry... I know this is asking a lot after what you've done for me already, but could you get rid of the roadblock for me?
Traveler: Sure.
Anthony: Thank you! I'm going to take a much-needed rest in the meantime...
Traveler: I'm on a tight schedule, sorry.
Anthony: But Anna is waiting for me at home... Please, I really need your help.

## Talk 3

Anthony: Now the way ahead is clear. Thanks, Traveler.
Anthony: Anna's illness never fully goes away. But since we don't have much money, I often come here and gather what medicinal herbs I can.
Anthony: I managed to get the herbs I was looking for, but then that bunch started attacking me out of nowhere. You got here just in time to save me.
Anthony: This is for you. I make tea for Anna with it all the time, it helps with her coughing.
Anthony: You seem like the outdoors type too. Make sure you look after yourself.
