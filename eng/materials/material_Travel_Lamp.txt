# Travel Lamp

A lamp that the boy often used when studying at night. The flame can be adjusted via a mechanism in the lamp, and this was perhaps quite magical to a child who had never seen such a lamp before. Every time he saw the light from this lamp, he will think of the old days when he played various hand shadow characters and animals. This lamp was left here as a gift. Maybe this is a way for him to let go of his burden and move on.
