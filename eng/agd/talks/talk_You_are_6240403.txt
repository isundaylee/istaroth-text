Traveler: You are...?
Pops Zhou: I am the owner of this tea booth. It's not a lucrative business, but you do get to hear a lot of stories.
Pops Zhou: Hehehe... Honestly, the thing I love most about running this booth is watching all the travelers come and go, and listening to all the stories they have to tell.
Traveler: Stories?
Pops Zhou: Look at me, traveler, I'm just an old bag of bones.
Pops Zhou: I've never had to weather any great storms in my life, it's been smooth sailing all the way through.
Pops Zhou: But when I got old, I started feeling as if I was missing out.
Pops Zhou: So I packed a few things and left Mt. Qingce behind...
Pops Zhou: Once I left Qingce Village, I decided that this was where I was going to set up a booth. I don't do anything here except chat to people; listen to their stories, tell them mine... And I'm thoroughly enjoying it!
