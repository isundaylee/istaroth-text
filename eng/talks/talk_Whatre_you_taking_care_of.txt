Traveler: What're you taking care of?
Big-Footed Dajiao: I carry bridal sedan chairs, and I've just been contracted to carry a new one, but I wanna get a sign for it so the Millelith won't stop us...
Big-Footed Dajiao: But as soon as I started to speak, I had this certification form thrown at me. I already got certified ages ago, I came here to get a sign...
Big-Footed Dajiao: Before I had even finished speaking, she took back the form and said I could go home and wait to be notified of the outcome of my application.
Big-Footed Dajiao: She didn't listen to me at all... *sigh*
