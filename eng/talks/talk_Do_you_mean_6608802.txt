Traveler: Do you mean...
Akeor: Ohh, I mean the wisdom of the ancients!
Akeor: I've dug up a lot of treasures ever since I partnered up with this young lady from Sumeru. We're finding more and more useful tools.
Akeor: Have you ever seen a storage device that can compress phlogiston with three times the usual efficiency? With it equipped, my Saurian can run as fast as the wind!
Akeor: We haven't yet figured out how it works, but man, it feels great to use. Miss Tahmures has said that we don't have to get to the bottom of everything â€” that sometimes, science will work just like magic.
Akeor: Still, at this rate, perhaps I'll even become strong enough to sign up for the Pilgrimage...
Akeor: Ah well, the contract still takes priority, so I'd better finish the tasks that Miss Tahmures gave me first.
