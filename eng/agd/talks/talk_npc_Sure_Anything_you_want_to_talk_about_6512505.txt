# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Sure. Anything you want to talk about?
Rege: Hmm... I've been so caught up with the town's reconstruction work that I've been blind and deaf to everything else...
Rege: But now that I'm free, I find myself disinterested in gossip and the like.
Rege: I should find something to do and keep myself busy. It's the only way to keep my thoughts from running wild.
Rege: It would be nice to sail across the ocean to somewhere else or get some other new hobby.
