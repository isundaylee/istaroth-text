Traveler: Tell me about the Melusine tour guides...
Grosley: As far as I know, Melusines are our special companions.
Grosley: But don't underestimate them on account of their appearance. The ones amongst them in uniform are detectives from the Marechaussee Phantom.
Grosley: ...That includes the guides.
Grosley: Just like us humans, different Melusines have their unique personalities.
Grosley: The sort of introduction you'll get will thus depend on the Melusine serving as your guide.
