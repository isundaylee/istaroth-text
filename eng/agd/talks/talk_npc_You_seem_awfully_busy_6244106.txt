Traveler: You seem awfully busy.
Suling: Heh, well, it's actually alright. The busiest I've been lately was when we were back in Inazuma. The Captain even told me to get geared up for some rough times.
Suling: I heard the other crew members praising you to the skies after our romp there.
Suling: Well, if you've got any ideas on how we can improve our weaponry, remember to give me a shout!
