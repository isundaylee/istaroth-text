# Shadow of the Cat


## Talk 1

Ooshima Junpei: Hmm, this still doesn't feel quite right...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Ooshima Junpei: Ah, Traveler, you're here! Just the person I wanted to see.
Ooshima Junpei: Recently, I've gotten the feeling that the wood carvings I've been making... don't have... you know, life.
Traveler: Well, they are made of wood.
Ooshima Junpei: Oh, that's not what I mean...
Ooshima Junpei: Hmm. How do I explain this? What I'm looking for is...
Ooshima Junpei: You see, our provisional head priestess is mostly asleep, but at times, she will wake and wander about.
Ooshima Junpei: While on her walks, she will hop or jump, pounce at some fallen leaves, or stretch, and things like that...
Ooshima Junpei: I want to capture that in motion. I want to make carvings using these actions as a basis. That's what I mean by "life."
Traveler: Well, go see for yourself, then...
Ooshima Junpei: Well, I, uh... I'm a little embarrassed to do that.
Ooshima Junpei: Whatever we say, she is my boss. I feel like if I were to squat beside her and observe, I might make her unhappy...
Ooshima Junpei: Your relationship, on the other hand, should be way better. So, could you help me take a few pictures to use as reference material?
Traveler: Alright, alright, I got it...
Ooshima Junpei: Alright, thanks so much, Traveler. Just bring me those pictures once you're done taking them.
Traveler: No guarantees on capturing the actions you want...
Ooshima Junpei: No problem. You don't have to go for those big movements. I don't think my carving technique could keep up with that at the moment...
Ooshima Junpei: Just capture a few poses. I think that'll do for now.
Traveler: Well, she's right over there...
Traveler: What sort of "life" are you looking to inject into your art?

## Talk 2

Ooshima Junpei: I'll leave the picture-taking business to you. Just bring them to me once you're done.

## Talk 3

Neko: Mm? What are you doing?
Traveler: Taking pictures.
Neko: ...And what are those? You truly are strange.
Neko: Eh, it matters not. Continue as you were â€” just refrain from messing the shrine up.

## Talk 4

Ooshima Junpei: How did it go? Did you get the pictures?
Traveler: Wasn't that hard.
Ooshima Junpei: Let me see... Ooh! This angle... This pose... Pretty good! Pretty good indeed!
Traveler: Well, aren't you excited...
Ooshima Junpei: Oh, they'll more than do!
Ooshima Junpei: Thank you so much, Traveler. Please take these. I'll start practicing in just a moment.
Ooshima Junpei: Oh ho ho, this is pretty good...
Traveler: Will these do?
