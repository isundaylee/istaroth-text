Traveler: Takayuki...?
Ikeda Soushirou: Takayuki, of the Kujou Clan.
Ikeda Soushirou: I am a Kujou Clan retainer. Of course I remember every member of his family. Takayuki is a gifted boy with big aspirations. He'll be somebody one day, that's for sure.
Ikeda Soushirou: I don't know if his grades are still as good as before though, haha!

Traveler: You seem to have mistaken me for someone else...
Ikeda Soushirou: Eh, you're not one of the Kujou Clan kids, huh... Indeed, I have been working for his clan my whole life. I don't think I've ever seen anyone like you...
Ikeda Soushirou: Ah, I must really be getting too old... A word advice for you, child. The younger you are, the more conscientious you should be. Don't make the wrong decision.

Traveler: Grades, huh...
Ikeda Soushirou: Yeah, youngster, studying is of the utmost importance. You need to study hard and train hard. Only one who is a fine warrior and scholar both can become the backbone of the Kujou Clan.
Ikeda Soushirou: If you asked me, the youngsters from the Kujou Clan should learn from Sara! Sara excels at martial arts and is very loyal to the Kujou Clan. Although she was adopted by Takayuki, she is still far more reliable than many actual clan members, haha!
