Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Yanfei: Great! Very well! I feel right at home, actually.
Yanfei: Maybe you've forgotten, but this whole Sub-Space Creation thing is nothing new to me.
Traveler: So... you must be able to make your own one of these, right?
Yanfei: Well... it can be a little...
Yanfei: ...Iâ€”It's not my forte, okay!?
Yanfei: Anyway, I'm all settled in here now. Making my own would just be redundant.
Yanfei: You should worry about yourself, not me.
Traveler: Then does the mighty and illuminated Yanfei have any suggestions?
Yanfei: One does, as a matter of fact! One thinks you should create a few rooms specifically for housing legal codices.
Yanfei: But this is your home, of course. The rules are yours to decide.
