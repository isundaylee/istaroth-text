Vlad: What are you doing?
Vlad: I'm waiting for a boat, a boat that will come at an unknown time, a boat that will take me home.
Vlad: My name is Vlad. I was transferred from my home country of Snezhnaya to come work here in Liyue.
Vlad: I've already been in this city for some time now, but clearly it's impossible for me to fit in here. So I've sent an application to headquarters to be transferred back home, but I don't know when the boat will arrive.
Vlad: Even though I live here, I don't interact at all with the people of this city, except for just one person.
Vlad: Tell me about that person.
Vlad: She's also a guard at the Northland Bank like me, except I have the day shift, and she has the night shift.
Vlad: It's as if I'm the sun, and she's the moon. Even though we're aware of one another's existence, our paths will never meet. I guess that's just how it's meant to be.
Vlad: Then one day out of the blue, she left a letter for me right where we change the guard. We've been writing each other as pen pals ever since.
Vlad: Although I can't wait for the boat to arrive, reading her letters is the only thing that makes my heart feel at ease.
