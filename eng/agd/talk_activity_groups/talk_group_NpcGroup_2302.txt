## Talk

Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": Hello there. Haven't seen a young person pass this way for a good long while now. Are you here to solve the problem caused by those meteorites, by any chance?

## Talk

Traveler: About Hanfeng's Ironmongers...
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": I built that business up from nothing to what it is today. The heart's still willing... but unfortunately, the body has grown weak.
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": Sometimes I forget about my old age, you know. I'll go out for a walk, gather a few Iron Chunks out of habit, and only when I bring them back does it finally dawn on me that I can't even lift a hammer anymore...
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": Take 'em, if you can use them... If you ever have the chance, go pay a visit to my son in Liyue Harbor. He's now just as good as his old man was back in his prime.
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": And if you do visit him, please give him a message from me: Tell him his old man's safe and well.

## Talk

Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": Oh, hello! It's been ages since I last saw a youngster like you around these parts.

## Talk

Traveler: Are young people so rare here?
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": They all left for Liyue Harbor. Young people always prefer somewhere a bit more exciting.
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": I used to run a blacksmith's there — Hanfeng's Ironmongers. My apprentices would all have been around your age.
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": Personally, I don't like Liyue Harbor, though. All that hustle and bustle... I'm too old to work with iron now, so I thought I might as well head back to the countryside and help out where I can, while I still have strength in me.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about your family.
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": My son is still in Liyue — he runs Hanfeng's Ironmongers now that I've left. I guess the business is his inheritance now.
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": *sigh* It is good that there's someone to take over the shop after I worked so hard to make it what it is... But I do get lonely here, all on my own in my old age.
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": He rarely has the chance to visit, so I don't know how he's doing. The other thing is... He's getting on in age now, too, but all he cares about is his work. Work is important, but he never makes the effort to think about the most important thing of all in life.
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": Oh?
Traveler: Wh—What are you... wondering?
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": #I'm looking at you and I'm thinking to myself, what a fine young man you are! Handsome and well-spoken...
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": My son has a strong pair of arms and a gentle demeanor; he knows his way equally well around social events and around the kitchen...
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": If you are heading to Liyue, it can't hurt to pay him a visit, can it? Or maybe you can introduce him to someone?
Traveler: ...I...
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": Hahaha, never mind then, I don't want to make your life difficult. Forgive me. It's just, his mother passed away a long time ago, and as his father I can't help but get a little over-eager to see him settle down and have a family... Hope you can understand.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Hanfeng, "Cold Blade": Be careful out there! *sigh* Oh, to be young again...
