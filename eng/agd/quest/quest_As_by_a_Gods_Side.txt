# As by a God's Side


## Talk 1

Paimon: He's over there! Let's go say hi.

## Talk 2

Dehya: Heh, that Harbinger may have tried to cover his trail, but he still left some traces.
Dehya: Or perhaps, he never even thought about concealing his whereabouts. Maybe that's just how arrogant he really is...

## Talk 3

Dehya: According to Tighnari, The Doctor is leaving Sumeru soon. I want to check if The Doctor was actually telling the truth.
Dehya: He also said that he will "take care of everything" before he leaves. What did he mean by that? We need to be extra careful when dealing with a person like him.
Dehya: Just to be safe, let's chase him and see what we find.
Paimon: But we have no idea where he went. How can we start chasing him?
Dehya: We'll do it the mercenary way. I'll find leads as we go, all you have to do is just follow me.

## Talk 4

Tighnari: You can just focus on your plan. Leave Haypasia to me.
Tighnari: My wound isn't going to get in the way... Argh! Okay... Guess I'll sit still for a little while longer.

## Talk 5

Dehya: We can stop here. I think I know where The Doctor went.
Dehya: To the south of here is Port Ormos, which seems to be where they're headed.
Paimon: Port Ormos... they're going to leave by boat?
Dehya: That's right. Let's go to the port and have a look for ourselves.

## Talk 6

Fatui Sergeant: Now, THIS is a proper farewell ceremony for a Snezhnayan Harbinger!
Fatui Soldier: The Lord Harbinger is leaving... *sigh* I've still only seen him once or twice...

## Talk 7

Tighnari: "Sooner or later, everyone must pay the price for what they've learned"... Hmph, what an arrogant statement.
Tighnari: Oh, don't mind me, I was just thinking about his words. Be sure to take extra care of yourselves.

## Talk 8

Fatui Sergeant: No, no, I remember it like it was yesterday! Both his expressions and tones are now very different.
Fatui Sergeant: Also, for some reason, he seems like he's... all smiles now.
Fatui Soldier: You must be mistaken... Nobody's supposed to look happy when they're on a business trip.

## Talk 9

Dehya: Yep, we're headed in the right direction.
Dehya: The traces are still fresh, but there's no sign of his entourage. Clearly, they're in a hurry.

## Talk 10

Dehya: The Doctor is on that boat.
Dehya: Hmph, so he told the truth after all. He is actually leaving Sumeru.
Dehya: Let's get closer and find a place to hide so we can observe him.

## Talk 11

Paimon: Oh, have the Fatui retreated?
Traveler: Tighnari and Dehya are over there!
Paimon: Hey! What happened to you!?
Dehya: He's hurt.
Tighnari: I'm fine... Ugh!
Dehya: Don't move. I've seen Eremites get struck by lightning before. You need to rest.
Paimon: Struck by lightning!?
Dehya: We were fighting, and just as things started looking grim, the weather suddenly became extremely strange. Lightning started attacking everyone, almost as if it were alive.
Dehya: Luckily, there were only two of us, and both of us were nimble enough to dodge most of the strikes. There were a lot of Fatui, though, and they were being torn to shreds by the bolts of lightning.
Tighnari: With that, all the Fatui soldiers were forced to retreat...
Traveler: Your wound...
Tighnari: It's alright.
Tighnari: My wound aside, you look like... you've seen something unpleasant. Is Haypasia alright?
Traveler: She's okay for now, but I want to tell you something.
Tighnari: Ugh...!
Dehya: Hey! Didn't I tell you not to move?
Tighnari: Just in case... Ugh! Let's... go to Haypasia's place, and talk about things there.
Traveler: ...I'm really sorry.
Tighnari: Why are you sorry?
Traveler: I might have triggered the thunder and lightning...
Tighnari: Huh... It's alright, I'm sure you also never expected this to happen. Don't blame yourself.

## Talk 12

Tighnari: ...
Tighnari: Thank goodness, she's fine.
Paimon: Hey, how about taking care of yourself first?
Tighnari: I understand my condition... *grimace* The wound is not fatal. I'll be alright.
Paimon: Ugh, the more you understand medicine, the worse of a patient you become...
Dehya: I know. They always think they can push through the pain.
Tighnari: Ugh... agh!
Paimon: Oh, he sat down!
Tighnari: #Let me rest for a bit... *exhale* Sorry, Traveler, now you may start.
Black Screen Text: You recount everything from "meeting" The Doctor at Port Ormos to your encounter with The Balladeer while checking up on Haypasia.
Paimon: So that's what you were talking to The Balladeer about? Paimon can't believe what he's thinking...
Tighnari: The Akademiya's... god creation plan... How ridiculous.
Dehya: That sounds, uh... ambitious, I guess? Anyway, this is all way beyond me.
Dehya: As long as I can enjoy every day with a drink in my hand, tasty food in my stomach, and a good night's rest, that's enough. I'll only work when I have to.
Dehya: Ahaha, I must be the least ambitious person who's ever set foot in Pardis Dhyai.
Tighnari: Don't say that. I haven't even thanked you for your help back there.
Dehya: Don't mention it.
Dehya: Well, if nothing else, all this proves that The Doctor really did have some urgent matter to attend to, and left Sumeru in a hurry.
Traveler: Yeah, and I also have a theory.
Traveler: I think The Balladeer is the reason why The Doctor is targeting Haypasia.
Dehya: Hmm. Maybe the Fatui want to cover up some secret of The Balladeer? Is that why they tried to seize Haypasia?
Paimon: You said The Balladeer claimed that Haypasia has seen his past... So what could be there?
Traveler: For now, I'm still not really sure.
Dehya: Have you noticed? The Balladeer is not happy with The Doctor's actions. He thinks The Doctor has no right to consider himself as his equal.
Paimon: So, if The Doctor was to show up again, would The Balladeer zap him with lightning?
Dehya: #Based on what Traveler has said, I think he would. Having The Doctor gone benefits him as well as us.
Dehya: In other words, we've successfully completed this stage of the plan! The Doctor is out of the picture now.
Paimon: Yay, that's a big accomplishment!
Tighnari: Ugh! I'm... also happy for you.
Dehya: Thank you for the help, Tighnari. Make sure you rest up for now.
Traveler: Yes, please do get some rest.
Tighnari: Yeah, yeah... alright.
Dehya: #Okay, that wraps things up for us here at Pardis Dhyai. Traveler, it's about time we rendezvous with the others at the Grand Bazaar.
Dehya: Let's continue to keep a low profile. You can head there once you're ready.
Traveler: Her consciousness connected to The Balladeer, and she has seen his past...

## Talk 13

Alhaitham: Alright, everyone is here.
Dehya: How did everything go? Any luck with your missions?
Alhaitham: Let's each report back one by one. I'll start first.
Alhaitham: We have made the necessary modifications to the Akasha Terminal. In addition, the props required are also ready.
Dehya: #I'll go next. Traveler and I went to Pardis Dhyai. The situation was a bit complicated, but we found Tighnari. Unfortunately, he was wounded during a fight.
Cyno: ...Who was behind it?
Dehya: #Uh... Well, that's the tough part... What should I say, Traveler? "The Fatui" or "The Balladeer"?
Traveler: Let's go with "The Balladeer."
Cyno: ...
Dehya: After some back-and-forth, we confirmed that The Doctor has left Sumeru by boat. He has something urgent to attend to back in Snezhnaya.
Dehya: So, we've successfully removed The Doctor from the picture. Also, Tighnari's already resting, so he'll be okay.
Alhaitham: Good.
Paimon: Oh, Tighnari also asked us to tell you this message! "Trust your own senses and experiences."
Cyno: Alright... I'll remember that.
Cyno: Everything also went smoothly on my side. The Eremites should have arrived at their destination by now.
Cyno: To avoid alerting the quarry, they will stay there for now.
Dehya: I can't believe you actually got so many Eremites into Sumeru City!
Cyno: It's all thanks to Rahman and his brave team, as well as their bold strategy.
Alhaitham: It appears to have been very effective. I'm glad to hear it.
Alhaitham: Well, is that everything? Okay, this meeting is adjourned.
Dehya: Huh? Wait, you mean that's it?
Alhaitham: Well, what else is there to discuss?
Dehya: Shouldn't you end with some words of encouragement? You know, to fire us up now?
Alhaitham: Personally, I'd rather we all go home and get some rest.
Cyno: ...
Dehya: Alhaitham, you... *sigh*
Alhaitham: Oh, and if you wanted someone to say something to that effect, then I must reiterate that I'm here to strategize, not to lead.
Alhaitham: So you should find someone more suitable to do that.
Dehya: But I thought all of you Akademiya big-shots were great speakers?
Alhaitham: Then I should remind you that I'm the Scribe.
Dehya: I know that, so what?
Alhaitham: A Scribe is responsible for recording meetings, not speaking.
Dehya: ...Fine, whatever.
Dehya: Well, Cyno doesn't seem to be much of a talker, either. I guess that leaves it to my "employer."
Cyno: Employer?
Dehya: #Yep, Traveler hired me.
Traveler: She asked for a smile as her payment.
Dehya: Haha, that's right. So c'mon, boss! What do you have to say for the team?
Paimon: Yeah! Say something to boost morale!
Traveler: Hmm... let me think...
Nilou (???): Huh? What are you all doing here?
Paimon: Oh, it's Nilou!
Nilou: Hey everyone! I'm not disturbing you, am I?
Dehya: Not at all. I was actually just about to go find you.
Nilou: Heehee. Uh, judging from the group and all your serious faces, you were discussing something important, weren't you?
Nilou: But you also look like you're up to no good... Haha, seems pretty interesting.
Alhaitham: Welcome, Nilou. Would you like to join us?
Nilou: Huh? Join you?
Nilou: You mean... you also want to discuss something important... with me?
Alhaitham: Yes, something very important.
Alhaitham: Nilou, are there any breaks in your performance schedule in the upcoming days?
Nilou: Huh? Wait, you're seriously inviting me?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_BLACK_SCREEN): Alhaitham tells Nilou of the plan on Jnagarbha Day...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_BLACK_SCREEN): Nilou is shocked at first, but it isn't long before she's bubbling with excitement and anticipation.
Nilou: I... I can't believe my ears! You are truly the bravest and most passionate people of Sumeru, well, that... I've ever met!
Paimon: Ahem!
Nilou: #Oh right, Traveler and Paimon are not from Sumeru, but you are awesome as well!
Paimon: Hehe, that's right!
Nilou: I... I must admit that I'm a little scared.
Nilou: But I'll try my best for Lesser Lord Kusanali. If I can somehow use my abilities to help you, then count me in.
Cyno: Remember, believe in yourself.
Nilou: ...Okay! I'll get my friends at the Grand Bazaar to help us tomorrow!
Dehya: Just remember not to say too much. Be discreet.
Nilou: Yep, you got it!
Alhaitham: All the preparations are done. Now, can we finally conclude this meeting?
Traveler: Yeah. Tomorrow, we are going to save a god.
Dehya: So, have you thought up what you'd like to say, boss?
Traveler: It's hard to believe everything that has happened till now...
Paimon: Yep yep! It's a grand plan, and we're all super awesome!
Traveler: That's right, so...
Traveler: Just get a good night's sleep, everyone!
Dehya: Hahaha!
Cyno: Well said. A good night's rest before an operation can be the difference between success and failure.
Alhaitham: ...Thankfully, I've had my place to myself recently. It's been nice and quiet.
Dehya: ...Huh?
Alhaitham: Oh, huh, nothing.
Paimon: Alright, let's all go home and get a good night's sleep, so we can be up early tomorrow!
Nilou: Okay, so I guess that means it's time to say goodnight now.
Paimon: Yep! Goodnight, everyone.
Traveler: And our actions will bring change to many things tomorrow.
