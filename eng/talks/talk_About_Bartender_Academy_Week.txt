Traveler: About "Bartender Academy Week"...
Luka: Well, this activity was originally intended to enlist new talent for our tavern.
Luka: The drinkers are many, but those who mix drinks are few. Charles can barely get a single day off all year...
Luka: As such, we started this event to help drum up interest in the bartending occupation!
Luka: What do you think, Traveler? What do you say?
