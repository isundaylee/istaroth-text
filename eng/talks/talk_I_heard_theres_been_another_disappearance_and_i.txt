Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "I heard there's been another disappearance, and it's the same modus operandi as the 'The serial disappearances of young women' case."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Didn't they already get the guy? The murderer was the former head of the Spina di Rosula, Callas the Unfaithful, wasn't it?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "I don't think it's that simple, I think there's a conspiracy at work here. Maybe there's no disappearances at all, and it's all an act."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "With regards to the 'The serial disappearances of young women' case, please defer to official announcements, and do not engage in baseless speculation or spread groundless rumors.
