# Talk Dialog

Sucrose: Hi there, are you here to take a look at my stall? I have a lot of newly developed research products.
Traveler: Do you want to chat?
Sucrose: Um, okay, go ahead...
Traveler: About your stall...
Sucrose: Oh, this?
Sucrose: I actually wrote out all the nutritional information and prices for my Bio-Alchemy products in advance. But the customers still prefer to ask directly...
Sucrose: So... I just read off the sheet for them...
Sucrose: Running a stall is a huge challenge for me.
Sucrose: Maybe I could get Noelle to interact with the customers, and I do the rest... Mmm, no, never mind... She's probably busy enough already.
Traveler: About your Bio-Alchemy products...
Sucrose: I have here the Iota-Series Rapid-Acting Deep Freeze Mist Flower, the Theta-Series Fragrance-Enhanced Sweet Flower, Variation 21...
Sucrose: And the Epsilon-Series Tetrasweet Sunsettia, Variation 63. I'm proud to put my name to all of these products!
Sucrose: You won't need me to read out all the details, right?
Traveler: About Razor...
Sucrose: I'm sorry for running off back then...
Sucrose: I just thought that you and Noelle would do a better job of expressing things than I could...
Sucrose: Did everything work out in the end? Mixing the Epsilon-Series Tetrasweet Sunsettia, Variation 63 with the other ingredients didn't cause any problems, did it?
Sucrose: Oh, and uh... how did things go with Razor...
Traveler: Don't worry. Everything turned out great.
Sucrose: Phew... Thank goodness.
Sucrose: Then... can I ask you for a favor? I want to make a note of the full recipe for the Thousand-Wind Wine we made.
Sucrose: That way, we'll be able to recreate the exact same flavor we did today in the future, no matter how many years go by.
Traveler: I'll leave you in peace.
Sucrose: Oh, sure. No problem.
