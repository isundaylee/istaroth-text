Zhongli: This year's Xiao Lanterns and fireworks seem more exquisite than ever.
Traveler: Ah, you're back in the city.
Zhongli: Yes, after a most worthwhile journey.
Zhongli: Had I not heeded your advice, I fear I may have missed out on the scenes I saw. Thank you, Traveler.
Traveler: You're welcome.
Zhongli: Liyue's beauty always gladdens my heart. There is everything from the graceful to the grandiose, from serenity to splendor. And the ways in which the sights of Liyue stir the heart... They must be seen to be experienced.
Zhongli: The people of Liyue today are busier than ever before. Yet still they head home when the festival season comes, no matter how long the journey takes, just for the chance to sit around the stove and share a joyful time with their loved ones.
Zhongli: Even a glimpse of Liyue's scenery on their homeward journey can serve to comfort their spirits.
Zhongli: Traveler, this view belongs to you as much as to anyone else. Though your journey ahead may be long and much awaits for you to accomplish, I hope that each time you return to Liyue, sights such as these will put your mind at ease.
Zhongli: A safe haven between the mountains, a warm glow that guides you out from a dense forest. Like the stars in the sky, may the lights of this city always shine for you, Traveler, even from beyond the clouds.
