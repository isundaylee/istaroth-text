Wangjuan: Well, here I was hoping for a catch... Didn't think I'd get an unusual outsider instead of a fish!

Traveler: Why are you fishing here?
Wangjuan: Sorry, what? Speak up, I can't hear you~
Wangjuan: Hmm. Nevermind. I read your lips, and if I'm not wrong, you're wondering why I'm fishing by the waterfall — just as everyone else who's asked.
Wangjuan: See the shallow area over there? Some unfortunate fish come plummeting off the waterfall, dying the moment they crash into the rocks.
Wangjuan: I feel bad for them, but I can't let them perish in vain either.
Wangjuan: So I cook them into delicious dishes and eat them with gratitude.
Wangjuan: Thanks to them, I don't have to worry about food, nor do I have to catch other fish.
Wangjuan: If you look at the big picture, the number of fish that die in Chenyu Vale each day declines thanks to me, and that's a good deed, wouldn't you say?
Wangjuan: I only catch the fish that are destined to be baited, and I think of it as making friends...

Traveler: YOU'RE SPEAKING TOO LOUDLY.
Wangjuan: What? Louder, please!
Wangjuan: We who live near the lower Yilong Wharf are bombarded by the sound of the waterfall every day, so our hearing tends to not be that sharp.
Wangjuan: Stay safe while checking out the waterfall, you hear?
Wangjuan: The huge difference in height and the violent waters can crush even the most sturdy battleships, let alone an ordinary human.
Wangjuan: Well, not that you feel ordinary in the slightest, but best not to take the risk anyway.

Traveler: I'll leave you alone...
Wangjuan: Hmm... Will I make any fish friends today?

Traveler: What a unique point of view...
Wangjuan: The water's too loud! I can't hear you at all.
Wangjuan: Let me guess... You think I'm strange, right?
Wangjuan: Now, I used to be a fisherman who didn't care about anything other than catching fish and making money.
Wangjuan: But several years ago, I heard about the legend about Carp fish from Mr. Deyin at the teahouse.
Wangjuan: The Carp and the Carp Adeptus have been nothing but kind to everyone in Chenyu Vale, but I might have hurt some of the Carp when I was fishing.
Wangjuan: I didn't want to make that mistake again!
Wangjuan: But I don't have any other skills. I've got to do this to make ends meet.
Wangjuan: So if you see a special Carp when you're fishing, please let them go. It'll bring you good fortune!
