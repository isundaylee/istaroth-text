Tartaglia: #Well, Traveler, you invited me to meet you here, so I'm guessing that means you're ready for a rematch?
Tartaglia: Haha, I'm just kidding, of course. This place is for resting, I wouldn't start a fight here â€” I do have some manners.
Tartaglia: I am getting a little restless here, though. Hope the next battle's a big one, I need a good workout.
