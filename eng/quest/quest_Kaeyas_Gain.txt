# Kaeya's Gain


## Talk 1

Paimon: This time, the mysteries have all been solved, it sure took a lot of work.
Paimon: But in all fairness, this treasure map really is terrible... It looks like it was drawn by a pirate...
Paimon: So now...
Traveler: Let's report to Kaeya first.
Paimon: Hmm? Paimon believes that there is no need!
Paimon: You read my mind! Paimon's so happy!
Paimon: Let's go for it! Don't want anyone else to get there before we do!
Paimon: Like... like the Treasure Hoarders Kaeya told us about.
Paimon: Anyways, Paimon just wants to borrow the sword to...
Paimon: No, you heard nothing! Paimon ah— Paimon just wants to see it!
Paimon: Definitely not to become super, mega, powerful and do nothing but play...
Paimon: Hehe... Alright, Paimon'll save the chit-chat for later.
Paimon: Arcadian treasure hunt, here we go!
Traveler: Let's go to the treasure location directly!

## Talk 2

Paimon: This must be the Arcadian Ruins.
Paimon: Is it just me, or does it look... plain?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it! The perfect disguise is always in plain sight!
Paimon: Kaeya's grandpa sure is impressive.
???: *pitter-patter*
Traveler: Listen, Paimon...
Paimon: Oh! Mice.
Traveler: You didn't even try, did you?
Paimon: It's no time to get suspicious. We're close!
Paimon: Hurry! The treasure is waiting for us!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Ugh... Is this the end?
Paimon: Where are you, my treasure!?
Paimon: #Let's look around, {NICKNAME}.
???: Hahaha... I'll save you the trouble.
???: How about you let me take over?
Traveler: The Treasure Hoarders?
???: Sharp eye, but too slow.
Izzard: I'm Izzard.
Izzard: I thank you both on behalf of the Treasure Hoarders.
Paimon: Ugh...
Paimon: We've been keeping a low profile, how did word get out?
Traveler: Low... profile...?
Paimon: Hmph! Paimon won't let you have the treasure without a fight!
Izzard: You would be wise to not underestimate us.
Izzard: My gang is just outside waiting for my order.
Izzard: However, they're not as... sociable as me.
Kaeya: (Kaeya and the Knights of Favonius enter)
Kaeya: I'm sorry to rain on your parade...
Kaeya: But your gang won't be participating in your current plan.
Kaeya: If you'd like to ask why, you can go see them... in Mondstadt Prison.
Kaeya: Or perhaps you'd prefer to join them permanently?
Izzard: The Knights...?
Paimon: Hey, it's Kaeya!
Paimon: Kaeya, he wants to steal your treasure! Get him!
Izzard: Ugh... almost had it!
Kaeya: Oh, you mean the treasure?
Kaeya: Sorry, but there wasn't any treasure to begin with.
Kaeya: You came all the way... for nothing. Just give it up.
Paimon: What?
Paimon: No... treasure?
Paimon: Did Kaeya just say, there isn't any treasure?
Izzard: Hah. You got me good. Didn't think the Knights would resort to such tactics.
Kaeya: A thief has no right to criticize the methods of the Knights of Fav— Wait, what are you...
Izzard: You're not gonna get me!
Izzard: Okay... Oh god... Wh—What is this? I didn't mean it!
Traveler: The black market?
???: Well, I did have dealings with them.
???: But them and their stupid principles... Losers who can't make a fortune.

## Talk 4

Izzard: How embarrassing... Having my life saved by a knight...
Kaeya: Don't forget what you promised... or that thing will be the least of your worries.
Izzard: Hey... Is this how the Knights of Favonius treats the people they catch?
Kaeya: I'm just joking. Alright... Let's take him back.
Knight of Favonius: Sir! Yes sir!
Knight of Favonius: Captain, should we take these two in as well?
Paimon: What!?
Kaeya: Haha, of course not. They are the ones who made this arrest possible.
Traveler: So the intel is fake.
Traveler: There is no treasure.
Traveler: You lied to us?
Kaeya: Without them spreading our <color=#00E1FFFF>fabricated intel</color>, we wouldn't have been able to catch the Treasure Hoarders.
Paimon: *cries* You're a bad man for lying to me... Shame on the Knights!
Kaeya: Alright, alright... Stop it already.
Kaeya: Though the treasure doesn't exist, you did want it for yourself, didn't you?
Kaeya: Otherwise, you would have informed me of your intentions, no?
Paimon: That... well... ah... Hmph!
Paimon: #Let's go, {NICKNAME}. Paimon's done talking to him!
Kaeya: Ha. Just a sec.
Kaeya: You did help me out, so you do deserve a reward.
Kaeya: This is the "Triumphant Harbinger of Dawn That Points Towards Victory." As its name suggests, it symbolizes light and victory.
Kaeya: If you don't mind, I would like to present you with this Harbinger of Dawn as a reward.
Paimon: Harbinger of Dawn?
Kaeya: That's right. It suits a well-cultured and disciplined person such as yourself, wouldn't you say, Paimon?
Paimon: Well... If the reward is this Harbinger of Dawn...
Kaeya: You'd forgive me, right?
Kaeya: I'm honored to have such an understanding friend.
Paimon: Yes... yes...
Traveler: ...Paimon has been completely charmed.
Traveler: Means you'll use a different method next time?
Kaeya: You have my apologies for the deception. I will not use the same method twice.
Kaeya: What a wonderful day. Now, I have to go interrogate my suspect...
Kaeya: Please excuse me. Do come visit me at our headquarters when you have the chance.

Kaeya: You have my apologies for the deception. I will not use the same method twice.
Kaeya: What a surprise that you solved the puzzles all by yourself and arrived before me.
Paimon: So it was you who left all those clues?
Kaeya: Indeed. However, even I believed the clues were too vague to be of any help to you.
Kaeya: I was prepared to answer your questions...
Kaeya: Quite impressive. This was the only thing that I did not anticipate in the entire operation.
Traveler: It was a cakewalk!
Traveler: Uh, actually, I tapped into other sources for help...
Paimon: Hah! That was nothing!
Kaeya: No matter what you say, I acknowledge your wisdom. After all, wisdom itself does not deceive.
Paimon: But some people do enjoy deceiving others with their wits!
Kaeya: Hahaha...
Kaeya: What a wonderful day. Now, I have to go interrogate my suspect...
Kaeya: Please excuse me. Do come visit me at our headquarters when you have the chance.
