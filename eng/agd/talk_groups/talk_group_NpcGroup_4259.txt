Traveler: Amurta's project...
Jazari: I've applied for it, but haven't heard anything since then... Could the academic trends have changed recently?
Jazari: As the saying goes, "The road to happiness is fraught with setbacks." Sometimes one has to wait a bit longer for a positive outcome.
Jazari: Don't worry, when that day comes, I won't forget your contribution.

Traveler: What are you doing here?
Jazari: Organizing the research results from before, of course.
Jazari: I didn't expect such a giant volume of data. I don't know how much more time this will cost me.
Jazari: But it would be irresponsible to publish the results before organizing them.

Traveler: So "Pir" is a title?
Jazari: Isn't it? I'm not too sure either. Only the Hara{RUBY#[S]Semiotics}vatat fellows care about these things.
Jazari: We Kshahrewar are only concerned about genuine techniques.

Traveler: About Sumeru cuisine...
Jazari: Huh? I don't remember promising to treat you guys to any Sumeru cuisine.
Jazari: But since you've helped me out loads, I don't mind treating you to a meal of Curry Shrimp or something similar.
Jazari: But let's wait until my results have been published successfully. I'll make sure to fill your bellies, be it Curry Shrimp, or even Tandoori Roast Chicken!
