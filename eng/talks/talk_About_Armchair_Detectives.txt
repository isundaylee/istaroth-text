# Talk Dialog

Traveler: About Armchair Detectives...
Paimon: So apparently, some detectives in Fontaine manage to solve cases without ever setting foot outside their homes. They call them "armchair detectives"...
Paimon: That's what they call "working from home," right? Sounds pretty cushy.
Paimon: Still, how do they figure out the truth if they never even go to the crime scene? ...Oh, Paimon knows! They must be using divination.
Traveler: You're thinking of fortune-tellers, Paimon. Not detectives.
Paimon: Oh... yeah...
Traveler: In any case...
Paimon: You mean... Oh, the detective must have people collecting information for them...
Traveler: Perhaps, or...
Paimon: Huh? But... that would mean the detective gets all the credit for our hard work! Bet they make a tidy sum of Mora off of it, too! Hmph, Paimon won't stand for that. Let's go have a little talk with Detective Armchair right now!
Traveler: Maybe they post commissions at the Adventurers Guild?
Traveler: Surely the evidence isn't just dropping itself off at the detective's doorstep.
