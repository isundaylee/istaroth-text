# Bantan Sango Case File: Misdirection


## Talk 1

Treasure Hoarder: It's you people again? Come on! I haven't even done anything yet!
Ryuuji: Sorry, we have orders to preemptively prevent criminal activities. Let's do this, Traveler.
Treasure Hoarder: What... what the? Wait, listen!

## Talk 2

Ryuuji: Yeah, we made quite a big ruckus this time too. Amano and Mr. Andou will assist us in letting that thief learn about this in town.
Traveler: How much longer will this take?
Ryuuji: Not long now. Once Sango is ready, we can close this case.
Ryuuji: Here is your payment, Traveler. Thank you for your help.
Ryuuji: This is the amount assigned by Sango herself, so I believe it should be commensurate. Please take them. We may yet have more work for you in the future.
