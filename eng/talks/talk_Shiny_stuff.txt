Traveler: Shiny stuff?
Xana: That's right. Shiny components just like this one!
Xana: As long as we've got enough of them, we might be able to create a super giant mega machine, one even larger than Elynas. Ooh, just thinking about it gets me all excited!
Xana: Sometimes, I'd go out of the village to collect little things that aren't shiny yet, and I would find ways to make them shiny!
Xana: Whatever the case, the more shiny stuff, the better! Like I said, if you've got some, you can exchange them here at Xana's!
