# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Much obliged.
Kamal: Sumeru City was built on the Divine Tree, with the upper level for the Akademiya and the lower level for the common folks. Move up if you seek further education or get a promotion. For a steady life pace, Grand Bazaar is your choice.
Kamal: Researchers led by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata cultivated a large rainforest right next to Sumeru City, which helped Sumeru survive the difficult times in the past.
Kamal: But it's not a good idea to delve too deep into the rainforest. Beasts and The Withering can be deadly. Be sure to call a Forest Ranger for help in case of danger.
Kamal: There are plenty of places to stay near the rainforest. The Gandharva Ville where Forest Rangers and Vanara gather, and the tranquil Vimara Village. You name it.
Kamal: Further south is Port Ormos, the largest import and export port in Sumeru. Most people who travel to Sumeru by water would enter through the port.
