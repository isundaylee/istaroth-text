# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Could you tell me more about yourself?
Fodil: If you're looking to get some intel on the pretext of small talk, then you've come to the wrong person.
Fodil: In any case, Aaru Village has never been home to any secrets.
Fodil: This is a place of exile for the Akademiya. Most people struggle to even make ends meet — never mind have any manner of strange thoughts.
Fodil: Secondly, we, the desert people, consider this place our final home. We will defend it no matter the cost.
Fodil: So it doesn't matter what your reasons are — if you threaten the stability of the village, we, the Aaru Village guards, will take action against you without a second thought.
