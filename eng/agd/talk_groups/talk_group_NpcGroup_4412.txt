Maruf: I'm the best doctor in Aaru Village — that is to say, the only doctor in Aaru Village.
Maruf: Though I'd say that my greatest specialty is bandaging wounds.
Maruf: People who get injured out in the desert often wind up here in the village, and they rely on me to treat their wounds.
Maruf: Though Aaru Village consists of mostly children and the elderly, most of them are in good health and rarely get afflicted with any serious illnesses.
Maruf: As for minor ailments, I just give out medicine based on previous experience, and everything usually turns out fine.

Traveler: What if it's a serious illness then?
Maruf: Do you mean diseases as terrible as Eleazar?
Maruf: I'm afraid that in such cases, even the researchers of Sumeru City might be of little help. The only thing they can do is leave it up to fate.
Maruf: Of course, such cases would be very extreme ones.
Maruf: If anything beyond my control crops up... Then all I can do is to attempt to have them sent to the city.

Traveler: What happens in the case of very serious illnesses, then?
Maruf: Well, if something else comes up that's clearly beyond my abilities... then I can only attempt to send them to the city.
