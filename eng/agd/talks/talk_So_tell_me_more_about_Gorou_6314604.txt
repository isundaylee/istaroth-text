Traveler: So, tell me more about Gorou...
Ookubo Daisuke: General Gorou is my greatest inspiration. He is skilled and valiant on the battlefield, and he is compassionate to his men off it â€” he sees us as his very own flesh and blood, almost.
Ookubo Daisuke: He's patient with our comrades even in the little things of life, helping them to resolve their problems.
Ookubo Daisuke: I doubt you could find a better general anywhere else!
