# Talk Dialog

Traveler: What's happened?
Doolan: It started off as just an issue of adventuring into the ruins — my specialty — but what does it matter now; it's become too layered and complex, and elusive.
Doolan: Do you know the feeling? It's like, just when you think you can't see the wood for the trees, suddenly you see a ray of light in the darkness and things take a turn for the better; then out of nowhere the answer is right under your nose. But it morphs again as you try to get a handle on it and suddenly it's got this ephemeral, dream-like quality to it...
Doolan: It's more subtle and ambiguous than an adventure — it's got this really strong romantic vibe, with a hint of danger...
Traveler: What in the world are you talking about?
Doolan: I do apologize— I'm an adventurer, and in principle there's no significant difference between an adventure and a chance encounter, but I just can't seem to get a handle on this one.
Doolan: Ms. Patchi is rash and impulsive, so adventuring with her would be high-risk. I worry that she would get injured.
Doolan: But most importantly of all, neither adventures nor chance encounters last forever; in both cases, if you hesitate the opportunity will pass you by.
Doolan: She's so persistent that there's nothing I can do other than to try and make this chance encounter last as long as possible.
Traveler: You seem like a shady character.
Doolan: Well, when one day you're traveling along and you suddenly come face to face with your destiny out of nowhere... Maybe it'll bring out the shady character in you, too.
Doolan: Adventuring is a romantic pursuit. When I do things like refusing to join the Adventurers' Guild because of their boring clothes, and stuff like that, it's all because I'm a romantic at heart.
Doolan: *sigh* It looks like it'll take both you and her some time to fully understand this feeling I feel... It's like an epiphany, but clouded somehow...
