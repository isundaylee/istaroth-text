Traveler: Could I stick around for a bit?
Karpa: Ah, we've got no competitions on now, so feel free to hang around if you wish.
Karpa: Once the preparations for the Pilgrimage begin, though, staff and contestants will be given priority use of this area.
Karpa: I'll also be here to make some competition-related announcements, such as times, things to look out for, and so on.
