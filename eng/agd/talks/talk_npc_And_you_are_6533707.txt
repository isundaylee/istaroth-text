Traveler: And you are?
Giovanni: I am Giovanni, a maker of fine instruments, and the current patrono of the Pasquale family.
Giovanni: My family has been making instruments for many generations. I am part of the 25th generation.
Giovanni: Long before the Opera Epiclese was built on Erinnyes, my ancestors were the luthiers who tuned the strings for Master Coppelius and his troupe.
Giovanni: I am proud to say that over the last 500 years, at least a third of Fontaine's instruments have come from my family's workshops.
