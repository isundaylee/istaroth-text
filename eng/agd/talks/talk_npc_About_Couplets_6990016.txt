Traveler: About Couplets
Paimon: Paimon's heard that couplets are a traditional art form in Liyue. If you can write a line that works as a second half to one that someone else has written, you'll be well paid!
Paimon: But linking the couplet is hard, so it's not easy money.
Paimon: Not only does the rhythm need to match, but the meaning has to as well.
Traveler: Hmm, care to give an example?
Paimon: Uh... "Windrise's winds never churn."
Traveler: ...Um, "But the Sea of Clouds' clouds always return."
Paimon: Huh... Not bad!
Paimon: Let's not waste time here. We've got some money to make!
