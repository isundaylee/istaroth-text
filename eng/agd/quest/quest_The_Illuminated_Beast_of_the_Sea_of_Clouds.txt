# The Illuminated Beast of the Sea of Clouds


## Talk 1

Paimon: So, Ganyu left to visit Cloud Retainer. Doesn't she live in Mt. Aocang?
Paimon: We should hurry up, Paimon hopes we can find her there!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Ganyu! Here you are!
Ganyu: You two... I did not expect to meet you here. Is it official or private affairs that bring you here?
Ganyu: Ah, I shouldn't... I have left the human world. Please contact the Yuehai Pavilion regarding matters concerning the commercial port.
Traveler: Left the human world?
Paimon: Huh, you don't want to be the Qixing's secretary anymore? But they're all waiting for you to come back...
Ganyu: That's why you're here? You want me to come back? I'm afraid you came here in vain.
Paimon: What? Did something happen?
Ganyu: The clouds fold and unfold, the tide ebbs and flows. It was meant to be.
Ganyu: When the adepti entrusted humans with overseeing Liyue, I knew it was only a matter of time until I had to leave.
Ganyu: My adepti blood makes me unwelcome in Liyue Harbor.
Ganyu: I delivered the letter and came back to Liyue Harbor only to discover that I had been replaced by Baiwen, Baixiao, and Baishi...
Ganyu: Perhaps that mission of mine was just a pretext to remove me. Since the Qixing gave me a chance to leave with dignity, I decided to be tactful, as well.
Traveler: I believe there's been a huge misunderstanding.
Ganyu: I appreciate your kindness but there's no need for your words of comfort.
Ganyu: After a thousand years away, I came back to Jueyun Karst. Looking at the clouds floating among the mountains brings me peace of mind. I feel better now.
Paimon: Uh, but...
Cloud Retainer: Who disturbs the peace of these mountains?
Paimon: Cloud Retainer? We're terribly sorry, we just...
Cloud Retainer: Hmph, one merely jests! One felt your presence the moment you set foot upon this land.
Paimon: Wow, you adepti really are impressive.
Cloud Retainer: Come here to chat about the old times with Ganyu? It looks like you get along quite well...
Traveler: Chat about the old times?
Ganyu: ...
Cloud Retainer: Ah... A matter leaves you at an impasse, then?
Cloud Retainer: Not to worry, one is exceptional at seeking avenues for conversation. One has been one's own companion in idle talk for many a year.
Cloud Retainer: Ah, yes. Since you are Ganyu's friends, tales from her youth shall one apprise you of, perhaps...
Ganyu: Cloud Retainer!
Cloud Retainer: Hahaha... Nothing to be ashamed of! You were so cute as a child, one is most certain that your friends would like to hear of it.
Traveler: I'm a bit curious, indeed...
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon wants to hear it!
Ganyu: Eh...
Cloud Retainer: Hehe... Little Ganyu loved when the horns on the top of her head were caressed.
Cloud Retainer: When one was still taking care of her, one was pestered most often to touch her horns. She was else-wise loath to sleep...
Paimon: Whoa...
Cloud Retainer: Plump she was, back then! Why, when she stumbled while we ascended the mountain, she would roll down to the bottom like a little ball...
Paimon: A—haha!
Cloud Retainer: ...The day Ganyu bumped into a pilgrim was the first time she saw a real human in the flesh.
Cloud Retainer: So fearful she was that she hid in a rock's cleft for two days and nights. One found her wailing of a monster she had seen...
Paimon: Hahaha...
Ganyu: CLOUD RE—TAI—NER!
Ganyu: *sigh* Forget it. It's about time for my training. I will take my leave!
Traveler: I think you upset Ganyu...
Cloud Retainer: Ah, one's intention was merely to relieve the awkward tension...
Paimon: And you did the exact opposite. Impressive.
Cloud Retainer: Be that so? Huh...
Cloud Retainer: But returning to Ganyu, most gladdened one is of your arrival.
Cloud Retainer: One cannot help but feel that remaining in Jueyun Karst shall not be good for her...
Cloud Retainer: One will tell you more about her, if you should permit it.
Cloud Retainer: One did, by chance, hear this much of Ganyu's thoughts.
Cloud Retainer: Alone, she will find her predicament hard to conquer. One hopes that you will accompany her...
Paimon: Oh, Retainer's right! We can't leave Ganyu depressed like that. Besides, Liyue hasn't given up on her, she's got it all wrong...
Paimon: Anyways, what's that "training" Ganyu was talking about?
Cloud Retainer: She has sought to reclaim her adeptus side since returning to Jueyun Karst. At her behest, one has organized training for her to achieve that end...
Cloud Retainer: She should be in the southern part of Mt. Aocang right now, preparing for the trial.
Paimon: Huh, is that so? Let's go take a look, then!
Traveler: It seems you didn't read the room...
Traveler: Now that's a good topic.
Traveler: Get along?
Traveler: Nobody wants to get rid of you...
Traveler: You seem different...

## Talk 3

Paimon: So here you are, Ganyu!
Ganyu: Why did you come here?
Traveler: We want to keep you company.
Ganyu: Ah, I... Humans should not remain in the realm of adepti for too long.
Ganyu: Hmm... Considering the kindness you have shown me, I can let you stay for the adeptus training.
Paimon: Yay~!
Ganyu: This trial was prepared by Cloud Retainer. Its goal is to help me feel like an adeptus again.
Ganyu: The training is much to her signature style... I hope it won't make it seem like she is too unaware of the abilities of others.
Paimon: I—Is it difficult?
Ganyu: No, I'm aware of your strength, Traveler. The power hidden within you is not inferior to mine.
Ganyu: If you're ready, we shall begin the training.
Traveler: I'd like to try this adeptus training.
Ganyu: Is that so? You really are interested in the ways of adepti.

## Talk 4

Ganyu: We've completed the task. What do you think?
Traveler: Perhaps I'd make a good adeptus.
Ganyu: I agree. You possess many qualities similar to those of adepti, despite having none of their blood.
Paimon: Ganyu, what were you planning to do once your training was over?
Ganyu: The training's not over yet. The part prepared by Cloud Retainer is only the first trial.
Paimon: Huh? So there are more trials, prepared by other adepti?
Traveler: Is Mountain Shaper next?
Ganyu: No. The only adeptus who can unlock my true potential is...
Paimon: Who is it?
Ganyu: Conqueror of Demons.
Paimon: Huh! So it's Xiao! That cold-hearted loner? How come he's prepared a trial for you?
Traveler: What a surprise...
Ganyu: I found him unapproachable at first, too. But I believe... that being able to face him is an important part of my "homecoming."
Ganyu: He's already waiting for me. Come along if you're interested.
Paimon: #Of course we are! Let's go, Traveler!
Traveler: How interesting...
Traveler: Is it Moon Carver?
Traveler: Being an adeptus is not easy...
Ganyu: Hardships are a fact of life, both for the adepti and humans alike.

## Talk 5

Xiao: You're half an hour late... I see you still haven't abandoned the wrongful ways of humankind.
Ganyu: I'm sorry, I had a meeting with Cloud Retainer, I...
Xiao: I don't need your explanations and don't require any mutual understanding between us. I'm just helping you with your training, that's all.
Paimon: Xiao is such a strict teacher.
Xiao: You're neither an adeptus, nor a human, always treading the line between the two worlds. It must create a lot of confusion.
Xiao: Instead of explaining yourself to me, you should face your true self.
Ganyu: I... I have nothing to hide.
Traveler: It seems that Xiao understands Ganyu quite well.
Xiao: The body and the mind are one. If something worries your mind, your body can help you find a solution.
Xiao: The trial I've prepared for you will explore the true potential of your body.
Ganyu: Yes, I'm ready.
Traveler: Xiao might be a good teacher after all.

## Talk 6

Ganyu: I've completed your trial.
Xiao: You don't have to report back to me. Seeking other people's validation won't benefit your training.
Xiao: Only you can evaluate the result of this trial. You'll progress faster that way.
Ganyu: Um... Understood.
Paimon: Xiao always has such strong opinions.
Traveler: He could be nicer while sharing them.
Xiao: From tomorrow on, I'll start raising the difficulty of your training, so you'll have to...
Xiao: ...
Paimon: Have to do what?
Xiao: Huh... Another one of those pesky visitors...
Xiao: I'll leave him to you, Ganyu. It's also a part of your training.
Paimon: Pesky visitor? So even here there are those that Xiao can't deal with?
Xin Cheng: Oh—Oh heavens! Blessed be Rex Lapis, I've finally come upon the adepti!
Xin Cheng: Are all of you the adepti of this mountain?
Xin Cheng: Great! My name's Xin Cheng. I came to ask for your merciful blessings, O adepti! I beg of you, please grant me luck, wealth, and a good career!
Paimon: Oh, so it's a pilgrim.
Traveler: Such a materialist...
Ganyu: I... am also one of the adepti. You can say that I'm an adeptus in training.
Xin Cheng: Perfect! I didn't come in vain then. Although you sound a bit half-hearted, eh... doesn't matter.
Xin Cheng: What blessings can you grant me?
Paimon: Wow, straight to the point, huh?
Ganyu: Dear... pilgrim, you shouldn't jump to conclusions. Adepti don't help every pilgrim for free.
Xin Cheng: For free? Do you mean that you charge people for the blessings of the adepti?
Ganyu: Ah, that's not what I meant. What I'm trying to say is that everything should be earned through hard work and earnest living...
Ganyu: It would be unfair to other people if you got everything you wanted for no reason.
Xin Cheng: Hold on, hold on, I've heard this all before. You're just like my old man, always nagging me...
Ganyu: Your father must've experienced it firsthand. The lives of the common folk are riddled with hardships but are also full of joy.
Ganyu: A person of your age should focus on work and family, instead of chasing after fairytales.
Xin Cheng: Are you a real adeptus? Why do you speak and behave like us city folk?
Xin Cheng: You sure you're not of those swindlers who pose as an adeptus to cheat people out of their money?
Traveler: He just can't take criticism.
Xin Cheng: Eh, enough. Doesn't matter if you're a real adeptus or not, you're useless. I'm leaving.
Paimon: Hmph! Nobody's stopping you!
Ganyu: Eh...
Paimon: Ganyu, don't let that guy ruin your mood...
Ganyu: I—It's not his behavior. The things he said... He was right.
Ganyu: I thought that coming back to Jueyun Karst and devoting myself to training would make me feel like an adeptus again.
Ganyu: But being questioned by him made me realize that I...
Traveler: Go back to Liyue Harbor with us.
Ganyu: But... I'm unwelcome in Liyue Harbor. As an adeptus, I...
Traveler: We told you it was a misunderstanding!
Paimon: It's true! Just believe us!
Ganyu: Eh...
Ganyu: Alright, I'll go with you to Liyue Harbor. That said, I still trust my initial judgment.
Ganyu: If I'm proven right, I'll return to Jueyun Karst once again.
Paimon: It's a step in the right direction. Let's go!
Traveler: Can you believe a human like me just this once?
Traveler: You're better off sticking to your human side.
Traveler: Show some respect!
Xin Cheng: Ugh... How dare you reprove me! I bet you came here looking for the adepti yourself!
Paimon: Hmm, he might sorta have a point. We did come here looking for Ganyu, after all.
Traveler: I can see why Xiao finds his type troublesome.
Paimon: Eh, he can handle any battle, but talking to strange humans is a different story, huh...
Traveler: That lone wolf is truly admirable.

## Talk 7

Cloud Retainer: This trial will test her spirit.
Cloud Retainer: Even so, one hopes that it shall trouble her little...

## Talk 8

Xiao: Focus on the trial. I'm not here for idle chatter.
