# Delicious Baklava

A traditional Sumeru dessert. A certain researcher once said that the people of Sumeru can be split into two categories. Those who eat desserts to live, and those who live to eat desserts. The thin puff pastry layers of this dish, and the bone-piercing aroma of butter and honey, may yet consign all who taste it into the second camp.
