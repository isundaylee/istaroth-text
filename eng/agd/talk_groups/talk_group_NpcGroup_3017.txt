Yukio: Poultry skewer with BBQ sauce, salty grilled fish, kitsune ramen... Dear customer, how would you like to try some native Inazuma snacks?
Yukio: We also serve tea. We have genmaicha, barley, and oolong. Which one would you like? We do not serve alcohol, though.

Traveler: No alcohol?
Yukio: Hmm, odd, is it? Well, think about it. If you drink too much, your taste buds will get numb, and you won't be able to taste how good the dishes are anymore.
Yukio: So even if most Inazuman snacks go well with alcohol, we don't serve alcohol here.
Yukio: To me, the bitterness and the aftertaste of tea can bring out the taste of the skewers and the sauce better. Alcohol would just cover everything up.
Yukio: Aside from the skewers, you might want to order some kitsune ramen if you want something more filling... Ah, by the way, you aren't allergic to beans, are you?

Traveler: Allergic to beans?
Yukio: There was a case like this before, so it's better safe than sorry for me to ask first.
Yukio: There was once an Oni gentleman and a lady with kitsune ears who made a bet here on who could eat the most kitsune ramen.
Yukio: But there was fried tofu in the ramen, and the Oni people are allergic to beans...
Yukio: Therefore, even though that gentleman with long horns won the bet, he also almost lost his life... Was it worthwhile?

Traveler: I can't drink alcohol yet.
Yukio: I see. You aren't old enough to drink, right? That's also fine. You can order some tea while savoring some of Inazuma's snacks.
Yukio: Here, these Onigiri are freshly made today. They are delicious and filling. Please have some.
