Traveler: About Ningguang
Paimon: How does a person become as rich, or as rich, or as super rich as Lady Ningguang?
Traveler: Is that the only impression she gives you? Riches?
Paimon: Well, there's the huge Jade Chamber, too! But isn't that also made of Mora?
Traveler: Well, you need an excellent mind...
Paimon: Paimon's really good at giving people nicknames!
Traveler: You need to be very familiar with the workings of the markets...
Paimon: A serving of Fisherman's Toast goes for 1025 Mora, and no discounts even on rainy days.
Traveler: You also require exceptional workmanship...
Paimon: So... how do you make friends with a really rich person?
Traveler: Wait, you're giving up already?!
