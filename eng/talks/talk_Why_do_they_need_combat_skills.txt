Traveler: Why do they need combat skills?
Maillardet: Um... Well, actually, Mr. Bossuet was against that at first, too.
Maillardet: I guess you could consider this... my personal interest?
Maillardet: See? Now that Coppelius and Coppelia have combat abilities, their dance now exudes elegance as well as power!
Maillardet: Regardless of what anyone else thinks, I believe that this was a successful attempt.
Maillardet: Of course, there was a happy accident involved... With Mr. Bossuet's departure from the Institute, there's no one left to reject my research plans!
