Traveler: We didn't do anything... No need to thank us.
Betresa: You may not know this, but Lord Bamoun and I were very close friends.
Betresa: I'm usually in charge of day-to-day matters, and after he fell ill, caring for Lord Bamoun often fell to me.
Betresa: As you see, I am hardly young myself and have lived here all my life...
Betresa: Here, we keep secrets and shoulder our duties. To put things nicely, we have our principles. To be blunter about it... We have nowhere else to go.
Betresa: Lord Bamoun and I have spent our whole lives in the desert. He was full of life and boldness in his youth, just like you, and thus became our leader.
Betresa: I sometimes feel that he was always searching for a way to better the lives of all humans.
Betresa: It was for this purpose that he obtained the Ba Fragments to protect our faith â€” the contest with you, your companions, and Sir Cyrus was part of it too.
