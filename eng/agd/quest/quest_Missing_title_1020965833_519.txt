## Talk 1

Message Board (Message): "Mr. Okazaki, when will the next shipment of Dandelion Wine arrive? Although the Sakoku Decree is very strict, given your status at the Commission, you must have a way, right?"
Message Board (Owner's Reply): Sorry, there is no such way.
Message Board (Owner's Reply): P.S: Can this type of question really be asked on a public message board like this...?

## Talk 2

Message Board (Message): "Hah! Hiromi's still as much of an idiot as ever!"

Message Board (Message): "C'mon, old man Okazaki, you've got ways and means, don'cha? Come on, give me the scoop..."
Message Board (Message): "What am I gonna do with that Sakoku scoop, you might ask? Well, I'll come right back to Ritou to settle down, and I'll run a legit business, of course!"
Message Board (Owner's Reply): Please be patient, dear customer. I believe that the days will get better.
Message Board (Owner's Reply): Ah, by the way. Hiromi left a letter and a gift again. I will safeguard them for you for the time being.

## Talk 5

Message Board (Message): "The Sakura wine and Sakura Mochi were excellent. Thank you for serving us."

## Talk 6

Message Board (Message): "The food stalls here on Narukami Island really are good. Man, if only my home had such fine taverns."
Message Board (Another Person's Message): "I know, right? Mr. Okazaki is such a friendly man. Don't see that much on Narukami at all."
Message Board (Message): "Oh, come on, don't say that. I mean, as a general (material redacted), I've met a lot of friendly people."
Message Board (Message): "Come on, do you really have to redact that nowadays!?"
Message Board (Owner's Reply): It does seem that we've been playing host to all manner of strange new customers since the ceasefire was signed...

## Talk 9

Message Board (Message): "Sorry, old man Okazaki. I had to eat my words and come back."
Message Board (Owner's Reply): Ah, come now, see what I told you? And look at you â€” you've grown quite a bit since you left, haven't you?
Message Board (Message): "The things that last are less than few, I look upon tombs to comfort find."
Message Board (Owner's Reply): "But today spring has come anew, and in its light, we leave the ice behind."

Message Board (Message): "'Good men don't brag about past valor,' Mr. Okazaki. Stop listening to my brothers when they talk about silly things!"
Message Board (Owner's Reply): Well, what is an old man to do, when you have never told any of those stories yourself?
Message Board (Message): "Haha, stop teasing me!"
