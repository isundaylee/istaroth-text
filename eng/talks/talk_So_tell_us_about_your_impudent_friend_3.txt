# Talk Dialog

Traveler: So, tell us about your impudent friend...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Boethius... He was not always evil. He was once a noble Harmost of Remuria, and the sole survivor of the catastrophe that befell us.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): The original purpose of the golden castellum was to unify our surviving kin and prevent the catastrophe of the rising waters from ever occurring again. But evidently, Boethius had his own designs...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): While I and my companions ranged across the land, struggling mightily to contain the power of the primordial waters, he used his eloquent tongue to sway those who remained.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): He initiated a fell ritual that aimed to restore the shattered "symphony" and revive the ruined realm. To this end, he did not hesitate to dissolve the will of our kin and plunder the souls of Fontainians everywhere.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Many rulers and nobles became his pawns, and polities newly-born lay on the brink of destruction.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): To stop him, who had by now clearly become a monster, I could only forsake my name and become one who hunts phantoms, resisting him alongside the Fontainians.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Bitter was the conflict before we were at last able to seal both him and the sea that had devoured our nation.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): I swore upon fate that I would serve as the barrier between past and present. Thus did I become the spirit-keeper of our ancient land.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): I had thought that even if evil lingered in him, his soul had long been broken, and he would remain naught but discordant notes, a "symphony" plunged into strife.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): I never thought that he would weave his shattered self into the "symphony" and thus gain mastery over it. The discord and dissonance that now emanate from these waters can be regarded as an extension of his power.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): If we are to defeat him... I fear we must await the moment when all his soul fragments have gathered around one body.
