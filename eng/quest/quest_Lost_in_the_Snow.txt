# Lost in the Snow


## Talk 1

Joel: Where has Daddy gone...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Joel: Ah, I... Hello... I—I can't find my daddy...
Joel: He said that he would come to pick me up and that we'd go see the snow together. But the time we arranged has come and gone, and he isn't here yet...
Joel: I thought that he must have found some rare and precious treasure map or something, which is why he hasn't come to find me yet. That has to be it, right?
Joel: So I came to Dragonspine by myself. If he's not going to come find me, then I'll go looking for him... Or so I thought...
Joel: But I didn't find Daddy here, either. That Knight of Favonius over there said that he'd headed off for the mountain's summit...
Joel: I wanted to go search for him, but the Knight wouldn't let me. So I'm stuck here waiting for Daddy to come back.
Joel: But... but he hasn't come back at all, and I'm worried.
Joel: If you're going up Dragonspine, could you help me look for Daddy?
Traveler: Leave it to me, kiddo.
Joel: You'll do it? Great!
Joel: Let me think... That Knight said that Daddy did mention going to follow the *Snow-Covered Path upwards* first...
Joel: He then said that he'd head over to the *Outskirts of the Entombed City* to have a look, before trying for the *mountain's summit*...
Joel: Please help me to search these areas. Daddy might still be near one of them.
Joel: I mean, he promised that we'd go see the snow together. There's no way that he'd break his promise...
Traveler: Where should I look?

## Talk 2

Neatly-Written Note: So far, so smooth. The weather is fine, supplies are plentiful, and the monsters have been on their best behavior...
Neatly-Written Note: I also discovered a copy of Volume 6 of "The Boar Princess" in my backpack. Joel must've sneaked it in there. That cheeky kid...
Neatly-Written Note: Still, this book is about a brave Boar Princess and her journey up a snowy mountain with her companions... Well, I'm heading up a snowy mountain myself, and considering how well everything's gone so far... Who knows? Maybe this book is bringing me good luck. Thank you, Joel.
Neatly-Written Note: Anyway, I shall be heading off to the next campsite to resupply and record my progress, and then I'll head down the mountain. Joel is waiting for me, after all.

## Talk 3

Neatly-Written Note: Nothing untoward happened on the way here. The weather remains fine indeed. It seems that my luck has turned at last.
Neatly-Written Note: Perhaps I can make a run for the summit after all...
Neatly-Written Note: I'll just give it a little go. If anything happens, I'll turn back right away.

## Talk 4

Scribbled Note: The snowstorm from the summit came too quickly. I barely had enough time to duck into this cave. I lost half my supplies in the chaos, too...
Scribbled Note: I don't know why, either, but the rocks above the cave collapsed suddenly, sealing the entrance with the falling gravel. This is very bad...
Scribbled Note: But... I believe that there's another way out for me. The other end of this cave is a cliff, yes, but there's nothing below but thick snow. If I try climbing a certain distance down and then jumping the rest of the way...
Scribbled Note: My supplies won't last more than a few more days. I have to act soon...
Scribbled Note: I promised Joel that I'd take him to see the snow. I won't break that promise.
Scribbled Note: Oh, yes. If anyone sees these notes, please put some food into that feeding bowl for those foxes.
Scribbled Note: They kept me company the entire time I was trapped in here. If I get the chance, I'd love to bring Joel back here to see them...

## Talk 5

Joel: How did it go? Any news from Daddy?
Traveler: Here's what we discovered in the cavern at the summit...
Joel: Daddy... No, that can't be. Daddy's a great adventurer! He'd get out of a small rough patch like this for sure.
Joel: He said that he'd found a way down the mountain in his notes, didn't he? He must've made it down safely. That's gotta be it.
Traveler: I suppose he made it down safely...
Joel: Exactly. He must've! He might even be resting right now.
Joel: Or... he might have set up a new campsite at the summit, and is taking a break there right now...
Joel: Whatever the case, I'm sure that once he's all rested up, Daddy will come here and look for me...
Joel: I'll keep waiting for him here. Thanks for helping me out, by the way. Here, these are for you.
Traveler: I didn't find anything.
Joel: R—Really? But that Knight of Favonius said that Daddy did go up the mountain.
Joel: Maybe he was mistaken... Or maybe Daddy set up a new campsite elsewhere...
Joel: Well, guess I'll just wait here for him... I bet Daddy would be worried sick if he came home and couldn't find me.
Joel: Thanks for helping me out. Here, take these.
Joel: Where are you, Daddy...
