# Friends of Fire and Water


## Talk 1

Paimon: Missing text (4183046834)

## Talk 2

Paimon: Sure enough, there are still some Saurians locked up here...
Paimon: Who'd have thought they'd persist in their wicked ways and keep hurting Saurians, even after we destroyed their base...
Paimon: Had we known, we could've chased them down and wiped them all out.
Traveler: Well, they're all done for now.
Paimon: True. Now let's save 'em, quick!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: Yes, I should've been cold and cruel back then!
Paimon: #Paimon can hardly imagine you being like that, Traveler... Anyway, let's help 'em first!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Hmm? Why are there Saurians in the cages here?
Paimon: Something's not right here... Wait. Could they all have been captured by those people?
Paimon: Have we busted some kinda Saurian trafficking ring without even realizing it?
Traveler: Wonderful! Villains vanquished, by the by!
Paimon: That's right! Now let's get all these Saurians outta here!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: Doesn't matter. We took those villains out either way.
Paimon: C'mon, it matters a lot — that the kidnapped Saurians can now regain their freedom, that is. Let's help them, pronto!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Wait, there's a... Blubberbeast in here? How in the world—? Guess bad guys really will sell anything...
Weakened Blubberbeast (Victimized Blubberbeast): Awrr... Bluboo!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rroo... Mrrooh!
Paimon: #Huh? You're kinda interested in the Blubberbeast, aren't you, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}?
Black Screen Text: #{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} listens intently to the cries of the Blubberbeast and, seemingly understanding something, lifts the creature by the tail to take it over to the shallows, where they play together.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Traveler: The Blubberbeast seems chuffed.
Paimon: Sure does! Maybe they can become friends?
Paimon: But that Blubberbeast doesn't seem to have the slightest bit of strength, and its two... Err, paws...? Either way, they don't seem able to flap around much.
Paimon: There wasn't even a plate of food around... Perhaps they've been locked up so long that they're starving.
Paimon: #If that's so, let's make something for the Blubberbeast and {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} to eat!
Traveler: #{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} seems pretty happy, too.

## Talk 5

Paimon: We said we were going to cook, but what exactly should we make?
Paimon: Blubberbeasts live in the water, so it must eat fish, right? Let's do a fish dish, then.
Paimon: #If we want the Blubberbeast and {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} to eat well... Natlan's special Grilled Fish in Mint Sauce might be a pretty good choice.
Traveler: That's practically a specialty of mine.
Traveler: Can't say I've perfected it, but no problem.
Paimon: Alright, let's get started then. Paimon will give you some pointers while you're at it!
Traveler: Make deeper cuts.
Traveler: Make shallower cuts.
Paimon: That's right! The deeper the cuts, the deeper the flavor seeps in!
Traveler: A little extra salt, a little extra happiness!
Traveler: The flavor's great as-is. No need for any salt.
Paimon: Not bad. It should keep the flavor light while maintaining the original fishiness — which the Blubberbeast is sure to love.
Paimon: #Mmm, that sure tastes rich. {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} and the Blubberbeast are going to love it!
Traveler: Mint sauce. The more, the merrier.
Traveler: Will an aquatic animal like the Blubberbeast be afraid of mint?
Paimon: Yup. We've still got other seasonings, so we don't have to go so heavy on the salt.
Paimon: Hehe, that refreshing, cool taste is going to be awesome!
Traveler: Chili peppers are indispensable.
Traveler: Animals from Fontaine might be allergic to spicy food...
Paimon: That's not how that works. A Blubberbeast is going to find the surface dry and hot, so adding a little mint sauce ought to help it cool down, right?
Paimon: Just the right amount of spiciness — enough to whet the appetite!
Traveler: Flame-grilled over scorching heat — crispy on the outside, tender on the inside!
Traveler: Slow roasted — tender and juicy!
Paimon: But it'd feel like something is missing if there's no chili at all, so why not add just a little?
Paimon: Heehee, that sounds so delicious, Paimon's drooling already.
Paimon: Hehe, nice, it's your special grilled fish. Maybe we can sell it on the streets in the future!
Black Screen Text: #After a splendid culinary process, the special fish you grilled for {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]} and the Blubberbeast is ready...

## Talk 6

Paimon: Here comes something yummy! Don't just play around — you have to replenish your energy, too.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Weakened Blubberbeast: A... Aooouhh!
Paimon: Hehe, looks like they're having a great time. Will you choke if you eat upside down like that, though...?
Traveler: Stay safe. Don't be like that Blubberbeast.
Traveler: Try it yourself and you'll see.
Paimon: Hey, what's with that patronizing tone? Paimon's no Blubberbeast. She's not gonna be so silly as to eat like that.
Paimon: Hey! Paimon's not gonna eat like that — she isn't a Blubberbeast anyway!
Black Screen Text: The Blubberbeast seems to have recovered enough strength for it to flap over and tumble into the sea...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Mmm... Aourgh!
Weakened Blubberbeast (Now-Healthy Blubberbeast): Aohh! Woo... Arr!
Paimon: Ah, it's gone...
Traveler: That's just how things are. I mean, it's not indigenous to Natlan.
Traveler: Best if it goes back where it belongs.
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rrooh...
Paimon: #Don't be sad, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}. You had so much fun just now, and you're already friends!
Paimon: Anyway, Paimon's got a feeling that this isn't the last we've seen of that Blubberbeast!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Weakened Blubberbeast: Aouhhh...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Arawr?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Awwrr...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Weakened Blubberbeast: Aouh?
Weakened Blubberbeast: Aouh...
Weakened Blubberbeast: Auh!
Paimon: Paimon can't understand their conversation at all, but it seems they've reached an understanding...?
Traveler: It's fine if you don't get it.
Paimon: Makes sense. Even though the Blubberbeast doesn't have much strength, it feels like they're really happy — and Paimon feels happy for 'em, too!
Traveler: As long as the emotion's there, that's all that matters.
