Tu: Well, well, look at you, staring agape this way and that. First time here at The Chasm? Want the mining superstar, Brother Tu himself, to show you around?

Traveler: Brother Tu?
Tu: That's right, and that's me. I've been here a long time, and I'm a pretty strong guy, so I'm loved and respected by all, to be sure!

Traveler: Mining superstar?
Tu: That's right! It's a nickname everyone gave me. A sign of affection, I'm sure. I mean, I did dig up ten tons of ore in one day that one time!
Tu: From then on, everyone started calling me the mining superstar.
Tu: It's just a shame that The Chasm's been sealed up. If not, the others would all be around for you to ask. Trust me, they'll all know who I am.

Tu: Anyway, allow me to let you in on a secret.
Tu: Rex Lapis is actually still alive. Not only that, he'll definitely come to settle this whole mess here in The Chasm.

Traveler: !?
Tu: #Hehe, stunning news, eh? Lemme tell you something: his Exuvia has actually transformed into some blond-haired young man!
Tu: And with another part of his adeptal powers, he turned into some sort of adeptal fruit that can get angry and even sneeze. They're still going around Liyue resolving all manner of calamities, even today, protecting us all.

### Talk 5 related talk 1

Traveler: Who told you that?
Tu: I... I figured it out myself. I mean, I've been here so long and I don't have any other hobbies, so what I do is put the various things I hear together.
Tu: You see, Rex Lapis' passing and the appearance of that Traveler followed closely after each other.
Tu: And so I thought, could this just be another one of the Lord of Geo's incognito travels?
Tu: I'm not intending to grab here, but I reckon that this is a most rational explanation, by yours truly no less!

Traveler: See you.
Tu: Eh? You're not interested? Come on, I wasn't bragging or anything, y'know?

Traveler: #A blond-haired young man...?
Tu: #Ooh, interested, are we? Then let me tell you something else, something that I've only told a couple of people. You know the Traveler named Traveler who's been active all over the world lately? This person's actually Rex Lapis himself!
Tu: Huh... You're not surprised? Hang on a moment... blond hair, and a talking adeptal fruit...
Tu: Wait, are you that Traveler?

### Talk 6 related talk 1

Traveler: Adeptal fruit...?
Tu: That's right, they say that this adeptal fruit was created from the very essence of the adeptal energies of heaven and earth themselves. If a mortal were to eat it, they would be granted great longevity, and power enough to fell a bull in a single punch!
Tu: Of course, I don't know if that's true or not, but I'd sure like to have a bite and see what it tastes like.

Traveler: That's right, that's me, and here's my adeptal fruit Paimon.
Tu: Ah, so that rumor about the Traveler was true! And here I thought that Muning was just boasting...
Tu: Well, looks like there's hope for the situation in The Chasm now...
