Traveler: If your information is so valuable, why not work for yourself?
Lasselin: I... I'm afraid of trouble, and working in this tavern is great! Really great. It's safe, comfortable, and there are even free drinks!
Lasselin: But most importantly, as long as I'm here then no one will dare come bother me, and I won't be forced to go bother anyone else...
Lasselin: Anyway, if you really want to buy "good wine," then please speak with the helmsman.
