Traveler: Children?
Matzil: Yup! These chubby little guys are pretty cute, don'cha think?

Traveler: Totally understandable.
Matzil: Yes. Just as people meow whenever they see a kitten, I can't help but call out to a Saurian whelp whenever I see one.
Matzil: Once they're a bit bigger, I can ride an adult Saurian and bring the kids along for a joyride.
Matzil: As they grow older, they begin to develop unique character traits and will choose the rider they identify with most.
Matzil: So the time when little Saurians follow you about innocently should be cherished.
