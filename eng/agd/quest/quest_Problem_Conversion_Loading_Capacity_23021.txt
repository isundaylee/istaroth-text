# Problem Conversion: Loading Capacity


## Talk 1

Rafiq: Traveler! You're just in time. I just launched the ship. It's steady as she goes, as they say.
Rafiq: My calculation worked out perfectly, just as I thought!
Qishan: So, when do we start this load test?
Rafiq: Let's not rush. The Traveler is here, so we may start soon.
Traveler: What's a load test?
Rafiq: In a nutshell, we test the load capacity of the ship using heavy objects.
Rafiq: This means that someone is going to have to move the stuff onto the ship with me.
Rafiq: And you, Traveler, as I observed previously, are most able-bodied. Surely such a gig is a piece of cake to you...
Traveler: Oh, so that's why you asked me to come here, eh?
Rafiq: Well... Ugh, I can't do this on my own, so I could only ask you to help out.
Rafiq: There will be generous rewards, I promise! I just helped a guy fix his large ship days ago. It was a pretty well-paying job, too!
Qishan: Well paid, you say...
Rafiq: Eh? Uh, well, I did spend nearly all that Mora on the ship...
Qishan: Nearly all?
Rafiq: I still have some left! Don't worry, I can still buy you some coffee...
Rafiq: Well then, Traveler, let's get this started! To the ship!
Traveler: Oh, now I'm slightly annoyed.

## Talk 2

Qishan: Huh? Is this ship really capable of carrying such heavy things...

## Talk 3

Rafiq: Alright! That should be it. Let's see what will happen...
Paimon: Whoa! The ship's sprung a leak over there!
Rafiq: What!?
Paimon: The ship is tilting! What's going on?
Rafiq: Move the stuff off now! Something's gone wrong!
Black Screen Text: You rid the ship of heavy items together with Rafiq in a hurry...
Rafiq: Whew... We're lucky that there weren't too many things to move.
Rafiq: What the... Where did I go wrong?
Qishan: What did I say? The theoretical data you used is too extreme to be reliable.
Rafiq: *sigh* I... I... Fine.
Rafiq: This shouldn't have happened... I did my calculations with so much precision!
Rafiq: Thanks for your help, Traveler. Please take this as compensation for your trouble.
Rafiq: I'll go back and redo my calculations. Qishan, could you help me with them?
Qishan: You say it like I wasn't already helping before...
Qishan: Just leave it to me, and remember to buy me coffee after this.

## Talk 4

Rafiq: Yes! It worked out!
Rafiq: There are no structural problems with the hull... The waterline is stable, too. No tipping.
Rafiq: Look, Qishan, my design and calculations are immaculate!
Qishan: Don't get carried away. We're just at phase one of the load test.
Qishan: And you haven't even taken into account the center of gravity shift that will occur on the ship due to weather and cargo as it navigates.
Rafiq: Ugh... I'll consider those factors. But please, just let me enjoy this moment.
Rafiq: Oh, Traveler, this is your payment. Please take it.
Rafiq: Qishan, can't you just be happy for me once?
Qishan: But being happy for you isn't going to help you build the ship.
Qishan: Best you try to make your wallet happy instead.

## Talk 5

Rafiq: The load capacity of this ship is out of the question! Don't worry!
