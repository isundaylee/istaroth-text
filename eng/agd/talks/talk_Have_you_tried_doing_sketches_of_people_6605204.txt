Traveler: Have you tried doing sketches of people?
Kuhimana: In all honesty, I've tried. But I couldn't even sort the labels out correctly, let alone still recognize them the second time we met...
Kuhimana: Sometimes, there'll be two people who were wearing hats of a similar color, and I'll accidentally sort them into the same book.
Kuhimana: As time has gone by, everyone who knows me knows I have this issue, so they don't take it personally when I fail to recognize them.
Kuhimana: On the contrary, they're all quite happy to have someone like me around who's good at telling animals apart.
Kuhimana: In their eyes, all animals of any given species look exactly the same! Boggles the mind, doesn't it?
