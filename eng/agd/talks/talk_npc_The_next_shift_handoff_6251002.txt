Traveler: The next shift... handoff?
Sergeant Lin: This is confidential information concerning Millelith defenses, and I'm not at liberty to discuss this.
Sergeant Lin: Still, I do sense that you're as extraordinary as you are upright... You must be someone truly great.
Sergeant Lin: Would you be interested in joining one of our Millelith support units and contributing to the safety and prosperity of Liyue?
