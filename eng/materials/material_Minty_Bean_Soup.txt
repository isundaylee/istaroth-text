# Minty Bean Soup

A rich soup made with simple ingredients. Mints and beans were boiled and ground together to get a smooth texture. The soup was then left on low heat till it thickened. Finally, some beans and mints were sprinkled on the top. This refreshing delicacy tastes equally good whether served hot or cold.
