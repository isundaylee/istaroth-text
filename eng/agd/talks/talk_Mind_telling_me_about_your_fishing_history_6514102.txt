Traveler: Mind telling me about your fishing history?
Daniaud: A friend introduced the hobby to me. At first, I thought it to be quite boring â€” I mean, what else could you call an activity that tests one's patience?
Daniaud: But my friend just waved his hand in a mysterious way, claiming that fishing itself could not encompass the whole hobby.
Daniaud: Just as reading a book could open you to other experiences beyond its contents, he said.
Daniaud: For example, one might consider and analyze the story's backdrop, listen to comments from other readers, view other work derived from the text, and so on.
Daniaud: And the truth has borne his statement out quite nicely, I feel. The simple thought of what I might fish up this time is already very fascinating to me.
