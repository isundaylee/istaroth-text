# Festival Utsava


## Talk 1

Paimon: We're back, Araja!
Araja: Finally! Everyone's been waiting!
Arama: Festival Utsava has started, but it's not in full swing yet since Nara friends didn't get back till now.
Traveler: There are so many Aranara here.
Paimon: #It's been a real grind adventuring like this huh. Let's just enjoy the festivities right now, {NICKNAME}!
Arama: #Yes, you must enjoy yourselves, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon.
Araja: Yes. I'll see you later.
Traveler: Can we prepare the Bija once the festival is over?
Araja: As far as I know, yes.

## Talk 2

Arakavi: Hey, it's the Golden Nara! Perfect timing!
Traveler: #My name is {NICKNAME}...
Arakavi: Gold is a wonderful color, the same as sunshine. That's what I'd like to call you on this important occasion!
Arasudraka: #Regardless, your name shall be recorded in our songs. Nara {NICKNAME} is a good name, very lyrical!
Aradasa: ♪~
Arayasa: #"The {M#boy}{F#girl} whose eyes and soul are as golden as the sun, thy name is Nara {NICKNAME}."
Paimon: Hey, what about Paimon? Don't forget Paimon now!
Arayasa: "The pearl in moonlight, pure as silver, thy name is Paimon..."
Paimon: Yes, Paimon wants to hear more! Maybe something that lauds our friendship too...
Traveler: Back to the topic...
Arama: #Nara {NICKNAME}! Paimon!
Araja: You're here! Everybody's having a great time at the festival.
Paimon: #It's always nice to have someone to help out and play with, right, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: That's right!
Arama: #No, not in that way! We're happy because we made friends with Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon.
Arama: Although Aranakin, Aranaga, and Aragaru don't remember you, the forest does. The story will live on.
Araja: Yeah, the singing of a Nara friend with Aranara is the most important part of the festival in the story! Song gatherers, are you ready?
Aradasa: ♪~
Arayasa: "From the first cry after birth, this is the moment you've been preparing for..."
Arasudraka: Stupid Arayasa, only baby Nara are born and would cry.
Arakavi: We're ready! And so is the ancient "stage" where it will take place!
Arakavi: It was Aramuhukunda before me, and there will be other song gatherers after me to make it grow. It's been waiting for a long time to hear the duet between Nara and Aranara again.
Araja: #I'm very much looking forward to it as well. Are you ready, Nara {NICKNAME}?
Paimon: #According to how it was done before, you should be playing instruments too, right? Paimon can't wait for your performance, {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: I'm ready.
Araja: Don't worry, just use the instrument you're used to and play it at your own pace.
Arakavi: Well then, Golden Nara, we shall sing together! Please take the lead!
Arama: #Go, Nara {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: I'm a bit nervous...
Arama: #Huh. Even someone as mighty as Nara {NICKNAME} can get nervous?
Traveler: Oh.
Traveler: (Wait for more.)
Arayasa: "Gold and silver, the colors of the sun and moon, are the reflection of their friendship."
Paimon: Not bad! Adding a few lines praising Paimon's wisdom would be nice, too!
Traveler: Let's not digress further...
Traveler: (Wait for more.)
Arayasa: "The paths of stars, of flowing water, are all an open aranyaka to the silver one. The riddle is the moonlight's bait, the wisdom is the pearl's glimmer."
Paimon: Very poetic! Y'know, Paimon's also very brave... sooo, get Paimon's drift?
Traveler: That's enough, Paimon.
Traveler: (Wait for more.)
Arayasa: ...
Arayasa: "Swelling like a specter, surging ahead like a boar..."
Paimon: Hey, who are you calling a Specter? What a letdown!
Traveler: Don't you know my name?

## Talk 3

Black Screen Text: The Aranara disperse following the duet.
Paimon: Wow, that was great! Your playing and the Aranara song were both awesome!
Arasudraka: #Yeah, Nara {NICKNAME} is awesome! I'd love to travel with you and remember your songs!
Traveler: Thanks.
Arakavi: #Such a radiant melody. How exciting! Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon, and your song... What an epic tale!
Traveler: Not calling me "Golden Nara" anymore?
Arakavi: I'm short on experience, but if the stories were true, the glow from Nara Varuna's song might have been dimmer than yours!
Aradasa: ♪~
Arakavi: #Aradasa is right. Please take these as tokens of our appreciation, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon.
Paimon: Whoa, this is a lot of flowers...
Arayasa: "Even though the horizon is so gray, it's such a blessing to meet you..."
Aradasa: "...Singing your song forever is the pact between you and me."
Traveler: Thank you. I'll cherish your gift.
Aradasa: ♪~
Arakavi: #Thank you, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon.
Paimon: Paimon guesses that Festival Utsava is coming to an end...
Traveler: And we're one step closer to getting the Bija.
Paimon: We should ask Araja what to do next... Hey, where did Araja and Arama go?
Arakavi: Oh, they went that way after the duet.
Traveler: Let's go over there.
Arasudraka: #I do want to tell Nara {NICKNAME} that...
Arasudraka: #Arasudraka has learned why Nara {NICKNAME} entered Vanarana. Your and Arana's friend will be fine.
Arasudraka: Also, no matter how dark the sky and land get, as long as your spirit emits warmth like a golden sun, there will always be hope.
Traveler: I understand. Thank you.
Paimon: #Don't worry, Arasudraka! {NICKNAME} has always been like that!
Paimon: We'll get going now. Farewell!
Arasudraka: Farewell!
Traveler: Gotcha.
Traveler: Thank you, and farewell.
Traveler: Finally, light at the end of the tunnel.
Traveler: We must help Rana.
Traveler: I accept your gift.
Traveler: It's a good thing that no Whopperflowers showed up.
Traveler: Aranara are very impressive.

## Talk 4

Aranishat: Aralila, Nara have a incantation to find Nara in hiding. It goes like this: "Curry, curry in the air~ Hungry children it's time to come home~♪"
Aralila: But what's curry?
Aranishat: Oh, I don't know. But I heard little Nara will come when they hear this incantation! So, you can try it if you're looking for little Nara!

## Talk 5

Araesha: Festival Utsava will have Araesha's tasty riddles, which are also sweet and fragrant! I heard that Nara like sweet and fragrant things...
Araesha: So you'll love this sweet and fragrant Festival Utsava, right, Nara?

## Talk 6

Arakanta: Thank you, Nara! Arakanta is so happy!

## Talk 7

Arakavi: #Oh? It's Nara {NICKNAME}! We learned many lost tunes thanks to you, Paimon, and Arama.
Arakavi: You're well acquainted with the art of singing, right?
Traveler: I'm alright, I guess...
Arakavi: Then please... What was the Nara phrase again? "Let me borrow your ears"... or something like that.
Traveler: I think you meant "lend me your ears."
Arakavi: Is that how it's supposed to be? Eh, anyway, let's meet again later!
Traveler: "Cover your ears?"
Traveler: I'm amazing.
Traveler: I might attract Whopperflowers...
Arakavi: #Hahaha, Nara {NICKNAME}'s really funny.

## Talk 8

Arayasa: #"Even if you cover {M#her}{F#his} eyes in gloom, you can't take away the light from {M#her}{F#his} heart..."

## Talk 9

Aradasa: ♪~

## Talk 10

Arasudraka: #You're back, Nara {NICKNAME}! A Festival Utsava with you is a tale fit for songs!

## Talk 11

Araja: Oh my, I'm so touched...

## Talk 12

Arakavi: Golden Nara, we shall sing together! Please take the lead!

## Talk 13

Arasudraka: May this song echo in Vanarana forever!

## Talk 14

Arapacati: Nara's "taste of happiness" is so strange... But since Nara is happy, Arapacati and her brothers shall be happy too!
Arasaka: The "taste of happiness" is good, of course. B—But it's not just about the sugar.
Arachatora: The Head Mushroom helped too! The Head Mushroom I've always dreamed about! Its aroma... Ahh!
Araphala: And don't... don't forget about the Unrivaled Fresh Fruit...
Arapas: Water from Vanarana too! Soup with "the taste of happiness" can only be made with the best water!

## Talk 15

Arakavi: *sigh* This is great...

## Talk 16

Arama: Actually, I've been wanting to ask you something. Why do Nara sleep?
Traveler: Because it brings us comfort.
Arama: I see! Aranara "hibernate" only when a great, great danger is present. We turn into tiny seeds and go into dreamless slumbers.
Arama: But we will be isolated from others, and that's rather scary. Not to mention having to accumulate a lot of memories to change back into our previous forms...
Arama: But you Nara are different. You must sleep often, and that's the only way you can dream. Dreams are precious, so I understand... But it is strange. You have had very few dreams lately, big Nara...
Arama: Regardless, you can sleep here without worries. We will guard your dreams and stop bad things like Vanagni from getting in.
Paimon: Sounds good, but...
Paimon: Gah, you and your mentions of dreams... Paimon almost feels like meeting you and spending the festival with you might just all be a dream Paimon had after eating those mushrooms, and that all this will vanish once Paimon wakes up...
Paimon: Will we still see you when we wake up?
Arama: Of course!
Traveler: Good night, Paimon.
Paimon: Good night!
Traveler: See you tomorrow, Arama.
Arama: Farewell!
Traveler: I don't know. I think sleeping is a waste of time.
Paimon: #Eh? Don't you think sleep is pretty comfortable, {NICKNAME}?

## Talk 17

Aragaru: Hehe, Festival Utsava, so lively! Vanarana is filled with joy!
Aranakin: But Festival Utsava will end. Nara friends of Aranara might leave too.
Traveler: The forest will remember.
Aranaga: The forest will remember, but...
Aragaru: I pray that no wind shall blow away our happiness; that there shall be rain to wet the earth and keep our Nara friends a while longer...

## Talk 18

Ararycan: #Thank you, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon, for coming to Vanarana and celebrating Festival Utsava with us Aranara.
Ararycan: Ararycan wants to spend more time together with you, good friends...

## Talk 19

Araja: Oh my, I am so happy! I hope you will be happy too. Our greatest wish during Festival Utsava is to see our Nara friends happy.
Araja: Nara time is much more precious than Aranara time, so I will not keep you from enjoying yourselves. Go look for Arakavi later. He is also preparing for the Festival Utsava ceremony.

## Talk 20

Arama: #Yes! You will be fine, Nara {NICKNAME}! Hearing your song gives us courage to even face Marana!

## Talk 21

Arapandu: The last time we had such a lively Festival Utsava was when Nara Varuna came to Vanarana...
Arabalika: The festival may be fun, but nothing lasts forever.
Arakunti: Just like how Nilotpala Lotuses in the water never stay in bloom. They must always close sometime.

## Talk 22

Aranakula: #This feels just like the time Nara Varuna celebrated Festival Utsava with Aranara all over again... Aranakula hasn't been so happy in a very long time, Nara {NICKNAME}. *sob*
Arakara: Viparyas hate tears. Festival Utsava is a happy festival. Aranakula will play a happy song for Viparyas!

## Talk 23

Aradasa: ♪~

## Talk 24

Arayasa: "This is our song..."

## Talk 25

Arama: The last Festival Utsava took place during Nara Varuna's time! In many tales and recollections, Marana was everywhere back then.
Arama: Trees died, and lush plains turned brown. It rained filthy red water... Red, not the lovely apple red. Very horrifying!
Araja: I'm glad I don't remember it now. Many children returned to Sarva before they were done growing into Vasara Trees. But there was still Nara Varuna and Festival Utsava.
Arama: Yes. At the time, you must have been a young Aranara sapling like me!
Araja: #Right. I have lost a lot of memories, but still can recall Nara's tears. Salty drops fell from {M#her}{F#his} eyes, but I wasn't afraid.
Araja: #{M#She}{F#He} spoke to me at length about our adventures in the forest, and thus the tales were preserved. Then, {M#she}{F#he} left.
Araja: #I wonder where {M#she}{F#he} is now? {M#She}{F#He} was very much like you, Nara {NICKNAME}. You two might be Nara, but you are shining like the warm, golden sun.
Arama: Drifting seeds are destined to flourish on nice soil... same for Nara! One day, the wind in Nara's hearts will stop, halting their steps.
Arama: #But Nara {NICKNAME} is not like ordinary Nara. Nara {NICKNAME} will keep traveling, and will perhaps run into Nara Varuna someday!
Araja: Yes, but you forgot, Arama, that Nara are not Aranara. Their time is short.
Araja: Nara Varuna couldn't live as long as trees, nor share dreams and memories as we do. How lonely and lamentable the Nara are.
Arama: #...Right. If only Nara {NICKNAME} were an Aranara! If so, we would've known each other from way before and shared so many memories.
Araja: The forest will remember. I'll bring all of Vanarana's memories to meet Aramuhukunda in Sarva, like rivers converging into the sea.
Araja: A very long time ago, Vanarana was destroyed in that Nara catastrophe. Since then, Aranara made dreams their home and distanced themselves from Nara.
Araja: Only Nara Varuna has always been friends with Aranara and continued helping everyone after the destruction. Only then did Aranara trust Nara again, little by little.
Araja: #When we parted, {M#she}{F#he} told me that, maybe one day, another Golden Nara would come to us, and {M#he}{F#she} would bring us even better memories.
Araja: #I think that with you and Nara {NICKNAME}, perhaps it's time for us to walk, sing, and play with Nara in the forests once again.
Arama: #But everybody trusts Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon because they're genuinely good. It wouldn't be a problem if all Nara are nice like Nara {NICKNAME} and Nara Varuna!
Arama: You sound like an old Nara, Araja!
Araja: Oh, I'm very happy to have the festival and give the flowers to the Golden Nara, but I'm also reminded of a lot of other things...
Paimon: Arama, Araja! What are you doing here?
Paimon: #Don't tell Paimon you ran away because you didn't like how {NICKNAME} played?
Arama: #No! Nara {NICKNAME}'s performance was a bright ray of sunshine. It felt very, very good.
Arama: #But the Bija is crucial to Arana's and Nara {NICKNAME}'s wish, so I had to get ready.
Paimon: Oh yeah, the Bija...
Traveler: Right!
Arama: I went looking for the Fane of Ashvattha right after the song ended.
Paimon: That sounds like it had something to do with the concourses we visited before.
Araja: Paimon is as bright as moonlight. That's where Ashvattha's Tree of Dreams is. It's an ancient, sturdy Vasara Tree that's able to produce Bija.
Araja: However, I don't remember the location, nor am I able to leave Vanarana's dream, so it's all up to Arama to find it.
Arama: #Worry not. Like Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon would say, "I got this!"
Traveler: You got this!
Paimon: Paimon's confused. You said that you can't leave, Araja. Can't you go to places in a jiffy like Arama?
Araja: I've been limited to moving only in Vanarana's dreams since a long, long time ago.
Araja: A "Tree of Dreams" is required to anchor a dream this big, and I became that tree so everyone would have a home.
Paimon: How can this be...
Araja: What's the matter, Paimon? It's a good thing for me to house so many big dreams and be with everyone.
Arama: Yeah, I want to be a great Aranara like Araja when I grow up, hosting many dreams like a tree with many leaves!
Traveler: Aranara have a different way of thinking...
Paimon: Uh... Paimon gets it...
Paimon: Well, that eccentric Aranara we met before also said that Bija is yielded from the extraction of memories and dreams.
Paimon: Is that true? Can Aranara lose their memory?
Araja: That's probably the case... but I can no longer recall it now.
Paimon: ...
Traveler: So what should we do now?
Arama: #You got a lot of flowers during the festival, right, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon?
Paimon: Not just during the festival! We got some from Aranakin, Aragaru, and Aranaga too...
Paimon: Paimon wishes they could remember all the adventures we had together...
Arama: Don't worry, no memories will be lost! The forest will remember, just like the rivers emptying into the sea, before being turned into the rain splashing down unto the earth.
Arama: #Give me all the flowers, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon!
Traveler: Okay.
Paimon: They're mementos of Aranara's friendship and are precious to us. What do you need them for, Arama?
Arama: I'm putting my flowers and theirs together!
Paimon: Since you put it that way, Arama...
Black Screen Text: You hand Arama all of the flowers.
Black Screen Text: Arama weaves a garland out of the flowers, including its own, and puts it on your head.
Paimon: This is...
Araja: #Oh, it's so pretty. It looks great on you, Nara {NICKNAME}!
Araja: This garland represents the blessings that we Aranara, as well as all of Vanarana, want to bestow upon our favorite Nara.
Araja: Unlike you Nara, we Aranara can communicate in our dreams.
Araja: Any sadness can be shared among all Aranara to soften its blow, and we share our joys as well.
Arama: #When Nara {NICKNAME} wears the garland, we'll be able to share the load on your mind, and we can protect you when you have nightmares.
Traveler: Thank you.
Arama: #I should be thanking you, Nara {NICKNAME}, for accepting our flowers! That gives us greater joy than soaking in the sun, drinking sweet water, and dreaming nice things.
Paimon: Paimon wants a garland too!
Araja: I doubt that's necessary.
Paimon: Huh? Why not?
Arama: #Nara {NICKNAME} will be facing many great dangers and experiencing great sadness. We can ward off some of {M#his}{F#her} nightmares through the garland.
Arama: #On the other hand, Nara {NICKNAME} will protect Paimon from nightmares. You will always be together and will share both joy and sorrow.
Paimon: That's right. We're the best of friends, after all!
Traveler: So what should we do now?
Arama: We're going to offer the Vasoma Fruit at the Fane of Ashvattha. Then we can produce the Bija with Arana!
Arama: I have studied you Nara before. Unlike Aranara, you have to "sleep" when the moon is up, and you come out only after the sun has risen.
Arama: #Would you like to sleep, Nara {NICKNAME} and Paimon?
Paimon: Now that you mention it, Paimon's pretty bushed from all the fun today.
Araja: You can rest in my house, if you'd like. Vanarana will guard your dreams.
Traveler: I'll take the offer. I'm feeling rather tired.
Traveler: Well, since Paimon's exhausted...
Traveler: I'll accept it.
Arama: #Thank you, Nara {NICKNAME}, for accepting our flowers! That gives us greater joy than soaking in the sun, drinking sweet water, and dreaming nice things.
Traveler: No way!
Traveler: We met an odd Aranara once...
Paimon: Yes. It said that Bija is yielded from the extraction of memories and dreams.
Traveler: Araja, what do you mean you "can't leave"...?
Traveler: I totally didn't forget that, ahaha...
Paimon: #Paimon blames it on Festival Utsava feast that {NICKNAME} made. It was so delicious that Paimon got distracted.
