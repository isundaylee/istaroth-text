Diona: Hey Dad, want to play a game of Genius Invokation?
Diona: But before we play, I got one thing to say to you! If you're already tipsy from drinking today, then the game will be over in three rounds.
Draff: In three rounds? Sounds like you're underestimating your dear father.
Draff: I'm pretty sure I could drag the game out to at least five rounds.
Diona: Hmph! And you'd still lose! You think that's something to be proud of?
Diona: Last time we played, you mistook the Hydro Elemental Dice you rolled for Cryo! Ugh, so annoying!
Draff: Haha, you know I have a problem with my eyesight...
Diona: No, you have a problem with drinking! Don't try to cover it up!
Draff: Alright, alright, I know, drinking is bad. I won't drink today, not even a single drop. There, happy?
Diona: I guess so.
Draff: Now, if I DO win, what's the prize?
Diona: What? You're trying to get me to mix you a drink? Don't you even think about it!
Draff: What if I win in under five rounds?
Diona: In your dreams, I won't lose! Let's start!

Beidou: So, you leave for a few days and come back with some serious TCG skills. Care to explain?
Kaedehara Kazuha: I was fortunate enough to have played a match with a skilled opponent.
Beidou: Oh? And who might that be? Wait, let me try to guess...
Beidou: Ningguang doesn't have the time for this sort of thing... Hmm, Xiangling and Xinyan aren't usually practicing either...
Beidou: If Yaoyao were free, she'd be running down to the ship to say hi to everyone, so that rules her out.
Beidou: #Hah, could it be Traveler? Did he happen to be in Liyue Harbor?
Kaedehara Kazuha: #Sorry Captain, you still haven't guessed it. But I did happen to see Traveler, and even forged a new friendship over cards...
Beidou: Oh, made a new friend, huh? Then I won't be able to guess it.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, I met Hu Tao, director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Have you heard of her?
Beidou: Yeah, I've heard of her before. Isn't she the one that won the King of Invokations Grand Prix in Liyue?
Kaedehara Kazuha: That's right. She said that she's been an admirer of yours for a long time, and hopes to make your acquaintance one day.
Beidou: Alright! There isn't a better opportunity!
Beidou: We'll invite her aboard to play a few matches, and I'll get a taste of playing against a champion.
Beidou: Oh, speaking of which, perhaps I should go find her personally at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. You know, to show some sincerity.

Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hmm? Oh, did you make the trip all the way back here just to see me?
Traveler: About the thieves...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ah, so that's what you uncovered in the end. Hmm, I'm not quite sure how I feel about that.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: But thank you for letting me know.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hearing how things ended almost feels like reading the end of a light novel. Now we can all rest at ease.
Traveler: About the tournament...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: "Winning or losing isn't what's most important. It's about playing with elegance." That's how I've always looked at it, anyway.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: After seeing you all cheering for me though, I suppose I really tried to bring my best to the game.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hehe... Now that I think about it, it was great that I was able to speak with you before the competition.
Traveler: Energy +5?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ah! No, please don't ever mention that to anyone!
Traveler: I'll be on my way, then.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Since you came all the way to Watatsumi Island, you might as well rest for a moment before you return.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I hope this view will stay in your heart forever.

Tighnari: #Traveler, what a coincidence! Cyno already told me everything that happened.
Traveler: About Cyno's unfunny jokes...
Tighnari: I'll stop you right there! Cyno has already told me countless jokes with that smug look on his face. I don't want to hear any more.
Tighnari: That's all I have to say on that topic.
Traveler: About Genius Invokation TCG...
Tighnari: Things have been quiet in the Avidya Forest lately, so I've been playing with Collei every now and then.
Tighnari: Collei never ceases to amaze me. She even managed to place well in that tournament.
Tighnari: Even though I was able to make it out of the qualifiers, luck wasn't on my side and I faced Cyno only a few matches in.
Tighnari: That guy shows no mercy when it comes to Genius Invokation. He even let out a loud yell when he played the winning card... It really hurt my ears.
Tighnari: It's been a while since I've seen him get so stirred up like that.
Traveler: I'll be on my way, then.
Tighnari: No need to be so polite. You should visit again when you have the time.

Tournament Notice: Timmie is breezing right through the tournament as if he has the blessing of the Anemo Archon! And now he's one of the favorites to win Mondstadt's regional final!
Tournament Notice (Message): Little Timmie really is something else. You all should've seen him play against that golden-haired lass, the way he won...
Tournament Notice (Anonymous Reply): How absurd! Did you not see the plume glowing with holy light on that young boy's back?
Tournament Notice (Anonymous Reply): Its scorching light must have shackled and blinded the Prinzessin's Auge der Verurteilung and twisted the scales of fate!
Tournament Notice (Anonymous Reply): I shall bring my faithful retainers from the Immernachtreich, and vengeance shall be mine!
Tournament Notice (Scribbled-Over, Almost Illegible Message): ██y, don't ██ too late. If you see this ██, don't ██ to come back ██ for ██.

Tournament Notice: Be sure to visit the food stalls next to the tournament grounds, with a variety of snacks sure to please the palate! The Limited Edition Minty Qingxin Cakes are selling out quick!
Tournament Notice (Message): Do these Minty Qingxin Cakes live up to the hype? I keep coming back but I've never managed to get my hands on one...
Tournament Notice (Reply): New to the tournament venue, huh? Word is that the snack is a favorite among the adepti, so it sold out on the first day.
Tournament Notice (Reply): It does taste refreshing, but it's also just a little bit bitter.
Tournament Notice (Reply): It's so bitter.
Tournament Notice (Reply): It's so bitter my tongue shriveled.
Tournament Notice (Reply): It tastes good.
Tournament Notice (Reply): Ugh, now I'm curious! When's this snack gonna be back on sale? Come on, you're missing out on so much business!
Tournament Notice (Reply): Speaking of the adepti... Do they also play Genius Invokation TCG?
Tournament Notice (Reply): Everyone likes to have fun, right?

Tournament Notice: In Inazuma's regional final, Guuji Yae Miko of the Grand Narukami Shrine will be facing off against Sangonomiya Kokomi, Divine Priestess of the Sangonomiya Shrine!

Tournament Notice (Message): I'll always support Yae Miko-sama!
Tournament Notice (Reply): She doesn't have a chance. I'm confident Madam Sangonomiya Kokomi will be the one that emerges victorious.
Tournament Notice (Reply): In your dreams! Why don't you put your money where your mouth is and bet on it?
Tournament Notice (Reply): Bring it on! Loser pays for dinner!
Tournament Notice (The Tenryou Commission's Reply): Please abide by the tournament venue's rules and enjoy the tournament in a respectful manner.

Tournament Notice: The exciting King of Invokations Grand Prix is in full swing! Many outstanding players have emerged from the competiton. Come participate in the duels today!
Tournament Notice (Message): Huh, I didn't think you building designers could play cards so well. Quite a few players from Kshahrewar made it to the quarterfinals.
Tournament Notice (Reply): What do you mean, "building designers"? We study structural geometry and mechanism theory, and it's MUCH more complex than staring at words all day in Haravatat.
Tournament Notice (Reply): "Staring at words all day"? You should try "staring at words" a bit, maybe then you'd learn to write! Linguistics and Rune Studies are both extremely profound fields of knowledge.
Tournament Notice (Reply): Everyone has their specialties. But since nobody is willing to yield, why don't we organize an Interdarshan Invokation Championship?
Tournament Notice (Reply): Good idea!
Tournament Notice (Reply): Great idea!
Tournament Notice (Reply): I'll see you at the tournament!
