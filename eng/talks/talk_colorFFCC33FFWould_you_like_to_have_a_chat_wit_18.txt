Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Would you like to have a chat with me?</color>
Qiqi: Chat... chat...
Qiqi: That would be nice. Chatting with you would be great.
Qiqi: ...But...
Traveler: But what?
Qiqi: ...I'll forget.
Qiqi: I'll forget everything we said...
Qiqi: ...I'll forget what your voice sounded like...
Qiqi: ...And... the happy feeling... I'll forget that too...
Traveler: But you will be happy in the moment, right? That's what's important.
Qiqi: Oh... really?
Qiqi: I suppose that... if I was sad now... you would be sad, too.
Qiqi: Okay. Qiqi wants to smile.
Traveler: Aww, what a cute smile.
Qiqi: Oh...
Qiqi: ...It's because you're here.
Traveler: I'll come and chat with you every day.
Qiqi: Every day...?
Qiqi: So, every day will be... happy?
