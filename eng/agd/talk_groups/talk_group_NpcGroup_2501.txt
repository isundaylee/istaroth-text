Traveler: Who is Bluey...?
Little Mao: Bluey is my friend! She's from the mountains. She plays with me and takes me to many fun places in the mountains. We eat lots of delicious fruits too, and she lets me touch little rabbits and little cats.
Little Mao: She's really nice and really cool! When she came out of the forest, the branches and vines clattered as they retreated automatically. When she took me to cross the river, the moss on the stones also crept away, returning only after the two of us had crossed the river.
Little Mao: But that's not all! Hmm... the birds and snakes also follow her instructions. I accidentally lost my things several times, and Bluey asked the birds to find them in the forest for me.

Traveler: Seeya.
Little Mao: Bye. Um, don't go into the mountains whenever you like, or you'll make Bluey unhappy.

Traveler: I'd love to meet Bluey.
Little Mao: No way! She's scared of strangers and doesn't usually wanna meet other people.
Little Mao: Hmm. Actually, why did she meet with me then? I'm not sure... It's just... When I was playing in the mountains one time, I saw a rabbit that couldn't move because of a rock that was on top of it. I removed that rock and gave it a fruit.
Little Mao: Although it didn't eat the fruit... it nodded at me before hopping into the forest.
Little Mao: It rained heavily after that on that day, and I couldn't find my way home, so I hid under a big rock.
Little Mao: Hehe... that's when Bluey came to me with lots of fruits. She told me to eat my fill and then guided me out of the mountains.
Little Mao: But my parents didn't believe what I told them after I got home. They just told me to never enter the mountains by myself again.

Traveler: Don't sneak into the mountains by yourself. It's dangerous.
Little Mao: I know. Uncle Luo and Grandpa Lu always say that too, but... Hehe, they can't keep an eye on me all the time, can they?
Little Mao: The mountains really aren't that dangerous. Bluey and Big Sis Fujin are there too. It's been a while since I've played with Bluey, too.
Little Mao: I wanted to introduce Grandpa Lu to Bluey earlier, but she said that wasn't a good idea, so I dropped the idea.

Traveler: They're both adepti, so I'm sure everything will be fine.
Little Mao: Really? But... if they're fine, why couldn't I find Bluey anywhere when I went to play in the mountains after that, then?
Little Mao: I walked along the river for ages, eating several large fruits and getting hungry two or three times along the way, but I couldn't find her anywhere. In the end, I lay down next to a giant tree and fell asleep. It was in my dream that I saw her.
Little Mao: She told me to eat until I was full after waking up and then go home first because she was busy with something.
Little Mao: After I woke up, I ate the fruits Bluey left next to me and then went home like she told me to...
Little Mao: Bluey didn't tell me what she was busy with... but maybe I can help her!

Traveler: Wait, Bluey gave you fruits?
Little Mao: Yes. There was a big pile of fruits next to me when I woke up. Some were sweet, and some were sour, and some were really difficult to bite into. Oh, some of them spurted juice all over my clothes when I bit them. Fortunately, I was next to a river, so I could wash my clothes there.
Little Mao: *sigh* I wonder when Bluey will finish with whatever she's doing. I miss her and Big Sis Fujin...
