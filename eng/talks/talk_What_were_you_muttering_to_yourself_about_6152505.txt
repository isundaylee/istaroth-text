# Talk Dialog

Traveler: What were you muttering to yourself about?
Vile: Sara decided she wanted to import Liyue chili peppers recently. Allegedly, they're hot enough to reduce even Mondstadt's die-hard spice lover Barbara to tears.
Vile: My view is they'd be nigh on impossible to sell, seeing as eighty-six percent of Mondstadters won't touch them.
Traveler: ...Barbara is a die-hard spice lover?
Vile: Oh, you hadn't heard? It was my understanding that everyone in Mondstadt knew.
Traveler: Tell me some more things that everyone in Mondstadt knows.
Vile: Certainly, I'm sure everyone knows about Librarian Lisa's habit of drinking afternoon tea.
Vile: Well, one day, a traveling merchant from Liyue saw Lisa using some special web-shaped things to filter her tea.
Vile: Although the merchant never saw exactly what it was that Lisa was using, nevertheless a new drink known as Earl Stocking Tea was later released imitating Lisa's own technique.
Vile: Shortly after the matter, some people claimed that what Lisa was using for her tea was just an ordinary filtration material, used all the time in alchemy. But even I'm not entirely sure what the truth of the matter is...
Vile: Over time, that ambiguously named tea drink started to gain popularity, even in Mondstadt, a city that's known for its wine culture more than anything else.
Vile: I can't help but admire the entrepreneurial minds of the people of Liyue. They're always coming up with something bound to catch on with people... Hmm...
Traveler: You should tell her about your concerns.
Vile: Oh believe me, I've tried.
Vile: If I can't think of anything better, I may have to send in Prince Charming...
Vile: Kaeya's got a certain way with words. He would only need to drop a few subtle hints and the whole thing would be sorted.
Vile: Ahem. Anyway. Thanks for the chat.
