# Potions Most Potent


## Talk 1

Paimon: It's been a while since we last visited the Knights of Favonius! Paimon wonders what Jean and Lisa have been up to recently. Let's go pay them a visit!

## Talk 2

Lisa: Ooh, looks like you finished your potion! Now, all we need to do is put it on display for sale.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Looks like we're done with all the prep work! Why don't we take a short break over there while we wait for customers to arrive?

## Talk 4

Lisa: Ooh, seems like everything is going well. You've already sold your first batch of potions. Not a bad start at all.
Lisa: As for what potions you should brew next, we'll need to consult the news from the market.
Lisa: That means staying up to date on the latest news and trends to try and anticipate people's needs. It's an essential skill when it comes to business.
Paimon: Uh, that sounds kinda hard...
Lisa: Hehe... Don't worry. I already took it upon myself to compile all the latest news on the market for you.
Lisa: What do you think? Have any ideas on the kinds of potions you should sell next?
Lisa: Go ahead and try to cultivate some herbs then. Bio-alchemical processing can infuse herbs with different effects and properties.
Lisa: Using different herbs in the brewing process will, in turn, alter the effects of the potion. There's a whole bunch of combinations to try.
Lisa: Alright cutie, why don't you get started?

## Talk 5

Lisa: Go ahead and try to cultivate some herbs.

## Talk 6

Lisa: Seems like you've gotten the hang of the cultivation side of things.
Lisa: Ah, I should probably mention, a knight from the Logistics Company has arrived. She'll be the one handling the provision of all future supplies. You should go have a chat with her in a little bit.
Lisa: And after that, it'll be your time to shine!
Traveler: Wait, what about you?
Paimon: Yeah! Shouldn't it be our time to shine? Y'know, the three of us? What about your role in all this?
Lisa: My role? Naturally, it was to ensure my cuties had all the business and alchemy knowledge they needed to succeed!
Lisa: Okay, I'll be rooting for you! Good luck!
Paimon: Paimon knew this would happen...

## Talk 7

Freda: #Greetings, Honorary Knight! Greetings, Paimon! My name is Freda. I'm a knight from the Logistics Company. It's such an honor to meet the famous {NICKNAME} and {M#his}{F#her} loyal attendant!
Paimon: #Wow, Paimon's fame is really spreading across the land, hehe! One small correction though. Paimon's {M#his}{F#her} companion, not {M#his}{F#her} attendant!
Freda: Ah, my apologies. I guess I got a bit carried away after hearing all about your exploits. It's just like something out of a novel!
Freda: You're practically legends at this point. I'm a bit jealous, actually...
Freda: I'd love to wander the land in search of adventure like one of those knights you read about in stories! Seems like a really fun life.
Traveler: Maybe you'll get the chance one day!
Freda: Yeah! That's what I'm hoping, at least!
Freda: Anyway, we've got some prep work to wrap up, right?
Freda: My orders from the Acting Grand Master are to support your business in any way I can.
Freda: If there's anything you need, just let me know!
Traveler: Purchase supplies...
Freda: You're in luck! I just got a new batch of provisions! Please take a look and see if anything catches your eye!
Traveler: Goodbye.
Freda: Best of luck with your business!
Traveler: It's not actually all fun and games.
Freda: I bet. The knights in the stories are always running into all sorts of danger...

## Talk 8

Lisa: Have a question for me, cutie?
Traveler: About brewing potions...
Lisa: All you need to do is add the ingredients into the cauldron, follow the steps provided, and you're good to go.
Lisa: Using different herbs in the brewing process will, in turn, alter the effects of the potion. There's a whole bunch of combinations to try.
Traveler: About cultivating herbs...
Lisa: Bio-alchemical processing can infuse herbs with different effects and properties. The type of potion you want to brew will determine what kinds of herbs you need to cultivate.
Traveler: About the market...
Lisa: You'll need to consult the news of the market to determine what kinds of potions to brew.
Lisa: I already took the liberty of compiling the latest details on the market for you. You can find the information I collected right by those shelves over there.
Traveler: I have no more questions.
Lisa: Well, if there's anything else you want to ask, don't hesitate to come and find me.

## Talk 9

Freda: Hello there! As always, I, Freda, will do my best to assist you today.
Traveler: Purchase supplies...
Traveler: Goodbye.
Freda: Best of luck with your business!
