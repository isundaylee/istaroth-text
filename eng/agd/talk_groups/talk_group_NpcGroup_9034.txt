Traveler: How do you like it here?
Noelle: I love the atmosphere here, as I'm sure you'd expect.
Noelle: The exterior is spacious and very pleasant, and the interior is exquisitely decorated.
Noelle: I do believe it's the finest estate I've ever seen!
Noelle: The only problem is...
Traveler: Problem? What is it?
Noelle: Compared to Mondstadt, there is far too little here for a maid to do.
Noelle: It feels a little too relaxing...

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Noelle: It would be my pleasure!
Noelle: Do you know something? Ever since I came here, I don't believe I've picked up a single item of lost property.
Noelle: I'm still not used to it...
Traveler: ...Huh?
Noelle: What I mean is, I often used to find odds and ends while performing my cleaning duties.
Noelle: For example... A faded headband under a cabinet.
Noelle: Or a ball hidden in a bush by a kitten.
Noelle: Or a bookmark in a corner of the library, keys dropped at the side of the road, an unsigned letter of confession stuck in the door of the church...
Traveler: Sounds like cleaning is quite exhausting...
Noelle: No, no, not at all! It is a great honor to perform my duties.
Noelle: Speaking of cleaning...
Noelle: This place always seems so clean and tidy.
Traveler: In no small part due to your efforts.
Noelle: Thank you...!
Noelle: It's always very fulfilling to work here! More so than when I'm cleaning for the Knights or anywhere else.
Noelle: Because... this is your home.
Traveler: Where do all these things end up?
Noelle: I always do my utmost to reunite each item with its owner! But the ones that go unclaimed remain at the Knights of Favonius headquarters.
Traveler: Wait, so you go around collecting random lost items?
Noelle: N—No, they're just items I find while cleaning...

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Noelle: Huh? You're asking me...?
Noelle: I... I want to take your measurements and make an outfit for you.
Traveler: Where has that idea come from?
Noelle: If you wore clothes that I made for you...
Noelle: It'd most certainly be a wonderfully momentous occasion...
Traveler: Well, if you insist... Much obliged!
Noelle: Okay... Alright then...
Noelle: Excellent! Time to get busy-busy again!
Noelle: Only, this must be the happiest kind of busy in all of Teyvat.
Traveler: I'll be sure to get you something in return.
Traveler: So you even know how to sew, too?
Noelle: Oh, of course... They... don't call me the, uh, "Wondermaid" for nothing...

Noelle: These facilities will make it much easier to maintain our weapons.
Noelle: After all, I must be ready for battle at any moment if I am to protect everyone.

## Talk 10

Noelle: Did you arrange all of this yourself?
Noelle: To have you do such strenuous work yourself... I should have come to your aid earlier. I have neglected my duty as a maid.
Noelle: You must be tired after a hard day's work. I'll brew you some tea and prepare your favorite snacks. Please rest well.
