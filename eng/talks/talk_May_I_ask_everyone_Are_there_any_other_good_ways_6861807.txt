Message: "May I ask everyone: Are there any other good ways to relieve stress besides meditation? My mental load has been heavy recently, so I hope you can be generous with your advice. Many thanks."
Another Person's Message: "I've never seen a case like yours before. How about this: You go find Master Matla, who is a well-trained witch doctor. Tell him your symptoms, and he should be able to treat you."
Message: "Thanks for the suggestion, but I don't think that's going to work. You see, I *am* Master Matla."
