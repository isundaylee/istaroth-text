Traveler: About the "Phantom Blubberbeast"...
Lepine-Pauline: Huh? Are you also curious about the details of their crimes?
Lepine-Pauline: In order to get the first samples for my "Graph Adversarial Technology," I interviewed numerous shops, and none of their owners have even heard of such a thing.
Lepine-Pauline: Even the author of the report hadn't the foggiest notion, it was as though they had completely absconded from Fontaine...
Lepine-Pauline: I think either that the "Phantom Blubberbeast" criminal base is extremely well hidden and kept very secret...
Lepine-Pauline: Or the Maison Gardiennage has ordered the shopowners to keep their mouths shut, and none of them are willing to reveal anything to outsiders.
Lepine-Pauline: Either way, this proves that the danger posed by the "Phantom Blubberbeast" is quite grave, and thus proves there is a huge market for my "Graph Adversarial Technology"! This is an incredible business opportunity!
