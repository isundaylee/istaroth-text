# Sailor's Treasure


## Talk 1

Zhang Shun: Hmm, what to do, what to do...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Zhang Shun: I used to be a sailor with The Crux, until I suffered an unlucky injury...
Zhang Shun: After I left the fleet I needed money, so I pawned a few Treasure Maps. I gave them to local businessman Bolai.
Zhang Shun: The agreement was that I would get a share of any treasure found. But I haven't heard a word from him since, and I suspect he hasn't even tried to look for the treasure.
Zhang Shun: I can't keep waiting around like this. Would you be willing to search for the treasure for me?
Traveler: Okay.
Zhang Shun: Thank you.
Zhang Shun: Start by paying a visit to *Bolai* to fetch the *Treasure Maps*. Then, find the *treasure* and *take it to him*.
Zhang Shun: I spoke to him about it already. He will hold onto my share for me.
Traveler: What made you leave the fleet?
Zhang Shun: I realized that my past injury could flare up at any point and start causing real trouble. I couldn't let something like that put the rest of the crew at risk, so I chose to leave.
Zhang Shun: I started selling a few odds and ends that I'd picked up over the years to earn a living. But business wasn't great and I soon ran out of things to sell anyway.
Zhang Shun: I used to own a few Treasure Maps. They were loot I picked up back in the day with the crew.
Zhang Shun: In my condition though, it's enough of a struggle just to walk down the street... I can't exactly go shooting off around the world on a treasure hunt, can I?
Zhang Shun: So I pawned them, gave them to Bolai for a bit of cash.
Zhang Shun: But it seems like he can't go and look for the treasure in person either. He is just a businessman, after all... So that's why I need your help.
Traveler: How much treasure are we talking?
Zhang Shun: Oh, there won't be a huge amount. These were just low-profile treasure maps split among the crew members along with the rest of the loot.
Zhang Shun: The experienced crew of the fleet can always tell when there's a serious amount of treasure involved, and they'll track it down and bring it back to the ship.
Zhang Shun: Any treasure we find will be on the smaller scale, but it will still be worth something. Certainly enough to split three ways... So good luck out there!

## Talk 2

Bolai: Hello there, my friend! What can I get you?
Traveler: Treasure Maps.
Bolai: Treasure Maps? Oh, you must mean Zhang Shun's maps.
Bolai: So, you're really going to look for this treasure, eh? I must say, I only ever saw them as a bit of fun.
Bolai: You, though, I can tell with one look that you're the real adventurer type. The sort whose eyes light up as soon as someone mentions the word "treasure."
Bolai: I don't have much use for these Treasure Maps at the end of the day, so you might as well have them.
Bolai: That said, if you do find any treasure, let's split it evenly.
Bolai: After all, I have been looking after these maps for a while. It's only fair to contribute something in the way of storage fees...

## Talk 3

Traveler: Yes please.
Bolai: Alright... There you go.
Bolai: Have a good one. And don't forget to bring the treasure back here when you find it — we split it three ways, as agreed.

## Talk 4

Traveler: No need.
Bolai: Alright then, it's your funeral...
Bolai: Have a good one. And don't forget to bring the treasure back here when you find it — we split it three ways, as agreed.

## Talk 5

Zhang Shun: If it wasn't for my injury... I could be out there chasing down even bigger treasure hoards with the captain and my old crew mates...
Zhang Shun: *sigh* What I would give to be back on board that ship just one more time...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Bolai: You're back! Found the treasure?
Traveler: Yes.
Bolai: Nice one! I said you looked like a real adventurer, didn't I? Well, now you've proven it.
Bolai: Right, let's see what we have in this box... Hmph. What a pile of junk...
Bolai: Well, can't blame you for trying! Here's your share, I'll hold on to Zhang Shun's share until he comes to collect it.
Bolai: *sigh* Still didn't find it... That guy is taking me for a ride, I swear...

### Additional Talk 2

Bolai: Are you sure? I would have thought it'd be a useful nugget of information...

### Additional Talk 3

Bolai: I almost forgot, do you know how to read these Treasure Maps?
Bolai: Frankly, I couldn't make head or tail of them when I first got them, so I had several people take a look.
Bolai: They figured out more or less where the treasure is. But they said if I went to look for the treasure, I should pay them an extra fee... That's why I never bothered to go.
Bolai: If it saves you the bother, I can mark the location for you, no problem. Just say the word.
Bolai: But, y'know, I'd have to make you pay a contribution... Let's call it *100 Mora*?
Bolai: What do you say? Shall I *mark the location* on the Treasure Maps for you?

### Additional Talk 4

Bolai: You're back! Found the treasure?
Traveler: Yes.
Bolai: Nice one! I said you looked like a real adventurer, didn't I? Well, now you've proven it.
Bolai: Right, let's see what we have in this box... What's this? Map fragments?
Bolai: Huh, so he was right. Those batty old Treasure Maps really do have clues to where the treasure lies...
Bolai: Oh? You're still here? Here, take your share... and hurry along now, you must have other things to do. I'll hold Zhang Shun's share till he comes to collect it.
