Traveler: Never heard of him...
Homayun: Well, he's been absorbed in research and barely shows up around here. That Vikram always steals the limelight.
Homayun: If it weren't for the fact that he's a candidate for the next Grand Conservator, not many would have heard his name.
Homayun: I prefer him though, compared to that Vikram fellow. Rifaet is more like a researcher in my opinion.
Homayun: But I don't know what those sages think. After all, they're the ones who have the final say.
