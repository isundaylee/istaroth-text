# The Exile: Sprouting


## Talk 1

Sabbah: If it weren't for you, I don't think I'd have ever seen these roses sprout.
Sabbah: If only I knew this would happen... instead of seeds, I should have brought a few more books.
Traveler: You're not from here?
Sabbah: Are you surprised? Well, I guess that means that I've adapted pretty well.
Sabbah: When I first got here, I was unable to get used to anything, whether it be the food, the housing, or anything else.
Sabbah: But I got used to everything over time.
Sabbah: That doesn't mean that I've fully accepted my predicament, though.
Sabbah: I suppose it is impossible to make roses from Sumeru City bloom here after all.
Traveler: Are you a researcher?
Sabbah: I could have been called that once, but not anymore.
Sabbah: I said something beyond my station, and learned something I shouldn't have.
Sabbah: I broke the Akademiya's taboos, so I was removed from amongst their ranks.
Traveler: What did you say?
Sabbah: Curiosity is the impetus for seeking wisdom, but it's also the cause of sin.
Sabbah: I only understood that after I was exiled to this place.
Sabbah: For safety reasons, I don't think I should go into details.
Traveler: All right then.
Sabbah: Ahem, but...
Sabbah: I thought adventurers would just come and go, never coming back to chit-chat after finishing their jobs.
Sabbah: I didn't expect to have another long conversation with you.
Sabbah: To be honest, I don't have a lot of friends to talk to here.
Sabbah: Do you think... at some point... you would be able to come by and fertilize my plants again?
Traveler: Sure.
Sabbah: ...Okay then, I'll wait for you.
Traveler: Why grow Sumeru Roses?
Sabbah: You probably don't know much about them... but they are very versatile, and have many uses.
Sabbah: They can be eaten, turned into medicine, given as gifts, or fetch a good price on the market.
Sabbah: And that's just some of the more common applications.
Sabbah: The flower, leaves, and stalk of a Sumeru Rose also did not always look like this. They all had different appearances once upon a time.
Sabbah: I believe geographical changes led to changes in the roses' traits.
Sabbah: A study of its traits could help us derive past geographical and historical information.
Sabbah: I won't be able to explain the mechanism over just a casual conversation, and sharing such information with adventurers is probably against the rules as well.
Sabbah: If you're interested in botanical evolution, you should visit the Akademiya. They'll have more on the subject.
Traveler: So, you're doing this for your research?
Sabbah: I'm not a researcher anymore. I no longer have the right or means to pursue any research.
Sabbah: If you must know why... *sigh*, you are a very curious soul, you know that?
Sabbah: I grew a lot of Sumeru Roses back in my former residence. The flowers were spectacular, and I got to see them every day.
Sabbah: If it was possible, I wish I could see them again, just like before.
Sabbah: ...That's all there is to it.
Traveler: I can understand that.

## Talk 2

Sabbah: Can you wield Dendro? Are you someone with a Vision?
Sabbah: I haven't met anyone like that in a long time. What a nostalgic feeling...
Paimon: It should be fine now, right, Miss Sabbah?
Sabbah: That's right, they should sprout soon if powered by Dendro. Let's just wait for a while...
Black Screen Text: Gradually, sprouts begin peeking out of the soil.
Black Screen Text: They stop growing after sprouting a few leaves.
Paimon: #They're sprouting! Paimon knew you could do just about anything, {NICKNAME}!
Sabbah: The results were immediate, as I thought... Thank you.
Traveler: Too bad there are no flowers yet.
Sabbah: Oh, that's normal. You can't rush such things.
Sabbah: Plants have to go through stages of growth. That you were able to make them sprout is already quite amazing.
Sabbah: Give the roses some more time to take in the nourishment. It will be better for them as well.
Sabbah: I'm very grateful to you as it is. I wouldn't wish to bother you further.
Sabbah: Just drop by and see them in your spare time. That would be enough.

Sabbah: Do you really have a way to grow roses through the power of <color=#00E1FFFF>Dendro</color>?
