Traveler: Adventure Challenge

## Talk

Traveler: Duel

## Talk

Jifang: How could this be...

## Talk

Jifang: Hmph, that's what I think about when nobody's buying books. I won't let you win that easily.

## Talk

Jifang: So... are you gonna buy a book or not?

## Talk

Jifang: At your skill level, you should play more!

## Talk

Jifang: Guess everyone's interested in history now, eh...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Jifang: A lot of people have become interested in Liyue's history recently, and many of them have been coming to my store to buy books...
Jifang: In the past, it would take half a year to sell the few copies of "Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti" that we had, so I stopped importing such obscure history books...
Jifang: But after the recent events that happened here, people from all over the city would come here to purchase history texts...
Jifang: These past few days have been full of customers who specifically wanted books containing Rex Lapis' stories.
Jifang: *sigh* Who knows if they really love reading, or if they're just looking to inject a bit of spice into their daily chatter...
Jifang: Due to the surge in demand, I've almost had no time to attend to some special orders that we've gotten from old customers.
Jifang: I finally found the time to put together the books that two such customers wanted, but I'm too busy to leave the store at the moment.
Jifang: Could you help me send this copy of "Verses of Equilibrium" to Uncle Tian, and this copy of "Rex Incognito (IV)" to Gentry De'an?

## Talk

Traveler: I'll do it.
Jifang: Thank you very much. They must surely be growing impatient by now. After all, they placed their orders a long time ago, but I've only just gotten around to putting those orders together...
Jifang: *sigh* With so many customers all of a sudden, I barely know how to keep up...

## Talk

Traveler: I'd love to, but I have to get going.
Jifang: No problem. I'll look for someone else to help me out.

## Talk

Traveler: "Records of Jueyun"?
Jifang: You seem like you could handle it. See what you think of this one: Records of Jueyun - Stone Beasts.
Jifang: Take it with you if you want. Just bring it back when you get sick of it.
Jifang: ...I won't hold my breath, though, I've had plenty of customers who borrow books and don't return them.

## Talk

Jifang: Found one you like? Please pay over here.

## Talk

Traveler: I want to know about the Wanwen Bookhouse.
Jifang: Strange, most people who come here are looking for books, not the bookhouse itself...
Jifang: Anyway, my husband is the one with a bit of a thing for collecting old books. But he doesn't earn any money...
Jifang: That's why I opened this place. Got to make a living somehow.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Jifang: Typical. You sit there reading the book in-store, then as soon as I ask if you want to buy it you're all, "Oh, I'm just browsing" and "Oh, I might come back tomorrow..."

## Talk

Traveler: I'm looking to buy some books.
Jifang: Pick them out yourself. When you find one you like, pay here.

## Talk

Traveler: Any recommended reads?
Jifang: Let's see... If you like poetry, Humor From Tianheng is selling well at the moment. Seems to have a mass appeal.
Jifang: If you're a visitor in town, you might enjoy Records of Jueyun. It's not for the faint-hearted, though.

## Talk

Jifang: I'm just taking a look around the market. Don't forget to stop by the Wanwen Bookhouse if you have time.
Jifang: Although, the store is full of old books that won't sell... I'm half inclined to turn them into scrap paper and donate them as Mingxiao Lantern supplies.
