This place is gonna collapse!
It's been a while since we flew like this together
Huh, Dvalin?
Just now... Why...
Why did you not ask me to protect you like the last time?
Me not wanting you to listen to the Abyss Order
Doesn't mean that you have to listen to me
Freedom, if demanded of you by an archon
Is really no freedom at all
Is this... the power of the Anemo Archon?
But I am no longer part of the Four Winds
Even if that's so
You still protected us regardless
Now, spread your wings of freedom
And go with my blessing
And so, the Stormterror threat was quelled
I clarified the misunderstanding to the citizens of Mondstadt
And let them know that they are safe
To them it seems
Stormterror attacked Mondstadt out of nowhere
And then vanished just as quickly
They must be finding the whole ordeal very confusing
However, winds change their course
Someday
They will blow towards a brighter future
