# Back to Normal: The Story Hidden in the Bottle


## Talk 1

Idyia: The hub consists of these components. All you need to do is place them onto the foundation in the right shape...
Paimon: The right shape? But we've never seen what it looks like...
Idyia: Ah, don't worry about it... Close enough will do. As long as it can spin, it'll be fine! Should be fine... I think...
Paimon: Ugh... Sometimes, you have no standards whatsoever...

## Talk 2

Collei: Something that spins... Would a water wheel count?

## Talk 3

Paimon: We did it!
Collei: But why isn't it turning...?
Idyia: The components are back in the core, and the hub is restored to its proper shape again.
Idyia: Hehe, that's all we needed to do. Like any wound, it just needs time to heal. It'll probably just start turning again one day in the middle of the night, when no one's looking...
Kaeya: Really? I thought that with your special abilities, you could get it turning again right away.
Idyia: What...
Paimon: Huh?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: All of us are dying to see it. Not just how the domain looks when it's fixed, but also Idyia... in her element.
Klee: I wanna see Idyia using her magic powers, too! I bet they're super awesome!
Paimon: Uhh... What are you guys talking about? And how is Klee in on this but Paimon isn't?
Traveler: Haven't you noticed, Paimon?
Eula: They're referring to... our mascot's true form.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: As I've said all along, there's much more to Idyia than she gives herself credit for. She has a very special power... Though I think some of us have sensed that already.
Collei: Did you notice right away, General? I only found out when I was chatting with Eula.
Kaeya: So our General was the first to notice? It seems like she's more perceptive than she lets on...
Eula: I'd say the same about you, Kaeya.
Idyia: What the... All of you know? ...I mean, I wasn't trying to hide anything from you, I promise!
Idyia: It's just... For people who stumble upon this place by accident, I think my current form is more approachable than my true one... I—I don't want people to get scared when they see me...
Traveler: Ah, I wondered!
Paimon: What? What is it? And whatever it is, how the heck does everyone know about it?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Um... Well for one thing, I sensed elemental energy in the residents here, but none of them have Visions.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Then my mind started to wander as I was reading a story book, and suddenly I had a thought. Since Hydro Eidolons can change into any form... why not human form?
Idyia: You hit the nail on the head...
Idyia: Alright. In that case, please allow me to introduce myself once more:
Idyia: I am an Oceanid who was exiled here when the former Hydro Archon passed away. My name is Idyia.
Traveler: An Oceanid...
Klee: Wow, Idyia, you're so pretty!
Idyia: Heh... Now that I'm in my true form, I suddenly feel a little embarrassed talking to you all...
Eula: You look stunning. You should be flaunting this look at every opportunity.
Idyia: Come on, I'm too shy!
Paimon: Wait... So does this mean that all the people we met in here are actually...
Kaeya: I'm guessing that the human counterparts to these Hydro alter egos are long gone.
Idyia: That's right. When they wanted to leave, I took them to the edge of the desert...
Idyia: The "components" are, in fact, gifts that they gave to me before they left.
Idyia: But I'm always curious about what brings people here... So I used the Streaming Projector to bring their wishes to life.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The power to grant wishes... but only within the confines of the bottle.
Idyia: Exactly.
Kaeya: It's a truly extraordinary light.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I've just realized something... When the components fell from the core, it appeared as if they had returned to their respective owners. But actually...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It was after the components landed where they did that their owners and the things associated with them arose around them to form the different zones.
Collei: So now that the components have been retrieved, does that mean that all those things are gone...?
Idyia: Don't worry, they'll be quite safe. As long as I remember them... they'll never disappear.
Idyia: However much we might criticize each other, or get into scuffles... In this mirage, they will always be my friends.
Klee: I had so much fun in the Choo-Choo Cart and hanging out with Mr. Director! I'll never forget them either!
Collei: Me neither. I'll always remember my adventures in this fantasy land.
Idyia: Haha, very good. But it's probably time I set this wheel in motion.
Collei: This one's all yours, Idyia! Our magical mascot.
Paimon: Aaah... please work...
Idyia: ...
Idyia: ...
Traveler: ...
Idyia: Huh? That's strange, nothing happened... Has it lost some power because of the incident?
Idyia: Oh, crumbs... Not now, not right off the back of everyone putting me on a pedestal... And me acting like this was going to be my big moment...
Idyia: *sob* Someone get me a bottle, I'm hiding myself away! See you in a hundred years!
Paimon: Uhh... You're already in a bottle...
Idyia: What now? This was the only way... Now I'll never be able to show you how the Veluriyam Mirage is supposed to look...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hold on... I have an idea.
Idyia: Yes, General Sangonomiya? I'm all ears!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: If it's okay with you, would you let me borrow the Shinrou Casket from the domain's core?
Idyia: Ah, the Shinrou Casket... That sounds familiar. One second...
Idyia: Here, is this it?
Klee: Wow! A huge shell!
Paimon: It's the relic that Kokomi mentioned earlier! So this is where it's been hiding!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It was once a ritual vessel used for making offerings in the Mouun Shrine. It's made from the remains of a youkai called the shinkirou, and it can listen to the wishes of those who come to pray to build up "shinki," which gives it its power.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Several centuries ago, the relic was lost when the last Prefect of Yashiori died in battle. Its final resting place was unknown...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The pearl that goes with it should be able to sense the casket's location. But when, unbeknownst to anyone at the time, the casket disappeared inside the core of the Veluriyam Mirage, the pearl's light died out.
Klee: Huh? How come?
Kaeya: Well, imagine it was a sound instead of light. If the room is too big, you can't hear anything from outside the door, can you?
Klee: Ohhh! I get it now. The shell must've been having too much fun one day, and got locked in the solitary confinement room.
Idyia: I understand now, too! The core has been wearing out recently... That's why you were able to follow the pearl all the way here.
Traveler: (Sounds just like my Treasure Compasses...)
Sangonomiya Kokomi: ...To get back to the story, without the offerings at the shrine, this vessel quickly loses its power...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Yet countless people who have visited this domain brought their wishes with them, and left a small piece of themselves behind along with their gifts. These have the same effect as the offerings at the shrine.
Idyia: Wow... I never knew this thing was so powerful...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It is. Powerful enough to help you repair the Veluriyam Mirage, with any luck.
Idyia: But... what do I do with it...?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It's simple. We just need to awaken it by telling it what we wish for.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: For example... My name is Sangonomiya Kokomi, the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: And my wish is to use my critical thinking and strategic planning skills to bring a little more joy into the lives of my fellow Watatsumi Islanders, as well as the lives of everyone I cherish.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Idyia, what do you wish for?
Idyia: Me? I...
Idyia: My wish is that all those who have sojourned to the Veluriyam Mirage in the past will achieve what they truly wish for. Not just in this domain, but out there, too.
Idyia: Even though I know full well that trying to build a railway in the outside world is just a pipe dream... and that Maymunah will probably just go back to being a scholar...
Idyia: And I know that Zosimos has a lot of improving to do as a playwright... it's going to be tough for him back in Fontaine. Chasing your dreams is hard work!
Idyia: Despite all of that, I still hope...
Idyia: That somehow, someday, they will achieve their dreams.
Traveler: Aha, I figured...

## Talk 4

Klee: Yay, Idyia, you're back to normal!
Idyia: ...
Traveler: Are you alright?
Idyia: Everyone's praise and curious questions went to my head... I said so many things I'm so ashamed of, and I... I lost the courage to live on.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Please don't say that. Yours was a noble wish.
Collei: Yeah. And you weren't granting wishes for yourself. You did it for other people.
Collei: I have friends like that, too! Other people's hopes and dreams are what motivate them. They'll work tirelessly just to see them smile.
Collei: If you ask me... That's one of the most noble things a person can aspire to.
Idyia: Please, no more praise... I—I'm really not comfortable with it... It makes me feel so ashamed...
Idyia: Someone like me doesn't deserve so many people's praise... It's like I'm dreaming.
Eula: Well, at least the domain is fixed now. And all the components are back in place.
Klee: Mmm...
Kaeya: What's the matter, Klee?
Klee: I suddenly have loads and loads of more wishes! I wanna ride the Choo-Choo Cart again, and look down from up on top of the big wheel!
Klee: Is there a way to get up on top of the wheel, Idyia?
Idyia: There is a way, but there's only space for a very few people...
Klee: #That's okay, I can go up by myself! ...Um, but it'd be more fun with Mr. Honorary Knight...
Traveler: I shall not leave your side, my lady.
Paimon: Are we sure about this? It's so high...
Paimon: What happens if we fall off?
Traveler: ...I thought you could fly?
Paimon: Well yeah, but... Paimon's just worried for you!
Idyia: Don't worry, I'll be there to make sure no one falls off. I haven't been up there in a long time myself.

## Talk 5

Klee: It's like doing a jigsaw puzzle...

## Talk 6

Idyia: Whenever people have to leave this domain, I like to come up here and spend some time alone after I've seen them out.
Idyia: They're always overjoyed when they first arrive and start bringing their imaginations to life...
Idyia: But once they realize that they can't take anything home with them, they get upset. Some of them can't bear to leave, others regret ever setting foot in this place.
Klee: Do you ever get sad, Idyia?
Idyia: ...I feel lonely, at times. But not sad.
Idyia: A lot of people destroy everything they created before leaving. But some don't, like the residents you met.
Idyia: Before they left, they asked me to make replicas of themselves using Hydro Eidolons. Then they tasked these replicas with maintaining everything they built here... as if this was their way of keeping their dreams alive.
Paimon: That's beautiful.
Idyia: Yeah. I don't know how they're faring in the outside world, but... just the thought that one day, they might achieve their dreams, and live on the outside just as their counterparts do in here... That's enough to make me happy.
Idyia: It feels like... I'm here waiting for them in the future, where they've achieved everything they wanted.
Traveler: You're so nice, Idyia.
Idyia: Uhh... really?
Idyia: ...I just think that every dream, every wish, is like a flame in a bottle.
Idyia: Whether someone is still working towards their dream, or living it already...
Idyia: As long as whenever they think back to that spark of light within them, it still makes them smile fondly... That's all it takes.
Klee: Well, I feel super happy right now!
Idyia: Haha, then I guess I've finally paid Alice back after all these years. Funny to think I've been in the middle of a desert this whole time... it's just a giant muddy swamp to me...
Paimon: Time for Paimon to give you a nickname! Mud Fairy! Watch out for Idyia the Mud Fairy.
Idyia: How dare you mock me! Roar, I'll gobble you up in one mouthful!
Idyia: ...I'm still embarrassed to have shown you my uglier side, but I'm glad the Veluriyam Mirage is up and running again. This place is going to be bustling with activity again soon enough. I hope you'll take some time to enjoy yourselves.
Traveler: Well, we still have some dreams to attend to...
Klee: Yep, I wanna get everyone together...
Klee: For one last ride on the Choo-Choo Cart!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Sangonomiya Kokomi: Umm... If I remember correctly, I think there's supposed to be a small cog on the right-hand side.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: So maybe that's the candy box?

### Additional Talk 2

Eula: Mm... I guess it'll be time for us to leave once this is fixed.

### Additional Talk 3

Kaeya: What's making that shadow? Is it the rope?
Kaeya: Hmm... I feel like the rope should go from one part to another to connect them together...

### Additional Talk 4

Zosimos: You're going to attempt to repair the core now, right? I hope it goes smoothly.
Zosimos: I feel so honored to have met you all. You were a wonderful cast! Thank you once again. I'm so grateful for everything you have done for me.

### Additional Talk 5

Idyia: Wait, this is Zosimos's bottle-lamp...
Idyia: Try sticking it in somewhere where there's a gap. Maybe on the right.

### Additional Talk 6

Idyia: "Welcome to the Veluriyam Mirage. I hope you can relax and enjoy some respite from your tiring journey."
Idyia: That's how I would have greeted you if things had been different... *sigh* It's hard to believe how much has happened.
Idyia: Since everything's fixed now, I thought... Better late than never. What do you think? Pretty professional, huh?
