# Scenes from Life in Meropide: Fists of Fury


## Talk 1

Nizami: Young warrior, will you spar with me?
Paimon: Uh, this is super sudden...
Nizami: #Whatever you say, {M#lad}{F#lass} with golden hair. I can tell that you're a veteran with just one look.
Nizami: I'm really bored, because no one has been sparring with me. If you will, I'll give you Coupons! I won a lot of those from Roussimoff, and I haven't figured out how to spend them yet.
Nizami: How about it?

## Talk 2

Nizami: #You sure left me hanging, {M#lad}{F#lass}. Hope you remember that we weren't finished!
Nizami: Enough talk. Let's do this!

## Talk 3

Nizami: #Are you free now, {M#lad}{F#lass}? Spar with me!

## Talk 4

Nizami: Ha! Exhilarating!
Nizami: #I knew it, {M#lad}{F#lass}! You're a worthy opponent!
Traveler: You're not bad, either.
Nizami: It seems I need to work harder.
Nizami: Anyway, I'm a straight-shooter, just like you. Here are your Coupons. Let's do this again sometime!
Traveler: You've got some ways to go.
Nizami: #You don't mince your words, {M#lad}{F#lass}. I like that!
