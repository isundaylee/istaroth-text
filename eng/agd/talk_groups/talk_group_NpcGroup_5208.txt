Traveler: Are you a researcher?
Chisseray: I was. But I don't do that now. I just help Mr. Raimondo by organizing files and documents.
Chisseray: Looking back, I should have quit way earlier and let that old fool Bossuet write his own boring papers... It's the only thing he's good for anyway.

Traveler: And Bossuet is...
Chisseray: He's an old fogey whose vision has already started to go, a researcher without an ounce of creativity, an honorary clothes rack that thinks the world of himself, a bloodsucker who feeds on the research of others and is utterly useless without his subordinates.

Traveler: He sounds very... special.
Chisseray: He is. And if I'd realized sooner how "special" he is and made up my mind to quit, my life would have been much easier.
