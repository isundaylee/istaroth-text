# Cake for Traveler

A gift given to a very special someone on a very special day.

Here's to you, busy as you are in this land.
Wishing you a joyous journey in this great big world.

"Every week, the recommended dishes get updated. Every month, the moon sends down new blessings â€” but wow, it's going to be almost nine thousand hours more before we can celebrate this day again! And by that, Paimon means that she'll accompany you all the way, Traveler!"
