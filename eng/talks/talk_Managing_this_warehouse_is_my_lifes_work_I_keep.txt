Gou San'er: Managing this warehouse is my life's work. I keep my eye on the Mingxiao Lantern all the time.
Gou San'er: I make sure that everyone's donations get put to use: every sheet of paper, every strand of lamp wick, every chunk of Plaustrite...
Gou San'er: ...Oi, you! No belts! Belts don't work as lamp wicks, moron! Fetch it back from the pile, please.
