# Impromptu Poem of the Crimson Dawn


## Talk 1

Redhead: It's almost time. Let's set out for the Treasure Hoarder hideout in the south.

## Talk 2

Redhead: So we meet again! Didn't you say you had a gift for us? Some broken ribs, if I recall correctly? I appreciate the sentiment, but I personally think that's a present that suits you far better.
Jingle: You liar! You never intended on letting us go!
Redhead: Well, I would say the same to you!

## Talk 3

Jingle: You're ganging up on us!
Havisham: This ain't hardly fair.
Bleu: Boss, what should we do with them?
Redhead: Why not ask our friends over there?
Traveler: Are you guys robbers as well?
Redhead: Oh, that's a toughie. Yes and no.
Blanc: We only target bad guys, like these two here.
Paimon: Paimon's not sure Paimon entirely follows, but what Paimon does know is that these two are bad guys. They tried to rob us earlier!
Paimon: After that, you said that you'd give them valuable cargo for free, and lured the bad guys here into an ambush!
Paimon: That means you and the other two must be...
Traveler: Undercover law enforcement officers.
Jingle: Lapdogs of the Maison Gardiennage? Pfft. You make me sick.
Redhead: Unfortunately for me, that's not the case. I don't agree with the things they do in pursuit of justice... but at least it is justice that they're after.
Redhead: That's something you lying good-for-nothings could never understand.
Redhead: Anyway, we're just a bunch of nobodies, but even nobodies have the right to believe in a cause, especially when it concerns matters of justice. There's no way we'd turn a blind eye to transgressions happening right in front of us.
Redhead: They have committed terrible crimes here. And even though they promised to let you walk free, they never intended to actually let that happen.
Paimon: How do you know what they're actually thinking?
Redhead: You must listen carefully, not only with your ears, but with your head, too.
Traveler: (Speaking of which, Penny did say...)
Black Screen Text: You take a few deep breaths to cast aside a few unwanted thoughts and clear your head.
Redhead: Try to recall what they said.
Redhead: "All that for some{RUBY#[D]What an idiot!}one you've never met... You have a heart {RUBY#[D]If your heart was real gold, then we'd be in business.}of gold, my friend! I'm so {RUBY#[D]Gold or not, I'm gonna rip it right out.}touched."
Redhead: #"We are men {RUBY#[D]As if verbal agreements amount to anything.}of our word. We'll let you walk free today, bro{RUBY#[D]We'll be back to finish you once we're done with this moron.}, and take your pet with you!"
Traveler: Whoa, that's scary.
Paimon: You, scared? Paimon's not buying it for a second.
Paimon: Paimon's seen this all before. Bad guys never change, and words take on different meanings once you process them.
Jingle: What do you mean "what we a{RUBY#[D]They must be bluffing.}ctually think"... We say what{RUBY#[D]I'm not gonna fall for this.} we mean! It's {RUBY#[D]Nope!}true!
Havisham: We just got carried away, that's all. {RUBY#[D]Well, maybe once or twice. Three times?} This has never happened before. We've learned {RUBY#[D]We've got to get backup.}our lesson!
Jingle: Here, take our loot{RUBY#[D]Most of our stuff is back at camp.}. It's all yours. Life has not {RUBY#[D](bad luck running into this lot)}been kind to us, or else we would never have{RUBY#[D]We'd better warn the others.} stooped as low as robbing.
Havisham: Please give us another chance! We'll {RUBY#[D]Once we're back at camp, we'll get the others. You're gonna pay!}make an honest living in Lumidouce Harbor.
Jingle: Of co{RUBY#[D]As if...}urse.
Havisham: As we {RUBY#[D]They sound delusional}have said, so have {RUBY#[D]But that makes things easier}you heard.
Redhead: Okay, then. We'll believe you once more. Bleu, Blanc, let them go.
Blanc: Alright.
Jingle: We promise to {RUBY#[D]Call for backup}become better men.
Havisham: And we will thank you {RUBY#[D]with some broken ribs}properly in the future!
Black Screen Text: Having said their piece, the two Treasure Hoarders hurriedly head south.
Paimon: How could you let them go? Paimon's sure you heard their thoughts as clearly as we did.
Redhead: What's the hurry? Since you heard their thoughts, you must be aware that not only do they plan to continue with their crimes, but that they also have plenty of accomplices.
Traveler: So you're playing the long game.
Redhead: Bingo. This is the perfect opportunity for all the fish to swim into our net. I'd be an idiot to let this slip by.
Paimon: #But what if there are too many of them? Can we come with you? Traveler knows a few moves.
Traveler: If you hadn't led them away in the first place...
Paimon: If you had saved this guy, their master plan would have been foiled!
Redhead: Since you're willing to help, I'll give Bleu and Blanc a day off.
Blanc: Hmm?
Bleu: Fine with me. The boss calls the shots.
Redhead: Those two lying weasels have returned to their camp to rally their brethren. Let's give them some time, then pay a visit tomorrow evening.
Paimon: No problem. By the way, we still don't know your name.
Redhead: Name? It's just a codename, but you may call me Rouge.
Paimon: Rouge... We've heard that name before, from Penny! Now that Paimon thinks of it, it did sound oddly familiar when you were going on about listening with your head.
Redhead: You know Penny? She's spoken to you about me? What a coincidence.
Redhead: Small world we live in...
Traveler: Robbing bad guys every now and then is a hobby of mine as well.
Paimon: Paimon's sure you meant to say "punishing," right?
Traveler: It's no surprise to me.
Traveler: Someone even worse than the bad guys!
Redhead: Haha! If you want to teach unsavory characters a lesson, you must become yet more unsavory. Looks like you already know that.

## Talk 4

Redhead: There's some cargo here. It looks like the gang has been busy... but I think they'll take the hint this time around.
Redhead: Since you've done your part, you should have some of these as well.
Traveler: It feels weird... I'll pass.
Redhead: Suit yourself. Thank you anyway! I fear I don't have anything else to offer you except my gratitude.
Traveler: What are you gonna do with the loot?
Redhead: Give to those in need, of course.
Redhead: Oh, I get it now. You thought I was gonna keep this all to myself. If I were to do that, I'd be no different from them.
Paimon: So, like, what do you really plan to do?
Redhead: I meant what I said to Havisham and Jingle. I'm sure you know that by now.
Redhead: The world is full of extreme inequity, poverty, and greed.
Redhead: Some people resort to a life of crime only because they have encountered difficulties that they believe are insurmountable. I would love to lend those people a hand.
Redhead: Havisham and Jingle, on the other hand, belong to the other group: those marred by insatiable greed, who resort to violence to rob the weak and seize what doesn't belong to them.
Redhead: If the laws of Fontaine cannot ensure that they receive the punishment they deserve, then I will. Whatever your opinion, I will continue doing what I believe to be the right thing.
Traveler: I'm sure you have your reasons.
Redhead: You could call this arrogance, which in turn could be construed as another form of greed.
Redhead: Fortunately, I'm not alone on this path, and there are like-minded people by my side. Even if we can make just a tiny difference in the world...
Redhead: Thanks all the same! Farewell!
