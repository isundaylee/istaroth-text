Traveler: Are you not going to play with your "Aunt"?
Takeru: "Aunt"? Oh, you mean that old hag? She's such a sore loser â€” I'm not gonna play with her!
Takeru: Every time she loses, she pulls a long face and says "You have to listen to me, you're my nephew." And she's not even as tall as me! Aaand she's always trying to cheat!
Takeru: But I won't hold a grudge against her. I'm the man who's gonna become as strong as Ryuuji, after all!
