# Astrology and the 50-Year Pact


## Talk 1

Paimon: Found it! This must be the ring!
Paimon: It's so pretty. Paimon's sure it's worth a ton of...
Paimon: ...Ah, Paimon wasn't having any bad thoughts! Let's bring the ring back to <color=#00E1FFFF>Mr. Zhu</color>!

## Talk 2

Mona: There is a small inn near <color=#00E1FFFF>Mt. Tianheng</color> that never sees a lot of business, even though its food is always great value for the money.
Mona: The owner has always been good to me, so I'd like to say a farewell before I set off.

## Talk 3

Paimon: The Elemental Bait's really strong — it will attract all the slimes in the area.
Paimon: Even if they're just slimes, they can be dangerous together, so we'd best prepare ourselves.

## Talk 4

Mr. Zhu: That's it, that's the one! I thought it was lost forever!
Mona: You actually found it. Not bad.
Mona: Mr. Zhu, you must take care of such precious things a bit better. You might not be so fortunate next time.
Mr. Zhu: You're absolutely right. How would I have faced my family if I had lost the 253rd ring my mother gave me?
Traveler: ...
Mr. Zhu: Ah, let me explain. My family owns three jade mines, and in order to ensure that I would be able to find myself a good wife, my mother had many jade accessories made as heirlooms.
Mr. Zhu: I think there might be over five hundred of them.
Mona: Then, why would you feel the need to set up an inn here?
Mr. Zhu: Well, inheriting the family business too early unavoidably made things boring.
Mr. Zhu: Thank you, all the same. Here's the Mora, as agreed. Please take it.
Paimon: Then—
Mona: —Then I'll take it gladly!
Traveler: That was quick!
Paimon: But we did all the work!
Mona: A disciple should act like one. How can they steal their master's thunder?
Traveler: Well...
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, didn't we say we were just playing pretend?
Mona: Well, you need to start practicing now. If my rival is as smart as I think they are, they will figure you out in a heartbeat.
Mona: *stomach grumble*
Mona: Huh...
Paimon: What was that rumbling sound?
Mr. Zhu: Oh, right, you mustn't have eaten in days. I'm very sorry, I forgot that you have no...
Mona: Aaaaaaah—! Shhhhahahahaha! That didn't happen! Forget it!
Mona: ...Hmph! Well, I suddenly feel that you have indeed contributed to our good fortune. I say we spend this money on treating you to a fine meal!
Mona: If we travel north, we'll reach the <color=#00E1FFFF>Wangshu Inn</color>. I hear that the food there is really good, so let's go try it out!
Mona: No need to thank me, I'm just doing as a good master should!
Paimon: Did she say she was treating us!? Is Paimon hearing things?
Traveler: "Let's go after her." There. I said it for you.
Paimon: Let's go after her! For good food!
Traveler: "She's a good person." Said it for you.
Paimon: She's such a good person! Hehe, let's have ourselves a great meal!
Traveler: I never said I'd really be your disciple.
Paimon: Exactly!
Traveler: Even Paimon wasn't that fast!
Traveler: ...
Traveler: ... ... ...

## Talk 5

Mr. Zhu: Thank you all very much, that ring really is very important to me.

## Talk 6

Paimon: (Well, it's no wonder that an inn set up here has no business...)
Mr. Zhu: Mona, you've come at just the right time. Did you see a jade ring while you made your way here?
Mona: A jade ring? Can't say I have.
Mr. Zhu: Oh, that's not good... that ring was given to me by my mother. But while my back was turned, it was swallowed up by a slime!
Paimon: Hmm? That should be no trouble with Mona here. She's really good at astrology...
Mona: Absolutely not. Astrology is meant to be used to gain insight into reality and observe destiny itself. It's certainly not for such mundane affairs.
Paimon: But didn't you say that the owner here's been good to you?
Mona: This is a matter of pride and one's state of mind. If an astrologist thinks that their arts can solve all problems, they will be forsaken by the starry ether.
Mona: Their divinations will lose the power to guide, and will not be able to pierce the fog of the unknown before them. Principles are principles.
Paimon: Such a powerful ability, and you don't use it to earn a living? What a shame...
Mr. Zhu: *sigh* Well, I was going to put up twenty thousand Mora as compensation, if you were willing.
Traveler: Are you alright?
Traveler: What's with that look on your face?
Mona: Twenty thousand...!
Traveler: You were just talking about an astrologist's pride...
Traveler: Whatever happened to "principles are principles"?
Mona: Oh, ahh, it's nothing! I... I was just thinking that the person who finds that ring must be lucky indeed, to be able to earn twenty thousand Mora just like that.
Mona: Ahem. Yes. Of course. Still... the owner's business has had it pretty hard. It must be a truly extraordinary ring, to be worth spending this much Mora to find.
Mona: It wouldn't be right for us to leave like this, so let's help to search for it. There may be other means we can employ besides astrology.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon knows where this is going.
Traveler: But of course...
Traveler: Guess it's become my business. Again.
Mona: #{NICKNAME}, I know, I'll leave this one to you! This is the first mission I'm giving you as your master!
Paimon: Hmm, since it was swallowed up by a slime, maybe we can use Elemental Bait to lure all the nearby slimes to us.
Paimon: Did you know? It's something that the Dawn Winery accidentally refined while making wine...
Paimon: The formula is a secret, but it's really good at attracting slimes.
Traveler: Well done Paimon!
Traveler: Don't tell me that when you get greedy, you...
Paimon: And... Hehe, Paimon actually kept a small amount!
Paimon: Paimon's the very best partner, right?
Paimon: Aw, don't sweat the small stuff.
Mona: Seems like you already have a plan.
Paimon: Yup. We'll be back in a jiffy!

## Talk 7

Mona: This is your first mission, so don't mess it up.
Mona: But if the going gets too tough for you... Well, I shall lend a hand then.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Traveler: It's been a while.
Traveler: You're Mona!
Mona: Does my ability to see through your secrets so easily not evoke any memories?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon remembers! You're that astrologist!
Mona: That's right. It is I, Astrologist Mona Megistus.
Mona: This time, I would like you to come with me to Mondstadt to reclaim a box that belongs to my master.
Mona: It was part of an agreement she made with a friend 50 years ago. But she isn't as spry as she used to be, so now it's up to me.
Paimon: Not sure what getting some box back has to do with us. Why do you need us to come along?
Mona: Well... that's because I would also like to take on the guardian of the box.
Traveler: So you want to prove yourself, huh...
Traveler: So basically, you want to look good.
Mona: My master and her friend contended in the mystic arts all their lives without a clear victor. If I triumph here, then I will show myself to be superior to my master!
Mona: Ahem, well, I want to prove the power and status of astrology, to be precise.
Mona: What are you talking about? The main thing here is to use this chance to prove the power and status of astrology!
Mona: Now, from my predictions, I know that my master's friend has left Mondstadt, leaving her successor as the current guardian of that box.
Mona: Like me, that successor must also be one who has surpassed their teacher. I must not be careless.
Traveler: But... I have no idea how astrology works.
Traveler: How did you end up thinking of me?
Mona: But I would prefer to assure my victory in this contest, and upon giving it some thought, you came to mind!
Paimon: #How did {M#he}{F#she} get involved in this anyway?
Mona: The knowledge passed down to me from my master must be passed on in turn.
Mona: If I were to bring my disciple to meet her, then the lead is already mine, no?
Traveler: I refuse.
Traveler: Since when was I your student?
Mona: And you are Mondstadt's great hero, my equal in status. So...
Mona: Come on, you don't have to actually become my disciple. You just need to act the part.
Mona: There's something in it for you as well, should you come with me to get that box.
Mona: Once I meet that successor and have a chance to exchange knowledge with them, I should be able to read your fate more accurately.
Mona: Then, I will have answers for you, even regarding such distant and foggy matters as gods and kin.
Traveler: Those sound like fine conditions.
Traveler: Well... I guess we'll play along.
Paimon: That does seem much faster than searching the land country by country!
Mona: Hehe, a wise decision.
Mona: That said, I would like to pay a certain place a visit before we go.
