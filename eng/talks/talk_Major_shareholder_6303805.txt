Traveler: Major shareholder?
Aikawa Susumu: Indeed. While I was away in Natlan, I was inspired to return to Inazuma and open a hot spring hotel. As I didn't possess the funds myself, I began to look around for investors.
Aikawa Susumu: In the end, a clinical psychologist who had been living among the People of the Springs — none other than the venerable Yumemizuki Mizuki herself — caught wind of my endeavors.
Aikawa Susumu: She was very supportive of the idea of opening a hot spring hotel in Inazuma, so she invested a large sum.
Aikawa Susumu: While my neighbors in Inazuma City may have taken to calling me "Boss," the real boss of the Aisa Bathhouse is undoubtedly Miss Yumemizuki.
Aikawa Susumu: At most, I'm just a manager in charge of commercial operations. As for the key decisions on business and development, those are all taken by Miss Yumemizuki.
Aikawa Susumu: Once she returned to Inazuma, she made some changes and improvements to the hot springs' operations. The results have been nothing short of miraculous...
Aikawa Susumu: If you've been troubled by anxiety, you should have a word with Miss Yumemizuki. I'm sure she'll be able to work wonders for you!
