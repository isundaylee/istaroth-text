Mavuika: Did you set up this office just for me? Aw. That's so nice of you.
Mavuika: Whenever I need space to think, I pace around in the Speaker's Chamber and before I realize it, I find myself tinkering with the furnishings. Or doing even weirder things.
Mavuika: For example, I might wipe down the lampshade of the phlogiston lamp several times over, or start cantering around on the wooden alpaca carving... It actually works, okay? Don't knock it till you've tried it.
