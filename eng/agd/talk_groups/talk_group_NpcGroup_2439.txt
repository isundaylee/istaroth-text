Traveler: I'm fine.
Yinxing: Oh, that's great, then!
Yinxing: I'm the ship's doctor. Seasickness, wind chills, amputations, I do them all around here.
Yinxing: You can have full confidence in my skills. If there's anything at all, you can come to me!
Yinxing: Of course, it's best to stay healthy. But always remember, having too little fear of danger is the most dangerous thing of all!

Traveler: On my... back?
Yinxing: Oh! I'm sorry!
Yinxing: I... When we dock at Liyue Harbor, I often take care of injured cats and the like.
Yinxing: Over time, I've started talking to people in the same way. Please don't take offense.
Yinxing: Now that I mention it, I left some small stray kittens in the hands of a Millelith soldier named Yong'an the last time. I wonder how they're doing now...
