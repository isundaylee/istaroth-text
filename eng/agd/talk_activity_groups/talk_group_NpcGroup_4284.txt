Zurvan: This isn't a place anyone can just wander into, trespasser.

## Talk

Zurvan: I leave it to you to help Sorush out.

## Talk

Traveler: About the Sign of Apaosha...
Zurvan: The appearance of the Sign of Apaosha is a result of the constant build-up of defilement.
Zurvan: The last time such an occurrence happened was centuries ago. I, along with some human warriors, set about eradicating it.
Zurvan: Should the defilement be allowed to erode the structure of the Harvisptokhm, then once the filth grows too much for the Khvarena to contain, the Tunigi Hollow's rift might just reopen.

## Talk

Traveler: About the Pari...
Zurvan: We Pari exist to avert the catastrophe and cleanse the defilement.
Zurvan: The divine bird Simurgh drank the Amrita and mixed her Khvarena with the water's essence, thus creating countless beings.
Zurvan: Amongst the countless motes of Khvarena, the ones blessed with sentience are us, the Pari.
Zurvan: Our power comes from the primordial Amrita, and one day, so too will our power flow back to its source.

## Talk

Traveler: About Sorush...
Zurvan: Don't mind her tough talk. She is a good petal at heart.
Zurvan: Sorush was born after the dust of the previous catastrophe settled, and hasn't witnessed the war of old. Hence, she holds many fantasies as to how things were.
Zurvan: However, every Pari has a fated responsibility. From this perspective, she is unique. Even I cannot fully comprehend the mysteries of the Khvarena...

## Talk

Traveler: It's alright.
Zurvan: Then, I wish you the best and look forward to hearing the good news!

## Talk

Zurvan: Ah. We meet again. Did you miss me that much?

## Talk

Traveler: About the Sign of Apaosha...
Zurvan: Thanks to you, the Sign of Apaosha has been entirely extinguished.
Zurvan: Although the power of the defilement can never be fully eradicated, should it wish to return and infest this place, then it may just take a little longer yet.
Zurvan: We Pari will also take this chance to rest and recuperate.

## Talk

Traveler: About Sorush...
Zurvan: Ah, Sorush has grown quite a bit. It seems she is indeed worthy of the Bloomguard title. Of course, much of this is thanks to your influence.
Zurvan: Please continue to instruct her for what is to come.

## Talk

Traveler: About the former generations of the Order of Skeptics...
Zurvan: They claimed to be those that once fought side by side with the heroes of Dahri.
Zurvan: Although I never met any Dahri aside from that swordsman, any who face the beasts of corruption stands as our ally.
Zurvan: Our battle against the defilement will continue on forever. In the face of such an ever-lasting conflict, the regards of humanity is meaningless.

## Talk

Traveler: Farewell.
Zurvan: We shall meet again.
