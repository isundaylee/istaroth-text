Traveler: About the outlanders in Ritou...
Kurisu: Since the head of the Hiiragi Clan was removed from his post, all the affairs of the Kanjou Commission have been well-regulated.
Kurisu: Taxes were reduced, and the officials and soldiers made things less difficult for the merchants. Everyone is really relieved.
Kurisu: However, there is still a lot to be done here. The source of goods, delivery routes and channels... There are still many things to settle.
Kurisu: Anyway, the Trade Association and I have dedicated ourselves to providing every outlander with support.
