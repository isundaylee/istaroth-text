Traveler: Is there anything noteworthy nearby?

## Talk

Mermet: I haven't seen anything noteworthy. I've had a lot on my plate with work lately and haven't had the energy to pay much attention to anything else.

## Talk

Mermet: Really, it's not my fault...

## Talk

Traveler: What happened?
Mermet: I was reprimanded because I accidentally gave the wrong route while guiding a cargo ship, and it almost ran aground.
Mermet: Okay, fine, I'll admit it's partially my fault, but you can't pin all the blame on me.
Mermet: The routine hydrological surveys at the harbor have been suspended for a while now, so my charts haven't been updated for ages.
Mermet: If I had the latest hydrological charts, this kind of problem wouldn't have occurred in the first place.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Mermet: Goodbye. I need to continue studying these hydrological charts...

## Talk

Traveler: Are you in charge of helping ships navigate the waters here?
Mermet: Don't you know? The hydrological conditions near Lumidouce Harbor are extremely complex. There are shallows, rifts, and even reefs.
Mermet: That's why the port usually assigns a navigator to board the cargo ships whenever they're entering or leaving the harbor. They help plot a course to guide the ships safely.
Mermet: But due to the recent... complications at Lumidouce Harbor, many navigators have resigned. Those of us who remain are overworked.
Mermet: *sigh* I wonder when this will all finally come to an end...

## Talk

Traveler: Those hydrological surveys you just mentioned...
Mermet: Oh, yeah... We need to do them because the underwater environment can sometimes shift, you know?
Mermet: Currents could cause a sunken ship to drift over and end up blocking one route, while the same currents might simultaneously open up another route that was previously impassable...
Mermet: To facilitate navigation, our harbor usually hires specialists every once in a while to conduct a comprehensive survey of the waters near Lumidouce Harbor.
Mermet: They create updated hydrological charts, which are then distributed to all the navigators.
Mermet: But for some reason, it's been forever and a day since the harbor last organized a hydrological survey. We've been navigating based on outdated charts and experience.
Mermet: That's why I almost got into serious hot water.

## Talk

Traveler: How do you guys plan to proceed?
Mermet: I heard that Ms. Cassigneul is planning on conducting another comprehensive hydrological survey.
Mermet: While that's a good thing, hydrological surveys don't happen overnight. We have no idea when it'll be completed, but we can't afford to suspend the harbor's operations in the meantime.
Mermet: So until then, we'll just have to rely on our experience and intuition.

Mermet: Duel

## Talk

Mermet: Phew, that was tough! You're way better than those sailors!

## Talk

Mermet: Agh... I lost, just as I thought I would. You make those sailors look like a bunch of amateurs!
