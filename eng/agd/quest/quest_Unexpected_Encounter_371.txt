# Unexpected Encounter


## Talk 1

Paimon: There's something you didn't tell them.
Paimon: The dragon and the crystal weren't the only things we saw.
Traveler: I'd like to investigate it on my own first.
Paimon: So you do remember him, that green guy.
Paimon: He looked just like that guy down there!
Traveler: The exact same shade of green, what a coincidence.
Paimon: See? See?
Paimon: Wait... Hold on a minute... That...
Paimon: That's the same guy!
Traveler: Well... Looks like him...
Paimon: What!?
Traveler: I don't think he's a bad guy.

## Talk 2

Paimon: That green guy disappeared!
Paimon: Use *Elemental Sight* to track him down.

## Talk 3

Paimon: His footprints lead to this wall. Did he *climb up* from here?
Traveler: Let's go after him!
