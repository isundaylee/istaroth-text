Haniyyah: Judging by your faces, it seems like you two still have some questions, yes?
Haniyyah: Don't worry, you can be more casual with me. You've both helped me a great deal, so I'll tell you all I know.
Traveler: So, about keeping the Fungi...
Paimon: Yeah, that's what we wanted to ask about.
Paimon: We didn't take Bongo-Head with us previously for fairness's sake, so it wouldn't look like we were making ourselves the exception to the final decision.
Paimon: It's been some time since the tournament, though, so if we're able to communicate with our shroom buddies without having to rely on Wisdom Orbs...
Paimon: We can keep Bongo-Head with us, can't we?
Haniyyah: I have considered that as well, yes.
Haniyyah: Supposing that you could find a place devoid of other residents or animals, this would be fine — in theory.
Haniyyah: Although our Fungi friends are quite well-behaved, they might be angered if challenged by animals like Forest Boars.
Traveler: We have the Serenitea Pot.
Paimon: But we do have guests and animals in there at times, don't we?
Paimon: Tubby would be really troubled if the Fungi were to get into fights with the other animals...
Paimon: Perhaps we should ask Tubby first. Maybe she'd have some ideas!
Haniyyah: I'm also looking for new security measures, such as road signs or fences that have special spores on them that will cause Fungi to automatically remain within a specific area.
Haniyyah: Perhaps we might be able to separate the living areas of the Fungi from that of other animals, thus preventing conflict.
Haniyyah: If something looks particularly promising, I'll inform you right away.
Traveler: Alright then, let's all do our best!
Paimon: Thanks, Haniyyah!
Traveler: The Realm Within is quite spacious.
Traveler: Tell me more about the Marvelous Jellies...
Haniyyah: Not to worry, I commissioned Ms. Najah from the Amurta to make these, and they serve as rations for the Fungi.
Haniyyah: The Jellies don't contain any medicinal components, only nutritional ones.
Haniyyah: We can use these Jellies to avoid the Fungi absorbing too many nutrients from the soil, which will prevent them from spoiling rainforest ecosystems.
Haniyyah: We can also add components to the Jellies according to the personalities of each Fungus to improve their mood.
Paimon: Ooh, so you can do that too, huh? We can try to figure out Bongo-Head's favorite flavor, then?
Traveler: Do you want to give it a go, Paimon?
Paimon: Nah! Floral Jellies and Marvelous Jellies all look pretty delicious, but Paimon's not so hard up that she'd need to eat food meant for Fungi!
Paimon: Well, let's feed Bongo-Head and Kindlejoy some Marvelous Jellies later, shall we?
Traveler: I'd like to hear your review once you're done eating it...
Traveler: So, about your funding...
Paimon: Paimon's got the same concerns, Haniyyah. Have you encountered any lack of Mora while taking care of the Fungi all this time?
Haniyyah: Please do not worry.
Haniyyah: I can secure food via fishing and hunting in the rainforest, and our shroom buddies can get the nutrients they need from the soil.
Haniyyah: Other than clothes, daily necessities, and the funds required to make Marvelous Jellies, I don't really have many expenses to worry about.
Haniyyah: I still have quite a large amount of savings left over from my work training Sumpter Beasts for merchant caravans. I've got enough for decades, even.
Paimon: W—Wow... So that's what it's like to be a professional beast tamer!
Traveler: If you need anything, just let us know.
Haniyyah: I appreciate the sentiment. I promised to take good care of our shroom friends. As long as nothing goes awry, I won't add to your burdens.
Paimon: Huh, y'know what? That's kinda reassuring. When the opportunity comes around, let's treat Haniyyah to a nice meal plus some improved rations for our Fungi friends!
Traveler: We'll do our best to support you.
Traveler: We'll see you later.
Haniyyah: No problem. I'll be here, and you're free to drop by any time.

## Talk

Balfour: O great heroes, please, feel free to play Fungus Mechanicus to your heart's content!
Balfour: Is there anything else I can do for you, by the way? Name it, and I shall do my best to answer the call!
Traveler: Play Fungus Mechanicus
Traveler: About the next tournament...
Paimon: Yeah, speaking of that, we've been waiting for news about the Wisdom Orbs all this time, but we haven't really thought the arrangements of the next tournament through.
Paimon: #Well, Paimon's sure Traveler'll come up with a whole bunch of ideas when the time comes, so there's probably nothing to worry about.
Balfour: Indeed. And in any case, I have prepared a great many contingencies, which I hope will meet your expectations.
Balfour: When the time comes, just use your judgment, and should you encounter any troublesome trivialities, leave them to me!
Traveler: I'll do some research myself should I get the chance.
Paimon: Hehe, in that case, Paimon's gonna think about how to make the matches more exciting for the shrooms!
Traveler: Paimon and I will be the best organizers, just you wait.
Traveler: Tell me more about the promotion of Fungus Mechanicus...
Balfour: Oh, you can rest assured about that!
Balfour: Though the game is in its early test stages, it is open to all, and anyone who wants to can try it and make suggestions.
Balfour: I even extended invitations to some chess enthusiasts, Akademiya students, and Eremite mercenaries to test the game — we're going for the widest possible clientele coverage.
Balfour: Of course, your feedback shall be foremost amongst them, and we will put priority on making changes according to any suggestions you may make.
Balfour: The relevant people have been informed, so when the time comes, I will put the word out and increase the intensity of our advertising.
Paimon: Wow, this is so professional, Paimon's starting to get confused...
Paimon: Well, we'll just keep playing the game and give you our feedback so it can be the best it can be!
Paimon: And then with this game, we'll get everyone hyped up for the next Beast Tamers Tournament...
Paimon: #Looks like we've got lots of work to do, Traveler!
Traveler: Thanks for your hard work. Bye for now.
Balfour: Don't mention it. See you later, then!

## Talk

Paimon: Hey there, Bongo-Head, Kindlejoy! We're here to play with you!
Paimon: #What shall we do together with our shroom buddies, Traveler?
Traveler: Let's feed them, shall we?
Paimon: Sure! We had so much fun last time that we didn't notice the many Marvelous Jelly flavors available. Let's pay a bit more attention to the ones the shrooms prefer, shall we?
Traveler: Use the Valberry-flavored jellies.
Bongo-Head: ♪~
Pyro-1: ?
Paimon: Ooh, so Bongo-Head likes the Valberry-flavored ones, huh?
Paimon: Maybe we can squeeze lots of Valberry juice and let Bongo-Head soak in them next time...
Paimon: On the other hand, it seems like Kindlejoy isn't that keen... Maybe it doesn't like sweet stuff — that sure fits its personality!
Traveler: Use the Mint-flavored jellies.
Bongo-Head: ♪~
Pyro-1: ?
Paimon: Hey, looks like Bongo-Head loves minty-fresh flavors!
Paimon: Do you think it'll have tons of fun in a Mint field?
Paimon: Hmm... But it looks like Kindlejoy's not loving the cool flavors much.
Traveler: Use the Crab Roe-flavored jellies.
Paimon: Um, is this flavor really a thing? Haniyyah sure gets some... interesting ideas...
Bongo-Head: ♪~
Pyro-1: ♫~
Paimon: Huh, looks like Bongo-Head doesn't mind the flavor of Crab Roe at all!
Paimon: Kindlejoy seems pleased too. Looks like Crab Roe's the happy medium!
Paimon: It is kinda time-consuming to make Crab Roe, but it's a small sacrifice to make for our buddies, eh? Let's make some for them later!
Paimon: Once we know how to make Marvelous Jellies, we can whip up a great feast for them!
Traveler: Let's make some gestures at them, shall we?
Paimon: Hmm? That's true, it seems some people can use simple hand gestures to make animals understand what they mean.
Paimon: Let's give it a go — with our bond with our Fungi friends, we should have no problem!
Traveler: Give your Fungi friends a thumbs-up.
Paimon: Right, Paimon'll do it too. Thumbs up for good ol' Bongo-Head and the handsome Kindlejoy!
Bongo-Head: ♪~
Pyro-1: ♫~
Paimon: Hehe, looks like they're both mighty pleased. Let's give them more encouragement in the future!
Traveler: Waggle your index finger around in a circle.
Paimon: Are you asking them to turn around? Isn't that a bit complicated?
Bongo-Head: ♪~
Pyro-1: ♫~
Paimon: Hahaha, look at them go! They're so smart!
Paimon: It's almost like they're dancing. Maybe if Paimon danced too, Bongo-Head would be willing to be Paimon's dance partner!
Traveler: Point at Paimon with the right hand, left hand at your head.
Bongo-Head: ♪~
Paimon: Whoa, looks like Bongo-Head's coming over to let Paimon pat it!
Paimon: But, uh, Kindlejoy is...
Pyro-1: ♫~
Paimon: Wait! Stop, stop! Kindlejoy looks like it's about to jump on Paimon's head!
Traveler: Let's use different sounds to call out to them, shall we?
Paimon: Do you mean that we should try imitating other animals to see what sort of reaction we'll get from them?
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon wants to try that too!
Traveler: *roar*
Paimon: What kinda sound was that? Were you trying to imitate a Sumpter Beast? Paimon's never heard that one before, though...
Bongo-Head: ♪~
Pyro-1: ♫~
Paimon: Huh, looks like they're coming over...
Paimon: Do Fungi also stick to Sumpter Beasts for warmth when they feel cold?
Traveler: Meow~
Paimon: Haha, so you're a cat, huh? Alright, Paimon's joining in!
Bongo-Head: ?
Pyro-1: ?
Paimon: Huh, they seem kinda curious. Have they never seen a cat before?
Paimon: Well, guess that just means we should introduce them to some in the future and help them make some new friends!
Paimon: Speaking of which, would we call a cat that lives in the rainforest a Forest Cat?
Paimon: And if it makes friends with a Fungus, that makes it a Shroomcat!
Traveler: Ya!
Paimon: Hey, hey, that's not an animal you're imitating! You're gonna make our shroom buddies nervous!
Bongo-Head: !
Pyro-1: !
Paimon: See? They've been alerted now!
Paimon: #Don't worry, don't worry, there are no hilichurls around. Traveler's just joking.
Paimon: Hmm, guess this means that the shrooms can help us keep watch while we're asleep. They're pretty reliable, huh?
Traveler: We'll come back later and play with them.
Paimon: Huh, do we have something else to do? Well then, let's get to it quickly — then we can get back and continue playing with Bongo-Head and Kindlejoy!

## Talk

Souka: Hmm? Fancy meeting you here, "Twin Stars of Brilliant Valor"!
Traveler: That's a pretty nice nickname!
Paimon: It's been a while, Souka!
Paimon: And there you go with the nicknames again... But Paimon likes this one — it's cool, and it also emphasizes our super-awesome partnership!
Souka: Ah, it's good that you like it.
Paimon: So the contestant Haniyyah mentioned was you, huh? Why're you here in Sumeru by yourself?
Souka: Well, I was looking to regain the mindset I previously had during the tournament...
Souka: I'm about one-third of the way through writing my new book, but I feel like some of the parts I've written after that aren't quite right...
Souka: As time passed, I found that the inspiration that I got and the feelings that I held toward our Fungi partners began to fade and cool.
Paimon: Well, no matter how good your memory is, you won't quite be able to capture the joy of traveling together if you're apart from your companions for too long.
Souka: Exactly! So I asked Lady Yae to allow me to come to Sumeru for a long-term attachment, and she gladly agreed — she even sent me here with a letter of recommendation!
Souka: I searched in the rainforest for some time before finally finding Haniyyah's campsite. It was really well hidden, and didn't startle any of the surrounding animals at all!
Souka: She is very capable, and she takes great care of the Fungi, but I can at least help her share her burden.
Souka: When she heard why I'd come, she agreed to my request. She then taught me quite a few survival lessons, and tutored me on how to take care of Fungi.
Souka: I mean, I already enjoyed living together with them, so every day has been quite fulfilling.
Souka: Inspiration's also close at hand, so I believe that the rest of this book will be a cinch!
Traveler: A perfect decision!
Paimon: That's great! You get endless inspiration for your new book, and Haniyyah gets to take some of the load off her back!
Paimon: Still, we haven't seen your partner anywhere.
Paimon: Paimon thinks it was... Stormstress?
Souka: Stormstress has been helping us set up a new hut, so it's resting at our campsite right now. That's why it didn't come along to Port Ormos.
Souka: The other contestants' Fungi partners are accompanying Stormstress. If the opportunity comes along, I can take you to our campsite to meet them all!
Souka: Look, Lady Yae's Blitzara and Layla's Twirly-Whirly are just over there. They'd love to play with you.
Paimon: Nice! Let's go meet up with our shroom friends later, then!
Traveler: Good for you!
Traveler: Sorry, uh, who are you again...
Paimon: #Have you not been resting well these last few days, Traveler? Do you need a refresher or something?
Paimon: Souka's one of Yae Publishing House's new writers. She came with Miko to take part in the tournament previously!
Paimon: We did beat her in the second round, but uh... Ahem, let's not dwell on that too much...
Paimon: After that, Souka wrote us into her light novel. We're pretty important characters, so Paimon's really looking forward to reading it!
Traveler: Aha, yes, now I remember!
Paimon: Right? You're not that forgetful!
Paimon: So the contestant Haniyyah mentioned was you, huh? Why're you here in Sumeru by yourself?
Souka: Well, I was looking to regain the mindset I previously had during the tournament...
Souka: I'm about one-third of the way through writing my new book, but I feel like some of the parts I've written after that aren't quite right...

Paimon: Nice! Let's go meet up with our shroom friends later, then!
Traveler: Good for you!
Traveler: Yes, yes, that did happen...
Traveler: We'll talk again later!
Souka: Indeed, it seems you bear the expectations of many, and are most busy indeed...
Souka: I hope to see you both again soon!

## Talk

Paimon: Hey there, Twirly-Whirly! Hey there, Blitzara! Still remember us?
Paimon: Hahaha, no hesitation at all! They look so happy!
Paimon: Hmm, what should we do while we're hanging out?
Traveler: Let's use different sounds to communicate with them, shall we?
Paimon: Ooh, so you're gonna imitate animals? Sure! Paimon would like to know how Twirly-Whirly and Blitzara relate to other animals too!
Paimon: C'mon, let's give it a try!
Traveler: Cuckoo!
Twirly-Whirly: ?
Blitzara: ?
Paimon: Hmm, Sumeru doesn't really have pigeons, so our Fungi friends didn't really understand you at all.
Paimon: Maybe you can try imitating Dusk Birds instead?
Paimon: Chachacha, cha~chacha, chacha~ cha!
Paimon: Uh... Hmm, this is kinda difficult. Paimon can't match their rhythm at all. That might've just confused our shroom buddies more...
Traveler: Rawr!
Paimon: What? What were you trying to imitate? Wait. Was that you trying to sound like a Rishboland Tiger?
Paimon: You'll scare them!
Twirly-Whirly: ♪~
Blitzara: ♫~
Paimon: Wait, what? They seem pretty excited...
Paimon: Have they made friends with Rishboland Tigers and fought alongside them before?
Paimon: That's a bit difficult to imagine... Maybe we should observe Fungi out in the wild more carefully next time.
Traveler: Gang~ gang~ woo!
Paimon: Wait, why are you copying the Abyss Mages now? Well, you're not very convincing, sure, but you might still frighten them!
Twirly-Whirly: !
Blitzara: !
Paimon: Um, Twirly-Whirly and Blitzara both look kinda scared!
Paimon: #It's okay, it's okay, Traveler's just playing a prank on you two. There's no Abyss Mage nearby.
Paimon: Still, do Abyss Mages go around bullying Fungi, with hilichurls in tow and all?
Paimon: Grr, that makes Paimon kinda mad. If we encounter Fungi getting bullied out in the wild next time, there's no way we'd just stand by and let it happen!
Traveler: We'll come back later and play with them then.
Paimon: Yeah, there's still some stuff we need to do. Well, let's get it done quick, then come back and hang out with Twirly-Whirly and Blitzara, shall we?

Paimon: Hahaha, no hesitation at all! They look so happy!
Paimon: Hmm, what should we do while we're hanging out?
Traveler: Let's feed them, shall we?
Paimon: Alright, let's see what flavors they like!
Traveler: Use the Berry-flavored jellies.
Twirly-Whirly: ♩~
Blitzara: ♬~
Paimon: Hehe, looks like they both love the flavor of Berries!
Paimon: Berries are pretty easy to find — we snag loads just by walking around. Guess we can leave some for our shroom friends, eh?
Traveler: Use the Lavender Melon-flavored jellies.
Paimon: Wow, this flavor's really unexpected! Haniyyah's really good at this — Paimon didn't think she'd use ingredients from other nations in her Marvelous Jellies.
Twirly-Whirly: ...
Blitzara: ♬~
Paimon: Twirly-Whirly doesn't seem to understand the flavor of Lavender Melon. Maybe it's wondering whether they're fruits or vegetables.
Paimon: Well, Blitzara's having no problems, though. Maybe it's thinking about something happy.
Traveler: Use the Onion-flavored jellies.
Paimon: ?
Twirly-Whirly: ?
Blitzara: ?
Paimon: Is this flavor really a thing? Haniyyah's thought processes sure are interesting...
Twirly-Whirly: ...♩~
Paimon: Eh? Looks like Twirly-Whirly's come around... and it seems to like that!
Paimon: Is there anything special about onions? Let Paimon think...
Paimon: Hmm... Does it have invigorating effects?
Traveler: Let's use different sounds to communicate with them, shall we?
Paimon: Ooh, so you're gonna imitate animals? Sure! Paimon would like to know how Twirly-Whirly and Blitzara relate to other animals too!

## Talk

Balfour: Ah, my wondrous heroes! Would you be game for a few more rounds of Fungus Mechanicus?
Balfour: And should you have any questions, feel free to ask away!
Traveler: Play Fungus Mechanicus
Traveler: So, about future funding...
Paimon: That's right! If you hadn't mentioned it, Paimon would've totally forgotten! During the first tournament, we were attracted by the big...
Paimon: *cough* Err, we were attracted by the big tournament, which also had a sweet prize!
Paimon: So that means that we'll also have to prepare a tidy sum for the next tournament, won't we? That way, we can motivate people to aim for the top, which is where the best prizes will be!
Paimon: We'll also have to rent the venue, hire staff... And all this stuff's gonna cost Mora... Are we really gonna have to fork over all eight figures of it?
Balfour: Haha, and now you're speaking my language!
Balfour: Not to worry. I will be on the hunt for sponsors in the lead-up to the next tournament. We're talking about something along the lines of several dozen merchants helping to put up the funds for it to be held.
Balfour: As for remuneration, we'll just have to provide them with the equivalent amount of "exposure." After all, many merchants place great emphasis on the advertisement potential that popular competitive events have!
Traveler: I understand.
Paimon: That does sound pretty reasonable. If things go well, raising funds this way means that everyone wins!
Balfour: This field of work can be considered my specialty. Just give the okay, and I'll start sponsor-hunting.
Balfour: Of course, I'll investigate the status of all our sponsors very carefully before organizing it into a chart for your perusal.
Traveler: We will indeed have to be quite selective.
Balfour: Understood. Vigilance will be the watchword — especially after what happened the last time!
Paimon: We'll be counting on you then, Balfour!
Traveler: We'll definitely have to weed out any people with ill intent.
Traveler: That's definitely an idea.
Traveler: We can leave it for later.
Balfour: Alright! See you later, then, great heroes!

## Talk

Haniyyah: It's almost time to go, Souka. We'll rest for a while after eating, and then we'll pack the campsite up.
Haniyyah: We'll be heading out on a long trek shortly. If any of the Fungi can't walk any further, then we'll do it as we did before...
Haniyyah: You'll carry Twirly-Whirly and Blitzara, I'll carry Bongo-Head and Kindlejoy, and the tents and baggage will be left to the Sumpter Beast.
Souka: Alright. I'll get the fire started, then. And put some more food on, too — this is going to be a long trip, after all.
Paimon: Looks like Haniyyah and Souka have met up at the campsite. Paimon wonders what they're talking about...
Traveler: Well, why don't we listen in?
Paimon: Sure! Paimon's honestly quite curious... And surely they wouldn't mind, would they?
Souka: I heard that the Fungus Mechanicus trials went quite well.
Souka: Yesterday, a few merchants came up to me to confirm their invoices, and even they've played Fungus Mechanicus — they've got nothing but praise for it, too.
Haniyyah: Indeed, Balfour's really got a head for planning. We could learn a thing or two from him.
Haniyyah: We also had the help of Golden Comet and Silver Companion, and everything went quite smoothly overall. It's been really encouraging, honestly.
Souka: Ah, as one might expect of the "Twin Stars of Brilliant Valor"! Troubles that would stymie any ordinary person shall not frustrate them!
Souka: And issues that an ordinary person can handle shall all but quickly melt away...
Paimon: Hehe, they're praising us!
Traveler: Shh, Paimon...
Haniyyah: Come to think of it, have we ordered enough goods?
Souka: Don't worry. We're practically old customers of theirs by now.
Souka: Construction materials for expanding our camp, new bedding and a small meal table for our fungal friends, and a climbing frame for them to play... Everything has been accounted for.
Souka: The Marvelous Jelly ingredients that Master Najah left with the merchants are also as if fresh out of the oven!
Souka: You could say that we've really gained a lot from this trip to Port Ormos!
Haniyyah: Glad to hear it.
Haniyyah: After we get back to camp, I'd appreciate it if you could teach me some more words and grammar. I've got to finish my copy of "500 Things You Need to Know When Organizing a Big Event."
Souka: No problem. To be honest, the things we've gone over before are definitely sufficient. With how hard a worker you are, you'll finish that book with ease, I know it.
Souka: But are you sure you still want to learn more about doing business? You could always leave it to Mr. Balfour.
Haniyyah: The first iteration of the tournament had a lot of staff working in the background apart from Mr. Balfour, and we don't know how many more people we'll need to hire for the next.
Haniyyah: We can't just put the burden solely on his shoulders, and we shouldn't make our Golden Comet and Silver Companion worry about trivial matters either.
Haniyyah: That's why I need to learn how to wear many hats quickly. Apart from doing my job as a beast tamer well, I want to be able to handle all sorts of tournament-related affairs.
Haniyyah: And that's how I'll meet their expectations...
Souka: That makes sense... In which case, I'd like to help too!
Souka: I don't know what I can do, actually, but I'm determined to do something!
Haniyyah: In that case, I'd advise you to improve your physical abilities first. You'll have time for other things once you're able to survive by yourself in the wild. If not, I'll have to constantly keep an eye on you.
Souka: I'll... I'll do my best. I won't drag you down!
Souka: I mean, I've improved quite a bit during this time, haven't I? I even managed to beat back a large Shroomboar that had come charging into the camp!
Haniyyah: Hmm. Speaking of fighting, that reminds me. Would you fancy a change of attire?
Haniyyah: The hems of your current clothes are way too long for living in the forest, and they look pretty expensive as well. It would be a huge shame to ruin them...
Haniyyah: I have a few spare sets of Eremite attire, and even some weapons I used to use. If you don't mind, I could give them to you.
Souka: A mercenary's garb? I... I'm curious, that I must admit! This would be an amazing experience for me as a writer!
Paimon: Hehe, looks like they're getting along pretty nicely!
Traveler: If no one interrupts them...
Paimon: Alright, let's not disturb them, then. We should just let them continue discussing the future!
Traveler: I think they could probably go on forever...
Traveler: Hehe...
Traveler: Perhaps we should say hello all the same...
Paimon: Hmm, that works too. Sounds like they're going soon, so we can take this opportunity to chat just a bit.
Paimon: Hey there, Haniyyah, Souka!
Souka: Ahh! A sudden appearance, as befits our "Call-And-They-Appear Adventurers"!
Paimon: Huh. That nickname's also a first...
Paimon: How many nicknames do you have for us anyway, Souka? Maybe Paimon should get a little notebook someday and write them all down.
Haniyyah: Now, I did say that we would meet again soon, but I didn't expect to be proven right quite so quickly.
Haniyyah: Perhaps our next meeting will be just as unexpected as this one.
Haniyyah: If you choose to see your parting with your Fungi friends in that manner, the parting should sadden you less.
Traveler: That does make sense.
Paimon: Hehe, thanks Haniyyah! Paimon's feeling loads better already!
Haniyyah: We were just planning to return to camp once we finish eating. If you're not in a hurry, would you like to come with us?
Haniyyah: Souka's a very good cook, and she often makes things I've never even heard of — it'd be a shame for you to miss out.
Haniyyah: It was her suggestions that led Najah to make all kinds of new Marvelous Jelly flavors. Our shroom buddies really do enjoy them.
Paimon: R—Really?
Souka: Oh, it's nothing that dramatic. I was just trying to imitate some dishes I read about in the bridging plots of some light novels. There wasn't any special basis behind it...
Souka: Now that you two are here, I'm going to do more than my best to whip something awesome up!
Paimon: Woohoo, time for a feast!
Paimon: It's time for Souka's "Unbound Author's Feast"!
Haniyyah: I'll call our fungal friends over and lay a spread of their favorite Marvelous Jellies for them, so we can all eat together.
Haniyyah: Hmm... I... seem to have gotten used to this, haven't I?
Haniyyah: ...How nice.
Paimon: Did you just say something, Haniyyah?
Haniyyah: No, not really... Heh, just look at Souka go. It's almost like she's conjuring a meal, rather than cooking it.
Souka: Well, I'm starting — just watch me!
Black Screen Text: Souka picks out quite a few light novels with exceedingly long titles from her pile of books and checks them against the ingredients available at the campsite before deciding on the menu.
Black Screen Text: Afterward, she whips out some cooking utensils and begins the flashy and swift process of cooking. She quickly completes several luxuriant dishes.
Black Screen Text: Everyone sits on the campsite grounds, enjoying the delicious feast together with the Fungi.
Black Screen Text: The murmuring waters intertwine with the forest fragrances and the flavors of the feast...
Black Screen Text: Time seems to slow down, and the enjoyable time stretches on...
Paimon: Phew... That was great. Paimon's so full!
Paimon: What do you think, Bongo-Head, Kindlejoy, Twirly-Whirly, and Blitzara?
Bongo-Head: ♪~
Pyro-1: ♫~
Twirly-Whirly: ♩~
Blitzara: ♬~
Paimon: Hooray! Everyone else has eaten and drank their fill, too!
Traveler: Huh, I didn't understand that!
Paimon: Hehe, guess you'll have to have a few more conversations with Bongo-Head before the next tournament!
Paimon: Speaking of that, Paimon didn't think that you could cook Ajilenakh Nuts in that many ways...
Paimon: Or that cooked Sunsettias and Zaytun Peach would have this sort of flavor when mixed with spices.
Paimon: Huh, Souka hasn't been here long, but she seems like she already understands the unique points of the local ingredients!
Souka: Well, that's our job as authors. Before we write anything, we must do sufficient research into the places we will write about, and memorize the local encyclopedias as much as possible.
Souka: Sprinkle in a bit of the thought process that one reads about often in light novels — combining two strange elements to see what happens — and you might be pleasantly surprised by what you find.
Souka: Speaking of that, I just remembered a light novel opining that the pinnacle of culinary skill can transcend even the most absolute of preferences and the most ossified of habits...
Souka: For example, you can make people who don't enjoy spicy food eat some, or cause dogs to fall in love with cat food...
Souka: The author reasoned that "there are no borders within food so long as you grasp and control the key ingredient that lies between love and hate"!
Souka: Perhaps that principle may also work with our shroom buddies?
Souka: Perhaps they may no longer be limited to using Marvelous Jellies for sustenance should our culinary skills reach a certain threshold.
Paimon: Is that so? That... sounds... kinda reasonable?
Paimon: #Traveler, maybe we should keep an eye out the next time we go to Inazuma to see if we can find that kind of light novel!
Paimon: If a suitable opportunity arises, we should start our own special culinary training. Let's show our shroom buddies a whole new world of gourmet dining!
Traveler: Leave it to me, Paimon!
Souka: Nice, nice. I guess I can add "Hyperadaptive Chef" to your list of features... and perhaps you really will succeed!
Haniyyah: If it's you two, I suspect that you'll even be able to accomplish things that cannot be explained through common sense — you'll show everyone that it's done.
Haniyyah: I look forward to it, in fact. Let's all do our best!
Paimon: Alrighty then! Now that we're all fired up, let's get a move on!
Paimon: Let's share another meal just like this one the next time we meet!
Traveler: We'll give it a try, no matter how hard things get!
Traveler: Can Paimon speak to the Fungi?
Traveler: Let's leave them to do what they have to.
Paimon: Hmm, that's true. Everyone has their own arrangements, so let's not disrupt their rhythm.
Paimon: Let's hope we meet them again soon!

## Talk

Paimon: Bongo-Head, Kindlejoy, Twirly-Whirly, Blitzara! You're all here!
Traveler: The gang's all here, indeed.
Paimon: Make sure you listen to Haniyyah, alright? Eat on time, sleep well, train hard, and live happy lives!
Bongo-Head: ♪~
Pyro-1: ♫~
Twirly-Whirly: ♩~
Blitzara: ♬~
Paimon: Hehehe, that's good, that's good. We'll have loads of presents for you all the next time we meet!
Traveler: Behold Paimon, grandmaster of the fungal tongue!
Paimon: Hehe, to be honest, Paimon doesn't know what they're saying either, but they sure do look happy, and they listen to Paimon!
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon already knows what we should bring them then...
Paimon: We'll get Bongo-Head a real round hat. It'll look nice and it'll also protect its soft head.
Paimon: It can wear that hat, and when it doesn't, Paimon will take care of it.
Paimon: That way, Bongo-Head will never go bongo-less, and it'll be cooler than ever!
Bongo-Head: ♪~
Traveler: Bongo-Head's a Hydro Fungus...
Paimon: Uh, um... Guess we can just get it a waterproof hat! Y'know, maybe we'll get one that's made of Nilotpala Lotus or something like that. That way, the water droplets will just slide off it!
Paimon: It'll be a bit more expensive, but eh, it's fine — you can just take it out of Paimon's allowance!
Paimon: Twirly-Whirly's next up. We should get it a satchel for it to store Marvelous Jellies. That way, it can just grab some whenever it's hungry.
Paimon: Twirly-Whirly is all floaty-boaty, it can use Anemo, and it's really strong, too — carrying stuff for the other Fungi should be no problem!
Paimon: It can drag its own luggage along, after all.
Traveler: Twirly-Whirly's pretty strong.
Twirly-Whirly: ♩~
Paimon: Hehe! Looks like Twirly-Whirly loves the idea!
Paimon: Kindlejoy's up next. We need to pick a snug eyemask for it that won't fall off no matter how it swings around...
Paimon: Right, we should also find an opportunity to have Haniyyah take its measurements.
Traveler: And what for again?
Paimon: C'mon, Kindlejoy's a Pyro Fungus. Just think about it. Pyro Fungi are like, super shiny!
Paimon: Don't you think that the light that Kindlejoy might wind up waking itself up with its own light from time to time? That sounds like it'd be really uncomfortable!
Traveler: Well, do you see Kindlejoy having eye bags?
Paimon: Maybe we should just ask the shroom in question!
Paimon: Kindlejoy, do you normally sleep well?
Pyro-1: ♫~
Paimon: It seems to be saying... "very well indeed"... So it doesn't have this particular problem, huh.
Paimon: Let's give this a little more thought. Paimon's sure that we can come up with something that Kindlejoy will love!
Paimon: Next, let's talk about Blitzara's gift. Paimon thinks it should be a drawing board that you can leave traces on using Electro.
Paimon: Blitzara's a very active and agile sort, so it should really enjoy drawing!
Paimon: And it can also get some exercise at the same time — two birds with one stone!
Blitzara: ♬~
Traveler: It would need to give you the option of scrubbing the board clean.
Paimon: That's true! Let's give that function a bit of thought before placing an order with a craftsperson, shall we?
Paimon: We also need to think about who would be able to fulfill such a commission...
Traveler: Hmm, but you know, you've already revealed the contents of the gifts...
Paimon: Hehe, it's fine! Paimon said that we'd come up with "loads" of presents, so there'll be more to come!
Paimon: We can take our time to consider and take our pick. We're not strictly by numbers, after all.
Paimon: Our goal is to make sure that our shroom buddies will have loads of fun with the gifts!
Traveler: A pile of gifts it shall be.
Paimon: Alright, guess we should set off too. Let's take as many commissions as we can, so that we can save the Mora we'll need to buy these presents.
Paimon: Alright then, Bongo-Head, Kindlejoy, Twirly-Whirly, Blitzara. We'll see you all soon, so be patient, alright?
Traveler: It'll be tons of fun indeed!
Traveler: Haven't you already ruined the surprise at this point, though?
Traveler: We'd have to prevent the drawing board from turning into an utter mess.
Traveler: Hmm... Y'know, when you put it like that, it does seem that Haniyyah might be the one who needs an eyemask.
Traveler: Wait, I don't get the point of this gift.
Traveler: Don't you mean it'll be wetter than ever?
Traveler: Teach me your ways, great master!
Traveler: We'll come back and play with them later.
Paimon: Hmm, it seems like Haniyyah and Souka are getting ready to leave soon. Let's be quick and make sure we come back in time and get to see everyone!
