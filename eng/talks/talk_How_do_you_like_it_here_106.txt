Traveler: How do you like it here?
Kachina: It's... It's all really nice! Don't worry about me. I can take care of myself.
Traveler: Sure you're not just putting on a brave face?
Kachina: Huh? No... of course not!
Kachina: What gave you that impression though? Was it my ears? My... facial expression? Or my body language?
Traveler: All of the above, really.
Kachina: I'm sorry! It's just... It's a completely new environment, and my body's taking some time to adapt.
Kachina: Thanks for your concern, but... I'll be fine. Really, I will.
Kachina: Oh — the weather here's really great, and there's such a peaceful atmosphere. I love it!
Kachina: I want to adjust as quickly as possible, and I also don't want you to worry about me, so...
Kachina: ...Could I stay here for a little longer? I won't cause a fuss! You won't even know I'm here!
Traveler: You can relax a little more, you know.
Kachina: ...You're right. Thank you for inviting me here. I'll... I'll try my hardest to relax!
Traveler: If you're "trying," you're probably doing it wrong... Just... relax.
Kachina: O—Oh, yeah. Good point...
Kachina: It's just... Your place is so nice, and your invitation made me so happy, I'm not sure what to do...
Kachina: M—Maybe I just need a little more time to adjust.
Kachina: I... don't travel often, and here, I'm surrounded by things I've never seen before! I almost forget to breathe just trying to take it all in...
Traveler: It's alright! You can do whatever you want here.
Kachina: Ohh, thank you! *sniff* You're so nice...
