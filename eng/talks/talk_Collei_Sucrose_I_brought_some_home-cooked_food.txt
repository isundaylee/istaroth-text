# Talk Dialog

Amber: Collei! Sucrose! I brought some home-cooked food, why don't we enjoy it together?
Collei: Really? Sounds great!
Sucrose: Iâ€”I must point out a small issue about your cooking! You have a tendency to put a little too much flavoring in your dishes...
Amber: Ahahaha, sorry! I guess I've been a little heavy-handed with the seasonings lately...
Collei: Are you feeling stressed recently? Do you want to find someone to play cards with? It really helps with stress, I promise!
Eula: Oh, that sounds like a good idea. If I recall, both you and Sucrose are pretty good players, right?
Sucrose: Oh yeah, we are! We've been playing together, and we were actually talking about this just a few days ago...
Eula: Since you are already familiar... would you mind also showing me the rules sometime?
Amber: Yeah, Collei seems to be a natural at the game... Maybe she's already the best player out of all of us!
Collei: Huh!? Me!?
Eula: That's right, you've been all the talk at the tavern. "That little girl from Sumeru is really good at the game... If I can find the chance, I would love to test my skills against her."
Collei: Really!?
Sucrose: Isn't that great, Collei? You've become a TCG celebrity!
Collei: Oh, I... I... Ehehe...
