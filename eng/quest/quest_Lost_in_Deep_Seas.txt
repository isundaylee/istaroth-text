# Lost in Deep Seas


## Talk 1

Paimon: Okay, so we've investigated two of the "hidden rules." Paimon didn't think this prison would have... so many weird things going on.
Paimon: We'd better pick up the pace with our investigation. Otherwise, we'll never get anywhere.
Traveler: Let's spend some coupons to skip our shifts so we can go investigate.
Paimon: Yeah, let's skip work for now and put our time to good use!

## Talk 2

Leonide: ...What are you talking about? Listen, you should keep your nose out of other people's business.

## Talk 3

Vidoc: Oho, seeing you at this time must mean you've already saved up a lot of Credit Coupons. Or at least enough to skip work... Heh, seems you're getting into the swing of things around here.
Traveler: We're getting by.
Vidoc: Impressive... Very impressive...
Paimon: So, now can you tell us about the hidden rules you know?
Vidoc: Ah, if that's what you what to know, I guess you couldn't have come at a better time.
Paimon: Huh, what do you mean it's a good time?
Vidoc: Leonide and those other pesky broke urchins have all gone to work in the production zone. I wouldn't want them listening in without paying up.
Paimon: We get it, just tell us already!
Vidoc: So, you know those pipes that make strange sounds? Don't ever, ever go near them at night. Even if you manage to avoid the guards, you might find something even more terrible there...
Paimon: Something even more terrible? Like what?
Vidoc: A group of cannibals.
Paimon: Cannibals!? In the Fortress of Meropide!?
Vidoc: Every month, they meet a few times in the dead of night. Rumor has it that they might be connected to the people that've disappeared here.
Vidoc: But what's even scarier is that they have a "special" proclivity...
Vidoc: Since they have no way to dispose of the leftover remains, they have ways to transform them into other forms and keep them in the Fortress forever.
Paimon: Uh, Paimon might already know what you mean by "other forms"... So that's what's going on here. Ugh, Paimon's stomach doesn't feel so good...
Traveler: Is that really true?
Vidoc: Hehe, you two look pretty skeptical. No matter, learning the truth behind dark secrets isn't necessarily a good thing.
Vidoc: I've got things to do too. I suggest you just act like I never told you anything.
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, can we just trust him on this one? Oh, Paimon doesn't want her blood and flesh entombed here for all eternity...
Traveler: Even if it's true...
Paimon: Oh... So that's how you see the situation... Huh. Y'know, Paimon does feel a little better about it now.
Traveler: Alright, then just like before...
Paimon: *sigh* When will all the secrets end?
Black Screen Text: Brimming with curiosity, you and Paimon eat lunch and head out to investigate this new "hidden rule"...
Traveler: Let's get ready to investigate another hidden rule.
Traveler: Do you really think cannibals could take me in a fight?
Traveler: There's still a chance that what we saw isn't connected to cannibals.
Traveler: My goal is to become the next Duke!

## Talk 4

Alexis: What!? What are you saying!? You shouldn't go around saying stuff like that.

## Talk 5

Poirier: ...
Poirier: Just stay away from me.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Okay, so we've investigated two of the "hidden rules." Paimon didn't think this prison would have... so many weird things going on.
Paimon: We'd better pick up the pace with our investigation. Otherwise, we'll never get anywhere.
Traveler: But I don't have enough Credit Coupons.
Paimon: Huh? We already used up all our coupons?
Paimon: Ugh, fine... Paimon secretly stashed some coupons away to buy some souvenirs and stuff, but it sounds like we really need them now.
Traveler: Where did you get coupons?
Paimon: Hey, Paimon's been working too, you know! Paimon just doesn't earn much, that's all...
Paimon: Anyway, let's use these coupons to get out of work so we have time to investigate!

## Talk 7

Paimon: Their attitude sure is suspicious, like they're trying to avoid us...
Traveler: It's pretty obvious that they're hiding something...
Paimon: But if they're being so obvious about acting weirdly, do you think they might just be trying to lure us in?
Paimon: This is all getting way too creepy for Paimon...
Traveler: Let's approach it from a different angle.
Paimon: So you mean we still need to investigate some more? Okay... If you say so...
Traveler: We'll probably never get anything out of these guys.
Traveler: Could they be connected to the cannibals?

## Talk 8

Paimon: Hello, Fielding.
Fielding: Whaddaya want? Criminals like you oughta be working right now, catch my drift?
Paimon: We just want to ask you a simple question...
Paimon: Have you ever discovered anything odd during your nighttime patrols?
Fielding: Why're you asking about something like that? Whatever happens at night isn't your concern. All you need to worry about is getting enough sleep.
Paimon: Uh... Well...
Traveler: You see, sometimes...
Paimon: Râ€”Right, we've heard it happens a few times every month. Paimon has sensitive ears, so it makes it hard to sleep!
Fielding: Really? I see... but it's not like I'm on duty every night.
Fielding: Now that you mention it, I recall my colleagues talking about something like that before. They say that strange things tend to happen at night on pipe-cleaning days. Lots of us don't willingly take those shifts.
Paimon: So what happens at night on pipe-cleaning days?
Fielding: They just conduct regular cleaning of the Fortress' drainage facilities.
Fielding: There are three pipe-cleaning days per month... And it just so happens that today is one of the scheduled days. You can try to confirm the sounds tonight if you want, and if they're real, then I can report the issue to my superiors for you.
Paimon: Oh, okay. Then we'll keep both ears out tonight!
Fielding: If that's all, then I'll be leaving now. I'd advise you not to try anything funny, though. Even if I'm not on duty tonight, someone will still be watching you.
Paimon: Don't worry, we don't want any time added to our sentences!
Paimon: He left... So, what do you think about the pipe-cleaning days he mentioned?
Traveler: Those might be the days when the cannibals are active.
Paimon: Right, both are a possibility. But Fielding did say that tonight is a cleaning night...
Traveler: No reason not to find out the truth for ourselves.
Paimon: Paimon knew you would say that. Alright, sounds like we'll be up all night tonight then... Paimon just hopes the guards don't catch us.
Traveler: But it might also be nothing, just the pipes being cleaned.
Traveler: We hear strange noises at night.

## Talk 9

Paimon: *yawn* Paimon's so tired... But we can't sleep yet. They'll be cleaning the pipes tonight, so it's the perfect chance for us to investigate...
Traveler: We just need to wait until everyone else has fallen asleep...
Paimon: Whatever, just be sure to wake Paimon if she dozes off... Paimon's worried something might happen if you go alone...
Paimon: #Huh? {NICKNAME}? Did you fall asleep already!?
Black Screen Text: "Something is calling me, I have to go."
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}! C'mon, wake up!
Traveler: I...
Paimon: Oh! It looked like you were just peacefully sleeping to Paimon... Well, what did you see this time?
Traveler: Investigating the pipes tonight is the right call.
Paimon: Really? So we're finally starting to figure out what actually happened... But what about the cannibals? How do you explain them?
Traveler: I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Paimon: Okay... Well, it's about time for us to get moving. Just be careful to avoid the patrolling guards.
Traveler: Childe escaped via the pipes.
Traveler: I saw Childe in my dream again.
Traveler: If we miss our chance tonight, it'll be a while before we get another opportunity.

## Talk 10

Paimon: Uh oh! They spotted us!

## Talk 11

Paimon: Okay... Well, it's about time for us to get moving. Just be careful to avoid the patrolling guards.

## Talk 12

Fielding: Using coupons to skip work doesn't bring freedom, but only pulls you closer to the abyss of degeneracy... That's what an old guard here used to say, you'd do well to remember it.

## Talk 13

Poirier: The way up from here has been sealed off. It's impossible to get through.
Poirier: Boss left by going down from here. It wasn't full of water at the time...
Poirier: Later, we came back hoping to have a look. That's when we found out it had been completely flooded.
Poirier: It's impossible to navigate unless you're an extremely skilled diver.
Paimon: Do you think Childe got trapped by the water?
Leonide: Not likely, we all know that boss was an incredible swimmer.
Traveler: I know a good diver.
Alexis: Really? Then have him come investigate, pronto! Just be sure to tell us if you get any news about Boss.
Poirier: It's getting late. We should leave before the guards come this way.
Paimon: Yeah, we learned a lot about what happened to Childe here. Let's get going.

## Talk 14

Leonide: I know you... You were the ones we saw...
Alexis: Hmph, you've got guts showing up here. You know who we are, right?
Poirier: You'd better leave now, ain't nobody coming here to save you!
Traveler: Enough with the theatrics...
Alexis: What you say!?
Traveler: All those rumors about cannibals and hidden rules...
Alexis: Yeah, so what if they were? If you push us, we can make those rumors a reality at any time!
Paimon: Hey! What's the point of all those rumors anyway? What exactly are you trying to do?
Leonide: I don't have to tell you anything. If you turn around, go back to the dormitories, and act like you never saw anything, then I'll pretend that you never showed up here!
Poirier: Yeah, scram. Nothing worth seeing here...
Traveler: "There's something calling me..."
Poirier: Huh...? What did you say?
Alexis: Isn't that exactly what boss said when he left?
Leonide: Hey, do you know our boss?
Traveler: Yeah, "Childe" Tartaglia?
Leonide: Whoa, we had no idea our boss was such a big deal... he always kept his identity a secret.
Leonide: So, did he have you come here to find us?
Paimon: Oh, so you're Childe's crew here? Seems like he had no problem fitting in...
Traveler: I'm a friend of his.
Alexis: We're the only ones who heard him say those words when he left that night... So unless he somehow told you those exact same words after that...
Alexis: Hmm... Alright, I guess that's proof enough for me. I believe you.
Paimon: Wow, those dreams of yours sure come in handy.
Leonide: We gave him the business for a while and would always give him a hard time when he first came to the Fortress of Meropide.
Leonide: But here in the Fortress, the strong will always earn respect.
Leonide: He was working the longest hours and racking up wins in the Pankration Ring...
Leonide: You could always see how amazing he was, even when he was teaching us a lesson...
Leonide: So eventually, we all decided to follow him.
Alexis: But one day, he suddenly told us that he had to find a way to escape this place, no matter the cost. He said it was because he heard that call again...
Alexis: And as his crew, if the boss wants something, then it's our job to get it done.
Alexis: So... We got to work and used the "hidden rules" that were here to make up and spread the rumor about the "cannibal rule"...
Alexis: We just wanted to give him a better chance of escaping on a night after the pipes had been cleaned.
Paimon: Oh... Thanks to your rumor, nobody would want to come anywhere near here, prisoner or guard! Wow, it sure is easy to exploit people's fear of the unknown.
Paimon: But hasn't Childe already escaped? Why are you all still coming here after pipe-cleaning day?
Poirier: Because as far as we know, the pipe he went into isn't actually an exit... It should be a dead end.
Poirier: It leads to an abandoned factory area, and even if there were a way to escape from there into the sea, we're still way too deep. No-one could ever reach the surface alive.
Poirier: But Boss still insisted on going in, it was like he was obsessed about it.
Poirier: So we told him that we'd pretend as if he never existed while he was gone.
Poirier: And that if he wanted to come back, he should wait for nighttime on a pipe-cleaning day. That way, we could meet him here and help cover the whole thing up.
Paimon: So you come and wait here through the night a few times a month just because of that promise?
Leonide: Yeah, but it's been so long now, we already know in our hearts that he must have managed to escape somehow.
Paimon: Uh, is it also possible that something... unfortunate happened to him?
Alexis: Nothing could ever defeat Boss or slow him down. That's one thing we know for sure!
Paimon: Okay, okay... Paimon was just brainstorming possibilities...
Traveler: Can you take us there...?
Leonide: Alright, keep quiet and follow us.
Traveler: We want to go to the spot where he left.
Traveler: We came here to learn what happened to him.
Traveler: One of Snezhnaya's Fatui Harbingers.
Traveler: "I have to go."
Traveler: Were started by you, weren't they?

## Talk 15

Paimon: Whew... We finally learned some key information. Seems all of our investigative work has finally started to pay off!
Paimon: When you said you knew a diver, you were talking about Freminet, right? If we ask Lyney, he'll definitely have Freminet help us.
Paimon: Argh! Why is Childe like this... What was he doing going into the pipes? Not making our jobs easier, that's for sure.
Paimon: Fortunately, though, it seems like it's only a matter of time now before we find out what really happened.
Paimon: #Now that we can finally relax, Paimon's starting to feel super sleepy. Let's try to get some rest while we still can. Nighty-night, {NICKNAME}.
