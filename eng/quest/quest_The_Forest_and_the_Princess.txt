# The Forest and the Princess


## Talk 1

Saborn: Your Highness! What brings you here?
Cimest: ...Given how things stand, I shall retrieve the *relic* myself, and then decide what to do next.
Saborn: Your Highness! That will not do!
Souffache: Your Highness! You cannot go!
Cimest: Oh? It seems you have a better solution. Let's hear it then, Minister Saborn.
Saborn: I... Uh... Would like to inform Your Highness that, following a long discussion with Souffache last night, we have come to the conclusion that... It would be better to set up a trial ground elsewhere...
Souffache: Hear, hear! And then the Guardian who passes our selection process can retrieve the relic for us — two birds, one stone!
Cimest: But without the relic, how can we be sure that the chosen Guardian is really the one we are looking for?
Saborn: I... Uh...
Cimest: Worry not, ministers. Though we are indeed facing a great crisis, this is precisely as the legends predicted.
Cimest: When the crisis befalls us, a Guardian shall thereupon emerge. At this moment, what I must do is ensure that they are shown the right path.
Cimest: Besides, I am the best flyer in the kingdom, so there is none more suitable than I to judge the Guardian's abilities.
Souffache: But...
Cimest: Then will you go instead?
Souffache: I—I'm afraid... My legs are rather useless when it comes to flight of any kind...
Cimest: How about you, Saborn? Will you go?
Saborn: Uhh, m—my eyesight... Alas, I fear I would be unable to see their movements clearly enough to judge...
Cimest: Good, that's settled then. The two of you will stay to handle affairs within the kingdom, while I shall assist in managing the selection process at the original location myself.
Traveler: Something fun going on?
Cimest: Oh, greetings to both of you, and welcome to the Kingdom of Breezes and Bells. You're very welcome to sign up for the "Guardian of the Kingdom" selection trials.
Cimest: You have not previously participated in the selection trials of our Kingdom of Breezes and Bells, if I am not mistaken?
Paimon: How does Your Highness know this?
Cimest: Your appearance differs greatly from our kingdom's subjects. Had you taken part before, I would not forget it.
Cimest: Oh! That's enough chit-chat, I suppose. As it so happens, I was just about to head over to host the selection ceremony near the Relic Shrine. Let us go there together.
Cimest: Ministers, the kingdom's affairs are in your hands. Do try not to let anyone cut this tree down while I'm away finding our true Guardian, if you could?
Saborn: *sigh* As you wish, Your Highness.
Cimest: The two of you, please come with me. Before the selection officially begins, there are a few things I still need to tell you.
Traveler: Might I submit myself as a candidate for the trial, Your Highness?
Paimon: Ooh, ooh! We're good at flying, and adventuring too! Can we participate?

## Talk 2

Cimest: Please wait here a moment. I will introduce the trial for you, as well as a few things that you'll need to watch out for.
Paimon: Wow... Her Highness sure is a decisive decision-maker, huh? Guess that's a true princess for you...
Traveler: I declared I'd accept the trial quite suddenly...
Cimest: Hmm? Oh... Perhaps my introduction seemed a little too forthcoming. My apologies.
Cimest: In truth, there have been many squirrels who — like you — have suddenly turned up and declared their intention to undergo the trial, so I am already accustomed to receiving such "candidates."
Cimest: At least... There were many, before that dragon attacked the kingdom.
Traveler: You said it was to retrieve a relic...
Cimest: It is indeed. As I mentioned, not long ago, a giant dragon passed through our kingdom.
Cimest: We tried our best to drive it away, but before leaving, it trampled both the trial ground and the sacred site where the relic was kept to smithereens.
Cimest: Our original, stable trial environment is now very different from the way it used to be. The wind currents have become unpredictable, causing a dramatic increase in the difficulty of some trial stages.
Cimest: After the environment changed so drastically, some candidates — who could have easily passed the first few stages before — now find even the very first stage too challenging.
Cimest: But from another perspective, the current trial is actually a better test of a candidate's true strength, so it should better help us choose a strong "Guardian of the Kingdom."
Traveler: I—I'm pretty strong!
Paimon: P—Paimon too!
Cimest: Hmm... Well if that is truly the case, let us get straight to it. Allow me to introduce the trial for you.
Cimest: Simply put, in this trial, the candidate must help their squirrel companion fly in the right direction by guiding them along the wind currents.
Cimest: Don't worry, it isn't complicated. All you have to do is observe the direction of the currents and make decisions accordingly.
Cimest: Of course, you need not worry about the issue of direction. In this kingdom, no wind can stop me from flying wherever I will.
Cimest: Alright, let us begin. Please make sure you're both ready.
Traveler: Is it being kept somewhere dangerous?
Traveler: But Your Highness didn't seem particularly surprised...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Your Highness, you're amazing! You flew past so easily!
Cimest: Your ability to judge the wind's currents was also remarkable. It seems you are worthy to undergo the trial after all.
Cimest: Let us make haste to the site where the relic is being kept... Hopefully we won't have another run-in with that dragon.
Cimest: "...I am a voice, but not life..."
Paimon: #Huh, what was that? It sounded like... someone's voice? Traveler, did you hear that?
Traveler: I definitely heard it...
Paimon: Whoa, The Princess is way ahead... Let's forget about that for now and catch up with her first.
Traveler: ...But I have no idea what it meant.

## Talk 4

Souffache: *sigh* When will I be able to find a Guardian...
Saborn: If we cannot find one, then at the very least we must allow Her Highness to...
Saborn: ...I've heard that in Brickstacks, they have a way to go outside the world, otherwise...
Souffache: Saborn, that's quite enough. As for the exact method, we can discuss the details later...

## Talk 5

Cimest: ...I didn't expect you to be able to judge the wind currents so accurately.
Cimest: If you were flying squirrels like I am, navigating those wind currents would pose you no challenge, of that I am certain...
Traveler: Paimon's a natural when it comes to flying.
Cimest: Pfff... Is that so? I'm glad to hear that, because you two are the most Guardian-like candidates I've ever seen.
Cimest: Then let us continue. The current wind conditions are just right.
Traveler: No problem!
Paimon: Hehe, everything's going great! Maybe we're the Guardians that Her Highness has been looking for.
Traveler: Your Highness was outstanding, too.
Cimest: Thank you for your kind words. I had in fact passed the trial many times before the dragon destroyed the sacred site.
Cimest: Purely in terms of flying ability, I am confident that no other squirrel is my equal. Previous candidates found even the first few stages too difficult.
Paimon: Huh? But if Your Highness already passed the trial, how come you didn't take the relic?
Cimest: ...Unfortunately, the relic has yet to acknowledge me.
Traveler: So even Guardians require the relic's acknowledgment?
Cimest: That I do not know. Perhaps it thought I didn't pass the trial...
Traveler: Surely there aren't hidden stages?
Cimest: All I know is, the relic has never lit up for me.
Cimest: But you... Not only have you come precisely at our kingdom's hour of need, but your capabilities are undeniable. That is why I believe you will earn the relic's acknowledgement.
Cimest: Let us continue. The final stage of the trial awaits.
Traveler: Do the trial stages change for each challenger?
Traveler: Why does that relic get to call all the shots...
Traveler: Your Highness is the only true Guardian.
Traveler: If everyone had to use wind gliders, I'd be unbeatable.

## Talk 6

Paimon: So... This is where the relic was being kept?
Traveler: These footprints are massive.
Cimest: Perhaps in driving the dragon away, we also drove it into a rage.
Cimest: The relic is down there. Pass the trial, and you may claim it.
Paimon: Paimon thought that the relic would be protected by some kind of seal, or guard, or... something.
Paimon: But it looks like it's just lying there, and it doesn't seem like anything's stopping someone from just taking it...
Traveler: Just a hop and a step away.
Cimest: What you say is correct. This relic does indeed have a "seal" — namely, the "trial" that you have seen.
Cimest: According to the kingdom's records, one must pass the trial in order to retrieve the relic.
Cimest: Conversely, if it is taken by someone who has not yet passed the trial, it will lose its "meaning" as a relic.
Cimest: ...Thus, even I must pass the entire trial to retrieve the "true" relic.
Cimest: There must be both a "trial" and a "challenger" to do so.
Cimest: Without satisfying these two conditions, the best-case scenario is that we'd be walking away with a useless lump of stone.
Paimon: "The best-case scenario"... Does that mean something worse could happen, too?
Traveler: Those who act in defiance of the rules shall be cursed.
Paimon: C—Cursed! Uhh, in that case, let's just... go ahead and accept the trial...
Traveler: Why don't we just jump down and take it?
Traveler: That dragon must be huge...

## Talk 7

Paimon: #We passed! Traveler, we're Guardians now! So is this the relic that's used to acknowledge new Guardians?
Paimon: Huh? There's something carved onto it, like a line of text maybe? Let Paimon take a closer look...
Paimon: "Stories follow rules, unfolding in cyclical patterns, but each should follow its own course."
Paimon: #Uhh, Paimon doesn't get it. Do you get it, Traveler?
Traveler: It's probably some roundabout way of cheering us on?
Cimest: Those words have always been there. Even I do not know their origin...
Cimest: I sense that they may hold some great significance for the kingdom... But I have yet to grasp their meaning.
Cimest: Whatever the case, given your performance in the trial, you are undoubtedly the most suitable candidate for the title of "Guardian" that I've ever met.
Cimest: Your abilities and judgment are beyond question. Meeting you at a time like this is truly a blessing for our kingdom.
Cimest: Now that we have retrieved the relic, we may hold the ceremony right away.
Cimest: I am fully confident that your courage and abilities will have won you the relic's respect.
Traveler: You flatter me, Your Highness.
Paimon: Hehe, it was nothing! We're just glad we could help you, Your Highness.
Paimon: Whoa! When did you guys get here? Paimon didn't even notice you arrive!
Souffache: We flew over, of course! We were among the best flyers around when we were young, you know. How else would we have been able to serve the princess?
Traveler: Never judge a squirrel by its appearance...
Souffache: Well, I never! A visitor turning up at our time of crisis, a Guardian emerging from the trials victorious... and the relic in our possession, intact and unharmed!
Souffache: Your Highness, everything is exactly as the legends said!
Saborn: It seems that our kingdom finally has a "future" to look forward to!
Cimest: We shall find out soon enough.
Cimest: Now, please place your hand upon the relic. Let it light up and proclaim that you are henceforth the "Guardian of the Kingdom"!
Traveler: ...Erm, do... do you think it's not bright enough?
Paimon: Let Paimon take a look... Ehh? M—Maybe it's been there so long that... it just can't light up anymore?
Paimon: Kinda like how candles that've been lying around too long won't burn very brightly.
Saborn: How... How could that be? All the details match, yet the relic still...
Souffache: Your Highness, whatever the case, at least the relic is in our hands. Even if our guest has failed to be acknowledged by...
Cimest: ...No.
Souffache: Your Highness?
Cimest: Set the relic aside. It is my kingdom for which the challengers have come; therefore it is I who must acknowledge them.
Saborn: Your Highness! B—But no ruler of our kingdom has ever taken it upon themselves to acknowledge a "Guardian"...
Cimest: Then let us create a precedent for future rulers to follow.
Cimest: #Traveler, Paimon, come forward.
Cimest: As Princess of the Kingdom of Breezes and Bells, I hereby declare...
Cimest: #That Traveler and Paimon shall henceforth be recognized as the kingdom's "Paladins of Breezes and Bells"!
Traveler: At your service, Your Highness.
Paimon: Hooray! A "Paladin of Breezes and Bells"... Hehe, such a cool title!
Traveler: Definitely cooler than just being any old guardian.
Saborn: B—But surely that means we still haven't found our "Guardian"? And if that is so, then we won't be able to fulfill our "calling."
Souffache: And if we cannot fulfill our "calling"... We'll no longer have a "future" to look forward to, just like the kingdoms that came before us...
Cimest: ...Fret not, I will find a way.
Traveler: You have my sword.
Cimest: My thanks, good Paladin. I will indeed need your help.
Cimest: But first, I will need to put the pieces of this puzzle together...
Cimest: After some time has passed, please return to my kingdom to meet me. When the time is nigh, we shall set forth in search of the kingdom's future together.
Traveler: Shouldst thou require my aid, I am at thy service.
Traveler: It is my honor, Your Highness.
Traveler: Has... it even lit up at all?
Traveler: Nothing can stand in our way!
Traveler: It's probably meant to encourage challengers.

## Talk 8

Souffache: And if we cannot fulfill our "calling"... We'll no longer have a "future" to look forward to, just like the kingdoms that came before us...
Cimest: ...Fret not, I will find a way.
Traveler: Wait, speaking of choosing a Guardian...
Paimon: You mean that Faurobert who could jump super high?
Paimon: You're right! The whole reason they held that contest was to find a champion to come rescue the princess...
Paimon: Although it doesn't seem like the princess needs saving. If you were looking for a super-strong champion to win your contest, they just so happen to have one!
Paimon: In fact, there's bound to be heaps of potential champions over there!
Traveler: Wait... By "contest," you mean "trial."
Cimest: What an extraordinary coincidence...
Cimest: Though our trial doesn't really have anything to do with jumping. Still, from what you've said, it sounds like they've found the strongest candidate to complete their calling.
Cimest: ...It seems a trip over to Rainsong Pond is in order. Thank you for informing me.
Saborn: Wait! But Your Highness, they're all paper frogs over there! They're nothing like us, they're not...
Cimest: So what? A Guardian's most vital asset is what is in their heart, not their appearance.
Cimest: Ministers, you are to stay and look after the kingdom while I am gone. I will go to Rainsong Pond myself.
Cimest: My loyal Paladin, I hope that the "Champion" over at Rainsong Pond is as fearless and skilled as you are.
Paimon: Well... Skilled is certainly accurate...
Traveler: But as for fearless...
Cimest: Oh? You mean to say that this "Champion" of theirs is actually... a sheep in wolf's clothing?
Cimest: Hahaha! Then all the more reason to go meet him in person!
Cimest: Alright, that's settled then. Oh, and if I'm going over to Rainsong Pond... Perhaps I'd better bring some gifts...
Traveler: ...That remains to be seen.
Traveler: And by "champion," you mean "Guardian."
Traveler: They're currently choosing a champion over at Rainsong Pond...
Traveler: It is my honor, Your Highness.
Traveler: Has... it even lit up at all?
Traveler: Nothing can stand in our way!
Traveler: It's probably meant to encourage challengers.

## Talk 9

Paimon: So... This is where the relic was being kept?
Traveler: These footprints are massive.
Cimest: Perhaps in driving the dragon away, we also drove it into a rage.
Traveler: That dragon is actually...
Black Screen Text: You tell the story of the dragon to Princess Cimest in its entirety, sparing no detail...
Cimest: ...Can such a thing be? Truly unexpected.
Cimest: At the time, I was too panicked, and so I just gave the order to drive him away.
Cimest: Had we the chance to calmly speak with one another, perhaps...
Cimest: Ahem! Never mind. What's done is done. We must focus on the problem at hand.
Cimest: As for that dragon... once all our problems have been resolved, I shall visit him personally.
Cimest: Now, let us focus on the relic.
Cimest: The relic is down there. Pass the trial, and you may claim it.
Paimon: Paimon thought that the relic would be protected by some kind of seal, or guard, or... something.
Paimon: But it looks like it's just lying there, and it doesn't seem like anything's stopping someone from just taking it...

Paimon: C—Cursed! Uhh, in that case, let's just... go ahead and accept the trial...
Traveler: Why don't we just jump down and take it?
Traveler: That dragon must be huge...

## Talk 10

Souffache: Saborn, we must think of something!
Saborn: *sigh* ...You are no doubt right. But when have we ever managed to hold back the princess?
