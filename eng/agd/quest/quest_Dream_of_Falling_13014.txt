# Dream of Falling


## Talk 1

Pedrush: This lady refused to heed our warnings and fell asleep here a little earlier.

## Talk 2

Paimon: She seems to be in the same condition as Ilman earlier.
Nahida: Yes, but luckily, she hasn't been injured or jolted awake yet. Let's carefully move her somewhere safer.
Kathya: See you tomorrow, Professor Aisha...
Kathya: Hmm... Huh? Wh—Why am I back here again?
Traveler: Nobody else is here.
Kathya: Dreaming? But what about Professor Aisha...?
Kathya: Oh, I see. It was all just a dream... Well, that makes sense. After all, it hasn't changed a single bit.
Paimon: Huh? What's "it"?
Kathya: Nearly twenty years, and it still hasn't bloomed... *sigh*
Nahida: Does it have something to do with your dream? Please, tell us what you mean.
Kathya: Ah, sorry, I'm still feeling a little groggy. Please give me a moment here... Whew.
Kathya: Ahem, alright, where to start... Right, this plant... So, Professor Aisha gave me this plant just before she left.
Kathya: She was a good friend of my parents' and my first real tutor. She was also an outstanding Amurta researcher.
Kathya: In addition to her extraordinary academic talents, she was also skilled in combat, and would accept lots of work from the Adventurers' Guild.
Paimon: Oh, so you mean she's left on an adventure?
Kathya: Yes. When I was about ten years old, she told me that she must go look for the secrets of "the Abyss," and that she would be gone for a long time.
Kathya: I grabbed hold of her and wouldn't let go. I didn't know what "the Abyss" was... I just knew that she was like family to me.
Kathya: She hugged me, and we cried for some time until I fell asleep. When I woke up, I was already back home.
Kathya: She still decided to leave, but had left behind a letter for me saying that I was the person she cared for most in this world.
Kathya: She claimed that investigating "the Abyss" could help more ordinary people protect the people and things they care about.
Kathya: She had obtained some important evidence during her past adventures... If she didn't set off right away, she might miss the perfect opportunity.
Paimon: Guess "ad astra abyssosque" isn't just a slogan...
Kathya: She left a seed in the letter, telling me that if it sprouted and bloomed, then she'd come back, no matter what sort of risky situation she was in.
Kathya: She said she looked forward to seeing me all grown up...
Kathya: But strangely, I've tried watering it, feeding it, everything I could think of... but I've never been able to get it to bloom.
Kathya: I even went to ask the Amurta researchers, and they couldn't explain it, either.
Nahida: May I have a look at the plant?
Kathya: Of course. I was hoping the great Dendro Archon could help me solve this problem.
Nahida: Let me see. Hmm, oh...
Nahida: ...
Paimon: Huh, we've never seen that look on Nahida's face before.
Nahida: ...
Traveler: (Wait, could it be...!?)
Paimon: Sh—She looks a little unwell. Um, hold on, we'll be right back!
Paimon: What's wrong, Nahida? You can't tell what's wrong with the plant, either?
Nahida: No, I immediately understood what's happening with that plant... I'm just not sure if I should say it.
Nahida: This plant is not known to the academic world. It's a new species that her teacher managed to cultivate by some special means.
Nahida: Judging by its features, I can tell from the moment it sprouted, it'll never be able to bloom.
Paimon: I—It can't be...
Nahida: It means that this "Professor Aisha" she keeps mentioning might have foreseen the danger, and was prepared to never return.
Nahida: From my experience observing people, she would undoubtedly regard this as a "brutal" revelation.
Nahida: When forced to confront such "brutal" truths, people may break down into tears, talk nonsense, or lose their tempers...
Nahida: #I know she has to face the truth, but at the same time, I don't want to hurt her... Tell me, Traveler, what should I do?
Paimon: Yeah, that's a tricky one... Seems like you've already got a good idea of the feelings she might experience.
Traveler: I'll tell her.
Nahida: But wouldn't that mean I'm just pushing it all on you? What if she just gets angry at you instead?
Paimon: It's all right. There are all kinds of people, and the examples you observed are just the most extreme cases.
Traveler: I've seen many situations like this before.
Nahida: O—Okay... Thank you.
Paimon: Let's go back and tell her.
Kathya: Huh! It'll never bloom!?
Kathya: But how's that possible? If a plant is unable to bloom, doesn't that mean it can't reproduce, either? All that's left for it to do is slowly wither away!
Traveler: It seems like that may be exactly what your teacher intended.
Kathya: Are you saying... she never intended to return? Seriously? So everything she said was a lie...
Paimon: But she meant well! Since the separation was inevitable, she hoped that you would be able to come to grips with such a cruel parting a little later in life.
Traveler: She really cared about you.
Paimon: Yeah. Her love, care, and attention to you... All those warm moments were real.
Nahida: I guess she had hoped that you could understand and respect her choice after learning the truth.
Kathya: ...I see. Sorry, I don't want to sound ungrateful, but it's just... just so much to take in.
Kathya: The dreams are so beautiful, yet reality is heartlessly cold.
Kathya: I really thought she had come back. I had so much to tell her...
Traveler: I can understand your grief.
Nahida: These dreams may not be as pure and beautiful as they seem. Some kind of power may be exploiting your feelings.
Kathya: R—Really?
Nahida: Yes. So with that in mind, until our investigation is completed, please return to the event and ignore any further temptations from your dreams.
Kathya: I see, thank you for rescuing me and sorry for the trouble. Luckily, the plant didn't get hurt either.
Kathya: Otherwise, I wouldn't have anything left to remember her by.
Nahida: Thanks, Traveler and Paimon. She seems to have finally accepted the truth, but I think she'll still need a long time to come to terms with her feelings.
Nahida: I saw her waver the moment you mentioned love.
Nahida: It was almost like a gentle rain, arriving just in time to put out a fire that was about to spread.
Paimon: It's because people have something called "empathy."
Nahida: "Empathy"? Hmm, I see... This is valuable knowledge indeed.
Paimon: By the way, you said there may be something that's trying to exploit their feelings. Any idea what that might be?
Nahida: Yes. What's common between Ilman and Kathya's cases is that they've both lost someone dear to them.
Nahida: And now... they get to meet the people they cherish in their dreams again, and the people feel more real than anything a regular dream could hope to create.
Nahida: Instead of interpreting it as a result of their longing, I have to consider a more antagonistic explanation... Someone is taking advantage of their longing.
Traveler: But what would be the motive?
Paimon: Yeah, they're just causing these people to dream. What are they after?
Nahida: This is exactly what we need to investigate. Anyway, let's pay another visit to "A Moment of Dreams."
Nahida: I have a bad feeling about all of this... I hope things haven't gotten any worse.
Traveler: We're trying to investigate these dreams.
Traveler: She meant to convey a message through the plant's true nature.
Traveler: There's always a way to work through it.
Traveler: (An expression pleading for help?)
Traveler: You were dreaming just now.

## Talk 3

Nahida: We're back. How's everything here?
Pedrush: Uh, I am so sorry, great Dendro Archon. We're still trying to figure out how to explain the whole thing to everyone.
Pedrush: Because of your warning, we've brought dreamers here even if they were completely unaware of the danger.
Pedrush: But some of them have already fallen asleep, and they haven't woken up for a long time. I fear there's nothing we can do about it.
Pedrush: "A Moment of Dreams" is just a small interest group... We don't have enough staff members to handle this.
Nahida: Just as I expected, it seems my guess was correct.
Pawlin: It's the Dendro Archon. She's back!
Nasser: What happened? Why have we been gathered here?
Nahida: Many of you here have been experiencing some beautiful dreams.
Nahida: But I'm sorry to tell you that based on our investigation, there's some kind of conspiracy behind them.
Nahida: Before we learn the truth, please don't try to recreate the scenes in your dreams. Whatever you see, don't be tempted by them.
Pawlin: Huh? But...
Nasser: I don't think it's a big deal. Aren't we just dreaming? It's not like dreams will have an effect on others.
Nahida: We've already met two people who ran off to the countryside alone and got caught in dangerous situations by falling to the temptations in their dreams.
Paimon: That's right! These aren't just dreams — it's serious!
Nasser: All right... I get it, I get it.
Pawlin: So does that mean once we have some conclusive results from the investigation, we can continue to enjoy these dreams?
Nasser: Yeah, I still want to visit my sister in my dreams...
Traveler: No, not necessarily.
Nasser: I'm sorry if what I'm about to say sounds a little offensive, great Dendro Archon, but...
Nasser: We had a discussion with the folks who just arrived here... In all of our dreams, we were able to reunite with people who were very close to us.
Nasser: They all seemed as if they were alive again, which makes us reluctant to wake up.
Nahida: Yes, that's also what we've observed in our investigation.
Nasser: So, if the results of this investigation would mean an end to those dreams, that'd be quite cruel to us.
Nasser: All of us understand the danger, but... perhaps you can't quite understand just how much those people mean to us.
Nasser: I don't think everyone will be on board with the plan to abandon these dreams for good.
Nasser: Before the conclusion of the investigation, they'll at least want to meet the people in their dreams one last time and say goodbye.
Pedrush: We've never had such a difficult situation before. It appears that not many people are willing to cooperate.
Paimon: So they still want to return to their dreams despite knowing the danger?
Traveler: It's hard to clearly say who's right and who's wrong here.
Nahida: That's right. Compared with these sweet and beautiful dreams, our warnings of danger are dull and emotionless... It looks like the situation will inevitably spiral out of control.
Nahida: The more time we waste, the more people will ignore our warnings and return to their alluring dreams.
Paimon: So, what should we do?
Nahida: ...Seems we have to go into a dream and find out the truth for ourselves.
Nahida: Pedrush, is there anyone here who's experiencing a marvelous dream right now?
Pedrush: Ah, let me think... Yes, this way.
Nahida: Good, please take us there.
Traveler: Everyone has their own perspectives.
Traveler: It will depend on the results of our investigation.

## Talk 4

Paimon: What's wrong, Traveler? You look a little disoriented.
Traveler: ...No, it's nothing.
Paimon: Oh, okay. Just remember that Paimon is always here for you!
Paimon: Anyway, seems like we've made it into the dream!
Nahida: Hmm, I thought we would arrive at some familiar scene, but we seem to have landed in a completely unfamiliar place.
Paimon: Whoa, so many giant plants, even in the sky. Amazing...
Nahida: Theoretically, we should have gone straight into Debbi's dream. Things do seem to have gone a bit sideways here...
Nahida: Anyway, let's see if we can find any leads.
Traveler: It seems this whole dream situation is getting to me, too.
Paimon: Really? Paimon didn't notice anything...

## Talk 5

Haydar (Haydar?): ■■, what should I do? Where did ■■ go?
Maynar (Maynar?): ■■■ left because he doesn't want you anymore!

## Talk 6

Rakesh (Rakesh?): ■■, stop bossing me around!

## Talk 7

Paimon: Hey, this place looks familiar! Isn't it Puspa Café?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon sees Debbi. She's right over there! Looks like we've come to the right place.
Nahida: These alluring dreams often portray a scene from real life, which concurs with our previous findings.
Paimon: Really? But what about that space we were in just now?
Traveler: Maybe it was like some kind of hub.
Paimon: You can't mean... this is another collective dream!?
Nahida: Yes, given that so many people have been experiencing these beautiful dreams, I would say it's very likely that they're interconnected.
Nahida: Compared to an interconnected dream, independent individual dreams would be much harder to manage and manipulate.
Paimon: Ah, Paimon gets it now... Well, let's go talk with Debbi.
Paimon: Oh, but there are some other people next to her. Are they dreaming, too?
Nahida: If this space is exclusive to Debbi's dream, then the others beside her are most likely the people she cherishes.
Nahida: Anyway, we should confirm that first, just to be sure.
Paimon: Huh? How do we do that?
Nahida: Just leave it to me.
Traveler: The dreams may be connected.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Wait, weren't we already here a little earlier?
Nahida: This is probably Ilman's dream.
Paimon: Huh? Why would he start dreaming again?
Traveler: Didn't we warn him?
Nahida: Yes, but it seems that the danger isn't enough to stop him from longing for his wife.
Paimon: Based on what we've learned so far, he must be sleeping more deeply for his dream to appear here.
Nahida: But fortunately, he already knows us from before, so hopefully we'll be able to wake him up.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Huh, a door? Hmm, wonder where it could lead...
Paimon: It's not like we have any other way to go now. Let's go in and have a look.

## Talk 10

Moseis: Missing text (770079594)

## Talk 11

Paimon: Hmm, it looks like we may need to put something inside there...

## Talk 12

Emira (Emira?): ■■■, get away from there! Don't ruin my flowers!

## Talk 13

Paimon: Ah, monsters! Be careful!
Nahida: All of you, please get out of here and find somewhere safe!
Moseis: I am the master of this dream. I can create endless waves of monsters with the snap of a finger.
Moseis: Don't worry. They'll wake up before they get hurt. Emira doesn't like to see others in pain.
Moseis: If you know what's good for you, leave now.

## Talk 14

Paimon: Huh!? Are we back up here again? Ah wait, Paimon's confused! Are we up here or down there!?
Paimon: Whew, good thing we didn't fall, hehe...
Nahida: Yes we did, we just fell upwards.
Paimon: That's not helping, Nahida! Ugh, Paimon has no clue what's going on anymore!

## Talk 15

Paimon: Whoa, when it rains, it seems to disappear slowly.
Nahida: Yes, and it appears again as soon as the rain stops. It's less like a flower, and more like a Dendro Slime that's trying to keep out of sight.
Paimon: Heh, here we go again with Nahida's analogies...

## Talk 16

Paimon: Huh? What are we doing here again?
Paimon: Wait a second!? We were just up there, no... down there... Uh, did we go up or down?
Nahida: Don't panic, this is how dreams work.
Nahida: We've left Debbi's dream, but the dream is still continuing onward. I'm not sure where it'll lead us.
Nahida: This dream has the ability to create imaginary people, which is why people are so unwilling to wake up.
Paimon: If it weren't for what we just saw, Paimon might still find that a bit hard to believe...
Traveler: So what awaits us further in the dream?
Nahida: I have a guess. If these dreams are connected, then there should be some sort of order to them.
Nahida: The fact that Debbi was able to realize that she was dreaming means that she is not very deep in the dream yet.
Nahida: But the space we're in has been turned upside down. Do you remember the characteristics of dreams that I mentioned earlier?
Paimon: Oh right! Dreams are chaotic!
Nahida: That's right. It's possible that we're heading deeper into this dream now, and the deeper we go, the closer we'll get to the essence of the dream.
Paimon: Right, so the answers might be waiting for us deeper in the dream.
Traveler: We should hurry.
Nahida: Yes, and we should get ready for whatever we may encounter.

## Talk 17

Anisah (Anisah?): Ahhhhh, just shut up, ■■!

## Talk 18

Paimon: We're not doing something bad... are we, Nahida?
Nahida: That depends on how you define "good" and "bad."

## Talk 19

Shadiyah (Shadiyah?): ■■■, just decide for yourself!

## Talk 20

Paimon: All the water that used to be here has turned into rain.
Nahida: Then let's get through here before the water level rises.

## Talk 21

Emira (Emira?): Who... am I? I'm... not Emira. I'm ■■■.

## Talk 22

Paimon: We've finally made it. The destination is right ahead!

## Talk 23

Ilman: Haydar...

## Talk 24

Debbi: It's just sleepwalking, they're really overreacting.
Debbi: *yawn* I'm getting really sleepy.

## Talk 25

Nasser: It's just a dream. How bad could it be?

Ilman: Uh, I'm not sure what you're talking about... All we did was walk through that passageway, and here we are.
