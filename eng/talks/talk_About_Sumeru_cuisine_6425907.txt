Traveler: About Sumeru cuisine...
Jazari: Huh? I don't remember promising to treat you guys to any Sumeru cuisine.
Jazari: But since you've helped me out loads, I don't mind treating you to a meal of Curry Shrimp or something similar.
Jazari: But let's wait until my results have been published successfully. I'll make sure to fill your bellies, be it Curry Shrimp, or even Tandoori Roast Chicken!
