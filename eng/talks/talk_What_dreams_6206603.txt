Chaonan: What dreams?
Chaonan: ...I once had the opportunity to join The Crux, but by the time I signed up, they were full.
Chaonan: I gave up on the idea of being a seafarer in the end, and went into ship repair work instead. Now I can only watch as the ships go in and out.
Chaonan: Maybe if I'd pushed a little harder for it back in the day, I wouldn't have ended up where I am now.
Chaonan: And maybe the reason I've not been favored enough to receive a Vision is because I give up too easily.
Chaonan: ...I hope you don't end up like me.
