Traveler: Tell me about your past.
Granny Ruoxin: To be honest I wish I'd grown up here rather than in Liyue Harbor. Life would have been simpler, but more content.
Granny Ruoxin: I used to be an actress at the Heyu Tea House. I was living the high life, but when you're always acting there's a sense in which you lose touch with reality.
Granny Ruoxin: Back then, both I and the man I was with shared a dream of moving out to live in the country. We thought, even if that means no more fancy dinners and posh parties, life here will be genuine and everyone will be friendly.
Granny Ruoxin: I think I made the right choice in the end.
