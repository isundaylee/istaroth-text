Traveler: What are you muttering to yourself about?
Lixing: It's complicated... I'll try to give you a summary.
Lixing: I work for the Communications Office, and my job is to evaluate and optimize transport plans for designated routes.
Lixing: Even if the Communications Office is well-staffed, covering all the transportation work throughout Liyue is quite impossible, which is why we outsource some work to the local Secure Transport Agencies.
Lixing: But given how their equipment varies, controlling the transportation times with any precision is a nightmare.
Lixing: This, in turn, poses a considerable challenge to our planning capabilities...
Lixing: A situation like this will be difficult to turn around in the short term. After all, standardizing their equipment requires a huge investment.
Lixing: Local Secure Transport Agencies are usually unable to afford such large sums. They still have to live and eat, right? So, it's up to us to eke a solution out somehow...
