(Quest is part of chapter: Khvarena of Good and Evil)

# The Hymn of Tir Yazad


## Talk 1

Sorush: The Great Songs of Khvarena are, at their heart, comprised of past memories.

## Talk 2

Sorush: The Sinless Seedlings shall have grown out by now.

## Talk 3

Rashnu: What took Sorush so long...
Mihir: We've been waiting here for a very long time.
Rashnu: I'm so tired... I want to... go back to sleep. Zzz...
Sorush: Hey, that's not fair. I'm the one who's been laboring hard all along and you didn't do anything!
Mihir: That's not true. Waiting is also an important job. In fact, acting is only momentary while waiting is eternal.
Paimon: What's with this weird logic...
Mihir: That's just the philosophy of us Pari.
Mihir: But now is not the time to discuss philosophies. What matters is the Great Songs of Khvarena. I trust you've collected all of them, no?
Paimon: Of course we have!
Mihir: In that case, let us remove the seal. Then you can gather the power of Khvarena with the Great Songs.
Mihir: But be careful. Since the filth has been building up for centuries, I have no idea what will emerge once I remove the seal.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Now that we've placed the Great Khvarena properly, everything around here seems to have recovered!
Mihir: These trees were originally cultivated with Khvarena to resist the corrosion of the cataclysm. It's just that their power has ebbed away with the passage of time.
Mihir: With the Great Songs' nourishment, they will be able to regain their former glory.
Mihir: But with the seal removed now, the filth from the past has been freed, too.
Mihir: The rite won't be able to continue if Rashnu and I spend all our energy here. So please take care of these locations for us.
Sorush: Hehe, leave it to me! It's the Bloomguard's job to fight defilement!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Mm, our work is done!
Paimon: It seems that some flowers have grown on the tree. But what do we do next?
Mihir: Ah, don't look at me. I'm as clueless as you.
Mihir: Now that Sorush has already put on the Twin-Horned Chaplet, she can connect to the memories and wisdom of the Harvisptokhm using the Chaplet.
Mihir: Give it a try, Sorush.
Sorush: I know, but I'm not yet used to the Chaplet!
Sorush: Um... I think I see new shoots sprouting, but the filth hasn't been fully cleansed yet.
Sorush: We still need to purify these flowers.
Sorush: Then the pure power of Khvarena will thrive again.

## Talk 6

Paimon: It's gotten quiet, finally.
Mihir: Now, perform the Rite of Chinvat before the filth starts to ooze out again.
Mihir: Then our job will be done.
Rashnu: And that means... I can sleep in peace... without anyone disturbing me.
Mihir: Come on, Sorush!
Rashnu: Sorush, hurry up!
Mihir: It has to be the three of us.

## Talk 7

Mihir: Done. The path to the depths has opened, and our mission is completed.
Paimon: Huh, that was quick. You kept talking about "rite" and stuff, so Paimon thought it'd take a whole bunch of complicated incantations to conduct.
Mihir: Hmph, only humans need such things, as they can't even wield the power of the elements on their own.
Mihir: We Pari are different, for our power and that of the Khvarena hail from the same source. It's like how you humans don't need to recite incantations to walk.
Mihir: Um... Although you don't walk, you float.
Paimon: Like Paimon said, your logic is weird.
Mihir: Anyway, let's not waste our time on this irrelevant topic. I'll leave what's next up to you.
Mihir: "May the eternal Khvarena guide us on the upward path."

Zurvan: Then, please extinguish the Sign of Apaosha. You will know what transpired in the past once you're inside the Harvisptokhm.
Zurvan: We will meet again when Amrita falls from the sky.

Mihir: Whether it is Sorush or myself, all Pari have a duty that they must undertake.
