# Aroma of the Past


## Talk 1

Paimon: Windcoming Day is finally here. Let's get a move on, or we'll miss the toasting ceremony!

## Talk 2

Klee: Honorary Knight, Razor, over here! Look who it is!
Paimon: Wow, it's Diona! Paimon was sure we'd run into you at The Cat's Tail stand some time, but so far, we haven't seen you all festival!
Diona: Ooh... Traitors...
Paimon: Uhh... Umm, wh—what?
Diona: Arrrggghhh!!! I'm SO. MAD.
Diona: Klee told me the whole story. So this bright idea was the brain child of you two, hmm? How could you? Razor is Daddy's friend... and he was a good influence... right up until YOU got him interested in wine!
Diona: Razor, you'd better promise me that you won't turn into one of those old boozehounds that drinks themselves silly, slumps over the bar, and bursts into tears!
Razor: I, uh... I don't understand.
Paimon: Sounds like there's been some crossed wires here...
Paimon: Klee, what exactly did you say to Diona?
Klee: Ummmm... I told her that Razor's looking for his mommy with the Honorary Knight's help, and you both seemed really sad, and said you needed some wine, so maybe Diona could help...
Klee: But before I finished, Diona said, "Klee, say no more, I'm getting involved in this if it's the last thing I do." And... then we came here...
Traveler: ...
Razor: Uh...
Paimon: Huh... okay... Paimon doesn't even know where to start. Diona, it sounds like Klee left out a few important details in this story. Let us set the record straight...
Black Screen Text: You explain the situation to Diona...
Diona: So you're saying... Razor wants to make the same wine that his mother and father once made, so he can learn more about them? ...Hmm, you'd better not be making this up to try and pull the wool over my eyes...
Traveler: No way.
Klee: Sorry, Diona, it was all Klee's fault for not explaining it properly.
Klee: So... are you still mad? Or can you help Razor make the wine?
Klee: I caught a bunch of fish for us to eat. Um... and you can pet Dodoco too if you want.
Diona: ...I—I wasn't THAT angry.
Diona: You were just trying to help. I understand.
Diona: I just don't want Razor being led astray, that's all. That's why I may have raised my voice a little bit just now... Hmm, well, since none of you plan on drinking it, then I suppose I can help you just this once, despite my reservations.
Diona: But I need you to know that I'm a mixer, not a brewer, so I'm used to working with the finished product. If you really want me to start with a bunch of raw ingredients, that's fine, but I can't make any promises about how it'll turn out...
Klee: Yay! Diona is the best!
Razor: Hehe.
Traveler: Don't worry, Diona, you got this!
Diona: Hmph, bunch of flatterers. Now watch this.
Black Screen Text: Diona puts her signature mixological magic to work...
Paimon: All done! That was quick!
Paimon: Now we just need to find a place to store it.
Paimon: "We wait, wait for a windier day." ...Hmm, does that mean we need to put it somewhere exposed to the wind?
Razor: Maybe... Windrise? Very windy.
Paimon: Yep! If you say the word "windy," that's the first place on every Mondstadter's mind.
Klee: Cool, I wanna come, too!
Diona: I have to keep an eye on my foolish father, so I won't be joining you.
Diona: Klee, come and play again some other time.
Klee: I will! I promise!
Traveler: You can do it, Diona!
Traveler: Absolutely not.

## Talk 3

Venti: Ah, what a curious coincidence meeting you here!
Paimon: Tone-Deaf Bard? What are you doing here?
Venti: Well, I awoke to the most magnificent aroma in the air. After following the sweet scent of fresh fruit to its source, this is where I ended up.
Klee: Yeah, the fruit are super fresh and super-duper sweet! I can smell it as well!
Traveler: There's another reason, isn't there?
Venti: Yes. Oh ah, I remembered something important. Something that you have to do before sealing the barrel and burying it in the ground.
Klee: What? We missed something!?
Venti: Razor, do you still remember the scent of that half-bottle of Thousand-Wind Wine? I believe there was a hint of bitterness in there?
Razor: Yes, there was.
Venti: Hahaha, and with very good reason, too. The source? ...This.
Paimon: Dandelion Seeds?
Venti: You're familiar with Dandelion Wine, right? Well, the people of Mondstadt believe that the wind can bring back the soul, and also preserve memories.
Venti: Dandelion Seeds are like living gemstones, formed from the first wisps of wind in the year. People add them to the mix at the last second as a way of capturing the wind in the very moment that the barrel is sealed.
Venti: The memory of that moment is then stored in the wine, for all time.
Venti: So, Thousand-Wind Wine is the original Dandelion Wine.
Paimon: Whoa!
Klee: That's so cool! So now our story will be made into wine, too!
Venti: As for why it always has a different scent... Well, that's because people have the freedom to include whatever ingredients they want, hehe~
Razor: Hmm...
Klee: What is it, Razor? Whatcha thinkin' about?
Razor: In mother and father's wine, I can smell Dandelion Seeds, but I don't know what else.
Razor: In my wine, there is a lot of... friendship.
Razor: I still don't understand my mother and father, but... I still have you, and everyone else.
Razor: Everyone has done so much for me.
Razor: Varka, Teacher, Klee, Bennett, Uncle Brown Cat, cold lady, grown-up with fake smile...
Razor: Grey tough girl, person that smells like Anemo Crystalfly, Uncle Browncat's daughter...
Razor: #Green bard, Paimon, and Traveler.
Razor: I remember everyone.
Razor: Making wine... is hard work.
Razor: Making this wine needed everyone, working together.
Razor: Hard work with friends... not so hard after all.
Razor: I'm... I'm so happy.
Traveler: We are all glad to help.
Razor: Thank you.
Razor: Friends... are also lupical.
Razor: Whether I'm human, or I'm wolf... it doesn't matter. From now on, all of us are together.
Razor: When I grow up, we will come back here. And we will open this wine... together.
Venti: What a magnificent monologue. Even as a bard, I don't feel like there's anything else to add.
Venti: All that remains now is to bury the barrel and wait, wait for the fruit to ferment.
Black Screen Text: The group buries the barrel in the ground...
Paimon: We're finally done. Paimon feels like a celebration is in order!
Paimon: If Paimon remembers correctly, tomorrow should be Windcoming Day, right?
Klee: Wow! The Anemo God is coming home!
Venti: Hahaha, that reminds me — I haven't memorized the song for the toasting ceremony yet. I'd better get back. Friends, I shall see you all tomorrow.
Venti: Get a good night's sleep tonight. Wait for the whisper of the gentle breeze to rouse you tomorrow morning, then come and enjoy a performance by the greatest bard to ever grace the streets of Mondstadt.
Traveler: It makes us happy to see you happy.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Wow, so many people have shown up to welcome the Anemo Archon. ...Huh? Why is everyone crowded around the Angel's Share stand?
Lisa: Tradition holds that the finest wine of the Weinlesefest only goes on sale after the Anemo Archon has tasted it at the toasting ceremony. Everyone's waiting in line for the big moment.
Paimon: Ugh, so welcoming the Anemo Archon back is just a means to an end for them, huh... What about you, Lisa? Are you here for Razor?
Lisa: Yes, I was still feeling a little concerned about him. But I just spoke with him, and he tells me that the wine-making went very smoothly. Ah, such a relief... A glass of the festival's finest will go down smoothly now, too.
Paimon: Wow, you too, huh...
Lisa: Hehe. Razor and the others are over there. You should go say hi.
Bennett: Hey hey, there you are!
Paimon: Whoa, what's with all these bottles? Selling your own home brew now?
Bennett: Haha, these are for Razor, from us!
Klee: Mommy said that everyone is welcoming the Anemo God today, and we need to give him some wine. If the Anemo God likes the wine, he'll turn into the wind and bless everyone.
Klee: We want the Anemo God to be happy so he helps Razor. Oh, Honorary Knight, look what Albedo let me borrow.
Bennett: This bottle is from my dads. Luckily I managed not to break it on the way here... It's just for show, though, I have to give it back to them afterwards.
Klee: Mommy said that the Anemo God can drink a looot of wine. She said if he wanted to, he could drink the whole of Cider Lake in one big gulp!
Klee: So... d'you think we have enough between these and the wine Razor's parents left behind?
Razor: Ahh, green bard.
Venti: Ahem... Everyone, I am greatly honored to be able to be here today. I have been invited by Acting Grand Master Jean of the Knights of Favonius to perform a piece for everyone: "Thousand-Wind Wine."
Venti: It is some of the finest verse I know. I dedicate it to the wind, and to everyone here with us today:
Venti: "Fill up the barrels and store them away,
Then wait, wait for a windier day.
Wax the bottles, seal them tight,
For the south wind that soothes, for the north wind that bites."
Venti: "How does this fine wine taste to the tongue?
As 'Mondstadt' to the ear: like a sweet dream of freedom.
And what are the fruits that went into the brew?
An explorer's courage, a love tender and true."
Venti: "A defender's will, strong as yesteryear,
Joining the thousand winds in a song of good cheer,
Turning sour into sweet, bitter notes fade away,
As we wait, wait for a windier day."
Venti: "Pray tell, what treasure does this barrel hold?
'Tis wheat's greatest triumph, the true liquid gold.
As it flows from the keg, what sound drifts by?
Wind chimes in the boundless, immemorial sky."
Venti: "We raise up our glasses, and voices in song,
As we wait, wait for the wind to sing along.
Where do we turn once the thousand winds take flight?
To the tales of the lyre, to the sweet dream of tonight."
Jean: Dear friends, let us now open the wines.
Bennett (Crowd): To the Anemo Archon!
Razor: To the Anemo Archon...
Traveler: To the Anemo Archon.
Klee: Umm... There's no wind...
Razor: Don't feel sad, Klee.
Klee: But why didn't he come? If the Anemo God didn't come home... is it because he doesn't like the wine we brought for him?
Traveler: I don't think so...
Paimon: Of course not! You know, Klee, the wind isn't the only form that the Anemo Archon can turn into. He can turn into anything! So today, he must've come back looking like something else!
Klee: Huh? Really? Maybe he turned into... a Jumpy Dumpty!
Paimon: Sure! Jumpy Dumpty it is! Hope you're listening, Anemo Archon!
Klee: Heehee... Razor, did the Anemo Archon bring you a blessing?
Razor: Yes.
Razor: I talked a lot with you all, and I learned a lot.
Razor: Now, I am not afraid.
Razor: I think that is a blessing.
Bennett: Don't forget to save me a glass of your wine once it's finished fermenting!
Traveler: Will I get some, too?
Razor: Yes. We share together, and we remember together.
Klee: Yay! But... now I'm getting thirsty...
Paimon: We've all done a lot of talking. Let's go get something to drink, shall we?
Bennett: I heard that the Angel's Share is selling a new drink called "Fruits of the Festival." Everyone's saying it's delicious!
Klee: I want some, I want some!
Razor: Okay, everyone, let's go.
Traveler: It will remind us of this moment.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Klee: Razor, you were sooo cool back there!
Razor: Cool? But inside, I feel warm...
Klee: No, not like that. When you think something's awesome, you can say it's "cool," or "sweet"!
Razor: Oh... Hmm, but I think Klee is sweet.

### Additional Talk 2

Noelle: Overall, I think this task was a success...
Noelle: Oh no! Sucrose's lab equipment! I should go help her carry it!
