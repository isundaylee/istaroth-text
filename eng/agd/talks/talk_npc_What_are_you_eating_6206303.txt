Francis: What are you eating?
Francis: Only the best food that Liyue has to offer â€” Li cuisine!
Francis: Whether it's Mora Meat, with a glimmer that's even more dazzling than the Mora spent to purchase it...
Francis: Or the delectable Come and Get It, with its assortment of exotic Liyue delicacies all packed into a single cask...
Francis: And the rich aromas... Ahh, it's hard to imagine that anything, with just one whiff, could ever be so irresistible. Prepared with just the right amount of seasoning and spices, it's simply exquisite!
