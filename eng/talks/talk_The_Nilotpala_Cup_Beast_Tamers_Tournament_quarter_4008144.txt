Message Board: "To be honest, even though the competitions are exciting, the Fungi's abilities should really be applied in other areas as well. For example, they should be used to escort caravans or to guard the city."
Message Board: "If that happens, a lot of the pressure will be taken off the Corps of Thirty, and merchants wouldn't need to spend so much money on hiring bodyguards."
Message Board: "Goods might even become cheaper when the cost decreases! After all, I'm sure the merchants factor the cost of hiring bodyguards into the sale price of the goods. We, the customers, are the ones that pay for it."
Message Board: "So I think it's safe to say that it could be very beneficial for us ordinary people if this event were to become even more popular!"

Message Board: "Haha, I can tell that you're an amateur from your comment! The strong abilities of Stretchy Geo Fungi come at a cost â€” the skill can't be used frequently in combat, and Stretchy Geo Fungi can easily be focused down!"
Message Board: "If you use proper team composition, you'll be able to limit the Stretchy Geo Fungi's combat capabilities!"
