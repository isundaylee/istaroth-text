Tanamart: How can I save enough money to buy a custom-made axe with floral carvings from the blacksmith's shop...

## Talk

Traveler: What do you need that for?
Tanamart: To use as a weapon, of course.
Tanamart: I might just be a homemaker right now, but I used to be a mercenary with the Eremites, so I always feel uneasy without a weapon at home.
Tanamart: Peace is precious, but you must always be prepared for the worst.

Traveler: See you.
Tanamart: See you. Whether you're out or at home, make sure you stay safe.

## Talk

Traveler: I can relate to that.
Tanamart: *sigh* If only my useless husband could think like you...
Tanamart: The more money he makes, the more bows and arrows I can buy to keep my house safe. After all, the storage and maintenance of weapons are very important.
