Traveler: Who are you?
Tunner: Me? Pals in the winery call me Old Tunner. I'm a farmer here at the Dawn Winery.
Tunner: My family has been farming here for generations. Most of the good wines you've had were probably fermented using the grapes here.
Tunner: Every owner of the winery has been treating our family very generously.
Tunner: But I don't think it's a good thing for my son to inherit this land and become a farmer for his whole life...

Traveler: Your son?
Tunner: Guy! His name is Guy, my beloved son!
Tunner: What? You've never heard of him? Hahaha, that's fine. Sooner or later, you'll know him. The whole Mondstadt will know him...
Tunner: My son, Guy, told me he was going to be the strongest Knight of Favonius! I believe in him.
Tunner: I spent all my hard-earned money for his sake, to give him a better future than mine.
Tunner: Guy is determined to fulfill his dream! He became a squire at 16, so our household has been relying on him since.
