# What is the Meaning of Life?


## Talk 1

Iaune: Well, that's all the feed I got. Hope they're all full...
Traveler: What are you up to?
Iaune: I'm feeding these gulls. See, they've almost had their fill.
Paimon: Whoa... When did you and them grow so close?
Traveler: They didn't steal your fries?
Iaune: No. It seems that people specifically come here to feed the gulls, so they've no interest in my fries.
Paimon: But didn't you say that if you got too far from your workplace, you might miss work?
Iaune: Hahaha, it's alright. Today's my day off.
Iaune: No colleagues here to drag me into work-related chat, and no one or animal to steal my fries... Yes, this is a most suitable place.
Iaune: The gulls are a friendly lot. They won't steal my fries, nor will they come charging into me to cause a riot.
Iaune: Ever since I fed them personally a few times, they seem to recognize me. They don't seem to resist even when I touch their feathers.
Iaune: I'd go so far as to call them perfect gentlemen compared to the ilk at the Palais Mermonia.
Iaune: If they could use their talons to write using typewriters, why, they'd nearly put us out of work.
Traveler: Violetgold Angler Gulls won't help with human business.
Iaune: But at least they don't make things worse, either. And everyone knows that some things are simply too hard for them.
Iaune: But let's leave that aside first. Would you like to try making friends with these gentle-gulls?
Paimon: Whew, they're already gentle-birdies in your eyes, huh...
Traveler: Would it be rude of me to just go up to them?
Iaune: No, they are a tolerant sort. As long as you don't ruffle their feathers, you'll be fine.
Iaune: Come, let me give you this fish I've specially processed. Just take it and put it in that bowl over there.
Iaune: Just relax. Violetgold Angler Gulls are a tolerant lot. They like whoever feeds them, and they ask no questions about where you got your fish or how it was made.
Traveler: Is there anything I need to look out for when befriending them?
Iaune: Not much, not really. Just don't attempt to ruffle their feathers directly.
Traveler: Violetgold Angler Gulls don't speak our language.
Iaune: I wouldn't be so sure. Perhaps they simply pretend so that they may live more comfortable lives.

## Talk 2

Iaune: What did I say, eh? Real gentlemen â€” far better mannered than those ruffians near the Palais Mermonia.
Traveler: They were very well-mannered.
Iaune: I know, right? Makes me feel relaxed just sitting here.
Iaune: I mean, just imagine being a gull yourself. With people coming over to feed you, all you need to do is sunbathe and think about the meaning of life...
Iaune: *sigh* Why am I a Gestionnaire and not a Violetgold Angler Gull?

### Additional Talk 1

Iaune: How... How could you do that? They're not the ruffians in front of the Palais Mermonia, you know!
Traveler: Sorry, it was an accident...
Iaune: *sigh* I didn't even have time to stop you. Why did you do that... Did one of them attack you?
Iaune: Regardless, they're gone now. Oh well. I'll have to come back in a few days and offer them some food as an apology...
