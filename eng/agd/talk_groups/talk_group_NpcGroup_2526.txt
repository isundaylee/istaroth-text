Woliu: The qualities of the soil and water, its specific composition... All of this is worth careful study...

Traveler: You seem to be studying something very profound.
Woliu: It may sound profound, but if we're talking about the basic principles, it's more like... analyzing the various ingredients and seasoning of a dish?
Woliu: The most difficult part of this job is obtaining samples and determining effective components, both of which require highly specialized equipment to complete.
Woliu: Sometimes, I even use consumable devices from Fontaine in addition to my equipment from Liyue.
Woliu: If you carefully calculate the costs, this work is a pretty expensive undertaking! Without an appropriate organization allocating funds, most people couldn't handle all the required outlays.
Woliu: Even researchers sent by the Akademiya probably can't cover all of the expenses, so just trying to transplant tea trees from Chenyu Vale to Sumeru is a fool's errand.
Woliu: As far as the Ministry of Civil Affairs is concerned, if we can completely understand the composition of the soil, and determine the essential components critical for commercial crops...
Woliu: Then it'll be easy to pump up production of our biggest cash crops!
Woliu: Yeah, when I think about it that way, my work is pretty awesome!

Traveler: See you.
Woliu: ...Huh. Was someone speaking to me just now?

## Talk 1

Traveler: And you are?
Woliu: Hello there! I'm Woliu, a hydrologist working for the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and currently conducting a routine survey of Chenyu Vale's hydrological and pedological conditions.
Woliu: Hmm, looking at you... You wouldn't happen to be an adventurer, would you? Excellent, perfect... Perhaps we'll get a chance to work together!

## Talk 4

Traveler: Ms. Woliu, how have you been?
Woliu: We meet again. I'm still surveying the hydrological and soil conditions.
Woliu: I remember the slick moves you showed me last time. If it's possible, I'd like to work with you again next time. As for the reward... I guarantee you'll be satisfied!

## Talk 5

Woliu: The flow of water is good, and the conditions of the waters in the surrounding areas are quite satisfactory as well... This is great.
Woliu: I should still keep an eye on the surrounding soil environment, though. Looks like I'll have to place a few more instruments...
Traveler: Did something happen here?
Woliu: Ah, are you the Traveler? Could you spare a moment? I could really... use a favor from you.
Woliu: Please allow me to introduce myself first. I'm Woliu, a hydrologist. I'm currently conducting some investigations in Chenyu Vale for research purposes.
Traveler: Why would a hydrologist need to keep an eye on the soil environment?
Woliu: That's a very good question. The short answer is that the study of hydrology concerns more than just the movement of water.
Woliu: The mountainous terrain, the flow of the streams, the geology of the land, the weather of the area, and even the daily lives of the human residents who call this place their home... they all affect the hydrology of the vale.
Paimon: Pâ€”Paimon can't say she really understands, but that definitely sounds super complicated...
Woliu: It is indeed quite complicated. Still, conducting research here is far easier than conducting research in Fontaine.
Woliu: I kept running into all kinds of problems trying to place even a single hydrology device in Fontaine. They'd get attacked by the aquatic wildlife one day, and be swept away by the currents the next...
Woliu: And that's not even going into all of those underwater mechanical things that archons-know-who placed down there... Ugh, just remembering all of this is giving me a headache.
Traveler: So, about the favor you'd like to ask of us...
Woliu: Ah, that... Well, it's really a small thing. I'd like to request that you help me place these monitoring instruments on that mountain.
Woliu: I have just ordered these mechanical instruments from Fontaine. Once placed, they will continuously bore down through the earth until they've obtained the deep soil samples that I require.
Woliu: With those samples, I'll be able to measure the influence the local hydrology has had on the soil quality of the nearby mountains.
Traveler: That sounds straightforward enough.
Woliu: If that's... what you think. I've been meaning to hire a few adventurers for the task, but no one has accepted my commission so far, and I've heard that there are a lot of Treasure Hoarders in the area...
Woliu: But judging from your looks, you're not at all scared of those bullies, are you?
Traveler: Just leave them to me.
Woliu: Then, I leave the placement of the instruments to you. All you need is to place them on the nearby hill.
Woliu: I still need to stay here to adjust some more instruments. Just come back to me once you've placed the batch that I've given you.
Traveler: If they're smart, they should be scared of me.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_NPC): It's been a while since we got such a simple commission.
