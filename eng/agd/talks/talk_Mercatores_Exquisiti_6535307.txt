Traveler: Mercatores Exquisiti?
Foscari: That's right, my friend! We Mercatores Exquisiti are our God King's most loyal!
Foscari: And it was for this fealty that he gave us trade permits, allowing us to conduct business with nations beyond our high sea.
Foscari: Of course, that is not the full extent of our special privileges.
Foscari: We also have the right to bypass any Vicarius, and to make slaves free citizens. We even have the right to make contact with barbarians...
Foscari: As long as it aligns with the Golden Symphony's interests, any deed is permissible.
