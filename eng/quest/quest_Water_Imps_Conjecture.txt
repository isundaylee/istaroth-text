# Water Imp's Conjecture


## Talk 1

Paimon: Is this the stretch of water Delaroche was talking about? It looks really peaceful... Huh? Look, there are some footprints over there...

## Talk 2

Freminet: I've stored Thelxie in the tent. He can respond to some simple verbal commands. You can try calling his name and see if he'll come over.

## Talk 3

Thelxie: -.. -... .-- -...?
Paimon: So that's Freminet's version of Thelxie. It's also penguin-shaped, just like Pers!
Freminet: Yep. Had Thelxie lived in Penguin Town, he'd probably have become great friends with Pers.
Traveler: Where's Penguin Town?
Freminet: ...It's not really anywhere famous or important. Don't worry about it.
Paimon: Hey, Thelxie! Nice to meet you! Do you know how to say hello?
Thelxie: -.. -... .-- -...?
Traveler: So can Thelxie talk?
Freminet: I wanted to install a language output module, but due to time constraints, I had to give up on the idea.
Freminet: As it stands, Thelxie can only output messages that were pre-written into its motherboard. I haven't given him the ability to convert those messages into discernable words, so... he can't really talk to us just yet.
Paimon: Uh... no need to get so technical! So basically, you want us to help you complete and install this language module, right?
Freminet: No, there's no need, that wasn't one of my employer's requests. It was just something I wanted to try...
Freminet: I have two other things I'd like your help with... The first is to do some integration testing on Thelxie's motherboard to make sure he will be able to function properly in most situations.
Paimon: That doesn't sound too hard... And what's the other thing?
Freminet: The other shouldn't take too long either... You'll need to find Thelxie some colorful shells and coral so I can craft a weapon for him.
Paimon: A weapon? Will Thelxie have to fight?
Freminet: Mm hmm, Thelxie will need to be able to charge forward with a weapon in hand like that brave prince of legend. It's a part of my employer's request.
Paimon: What an imaginative employer! Naming Thelxie after a Water Imp, but wanting him to look like a prince...
Freminet: Well, regardless of his role or species, Thelxie's purpose is the same. Just like Pers, he has come to this world to serve as somebody's companion.
Thelxie: -.. .--. -. --.- -... .... --- .--- ..-.
Paimon: Whoa, Thelxie just said something again! Could he understand what we were just talking about?
Freminet: He can react to certain keywords, but unfortunately, due to the lack of a translation module, he still can't quite communicate with us...
Paimon: ...That's a pity, but anyway, the most important thing right now is for us to get to work! Maybe let's start by doing some testing on the motherboard, that sounds like something we can do here in the camp.
Freminet: Sounds good. The motherboard is on my workbench, so please follow me.
Freminet: Ah, here we go. I have this testing manual, so feel free to reference it if you get stuck.
Freminet: Want to give it a try? It's okay if you don't succeed immediately. I've got a lot of backup boards just in case.
Traveler: I'll give it a try.
Freminet: Okay. Knowing you, I'm sure you'll be able to figure it out.

## Talk 4

Thelxie: -.. -... .-- -...?

## Talk 5

Paimon: Whoa, sounds pretty advanced! Let Paimon give it a try. Hey, Thelxie, are you there?

## Talk 6

Freminet: You're doing well... just as I expected.
Paimon: We've taken on a lot of similar tasks before, you know!
Freminet: Then let's move on to the underwater part. It's just as I mentioned earlier — we're after colorful shells and coral.
Freminet: Oh, speaking of which, you're both already pretty used to Fontaine's underwater environment, right?
Traveler: ...More or less.
Freminet: Okay, that's good. Just let me know if you ever feel uncomfortable — I'll make sure to stay right by your side.
Traveler: We're pretty much experts now.

## Talk 7

Zuria Destree: ♪♫♪~
Zuria Destree: Ah Freminet, you're back! I thought you might have been out diving.
Freminet: I'm sorry, Madame Destree... I must have kept you waiting. I can report, though, that the construction of Thelxie is going quite smoothly.
Zuria Destree: There's no rush. I'm your employer, not your supervisor. And these two are...?
Freminet: Ah, they are two of my trustworthy companions. They're here to help me work on Thelxie.
Zuria Destree: Yes, I see... I suppose it's only natural for someone responsible like you to have some reliable friends.
Paimon: #It's really nice to meet you, Madame Destree! Are you Freminet's employer? Paimon is Paimon, and this is Traveler.
Zuria Destree: Greetings, my new friends. Just call me Zuria. You are both so adorable — the sight of you reminds me of little fairies under a cottage roof.
Paimon: Hehe, do you really think so?
Traveler: Do I look like a fairy, too?
Zuria Destree: Of course, if my child had friends like you, then perhaps he wouldn't have become so obsessed with the tales of Water Imps, and I wouldn't have had to trouble Freminet here with this commission.
Paimon: Obsessed with... the tales of Water Imps?
Zuria Destree: Ah, so you don't know anything about my request yet? I would have thought Freminet had explained to you already.
Paimon: Well, Freminet told us that it was a private matter, so he didn't want to just share it willy-nilly.
Zuria Destree: I see, so Monsieur Freminet is even more discreet than I had thought. Hmm... as you are assisting him with the project, I believe it'll be beneficial for you to learn more about its vision and history.
Zuria Destree: But it would be quite impolite of me to simply pile all of my troubles on you without your permission. So... would you like to listen to my story?
Paimon: Sure, you can tell us anything! You've already said nice things about us, so we'll try our best to help you get through your troubles!
Zuria Destree: Ah, what a lovely little fairy... Then let me think of a way to put my situation into words. Hmm... I'm sure you are already familiar with the tale of the Water Imps, right?
Zuria Destree: Simply put, parents came up with a story painting Water Imps as scary abductors in an effort to convince their children to stay away from the water. My child is rather special, however. While most other children are terrified of Thelxie... he's infatuated with him.
Paimon: In—Infatuated with a Water Imp? What a brave soul!
Zuria Destree: Yes, he told me that he thought the Water Imp might have just been misunderstood. In his mind, instead of singing to abduct children, the Water Imp actually sang out of a longing for companionship. As a result, he often goes near the water in secret.
Paimon: Huh... So he wanted to become friends with the Water Imp so it wouldn't be lonely any longer? What a unique way of thinking!
Zuria Destree: Thank you, little Paimon. He indeed has always stood out from the crowd... He was actually diagnosed with Loneliness Syndrome when he was only eight years old...
Traveler: Loneliness Syndrome?
Zuria Destree: Mhm, it's a type of mental disorder. Those affected by it often feel extremely lonely, and lose interest in many mundane activities. The syndrome is probably what made him so determined to become friends with the Water Imp.
Paimon: Oh no... Is it a very serious disorder?
Freminet: #If you were to become afflicted with the disorder, Paimon, you would only be able to say less than a fraction of the words you're saying to Traveler now.
Paimon: #No, Paimon won't accept that! We would have to find a doctor to help cure Paimon! Paimon has a 2,000-word quota for daily conversations with Traveler, and she won't settle for a single word less!
Zuria Destree: The family doctor has already begun to treat my son... but since the disorder is rare, there aren't many good regimens for treatment. He's also developed some new symptoms lately... such as uncontrollable delusions.
Paimon: Huh? Uncontrollable what now?
Freminet: Uncontrollable delusions. To put it simply, he can no longer differentiate between fantasy and reality, and spends all his time in his fantasy world...
Paimon: Then... Then what is he seeing in his fantasy world?
Zuria Destree: It's a dream that he often mentioned to me when he was younger. I've compiled what I could understand of his recent rambling. It goes a bit like this...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): Once upon a time, there was a splendid and magnificent underwater Kingdom of Water Imps on the Salacia Plain, five hundred feet beneath the surface.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): Before the festival, all Water Imps would select the most precious pearl they owned, wrap it in golden branches and leaves, and offer it to their most beloved prince.
Paimon: Amazing... your son came up with all of this? He really crafted a lovely fairytale world for Thelxie. It's like a beautiful dream.
Zuria Destree: But perhaps no beautiful dream can ever last long. You see, the story ended with a twist...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): The Day of the Iridescence Parade came as expected, but countless monsters also arrived alongside the prince...
Paimon: How could the story end like this...? Is that kind of fantasizing what caused your son to develop his Loneliness Syndrome?
Freminet: Well, it'd be more accurate to say that it was the syndrome that caused such terrible delusions to manifest... But in any case, the biggest problem is the patient eventually loses themselves to the fantasy world of their own creation.
Traveler: What do you mean?
Zuria Destree: My poor child can no longer differentiate between imagination and reality... He's begun to see himself as Thelxie.
Freminet: Perhaps in his mind, the loneliness he felt became the same as that of a prince who lost everything he ever loved or stood for.
Paimon: What!? So that's what you mean by "uncontrollable delusions"... Then we have to help him snap out of it!
Zuria Destree: Alas... Most of the time, he acts as if he can no longer sense or interact with the real world at all. I've had several discussions with the doctor, and we think it is best to try to guide his fantasy.
Traveler: Guide his fantasy?
Zuria Destree: He once wanted to make a picture book of his imaginary world, but since the disorder progressed too quickly, he never quite got past the first page of the book. If we could use this book as a breakthrough for his condition... Here, you can take a look.
Paimon: Ah, so Zuria's son also saw Thelxie as a penguin... Aw, he looks so sad...
Zuria Destree: What we should do now is help him complete this picture book. However, we'll lead the story to a different ending... one where the Water Imp Prince is eventually able to restore his kingdom with the help of his friends.
Zuria Destree: We'll need to chase away his loneliness and sorrow and let him perceive a world full of hope again. That's what I mean by "guiding his fantasy."
Paimon: But if we just need to finish the picture book, why does Freminet need to make a Thelxie as well?
Zuria Destree: Because we need to treat the book's story seriously, as if it's a history of things that have really happened. We'll need to go on a journey like Thelxie and help him regain his crown and country.
Zuria Destree: But... my child can no longer go on a journey of his own. This is why I commissioned Freminet here to craft a "Thelxie," and then I'll paint the journey with this Thelxie into the picture book.
Paimon: Ahh, like a stand-in for your son! Paimon's starting to get it now... You really put a lot of thought into this, Zuria. Paimon still has one question, though — where will we be able to find a Water Imp kingdom?
Zuria Destree: There are some ruins on the seabed of the Salacia Plains. I've already asked Freminet to research them for me. We'll be able to use one of the ruins as the kingdom.
Paimon: Oh! So we'll just need to act out a performance of, uh, "A Brave Journey Through the Kingdom of Water Imps." As long as we chase away the monsters in the ruins, it'll count as chasing away the monsters in the Water Imp kingdom, right?
Freminet: Sadly no... We won't be just putting on a performance. It's just as Zuria said... We need to take this seriously, and the only way we can take this seriously is if we choose to believe everything that's happening is real.
Paimon: Uh... So we'll be playing it straight? Or uh... making it a fully immersive experience? Ugh, neither of those really sound right. Ah well, either way, we'll still be able to help, right?
Traveler: I'll try my best.
Traveler: We've got this!
Zuria Destree: It's alright, there's no need to get that serious. It's not a big deal — I believe in my son, we can just see this as him wanting to stay asleep for a bit longer because he's so enamored with his dream.
Freminet: Zuria...
Zuria Destree: Keep your spirits up, everyone. If we were to look troubled, my son is sure to become anxious as well... Hmm, I should be heading back right about now to check on my son.
Zuria Destree: We temporarily moved to a place on the hill over there so my son will have a better spot to convalesce. It's not far from the water and there's also a great view. Feel free to come find me if anything urgent comes up.
Freminet: Understood. There's also one last thing... since these two friends were able to help me out, I've made some more progress on Thelxie. I estimate that he should be ready sometime tomorrow.
Zuria Destree: That's great news — I must thank you all. Hmm, with that in mind, how about we meet here in two days' time to head to the Kingdom of Water Imps?
Traveler: Sounds good.
Zuria Destree: Alright everyone, let's meet again in another two days.
Paimon: Zuria sure is a brave and optimistic lady... Freminet, do you think her plan will work out?
Freminet: ...Let's discuss that over by the tent. There were a few things that I didn't bring up because the madame was here.

## Talk 8

Freminet: Alright, these should be enough. Let's head back to camp... Thank you for staying out here with me all this time.
