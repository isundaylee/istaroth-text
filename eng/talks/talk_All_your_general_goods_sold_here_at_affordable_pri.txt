Mats: All your general goods sold here at affordable prices, come and take a look!
Traveler: And you are...
Mats: Well, if it isn't the Honorary Knight! It's a pleasure to meet you!
Mats: I was doing business abroad previously, and I normally only come back during Weinlesefest. It's no surprise that we haven't met before.
Mats: If it's meant to be, I'm sure we'll meet again elsewhere!
Traveler: How's business these days?
Mats: Not bad at all!
Mats: As you can see, Weinlesefest is swarming with guests! I can make as much in one day here as I normally would in four or five!
Mats: I wish there were more lively festivals like this one!
Traveler: See you.
Mats: See you, may we meet again!
