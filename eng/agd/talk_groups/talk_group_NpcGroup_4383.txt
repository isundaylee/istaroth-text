Nargess: My colleagues must be working very hard to write project applications right now.

Traveler: Project applications?
Nargess: Mm-hmm, everyone knows that to ensure good funding, you have to get your application approved by the Akademiya. With an approved project and Mora, you can hire more students.
Nargess: With students working for you and stable funding from the Akademiya, your bright future will very much be secured.
Nargess: But I don't think it's really worth it. Just think about the terrible competition you'll face. It's too much trouble to get your application approved.
Nargess: And I heard that the Akademiya has given all its funding to some secret projects lately. So no one can really get a single Mora out of their applications. What a waste of time!

Traveler: Project applications?
Nargess: That's right. Everyone knows that to ensure good funding, you have to get your application approved by the Akademiya first. With an approved project and Mora, you'll be able to hire more students.
Nargess: With students working for you and stable funding from the Akademiya, your bright future will very much be secured.
Nargess: Still, I don't think it's really worth it. Just think about the terrible competition you'll face. All in all, it's too much trouble to get your application approved.
Nargess: I mean, have you heard about how Azar put all his eggs in that one basket of his, and not only did it turn out empty, but he also lost his position in the process?
Nargess: It's all a big joke, I tell you.
