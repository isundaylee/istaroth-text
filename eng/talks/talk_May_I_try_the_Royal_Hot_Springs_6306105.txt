Traveler: May I try the Royal Hot Springs?
Mikawa Akane: I'm sorry. I can't let you do that.
Mikawa Akane: The Royal Hot Springs are only for those from the Shogunate. Access priority is based on a strict hierarchical system.
Mikawa Akane: With private rooms and very few customers, it is also often the place for our lords' private discussions. No outlanders allowed.
