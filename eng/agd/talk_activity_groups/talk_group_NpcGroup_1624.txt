Traveler: Best of luck.
Chang the Ninth: Haha, I'll take your well-wishes to heart!
Chang the Ninth: Truth be told, I really owe you for helping me so much last time.
Chang the Ninth: Here, you can have these Noctilucous Jades. They're not expensive by any means, but do take them as a keepsake.

## Talk

Chang the Ninth: If you're here to make fun of an old man, you picked the wrong one. I don't take any nonsense.

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Chang the Ninth: Not to scare you off, but I'm none other than the once-illustrious Chang the Ninth of Feiyun Slope!
Chang the Ninth: Back in Liyue, in the good old days, so many Mora went through my hands every day that I couldn't give you an exact number. Anyone who wanted to do business knew it was me they had to impress!
Chang the Ninth: Hmph, even those big-shot Liyue Qixing would have to move aside if I told them they were in my way!
Traveler: So... why did you move here to live as a hermit?
Chang the Ninth: It was a somewhat... unexpected turn of events. The business started going downhill, so I thought I'd sell the old abode and move out here, where it's peaceful and quiet, to get away from it all.
Chang the Ninth: The ancients had a saying, "He who has not known poverty has yet to become a true man." I might only have this hut and my book collection to my name, but I'm optimistic that my time will come again sooner or later.
Chang the Ninth: I'm wondering about the mineral trade, maybe... Well, I shan't say any more or I'd be handing you a business opportunity on a silver platter!
Chang the Ninth: But when my time comes, everyone in Liyue Harbor is going to know that old Chang the Ninth is finally back again!
Traveler: Do you get on with your neighbors?
Chang the Ninth: You mean those penniless peasants? Ugh, the fact I even have to live near them...
Chang the Ninth: I may be their neighbor now — only due to circumstance I might add — but ohh you mark my words, when I have restored my business to its rightful place in the world, they won't even be worthy to farm the ground I walk upon!

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Chang the Ninth: Hmph. If you've no serious business here then take your idle chatter elsewhere.

## Talk

Chang the Ninth: What wind has brought you today? Please, come in, come in.

## Talk

Traveler: Have we met?
Chang the Ninth: You don't remember me? It's me, Chang the Ninth! You once bought a mountain of Cor Lapis from me!
Chang the Ninth: I imagine you've met a great many people, it's to be expected that you wouldn't remember...
Chang the Ninth: I remember when I used to do my business on Feiyun Slope. People would fight to do business with me... *sigh* Not like now...

## Talk

Traveler: So what happened?
Chang the Ninth: Thanks to you, I was able to sell that Cor Lapis at a good price. You effectively saved my life in the process.
Chang the Ninth: I know my gut feeling won't lead me astray. Sure, I've had a few business deals go south, but that which makes money will make money.
Chang the Ninth: Just watch, I used that money to buy more ore. Once my ore business really gets going, I can finally get out of this dump.
Chang the Ninth: But when my time comes, everyone in Liyue Harbor is going to know that old Chang the Ninth is finally back again!

## Talk

Traveler: We're gonna get going.
Chang the Ninth: Earth be solid beneath your feet. We will meet again in Liyue in due time.

## Talk

Traveler: About Xingqiu...
Chang the Ninth: Oh yeah, that Guhua kid... Haven't seen him since that day. Getting up to something inexplicable no doubt...
Chang the Ninth: But don't you find it odd? Surely his story isn't as simple as that...
Chang the Ninth: Forget it, it's got nothing to do with me.

## Talk

Traveler: How are the neighbors?
Chang the Ninth: You mean those penniless peasants? Ugh, the fact I even have to live near them...
Chang the Ninth: I may be their neighbor now — only due to circumstance I might add — but ohh you mark my words, when I have restored my business to its rightful place in the world, they won't even be worthy to farm the ground I walk upon!
