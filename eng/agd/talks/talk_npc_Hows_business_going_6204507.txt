Traveler: How's business going?
Chef Mao: Oh, come on. How could business here at Wanmin Restaurant's be slow?
Chef Mao: One taste of our handiwork will turn most people into regulars.
Chef Mao: ...Speaking of regulars, we've had a young lady with a strange headdress come in pretty often lately. The vegetarian dishes on our menu seem quite to her taste.
Chef Mao: But I've noticed that she only ever orders the vegetarian dishes, and in very small amounts, too.
Chef Mao: I gave her a larger portion out of sympathy, but she seemed quite reluctant to accept it. Is she trying to maintain her physique? Young ladies nowadays really are serious about such things...
