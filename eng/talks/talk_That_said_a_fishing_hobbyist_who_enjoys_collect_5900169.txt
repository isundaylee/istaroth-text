Damestier: That said... a fishing hobbyist who enjoys collecting Mekafish did tell me that there seem to be Condessence Crystals and Magical Crystal Ore nearby...
Damestier: What do you think he meant by saying that? That he might make more Mekafish using those ores? ... Ugh, he'd better not. The Mekafish population shouldn't be allowed to grow, no sir!
Damestier: Ugh, what to do... Wait, do you need ore? What would you say to going over there and grabbing it all first?
