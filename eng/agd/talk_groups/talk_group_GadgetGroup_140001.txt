Night Raven Flight Attendant: Welcome, dear guest. Nachtraben Airlines, at your service...
Night Raven Flight Attendant: Hmm? You know us not? Well now, allow me to make introduction.
Night Raven Flight Attendant: We Night Ravens have returned to the castle at our Prinzessin's behest. Yet, it is located on high, and reaching it has proven quite the ordeal. Thus has a path been made through the wind to our keep.
Night Raven Flight Attendant: Naturally, it is not only for our use. You may make use of it as well... But you will require a Nightwatch Contract from Her Highness...

Night Raven Flight Attendant: Behold, her elegant words and writing... Come, dear guest, allow me to grant you passage immediately!
