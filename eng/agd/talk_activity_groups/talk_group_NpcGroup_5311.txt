Canotila: Since memories can be made into books, if we reverse the logic, books can also be written directly into memories...
Canotila: Hmm... What is it? Is there something you'd like to ask?

## Talk

Traveler: About the Book of Revealing...
Canotila: Hmm. No matter how I think about this, converting memories into books is quite the incredible deed...
Canotila: The creator of this book must've only been able to do this because they viewed the emotions in their memories as the most precious thing in the world.
Canotila: That doesn't change how difficult its contents are to parse, though...

## Talk

Traveler: I've got a new page with me...
Canotila: Ooh, if you've found one or more new pages, just put them inside the book. Let's see what happens!

## Talk

Traveler: Not really.
Canotila: Alright... Oh, yes. If you ever feel sad, come over here â€” let's meditate together. Maybe that'll help cheer you up.

## Talk

Traveler: About the earthquake just a while ago...
Canotila: Earthquake? Oh, you mean that bit a moment ago where everything was swaying? Well, I was thinking about other things, so I didn't pay much attention...

## Talk

Canotila: ...

## Talk

Traveler: About the Book of Revealing...
Canotila: #...So scary! Terrifying! If it wasn't for Mr. Traveler, I don't know what would've happened to me.
Canotila: But why? Why would monsters appear in such a beautiful place? Is it really that...
Canotila: Nope! Not gonna keep thinking about that. It wasn't easy for me to forge a life for myself here.
Canotila: If you find another page, or want to meditate... The book hasn't moved. But please, be careful.

## Talk

Traveler: Are you alright?
Canotila: Thank you. If it wasn't for you, I might never have made it back.
Canotila: Merusea Village is beautiful, and everyone is really nice. I should treasure life here a little more, and the "world" around me.
Canotila: Perhaps, the world of "meditation" is not as wonderful as I once thought?

## Talk

Traveler: Take care.
Canotila: Yes. Thank you.
