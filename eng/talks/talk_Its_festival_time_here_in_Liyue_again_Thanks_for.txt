Vlad: It's festival time here in Liyue again. Thanks for accepting my invitation to view the moon together...
Vlad: I'd originally planned to invite you to some famous restaurant, but I didn't think that they'd been fully booked ages ago...
Nadia: It's alright. I've heard that the theme of this festival is gourmet food. It's not all that surprising that there were no tables left.
Vlad: Eh? Iâ€”Is that so... So that's why I couldn't book any seats...
Vlad: Looks like my lack of understanding about Liyue was to blame. I'm sorry...
Nadia: Eh? Oh, no, you don't have to apologize...
Nadia: Just being able to relax and watch the bright moon together is good enough for me.
Nadia: Don't you think the moon at this time is brighter and rounder than usual?
Vlad: Oh, is it? ...No, I mean... You're right. It truly is very beautiful.
