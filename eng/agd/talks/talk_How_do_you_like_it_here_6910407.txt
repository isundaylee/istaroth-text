# Talk Dialog

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Chasca: Well... It'll certainly take some getting used to.
Chasca: This place is so peaceful, it's almost uncanny. No howling wind, ferocious beasts, crashing waves, bustling crowds... None of that.
Chasca: And that constant sense of restlessness inside me... It finally feels calm. It's so... strange.
Traveler: Fancy a spar?
Chasca: No thanks. I don't want to disturb the peace. It's not an easy feeling to come by.
Chasca: There's already more than enough conflict and discord in the world. This is a nice escape.
Chasca: Thank you for bringing me here.
Traveler: Strange in a bad way?
Chasca: No, not at all. It's a nice change of pace.
