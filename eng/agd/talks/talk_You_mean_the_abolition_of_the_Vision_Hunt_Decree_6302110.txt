Traveler: You mean the abolition of the Vision Hunt Decree?
Hasegawa: The Vision Hunt Decree... Well, that didn't really bother me anyway.
Hasegawa: After all, there aren't that many people with Visions, so it really didn't affect me.
Hasegawa: As for the things they experienced while dispossessed of their Visions... Well, I'm not sure. Does it have anything to do with me, though?
