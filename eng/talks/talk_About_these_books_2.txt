Traveler: About these books...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Fascinating, no? These books have all been infused with the mysterious power of the "symphony." They can be activated using the melodies of the music box.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Well done. It looks as if you can now skillfully manipulate this musical might. I was right to put my faith in you.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): There are many books like this one in the castle. Back in the day...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Nay, let us not dwell on the past. I believe you are fully capable of discovering the mysteries within.
