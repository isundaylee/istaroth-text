# The Woven and the Cut


## Talk 1

Chiori: Ah, you're here.
Paimon: Chiori! How are the new outfits coming along? Uh, you look kinda tired.
Chiori: Just a few steps left, now. I've handed the rest over to Eloffe. We should be able to make tonight's show.
Paimon: Wow, that's cutting it real close... Are you sure she'll be okay without you?
Chiori: Don't worry, I have no intention of giving ground on either front. With the fashion show scheduled for tonight, Uther has closed his factory — this is our only chance to secure any incriminating evidence.
Paimon: Okay, Paimon totally gets that this is all his fault and he totally deserves it, but wouldn't we technically be trespassing on his property if we just barge in like this?
Chiori: His factory is usually open to the public. It may not be open for business right now, but that doesn't mean visitors can't stop by for a tour.
Chiori: We're just curious customers after all, aren't we?
Paimon: Well, when you put it that way...
Chiori: Anyway, Uther's factory is right over there. Let's hurry up and get moving.
Paimon: Uhh... Why would he open a factory over... there?
Chiori: We have different marketing strategies. While I specialize in high-end, custom garments, he prefers low prices and large sales volumes. I dunno... Maybe the rent here is cheap.
Paimon: Alright, but Paimon's just gonna be the first to say... this place gives her the creeps. Paimon would never choose to buy anything from a place like this.
Chiori: You make a good point. Let's all be on our guard.

## Talk 4

Paimon: This place is filthy... Are the clothes from Uther's shop seriously made here?
Chiori: ...Look over there.
Paimon: Ugh... That water looks super nasty. Paimon can smell the stench from all the way over here...
Chiori: Hmph... And I was the one using unsafe materials, Uther?
Paimon: So he was actually the one who opened an underground factory...
Chiori: No wonder his clothes always felt weird to the touch...
Chiori: He's been using all manner of tricks here in a bid to cut costs.
Paimon: Should... Should the clothes made here even be worn?
Chiori: Never mind issues with shrinking and fading... These materials can give you skin problems if you wear them too often.
Paimon: That's terrifying... Let's take some photos right away as evidence!
Paimon: This way, he won't be able to try and deny anything in court! Alright, let's keep going.

## Talk 5

Paimon: This place seems like some kind of warehouse. Blech... And it stinks, too.
Paimon: Huh!? What's going on? Our way in's been blocked!
Traveler: He wants to trap us in the factory...
Chiori: ...
Chiori: Seems like he knew we'd be coming.
Paimon: You did say he knew you really well, didn't you?
Chiori: Yes. And that's because... we used to be partners.
Paimon: B—But you're practically at each other's throats! Now you're telling us you used to work together!?
Chiori: When I first came to Fontaine, we were both fledging designers who longed to gain a foothold in the world of fashion. We shared the same goal, so we decided to work together.
Chiori: In the beginning, we both wanted to make clothes that would stand out from the crowd and shatter tradition — the kind of clothes that would turn heads and leave people in awe.
Chiori: But with every criticism we received, and every sponsor that rejected us... Uther's confidence disappeared little by little.
Chiori: Finally, right before Fashion Week, he came to the conclusion that we wouldn't be able to make the designs we always dreamed of, and we parted ways.
Chiori: For my part, I gambled it all and devoted everything I had to that one week... I came out the other side with something that really made me proud. I was nervous to present it, of course, but I knew it was my chance to show the industry what I was made of. In the end, well...
Paimon: You received the acclaim of all Fontaine, while Uther gave up on his dream and turned to making this sketchy stuff?
Chiori: I don't know the exact details of what happened after that. All I know is, after I opened Chioriya Boutique, he's harassed me every year since.
Paimon: Hmph! He's just jealous of what you've accomplished. A guy like that doesn't deserve your sympathy.
Chiori: Well, let's focus on getting out of here first.
Chiori: Missing the show is as good as letting him win.
Paimon: Ah, there are some control panels over there! Let's see if any of those buttons do anything!

## Talk 6

Letters on the Table (Read): Some letters lie scattered on the table...
Traveler: Letter From Emilie
Letters on the Table (Letter From Emilie): "...Thank you, Ms. Chiori, for your feedback on the fragrances. I've placed a sample of my newest product in this letter. It's a recent experiment with a Romaritime fragrance..."
Letters on the Table (Letter From Emilie): "Also, about the schedule for the next test..."
Traveler: Letter From Navia
Letters on the Table (Letter From Navia): "It's a Spina party this evening, and you're invited!"

Letters on the Table (Letter From Chevreuse): "...His wife... a regular customer at your store. Please keep an eye out."

## Talk 7

Paper on the Bookshelf: (Some examples of Uther's old designs. There's nothing strange about them.)

## Talk 8

Paimon: Finally! The entrance... at last...
Uther: ...Oh? Those chambers couldn't hold you, I see. What a surprise.
Paimon: We've collected a bunch of evidence on all the nasty stuff happening at your factory! You're not getting away this time, Uther!
Uther: The evidence on your person, you mean? Hah, what makes you think I have any intention of letting it get past these walls?
Chiori: ...More mechanical guards? Really? Ever thought about using these funds for a legitimate purpose?
Uther: Oh, but this is a legitimate purpose.
Chiori: What? Destroying Chioriya Boutique? Or continuing to make your rotten rags?
Uther: —Proving that "fashion" is merely a laughable farce, a carnival of ignorance!
Chiori: ...You know what your problem is, Uther? You've become so obsessed with the concept of "fashion" itself, that you let it paralyze you. Stop trying to cater to it. Focus on your own work, and you get to decide what "fashion" means!
Uther: Spare me the lecture, why don't you. Sooner or later, you'll cater to all the voices too, you know. After all, what is "fashion" but another form of public opinion?
Chiori: Fashion is about aspiring towards a certain ideal, but it's up to you to decide what it is. My brand caters to no one but myself and my vision — that's my ideal, and it's not going to change.
Uther: Hmph. Well, once the people witness their former darling's spectacular fall, they'll understand how laughable that ideal truly is.
Chiori: That's what you've been trying to prove all this time? Your jaded understanding of the industry is the reason you've had it out for my brand for so long?
Chiori: ...You weren't like this before, Uther. What happened to the man who wanted to make something that would bring the entire world to its knees?
Uther: He realized long ago how utterly naive and ridiculous that dream was!
Chiori: ...You gave up on your dream, but that wasn't enough, was it? You had to find a way to prove to yourself that it could never have been possible at all.
Chiori: You think you understand... but you're just a bitter man who let his regrets dictate his choices. You regret giving up on your dream, so you stopped at nothing to prove to yourself that it wasn't the wrong choice.
Chiori: This whole thing, Uther — It's pathetic.
Uther: Pathetic? Why don't you take a look in the mirror? You're a fool daydreaming about "taking all of Teyvat by storm." Well, good luck doing that when even Fontaine doesn't have a place for you anymore!
Chiori: ...
Chiori: ...You're right. Maybe all those who pursue their dreams are fools.
Chiori: But more pitiful still are cowards who are too afraid to even attempt what the fool is brave enough to try.
Uther: You...!
Traveler: ...Chiori, you go first.
Paimon: Yeah, just leave this guy to us!
Chiori: No, you go instead.
Paimon: But... He has a gun...
Chiori: It'll be fine. Just go to the venue and tell everyone to proceed with the plan.
Chiori: I'll deal with him. Some lessons... are best delivered in person.
Traveler: ...Alright.
Paimon: Catch up with us soon!
Uther: Trying to leave, are we?
Black Screen Text: Missing text (4211312434)
Chiori: I've held back all this time because of our past partnership, Uther...
Uther: ...
Chiori: But all that changed after our "tour" of your factory.
Uther: Hmph... Still trying to talk tough, I see.
Chiori: No matter what you've been through, no matter why you've become like this...
Chiori: If I may borrow the words of a friend — a guy like you doesn't deserve my sympathy.
Uther: ...
Chiori: Allow me to show you... the true meaning of the Chioriya brand.
Traveler: ...Stay safe.
Traveler: ...You've got a show to catch.

## Talk 9

Navia: ...How about this?
Chiori: A little more to the left.
Kirara: ...Like this?
Chiori: Perfect.
Kirara: Phew!
Charlotte: Ooh! That looks great! Miss Chiori, can I take a picture?
Chiori: Of course.
Kirara: I didn't know you'd made a brand-new signboard!
Chiori: I made it before Fashion Week. I figured it'd be best to put it up after the success of the show.
Navia: Well, how can you become renowned through all of Teyvat without a fancy signboard of your own? The Spina's way ahead of you in that regard!
Lyney: Now that you mention it, perhaps our magic troupe could use one of those.
Lynette: Our signatures are the Grin-Malkin Cat and the Bogglecat Box. Oh, and we'd need to add Pers as well.
Lyney: Pers would need an alias, of course. Hmm, how about... the "Hangry Bird"?
Navia: Pfft... Hahaha!
Chiori: So does that mean your signboard is going to be... two cats and a penguin stuffed into a single hat?
Kirara: Ooh, that sounds super snuggly and warm!
Lynette: And a bit cramped...
Charlotte: #Miss Chiori! I'm done taking pictures. You can expect the article in tomorrow's Steambird, along with the evidence Traveler gathered!
Chiori: Thank you, Charlotte.
Charlotte: It's my pleasure! Bringing the truth to light is a journalist's duty.
Chiori: Going forward, feel free to custom-order any accessories you need for Monsieur Verite. It's on the house.
Charlotte: Huh!? Y—You really mean it?
Chiori: Of course. The same goes for you too, Lyney, Lynette. If you have need of any costumes in future, just drop me a note.
Lynette: What about something other than a costume?
Lyney: Thank you, Chiori. It's much appreciated.
Navia: Well, I don't really need anything! Just don't be a stranger, alright?
Kirara: I don't need anything, either! So long as you continue to request my international courier services from Komaniya Express, we're golden!
Navia: Actually, that reminds me... When will you be leaving, Kirara?
Kirara: Huh!? Erm... About that...
Navia: The Spina di Rosula has prepared a special vehicle for you, so you can just get in, and we'll push it all the way out of Fontaine!
Kirara: What, no, that's so embarrassing!
Paimon: Ooh, do we get something nice too, Chiori?
Chiori: Of course. Just hold on a second...
Chevreuse: Disrupting public order at the show, appropriating venue lighting equipment without authorization, using weaponry in public, hosting a dangerous performance without notifying the authorities...
Paimon: Um, Chevreuse, we can explain...
Chevreuse: ...If you come across anyone who matches those descriptions, please report them to the Special Patrol at your earliest convenience.
Chiori: Enjoyed that, didn't you? You nearly scared me half to death!
Chevreuse: Says the one who pulled that stunt earlier. How about you do me a favor and tell me in advance next time you're planning something like that?
Chiori: And if I had, would you have approved?
Chevreuse: No, but it would've at least spared me a whole lot of anxiety.
Chiori: Well, I would say I've more than made it up to you, have I not? A whole underground workshop in the Fleuve Cendre, and the man responsible all tied up and handed to you on a silver platter! Sounds pretty thoughtful, if you ask me.
Chevreuse: ...Alright, I won't argue with you. You can have this one.
Navia: Well, friends, I would say we've earned ourselves a nice meal for our efforts! Let's go! Spina's treat!
Chevreuse: I'll have to take a raincheck. I've still got a lot of paperwork to take care of, so you all go have fun.
Chevreuse: By the way, Chiori, I ran into Wenger on the way here. He had a message for you.
Chiori: I don't need to hear it — I'm sure the old fool used pretty much every apology in the book. I'll just visit him some other day and give him a hard time about everything.
Chevreuse: Hah, you know him well.
Chiori: Thanks again, Chevreuse.
Chevreuse: My pleasure. Oh, and one last thing—
Chevreuse: That was really quite an amazing show.
Chiori: You don't say?
Navia: Alright, alright, follow me if you want in on the celebration feast! Come on, we're leaving!
Chiori: #Traveler, Paimon, could you go wait for me at that place with the view? I'll let Navia know that we'll be a little late. There's something I'd like to give you.
Paimon: A place with a view? Ooh! Paimon knows where you mean! Sure, no problem!
Chiori: Perfect. I'll be right there.

## Talk 10

Chiori: Sorry to keep you waiting.
Paimon: We didn't wait long at all! But what did you wanna give us that you couldn't share right in front of everyone else?
Chiori: ...Here. Take this.
Paimon: Oh wow... a brooch! And in the style of Chioriya Boutique, too! Wait, Paimon gets one as well?
Chiori: I've only made two for now. After much consideration, I decided to give them to you two.
Traveler: Thank you...
Chiori: You've been a great help. Even when things were looking bleak, you stayed by my side.
Chiori: There were even times when I felt like I had to fight back and win, even if it was just to honor the trust that you had in me.
Paimon: Well, we may have helped a little, but Paimon would say you deserve most of the credit. This result... It was all you, Chiori!
Chiori: I know for certain that was not the case.
Chiori: I've chased my dream for so long that I've come to understand something...
Chiori: Apart from conviction and persistence, the thing that matters the most is having friends who believe in you even when you don't believe in yourself.
Chiori: A single person can only do so much. Without all your help, Chioriya Boutique could have easily fallen to ruin.
Paimon: Well, Paimon doesn't think it would have ever gotten to that point... Not if you had anything to say about it. But, um, about the stuff you said at the show... You aren't worried it'll rub some people the wrong way?
Chiori: Perhaps my words were a little pretentious, but they do reflect how I truly feel. I won't bow or scrape before any force in this world, much less any individual.
Chiori: I'm confident in the quality of my work. Create something beautiful, and there will always be people who appreciate it.
Paimon: Well, guess there's nothing to worry about, then!
Paimon: Should we go back and join them at the victory feast?
Chiori: Oh yes, of course. But before that, I'd like to admire the view for just a little while longer.
Chiori: You know? Of all the nights I've spent in Fontaine, I'd say this is the loveliest by far.
Traveler: I'll take good care of it.
