# Connor's Brew


## Talk 1

Traveler: So, I hear you need dandelions...
Connor: Oh, you must have seen my commission, then. Well, what about it? Have you gathered three sets of Dandelion Seeds?
Traveler: Here they are.
Traveler: Not yet.
Connor: Not yet, eh... Well, be sure to give them to me once you've got them. I need to start brewing wine soon.

## Talk 2

Connor: Yes... These Dandelion Seeds should last me for a while.
Connor: Please accept this. Thanks for helping me out.
