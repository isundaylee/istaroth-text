Traveler: Surely it isn't as simple as that...
Victoria: Hmph. Sharp people always make enemies of others.
Victoria: Some people were born in the sun, and thus take light and warmth for granted.
Victoria: But love, piety, holiness... all these wonderful things were built on the blood and tears of sinners.
Victoria: Can you all not see it, or do you just look away?
Victoria: If that's the case, then don't ask or think about it too much. When sin comes knocking, judgment will soon follow.
Victoria: Take what I've said as a warning. Take this with you, too. I hope it will keep you vigilant.

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Victoria: Ever since Stormterror appeared, there have been many more people coming to confession. This is an unexpected boon.
Victoria: But it matters little. Even if Stormterror hadn't arrived, I have ways and means of making people confess... of their own accord...
Victoria: In a manner of speaking, of course. Don't think about it too much. *chuckles*

Victoria: I have an update about Albert.
Victoria: Has he left?
Traveler: Yes, he's gone.
Victoria: Well, that's that sorted... But, what on earth were you doing sweeping leaves just now?
Victoria: Never mind, I suppose no more leaves means one less excuse Albert can use to get near the Cathedral in future.
Victoria: These gifts are my way of saying thank-you. Take them, and may the Anemo Archon protect you.
Victoria: If there's nothing else, I should get back to work. You should get back to yours, too.

Traveler: Is there anywhere good to go in Mondstadt?
Victoria: My child, I sense that whatever grave sin you carry with you is weighing heavily on your heart... The best place for you now is surely the confessional?
