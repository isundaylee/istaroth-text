Traveler: I've only heard the name.
Shatir: What? You don't know about him? Hm... Well, he has been busy recently with the thing about the next Grand Conservator.

Shatir: After all, if the person in charge of the collections is as unreasonable as the one managing the funds, this study will be dead in the water.
