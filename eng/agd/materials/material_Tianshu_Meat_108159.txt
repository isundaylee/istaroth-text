# Tianshu Meat

A braised meat dish. The cut of meat used is a happy medium between lean and fatty, and has been braised to smoking perfection. The ingredients glisten, and are soft but not greasy. Word has it that the Tianshu of a certain generation of the Liyue Qixing invented this dish after much painstaking development.
