Message: "Speaking of which, the tea trade has been booming, yet there are fewer tea clippers coming from Liyue. Is someone deliberately driving up prices?"
Another Person's Message: "I returned from Yilong Wharf last month, where I found bulk tea to be significantly more expensive than previously. I can't imagine there is much profit in the trade recently. Perhaps spices would be better..."
Ms. Cassigneul's Reply: "Tea prices continue to fluctuate within a reasonable range. Please refer to official sources for market updates and do not believe, act on, or spread unconfirmed rumors."
