Traveler: How was that?
Yukio: Wow. What a brilliant recreation! That said, even I have no clue what this song's called, haha.
Yukio: A fox-eared customer of ours likes humming this one when she comes over for some ramen. She's one of our VIPs. Came round a few days ago, in fact, or I wouldn't have remembered that song at all.
Yukio: ...I guess that tells you all you need to know about me and music, eh?
Yukio: If you're looking for a food stall, I'd recommend you look for Tomoki.
Yukio: That fellow's got a right adventurous spirit. Even if he isn't a fan of music, he should be interested nonetheless.
