# Brand-New Invitation Board!

Shuyun: Alright, now that Prince has made a few adjustments to the Invitation Board, everyone with an invite can now enter this special room here and duel with you.
Shuyun: Your friends won't have to travel long distances to get here. Moreover, the room makes it convenient for anyone to stay for a duel, regardless of who they are.
Shuyun: Huh? What do you mean, "there's no way a cat can accomplish such an impossible feat"? Hmph, you still have a lot to learn about Prince.
Shuyun: By which I mean, you still don't know a thing about what cats are capable of! Anyway, feel free to use the new Invitation Board and invite your friends for a duel in the special room!
