# The Gourmet Supremos: The Seashore Strider


## Talk 1

Xudong: This dish certainly does have a very "Julie"-esque feel to it.
Parvaneh: In fact, the first time I saw it, I thought it must've come from Mondstadt. But as it turns out, it's a local specialty instead.
Julie: I bet it tastes just as good as its name sounds, Xudong! C'mon, let's make some, please!
Traveler: We meet again.
Xudong: Oh, it's you, Traveler! Hehe, see, what did I tell you about us meeting again?
Julie: Xudong's picked up a new recipe from the city! It's called Crab Roe Kourayaki. Pretty good name, huh?
Xudong: It's not that hard to make either. But it does require a great number of crabs...
Xudong: I've prepared some normal crabs, and now I'm looking for some... special ones.
Traveler: Special crabs?
Xudong: Exactly! In specific, we're going for the ones that dwell under that Thunder Sakura!
Parvaneh: You might as well say "thunderstruck crabs"...
Xudong: Well, I'm just curious, you know? I wonder what crabs that live under such circumstances will taste like...
Xudong: However, with lightning flashing all around that tree, I daren't get too close.
Parvaneh: My book states that just like before, you just need to touch a Thunder Sakura Bough and cause an Electrogranum to attach to you...
Parvaneh: And that way, you won't be struck by the lightning from the Thunder Sakura.
Parvaneh: But well, you've seen what that tree looks like. I'm not going to risk it based off such a rough summary of a solution.
Xudong: Wouldn't it work if we just ran fast enough?
Parvaneh: Are you daft? Do you think you can run faster than lightning!?
Julie: Well, why don't we just use a stick to pull those crabs out and stuff...
Parvaneh: If you ask me, we might as well dig some ditch nearby. That'll draw both the water and the crabs out.
Xudong: Hahaha. Everyone's got their own opinion. That's great, that's great!
Xudong: If you don't mind, Traveler, could you help us catch a few of the crabs that live under that Thunder Sakura?
Xudong: If you do, I'll whip up a great feast for you as thanks.
Xudong: Ah, yes. Hang on... Take this bait.
Xudong: If you're going to catch crabs over there, use these to attract them first.
Xudong: It should save you some time and effort.
Xudong: Crabs that live near a Thunder Sakura. I wonder how they'll taste...
Traveler: Oh, we're talking about delicious food again, are we?

## Talk 2

Parvaneh: That book of mine says that if you touch the Thunder Sakura Bough, you won't be hit by any of those lightning bolts around the Thunder Sakura...
Parvaneh: But well, you've seen what that tree looks like. I'm not going to risk it based off such a rough summary of a solution.

## Talk 3

Xudong: Ah, Traveler! How goes the crab-catching harvest?
Xudong: Oho! This crab looks pretty good. You're a dab hand at this, aren't you?
Xudong: Well then, since we've got all our ingredients, let's begin cooking post-haste.
Xudong: Let me prepare for a while, Traveler. Please wait here.

## Talk 4

Xudong: Kourayaki... Why is it called Kourayaki, I wonder...
Xudong: Well, guess we'll make it first and ask questions later.
Xudong: Aha, here we go! "Crab Roe Kourayaki."
Julie: I'll have one! Mm-hmm, this is great!
Parvaneh: Give me one of the smaller ones. I doubt I'd be able to finish one that's too large...
Xudong: And this serving's for you, Traveler.
Xudong: Here, why don't you have a copy of the recipe, too?
Xudong: This dish shouldn't be too hard to make, so you can try it yourself if you like.
Xudong: We'll probably head for the vicinity of *Yashiori Island* next. Go look for us there, if you've got the time.
Xudong: Alright, time to grab a bite for myself, eh...
Xudong: Hey! Julie! Leave one for me!

## Talk 5

Parvaneh: Why do Electrograna have so many uses... how strange...
