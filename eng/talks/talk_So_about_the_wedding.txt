# Talk Dialog

Traveler: So, about the wedding...
Hiiragi Chisato: Kamaji and I talked it over afterward. He was very supportive of my current course of action.
Hiiragi Chisato: "I will wait for you, no matter how long it takes," he promised me. I must say that I was greatly relieved to hear that.
Hiiragi Chisato: The ceremonial matters may have been pushed back, yes, but I believe that our hearts grew closer together. That is of great comfort to me.
