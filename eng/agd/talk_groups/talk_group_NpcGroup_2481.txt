Traveler: More work to be done means more Mora to be made.
Wanhu: You're right! Staying positive is a good thing!
Wanhu: Sometimes, however, no amount of joy from money made can mask bodily pain and fatigue.
Wanhu: I hope everyone can strike a balance between making money and taking care of their health, especially those at my age...
Wanhu: If you let the vigor of youth blind you to the need for self-care and behave recklessly as a result... You'll pay the price once you're middle-aged!
Wanhu: I was stubborn in my youth. Not only did I neglect my posture while working, I drank and stayed up late all the time!
Wanhu: Now it's too late for regret!
Wanhu: Let me rest against this box for a while longer. With any luck, it'll alleviate the pain.

Traveler: Do you want to see a doctor?
Wanhu: True... That reminds me...
Wanhu: I got a prescription from Dr. Yiqing in Qiaoying Village once, and it alleviated the pain tremendously.
Wanhu: But according to the guys in the Secure Transport Agencies, I should seek help from Dr. Bai at Bubu Pharmacy if I want to be fully cured.
Wanhu: A guard once found himself with a bone-deep injury after losing to some monsters in the mountains, but it only took a few months for him to make a full recovery with Dr. Bai's medicine! It was like magic!
Wanhu: But it's an arduous journey from there to here for Dr. Bai's apprentice...
Wanhu: I think I'll just write a letter in advance. Once there are more patients here, she can deliver the medication in one go instead of suffering on my account!

Traveler: Perhaps we can use some kind of device for assistance...
Wanhu: Actually, it's already in use! See that huge lifting mechanism over there?
Wanhu: I heard the skilled artisans of Liyue have analyzed the characteristics of Fontaine's clockwork meka and are working on designing a smaller version that's suitable for use in Liyue.
Wanhu: Once the power source issue is resolved, they'll start rolling off the manufacturing line to help us with physical labor very soon.
Wanhu: According to what I heard during some drinking sessions... Hmm... How do I put it...
Wanhu: "Technology iterates rapidly"! Yes, that's it!
