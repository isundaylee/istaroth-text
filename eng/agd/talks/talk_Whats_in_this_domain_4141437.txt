Traveler: What's in this domain?
Plauen: This is a special domain that was discovered by the Adventurers' Guild some time ago. It seems to only turn up at specific times.
Plauen: There are quite a few interesting things going on inside. We've opened it to the public after some modification work.
Plauen: If you're interested, please feel free to attempt this challenge. Do it alone, or call your friends, either is fine!
Traveler: It's not dangerous in there, is it?
Plauen: Don't worry, we'll have seasoned adventurers accompanying you all the way if you bring people without any experience.
Plauen: But I think that a veteran such as you will be fine.
