# From Outer Lands


## Talk 1

Paimon: Oh, this seems to be a ship... Uh, well, more like half a ship...
Paimon: But what would half a ship be doing in a place like this? Oh, look! There are some words carved on it. Let's see what they say...
Paimon: "Though the front half was lost, we've somehow managed to stay afloat on the remaining back half for some time now... Now that's what I call a ship, haha! Unfortunately, most of the ship's load is probably sitting at the bottom of the sea by now..."
Paimon: "...It seems like... we floated here on the southeast currents? Well, that doesn't matter. The problem that we need to solve right now is how to leave this place..."
Paimon: Looks to Paimon like they were a group of people who were stranded at sea. It says the "front half was lost"...
Paimon: Oh, so that must mean this is the "remaining back half"! Whew, what could have possibly caused their ship to break into two like that?
Paimon: Hmm, it also said that they ended up here by floating on the "southeast currents."
Paimon: If we follow the way that they came and look for the front half of the ship, maybe we'll find something.
Traveler: Let's bring the carved wood plank we just read with us, too.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it. You think these carved words might be some sort of clue.
Paimon: Makes sense to Paimon! Most of the ship's wood has already started to rot, the carved plank will probably break right off.
Paimon: Alright, let's snap off that plank and go search for the other half of the ship!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Oh, this seems to be a ship... Uh, well, more like half a ship...
Paimon: But what would half a ship be doing in a place like this? Oh, look! There are some words carved on it. Let's see what they say...
Paimon: "We have no idea where we are, but it looks like we've left Inazuma far behind. Ha, I wish I could see the looks on the faces of those Shogunate lackeys!"
Paimon: "However, there doesn't appear to be a speck of dry land in sight. I'm afraid the boat won't hold up unless we find a place to make anchor soon... We need to think of a way soon."
Paimon: It seems the boat was full of people that left Inazuma, but then encountered some problems at sea... All they could do is drift with the currents.
Paimon: It seems that their boat was still intact at that time. Let's keep searching the area for more clues.
Traveler: Let's bring the carved wood plank we just read with us, too.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it. You think these carved words might be some sort of clue.
Paimon: Makes sense to Paimon! Most of the ship's wood has already started to rot, the carved plank will probably break right off.
Paimon: Alright, let's snap off that plank and go search for the other half of the ship!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Hey, this must be the other half of the ship. Let's see... Oh, there's some more words carved here!
Paimon: "We have no idea where we are, but it looks like we've left Inazuma far behind. Ha, I wish I could see the looks on the faces of those Shogunate lackeys!"
Paimon: "However, there doesn't appear to be a speck of dry land in sight. I'm afraid the boat won't hold up unless we find a place to make anchor soon... We need to think of a way soon."
Traveler: The words from each half of the ship are connected.
Paimon: If we place them together, it reads...
Paimon: "We have no idea where we are, but it looks like we've left Inazuma far behind. Ha, I wish I could see the looks on the faces of those Shogunate lackeys!"
Paimon: "However, there doesn't appear to be a speck of dry land in sight. I'm afraid the boat won't hold up unless we find a place to make anchor soon... We need to think of a way soon."

Paimon: "...It seems like... we floated here on the southeast currents? Well, that doesn't matter. The problem that we need to solve right now is how to leave this place..."
Paimon: Paimon gets it now. These people were transporting something on the boat when they encountered some trouble at sea and ended up drifting here.
Traveler: Seems like quite the disaster.
Paimon: No kidding, the boat even broke in half...
Paimon: Hmm, but the real question is... what were they carrying on the ship?
Paimon: Why don't we look around some more? *gasp* Maybe we'll find treasure!
Traveler: Anything that's been in the water that long is probably ruined by now.
Paimon: Hey! Don't dampen our treasure hunting spirit! I'm sure any treasure we find will be nice and shiny.
Paimon: Anyway, let's get moving. We've got a lot of sea to cover!
Traveler: Or more monsters...
Paimon: No way, we're at sea now! All we have out here is water and big fish.
Traveler: Maybe they found a way to survive the incident?
Paimon: Paimon sure hopes so... But the situation sounds like it was pretty dire...
