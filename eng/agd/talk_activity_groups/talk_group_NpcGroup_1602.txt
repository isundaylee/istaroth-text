Albert: Sorry! I was just leaving...
Albert: Oh, you're not a sister. Can I help?

## Talk

Traveler: Did you just say "Barbara-sama"?
Albert: Yes. Is there something you find strange about that?
Albert: Barbara-sama lights up my world. She is so adorable, so kind, so pure and innocent...
Albert: ...What's that look for? You think I'm making this up?
Albert: #You, sir, need to be baptized in the spirit!
Albert: ...By which I mean, you need to witness one of Barbara-sama's live performances!
Albert: Do you hear me? You must go and watch her performance! *sigh* You ignorant fool... You wouldn't recognize the grace of the gods if it slapped you in the face!

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing?
Albert: Nothing, just out for a stroll.
Albert: Because this is the closest I can get to Barbara-sama without disrupting her work at the Cathedral!
Albert: Can you smell the scent of honey in the air?
Albert: ...Um, do you want to join the Barbara Fan Club?
Albert: 'Cause if you do, you're in luck â€” I actually run it! Whether you want to show your support through fan activities or get up-to-date info on performance arrangements, once you're a member you can always find someone to point you in the right direction.
Albert: What do you reckon? Give it some thought!

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Albert: "Go Barbara, Go!"
Albert: Oh, you're still here? I wasn't being a weirdo, I was just practicing the chant we do at performances.

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Albert: Stormterror must have been moved by Barbara-sama's charisma, which returned it to its senses at last!
Albert: Barbara-sama's smile is like the dawn that breaks through the darkness. It is the star flashing through the night sky. Even Stormterror cannot withstand her loveliness!
Albert: If you cannot understand that, then you're part of the problem. You are not yet sufficiently enlightened!
Albert: Yes, this must be the truth! Go Barbara, Go!
