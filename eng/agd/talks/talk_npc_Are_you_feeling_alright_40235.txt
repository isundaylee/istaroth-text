Traveler: Are you feeling alright?
Stanley: Ah, I... I'm fine, don't worry.
Stanley: I just get sentimental sometimes on nights like this, as I listen to the din in the tavern.
Stanley: It brings me back to the days when I and Stanley had just started adventuring together. We'd always drink ourselves under the table the night before setting out.
Stanley: *sigh* It's alright. I'll get up. For his sake, I definitely will.
