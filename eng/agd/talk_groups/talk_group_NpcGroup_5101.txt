Traveler: Tell me about the opera house...
Gracie: The most magnificent building on Erinnyes is the Opera Epiclese. When we Fontainians speak of the "opera house," that's what we're normally referring to.
Gracie: It has another, more important role, besides serving as a site for various cultural performances.
Gracie: It is also a courtroom in which all cases in Fontaine are judged.
