Traveler: The trip was way too long!
Aeval: That's true... Feedback noted! I'll report it to the higher-ups!
Aeval: I've heard that Poisson is the hometown of the person who built the line, which is why the Clementine Line was made to pass through Mont Automnequi during the planning stages.
Aeval: Going through the mountain is super exciting â€” and that's why the Poisson Tunnel we went through was carved.
Aeval: But that choice does also make sense. The land over at Elynas is not very stable, and since the seabed at Elton Trench is unsuitable, we can't just come over the water either!
Aeval: So, all that is to say that changing the route might be a bit hard, so we could... make the boats faster? That way, we'd shorten travel time! Hmm, but what about explanation time...
