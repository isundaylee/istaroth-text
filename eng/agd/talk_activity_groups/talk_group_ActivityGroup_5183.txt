Valerina: Honorary Knight, Cat Whisperer Paimon, are you two tired? Would you like something to eat or drink? Or perhaps a massage to relax your muscles?
Traveler: Never mind that for now. Let's talk business...
Paimon: That's right! It can't have been cheap setting up this Furball Fortress. Even Paimon knows that...
Paimon: If there's a problem with the finances, don't hesitate to let us know and we'll figure something out!
Valerina: Ah, so that's what you were concerned about... Well, we've nothing to worry about as far as Mora is concerned.
Valerina: My parents are both merchants. Not super rich, but they do support me with "operational funds" each month, so running the Fortress is no big deal at all.
Valerina: I might look like a stiff breeze could blow me away, but I was the "riddle solver" in my adventuring team back when I was with the Adventurers' Guild.
Valerina: Quite often my entire team relied on my intelligence to overcome the strange mechanisms in the ruins and get us to the treasure.
Valerina: That's to say, I didn't come cheap if anyone wanted to hire me as a freelance adventurer. I used to take on quite a bit of work, too. Sometimes I'd even complete over ten missions in a month.
Valerina: In fact, the Mora I earned on my own has surpassed the "operational funds" my parents provide me with. At this point, I have enough to handle my daily expenses for a lifetime and then some.
Valerina: I don't really have any hobbies, and now the money that was just sitting in my savings is being used to help cats today, and tomorrow, it might help more animals still. That works out just as it should, don't you think?
Paimon: Wow, you're... certainly wealthy beyond Paimon's expectations... Hang on, what do you mean "That works out just as it should"?
Valerina: Hmm. How should I put this... I've been part of many adventuring teams in my time, and I've dealt with all sorts of animal-loving people and pets.
Valerina: I've also met some compassionate souls asking others... and even the Knights of Favonius or the Church to adopt stray animals.
Valerina: This, while they themselves don't have any money beyond that needed to support themselves.
Valerina: Some good souls with the means, on the other hand, donate enough Mora to take care of one or two stray cats. They're good role models.
Valerina: I mean, it's good to have sympathy, but I don't really like asking others to do things that they... well, aren't even responsible for in the first place, you know, just because of your own feelings.
Valerina: That's why solving this problem is a job for someone who's both willing and rich, like me — I'll pay, and I'll do my part!
Valerina: Of course, I'll stop bothering you two and Ms. Rosaria once I've learned how to get along with cats!
Paimon: Huh. Y'know what, Valerina? That's kinda cool! Paimon didn't know that you had this side to you.
Paimon: Those stray cats are real lucky to have met someone like you. Paimon sure hopes that the Furball Fortress will help more cats in the future!
Traveler: Well done indeed!
Valerina: Hahaha, such wonderful praise from the Honorary Knight and Cat Whisperer Paimon...! Ah, now I'm getting really pumped up again!
Valerina: I'll keep working at it. I will learn how to communicate with cats and manage the Fortress as best I can!
Traveler: A commendable spirit!
Traveler: Food and drinks?
Paimon: Huh, did you set up a kitchen in here, Valerina? Paimon hasn't seen one.
Paimon: And what about the chef? Or are you gonna step up to the plate?
Valerina: As you can see, while this place isn't officially open yet, some guests still stay here for long periods of time.
Valerina: And I wouldn't say making them go out and buy food and drinks themselves is an ideal situation.
Valerina: As such, I've set things up with Sara at Good Hunter so that if our guests have requests for takeout, they can leave them with me. Then, Ms. Rosaria or I will put the order in at Good Hunter.
Valerina: I'm not running this place to make a profit, so the prices for ordering takeout will be the same as getting it straight from the restaurant.
Paimon: W—Wait, you're not even charging them for the delivery fee?
Paimon: I'm sure our guests will be thrilled to be able enjoy delicious food at the original price while playing with cats!
Valerina: Right? Even you think it's a great idea, don't ya, Cat Whisperer?
Valerina: Once the Fortress officially opens, this can be one of its selling points!
Valerina: The more people we attract, the more likely the cats are to find a suitable owner. Once the number of visitors and the rate at which I adopt cats reaches a nice balance, I'll consider expanding the scale of our operations.
Valerina: Once that happens, we'll be able to add a management area, and areas in which other stray animals can be adopted...
Valerina: Though that's an issue I'll have to plan out in the future. Just leave the business operations and data gathering to me. Don't sweat that stuff!
Traveler: No worries, we know you're busy!
Valerina: Hah, not as busy as you, I expect! Why, I should watch the two of you work more if anything!

## Talk

Rosaria: Hmm? Not playing with the cats? Or do you have a takeout order for me to take care of?
Traveler: What do you think of this job?
Paimon: You don't seem to play with the cats much. Do you find this... boring?
Rosaria: It's alright. Boring and interesting are relative.
Rosaria: I don't anticipate any major incidents or accidents occurring here. It's a very ordinary job, little different from staying at the Church...
Rosaria: Hmm... No, there are some differences.
Rosaria: Some of these cats are very clever, and they understand me just fine. I find interacting with them interesting enough.
Rosaria: And even though Valerina is quite similar to Victoria in the way she finds things for me to do... They do have very different ways of doing things.
Rosaria: It's a fresh experience, I suppose, and that in itself is new. It's not a bad feeling.
Paimon: Well, that's great!
Paimon: Paimon thinks you get along pretty well with Valerina and the cats, really!
Traveler: You do indeed get along well.
Rosaria: Thank you, and I hope things stay that way.
Traveler: You'll be great buddies for sure.
Traveler: Which cat do you like the most?
Paimon: Paimon's curious, too! Have you ever found a cat you'd like to get close to, or wanted to take good care of?
Rosaria: That's rather sudden, but I suppose it's natural for people to be curious about things like that.
Rosaria: I would say "no."
Paimon: Wow. That was quick!
Traveler: That's a surprise...
Rosaria: Different people have their own definitions of the word "like."
Rosaria: To me, right now there's no living being or object I think of in those terms. That said, it's about the same for things I "dislike."
Rosaria: My willingness to care for these cats, to spend my time on them, is because it's my job...
Rosaria: Or should I say that it's a problem before me that requires little effort on my part to solve, so why not?
Rosaria: If nothing else, this job's presented me with some... pleasant surprises. I'd consider that good enough.
Paimon: Uh, Paimon didn't really get that, but it sounds... positive...?
Traveler: Don't worry, I didn't get it either.
Rosaria: Don't overthink it. Life's like a placid lake most of the time. You just need to get used to it.
Rosaria: And if you can't... I'm sure someone of your ability can change all you see before you. Good luck either way.
Traveler: No worries, Paimon, I'll understand Rosaria for the both of us.
Traveler: I knew it...
Traveler: I guess I'll leave you to it.
Rosaria: Sure. Come find me if you need anything else.

## Talk

Ematol: Oh, where are you, Sir Pouncelot? Where do I even start to look...
Traveler: Are you alright?
Ematol: H—Honorary Knight!
Ematol: H—Honorary Knight! I—I—I'm here to report that the squad cat I was charged with caring for... knocked me out and escaped...
Traveler: Squad Cat?
Ematol: Well, it's really embarrassing, and I could never let the Honorary Knight worry about me...
Ematol: And our captain's busy with debriefing reports at headquarters... so, I must find Sir Pouncelot on my own!
Traveler: Knocked you out?
Traveler: Are you sure you're alright?
Ematol: Y—Yes, yes I am! Thanks for your concern! I'm just a little woozy after eating a paw to the head...
Ematol: Sir Pouncelot didn't really hit me that hard, he was just a bit upset... It's all my fault for being too weak...
Ematol: I shouldn't have gotten it into my head to pour Phonia's powder on the toy before giving it to the cat...
Ematol: I just thought it smelled nice, you know? But Sir Pouncelot saw it as a threat and... Either way, I deserved the beating!
Ematol: In any case, it's best I picked up training again. I don't use normal weapons at the frontline, but even slinging bombs requires quite a bit of strength...
Ematol: It's okay if I can't take on a boar, but being knocked unconscious by a single swipe from a big cat... Let's just say that I'd fail the next combat skills assessment as I am now for sure. I must uphold my duty as a knight!
Ematol: Or perhaps... I could design a bomb-firing device with a caliber exceeding the launch tube width based on Liyue's explosives and Fontaine's muskets?
Ematol: *ahem* Well, no matter what, that's a job for later...
Ematol: And e—either way, this was all my fault. I—I can't trouble you with it, Honorary Knight, no way! You're basically Captain-tier, after all! I'm sure you have lots of more important things to do!
Ematol: Well, I shan't bother you, then.
Traveler: Well, I'm not sure just what you're going through... but good luck regardless!
Ematol: #Y—Yes, Honorary Knight, sir! I—I'll do my best! Yeah! My best!

## Talk

Oz: It is rare to have such leisure time. I wonder if Mein Fräulein is also enjoying herself...
Traveler: (Oz seems to be resting. Best not to disturb him...)

## Talk

Mona: Hmm... Well, I do find inspiration sometimes when I play with the cats.
Mona: But as I do, I find my motivation to write waning... On the other end, you're always raring to go every time I see you. It's almost as if you're simply inexhaustible!
Traveler: Hold on, we're not workaholics either!
Paimon: Yeah! We're always traveling, so we don't do too much exhausting work.
Mona: #But when I dropped by The Steambird before to take care of some things, I noticed an editor compiling mountains of notes. Hundreds were related to "a Blond Traveler."
Mona: Destroying the Pufferfruit floating here and there, defeating monsters and bandits up and down the land, escorting masterless cargo through dangerous areas...
Mona: And every seven days, taking care of commissions from ordinary citizens, sometimes completing dangerous bounties...
Mona: Your weekly workload is practically fourteen to seventy times that of some elite adventurers! Some people even ask for star readings to predict when you'll arrive, just so they can hire you!
Paimon: Huh? So, we... Are we actually that hardworking... and popular?
Mona: If you could apply that same industriousness to helping me write articles... I mean, I would provide a detailed summary and the underlying theoretical basis, and you would just help me put it to paper...
Mona: We could probably publish hundreds of papers in a year... No, we'd be able to publish a slew of books with tons of time to spare!
Traveler: Great! And what would my cut be?
Paimon: Paimon's not sure you get paid all that much for your writing anyway... Would there be enough left if we split the proceeds...?
Mona: We'd split it down the middle regardless of the amount, of course! With my brains and your tireless toil, it would be a completely fair arrangement! The more we write, the more we'll sell and the greater the readership. The income will naturally grow substantially!
Mona: Oh, I've prepared a whole bunch of theses! So many that I'd not run out of material even if I proceeded at an ideal pace for several years! I'll wager that plenty of those articles will end up being cited and utilized by the academic community — and oh, those licensing fees will be glorious!
Mona: Anyway, if you are willing, then we can discuss the details once I've finished preparations.
Mona: Who knows? Perhaps we'll become an ace astrology arrangement with the highest proportion of thesis contributions!
Traveler: My handwriting isn't exactly the prettiest...
Paimon: Now that you mention it, compared to professional authors, Paimon's handwriting is also... Well, not the best, and not very fast either.
Mona: That's fine. I can buy a typewriter from Fontaine, and it's not like articles printed in newspapers use our original handwriting!
Mona: And they write quite elegantly indeed, but a typewriter that would fit the title of "the Great Astrologist" would be hard to find... Still, I'm sure I can purchase one if I search hard enough!
Traveler: Are the manuscripts being difficult lately?
Mona: "Difficult" is not the phrasing I'd use. "Not ideal in quality," perhaps. Though the results of my astrological observations are crystal clear, and my mind is equally sure about how it wants to convey them, I just can't put quill to paper.
Mona: If I were to put out something wishy-washy under these circumstances, the quality would not be worthy of the name of Mona Megistus, the Astrologist!
Paimon: Ah, so it's not just "burnout," but the high expectations you have for yourself...
Mona: Yes, and it was at such a moment that I happened to hear about the trial opening of the Furball Fortress, and thought I'd come and try relaxing a bit here. You know, get myself back in the right state of mind.
Mona: But after playing with the cats, I found that I was... too relaxed, while the study of the stars and penning papers requires a certain seriousness...
Paimon: That's totally normal! Maybe you just haven't played enough! If you cut playtime short and force yourself to work, it's no surprise that you won't be able to focus!
Paimon: Just don't think about anything, empty your head completely, and just take a nap when you tire yourself out from playing! You'll definitely be full of energy and enthusiasm the next day!
Traveler: That would be ideal, anyway...
Mona: You do have a point, Paimon, which does fit with another possibility — which is that the current course of fate has yet to come into contact with some key factor.
Mona: Deadlines are fixed, but days suited to important work are flexible. We must wait for the crucial sign...
Mona: But for now, I shall follow your advice and stop thinking. I'll continue enjoying myself here in the Furball Fortress. Who knows? The sign that I should pick up my pen just might come tomorrow...
Mona: #Thanks, Traveler! And you too, Paimon!
Traveler: But what if you still just wanna have fun...
Traveler: We'll talk again later!
Mona: Yes, it looks like you still have work to do. I shan't take up any more of your time, then.

## Talk

Razor: Seeing lupical, I am happy.
Traveler: Razor, are you acquainted with Dustball?
Razor: It, sleeps outside city wall. Takes me there. Very comfy.
Razor: It has many friends, many, outside city... starving...
Razor: Inside the city, there's food... Me, hunting, there's food.
Paimon: Oh, so you already made friends with Dustball outside the city...
Traveler: Sounds like you do have quite a few friends out there.
Paimon: Then, they deliver the food out to their friends outside...
Paimon: Why don't those little cats just come inside the city? Sure, the walls might be a little high, but there's shelter from the wind and rain and plenty to eat!
Razor: They like, butterflies flying high. They don't like, places without wind.
Razor: ...Dustball different. Like people more.
Razor: He wants to give food to friends. His friends like human food.
Paimon: They like human food, but don't want to live in the city. Those are some pretty fickle cats!
Razor: He wants to bring friends, inside. Use food, bring them inside.
Traveler: Convincing cats to come inside with food...
Paimon: But if we bring all those cats over here from outside, will the Furball Fortress be able to handle it?
Paimon: If this place was really filled to the brim with all kinds of cats, Valerina would be really happy, but the funds might...
Razor: Cats good, food good, hungry, bad. I will help!
Traveler: Anyway, we should make sure that the cats are fed first.
Paimon: Yeah, no matter what, we should take care of delivering the food before anything else. If only we could convince them to come live in the city...
Traveler: And we need to explain things to Valerina...
Paimon: That's right, after all, the costs of running this Furball Fortress are all coming right out of her pocket.
Traveler: Razor, how are the cats outside the city doing right now?
Razor: Past few days, brought food to friends. Now, they not hungry.
Paimon: Phew... That's a relief. Now that we don't have to worry about the cats suffering from hunger pangs while we speak, we can go discuss this with Valerina...
Razor: Thank you, Lupical. When with you, no need to worry.
Traveler: That actually might do the trick...
Traveler: It feels like you already knew each other.

## Talk

Fischl: No need to tremble before the Prinzessin. You have done well indeed to care for these cat familiars... flawlessly, even! Keep up the fine work!
Fischl: As the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, I shall remain here for a bit longer... Reading the poetry of the soul of these feline familiars.
Traveler: Your Royal Highness the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, how proceedeth thy reading?
Paimon: Yeah! Paimon's curious too. How're you getting along with the cats? Did you find any special ones?
Fischl: ...Hmph!
Fischl: It has been just a few short days, merely a snap of the fingers, however, and our promising feline retainers are yet deep in preparation to display their prodigious capabilities before my royal person.
Fischl: Only this creature with a name most humble, as though it was seeking to actively conceal its unique talents, this "Dopey," has dared to respond to my tests, and has proven relatively cooperative. Praiseworthy indeed!
Paimon: Wait... So the other cats just gave you the cold shoulder because they couldn't understand your... unique way of speaking...?
Paimon: And only "Dopey" is usually willing to spend time with you?
Traveler: Blasphemous slander! How could that be?
Fischl: *ahem*... Such topics are unworthy of further examination!
Fischl: Cat Conjurors, the time has come for you to demonstrate your wisdom and offer up your counsel to mine august person...
Fischl: I am sure that by this time, you have long since gained deep insight into... All the habits and favorite victuals fancied by the feline familiars here within the Furball Fortress.
Paimon: Oh, so you just wanted to ask what the cats like to eat! That's an easy one.
Paimon: You sure are a quick study! The moment you noticed the cats ignoring you, you immediately thought of using food to get close to them...
Traveler: A classic stratagem!
Black Screen Text: You describe the food preferences of several cats to Fischl, and based on Paimon's suggestions, come up with a few combinations that might make them especially happy...
Fischl: As expected! Such an intricate formulation could surely only be mastered by you, my Cat Conjurors most clever!
Fischl: To discern the potential of each of these feline retainers, I, the Prinzessin, must also reveal a suitable skill amongst my talents unnumbered, and show these cats the world...
Paimon: Hehe, good luck, Fischl!
Paimon: Though remember to exercise portion control! Even if it's their favorite foods, cats can't eat too much! Don't let them pig out or waste food!
Traveler: Paimon...
Paimon: H—H—Hey... Why are you looking at Paimon like that? P—Paimon always orders what she likes and finishes every morsel! She would never waste a crumb!
Paimon: A—At least, Paimon doesn't think she's ever wasted anything...? As for pigging out...
Paimon: Paimon may sometimes eat a bit more than usual, but that can't really count as pigging out!
Traveler: (Stare...)
Traveler: Most wise, Mein Prinzessin!
Traveler: Not surprising...
Traveler: How has Oz been lately?
Paimon: Oh, right! What's Oz been up to while you've been playing in the Furball Fortress? Is he just... waiting by the door?
Paimon: Or did he go outside the city by himself? Could that be dangerous for him?
Fischl: Oho! Do not jest! This is Oz we speak of! Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, the being who reigns supreme over three universes!
Fischl: Surely, you are not concerned for his safety? Hardly necessary, I do say! Even at a hundred paces, a thousand paces, any harboring treacherous intent would be overwhelmed and over-awed by the mysterious depths of his gaze, and would never dare to act rashly!
Fischl: In our journey through the ages, it is inevitable that Oz and I will sometimes act separately.
Fischl: When Oz is not at his place by my side, he prefers peace and quiet, and will actively conceal his person rather than chat with mortals.
Fischl: Simply by observing the placid surface of a lake, Oz can sift through millions upon millions of memories, and from them, allow entirely new philosophies yet undreamt of to bubble up... This is one of his favorite pastimes.
Paimon: Paimon thinks she gets it... He should be by Cider Lake right now... Somewhere we can't see, resting and enjoying the breeze.
Paimon: So you get to have fun in the Furball Fortress, while Oz gets to treat himself, resting the way he likes. Seems like good deal for all!
Traveler: Very good indeed!
Fischl: Naturally, I, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, cannot long linger here in this "Furball Fortress," for the pressing matters of many different worlds await the attention of Oz and myself...
Fischl: The next time I see you two, my good Cat Conjurors, I shall surely have sought out a... cat familiar who fears not Oz's might and majesty!
Traveler: Congratulations are in order!
Traveler: Then we shall continue to dedicate ourselves to the cause!
Fischl: Most excellent indeed! The cat familiars all applaud your amazing work!

## Talk

Amber: Hey, you two! You're doing such a great job managing this place! I never imagined you'd be so good at this too!
Traveler: As long as you're enjoying yourself, Amber!
Paimon: That's right! Valerina also orders food from Good Hunter, so Amber, you can stay here and play when you're on vacation!
Paimon: Oh! Speaking of work, have you finished all your recent missions, Amber? When you were asking Bunny about the weather... Was it because you have to go out on gliding patrol soon?
Amber: Relax, no need to worry! I won't be going out on patrol today. I was just asking Bunny about the weather to make conversation, that's all!
Amber: I'm here today for two reasons! First, to satisfy my own curiosity, and second, to help a friend...
Amber: I have a friend who's very skilled at making handicrafts, and used to make all kinds of toys for kitties and doggies. Many of the furnishings at The Cat's Tail were made by her!
Amber: After I heard about the Furball Fortress, she contacted Valerina, and supplied some furniture and toys — the very same ones you see here, in fact!
Amber: What I didn't imagine was that Valerina couldn't bear to accept donations, and insisted on paying her.
Amber: Now that the Fortress is a few days into its trial opening, my friend wants to understand whether or not the cats like her toys, but she doesn't really have time, and she doesn't understand cats very well either...
Amber: So I'm here to conduct an on-the-spot inspection! And the results are in. Full marks!
Paimon: If even the person making cat toys can't communicate with them, how'd you manage it, Amber?
Traveler: Natural talent?
Amber: #I don't know either... Maybe you're right, Traveler — those do both sound like good reasons. But maybe there's another, and that's my duties as an Outrider?
Amber: Outriders are different from scouts, who need to both quickly obtain intelligence on the enemy, but also strike first. Outriders need to do their best to stay out of sight and use every means at their disposal to gather intel.
Amber: Sometimes, the chirping of birds, the bouncing of squirrels, and the grunting of boars can tell me what I need to know about monsters.
Amber: If I'm lucky, animals that are familiar with me will come up and warn me of monsters of their own accord when they see me in areas I often patrol.
Amber: Whether they do it by chirping, bouncing, or grunting, they all mean pretty much the same thing: "Oooh, scary! There's bad guys over there!"
Amber: Compared to those sensitive wild animals, the cats outside are really easy to communicate with, never mind these super well-behaved little kitties in the Furball Fortress!
Paimon: P—Paimon never imagined that Outriders would have to master skills like those... If it was Paimon, she'd probably get dizzy just trying to listen for a little while!
Amber: Oh, it's not some essential skill! It's just something I've picked up from my experiences. For an Outrider, the most important skill to master is using a wind glider.
Amber: #On that note, Traveler, your wind glider skills haven't gotten rusty in your long absence from Mondstadt, have they?
Traveler: Would you like to test me personally, Instructor Amber?
Amber: Now that's the spirit! That's what I like to see!
Amber: The next time we meet, I'll be sure to give you a real test!
Amber: If your skills really are even sharper than before, then I'll personally make you some Sticky Honey Roast!
Paimon: Yay! Amber's Sticky Honey Roast!
Paimon: #Let's find a time to practice a bit more soon, Traveler! You've gotta make sure you can back your boasts up!
Traveler: My gliding skills soar upward by the second!
Traveler: You practiced with Baron Bunny?
Traveler: What kind of cats do you like, Amber?
Amber: Me? I'm not really sure myself...
Amber: Each cat is cute in its own way, so it's really hard to compare...
Paimon: That's true! Fur color, build, fur patterns, eyes, ears... There are combinations of characteristics beyond count! If Paimon had to choose, she wouldn't be able to pick either...
Amber: Though when you put it that way, I don't think I've ever seen a red cat...
Traveler: A red cat?
Paimon: If there really were red cats, Paimon bets they'd be super energetic and wreck the whole house if they got upset...
Amber: Well, Teyvat's a big place! You can find all manner of amazing and mysterious things here.
Amber: Just think about it— There are slimes of all different elements and colors, so maybe there are cats with all sorts of fantastic and exotic colors in some place we've never heard of...
Amber: Yeah! Y'know, the Grand Master's really experienced and knowledgeable, so maybe he's seen some during his travels!
Amber: Once he comes back, let's find an opportunity to sit down and talk together — we can ask him then!
Traveler: A Pyro Kitty!
Traveler: Thanks for the compliments! We'll keep at it!
Amber: Yeah! But don't forget to rest. Try not to tire yourself and Paimon out!
