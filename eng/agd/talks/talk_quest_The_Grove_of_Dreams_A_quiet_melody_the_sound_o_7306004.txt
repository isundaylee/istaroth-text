Arakunti: The Grove of Dreams... A quiet melody, the sound of the water, the sound of birds flapping their wings, the sound of stepping onto a branch...
Arakunti: Talking to Nara and Paimon... Paimon is fun. Sadly, Paimon doesn't want to become a seed.
Arapandu: That's because Paimon isn't an Aranara.
Arapandu: The Grove of Dreams is fine now. Arabalika is in the Ruins of Dahri, but Arapandu's not worried. However, there's lots of Fungi at the Yasna Monument. Arapandu's worried about Aranakula...
