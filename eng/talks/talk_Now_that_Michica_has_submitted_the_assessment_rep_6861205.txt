Couriers' Announcement: "As per usual, before finalizing the bidding requirements, we will first gather feedback from the couriers. We encourage you all to share your thoughtsâ€”"
Couriers' Announcement: "Let us know which parts of the protective gear are more prone to damage, where screws tend to fall out, and which materials are less resistant to corrosion from moisture and Gaseous Phlogiston... Also, which safety ropes have poor weight-to-durability ratios. The more detailed the feedback, the better."
Couriers' Announcement: "We are well aware that the current usage rate of the standard issue gear is not very high, so we are determined to improve it to ensure that the management fees you all contribute are put to better use!"
