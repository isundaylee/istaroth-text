I always believed we would see each other again
That our days of separation would finally end
And all my troubles would be behind me...
If only things could stay this way forever...
...A nightmare?
Curious... If you're relaxed, shouldn't your dreams be pleasant?
It was a good dream. It's just...
You weren't ready to wake up
Eloquent as one may be, words of comfort are not one's strong suit
You are doing all you can
One can see your strength of will, your fearlessness in the face of danger
And so, whatever your dream may be
One believes that... you shall achieve it
Of course, whenever the perils you face overwhelm you
Or you become weary, one is always here for you
After all... As an elder, it is only right to look out for the young ones
