# Talk Dialog

Twilight Theater Head: *sob, sniff* ... The show was a resounding success...
Twilight Theater Head: #Our thanks to all of the actors and actresses, and our thanks to everyone who came to support us! Of course, we must thank you as well, Traveler and Paimon!
Twilight Theater Head: I really appreciated your undivided attention... *sob*... It felt just like the relentlessly piercing gaze of the evil dragon...
Traveler (Paimon): About the title though...
Twilight Theater Head: Oh yes, the title is 'Tale of the Sword-Wielding Princess'!
Traveler: But she only wielded the sword for a brief moment towards the end?
Twilight Theater Head: Well... It's just like how The Five Kasen are usually portrayed in four poems...
Traveler: And like how we also call the best travel buddy "emergency food"...
Twilight Theater Head: Well, anyway, the important thing is not the sword in the hand, but the courage in the heart!
Twilight Theater Head: #Back to business! Now that the curtains have closed, I would like to take this rare opportunity to invite Traveler and Paimon to take a photo with the crew!
Twilight Theater Head: Please don't refuse! Come on!
Traveler: And like how we have a cavalry captain without a single horse...
