Traveler: It would seem that your writing isn't going too well...
"Bellringer": Well, it wasn't, which was why I holed up in this little town, where most people wouldn't find me.
"Bellringer": But I had a dream two days ago, one that had a grand, glorious ancient civilization as its stage â€” like an epic opera.
"Bellringer": As such, I plan to write about a young adventurer who discovers an ancient underwater civilization while in pursuit of an enigmatic red gem.
"Bellringer": Haha, perhaps we shall simply call it "The Ruby Riddle."
