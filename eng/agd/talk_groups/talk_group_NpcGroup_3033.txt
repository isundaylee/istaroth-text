Junkichi: Ugh, this deadline... There's no way I'll make it.
Junkichi: How about I just do a short story in a parallel universe, just to get something in for the festival, and then we can talk?
Shigeru: What? A parallel universe? Will the characters still be the same ones?
Junkichi: Well yes... and not entirely, no...
Junkichi: I mean, if we create a new world setting, then we don't have to consider the original narrative. We'll be free to innovate! This'll be done in no time!
Shigeru: ...Please don't do this. That's no different from the author writing fan fiction for himself!
Shigeru: Adding features and plot devices on for this reason will ruin all the content that we've built up so far. It's not worth it!
Junkichi: Come on, can't we...? Then I guess we've just got to prepare for the eventuality that I won't finish the manuscript.

## Talk 1

Junkichi: ...And at that moment, klang! Time stops!
Shigeru: Wait, stop...
Junkichi: Exactly! Time stops, and then...
Shigeru: No, I mean "stop." I didn't mean "stopping time"...
Junkichi: Oh, you don't think a time-stop will do? What about invisibility? That sounds good too.
Shigeru: Argh, just listen here, you!
Junkichi: Huh?
Shigeru: Doesn't this character already have a boatload of super powers? If we add another, it will ruin the whole thing!
Junkichi: But...
Shigeru: No buts! Think, man, think!
Junkichi: Okay, okay... Aaand poof, there goes my inspiration all of a sudden.
Junkichi: I mean, come on, my gut tells me that we should give him the ability to stop time right here!
Junkichi: Why don't you think this over, instead?
Shigeru: Ugh, this is so exhausting...

## Talk 2

Junkichi: ...So this is the structure I have in mind this time.
Junkichi: The supremely-skilled ninja uses all sorts of abilities to infiltrate the enemy fortress and retrieve the required intel in secret...
Shigeru: *sigh* And how many "abilities" are you going to give this ninja this time?
Junkichi: Th—That, uh, might depend on the situation?
Shigeru: Right. So you haven't thought about it, then.
Junkichi: I mean, it's fine! I mean, if you lock down all the narrative devices ahead of time, there's nowhere to adapt from there, right?
Shigeru: Oh, here you go again. If you had these devices locked in beforehand, your writing wouldn't go all over the shop!
Junkichi: I—I have my own creative methods, alright? The story should put its narrative first. How can it be shackled by these devices?
Shigeru: That's just irresponsible, you...
Traveler: What are you two arguing about?
Junkichi: Oh, its you! I was just thinking about to structure a novel about a ninja.
Junkichi: But Shigeru's criticizing the structures that I came up with again...
Shigeru: I'm not saying that what you've come up with is bad, per se. I'm just asking you to put your narrative devices in place first before you start writing...
Junkichi: No, no... I'm not going to list them all down and structure the narrative around them. That's just too staid!
Junkichi: The narrative is the most important thing in the novel, which everything else revolves around, even the setting and narrative devices...
Shigeru: You...
Junkichi: I...
Traveler: Alright, cut it out.
Shigeru: Forget it, you're not going to listen to me anyway...
Junkichi: I'm sticking to my creative principles no matter what you say.
Shigeru: *sigh* ...You know what, Traveler? Since you're here, why don't you be the judge?
Traveler: And how am I supposed to judge...
Shigeru: Uh, no, you just need to listen to Junkichi tell us the structure of this new narrative passage he's dreamed up.
Shigeru: After that, just use your judgment and think about how his ninja would act.
Shigeru: That way, Junkichi should get the feedback he needs about what happens when he just writes his story willy-nilly.
Junkichi: Hmph, sure. Well, Traveler, we're counting on you.
Junkichi: I'll narrate the story for you. Just act according to what you think is natural.
Junkichi: Let's show Shigeru how awesome a story unbound by these... narrative devices can be!
Shigeru: You...
Junkichi: I...
Traveler: Let's just start...
Junkichi: Well, let's begin, Traveler.
Junkichi: So, as I was writing, this ninja is entering the enemy fortress solo, preparing to steal critical intelligence.
Junkichi: Hehe, Traveler, are you ready to play the stealthy ninja?
Junkichi: Having made all the necessary preparations, the ninja infiltrates the fortress stealthily...
Traveler: This creativity business sure is tiring...
Traveler: Am I supposed to read his novel right here and now?
Traveler: Let's call a halt to this real quick, shall we?
