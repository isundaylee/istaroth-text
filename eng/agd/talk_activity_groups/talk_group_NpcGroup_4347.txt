## Talk

Hayyan: If I head left from here...

## Talk

Traveler: You are...
Hayyan: I'm a researcher conducting observations of Avidya Forest's ecology, and that is my bodyguard. We're not suspicious people, so please don't be too wary of us.
Hayyan: The Withering seems to be spreading lately, but there hasn't been much of a change in Avidya Forest's ecology. I guess the Forest Rangers have been working really hard.

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Hayyan: See you, it's best to plan out your route in advance before traveling through the forest.

## Talk

Traveler: About the rainforest...
Hayyan: If you know Sumeru, you'd know that this is just the easternmost area of it.
Hayyan: If you pass Caravan Ribat and go further west, you'll find yourself before an endless desert.
Hayyan: It's said that a very, very long time ago, Sumeru was a paradise covered in green, and the desert is the result of a disaster.

## Talk

Traveler: About The Withering...
Hayyan: The Withering... is the result of contamination.
Hayyan: If its source cannot be eradicated, then it will never end.
Hayyan: But the contamination of Irminsul is not so easily resolved, is it?
Hayyan: We can only trouble the Forest Rangers until a fundamental solution is found.

Traveler: You are...
Hayyan: I'm a researcher conducting observations of Avidya Forest's ecology, and that is my bodyguard. We're not suspicious people, so please don't be too wary of us.
Hayyan: The Withering has been in full retreat of late, and though traces of it still remain, the forest is now in a much better state than before.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me more about The Withering, if you don't mind.
Hayyan: As far as I've observed, no new taint has emerged within the rainforest. Even the preexisting Withering Zones are no longer expanding.
Hayyan: This is a good sign. That means that the forest is no longer being assailed by new impurities.
Hayyan: I believe that we researchers will make new strides in our research into Irminsul under Lesser Lord Kusanali's guidance.
