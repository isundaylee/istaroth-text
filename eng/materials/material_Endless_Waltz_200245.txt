# Endless Waltz

After using an Elemental Burst, all party members on the field will unleash one shockwave that scales on 600% of the ATK of the character that unleashed that shockwave, and which deals DMG to nearby opponents. This effect can occur once every 2s and its CD is shared between all characters in the party.
