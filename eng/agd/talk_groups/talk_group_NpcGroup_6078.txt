Pakaa Nui: Welcome, oh lover of music!

## Talk

Traveler: What's this establishment?
Pakaa Nui: Xochicuicatl Records is the name! My cousin Haloa came up with it. Pretty romantic, if I should say so!
Pakaa Nui: As the name suggests, we sell music records at base, and we also provide production and distribution services.
Pakaa Nui: If anyone's written some music but can't get it from paper to record, we'll represent them, from production to publishing.
Pakaa Nui: See that over there? That's a collection of classics by a famous writer of kids' songs. One of our bestsellers!

Traveler: I'll go have a look myself.
Pakaa Nui: Feel free!

Traveler: I take it that's what they call "business expansion"?
Pakaa Nui: Ah, you've got a head for this.
Pakaa Nui: I know some real music fanatics, including a records artisan from the Children of Echoes, and graffiti artists from the Masters of the Night-Wind.
Pakaa Nui: That way, we not only help release records but aid in packaging and promotion as well.
Pakaa Nui: Good, comprehensive service, wouldn't you say?

## Talk

Traveler: You have a sharp mind for business.
Pakaa Nui: Haha, well, a store whose objective is to do its utmost to satisfy the customer's needs can't do too badly, right?
Pakaa Nui: I haven't been in business for long, of course — just talking generally about my experience in the art of Mora-making.
