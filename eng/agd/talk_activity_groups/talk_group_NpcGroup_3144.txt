## Talk

Koyama: That bridge over there seems way too high up. Will it really be okay...

## Talk

Traveler: What's the matter?
Koyama: The matter with me? Uh... I'm fine right now, actually. I mean, I haven't crossed that bridge yet!
Koyama: Ah, stable ground is the best ground after all...

## Talk

Traveler: Seeya.
Koyama: See you. Just, ah, remember to be careful walking up there, alright?

## Talk

Traveler: Are you afraid of heights, by any chance?
Koyama: Um, heh, so you realized...
Koyama: I'm a Sangonomiya soldier, and in the past, my work always had to do with normal patrols and other duties, so I was fine.
Koyama: But as we started dispatching more troops out, I ended up having to guard this road to Sangonomiya Shrine.
Koyama: I couldn't muster up the courage to say that I was afraid of heights, so I just came here anyway. I thought I could take it...
Koyama: But when I got here... I mean, just look at that! It's so high up! I... I can't even take a step further, never mind guard this place!
Koyama: Oh, if only work was as simple as before... I just had to tail outsiders and stuff, you know?

## Talk

Traveler: Tail?
Koyama: Ah? Uh, well, that was some time ago.
Koyama: Someone from the Tenryou Commission came here, but instead of looking for Her Excellency or General Gorou, he went walking around the island instead.
Koyama: Her Excellency couldn't figure out what he wanted, so she sent a few of us to follow him, in case he tried anything untoward.
Koyama: Turns out that he didn't really do any investigating at all. He just happened to be on a stroll in his uniform.
Koyama: He even called himself a detective or something. Are all detectives as weird as him?
