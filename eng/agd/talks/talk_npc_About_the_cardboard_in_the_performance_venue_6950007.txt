Traveler: About the cardboard in the performance venue...
Wolfy: That moment when you first step onto the stage, do you not feel anything different at all? Do you not feel the unique ambiance within the magic ring?
Wolfy: *sigh*... This is one thing even one such as I, the concierge, cannot help you with...
Wolfy: It is only when guests "believe" from the bottom of their hearts that it's all real that the doors to that special world open wide before them.
Wolfy: When that happens, dear guest, you will understand that performing is a game, but also a ceremony, and thus does it too possess the power of magic!
