Traveler: Is it really alright if I don't buy anything?
Echuah: Of course, no problem at all. After all, what better advertisement could I ask for than having people being willing to hang around in front of my stall?
Echuah: Thanks to this, I've also met quite a few colorful characters.
Echuah: I remember one cool customer from Fontaine who wore sunglasses and a little anchor on his hat. He left quite the impression.
Echuah: He didn't say much, but he was very curious about Natlan's Ancient Names. He listened to me rabbit on about them for quite some time.
Echuah: I'm sorry to say that I've completely forgotten everything I said then... Perhaps some of it wasn't particularly accurate either, haha.
