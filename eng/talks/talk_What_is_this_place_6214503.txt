Traveler: What is this place?
Ekaterina: When it comes to interest rates, whether it be for loans and deposits, you will find no other bank more satisfactory than us in all of Liyue...
Ekaterina: Of course, should you take a loan from us, do remember to service that loan on time.
Ekaterina: I advise you to not take us to be an ordinary bank. We will not have debts go unpaid.
Ekaterina: Let me put it this way: have you seen an iceberg? You can only see what floats above the surface. No one can know what lies beneath.
Ekaterina: Understand this well, and it will go well with you when you do business with us. *chuckles*
Traveler: As for you and the Fatui...
Ekaterina: Do you mean to ask about our relationship with the Fatui? I apologize, but I cannot speak of such secrets.
Ekaterina: What I can tell you is that the Fatui Harbingers are key clients of ours.
Ekaterina: Just as an example, the number of zeroes behind the amount of money that one such as Master Childe has deposited in our coffers would be enough to boggle the mind.
Ekaterina: But to ones such as the Harbingers, money is but a number. If they should want anything, I fear there is little to stop them from obtaining it.
