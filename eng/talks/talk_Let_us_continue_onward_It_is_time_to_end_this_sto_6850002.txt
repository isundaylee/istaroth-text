Monsieur Os: Let us continue onward. It is time to end this story of the "past."
Traveler: So, what's the deal with you and Este...
Monsieur Os: As you have seen, he was a friend of mine, and one of the survivors of Remuria's destruction.
Monsieur Os: In later days, he followed me into the newborn Fontaine and was laid to rest there.
Monsieur Os: The spring waters responded to us, who were entrapped in rock, just as it did ordinary Fontainians, and he had children of his own, building a family there...
Monsieur Os: His bloodline became joined to that of Fontaine, and all came to forget that he was no ordinary mortal.
Monsieur Os: A good fate, no?
Traveler: (Pet him.)
Traveler: It's nothing.
Monsieur Os: Alright. If there is anything you wish to know, do not hesitate to ask me.
