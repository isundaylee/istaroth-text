A magician's greatest skill
Is making things disappear
Or appear
The possibilities are endless
But this isn't what you came for
These little tricks? You've seen them all before
So it's time for something truly extraordinary
Don't you think?
This one's a little tricky
Using this water tank
I shall make my sister vanish completely
Right before your very eyes
It's actually quite simple
She'll just turn into air bubbles
And float right out of the top...
Oh no
I told them to check all the props carefully
With the lid on
Even air can't escape...
An amateur magician would be getting
Very nervous right around now
Hehe
Luckily it's me on stage!
So let me show you what a true virtuoso can do
Lynette
Are you still there?
Don't go too far
We don't wanna use up all our magic
Hi
I'm back
