(Quest is part of chapter: Aranyaka: Part II Dream Nursery)

# The Rhythm that Leads to the Gloomy Path


## Talk 1

Paimon: So this is...
Arama: Yes. This is a Vasoma Fruit.
Arama: It is the accumulation of the dreams and memories gathered by the Vasara Tree. It's a precious fruit that can help us restore our strength.
Arama: A large amount of energy must be consumed for the Ashvattha Tree to produce a Bija. That is why we must offer Vasoma Fruits.
Arama: #Keep the Vasoma Fruit safe, Nara Traveler!
Paimon: Hmm. You know what? Let's teach Arama the meaning of "treasure"!
Paimon: Now then! "Treasure" refers to something very precious. This Vasoma Fruit contains lots of dreams and memories, and it can restore an Aranara's power. That makes it pretty rare and amazing, right?
Paimon: For things like Vasoma Fruits that are rare and precious, we call them "treasure"!
Arama: Ah, so this is what treasure means... I got it! Thank you, Paimon!
Traveler: So, what's next?
Paimon: Hmm... Araja said that we'll need more than one Vasoma Fruit. That means we need to find other Ashvattha's Concourses, right?
Arama: #That's right. I'll do my best to find them! So long, Nara Traveler and Paimon!
Paimon: See you later, Arama!
Traveler: Thank you, Paimon!
Paimon: What are you thanking Paimon for...? Anyway, Araja said that we'll need more than one Vasoma Fruit. That means we need to find other Ashvattha's Concourses, right?

## Talk 2

Paimon: We meet again, Arama!
Arama: #Ooh! Nara Traveler and Paimon! Hello!
Arama: Right, this is Arayasa. We met here when we were looking for Ashvattha's Concourses.
Paimon: Hello, Arayasa!
Traveler: Hello!
Arayasa: #"The next song is a poem about a young woman in search of the thing most dear to her. At the journey's beginning, her eyes were amber, without a hint of gloom..."
Paimon: ...?
Traveler: That's a little odd...
Arama: Yes. Arayasa is one of the "song gatherers" who collect songs of all kinds. He is the boldest of them all, and often learns Nara songs.
Arayasa: "Our destinies were like pearls born in the same hour..."
Traveler: We're not getting through at all...
Paimon: Uh, let's get back to the point, shall we? So, is this one of Ashvattha's Concourses?
Arama: No, it is not. But it is a great discovery nonetheless. Here lies a song that we Aranara have been unable to find for many, many years.
Arama: Aranara song gatherers always pursue the beauty of songs. At the end of time, they will leave behind a song that belongs only to themselves.
Traveler: Does this have anything to do with Ashvattha's Concourses?
Arama: Yes! This seems to be the song left by Araji. If that's the case, there should be a Vasara Tree nearby.
Paimon: Paimon remembers Araja saying something about the Vasara Trees... Let Paimon check the Aranyaka real quick...
Paimon: #Vasara Trees bear Vasoma Fruits! We should help them, Traveler!
Arayasa: "Aah, this yearning will bear fruit as scarlet as pomegranates. Even if fate clouds your eyes..."
Traveler: Since we need it to help Rana...
Arama: Well, anyway, the song is hidden among the roses. Arayasa and I have looked for a long, long time, but we couldn't find anything. The roses wouldn't talk to us either.
Paimon: #Paimon sees. Traveler, let's try having a look, too!
Traveler: I'll give it a go.
Paimon: Yup! And anyway, finding stuff is what we do best!
Traveler: "I will illuminate your song."
Paimon: ...
Traveler: "The song from your lips cannot be taken away..."
Paimon: #Ughhh! Traveler, what are you doing!? You're acting all weird!
Arama: #I think Nara Traveler should get along very well with Arayasa!
Paimon: #Don't encourage him!
Traveler: Best of luck to you, then.
Arama: #Thank you, Nara Traveler! This seems to be the song left by Araji. If that's the case, there should be a Vasara Tree nearby. We have the best luck!
Traveler: "Ahh, our sinfully sweet destinies."
Paimon: #Eek!! Stop, Traveler! Stop!
Arama: #Nara Traveler is awesome! Your song is just like Arayasa's! I didn't understand a word of what either of you sang!
Traveler: Is he a bard?

## Talk 3

Paimon: We meet again, Arama!
Arama: #Ooh! Nara Traveler and Paimon! Hello!
Arama: Right, this is Arayasa. He is also a song gatherer.
Paimon: Hello, Arayasa!
Traveler: Hello!
Arayasa: #"The next song is a poem about a young woman in search of the thing most dear to her. At the journey's beginning, her eyes were amber, without a hint of gloom..."
Paimon: ...?
Traveler: That's a little odd...
Arama: Arayasa is the boldest among the Aranara song gatherers and often learns Nara songs. That's why he talks in a special way.
Arayasa: "Our destinies were like pearls born in the same hour..."
Traveler: We're not getting through at all...
Paimon: Let's get back to the point... Since Arayasa is a song gatherer, does that mean there is a Concourse of Ashvattha around here?
Arama: Araji left his last song here. In that case, there should be a Vasara Tree nearby!
Paimon: #Well, let's help out too, Traveler! We've gotta hurry and get that Vasoma Fruit!
Arayasa: "Aah, this yearning will bear fruit as scarlet as pomegranates. Even if fate clouds your eyes..."
Traveler: For Rana...
Arama: #As before, the song is hidden among the roses. But since it's Nara Traveler and Paimon, I'm sure you'll find it!
Traveler: Leave this to me.
Paimon: Yep! Paimon will!
Traveler: "I will illuminate your song."
Paimon: ...
Traveler: "The song from your lips cannot be taken away..."
Paimon: #Uhhh— Traveler, what are you doing!? You're acting all weird!
Arama: #I think Nara Traveler should get along very well with Arayasa!
Paimon: #Don't encourage him!
Traveler: "Ahh, our sinfully sweet destinies."
Paimon: #Eek!! Stop, Traveler! Stop!
Arama: #Nara Traveler is awesome! I didn't understand a word of what you sang!
Traveler: Is he a bard?

## Talk 4

Arama: Ooh... This is Araji's song...
Arayasa: Ahh... I was able to hear your song again. Our promise can finally be fulfilled. Araji, I will carry your song with me and keep on singing.
Arayasa: Thank you, good Nara. Arayasa will not forget.
Paimon: Huh. Somehow Arayasa's kinda speaking normally!
Arama: #Thank you, Nara Traveler and Paimon! Arayasa and Araji are good friends, so he's been looking for this song all this time.
Arayasa: Araji is a... timid friend who liked to hide in quiet places and sing softly. His songs can open unknown paths. Now that you understand this song...
Arayasa: You'll be able to open the path to Ashvattha's Concourse located here.
Arama: Yep! You can leave the rest to us!
Arayasa: #Okay, let's meet at Festival Utsava, handsome Nara.

## Talk 5

Arama: Hm... The song should be hidden amongst those roses...

## Talk 6

Arayasa: "On the other side of the distant horizon..."

## Talk 7

Paimon: Is this... the Vasara Tree? Doesn't seem as lively as Paimon imagined...
Arama: Yes, the corrosion from Marana is getting worse. It's not only the land. Marana exists in the Sarva, too.
Arama: Marana will speak of the horrors of death to the trees and flowers it corrodes. Life that did not know of death will then begin to wither.
Arama: We have been fighting against Marana. Araji was also fighting hard against it.
Paimon: Araji? Isn't that someone you mentioned? An Aranara who lived in the past?
Arama: #Yes. Thank you, Araji. We've never met before, but your song sounds great. Please, leave the rest to me, Nara Traveler, and Paimon.
Traveler: How can we get the Vasoma Fruit?
Arama: First, we must enter his dream to destroy Marana's lingering influence.
Paimon: Wait a second... When you say "his dream," you mean that of the Vasara Tree?
Arama: Yes. If you are ready, reach out your hand and enter his dream...

## Talk 8

Traveler: I need a minute.
Arama: No problem. I'll wait for you.

## Talk 9

Arama: #Nara Traveler, if you are ready, reach out your hand and enter his dream...

## Talk 10

Paimon: Paimon didn't expect Marana's corruption to be here too...
Arama: #Nara Traveler is amazing. You drove Marana away easily this time, too.
Arama: The corrosion from Marana is getting worse. It's not just infecting the land. It is here, and even in Sarva.
Arama: Marana will speak of the horrors of death to the trees and flowers it corrodes. Life that did not know of death will then begin to wither.
Arama: We have been fighting against Marana. Araji was also fighting hard against it.
Paimon: Araji? Isn't that someone you mentioned? An Aranara who lived in the past?
Arama: #Yes. Thank you, Araji. We've never met before, but your song sounds great. Please, leave the rest to me, Nara Traveler, and Paimon.
Traveler: Do we need to enter the dream of the Vasara Tree this time too?
Arama: Yes. We must erase all traces of Marana's influence.
Arama: That's right. If you are ready, reach out your hand and enter his dream...

## Talk 11

Paimon: Next up, our third Vasoma Fruit!
Traveler: Let's do this for the Bija...
Arama: The corrosion from Marana is getting worse. It's not just infecting the land. It is here, and even in Sarva.
Arama: Marana will speak of the horrors of death to the trees and flowers it corrodes. Life that did not know of death will then begin to wither.
Arama: We have been fighting against Marana. Araji was also fighting hard against it.
Paimon: Araji? Isn't that someone you mentioned? An Aranara who lived in the past?
Arama: #Yes. Thank you, Araji. We've never met before, but your song sounds great. Please, leave the rest to me, Nara Traveler, and Paimon.
Traveler: Let's go.
Arama: If you are ready, reach out your hand and enter his dream...
Traveler: Let's do this for Rana...

## Talk 12

Traveler: (Reach your hand out to the Vasara Tree...)

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: We now have the second Vasoma Fruit!
Arama: #Impressive! Nara Traveler is not afraid of Marana and even drove all the monsters away. No wonder you could defeat Vanagni!
Paimon: Hehe, the many adventures we've been through aren't just for show, y'know?
Arama: #That's great! Then Nara Traveler and Paimon must have many memories and stories, right?
Traveler: We do have a great many, yes.
Arama: #I see. If you don't mind, we'd love to hear Nara Traveler and Paimon's stories sometime.
Paimon: Sure! We've shared our stories with others before, though it feels like so long ago...
Paimon: Speaking of which, Paimon saw a giant purple tree in the distance while we were in the Vasara Tree's dream. Paimon's pretty sure we saw it in Vanarana, too. What was that?
Arama: That's the very first Ashvattha's Tree of Dreams. Hmm, how should I put this...
Arama: Dreams are like leaves in a stream. They soon float away with the water. If you want to keep a dream in place, you have to let it grow roots. That way, the dream won't drift away.
Arama: Hmm... words are failing me...
Traveler: So Ashvattha's Tree of Dreams is like their "roots"?
Arama: #Nara Traveler is smart. This tree keeps Aranara's dreams stable. Aranara can enter or exit dreams and are able to connect with the Vasara Tree.
Paimon: So that's how it is. Do you mean, then, that the Vanarana in dreams can be maintained because of that tree?
Arama: It is because of the Tree of Dreams. But I'm very concerned about Marana right now. We'll have to come up with a plan later.
Arama: ...
Arama: #But let's get the Bija first! We need to help the friend of Nara Traveler, Paimon, and Arana!
Paimon: Will you be looking for other Ashvattha's Concourses after this, Arama?
Arama: Yes! So we'll see each other again for sure!
Paimon: Stay safe, Arama!
Arama: #You too, Nara Traveler and Paimon!
Traveler: So Ashvattha's Tree of Dreams keeps dreams from drifting away?
Traveler: Eh, we do have some.

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: We got the third Vasoma Fruit! According to Araja, three Vasoma Fruits should be enough, right?
Arama: #Yes, that will do. Thank you, Nara Traveler and Paimon!
Traveler: You're welcome.
Paimon: Still, you were the one helping us throughout, Arama. So why are you thanking us?
Arama: Well... It's because you are helping Arana, and Arana is my friend. So, thank you.
Arama: #And Nara Traveler has helped Arayasa, Aradasa, and Arasudraka find the ancient songs. They're my friends too. Thank you for that, too.
Arama: #Finally, I'm so happy that I got to go on adventures with Nara Traveler and Paimon. So, thanks for that as well.
Paimon: Paimon had a good time too! Thank you, Arama!
Paimon: By the way, there are many signs of activity around Ashvattha's Concourses... Is there some story behind that?
Arama: That's a story from long, long ago. I wasn't even a seed then. It was a time when all Nara could see Aranara and not a single Aranara was afraid of Nara.
Arama: #Back then, Nara and Aranara helped each other. They played and sang together, just like Nara Traveler and I.
Arama: Song gatherers like Arayasa originally learned their craft from Nara.
Arama: Ashvattha's Concourses used to be where Nara and Aranara played together. But that was a long time ago.
Arama: After the horrible, horrible catastrophe occurred, Vanarana was devastated, and the concourses were left desolate...
Paimon: So that's what happened...
Arama: Yes, and it's a very scary tale indeed. I'm lucky that they are not memories to me — only stories.
Paimon: #Don't worry! Things will get better. Right, Traveler?
Traveler: That's right.
Arama: We've found Ashvattha's Concourses and obtained three Vasoma Fruits. Next, I've got to help prepare for Festival Utsava and call some of my friends back from the forest.
Paimon: Best of luck, Arama! Paimon's super looking forward to the festival!
Arama: Me too! I'll see you guys soon!
Paimon: Bye, Arama!
Traveler: I wouldn't be too sure...
Paimon: #...Are you tired, Traveler?
Traveler: You've been the one helping us...
