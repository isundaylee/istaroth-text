# Jade Chamber Rising


## Talk 1

Ningguang: I have gathered everyone here today to make an important announcement.
Ningguang: Perhaps some of you will have heard the news already. I am, in fact, planning to rebuild the Jade Chamber.
Hongfei: Rebuild the Jade Chamber? That's a huge project...
Changgui: So the rumors are true. No wonder the price of building materials has gone up so much lately.
Zhicheng: The Jade Chamber means a lot to Lady Ningguang. Getting involved in this would be a huge opportunity...
Hongfei: Lady Ningguang, is there any way we can be of service?
Ningguang: Patience. Since the news made it out a few days ago, I have already had many people contacting me to declare an interest in joining the project.
Ningguang: Nevertheless, I do have a few matters I should like to entrust to you here today.
Ningguang: The building site has been chosen, and most of the materials have been assembled. Three key items are, however, still outstanding.
Ningguang: They are as follows: Sunset Vermillionite, Wonder Cores, and Adepti Sigils.
Changgui: Uh... Excuse my ignorance, Lady Ningguang. I'm familiar enough with Plaustrite, but I've never even heard of those other two.
Ningguang: Only sufficiently large pieces of Plaustrite — or specifically, Vermillionite — may earn themselves the "Sunset" moniker. This stone is what allows the Jade Chamber to float. Wonder Cores, meanwhile, are the central components of the mechanical structure of the Jade Chamber.
Ningguang: Adepti Sigils serve as a means of integrating the mechanical devices with adepti art. They are as indispensable as the mechanical core itself.
Ningguang: Although these three items are rare, I trust that with your connections and capabilities, procuring them will not be a question of "if," but of "when."
Ningguang: I take the saying "Time is money" more seriously than most. Efficiency is everything. I will pay a generous price for the materials that you find, and in addition, the first three people who collect all the materials will have the opportunity to ask me a question.
Ningguang: You may ask me anything, and I will give you an honest answer. I trust that this means of compensation will be to everyone's satisfaction.
Changgui: These things won't be easy to get hold of, but if it means a chance to get some inside information on Liyue Harbor's development plan for next year...
Zhicheng: ...Then it's the deal of a lifetime. Information from Lady Ningguang is priceless. Whoever gets to it first takes the market...
Hongfei: Haha, what a coincidence! I won't divulge too much, but I heard some murmurings about some Plaustrite just the other day. So excuse me, all, but I have some business to do!
Changgui: Ah, no... We'd better move quickly, or this opportunity will be snatched away from us!
Paimon: Ningguang's rebuilding the Jade Chamber!? This is a huge deal. Let's get involved!
Ningguang: So you heard my announcement, did you? What do you think? Interested?
Traveler: Can I really ask you anything at all?
Ningguang: Yes, providing the question pertains to something I am knowledgeable about.
Traveler: #(Maybe I can find out more about my {F#brother}{M#sister}...)
Paimon: Really? Ooh, then Paimon will ask you about how to run a business!
Paimon: Then we will never be short of Mora ever again!
Ningguang: Hehe, of course. But how much information I share with you will depend on your performance.
Ningguang: The construction of the Jade Chamber requires a great deal of space. The abandoned mine outside the Golden House has been selected as the building site. Once you have collected the materials, please take them there.
Ningguang: I have other business to attend to now, otherwise I would gladly escort you to the site in person. When you do arrive, please seek out my secretary.
Ningguang: Remember, this is a race against the clock. A rare opportunity presents itself to you... Do not let somebody else snatch it from your grasp.
Paimon: Ningguang seems super busy... C'mon, we'd better get going.
Paimon: #First we gotta get out of Yujing Terrace... Huh? Look, {NICKNAME}, it seems like there's something kinda fishy going on over there.
Scar Liu: Ma'am, you seem like an eminent and distinguished young lady to me. I can see that you're easily gonna win this procurement contest Lady Ningguang has set up.
Scar Liu: As it happens, we have some information about the materials that I really think might interest you. Come on, let's find somewhere a little more private, and we can get down to brass tacks...
Shenhe: No. I don't need it.
Scar Liu: Aww, don't be like that. Hey, come on, don't go!
Scar Liu: Well don't just stand there, after her!
Qiang the Brave: Oh, right, yeah!

## Talk 2

Changfeng: The rebuilding of the Jade Chamber is a monumental task, and we are the ones who have been entrusted with this work. It is only right that we put our hearts and souls into this project.

## Talk 3

Scar Liu: Hehe. Well, will you look at that, Ma'am. Nowhere left to run.
Scar Liu: Don't worry. We're not bad guys. You give us some Mora, we give you a little info, everybody's a winner.
Qiang the Brave: Boss, I got a bad feeling about this. Look at her, the white hair, the energy she gives off... I'm telling you, there's something different about her...
Scar Liu: So what? She's loaded! How are we ever going to repay those gambling debts if we just let money walk away from us, huh?
Shenhe: I've already told you. I don't need your information.
Shenhe: If you still can't grasp that, I'm happy to repeat it in a way that won't be so easy to forget.
Scar Liu: *sigh* ...Come on, Ma'am. You seem like an intelligent lady. I shouldn't have to spell this out to you.
Scar Liu: It's not about whether you need the info or not, okay? It's about you taking out your money and handing it over and nobody getting hurt.
Shenhe: I won't—
Scar Liu: No more excuses! I know you have money. I saw you.
Scar Liu: Yeah, I saw you, strolling into Liuli Pavilion, ordering a table full of food, and only taking a few bites.
Scar Liu: Then Xinyue Kiosk, then Wanmin Restaurant. Same story each time — you order all the signature dishes, take a few bites, then you're on your way again.
Scar Liu: How could you afford to be so wasteful if you weren't from a rich family? And since you're so rich, what's the loss to you in giving us a little spare change, huh?
Shenhe: Master warned me not to lay a hand on anyone in Liyue Harbor...
Shenhe: But here we are. Perhaps... Yes. Let's call it "fate."
Qiang the Brave: Boss, I'm telling you, something's not right...
Scar Liu: What are you afraid of? We're just selling information, it's not illegal. If she lays a finger on us, all the better — we'll sue her for everything she's worth!
Traveler: There they are.
Zheng: Oh? You again.
Scar Liu: The Millelith? Wh—What are the Millelith doing here? Did you do this? Hmph! You oughta mind your own business! I swear—
Zheng: Silence! How dare you threaten innocent civilians! You're coming with us!
Scar Liu: Hehe... Don't be angry, Sir. Please, let me explain.
Black Screen Text: The Millelith takes away the hooligans who were surrounding the young lady with white hair.
Shenhe: ...
Traveler: Are you alright?
Shenhe: ...Shenhe.
Paimon: Shenhe?
Shenhe: My name.
Paimon: #Ohh, so your name's Shenhe! Paimon's name is... well, Paimon! And this is Paimon's travel buddy, {NICKNAME}!
Shenhe: I've heard about you two before. Thank you for helping to defuse the situation.
Shenhe: I could've dealt with it myself, though. I suspect smashing his head against the ground a handful of times is all it would have taken to get him to surrender.
Paimon: Aaaah! Y—You can't do that! That's way too violent!
Paimon: This is Liyue Harbor. There are laws against that kinda stuff you know!
Shenhe: ...Laws?
Traveler: Have you not heard of the law, Shenhe?
Shenhe: No. Apparently not.
Paimon: Really!? So how exactly have you—
Traveler: Um... What was that noise...
Shenhe: That would be my stomach growling. I haven't eaten enough.
Paimon: She's so honest...
Paimon: Wait, that's right — they said you went around all the restaurants ordering this and that and the other, but only took a small bite of each dish...
Paimon: Then of course you're still hungry! So... anything in particular you're hungry for?
Shenhe: Qingxin, Glaze Lily, Violetgrass. These are my usuals.
Traveler: Those are all medicinal herbs...
Shenhe: ...Medicinal herbs?
Paimon: Kinda hard to explain... Anyway, Bubu Pharmacy's not far away. Let's take Shenhe there for a big medicinal meal!
Paimon: After all, you can't work on an empty stomach!
Traveler: Don't worry. Everything's okay now.
Traveler: They're trying to intimidate people into doing business.

## Talk 4

Herbalist Gui: Are you here to buy some herbs? I do hope you brought your prescription?
Shenhe: Qingxin, Glaze Lily, and Violetgrass, please. Half a pound of each.
Herbalist Gui: What kind of prescription is this? Sounds more like a lunch order, hah... Oh, here you go, that's everything we have in stock.
Shenhe: Thank you.
Paimon: She's... really eating them...
Black Screen Text: To everyone's astonishment, Shenhe polishes off all the medicinal herbs.
Shenhe: My hunger has now abated. Thank you.
Traveler: How did they taste...?
Shenhe: Rather awful.
Shenhe: Though they were not completely devoid of sweet fragrance, after consuming a large quantity of them, bitterness is all that remains.
Paimon: ...So how come you chow down on these and barely touch the restaurant food?
Paimon: If Paimon had enough Mora, Paimon would go to the fanciest restaurant in town, and order a whole table of food, and eat it all in one go!
Shenhe: Because I'm not sure whether I will remain here in the future.
Shenhe: The food of the mortal realm is most delicious. But should I return to the mountains, yearning for the food here shall only pose an obstacle to my continued spiritual development.
Shenhe: Sampling each dish in order to appreciate its taste is enough.
Paimon: #"Return to the mountains"... That proves it. {NICKNAME}! Paimon knew she was an adeptus!
Shenhe: Enough about me. What are your plans from here?
Paimon: Oh right! Paimon almost forgot. We came out to take part in the rebuild-the-Jade-Chamber competition!
Paimon: And... and now we're probably super behind because we've been held up for so long...
Shenhe: I see. I heard something about the contest when I was passing by.
Paimon: Hehe... Yep, you get to ask Ningguang any question you want if you win!
Paimon: Were you interested in the contest too, Shenhe?
Shenhe: I came for the rebuilding of the Jade Chamber. But until this point, I had no intention of joining a contest.
Shenhe: However, you have shown me your kindness, and I would now like to lend you my assistance. Don't worry. I ask for nothing in return.
Paimon: Wow! You really don't have to...
Paimon: ...but having an adeptus help out will make things a whole lot easier, so...
Traveler: Sure. Then let's join forces.
Shenhe: Then let's not delay. I have a plan.
Paimon: Great! Paimon bets this is gonna be the awesomest plan ever!
Shenhe: I am not sure whether, or to what extent, this plan can be classified as "awesome." I do, however, believe it will be highly effective.
Shenhe: We simply need to dispose of everyone who is currently ahead of us. Then, we alone shall become the victors.
Paimon: ...Veto! That is not acceptable, not by a long shot!
Shenhe: Really? But I hear that competition is in essence about conflict and one-upmanship...
Paimon: Look, we want to win this competition fair and square, okay!
Paimon: Sunset Vermillionite, Wonder Cores, and Adepti Sigils... Let's start at the top of the list and work down. So for Plaustrite—
Baizhu: I was wondering who I could hear arguing over there. So, it's you.
Paimon: Baizhu! What are you doing out here?
Baizhu: Lady Ningguang wishes to purchase a large batch of wound dressing. We're running low at the store, so I came out to fetch the ingredients personally.
Paimon: Huh? How come Lady Ningguang needs so much wound dressing all of a sudden?
Baizhu: I'm not too sure. I did hear that she's looking to rebuild the Jade Chamber, maybe for its first aid on site? I didn't ask, though — far be it from me to pry into my customers' personal affairs.
Baizhu: Oh, and she also borrowed Qiqi... meaning Bubu Pharmacy is very short-handed right now. I don't suppose any of you are looking for part-time work, by any chance?
Paimon: No, no, we've got other stuff to do... While you're here, though, you seem to know a lot — have you ever heard of something called "Sunset Vermillionite"?
Baizhu: Ah, the variety of Plaustrite used in the Jade Chamber, yes? There is some mention of it in the "Seven Mountain Treatises." When activated, Sunset Vermillionite rises up all the way into the clouds. It's very rare indeed.
Baizhu: As far as the records show, virtually all Sunset Vermillionite in existence has been mined and taken possession of. But the Feiyun Commerce Guild would know far more about this than I do.
Paimon: Okay then! Let's go ask at the Feiyun Commerce Guild.
Paimon: Thanks, Baizhu!
Baizhu: You're quite welcome. Good luck to you all, and if there's anything further you need from me, just come to Bubu Pharmacy.
Traveler: We welcome you to our team.
Traveler: Are they really that good?

## Talk 5

Leming: First, we construct the keel of the Jade Chamber. The keel is the part that holds the Plaustrite, so once that arrives, it goes straight in...

## Talk 6

Anshun: Normally, it would be Lady Keqing supervising the construction work. But it seems like she's been a little preoccupied lately...

## Talk 7

Baizhu: Why does Lady Ningguang need so much wound dressing?
Baizhu: Is it really such risky business, rebuilding the Jade Chamber? This is all most peculiar...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Lizheng: Shh... Quiet! Can't you see that I'm concentrating here? Every brick is a crucial component! If I stop concentrating, I'm gonna lay a brick out of whack, and that'll put the whole darn structure out of whack, and then... Well, shoot, and then it's all over...

### Additional Talk 2

Siqin: I'm under orders to ensure the security of this location. It's imperative that construction stays on schedule. Hopefully, there won't be any setbacks.

### Additional Talk 3

Liang: We've been pretty active in the Millelith recently. I don't know what's going on but... I'd better be careful.

### Additional Talk 4

Baiwen: This is a matter of utmost importance. I must not let Lady Ningguang down...
Baiwen: Oh? Are you here to deliver construction materials?
