Traveler: And so you acted on your own?
Tahmures: I'd like to call it "seizing a great academic opportunity with great precision."
Tahmures: The Children of Echoes and their Saurian partners are all very adept at digging, so I hired the seasoned Mr. Akeor as my archaeological partner.
Tahmures: And not to brag, but what we've found is already enough to sustain at least a year's academic work for me.
Tahmures: Still, we've got to hurry. The people of Natlan have long gotten used to living around these ruins, so they often just use the antiques they find as daily tools.
Tahmures: ...I'll write another letter to the Akademiya, if for nothing else than the hope that they'll convince the locals to stop using priceless relics to build up their walls.
