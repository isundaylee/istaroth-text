Traveler: About Iotham...
Alphonso: The good news is Iotham is unharmed. But... the incident with Rana was a major blow to him.
Alphonso: But as they say, "Do not yield to the wind, or the rain. Do not yield to the winter snow, or the summer heat..."
Alphonso: It's these setbacks that help us grow stronger. I hope Iotham will learn from this experience too.
