Traveler: About Rukh Shah...
Sekkura: Rukh Shah is not only dependable, he's the youngest Parchamdar in Corps history!
Sekkura: Supposedly he's from the rainforest, not the desert.
Sekkura: You know how rare rainforest people are in the ranks of the Eremites, much less a Parchamdar.
Sekkura: He's very impressive, getting along not only with the desert dwellers, but Akademiya researchers too.
Sekkura: Maybe there's truth to the rumor that he was once a researcher himself.
