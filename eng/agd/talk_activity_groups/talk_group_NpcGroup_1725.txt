Paimon: #Traveler, look over here! These desserts look delicious!
Paimon: You'd think desserts like those wouldn't last long, but even the fruit on the cake looks so fresh, like someone just made it! Paimon's drooling just looking at it...
Paimon: #Mmm... Traveler? Just think, there's no one else around, and it'll go to waste if someone doesn't eat it soon. Why don't we just try a mouthful... or two?
Traveler: I don't think that's a good idea.
Paimon: M—Maybe you're right. They look so lovingly made, and it might have been Lisa who made them... It seems wrong to just start eating them without asking permission...
Paimon: *sniff* Paimon would love to try them out, but seeing as you're against it, let's leave them for now...
Traveler: It might be a trap for catching Paimons!
Paimon: Huh!? You're saying that these desserts are actually monsters in disguise, and that when Paimon goes to eat them, they'll *chomp* gobble her down in a single bite instead...?
Paimon: N—No way, that's impossible! But they look so lovingly made, and it might have been Lisa who made them... It seems wrong to just start eating them without asking permission...
