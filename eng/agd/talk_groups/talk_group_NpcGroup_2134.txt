Master of Stars: Hmm? You speak to Starsnatcher, Celestial Lord...
Master of Stars: ...Well, a follower of his, at any rate. What is it?

Traveler: Your mask...
Master of Stars: Familiar, isn't it? I picked it up below the inn. I suppose that it must be the one that Lord Starsnatcher always wore.
Master of Stars: But this has to be a spare. I can't imagine that Lord Starsnatcher would just leave his mask behind...
Master of Stars: What sin must we have committed for us to be abandoned by Lord Starsnatcher? Come to think of it, I have not seen His Lordship in many days...

Traveler: He's a fake, you know.
Master of Stars: Preposterous! Preposterous!
Master of Stars: How dare you slander Lord Starsnatcher in the presence of his followers? You, you...
Master of Stars: ...Hmph. A follower of an adeptus must not swear. What's more, I am wearing His Lordship's mask.
Master of Stars: Leave. Leave now. I do not wish to speak to you. Aye, you must be a fake yourself, you fake!

Traveler: Nothing, see you around.
Master of Stars: Oh, are you a follower of Lord Starsnatcher as well? If you should ever have the good fortune to see him again, please tell me.
