# Run, Hilmi, Run!


## Talk 1

Ebeid: #{F#Miss}{M#Mister}! Wait!
Ebeid: Are you... an adventurer? I mean the kind of adventurers who are skilled in battle and travel to many places.
Traveler: You could say that.
Ebeid: #Look, Hilmi! I said he must be an adventurer!
Hilmi: But don't adventurers always wear those green outfits?
Traveler: I'm too skilled to need that green outfit.
Hilmi: Wow!
Ebeid: Wow!
Ebeid: In that case, you can definitely help us!
Ebeid: Do you see that big warehouse in the village? Habachi said we must keep watch over it because many important things are kept there.
Hilmi: He also told us that if any bad guys come, he'll shut down the lift and cut off the bridge.
Ebeid: But the lift is some distance away from the warehouse. To shut it down, Habachi will have to run really fast.
Ebeid: We thought we could train with him, but he's been ignoring our offer...
Hilmi: How I wish he could instead ignore us when we try to sneak out to skip stones! Like that's gonna happen... Hmph!
Ebeid: Ahem, anyway, if Habachi happens to be exhausted when the bad guys come, we'll shut down the lift for him.
Ebeid: You're an adventurer, so you must be a fast runner, too! Please train with us.
Traveler: Sure. Let's run together.
Ebeid: Yay! Thank you!
Hilmi: We've chosen the starting point. Let's go there!
Hilmi: Hehe, I will be your rival. For the record, I'm a really good runner!
Traveler: You can trust Habachi...
Ebeid: Play with us, please!
Ebeid: #Play with us, please, nice Mister!
Traveler: Okay...
Ebeid: Yay! Thank you!
Traveler: I'm quite special and don't need that outfit.
Traveler: That's sort of accurate.

## Talk 2

Hilmi: *huff* I—I won!
Traveler: C—Congratulations...
Hilmi: Hehe, I told you how good I am! You underestimated me, didn't you?
Ebeid: But even if we can run this fast, we can't outrun Habachi. I just don't understand why.
Traveler: There might be a shortcut.
Ebeid: Is that so? But I don't think there's any shortcut around.
Hilmi: #{F#Miss}{M#Mister}, can you play with us next time...
Hilmi: I mean... train with us! Um... Let's train that "tracking in the wilderness" thing!
Ebeid: You're right! Since we can't outrun Habachi, we can get around him...
Hilmi: We tried that before, didn't we? But it never worked...
Traveler: He might be playing some trick.
Traveler: You were... almost flying...

## Talk 3

Hilmi: Huff... You ran so fast!
Traveler: Because I—I'm an adventurer...
Ebeid: We aren't fast enough. Habachi can definitely catch us... What do we do?
Hilmi: Besides, he's not even out of breath each time he catches us. He doesn't even look like he was running.
Traveler: There might be a shortcut.
Ebeid: Is that so? But I don't think there's any shortcut around.
Hilmi: #{F#Miss}{M#Mister}, can you play with us next time...
Hilmi: I mean... train with us! Um... Let's train that "tracking in the wilderness" thing!
Ebeid: You're right! Since we can't outrun Habachi, we can get around him...
Hilmi: We tried that before, didn't we? But it never worked...
Traveler: He might be playing some trick.
Traveler: Because I've run many, many times.
