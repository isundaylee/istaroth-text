Traveler: Can I ask about swords and blades in Inazuma?
Amenoma Tougo: Oh, are you also interested in the Inazuman weapons? Seems like you're something of a master of the sword yourself.
Amenoma Tougo: We Inazuman artisans use a special material called Jade Steel, which is produced from Tatarasuna, when forging weapons. It makes the sword tougher and sharper. That's the reason why Inazuman weapons are some of the best in the world.
Amenoma Tougo: Naturally, we have also inherited the techniques of forging weapons using Jade Steel. The key to that is using our perseverance to bring out the strength of the steel.

Amenoma Tougo: Everyone who visits Amenoma Smithy has witnessed our skill in forging weapons. However, only very few have enough perseverance to carry on the spirit of the Amenoma Art.

Traveler: The blades aren't exactly the same as the ones in Liyue.
Amenoma Tougo: Yeah, the materials and methods used to forge the weapons aren't the same, so the resulting weapons would be of a different style as well.
Amenoma Tougo: I heard that Liyue's Archon, Rex Lapis, was skilled at the forging of weapons. Previously, I was curious about what the blades made in Liyue were like.
Amenoma Tougo: So a while ago, I requested someone from the Crux Fleet to bring a weapon made in Liyue to me. I learned a lot after studying that weapon.
Amenoma Tougo: Now, I have fully grasped the techniques that were used to forge that weapon. Seeing as you have deep connections with Liyue, I'll gift this weapon to you.
