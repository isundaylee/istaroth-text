Traveler: Well, let's hear it.
Dongsheng: I used to be an adventurer who visited every corner of the world.
Dongsheng: But the good times couldn't last. I got into an accident in Dihua Marsh, and was seriously injured.
Dongsheng: Fortunately, a masked adeptus came to my rescue, and I was barely able to escape with my life.
Dongsheng: From that day on, I never ventured out again. This life was given to me by that adeptus. I can't just throw it away that easily.
Dongsheng: An ancient adage of Liyue says that "a withered tree lives again," referring to life being given anew â€” which fits my experience exactly.
Dongsheng: That's why I adapted the last part of that saying and made it the name of my shop, to commemorate that event.
