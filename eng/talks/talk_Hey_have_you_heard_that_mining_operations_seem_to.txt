Mikhail: Hey, have you heard that mining operations seem to have resumed in The Chasm of Liyue? The area has been sealed for quite some time.
Lyudmila: Do you mean to say that The Chasm is now open to ordinary citizens?
Mikhail: Not yet 100% open I presume, but small-scale mining is allowed there. Still, they wouldn't let ordinary people go in.
Mikhail: But we're the powerful Fatui â€” they'll definitely green light our actions!
Mikhail: But I heard that people can feel some strange shaking from deep down in The Chasm. It doesn't seem to be caused by mining.
Lyudmila: That doesn't sound good. I've heard long ago that they dug something ominous up from The Chasm. Is the rumor true...
Mikhail: Hmm, the way I see it, there's no need to worry too much about it.
Mikhail: Perhaps it's just an ordinary Ley Line phenomenon, or perhaps it's because the Qixing did something.
Mikhail: We'll find out when the people we sent earlier come back!
Lyudmila: Um... Let's hope they can return safe and sound...
