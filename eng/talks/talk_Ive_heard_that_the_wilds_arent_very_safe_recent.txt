# Talk Dialog

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "I've heard that the wilds aren't very safe recently, and that monster attacks on merchant caravans are getting more and more frequent. How will that affect sales of our tribe's ores? Will it impact the incomes of our crew?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "As for the problem with the volume of ore sales, Boss Pacal has mentioned it. The number of tourists visiting the People of the Springs has increased significantly, so they'll be importing way more raw materials than last year..."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "The Scions of the Canopy are equipping their Couriers with new gear, and they need raw metals the most. The Masters of the Night-Wind and Flower-Feather Clan are both conducting extensive building renovations, so they'll also be using a considerable amount of ores."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "As for the Collective of Plenty, trade's always been stable, and the produce from Varesa's place has gotten even cheaper, so there's no need to worry about income!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "I'd like to add that I've heard that all the tribes are in the middle of reorganizing their anti-monster patrols in accordance with the experience of the veterans, so the current increased threat is only temporary."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "And so what if there's a few more monsters? We Children of Echoes happen to have more energy and zeal than we know what to do with! Put down your pickaxes and pick up your axes, we'll cut 'em all down!"
