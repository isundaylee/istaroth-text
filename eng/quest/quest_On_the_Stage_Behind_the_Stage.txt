# On the Stage, Behind the Stage


## Talk 1

Tea Master Liu Su: Ugh, just my luck. I'm not gonna tell any more stories today, not today, I swear it!
Traveler: What's going on?
Tea Master Liu Su: This tiny little stage is really annoying me. It's been poorly maintained for decades! It squeaks at the lightest touch!
Tea Master Liu Su: I've long told our boss, Fan Er'ye, that it needed to be replaced, but he would always brush me off, saying that he couldn't find a good carpenter to do the job.
Tea Master Liu Su: Today, when I was telling the story of "The Wrath of Haishan," it would make that infernal squeak with every pose I would strike.
Tea Master Liu Su: Nothing could've killed the mood more effectively. Everyone present burst out laughing, and some even made fun of me for it.
Tea Master Liu Su: I'm fed up with it. I must bring a good carpenter to see Fan Er'ye. Then we'll see what other excuses he can come up with this time!
Tea Master Liu Su: You're from the Adventurers' Guild, right? Can I just directly ask you to find a carpenter for me?
Traveler: How do I find the carpenter?
Tea Master Liu Su: Oh, my bad. You don't look like you're from around here. How can I expect you to know where to find good carpenters?
Tea Master Liu Su: Well, then, how about you go to Qingce Village and look for Master Lu at Fanmu Carpenter's. He's known for good skills. Please ask him if he's willing to help me.
Tea Master Liu Su: He can send an apprentice if he's not available.
Tea Master Liu Su: Any carpenter from Fanmu Carpenter's can manage the job, and if they build it right, that means we can finally have a befitting stage for Ms. Yun.
Tea Master Liu Su: Hah! I'm such a genius! With this reasoning that I just came up with, I don't see how Er'ye could say no again this time.
Tea Master Liu Su: Just rest assured, as long as you bring the carpenter here, you'll be paid in full.
Traveler: Got it.
Tea Master Liu Su: Then I'll be counting on you. I'm at the tea house every day. Come to me when you've found our carpenter.
Traveler: Who should I look for?

## Talk 2

Tea Master Liu Su: Er'ye, you need to seriously think about it, or else they'll all go to Third-Round Knockout.

## Talk 3

Master Lu: #What's the hurry, young {M#man}{F#lady}? Would you like to sit down and have a cup of tea?
Traveler: Master Lu...
Black Screen Text: You explain Liu Su's request to Master Lu...
Master Lu: Oh, it's not difficult to build a new stage, but I'm afraid I can't help.
Master Lu: Liyue Harbor is too far away. No one will be taking care of Fanmu Carpenter's if I go.
Master Lu: What's more, I'm too old to travel this far. It would take a toll on my fragile bones.
Traveler: Then we won't bother Fanmu Carpenter's.
Master Lu: Hang on a second. Since you've traveled all the way here, why don't I recommend someone capable to you?
Master Lu: Although he's not yet my apprentice, I've been considering the possibility of accepting him...
Dayu: Master Lu, I'm almost done with the four-chair set the village head wanted, but I ran out of wood for the last chair.
Granny Ruoxin: Dayu, thank you for helping out in the village.
Master Lu: Speak of the devil! I was about to say that Dayu can handle your request as well.
Dayu: Do you have a job for me? But I'm not yet Master Lu's apprentice, so I can't represent Fanmu Carpenter's.
Master Lu: Calm down there. They came from Liyue Harbor and want us to build a new stage for Heyu Tea House.
Dayu: Oh, you want "us" to build a stage? "Us" means me and Master Lu. Did you hear that, Granny Ruoxin?
Granny Ruoxin: Yes I did. Hehe, Master Lu, Dayu really wants to be your apprentice — he only follows you around at Fanmu Carpenter's when there are so many other choices.
Granny Ruoxin: He's a diligent and kind boy. It's time you gave the nod.
Master Lu: Got it, got it. I've already asked him to take jobs on my behalf. I think I've made myself quite clear.
Dayu: Thank you, Master!
Master Lu: Dayu, the first job I'm going to officially send you on is to build a stage for Heyu Tea House. Do your best and make me proud.
Dayu: Piece of cake — I've worked for the carpenter who built the stage for the Jade Chamber.
Master Lu: Don't be so proud yet. The stage of Heyu Tea House has lasted for decades. You gotta build a sturdy one for them too.
Granny Ruoxin: Oh, so this is all for Er'ye's tea house? How has he managed to never replace his tiny stage for so long...
Dayu: I'll take the job. Lemme finish the last chair in the set, and I'll come with you.
Dayu: I'm sorry that you'll have to wait a bit.
Dayu: I need three pieces of Pine Wood for the last chair. I'm going to collect some.
Traveler: We'll have to wait a bit?
Dayu: Well, if you don't want to wait, then you'll have to magically produce three pieces of Pine Wood right here, right now.
Traveler: Got it...
Dayu: So you really can do that! Then could I trouble you to bring me one Red Dye?
Traveler: Now, wait a minute!
Dayu: Haha, don't get so worked up. A great person like you must have a greater heart.
Traveler: We can't wait.
Traveler: Guess I can kiss that commission fee goodbye, then.
Traveler: There's something...

## Talk 4

Granny Ruoxin: Honestly, I'm quite shocked that Er'ye never replaced the stage for all the years...
Granny Ruoxin: He was stingy as a young man, and he's certainly got even worse over the years.
Traveler: Perhaps that's not the reason.
Granny Ruoxin: Hmph, I know him well enough to tell that he's making things difficult for himself again, even at this age...
Granny Ruoxin: Forget it. The little girl from the Yun family is going to visit me. I gotta go home and make some preparations for my guest.
Traveler: Perhaps there's more to it.

## Talk 5

Dayu: Thank you for your help. Have you found three pieces of Pine Wood and one Red Dye?

## Talk 6

Dayu: Here they are.
Black Screen Text: Dayu busies himself making the chair.
Dayu: The last chair is finished. Here you are, Granny Ruoxin. Now, time to head to the tea house.
Dayu: Take care, Master. I'll be back in a few days.
Master Lu: Alright, be safe.
Dayu: Well then, if I leave now, I'll reach Liyue Harbor by tomorrow evening.
Dayu: See you at the Heyu Tea House then.

## Talk 7

Dayu: What do you mean? Don't tell me that you're still arguing amongst yourselves?
Dayu: Oh, I get it. Mr. Liu Su wants to build a new stage, but he doesn't get to make the call here. Fan Er'ye, who is actually in charge, isn't keen on building something new. Fine.
Dayu: Just let me know when you two have things sorted out. I've just had a tiring trip and would like to get some rest while waiting.
Dayu: *sigh* This is just great...
Traveler: So, our trip is a waste in the end?
Tea Master Liu Su: Be patient. Let me try talking to him again.
Tea Master Liu Su: Er'ye, if you don't want to spend a small sum of money on this stage, you'll lose a big fortune in the future.
Tea Master Liu Su: Just think about it: Every time Ms. Yun gives her marvelous "spear flourish" performance, the audience will hear the squeak of the stage before they even get to applaud.
Tea Master Liu Su: Isn't that simply embarrassing? The Yun-Han Opera Troupe isn't obliged to perform at our tea house. They could go somewhere else if they're displeased. That would be a huge loss on our side.
Fan Er'ye: Ms. Yun is a dear friend, she would never do that to me.
Tea Master Liu Su: You're quite an optimist, aren't you? But I heard that many people have chosen to go to Third-Round Knockout instead of our tea house lately.
Tea Master Liu Su: Iron Tongue Tian has gotten even more popular than me. Could you try to be a little more realistic?
Tea Master Liu Su: With all the money Ms. Yun has earned for the tea house, don't tell me that you can't even afford to build a new stage.
Yun Jin: Did someone just call my name? Oh, it's you, Mr. Liu Su. You look angry. What happened?
Tea Master Liu Su: It's nothing. I'm not angry, actually. Well, are you here to perform today?
Yun Jin: I'm just here to have some tea and pay you and Er'ye a visit.
Yun Jin: #Ah, if it isn't {NICKNAME}.
Traveler: What a surprise...
Yun Jin: I'd say it's fate. I am not at all surprised.
Fan Er'ye: Haha, Ms. Yun certainly knows the art of conversation! Come, friends, I have some newly made tea from Qiaoying Village. Let's brew a pot.
Yun Jin: Er'ye, when I was downstairs, I heard that you are going to rebuild the stage. So, this day has finally come?
Fan Er'ye: Ahem... This will need a bit more consideration...
Yun Jin: Oh? A bit more consideration...
Yun Jin: Speaking of which, do you know who I visited in the Qingce Village today?
Fan Er'ye: You can just directly tell me that you went to see Ruoxin again.
Yun Jin: Good guess! Granny Ruoxin was asking about Heyu Tea House, and I told her that everything was the same as when she was young. Then she said...
Fan Er'ye: What did she say?
Yun Jin: Oops... I forgot what she said!
Fan Er'ye: You seem to have a good memory, but why does it have to fail on this particular day with something so important!
Fan Er'ye: Forget it. She'll be happy with things remaining as they were.
Fan Er'ye: Young people are always after new things and have little respect for the past. All you know is forcing me to rebuild the stage. The more I explain, the more you'll find me annoying, hmph.
Yun Jin: #Please don't get mad, Er'ye. Let's have tea, and I shall brew some. {NICKNAME} and Mr. Liu Su, could I trouble you to bring me some tea?
Traveler: I was just thinking about you...
Yun Jin: Hehe, you're being humorous.
Traveler: But what about our commission fee?

## Talk 8

Tea Master Liu Su: Ms. Yun, I was wondering why Er'ye refused to build a new stage despite all its benefits.
Tea Master Liu Su: Now I see why — thanks to your clever choice of topic.
Tea Master Liu Su: I understand his nostalgia. Yes I really do, but I didn't expect him to have held on to that for decades.
Yun Jin: Now we know the reason behind it.
Traveler: I don't get it.
Yun Jin: This is an old story, but since you're involved, I guess it won't hurt to tell you.
Yun Jin: Fan Er'ye used to be an opera singer when he was young, and he often performed together with Granny Ruoxin. They would usually play a couple. Perhaps Er'ye wanted it to be real.
Yun Jin: But Granny Ruoxin had feelings for someone else. Later, she grew tired of stage performance and then decided to go to Qingce Village with the one she loved.
Yun Jin: But that person didn't make it to Qingce Village with Granny Ruoxin, leaving her to live alone in the village ever since.
Yun Jin: Knowing that I often visit her, Er'ye would ask me about her from time to time.
Yun Jin: I can tell that he still cares for Granny Ruoxin. He sees the stage as a symbol of their past and thus doesn't want to tear it down.
Tea Master Liu Su: *sigh* Since the stage means so much to Er'ye, he's not gonna let us build a new one. Guess all our efforts are wasted...
Yun Jin: That's not necessarily the case. I have a way to change his mind. Give me some time, Mr. Liu Su.
Tea Master Liu Su: Really? As long as the stage gets repaired, I'll be in your debt, Ms. Yun.
Yun Jin: #I won't ask for too much. Please tell "Ring of Raining Blades" to its very end. {NICKNAME}, you can join me if you want.
Traveler: Somehow Yun Jin feels very different than usual.
Tea Master Liu Su: Our tea house has collaborated with the Yun-Han Opera Troupe for decades. Ms. Yun would naturally feel more approachable around us.
Tea Master Liu Su: No problem. I'll make some time and tell the story just for you.
Yun Jin: Alright, now that we've finished the tea, it's time to talk to Er'ye.

## Talk 9

Yun Jin: Er'ye, when we were drinking tea, I suddenly remembered what Granny Ruoxin told me.
Fan Er'ye: Oh, what did she say?
Yun Jin: She said: "Er'ye always loves to make things difficult for himself. I feel sad about it."
Fan Er'ye: *sigh* She truly understands me.
Fan Er'ye: But it seems that she doesn't miss the old stage. I'm the only person who can't let go.
Fan Er'ye: What a fool was I to be so obsessed with this stage. Alright, you can rebuild it as you want.
Yun Jin: It's a touching thing to have kept that stage for so many years. I don't find it foolish at all. Please don't think of it that way.
Yun Jin: The stage must be rebuilt, but we mustn't damage what Er'ye wants to preserve in memory.
Dayu: So you've finally made your decision? Great, I'll start working right away.
Dayu: Here, take a look at my blueprint. The grand stage on the Jade Chamber was built based on it.
Dayu: According to this design, we need to tear down the walls on the two sides, and...
Yun Jin: Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I think we need to repair the stage instead of building something entirely new. Since the problem is caused by the squeaky wood floor, why don't we repair the floor first?
Yun Jin: As for the rest, we can talk about it later. What do you think, Mr. Liu Su?
Tea Master Liu Su: So long as the stage won't affect performance, I have no objections to Ms. Yun and Er'ye's arrangements.
Dayu: Huh, is that all you want? So you don't need me to build a new stage?
Fan Er'ye: I agree. Ms. Yun's idea is a good one.
Fan Er'ye: As it happens, we don't need to buy the planks. We can find some at the docks.
Fan Er'ye: #Um... May I trouble you to bring me the planks, {NICKNAME}? I'll pay you for everything in full later.
Traveler: That works for me.
Dayu: ...Alright then, leave everything to me.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Master Lu: #{M#Young man}{F#Young lady}, I took on an apprentice today! Let me make some pork stew tonight to celebrate!

### Additional Talk 2

Fan Er'ye: Stop nagging me about repairing the stage. Let me think about it.

### Additional Talk 3

Dayu: I thought it was a serious job and even brought with me the blueprint for the grand stage on the Jade Chamber. Who would've thought that the requesters hadn't even reached a consensus? Was it just a practical joke or something?

### Additional Talk 4

Fan Er'ye: Ms. Yun really understands me.

### Additional Talk 5

Tea Master Liu Su: Just one round of "Ring of Raining Blades"? No problem.

### Additional Talk 6

Yun Jin: It's settled then. Wonderful.
Traveler: About Granny Ruoxin...
Yun Jin: I did just come back from Qingce Village, and yes, I visited Granny Ruoxin. I directly quoted what she said. It's just...
Traveler: It's just?
Yun Jin: Shh! It's just that I didn't quote the full sentence. What she said was:
Yun Jin: "Er'ye always loves to make things difficult for himself. He's stingy with Mora, and people around him suffer for it as well. It's honestly rather saddening."
Yun Jin: Although what she said was true, Er'ye would've been irritated had I repeated exactly every word, so I took the liberty of omitting the other half.
Traveler: I'll stick around a while.
Yun Jin: Great, this is my second favorite thing: to spend some time in the tea house.
Yun Jin: Even when Mr. Liu Su isn't telling a story, the mere sound of the bustling city itself is soothing.
Traveler: Then, what's your most favorite thing?
Yun Jin: It's definitely singing the opera on the stage!
Yun Jin: I'd love to chat with you more, but I believe that Mr. Liu Su is still waiting for you to bring him his planks so that the stage can get fixed.

### Additional Talk 7

Dayu: Master is right, it's difficult to work for people in cities.
