# "Owl Musician"

Alof: #Welcome to Constellation Metropole, {NICKNAME}, Ms. Paimon.
Alof: My colleagues have apprised me of your names and deeds, and have confirmed that you are valiant indeed.
Alof: Were I not in charge of training the guards, I should have liked to spar with you.
Traveler: So you're a guard yourself, then?
Alof: In sooth, I am. On the orders of our liege, we are to defend Constellation Metropole and keep the peace.
Alof: My work, specifically, is to train the guards, that their skills may prove worthy of their duty.
Traveler: So the door behind leads to the training grounds?
Alof: Keen-eyed indeed! It leads to a Domain that we just finished remodeling.
Alof: Within those grounds, the trainee must swing their blade to a specific rhythm, and the arena's lighting will constantly change throughout the battle.
Traveler: Sounds like some pretty rigorous training...
Paimon: Sounds complicated, more like... Do you have to follow that specific rhythm while fighting as well?
Alof: This part of the regimen is actually derived from a story titled "The Owl Musician."
Alof: It was popular amongst the guards some time back. Many enjoyed it to the point where they'd forget to take part in training, and their daily patrols were delayed.
Alof: But I had a thought. Since everyone liked it so much, adding elements of the story into our training would make it more enjoyable.
Alof: It has had a visible effect on training... if nothing else, there have been no further delays in our patrols due to personal reasons.
Alof: Hehe... Would the two of you be interested in said training?
Alof: The challenges within should be a piece of cake for those with valor such as yours.
Traveler: I'd love to give it a try!
Alof: Such commendable courage! Excellent. Please, then, step into the Domain.
Traveler: I've got other things going on right now...
Alof: Understandable. Come back whenever you have the time â€” I will be standing guard here.
