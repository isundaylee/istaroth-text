Sinchi: Hello. Is there anything I can bring back for you?

Traveler: How about relatives?
Sinchi: ...You misunderstood me. I'm just a regular hunter.
Sinchi: If you're looking for someone, you should probably hire a private detective, or file a commission with the Adventurers' Guild... I'm honestly not too sure either.
Sinchi: The only thing I know how to do is go on hunts with my Yumkasaurus partner. As long as you give me a target, I'll be able to bring it back for you.
