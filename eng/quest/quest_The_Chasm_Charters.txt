# The Chasm Charters


## Talk 1

Lan: Ah, it's you. Well, are you here to brave The Chasm by any chance?
Traveler: The Chasm?
Paimon: Paimon's never heard of any commission like that...
Lan: Oh, uh, you don't know about the Guild's commissions yet? Sorry, that's my mistake.
Lan: Well, The Chasm has been closed for a long time now. No one can go in without the Qixing's say-so, not even the Adventurers' Guild.
Traveler: No special pass for you guys?
Lan: Well, we wouldn't dream of being a bother to the people at Yujing Terrace. It would be a counterproductive thing to do, messing with pre-established policy like that.
Lan: Even Ms. Ganyu, who seems like the most amicable of the bunch, would probably just smile at us and say "why don't you have some tea while you wait here?"
Lan: And then she'll leave you hanging for most of the day, until you start wondering whether she'd forgotten all about you till she was nearly off from work...
Lan: Hmph, and as we all know, Ms. Ganyu never gets off work.
Paimon: Whoa...
Traveler: That certainly does sound like a very Ganyu-esque way of refusing.
Lan: Either way, this means that Ms. Katheryne isn't going to be giving out any commissions about The Chasm anytime soon. Instead, we've got to find more... convenient people to help us out in private.
Traveler: Convenient?
Lan: Yes, like for example, miners from Huishan Hall, members of the Millelith, staff at the Ministry of Civil Affairs. They can get passes to go in more easily, and...
Paimon: And... what?
Lan: Well... So what I'm saying is, O valiant hero who saved Liyue from the sea monster, yet seems to have nothing to do all day every day, surely you can talk to the Millelith on our behalf?
Traveler: No idea who you're talking about.
Lan: I'm talking about you.
Paimon: C'mon, she was definitely talking about you!
Lan: Don't play dumb. Who do you think I'm talking about, Rex Lapis?
Traveler: Hehe.
Lan: Alright, quit your bragging.
Lan: Whatever the case... You have our thanks for your help so far, and we'd like you to consider helping us again.
Lan: It's fine if the timing isn't convenient for you. It's just that... If you do end up passing through The Chasm, please help me look for a fellow named Muning.
Paimon: Muning... Who's that supposed to be?
Lan: He's a specialist sent to The Chasm by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. We've got some personal matters that need settling. You can ask him about it if you meet him there.
Lan: Just pass this message along: "You still owe Lan money for drinks. Don't you forget that." He'll get the picture.
Traveler: Got it.
Lan: Wait, hold on a moment! There's one more thing. If you take this commission up, just negotiate your payment directly with Muning.
Lan: Don't ask me why the arrangement is like this... We did this at the Ministry's insistence. Best not to question their decisions and all...
Traveler: I'll keep an eye out on the way in.
Traveler: I'll have you know that I do some important work, you know.
Traveler: They don't close one eye with you lot?

## Talk 2

Lan: You're back. The Adventurers' Guild welcomes you.
Traveler: Tell me about The Chasm...
Lan: What, you want me to tell you what's in there? Who knows, seriously?
Lan: Some say that the some miners dug up what they call "Wish Granter," but that they got the opposite of what they wished for when they wished upon it. Others say that they dug up some old dragon-king's tail down there. All tales as tall as mountains, of course.
Lan: Really, there's no point asking me about The Chasm. I'm not actually sure what happened there either. Just go ask Muning â€” this was also one of the Ministry's requirements, by the way.
Traveler: Tell me more about the commission...
Lan: *cough* Well, you can see the people who depend on The Chasm for their livelihood everywhere you go out there. I'm sure you don't mind spending time interviewing them, but I've got Guild business to attend to.
Traveler: Tell me about Muning.
Lan: Oh, him? Heh. I suspect that the Ministry sent him out to The Chasm to get him to shape up a bit.
Lan: He's pretty good at what he does, alright, but he's one cocky kid as well. You can't have that kind of flighty character in the Ministry, you know? So yeah. The Chasm might help him grow up a bit.
Traveler: See you.
Lan: Yeah, sure. Oh, right... Ad astra abyssosque!
