# Talk Dialog

Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Lisa: Aw, you're concerned for my well-being. Well, aren't you just the sweetest?
Lisa: You really know how to make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
Lisa: Don't you worry, I love it here.
Traveler: Is there any part you would want to renovate?
Lisa: Not at all.
Lisa: I think what makes this place so special is the fact that it was built personally by you.
Lisa: If I were to start nitpicking, it would only ruin your creativity and the unique charm you bring to the place.
Lisa: I certainly wouldn't want that to happen.
Traveler: Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the place?
