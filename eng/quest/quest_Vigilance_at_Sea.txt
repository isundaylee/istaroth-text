# Vigilance at Sea

Huixing: #Hello, {NICKNAME} and Paimon. Happy Lantern Rite!
Paimon: Thank you! Paimon also wishes you well!
Traveler: Happy Lantern Rite!
Paimon: Wait, how do you know us? Are you...
Huixing: I'm Huixing, the navigator of the Crux fleet. I'm also responsible for fleet-related events for this Lantern Rite.
Huixing: I heard about your stories from Captain Beidou. You guys are also brave heroes, how admirable!
Huixing: If you have any questions about the Alcor, I will do my best to give you a detailed, thorough answer!
Paimon: How nice!
Paimon: We definitely want to know more about the Alcor, and if we're curious about anything, we'll definitely ask you.
Paimon: In fact, this time, the Alcor has a lot of seaborne goods and decorations, and it's as bustling as in the city!

### Additional Talk 1

Huixing: #Long time no see, {NICKNAME} and Paimon! Happy Lantern Rite!
Paimon: Thank you, Huixing! Paimon also wishes you well!
Traveler: Happy Lantern Rite!
Paimon: We've seen that the Alcor has a lot of seaborne goods and decorations, and it's as bustling as in the city!

### Additional Talk 2

Huixing: Looking great, no? All of the decorations were handpicked by the Captain. She wanted her brothers and sisters on duty to feel like they were at home for the festival!
Huixing: Not only that, before the Lantern Rite, the Captain gave each of us a bonus and organized several big feasts.
Huixing: The food for every feast is ordered from reputable restaurants, such as the Wanmin Restaurant, which we always frequent, and Xinyue Kiosk and Liuli Pavilion.
Huixing: Everyone ate and drank their fill!
Paimon: Paimon wants to check those out, too!
Paimon: Wow, a bonus and a feast? That's great! Paimon had no idea that Beidou also had such an eye for detail!
Huixing: Actually, the Captain has always been meticulously keeping the fleet's affairs in order.
Huixing: Not only do we crew members get paid very well, but during past Lantern Rites, she's also prepared gifts for our families!
Huixing: Before, the Captain got some business information from the Tianquan on how to improve management strategy for the Crux.
Huixing: The revenue of the fleet has soared, so the Captain has also increased our pay. In this way, the crew will be in tip-top shape for any challenge.
Huixing: When the new recruits hear about how well the Crux fleet treats its crew, they'll be extra motivated.
Traveler: Challenge?
Paimon: Eh? During Lantern Rite, shouldn't everyone be on vacation? You guys seem to be... working overtime.
Huixing: It's not like that, don't worry!
Huixing: The Captain has done all the research in advance. Some of the crew were given early leave, while the others were given days off later on.
Huixing: Thus, everyone gets time off, and there will always be someone to man the Alcor!
Huixing: I was among the group that got earlier vacation time, and I came back to my post completely refreshed! I'm currently getting ready for my training examination: "Vigilance at Sea."
Paimon: Vigilant... what now?
Traveler: Is it a new challenge?
Huixing: Yup! You guessed it!
Huixing: During the past two years, the volume of seaborne trade in Liyue Harbor has been soaring, and many people have joined up as sailors.
Huixing: Taking to the high seas is a matter of patience, bravery, and perception. These are highly demanded qualities. Sailors have to be well-trained in order to navigate safely.
Huixing: In addition to obtaining the four major qualifications and the five minor qualifications, which total nine navigation-related qualifications stipulated by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, two years of maritime training and apprenticeship are also required.
Paimon: Nine qualifications and two more years of training!? Holy mackerel!!
Traveler: That's so demanding!
Huixing: It's no big deal. After all, it's far better to undergo rigorous training in preparation for work than to go out to sea and encountering an unpleasant surprise, unprepared.
Huixing: The Ministry of Civil Affairs organizes most of the training courses. Anyone with a passable knowledge of sailing could coast by them. These subjects aren't too difficult.
Huixing: Of course, some ships will also have to traverse dangerous waters, which will hopefully give them some experience.
Huixing: Given the experience of the Crux fleet in dealing with rough sea situations, we and the Ministry of Civil Affairs have organized an intensive navigation training program.
Huixing: Sailors who pass the training will get a "Deep Sea Navigation Qualification" certificate on completion, as well as some rewards prepared by the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Huixing: Considering I have the best knowledge of the surrounding waters, the Captain has tasked me with planning this training examination...
Huixing: Wait a minute. Speaking of sailing, you two are pretty good with that Waverider, no? Do you guys want to give it a try?
Huixing: If you don't mind, I would also like you guys to give me some feedback about this test, positive or negative. That way, I will be able to improve it in a timely manner!
Paimon: Well, Paimon wants to see how much skill the crew needs to navigate the high seas...
Paimon: And there's a bonus reward, too. It's a win-win for us!
Traveler: Let's give it a try!
Huixing: Such vigor! Then I'll mark you guys down for the "Vigilance at Sea" examination. Please do your best!
Traveler: Let's experience what it's like to be a sailor!
Traveler: Is it to do with the new recruits?
Traveler: New recruits?
