# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Tighnari: Me? Just thinking about some recent tasks that need to be completed.
Tighnari: This week, I have to observe some experiments and record their results at Pardis Dhyai. It's also about time to draw up the next patrol schedule for the rangers...
Tighnari: Nothing especially urgent, though, so this can all wait.
Tighnari: So? Anything in particular you want to do?
Traveler: Hmm... Nope.
Tighnari: Oh? So then, why did you ask?
Tighnari: Alright, I'll go ahead. Please answer one question for me.
Tighnari: Yes or no: Do you want to rub my ears?
Traveler: Wha... You're turning this back to me!?
Tighnari: Don't blame me, I gave you the opportunity to go first.
Tighnari: Actually, uh... I don't really mind if someone I'm close to rubs my ears, you know?
Tighnari: I'm not sure why, but everyone always seems to think that it would make me angry.
Tighnari: Over time, "Do not discuss ears or tails in Tighnari's presence" became something of an unspoken rule.
Tighnari: It can sometimes be quite amusing to watch people's faces as they stumble over their words.
Tighnari: It's probably for the best, anyway. It might get irritating if people I barely knew started coming up to me and getting all touchy-feely.
Traveler: So you're saying that I can...?
Tighnari: Of course.
Tighnari: They might not feel as nice as you're imagining, though. They honestly just feel like anything you'd find on a regular cat or dog.
Traveler: Well, I'll be the judge of that.
Tighnari: I give you an inch, so you take a mile?
Tighnari: ... *sigh* Okay, fine.
Tighnari: As long as you're happy.
Tighnari: I'd be willing to take hundreds of group photos with you, so a pat or three is nothing.
Traveler: Hehe, so about your tail...
Traveler: Ah! I'm busted!
Tighnari: Your gaze seems to have been wandering slowly earwards the whole time we've been talking.
