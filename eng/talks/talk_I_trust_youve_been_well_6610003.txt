Traveler: I trust you've been well?
Wayna: Of course, of course. Everything here has been going fine.
Wayna: What about you? Thinking about taking some risks again?
Wayna: I'd consider everything you've done to be quite risky, you know. Going to the Night Kingdom, and breaking Citlali's Spiritspeaker Stone... In my opinion, both of those are extremely important yet risky endeavors.
Wayna: It's good to have the spirit of adventure, but it can also be a double-edged sword. I know you won't like to hear this, but it doesn't hurt to be a bit more careful.
