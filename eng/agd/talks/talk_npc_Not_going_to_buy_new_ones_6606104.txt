Traveler: Not going to buy new ones?
Baret: Of course I'll get them! And I'll get as many as I want.
Baret: I've already commissioned a swimsuit in the latest style, and I've bought some limited edition designer skateboards as well.
Baret: Given it's tailored, though, the swimsuit will take some time to make, so I've got to wait a while. It's fine, though â€” chilling here and listening to music isn't a bad way to pass the time.
Baret: Everything here from the people to the music are so laid-back and carefree. I think this suits me better than mainstream rock music.
