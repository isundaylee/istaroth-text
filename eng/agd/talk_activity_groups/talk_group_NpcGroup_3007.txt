## Talk

Okazaki Rikuto: Hello there, youngster. Have you attended the festival that the Yashiro Commission and Yae Publishing House have organized in Ritou?
Okazaki Rikuto: I've heard that it's very well done indeed and that it's been very popular amongst the youngsters. Even a store run by an old codger like myself got quite a lot of customers who came for the festival.
Okazaki Rikuto: Everyone's all dressed up to nines and in high spirits, to boot.
Okazaki Rikuto: Which is good, of course, very good! It feels like Inazuma itself is growing younger once more, haha!

## Talk

Okazaki Rikuto: Youngster, are you hungry already? Come and try some of Erika's cooking!

## Talk

Traveler: And who might you be?
Okazaki Rikuto: I'm the owner of this izakaya.
Okazaki Rikuto: Feel free to order anything. Just place your order with Erika. As far as I'm concerned, her cooking is one of the best in Inazuma City.

## Talk

Traveler: I've heard that you're a real big shot.
Okazaki Rikuto: Hmm? Who told you that?
Okazaki Rikuto: Haha, Erika must have been bragging about me again.
Okazaki Rikuto: To be honest, I did have a pretty stand-up reputation when I was at the Tenryou Commission. Though I'm retired now, Yoriki and Doushin still often come to me for advice.
Okazaki Rikuto: Recently, even some major figures from headquarters have visited our store... It seems like there's something afoot in Inazuma...

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Okazaki Rikuto: Yeah, come back anytime.

## Talk

Traveler: You're the owner, and you're drinking?
Okazaki Rikuto: Why not? Sake in my hand, fine cuisine at my table... After a busy life like mine, I think I'm owed at least a drink or two.
Okazaki Rikuto: You keep up the good work yourself! And when you're the boss someday, you can live like me, too.

## Talk

Traveler: Inazuma is currently...
Okazaki Rikuto: Ah, you're still young, dear customer. What do you care about politics in Inazuma?
Okazaki Rikuto: Well, it's understandable. You are a traveler from afar, after all. It would be troublesome if you got stuck in Inazuma.
Okazaki Rikuto: If I must shed some light on the matter... the Tenryou Commission believes in the power of our Almighty Shogun. She definitely has her reasons for making her choices.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me more about Seishimaru.
Okazaki Rikuto: Oh, so you're interested in this tale, are you, youngster?
Okazaki Rikuto: I shan't hide it from you, then. Seishimaru was once a relative of mine.
Okazaki Rikuto: His tale was the talk of the town back in the day â€” not that I'd expect any young people to know of it now, though.
Okazaki Rikuto: I've lived for several decades myself and seen my own fair share of things. In truth, real life is often more exciting than fiction, hehe.

## Talk

Traveler: I still can't drink alcohol.
Okazaki Rikuto: That's because you are still young.
Okazaki Rikuto: There are also benefits to not drinking. You are still young, so there's no hurry.
Okazaki Rikuto: Let's have some barbecued skewers. They're delicious even without the drinks.
