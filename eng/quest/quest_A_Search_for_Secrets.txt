# A Search for Secrets


## Talk 1

Paimon: Whoa! Why are there so many Treasure Hoarders here?
Paimon: #Guess it's time to round up some bad guys, {NICKNAME}!

## Talk 2

Yuandai: Wait a second. If I remember correctly... I believe I brought... Ah yes, I brought some sweet snacks with me.
Yuandai: Go on, take some. You need to eat a lot if you want to grow big and strong...
Paimon: Whoa, thank you! Then Paimon will help herself!

## Talk 3

Xianyun: If one recalls correctly, the next place should be Qingyun Peak. Yuandai, how fares your health?
Yuandai: I may be a bit slow, but I'll do my best to keep up. I'm sorry to keep everyone waiting...
Xianyun: Climb on. I shall carry you to the top.
Xianyun: ...Such lightness of weight.
Yuandai: All those who grow old grow frail in the end, do they not? First, you lose your memory, then your health. Eventually, you end up losing everything.
Yuandai: My only wish is to depart this world with a lucid mind, to free myself of this torment and the burden it places upon others...
Xianyun: Fret not. You have my aid in this endeavor.

## Talk 4

Xingqiu: Time erases everything. Even the greatest of heroes will have their legacy reduced to the small fraction of their deeds that were committed to paper.
Xingqiu: But I think the magic of chivalric novels lies in the way you can catch glimpses of a noble soul from a few mere paragraphs.

## Talk 5

Madame Ping: You can taste the sweetness of the dew?
Yuandai: It's just a feeling — the sensation of stepping out into the mountains on a cool morning, gazing upon the small droplets of water hanging from the leaves, and feeling the sweet stream of water soothe a parched throat with every swallow...
Yuandai: It's a sense of calm and serenity, one that stretches on and on, until days become weeks, weeks become years...

## Talk 6

Paimon: What's wrong, Shuyu?
Shuyu: Well, I've kinda been meaning to ask ever since we started talking in the restaurant, but are you guys all... adepti in disguise?
Paimon: Oh! Uhh... About that...
Traveler: Why do you say that?
Shuyu: Well, you guys just seem super special. Plus... I think I might've heard Ms. Xianyun call herself an adeptus.
Paimon: Eh... Must have been a slip of the tongue, hehe... Xianyun, since you were the one who, uh, "misspoke," maybe you can explain to Shuyu here what you really meant by that.
Xianyun: Ahem...
Xianyun: One is indeed an adeptus. Is that of some concern to you?
Paimon: Eh!?
Shuyu: I knew it...
Traveler: You don't sound surprised at all.
Shuyu: Well... One time when I was a little kid, I saw a pure white illuminated crane.
Shuyu: I had this super high fever, and Granny wasn't around. I was feeling all icky and gross. But then, this snowy-white crane flew down from the sky!
Shuyu: She put me on her back, and flew me to her cool adeptus house, and fed me some sort of magic potion. When I woke up, I was already back in my bed, and my fever was gone.
Shuyu: I really wanted to thank her, but I was too sleepy to stay awake, so I never got the chance.
Shuyu: So, I just kinda wanted to ask if maybe... any of you have ever met an adeptus like that?
Paimon: A... pure white illuminated crane? The only two we've ever met are blue-and-white, and black-and-brown...
Paimon: Have you ever met one that's pure white, Cloud Retainer?
Xianyun: Hmph. Never has one met an adeptus with such features. One surmises such a description is but a hyperbolic embellishment that oft results from narrative accounts.
Shuyu: That's weird... Was it really just a dream, then?
Shuyu: Well, even if it was just in my head, it doesn't matter that much anyway — all I really want is to help Granny recover her memories. I'm really grateful for all your help.
Paimon: Leave it to us! Now that we know the three locations, we just need to visit them one by one.
Paimon: Let's go to Wangshu Inn first!
Shuyu: Okay! I'll go get Granny.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Paimon sees an abandoned house! Why don't we take a break over there?
Yuandai: This place... It's...
Shuyu: Did you remember something, Granny?
Yuandai: I... I remember. Shuyu... This is where your father was born.
Yuandai: It was a moonless night. I had been injured, so your Grandpa was supporting me. We fled together, with some being in the fog behind us in hot pursuit...
Yuandai: I had exhausted my strength when the labor pains came on, so we took refuge in this house. Your Grandpa set up a barrier outside, but neither of us knew if it could hold the monsters back.
Yuandai: I remember that night... I remember falling to my knees, reciting a prayer over and over.
Yuandai: I alone am the source of this sin. Punish me as you wish for forsaking my oath, but spare my innocent child.
Paimon: ...Sin? Oath? Did you do something wrong?
Yuandai: I don't know... I don't remember. I only remember praying in the darkness with all my strength, until the sun finally rose again, and the fog cleared out.
Yuandai: Eventually, the house was filled with the sound of my baby's first cries. That baby was your father. I remember... I clutched him tight to my chest and wept tears of joy. It was the first time I'd ever felt such happiness in my life.
Shuyu: My dad...
Yuandai: He was my pride and joy, and so are you, Shuyu. You're so much like him, and I love you both so much...
Yuandai: But you're... always going to be different from me. I... Why... Just what did I do?
Shuyu: I don't care what you might have done, Granny. You'll always be the person I love more than anything.
Yuandai: You're too sweet, Shuyu. I'm lucky to have you with me... If not for you, I would not have had the courage to come here, to try to remember what I've forgotten.
Yuandai: Alright, let's not stand around any longer. There's one place left, yes? Let's go take a look.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Phew, we're finally here!
Paimon: Does this place feel familiar to you, Granny Yuandai?
Yuandai: Let me see...
Yuandai: ...How strange. Have I... lived here before?
Traveler: Take it easy.
Yuandai: When we were at Wangshu Inn and the abandoned house earlier, though I couldn't remember everything, I still... felt a sense of familiarity. I could easily picture myself in those places...
Yuandai: But here... I don't have that feeling. Perhaps I did come here in the past, but it just didn't leave a strong impression on me.
Paimon: But... Did the stories get it wrong, then?
Traveler: We can't expect them to get everything right.
Paimon: Yeah, that's true... But they're also the only thing we have to go off of.
Paimon: Paimon was hoping this place would jog Granny Yuandai's memory just like the others.
Yuandai: I'm sorry to disappoint you two.
Paimon: It's alright! We're not going to give up yet! We'll figure something else out, just you wait!
Yuandai: Thank you. If only I could remember...
Yuandai: Huh? That way... What's that mountain?
Paimon: Ooh, let Paimon look — huh!? Isn't that Mt. Aocang? Looks like we've come full circle!
Yuandai: Mt. Aocang... Mt. Aocang...
Shuyu: Granny? Are you okay?
Shuyu: Don't push yourself, Granny. It's okay if you can't remember... You shouldn't do something that makes you sad...
Yuandai: Mt. Aocang. I... What am I, really...
Xianyun: Mt. Aocang holds some familiarity to you?
Yuandai: It does. But I... I can't go back...
Xianyun: Are you feeling unwell?
Yuandai: My head... It feels all heavy and dizzy. Just what is wrong with me?
Paimon: Cloud... Ms. Xianyun. Is there anything you can do...?
Xianyun: Let us go to Mt. Aocang.
Shuyu: ...But—
Xianyun: Fret not, all will be well. Yuandai, you have already given more than enough to the pursuit of this endeavor.
Xianyun: You may leave the rest to me. I've prepared something that can aid you in suppressing the fear in your heart and restoring your lost memories. It currently resides at Mt. Aocang.
Paimon: Wait, really!? When did you do that?
Xianyun: Hah, I never leave anything to chance. All will reveal itself when we arrive.
Traveler: Take your time.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Madame Ping: Leaving already? Well, just remember that you can come over for a cup of tea at any time.

### Additional Talk 2

Shuyu: Where are you going, Granny? Don't you like the food?
Yuandai: Fresh milk... I need to buy you some fresh milk.
Shuyu: Milk? Why?
Yuandai: You need to drink milk before eating, or the spicy food will make you cry. Hush, little one, don't cry...
Shuyu: Granny, you're forgetting things again! I'm not a little baby anymore — I can eat spicy food now. Even the super spicy dishes like their fish stew. I can eat two whole bowls, no problem...
Yuandai: Wonderful, how wonderful... my darling granddaughter is all grown up...

### Additional Talk 3

Shenhe: Ah...
Shenhe: I should get paid in another few days. Shall we take the opportunity to go out and have some fun?

### Additional Talk 4

Chef Mao: This is one of our busiest periods in the year... Things should calm down a little in another few days.
Chef Mao: I sure am glad to have Shenhe now. There's no way I'd have been able to cope this year all by myself.

### Additional Talk 5

Paimon: Do you remember anything about this place, Granny Yuandai?
Yuandai: Let me think... I feel like I've been here before.
Yuandai: But I don't think I stayed here too long. I might have just rested here briefly before continuing on my way.
Paimon: Got it... That's okay, there are still plenty of other places we can check!

### Additional Talk 6

Yuandai: Hmm...
Traveler: What about this place? Any memories?
Yuandai: I don't remember this place at all... I don't think I've ever been here before.
Yuandai: Still, I was thinking... This place feels perfect for a game of hide-and-seek.
Paimon: Huh? Why a game of hide-and-seek?
Yuandai: I'm not sure. Maybe it's because... I used to play that game a lot with Shuyu when she was younger.
Shuyu: Hmm, I don't remember playing it that much. Are you sure about that, Granny? We only played a few times, and we stopped once we realized I was no good at the whole seeking part.
Yuandai: Ah, is that so? Then I must be mistaken.
Paimon: Hmm, not here, then... Let's try somewhere else.
