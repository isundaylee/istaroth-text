# Talk Dialog

Jean: Of course, it's always a pleasure to be in your company.
Jean: Is there a particular topic that you wish to discuss?
Traveler: Anything, except work...
Jean: I apologize... Evidently, I talk about work so much that it gets quite exasperating for the people around me.
Jean: I will think on this.
Traveler: Jean, no need to take it so seriously...
Jean: I—I am sorry...
Jean: I understand. You mean to say that we should be more informal in the way we interact with each other.
Jean: O—Okay, I...
Jean: I will do my best...
Traveler: I've heard that you sing quite well?
Jean: ...Only a few simple songs.
Jean: It's really nothing to brag about.
Traveler: I want to hear you sing.
Jean: Ah, um... But I'm completely unprepared...
Jean: At the very least, let me practice first.
Traveler: If that works for you, it works for me.
