# Talk Dialog

Traveler: From before?
Deyin: Recently, a youth has been coming to the teahouse, telling of the most humdrum happenings in the streets, thinking to please the public.
Deyin: A joke about a Fontainian who made a fool of themselves while drinking tea here, a story about a Mondstadter who was knocked out after drinking three bowls of a local spirit there...
Deyin: While it's true that outsiders don't understand our traditions and do many outlandish things, it's better to only discuss such things over a cup of tea or after meals.
Deyin: On the stage, it's better to speak of more elegant affairs.
