# Talk Dialog

Schulz: About your master...
Schulz: You'll have spoken to Wagner before I'm sure? Bit curt, eh?
Schulz: I'd be hard-pressed to find a better mentor though. Just look at the weapons he makes, a true testament to how hard he works.
Schulz: As long as there's mutual respect between us, I can't ask for more.
Schulz: To be honest, I think Master would get lonely without me here. Last time I took a trip back home, for example...
Schulz: ...Actually, never mind. Yeah... Don't bring that one up with Master.
