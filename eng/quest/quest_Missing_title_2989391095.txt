# Missing title (2989391095)

Traveler: How's the situation?
Lorgar: It's not looking too good... The hilichurls have been increasingly active recently, it's becoming quite a headache.
Lorgar: But there's not much I can do beyond warning the adventurers and travelers around here to watch their backs.
Lorgar: Here are some notes I jotted down, maybe you'll find them helpful. Take care now.
