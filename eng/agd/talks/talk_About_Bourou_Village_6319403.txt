Traveler: About Bourou Village...
Komaki: Oh? You're asking about the village?
Komaki: There's not much to be said about it. It is simply the place where we have lived over many generations.
Komaki: It's just that this place has experienced far more history than many others... But not as much as Sangonomiya Shrine, of course...
