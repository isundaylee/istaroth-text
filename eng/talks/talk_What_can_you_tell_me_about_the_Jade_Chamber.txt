Traveler: What can you tell me about the Jade Chamber?
Baixiao: The Jade Chamber is where Lady Ningguang holds court. Here, she gathers information and makes important decisions.
Baixiao: From here, there is no matter in Liyue, great or small, that she cannot oversee. Nor can any rumor escape our ears or eyes.
Baixiao: Forgive me for being unable to say more.
