Kamisato Ayaka: These stalls look to have been quite carefully arranged.
Kamisato Ayaka: It's a little deserted here, but it's enough for us to put aside our troubles and enjoy some festive fun and relaxation. Even if it's just the two of us, and even if it's our own kind of festival.
Kamisato Ayaka: Thank you. This truly makes me happy.
