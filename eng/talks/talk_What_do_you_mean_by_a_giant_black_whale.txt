Traveler: What do you mean by "a giant black whale"?
Nantuck: Shh! Softer, please! This is my magnum opus in progress we're talking about here!
Nantuck: Well, since you seem interested, allow me to give you a sneak peek.
Nantuck: Imagine this: an epic tale on the high seas, with a heroic fisherman pursuing a giant black whale! This'll be a bestseller for sure!
Nantuck: But don't you breathe a word of this to anyone, you hear?
Nantuck: Such glorious inspiration cannot be reclaimed, should they be lost to someone else.
