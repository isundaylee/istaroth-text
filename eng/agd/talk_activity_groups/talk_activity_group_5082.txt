## Talk

Félix Yogue: Salutations to you once again, Honorary Knight, would you like to try piecing the Evermotion Mechanical Painting together?
Félix Yogue: Hmm? It seems that you have some questions for me, yes?
Félix Yogue: Aha! Are you interested in the Daydream Club, by any chance?

## Talk

Traveler: Daydream Club? What is that?
Félix Yogue: Hmm, let me think, how should I explain this... So generally, a "club" is... a loose assembly of people sharing the same interests.
Félix Yogue: But... the Daydream Club is bound by something more than "interests" — that is to say, "dreams."
Félix Yogue: However, these "dreams" are often criticized as unrealistic. So we said to ourselves, "why not just name the club 'daydream'?" And that's what we did.
Félix Yogue: As for us, the members of the club are naturally "daydreamers" holding to our "daydreams."

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me more about the members of the Daydream Club...
Félix Yogue: Ah, we are not great in numbers, but our members are all extraordinarily imaginative.
Félix Yogue: I, Félix Yogue, wish to create an energy source that can operate in perpetuity!
Félix Yogue: And I want to use purely mechanical structures to build it, requiring no materials that regular people can't handle.
Félix Yogue: Next up is Xavier, the genius artist and creator of the Film Kamera — which, by the way, is an exquisite product, I'll tell you that.
Félix Yogue: However, his hidden talents are most stirringly displayed in the Films he creates.
Félix Yogue: We believe with all our hearts that this man will become the greatest Film Maker in Teyvat.
Félix Yogue: That said, I haven't heard from him since his journey to Inazuma. Honestly, what has he been doing?
Félix Yogue: Then there's another one of us — Mr. Garcia, who's working on a Numbering Machine.
Félix Yogue: Well, he does zone out from time to time... but trust me, he's a natural-born mathematical genius.
Félix Yogue: Last but surely not least, we have the brothers, Mécantre and Babisse, with their boundless energy.
Félix Yogue: They are working on a super-sized cannon. Their schematics state that it shall fire missiles that can fly high enough to touch the stars of Teyvat... all while carrying people inside.
Félix Yogue: They are still searching for the right fuel for the project, but their "daydream" is the craziest plan I've ever heard.
Traveler: Are you... serious?
Félix Yogue: Of course! We're absolutely serious about our "daydreams," haha! I mean, isn't "Daydream Club" a perfect name for us?
Félix Yogue: If you're interested, do visit the town of Petrichor in the Court of Fontaine. That's where our members gather.
Félix Yogue: That said, if you went there now, you'd probably encounter a rather downcast pair of brothers...

## Talk

Traveler: Um... I've actually met Xavier in Inazuma...
Black Screen Text: You tell Félix Yogue about your experiences with Xavier in Tatarasuna...
Félix Yogue: Ah, fabulous, fabulous! "Tatara Tales" shall make Xavier, bless his heart, famous overnight. Mark my words!
Félix Yogue: ...But honestly, I am just really relieved. I thought he might've, you know...
Félix Yogue: That said, since things have been dealt with, why hasn't he even sent one letter back...?
Félix Yogue: Whatever, I'll send a letter back to Petrichor later to tell Mécantre the news, so that he can stop worrying...

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Félix Yogue: Farewell. Once more, I salute you, Honorary Knight.
