# Delicious Tahchin

A classic rice dish served in large quantities. With the first bite, the crispy outside cracks with delightful crunching sounds. The second bite combines the soft and moist rice with juicy meat in your mouth. Then, the third bite brings in the Padisarah's fragrance... The last bite, however, leaves your heart empty. What a pity it is, that you are too full to continue this wondrous experience. Well then, why not have another serving tomorrow?
