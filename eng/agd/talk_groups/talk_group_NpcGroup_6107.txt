Traveler: Pretty great, huh?
Hakau: Oh, you mean the pleasure of coming and going freely?
Hakau: Hmm... Do you think floating in the air is kind of like swimming in water?

Traveler: Pretty grating, huh?
Hakau: Really? Then aren't the Scions of the Canopy always like... engaging in spiritual practices every day?
