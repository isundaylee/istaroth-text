People say all kids do is cry
But when I think of you
My sweet child
All I remember is your smile
Watching the saurians ride the Spiritways
Or the feather from Uncle Chaco's hat dance in the wind
One night, as you smiled up at the stars
Your dad got lost in the sight as well
Were you drawn in by some greater meaning, I wondered
But, no. The stars were just smiling back
Aroni, stop writing, and join us!
Team Leader, give us a toast!
Okay, then...
May our homeland prosper, our friendship endure
And may this be a journey we never forget!
Shh! He's laughing!
I heard, babies that smile a lot are blessed with luck...
That's just superstition...
It's true!
None of us know the reason
Behind all those smiles...
But I think, you can sense all the love around you
Can't you?
We love you so much
May you always be my happy boy
Where did these Abyssal monsters come from?
Run!
No good, exits are blocked!
Aroni, the babyâ€”
Aroni!
My child...
Stay with me! I'm here! I'll protect you!
Leave me... Just keep him... safe...
Gods, if you can hear my prayer...
Take my body, my love, and my memories as fuel
Even if my soul is barred from the Night Kingdom
Doomed to wander the desolate wilds...
I offer up all that I am...
...That this child might live
I have no doubt, you'll meet many good friends one day
Because I know
You're the luckiest child there is
Smile for me, my darling...
Let Mommy see it... one last time
