Traveler: About the story of the "Good Shelf"...
Xudi: Oh, you'd like to hear the tale, then? Sure. Allow me to briefly introduce this widely-told tale, then.
Xudi: It is said that there was once a kingdom constructed of shelves of many colors.
Xudi: Each shelf had its own duty and objects that they would hold, but there came to be one newly crafted shelf that was dissatisfied.
Xudi: "Why does that shelf get to hold jewelry, and that other hold paintings, while I am consigned to carry expired fruit?"
Xudi: "Enough! I've had enough. I'm leaving this place. I'm going to carry things that truly show my worth!"
