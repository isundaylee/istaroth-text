## Talk 3

Traveler: About riches...
Paimon: Paimon... doesn't feel so good...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Paimon: Paimon hasn't opened a treasure chest in so long. If this keeps up...
Traveler: If this keeps up...
Paimon: Hey! Paimon floats, so that'll never work.
Traveler: You'll get caught in a hunting trap with a one-Mora bait someday.

## Talk 4

Traveler: About cat people and dog people...
Paimon: Which do you like more, cats or dogs?
Traveler: I prefer Paimon.
Paimon: Eh? Um, that... That's cheating...
Paimon: Wait, no! Paimon's not a pet!

## Talk 5

Traveler: About Language
Paimon: You learn new things so quickly.
Paimon: You've already got such a good grasp of Teyvat's language.
Traveler: You're a good teacher, Paimon.
Paimon: Hehehe...
Traveler: Who knows?
Traveler: Maybe the quality of your nasty nicknames will improve, someday.

## Talk 6

Traveler: About rock, paper, scissors...
Paimon: We should get something to eat! Aw, but Paimon doesn't wanna go over there...
Traveler: Shall we decide with a game of rock-paper-scissors, then?
Paimon: Ooh, okay!
Traveler: Alright then. Rock, paper—
Paimon: —Super Paimon Tornado!
Traveler: ...What?

## Talk 7

Traveler: About the luck of the draw...
Paimon: Urrrrgh...
Traveler: Hmm? Are there pigeons around?
Paimon: No, Paimon's just hungry.
Paimon: What Paimon needs right now is a traveler who can whip up some delicious Sticky Honey Roast.
Paimon: So, who's going to be the lucky traveler?

## Talk 8

Traveler: About Cider Lake...
Paimon: Cider Lake never freezes, no matter what time of the year it is.
Paimon: The best apple ciders in Mondstadt can only be made using the fresh water from this lake.
Paimon: It really does taste great! Paimon could drink two big bottles in a second!
Traveler: Wow.
Paimon: Tee-hee!
Traveler: With your size...
Traveler: I can't believe that you can drink that much water...
Paimon: Paimon always has room for tasty drinks.
Traveler: Huh...
Traveler: I guess the world really is a big place.
Traveler: So many things to consider...
Traveler: ...And not explode like an Anemo Slime.

## Talk 9

Traveler: About Razor
Paimon: Have you heard of the brush?
Traveler: You mean pens made using animal hair...
Paimon: That's correct! They say that finely-made brushes sell for high prices among Liyue's merchants!
Traveler: So, would you like to make some too?
Paimon: Uh-huh! But the wild wolves are too fierce, so we should use Razor's fur to make brushes instead!
Paimon: Razor's fur is all downy and soft. It'll definitely make great wolf pens! We could make lots of Mora like this!
Traveler: Brushes made like that would conduct electricity.
Traveler: Besides, Razor isn't a wolf.
Paimon: Eh? Why are they called wolf pens, then?
Traveler: Well, does Cider Lake look like it's full of cider to you?
Paimon: Hmm. You have a point.
Traveler: Nor are wolf pens made from wolves' hair...
Traveler: I'm not sure we could use them...
Traveler: ...For writing purposes?

## Talk 10

Traveler: About Benny's Adventure Team
Paimon: If you want to adventure together with Benny's Adventure Team, you have to come prepared.
Paimon: Domains are very dangerous, so you should always take care to double and triple check your supplies in advance.
Paimon: Paimon's heard that the Adventurers' Guild has compiled a list of four hundred and sixty-three different ways of dying in these domains...
Paimon: If Bennett got you killed by accident, Paimon and Bennett would never forgive ourselves!
Traveler: ...Why am I the only one dying here?
Paimon: Well, that's because according to the numbers, Paimon can avoid three hundred and twenty-two causes of death just by floating!
Traveler: I suddenly don't feel like exploring these domains...

## Talk 11

Traveler: About the "Wondermaid"
Paimon: It's time for Paimon's Little Life Tips!
Traveler: "Little Life Tips?"
Paimon: In Mondstadt, if there's something you can't fix, or something that you can't get clean, no matter what you do...
Paimon: If you ever run into something you can't handle yourself, you just need to shout this name to the skies:
Paimon: "Noeeeelle!"
Paimon: And everything that's troubling you will be swept away in an instant.
Traveler: So this is one of the tricks to living in Mondstadt?
Traveler: Pretty impressive...

## Talk 12

Traveler: About Kaeya and Diluc
Paimon: Strange...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Paimon: Diluc and Kaeya are really alike, so why don't they get along?
Traveler: How are they alike, again?
Paimon: Well, Kaeya's the kind of guy who acts shady in the light of day...
Paimon: While Diluc is a shining beacon of justice in the dark of night!
Paimon: Don't you think that's kinda the same thing...?
Traveler: Uhh... I still don't see it.

## Talk 13

Traveler: About Effort and Reward
Paimon: Paimon finds that hard work hardly works here in Mondstadt.
Traveler: Why'd you say so?
Paimon: Just look at Huffman from the Knights of Favonius. He does his best at his duties every day...
Paimon: But the ever-relaxed Captain Kaeya is his boss.
Traveler: Hmm, but isn't Jean, who works the hardest...
Paimon: W—Well, how about this, then...
Paimon: Venti's the god of Mondstadt, and he's the laziest of them all!
Traveler: ...The Acting Grand Master?

## Talk 14

Traveler: About Dihua Marsh
Paimon: Did you know? The reeds in Dihua Marsh are common materials used in making paper.
Paimon: The solid reed cores are used to make pens, while the hollow part is used to make flutes, and it's considered an elegant art in Liyue.
Paimon: Over the years, many heroes and swordmen have also chosen Dihua Marsh as the location of their duels.
Paimon: The more reeds, the more elegant the place. But in places where the reeds are the thickest, the water can be quite deep...
Paimon: So there are lots of unlucky duelists who fall in and drown while the duel is on...
Traveler: And what's my takeaway from this supposed to be?
Paimon: Don't fight!

## Talk 15

Traveler: About Couplets
Paimon: Paimon's heard that couplets are a traditional art form in Liyue. If you can write a line that works as a second half to one that someone else has written, you'll be well paid!
Paimon: But linking the couplet is hard, so it's not easy money.
Paimon: Not only does the rhythm need to match, but the meaning has to as well.
Traveler: Hmm, care to give an example?
Paimon: Uh... "Windrise's winds never churn."
Traveler: ...Um, "But the Sea of Clouds' clouds always return."
Paimon: Huh... Not bad!
Paimon: Let's not waste time here. We've got some money to make!

## Talk 16

Traveler: About Heart's Desire
Paimon: Walk in seven clockwise circles, then walk in seven anticlockwise circles, then open your eyes...
Traveler: Are you sleepwalking?
Paimon: Nope! Paimon is just trying to see if that antique shop from "Heart's Desire" actually exists!
Traveler: Well, assuming that a shop in a story does exist...
Paimon: A Slime Creator!
Traveler: Does such a thing even exist?
Traveler: What would you like to buy, Paimon?

## Talk 17

Traveler: About Beidou
Paimon: How do you become as popular and cool as Captain Beidou?
Traveler: With enough experience...
Paimon: Paimon's already seen lots of things from adventuring together with you!
Traveler: One also needs to experience trials and setbacks...
Paimon: Paimon almost drowned that one time...
Traveler: ...Maintain an inspirational disposition...
Paimon: Uh-huh! Paimon's always rooted for you!
Traveler: One must also have a mature outlook towards problems...
Paimon: Hey! Are you just trying to say that Paimon can't make it?

## Talk 18

Traveler: About Ningguang
Paimon: How does a person become as rich, or as rich, or as super rich as Lady Ningguang?
Traveler: Is that the only impression she gives you? Riches?
Paimon: Well, there's the huge Jade Chamber, too! But isn't that also made of Mora?
Traveler: Well, you need an excellent mind...
Paimon: Paimon's really good at giving people nicknames!
Traveler: You need to be very familiar with the workings of the markets...
Paimon: A serving of Fisherman's Toast goes for 1025 Mora, and no discounts even on rainy days.
Traveler: You also require exceptional workmanship...
Paimon: So... how do you make friends with a really rich person?
Traveler: Wait, you're giving up already?!

## Talk 19

Traveler: About Qiqi Being a Zombie
Paimon: Do you think that Qiqi... needs to drink blood?
Traveler: That's not a zombie, Paimon, that's a vampire.
Paimon: Then, will her arms fall off suddenly?
Traveler: That's also not a zombie, that's a ghoul.
Paimon: uh. As expected of a traveler. You really know a lot!
Paimon: So, what special thing can zombies do?
Traveler: Exercises?
Paimon: That makes a lot of sense! So zombies are the ones that can perform exercises!

## Talk 20

Traveler: About the Vision Hunt Decree
Paimon: It's hard to talk about the recent events in Inazuma and not mention the Vision Hunt Decree.
Paimon: But you don't have a Vision, so you don't have to worry about losing one.
Paimon: #On the flip side, if you are caught by the Tenryou Commission, Traveler, you also can't surrender your Vision in exchange for your life...
Traveler: I can tell them...
Paimon: Another reason to have Paimon around... Wait, WHAT!?
Traveler: Don't worry, I wouldn't let them take you, Paimon.
Paimon: That's more like it.
Traveler: We'd just go to jail...
Paimon: Uh... W—Well, if that's how it would go down, then maybe you should hand Paimon over to them...
Paimon: ...Wait a minute! How about we just don't get caught in the first place?
Traveler: And suffer punishment together...
Traveler: ...That you are my Vision.

## Talk 21

Traveler: About Gorou
Paimon: Hmm...
Traveler: What are you mulling over, Paimon?
Paimon: #Traveler, do you remember Gorou's fluffy ears?
Paimon: Paimon really wants something like that... Or maybe horns similar to the ones Ganyu has. Ganyu's horns are pretty cute as well.
Paimon: #Traveler, do you have any ideas?
Traveler: Let me see, hmm... Oh, I found something!
Paimon: #Really? Aw, Traveler, Paimon always knew you were reliable!
Traveler: Ta-da! I present to you the Tusk of Monoceros Caeli!
Paimon: Paimon doesn't need that!
Paimon: *sigh* If Paimon can't have Gorou's fluffy ears, then maybe at least something like his fluffy tail...
Traveler: Bubadada! Here you go — Tail of Boreas!
Paimon: ...Not that! Also, combining those two is definitely not the look Paimon is going for!

## Talk 22

Traveler: About Kamisato Ayaka
Paimon: Hmmm...
Traveler: Paimon, you look so serious today.
Paimon: That's because Paimon's thinking about serious things.
Paimon: Paimon's jealous of people from wealthy and influential families. They have an endless supply of Mora and mountains of delicious food to eat...
Traveler: I can't disagree. Those are exactly the things you're fond of.
Paimon: But after getting to know Ayaka better, Paimon realized that a young lady from a noble family can also have her share of hardships.
Paimon: She needs to shoulder her clan's duties and responsibilities. She works so hard and has very little time for herself.
Paimon: Ayaka must be exhausted, she should try to relax a bit...
Paimon: Ah, that's right! Let's invite Ayaka to the next festival!
Paimon: If she got an invite from us, there's no way she'd refuse.
Traveler: Yeah.
Paimon: Besides, if Ayaka's around, she can pick up the tab for us...
Traveler: ...I should've seen that coming...
Traveler: I'd like to go to another festival with her.

## Talk 23

Traveler: About Festival Traditions
Paimon: It's a well-established tradition that during Inazuman celebrations everyone's wearing festive masks.
Paimon: Paimon tried to look around the stalls, but hasn't found any mask that fits...
Traveler: So you really want a mask of your own?
Paimon: Of course! Not wearing a mask during an Inazuman festival is the same as not receiving a bouquet at the Windblume Festival...
Traveler: Let me make one for you.
Paimon: #Whoa! Traveler, you're the best!
Traveler: Hmmm, I wonder what kind of mask will fit you best?
Paimon: Yay, Paimon Slime!
Traveler: How about... a slime mask?

## Talk 24

Traveler: About Yoimiya
Paimon: Do you think Yoimiya's dad's poor hearing is related to fireworks?
Paimon: He's been making and testing fireworks for many years now, and being exposed to the sound of gunpowder explosions on a daily basis... Paimon can see how that might've worn down his ears...
Paimon: Yikes! Since Yoimiya is inheriting her family business, does that mean she'll have trouble hearing other people in the future, just like her dad?
Paimon: Paimon won't let that happen! Let's think of some way to help her!
Traveler: Do you have any suggestions, Paimon?
Paimon: Uh... Um...
Paimon: Paimon could follow Yoimiya around and cover her ears whenever needed...
Traveler: Then you'd need to leave me.
Paimon: ...Without Paimon, you'd lose your guide. Paimon wouldn't leave you like that!
Paimon: But... What should we do for Yoimiya...
Traveler: Actually...
Paimon: Oh yeah! Paimon didn't think of that solution! You're so smart!
Traveler: Heh... That was the first thing that came to my mind.
Paimon: Eh? So you knew this whole time, but didn't tell Paimon?
Paimon: How could you! You bully!
Traveler: But I wanted to give you an opportunity for a mental workout.
Traveler: She can simply wear earplugs while working with fireworks.

## Talk 25

Traveler: About Sayu's Troubles
Paimon: Sayu seems to have a lot on her mind.
Paimon: Paimon can't understand why she'd have so many worries.
Traveler: I guess this is what they call growing pains.
Paimon: Hmm, Paimon can't relate to that.
Paimon: After all, it's not Paimonly to worry too much.
Traveler: Hmmm...
Traveler: Bad news! We're almost out of Mora.
Paimon: Wh—What? Noooo!
Traveler: See, you're not as carefree as you thought.
Paimon: How could you prank Paimon like that...
Traveler: I guess we'll have to tighten the purse strings for the next few days...

## Talk 26

Traveler: About Naku Weed
Paimon: Even though Naku Weed has a flower-like structure, its "petals" are in fact leaves.
Paimon: Its actual bloom is rather fragile, so the surrounding leaves try their hardest to grow strong and protect it...
Paimon: Hee-hee, just like Paimon is protecting you right now.
Traveler: Just like you? Oh, is Naku Weed edible too?
Paimon: Yeah, that's right! ...Wait? What are you trying to say?

## Talk 27

Traveler: About Swords
Paimon: #Traveler, have you noticed?
Paimon: In Inazuma, people who wear swords on their waists are a minority. Most soldiers use spears.
Paimon: Could it be that swords are a symbol of status... Should we wear them as well?
Paimon: But the swords here are all too big for Paimon... There's no other way, we'll have to find a famous swordsmith to make a custom one!
Traveler: A custom-made sword will cost a lot of Mora though.
Paimon: Are you saying that Mora is more important than the desires of your lovely companion?
Traveler: ...Actually, I've already prepared something for you, Paimon.
Paimon: Really? Really? Let's have a look!
Paimon: Hey! Isn't that the knife we use to cut fruit?
Traveler: Well, at least it's the right size for you...
Traveler: Ahem, "What matters isn't the value of the sword..."
Paimon: Nice try, but Paimon won't fall for this, no matter how cool it sounds!
Traveler: "It's the fighting spirit."

## Talk 28

Traveler: About Canned Knowledge...
Paimon: Free knowledge without having to study at all? Canned Knowledge is amazing!
Paimon: Could Sumeru have Canned Knowledge about the different customs of the seven nations, too?
Paimon: If so, Paimon could just open a can every time we get to a new place. Paimon wouldn't have to explain things ever again!
Traveler: Or we could just open them all...
Paimon: But... but traveling wouldn't be any fun without surprises to look forward to!
Traveler: Plus, if we opened them all here...
Paimon: Okay scrap that idea! No more Canned Knowledge. Let's save our Mora for something else!
Paimon: Something like... Oh! Tipping Paimon for guide services! Heehee, seems fair, right?
Traveler: I wouldn't even need Paimon as a guide anymore.
Traveler: Here in Sumeru...

## Talk 29

Traveler: About the Eremites...
Paimon: The Eremites are a real motley crew...
Traveler: There's certainly a diverse range of characters.
Paimon: Hmmm... yeah, that could explain it! Paimon can play lots of different characters too.
Paimon: Judgy Paimon, knowledgeable Paimon, helpful Paimon...
Traveler: ...And of course the classic, completely-misses-the-point Paimon.

## Talk 30

Traveler: About the Grand Bazaar...
Paimon: The residents of the Grand Bazaar are all so talented!
Paimon: They sell their own woven goods, beautiful vases and jars, and delicious-smelling spices that make Paimon's tummy start rumbling...
Paimon: And they all sing and dance really well! Paimon wishes she could do that.
Traveler: Well, if you're serious about it, there's no reason you couldn't learn.
Paimon: What? Really?
Traveler: Well for starters...
Traveler: You won't trip over yourself...
Paimon: Oh yeah! Paimon always forgets how useful flying can be!
Paimon: Alright then! Let's go bust a move at the Grand Bazaar and watch everyone shower Paimon with admiration!
Traveler: Aha, so that's what this is all about.
Traveler: Or accidentally step on someone else's foot...
Traveler: You have a natural advantage when it comes to dancing.

## Talk 31

Traveler: About Divination...
Paimon: People in Sumeru seem to take divination and fortune-telling pretty seriously.
Paimon: For starters, there's astrology, although only the scholars get to practice that. But ordinary citizens have their ways, too. They can do divinations with just a cup of coffee!
Traveler: It's the nation of wisdom after all...
Paimon: Paimon heard that they can tell your fate just by looking at the bottom of a finished cup of coffee...
Paimon: Sounds way easier than climbing to the top of a tower and staring at the stars all night!
Traveler: Are you interested in learning your fate, too?
Paimon: Yeah... although, Paimon's really more interested in finding out what the coffee tastes like.
Traveler: It seems like people have an insatiable curiosity to learn about everything, including their own future.

## Talk 32

Traveler: About Bimarstan...
Paimon: Whoa, healthcare is FREE in Sumeru?
Traveler: Are you feeling unwell, Paimon?
Paimon: No, not right now. Thanks for asking, though.
Paimon: Hehe... Eating the street food on every corner has never sounded so tempting!
Traveler: Your stomach is going to punish you for that!
Paimon: If so, Paimon'll go see a doctor and get treated — it's all for free! It'd be a waste not to take advantage of this, don't you think?
Traveler: Maybe... but then again...
Paimon: *gasp* Oh no! So no more delicious food, then?
Traveler: That, plus the doctor would make you take the most bitter-tasting medicine ever.
Paimon: O—Okay... Maybe Paimon needs to reconsider this idea...
Traveler: The treatment would likely include a restricted diet.

## Talk 33

Traveler: About the Scholars...
Paimon: So many people in Sumeru want to become scholars.
Paimon: Motivated by this ambition, they all study really hard to try and achieve it...
Paimon: But Paimon bets that the first ever scholar didn't set out to become a scholar...
Paimon: Hmm... so what do you think the first ever scholar's ambition was?
Traveler: Probably...
Paimon: Huh? But isn't a scholar's ultimate goal supposed to be "pursuing the highest and greatest knowledge" or something?
Paimon: Paimon's sure that it must have been because of a fervent desire for knowledge that they became Sumeru's first true scholar.
Traveler: Writing papers is how you pursue knowledge.
Paimon: But what about when it's the highest and greatest knowledge of all...
Traveler: Even then, if you wanted to prove it, you'd need a research paper.
Traveler: And after that, you'd need to start working on another paper
Paimon: O—Okay, Paimon's got it! Come on, don't look so sad! It's not like you have to worry about writing papers yourself!
Paimon: ...Y—You've never had to write a paper before, right...?
Traveler: To validate your original thesis...
Traveler: To get their research paper written as quickly as possible.

## Talk 34

Traveler: About Aranara names...
Paimon: Arama, Arana, Araja, Arakavi... Whew, Aranara names are so hard to remember...
Paimon: The only bit Paimon's sure of is that they all start with "Ara"!
Traveler: Right, so if you were an Aranara...
Paimon: Yup, and as for you...
Paimon: Hmm, actually, they'd probably call you "Nara Traveler"...
Traveler: Yeah, we're all Nara to them...
Paimon: So if there was someone whose actual name was "Nara," what would the Aranara call them?
Traveler: "Nara Nara"... I guess. Sounds kinda cute.
Paimon: Hehe, yeah.
Traveler: Your name would be "Arapaimon."

## Talk 35

Traveler: About Magic...
Paimon: Lyney's magic shows are amazing! Paimon never would've guessed how he did it before he revealed his secret.
Traveler: Hold on... I just thought of a magic trick!
Paimon: Huh? You know how to do magic too?
Traveler: Yep. I can make a big magician's hat float in the air...
Paimon: Whoa! Really? How do you do that?
Traveler: Hehe, simple! I put Paimon inside the hat.
Paimon: What? Why would Paimon be... Ohhh, so Paimon's the one making it float!
Paimon: Hehe, in that case, Paimon has an idea for an even better magic trick!
Traveler: Huh? What is it?
Paimon: Behold, the bottomless hat! No matter how many plates of delicious food you throw into it, it'll never get full!
Traveler: Uh... Wait, so where would the plates go?
Paimon: Oh, good point! Umm... Oh, the hat spits the empty plates back out! Tada! Whaddya think?
Traveler: And even make it move at my command.

## Talk 36

Traveler: About the Mysterious Treasure of the Fontaine Research Institute...
Paimon: At the Fontaine Research Institute, they research clockwork and different energy sources, right? So how come there are rumors about a mystery treasure?
Paimon: It'd make more sense if the treasure was owned by a bandit or a pirate.
Paimon: But Paimon's not sure that the researchers' and technicians' definition of "treasure" is really mysterious enough to get excited about...
Traveler: Hmm... What about "researcher by day, bandit by night"?
Paimon: Umm... Well for starters, it sounds exhausting. Imagine finishing your day job, then working a whole other job all night... When would they get time to rest?
Traveler: Maybe they wouldn't need to rest...
Paimon: Ooh! A mystery treasure left by a clockwork meka who's a researcher by day and a bandit by night... Now that sounds more like it!
Traveler: If they were actually a clockwork meka in disguise!
Traveler: Does that sound mysterious enough?

## Talk 37

Traveler: About Fonta...
Paimon: Fonta tastes amazing, don't you think?
Traveler: Yep. It's so refreshing, especially when you down the whole thing in one big gulp.
Paimon: Can you buy a glass for Paimon? Paimon's always wanted to try that thing.
Traveler: What thing?
Paimon: Just buy it, you'll see in a minute!
Paimon: Glug glug glug glug...
Paimon: Ahhhhh.
Paimon: That's what those drunkards do after they clink their glasses together. Paimon's been itching to try it for ages!
Traveler: Don't imitate them, Paimon... It's not a good look on you.

## Talk 38

Traveler: About Melusines...
Paimon: Apparently, every Melusine gets their own special token when they're born. They treat it as a symbol of their very being.
Traveler: If you were a Melusine...
Paimon: Definitely a fork! To represent Paimon's lifelong mission to taste all the delicious food in the whole world!
Traveler: Not Mora, then?
Paimon: Ooh, good point... Yeah, if it were Mora, it'd mean that Paimon's destined to be a super rich person. Then Paimon could buy anything she wants!
Paimon: Hmmmmm... Argh, Paimon's so torn! Both are so tempting...
Traveler: How about a fork made from Mora?
Paimon: Wow, that's a great idea!
Paimon: Anyway, enough about Paimon. Your token would probably be... a cooking pot, to represent being Paimon's personal gourmet chef!
Traveler: No no no, my token would be Paimon.
Paimon: Aw, really?
Traveler: With Paimon as my token, everything that you have would ultimately belong to me.
Paimon: Huh... Okay sure. Friends share everything, right?
Traveler: Haha, yeah... My stuff would still be mine...
Paimon: Hey, no fair!
Traveler: Then you can have your cake and eat it, so to speak.
Traveler: What would your token be?

## Talk 39

Traveler: About Armchair Detectives...
Paimon: So apparently, some detectives in Fontaine manage to solve cases without ever setting foot outside their homes. They call them "armchair detectives"...
Paimon: That's what they call "working from home," right? Sounds pretty cushy.
Paimon: Still, how do they figure out the truth if they never even go to the crime scene? ...Oh, Paimon knows! They must be using divination.
Traveler: You're thinking of fortune-tellers, Paimon. Not detectives.
Paimon: Oh... yeah...
Traveler: In any case...
Paimon: You mean... Oh, the detective must have people collecting information for them...
Traveler: Perhaps, or...
Paimon: Huh? But... that would mean the detective gets all the credit for our hard work! Bet they make a tidy sum of Mora off of it, too! Hmph, Paimon won't stand for that. Let's go have a little talk with Detective Armchair right now!
Traveler: Maybe they post commissions at the Adventurers Guild?
Traveler: Surely the evidence isn't just dropping itself off at the detective's doorstep.

## Talk 40

Traveler: About Resolving Conflicts...
Paimon: Paimon's heard that even in Natlan, there are lots of ways to resolve conflict that don't involve contests of strength.
Traveler: Really?
Paimon: Yeah! Like, apparently, some people in the Children of Echoes settle their disputes by holding a dance-off!
Traveler: A dance-off?
Paimon: Uh-huh!
Traveler: And just dance their socks off?
Paimon: Mm-hmm!
Traveler: Until one person gets so exhausted, they can't get up anymore?
Paimon: Yep!
Paimon: ...Wait, what the... Hold on, that IS a contest of strength!
Traveler: So like, they'll mutually decide on a time and place...
Traveler: In the Nation of War?

## Talk 41

Traveler: About Ways to Make a Fortune...
Paimon: Guess what? Paimon just thought of the best Mora-making idea ever!
Traveler: Oh? Do tell.
Paimon: Just look how many people pass by this place every day. If we opened a business here, right outside the Stadium, we'd make a fortune without even trying!
Traveler: So... What would you sell?
Paimon: Uhhh... maybe... alchemical potions from Mondstadt?
Traveler: I think there's already people selling similar stuff...
Paimon: In that case, ummm... Ooh! Ores from Liyue! Yeah, we could make a killing off of those!
Traveler: Pretty sure the Children of Echoes are already in that business, too...
Paimon: Oh, yeah... Wait, Paimon's got it — rugs from Sumeru! Those'll definitely be a hit!
Traveler: Unfortunately, that's the specialty of the Masters of the Night-Wind.
Paimon: Well then... Then we'll fence the whole Stadium up! And charge an admission fee to everyone who tries to get inside, whether they're a contestant or a spectator!
Traveler: Pretty sure someone will take you into custody...
Paimon: Grrrrrrrr! Why does getting rich have to be so hard?
Traveler: Before you finish doing that...

## Talk 42

Traveler: About Ways to Make Friends With Saurians...
Paimon: Oooh, there are so many cute Saurians in Natlan! Paimon's gonna make friends with every single one!
Traveler: Oh? Someone sounds confident...
Paimon: You bet! Paimon's got it all figured out!
Traveler: Oh you do, huh? Come on then, what's the secret to making Saurian friends?
Paimon: It's really simple! First, you've gotta sweet-talk them, show 'em you mean well so they relax their defenses. Then, you gently pat them on the head — that makes them feel more comfortable around you.
Paimon: Last but not least: Get 'em some good grub! The way to a Saurian's heart is through the stomach, after all! What do you think? Solid plan, huh?
Traveler: Hmm, why do I get the feeling that...
Paimon: Would not! Paimon can't be won over by some cheap tricks!
Traveler: Huh? Oh, you misunderstand! I meant to say that...
Paimon: Hah! Flattery, really? You think that'll work on Paimon? Think again!
Traveler: But I was being sincere, Paimon!
Paimon: ...Wait, really? Sweet Madame? Oh, heck yes! Paimon could totally go for some of that right now!
Paimon: ...Uhh... What's with that smug look on your face? ...What!? Is Paimon missing something?
Traveler: Ah, how can I prove it you? With some Sweet Madame, perhaps?
Traveler: You're as cute as a baby Saurian!
Traveler: These tactics would also work really well on you?

## Talk 43

Traveler: About the Children of Echoes' Gems...
Paimon: Hey, so the valleys here are just bursting with shiny gemstones!
Paimon: You don't come across that kind of opportunity every day! Why don't we start a dig somewhere? If we're lucky, we might unearth something super valuable. Then we'd never have to worry about running out of Mora again!
Traveler: Hmm... But how would you actually know when you've hit the jackpot? Can you even tell which stones are the valuable ones?
Paimon: Um, well... As long as something's bright and shiny, then it must be worth a lot, right?
Traveler: That makes us sound just like...
Paimon: Hehe, except we're in Natlan now — so instead of "evil dragon," it's "noble Saurian"!
Paimon: #"O brave and keen Traveler, let this noble Saurian lead you to the most precious gem in the world!"
Traveler: Great! Except she can't tell which stones are the valuable ones, so how's that gonna work?
Traveler: ...evil hoarding dragons in children's fairytales!

## Talk 44

Traveler: About the Collective of Plenty and the Flower-Feather Clan...
Paimon: Paimon's heard that everyone from the Collective of Plenty is built like a bricklayer!
Traveler: Does that mean you'll become Buffmon...
Paimon: No! Paimon likes herself the way she is now.
Traveler: Okay, then what about staying with the Flower-Feather Clan instead? They're adept fliers.
Paimon: Huh? But... isn't Paimon good enough at flying already?
Traveler: Yeah, but then you'd be able to carry me when you fly.
Paimon: Nope, not happening! How would that even be possible?
Traveler: Well, if you had those muscles I talked about...
Paimon: Oh, geez, not this again... For the last time, no!
Traveler: I'm sure they could help you sharpen your skills!
Traveler: ...if you were to stay there awhile, Paimon?
