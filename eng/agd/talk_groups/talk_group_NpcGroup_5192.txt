Xing Cheng: Ugh, this is really ticking me off. She acts like I'm dragging my feet unloading the cargo, but it doesn't take that much time! What does she want me to do, toss the boxes straight down on the ground?
Xing Cheng: My tea is the most valuable cargo on this entire ship. If even a single box is damaged during unloading, I have to foot the bill, and I'm not holding out hope for any kind of reimbursement from her.
