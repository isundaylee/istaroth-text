# Reliable Helper


## Talk 1

Tsarevich: What awful luck. These Knights of Favonius are really...
Traveler: Is something wrong?
Tsarevich: Hmph! These Knights of Favonius have no sense of efficiency at all. They said that there were monsters ahead, and wouldn't let me pass.
Tsarevich: But even now, I still haven't received anything more concrete from them. What an unreliable lot...
Tsarevich: I still have so many matters to attend to. Do they have any idea how much money they're costing me?
Tsarevich: Still... Well, you look like an adventurer, don't you? How about this — would you be willing to do a little something for me? I'll pay you.
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Tsarevich: Wonderful. I love straightforward people. You will be well rewarded once the deed is done, I guarantee it.
Tsarevich: Perhaps my eyes deceive me, but the hilichurls around Mondstadt seem to have grown more numerous. Who knows what these so-called Knights are doing all day?
Tsarevich: Since you've agreed to aid me, then you can help to drive them off for me. Yet, you are only one person. Hmm...
Tsarevich: Forget it. Pick one of these areas to clean out yourself: the peak, side or foot of the mountain.
Tsarevich: It's all hilichurls no matter where you go, so there's no difference. Now go, and don't waste my time.
Traveler: How much are you offering?
Tsarevich: Hah, that will depend on the manner of your deeds. If you do well, I will see to it that you are well rewarded.

## Talk 2

Traveler: Done and dusted.
Tsarevich: So soon? In less than a minute, even! You're quite good. Quite good indeed, hahaha!
Tsarevich: Good, good. 5,000 Mora, and not one Mora less. Take it.
Paimon: "Quite good," and all we get is 5,000 Mora...
Tsarevich: Don't you get picky, now. I calculated this remuneration very carefully, and it is commensurate with the work.
Tsarevich: One must do great things to earn great rewards. If we have the chance to meet again, you can try your luck then.

## Talk 3

Traveler: That's a wrap.
Tsarevich: Dragging your feet, just like the Knights of Favonius. I gave you a minute! Did you forget, or did you not listen in the first place?
Tsarevich: No attention paid, even to such simple details... 1,000 Mora it is. Do with it what you will.
Paimon: 1,000 Mora? So little!?
Tsarevich: How much do you expect for a job done like that? This is the pay you deserve — now take it!

## Talk 4

Tsarevich: Why are you still here? Get over there! It's just a bunch of hilichurls, how long do you plan to dilly-dally?

## Talk 5

Traveler: I'll take the foot of the mountains.
Tsarevich: The foot, is it? There's not much down there, just a bunch of hilichurls. They're not much of a threat, but they are an eyesore.
Tsarevich: Go and take care of them all. For such a simple task, I'll give you... one minute. That should be enough.

## Talk 6

Tsarevich: So. Have you done as I asked?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: I'll head for the mountainside.
Tsarevich: Ah, there's some cargo of mine that I had intended to transport back and sell on the mountainside.
Tsarevich: But now, not only have the roads been blocked, but the area where I stored my cargo has also been occupied by hilichurls.
Tsarevich: Fortunately, they don't have a good eye for value, and didn't touch my goods.
Tsarevich: Now go and clear them out, and remember not to touch my cargo. Those boxes break easily.
Tsarevich: *sigh* With these roads being blocked, those goods probably can't be sold anymore...

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: Of course.
Tsarevich: Not bad, not bad. Not a box was damaged, either — you know what you're doing.
Tsarevich: Here, take this 5,000 Mora. If the opportunity comes, let us do business again.
Paimon: All that work, just for 5,000 Mora...
Tsarevich: Don't you get picky, now. I calculated this remuneration very carefully, and it is commensurate with the work.
Tsarevich: One must do great things to earn great rewards. If we have the chance to meet again, you can try your luck then.

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: It's done.
Tsarevich: Did you mishear me, or are you hoping that I'll let this slide? Huh?
Tsarevich: I told you not to break those boxes, and you broke this many? Can they even be sold at this point?
Traveler: I didn't see any goods...
Tsarevich: It was those boxes! Those were my goods! Why do you think I would stack them up outside anyway otherwise?
Tsarevich: Forget it. Forget it! I have nothing to say to attention-deficient louts like you. Here's 1,000 Mora — take it and be off!
Paimon: 1,000 Mora? That's way too little!
Tsarevich: Too little? You can't even do a simple job right, and you want more money? This is the amount you deserve!

### Additional Talk 4

Tsarevich: So. Have you done as I asked?

### Additional Talk 5

Tsarevich: Don't touch those boxes however you like. If they break, I can't sell them.
Tsarevich: They aren't worth a lot, but I still bought them with Mora — they didn't just drop from the sky into my lap.

### Additional Talk 6

Traveler: I'll go for the mountaintop.
Tsarevich: The group of hilichurls on the mountaintop are the hardest to deal with. I used to go there to relax, but now I dare not even venture close. Very unfortunate.
Tsarevich: Well, you look quite capable, so I suppose it'll be a fitting task for you.
Tsarevich: Remember, that big blockhead with the axe has to go first. Watching him walk around all full of himself just makes my blood boil.
Tsarevich: Then there's the one that waves its big shield around in your face. What an eyesore...
Tsarevich: Finally, you want to take out those with the long staves... What do they call them, again? Samachurls? Either way, they don't look so tough...
Tsarevich: In any case, get rid of them all. Get them out of my sight.

### Additional Talk 7

Traveler: That's a wrap.
Tsarevich: Not... Not bad at all, you...
Tsarevich: Forget it, I'll say nothing more. Take this 5,000 Mora. We Snezhnayan merchants always deliver as promised.
Paimon: So Snezhnayan merchants only deliver 5,000 Mora, huh...
Tsarevich: Don't you get picky, now. I calculated this remuneration very carefully, and it is commensurate with the work.
Tsarevich: One must do great things to earn great rewards. If we have the chance to meet again, you can try your luck then.

### Additional Talk 8

Traveler: It's done.
Tsarevich: ...I watched you work from the side, you know.
Tsarevich: But are you just used to doing things at your own pace, or did you not pay any heed to the order I gave you at all?
Tsarevich: Do you know? In Snezhnaya, we say that we "deliver as promised."
Tsarevich: I pay you to do things for me, and every word that I say has meaning.
Tsarevich: You did complete the task, but these results... I can only give you 1,000 Mora at most. Take it and go.
Paimon: What? 1,000 Mora? What can we even use that for?
Tsarevich: Hmph. Too little, you say? You didn't even do the job right. This 1,000 Mora is more than sufficient.

### Additional Talk 9

Tsarevich: So. Have you done as I asked?

### Additional Talk 10

Tsarevich: What misfortune. The road is impassable, my goods can't be moved, and I can't even take a good walk.
Tsarevich: What in the world do the Knights do with their time, anyway?
Tsarevich: Hmph. If this was Snezhnaya...
