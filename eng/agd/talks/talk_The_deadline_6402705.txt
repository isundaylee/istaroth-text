# Talk Dialog

Traveler: The deadline?
Jafar: Yeah, that's the last day I can submit my paper.
Jafar: I'm a night owl whose mind only works sharply at night. That means I have 50% less research time than others.
Jafar: As for during the day, if you ask me, it'd be a waste not to go out and enjoy the warm sunshine.
Jafar: I always make some time to rest and relax. My mind would become too stiff to think straight if I focused on research every hour of every day.
Jafar: Enough chit-chat. I'm going to use the remaining 50% of my time efficiently. I have to come up with something before the deadline...
