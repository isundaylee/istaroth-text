Traveler: About Stormterror...
Patton: *sigh* Honestly, that scared me to death. We don't know when Stormterror might attack again, either... but even so, I have to stand here and advertise the tavern.
Patton: I do owe Master Diluc money, so much money that I'll have to stand out here without food, drink or sleep for another forty-eight years. If I slack off now, that time will get extended.
Patton: ...I wonder if Master Diluc will clear my debt on account of the dragon's attacks?
Patton: Probably not, haha... *sobs*
