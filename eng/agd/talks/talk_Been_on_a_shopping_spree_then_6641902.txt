Traveler: Been on a shopping spree, then?
Ixkotii: How could I not? I thought that applying to leave Natlan on the grounds of making money was never going to work, but the chief approved my request without delay.

Ixkotii: Rather than selling my own wares, I'm now far more interested in picking up as much as I can to take home with me when I leave.
