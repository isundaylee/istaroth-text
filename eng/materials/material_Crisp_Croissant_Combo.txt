# Crisp Croissant Combo

A small pastry-and-coffee combo. Roll and fold the dough, lather it in egg wash, and place the creation into the oven. Soon, it will have expanded into an exquisite pastry, piping hot as it triumphantly exits the oven. It is said that the act of brushing the egg wash on is like a baker's signature â€” and it seems this one has fine penmanship indeed.
