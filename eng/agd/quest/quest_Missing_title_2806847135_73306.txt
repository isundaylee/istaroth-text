### Additional Talk 1

Tirzad: ...Oh, it's you. Is there anything else you want to discuss?
Traveler: Let's talk about Jebrael.
Tirzad: To think that I remained doubtful of him until the end. I'm such an awful person...
Tirzad: Now, all I have for him is gratitude...
Tirzad: I've never been able to commit before this, whether in academics or in life... But that ends now. I will take the path I believe in, no matter how difficult it may be...
Tirzad: This is the least I can do to pay my respects to him...
Traveler: I want to talk about King Deshret.
Tirzad: To be honest, I'm starting to doubt the credibility of the articles I've read...
Tirzad: That prayer... It gives me a strange feeling that I can't put a finger on. And Samail too... What he said... I think I should study it further once I get back.
Tirzad: Of course, my main mission is still to write my paper like I originally planned.
Traveler: Let's talk about Jeht for a moment.
Tirzad: *sigh* I, too, wish that I could do something for her, but...
Tirzad: I can't...
Tirzad: And she refuses to say anything. If she would just speak her desire, I would be willing to do anything in my power to help her...!

### Additional Talk 2

Jeht: Sorry... I'm still not very good at controlling my emotions.
Traveler: Don't apologize.
Paimon: Yeah... We know you're going through a tough time.
Jeht: Thank you... May your travels be smooth.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon hopes that everything will go well for you too... Paimon's sure it will!

### Additional Talk 3

Bonifaz: Where are Omid and Mirsad? Are they...
Nachtigal: Don't worry. They're both fine. It's just that... they have other plans so they won't continue working with us.
Bonifaz: Huh? What do we do? We can't handle all the work with only the two of us. We've gotta hire more people! But who'd want to come to Aaru Village...
Bonifaz: Forget it, let's discuss this later. Anyway, Cyrus got back safely. That's at least something to be happy about, right? I'm never letting it go to such a dangerous place again.
Nachtigal: What are you talking about? We're Sumpter Beast merchants. What are we going to eat if our Sumpter Beasts don't work?
Nachtigal: You can't simply fill your belly with wind. Even if you could, open your mouth here, and I guarantee that you'll get a mouthful of sand instead...
Bonifaz: But we can't let Cyrus take risks. You look pretty strong to me, so why don't you carry our goods instead?
Nachtigal: ?
