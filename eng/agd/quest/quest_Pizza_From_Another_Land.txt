# Pizza From Another Land


## Talk 1

Kiminami Anna: *sigh* What am I to do...
Traveler: What happened?
Kiminami Anna: Traveler? Great, you have perfect timing!
Kiminami Anna: Do you remember the recipe you wrote for me the last time, when you and Ms. Kamisato came to my store?
Kiminami Anna: Oh, that pizza was so popular that many customers came to the store to order it specially.
Kiminami Anna: But... some customers also said that they were bored of eating this pizza all the time and asked if I have other pizza flavors.
Kiminami Anna: Although I have tried several methods to make new types of pizza based on feedback from customers...
Kiminami Anna: But I always feel... that something is lacking, and the response from customers is not very good.
Kiminami Anna: *sigh* Maybe I'm really not good at making pizza...
Kiminami Anna: Traveler, you know a lot about this dish, right? Can you give me some advice?
Traveler: You got it!
Kiminami Anna: Great! By the way, I've also collected feedback from customers. Give me a moment, I'll look for it.
Kiminami Anna: Miss Rie said that although the taste of this pizza is not bad...
Kiminami Anna: But she felt that the pizza would taste better if it incorporated some of Inazuma's local ingredients.
Kiminami Anna: I wonder what ingredients she would like to see... Traveler, please help me ask her.
Traveler: About the customers' feedback...
Kiminami Anna: Do you want to take a look at the customer feedback?
Kiminami Anna: Give me a moment, I'll look for it.

## Talk 2

Rie: Oh, hello. Can I help you with something?
Traveler: About Kiminami Restaurant's pizza...
Rie: Oh, that pizza tastes really good.
Rie: But...how do I put this, I'm not very used to its flavor.
Rie: I just think that if you can mix some of Inazuma's local ingredients into the pizza, such as Lavender Melon...
Rie: Maybe, the pizza will be more popular with everyone.

## Talk 3

Kiminami Anna: Traveler, you've returned.
Kiminami Anna: How did it go, any feedback?
Traveler: About the customers' feedback...
Kiminami Anna: Pizza made with Lavender Melon... That's not too complicated...
Kiminami Anna: The rest of the ingredients just need to be prepared as usual. Well, since the feedback said to "incorporate some of Inazuma's local ingredients," then I can add some other ingredients...
Kiminami Anna: Hmm, Sea Ganoderma? Naku Weed? Oh, how about Fluorescent Fungus...
Traveler: Umm, need some help?
Kiminami Anna: Oh! I'm sorry, I was busy thinking about what ingredients to put in! Let's see, I don't think there's much Lavender Melon left in the store...
Kiminami Anna: Traveler, please help me get a Lavender Melon. When it comes to ingredients...this should be all that's missing.
Traveler: I'm on it.
Kiminami Anna: Mm, I'm counting on you, then. Just one Lavender Melon will do.
Traveler: Do you need other ingredients?
Kiminami Anna: There are still some other ingredients in stock in the store. Just bring back a Lavender Melon, please.

## Talk 4

Kiminami Anna: Have you brought the ingredients back with you?

## Talk 5

Kiminami Anna: Thank you, these ingredients will do.
Kiminami Anna: I wonder what a pizza made with Inazuma's local ingredients would taste like...
Kiminami Anna: It's done!
Kiminami Anna: This pizza looks... pretty good...
Kiminami Anna: Thanks for your help, Traveler. Here, these are for you.
Kiminami Anna: I'll make sure to savor this pizza's taste...
Kiminami Anna: If it's not bad...it should be officially launched as a new dish soon.
