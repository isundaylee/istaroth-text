Paimon: This should be the place Miko mentioned, right?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: #Traveler, Paimon!
Paimon: Mizuki! That was quick...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: All thanks to you two. With what I learned from those two guys, I managed to give Murasaki and Shion effective treatment as soon as I got back. That meant I was free to head out again as soon as I received your message.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: So. This is where Emura Ichigensai lives?
Paimon: Sure hope so, 'cause this is our only lead... *sniff* Wait, do you guys smell that too? Some kind of fragrance. Seems like it's coming from inside!
Traveler: I smelled the same scent yesterday, too.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Then that confirms it: We've come to the right place. Now, we may face great danger once we're inside...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: So from here on out, stay close to me, and stay focused. I don't want either of you getting hurt.
Traveler: Don't worry about us.
Paimon: Mm-hmm! We'll be fine â€” you just focus on what you need to do.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Alright, fine... I suppose you're used to leading the charge.
