Traveler: Sergeant?
Fengyan: It's just a title. All it means is that I had more of a knack than my comrades for unarmed combat, so I was tasked with teaching martial arts to the new recruits.
Fengyan: Your eyes... they remind me of a soldier I once trained. He was on track to take over from me...
Fengyan: ...Unfortunately, he died in a tragic accident. I had planned to personally present him with this flower on the day of his promotion to Sergeant, but I never had the chance...
Fengyan: Sorry, that was more than you needed to hear. Please, take the flower, I feel it'll make up for it all somehow.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me more about the Millelith.
Fengyan: "While rock stays hard, the mountain shall never fail; while the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail."
Fengyan: The Millelith is the successor to the Millelith Brigade that served long ago during the Archon War.
Fengyan: Today, the Millelith rarely encounters any truly evil forces of the kind we are sworn to defend against. But we serve with the same rock-solid commitment as our predecessors did.
Fengyan: You may find on a day-to-day basis that some in our ranks fail to display the level of military discipline you might expect. But rest assured that if a truly diabolical threat ever did present itself, every last one of us would fight tooth and nail to protect Liyue.

## Talk

Traveler: What are you doing?
Fengyan: I am in charge of patrolling the area around Yiyan Temple. This is where we hold the Rite of Descension, so we must pay special attention to safety measures.
Fengyan: When I was young, I accompanied my father to take part in several Rites, in order to see Rex Lapis' true appearance.
Fengyan: The majesty and divinity of Rex Lapis at the rite made a deep impression on me, one that stayed with me my entire life â€” from my personality to the path I've chosen in life.
Fengyan: Ugh, look at me. One slip of the tongue, and I end up saying so much... If you see anything unusual, please feel free to let me know.
