Traveler: Three hundred Mora...
Hopkins the Marvelous: Huh, you find that expensive?
Hopkins the Marvelous: H—How about this, then. If you purchase this holy water I have here, it'll come with an extra mystical chalice!
Hopkins the Marvelous: Drinking the holy water through this chalice increases its effects greatly!
Hopkins the Marvelous: So buy it, buy it now!

Traveler: Sorry for bothering you.
Hopkins the Marvelous: Three hundred Mora's a bargain! Wait, don't go! Waaait!

Traveler: And you are...?
Hopkins the Marvelous: Who am I? I am one who the God of the Spring has put here specially to make miracles happen for people just like you!
Hopkins the Marvelous: You can call me Hopkins the Marvelous.

Traveler: How do I get this power...?
Hopkins the Marvelous: Just drink this bottle of holy water and the God of the Spring will reveal divine mysteries to you!
Hopkins the Marvelous: Who knows, with any luck you might even get a Vision!
Hopkins the Marvelous: And how could you not want a Vision? Just three hundred Mora for a bottle...

Hopkins the Marvelous: This is the opportunity of a lifetime —a thousand lifetimes, even! You're just going to walk away from it? Seriously, listen...

Hopkins the Marvelous: AAAAAARGH!!! *heavy breathing*... That— that was terrifying!

Traveler: What are you up to?
Hopkins the Marvelous: Oh, um... I... I was having an epiphany from the God of the Spring!

Traveler: You're just drinking normal spring water...
Hopkins the Marvelous: What? Nonsense! Hogwash! Claptrap!
Hopkins the Marvelous: You see only the physical form. After passing through the hands of Hopkins the Marvelous, it is normal no more!
Hopkins the Marvelous: If you don't believe me, buy this bottle and see for yourself!

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Hopkins the Marvelous: Okay... But you must never tell anyone about the things you saw here today... Or you'll incite the wrath of the God of the Spring!
Hopkins the Marvelous: ...And um... also, how about if you don't tell anyone I'll give you a discount next time you're here?

## Talk

Traveler: How do I become more powerful?
Hopkins the Marvelous: See this holy water I have here? Drink just one bottle, and you'll feel rejuvenated and more powerful than you could've ever imagined, guaranteed! It might take a while for the effects to kick in though...
