Traveler: Why?
Leong: The tea leaves in our village are picked and sold collectively, and the profits are distributed later on, per our contracts.
Leong: All the bosses have signed an agreement with the village. Right now? The best part of the best batch of tea should have been sold out a long time ago.
Leong: The ordinary tea farmers are only left with some surplus for private consumption now. That stuff's not bad, but I wouldn't call it fit for a gift.
