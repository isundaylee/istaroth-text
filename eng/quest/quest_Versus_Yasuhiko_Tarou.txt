# Versus Yasuhiko Tarou

Yasuhiko Tarou: I greatly look forward to this duel. I wonder what the extent of your skills is.
Traveler: Uh, what are you doing here...
Yasuhiko Tarou: Actually, when I said previously that 4 warriors had joined, I was including myself in that list.
Yasuhiko Tarou: I'm the organizer, yes, but there were just too few participants...
Yasuhiko Tarou: And anyway, I was born for combat! Since there is a mighty foe before me, I must have my duel!
Yasuhiko Tarou: ...Hehe, I've been waiting to say that for a long time now!
Paimon: Uh, Paimon's not sure this person is right in the head.
Traveler: Best not to underestimate him all the same.
Yasuhiko Tarou: Exactly! Your desire to show no partiality to your foes fills me with respect for you!
Yasuhiko Tarou: Previously, if I had not looked down on our fourth contestant, I would not have suffered such a terrible defeat.
Yasuhiko Tarou: #But the man I am today is not the man I was yesterday! Come on then, {NICKNAME}, let us duel!
Traveler: Let us cross swords.
Yasuhiko Tarou: Bring it on.
Traveler: Give me a second to prepare.
Yasuhiko Tarou: I understand. Take your time to prepare.
