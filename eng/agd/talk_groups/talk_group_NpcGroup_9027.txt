Traveler: How do you like it here?
Ningguang: This is a comfortable environment, a good place to be calm and gather one's thoughts.
Ningguang: Much like the days in the Jade Chamber...
Traveler: Surely this place doesn't compare to the Jade Chamber...?
Ningguang: Oh, you misunderstand.
Ningguang: An environment can't be judged purely on its size or opulence.
Ningguang: I sense the time and effort that you have put into this place, which reminds me of the time and effort I myself spent when constructing the Jade Chamber.
Ningguang: Or, to put it another way, I see this as the "Jade Chamber" that belongs to you.
Traveler: You're too kind.
Ningguang: Please. Kindness has nothing to do with it.

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Ningguang: A chat? Is there some commercial matter you wish to inquire about?
Traveler: N—No... just a simple chat.
Ningguang: Hmm, interesting... so many merchants and business magnates, vying to invite me to dinner.
Ningguang: And you wish to have a "simple chat"?
Traveler: I don't think I could afford the dinners they're buying.
Ningguang: Haha... Ahh, you make me laugh.
Ningguang: These people... they send me the most extravagant gifts...
Ningguang: ...But all they're really after are my words... any morsel of information that may hint at Liyue's future commercial trends.
Ningguang: Which makes the prospect of a carefree, honest chat here with you... all the more valuable to me.
Ningguang: For it is something that Mora cannot buy.
Ningguang: So, stay with me a while, and let's chat about the simpler things in life. Anything at all.
Traveler: We can talk about anything you like.
Ningguang: ...You really are quite different from the rest.

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Ningguang: As a matter of fact... there is something I've been planning for a while now.
Ningguang: The next time we have an important policy decision on our hands, I'd like you to get involved.
Traveler: To help collate paperwork?
Ningguang: Not exactly... I was thinking that you would be involved in the decision itself.
Traveler: Am I up to that...?
Ningguang: Rest assured, I am not prone to misjudgment.
Ningguang: The fount of knowledge and boldness of spirit that your travels have bequeathed upon you are sure to imbue your policies with rare and valuable foresight.
Ningguang: I have no doubt.
Ningguang: Oh, that reminds me.
Ningguang: After the decision is made, if you could please shred any documentation that accumulates on the wall during the process.
Ningguang: Liyue is due another paper snowstorm. This time, you will be the one to change the prevailing weather.
Traveler: I will rise to the challenge.
Ningguang: I like your boldness of spirit.
Ningguang: The world of commerce is a battleground, and policy-making requires conviction and decisiveness.
Ningguang: All that you have experienced during your travels is sure to imbue your policies with rare and valuable foresight.
Traveler: I will give it my all.
Traveler: To study the thinking behind policy-making?

## Talk 9

Ningguang: I have observed Liyue from the Jade Chamber for years — every building and every tile is etched into my memory.
Ningguang: I cannot sense the slightest feeling of discord from this street... It is quite a rare find indeed.
Ningguang: Your ability never ceases to surprise me...

## Talk 10

Ningguang: This is a fine study.
Ningguang: The books here are considered quite rare. And those material catalogs from Mondstadt, hmm... perhaps they might provide some competitive market advantage.
Ningguang: If I had to say one thing, it would be that the decorations are a little simple. It wouldn't hurt to consider adding more... presentable articles of furniture.
