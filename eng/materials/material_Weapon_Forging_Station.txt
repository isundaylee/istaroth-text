# Weapon Forging Station

A detailed step-by-step blueprint for making a "Weapon Forging Station."
A fully-equipped blacksmith's that can accommodate the work of many smiths at once to produce the greatest number of high-quality weapons or repair damaged weaponry most efficiently.
As long as monsters still exist on this continent and the wayfaring footsteps of adventurers do not cease, weapons and equipment will always be in demand. To meet this demand, smiths must be trained over many long years, and given that some duds will be produced during this training, it can be quite a huge expense. As such, blacksmiths will at times be strapped for cash, during which the Knights of Favonius will try to secure orders for them to help maintain their quality of life. Rumor has it that a certain farsighted winery owner has also provided some timely injections of capital in the past.
