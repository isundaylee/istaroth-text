Chen the Sharp: Hey there, are you here to sight-see and have some fun? If you're hungry, wanna grab a couple of freshly-grilled Tiger Fish?
Chen the Sharp: Even the adepti love it! Get it while it's hot!

Traveler: Tell me about the Guhua Clan.
Chen the Sharp: Ah, the mere mention of it takes me back. I do wonder what everyone's doing these days, you know, my master and all the others I trained with...
Chen the Sharp: As for me, I'm more than happy that I can combine keen bladework with the kitchen arts to bring my customers a delicious, piping-hot Grilled Tiger Fish every single time.
Chen the Sharp: Thanks for stopping by. It's been a while since I had such an in-depth conversation with someone...
Chen the Sharp: This is the sword I used to use back in the day. I doubt I'll be getting in any more sword fights again in the future, so why don't you take it off my hands?

Chen the Sharp: Tiger fish! Get it while it's fresh and hot!

## Talk

Traveler: How're the fish selling?
Chen the Sharp: Only about 1,800 sold. I'm proud to say my tiger fish is the most authentic in all of Liyue.
Chen the Sharp: I mean, at least half the city's barbeque fish is sourced from here, so if mine's no good, then nobody's is. Haha.
Chen the Sharp: As for how I can sell this much? Well that comes down to my Guhua bladework — descaling, gutting — a few quick swipes and it's all over.
Chen the Sharp: Yup, I'm from the Guhua Clan. Ten years training in seclusion. First thing I ate when I got out was this fish...
Chen the Sharp: Some say it's a waste of my talents being here, but can't say I agree.
Chen the Sharp: Our founder taught that the noblest martial virtue is to pursue that which benefits other people. I figure that as long as I do a good job, surely using my skills to fillet fish is something I can be proud of?

## Talk

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Chen the Sharp: Oh, I still can't believe it.
Chen the Sharp: Can't believe he went out like that. If my father and grandfather were still alive, I have no idea what it'd do to them.
Chen the Sharp: Sadly, as far as my children and their children will be concerned, the legacy of Rex Lapis will live on only in stories...

## Talk

Traveler: See you later.
Chen the Sharp: Be sure to come again! I'll always be here.

## Talk

Traveler: I'd like to buy a snack.
Chen the Sharp: Sure thing! Fresh and piping hot, coming right up. Mind you don't burn your tongue!

## Talk

Chen the Sharp: All this walking around working up your appetite? Why not curb your hunger with a freshly grilled Tiger Fish?
Chen the Sharp: As it happens, this year's Mingxiao Lantern commemorates Skybracer; back in the day, grilled Tiger Fish was his favorite.
Chen the Sharp: This year's Lantern Rite experience isn't complete until you've tried one!

## Talk

Traveler: Do you say that every year?
Chen the Sharp: Haha... Yes, I do! I say the same thing every year, but I'm never lying.
Chen the Sharp: It says so in the Historia Naturalis Liyue: a thousand years ago, all the adepti loved eating grilled Tiger Fish...

Traveler: Goodbye.
Chen the Sharp: If you get peckish when you're browsing around Xiao Market, come and find me!
