# Just Wushou Dance!

Xiaqing: #Yo, Happy Lantern Rite, {M#my dude and dudette!}{F#dudettes!}
Xiaqing: Say, you two wouldn't happen to be the bigshots who came looking for Gaming, would you?
Paimon: We saw you before! You were hanging out with Gaming, right?
Xiaqing: Totally! Hot diggity, you remember me! My luck's on fire!
Xiaqing: I heard you two are the best of the best, and there ain't nothing you can't do! I pop on over to Chihu Rock to buy groceries every day, and even though it's so close by, I still always hear people singing your praises along the way.
Traveler: That's right, we're the cream of the crop!
Paimon: Hâ€”Hey! Paimon's good at stuff besides eating, too!
Paimon: Wait, let Paimon think for a moment... What else is she good at...
Xiaqing: I've got it! Can ordinary people float? You're so white and light and fluffy, like a pigeon adeptus!
Xiaqing: Flying alone is amazing. I mean, it should be super easy to carry stuff, and makes work a cinch! You should help your friend more.
Traveler: Gasp! You're the Pigeon Adeptus, Paimon?
Paimon: #Let's just ignore whether it's even possible for a pigeon to turn into an adeptus for now. Paimon just wants to point out that she's always been helping {NICKNAME}!
Paimon: #For example, if {NICKNAME} falls from a really high place, Paimon will grab onto {M#him}{F#her} and make sure the fall isn't too painful...
Paimon: #Even though Paimon's not strong enough to actually do much lifting... If Paimon really was a Pigeon Adeptus, she'd give {NICKNAME} a boost while {M#he's}{F#she's} using the wind glider and help {M#him}{F#her} fly higher and farther!
Xiaqing: You two gotta practice more! Just like when I practice Wushou with Gaming. The more you practice, the better you'll work together! Rapport ain't easy to build.
Xiaqing: It just so happens I've created a fresh new game, hot off the press! It's called "Just Wushou Dance!" Wanna have a go?
Xiaqing: Not only can you work on your teamwork, you can learn all about Wushou Dance!
Paimon: "Just Wushou Dance!"? You wouldn't happen to be talking about that big ol' doll next to you, right?
Xiaqing: Bingo!
Xiaqing: Authentic Wushou Dance is downright devilish to learn! Even if you've got a pro showing you the ropes, you won't be able to stick with it unless you love it and have got the perseverance to match.
Xiaqing: So, I changed the rules for one style of Wushou Dance, switched out some props, and boom! This game was born.
Xiaqing: And it's also Lantern Rite now, yeah? Perfect for helping everyone enjoy themselves, and work up an appetite or work off the extra calories!
Xiaqing: Just put on your dancing shoes... well, the dancing outfit, and see who can grab the most teabricks! You can dance and bump all over the shop, it's a hoot and a half!
Paimon: It sure sounds fun, but Paimon doesn't think she's strong enough to wear such a big outfit and play with other people...
Paimon: #But {NICKNAME} is really good at games like this! Paimon'll watch and learn from the sidelines first.
Traveler: #Bring it! I'm the dancing {M#king}{F#queen}!
Xiaqing: Huh? Pigeon Adeptus, will you not personally participate? A pity...
Paimon: #Aw, it's not a problem! {NICKNAME} and Paimon will be traveling together for a long time to come! We'll have plenty of chances to level up our teamwork!
Paimon: #Also, who's to say Paimon won't learn a bunch about working with {NICKNAME} just from watching?
Xiaqing: Haha! You two are so close, I'm starting to get a bit jelly!
Xiaqing: #Then please, right this way! Let the {M#dude}{F#dudette} of legendary deeds step right up and "Just Wushou Dance!" Pigeon Adeptus, you just sit back and enjoy the show!
Traveler: Tea-riffic! Those Teacakes will be a piece of cake!
Traveler: Here comes another strange nickname for Paimon!
Traveler: Paimon's the best at eating, ain't nothing she can't swallow!
