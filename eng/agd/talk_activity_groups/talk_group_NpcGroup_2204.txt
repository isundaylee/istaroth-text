Smiley Yanxiao: *sigh* What should I do...?
Traveler: What's wrong?
Smiley Yanxiao: Ah, it's you. Nothing's wrong... except I might need to start looking for a new job soon.
Smiley Yanxiao: The other day, the innkeeper asked me to prepare a new dish that would attract more guests.
Smiley Yanxiao: It should be presentable and tasty, but also stylish and artisan. Oh, and have personality...
Smiley Yanxiao: I've been trying to come up with something satisfactory over the last week, but the innkeeper didn't like any dish I came up with.
Traveler: What did you make?
Smiley Yanxiao: I gave it all I had, really. I utilized everything I learned while honing my culinary skills in the mountains.
Smiley Yanxiao: Candied Silk Flower, Qingxin and Lotus Seed Duck Stew, Crab Roe Stewed Meatballs...
Smiley Yanxiao: ...But he would shake his head at everything and ask me to give it another thought.
Smiley Yanxiao: But I've already reached my limit, eh...
Smiley Yanxiao: Ah, right! I still gotta cook something for that freeloader. It's about time he came around...
Traveler: Do you mean Jiangxue?
Smiley Yanxiao: Unless you know of any other parasites who'd shamelessly come here every day asking for food...
Smiley Yanxiao: Since you're already here, why don't you grab a bite too? You can sit over there. I'll serve the food when it's ready.
Smiley Yanxiao: Haven't you already reached your limit?
Smiley Yanxiao: At least he isn't as picky as the innkeeper. A few regular dishes should be enough for him.

Smiley Yanxiao: What do you think you're doing? You can't just waltz into the kitchen whenever you feel like it!

Traveler: ...Wh—Who are you?
Smiley Yanxiao: I am Yanxiao, a sous-chef.
Smiley Yanxiao: Unless you have something seriously urgent to tell me, you'd better get out of my kitchen.
Traveler: ...Just a sous-chef?
Smiley Yanxiao: What's the big deal? Didn't you see me chopping meat and making a soup?
Smiley Yanxiao: You're not the first person to show surprise at me working as a chef, though.
Smiley Yanxiao: My story goes like this: I actually used to be a thief until I stole from the boss.
Smiley Yanxiao: I took a beating for it and was locked up for a while.
Smiley Yanxiao: After I got out, the boss took me on to help out in the kitchen.
Smiley Yanxiao: I find I'm much happier as a sous-chef than I was as a thief.
Smiley Yanxiao: I feel like this is the real me.

Traveler: Bye-bye.
Smiley Yanxiao: See you later. Wait no — don't come back in here!

Smiley Yanxiao: Huh? What are you doing just sauntering on into the kitchen?

## Talk

Traveler: Oh, sorry...
Smiley Yanxiao: It's fine. Kindness should be repaid in kind and however it goes.
Smiley Yanxiao: I'm hardly about to kick you out, not after you helped me with that ghost problem and all.
Traveler: Tell me a bit about your life to date.
Smiley Yanxiao: What're you asking that for? Aren't you here to cook?
Smiley Yanxiao: You're not the first person to show surprise at me working as a chef, though.
Smiley Yanxiao: My story goes like this: I actually used to be a thief until I stole from the boss.
Smiley Yanxiao: I took a beating for it and was locked up for a while.

Traveler: How've things been going lately?
Smiley Yanxiao: Pretty good. Ever since then, I've stopped seeing anything weird.
Smiley Yanxiao: But even if something pops up again, I'll be fine. The boss met an exorcist called Chongyun through some friends.
Smiley Yanxiao: If another ghost pops up, we'll call him in. Besides, they say he's pretty good at his job.
