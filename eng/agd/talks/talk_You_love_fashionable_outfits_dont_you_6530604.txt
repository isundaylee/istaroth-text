Traveler: You love fashionable outfits, don't you?
Flo: Sure do!
Flo: Lovely clothes with their own sense of style can sometimes even give their wearers confidence in their beauty. It's a wonderful thing.
Flo: People who are able to design such clothes are awesome. I, too, really love sewing and design work.
Flo: Sometimes, when I see the beautiful clothes worn by people in the city of Fontaine, I think, "Ah, if only I could put something similar on!"
