Jifang: How could this be...

## Talk 3

Jifang: Hmph, that's what I think about when nobody's buying books. I won't let you win that easily.

## Talk 4

Jifang: So... are you gonna buy a book or not?

## Talk 5

Jifang: At your skill level, you should play more!

## Talk 6

Jifang: Guess everyone's interested in history now, eh...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Jifang: A lot of people have become interested in Liyue's history recently, and many of them have been coming to my store to buy books...
Jifang: In the past, it would take half a year to sell the few copies of "Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti" that we had, so I stopped importing such obscure history books...
Jifang: But after the recent events that happened here, people from all over the city would come here to purchase history texts...
Jifang: These past few days have been full of customers who specifically wanted books containing Rex Lapis' stories.
Jifang: *sigh* Who knows if they really love reading, or if they're just looking to inject a bit of spice into their daily chatter...
Jifang: Due to the surge in demand, I've almost had no time to attend to some special orders that we've gotten from old customers.
Jifang: I finally found the time to put together the books that two such customers wanted, but I'm too busy to leave the store at the moment.
Jifang: Could you help me send this copy of "Verses of Equilibrium" to Uncle Tian, and this copy of "Rex Incognito (IV)" to Gentry De'an?

Traveler: I'll do it.
Jifang: Thank you very much. They must surely be growing impatient by now. After all, they placed their orders a long time ago, but I've only just gotten around to putting those orders together...
Jifang: *sigh* With so many customers all of a sudden, I barely know how to keep up...

Traveler: I'd love to, but I have to get going.
Jifang: No problem. I'll look for someone else to help me out.

## Talk 9

Traveler: "Records of Jueyun"?
Jifang: You seem like you could handle it. See what you think of this one: Records of Jueyun - Stone Beasts.
Jifang: Take it with you if you want. Just bring it back when you get sick of it.
Jifang: ...I won't hold my breath, though, I've had plenty of customers who borrow books and don't return them.

Traveler: *We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.*
Jifang: A music festival, you say? You know, I actually met my husband because of a song. Quite the coincidence, eh?
Paimon: Ooh! Which song was it? Bet we can play it for you â€” we're super serious about music!
Jifang: Oh, in that case, could you play it if I were to hum the tune?
Traveler: Sure, I'll give it a go.
Jifang: Haha, how exciting!

### Talk 10 related talk 1

Traveler: How was that?
Jifang: What a wonderfully nostalgic feeling. I was immediately reminded of my studies in Fontaine.
Jifang: I would often go to cafes in Vasari Passage to read, and when I heard this song one day, I asked the barista what it was called.
Jifang: They didn't know, but a large fellow having some cake nearby told me that it was named "Le Souvenir avec le crepuscule." And yeah, later on, he became my husband.
Jifang: He was at the cafe meeting with his friends from a literary club back then. Ah, how nostalgic. We were all so young!
Jifang: Oh, right! Your music festival... I fear I shan't be able to attend, but if needed, I can get my husband to go.
Jifang: He's been fiddling with some old books that haven't been selling well all day, and I haven't been able to dissuade him from doing so.
Jifang: But I'm sure such cultural exchanges would interest him. I'll ask him to bring some souvenirs along that he can give out to boot.

Jifang: So, about those two books...
Jifang: The two of them are long-time customers of ours. I usually prepare their books beforehand.
Jifang: But I ended up dragging my feet a little this time due to the surge in business.
Jifang: They must have gotten impatient...

### Talk 10 related talk 5

Traveler: So, about those two books...
Jifang: Have you delivered them?
Traveler: Yes, I have.
Jifang: Thank you. Wanwen Bookhouse has managed to stay open all this time due to the support of our long-time customers.
Jifang: What's more, these customers are true lovers of books. It should gladden them greatly to receive good ones.
Jifang: Thanks so much for your help, Traveler. Please take this as compensation for your efforts.
Jifang: If you should ever wish to purchase any books, feel free to approach me.

### Talk 10 related talk 6

Traveler: I want to know about the Wanwen Bookhouse.
Jifang: Strange, most people who come here are looking for books, not the bookhouse itself...
Jifang: Anyway, my husband is the one with a bit of a thing for collecting old books. But he doesn't earn any money...
Jifang: That's why I opened this place. Got to make a living somehow.

### Talk 10 related talk 7

Traveler: Any recommended reads?
Jifang: Let's see... If you like poetry, Humor From Tianheng is selling well at the moment. Seems to have a mass appeal.
Jifang: If you're a visitor in town, you might enjoy Records of Jueyun. It's not for the faint-hearted, though.

### Talk 10 related talk 8

Traveler: Goodbye.
Jifang: Typical. You sit there reading the book in-store, then as soon as I ask if you want to buy it you're all, "Oh, I'm just browsing" and "Oh, I might come back tomorrow..."

## Talk 15

Jifang: I'm just taking a look around the market. Don't forget to stop by the Wanwen Bookhouse if you have time.
Jifang: Although, the store is full of old books that won't sell... I'm half inclined to turn them into scrap paper and donate them as Mingxiao Lantern supplies.
