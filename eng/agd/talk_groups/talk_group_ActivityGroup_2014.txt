# Talk Group: ActivityGroup - 2014

## Talk

Kaedehara Kazuha: It was a great pleasure to enjoy a delicious meal to the gentle whisper of the sea breeze. Thank you for making dinner for everyone, Xinyan.
Xinyan: No problem. I'm just glad y'all enjoyed it. I was real worried that I hadn't made enough for everyone... or that I'd made too much.
Xinyan: By the way, how was your walk today? Find any high-up spots with a good view?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes. The bard's description of an "emerald isle" describes this place perfectly.
Xinyan: Oh? So what about the rest of the story, is that true as well?
Kaedehara Kazuha: It's hard to say. But I do believe it.
Xinyan: Well then, let's hope we wake up tomorrow morning to the sight of the Dodo-King or a Dodoco! That'd be fun.
Xinyan: ...Of course, I don't mind if that doesn't happen. It's amazing just to be here on the island from the story, and to get to make some friends from Mondstadt.

## Talk

Fischl: The mortal temptations stopped the truth in its tracks, denying the verdict of my victory the chance to be announced in my presence.
Mona: Wow, I'm surprised you have the nerve to bring that up again.
Mona: #You and Oz are like two peas in a pod, trying desperately to convince Traveler and Paimon that you were the victor. I hardly see how that's fair.
Mona: Besides, only the loser would want to get—
Fischl: Say that again?
Oz: Mein Fräulein, she means to say that you are the loser.
Fischl: Silence, Oz!
Fischl: Ahem... Lady Megistus, let us put aside the sacred matter of our trial for now. Once I have reclaimed my throne in the Immernachtreich, we shall settle this for good in the Garten Sanssouci!
Mona: Oh, that's fine by me, I'll beat you no matter how many times you ask for a rematch... wait, but what is that place, exactly?

## Talk

Venti: Achoo!
Venti: Ugh... Guess I shouldn't get too close to the cats after all... I'll just stay on the roof.

## Talk

Kaedehara Kazuha: The life of a wanderer is full of hardships. I have asked myself these questions many times:
Kaedehara Kazuha: Should I go? If so, where to, and by what means?

## Talk

Kaedehara Kazuha: But I have no choice. The boundless world is calling out to me.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Farewell, my dear grandfather and father.

## Talk

Kaedehara Kazuha: A final farewell, for I do not believe I will ever return to Inazuma.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But if one day, I do return...
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...No. That day will never come.

## Talk

Mona: Okay, this ought to do the trick.
Kaedehara Kazuha: There is a sound coming from the island.

## Talk

Xinyan: Kazuha, can you feel the wind? Which direction is it blowing in?
Kaedehara Kazuha: It's coming from that direction. I'll take you to a hill where the wind blows.

## Talk

Paimon: Whoa! Where did they come from!?

## Talk

Blazing Heart: The spirit of resistance!
Blazing Heart: It feels good to shout out your motto at the top of your voice.

## Talk

Frozen Soul: Shh... calm your mind and listen carefully.
Frozen Soul: Can you hear it? The ocean, the sky, and the mountains... everything in the world has its own unique song.

## Talk

Narrator: "...spoke amid a downpour of the dragon's blood. She said, 'May my people be freed from the shackles of ancient decrees.'"
Oz: Such wise and compassionate words could only come from your own writing, mein Fräulein.
Fischl: Hmph, yet this kingdom appears to be anything but what I've described. The shadows lurking behind the scenes are disconcerting...
Narrator: "Prinzessin Fischl again continued her song, and the interwoven chords of her sacred words became the Immernachtreich's hymn."

## Talk

Narrator: "She picked up mere stones to carve out mountains and oceans, before bestowing upon her people castles and towns."
Narrator: "My magnificent kingdom is a small and forbidden paradise."

## Talk

Leon: Aah! Help me!

## Talk

Paimon: There's the book! Let's go and close it.
Paimon: Let's hope we won't get transported to another strange place this time...

## Talk

Paimon: We've found all the crystalline cores. Let's put them back into the machine!

## Talk

Mona: Is this the end of our vacation...
Traveler: Do you want to chat?
Mona: Sure, is there something you wanted to ask me?
Traveler: About your scryglass...
Mona: *sigh* It's really quite frustrating. Lately, my scryglass has been acting up whenever something major occurs.
Mona: ...It's as if it's deliberately trying to stop me from seeing how things will end.
Mona: Hold on... I hope you didn't bring that up just to poke fun at me?
Traveler: About the starry sky...
Mona: Oh, I actually wanted to ask you as well. How did you feel when you saw that stretch of sky?
Traveler: It was magnificent!
Mona: Oh... oh really?
Mona: Well, I—I am a genius astrologist, after all. Of course my mirage was going to be magnificent...
Traveler: That's the Mona I know!
Mona: Hmm... But I was so immersed in my thoughts at the time, I didn't realize how magnificent until I heard you speak...
Traveler: It was so spellbinding!
Mona: Yes, I know... It was on purpose, wasn't it?
Traveler: About this vacation...
Mona: Although I'm only here because Fischl dragged me along, somewhere on the way, this turned into a wonderful summer.
Mona: To bear witness and to defend everyone's destiny... that's exactly what I try to do.
Traveler: You've done a great job.
Mona: Thank you. You too, of course... you've done a lot here.
Mona: I look forward to working with you again, hehe... I'm sure we will be even better partners.
Traveler: I won't disturb you.
Mona: Mmm, make sure to enjoy yourself before leaving this island.

## Talk

Xinyan: I've got some new inspiration for a song...
Traveler: Do you want to chat?
Xinyan: Sure, I'd love to.
Traveler: About friends...
Xinyan: I am going to share this adventure with my friends when I get back. Who knows, it may even give Yun Jin some new ideas for her opera.
Xinyan: As for Xiangling, I'm sure she'll come up with a bunch of suggestions the minute that anything cooking-related comes up.
Xinyan: You know her, a true professional, she knows everything... Like how to make a good stew without a pot. That's something I'd like to learn from her...
Xinyan: I need to learn some new dishes before my new friends come to visit. Oh, and Roasted Lavender Melons is definitely gonna be one of them!
Traveler: About music...
Xinyan: Are you a little disappointed that I didn't play any rock music back in my mirage?
Traveler: Not at all.
Xinyan: Whew, glad to hear it.
Xinyan: Rock 'n' roll is my first love, that'll never change.
Xinyan: But music is also a vehicle for all kinds of emotions. Rather than only expressing my own feelings, I figured what I did was more suitable for the occasion.
Xinyan: Hehe, perhaps now, I can call you a kindred spirit in our understanding of music.
Traveler: About this vacation...
Xinyan: It's been action-packed and awesome fun!
Xinyan: I really have to thank you and that bard fella for the invitation.
Xinyan: I wonder how his live performances have been going... I owe him big time. I'll have to find a way to thank that guy in the future.
Traveler: Let's buy him a drink.
Xinyan: Sure! It's a deal!
Traveler: I won't disturb you.
Xinyan: Okay, make sure to take it easy.

## Talk

Kaedehara Kazuha: The sound of nature is so relaxing. There's nothing more to worry about...
Traveler: Do you want to chat?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Sure. What's on your mind?
Traveler: About drinking...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Ahem...
Kaedehara Kazuha: That was days ago. I'm surprised you still remember...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Fine drinks belong in the same space as poetry and elegance. To lose myself like that in the tavern... it was truly humiliating.
Traveler: About your past...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Right, about that. After these events, I suppose I've bid a formal farewell to my past.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Don't worry, I feel just as fine as I did during the times before. I am burdened by neither grief nor regret.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I appreciate these twists of fate from the bottom of my heart.
Traveler: You're always so chill...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Thank you. Can I take it as a compliment?
Traveler: Certainly.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I'm so happy to have a friend like you.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Let's shift our focus back to the scenery in front of us and take a good look at the clouds and waves before we leave.
Traveler: About this vacation...
Kaedehara Kazuha: It's had its ups and downs, but ultimately, it's been quite rewarding.
Kaedehara Kazuha: If Beidou and the crew ask me about our experiences, I suppose I'll tell them about the squirrel and the ship spirit... as for stories about my new friends, I'll keep them to myself.
Traveler: That's good.
Kaedehara Kazuha: #The end of every journey marks the beginning of a new adventure. I'm sure this is a feeling you are most familiar with, Traveler.
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...Keep moving forwards. That's the important thing.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Just like you, I have a lot of hope for the future.
Traveler: I won't disturb you.
Kaedehara Kazuha: You must be tired from the past few days. Take a well-deserved rest.
