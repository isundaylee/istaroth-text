# One Giant Step for Alchemy?


## Talk 1

Traveler: What is it?
Timaeus: ...Traveler! Hi! Hold up a second...
Timaeus: Okay, so... I'm sorry about this, but... there's something I really need your help with.
Timaeus: As you know, I've never made much progress in my alchemical studies...
Timaeus: Well, I've realized that I can't keep trying the same things over and over again. Clearly, that approach is getting me nowhere.
Traveler: You're switching to bio-alchemy?
Traveler: You're going back to the origins of the art?
Timaeus: So, I decided I'd change focus. Take a fresh approach. Attempt something that's not been done before...
Timaeus: There's nothing particularly new about bio-alchemy. There are already people researching that.
Timaeus: You mean study the alchemical arts of the ancients? No, that's not something I'd be able to get involved in...
Timaeus: Do you know what the most important factor in alchemy is? It's the elements.
Timaeus: For a number of reasons, alchemy is mostly performed using items infused with elemental energy, rather than pure elemental energy itself.
Timaeus: Naturally, this introduces impurities into the transmutation process, making the elemental reactions less effective...
Timaeus: To compensate, we must use larger quantities of elemental materials. Even then, we still need to be very hands-on during the transmutation process, as the impurities can easily ruin the outcome.
Timaeus: Unfortunately, this all creates extra costs for those who wish to perform alchemy without using Visions.
Timaeus: The biggest issue is that items infused with elemental energy do not come cheap.
Timaeus: The bill for the average transmutation is more astonishing than the fruits of our labor...
Traveler: I don't have a Vision, either.
Traveler: So, what do you need me to do?
Timaeus: *sigh* Maybe this is why I've never made any tangible progress. The barrier to entry is just too high...
Timaeus: True... But I hear you can still manipulate elemental energy, correct?
Timaeus: I've heard you can manipulate elemental energy even though you don't have a Vision. Is that right?
Timaeus: Here's the thing: I've come up with a new kind of alchemical furnace which I call the <color=#00E1FFFF>Elemental Crucible</color>. The idea behind it is...
Timaeus: Well, basically, it's a vessel that can hold pure elemental energy and generate elemental reactions.
Timaeus: With any luck, the Elemental Crucible will be the thing that takes my alchemical skills to the next level...
Timaeus: Everything is set up and ready to go. All I'm missing now is someone with the ability to actually move the pure elemental energy around.
Timaeus: If you're willing to help out, please meet me at the <color=#00E1FFFF>Thousand Winds Temple</color>. That's where I had some people set everything up.
Timaeus: I really hope this will be my big breakthrough in alchemy...

## Talk 2

Timaeus: There you are. So, here it is â€” the <color=#00E1FFFF>Elemental Crucible</color>.
Timaeus: Let's fire it up and see if it works.

## Talk 3

Timaeus: Just need to activate it a few more times...
Timaeus: Traveler! Just who I wanted to see. Do you remember that Elemental Crucible I made?
Timaeus: After you activated it, I was able to gather a fair bit of data from the sidelines.
Timaeus: Most importantly, I was able to determine its reliability.
Timaeus: With such reliable apparatus, we will be able to perform even more experiments from now on.
Timaeus: If you're willing to help, Traveler, could you help me activate the Elemental Crucible once more?
Traveler: Gotcha.
Timaeus: Many thanks.
Traveler: How many experiments would you like to conduct?
Timaeus: The more the merrier, of course. For a Vision-less alchemist like myself, these brute-force measures are the only way I can do research...
Timaeus: So please help me activate the Elemental Crucible again. I'll be in your debt, Traveler.
