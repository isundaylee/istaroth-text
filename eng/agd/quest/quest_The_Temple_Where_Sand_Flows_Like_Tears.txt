# The Temple Where Sand Flows Like Tears


## Talk 1

Investigate (Afiyah Chief's Hand-Written Orders): "Make camp upon reaching your destination and seal the canyon to outsiders. Only members of the Tanit and the following tribes may pass..."
Investigate (Afiyah Chief's Hand-Written Orders): "...If you discover any who carry a Jinni bottle with them, take it. The bounty will be split as agreed..."
Paimon: Huh, so they intentionally didn't go for Jeht, then?
Liloupar: ...How interesting.
Liloupar: Now, my master, we need not be hasty. Let us clear the next camp first.

## Talk 2

Jeht: Alright! That's one device done and dusted.
Azariq: Hmm? The door we came through has been sealed. We're going to have to find another way through.

## Talk 3

Aderfi: Ah, it's you.
Aderfi: Matriarch Babel mentioned you previously, honored guest. Please, have a look around.
Traveler: Are you a merchant?
Aderfi: Hmm? You've got a good eye, I must say. Yes, I am indeed a merchant. I sell the various things that the tribe lacks. Cosmetics, luxury items, costumes, toys, agricultural products, intricate tools...
Aderfi: What would you like? If you should need something, I'll have it. And if I don't, just tell me what you need, and I'll get it for you, whether it's from the city, or even from Fontaine!
Aderfi: Ah... Right, you're an outsider. Well, in that case, you have my apologies, but my shop is not open to you.
Aderfi: Of course, you are our guest, so you can feel free to take whatever catches your eye here in my tent... Uh, as long as you don't take it all, anyway.
Traveler: You've got lots of books here. May I read them?
Aderfi: The books? Oh! Right, those are here at the request of Matriarch Babel. I'm sure you've heard, and seen, that the city people have taken to using this thing called the Akasha, which they mount on their ears.
Aderfi: Their libraries have been emptied of a great number of obsolete books, and the Matriarch had me purchase and safe-keep them for everyone to read free of charge. Hmph... I operated at a loss there.
Aderfi: As for the Akasha, we did ship a set in from another tribe, but it was... very inconvenient to use, not to mention quite arcane indeed. We could not disassemble or repair it, for the wiring was too centralized...
Aderfi: Whatever the case, I'd say that reading books on your own is far better than relying on some strange machine to stuff information into your brain.
Aderfi: After all, who knows what back doors you might open if you just let people into the door of your mind?
Traveler: See you.
Aderfi: Don't let me get in your way.
Traveler: What are you selling here, anyway?
Aderfi: Straight to the point, hmm? I like buyers like you. Unfortunately, I don't sell to outsiders.
Aderfi: Um, this is not due to xenophobia or some kind of base prejudice. It's more that... Our tribe and the merchants in the cities don't share economic spheres, if you can glean my meaning?
Aderfi: I only serve the Tanit tribe, you know, as our exclusive distributer of goods. All trade and other transactions have to go through Matriarch Babel, and I take a small cut of that.
Aderfi: Of course, you are our guest, so you can feel free to take whatever catches your eye here in my tent... Uh, as long as you don't take it all, anyway.
Traveler: About Benben...
Aderfi: Benben... Ah, you mean the little machine that follows Jeht around.
Aderfi: I've examined it before. There's nothing particularly wrong with it, but as for how it can be restored to its former, energetic state...
Aderfi: I have my ways... but I don't think I could tell you.
Aderfi: Whatever the case, I think it's best that it stays with me till the repairs are done.
Aderfi: Anything else you'd like to ask me?

## Talk 4

Paimon: Hey, why did you stop us? The thing we're looking for is just up ahead...
Jeht: Shh!
Traveler: What is it?
Jeht: Look behind you — we're not alone.
Traveler: Why did we stop?

## Talk 5

Azariq: It's said that the destruction of the city was not a deed done from without, but that it fell to revolt from within. That certainly lines up with what we've seen...
Azariq: Most of the damage was done to the interior. Perhaps it was a slave revolt? Or a civil war between priests?
Jeht: It could also be the work of long years of disrepair or Wenut activity, right?
Azariq: Wenut...? I doubt that much at least. Wenut don't dare to touch these ruins, and if the elders are to be believed, that's because this city is "ill-fated."
Jeht: Alright, enough ghost stories for now. Let's keep going.

## Talk 6

Yuften: Hello... Guest of Tanit...
Yuften: J—J—Jeht mentions you often. She's a good kid.
Traveler: What are you up to?
Yuften: Planting crops and f—feeding the fish. Sometimes, I also do some b—b—butchery. Crocodile skin and meat is v—very useful.
Yuften: We get clean spring water all year around h—here, so it's just right for raising crocodiles. Th—that's why we fenced this place up.
Yuften: Crocodiles are easy to care for, and they can be harvested for lots of skins and meat. Unfortunately, f—fields are a d—different story...
Traveler: You have fields around here?
Yuften: We do... but only for testing. Matriarch Babel invited some outsiders to c—c—come and provide us with Anahitian Blessing, and she got all these old books from the city...
Yuften: S—s—so we've tried our hand at farming according to the contents of these books.
Yuften: But the oases in the canyon are too narrow and lack nutrients. We need to find a way to f—fertilize the soil.
Traveler: Tell me about the Anahitian Blessing...
Yuften: The outsiders didn't want to reveal the fertilizer's composition. As such, we've had to rely on the people who provide it to f—fertilize the soil... which isn't good.
Yuften: Th—that's why the Matriarch wants me to d—do some research here to r—reverse engineer our own Anahitian Blessing.
Traveler: I shan't disturb you any longer.
Yuften: Th—that's alright. Please take some crocodile jerky, dear guest. It's just over there...
Traveler: Crocodiles, you say!?
Yuften: Hehe, yes. I—I take care of them. These are quite large and obedient...
Yuften: This one's c—c—called Sedim. Very fierce and strong, and skin's very vibrant. It'll make for a good satchel. And there's that one, Karam. It's small but plump. Rather gentle, too.

## Talk 7

Jeht: Phew, we're back at the temple!
Azariq: Well, next up, let's get the issue of the large device at the center squared away, shall we?
Paimon: Ugh... How are you all not dizzy from all this looping around?

## Talk 8

Jeht: Is the conversation with Matriarch Babel over?
Jeht: In that case... Let's take a short break.

## Talk 9

Jeht: Look, there's sand flowing down from the cracks. It seems that some place deeper within the ruins is shaking!
Azariq: Yes, I sense it too.

## Talk 10

Masseira: Spoken to Babel, have you? Ah, she's probably busying herself somewhere else again... You would sooner stop the wind than stop her.
Masseira: Haha... You know, youngster, speaking of the wind... I'd like to remind you of a kind of desert wind that we call "Zibri."
Masseira: At first, you won't sense anything, until the sandstorm rises over the horizon, and the air itself begins to ascend and burn. Only then will you realize...
Masseira: ...That you can no longer smell anything, for the heated air has smothered your sense of smell, seared your nostrils...
Masseira: By then... Heh. By then, it will be too late.
Traveler: I'm afraid I didn't catch your drift...
Masseira: It's nothing... I just mean to say that you should be careful of the sandstorms.

## Talk 11

Jeht: These empty hallways all eventually lead back to the same center. How did the people who worshiped the gods here live...?
Azariq: Alright, little wildcat. Rather than caring about how now-dead people lived, you should have a care for how you might yet die.
Jeht: Oh, I have a care for how you might, sure!
Azariq: Oh? But let me guess — you can't bear to tell me?
Jeht: Hmph!
Paimon: You two really do get along nicely...

## Talk 12

Azariq: Is there some problem?
Azariq: Hmph... I did see this large device in some really old theses, but this is the first time I've ever seen a real one up close.

## Talk 13

Investigate (Neat Note): "...The outland traveler may be identified by: their golden hair and eyes, strange foreign clothing, and a small floating fairy by their side..."
Investigate (Neat Note): "...If they have obtained a Jinni, take it from them, and if they have yet to, then dispose of them..."
Investigate (Neat Note): "Contact: Aderfi..."
Paimon: ...!
Traveler: So it was Aderfi...
Liloupar: Someone you know, then?
Liloupar: My master, if I may, I would advise that you review your choice of friends. We had an old saying for this ilk...
Liloupar: "The only loyal desert-dweller is one whose shoulders have been pierced by iron loops."
Liloupar: We should be rid of all of them now. Let us return.

## Talk 14

Investigate (Goods Invoice): "May this be testimony that we have provided the material support required for this ambush and robbery. As a token of friendship, the gifts shall be sent via specially-arranged Sumpter Beast caravan..."
Investigate (Goods Invoice): "The Tanit tribe sends respectful greetings to the Afiyah tribe. May peace follow you, and may spices fill your storehouses."
Paimon: Wait just a second! The Tanit tribe...
Traveler: That's Jeht's tribe...
Paimon: And that means... Ugh, were these guys hired by them?
Liloupar: Oho, so the desert people have learned to use books to keep records? Well, I suppose my awakening has given rise to fresh sights after all.
Paimon: But what were they intending to do here, anyway?
Liloupar: Who knows? Most importantly, they were our foes.
Liloupar: Well, since we have found one part of a paper trail, we may as well search their encampment. There, I believe, we shall find more clues.
Paimon: How do you know that's definitely the case?
Liloupar: Toads do not lay one egg at a time, and centipedes and scorpions huddle together in the damp shade.
Paimon: Ugh, you and your creepy analogies again...
Liloupar: Whatever the case may be, we no longer need any of them in one piece. Let us proceed to the next encampment.

## Talk 15

Jeht: The blood of outsiders does not mix with that of the tribe, so in many things, I tend to represent something of an "exception"...
Jeht: And since I've already been to lots of places that are "bad luck," they were fine with sending me to explore this place.
Paimon: Wait... Aren't they just ostracizing you!?
Jeht: Well, no... The tribe's just like that. They treat me very well, but I have an outsider's blood. That's all there is to it.

## Talk 16

Jeht: It's just like the book says... "Under the influence of the Jinn, though the land was as a barren desert, it would grow into a verdant oasis..."
Paimon: Hey, look at that. Isn't there something shiny under that big tree? Could that be the Jinni we're looking for?
Jeht: Careful, Paimon! We're not sure if this place is safe yet!

## Talk 17

Azariq: A lot of the ruined areas we've encountered on the way show signs of man-made damage... There might have been unrest here, or even a war.
Azariq: I'm no researcher, so I can't really read any pattern in these markings, but I doubt that the fate of this temple was a peaceful one.
Jeht: The books say that Gurabad was destroyed with searing fire and the great anger of the Jinn...
Azariq: The Jinn? Perhaps... But it looks more like the work of a mob, soldiers, or perhaps even tribespeople like us... But who knows, eh?
Jeht: But we can think about that later. I think this big guy here is our more pressing concern, no?
Azariq: Indeed... Perhaps the other chambers are all structured like this one. Let's look around again, shall we?
Jeht: Alright, I'll mark our path.
Paimon: Huh? Mark? Paimon didn't see you do that.
Jeht: We use scented oils made from Wenut larvae, planting it to mark the path we must tread, so that if we do get lost, we can just follow our nose to find the way back.
Azariq: Now I'll have you know that our wildcat's nose is very sharp. We hunters wouldn't get very far without her!
Jeht: Stop saying all that stuff, Azariq!
Traveler: That's right, you blockhead, stop bullying our little wildcat.
Jeht: And you! Don't you start with that nonsense too!
Traveler: Look, her fur's standing on end.
Jeht: It's not!
Traveler: What's a Wenut larva?
Jeht: Well, it's the... larva of a Wenut. *sigh* Agh, I've seen them so often that I'm actually not sure how to explain what they are. Tell you what, I'll explain more on the way back...

## Talk 18

Jeht: Listen. This device has been activated too!
Paimon: And that's a wrap. Let's go back!

## Talk 19

???: Ah, Jeht! And our guests! So you are here, after all.
Jeht: "After all"? You trying to get familiar with us? We're pretty busy over here, so you'd better have had a good reason to stop us.
Messenger: Ah, um... No, well, this... I was sent by Matriarch Babel with a message for you, Jeht. She has something urgent to discuss and would like you to, um... well, return to the campsite first...
Jeht: This... That... What's got your tongue? Do you need me to shorten it for you? Did she say anything else?
Messenger: She'd like to speak with you alone... Sorry. I didn't know you were in a bad mood...
Jeht: A bad mood? Nonsense, I've never been better! You know, what with having found the Mother of the Jinn and all — which I'll be telling the Matriarch, of course.
Jeht: #I'm more than pleased, and so will she be, I bet! And so will her "master," to have a nice new servant — wouldn't you say, Traveler?
Traveler: ...
Jeht: ...
Jeht: #Matriarch Babel has business with me, so I'll take my leave now. My deepest apologies for not serving you to the end, Prince Traveler.
Jeht: Alright, let's go see the Matriarch.
Messenger: S... Sure. As for you, honored guests, just follow this canyon, and you'll reach our camp soon enough.
Liloupar: ...
Traveler: What is it?
Liloupar: Not much. I just thought that this child is quite interesting, that's all.
Paimon: Really, though, she's got quite the temper...
Paimon: She isn't... y'know, jealous of a bottle, is she?
Liloupar: You mean to say that she takes "a bottle" for her yardstick? Hah, perhaps.
Liloupar: Regardless, she is a good child. Trustworthy... if a little foolish.
Traveler: Stop talking about her like that. She's our friend.
Liloupar: Ah, see, I like you more already, my master.
Paimon: Coming from you, that's kinda scary...
Traveler: Jeht's just impulsive.
Liloupar: Oh, do not mistake my meaning, my master. I very much love the earnest impulsiveness of young women...
Liloupar: But she will be taught, my dear master... Trust me, she will.
Paimon: Even if that happens, we'll pull her right outta the fire! That's what friends are for, after all!

## Talk 20

Azariq: #We're here! C'mon, let's find a place to sit and grab a bite, Traveler.
Jeht: ...
Paimon: Hey there, Azariq, Jeht!
Traveler: It's been a while.
Azariq: Haha, hardly that long! Good to see that you're all well. Jeht's really fond of you — we were just talking about you, in fact.
Paimon: Eh? What did you talk about?
Traveler: Is Jeht still angry?
Azariq: Huh? Angry...?
Jeht: ...
Azariq: Oh! She did mention a little disagreement you had, yes... But you know, she talks quite carelessly, but isn't actually good at expressing her feelings.
Azariq: Still, you should reflect as well. Jeht's very concerned about your safety, so you should pay a bit more attention to her suggestions.
Traveler: Sorry, it was my mistake for leaving her out.
Jeht: Sorry, it was my fault, really. I was... petty. Childish.
Jeht: I knew how important Liloupar was to our mission, but I threw a tantrum anyway...
Paimon: Liloupar says stuff weirdly, and she does use some pretty creepy analogies...
Paimon: But she looked out for us the whole way, so... Well, she's different from the people we've met so far for sure, but she doesn't seem like a bad person!
Paimon: #Whatever the case... It'll be fine. Traveler's important to you, isn't {F#she}{M#he}, Jeht?
Jeht: #Of course. You're my best friends.
Liloupar: ...
Paimon: Yeesh, you're so serious all of a sudden. Paimon doesn't know what to say at all...
Jeht: Ugh, there's no need to be so awkward! I won't get mad anyhow from now on, and you can count on that!
Azariq: Hahahaha! That's right, that's the spirit!
Azariq: Ah, right! About the "Mother of the Jinn"... Is it with you?
Traveler: Yes.
Jeht: Azariq! Didn't Matriarch Babel tell you not to ask that willy-nilly?
Azariq: It's fine, Jeht! I mean, I guided you half the way, so I count as a "companion," don't I?
Liloupar: A "companion," you say? Perhaps you speak too hastily.
Azariq: Eh? The bottle's talking!
Liloupar: Such insolence! If you recognize me not, then your silence shall serve better!
Azariq: Whoa, this is a pretty fierce one for sure... Is that the Mother of the Jinn, then?
Liloupar: I'd watch my tongue if I were you, desert-spawn.
Jeht: This is Azariq, one of my brothers here in the tribe.
Liloupar: Hmph... Well, we could have chosen worse. This one is sturdy enough. A shame that he has too big a mouth, and too small a brain.
Jeht: *sigh* How is talking to her supposed to *not* end as an exercise in frustration?
Traveler: Reckon you just need to get used to it...
Paimon: Hmm, y'know, Jeht, you did find Benben pretty cute, didn't you? How about you just treat her like a Benben that talks! They both fly, don't they? Hehe.
Azariq: Oh, it's fine! Sharp tongues are to be expected of the legendary Jinni... somewhat, I mean.
Azariq: Whatever the case, she's on our side, isn't she? We'll be fine!
Liloupar: On "your side"? Did I mishear you?
Liloupar: Apologies, but you shall not find me on the "side" of those who entreat my master while wearing two faces.
Azariq: ...
Jeht: ...
Liloupar: #My master trusts you, and I trust {F#her}{M#his} reasoning for that. But I will be watching you, Azariq.
Jeht: Heh... Well, I guess that's just what a Jinni's like...
Azariq: ...It's fine.
Azariq: Ah, right. Did anything happen while we were separated? Just curious, I mean.
Jeht: Same here. Did I miss anything?
Traveler: Well, about that...
Black Screen Text: You tell Jeht and Azariq about the ambush in the canyon, as well as Aderfi's departure from the camp...
Jeht: ...
Jeht: So, a traitor, along with accomplices from other tribes... They might be the same bunch I was tracking down previously. It's even possible that they're collaborating with dangerous outsiders like the Fatui.
Paimon: Huh...?
Azariq: Hah, pretty good, Jeht. Made the best of some rather limited information on our foes there.
Jeht: That's not too hard. I've been helping the Matriarch to track and... eliminate traitors, so their movements and patterns aren't that alien to me.
Jeht: My dad and I have also encountered those people who call themselves "Fatui" in the past, so they're no strangers to me either.
Jeht: Still... I ran off in a huff without giving any thought to whether they would act... I'm sorry. That was my mistake.
Paimon: Oh, let's leave that aside for now. It wasn't even your fault...
Azariq: I'm with Paimon. Don't beat yourself up about this too much, Jeht. They seem to have been ordered specifically not to attack you — can't blame you for having lowered your guard there.
Jeht: But as for Aderfi... Since he's fled in secret, it's beyond doubt that he's betrayed us. Those who violate the laws of hospitality and wield their blades against guests are unworthy of the Tanit's mercy.
Jeht: #I'll capture him, Traveler, this I promise. He will not escape the Matriarch's judgment.
Azariq: ...
Paimon: Hoho, Jeht's getting serious!
Jeht: What? You make it sound like I've never been serious!
Azariq: Haha! Becoming ever more the model of a tribeswoman, eh, Jeht?
Jeht: What are you talking about? Aren't I one?
Azariq: That's not what I mean. I'm just glad to see that you're so concerned about your friends.
Jeht: This is also a tribal matter, you know...
Azariq: True... Outsiders are becoming increasingly active in the desert, and as their interference increases, so too do changes of heart and thought.
Azariq: As Matriarch Babel's right and left hands, we should indeed be concerned about such things.
Jeht: Exactly.
Azariq: Ah, right. There's one more thing. It's Wenut season at the moment, so the tunnels they dig are starting to show up all around the desert.
Azariq: Such areas are very dangerous, so we'll have to approach our adventure with more care and avoid them at all costs.
Jeht: Wait. Just Wenut? Don't we always hunt them? They're no threat.
Azariq: That's still no reason to drop your guard.
Jeht: Sure, sure, I get it.
Traveler: What's a Wenut?
Jeht: Oh, them? We hunt them every year, and then we collect their body fat and use that to make spices. We don't produce much, but it can be sold at a pretty price.
Azariq: So we don't really lack anything. We just need to control the Wenut hunting grounds, and our long-term prospects will stay good.
Jeht: City folk love these thick and pungent spices... But ask them about us desert folk, and they'll tell you a different story... We also need to hunt other animals, but the smell Wenut give off is too strong and will chase them off.
Azariq: As such, our spice workers can't take part in hunts, nor can they serve as assassins.
Jeht: As opposed to the scent of mature Wenut, their larvae give off a much gentler scent, which we often use for scent marks to prevent getting lost in caves or ruins...
Azariq: Haha, you used that in the Gurabad ruins back there.
Paimon: But... are they really that dangerous?
Jeht: Not really...
Azariq: For you outsiders, perhaps?
Jeht: But you needn't worry about that! We'll protect you!
Liloupar: Pfft...
Paimon: Eh? What's so funny?
Liloupar: It's nothing... Ah, the children of Apep, reduced to this...
Paimon: Now that you mention it, you haven't said anything in quite a while, Liloupar.
Liloupar: And I for my part was about to ask if you'd forgotten about someone. Well then. Would you like to hear a story?
Paimon: Hehe, sure! As long as you have one to tell, anyway!
Liloupar: *sigh* 'Tis a shame how long I've slumbered. I fear I am not current with the hot topics of the day, and am armed only with some ancient yarns. Will you mind, O master mine?
Traveler: Don't worry, I'm all ears.
Jeht: Don't worry, I've covered my ears!
Paimon: And Paimon's covered h— Waaaait a minute. What are you covering your ears for?
Jeht: The books say that the words of the Jinn have magic in them, and that their stories have the power to lay curses!
Liloupar: And they say also that behavior such as yours is impolite in the extreme! Do not interrupt me, little lady.
Liloupar: Hmm... Now, where should I begin...?
Black Screen Text: As the moonlight paints the stones white, and night wind blows chill, causing the tendrils of the campfire to snap and crackle... Amidst the calls of nocturnal birds winding across the distant sand dunes, the Jinni begins her tale...
Black Screen Text: Thousands of years have passed since the events told of in this tale. The desert had yet to become so desolate, and the oases spread out across the land like glittering jewels...
In those days, the Jinn walked the earth in great numbers, and they lived within the silver night wind and the flowing sands, in the ripples of the unknowable ocean, and in the pattering of the rainforest springs...
Black Screen Text: We Jinn were not ordinary creatures, but we were the servants of the mistress of flowers.
We were untroubled by basic want, nor were we shackled by material thirst. It was "life" itself that greatly fascinated us...
The blooming and wilting of flowers, the gathering and scattering of birds — these were the things that held us in thrall.
Apart from that, only our "true names" could bind us.
Black Screen Text: We were carefree so long as our mistress walked the earth, and we enjoyed her eternal paradise, her love, and her comfort...
But tragedy would come, and our paradise crumbled as the mistress departed... Our revelry turned to mourning, and all that was good and lovely was violently perverted in that anguish...
Black Screen Text: And so we gave Al-Ahmar our true names, and became his servants... For he promised to find us our eternal companion, our true master.
Deluded hope and trust did we harbor in our hearts, and so forsook our freedom, accepting imprisonment within silver bottles and servitude to his realm...
But what was lost was forever lost, never again to return.
Black Screen Text: But do not think that the Jinn were wanton servants.
Only a love bordering upon madness could make the Jinn give their "true names" willingly.
For it was their deep love for the mistress of flowers that drove them to embrace the desert from the first.
Yet, waking to face the tomfoolery of this barren world caused a surly Jinni to fall incurably in love with the shepherd...
Liloupar: Ah, you're awake...
Traveler: A shepherd...?
Liloupar: Not you, no... Hah, but much like you, my master. You were... much like him — as he was once.
Jeht: ...
Liloupar: Well now, girl, does that make you jealous?
Jeht: #No. It's just that I find this story quite familiar...
Liloupar: #That's because this story has happened before, and may yet happen again.
Jeht: #Hmm...
Liloupar: *sigh* To the Jinn, "love" was a terrible chain, driving those who fell into its pit to make sacrifices, like the hyphae of a parasitic insect...
Paimon: Oh boy, Liloupar's at it again with the scary analogies...
Liloupar: Hehe, we Jinn do not have this tedious thing you humans call "shame," so we do not shy away from discussing love, or revealing one's all to a lover.
Jeht: #*cough*!
Liloupar: But to the Jinn, this mad love could not be reconciled to betrayal. Or else, hatred and vengeance three times greater would be sure to follow.
Liloupar: That was the root of the farce that ended Gurabad... Though that is a different tale.
Jeht: Actually, now that you mention it, I'd like to ask a question... Did you really have no other goal in presenting your "true name"?
Liloupar: Hmm? Hah, well, I suppose vigilance is wisdom.
Liloupar: Well, I do have something I seek. I wish to go to the Eternal Oasis, just as you do... There are things there that have been left unfinished.
Traveler: And what may those be?
Liloupar: Forgive me, dear master, if I can only slowly tell you that tale as our journey proceeds. But the time for that has not yet come.
Liloupar: But know this — it is good fortune that I should have met you.
Jeht: Well, since we've got the same goal, let's get along. How about a toast?
Liloupar: And what shall you make this toast with? Me?
Paimon: Pfft... Hahaha!
Azariq: Alright, weird-story-time's over! Let's talk about something more relaxing.
Azariq: #By the way, Traveler, do you play cards?
Traveler: Sorry, I don't.
Liloupar: Eh, alright then... I for one shall not complain if a more elegant pastime were chosen.
Azariq: Oh, that so? Shame, then. Why don't we talk about some of the things we've seen, then?
Black Screen Text: You all speak about the interesting things you've heard about, as well as the hair-raising adventures you've been through. Some absolutely ridiculous hearsay is even mixed in...
The three of you raise toasts to old triumphs, laugh at ridiculous tales, and shed tears and lament the sad stories.
At the end, Azariq closes the proceedings with a joke, and he absolutely kills it.
Black Screen Text: #When the moon hangs highest, Azariq tells a rather coarse joke about a crocodile and a Sumpter Beast, which loses him his blanket-sharing privileges.
Jeht tells you about many trivial but funny things...
She seems to have lived well amongst the Tanit since your last parting.
Black Screen Text: The night flies by as you chat.
As the next morning comes, you are buried in each others' pillows, asleep by the extinguished flame.
Traveler: I feel for you...
Traveler: I'll bear that in mind.

## Talk 21

Paimon: Wow... The plants here have all withered... This doesn't look good.
???: No doubt, no doubt... And who shall we blame for that?
Paimon: #Eh!? Traveler, Look! This bottle can talk!
???: You obstreperous oaf... Where did you get that active yet actively useless tongue of yours, I wonder?
Paimon: Eeek!
Traveler: Are you... the Mother of the Jinn?
???: "Jinn"? Why, yes, I do count as one. "Mother"? Hmm... Well, if it does not displease you, I have been such before.
???: But "Mother of the Jinn"? Do those desert philistines wish to cajole me to laughter? I fear that this joke fails to amuse. It falls far short, in fact.
Jeht: We have come on behalf of the Tanit tribe to see you, to ask that you show forth your great might and aid us in finding the place where Nabu Malikata slumbers...
???: Ah, so it is one of the desert folk. I like you, girl... You know the rules, and your manner of speech tickles me. Yes, you do amuse me.
???: Ah, but... Step aside for a moment. I shall have words with your lord only.
Jeht: ...?
???: Mmm... The scent of unknown spices from afar... A servant girl of the desert-kin, and a flying pet...
???: #You must be a Prince in exile, are you not?
Traveler: I'm not...
Liloupar: Liloupar. Call me Liloupar.
Jeht: Lilou... par... Wait a moment! You're... You're the one from the books...!
Liloupar: Speak not out of turn before your liege, sand-licking lackey!
Jeht: ...!
Traveler: She's my friend!
Paimon: That's right! Jeht isn't a lackey! You're too much!
Liloupar: Ah. Is that so? Oh, the tedium...
Liloupar: Ah... If my soul were not sundered into many parts, unable to muster sufficient strength... I could shift into any number of shapes that might please you.
Liloupar: A dancing girl, a lovely youth, an arhat or a yaksha... Or a lovely beast of those races that died out under the moon's light... I have been them all, and played all their parts, all for my lord's pleasure...
Jeht: Your "lord"...?
Liloupar: A lord I was willing to entrust my true name to... Yes, I did once have such a master. And today, I seem to have encountered his shadow.
Jeht: You mean... Wait, wait a moment!
Traveler: I didn't understand you at all.
Jeht: She means that... Um, well, Jinn make contracts with humans by giving them their "true name." That name can be used to control the Jinn as one wills.
Liloupar: Huh. A learned desert dweller? Your servant girl is quite the rare find.
Jeht: But those who strike such pacts... will eventually suffer the fearful vengeance of the Jinn, for the Jinn are a race that hates humanity.
Liloupar: Hah! "Hate," you say? Such a strong word!
Paimon: Wait, so what Jeht said is wrong?
Liloupar: Look at it this way: would you hate a poisonous insect or toad?
Paimon: Uh...
Jeht: ...And her name is Liloupar, which is the exact same name as the wicked spirit who drowned Ormazd, the mortal king of Gurabad, and his entire household in honey...
Jeht: The history of Gurabad thereafter has been shrouded in dark secrets... Well, that's what I read, anyway.
Jeht: But I don't get it. Is the one Babel looking for really such a dangerous figure?
Liloupar: Ooh, a mighty interesting story that is... Is that how I am portrayed in your legends, then?
Liloupar: Are you worried that in making a contract with me, your lord... friend shall come to harm?
Liloupar: But do you not wish to reach the place where Nabu Malikata slumbers? Hehehe... I shall not aid you, girl, or your... "Matriarch."
Liloupar: I have no interest in your games of governance, nor shall I take part in your schemes... But your friend I shall serve, and give my true name.
Jeht: #But... Why are you willing to give Traveler your true name, then? You must have a reason for that.
Liloupar: #Why, because I like him.
Paimon: #Eh!? Well, Traveler is plenty likable, sure...
Jeht: #You...
Liloupar: #Is it so strange? I like him for his scent, and also for his choice in servants and pets... Yes, such taste truly is fitting of a prince.
Liloupar: Alright, I shan't speak more than I should. Come, Your Highness. Are you ready?
Paimon: Servants and pets... Wait, do you mean Jeht and Paimon!? Gah! You're... so rude!
Paimon: Paimon thinks you're right, Jeht! There's definitely something fishy with this thing. Let's just throw it away and...
Jeht: #Traveler, I get the feeling that we should...
Traveler: For a friend, this is a trivial risk.
Jeht: But... you...
Jeht: No, never mind... If this is your decision...
Liloupar: Ah... You are so very cute.
Liloupar: Well then, Your Highness, place me by your ear, and allow me to tell you my true name...
Paimon: #Traveler...
Traveler: Don't worry about me.
Jeht: ...If you say so.
Traveler: (Do as Liloupar says.)
Black Screen Text: You place the magic bottle next to your ear.
You hear a soft chuckle, and then someone whispers something of unspeakable elegance and gentleness into that ear...
You are told of things as unknowable as the night wind, but you understand every last word nonetheless.
Then, the voice fades, and you feel something cold on your auricle...
Like a viper's kiss.
Liloupar: And with that, we are bound. I shall defend you, my master, from the encroachment of the desert, the searing winds, pestilence, and schemes, and you shall rest safe in the shadow of my wings.
Jeht: ...
Paimon: So, is this bottle gonna start floating around you too?
Liloupar: Unfortunately, yes.
Jeht: Great, we've got the Jinni, so let's go. We've spent too much time here already.
Jeht: #I see a new path in the back, Traveler. Let's head that way!
Traveler: How did that...
Jeht: Don't know, don't care! You coming?
Paimon: Jeht seems angry all of a sudden...
Liloupar: It is to be expected of a girl who has yet to become a mother, I fear.
Paimon: What does that even...?
Traveler: Was it the fight earlier...?
Traveler: This does seem quite fishy...
Liloupar: Hehe, come now, I do believe you are neither conservative nor craven. Even mortal peril holds an abominable attraction for you, does it not?
Traveler: ...
Liloupar: If a reason you must have, an excuse you must claim, then say it is for a friend... Yes. "For a friend." What a lovely ring that has, wouldn't you say?
Traveler: What's wrong, Jeht?
Traveler: I am, but...

## Talk 22

Azariq: Are you all alright?
Jeht: Y—Yeah.
Traveler: Thanks. I'm alright.
Jeht: That's good, that's good.
Paimon: Phew. That gave Paimon quite a fright...
Azariq: ...That tremor's source should be to the north, outside the temple.
Jeht: Yeah, I sensed that too.
Paimon: Wait, why couldn't Paimon tell?
Traveler: Because you fly.
Paimon: Right, that's true... Well, it's not like flying doesn't come with its own troubles, y'know?
Jeht: #Let's go have a look, Traveler. Something huge is bound to have happened!
Traveler: You don't have much experience living in the desert, Paimon...
Paimon: That's true... But wait. You don't either!

## Talk 23

Azariq: #We're here! C'mon, let's find a place to sit and grab a bite, Traveler.
Jeht: ...
Paimon: Hey there, Azariq, Jeht!
Traveler: It's been a while.
Azariq: Haha, hardly that long! Good to see that you're all well. Jeht's really fond of you — we were just talking about you, in fact.
Paimon: Eh? What did you talk about?
Traveler: Is Jeht still angry?
Azariq: Huh? Angry...?
Jeht: ...
Azariq: Oh! She did mention a little disagreement you had, yes... But you know, she talks quite carelessly, but isn't actually good at expressing her feelings.
Azariq: Still, you should reflect as well. Jeht's very concerned about your safety, so you should pay a bit more attention to her suggestions.
Traveler: Sorry, it was my mistake for leaving her out.
Traveler: I'll bear that in mind.
Jeht: Sorry, it was my fault, really. I was... petty. Childish.
Jeht: I knew how important Liloupar was to our mission, but I threw a tantrum anyway...
Paimon: Liloupar says stuff weirdly, and she does use some pretty creepy analogies...
Paimon: But she looked out for us the whole way, so... Well, she's different from the people we've met so far for sure, but she doesn't seem like a bad person!
Paimon: #Whatever the case... It'll be fine. Traveler's important to you, isn't {F#she}{M#he}, Jeht?
Jeht: #Of course. You're my best friends.
Liloupar: ...
Paimon: Yeesh, you're so serious all of a sudden. Paimon doesn't know what to say at all...
Jeht: Ugh, there's no need to be so awkward! I won't get mad anyhow from now on, and you can count on that!
Azariq: Hahahaha! That's right, that's the spirit!
Azariq: Ah, right! About the "Mother of the Jinn"... Is it with you?
Traveler: Yes.
Jeht: Azariq! Didn't Matriarch Babel tell you not to ask that willy-nilly?
Azariq: It's fine, Jeht! I mean, I guided you half the way, so I count as a "companion," don't I?
Liloupar: A "companion," you say? Perhaps you speak too hastily.
Azariq: Eh? The bottle's talking!
Liloupar: Such insolence! If you recognize me not, then your silence shall serve better!
Azariq: Whoa, this is a pretty fierce one for sure... Is that the Mother of the Jinn, then?
Liloupar: I'd watch my tongue if I were you, desert-spawn.
Jeht: This is Azariq, one of my brothers here in the tribe.
Liloupar: Hmph... Well, we could have chosen worse. This one is sturdy enough. A shame that he has too big a mouth, and too small a brain.
Jeht: *sigh* How is talking to her supposed to *not* end as an exercise in frustration?
Traveler: Reckon you just need to get used to it...
Traveler: I feel for you...
Paimon: Hmm, y'know, Jeht, you did find Benben pretty cute, didn't you? How about you just treat her like a Benben that talks! They both fly, don't they? Hehe.
Azariq: Oh, it's fine! Sharp tongues are to be expected of the legendary Jinni... somewhat, I mean.
Azariq: Whatever the case, she's on our side, isn't she? We'll be fine!
Liloupar: On "your side"? Did I mishear you?
Liloupar: Apologies, but you shall not find me on the "side" of those who entreat my master while wearing two faces.
Azariq: ...
Jeht: ...
Liloupar: #My master trusts you, and I trust {F#her}{M#his} reasoning for that. But I will be watching you, Azariq.
Jeht: Heh... Well, I guess that's just what a Jinni's like...
Azariq: ...It's fine.
Azariq: Ah, right. Did anything happen while we were separated? Just curious, I mean.
Jeht: Same here. Did I miss anything?
Traveler: Well, about that...
Black Screen Text: You tell Jeht and Azariq about the ambush in the canyon, as well as Aderfi's departure from the camp...
Jeht: ...
Jeht: So, a traitor, along with accomplices from other tribes... They might be the same bunch I was tracking down previously. It's even possible that they're collaborating with dangerous outsiders like the Fatui.
Paimon: Huh...?
Azariq: Hah, pretty good, Jeht. Made the best of some rather limited information on our foes there.
Jeht: That's not too hard. I've been helping the Matriarch to track and... eliminate traitors, so their movements and patterns aren't that alien to me.
Jeht: My dad and I have also encountered those people who call themselves "Fatui" in the past, so they're no strangers to me either.
Jeht: Still... I ran off in a huff without giving any thought to whether they would act... I'm sorry. That was my mistake.
Paimon: Oh, let's leave that aside for now. It wasn't even your fault...
Azariq: I'm with Paimon. Don't beat yourself up about this too much, Jeht. They seem to have been ordered specifically not to attack you — can't blame you for having lowered your guard there.
Jeht: But as for Aderfi... Since he's fled in secret, it's beyond doubt that he's betrayed us. Those who violate the laws of hospitality and wield their blades against guests are unworthy of the Tanit's mercy.
Jeht: #I'll capture him, Traveler, this I promise. He will not escape the Matriarch's judgment.
Azariq: ...
Paimon: Hoho, Jeht's getting serious!
Jeht: What? You make it sound like I've never been serious!
Azariq: Haha! Becoming ever more the model of a tribeswoman, eh, Jeht?
Jeht: What are you talking about? Aren't I one?
Azariq: That's not what I mean. I'm just glad to see that you're so concerned about your friends.
Jeht: This is also a tribal matter, you know...
Azariq: True... Outsiders are becoming increasingly active in the desert, and as their interference increases, so too do changes of heart and thought.
Azariq: As Matriarch Babel's right and left hands, we should indeed be concerned about such things.
Jeht: Exactly.
Azariq: Ah, right. There's one more thing. It's Wenut season at the moment, so the tunnels they dig are starting to show up all around the desert.
Azariq: Such areas are very dangerous, so we'll have to approach our adventure with more care and avoid them at all costs.
Jeht: Wait. Just Wenut? Don't we always hunt them? They're no threat.
Azariq: That's still no reason to drop your guard.
Jeht: Sure, sure, I get it.
Traveler: What's a Wenut?
Jeht: Oh, them? We hunt them every year, and then we collect their body fat and use that to make spices. We don't produce much, but it can be sold at a pretty price.
Azariq: So we don't really lack anything. We just need to control the Wenut hunting grounds, and our long-term prospects will stay good.
Jeht: City folk love these thick and pungent spices... But ask them about us desert folk, and they'll tell you a different story... We also need to hunt other animals, but the smell Wenut give off is too strong and will chase them off.
Azariq: As such, our spice workers can't take part in hunts, nor can they serve as assassins.
Jeht: As opposed to the scent of mature Wenut, their larvae give off a much gentler scent, which we often use for scent marks to prevent getting lost in caves or ruins...
Azariq: Haha, you used that in the Gurabad ruins back there.
Paimon: But... are they really that dangerous?
Jeht: Not really...
Azariq: For you outsiders, perhaps?
Jeht: But you needn't worry about that! We'll protect you!
Liloupar: Pfft...
Paimon: Eh? What's so funny?
Liloupar: It's nothing... Ah, the children of Apep, reduced to this...
Paimon: Now that you mention it, you haven't said anything in quite a while, Liloupar.
Liloupar: And I for my part was about to ask if you'd forgotten about someone. Well then. Would you like to hear a story?
Paimon: Hehe, sure! As long as you have one to tell, anyway!
Liloupar: *sigh* 'Tis a shame how long I've slumbered. I fear I am not current with the hot topics of the day, and am armed only with some ancient yarns. Will you mind, O master mine?
Traveler: Don't worry, I'm all ears.
Jeht: Don't worry, I've covered my ears!
Paimon: And Paimon's covered h— Waaaait a minute. What are you covering your ears for?
Jeht: The books say that the words of the Jinn have magic in them, and that their stories have the power to lay curses!
Liloupar: And they say also that behavior such as yours is impolite in the extreme! Do not interrupt me, little lady.
Liloupar: Hmm... Now, where should I begin...?
Black Screen Text: As the moonlight paints the stones white, and night wind blows chill, causing the tendrils of the campfire to snap and crackle... Amidst the calls of nocturnal birds winding across the distant sand dunes, the Jinni begins her tale...
Black Screen Text: Thousands of years have passed since the events told of in this tale. The desert had yet to become so desolate, and the oases spread out across the land like glittering jewels...
In those days, the Jinn walked the earth in great numbers, and they lived within the silver night wind and the flowing sands, in the ripples of the unknowable ocean, and in the pattering of the rainforest springs...
Black Screen Text: We Jinn were not ordinary creatures, but we were the servants of the mistress of flowers.
We were untroubled by basic want, nor were we shackled by material thirst. It was "life" itself that greatly fascinated us...
The blooming and wilting of flowers, the gathering and scattering of birds — these were the things that held us in thrall.
Apart from that, only our "true names" could bind us.
Black Screen Text: We were carefree so long as our mistress walked the earth, and we enjoyed her eternal paradise, her love, and her comfort...
But tragedy would come, and our paradise crumbled as the mistress departed... Our revelry turned to mourning, and all that was good and lovely was violently perverted in that anguish...
Black Screen Text: And so we gave Al-Ahmar our true names, and became his servants... For he promised to find us our eternal companion, our true master.
Deluded hope and trust did we harbor in our hearts, and so forsook our freedom, accepting imprisonment within silver bottles and servitude to his realm...
But what was lost was forever lost, never again to return.
Black Screen Text: But do not think that the Jinn were wanton servants.
Only a love bordering upon madness could make the Jinn give their "true names" willingly.
For it was their deep love for the mistress of flowers that drove them to embrace the desert from the first.
Yet, waking to face the tomfoolery of this barren world caused a surly Jinni to fall incurably in love with the shepherd...
Liloupar: Ah, you're awake...
Traveler: A shepherd...?
Liloupar: Not you, no... Hah, but much like you, my master. You were... much like him — as he was once.
Jeht: ...
Liloupar: Well now, girl, does that make you jealous?
Jeht: #No. It's just that I find this story quite familiar...
Liloupar: #That's because this story has happened before, and may yet happen again.
Jeht: #Hmm...
Liloupar: *sigh* To the Jinn, "love" was a terrible chain, driving those who fell into its pit to make sacrifices, like the hyphae of a parasitic insect...
Paimon: Oh boy, Liloupar's at it again with the scary analogies...
Liloupar: Hehe, we Jinn do not have this tedious thing you humans call "shame," so we do not shy away from discussing love, or revealing one's all to a lover.
Jeht: #*cough*!
Liloupar: But to the Jinn, this mad love could not be reconciled to betrayal. Or else, hatred and vengeance three times greater would be sure to follow.
Liloupar: That was the root of the farce that ended Gurabad... Though that is a different tale.
Jeht: Actually, now that you mention it, I'd like to ask a question... Did you really have no other goal in presenting your "true name"?
Liloupar: Hmm? Hah, well, I suppose vigilance is wisdom.
Liloupar: Well, I do have something I seek. I wish to go to the Eternal Oasis, just as you do... There are things there that have been left unfinished.
Traveler: And what would those be?
Liloupar: Forgive me, dear master, if I can only slowly tell you that tale as our journey proceeds. But the time for that has not yet come.
Liloupar: But know this — it is good fortune that I should have met you.
Jeht: Well, since we've got the same goal, let's get along. How about a toast?
Liloupar: And what shall you make this toast with? Me?
Paimon: Pfft... Hahaha!
Azariq: Alright, weird-story-time's over! Let's talk about something more relaxing.
Azariq: #By the way, Traveler, do you play cards?
Liloupar: #He does.
Traveler: How did you know...
Traveler: Sorry, I'm not in the mood to play cards.
Liloupar: Because I wanted to see it.
Azariq: Haha, alright, great. Now, show me what you've got!
Azariq: Not liking camping out here in the desert, I take it? Haha, oh well... Why don't we tell some stories instead?
Black Screen Text: You all speak about the interesting things you've heard about, as well as the hair-raising adventures you've been through. Some absolutely ridiculous hearsay is even mixed in...
The three of you raise toasts to old triumphs, laugh at ridiculous tales, and shed tears and lament the sad stories.
At the end, Azariq closes the proceedings with a joke, and he absolutely kills it.
Black Screen Text: #When the moon hangs highest, Azariq tells a rather coarse joke about a crocodile and a Sumpter Beast, which loses him his blanket-sharing privileges.
Jeht tells you about many trivial but funny things...
She seems to have lived well amongst the Tanit since your last parting.
Black Screen Text: The night flies by as you chat.
As the next morning comes, you are buried in each others' pillows, asleep by the extinguished flame.

## Talk 24

Yuften: Welcome, guests of Tanit...
Yuften: You m—may d—do anything you please here in our camp...
Traveler: What are you up to?
Yuften: Planting crops and f—feeding the fish. Sometimes, I also do some b—b—butchery. Crocodile skin and meat is v—very useful.
Yuften: We get clean spring water all year around h—here, so it's just right for raising crocodiles. Th—that's why we fenced this place up.
Yuften: Crocodiles are easy to care for, and they can be harvested for lots of skins and meat. Unfortunately, f—fields are a d—different story...
Traveler: You have fields around here?
Yuften: We do... but only for testing. Matriarch Babel invited some outsiders to c—c—come and provide us with Anahitian Blessing, and she got all these old books from the city...
Yuften: S—s—so we've tried our hand at farming according to the contents of these books.
Yuften: But the oases in the canyon are too narrow and lack nutrients. We need to find a way to f—fertilize the soil.
Traveler: Tell me about the Anahitian Blessing...
Yuften: The outsiders didn't want to reveal the fertilizer's composition. As such, we've had to rely on the people who provide it to f—fertilize the soil... which isn't good.
Yuften: Th—that's why the Matriarch wants me to d—do some research here to r—reverse engineer our own Anahitian Blessing.
Traveler: I shan't disturb you any longer.
Yuften: Th—that's alright. Please take some crocodile jerky, dear guest. It's just over there...
Traveler: Crocodiles, you say!?
Yuften: Hehe, yes. I—I take care of them. These are quite large and obedient...
Yuften: This one's c—c—called Sedim. Very fierce and strong, and skin's very vibrant. It'll make for a good satchel. And there's that one, Karam. It's small but plump. Rather gentle, too.

## Talk 25

Masseira: Hehe, so it's you... Youngster, I have heard that you and Jeht went into the accursed city. Ah, and you would like to know how I know this, yes?
Masseira: Hunters have falcons and hounds to be their eyes and ears, naturally. But young one, I must remind you that this word, the "curse," comes not out of thin air.
Masseira: A venom, the root of all tragedy, that drives all humans add, is hidden within a facade of flowing gold.
Masseira: Perhaps it shall be so this time as well, that greedy prey shall fall into a trap, where they cannot be saved...

Jeht: #Hah! Let's see what you'll have to say for yourself after Traveler thrashes you.

## Talk 32

Babel: #Traveler, Paimon, you're back!
Babel: Allow me to dust you off. Jeht and Azariq are waiting for you as well.
Traveler: We brought the object that you needed.
Babel: Jeht told me. Thank you both so much.
Traveler: We were ambushed within the canyon on the way back.
Babel: ...What?
Paimon: We were attacked by your people while on our way back! There were lots of people hiding in the canyon, waiting to intercept us!
Paimon: They were pretty scary, too! Do you know what all that was about?
Babel: ...
Babel: No, I haven't a clue how that happened.
Babel: Traitors and exiles turning to banditry on the roads is quite normal, but the canyons here should have a lot of tributaries... It seems that I've underestimated them.
Traveler: This has to do with Aderfi.
Babel: ...What did you say?
Paimon: That's right! We found this!
Black Screen Text: You give Aderfi's letter to Babel...
Babel: Aderfi... This is indeed his handwriting, and it is even signed in his hand. That he is a traitor is beyond doubt.
Traveler: But... What if he's been set up?
Babel: Then he has still stained our honor with his name, and will accept his punishment.
Babel: However... *sigh* He left the camp some time ago, saying that he needed to go get some supplies from outside. I must apologize. I let my guard down.
Babel: You can be sure that we will exile that traitor, however. He shall not be permitted back into the Tanit hunting grounds — save in chains.
Babel: Please rest assured, you two, that I will get to the bottom of this on behalf of our tribe. I will not allow such happenings to go unanswered.
Babel: As for the "Mother of the Jinn"... Can I see her?
Traveler: She's with us.
Babel: Honored Lady Liloupar, beloved servant of Nabu Malikata, founder of Gurabad, eternal prisoner of Ay-Khanoum, Babel of the mortal Tanit tribe seeks an audience with you.
Liloupar: *yawn* Mmm... Hmm? What did you say? Were you calling for me? I don't quite remember all those names.
Babel: Yes. We ask only, Lady Liloupar, that you lead us to the Eternal Oasis, to set us on the path to meet with the slumbering queen.
Liloupar: *yawn* So sleepy... My master, did you wake me to speak with this servant? *sigh* Why do you love consorting with these coarse folk so...
Liloupar: Well, then, Babel. Will you not dance? Amuse us, and we may yet grant you three wishes.
Babel: ...
Liloupar: Hmm? What? Oh, I'm so sorry, you're the mother of this tribe, riiight! Hahahaha!
Liloupar: My apologies. I read the servility in your brows, and merely could not help but wish to see you dance and entertain us.
Babel: I am merely your servant and will listen to all you have to say. I shall follow the dictates of the Queen of All Oases, Nabu Malikata's will with due trepidation, and them I will not defy.
Liloupar: Hah! I shall not be so crude. Save your solicitations. I already have a master, and I do not intend to take on any servants either, so I fear your calculations have come to naught.
Babel: ...
Paimon: (...So Matriarch Babel can grovel too, huh...)
Liloupar: You have yet to see many things indeed!
Liloupar: My master, you hold my true name, I shall do what you, and only you, desire.
Liloupar: The decision shall be yours. I will not speak another word to these foul desert dwellers.
Babel: "Master"... Your "master"...?
Liloupar: #Why, yes indeed, and it is this noble prince you see before you. Now, now, you need not kneel.
Babel: ...
Paimon: (C'mon, say something, why don't you!? Just look at her face!)
Babel: #I understand. In that case... Will you help us, Traveler?
Traveler: I will help you find the Eternal Oasis.
Liloupar: If that is your choice, then I gladly obey.
Liloupar: Well then, I shall lend my aid. A pleasure to work with you, desert woman!
Liloupar: But a word to the wise: nothing save death can break a contract forged by "true names."
Liloupar: And I will be watching you on my master's account... Do not think for a moment that you may wield me.
Babel: ...I understand.
Liloupar: And it is good that you do, dweller of the sands. Now then, do not disturb my rest.
Babel: ...
Babel: So, you have forged a contract with her, then...?
Traveler: Yes...
Babel: Yes, I understand. You have done well.
Babel: Jinn are arrogant, unfettered creatures, and yet you have managed to bind her. You have surpassed my expectations indeed...
Babel: But that is well. Our path to the Eternal Oasis has been made smoother.
Babel: #So please, Traveler, if I may ask something of you... Keep Liloupar loyal at all costs...
Traveler: I will.
Babel: You have my thanks.
Babel: Ah, Jeht and Azariq have returned. You youngsters catch up for now. I'll have to ask for your pardon, I need some time to organize the information you have gathered...
Paimon: Ms. Babel sure is busy, huh?
Traveler: To do otherwise would be looking for trouble.
Traveler: I did it to open the way.
Traveler: I came here to help fulfill Jeht's wish.
Traveler: Sure, have a go.

## Talk 33

Liloupar: Wait but a moment, my master. Something is amiss up ahead...
Paimon: Um... Do we really wanna pass this way, then?
Liloupar: ...It matters not. This is the path we must take, in any case.
Traveler: Is there danger up ahead?
Liloupar: I am sure, my master, that you too are able to sense the wicked intent ahead... But if we might discover who it is that ambushes us, we might yet turn the tables on them.
Liloupar: Things may indeed be perilous ahead, but you, O master mine, are the one to whom I have entrusted my fate. I shall go forth with you, and we shall face any obstacle together.
Paimon: #Just relax! Traveler's super strong, and no matter what, he'll still have Paimon, right?
Liloupar: Hark, what did I say? Prepare yourself, master.
Paimon: Hey, you guys... Aren't you Jeht's buddies?
Paimon: Hey, c'mon, don't scare Paimon here... Why aren't they replying?
Liloupar: Well, if this is what it comes to... Do not forget to leave one alive, master.
Liloupar: We may follow that one's flight to find his allies and servants, and thus destroy their nest in one fell swoop.
Traveler: What have you sensed?
