# Mycological Investigation in The Chasm

Traveler: So, about these mushrooms...
Khedive: No wonder they say you're an experienced adventurer — You came back with new findings so soon.
Khedive: Huh? Are you sure you found them here? How strange...
Traveler: Is it strange for mushrooms to grow underground?
Khedive: That's not what I mean.
Khedive: It's just that they look similar to an indigenous mushroom in Sumeru.
Khedive: I can't be sure yet with what we've got here. If I have enough samples, I might be able to arrive at a conclusion.
Khedive: Speaking of which... Since you found it, you must know where to get more. Could you lend a hand?
Khedive: Bring me enough mushrooms and I'll pay you handsomely.
Traveler: So, how many is enough?
Khedive: Mmm... Lemme think. Please bring me eight for starters.
Khedive: Don't worry. So long as you bring them to me, I'll make sure to repay you in full!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Traveler: Here're the mushrooms you asked for.
Khedive: You have my thanks.
Khedive: With your help, my research is — what do they call it in Liyue? — "as smooth as a cat soaring in the air."
Traveler: Like a winged tiger?
Khedive: Yes, like a winged tiger!
Khedive: What happened to these fungi?
Khedive: How strange. They look almost identical to an indigenous species in Sumeru save for the fluorescein. Why? Is it because they've evolved in the darkness?
Khedive: But why does their look remain the same after the evolution?
Traveler: You've lost me...
Khedive: Hmm... Simply put, fungi evolve to adapt to their surrounding environment, but by the looks of it, this type of fungi is more suited to living in forest environments.
Khedive: That's why I'm so certain of their Sumeru origin.
Traveler: So, why do they glow?
Khedive: Since they aren't an indigenous species of The Chasm, they didn't evolve to glow. Rather, the glowing is a result of some abnormal ecological phenomenon...
Khedive: It's probably because of the fragment that fell from the sky. After absorbing its energy...
Traveler: The fragment?
Khedive: Ahem... Huh? What did you say? Something about a "fragment"? Um, I mean, when the fragments of fungi fell from the sky, they must've...
Khedive: ...Undergone some random mutation.
Khedive: That must be it!
Khedive: Uh... Thank you for collecting these fungi. It's been a busy day. Please go get some rest, you've earned it!
Khedive: I'm gonna study them now, so if you wouldn't mind leaving me alone for a bit...
Traveler: What is it?
Traveler: Is anything not adding up?
