Traveler: Politely, you say.
Kozue: Yes. Do you have any doubts about that?
Kozue: As the hostess of a high-end tea house and the retainer of the Kamisato Clan, being understanding is a necessary virtue.
Kozue: Even if the guest is not an upstanding person, I will still treat them with respect... as long as they know how to be respectful in turn.
