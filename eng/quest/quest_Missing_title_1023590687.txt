# Missing title (1023590687)

Traveler: Have you found that letter?
Yue Chuan: Um, not yet. At the moment, all I've found are these crabs.
Yue Chuan: Darn them, their pincers are plenty painful! And they'll pop right back up after a while even if you throw them to the shore.
Yue Chuan: I'm in a bind as to how to take care of them, so why don't you take them? Mind you don't get pinched, though.
