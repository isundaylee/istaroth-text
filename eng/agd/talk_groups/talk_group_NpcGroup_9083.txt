Traveler: How do you like it here?
Lynette: As long as you let your consciousness freely drift, it doesn't matter where you are.
Lynette: ...Though, according to normal standards, the environment here is quite pleasant indeed.
Traveler: According to normal standards?
Lynette: Pure, clear air, a soft, warm bed, a lot of open space...
Lynette: Had we grown up in an environment like this, Lyney probably wouldn't have been nearly so anxious.
Lynette: ...I seem to have allowed some subjective thoughts to color my review. Please pay it no heed. Objectively speaking, this is a delightful place.
Traveler: And according to your standards?
Lynette: It is well-suited to spacing out. My charging speed is currently 5% faster than usual.
Traveler: What an... interesting metric...
Lynette: ...By my standards, that is the highest praise that can be given.

Traveler: Would you like to chat?
Lynette: ...
Traveler: ...
Lynette: ...Now that's rare. People wanting me to start a conversation is a rather infrequent occurrence.
Lynette: After all, in most cases, this would just mean falling into an uncomfortable silence like this.
Traveler: Do you not like to chat?
Lynette: No, that's not it. You can often find me talking with other girls.
Lynette: They often gossip about the latest issues of serialized novels, or the gossip on who has a crush on whom...
Lynette: Just say "Oh, I see", "Wow, really?", or "Go on!" at the right moment... and the conversation will flow freely.
Lynette: ...It's a great way to conserve your energy. I highly recommend it.
Traveler: Well, if you don't talk, then silence is inevitable...
Lynette: Saying something requires first listening, then analyzing, constructing your idea, and finally speaking out loud.
Lynette: A back-and-forth conversation would require me to go through all the steps very efficiently. Mm... I've always found it quite taxing.
Lynette: ...Also, is it not true some people prefer to chat with someone who listens more than they talk?
Lynette: If you ever have something to vent about, feel free to come and confide in me. I have a lot of experience in comforting others and calming things down.
Lynette: Also, you can rest assured that your secrets will always be safe with me.

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Lynette: ...
Traveler: ...Other than zoning out, I mean?
Lynette: ...If that isn't an option, then I can't really think of anything else to do.
Lynette: Would you like a cup of tea? I can go make one for you.
Traveler: You're the guest. Shouldn't I be the one making tea for you?
Lynette: It's no trouble. For me, making tea is a truly enjoyable activity.
Lynette: I make tea for everyone whenever Lyney receives a guest.
Lynette: Selecting the best tea leaves, testing the water temperature, and observing the steam as it rises from the water's surface... I very much enjoy the whole process. Only with absolute concentration can you brew the perfect cup of tea.
Traveler: Who would've thought the process is so complicated...
Lynette: ...Also, no one will drag me into a conversation when I'm busy making tea.
Lynette: And once the tea is ready, as long as you sit there holding the cup and maintain the appearance of sipping your tea in peace, nobody will try to talk to you.
Traveler: So the point is still to zone out, then.
Lynette: Hehe, I was kidding. Was that surprising? I can crack jokes every now and then, too. I just rarely see the need.
Lynette: But I really do enjoy brewing and drinking tea. I'm able to taste even the most subtle differences in flavor.
Lynette: Considering all the places you've visited, you must have tried many different flavors during your journey.
Lynette: You want to try one of my brews next time you're free? I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.

Lynette: This reminds me of the kind of places Lyney takes me to do street magic.
Lynette: With a parasol for comfort — and without Lyney's constant chatter — I estimate my energy recharge rate will double.
Lynette: I'm gonna sit here and drink some tea for a while. Wanna join me? I remember how much sugar you take in yours.

## Talk 10

Lynette: You're looking in my direction, but the stage is clearly in your peripheral vision. You're hoping to see a show, aren't you...
Lynette: Boop-boop.
Lynette: Standby mode activated while Lyney completes the upstream performance process. Enjoy the show.
