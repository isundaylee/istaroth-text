Hiia: There haven't been any new products lately...
Hiia: Ah, or could it be... that they've all gone and opened new shops someplace else?

Traveler: I somewhat doubt that.
Hiia: You have a point. Surely there isn't a single spot in all Natlan livelier than the Chuwen Fair?
Hiia: Oh... The People of the Springs doesn't count. The people and Saurians back where I'm from are all busy bathing in the hot springs. Aside from Mualani, you could count those who take their business seriously on a hand or two.
Hiia: And even Mualani spends all day away from the store anyway...
Hiia: Hehe, come to think of it, someone like me would already be considered a hard worker back in my hometown.

Traveler: Hard worker? You look like you're hardly working.
Hiia: If making the most of your breaks helps restore your energy so you can work better, then surely resting should be considered part of your job, too?
Hiia: Agh, I shouldn't joke about it. As someone who does night shifts, I'm one to talk...
Hiia: I'll be at the Weary Inn receiving guests in the evening, so if you need somewhere to stay, feel free to come hang out!
Hiia: Uhh, I mean, feel free to come support my work!

## Talk 4

Hiia: Welcome to the Weary Inn!
Hiia: As the name suggests, people feel tired as soon as they arrive here!

Traveler: Huh?
Hiia: Err, not that the place itself makes you tired, I mean.
Hiia: More like, when people find themselves in an extremely comfortable environment, they're more likely to suddenly feel all the accumulated fatigue.
Hiia: So come, come, sit back and relax! If you need anything, just call me.

Traveler: I got hungry the moment I stopped...
Hiia: Hehe. That's quite common, I assure you.
Hiia: That's why you need to pause and check on yourself from time to time.
Hiia: Come on, have a little grub and rest a bit. Only then can you give yourself the best start for the next leg of your journey.
