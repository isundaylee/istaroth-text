# Temaria Game


## Talk 1

Kid Kujirai: #Hi, {F#big sis}{M#big bro}! I have some good stuff here...
Traveler: Thanks, but I'll pass.
Paimon: How pitiful, being forced to do shady business at such a young age.
Kid Kujirai: It's not what you're thinking! I wanted to ask if you wanted to play a game of Temari with me.
Paimon: Temari?
Kid Kujirai: #It's simple, I will hide the Temari somewhere nearby. If {F#big sis}{M#big bro} can find it within the time of a Temari song, you win.
Traveler: Is that how Temari is played?
Kid Kujirai: Huh? An awesome Big Sister adventurer taught me. And she said...
Kid Kujirai: "Kujirai, remember. You must say, 'If you win, you'll get the good stuff.'"
Kid Kujirai: #So, {F#big sis}{M#big bro}, if you win, you'll get the good stuff.
Paimon: #Good stuff! {NICKNAME}, Paimon thinks it's only right to play with children!
Traveler: But I still think Temari isn't played like this...
Paimon: It may be a gameplay that only local people know, let's not care about such details.
Paimon: You're Kid Kujirai, right? We'll play with you!
Kid Kujirai: Yay!
Traveler: Alright then.

## Talk 2

Kid Kujirai: Eh, is it too hard for you...
Paimon: That's because Paimon was just warming up!
Kid Kujirai: #{F#Big sis}{M#Big bro}, do you want to try again?
Paimon: #Of course! {NICKNAME}, we need to show Kid Kujirai how good we are!
Traveler: One more try!
Kid Kujirai: Woohoo! The goal is to find the Temari within the time limit!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Kid Kujirai: #{F#Big sis}{M#Big bro} is amazing, you found it right away!
Paimon: #Hoho, {NICKNAME} is a seasoned traveler who has been to many nations.
Kid Kujirai: Wow! Have you also been to Mondstadt?
Traveler: Certainly have.
Kid Kujirai: That's so cool! I heard from that Big Sister that there are many beautiful places in Mondstadt, like Stormterror's Ruins with super-duper tall towers...
Traveler: It's Stormterror's Lair.
Kid Kujirai: Yup! I wonder if that tower is taller, or if the Almighty Shogun's Tenshukaku is taller...
Paimon: Kid Kujirai, why are you out alone in the wild?
Kid Kujirai: Because when my sister was fishing, she thought I would scare the fish away, so she let me go out to play.
Kid Kujirai: Once, I met that Big Sister who was an adventurer. She saw that I was bored, so she gave me a lot of Temari, and told me to "find greedy travelers to play with."
Traveler: Greedy travelers...
Paimon: We're not greedy! We're worried! Paimon's worried that you might be bored playing by yourself!
Kid Kujirai: #That's right, I think {F#big sis}{M#big bro} is really nice, I'm so happy.
Traveler: Alone in the wilderness...
Paimon: You're a kid alone in the wild, aren't you afraid of running into danger? And you even have "good stuff" on you.
Kid Kujirai: #You're really kind, {F#big sis}{M#big bro}. Don't worry, that Big Sister adventurer taught me. As long as I do something to it, the Temari can turn into a bomb.
Paimon: Eek, that's so dangerous!
Kid Kujirai: It's not! I've blasted away a lot of bad guys, like hilichurls and slimes!
Paimon: You're the dangerous one!
Kid Kujirai: #Oh yes, {F#big sis}{M#big bro}, if you want to play a game of Temari with other friends...
Kid Kujirai: I'll leave a Temari here! Here are the rules...
Kid Kujirai: When you hide a Temari, you have to hide it within the time of a Temari song. The person who is looking for it will also find it within a song's time. That will make things fair!
Traveler: Got it.
Paimon: It's so scary to think that we're actually playing with bombs...
Kid Kujirai: #Don't be scared, {F#big sis}{M#big bro}. Big Sister adventurer told me "Only the bad guys will be bombed. Probably."
Paimon: "Probably!?"
Kid Kujirai: #I'm off to play somewhere else! Bye-bye, {F#big sis}{M#big bro}!
Traveler: Is that so?
