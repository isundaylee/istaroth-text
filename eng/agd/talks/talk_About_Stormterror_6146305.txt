Eury: *sigh* I only realized that those days of window-shopping and haggling with shopkeepers was "peace" when I experienced Stormterror's attack.
Eury: I was originally planning to get my husband to kick his drinking habit...
Eury: ...But in celebration of this hard-won peace, I suppose I can put it off for now.
