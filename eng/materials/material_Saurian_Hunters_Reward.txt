# Saurian Hunter's Reward

Kinich's specialty. The large, richly flavored chunks of meat come in hot... and spicy to boot. Ajaw keeps mumbling by your side. "Consider yourself lucky to enjoy this for free! Why, in days past, we would only reward ourselves thus for a true big-game hunt. Indeed, you should be offering delicious fruit juice unto me as thanksgiving!" To which Kinich helpfully supplies, "Just eat. Ignore his nonsense."
