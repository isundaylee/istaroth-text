# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Which Darshan were you in, by the way?
Sabbah: Oh, I could talk for three whole days about that!
Sabbah: I was with Amurta and specialized in plant evolution, so you could say my work was evidence-based.
Sabbah: That means that it is impossible to reach new conclusions without new material. Simply put, historical samples are necessary to examine historical plants.
Sabbah: But there are only so many fossil samples available, and the Akademiya is limited in its ability to provide new ones.
Sabbah: Those were the circumstances, yet the institute still demanded results.
Sabbah: So some people would just take a previous study, revise or add something to it, and turn it in. You also find that quite pointless, right?
