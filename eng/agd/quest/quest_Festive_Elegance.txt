# Festive Elegance


## Talk 1

Paimon: All the details we need about the ships are on the timetable that Ayato gave us.
Paimon: Let's take a closer look and be sure to pick up the passengers according to the times written on it.

## Talk 2

Yae Miko: Aratani and Kuroda, how are things coming along?
Aratani: All the books and commissioned prints for Yae Publishing House were bound and sent out yesterday afternoon, Lady Yae.
Yae Miko: Very good. And Murata?
Murata: We have already received word from Eipekkusu and Sailing Breeze that the materials are all in place for "Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden With Unlimited Power" and "Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?"!
Yae Miko: Well done. And what about you, Onodera?
Onodera: ...
Yae Miko: Ahem. O—no—de—ra?
Onodera: Oh, uh, yes Lady Yae! Everything is ready for the new issue release party.
Yae Miko: You are the one who organized the plans for this release party. In other words, you are the team's fearless leader now. So please, show some confidence.
Yae Miko: Besides, there's no need to be nervous. This project is destined for success, I feel quite optimistic about it.
Yae Miko: I shall specially grant you leave for the next couple of days, Onodera. Please take the opportunity to have a good rest. After all, you will be very busy on the day of the release party.
Onodera: Yes, Lady Yae. Thank you very much!
Yae Miko: Alright then, is everyone clear about their assignments? Good. We are running out of time, so let's get moving! Chop chop!
Yae Miko: Ah, hello little ones. I take it you have received my commission, hmm?
Paimon: Some organizer you are! It's nearly time for the festival and you're still over here ramping things up for your light novel business! Shouldn't you be getting back to the Grand Narukami Shrine?
Paimon: You weren't thinking of dumping all the festival preparations on us, were you? Hmph, if so, then you can forget it, Paimon won't accept such a commission!
Traveler: Yeah, forget it!
Yae Miko: My my, such harsh words... It hurts to hear that kind of talk from you two. But, as you can clearly see, I'm here working like a dog for the festival, yet you say I'm not doing my job.
Yae Miko: Let me ask you, little ones, who ever said that the festival must involve the Grand Narukami Shrine?
Paimon: Huh? But isn't that a given? This is Inazuma, after all.
Yae Miko: Yes, that is true. But now that the Sakoku Decree has been lifted, Inazuma is no longer the same nation that once resisted change tooth and nail.
Yae Miko: Therefore, rather than sticking to the same old traditional festival, the Yashiro Commission and I have decided to shake things up a little... This time, we'll be holding an international cultural festival, distinctly Inazuman but with a unique twist.
Traveler: International...
Yae Miko: Hehe, I suppose I should start by telling you the origins of the Irodori Festival.
Yae Miko: Legend has it that there were five poets in ancient Inazuma who were supremely gifted in singing and writing poetry. They are known as "The Five Kasen."
Yae Miko: Every year, one of the five would present a collection of the group's poems to the Shogun for review, which would then spark cultured discussions regarding those works.
Yae Miko: Thanks to them, Inazuma's culture blossomed and gained great influence at that time.
Yae Miko: As time passed, people began creating various tales based on The Five Kasen. The Irodori Festival was also developed as a result to show appreciation for their works which so greatly enriched our lives.
Paimon: Sounds like a festival that's really rooted in culture.
Yae Miko: Indeed, to describe it in the words of the ancients, it'd be "refined elegance." Unfortunately, with the flow of time, people have gradually forgotten about The Five Kasen and the festival.
Yae Miko: Which is precisely why I've decided to revive the Irodori Festival by...
Yae Miko: Holding a cultural convention featuring light novels!
Paimon: Wa—Wait a minute... light novels!?
Traveler: What about all that "refined elegance" stuff you just said?
Yae Miko: Please stop looking at me with those baffled expressions. In ancient times, poetry was all the rage. But nowadays, the entertainment format of choice is light novels.
Yae Miko: The important thing is not the format but the creative work itself. It is impossible to come up with anything fresh if you're stuck using some rigid format of the past.
Yae Miko: Speaking of which, don't you think that the concept of "focusing on the now" perfectly suits the current Inazuma?
Yae Miko: And besides, it's a great opportunity to reintroduce Inazuma to all Teyvat through light novels. As they say, it's two birds with one stone.
Traveler: Sounds like...
Paimon: Whoa, that was close... Paimon was nearly carried away by Miko's persuasive tongue.
Paimon: C'mon Miko, you can't fool us! We know you by now, this is all definitely stemming from your own personal interests!
Yae Miko: Haha, I can't deny that my hobbies had no part to play in this. However, regardless of whether it's light novels or a festival, catching people's attention with a fresh concept is the essence here.
Yae Miko: Well, what do you say? Aren't you two even a little curious about what interesting things you might see at the festival?
Paimon: Uh, maybe a little... Ah alright, Paimon's super curious now!
Yae Miko: Hehe. Come, let's pay a visit to the venue in Ritou together. I promise that it will give you a whole new perspective on the festival.
Yae Miko: There we'll meet a special someone who will tell you more about your tasks.
Traveler: A whole lot of thinly veiled self-justifications?
Traveler: Cultural festival?

## Talk 3

Yae Miko: During the Irodori Festival, the area around the Outlander Affairs Agency will become the main exhibition space for light novels.
Yae Miko: Once things are in full swing, not only will there be lots of official and fan-created work on display, there'll also be exclusive giveaways, prizes, and new release parties.
Yae Miko: This small plaza in front of the International Trade Association will be called "The Five Kasen Plaza" during the festival, and nearby shops will be selling special light novel merchandise. You certainly won't want to miss out.
Paimon: Wow, how should Paimon put this... It's definitely not your typical festival, but it sure looks like it'll be quite the party!
Traveler: Yeah, it's like a light novel paradise.
Paimon: Huh? Uh, Miko, what are these blank boards in the center of the plaza?
Yae Miko: Yes, those are—
Kamisato Ayato: Ah, Lady Yae did mention that there would be some reliable helpers coming to assist with the festivities. It appears she meant you two.
Kamisato Ayato: At last, we meet again, Traveler and Paimon. Tell me, how are you faring recently?
Paimon: Oh, it's Ayato! Wow, so even a busy guy like yourself is here to attend the Irodori Festival.
Kamisato Ayato: Preparing festivals falls under the Yashiro Commission's scope of responsibilities. Seeing as Lady Yae has poured her heart and soul into the preparations, I'm obliged to be equally dedicated.
Yae Miko: Hehe. Come now Ayato, we're not strangers here. There's no need to sound so formal.
Yae Miko: We were just about to discuss the boards over here. They're related to our little helpers' tasks, so I'll let you give them a detailed rundown.
Kamisato Ayato: Certainly. I assume you two already know that the Irodori Festival originated from The Five Kasen. These five boards are here for painting their portraits.
Kamisato Ayato: This Irodori Festival is not only the first major festival to be held in Inazuma since the lifting of the Sakoku Decree, it is also an event deeply rooted in culture and the arts.
Kamisato Ayato: Therefore, the Yashiro Commission has personally invited several cultural celebrities from other nations.
Kamisato Ayato: For example, the artist we have invited to paint these portraits hails from the distant land of Mondstadt.
Kamisato Ayato: The Yashiro Commission will arrange accommodations and food in Inazuma for each of the distinguished guests. However, we fear that staying in a foreign land may feel a little uncomfortable.
Kamisato Ayato: Which is precisely why it would be ideal to have someone familiar with both Inazuma and other nations of Teyvat to serve as a guide for our guests.
Traveler: I get it now.
Kamisato Ayato: I knew you would catch on. It is our hope that you would be able to guide the guests from the harbor to their residence at the International Trade Association while providing any necessary assistance along the way.
Kamisato Ayato: This Arrival Schedule includes the details of the ships on which the guests will be arriving. All you simply have to do is go to the docks at the indicated times.
Yae Miko: It's settled then. My, look at the time. I have to meet with my editors, so I must be going now.
Yae Miko: During the festival, most of the Yae Publishing House's editors will be staying near the Outlander Affairs Agency. If you run into any problems, you may find them there.
Kamisato Ayato: This festival requires the full cooperation of the Tri-Commission, and there are still many minor details which require my attention, so I must excuse myself for now. I'll leave the guests in your hands.
Traveler: So this is our commission.
