# The Chosen One's Promise


## Talk 1

Paimon: #Are you alright, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: #What a relief! Traveler was... Uh, it's a bit tricky to explain, but essentially, he saw you and a strange person together in a dream.
Paimon: Did you run into any such strange people onboard the Tonatiuh?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr... Rawr!
Paimon: Eh? So, did you or didn't you?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Roooawrh... Rawr!
Paimon: Ugh, Paimon has no idea what you're trying to say!
Traveler: Well, you're okay, and that's all that matters.
Paimon: Yeah, that's true. What about Bona though? Where did she go?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rooo...
Paimon: Did you guys become separated? Or is Bona really...
Traveler: Perhaps Bona was merely a character from a story.
Paimon: Hmm... You're right. Ordinary people can't live for hundreds of years...
Traveler: We completed her unfinished adventure, at least.
Paimon: Yeah, and we also promised to spread the word about this adventure. Once everyone knows that we found the Tonatiuh, Bona will become a famous adventurer too, right?
Traveler: Then, it's time to...
Traveler: Then, it's time to go to the volcano and find "that person," and then...
Paimon: Yeah. Let's get to the bottom of all this.
Paimon: That said, could that guy have been the Sage of the Stolen Flame? All the messages we encountered along the way were left by him. Paimon's getting more curious by the minute!
Paimon: He also said he takes on different guises, so even if we have run into him, we might not have recognized him...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: #You're curious as well, huh, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}?
Paimon: #Now that we've got all the tokens, let's head to the volcano with {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}, get to the bottom of this, and help lift {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}'s curse.
Paimon: Sorry, Bona! We're taking the Golden Entreaty with us for now. We'll tell you the whole story once we've figured it all out!

#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Roooawrh... Rawr!
Paimon: Alright, you've absolutely lost Paimon there!
Traveler: Well, you're okay, and that's all that matters.
Paimon: Yeah, that's true. What about Bona though? Where did she go?

Traveler: Yeah. Let's get to the bottom of all this.
Paimon: Are you talking about that strange "person" you saw in the memory?
Paimon: That said, who on earth is that guy? The one who left that golden pattern all along our path, maybe? Paimon's getting more curious by the minute!
Paimon: He also said he takes on different guises, so even if we have run into him, we might not have recognized him...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Paimon: #You're curious as well, huh, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}?
Paimon: Now that we've found one token, let's keep up the momentum and find a way to locate another one.
Paimon: #Then, we'll head to the volcano with {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}. We should be able to get to the bottom of everything there, and help lift {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}'s curse to boot.
Paimon: Sorry, Bona! We're taking the Golden Entreaty with us for now. We'll tell you the whole story once we've figured it all out!
