Ooshima Junpei: Well, looks like I found another job... That's good...

## Talk

Traveler: So, about your work...
Ooshima Junpei: Oh, it's you, Traveler! Thanks for introducing me to this job.
Ooshima Junpei: As we agreed, the future maintenance of this shrine will become my responsibility.
Ooshima Junpei: As for my payment... ah, the provisional head priestess says that she'll think of something. I just need to take care of the shrine.
Ooshima Junpei: Hmm. Maybe I should try making a few wood carvings in my free time later.

Traveler: See you.
Ooshima Junpei: See you! You work hard too!

## Talk

Traveler: You know how to carve wood as well?
Ooshima Junpei: Why, of course! I'll have you know that I'm a dab hand at a few different crafts.
Ooshima Junpei: These wooden carvings here were all made by me using Lady Neko in various poses as a reference.
Ooshima Junpei: These carvings are very small, and can be held and played with in your hand, or displayed in your home as ornaments.
Ooshima Junpei: I've been thinking to get someone to help me bring a batch of these — once I'm done making them, of course — to Narukami Island to see if anyone's willing to buy them.
Ooshima Junpei: If we find willing customers, this might become a decent business venture.
Ooshima Junpei: And if I earn some money, I can spruce this shrine up even further!
Ooshima Junpei: I imagine that the provisional head priestess would be most pleased.
Ooshima Junpei: As for the whole payment, uh... I guess I'll just wait for that "Hibiki" person to come back and give it all to me at once, eh?
