Chikya: #Oh, it's you! The young lad with the bright future ahead of him. What's up? Journey got you tired enough for a soak in the hot spring?
Chikya: Well, I haven't learned how to use phlogiston yet, but my back's no longer killing me as much as before. So at least it seems like the healing effect here is better than over at the People of the Springs.
Chikya: Though I'm still a long, long way away from achieving my real goal, not having such a bad back thanks to this hot spring surely counts for about, say... ten percent!
