# Housein's Harra Fruits


## Talk 1

Traveler: About Harra Fruits...
Housein: Ah, saw my commission at Mr. Effendi's, did you?
Housein: Effendi is a man of his word. A commission there really helped me out.
Housein: Did you have ten Harra Fruits?
Traveler: Here are the Harra Fruits you wanted.
Traveler: Not yet.
Housein: Man, I'm serious with my business, you know? And ten is not a large number for a provider.
Housein: It's the least you can provide for a real deal.

## Talk 2

Housein: Thank you. If I round out my spice business, we'll be business partners.
