# Not to be Missed


## Talk 1

Cyrus: You're back. What's the situation?
Traveler: There are still monsters out and about...
Cyrus: Monsters are still in the area, eh? So it seems that the effects of the Storm have yet to disperse...
Cyrus: Hahaha! So there's still time, then â€” time for the Adventurers' Guild to show its quality.
Cyrus: It is up to us to take those monsters out in the wild on, while the Knights of Favonius are still focused on defending the city and the area around Mondstadt.
Cyrus: I understand. Thanks for your help in investigating. I will reconsider the commissions that we will be sending out. Take these as your reward.

## Talk 2

Cyrus: *sigh* Where has that kid Bennett run off to? I hope he didn't run into any trouble.
