Hajime: I'm sorry, but the nearby veins have all been mined, and I don't have any new information on hand, either. Best you come back again later.

Hajime: Ah, are you asking about locations where you can find our locally-produced ores? Well, I do have some intel. It's just that my work here as an apprentice at Amenoma Smithy keeps me ever so occupied...
Hajime: How about this, then? I'll mark these ore locations on your map. Bring them back to me, and I'll see what I can do about them.

Hajime: Speaking of which, my master gave me some Magical Crystal Ore lately. It's quite different from the usual materials I work with, and I'm not as familiar as I could be with it just yet.
Hajime: Let's do it like this: I'll mark the locations of these Magical Crystal Ores on your map, and you can mine them and have a look. If you figure out a way to work with them, it would be great if you could tell me.

## Talk 2

Hajime: Sorry, I have a lot on my plate right now. I can only talk to you while I work. Would you like to buy a weapon? Or do you have a forging request?

Traveler: I want you to forge something for me...
Hajime: Bring me the materials, and I will get to work right away.

### Talk 2 related talk 1

Traveler: *I'd like something made.*
Hajime: The previous job you asked me to do has been completed. See if it's to your satisfaction or not. By the way, do you have anything else for me?

### Talk 2 related talk 2

Traveler: I'm looking for a handy weapon.
Hajime: These are all works of the Amenoma Art that have been approved by my master. Take a gander.

### Talk 2 related talk 4

Traveler: About yourself...
Hajime: Me? I'm just a regular apprentice swordsmith. I do whatever my master tells me to do.
Hajime: As you can see, I practice forging every day, earn a meager salary, and listen to my master's endless lectures...
Hajime: Although I'm the senior disciple, I'm not sure if the master's really counting on me to take over the Amenoma Art.
Hajime: ...Well, whatever. It's not a bad idea, as long as I get paid more.

Traveler: It's tough being a disciple.
Hajime: *sigh* You said it... It'd be bad if my master hears me complaining. If he overhears, he'll lecture me for the entire day.
Hajime: Thank you for your concern. Seeing as you are a Traveler on the move, I'll give these ores to you. If something is wrong with your weapon, they might be of use to you.
