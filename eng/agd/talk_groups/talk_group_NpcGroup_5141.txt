Daniaud: I never expected that so many strange objects could be fished out of the water before I first learned to fish...

Traveler: Mind telling me about your fishing history?
Daniaud: A friend introduced the hobby to me. At first, I thought it to be quite boring — I mean, what else could you call an activity that tests one's patience?
Daniaud: But my friend just waved his hand in a mysterious way, claiming that fishing itself could not encompass the whole hobby.
Daniaud: Just as reading a book could open you to other experiences beyond its contents, he said.
Daniaud: For example, one might consider and analyze the story's backdrop, listen to comments from other readers, view other work derived from the text, and so on.
Daniaud: And the truth has borne his statement out quite nicely, I feel. The simple thought of what I might fish up this time is already very fascinating to me.

Traveler: About the strange objects you spoke of...
Daniaud: Fishermen often say that "fishermen can catch anything — just not fish."
Daniaud: I thought that was just a joke, to be honest, but as it turns out, there really is such a person in Sumeru — no matter what water body he goes to, what bait or equipment he uses, he always catches... Well, not fish!
Daniaud: What an enviable ability! I thought that simply being able to catch clockwork fish here in Fontaine was already quite amazing!
Daniaud: If the things we catch define a fisherman's world, then his world truly is vibrant and full of life.
Daniaud: *sigh* Enough talk. I should do my best as well!

Traveler: Good luck.
Daniaud: Thank you! I am still new to this, so I only managed to fish out some plants.
Daniaud: Uh... But someone told me that algae are not actually plants...
Daniaud: I don't know much about that. They are not of much importance to me anyway. If you don't mind, you can take these.
