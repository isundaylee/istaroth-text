# Saurus Crackers: Yumkasaurus

Crackers shaped like little Saurians. The enticing aroma of butter draws forth the delightful, irresistible interplay between the Cacahuatl and Grainfruit, while the cute shapes make them truly hard to put down... Be that as it may, you received these treats on the parade of blessings and it might be nicer to keep them as an uneaten memento.
