Six-Fingered José: #Hey there, amigo! Are you here to listen to Six-Fingered José's latest composition?
Six-Fingered José: Hehe, fear not. My creations do not disappoint.
Six-Fingered José: When it comes to the Windblume Festival, other bards think love songs. Madre mía, no sense of invention...
Six-Fingered José: I, Six-Fingered José, on the other hand, am not constrained by convention. I wish to eulogize the heroic epics of ages past! The people must remember that this is a day for commemorating heroes and resisting tyrants!
Six-Fingered José: Even if, ahem... I haven't quite finished the last part yet. But once it's complete, it will bring my audience running back!
