# Delicious Squirrel Fish

A hard-to-prepare fish dish. The fish is expertly handled to exhibit an elegant shape; however, the exquisitely balanced sweet-and-sour taste is really where the dish truly comes alive. The culinary skills involved in preparing this dish can impress even the greatest chefs of Liyue.
