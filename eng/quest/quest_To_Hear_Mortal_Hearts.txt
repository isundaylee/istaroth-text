# To Hear Mortal Hearts


## Talk 1

Paimon: Whoa, look at how well-hidden this place is!
Ei: I can't think of a reason anyone would want to build a structure like this deep in the mountains.
Traveler: Maybe to escape disasters.
Ei: I feel something that doesn't belong here... I sense danger.
Paimon: Huh?
Ei: We should proceed with caution. The Kujou Clan descendant may well be in trouble.
Traveler: Maybe to evade detection.

## Talk 2

Takatsukasa Susumu: Almighty Shogun!
Kujou Kamaji: Sh—Shogun, what are you...
Ei: Descendant of the Takatsukasa Clan. Explain what is going on here.
Takatsukasa Susumu: Oh, we're just discussing some minor issues that have cropped up in the Tenryou Commission recently. Really, it's nothing worth the Almighty Shogun worrying about...
Ei: And these minor issues warranted the secluded location and the hiring of ronin and kairagi to keep guard?
Takatsukasa Susumu: Well, there's there's been a lot of turmoil lately. It was just out of security considerations, that's all...
Ei: Silence.
Ei: Descendant of the Kujou Clan. Your turn.
Kujou Kamaji: Alright. I came here intending to negotiate, but it turned out all they were interested in was a written confession from the Kujou Clan.
Ei: A written confession?
Kujou Kamaji: Yes. A statement acknowledging every crime committed by the Kujou Clan since the inception of the Vision Hunt Decree, including all the recent misconduct...
Takatsukasa Susumu: All factual statements of course. Not a single one of them fabricated.
Kujou Kamaji: I can't deny that. But it also emphasizes the Takatsukasa Clan's achievements throughout the document, claiming that they stood steadfast all along and fought back against the crisis...
Kujou Kamaji: These are all falsehoods.
Takatsukasa Susumu: Says who? Why, you two-faced...! You're going back on everything you said!
Kujou Kamaji: I'm just stating the facts. I'm sure the Almighty Shogun can discern the truth. All the Takatsukasa Clan is trying to do is make themselves look good, so they'll be first in line to replace the Kujou Clan!
Kujou Kamaji: Why else would you push a false narrative in the written confession that paints your clan in a good light? And try to make me sign it under duress?
Takatsukasa Susumu: What are you talking about? You're not under duress, we're just negotiating here! You've completely changed your tune!
Ei: I believe I now understand the situation.
Takatsukasa Susumu: Don't listen to his nonsense. I'm sure you're well aware of the major failings of the Kujou Clan. Surely you of everyone knows — not a single word they say can be trusted!
Ei: Hmph. You are quite mistaken if you think your dispute is of any interest to me. Descendant of the Takatsukasa Clan, you wish to become the new Tenryou Commissioner. Do I understand this correctly?
Takatsukasa Susumu: Uh, well... y—yes, of course! It's the eternal pursuit of everyone in the Tenryou Commission to offer our lives in service of the Almighty Shogun!
Ei: Then the situation is not as complicated as you seem to have made it. After all, I am the one who appoints the Tenryou Commissioner. The process is quite simple: Anyone who can beat me in a duel becomes the new Commissioner.
Takatsukasa Susumu: Um, sorry... a duel with the Almighty Shogun?
Ei: The first Tenryou Commissioner demonstrated his will with the blade in his hand. That is why the title has been passed down within the Kujou Clan ever since.
Ei: If you want me to appoint a new clan, then naturally, there must first be a new duel.
Takatsukasa Susumu: I... Uh...
Ei: Do you not know how to wield a blade...? Or do you simply doubt your abilities on account of your advanced age and declining physical condition?
Ei: Here you are talking about offering your life, and yet you are too afraid to face my blade?
Takatsukasa Susumu: Um... Well...
Ei: Well, never mind. What about one of you, then? Anyone who can defeat me, Takatsukasa or not, will be appointed the new Tenryou Commissioner.
Takatsukasa Clan Retainer: ...
Ei: Does not a single person dare to face me?
Ei: ...
Kujou Kamaji: I...
Kujou Kamaji: I will challenge you, Almighty Shogun!
Paimon: Whaaat!?
Ei: Descendant of the Kujou Clan. Regrettably, even if you win against me, it cannot atone for the wrongs committed under the Kujou name.
Kujou Kamaji: I realize that. I don't stand a chance of winning against you anyway. I know full well that the mistakes my father made ought to spell the end of the Kujou Clan's legacy in the Tenryou Commission...
Kujou Kamaji: Even when I was executing the Vision Hunt Decree, I had doubts about my father's decisions. I knew that what I was doing was wrong.
Kujou Kamaji: But that was as far as I went. I doubted, and I ruminated. I understood the situation perfectly well, but I took no action, and I didn't save a single person.
Kujou Kamaji: I accept the Kujou Clan's decline as punishment for my deeds. I can't even say that I failed to prevent it... because in order to fail, you have to have at least tried.
Ei: To be brutally honest... for someone of your strength, there is nothing you could have done even if you had tried.
Kujou Kamaji: Yes... I'm too weak. My father ignores me, my elder brother can't help me, and I even need Ippei to set me straight at times... It's the way it's always been...
Kujou Kamaji: But if nothing else, then right here, right now, in the Kujou Clan's final hours, it is I who represent the clan, like my father before me! His duties are now mine to perform!
Kujou Kamaji: Just as the Shogun said, a forefather of mine once showed his will with his sword...
Kujou Kamaji: Then please, let me, Kujou Kamaji, end the story of the Kujou Clan in the same way that it began!
Kujou Kamaji: This is my last chance to do something!
Ei: This is patently meaningless.
Ei: But I accept. Come forward.

## Talk 3

Ei: Kujou Kamaji is wounded. Descendants of the Takatsukasa Clan, it is your responsibility to take care of him.
Ei: You may not have the courage to challenge me, but I trust that you are capable of attending to a small matter such as this.
Takatsukasa Susumu: Yes, of course. I apologize... I'm sorry. So, so sorry.
Ei: I had heard that the Kujou Clan is no longer fit to shoulder the work of the Tenryou Commission. The search for a successor to the role of Tenryou Commissioner is indeed a matter of great urgency...
Ei: However, following this duel, I have decided to postpone the Kujou Clan's punishment for the time being.
Ei: In the meantime, I expect the Takatsukasa Clan to continue supporting the Kujou Clan as before.
Takatsukasa Susumu: As you instruct, so it shall be done. We would not dare question the Almighty Shogun's will.
Ei: Finally, if you still think you can copy the Fatui's strategy of providing me with deceptive information to produce flaws in my judgment...
Ei: ...You will see me appear once again as I have done today — only next time, my blade will show no mercy.
Takatsukasa Susumu: Understood. Thank you, Almighty Shogun, for your wisdom and mercy!
Ei: That will do. I will have the Okuzumeshuu continue the investigation from here.
Ei: Come with me. Let's find a quiet place. There's something I want to talk about with you.

## Talk 4

Paimon: When it's time to deal with a situation, you're just like the Shogun. So strict.
Ei: You think so? I thought I was rather accommodating. If it had been the Shogun... she would have decapitated Kujou Kamaji without a second thought.
Traveler: He was lucky.
Ei: I do believe he was prepared for that outcome. I could see it in his eyes.
Ei: The Kujou Clan has undergone a dramatic change from its glory days to its present decline. Kamaji is hardly a great heir to the Kujou name, but...
Ei: He has shown me how some things remain the same even as the world around them changes.
Ei: I also have you to thank. The things we experienced out on the streets and the photo you took of me, they helped me come to this realization, too.
Paimon: So what's next for the Kujou Clan? Will they get to carry on being in charge of the Tenryou Commission?
Ei: Not a chance. Even if their heir was someone who showed promise, their past mistakes cannot be erased.
Ei: Still... I will give them a little more time. After all, they are not the only ones who have made mistakes.
Ei: The Shogun does not make mistakes — she is incapable of doing so. But I, as Ei, would like to offer my apologies.
Ei: I have much to contemplate in the days to come. But at least I can now see the way ahead.
Traveler: Will you rule Inazuma directly?
Ei: I think I'll leave that to the Shogun. The greatest threat to eternity is still the erosion that comes with time.
Ei: As I said, the Shogun has a robust system to protect her against modification. This is because I anticipated that I myself would change over time.
Ei: But I've made up my mind. So I will do what needs to be done, no matter how difficult it is.
Ei: Mmm...
Ei: This has certainly been a memorable series of events.
Paimon: Absolutely! You sorted out the Tenryou Commission and the people in the city got to see a happy and healthy Shogun. All the awful rumors will disappear in no time.
Paimon: If you enjoyed your trip, we should get you out again some time!
Traveler: Next time, we'll bring you some souvenirs.
Ei: No need. There's no place for such things in my life.
Ei: Also, please stop making it sound as if I somehow need the company.
Ei: Okay, I'm ready to head back now.
Ei: My period of solitude will now continue, but it will not last too much longer. I will leave you humans to deal with any minor issues in the meantime.
Paimon: Okay, see you next time!
Paimon: Considering a lot of what happened was pretty unexpected, things seemed to have worked out surprisingly well in the end.
Paimon: The only thing left to do is return the Pass Permit to Yae Miko.
Traveler: Next time, we'll bring you some fun little trinkets.
Traveler: Maybe that's what he was expecting.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Miko, we're back! We had a great trip!
Yae Miko: Did you now? Well then, you'll have to tell me all about it.
Yae Miko: Hehe, how amusing. The Almighty Shogun goes downtown and suddenly she's like a wide-eyed country girl trying to find her bearings in the big city. Marvelous.
Yae Miko: What a shame I didn't get to see it for myself.
Traveler: Only you would dare to say that.
Yae Miko: It's fine, she wouldn't mind. Really, she wouldn't.
Yae Miko: So. From what you were saying, it seems that she has finally begun to comprehend what form eternity should take?
Yae Miko: That's the most important outcome of this trip. To be honest, I wasn't expecting you'd make such great progress when I lent you the Pass Permit.
Paimon: Yeah. It seems like she's not gonna force everything to stay the same way anymore.
Yae Miko: To put it nicely, even deities indulge in wishful thinking. To put it more bluntly, there are things that even The Seven can't do when faced with something even more powerful than themselves.
Traveler: The human heart?
Yae Miko: Hehe. Take a guess.
Yae Miko: Anyway. It sounds like you had a very pleasant trip and even had the chance to see Ei's less formal side.
Yae Miko: Next time you wish to see her, you can come and take the Pass Permit from me again. She would never admit to it, but she does, in fact, get quite lonely.
Paimon: What? But she said she doesn't need company...
Yae Miko: Because she is a god. It's not that gods don't need the company of others, just that the idea of a god having company seems indulgent to her.
Yae Miko: But you don't belong to this world. Perhaps you are just the company she needs.
Traveler: The Heavenly Principles?
Traveler: You and the Shogun enjoy teasing each other.
