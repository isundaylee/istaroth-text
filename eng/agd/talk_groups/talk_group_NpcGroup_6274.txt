Temach: We still have a few more flying challenges. Details are written on the board. Give 'em a try if you're keen... Of course, there are prizes to be won.
Traveler: About the Pakpaka Flying School...
Temach: Honestly, I have no clue why it's called that. But speaking of Pakpaka... Have you ever heard the story of Kuntur and the evil sorcerer Rumi?
Temach: The warriors of the tribe were defeated by that wicked mage, and he turned them into Pakpaka... which doesn't sound all that good. Maybe Pakpakas fly very quickly, or something â€” I don't know.
Traveler: About Lamizana...
Temach: Haha... He's a good fighter, but not necessarily a good teacher. And as an opponent in flying competitions... I guess he's passable?
Temach: But I mean, why would you come here if you didn't have issues with flying? So, if I were to be too strict... *sigh* Well, it's not like things like this have never happened in the past.
Temach: That's why I focus on encouraging people nowadays. I'm sure that approach will get results just fine too.
Traveler: Gotta go.
Temach: See you. You're welcome back any time.
