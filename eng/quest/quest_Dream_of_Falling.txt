# Dream of Falling


## Talk 1

Paimon: Look. She's sitting over there... and surrounded by monsters!
Nahida: C'mon, let's rescue her!

## Talk 2

Paimon: She seems to be in the same condition as Ilman earlier.
Nahida: Yes, but luckily, she hasn't been injured or jolted awake yet. Let's carefully move her somewhere safer.
Kathya: See you tomorrow, Professor Aisha...
Kathya: Hmm... Huh? Wh—Why am I back here again?
Traveler: Nobody else is here.
Kathya: Dreaming? But what about Professor Aisha...?
Kathya: Oh, I see. It was all just a dream... Well, that makes sense. After all, it hasn't changed a single bit.
Paimon: Huh? What's "it"?
Kathya: Nearly twenty years, and it still hasn't bloomed... *sigh*
Nahida: Does it have something to do with your dream? Please, tell us what you mean.
Kathya: Ah, sorry, I'm still feeling a little groggy. Please give me a moment here... Whew.
Kathya: Ahem, alright, where to start... Right, this plant... So, Professor Aisha gave me this plant just before she left.
Kathya: She was a good friend of my parents' and my first real tutor. She was also an outstanding Amurta researcher.
Kathya: In addition to her extraordinary academic talents, she was also skilled in combat, and would accept lots of work from the Adventurers' Guild.
Paimon: Oh, so you mean she's left on an adventure?
Kathya: Yes. When I was about ten years old, she told me that she must go look for the secrets of "the Abyss," and that she would be gone for a long time.
Kathya: I grabbed hold of her and wouldn't let go. I didn't know what "the Abyss" was... I just knew that she was like family to me.
Kathya: She hugged me, and we cried for some time until I fell asleep. When I woke up, I was already back home.
Kathya: She still decided to leave, but had left behind a letter for me saying that I was the person she cared for most in this world.
Kathya: She claimed that investigating "the Abyss" could help more ordinary people protect the people and things they care about.
Kathya: She had obtained some important evidence during her past adventures... If she didn't set off right away, she might miss the perfect opportunity.
Paimon: Guess "ad astra abyssosque" isn't just a slogan...
Kathya: She left a seed in the letter, telling me that if it sprouted and bloomed, then she'd come back, no matter what sort of risky situation she was in.
Kathya: She said she looked forward to seeing me all grown up...
Kathya: But strangely, I've tried watering it, feeding it, everything I could think of... but I've never been able to get it to bloom.
Kathya: I even went to ask the Amurta researchers, and they couldn't explain it, either.
Nahida: May I have a look at the plant?
Kathya: Of course. I was hoping the great Dendro Archon could help me solve this problem.
Nahida: Let me see. Hmm, oh...
Nahida: ...
Paimon: Huh, we've never seen that look on Nahida's face before.
Nahida: ...
Traveler: (Wait, could it be...!?)
Paimon: Sh—She looks a little unwell. Um, hold on, we'll be right back!
Paimon: What's wrong, Nahida? You can't tell what's wrong with the plant, either?
Nahida: No, I immediately understood what's happening with that plant... I'm just not sure if I should say it.
Nahida: This plant is not known to the academic world. It's a new species that her teacher managed to cultivate by some special means.
Nahida: Judging by its features, I can tell from the moment it sprouted, it'll never be able to bloom.
Paimon: I—It can't be...
Nahida: It means that this "Professor Aisha" she keeps mentioning might have foreseen the danger, and was prepared to never return.
Nahida: From my experience observing people, she would undoubtedly regard this as a "brutal" revelation.
Nahida: When forced to confront such "brutal" truths, people may break down into tears, talk nonsense, or lose their tempers...
Nahida: #I know she has to face the truth, but at the same time, I don't want to hurt her... Tell me, {NICKNAME}, what should I do?
Paimon: Yeah, that's a tricky one... Seems like you've already got a good idea of the feelings she might experience.
Traveler: I'll tell her.
Nahida: But wouldn't that mean I'm just pushing it all on you? What if she just gets angry at you instead?
Paimon: It's all right. There are all kinds of people, and the examples you observed are just the most extreme cases.
Traveler: I've seen many situations like this before.
Nahida: O—Okay... Thank you.
Paimon: Let's go back and tell her.
Kathya: Huh! It'll never bloom!?
Kathya: But how's that possible? If a plant is unable to bloom, doesn't that mean it can't reproduce, either? All that's left for it to do is slowly wither away!
Traveler: It seems like that may be exactly what your teacher intended.
Kathya: Are you saying... she never intended to return? Seriously? So everything she said was a lie...
Paimon: But she meant well! Since the separation was inevitable, she hoped that you would be able to come to grips with such a cruel parting a little later in life.
Traveler: She really cared about you.
Paimon: Yeah. Her love, care, and attention to you... All those warm moments were real.
Nahida: I guess she had hoped that you could understand and respect her choice after learning the truth.
Kathya: ...I see. Sorry, I don't want to sound ungrateful, but it's just... just so much to take in.
Kathya: The dreams are so beautiful, yet reality is heartlessly cold.
Kathya: I really thought she had come back. I had so much to tell her...
Traveler: I can understand your grief.
Nahida: These dreams may not be as pure and beautiful as they seem. Some kind of power may be exploiting your feelings.
Kathya: R—Really?
Nahida: Yes. So with that in mind, until our investigation is completed, please return to the event and ignore any further temptations from your dreams.
Kathya: I see, thank you for rescuing me and sorry for the trouble. Luckily, the plant didn't get hurt either.
Kathya: Otherwise, I wouldn't have anything left to remember her by.
Nahida: Thanks, Traveler and Paimon. She seems to have finally accepted the truth, but I think she'll still need a long time to come to terms with her feelings.
Nahida: I saw her waver the moment you mentioned love.
Nahida: It was almost like a gentle rain, arriving just in time to put out a fire that was about to spread.
Paimon: It's because people have something called "empathy."
Nahida: "Empathy"? Hmm, I see... This is valuable knowledge indeed.
Paimon: By the way, you said there may be something that's trying to exploit their feelings. Any idea what that might be?
Nahida: Yes. What's common between Ilman and Kathya's cases is that they've both lost someone dear to them.
Nahida: And now... they get to meet the people they cherish in their dreams again, and the people feel more real than anything a regular dream could hope to create.
Nahida: Instead of interpreting it as a result of their longing, I have to consider a more antagonistic explanation... Someone is taking advantage of their longing.
Traveler: But what would be the motive?
Paimon: Yeah, they're just causing these people to dream. What are they after?
Nahida: This is exactly what we need to investigate. Anyway, let's pay another visit to "A Moment of Dreams."
Nahida: I have a bad feeling about all of this... I hope things haven't gotten any worse.
Traveler: We're trying to investigate these dreams.
Traveler: She meant to convey a message through the plant's true nature.
Traveler: There's always a way to work through it.
Traveler: (An expression pleading for help?)
Traveler: You were dreaming just now.

## Talk 3

Nahida: We're back. How's everything here?
Pedrush: Uh, I am so sorry, great Dendro Archon. We're still trying to figure out how to explain the whole thing to everyone.
Pedrush: Because of your warning, we've brought dreamers here even if they were completely unaware of the danger.
Pedrush: But some of them have already fallen asleep, and they haven't woken up for a long time. I fear there's nothing we can do about it.
Pedrush: "A Moment of Dreams" is just a small interest group... We don't have enough staff members to handle this.
Nahida: Just as I expected, it seems my guess was correct.
Pawlin: It's the Dendro Archon. She's back!
Nasser: What happened? Why have we been gathered here?
Nahida: Many of you here have been experiencing some beautiful dreams.
Nahida: But I'm sorry to tell you that based on our investigation, there's some kind of conspiracy behind them.
Nahida: Before we learn the truth, please don't try to recreate the scenes in your dreams. Whatever you see, don't be tempted by them.
Pawlin: Huh? But...
Nasser: I don't think it's a big deal. Aren't we just dreaming? It's not like dreams will have an effect on others.
Nahida: We've already met two people who ran off to the countryside alone and got caught in dangerous situations by falling to the temptations in their dreams.
Paimon: That's right! These aren't just dreams — it's serious!
Nasser: All right... I get it, I get it.
Pawlin: So does that mean once we have some conclusive results from the investigation, we can continue to enjoy these dreams?
Nasser: Yeah, I still want to visit my sister in my dreams...
Traveler: No, not necessarily.
Nasser: I'm sorry if what I'm about to say sounds a little offensive, great Dendro Archon, but...
Nasser: We had a discussion with the folks who just arrived here... In all of our dreams, we were able to reunite with people who were very close to us.
Nasser: They all seemed as if they were alive again, which makes us reluctant to wake up.
Nahida: Yes, that's also what we've observed in our investigation.
Nasser: So, if the results of this investigation would mean an end to those dreams, that'd be quite cruel to us.
Nasser: All of us understand the danger, but... perhaps you can't quite understand just how much those people mean to us.
Nasser: I don't think everyone will be on board with the plan to abandon these dreams for good.
Nasser: Before the conclusion of the investigation, they'll at least want to meet the people in their dreams one last time and say goodbye.
Pedrush: We've never had such a difficult situation before. It appears that not many people are willing to cooperate.
Paimon: So they still want to return to their dreams despite knowing the danger?
Traveler: It's hard to clearly say who's right and who's wrong here.
Nahida: That's right. Compared with these sweet and beautiful dreams, our warnings of danger are dull and emotionless... It looks like the situation will inevitably spiral out of control.
Nahida: The more time we waste, the more people will ignore our warnings and return to their alluring dreams.
Paimon: So, what should we do?
Nahida: ...Seems we have to go into a dream and find out the truth for ourselves.
Nahida: Pedrush, is there anyone here who's experiencing a marvelous dream right now?
Pedrush: Ah, let me think... Yes, this way.
Nahida: Good, please take us there.
Traveler: Everyone has their own perspectives.
Traveler: It will depend on the results of our investigation.

## Talk 4

Paimon: What's wrong, Traveler? You look a little disoriented.
Traveler: ...No, it's nothing.
Paimon: Oh, okay. Just remember that Paimon is always here for you!
Paimon: Anyway, seems like we've made it into the dream!
Nahida: Hmm, I thought we would arrive at some familiar scene, but we seem to have landed in a completely unfamiliar place.
Paimon: Whoa, so many giant plants, even in the sky. Amazing...
Nahida: Theoretically, we should have gone straight into Debbi's dream. Things do seem to have gone a bit sideways here...
Nahida: Anyway, let's see if we can find any leads.
Traveler: It seems this whole dream situation is getting to me, too.
Paimon: Really? Paimon didn't notice anything...

## Talk 5

Kathya: Actually, I can really sympathize with everyone's feelings on this.

## Talk 6

Pawlin: All this commotion is making me wish I could experience this kind of dream, too.
Paimon: No way, not on Paimon's watch!
Pawlin: Alright, alright... No need to get so worked up.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Hey, this place looks familiar! Isn't it Puspa Café?
Paimon: Oh, Paimon sees Debbi. She's right over there! Looks like we've come to the right place.
Nahida: These alluring dreams often portray a scene from real life, which concurs with our previous findings.
Paimon: Really? But what about that space we were in just now?
Traveler: Maybe it was like some kind of hub.
Paimon: You can't mean... this is another collective dream!?
Nahida: Yes, given that so many people have been experiencing these beautiful dreams, I would say it's very likely that they're interconnected.
Nahida: Compared to an interconnected dream, independent individual dreams would be much harder to manage and manipulate.
Paimon: Ah, Paimon gets it now... Well, let's go talk with Debbi.
Paimon: Oh, but there are some other people next to her. Are they dreaming, too?
Nahida: If this space is exclusive to Debbi's dream, then the others beside her are most likely the people she cherishes.
Nahida: Anyway, we should confirm that first, just to be sure.
Paimon: Huh? How do we do that?
Nahida: Just leave it to me.
Traveler: The dreams may be connected.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Wait, weren't we already here a little earlier?
Nahida: This is probably Ilman's dream.
Paimon: Huh? Why would he start dreaming again?
Traveler: Didn't we warn him?
Nahida: Yes, but it seems that the danger isn't enough to stop him from longing for his wife.
Paimon: Based on what we've learned so far, he must be sleeping more deeply for his dream to appear here.
Nahida: But fortunately, he already knows us from before, so hopefully we'll be able to wake him up.

## Talk 9

Emira: You know, I've heard that plants grow better if you play music for them.
Emira: And on that note, it's been a while since I last heard you play.
Moseis: Sorry, I've been a little busy these last couple days.
Moseis: Oh, the Dendro Archon... What a pleasant surprise!
Emira: Hmm? Oh! Welcome, great Dendro Archon! And your companions, too, welcome!
Emira: I'm Emira. I run the flower shop here. And this is my husband, Moseis.
Moseis: Yes, how may we help you?
Nahida: You already know all about me. There's no need for all the pleasantries.
Nahida: Perhaps I should call you, "the dream's owner"?
Moseis: Hahaha, as expected of the Dendro Archon.
Moseis: I'm sorry, Emira. It seems my research has attracted the Dendro Archon's attention.
Moseis: Why don't you go back to the flower shop, I'll come help you a little later.
Emira: Okay, of course, dear. I'll see you later.
Moseis: It appears that I was too naive to think I could deceive the Dendro Archon in person like this.
Moseis: To avoid looking like too much of a fool, allow me to ask the first question: How well would you say you understand this dream?
Nahida: This dream was built by the Akasha, and it has the power to create imaginary people who no longer exist in the real world.
Nahida: As for you... you've found a unique way to become the owner of this dream, going so far as to have even given up the ability to wake up again.
Paimon: Given up... the ability to wake up?
Moseis: Hahaha, impressive! You truly are the embodiment of wisdom.
Moseis: Please, tell me how you were able to arrive at such a conclusion. In return, I'll answer the question you're most curious about.
Nahida: It's simple. Apart from you, this space only consists of real people who are dreaming and imaginary people who were created here.
Nahida: Although you are here and appear no different from the others, I can't sense your dream.
Nahida: How can I wake up a person who's already awake?
Moseis: Fascinating.
Nahida: Since you're the fully awake owner of this dream, it can never collapse from you waking up.
Nahida: Theoretically, this should also give you absolute control over this place. I have to admit, it really doesn't get much better than that.
Nahida: But even knowing all of that, one question remains: How did you do it?
Moseis: Isn't the answer right in front of you, great Dendro Archon? It's because I've dedicated my entire reality to this dream.
Moseis: I uploaded my entire consciousness into the Akasha when it was still running.
Traveler: Your entire consciousness?
Moseis: Actually, this all started because of an accident. My original goal was not about the Akasha or a collective dream...
Nahida: No, you were motivated above all to create a hyper-realistic "person"... The desire to reconnect with a "real" loved one is the one shared sentiment between all our dreamers.
Moseis: That's right. However, human models are too complicated. Only the Akasha has a Jnana Energy supply powerful enough for me to generate and sustain my models.
Moseis: The Akasha is truly magnificent. If I siphoned a minuscule amount of its energy, nobody would even notice. And even this "minuscule" amount of energy was already more than enough for my purposes.
Moseis: Even using just crude methods, I was still able to train a fairly realistic person.
Moseis: I named my first work "Emira."
Paimon: Huh? You mean the girl we just saw!?
Moseis: She and I entered the Akademiya on the same day. Starting with admission procedures, we bumped into each other six times on just that first day.
Moseis: And because of that one day, we eventually went on to fall in love. We studied, conducted research, and made breakthroughs together.
Moseis: Our rhythm was always in step. I felt like we were two separate bodies that shared the same heart...
Moseis: However, Eleazar later took her from me.
Traveler: So you're gathering others like you.
Moseis: Yes, I need more training samples to perfect Emira's personality.
Moseis: I found their details in the Akasha's database. Using the pretext of testing for mental health disorders, I implanted signaling devices in their bodies.
Moseis: This way, I could connect them to a network, and Emira could feel their yearning. Little by little, they helped her to grow and develop a warm, human personality.
Moseis: To improve my efficiency and allow myself to focus on nothing but my research, I uploaded my consciousness as well, and became a part of the network.
Nahida: Hmm, so technically speaking, it's not that you won't wake up — it's that you can't wake up.
Moseis: Yes. Because the Akasha was suddenly turned off, I lost all of my Jnana Energy. I became imprisoned in the very network I had constructed.
Moseis: At first, I panicked. But, after coming to grips with the situation, I realized that I could restart this world as long as I could find a replacement source of Jnana Energy.
Paimon: That means... everyone in the network is providing you with Jnana Energy!
Traveler: That's insane...

## Talk 10

Moseis: Missing text (770079594)

## Talk 11

Paimon: Whew, glad that's over...
Paimon: But what happened just now?
Nahida: He's not very proficient in using the Akasha's technology, and he spent a lot of Jnana Energy creating monsters. Now the system is out of control.
Nahida: All the people he created also turned into monsters, including Emira.
Nahida: It's terrible, even for a dream.
Paimon: Even Paimon's freaked out. Paimon can't imagine what they're going through.
Traveler: It's like a horrible nightmare.
Nahida: The good news is that the chaos seems to have subsided.
Nahida: Now we only need to wake up the people here, and let them return to their real lives.
Moseis: Emira, my dear Emira...
Moseis: They're all gone. It was just a big dream after all.
Moseis: I couldn't change my fate, and my knowledge turned out to be useless. What a cruel world...
Nahida: Do you still think this is our fault?
Moseis: I don't care about that anymore.
Moseis: The Jnana Energy used to sustain this dream has all been transformed into monsters. This dream will soon collapse, and my consciousness along with it.
Moseis: Let me disappear with Emira... I'd rather turn into dust than to ever wake up again.
Paimon: It seems that everything that's happened is too much for him. He's lost all hope.
Traveler: I want to say that he's only getting what he deserves...
Nahida: I think seeing Emira turn into a monster was punishment enough for him.
Nahida: After comprehending the hollowness of the unreal, it's time to revisit the meaning of existence.
Moseis: Existence? Heh, I'm different from the others. I've long given up everything outside of my consciousness.
Nahida: Using my knowledge of the Akasha, I have a way to extract your consciousness from here and put it inside a knowledge capsule.
Nahida: The Akademiya has probably kept your body, so you should be able to wake up soon.
Moseis: No need... Just let me disappear. Reality means nothing to me now.
Nahida: This isn't compassion. I won't let you escape your punishment by simply disappearing.
Nahida: As for your life after that, it will be up to you how you want to exist.
Nahida: Alright, Traveler and Paimon. We should go back.
Nahida: We can finally wrap up this whole thing...
Nahida: ...Huh?
Paimon: What's wrong, Nahida?
Nahida: Oh, nothing. Let's tell the people here to gather at "A Moment of Dreams" after they wake up.
Traveler: But I can't help but also feel sorry for him.

## Talk 12

Debbi: (Huh, how could they be...?)
Debbi: (Well, I guess it doesn't matter...)
Nahida: (Huh? She sounds a little hesitant.)
Nahida: I've confirmed that this dream belongs only to Debbi. Because, I'm unable to hear the thoughts of the other two people with her.
Paimon: So, this is the power of the Dendro Archon...?
Paimon: Paimon had better watch her thoughts from now on.
Nahida: Hehe, don't worry. I don't often use my powers like this... It's rather impolite.
Nahida: Alright, I need to get myself ready... It won't be easy to break it to her, but there's no avoiding it now.
Debbi: Th—The great Dendro Archon! Uh, what brings you here?
Nahida: I'm sorry to interrupt your celebration, but... have you noticed that what's happening here doesn't quite match up with your memories?
Debbi: I—I don't quite understand, great Dendro Archon... What do you mean?
Basimah: I get it. The Dendro Archon is trying to say that it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that we're able to gather here.
Gaspar: Hey, how about a cup of coffee for all of you, my treat! We just returned from a fruitful adventure.
Debbi: Memories, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity...
Nahida: Think carefully. You of all people should know what really happened to them.
Nahida: Are you sure that meeting here and chatting the day away like this isn't just a product of your own wishful thinking?
Debbi: ...
Debbi: Yes, the reports from "The Steambird" were true... The ship they were on struck a reef and sank.
Debbi: And I never heard from Basimah and Gaspar again...
Basimah: Hey, c'mon now. What're you talking about, Debbi?
Paimon: Yeah, trust your memories... Nothing you see here is real.
Debbi: I get it now. This is a dream, isn't it?
Debbi: But since it's my dream, it doesn't matter if this is real or not. I enjoy the way things are here... I no longer have to face the tragedies of real life.
Debbi: These friends mean the world to me. Nobody else can understand me like they do.
Debbi: There's nothing wrong with continuing this dream, is there?
Nahida: I'm worried that if you were to continue dreaming like this, the lines between dreams and reality will gradually become too blurred for you.
Nahida: These dreams will always give you what you want, while reality remains full of pain and difficult situations... If you're not careful, you can get hurt.
Debbi: Don't worry, I still have control. I won't let it go that far.
Nahida: Are you sure?
Gaspar: Hey, how about we put all this troublesome stuff aside and get back to our coffee and snacks, hmm?
Gaspar: Whether it's just a dream or real life, you should be happy.
Paimon: You can't just brush off something like this! We don't even know how you people got here, or where you even came from...
Traveler: Don't push it, Paimon.
Paimon: Ah, sorry! Paimon didn't mean to upset anyone.
Debbi: No, it's alright. I understand that you're just trying to look out for me.
Nahida: It seems that for now, this place is still relatively harmless for you.
Nahida: But I wonder if there's any way to go deeper into the dream...
Debbi: Huh, now that you mention it, I once heard a strange voice tell me that there's an entrance here.
Debbi: I'm not interested in checking it out at the moment, but maybe I'll go in and have a look later.
Nahida: Okay, thanks for your help.
Nahida: Just as I expected, we're only on the surface of this dream. Let's go.
Traveler: These are important people to Debbi.

## Talk 13

Pawlin: What's all the sudden commotion about?

## Talk 14

Debbi: The coffee here still tastes the same as ever, haha.
Debbi: You two have traveled all around Teyvat. Surely, you've all tasted better coffee than this.
Gaspar: I suppose so, but no matter how good things may be elsewhere, nothing beats the taste of home.
Basimah: That's right! It's hard to change your tastes.
Debbi: Anyway, here's to your return home! Welcome back, everyone!

## Talk 15

Paimon: Ilman!
Ilman: Oh, it's you! Incredible, I didn't know you would appear in my dream too.
Paimon: Did you say dream? Wait, so you know this is a dream!?
Ilman: Of course, such good things rarely happen to me in real life these days.
Ilman: Here, let me introduce everyone. This is Maynar, my wife who I mentioned before, and this is our daughter, Haydar.
Maynar: Hello, it's a great honor to meet the Dendro Archon.
Haydar: Whoa, Dad, you know the Dendro Archon!? That's amazing!
Haydar: And what's this? *gasp* Is it a new toy!?
Paimon: No, it's Paimon! Not a toy!
Paimon: Anyway, now's not the time for that! Nahida, this doesn't seem to add up with what we were expecting.
Nahida: Hmm, you're right. Let me think for a bit here...
Traveler: Ilman, did you...
Paimon: Oh, right! We didn't see him in "A Moment of Dreams" earlier. Paimon thought he'd gone home!
Ilman: Sorry, I just had to make sure that Haydar could get a chance to see her mother.
Ilman: I had gotten pretty familiar with the hike, so I brought Haydar with me. I'm just glad we didn't meet any monsters along the way.
Maynar: Yes, I'm glad too. I didn't expect her to grow up so fast.
Maynar: It must have been very hard for him. I regret not being able to fulfill my role as a wife and a mother.
Ilman: No, don't talk like that. Let's leave all that unhappy stuff behind for now. Even if we're in a dream, it's still a blessing that we've been able to reunite in this way.
Paimon: What should we do now? Should we... tell him the truth?
Nahida: You can... You can let me break the news. I should... be the one to do it.
Nahida: I'm sorry, but I should tell you that your dream did not create us. We are real people with our own consciousness.
Nahida: Like the last time we met, we're still investigating this dream, and we've already learned some things about it.
Ilman: So you mean, there's something nefarious with this dream as well?
Maynar: Hmm? Ilman, what's going on?
Ilman: It seems the reunion of our family is destined to only be temporary.
Haydar: Huh? Is Mom leaving?
Nahida: Maybe... But in all likelihood, that is indeed how things will end.
Haydar: ...Ah!
Haydar: No, Mom, you can't leave!
Maynar: I'm afraid I don't quite understand what's going on...
Maynar: Don't worry, Haydar. Mom's not going anywhere. Please don't cry.
Ilman: Maynar doesn't understand any of this.
Ilman: I'm fully aware that this is a dream, so that's why I've never told her the truth, but...
Ilman: Never mind. It's not like I would know what to say...
Ilman: I mean, I don't get any of the complicated stuff, but regardless of whether this dream is good or bad, you're here to resolve it, right?
Nahida: Yes.
Ilman: Then please, let us enjoy this moment for just a while longer.
Ilman: Regardless of whatever caused this dream to come to pass, I feel extremely grateful to have had the chance to reunite with my family.
Ilman: But, does this dream... really have to disappear?
Nahida: I'm afraid so. Sorry.
Paimon: Aww...
Ilman: Okay, I see...
Ilman: Please, come this way. You can go even deeper into the dream by heading in this direction.
Ilman: I have heard that the further down you go, the more pleasant the dreams become... and the more you want to stay.
Ilman: The answer you're looking for may also be found there. Go ahead.
Nahida: Thank you for helping us, and I'm truly sorry.
Ilman: You're welcome. It's not like I have any say in the matter. I'm just an ordinary person, after all. Who am I to interfere with the work of a god?
Ilman: I'll be right behind you. I should at least let Maynar and Haydar know what's going on here.
Ilman: Otherwise, my daughter might be mad at her mother after we wake up...
Traveler: Secretly go back to that place again on your own?

## Talk 16

Paimon: Huh? What are we doing here again?
Paimon: Wait a second!? We were just up there, no... down there... Uh, did we go up or down?
Nahida: Don't panic, this is how dreams work.
Nahida: We've left Debbi's dream, but the dream is still continuing onward. I'm not sure where it'll lead us.
Nahida: This dream has the ability to create imaginary people, which is why people are so unwilling to wake up.
Paimon: If it weren't for what we just saw, Paimon might still find that a bit hard to believe...
Traveler: So what awaits us further in the dream?
Nahida: I have a guess. If these dreams are connected, then there should be some sort of order to them.
Nahida: The fact that Debbi was able to realize that she was dreaming means that she is not very deep in the dream yet.
Nahida: But the space we're in has been turned upside down. Do you remember the characteristics of dreams that I mentioned earlier?
Paimon: Oh right! Dreams are chaotic!
Nahida: That's right. It's possible that we're heading deeper into this dream now, and the deeper we go, the closer we'll get to the essence of the dream.
Paimon: Right, so the answers might be waiting for us deeper in the dream.
Traveler: We should hurry.
Nahida: Yes, and we should get ready for whatever we may encounter.

## Talk 17

Nasser: Sorry, I might have spoken a little out of turn just now.
Nasser: I just think that the gods really don't understand us sometimes...

## Talk 18

Paimon: It's the same place again... This place is almost like a flight of stairs that connects all the dreams together!
Nahida: But they appear to be getting more and more aggressive. Regular stairs wouldn't try to attack us.
Traveler: Let's recap what we've learned so far.
Paimon: Right, something seems to be off about our theory.
Paimon: Ilman is clearly aware that he's dreaming, and he's enjoying it.
Paimon: Rather than dreaming on a deeper level, he almost seemed... more awake?
Nahida: I believe we're on the right track, but we just need another explanation.
Nahida: It's not that the dreams are getting deeper, it's the owners' attachment to the dreams that's getting stronger.
Nahida: But you would never mistake dreams for real life, right?
Traveler: Of course not.
Paimon: Sometimes, Paimon almost wishes her dreams could be real!
Paimon: But it's just a quick thought... It's not long before Paimon's thinking about other things... like Sticky Honey Roast.
Nahida: Listen, we're real beings living in the real world, and that's where our focus should be.
Nahida: This also explains the insubstantiality of our dreams. No matter what they may become, we don't really care.
Nahida: But if we decide to abandon reality and embrace our dreams, then our dreams would become far more substantial.
Paimon: Oh! Wait, Paimon's starting to get it now!
Nahida: Your mind will begin to build the dream far more attentively, which in turn will make it feel more real.
Nahida: Do you remember how the Akasha can turn dreams into Jnana Energy?
Nahida: Constructing a realistic dream consumes a similar energy.
Traveler: Which means...
Paimon: Does that mean there's a "host" of these dreams here like Nilou during the Sabzeruz Festival?
Paimon: If we wake that person up, this collective dream will end, right?
Nahida: Mm-hmm, most likely.
Nahida: But the collective dream in Sumeru City was created by the Akasha, and now the Akasha has been turned off.
Nahida: This has nothing to do with the Aranara, and humans are not capable of creating a collective dream, which means...
Traveler: The host has something to do with the Akasha.
Paimon: Eh? So, did someone manage to restart the Akasha?
Nahida: Mmm... That's impossible, but they are probably a scholar of the Akademiya who had a close connection with the Akasha.
Nahida: Even so... How did they manage to do it, and how did they choose the host?
Traveler: Let's keep moving.
Nahida: Yeah, we haven't gotten to the end yet.
Nahida: Once we know their motive, all the questions will resolve themselves.
Traveler: There's another dream out there that's responsible for this.
Traveler: Although sometimes, I almost wish I could.

## Talk 19

Pedrush: It's hard to talk them into coming here. What's happening is way beyond us.

## Talk 20

Paimon: Wow, a new place!
Paimon: Uh, well, it's just new to Paimon in this dream...
Nahida: This should be the final destination.
Paimon: Eh? Really?
Traveler: It's more ordinary than I imagined.
Paimon: Yeah, these are just ordinary city streets.
Nahida: I have powers related to dreams, so it's usually easy for me to tell who's dreaming and who's created by dreams.
Nahida: I guess only those who have thoroughly accepted this dream will be able to come here.
Paimon: There are so many people here. How can we find the host?
Nahida: Don't worry. I have a way.

## Talk 21

Debbi: I think I need a moment to calm down.
Gaspar: Hey, what's with the sad face?
Basimah: Yeah, there's no need to worry about all that complicated stuff.

## Talk 22

Moseis: That's all there really is to it. I don't think I'm doing anything wrong — I'm just saving them as well as myself.
Moseis: I provide a beautiful dream, and in return, I harvest their Jnana Energy as fuel for the dream.
Moseis: They can wake up anytime they wish. People need to sleep anyway, so why not have some beautiful dreams while they rest?
Anisah: I agree. This is the home we spent a great deal of effort on to build for ourselves.
Kian: Yeah, she's right. We are staying here of our own free will.
Maynar: I don't understand this at all, but I just want to spend some more time with my family. I don't want them to be sad.
Ilman: ...Thank you, dear. Great Dendro Archon, I hope you can understand.
Moseis: You don't need to gather around here. It's alright.
Moseis: The great Dendro Archon is nothing if not kind and considerate towards her people. She won't interfere with what we're doing here.
Paimon: Uh oh, now he's playing dirty...
Traveler: (He used the imaginary people he created to influence the real people.)
Nahida: It seems like I won't need you to answer my last question.
Nahida: You're willing to tell me all your secrets because you have nothing to fear.
Nahida: If you use real people as your weapon and turn them against their archon, then there's nothing the archon can do.
Moseis: They just want to be with the people they cherish. I don't think there's anything wrong with me providing them with that opportunity.
Moseis: They don't wish to eternally part with their spouses and friends. What's so wrong about that?
Moseis: If you understood humans a little better or had also experienced firsthand the absolute devastation of loss, then perhaps you wouldn't be so cold towards us.
Traveler: She's not cold at all.
Nahida: If you had used your talents and determination for a just cause, you could have become a sage of the new generation.
Nahida: Unfortunately, you've committed one of the six cardinal sins of the Akademiya by "attempting the forbidden and fearing none."
Nahida: You equated people's feelings with cold Jnana Energy and deprived them of the pain that they have to face.
Nahida: You lured them into these dreams, and even now remain completely unaware of how evil all of this truly is.
Moseis: Pain? Luring? Those kinds of things haven't existed here from the moment this world was created.
Nahida: She's right here. This is Ilman's child, Haydar.
Ilman: Huh? My daughter? What's wrong with her?
Nahida: This dream relies on a set network, which means that only those with devices planted in their bodies can enter this world.
Nahida: Carefully think back and retrace your steps.
Ilman: I... secretly went back to the mountainside with Haydar. Maynar was already there waiting for me, and Haydar was able to see her mother...
Ilman: Ah...
Ilman: You mean... she isn't actually the real Haydar?
Nahida: No, because unlike you, she can't enter this dream.
Nahida: The moment you came into this dream, it created a "Haydar" to realize your wish of reuniting with your family.
Nahida: So, tell me: Where's the real Haydar?
Ilman: She's still out there on the mountainside...
Nahida: That's right. And she must have been terrified to see her father not in his right mind.
Nahida: Not to mention the monsters in that area... The situation is very dangerous.
Ilman: If Haydar's still out there, then...
Haydar: What're you talking about, Dad? I don't understand.
Ilman: I must wake up right now! I can't leave her there alone.
Kian: ...
Thana: ...
Nahida: It seems the others have also remembered something.
Nahida: People try to avoid pain and stay in their perceived bubbles of safety out of an instinct to protect themselves. This is human nature, but it is also one of their weaknesses.
Nahida: However, why are there still so many people striving to move forward even when they know the path ahead is dangerous and painful?
Nahida: It's because people don't only live for themselves.
Nahida: They have families, loved ones, friends, and communities. They have dreams that they are still trying to achieve.
Nahida: But in this dream, you showed them only the most comfortable and soothing things. This entire world has been built on a foundation of buried and unseen pain.
Nahida: It's all just a well-devised scam.
Kian: It seems like I've stayed in the dream for too long.
Thana: I still have so many things I haven't done...
Moseis: Heh, I thought gods didn't understand humans. That would have explained why they created such a flawed world, where countless tragedies took place.
Moseis: I didn't expect you to arrive at the answer through sheer power of observation... But, unfortunately, it means nothing now.
Moseis: If you wanted to spend a little time in the waking world, go right ahead. In any case, I wanted to spend some time alone with Emira.
Moseis: As long as this dream continues to exist, you'll come back.
Moseis: Humans aren't as strong as you think. Even if you're a god, they won't always listen to you.
Moseis: It's time to purge all the extraneous data and noise.
Traveler: You don't know the first thing about her.
Traveler: (He turned the real dreamers against us.)

## Talk 23

Nahida: Hmm, she's only asleep and hasn't started sleepwalking... It seems she hasn't sunk too deep into her dream yet.
Paimon: Do we also need to fall asleep if we want to go into her dream?
Nahida: Don't worry about that. I'm Lesser Lord Kusanali, after all.
Nahida: Now, don't be nervous. Just close your eyes... imagine yourselves as waves gradually rolling onto the beach.
Nahida: You slowly wash over the shore and sink into the sand...

## Talk 24

Ilman: Haydar...

## Talk 25

Debbi: It's just sleepwalking, they're really overreacting.
Debbi: *yawn* I'm getting really sleepy.

## Talk 26

Nasser: It's just a dream. How bad could it be?

Ilman: Uh, I'm not sure what you're talking about... All we did was walk through that passageway, and here we are.
