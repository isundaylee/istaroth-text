## Talk 1

Message Board: "Hey, old man Okazaki! The Sakoku Decree's history now, so could we get some Dandelion Wine sometime soon?"

Message Board: Don't worry, I remember all your requests.

## Talk 2

Message Board: "So, uh, you haven't handed those things over yet, right?"
Message Board: "I was thinking of throwing them away... When I realize that she could come back any moment now, I feel like those things are a bit... unsuitable..."
Message Board: In that case, allow me to hold on to it. If you wish to take them, you can.
Message Board: Just be sure to regret nothing.
Message Board: "I'll... I'll think about it some more..."

## Talk 3

Message Board: "Mr. Okazaki, thank you for the guidance and your explanations. It was quite enlightening. I shall certainly continue to support your business going forward."
Message Board: Oh no no. It's quite an honor to receive such flattering words from the Tenryou Commissioner's strong right hand.
Message Board: If anything troubles you in the future, please do not hesitate to talk to me. I will do my best to help.

## Talk 4

Message Board: "Regarding the damage to the furniture caused by my drunk son a few days ago, I will pay for them in full. May the Kamisato Clan please accept my sincere apology."
Message Board: You are too kind, Sir Madarame. It was nothing.

## Talk 5

Message Board: "The Sakura wine and Sakura Mochi were excellent. Thank you for serving us."
Message Board: I should thank you for coming.
Message Board: "I must say that the wine tasted a bit different tonight. Was that on purpose?"
Message Board: Thank you for trying the wine! It was indeed specially prepared by myself.

## Talk 6

Message Board: "The food stalls here on Narukami Island really are good. Man, if only my home had such fine taverns."
Message Board: "I know, right? Mr. Okazaki is such a friendly man. Don't see that much on Narukami at all."
Message Board: "Oh, come on, don't say that. I mean, as a general (material redacted), I've met a lot of friendly people."
Message Board: "Come on, do you really have to redact that nowadays!?"
Message Board: It does seem that we've been playing host to all manner of strange new customers since the ceasefire was signed...

## Talk 7

Message Board: "I will be stationed at Tatarasuna starting tomorrow. It will be a difficult parting for me."
Message Board: "I hope that my sister will manage the family business well, but the economy hasn't been doing well lately. It won't be easy for her."
Message Board: "I wish that the war would be over soon so that I can come home to share the family responsibilities."
Message Board: Lad, don't worry! I am sure that you will complete your responsibilities successfully, and that you will return home soon!

## Talk 8

Message Board: "Tengu of the Kujou Clan, hear me! You'll pay for taking away my Vision! Don't you forget about our duel!"
Message Board: "I'll be waiting for you! Think long and hard about whom you've offended each time you come through this door!"
Message Board: Dear guest, although I don't know what Madam Kujou Sara has done to you, you are always welcome here to relax.
Message Board: "Haha, of course! This is Mr. Okazaki's place after all!"

## Talk 9

Message Board: "Sorry, old man Okazaki. I had to eat my words and come back."
Message Board: Ah, come now, see what I told you? And look at you â€” you've grown quite a bit since you left, haven't you?
Message Board: "The things that last are less than few, I look upon tombs to comfort find."
Message Board: "But today spring has come anew, and in its light, we leave the ice behind."
Message Board: "That last bit feels forced."
Message Board: Oh, come now, don't make life difficult for an old man just because you're a person of letters.

## Talk 10

Message Board: "When shall the spring flowers bloom? The worries in my mind are boundless."
Message Board: The remnants of snow on the tree branches do seem like flowers.

## Talk 11

Message Board: "Finally, the Uyuu Restaurant once again, at last! Mr. Okazaki's as friendly as he ever was, and the wine's still excellent!"
Message Board: Haha, you are exaggerating, dear customer. By the way, it has been a while since I heard the stories of Haishan.
Message Board: "'Good men don't brag about past valor,' Mr. Okazaki. Stop listening to my brothers when they talk about silly things!"
Message Board: Well, what is an old man to do, when you have never told any of those stories yourself?
Message Board: "Haha, stop teasing me!"
