It's raining!
Oh no
Paimon forgot to bring an umbrella...
Come on
Let's hurry before it rains harder!
Ugh, it's raining again?
I've had enough of this weather
There go my travel plans...
Did you read the news this morning?
Quick
Put away everything on the clotheslines!
When is this rain going to stop...
Hydro Dragon, Hydro Dragon, don't cry!
They're planning to reanimate the monster...
We have to report this to the Chief Justice
The Fortress of Meropide...
It's a good place for me
He owes me so many answers...
Neuvillette?
You could say he's the real symbol of Fontaine's justice
Watch him closely
He could be trouble
How can two completely different species possibly coexist?
Who's been threatening Melusines?
Show yourself!
You will see much
In the human world
From the delightful to the depressing...
And one day, when you have dwelt among humanity long enough
You will be placed to bring judgment over all
As the spokesperson for Fontaine's past
Good morning, Monsieur Neuvillette!
The rainy season's almost over...
The skies are supposed to clear in a few days
I hope you find time to enjoy the sunny days ahead
