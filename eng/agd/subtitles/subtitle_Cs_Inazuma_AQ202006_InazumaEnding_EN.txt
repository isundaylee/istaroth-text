As promised, the Raiden Shogun abolished the Vision Hunt Decree
Finally, her people's wishes penetrated her locked heart
Beyond the Plane of Euthymia, she saw what eternity means in the eyes of the world
When one's fervent ambition burns brightly
The gods will cast their gaze upon you
Some ambitions
Have the power to heal wounds
To bring victory
To inspire hope
But some ambitions
Outlive their masters, long after the soul ascends
They remain as they were in the beginning
Burning bright and true
For all eternity
