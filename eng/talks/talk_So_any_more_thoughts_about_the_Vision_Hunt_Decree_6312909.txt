Traveler: So, any more thoughts about the Vision Hunt Decree?
Tejima: When Lord Kujou came to collect our Visions, he said that this was a necessary step to achieve Eternity.
Tejima: I don't really understand these grand ideals... I'm just an ordinary person. But I guess Eternity is something that never changes?
Tejima: Something that never changes... I feel like I'm very close to becoming something like that...
Tejima: My heart is like stagnant water due to the lack of drive and ambition. I can't feel sadness or happiness. It's like I'm dead inside...
Tejima: I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing. All I can do now is to accept it as my way of life.
Tejima: Maybe something will change again if more extraordinary events occur... You know, such as your appearing in our village.
