# Guy in the Background


## Talk 1

Quinn: Ooh... The sweetness of the freshly squeezed fruit really takes the edge off of the fiery liquor. It goes down smooth, but still has a kick to it.
Quinn: This is some masterful mixology right here! I could serve this Mondstadt Sunset as-is! But where does it get its name?
Quinn: If you look carefully, you can see the fruit juices settling in the liquor. Don't you think it looks like the view from Starsnatch Cliff at sundown as the sunlight pours out over Mondstadt?

## Talk 2

Quinn: Whew, this drink doesn't pull any punches... If anything, the cool of the dandelion seeds seems to add to the fieriness of the liquor! My tongue is numb, but I can't tell whether it's the burn or the chill...

## Talk 3

Quinn: Hey! This is just straight liquor — you call this mixing a drink!?

## Talk 4

Quinn: What a novel sensation. Thick foam, refreshing beer and some crushed sweet flower too... A session beer through and through!

## Talk 5

Quinn: The taste is passable at best, but just look how beautiful it is... The key to making a good Mondstadt Sunset, apart from making sure it's well shaken and stirred, is to let it sit long enough for the juices to settle...

## Talk 6

Quinn: This is... just straight liquor, no? I can't see anything special about it.

## Talk 7

Quinn: Which is why I ask, how can you call this a mixed drink?

## Talk 8

Quinn: Ooh... The texture is like that of regular beer, but where is that residue coming from? Did you put something in it?

## Talk 9

Quinn: Haha... Whatever this is, it sure isn't a Mondstadt Sunrise! You used the wrong ingredients, didn't you?

## Talk 10

Quinn: ...This is just straight liquor!

## Talk 11

Quinn: Oi! At least put something else in the mix. All this is is straight liquor!

## Talk 12

Quinn: Haha, gotta love a good old beer— Hang on, what's this sediment doing in here...

## Talk 13

Quinn: What in Teyvat have you put in this!? My tongue is all numb!

## Talk 14

Quinn: My oh my... That was simply— Oh no! It's all gone...
Quinn: Make me another, won't you? Just one more, just like the last one... Please!

## Talk 15

Quinn: Hmm... Nothing to write home about. But surprisingly good for a beginner!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Guy: *sigh* Standing here on guard duty, day in, day out... It really doesn't give me much detail to write about...
Guy: ...In fact, it gives me precisely zero details to write about.
Traveler: What's wrong?
Guy: Oh, um... My father — his name is Tunner, he works at Dawn Winery. He was thrilled when I joined the Knights of Favonius; every time he writes to me now it's all he ever asks about...
Guy: But all I do is guard the gate! And a side gate at that... We hardly ever have anyone coming through this way.
Guy: Obviously my father is eagerly anticipating big news of my heroic exploits... Meanwhile, here I am managing the affairs of a gate.
Guy: His health isn't great, and I'm a bit concerned that he'd take a turn for the worse if he knew the reality of my situation. So when I write to him, I tell him that I'm out there with the cream of the crop, fighting battles and all that...
Guy: Now I've got myself into a position where I'm forever telling him all these tall tales without a shred of evidence, and I think he's starting to have his doubts.
Guy: If you're preparing to go off on an adventure, could you bring me back a trophy? It would help bolster the credibility of my letter...
Traveler: I'm on the case.
Guy: Thank you so much.
Traveler: Do it yourself...
Guy: There might not be much room for advancement when you're guarding a side gate, but this is the job I've been assigned to.
Guy: I'm not about to abandon my post... If I lose this job, my father loses his mind...

### Additional Talk 2

Guy: Let me see... Start me off with a firm arrowhead this time round.
Guy: I've heard from the fellow knights that you can find them on the bodies of hilichurls. It's not like I've had the chance to test that theory out in battle though...
Guy: They say that you find them all the time... Even then, I don't have the chance to get one myself.
Guy: All of this because my father says things like, "the future of our family rests on your shoulders..."
Guy: When you've found it, I'd be grateful if you could deliver it to my father for me, along with the letter itself.
Guy: Oh, and please don't open the letter. My father is quite sensitive to things like that — he'll think it's been tampered with.

### Additional Talk 3

Guy: This time help me look for a Damaged Mask, will ya?
Guy: Supposedly you can find them on the bodies of a lot of hilichurls... Not that I have ever done that myself.
Guy: It should be enough to stop my father from worrying — that is, as long as you lead him to believe that I didn't actually do nothing.
Guy: ...Even though I never DO do anything besides guard this here gate.
Guy: When you've found it, I'd be grateful if you could deliver it to my father for me, along with the letter itself.
Guy: Oh, and please don't open the letter. My father is quite sensitive to things like that — he'll think it's been tampered with.

### Additional Talk 4

Guy: Let's see... Get me some Slime Condensate this time.
Guy: My fellow knights inform me that every time you finish dealing with a slime, the most annoying thing is then dealing with the Slime Condensate.
Guy: I've also heard that slimes are always cropping up around the Dawn Winery. I'm sure it will please my father to see evidence of me supposedly having fought them off.
Guy: When you've found it, I'd be grateful if you could deliver it to my father for me, along with the letter itself.
Guy: Oh, and please don't open the letter. My father is quite sensitive to things like that — he'll think it's been tampered with.

### Additional Talk 5

Guy: This is a bit of an ask, but this time maybe you could get me a divining scroll.
Guy: I hear that hilichurl shamans sometimes carry them around. I don't think they use them for anything though.
Guy: I would love to see for myself... But as long as this gate's around, I won't have the chance.
Guy: When you've found it, I'd be grateful if you could deliver it to my father for me, along with the letter itself.
Guy: Oh, and please don't open the letter. My father is quite sensitive to things like that — he'll think it's been tampered with.

### Additional Talk 6

Guy: Erm... This might be a bit of an outlandish request, but can you get me a heavy horn?
Guy: Apparently those heftier-looking hilichurls tend to carry them around.
Guy: My fellow knights say they're very intimidating as enemies go, and that it takes everything you've got to defeat one in battle.
Guy: My dad would be thrilled at the sight of a war trophy taken from one of them. But since it's highly doubtful I'd ever have the chance to pick one up myself... all I can do is ask for your help.
Guy: When you've found it, I'd be grateful if you could deliver it to my father for me, along with the letter itself.
Guy: Oh, and please don't open the letter. My father is quite sensitive to things like that — he'll think it's been tampered with.

### Additional Talk 7

Tunner: Greetings, honored guest! Welcome to the Dawn Winery...
Traveler: This letter is from Guy.
Tunner: He wrote me a letter? ...And he got you to deliver it?
Tunner: So he's been out vanquishing hilichurls with the other knights, eh?
Tunner: He's only just joined up. Is he really going on quests already?
Traveler: He took this as a trophy.
Paimon: That Mr. Guy is a pretty mega awesome fighter. He beat up a whole camp of hilichurls just like that!
Paimon: We were nearby, we saw the whole thing with our own eyes!
Tunner: Oh, I see. Erm... It really is from a hilichurl, then...
Tunner: Hmph, it's not much of a trophy though. If I was any younger I'd have no problem going out and getting one myself!
Tunner: But I suppose it shows the young'un is trying his best.
Tunner: Honored guest, thank you for your trouble! Would you care to rest here for a while?
Traveler: No need.
Tunner: Of course, you must be anxious to get back. Don't let me keep you, then.
Tunner: Please, take these for the journey. And you can keep the trophy, too — an old man like me doesn't have any use for it.
Tunner: The Knights of Favonius... Keep at it, you young rascal.
Traveler: Do you want to send him a reply?
Tunner: No... he'll need to try a bit harder than that!

### Additional Talk 8

Tunner: Greetings, honored guest! Welcome to the Dawn Winery...
Traveler: This letter is from Guy.
Tunner: He wrote me a letter? ...And he got you to deliver it?
Tunner: He says he's fought in many battles alongside the other knights, out in the wild...
Tunner: But he only just joined. How on earth did he suddenly become such a seasoned warrior?
Traveler: He took this as a trophy.
Paimon: Mr. Guy is a super-duper warrior! The hilichurls had him surrounded on all sides... But he didn't bat an eyelid, he just coolly worked his way through them one by one!
Paimon: We were nearby, we saw the whole thing with our own eyes!
Tunner: Goodness... Well, he's certainly been working hard... This is the genuine article...
Tunner: And from the looks of it... these are hard to come by.
Tunner: The young'un seems to have learned the meaning of grit, then... He's growing up, finally...
Tunner: Honored guest, thank you for your trouble! If you could wait here a moment, you must let me fetch you something to drink?
Traveler: No need.
Tunner: Okay... You need to get back, I assume. Then don't let me hold you up.
Tunner: Please, take these for the journey. And you can keep the trophy, too — an old man like me doesn't have any use for it.
Tunner: If he keeps up the good work, he'll have a bright future ahead of him...
Traveler: Do you want to send him a reply?
Tunner: Erm... No, I'll leave it. That young rascal is probably too busy to read it, in any case.

### Additional Talk 9

Tunner: Greetings, honored guest! Welcome to the Dawn Winery...
Traveler: This letter is from Guy.
Tunner: He wrote me a letter? ...And he got you to deliver it?
Tunner: Dear father... Defeated a group of slimes... Here's hoping that's the last Dawn Winery sees of them...
Tunner: Wow, it was only a throwaway comment I made about that, but he really took it to heart...
Traveler: He took this as a trophy.
Paimon: Mr. Guy squashed those slimes to smithereens without even breaking a sweat!
Paimon: It was all over in seconds. Bish bash bosh. He moved like lightning!
Paimon: And after he'd beat them he just looked at the carnage he'd left behind and said, "maybe now my father can finally have some peace..."
Tunner: Hmph. Well if he's got the time to worry about me, his job must be too idle.
Tunner: At least he's becoming more mature now though. More knightly.
Tunner: Honored guest, thank you for your trouble... Would you care to rest here for a while?
Traveler: No need.
Tunner: You're in a rush to get back? Then I won't delay you.
Tunner: Please, take these for the journey. And you can keep the trophy, too — an old man like me doesn't have any use for it.
Tunner: Tell him to keep up the good work from me. And that he should visit home when he has the time...
Tunner: In fact, no, just tell him to keep working hard.
Traveler: Do you want to send him a reply?
Tunner: Uh... Not right now. I'll write to him soon though.

### Additional Talk 10

Tunner: Greetings, honored guest! Welcome to the Dawn Winery...
Traveler: This letter is from Guy.
Tunner: He wrote me a letter? ...And he got you to deliver it?
Tunner: Hilichurl shaman... I have heard the folks at the winery talk about them.
Tunner: He's already going up against that kind of enemy at his level!?
Traveler: He took this as a trophy.
Paimon: Those hilichurl shamans might be real tough guys... But fortunately Guy was an even tougher guy!
Paimon: Honestly, he threw them around like ragdolls. They didn't last long!
Tunner: Well, well, well... My young'un's becoming more of a knight by the day.
Tunner: If he keeps this up, he might just make it big time!
Tunner: If you could please wait here a moment; put your feet up while I get you a bite to eat...
Traveler: No need.
Tunner: Oh, you have other business to attend to? I do hope it didn't put you out too much to come all this way just for an old man like me...
Tunner: Please, take these for the journey. And you can keep the trophy, too — an old man like me doesn't have any use for it.
Tunner: Finally, the family's fortunes are taking a turn for the better...
Traveler: Do you want to send him a reply?
Tunner: Hmm... I won't bother, the young rascal's probably got far better things to do than read a letter from his old man.

### Additional Talk 11

Tunner: Greetings, honored guest! Welcome to the Dawn Winery...
Traveler: This letter is from Guy.
Tunner: He wrote me a letter? ...And he got you to deliver it?
Tunner: Fought bitterly... Awarded a commendation...
Tunner: Hmph, my young'un's always been an arrogant show-off... I would have thought he'd know to curb it in now that he's a Knight of Favonius and not a little boy!
Traveler: He took this as a trophy.
Paimon: Guy defeated a suuuper scary monster!
Paimon: We were right there beside him, fighting tooth and nail! It was a hard-won battle...
Tunner: I've heard of them before... That rascal! Taking on monsters of that caliber, it's just reckless.
Tunner: He got lucky this time, but he might not be next time... I need to teach him a lesson. Ambition is great, but recklessness simply won't do!
Tunner: That said, the Knights of Favonius must be pleased to have found someone like this... Anyway — can I get you a drink?
Tunner: As it happens, I have a bottle here from the boss himself. It's still unopened.
Traveler: No need.
Tunner: Oh... Yes of course, you need to be on your way. Don't let me hold you up... You will take a little food for the journey though, won't you?
Tunner: Please, take these for the journey. And you can keep the trophy, too — an old man like me doesn't have any use for it.
Tunner: Knights of Favonius... What was I thinking, did I put too much pressure on him?
Tunner: There's no need to put his life on the line like that...
Traveler: Do you want to send him a reply?
Tunner: I'll write him a letter shortly. I need to tell that rascal he needs to not get ahead of himself just because he's shown a flair for combat. It would be terrible if something happened to him...
Tunner: Sorry, you don't need to be subjected to my ramblings. I will let you go now...

### Additional Talk 12

Guy: With a trophy to go with the letter, my father's sure to be convinced.
Traveler: What kind of trophy do you want?

### Additional Talk 13

Guy: Have you delivered the letter and trophy to my father?
Traveler: Not yet.
Guy: Firm arrowheads can be found on the bodies of defeated hilichurls. Hilichurl Shooters, to be specific.
Guy: When you've found it, please deliver the trophy and letter to my father.
Guy: This is all because my dad says things like "the whole family is counting on you," and "I believe you're going to become the strongest knight in all of Mondstadt one day..."
Guy: And yet right now all I'm good for is guarding this gate. I wonder how things will go in future...
Guy: *sigh* I wonder what I should do...

### Additional Talk 15

### Additional Talk 17

Guy: Have you delivered the letter and trophy to my father?
Traveler: Not yet.
Guy: Heavy horns you can find on the bodies of defeated mitachurls.
Guy: Be warned though, they're exceptionally strong. If only I could defeat one myself one day...
Guy: What am I saying. That's purely fantasy.
Guy: When you've found it, please deliver the trophy and letter to my father.
Guy: This is all because my dad says things like "the whole family is counting on you," and "I believe you're going to become the strongest knight in all of Mondstadt one day..."
