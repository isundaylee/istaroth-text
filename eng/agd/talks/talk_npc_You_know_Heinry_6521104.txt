# Talk Dialog

Traveler: You know Heinry?
Denichere: Yeah. We were both on the research team that developed Fonta.
Denichere: The Institute didn't take the project very seriously and we couldn't get any resources or support... But the work was easy and fun.
Denichere: Of course, when Fonta became a major commercial success the Institute started paying more attention.
Denichere: After that, we founded the Fonta company, with the Institute's support... Although in practice we were managed by the Institute.
Denichere: As for Heinry... All he thinks about is Fonta, so he doesn't care about any of that.
Denichere: But as for me... Ah, forget it. Let's talk about something else.
