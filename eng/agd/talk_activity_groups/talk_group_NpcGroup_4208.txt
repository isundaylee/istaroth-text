Aranishat: Aralila! The next match, Aranishat will hide like raindrops in the river.
Aranishat: Aralila can't find a raindrop in the river, so Aralila will lose!
Aralila: Aranishat, silly. Raindrops don't always fall into rivers, they get stopped by leaves, and flowers.
Aralila: Aranishat will hide like raindrops on the leaves, and Aralila will see Aranishat, easily.
Aranishat: Well... Then Aranishat will hide like a seed in the soil.
Aralila: Hmm... Aralila needs to think before searching, but Aranishat will lose!

Aranishat: Lost to Golden Nara, but happy.
Aranishat: But always losing, Aranishat doesn't want it. So Aranishat is training Ararakalari with little Nara... So that Aranishat won't be found.
Aralila: Aranishat weak, little Nara don't want to play with Aranishat.
Aranishat: Aralila lost to Golden Nara, Aralila weak, too.
Aranishat: But Golden Nara enjoyed playing with weak Aralila.
Aranishat: So little Nara will play with Aranishat and Aralila, too.
Aralila: Well... Aranishat is right. Then, let's visit little Nara together.
Aranishat: Yes, let's go together.

## Talk

Aranishat: How many times did Aralila lose? Did Aranishat win?
Aralila: So many matches. Who won? Who lost? Aralila doesn't know!
Aranishat: Huh? Forget it! Happy Festival Utsava, more important than winning.
Aralila: Aranishat... really has a point.
Aranishat: Aranishat and Aralila both won, twice. All Aranara, and friends of Aranara, all won, for many times!
