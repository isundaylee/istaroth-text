# Talk Dialog

Traveler: What's this place?
Maksim: Oh, this is the greatest place in all of Liyue.
Maksim: Ah, a venue like this would be an impossibility in the bitter cold of Snezhnaya.
Maksim: Ahem... Although I originally intended to do business here in Liyue, I must say that I have forgotten all such thoughts already...
Maksim: Even if Lady Ningguang herself were to summon me to the Jade Chamber to talk business, I may not go.
