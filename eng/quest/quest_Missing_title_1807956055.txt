Traveler: The Forest Watchers might have a problem with that.
Gulabgir: Thâ€”They can't know it, for sure!
Gulabgir: I bumped into a long-tailed Forest Watcher once and got my noggin beaten. It really hurt!
Gulabgir: But if you think about it, it's actually quite some memory, to be dragged by rescue dogs all the way to Gandharva Ville. You should try it sometime.
Gulabgir: Just kidding! It's important to listen to the Forest Watchers for your own safety.
Gulabgir: After all, the rainforest is full of both safe ingredients that can make a delicious meal and inedible stuff one should avoid.
