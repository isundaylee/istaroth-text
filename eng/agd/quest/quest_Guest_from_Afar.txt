# Guest from Afar


## Talk 1

Verr Goldet: What a colossal nuisance...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Verr Goldet: Oh, is that one of our guests? My apologies, things have been awfully unusual around here lately...
Verr Goldet: Our guests keep getting attacked by monsters nearby. Naturally, many are now less inclined to stay here.
Verr Goldet: If this pattern continues, things will eventually escalate out of control.
Verr Goldet: Judging by your attire, you are a traveler, correct? Would you mind taking care of this on the inn's behalf?
Traveler: Okay.
Verr Goldet: Thank you. You're very kind.
Verr Goldet: So it's better that you deal with it instead. I will be sure to arrange adequate compensation.
Traveler: How dangerous are the monsters?
Verr Goldet: Not very. In fact, they are the lesser of my concerns.
Verr Goldet: The bigger issue is... if any of them was unfortunate enough to run into a certain young gentleman...
Verr Goldet: His method of dealing with monsters tends not to consider the best interests of the surrounding area or the people in it...

## Talk 2

Verr Goldet: Is it done?
Traveler: Not yet.
Verr Goldet: Time is of the essence here. The young gentleman tends to show up without warning and disappear without a trace. There's no telling when he'll be here next.
Verr Goldet: And in the event he does show up, that'll be us out of business for a while.

## Talk 3

Verr Goldet: Is it done?
Traveler: Yes.
Verr Goldet: Wonderful! Well, that's a load off my mind. Business as usual once again.
Verr Goldet: Here. Your compensation, as agreed.
Verr Goldet: Hmm? Oh, the young gentleman? I would have thought you'd seen him around.
Verr Goldet: Perhaps you've noticed him resting on the roof of the inn? He does that occasionally.
Verr Goldet: But if you do notice him, try not to disturb him. He prefers to be left alone.
