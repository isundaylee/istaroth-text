Matsumae: I don't know what kind of outfit Miss Ayaka will wear in the final exhibition match...
Sae: Ah, just as I thought. You don't even bother to go for a walk, but now you're interested in the swordfighting competition all of a sudden just because Miss Ayaka would be there!
Matsumae: Bâ€”But it isn't just me! Avid swordsmanship enthusiasts like yourself are in the minority in Inazuma now. And I was the one who woke up early in the morning to get tickets to the exhibition match.
Sae: Okay, okay. I didn't mean to blame you. It's rare that we share a common interest, and we agreed to watch the match together, not to argue. Maybe through this, you will actually become interested in swordsmanship.
