Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>Is there anything you'd like to do?</color>
Yanfei: Actually, I was thinking... Do you want to come fishing with me?
Yanfei: Just the two of us, no one else. Not even your little friend here.
Yanfei: Why not? Well, if you must know...
Yanfei: It's no fun fishing by myself. No matter how many I catch, I only ever get to share them with Granny.
Yanfei: Because, as you know, I can't reveal my true power in front of clients or friends.
Yanfei: So whichever way you look at it, it seems you're the only suitable candidate there is.
Traveler: Feels more like I'm a last resort than an ideal candidate...
Yanfei: No, no!
Yanfei: Argh... Okay, okay. I just want to get out and have some fun with you.
Yanfei: Peacefully, without anyone else interrupting. Just the two of us...
Yanfei: You'll have a chance to see what I'm truly capable of, not just professionally...
Traveler: I never doubted you in the first place...
Yanfei: Oh, really...?
Yanfei: Then it's settled! I should warn you though, I have a tendency to view arrangements like these as contracts... No ducking out.
Traveler: But I am pretty good at fishing myself.
Yanfei: Oh ho? Well then, if I wasn't fired up before, I certainly am now!
Traveler: Feels like you're making this up as you go along...
