Traveler: How's Hiiragi Chisato doing?
Sasaki: After that whole hullabaloo, she seems to have completely changed, and has taken to settling the clan's affairs with great drive.
Sasaki: She has taken up all the things that would be the Commissioner's duties, and she has performed very well indeed.
Sasaki: She is very talented, this much I can tell. Though road ahead may be long... But I'm glad that she took this step forward.
