Esther: This is terrible... What am I going to do...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Esther: It's my beacons! I've gone and left a whole load of them up on the mountain!
Esther: There's no way I can continue my research now... *sigh* And after all the money I spent on them, too...
Traveler: What exactly happened?
Esther: Well, I wanted to do some research into conditions on the mountain — the climate, the environment, and so on. So, I invested in an expensive set of survey beacons.
Esther: Then, I scaled the mountain with a team of explorers. I was just putting the beacons in place when we were set upon by a huge group of monsters — they came out of nowhere...
Esther: I didn't manage to grab them all before I left. The explorers insisted that we leave immediately.
Esther: They also said they're not going back up there any time soon... But what about my beacons? The monsters will smash them to pieces!
Esther: Can you go and collect them for me? Please, I promise they're very easy to find.
Traveler: Alright then...
Esther: Thank you a thousand times over! No, a million times!
Traveler: What's in this for me?
Esther: Oh, uh... a reward, of course! I'll make it worth your while, I swear...
Esther: So, thanks in advance.

Esther: Ugh, just as I expected... With only a limited number of beacons, the accuracy is nowhere near good enough. There's no way I can use this as a reliable altitude measurement.
Esther: Unless...
Traveler: ...Unless?
Esther: Unless a fearless adventurer can scale the highest peak and place a beacon there for me.
Traveler: Like who?
Esther: Like you! Please, help me out one more time. All my other beacons keep getting destroyed by monsters, so this is the only way to reduce the margin of error in my measurements.
Esther: All you need to do is place it at the summit. If you succeed, I promise I will reward you generously!
Traveler: Like me?

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about this mountain...
Esther: Oh, interested in Dragonspine, are you? Interesting. You might have some potential as a geographer...
Esther: I became a researcher out of curiosity concerning the source of Springvale's spring water — that source turned out to be the melting snow of Dragonspine.
Esther: In order to study Dragonspine's environment more deeply, I prepared some Frostshield Potions, but it turns out the cold here is so intense that even potions are useless against it...
Esther: They serve no purpose with me, so I reckon that you should take them. They won't be enough to resist the cold here on Dragonspine, but they might be of use in your future adventures.

Esther: I never thought that I would see such a sight in Mondstadt...

## Talk

Traveler: What are you mumbling about?
Esther: Oh, hello. I'm an environmentalist and researcher of geography. I'm currently investigating the terrain here.
Esther: To find a snow-capped mountain right here in Mondstadt, given the climate in the rest of the region, is really quite fascinating.
Esther: I've seen similar circumstances elsewhere in the past, such as the Chasm in Liyue, so there may be some similarities in their respective terrain features...
Esther: I wanted to go up the mountain to do some proper research, but I was stopped by that Knight of Favonius. A real spoilsport, that one.

Traveler: See you around.
Esther: Alright, take care now.
