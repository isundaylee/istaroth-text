Traveler: Why the long face?
Hongyi: *sigh* Something's been really bothering me.
Hongyi: It seems like the water supply at Feiyun Slope's been contaminated. Smells like there's something rotting in there.
Hongyi: It's getting difficult for those poor folks to get water now. They have to go all the way to Chihu Rock, or even further afield.
Hongyi: What's worse is some people are turning it into a money-making opportunity. Charging ridiculous prices to bring water to the elderly, to women and children, anyone without the strength to fetch it for themselves. It makes me sick...
Traveler: How did this happen?
Hongyi: I don't know for sure. It's unclear whether someone did this on purpose, or if not, what else might have caused it.
Hongyi: If it turns out someone sabotaged the water supply, they're gonna wind up in prison for life. That's according to the Urban Areas Sanitation Act, as amended by Ningguang herself.
Hongyi: Clause twelve is as follows:
Hongyi: "When water's natural purity is preserved, disease cannot fester. But when sullied at its source, it gives rise to all manner of plagues and pestilences. Therefore, let the one who pollutes a water source through negligence be shown leniency, but let any that would willfully pollute a water source be shown no mercy whatsoever."
Traveler: Have you found a way to fix the problem?
Hongyi: Well, I'm still working on it, but...
Hongyi: I'm just a rank and file soldier, so all I can really do is to pass incident reports up to my superior, who will then pass it up to his superior...
Hongyi: The one in charge of land and livelihood management among the Liyue Qixing is the Yuheng — that is to say, Lady Keqing.
Hongyi: But things have just been happening one after another in Liyue Harbor, and the Qixing have so many things on their plate. Who knows when they'll receive my report...

Traveler: See you.
Hongyi: See you. Remember — sullied at source means plagues and pestilences. Be very careful where you get your drinking water from during this time.
