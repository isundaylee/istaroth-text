Namaka: Hello there. This pool has been specially set up for Koholasaurs, so the water might be a bit hot for humans.

Traveler: Thanks for the reminder.
Namaka: Don't worry about it!
Namaka: Actually, it's not that humans aren't allowed in at all. After all, it's an artificial hot spring, and it won't burn you to a crisp like a natural one would.
Namaka: But as you can see, there's not much space around here, and building a hot spring somewhere far away from a natural water source is quite a hassle.
Namaka: So we've all come to a tacit agreement to give these Saurians a bit of space. They enjoy rolling around and resting here, plus they're not running around fighting or causing havoc.
Namaka: Would you like to hang out with them? You're free to do so, but I wouldn't recommend getting in any water fights, and you mustn't cause a nuisance for anyone else nearby.
