Soncoyoc: Price cut, price cut! Once they're gone, I'm gone! It's now or never, so don't miss out!
Traveler: So you do business here?
Soncoyoc: It's not like I'm in anyone's way, is it? Besides, selling's never a problem for someone with as solid a reputation as mine.
Soncoyoc: Not gonna lie though. Working the graveyard shift day after day is tough stuff. One of these days, I'll get a message to Hawka asking him to send someone else to replace me.
Traveler: So the things you sell here are all completely legit, yeah?
Soncoyoc: Yes, and why wouldn't they be? I sell invigorating potions for people and delicious Saurus crackers for Saurians — all one hundred and ten percent above board.
Soncoyoc: Aside from these finished products, I also sell alchemical materials. We've got everything from Butterfly Wings to Loach Pearls, so whatever you need, just ask — there's nothing we can't get our hands on.
Soncoyoc: Oh, except, if you're into the same kind of stuff as Ixtelo, I don't wanna hear about it.
Soncoyoc: Though we might seem shady ourselves, that guy's "gem" dealings... well, even we won't turn a blind eye there.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Soncoyoc: Take care.
