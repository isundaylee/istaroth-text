# That Which Our Ancestors Entrusted

Tsuyuko: A breeze from the south blew across Watatsumi Island today â€” a sure sign that friends would come visit.
Paimon: Every time you say something like this, that means things are about to get busy... for us.
Tsuyuko: Oh, don't say that. Haven't we had a fruitful partnership? The most fruitful sort, in fact.
Tsuyuko: That said, I do have something to ask of the two of you today.
Tsuyuko: It is told in my family that apart from the Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri, we also added a different set of trials. One unrelated to Watatsumi Island's survival, but instead, related to the truth.
Paimon: Another... set of trials?
Tsuyuko: Now that the island is no longer under existential threat, I would just like to tell you this. Consider it our clan's duty.
Tsuyuko: You can go to the place they call the Serpent's Heart. The clues to this second set of trials is hidden there.
Tsuyuko: ...Well, that's a relief! Guess I can safely hand this crushing responsibility on to my future daughter now.
Paimon: ...Is that how you pay respect to your ancestral mission?
Paimon: Paimon still doesn't get you even after all this time, Tsuyuko...
