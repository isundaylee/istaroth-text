# An Artist Adrift


## Talk 1

Julien: #Paimon, Traveler, you're here! Ah, indeed, one needs friends when on a journey outdoors.
Paimon: Well, we did agree to show you the way, didn't we? Guiding people around is a walk in the park for us! Even though we'll be walking in a desert...
Paimon: But are you sure you want to go back to Fontaine so soon? You made it all the way to Sumeru, after all. There's still so much to see here!
Traveler: The rainforest has some nice views.
Paimon: There's lots of trees and rivers!
Julien: They all sound really nice, but I feel that... I haven't made proper preparations for travel. This trip might've been a failure, but I suppose I did learn a lesson or two...
Paimon: Oh, um... In that case, there's also great stuff to see nearby! It would be a pity if you missed them all.
Traveler: Paimon's recommendations are never wrong.
Julien: If you insist... I guess it would be rude if I were to refuse.
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon's Teyvat's number one guide, so leave the guiding to Paimon! Just remember to keep up.
Traveler: The desert has some fascinating sights.
Paimon: Sand and ruins as far as your eyes can see!

## Talk 2

Paimon: They say that artists will observe their subject from many angles before they start. Is that some sort of... "stereotype"?
Paimon: We could have a look around first, and if that fails, we can find a vantage point with a better view!
Julien: That sounds like a good idea. I'm ready to set out.
Paimon: #Hehe, shall we race to the destination? Are you ready, Traveler?

## Talk 3

Paimon: This place is filled with nature's scent! Doesn't it just make you feel like sketching? Doesn't it make you feel inspired?
Traveler: Now that's a stereotype.
Paimon: Um... But it does make Paimon wanna pick up a brush! This place is so full of vitality, and the colors are so vivid...
Traveler: Ahem.
Paimon: Oh...
Paimon: Paimon's sorry... Paimon didn't mean to...
Julien: Haha, it's fine. I just see something different, that's all. We can all appreciate beauty, right?
Paimon: That's right! Paimon loves this place. It's almost as if it can purify your heart and soul.
Traveler: Not that you need it, Paimon.
Julien: My friends, thank you for showing me such kindness — even to someone like me, who has failed to tell you the truth from the beginning.
Julien: You are both indeed pure of heart.
Paimon: Hehe... No need to exaggerate so much. Oh, and there are actually more unique sights than this!
Paimon: #Paimon's sure you know what she's referring to, Traveler. Let's show it to Julien as well!

## Talk 4

Traveler: Let's go!
Paimon: Let's go!

## Talk 5

Paimon: We previously agreed to guide Julien, and he should've recovered from his injuries by now, right? Why don't we go see him?
Paimon: If he's learned his lesson, he should be waiting for us at the seaside camp, right?

## Talk 6

Traveler: Let's make some preparations first.
Paimon: Alright then. Let's go once we're ready!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Julien: One of the good things about leaving the city is not having to specially prepare dog food. Pepper's very capable, in any case, and can procure its own meals.
Julien: The bad thing, though, is that I lack any talent for combat or cooking. I suppose "city trash" is a fitting name for one such as myself...
Julien: ...
Julien: I should just focus on recovering.

### Additional Talk 2

Dog: (Looks at you expectantly.)

### Additional Talk 3

Julien: Phew... I didn't think that drawing was such a taxing thing to do. If I had known that, I would've...
Paimon: Looks like that was still a bit much for Julien...
Julien: Well, I did just... recover from my injuries... *pants*
Julien: But the sights here are truly unique. Indeed, I think it's strange that I never noticed them before...
Paimon: The view's pretty good up ahead as well. Let's head over there — but be careful, okay?
