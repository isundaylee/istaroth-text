Albedo: I was reading an alchemy paper recently, and was particularly interested in the section on Targeted Integration of Hidden Effects of Composite Alchemical Ingredients.
Albedo: Some details of the experiment weren't expounded on in full, although I was able to follow along and bridge most of the gaps. But I'm keen to learn more about what happens during the actual mixing stage. I'll have to take the time to recreate the entire experiment in full, then I can observe it for myself.
Albedo: Oh, you'd like to watch, too? Certainly. I'll let you know when I plan to conduct the experiment.
