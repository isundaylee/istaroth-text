Neuvillette's specialty. He claims he specifically selected the purest, chilliest waters from the highest mountains to create this exquisite and matchless treasure. Though it does have a refreshing quality, as for how the overall flavor of the soup is no different from ordinary soups... It's probably best not to mention it.
