# Immernachtreich Apokalypse


## Talk 1

Narrator: "The people celebrated and worshiped the Prinzessin's authority, and followed her call to migrate to the sacred land that would eventually be known as the Immernachtreich."
Paimon: It really is the Immernachtreich!
Mona: Mm, it really looks the part... I'm quite impressed.

## Talk 2

Narrator: "We established a nation on the Holy Land, revered the Prinzessin as The Absolute One, and introduced poetry, theater, and adventure to the Kingdom, laying the groundwork for the Immernachtreich."

## Talk 3

Leon (???): Someone, please, help me!
Paimon: Uh, isn't this a statue?
Leon (???): Please don't refer to me like that! My name is Leon, and I am a knight of the Immernachtreich.
Paimon: A knight? But you don't look like one...
Leon: You can't tell? Anyway, please don't speak ill of Sire Ozvaldo. He personally designed and distributed the armor for Die Nachtraben Ritter.
Traveler: "Sire Ozvaldo"?
Mona: #Traveler, you must have heard that one before, surely? Oz's full name, "Ozvaldo Hrafnavins."
Traveler: I remember.
Xinyan: Oh... So "Megistus" was the easy pronunciation...
Kaedehara Kazuha: I agree.
Mona: Haha, or so it seems...
Leon: Dear friends, I apologize for interrupting your lovely conversation, but I believe you haven't been informed that the gate ahead has been locked.
Paimon: Yup, that's news to us.
Leon: I'm hoping you'll be kind enough to save me, and in exchange, I'll gladly teach you how to unlock the gate.
Mona: Well, I guess we'll have to save you then.
Traveler: Well, now I know.

## Talk 4

Leon: Valiant heroes... No words can express how grateful I feel right now. Thank you very much.
Leon: Remember, this is the password that unlocks the gate. "May my people be freed from the shackles of ancient decrees."

## Talk 5

Paimon: Looks like it's a dead end ahead. There's only a book.
Xinyan: Do you think what we just heard is the story from the book?
Mona: So the "Holy Land" in the book's title refers to the Immernachtreich. This book sings the praises of the Prinzessin from the perspective of the people in her kingdom.
Traveler: I guess this is kind of an autobiography...
Kaedehara Kazuha: We're on the last page of the book, but the story doesn't seem to have ended.
Paimon: What happens next? Paimon wants to know what happens next!
Kaedehara Kazuha: I guess we'll have to keep exploring. As for this book... wait, I have an idea... Now that we've finished it, let's close it.

## Talk 6

Mona: Huh? We've been transported again, but we're not back on the beach.
Paimon: We are somewhere in... Mondstadt.
Fischl: Greetings, Honorable Kaiserin der Verurteilung.
Fischl's Mother (???): Amy, dear, I've made Steak and Fisherman's Toast. Come on, eat up before they go cold.
Fischl: Ahem! Mother...
Fischl's Mother (???): Oh, look at me, being so forgetful. Ahem! Dost thou knowest, Prinzessin der Verurteilung, that the hour of luncheon encroaches?
Fischl: Of course, Mother.
Fischl's Father (???): Ah, behold the view from the window, a delight to the senses! Prinzessin, Kaiserin, would you care to join the Kaiser der Verurteilung for a grand royal picnic? We shall enjoy the scenic view and partake of the delicacies granted to us by the heavens.
Fischl: Yes, I shall gladly join you!
Mona: ...
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...Oh.
Xinyan: Uh... does anyone wanna say anything about that?
Traveler: ...
Xinyan: Okay, I'll bite. So "Amy"... that's Fischl's real name?
Paimon: Seems like it. The other two voices were probably her mom and dad.
Mona: ...Why are all of you giving me that look!?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Forgive me if this comes across as rude, but... is your surname truly Megistus?
Mona: Hmph, you think I was bluffing? My full title is and always has been "Mona Megistus, the Astrologist."
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...My apologies.
Xinyan: Don't you think that's a bit long?
Mona: Well, it's a special case. Only geniuses get titles like this.
Paimon: Well, that makes no sense...
Mona: What are your thoughts on the scenes we just witnessed?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Well, it seems that "closing the book" is one way of affecting change in this mirage.
Xinyan: Well, I think it's sweet that Fischl's parents are willing to play along with her.
Mona: They probably didn't indulge her forever. Based on the voice, this was surely a memory from her childhood? It's a different story now she's grown up.
Paimon: You know a lot about Fischl, Mona!
Mona: After all, we've been friends for quite a while.
Mona: Speaking of...I wonder where Fischl is now?
Kaedehara Kazuha: That voice mentioned that she was heading out. We may as well go outside, and see if we can find anything.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Oh, we're back.
Paimon: Wait, why are we back? We haven't finished the story yet!
Mona: This feels as awful as purchasing a counterfeit astrology tutorial, or realizing you've forgotten your wallet in the middle of dinner...
Paimon: ARGH!
Mona: Argh! This is torture!
Xinyan: I think they're a little bit upset.
Kaedehara Kazuha: To be honest, I also don't like to read books that end on an unexpected cliffhanger.
Xinyan: Haha, no one likes that. Alright, let's enter the mirage again.
Paimon: Good idea! Let's go!
Xinyan: ...Eh?
Kaedehara Kazuha: We're still here, it's not working
Xinyan: That's odd. We were able to enter earlier, but now, we can't.
Mona: Why!? Why are we being denied the opportunity to finish the book!? This is pure sadism!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm... Maybe it's because we've already reached the end of this book.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Before leaving the mirage, we saw that the book had been flipped to the final page. I believe "Hymn of the Holy Land" is divided into multiple volumes.
Paimon: It's like one of those sneaky light novel marketing schemes... "If you want to know what happens next, please buy the next volume." Yuck.
Mona: Hmph! I have to see the ending.
Arnold (???): Oh, oh, yes, the ending. Everyone wants to see how the books ends.
Mona: Huh? Who's there?
Arnold (???): Oh, oh, heavens above, she saw me. Stand up straight, stand up straight.
Mona: You're...
Arnold (???): I'm "Ask-Me-For-Directions Arnold".
Paimon: That name's a little on the nose!
Mona: So, Arnold, let me ask you something...
Arnold: It's "Ask-Me-For-Directions Arnold"!
Mona: ...So, Ask-Me-For-Directions Arnold, let me ask you something!
Arnold: Yes, Ma'am!
Mona: Are there other volumes of "Hymn of the Holy Land"? Where can I find them?
Arnold: Oh, oh, you're asking the right person. "Hymn of the Holy Land" is the sacred scripture of the Immernachtreich. There are three volumes in total, with the other two stored in two high locations in the castle.
Arnold: If you wish to find the second volume, you must climb to the very top floor of the tower.
Mona: Tower? You mean, that tower over there?
Arnold: That is, indeed, the tower where the sacred scripture is stored. If you look closely to the cave right over there, you'll find a secret passage that will swiftly take you to the tower.
Mona: Okay, thank you, Arnold.
Arnold: It's "Ask-Me-For-Directions Arnold"!
Arnold: Do you have any other questions for me, fair maiden? Concerning, perhaps, my relationship status, or monthly income...?
Mona: No! Goodbye!
Mona: Let's ignore that raven and proceed! There's a secret passage in the cave ahead that leads directly to the top of the tower.
Arnold: Oh, oh, but Ma'am! Are you sure you're not interested in me? I only shared with you the secrets of the Immernachtreich because of your great beauty! Ma'am! Wait...!
