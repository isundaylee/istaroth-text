Traveler: I'm more interested in that machine than rumors...
Ding Jr.: A practical one, aren't you? No interest in rumors, all work, work, work... Gah, you're making me feel bad.
Ding Jr.: Anyway, this is the machine we use to bake the tea leaves. Some of the tea is placed in here after stirring to get rid of the moisture.
Ding Jr.: The flames under the machine might be powerful, but the temperature inside isn't too high, so the process takes a good while.
Ding Jr.: I don't need to watch the machine every second, so all in all, this job's not too tiring.
Ding Jr.: But Ol' Senior can't be distracted at all. I'm afraid I can't do his job yet...
