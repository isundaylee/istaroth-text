Traveler: You are still as cautious as ever.
Kozue: Komore Teahouse has the best view among all the high-end tea houses on this street. Many customers come here on its account.
Kozue: But of course, there are some guests who come here for our owner. They don't really drink tea, but they do want to see Taroumaru, which is troubling...
Kozue: They just barge in here without knowing the first thing about this place. Their bravery is indeed commendable, but I wouldn't make much of anything else about them.
Kozue: Only the guests who are approved by me may enter. As for the rest of the riffraff, I shall politely ask them to leave.
