# Missing title (1664053791)


## Talk 1

Paimon: This place seems to have its secrets after all...
Paimon: Shh! Listen. There are people talking over there.
Fatui Skirmisher: Gah. Never expected that woman's lips to be sealed up so tight. Not a peep from her at all!
Ronin: Anbu: Not to worry, sirs. Interrogation is our specialty. Take a break. We'll take care of this in a moment!
Fatui Skirmisher: We haven't much time left. The Teacher wants to know how much she knows about our plans, and he wants to know now â€” or we'll be in hot soup too!
Ronin: Anbu: Gah. His temper is really... something. What in the world did that woman do to anger him so?
Fatui Skirmisher: The Teacher's latest plans have this person named Lyudochka as a critical piece. But this Shuumatsuban woman took her out!
Fatui Skirmisher: Fortunately, the fire hadn't quite gone out when we rushed in. The Teacher, sharp-eyed as he is, identified Lyudochka from her clothes right away and recognized that our plans might be at risk.
Ronin: Anbu: Bad as that might have been, he really salvaged things, huh?
Fatui Skirmisher: Still, we don't know how much of our plans this woman is privy to, or if she's informed anyone else in the Shuumatsuban yet.
Paimon: It looks like Momoyo is locked up in an underground cell. Let's get her outta there!

## Talk 2

Fatui Skirmisher: Agh, I never thought that our operational plans would be leaked. That's some awful luck!
Fatui Skirmisher: Exactly! Also, I heard that the Teacher was summoned back to Snezhnaya, but that the Watatsumi Island operation is still going ahead.
Fatui Skirmisher: Don't you think the Teacher is acting a bit too independently? He didn't report this operation to Lady Arlecchino, did he?
Fatui Skirmisher: That's true. This is his own idea. You know what? I've got a bad feeling about this...
Fatui Skirmisher: Are you saying that if we fail, the Teacher's just going to pin all the blame on us?
