Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Hongyu: I was there at the Rite of Descension too. The Qixing had ordered us to maintain absolute secrecy regarding the matter at the time.
Hongyu: But now that the Rite of Parting is finished, everyone is aware of the situation. There's no need for us Millelith to keep silent about it any longer...
Hongyu: But even so... I'm sorry, I still can't bring myself to discuss this topic any further.
Hongyu: Rex Lapis... *sigh*
