Yip Tak: So you're still a big fan of Winter Melon Cake then?
Gaming: Eh? Oh, I guess you heard everything Paimon was saying, huh?
Yip Tak: Hehe... Of course. She was talking about you. As your father, how could I not listen?
Yip Tak: Remember back when you were a kid and you would sit on my shoulders to watch the Wushou dance? On our way back home, you would beg me to buy you some Winter Melon Cake.
Yip Tak: We would only buy two at a time, but before long, we'd tried the Winter Melon Cake from every vendor that street had to offer.
Yip Tak: There was also that one time you used your pocket money to treat me! Do you still remember?
Gaming: Yeah... I remember.
Yip Tak: That was the best Winter Melon Cake I ever had...
Gaming: Let's go back sometime. The shop's still there, and I remember the way. My treat, just like before.
Yip Tak: ...Are you sure?
Gaming: Absolutely!
