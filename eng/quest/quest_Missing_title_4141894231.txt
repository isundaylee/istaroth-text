Strange Merchant: Thank you so much, I am so grateful! Haiyaa, the entire cargo would've been lost without you!

Strange Merchant: This is farewell then. I hope we'll meet again!

## Talk 2

Strange Merchant: P—Please spare me, O magnanimous heroes... Wait, it's you guys!?
Traveler: It's you!?
Strange Merchant: Hey hey, what a coincidence, eh...? Ehehe, why don't you guys go back to what you're doing. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Strange Merchant: I suggest you see what valuables they left behind. Oh, don't mind me, I've already made notes of everything.... I'll return everything that needs to be returned.
Traveler: Wait...!
Strange Merchant: No need, after all, we'll definitely meet again!

Strange Merchant: #G—Great Chivalrous Hero! Please, spare my life! I'm not with them!
Traveler: And just who are you!?
Strange Merchant: Me!? I'm... Uh... It's a long story...? They stole some stuff, and I was asked by my master to register them and return them, that's all.
Strange Merchant: Well, since you drove away all the thieves, and my work here is done, I'll just skedaddle for now, if you don't mind!
Traveler: A moment...!
Strange Merchant: No need, after all, we'll definitely meet again!
