Traveler: About the Pilgrimage...
Karpa: The Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame is where contestants may win ultimate glory. All the people of Natlan are welcome to take part.
Karpa: Before, the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame would be held as needed in response to the Abyssal threat, but now, it's held purely as a contest.
Karpa: In the name of victory, may you all keep fighting until the very end.
Karpa: Just remember, you must never foment conflict for its own sake. All malicious acts will be laid bare under the Pyro Archon's vigilant gaze.
