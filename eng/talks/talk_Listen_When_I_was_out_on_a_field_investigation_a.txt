Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Listen! When I was out on a field investigation a few days ago, I saw a huge beast, it was beautiful, absolutely stunning!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Although there were several mountains between us, the moment I went to grab my Kamera, it jumped up and just disappeared... Could it have been one of those Adepti that I've heard about in the legends of Liyue!?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Adepti have always gathered at Chenyu Vale since ancient times, and meeting an Adeptus isn't a miracle that only happens once every thousand years."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "If this is true, your destiny seems to be entangled with the adepti. Why don't you ascend to Yilong Dais and offer a stick of our famous Crane Crown Incense to them to pray for your good fortune to last?"
