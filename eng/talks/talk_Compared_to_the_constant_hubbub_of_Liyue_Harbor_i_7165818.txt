Zhongli: Compared to the constant hubbub of Liyue Harbor, it is far more serene here.
Traveler: Yep, it's so quiet here.
Zhongli: It is a pleasant and leisurely atmosphere, not unfit for a festival.
Zhongli: On the way over, I saw grandparents preparing meals, children learning to make Xiao Lanterns... It was quite nostalgic for me. It took me back to the very earliest days of Liyue's history.
Zhongli: Back then, most able-bodied adults were busy supporting the war effort or helping to build the city. Like now, the oldest and youngest supported each other, living humble lives.
Traveler: It sounds like they had it rough...
Zhongli: Indeed, their lives were not easy. But the people of Liyue have tenacity and optimism in their bones.
Zhongli: They will never stop striving for progress, no matter how much destitution they face.
Zhongli: In ancient times, Qingce Village was once ravaged by the Chi. It is now several thousand years since it was put to rest.
Zhongli: Over the millennia, people built dwellings and worked the fertile land, creating the spectacular view we now see today.
Traveler: I heard a story about the Chi's corpse...
Zhongli: ...That after it died, its body became the rocky mountains and flowing waters of Qingce. I, too, have heard this story.
Zhongli: The idea is captivating. Though, I'm afraid, it is pure fantasy.
Zhongli: Lofty mountains have stood and spring water has flowed here since time immemorial. That people now inhabit this place is solely because they have toiled to make it so.
Zhongli: Qingce's verdant hills and stunning waters paired with the tranquil atmosphere here make it a place of extraordinary beauty. A rare blessing indeed.
Zhongli: Oh, one of the villagers generously gifted me with some fresh Bamboo Shoots. They will add some seasonal flavor to a meal on my return to Liyue Harbor.
Zhongli: Seasonal bamboo shoots are yet another rare blessing offered by Qingce Village.
