Traveler: Stock of what?
Mozhgan: Sumeru Rose, Mint, Nilotpala Lotus, and the like.
Mozhgan: Don't underestimate those small plants. You'll benefit greatly if you know how to use them.
Mozhgan: For example, your face will glow if you mash Sumeru Rose in water, and apply the mixture onto your face!
Mozhgan: So listen to me and always keep Sumeru roses in the house.
