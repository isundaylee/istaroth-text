# Missing title (3496307423)

Pain-Grocer: Arataki Gang, I'm here to duel!
Arataki Itto: Oh, what now? Has Grandmaster Hanakado sent another kid to challenge me?
Arataki Itto: Is he running out of people? 'Cause this is some serious bottom-of-the-barrel material.
Pain-Grocer: ...It's not you I'm after.
Pain-Grocer: Empty vessels make the most noise.
Pain-Grocer: #This {M#blond guy}{F#blonde gal}, on the other hand, looks like a strong and able warrior. I take it that {M#he}{F#she}'s the real leader of the Arataki Gang.
Paimon: #Hahaha! Now that's what Paimon calls a good judge of character! Go on, praise {M#him}{F#her} some more!
Arataki Itto: Hey, hey! What are you two talking about?
Arataki Itto: #My compadre here is strong, for sure, but {M#he}{F#she}'s just outside help. Make no mistake, there's only ever been one leader of the Arataki Gang, and that is yours truly, Arataki Itto!
Traveler: So should I be called the Oni King's Temporary Right Hand?
Paimon: Hey, nice idea! The Arataki Gang may not be the strongest gang in the world, but being a leader would still be pretty cool!
Paimon: If it's cool with you, Paimon could be called Arataki-for-3-Days-Only Paimon, or Paimon, Temporary Leader of the Arataki Gang!
Arataki Itto: Hey, hey, hey! Don't let your opponent lead you astray! She's clearly just... just trying to sow discord, yeah! Okay? All part of a nefarious plot to turn us against each other!
Arataki Itto: Just wait till I defeat her boss! She'll be begging to take back her words!
Pain-Grocer: Don't flatter yourself. I don't care about the Arataki Gang's internal affairs. I just want to battle strong opponents!
Pain-Grocer: Let's see just how good blondie here is at beetle fighting!
Traveler: Can't you just let me be the leader for a few days?
