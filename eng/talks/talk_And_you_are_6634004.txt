Traveler: And you are?
Oroluk: Good day. I'm Oroluk, and I'm one of the staff here at the Natlan Fishing Association.
Oroluk: If you want to buy special Natlan fishing gear and bait, just leave the legwork up to me!
Oroluk: If you find things a bit remote out here, you can always leave a message at Atlahua's Net. I'm the owner's friend, and I often go there to make purchases, too!
Oroluk: But as for fishing, I'm just your average angler. I'll keep on practicing and improving, though!
