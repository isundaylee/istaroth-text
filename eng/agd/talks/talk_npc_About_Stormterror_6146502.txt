Traveler: About Stormterror...
Charles: It's been quite the headache for sure. Stormterror's affected our tavern's supply routes, so the variety of wines here has also dropped...
Charles: As for Stormterror itself, I'm not too worried. I think those people who numb themselves with alcohol are just scared out of their wits.
Charles: But we do reach the point of no return, then we just need to wait for night to fall.
Charles: The "Knight Who Emerges At Night" will not just stand idly by.
