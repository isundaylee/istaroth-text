Traveler: You mean...
Mtwa: Yes, I speak of the unknown fragments that appeared in the sky during the battle against the Abyss.
Mtwa: At first, we thought they were Abyssal weapons, poised to descend upon us and bring destruction in their wake. But then, they just hung there doing nothing...
Mtwa: Later, someone said they resembled ancient relics from our western mountains. I went to see for myself, and they were indeed remarkably similar.
Mtwa: Oh dear, where are my manners? I haven't even told you who I am! I'm from the Natlan Saurian Relics Association and I'm out here doing fieldwork. Don't think for a second that this is a holiday!
