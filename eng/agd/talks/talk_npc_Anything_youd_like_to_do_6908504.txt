# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Freminet: Hmm... Could I trouble you to accompany me to a few places when you're free?
Freminet: I'd like to visit Lepaute Horlogerie, Beaumont Workshop, and the Vasari Passage.
Traveler: Sure thing.
Freminet: Mhm... I'd like to take a look at their clockwork crafts, as well as the variety of small mechanisms they usually have to offer.
Freminet: I'm a regular of Leschots', but whenever I pass by the other shops, I can't help but be curious...
Freminet: What lies hidden deep within those shops? What if there's something there that's both original and exquisitely designed?
Freminet: What I wouldn't give to be able to see everything for myself! If only... *sigh*
Freminet: See, I'm... not very good at dealing with people, and if I spent a lot of time gawking at the wares without paying a single coin, I'm sure the shopkeepers would get mad at me.
Freminet: So, if you could step in at that point, and help me...
Traveler: Explain on your behalf?
Freminet: Yeah... Something like that. I know it might be awkward, but...
Freminet: I'll pay you back, I swear! As long as it's something I can do...
Traveler: No problem.
Freminet: Ahh, thank you so much! I'm... not dreaming, am I?
Traveler: Pay for the wares?
Freminet: Eh!? No, no, of course not! That's not what I meant at all...
Freminet: Just a few words of explanation... should be enough.
Traveler: Is there anything in particular you're interested in?
