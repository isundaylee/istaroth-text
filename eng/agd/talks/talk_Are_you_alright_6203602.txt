Traveler: Are you alright?
Guanhai: Me? Oh nothing, other than the fact that I work on a ship. That ship that's just set sail to be precise...
Guanhai: Getting up so early in the morning is my biggest hurdle. I never seem to get enough sleep.
Guanhai: I mean when there's so much to go out and do at night, how can anyone expect me to sleep!? Haha, no way. That whole "early to bed, early to rise" lifestyle... I'd rather be dead.
Guanhai: Ahh... Seems the captain has forgotten about me for today. Guess I'll have to try harder to be up earlier tomorrow.
