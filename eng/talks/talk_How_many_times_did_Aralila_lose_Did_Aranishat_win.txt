Aranishat: How many times did Aralila lose? Did Aranishat win?
Aralila: So many matches. Who won? Who lost? Aralila doesn't know!
Aranishat: Huh? Forget it! Happy Festival Utsava, more important than winning.
Aralila: Aranishat... really has a point.
Aranishat: Aranishat and Aralila both won, twice. All Aranara, and friends of Aranara, all won, for many times!
