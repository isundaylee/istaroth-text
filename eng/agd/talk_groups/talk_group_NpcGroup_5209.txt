Traveler: You invented Fonta?
Heinry: Huh? You honestly don't know who I am? Hahaha, okay, then allow me to introduce myself.
Heinry: My name is Heinry, and I am a researcher at the Fontaine Research Institute, and one of the developers of Fonta. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Heinry: However, though I say I am a "Fontaine Research Institute researcher," I have not participated in any research for some time, and have been focused on the Fonta business itself, outside of the Institute.
Heinry: This time, I am coming as an interim representative of Fonta Co., and wish to discuss the rebuilding of the Institute.
Heinry: But Mr. Choiseul seemed somewhat reluctant when we started talking about funding. I don't know what he's worried about...
