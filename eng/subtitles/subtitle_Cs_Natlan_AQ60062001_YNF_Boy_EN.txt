...Maybe no single nation is her home
...Where exactly is "home" to you?
...Searching your memories?
The curse is still active
This will only hasten your demise
...We're all from Nod-Krai
...Cross the ocean
Find a new place to belong
What an amazing machine...
Where are you from?
Such a hard worker!
Fancy making this your new home?
...It's the Wild Hunt!
Look out!
Impossible...
Where is this data from?
...From now on, your name's "Ineffa"!
Promise me...
Remember
You have to come home!
Re...
Return...
Data... overload...
Capacity... exceeded...
As long as this gem's around
The "heart" that Ixquieh built you
Should keep beating away
It may take centuries, even millennia
But one day, may your new memories transcend your pain and rage...
To conquer the curse that shackles you
What kind of gem is it?
Nothing special, really
To quote my mother... it's nothing but an empty shell now
But if you break free of the curse
Then maybe...
Hmm...?
Hehe, nothing
An interesting idea suddenly occurred to me...
Hmm... Let's make this the final secret key
The final secret key... is...
Impossible...
