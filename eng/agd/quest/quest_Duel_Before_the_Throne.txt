# Duel Before the Throne

Signora: The way people charge in here as they please... So uncivilized.
Signora: If I didn't know this was Tenshukaku, I might have mistaken it for some kind of street market.
Signora: Have you learned your lesson now?
Paimon: Oh no, what has she done to Kujou Sara...
Raiden Shogun: The right to punish Inazumans for their crimes is mine alone. Not yours, Signora.
Signora: ...Then I apologize, Almighty Shogun.
Traveler: Signora!
Signora: I know, I know, you can't get me out of your mind. But you really don't need to call my name all the time.
Signora: Don't go thinking I'm surprised to see you here. I'm well aware that you hate me, with the way you follow me around like a dark shadow.
Traveler: You're secretly distributing Delusions...
Signora: Ah, so you came to expose my crimes in front of the Shogun?
Signora: Hehehe... I'm just a Snezhnayan diplomat. I'm afraid I have no idea what you're talking about.
Paimon: She doesn't take us seriously at all...
Traveler: For all who have lost their Visions...
Signora: Stop talking about people and things that I care nothing about.
Signora: They were nobodies to begin with, and their names will be forgotten. But now, at least, they get to be building blocks in the grand revolution to realize eternity...
Signora: Is that not the greatest honor they could hope for in their tiny little lives?
Signora: Almighty Shogun... do correct me if I'm wrong?
Raiden Shogun: ...
Traveler: For Venti's Gnosis...
Signora: That's ancient history. You certainly love to hold a grudge.
Signora: The Tsaritsa's dream is the noblest and purest thing in all the world.
Signora: These other mundane details you insist on mentioning... They're just necessary sacrifices. That's all.
Traveler: It's time for me to put a stop to this.
Signora: You? Stop me? Hahaha...
Signora: For what it's worth, I've grown tired of seeing you around as well. But I didn't have you down as someone quite so foolhardy.
Signora: Before you go saying something you can't take back, remember that you're Inazuma's most wanted criminal... I suggest you consider your circumstances very carefully.
Signora: Charging into Tenshukaku uninvited and lecturing me in front of the Shogun wasn't the brightest move. Don't you think it's time you stopped digging?
Signora: I'm not sure you realize quite how much distance there is between us, both in status... and in strength.
Traveler: I challenge you...
Traveler: ...To a duel before the throne!
Signora: ...
Raiden Shogun: Proceed.
Signora: My, you're full of surprises today... So you've learned to make the law of the land work for you too, hmm?
Signora: I'll admit that I never expected to be in a situation where the two of us were on equal footing.
Signora: You are aware... that the loser must die? Are you sure this is what you want?
Paimon: #Traveler...
Signora: Hehehe... then I will deign to share this last dance with you... till death do us part.
Traveler: And for the people of Liyue you imperiled...
Traveler: For all who have been harmed by Delusions...
Traveler: You're trying to seize control of Inazuma...

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Kujou Takayuki: As long as we have the Musou no Hitotachi, the people of Inazuma have nothing to fear. A self-evident fact, yet Sara is blind to it... Hmph.
