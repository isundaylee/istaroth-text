# Chasmic Maze


## Talk 1

Arataki Itto: That's it, I wanna take another look. And this time, I, Arataki "The One and Oni," will...
Kuki Shinobu: Boss.
Arataki Itto: Whoa! What's up, sourpuss?
Kuki Shinobu: Time for some Roasted Lavender Melon.
Arataki Itto: Huh? We're trapped in a life and death situation underground, and you're telling me it's time for Roasted Lavender Melon?
Ushi: Moo, moo.
Arataki Itto: Interesting, you hear that? Ushi says you're completely right... Wait, hold on, whose side are you on, Beefcake?
Ushi: Moo...
Kuki Shinobu: It's important to stay replenished. We must keep our energy and morale up in preparation for facing the unknown.
Kuki Shinobu: Even Ushi knows that.
Arataki Itto: Fine, you two... Hey are you already eating?
Arataki Itto: Hold on, is it still warm? Oh, that does smell good... Mmm...
Arataki Itto: Fine, yeah, we'll have a quick snack and then we'll keep looking for a way out. Hey, don't eat them all, leave a couple for me!

## Talk 2

Arataki Itto: Wh— Huh? Wait, this ain't right!
Paimon: Uh, how did we end up back here!?
Arataki Itto: So we've been here already?
Kuki Shinobu: Yes, this is exactly where we started.
Arataki Itto: But we couldn't have taken a wrong turn, we were headed in the same direction the entire time. We never turned around...
Yelan: Yes, that's what I thought, too.
Arataki Itto: Traveler, we were going the right way, weren't we?
Traveler: Yes, I thought we were headed in the right direction.
Paimon: How strange...
Arataki Itto: There's a legend in Inazuma about a merchant who was tricked by a bake-danuki one evening and kept circling around the same place the whole night. Even by dawn, they still hadn't found a way out...
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon's heard that one before too.
Arataki Itto: So we're all familiar with the story then? Good, because I'm pretty sure that's what's happening to us right now.
Arataki Itto: But fear not, I happen to have a certain sidekick who can exorcise youkai and spirits and whatnot. Let me summon him real quick.
Paimon: Unbelievable. An oni who's friends with an exorcist... What an open-minded guy.
Kuki Shinobu: For the boss, ignorance is a virtue.
Arataki Itto: You're up, Ushi, go get that spirit!
Ushi: Moo!
Arataki Itto: This is Ushi, an auxiliary member of the Arataki Gang.
Ushi: Moo, moo.
Arataki Itto: Haha, oh, Ushi says hello everyone. You can just call him "Ushi" or "Beefcake." Yeah, he's got a keen sense of direction, so I'll let him lead the way.
Yelan: I didn't know gangs could have auxiliary members...
Yanfei: This does not have the trappings of something that's gonna work.
Yelan: You're telling me.
Arataki Itto: Alright, go Ushi! Go find us a way outta here!
Ushi: Moo!
Black Screen Text: Ushi begins looking around for a hidden exit...
Ushi: Moo... Moo, moo... Moo!
Arataki Itto: Huh? What's that... Really!? Aw, no way!
Paimon: What's wrong?
Arataki Itto: Ushi says he's searched everywhere but there's no exit.
Arataki Itto: That doesn't add up, if we were able to come in, then there must be a way to get out. Here, lemme take another look.
Yanfei: Has anyone else noticed this? We initially thought we fell here from above. At that time, there was a way out high overhead... But now, it seems even that exit has disappeared.
Yanfei: Inexplicable, if you ask me...
Kuki Shinobu: It seems there's more than meets the eye with these underground structures.
Yelan: ...I'm gonna take another look around.
Paimon: Everywhere we look there are just more and more rocks. Uh, maybe we've just misremembered, maybe this isn't the place we started from!
Arataki Itto: What, you scared now?
Paimon: N—No, Paimon's super brave...!
Ushi: Moo...
Arataki Itto: Oh yeah? Well Ushi also thinks you're scared. It's okay, don't be scared to admit you're uh... scared. You've got us here to protect you.
Traveler: I'm here for you too, Paimon.
Arataki Itto: #We can't just sit here twiddling our thumbs, let's keep looking for a way out. Shinobu, you stay here with my precious savior, I'll take Traveler and Paimon with me.
Kuki Shinobu: Got it. Be careful, everyone.
Yanfei: Please, there's no need to keep calling me "savior," just Yanfei is fine. Mr. Arataki, it seems that as the head of the Arataki Gang, you possess a strong sense of leadership.
Arataki Itto: Too kind, too kind. And just call me Itto. Since we're a team now, we should have each other's backs. Paimon, if you feel scared again, I can cover your eyes for you.
Black Screen Text: You split into teams to investigate the surroundings, but fail to find anything...
Arataki Itto: ...*sigh*
Paimon: Seems there's really no way out...
Ushi: Moo!
Arataki Itto: I can't shake the feeling that there's something off about this place.
Kuki Shinobu: Boss, did you guys find anything over there?
Traveler: No, nothing.
Arataki Itto: Not only that, I coulda sworn I saw some shadows moving a second ago... This place better not be haunted.
Paimon: Probably not the right time to ask this, but Paimon just can't help it. Itto, you're an oni... Doesn't that kinda mean everywhere you go is haunted?
Arataki Itto: No! ...Ignore the red horns, okay? I'm talking about spooky, floaty ghosts, now-you-see-'em, now-you-don't kinda haunted.
Paimon: Uh, Itto? Are you... afraid of ghosts?
Kuki Shinobu: Oh no, Boss. You've been found out.
Arataki Itto: What, me? Hah, no way! You kidding? Stop joking around... seriously though.
Paimon: Hehe, looking at you, Paimon suddenly doesn't feel scared anymore... Hey, Bull-Chucker, if you're scared, Paimon can cover your eyes for you.
Kuki Shinobu: ...
Kuki Shinobu: Maybe I should make better use of my time.
Traveler: (Hmm? Shinobu walked off to grab a few stones, then she took out some twigs and Lavender Melons from her pocket... What?)
Kuki Shinobu: Add a little salt... and some pepper.
Traveler: Are you roasting Lavender Melons?
Kuki Shinobu: Yeah. Roasted Lavender Melon is delicious. You can try some when it's done.
Traveler: Okay.
Kuki Shinobu: Oh right, there are two types: sweet and savory. Which would you prefer?
Traveler: I'm happy with either.
Kuki Shinobu: Alright, you can try them both then. It's important that we remain calm, especially when we are in the throes of a tough situation like this.
Kuki Shinobu: If I'm reading the situation correctly, there seems to be some secret here that the boss and I are not supposed to know about. But don't worry, I'll distract the boss while you discuss things with the others.
Yanfei: Ooh, I thought I smelled something cooking.
Kuki Shinobu: Would you like some, Yanfei?
Yanfei: Thank you, but I'm not hungry. You guys go ahead.
Yanfei: Oh, and by the way, I haven't seen you in a while, Shinobu.
Kuki Shinobu: Yeah, it has been a while, hasn't it? The last time I saw you was when you taught one of my classes as a substitute while I was studying in Liyue.
Yanfei: Substitute teacher... Ah yes, now I remember. It was during winter, wasn't it?
Kuki Shinobu: Yes, I remember everyone said your lecture was very interesting. Now that I think about it, I should call you "Senpai."
Yanfei: Ooh, I like the sound of that! Hehe!
Yanfei: Who would've ever guessed that we'd get caught up in such a dilemma together. It must be fate.
Traveler: So Yanfei gives lectures too? That's incredible.
Kuki Shinobu: Not only that, she's funny and engaging while she speaks. Needless to say, she is very popular among the students.
Yanfei: Haha! Aww, I'm flattered.
Yelan: I see everyone is still here.
Yanfei: Yelan, we split into groups and searched the area, but there are no signs of any way out. How about you? Did you manage to find anything?
Yelan: No.
Yelan: And... though I'd prefer not to say it, we'd better mentally prepare ourselves.
Yelan: If we can't find a way out, we may be stuck underground for some time.
Yanfei: ...I think you might be right.
Kuki Shinobu: ...I understand.
Yelan: Hmm, an underground space with an entrance but no exit... it just doesn't make any sense. I'll figure something out, just give me some time.
Yelan: If anyone happens to find a potential exit, please be sure to take every precaution before exploring further.
Traveler: (Come to think of it, Xiao is here, too. He said we can always call his name if we get into trouble.)
Traveler: (Maybe it's worth a try...)
Paimon: Hey, Traveler? What's with the serious face? Do you have a plan?
Traveler: Well, I was just thinking that Xiao is also here, remember?
Paimon: Xiao... oh, right! Do you want to get him to help us?
Traveler: I think it's worth a try.
Paimon: Sure, let's give it a shot!
Traveler: ...
Traveler: Xiao, can you hear me?
Paimon: ...
Traveler: ...
Traveler: Uh, Xiao?
Paimon: Huh, no response... Paimon thought Xiao would come no matter where we are.
Paimon: Oh no, does that mean even Xiao can't sense our presence here?
Traveler: (...)
Traveler: (Wonder what that could mean... What's the deal with this place?)

## Talk 3

Yanfei: Who could've ever guessed we'd get trapped in a place like this. It's quite the predicament...
Yanfei: For all the studying I've done in my life, all I know is how to land people in prison... I don't know the first thing about breaking out of one...
Yanfei: I've even made a contract with my father to "live a happy life"... I can't give up hope now.
Yanfei: Try and stay positive... At least I've explored a new place and seen more of the world while reuniting with some old friends.
Yanfei: Uh-huh... Yeah, there's still a silver lining. I guess...

## Talk 4

Yelan: Our situation is grim. There doesn't appear to be a way out for now. We should be prepared to stay for a while.
Yelan: Fortunately, we don't seem to lack supplies, and even our motley crew has people who can keep their cool when the stakes are high.
Yelan: Just focus on taking care of yourselves, I'll figure out the rest.
