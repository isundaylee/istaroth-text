# Missing title (3602327703)

Traveler: Big dream...
Darina: I haven't been able to dream ever since I grew up, but still, one should dream big.
Darina: Good luck will follow only if you dream big!
Darina: Maybe one day, King Deshret or Greater Lord Rukkhadevata will come back again...
Darina: Either will do. Upon their return, there will be no desert, no pain, no Samiel-Control Engineers, no Bimarstan's doctors.
Darina: Hehehe, just saying this cracks me up.
