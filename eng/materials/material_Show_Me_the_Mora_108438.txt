# Show Me the Mora

Dori's specialty. After paying a large sum of Mora, you finally got a chance to taste the dish cooked by Lord Sangemah Bay herself. Firm chicken is covered in the silky sauce with a smooth texture. With the mind-controlling charm of its great flavor, this dish is spurring an impulse in you to spend another fortune just to get another bite!
