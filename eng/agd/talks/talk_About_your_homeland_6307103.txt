Traveler: About your homeland...
Li Xiao: I grew up in Liyue Harbor. I left my home because I wanted to see the other cities. I joined a caravan and started doing business everywhere.
Li Xiao: It has been almost a decade since I left. Although I did make some progress in my career, I also feel more and more guilty... To everyone else, I must be a really unfilial son.
Li Xiao: I wanted to go home after this trip, but that got canned by the lockdown in Inazuma...
Li Xiao: Even more surprisingly, my mischievous little sister snuck out of doors and boarded the same boat bound for Inazuma.
Li Xiao: Ah, if I don't take good care of her, how can I face my parents?
