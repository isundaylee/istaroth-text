# Fungi Are Not Tidalga!

Black Screen Text: After a while, you and Paimon arrive at the Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta booth...
Enghiene: Mmm! I love these soft, bouncy, smooth, squishy Fungi! Hehe, I want to keep playing!
Traveler: And you are...
Enghiene: I'm Enghiene, and I was Turenna's drillmaster before she entered the Special Patrol!
Enghiene: I'm nothing like her, you hear? Nothing! I'm not going to grovel before you just because you're Super Zenith Boss-Level Forces!
Paimon: Uh, so this super arrogant Melusine... used to be Turenna's drillmaster?
Haniyyah: Don't worry, Golden Comet, Silver Companion!
Haniyyah: Ms. Turenna received new orders not long ago, and has returned to the Special Patrol's base.
Haniyyah: Before departing, she asked Ms. Enghiene to watch the event area in her place.
Haniyyah: She loves Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta, and we're always playing it.
Enghiene: That's right! I love both the tabletop game, and those round Fungi in real life!
Enghiene: They're soft, bouncy, smooth, and squishy... just like Tidalga... Hehehe...
Traveler: Why are you drooling?
Enghiene: I won't! I just want to hold them and rub my face against them. Haniyyah didn't mind when I pinched Kindlejoy!
Paimon: That's... That's the most you can do! Only we can hold Bongo-Head!
Enghiene: You're so stingy! I want them both!
Enghiene: Haniyyah said you're experts at the game. How about a round against me?
Enghiene: If I win, I'm going to hold and pinch Bongo-Head!
Paimon: Grr, she's looking down on us!
Paimon: #Let's do this, {NICKNAME}! As early adopters of the game, we need to show her what we're made of!
Traveler: We're also the first champions of the Nilotpala Cup!
Paimon: We didn't earn these titles just to be this easily defeated!
Traveler: And the Twin Stars of Brilliant Valor!
Traveler: You can't eat them! No eating Fungi!
