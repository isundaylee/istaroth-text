# The Gourmet Supremos: On the Road


## Talk 1

???: What can I do for you?
Traveler: Excuse me, you are...
???: I'm Kamei Munehisa, I am just passing by.
Julie: Wow... This guy dresses like a samurai...
Parvaneh: S...samurai? Is he the samurai from the Shogunate... I heard that the Shogunate's attitude towards outlanders is quite... subtle...
???: ...
???: Don't worry. I've left the Shogunate. I'm no longer a samurai.
???: I often come here to look for food. But today, I noticed monsters wandering around.
???: They've taken all the food around here. So I had to destroy them.
Traveler: How often do you come here?
???: There are not many monsters around here usually. I often come here to pick fruits or hunt.
???: Well, that's all I have to say. After killing these monsters, the other ones around here won't dare to come here for a while.
???: If you are also looking for food, you can look around. I only took what I need. There should be something left.
???: Well, goodbye.
Julie: Did he just leave just like that? His behavior is exactly like the samurai I heard about before...
Parvaneh: But what does he mean he's left the Shogunate? Samurai who have left the Shogunate are...
Traveler: They are like the enemies we met before.
Parvaneh: Yes, I also heard that some samurai who have left the Shogunate wander around and rob people in the streets for a living...
Parvaneh: Although he doesn't look like a bad guy, we'd better stay vigilant.
Xudong: All right, all right. Aren't we here to look for ingredients? But judging from the current situation, we'd better not go any further, in case it gets dangerous.
Xudong: This traveler has been escorting us for such a long time. Let's cook something here, have a short break and then we'll head back to town.
Xudong: The guy said there are still ingredients left behind, right? Let's look around.
Traveler: Like the Kairagi.
Traveler: Did you kill all these monsters?
???: Yes, they are just ordinary monsters. They're easy to deal with.
Traveler: Why are you looking for food in the wild?
???: ...
???: I have my own reasons.

## Talk 2

Xudong: I was going to look for some fresh ingredients... Anyway, these will do.
Xudong: I'm sorry. I wanted to cook something nice for you, but now I guess we'll have to make do with these.
Traveler: It's fine.
Xudong: You worked hard escorting us. "It's fine" is not an acceptable answer.
Xudong: I'll remember this and treat you to a nice meal next time.
Xudong: Julie, is the soup ready? Remember not to let Parvaneh...
Julie: No, no, just let the soup simmer quietly!
Parvaneh: It's fine. I'm seasoning this soup according to my improved recipe. I'm just adding a little bit of seasoning...
Julie: I don't understand your improved recipe. Stop it! Xudong, Xudong, come over here!
Xudong: Parvaneh! Hey! What kind of strange seasoning are you putting in!?
Parvaneh: Strange seasoning? This is my special sauce! This is the result of my thesis research!
Xudong: I don't need that! Let's just eat something ordinary today! Julie, stop her!
Parvaneh: Humph, what do you know... Fine, let me fine-tune this. I am going to make the ultimate seasoning that will make any dish delicious.
Xudong: Ultimate seasoning... Is something like that really possible?
Parvaneh: No one has ever done it, that's why I am going to! I'll show those stuck-up unbelievers at the Akademiya!
Xudong: Haha... Well, I look forward to it.
Xudong: By the way, traveler, thank you for spending all this time running around with us. Thank you.
Xudong: I'll prepare a takeaway for you. You've got to have enough food when you are adventuring out there.
Xudong: Next time we meet, I will treat you to a nice meal.
Traveler: I'll find you to cook me a feast next time.
Xudong: Hahaha, okay. I'll make a note of this. I'll make sure to treat you to something nice next time...
