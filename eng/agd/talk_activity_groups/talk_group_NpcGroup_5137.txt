Lectoure: Hehe. I sure hope she likes the present that I picked out ever so carefully...

## Talk

Traveler: A present?
Lectoure: That's right â€” I've chosen something special from Fontaine to give to my lady love.
Lectoure: Curious, I'd hope? All the other sailors hurried off to the Court of Fontaine the moment we came ashore. Only I came back here.
Lectoure: Sailing is hard work, yeah, but I truly look forward to setting sail once more to see my lady love in Natlan.
Lectoure: When it comes to passions, I am nothing if not a serious man. If all goes well, I would even be willing to change lines of work and stay with her.
Lectoure: But there are quite a few tribes where she lives, and different tribes come with different rules... Will I be able to integrate smoothly?

Traveler: See you.
Lectoure: I hope you have a great day yourself, just like I am!

Lectoure: Thank you for cooperating with me! This deck isn't bad at all! I guess I'll give it away to this girl I like...

## Talk

Lectoure: This deck seems slightly wanting as a gift. I'll have to figure out how to improve the card combination...
