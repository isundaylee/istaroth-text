# Finale


## Talk 1

Charlotte: Alright. Last stop, the docks!

## Talk 2

Paimon: The entrance to the Fortress... Ooh, he really is there!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Wow, guess we're here again, huh? There's a real nostalgic feeling to this place.
Wriothesley: Looks like you've been missing us.
Paimon: Duke! Did you come all the way to the entrance to greet us?
Wriothesley: Of course. I'm here to welcome you and our dear Miss Charlotte, whom our good Head Nurse recommended to me.
Charlotte: It's an honor to finally meet the much rumored Duke. Thank you for consenting to my visit to the Fortress, sir.
Wriothesley: No need to thank me — but that said, I shouldn't be the focus of your interview. I trust you recall our agreement?
Charlotte: Of course, of course!
Wriothesley: Alright then, this way.
Jurieu: ...
Lourvine: ...
Charlotte: Hmm? Hey, no need to be so nervous. I've already taken all the photos we need.
Lourvine: Um... Miss Charlotte... Do these pictures really need to be published on the cover of The Steambird?
Wriothesley: It would seem that Miss Lourvine doesn't want her face to appear beside that of Mr. Jurieu, hmm?
Jurieu: Sir, please don't say things like that!
Wriothesley: Ah, but it looks like dear Mr. Jurieu denies it. Might this interview be very important to you, then?
Jurieu: No! I—I just... This is my first time being interviewed, and I'm very thankful to The Steambird for...
Charlotte: Haha, now, I might not look it, but I did actually meet Mr. Edwin once, and I'll be honest, I enjoyed chatting with you more — you've definitely got more of that "genius" vibe going on!
Charlotte: The boat that brought about a miracle, the ark that saved the people! Why, you recreated a myth back there, like an emissary of legend!
Charlotte: ...Still, if I might ask, where's that flying ship now?
Paimon: Heh, looks like Charlotte's trying to get herself another exclusive scoop...
Wriothesley: I have to apologize, but that ship is presently in the bowels of our factory. I'm afraid it won't be easy for you to get a shot of it.
Charlotte: Really? Then in that case, could I have an interview with you to make up for that loss?
Traveler: (She really does know how to squeeze opportunities for all they're worth...)
Wriothesley: You already know my answer, I'm afraid. Best you interview our Head Nurse instead — or perhaps you'd like to take another photo of this couple of researchers?
Lourvine: Did you really have to use the word "couple"!?
Charlotte: Well, then, two solo photos will do!
Jurieu: Is my hair messed up? Please, someone help me have a look...
Paimon: Things sure are getting pretty lively here... Uh, we've seen this kind of thing before...
Sigewinne: Ooh, seems like everyone's here! Would any of you like to try this new drink I came up with...
Wriothesley: Ah, Sigewinne...
Lourvine: Ah, uh — Hey, Miss Charlotte! Why don't you, ah, take some pretty photos of our Head Nurse?
Charlotte: Hmm? Uh, sure! C'mon, Miss Sigewinne, over this way. Let's find a brighter spot...
Sigewinne: Huh? Oh, sure... Do I have to smile?
Paimon: So, how've things been at the Fortress?
Wriothesley: Same old same old, as you can see. Fontaine's undergone some changes, but this place's still more or less the same.
Jurieu: Other than that flying ship. It got a tad too much attention, I think...
Wriothesley: That's why I decided to let the interview go through. We should direct more public opinions toward the behind-the-scenes heroes — am I right, Mr. Jurieu? Miss Lourvine?
Lourvine: You're too kind, sir. I believe that you, too, should have your day in the sun — not that you would want that, which is a pity.
Wriothesley: Hahaha, I'll just leave the spotlight to you two.
Black Screen Text: You walk with Wriothesley for a while and share news from above ground with him...
Wriothesley: I see. Lots of things happened that day, huh? Anyway, regarding that Harbinger, I'm not sure you remember, but his three young followers are still waiting for his return.
Paimon: He sure did win them over, huh...
Wriothesley: I'll tell them that there's good news and bad news — the good being that their boss seems fine, and the bad being that they must face extended sentences for abetting his escape.
Paimon: Oh, actually, what about you? Are things gonna change for you, too?
Wriothesley: What change can there be? The Fortress will keep chugging along, and so will my duties.
Wriothesley: As to what Miss Furina's departure will mean for the nation, and if our laws and governance will be transformed... We'll leave those to the folks in the overworld.
Charlotte: Hey, everyone. The photoshoot's done!
Wriothesley: Good. In that case, let's call it a day here.
Charlotte: #Thanks for your cooperation. C'mon, Traveler, let's go. Till next time, everyone!
Wriothesley: There'll be a next time?
Charlotte: Maybe! Who knows? I might write a story about the underwater factory next time. Until then!

## Talk 4

Clorinde: You seem curious about the Fortress.
Navia: Of course! Ugh, that Wriothesley... I still remember going down to the Fortress to grill him for information on my father's case. Boy, did he take me for a ride... without telling me anything, of course.
Clorinde: But he did invite you to tea, didn't he?
Navia: Two large pots of it, in fact — it was good tea, though.
Clorinde: I have to agree. The tea there is very good.
Navia: Ah, speaking of that, would you like to have some today? I mean, you've got time, right?
Clorinde: I'd be partial to some shortbread.
Navia: ...Wow, it's like we've got a menu, or something... Sure, sure.
Clorinde: Good.
Navia: What flavor of biscuits would you like, Mr. Snezhevich?
Gerunt Snezhevich: Me? I'm fine with anything... but I would prefer chocolate, should you have it.
Navia: Alright. Leave it to me!
Clorinde: I'll go over the newly-arrived supplies with you later, Mr. Snezhevich. We should be able to finish the preparatory work today.
Gerunt Snezhevich: That works great for me.
Navia: Huh. Is it just me, or did you get a new lipstick?
Clorinde: I did. It was a gift from Sigewinne. Want to give it a try? I think the color would suit you, too.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Paimon sees them! They really are here. How did you know?
Charlotte: Navia mentioned that she stayed in touch with Lyney and the others after working together. Apparently, they've been at the docks distributing these strange pockets the whole time since.
Lyney: #Traveler, Paimon — ah, and Miss Charlotte, too.
Lynette: Would you like a Magic Pocket?
Charlotte: What sort of gadget is it?
Lynette: It's a wondrous bag that can be used to carry many things. The water level has returned to normal, but if you see any of your things floating around, you can use this to carry them — or you could trick a friend into doing it for you.
Charlotte: Trick a friend? Huh, I wonder which of my friends would fall for that...?
Lynette: You could just make a friend like Freminet here. Isn't that right, Freminet?
Freminet: Is this what you meant by "I'll help you make some more friends"...
Charlotte: To be honest, that sounds pretty sweet! Could I have your contact, please?
Freminet: Uhh... Oh, um... sure. Please, write down my address.
Paimon: Lynette sure is working hard to help Freminet socialize...
Lynette: He was the one who proposed doing this — he even wants to assist in our magic shows.
Traveler: Sounds like that would suit him.
Lyney: Yes, I was planning to first introduce Pers as an assistant, and later Freminet himself. In the future, I think we can leave underwater escape magic to him, too.
Lynette: That said, would anyone want to see a diver escape underwater?
Lyney: Oh, it'll work out. Every journey begins with a first step — he'll become a part of our show eventually.
Freminet: Lynette, could you come over? Miss Charlotte says she wants to take a picture of us...
Lynette: Got it.
Lyney: #My, that Charlotte is rather perceptive. She got rid of everyone the moment she realized I had something to say to you... So. How've things been, Traveler?
Traveler: I'm doing alright.
Lyney: "Father" says that you did a great deal during the latest events. She's very grateful for your contributions to Fontaine.
Paimon: Aw, that's alright. We were more than happy to help... So, what's she doing now?
Lyney: Oh, I guess you haven't heard. Well...
Lyney: After Lady Furina left, "Father" and Monsieur Neuvillette opened negotiations, during which he gave Fontaine's Gnosis to her as a "diplomatic gift."
Paimon: A "diplomatic gift"? A Gnosis?
Lyney: Yes. I was quite surprised at first, myself. But when I thought it over, there were actually a number of things going for it...
Lyney: It could have been done as an apology for the incident with Lord Childe, or as thanks for his help in tying the All-Devouring Narwhal down...
Lyney: Furthermore, "Father" did also lend significant aid to Fontaine and Poisson.
Paimon: Well, that's true, but this is a Gnosis we're talking about. Doesn't this seem a bit... irresponsible?
Lyney: I would agree, but I've also heard that... It seems that Monsieur Neuvillette has had a significant change of heart regarding the matter.
Paimon: Huh? So there's some reason for this that only Neuvillette knows about?
Lyney: I suspect you'll have to ask him about that yourself. Ah, yes, speaking of which, I did see him strolling around the entrance to the Fortress of Meropide a while back.
Paimon: Huh. Isn't he real busy and stuff? Paimon didn't think he'd have the time for that.
Paimon: But back to the topic, the Gnosis was given to The Knave, right? What about Childe?
Lyney: They say that he's returned to Snezhnaya to recover from his wounds. I hear that the recent disaster really did a number on his health.
Traveler: Well, I guess I can now call him one of my "war buddies."
Paimon: That's true. When you think about it, we've had loads of run-ins with the Fatui. To think we'd be allied with them this time...
The Knave (???): So shocked by such a simple switching of sides?
Paimon: Waah! Who—!?
Lyney: "Father"!
The Knave: Well, well, what do you know? Come to the docks to see how my children are doing, and meet the Traveler by chance. Please do not pay my accomplishments in Fontaine too much mind. I would have done them regardless.
Paimon: Are you going to... take the Gnosis back to Snezhnaya?
The Knave: That is our duty as Harbingers, yes.
The Knave: Don't be too preoccupied with "sides." The goal of the Fatui concerns not a single place or person, but the entire world. With such a grand goal in mind, it is inevitable that we must wear many masks.
The Knave: Switching my masks is something I've always done.
Traveler: Will you keep to your position?
The Knave: That depends on many things, no one truly knows what the future holds. What good is honesty if you can't rely on it forever?
The Knave: As for you, I very much look forward to our next collaboration. Good things cannot be achieved alone, and you've proved yourselves to be great partners.
Traveler: Actually, I just remembered something... Please help us deliver this.
The Knave: A Vision? ... Ha, alright. I'll remember to return it. Thank you for keeping it safe for him this entire time.
Charlotte: And that's a wrap for me! ...Huh!? You... You're...
The Knave: Greetings, Miss Journalist.
Charlotte: Ah, um... Hello. If I'm not mistaken, there are diplomatic channels I'll need to report to to take a photo of you...
The Knave: That is correct, so forgive me, but I will not be able to serve as a subject in your article. However, feel free to write as much as you'd like about our dear magicians — and our upcoming rookie talent.
Charlotte: I—I will!
The Knave: The sea breeze is quite pleasant. I shall continue my walk while the weather remains so agreeable. Farewell.
Lyney: Farewell, "Father."
Charlotte: ...She has such an intimidating presence... I didn't even dare to take a picture... Thankfully, I've already wrapped up all of my prescheduled interviews. Thank you all — this'll be more than enough for me to write about, I'm sure.
Lyney: #Don't be too nervous. Why don't you take a Magic Pocket before you go? Here, Traveler, Paimon, you take one too.
Paimon: To move things about?
Lyney: That's right. Funny — I was giving out Magic Pockets when we first met, too, and what do you know? I'm doing the exact same thing right now. So many things have happened, but the Pockets are still the Pockets.
Lyney: I guess this must be "life." We will all follow our own paths, and serendipity will lead you to your fated friends.
Lyney: Alright then. We'll be handing out pockets in some other districts later, so we'll get going now. Have a good day, you two!

## Talk 6

Neuvillette: ...That's what she told me. Whether it would prove useful or not, I wanted to pass that information on to you.
Paimon: The remains... of the Third Descender?
Paimon: So that's what the Gnoses actually are? Paimon just thought that they looked like chess pieces. How could they be a person's remains?
Neuvillette: All the same, assuming that there was no misunderstanding or special metaphor at play, that is what she meant to say.
Paimon: And she said that it would bring "misfortune" and that you should chuck it, which is why you gave it to the Fatui...
Neuvillette: If she speaks the truth, then I would simply be putting Fontaine at unnecessary risk by keeping it here.
Traveler: (A Descender... She mentioned one of them...)
Traveler: I am the Fourth Descender.
Traveler: One, that the Gnoses are related to Descenders.
Neuvillette: I had guessed that you might already be familiar with this concept, but I did not expect you to be one of them.
Neuvillette: That means that the Gnoses, which are exceedingly element-compatible and can even enhance elemental abilities, do indeed come from the Third Descender.
Neuvillette: Hmm, I wonder... Does your body also possess similar properties?
Paimon: Like... Uhh, like being able to use elemental powers without a Vision? That does sorta count as special compatibility, right?
Paimon: No, no, let's not think about this stuff right now. It just feels creepy...
Paimon: #...Comparing Traveler to the dead Third Descender and all...
Traveler: Don't worry, I won't die so easily.
Paimon: That's what you say, but this topic still feels like bad luck.
Paimon: Once Childe recovers, let's get some more answers out of him — or go look for his Master and get the answers that way!
Neuvillette: I, too, believe it unwise to make too many blind guesses when information is lacking. The same is true of being at court.
Paimon: Alright. Whatever the case, it seems like the crisis here in Fontaine's over for now.
Neuvillette: Yes. All of Focalors' efforts were for this moment as well.
Paimon: But... She sacrificed herself in the end as a god, and she suffered through all those years as a human... Was that really what she wanted?
Neuvillette: ...I suppose that would be the mystery of a god's will.
Traveler: Can you understand the will of the gods?
Neuvillette: I suspect not. But once in a while, I too would guess that if wishes were like the clouds in the sky, they will one day return to the earth as raindrops...
Neuvillette: Life flows like water, and rain is the final answer. The water levels may sometimes tilt one way or another, but the rain falls fairly upon all.
Neuvillette: And what, ultimately, is the difference between the rains that fall upon all of us?
Traveler: And two, that the one who came before me has already died.
Traveler: For me, this information means two things.

## Talk 7

Jurieu: Here are the interview notes. They mention that the flying ship may have many uses in the future, and the journalist asked me what I thought of them...
Jurieu: ...Seriously, how would I know anything about that? Flight is just flight. Whether people want to use a flying ship to broadcast good news or organize weddings is none of my beeswax.
Lourvine: A wedding... Huh?
Jurieu: ...
Lourvine: ...
Jurieu: Why are you looking at me like that?
Lourvine: So, the flying ship can be used for weddings?
Jurieu: I didn't say that. That journalist mentioned it... And what does that have to do with us, anyway?
Lourvine: ...True. What does that have to do with us?

## Talk 8

Sigewinne: *sigh* You know, I'd love to see you in one of Charlotte's photoshoots one day.
Wriothesley: Is that really necessary? Our line of work doesn't really require much photographing.
Sigewinne: It's precisely because we don't need the pictures that they'll have value as keepsakes. You don't really look all that opposed to the idea, you know.
Wriothesley: Maybe I'm just happy that I managed to once again avoid the spotlight. I think this interview went well, either way.
Sigewinne: Yes, you successfully kept prying eyes away by using Mr. Jurieu and Miss Lourvine as shields. Very good.
Wriothesley: You should be happy for them. They have a bright future ahead of them.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: So you really are here, Neuvillette! Paimon didn't think you were going to have free time this hour of the day.
Neuvillette: "Really"? Ah, I suppose you must have met Mr. Lyney. He took the time to greet me earlier when he passed this way.
Neuvillette: In any case, you came at a good time. I was just considering reaching out to you to set up a meeting, so I may explain some things that I haven't had the time to before.
Paimon: Aww, Paimon's glad that you remembered! Thank you for keeping us on your mind, what with you being busy and all.
Paimon: Alright, let's have it, then. How was Fontaine actually saved? That whole business is still quite the mystery to us.
Neuvillette: ...
Neuvillette: ...Hmm. It is strange, how words can often leave a bitter taste in the mouth when it finally comes time to say them out loud.
Black Screen Text: Neuvillette sighs softly, before telling you the truth concerning what he saw that day...
Black Screen Text: "Focalors deceived the Heavenly Principles, and used Furina's endless performance to save Fontaine."
Paimon: Wow... So that's what happened?
Traveler: I only saw Furina's part, myself.
Paimon: Focalors destroyed the divine throne of the Hydro Archon and restored your power to you, transforming you into a fully-fledged elemental dragon sovereign...
Paimon: But Paimon still doesn't quite get what you did to save the Fontainians from dissolving.
Neuvillette: For me, the "authority of the ancient dragons" refers to absolute control over the Hydro element.
Neuvillette: Fontainians were "incomplete humans" born of Egeria's use of the power of the Primordial Sea, with constitutions similar to that of mimics...
Neuvillette: But so long as those primordial energies remain within them, I could use the ancient dragons' authority to grant them true "blood," after the fashion in which life was first brought into being on this planet.
Neuvillette: In other words, when I gave my verdict, Fontainians became "true humans," and thus would naturally no longer be dissolved by water from the Primordial Sea.
Paimon: Focalors must have counted on you to make that decision as well... Your verdict was the key to making the prophecy appear to have come true while saving everyone.
Traveler: You could say that it was at that moment...
Paimon: Yeah, and in a manner of speaking, Focalors finally managed to fulfill the original Hydro Archon's wish to turn Oceanids into real people, too.
Neuvillette: ...
Neuvillette: It seems, from your expressions, that you still have more things you wish to ask.
Neuvillette: Ask away. I will tell you the truth as I know it.
Traveler: About the initial verdict that was passed on Childe...
Neuvillette: I have investigated his case along many avenues, and I have learned that he once fell into an unknown chasm when he was young. There, by chance, he awakened the All-Devouring Narwhal.
Neuvillette: But, whether it be by sentiment or reason, that should not have been enough to consider him the root cause of the disaster. At most, he would have had tangential liability.
Neuvillette: As for the judgment passed by the Oratrice during the trial...
Neuvillette: Whether it was due to that liability by association, or Focalors deliberately using him to buy time for us on the assumption that he would be able to hold the creature off... I cannot say.
Paimon: Guess Focalors had Fontainians in mind the whole time. In the end, it was thanks to her that they finally became real humans...
Paimon: Uh, hang on a second! Paimon's suddenly got another question.
Paimon: Back when Fontainians hadn't yet become real humans, were the children they had also transformed Oceanids?
Neuvillette: Life has always flowed like water. Do you recall how Fontainians would often come to the Fountain of Lucine to pray for children?
Paimon: Yeah. Lynette said that the Fountain is where all the waters in Fontaine converge...
Neuvillette: In truth, even those couples did not know that such prayers were no mere custom, but instead a form of ritual...
Neuvillette: Those Oceanids who were blessed within the spring water would later descend as new humans in the coming months.
Paimon: Uh... Paimon... sorta gets it now? Either way, seems like this ritual won't be of any further use — but it'll probably live on as a local custom!
Paimon: Uh, hang on a sec. Paimon's still got a question about the Gnosis...
Paimon: When we spoke to Lyney earlier, he mentioned that your attitude towards giving away the Gnosis had clearly changed...
Paimon: We guessed that there might be some reason for it that only you were aware of...
Neuvillette: Hmm. No wonder the House of the Hearth is the Fatui's intelligence division. They are certainly sharp.
Neuvillette: So, regarding this specific issue, I was just getting ready to share something with you.
Paimon: Uh... What is it?
Neuvillette: In truth, I exchanged some further words with that lady named Skirk after sending you two back to the surface. It went something like this...
Traveler: About Fontaine's future...
Paimon: Yeah, about that, Wriothesley said Furina has already left. What's that all about?
Neuvillette: Ah, Lady Furina... The people are only aware that her death sentence has not been carried out. She abdicated the post of Hydro Archon and left affairs related to that title to me, before leaving the opera house.
Neuvillette: I related Focalors' words to her faithfully and completely. After hearing them, she seemed neither saddened nor comforted...
Neuvillette: She simply said that... she was tired, and needed to rest.
Neuvillette: Having said that, she then packed her things and moved out of the opera house, not unlike how an ordinary person might.
Paimon: Erm... But she's still got a place to stay, right?
Neuvillette: You need not worry. I will make arrangements to ensure that she will not want for food, clothing, board, or travel.
Neuvillette: In truth, I am... somewhat happy for her. The wear and tear on her spirit will, of course, take time to heal...
Neuvillette: But now that she no longer has to play the role of "Focalors the Hydro Archon," she can finally lay down her burdens and lead a normal life.
Paimon: What about you, then? What are your plans, now that you've regained your full powers as the Hydro Dragon?
Neuvillette: After Focalors passed on, the Oratrice also ceased to function.
Neuvillette: This matter will directly affect our trials. After much careful consideration, I've decided to take over its role in our courts. From now on, I shall hear cases and pass verdicts by myself.
Paimon: Looks like you're still considering stuff from the perspective of the Iudex, huh.
Neuvillette: As an elemental dragon, there are indeed many things that I must do. But this power, and this duty... In a manner of speaking, you could say that both were granted to me.
Neuvillette: As such, before I attend to my other responsibilities, I must first and foremost continue to serve Fontaine as its highest judge. The duty of the Hydro Sovereign and the duty of the Iudex shall coexist within my person.
Neuvillette: Additionally, the Hydro Archon's departure has brought about another problem... Which is that the opera house shall no longer produce Indemnitium.
Paimon: That's true. That power was derived from the peoples' faith in the Hydro Archon, wasn't it?
Paimon: Wait. But the various meks and machines in the city are all still okay. Where are they getting their energy from?
Neuvillette: As I am now, I have full command over Pneumousia, and it can serve as a complete substitute — another reason why I cannot quite leave Fontaine immediately.
Paimon: Wow. This ancient dragon's authority stuff is really quite useful, huh?
Traveler: About Fontaine's Gnosis...
Paimon: Ooh, that's right. They say you've given it to The Knave as a "diplomatic gift," or something...
Neuvillette: Leaving aside their intentionality, the two Fatui Harbingers have indeed done much for us during this crisis.
Neuvillette: Their sole remaining goal in Fontaine, at least at this point, would seem to be the Gnosis.
Neuvillette: The Oratrice has ceased to function. The Hydro Archon's divine throne is now no more. And I do not need the Gnosis's power...
Neuvillette: As such, it has lost all meaning for Fontaine.
Neuvillette: If the Fatui have impure designs, then we might as well accede to their request now... and avoid unnecessary conflict.
Paimon: Gah, what complicated considerations... Paimon thought you were just giving it to them out of gratitude to The Knave, and as an apology to Childe.
Traveler: About the next stop on my journey...
Neuvillette: You will soon be heading to Natlan, I presume?
Neuvillette: I'm afraid that I have little talent as a travel guide, so all I can do is tell you what I know about that land.
Neuvillette: As far as I'm aware, Natlan can be said to be "a nation of dragons."
Paimon: A nation of dragons? You mean, like you?
Neuvillette: No, I suspect that I would not find myself welcome there.
Neuvillette: Unlike ancient dragons such as myself, the dragons of Natlan have undergone long years of development and evolution. Large numbers of them have entered a form of coexistence with humanity.
Neuvillette: Natlan is also the nation of "war." War ravages those lands like an undying flame.
Neuvillette: There is one other piece of information I got incidentally from my negotiations with The Knave that I believe may be useful to you.
Neuvillette: ...The Harbinger known as The Captain has thrown his hat into the endless ring of war.
Paimon: "The Captain"... Sounds like a real tough customer. Seriously, everywhere you look, there's a Fatui Harbinger doing their thing!
Neuvillette: I suggest that you fully prepare yourself before going to Natlan. In the meantime, Fontaine's doors will always be open to you.
Traveler: I have no more questions.
Traveler: That the Fontainians were finally truly "born."

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: ...Well, we're going to head topside to see what's going on. You hurry over soon as well, alright, Neuvillette...
Paimon: Whoa...!
Neuvillette: What next...
Skirk: Hmm. The All-Devouring Narwhal isn't here, so I'm no longer getting any interference.
Skirk: I can finally catch the scent of your power... what it's made of.
Skirk: It is the authority of the planet's primordial dragons, but with something very similar to a god's "curse" mixed in... It's quite a novel blend.
Skirk: I'm sure I've encountered something like this before. What was it again...
Neuvillette: I do not know what you speak of.
Skirk: Ah, of course... How could I forget:
Skirk: You should have the "remains of the Third Descender" on your person, yes?
Neuvillette: Remains? I've never heard of any such thing.
Skirk: Huh... According to your parlance, I believe it may be called a "Gnosis"?
Neuvillette: ...Well, that much is true. After Focalors' divinity faded, she handed her Gnosis to me.
Neuvillette: But I fear I have never heard it described in the manner that you just did.
Skirk: I've been training with my Master, "The Foul," ever since I was young, and I have never returned to the surface since, so most of the information I possess, I got from him.
Skirk: It is only natural for those who are greater than humanity to possess a different sort of common sense, which is why there are so many problems in our attempts to communicate with humans.
Skirk: Regardless, you should probably get rid of objects of "misfortune," to prevent any disasters from befalling you.
Skirk: To live is in itself a blessing. But once a person dies, the bonds he once had with this world shall all turn to curses.
Neuvillette: What do you mean by that?
Skirk: No need to fret. These are just my... personal thoughts — and my reason for no longer wishing to return to the surface.
Neuvillette: This Third Descender you refer to. Who are they? And when did they die?
Skirk: Master never mentioned them to me. Perhaps it just wasn't that important for me to know.
Skirk: If you're interested, though, I could ask him. I'll be sure to pass the answer on to you next time.
Neuvillette: Next time... You believe we will meet again?
Skirk: I do... Wait, I have a disciple of my own, don't I? He can be the messenger, then.
