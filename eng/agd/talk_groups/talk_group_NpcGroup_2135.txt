Uncle Ghast: Oh? Come and have a chat, kid. Who knows — if the influence of those meteorites gets any stronger, there'll be no one to talk to but in your dreams. *chuckles*

Traveler: So, about Little Liu...
Uncle Ghast: Little Liu... Little Liu... Ah yes, I know her. But I've been here all this while, and she didn't pass this way.

Traveler: And you are...?
Uncle Ghast: Hehe, the brats in the village call me Uncle Ghast, for I am never without a ghost story to tell.
Uncle Ghast: Well, would like you to hear a story too? Well then, ground yourself well, lest a single scare sets your legs to trembling!
Traveler: Sure.
Uncle Ghast: There was once a young lass called Dusky Ming, a cute and precocious girl, but one whose luck was poor. She suffered from a terrible illness, and died young.
Uncle Ghast: Her mother washed her face with tears, and would not leave the house, for the blow was too much for her to bear.
Uncle Ghast: But one day, there was a knock, knock, knock at their door. Frightened, her mother carefully pushed the door open...
Uncle Ghast: ...and when she looked, there was a piping hot bowl of meat soup and a plate of cooked meat, but not a soul in sight. Not comprehending this, Dusky Ming's mother followed the trail of that wonderful aroma...
Uncle Ghast: Only to stumble right into a hilichurl camp. Quickly they surrounded her, and oh, how her eyes grew wide with fright.
Uncle Ghast: But the moment passed, and all she heard was the chanting of "Dada... Dada..." The mother opened her eyes as quickly as she dared, and what did she see?
Uncle Ghast: The hilichurls dancing, dancing Dusky Ming's favorite dance!
Uncle Ghast: Just then, she felt something bump into her from behind, and though she could see no one, she could smell a familiar fragrance.
Uncle Ghast: Tears rolled down the mother's face, for then she knew that her Dusky Ming was not lonely in the afterlife, no indeed — she had instead made herself many an adorable friend...
Traveler: I feel rather moved instead...
Uncle Ghast: What are you babbling about? Dusky Ming is a ghost — is that not enough to frighten folk?
Uncle Ghast: How does your mind even tick...
Traveler: That was a little scary.
Uncle Ghast: Hehe... This is the ghost story I am most proud of, after all. It has never failed me yet!
Uncle Ghast: Most important of all, this story is real as real can be.
Traveler: I'll pass...
Uncle Ghast: Hmph. And here I thought you would have a little more guts than those brats.
Uncle Ghast: Well, it's alright, it's alright.
