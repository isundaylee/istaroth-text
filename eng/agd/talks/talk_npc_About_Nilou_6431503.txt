Traveler: About Nilou...
Kumari: I love Nilou! She's so gorgeous, and her voice is so melodious, and her dance is stunning...
Kumari: Every time I see Nilou, she would smile and let me touch the jewelry on her head.
Kumari: The Sabzeruz Festival is my favorite holiday. I can get candies from the Knight of Flowers, and I can watch Nilou's dance that day!
