Traveler: About that cat...
Enteka: Ah, you must have spotted Gata.
Enteka: Gata's not even a year old yet so she's still a very curious kitty. Whenever I read people's fortunes from the coffee grounds, she'll jump up to watch.
Enteka: If you'd like, you can give her head a good pat. She'll get happy and start purring, and you'll get to enjoy the softest feeling in the world.
