Traveler: What is it you're doing here?
Taliesin: I consider myself a bard of the old school, so of course I'm here to get some inspiration.
Taliesin: That said, I've never gone down into a mine before... and in my hurry to get here, I wound up... pulling a muscle.
Taliesin: Ow ow ow...

Taliesin: #We meet again, golden-haired Traveler!
Traveler: Taliesin, have you come for a duel?
Paimon: Wait, what are you saying?
Taliesin: Haha, I'm here to get some inspiration, of course! Listen to this: the hero without a past, bereft of any clan, and their loyal fairy retainer!
Paimon: No idea who you're talking about.
Traveler: Yup. No idea here either.
Taliesin: Look, look! O modest hero, do not cast your perplexed gaze towards the distant mountains, for in this benighted land, you are the very light itself!
Paimon: Eh?
Traveler: What...?
Taliesin: I'm talking about you! In my current written template, of course.
Traveler: Ah...
Paimon: Huh, so this guy can actually say things we understand.
Traveler: See you.
Taliesin: #See you, gold-haired Traveler!
Traveler: What are you doing here?

## Talk 6

Taliesin: Hmm... no, no. That's not how that goes. According to the genealogy...
Taliesin: Ooh? Oh! Hello, sorry, didn't see you there!
Traveler: You...
Taliesin: #{F#Shh! Shh! Ahem! She comes, she comes! Her eyes bright as the moon inimitable, her armor formidable, invincible! She is—}{M#Shh! Shh! Ahem! He comes, he comes! His sword shining like the moon so silver, at his footsteps even armies shiver! He is—}
Paimon: Blon—die—!
Traveler: What!?
Paimon: Hehe... Sorry, force of habit. It just slipped out, y'know?
Traveler: What sort of habit is that, seriously...
Paimon: Hmm, Paimon supposes that the nickname could be uglier...
Traveler: Hey!
Taliesin: Hahahaha! Well said, good Paimon, well said!
Taliesin: #{F#She}{M#He} is the golden-haired Traveler!
Traveler: I object to these terrible-sounding, non-consensual appellations.
Taliesin: Apologies, apologies... I did not mean to offend. But more "old-school" poets from Mondstadt do tend to begin like that.
Traveler: "Old-school"?
Taliesin: Well, if you'll let me clarify, I don't mean old-school folksongs like the "Dandelion Madrigals" or old-school romances like "Marriage, You Cheat, How I Hate Thee"...
Taliesin: I'm referring to old-school historical epic poetry.
Traveler: And what might that be?
Taliesin: Ah, simply put, it is the adaptation of heroic genealogies, the adding of flesh and skin atop the skeletal frame of history!
Taliesin: These epics sing of history through long-form poetry, awakening people to the knowledge of times past. Well, there you have it — the epic, and its value to society.
Taliesin: The ability of poetry to awaken historical consciousness was precisely why it was banned all those years ago by the aristocracy.
Taliesin: They feared that we would recall our former freedom and our history of resistance.
Taliesin: And that is why I despise the popular poetry of the day and seek to revive these "old-school epics."
Traveler: I see. Bye.
Taliesin: #Um, right, then. See you, golden-haired Traveler!
Traveler: That lacked creativity in the extreme.
Traveler: Paimon!
Traveler: I'm...
