Chasca's specialty. Piled high with ingredients, few can resist the aroma of this dish. Even someone in the midst of an argument might find their anger turn to hunger at the mere whiff of it. Wait a moment, those Saurians who were rolling around in the distance just now... Why have they suddenly started looking this way too?
