Traveler: How do you like it here?
Mualani: Hehe, I feel right at home! But it takes a lot to faze me — I've always been comfortable with new places and new faces.
Mualani: By the way, did you know that most Saurian companions can get real territorial? They only let people they know into their space.
Mualani: Since you invited me here, that means you consider me a good friend — and that's a real honor! Heh, I'm so happy, I've been smiling all day!
Traveler: That's right. That's me, a terrifyingly territorial Saurian.
Mualani: Hahaha! Then I gotta say, I like what you've done with your lair!
Mualani: In Natlan, Saurians are like friends and family to us. They're an irreplaceable part of our lives.
Mualani: You're important to me as well, as one of my close friends. That's why I made that analogy in the first place.
Traveler: Eee!
Mualani: ...Eh?
Traveler: How about that? Sounds like a happy Koholasaur?
Mualani: Hahaha! Okay, yeah, I gotcha!
Mualani: Eee! Eee! Eee!
Traveler: How does a Saurian show when they're happy? Is there a specific sound they make?
Mualani: Eh? Hahaha, that's a tough one. Ummm... Why don't we make one up?
Mualani: It can be like a secret code we use just with each other! A happy signal, to show when we're in a good mood, or use as a greeting, or even as a laugh!
