# A Starry Night, as Remembered


## Talk 1

Jeroney: Why are you up here yourself? There isn't even a rail line here, and it's way high up at the very edge of the Mirage.
Jeroney: People rarely come here. Even Idyia... Heh, I doubt she even knows this place exists.
Paimon: So if there's nothing here, why are you here, Jeroney?
Jeroney: I just came out for a little fresh air... Hey, don't give me that "you ran away from home after arguing with Ferdinand again" look!
Jeroney: Come on, there really wasn't an argument. I'm just taking a stroll out of, well, I don't know, personal interest!
Jeroney: I suppose you already knew that the Choo-Choo Cart was my idea. At that time, I was only thinking: What's something that could easily reach great heights...
Jeroney: So I... So Jeroney brainstormed the Choo-Choo Cart and the rails, all for the love of the sky and heights.
Jeroney: Sounds silly, doesn't it? I remember Inazuma has a saying that goes something like, "only idiots and smoke like to rise up high"...
Traveler: It's awesome that you could think up the Choo-Choo Cart.
Jeroney: But it can only exist in the Veluriyam Mirage.
Jeroney: ...Forget it, let's not talk about it. I also came here to stargaze.
Jeroney: I know the stars here are merely an ephemeral shadow from outside the Mirage, but they're pretty enough for me.
Jeroney: Every night when I look upon the starry sky... I feel so peaceful.
Traveler: The one who loves the starry sky... is it Jeroney...?
Jeroney: But whoever sees a starry sky like that couldn't help but fall in love with it. If only I could see the stars in the daytime...
Jeroney: Or even better, if I didn't have to climb up here every day!
Paimon: Wait! That's possible! Paimon's got an idea!
Jeroney: Huh? Really?
Traveler: We can just take a photo...
Jeroney: Pho... Photo? That sounds like some advanced technology.
Paimon: Yeah, why don't we take a photo of the starry sky for Jeroney?
Jeroney: Can you really do that?
Traveler: Of course you can!
Paimon: But... Paimon isn't sure of any good spots to take pictures of the starry night...
Jeroney: Here! At night, on the platform here, you can see the most beautiful starscape! That's the reason I came here in the first place.
Paimon: Really? Great! Jeroney, you just wait for our photo!
Traveler: I think it is so much fun.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Jeroney, we're back~! See, this is the photo! Check it out!
Jeroney: ...Wow, it looks just like what my eyes would see.
Jeroney: Are you really giving me this photo?
Paimon: Of course, we took it just for you!
Jeroney: Haha, thank you... thank you so much. I never thought I'd see such amazing technology. With technology like this, maybe one day we will also be able to build a Choo-Choo Cart outside the Mirage.
Jeroney: What a gorgeous night sky... If only we had technology like this back then, then... then he would have been able to see this beautiful sight whenever he wanted.

## Talk 4

Jeroney: Photos... I can't believe something so amazing exists already. Now, it's possible to keep a record of all kinds of amazing scenery...
Jeroney: #Well, {NICKNAME}, did you finish taking the photo? I'm really looking forward to seeing your photo of the starry sky!
