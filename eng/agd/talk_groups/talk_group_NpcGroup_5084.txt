Traveler: Hello there.
Iaune: Hello! I'll get the materials needed today right away— Oh, it's you!
Iaune: We meet again, Traveler. It's my pleasure.
Iaune: And no, that's not mere formality. Seeing you is like seeing a gear turning on an intricate axis within a clock — it's as if my life is still on the right track.

Traveler: Don't think too hard about stuff, alright?
Iaune: ...You're right. I have to put my past frustrations behind me and just take the useful experience on.

Traveler: Still feeling the pressure?
Iaune: Well... yeah.
Iaune: I'm not ashamed to admit that. It just means that I'm "taking every problem too seriously"!
Iaune: That's what Roialte and Semaine always tell me, anyway.
Iaune: But I still don't believe that being serious is a bad thing. That's why I've expanded the document workload here by three times, I suppose.
Iaune: But don't worry too much about me. I'll do my best to finish my work. You go about your day too, alright?

## Talk 4

Iaune: Time to plan a camping trip... Fishing, or mountain climbing? Should I ask Estelle to come along?

### Talk 4 related talk 0

Traveler: Planning a vacation, are we?
Iaune: That might be a bit of an overstatement. I'm just considering what to do on an off day.
Iaune: I'm currently trying to avoid thinking about work when not at work... Emphasis on "trying."

Traveler: That's a pretty good idea, actually.
Iaune: Yes. But walking the walk isn't as easy as talking the talk...
Iaune: Thank you so much for your help. Please accept these humble gifts that I caught myself.

## Talk 6

Traveler: Have fun.
Iaune: Thank you!

## Talk 7

Iaune: ...I just can't believe it. Would someone really take a Kamera into the Maison Gestion itself, and simply strut about taking pictures of everyone and anything?
Iaune: It is ridiculous! Everyone knows, everyone should know, that that is how secrets get leaked! It is common sense!
Roialte: If common sense was common, Mr. Iaune, then the Maison Gestion could simply disband tomorrow.
Roialte: I shall leave this to you. Have them sign the document, just like I taught you, and return it to me before the weekend.
Roialte: I still have to handle the expense receipts. Carsix keeps hassling me about it.
Iaune: But, Mr. Roialte, just who should I be looking for? We don't have an office specifically in charge of Kameras.
Roialte: Uh... I trust your judgment. Now hurry up and take care of this, so we can each really enjoy the weekend! I'm going to go take care of other things. Hop to it, kid!
Iaune: Yessir, Mr. Roialte.
Black Screen Text: Roialte leaves in a leisurely manner...
Traveler: What are you doing?
Iaune: Huh? Hello, hello. It looks, though, you are not a member of the staff here at the Maison Gestion.
Iaune: I am currently busy with official business. Should you have any inquiries, please ask Ms. Cornelia. She's right over there.
Iaune: She will provide you with a chair and a cup of tea. Please have a seat, and I will come find you after I am done.
Traveler: What's the big rush?
Iaune: *sigh* It's... It's actually a simple matter, but dealing with it is quite complicated...
Iaune: The office I work in has received a notice instructing us to draft a letter to the other offices.
Iaune: The content was something like, staff are forbidden from bringing Kameras into the Maison Gestion and taking pictures, except for work purposes, in order to avoid leakage of secret information.
Traveler: Does telling me about the letter's contents constitute leaking secrets?
Iaune: No, certainly not. If anyone really had used a Kamera to take a photo of documents, and it resulted in a leak, then this would certainly be a confidential matter.
Iaune: However, "maybe someone will use a Kamera to take a picture of documents in order to leak them" is not a secret. After all, that's a possibility that everyone is aware of.
Traveler: I feel dizzy...
Iaune: Think about it this way: If you are guarding a secret, then the secret you are guarding certainly cannot be revealed.
Iaune: But the fact that "you are guarding a secret" itself may not be considered secret.
Iaune: After all, if even the fact that "you are guarding a secret" is considered a secret, then you will fall into an endless cycle of keeping the secret of keeping secrets.
Paimon: Your wording is an endless cycle!
Traveler: I'm curious who is in charge of this matter...
Iaune: That is where this matter becomes complicated. There is no office in the entire Maison Gestion that is directly charged with managing Kameras.
Iaune: Mr. Semaine says that I should ask Mr. Gattineo. Their work is related to confidential matters, and thus they should be the first to be made aware.
Iaune: But Mr. Roialte says that I should ask Difor, as he is in charge of all matters related to the staff of the Maison Gestion.
Iaune: Were we to make a new rule that all staff of the Maison Gestion cannot bring Kameras to work, we'd have to let them know.
Paimon: Wow... That's complicated... Why are there so many different people responsible for different things? What happens if you can't remember?
Iaune: That's why each of us carries a thick notepad. Though even with the notes, I'm still not sure who I should look for now...
Traveler: Then who is responsible for this?

### Talk 7 related talk 0

Traveler: This is a confidential matter. Let's look for Gattineo.
Iaune: That's exactly what I thought. Mr. Gattineo is quite affable, and is also an "exemplary Gestionnaire."
Iaune: Even though all the matters he deals with are of utmost importance, he still handles each matter with aplomb. His work can truly be called outstanding.

### Talk 7 related talk 1

Traveler: This is a matter involving personnel. Let's look for Difor.
Iaune: That's exactly what I thought, but he has quite the explosive temper, and though he is quite reliable, his sharp tongue is sure to leave a mark.
Iaune: *sigh* But he must be informed of this matter as soon as possible...
