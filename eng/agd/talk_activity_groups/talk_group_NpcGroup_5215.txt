Traveler: About the Mail Room...
Rosolino: You pay with Coupons. Tell us the recipient and their address and we'll get the letter there, if it's in Fontaine. The letter can't be too long, and the content... well, work that out yourself.
Rosolino: And I advise you not to inquire about anything else.

## Talk

Traveler: Okay, thanks.
Rosolino: Don't mention it.

Rosolino: Not bad! You might look young, but you're clearly an old hand when it comes to cards!
