# Missing title (2660526647)

Director-in-Chief: Hi! I'm the Acting Director of this attraction. Do you have any questions for me?
Traveler: The Water Droplet is speaking!
Paimon: Whoa! The Water Droplet is speaking again! And its voice is slightly different...
Paimon: Eh? Why did Paimon say "again?"
Director-in-Chief: Haha! Your reaction is exactly as I expected!
Director-in-Chief: Don't be so surprised, and listen carefully. The sound is coming from the speaker by the wall.
Director-in-Chief: I'm speaking to you via prerecorded lines... Anyway, it was Idy... Ah! I mean Daiya who prepared these lines in advance!
Director-in-Chief: As for the specifics, you can talk to Engineer. His explanation will certainly be clearer and more comprehensive!
Paimon: S-So that's what's going on!
Paimon: For some reason, it feels like anything is possible when we're in the miraculous Veluriyam Mirage...
Traveler: Why are you the "Acting" Director?
Director-in-Chief: That's a good question! It's because I don't think I'm the best candidate for the job...
Director-in-Chief: My partners and I were all more or less influenced by Director Zosimos, and we're equals in terms of talent.
Director-in-Chief: We're busy expanding our repertoire and polishing our skills.
Director-in-Chief: My partners often present ideas to me, and sometimes, Fake Playwright goes over my head and just does things.
Director-in-Chief: But as long as the majority supports it, and the show is good, then I'm happy too!
Director-in-Chief: If one of the others becomes more capable than me and wishes to manage the project, I would immediately give up the position!
Paimon: You're too humble. Shouldn't a director be more forceful? If you're always accommodating the opinions of others, it's bound to lead to arguments, isn't it?
Traveler: Maybe this mentality is for the better?
Paimon: You have a point... If it's the result of careful discussion, then maybe you could put together lots of creative ideas...
Director-in-Chief: Of course, any interested guests are welcome to try as well. Perhaps one of them will be a better director than I!
Director-in-Chief: Like the two of you! You're clearly talented!
Paimon: Huh? Us?
Traveler: Wanna give it a shot, Paimon?
Paimon: Well, now that Paimon thinks about it, performing with the Water Droplets would be really interesting!
Paimon: #Paimon will leave the writing to Traveler and focus on directing!
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon will leave communicating with the Water Droplets to you too. You're really good at that kind of thing!
Traveler: Are you gonna make me run errands too?
Paimon: That's not what you should be focusing on! Just think about it... The more responsibility you have, the more you can mold the show to your liking!
Paimon: If we're going to turn our stories into an interesting play, you're the best person to deal with all the details!
Director-in-Chief: Shall we start discussing things now? I'm so fired up!
Director-in-Chief: However, producing a play is no easy task! You'll encounter all sorts of challenges!
Director-in-Chief: I suggest you speak with the others and mentally prepare yourselves.
Paimon: Director Water Droplet, that's so considerate of you. But, y'know, there's no need to be so modest! I'm certain you're a great director!
Traveler: Are meals provided?
Traveler: You might become a great director!
Traveler: Group projects are complicated.
Traveler: About the directing methodology for the "Three-Day Reverie"...
Paimon: Methodology? What methodology...
Paimon: Oh! Right!
Paimon: Paimon was wondering about the decision behind using narration and dialogue to help guests imagine the scenes in the play!
Director-in-Chief: About that... if I'm being honest... it's actually pretty simple...
Director-in-Chief: It's mainly... we're broke.
Traveler: ?
Paimon: ?
Director-in-Chief: Actually, everything you've experienced is a result of compromise.
Director-in-Chief: I've only seen a few of Director Zosimos's films, so I have some hazy ideas. But we encountered great difficulty trying to realize them.
Director-in-Chief: During planning, each scene only had a few lines, but many actors, props, and backdrops, all of which cost a lot.
Director-in-Chief: In the words of Zosimos, money could solve any problem back in his homeland. But in Veluriyam Mirage, the only currency to spend is the labor hours of us Hydro Eidolons.
Director-in-Chief: Consider the Black Nacre and the All-Devouring Kraken, for example. If we were to recreate a fully armed pirate ship, a huge mechanical sea monster, and even dig out a large expanse of water for the performance...
Director-in-Chief: It would take millions, maybe even billions of Mora! If we convert it into working hours for us Hydro Eidolons, it would take months, even if we got all our friends to help!
Paimon: Th-That much!? Paimon actually underestimated the cost!?
Director-in-Chief: That's why we gave up on most backdrops and props and chose to focus our efforts on the Choo-Choo Cart and the final battle.
Director-in-Chief: That way, we'd be able to give our audience a few unforgettable experiences, instead of everything being equally mediocre and forgettable.
Paimon: That kinda makes sense. The Choo-Choo Cart in the Black Nacre was amazing. At the very least, it felt like a ship, and the final battle was pretty special.
Paimon: Sounds like something we heard in Liyue... What was it again?
Traveler: Prioritizing?
Paimon: Right, that's it! It's about focusing on what's important and necessary!
Paimon: Is that also why there weren't any actors for the dialogue or a narrator on stage, and just speakers?
Director-in-Chief: That's purely because we don't have enough actors.
Director-in-Chief: Originally, we all agreed to go on stage as actors once we had completed our other responsibilities...
Director-in-Chief: The friend you saw in "Petrifying Gaze" was our star actor, trained by Zosimos himself, Actaholic!
Director-in-Chief: Actaholic even planned to give a surprise lesson, but since none of us finished our work on time, Actaholic was left as the only actor onstage.
Director-in-Chief: In short, the shortage of actors and labor are two sides of the same difficult coin, and is holding us back now more than ever!
Paimon: Ugh, rehearsing for a show doesn't seem easy at all. Being a director is such tiring work...
Paimon: That Water Droplet looks so lonely. Let's go comfort it if we get a chance!
Traveler: Making compromises?
Traveler: About the other members of the troupe...
Director-in-Chief: Well, I really want to introduce everyone in the troupe to you, but ever since Zosimos enlightened us, we've each been busy pursuing all sorts of knowledge.
Director-in-Chief: Every one of them has formed a... unique personality now. It's really way too complicated to try and convey everything over the broadcast system.
Director-in-Chief: Also, there's a lot of new words and voice lines that Engineer hasn't finished working on yet.
Director-in-Chief: So, I can't explain things with recordings yet. You'll have to speak to them yourselves.
Paimon: Hold on! Paimon needs some time to digest all of that! Did Paimon hear something about another Water Droplet?
Traveler: "Voice lines"?
Director-in-Chief: ...
Director-in-Chief: (The director seems to be gesturing and acting out something, but it's almost impossible to figure out...)
Paimon: Looks like there's nothing we can do. Director Water Droplet doesn't have the ability to talk about that topic!
Paimon: Let's do what it said and speak to the others.
Paimon: If we get a chance, we should ask Engineer about the voice lines the director mentioned.
Traveler: Pardon us for a moment!
Director-in-Chief: How polite of you! If you have any questions about the show, feel free to ask me!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Fake Playwright: Hi, esteemed audience members! I'm Fake Playwright, one of the staff working on Three-Day Reverie. Can I help you with anything?
Traveler: Why are you known as "Fake Playwright"?
Fake Playwright: That's a good question! It seems I have some explaining to do.
Fake Playwright: Long story short, if I can't write anything appropriate soon, I'll be fired!
Paimon: Whoa! Is it that bad? You make it sound like... Water Droplets have strict rules too!
Traveler: Appropriate? What do you mean?
Fake Playwright: No, not at all. Dialogue is the easiest part!
Fake Playwright: Writing beautiful lines, fooling the audience into thinking the lines are something profound...
Fake Playwright: That's something any Hydro Eidolon with just a few months of intensive training... No, even a Specter could do that!
Fake Playwright: But to transform a splendid section of the play into the scene before your eyes, now that cannot be done without a careful division of labor and cooperation. That is the essence of being "appropriate"!
Traveler: Clear as mud.
Paimon: Could you explain it in a way that Paimon can understand?
Fake Playwright: No surprise there. It takes a certain amount of creative experience to resonate with this topic.
Fake Playwright: Then I'll slow down enough to give you time to catch up. A good playwright must understand the troupe's limits and resources, and write the script with those in mind.
Fake Playwright: Even if it's the simplest of scenes, you must carefully determine the actors and props required.
Fake Playwright: But as you can see, we plain don't have enough actors and our prop selection is relatively limited as well.
Fake Playwright: So, you certainly can't go overboard when writing the script because once it's in the show, the audience may feel a deep disconnect between what is described and what is shown.
Fake Playwright: My failure to take that into consideration resulted in me writing a few unrealistic and entirely unusable scripts, and it even ended up delaying the schedule of the entire troupe...
Traveler: Ouch...
Paimon: If worse comes to worst, then... Paimon will just draw figures on wooden boards and use them as actors! Paimon can draw some props on wood too... y'know, signal the audience!
Paimon: Hmm, we can install a few wheels on the bottom and move them around to display character movement or interact with props.
Paimon: If we slam them together and throw in some exaggerated sound effects, we can even recreate fight scenes!
Paimon: It'll be just like when the sea monster's minions showed up in the Black Nacre play!
Traveler: Economical showmanship!
Fake Playwright: No! Absolutely not! According to Mr. Zosimos's book, that's on the level of "terribly unforgivable" and should be used for insignificant supporting characters... at best!
Fake Playwright: Instead of leaving a few stand-ins for actors which just stand there chatting loudly all day, it's better to just leave them out completely!
Fake Playwright: Doing that... it only interferes with the audience's imagination, yet fails to fully convey the scene...
Fake Playwright: It's safer to avoid limiting the audience's imagination, and use words alone to lead them through it!
Fake Playwright: ...
Fake Playwright: (Fake Playwright seems to be seriously gesturing and acting out something, but the speaker remains silent.)
Fake Playwright: Ugh! I just don't have the words yet, so many lines haven't been recorded, I can't say them...
Paimon: Fake Playwright seems to be very principled... As soon as we brought up this subject, it just can't stop talking.
Traveler: High standards for oneself are a good thing.
Paimon: Anyway, let's stop for now. Otherwise, this might go on forever...
Fake Playwright: But perhaps it may not be that difficult for the two of you.
Paimon: That's true! If you think about it, you shouldn't be afraid of creating something just because someone might be harsh on it.
Paimon: #Hehe! Looks like Traveler and Paimon are talented at this too... Or Paimon should say that we're made of the right stuff, though we haven't really started!
Paimon: Anyway, you talking about this made Paimon curious about something. Did Zosimos actually read that book?
Traveler: It's better than not seeking to improve.
Traveler: Even Paimon can do it!
Traveler: That's terrible...
Traveler: How abstract.
Traveler: Are you referring to impactful dialogue?
Traveler: O Cultured Playwright, can we have a word?
Fake Playwright: I told you, I'm just one of the staff. It's like you're mocking me when you address me like that...
Paimon: #Hey! Aren't you being a little too sensitive? That's not what Traveler meant! He is always sincere!
Fake Playwright: Forgive me, being sensitive is something that comes naturally to us artistically gifted playwrights...
Fake Playwright: According to Mr. Zosimos, sometimes people in the industry have been misunderstood or even ruthlessly attacked because they were careless with their wording...
Fake Playwright: While such a demanding audience may not appear in the Veluriyam Mirage...
Fake Playwright: Mr. Zosimos also said that whenever we create something, we must be prepared to receive the attention of a larger audience and never leave it up to luck!
Fake Playwright: Hmm, we may have gone off topic a bit. Though those are more my own personal expectations, you could also consider them suggestions.
Paimon: Those expectations are way too strict! Are you going to quibble over every single little word?
Paimon: So if we create a show based on our own experiences, like the story of the Anemo Archon and Dvalin...
Paimon: Would people come forward just to fuss over things like... Hmm, something like "How disrespectful! How dare you make the Anemo Archon seem so carefree! That's far too presumptuous!"
Traveler: Just laugh it off.
Fake Playwright: What? You've ascended to the plane of "transcendence" before you've written a single script!?
Paimon: ?
Traveler: ?
Fake Playwright: One of Mr. Zosimos's books mentioned such a concept—
Fake Playwright: "Even if we exercise the utmost care while writing a script, we are bound to encounter many who we would consider are criticizing our work excessively."
Fake Playwright: "If you fear such criticism and dare not fully exercise your creative freedom, then you are putting the cart before the horse..."
Fake Playwright: In short, listen to what is right and ignore the harsh criticism.
Fake Playwright: Such transcendence is of great benefit to writing scripts. It's a realm that all playwrights dream of... It is easy to say such things, but actually doing so is a completely different story.
Traveler: Creative art should be fun, not overly cautious.
Traveler: We're here to provide material for you...
Paimon: Daiya's voice said that we should talk to you and tell interesting stories that will help with your script writing!
Fake Playwright: Oh... So Chief Director heard about your adventures from Idyia. Yes, your assistance is necessary...
Fake Playwright: But as you can see, the process of writing a script is very long. I'm worried that your stories will be so rich and detailed that I will fail to remember them after a time.
Fake Playwright: Please use the device in front of me to make a recording. That way I can review it whenever I want!
Paimon: #We're experts at that! Traveler, Paimon will allow you to decide what kind of material we should provide to Daiya's Three-Day Reverie!
Black Screen Text: After a short discussion with Paimon, you select some of the most outlandish things you've encountered in your journey and the stories from several novels before recording them in a concise and easy-to-understand tone for Fake Playwright...
Fake Playwright: Wow! That's such a long recording! This is more material than I ever expected!
Fake Playwright: I shall specially write a line to extol the great deed you have performed here today in sharing your stories!
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon wonders what kind of show this super professional Water Droplet will turn our stories into!
Paimon: Paimon can't wait!
Traveler: Don't mention it. We won't take more of your time.
Paimon: Right! We're only here to observe! We'll leave you to it then!
Fake Playwright: You're so polite and careful with your words! I hope you have a pleasant visit!

### Additional Talk 2

Engineer: *panting* You two sure are full of energy. Unfortunately, I don't have time to entertain you...
Traveler: How did you get so exhausted?
Paimon: That panting sounds so realistic! It's Paimon's first time hearing a Water Droplet sound tired. Paimon never realized this is what a worn-out Water Droplet would be like...
Engineer: Well, guess it can't be helped. That's what you call an "occupational hazard."
Paimon: Technical maintenance? Quite the specialized term to pop out of nowhere...
Traveler: What does it refer to?
Engineer: Oh! It's too complicated. I doubt I'd ever finish, so let me give you a quick rundown instead.
Engineer: This broadcasting device before you is something Idyia made for Zosimos. I heard it was made based on some new research out of the Akademiya...
Engineer: However, due to some design flaws, it works very well at times, but it often has serious bugs and can be quite troublesome.
Engineer: We Hydro Eidolons are incapable of speech, so we rely on prerecorded voice lines to converse with you.
Engineer: All the narration used in the show is prerecorded as well. I'm sure you understand why.
Paimon: Yeah, we understand the concept, but all of you still react very naturally! Speaking with you often feels as smooth as speaking to a normal person!
Engineer: That's because Idyia did everything she could to find us a lot of audio materials, and she broke apart the recordings so each word could be broadcast and used independently, or in any order.
Engineer: Thus, we gained the ability to use this device to form sentences from individual prerecorded words and respond to you.
Engineer: Of course, we have prerecorded answers for certain questions.
Engineer: "Predict potential questions and prepare answers in advance for a smooth conversation..." That's what Fake Playwright practices in its free time. You could say it is its hobby.
Engineer: Fake Playwright felt it would help with its writing, but it later realized that it wasn't the issue, but that's another topic completely.
Paimon: Whoa! So some things you say are made on the spot? You must have prepared so many voice lines...
Paimon: And if you lack a recording for a certain word, you have to find a way to work around it.
Engineer: Indeed, you've discovered the critical issue! This broadcasting device requires too many voice samples, and I'm in charge of maintaining everything.
Engineer: And everyone has been developing unique personalities lately, so even more voice line updates are necessary. I simply can't keep up with it all...
Paimon: Really? You sound way overworked!
Traveler: That kind of workload is horrifying.
Engineer: Just this alone isn't too much work for me. The problem is I have to maintain all the other equipment and mechanisms, like the device for the sea monster's minions you saw...
Engineer: Just getting to the set of each play takes so much time, and yet I still have to repair everything that broke...
Engineer: It's all Zosimos's fault! He's the worst! Just because I showed the tiniest bit of interest in the equipment, he trained me to be the one and only maintenance guy!
Engineer: Why couldn't he have gotten a few more Hydro Eidolons? No matter how fond you are of something, you'll get tired of it when you have to do it all day every day.
Paimon: C-Calm down, don't be sad! Cheer up!
Paimon: Maybe your troupe will recruit other Water Droplets, and once you have more members, they'll be able to take some work off your hands!
Engineer: I hope so... but I wonder when we'll be able to find any qualified new members.
Engineer: I should go ask Idyia when I get the chance...
Traveler: You deserve a massive raise and a bonus!
Traveler: Could you elaborate?
Traveler: Please take some rest!
Engineer: I appreciate the concern. I'll take a break once I'm done here... But will there ever come a day when my work is truly done...?

### Additional Talk 3

Loafer: Oho! Two special guests! Is there anything I can do for you? I'm Loafer, and I specialize in the lowest-effort solutions...
Traveler: Are you... especially fond of loafing around?
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon would like to know too!
Paimon: Did you get that name because you never do any work?
Loafer: Heh! It's not like that! Whether it's controlling the play's progress or making the necessary props and scene elements, I've always completed my work on time!
Loafer: Loafing is a state of mind. It strives to achieve the most with the least effort.
Loafer: For example, instead of making something three-dimensional, only the front and back of a scene element is prepared. So, uh... In the words of Chief Director, it saves us a lot of time!
Paimon: ?
Traveler: ?
Paimon: Doesn't that mean it has no sides?
Loafer: Isn't tricking the audience's eyes all we need to do?
Loafer: For example, slowing down the Choo-Choo Cart right in front of a scene element, and then shooting off right when it's about to move past it.
Loafer: Doing that will keep most of the audience's focus on the front of the scene element! Think about, didn't you do the same with the sea monster's minions?
Loafer: Otherwise, our troupe wouldn't have time to complete the more important scenes.
Loafer: Instead of wasting time focusing on the "sides of the sea monster's minions," the completeness of the entire experience is definitely more important.
Paimon: That does make sense...
Paimon: From what you said... calling you "Loafer" is a kind of compliment?
Traveler: That kinda makes sense.
Loafer: Free your minds, honored guests!
Loafer: If you are like that fool Zosimos and fail to understand the importance of saving time and effort where you can, you shouldn't bother with working at all!
Loafer: After all, if you seek perfection in every detail, the work will be endless! If you allow insignificant details to affect the main performance, you'll be killing the goose that lays the golden egg!
Loafer: Of course, all of this is based on the premise that there is a serious shortage of personnel.
Loafer: If we were to continue using such methods with sufficient staffing, then instead of loafing, we would just be good for nothing trash!
Loafer: At times like that, we should make fundamentals beyond reproach, then strive for perfection in every detail while still utilizing this philosophy to make the whole show even more impeccable.
Paimon: You've almost convinced Paimon! Paimon'll definitely give it some more thought.
Traveler: But it also sounds like a load of baloney.
Traveler: Then we'll leave you to your loafing.
Loafer: Thank you so much! Your wisdom lights up my day! Come again when you're free!

### Additional Talk 4

Hustler: Work! Work! Work! Sprint to the finish! Go above and beyond the call of duty, win early!
Traveler: Take it easy over there...
Hustler: When one task is done, I can start another! I will go wherever the need is greatest!
Paimon: It's just a little Water Droplet, but it's got such a scary aura...
Paimon: It seems absolutely in love with working. Just getting close to it feels like Paimon will be dragged along to work with it... forever...
Hustler: Huh? Did I just hear you talking about me?
Paimon: No, we never did anything of the sort! We're busy people too, so we'll be on our way...
Hustler: Oooooh! Busy? You're really busy? How about you give some of your work to me?
Paimon: ?
Traveler: ?
Hustler: I'll take any job! Anything! And I can learn if I lack the know-how! I love challenging new jobs!
Paimon: Did we misunderstand this Water Droplet? Instead of dragging others along to suffer with it, it actually does their work for them?
Paimon: Um... So, Water Droplet, what work do you usually do?
Hustler: Let me think... I don't think I have any fixed responsibilities.
Hustler: Chief Director asks for my help with controlling the show's mechanisms, Fake Playwright makes me run errands and carry reference books for the script writing...
Hustler: Engineer sends me to clean the rails, and Loafer has asked for my help making props.
Traveler: Sounds like you're a master of all trades!
Hustler: Whatever you call it, I'm fond of using diverse, new, and high-intensity jobs to hone my abilities in all aspects.
Hustler: In this way, I can obtain an in-depth understanding of every aspect of a show and do them all well to surpass Zosimos, who only knows how to talk a big game...
Paimon: Paimon wonders if Zosimos has led this Water Droplet astray...
Paimon: But given how passionate it is, maybe it'll get mad if we mention the past? We should avoid asking about that for now...
Hustler: Anyways, both of you are important guests to the entire attraction. Can I help you with anything?
Paimon: #Oh! Traveler and Paimon are still... preparing to enter the industry! We don't need your help for now!
Hustler: Understood. Then I'll be going back to work!
Hustler: Good luck! I hope you'll one day bless me with an unending stream of diverse work!
Traveler: Sounds like an intern.
Traveler: (Glance at Paimon and hope she gets the hint to leave quietly.)
Paimon: Alright... Paimon's kinda curious about what it's working on, but let's not disturb it...

### Additional Talk 5

Harum-Scarum: (It seems to be the Hydro Eidolon from before that was operating some mechanisms according to the Chief Director's instructions.)
Harum-Scarum: (But without a console of its own, it is incapable of speaking. It just constantly trembles with fear as if it has done something wrong...)

### Additional Talk 6

Food Manager: (A Hydro Eidolon that seems to be up to something in the corner. According to Chief Director, its nickname is "Food Manager.")
Food Manager: (But... isn't that a bit strange? What do Hydro Eidolons even eat? Or maybe... it's responsible for feeding those ghost mechanisms?)
