## Talk

Traveler: About those unsettling omens I keep seeing...
Grace: No matter what the cause may be, all we can do is pray.
Grace: I had some adventurers help me collect some Cecilia buds to give everyone...
Grace: These flowers grow on top of cliffs, whisked by the Mondstadt winds...
Grace: Perhaps these flowers that emanate the essence of Barbatos can bring some peace of mind to everyone.
Grace: Here, please take some. May Barbatos shine upon Mondstadt.

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Grace: I fear that this is one of the causes for the unease in everyone's hearts...
Grace: I am not a Knight of Favonius, and so, I can only pray to the winds.
Grace: Oh, Lord Barbatos, defend the people of Mondstadt.

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Grace: Lord Barbatos has indeed heard our prayers. Mondstadt is safe once again.
Grace: Although I say that it is over, Dvalin's influence will likely remain for a while longer...
Grace: But I believe that as long as the winds of Mondstadt persist, Lord Barbatos will always be with us.
Grace: ...Perhaps he is already amongst us. Who can say?
