Traveler: However...?
Rie: Ah, don't get me wrong. Hanamizaka is also a fine place to check out. You can go to Yae Publishing House to buy a novel, have a fine meal at Kiminami Restaurant... That would already make for a leisurely day indeed.
Rie: However, I heard rumors that there was a weirdo with a pair of long horns frequenting Hanamizaka...
Rie: I've heard that this man is very mean and overbearing, so much so that even Madam Kujou Sara from the Tenryou Commission considers him a headache.
Rie: But I've also heard it said that this weird man is not a thug. He just hangs out with the children all day, playing card games or setting up a bug-fighting arena...
Rie: I'm not sure if I should buy into any of these rumors... Anyway, if you happen to find yourself there, it's best to be a bit more careful.
