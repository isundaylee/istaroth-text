Traveler: I'm afraid I'm no longer a rookie.
Furuya Noboru: Wow, such forcefulness! It seems that I have judged a book by its cover. My apologies.
Furuya Noboru: But since you have just arrived in Inazuma, you probably still find many things unfamiliar. If you run into any trouble, be careful. Come look for me!
Furuya Noboru: Still, I expect that there'll be competition for all the buried treasure soon, what with the number of adventurers we're expecting to arrive at our shores from overseas soon.
Furuya Noboru: If you have confidence in your abilities, this might be the right place for you to flex your muscles.
Furuya Noboru: *cough* Anyway, best you be careful when going outside. The Adventurers' Guild will always be behind you.
