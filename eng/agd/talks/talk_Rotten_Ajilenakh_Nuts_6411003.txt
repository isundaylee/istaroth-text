Traveler: Rotten Ajilenakh Nuts...
Feroz: You heard that? Don't worry about it. I wasn't talking about you.
Feroz: I was talking about the hateful smugglers and those rattling about "resurrecting King Deshret." Dimwits!
Feroz: Like Ajilenakh Nuts rotting in the sand, they are sticky and annoying.
Feroz: It would be a relief to all of us if the stupid Akademiya were to take them down!
Feroz: Bringing this up with the Navbed is no use, they just beat around the bush.
Feroz: It seems that wine is the only thing they wouldn't skirt around!
