Traveler: What type of flowers are these?
Madame Ping: These are Glaze Lilies. Probably the last surviving ones in all of Liyue Harbor.
Madame Ping: People say that the sound of singing nourishes them, and helps them grow...
Madame Ping: But the sound of fighting, of cursing... it is poison to them, and eats away at their roots.
Madame Ping: That is why, over centuries of strife, they have disappeared from Liyue's landscape.
