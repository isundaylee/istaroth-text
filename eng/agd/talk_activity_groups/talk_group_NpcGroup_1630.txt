Olaf: Life in the future is hard to get used to...

Traveler: How do you get on with your modern family?
Olaf: Well, I have skipped over so many centuries that try as we might, Draff and I cannot figure out where exactly I fit in the family tree, and therefore how we should address one another.
Olaf: So we just gave up and started using first names instead. You have got to overlook some things when you are in a strange situation like this, do you not think?
Olaf: Being related by blood does seem to give us an inexplicable connection though. Draff and I are complete strangers, and yet we keep finding that we just have so much in common.
Olaf: ...Especially when it comes to drinking. It comforts me to know that hundreds of years on, Mondstadt still has such excellent taste in alcohol.
Olaf: But every time we start talking about it, his little girl Diona gives me this dirty look that really makes her great-great-great... I don't know how many greats it is but anyway, it really makes her Granddad of indeterminate great-hood feel... greatly aggrieved.

Traveler: What was Springvale like in your day?
Olaf: You mean, the age I lived in before my accidental cryopreservation?
Olaf: This spring was formed from melted snow and ice that came down from Dragonspine. I heard that Springvale originally began as just a group of hunters like me who settled in this area because of the water source.
Olaf: Over time, it gradually grew to the size of a small town. I certainly do not believe this nonsense you future folk trot out about some fountain fairy.

Traveler: Goodbye.
Olaf: Back to the hunt for you, is it? May it be a fruitful one.
