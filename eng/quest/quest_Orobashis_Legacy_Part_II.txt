Paimon: This stone lantern is so creepy... It feels familiar.
Paimon: Oh, someone's written something on the lantern post!

Observe: The handwriting looks new, yet eroded by rain. A few clear lines of smaller writings are below.
Observe: "Please don't believe these strange notes. We've got no time to lose! This must an enemy trick meant to slow us down."
Observe: "Whoever leaves the team without permission will be severely punished!"
Paimon: This Mr. Kaji seems to be pretty concerned about these stone lanterns. Why don't we go to Musoujin Gorge and ask him?
