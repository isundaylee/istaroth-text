# Talk Dialog

Helka: Ready to rumble with the giant ball of water?
Traveler: I'll get prepping now.
Traveler: Let's talk a bit first...
Helka: So, the will of water can also manifest itself in such a form... Inconceivable. It really doesn't look as though it lacks a soul.
Helka: Katya once told me a story about a fisherman who fell in love with a spirit of pure water, but such entities have no souls, and thus the fisherman set out on a journey to discard his as well...
Traveler: Could you tell me a bit about Katya?
Helka: She used to be a great adventurer back in the day, and her exploits took her all over the world. Eventually, her injuries led to her retirement, after which she settled down in Nasha Town.
Helka: She's always taken good care of us, and gave me lots of practical advice before I set out... I have immense respect for her, and am also immensely grateful to her.
Helka: Oh, right! If you get the chance, you should definitely try her cooking!
Traveler: Give me a moment.
