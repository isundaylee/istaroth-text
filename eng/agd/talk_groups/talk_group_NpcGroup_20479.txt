Ooshima (???): Forget the book, forget whether we were falsely accused or not. Go find Antei!
Paimon: Antei?
Ooshima: Yes, he's the third guy who was locked up together with us. I'm Ooshima, and as for that guy, his name's Antigonus, or Antei, if you want the Narukami Island-ized version.
Ooshima: He was an apprentice Jibashiri as well. Fierce temper, and super strong to boot. He escaped by grabbing the tiny bumps in the cliff and climbing right out of here.
Ooshima: That's just horrifying. Is that even possible for normal people?
Traveler: Actually, I can do that too.
Ooshima: Ugh, forget it. You people who volunteer to become Jibashiri, I bet you've trained so hard that you've ceased to be human anymore.
Ooshima: I've heard that the test to become a Jibashiri involves the candidate lifting one foot with both hands and standing in a circle.
Ooshima: Then they get 12 other Jibashiri to stab at them with spears, and if they can go an entire night without being injured, they pass.
Ooshima: I mean, you're a Jibashiri candidate. Is that rumor true?
Traveler: Not as far as I know...
Ooshima: Seriously? Are you telling me that it's even worse?
Ooshima: C'mon, tell me!
Traveler: Isn't the issue with Antei more important?
Ooshima: Oh... Right. Yeah. *cough*
Ooshima: He said that he would leave us a picture of a "byrde" as a sign to mark his path.
Ooshima: It's an animal you can't find here in Enkanomiya. It can fly, it has wings, and it symbolizes freedom. Or something.
Paimon: Isn't that a "bird"?
Ooshima: Right. That's right. "Bird."
Ooshima: He told me his plan was to climb up, retrieve a set of official-issue exploration gear that he'd hidden there beforehand, and then set off in the direction of the Serpent's Heart. Said he was following some leads about a delegation from Khaenri'ah.
Ooshima: He said that he'd prove our innocence, even if that was the last thing he did, and that if any officials or shrine maidens came to look for us, we should tell them that he was headed for the Serpent's Heart.
Ooshima: So yeah, even if he doesn't make it, he'll leave a bird picture behind as a clue to lead people to the proof that we're innocent.
Ooshima: As long as nothing goes wrong, you should be able to find him by following the bird pictures.
Ooshima: Our lives are at stake here, so please, go!

Ooshima: Go look for Antei and bring him back here, then get us all out â€” legally, of course.
