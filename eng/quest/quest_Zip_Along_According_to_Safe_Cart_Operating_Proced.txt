# Zip Along (According to Safe Cart Operating Procedures)


## Talk 1

Ferdinand: Ah, so the Hydro Eidolon was locked up in that chest.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Aw, it's completely empty.

## Talk 3

Klee: Weee! Look, Klee can fly just like Paimon now!
Paimon: This is way more exciting than how Paimon usually flies!

## Talk 4

Ferdinand: Sometimes I can't help but get angry just thinking of Jeroney. You should have seen him back in the sandstorm. I suggested we go east, and he argued that we should go west...
Paimon: You were in sandstorm!? What happened after that?
Ferdinand: We separated and each went our own way...
Ferdinand: Lucky for us, we stumbled across this domain, otherwise I'm sure we would have been buried in the sand.

## Talk 5

Haddo: Good, Torrential Twister is ready to run now. Let's go to the station at the start of the track.

## Talk 6

Klee: Woo-hoooo! Weeeee!!!
Paimon: Looks like Klee's having the most fun.

## Talk 7

Klee: Missing text (4216695402)

## Talk 8

Klee: That's so much fun! Klee can fly across the sky like a real mage now!
Paimon: Uh... Guess that... sort of makes sense?
Paimon: Wait â€” but if being able to fly makes you a mage, what does that make Kaeya? Since he's here too...
Klee: Nothing, Kaeya's just the Master Thief. Don't you remember, Paimon?
Paimon: ...
Paimon: Oh right... Guess it slipped Paimon's mind.
Kaeya: Sorry to bother our young Mage, but there's something the Master Thief would like to report. Do you still remember our mission?
Klee: Uh-oh!
Klee: I was having so much fun that I almost forgot...
Kaeya: We're supposed to be helping Idyia look for the missing components. But don't worry, I've already got one.
Klee: You mean you snatched it when we weren't looking?
Kaeya: Haha, I didn't have to go that far.
Kaeya: In fact, the component we were searching for was actually that orange rope. If anything, you could say it came right into our hands at the right time. Let's head back and give it to Idyia.
Klee: Aww, do we really have to go...?
Klee: Okay... Even though I want to keep playing, I know Idyia is really important!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: That's our wise mage... Don't worry, tonight you'll be able to see stars in the water and watch fish dance in the sky.
Paimon: Uh, seems Kokomi's out of it after that ride... Her face is completely blank, and her lip was trembling while she was speaking. Maybe we should have a rest for a while.
Traveler: You shouldn't push yourself.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ah? I thought I was keeping my composure pretty well...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Don't worry, my mind is always spinning, I'm used to this! We should head back to Idyia.
Klee: How about we hold hands, Miss General? Klee will give you energy!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: (Huh, after holding Klee's hand, the stars in the sky and the fish in the water have all disappeared. I must have been seeing things from riding in the cart... Whew.)
Paimon: Hmm? What are you smiling about, Kokomi?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Huh? Oh, ah... Ahem, nothing... nothing at all.
Traveler: We're in no rush.

## Talk 9

Idyia: Welcome back! Well? Any good news? Ah! Don't tell me! You've taken care of all the problems and now I don't have to do anything!?
Traveler: You won't be disappointed.
Klee: Yeah, we even rode the Choo-Choo Cart! Do you wanna come ride too?
Klee: Uh, but maybe you'll have to wait till tomorrow. I'm a little tired now...
Kaeya: Seems she had a little too much fun and now she's about to crash. Haha, I think it's time for a rest.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Good idea, I think we could all use some down time. Thanks for giving me some energy, Klee.
Kaeya: Then we'll see you later.
Traveler: Bye, Klee.
Klee: #Bye, {M#Mr.}{F#Miss} Honorary Knight! Bye, everyone!
Idyia: Well, it sounds like our young mage enjoyed herself. I'm happy that she had a good time.
Idyia: So, back to the missing component. Did you bring it?
Paimon: You bet! Kaeya said that the missing component was this orange climbing rope.
Idyia: Ah, it just occurred to me that you probably ran into the three brothers while you were in the canyon.
Idyia: If I remember correctly, the two eldest brothers were taking their sickly younger brother on adventures, when they ran into a sandstorm and ended up here.
Idyia: They were all arguing with one other when they first arrived, but it wasn't long before they broke down and were huddled together in tears.
Idyia: *sigh* They sure must have a lot of energy to keep up their bickering and adventuring every day. I'm a little worried about them, yet quite envious of all that energy...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: You almost sound as if you're reminiscing about old friends, Idyia.
Idyia: Yes, I've known them for quite some time, after all... But I seldom go to that area.
Idyia: #You can hold on to the rope for now, {NICKNAME}. I have no use for it until we have the other components.
Idyia: By the way, Eula and Collei have also returned, but I'm afraid they weren't able to make much headway.
Idyia: They mentioned that they would like to head to the jungle north of here once you have all rested up.
Traveler: Understood.
Idyia: Now that I've told you everything, I'll go rest... Uh, I mean, I'll go and check on the situation in the remaining two areas.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Do you need me to accompany you?
Idyia: Oh! No, it's alright. You've already accomplished a lot today, you should rest up.
Traveler: Yep, we took care of everything.

Ferdinand: Be sure to come back and visit Torrential Twister again... I hope you enjoyed it!

Jeroney: Thanks again. I have a feeling we'll get along much better now that we've learned to open up to each other.
Jeroney: I suppose some things are simpler than they appear... The real problem all along was actually us.

Haddo: Hey, imagine if we could build our tracks all over the world. Traveling would be so much easier! *cough*
