# Cake for Traveler

A gift given to a very special someone on a very special day.

Here's to you, the symphony and echoes amidst the verdant trees.
May you find happiness and peace in your sweet dreams.

"Recommended dishes will be updated on a weekly basis, and the moon will shower us with new blessings each month, but wow, it'll be almost nine thousand hours before we can celebrate this day again! Hee-hee, let Paimon play you the music from that score on top of the cake. You'd better not make fun of Paimon's performance, cus she's been practicing it for ages!"
