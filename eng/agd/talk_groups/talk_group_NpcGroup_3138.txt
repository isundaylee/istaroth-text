Traveler: Are you hurt?
Raku: Well, what do you think? It was a pretty serious injury, too. It still hurts even now...
Raku: Hey, hey, stop peeking. My old wound looks awful. Why, the very sight of it might shock and disturb you... I'd advise against it.
Raku: Ow ow ow, that... really hurts.

Traveler: I can bring you to see a doctor.
Raku: Eh? Uh... There's no need, I went to see a doctor long ago. I mean, it's a serious injury. How could I have not gone to see a doctor, huh?
Raku: The doctor said that I needed to convalesce. That I needed a, ah, quiet environment and some time.
Raku: Anyway, don't you have better things to do? You look like a busy person. I'm sure you don't have time to waste here with me!
