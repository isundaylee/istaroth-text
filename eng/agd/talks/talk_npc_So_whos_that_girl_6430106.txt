Traveler: So, who's that girl?
Amir: Oh... She's a Trainee Forest Ranger who's currently stationed with us.
Amir: She's only just recovered from a very serious illness, but it seems that she's been trying a bit too hard recently.
Amir: She's been all over the shop, so much so that I've started to worry that she might go running off into a storm again just to rescue someone.
Amir: That's why I've asked our search and rescue dogs to pay attention to her condition and notify me immediately if something happens. That's the only way that I can be there in time to help her.
