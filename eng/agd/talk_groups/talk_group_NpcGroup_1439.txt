Lawrence: Welcome to Mondstadt, traveler. How can I help you?

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Lawrence: I had no idea what to do when the incident had just happened. At least we can finally draw all this to a close.
Lawrence: Still, it's quite remarkable that we encountered such an event. Doesn't this mean that we, too, have witnessed history?
Lawrence: Well, if anyone asks me for a tale or legend in the future, I'm going to tell them the story of Dvalin.

Traveler: What do you know about the Lawrence Clan...?
Lawrence: Heh... I actually have no connection at all to the Lawrence Clan. *sigh* It's a bit of a long story...
Lawrence: You must know Wagner, the blacksmith? Well, the one other thing he enjoys besides working with metal is drinking competitions. Placing a bet and seeing who can drink the most. The drunker he gets, the more outrageous the bets become...
Lawrence: The whole reason his shop is called "Schulz's Blacksmith" is because he lost to his apprentice, Schulz, in a drinking game.
Lawrence: ...Ahem, now, my father is a merchant from Fontaine, and he came to Mondstadt to do business. Though, you'd be forgiven for thinking he came for the drinking culture alone...
Lawrence: One day, the two of them got drinking together. My father bet on his son's name — that is to say, my name, and... yeah.
Lawrence: *sigh* At that time, my father was not to know that the name "Lawrence" came with so much baggage...

Traveler: Tell me about Mondstadt.
Lawrence: Known as both "The Crown of the North" and "The City of Pastoral Song," there are no words that can truly describe the beauty of this city.
Lawrence: A new bard arrived in the city not long ago. You should seek him out if you want to feel the true essence of Mondstadt.
Lawrence: But the songs he plays are... a bit archaic?
Lawrence: ...Those songs date back thousands of years. No clue as to how he knows them...
Traveler: Are there any legends about Mondstadt?
Lawrence: You've come to the right person.
Lawrence: It's said in Mondstadt, a righteous hero often appears at night.
Lawrence: But no one knows his true identity...
Lawrence: I should stop there, or else I'll keep talking about him. If the Acting Grand Master catches me chatting on duty again...
Lawrence: Sorry, guess I'll talk to you next time.
Traveler: Are there any anecdotes about Mondstadt?
Lawrence: Anecdotes...? Not sure if this counts as one.
Lawrence: When I'm on my shift here, I'll sometimes notice the weather change very suddenly.
Lawrence: Um... Rather than a natural phenomenon, it feels more like someone is manipulating the weather. But who has that much power to do that?
Lawrence: Even the higher-ranking knights in the Knights of Favonius don't seem to have the ability to do that. How strange.

Traveler: So, what was the outcome?
Lawrence: The outcome... well, as you can attest to, every few days, I get someone coming up to me and asking what my connection with the Lawrence Clan is.
Lawrence: My father gets extremely remorseful about the whole thing every time I bring it up...
Lawrence: ...Mostly because if he'd just managed to get one more drink down him, Wagner would have had to name his most prized weapon "Pinky the Rabbit"... *sigh* ...
