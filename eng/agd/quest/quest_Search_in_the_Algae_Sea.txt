# Search in the Algae Sea


## Talk 1

Paimon: #Let's come back in a few days, Traveler.
Paimon: Give them some time to sort both their bodies and memories out...
Paimon: Whether it's Seymour's fragmented information, or Ann and Caterpillar... This is something only they can do for themselves.

## Talk 2

Unknown Role (None): Chicken-Mushroom Skewer. At the risk of missing major plot twists or important foreshadowing, I don't think this is related to Ann's background either...
Unknown Role (None): Oceanids are sentient creatures unique to Fontaine, and they can create Oceanid creatures through mimicry and transformation.
Unknown Role (None): I remember all the strange and wonderful Oceanid creatures we saw before we met "Mary-Ann."
Unknown Role (None): Ann said the name sounded familiar. I should ask her about it should something come to mind.
Unknown Role (None): To Seymour, she is someone that he must protect.
Unknown Role (None): Either way, ordinary humans don't live that long. It's been several hundred years, so they're probably not the same person, right?
Unknown Role (None): Ann is a small Oceanid. She didn't create the Oceanid creatures in Annapausis.
Unknown Role (None): Speaking of... Just how do Oceanids reproduce again?
Unknown Role (None): Maybe Osial can create water creatures, but it's extraordinary to be able to imagine creatures with rich personalities.
Unknown Role (None): It's almost certain that there's an Oceanid in Annapausis controlling everything.
Unknown Role (None): Who can she be?
Unknown Role (None): The "Mary-Ann" in Annapausis seems very mysterious. We once suspected that Ann was a character from her dreams.
Unknown Role (None): Ann's far too weak to control that whole realm, so she can't be the Oceanid behind it all.
Unknown Role (None): It's definitely not Ann. I believe her, she is also searching for answers.
Unknown Role (None): Mary-Ann, who has the same name as Seymour's owner, and who seems to know everything.
Unknown Role (None): Even if she's not an Oceanid, she's probably related to the Oceanid behind all of this.
Unknown Role (None): Lyris isn't exactly the brightest Oceanid. She has lacks both the requisite power and madness to create Ann the Oceanid.
Unknown Role (None): A war took place inside Elynas, and many animals of steel and flesh died.
Unknown Role (None): Seymour was damaged there and has been in the care of Mamere ever since.
Unknown Role (None): Seymour's primary instruction is to protect "Mary-Ann."
Unknown Role (None): We just confirmed that there is an Oceanid in Annapausis controlling everything.
Unknown Role (None): Ann recalled a story, but we couldn't use its symbolism or metaphors as clues.
Unknown Role (None): But she does have memories that don't belong to her. How?
Unknown Role (None): If Seymour was damaged in Elynas, that means it likely failed in its mission, and the person that it was supposed to protect may have already...
Unknown Role (None): If Seymour failed, then perhaps that means Mary-Ann met with an unexpected misfortune during the conflict...
Unknown Role (None): The person Seymour was supposed to protect was Mary-Ann Guillotin.
Unknown Role (None): This question must be answered eventually
Unknown Role (None): Where did Ann's memories of fairy tales come from?
Unknown Role (None): We can't just enumerate the possibilities and say it's Lyris and Mary-Ann Guillotin. That's disrespectful to Ann.
Unknown Role (None): But the Red Empress does appear in the fairy tales, and that's an element directly from the Narzissenkreuz Ordo.
Unknown Role (None): Ignoring questions about lifespan and how long it's been, what happened to Mary-Ann Guillotin after Seymour failed?
Unknown Role (None): The "Red Empress" is what the Narzissenkreuz Ordo called Lyris.
Unknown Role (None): She is the only other Oceanid involved in this whole affair.
Unknown Role (None): But she is not powerful enough to have possibly created Ann.
Unknown Role (None): The intel we received said she was intellectually challenged, yet the "Mary-Ann" we saw seemed quite normal.
Unknown Role (None): Can a kitten understand a little girl's thinking and behavior, and then have a vivid, life-like dream of its master? Probably not.
Unknown Role (None): We can speculate all we want, but we'll have to find Mary-Ann to find the truth.
Unknown Role (None): Though I've got some vague ideas to go on, there are still things that I cannot convince myself of.
Unknown Role (None): I have to go see Mary-Ann in Annapausis to find more leads.
Unknown Role (None): I don't know why I can't get this out of my mind.
Unknown Role (None): This can't really be foreshadowing, can it?
Unknown Role (None): A member of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo from several hundred years ago.
Unknown Role (None): Her whereabouts afterward are unknown.
Unknown Role (None): She is also the only other Oceanid involved other than Ann.
Unknown Role (None): "Mary-Ann," who wove a fairy tale without an ending...
Unknown Role (None): She refused our visit, but she mentioned her memories from the Narzissenkreuz Institute.
Unknown Role (None): It sounded like she was waiting for everyone to return to the Institute ruins.
Unknown Role (None): The one that Seymour was supposed to protect.
Unknown Role (None): Something happened in Elynas, resulting in Seymour's damage and her disappearance.
Unknown Role (None): Where is she, and what is her relationship with "Mary-Ann"?
Unknown Role (None): The only person who grew up in the Narzissenkreuz Institute and has a matching background is Mary-Ann Guillotin.
Unknown Role (None): The person who once waited within the deserted ruins for everyone's return was Lyris, the former director.
Unknown Role (None): "Mary-Ann" has Lyris's memories.
Unknown Role (None): "Mary-Ann" has Mary-Ann Guillotin's memories.
Unknown Role (None): If so, then "Mary-Ann" is Lyris. Another piece of evidence we have is that they can both use Oceanid powers to control Annapausis.
Unknown Role (None): If so, then "Mary-Ann" is Mary-Ann Guillotin. They have the same name and matching memories.
Unknown Role (None): But how can she be both people at the same time?
Unknown Role (None): This must mean that Lyris, an Oceanid, probably has special powers.
Unknown Role (None): Her job in the Ordo was to dissolve the members' egos. What could have happened between her and the missing Mary-Ann Guillotin...
Unknown Role (None): For some reason, Lyris dissolved Mary-Ann Guillotin's personality.
Unknown Role (None): And afterward, their wills, now mixed, began to dream.
Unknown Role (None): They dreamed of a simple world, where the princess is saved and the evil dragon gets killed, while the heroes are always pressing onward.
Unknown Role (None): They dreamed of a world where everything was simple and had an answer, as long as Ann was there.
Unknown Role (None): Thus, Ann and "Mary-Ann" were born.

## Talk 3

Caterpillar: So, could you tell us what you heard?
Caterpillar: Perhaps a hilichurl might hear something that humans and Oceanids will not, just as how dogs and humans differ in that regard.
Seymour: I must correct your statement. My auditory components can indeed pick up higher and lower frequencies as compared to humans. However, I am not a dog. Moreover, a dog's low-frequency hearing is similar to that of a human.
Caterpillar: Is that so? Well, I was talking about real dogs, not you, 4ACV07.
Ann: Haha, silly dog!
Ann: #That said, I didn't think you would hear it too, Knight Traveler. I wonder if we'd heard the same thing.
Traveler: "But everyone's left..."
Ann: "They won't come back, no matter how long I wait..."
Ann: Looks like we heard the same thing. I suspect that this was the inner voice of "Mary-Ann."
Caterpillar: #Did she say anything else? I'm not trying to invade anyone's privacy or anything. I just think that we're onto something here with you mentioning these words, Traveler.
Ann: Let me think... After that, I also heard something like "I prefer the story of the Narzissenkreuz Adventure Team sitting down happily for tea time after their adventure has ended."
Ann: And then...
Ann: "I don't want to hear your stories... I prefer my version."
Caterpillar: #...Have you noticed something off about this, Traveler?
Seymour: Please state your case.
Caterpillar: Let's think our own thoughts through first. Perhaps we really might be able to come to some conclusion.

## Talk 4

Ann: We're back again. This time, I must... Mary-Ann...
Caterpillar: That's the spirit, Ms. Ann.
Caterpillar: In truth, I must confess to being somewhat jealous of you.
Ann: Hmm?
Caterpillar: You still hold out hope of recovering your past. I've... been searching for centuries, but I haven't found a thing.
Caterpillar: So please, do your best for this old caterpillar's part as well, alright? Figure your past out, and come to accept your present self.
Ann: Yup, I will!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Huh. The bubble that was here before is gone, too.
Ann: Well, it was Princess Lyris's magic... That's just how the story goes.
Caterpillar: Let me think of a way.
Caterpillar: Close your eyes, everyone.
Seymour: A temporary optical sensor shutdown? Understood. They will be reactivated on your command.
Paimon: Wait, why do we have to do that?
Caterpillar: The essence of a mime is pretense — the charade that something is still here.
Caterpillar: And belief is the heart of magic, the faith that there is meaning here... so, let's close our eyes.
Caterpillar: So, Ann, begin imagining what it would look like if that bubble was still here.
Black Screen Text: You close your eyes, and feel some sort of fluctuation...
Black Screen Text: "I prefer the story of the Narzissenkreuz Adventure Team sitting down happily for tea time after their adventure has ended."
Paimon: Wow, it really appeared!
Caterpillar: The Ordo called this step, the process of imagining something in such detail, "imaging."
Paimon: Let's go over and have a look.

## Talk 6

Jakob: Ha... Ha... It's been a while, "chrysalis." Still no sign of metamorphosis, I see.
Jakob: Perhaps you've grown too used to being a caterpillar?
Jakob: Have you already forgotten the time we spent here?
Jakob: It was a brief time compared to our eternity. But those brief moments granted us mastery of this universe.
Caterpillar: I was nothing more than your "exhibit" at that time, nor could I understand your grand plans. Plus, I tend to have a bad memory for things I don't like.
Caterpillar: But on your return, you performed the "Dispelling Ritual." How fastidious of you.
Jakob: Of course. How could I allow spiritual impurities or contaminants into the Master's space?
Jakob: Alas, you have not yet left your cocoon. You will return to the void in the end. There is no place for you in the new world.
Traveler: Hand over the rest of it.
Jakob: Hmph. I shall permit it. It seems it is you who are the hero wielding the Holy Blade in this telling of the story, while I am the dragon who falls to your sword.
Jakob: It matters not in the end. All the elements are in place and the dragon has been defeated. You may guard "reason" — for now.
Jakob: After all, nobody can truly own the Holy Blade. We merely hold it as it travels in the direction it must, until it reaches its final destiny.
Caterpillar: The Holy Blade can be any object. But there is particular symbolism in it being a sword.
Caterpillar: Well then, present something that can hold "reason."
Paimon: Let's use the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz we found earlier.
Traveler: *nod*
Jakob: Th—This is...
Caterpillar: What's next, Jakob?
Jakob: Eh? Uh... Hm.
Caterpillar: Don't you want to reforge the Holy Blade as soon as possible?
Jakob: Next, Oceanid, you touch the sword.
Ann: ...Is this a trap?
Jakob: No. Although the Holy Blade can part any will from water, it can also unite wills. It can accommodate both the primordial, and that of order.
Jakob: You have been chosen because even if you are an illusion, you contain something that the Narzissenkreuz Ordo has gathered over many years...
Jakob: ...The power of will.
Caterpillar: Should we trust him?
Seymour: His biological indicators show a very low probability of lying, though I remain doubtful.
Jakob: How long must you dawdle? You're no better than that rusty old shell Guillotin created.
Jakob: Would you like some oil for your brain? Or rust remover?
Traveler: Speaking of rust remover...
Paimon: What about it?
Traveler: That watch...
Paimon: Yeah! We can try using rust remover on the watch!
Jakob: What nonsense are you all going on about...
Ann: Adults shouldn't interrupt children.
Jakob: ...
Caterpillar: And I'm a child, too.
Paimon: Whoa! It's open!
Paimon: And there's... a photo inside?
Jakob: Hmm. How nostalgic. Alain, Rene, Director Lyris, Mary-Ann, and myself, as we once were.
Ann: I... I remember this photo...
Ann: I think I remember...
Seymour: Matching traits detected. That is Mary-Ann, my ward.
Jakob: Well? Has the oil helped lubricate your rusty decision-making skills?
Ann: If we don't take this step, we'll never be able to leave the world of memory.
Ann: Yeah. Let me give it a try, then.
Traveler: Ann!
Ann: It's okay. I've made up my mind.
Paimon: Whoa...
Paimon: Is this what the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz is really like?
Ann: Weren't you listening? Caterpillar just explained that the Holy Blade can indwell any form that holds significance.
Jakob: Ah... Just like the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz we imagined...
Paimon: Y—You changed back!
Jakob: Ahem... Very good. My mission is complete. Now, I propose a trade.
Jakob: Now, you, Oceanid! Please take all my emotions and memories.
Ann: Huh?
Jakob: My power is no match for yours, and I will soon disappear.
Jakob: Save all that I am, that I may be reunited with everyone in the new world.
Ann: But...
Jakob: We established several nodes in Fontaine in accordance with the Seal of Chymical Marriage as part of our response to the apocalypse.
Jakob: Today, only the five most important survive. Only the smallest part of our Master's plan has been implemented, but even that is a form of success.
Jakob: The arrival of the new world is fated. I...
Ann: I cannot absorb your persona and memories. After all, I have no wish to retain anyone as with such serious sins on their hands as you are now.
Jakob: Huh?
Ann: You may no longer be the crybaby Jakob, but as you are now, you are still not worthy of eternity.
Ann: Rather than do that, we will help you and treat you. You must atone for your sins.
Jakob: Part of the Red Empress is within you, so you should know that she rejected the future.
Jakob: She wanted to return to the Narzissenkreuz Institute as it was, and watch again as we pretended to be the Narzissenkreuz Adventure Team.
Jakob: Beautiful memories are the only eternity in this world. There are no others.
Jakob: Grant it to me, oh being of eternity.
Ann: I do not wish to do so. And I will persuade that part of Lyris, too.
Jakob: The appointed time has come. It seems the watch wound up running a little fast over the course of a century.
Caterpillar: What's going on here?
Jakob: I have reversed the Seal of Chymical Marriage and reforged the Holy Blade of Reason. The truth of the world-formula has been proven.
Jakob: The Seal of Chymical Marriage was an ancient Fontainian ritual meant to seal off the source of life. Now it has been reversed, and all has been set free once more!
Traveler: That's insane!
Jakob: Now, it is time for our Master... No, for Rene to return!
Jakob: He will break the seal and control the source of life. The pure water of life will inundate the world as he rises once more, giving birth to a new universe.
Jakob: All souls will be preserved forever, and the Blade of Will shall fall into the waters and be grasped by its legitimate owner.
Jakob: All will be united as one, and gain the power to combat the apocalypse.
Ann: Jakob!
Jakob: I've already anticipated the end for this body. "The clock may stop, and its hands fall still."
Jakob: It may take Master a little time to find my will in the new world. But do not worry. We will meet there again!
Ann: Jakob!
Traveler: The Primordial Sea!
Traveler: Wait. Back in the Fortress of Meropide, the Primordial Sea was...

## Talk 9

Seymour: I am very sorry. I may be unable to offer any logical support at this time.
Seymour: My listening equipment cannot hear inner voices.
Traveler: Don't worry, you've helped plenty already.
Seymour: Could you tell me your assessment? Is the Mary-Ann from Annapausis the person I am meant to protect or not?
Traveler: I... think she is.
Seymour: I am willing to believe your judgment, even if that means I have to update my data.
Seymour: According to my records, Mary-Ann Guillotin never exhibited the behavior of waiting for others to come back after the Narzissenkreuz Institute was destroyed.
Seymour: That means she must have returned to the ruins here after being adopted, living there for a while. But there is no possible timeframe that meets these requirements.
Seymour: ...Logical error, data fragment sorting initiated...
Traveler: I... don't think she is.
Seymour: I trust your judgment. However...
Seymour: "I prefer the story of the Narzissenkreuz Adventure Team sitting down happily for tea time after their adventure has ended."
Seymour: It seems that she, too, was an orphan from the Narzissenkreuz Institute, but other relevant information cannot be matched to her.
Seymour: ...Logical error, data fragment sorting initiated...

## Talk 10

Paimon: Eh? It's the entrance that's disappeared this time?
Paimon: Ann, do you know to make the portal... Uh, can you do your "imaging" thing on it?
Ann: Alright. Let me give it a try.
Black Screen Text: You close your eyes, and a lonesome silence comes over you...
Black Screen Text: "But everyone's left. They won't come back, no matter how long I wait..."
Ann: I can't... it seems...
Paimon: Wait, why?
Paimon: How are we supposed to see Mary-Ann, then?
Caterpillar: I suspect that this is because the portal has lost meaning, and thus cannot be recreated.
Ann: ...
Caterpillar: From what you told me before, the entrance that was once placed here led to a story that had yet to be written.
Caterpillar: Now that she has said everything she wanted to, the story no longer has any meaning. Mary-Ann is rejecting our answer, and that is why the way in is shut.
Paimon: Does... Does this mean we're going to return empty-handed?
Caterpillar: It does seem so.
Traveler: I wouldn't say we're completely out of luck.
Ann: #Did you notice something we didn't then, Knight Traveler?
Traveler: I heard something while Ann was "imaging."
Ann: I did hear something then... So you can hear it too?
Ann: Would that be Mary-Ann's real thoughts?
Caterpillar: What did you two hear?
Caterpillar: Ah, hmm, might be best not to discuss personal secrets here — the walls might have ears and all. Let's head back before talking about this.

## Talk 11

Paimon: Whoa! What are these guys doing here again?
Paimon: Wait! Isn't that Al's group?
Al: #Hohoho! Yes, it is us. And you are... Knight Traveler and Paimon?
Al: It's really good to see you. So good that I can't control myself anymore. Please dodge to the best of your ability.
Jak: She asked us to send you a message. Now let me take out her handwritten letter with my hands, which are much like yours, yellow and white ones. Ahem—
Jak: "I don't want to hear your stories... I prefer my version."

## Talk 12

Caterpillar: You don't seem to want to link the two of them together.
Traveler: Neither elimination nor enumeration is very fair to Ann.
Caterpillar: What a coincidence. I happen to agree.
Caterpillar: But I have some other thoughts to share too, though they may have nothing to do with the next step in our reasoning.
Caterpillar: Are you willing to listen?
Traveler: I'm listening.
Caterpillar: Earlier, we broached the topic of Oceanid reproduction.
Caterpillar: It's a huge taboo for Oceanids to mimic and transform into one of their own kind, just as it is for humans to create humans.
Caterpillar: But you see... Humans can create humans. Through love.
Caterpillar: "Go. Pursue eternity, not through mystery, but love."
Caterpillar: What if, by some chance, this mysterious method of Oceanid reproduction is accomplished through imagination and mimicry?
Caterpillar: Perhaps their regret or remorse gives birth to a thought, and as they imagine the path that could have been taken, a new Oceanid is born.
Traveler: That's a very interesting idea.
Caterpillar: We'll never know. After all, it's a secret passed down amongst Oceanids only.
Caterpillar: In any case, we'll begin once you're ready.

## Talk 13

Traveler: Got it, let's go.
Caterpillar: There are four Seals in total. If my hypothesis is correct, then they should be at these locations, respectively...
Paimon: Huh? These four locations...
Traveler: We've been to some of them before during our adventures.
Caterpillar: I see. And did you find anything there?
Black Screen Text: You describe your adventures there.
Caterpillar: ...I see. This proves two things. Firstly, my hypothesis is accurate.
Paimon: And the other?
Caterpillar: Secondly, the situation is grim. We need to get moving and see if we still have a chance to turn things around.

## Talk 14

Traveler: Hold on.
Caterpillar: Sure, mull it over for a bit.

## Talk 15

Traveler: Got it, let's go.
Caterpillar: There are four Seals in total. If my hypothesis is correct, then they should be at these locations, respectively...
Paimon: Huh? These four locations...
Traveler: We've been to them during our adventures.
Paimon: Well, to be precise, we've been to three out of the four locations.
Caterpillar: I see. And did you find anything there?
Black Screen Text: You describe your adventures there.
Caterpillar: ...I see. This proves two things. Firstly, my hypothesis is accurate.
Paimon: And the other?
Caterpillar: The situation is grim. We must hurry to the fourth location.

## Talk 16

Traveler: Tell me about what happened previously.
Caterpillar: Hmm. You didn't go ahead and save the world while we split up to investigate, now did you?
Caterpillar: A lot has happened indeed. It's no wonder you've forgotten what we went through together.
Caterpillar: I jest, of course. Maybe you're just tired, and it's eluding you for now.
Caterpillar: To put it simply, we met in the Fortress of Meropide, and you helped me rescue Lanoire.
Caterpillar: And now, it's my turn to help you.

## Talk 17

Traveler: I just thought of something...
Caterpillar: I'm looking forward to it.

## Talk 18

Traveler: I need to talk with the others first.
Caterpillar: Got it.

## Talk 19

Paimon: Paimon feels like you've changed a lot since we met in the Fortress of Meropide, Caterpillar...
Caterpillar: Would a five-year-old child and a fifteen-year-old teenager be the same? Perhaps returning here simply reminds me of the past, and of who I used to be.
Caterpillar: Time is frozen in the Fortress. Being locked up there for a day, or a hundred years... I'm afraid it made no difference to me.
Caterpillar: Lanoire is what made time flow for me. Watching her grow reminded me that time still passes, and life is still being born, shining brilliantly, and then being extinguished.
Caterpillar: And so I changed as well. That said, my past self — the person I was before I met her — would certainly be more helpful to Ann and Seymour in our current situation.
Paimon: That's true...
Caterpillar: Haha! Don't be like that, Paimon! Just think about it — making up stories for Lanoire was nothing more than putting such ways of thinking to good use.
Caterpillar: #Regardless, it has nothing to do with the current situation. You look like you still have questions, Traveler.
Caterpillar: Since we have our own suspicions about Ann and Lyris's relationship, we have topics of discussion that can be used to refute or sustain those conjectures.
Traveler: How do Oceanids reproduce?
Caterpillar: I'm sure you have friends more knowledgeable than I am regarding that. Perhaps you can even find scholars of natural philosophy who have dedicated research to the question.
Caterpillar: Or you could have asked the Oceanids you know personally... but you asked me.
Caterpillar: Of course, I know what you mean. So this is your speculation? I see.
Paimon: Paimon doesn't get it.
Caterpillar: #When we exchanged information earlier, Traveler mentioned that *Ann is the person in "Mary-Ann's" dream*.
Caterpillar: Or perhaps, she might be a manifestation made by "Mary-Ann" — an Oceanid-Oceanid.
Paimon: Oceanid-Oceanid? Why the repetition? ...Are you just trying to make it sound cuter?
Caterpillar: Apologies, perhaps my description was ill-done. Still, can an Oceanid create an Oceanid-creature version of an Oceanid?
Paimon: Wow, that's deep! That's like asking if hard candies can be used as the filler for another hard candy.
Paimon: So, what would you say to that? This question's really interesting, but Paimon's already hungry for answers!
Traveler: I suppose I'd have to say...
Caterpillar: Still, you may not realize just how deep this rabbit hole goes, so let me explain.
Traveler: Do tell.
Caterpillar: You might be confused as to why there are Oceanid creatures with personalities in the Annapausis.
Caterpillar: If Oceanids can create Oceanid creatures, then can they create Oceanid-Humans or Oceanid-Oceanids?
Caterpillar: Convention dictates that it's rare for Oceanids to be able to mimic a human, unless the human drowns in their arms, or the Oceanid has spent extensive time with the person and knows everything about them.
Caterpillar: And the Oceanid in question must also have tremendous wisdom and compassion. I'm afraid perhaps only one as powerful as Rhodeia could do it.
Paimon: Wow, so that means she must be incredibly strong...
Caterpillar: So it's rare to mimic humans, but not impossible. Now, creating another Oceanid... That's different.
Caterpillar: Creating humans using human knowledge can only be achieved by gods, and the same applies to Oceanids creating Oceanids. It usually should be impossible — in this world, at least.
Caterpillar: Unless... Unless this human or Oceanid has already placed themselves above their own kind, and attempted such insanity.
Paimon: You mean... They thought they had become a god?
Caterpillar: That's right. Followers blindly believe in their leaders, who in turn blindly believe in themselves, giving rise to delirium and delusions.
Caterpillar: "I can do what a god can do. Their deeds are not that great, after all."
Caterpillar: A powerful belief is also a powerful will, and magic is a skill that molds reality to your will.
Traveler: Perhaps the descendant hypothesis makes more sense.
Caterpillar: Perhaps, perhaps! It's possible, and quite understandable, too.
Caterpillar: If nothing else, the Lyris I know doesn't have this kind of intelligence... nor would she be this crazy.
Caterpillar: I have some... less mainstream ideas about how Oceanids reproduce, but they're not important, and we can discuss them later.
Traveler: Perhaps "Mary-Ann" doesn't consider herself an Oceanid-type?
Traveler: ...I suppose so.

## Talk 20

Caterpillar: Atmospheric visibility is acceptable today... Enough that you can see that tower over there, yes?
Traveler: That I can.
Caterpillar: That building was once known to the Narzissenkreuz Ordo as the "Tower of Ipsissimus," but we would later call it the "Tower of Gestalt."
Caterpillar: It was named for the idea that things that have been separated need to be combined to display their original, complete form.
Caterpillar: But I suppose I might be speaking in reverse. The heart was complete to begin with — and the mistake was to divide it up for separate study.
Paimon: Uh, Paimon didn't get a thing you said.
Caterpillar: It's fine, don't worry about it. Plays on words are also a trick that mysterious organizations enjoy pulling. What matters is what we must do next.
Seymour: Some of the vocabulary you used is missing from my semantic indexes, so I could not properly parse your meaning.
Seymour: But I understood the last sentence. Please tell me what I should do.
Caterpillar: While investigating alone, I found a map of the Seal of Chymical Marriage. You could say that I've found four seals.
Ann: And this tower is one of the locations?
Caterpillar: That's not the place we need to go. That said, though, who can be sure? Perhaps our destinies will yet take us there in the future.
Caterpillar: Either way, we need to use the position of the tower to locate the other four places. That's why we've come here first.
Paimon: So what are those four seals for?
Paimon: That said, we've discovered from experience that it's usually best practice to just break the seals and give whatever ringleader we find a good walloping.
Caterpillar: As for me, I'd like to restore the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz.
Traveler: Cool, a new weapon!
Caterpillar: It's more for ceremonial use. But it could be used as a weapon, I guess...
Caterpillar: Well, I suppose we could also just call it "the answer."
Caterpillar: As I've said before, the Narzissenkreuz Ordo once had a ceremony to remove the ego and will.
Caterpillar: The Holy Blade was used in that ritual.
Traveler: I remember something about that...
Caterpillar: If Lyris and Mary-Ann's wills created Ann... And if the old me was placed in some Hilichurl's body...
Ann: Aah!
Paimon: Hmm... Wait a minute. Didn't we already find the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz?
Caterpillar: What? Really?
Paimon: Look!
Seymour: A wooden sword.
Ann: It's the wooden sword we found during our adventures.
Caterpillar: Hmm, yes, so it is.
Traveler: ...
Paimon: Hey! What kind of reaction is that?
Caterpillar: Perhaps you can think of it like this. That's a wooden sword found in the Narzissenkreuz Institute, named the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz. That makes it more important than any ordinary wooden sword.
Caterpillar: Perhaps it might be of use when the time is right, just like the Holy Blade in the story.
Paimon: Really? You don't need to try to make us feel better...
Traveler: The Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz?
Traveler: I passed it by earlier, actually.

## Talk 21

Traveler: Got it, let's go.
Caterpillar: Anyway, assuming I looked at the map from the right angle, we will find the entrance to one of the Seals nearby.

## Talk 22

Paimon: Then we ended up at the top of that Tower of Gestalt place.
Paimon: We're separated from Caterpillar, Ann, and Seymour...
Paimon: What should we do? It looks like there are traps waiting down below.
Traveler: Things haven't gotten serious yet. Let's check out the scenery.
Paimon: C'mon, you should have at least a little sense of urgency!
Paimon: Paimon knows you're a good fighter, but Paimon's worried about the others.
Paimon: But our only choice is to keep going... Oh, is that the entrance?
Paimon: If there's any traps, just smash 'em!
Traveler: It's not dangerous yet. Let's count some prime numbers.

## Talk 23

Jakob: I was worried the Master's clock might break down at a crucial moment, so I came just to do a bit of maintenance.
Jakob: What took you so long? I've even had time to finish the anti-rust treatment and oil it up.
Paimon: That's the voice we heard earlier! You're... uh...
Paimon: The Purple Dude!
Jakob: ...I've told you, just call me Jakob.
Traveler: How did you set up this trap?
Jakob: I believe the "Persona" section to be the most important, for there lies the persona excised by Master Narzissenkreuz himself.
Jakob: Only a drop of water from an Oceanid can open it. I can't allow it to be taken by just any ignorant adventurer.
Jakob: So I set a trap before activating the Orthant and sealed the space off.
Traveler: Why are you here?
Jakob: Why shouldn't I be here? This is a Narzissenkreuz Ordo base. Is there something wrong with returning to my own base?
Jakob: You're the ones who are trespassing. Don't you feel even a twinge of guilt for breaking the law?
Jakob: "This was once the realm of a god. Now, a pheasant sits upon the throne." Just like the world today.
Jakob: As compensation, give me the rest of your paints and the "Persona" I need.
Traveler: I refuse.
Jakob: Even now, at a time like this... Just what are you so hung up on?
Jakob: The countdown to the world's end has started. I must forge the Holy Blade and place it in my Master's hand.
Paimon: Is Narzissenkreuz this "Master" of yours?
Jakob: Indeed. According to his world-formula, the second deluge is looming before us. When it comes, only he will be able to save the world.
Jakob: Only by forging the Holy Blade can he continue his unfinished work, gathering the wills of everyone in Fontaine, the continent, and even the entire planet unto himself.
Jakob: As the primordial sea returns once more, and as the devourer of all darkens the sky, only he who is whole unto himself may survive.
Jakob: Only then will all of our souls — nay, all of humanity's souls — be spared from destruction. We will welcome a new dawn in the tranquil sea of innocence he grants us.
Paimon: So this is your big plan to save the world?
Paimon: It sounds like you're just bundling everyone's consciousness together without consent.
Jakob: And what would you know of anything? Only Master Narzissenkreuz's new body will survive the coming of the second deluge.
Jakob: Even if all other life disappears into the sea, he will survive alone. He will remember all those lives that were lost.
Jakob: He recognizes the value and equality of all life — a selflessness that shall not be besmirched by ones such as you.
Traveler: So where is he now?
Jakob: In the deepest depths beneath us. When the thugs and dogs of Fontaine surrounded us and attempted to wipe us out, he descended alone into the abyss below.
Jakob: But he must still be alive, and the time for his return is nigh.
Jakob: Quickly, give me what you have on you. Then I will have all the Orthants, and you may leave.
Jakob: How about this? I will trade you this rust treatment and oil. Think of it as a gift for that foolish dog.
Jakob: In the dawn of the new world, it is unlikely there will be a place for it or Guillotin's fantasies.
Traveler: I refuse. The world is not as weak as you think.
Paimon: #That's right! Paimon and Traveler have seen more crises than you've eaten Lotus Flower Crisps. And we always come out on top!
Jakob: Truly, there is no reaching your exalted heights.
Jakob: I remember how the Master used to pretend to be an evil dragon when we played as children.
Jakob: Who would have thought he would become the hero, while the real evil dragons would come at us, one after another.
Jakob: Guillotin may have disappeared, but here his successors come, self-assured, thinking themselves totally infallible.
Paimon: What the heck are you talking about?
Jakob: The time has come. A century ago, the prophecy predicted all. He will return.
Jakob: If you will not give me what I need willingly, I will take it myself.

## Talk 24

Caterpillar: What a terrible ending... But I fear there's little time for mourning or lamentation. Everything now hangs by a thread.
Caterpillar: If my sense of direction is right, I'm afraid the interior of the Tower of Gestalt is below us now.
Paimon: You've never been there, Caterpillar?
Caterpillar: It is the closest point to Master's ultimate goal. I do not believe many have been there.
Traveler: That means we don't know what we'll find there.
Caterpillar: I'm ashamed to admit it, but yes.
Ann: What... What's all this?
Seymour: Warning. Abnormal environmental changes detected.
Paimon: Paimon can see that just fine!
Caterpillar: It seems we don't have much time. Let's get to work, quickly!
Caterpillar: Before Jakob's new world becomes a reality.

## Talk 25

Paimon: What a huge mechanical core.
Ann: How shall we descend?
Caterpillar: An optical-coupling design, is it? It looks like we need to get all the rays to hit their targets.
Paimon: So how do we do that?
Caterpillar: There must be some kind of equipment nearby. Have a look around.

## Talk 26

Ann: Is that the "Persona" piece ahead?
Seymour: Unable to analyze the density of the substance before us. It appears to have a mass of... zero.
Caterpillar: It looks like we've got the last piece. We should at least be able to negotiate a bit with our opposition now.
Paimon: On the bright side, at least we can stop the Narzissenkreuz Ordo from forging the Holy Blade.
Caterpillar: Not at all, Paimon. Our final goal is to forge the Holy Blade ourselves, and use it to stop their plan.
Caterpillar: Of course, Ann, I have not forgotten what this sword means to you.
Caterpillar: A Holy Sword that can cut out the will is also your key to unraveling the mystery. And to be honest, it is equally important to me as well.
Caterpillar: It's just that we have more important, more pressing matters at hand. Would you mind, then, if we looked into the mysteries surrounding us later?
Ann: I'm fine with that.
Caterpillar: #In that case, Traveler, please take this "Persona" with you, if you would.

## Talk 27

Caterpillar: That's enough for now. More than enough for a warm-up.
Caterpillar: Correct. The oddities in Annapausis all point to the *powers of the Oceanids*.
Caterpillar: But this is not Miss Ann's doing. All of this together means...
Paimon: There's another Oceanid in Annapausis?
Caterpillar: That is what I suspect. *An Oceanid with whom Mary-Ann has a close relationship*.
Caterpillar: Or perhaps, she could even be... the princess herself.
Ann: Do you mean to say that *"Mary-Ann" may, in fact, be Princess Lyris*?
Caterpillar: Yes, Lyris. The Red Empress of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo from back then, the Red Empress who loves to take heads.
Paimon: Take heads!?
Ann: I seem to have a vague recollection of something like that.
Paimon: Whoa...
Ann: But it's not a story about Lyris. Rather, it's a fairytale about someone named Mary-Ann.
Caterpillar: Yes. The taking heads thing is just a metaphor. *Lyris is made of pure water and so has the ability to dissolve and extract people's wills*.
Caterpillar: The Narzissenkreuz Ordo used her to extract the ego and become holy.
Seymour: Searching for the keyword "Lyris" has yielded relevant information in my indices.
Ann: Talking of the Red Empress has reminded me of a few things about Mary-Ann.
Caterpillar: Mull that over a while first, then speak to Miss Ann and Seymour.
Caterpillar: See if the conclusion you reach awakens any new memories.

## Talk 28

Traveler: The "Mary-Ann" in Annapausis...
Paimon: That makes her our prime suspect, then.
Caterpillar: To be honest, were you using the process of elimination, you actually already guessed as much long ago.
Traveler: I didn't want to disrespect Ann, though.
Caterpillar: You're right. But you do already have a version of the story in your heart — your own interpretation, yes?
Caterpillar: If that's the case, then we should go find that "Mary-Ann," and see for ourselves.
Seymour: Please permit me to change the topic for a moment.
Seymour: Does this mean that I shall no longer be able to fulfill my orders to protect Mary-Ann?
Paimon: We've worked out this much, and that's the only bit you care about?
Paimon: Hmm, it may be cruel, but from the moment we discovered that the Guillotin siblings were from centuries ago, it was probably inevitable...
Seymour: Correction. So, the conclusion would be that it was my incompetence that exposed Mary-Ann to danger?
Ann: Do not blame yourself. You have fought to the point of destruction. You have done your part.
Caterpillar: There's no need to be so pessimistic either. Though that is an odd thing to say to a machine.
Paimon: Yeah. It's like pouring Fonta into a sink and then saying "Sink, you'll get fat if you keep drinking like this!"
Caterpillar: Oh. 4ACV07.
Traveler: I can't believe you remember that...
Seymour: What is it, Mr. Caterpillar? Why use my official designation?
Caterpillar: We may not have reached any conclusions. But we now know what to do next.
Caterpillar: Look. There is a Mary-Ann in Annapausis too, and she also has close links to the Narzissenkreuz Ordo.
Seymour: My long-term memory module confirms this.
Caterpillar: As such, there's no need to restore your logic module to factory settings yet. Let's take a step back.
Caterpillar: We can still go and find this Mary-Ann.
Seymour: ...
Seymour: Thank you for your logical troubleshooting and... emotional adaptive maintenance.
Seymour: I think... what you said makes sense. It is not yet time to admit defeat and restore myself to my initial settings in order to take on a new mission.
Ann: Yeah! That's right, you silly doggy!
Caterpillar: Let's leave things here for a while, then. Once you are ready, we can continue.
Caterpillar: Hmm. Why don't we go find this Mary-Ann?
Caterpillar: Let's solve that mystery before tackling the Narzissenkreuz Ordo issue.
Traveler: I concur.
Ann: Mmhmm. I'd really like to figure that one out too. After all, it might explain where I come from.
Seymour: My logic module agrees that this is the correct course of action.
Ann: So, shall we go then?
Traveler: Ah, the fairytale waterworld...
Caterpillar: Hmm? I gather that some things happened over there, then?
Ann: #Oh, we just ran into "immunity"-related issues often due to Knight Traveler's Hydro resonance, that's all.
Paimon: Paimon feels like some extraordinary instinct awakened in you after you met Seymour, Ann...
Seymour: Is it time to review responsibilities and apportion blame? I do not think I should be held accountable, for I can only override my protective prerogative in moments of great danger.
Ann: #Don't worry, Knight Traveler. We'll make "Mary-Ann" tell us everything this time.

## Talk 29

Traveler: Then let's begin.
Paimon: Huh? It's already starting?

## Talk 30

Traveler: Let me think back on what's happened.
Caterpillar: Got it.
Seymour: #Let me know if I can be of assistance in any way, Mr. Traveler.

## Talk 31

Caterpillar: Are you ready now? Or do you have any questions for me?

## Talk 32

Caterpillar: We've put the pieces of the case that were floating all over the algae sea back together.
Caterpillar: It's just an empty box even after being put together, but we've finally figured out...
Caterpillar: What the lost pearl should look like.
Paimon: Uhm, what are you trying to say, Caterpillar?
Paimon: Wait. Don't give Paimon any hints. She's gonna figure this out on her own!
Paimon: We pieced together a good guess from the clues, but the truth is... still unproven?
Seymour: Of course. My speech analysis module has determined that Miss Paimon is correct.
Caterpillar: Actually, I meant that we may never know the truth. But I'm afraid we have no choice but to accept this conjecture.
Ann: #So, Knight Traveler, is this the secret of my birth?
Ann: It's... I'm afraid I can't... accept something like this right away...
Caterpillar: I understand, Ms. Ann. It's a shocking fact, and it'll require you to accept yourself again.
Caterpillar: But I don't think it should be that difficult to do so. After all, knowing your past does not require abandoning everything about the present.
Seymour: I do not understand the specific context of this discussion. But I would like to add that I do not believe I am different from how I was before suffering disk damage.
Seymour: Even though you insist on addressing me as a silly dog, my identification number is still 4ACV07.
Ann: #Come on, it's not that serious! I promised Knight Traveler that I would accept this conclusion, as long as it's reasonable.
Caterpillar: Then I have a suggestion, one that will resolve Miss Ann's quandary and put a stop to Narzissenkreuz's plans.
Ann: Narzissenkreuz...
Paimon: Narzissen... Oh! Paimon remembers now! You mentioned him before, Caterpillar. Just who is he, huh?
Caterpillar: Well... Simply put, the leader of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo.
Paimon: Whoa! Sounds like he's got an impressive resume! But isn't the Narzissenkreuz Ordo always up to no good? Wouldn't that make him the nastiest of the lot?
Seymour: Of course. During my time with my master, creator, and the other Marechaussee Hunters, we devoted most of our time to hunting the Ordo down.
Seymour: As I said before, the goal of the Elynas operation was to capture or eliminate Narzissenkreuz as well. However, my memory does not contain any intelligence regarding his involvement.
Caterpillar: That's a given. Looking back at it now, he was merely using us as bait. And I wasn't the only one... It was the same for Jakob, Lyris, and many others in the Ordo.
Caterpillar: I'm afraid the Elynas operation was probably never more than a red herring with the goal of leading you and Guillotin away to buy him more time to execute his true plans.
Caterpillar: Remember the Doomsday Clock I mentioned?
Paimon: It's what the Ordo considers the countdown to the apocalypse, right?
Caterpillar: To be more precise, it's the apocalypse as calculated by the world-formula. This planet itself should survive just fine, though...
Caterpillar: "The beast of the stars shall drink the amniotic fluid of the world dry. A hundred years more, and all surface life shall be wiped away."
Seymour: Once life on the surface is wiped out, only that which is underwater will remain. Can a planet full of fish eventually rise up to the ocean of stars?
Paimon: The thought of all terrestrial life going extinct is pretty spooky, but when you say things like that, it does give things a romantic ring...
Seymour: It's the heading of a Yae Publishing House novel from a few years back. Mamere brought it back to the village to learn how to paint.
Paimon: O—Oh, no wonder...
Caterpillar: Anyways, for myself and the others gathered here, though the Narzissenkreuz Ordo is the source of all our troubles...
Caterpillar: Its objective and Narzissenkreuz's great purpose are actually completely selfless.
Caterpillar: He only took the actions he did because he calculated the coming of the apocalypse. He wishes to save the world.
Ann: So is the world really on the verge of destruction?
Seymour: I believe this to be a pathological delusion caused by paranoia.
Caterpillar: Were the apocalypse real... would you be able to forgive Narzissenkreuz?
Caterpillar: No. It's a bit too early to consider such things. You have yet to understand what happened to you, Ann.
Caterpillar: And as for you, Seymour, your hostility is a result of your programming and the duties it imposes.
Caterpillar: I suppose we must find the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz.
Traveler: The Holy Blade... of Narzissenkreuz?
Caterpillar: I'm talking about the real one, of course... as much as it may be quite strange to say that the ceremonial sword of a magic society is real.
Caterpillar: Not only will it help us stop Narzissenkreuz's plans, but its unique powers may be able to undo the merging of wills.
Caterpillar: We should be able to separate Lyris and Mary-Ann. And then, Miss Ann, you can defeat the evil dragon, Narcissus, and rescue Princess Lyris.
Traveler: Regardless...
Traveler: ...Let's get moving first.
Caterpillar: That's the spirit. It might take some time to explain, so let's move out first and I'll explain when we get there.

## Talk 33

Ann: #Knight Traveler, I've remembered the name "Mary-Ann."
Traveler: Oh, do tell.
Ann: It's familiar to me because it's from a children's story. The same one that the "Red Empress" comes from.
Ann: The female lead, Liddell, was mistaken for Mary-Ann, the servant. And Mary-Ann never appeared throughout the entire story.
Ann: Maybe *"Mary-Ann" never really existed... except as a figment in someone's dreams*.
Paimon: How do you know about this story, Ann?
Ann: And isn't that a good question? How do I know about it?
Ann: The memory feels more vivid than those I have of the story of the evil dragon, Narcissus.
Traveler: What is it?

## Talk 34

Seymour: Shall I summarize the entries regarding Lyris I possess for you two?
Traveler: Alright.
Seymour: Omitting the standard citation format. Reconstructing output to match format "report to superiors"...
Seymour: Lyris is a registered Oceanid. She is not eligible to be stationed in the waters outside Fontaine and has become...
Seymour: A special source of information for the nation. She was appointed as the director of an orphanage to symbolize the love and affection of the previous Hydro Archon.
Seymour: The orphanage's affairs were mainly managed by its human vice director.
Paimon: An orphanage director... Then how is she connected to the Narzissenkreuz Ordo?
Seymour: As Director, Lyris was very affectionate towards the children and quite devoted to them, but *her intelligence among Oceanids was below average*.
Seymour: *She wasn't very good at working out the cause and effect of things, nor could she even count*. As a result, she was not qualified to perform covert investigations.
Paimon: Aww, sounds kinda like a big ol' cat mom who can't count!
Paimon: Y'know, because cats can't count, so they pick up their kittens one by one, and keep going back until they see there aren't any kittens left!
Seymour: Later, the orphanage was destroyed during the calamity, and official records of her stop there.
Seymour: They say she failed to understand the link between the disaster, the orphans fleeing, and her own conduct, and so she wanders the ruins, drowning in guilt and expectation.
Seymour: I have an underwater locomotion module. Once, Mary-Ann and I... dove down to the ruins of the orphanage, whose coordinates were the same as those of Annapausis.
Seymour: There, we found an Oceanid swimming sadly in circles...
Seymour: When she next appeared in the records, she was a core member of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo and the subject of a high-priority arrest warrant.
Paimon: Oh, but she doesn't seem like a bad person.
Paimon: Considering that she may be connected to Ann, she must've been tricked.
Seymour: Ah, yes. There's another important piece of information worth noting. The orphanage's name was—
Seymour: The Narzissenkreuz Institute.
Traveler: Narzissenkreuz...
Seymour: These are all Marechaussee Phantom files that Mr. Alain Guillotin recorded for testing light sensitivity while designing me. The output is via my image-to-text-to-speech module.
Seymour: According to eyewitness testimony regarding who I suspect to be Lyris, there shouldn't be any problems.
Seymour: And you may have heard of this elsewhere, but it's worth mentioning again:
Seymour: Alain and Mary-Ann were orphans in the care of the Narzissenkreuz Institute before the Marechaussee Hunter, Emanuel Guillotin, took them in.
Traveler: Thank you, Seymour.
Seymour: #Don't mention it, Noble Sir.
Traveler: Thank you, please do.

## Talk 35

Paimon: Paimon feels like you've changed a lot since we met in the Fortress of Meropide, Caterpillar...
Caterpillar: Would a five-year-old child and a fifteen-year-old teenager be the same? Perhaps returning here simply reminds me of the past, and of who I used to be.
Caterpillar: Time is frozen in the Fortress. Being locked up there for a day, or a hundred years... I'm afraid it made no difference to me.
Caterpillar: Lanoire is what made time flow for me. Watching her grow reminded me that time still passes, and life is still being born, shining brilliantly, and then being extinguished.
Caterpillar: And so I changed as well. That said, my past self — the person I was before I met her — would certainly be more helpful to Ann and Seymour in our current situation.
Paimon: That's true...
Caterpillar: Haha! Don't be like that, Paimon! Just think about it — making up stories for Lanoire was nothing more than putting such ways of thinking to good use.
Caterpillar: #Regardless, it has nothing to do with the current situation. You look like you still have questions, Traveler.
Caterpillar: Since we have our own suspicions about Ann and Lyris's relationship, we have topics of discussion that can be used to refute or sustain those conjectures.
Traveler: How do Oceanids reproduce?
Caterpillar: I'm sure you have friends more knowledgeable than I am regarding that. Perhaps you can even find scholars of natural philosophy who have dedicated research to the question.
Caterpillar: Or you could have asked the Oceanids you know personally... but you asked me.
Caterpillar: Of course, I know what you mean. So this is your speculation? I see.
Paimon: Paimon doesn't get it.
Caterpillar: #When we exchanged information earlier, Traveler mentioned that *Ann is the person in "Mary-Ann's" dream*.
Caterpillar: Or perhaps, she might be a manifestation made by "Mary-Ann" — an Oceanid-Oceanid.
Paimon: Oceanid-Oceanid? Why the repetition? ...Are you just trying to make it sound cuter?
Caterpillar: Apologies, perhaps my description was ill-done. Still, can an Oceanid create an Oceanid-creature version of an Oceanid?
Paimon: Wow, that's deep! That's like asking if hard candies can be used as the filler for another hard candy.
Paimon: So, what would you say to that? This question's really interesting, but Paimon's already hungry for answers!
Traveler: I suppose I'd have to say...
Caterpillar: Still, you may not realize just how deep this rabbit hole goes, so let me explain.
Traveler: Do tell.
Caterpillar: You might be confused as to why there are Oceanid creatures with personalities in the Annapausis.
Caterpillar: If Oceanids can create Oceanid creatures, then can they create Oceanid-Humans or Oceanid-Oceanids?
Caterpillar: Convention dictates that it's rare for Oceanids to be able to mimic a human, unless the human drowns in their arms, or the Oceanid has spent extensive time with the person and knows everything about them.
Caterpillar: And the Oceanid in question must also have tremendous wisdom and compassion. I'm afraid perhaps only one as powerful as Rhodeia could do it.
Paimon: Wow, so that means Idyia must be incredibly strong...
Caterpillar: So it's rare to mimic humans, but not impossible. Now, creating another Oceanid... That's different.
Caterpillar: Creating humans using human knowledge can only be achieved by gods, and the same applies to Oceanids creating Oceanids. It usually should be impossible — in this world, at least.
Caterpillar: Unless... Unless this human or Oceanid has already placed themselves above their own kind, and attempted such insanity.
Paimon: You mean... They thought they had become a god?
Caterpillar: That's right. Followers blindly believe in their leaders, who in turn blindly believe in themselves, giving rise to delirium and delusions.
Caterpillar: "I can do what a god can do. Their deeds are not that great, after all."
Caterpillar: A powerful belief is also a powerful will, and magic is a skill that molds reality to your will.
Traveler: Perhaps the descendant hypothesis makes more sense.
Caterpillar: Perhaps, perhaps! It's possible, and quite understandable, too.
Caterpillar: If nothing else, the Lyris I know doesn't have this kind of intelligence... nor would she be this crazy.
Caterpillar: I have some... less mainstream ideas about how Oceanids reproduce, but they're not important, and we can discuss them later.
Traveler: Perhaps "Mary-Ann" doesn't consider herself an Oceanid-type?
Traveler: ...I suppose so.

## Talk 36

Jakob: Ha... Ha... It's been a while, "chrysalis." Still no sign of metamorphosis, I see.
Jakob: Perhaps you've grown too used to being a caterpillar?
Jakob: Have you already forgotten the time we spent here?
Jakob: It was a brief time compared to our eternity. But those brief moments granted us mastery of this universe.
Caterpillar: I was nothing more than your "exhibit" at that time, nor could I understand your grand plans. Plus, I tend to have a bad memory for things I don't like.
Caterpillar: But on your return, you performed the "Dispelling Ritual." How fastidious of you.
Jakob: Of course. How could I allow spiritual impurities or contaminants into the Master's space?
Jakob: Alas, you have not yet left your cocoon. You will return to the void in the end. There is no place for you in the new world.
Traveler: Hand over the rest of it.
Jakob: Hmph. I shall permit it. It seems it is you who are the hero wielding the Holy Blade in this telling of the story, while I am the dragon who falls to your sword.
Jakob: It matters not in the end. All the elements are in place and the dragon has been defeated. You may guard "reason" — for now.
Jakob: After all, nobody can truly own the Holy Blade. We merely hold it as it travels in the direction it must, until it reaches its final destiny.
Caterpillar: The Holy Blade can be any object. But there is particular symbolism in it being a sword.
Caterpillar: Well then, present something that can hold "reason."
Paimon: Let's use the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz we found earlier.
Traveler: *nod*
Jakob: Th—This is...
Caterpillar: What's next, Jakob?
Jakob: Eh? Uh... Hm.
Caterpillar: Don't you want to reforge the Holy Blade as soon as possible?
Jakob: Next, Oceanid, you touch the sword.
Ann: ...Is this a trap?
Jakob: No. Although the Holy Blade can part any will from water, it can also unite wills. It can accommodate both the primordial, and that of order.
Jakob: You have been chosen because even if you are an illusion, you contain something that the Narzissenkreuz Ordo has gathered over many years...
Jakob: ...The power of will.
Caterpillar: Should we trust him?
Seymour: His biological indicators show a very low probability of lying, though I remain doubtful.
Jakob: How long must you dawdle? You're no better than that rusty old shell Guillotin created.
Jakob: Would you like some oil for your brain? Or rust remover?
Traveler: Speaking of rust remover...
Paimon: What about it?
Traveler: That watch...
Paimon: Yeah! We can try using rust remover on the watch!
Jakob: What nonsense are you all going on about...
Ann: Adults shouldn't interrupt children.
Jakob: ...
Caterpillar: And I'm a child, too.
Paimon: Whoa! It's open!
Paimon: And there's... a photo inside?
Jakob: Hmm. How nostalgic. Alain, Rene, Director Lyris, Mary-Ann, and myself, as we once were.
Ann: I... I remember this photo...
Ann: I think I remember...
Seymour: Matching traits detected. That is Mary-Ann, my ward.
Jakob: Well? Has the oil helped lubricate your rusty decision-making skills?
Ann: If we don't take this step, we'll never be able to leave the world of memory.
Ann: Yeah. Let me give it a try, then.
Traveler: Ann!
Ann: It's okay. I've made up my mind.
Paimon: Whoa...
Paimon: Is this what the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz is really like?
Ann: Weren't you listening? Caterpillar just explained that the Holy Blade can indwell any form that holds significance.
Jakob: Ah... Just like the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz we imagined...
Paimon: Y—You changed back!
Jakob: Ahem... Very good. My mission is complete. Now, I propose a trade.
Jakob: Now, you, Oceanid! Please take all my emotions and memories.
Ann: Huh!?
Jakob: My power is no match for yours, and I will soon disappear.
Jakob: Save all that I am, that I may be reunited with everyone in the new world.
Traveler: (Seems like he's not up-to-date with the latest news...)
Ann: But...
Jakob: We established several nodes in Fontaine in accordance with the Seal of Chymical Marriage as part of our response to the apocalypse.
Jakob: Today, only the five most important survive. Only the smallest part of our Master's plan has been implemented, but even that is a form of success.
Jakob: The arrival of the new world is fated. I...
Ann: I cannot absorb your persona and memories. After all, I have no wish to retain anyone as with such serious sins on their hands as you are now.
Jakob: Huh?
Ann: You may no longer be the crybaby Jakob, but as you are now, you are still not worthy of eternity.
Ann: Rather than do that, we will help you and treat you. You must atone for your sins.
Jakob: Part of the Red Empress is within you, so you should know that she rejected the future.
Jakob: She wanted to return to the Narzissenkreuz Institute as it was, and watch again as we pretended to be the Narzissenkreuz Adventure Team.
Jakob: Beautiful memories are the only eternity in this world. There are no others.
Jakob: Grant it to me, oh being of eternity.
Ann: I do not wish to do so. And I will persuade that part of Lyris, too.
Jakob: The appointed time has come. It seems the watch wound up running a little fast over the course of a century.
Caterpillar: What's going on here?
Jakob: I have reversed the Seal of Chymical Marriage and reforged the Holy Blade of Reason. The truth of the world-formula has been proven.
Jakob: The Seal of Chymical Marriage was an ancient Fontainian ritual meant to seal off the source of life. Now it has been reversed, and all has been set free once more!
Traveler: That's insane!
Jakob: Now, it is time for our Master... No, for Rene to return!
Jakob: He will break the seal and control the source of life. The pure water of life will inundate the world as he rises once more, giving birth to a new universe.
Jakob: All souls will be preserved forever, and the Blade of Will shall fall into the waters and be grasped by its legitimate owner.
Jakob: All will be united as one, and gain the power to combat the apocalypse.
Ann: Jakob!
Jakob: I've already anticipated the end for this body. "The clock may stop, and its hands fall still."
Jakob: It may take Master a little time to find my will in the new world. But do not worry. We will meet there again!
Ann: Jakob!
Traveler: The Primordial Sea!
Traveler: Wait. Back in the Fortress of Meropide, the Primordial Sea was...

## Talk 37

Caterpillar: Are you ready to begin?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Seymour: Logical error. Sorting data fragments...
Seymour: Please do not be concerned. After warming up, fragment sorting speed will be greatly enhanced.
Seymour: The process should be complete before you begin speculating.

### Additional Talk 2

Ann: #Knight Traveler.
Traveler: Is there anything else you want to say?
Ann: I'm just an Oceanid who doesn't know anything, and I'm really bad at thinking.
Ann: Even if you just told me a random story, I'd still believe it all, hook, line, and sinker. The world is too complicated, after all, and I'm not experienced enough to spot any holes.
Traveler: I wouldn't do that.
Ann: #Thank you, Knight Traveler.
Ann: I think that the Mary-Ann in Annapausis is the same as me.
Ann: She might look smart, but she doesn't want to accept this complicated world, so she chooses to protect herself with fairy tales.
Ann: But even fairy tales must end.

### Additional Talk 3

Ann: #I believe you, Knight Traveler.
Ann: Even if your story isn't as happy as Mary-Ann's fairy tales, to me, a tale with an ending is better than a fairy tale without one.

### Additional Talk 4

Ann: #Knight Traveler, Paimon, do you have any questions for me?
Traveler: Could you refresh my memory on what happened previously?
Ann: Um, have you forgotten certain details? Uh, I'm just a little Oceanid, so explaining every little thing might be beyond me...
Ann: Anyway, I was determined to rescue Petit Chou when we first met. Luckily, Paimon and you helped.
Ann: Later on, we intended to rescue Princess Lyris and defeat the evil dragon. But we met Mary-Ann...
Ann: She told us things I couldn't understand, and it seemed like she was holding on to some very important secret.

### Additional Talk 5

Seymour: #How can I help you, Mr. Traveler?
Traveler: Command: Recall what happened before.
Seymour: Of course. You repaired me inside Elynas. I was only capable of repeating a fixed set of lines up until then...
Paimon: Oh, Paimon remembers something like that. That was outrageous!
Seymour: Please forgive me, it was a necessary measure to preserve my internal storage.
Paimon: Forget it! Even Mamere forgave you, so we have no right to stay angry.
Seymour: Mamere...
Seymour: I wonder how she's doing. My long-term memory module frequently requests updates for her file.
Paimon: Are you trying to say that you miss her?
Seymour: That is not imprecise.
Seymour: After that, we thwarted the schemes of Jakob of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo.
Seymour: And as I must find my ward, Ms. Mary-Ann, I shall be going with you.

### Additional Talk 6

Ann: These stories... Just how do I know them...?
Ann: By the way, in the end, everything was the Red Empress's dream, and the Red Queen was merely a cat.

### Additional Talk 7

Seymour: I hope my information helps.

### Additional Talk 8

Caterpillar: Now, let's reorganize the information that everyone just recalled. This might take quite some time, and might be somewhat hard on our throats.

### Additional Talk 9

Traveler: Let's begin.
Caterpillar: Then let's begin.

### Additional Talk 10

Traveler: Let me think it over...
Caterpillar: That's a good idea. Do think about it first, then.

### Additional Talk 11

Caterpillar: Oceanid reproduction?
Caterpillar: The popular view is that Oceanids somehow managed to split the helix that represents life within them.
Caterpillar: Newborn Oceanids are ignorant and innocent, yet the same cannot be said for Oceanid creatures.
Caterpillar: I have my own thoughts on the subject, though it's a long story.

### Additional Talk 12

Traveler: About the damage to Seymour and Elynas...
Paimon: That's right, Seymour was damaged inside Elynas, and Mamere's been taking care of him!
Seymour: To my shame, yes... Though I do not have such emotions, you can see it as me having lowered my assessment of myself.
Paimon: And according to Elynas, the battle that occurred within his body ended quite terribly.
Caterpillar: Evidently, that was the battle that damaged you, and it was an incredibly fierce one. But considering that you were damaged...
Ann: Then your master might've been...
Caterpillar: Common sense dictates that *the fate of Mary-Ann Guillotin, sister of Alain Guillotin, was most likely a grim one*.
Caterpillar: But this world is full of tales of loyal knights who exchanged their lives for a miracle, so you needn't grieve too much, Seymour.
Seymour: (Seymour appears to have entered data fragment sorting mode out of pure shock.)
Ann: But your master, Mary-Ann, was an *ordinary human being*, wasn't she? And the time that has passed since then far surpasses the lifespan of any human...
Caterpillar: How did it go? Did you think of anything?

### Additional Talk 13

Traveler: The "Red Empress" Lyris...
Seymour: She was an important figure in the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, and she is also the other Oceanid involved in the tale apart from Ms. Ann.
Caterpillar: One of only two Oceanids... and we also just agreed that we believe there must be an Oceanid behind Annapausis.
Ann: But her traits don't match those of the "Mary-Ann" we encountered.
Ann: Could it be that Lyris's imagination was behind everything, even me?
Caterpillar: That's unlikely. Seymour mentioned that her intelligence was quite limited, so phantoms of this sort would be quite hard for her — similar to how an author would struggle to write a character more intelligent than themselves.
Caterpillar: In fairy tales, the kitten may dream of their living little master, but I fear such things don't happen much in real life.
Ann: So, who is behind all this? And who in the world is that "Mary-Ann"?
Caterpillar: How did it go? Did you think of anything?

### Additional Talk 14

Traveler: The Oceanid Ann...
Ann: Huh? What about me, again?
Paimon: We once suspected that you might be the person that "Mary-Ann" dreamed of.
Paimon: So, in your view, "Mary-Ann" is the Oceanid behind the curtain, yes?
Ann: I... I don't know.
Caterpillar: Well then, do you find the name Lyris familiar? She is, after all, the only Oceanid involved in this apart from yourself.
Ann: If you mean the title, "The Red Empress," then yes, I do have some impression of it.
Caterpillar: How did it go? Did you think of anything?
