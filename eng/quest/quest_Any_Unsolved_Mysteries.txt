# Any Unsolved Mysteries?

Paimon: This place sure looks pretty normal.
Paimon: Guess there won't be anything to eat here...
Traveler: Don't give yourself away too soon, Paimon.
Paimon: *cough* Wâ€”Well, y'know, looking for secrets is hungry work! Everyone knows that!
Paimon: And anyway, we've recently been eating barbecue a lot to save time. Aren't you sick of that already?
Paimon: If we can find some shells or conches, we can stew them with some fruit.
Paimon: They'll be fresh and sweet and springy...
Traveler: That sounds pretty terrible. Not my cup of tea.
Paimon: Come on, give it go! It might open a whole new culinary world to you!
Paimon: #Wait a moment! Look over there, {NICKNAME}.
Paimon: That's weird, that device just appeared all of a sudden.
Paimon: And there's some luggage nearby, too. Is that Fatui gear?
Traveler: Huh. Right on the Mora, Paimon. Good work.
Paimon: Right? Paimon was right on the Mora...
Paimon: Waaait a moment. There's nothing good about this discovery!
Paimon: If this is Fatui business, then there's gotta be some scheme afoot!
Paimon: If we leave this thing be, things might eventually get out of control.
Paimon: Whatever the case, let's see what we can do about that device first. If you think we should, let's have a look through that Fatui gear.
Paimon: #Let's do this like we always do, {NICKNAME}, and then we can kick back and start looking for something to eat instead!
Traveler: Sounds like how you'd taste, Paimon.
Paimon: Hey! Paimon isn't some aquacultural product!
Traveler: Well, that's your enthusiasm explained...
