Traveler: Tell me, are there any events happening as of late?
Margaret: There have. Recently, the Angel's Share has been giving out complimentary Chicken-Mushroom Skewers, and we've been running a promotion in response.
Margaret: Since we're the Cat's Tail, our main appetizer has to be Mondstadt Grilled Fish!
Margaret: Anyway, take these, and remember to swing by some time if you're free!
