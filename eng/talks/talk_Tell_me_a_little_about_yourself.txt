Traveler: Tell me a little about yourself...
Hertha: I am the Captain of the 6th Company, in charge of logistics. You can just call me Hertha.
Hertha: My work mostly includes the charter and administration of our baggage train, resource management and record-keeping.
Hertha: ...But Mondstadt's state is as you have seen. With the Grand Master having taken much of our manpower with him, we have since been in a constant state of short-handedness.
Hertha: At the same time, our inventory is running a surplus to match... So I'm more than willing to exchange some of it for a little hand here and there.
Hertha: I'm taking all comers who have experience in solving problems. With any luck, we'll take some of the burden off our Acting Grand Master's shoulders.
Hertha: But first, you need to earn everyone's trust. So, how about starting from a few small errands for the citizenry?
