Traveler: Color combinations?
"Dopey Dazzler": Yeah. Bold lines and visually stimulating colors are key to graffiti.
"Dopey Dazzler": However, my observations indicate that the human eye is more likely to notice large blocks of vibrant color at a certain distance...
"Dopey Dazzler": That means we're first drawn in by a color before we consider its outline.
"Dopey Dazzler": Therefore, a combination of colors that leaves people feeling brighter with a single glance — full of vitality, even! — is crucial to how some graffiti "grabs" the eye.
"Dopey Dazzler": If you're interested in color combos, swing around for a chat anytime!
