Kanra: *sigh* He should be alright, right...?

Traveler: Who's "he," if I might ask?
Kanra: Ah, I'm talking about my lover. He is now serving as a soldier in Tatarasuna.
Kanra: I've written letters to him before, asking if he was doing well... But somehow none of these letters got a reply.
Kanra: I don't really have any other way to contact him, so I can only pray for him here. I hope that the archon will bless him and keep him safe...

Traveler: Goodbye.

Traveler: Best of luck to you.
Kanra: You are too nice. Thank you.
Kanra: Umm... You seem like a seasoned Traveler. I'll give this amulet to you, it'll protect you in your journeys ahead.
Kanra: If I can see my lover again, I'll prepare one for him as well...
