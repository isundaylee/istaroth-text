Aratani: Hello there, distinguished guests of Lady Yae and the Almighty Shogun.
Traveler: And you are...?
Aratani: Eh? Have you seriously forgotten who I am?
Aratani: I'm Yae Publishing House's planner, the de facto organizer of the "This Novel Is Amazing!" event. We've met before.
Paimon: Paimon... kinda remembers...
Aratani: That's alright, I'm sure you'll remember me after this encounter.
Aratani: After all, with this new experience, I'll be able to inject some incredible, never-before-seen creativity into Yae Publishing House's next event! I'll become a renowned planner... Ahh, I truly am spectacular!
Traveler: About your travel itinerary...
Aratani: Right, the plan is to visit as many famous spots as possible.
Aratani: I hear there are quite a few scenic places inhabited by all sorts of fantastic animals here in Sumeru, where inquisitive researchers and noble Forest Rangers alike come and go, along with those mysterious, dangerous, yet alluring mercenaries.
Aratani: Writers should be able to find inspiration around every corner here.
Aratani: I recommended that Lady Yae bring more writers here to gather materials for their work, but she replied, "Quality is far more important than quantity," and selected Souka at random after flipping through the list.
Aratani: In truth, Souka hasn't published any successful pieces yet. But I added her to our backup roster because of her great writing skills and her ability to quickly become immersed in stories.
Paimon: Hmm... so that's how Souka was selected... It does feel a little random, to be honest... But it fits Miko's style.
Traveler: Maybe Miko wants to try to personally train someone new.
Aratani: Wow! That's a really accurate guess!
Aratani: Lady Yae once said, "To discover a newcomer's potential while heading in the most interesting direction should be a unique experience."
Aratani: Now, being that senior writers mostly have their own writing style and habits, a newbie might have an advantage when it comes to incorporating foreign elements into a novel.
Aratani: Lady Yae is as insightful as ever! It would seem Souka really is the best candidate for the trip to Sumeru!
Traveler: About Yae Miko...
Aratani: Mhm, you guys are more concerned with the whereabouts of Lady Yae after all.
Aratani: Unfortunately, the schedule that Lady Yae put together for us only covers a few specific days. We're free to do as we wish in our free time.
Aratani: Take me, for instance. I'm thrilled just looking through the details of the Beast Tamers Tournament.
Aratani: As for what Lady Yae does during her free time... Well, that's personal. It's not something a planner like me would have the privilege of knowing.
Paimon: Well, come to think of it, Miko isn't someone who would enjoy a packed itinerary.
Traveler: Have a good time!
Aratani: You too! Good luck with your competition!

Aratani: That's amazing! Have you guys studied Fungi before? You two are beyond gifted if this is your first time. I mean, you guys just easily won three matches in a row!
Traveler: Congratulations to us.
Paimon: #Haha, Traveler really does pick up things almost instantly!
Paimon: If Miss Aratani were to join us on our adventures, you'd be able to experience all sorts of new stuff, but you'd also see that we often only have a short time to adapt to those new things!
Aratani: Really?
Aratani: I always thought that people like that only existed in Junkichi's outlandish novels... I see now that I was wrong!
Aratani: I won't make negative comments about Junkichi's "sudden increase in power" character trope ever again!
Traveler: Let's put that aside for now... Souka...
Paimon: Oh, right. Miss Aratani is here walking around... but where's Souka?
Aratani: Souka? She's feeling better. She said that she's planning the main arc of her new novel, but she still needs to find inspiration for the blanks in between the chapters...
Aratani: So she went to find a local familiar with the area and is now planning her next journey.
Traveler: That's good.
Paimon: Souka has overcome the negative emotions of her defeat. Whew... that takes a load off our shoulders.
Traveler: Isn't it the same with Miko?
Paimon: Yeah. Paimon hears that Miko would pound her opponents into the ground every single time! But knowing the way Miko does stuff, Paimon is sure she only showed a portion of her true power!
Aratani: Here it comes — this is the part where you start buttering each other up!
Aratani: Then my question would be "Then, who is the stronger one between the Traveler and Lady Yae?"
Aratani: I'm only asking about their combat skill in this competition. Assuming that the two of you were up against Lady Yae, who would win?
Paimon: Eh? How sudden! Paimon's drawing a blank...
Paimon: It's no good to say we don't know... but it'd be disrespectful to say that we'd beat Miko... If we were to admit defeat, we'd be too soft... How frustrating!
Traveler: There's no point in comparing combat abilities.
Paimon: Th—That's right! Paimon almost let Miss Aratani trap us! Miko said herself that she was just here for the experience. All she wanted to do was to try out beast taming. There's no need for a question like that.
Aratani: What a perfect answer! The "offend no one" strategy that presses the conversation forward with no way to turn back!
Aratani: Is it that obvious that you guys are the chosen "protagonists" of this world!? Hmm... I'm starting to get excited! What performances do the two of you have lined up for Souka's newest novel?
Paimon: Why is Miss Aratani acting so weird too? Has Souka passed her weirdness on to her...?
Traveler: What's important is that we can get along with our companions.
