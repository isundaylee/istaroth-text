I often travel during storms
Which means my eyes are often blinded by the rain
Many times, I couldn't even see what was right in front of me
One day, I finally reached the top of the mountain
I looked out with the clouds beneath my feet
And only the gentle breeze murmuring in my ears
The highest mountain is a clear and enlightened heart
Here, there is no self, no hatred, no regrets, and no desires
Let's embark on a journey, for I am the breeze
We will meet again, no matter how far along the road
Life has just begun, and maybe the whole world can be my home
