## Talk 1

Read: (The stone tablet has some intelligible words on it that say...)
Read: My father told me that everything we do should be backed up by morality and brought forth with elegance.
Read: That's why he said that I should use these words to record hints for my labyrinth.
Read: Only within Evernight will the mechanisms to the labyrinth walls and the way forward appear, bathed in invisible moonlight as they are.
Read: The mechanisms that control the solution to this labyrinth are hidden in its four corners.
Read: And because I lacked rhyme or rhetoric in my writing at the end...
Read: My father, Eurydates, gave me a few strokes on the backside with his crutches.

## Talk 2

Read: Now that I've added a lock on this labyrinth, that old man can't bother me about my writing anymore.
Read: A labyrinth is a labyrinth, and a maze is a maze. The word itself is derived from "labrys," the "double-bladed axe" â€” so of course it should be symmetrical!
Read: During Evernight, the two sides of this labyrinth become symmetrical, and so the way forward will become clear.
Read: It's pretty orthodox, but there's a little avant-garde in there too! "The one who finally solves the mystery will create the labyrinth." What a romantic notion!
Read: Such romanticism isn't something the old man, obsessed with rhetoric and rhyme as he is, would understand.
