Taliesin: #We meet again, golden-haired {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: Taliesin, have you come for a duel?
Paimon: Wait, what are you saying?
Taliesin: Haha, I'm here to get some inspiration, of course! Listen to this: the hero without a past, bereft of any clan, and their loyal fairy retainer!
Paimon: No idea who you're talking about.
Traveler: Yup. No idea here either.
Taliesin: Look, look! O modest hero, do not cast your perplexed gaze towards the distant mountains, for in this benighted land, you are the very light itself!
Paimon: Eh?
Traveler: What...?
Taliesin: I'm talking about you! In my current written template, of course.
Traveler: Ah...
Paimon: Huh, so this guy can actually say things we understand.
Traveler: See you.
Taliesin: #See you, gold-haired {NICKNAME}!
Traveler: What are you doing here?
