Traveler: Your uncle?
Moce: That's right! My uncle was in Sumeru before, but he came back in the last couple of days.
Moce: Dad says that Uncle didn't get anything done other than get himself into a bunch of debt before returning, but I bet that's a lie.
Moce: He just said that because he doesn't want me to leave town!
