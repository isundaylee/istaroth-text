Traveler: Nope.
Yolotli: Huh... I see...
Yolotli: Did I seem a bit nervous to you? Yeah, sorry about that.
Yolotli: Thing is, a message from Mr. Toltec often means a new commission to investigate the Ley Lines. But I'm afraid I'm not ready to go out there again quite yet.

Yolotli: My Ley Line perception is mediocre, so I need Saurian help for that â€” and Iktomisaurs aren't the type to just go out for walkies with humans.
