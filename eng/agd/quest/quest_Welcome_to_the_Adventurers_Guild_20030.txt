# Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild


## Talk 1

Katheryne: Welcome to the *Adventurers' Guild*. Actually, I have had my eye on you for a long time.
Paimon: #You've had your eye on Traveler, eh? Has he been causing some mischief?
Katheryne: Oh, that is not what I meant at all. Being on the lookout for great adventurers is part of my job.
Katheryne: When I look at you, I see one with the potential to rival the great adventurers of legends.
Paimon: Paimon sees it too.
Paimon: #Paimon always feels safe adventuring with Traveler.
Katheryne: Nevertheless, to the adventurer, experience is far more precious than potential.
Katheryne: You must accumulate *Adventure EXP* to increase your *Adventure Rank*.
Katheryne: Time is of the essence. Allow me to brief you onâ€”
Paimon: Wait! Are you saying we're like, official adventurers now?
Katheryne: Do not worry, the Adventurers' Guild does not charge a membership fee or impose any kind of duties on its members.
Katheryne: In short, there are lots of benefits but no drawbacks to becoming a member.
Traveler: Alright then...
Katheryne: Basically, the Adventurers' Guild rewards you every time your Adventure Rank increases.
Katheryne: Here is a new members' gift for you. You will need to return here to claim rewards in the future.
Traveler: Adventure Rank Rewards
Traveler: Gimme the benefits, now!
Katheryne: Haha... New recruits these days certainly do not beat around the bush.

## Talk 2

Katheryne: Without further ado, please allow me to officially welcome you, our new avid adventurer, into the Guild!
Katheryne: Here is your *Adventurer Handbook*.
Traveler: They have a handbook for that now!?
Katheryne: A new member coming aboard is a momentous occasion! A little ceremony is only fair.
Katheryne: It has a record of available commissions and rewards.
Katheryne: And it is also proof of your membership.
Katheryne: Oh, and one more thing.
Katheryne: Sometimes, you will find yourself stuck at a certain Adventure Rank.
Katheryne: When this happens, you need to perform some impressive feats to gain further recognition from the Guild.
Paimon: Impressive feats? Sounds like hazing to me.
Katheryne: They are simply specific adventures that allow you to ascend to the next Adventure Rank on completion. Ascension adventures, if you will.
Katheryne: But that will come later. Opportunities to win recognition will come as you gain more adventure experience.
Katheryne: That will do for today. We will have plenty of chances to meet again in the future.
Katheryne: Ad astra abyssosque, Adventurer! With effort, you shall reach the stars and conquer the abyss!
Traveler: This looks more like a marketing pamphlet...
Katheryne: It is, in a way. But it has some practical uses too.
