Traveler: What can you tell me about the resistance?
Yuuzou: I hear that Sangonomiya Kokomi, the commander of the resistance, is both wise and a master tactician.
Yuuzou: It was due to Her Excellency's amazing directives and the battle instincts of General Gorou that the Shogunate wasn't able to secure an advantage during the course of the battle.
Yuuzou: It's all thanks to them that the Sangonomiya troops have managed to make it to this day.
