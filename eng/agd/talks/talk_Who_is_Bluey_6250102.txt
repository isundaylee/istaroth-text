Traveler: Who is Bluey...?
Little Mao: Bluey is my friend! She's from the mountains. She plays with me and takes me to many fun places in the mountains. We eat lots of delicious fruits too, and she lets me touch little rabbits and little cats.
Little Mao: She's really nice and really cool! When she came out of the forest, the branches and vines clattered as they retreated automatically. When she took me to cross the river, the moss on the stones also crept away, returning only after the two of us had crossed the river.
Little Mao: But that's not all! Hmm... the birds and snakes also follow her instructions. I accidentally lost my things several times, and Bluey asked the birds to find them in the forest for me.
