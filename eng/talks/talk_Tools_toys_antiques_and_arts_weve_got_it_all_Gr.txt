Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Tools toys antiques and arts, we've got it all! Groceries, household essentials, our competitors haven't got a prayer, so don't rush about and just use Damoville Purveyors!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "You guys sell Dandelion Wine?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "We currently do not have any of that item in stock, but we are happy to order it for you. We can handle everything on your behalf, so save yourself from rushing about and just leave it to us!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Great, send ten crates of Dandelion Wine to the Fortress of Meropide then."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Sorry, we don't offer delivery."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Didn't you say you'd save us from rushing about?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Our store reserves the Right of Final Interpretation of 'rush about,' and has stipulated that 'delivery' does not fall within the scope of 'rushing about.'"
