# Chronic Illness


## Talk 1

Tighnari: Ah, it's you two. I was just about to go look for you.
Paimon: Huh? Tighnari, what're you doing here? Where's Collei?
Tighnari: I came to check on Collei's condition. To put it simply, she's not well.
Paimon: You mean she's sick? How could she be... Oh, wait a minute, could it be because of what Paimon did yesterday?
Tighnari: No, no need to worry. Something as small as you could never harm her. This sickness is something that Collei has been dealing with for some time.
Tighnari: Collei has been more excited than usual since you two arrived — a little too much so, to be honest. She hasn't remembered to take care of herself.
Tighnari: *sigh* I suppose it's understandable, though. She hasn't been around anyone she considered a friend for some time now. It must have been refreshing for her to have you two here.
Paimon: So, Tighnari, what's really wrong with Collei...?
Tighnari: Ahem, let's take this conversation elsewhere. Collei just fell asleep after taking her medicine. She needs some peace and quiet.

## Talk 2

Tighnari: Alright, let's continue our conversation here, shall we?
Tighnari: To be honest, I hadn't realized you're that Honorary Knight from Mondstadt until Collei told me just now. I've also heard all about your deeds in Liyue and Inazuma.
Tighnari: So just to clarify, what I'm about to tell you about Collei is not because of who you are or your past feats. Instead, I am going to tell you because...
Tighnari: Well, because Collei asked me to.
Tighnari: And honestly speaking, I was against Collei revealing her past to you.
Tighnari: But, she insisted, saying you two treated her with sincerity and as a friend. So now she wishes to reciprocate the gesture.
Paimon: So Tighnari, what exactly is wrong with Collei? You said this is something she's been dealing with for some time. Just how serious is it?
Tighnari: Right, ever since she was a child, she's been afflicted with a disease called Eleazar.
Paimon: Eleazar?
Tighnari: Yes, it's a disease unique to the lands of Sumeru. It is characterized by dark and hardened scales that form on the body.
Tighnari: At first, the afflicted may only feel mild numbness on affected areas of the skin. However, as the disease progresses, one may begin feeling fatigued and even experience peripheral paresthesia.
Tighnari: In its final stages, the disease strips a person of the ability to control their own body, and they effectively become completely immobile.
Paimon: That sounds terrifying!
Traveler: They'll lose all control over their body!?
Paimon: Wait, hold on! So when Collei seemed to be acting a little clumsy earlier, it was because...
Tighnari: Correct. That would be the effects of Eleazar, which is precisely why I do not want her carrying or holding anything, lest she ends up hurting herself.
Traveler: So is there any cure for Eleazar?
Tighnari: With appropriate treatment, the disease can be effectively controlled before it progresses to a more serious stage. However, there is, unfortunately, still no true cure for Eleazar.
Tighnari: Nevertheless, Collei's mother still hoped that there was something out there. She handed Collei over to an organization known as the Fatui after one of their members lied and said they had a cure.
Paimon: What? The Fatui!?
Tighnari: Ah, it appears you already are familiar with them. That'll save me some explanation.
Tighnari: Anyway, the person who eventually rescued Collei and brought her to me for care said that she had been given to a Harbinger known as "The Doctor."
Tighnari: I have no idea how this "Doctor" managed to do it, but her case of Eleazar was completely stable for all the years that Collei was with them.
Tighnari: However, Collei's days with the Fatui were anything but pleasant.
Tighnari: Collei is a resilient individual and always tries to appear cheerful, but her experience with the Fatui has left deep scars. Even now, she can still feel deathly afraid of someone touching her.
Paimon: Aw, Paimon had no idea Collei's been through so much suffering...
Tighnari: Oh, by the way, Paimon, Collei wanted me to tell you that she's sorry for scaring you yesterday. She also wanted both of you to know that she's sorry for hiding her illness.
Paimon: She doesn't need to apologize. None of this is her fault at all!
Tighnari: Well said. I hope you'll get a chance to tell her that in person the next time you see her.
Tighnari: Collei once thought that it would be impossible for her to have any real friendships... I trust that you two will never let my trainee experience such emotional pain again.
Paimon: Don't worry, Tighnari! We'll take good care of her!
Traveler: How's Collei's condition now?
Tighnari: Well, it's not too serious at this point. She over-exerted herself the last couple of days, which is what led to her break down this time. As long as she has taken her medicine and gets plenty of rest, she should get better.
Tighnari: Though, I must admit that Collei's condition was much more stable when she first arrived here in Gandharva Ville.
Tighnari: She was interested in the work of the Forest Rangers the moment she saw us. I could see that she was serious about learning, so I felt compelled to ask her to join us.
Tighnari: Her stamina has gotten much worse recently. Though a moderate amount of physical exercise is always necessary, I'm afraid the long-distance patrols are a little too much for her now.
Tighnari: Alright, now that I've told you about Collei's past, I think I'll head into the rainforest to find some ingredients needed for her medicine. I'll see you two later.
Traveler: Wait, can we come along?
Paimon: Yeah! We'd like to do something to help Collei, too!
Tighnari: Alright, but I must warn you two, the rainforest is a dangerous place, especially for someone who's still recovering, like the Traveler. You must follow closely and listen to every instruction.
Paimon: No problemo!
Tighnari: Let's go then. We'll be looking for a plant known as the Nilotpala Lotus. It's often used to help those afflicted with Eleazar recover their energy.

## Talk 3

Tighnari: There should be Nilotpala Lotuses growing somewhere in this area. Let's split up and begin searching.
Tighnari: If you could manage to gather four of them, that would be sufficient.
Tighnari: We'll rendezvous here once you've gathered the needed amount.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Hey Tighnari, we found the lotuses you requested.
Tighnari: Let me take a look... Hmm, good, very good. These are all excellent quality.
Tighnari: I'm glad you two came along, your exploration experience helped save me a lot of time here. It seems we even have enough time to stock up on other things I need...
Amir: Hey! Tighnari!
Paimon: Oh, Tighnari, someone's calling your name. They're dressed like a forest ranger.
Tighnari: Ah, yes, that's Amir and the others. But didn't they just set off not too long ago? What are they doing back so early?
Tighnari: Let's go find out what's going on.

## Talk 5

Amir: Tighnari, thank goodness we found you here. We were just about to head back and find you at Gandharva Ville.
Tighnari: What's going on?
Nasrin: We just discovered a Withering Zone.
Tighnari: The Withering is back!? But the patrol route you were on should have been already cleared just a week ago. It reappeared so quickly...
Tighnari: Can you tell me the exact location?
Amir: It's up ahead, deep in the river valley. It's appeared in a spot that blocks nearly the entire narrow part of the valley area, so we decided to come find you as quickly as possible.
Tighnari: And the radius of the contamination?
Amir: Sorry, I couldn't get a clear enough view to tell.
Nasrin: No one in our patrol team had a Vision, and it appeared to still be spreading, so we didn't risk getting any closer.
Tighnari: #Okay, I understand. You made the right decision. I'll go deal with it right away. In the meantime, please guide {M#these two}{F#these two} back to Gandharva Ville.
Paimon: Wait, Tighnari! Why don't you let us help you?
Amir: You two have only just arrived in Sumeru. You're still unfamiliar with many things in these lands.
Amir: There's a unique type of anomaly that occurs in the Sumeru rainforest. It's called "The Withering."
Amir: The affected areas not only cause nearby vegetation to wither, but it's also lethal to wildlife and even people. If you don't carry a Vision, then you should think twice before approaching such places.
Tighnari: Yes, Amir is absolutely right. I wasn't kidding when I said the rainforest is a dangerous place.
Tighnari: As Amir said, only someone with a Vision — that is, the power to manipulate elements — will be able to resist The Withering's corrosive effects for a time.
Amir: That's right. If any of the Forest Rangers without a Vision come across a Withering Zone, we first make a record of the location and then have a ranger with the proper abilities deal with it, like Tighnari here.
Amir: Only someone with a Vision can venture within a Withering Zone and find a way to deal with it.
Traveler: I might be able to help with this.
Amir: But, you don't seem to carry a Vision...
Paimon: #Don't worry, {M#he}{F#she} may not have a Vision, but {M#he}{F#she}'s a real pro at using the power of the elements.
Traveler: I can also control the elements.

## Talk 6

Tighnari: Hmm, it seems the rumors about you are true then. In that case... Alright, you two may accompany me.
Tighnari: We typically only teach visitors how to identify The Withering as they're about to leave Gandharva Ville. We'll make an exception today and show you what it looks like up close.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Don't sweat it, we've helped others deal with similar situations before.
Tighnari: Wait, you've met other Forest Rangers before? I was planning to properly show you both how to identify The Withering before you left Gandharva Ville.
Tighnari: Anyway, since you two are experienced adventurers, come with me, I'm sure you'll both be able to help.

## Talk 8

Tighnari: Stop, don't move any further. Look there, in the distance.
Paimon: Huh, where? Oh! Look, those plants have withered... That whole area is kinda gloomy. Even the air looks like it's filled with ash.
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon doesn't like the look of this.
Tighnari: That is The Withering.
Tighnari: Alright, Traveler, we're going to have to enter that Withering Zone. Once inside, we'll need to look for what we call Tumors of The Withering. If we eliminate those, then the area will be saved.
Traveler: Gotcha, let's do this.
Tighnari: Thank you. But I must warn you, don't push yourself. This is your first time handling this sort of thing, after all.
Tighnari: Even with elemental powers, once you step inside the Withering Zone, you may experience extreme discomfort. If at any point it becomes too much, return outside the zone and take a breather. It could become a matter of life and death.
Tighnari: You ready, then? Let's go!

## Talk 9

Paimon: Hey, look! That gloomy area over there looks like a Withering Zone.
Paimon: Even though Paimon's seen one before, it's still kinda scary...
Tighnari: Alright Traveler, we're about to enter the Withering Zone. Since you already have experience dealing with these things, you should already know what to do.
Tighnari: But please remember, don't push yourself. If at any point it becomes too much, return outside the zone and take a breather. It could become a matter of life and death.
Tighnari: You ready, then? Let's go!

## Talk 10

Paimon: We did it! Everything's returning to normal now!
Tighnari: Yes, thanks to you two, we were able to quickly restore this area back to normal...
Paimon: Um, Tighnari? You make it sound like we did well, but why does Paimon have the feeling you're worried about something?
Tighnari: It's that obvious, huh? Alright, it's like this...
Tighnari: Recently, the rate at which Withering Zones appear has been increasing. Even though we were able to quickly clear that Withering Zone, it won't be long before another one appears.
Tighnari: If that simply meant more work for me, then that wouldn't be an issue... But it's far more severe than that. The Withering is leaving lasting effects on the rainforest itself.
Tighnari: For instance, even though we cleared out the Withering Zone, many of the plants that were affected will not recover.
Tighnari: This presents a crisis for the ecosystem itself. Many plants in the rainforest are already in decline, directly impacting the wildlife that depends on those plants.
Tighnari: And most disturbingly... as the appearances of Withering Zones have started to increase, Collei's case of Eleazar has also become more serious.
Paimon: Huh? But why's that?
Tighnari: I'm still not sure of the exact reason. However, I've received word from acquaintances at the Akademiya that similar cases are being reported for patients with other conditions.
Traveler: Is there no way to permanently get rid of The Withering?
Tighnari: No, none that we know of. The Withering has been recorded in Sumeru for millennia. It's said that it originates from the depths of the world.
Tighnari: By the way, have you heard of Irminsul before?
Traveler: No, I haven't.
Tighnari: Irminsul is a tree located deep beneath the surface. Although it isn't like any tree we know in a biological sense, you can basically think of it as a large tree that grows downwards rather than upwards.
Tighnari: I'm sure you've heard of Ley Lines, right? They're like the roots of Irminsul, spreading and extending from a massive cavern deep underground all the way up to the surface.
Traveler: (Spreading and extending, a massive cavern... Sounds a lot like what I saw when I lost consciousness in the cave.)
Tighnari: Ley Lines continually absorb the memories of this world, which are then funneled into Irminsul, allowing it to collect knowledge and wisdom from ancient times to present day.
Tighnari: The Dendro Archon is known as the God of Wisdom because her consciousness is directly connected to it. It is also said that the Dendro Archon's power is a manifestation of Irminsul.
Tighnari: And as for The Withering, its emergence is related to a disease that's affecting it.
Traveler: Huh? You mean Irminsul is sick?
Tighnari: That's right. My ancestors learned of this from Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's familiars a long time ago, but even those mysterious creatures did not know of a cure for Irminsul.
Tighnari: I'm afraid we rangers will be battling the Withering Zones here for a long time until a cure is found.
Tighnari: Alright, that's enough on this topic for the time being. Now that we've taken care of things here, it's time for us to head back to Gandharva Ville.
Traveler: I think I've heard it somewhere before.

## Talk 11

Amir: Oh, Tighnari, you all made it back! How did it go?
Tighnari: The Withering Zone you reported has been taken care of. No need to worry.
Tighnari: Huh? Wait, is that...?
Tighnari: Oh no! Haypasia!
Paimon: Huh? What's wrong, Tighnari?
Tighnari: This Dusk Bird is Haypasia's designated courier for urgent news. You do remember her, don't you? She's the scholar you and Paimon were following when you first arrived in Sumeru.
Paimon: Oh, her! How could we forget! Uh, so did something happen?
Tighnari: Let me see what's written in the letter first. Uh...
Paimon: So, what's it say? And what's with that weird expression on your face? Ugh, just let Paimon read it...
Paimon: Huh? Uh, all Paimon sees are three squiggly lines...
Tighnari: *sigh* Yes, allow me to explain. After we brought you from Haypasia's cave to Gandharva Ville, Haypasia resumed her meditation.
Tighnari: She must have just finished. It's been nearly three days since she's had anything to eat, and it appears she's forgotten to prepare some rations. This letter is her asking us for help, we need to go.
Paimon: What? You mean she's been sitting there for three days!? Hey wait, how did you know all that from just a few lines on the paper?
Tighnari: Well, obviously because this has happened before... Last time she drew five lines, and by the time we found her... Ahem, well, I'd prefer not to remember that.
Tighnari: Needless to say, Haypasia's been through worse, but we should still get to her as quickly as possible.
Tighnari: I've got some emergency rations set aside for times like these. Paimon, Traveler, could you two bring these to her?
Paimon: #Wait, you want us to bring her the rations? But will {NICKNAME} be okay if her cave is still filled with that funny incense?
Tighnari: #Let's find out. Here, {NICKNAME}, take a smell and see.
Tighnari: So, how do you feel?
Traveler: Hmm, it's a light and refreshing fragrance.
Paimon: Huh? Really? You're not feeling even a little drowsy?
Paimon: #But wait, how'd you know that {M#he}{F#she}'d be okay this time, Tighnari?
Tighnari: #Back when we were clearing the Withering Zone, I observed that {M#he}{F#she} could adeptly manipulate the Dendro element. I knew then that {M#he}{F#she} would be fine.
Tighnari: #{NICKNAME}, and if I may ask, when I was telling you two about Irminsul's Ley Lines, was what I described similar at all to what you saw when you were unconscious?
Traveler: What I saw weren't hallucinations, were they?
Tighnari: That's correct, those weren't hallucinations at all, though I don't intend to apologize for deceiving you...
Tighnari: Because what you saw is of significant importance, not just for the nation of Sumeru, but the entire world of Teyvat.
Tighnari: My forefathers were shown much favor by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. We took an oath to protect this nation together with her. Now that that duty has fallen to me, it was a part of my responsibilities to ascertain whether you could be entrusted with the fate of Sumeru.
Tighnari: Now, after seeing you in action with my own eyes, you have earned my confidence, and I no longer feel the need to hide any secrets from you.
Traveler: So what exactly was it that I saw?
Tighnari: When you passed out, your consciousness had connected directly with Irminsul. What you witnessed were actually real memories contained within Irminsul itself.
Tighnari: I could try to tell you more, but it would be better if you went to ask Haypasia instead. Her focus on meditation and use of Spirit Borneol are aimed at establishing a connection with Irminsul, just as you did.
Paimon: Uh, that sounds nice and all, but will she really help us? Seriously, she completely ignored us the last time we tried talking to her!
Tighnari: That was because when you ran into her, she was in a special phase of her training. During that time, she must avoid communicating with others.
Tighnari: Please, wait here for a moment.
Black Screen Text: Tighnari leaves for a few moments...
Tighnari: Here, take these. It's a meal I packed for Haypasia, as well as some other ingredients. I'm sure it'll come in handy.
Tighnari: Also, here's a letter that I would like you to give to her. Just show it to her, and she'll answer any questions you may have.
Traveler: Thank you.
Tighnari: No, I should be the one thanking you. You've both been a great help these last few days.
Traveler: No unusual feelings this time.
