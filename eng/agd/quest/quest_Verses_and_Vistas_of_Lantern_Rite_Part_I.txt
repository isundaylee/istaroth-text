# Verses and Vistas of Lantern Rite (Part I)


## Talk 1

Vermeer: No this isn't right, and that's not right either...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Vermeer: Oh, hello. I'm just here collecting some materials.
Vermeer: Given that the Lantern Rite festival is already in full swing, I was thinking about how I could create a painting that depicts Liyue Harbor during the festival.
Vermeer: *sigh* Maybe it's a problem with my technique or something, but no matter what I do, the painting just doesn't feel right.
Vermeer: Maybe a change of scenery would give me more inspiration, but I can't seem to find anywhere better...
Vermeer: Traveler, do you know of any scenic spots that would be suitable for painting?
Traveler: We'll have a look around!
Vermeer: Oh, good. Let's have a look together then. Maybe we'll be able to find a nice scenic spot.

## Talk 2

Vermeer: Now here's a good view of the landscape... Oh, who's this?
Qingzhou: My name is Qingzhou, my liege. I might add that I consider myself a poet, if I may be so bold. And you are...
Vermeer: Ah, so you're a poet? Haha. Well, I'm a painter and I'm looking for some scenic spots nearby to help give me some inspiration.
Qingzhou: Inspiration, you say? Why, this is quite a coincidence. I myself am also seeking a stroke of inspiration. May I be so bold as to ask the purpose for which you seek to be inspired?
Vermeer: Certainly. I intend to paint a scene of Liyue Harbor during the Lantern Rite. This traveler here was assisting me in my search for a suitable landscape.
Vermeer: And may I ask what you are seeking inspiration for?
Qingzhou: Yes, quite the coincidence indeed. I also intend to write a poem about Liyue Harbor during the Lantern Rite. I'm seeking inspiration, just as you are.
Vermeer: I see...
Qingzhou: Hmm...
Vermeer: Wouldn't a poem be a little too simple? How could an amazing festival like the Lantern Rite and Liyue Harbor itself possibly fit into a few lines of poetry?
Vermeer: Hah, if you ask me, only a great painting could properly capture the essence of the festival.
Qingzhou: A great painting, you say? Hehe, I fear that such a work would only be a waste of good brush and ink. A painting could never truly capture the subtle charm of the Lantern Rite and would fail to accurately render the spirit of Liyue.
Qingzhou: Furthermore, could the grandeur of a land as magnificent as Liyue ever possibly be captured in a painting?
Vermeer: Haha, I think a painting would be better.
Qingzhou: Hehe, and I think a poem would be better suited.
Traveler: Whoa, calm down you two.
Vermeer: Arguing like this won't solve anything. I propose we each create a work depicting Liyue Harbor during the Lantern Rite...
Vermeer: Once we've both finished our works, we can put them on display and invite someone to judge them. What do you say?
Qingzhou: Your proposition is acceptable. I shall await your presence at Wangshu Inn once you have completed your... painting. Then we shall entreat an impartial judge to critique our work.
Vermeer: Good, you have a deal.
Qingzhou: It's settled then. If you would excuse me, I shall take my leave now.
Vermeer: He sure does talk big for a poet. And to think he actually believes that the Lantern Rite and Liyue Harbor can be expressed with a few lines of poetry, hah!
Vermeer: I'll show him! He won't even stand a chance once I finish my painting.
Vermeer: I'll need to pour all my creativity into this one. In fact, I should even specially prepare some paints and brushes for this particular piece.
Vermeer: Traveler, could I trouble you to help me collect some special materials?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Vermeer: Good, I'm counting on you. Now let me think...
Vermeer: Oh, I'll need you to collect Whopperflower Nectar from a Pyro Whopperflower.
Vermeer: With that, I'll be able to make mix some special paint.
Traveler: What kind of materials do you need?

## Talk 3

Vermeer: So, were you able to get the Whopperflower Nectar I need?
Traveler: Here it is.
Vermeer: Let me see here. Oh, here we go... Yes, this will do just fine.
Vermeer: Once the paint is ready, all we'll need to do is find a suitable landscape and then I can start painting.
Vermeer: Humph, just wait until that poet sees my painting...
Vermeer: Ah, I've just remembered! It's a tradition to release Xiao Lanterns during Liyue's Lantern Rite. People even write wishes on the lanterns, right?
Vermeer: Hehehe, I've even prepared a Xiao Lantern here, and as for the wish... Well, I won't tell you, otherwise it might not come true.
Vermeer: Oh, I nearly forgot, these are for you. I guess you could consider them your reward. Thanks for the help!
Vermeer: I can't wait to see the look on that poet's face when he sees my painting.

Vermeer: Hmph, my painting will leave that poet in tears of amazement.
