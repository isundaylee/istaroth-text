Traveler: About the Moonchase Festival...
Madame Ping: The meaning of the Festival in ages past was quite different. It was about the ancients of Liyue seeking the adeptal path.
Madame Ping: Nowadays, it's more about admiring the moon, eating, and enjoying our time together with one another.
Madame Ping: The meaning of festivals will shift with time, and some traditions will be forgotten. However, everyone's hopes for the future will remain the same, no matter what the day or age.
