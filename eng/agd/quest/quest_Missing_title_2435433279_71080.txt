## Talk 6

Taliesin: Thank you for helping me finish this epic poem... Ah, yes. Please, take this copy of my manuscript as thanks!
Taliesin: Phew... This epic manuscript carries both my emotions and ambitions. Please, take it. It is what little I can do to repay you.

## Talk 7

Taliesin: This might seem a little sudden, good hero, but could you spare a moment to tell me a story or two of yours for me to turn into songs for those who come after?
Traveler: Well, if you just need me to tell you stories...
Taliesin: I would be most grateful if you were to agree! Well then, fire away! I'm listening.
Traveler: I've got a ton of stories to tell.

## Talk 8

Traveler: Tell of the darkness and the creatures from the Abyss...
Black Screen Text: You tell Taliesin of the things that happened...
Taliesin: My, oh my. This is great. This is perfect! Give me a moment, let me write it all down.
Taliesin: "The dark fog pressed in like an avalanche, and the two apostles of the Abyss, now separated, disappeared without a trace, just as they had appeared..."

## Talk 9

Traveler: Tell of how you dispelled the Seven-Star Array...
Black Screen Text: You tell Taliesin of the things that happened...
Taliesin: Huh... "And so, with the aid of a faithful servant"... Wait. No, that won't do.
Taliesin: #"With the aid of a faithful friend, Traveler breached the path leading to the mines!"
Paimon: Uh... Is this really okay? We didn't ask her permission to use her in the story...
Taliesin: Ah, fret not, fret not! Heroes do not act as ordinary people might, and are not bound by such banal rules! Nobody will mind!

Black Screen Text: You tell Taliesin of the things that happened...
Taliesin: "The skies and the waters alike flowed across the crystal's surface, and the purple and red splotches faded..."
Taliesin: #"The ancient creature of the ruins reeled, having taken a blow from Traveler's iron fist, and it was at this moment that the star of the show arrived!"
Taliesin: "...The mysterious ally that came to the Traveler's aid had vanished without a trace, but the giant construct serpent had already been shattered to pieces by the crystal..."

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: Tell of the fluorescent fungi in the caves...
Black Screen Text: You tell Taliesin of the things that happened...
Taliesin: Fascinating... Almost unthinkable, really... Let me think for a moment before I say anything.
Taliesin: "And though it be a giant mushroom towering unto the sky, it was helpless before the encroaching dark..."
Taliesin: #"Answering the call, Traveler came forth, purifying the land and staving the crisis off..."

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: Tell of the nine Black Serpent Knights...
Black Screen Text: You tell Taliesin of the things that happened...
Taliesin: This... This is wonderful! "And so, the fated Traveler said: 'Forget coming at me one by one. I could take all nine of you on at once!'"
Traveler: Uh, that's a bit of an exaggeration...
Taliesin: It's alright... Now, if you'll allow me, I might exercise some creative license with the former lives of those nine swordsmen...

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: Tell of your search for your kin...
Black Screen Text: You tell Taliesin of the things that happened...
Taliesin: That is... fascinating indeed. An ancient, forgotten land, sacrifices that went unacknowledged, and an unjust punishment to fall into folly... What huge themes! What an expansive tale!
Taliesin: And to think that such stories are things that you've encountered in your travels, and that are so very close to your own aims...
Taliesin: Thank you for sharing all these with me. I will record them down. That said, I don't believe that I shall compose a poem from them yet... I believe that these will only be small fragments of your saga.
Taliesin: I will not tell your tale with the limited skill that I have... I ask only that you tell me of your journey once it is complete.
Taliesin: My intuition tells me that when that day comes, my ears shall be blessed with the most heroic tale known to this world.

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: Tell of the Fatui who met with a crisis...
Black Screen Text: You tell Taliesin of the things that happened...
Taliesin: Haha! That's such an interesting story! "'A bitter day this is, that we should be saved by our great foe!' Sergeant Anton exclaimed with a sigh..."
Taliesin: "Yet those who meet as friends today, tomorrow may meet as foes."
