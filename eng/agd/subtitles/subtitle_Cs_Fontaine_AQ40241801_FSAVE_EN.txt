In the end, the people will all be dissolved into the waters
And only Furina will remain
Weeping on her throne...
Only then
Will the sins of the people of Fontaine be washed away
Hey! Help! Over here!
All hands, initiate emergency rescue!
Hurry!
Hey, lend a hand!
Look! The water's receding!
We didn't dissolve
The prophecy was wrong! The prophecy was wrong!
The prophecy...
Was wrong?
