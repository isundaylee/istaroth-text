Traveler: Sorry... Just take care of yourself, alright?
Shinozuka: Huh? You're not a ghost? Whew... Thanks for the reminder, but please don't scare me like that again.

Shinozuka: It has an eerie feel to it, can you teach it to me? Maybe I can find some inspiration if I sing it while I'm writing my novel.
