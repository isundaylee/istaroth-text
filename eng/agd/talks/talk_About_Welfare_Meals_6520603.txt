Traveler: About Welfare Meals...
Wolsey: They aren't just free. They also provide unexpected surprises to liven up our monotonous lives. Great, huh?
Wolsey: Although according to feedback surveys, people have been asking for more variety, and to increase the ratio of delicious meals...
Wolsey: And some people want a points system. Eat five bad meals in a row, get one good meal of your choice, that kind of thing...
Wolsey: But behind every bad meal, there's a chef who made that meal. And I think we should give those chefs and their subpar cooking a chance.
Wolsey: So as for those suggestions... I'll have to think on it a bit more.
