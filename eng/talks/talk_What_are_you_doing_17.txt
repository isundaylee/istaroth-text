Traveler: What are you doing?
Harry: I am gathering information on where monsters are stationed along this road. It'll help me better protect the merchants' route.
Harry: If the situation gets worse, intel like this will help me convince the Acting Grand Master that the Stormbearer Mountains area is in dire need of a cleanup operation!
Harry: Just like the Grand Master's one, back in the day!
