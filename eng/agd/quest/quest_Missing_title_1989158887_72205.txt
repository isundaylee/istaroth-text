## Talk 1

Kito: Huh. Funny. I was sure I had it in my pocket...
Traveler: Hello there.
Kina: That won't do, we were supposed to pass them to Granny Una...
Kito: She's grown old and can't remember a ton of things clearly anymore. Recently, she's started going on about things that happened to her when she was young.
Kina: She's always going on about flowers this and flowers that... She even said that they were flowers from beyond the Sea of Fog, ones that looked both different and very pretty...
Kito: Then one day, I had a dream. I dreamed that the fog that covered the island disappeared with a single "woosh"! And there, on the other side of the ocean, stood a tall, huge, beautiful house. It wasn't made of wood... Or made of gold...
Kina: Me too, me too!
Kito: In that dream, I scaled high mountains and climbed great trees, and gathered lots and lots of beautiful flowers. I'd never seen them in my life, but I knew that those were the ones Granny Una was looking before...
Kito: But the flowers were too heavy, so I fell from the tree. I fell and fell and fell... and then I woke up.
Kina: Hah! That'll teach you to be so greedy. I said we'd gotten enough of them already, but noooo, you didn't listen! And I ended up falling out of the tree together with you, too!
Kito: Well, our pockets are empty now, and the stuff's all gone... How are we going to face Granny Una like this?
Traveler: Any help required?

## Talk 2

Kito: Hello there!
Traveler: Hi!
Kito: Thanks for helping us get those flowers! Still, I've got to say that something's fishy around here...
Kina: Me too. I mean, it's odd, isn't it...
Kito: Every time we go to a different place, we always meet unhappy people... And no one can hear what anyone else is saying...
Kina: And every time we find a beautiful flower, pick it up, and put it in our bags, it goes missing super quick!
Traveler: Well, that's because...
Kito: Is that so... I don't really get it.
Kina: We need to leave?
Kito: That golden man did say something like that as well... But we can't go with him yet.
Kina: We've still got to bring Granny Una some beautiful flowers!
Traveler: It's time to leave, huh?
Traveler: You two seem quite energetic.

## Talk 3

Kito: Oh, you're back?
Traveler: Will these flowers do?

## Talk 4

Kito: Looks like we meet again!
Kina: Hello again!
Traveler: And hello to you too!
Kito: Yup, still here! By the way, do you know what this big rock is used for?
Kina: Hehe! Kito knows everything, don'cha know?
Traveler: I don't know.
Kito: I've heard Grandpa Mata say that this is a tombstone used to guide the spirits of the deceased. Lost, lingering spirits will be attracted to these big rocks, and so they'll wake up here.
Kito: And after they do, they'll wander the island looking for someone who can fulfill their wishes. Once they find that person, they'll grab onto them until their wishes are fulfilled and they can finally be taken away by the boatman...
Kito: Some of those spirits are nice... and some of them aren't that nice. And that's why those who pass by these big stones in the night have to loudly declare their name and clan!
Kito: After all, those who know who their ancestors can have way more confidence than some lonesome ghosts. Once they hear where you've come from, they'll slink off quietly and not bother you anymore!
Kito: Uh... Trouble is, you're an outsider, aren't you? I don't think you'll have any clan to announce...
Kina: Uh oh, that's true. What'll you do if you encounter a bad spirit?
Kito: ...Hehe, you know what? It'll be fine, 'cuz I'll protect you!
Kina: Right! That's right! I'll help scare those bad sprits away, too!
Traveler: What is it used for?
Traveler: Still here, huh?

## Talk 5

Kito: Yeah! Those are the ones! Wow-wee, they're just like the ones in my dream!
Kina: Thanks so much!
Kina: Kito, once we've gone to see Granny Una, let's head to the beach on the east side to play! You can see Shourai Shrine from over there, y'know!
Kito: It's Chirai Shrine, come on...

## Talk 6

Kito: Hey there, we meet again.
Kina: Kito doesn't feel like talking much today.
Traveler: Is something wrong?
Kito: It's... It's nothing. I'll play by myself today. Don't worry about it.
Kina: Well, would you look at that. He's sulking all by himself again.
Traveler: What happened?
Kina: C'mon, Kito, no need to get mad at an outsider...
Kito: ...
Kito: ...Sorry. I shouldn't have been mad at you.
Traveler: It's all good.
Kito: The golden man's bugging us to board the boat again... He talked about going to a shining golden place where there's no fog! I don't wanna go there! I wanna stay with Granny Una!
Kina: He doesn't play with us, and he never has anything interesting to say... He just keeps telling us to leave! He's so scary...
Kito: It's not as if we're not good at leaving or anything! We're just afraid that Granny Una will worry...
Traveler: Would you tell me what happened at least?
Traveler: Anything I can help with?
Traveler: You don't look all that happy.

## Talk 7

Kito: We can't leave yet...
Traveler: Are these the flowers you were looking for?

## Talk 8

Kito: Hello there!
Kina: Hey!
Traveler: Why hey there, Kito, Kina!
Kito: Thank you, but we won't need anything this time. We're leaving soon... We're going to the land without fog.
Kina: We're gonna go see the big, shiny, golden house, and we're gonna ride on a boat to get there!
Kito: But before we go, we still need to thank you... Also, could you please pass this to Granny Una for us?
Kina: Place this in her hand, and she'll stop worrying and come with us!
Kito: We're counting on you one last time!
Kina: Thank you so much.
Traveler: Still need any Sakura Blooms?

## Talk 9

Kito: Thanks! We'll bring these flowers back to Granny Una!
Kina: Hey, Kito, give me half!
Kito: Let's go to the other side of the mountain. There's some great places to play in the Autake Plains to the southwest!
Kina: Chise's gonna be so mad at us... But whatever, I wanna go too!
