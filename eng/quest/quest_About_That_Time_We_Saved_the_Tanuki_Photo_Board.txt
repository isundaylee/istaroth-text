# About That Time We Saved the Tanuki Photo Board


## Talk 1

Thoma: What a nice surprise meeting you guys here.
Traveler: What brings you here?
Thoma: Well, I heard that a certain well-known individual had made an appearance at the festival and taken quite a liking to the Tanuki photo board.
Thoma: Since the Yashiro Commission is the host of this festival, I felt I simply had to come and meet them in person.
Thoma: Red horns... If I'm not mistaken, you must be the esteemed Arataki Itto, leader of the widely renowned Arataki Gang, is that right?
Arataki Itto: Hahahahaha! Thoma, my bro, your eyes do not deceive you!
Arataki Itto: And you are the housekeeper extraordinaire of the Kamisato Clan! You're quite the celebrity yourself, you know.
Thoma: Well, I'm flattered, Itto. And it's nice to meet you too, bro.
Paimon: Whoa, there's a serious bromance developing here.
Thoma: I didn't expect to run into both Itto and the Traveler here.
Thoma: Speaking of which, I kind of count as the host here. So is anything wrong? Don't worry, you can tell me anything.
Paimon: It's all Itto! He wants to—
Arataki Itto: Ah, no no no, it's no big deal. We were just about to have a duel, and we're trying to think what format it should take.
Thoma: Oh... a duel...
Thoma: In that case, I have a suggestion. Since your duel is taking place at the Irodori Festival, why don't you have a volunteering competition?
Thoma: Then you can both do your part for the Irodori Festival while settling your duel at the same time. What do you think?
Arataki Itto: Volunteering competition? Hmm, sounds a little low-key. Not quite hard-core enough for the Arataki Gang...
Arataki Itto: #I give this idea an interest rating of two points. One for {NICKNAME}, one for Thoma.
Mamoru: Boss means, uh... two points out of a hundred.
Thoma: Haha, yeah, this job isn't the most high-stakes, that's for sure. It just takes a little patience and responsibility.
Thoma: Also, since it's volunteering, by definition there's no remuneration. All you'll get is this special-edition drink from Sailing Breeze as a small token of appreciation...
Thoma: On second thought, this is nowhere near enough for the prestigious Arataki Gang. I don't know what I was thinking.
Arataki Itto: Wait, wait, wait a sec... What was that part about the, uh, token of appreciation?
Thoma: Oh, it's just a special-edition drink produced by Yae Publishing House and Sailing Breeze. It's really nothing special.
Akira: Boss! That's the one!
Genta: If we take this gig, we'll get that drink!
Arataki Itto: Oh... so uh, Thoma, my bro, my guy, my dude, maybe I didn't explain properly. When I said two points, that's out of a total of two.
Arataki Itto: If there's one thing the Arataki Gang is known for, I kid you not, it's our patience and responsibility!
Arataki Itto: It's an awesome idea, totally hard-core. Practically tailor-made just for me! Hahahahaha!
Arataki Itto: #{NICKNAME}, let's do this for our duel, it'll be amazing! Whoever volunteers the hardest wins! What do you think?
Paimon: You didn't seem too interested in it just a second ago.
Traveler: There's actually no need for the duel after all.
Arataki Itto: Hey, this is the mighty Arataki "Above All, Bold-Blooded" Itto you're talking to here! I'm a say-what-I-mean, mean-what-I-say, might-sound-mean-but-I-say-it-anyway kinda guy. And I say, we're gonna have this duel!
Paimon: AKA, doesn't-want-people-to-know-he's-only-doing-it-for-the-drinks kinda guy.
Thoma: If it's decided, then allow me to take the role of your judge.
Thoma: The volunteer work is simple. You just need to give your help to people who need it during the festival.
Thoma: I will assign some job requests that I've already received to you.
Thoma: If you're ready, we can begin.
Traveler: If you want that drink, just ask Thoma.

## Talk 2

Kimura: So many complaints... What should I do?
Traveler: Need any help?
Kimura: Ah, are you the Traveler who my superiors said would come and help us out?
Kimura: You came at the perfect time. We're facing a small problem here.
Kimura: As you know, the Irodori Festival is underway.
Kimura: In addition to all the things on sale, there's a lot of free entertainment programs available.
Kimura: But today, we received numerous complaints that a group of people has been hogging the Tanuki photo board.
Kimura: They won't leave, so no one else gets to use it.
Kimura: *sigh* What a headache.
Traveler: Can't you drive them away?
Kimura: Well... we tried talking to them, but the original point of these entertainment facilities was to let people freely enjoy the festival.
Kimura: So in principle, it's open to everyone, and there's no time limit on usage.
Kimura: This means that as long as they haven't done anything technically illegal, even if they keep hogging it...
Kimura: ...there is nothing we can do.
Kimura: So, can you try negotiating with them for us?
Kimura: If these complaints can't be resolved, and Madam Kujou finds out...
Kimura: ...I'll lose my bonus this month for sure.
Paimon: Hogging a photo board, huh? We know who would do something like that...
Paimon: #Should we go and have a look, {NICKNAME}?
Kimura: Thank you so much! You'll find them by the Tanuki photo board just east of the square.
Traveler: Can't you arrest them?
Kimura: Uh... arrest them? Well, it would solve the immediate problem...
Kimura: But don't you think that if the Tenryou Commission starts arresting people without good cause, we'll soon have a bigger problem on our hands?
Kimura: The first thing we tried was negotiating with them. But ultimately, these facilities are open to everyone, and there's no time limit on usage.
Kimura: This means that as long as they haven't done anything technically illegal, even if they keep hogging it...
Kimura: ...there is nothing we can do.

## Talk 3

Hiraizumi: Are you the festival volunteers?
Hiraizumi: Great. I was just wondering what to do about these goods. It's been really busy lately, and all the workers at the port are swamped.
Hiraizumi: But I have to get all this fresh soy milk delivered to the warehouse as soon as possible. It'll go bad if it's left outside too long.
Hiraizumi: Can you please help me take it to the warehouse? My coworker, Takeuchi, will be waiting for you there. Thank you so much.

## Talk 4

Thoma: The volunteer work is simple. You just need to give your help to people who need it during the festival.
Thoma: I will assign some job requests that I've already received to you.

## Talk 5

Hiraizumi: I didn't expect the Irodori Festival to be so busy this time...

## Talk 6

Ishida: You've finished already? Wow, you work hard!
Ishida: You're wonderful people, all you volunteers. Thank you so much.

## Talk 7

Arataki Itto: Hey hey, Traveler, Paimon! What's happening!
Arataki Itto: You came here for the Irodori Festival, too? Oh, see, I knew it, great minds think alike, huh?
Arataki Itto: Hahahahaha!
Paimon: You're such a child.
Paimon: We're here to take care of a little problem.
Arataki Itto: Oh, oh right. Well, who's got a problem? The Arataki Gang considers it our born duty to help those in need!
Traveler: Who do you think?
Arataki Itto: Huh!?
Paimon: The Arataki Gang is the problem!
Paimon: The Tenryou Commission said you guys have been hogging the photo board and nobody else has had a chance to use it.
Arataki Itto: Oh... uh... well... no we haven't...
Traveler: They've received quite a few complaints.
Arataki Itto: Uhh... it's kind of a long story. Mamoru, you're up! Explain the situation to these good people!
Mamoru: Yes, Boss!
Mamoru: The story starts two months ago, when we first found out about the Irodori Festival...
Mamoru: As everyone knows, this is a festival all about showcasing culture, with books on all kinds of topics on display and for sale.
Mamoru: Our boss is very forward-thinking. He thought we should seize this golden opportunity to publish some material introducing the Arataki Gang and help craft a glorious public image.
Akira: He also said we can make some money out of it to support ourselves.
Arataki Itto: Ahem, heh... that wasn't the main reason, obviously...
Paimon: Of course that was your main reason!
Mamoru: At first, we had plenty of time. In two months, Boss planned to write 60 pages.
Akira: But one month in, and he'd written a grand total of one line.
Arataki Itto: Well, I mean... Come on, gotta make sure the quality is up to scratch...
Paimon: More like worst procrastinator ever!
Mamoru: So, we cut some of the planned content, and figured it would still be fine if we could put out 20 pages in the next month.
Akira: But the day after that, the boss got hold of this card game called Genius Invokation TCG. Everyone loved it.
Genta: It felt like we only played a few rounds, but before we knew it, half a month had gone by! I'm telling you, this game — it's pretty incredible.
Arataki Itto: Ahem... I was just gathering inspiration for my writing... What?
Paimon: Sure you were... Inspiration that has absolutely nothing to do with what you were writing about!
Mamoru: So then we only had two weeks left. No way was that gonna be enough time to publish a book.
Mamoru: Boss said we should just make a colorful flyer instead. That way, we'd only need to think of a slogan.
Paimon: That makes more sense. It shouldn't take too long to think of a slogan, right?
Mamoru: Yeah, it didn't take long at all. We came up with 30 slogans between us in just half a day.
Akira: But 30 was too many, and we couldn't agree with each other on which one to use. It took us a week to make the final decision.
Mamoru: That was when we realized we'd have to pay an expensive express fee for the printing, because there was so little time left.
Genta: And... we couldn't afford it!
Arataki Itto: You gotta take it slow if you wanna do something well. Pay an express fee, and they're gonna do a rush job, and then there's gonna be all sorts of problems...
Arataki Itto: The Arataki Gang only puts out the very best into the world! And that is why I decided to give up on that project.
Traveler: Sure.
Arataki Itto: That, yup, well said! You gotta do what keeps you happy, same goes for humans and oni alike.
Arataki Itto: And it's not every day you get to go to an Irodori Festival, right? So priority number one right now is enjoying ourselves to the max!
Paimon: And the way you chose to enjoy yourselves was... to commandeer a novelty photo board?
Mamoru: Um... so, at first, Boss brought us here to buy some drinks. He said there was some sort of Irodori Festival limited-edition soft drink available.
Arataki Itto: That's right, this ain't no ordinary drink either. It's a special-edition joint creation of Sailing Breeze and Yae Publishing House, as featured in the popular novel, "Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?"
Paimon: Uh... What?
Mamoru: But when we got to the festival, the staff wouldn't let us in because of our unusual outfits.
Mamoru: They said we had to show up looking like our normal selves before they'd let us in...
Genta: We'd invested a lot of time and money into the way we looked! And then they accuse us of spoiling the image of the city.
Mamoru: One thing led to another, and by the time we finally got to Sailing Breeze's booth, all the drinks were sold out.
Mamoru: We were pretty disappointed, but there was nothing we could do. Then we saw this photo board on the way back, Boss said we can't let the trip go to waste, so—
Paimon: So you decided to take over the whole area for your own use?
Arataki Itto: Haha... I beg to differ. It's public property, we didn't "commandeer" anything!
Arataki Itto: We're just making sure public resources get used to the max.
Akira: Yeah! Boss is right. We're the ones making the most out of this thing!
Genta: Never let a single moment in your life go to waste. That's our policy in the Arataki Gang, and we're out here making sure this photo board gets the most out of its lifespan, too!
Paimon: Oh, brother... what a noble cause...
Traveler: You could also go buy some books.
Mamoru: But we spent so much money on our appearance... We only had enough left for one of those drinks.
Mamoru: We don't have anywhere near enough to buy books.
Paimon: Well, you can't just take over this photo board for yourselves because it's free and you don't have any money. Other people have the right to use it, too.
Arataki Itto: I guess when you put it like that... I can kinda see where you're coming from.
Paimon: So come on! Let someone else have their turn, already!
Arataki Itto: Um... ummm...
Arataki Itto: But you know full well that the Arataki Gang has a reputation to uphold.
Arataki Itto: If I say I'm gonna make the most out of this board, then I have to live up to my words.
Arataki Itto: If we just scrap our plan like that, we'd be going against our word. A gang's gotta have integrity, or it does huge damage to your prestige!
Arataki Itto: That being said... we won't have to worry about any of that if we can settle this the Arataki way.
Paimon: "The Arataki way," huh? Paimon has a bad feeling about this.
Arataki Itto: So I, Arataki "Numero Uno" Itto, challenge you to an all-out, no-holds-barred, anything-goes duel!
Arataki Itto: If you win, I will leave this board alone.
Traveler: ...Wait, do you mean a beetle fight?
Arataki Itto: Beetle fighting is an awesome idea! Just so happens I caught myself a true beast of an Onikabuto the other day, I call it "Demon of Darkness"!
Arataki Itto: Unfortunately, I did not bring Demon of Darkness with me today... so...
Paimon: Whew, that's a relief...
Arataki Itto: So how are we gonna do this duel? Uh, let's think... Umm, this is a tough nut to crack, lemme think for a second...
Paimon: Hey, look, isn't that Thoma? Guess he's here for the festival, too.
Paimon: #Why don't we ask Thoma how to do this duel, {NICKNAME}? Paimon bets he'll have a ton of ideas.
Paimon: Thoma! Thoma!!! Over here!!!
Thoma: #Hey, {NICKNAME} and Paimon!
Traveler: Great! Let's have a beetle battle!
Traveler: Whatever makes you happy.
Traveler: Would you care to explain?
Traveler: You are the problem.

## Talk 8

Takeuchi: Ah, you must be the volunteers here to save the day.
Takeuchi: You must be tired. Put down the goods and have a rest.
Takeuchi: I heard the Yashiro Commission has arranged for Sailing Breeze to prepare some special drinks for the volunteers as a way of saying thank-you.
Takeuchi: Soy milk is actually one of the ingredients for the drink. It's freshly made every day!
Takeuchi: In fact, the last batch of soy milk we processed has just been sent over. You'll get to try it very soon.
Paimon: What!? So Sailing Breeze's special drink... has soy milk in it!?
Paimon: Itto won't be able to drink that!
Paimon: Hurry, we've gotta get to Sailing Breeze before he does...

## Talk 9

Ishida: I'm so grateful to have you helping out...

## Talk 10

Kid Kujirai: *crying* Where'd my Temari go?

## Talk 11

Ishida: Are you the volunteers? Perfect timing.
Ishida: As you can see, there's a lot of dust and dead leaves around my stand.
Ishida: I've just been so busy with my customers these past few days. I keep meaning to sweep up, but I just haven't found a spare moment...
Ishida: Can you help me clean up the place, please? Thank you so much!

## Talk 12

Ishida: I'm so grateful to have you helping out...

## Talk 13

Kid Kujirai: Did you find my Temari yet?

## Talk 14

Kid Kujirai: Great! Now I can play the Temari game again!
Kid Kujirai: #Thanks, {F#Miss}{M#Mister}!

## Talk 15

Kid Kujirai: #Hey, {F#Miss}{M#Mister}! Come and help me!
Paimon: Hey, Kujirai, fancy meeting you here at the festival. But we don't have time to play games with you right now.
Kid Kujirai: I'm not playing games! I'm in trouble!
Kid Kujirai: I heard they were selling a new kind of Temari at the festival, so I came to check it out...
Kid Kujirai: But I couldn't find it anywhere, and then I went and lost my current one...
Kid Kujirai: *sobbing* It's gotta be nearby. I still had it a moment ago...
Kid Kujirai: #Can you help me, {F#Miss}{M#Mister}?
Paimon: So basically, every time we run into you, we have to go Temari-hunting...

## Talk 16

Arataki Itto: Hahahaha! What took you so long? I've been here ages — completed my tasks a long time ago.
Arataki Itto: So there you have it, when volunteering's the name of the game, no one volunteers harder than Arataki Itto! Hahaha!
Arataki Itto: #You lose, I win, {NICKNAME}, and to the victor go the special-edition spoils....
Arataki Itto: Behold, the drink of champions, created by Sailing Breeze in collaboration with Yae Publishing House, and as featured in the popular work, "Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?"!
Arataki Itto: All this talk's making me thirsty — don't mind if I do! Hahahaha!
Arataki Itto: Drink of champions, it's time to come home!
Traveler: Wait! There are beans!
Black Screen Text: Glug, glug, ahhh... Itto downs the drink in one go.
Arataki Itto: Ahhhhhhhhhhhh! Wooh! That's the good stuff...
Arataki Itto: That was a mighty fine drink... Although maybe it was a little past its prime...
Mamoru: Boss, they said they think there might be, uh...
Akira: B—Beans in the drink!
Arataki Itto: Huh!?
Black Screen Text: A mighty figure falls to the ground.
Genta: Ah! The boss is down! The boss is down!
Mamoru: Quick! Get him to a doctor!
Thoma: What's wrong? Can't Arataki Itto drink soy products?
Akira: He's allergic to beans!
Thoma: Oh, my goodness... Okay! Quick, grab Itto and follow me. I'll get a doctor — I sure hope it's not too serious...
Thoma: #I'm sorry, {NICKNAME}. I didn't even consider this possibility. It was all my fault.
Thoma: Leave Itto to me. I'll make sure he stands again.
Thoma: Don't worry. I'll see you later.
Karpillia: So, your friend is allergic to beans. It's a very rare condition, though I have heard about it.
Karpillia: I'm so sorry that our drink caused such a problem. I feel terrible.
Karpillia: If you don't mind, please take this. This is a special drink formula with no soy milk.
Karpillia: I could see that your friend enjoyed this drink a lot. Although it tastes slightly different without the soy milk, I'm sure this version will be more suitable for your friend.
Karpillia: Please accept it, along with our sincere apologies.
Traveler: There are soybeans in the drink!
