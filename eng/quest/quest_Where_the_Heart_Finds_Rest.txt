# Where the Heart Finds Rest


## Talk 1

Paimon: Ningguang's little secretary! We've found all the materials!
Baiwen: Oh? Already?
Baiwen: All three of you found them together? Okay, I see.
Baiwen: The Wonder Cores and Adepti Sigils look good. It seems that we've found our winners.
Baiwen: #I hereby announce that the winners of this material procurement contest are {NICKNAME}, Yun Jin, and Beidou!
Hongfei: What? It's over already? I haven't even found the Plaustrite yet!
Changgui: I can't believe it...
Zhicheng: *sigh* So close, but so far...
Baiwen: I'd like to invite our three winners to please proceed to the Jade Chamber, where Lady Ningguang is waiting for you.
Paimon: Huh? Where's Beidou? She was right here.
Baiwen: Captain Beidou has some business to attend to. She will join later. Please come with me for now.
Paimon: Alright then, guess we'll head on up to the Jade Chamber first.
Paimon: This has been a long time coming! The last time we went up to the Jade Chamber was aaaages ago!

## Talk 2

Ningguang: You've made an exceptional contribution toward the building of the new Jade Chamber.
Ningguang: I will not forget this. I shall be sure to repay your kindness at an appropriate juncture.

## Talk 3

Yun Jin: "To act, one must first feel"...
Yun Jin: After our trip to Mt. Tianheng together, I felt much more in touch with the character today. I believe I was able to deliver a more profound performance because of it.
Yun Jin: Next time I have a new opera, may we study the character together again?

## Talk 4

Anshun: The fact we were able to complete the construction work on schedule is a testament to everyone's hard work.

## Talk 5

Changfeng: The Jade Chamber looks magnificent...

## Talk 6

Ningguang: Combine the Adepti Sigils with the Wonder Cores and insert them into the Jade Chamber's control compartment.
Ningguang: The construction of the new Jade Chamber is now officially complete. Once the tethers are released, it will soar into the sky.
Ningguang: Thank you all for your work. Now it is time for me to fulfill my promise.
Paimon: Yeah!
Ningguang: Ms. Yun, I've already heard something about the reason for your involvement. You are looking for a venue for your new opera, aren't you?
Yun Jin: That's right. Lady Ningguang, I would like to hear your opinion.
Ningguang: The unveiling of Ms. Yun's grand new opera surely requires a venue of equal grandeur. So what would you say if I proposed that we stage your first performance right here, in the newly built Jade Chamber?
Ningguang: The Jade Chamber offers a splendid panoramic view of the mountains and the bustling city. It is fitting for the finest performance to be hosted in the heavens... I can think of no better stage for you than here, Ms. Yun.
Yun Jin: Thank you, Lady Ningguang. Then I will prepare my props and other articles shortly. Please allow me to bring all these aboard the Jade Chamber.
Ningguang: You're quite welcome. It's truly what a good opera deserves.
Yun Jin: #{NICKNAME}, Shenhe, Paimon, I'll be leaving now. Do come and see my play when the time comes.
Ningguang: #You're next, {NICKNAME}. What is your question?
Ningguang: #I should clarify. I do not know your {F#brother's}{M#sister's} whereabouts. So please, don't waste your question on this matter.
Paimon: Wow... You're a mind-reader, Ningguang! Oh well, guess Paimon will ask a question then!
Ningguang: ...Managing a successful business is not as simple as you might think. Capital, connections, sensitivity to the trends, an instinct for what is a good opportunity... All of these traits are crucial.
Ningguang: If you want to know how to make money, I will honor our agreement and give you an answer. But that is not to say that it will work for you.
Paimon: Wow! Paimon hadn't even asked the question yet!
Ningguang: Your question was written all over your face. Now look, you've helped me rebuild the Jade Chamber, and I intend to repay you handsomely for it.
Ningguang: So I promise you that should you one day require financial assistance, you may seek employment here. I will pay you at the highest rate of remuneration.
Paimon: Great! So next time we run out of Mora, we just need to come to Ningguang!
Paimon: No more questions from us. Shenhe, you got a question?
Shenhe: Me?
Paimon: Yes! This was a group effort!
Shenhe: Thank you... But I don't have anything to ask.
Ningguang: Are you sure? This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I'd urge you not to squander it.
Paimon: Yeah, just don't waste it! Hold on a second, Paimon can probably think of another one...
Shenhe: Lady Ningguang... do you think I can ever fit in in Liyue Harbor?
Ningguang: Now that is an interesting question.
Ningguang: Liyue Harbor is very inclusive. As long as you respect the rules here, you will not be turned away.
Ningguang: So the key is whether or not you yourself can develop a sense of belonging in Liyue Harbor.
Shenhe: A sense of belonging?
Ningguang: Yes. To become fond of a place, to feel part of it... it always requires a reason.
Ningguang: Perhaps someone you've met or something you've experienced here. Or perhaps you enjoy the atmosphere of Liyue and you will become accustomed to it.
Ningguang: In short, everyone needs a reason to stay. I hope you can find yours soon.
Shenhe: ...I see.
Beidou: Hey, what's going on? I just went to see the fleet, I'm a little later than expected.
Paimon: Come on, Beidou, it's your turn! Do you have a question for Ningguang?
Beidou: Me? Nah, I ain't got any questions. She forced me to help out, so I figured I may as well get involved with the contest.
Beidou: Ningguang, don't forget what we talked about.
Beidou: It's not gonna be easy to deal with. I don't think my fleet can take it on their own.
Ningguang: Don't worry, I have made preparations. The wound dressings are ready and the Millelith have set up an ambush.
Beidou: Glad to hear it. Watch your back. Stay alert!
Paimon: Beidou, Ningguang, what are you talking about?
Ningguang: You'll see when the Jade Chamber ascends. However... it's not the most pleasant topic of conversation. Maybe it's better that you don't know.
Ningguang: When I first set foot in the Jade Chamber, I stood at the edge of the platform and looked down upon Liyue Harbor far below.
Ningguang: At that time, I dreamed that one day the Jade Chamber's shadow would be seen in all seven nations of Teyvat.
Ningguang: My wish has not changed to this very day. However, it is not only out of consideration for myself that I have built the Jade Chamber anew at this time.
Ningguang: I hope the Jade Chamber will always float in the skies above Liyue Harbor, bearing witness to the prosperity and peace of the human world...
Ningguang: ...and I hope that you can all witness it with me.
Ningguang: Let the ascension ceremony commence!

## Talk 7

Keqing: The Millelith's casualties are within the range we expected.
Keqing: But in hindsight, there were still flaws with our plan.
Keqing: If we'd had more time, we could have built a barrier here to absorb the impact of the waves.
Keqing: We must learn from this experience and never repeat the same mistakes again... We were fortunate to have your assistance this time. Thank you.

## Talk 8

Shenhe: ...
Traveler: Are you alright?
Shenhe: I'm just a little exhausted. Otherwise, fine.
Shenhe: I wanted to deal with it myself. I didn't expect you to follow me.
Shenhe: Don't worry. She's not coming back any time soon. After an injury like that, she'll likely seek refuge somewhere else.
Ningguang: How did things go underwater?
Shenhe: It's been dealt with. She was injured before entering the water. It didn't take too much effort to finish the job.
Ningguang: Good. So the crisis has been safely averted. When you visit the Jade Chamber in the future, you will be afforded generous treatment.
Zhengmao: Lady Ningguang, the fleet reports that the sea monster has left Guyun Stone Forest and the surrounding waters have returned to normal!
Ningguang: Thank you. How are the Millelith?
Zhengmao: Thanks to the medical supplies you prepared and Lady Keqing's command, our losses were minimal.
Zhengmao: Of course, we owe huge thanks to this young lady for her help.
Zhengmao: On behalf of the entire Millelith, thank you for your service.
Shenhe: I...
Traveler: Shenhe protected us.
Shenhe: Great. Then next time I watch Ms. Yun's opera, I'll be able to take the compliments.
Shenhe: I wasn't trying to be a hero, though. I just wanted to protect you.
Ningguang: Let the soldiers recuperate. But don't let your guard down â€” if she returns with a vengeance, we must be prepared.
Zhengmao: Yes, Ma'am!
Ningguang: You've been monitoring us for some time now. I trust you've reached a conclusion.
Cloud Retainer: Hmph. You wish to hear one's opinion? Well. Things would have hardly gone so smoothly had it not been for Shenhe.
Ningguang: That I do not deny. However, final victory was always going to be ours, even had things been a little more arduous.
Ningguang: If it came to it, I could always destroy another Jade Chamber.
Cloud Retainer: ...One has observed your adaptation of the Guizhong Ballista, and finds oneself compelled to admit that you have evidenced some degree of novel thinking.
Cloud Retainer: You have learned from past failures and prepared for this crisis in advance. This is considerable progress compared to the last time.
Cloud Retainer: Hence, on balance, one finds your performance during this trial satisfactory enough. But there will no doubt be further trials to come in the future. Do not suppose that one will not continue observing you hereafter.
Ningguang: While the position of Tianquan remains mine, I will always ensure Liyue's safety.
Cloud Retainer: Shenhe... One saw you secretly venture out from the mountains a few years ago, and noticed the air of dejection in which you returned.
Cloud Retainer: Hopefully, this trip to Liyue Harbor has been a different experience?
Shenhe: Yes. I can't explain it, but...
Shenhe: I feel happier than I expected.
Cloud Retainer: Good. Traveler, please take good care of Shenhe, she is a dear child.
Cloud Retainer: In fact, one has many fond memories of Shenhe's childhood that you may be interested to hear about...
Shenhe: There'll be no need for that.
Cloud Retainer: Oh? Hmph. They are all like this.
Cloud Retainer: Fine! Since you care not to listen, one shan't be telling you. One shall be going homeward now!
Ningguang: Please have a good rest. Come to the Jade Chamber when you have recovered your energy.
Ningguang: We must celebrate both the completion of the Jade Chamber and the fact that Liyue has weathered another crisis. This banquet must be the most spectacular ever.
Traveler: Just like the hero in the story.
Traveler: Are you okay?

## Talk 9

Paimon: Wow... Everyone's already seated!
Paimon: It's Paimon's first time attending a banquet in the Jade Chamber! The food here looks amazing!
Ningguang: All of you here are my distinguished guests. I am determined that each of you thoroughly enjoys yourself.
Ningguang: Those who don't drink alcohol, please help yourself to other beverages. Fine wine is a delight to the senses, but it is far from the only one. I trust you will find the marvelous view from the Jade Chamber to be an equally gratifying indulgence.
Yongye: Have you heard? Ms. Yun's going to be performing today.
Zhu Tao: Sure have, honestly, it's the main reason I'm here! I've never missed any of Ms. Yun's performances and I don't intend to start now.
Zhu Tao: I hear she's going to perform "The Divine Damsel of Devastation" today, the one written by her father. I've been so excited that I've barely slept the last few nights.
Shiyu: Hey, look, Ms. Yun is going on stage!
Yun Jin: What did you think? Personally, I thought I sang rather well.
Paimon: It was beautiful! Paimon wants to learn too!
Shenhe: It was wonderful. Also... Thank you.
Yun Jin: You're welcome. Thanks to you, The Divine Damsel of Devastation is a more nuanced tale than ever.
Yun Jin: The play has an ending, but life goes on. I believe you will find a way to fit in in Liyue Harbor.
Shenhe: Thank you. I think I've found the opportunity I needed to change.
Zhu Tao: Ms. Yun... *hic*... Here you are, great to see ya.
Zhu Tao: Huh? Hey, this young lady with the white hair looks like some kind of VIP. Yeah, that's it, like an adeptus.
Zhu Tao: #Wait, you're the girl from the opera, aren't you? The "divine damsel" herself! And look who else we have here, the illustrious {NICKNAME}! Well I'll be... this was definitely worth showing up for.
Zhu Tao: Lemme pull up a chair, alright? We'll all have a friendly chat, get better acquainted...
Shenhe: ...
Shenhe: Alternatively, you could leave us alone. That is, if you'd prefer to finish your drink via the orifice of your own choice...
Paimon: Uh-oh, this feels all too familiar... Shenhe's back to her old self again...
Traveler: It seems she still has a long way to go.
Zhu Tao: Hey! What are you doing?
Paimon: Calm down, Shenhe. Calm down...

## Talk 10

Leming: The construction work on the Jade Chamber is now complete. Once we install the Wonder Cores and the Adepti Sigils, we can let it rise to altitude.

## Talk 11

Shenhe: Now that I think about it, I'm glad Master sent me here to deliver the sigils. Otherwise, I wouldn't have had the chance to meet you.
Shenhe: I'm sure I have much to learn from you in the future.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Lizheng: I don't know about anyone else, but this has been a challenging project for me... Let's get a drink after work.

### Additional Talk 2

Siqin: I can't wait to see the Jade Chamber ascend!

### Additional Talk 3

Liang: Finally, we can relax a little. It's been quite stressful recently with so many people flocking here.
Liang: Fortunately, the construction here has gone off without a hitch. I can only hope the same is true for my comrades at Guyun Stone Forest.

### Additional Talk 4

Zhu Tao: More wine, more wine!

### Additional Talk 5

Yongye: Drinking and watching opera in the Jade Chamber... a rare and exquisite pleasure.

### Additional Talk 6

Shiyu: I wonder when I'll be able to build a Jade Chamber of my own? *sigh* It'll take a lot more wealth than I have now.
Shiyu: But hey, you've gotta dream big. Who knows, if I keep working at it... Maybe one day.

### Additional Talk 7

Keqing: Ah, Traveler, Paimon. I wasn't expecting to run into you out here at Guyun.
Keqing: What brings you here? You'll have to make it quick, I'm afraid, I really can't afford to chat for too long.
Traveler: What are you doing out here?
Keqing: As you can see, we're working on a construction project.
Keqing: Personally, I consider this project to be of greater importance than the Jade Chamber rebuild. That's why I'm here to supervise.
Keqing: I just hope we can complete it on schedule...
Traveler: What is this?
Keqing: A new type of Guizhong Ballista.
Keqing: Ningguang commissioned an expert to dismantle and study the Guizhong Ballista, and design an improved version based on the original.
Keqing: This design is a step down from the adepti's original Guizhong Ballista in terms of firing speed and power, but the good thing about it is that it can be mass-produced.
Keqing: It's also considerably easier to assemble and disassemble. This will allow for flexible deployment, whatever the location.
Keqing: I am confident it will prove very useful in dealing with future crises.

### Additional Talk 8

Qiqi: Oh, it's you.
Traveler: Qiqi! What are you doing here?
Qiqi: Seaside. Dangerous.
Qiqi: Qiqi is helping. With the evacuation.
Traveler: "Dangerous"?
Qiqi: Yes. Ningguang said there's something bad in the sea.
Qiqi: So she sent Qiqi, to evacuate everyone.
Qiqi: But, no one will listen to Qiqi. So instead, Qiqi is guarding this place.
Qiqi: If danger comes, Qiqi will protect everyone.
Qiqi: Don't go near the sea. It's too dangerous.
Traveler: "Evacuation"?
