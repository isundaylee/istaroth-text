Dear me
Aren't you cutting it rather close?
Miko
This was your doing...?
Now, now
Don't forget who taught you
How to place your consciousness in objects
Surely you don't think
Your ambition alone
Is enough to shake Ei's will? Do you?
Though you alone are here
They too have ambitions
Which they long since entrusted to you
Now then
Close your eyes
Abolish the Vision Hunt Decree
