Traveler: How do you like it here?
Freminet: Mhm.
Freminet: ...
Freminet: I mean, uh... Everything here is really nice. And I'm used to it now, so there's no need to worry about me.
Traveler: It's okay. You don't have to be so polite.
Freminet: Sorry...
Freminet: I'm just worried that if I just say everything on my mind, I might cause unnecessary misunderstandings.
Freminet: ...
Freminet: ...Alright, then in that case, I'll do as you ask...
Freminet: To tell you the truth, Iâ€”I'm actually a little homesick.
Freminet: Even though this place is really comfortable, and the environment here is flawless, I just... can't seem to get used to life here.
Freminet: This is nobody's problem but my own, so... Please don't think I'm upset with you, or unsatisfied about anything in this place.
Freminet: ...I hope you can forgive me.
Traveler: You can tell me how you really feel.
Freminet: Heh... Are you really sure about that?
