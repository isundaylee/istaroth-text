# Talk Dialog

Dvorak: Magnificent... Absolutely magnificent...
Traveler: You mean, the show?
Dvorak: Yes... When I heard the music coming from up in the clouds, I was so stunned, I could barely think or move.
Dvorak: I felt like it had a special kind of hold over me... Hmm, or maybe it was the adeptal power within the music?
Dvorak: And the ensemble at the end was truly sublime! I felt like I would have started to cry if I hadn't been one of the performers on the stage.
Traveler: What are your plans for the future?
Dvorak: Well, Lady Ningguang, the Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing, has invited me to visit her again at Yujing Terrace to discuss a long-term collaboration plan.
Dvorak: I do hope everything goes well, and that we have more opportunities to collaborate in the future.
Dvorak: The next time we have another performance, you'll have to come! I will save the best seat for you.
Traveler: About the "fairy lady"...
Dvorak: Haha... I have already given her my thanks in person.
Dvorak: This is what she said: "It is only natural to lend a hand when we see someone in distress. The wonderful music you brought to Liyue is worth far more than gratitude."
Dvorak: Truly, I felt so honored...
Dvorak: But I've also made a decision for myself: I will strive to create even more wonderful, original music for this era... our era!
Traveler: See ya.
Dvorak: #We couldn't have accomplished all of this without you, Traveler. Please accept my most heartfelt thanks again!
