Freki: *sigh* My brother is so pathetic. He doesn't even dare to eat any of the food that he ordered himself.
Freki: I've tried some of the food before, and that's just how it is!

## Talk

Freki: Do you dislike Liyue cuisine?
Freki: It's not that I dislike it, let's just say that I'm... disappointed.
Freki: Take Zhongyuan Chop Suey, for example. All the spices they use completely overwhelm the natural flavor of the ingredients. Apart from the powerful spicy and salty flavors, there is no taste of the actual ingredients.
Freki: I had anticipated that it would be a more shocking taste, but I didn't at all expect this.
Freki: We'll consult the Teyvat Travel Guide again to see where we should head next on our culinary journey.

## Talk

Freki: Goodbye.
Freki: Goodbye. We'll be heading out shortly ourselves.

Traveler: Have you seen somebody who looks similar to me?
Freki: Similar looking to you... a sibling, you mean? Not that I remember.
Freki: I understand how you must feel. If I were to get separated from my brother, I mean, if one of us wandered off and got lost or something, that would be... *sigh*
Freki: In any case, I will help you keep an eye out during your travels. May you find them soon.
