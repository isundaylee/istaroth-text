Traveler: So about the Moonchase Charms and treasure chests in Mondstadt...

## Talk

Linyang: Huh, so that's what you wanted to ask me about. Let me have a look, and I'll mark some of them out on the map for you...
Linyang: Still, I can't help you mark everything out. Guild rules, you know...?
Linyang: Also, I'm pretty sure Mondstadt is supposed to be under Cyrus's jurisdiction. Seriously, that guy...
Linyang: Well, I've marked them out. Have a look.

## Talk

Linyang: Hmm... Let me see... Actually, based on the number of chests and Moonchase Charms you've obtained...
Linyang: You've found all the treasure and charms that the Guild has placed in Mondstadt.
Linyang: If you're still up for a little more fun, why not pick another region to go treasure-hunting?

## Talk

Linyang: I've already marked some of them out for you. Go have a look at your map first.

## Talk

Linyang: Eh? You... you seem to have found all the treasure chests and Moonchase Charms that I marked out for you.
Linyang: Not bad, Traveler. Not bad at all.
Linyang: Still, I can't tell you about the locations of anymore chests or charms today. These are the rules, so please understand...

Linyang: Uh... Let me have a look...
Linyang: The placement of treasure chests and Moonchase Charms in Liyue should be handled by Tiantian... Oh well, let me mark some of them out for you.
Linyang: Let's just hope that she made those placements as she should've...

Traveler: So about the Moonchase Charms and treasure chests on Dragonspine...

Linyang: Oh, on Dragonspine, you say... Give me a moment...
Linyang: I remember that someone named Iris was in charge of placing items in the Dragonspine area... She really is very impressive...
Linyang: There, I've marked some of the locations out for you. Take a look at your map.
