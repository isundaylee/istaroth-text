# Where Is the Unseen Razor?


## Talk 1

Lan: I hope it turns up this time... there are so few leads left...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Lan: What brings you here? If you'd like to learn more about the Guild, please talk to Katheryne over there.
Lan: ...Oh, you're an adventurer already? Please accept my apologies, I may be the Branch Master, but I am not well acquainted with the Guild's day-to-day business.
Lan: So I don't really know any of the newcomers... Having said that, you're no newcomer at all, are you? You look like a seasoned adventurer to me.
Lan: In which case, maybe there's something you can help me with. I must emphasize though, this is not a guild quest but a personal commission.
Traveler: I'll take it!
Lan: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but it is highly unwise to accept a commission without examining the details first.
Lan: Your commission, should you choose to accept it, is to defeat two strong hilichurls who bear giant shields.
Lan: Their shields are infused with Geo energy. Not terribly dangerous, but you should still proceed carefully.
Lan: All I need you to do is defeat them. Come and find me afterwards and you will be fairly compensated.
Lan: Oh, and if you come across anything sword-related, bring it back for me.
Lan: If not, it doesn't matter. As long as you defeat the hilichurls you will receive your compensation. That's all. I will leave you to get ready now.
Traveler: Give me more details, and I'll consider it.
Lan: A cautious response. I'm sure you learned the value of caution the hard way.

## Talk 2

Lan: Have you defeated them yet?
Traveler: Not yet.
Lan: That's fine; please don't rush. An adventurer who acts in haste is sure to put themselves in harm's way.
Lan: That said... Think less haste, more speed. Because your compensation is based on how quickly you complete the assignment.

## Talk 3

Lan: Have you defeated them yet?
Traveler: Yes.
Lan: Efficient work! I'm impressed. Done like a true Adventurer.
Lan: Here is your compensation. Thanks to you, things will be much safer around here.
Lan: I don't suppose you found anything to do with a sword?
Lan: ...I see. As I expected. Never mind.
Lan: Thank you â€” here is your compensation. Enjoy the rest of your day.
