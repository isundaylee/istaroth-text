Hosseini: *cough* Once I'm done with this Energy Amplifier affair, I should... *cough*
Hosseini: Head back to the Akademiya as soon as I can... *cough*

## Talk

Traveler: Are you unwell, by any chance?
Hosseini: Oh, it was a small matter... and it's a little embarrassing, really.
Hosseini: I adjusted my research focus several times, which caused me to remain in Inazuma for a time.
Hosseini: On the return trip, I decided to look for a reliable crew to take me across the ocean.
Hosseini: After much effort, I was able to make contact with the Crux Fleet.
Hosseini: The ocean view was truly spectacular. I have taken a few walks down Sumeru's harborfront as well, but I don't actually have much experience traveling on ships themselves.
Hosseini: The vastness of the ocean was even more awe-inspiring than any book could have described. It was truly... *cough* magnificent.
Hosseini: But there was a price to pay for such wanton admiration... That is to say, I fell overboard by mistake, ahahaâ€”*cough*
Hosseini: So let's just say you're the type of person who is prone to seasickness, spending your days on the boat retching and vomiting...
Hosseini: And at the same time, you cannot swim at all, and were only discovered to have gone overboard by the sailors after some time.
Hosseini: Those were my circumstances... *cough*... I came down with a little something as a result.
Hosseini: But it is no matter. Nothing of consequence at all. It's just that I shall likely have to request sick leave when I return to Sumeru.

## Talk

Traveler: Will we meet again at the Akademiya?
Hosseini: Oh? You'd like to enroll at the Akademiya?
Hosseini: Good, good! I can see that you are a true lover of knowledge, intelligent and agile in your thoughts. You certainly have the talent for it! *cough*
Hosseini: You can even use the elements to boot, and are brimming with experience adventuring outdoors. Indeed, I'd say that you'd be a perfect fit for the Spantamad, which primarily studies the elements and the ley lines.
Hosseini: By the way, I'm a member of the Spantamad myself.
Hosseini: Given your skills, of the Six Darshans... I would deem the Haravatat my least recommended option.
Hosseini: The Haravatat spends much time with ancient runes, and its members are as eccentric in speech as they are few in number. I don't think there's much to look forward to there...
Hosseini: So when it comes to picking your own personal research path, I'd recommend the Spantamad over the Haravatat.
Hosseini: *cough* Well, that's assuming that you do manage to enroll in the Akademiya, of course.

## Talk

Traveler: Until next time.
Hosseini: Yes, see you again... *cough*
