# Talk Dialog

Traveler: And you're just looking out for your own interests.
Nacker: It's my research too! Do you have any idea how much effort I put into helping create the Arkhium Kinetic Core? Why can't I look out for my own interests, like the rest of you?
Nacker: Am I supposed to meekly submit to Choiseul's will and give up on Arkhium, just like that?
Nacker: All just to focus on mind-numbingly tedious contraptions like Mekafish, Fonta, and the like? I'd rather die!
Nacker: Talking about this now is an exercise in futility, anyway. I no longer have any ties to the Fontaine Research Institute.
Nacker: Arkhium, the Arkhium Kinetic Core, the future Fontaine Research Institute... Whatever. Let it all be.
Nacker: My research days are over.
