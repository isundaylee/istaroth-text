# The Millennial Mountains


## Talk 1

Wang: O great Millelith heroes, please see to it that The Chasm does not act up these few days!
Wang: And may we be safe and sound as we descend into the mines this time, and may those comrades of ours who no longer come to mine also fare well in their respective paths. Protect us, brave Millelith, protect us...
Wang: Hmm? What is it? Can I help you?
Traveler: You're praying to this thing?
Wang: Well, I'm praying at this Millelith memorial. I mean, it looks like a pile of unassuming rocks, but it's actually been here for five hundred years now!
Wang: The Chasm is under the protection of the Millelith, so every time we have people descend into the mines, we will pray here for the heroic souls of those who have passed to protect us.
Wang: They have long since turned into elements and become one with the mine, so when we pray for their protection, we're also showing our reverence to The Chasm itself, you know?
Wang: The ancients said that "the earth has a spirit, and the elements have souls." Those who sacrificed their lives so that we might live watch over us in similar fashion. So I believe...
Paimon: Five hundred years ago?
Wang: That's right. Back then, a dark calamity swallowed The Chasm, and Rex Lapis commanded the Millelith to stand guard over the ore veins.
Wang: That was a terrible battle. Led by a Yaksha, the Millelith came forth to stem the tide.
Wang: In the end, a group of them led the foe into the depths of The Chasm, and thus quelled the unrest.
Wang: It is said that this memorial was set up for them.
Paimon: Huh. Paimon didn't think that these ugly stones would have such history...
Wang: Hehe, don't disrespect the fallen, little one.
Traveler: Don't you worry, this little one won't bite.
Paimon: Who's a "little one"!?
Wang: Hehe, whatever the case, this is a pretty familiar story to anyone who grew up around The Chasm as we did... There are many versions of the tale, too, which sprung up over time.
Wang: If you were to talk to someone else, they might tell you a different story. Maybe this is the charm of history? Not that I'm particularly cultured, mind, but I'm just saying, y'know?
Wang: Ah, yeah, speaking of which, there's always been a rumor going about. It says that these stones hide another secret that might lead a discerning person to treasure that the Millelith left behind.
Paimon: Treasure that they left behind?
Paimon: Could you give us some details? Let's just say that... Paimon's interest has been piqued!
Wang: Eh, it's just a rumor, but it's one that's got to do with the Millelith member who created this memorial in the first place.
Traveler: Didn't the miners set this memorial up?
Wang: Nah. The one that the miners set up is elsewhere, and it isn't anywhere as large as this one.
Wang: The battle ended, but many of their comrades now rest eternally in the depths of The Chasm, together with that nameless Yaksha...
Wang: One of the soldiers fell from a great height while helping to evacuate the miners and beat back the enemy, injuring his spine and becoming unable to move on his own power as a result...
Wang: But later, it is said that he was not daunted by his circumstances, instead becoming a self-taught and much-famed doctor who would help those in the same situation as himself.
Wang: It is said that this memorial was something he set up to remember his comrades by after he had obtained a Vision.
Wang: His story would gradually fade from history, being replaced with tales of the "Millelith's treasure" and the "Yaksha's inheritance."
Wang: Those are just baseless tales. We miners generally prefer to keep our feet firmly planted, so I don't give much credence to these tales. Still...
Paimon: Still?
Wang: No, it's nothing, I just mean that I won't laugh if you do actually go looking for that treasure.
Wang: I've given it some thought, and it occurred to me that while the tales of treasure might all be false, they exist as a way for generations of people to ensure that stories are passed down and not forgotten by later generations.
Wang: Whatever the case, the one who offers up six items lost within The Chasm before this stone will be awarded the gifts of the Millelith — that's how the story goes.
Wang: And these six items are...
Wang: The Helm of Warding, which may defend one from rockfalls...
Wang: The Cup of Commons, made to memorialize comradeship...
Wang: The Skyfeather, the symbol of lofty ideals...
Wang: The Warrior's Spear, used to fend off the foe...
Wang: The "Flower of Farsight," which grew upon the cliffs of The Chasm...
Wang: And... the "Sundial of Ages," used to remember the bygone past.
Paimon: Well, that wasn't confusing at all, no sir!
Paimon: You sure this wasn't all made up by people later?
Traveler: So these items can all be found within The Chasm?
Wang: I've got no clue. Maybe they were all made up — that would certainly explain why no one's found the legendary treasure this whole time!
Wang: Ah, yes, speaking of which... There was another memorial that I mentioned, yes? *sigh* Everyone's just busied themselves with their own separate things after The Chasm was closed. No one's kept that place clean, I'll bet.
Wang: Could you help me go over there and just tidy the place up? Just a little will do...
Traveler: Sounds dubious to me...
Traveler: So this was the work of a Millelith soldier?
Wang: Indeed, both the Millelith and the miners at The Chasm set memorials up back then.
Traveler: Indeed, disrespecting the fallen is bad manners.
Paimon: Um, sorry...
Traveler: What is this thing?

## Talk 2

A Piece of Paper: "Didn't they say that some Helm of Warding thing was left here by the Millelith? We've been here all day, and there's nothing to show for it!"
A Piece of Paper: ..."Aren't these just the hats that the miners use? What Helm of Warding? You sure the intel you got was accurate?"
A Piece of Paper: (The name of the writer, "Erge," has been roughly canceled and written again twice over. It seems that this person isn't too enamored of their own penmanship...)

## Talk 3

Stone Tablet: (This small stone tablet has the following words inscribed on it...)
Stone Tablet: ..."During the battle at The Chasm, I lost the use of my four limbs and thus was forced to dictate these words for someone else to record and carve here."...
Stone Tablet: ..."I survived that fierce battle, but each night where I thought of our fallen comrades was a sleepless one. And with my body in this state, oh, how I detested the fact that I was not privileged to join them."...
Stone Tablet: ..."I attempted to join them, only to have Rex Lapis hear of it and reprimand me, waking me from my stupor."...
Stone Tablet: ..."Alas, for I can no longer make use of his gift of Millelith armor and equipment. They shall only accumulate dust if left in my keeping, and so I leave them here for someone fated to come and claim them."...
Stone Tablet: ..."Everyone, though we can no longer do so in this life, let us be comrades again in the next. Let us then share the wine of sworn brotherhood once more, and defend Liyue from its foes!"...

## Talk 4

Wang: Oh, wow, you really found it! So... this is the "treasure of the Millelith," then?
Wang: Now, I've got no clue what's in there, but I'm sure that the soldier who left that treasure behind would be pleased to know that it was found.
Wang: It's been five hundred years since that disaster... When I think about how this place was once the site of such an intense battle, one in which countless forebears of ours sacrificed themselves, I can't help but wonder...
Wang: Did any of those people who went into battle alongside the Lord of Geo think that they would be remembered by people across the centuries?
Wang: Did they ever doubt or falter in their duties? And as for those who never gained a Vision, how did they remain loyal to a god who never showed them favor, even until death?
Traveler: Their god never left their side.
Wang: ...
Wang: Yes, you're right. Those with Visions, those without... We are all working towards a future with limitless potential. I mean, that's what they call motivation, am I right?
Wang: We're the same. We're not here for the good times in the past, or for some self-realization in the present... But we do this to support one another in leaving something of ourselves behind in the times we live in.
Wang: Maybe someday in the far future, The Chasm will also become our memorial.
Wang: The pits and the valleys, the sweat of generations of miners... They all bear witness to the tough road we have chosen.
Wang: Just like this memorial, this place will be here a hundred, even a thousand years from now, as testament to the fact that the sacrifices made here were not in vain.
Wang: Hehe, well, I'm not going to live to see that happen, obviously, but if someone does come here someday to toast us poor miners long after we're gone, that would be more than enough.
Traveler: They were loyal to their own decisions as well.

## Talk 5

Wang: The items you need to find are the Helm, the Feather, the Cup, the Sundial, the Flower, and the Spear.
Wang: That said, no one's found them all to this day, so...

## Talk 6

Wang: Tell me about the "Flower of Farsight."
Wang: It is said that the Flower of Farsight will only make itself known to those with such lofty desires that they might seem crazy to some, and thus is not something ordinary people can witness. Hmm, I wonder what sort of flower that would be?

## Talk 7

Wang: Tell me about the Skyfeather.
Wang: I've heard that the Skyfeather can only be obtained from an eagle on a certain mountaintop. That said, never in all my years have I seen someone who can pluck a feather from an eagle...

## Talk 8

Wang: Tell me about the Sundial of Ages.
Wang: They say that the Sundial of Ages would be remembered by all, such that time's passage would not cause it to lose its luster. Perhaps it has never been forgotten or lost after all?

## Talk 9

Wang: The items you need to find are the Helm, the Feather, the Cup, the Sundial, the Flower, and the Spear.
Wang: That said, no one's found them all to this day, so...

## Talk 10

Wang: Tell me about the Cup of Commons.
Wang: I've heard it said that the Cup of Commons will regain its dignity someday, even if it is obtained by bandits and crooks, or becomes a lowly guest at a humble table... But what does that even mean?

## Talk 11

Wang: Tell me about the Helm of Warding.
Wang: The Helm of Warding is said to rest in the room of an ordinary person, yet may not be summoned forth by anyone but a hero... Well, this was a story I used to fall asleep to, so...

## Talk 12

Wang: Tell me about the Warrior's Spear.
Wang: The Warrior's Spear is rumored to have been set up on a lone cliff, awaiting a valiant soul equal to it. Only then will it be content to once again enter time's eternal flow... Hah, what an exaggerated legend...

## Talk 13

Memorial Stone: (Several rows of names of Millelith warriors are carved into the memorial, and the following is inscribed below...)
Memorial Stone: ..."With Liyue behind us, we fought bravely, warriors all — we feared death not, and not an inch did we yield."
Memorial Stone: ..."We accomplished the task Rex Lapis gave us, and we did not betray the people's hopes — let this stone be our witness."
Memorial Stone: ..."The years may erode all, yet the Millelith shall never be moved."

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Traveler: See you...
Wang: Yes, see you... But take care now. The Chasm is still quite a dangerous place.
