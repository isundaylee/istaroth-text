Helen: *clears throat* ...
Helen: ...Um, excuse me? I was about to begin my song... I'm trying to protect Mondstadt here. This had better be important.

Traveler: About those Sweet Flowers...
Helen: Oh, did you see the commission I put up? Finally, someone willing to help.
Helen: Have you gathered the ten Sweet Flowers?
Traveler: Here they are.
Traveler: Not yet.
Helen: Okay... Once you've gathered them all, could you pass them to me quickly? I fear that my throat's getting worse by the minute...

Traveler: Have you seen anyone around that looks a lot like me?
Helen: Oh, you're looking for someone, huh? Off the top of my head... no, nothing springs to mind.
Helen: I've duly noted your appearance, though. In the future, whenever I'm performing from somewhere high up, I'll keep an eye out for this missing person.
Helen: That's another advantage of being high up, in case you didn't know. You can see really far.

Traveler: Why the high stage?
Helen: Uh... the higher up you are, the further the sound travels. Everyone knows that... don't they?
Helen: So if I'm on a high perch, everyone in the city will be able to hear my song.
Helen: ...I actually wanted to do it on top of the statue of Barbatos, but the sisters stopped me. And they said if they caught me trying again, they'd put the Knights of Favonius onto me...

Traveler: Protecting Mondstadt?
Helen: Well of course! Ever since I started performing my songs here, everything in Mondstadt has really cleared up. Obviously that's because of my efforts, right?
Helen: Maybe I'm a bard blessed by Barbatos... Hehehe...
Helen: ...You know, I bet if Barbatos was a bard, our skills would be equally matched!

Traveler: Goodbye.
Helen: May the Wind of Mondstadt be with you... And the sound of my song, too!

Traveler: So where were you when Stormterror attacked?
Helen: Hmm? Uh... Ah yes, Stormterror. I was, uh...
Helen: That's right — I was at home, singing and playing away. And a short while afterwards, the storm stopped.
Helen: So it seems Stormterror isn't that powerful when faced with the sound of my song.
Helen: ...Now, where did I get up to? This is all your fault! I've forgotten the lyrics now...
