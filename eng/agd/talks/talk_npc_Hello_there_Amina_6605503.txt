# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Hello there, Amina.
Amina: Hehe, here to see me, are you?
Amina: Everything's going great here. No accidents reported, and the kids have... mostly stopped throwing stones into the hot springs...
Amina: Forget it. No point dwelling on sad affairs. As my grandfather said, positivity should be our guiding star!
Amina: In truth... I've been pretty busy lately, designing a new stage, reinforcing patrols, and such.
Amina: A crazy amount of ideas have been coming to mind, to be honest. I'm just hoping Manua doesn't come up with any more!
Amina: Ah, right! While I'm sure Mualani would invite you over anyway, let me just say: Don't forget to swing by often!
