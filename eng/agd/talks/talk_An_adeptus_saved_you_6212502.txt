Traveler: An adeptus saved you?
Great Merchant Huang: Some time ago, I picked up a stone that looked an outstretched thumb and little finger!
Great Merchant Huang: With such a strange shape, it must surely have been a sacred stone, and so, I must be protected by the adepti!
Great Merchant Huang: Not to mention the fact that since I obtained this mysterious stone, good things follow me wherever I go! This must be what they call "rocks fall, fortunes turn," eh?
Great Merchant Huang: When you think about it like that, I suppose all those people at the Lantern Rite were celebrating me, then! The same goes for all the people coming to Wangshu Inn. They must all be here for my blessings, no?
Great Merchant Huang: ...Well then, should you encounter any good fortune in the future, just remember to thank me in your heart.
