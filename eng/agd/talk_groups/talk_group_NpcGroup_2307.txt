Traveler: Any idea where Little Liu is?
Yundan: Little Liu? Hmm, I remember her saying that she wanted to find a high place so she could watch the meteorites...
Yundan: Hmm, I think she *climbed up those ladders over there*.

Traveler: Who are you?
Yundan: Just an ordinary old granny. I actually went to Liyue Harbor once, lived the rat race for a while... In the end I realized I'm just a normal person who needs a normal life. So I came back here.
Yundan: I help look after the little ones in the village. It helps me worry less knowing they are taught to be obedient and well-behaved.
Traveler: Tell me about your past.
Yundan: When I was little I would go fishing with my younger brother near Liyue Harbor. We managed to make a bit of money off it, and life started getting better.
Yundan: But I just couldn't get used to the constant chaos of city life, nor did the cunning one needs to try and do business come naturally to me... Maybe I just wasn't meant to get rich.
Yundan: I'm much more comfortable here. I positively relish the peace and quiet.

Traveler: Tell me about your family.
Yundan: My brother is just a normal fellow at heart, too, though he seems to be doing some sort of extraordinary job at the moment... Honestly, I think he enjoys being all secretive and deliberately mystifying about it.
Yundan: I don't really understand the rest of my relatives in the city to be honest. I wonder when they'll come and visit...
