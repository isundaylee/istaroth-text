Traveler: What's the plan you speak of?
Grundeland: Ah, that. I am presently working on the research plans for our institution. There is much to do, but thanks to the God King's radiant blessing, we have many clever minds and hands to take up the work.
Grundeland: To be entrusted with such duties in his blessed name â€” ah, such happiness is mine that shall never be surpassed.
