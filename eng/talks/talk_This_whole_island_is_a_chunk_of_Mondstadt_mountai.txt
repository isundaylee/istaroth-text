Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "This whole island is a chunk of Mondstadt mountain. A great force dislodged it from the mountain range and cast it into the sea. As it fell, it began to spin, and ultimately landed upside-down, hence the topography you see today."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Rather interesting. Another masterwork by the Anemo Archon, Barbatos, no doubt."
