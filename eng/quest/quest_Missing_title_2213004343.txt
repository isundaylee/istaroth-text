## Talk 3

Xiuhyo: Hmm... Outlander warrior, I have a favor to ask.
Xiuhyo: I am the "Master Trainer" of our tribe, but my abilities have yet to match my title, so I can't be sure about the difficulty of the "Warrior's Challenge" I've come up with...
Xiuhyo: So, could you help me test it?
Traveler: Sure.
Traveler: Give me a moment to prep...

## Talk 4

Lirio: For us, the Scions of the Canopy, agility and finesse are essential qualities, and that's why I've prepared this Warrior's Challenge.

Traveler: Let's begin!
Traveler: Give me a moment to prep...

## Talk 5

Cima: Hmm, a rare guest from afar, I see. Well, what do you say? Wanna try my Warrior's Challenge?
Cima: Many a Warrior's Challenge awaits our tribal fighters throughout Natlan. And as for me, I'm one of those who arranges those challenges.
Cima: Well, don't you look like a tough one, outlander? Wanna take on the challenge that I've prepared?
Traveler: Let's begin!
Traveler: Give me a moment to prep...

## Talk 6

Manzana: This Warrior's Challenge is designed for couriers, so it will be tough. Not that I'm underestimating you, of course.

Traveler: Let's begin!
Traveler: Give me a moment to prep...

## Talk 7

## Talk 8

Matzatli: Wanna try out this Spiritway challenge?
Matzatli: Well, you're here, so you might as well give it a whirl! Sure beats going back empty-handed, am I right?
Traveler: Let's begin!
Traveler: Give me a moment to prep...

## Talk 9

Avuia: I love the feeling of sliding along the Spiritways. There's nothing more soothing than hearing the wind whistling in your ears.

Avuia: What about you? Wanna try joining in?
Traveler: Let's begin!
Traveler: Give me a moment to prep...

## Talk 10

Quiltec: To follow the veins of the earth is most important indeed...

## Talk 11

Centaca: Collect as many Challenge Coins as you can and complete the challenge. I've naught but faith in you!

## Talk 12

Xiuhyo: Um... Collect the Challenge Coins along your path and... better yet, try to catch up to the little Tepetlisaurus.
Xiuhyo: Why? Well, little Tepetlisaurs are really cute, so I thought this would make things more interesting...

## Talk 13

Lirio: Stay quick on your feet and grab all the Challenge Coins you can... Yeah, that's kinda how the trial's gonna go.

## Talk 14

Cima: Well, simply put, just collect Challenge Coins, as many as you can get. The more, the better! The quicker, the stronger!

## Talk 15

Manzana: Use the grappling hook... or other means, to collect the explosive barrels and defeat your foes. This, too, is one of a messenger's many tasks... sorta.

## Talk 16

Tepache: You can use Jet-Set Eddies to reach high places, and it's quite the experience to boot. Be careful when you land in the water, though.

## Talk 17

Matzatli: Get on the Spiritway, then... Uh, how do I put it? Earn a higher score with some flashy-splashy motions? Something like that! There you go, super easy.

## Talk 18

Avuia: Riding Spiritways is unbelievably fun, and I'd love to share that with more folks.
