# Where Is the Unseen Razor?


## Talk 1

Lan: I have an idea that may or may not pay dividends...
Traveler: Are you still looking for that sword of yours?
Lan: Oh, it's you, Traveler. Indeed, I am still seeking the Unseen Razor.
Lan: But, even now, I have yet to find any worthwhile leads.
Lan: Searching for a sword in Liyue is like trying to find a straw from a haystack.
Lan: Someone said to me that the sword may have been destroyed long ago by a monster. But even if it were so, I would find and claim each and every last shard.
Lan: Apologies. I've been rambling. The location I need you to check this time has been marked on your map. I thank you for your aid, Traveler.
Lan: I just hope the sword isn't really broken...

## Talk 3

Lan: This sword hilt... looks still intact.
Traveler: Does it have anything to do with the Unseen Razor?
Lan: I must examine it in detail to know... Ah. I forgot to mention that I've already been scouring the lands for these weapon fragments for quite some time.
Lan: I gathered countless pieces from the marketplace, the wilds, and even bought some off adventurers. I thought that they could perhaps lead me to the Unseen Razor...
Lan: Yet, till now, I haven't found even a hint of its shadow...
Lan: Ah, no matter. We have a saying in Liyue: "Where there's a will, there's a way." I'll keep searching... Till I find the Unseen Razor, that is.
Lan: Here, Traveler. Take these as a reward for your efforts.
