Traveler: Wait, do locals drown too?
Umi: Oh, there are tons! The locals here are the rowdiest of them all.
Umi: I've seen some pass out after soaking in the pool for too long, and others with gnarly head wounds after trying to dive on the shallow end... Oh, and even Saurians dashing from one end of the pool to the other after being tricked into some liquor by the tourists.
Umi: Each of those was worse than the last...
Umi: But yeah, you know those folks who'd often say that the People of the Springs should get an Ancient Name for laziness? They should work my job for a day for a change.
