Traveler: Once more?
Arachatora: Yes! Arapacati said the "Head Mushroom" brought happiness to Nara.
Arachatora: That's why she's not angry anymore and I don't have to wait until the Sunsettias to ripen many times to pick mushrooms.
Arachatora: I must find mushrooms with better flavors. I hope this time Arapacati won't be angry, or Arapacati will definitely have me wait until the Sunsettias have ripened 100 times, or even 100 times of 100 times.
