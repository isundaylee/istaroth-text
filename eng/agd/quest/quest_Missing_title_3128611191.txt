# Missing title (3128611191)

Henry Morton: Missing text (4130584858)
Traveler: You can use a wind glider.
Henry Morton: Forget it. I've been shut indoors ever since joining the Sumeru Academia. I haven't done any outdoor activities since.
Henry Morton: You can't really use your wind glider at the Academia either, so I've probably returned all my gliding instructor's teachings back to them...
Henry Morton: If you asked me to glide over there, I'd probably fall into the water halfway.
Traveler: You could charter a boat.
Henry Morton: I thought so too, and I did remember that you could charter one at Dornman Port, but that's way too far away.
Henry Morton: Who knows how long a round trip will take, either...
Henry Morton: But I couldn't possibly construct my own boat. I mean, I learned nothing about that in the Academia...
