# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Need help?
Gravier: Uh, I'm fine... I mean, thanks for asking, but I suspect that only I can solve this problem of mine.
Gravier: I'm a Gestionnaire, and I'm new here at the Palais Mermonia. I've been assigned to perform some simple legal work here.
Gravier: That said, though, I'm a bit of an introvert. I'm not exactly used to a job like this, where I'll need to talk to lots of people.
Gravier: Monsieur Neuvillette happened by me the other day, and seeing that I looked like I wasn't doing too well, he clapped a hand on my shoulder and gave me a few comforting words... But he just... made me even more nervous.
