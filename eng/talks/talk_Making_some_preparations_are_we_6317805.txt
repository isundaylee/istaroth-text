Traveler: Making some preparations, are we?
Shima Masaoki: Of course. I'm always looking to do something for the Shogunate.
Shima Masaoki: Word on the street is that the fog over Tsurumi Island's gone, and that people might be sent there. The way I see it, the new troops need more training now than ever before!
Shima Masaoki: I mean, we can't have them panicking the moment there's a whiff on danger in the air there! That would be an embarrassment!
