## Talk

Yumemizuki Mizuki: Comfortable, yet elegant. Cozy, yet full of life... You managed to achieve a wonderful balance in this space. You must have put a lot of thought into it.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Perhaps... it's a style all your own.

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I love it! It feels... just like home.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I've spent quite a bit of time in other nations, so I'm used to many different aesthetics.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: But, that's not why this place feels so comforting...
Traveler: Oh? Then what is it about this place?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Perhaps you haven't noticed...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: But, as a well-traveled individual, your wealth of diverse experiences have subconsciously shaped your idea of "home."
Yumemizuki Mizuki: As you decorated this space, those subconscious ideas likely guided your decisions... Almost like a form of "inspiration," if you will.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Similarly, another area influenced by our subconscious... is the wondrous and mystifying realm of our dreams.
Traveler: I think... I get it?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Oho, that was fast. So, what is your interpretation?
Traveler: The Realm Within is a kind of dream?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Close! But not quite.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Simply put, to a certain extent, this place is a reflection of your hopes and desires... And, things we wish for are very likely to appear in our dreams.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: So, in that sense, this place is like a preview of your dreams — an area that is very familiar to me, of course.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: If I analyze this place, I bet I could even learn a little secret or two...
Traveler: I'm... super lost...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: It's a bit complicated. We don't need to get into the theory behind it.
Traveler: So, it's not about how this place looks...

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Of course! Any time, anywhere, any place! For however long you like...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I'm always happy to lend an ear!
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Although, there is something I wanted to ask, now that I've seen this masterpiece...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: As you get further on your journey... Will you change the look of this place?
Traveler: Change the look of this place?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Well, let's say you make your way to... Snezhnaya, and the aesthetic catches your eye. Would you try to recreate it here?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Or, say that you make a new friend. Would you decorate a portion of this Realm to make them feel at home?
Traveler: I think... I would.
Traveler: I do like to introduce new things from my journey...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I see. That makes a lot of sense...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Then, I suppose... there could be a few surprises in store one day. I'll look forward to it.
Traveler: And, I want to be considerate to every new friend I make.
Traveler: Hmm... I don't think there's really a need?
Traveler: This is a place of freedom and relaxation.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: You've got a point. There's a lesson in there somewhere... Don't get hung up on the little things. It can be much easier to relax that way...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: You have a knack for putting people at ease, and the way you designed this place reflects that... It's wonderful to be here.
Traveler: As long as everyone feels comfortable, there's no need to change things.
Traveler: By that, you mean...

## Talk

Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Well, in my free time, I like to clear my mind and listen to the lyre or the ukulele.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Even solo, the sound is almost dreamlike in its beauty, so pure and sweet...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Some emerging styles even incorporate drums or other stringed instruments to add a stronger beat and a more robust sound.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: In comparison, that kind of music is more like a gripping, vibrant dream, full of energy and passion... Listening to it can feel so intense, it can tire you out or even make you dizzy.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I'm not sure if I'm sensitive to music in general, or if I like music because, like dreams, it's full of different genres, flavors, and emotions...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Whatever the answer, I think it's important to be introspective about these things.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Anyway, I never found the time to pick up an instrument myself... Are you a musician by any chance?
Traveler: Of course! Quite a talented one at that!
Traveler: I can teach you if you want!
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I should have known... You remind me of a bard sometimes, you know. There's a certain musical cadence to the way you speak...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I'm sure taking lessons from you would be quite a therapeutic process...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: I think I'll take you up on that offer... Maestro.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Please be patient with me if I'm a slow learner.
Traveler: I'm not very good. Maybe we could learn together!
Traveler: I have a few ideas of where to start...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Sounds good! I'll leave it to you, then.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Learning something new with a friend will be an experience to remember! The sooner we learn, the sooner we can start playing our favorite songs...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: If we perform together, I bet we could produce something with a whole new kind of "flavor"... I'm looking forward to it!
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Here's to our musical journey, fellow student!

Yumemizuki Mizuki: Oh, wow... Looks like you're already an expert on Inazuman open-air hot springs.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: The temperature of the water, the shape of the stone statues, the trees and flowers around the pool, even the placement of the folding screens... Everything is just perfect.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: You might consider becoming a stakeholder in Aisa Bathhouse... If you choose to invest, we could be business partners!

## Talk

Yumemizuki Mizuki: A quiet teahouse is the perfect place to unwind... Of course, I'm referring to a quiet ambiance rather than complete silence. Gentle, soothing music played at just the right volume can do wonders for the spirit.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: You know, this is an excellent place for "guided meditation." That's a conventional treatment in my line of work...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: So, here, take a seat. Let go of your troubles, and I will help you relax.
