# Royinjan's Chapter: Linga


## Talk 1

Paimon: There's a big robot component here, too. Paimon reckons that Jazari'll take his Kamera out again if he sees it.
Paimon: Ararycan claims to have moved the big components back there. But that can't be true, right?
Ararycan: Of course it is true. Ararycan doesn't deceive Nara.
Traveler: Aha...
Paimon: Ararycan was the Aranara who played with the kids at the secret base.
Paimon: But Ararycan remembers nothing about this...
Traveler: Maybe it has something to do with the dried flower in the journal.
Paimon: Yeah. The Aranara at the Mawtiyima Forest forgot everything after giving us a flower as well.
Paimon: Maybe the three of them had the same adventures we did.
Ararycan: Ararycan doesn't know what you're talking about and Ararycan can't remember. But it's fun hanging around with little Nara!
Paimon: Paimon hopes you remain happy wherever you may go, Ararycan.
Traveler: We've encountered something like this before...
Traveler: If I'm not mistaken...

## Talk 2

Paimon: Looks like there are big robot parts here, too. Gee, imagine what would happen if Jazari saw them, eh? He'd whip his Kamera out again, and that would be the last we'd hear of him for a while.
Paimon: Ararycan claims to have moved the components back there. But that can't be true, right?
Ararycan: Of course it is true. Ararycan doesn't deceive Nara.
Traveler: Aha...
Paimon: Ararycan was the Aranara who played with the kids at the secret base.
Paimon: But Ararycan remembers nothing about this... Do Aranara forget the past too?
Traveler: "The forest remembers everything."
Ararycan: Ararycan doesn't know what you're talking about and Ararycan can't remember. But it's fun hanging around with little Nara!
Paimon: Paimon hopes you remain happy wherever you may go, Ararycan.
Traveler: If I'm not mistaken...
