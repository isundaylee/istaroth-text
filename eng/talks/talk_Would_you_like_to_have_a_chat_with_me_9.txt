Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?

Venti: Okay! Ahem... My dearest companion, is there something you wish to tell me?
Traveler: Actually, I've been pretty tired lately...
Venti: Hee-hee... My warrior, you've worked so hard.
Venti: I understand how you feel.
Venti: ...When you just can't find any more energy, and the world falls into a haze â€” even apples lose their sweet flavor.
Venti: If you can get some quality shut-eye at this time, you'll feel a lot better when you wake up.
Venti: Here, I'll lend you my shoulder.
Venti: Eh-hehe...
Venti: At any rate, don't worry.
Venti: Whenever you need me, I'll always be by your side.
Traveler: I feel a bit lost...
Venti: Hmm...
Venti: Many people may feel lost at times. After all, it's impossible for everything to happen according to your own wishes.
Venti: At a time like this, ask yourself what the most important thing is!
Venti: Even if life's all in a jumble, you can sort it out as long as there's a whisper of the wind.
Venti: ...Don't be afraid, I'm here.
Traveler: Your serious face... is a rare sight.
