Venti: Hmm... *gasp* Let's hold a feast!
Venti: Call up your good friends and I'll contribute a bottle of the finest wine from my collection!
Venti: As for the location...
Venti: Let's just have it here! We can find a clear space and decorate it with benches, a porch, and beautiful fresh flowers!
Traveler: So... what's the theme of our celebration?
Venti: Uh, we need a theme? Then hold on, lemme think of one.
Venti: Uh... "Cheers!" Eh... "Pop!" No... I got it! "Wishes for Happiness"? How's that?
Venti: Oh, yeah! Can I trouble you to prepare one of your specialty dishes?
Venti: Anything's fine â€” I like to eat any dish you make!
Traveler: Heh, sounds like it'll be quite a merry time.
Venti: Oh, yeah~ It'll definitely be lively.
Venti: Alright, then let us officially start the preparations!
Venti: What a joyous day... It calls for a drink to celebrate.
Traveler: Hmm... I feel like it'll be chaotic.
Venti: Hee-hee, making cheer from chaos is a staple of feasts!
Venti: Don't worry, I'll properly organize it.
Traveler: I'll also help out.
Traveler: Will you put on a show for us?
Venti: Sure! I'll sing along to a suite I haven't played in a long time.
Venti: Any songs you wanna hear? I can practice a bit beforehand. Of course, this won't take up much time.
