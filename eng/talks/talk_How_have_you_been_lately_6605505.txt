Traveler: How have you been lately?
Amina: Thanks for asking. With everyone's help, I'm sure it'll all start taking a turn for the better.
Amina: After the war ended, many people were gone... I just hope they all went to the same place as Auntie Atea. The more the merrier, after all!
Amina: ...Sorry, that probably sounds a bit naive. But I really believe that people from Natlan will be reunited in the Night Kingdom after they've passed.
Amina: This explains how Ancient Names are forged from the memories of heroes and passed down through the ages.
