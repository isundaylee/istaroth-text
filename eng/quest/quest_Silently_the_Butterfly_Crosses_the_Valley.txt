# Silently the Butterfly Crosses the Valley


## Talk 1

Carefree Simulacrum: Sorry? What were you saying just now...?

## Talk 2

Carefree Simulacrum: Uh... Huh? Who art thou who disturb my beauty sleep...!
Paimon: Eh!? Wh—Who's that?
Carefree Simulacrum: Agh!
Paimon: Waaaah!!!
Carefree Simulacrum: Hahahahaha! Yes, yes! To fear me is only natural! Were I unconfined to this stone, you would already be in mine belly!
Paimon: What...? Ah! So you're just a talking stone statue... Paimon thought you were a monster of some sort!
Carefree Simulacrum: Hmph! What dost thou mean, "just a talking stone statue"!? Would not one such be frightening in itself?
Paimon: Uh, we've come across many statues like you before, is the thing...
Carefree Simulacrum: Wh—What!? *sigh* Fine. Seems like there's no scaring you guys...
Paimon: Why must you do that, anyway? Sheesh! You're just a stone statue!
Carefree Simulacrum: Hmph! Even if I was "just a stone statue," this place is still the Herblord's abode! When she was yet with us, she did not appreciate others disturbing her peace at their liberty!
Carefree Simulacrum: And that's why I scare all the pesky ones away! I shall continue to do so even if she isn't around anymore!
Carefree Simulacrum: Nevertheless, your presence does feel somewhat different from that of those ordinary mortals, and considering that I couldn't scare you either...
Carefree Simulacrum: May I please ask you for a favor?
Paimon: Huh? What can we help you with?
Carefree Simulacrum: Ahem. Take a look at these colorful butterflies! Ever since the abode's lord departed, these little things have scattered all over the place, flying about as they please...
Paimon: Shh... Hang on, there's one on your head! Just a moment. We'll help you get it...

## Talk 3

Carefree Simulacrum: Hmm...? Who art thou, to disturb mine... Ah, it's you, kind humans.
Carefree Simulacrum: Butterflies... Can you not find them? Hm... Perhaps, if you look over there...
Carefree Simulacrum: So if that's all, I'm rather sleepy right now, so... *yawn* Don't mind me for a bit...
Carefree Simulacrum: Zzz... Zzz...

## Talk 4

Carefree Simulacrum: Phew... Yes, just like that!
Carefree Simulacrum: The abode's Herblord previously used these colorful butterflies to adorn its door, but said mechanism was later destroyed. These colorful butterflies and the medicine jar... were originally meant to nourish the adeptal tree.
Paimon: Adeptal tree?
Carefree Simulacrum: Heh, that's right! Back then, the Herblord planted this adeptal tree herself...
Carefree Simulacrum: It may be withered now, but the Herblord said that so long as the colorful butterflies haven't all dispersed, the tree can be revived!
Carefree Simulacrum: *sigh* She departed as soon as she lost the power to maintain her human form. I wonder how she's doing these days...
Traveler: "As the vivid butterflies converge in the jar, new life shall be restored to the withered tree..."
Carefree Simulacrum: Yep, that's right! As long as... Wait, how did you know?
Carefree Simulacrum: Never mind. Anyway, that's about it! As long as those colorful butterflies get put back into the jar, we can then nourish that withered tree! I'm counting on you, kind humans!

Carefree Simulacrum: *sigh* She departed as soon as she lost the power to maintain her human form. I wonder how she's doing these days...
Traveler: So what am I supposed to do?
Carefree Simulacrum: Ah, my apologies. I got a little carried away reminiscing about my lord...
Carefree Simulacrum: Ahem! Listen carefully, humans! As long as those colorful butterflies get put back into the jar, we can then nourish the withered tree!
Carefree Simulacrum: Heh, this is the adeptal mechanism designed by the Herblord. Pretty amazing, huh?
Traveler: Let me give it a try.
Carefree Simulacrum: Sure thing. I'm counting on you then, kind humans!
Traveler: Why colorful butterflies?
Carefree Simulacrum: Eh? Yeah, why is that... Perhaps the Herblord was just really into colorful butterflies?
Carefree Simulacrum: Uh... Anyway, I'm counting on you to get them back into the jar, kind humans!

## Talk 6

Carefree Simulacrum: Hmm...? Who art thou, to disturb mine... Ah, it's you, kind humans.
Carefree Simulacrum: Butterflies... Can you not find them? Hm... Perhaps, if you look over there...

Carefree Simulacrum: Zzz... Zzz...

## Talk 7

Paimon: Hey! You liar! We've already returned all the colorful butterflies to the jar, but the adeptal tree still looks the same to Paimon!
Carefree Simulacrum: Hmm...? Who art thou, to disturb mine... Ah, it's you, kind humans.
Carefree Simulacrum: Ooh! I never thought you'd actually be able to find all the colorful butterflies! I just said that on a whim...
Carefree Simulacrum: No, I meant... I felt the adeptal energies too! We just need to recite the formula that Herblord left us and we can revive the adeptal tree!
Carefree Simulacrum: Hold on, how did that formula go again...?
Carefree Simulacrum: "...Born in winter, thriving and withering through time. But I yearn for spring when beauty is regained..."
Carefree Simulacrum: Butterflies flutter... flutter... Uh, I don't remember what comes next, but it ends with all being revived!

## Talk 8

Paimon: Whoa, it's changed completely!
Carefree Simulacrum: Since the Herblord entrusted the tree to me, I couldn't stand to see it continue to wither! Thank you, kind humans!
Paimon: You couldn't even remember the formula at all!
Carefree Simulacrum: Eh, don't sweat the small stuff!
Carefree Simulacrum: Oh, if you're interested, I can give you a secret tip! Break off a branch and put it in the broken jar outside the abode, and the stone gate will open...

## Talk 9

Carefree Simulacrum: Hmm...? Who art thou, to disturb mine... Ah, it's you, kind humans.
Carefree Simulacrum: I leave the matter of the butterflies to you. I'm rather sleepy right now, so... *yawn* Don't mind me for a bit...
Carefree Simulacrum: Zzz... Zzz...
