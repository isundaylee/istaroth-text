## Teyvat Commemorative Album

#An album filled with memories of people and events that Traveler has encountered on his travels. On this unending journey forward, too much has happened, and too many faces have come and gone. Like a traveler who sleeps beneath the glittering stars each night, even their beauty may one day fade into numbness. To keep that day from coming, you must record every sight and soul you encounter. This is the wisdom that Paimon shared with you during your journey. It's been so many years, and Paimon has grown too. How heartwarming!
