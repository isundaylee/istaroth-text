Uncle Tian: Oh, hey kiddo!
Uncle Tian: Now here I was thinking that the Lantern Rite would go by without incident this year. But my, did I not expect to see the Jade Chamber to rise again in my time.
Uncle Tian: It's a good way to start the year, I say!

Traveler: Hello.
Uncle Tian: Hey there! Never expected any young 'uns would come talking to me at my age.
Uncle Tian: Find yourself a spot to sit. You can call me Uncle Tian. Makes this old codger feel like a young man again.
Uncle Tian: Huh? You think I still look young?
Uncle Tian: Well, youth isn't really a matter of age... it's more to do with how much pain and suffering you've experienced in your life.

Traveler: Tell me about your boat.
Uncle Tian: This boat? You like her huh? Been with me all my life...
Uncle Tian: Back when I was a young fella, I was poorer than a panhandler, but at least I had it in me to haul in whatever snagged my line!
Uncle Tian: Things you do for yourself, you yourself get to reap the rewards for. How much you sweat determines how much you get... Those were the good ole days, could just keep goin' an' never get tired.
Uncle Tian: ...
Uncle Tian: ...
Traveler: ...?
Uncle Tian: Ahhh, what was I saying... Lost my train of thought...
Uncle Tian: Oh, right. Anyway, I struggled for the first... I dunno how long, but with perseverance and bit of luck, I got my own business started up and didn't have to do all the fishin' myself anymore.
Uncle Tian: But, everyone's out tryna swindle each other, an' before I knew it, I'd lost sight of myself.
Uncle Tian: So to bring myself back to my roots, I bring my tired old self here to fish and talk about the good ole days.
Uncle Tian: Back when I was a young fella, I was poorer than a panhandler...
Traveler: You ahh... said that part already...
Uncle Tian: ...Whaddya mean I said that already? Don't butt in when the old fella's talkin'. Now back then I was poorer than a panhandler...
Uncle Tian: but at least I had it in me to haul 'em in...
Uncle Tian: ...

Traveler: So, about your real identity...
Uncle Tian: Shh... Don't shout it for the whole world to hear. Other than a few people in key posts, the number of people who know my identity can be counted on one hand.
Uncle Tian: People have ever been made to choose between status and freedom.
Uncle Tian: It has taken a lot of effort for me to preserve both, haha.
Uncle Tian: But I, too, shall give up my seat as one of the Qixing someday. The more freedom I experience, the more status feels unwieldy and clumsy.
Uncle Tian: ...I hope that "he" too can enjoy his freedom, now that he has thrown off his yoke.

Traveler: About Huixin...
Uncle Tian: Haha, thanks for looking out for my daughter.
Uncle Tian: She can be quite headstrong. Only good old Ganyu... I mean, Ms. Ganyu, can get through to her.
Uncle Tian: But ever since that previous incident, she seems to have become more receptive to my advice...
Uncle Tian: ...Speaking of which, you're quite the cunning player yourself, hmm?

Traveler: Till next time.
Uncle Tian: Go well, youngster.
Uncle Tian: If you happen to pass by Qingce Village and see my dear Yundan, be sure to speak with her, let her know I'm alive, yeah?

## Talk 2

Traveler: How have things been going lately?
Uncle Tian: Well, after handing my work off to others, I must say that I've certainly freed up a lot of time.
Uncle Tian: And now that I've had time to handle more mundane matters, I've realized that many of my old fishing buddies have either passed, or that we've drifted apart in the intervening years.
Uncle Tian: ...Seems like you've got a lot on your mind, too. So how about it, wanna reel a few fish in together?
Uncle Tian: You've got to get away from the clutter if you want to keep your mind clear. In many things, you just have to go with the flow. As long as your conscience is clear, things will be fine.

## Talk 3

Traveler: Adventure Challenge

## Talk 4

Traveler: Duel

## Talk 5

Uncle Tian: Wow. I didn't think you'd be able to break the game this way.

## Talk 6

Uncle Tian: This is a game I've been thinking about for a long time. It's not easy to break, haha.

## Talk 7

Uncle Tian: Well, if I were younger, I might have figured out a way to break it...

## Talk 8

Uncle Tian: Don't underestimate an old veteran's card skills...

## Talk 9

Traveler: What are you doing?
Uncle Tian: Just a spot of fishing. I don't make my living off of it anymore, though, so when I catch something, I throw it right back in again.
Uncle Tian: It's been a long time since I chatted with someone your age. Good to meet you. Here, have a fish.

## Talk 10

Traveler: About fishing...
Uncle Tian: Fishing, you say... Well, it's certainly not a tool to hide my identity. I really do enjoy fishing.
Uncle Tian: After a life of struggle and strife, fishing is how I quiet down and clear my thoughts.
Uncle Tian: To be honest, I'm not even all that concerned about the value of my catches anymore... On the other hand, you seem quite concerned about that, don't you?
Uncle Tian: Haha, come now, of course I can see it. Here, you can take today's catch.

## Talk 11

Uncle Tian: Darn. Seems I forgot my bait.
