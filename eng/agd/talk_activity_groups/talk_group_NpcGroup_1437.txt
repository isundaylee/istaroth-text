Swan: Hey, Honorary Knight! Wait up a moment!
Traveler: Who, me?
Swan: Haha, who but you would be Mondstadt's famous Honorary Knight?
Swan: That said, you haven't gotten a copy of the Knights of Favonius Handbook yet, have you? It contains the vast majority of the principles that Knights should follow, as well as some knowledge for common use.
Swan: As an Honorary Knight, you should at least be familiar with some of this.
Swan: I requisitioned a copy from the Knights just for you. Please give it a read.
Swan: Once you're done, I'll quiz you a little. This will involve some content recorded in the handbook, as well as some common-sense questions.
Swan: Depending on how you answer, I'll also be giving you a small gift.

## Talk

Swan: Hi. Anything the Knights can do for you?

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Swan: I'm Swan. I mostly perform sentry duty.
Swan: I also provide any necessary assistance to our business visitors in accordance with the Knights of Favonius Handbook.
Traveler: Knights of Favonius Handbook?
Swan: Yes. The Knights of Favonius Handbook is our instructional guide, and also the cornerstone of peace and prosperity in Mondstadt...
Traveler: Is there anywhere good to go in Mondstadt?
Swan: ...
Traveler: ...
Swan: ...
Swan: ...
Swan: ...Sorry, I can't find anything at all about that in the Knights of Favonius Handbook...

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Swan: Bye-bye!
Swan: May Barbatos and his gentle wind protect you!

## Talk

Swan: We are currently experiencing abnormal weather patterns. It is dangerous outside. Citizens are advised to seek shelter.

## Talk

Swan: That dragon could return at any time. The Knights of Favonius will keep watch; everyone else is urged to find shelter immediately.

## Talk

Swan: This is an emergency. Please be assured that the Knights of Favonius' first priority is to guarantee the safety of everyone in the city.

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Swan: Stormterror? One moment, let me try to recall the Knights of Favonius Handbook...
Swan: I'm sorry, I don't remember anything in there that tells us what to do when facing giant dragons.
Swan: Oh, but I do remember that it does mention how to deal with sudden threats:
Swan: "When danger is imminent, please do not panic. Cover your head with both hands, and crouch down to protect your vital parts."
Swan: I think I'll do as this says...

## Talk

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Swan: It's over at last. We can finally breathe easy.
Swan: We should suggest to the higher-ups that we need to add "what to do in the event of a giant dragon's appearance" to the Knights of Favonius Handbook.
Swan: Still, such a thing is unlikely to happen a second time...
