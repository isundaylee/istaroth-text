# As the Courtyard in Spring Once Appeared


## Talk 1

Fantastic Boat: We're almost there! Please take all yer personal belongings with ye, and mind your step as you disembark!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Look, there's something over there.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Wow, it's...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Let's take a closer look.

## Talk 3

Xinyan: I heard an old man say something about the "Kaedeharas"...
Mona: Sounds like it might be Kazuha's grandfather.

## Talk 4

Oz: I believe the other voice belongs to Lord Kazuha's father.
Fischl: Oh? I see... We have ventured into Lord Kazuha's memory.

## Talk 5

Xinyan: Looks like a letter Kazuha wrote while he was traveling.
Mona: What a sad letter...
Fischl: ...Lord Kazuha...

## Talk 6

Kaedehara Hisamichi: The flesh resides in society, while the heart yearns for the natural world... Such has been the way of the Kaedeharas for many generations.
Kaedehara Hisamichi: Kazuha, the future of this clan will one day be in your hands.
Kaedehara Hisamichi: When that time comes, remember to always stay true to yourself.

## Talk 7

Kaedehara Kageharu: Father, what are you carving?
Kaedehara Hisamichi: Haha, it's a rock garden. I'm modeling it after the scenery I saw on my travels abroad. It'll go in my bonsai later.
Kaedehara Hisamichi: Work has been so busy these years, I've barely had a moment to spend with my grandson. I hope he doesn't take after me... when he's older, he should get out there and see more of the world.

## Talk 8

Kaedehara Kazuha: An illusion? No... it felt too real to be an illusion.
Mona: Those things we saw flickering in and out, that's exactly what I saw earlier this morning!
Fischl: Does this mean... the Immernachtreich... is real?
Xinyan: Wait, what?
Fischl: Ahem!
Fischl: Hehe! Behold, the Immernachtreich has come, just as your Prinzessin had prophesied! Come, my people, a new chapter awaits us!
Oz: Indeed, mein Fräulein. We all have witnessed this miracle with our own eyes, and now is the time to celebrate the creation of a new world! Rejoice!
Fischl: Hahahaha, welcome to the Immernachtreich!
Paimon: She looks so happy, Paimon doesn't have the heart to interrupt her right now...
Mona: She doesn't seem surprised in the slightest. Does that just come with being an experienced adventurer, or...?
Kaedehara Kazuha: If this isn't an illusion, we ought to go and investigate.
Xinyan: I got an idea. If you hurt yourself in a dream, you wake up right away, don't ya?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm? Yes, you have a point.
Xinyan: Right? So c'mon, Kazuha, hit me.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Uh... I'd rather not... How about you hit me instead?
Xinyan: But that'll hurt real bad.
Paimon: Hey! There'll be no need for any of that!
Paimon: #Just leave it to us! Hey {NICKNAME}, can Paimon hit you?
Traveler: ?
Fantastic Boat: Haha, I like yer senses o' humor, me hearties. An illusion? So, talking boats and squirrels are just an illusion to humans, huh.
Squirrel: Now, now, it's understandable, old chap. Haven't you heard? As humans grow older, they forget many important things and lose many of their abilities.
Fantastic Boat: Aye, so they do... A pity, to be sure. Thinking back, in all those years I spent sailing with the fleet, I would've never imagined that one day I'd be laughing over something like this.
Fantastic Boat: Well then, me lads and lasses, don't you want to take a wee gander at all the places you're so curious about?
Paimon: Of course! But how do we get there?
Fantastic Boat: Look! Here!
Mona: At what?
Fantastic Boat: Blimey, at me, of course! Oh, that's right, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm the smartest ship you'll find in all these parts! The name's... argh, just call me whatever takes yer fancy.
Paimon: Don't you have a name?
Fantastic Boat: That I do, I just can't remember it. All I know is that I came here from Inazuma.
Paimon: In that case, Paimon shall name you... "Miitoboru"! How's that? All the other ships in Inazuma seem to have names ending in "ru," too.
Fantastic Boat: Miitoboru? Haha, that'll do nicely.
Fantastic Boat: You're lucky to have met me. I can sail through the choppiest seas with ease, there isn't a wave out there that can capsize me! So...
Fantastic Boat: Come aboard, and I'll take you wherever you'd like to go!
Squirrel: Ah, how very kind of you, old chap. Unlike that Anemo Archon who abandoned us here.
Traveler: The Anemo Archon?
Squirrel: You know, the Anemo Archon of Mondstadt.
Squirrel: Don't you know? Some of these islands used to be Mondstadt's mountaintops. Once upon a time, the Anemo Archon sliced them off to neaten the place up, and chucked them into the ocean.
Squirrel: My great-great-great-great-great-great... great grandfather was on one of the mountaintops, and got sent flying here along with it. Wretched Anemo Archon!
Paimon: How could that happen!
Squirrel: And we've been living here for generations since then, haha. Fortunately, there were a few other squirrel families that got stranded on these islands as well, so we built ourselves a kingdom here.
Squirrel: The good thing is that there are no predators or competitors around. All the pinecones on this island are ours for the taking. The bad thing is... we're stuck here.
Paimon: Didn't see that coming... Sounds like the Immernachtreich is a kingdom of squirrels!
Fischl: Hold thy tongue!
Oz: Paimon, please do not make such slanderous statements. The Immernachtreich is, of course, a kingdom of night ravens.
Fantastic Boat: Hey, lad, yes, you! You're from Inazuma, aye? That makes us brothers, haha. Every young lad of Inazuma has to pluck up the courage to set sail on an adventure one day! So, are you coming?
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...
Kaedehara Kazuha: To set sail... is to leave one's homeland and travel far away.
Fantastic Boat: Aye, you need lots of courage and just a dash of heartlessness. 'Cause once you leave, you may never return. But if you stay, you're forever a prisoner in your own heart.
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...Huh. Inspiring words, Miitoboru. And you're right. The wanderer's spirit runs in my blood. I'll go with you.
Kaedehara Kazuha: My friends, are you coming too? I want to take a look at the strange phenomena on that island.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Also, I smell ancient timber and waterproof varnish on this boat... The scent is indeed from Inazuma, so I believe he speaks the truth.
Mona: Hmm... what does everyone think?
Fischl: Oz, lay down the gangplank! Thy Prinzessin shall take to the seas!
Xinyan: Let's all go! It'll definitely be an experience.
Fantastic Boat: Haha, great! Aaand we're off!
Squirrel: Safe travels!
Traveler: What are you talking about?

## Talk 9

Kaedehara Kazuha: This bonsai... was in my family for many generations. Sadly, it ended up in a Tenryou Commission warehouse in my generation.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Haha, one thing you might not know about my past is that I spent some time as one of Inazuma's most wanted fugitives. I suspect this bonsai was confiscated during my long time on the run.
Fischl: Fugitive...
Mona: *sigh* ...Life throws all kinds of hardships at us. I doubt a single person in this world lives a truly carefree life.

## Talk 10

Kaedehara Kazuha: This bonsai... was in my family for many generations. I saw it once in a Tenryou Commission warehouse, but it looked quite different from how it does now.
Kaedehara Kazuha: At that time, there was a withered tree inside.
Mona: Why would someone keep the plant in there if it's dead?
Kaedehara Kazuha: It's a way of sending a secret message. It indicated that there was something hidden inside the flowerpot.
Kaedehara Kazuha: There was a letter buried down at the bottom, which told of an ancient secret in my clan. I did not take the bonsai with me after reading the letter, which means it should still be in the warehouse now.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I wonder who removed the plant and placed the pot here...

## Talk 11

Paimon: To hide the letter with that secret in, right?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Yes, and to give his son something to remember him by.
Kaedehara Kazuha: My grandfather returned as quickly as he could, but my great-grandfather had already passed away. They never got the chance to say goodbye to each other before the end. After that, my grandfather would spend long periods of time standing in front of this bonsai, lost in thought.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Eventually, he started to make his own bonsai. Unlike his father, he preferred arranging rock gardens instead of plants.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Perhaps influenced by my grandfather, my father also took a liking to crafting bonsai. Back then, our courtyard was filled with all kinds of them.

## Talk 12

Fantastic Boat: Good going, lads and lassies! Miitoboru admires your bravery.
Fantastic Boat: How long have you been here? Oh, it's not your first time? Haha, well I never.

## Talk 13

Kaedehara Hisamichi: Listen carefully, Kazuha. A Kaedehara blade is not forged for the purpose of harming people.

## Talk 14

Squirrel: Hey friend. Your eyes betray your thoughts — you still look very bemused.
Squirrel: Oh, come now, do you see me acting surprised at the sudden arrival of you and your party? Well then. I'm sure we can get along quite amicably.
Squirrel: If you want to know where the most scrumptious pinecones are, come find me anytime!
Squirrel: Ah... Mondstadt. I wonder what it's really like...

## Talk 15

Kaedehara Kazuha: And this flowerpot was passed down to me as a family treasure.
Kaedehara Kazuha: It's certainly no coincidence that it appeared here and became the entrance to the mirage. It's almost as if... it's giving me a chance to make up for past regrets.
Traveler: Regrets about what?
Kaedehara Kazuha: There was once a time when the Kaedeharas were an illustrious clan in Inazuma.
Kaedehara Kazuha: After the Raiden Gokaden incident, our clan's fortunes took a turn for the worse. By the time of my generation, our downfall was complete.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Later, I fled Inazuma as I didn't want be arrested. With no one left in the Kaedehara Clan, the authorities confiscated everything in our home, including this bonsai.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Like my ancestors before me, I think I'd like to try it out for myself... recreate a favorite scene from my travels and place it into this pot.
Mona: ... *sigh*
Kaedehara Kazuha: Since the contents of this bonsai affect the mirage, I'd at least like to try my hand at making something.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But what style? Should I use plants for the bonsai like my great-grandfather, or rocks like my father and grandfather...
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...Perhaps a rock garden would suit me better.
Paimon: So do you need any supplies to make this bonsai?
Kaedehara Kazuha: I think I'll need a set of tools and some rocks that can be carved and made into decorations.
Paimon: Got it, we'll help you look!
Xinyan: We might just get lucky. If the pot's here, then surely other stuff related to crafting bonsai can't be far away.
Fischl: I concur! Lord Kazuha, take heart in your search, for my retinue and I shall help you retrieve your missing treasures.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Thank you, everyone.

## Talk 16

Xinyan: So the bonsai pot belonged to your ancestors? Seems a shame to leave it empty like this.
Xinyan: Hmm, Kazuha, what do you think about maybe putting a little something inside it?
Kaedehara Kazuha: Alright.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Though I still don't understand why it has appeared here, I can give that a try.
Paimon: Eek!
