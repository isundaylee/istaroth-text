# Dream of Awakening


## Talk 1

Pedrush: Hello, Traveler. Have you ever heard of "A Moment of Dreams"?
Traveler: "A Moment of Dreams"?
Paimon: Oh, that sounds like some kind of sweet drink!
Pedrush: Haha, I'm afraid not. It's the name of an event we started to hold regularly.
Pedrush: Dreams have become quite the hot topic in Sumeru, and many people are excited to share the dreams they've seen at night.
Pedrush: The same goes for me! The last time I dreamed was when I was but a little child, so I can't help but feel excited and nostalgic about dreaming again.
Paimon: Oh right, everyone's able to dream again now!
Pedrush: Yes! We organized an event to give everyone with new dreams a platform to freely share their experiences.
Pedrush: And thus our event, "A Moment of Dreams," was born.
Paimon: So it's kinda like a fireside chat...
Pedrush: You could say that. We hear all sorts of wild and fabulous stories every day. Really, why not have a listen for yourselves?
Traveler: I can understand your curiosity...
Paimon: Yeah, but to us, dreaming is as normal as breathing.
Paimon: Wait, but if there are free drinks and snacks involved, then Paimon might consider it!
Pedrush: Oh really? So you mean... you've already seen many dreams?
Paimon: Mm-hmm, but no need to get so excited, it's really nothing special.
Pedrush: No no no, we need experienced participants like you to share your experiences with dreaming.
Pedrush: Please allow me to address you two as "dream experts"!
Traveler: ...Sounds kinda weird.
Paimon: Oh, "expert." Hehe, Paimon kinda likes it!
Pedrush: Now you seem interested, hehe. Please, follow me to the meeting place. It won't take much of your time.
Pedrush: Rest assured, you'll find all the drinks and snacks you'd like there.
Paimon: Wow, how accommodating!
Paimon: Sign us up! Ah, but wait... Paimon's getting ahead of herself again. We should see what the Traveler thinks first.
Paimon: Eh? Why aren't you saying anything?
Traveler: You're the boss...
Paimon: Hehe! Alright, hurry up and take us to be dream experts!
Pedrush: Haha, very good. Follow me, then.
Traveler: I don't think I really have a choice.
Traveler: There are some things that "expert" just doesn't seem to go with...
Traveler: What's that?

## Talk 2

Paimon: Do you know what's the most important part of being an "expert"?
Pedrush: Ahem... Well, I suppose it must be accumulating knowledge and sharing your experiences?
Paimon: Nope, it's all about the title. From now on, Paimon will be known as "Paimon, the Dream Expert"!
Pedrush: O—Okay...

## Talk 3

Paimon: The scenery here is amazing... It also seems like a great spot for eating snacks and taking a nap.
Paimon: Paimon wouldn't mind spending some time here every day, either. *sigh*
Nahida: I've yet to see anything strange about this place.
Nahida: I do not plan to deny the power of longing. Such an intense but unquantifiable emotion could indeed have the power to organize dreams.
Paimon: His wife must be a really amazing person.
Paimon: Huh? Wait, where'd he go?
Ilman: Oh, so you were waiting for me here? Well, guess what, I've brought someone amazing with me today.
Ilman: When the Dendro Archon said she wanted to come with me, I could hardly believe it!
Ilman: I'll bring Haydar once I'm more familiar with the way here. She's been telling me that she really misses you.
Paimon: Huh? Wh—What's wrong with him?
Paimon: There's nobody there.
Ilman: Wait, Maynar. Don't go that way, it's dangerous.
Nahida: Uh-oh, he's gonna fall. Catch him!
Paimon: Phew, luckily he didn't fall... But what was all that rambling about? He also looks like he's passed out...
Nahida: He's in a dream now. What he said just now matches almost perfectly with the dreams he described to us earlier.
Paimon: Oh? So... he fell asleep, and started to have the same dream?
Nahida: I find it a little strange as well, but we mustn't awaken someone while they're sleepwalking. All we can do is sit here and wait.
Ilman: Uh... Huh?
Ilman: Maynar... Where's Maynar?
Paimon: Oh, good! You're finally awake.
Ilman: What happened...
Traveler: You were sleepwalking...
Ilman: Huh? Sleepwalking?
Ilman: Oh, right... It was all just a dream...
Ilman: The moment I reached the summit, I saw my wife, Maynar, sitting there, and walked over to her.
Ilman: After I introduced her to you, she seemed a little flustered and started walking away. I told her to stop because of the cliff...
Ilman: And then she seemed to suddenly disappear. A strong wind started to blow around me and the sky grew dark.
Ilman: When I realized something wasn't right, I woke up.
Paimon: That sounds pretty wild... Maybe you were just too tired.
Ilman: I don't think so... I slept a lot yesterday, and I don't feel very sleepy now.
Nahida: Maybe we've affected the way his subconscious constructs dreams by following him here.
Nahida: Anyway, all that matters is that you woke up safe and sound.
Ilman: I think I know what happened now, I'm sorry... If it weren't for you, I would have fallen.
Nahida: Let's head back now. Don't come back to this place again for the time being.
Ilman: ...O—Okay.
Paimon: Nahida, what's on your mind? Paimon's a little worried now.
Nahida: We still don't have enough evidence to work off of, so it's hard to draw any reliable conclusions yet... But I'm concerned that Ilman's case may not be unique to him...
Paimon: Oh right, come to think of it, there were lots of people from the event who had vivid memories of their dreams!
Traveler: Maybe this phenomenon is already spreading.
Nahida: Right, and not only at "A Moment of Dreams." There may be people like this all across Sumeru.
Nahida: We need to understand what's happening and the rate of its development as soon as possible.
Paimon: Then there's no time to lose. Let's head back!
Paimon: Stop standing there, Ilman! Let's go!
Traveler: And almost fell.

## Talk 4

Pedrush: I didn't expect the Dendro Archon to attend this event in person... It's like a dream.

## Talk 5

Pedrush: Oh, you're back already. How did it go?
Nahida: We have an emergency on our hands. Please notify everyone here that while they can continue to discuss their dreams, they mustn't try to visit or recreate the locations and scenes that they have been experiencing in them.
Pedrush: What? A—Alright, if that's the wish of the great Dendro Archon...
Pedrush: But could you at least tell me what happened? You all look so serious...
Black Screen Text: You tell Pedrush what happened on your trip with Ilman.
Pedrush: I see, I never knew even a dream could be so dangerous.
Pedrush: Don't worry. I'll be sure to notify all the event participants, and inform the other staff members about what has happened.
Pedrush: Using the event registration list, I should be able to contact more people that were interested in dreams, and warn them about the situation.
Nahida: Thank you, that would be very helpful.
Pedrush: Let me confirm if all of today's participants are still here...
Pedrush: Ata has already left... It seemed that he was on his way to make a hammer, so that shouldn't be a problem. Oh? Wait a second... Where's Kathya?
Pedrush: Has anyone seen Kathya? Has she already left?
Debbi: Oh, I think she already left. She said there was somewhere she wanted to go...
Paimon: Oh no, did she want to look for the place from her dreams, too?
Nahida: Can you tell us where she went?
Debbi: Yes, she did briefly mention it... somewhere near Chatrakam Cave.
Nahida: Alright, thank you. We'll go look for her.
Nahida: Please help us tell the others not to do anything reckless.
Debbi: Sure thing. *sigh* Who would have known things would've turned out like this...

## Talk 6

Nasser: What a lucky day... Just wait till my friends hear about this!

## Talk 7

Pawlin: I wish my dreams could be a little more practical, you know... Maybe something like becoming rich and famous overnight.

## Talk 8

Debbi: It's just sleepwalking, they're really overreacting.
Debbi: *yawn* I'm getting really sleepy.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Ugh, their questions were way too difficult. We don't actually know anything more than they do. We're just more experienced dreamers, that's all.
Traveler: They didn't really care about the answers.
Paimon: You do have a point. It's more rewarding to explore and contemplate the meaning of a question than to focus on the answer itself.
Paimon: Right now, these people are like wanderers who've starved for three days and three nights and are desperate to replenish their energy. Any explanation they get now is like pure sustenance to them, no matter how good the explanation really is!
Paimon: Oh, and now that Paimon has said that, you know who comes to mind?
Traveler: Nahida.
Paimon: Bingo! If she was here, she'd probably be making some similar analogy.
Paimon: Unfortunately, she's super busy right now, and may not have time for gatherings like this.
Pedrush: Dear experts, we have another guest who would like to consult you.
Paimon: Eh? But you saw how we answered all the questions just now... We're not really all that knowledgeable.
Pedrush: Ah, but this guest is rather... special.
Nahida: My question is, why didn't you immediately tell me about such an interesting place?
Paimon: Huh, Nahida!? How did you get here!?
Nahida: Interesting events like "A Moment of Dreams" don't happen every day, after all. No matter how busy things are, I'd still set aside some time to check it out.
Nahida: Anyway, I really didn't expect to meet you here.
Paimon: Oh, right! If there's anyone that understands dreams, it's you! You should be able to help us answer all these questions!
Nahida: You're not wrong. All right, they can ask me anything. The more interesting, the better.
Ilman: ...
Nahida: Huh? What's wrong? You were all so excited a minute ago... why the sudden hesitation?
Traveler: I think they need to build up some courage first.
Nahida: Even so, it's not like I look super intimidating or anything, right?
Nahida: And in terms of reputation and renown, you've also done many great things in Sumeru, yet they didn't even flinch at you.
Traveler: Still, not quite the same as approaching an archon.
Nahida: Alas, the interesting questions have all vanished in an instant. It appears I'm the one spoiling the fun here. I'll see myself out.
Paimon: Aw, that's not true, Nahida!
Nahida: I don't want to get in the way of the original purpose of "A Moment of Dreams," which is to let people gather here and freely share their marvelous dreams.
Nahida: Now the atmosphere here is like water poured into a container... The water is more secure and settled, but it has lost its free-flowing nature from the river.
Nahida: I just wanted to be another drop in the water, not the cold and restrictive container.
Traveler: Is she doing what I think she is...?
Paimon: She's sulking...
Paimon: Um, hey, it's all right, everyone. No need to be shy! The Dendro Archon is really nice, so please, just go ahead and ask! Otherwise, she'll leave.
Ata: A—Alright... I'll give it a try.
Paimon: Oh, it's the slime guy.
Ata: Hey, drop the nicknames, would ya? Besides... I don't want to become a Slime anymore. Maybe a Finch or fish is more suitable for me.
Nahida: I see. So you want to become a small animal in your dreams, right? Why do you think that sounds good to you?
Ata: I guess I just want to experience something different. My everyday life is nothing but the same...
Ata: The sky is right above me, and the ocean just over the horizon, yet I remain caged in a life of monotony.
Nahida: So you want to experience something new in your dreams... Sorry, I'm getting a little confused. Why don't you seek out some new experiences in real life?
Ata: Because if I don't work, I won't have any Mora. Sure, I don't want to be out hammering nails and cutting wood every day, but I have aging parents and young children to take care of.
Ata: By the time this all dawned on me, I realized that my life has already been filled to the brim by trifling matters, and I have no more freedom.
Nahida: But if that's the case, then even if you became a flying bird or swimming fish, you will still be hammering nails and cutting wood in your dreams.
Nahida: The reason is you've already been caged. It doesn't matter what your physical body turns into, your mind will still be stuck in the same predicament.
Ata: Really? That sounds pretty terrible! Then what should I do?
Nahida: I don't know everything that you're going through, but how about replacing your hammer?
Ata: Huh? Replacing my hammer?
Nahida: That's right. Having worked for such a long time, you of all people must know what makes a good hammer.
Ata: Well, of course. A good hammer needs to be heavy enough to drive the nail in with just a couple taps... and the handle has to have a good grip to it — not too smooth.
Ata: Come to think of it, I haven't replaced my current hammer in quite some time.
Nahida: You should replace it. Then decorate the handle with something you like... maybe some ornaments, fur, or a hard leather wrapping. Then, write the names of your children on it.
Ata: That makes sense... I think it'd give me a good boost of energy at work!
Nahida: A new sense of adventure often begins with the little things in life.
Nahida: You don't need to become a bird in the air or fish in the sea. You only need to do your best in life, and all those things you cherish will become your source of happiness.
Ata: Yes, yes... I get it now. This is a real eye-opener for me!
Ata: I'll go and pick out a new hammer right away... No, I should make one of my own. Thank you, great Dendro Archon!
Paimon: That's our Nahida! Only you would know how to get right to the heart of the problem.
Nahida: Actually, I didn't really understand the problem.
Paimon: Huh?
Nahida: I gave him that advice because I once saw a worker doing the same thing. Whenever he became tired, he would look at some names on the handle of his tool.
Nahida: After a moment, he'd start to smile. It really surprised me at the time... My guess is that the names on the handle were of important people to him.
Traveler: I think I understand.
Nahida: Mm-hmm. After observation, I know this kind of behavior motivates people... but why is that?
Nahida: Is it because of excitement, anticipation, or helplessness? I really don't know... And even if I could know what's going through his mind, it's still difficult to fully grasp his feelings.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets what you mean... Huh, Paimon had no idea it takes you so much effort to understand these kinds of things...
Nahida: Hehe, that's why I was a bit nervous just now. But luckily, seeing his happy face in the end reassured me that I didn't say anything wrong.
Nahida: Don't mind me, though. This is just my way of learning.
Traveler: I'm happy to help if you ever need it.
Paimon: Hey, don't forget about Paimon! Everyone knows that Paimon's also super skilled at reading people's feelings!
Nahida: Thanks, you two. That makes me feel a lot better. Let's move on to the next question, shall we?
Ilman: I already asked the experts my question earlier, but I wanted to hear the Dendro Archon's response, too.
Ilman: What should I do if I want to see my deceased wife in my dreams every night?
Nahida: Hmm, longing for the deceased...
Traveler: (Is she remembering something about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata?)
Nahida: Even if you keep reliving those beautiful memories, it'll only highlight the emptiness in your real life.
Nahida: If your wife were still alive, she certainly wouldn't want to see you like this, would she?
Ilman: No, I suppose not... But our time together in my dreams is not just reliving our past together.
Ilman: I don't know. Maybe it's because I miss her too much, but it's really as if she had come back to life in my dreams.
Ilman: She even remembers each and every dream. After I wake up and then continue dreaming again later, we can pick up our conversation right where we last left off.
Nahida: That's really amazing. Statistically speaking, continuous dreams are extremely rare.
Ilman: It's almost as if my wife has obtained a second life in my dreams. But the more vivid she appears, the emptier I feel and the more painful it is when I wake up. I don't know whether to call it a blessing or a curse...
Nahida: Maybe all of this is rooted in your deep longing for her.
Nahida: Were there any unresolved matters or regrets between the two of you?
Ilman: I don't know... I suppose my biggest regret is that I couldn't spend the rest of my life with her.
Ilman: I really felt like I was ready to move on. I wouldn't be so hesitant now if it weren't for these hyper-realistic dreams I've been having.
Paimon: Huh. You know, they say that whatever's on your mind is what goes into your dreams.
Nahida: But dreams are, and will forever be, just dreams. We are people living in the real world.
Nahida: It's not good to be overly obsessed with dreams. All it'll do is fill up your mind and eat away at your thoughts.
Ilman: Yes, I know... That's why I'm also a little disappointed in myself. I still need to take care of our child.
Ilman: And it's probably not good to let her see me in such a state...
Ilman: *sigh* Anyway, thanks for your advice, great Dendro Archon.
Nahida: Hmm, I'm a little worried about him. I hope he can find a way to cheer up soon.
Nahida: I think I can handle things from here. You don't need to stay here if you find it boring. You're here to have a good time, after all.
Traveler: (No, she shouldn't be able to remember anymore.)
Traveler: You were just drawing from a similar example.
Traveler: Vivid dreams are just really exciting to them.

## Talk 10

Paimon: Are you feeling any better now?
Ilman: Yes. I think the Dendro Archon made a really good point. I need to stop dwelling on my wife like this and move on with my life.
Ilman: Now that I think about it, my wife and I always meet at a familiar place in my dreams.
Ilman: I know where that place exists in reality, but it's a bit far and dangerous. I don't dare to go there on my own.
Ilman: But, at the same time, I feel as if I should go and have a look anyway. Perhaps I'll be able to move on once I see that there's nothing there.
Traveler: Sounds like a good plan.
Ilman: Otherwise, I'll keep on feeling like everything is covered in a haze... like I'm only half-awake.
Ilman: Once I can stop dreaming about that place, I'll probably be able to get my life back together.
Ilman: Actually, you two are adventurers, right? If it's okay with you, could you escort me to that place?
Traveler: Sure, let's go have a look.
Paimon: Yeah, it might also be a good chance for us to unwind.
Paimon: Even if you can't see your wife there, taking in some nice scenery will definitely help cheer you up.
Ilman: Yeah, I hope so too.
Paimon: Alright, go ahead and get yourself ready then.
Traveler: (Speaking of longing for the deceased, I'd better tell Nahida about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.)
Traveler: (Nahida should at least know that she once existed in this world.)
Nahida: Ahem! Are you headed off to some interesting place without telling me again?
Paimon: Huh, wait, aren't you supposed to be answering questions?
Nahida: I just finished. And I really got a lot out of it... so many interesting and novel thoughts.
Nahida: Anyway, it looks like you're going somewhere. Why don't you take me with you?
Ilman: Oh, there's no need to trouble you, great Dendro Archon. I imagine you must have many other important things to deal with.
Nahida: No need to stand on ceremony. Besides, I wouldn't have asked to come along if I didn't have a good reason.
Nahida: I wanted to use this opportunity to discuss with you some things that are puzzling me right now.
Ilman: Hmm, I didn't know the great Dendro Archon could become puzzled, too...
Nahida: I'm not all that different from you, you know. All right, let's go. We can talk on the way.
Traveler: (I'd better go with her. The whole Greater Lord Rukkhadevata thing will take some explaining...)
Traveler: Let's go get a breath of fresh air.

## Talk 11

Debbi: After talking so much about dreams, I'm feeling a little bit sleepy.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Nasser: It's just a dream. How bad could it be?

### Additional Talk 2

Pawlin: What's all the sudden commotion about?

### Additional Talk 3

Paimon: Ah, it's always nice to go for a leisurely stroll!
Ilman: Do adventurers often go to places like this?
Traveler: Yes, of course.
Ilman: Hmm, I guess so.
Nahida: So this is where you always meet your wife in your dreams?
Ilman: Yes, for the most part. Our place is on the summit just up ahead.
Ilman: When I saw her in my dreams, we didn't do anything but talk about ordinary, mundane topics.
Ilman: I'd tell her about our daughter, Haydar, and she always listened intently.
Ilman: She would also reminisce about the past with me, telling me interesting stories and cracking jokes.
Ilman: It feels like no matter how long we may chat, it's never enough.
Paimon: Sometimes, it's the little things in life that matter the most.
Nahida: This is the part I'm a little puzzled about...
Nahida: I am very familiar with dreams, and normally, they lack logic and continuity.
Nahida: But you said she could remember what you had told her before, right?
Ilman: That's right. She always listened to me carefully in real life, and now, she's doing the same in my dreams.
Ilman: She always surprises me with some details from our lives in the real world. The fact that she can remember such things makes me feel like she's alive.
Paimon: Whoa, that's pretty weird... Well, dreams are kinda weird to begin with.
Nahida: However, the problem is that his dreams have too much structure and continuity. Most dreams are far more fragile than you could imagine.
Nahida: For example, a loud noise outside your window in the real world could cause your dream self to get loaded into and fired out of a big cannon.
Nahida: Another example... If you're thirsty in the real world, then you might find yourself trudging through a desert in your dream.
Nahida: But the appearance of your wife seems unusually stable and unaffected by any outside interference. Statistically, this should be extremely rare.
Ilman: I don't understand it either, but I have no reason to suspect or reject these dreams. They're too beautiful.
Traveler: Indeed.
Nahida: But I still want to figure out the how and the why. These kinds of dreams are novel to me as well. That's why I want to have a look at the scene your dreams have been taking place at.
Nahida: Let's go! Just think of it as a nice little hike to the top of the mountain.
Traveler: I agree, it doesn't really feel like a cause for concern.
Traveler: We usually journey through far more dangerous places than this.

### Additional Talk 4

Nahida: ...Another recurring dream?
Debbi: Yeah, I'm starting to wonder if it's some kind of hint.

### Additional Talk 5

Paimon: Well, he really wasn't kidding. This place definitely isn't safe.
Nahida: No matter. We'll just finish them quickly.
Paimon: Huh? Are you going to fight too, Nahida?
Nahida: Of course. This is all part of our little trip.
