### Additional Talk 1

Quinn: Thanks for getting rid of them, Traveler.
Quinn: Thank goodness you came. *sigh* But I'm stuck here while this roadblock continues.
Quinn: If this keeps up much longer, all this fruit is going to go bad... after I spent so long gathering it, too.
Quinn: Can you get rid of the roadblock for me?
Traveler: Sure.
Quinn: Wonderful. I can't thank you enough!
Traveler: Sorry, I'm busy.
Quinn: Oh... Really? I figured if you help someone out, you see it through all the way... Anyway, you're the only hope I've got.

### Additional Talk 2

Quinn: Thank you so much, Traveler.
Quinn: My plan was to pick some fruit here then sell it back in the city.
Quinn: I hadn't counted on being held up by a roadblock... and then set upon by that group.
Quinn: Okay, I'm going back to Mondstadt. Do stop by the shop if you're ever in town!
Quinn: Take these as a token of my gratitude. See how fresh they are? That's why Beatrice is always trying to buy them from me.
