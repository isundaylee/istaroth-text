Tia: *sigh* Why won't the grownups let us go up to roof?
Tia: There was a little girl just now who wanted to go up to the roof to see the fireworks, but that green-haired guy next to her wouldn't allow it...
Tia: I heard that they had something else they needed to do... Well, I'm free right now, but Daddy still won't let me up on the roof! What's with that?

## Talk

Tia: Are dreams black, or white? Are they another world? I can never remember what happened in my dreams when I wake up.
Tia: But everyone's saying that if you touch those strange stones, you'll sleep for a long, long time. If I dream for that long, I'll definitely remember my dream, right?

Traveler: Has traveling been fun?
Tia: Yup! This is my first time outside Mondstadt. Everything here is so cool!
Tia: When I was small, I could only read "Vera's Melancholy." I would imagine I was Vera, experiencing all kinds of amazing adventures!
Tia: I know! I'll give you this copy of "Vera's Melancholy." I might have flipped through it a bit too much...
Tia: But I don't need it anymore, because I'm on a real adventure with Daddy. My experiences will be even more interesting than the novel!
