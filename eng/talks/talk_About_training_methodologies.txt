Traveler: About training methodologies...
Hanqian: You don't look like some Millelith elite. An adventurer, then?
Hanqian: If you ask me, we, the Millelith troops, and adventurers face different challenges, so our training programs emphasize different things.
Hanqian: For a guard, everything is about stamina. Endurance and weight training are extremely important.
Hanqian: You can ask Gaming about it if you'd like.
Hanqian: He's not the most muscular one, but his stamina, strength, and explosive power are second to none.
Hanqian: Maybe it's because he often practices Wushou Dance, which requires precise movements and core strength to get through any given show.
Hanqian: But I can't train like him, so I improve my stamina in the most basic way possible.
