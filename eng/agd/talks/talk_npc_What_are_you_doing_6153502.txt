Traveler: What are you doing?
Ernest: I'm the cellar manager here. Occasionally I oversee stock transportation.
Ernest: The role isn't stressful, and the boss is extravagant â€” he pays me quite well.
Ernest: Even without all that, just being in the company of this priceless stash is amazing.
Ernest: Just think of how few people ever get a chance to even see such magnificence, let alone work with it.
