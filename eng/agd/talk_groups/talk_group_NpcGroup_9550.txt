Baizhu: This crowded tavern is getting terribly stuffy... They should really open a window to let some fresh air in.

Traveler: Let's play Genius Invokation TCG.

Traveler: I've got other things to do right now...
Baizhu: Goodbye. I'll be leaving myself shortly... I left some herbs out to dry — I do hope Gui remembered to take them in...

## Talk

Baizhu: It's just a game, so don't take it to heart. Take it from me — I'm a doctor. Excessive rumination on negative thoughts is known to cause many adverse health effects.

## Talk

Baizhu: Card games do not appear to be my forte... Perhaps in the future, I should stick to medicine.

## Talk

Baizhu: As you wish. I am hardly an expert at this game, however, so please forgive me if my perfomance fails to live up to your expectations.

Traveler: Let me adjust my deck first...

Baizhu: That partly came down to luck... But I daresay I won't be needing your forgiveness today.

## Talk

Baizhu: *cough* ...I am defeated. That went much as I expected...

## Talk

Baizhu: Happy to oblige, but remember — everything in moderation, even card games. You might think of them as a fun way to relax, but they actually require substantial mental energy, so be sure to get adequate rest.

Baizhu: Ah... Well, that was a stroke of good fortune... Though I couldn't help but notice you were visibly anxious during the game, which seemed to be affecting your concentration. It could simply be sleep deprivation, but are you experiencing any other symptoms?

## Talk

Baizhu: You beat me. *sigh*... I must say, I'm feeling a little faint after all that. A cup of strong tea should rejuvenate me, shall I make one for you, too?
