Traveler: About Cider Lake...
Paimon: Cider Lake never freezes, no matter what time of the year it is.
Paimon: The best apple ciders in Mondstadt can only be made using the fresh water from this lake.
Paimon: It really does taste great! Paimon could drink two big bottles in a second!
Traveler: Wow.
Paimon: Tee-hee!
Traveler: With your size...
Traveler: I can't believe that you can drink that much water...
Paimon: Paimon always has room for tasty drinks.
Traveler: Huh...
Traveler: I guess the world really is a big place.
Traveler: So many things to consider...
Traveler: ...And not explode like an Anemo Slime.
