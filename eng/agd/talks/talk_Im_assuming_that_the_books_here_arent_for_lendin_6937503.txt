Navia: I'm assuming that the books here aren't for lending out...?
Navia: In that case, I guess I'll have to read as much as I can while I'm here and take detailed notes on the best stories. I'm sure the children of Poisson would love to hear them.
Navia: Also... I noticed that some of the "fairy tales" here really aren't suitable for children at all... Makes me curious what sort of quirky person could've written them, haha.
