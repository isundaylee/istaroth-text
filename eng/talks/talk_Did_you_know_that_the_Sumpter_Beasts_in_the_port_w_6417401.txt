Nika: Did you know that the Sumpter Beasts in the port were all raised by my dad?
Zai: Wow, your dad is amazing!
Nika: Of course! What about your dad? Does he do anything amazing?
Zai: My dad... I don't think he's good at anything. He just hangs around at home all day, playing cards and having sunbaths.
Nika: Does that mean your family doesn't even have one Sumpter Beast...?
Zai: Yeah, we don't. There are people with Sumpter Beasts who often come looking for my dad, but they would soon take the Sumpter Beasts away and leave nothing for us...
Nika: Eh? Why...
Zai: So I've always been curious. Sumpter Beasts look like huge loaves of bread... Do they taste as good as buttered bread, too?
Zai: My family has lots of big ships at sea, so we eat fish every day. All kinds of fish. And I'm getting sick of it!
Nika: Poor you... I haven't eaten Sumpter Beasts either, but I can ask my father if he can spare one for you.
Zai: Really? You're the best!
