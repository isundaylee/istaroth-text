Traveler: "Resurrecting King Deshret"?
Feroz: Foolish idea!
Feroz: Toying with life and death is a futile endeavor!
Feroz: If King Deshret could rise from the sands, so could Greater Lord Rukkhadevata sprout from the soil!
Feroz: King Deshret is long gone. Those wannabes don't deserve the title of the Eremites if they can't even face it!
Feroz: Death is the fairest thing in the world. A god high above or a bug deep in dirt, it comes for everyone all the same.
