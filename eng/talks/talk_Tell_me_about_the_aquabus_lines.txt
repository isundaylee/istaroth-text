Traveler: Tell me about the aquabus lines...
Grosley: There are three aquabus lines here in Fontaine — the Callas Line, the Clementine Line, and the Navia Line.
Grosley: These three names were not chosen at random, far from it. They refer to Callas, the President of the Spina di Rosula, his wife, and his daughter respectively.
Grosley: The aquabus had a truly troubled gestation — if not for the Spina, we'd still be navigating on foot.
