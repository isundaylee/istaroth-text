Xinyan: You sure don't look like you're rarin' to go anywhere. Wanna listen to my new song?
Xinyan: Hmm... Although, this doesn't really seem like the right place for a rock 'n' roll concert...
Xinyan: Let's talk about some of your adventuring highlights instead! They're pretty rock 'n' roll too!

## Talk 1

Xinyan: Whenever I'm on stage, I always wanna push my music a little bit further, and make that one guitar riff even gnarlier!
Xinyan: A live gig is a different kind of beast than the ones we're facing here, that's for sure... But I ain't one to back down from a challenge.
Xinyan: When the crowd's waitin', you gotta get out there and face the music. Same applies here. So come on â€” time to do some shredding!

## Talk 2

Xinyan: If someone wrote me into a story, I don't think I'd be the little kiddos' favorite character.
Xinyan: People tend to judge others based on first impressions. And kids are too young to know any different, they just say whatever they're thinking... I'm well aware of that.
Xinyan: But that doesn't matter! Just you wait and see, I'll win 'em over with my music sooner or later!
