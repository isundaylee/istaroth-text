Traveler: About books from the past...
Nakanishi: Youngster, are you also interested in old tomes as well? Not bad. Kids like you are rare.
Nakanishi: You have to read the these old classics slowly. Nowadays...
Nakanishi: Ah, I'm sorry. It's not that I disapprove of the younger generation. It's just the fact that Yae Publishing House has been focusing on Light Literature recently... I really can't accept that.
Nakanishi: Pondering, thinking, and coming up with the right words are all part of the fun of literature.
Nakanishi: Using simple and forgettable pleasures to win readers over... I don't think it's a good trend...
