# Talk Dialog

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): The Transfiguration Studio will be constructed soon! Walk-in consultations welcome. Transfiguration, get a new face and a new life!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Transfiguration? Is that really possible?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Of course it's possible! We've already completed the preliminary theoretical verification. It's just that such a dramatic and groundbreaking undertaking requires a bit more Mora to continue to achieve new breakthroughs."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Really? How much Mora? Just give me a number, I'll pay it!"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Come on, Colin, give it up. Such an obvious scam and you can't even tell?"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Lelienne, don't forget the rules here. Or do you want to be unable to stay even in the Fleuve Cendre?"
