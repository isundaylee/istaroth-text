Traveler: <color=#FFCC33FF>How do you like it here?</color>
Diona: Hmph, adequate.
Traveler: Just adequate?
Diona: Well, the grass here isn't as soft as the spot where I usually take my afternoon nap.
Diona: There aren't as many butterflies here as in the meadow I like to go to.
Diona: And I can't hunt freely here like out in the wilderness.
Traveler: I'll... look into making some improvements.
Diona: But... there's no smell of alcohol hanging in the air here...
Diona: ...And no drunkards kicking up a fuss.
Diona: So... I think we can keep it the way it is...
Traveler: Any suggestions?
