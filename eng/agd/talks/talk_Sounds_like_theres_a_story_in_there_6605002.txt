Traveler: Sounds like there's a story in there.
Ossie: What's there to tell? Whether your memory's good or bad, life's still life.
Ossie: Has having a bad memory ever caused problems for me? Not really, aside from forgetting lyrics while I was singing.
Ossie: But that's all ancient history now! You wouldn't believe it, but one time, I completely blanked out while I was performing between matches during the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame. That was quite the thrill...
Ossie: It's just lucky that the Masters of the Night-Wind have a habit of writing rather "classical" sounding lyrics. No one even knows what they mean half the time, so your audience won't notice when you go off piste, hehe.
