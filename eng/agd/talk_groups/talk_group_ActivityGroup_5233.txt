Phonia: Let the wind lead, Honorary Knight. As you can see, the Knights are currently piloting Wargaming simulations. If you can spare the time, we hope you can assist us in completing the testing.
Traveler: And you are...
Phonia: I'm Phonia, intelligence officer of the reorganized 7th Company, and also one of the people who proposed this Wargame.
Phonia: Currently, my main tasks are the development and maintenance of alchemical recon equipment, collecting intel, and analyzing enemies. If you need help, just contact my acting superior.
Traveler: Sounds like reporting work...
Phonia: Well, we all work for the Knights of Favonius, and we're all on the clock right now, so rather than indulging ourselves in exchanges of meaningless information, our time would be best used discussing useful intel...
Phonia: I am but an ordinary cog in the machine that is the Knights of Favonius. Aside from my duties, any information about me is of no significance to you.
Traveler: Well, "cog" is a rather peculiar way to describe yourself.
Phonia: It is only the truth. I'm just an ordinary person without any particular talent or ambition. I'm just here to do what I can.
Phonia: And that's fine by me. I worry about nothing outside of my duties, and I live an ordinary life. A good way to avoid troubles, really.
Traveler: Err, could you tell me a bit about yourself anyway?
Phonia: I've told you all that's worth hearing. Or would you like to hear something more personal? Let me think...
Phonia: I'm Phonia, 26 years old, single. I currently live in the third room on the third floor of the third building to the right of the city gates. I have a roommate called Ematol, who also happens to be my tenant, and the monthly rent is... I forget, it's not important.
Phonia: My hobby is sleeping. After work, I just go home and sleep. If it's too noisy, I'll have some wine to help me sleep. I don't remember what kind of wine I used to drink, but that's not important either. As long as it can get me drunk, it's good wine.
Phonia: As for where I was born, how I spent my childhood, what my parents did before I was born, and all that, I suspect such things are far less significant.
Phonia: If you don't need any more information from me, please allow me to continue my analysis work. Of course, if you do have any questions about the Wargame, please feel free to consult me at any time.
Traveler: Your acting superior?
Phonia: Yes. 7th Company was only reorganized recently, so we haven't yet settled on our captaincy.
Phonia: The 7th Company is temporarily designated as a "Combined Arms Company," which integrates knights with a range of capabilities into a single combat unit, with a balance of ranged and melee firepower. Such a unit is also very reliant on reconnaissance.
Phonia: In time, the expeditionary force's No. 2 — the venerable Commander Frederica Gunnhildr — might become our Company's Captain.
Phonia: After all, Commander Frederica has served for longer than many Knights have been alive, and her experience in battle is unmatched. It wouldn't be too much to say she is perfectly suited for leadership.
Traveler: Wait. That Gunnhildr?
Phonia: Correct! Commander Frederica is the Acting Grand Master's mother, and is renowned throughout Mondstadt.
Phonia: She's been on active duty on the front lines for decades now, never tiring or slowing. When the youths of Mondstadt talk of their dreams of being a hero, the name "Frederica" is never far from their lips.
Phonia: And I was one of them! When I joined the Knights of Favonius, it was because of my admiration for Commander Frederica...
Phonia: Of course, I later realized that I was only talented enough to be just one more cog in the machine. As for the heroic protagonists of the storybooks that can take on a hundred foes all alone... that's another story.
Traveler: So Jean's mother... will be your captain?
Phonia: That's only my speculation as an intelligence officer. As I see it, the 7th Company will likely be one of the most formidable units, and so Commander Frederica would be the most suitable candidate for Captain.
Phonia: Though Commander Frederica's position in the Knights of Favonius has long surpassed any ordinary Captain, she's never been one for pushing pencils. She's always insisted on staying on the front lines, toe-to-toe with foes.
Phonia: In principle, the Knights of Favonius value ability and experience equally, so after she returns, perhaps we'll see the Acting Grand Master giving orders to Commander Frederica...
Traveler: Isn't that also Jean's last name...?
Traveler: Wargame?
Phonia: Yes. As I'm sure you've seen, the scourge of monsters wandering the wilds remains one of the issues that all nations in Teyvat must deal with.
Phonia: In short, I've drawn inspiration from the Millelith General Staff's previous methods, collating all manner of reports in order to construct this Wargame.
Phonia: By simulating battles between monsters, we can learn the best strategies to defeat them while in a non-combat environment. If you're interested, please give it a try yourself.
Traveler: It looks like... a game of chess?
Phonia: You're certainly right about that. There are indeed similarities between the conduct of Wargames and chess, so the comparison is quite apt.
Phonia: "Playing chess" is enough to help conduct valuable tactical analysis, and that's also where the charm of Wargames lie. You can just think of it as a regular "chess game."
Phonia: In any case, I've applied for permission from the Acting Grand Master. Everyone is free to take part in these simulations, and all participants will be entitled to a thank-you gift.
Phonia: So if you have the time, Honorary Knight, I hope that you, too, will take part in our simulations. After all, I doubt that there are many in Mondstadt who know more about monsters than you do.
Traveler: I see. I'll give it a go when I have time, then.
Phonia: My thanks. We've already prepared the board, so we can begin at any time. I look forward to witnessing a commanding performance from you, Honorary Knight.
Traveler: Everyone can participate?
Phonia: The battlefield brims with uncertainty. No matter how thorough the investigation, the fog of war, which no wind can disperse, will still shroud about three-quarters of it.
Phonia: As such, the more participants we get, the more likely we can simulate even the most unpredictable of monster behavior patterns.
Phonia: All strategy and theory can only be based on real tactical results. No matter what the battle situation, only the success of our strategies can determine victory or defeat.
Phonia: Such simulations help to expose our weaknesses, such that we Knights can improve them in real future combat scenarios.
Traveler: Nice! Clear as mud, though!
Phonia: It's alright. Analyzing the simulation results is an intelligence officer's duty, Honorary Knight. You, as the commander, do not have to fret over these details. Just focus on doing battle.
Traveler: Got it. So I'll play the chess, and you'll do the rest?
Phonia: Precisely. Analyzing the simulation results is an intelligence officer's duty, Honorary Knight. You, as the commander, do not have to fret over these details — simply command.
Traveler: Well, I'll leave you to it then. See you.
Phonia: Alright. You stay safe as well.

## Talk 1

Ematol: Hmm. Perhaps for stability, tail fins might... Oh, hello there, Honorary Knight! 7th Company's Weapons Officer, Ematol, reporting for duty! What orders do you bring?
Traveler: Well, what are you doing?
Ematol: Reporting in! As per normal, I am working on new bomb structures! And... as per Phonia's request, I am "wargaming in silence, so as to spare her ears the damage"!
Traveler: Err, bomb structures, you say...?
Ematol: That's right! I mean, you must have seen the Spark Knight's lovely, gorgeous Jumpy Dumpties too, yes?
Ematol: Though I, Ematol, am just a lowly, bog-standard alchemist of no significance, I still have a dream!
Ematol: Not to delve into the structures of gold-mercury amalgams, but to achieve even a twentieth of the might bestowed upon Jumpy Dumpties by their construction!
Ematol: And that's why I've been working on an all-new design! Explosive speed — perfected! Shockwaves — shattering! Craftsmanship — simple. Cost... reasonable... Ah, I get the shivers just thinking about it...
Ematol: ...Ah, uh, sorry. Got carried away again, didn't I? Anyway, if there are any bombs... I mean, any things I can do for you, please let me know, Honorary Knight!
Traveler: Alright. I shan't disturb you, then...
Ematol: Oh, no worries, no worries! You just take care, Honorary Knight!
Traveler: Weapons Officer?
Ematol: That's right, that's me! We work in logistics, in the rear-line, so it's normal that you haven't heard of us. What we do is develop and test experimental equipment.
Ematol: For example, I'm currently designing a new long-range projectile... Anyway, if there's anything I can do for you, Honorary Knight, feel free to let me know!
Traveler: Are you taking part in the Wargame as well?
Ematol: Well, uh... To be more precise, Phonia... I mean, Commander Phonia, pulled me into this business...
Ematol: I mean, I'm not the brightest spark, so this "complicated tactics" stuff flies right over my head. I'd love nothing better than to study explosives, and follow in the Spark Knight's footsteps, setting them off, free as the wind...
Ematol: Ah, but if you need help repositioning the Wargame board, do let me know! Ematol, 7th Company Weapons Officer, shall be glad to render her services!
Traveler: It's fine, continue as you were.
Ematol: Oh, no worries, no worries! You just take care, Honorary Knight!

## Talk 2

Phonia: We meet again, Honorary Knight. As you can see, the Knights are currently piloting Wargaming simulations. If you can spare the time, we hope you can assist us in completing the testing.
Traveler: Sorry, you are...
Phonia: I'm Phonia, intelligence officer of the reorganized 7th Company, and also the one who proposed this Wargame.
Traveler: Ah, I remember now. You were the one by Cider Lake...
Phonia: Yes. My thanks for your assistance in the "Annihilate the Invasive Anglers" operation back then, Honorary Knight.
Phonia: Back then, I was still a Signals Officer of the Investigative Team, responsible for testing alchemical recon instruments developed by Captain Albedo.
Phonia: However, in light of how the Knights of Favonius have updated their tactics and the staffing structure now that some units from the expeditionary force have returned, Captain Albedo applied to have me assigned to the reorganized 7th Company.
Phonia: Regardless, I'm just an ordinary "cog" in the Knights of Favonius "machine." I'm honored that you remember me at all, in fact.
Traveler: I'm sorry, but I really don't remember you...
Phonia: It's alright. I'm just an ordinary "cog" in the Knights of Favonius "machine." There's no need to spend too much time remembering my name.
Phonia: In any case, you have my thanks for your assistance in the "Annihilate the Invasive Anglers" operation back then, Honorary Knight.
Traveler: Wargame?
Phonia: Yes. As I'm sure you've seen, the scourge of monsters wandering the wilds remains one of the issues that all nations in Teyvat must deal with.
Phonia: In short, I've drawn inspiration from the Millelith General Staff's previous methods, collating all manner of reports in order to construct this Wargame.

Traveler: Well, I'll leave you to it then. See you.
Phonia: Then we'll talk more next time, Honorary Knight.

## Talk 3

Ematol: Hmm. Perhaps for stability, tail fins might... Oh, hello there, Honorary Knight! 7th Company's Weapons Officer, Ematol, reporting for duty! What orders do you bring?
Traveler: Well, what are you doing?
Ematol: Reporting in! As per normal, I am working on new bomb structures! And... as per Phonia's request, I am "wargaming in silence, so as to spare her ears the damage"!
Ematol: Seriously, it's not like she needs to recognize voice patterns anymore! But still, she calls me noisy and asks me not to get close, saying that intel gathering is also a test for the ears... C'mon, isn't that just too much?
Traveler: And how's your work going?
Ematol: My work... Oh, you mean the development of long-range explosives? Well, it's going well! Thanks for your concern, Honorary Knight!
Ematol: As for the details... Uh, would you like the brief version or the slightly more thorough one?
Traveler: Let's have the simple spiel.
Ematol: Sure! Put simply, I've made a launcher that can pierce heavy body armor at long range. However, the launch tube has to be scrapped after a single use, and aiming is a hassle and a half...
Ematol: So, the next problem we need to solve is cost-effectiveness and accuracy. I'm not sure what to do right now, but I'll keep working on it — in the name of the Spark Knight!
Traveler: Let's hear the specifics.
Ematol: Of course, of course! Hehe, I didn't expect you to be interested in weapons development, Honorary Knight!
Ematol: First, I'm not really learned concerning archery or related mechanical devices, but when using explosives to propel projectiles, one of the easiest ways to improve range is to increase the amount of charge used.
Ematol: There's a famous saying: "If one pack of charge won't do, try two." Have you heard of it?
Ematol: Unfortunately, increasing the charge means increasing the caliber of your ammunition, which will worsen the velocity retention of said ammo. And if your ammo doesn't hit its target, you might as well have used no charge at all...
Traveler: I see...
Ematol: So I thought, perhaps we could create a nested structure within the projectile, the outer casing of which would fall away in flight so that the payload hit its target faster and more accurately, relying solely on kinetic energy to pierce armor...
Ematol: See, all we need to do is to replace the low-density propellant that originally propelled the payload with a more powerful one with several times the density, and we can push the projectile out at incredible speed...
Traveler: Ah, so that's it.
Ematol: However, the defects of such a device are also evident. The barrel and launch tube must also withstand immense pressure, and must thus be very heavy, to the point that an ordinary knight would not be able to move it...
Ematol: A weapon system that should have been carried by a single knight would then have to be dismantled into several parts for transport, and even its loading platform would have to be very sturdy just to withstand the recoil...
Ematol: Ah, I'm so sorry, great Spark Knight... When it comes down to it, my proposal is, in truth, an insult to the apex art form that is explosive weaponry...
Traveler: What in the world are you saying...
Ematol: A—Anyway! I'll stop fantasizing now. I... I need to continue our breakthroughs on the path of explosive-assisted armor-piercing munitions!
Traveler: Explosive weaponry? Apex art form!?
Traveler: I don't quite get it, but it sure sounds impressive...
Traveler: So the greater the charge, the less the power, meaning the less the charge...
Ematol: Yeah, that's about right as well!
Traveler: So you mean, the greater the charge, the less the charge...
Ematol: Uh... What? Is that... right? Well, in some sense, I guess...
Ematol: Whatever the case, I thought that we could create a nested structure within the projectile, the outer casing of which would fall away in flight so that the payload hit its target faster and more accurately. We would then rely on kinetic energy to pierce armor...
Traveler: Are you taking part in the Wargame as well?
Ematol: Well, uh... To be more precise, Phonia dragged me into this business...
Ematol: She even said something like, "You're taking part even if you don't know the first thing about chess. This is an order I'm giving you as an intelligence officer"... Seriously! She doesn't force anyone else to do things in that way, just me!
Ematol: It's abuse of authority, I say! Abuse from an abusive meanie! Almost as bad as... as a Specter, or a detonator with a signal malfunction!
Ematol: Uh, no, wait, probably not that bad... But still, very, very bad!
Ematol: *sigh* It's fine, I'll let it slide. She did help me a whole bunch back when we were working on Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades, after all...
Ematol: And this is the first time I've ever seen her working all through the night, painting those game pieces all by her own volition. Still, while we're on the topic of comparing tabletop games, wouldn't you agree that the ones I made are more enjoyable...?
Ematol: Whatever the case, just let me know if you need help repositioning the Wargame board! Ematol, 7th Company Weapons Officer, shall be glad to render her services!
Traveler: It's fine, continue as you were.
Ematol: Yup, don't you worry about me! Just let me know if there's anything you need help with, Honorary Knight!

## Talk 4

Phonia: An honor to see you again, Honorary Knight. As you can see, the Knights are currently piloting Wargaming simulations. If you can spare the time, we hope you can assist us in completing the testing.
Traveler: I remember you...
Phonia: Phonia's the name. Former Investigative Team Signals Officer, responsible for testing alchemical recon instruments developed by Captain Albedo. Presently, I'm the 7th Company's Intelligence Officer, and also the one who proposed this Wargame.
Traveler: Ah, I remember now! You were the one by Cider Lake...
Phonia: Yes. My thanks for your assistance in the "Annihilate the Invasive Anglers" operation, as well as your participation in Su Ding's Wargame of Five Armies, Honorary Knight.
Phonia: Still, I'm just an ordinary "cog" in the Knights of Favonius "machine," so I'm honored that you remember me at all.
Traveler: I'm sorry, but I really don't remember you...
Phonia: It's alright. I'm just an ordinary "cog" in the Knights of Favonius "machine." There's no need to spend too much time remembering my name.
Phonia: In any case, you have my thanks for your assistance in the "Annihilate the Invasive Anglers" operation, as well as your participation in Su Ding's Wargame of Five Armies, Honorary Knight.
Traveler: So, about this Wargame...
Phonia: Following that last joint Wargame, I referenced the methods of the Millelith General Staff to make monster chess pieces, which will be used to simulate fights between them. This will assist us in discovering the best ways of dealing with said monsters.
Phonia: It's just that I've expanded the variety of pieces based on intel received from our expedition force, such that we can simulate different combat environments.
Phonia: If we get the chance to work together again, the Knights of Favonius will share this intel with our neighboring nations, in the interest of enhancing our common security.
Traveler: I see some rare creatures indeed...
Phonia: And that is thanks to the expedition force. I doubt my imagination would have sufficed without the intel they brought back.
Phonia: Gathering intel has always been one of the most important components of our tactics, and it is also one of the most effective ways to avoid unnecessary casualties.
Phonia: It was five hundred years ago that Grand Master Arundolyn said thusly...
Phonia: Ah, sorry. I got off-topic. In any case, these game pieces were created based on the intel we gathered, and they should be enough to simulate the monsters' true abilities.
Phonia: In any case, I've applied for permission from the Acting Grand Master. Everyone is free to take part in these simulations, and all participants will be entitled to a thank-you gift.
Phonia: So if you have the time, Honorary Knight, I personally hope that you, too, will take part in our simulations. After all, I doubt that there are many in Mondstadt who know more about monsters than you do.
Traveler: I see. I'll give it a go when I have time, then.
Phonia: My thanks. We've already prepared the board, so we can begin at any time. Just as before, I look forward to learning from your commanding performance, Honorary Knight.
Traveler: You say that everyone can participate... Could you elaborate a bit?
Phonia: The battlefield brims with uncertainty. No matter how thorough the investigation, the fog of war, which no wind can disperse, will still shroud about three-quarters of it.
Phonia: As such, the more participants we get, the more likely we can simulate even the most unpredictable of monster behavior patterns.
Phonia: All strategy and theory can only be based on real tactical results. No matter what the battle situation, only the success of our strategies can determine victory or defeat.
Phonia: Such simulations help to expose our weaknesses, such that we Knights can improve them in real future combat scenarios.
Traveler: I don't get it... But I just need to play, right?
Phonia: Precisely. Analyzing the simulation results is an intelligence officer's duty, Honorary Knight. You, as the commander, do not have to fret over these details — simply command.
Phonia: During the previous joint Wargame, Turenna of Fontaine's Special Security and Surveillance Patrol mentioned a saying — "Fontaine expects that everyone will do their duty"...
Phonia: It seems to have been a famous quote from a naval commander of theirs from long ago — a most outstanding figure indeed. I am in full agreement with this view, and it applies to us Knights too, in a sense.
Phonia: From commander to soldier, so long as every "cog" in the "machine" fulfills its duty, operating in perfect accordance with orders given, we should be sufficient to ensure Mondstadt's security.
Phonia: *sigh* If only Ematol could understand this simple principle, she wouldn't give me a headache from making noise all day long...
Phonia: Well, at any rate, we've already prepared the board, so we can begin at any time. Just as before, I look forward to learning some techniques from you, Honorary Knight.
Traveler: Speaking of which, you did mention a weakness previously...
Phonia: That's right — you have an excellent memory, Honorary Knight. Our previous joint Wargame exposed our lack of strong ranged combat capabilities.
Phonia: It is difficult for our projectiles to hit highly-armored targets at a distance, but if they get close, we lose the positional advantages granted by our alchemical recon equipment.
Phonia: To solve this, I have asked the Acting Grand Master to put Ematol into the 7th Company to develop miniature explosive arrowheads or similar substitutes.
Phonia: Frankly speaking, I don't have any clue how far she's gotten, but as long as she doesn't blow my house up, I couldn't care less if she blew herself sky-high. Wouldn't be the first time she's done that.
Phonia: In terms of results, at least she's not over at Cider Lake tinkering with her bombs day-in and day-out, so that's a mental health positive for me... Even though she's still terribly noisy.
Traveler: I didn't expect you to be interested in Wargames...
Phonia: ...Ahem. I fear I must correct you, Honorary Knight. This is not merely a "Wargame," but tactical training, which I must — with the utmost enthusiasm — recommend to my fellow Knights.
Phonia: This... This is a serious measure taken to achieve a serious goal, not a mere "interest." A "cog" like myself does not have any "interests"...
Traveler: Well, I'll leave you to it then. See you.
Phonia: Don't worry, you weren't disturbing me either way. If there is anything I can help with, or if there's any intel you need me to gather, you need only ask, Honorary Knight.

## Talk 5

Ematol: Hmm. Perhaps for stability, tail fins might... Oh, hello there, Honorary Knight! 7th Company's Weapons Officer, Ematol, reporting for duty! What orders do you bring?
Traveler: Well, what are you doing?
Ematol: Reporting in! As per normal, I am working on new bomb structures! And... as per Phonia's request, I am "wargaming in silence, so as to spare her ears the damage"!

Ematol: However, the defects of such a device are also evident. The barrel and launch tube must also withstand immense pressure, and must thus be very heavy, to the point that an ordinary knight would not be able to move it...
Ematol: A weapon system that should have been carried by a single knight would then have to be dismantled into several parts for transport, and even its loading platform would have to be very sturdy just to withstand the recoil...

Ematol: Yup, don't you worry about me! Just let me know if there's anything you need help with, Honorary Knight!

## Talk 6

Phonia: Greetings, Honorary Knight. The game board has been reset. You may begin your simulations at any time.
Traveler: Could you tell me who you were, one more time...?
Phonia: Phonia. Presently the 7th Company's intelligence officer, and also the one who proposed this Wargame.
Phonia: But ultimately, I am just a "cog" in the "machine" that is the Knights of Favonius. You don't have to worry too much about my affairs, Honorary Knight.
Traveler: How's the wargaming gone?
Phonia: Rather well. Thanks to you, we've already come up with standard combat procedures for most common monsters.
Phonia: If you're interested, you'll be able to find these procedures in our library once we're done putting them together.
Phonia: But with your immense strength, I'm not entirely sure you would need these strategies, designed as they are for ordinary knights. Perhaps you might even "critique," rather than "check," them.
Phonia: In any case, until our analytic assignment ends, please feel free to perform simulations as you please, as many times as you please.
Traveler: Well, I'll leave you to it then. See you.
Phonia: Alright. You stay safe as well.

## Talk 7

Ematol: Hmm. Perhaps for stability, tail fins might... Oh, hello there, Honorary Knight! 7th Company's Weapons Officer, Ematol, reporting for duty! What orders do you bring?
Traveler: Well, what are you doing?
Ematol: Reporting in! As per normal, I am working on new bomb structures! And... as per Phonia's request, I am "wargaming in silence, so as to spare her ears the damage"!
Traveler: Err, the structure of bombs, you say...?
Ematol: That's right! I mean, you must have seen the Spark Knight's lovely, gorgeous Jumpy Dumpties too, yes?
Ematol: Though I, Ematol, am just a lowly, bog-standard alchemist of no significance, I still have a dream!
Ematol: Not to delve into the structures of gold-mercury amalgams, but to achieve even a twentieth of the might bestowed upon Jumpy Dumpties by their construction!
Ematol: And that's why I've been working on an all-new design! Explosive speed — perfected! Shockwaves — shattering! Craftsmanship — simple. Cost... reasonable... Ah, I get the shivers just thinking about it...
Ematol: ...Ah, uh, sorry. Got carried away again, didn't I? Anyway, if there are any bombs... I mean, any things I can do for you, please let me know, Honorary Knight!
Traveler: Alright. I shan't disturb you, then...
Ematol: Oh, no worries, no worries! You just take care, Honorary Knight!
Traveler: Did you gain anything useful from the simulations?
Ematol: Reporting in, Honorary Knight! I've calibrated the explosion radii of several types of bombs, and tested their effects in simulated environments! I... guess that counts, right?
Ematol: And like I said earlier, it would be ideal if we could also increase our real explosion parameters by ten times!
Ematol: I mean, I've not got the brains for complex tactics, so I'll just focus on my explosives research, you know?
Traveler: It's fine, continue as you were.
Ematol: Oh, no worries, no worries! You just take care, Honorary Knight!

## Talk 8

Phonia: Greetings, Honorary Knight. The game board has been reset. You may begin your simulations at any time.
Traveler: Could you tell me who you were, one more time...?
Phonia: I'm Phonia. Presently the 7th Company's intelligence officer, and also the one who proposed this Wargame.
Phonia: But ultimately, I am just a "cog" in the "machine" that is the Knights of Favonius.
Traveler: How's the wargaming gone?
Phonia: Rather well. Thanks to you, we've already come up with standard combat procedures for most common monsters.
Phonia: If you're interested, you'll be able to find these procedures in our library once we're done putting them together.
Phonia: But with your immense strength, I doubt you would need these strategies, designed as they are for ordinary knights. Perhaps you might even "critique," rather than "check," them.
Phonia: In any case, until our analytic assignment ends, feel free to perform simulations as you please, as many times as you please.
Traveler: Well, I'll leave you to it then. See you.
Phonia: Then we'll talk more next time, Honorary Knight.

## Talk 9

Ematol: Hmm. Perhaps for stability, tail fins might... Oh, hello there, Honorary Knight! 7th Company's Weapons Officer, Ematol, reporting for duty! What orders do you bring?
Traveler: Well, what are you doing?
Ematol: Reporting in! As per normal, I am working on new bomb structures! And... as per Phonia's request, I am "wargaming in silence, so as to spare her ears the damage"!
Ematol: Seriously, it's not like she needs to recognize voice patterns anymore! But still, she calls me noisy and asks me not to get close, saying that intel gathering is also a test for the ears... C'mon, isn't that just too much?
Traveler: And how's your work going?
Ematol: My work... Oh, you mean the development of long-range explosives? Well, it's going well! Thanks for your concern, Honorary Knight!
Ematol: As for the details... Uh, would you like the brief version or the slightly more thorough one?
Traveler: Let's have the simple spiel.
Ematol: Sure! Put simply, I've made a launcher that can pierce heavy body armor at long range. However, the launch tube has to be scrapped after a single use, and aiming is a hassle and a half...
Ematol: So, the next problem we need to solve is cost-effectiveness and accuracy. I'm not sure what to do right now, but I'll keep working on it — in the name of the Spark Knight!
Traveler: Let's hear the specifics.
Ematol: Of course, of course! Hehe, I didn't expect you to be interested in weapons development, Honorary Knight!
Ematol: First, I'm not really learned concerning archery or related mechanical devices, but when using explosives to propel projectiles, one of the easiest ways to improve range is to increase the amount of charge used.
Ematol: There's a famous saying: "If one pack of charge won't do, try two." Have you heard of it?
Ematol: Unfortunately, increasing the charge means increasing the caliber of your ammunition, which will worsen the velocity retention of said ammo. And if your ammo doesn't hit its target, you might as well have used no charge at all...
Traveler: I see...
Ematol: So I thought, perhaps we could create a nested structure within the projectile, the outer casing of which would fall away in flight so that the payload hit its target faster and more accurately, relying solely on kinetic energy to pierce armor...
Ematol: See, all we need to do is to replace the low-density propellant that originally propelled the payload with a more powerful one with several times the density, and we can push the projectile out at incredible speed...
Traveler: Ah, so that's it.
Ematol: However, the defects of such a device are also evident. The barrel and launch tube must also withstand immense pressure, and must thus be very heavy, to the point that an ordinary knight would not be able to move it...
Ematol: A weapon system that should have been carried by a single knight would then have to be dismantled into several parts for transport, and even its loading platform would have to be very sturdy just to withstand the recoil...
Ematol: Ah, I'm so sorry, great Spark Knight... When it comes down to it, my proposal is, in truth, an insult to the apex art form that is explosive weaponry...
Traveler: What in the world are you saying...
Ematol: A—Anyway! I'll stop fantasizing now. I... I need to continue our breakthroughs on the path of explosive-assisted armor-piercing munitions!
Traveler: Explosive weaponry? Apex art form!?
Traveler: I don't quite get it, but it sure sounds impressive...
Traveler: So the greater the charge, the less the power, meaning the less the charge...
Ematol: Yeah, that's about right as well!
Traveler: So you mean, the greater the charge, the less the charge...
Ematol: Uh... What? Is that... right? Well, in some sense, I guess...
Ematol: Whatever the case, I thought that we could create a nested structure within the projectile, the outer casing of which would fall away in flight so that the payload hit its target faster and more accurately. We would then rely on kinetic energy to pierce armor...
Traveler: Did you gain anything useful from the simulations?
Ematol: Well, to be honest, Honorary Knight, apart from testing the explosion radii of several different types of explosives, I'm not sure I found out much.
Ematol: I mean, I'm not the smartest when it comes to understanding complex tactics, and I can't blow things up as I please in this new game of Phonia's... I mean, not a single parameter change? Really?
Ematol: *sigh* It's fine, I'll let it slide. She did help me a whole bunch back when we were working on Dodoco's Boom-Bastic Escapades, after all...
Traveler: It's fine, continue as you were.
Ematol: Yup, don't you worry about me! Just let me know if there's anything you need help with, Honorary Knight!

## Talk 10

Phonia: Greetings, Honorary Knight. The game board has been reset. You may begin your simulations at any time.
Traveler: How's the wargaming gone?
Phonia: Rather well. Thanks to you, we've already come up with standard combat procedures for most common monsters.

Phonia: In any case, until our analytic assignment ends, feel free to perform simulations as you please, as many times as you please.
Traveler: About the weakness you mentioned before...
Phonia: Hmm. You speak of the contradiction between the "range advantage granted by alchemical recon gear" and "the significant reduction in current weapon effectiveness at long ranges."
Phonia: I discussed this issue with our Outrider after the previous joint Wargames. Our final conclusion was that our most efficient way forward is to improve the weapons themselves.
Phonia: Longer range, faster rates of fire, greater payload strength. As to how we can achieve that, I'm not so sure — that's Ematol's area of expertise.
Phonia: Sure, she's dumb and noisy, her head has nothing in it besides explosives, she often falls behind on rent, and she can't even cook, but when it comes to weapons development, she knows her duty as a "cog."
Phonia: So I choose to trust her judgment. No matter what she gets up to, I will... provide support, within reason.
Phonia: That said, I must confess that this idea of "digging a cone-shaped cavity inside bombs to increase their explosive power" sounds like a load of hogwash...
Traveler: Well, I'll leave you to it then. See you.
Phonia: Don't worry, you weren't disturbing me either way. If there is anything I can help with, or if there's any intel you need me to gather, you need only ask, Honorary Knight.
Traveler: Well, I'll leave you to it then. See you.
Phonia: Don't worry, you weren't disturbing me either way. If there is anything I can help with, or if there's any intel you need me to gather, you need only ask, Honorary Knight.
