Traveler: What is this place?
Ezana: Here, we sell masks in the styles of all the different tribes. Let me know if you see anything you like the look of.
Ezana: In the extremely unlikely event that none of our pre-made masks take your fancy, we also have materials for you to make your own.
Ezana: If you make one yourself, you'll only be charged the cost of the materials.

Traveler: When do you usually wear a mask?
Ezana: You can wear a mask whenever you feel like it.
Ezana: But normally, you'll see more people wearing them on holidays.
Ezana: Also, when there's a competition, many people wear the masks of the tribe they support as a way of cheering on their warriors.
Ezana: But normally, you can just wear it as a fancy accessory.
