# Delicious Gilded Tajine

A stewed meat dish. The large chunks of meat have been steeped in the thick, rich soup, and they melt away the instant they touch your lips. The unique spice blend dances along with the rhythm of the meat aromas, playing the desert's tune upon your taste buds, with your tongue helpless but to applaud.
