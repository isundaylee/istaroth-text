Kun: Ah, the Jade Chamber... To think that it could truly be rebuilt...
Traveler: What are you doing over here?
Kun: Ah, it's you. I... Well, I'm currently thinking about how to clear up the flotsam out there in the ocean...
Kun: You remember how the Jade Chamber crashed and was completely destroyed, right? It left a ton of floating wreckage in its wake...
Kun: The Ministry of Civil Affairs organized several rounds of cleanup, but those tiny pieces have proved all but impossible to clear away...
Kun: Now, the Jade Chamber has been rebuilt, and yet you can still find flotsam coming in on the tides now and then. That's really turning into a problem for us.
Kun: Our superiors have been chasing us to finish the cleanup faster.
Kun: Our sergeant said that I could look for some people to help out, but seriously, who would want to do this job anyway?
Kun: But well, you know, if you've got the time... Could you give us a hand with the cleanup efforts?
Traveler: You can count on me.
Kun: Thanks, you're a big help. I'm afraid that I'm not particularly adept in the water...
