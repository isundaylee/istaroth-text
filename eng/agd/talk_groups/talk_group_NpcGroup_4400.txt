Traveler: Steady there, Mr. Enthusiastic...
Isak: Ah, I... Sorry, I didn't mean to bother you...
Isak: But you saved Grandpa, and that makes you our family's hero! Thank you so much!
Isak: Ever since that incident, I've been thinking that I should work harder so I can help my Grandpa, just like you did!
Isak: Miss Candace always says that I should be thankful to those who've helped me and that I should learn from them.

Traveler: Maybe next time.
Isak: Alright. You're always welcome here!

## Talk

Traveler: That's very true.
Isak: Alright!
Isak: But Dehya tells me that I should be patient 'cause I'm still young, and that I should start small and learn to live independently first before learning to take care of my Grandpa.
Isak: And that's why I've started cooking for myself lately! I've practiced a few times, and I think it came out alright. Wanna try some?
