Legba: Ah! Ha, so it's you. How've things been going? Well, I trust?
Legba: If you're tired, you can rest up here. And you can rest easy, for I will keep watch.
Traveler: About the young Saurians with marks on their heads...
Legba: #Ah, you mean the mark on {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}'s head?
Legba: I've heard that young Saurians with such marks are far stronger than their peers... Though, it's probably no more than a rumor. Sorry, I don't really know much about Saurians.
Traveler: About manifestations of the Wayob's will...
Legba: It is said to be a thread of the Wayob's will. Many in the tribe have seen them, and as they say, "They've got their own reasons for appearing aboveground."
Legba: Stuff like... An obsidian statue being stolen, ha!
Legba: But mostly, tribespeople opt to sneak past them. Ah, though they do often appear in the tales of storytellers...
Legba: They test the brave with trials, punish the greedy, or guide heroes onto the right path... stuff like that.
Traveler: It's nothing, I was just on my way...
Legba: Very well then. Safe travels.
