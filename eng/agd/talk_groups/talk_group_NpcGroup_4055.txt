Traveler: And you are...
Jut: I'm a spice merchant. I mainly provide locals with spices for their daily needs, but I also sell some spiced-up side dishes.
Jut: Some researchers even come personally to gather the spices.
Jut: I even got a source for rare Padisarahs through a friend in the Eremites. Come to me if you need some.

Jut: No problem, come back any time.

## Talk

Traveler: I see someone's pretty well connected.
Jut: Hehe, you flatter me... It's just that I often sent gifts to my guests when I first started out, so they were willing to tell others about my store to help my business.
Jut: Business is all about treating people with sincerity, you know.
Jut: Is this your first time here? Here, take these. I hope they can bring a different flavor to your table.
