Traveler: New mission, Chitose?
Chitose: Fine. I can tell you â€” I do still owe you, after all. Hmph. Would make it easier for you to watch your own back, too. You've got Fatui enemies everywhere, after all.
Chitose: I'm still investigating that "Teacher" character. We captured one of his aides, and "persuaded" him to provide us with some interesting information.
Chitose: This "Teacher" was originally an instructor at the House of the Hearth. When the title of "The Knave" changed hands, he broke off with some unsuspecting subordinates and pursued the previous Knave's directives.
