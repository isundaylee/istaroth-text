Iwata: Another failure... What sort of seeds should I try next time, hmm?
Hirai: You've tried this many times already, but nothing grows here for long. Aren't you ready to give up yet?
Hirai: The soil here on Watatsumi Island has never been suited to farming. We've only gotten some carrots to grow at the most, and I doubt even Sumeru fertilizers could help us here. Seriously, just give up already.
Hirai: Even if you can't go out to sea with me on account of your old injuries, you can still do some other work.
Iwata: No! How can we allow ourselves to be beaten down by adversity so easily? Never, I say! I will find something that can grow on this land.
Iwata: I should really be asking *you* why you keep wandering around the village. Weren't you gonna go out and catch some fish?
Hirai: Fish? Of course I'm going to do that!
Hirai: It's just that I caught sight of some strange ships when I went out recently. They seemed to be from another land...
Hirai: The sight of them left me rather ill at ease, and I thought that I'd exercise more caution out at sea in the future...
