# Talk Dialog

Sumac: We meet again! How have you been?
Traveler: Not bad. You?
Sumac: Things have been pretty good lately! It was only after I came here that I realized I wasn't doing too badly in the first place. Everyone's so kind, and they've given me loads of helpful advice and encouragement.
Sumac: Hehe, seems like leaving my hometown had its silver lining after all!
Traveler: We've had some slight hitches...
Sumac: Ah, I see... Well, I wish I could give you some advice, but the truth is, you've seen far more of the world than I have, so I don't think it would help.
Sumac: Maybe you should just put aside your worries for now and have some fun. Like getting something nice to eat, a dip in a hot spring, and a good night's sleep!
Sumac: Your problems will still be there when you wake up, sure, but at least you'll face them full of energy, right?
Traveler: Anyway, about what happened before...
Sumac: I hadn't expected this many twists in the tale... In the end, it's hard to say who was right and who was wrong. Perhaps things were more complicated than I thought.
Traveler: Let's chat again sometime.
Sumac: Alright then, take care!
