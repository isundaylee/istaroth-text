Traveler: Who are you?
Kun: Don't recognize me? I just transferred here from the south wharf.
Kun: I'm going to miss my time there. I always found watching the boats going in and out the harbor quite awe-inspiring somehow.
Kun: Not so much the cargo ships and fishing boats. I mean more the ones that belong to The Crux. I know they are involved in some shady stuff, but...
Kun: ...None of that's any of my business really. If everyone above me's happy enough to let it slide, it's hardly my place to be critical.
