Mavuika: This makes me imagine a huge feast... Everyone raising their glasses, enjoying some good food, and letting their hair down.
Mavuika: We've got the venue, we've got the feast... All that's missing is a bit of healthy competition.
Mavuika: To have a proper feast, you need a reason to celebrate â€” just like you can't have drinks without some snacks. That's what sets the mood, and allows everyone to fully enjoy themselves.
