# The Floral Courtyard: Part II


## Talk 1

Fushizome: We meet again, you two.
Fushizome: The previous "floral courtyard" was a pleasure to behold indeed. You are both most talented, to have grasped the essence of the art so quickly.
Fushizome: The new theme awaits your perusal.
Traveler: Well, let's begin, then.
Paimon: Yup! We're ready as can be!
Fushizome: Haha, such a vivid sparkle there in your eyes, almost like they reflect a radiant sea of flowers. Most lovely indeed...
Fushizome: In that case, today's theme is slightly harder than the last one, all the better for you to refine your craft with...
Fushizome: "Silken and sturdy, the lotus in the pond."
Fushizome: Ponder the meaning of this theme and select your flowers carefully to form a most special "floral courtyard."
Traveler: I've got some other things to do at the moment...
Fushizome: That's alright. Ikebana requires one's full attention, after all.
Fushizome: Once you have completed the various tasks you have on hand, rendering yourself free of disturbances, I'm certain that your floral courtyard shall be all the more perfect for it.

## Talk 2

Fushizome: In the following days, I will continue to stay here and guide those who come for the Irodori Festival, and help them to enjoy the beauty of the "floral courtyards."
Fushizome: Don't forget to drop by every day to get another "theme." There will be a total of four such themes for you to figure out.
Fushizome: Of course, if you have any other questions, I will do my best to answer them for you.
Traveler: About the flowers here...
Fushizome: The flowers I use are all provided by Sakuya's Flowers. The flowers they grow are of impeccable quality and affordable prices.
Fushizome: Perhaps you've met Sakuya as well. We once studied ikebana under the same master.
Fushizome: Sakuya is also very well-studied in the floral arts, but when she heard that there would be tons of people at the Irodori Festival, she seemed to have gotten a bit of stage fright. She said that it would be difficult to quiet down and focus on her work in such an environment.
Fushizome: In any case, I will advertise Sakuya's Flowers on her behalf.
Paimon: We can help too if you need us!
Fushizome: Well then, do the two of you have any other questions?
Traveler: Thank you, Ms. Fushizome.
Fushizome: Think nothing of it. If you have time, you can come and look for me any time.
Traveler: About the Yashiro Commission's involvement...
Fushizome: The Yashiro Commission has always been very supportive of Inazuma's floral arts. Indeed, the person who sponsored this event is the Shirasagi Himegimi.
Fushizome: She has always been incredibly talented in these arts, even from a young age. I saw her perform ikebana once, and even had the honor of exchanging pointers with her.
Fushizome: Although I'm older than her, I'm nowhere near her ability in terms of skill in ikebana or understanding of the floral arts.
Fushizome: Where circumstances have permitted, she has provided funding to help publicize ikebana every year. I've even heard that she has used her own savings to do so...
Fushizome: She once expressed her frank desire for more people to understand ikebana and to drum up more interest in it such that more might want to practice this art.
Paimon: Huh. So Ayaka did so much for Inazuma's floral arts...
Traveler: I hope her wish comes true.
Fushizome: Thank you both. You are indeed good-hearted people.
Traveler: I have no further questions at the moment.
Fushizome: Alright, then. You can come and look for me any time.
