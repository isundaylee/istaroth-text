# The Five Kasen's Splendor: Akahito

A sheet of paper that some mysterious person left behind. This person must have originally intended to leave it on Kazuha's person, only to be unexpectedly detected by the latter and forced to flee in a hurry, leaving the sheet behind. A poem entitled "The Five Kasen's Splendor: Akahito" is written upon it.
