# Lotus Eater


## Talk 1

Supada no Hiko: Never give up, children. Hope is amongst you...
Supada no Hiko: Is that you? Children? Have you succeeded, my children?
Supada no Hiko: No... I can feel it. You are not...
Paimon: #Traveler, this person seems to have gone blind before becoming an afterimage...
Supada no Hiko: Whoever you are, please, could you help me? Help me find my children! I must tell them something.
Traveler: Uhh, first off, who are you?
Supada no Hiko: My... my name is...
Supada no Hiko: I've... forgotten my name...
Supada no Hiko: I only remember... I once stood forward for Byakuyakoku, and I fought for hope.
Supada no Hiko: To this day, I remain a member of the resistance.
Paimon: But what would you be resisting down here in Byakuyakoku?
Supada no Hiko: Those filthy, holier-than-thou nobles, of course!
Supada no Hiko: They claim to have received some divine decree and fly the flag of the gods, but they only seek to satiate their base desires!
Supada no Hiko: Ostensibly, they guard the Sunchild. But in truth, they are the real rulers of the nation — parasitic worms who suck the flesh and blood of the people!
Supada no Hiko: They must. Be. Destroyed.
Paimon: You remember all this so well, but you don't even remember your name...
Supada no Hiko: This only goes to show how cruel their methods are!
Supada no Hiko: I was captured after our previous failure, imprisoned here in this altar, and tortured.
Supada no Hiko: This prison is a malignant thing. Even now, I can feel my soul being ground down, precious things stripped away from me...
Supada no Hiko: Please, kind soul, I beg you! While I still yet remember, help me find my children!
Supada no Hiko: Tell them to never give up, for hope lives amongst them...
Traveler: Your children?
Supada no Hiko: There is a group of bright young minds who follow me willingly. They are my students, and our reserve force. I see them as my own children.
Supada no Hiko: Those wicked people at the top used all manner of ways to pry my mouth open and force me to give those children up, but I did not.
Supada no Hiko: After all, I know that hope lives amongst them...
Paimon: They're probably all gone by this point...
Supada no Hiko: No, never! They are good children. They will surely hold on to our ideals.
Supada no Hiko: I haven't given up... nor do I believe that they have, either.
Traveler: How will we find them?
Supada no Hiko: I remember that. Surely, I do...
Supada no Hiko: Let me tell you where they are hiding.
Paimon: But if we do find them, how will we explain ourselves to them?
Paimon: "We came here because a resistance member who has forgotten his name told us to?"
Supada no Hiko: No, that will not do. I have taught them well. Unless you prove yourselves, they will not trust you.
Supada no Hiko: But I cannot even recall my own name... Curses!
Paimon: #This guy seems like he was once a wanted criminal in Byakuyakoku, Traveler — the kind you'd write into the history books.
Paimon: Paimon bets that it shouldn't be hard for us to find some record of him. We might even find some nearby!
Supada no Hiko: If history should recall my name, I pray that that history may be written by those who inherit our will.

## Talk 2

Supada no Hiko: Have you found anything concerning my identity?

## Talk 3

Supada no Hiko: You... Who are you? You sound quite familiar...
Paimon: Eh? You've forgotten us already? Oh no, you're in worse shape than Paimon thought...
Supada no Hiko: Thank you. Are we truly acquainted?
Traveler: We just met, actually.
Supada no Hiko: Ah, yes, I remember. In this place, your very soul shall be eroded. My memories must have been ground away too severely.
Supada no Hiko: I'm sorry, I... *sigh*
Supada no Hiko: Did you manage to find anything useful, then?
Traveler: Is your name Supada no Hiko?
Supada no Hiko: Supada no Hiko... Right... Yes, that's correct! I'm the leader of the resistance, Spartacus!
Paimon: Ooh, so they're both your name, then? As expected of an awesome leader, you've even got two names!
Supada no Hiko: Thank you so much for returning my name to me. I seem to have remembered some other things as well.
Supada no Hiko: ...
Supada no Hiko: "After the sun, the darkness starts, but true light hides within our hearts."
Traveler: What's that?
Supada no Hiko: This is our secret pass-code.
Supada no Hiko: Now that I have my name back, my memories are returning as well. This should be our pass-code.
Supada no Hiko: Now let me tell you where my children are hidden.
Traveler: Do you have any message you'd like me to pass along?
Supada no Hiko: Let me think...
Supada no Hiko: Tell them this for me: never give up, for the hope of Byakuyakoku lives amongst them.
Traveler: Would you like me to bring them here to see you?
Supada no Hiko: No. Never.
Supada no Hiko: Our only advantage is that the enemy is in the open, while we are in the shadows. The hearts of Byakuyakoku's people are all with us, and we must not reveal ourselves so cheaply.
Supada no Hiko: Moreover, I cannot remember every single one of their names. I mean, I even forgot my own...
Supada no Hiko: So yes, tell them to never give up, for the hope of Byakuyakoku lives amongst them.
Traveler: If they are no longer there...
Supada no Hiko: No. That will not happen. As long as the corrupt leaders who control the Sunchild are still in place, they will always be there. The resistance will continue to endure.
Supada no Hiko: Bring my admonishment to them: to never give up, for the hope of Byakuyakoku lives amongst them.
Supada no Hiko: That will be enough.
Traveler: Is your name Supada the Bandit?
Paimon: Oh, come on! It's Supada no Hiko!
Traveler: We were just looking for your identity.

## Talk 4

Adonis: Who are you?
Adonis: Leave. You shouldn't be here.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Are these the waters of Lethe?
Paimon: They don't look like anything special, never mind like something magical...
Paimon: Well, here goes nothing. Let's just grab some.

## Talk 6

Paimon: It feels like there's been some change. All we can do now is wait.
Paimon: Let's come back later and have a look.

## Talk 7

Adonis: Who are you?
Adonis: Leave. You shouldn't be here.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Uhh, this reads... "The Bandit, Supada no Hiko"?
Paimon: Uh, no, it should just be "Supada no Hiko." That's that man's name! Let's go tell him, quick!

## Talk 9

Traveler: After the sun, the true light starts...
Adonis: The what with the what now? Get out of here!

## Talk 10

Traveler: After the sun, the darkness starts...
Adonis: ...But true light hides... within our hearts.
Adonis: ...I'd almost forgotten. It's been so long since I've heard this phrase.
Adonis: Tell me, my good comrade, who sent you?
Traveler: Supada no Hiko.
Adonis: Master Spartacus!? Master sent you!?
Adonis: Where is he? I only know that he was captured during the uprising by the henchmen of the Sunchild. We lost all contact with him after that.
Paimon: He's been locked in the altar at the Serpent's Heart, and judging by how things look, he can't get out. That's why he sent us to look for you.
Adonis: That accursed Sunchild...
Adonis: What instructions did Master entrust you with?
Paimon: He just asked us to carry a message.
Paimon: "Never give up, children. The hope of Byakuyakoku lives amongst you."
Adonis: ...
Adonis: ...
Adonis: I... I'm sorry! We have failed you, Master!
Traveler: What's the matter?
Adonis: The resistance is no more.
Paimon: Eh!?
Adonis: After Master was captured, the backbone of the resistance collapsed utterly.
Adonis: Only those of us students who followed him ordinarily escaped thanks to being far from the center of events.
Adonis: Afterward, those of us who were lucky enough to get away fled to our pre-prepared hiding places, hoping to muster our strength once more.
Adonis: We have excellent strategists, professional scholars, skilled mystics, and reliable doctors amongst us...
Paimon: Well, that sounds promising!
Adonis: That's what we thought too. Given time, we believed that we could revitalize the movement.
Adonis: But all these things needed funds... which we didn't have any of.
Adonis: Finally, someone suggested that we sell Dragonbone Orbs.
Traveler: What's a Dragonbone Orb?
Adonis: It is a rare fruit that Dragonbone Flowers will bear under special circumstances.
Adonis: Its fragrance can relax the mind and calm anxious thoughts, sweeping all of one's worries away. As such, it can fetch a very high price on the market.
Paimon: Is it really that mystical? You sure this isn't a scam?
Adonis: I only wish it were all a lie... Naive as I was, I did not perceive the perils that lay down that path.
Adonis: I do not know where the formula came from, but I do know that it did earn us a lot of capital.
Adonis: Everything was going so well... But soon, we discovered that some of our comrades suddenly began to avoid conflict and reject the idea of going into battle...
Adonis: The number of such people increased by the day, to the point where they requested to leave our ranks. I was unable to stop them...
Paimon: How did this happen? Is this because the orbs earned you and your comrades so much money that most people lost the will to fight on?
Adonis: Do you mean the corrupting allure of money? No... I... I don't know.
Adonis: I only know that when oppressed peoples grow satisfied with their lives, they cease to resist.
Adonis: That was where the collapse started, and once it began, there was no stopping it.
Adonis: Sometimes, I actually wonder if the formula for making these things wasn't leaked to us by those despicable rulers...
Adonis: Sometimes I wonder if the best-selling nature of these orbs wasn't all a false pretense created by those despicable rulers...?
Adonis: *sigh* If Master had been there, I'm sure that he would have been able to control the situation. He might even have nipped it in the bud right from the start.
Adonis: I'm sorry, Master. We could not become hope...
Traveler: I'm very sorry to hear that.
Adonis: I cannot face him like this...
Adonis: But still, you have my thanks for bringing news of him.
Adonis: I do not have anything with which I can thank you. But if you do not mind, allow me to tell you the secret of the Dragonbone Orbs.
Adonis: They can only be created through the use of the waters of Tokoyo Reisen, that is to say, the waters of Lethe.
Adonis: Perhaps you might be able to exchange it for some money, or keep it for yourself.
Adonis: Still, be wary. Keep your desire to press onward about you.
Traveler: Would you like to see your Master?

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

An Ancient Stone Tablet: (There are two rows of text on this headstone. The first row is in the script of Byakuyakoku and is unintelligible.)
An Ancient Stone Tablet: The second row is in the common script, and it reads as follows:
An Ancient Stone Tablet: "Here lies Spartacus the Righteous, known now as Supada no Hiko. Beneath lies the litany of his crimes. Read them and remember our history."
An Ancient Stone Tablet: "Supada no Hiko, the notorious outlaw, mastermind of great crimes, and the root of unrest. Now in the name of Tokoyo Ookami, may his sight be cut off, and may his soul be crushed. May he be thrown into a deep prison, now and forever."
