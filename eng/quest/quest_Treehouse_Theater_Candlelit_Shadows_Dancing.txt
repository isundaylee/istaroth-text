# Treehouse Theater: Candlelit Shadows Dancing


## Talk 1

Idyia: Really!? You'd do that? Oh, but that's too much, I can't...
Collei: No, really. It's alright, we want to do everything we can for the domain.
Lessig: Yes, and to be completely fair, I'm the one who caused this terrible mess in the first place.
Paimon: Oh? What happened? Did Paimon miss something?
Eula: Hello, you two. Lessig was just telling us what happened.
Lessig: Perhaps you should allow me to explain.
Lessig: Ahem, I'm afraid it was I who caused all this trouble in the domain.
Idyia: *sigh* Yes, it was Lessig...
Lessig: To be precise, I saw a most exquisite water orb at the entrance of the domain. It reminded me of an astrolabe my grandfather gave me when I was seven years old...
Lessig: I was curious if it could rotate, so I reached out and touched it.
Lessig: Little did I know that it was the core of this entire domain. Ahem, what I mean to say is... I knew something was wrong as soon as the whole place started flipping...
Idyia: It's not just your fault, I failed in my responsibilities as the caretaker here. *sigh* I knew I should have put the core somewhere more secure.
Paimon: Oh, you mean the big ball of water at the entrance?
Collei: Yes, that's the one. Anyway, after giving it some thought, Lessig has offered to perform some more repairs and maintenance to help support the domain.
Collei: But we were concerned he wouldn't be able to handle it all alone, so Eula and I will also stay here to lend him a hand.
Eula: But don't be mistaken, I'm not doing this out of the kindness of my heart like Collei. My job is purely to monitor and ensure that Lessig doesn't cause any more trouble here.
Paimon: Oh, sure...
Collei: I don't think anyone's buying that anymore, Eula. Though I do remember that Amber mentioned we should just nod and agree when you act like this...
Eula: Ahem...!
Collei: Ah, right! Uh, you better not slack off today, Lessig!
Lessig: Ah, no! I'll get right to work!
Eula: Hmph... Either way, Lessig is going to be in charge of making lunch for everyone today.
Traveler: That'll give him a chance to redeem himself.
Lessig: Yes, I'll do my best. No need to worry!
Eula: What was that?
Lessig: Oh, I mean... thanks everyone for giving me a chance to redeem myself. I can already feel new strength kindled inside me! Ah no, maybe that's just the heat of the oven!
Idyia: Very good, but you should conserve your strength. Many parts of the domain are still in disrepair, so we have a lot to investigate.
Paimon: Seems Idyia has a little more pep in her step after finding others to help do the work.
Idyia: Now that you three are situated, we can focus on what the rest of us will be doing today!
Idyia: I'll go gather the others. We should get ready to leave as soon as possible.
Paimon: And there she goes... At least she seems to be happy.
Collei: Maybe this is how it feels to be in charge.
Black Screen Text: After waiting for a while, you head to the location of the final component together with Klee, Kaeya, and Kokomi, whom Idyia called over.
Traveler: It'd better be good!
Lessig: Hmm? Ah, yes... I'll try, but I'm not sure if my skills will prove satisfactory...

## Talk 2

Idyia: The director doesn't get out much, he's almost always cooped up in his tree house making props or writing scripts...
Idyia: But I'm trying to remember now... where is that tree house of his?
Klee: Huh? You don't remember?
Idyia: Hey, don't forget... I'm just the Mascot, hehe...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I believe it's that way.
Idyia: Huh...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Though he might prefer to be alone, given he often has to move stage props, I suspect that he lives near the theater.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: And having a view of the entire stage would be useful when imagining a production's actual stage flow.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: So, if I were him, I'd probably pick a treehouse over there.
Idyia: But, how do you know which direction the theater is in?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Oh, simple. The overall layout and decorations look more exciting in that direction.
Idyia: Oh, good point! Why didn't I think of that...?

## Talk 3

Zosimos: Where did that blasted automation mechanism go...? The male actors' standees are here, but where are the female ones...
Zosimos: Hmm? Who's that... Idyia?
Idyia: Yes, Zosimos. 'Tis I, Idyia! ...How's that for a dramatic entrance?
Zosimos: This is a surprise. I was sure you'd be—
Paimon: "Curled up in a fetal position crying to yourself"?
Zosimos: Wow, what a fascinating little creature... Did you just read my mind?
Paimon: The name's Paimon. And no, Paimon's no mind-reader... Just call it an educated guess.
Zosimos: Haha, it seems everyone shares a similar opinion about you, Idyia.
Idyia: I knew from the start that a managerial role wasn't for me... But I've found my true calling now. As a mascot.
Zosimos: "Mascot"? Is that a new role? I don't remember casting you for that...
Idyia: Okay, enough about me. I'm just here to introduce you to some new friends of mine.
Black Screen Text: Idyia introduces everyone to Zosimos and explains all that has happened...
Idyia: ...And that's why we came to see you! Well? Do you have the component that fell out of the Central Hub?
Zosimos: I do, however...
Zosimos: I'm afraid the incident has caused many malfunctions with the stage mechanisms, and I can no longer put on any performances...
Paimon: Okay, so you're holding the component ransom till we help you fix the mechanisms, huh?
Idyia: No. Till we fix the stage, surely?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I'd have thought he wants us to make some more props, no? Given that some of the standees are missing?
Klee: Or maybe the component is broken, and we need to fix it!
Kaeya: You're all forgetting that the majority of his work involves writing scripts. I'll wager that he wants us to edit them.
Traveler: Who started this guessing game, anyway?
Zosimos: ...What has gotten into you all? What sort of person do you take me for!? The component is safe and sound — I can give it to you now if you like.
Zosimos: Although I was hoping that maybe you might be willing to... help rescue my show.
Zosimos: You're a big group, I have lots of roles to fill... It would really speed up the casting.
Klee: A show? Hee-hee, that sounds fun!
Klee: I wanna help! Can we, can we?
Traveler: So far so good...
Zosimos: Also... Truth be told, I've hit a bit of a roadblock in my script and was just thinking about how to move the story forward... And then you all showed up.
Zosimos: Suddenly, I got my muse back! I don't know how to explain it, but... something about seeing all of you finally helped me figure out how to continue my script!
Idyia: Huh? You mean that story you've been stuck on forever? Are you serious? You really think you can finish it now?
Zosimos: Yes! Really! Just give me a little time, and I'll write it all up! In the meantime, I'll leave things to you, Idyia.
Black Screen Text: Idyia's mouth is wide open as she watches Zosimos rush to the corner, panting up a storm as he whips out his pen and starts penning his script...
Paimon: Whoa, and he's off to write the script...
Idyia: *sigh* Zosimos has always wanted to write an epic story about a thief and a mage. Apparently, he got the idea from some rumors that were swirling around, but he only got as far as writing the intro before writers' block set in...
Idyia: Why don't you all take some time for yourselves while I see what I can do? We'll reconvene after the director finishes his script.
Black Screen Text: Some time later, Zosimos flies in brandishing a stack of scripts to hand out to everyone.
Black Screen Text: Everyone is astonished that he finished an entire script in such a short time.
Zosimos: A director, my friends, is a storyteller. And the key ingredient to every good story is inspiration! The moment I laid eyes on General Sangonomiya, inspiration hit me for a brand new character.
Zosimos: The heroine was the missing piece of the puzzle. The rest of the story flowed naturally from there, and now it's finished! So please, take a look through your scripts, and we will tell this story together!
Black Screen Text: Everyone reads their scripts as Zosimos gives pointers about how it will play out on the stage...
Zosimos: Well? Is everything clear?
Klee: Uh, Director Zosimos? How do you pronounce this word?
Kaeya: Let me see... Ah, that's "sojourn," it means to stay for a while. This is a very cute moment, so make sure that comes through in the performance.
Klee: Oh wait, there's another word I don't know here...
Kaeya: It's okay, Klee. We can go through your lines together a few more times after this meeting's over.
Zosimos: That would be most appreciated, Kaeya. I had a feeling about you, actually. You seem to know a thing or two about character acting. Tell me, have you acted before?
Kaeya: Haha, you're too kind. It's all in the script, really. It just rolls off the tongue.
Zosimos: Oh, you think so? Well, you definitely have a knack for it. I've actually been looking out for someone with your talent.
Zosimos: If I make it as a big time director, then I can see us working together for the long term! Be sure to stay in touch, okay? You and I are gonna go places...
Kaeya: What can I say? Sounds good to me.
Zosimos: Great, fantastic... Now then, please go through your scripts one more time — but don't just read the words. Remember my notes, and really let the character inhabit you. I need to have a look at the stage, so I'll leave you to it.
Zosimos: If you need me for anything, I'll be in the big theater right in the center of this area.
Traveler: Just let the man speak!

## Talk 4

Zosimos: ...Huh? Where did it go? I put it right here...
Paimon: Hey, Zosimos! Whatcha up to?
Zosimos: Oh, it's you two.
Zosimos: Please, come here. Feast your eyes on this stage! I designed it myself.
Traveler: It looks great!
Paimon: So directors have to design the stage, too?
Zosimos: Haha, I'm no ordinary director. I take a more holistic approach... Directing, script writing, stage design... I do it all!
Paimon: Sounds like a lot of work. Idyia wouldn't be able to handle that kind of job.
Zosimos: Idyia has her work cut out for her too, you know. She's my one and only member of the audience... Though she often criticizes my shows...
Traveler: She has the gall to sit there and criticize you?
Zosimos: Well, she just says what she thinks. "You don't know how to write," or "this is getting ridiculous"... I think it's because I use preprints in a way that she feels goes against what they're intended for.
Zosimos: But even though she's my harshest critic, she's also been my biggest supporter in a lot of ways. I guess you could say she's like my agent.
Zosimos: I'm very grateful to her. I've always dreamed of being a director, but I never had the chance until I came here.
Paimon: So what did you do before you came here?
Zosimos: Like I said... I dreamed, heh.
Zosimos: From a young age, every time I came home after a show, I'd go over the story again and again in my mind. Growing up, my biggest aspiration was to be a director.
Zosimos: Unfortunately, I couldn't offer much beyond my practical skills... so I ended up spending most of my time as a prop designer, and doing a bit of set design on the side.
Zosimos: Don't get me wrong, I do love building the set, but... nothing satisfies me more than putting on my very own show.
Paimon: No wonder you only wrote "director" on the sign.
Zosimos: Haha, exactly... You're not doing a great job of convincing me that you're not a mind-reader.
Zosimos: By the way, could I ask for your help with something? I'm having trouble finding the master script, and I'll need it shortly.
Paimon: The one you only just finished writing? You lost it already?
Zosimos: Yeah... After I handed everyone their copies, I held onto my master copy while I was checking on everything around the theater... I must've dropped it somewhere.
Zosimos: But, uh... I still have some things to do to get the stage ready. Would you two mind having a look for me?
Zosimos: If it's not here, then it might be in the attic. These are the only two places I've been since I finished writing it.
Traveler: Sure.
Paimon: No problem. We'll find it.
Traveler: Impressive!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Zosimos, we got your script!
Zosimos: Ah, thank you! That's a huge help. *sigh* ...I'm running out of time here, there's no way I'll be able to fix everything up perfectly. We may just have to wing it.
Zosimos: Anyway, the stage is secondary — the performance is what really matters. Things can always go wrong on stage, but as long as the show goes on... it should be fine...
Paimon: You don't sound very confident in what you're saying...
Zosimos: It's true! I realize now that a show is the art of the unknown!
Zosimos: Even if you have the same actors performing on the same stage, the performance will be slightly different every time. Those subtle differences are what make each performance special!
Traveler: You sure about that?
Zosimos: #Ugh... Okay, one last request. {NICKNAME}, you can enter the preprints, yes?
Zosimos: The truth is that my sets are composed entirely of preprints... First, I use materials to make the objects, then I take those objects and turn them into the preprint.
Zosimos: Now, of course, preprints are really meant for making objects to furnish the domain. So using objects to create preprints is, strictly speaking, the reverse of what this is intended for.
Zosimos: But Idyia said that if this is what I really want to do, she's not going to stand in my way...
Paimon: Ah, so that's what you meant earlier... Okay, well, what do you need us to do?
Zosimos: #I'd like {NICKNAME} to go into the preprints set and help move props around during the performance...
Traveler: So I'm part of the backstage crew now...
Zosimos: The reason is, um... Heh...
Traveler: You want to watch the show.
Zosimos: ...
Paimon: Ahhh, Paimon gets it now. If you're busy directing, moving the props, and operating all the mechanisms, you never get the chance to watch the show...
Zosimos: ...Yes. I know that I'm no master-playwright, but still...
Zosimos: Even if it really is a half-baked script, with shoddy writing, and moments of sheer ridiculousness... I'd still like to see it for myself, just once.
Paimon: Hard to turn a guy down after a speech like that...
Traveler: We're more than happy to help!
Zosimos: Thank you! Genuinely, I'm so grateful! I'll go and inform the others, then — as soon as you're ready, the show can begin!
Traveler: I'm literally going "behind the scenes"...
Traveler: You have a point, but I'm not completely convinced.

## Talk 6

Hydro Eidolon: Gurgle!
Paimon: Wow, this is a lot of scripts...
Paimon: Looks like the Water Droplet has been managing them for the director...
Paimon: Hmm, most of them look like works in progress...
Traveler: Okay. Well, we're looking for a master script, so...
Paimon: Ah, then it should be the one that's finished! Okay, so let's look for the thickest one, and then check the ending...
Paimon: This is the only script that fits the bill, plus it looks pretty new... This must be the master script.
Paimon: Let's go give it to Director Zosimos!

## Talk 7

Zosimos: The thicket board's mechanism should be functioning... Let's see, there's the lights... Oh, and the microphones...

## Talk 8

Paimon: And we're done! Seems the show went pretty well.
Klee: #{M#Mr.}{F#Miss} Honorary Knight!
Klee: Didn't I do great? I felt like I really was the fiery mage!
Paimon: Wow, great costume, Klee!
Paimon: As soon as Paimon saw your shadow, she thought straight away: What a cute hat!
Traveler: It's the role you were born to play!
Klee: Klee loves it! Thanks, Mr. Zosimos!
Klee: Wait, no! I mean, uh... Mr. Director!
Zosimos: Mr. Director...?
Zosimos: Wow! No one's ever called me that before! Thank you, my dear little mage, thank you so much! I'm so happy!
Klee: Miss Idyia said that she tailored it a little bit so it would fit me, but you were the one who designed and made it. You're amazing!
Paimon: Yeah, that is amazing! And it sounds like Idyia did a great job, too!
Idyia: It was nothing, really. Just one of those "Oh no, whatever shall I wear to the ball" moments... Sewing comes in handy at times like that.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Sewing is an art in its own right. You're more talented than you give yourself credit for, Idyia.
Idyia: Really? Oh, uh... I—I'm just gonna go for a second... please, chat amongst yourselves...
Paimon: She gets embarrassed so easily... She really can't handle being in the spotlight.
Zosimos: Idyia's a sensitive person, and doesn't have a whole lot of self-confidence... I hope all the excitement hasn't brought her to tears? Hmm, I'm a little worried...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Don't worry, I'll go make sure she's okay. I'll see you all later.
Zosimos: So, what did you all think of the play? Any thoughts?
Paimon: Huh? Uh-oh, time to get serious! Now, are you sure you want to hear what we really think?
Zosimos: Oh, absolutely! I had the courage to ask, didn't I? So don't mince your words. Go ahead, speak your mind. I can take it!
Traveler: Okay, since he's asking for it...
Paimon: Okay, Paimon will go first! So the dialogue at the beginning was pretty good, but it ran out of steam as the story went on, Paimon could tell that you ran out of inspiration somewhere along the way.
Paimon: The characters were honestly a little bit ridiculous. Paimon didn't get what you were trying to do — the moment anyone started to show any kind of substance, suddenly the scene was over!
Idyia: Yes, all very good points, Paimon. I would add that in its attempt to pay tribute to the series "A Thousand Nights," all semblance of a coherent was sacrificed. Plus, I do have to penalize you for the issues with the props.
Klee: Miss Idyia? What are you doing back here?
Idyia: Oh, you know... I return like the tide when people start discussing something important!
Zosimos: Especially when it has to do with criticizing my show!
Idyia: Mm-hmm! But there was one thing I liked about it... just one, mind you. The story had a good ending.
Traveler: Idyia's even harsher than Paimon.
Idyia: ...You think so? I thought I was letting him off lightly.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Idyia, could I borrow you for a moment?
Idyia: Oh, sure! Excuse me for a moment. Back to you, Paimon! Keep up the good criticism.
Paimon: Okay! In that case, Paimon did have one other complaint.
Zosimos: Let's hear it! Taking criticism on the chin is all part of being a director.
Paimon: The ending was all wrong. The girl's motives were clear and simple the whole way through. It was kinda jarring when all she had to say was "I dunno."
Paimon: And doesn't anyone else find it weird how her whole community was on the run... but she was only looking out for herself the whole time?
Traveler: So even the "good ending" wasn't so good.
Zosimos: I'm fine. I'm not going to improve without feedback! I also learned a lot this time with the chance to be offstage. To be honest, it was a dream come true.
Paimon: What a great attitude! You don't seem upset at all by our comments.
Zosimos: I wouldn't say I'm completely unaffected, but you're only speaking the truth. They're all very valid points.
Paimon: Still, now that Paimon thinks about it, you did finish the script in a bit of a rush... Hmm, maybe we are being a little too hard on you.
Traveler: It was quite ambitious.
Zosimos: Haha, that's perfectly fine. Nothing is as important to me as my work on the stage.
Zosimos: We all use our imaginations when we're kids, right? I used to play with dolls and my own cardboard cutouts by the light of an oil lamp. The shadows would come to life and dance on the walls... I never got tired of it.
Zosimos: Fast forward to now, and in many ways I'm still that same little kid, lying on his bed making sound effects. And I get the same joy from running a show now as I did in my little bedroom theater.
Zosimos: ...Of course, a director can accomplish nothing without a cast and crew, so on that note, I want you all to know that I am eternally grateful to each and every one of you.
Paimon: Hey, don't mention it! We had a blast!
Zosimos: Hahaha... Okay here, take this. Your component, as promised.
Klee: It's the bottle from the show! The one that lit up when I blew into it!
Zosimos: That's right. Can you guess the secret behind why it lights up?
Klee: Ummm... Oh, maybe there's an invisible fairy inside that opens its eyes when you blow into it!
Zosimos: ...
Zosimos: Bingo! You guessed it.
Idyia: That should do the trick? Oh wait, this needs tightening up a little... Hold on, this will only take a second.
Traveler: (Hmm? Something interesting's going on over there...)
Kaeya: This outfit's more fashionable than I imagined...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Excuse me, everyone, do you have a moment? Especially you, Zosimos. Idyia wants to do a little something for you — she says it'll be a dream come true.
Zosimos: A dream come true?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Yes. She said that as useless as she is, she wants to do something for you as the first person to have heard of your dream of being a director.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Her words, not mine. I have to disagree though — I have never thought of Idyia as a useless person.
Idyia: How is this suddenly about me...
Idyia: If everybody is ready... then I'd like to invite tonight's male lead to take the stage! Ta-daa!
Paimon: Wooooow!
Klee: Cool! Kaeya's turned into the real dagger bandit!
Kaeya: Um, how is me changing outfits supposed to make the director's day? It's just a prototype costume... Is he that easy to please?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Don't be silly! If I know our director, nothing will make him happier than to see his ideas brought to life by the right actor.
Kaeya: Hahaha... Well, then I'm happy to oblige. Who am I to argue with the star of the show?
Idyia: Zosimos drew up countless designs and made a few prototypes before landing on this one. It just needed some tailoring to fit properly, so I made a few stitches here and there... I hope the result isn't a disappointment?
Zosimos: ...It's perfect, Idyia, I... I'm...
Zosimos: I'm... *sobs* I'm so touched... Thank you all, you've made me happier than I ever thought I could be...
Black Screen Text: After seeing his performance for the first time, Zosimos cries tears of joy for a dream come true.
Kaeya: How're you doing? Recovered?
Zosimos: I'm good. Thank you again, Idyia.
Idyia: Oh please... Don't mention it. Well, now that we have the final component, it's time to say goodbye for now. Let's head to the core of the Veluriyam Mirage and get this place fixed up.
Klee: Can I keep wearing my costume?
Zosimos: Please do, by all means. Both of you can keep your costumes, it seems only fair.
Klee: Yay! Kaeya, keep wearing yours too, it looks amazing!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I agree with our mage. I'm sure it's not every day you get to play such an unforgettable character.
Kaeya: Sure. I think I can be a bandit for a little longer.
Klee: Bye-bye, Mr. Director!
Zosimos: Take care, my dear friends!
Traveler: You okay, Zosimos?
Traveler: It really suits you!
