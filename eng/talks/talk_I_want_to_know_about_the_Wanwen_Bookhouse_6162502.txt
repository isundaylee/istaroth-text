Traveler: I want to know about the Wanwen Bookhouse.
Jifang: Strange, most people who come here are looking for books, not the bookhouse itself...
Jifang: Anyway, my husband is the one with a bit of a thing for collecting old books. But he doesn't earn any money...
Jifang: That's why I opened this place. Got to make a living somehow.
