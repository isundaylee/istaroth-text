# Smoldering Phosphorescent Flame

Specialized refinement material for "Tamayuratei no Ohanashi."
Embers of phosphorescent fire scattered by a youkai who once donned the form of flame, traveling the length and breadth of Inazuma. Just as each and every oil lamp remembers the words of those who once gathered beneath its glow, there may well be memories retained within these dispersed embers that are of great import to some.
