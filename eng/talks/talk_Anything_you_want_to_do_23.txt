# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Dehya: You mean here? Uh, I can't think of anything in particular...
Dehya: If I had to pick something, I guess I'd like to explore this place thoroughly.
Dehya: I mean, this is my first time inside a teapot. I doubt anyone would believe me if I told them.
Traveler: What do you usually do in your spare time?
Dehya: Maintain my weapons, check my next job, sneak in a quick nap.
Dehya: If there's still time to burn, I'll grab a few drinks at the city tavern, but I usually don't have that much free time.
Traveler: Being a merc isn't easy...
Dehya: That's life for ya. Everyone's stressed out one way or another, and there's no escaping it.
Dehya: Even more so for mercs â€” we're looking for our next job before we even finish our current one.
Dehya: With so many competitors in this line of work, laziness will only net you an empty stomach.
Dehya: Hahaha, okay, enough serious talk. Days off are few and far between, so it'd be a waste not to unwind while I still can.
Dehya: Hmm... Why don't you show me around and introduce me to the others here?
Dehya: Especially that little bird named Tubby. Looks like she has her own teapot, what's up with that?
Traveler: You're overworking yourself...
