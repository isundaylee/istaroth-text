Kuki Shinobu: #What are you up to, Traveler?
Kuki Shinobu: For once, I have the day off. I'm gonna make the most of it.

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Kuki Shinobu: It's pretty nice. Thanks for the invite.
Kuki Shinobu: I just did a few laps of the place. The general layout's really quite interesting. Did you study landscape design?
Traveler: No, I just went with my gut.
Kuki Shinobu: Ah, so you're one of those naturally gifted types. A self-taught prodigy.
Kuki Shinobu: This has piqued my interest, though... I wonder if I should study for a qualification in landscape design?
Traveler: Why not? Go for it!
Kuki Shinobu: Wow, I like the enthusiasm, haha. Thanks for the support.
Kuki Shinobu: I guess I'll give it a shot, then. But could you possibly let me borrow this site before the exam, for me to practice on?
Kuki Shinobu: In return, let's see... I'll cover all your roasted Lavender Melon costs leading up to the exam. What do you think?
Traveler: I know a thing or two. You've studied it, too?
Kuki Shinobu: Actually, no, I haven't...

## Talk

Traveler: Do you want to chat?
Kuki Shinobu: Sure, I'm not exactly busy right now. If you've got any questions, ask away!
Traveler: What is it that you don't like about shrine maidens?
Kuki Shinobu: I think you may have misunderstood me...
Kuki Shinobu: I have nothing against any shrine maiden. It's not even that I detest the profession. Believe me, I know every job comes with its challenges...
Kuki Shinobu: The simple fact is that being a shrine maiden is just not for me. The reasons are complicated... let me think how to explain it...
Traveler: Is it to do with your family?
Kuki Shinobu: Hmm... You're gonna think this sounds childish, but yes, you're right. Sometimes, I just can't stand my family...
Kuki Shinobu: I know they only wanted the best for me, but trying to achieve that by planning out every aspect of my life for me just made everything unbearable.
Kuki Shinobu: They always treated me like I was a child, felt like they had to constantly nag me to make sure I didn't slip up. Every time I received a letter of complaint saying that I wasn't warm and friendly enough, they would be on my case about it for days.
Kuki Shinobu: I just don't like to smile, that's all. Doesn't mean I have any animosity towards anyone.
Traveler: That's understandable.
Kuki Shinobu: In a nutshell, I prefer to work jobs where the metrics are clear and where I can see the actual results of my efforts.
Kuki Shinobu: Jobs like that come naturally to me, and they give me a chance to show my family that my choices aren't worse than theirs just because they're different.
Kuki Shinobu: But the most important thing is that I no longer have to force myself to do something I don't want to do. I can live a pretty free life.
Traveler: Is it to do with you?
Kuki Shinobu: Yeah, I guess it must be.
Kuki Shinobu: Look, a lot of people just want a fortune slip hoping to get a bit of good luck, and they don't really care what's written on the slip.
Kuki Shinobu: But then there are those who, for all sorts of reasons, end up in dire straits and turn to prayer as their last resort...
Kuki Shinobu: They desperately want some divine power to make all of their problems go away.
Kuki Shinobu: It doesn't sit right with me. I can't bring myself to say "things'll get better" to people like that. It's just a cop-out.

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Kuki Shinobu: Actually, there's something I'd like your help with, and it has to be you.
Kuki Shinobu: I'm working on a "Migrant Housing Scheme"...
Kuki Shinobu: I know the different policies for migrant workers purchasing real estate in the different nations. But I don't know much about the local cultures...
Kuki Shinobu: What kind of things do people living in different areas need be aware of? What are the local gangs, who are the local powerplayers?
Kuki Shinobu: You've been to a lot of places. Could you give me some pointers?
Traveler: Hold on, are we...
Kuki Shinobu: What!? No! This has nothing to do with the Arataki Gang.
Kuki Shinobu: I'm just helping a client with their "Migration Prospectus," and I'm gonna take the opportunity to go traveling for a few days.
Kuki Shinobu: I'm working on something else for the other guys... the "Arataki Gang's Comprehensive Guide to Surviving and Thriving." It's progressing nicely...
Kuki Shinobu: You know what those numbskulls are like. They aren't mean-spirited, but they do cause no end of trouble.
Kuki Shinobu: I can't be around them all the time. In the long term, something's gotta change.
Traveler: You're not going to leave the gang, are you?
Kuki Shinobu: Of course not, at least not for now. As the de-facto manager, I still can't say I've turned the gang into something I'm proud of, and I am not gonna quit halfway.
Kuki Shinobu: Who knows what the future holds, though.
Kuki Shinobu: If it really gets to the point where we end up parting ways, well, sometimes that's just how life goes...
Kuki Shinobu: Everyone who's trying to make their life work deserves to be happy, regardless of what direction they've chosen.
Kuki Shinobu: Same goes for the Arataki Gang and I as for you and me. No matter where the future takes us, whether we stay together or part ways, we'll always have each other's support, won't we?
Traveler: I'll support you whatever you do!
Kuki Shinobu: If you say so, I'll hold you to it. Oral agreements are just as binding as written agreements, you know.
Kuki Shinobu: So... if I do end up leaving the Arataki Gang and come looking to you for protection, you can't say no, okay? Uh... Tubby can be my witness.
Kuki Shinobu: Hehe, but for better or worse, it's probably not gonna happen. I don't like to rely on anyone, it doesn't suit my personality.
Traveler: Are you planning the Arataki Gang's escape?

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Shinobu!
Kuki Shinobu: #Morning, Traveler. Any plans for the day? Gimme a shout if you need any help.
Kuki Shinobu: When you're a freelancer like me, you get to be pretty flexible with your schedule. I can always make time where necessary.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Shinobu.
Kuki Shinobu: #Alright, Traveler, go get some rest.
Kuki Shinobu: I took an editing job recently, and I'm working on a manuscript right now. It's interesting, but it's gonna keep me busy for a while.
Kuki Shinobu: ...Don't be like me. Having a consistent routine is vital, so go get to bed.

## Talk

Kuki Shinobu: Wow, there are more books here than I expected, and a wide range of genres, too...
Kuki Shinobu: Hmm? Wow, you even have reference books. Just from flipping through, they look pretty interesting...
Kuki Shinobu: You know... I feel right at home here. Actually, I think I might settle in for the long haul, if it's alright with you.

## Talk

Kuki Shinobu: I took a part-time job selling toys once. Barely managed to sell anything, and I got tons of complaints from the parents...
Kuki Shinobu: Allegedly, my face mask and generally mean-looking demeanor was frightening the kids... It's funny, because I distinctly remember hearing the kids say how cool I looked as they walked by.
Kuki Shinobu: Whatever. It's in the past now, anyway.
