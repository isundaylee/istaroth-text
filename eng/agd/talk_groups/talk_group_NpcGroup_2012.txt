## Talk

Nervous An: You gave Linling the manifest, I trust? Has she headed off to work yet?
Nervous An: I won't hide it from you. Each piece of cargo on that manifest was one that I picked out specially.
Nervous An: As for their numbers and other details, I have had them in hand for a while now, as well.
Nervous An: Like I said, this is a test, not an actual job.
Nervous An: I hope she takes this seriously and realigns her priorities. At least, then, those nights of midnight oil that I burned won't go to waste...

## Talk

Nervous An: It never rains, but it pours...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Nervous An: After that huge incident at the Rite of Descension, the streets have been filling up with Millelith.
Nervous An: The tension in the air hangs over us like a shroud. Our doors aren't closed, but...
Nervous An: You know as well as I do how Liyue often does business with other nations, and how many people from every nation live in our city.
Nervous An: They've brought us prosperity, and a fair amount of cultural exchange, too.
Nervous An: But this incident has caused many such people to be very ill at ease.
Nervous An: I've been making preparations to try and calm people down, but with the situation as it is, I don't know where to begin looking for people good at international relations.
Nervous An: Hmm, wait a moment. Traveler, you've been to many different parts of the world already, haven't you? You must be good at speaking to people from other nations.
Nervous An: Could I trouble you, then, to help me calm some of our guests down?

## Talk

Traveler: I'll see this done.
Nervous An: Thank you, you're a big help. Now, I need to go and settle some other matters.

## Talk

Traveler: I'll give this a try...
Nervous An: Well, then... please do. I really have no one else to turn to.

## Talk

Nervous An: Please retain a copy of your approved mooring license application form for your records... Hey! What are you doing!

## Talk

Traveler: What are you up to?
Nervous An: I'm working, can't you see? I deal with all vessels entering and exiting the harbor, including mooring and customs procedures.
Nervous An: Please don't disturb me if you have no business here. The restricted goods approval form... Needs to be signed by a Millelith Sergeant...
Traveler: Didn't know talking to yourself counts as working.
Nervous An: ...Can you stop annoying me? I'm working out what I need to do next.
Nervous An: ...Aiya, now I've lost my train of thought...

## Talk

Traveler: I'll leave you to it. Bye.
Nervous An: *grunts*
Nervous An: Ah yes... And the potable water replenishment forms for all vessels need to be processed at the warehouse...

## Talk

Nervous An: Hi there! May the flames of wisdom spread to all, and never be extinguished!
Nervous An: This is the Lantern Rite Gala. I'm from the Maritime Authority, is there something I can help you with?

## Talk

Traveler: What can you tell me about Lantern Rite?
Nervous An: Lantern Rite is an annual festival everyone in Liyue celebrates. It takes place during the first full moon of the year.
Nervous An: During the five-day festival, people pray for peace, ward off evil spirits, and watch the lanterns. We believe the fire's light keeps wisdom alive, and guides fallen heroes home along the sea.
Nervous An: It's a popular tradition to make Xiao Lanterns and release them into the night sky.
Nervous An: The lanterns light the path for the souls of our fallen heroes as they travel by cover of night. We hope the lanterns will guide them back home so they can be reunited with us here.
Nervous An: Of course, I enjoy the time off work the most! Haha, I hope you thoroughly enjoy yourselves and participate in all the festivities on offer.

## Talk

Traveler: What are Xiao Lanterns?
Nervous An: Good question. As you might have guessed, you can't have a Lantern Rite without lanterns!
Nervous An: Usually home-made, they consist of a paper frame with a wick inside. After lighting the wick, Plaustrite is inserted to make it float.
Nervous An: Before releasing it into the air, people will write their wishes on wish sticks and insert them into the lantern. The lantern then carries their wishes off into the night sky.
Nervous An: Liyue may be well known for its mining industry, but fortunately, being surrounded by rocks hasn't turned people's hearts to stone...
Nervous An: Maybe it's because we also live off the sea. That romantic idea of the gentle sea breeze has found its way into our hearts... Haha.
Nervous An: Would you care to try making your own Xiao Lantern? After all, it's not every day you get to be in Liyue during Lantern Rite.

## Talk

Traveler: Not right now, thanks.
Nervous An: Okay. Well, enjoy your time here.
