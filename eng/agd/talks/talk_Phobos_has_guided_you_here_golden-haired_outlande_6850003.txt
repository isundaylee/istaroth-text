Nameless Stone Statue: Phobos has guided you here, golden-haired outlander.
Traveler: And you are...
Nameless Stone Statue: Lucius Patricius am I, a musician of our empire.
Nameless Stone Statue: Be not alarmed, outlander. Unlike my kin who have been inundated by their dreams, I still maintain the tranquility of my melody.
Traveler: What is this place?
Nameless Stone Statue: This was, once upon a time, Portus Anticus. The most prosperous port in the empire. Today, it is our sepulcher.
Nameless Stone Statue: If you seek the bronze bell that once dispersed the boundless ocean fog, then continue upward. Mayhap time and rust have not utterly devoured her.
Traveler: You seem pretty calm about all this...
Nameless Stone Statue: The fall of the empire, the death of our God King... All these things were predestined. Getting emotional about events long-fated is unwise.
Nameless Stone Statue: Why should one agonize over a matter that is merely a part of life? In truth, every moment in life is worthy of our tears.
Nameless Stone Statue: Moreover, of what benefit is sorrow and resentment, if punishment cannot wipe away sin?
Traveler: See you.
Nameless Stone Statue: Farewell, golden-haired outlander. May your music be tranquil.
