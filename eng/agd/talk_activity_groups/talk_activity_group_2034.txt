# Talk Activity Group: 2034

## Talk

Dori: This commission is tricky, and I'm practically losing Mora. Just remember that I'm doing you a huge favor here!

## Talk

Layla: So, she wants to summarize the effects of stars interacting with each other... That's going to be tricky.
Traveler: Happy Sabzeruz Festival, "other Layla."
Layla: Ah, you noticed... As you can see, daylight Layla is currently too stressed to enjoy the festivities.
Layla: With a deadline coinciding with the festival, and a research topic concerning complex astrology... It's no surprise she's been sleepwalking again.
Traveler: Is there anything I can do to help?
Layla: Sorry. I'm not sure we can trust such complex and precise calculations to someone else. Just visit her more often, if you have the time. I think that would make her very happy.
Traveler: Happy Sabzeruz Festival, "Blessing from the stars."

## Talk

#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Oh? Now this is a first. Who goes to the Akademiya in the middle of a festival?
Traveler: You're here, aren't you?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: This is the only place where I can escape all the commotion.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Go have your fun, and don't tell anyone you saw me here.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: These festivals don't come by often, so you might as well let me enjoy it in my own way.
Traveler: You're not going to join in on the fun?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Do I strike you as someone who wants to hold hands and dance with everyone?

## Talk

Najia: Nilou! Wanna go grab dessert after rehearsal? Puspa Café just released a limited-time special for the Sabzeruz Festival!
Nilou: Oh, um... I—I'd better not. It's almost Parade day, so I should restrain myself.
Najia: Shame... I heard they're doing a buy one get one free promotion for their Padisarah Pudding!
Nilou: Really?
Najia: Oh, and their tahchin is buy one get one half off...
Nilou: Wow...
Najia: And there was something special about the syrup for the Baklava, too...
Nilou: Ahh...! N—No more! Please! How about I just come with you...

## Talk

Reza: Hello. I'm the Port Master of Port Ormos. Come see me or my chief secretary for any questions regarding trade.
Reza: The Dendro Archon's birthday sure has brought in whole fleets of new ships from abroad! Sure, we're really happy trade is flourishing, but it's also fertile ground for new problems to crop up...
Reza: *sigh* I shouldn't jinx things like that. After all, nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?
Reza: Speaking with the foreign merchants is most interesting, too. I've learned quite a lot.

## Talk

Feroz: Oho, and where might this little beetle have crawled out from? Are you here to celebrate Lesser Lord Kusanali's birthday?
Feroz: Then a word of advice: If you see little Ajilenakh Nuts running about on the road, best to take a detour!
Feroz: Those snot-nosed little brats don't watch where they're going at all, and their fingers are all coated with sticky candy...
Feroz: Don't ask me how I know!

## Talk

Araby: Hello there. Sumeru sure is lively lately, isn't it?
Araby: Though I'd love to just calmly observe the sea, the sounds of merriment and celebration sometimes drown out the waves.
Araby: But now we must be more vigilant. What if some giant sea monster wants to come celebrate the Dendro Archon's birthday too, but accidentally knocks the lighthouse over?
Araby: I've got to be ready to remind it to watch its step, haha!
Araby: ...Um, don't take it seriously! I'm just joking!

## Talk

Nesmil: On a festival suffused with the fragrance of flowers such as this, everyone wants to enjoy sweet drinks!
Nesmil: How about you, dear customers? Would you like to try some of our newest sweet wines?

## Talk

Roshana: Are you here to take a picture with the Flower Carriage? Please, go ahead.
Roshana: No, the Flower Carriage has nothing to do with our shop. However, the end of its route is nearby, so it's being kept here temporarily for everyone to admire.
Roshana: A lot of first-time tourists keep coming to ask about it since they think our tavern set it up.
Roshana: Hmm... Maybe I should send Nesmil over there to drum up business...

## Talk

Shapur: Sisi, get back here! You're interfering with the Parade!
Shapur: Huh? You mean that there's no Flower Carriage or cats named Sisi here?
Shapur: Don't... Don't you lie to me just because I'm old! I clearly saw... Uh, when was that again?

## Talk

Berbere: Friend, have you heard the legend of the Dance of Sabzeruz? Would you like to feel the breath of the Goddess of Flowers?
Berbere: If you think that the Goddess of Flowers can bring only the fragrance of Padisarah, then you're practically blind. The spices of Sumeru are hardly so one-note!
Berbere: Such complex and mysterious scents can only be felt here!

## Talk

Elham: Hello! Um... May I ask you a question?
Elham: Do you still have those special candies? You know, the ones scattered on the candy towers.
Elham: My friend got some for me, and of course, the candies taste great, but I'm really curious what the coating is made out of.
Elham: It feels so soft, but it also isn't easily damaged by distributed pressure. I was just thinking, maybe it could be used for clothing?

## Talk

Nika: Sabzeruz Festival, Sabzeruz Festival!
Zai: Sabzeruz Festival, Sabzeruz Festival!
Nika: Where should we go today? Want to dress up the Sumpter Beasts for the festivities together?
Zai: Woohoo! Is it a Sabzeruz tradition for people who keep Sumpter Beasts?
Nika: Eh? I, uh... I don't remember Dad ever doing it...
Nika: But don't you think it really adds to the festive mood?
Nika: The Dendro Archon will bless the trees with delicious apples, making the Sumpter Beasts happy too!
Zai: Oooh, that's right! If Sumpter Beasts are all dressed up and looking their best, and enjoy their food, they'll probably be tastier too!
Nika: ?

## Talk

Fariba: Welcome, welcome...
Fariba: Please, look around and buy anything that catches your eye. What you see is what we've got.
Fariba: As for Sabzeruz Festival souvenirs, or model Flower Carriages, we are currently out of stock.
Fariba: In response to customer requests, the caravan manager has informed me that they are making more. Please be patient, thank you.
Fariba: ...Though from what I know of them, by the time they finish, like as not the festival will already be over...

## Talk

Siger: Hey, can I make a wish to Lesser Lord Kusanali for some more valuable books to add to my collection?
Siger: Ever since I lost that batch of literary treasures, my luck's been awful.
Siger: Every book that's even slightly valuable gets reserved by the Akademiya first. They even take all the worthless ones.
Siger: What's that you say? I should just get a job at the House of Daena? ...Actually, don't tell me... Let me think it over... Do they hire foreigners there?

## Talk

Housein: Everyone said that promotional events would bring in more customers. That's true enough.
Housein: But tricks like that are really only good for getting everyone into the holiday mood. Much better to just keep your prices stable and sell higher volumes with lower profit margins.
Housein: Dendro Archon, please bless our business going forward. Let our business be even more smooth and stable, let there be no setbacks...

## Talk

Nabiya: Sweetness is the most terrifying temptation. You must know how to enjoy happiness, yet not lose yourself in it.
Nabiya: It's like how eating too many Candied Ajilenakh Nuts can give you cavities. Too much sweetness is suffering.
Nabiya: See, even Harut and Marut understand this truth.
Nabiya: You definitely look like a most fortunate person, but they don't seem to be clinging to you, now do they?

## Talk

Fariha: Hello. I'm Mr. Nizam's secretary. I'm responsible for taking minutes for him.
Fariha: If you see Mr. Nizam sighing slightly more than usual, it's a normal occurrence.
Fariha: There's always more to do whenever there's an event being held in the city.
Fariha: We'll talk later. I still need to sort out which supplies need restocking.

## Talk

Avena: I think I'll go explore over there next!
Lemta: Miss, with all due respect, your adventure plan...
Avena: Oh, I know, I haven't forgotten! But isn't it the Sabzeruz Festival that's going on right now?
Avena: How could I not throw myself, body and soul, into such an important holiday?
Lemta: Your whole body and soul and one thing, but if you throw your whole wallet at the festival too, you won't have anything left to cover adventuring expenses, you know!
Avena: Oh, wallet schmallet! That's where you're wrong. You can't eat money, it's meant to be spent!
Lemta: *sigh* Really? Well, alright, then...

## Talk

Farzaneh: Is this a dream...? Or am I seasick again... I should still be standing on dry land, right?
Farzaneh: This is truly... The most wondrous festival I have ever experienced.
Farzaneh: If I am to be so happy I get dizzy, I think I could get used to that kind of dizziness...

## Talk

Ashk: You can still hear the hustle and bustle of the market, even from this high up...
Ashk: Haha, seems like joy is just like Sabzeruz Festival candies — being cast in every direction!

## Talk

Azra: You saw it, right, you must've seen it! Nilou's Dance of Sabzeruz!
Azra: My word! Such an incredible performance, seeing it once isn't nearly enough... I hope to see her in my dreams every night...

## Talk

Rukh Shah: Hello. I'm the Parchamdar for the Corps of Thirty, in charge of the Eremites in Sumeru City.
Rukh Shah: Happy holidays, and hope you have fun! But please be careful too.
Rukh Shah: If you notice anything unusual, big or small, please inform the nearest member of the Corps of Thirty.

## Talk

Qushji: May the Dendro Archon watch over the stars during the Sabzeruz Festival, that no abnormal incidents should befall...
Qushji: And of course, please watch over my neck too...

## Talk

Armin: Sis, you've got to believe that Aranara are real now!
Arina: No. The Aranara we saw, was only what the Dendro Archon willed us to see.
Arina: Sweet dreams are wonderful, but don't confuse them with reality. It's like dreaming about getting a perfect score on an exam. You still need to hit the books after you wake.
Armin: Sis, you're being scary again...
Arina: I only speak the truth, and I'll say it again. The teacher has already said it many times. Aranara do not exist.
Armin: But... what if... What if there's things even the teacher doesn't know...
Arina: Well... I'm not saying it's wrong to doubt your teacher, but I'm still not changing my mind about the Aranara.
Arina: If you want to believe in them, Armin, that's fine! After all, you're still young.

## Talk

Lila: *sobs* Grandma, please, since it's the Dendro Archon's birthday, can I not take my medicine...?
Tahmina: Oh, but the Dendro Archon wants you to be healthy, my little Lila! If you don't take your medicine, how will you get better?
Lila: But... But...
Lila: O—Okay then... Fine. But can I at least have some candy before I take it?
Tahmina: My dear Lila, if you have the medicine after the candy, then won't it be the bitter aftertaste that sticks around?
Tahmina: Even the scariest Eremites know that work comes before play. If you don't believe me... Perhaps I should ask them to teach you?
Lila: No, no! They're scary! I don't want that...

## Talk

Ramiz: Grandma, look, look! Sumeru City is just as lively as Setaria said!
Kulsoom: But of course! Don't run too fast, or I might not be able to keep up, you know.
Ramiz: Don't worry, I won't! There's so much to see here, I wanna take my time to take it all in.
Kulsoom: Hehe... He's every bit as serious about having fun as he is about studying.
Kulsoom: That's good, very good. Conscientious people are successful, no matter what they do.
Ramiz: Grandma, can I ask you for another favor? Could you take me to the Akademiya?
Kulsoom: Of course, of course! Still, it's uphill much of the way, so I might have to ask for your support too.
Ramiz: No problem! Thank you so much, Grandma!

## Talk

Ayten: Hmm... I've had candy, seen the flowers... Next...
Karima: Next? What's next on your list?
Ayten: Hehe... I wonder if there's any weaponsmiths around here? I want to buy a sword, the bigger the better!
Karima: Huh!? But... That's dangerous... And could you even lift it?
Ayten: If I can't, you're here to help, right? The two of us should be able to carry it back to Aaru Village!
Karima: Then... Then I also have something I want to buy! And you have to help me carry it, Ayten!
Ayten: Heh... Say no more. I already know exactly what you want.
Ayten: Don't worry. We'll pick you out a shield every bit as awesome-looking as Candace's.

## Talk

Durgar: Hello, and happy Sabzeruz! I apologize, but I'm taking the holidays off, so if you have any carpentry commissions, please wait until after the festival.
Durgar: Everything that grows in Sumeru is a gift from the Dendro Archon, so let's give the plants some time off during the Sabzeruz Festival too, haha!

## Talk

Tighnari: I should find someone to keep watch near Pardis Dhyai tomorrow...

## Talk

Candace: I hope the Dendro Archon didn't see through us just now... I wish we got the chance to ask her about the gem.

## Talk

Faruzan: Poor Kaveh, getting scolded by a senior like that... I should treat him to a nice meal next time.

## Talk

Kaveh: We were just acting, but now I can't stop thinking about all the changes I could make to the design... *sigh* Maybe I need a break from commissions...

## Talk

Layla: Wait... did I miss a variable? Don't tell me... I have to start from scratch...?
Traveler: Is everything okay, Layla?
Layla: Oh... yep! I'm fine, just kinda feels like I'm seeing stars...
Layla: Gotta get it together! I have to finish this paper before the Festival so I can watch the Parade...
Traveler: The Dendro Archon wouldn't want you to push yourself.
Layla: Yeah... you're right...
Layla: Even the tiniest stars possess their own light. Keep shining, and eventually there will be people who see it... I just need to pick myself up and use another method to run the numbers.
Traveler: The Dendro Archon can already tell how hard you work.

## Talk

Cyno: Ah, you must be Hat Guy. I've heard Sethos talk about you recently.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: And you must be the General Mahamatra. Don't tell me you're also in the habit of convincing people to go to festivals...
Cyno: No, just had to check something at the Akademiya and thought I would stop by.
Cyno: But... I am rather curious about you.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...
Cyno: Do you play Genius Invokation TCG?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: No.
Cyno: That's good.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Huh?
Cyno: Do you know what would happen if you did play?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: I don't play.
Cyno: You'd beat me three times in a row... a real "hat trick."
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...

## Talk

Sorush: You there, Leaf Hat. I have a question.
Arasaka: Arasaka... Leaf Hat?
Sorush: The Pari find it challenging enough to protect the Vourukasha Oasis. How have you managed to protect a domain as vast as the rainforest for hundreds of years?
Arasaka: You are not a Nara... You are a bird! Red and warm and small! Arasaka can make you something to eat!
Sorush: A... bird? No, I am a Pari. We live in the Vourukasha Oasis.
Arasaka: The Vourukasha Oasis? Like Vanarana... but for a bird?
Sorush: Vana... rana? Something tells me this conversation is going nowhere...
Arasaka: Little red bird is a good bird! Good birds can come to Vanarana. Arasaka will make you delicious food.
Arasaka: We can practice Ararakalari together, and find lots and lots of "tracer"!
Sorush: Ah... well... okay...
Sorush: (Have I been stuck at the Oasis for too long? It's like I can't understand the language of the outside world anymore... Whatever he said sounded impressive, though.)

## Talk

Sethos: You do know you were invited to the Akademiya party, right? You're really not gonna show your face?
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: Heh, I don't remember doing anything worth getting invited. It's just another noisy room of people... Not my scene.
Sethos: Look, I'm no scholar, but even I've heard about your work in historical criticism and modern political research.
Sethos: You provided the clues and inspiration for their big paper. That basically makes you their hero. Your contribution is half the reason they even have something to celebrate.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: You'd think someone from the "Temple of Silence" would know when to stop talking...
Sethos: Okay, okay, I can take a hint. I'm just letting you know, they're gonna drag you there one way or another.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...You told them where I was?
Sethos: Hah, believe it or not, I do know when to keep my mouth shut. But, since I know you pretty well, they did ask me to come find you.
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: ...
#{REALNAME[ID(1)|HOSTONLY(true)]}: For the love of... Fine. Show me the way.

## Talk

Layla: Everyone looks so happy... The experience is different from gazing at the starry sky, but still... what a sight to behold.
Traveler: Layla?
Layla: Ah, it's you. Layla got a burst of energy after talking with you. She managed to finish her paper before the Festival without sleepwalking even once. But, she crashed as soon as it was submitted.
Layla: I saw her write this in the acknowledgement section...
Layla: "Interactions between stars can lend immense strength to involved bodies, to the point where they can even alter preexisting orbits..."
Layla: "Real life mirrors astronomy in this way. You never know what miracles can be achieved when two people seem to resonate at the same frequency. This author speaks from personal experience."
Layla: As for me... I'll take a picture to capture this moment and put it on her desk.

## Talk

Layla: Everyone looks so happy... The experience is different from gazing at the starry sky, but still... what a sight to behold.
Traveler: Layla?
Layla: It's me. Layla just managed to submit her paper, so she's resting now.
Layla: It's a pity she missed this year's Parade. But, her work ethic is truly commendable.
Layla: I'll take a picture to capture this moment and put it on her desk.

## Talk

Candace: I hope the sand didn't get into your sleeves, Traveler. Here, have a seat.
Traveler: Are you busy?
Candace: No, I was just practicing an ancient melody. It's beautiful, but I don't know how it ends. That knowledge has been lost to the sands.
Candace: I used to play it over and over again, never able to fully complete it.
Candace: But tonight, I want to try to give it a suitable ending.
Candace: Perhaps it's just the festival spirit, but I can't help but feel like certain stories deserve a happy ending...
Candace: Certain memories remain just as precious, even as they fade with time...
Traveler: Back so soon?
Candace: Sounds like our Knight of Flowers hasn't had enough of the festivities.
Candace: But, Aaru Village is where I truly belong.
Candace: I had a wonderful time with everyone, but I don't mind returning to my daily life.
Candace: This is no time to be sad.
Candace: You see? Look at the sky... Another beautiful day is just around the corner.
Traveler: I've got something else to do right now...
Candace: In any case, even when the festivities end, that joy stays with us.

## Talk

Nahida: You're back! Here, let's share this Candied Ajilenakh Nut.
Traveler: Were you waiting for me?
Nahida: Hehe, now who's the mind reader?
Traveler: Did you have a happy birthday?
Nahida: Of course! It was amazing! It's like I was surrounded by everyone's kindness and warmth, like a little bird tucked away in a nest.
Nahida: I really can't thank everyone enough... the Aranara, the Pari, my dear friends.
Nahida: That said... You're still hiding something from me, aren't you?
Traveler: A—Am I...?
Nahida: Don't worry.
Nahida: If you think it should be kept a secret, then I trust your judgment.
Nahida: After all, you're my Knight of Flowers.
Traveler: Did you have a good time at the banquet?
Nahida: Of course! Every dish was such a pleasant surprise. I never knew what to expect... like trying to guess the flavor of Yalda Candies before opening the box!
Nahida: I wasn't really focused on the food, though. One look at everyone's happy faces, and I was already more than satisfied.
Nahida: After all, it's not the food that makes a banquet. It's the company!
Traveler: I should go...
Nahida: Okay! Who knows... Maybe the next time you see me, it'll be in one of your dreams, hehe!

## Talk

Masud: Dear traveler from afar, how has your Rocking Carriage experience been?
Traveler: Gotta give it another try first.
Masud: Fair enough. Rock to the rhythm of the carriage!
Traveler: I've got some suggestions...
Masud: Do tell, do tell. I'm listening.
Traveler: The carriage moves a little too slowly.
Masud: Ah, I see you're quite the speedrun enthusiast. Must be the sensory stimulation, eh?
Masud: That said, the Rocking Carriage is intended for the general public's enjoyment. I suspect that many children, ladies, and older folks might lack your alacrity.
Masud: I could try developing, say, a "Great Eremite Labyrinth Escape" for you, featuring greatly accelerated gameplay.
Masud: I'm sure that will not fail to satisfy!
Traveler: We weren't challenged enough.
Masud: I see. So you're the sort who prefers a challenge, then. The harder the challenge, the more you enjoy overcoming it.
Masud: I should say that the Rocking Carriage is a leisurely festive game, and many tourists prefer a simple, relaxing time.
Masud: After all, most people don't spend much time studying a game they just encountered. Making things too complicated risks scaring potential players off.
Masud: But what I could do for you is try developing a "Forest Ranger's Great Fungus Adventure" with additional obstacles of all sorts, even some moving puzzles.
Masud: I'm sure that will satisfy your desires.
Traveler: There was no combat during the drive.
Masud: Ah, so you're the type who prefers to overcome mighty foes in your adventures.
Masud: Alas, if we incorporated combat elements into the game, the focus would shift from driving the Flower Carriage to the larger experience of shooting from a moving vehicle.
Masud: Some prefer that simple driving experience, others prefer vehicle combat. Both understandable positions!
Masud: I could attempt to design, say, "The General Mahamatra's Swift Pursuit," which will focus on running battles and intercepting foes.
Masud: I'm sure that will better meet your expectations.
Traveler: "Phantom Toy Master" is quite the title.
Masud: Really? Thank you for the compliment. I'm quite fond of it myself — inherited it from my grandmother, in fact.
Masud: Whenever I hear that name, it reminds me of my childhood goal... To make toys that make everyone happy.
Masud: Ah, just thinking about it fills these old bones with boundless vitality.
Traveler: Your grandmother, you say?
Masud: Yes. A long, long time ago, Granny visited a mysterious Domain by accident, where she made some strange friends, and gained a nearly boundless font of inspiration.
Masud: Upon returning to Sumeru, she began to develop all manner of unique toys.
Masud: Shame, though, that she was ever focused on making the most extravagant, complex game modes. She rarely considered if children could take it all in, or paid much attention to market conditions.
Masud: My objective assessment is that her work only received recognition from a limited number of customers, and despite her good reputation, her works weren't able to bring that simple happiness to large audiences at the time.
Traveler: "Take it all in," you say?
Masud: Simply put, children of all ages buy toys, and they all learn at different speeds, so you can't generalize about their ability to get up to speed on something new.
Masud: Some toys are too complex, and some games have too many rules. Even teens might struggle to memorize everything in a short time — and children would struggle all the more.
Masud: Granny was far too enthusiastic about her work and neglected this, which negatively impacted her sales.
Masud: I wouldn't say it was her fault, or that of the children. They just weren't really well-suited for one another.
Masud: Had Granny switched to targeting her toys at the adult market, I imagine things would have gone differently.
Traveler: So, what were those market conditions?
Masud: Ah, and isn't that a complex question? To be honest, I've read many fine texts from many a scholar, but I still don't know how to evaluate it...
Masud: Simply put, more exquisite and ingenious toys require more investment, which will increase the price... Just as clockwork toys cannot be sold for the same price as origami models.
Masud: But neither Granny nor I figured out how much the price should be raised. How much Mora does everyone have in their purses? How much are they willing to pay for toys? That's something that only they know.
Masud: Customers' feelings are also key. If they're interested in one of your toys, some of them will be willing to spend a bit more. But if you don't catch their eye, they'll wait to get it on sale. There's no objective standard.
Masud: Granny made that error, and though she tried to lower her prices as much as possible, she still ended up running into the wall many times as a result. As such, I intend to do my best to strike a balance between quality, production costs, and price.
Masud: All in all, I've been quite happy these last few decades, and I have her to thank for it. She designed and bought more toys than I could ever finish playing with.
Masud: When she was still with us, we'd play with them together whenever she could find the time...
Masud: Ahem, right, enough dwelling on the past... Anyway, I will do my best to spread this joy to as many people as possible!
Traveler: We can talk later. I've got other things to do right now...
Masud: No issue. The joys of toys await you anytime!

Dharmakirti: Thanks for your assistance. This clinical trial is of great importance, so let me know once you're ready.
Traveler: I'm ready.
Traveler: I'm not quite ready yet.
Dharmakirti: No worries. We'll only start once you're good to go.
Dharmakirti: Once both you and the patient have awoken from the dream, we will continue to follow up with the patient over the long term. If the therapy produces good results, we should be able to detect long-lasting positive effects.

Collingwood: Sober up? Not gonna happen. Drinking too much may hurt my liver, but drinking too little wounds my heart.
Collingwood: Ha, it's a toughie, but not drinking just ain't an option.

Youguang: I've never been this frightened of doing guard work in my life. It's not like I want to tremble like this, but my legs just won't listen.
Youguang: Oh please, Lord of Geo, save me! Please!

## Talk

Higuchi Tetsuya: I must do whatever it takes to finish "Tales of One Hundred Youkai." I promised my readers I would — on my dignity as a youkai novel writer, no less!
Higuchi Tetsuya: But I've told tales about tengu, and I've talked of bake-danuki... How the heck will I get to one hundred different types!? Youkai are what I need, and fresh ones, new ones!

## Talk

Nitesh: This lab's so messy. If only I had an assistant to help me... *sigh* and it's not like I'm getting any younger...
Nitesh: Should I just retire back to Sumeru in two years or something? I mean, I can't stay here, can I?

Piyush: Everything must be arranged in some order. That's just one of my principles of design.
Piyush: All inhuman, asymmetrical architectural designs must be destroyed! Destroyed. With. Prejudice!

## Talk

Vihar: Honorable Knight of Flowers, is there any way we might be of service?
Safi: All you need to do for each fight scene is follow the basic theme of each scene. As the actual moves will be undertaken by a professional such as yourself, you needn't follow our original ideas.
Traveler: Then I'll be happy to shoot some more.
Safi: Haha! Please, feel free to show off your incredible talent to its fullest! The cameras hidden around the venue will capture your majestic, valiant form!
Safi: Our set design draws inspiration from the dangerous Domains in adventurer legends. Who knows, it might even inspire you in combat!
Traveler: Have I met you before, Vihar?
Vihar: I am truly honored that you still remember me.
Vihar: In Sabzeruz Festivals past, I played a Carriage-less Knight of Flowers a few times, mostly handing out candies to the children.
Vihar: Now, there's an eminently more suitable Knight of Flowers, and so I can play the role for which I am naturally suited, that of the Knight of Candies.
Safi: I think it works out quite well. Kids really like the title, and the image of you passing out candy year after year has made a deep impression on everyone.
Vihar: Then after the movie premieres, can I get a title like... the "Knight of Cinema" or something?
Safi: You will be credited as the Director, and I as the Producer. It will be hard to say which of us will be the "Knight of Cinema."
Traveler: About the filming progress...
Vihar: As you can see, we've only just begun.
Vihar: As the thematic focus of the film is "battle," we have decided to film those scenes first, and then, based on what we can realistically achieve, decide on how we wish to express ourselves through the shots, lighting, color palette, style, and other elements...
Vihar: Then, we'll use these to determine the details of the script, so that we can avoid... "that can't be done" and "we can't make the shot work" as much as possible.
Safi: That's why we'll wait for the fight scenes to be filmed, edited, and post-processed before we film the rest. It will likely take quite some time.
Traveler: Now that's a clever approach!
Safi: Not at all, it's just a trick I learned during my last study trip to Fontaine. We still have a lot of room for improvement!
Traveler: Now that's a very conservative approach!
Traveler: See you next time, then!
