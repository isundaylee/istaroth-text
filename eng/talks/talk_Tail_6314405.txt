Traveler: Tail?
Koyama: Ah? Uh, well, that was some time ago.
Koyama: Someone from the Tenryou Commission came here, but instead of looking for Her Excellency or General Gorou, he went walking around the island instead.
Koyama: Her Excellency couldn't figure out what he wanted, so she sent a few of us to follow him, in case he tried anything untoward.
Koyama: Turns out that he didn't really do any investigating at all. He just happened to be on a stroll in his uniform.
Koyama: He even called himself a detective or something. Are all detectives as weird as him?
