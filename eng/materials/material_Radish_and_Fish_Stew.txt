# Radish and Fish Stew

A meat and vegetable dish. The de-skinned radishes have gone into the pot first to cook before large hunks of fish and seasonings are added in. The whole combination is then stewed on a low flame. The large servings of food — best served with rice — give everyone present a feeling of satisfaction.
