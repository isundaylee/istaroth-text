Traveler: About the Fonta sponsorship...
Roussimoff: I'm not a fan of Fonta, it's too sweet. Pure Water, on the other hand, is pretty decent. Too bad the supply's unreliable.
Roussimoff: That Heinry's a good kid, though. As you know, the majority of people here have hit rock bottom... literally or figuratively, haha.
Roussimoff: If you bring a little sweetness into people's lives at a time like that, they'll never forget it once they turn over a new leaf and get out of this place. Don't you think?
