Yiran: Manager Kuan! I want to buy a kite!
Manager Kuan: How many times do I have to tell you, just call me "Daddy." Now, if you study hard, Daddy will buy you one, alright?
Yiran: No! Aren't you the shift supervisor of the Blackcliff Forge, Manager Kuan? As the supervisor, it's up to you to set an example.
Manager Kuan: But Daddy has to work, and you have to study. These are two completely differ—
Yiran: Then let's talk about work! "Let our actions be recognized by hard work. Let our achievements be what speaks first." Isn't that right?
Manager Kuan: That's right, that's the Blackcliff Forge motto... How'd you remember that so clearly?
Yiran: So let's start from your actions. If you buy me the kite, Manager Kuan, then I will recognize your hard work!
Manager Kuan: How many times do I have to say it — I'm "Daddy"! And how did this suddenly become about me? It's like you're trapping me in...
Yiran: You're the one that started talking about work, aren't you?
Manager Kuan: *sigh* Alright, then. I'll buy you a kite. But from now on, you must call me "Daddy."
Yiran: Alright, "Daddy"! Now, Daddy! Do as you promised!
