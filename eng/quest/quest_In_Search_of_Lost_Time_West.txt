# In Search of Lost Time: West


## Talk 1

Paimon: Whoa! So strict! Paimon definitely doesn't want to work for that guy!
Paimon: Where do they get the nerve to talk about "a sense of collective honor"? Where's the honor in not even letting anyone eat?
Traveler: He's not completely wrong.
Traveler: What a baffling rule...
Paimon: Well, discipline is important, but... surely this is taking it too far?
Paimon: Right!? The more someone doesn't know how to get things done, the weirder they get about discipline and rules...
Paimon: Huh? Come to think of it, if we also cause a commotion, we can probably lure that platoon leader Shumilov down, right?
Paimon: #Then, we'd be able to get up there... {NICKNAME}, let's give it a try!

## Talk 2

Research Terminal: (There's a memo stuck next to the lever on the right side of the console. In neat and elegant handwriting, it reads, "Do NOT touch under any circumstances!")

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Traveler: Pull the lever.
Paimon: #Whoa! What are you doing, {NICKNAME}?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): You pull the lever without the slightest hesitation.
The entire tower then immediately trembles with a thunderous, ear-splitting rumble. It's as if the sky is crumbling and the earth is splitting...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_CONSEQUENT_NEED_CLICK_BLACK_SCREEN): Then... with a pop, the machine spits out a stack of paper tape right into your hands.
All is quiet once more.
Paimon: Is... Is that it?
Paimon: Hmm... Paimon doesn't have a clue what's on it, but it looks pretty important...
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, why don't we keep this paper tape for now? Who knows, it might come in handy later...

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: We probably shouldn't touch it...
Paimon: #R... Right. It does seem dangerous... {NICKNAME}, maybe we should take a step back...

### Additional Talk 3

Paimon: Huh? It's a console just like the one in that other tower from before...
Traveler: Pull the lever.
Black Screen Text: You pull the lever.
Just like before, the machine spits out a stack of paper tape after a moment of rumbling and shaking...
Paimon: Hmm, it's paper tape, just like before...
Paimon: Paimon still doesn't get it, but we should probably take this stuff with us in case we need it later.

### Additional Talk 4

Paimon: What do we have here... Right, looks like a lever with "Do NOT touch under any circumstances!" written next to it!
Traveler: Pull the lever.
Black Screen Text: You pull the lever.
After some rumbling and shaking, the machine spits out a stack of paper tape...
Paimon: Great! Now we have the monitoring data from the Crepes Suzette Station!
Paimon: #All that's left now is the Pate de Fruit Station. Let's go, {NICKNAME}!

### Additional Talk 5

Paimon: What do we have here... Right, looks like a lever with "Do NOT touch under any circumstances!" written next to it!
Traveler: Pull the lever.
Black Screen Text: You pull the lever.
After some rumbling and shaking, the machine spits out a stack of paper tape...
Paimon: Great! Now we have the monitoring data from both the Pate de Fruit and Crepes Suzette Stations!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, let's go back to Broglie now!
