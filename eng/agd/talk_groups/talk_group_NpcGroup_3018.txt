## Talk

Matsumoto: Yo, hey there!
Matsumoto: Are you here to ask me to rate your dishes? Don't you disappoint me again.

## Talk

Traveler: Who are you?
Matsumoto: I'm Matsumoto, the traveling food critic. Recently, I've found myself in a dilemma of having no dishes to try out.
Matsumoto: I have already finished going through every single restaurant on this street. Whether it's Uyuu Restaurant or Kiminami Restaurant, there is nothing new around here.
Matsumoto: With my years of experience as a food critic, I'd rate these joints as "mediocre."
Matsumoto: I have tasted every single bizarre gourmet dish there is, but I find that there is more authenticity in simple and plain things.
Matsumoto: If you asked me what the tastiest thing in this world is... I would say it must be the lemon drink with unlimited refill from Kiminami Restaurant.

## Talk

Traveler: A food critic?
Matsumoto: Yes, as an experienced food critic, I will definitely give every dish you serve the fairest of comments.
Matsumoto: So, what would you like me to try? Please bring it to me.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye...
Matsumoto: Goodbye. *sigh* Guess it's just lemon water for me again today.

## Talk

Traveler: Bring it to you...?
Matsumoto: Yes, that's right. What's the matter?
Matsumoto: You're asking me to taste the food, so obviously you should be the one who pays or makes it for me.
Matsumoto: It would be difficult to be objective if you asked me to pay for the food. The price of the dish would affect the result.
Matsumoto: Only through a trade with no exchange of money can there be a fair review.

## Talk

Traveler: What kind of dishes are you looking for?
Matsumoto: Simpler dishes do a better job at revealing the chef's true mastery over the culinary arts.
Matsumoto: For example, these Egg Rolls from the Kiminami Restaurant. The dish needs to be at least of this level for it to be worthy of my critique.
Matsumoto: If you can't make something of this level, then I suggest you give up, as you are only wasting my time.
