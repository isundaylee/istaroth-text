Traveler: A tengu mask, huh?
Sanden: Yep, I'm talking about the mask that the tengu usually wear. It's normally red and said to be a symbol of their identity. In ancient times, they used it to intimidate others, too.
Sanden: Madam Kujou Sara of the Tenryou Commission wears one such mask on her head.
Sanden: But tengu masks are normally carried on a tengu's person. One can only look at them from afar with no real opportunity to take a closer look...
Sanden: *sigh* What a shame... If I had the chance to study one up close, I should be able to learn a lot from it...
