Lawrence: I had no idea what to do when the incident had just happened. At least we can finally draw all this to a close.
Lawrence: Still, it's quite remarkable that we encountered such an event. Doesn't this mean that we, too, have witnessed history?
Lawrence: Well, if anyone asks me for a tale or legend in the future, I'm going to tell them the story of Dvalin.
