## Talk

Biram: All oracles have their omens and signs, but not all questions can be answered straight away... Hello there.

## Talk

Traveler: Hello.
Biram: Welcome to the land of the Masters of the Night-Wind. I am the tribal chief, Biram.
Biram: Most people who visit come with questions they'd like answered, but I tend to leave them stewing a while longer before they ask.
Biram: Exploring secrets and revealing fortunes leads to results of a sort, and these results are exactly what the relevant prophecies reveal.
Biram: As such, those apt to know secrets bear additional responsibility by nature.
Biram: Frankly speaking, people who keep secrets are more likely to be healthy and live longer. That's one of the universal laws of nature.

## Talk

Traveler: We meet again!
Biram: It's you â€” the one who can distinguish "colors."
Biram: A rainbow has seven colors, but those are still not enough to weave a woven scroll.
Biram: I suspect your tale will add more colors to history.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Biram: Goodbye. May your heart be free from doubt.

Traveler: Like the fire here?
Biram: Like the fire here, yes.
Biram: It does not burn to destroy, but to shine bright.
Biram: Watch the flames dance, and perhaps they'll spark new inspiration within you.
