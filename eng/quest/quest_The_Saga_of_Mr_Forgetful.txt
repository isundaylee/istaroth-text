# The Saga of Mr. Forgetful


## Talk 1

Roald: Ah, so you're still on this island as well. That's great.
Roald: How have you been lately? Any shocking discoveries? Let's hear them, shall we?
Traveler: Nothing earth-shaking, I'd say.
Roald: Ah, but that's normal. Don't sweat it, I'd say. Islands like this never lack for mysteries, and I have full confidence that you'll stumble upon something eventually.
Paimon: Actually, Paimon's got a question. What are you doing here, Roald?
Roald: Me? Oh, I was just packing my things up and preparing to leave.
Roald: The fog here is too bizarre. Step into it for a bit, and you lose your way... And before you know it, you're right back where you started.
Roald: I'd forgotten the path that Kama pointed out to me before, so I tried looking for some natives to show me the way, but I couldn't find any path no matter how I tried...
Roald: My compass, the shadows on the ground... None of these help in telling directions here... I've even tried using my shoes, but nope! I couldn't take a single step further into the fog.
Paimon: Your... shoes?
Traveler: He means that he used them as waymarkers.
Paimon: What...!?
Roald: #Haha! As expected of you, Traveler! You're well-versed in adventuring tricks, indeed! You've got much to learn, Paimon!
Traveler: Yes, much to learn you have, Paimon.
Paimon: Oh, come on, that's just called trying your luck! Paimon doesn't have to learn that!
Roald: Either way, my progress has ground to a halt.
Roald: *sigh* If I had tied a rope to a nearby tree and tried to advance while holding on to its other end tightly, I could probably have made a few more attempts.
Paimon: So why didn't you try again?
Roald: I used up the backup shoes that I brought along to help tell which way I was going...
Traveler: So they were one-and-donesies, huh...
Roald: Well, they shouldn't have been, but I, uh... I threw too many of them and kept forgetting to retrieve them, so... I ran out over time, you know?
Roald: Wait. That's right! I finally remembered! I've got something to ask of you.
Paimon: Well, well, what a surprise!
Roald: Haha, uh, sorry...
Roald: As you know, I have a rather shameful habit of constantly forgetting things.
Roald: My poor memory has gotten me into hot water more than a few times, especially since I'm an adventurer and all...
Roald: And one of my goals for coming to Tsurumi Island was to collect something known as Fluorescent Fungi. According to Sango, these fungi can help improve one's memory and relieve strain on one's brain. It's said that they can even improve visual acuity.
Roald: The last time I came here with Kama, I was so preoccupied with "meeting the locals" that I forgot to collect any... *sigh*
Roald: I also didn't expect that I would encounter so much trouble after coming to the island on my own. It's a real shame...
Roald: So if you still have adventuring plans in this area, could you help me pick a few of these Fluorescent Fungi?
Traveler: Sure.
Roald: Thank you so much!
Traveler: Just don't forget about me when the time comes.
Roald: Haha! I won't, don't worry!
Traveler: That's a shame.
Roald: *sigh* It is, isn't it?
Traveler: We're still exploring this place.
Roald: Is that so? Haha! Well, don't let me slow you down, then!

## Talk 2

Roald: Hello there, you two! Found anything lately?
Traveler: Not yet, no.
Roald: No rush. I'll be here waiting!
Roald: Thanks for the Fluorescent Fungi you gave me, by the way. They're really fresh!
Paimon: Yeah, yeah, easy for you to say. Didn't we give you those mushrooms in the first place?
Roald: Ah, come now, don't sweat the small stuff. I mean, I've been eating them, haven't I?
Paimon: ...You... You forgetful...
Traveler: We're working on it.
Roald: Rest here for a bit if you're tired, maybe have a Fluorescent Fungus or two!

## Talk 3

Roald: #Hello there, Traveler! And hello there, Traveler's gabby fairy friend!
Paimon: And hello to you too, Mister Forgetful!
Paimon: Paimon. Is. Paimon! Don't you forget that!
Roald: I won't, Little Paimon.
Paimon: ...Wait, were you just playing Paimon!? Where did your manners go?
Paimon: #You know what, Traveler? Just give this guy those weird mushrooms already. Paimon's not talking to him!
Traveler: Will this be enough?

## Talk 4

Roald: Hmm, this should be enough, yes! Thank you ever so much!
Roald: By the way, if you find anything interesting near the island's ceremonial site, do give me a shout as well.
Roald: Hmm. Ah, yes. I do believe that you have a Fontaine-built Kamera with you, right? That's a rather expensive gadget to be sure... I should really get myself one of those, should my budget allow.
Roald: I've heard local historians say that the ancient natives of Tsurumi Island would use paintings to depict ancient, now-unremembered history onto the rock walls of caves, and that most of these murals have lasted over a thousand years now...
Roald: During my previous trip here, I was able to catch a glimpse of these images by ceremonial fire-light... They occupied my thoughts for several restless nights, and were most hard to forget indeed.
Roald: I don't believe that anyone has ever witnessed the murals in full, but if you could bring back proof of their existence, this will surely constitute a major breakthrough for the Adventurers' Guild in the field of historical academia.
Roald: If you find those legendary murals, take as many clear pictures of them as you can. I will purchase the photos from you for use in my diaries for a fair price and reward you for your trouble to boot.
Roald: What do you say? Is this arrangement acceptable?
Traveler: It'll do.
Roald: Thank you very much!
Traveler: As long as you don't lose your diary again.
Roald: I'll... I'll try my best.

## Talk 5

Roald: #We meet again, Traveler, and your, uh, um...
Paimon: ...?
Roald: Could I ask what you'd sell this flying fellow for? I think she's quite interesting!
Paimon: Eh!?
Traveler: Are you alright...?
Paimon: He's clearly not alright! This guy's having that amnesia thing again!
Roald: What on earth are you saying... *hurk*
Roald: *hurk*... Ahahahaha!
Paimon: ??
Traveler: ???
Roald: Hahahaha! *cough* Ahahah! Just... Just look at the looks on your faces! Hehahah!
Roald: I'm done... I'm out of breath... S—Sorry... This... Ahahaha... This is a favored "joke" of mine, you know?
Paimon: It's not funny at all!
Traveler: I'm afraid I don't get your sense of humor.
Roald: *cough* Alright, alright, no more jokes. I'm sorry.
Paimon: Really! Paimon thought a famous adventurer like you would be a more serious person!
Roald: Haha. It might be best not to have too fixed a view of adventurers. The Guild is well-known as a circle of oddities. I'd even call myself "normal" amidst their ranks.
Paimon: ...Not by much, Paimon thinks.
Roald: Still, thank you for those mushrooms. Their effects haven't been all that evident so far. Perhaps they need long-term use to really take effect, or maybe they don't have medicinal properties at all... But either way, they taste pretty good.
Roald: I should be careful not to finish all of these. I need to leave some for my friend in Sumeru who can help to research any medicinal properties that they may have.
Paimon: I feel like you're just going to forget this...
Roald: *cough* Ahem, well, back on topic. Have the two of you gone looking for the murals yet?
Traveler: Well, here's the photos that you wanted.
Roald: Ooh, my thanks for your most generous aid!
Roald: Let's see. Interesting, very interesting. Hmm... Did you find any other murals?
Traveler: This is all of them.
Roald: Hmm, that's even more interesting, then.
Paimon: What do you mean?
Roald: The people of Tsurumi Island used to worship a monstrous bird that wielded the power of Electro, and their civilization was centered around rituals and other ceremonial affairs to this effect. Most people who know something of history do not contest this view...
Roald: But the murals that you've provided show no sign of the Thunderbird's presence at all. It seems that the people worshiped something else altogether—
Roald: That is to say, the sun, moon, and stars... and whatever these strange symbols represent. Perhaps Tsurumi Island's natives already had a certain degree of civilization before the Thunderbird's descent...
Roald: Other than those, the fog and the moonlight, the stars and the darkness... Hmm, I can't explain these...
Paimon: Best not to use your head too much, Roald. Who knows what that'll do to your memory...
Roald: ...Ah, yes. Sorry. I was lost in thought. Barely even noticed you two, really.
Roald: Thanks once again for your hard work. I think this much is enough for me to write my next diary... If it gets picked up by some historians, I won't forget to add the two of you to the acknowledgments section!
Roald: Alright then. I think it's time I reported back to the Guild. Sorry for all the time I've taken up. May we meet again!
Paimon: What a busy guy...
Roald: Ah, right. There is one other thing. Nothing major, mind, but I hope that you could help me look out for someone. It's that child I mentioned earlier, whose name was... Um... Give me a moment...
Roald: Right, "Ruu." That was his name. I brought some things along this time for him to eat... I hope they're still fresh.
Roald: Ever since the last time I came here, I've been thinking about that kid. I can't imagine that life has been easy for him on such a perilous island.
Roald: #Alright, you'll hear no more from me. Let us meet again on the next leg of our respective journeys, Traveler! Ad astra abyssosque!
Traveler: These were all we could find.
Traveler: I guess this is how forgetful people survive, eh?
Traveler: Did the Fluorescent Fungus from before work?
Paimon: That's right! Why does it seem like he's gotten worse instead!?
