# Furious Mouth of the Spring


## Talk 1

Pahsiv: ...Melusine!
Paimon: Pahsiv? Where did you come from?
Pahsiv: Disappeared, Pahsiv.
Paimon: Alright, sure, but get away from that vishap! It's dangerous!
Pahsiv: Good Paimon, Pahsiv! Danger, Melusine.
Black Screen Text: Pahsiv reaches out to stroke the vishap's head and the furious beast obediently lies down.
It opens its mouth, coughs up a glittering drop of water, then jumps back into the water.
Pahsiv: Key, key, Pahsiv!
Paimon: Woah. The vishap gave you the key when you asked for it. That was unexpected...
Pahsiv: Blue thing, good thing, key, protect.
Traveler: By blue thing, you mean that vishap?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv!
Paimon: Was it helping you look after the key? Are you and the vishap friends?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv!
Pahsiv: Purple thing, steal key... Blue thing, fainted...
Paimon: P—Purple thing? Who is that?
Pahsiv: #Purple thing, bad thing! Blue thing, Paimon, Traveler, good thing!
Paimon: Err... Okay. It all seems a bit odd, but it does seem like you're praising us.
Pahsiv: Purple thing, very bad, Erinnyes, very Melusine...
Paimon: Still, Paimon's never met a Melusine as unique as you... We thought Melusine all lived in the Court of Fontaine or Merusea Village. How come you're here?
Pahsiv: Court of Fontaine? Merusea Village?
Paimon: You seem confused. Haven't you heard of those places?
Pahsiv: Court of Fontaine, Melusine... Merusea Village, Melusine...
Pahsiv: Ah... Erinnyes, Pahsiv, home.
Pahsiv: Erinnyes, Pahsiv, protect!
Paimon: Wait, you're saying that this is your home? And that you're protecting it?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv!
Traveler: But don't the Melusine live in Merusea Village?
Paimon: Yes, that's kinda strange. Are some Melusine born elsewhere? Paimon can't see any others here though.
Paimon: Pahsiv, do you live here alone?
Pahsiv: Alone? Melusine. That visitor! Pahsiv!
Paimon: That... visitor? There's a visitor? Who?
Pahsiv: #That.. visitor! Paimon, Paimon, Traveler, Traveler. That visitor, that visitor!
Traveler: So who is that visitor, exactly?
Paimon: Pahsiv... are you trying to say that visitor is called that visitor, like Paimon is called Paimon?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv!
Paimon: Ah-ha! I was right. Paimon's always said that she's clever, hasn't she?
Traveler: It's a very strange name.
Traveler: That's an awesome name.
Pahsiv: That visitor, Pahsiv, knowledge, ka-pow.
Paimon: Err... you mean that the visitor is helping you learn things?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv! Lots of. Language, wisdom... lots of.
Paimon: Er, Paimon's not sure about the "lots of" bit...
Pahsiv: Pahsiv, that visitor, protect, ka-pow.
Paimon: And he helps you protect this place?
Pahsiv: Melusine...
Traveler: You help him protect this place?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv!
Paimon: So that's it... But who is this visitor? And why does he need you to help protect this place, anyway?
Paimon: Some bad things have happened here, too. We saw the stone tablet and how someone had scratched out the inscription. And we saw lots of filth... Was it all because of the purple thing?
Pahsiv: Curious Paimon, Pahsiv! But time very not lots of.
Pahsiv: Key, key, key, square, west, ka-pow, ka-pow.
Traveler: We'll be as quick as we can!
Pahsiv: #Paimon, Pahsiv! Traveler, Pahsiv!
Black Screen Text: Pahsiv gives two happy jumps and then leaves in a bit of a hurry.
Paimon: It looks like we really are pressed for time. But we've already got two keys, so let's press on and get the third!

## Talk 2

Slumbering Vishap (Motionless Vishap): (A vishap is lying over there. Is it asleep or...)

## Talk 3

Paimon: Look out! There's a vishap by the altar! It seems to be sleeping, but we should be careful...
Paimon: Paimon's carefully examined the altar... It seems to have been activated already. But nothing has changed nearby...
Slumbering Vishap (Furious Roar): Raargh!
Paimon: Oh no! The vishap woke up. We'd better scoot!
Black Screen Text: The vishap by the altar shakes itself awake, its eyes full of anger and hate...
You swim for the shore as fast as you can, but it isn't giving up...

## Talk 4

Pahsiv: ...Melusine!
Paimon: Pahsiv, what are you doing here? Get away from the vishap! It's dangerous!
Pahsiv: Good Paimon, Pahsiv! Danger, Melusine.
Black Screen Text: Pahsiv reaches out to stroke the vishap's head and the furious beast obediently lies down.
It opens its mouth, coughs up a glittering drop of water, then jumps back into the water.
Paimon: It's a key! The vishap had it in its mouth all the time! But how come it gave it up so willingly?
Pahsiv: Blue thing, good thing, key, protect.
Traveler: By blue thing, you mean that vishap?
Paimon: Pahsiv, are you and the vishap friends? Was it helping you look after the key?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv!
Pahsiv: Purple thing, steal key... Blue thing, fainted...
Paimon: P—Purple thing? Who is that?
Pahsiv: #Purple thing, bad thing... Blue thing, Paimon, Traveler, good thing!
Paimon: Err... Okay. It all seems a bit odd, but it does seem like you're praising us.
Pahsiv: Purple thing, very bad, Erinnyes, very Melusine...
Paimon: You're saying that... the purple thing is threatening the island? Well, at least we have the keys.
Pahsiv: #Paimon, Traveler, Pahsiv! But...
Pahsiv: Key, key, key, square, west...
Paimon: Paimon knows. Don't worry, Pahsiv. We're going to the square in the west right now.

## Talk 5

Pahsiv (???): ...Ah!
Paimon: Why's there a Melusine here? Hey! Get away from that vishap! It's dangerous!
Black Screen Text: The newly appeared Melusine reaches out to stroke the vishap's head and the furious beast obediently lies down.
It opens its mouth, coughs up a glittering drop of water, then jumps back into the water.
Paimon: Eh? What was that?
Pahsiv (???): Key.
Paimon: Key? What key? Is this drop of water a key?
Pahsiv (???): Pahsiv.
Paimon: Err... The drop of water is Pahsiv?
Pahsiv (???): Melusine.
Paimon: Ugh! What do you mean? Is the drop of water a Melusine? Paimon's getting dizzy. What on earth is this? Aren't you the Melusine here?
Pahsiv (???): Pahsiv...
Paimon: Err... You're a Pahsiv? Or is your name Pahsiv? Wait... No, don't answer. You'll just make Paimon dizzier...
Paimon: Anyway, Paimon's decided to call you Pahsiv. Is that okay?
Pahsiv (Pahsiv?): Melusine...
Paimon: #Traveler... What should we do? Paimon can't understand a thing she's saying. What is she trying to say?
Traveler: You can understand what we're saying, can't you?
Pahsiv (Pahsiv?): Pahsiv...
Traveler: This drop of water is a key, right?
Pahsiv (Pahsiv?): Pahsiv.
Traveler: You're not a human, are you?
Pahsiv (Pahsiv?): Pahsiv!
Paimon: Er... Let's not be rude all of a sudden, shall we?
Traveler: I'm not a human, am I?
Pahsiv (Pahsiv?): M—Melusine?
Paimon: Oh! Wait! Paimon thinks she's starting to understand. "Pahsiv" is yes and "Melusine" is no. Could that be it?
Pahsiv (Pahsiv?): Pahsiv! Pahsiv!
Pahsiv (Pahsiv?): Pahsiv! Pahsiv!
Paimon: So you're not called Pahsiv. Sorry, Paimon got your name wrong earlier.
Pahsiv (Pahsiv?): Pahsiv... likes...
Traveler: You like the name?
Pahsiv (Pahsiv?): Pahsiv!
Paimon: #Wonderful! Then that's what Paimon will call you, hehe. This is Traveler. We're glad to meet you. And thanks for chasing that vishap off.
Pahsiv: Blue thing, good thing, key, protect.
Traveler: By blue thing, you mean that vishap?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv!
Paimon: Was it helping you look after the key? Are you and the vishap friends?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv!
Pahsiv: Purple thing, steal key... Blue thing, fainted...
Paimon: P—Purple thing? Who is that?
Pahsiv: #Purple thing, bad thing! Blue thing, Paimon, Traveler, good thing!
Paimon: Err... Okay. It all seems a bit odd, but it does seem like you're praising us.
Pahsiv: Purple thing, lots bad, Erinnyes, Melusine...
Paimon: Erinn-yes Melusine? Err... Erinn-no?
Traveler: Something wrong with Erinnyes?
Pahsiv: Erinnyes, Melusine, now...
Pahsiv: Pahsiv, Erinnyes, protect...
Paimon: So, something bad is happening to Erinnyes, and you want to protect it?
Pahsiv: #Paimon, Traveler, Erinnyes, ka-pow, ka-pow...
Paimon: Er... So... you want us to wham-bam ka-pow Erinnyes a couple of times?
Pahsiv: Melusine!
Traveler: You want us to help?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv!
Paimon: Okay, so she wants help from us. That's good. Paimon didn't know how we could punch Erinnyes, with it being a whole island and all...
Pahsiv: Ka-pow, ka-pow.
Traveler: Will there be any rewards?
Traveler: What do we need to do?
Pahsiv: Re... ward?
Paimon: #Oh come on, Traveler! Pahsiv can barely talk! She won't be able to find anyone else to help her, so we should just do it!
Traveler: What do we need to do?
Pahsiv: Key, key, key, number.
Paimon: And then? How many keys is that, now?
Pahsiv: Key! Key! Key!
Traveler: Three keys?
Pahsiv: Pahsiv! Key, foggy path, south...
Pahsiv: Key, spring, north...
Pahsiv: Key, willow, east...
Paimon: Oh, that's what you mean... Let's make a note real quick... Three keys in total, one in the southern foggy road, one in the northern spring, and one in the eastern willows... Is Paimon right?
Pahsiv: Key, key, key, square, west.
Paimon: And there are three keys in the square to the west?
Traveler: Collect three keys and go to the square?
Pahsiv: #Paimon, Melusine! Traveler, Pahsiv!
Paimon: #Oh c'mon, Pahsiv, do you have to always make it sound like Traveler is cleverer than Paimon? We're clearly of more or less equal intellect!
Paimon: Anyway, we've already got one key, so all we need to do is find the remaining two.
Pahsiv: Erinnyes, Melusine... Pahsiv, protect!
Paimon: Relax. Paimon doesn't know what's happened, but we're going to help you protect Erinnyes for sure.
Paimon: But if Paimon could add one small point, Pahsiv, Paimon would like to say that if you happen to see anything shiny, round, and unwanted, or some expensive-looking chest...
Paimon: Well, it would be just wonderful if you could let us know!
Black Screen Text: Pahsiv scratches her head as she tries to understand, then gives two more happy jumps and leaves in a bit of a hurry.
Paimon: #Oh, she ran straight off. Guess she must have something really urgent to work on. Traveler, shall we go looking for those two keys now?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Paimon: Look out! There's a vishap by the altar! It seems to be sleeping, but we should be careful...
Paimon: Huh? How come... How come there's no key? Has the altar already been activated? Has someone already taken the key?
Slumbering Vishap (Furious Roar): Raargh!
Paimon: Oh no! The vishap woke up. We'd better scoot!
Black Screen Text: The vishap by the altar shakes itself awake, its eyes full of anger and hate...
You swim for the shore as fast as you can, but it isn't giving up...
