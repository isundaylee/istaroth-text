Shaghayeh: Hello, are you a visitor here too?

Traveler: Is this a popular tourist attraction?
Shaghayeh: Haha, I'm sorry to say that it isn't. This is just a private residence.
Shaghayeh: People visit here from time to time because this place was designed by a famous architect.
Shaghayeh: But it's still a private residence, so please forgive me for being unable to give you an indoor tour.
Shaghayeh: Oh... I almost forgot. Please don't spread the word about this location.
Shaghayeh: While the Lord doesn't mind people taking a tour of the garden, this place was priced for the peace and quiet away from the hubbub of the world. So, I hope you understand.
