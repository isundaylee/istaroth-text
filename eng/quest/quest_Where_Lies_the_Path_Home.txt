# Where Lies the Path Home


## Talk 1

Paimon: Although they all look about the same, some Fungi are friendly, while others are super aggressive and attack anyone they see.
Nahida: It can't be helped. Perhaps in their eyes, humans are like fierce "monsters" as well.
Nahida: After all, they can't distinguish which human behaviors are hostile or not, and it'd already be too late for them once humans have drawn their weapons.
Nahida: Hence why they tend to strike first, rather than waiting.
Paimon: That's not too different from how humans think sometimes...
Nahida: That's what I meant by shared emotions.

## Talk 2

Floating Hydro Fungus: !
Floating Hydro Fungus: !!!
Nahida: It appears it was in a hurry because of this unconscious Fungus.
Paimon: Hmm, seems like they might be family.
Paimon: So maybe this Fungus wanted to bring Nahida here to help its family member.
Nahida: Probably. Although Fungi are simple creatures, they're very sensitive to elemental power.
Nahida: Maybe it noticed me on my way back and thought I'd be able to help.
Nahida: I'll take a look. I should be able to help if it's just a common illness...
Nahida: Hmm?
Paimon: What is it, Nahida?
Nahida: Strange... very strange...
Nahida: This Fungus didn't develop from a spore. It's an elemental life-form.
Paimon: Huh? An elemental life-form?
Nahida: Yes. Although the Fungi you normally see are capable of using elemental powers, they're merely borrowing elemental power from nature around them.
Nahida: As for this Fungus... It has elemental power flowing through it. Definitely not anything like your typical Fungus.
Traveler: So you're saying...
Nahida: Exactly. This is very interesting, I've never seen anything like it.
Paimon: So this is a first, even for Nahida...
Nahida: But that's not all... there's a large void within its elemental power.
Nahida: The void is stopping the elemental power from flowing normally, which must be why it fainted.
Paimon: So do you think it'll wake up if we can fill the void?
Nahida: Yes, and I just so happen to be good at this sort of thing. I'll see what I can do right away.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: ...
Floating Hydro Fungus: !!!
Floating Hydro Fungus: ♪~
Nahida: My power was compatible. Looks like everything is fine now.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Lord of Dendro... Is it really the Lord of Dendro?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Oh, I can't believe the Lord of Dendro saved me... Thank you, as well as the stranger and creature next to you.
Paimon: Wah! It can talk!?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Oh, I didn't expect such a strange creature to make a sound like that. Seems I'm just as shocked as you are.
Paimon: What!? Of course Paimon can talk! And Paimon isn't a strange creature — Paimon's just... Paimon!
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Hello, Paimon. I am not yet able to evaluate an organism's intelligence from its appearance. I will only know you are able to speak once you have spoken.
Paimon: Oh, uh, well no need to take it seriously. It's no big deal...
Paimon: But does Paimon really look so dumb that people might think Paimon doesn't know how to talk?
Traveler: There's no need to start worrying about that all of a sudden...
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: You misunderstand, Paimon. A mouth is used for eating, breathing, and other functions that are more important than speaking.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: So a creature may not speak, even if it has a mouth. I've never seen a creature like you before, so I dared not make the assumption that you could speak.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Even if you do possess a number of human traits, it is still very common for creatures to have similar external forms but completely different interiors — just like Fungi and Slimes.
Paimon: Did this Fungus study at the Akademiya...? It seems even more talkative than Paimon...
Nahida: You're not a Fungus, are you?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: That's correct. This might be surprising to you, and I'm sure that you must have questions. Let's find somewhere else to talk.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: It might startle my fellow "family members" if I speak too much using this strange voice.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: ♪~♪♪~
Floating Hydro Fungus: ♪~
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: It says that it's very thankful for your help.
Traveler: It only looks like a Fungus?

## Talk 3

Nahida: There's something that I'm very concerned about.
Traveler: Are you talking about that crystal?
Nahida: Yes. I didn't mention it just now, but do you remember when I told you that the power in the crystal is very similar to mine, yet also different?
Nahida: The elemental power inside the crystal is completely identical to that of the Fungus.
Paimon: What!?
Traveler: There's a connection between the crystal and the Fungus...
Nahida: Exactly. The prophecy that it mentioned was probably an agreement that I made with an elemental life-form that once represented its race.
Nahida: I had to deal with the forbidden knowledge to save their homeland. The process, however, took away some of my memories.
Nahida: That sequence of events would explain the persistent feeling that I had unfinished business.
Paimon: Makes sense... Too bad it's unable to tell us more.
Nahida: Yeah, I've been trying to think of a place that fits the description of its homeland, but I'm unable to come up with anything.
Traveler: We'll just have to continue investigating.
Nahida: Agreed. I really want to send them home, so they won't have to wander around anymore.
Traveler: Are you talking about your fuzzy memories?

## Talk 4

Floating Anemo Fungus: ♩~♩~♩♩

## Talk 5

Paimon: It's... The Withering!
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Yes, I have heard humans also call it that before.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: It's the last form we take when we are at the end of our life.
Paimon: Uh, Paimon doesn't understand...
Nahida: It's trying to say that when they've suffered enough and reached the end of their life, they become a Tumor of the Withering.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Yes. I would have also suffered the same fate if it wasn't for the Lord of Dendro's help.
Paimon: So this is how "The Withering" is formed...?
Nahida: Previous research has revealed that forbidden knowledge is the root cause of The Withering.
Nahida: But even if forbidden knowledge has been completely removed, its influence still remains, which is why The Withering remains even after forbidden knowledge has disappeared.
Nahida: They've been tormented by forbidden knowledge for a long time. It's understandable that they will eventually become The Withering.
Nahida: But what a sad and pitiful end...
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: When I left my homeland, flowers like these filled the fields. Each bloom represented an individual life.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: They grew in the pristine lakes, in the fertile soil, in my home, and in the homes of my friends...
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: They grew everywhere. Until the world suddenly lost all its color and became tainted and murky.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: But it's alright. Our life essence — elemental power — still resides in this flower.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: After an adventurer clears The Withering, I will quietly draw near the area. If I can sense the elemental power of my companions, then I take them with me.
Nahida: But that would mean the effects of forbidden knowledge could've...
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: It's okay. That's not important anymore. I just hope that they can all make it back home.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: It's not right to leave them to simply perish in the open like this.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Now that we finally have the chance to return home, each one I manage to bring back will make me that much happier.
Nahida: I understand. Just leave it to us.
Traveler: I got this.
Nahida: So you're worried about me...
Nahida: Hehe, it's fine. Forbidden knowledge doesn't exist anymore.
Nahida: It's natural to want to be over-cautious when dealing with a highly venomous snake, but when all that's left is its skeleton, there's nothing to worry about.
Traveler: ...If you say so.
Paimon: Uh, Paimon doesn't get what you two are talking about, but we're all ready to go now, right?
Paimon: Then let's do this! We've dealt with The Withering countless times already!
Traveler: This is a product of forbidden knowledge, after all.

## Talk 6

Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: As I expected, it's the last of my kind that I'm aware of.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: So it wasn't able to make it to the end. If only it could have held on just a little longer...
Nahida: I hope that you will be free of this pain after returning home.
Paimon: Just thinking about how many elemental life-forms have turned into Tumors of the Withering makes Paimon sad.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: It's okay. As long as elemental power still exists, then we will still be around.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: An external form is but a gift of time. Through "growth" comes change, and even abandonment of previous forms. However, our true nature is not so easily affected.
Nahida: It wouldn't have come to this if we were able to cure them earlier...
Nahida: But I will cure all of them... even if it's just for the sake of the rainforest and all the life-forms that live in it.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Thank you, Lord of Dendro. It was a wise choice for us to place our trust in you and wait.
Nahida: Hold on. I think I got something.
Nahida: ...Oh, I see. Okay, I understand. Thank you so much.
Nahida: So, they found a Fungus that matches the description I gave them. It's currently unconscious.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: It must be in a similar situation as I was. We should hurry and go take a look.
Nahida: Okay, follow me.

## Talk 7

Nahida: We're close now. It's just a little further inside.
Paimon: But there are so many Fungi here. They're probably all ordinary Fungi, right?
Traveler: If we startle them...
Paimon: Yeah, they won't be happy to see us.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: No fighting. These are all its family.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Although we belong to different species, we've spent a long time living among the Fungi. They are very important to us.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: They can be reasonable as long as we try to communicate.
Paimon: What should we do? You're the only one who can make it through, right?
Paimon: But you'll need Nahida's power if you want to save that Fungus.
Nahida: I've got an idea. Can you teach me how to change into a Fungus?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: You want to transform into a Fungus? But we don't have time for growth...
Paimon: Nahida is a god. Changing into a Fungus should be a piece of cake for her.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Even gods can't bend the laws of time so easily.
Nahida: Then we'll have to enter with the risk of being noticed. We may not be able to avoid a fight.
Nahida: But if spending some of my power will guarantee the safety of you and its family, then I am willing to try.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Alright. You have great elemental power, so you may be able to do it.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: You will have to use power equal to that which is required to break through the limitations of time.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: I will lend you the relevant knowledge that I have. It should make your transformation process a little easier.
Nahida: Alright, I'm ready. Changing into a Fungus should be quite an interesting experience.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Lord of Dendro, this is nothing to joke about. I am extremely serious about this.
Nahida: Hmm? As am I. I'm not joking at all.
Paimon: Alright, alright, let's not get hung up here. If it's really possible to turn into a Fungus, then why don't we give it a try now?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Okay. Good luck, Lord of Dendro.
Paimon: Wow! You really turned into a Fungus!
Traveler: So, how does it feel?
Nahida: It's actually not too bad. My perspective in this form isn't much different from usual.
Nahida: The unconscious Fungus is just below here. Can you all help me determine which one it is?
Paimon: Oh, how do we do that?
Nahida: I'll get close to them while you make your way over from above.
Nahida: You should be able to identify them using Elemental Sight since they're elemental life-forms.
Nahida: Then, all you have to do is repeat the correct answer in your mind. As long as I'm able to see you, then I'll be able to hear your answer.
Paimon: Okay, got it!
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Let me lure away the Fungi up top and make way for you.
Paimon: #Alright, good luck, Nahida. Let's go, Traveler!
Traveler: How do you like it?
Traveler: We won't be able to avoid a fight.

## Talk 10

Nahida: (Ah, so this is the one. Understood.)
Black Screen Text: Nahida uses her elemental power on the Fungus.
Black Screen Text: Seeing their companion regain consciousness, the nearby Fungi lower their guard against you.
Black Screen Text: You successfully meet up with Nahida, and she returns to her original form.
Nahida: *panting*... Whew...
Paimon: Nahida, what's wrong?
Nahida: I never knew that it was so tiring to change forms like that.
Nahida: I even used the techniques that it taught me... Seems like its warnings were not unfounded.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: The power of time accumulates slowly and goes unnoticed. A great price is to be paid if you wish to perform drastic changes instantly.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Thank you for everything you've done. All seems to have gone according to plan. Now we simply wait for it to wake up.
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: Who... are you?
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: I apologize. Language... is not... easy. Need... long... time...
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: It's okay, I have good news. Let me explain it to you the Fungi way.
Black Screen Text: A while later...
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: Apocalypse... ended. Go home... now?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Yes. Unfortunately, I've forgotten where home is. I was hoping you still remembered.
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: I... remember.
Paimon: Really? That's great!
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: Home... Dendro Dragon.
Traveler: Dendro Dragon?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Dendro Dragon... Ah... Yes! The Dendro Dragon!
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: I'm sorry, I just got so excited. I've probably never expressed such emotions before. But yes, our home is the Dendro Dragon.
Paimon: W—Wait a minute, Paimon's confused! Do you mean the Dendro Dragon as in an elemental dragon? Like Dvalin?
Nahida: Yes. They're both dragons but Apep, the Dendro Dragon, has been around for longer and has accumulated dense elemental power...
Nahida: But I don't quite understand — why would you say that your homeland is a dragon?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Because we live inside the Dendro Dragon.
Paimon: Uh...
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: The Dendro Dragon... Inside... Very big... Mountains... water... trees... us.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: There is an entire world inside the Dendro Dragon's body. The Dendro Dragon nurtured the earliest life-forms, and protected us inside of itself.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: It once told us in a majestic voice that once we've finally matured, we'd be able to start life in a new world.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: However, that day never came. Our homeland was the greatest place there ever was before the apocalypse arrived.
Paimon: Paimon's still confused...
Traveler: Is it like... Dendro Slimes giving birth to smaller slimes?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Yes, a very good example. It appears that you're much smarter than Paimon. The only difference is that the Dendro Dragon is much, much larger than any Dendro Slime.
Nahida: Wait... Then if that's the case... Doesn't that imply that Apep has also been contaminated by forbidden knowledge?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Yes, that is correct.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: What has suddenly made you look so worried, Lord of Dendro? I haven't seen this expression on you before.
Nahida: Apep is the most adaptable life-form in the world. The forbidden knowledge should've become a part of its body a long time ago.
Nahida: Which means that if all the forbidden knowledge has been eliminated...
Paimon: Then a big void will also form inside the dragon!
Nahida: I'm afraid so... Its body and soul have probably been in terrible shape for some time now.
Nahida: No wonder I haven't seen Apep for so long. But how did it get contaminated...? Was it due to the destruction of King Deshret's civilization?
Nahida: Hmm... But anyway, Apep disappeared and has been gone ever since that time. It's been enduring unimaginable pain all the while... It's probably in pain as we speak...
Traveler: So saving the Dendro Dragon is the important thing you need to do?
Nahida: Yes! How could I have forgotten!?
Nahida: If the Dendro Dragon fails to hang on, the elemental power inside it will no longer be able to maintain its form, and will all be dispersed.
Nahida: Dendro elemental power of that concentration will cause the rainforest to overgrow...
Nahida: Giant trees will completely block out the sun... Plants and humans will fight over oxygen... Sumeru will no longer be suitable for sustaining life!
Traveler: Nahida, get ahold of yourself.
Paimon: Hey, what about the crystal? Why don't you show it to them and see if they know anything about it?
Nahida: *sigh* Yes, I'm sorry... You're right. We don't have time to panic.
Nahida: Have you two ever seen anything like this before?
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: No.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Its power feels very familiar... like something from our homeland, but I don't know what it is.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: I'm sorry, our memories aren't very reliable.
Nahida: It's okay. I'll contact my helpers just as I did before and see if they can locate your other family members.
Nahida: I'm counting on you all, your info is crucial to us now.
Nahida: Let's wait for their reply again. Though I know waiting can feel unbearable at a time like this...
Floating Anemo Fungus: ♩~
Stretchy Anemo Fungus: ♬~♬~
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: Thank... you... Family... bringing... fruit.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: I explained to them that you aren't hostile. After seeing you save it, its family is very grateful to you.
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: Go home... Leave... Hard decision... Don't know.
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: They are... weak... I... Worry.
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: If waiting... Then... I hope...
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Don't worry, I understand what you are trying to say.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Family is very important to us, no matter when we were actually family. It has done a lot to protect this territory and can't help but worry now that it's about to leave.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Can you do one last thing for it while we wait?
Nahida: Of course. I can relate to how it's feeling.
Nahida: I need to organize my thoughts as well...
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: Thank you... Thank you.
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: Tend... Soil... Food.
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: Don't like... Plant... Invasion.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: There are two things that it wants you to do. One is to look after the land that the food is grown in, and the other is to drive away the plants that are trying to invade the area.
Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus: Soil... there. First... seed... here.
Paimon: Paimon understood that! No need to translate! We'll take care of it right away!

## Talk 17

Nahida: I was confident that I knew of all the creatures in Teyvat. Even if there are ones I've never seen with my own eyes, I thought I possessed all the relevant knowledge about them.
Nahida: However, even if I were to lay out the traits of all elemental life-forms, you don't seem to match any of them.
Nahida: What are you? And where did you come from?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: I come from an ancient race. We have existed for a very long time, possibly longer than any records in existence.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: My home was filled with flowing water and great mountains. Lush grass covered the land, and my family and I lived in bliss and happiness.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Until... the "apocalypse" came and changed my home forever...
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: A horrifying power consumed all there was... The seeds of catastrophe nested and grew inside of us... Twisting and warping us, causing us to lose control.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: We were victims of the apocalypse, yet in time, we also became the apocalypse itself.
Paimon: The "apocalypse"?
Nahida: I'm not sure what it means either. It sounds like some kind of old fable.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: It's a long and complicated story. It will take me some time to explain it clearly.
Nahida: Don't worry, we'll listen. Please continue.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: I was lucky and managed to survive. Afterward, I left with some of my family and came to Sumeru to search for a way to rescue my homeland.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: We came in contact with many species and learned from their cultures and knowledge, hoping to understand the truth behind the apocalypse.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: We later found out that humans know the power of the apocalypse, and refer to it as "forbidden knowledge."
Traveler: Forbidden knowledge...!
Paimon: Your home was destroyed by forbidden knowledge? Does that mean you're from the desert?
Nahida: It said that they are looking for a way to save their homeland, but the catastrophe of the desert should've ended a long time ago.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: The Lord of Dendro is correct. We are not from the desert. I would very much like to tell you the location of my homeland... But unfortunately, I've forgotten.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: That may sound a little odd... As it is very important to both me and my family.
Nahida: Yes, how could you forget?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: I am a life-form that was contaminated by the apocalypse. A part of my knowledge and memory was taken away as the contamination inside of me was purged.
Nahida: Ah, I get it now... So the void of elemental power was left behind from when the forbidden knowledge was purged.
Nahida: I'm sorry. I hadn't considered that kind of possibility...
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: That's okay. Lord of Dendro, there is no need to apologize. Without your help, I would've lost more than just my knowledge and memory.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: And not only did you save me, but you've also already rid the world of the remaining forbidden knowledge, right?
Nahida: That's right. The forbidden knowledge is no more, and your homeland should be safe now.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: My home... should be safe now. We can go home...
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: For the longest time, this moment has only seemed like a dream... I never knew it would become a reality so quickly.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: I was unable to fulfill our calling. I never found a way to save my homeland, and I have even forgotten where it is...
Nahida: It's not your fault. You've already done everything you can.
Nahida: Every species paid a grave price in the fight against forbidden knowledge. This is not a responsibility you should carry on your own.
Nahida: You mentioned that there were other survivors besides yourself. Where are they? Maybe they'll remember.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: The apocalypse put us through immense pain. Many of my family members have already met their end. I'm not sure who else is still alive...
Nahida: Don't worry, I should be able to find them. Just leave it to me.

## Talk 18

Nahida: My familiars will take the rainforest, and as for the city... There are a few nice kids who should be willing to help.
Paimon: Your familiars?
Nahida: Mm-hmm, they're a group of lovely little creatures. They're just a bit timid around strangers.

## Talk 19

Paimon: We've planted all the seeds. It's time to handle the invading plant life.

## Talk 20

Nahida: Give me a moment. I'll contact them right now.
Nahida: That should do it.
Nahida: It may take some time to find them, so let's wait for a bit.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Thank you, Lord of Dendro. We all believe that you will keep your promises.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: The moment I saw you when I awoke, I had a feeling you were here because of the agreement.
Nahida: Hmm? Agreement?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: You might not remember, but this is a prophecy that we deeply believe in... That the Lord of Dendro will bring us home once the catastrophe comes to an end.
Nahida: Oh, I see... I—I'm sorry, there are also some blurry segments in my memory as well.
Nahida: But I'm very concerned about your homeland. This is something I should help with, it's really no trouble to me at all.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Would you all be willing to come with me somewhere as we wait?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: The more family members that can return home with me... the better...
Paimon: But didn't you say that you don't know where they are?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Yes, but I know their "end." I will explain it to you along the way.

## Talk 21

Traveler: It wouldn't hurt to take a look.
Paimon: Hmm, that's true. Okay, let's go take a look.
Nahida: Alright, lead the way, little Fungus.

## Talk 22

Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Amazing. With such skills, you all would've definitely been able to find a way to survive the apocalypse.
Paimon: Hey, Paimon has been meaning to ask — you all didn't originally look like this, did you?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: No, we didn't. The appearance of our kind will change according to the environment.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: After communicating with various living organisms in Sumeru, we discovered that Fungi are the life-form most adapted to live in these lands.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Thus, we gradually took the form of Fungi and became a part of their group.
Paimon: It's hard to believe that's even possible!
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: The most important instinct any life-form possesses is adapting to the environment. I don't think that should surprise you, Paimon.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Your hand is shaped like that for a reason — so you are able to grip and use tools more easily.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: The reason why Fungi absorb elemental power is to blend with the environment and fend off natural predators.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: We are Dendro life-forms, one of the most ancient life-forms in this land. That is why we are so adaptable.
Paimon: So you mean... If Paimon wanted to, Paimon could change into a different form as well?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Not as freely, I'm afraid. You would require a long time to make that happen.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Although this is common sense to us, it is still extremely difficult to explain. Hmm... Putting it as simply as possible, changing form requires energy, and energy comes with time.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: You cannot make a sprout grow into a giant tree instantly, nor can you force a tree to bear fruit overnight.
Nahida: I see. Humans have a term for this, it's called "growth."
Paimon: Ahh, you're so smart, Nahida! Paimon gets it now!
Traveler: Seems like it's pretty good at coming up with metaphors as well...
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: "Growth"... I see. Yes, then this is what you would call growth.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: A most beautiful word. I shall enjoy it more as we walk.

Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Hmm, I think we may have a different understanding of "carrying" someone.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: No matter whether it's tired or not, my child is always happy when I put it on my back and give it a ride.
Paimon: Child? You mean the Fungi we ran into earlier?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Yes. One was my friend, and the other was my child.
Paimon: Why can't your kid speak?
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Because it's just a Fungus. I don't want my presence to change or affect the original state of the Fungi species here.
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: However, it is slightly different from an ordinary Fungus. It seems to understand some human language, so I gave it a name.
Paimon: Oh, then it must be a really cute name!
Paimon: You know, like Bongo-Head!
Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus: Hmm, you have an odd taste for names.
Paimon: Huh? Paimon thinks that name is great!
