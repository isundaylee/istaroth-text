# Muirne's Better Butter


## Talk 1

Traveler: About Butter...
Muirne: Whenever I go to eat some bread, they never give me enough butter to spread on it. I'm thinking that maybe I should just bring butter with me in the future.
Muirne: Did you bring the butter?
Traveler: Butter's ready.
Traveler: Not yet.
Muirne: I want a buttload of butter, so I can wait 'til you can give it to me all at once.

Muirne: Butteriffic! Oh, butter, my butter... Without butter, bread isn't even worth eating.
