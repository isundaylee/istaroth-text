Traveler: About Siman...
Khayyam: ...
Khayyam: Hm...? Oh, her...
Khayyam: "The child born in the middle of sands cherishes green more than anyone else." This sentence probably is about her...
Khayyam: She should have followed in her father's footsteps and become a mercenary, adventuring in the vast desert... But she chose the path of a researcher.
Khayyam: She was born cut out for a mercenary, through and through. To achieve her goals, she'd act regardless of the cost or the consequences, even her own life...
Khayyam: I tried to understand her, but I was too young, and it turned out quite unpleasant... So, it is as you see. We have been apart for many years... many decades, actually.
Khayyam: I hope she is doing well.
