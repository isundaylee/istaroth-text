# The Chasm Charters


## Talk 1

Xu: Ah, you're the Young Master's friends. How do you do?
Xu: Please accept my apologies, but I have something to ask of you. Is this a good time?
Traveler: Well, we're well-acquainted by now. Just speak your mind.
Xu: Well, here's the situation: there's this friend of mine named Muning who often helps us in business matters.
Xu: It's just that he wound up owing a small sum of Mora to the Yanshang Teahouse in recent days, leading to him asking our young master for help...
Xu: ...And the young master agreed without a second thought! Interest-free, if I might add. A most generous spirit... But best not one used while doing business, I fear.
Paimon: Oh, come on, he was just doing a guy some justice. Isn't that a good thing?
Xu: Yes, of course... But as you can see, Young Master Xingqiu has gone out to "right wrongs and enact justice," while I'm a little tied up with work back here. As such, the only person we can trust with the matter of delivering the Mora is you.
Xu: He should be working at The Chasm. He basically lives there, so I doubt you'll miss him.
Traveler: People actually still live at The Chasm?
Xu: Haha! Well, he is the specialist sent by the Ministry of Civil Affairs to the Chasm, after all!
Xu: Of course, that is a mine, so food, water, and daily necessities all need to be transported there from Liyue...
Xu: So there isn't much time for idling or for leisure, and life can be both tough and a little boring, but regardless, the remuneration is quite generous indeed.
Xu: Well... You are the great hero of Liyue. Perhaps it might still be a bit of a tall order to ask for huge favors, but I'm sure some people might be willing to make small exceptions for you, yes?
Xu: I believe that you'll be able to accomplish this task. If you do get stopped at the gates, though, come back here and we'll use some other methods instead.
Traveler: Well, I'll help for Xingqiu's sake.
Xu: Thank you so much!
Traveler: No concerns that I'll just pocket the sum?
Paimon: Hey! That's not something you say out loud!
Xu: Hahahaha! Come now, there's no need for such jokes. I trust you.
Traveler: Isn't The Chasm closed, though?
Traveler: Well, what's up?

## Talk 2

Xu: Again, I apologize for asking this favor of you, but we really are very busy at the moment. If there's any trouble, just come back later and we'll talk then.
Traveler: Could you tell me more about The Chasm?
Xu: Well, uh... Oh, right! Silly me. I can't believe I'm sending you out without even the briefest of introductions to The Chasm.
Xu: To be honest, though, I'm not sure I'll do a good job relating the matter to you... I think it was several years ago now when the miners unearthed something strange. What that is, I don't know â€” nor have I really had the courage to ask around.
Xu: Either way, this was reported to the Qixing by the Huishan Hall, and one of Ningguang's secretaries sent out an investigation team that returned and reported that there was some huge threat to everyone's safety, and that the mines must be closed...
Xu: As a result, the Chasm was rendered into its current state. The people of Shenglu Hall constantly ask when it will be reopened, but the Qixing will not allow it, leaving them to fret...
Traveler: Tell me about Muning.
Xu: Oh, him? His family is a big name in the porcelain industry. Pretty high up in Shenglu Hall... You know, the works. But he has little interest in the family business, and instead prefers to enjoy a life of leisure, going where the mood strikes him...
Xu: He's also absolutely no good with Mora, and he owes quite a few people as a result... For fear that he might ruin their business' reputation, the family had him sent to the Ministry of Civil Affairs as a representative to shape him up a bit...
Xu: It just so happened that the Ministry needed a professional from Shenglu Hall to oversee The Chasm, so he was picked as this specialist.
Xu: If you ask me, this is a good thing. According to my father, The Chasm is exactly the place to train one's character. Why, he did work there in the mines himself back when he was young...
Traveler: See you around, then.
Xu: Alright. Stay safe, now!
