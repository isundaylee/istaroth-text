Andrei: Tell me about the Northland Bank.
Andrei: This is actually a Snezhnayan bank that was opened here in Liyue Harbor. The building itself was constructed in accordance with the local Liyue style.
Andrei: However, many Liyue locals still seem to harbor some resentment towards our bank. They think that our presence here may be damaging the Liyue economy.
Andrei: But this clearly can be an opportunity that benefits everyone. As long as we can be fully integrated into the marketplace, the economy will only continue to grow more.
Andrei: As for our own nation's economy, we have the brilliance and foresight of Master Pantalone to thank.
Andrei: Oh, and we mustn't forget Her Majesty the Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya.
