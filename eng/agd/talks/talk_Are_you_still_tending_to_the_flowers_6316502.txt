Traveler: Are you still tending to the flowers?
Hanayama Kaoru: Yea, I actually want to go find more types of flower seeds, so I can plant even more kinds of flowers.
Hanayama Kaoru: By the way, do you know someone named Xavier?
Hanayama Kaoru: He's a really weird person. He saw the flowers I planted and got really excited. He ran up to me to ask if he could... what did he call it? I think it was something called "filming"?
Hanayama Kaoru: There was someone that looked like he was from the Shogun's Army with him. I got a little scared and asked what he wanted...
Hanayama Kaoru: He said that he wanted to have that Shogunate Samurai stand in middle of the flower field, swing his sword, and... uh, make some kind of "swashbuckler flick."
Hanayama Kaoru: I refused his request in the end, because I didn't want the flowers to be trampled... Man, what a weird person...
