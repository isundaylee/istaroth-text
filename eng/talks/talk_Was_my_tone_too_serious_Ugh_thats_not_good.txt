Paz: Was my tone too serious? Ugh, that's not good...
Paz: Traveler? Are you here to give "Mimetic Replication" a try?
Traveler: I'll give this one a go, why not?
Paz: Alright. In that case, please step over here.
Traveler: I've got some other things to do.
Paz: That's fine. My booth will be open throughout the Gala, so you can come over and try the game out any time.
