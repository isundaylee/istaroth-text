# Molting Season


## Talk 1

Angry Saurian Trafficker: Where did Acomitl go? Get out here, you little smooth-talking squirt!
Angry Saurian Trafficker: How come I haven't seen a single feather of that baby Qucusaurus you promised to sell me, huh? I dare you to stop hiding in that cellar and face up to me!

## Talk 2

Acomitl: The final results are divided into four tiers based on your scores. Please, you must at least reach the second-highest tier! You're my only hope for an excuse to leave the squad!
Acomitl: Beat the record that I set back in the days when I used to grit my teeth and put my all into it! I don't have the strength to do it myself now, so all I can do is ask for help.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Acomitl, we found you!
Acomitl: You actually found the cellar! And there was me thinking it was so well-hidden that you'd have given up trying to find it...
Paimon: C'mon, tell us what's going on! Those Saurian traffickers popping out of nowhere like that almost scared the life out of us.
Acomitl: You just have to get to the bottom of things, huh? The whole reason I holed up here in the first place was so I didn't have to dump all my trivial problems on someone else.
Acomitl: But it's true that you've been affected by this whole thing too... And seeing as you found your way here, I guess you deserve an explanation.
Acomitl: I'm Acomitl, from the Flower-Feather Clan. I just passed my Saurian riding exam, so that makes me a fully-fledged member of the flying squad.
Acomitl: Oh no, I guess now... I'd be considered a Wingless dropout. I wonder how the captain will deal with my case, though it's none of my concern anymore.
Acomitl: I'm sure you've heard that I didn't break any rules, nor did I try to profit from stealing Qucusaurus hatchlings.
Acomitl: As for the Saurian traffickers, don't worry about them. They won't be coming after you again.
Acomitl: No one in their right mind from the Flower-Feather Clan would just pick a fight with someone from the flying squad. Those guys who were trying to steal Saurians earlier were just thugs.
Acomitl: They were so on edge that they only dared corner me when I was alone. And now that you've given them a beating, I'm sure they won't tell a soul.
Traveler: How did you end up clashing?
Paimon: Yeah, what were they even thinking? Why would they go after someone from the flying squad?
Acomitl: No, it's got nothing to do with being a Saurian rider. The problem is me. Maybe I'm just... not meant to be a member of the flying squad.
Acomitl: Back when I was a reserve, I wanted to make it as an official member, so I trained relentlessly to be as fast as they were.
Acomitl: Days and nights of endless training, obsessing over the slightest mistakes and constantly doubting whether I was good enough.
Acomitl: I couldn't even speak to my parents and sister... I became irritable, lost my appetite, and stopped sleeping.
Acomitl: But after I finally passed the exam and became an official member, once again, I found myself constantly having to catch up with the captain.
Acomitl: I was never good enough! There was always someone more gifted, more hardworking than I was.
Acomitl: It's like a firefly, rising up into the sky for the very first time, being told that it had to catch up with a sparrow, and then once it did, that its next target was a shooting star.
Acomitl: It's exhausting. To tell you the truth, I've been regularly heading over to the Masters of the Night-Wind for paid therapy sessions, but even after spending all that money, I haven't seen any improvement.
Acomitl: I was just venting when I told those traffickers to take all the Saurians away, "the sooner the better." I didn't expect them to actually go ahead and do it.
Acomitl: Even hiding here didn't help, and I just ended up getting myself trapped in this cellar. I'm so sick of it all.
Paimon: Well... Everyone has their own problems. Even being an adventurer's a tough life, y'know.
Acomitl: Speaking of which, adventurers can take commissions, right? I need you to help me come up with a good reason for leaving the squad.
Traveler: You really want to be a Wingless?
Acomitl: Let me put it like this... When processing raw ores, people cut off the outer layer, don't they? Well, just think of me as the scrap material that gets left over.
Traveler: Is there really no other way?
Acomitl: If everyone's a gem, then no one is. Just let me be the waste product so the others can stand out.
Acomitl: Chasing a shooting star that you know you'll never catch is absolute torture... So please, just let me rest.
Acomitl: How about you fly with me, just once?
Acomitl: I need you to beat my record. Just think about it — if the first adventurer that happens to pass by can surpass me with such ease...
Acomitl: ...Then the instructors won't be able to say a thing! All that stuff about being a rare prodigy, about slacking off being a waste of not only my talent, but of life itself... It would all be nonsense!
Paimon: Uh oh, Paimon regrets getting him all worked up just now. In fact, she's starting to feel all guilty inside...
Paimon: What do we even say? Maybe we should just do what he wants and give it a shot...?
Traveler: Will that really work?
Acomitl: I think it will.
Traveler: Alright, I'll lend a hand.
Acomitl: Excellent! Let's continue this discussion somewhere a bit more... open.
Traveler: If that makes you feel better...
Traveler: Can't you just leave?
Acomitl: Even though I want to give up, I'm not brave enough to let them down in person. Please, forgive my lack of courage.
Acomitl: My captain will most likely consider my absence as no more than a punishable mistake, and the others won't let me leave that easily.
Acomitl: "It's okay! Just try a little harder! It'll all be fine!" Seriously, reassurances like these drive me crazy! I'd rather they just ignored me.
Acomitl: When everyone acts like that, how can I come to terms with being a good-for-nothing loser?
Traveler: Why would you agree to steal a Saurian?
Paimon: Yeah... Paimon would have thought that Saurian riders from the flying squad would cherish their Qucusaurs...

## Talk 4

Acomitl: Listen, the usual goal of a flying exam is to ride your Saurian along the course and score as highly as you can within a given time limit.
Acomitl: The flying squad's exams are extremely strict. During training, our instructor evaluates us and scores our performance at every checkpoint.
Acomitl: The final results are divided into four tiers based on your scores. Please, you must at least reach the second-highest tier! You're my only hope for an excuse to leave the squad!
Acomitl: Beat the record that I set back in the days when I used to grit my teeth and put my all into it! I don't have the strength to do it myself now, so all I can do is ask for help.

## Talk 5

Look Down (Cellar): (You hear rustling from below. Perhaps someone is hiding down there.)
Traveler: Hello? Anyone there?
Look Down (Cellar): ...
Acomitl (Young Man Called Acomitl): Who's there?
Paimon: We've driven off the Saurian traffickers, it's safe to come out now.
Acomitl (Young Man Called Acomitl): ...No thanks. Just leave me alone in this cellar.
Acomitl (Young Man Called Acomitl): Thanks for the help, but I don't have anything to give you.
Acomitl (Young Man Called Acomitl): I kept some stuff at the camp, though, if you want it. Help yourselves.
Traveler: So... No explanation for what just happened?
Acomitl (Young Man Called Acomitl): I'm sorry for getting you caught up in this mess, but no good will come from telling you, so forget it.
Paimon: #You call that an explanation? Paimon and Traveler were just taking a walk when someone suddenly charged at us, shouting something about giving us a good beating!
Paimon: #We might have gotten hurt if Traveler hadn't reacted as fast as he did. Actually, no, we did get hurt! We suffered emotional trauma!
Traveler: Our emotional trauma must be compensated.
Paimon: This is serious, y'know? We're well-known adventurers registered with the Adventurers' Guild, and we're under its protection. We demand an explanation!
Traveler: (Would the Guild actually protect us?)
Paimon: (Paimon's not sure about that either... But based on our past experience, she doubts it.)
Acomitl (Young Man Called Acomitl): But... I neither meant for that to happen, nor is it my fault that it did... And besides, you can't even get in here anyway.
Paimon: #Darn it, he's hiding in the cellar! C'mon Traveler, let's find a way in!
Acomitl (Young Man Called Acomitl): Don't waste your energy. Even if I told you that there were two paths from the camp to the cellar, *only Saurians know where they are*, so it wouldn't do you any good. You might as well just leave now.
Traveler: Look, my hand got scraped!

## Talk 6

Acomitl (Young Man Called Acomitl): That would mean having to fight you, so why would I do that? And besides, it's not like I accepted any of your money, anyway! I was just playing along for fun.
Acomitl (Young Man Called Acomitl): Stealing baby Qucusaurs is against our laws. Do I look like a fool to you?
Angry Saurian Trafficker: You're a gutsy one, huh? How dare you try to trick me! Go ahead then, hide away — I have all the time in the world! No one's coming to save you anyway.
Acomitl (Young Man Called Acomitl): ...You really so sure there's no one coming to save me?
Angry Saurian Trafficker: ...Hmm?
Angry Saurian Trafficker: You little... You actually went and ran for help, huh? Well, just so happens I'm fuming, so I'll just have to give them a good beating too.
Acomitl (Young Man Called Acomitl): Huh? Someone actually showed up!?
Paimon: #Huh? Why are we suddenly being attacked? Ugh, well... Guess it's time for you to do your thing, Traveler.

## Talk 7

Acomitl: Amazing! *sobs* You did it, you beat my record!
Acomitl: Now I can rest easy, knowing that once I've shown them this, they'll surely give up on me once and for all!
Acomitl: I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you so much!
Traveler: D—Don't mention it?
Acomitl: I'll never forget what you've done for me. Let me rest up for a moment, then I'll go see my captain right away.
Acomitl: Finally! I'm finally going to be free!
Traveler: As long as it helps you out.

## Talk 8

Acomitl: I'm heading back to the squad now, and it's all thanks to you.
Traveler: Hope it all works out for you...
Acomitl: I've got it all figured out. If my captain tries to convince me not to give up, or says that it's the same for everyone, I'll react like this:
Acomitl: Well, first I'll stay silent for a moment, and then I'll say, "I'm sorry, Captain, but I..." The key here is to create the impression that I feel completely and utterly dejected.
Acomitl: The goal is to make my captain realize that there really is no hope left for me, and that this isn't just an act.
Acomitl: If my captain attempts to take the whole "I'm so disappointed in you" reverse psychology approach, and then goes on to offer me another chance to turn my recent poor performances around, I'll react like this:
Acomitl: I'll look really sad, like I'm on the verge of shedding tears, but I won't actually let myself cry. Then I'll just say a short, "Thank you, Captain."
Acomitl: After that, I'll say that I feel like I'm a good-for-nothing loser too. The key here is to use the captain's words to make my point, so that what I'm saying can't be denied.
Acomitl: If the captain demands time to think it over, then sends my fellow riders to come talk to me, I'll...
Acomitl: Well, to be honest, that'll be a tough one. I'm not sure what I'd do if I found myself in a situation like that, mainly because I doubt I'd have the energy to deal with all my fellow riders...
Paimon: Whoa! Paimon thought the whole reason you dragged us into this was because you'd given up, and that you couldn't be bothered to think it through yourself.
Paimon: Who'd have thought you'd have made such detailed plans...
Acomitl: It's a natural defense mechanism that gets triggered when a person's in pain. You suppress your perception of the pain's source and focus on things that make you feel happy instead.
Acomitl: That's what the Masters of the Night-Wind told me during one of those therapy sessions. I'm paying them after all, so they have to give me some useful advice at least.
Traveler: Sounds pretty useless to me.
Acomitl: Have a little faith! I'm sure I'll manage to escape this time... I'm sure of it!
Acomitl: Oh, but before I go, there's something I should tell you.
Acomitl: When I was still in the reserve, my family built this as a place for me to train.
Acomitl: I don't think I'll be using it anymore, so I'm planning to take it apart and bring it with me. After all, I'll no longer be required to put myself through such arduous training... Haha.
Acomitl: But given everything you've done for me, I'll be leaving the course in place for you in case you can't find a suitable place to train.
Acomitl: Feel free to train here whenever you like.
Acomitl: Hopefully, we'll both be free people the next time we meet.
Traveler: I hope you didn't spend too much money on it.
Traveler: You're welcome.

## Talk 9

Acomitl: What a pity, you almost had it.
Acomitl: You can do it! Don't give up!
Traveler: How come you're so enthusiastic all of a sudden?
Acomitl: Well, my freedom depends on you, after all!
Acomitl: Alright, let's take a short break, then we'll try again. I know you can do it this time.
Acomitl: Don't worry, I won't give up on you. No matter how many tries it takes, don't lose heart. I know you can do it!
Traveler: Please, just give up on me already!
Acomitl: No, that's something I'll never, ever do. There's no hope for me, but there is for you.
Acomitl: If even you can't help me, then I'll really be at a dead end.
Traveler: I need a break.
Acomitl: Of course, get some rest. We'll continue later!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Sleepy Qucusaurus: Need something? If not, please don't disturb me, I'm trying to get some sleep.
Traveler: Fancy some Grainfruit?
Sleepy Qucusaurus: Eh!? C'mon, gimme gimme!
Sleepy Qucusaurus: #Now that's the taste I'm talking about! Thanks, bro!
Traveler: Do you know the path to the cellar?
Sleepy Qucusaurus: Well, why didn't you ask before? Come this way, I'll just get rid of this haystack for you.
Traveler: No worries, sleep tight.
Sleepy Qucusaurus: Sleepy time... If you need something, go ask another Saurian.

### Additional Talk 2

Melancholic Qucusaurus: How can Acomitl get enough to eat when he's hiding in the cellar? His jaw looks so gaunt right now...
Traveler: Do you know the path to the cellar?
Melancholic Qucusaurus: Acomitl's resting in the cellar. He's not accepting guests right now.
Traveler: We brought food for Acomitl.
Melancholic Qucusaurus: Oh, you're so thoughtful. Why didn't I think of that? Even if I had to force it down his throat...
Melancholic Qucusaurus: *sigh* I haven't done a good job of taking care of him after Xueyoni left him with me! Such a bad Saurian!
Melancholic Qucusaurus: I'll leave it to you then. Remember, from the spot where hot steam is rising from the cliff's edge, fly down and you'll see a small slope. Then, strike the cliff wall three times, in this order: "Booong... Booong, booong, booong... Booong, booong..."
Melancholic Qucusaurus: Don't get it wrong, or you won't be let in.
Traveler: We brought drinks for Acomitl.

### Additional Talk 3

Sleepy Qucusaurus: S—Sleepy...

### Additional Talk 4

Melancholic Qucusaurus: So worrying... What should I do about Acomitl?

### Additional Talk 5

Sleepy Qucusaurus: *cough* *cough* There's a Grainfruit stuck in my... *cough* throat...

### Additional Talk 6

Melancholic Qucusaurus: Taking care of humans is so tiring. Dear oh dear...

### Additional Talk 7

Look Down (Cellar): Don't waste your energy. Even if I told you that there were two paths from the camp to the cellar, *only Saurians know where they are*, so it wouldn't do you any good. You might as well just leave now.
Look Down (Cellar): (The rustling stops, and it goes quiet.)
