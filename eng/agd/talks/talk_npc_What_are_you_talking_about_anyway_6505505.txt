# Talk Dialog

Traveler: What are you talking about, anyway?
Gontharet: Fontaine, of course, Fontaine! The Palais Mermonia, our energy situation, our top-down system... We have so many problems here. Can't you see?
Gontharet: I've spoken to Arouet about them many times, and he agrees with my points â€” why, he's even treated me to coffee several times!
Gontharet: It's just that... Well, that hasn't worked as well recently. He says that my opinions don't attract him the way they used to.
