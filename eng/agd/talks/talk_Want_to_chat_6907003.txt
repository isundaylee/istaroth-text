# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Want to chat?
Nilou: Sure, I'd be happy to. What do you want to chat about?
Traveler: I'd like to hear your latest thoughts...
Nilou: Huh? Mine?
Nilou: I've been wondering which came first: the audience or the performance?
Nilou: I'd probably have to sift through a whole bunch of documents and stuff if I really wanted to get that answer, but I'm no good at things like that.
Nilou: Hee-hee, so it's just a random thought...
Nilou: Oh no, we were supposed to chat together, but I've been doing all the talking...
Nilou: Alright, the ball's back to you â€” catch! I want to hear about your experiences and the people you've met.
Nilou: Tell me all about them! I'm all ears!
Traveler: About everyone at the Grand Bazaar...
Nilou: Oh, I just love the atmosphere. It feels like one big, happy family.
Nilou: Everyone has different personalities, so there are some small squabbles here and there...
Nilou: But if anyone runs into a problem, everyone else will help out however they can.
Nilou: Isn't that what family's like?
Nilou: They bicker and fight, but they'll always be your biggest supporters.
