# Like Rhyme and Song, the Summer Reverie


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hey, look! Isn't that the same guy we saw on our first day here?
Persikov: Ahaha... *hic* Everyone's gone crazy. Everyone should get out of here!
Persikov: We'll... We'll never wake up... But I was right, my precious, you are invincible... hehe...
Xinyan: Precious? What's his precious?
Persikov: A miracle machine... Definitely not... impossible... *hic*!
Mona: I think he's referring to that machine.
Fischl: What a drunkard, hmph.
Oz: Oh goodness, the smell of alcohol... Mein Fräulein, please allow me to fan the fumes away with my wings.
Mona: Excellent, please fan them away for me, too.
Traveler: Me as well.
Oz: Certainly.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I've checked the surroundings, but there's no one else here.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Isn't that strange? The Fatui is a big organization, but he is the only one left at this camp. What's more, we didn't even see him the last time we were here.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Even the larger gentleman from the first time is missing. I think... they must be hiding somewhere.
Kaedehara Kazuha: As for why they may be hiding, I'm afraid we'll have to ask him.
Paimon: But he's as drunk as Tone-Deaf Bard... Should we wait for him to sober up?
Fischl: Cleanse him with the holy spring of punishment!
Oz: Mein Fräulein means to splash him with water.
Paimon: Sounds like a good idea. Let's try!
Black Screen Text: Everyone takes out their water bottles and empties them over the collapsed Fatui researcher...
Paimon: Hey, he opened his eyes!
Persikov: Hm... Huh?
Mona: Hey, are you one of the Fatui? Can you tell us what happened here and what that machine is for?
Persikov: ...F—Fatui...
Persikov: ...Hah! Fatui!
Persikov: Oh... those blockheads from the administration will regret it now! Haha! That's what you get for rejecting my research and forcing me to...
Persikov: Forcing me to... to conduct my research on this deserted island... My precious! My precious... *sobs*
Paimon: Why is he crying? Looks like he has a lot of pent-up emotions...
Persikov: ...You mocked me... and my precious invention! You... you don't know anything about the future.
Persikov: Only my invention... can help us conquer the world! Haha... hahaha...
Persikov: Idiots, such idiots, hahaha...
Persikov: Ow! Don't hit me! I won't blow up the lab again... I'm sorry! I didn't mean to...
Xinyan: This man's gone insane. There's no way we can communicate with him.
Kaedehara Kazuha: He wasn't like this when we first met him. It looks like the effects have grown worse, to the point of driving him mad.
Persikov: *sobs*... My manuscript, my manuscript! Only that... can save... save... *sobs*
Fischl: Manuscript? Where is it?
Persikov: Don't yell at me, don't yell at me... *sobs*
Paimon: Fischl, don't yell at him!
Fischl: Hmph! Then I'll...
Mona: Let me try.
Mona: Kind sir, look at me. Now tell me, where did you hide your manuscript?
Persikov: *sobs* No, no, don't force me to write a report... *sobs* Go away...
Paimon: Ugh, he's completely lost in his own imagination...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Allow me.
Kaedehara Kazuha: ...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Please excuse me!
Black Screen Text: Kazuha stands quietly for a while, then throws the researcher over his shoulder and onto the ground.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Haah!
Persikov: *sobs* Ow! My butt... *sobs* My brain is finally starting to work again... It's not a mushy mess anymore...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Can you tell me where you put the manuscript?
Persikov: The manuscript... the manuscript... is in the crack over there...
Xinyan: Whew, finally! Otherwise, I was gonna have to blast some of my loudest rock 'n' roll in his ears.
Paimon: Kazuha hesitated for a long time before making a move. He's so nice.
Traveler: Yup. He's destined for greatness.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Everyone, let's search the stone cracks nearby for the manuscript.

## Talk 2

Fischl: Found it!
Oz: Congratulations! We've found the key to solving the problem!
Mona: Let me see... Hmm...
Black Screen Text: Mona takes the manuscript and studies it carefully...
Mona: Just as I thought. This machinery named "Cognitive Mimicry" is capable of altering the state of people's brains. It was invented by the researcher we met earlier, his name is Persikov.
Mona: According to the manuscript, the Fatui officials did not support Persikov's research. They believed he had taken the wrong path.
Mona: But Persikov insisted on putting his machine to use. In order to achieve that, he disassembled the machine and used his connections to transport the parts to this deserted island.
Paimon: How did they find this island? The Fatui's intelligence network's not to be underestimated.
Mona: Persikov was dead set on carrying out his experiments on this island. Most of his subjects were junior Fatui soldiers who all signed a waiver before the experiment.
Mona: ...It looks like they really thought this machine would benefit the Fatui.
Kaedehara Kazuha: How does the machine work?
Mona: That's most likely top-secret. The manuscript didn't reveal any details, but Persikov did mention that the machine was modeled after the power of a god.
Mona: Does that mean... there's a god connected to these dream-like mirages, and the Fatui found a way to research it?
Fischl: Clearly. Otherwise, they wouldn't have been able to reproduce the god's power.
Traveler: (Wait, so there's some sort of... Mirage Archon?)
Mona: Anyway, Persikov's experiment did not go as planned. The machine broke down just days after it was activated. They tried to fix it, but...
Mona: The technologically illiterate Fatui soldiers completely ruined the machine. Even its most important component of all — the crystalline cores — got ejected and disappeared.
Oz: A testament to the importance of maintenance in all aspects of life. I believe we can all learn something from this.
Mona: Persikov may be a mad scientist, but he didn't want to see his subordinates suffer. Besides, if he didn't solve the problem, he would end up going insane as well.
Mona: As a last resort, Persikov went out on his own to look for the cores. But he was just a sickly researcher unfit for the task. He had to give up.
Mona: Then, Persikov went searching for the soldiers who had gone mad and strayed from the group, and took them to a hidden cave.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I think that was where they were at the day we arrived on this island. Persikov was taking a strong Fatui soldier somewhere.
Mona: Yes. It took Persikov all of his strength to get all the missing soldiers into the cave. He tried to snap them out of it with music and poetry...
Mona: But nothing worked.
Xinyan: We came here once but there was no one around. Come to think of it, that must've been the day Persikov was busy gathering the soldiers into the cave.
Mona: There's good news and bad news written on the last few pages.
Mona: The good news is, Persikov managed to figure out the location of the crystalline cores by piecing together the snippets of information he could get from the delirious soldiers...
Mona: The bad news is, Persikov failed to revive them, and eventually succumbed to the device's influence himself. The last few pages of the manuscript are just unintelligible drunken scribbles.
Fischl: It appears that the responsibility for this issue now falls to my retainers and I.
Traveler: Never thought we'd be saving the day on a vacation...
Mona: There's a map in the manuscript. The markings should indicate the locations of the crystalline cores.
Paimon: We've got no choice but to find the crystalline cores now!
Traveler: I feel a sense of purpose.

## Talk 3

Traveler: (The researcher came to his senses briefly after Kazuha's throw, but soon fell unconscious...)
Traveler: (Did his mental state deteriorate, or did Kazuha knock him out...?)

## Talk 4

Paimon: We've inserted all the crystalline cores. Mona, is that all we needed to do?
Mona: I think so. That's what the manuscript says anyway.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Let's give it some time. Hopefully, it'll return to normal.
Black Screen Text: Everyone sits around the campfire, chatting and cooking barbecue.
Black Screen Text: Once the machine is fixed, the situation seems to improve. Soon, you hear footsteps approaching...
Fatui Sergeant: Aah! Someone's in our camp!
Fatui Recruit: Hey, who are you people!?
Fatui Sergeant: Hold on, look at the machine... is it fixed?
Fatui Recruit: What? But Mr. Persikov is still lying on the ground over there.
Paimon: We're the ones who fixed the device. Yeah, you're welcome!
Mona: We could have had a nice, relaxing vacation, if all of this hadn't ended up occupying so much of our time.
Fischl: Hmph! Apologize to me and my retainers at once!
Fatui Sergeant: Huh!? Oh no, oh no, I—I'm outta here...
Fatui Recruit: Hey, hey! Don't leave me here on my own... Mr. Persikov's still there, we need to save him!
Xinyan: Haha, those two definitely seem a little more lucid now.
Kaedehara Kazuha: It looks like we succeeded.
Paimon: Yay! Let's get outta here then. Paimon wants to spend the rest of this vacation back at our own camp.
Traveler: You mean Klee's camp.
Paimon: Yeah! But it feels like our camp now, kinda like our temporary home, hehe.
Oz: Then perhaps we should call it the Embassy of the Immernachtreich and Dodoland.
Paimon: Huh? No! That's too many words. Paimon would prefer something easy to remember.
Paimon: Come on, let's go home now.

## Talk 5

Paimon: *yawn* Whew! After coming home to a nice big meal then having a long lie down, Paimon's finally starting to feel relaxed.
Fischl: Hehe, is the hospitality of the Immernachtreich to thy liking?
Paimon: Paimon's loving it!
Oz: Wonderful. Mein Fräulein invited you all here not only to witness the arrival of our Holy Land, but most importantly, she wished that you could all relax and enjoy the summer.
Xinyan: Great! Well, I've come to the right place — I love it here!
Fischl: May this place become an eternal paradise.
Oz: Mein Fräulein says she hopes to go on more adventures with you here in the future.
Xinyan: Of course! And you should come find me in Liyue when you get the time. I'll show you around.
Xinyan: Oh, also, my friend runs the best restaurant in Liyue. I'm sure you'll love it.
Xinyan: If you're into opera, you should go see Yun Jin. She's the nicest person, and she likes making friends with new and interesting people. I'm sure the two of you will have plenty to talk about with your shared passion for theatrics.
Fischl: Oh? If Lady Xinyan speaks so highly of it, then I must entertain the idea.
Kaedehara Kazuha: #{NICKNAME}, I have a suggestion.
Kaedehara Kazuha: There is a snack called Roasted Lavender Melon in Inazuma, which goes rather well with fish. Why don't we roast some fruit and seafood for dinner tonight?
Traveler: Okie dokie!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Then it's decided. I'll go gather some more fruit. And for seasoning... Yup, that should do it.
Mona: Ah, you're all here.
Mona: I've noticed an issue. Although we've fixed the machine, as you can see — the mirages on the islands have still not disappeared.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I've noticed that, too. But considering it took some time for the mirages to appear, it may also take some time for them to disappear.
Mona: Yes, that's definitely possible.
Mona: In other news, my scryglass seems to be working fine now. The divination results are also looking about right, although...
Traveler: Although what?
Mona: Although there are some parts in the results that I don't quite understand... it's as if there is some sort of power surrounding us, and it's still watching us.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Do you think it's caused by the machine, or perhaps Persikov?
Mona: Sorry, I'm also not sure. All I know is that the power is not hostile at the moment. Whatever it is, it doesn't seem to harbor any ill will toward us.
Traveler: (That reminds me, there's one unanswered question on these islands. But the group is unaware.)
Traveler: I'll keep that in mind.
Mona: Well, although there's nothing left to disturb us, and we can finally kick back and enjoy our vacation, we still ought to be cautious while we're on these islands.
Mona: I will keep seeing what the stars say every day.
Kaedehara Kazuha: I promised Fischl that I'd be her guard. I can help.
Mona: Good, I'll be counting on you.
Mona: ...*sigh* Goodness knows why those girls are so carefree about everything. I suppose it falls to me to be extra vigilant.
Traveler: Paimon, come with me!
Paimon: Oh, coming!
Traveler: Let's go over there.
Paimon: Ohh, so we're gonna call the Tone-Deaf Bard, right?
Dodocommunication Device: Dodoco! Dodoco!
Venti: Well hello there, strangers! You finally called! I thought you were having so much fun that you'd completely forgotten about me.
Paimon: Nope! Tone-Deaf Bard, a whole bunch of really strange things happened!
Black Screen Text: You tell Venti everything that has happened on the islands over the past few days...
Venti: A strange machine that can imitate the power of a God? Wow, haha, I didn't know the Fatui had plans like that. Their imaginations are truly running wild.
Paimon: So judging from your tone, it sounds like you don't know any more about this than we do?
Venti: Alas, I am but a humble bard who sings for his Mora in the tavern. Why would I know anything about it?
Paimon: Ugh, so annoying...
Venti: But, other than that, did you two have fun?
Paimon: We did! We ate a lot of yummy food and saw loads of amazing things. It was really cool!
Traveler: It was a great experience.
Venti: Hehe, that's good.
Venti: The point of traveling is to record any feelings stirred along the way. As long as you had an unforgettable experience, this journey has served its purpose.
Venti: As for the mysterious voice, although we don't know who it was, not only did she not harm you, she also helped you to gain a better understanding of each other, right?
Venti: If you look at it that way, maybe she meant you well. I mean, if she was able to intercept Alice's communication tool, I'm sure she's also plenty capable of attacking you.
Paimon: Hmm, Tone-Deaf Bard is right...
Traveler: ...
Traveler: I understand.
Venti: Hahaha, I'm glad to bring you some peace of mind. Just enjoy your vacation to the fullest, and don't forget to tell me all about the marvelous mirages when you get back.
Venti: I want to record all these beautiful memories, and turn them into ballads. Every summer will become an unforgettable song.
Traveler: It's a deal.
Venti: #Then I'll just wait for your return, {NICKNAME}. Happy vacationing!
Paimon: If Tone-Deaf Bard thinks it's okay, then maybe there's nothing to worry about.
Paimon: After all, Tone-Deaf Bard is still a god. We should probably trust him.
Traveler: Indeed.
Paimon: Let's head back, we don't wanna keep everyone waiting.
Paimon: Hold on, didn't Fischl say earlier that she's going to catch some crabs? Paimon wants to go too!
???: Now you have solved the mystery... doesn't it make you feel happy, satisfied?
Traveler: (That voice...!)
???: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. I'm just a little bird that sometimes flies by these islands, and am now watching you from far, far away.
???: I just so happened to sense a power here that has something to do with me. I was curious, so I landed on the beach to quietly watch everything that took place on these islands.
???: ...It was fascinating. The ones who came here to work were so busy, and yet I still saw genuine smiles on their faces from time to time.
???: And then all of you arrived later on, bringing your glorious dreamscapes and wonderful willpower.
???: Your dreams are like the pure and delicate bubbles floating on the water. The more beautiful the illusion, the more it fascinates me.
???: I'm not able to travel myself, but I do admire free spirits like yourself. So I helped them design a little something for you all. I hope you liked it.
Traveler: Who are you?
???: As I said, I don't have an agenda. I'm just a little bird. I stopped here to admire your lives — joys, sorrows, and all.
???: You are a special person, with a unique and brilliant glow. I decided to communicate with you in this way because I'm really curious about you.
???: There is no need to wonder about my name. Maybe one day in the future, we will meet in another place.
???: When that time comes, I think you'll be able to recognize me. Hehe.
Traveler: (The voice has faded... Was she directly speaking into my mind?)
Paimon: Hey, what are you doing? The crabs don't catch themselves!
Traveler: (...What did she mean...)
Traveler: ("Meet in another place"... But when, and where?)
Traveler: Meh, maybe.
Traveler: Overall, I'd say it was pretty satisfying.
Traveler: Roasted Lavender Melon sounds great. I've tried it before!
Kaedehara Kazuha: Oh? Did you try it in Inazuma?
Traveler: A few Inazuman friends made some for me.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Haha, that's great.
Kaedehara Kazuha: You know, I want to follow your example and travel around the world. Hopefully, I can also make good friends along the way.
Traveler: Knowing you, that shouldn't be a problem.
Kaedehara Kazuha: #That means a lot coming from you, {NICKNAME}.
