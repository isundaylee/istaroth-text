Paimon: Wow, the two of them seem to be still working out the details of beetle fighting, preparing for the next game... They don't even know we're here.
Paimon: #So, Traveler? Why don't we just leave them to it?
Traveler: Let's watch them fight!
Traveler: You're right. Let's go quietly.

Grandmaster Hanakado: Oh, you're still here? Looks like your passion for beetle fighting has fully blossomed...
Traveler: About your beetle fight with Itto...
Grandmaster Hanakado: Haha, you guys pick up fast! Let me give you a recap of the highlights of all the fights I've had with the Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King...
Traveler: Didn't you leave?
Paimon: Oh right, didn't you and Bull-Chucker... Ahem! Didn't you and Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King continue the battle on your home ground?
Paimon: How did you sneak back here alone? Did he finally best you?
Grandmaster Hanakado: Aha! Did you think it was that easy to beat me?
Grandmaster Hanakado: When I arrived, Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King had met my grandfather and took a keen interest in how he took care of his Onikabuto.
Grandmaster Hanakado: He was chatting eagerly with my grandfather, discussing the beetles' diet and training grounds, and it looked like the conversation was going to take quite a while.
Grandmaster Hanakado: Letting Bona-Fide Beetle Battle King and his Crimson Staff take a break helps to make our next battle a fair fight, so I came back here to take a look.
Paimon: Well... Paimon kind of gets it. The place you mentioned is your home, and your awesome Onikabutoâ€” they're all taken care of by your grandfather, so they're big and strong, right?
Grandmaster Hanakado: Yeah, that's about it! But there's more to my game than that, like a little secret that affects the habits of the beetles...
Grandmaster Hanakado: Come and have a look if you have the chance!
Paimon: A secret, huh? Now Paimon really wants to know what it's all about! Paimon promises to drop by next time!
Traveler: Until next we meet!
Grandmaster Hanakado: We'll meet again, Oni King's Right Hand and Skycleaving White-Iron Lavender Melon!
