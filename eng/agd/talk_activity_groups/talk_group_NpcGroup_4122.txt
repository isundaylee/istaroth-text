Mahshid: Next time someone wants to trade shifts with you, don't agree to it!
Matari: Yes, ma'am.
Mahshid: You Eremites are too used to idling in the desert to know the importance of rules!
Mahshid: If everyone switched shifts at will and didn't follow schedule, it would turn into a big mess!
Matari: Yes, you are right.
Mahshid: Even though you're a mercenary hired by the Akademiya, your job of keeping law and order on the docks is as crucial as the researchers', got it?
Matari: Yes, I got it.

Mahshid: Say, if I wasn't such a bookworm, would I... *burp* be more popular in school?
Matari: Yeah, perhaps.
Mahshid: Say, if I was as *burp* agreeable as you, I probably would be on better terms with everybody...
Matari: Yeah, probably.
Mahshid: Say, if I was less blunt... *burp*, I might've been promoted by now...
Matari: Yeah, very likely.
Mahshid: Say, am I unworthy of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's legacy by being so mediocre?
Matari: Yeah... Wait, no.
Matari: Don't say that. You're doing a very important job right now.
Mahshid: R—Really...? *burp*
