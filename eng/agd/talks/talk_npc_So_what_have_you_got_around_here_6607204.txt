Traveler: So, what have you got around here?
Wakea Nui: Travelers from distant lands can first have a taste of the local cuisine, before enjoying a live music performance and checking out the exquisitely-made records.
Wakea Nui: Once you've recovered from that, you can try out all the water sports we have to offer, and have a jolly good time.
Wakea Nui: If your arms and legs are sore, just have a good soak in the hot springs, and you'll be back up in no time.
Wakea Nui: Come evening, visit the Golden Dusk to watch the sunset and have a nice, iced drink, and that'll be the perfect way to wrap up your day.
