# Chasing Shadows


## Talk 1

Fatui Guard: No, NO! Don't eat me! Ah? You're... You're human?
Fatui Guard: The entire floor's defenses... have been broken. I thought it was the Abyss Order attacking...
Traveler: We have come for the Holy Lyre der Himmel.
Fatui Guard: H—How did you guys know the lyre's here?
Fatui Guard: The place it's being kept is locked up tight. If you're after the key, keep going further into the ruins, but d—don't come after me!
Fatui Guard: I don't know which one of the guards has it, but I'm sure you can find the guards and find out for yourselves.
Paimon: This guy looks like he's about to wet himself...
Fatui Guard: Y—You just worry about yourselves!
Fatui Guard: One of the Harbingers is already in Mondstadt.
Fatui Guard: Signora. When she gets her hands on you she's going to string you up and torture you. When that time comes, don't you dare say a word about me.
Traveler: We have come for your life.
Fatui Guard: Ahh, Ah, Ah!
Fatui Guard: No, don't! I have valuable information! I'll tell you!
Fatui Guard: We hid the Holy Lyre in the depths of these ruins.

## Talk 3

Traveler: Give up. No one's coming to rescue you.
Timid Guard: Did you already beat all the other guards?

## Talk 4

Traveler: Enough talk. Stick 'em up!
Timid Guard: Ahh!? You're just going to attack me!?

## Talk 5

Timid Guard: Ah...

## Talk 6

Timid Guard: Fine. Not like I have a choice anyway.
Timid Guard: Alright. You're free to go.
Timid Guard: But I don't have the key unfortunately. You'll have to ask the next guard you come across.

## Talk 7

Timid Guard: Hehe...
Timid Guard: I've had enough!
Timid Guard: I am a proud citizen of Snezhnaya! I will not falter!

## Talk 10

Greedy Guard: W-Who are you? How'd you get in here!?

## Talk 11

Traveler: We are goodwill ambassadors from the Snezhno-Mondstadtian Association.
Greedy Guard: Never heard of that association before...
Greedy Guard: What are you lot doing here?
Traveler: We wish to borrow the Holy Lyre der Himmel.
Greedy Guard: That lie's way too obvious. You really haven't got anything better?
Greedy Guard: And just how do you plan to "borrow" it?
Traveler: We are here to do goodwill... stuff.
Greedy Guard: Oh? Keep talking...
Greedy Guard: Hmm, you're here for the Lyre, aren't you?
Traveler: We are investigating you for alleged corruption.
Greedy Guard: What? How did you little brats creep in here? You take me for a fool?
Greedy Guard: Hmm, you're here for the Lyre, aren't you?

## Talk 12

Traveler: There's nothing to discuss. Give up now.
Greedy Guard: Ha... Like hell!

## Talk 13

Greedy Guard: Wow...

## Talk 14

Greedy Guard: Okay...
Greedy Guard: Okay. Sounds like a plan.
Greedy Guard: Alright. You're free to go.
Greedy Guard: But I don't have the key unfortunately. You'll have to ask the next guard you come across.

## Talk 15

Greedy Guard: Hehe...
Greedy Guard: Think you can look down your nose at me, huh?
Greedy Guard: The will of Snezhnaya is as solid as the permafrost! I will not yield!

## Talk 16

Greedy Guard: The will of Snezhnaya is as solid as the permafrost! I will not yield!

## Talk 17

Paimon: Finally, the lyre is back in safe hands!
Paimon: Where did that guy go, though? He was here a second ago...
Paimon: Signora is going to end you. The songs bards sing of your demise will be so terrifying — the people of Mondstadt will never sleep again for the nightmares they give them.
Paimon: Big talk for a guy who still ran off in the end... Chicken.

## Talk 18

Greedy Guard: Okay...
Greedy Guard: Okay. Sounds like a plan.
Greedy Guard: I have the key here. You can head in from the hall outside, but don't tell anyone that it was me who gave you the key.
