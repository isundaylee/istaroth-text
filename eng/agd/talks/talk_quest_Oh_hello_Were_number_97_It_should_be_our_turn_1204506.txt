Paimon: Oh, hello! We're number 97. It should be our turn now, right?
Kanai: Uhhh... Yeah, sorry, the clinic's closed for the day.
Paimon: What? Why?
Kanai: Because Emura Ichigensai doesn't have limitless energy, that's why. He's gone home to rest. You'll have to try again tomorrow.
Paimon: But we've been waiting sooooo long!
Kanai: Not as long as some people. Try getting here earlier next time.
Traveler: Do you know where he lives, by any chance?
Kanai: Hah, save yourself the trouble. Spiritual masters like Emura Ichigensai cultivate their powers with peace and solitude. Someone like you ain't gonna find him.
Paimon: Drat. We shoulda barged in after all...
Traveler: Let's report back to Mizuki for now.
Paimon: Yeah, nothing else we can do for today.
