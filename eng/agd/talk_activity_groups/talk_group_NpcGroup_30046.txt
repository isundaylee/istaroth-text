Lizzie: Hey there! Have you tried any of the events that I recommended?
Traveler: They're not bad.
Lizzie: Hahaha, you might as well try a brand-new event that I'm promoting now — "Floral Freefall"!
Lizzie: This event is really thrilling! If you're into adventuring, it's sure to be something right up your alley!
Lizzie: Jump down from way up high and float through the air, screaming at the top of your lungs — YAHOO~!
Traveler: Sounds like something I'd enjoy.
Lizzie: Haha, if it weren't for my duties as a hostess, I'd be on my merry way there.
Lizzie: Just like before, if your score is high enough, you can claim a reward.
Traveler: I'll have a look.
Lizzie: Sure, go try it out! When our future events begin, I will introduce them to you as well.
Lizzie: Have fun!
Traveler: Excuse me then.
Traveler: Seems that you'd be more into that than me.
Traveler: They're not as fun as I imagined.
Traveler: I'll check them out in a moment...
