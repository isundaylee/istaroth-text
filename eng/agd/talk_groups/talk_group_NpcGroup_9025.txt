Traveler: How do you like it here?
Xingqiu: Even if it were to exist solely upon the page, this teapot realm would not fail to inspire.
Xingqiu: And yet here I am, perceiving it with my own senses.
Xingqiu: Naturally... I couldn't be happier.
Xingqiu: Not to mention...
Traveler: Yes...?
Xingqiu: Well... I can read at my leisure here, for hours on end, without any fear of interruption. Ahh... the perfect getaway...
Traveler: What about fighting against injustice?
Xingqiu: Shh! Not so loud...
Xingqiu: I wouldn't dream of neglecting any of that!
Xingqiu: But please... Don't let anyone else hear you talking about it...

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Xingqiu: But of course! It's always a pleasure to talk with you.
Xingqiu: Tell me, what have you been doing recently?
Traveler: Oh, y'know... escorting cargo, punishing disciples of evil...
Xingqiu: Magnificent! Acts of pure chivalry by the sound of it.
Xingqiu: *sigh* Oh, how I would love to take up the sword with you... pursuing justice throughout the land!
Traveler: But your hands are tied, right?
Xingqiu: Never mind, haha. I just had the best idea...
Xingqiu: Why don't we have ourselves a little contest? First to a hundred chivalrous acts wins!
Xingqiu: There are no restrictions on the nature of the act or the beneficiary. But you need to keep a tally. Once the act is completed, it should be verified by the other party.
Traveler: I'm feeling pretty confident.
Xingqiu: Hehehe...
Xingqiu: Oh, hehe — uh... don't mind me.
Xingqiu: Just... Don't expect to win too easily.
Traveler: I would be only too honored to have you join me.
Xingqiu: Hehe... A pity that it will have to wait until some point in the future. But if we're talking about the here and now... Ooh! I got it...
Traveler: Driving monsters away, rescuing people from certain death... the usual.
