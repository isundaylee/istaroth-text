Traveler: Tell us about your relationship to this castle...
Osse: You've guessed it already, I reckon. In the past, when I could still change my form freely, he... and I, and many of our companions dwelled here.
Osse: In those days, a new nation had just been born, and as far as we were concerned, the possibilities were yet endless.
Osse: Here, we organized the classics, researching music theory and magic, in the hopes that we might tame this perilous power and use it to open up a brighter age.
Osse: But... These possibilities would quickly become lost to us, and I alone remained...
Traveler: Osse...
Osse: It's fine. These things happened a long time ago.
