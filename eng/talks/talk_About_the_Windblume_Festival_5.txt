Traveler: About the Windblume Festival...
Lawrence: When we speak of the Windblume Festival, the topic of the Windblume's legend is an inevitable one.
Lawrence: The Windblume Festival has its origins in Old Mondstadt, and people all have their own opinions concerning the true identity of the Windblume.
Lawrence: At the moment, the two most popular must be the "Dandelionite" and "Asterist" schools of thought.
Lawrence: Of course, there are those who believe that neither of these is the true Windblume...
Traveler: About the Dandelionites...
Lawrence: Oh, they believe that the Dandelion is the Windblume. I believe that this is the most mainstream line of thinking.
Lawrence: The Dandelionites believe that the Windblume Festival is a festival for lovers and that they should express their love with the most extravagant sincerity during this time.
Lawrence: Passionate people in love will often travel to Cape Oath and express their feelings for one another amid the billowing Dandelions and profuse Cecilias...
Lawrence: It's all rather romantic, wouldn't you say?
Traveler: Then, about the Asterists...
Lawrence: Those who believe that the Windwheel Aster is the Windblume are certainly not few, but they are not as numerous as those who believe it is the Dandelion.
Lawrence: They believe that the liberation of Old Mondstadt from tyranny should be at the heart of the festival...
Lawrence: ...And that instead of celebrating love, this festival is more suited to remembrance.
Lawrence: If you think about it, this view does have its merits as well...
Lawrence: But it isn't the majority. I guess people just want to have a relaxing, good time during the festive season...
