# Yae Publishing House's Invitation


## Talk 1

Chang the Ninth: Hmm? Traveler? What brings you to my home today?
Traveler: Here's a letter and a gift from Yae Publishing House.
Chang the Ninth: A letter from Yae Publishing House? They're not asking me to change my pen name again, are they?
Chang the Ninth: I've told them a thousand times that I'll write under my real name...
Chang the Ninth: *sigh* Oh, forget it. Let me have a look...
Chang the Ninth: They want me to judge a novel-writing contest... Hmm. I don't think I have the time, but I suppose I should thank them, anyway...
Chang the Ninth: Eh? What's all this? These are... "creative suggestions"...
Chang the Ninth: Uh, I—I'll have to read these a bit more carefully. Thank you, Traveler.

## Talk 2

Xingqiu: Hmm, this part is indeed well-written, and the progression is so very novel...
Traveler: Xingqiu.
Xingqiu: Oh, so that's what happens. Fascinating...
Traveler: Xingqiu!
Xingqiu: #Hmm? Ah, it's you, {NICKNAME}. It has been a while.
Xingqiu: From the way you greeted me, you seem well. That is good... What brings you here today?
Paimon: Actually, we were hoping to ask you to find someone for us. You've read a ton of books, so you probably know.
Xingqiu: A person? Are you looking for a writer, then? Hmm... certainly, ask away.
Traveler: We're looking for a certain "Zhenyu"...
Xingqiu: Zhenyu? Wh—Where did you hear this name?
Traveler: It says so right here on this copy of "A Legend of Sword"...
Paimon: We're looking for this Zhenyu person because someone from Yae Publishing House in Inazuma asked us to pass them a letter.
Paimon: Would you know who this Zhenyu person is?
Xingqiu: Well, this Zhenyu of whom you speak...
Xingqiu: This is embarrassing, but... that's my pen name.
Paimon: Eh!?
Traveler: Well, that's one we've never heard of.
Xingqiu: Well, it's certainly nothing worth mentioning.
Xingqiu: Initially, the editor in charge of this book here in Liyue told me that "the setting is too outlandish while the plot is unexpectedly clichéd. No one will like this," and rejected my manuscript.
Xingqiu: I didn't feel like taking that lying down, so I had a few copies printed myself before planting them surreptitiously into Wanwen Bookhouse to see if anyone would like them.
Xingqiu: As it turned out, readers were few and far between, so I did not pay it any more mind. I never thought that it would become so popular in Inazuma.
Xingqiu: Still, I'm quite pleased that people are willing to read what I've written.
Xingqiu: I shall read this letter carefully, Traveler. Thank you.

## Talk 3

Aratani: Oh, you're back at last! How did it go? Did you find our two authors?
Traveler: I did. The letters have been delivered.
Aratani: That's wonderful! What did they say, Traveler?
Traveler: They both said that they'd read the letters with care.
Aratani: Good, good. *sigh* It's just a shame that they're both far away in Liyue. Even were things more normal, we couldn't easily go to visit them.
Aratani: Especially for Mr. Zhenyu. His book, "A Legend of Sword," wasn't even submitted by him, but by a traveling merchant.
Aratani: Later, one of our editors would read this book, and seeing its value, they prepared to go to Liyue personally and arrange for more manuscripts to be written.
Aratani: Who would've thought that with these changes in our situation, none of our letters that we sought to have people bring to Liyue ever returned.
Aratani: We could only publish the books first, while keeping a record of the royalties owed to Mr. Zhenyu. Once we'd established contact, we would send the royalties over.
Aratani: But it's been so long, and still "A Legend of Sword" remains a bestseller. The royalties are starting to pile up...
Aratani: *sigh* How I wish Mr. Zhenyu could attend this competition. These royalties can't be left to pile up like this much longer...

### Additional Talk 1

Aratani: Oh, you're back at last! How did it go? Did you find our two authors?
Traveler: I did. The letters have been delivered.
Aratani: That's wonderful! What did they say, Traveler?
Traveler: They both said that they'd read the letters with care.
Aratani: Good, good. *sigh* It's just a shame that they're both far away in Liyue. Even we couldn't easily go to visit them any day we like.
Aratani: This is especially the case for Mr. Zhenyu. His book, "A Legend of Sword," wasn't even submitted by him, but by a traveling merchant.
Aratani: Later, one of our editors would read this book, and seeing its value, they prepared to go to Liyue personally and arrange for more manuscripts to be written.
Aratani: But who would've thought... The situation here kept changing, one of our plans kept getting delayed, and none of the letters we had sent ever returned.
Aratani: We could only publish the books first, while keeping a record of the royalties owed to Mr. Zhenyu. Once we'd established contact, we would send the royalties over.
Aratani: *sigh* How I wish Mr. Zhenyu could attend this competition. These royalties can't be left to pile up like this much longer...

### Additional Talk 2

Aratani: *sigh* When will we be able to see Mr. Zhenyu's next work?

### Additional Talk 3

Chang the Ninth: How are there this many suggestions for future writing subjects...

### Additional Talk 4

Xingqiu: Still, I wonder — how did the book that I wrote manage to make it over the ocean to Inazuma?
Xingqiu: Did some passing Inazuman merchant buy the book before bringing it home with them?
