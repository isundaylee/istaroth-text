Araphala: Vasara Tree is so strong, how does the Vasoma Fruit it bears taste...

Traveler: About the Ashvattha...
Araphala: Bijas are only found on the strongest Vasara Tree that is able to be the Ashvattha. Bijas must be delicious.
Araphala: If a Nara has tried Bija, they will not want any other fruits because they've already tasted the very best of fruits in the forest.
