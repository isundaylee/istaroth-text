## Talk 1

Exhausted Iktomisaurus: Oh, my child... My child is locked up in there...
Exhausted Iktomisaurus: But my child is locked up in there. If I could just stage a rescue...
Traveler: The door has been opened...
Exhausted Iktomisaurus: Eh, it must've been the two outland visitors from earlier... Ah, thank goodness!
Exhausted Iktomisaurus: Right. I know what to do. Hmph, that lying liar who lies shall receive well-deserved punishment!
Exhausted Iktomisaurus: Hmph, just keep playing that game. That sneaky swindler is going to taste utter defeat this time!

## Talk 2

Mamull: Oh-ho, a foreign guest!
Mamull: I guess arriving at the right time is better than being early. I just set this stall up today, and here you are.
Mamull: What fantastic luck, hehe!
Traveler: You do have pretty good luck.
Mamull: Oh, no, no, dear guest. I'm not talking about my luck, but yours!
Paimon: Our luck?
Mamull: Indeed! Not everyone gets the chance to take the most ancient trial on the Hued-Jade Heights — the Painted Stone Challenge!
Mamull: This is a trial left behind by the legendary hero of the Masters of the Night-Wind, um... Vallejodaken, designed to train the memory of our tribespeople and their ability to perceive color.
Paimon: Wait, was there ever such a hero from the Masters of the Night-Wind...?
Mamull: Why, the tribe has a long and profound history. How could you outsiders hope to know all of it, eh?
Traveler: But you're not from the Masters of the Night-Wind, are you?
Mamull: ...W—Well now! What does a legendary hero's trial have to do with which tribe I'm from? The six major tribes were established so long ago, surely it is high time the barriers between them went down... *ahem*.
Mamull: Anyway, lucky travelers from afar — why don't you listen in on the rules of the Painted Stone Challenge? To be honest, the rewards I prepared are so generous it gives me conniptions!
Paimon: R—Really?
Paimon: #It still sounds fishy, but there's no harm in listening... What do you think, Traveler?
Traveler: You'll hear it no matter what I say...
Paimon: C'mon, a good adventurer should never pass up a chance for extra rewards!
Mamull: Then allow me, the heir of the hero Vallekan, to explain the rules to you...
Paimon: Wait, did that name just change, or...
Mamull: Change? No, no, it was always the same name. *sigh* You foreigners just have trouble remembering the mighty names of our ancient heroes — but that's okay. Anyway, here's how the rules work...
Mamull: When the challenge begins, the Iktomisaurus next to me will create differently-colored stones on the empty platform, which will disappear shortly...
Mamull: What you must do is use the *Hued Monetoo to grant color that corresponds* to the stones on each platform. As long as the colors match, you pass the stage.
Mamull: So, this is actually a memory game. How about it? Pretty simple, right?
Traveler: That doesn't sound very difficult...
Paimon: Plus, there's two of us, so it's just remembering a couple of colors...
Mamull: Yes, yes. Oh-ho, isn't today your lucky day? But it's also an unlucky day — for my wallet.
Mamull: So then, if you wish to play, it'll cost you 500 Mora to take part.
Paimon: What, you still want Mora for this?
Mamull: Ah, but what you don't know, dear guest, is that the trials of our heroes have been passed down through the generations and have required much expenditure to maintain... Such tremendous efforts are beyond the ken of outsiders.
Mamull: Besides, compared with the final reward, 500 Mora is a drop in the bucket. Ah, it's more like a barrier to entry, testing a challenger's sincerity in wanting to experience the trial...
Paimon: Okay okay, well...
Paimon: #Paimon's gonna fork up the fee, Traveler, but you gotta win!
Mamull: Okay then, you two: Shall we get things started?
Traveler: Well, let's see what you call "lucky" around here, then...
Paimon: Teehee, that word always fills Paimon with excitement!

## Talk 3

Exhausted Iktomisaurus: When are those two foreign guests going to realize that this whole thing is a scam...
Exhausted Iktomisaurus: *sigh*... It's happened so many times... *sigh* This hustler Mamull keeps using me to scam people...
Exhausted Iktomisaurus: But my child is locked up in there. If I could just stage a rescue...
Traveler: The door has been opened...
Exhausted Iktomisaurus: Really... When was that? Huh, was it when those two foreigners approached a while back...?
Exhausted Iktomisaurus: Right. I know what to do. Hmph, that lying liar who lies shall receive well-deserved punishment!
Exhausted Iktomisaurus: Hmph, just keep playing that game. That sneaky swindler is going to taste utter defeat this time!

## Talk 4

Traveler: I'm done!
Mamull: Okay, let's see about your results, shall we?

## Talk 5

Mamull: What a shame, dear guests, you almost got it...
Paimon: Wait, that can't be! Our answer was correct, Paimon's sure of it!
Mamull: Ah, well, doesn't everyone who gets it wrong think so too? That's normal, absolutely normal. The final test's difficulty is different from the others, though...
Mamull: "This is the final test, sure, but it looks easy enough..."
Mamull: Ask yourself this, my little flying guest: Did you not think this way, even if but once?
Paimon: Uh... Maybe...?
Mamull: And there's the rub! This is a hero's trial, mind you — there's no way I could let you breeze past it that easily.
Mamull: But that's fine. I'll let you try again for free!
Mamull: That way, you'll witness the final trial's true difficulty for yourself!
Paimon: Really? No need for any Mora this time around?
Paimon: S—Seeing as it's free, let's give it another go...
Traveler: "Free"'s the highest price of them all...
Paimon: That doesn't make sense either, but anyway... let's give this one more try!
Mamull: So then, your second try of the final trial. Shall we begin?
Traveler: Let's do this.
Mamull: Hehe. Well then, do be careful this time.
Traveler: Seeing as it's free...
Paimon: That's right! This try's free anyway!

## Talk 6

Mamull: How about it? Would you like to try the Painted Stone Challenge? Or would you like to learn more about the rules again?

## Talk 7

Traveler: I haven't finished coloring yet.
Mamull: Of course, but the longer you spend doing this, the more the color will seep out of your memory...

## Talk 8

Exhausted Iktomisaurus: When are those two foreign guests going to realize that this whole thing is a scam...
Exhausted Iktomisaurus: *sigh*... It's happened so many times... *sigh* This hustler Mamull keeps using me to scam people...
Exhausted Iktomisaurus: But my child is locked up in there. If I could just stage a rescue...

## Talk 9

Exhausted Iktomisaurus: Be careful... This fellow's a cunning one... *sigh*

## Talk 12

Trapped Iktomisaur Chick: Ohh... When can I get out of here...

## Talk 13

Mamull: Dammit, you bloody Iktomisaur, you... Don't you care about your own child anymore?
Exhausted Iktomisaurus (Iktomisaurus): Krraaa—!
Paimon: Hmph! We realized something was up, and we've already saved the little Iktomisaurus!
Traveler: So this trial's a scam...
Mamull: And here I thought that we had two fattened outlander sheep waltzing in, but no, you're just scoundrels, here to ruin everything!
Exhausted Iktomisaurus (Iktomisaurus): Krraaa—!
Mamull: Alright, alright! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Traveler: Give our Mora back!
Paimon: Yeah, it was 500 Mora each time... and you scammed Paimon so many times!
Mamull: Alright, alright! Here, you two... take it. This... This should be enough, right?
Exhausted Iktomisaurus (Iktomisaurus): Krraaa—!
Mamull: Uh... Mister... or Miss... Saurian...? L—Let's talk this through, shall we?
Mamull: Look, I provided your child with a safe place, gave it food and water... Aren't you going to show even a little gratitude?
Paimon: Mouthing off at a time like this, huh?
Exhausted Iktomisaurus (Iktomisaurus): Rawr!
Mamull: N—No, pl—please!
Black Screen Text: The Iktomisaurus flaps its wings, sending frigid air swirling around the scammer who had trapped its child.
Soon, the swindler Mamull is forced to flee under the threat of razor-sharp Saurian claws...
Black Screen Text: After that, the Iktomisaurus bows in thanks before departing, youngling in tow.
Paimon: Hmph, this guy kept scamming Paimon for all that Mora, over and over again!
Paimon: Serves him right!

Mamull: Hmm, true, it is always important to understand the rules before you start doing anything. *sigh* Listen carefully, then. The "Painted Stone Challenge" goes like this:
Mamull: When the challenge begins, the Iktomisaurus next to me will create differently-colored stones on the empty platform, which will disappear shortly...
Mamull: What you must do is use the *Hued Monetoo to grant color that corresponds* to the stones on each platform. As long as the colors match, you pass the stage.
