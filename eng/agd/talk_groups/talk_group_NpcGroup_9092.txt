## Talk

Gaming: Hey buddy! Good to see you again.
Gaming: This place is dope! And so huge...

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Gaming: Are you kidding me? Isn't it obvious?
Gaming: Well, I dunno how you haven't noticed, but I totally love it here! I mean, you built this whole place from the ground up! How cool is that!?
Gaming: To get specific though, here's three reasons why I dig this place: It's fun, chill, and I can sleep with both eyes closed!
Traveler: So, in a word, it's dope?
Gaming: Hahaha! You got that from me, didn't you?
Gaming: Anyway, look — I wanna level with you. In my mind, there's a fine line between graciously accepting the hospitality of your host and being a leech.
Gaming: Now, I know you won't let me pay any rent while I'm here, 'cause we're friends and all, but I will at least insist on making myself useful. So, if you catch me cleaning or gardening at any point — don't try and stop me.
Traveler: I couldn't possibly make a guest do my chores...
Gaming: Knew you'd say that. But if all I am is a guest, does that mean you want me to treat this like a hotel?
Gaming: Or would you rather I made myself at home?
Traveler: Of course!
Gaming: Okay, so do you have any objection to me cleaning up after myself while I'm in my own home?
Gaming: I'll give you to the count of three to raise any objections — ready? Three! Okay, great, no objections! Glad that's settled.

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Gaming: Heck yeah! Always! And especially now, since you suggested it and everything.
Gaming: But before that — is your throat dry? Course it is, so's mine. Lemme make some tea real quick...
Traveler: You have a very entertaining way of talking!
Gaming: Huh? Oh, heh... Sorry, I bet half of what I say goes right over your head, huh?
Gaming: I must get it from my mom. She raised me, so all my habits come from her, including my turns of phrase.
Gaming: If I ever say something that you don't understand, or it goes down like a lead balloon, please stop me and demand that I explain what I mean in normal-person terms.
Gaming: Really, I insist — it's no trouble. Besides, hang out with me enough and I'm sure you'll be speaking fluent Gaming-ese before long!
Gaming: Ah, and if we're drinking tea, we're gonna need some nibbles!
Gaming: Luckily, I brought a sizeable stash of Winter Melon Cakes with me. Here's some for you... and here's a bunch for all your other guests...
Gaming: Wait! I almost forgot to count what's-her-face! Li'l Chubbikins, the one by the entrance.
Traveler: ..."Chubbikins"?
Gaming: Oh, sorry, I just mean she's round and chubby. Has she always lived here? It seems like it.
Traveler: Her name is Tubby. And yes, she was here even before me.
Gaming: Ahh, okay, Tubby, Tubby... My bad.
Gaming: Cool, cool... You seem to know all sorts of amazing people from all over the place.
Gaming: Makes sense though. Everyone adores you — you're smart, talented, and there isn't a bad bone in your body.
Gaming: What's that? Me too? Hahaha, if you say so!
Traveler: Gonna brew one of your signature herbal teas?
Gaming: Oh, uh... Sorry to disappoint. I'm afraid all I have with me is this Single-Origin Yauwan from my hometown...
Gaming: But, if you want, I can take a look around your garden and scrounge some infusable foliage and whatnot to put aside for drying.
Gaming: Then, in the future, I can make herbal teas on demand for you — Oh, and everyone else here.

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Gaming: You know, I haven't done a high-pole Wushou dance in aaages! I might go and gather some wood that I can sand down and use as Plum Blossom Poles.
Gaming: I should be able to find some in the area, but I wanna check first — do you have any Money Trees or Lucky Bamboo growing here?
Gaming: If so, I'll make a note of where they are so I can keep my distance. Wouldn't want to scratch one by mistake, that would ruin everything...
Traveler: What do Money Trees and Lucky Bamboo look like?
Gaming: You know, I'm not actually sure. I've delivered loads of them for business clients before, but they all seemed like different species.
Gaming: Dude, getting those things from where they grow in the mountains down into the city is a mammoth task. Not only is it a long journey, but they don't let you prune any of the branches off, and you have to water them according to a strict schedule...
Gaming: It's no joke. Fighting off ten bandits is an easier job than shifting one of those...
Gaming: Hehe, anyway, it's easy to poke fun at business people and their strange rituals when I don't know the first thing about business. But a client's a client, so I'll always respect their wishes down to the last detail.
Gaming: If they say it has to be watered at such-and-such a time of day on the dot, or left in the sun for exactly x minutes, then I'll do exactly as they say. No questions asked.
Traveler: Sounds like you know at least the first thing about doing business.
Gaming: Haha, that was a figure of speech and you know it. Being true to your word isn't a business skill, it's just the decent thing to do.
Gaming: It's basic respect to keep your promises to other people. But you know that, obviously — you always say what you mean and mean what you say. Your word is your bond.
Gaming: In any case, I gotta hold up my end of the deal to keep my job. I couldn't afford to do my Wushou dance without it.
Gaming: Anyway, will you join me to gather some wood for Plum Blossom Poles? I'll repay you in the form of a Wushou dance called "Auspicious Beast Versus Money Tree." Sound good?
Traveler: Why didn't you say so? Let's go, I wanna see that!
Traveler: Do you believe Money Trees can really make you rich?
Gaming: How would I know? Apparently they're so expensive, you'll bankrupt yourself buying one — I don't have the Mora to find out what happens after that!
Gaming: We actually have one at home though. My dad pays a visit to it first thing every morning.
Gaming: It hasn't made him rich so far, but I guess it does a good job of getting him to start each day fantasizing about being rich...? Uh, don't tell my dad I said that, or he'll be like, "Come here, son, I made a knuckle sandwich just for you!"

Traveler: Good morning, Gaming.
Gaming: Good morning to you too! I just finished my run, then practiced my horse stance and a few kicks.
Gaming: How's your day looking? I still got a few more moves to practice here, but do you wanna meet at the teahouse after I'm done?

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Gaming.
Gaming: Oh okay, night! You got enough blankets, yeah? Make sure you wrap up nice 'n' warm.
Gaming: If you can't get to sleep and need some company, lemme know! Whether there's stuff you wanna get off your mind, or you just wanna catch up on work, I'm down for hanging out.
Gaming: If you have a bad night, I'll make you an herbal tea tomorrow. No seriously, nighttime restlessness is all 'cause of heatiness, too.

## Talk

Gaming: Some of the greatest heroes come from the humblest of origins. I think that the same goes for good food too.
Gaming: There's an intimacy and charm to humble roadside stalls that no fancy restaurant could hope to replicate. Plus, you get to try food from a bunch of different chefs in the same place.
Gaming: The question is... Which place shall we start with? Any recommendations?

## Talk

Gaming: I've been burning the candle at both ends recently, with nighttime guard duty for some of my clients in between delivery jobs. We take turns, but it still means I rarely get to sleep the whole night.
Gaming: That's on top of the fact that getting proper rest on a delivery job is impossible. I doze a bit, but sitting up so that I'm ready to leap into action at the first sign that something's amiss...
Gaming: It's so nice to have a break from all that... *yawn* I'm so ready to switch off and get a good night's sleep.
