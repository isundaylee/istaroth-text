Aoi: Ah... Lovely. It seems you're quite the dab hand at making others' wishes come true.
Aoi: It's been almost twenty years since I last heard this tune. It was a boy in the neighborhood who played it for me.
Aoi: His wish was to travel and see the outside world... It's just a shame that I couldn't have been the one to help him.
Aoi: Heh, well, would you look at that? I've strayed from the topic. I'm afraid I can't help with this music festival. Tsukumomono Groceries can't do without me right now.
Aoi: Still, I'm glad to have heard this once more. Thank you so much.
