Hatim: Rather than eat up these predictions on futures from the experts at the Exchange, I might as well get myself a lucrative dish.

## Talk

Traveler: About the Exchange...
Hatim: Oh, the Kalimi Exchange. It's a place where you can see people's strengths, courage, and insights in action.
Hatim: If you have the assets and the wealth, as well as sound judgment, you can really turn a profit here.
Hatim: Sufficient wealth isn't a problem for a bona fide noble like myself. The Homayanis haven't got anything on my family!
Hatim: No, all I'm missing right now is an opportunity... to make my family fortune even more abundant. That way, my children can rest easy knowing that they won't have to go be merchants!

Traveler: See you.
Hatim: Good grief, not a single one of these amateurs is reliable!

Hatim: Everything is smoother with money!

## Talk

Traveler: And you are...
Hatim: I'm the descendant of the oldest aristocratic family in the desert, which is basically synonymous with wealth itself.
Hatim: It's too bad. Researchers who are not from Vahu{RUBY#[S]Aetiology}mana would never understand the value of this status. City folk these days...
Hatim: It's not merely a problem about Mora, but also wisdom and courage.
Hatim: Whether it's Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's legacy or King Deshret's relics, all can be found in my family's treasury.
Hatim: The estate left to me by my ancestors will continue to flourish in my hands.

Traveler: See you.
Hatim: See you.

Traveler: You are...
Hatim: I'm the descendant of the oldest clan of desert aristocrats. Our name is synonymous with wealth itself.
Hatim: It's just a huge shame that researchers who are not from Vahu{RUBY#[S]Aetiology}mana will never understand the value of that status. City folk these days...
Hatim: But it's not merely a problem about Mora, but also wisdom and courage.
Hatim: Whether it's the Dendro Archon's legacy or King Deshret's relics, all can be found in my family's treasury.
Hatim: The estate left to me by my ancestors will continue to flourish in my hands.

Traveler: You might go broke.
Hatim: Oh relax! With my considerable wealth, I'm sure I won't easily go broke.
Hatim: Even if it's just half of my wealth, it's still three times the worth of the Kalimi Exchange!
Hatim: See this antique? Ten a penny in my house. Take it if you want it!
