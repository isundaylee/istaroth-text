Jinghe: The gems here are pretty different from the ones we have in Liyue. Oh, and the vishaps too... Wait, they don't call them vishaps here, do they...

Traveler: Gems, you say?
Jinghe: Yeah. The rocks here are pretty special, aren't they?
Jinghe: I heard that Natlan's also got a tribe that's super gung-ho about mining, so I came all the way to check it out.
Jinghe: I figured I could bring some samples back, turn them over to the Liyue jewelers to see if they can be turned into some kind of new product.
Jinghe: But the minerals here are formed from a different process from those in Liyue. To put it simply, all Natlan ores are associated with a substance called "solid phlogiston."
Jinghe: Apparently, only the people here know how to manipulate phlogiston, but they are all loath to travel abroad, so I'm not sure if these samples will still be any good by the time I get back to Liyue...
Jinghe: I'll have to give this some more thought.

Traveler: Vishaps?
Jinghe: Oh, you can't call them Geovishaps. They're called "Tepetlisaurs."
Jinghe: You see this little one over here? The jeweler over there introduced him to me. His name is Nini. Cute, eh?
Jinghe: Natlan's a really cool place. Everyone here is super friendly, and even the Saurians here won't roll over and headbutt you just because you stepped into their territory. Maybe I'll consider extending my trip...
Jinghe: Still, I've heard that not all the Saurians here are friendly. I haven't met any other types of Saurians yet, so I'm looking forward to it.
