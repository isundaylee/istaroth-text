# Missing title (620257671)

Paimon: Eh? Did light just start flooding from that Statue of The Seven just now...?
Paimon: That's so weird! Did anything like this ever happen before?
Traveler: It's normal for a Statue of The Seven to glow.
Paimon: #Traveler, you didn't feel uncomfortable at all?
Traveler: Huh? Water... the water is speaking to me...
Paimon: Like Paimon's gonna believe you! If you can crack jokes like that, you must be fine.
Paimon: Though, after it lit up like that, the air does feel a lot more humid. Maybe it's because of all that Hydro energy that was released?
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon heard that in Fontaine, if you can use Elemental Energy properly, you can even swim underwater! Maybe you can even find sunken treasure!
Paimon: Paimon'll leave diving for treasure to you. Paimon will... stand on the shore and wait for you!
Traveler: It'll be lonely, going underwater alone...
Paimon: Waaah! But... but... being in the water is scary!
Paimon: What if Paimon accidentally gets swept in a current and gets all turned around and dizzy, and then she won't be able to fly away no matter what...
Paimon: Just like before Paimon met you, back in Mondstadt...
Traveler: Then I'll fish you out again!
Paimon: ...Really? Thâ€”Then maybe Paimon can try going underwater with you. Hmph! You'd better not go back on your word!
Traveler: You could try doing something for once, Paimon.
Traveler: Wow, I feel like I'm using gills to breathe...
Paimon: Good for you! First try growing a pair of gills and show Paimon! Hmph! Seems like you're feeling pretty good! Paimon can't believe Paimon was actually worried about you for a moment there...
Traveler: A rush of water?
Paimon: It certainly is the nation of the Hydro Archon! Even the Statues of The Seven are water fountains... YEAH RIGHT! That light wasn't normal at all!
