Traveler: YOU'RE SPEAKING TOO LOUDLY.
Wangjuan: What? Louder, please!
Wangjuan: We who live near the lower Yilong Wharf are bombarded by the sound of the waterfall every day, so our hearing tends to not be that sharp.
Wangjuan: Stay safe while checking out the waterfall, you hear?
Wangjuan: The huge difference in height and the violent waters can crush even the most sturdy battleships, let alone an ordinary human.
Wangjuan: Well, not that you feel ordinary in the slightest, but best not to take the risk anyway.
