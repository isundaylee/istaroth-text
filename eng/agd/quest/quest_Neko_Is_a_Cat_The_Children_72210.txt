# Neko Is a Cat: The Children


## Talk 1

Neko: Oh, meow, meow... Where did they go...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Neko: Ah, it's you. Some of those little rascals have run off, and I know not where they've gone. This is most worrying...
Neko: The outside is a very dangerous place. Though I have taught them a great many times, those stick-wielding hairy churls and those balls of water and fire are still perilous.
Neko: And if they were to run into the tingly, zappy place, the hair all over their bodies will stand on end. I would not see those little rascals experience something so terrible.
Neko: But there are always some who will not listen and go gallivanting about. I always have to expend much effort to bring them home...
Neko: A few of them ran off again today, which is most worrying indeed.
Neko: Please, I need your help to find Konbumaru and Hachihou.
Traveler: Who's Konbumaru...
Neko: A good child. This generation's Konbumaru is a smart one.
Traveler: "This generation," you say?
Neko: Hibiki would sometimes talk about it. I cannot claim to have understood, but from her expression when she spoke about Konbumaru, it must have been something good.
Neko: I name the little ones after good things. And once the little ones are little no more and depart, I will use those same names for ever younger cats.
Neko: Konbumaru loves to sleep in high places, so it would be best if you started there.
Traveler: Then, Hachihou is...
Neko: A very agile little fellow, and very fond of fish as well. As such, it will sometimes go to the seaside to look for fish that have washed up on the shore.
Neko: But it is very dangerous. Water is a most frightening thing. A long, long time ago, a certain... tanuki, was it? That fellow fell into the water, and nearly didn't come back.
Neko: You can probably find Hachihou by bodies of saltwater, looking for fish or crabs.
Traveler: That scope's too broad...
Neko: Really? It's a very high place and a body of saltwater.
Paimon: Uh, how about we show Neko our map...
Neko: You... You really do lack powers of comprehension, don't you? This is the very high place, and this is the saltwater body. They will surely be there.
Traveler: Leave it to us.
Neko: Then it is in your hands, meow, meow. Ah, these children...
Traveler: I'm no expert in catching cats...
Neko: Meow, meow. Fear not. Those little ones do not fear humans anyway... In fact, you might say that it is precisely because no one plays with them that they always run off by themselves.
Neko: Then it is in your hands, meow, meow. Ah, these children...

## Talk 2

"Hachihou": Meow, meow meow?
Paimon: Oh, so this must be "Hachihou"...
Traveler: Come here now, be good...
"Hachihou": Meow meow.
Paimon: Aw, what an obedient little kitty...
Traveler: Meow, meow...
"Hachihou": Meow... meow meow meow?

## Talk 3

"Konbumaru": Meow! Meow meow, meow!
Paimon: Whoa! That's a fierce little kitten alright. Be careful...
Traveler: Meow, meow...
"Konbumaru": Meow meow? Meow...
Paimon: Hehe, it sure looked fierce, but guess it's just gonna let you carry it after all, huh?
Traveler: I've come to take you home.
"Konbumaru": Meow! Meow... meow.

## Talk 4

Neko: Found those two children, have you?
Traveler: It's a work in progress...
Neko: Mm, is that so? Then make haste, lest those two run yet further than they already have.

## Talk 5

Neko: Have you found them?
Traveler: Yup.
Neko: You! You never have ears for me, do you? Why can't you both be as good as Meshi?
Traveler: Meshi...
Paimon: Hahaha, you really do name them after good things...
"Hachihou": Meow, meow meow meow... meow...
"Konbumaru": Meow! Meow meow!
Neko: No back-talk! Or should I not go and find you, and simply let you... let you go hungry from when the sun is up, to when the moon rises, to when the sun hangs high again, and leave you to find your way home?
"Konbumaru": Meow...
Neko: Hah, that's a good child. Alright, alright. It's just good that you have returned.
Neko: I owe you much. If not for your help, these little rascals would have gone hungry out in the wild.
Traveler: I actually think they would've made it back themselves...
Neko: Whatever the case, you have my thanks.
Neko: If you can spare the time, do come again. I might still have other matters in which you might have a hand.
