Chef Mao: Many thanks.
Chef Mao: Please take care while traveling to Jueyun Karst. <color=#00E1FFFF>Don't fly about or climb any way you like</color>, or I fear that we might anger the adepti.
Chef Mao: <color=#00E1FFFF>Don't touch any strange elements</color>, either, or you'll ruin the taste.

Chef Mao: As if Jueyun Karst was a border that ordinary mortals could trespass!
Chef Mao: Ahem. Well, whatever the case, could you help us deliver this order to Jueyun Karst? Let's see if we can get it there in time.
