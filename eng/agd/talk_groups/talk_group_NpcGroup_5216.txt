Damestier: *cough* Well, if you're not interested in the Mekafish in the water, then I haven't much else I can tell you about.

Damestier: That said... a fishing hobbyist who enjoys collecting Mekafish did tell me that there seem to be Condessence Crystals nearby...
Damestier: What do you think he meant by saying that? That he might make more Mekafish using those ores? ... Ugh, he'd better not. The Mekafish population shouldn't be allowed to grow, no sir!
Damestier: Ugh, what to do... Wait, do you need ore? What would you say to going over there and grabbing it all first?

Traveler: Mekafish?
Damestier: The ones swimming about in the water.
Damestier: I was part of the research team that developed them. The original idea was to have them clean up trash and junk from the water.
Damestier: But a few problems emerged during development, and the Mekafish started treating everything that wasn't the water itself as "junk" and cleaning it all up...
Damestier: We planned to turn them off remotely and retrieve them, then figure out what the problem was... But we never imagined the Institute would... y'know, explode...

Traveler: I spot some people trying to catch Mekafish...
Damestier: Oh, that... Technically, that's not fishing, but guiding Mekafish to designated spots with a specialized flashing gadget.
Damestier: It's intended for the regular maintenance of the Mekafish... I still have some here. You can try it out if you're interested.

Traveler: What happened afterwards?
Damestier: *sigh* ...Most of my research team perished in the blast. Only a few survived. I was one of the survivors, obviously.
Damestier: But... Well, none of us survivors really understood the core technology, so we couldn't control the Mekafish. And we couldn't just start the research over again, either...
Damestier: All we could do was stand around watching the malfunctioning ones swimming out of control, and the broken ones just floating there.
Damestier: And just then, a bunch of reporters turned up demanding to know why we weren't doing anything about the chaos...
Damestier: But I wanted to help! I'd love to retrieve the Mekafish! But... But I don't know how!
Damestier: Oh, what should I do... Can't anyone help me...
