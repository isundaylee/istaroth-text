# Talk Dialog

Traveler: So you don't like him?
Bhai: Honestly, I don't hate him at all. When he was young, he was passionate and talkative. He knew a great deal about poetry and singing, and I found that quite enviable.
Bhai: But now, his attitude is really driving me nuts. He could've done so much better than this!
Bhai: Shouldn't we who are alive cherish what we have and live in the present instead of trapping ourselves in the past?
Bhai: Old memories should nourish new life instead of becoming shackles that keep you in an endless loop of pain.
Bhai: I mean, the Dendro Archon may have lost much of her power, but that lost power became the nutrients required to save the world!
Bhai: That crusty old fellow has lived in Sumeru for so long, and yet, he doesn't understand this. He hasn't learned a thing from her at all!
