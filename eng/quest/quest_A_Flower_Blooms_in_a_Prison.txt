# A Flower Blooms in a Prison


## Talk 1

Kamisato Ayaka: Traveler, Paimon... It is a pleasure to finally meet you both face-to-face, hehe.
Kamisato Ayaka: I have heard all about how you helped our three friends. My sincerest thanks to you.
Traveler: Actually, we didn't really help at all...
Paimon: *sigh* Yeah... short of getting them their Visions back, it seems like there's no way to really help them...
Paimon: Um, Ayaka — how come this time you get to come out and meet us in person?
Kamisato Ayaka: Hehe, because now that you have done the three things I asked of you, I consider you to be my friends. As you will observe, I dispense with the screen for Thoma, also.
Thoma: Mm-hmm.
Paimon: Wait a second, but isn't Thoma your, um... servant? Paimon's happy to help and all, but Paimon sure as heck did not sign up to be a servant!
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh...! Ahaha, Paimon you are most entertaining. Thoma is first and foremost my friend, and was so before he ever became my attendant.
Paimon: Oh, okay then... Ayaka, you seem pretty different out in the open compared to how you are behind the screen. Mmm... Alright, we can be friends.
Traveler: Alright then.
Kamisato Ayaka: Hehe, thank you both kindly.
Kamisato Ayaka: Back to the matter at hand. You have now witnessed the pain of those deprived of their Visions... What are your feelings on what you have seen?
Traveler: I hope they can one day be free from their torment.
Kamisato Ayaka: *sigh* ...Perhaps, in the eyes of a deity such as the Almighty Shogun, the lives of those who inhabit the world are inconsequential...
Kamisato Ayaka: Thunder's roar, lightning's flash, the wind's assault, and the rain's descent... all these things take place with no regard for the feelings of the common people.
Kamisato Ayaka: But I believe that surely you understand what they must endure.
Traveler: ...
Kamisato Ayaka: It seems that perhaps now, you can appreciate my feelings on all of this. In which case... perhaps you would be willing to reconsider your stance?
Traveler: I will help you fight the Vision Hunt Decree.
Kamisato Ayaka: You will? Really!?
Traveler: But you must keep the promise you made me.
Kamisato Ayaka: Naturally, hehe.
Thoma: Alright, bravo, milady. You were right all along.
Kamisato Ayaka: #See... I told you {F#she}{M#he} wouldn't reject them. I'd placed my trust in the right person after all.
Kamisato Ayaka: Now then, given that the remainder of our discussion pertains to matters of a more... confidential nature... perhaps we could move to the Komore Teahouse? We ought not to involve other members of the Yashiro Commission.
Traveler: It seems to be a fate worse than death.
Traveler: Friend request accepted.
Traveler: The damage done by losing a Vision can't be completely undone.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Let's see what we've got here. Hmm, fresh fish fillets, shrimp, bamboo shoots...
Paimon: Nice! You can't go wrong with these. Paimon can't wait!
Paimon: Paimon never thought we'd be the only ones to actually put anything edible into the pot... Don't go wasting the rest now!
Paimon: *sigh* This was possibly the scariest-looking hot pot Paimon's ever seen... Fortunately, Thoma ended up eating all the weird stuff.
Thoma: You can say that again... But hey, at least I got the most points... Ugh, wait a moment... that doesn't feel good...
Kamisato Ayaka: I'm afraid it's your own fault for adding all those strange ingredients Thoma. The soup flavor wasn't quite the same afterwards...
Kamisato Ayaka: #Even with {NICKNAME}'s normal ingredients, I still couldn't guess any of them correctly.
Paimon: #But weren't you the one who added those little cakes Ayaka? Hehe, I think {NICKNAME} ended up eating one.
Paimon: Boiling cakes in hot pot... bleurgh... think of the texture...
Kamisato Ayaka: I must apologize... To be perfectly honest, I thought the cakes would be a tasty addition.
Thoma: Uh oh, I'm definitely not okay... Ugh, I need to lie down.
Thoma: Whew... I feel like a new man.
Paimon: Uh, you know, Thoma... all you had to do was guess wrong on purpose and it would've been someone else's turn. Talk about being competitive...
Thoma: Haha, guess I've been feeling unlucky recently and wanted the God of Hot Pot's blessing.
Thoma: Perhaps I did get a little carried away... Still, I couldn't be beaten at my own game first time around!
Thoma: I think my luck has already taken a turn for the better — I can sense it!
Thoma: So without further ado, I hereby declare that the winner of today's hot pot challenge is... me!
Paimon: Oh brother...
Thoma: Ahh... good effort team, another important job taken care of. Next on the agenda: some well-earned rest and relaxation.
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes, if the Tenryou Commission truly is as busy with preparations as Thoma claims, then some rest would be a welcome change of pace.
Kamisato Ayaka: And with the extra time, there are some other matters I wish to attend to...
Thoma: Let's all take some much-needed time off. After a few days' rest, we'll reconvene at the Komore Teahouse and discuss our next operation.
Thoma: Downtime is hard to come by these days, so be sure to make the most of it!
Thoma: I'll tidy things up here and start thinking about our ingredients for our next round, hehe.
Paimon: There's gonna be a sequel!?
Thoma: Sure, why not! We should play again now that everyone knows the rules. I'll see you all later!
Paimon: Bye, Thoma!
Paimon: Hmm, seems we won't need to be visiting the Komore Teahouse for a while. Why don't we go explore some other places!

## Talk 3

Okawara Goemon: Just hand it over, you don't want any trouble with me.
Okawara Goemon: If you think your elemental powers are enough to resist the Vision Hunt Decree, then you'd better think again.
Okawara Goemon: Believe me, you're not the first of your kind we've encountered... And we've seen the same unpleasant outcome time after time. You'd best save yourself the trouble.
Hanshirou: Can't you make an exception? I just got this Vision — I won't even use it, I promise.
Paimon: So this is the Vision Hunt Decree in action, huh? We can't just sit around and watch things unfold, can we?
Traveler: Let's move!
Yoimiya: Psst...! Hey — wait...!
Paimon: Huh? There's someone trying to get our attention.
Yoimiya: Come on...! This way...!
Paimon: Huh, what's going on!? Can't you see we need to go help...
Yoimiya: Shh! Quiet! Just sit tight and watch for a moment...
Paimon: Hey! This isn't right, y'know! Just because you don't have a Vision doesn't mean you can sit back and watch others in trouble...
Paimon: Huh? Hey wait... you do have a Vision!
Yoimiya: Shh! If you don't keep your voice down, I won't have one much longer!
Hanshirou: Alright, alright... Here... take it.
Okawara Goemon: Hm, wise choice. Alright, let's go!
Paimon: What should we do now? He's already given up his Vision... Doesn't he know what could happen to him after losing it?
Paimon: Ugh, this is your fault. You're the one who stopped us from interfering!
Hanshirou: Phew! Many thanks, Miss Yoimiya. If you hadn't swapped me a fake just now, I'm sure I would have lost it.
Yoimiya: No worries! You put on quite the convincing performance!
Traveler: So the Vision they took was fake?
Paimon: Ohh, so that's what's going on here! And to think Paimon was about to unleash Paimonial wrath on Miss Yoimiya... hehehe... sorry about that.
Yoimiya: Haha, ahh think nothing of it! I could tell from your reaction we were on the same side — you just didn't know it, y'know?
Yoimiya: Alright — allow me to introduce myself. I'm Yoimiya, the current owner of Naganohara Fireworks. It ain't much, but it's honest work, hehe. Great to meet ya!
Hanshirou: Practically everyone in Hanamizaka knows Yoimiya. She's the "Queen of the Summer Festival"! Without her and her fireworks, summer on Narukami Island just wouldn't be the same.
Paimon: Whoa, that's quite the introduction! Paimon loves fireworks! It's nice to meet you.
Yoimiya: Hee-hee, stop it Hanshirou, you'll embarrass me!
Yoimiya: As for thanking me, you'd be better off thanking Master Masakatsu. He's the one that gave me the fake Visions in the first place.
Yoimiya: His handiwork allowed me to keep my own Vision. Whew, I can't even imagine trying to run the business without it...
Hanshirou: Yes, Master Masakatsu is a good man. It's too bad good people seldom get the recognition they deserve.
Paimon: Master Masakatsu!?
Yoimiya: Huh? Do you guys know him too?
Traveler: Miss Kamisato mentioned his name.
Yoimiya: You don't say! Then it sounds like the Shirasagi Himegimi has a plan... Awesome! I've been thinking about breaking him out too recently.
Yoimiya: But if I just marched straight in there by myself, I'd probably get Miss Kamisato in a whole heap of trouble, hehe...
Yoimiya: So... what about if I join you instead!?
Paimon: Sure! Welcome to the team! Ayaka told us to go look for help at a fireworks shop. She must have meant you!
Yoimiya: Hee-hee, seems like I've finally got a new job to do! ...Y'know, besides hiding Vision bearers in my shop, that is...
Yoimiya: So, Master Masakatsu is being held at the Police Station. I've already surveyed the area and found a way in.
Paimon: Whoa, talk about a reliable source. Seems we've got the right person on our team!
Yoimiya: Not bad, huh? Hehe. Let's go as soon as everyone's ready. Don't worry Master Masakatsu, we're on our way!
Paimon: Time to break him out!
Traveler: We were just on our way to rescue him.
Traveler: Seems we were fooled, too...

## Talk 4

Paimon: Uh... Now that we're inside, this place is a whole lot creepier than Paimon imagined... Eh-he...
Yoimiya: C'mon, this way! As long as we stay quiet, we've got a good chance!
Yoimiya: I certainly wouldn't want to end up locked away in here... Let's find Master Masakatsu and get out of here.
Yoimiya: We should split up. I've got a "little present" to prepare for Master Masakatsu, hehe... I'll be right back.
Paimon: You sure? Alright then... Just be careful not to get caught!
Yoimiya: Yes, uh — you too!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Shh... quick, hide! Look over there...
Paimon: That must be Master Masakatsu!
Kinoshita: ...Did you really think that little trick of yours could fool us?
Maeda: Hehe... locking you up was just the beginning.
Masakatsu: ...Argh... No...!
Yoimiya: Oh no... Those Tenryou Commission brutes are torturing him.
Paimon: If we don't come up with a way to break him out fast, then... Eh!? Yoimiya, when did you get back here...
Traveler: We can only grit our teeth for now...
Yoimiya: Ugh... I can't bear to watch. If anything happens to Master Masakatsu, our whole plan will have been for nothing...
Kujou Sara: Hey, you there! What are you doing!?
Kinoshita: Ah! M—Ma'am!
Maeda: W—We were just teaching him a little lesson... That's all.
Paimon: Huh? Who's that?
Yoimiya: That's Kujou Sara, adopted daughter of the Kujou Clan of the Tenryou Commission. She's also a general in the Shogun's Army. What's she doing here...?
Traveler: I think Kazuha mentioned her before...
Yoimiya: Make way, let me have a look at him.
Kujou Sara: ...
Kujou Sara: I'm sure you're well aware that torture is strictly against military regulations.
Kinoshita: Y—Yes, ma'am.
Kujou Sara: If you are unashamed of such disgraceful action, then you are also unworthy of the Tenryou Commission itself! Do I make myself clear!?
Maeda: Y—Yes, ma'am. I—It won't happen again!
Paimon: Whew, Paimon sure wouldn't want to get on her bad side...
Yoimiya: Hey, this is our chance! Let's move while they aren't watching Master Masakatsu.
Paimon: Yoimiya! Are you sure now's the right time!?
Yoimiya: Ah...
Kujou Sara: Who is that...
Kujou Sara: Quick, go and investigate.
Kinoshita: Yes, ma'am!
Paimon: Th—They're coming! Quick — hide!
Yoimiya: Sorry sorry sorry! I didn't mean to...
Traveler: We're in trouble now.
Yoimiya: Don't worry, I've got us covered. Time for my "little present..."
Yoimiya: BOOM!!!
Paimon: Wha—! Fireworks!?
Kinoshita: Huh? Was that an explosion!?
Maeda: I—It sounded like... fireworks?
Kinoshita: Quick, let's hurry!
Paimon: Whew, the fireworks were enough to distract them! Maybe more than enough, hehe...
Yoimiya: Hehe, fireworks aren't just for festivals y'know.
Traveler: Nice work!
Traveler: I knew we could count on you!
Yoimiya: Hee-hee, I was particularly proud of this batch, I decided to—
Yoimiya: POW!!! CRACKLE CRACKLE... FIZZZZ!
Kinoshita: Wahhhhhh!!!
Paimon: Eh-he... Uh, Yoimiya... this is turning into a bit of a fireworks display, hehe...
Yoimiya: Well... fireworks are my craft after all. Every batch has to be spectacular! Hee-hee...
Traveler: I'm beginning to think this wasn't only intended as a distraction...
Paimon: Look, the coast is clear. Now's our chance!
Traveler: Well, those guards deserved what they got...
Traveler: They'll find us for sure if we don't do something.
Traveler: She's also enforcing the Vision Hunt Decree.
Traveler: We need to ensure we have a means of escape.

## Talk 6

Thoma: I see, so Kujou Sara stayed her hand. It would appear she still has some honor to her.
Thoma: I wonder if we should try establishing contact with her... Perhaps we could coax out some information.
Kamisato Ayaka: Unlikely.
Kamisato Ayaka: Don't forget, Kujou Sara is also carrying out the Vision Hunt Decree. She obeys the orders of the Raiden Shogun without question.
Kamisato Ayaka: In her eyes, Master Masakatsu is of no threat to the decree. This is why she was so willing to allow his escape.
Kamisato Ayaka: If our true motives were ever divulged, she would act against us without a second thought.
Thoma: True... Though if you ask me, Master Masakatsu's release is an unexpected blessing.
Thoma: #We are now one step closer to victory... and we couldn't have done it without Yoimiya and {NICKNAME}!
Thoma: Hehe, you're turning out to be even more reliable than we expected.
Traveler: Thanks for the compliment.
Paimon: Hee-hee, don't mention it.
Kamisato Ayaka: #Indeed, things may have turned out very differently this time without the help of {NICKNAME}.
Kamisato Ayaka: But if we wish to mount any sizable resistance against the Vision Hunt Decree... there is still much to be done.
Kamisato Ayaka: It is time we make ready our next set of plans...
Thoma: There's no need to rush, milady.
Thoma: Things seem to have taken a turn for the better, at least. Not only have we rescued Master Masakatsu, but our list of allies appears to be growing.
Thoma: Ah yes, which reminds me... The Tenryou Commission seems to be making preparations for a "celebration"... They call it a "ceremony" of sorts.
Thoma: And the number of samurai out enforcing the Vision Hunt Decree seems to be waning. The days ahead may be more peaceful than usual.
Kamisato Ayaka: A "ceremony," you say? Why would such a task be left to the Tenryou Commission?
Thoma: I don't know, but I'm sure it has nothing to do with us. Anyway, with the Tenryou Commission busy with preparations, we should have a little more breathing room than usual.
Kamisato Ayaka: Hmm, you do present a good point.
Kamisato Ayaka: Being in a constant state of alert will only tire us further, perhaps a period of rest is in order.
Kamisato Ayaka: Thoma, what would you suggest?
Thoma: I'd say a celebratory feast is in order. Might I suggest an evening of hot pot together!
Thoma: Funny enough, I learned a new "hot pot game" recently. I'm sure you'll find it quite amusing!
Paimon: A hot pot game? What's that? Well, as long as it has to do with eating...
Thoma: Simply put, every person prepares an ingredient to add to the hot pot. Once the meal begins, we add all the ingredients together.
Thoma: Then we take it in turns to close our eyes, pick an ingredient out of the pot, taste it, and guess whose ingredient it was.
Thoma: Anyone who guesses correctly can go again, and whoever finishes the meal with the most points is declared the winner. Tradition even has it that the winner receives blessings from the God of Hot Pot.
Thoma: Don't you think it sounds like fun? Hehe, I've been wanting to give it a try... In fact, I've already got my ingredients prepared!
Paimon: You really do wanna play, huh!
Paimon: Well, sounds like we've got our work cut out for us! Time to gather some ingredients. But... what should we choose?

## Talk 7

Paimon: Well, here we are again...
Thoma: Please, continue without me. I'll keep watch.
Paimon: So, what's the deal with this place, anyway? What makes it your favorite meeting spot?
Kamisato Ayaka: This is land that was gifted to the Yashiro Commission by the shogun. The Kamisato Clan has the exclusive right to plan, build, and repair any property on this land — and even to allow or deny access.
Kamisato Ayaka: Such privileges exist due to the Yashiro Commission's role in managing ceremonial affairs. Oftentimes, it is not appropriate to discuss details in front of bystanders.
Paimon: Ohh Paimon gets it — gotta keep a bit of mystery, right?
Kamisato Ayaka: Once the number of ceremonial affairs conducted in the city began to decline, our forebears built a teahouse here. Only members of the Yashiro Commission are permitted to come and go as they please.
Paimon: Makes sense. Perfect place for a secret base!

## Talk 8

Masakatsu: Y—Yoimiya? Is that you?
Yoimiya: Master Masakatsu! Sorry we took so long... Ugh... those awful guards!
Paimon: C'mon, we've got no time to lose! They could be back any minute...
Paimon: Oh...
Traveler: You were over there watching us this whole time, weren't you?
Kujou Sara: Yes. Leave, before I let my judgment get the better of me.
Kujou Sara: He's in serious condition, be sure he gets immediate medical attention.
Kujou Sara: But remember...
Kujou Sara: Once he's recovered, it won't be long until I bring him right back.
Yoimiya: Uh, well... Ahem, you can bet we'll do all we can to keep that from happening.
Traveler: Thank you...
Kujou Sara: Hm... leave this place.
Traveler: We will protect Master Masakatsu.

## Talk 9

Traveler: Let's be team daredevil...
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon proposes we gather raging demon-level Jueyun Chilis, super salty Ham, Mist Flower Corollas...
Paimon: This is already shaping up to be a hot pot to remember...
Thoma: Ugh, my stomach! It feels like Yoimiya's fireworks are going off inside me...
Paimon: Who would've guessed that Thoma would be the winner...? He ate practically all those weird ingredients without a second thought! Uh, Thoma? You okay buddy?
Thoma: Salt-crusted herring, unripe Lavender Melon, flash-boiled dango... Oh, and whatever that thing was that nearly froze my tongue off...
Thoma: Hold up, my life is starting to flash before my eyes... Time I call it a night, everyone...
Kamisato Ayaka: Hehe, you've only got yourself to blame Thoma... All those strange things you ate were ingredients you added yourself.
Paimon: #But weren't you the one who added those little cakes Ayaka? Hehe, I think {NICKNAME} ended up eating one.
Paimon: Boiling cakes in hot pot... bleurgh... think of the texture...
Kamisato Ayaka: I must apologize... To be perfectly honest, I thought the cakes would be a tasty addition.
Thoma: Uh oh, I'm definitely not okay... Ugh, I need to lie down.
Thoma: Whew... I feel like a new man.
Paimon: Uh, you know, Thoma... all you had to do was guess wrong on purpose and it would've been someone else's turn. Talk about being competitive...
Thoma: Haha, guess I've been feeling unlucky recently and wanted the God of Hot Pot's blessing.
Thoma: Perhaps I did get a little carried away... Still, I couldn't be beaten at my own game first time around!
Thoma: I think my luck has already taken a turn for the better — I can sense it!
Thoma: So without further ado, I hereby declare that the winner of today's hot pot challenge is... me!
Paimon: Oh brother...
Thoma: Ahh... good effort team, another important job taken care of. Next on the agenda: some well-earned rest and relaxation.
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes, if the Tenryou Commission truly is as busy with preparations as Thoma claims, then some rest would be a welcome change of pace.
Kamisato Ayaka: And with the extra time, there are some other matters I wish to attend to...
Thoma: Let's all take some much-needed time off. After a few days' rest, we'll reconvene at the Komore Teahouse and discuss our next operation.
Thoma: Downtime is hard to come by these days, so be sure to make the most of it!
Thoma: I'll tidy things up here and start thinking about our ingredients for our next round, hehe.
Paimon: There's gonna be a sequel!?
Thoma: Sure, why not! We should play again now that everyone knows the rules. I'll see you all later!
Paimon: Bye, Thoma!
Paimon: Hmm, seems we won't need to be visiting the Komore Teahouse for a while. Why don't we go explore some other places!

## Talk 10

Paimon: Phew! We're finally outta that creepy place.
Masakatsu: Yes... Finally, I've made it out of there...
Yoimiya: Master Masakatsu — how do you feel? Can you hold on?
Masakatsu: Don't worry, I think I can make it to the infirmary without keeling over.
Yoimiya: Thank you, all of you! I'll take him to get treated. I'll treat you to a round of drinks once this is all over!
Paimon: Don't worry about us, just take care of Master Masakatsu!
Paimon: Whew, good thing we were able to rescue him.
Traveler: Luck was on our side this time.
Paimon: Right, Kujou Sara... Do you think she was making up for how the guards were treating him?
Paimon: It seems as though there are some okay people among the ranks of the Tenryou Commission... Oh! Though Paimon would never agree with their actions in the Vision Hunt Decree, of course.
Paimon: How about we go tell Ayaka and the others the good news?
Traveler: All thanks to that person.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Kamisato Ayaka: #In any case, we can talk freely here. I presume {NICKNAME}, you have a few questions that you wish to ask me?

### Additional Talk 2

Traveler: What kind of god is the Raiden Shogun?
Kamisato Ayaka: The Almighty Shogun... I have seen her on but only a few occasions, most of them formal ceremonies...
Kamisato Ayaka: She inspires awe, commands respect, and exudes a sense of absolute authority. But as I recall, there was something else about her that struck me even more deeply...
Kamisato Ayaka: It was her almost complete lack of any emotion. In that sense, she appeared to me to be less of a ruler and more of... well, an executive official, I suppose. Focused exclusively on her single goal of implementing Eternity, acting accordingly without feeling.

### Additional Talk 3

Traveler: Is no one else fighting the Vision Hunt Decree?
Kamisato Ayaka: The issue is this... For the vast majority of people, the Vision Hunt Decree is something that has no implications whatsoever.
Kamisato Ayaka: After all, it is but a tiny minority of people who receive Visions. Moreover, it is not unknown for Visions to spark jealousy in others.
Kamisato Ayaka: Because of this, the attitude of most people towards the Vision Hunt Decree is one of indifference.
Paimon: How can they be like that...? Hmph, Paimon's getting mad...
Kamisato Ayaka: Nevertheless, in addition to us, there is also the resistance on Watatsumi Island.
Paimon: Resistance? You mean, like, an army fighting against the decree?
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes, many who have lost or fear losing their Visions have rallied together under Sangonomiya on Watatsumi Island to form a resistance group.
Kamisato Ayaka: To say a little more about Sangonomiya... Historically, there has always been some conflict between them and the Shogunate of Narukami Island due to their different belief systems.
Kamisato Ayaka: But I do wonder whether there may be some other agenda behind their resistance movement, beyond merely fighting the Vision Hunt Decree...

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: Have you raised a formal objection to the Vision Hunt Decree?
Kamisato Ayaka: Of course. We have tried on numerous occasions. Unfortunately, each time a proposal to repeal the decree arrives at Tenshukaku, it is promptly vetoed by both the Tenryou Commission and the Kanjou Commission, and subsequently scrapped...
Kamisato Ayaka: They invariably adopt a stance of unconditional support for the shogun's decisions. They have no interest in discussing anything.
Kamisato Ayaka: It almost makes one wonder whether they had a hand in the shogun's sudden decision to issue the Vision Hunt Decree...

### Additional Talk 5

Traveler: I have no further questions.
Paimon: Ooh, ooh, Paimon has a question though!
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh? What would you like to know, Paimon?
Paimon: Have you got a plan yet? To fight the Vision Hunt Decree?
Kamisato Ayaka: To be honest... we do not.
Paimon: Wh—What!
Kamisato Ayaka: Please, do not forget that challenging the Vision Hunt Decree is tantamount to challenging a deity. Coming to terms with that is already a difficult step to take.
Paimon: So... So, what're we gonna do?
Kamisato Ayaka: Well, for the moment, all we can do is to try and reduce the harm that is being caused by this decree.
Kamisato Ayaka: For example, by providing Vision bearers with safe refuge, or manufacturing counterfeit Visions for them as a contingency measure.
Paimon: You're telling Paimon that there are people out there who can make fake Visions!?
Kamisato Ayaka: Don't underestimate the talents of the craftspeople in Hanamizaka. To the naked eye, their counterfeits are indistinguishable from the genuine article.
Traveler: Must have been where Venti went...
Kamisato Ayaka: The problem we are facing right now is that Master Masakatsu, who was providing us with counterfeit Visions, has recently been arrested by the Tenryou Commission.
Paimon: Oh darn! So they found out about it? Ugh...
Kamisato Ayaka: Yes... We knew it was not a long-term solution and that it was only a matter of time before it would be exposed... But we cannot simply abandon Master Masakatsu.
Traveler: He has saved many others.
Kamisato Ayaka: Exactly, I feel the same way. But given mine and Thoma's identities as part of the Yashiro Commission, breaking him out of prison would risk dragging down the reputation of the entire Kamisato Clan should we be caught. That would only serve to cast suspicion on any future activity we might seek to attempt.
Traveler: So you're offloading that job to me, huh?
Kamisato Ayaka: Hehe, by no means do we intend to place the burden of such a task on your shoulders alone.
Kamisato Ayaka: When you are ready, go to Hanamizaka, and look for a fireworks shop run by the Naganohara family. There, you will find someone who can help you.
Traveler: It is only right that he should be saved, too.
Traveler: I kind of want one, too...

### Additional Talk 6

Thoma: Hey, all finished? I've been keeping watch and I'm happy to report that everything is fine and dandy!

### Additional Talk 7

Kamisato Ayaka: You want to know who you'll be meeting in Hanamizaka? Let's just say... they'll be easy to find. You'll see what I mean when you get there, hehe.
