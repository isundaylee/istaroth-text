Takahashi: Ah, when do you think this war will end, eh...
Takahashi: I am willing to do anything to keep my sister safe, but I don't want to fight this war.

Traveler: About your sister...
Takahashi: Yeah, I have a very cute little sister. She is currently back home on Watatsumi Island.
Takahashi: My sister is still young, but she is very clever and understanding. As her big brother, I hope that she can remain innocent and pure. I really don't want her to find out about the ugly side of this world.
Takahashi: Didn't someone once say that there is no winner in a war? As long as there is conflict, people will get hurt.
Takahashi: Therefore, I have to stay here and fight for the sake of my sister's safety even though I hate fighting. I shall not let the Shogunate's army set foot upon my homeland.

Traveler: Goodbye.
Takahashi: Goodbye. I hope my little sister at home is doing well...

## Talk

Traveler: About your homeland...
Takahashi: My family spent many generations in Bourou Village on Watatsumi Island. It's a small village with beautiful scenery, and people lead peaceful lives there.
Takahashi: When I was small, I would often listen to the sound of waterfalls nearby. I would stay there for the whole day...
Takahashi: If it wasn't for this war, I probably would never have left my home and would have just spent a quiet, peaceful life there instead...

Takahashi: Sangonomiya and the Shogunate have signed their ceasefire agreement. Guess we shouldn't expect a resumption of the conflict any time soon.
Takahashi: I just hope I can return to see my sister soon.

Takahashi: Yeah, I have a very cute little sister. She is currently back home on Watatsumi Island.
Takahashi: My sister is still young, but she is very clever and understanding. As her big brother, I hope that she can remain innocent and pure even as she grows up healthy and strong.
Takahashi: I will do my best to keep the peace for her sake as well. The Shogun's Army will not set foot on our homeland â€” not if I have anything to say about that!
