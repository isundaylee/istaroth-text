## Talk

Kumi: Oh, it's you. Welcome.

## Talk

Traveler: How have you been recently?
Kumi: Thanks for your concern. I've been doing quite well.
Kumi: Originally, I'd only intended to say goodbye to Kuntira and make peace with some parts of my life.
Kumi: But now, I feel like this place is more like my home than Narukami Island... And I can experience new joys here that are more than just memories.
Kumi: So I feel that continuing to live here isn't bad either.

## Talk

Traveler: About Anisa...
Kumi: She's... still as reckless as ever...
Kumi: She doesn't seem to act like she's in a different nation at all. She just keeps going to strange and dangerous places every day...
Kumi: And once she gets into her studies, that's the whole day she'll be spending on research I can't make heads or tails out of...
Kumi: She honestly worries me a bit.
Kumi: But she's also very considerate, and her voice is quite lovely. I think I can bear with it, I guess...
Kumi: Um, don't misunderstand, please. She's a good person, so it's not as if I dislike her or something...

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Kumi: Bye. I hope that everything goes well with you.

## Talk

Traveler: I'm glad that we met.
Kumi: I feel the same way. Thank you for your help previously.
Kumi: Oh, by the way... Anisa's been trying really hard to get used to life here. Lately, she's been learning how to make our local cuisine from me.
Kumi: It's just that she's, uh, made some changes to it based on flavors from Sumeru... I hope you don't mind.
