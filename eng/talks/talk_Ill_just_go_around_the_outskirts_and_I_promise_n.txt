Dunya: I'll just go around the outskirts, and I promise not to break the rules and head inside, alright?
Juzjani: As both a researcher and a doctor, I don't recommend that you go there.
Juzjani: There used to be a hospital that the Akademiya used to study Eleazar. Entry to its ruins is prohibited now.
Dunya: I study history, so I know all about that. I just think that I'll discover something if I can actually visit the place.
Juzjani: Based on the record, no effective method of treatment for Eleazar has been found yet, and the hospital's ruins were sealed up.
Juzjani: Even people from Aaru Village that is just nearby rarely go that way.
Juzjani: I don't see the need to risk breaking the Akademiya's orders just to satisfy groundless curiosity.
Dunya: *sigh* I really can't win in an argument against you. You medical people are just too careful.
