Traveler: How's business been lately?
Eloffe: Thanks to you, Ms. Chiori's fashion show was a smash hit.
Eloffe: Since then, we've launched a large number of new products, and customers have been pouring in like a waterfall. If anything, we haven't got enough manpower to handle it all.
Eloffe: Ms. Chiori has even mentioned that she'd like to go on a trip with you sometime.
Eloffe: Ah, but be sure not to tell her that I was the one who told you.
