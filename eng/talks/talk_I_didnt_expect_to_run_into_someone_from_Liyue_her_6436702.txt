Traveler: I didn't expect to run into someone from Liyue here.
Yinjie: Haha, to be honest, I didn't expect to stay here for so long either!
Yinjie: My plan was to try my luck in the desert and maybe make some money, but I found out that many had the same idea.
Yinjie: It was only after they arrived here that many realized they forgot to bring this, or didn't prepare that...
Yinjie: I gave it some thought and decided to do business here in Caravan Ribat instead, and I specialize in giving adventurers a chance to resupply before venturing into the desert.
