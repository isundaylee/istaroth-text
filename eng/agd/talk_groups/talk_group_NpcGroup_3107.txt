Traveler: About drawing fortune slips...
Maki: The people who come to the shrine are mostly looking for the archon's blessings.
Maki: They believe that if they get a good fortune slip, they will be blessed by the Electro Archon, and that life will be easy in the upcoming days.
Maki: But if they get a bad slip, they can still leave the slip at the shrine in hopes for a change of fate.

Maki: That's right. This is the "eternity" that the Electro Archon is pursuing. It seems like you already know something about Inazuma.
Maki: You can have this small floral ornament. Even though it's not formed from divine powers, it should still be able to accompany you for a long time. I wish you good luck.
