Traveler: Sounds like a good idea.
Robert: I know, right? If I can set up early, I might just hit upon some good opportunities first.
Robert: But I reckon that my documents are going to need updating first. I was going to ask my Snezhnayan friend for help, actually, but I haven't been able to contact him at all...
Robert: I've been stuck here in Ritou so long, I'm almost out of Mora on hand. Oh, what am I going to do...
Robert: You know what? I think I'll just go over to Miss Ryouko's for a drink. She'll be able to console me for sure, bless her kind soul.
