Traveler: Hello.
Marette: Oh, it's you. I remember you, and your little friend as well. You're the ones the Iudex personally had escorted over here. You don't see that every day.
Marette: Let's see here... Your files have been updated. Congratulations, consider your sentence officially served. You're free to go back to a place where the sun shines brightly and live your life as you see fit.
