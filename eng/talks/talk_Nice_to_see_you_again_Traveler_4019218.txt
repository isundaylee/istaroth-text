Chiori: #Nice to see you again, Traveler.
Traveler: You made the trip from Fontaine?
Chiori: Yes. The news spread far and wide. A festival for humans and youkai alike is a grand occasion, after all.
Chiori: Ayaka happened to send me an invitation, as well, so I came to check it out... I have to say, the atmosphere in Inazuma seems much improved since I left.
