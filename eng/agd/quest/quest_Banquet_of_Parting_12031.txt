# Banquet of Parting


## Talk 1

Yae Miko: Well hello there, my little helpers, so nice of you to join me. You're right on time, too.
Paimon: Hmph, as if we had a choice. We just want our paychecks.
Paimon: So, Miko, what exactly do we have to do to make this Hyakkiyakou happen?
Paimon: Also, to be clear, we actually have no idea what it even means.
Yae Miko: It might sound ominous, but to put it simply, the Hyakkiyakou is just a gathering of the youkai.
Yae Miko: Back in the day, at youkai gatherings, once everyone had had plenty to drink, one by one they'd start soaring into the sky with their youkai powers. There were so many of them that their silhouettes would block out the moon.
Yae Miko: But now, the youkai memories that leak from the Ley Lines are weak. They are no longer able to fly.
Yae Miko: So, I will be performing a convocation ritual for them, gathering all the wandering memories together in one place.
Yae Miko: When the time comes, they will gather in the sky above the Grand Narukami Shrine. Once their energy is spent, they will be satisfied, and return to where they belong.
Traveler: I see. I understand.
Yae Miko: All the preparations for the ritual have actually been made well in advance. Remember the incantation and the mention of "moonless night" that I added to our novel?
Paimon: Oh yeah, something about reciting "The Secret Spells of Lady Kitsune" on a moonless night.
Yae Miko: That's the one. Actually, it's not a wish-granting incantation at all. It's a spell to help calm the Ley Line memories.
Yae Miko: When that time comes, let's all pitch in and help send them on their way!
Traveler: What do you need from me?
Yae Miko: I will start the ritual preparations shortly, and at that time, I need you to do two things:
Yae Miko: First, tell the shrine maidens to leave the mountain.
Yae Miko: During the Hyakkiyakou, a whole swarm of youkai memories will be hanging around in the air above the Grand Narukami Shrine. Having the shrine maidens leave avoids the bothersome issue of someone potentially getting possessed.
Yae Miko: After that, I will commence the ritual, and the memories will begin to congregate. This will take some time. I need you at the foot of Mt. Yougou during this part to keep an eye on nearby monster activity.
Yae Miko: The memories are normally dispersed, and don't pose a threat. But when their energy is concentrated, it is likely to disturb the monsters.
Yae Miko: They may see this as an opportunity to try and make it up the mountain. I need you to fend them off so that that doesn't happen.
Paimon: Alright, got it. Then what?
Yae Miko: Hmm... Well, if at that point you felt like coming to the shrine and getting a close-up view of the youkai, I wouldn't say no.
Paimon: #Okay, Traveler, let's get going!

## Talk 2

Maki: ...Descend the mountain? Are those Lady Guuji's orders?
Paimon: Yep, Miko said the ritual she's gonna perform soon might pose a physical danger to you all.
Maki: I see... I'll evacuate everyone right away. What about you?
Paimon: We'll be taking care of a couple other things for her, and once we're done with that, we're gonna come back and do the ritual together.
Traveler: Because we want to make sure she's safe, too.
Maki: It seems like Lady Guuji places great trust in you.
Maki: Lady Guuji's never allowed anyone else to be in her presence when she's conducted rituals like this in the past.
Maki: Thank you for helping with the ritual, and... good luck.
Paimon: Don't worry, we're much stronger than we look!
Traveler: Because we want to see the youkai.

## Talk 3

Yae Miko: Hm, just as I thought, the ritual went very smoothly. Thank you both.
Traveler: Miko, are you alright?
Yae Miko: Hmm? I'm great.
Paimon: But, the look on your face just now...
Yae Miko: I'm fine, seriously. Really! I...
Yae Miko: Huh... Honestly, you two...
Paimon: Miko...
Yae Miko: Fine, well if you're dead-set on doing something for me, you can treat me to a meal.
Paimon: Sure, no problem! A meal it is!
Traveler: A meal? It's a deal!
Yae Miko: Okay. Well, see you soon, then.

## Talk 4

Black Screen Text: As night falls, the monsters slowly congregate in this area...
Paimon: These monsters look really riled up!
Traveler: We can't let them up the mountain.
Traveler: Let's get rid of them, for Miko.
Paimon: Yup yup! Let's get rid of them as fast as we can! Then we can get back in time to see the youkai!
Paimon: #Alright, here they come, Traveler!

## Talk 5

Yae Miko: Ah, my little friends, there you are.
Paimon: Miko... what is this? You started eating without us!?
Yae Miko: I did, yes. You're paying, after all.
Yae Miko: The thought of being able to eat the most expensive dishes and drink the finest sake, all for absolutely free... Oh, I just couldn't wait any longer.
Yae Miko: Ah, Boss, see these two faces here? Remember them. They're the ones picking up the bill later.
Okazaki Rikuto: Alrighty!
Paimon: Uhhh...
Traveler: ...
Yae Miko: What's gotten into you? Come on, sit yourselves down.
Yae Miko: You have to try this fish. It's found exclusively in the waters around Seirai Island. They shipped it to Inazuma overnight, and it was still alive right up until I ordered it.
Yae Miko: Or maybe you'd rather try this? I know, I know — I normally can't bring myself to drink sake this expensive either.
Yae Miko: If you don't drink alcohol, that's fine too. There are all kinds of fruit juices covering the whole price spectrum.
Paimon: Grrr... Miko! You are outrageous!
Paimon: Last time we were here working on the novel, all you ordered for us was the plainest Kushikatsu!
Yae Miko: Huh? Strange, I remember no such thing.
Traveler: Well I certainly remember it.
Yae Miko: Oh. So what? You did offer to treat me to a meal, didn't you? Anyway, I am something of a VIP, you know. Wouldn't you find it embarrassing to treat me anything short of lavishly?
Paimon: Miko, this meal is going to be super expensive. Aren't you afraid we won't be able to afford it?
Yae Miko: Hehe, oh, don't you worry about that. You can most definitely afford it... They're still printing your light novel by the batch, you know. You have quite the generous payment due.
Paimon: Wh—What!?
Paimon: #Aaaah, darn it!!! She tricked us into this, Traveler! Miko was after our Mora from the very beginning!
Traveler: Shouldn't have let our guard down...
Yae Miko: Hahaha, oh, the looks on your faces right now. Too perfect. Hahaha.
Yae Miko: Oh, by the way — since nobody's wishes came true on the moonless night, novels with incantations are no longer in vogue.
Yae Miko: So you'll have to come up with something new for the next chapter of "The Miraculous Adventures of the Traveler."
Yae Miko: The deadline is looming... I'm counting on you.
Traveler: We've been taken for a ride...
Traveler: Kushikatsu and Fried Tofu. That was it.

## Talk 6

Yae Miko: Thank you for the meal. I thoroughly enjoyed myself today.
Yae Miko: Oh, did I mention? Ei saw that convocation ritual we performed over the Grand Narukami Shrine.
Yae Miko: I know she can be pig-headed, but it still took me by surprise when she wrote me a long and sternly worded letter about it, chastising me for "taking this whole thing much too far."
Yae Miko: Ugh, I hardly see what all the fuss is about. Everyone seemed perfectly happy to me.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Kyouta: Ugh, the wait is unbearable! How has the next chapter of "The Miraculous Adventures of the Traveler" not been released yet!
Oosuke: It was quite a surprise when the "moonless night" finally came.
Tetsuo: Yeah, that huge black cloud over Mt. Yougou that night. It just seemed to form out of nowhere!
Oosuke: But then nothing happened after I made a wish using the method in that book.
Tetsuo: *sigh* I guess light novels are just fiction after all, huh.
Oosuke: That night was definitely the nail in the coffin for the "incantations from novels" fad. Still, something tells me "The Miraculous Adventures of the Traveler" will remain an interesting series for a long time to come!
Paimon: Huh? Paimon can't see Miko anywhere.
Paimon: Guess she's not out here. Uh... maybe she went inside already? Let's head in and look for her.
