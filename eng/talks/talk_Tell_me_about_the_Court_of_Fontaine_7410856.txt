Traveler: Tell me about the Court of Fontaine.
Aeval: Yup! That's my favorite place — wait, no, it's probably my second-favorite...? The place I love most is still Merusea Village, I reckon!
Aeval: That's our homeland — a warm and comfy place. It's not as big or as pretty as the Court of Fontaine, but I actually get a bit scared of having so many pretty things and big houses around sometimes...
Aeval: Ah, um, sorry! About the Court... You're a traveler, aren't you, dear passenger? In which case, you should go pay Lady Furina a visit — by that, I mean the Statue of The Seven!
Aeval: Other than that, I really love Café Lutece! When I'm free, I often sit there with my senior, who always takes good care of me, and we take in the scent of coffee!
Aeval: As for Hotel Debord... Well, it's not really to my tastes, but it's recommended by the official guide, so I'm sure it's alright!
Aeval: Bertin's House of Curiosities and Chioriya Boutique are also pretty good! That senior of mine who I go coffee-smelling with often gets clothes made there, though we usually don't have much opportunity to wear them...
Aeval: As for the rest... Uhh...
Aeval: Right! Once you go leave Hotel Debord, you can head straight to reach The Steambird publishing house! Feel free to subscribe to them!
