Qiuyue: People have been asking me lately if I know where to find Mr. Zhenyu from Liyue, but I've never heard of this person in my life.
Qiuyue: Is he some kind of superstar, even more well-known than the Qixing somehow?
Qiuyue: Ah, sorry for the wait, dear customer. Would you like some ores from Liyue?

## Talk

Traveler: Is there anything of note nearby?

## Talk

Qiuyue: Well... I'd say that things are the same as always. The flow of goods from Liyue is as bottle-necked as ever. No special change on that front.

## Talk

Qiuyue: Hmm. It does seem like more and more people have decided to come to Ritou to set up shop.
Qiuyue: There'll be more competition, but more customers as well, so I suppose it's a net gain.

## Talk

Qiuyue: Dear guest, would you like to purchase some minerals from Liyue?

## Talk

Traveler: Let's see what you've got.
Qiuyue: Come on in then, and take a look. These are all the finest!

## Talk

Traveler: About this shop...
Qiuyue: This shop is the Inazuma franchise of the Chuyu Trading Company. We mainly sell minerals, jewelry, and jade artifacts.
Qiuyue: We offer the finest minerals from Liyue. Each piece is a gift from Rex Lapis.
Qiuyue: Although we don't boast the same reputation as those classic brands like The Jade Mystery or Mingxing Jewelry, the quality of our products is definitely on par with theirs!

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Qiuyue: Take care! Come back anytime!

## Talk

Traveler: How's business?
Qiuyue: We're doing okay. After all, there is always demand for minerals no matter where you go.
Qiuyue: ...If there is demand, there is a market, and Liyue merchants will never miss a business opportunity!
Qiuyue: The only problem here is the Sakoku Decree. Our import channels were still affected by it in the end... Ah, it's such a headache.

## Talk

Traveler: About Rex Lapis...
Qiuyue: Do you mean the passing of Rex Lapis? I've already heard about that.
Qiuyue: When that incident took place, the lockdown of Inazuma had already happened, so I also missed the Rite of Parting.
Qiuyue: *sigh* I'm still a bit broken up about it. I'm sure every Liyue citizen would've grieved too...

## Talk

Traveler: How's business been?
Qiuyue: It's been great, recently. I mean, ore is always in demand, you know? And where's there's demand, there's a market, and we Liyue merchants will never miss a business opportunity!
Qiuyue: The other thing is the opening of the trade roads, which has resulted in increased channels and buyers alike.
Qiuyue: Once I scrounge up some more capital, I'm opening up a branch in Inazuma City!
Qiuyue: Gotta take advantage of the situation before someone sets themselves up as my competitor here, you know?

Traveler: Adventure Challenge

## Talk

Qiuyue: ...How could I let you get away with that... I need to think about it...

## Talk

Qiuyue: How about that? I'm unbeatable at Genius Invokation TCG!

## Talk

Traveler: I've seen the Rite of Parting...
Qiuyue: Wow! So you are the rumored foreign Traveler that assisted with the Rite of Parting!
Qiuyue: I apologize for my rudeness. As one of Rex Lapis' subjects, I need to properly show you my gratitude.
Qiuyue: Please accept my humble gift. Make sure you take it.
