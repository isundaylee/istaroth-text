Traveler: And just who is doing the ranking?
Hanquan: Me, of course. I've seen many martial artists in my time, so I've got confidence in my judgment.
Hanquan: Let me put it this way. There's an excellent martial artist named Huangshan who can be found on the trade routes linking Liyue and Mondstadt. She's barely a grade three.
Hanquan: Sun Yu, a Guhua Disciple, wields a swift and sharp sword, and he'd be a grade two.
Hanquan: A grade one, then, has to be an absolute master.
Hanquan: In my opinion, Branch Master Lan of the Adventurers' Guild would count.
