Traveler: C—Cannons? What sort?
Mécantre: The sort that'll blast cannonballs up into the skies! I intend to place the gun mount here, um... Well, maybe a bit farther away, but not too far.
Mécantre: After that, we'll have to draw up a restricted zone. When that cannon fires, the spherical blast wave is going to be quite strong.
Mécantre: We'll have to place the audience in suitable positions...
Mécantre: Such that they can view the firing without fear that their hats might get blown clean off.
