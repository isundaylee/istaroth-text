Traveler: About a guard's duties...
Maupoil: Oh, I don't have any complaints about working as a guard. I just wish people would be more diligent in their work, that's all.
Maupoil: Estienne in particular... I sometimes feel scared he's going to have another one of his so-called "bright ideas." If he has to have them, I wish he'd do it while I'm on vacation... a long vacation.
