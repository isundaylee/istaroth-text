# Vortex's Wake


## Talk 1

Zhongli: The ancient god probably left behind lots of elemental marks. Following them should make our search much easier.
Paimon: #Well, go ahead then, Traveler. Use your Elemental Sight to look for any marks.

## Talk 2

Wanyan: Argh! You're simply a money-grubber!
Kliment: And what are you then? All you think about is digging up valuable relics every day!
Paimon: They're still arguing? Ugh... let's not bother them...

## Talk 3

Kliment: ...You call yourself a scholar of archaeology? You can't even recognize this or that. What are you good for?
Wanyan: We all have our areas of expertise! I already tried very hard to explain!
Paimon: Stop arguing! What in the world happened?
Kliment: This girl just keeps bragging about how she's an archaeologist, but she doesn't even know anything about the surrounding ruins! I even know more than her!
Kliment: She left me to rely solely on guessing — I mean, experience — to find anything valuable to take back. Ugh, what a waste of time!
Wanyan: I—I've just been researching the God of Salt, so I'm not familiar with sea relics. Is that so strange!?
Traveler: (Hmm, it is a bit strange...)
Wanyan: And you! You kept asking about how much Mora everything is worth! Can the value of relics only be measured in Mora!?
Kliment: Uh... I mean, isn't measuring their value in Mora the easiest way? This also matches the traditions of Liyue, does it not?
Zhongli: Now, now, calm down, no need to make a fuss. We were able to bring back some intriguing objects. Let's have a look.
Zhongli: Oh...
Zhongli: What a shame. *sigh* These objects were indeed washed ashore by the Overlord of the Vortex, but they have nothing to do with the god besides being in the vicinity at the time.
Zhongli: This stone slab we found, however, has a mysterious pattern and faint aura of divine power. Perhaps it will be useful for research purposes.
Kliment: Quick, give it to me!
Kliment: Hehe, at least we didn't come for nothing. The power of the gods, yes! This is good... heh.
Kliment: Oh, but these other objects are certainly worth a little something, right? It should be enough to cover the cost of hiring you — it's all mine!
Paimon: So... it's only valuable for research if there are remnants of divine power on it?
Wanyan: Not at all. My quest to uncover the history of the God of Salt is because history can tell us about culture and beliefs...
Wanyan: But YOU... You're just trying to use archaeology to get rich!
Kliment: Nonsense! I'm a professional archaeology researcher from Snezhnaya, I swear. If I'm lying, may the Lord of Geo strike me down!
Traveler: (No, you're trying to get rich off archaeology...)
Zhongli: Oh, by the way. You probably don't want to sell that teacup.
Kliment: Oh, why's that?
Zhongli: That's not an ancient teacup. It's part of Ningguang's collection, it must have fallen here along with the Jade Chamber. So unless you want to mess with the Qixing...
Kliment: Ah, I see... What a shame. It was of such high quality, too.
Wanyan: See!? You do want to sell these objects!
Kliment: S—So what! Why can't I pursue wealth both intellectual and material? Don't be so simple-minded!
Kliment: Alright then! No need to stay here any longer. Hm, I'm rather quite intrigued by the God of Salt too, actually. Let's go to Sal Terrae next.
Traveler: (No, you're trying to collect the strength of the gods...)
Traveler: (One shouldn't lack general knowledge in their field...)
