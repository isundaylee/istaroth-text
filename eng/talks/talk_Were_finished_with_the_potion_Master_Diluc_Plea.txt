Paimon: We're finished with the potion, Master Diluc! Please give it a try!
Diluc: Oh? I thought you might need more time, but it looks like you've already found the solution. Nice job.
Black Screen Text: You hand over the potion to Diluc. After looking it over, he takes a small dose to test out the potion's effects...
Diluc: Wow, the effect is even more apparent than I imagined. Your many talents just keep on surprising me.
Diluc: On behalf of Dawn Winery, I would like to make a bulk purchase order for this potion. Oh, and don't worry about the delivery side of things. Elzer will send someone to pick up the potions once they're ready.
Diluc: My plan is to enlist the help of artisans to infuse candles and fragrances with the effects of this potion. Those products will serve as complementary gifts for customers to enjoy during wine tasting.
Lisa: So you plan to make alchemical potions part of the wine-drinking experience itself... Interesting. And very much in keeping with the Dawn Winery's way of doing business.
Traveler: Looks like our new product's a hit!
Paimon: If our potion was enough to impress Master Diluc, Paimon's sure regular customers are gonna be even more amazed!
Diluc: Well, there's still work to be done, so I should probably head out. It'll take some time before we know exactly what the commercial impact of this combination will be.
Diluc: In any case, it's been a pleasure working with you. Here's hoping our two businesses will have a long and successful partnership. I hope those orders will keep on rolling in... for both our sakes.
Diluc: Oh, and if you have some time, you should stop by Angel's Share to see your masterpiece in action.
Paimon: For sure! Paimon can't wait! Well, see you next time, Master Diluc!
Traveler: We just secured a huge order from Dawn Winery!
