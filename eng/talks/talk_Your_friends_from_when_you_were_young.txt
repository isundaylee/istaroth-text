Traveler: Your friends from when you were young?
Bhabha: I was an energetic and tireless adventurer in my youth. I may have gotten myself into my fair share of trouble, but that's also how I made friends.
Bhabha: I remember that lad Roald would lose things all over the place. I once lent him shoes, notebooks, and a mountaineering pickaxe... before he lost them all, that is.
Bhabha: And there was that chatterbox... Cyrus? Was that his name? He had a booming voice, liked to go on and on and on, but would never listen to what anyone else had to say...
Bhabha: I hear he's the branch master of the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild now, and that he's got a beautiful daughter.
Bhabha: I suppose that means he's grown up a fair bit now, that's good...
