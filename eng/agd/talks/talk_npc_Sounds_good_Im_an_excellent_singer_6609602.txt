Traveler: Sounds good, I'm an excellent singer.
Batz: Ah, then this must be fate! I've got a lot of records over at my place. I'll be sure to invite you if a concert comes up.
Batz: Actually, that reminds me... The People of the Springs are huge fans of music, too. Their music's a lot more laid back, though — kinda like the hot springs they're known for.
Batz: Our music is a lot more rhythmic in nature — you can even work with it playing in the background. Even Xilonen, the most famous engraver here, has borrowed my records a few times.
