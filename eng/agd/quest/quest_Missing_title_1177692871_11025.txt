Zhongli: I will remain here for a while. I fear that moments of reminiscence like this can only grow fewer.
Traveler: I feel a bit bad for the God of Salt...
Zhongli: We did not measure right and wrong during the days of the Archon War in the same manner as we do today.
Zhongli: Of course, as I am now... I only wish that she could have lived in a gentler time.
Traveler: Won't those relics cause Osial to grow in power?
Zhongli: Though the salt chalice and salt ruler do have power in their own right, they are nothing before Osial.
Zhongli: If a day comes when he should recover his strength and return... Ha, I believe that even so, he will be defeated once more.
Traveler: What will you do now?
Zhongli: That is a good question. In the past, I might have given you a most specific answer.
Zhongli: But now... Yes, I suppose I will continue in my role as a consultant at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
Zhongli: But if this journey was to your liking, why don't you come along the next time I am seeking to preserve memories of Liyue's past?
