Traveler: About Jirou...
Saimon Katsumi: He's been talking about wanting to tend to the fields... Oh well, I suppose it's not a bad thing.
Saimon Katsumi: He left home only to find that it's still better here. He's been through quite a bit, though I suppose it all ended well.
Saimon Katsumi: As for me, I'm getting old and I don't expect him to become something extraordinary. I'm happy as long as he's safe and leading an honest life.
