Traveler: There's still something I need to do.
Saimon Eri: There's no need to rush. You're a kind person. The kindness you've shown others will surely be repaid.
Saimon Eri: As for what my husband gave you, it'd be great if it can be of use to you. If not, well, then don't pay it too much mind.
Saimon Eri: Ah, it seems like I've got the same problem as that naggy old man, I hope you don't find me annoying.
Saimon Eri: Anyway, I hope you pace yourself and tread steadily. Slowly but surely, you will ultimately reach your goals.
