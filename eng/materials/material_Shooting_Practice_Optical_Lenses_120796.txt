# Shooting Practice Optical Lenses

An optical array provided by Special Security and Surveillance Patrol member Turenna. It appears to use some hard-to-grasp imaging techniques in conjunction with the sand table device from the "Thousand-Pace Interdiction Arcminute Sharpshooting Zone" to simulate using a musket to shoot at one's foes.
Though this is considered in many ways insufficient for actual Patrol members' training regimens, it is more than enough to drum up interest in muskets and musketry, in developing one's talents for such, and for using such gifts for good.
