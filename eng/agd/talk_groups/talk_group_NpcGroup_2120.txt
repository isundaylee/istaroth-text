Fugui: I'm telling you, good tea has a fragrant aftertaste which stays in your mouth. But bad tea? More like having a chunk of stone stuck in your throat...
Fugui: Oh, hello, what do you want? Are you here for a face reading, too?

Traveler: What's face reading?
Fugui: Not to brag, but I can tell everything about you just from one good look at your face! Your future fortunes, and also whether you're a good or bad person!
Fugui: These days I do face readings for passers-by, free of charge. So how about it, shall I do you now?
Traveler: Okay, let's give it a go.
Fugui: Awesome! Let me have a look.
Fugui: Hmm... Smooth forehead, square jaw, symmetrical features, beautiful eyes, healthy complexion...
Fugui: How strange... you've gone a little red in the face...
Traveler: It's called a radiant glow!
Fugui: ...Speaks from the diaphragm, perfect enunciation... You seem pure of heart to me. You're a good egg!
Fugui: ...And I can see that fate possibly has an enormous sum of money in store for you, but currently you're on track to miss out on it by a hair's breadth.
Fugui: So, don't chase after fleeting pleasures. Pull your finger out, knuckle down, and work hard. Your future will reward you for it. Got it?
Traveler: Took a blow to the face in a fight just now...
Fugui: ...Bit too symmetrical for a blow to the face if you ask me... but on the whole you don't seem like the bad type...
Fugui: ...And I can see that fate has a calamity coming your way, but as long as you work hard, keep doing the right thing, things'll work out for you in the end.
Fugui: So, don't set your sights too high, take opportunities when they come your way, and while you might not be destined for great success you'll have a happy and secure life ahead of you. Got it?

Traveler: Ever seen a face that looks a lot like mine?
Fugui: Ah, you've got the right man. I often do face-readings around these parts, and I've read a good many people, too. Let me have a look at your face...
Fugui: Hmm, let's see... Smooth forehead, square jaw, symmetrical features, beautiful eyes, healthy complexion, could you be...
Fugui: No, no... How could another person as striking and radiant as you exist?
