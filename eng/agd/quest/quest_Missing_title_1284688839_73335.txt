## Talk 1

Paimon: Not bad, Sorush! You really made the area regain its vitality real quick, huh?
Traveler: Pari powers are quite fascinating, yes.
Sorush: Of course, many Pari know how to bring Sunyata Flowers to life by heart.
Sorush: Simply put, even though the Sign of Apaosha has disappeared, this Sunyata Flower hasn't recovered from its corrosion and it's still extremely feeble...
Sorush: The other flower ponds are unlikely to be spared. This must be very upsetting for Sefana.
Paimon: This Sefana you mentioned must be a nice Pari who works hard to take care of the flowers!
Paimon: #Let's go help her, shall we, Traveler?
Sorush: For me, it's nothing too difficult, and it'll help out Sefana. My Yasnapati, please keep an eye out for these Sunyata Flowers.
Traveler: I'll tell you when I see them.
Paimon: Yup! Let's save these pretty flowers together!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Not bad, Sorush! You really made the area regain its vitality real quick, huh?
Traveler: Pari powers are quite fascinating, yes.
Sorush: You startle pointlessly! My powers are more than enough to easily rescue the Sunyata Flower!
Sorush: The dark corrosion expands yet, and these Sunyata Flowers are but one amongst its many victims...
Sorush: The other flower ponds have not been spared. Sefana must be in quite the fluster at this moment.
Paimon: This Sefana you mentioned seems like a nice Pari who works hard to take care of the flowers...
Paimon: #Let's go help her, shall we, Traveler?
Sorush: Well now, I suppose it may serve as a suitable diversion upon my great work. In that case, my Yasnapati, I bid you have a care for Sunyata Flowers of this kind.
Traveler: I'll tell you when I see them.
Paimon: Yup! Let's save these pretty flowers together!
