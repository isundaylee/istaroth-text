## Talk

Matsudaira: They're up against us, the Shogunate army, you know? Those inferior rebels aren't gonna hold out much longer, just you wait.

## Talk

Traveler: You appear to be very confident in yourself.
Matsudaira: Of course, our army is well-equipped and highly motivated. There are many veterans like me here who know how to fight wars.
Matsudaira: Those disorganized Sangonomiya militiamen lack discipline. Naturally, they are no match for us.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Matsudaira: Don't worry, you can trust me. I mean, how could the Shogunate possibly lose?

## Talk

Traveler: How's the war going at the moment?
Matsudaira: Well, about that... We've fought them so many times. Though they are inferior to the Shogunate army in terms of manpower and equipment, they are still relentless and are putting up a desperate fight.
Matsudaira: As for what we should do next exactly, we should probably follow the orders of the higher-ups. You can't just fight and kill all the time. Regrouping and recreation are also necessary aspects of war.
Matsudaira: Don't get the wrong idea. I'm not saying that because I'm afraid of them.
Matsudaira: All wars have their casualties. Even though we're on the winning side, there will still be unseen scars left on people.
Matsudaira: For a commoner like you, it's best that you stay far away from this hellhole.

## Talk

Traveler: Is there anything you can tell me about this area?
Matsudaira: What? Are you still thinking of traveling around here even though you know there's a war going on? You've really got guts...
Matsudaira: As you can see, Kannazuka is the location of the Shogunate camp. It's run by the Kujou Clan of the Tenryou Commission.
Matsudaira: Southwest of Kannazuka is Tatarasuna. Jade Steel, Inazuma's pride and joy, is produced there. However, there was an accident at the Mikage Furnace recently, so you probably should find a detour.
Matsudaira: If you keep heading west, you'll find yourself on Yashiori Island. That's where the rebel camp is. I've heard that those scoundrels were trying to hire more men. Don't you get taken in by them!
Matsudaira: Yashiori Island also contains the corpses of slain gods and demons. It's got that spectacular valley created by the Electro Archon with her serpent-slaying sword going for it, though! So if you do really travel there, you have to go pay that place a visit.
Matsudaira: I've heard about the Tatarigami running amok near those remains, though, so it's better that you don't go there!

## Talk

Traveler: So, about "Masanori" ...
Matsudaira: That guy is dead.
Matsudaira: He swordsmanship was top notch, and he and Kenji Kazumichi were both well-liked by our superiors. How could he just defect like that? I really don't get it.
Matsudaira: If it wasn't for this ridiculous incident, Kenji wouldn't have...
Matsudaira: Alas, poor Kenji. That kid shouldn't have become like that...

## Talk

Matsudaira: Have you heard? The Shogunate and Sangonomiya have agreed to a ceasefire.
Matsudaira: Looks like I'll finally get to go home soon...
Matsudaira: Haha, just kidding. It's just a short ceasefire. I doubt I'll be going anywhere anytime soon...

## Talk

Traveler: About the ceasefire...
Matsudaira: To be honest, I was relieved when I heard about the ceasefire.
Matsudaira: But don't get the wrong idea, though. It's not like I'm afraid of those small fry from Sangonomiya or anything. We're still the stronger party when it comes to military might by a long shot!
Matsudaira: It's just that I'm past the age where you're all hot-blooded and up for a fight, you know? I'm beginning to think that it's not good for people to remain on the battlefield for too long.
Matsudaira: But of course, that doesn't mean that I'll go easy on anyone in a real fight.
Matsudaira: It can still be pretty dangerous around here, ceasefire notwithstanding, so best you be careful.

Traveler: Is there anything you can tell me about this area?
Matsudaira: As you can see, Kannazuka is the location of the Shogunate camp. It's run by the Kujou Clan of the Tenryou Commission.
Matsudaira: Head southwest and you'll eventually reach Tatarasuna. Jade Steel, Inazuma's pride and joy, is produced there.
Matsudaira: If you go further west, that's Yashiori Island, territory of the Sangonomiya resistance.
Matsudaira: Yashiori Island also contains the corpses of slain gods and demons. It's got that spectacular valley created by the Electro Archon with her serpent-slaying sword going for it, though! So if you do really travel there, you have to go pay that place a visit.
Matsudaira: I've heard about the Tatarigami running amok near those remains, though, so it's better that you don't go there!
