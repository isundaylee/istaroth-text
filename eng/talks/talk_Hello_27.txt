Keon: Oh, hello.
Keon: Travelers, merchants, and adventurers frequent Gandharva Ville... But your footsteps are more agile than theirs. You must be a lively and lovable youngster.
Keon: That's a good thing, and very rare to come by in Sumeru right now.
Keon: Young traveler, may the Greater Lord watch over you.
