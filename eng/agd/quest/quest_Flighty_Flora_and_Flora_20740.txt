# Flighty Flora... and Flora


## Talk 1

Flora: Would you like to buy some flowers? I'm afraid you've come at a bad time...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Flora: A lot of the flowers in my shop were blown away by that huge wind from before.
Flora: Not only were the flowers on display outside blown away, but so were some that I had left near the storefront.
Flora: I still have a fair bit of stock, but the flowers put on display are the prettiest ones. A lot of customers are attracted by them.
Flora: Now, these flowers have been blown away, and I still need to clean up the store, so I won't be able to find time to pick new ones...
Flora: Traveler, if you're willing, could you help me pick some fresh flowers?

## Talk 2

Traveler: Leave it to me.
Flora: Great! Still, you might need to pick quite a few...
Flora: Let me see... First, please help me pick one sweet flower and one small lamp grass from the Whispering Woods.
Flora: Then go to Windrise, and get me one windwheel aster.
Flora: Finally, help me pick a Cecilia from Starsnatch Cliff.
Flora: Please come back as soon as possible once you have them. If they wilt, they can't be displayed at the storefront.

## Talk 3

Traveler: Sorry, I'm busy right now...
Flora: Alright then. I'll go get some myself once I can find the time.

## Talk 4

Traveler: About those flowers...
Flora: Did you finish getting the flowers?
Traveler: Got 'em right here.
Flora: These are all so fresh... Thank you. With these flowers out at the storefront, we're sure to attract a lot of customers.
Flora: If I could make another small request... the wind also blew all the dandelions we had away.
Flora: Although dandelions being carried away by the wind isn't a bad thing...
Flora: But it still seem strange for a florist's in Mondstadt to not have dandelions.
Flora: Dandelions can't just be plucked and brought back â€” they have to be regrown from scratch.
Flora: So could you help fetch a batch of Dandelion Seeds for me?
Traveler: I'll do it.
Flora: I'm counting on you, then. I recall that there are lots of dandelions just outside Mondstadt.
Traveler: Where should I start looking?
Flora: There are lots of dandelions outside the city. You should be able to get them easily.

## Talk 5

Traveler: So, about those dandelions...
Flora: Have you managed to get the dandelions?
Traveler: I have them.
Flora: Thank you. This should be enough. I'll sow the seeds into these pots...
Flora: ...Along with those flowers that you found for me earlier.
Flora: Ah, yes. I have to thank you, don't I? This is a little token, please take it.
Flora: Now, I have to quickly put these flowers inside these pots here. Then the dandelions seeds go there...

## Talk 6

Flora: Oh, right. The Dandelion Seeds have only just been sown, so there's nothing in the pot... I guess I'll have to take them off display for the time being.
Flora: Ah, I really hope they grow up soon...

## Talk 7

Traveler: About those flowers...
Flora: You can find small lamp grass and sweet flowers in the Whispering Woods. Windrise is where you'll find windwheel asters, and you can find cecilias on Starsnatch Cliff.
Flora: You can definitely get the freshest flowers from these areas.
Flora: Once you've finished picking them, please bring them back to me as quickly as possible.

## Talk 8

Traveler: So, about those dandelions...
Flora: Dandelions can be found just outside Mondstadt, but I have to clean up the shop, and simply don't have time to leave...
Flora: So please, help me gather a batch of Dandelion Seeds.

## Talk 9

Flora: And we're done. Hehe, doesn't this look like a proper florist's now?
