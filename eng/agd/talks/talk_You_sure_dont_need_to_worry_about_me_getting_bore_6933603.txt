Yoimiya: You sure don't need to worry about me getting bored here. I'm spoiled for choice with all these books! I hardly know where to start!
Yoimiya: I want to memorize all the interesting parts, so I can go back and tell them to my friends!
Yoimiya: Oh, right, that's another thing I meant to ask! Which of these books do you recommend? I want to know what kind of stories you're into!
