Traveler: What's the matter?
Huachu: Oh... I'm fine. It's just my first time away from home and I'm still getting used to it.
Huachu: Even the tea here tastes different from what I'm used to...

Traveler: Who are you?
Huachu: Oh yes, sorry... I am the second daughter of the manager of the Minghua Company. Today, exceptionally, I have taken an excursion.
Huachu: But with this being my first excursion ever, I am struggling to adapt.
Traveler: Just the two of you?
Huachu: Yes... Out of consideration for the business, I limited myself to a single travel partner.
Traveler: Where are you going?
Huachu: Apologies, that information is company confidential.

## Talk

Traveler: Have a wonderful excursion.
Huachu: And the same to you.
