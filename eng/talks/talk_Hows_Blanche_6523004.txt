Traveler: How's Blanche?
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": She's good. I found her a tutor before coming in. Heehee, can you guess what kind of tutor? Photography!
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": I've told the tutor to fill her world with pictures every day, all of beautiful scenery from exotic locales abroad. This way, she's bound to want to visit them someday.
"Tricky Bulle Fruit": And in the future, she won't be so against the idea of going overseas to study.
