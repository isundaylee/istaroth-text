# Talk Dialog

Sucrose: Hm, your movements are quite practiced, and your potion meets the requirements as well. Congratulations on passing the Beginner exam!
Paimon: Hmph, that was a piece of cake!
Traveler: It had its challenging moments.
Sucrose: Even so, it was no match for your skills.
Sucrose: Alright, I believe I've collected all the necessary feedback... Looks like we'll have to make some adjustments to the level of difficulty for the actual exam.
Sucrose: #I'm going to head back to the lab now. See you later, {NICKNAME} and Paimon!
Traveler: That was nothing.
Sucrose: Wow... I really thought it would be more difficult for someone so new to potion-making.
