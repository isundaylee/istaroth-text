Pauline: We sell all sorts of fresh flowers and plants here — looking to buy a few bouquets?
Traveler: And you are?
Pauline: Greetings, Honorary Knight!
Pauline: Perhaps you don't recognize me...
Pauline: But I'm a resident of Springvale, and I run a small flower shop.
Pauline: I'm always busy looking after the flowers and plants, so I haven't had any dealings with visitors from outside the town in a long time...
Pauline: I never thought I'd meet a celebrity like you this year. Perhaps it's good luck brought by the returning wind?
Traveler: Flowers and plants?
Pauline: I'm a keen gardener — the plants you see here? I grew them all myself. They're less common varieties that are purely ornamental.
Pauline: My hope is that such beautiful plants will lift everyone's spirits.
Pauline: However, because of their seasonal nature, I can only open for business at certain times of the year.
Traveler: Bye.
Pauline: Goodbye, have a nice day!
