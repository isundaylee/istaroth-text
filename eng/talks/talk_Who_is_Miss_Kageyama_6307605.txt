Traveler: Who is Miss Kageyama?
Ebina Gonshirou: You don't even know who Miss Kageyama is? I don't think you should be in Ritou!
Ebina Gonshirou: Miss Kageyama is an inspector at the Outlander Affairs Agency who is in charge of entry permits for outlanders like you.
Ebina Gonshirou: If you still wish to remain in Inazuma, you'd better get those documents and gifts prepared before visiting the inspector!
