# Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas: One Hundred Sights of Dihua


## Talk 1

"Kichiboushi": Ooh. The sea here is pretty.
Paimon: Eh? Dihua Marsh isn't a sea.
Traveler: Its waters are connected to the sea, though...
Paimon: Hmm, that's true... but it still feels wrong to call Dihua Marsh the sea.
"Kichiboushi": Mm... Not really understanding. "Sea" and "Not the Sea," what's the difference?
Traveler: The taste of the water?
"Kichiboushi": Ooh! Forest water is a bit sweet, so not the sea!
Paimon: But if Cider Lake is full of cider, what would it count as...?
Traveler: Something Venti would truly love.
Paimon: That issue aside, though. Is it just Paimon, or is Kichiboushi getting better at speaking?
Traveler: According to what Ioroi said before...
Paimon: What did Ioroi say again? "I am the renowned bake-danuki, Ioroi"... Uh, no, that's not it...
Paimon: "Ooh... I do so wish to scratch mine belly." "Oh...!" Hmm, that's not it, either.
"Kichiboushi": Mmhaha, Paimon good at imitator. Very funny!
Traveler: "As we get more used to Kichiboushi's aura..."
Paimon: Oh yeah, that's right! The more used we are to Kichiboushi's aura, the better we'll be able to understand him!
"Kichiboushi": #And training, mm! Kichiboushi going with Traveler and Paimon, learning lots of new things!
Traveler: Paimon's a good guide, eh?
Paimon: Oh...
Paimon: #You remember all that from back then, huh, Traveler? That's nice of you...
"Kichiboushi": #Mm! Thank you, Paimon and Traveler.
"Kichiboushi": This "is-or-isn't-a-sea" is very pretty. The tall, tall house behind it is very pretty too. Help Kichiboushi taking a photo?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Traveler: Companions who adventure together, grow together.
"Kichiboushi": Mm! Companions.
Paimon: The best of companions!
Traveler: Ioroi did say something about this before we left...
Traveler: The sea is a large-scale water body beyond the mainland.
Paimon: Wow, that's... a rather strict definition. But that brings us back to the question of "boundaries," right?
"Kichiboushi": #Traveler says Dihua Marsh is connected to sea. So the difference between "land-land" and "not-land-land" is?
Paimon: ...Guess your strict definition isn't solving our problems, huh?
Traveler: These concepts are all man-made constructs. They don't have inherent meaning.
Traveler: If Dihua Marsh thinks it's a sea, then it's the sea.
"Kichiboushi": So Kichiboushi thinks to be an adeptus, so is an adeptus?
Paimon: #Hey! Don't listen to {F#her}{M#him}, Kichiboushi. What in the world are you talking about, Traveler?
Paimon: But though it was kind of messy, you had a good point. You can become any kind of bake-danuki you wanna be, Kichiboushi! Who knows, you might even become a tanuki adeptus!
"Kichiboushi": A tanuki adeptus! Yey!

## Talk 2

Paimon: And it's done!
Paimon: Next up...
Paimon: How about this? Kichiboushi, have you ever gone fishing?
"Kichiboushi": Fishing?
Paimon: Looks like you haven't. Alright then, let's head for the water's edge!
"Kichiboushi": Yey!

## Talk 3

"Kichiboushi": Ooh... Why...
Paimon: Come on, Kichiboushi, why did you just charge straight into the hilichurl stronghold?
"Kichiboushi": Thought we could... play...
Paimon: Eh? Why? The hilichurls are dangerous monsters...
Traveler: Now, I wouldn't call them dangerous...
Paimon: Come on! Kichiboushi isn't anywhere as seasoned a combatant as you!
Traveler: Hmm, when we first met in Chinju Forest...
Paimon: That's right! Weren't you hiding in the form of some other object while being surrounded by hilichurls?
"Kichiboushi": When we first met... First met... I'm thinking... Ooh, yes.
"Kichiboushi": Then, was playing Hide-and-Seek with the hilichurl. Forest hilichurls do not attack bake-danuki. They play with us often.
Paimon: Eh? So you've developed a harmonious relationship?
"Kichiboushi": Not knowing why the hilichurls here are like this. Mmm...
Paimon: Either way, you need to be more careful out here. Even when it comes to hilichurls... Well, especially when it comes to the hilichurls...
Paimon: #Ugh, this is getting complicated. You explain, Traveler.
Traveler: You need to differentiate between the good people and the bad.
Paimon: Yup! That's how you can protect yourself in the future.
Traveler: But don't forget to keep a good and open heart.
Paimon: Yup, that's right! That'll help you enjoy the good things in life!
"Kichiboushi": Mm...
"Kichiboushi": #Traveler and Paimon say complicated things. Kichiboushi not understand.
"Kichiboushi": But Kichiboushi knows you're good people. So Kichiboushi learn.
Paimon: #Alright, enough of that for now. For now, time to learn how to fish from Traveler.
"Kichiboushi": Mm! Fishing!
Traveler: Aye, they're truly perilous!
Paimon: Hey, there's no need to scare him either!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Haha, this place looks pretty good.
"Kichiboushi": Kichiboushi wants to play with water!
Paimon: Hey, hey, not now! You'll scare the fish away!
Black Screen Text: You teach Kichiboushi the basics of fishing.
You try to keep things simple, but as to how much he understands...
"Kichiboushi": Fish!
Traveler: Got it?
"Kichiboushi": Mmhaha! Fish are silly. Get tricked by food!
Traveler: Huh, that sounds like Paimon!
Paimon: Hey, come on!
Paimon: Well, everyone likes gourmet food!
Paimon: #Well then, Traveler, time to show Kichiboushi what you can do!
Traveler: You're not so different, Kichiboushi.
"Kichiboushi": Mm?
Traveler: That happens to me too.

## Talk 5

"Kichiboushi": Really to play with the water.
Traveler: Not now, you'll scare the fish off.
"Kichiboushi": Mm. Okay.

## Talk 6

"Kichiboushi": Hmm. Why not go into water to catchy fish?
Traveler: Some fish can't be caught that way.
Paimon: That's right! Fishing is a great way to train!
Traveler: You try, Kichiboushi.
"Kichiboushi": Mm?
Black Screen Text: In the end, Kichiboushi is the one to try fishing.
As expected, he doesn't catch much of anything.
In the end, the three of you give up fishing and play by the water instead.
Paimon: Being damp at all kinda sucks, but it was pretty fun to play in the water!
"Kichiboushi": Kichiboushi is very happy! But fishing is hard.
Paimon: #Yup. But if you do learn to fish, you might make some unexpected friends some day. Right, Traveler?
Traveler: That's true.
"Kichiboushi": Hard to understand... But Kichiboushi understands.
"Kichiboushi": #Playing with Traveler and Paimon is very fun. Traveler and Paimon are Kichiboushi's good friends.
"Kichiboushi": Training is great!
Paimon: Oh yeah, speaking of which, Ioroi's goal was to take Kichiboushi to eight places to train...
Paimon: Dragonspine, Guyun Stone Forest, Mondstadt, Liyue Harbor, Mt. Hulao... We've finished most of your training already!
"Kichiboushi": Mm, that's true...
Paimon: So where should we go next?
Traveler: I'll leave that decision to you.
Paimon: #Ooh, that's not something Paimon hears from you often, Traveler!
Paimon: Alright, then! Leave this to Paimon!
"Kichiboushi": Leave it to Paimon, mm!
Traveler: Yes, though food expenses might increase as a result.
Paimon: Come on!
Traveler: You try, Paimon.
Paimon: The fish would pull Paimon right into the sea!
Traveler: It might be quite troublesome, but it's more interesting this way.
Traveler: This is also a form of training.
