Turenna: Super Zenith Boss-Level Force, do you have any further instructions?
Traveler: Let's play a round of "Thousand-Pace Interdiction Arcminute Sharpshooting Zone"!
Turenna: No problem! This game doesn't use up any real ammunition, and the targets don't require maintenance, so you can play as many rounds as you like!
Traveler: About muskets...
Turenna: Oh, interested in a custom-made musket of your own?
Turenna: Though I couldn't tell you exactly how muskets work myself, I do recall hearing colleagues mention the names of several outstanding gunsmiths.
Turenna: In terms of their lifespan, accuracy, and ballistic stability, there's simply no comparison between a mass-produced musket and one that has been painstakingly crafted by a gunsmith...
Turenna: And if you're using high-quality ammunition, produced to very tight tolerance levels, then get ready for some jaw-dropping results!
Turenna: But I seem to remember that regular citizens aren't allowed to carry muskets, at least not without having first cut through an absolute sea of red tape...
Turenna: Tell you what, when I return to the Special Patrol headquarters, I'll ask around for you!
Traveler: See you around!
Turenna: Nice to meet you again, Super Zenith Boss-Level Force! I'll be here waiting for you, drop by whenever you'd like!
