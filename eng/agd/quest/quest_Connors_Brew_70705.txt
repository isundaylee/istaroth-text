# Connor's Brew


## Talk 1

Traveler: A little bird told me that someone wants Mist Flower Corollas...
Connor: Ah, you must have seen that commission of mine. So, do you have those three Mist Flower Corollas handy?
Traveler: Here they are.
Traveler: Not yet.
Connor: Please hurry, then. I'm due to use them to brew up some wine.

## Talk 2

Connor: My, my... These Mist Flower Corollas are of fine quality indeed.
Connor: Please, take these â€” consider them a token of my appreciation.
