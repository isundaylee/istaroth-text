# Chaos Bolt

Comes from a now-inactive ancient Ruin Drake.
Among the lost ancient kingdoms, there was a group of people who were obsessed with the idea of mimesis. Be it the Hypostases' pure ordered elements or the ancient primitive power of the dragons, these people believed that they might all be replicated and modified to the point where they had surpassed their natural counterparts.
By this means, a superior and unsullied bodily form could replace the continuously decaying and shattering order.
