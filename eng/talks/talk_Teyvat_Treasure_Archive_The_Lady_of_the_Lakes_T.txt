The Steambird Culture and Arts Section: "Teyvat Treasure Archive: The Lady of the Lake's Tear"
The Steambird Culture and Arts Section: The Lady of the Lake's Tear is a special custom timepiece designed by the owner of Lepaute Horlogerie, Caron, for none other than Lady Furina herself. The name itself, The Lady of the Lake's Tear, springs straight from the golden mouth of Lady Furina.
The Steambird Culture and Arts Section: The defining feature of this timepiece is the teardrop gemstone, so dainty and delicate that it wouldn't look out of place on a ring, and the custom-made mechanical core specially designed by Monsieur Caron himself.
The Steambird Culture and Arts Section: The core of the Lady of the Lake's Tear is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, a masterpiece without parallel in Fontaine's clock technology. It is destined for a place in the history of both art and the greatest collections of the future.
