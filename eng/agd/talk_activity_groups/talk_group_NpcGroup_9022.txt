## Talk

Venti: #You've come at long last, Traveler!
Venti: While I was waiting for you, I nearly finished penning quite a few poems.

## Talk

Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Venti: It's great, of course.
Venti: I know that every detail here is the result of your hard work. I hold immense gratitude for all you've done.
Traveler: If you like it, I'm happy.
Venti: Yes, I love it!
Venti: Oh, I'm flattered that you asked for my thoughts.
Venti: But you should be more confident in your own tastes!
Venti: Here, you're the real-deal protagonist!
Venti: Try things with confidence and turn your ideas into reality. And if you ever run into trouble, I'll lend a helping hand!
Traveler: Is there anything you want?
Venti: This place already has everything I want!

## Talk

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Venti: Okay! Ahem... My dearest companion, is there something you wish to tell me?
Traveler: Actually, I've been pretty tired lately...
Venti: Hee-hee... My warrior, you've worked so hard.
Venti: I understand how you feel.
Venti: ...When you just can't find any more energy, and the world falls into a haze — even apples lose their sweet flavor.
Venti: If you can get some quality shut-eye at this time, you'll feel a lot better when you wake up.
Venti: Here, I'll lend you my shoulder.
Venti: Eh-hehe...
Venti: At any rate, don't worry.
Venti: Whenever you need me, I'll always be by your side.
Traveler: I feel a bit lost...
Venti: Hmm...
Venti: Many people may feel lost at times. After all, it's impossible for everything to happen according to your own wishes.
Venti: At a time like this, ask yourself what the most important thing is!
Venti: Even if life's all in a jumble, you can sort it out as long as there's a whisper of the wind.
Venti: ...Don't be afraid, I'm here.
Traveler: Your serious face... is a rare sight.

## Talk

Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Venti: Hmm... *gasp* Let's hold a feast!
Venti: Call up your good friends and I'll contribute a bottle of the finest wine from my collection!
Venti: As for the location...
Venti: Let's just have it here! We can find a clear space and decorate it with benches, a porch, and beautiful fresh flowers!
Traveler: So... what's the theme of our celebration?
Venti: Uh, we need a theme? Then hold on, lemme think of one.
Venti: Uh... "Cheers!" Eh... "Pop!" No... I got it! "Wishes for Happiness"? How's that?
Venti: Oh, yeah! Can I trouble you to prepare one of your specialty dishes?
Venti: Anything's fine — I like to eat any dish you make!
Traveler: Heh, sounds like it'll be quite a merry time.
Venti: Oh, yeah~ It'll definitely be lively.
Venti: Alright, then let us officially start the preparations!
Venti: What a joyous day... It calls for a drink to celebrate.
Traveler: Hmm... I feel like it'll be chaotic.
Venti: Hee-hee, making cheer from chaos is a staple of feasts!
Venti: Don't worry, I'll properly organize it.
Traveler: I'll also help out.
Traveler: Will you put on a show for us?
Venti: Sure! I'll sing along to a suite I haven't played in a long time.
Venti: Any songs you wanna hear? I can practice a bit beforehand. Of course, this won't take up much time.

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Venti.
Venti: #Morning, Traveler, hehe.
Venti: Going anywhere to play today? There are a lot of places I wanna visit — need a recommendation?

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Venti.
Venti: #Aw, I don't want to sleep yet, Traveler.
Venti: Wanna keep me company a bit longer? Or... I'll keep you company?

## Talk

Venti: Ah... the park is one of the most pleasant places in the city.
Venti: Most people taking a break there are relaxed and in pretty good spirits, so they're always willing to listen to a song or two.
Venti: Eh-he~ let's work together to make this park even more beautiful!

## Talk

Venti: Whoa! This orchard smells wonderful! The apples must be super big and juicy!
Venti: And these bunches of grapes weighing down the dense vines... *sigh* They'll become delicious wine one day...
Venti: Why don't we... sample some of these future wines? Hehe, it can't hurt to enjoy them a little. Come on, open wide~
