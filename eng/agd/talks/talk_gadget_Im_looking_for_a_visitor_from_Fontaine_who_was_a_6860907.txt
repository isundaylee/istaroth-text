Missing Person Poster: "I'm looking for a visitor from Fontaine who was asking about hot springs on the Visitors' Message Board — the one who mentioned something about 'melting,' or 'dissolving.'"
Missing Person Poster: "I originally invited him to join me on a trip to an outdoor hot spring via this message board, but he never responded, and I'm worried he's gone missing. If anyone has any information about what might have happened to him, I would greatly appreciate it if you could let me know."
