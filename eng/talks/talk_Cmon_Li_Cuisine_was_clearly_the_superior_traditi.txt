Huihui: C'mon, Li Cuisine was clearly the superior tradition this time at Masterful Chefs!
Hao: Oh sure, that sounds like something only Li lovers would say!
Huihui: Well, why don't you just accept that there's nothing redeemable about Yue Cuisine? Did you see that boiled fish dish in the qualifiers? Made that judge's face turn green just from tasting it! You could smell the rank flavor of soil from a mile away...
Hao: Wâ€”Well, it's not like Li Cuisine fared any better. I heard that one of the judges failed to show up at the finals because they got a tummy ache from tasting some Li Cuisine during the semi-finals!
Huihui: Nonsense! A tummy ache's got nothing to do with the dish's taste. Li Cuisine is just superior!
Hao: Hmph, you're clearly only saying that because you've never properly tried Yue food before. I bet you've never even BEEN to the Xinyue Kiosk!
Huihui: And I bet YOU have never had proper Li cuisine at Liuli Pavilion!
