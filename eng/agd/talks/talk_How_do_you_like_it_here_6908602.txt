Traveler: How do you like it here?
Wriothesley: Hmm, I quite like the environment. The temperature and humidity are both near perfect. It's a very fitting place for a leisurely vacation.
Wriothesley: You really are quite something, to possess such a cozy and comfortable haven, but still be willing to venture out into the unknown.
Traveler: There are some things that I must do.
Wriothesley: You speak with conviction. I can tell those matters are extremely important to you.
Wriothesley: It's not a bad thing to be committed to a goal. It can prevent you from losing your way in life.
Wriothesley: But don't let your convictions control you and lead you down a dangerous path, okay?
Wriothesley: After all, this wonderful place is still waiting for your return.
Traveler: Life is all about being on the move.
Wriothesley: Huh, I like the sound of that phrase. I just might write it down and add it to one of the regulations at the Fortress of Meropide.
Wriothesley: Should I say that it came from you?
Traveler: Nope, that responsibility's all yours.
Wriothesley: Ahh, you saw right through me.
Wriothesley: Don't worry, though. I was just joking around.
Wriothesley: If I was actually going to add some new kind of rule, I will be sure to take full responsibility for it.
