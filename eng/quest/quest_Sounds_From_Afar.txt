# Sounds From Afar


## Talk 1

Paimon: Razor's usually around Wolvendom, right?
Paimon: Uh, how do you think he'll react after hearing about this?

## Talk 2

Paimon: Look, there's another trap up ahead! And can you feel that Electro energy, too?

## Talk 3

Paimon: The Electro traces lead deep into Wolvendom. Let's keep going.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Raaazooor...! Are you there?

## Talk 5

Draff: Alright! The last trap has been set. Razor, thanks for coming with me all this way.
Razor: It's okay. My legs are strong. ...Hmm?
Draff: What is it, Razor?
Razor: *sniff* It smells... familiar. Friend, from far away.
Paimon: Razor!
Paimon: Oh, and it's Draff, too! Are you two hunting together?
Draff: Yes, it's almost harvest season, and the boars are venturing into the towns and wineries looking for food.
Draff: They're trampling crops and destroying the vineyards. Someone could get seriously hurt.
Draff: The Knights of Favonius came to us asking for help keeping the boars a safe distance away from the population.
Razor: I and Uncle Brown Cat, catch boars, protect everyone.
Paimon: Wow, Razor, this is a big step for you! Paimon remembers you used to hide away from the hunters.
Draff: Hehe, you can say that again! Razor was the star of the show this time. He let the wolves know we'd be coming, so we were able to get through Wolvendom without anyone getting hurt.
Razor: Helping everyone, helping lupical, makes me happy. But... much talking. Very tired now.
Traveler: Still, it's a sign of progress.
Paimon: Yeah! But, um... Actually, we came here today because we have some really important news...
Black Screen Text: You tell Razor about Varka's letter...
Razor: Oh...
Razor: I... don't know.
Paimon: Razor... Do you mean, you don't want to know about your real parents?
Razor: I want to know, but... don't want to know.
Paimon: Uhh... So you do wanna know, but at the same time, you don't wanna know? Sounds complicated...
Draff: Traveler, come and take a look at the trap I just placed. Let's give Razor some space to process things.
Traveler: What is it?
Draff: Yes, I have some thoughts about all this after seeing how Razor reacted.
Draff: We've been hunting together a lot recently. The kid might not talk much, but still, I feel like I've come to understand him a little over the time we've spent together.
Draff: Here's what I think... He definitely wants to find out about his parents. It's just that his fear of the unknown is overwhelming everything else he's feeling.
Draff: I'm a father myself, so I know a thing or two about kids.
Draff: You know, when Diona was little, if I got back late from a hunt one night, she'd be watching me like a hawk for days afterwards, as if she was worried that I might abandon her.
Paimon: Do you mean Razor's worried that he was abandoned by his own parents...?
Draff: Exactly. I think that's the heart of it. And if it turns out they did, well, I don't think there's anything we could say to console him. That's not my only concern, though...
Draff: Razor is developing at his own pace. There are lots of issues that can't be solved all in one go, but he's making progress, one step at a time.
Draff: But now this thing with his parents is added into the mix... It might push him to want to figure out once and for all where he comes from and where he's going.
Paimon: Seems like a similar take to Lisa's. Maybe all mature adults think like this, huh?
Paimon: Wait, but then again... Master Jean had a different view. She said it's more about trusting other people and in your own instincts!
Paimon: #Uhh... Traveler, what do you think?
Traveler: He'll have to face this sooner or later...
Draff: Gotcha. Well, knowing that he's got a friend like you to rely on makes me feel much better about this whole thing.
Traveler: Paimon, how about this:
Black Screen Text: You tell Paimon about how you plan to approach the situation...
Paimon: Okay, got it! Right, let's head back. We don't wanna keep him waiting.
Paimon: Hey, Razor... So, what are your thoughts?
Razor: Still thinking... My heart, it feels strange... like being stabbed by Wolfhook.
Traveler: What do you think of Varka?
Razor: Varka? Hmm... Tall, very strong, likes to laugh.
Traveler: Then... do you trust Varka?
Razor: Yes. Trust.
Razor: ...He's very good to me. Give me a name, teach me to fight. But now... busy with important work... I miss him.
Paimon: You know, Razor, Varka used up all the paper writing this letter, but he still made sure he found room on the back to add a note for Lisa. He specifically told her to give you the things that your parents left for you...
Paimon: That means that he thinks the items have a special meaning for you.
Paimon: #But more importantly than that... Whatever happens, Traveler, Paimon, Lisa, and all your other friends will always be here for you.
Traveler: Don't worry, everything will be fine.
Draff: That's right! And old Uncle Brown Cat's here to support you as well.
Razor: ...Okay. Thank you. I decide... I want to go with you, to see teacher.
Draff: Haha, that's the spirit, kiddo!
Draff: Well, you folks had better be heading off, then. I'm just about finished here, so I'll be heading home very shortly myself. I'd better try and get plenty of father-daughter time in before the Weinlesefest starts, hahaha...
Paimon: Bye, Draff, see you again next time.
Traveler: I will be there for him as a friend through this...
Traveler: Seems like you have something to say.
Traveler: I'm happy for you.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Lisa, we've brought Razor.
Razor: Hello, Teacher. I'm here, to see the box.
Lisa: Ah, my little wolf cub's in a good mood. I'm assuming they've discussed the whole story with you already?
Lisa: Here, this is it, the wooden box. I haven't touched it, except for taking it out of the cabinet. When you're sure you're ready, you can open it yourself.
Razor: Yes, I am sure.
Razor: *click*
Paimon: Oh... This is just a pile of junk. Paimon thought there'd at least be a letter, or something.
Paimon: Uh oh, you don't think that... after all this time, Varka might be getting mixed up between different boxes?
Razor: *sniff* There is a scent.
Paimon: A scent? What kind?
Razor: A scent I remember from a long, long time ago. It's... their scent.
Razor: Human scent... Father and mother's scent.
Traveler: ...
Lisa: Incredible... You still remember scents from all the way back in your childhood.
Paimon: Wow, you really have a good sense of smell, Razor. Guess being wild by nature has its advantages... Let's see what other leads we can find!
Paimon: Hmm, this woolen hand puppet looks kinda wonky. Guess it must be handmade, huh... Is this a part from a Ruin Guard?
Paimon: Wait... Hey, look, this wine bottle is still half full!
Paimon: And there's a note stuck on it: "Thousand," uh... "Thousand-Wind Wine."
Lisa: Oh? So it's a bottle of Thousand-Wind Wine?
Razor: Teacher, you know?
Lisa: Of course. Thousand-Wind Wine was the first kind of wine that Mondstadters ever learned to make, or so they say.
Lisa: As to how it got its name, some say it's a reference to the numerous ingredients used to make it, while others say it's because every bottle tastes slightly different.
Lisa: I remember reading somewhere that there are all sorts of weird and wonderful ways of brewing it, and that it's very difficult to ensure it comes out tasting the same each time.
Lisa: This all makes it impractical to commercialize. Wine merchants are much more comfortable working with reliable, consistent-tasting products.
Lisa: That's why you'll almost never see Thousand-Wind Wine in the markets or taverns.
Lisa: In fact, it looks like your parents brewed this bottle themselves.
Paimon: That must mean there's something pretty important about it... Ooh, Paimon has an idea! Razor, you've got a good nose. Why don't you open it up and take a whiff? Maybe it'll tell you something!
Razor: Okay.
Razor: ...
Paimon: Huh, he seems really in the zone... and is that a smile?
Lisa: Find anything?
Razor: Sweet, cold, a little bitter... I like. Many things, all mixed together.
Razor: But, things in wine, smell different...
Paimon: Even you can't tell what it is, Razor?
Razor: I will try again.
Razor: ...
Razor: Hmm...
Lisa: It's okay, Razor, don't push yourself too hard. What do we do when we try something and it doesn't work?
Razor: Try... another way.
Lisa: That's right. You still remember what I taught you.
Lisa: It's almost the Weinlesefest. Everyone who knows anything worth knowing about wine will be gathering in Mondstadt. Surely someone will know a thing or two about Thousand-Wind Wine.
Paimon: Ohh, great idea!
Traveler: (Will Venti be coming...?)
Lisa: Make sure you don't miss the opening ceremony, cutie. Everyone will be there. Razor, you should go too â€” it'll be a good opportunity to ask around.
Razor: Okay. Ask many people... I will try.
Paimon: Don't worry, we'll be right there with you. We can be your go-betweens. You know, like you were with the wolves, for Draff!
Traveler: Interesting comparison...
Razor: Okay. Then, I will go back now. I need to tell lupical about human mother and human father.
Paimon: Great! See you at the opening ceremony!
Traveler: We'll be there with you. Just like we promised.

## Talk 7

Jean: Thank you, everyone, for your patience. I am pleased to announce that this year's Weinlesefest has officially begun.
Jean: We hope the residents of Mondstadt and visitors from all over will enjoy the magnificent wines and experience the joy of the harvest.
Jean: When Windcoming Day arrives, we will hold a grand toasting ceremony to welcome the Anemo Archon, Barbatos, back home.
Jean: Let the Wind lead!
Bernhard: Let the Wind lead!
Paimon: Razor! You're here already.
Razor: Mmm... So many... people...
Paimon: Come on, let's sneak outta here. There's someone we gotta find!
Razor: Find? Who?
Paimon: Just some tone-deaf bard. But he's also a know-it-all and loves nothing more than drinking, so he might actually be able to help.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Hey, Tone-Deaf Bard!
Traveler: It's been a while.
Venti: #Traveler, Paimon, how do you do? Haha, I had a feeling I'd run into you soon, during this most enchanting of festivals.
Paimon: Spoken like a true poet... Hmm, but reading between the lines here â€” if one bottle is tipsy, and two is merry, just how many is "enchanting," exactly?
Venti: Hahaha, oh, don't say that. This festival has so much more to offer than just drinking.
Venti: Anyway, hey, Razor! How have you been?
Razor: Alright. I have... a question.
Paimon: Yeah, Razor has something he wants to ask you about. Know anything about Thousand-Wind Wine?
Venti: Ooh, now there's a name that takes me back. Let me think... how long has it been since I last heard someone mention Thousand-Wind Wine?
Paimon: Razor's parents left him a box with a half-bottle of wine inside, and there's a label on it that says "Thousand-Wind Wine."
Paimon: We heard there's a lotta history behind this type of wine, and the brewing methods go way, way back, so we figured you'd be a good person to ask.
Razor: It smells good, but... don't know, what's inside.
Venti: I see, I see, so you want to know how Thousand-Wind Wine is made? Well, you came to the right person. I happen to know a little rhyme called... well, as it happens, "Thousand-Wind Wine."
Venti: I was going to save it for Windcoming Day, but far be it from me to deny an early serenade to a friend in need. How about it? Shall I recite it for you?
Razor: A song... Not easy to understand, but still want to hear.
Venti: Excellent answer. Then, ahem, hear it you shall:
Venti: "Fill up the barrels and store them away,
Then wait, wait for a windier day.
Wax the bottles, seal them tight,
For the south wind that soothes, for the north wind that bites."
Venti: "How does this fine wine taste to the tongue?
As 'Mondstadt' to the ear: like a sweet dream of freedom.
And what are the fruits that went into the brew?
An explorer's courage, a love tender and true."
Venti: "A defender's will, strong as yesteryear,
Joining the thousand winds in a song of good cheer,
Turning sour into sweet, bitter notes fade away,
As we wait, wait for a windier day."
Venti: Hehehe, thank you so much for the applause. Was the rhyme of help to you?
Razor: Like wine. A little sweet, but now, head spinning. Don't understand.
Paimon: Don't worry, it's not just you! That was supposed to be about wine-making, but it didn't give a single detail about the process!
Venti: Haha, well, maybe it's a little abstract and romanticized, but that's one of the defining features of Mondstadt poetry.
Paimon: Okay, so let's try to pin this down. What did the poem say the ingredients are? Hmmm... Ummm...
Paimon: An explorer's courage, a love tender and true, a defender's will, and... the thousand winds'... "song of good cheer"...
Paimon: Nope, Paimon has absolutely no idea what any of these refer to!
Paimon: Look, Tone-Deaf Bard, you clearly know what the whole thing means, so could you do us a favor and at least give us a hint?
Venti: You misunderstand me. I'm not trying to make you work for it or anything, but the lyrics are what they are. If there's anything they left out, even I can't fill in the blanks.
Venti: If you want to know the secret behind this sweet scent, you might have to start by rolling up your sleeves...
Paimon: Rolling up our sleeves...? You mean, we need to go and make this wine for ourselves, and somehow that'll teach us everything we wanna know? ...This better not be a prank!
Venti: We've known each other for so long, and you still don't trust my intentions? Oh, the pain...
Razor: ...I trust. I... want to try.
Razor: I want to... make wine, and find answers.
Razor: If I know how to make wine, then I know what is in father and mother's wine.
Traveler: By reliving their actions, maybe we will understand...
Razor: Right.
Razor: I want to... know about them.
Paimon: Well, if you say so, Razor. Guess we'll have to take Tone-Deaf Bard's word on this one. We'll give it a try, and as first-time wine-makers, there's no shame if it turns out bad!
Venti: Don't worry, really. Freedom is the key here. It's not as hard as you might think.
Venti: As long as you add ingredients to the mix in a spirit of joy and sincerity, I promise you will reap the rewards you wish for.
Razor: ...
Razor: I will tell poem to teacher.
Razor: Then... I need to think alone.
Paimon: That's the spirit. So, how about we meet again in two days? Let's say same place, right here?
Razor: Okay. I will remember. See you, then.
Traveler: ...what kind of people they were.
Traveler: So nice to see you again.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Lisa: As his teacher, I have a duty to give him the best education and guidance that I can. I'll make sure I'm prepared by the time you get back.
Lisa: Go on now, cuties. I'll leave Razor in your hands.

### Additional Talk 2

Jean: #Traveler, is there something else you would like to discuss?
Traveler: About the expedition...
Jean: It was good of Mika to bring the letter back all this way. Knowing that everyone is safe and sound is the best encouragement I could ask for.
Jean: Still... I hadn't counted on The Captain making an appearance.
Jean: The Grand Master has a rather... unconventional way of describing things, but even then... I've never heard him give such high recognition to anyone before.
Jean: #Traveler, if you ever encounter The Captain on your own journey, be on your guard. He is not someone to be underestimated.
Traveler: About Mika...
Jean: Mika tells me that rather than rejoining the expedition party, Grand Master told him to return to his post in Eula's Reconnaissance Company after delivering the letter.
Jean: Land surveyors are usually situated in the vanguard of an army on the move, and are tasked with exploring previously uncharted territory. It looks like the expedition must have entered into a much less intense phase...
Jean: Have you had the chance to speak with Mika yet? When he's with people he hasn't met before, he tenses up and stands bolt upright...
Jean: I really wish he had a little more self-confidence.
Traveler: About the Weinlesefest...
Jean: There is still some preparation to do, but don't worry. Everything's on track.
Jean: Actually, while we're on the topic, I have an assignment I'd like to give you, namely:
Jean: Enjoy the festival to the fullest. Any objections?
Traveler: Goodbye.
Jean: Goodbye. I wish you a very pleasant Weinlesefest.

### Additional Talk 3

Mika: Ah! Uh, hâ€”hi there, umm... You must be looking for Captain Kaeya...? Please, don't mind me!
Traveler: Actually, I was looking for you.
Mika: Huh? Wait, but... whaâ€”!? Oh geez, Captain Kaeya... Whâ€”What should I say?
Kaeya: Haha, oh, Mika... How have you not changed one bit after being out on the front line this long?
Kaeya: You were just asking me about the Stormterror incident, weren't you? Well, allow me to introduce you to the legendary Honorary Knight.
Paimon: That's right! And also the legendary Paimon!
Mika: Hâ€”Hi there, you guys are so strong, I'm... I'm in awe. Um... I have to go and report in with Captain Eula now, please excuse me!
Black Screen Text: Mika leaves the Knights of Favonius in a hurry...
Paimon: Aw, he just left... Well, that's too bad. Paimon was gonna ask him all about the expedition.
Kaeya: That is a pity, it really is. But don't take it the wrong way. The way he sees it, every pair of eyes in Mondstadt is focused squarely on you.
Kaeya: Give it some time and this'll all sort itself out. Next time you see him, I'm sure you'll get along just fine.
Kaeya: In fact, let me share a little secret with you: Try talking to him about exploring the wild. You'll win his trust in no time.
Traveler: I just wanted to say hi.

### Additional Talk 4

Kaeya: Well, what do you think? Glad you tagged along this time?
Kaeya: A little birdie told me that you'll be staying in Mondstadt for the Weinlesefest? Hope you enjoy yourselves.

### Additional Talk 5

Bernhard: Can you believe the expedition party ran into The Captain of the Fatui? Whew... what a relief that nothing came of it.
Fynn: What's there to be afraid of? The Grand Master is there. One Grand Master should be able to take on at least, like... 10 Captains.
Fynn: Wait, forget that â€” you shouldn't be worrying about the expedition when you've got the Knights of Favonius charity fundraising booth that you're supposed to be organizing. So? How's it coming along?
Bernhard: *sigh* Actually... I still haven't really decided what to sell...

### Additional Talk 6

Allan: Oh, hi, Traveler. Back in Mondstadt for the Weinlesefest, huh? Well, watch out for boars if you're out exploring the open country.
Paimon: Hey, it's Allan, Draff's apprentice! Um, have you seen Razor? You know â€” the young guy who lives in Wolvendom?
Allan: Razor? Wait, who's that again... Oh! You mean the guy who goes hunting with Draff? I haven't actually seen him today.
Paimon: Okay... Well, there aren't any traces of Electro around here anyway. Let's try somewhere else.

### Additional Talk 7

Lisa: As Razor's teacher, I'm so happy to see him taking this first step.
Lisa: And you must be tired from running around trying to find Razor. Why don't you rest here a while? I'll make you a nice cup of tea.

### Additional Talk 8

Venti: Ah, good. I was hoping we might get to chat some more.
Traveler: Can I hear the poem again?
Venti: You need a refresher? Okay, I'll perform the first half again.
Venti: "Fill up the barrels and store them away,
Then wait, wait for a windier day.
Wax the bottles, seal them tight,
For the south wind that soothes, for the north wind that bites."
Venti: "How does this fine wine taste to the tongue?
As 'Mondstadt' to the ear: like a sweet dream of freedom.
And what are the fruits that went into the brew?
An explorer's courage, a love tender and true."
Venti: "A defender's will, strong as yesteryear,
Joining the thousand winds in a song of good cheer,
Turning sour into sweet, bitter notes fade away,
As we wait, wait for a windier day."
Traveler: What are your thoughts on the Weinlesefest?
Venti: I am fond of each and every one of Mondstadt's festivals, but if I'm honest, Weinlesefest has an extra-special place in my heart.
Venti: You know, the Anemo Archon goes into a slumber after the west wind dies down, leaving the north wind to blow during the winter.
Venti: Which means, this festival is the big feast before the winter slumber!
Traveler: About Razor...
Venti: I wouldn't worry yourself too much about him.
Venti: Staying true to their journey and discovering joy and freedom for themselves is what Mondstadters do best.
Venti: The same goes for you. You have to find the thing that makes you happy. Haha, mostly because your happiness is very important to me.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Venti: See you around. Remember, there's no rush. Take your time, and you'll find all the answers that you're looking for.
