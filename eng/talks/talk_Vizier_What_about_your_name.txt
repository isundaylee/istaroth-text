Traveler: Vizier? What about your name?
Nizam: My name is Nizam, and Vizier is my title. I'm responsible for administrative matters in the Grand Bazaar and Treasures Street on behalf of the Akademiya.
Nizam: ...At least, that's what the official document says.
Nizam: In reality, I mostly deal with trivial matters. Anything the Mahamata don't want to deal with gets passed on to me...
Nizam: Said something about electing a new Grand Conservator, and things having gotten busier... Just another excuse.
