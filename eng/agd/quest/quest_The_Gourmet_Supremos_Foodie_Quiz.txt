# The Gourmet Supremos: Foodie Quiz


## Talk 1

Parvaneh: This recipe should be like this...
Traveler: What are you doing?
Parvaneh: I'm sorting recipes out. Unfortunately, I can't remember some of them clearly...
Traveler: Why not ask Xudong?
Parvaneh: Xudong... He and his "creative dishes" are the main reasons why I can't remember them.
Parvaneh: Every time he gets hold of a new recipe, he'll only follow the recipe for a day or two at most.
Parvaneh: Then, he... tries various things to improve them.
Traveler: Why would he do that?
Parvaneh: According to him, it's to make them less expensive... But I'm not quite sure why he did all that...
Parvaneh: But anyway, the results speak for themselves. He was indeed successful.
Parvaneh: The taste is similar to the original, but the production cost is ridiculously low.
Parvaneh: His outrageous cooking methods are the reason why I was willing to work with him. And I think the reason he was willing to take me on is because of my skills.
Traveler: So, what do you want me to do for you?
Parvaneh: Ah... whoops! I was so busy talking about Xudong that I almost forgot the topic at hand...
Parvaneh: Xudong has been pestering me to change the recipes. He would write and draw directly on them... As such, some recipes have become hard to read.
Parvaneh: I want to recover those recipes accurately and save a copy in case a proper one is needed.
Parvaneh: Traveler, if you still remember them, could you help me out?
Traveler: No problem.
Parvaneh: Thanks. So I'll sort out the messed-up recipes, and you can correct the unclear parts...
Traveler: Of course. I've been eating my way across Teyvat.
Traveler: Your skills?
Parvaneh: Haven't I told you? My research topic at Akademiya is the "ultimate seasoning."
Parvaneh: Simply put, I mean to create a super seasoning that can make any food delicious.
Parvaneh: That's the reason I'm out here to collect information on various cuisines.
Parvaneh: Ahem, I've gone on too long. Let's get back to the recipes...
Traveler: How exactly would he improve them?
Parvaneh: Well... his way is different from others. Most chefs try to make the recipe richer so that the dish can be sold at a higher price.
Parvaneh: But Xudong seems to have a completely different principle...
Parvaneh: For example, he used potatoes, mushrooms, and some other cheap vegetables to make a vegetarian dish which somehow tasted like Jueyun Chili Chicken...
Parvaneh: There is also this simplified version of Adeptus' Temptation made with Potatoes, Rice, Lotus Head, Jueyun Chili, dough, and Raw Meat. The texture and taste are somehow similar to the original dish...
Traveler: Wait. Aren't you The Gourmet Supremos?
Parvaneh: Please don't mention that name to me again. These words will never appear in my paper...
Parvaneh: Besides, Xudong and his "creative dishes" are the main reasons why I can't remember these recipes.

## Talk 2

Parvaneh: There is a dish called Northern Apple Stew in Mondstadt. Ugh, Xudong wrote down a bunch of nonsense here again...
Parvaneh: "Butter is expensive and raw meat is hard to store. Why not knead the dough, wash out the gluten, steam the gluten, and season it with fruits and vegetables to give it a savory taste?"
Parvaneh: This fellow... How is butter expensive? And why not just buy fresh meat?
Parvaneh: Never mind... Traveler, what I want to ask is "besides Apples, Butter, and Raw Meat, what else is in Northern Apple Stew?"
Traveler: Almonds.
Parvaneh: Hmm... is that so? Let me write it down first...
Traveler: Pepper.
Parvaneh: Hmm... is that so? Let me write it down first...
Traveler: Jueyun Chilis.
Traveler: Ham.

## Talk 3

Parvaneh: There is a famous dish called Tianshu Meat in Liyue, let's see... Uh, Xudong scribbled something here, too...
Parvaneh: "Steam peeled potatoes, mash while hot, add oil and salt. Then put it in a bowl and pour a thick gravy on top. The first bite is just like soft meat."
Parvaneh: The first bite... does that mean you can tell after a few more bites? Come on, that will only fool those who have never had genuine Tianshu Meat...
Parvaneh: Forget it... Traveler, what I want to ask is: "besides Raw Meat, Sugar, and Matsutake, what else is in Tianshu Meat?"
Traveler: Violetgrass.
Parvaneh: Hmm... is that so? Let me write it down first...
Traveler: Qingxin.
Parvaneh: Hmm... is that so? Let me write it down first...
Traveler: Snapdragon.
Traveler: Calla Lily.

## Talk 4

Parvaneh: In Liyue, there is a dish called Bamboo Shoot Soup. It's supposed to be very delicate...
Parvaneh: Xudong... he changed this one too...
Parvaneh: "Chop Snapdragon and boil it with Mushrooms. Add Salt and Sugar. The soup will taste like Ham."
Parvaneh: Who would cook these things together!? And even if the soup tasted like ham, it's not as if there would be any in there!
Parvaneh: Forget it... Traveler, what I want to ask is: "Besides raw meat, what else is in Bamboo Shoot Soup?"
Traveler: Bird Eggs.
Parvaneh: Hmm... is that so? Let me write it down first...
Traveler: Fish.
Traveler: Matsutake.
Traveler: Bamboo Shoots.
Parvaneh: Hmm... is that so? Let me write it down first...

## Talk 5

Parvaneh: There is a dish called Tri-Flavored Skewer in Inazuma... ever since Uncle Munehisa taught Xudong this dish, he's been working hard on it...
Parvaneh: I can't believe he made so many notes...
Parvaneh: "'Skewer' is such a wonderful word. Any ingredient can be skewered on a stick..."
Parvaneh: What exactly does he want to skewer... Oh, forget it! Traveler, what I want to ask is: "besides Raw Meat, Flour, and Snapdragon, what else is needed for Tri-Flavored Skewer?"
Traveler: Bird Eggs.
Parvaneh: Hmm... is that so? Let me write it down first...
Traveler: Tomatoes.
Parvaneh: Hmm... is that so? Let me write it down first...
Traveler: Milk.
Traveler: Bamboo Shoots.

Parvaneh: Well, thank you. I've written them all down now. I just hope that Xudong won't mess with them again.
Traveler: Why would he do that?
Parvaneh: Xudong only said that he wanted to make dishes cheaper.
Parvaneh: I don't understand him at all... but he's really good at what he does.
