Traveler: How do you like it here?
Baizhu: My way of living differs slightly from those of others, but please don't worry about it.
Baizhu: I've brought everything that's important to me. After all, it's a doctor's responsibility to take care of themselves first and foremost.
Traveler: What kind of items?
Baizhu: Ah, just a few things for my personal use. I'm not in the best physical condition, and have to take my medicine as soon as something begins to flare up. That's why I carry a medicine box wherever I go.
Baizhu: Apart from the medicine, there are also quite a few bottles and jars in my possession. They're heavy and take up a lot of space, so I didn't bring too many of them along.
Traveler: Feel free to bring anything you want.
Baizhu: Thank you, but there really is... a lot.
Baizhu: You're the owner of this place, and I don't want to take excessive advantage of your hospitality.
Baizhu: Ugh, look at him, mincing his words and trying to be polite. Let me explain.
Baizhu: If you ask me, "a lot" is a grave understatement. You wouldn't believe how many of those jars there are.
Baizhu: It'd probably take more than one empty room for everything to fit. Think twice before you say yes!
Traveler: Iâ€”It's fine.
Baizhu: Hmm... Let me write up a list then. I'll ask Gui to bring them over.
Baizhu: You seriously think he'll be able to carry everything on his own? Even if he got Qiqi to help, it'd still be impossible to bring them all in one go.
Baizhu: Perhaps I should take a trip back to the pharmacy to pack everything up, and have them delivered a few boxes at a time...
Traveler: Just how much stuff do you have?
Baizhu: Sorry. I'm a bit of a hassle to deal with...
Traveler: I have more than enough space to spare.
