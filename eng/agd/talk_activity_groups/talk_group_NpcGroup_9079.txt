Dehya: I'll admit it's cozy here, but there's not a whole lot to do... I'm already getting bored...
Dehya: #Oh? Look who finally showed up. Any chance you've got an exciting gig for me, Traveler?

## Talk

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Dehya: Haha, beats living in the desert. No crazy temperatures, no howling gales, no sandstorms...
Dehya: Plus, you don't have to keep an eye out for monsters popping out of the ground or vultures swooping down from the sky.
Traveler: Is life in the desert that rough!?
Dehya: There's no getting around these things if you wanna survive out there.
Dehya: You also can't forget to keep your guard up in case of troublemakers...
Dehya: Whoa, what's with that look on your face? Scared stiff?
Dehya: Relax, you've got me. Just bring me along the next time you go to the desert, and I'll handle everything for ya.

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Dehya: Gladly, beats standing here twiddling my thumbs.
Dehya: Hmm... Hey, do you know about the siltwater lakes in the desert?
Traveler: Are they like the ones at Sobek Oasis?
Dehya: Uh, not exactly.
Dehya: Siltwater lakes usually appear farther inside the desert. According to some very tall tales, they're believed to be Al-Ahmar's blessings.
Dehya: Legend has it that when his followers got lost in the desert, Al-Ahmar would command the underground rivers to rise to the surface, forming lakes for the trapped to quench their thirst...
Dehya: But it's just an urban legend.
Dehya: The water in siltwater lakes does originate from groundwater, but it's too bitter to be used for drinking.
Dehya: Besides, these lakes only exist for a short time before they're buried by sand, so you can't use them as landmarks.
Traveler: So do they have any purpose?
Dehya: I heard that the Adventurers' Guild did once receive a commission related to siltwater lakes.
Dehya: As for what the commission was about... I guess some outlanders who were visiting Sumeru wanted to visit the desert and see these lakes for themselves.
Dehya: So, they hired a group of experienced Guild adventurers to escort them through the desert.
Dehya: After that... Well, some say the Adventurers' Guild has never accepted similar commissions ever since.
Traveler: Other than being treated as tourist attractions...

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you want to do?
Dehya: You mean here? Uh, I can't think of anything in particular...
Dehya: If I had to pick something, I guess I'd like to explore this place thoroughly.
Dehya: I mean, this is my first time inside a teapot. I doubt anyone would believe me if I told them.
Traveler: What do you usually do in your spare time?
Dehya: Maintain my weapons, check my next job, sneak in a quick nap.
Dehya: If there's still time to burn, I'll grab a few drinks at the city tavern, but I usually don't have that much free time.
Traveler: Being a merc isn't easy...
Dehya: That's life for ya. Everyone's stressed out one way or another, and there's no escaping it.
Dehya: Even more so for mercs — we're looking for our next job before we even finish our current one.
Dehya: With so many competitors in this line of work, laziness will only net you an empty stomach.
Dehya: Hahaha, okay, enough serious talk. Days off are few and far between, so it'd be a waste not to unwind while I still can.
Dehya: Hmm... Why don't you show me around and introduce me to the others here?
Dehya: Especially that little bird named Tubby. Looks like she has her own teapot, what's up with that?
Traveler: You're overworking yourself...

## Talk

Traveler: Morning, Dehya.
Dehya: You look like you're raring to go. Not surprising, given how comfy this place is. I slept like a log last night.
Dehya: I usually get woken up by random loud noises, so it was a surprise to wake up naturally this morning. To be honest, it's quite an unfamiliar experience.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Dehya.
Dehya: Time for you to turn in already? Off you go, then. I'll be looking around some more.
Dehya: I know you said it's perfectly safe here, but to go to bed without someone on lookout... I don't think I'm used to that yet.

## Talk

Dehya: Mercs camping in the wild rely on banners and weapon racks to protect themselves.
Dehya: Normally, any reasonable merc will know to keep their distance when they see another group's banner.
Dehya: However, if a not-so-reasonable person insists on approaching, that's when the weapon racks come in handy.

## Talk

Dehya: Did you really shove an entire kebab shop in here? It's got everything: tools, equipment, even a table and chairs.
Dehya: Since you've got everything ready... I say, let grill master Dehya take it from here.
Dehya: What? I can't hunt any of the animals here? Okay, fine. Then I'm gonna head out and find some fresh meat.
