Albedo: Hm? Oh, it's you. Taking a walk around these parts?
Traveler: Do you want to chat?
Albedo: Okay. What would you like to discuss?
Traveler: About how you felt riding a dragon...
Albedo: I have conducted all manner of research, but flying from Mondstadt to this island on a dragon... That was a first.
Albedo: It was a good experience. In the sky, just speaking requires you to muster all your strength since the winds are so strong.
Albedo: Opportunities to communicate loudly with others are scarce. Although I have little interest in it, the process was interesting.
Albedo: I suppose this can be considered an unforgettable memory.
Traveler: Tell me about these islands...
Albedo: The nature of this island is extraordinary. Like a sealed-away secret, it opens only at specific times.
Albedo: And yet, the island still contains traces of human activity.
Albedo: Additionally, a plethora of organisms are present here.
Albedo: Ever since we arrived, I've been thinking: What is the limit to life? Even in the most desolate of places, will some form of life exist?
Traveler: Tell me about yourself...
Albedo: Me? I'm doing quite well here. Thank you for your concern.
Albedo: How do you feel here, if I might ask?
Traveler: Pretty good.
Albedo: Okay, that's good to hear.
Albedo: There are many landscapes worth drawing here. If you'd like to see, you may accompany me.
Traveler: About what happened today...
Albedo: Today's events didn't feel that out of the ordinary.
Albedo: Hmm? Sorry, do you mean when I left by myself?
Albedo: That was a personal choice. Don't stress over it. Sometimes, I like to be alone.
Albedo: Communicating with others can be a taxing affair, but if I were to choose someone to talk to, I would pick you.
Albedo: You're intelligent, and I like to talk to intelligent people.
Traveler: I won't disturb you.
Albedo: Alright, good night.

Albedo: Please, don't look at me like that.
Albedo: If we'd solved the riddle at the beginning, then the game wouldn't have been much fun now, would it?
Albedo: This archipelago suits you... and Klee.
Albedo: Don't you think so? Summer, islands, ocean... even if it is essentially just an ocean playground. It's perfect for those on the move.
Albedo: You could spend a wonderful summer here.
