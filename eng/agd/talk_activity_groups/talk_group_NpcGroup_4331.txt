Zadith: There are so many Darshans in the Akademiya... Which one should I choose?

## Talk

Traveler: What's troubling you?
Zadith: *sigh* I'm worrying about which Darshan I should choose in the Akademiya.
Zadith: My results were far better than I ever expected, so I met the requirements of all Darshans. But that brings me to another problem, there are six of them...
Zadith: I heard becoming a doctor after graduating from Amurta pays very well, but then others say that it's easier to get employment after studying architecture in Kshahrewar...
Zadith: Which one should I choose?

## Talk

Traveler: See you.
Zadith: *sigh* I wouldn't be this conflicted if I met the requirements of only one Darshan...

Traveler: Go to a fortune teller.
Zadith: Hahaha, you're really funny!
Zadith: ...You were kidding, right?
Zadith: No matter how difficult it may be, it's an important choice about my future career.
Zadith: If I make the wrong choice, I may drop out like Arezo, or never be able to graduate like Hosseini.
Zadith: I cannot end up like that!
