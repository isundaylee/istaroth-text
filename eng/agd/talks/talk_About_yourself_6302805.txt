Traveler: About yourself...
Hajime: Me? I'm just a regular apprentice swordsmith. I do whatever my master tells me to do.
Hajime: As you can see, I practice forging every day, earn a meager salary, and listen to my master's endless lectures...
Hajime: Although I'm the senior disciple, I'm not sure if the master's really counting on me to take over the Amenoma Art.
Hajime: ...Well, whatever. It's not a bad idea, as long as I get paid more.
