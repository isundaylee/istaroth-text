Curiously flavored fruit juice made from a variety of ingredients. The sour Cacahuatl, the fibrous Grainfruit, the bitter Quenepa Berries, and the gooey eggs... They battle for attention on your taste buds, but you can't drum up the patience to let them finish. You desperately need a glass of water to wash it all down.
