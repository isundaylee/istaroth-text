Traveler: Sha-what-yya?
Raef: Oh? Are you interested?
Raef: According to legend, they are a group of people who dwell in the depths of the desert.
Raef: Some say that they were not on good terms with the Akademiya, and thus fled deep into the desert to avoid them.
Raef: Others say that they are an investigation team sent into the desert by the Akademiya.
Raef: As for the details, I'm not very sure, but it's all hearsay. No one has ever seen them.
Raef: But between you and me, I do hope that this legend is in fact real. It would be nice to see them and hear their tales from far away someday, you know?
