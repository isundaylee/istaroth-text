# Wanderings of a Lonesome Shadow


## Talk 1

Tired Villager: The ruins? Don't know anything. We were only hired to deliver water and supplies to them.
Tired Villager: Forget excavation — they won't even let us get close to the camp where they're staying.

## Talk 2

Curious Villager: This area used to be ravaged by frequent sandstorms, but it's been calm lately for some reason...
Curious Villager: They say that this was done by a single traveler? But seriously, is such a thing even humanly possible?

## Talk 3

Chatty Villager: That machine looks amazing! Could it be the legendary Ruin Wanderer?
Chatty Villager: The location seems to fit too... Might that legend actually be true?

### Additional Talk 1

Karkata: Kolu...
Faruzan: Who knew that I'd encounter a mechanical life form in this manner after a hundred years?

### Additional Talk 2

Collei: I didn't know mechanical life forms could get sick, too... You have to get better soon, Karkata!

### Additional Talk 3

Tighnari: A "Fully Automated Irrigation System"... That's quite the task.
Collei: Master, can I help with anything at all? I can go buy things, prepare pen and paper...
Tighnari: Oh, you know, I seem to remember that you have a lot of homework today.
Collei: Huh? O—Oh, yeah, I do...
Tighnari: Well, hurry up and finish it so you can sleep early, or Faruzan will worry. That's the best thing you can do now to help.
Collei: Oh... Okay...
Karkata: Kolu...

### Additional Talk 4

Bakr: Halt! Mr. Raed's permission is required to proceed any further!

### Additional Talk 5

Raed: There's a tent that the villagers occasionally use to rest. Like I said, it's a bit simple, yes, but I hope you won't mind.

### Additional Talk 6

Raed: Ah, sorry for disturbing your rest. I'll tell my subordinates to be quieter in the future.

### Additional Talk 7

Machine Wreckage: (The wreckage of the huge machine remains motionless...)

### Additional Talk 8

Faruzan: (Faruzan's head hangs low in silence... The desert breathes gales of wind, and the only sound that can be heard is the scattering rise of spreading grains.)

### Additional Talk 9

Karkata: Kalu! Kalu!
Collei: It looks fine, but even so, it needs to properly rest up.

### Additional Talk 10

Tighnari: Faruzan went out after repairing Karkata. She seems to be looking for you for some reason.
Tighnari: ...Well, I will not probe any further. However, if you need any help, do feel free to ask.

### Additional Talk 11

Tired Villager: Ugh... So we still can't go back to Aaru Village?

### Additional Talk 12

Curious Villager: Just what are they digging for?

### Additional Talk 13

Chatty Villager: That huge machine looks amazing!

### Additional Talk 14

Yellowed Note: "...Tamimi's remodeling is going smoothly. As it is now, it can learn how to deal with various dangerous situations in the ruins on its own. I wish you could see it with your own eyes."
Yellowed Note: "As I worked, I kept thinking that you'd do a better job at this than I could."
Yellowed Note: "After all, you're the most exceptional student I've ever met."

### Additional Talk 15

Neatly-Penned Note: "Dear Madam Faruzan..."
Neatly-Penned Note: "The notes and manuscripts we found on Tamimi have been transcribed and organized, and every one of them has been marked with your name."
Neatly-Penned Note: "I hope that even after a hundred years, future generations of students will still remember your name, Madam Faruzan."

### Additional Talk 16

Oft-Corrected Note: "... I told you not to... Now, look... So many people... Worried... Even... Tamimi..."
Oft-Corrected Note: (The messy scribbling has been repeatedly canceled and edited, leaving barely legible phrases and a single neat message at the back.)
Oft-Corrected Note: "Hurry up and come home for a meal. Your mom always makes an extra portion of food, you know?"

### Additional Talk 17

Karkata: Kolu...
