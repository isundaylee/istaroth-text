Takuya: ...
Traveler: Wait, aren't you...
Takuya: *cough* That's right, I'm the Blue Oni descendant who was arrested in that previous incident. I didn't expect to meet you again under these circumstances.
Takuya: A kitsune lady came to the Police Station the other day, saying that an oni-related incident had come up, and that I might have the chance to make amends for my crime.
Takuya: But as it turned out, everything had been taken care of before I could even arrive... and I see humans and youkai staging such a grand festival together...
Takuya: ...Could it be that she just wanted me to see with my own eyes that both youkai and oni are already getting along with humans just fine...?
Takuya: *cough* Anyway, help me keep this outing of mine a secret, alright? Especially from that Crimson Oni descendant.
Takuya: He'll start pestering me to join the Arataki Gang again... which is a decision I'd rather put off until my sentence ends and I've spent some time living as a free man... I mean, oni.
Traveler: He'd go to the Police Station to look for you if he had to.
Takuya: ...On that count, I guess you'll just have to keep a better eye on him.
