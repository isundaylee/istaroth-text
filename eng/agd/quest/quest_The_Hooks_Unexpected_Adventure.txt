# The Hook's Unexpected Adventure


## Talk 1

Helbet: Please try the new bait again, Mr. Kayvan.
Kayvan: I've done that so many times, but the results are just the same as before!
Paimon: Huh? Why are the two of you fishing together again?
Kayvan: Traveler, we meet again.
Helbet: Hello, you two.
Traveler: Have you found out why the fish refuse to take the bait?
Kayvan: Haha! Nope. A researcher and I tried methods like modifying the fishing rod, adjusting the bait, and improving our techniques.
Kayvan: We tried so many different bodies of water and angles... I even tried fishing in a pond full of fish.
Kayvan: But no matter what I did, I could only fish up things that aren't fish.
Helbet: Don't worry, Mr. Kayvan. Didn't that researcher promise to keep researching? He'll definitely determine the reason behind all this for us.
Helbet: See, he even designed a new bait for you, and he wants me to stay here with you and record every detail about your fishing process down...
Kayvan: I hope he really succeeds... But until then, I'll just continue fishing my way.
Kayvan: If you would, Traveler, could you get me some more material for bait?
Traveler: Did you learn anything from the researchers?

## Talk 2

Traveler: What kind of materials do you need this time?
Kayvan: Let me think... I'll use Padisarah this time.
Kayvan: An ordinary one will do.

## Talk 3

Traveler: What kind of materials do you need this time?
Kayvan: Let me think... This time, I need Fresh Harra Fruits for my bait.
Kayvan: There's a place somewhere that has pretty good Harra Fruits. I'll mark it out on your map...

## Talk 4

Traveler: What sort of materials do you need this time?
Kayvan: Let me think... This time, I need... Uh... a Special Sweet Flower.
Kayvan: There's a place with pretty good Sweet Flowers. I'll mark it out on your map...

## Talk 5

Kayvan: The bait this time requires Sunsettia, Wheat, and Padisarah. Did you get them all?

## Talk 6

Kayvan: Not bad. Now, it's time to fish. I'm gonna catch a big one this time!
Black Screen Text: Kayvan prepares the bait and begins fishing...
Black Screen Text: Kayvan catches a wet package a short while later...
Helbet: Uh... Let me have a look...
Helbet: Huh? The things in here... They seem like lost items again...
Traveler: As expected of you.
Helbet: Uh... We've been fishing ever since Mr. Kayvan and I went to that researcher to modify our bait...
Helbet: But Mr. Kayvan still fishes up strange things every single time.
Helbet: Including lost items, ore from the bottom of the river, packages that fell off ships...
Helbet: Even some adventurer who accidentally fell into the water once grabbed onto Mr. Kayvan's fishing line to get out of the water...
Helbet: But we just can't catch any fish...
Kayvan: My fishing career has come to its end...
Helbet: M—Mr. Kayvan! Cheer up! L—Look, the owner of this thing is definitely anxious.
Helbet: He'll definitely be overjoyed that you fished it up.
Helbet: We may even be compensated when we take these lost items back to the Adventurers' Guild!
Kayvan: But... I really! I really just want—
Kayvan: I really just want to catch a fish!
Traveler: "Again"?
