# Talk Dialog

Chiori: Ah, it's you. Is there something I can help you with?
Traveler: About Chioriya Boutique...
Chiori: Interested in our couture services? Just give me the word.
Traveler: But we didn't really do anything...
Chiori: There's no need to be humble. You helped Xavier and Chevreuse, and even Kirara's told me many good things about you. They are all my friends.
Chiori: Thanks to you, we were also able to premiere the film in time. Its success has increased the reach of my brand.
Chiori: You've done far more than what you give yourself credit for.
Traveler: About your work...
Chiori: I am merely a fashion designer. I don't have anything else I moonlight as.
Chiori: But when you run a business, it's inevitable that as you make more friends, you'll also encounter all sorts of thorny issues.
Chiori: You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. It's just the common sense of business.
Traveler: I don't have any more questions.
Chiori: Okay, see you around.
