Traveler: About Ways to Make Friends With Saurians...
Paimon: Oooh, there are so many cute Saurians in Natlan! Paimon's gonna make friends with every single one!
Traveler: Oh? Someone sounds confident...
Paimon: You bet! Paimon's got it all figured out!
Traveler: Oh you do, huh? Come on then, what's the secret to making Saurian friends?
Paimon: It's really simple! First, you've gotta sweet-talk them, show 'em you mean well so they relax their defenses. Then, you gently pat them on the head â€” that makes them feel more comfortable around you.
Paimon: Last but not least: Get 'em some good grub! The way to a Saurian's heart is through the stomach, after all! What do you think? Solid plan, huh?
Traveler: Hmm, why do I get the feeling that...
Paimon: Would not! Paimon can't be won over by some cheap tricks!
Traveler: Huh? Oh, you misunderstand! I meant to say that...
Paimon: Hah! Flattery, really? You think that'll work on Paimon? Think again!
Traveler: But I was being sincere, Paimon!
Paimon: ...Wait, really? Sweet Madame? Oh, heck yes! Paimon could totally go for some of that right now!
Paimon: ...Uhh... What's with that smug look on your face? ...What!? Is Paimon missing something?
Traveler: Ah, how can I prove it you? With some Sweet Madame, perhaps?
Traveler: You're as cute as a baby Saurian!
Traveler: These tactics would also work really well on you?
