# Proof of Guilt


## Talk 1

Paimon: Ah! That toy tanuki just turned into a human!
Paimon: What's going on? Paimon's never seen one of these before!
Sayu: Not a tanuki... I'm a mujina... *snore*...
Sayu: I'm so tired... If I don't get enough sleep... it'll stunt my growth...
Paimon: Um, is this the "professional" you were talking about?
Paimon: Heh... She doesn't look very professional at all.
Yae Miko: Hehe... She is a member of the Shuumatsuban, a genuine, bona-fide ninja.
Paimon: Wow, a ninja! So was that one of those legendary ninja transformation techniques?
Paimon: Anyway, what's the Shuumatsuban?
Yae Miko: It belongs to the Yashiro Commission. A secret unit under Kamisato Ayato.
Yae Miko: Now, Kamisato Ayato and the Yashiro Commission are neutral parties, so I have no right to give orders to the Shuumatsuban.
Yae Miko: However, convincing their most chronically lazy member to help us is well within my abilities.
Sayu: Ah...
Yae Miko: Here's what I need you to do: Go into town and find evidence of the Tenryou Commission's betrayal.
Yae Miko: It would not be appropriate for me to be seen there myself.
Paimon: You make it sound so simple, but...
Traveler: I have no idea what I'm looking for.
Yae Miko: Hmm? Oh, I thought you would have figured it out by now. Alright then, I'll indulge you with a little more information.
Yae Miko: For a complete outsider, probing the inner workings of the Tenryou Commission is nigh on impossible.
Yae Miko: But since the three Commissions work together to serve the Shogun, they have a close relationship. Someone from one of the other Commissions might have an easier job of figuring out what they're up to...
Traveler: The Yashiro Commission!
Yae Miko: Hehe... Now you're following me.
Yae Miko: The Shogun's Army haven't given up on their search for you yet, but with the help of this Shuumatsuban ninja, I'm sure you'll be able to rendezvous with your friends.
Yae Miko: Don't forget we're on a tight schedule here. Be sure to bring back the evidence in good time.
Traveler: What exactly is the evidence?

## Talk 2

Thoma: #{NICKNAME}, what brings you here?
Thoma: Did you meet with the resistance? How's the battle going? Is it safe for me to come out yet?
Paimon: Not just yet... We saw people patrolling on our way here.
Thoma: So it's still not over... I guess you came here because you have something to discuss?
Thoma: I'll get someone to call for Miss Kamisato, bear with me for one second.
Paimon: You inform Ayaka and Thoma of the current situation...
Kamisato Ayaka: I see. You have been through a lot since we last met.
Kamisato Ayaka: I understand, you need evidence of the Tenryou Commission's betrayal. Let me think...
Kamisato Ayaka: Now that you mention it, there is one thing that has always concerned me. The Shogun's Army has been at war with the resistance for a long time now, but not once has the Shogun ever inquired about it.
Kamisato Ayaka: I used to think that she simply didn't care, but looking at it now, perhaps the problem all along has been with the <color=#00E1FFFF>Tenryou Commission's reports</color> to the Shogun.
Paimon: What do you mean?
Kamisato Ayaka: The Tenryou Commission presides over domestic military affairs. If they ever had any intention of concealing information in their reports, we would have no way of knowing.
Kamisato Ayaka: Meanwhile, the Shogun would incorrectly conclude that the Vision Hunt Decree poses no threat, and would stick to her decision. If we had access to their reports, it would confirm everything.
Thoma: But as I recall, the only person authorized to access that kind of official documentation is Kujou Takayuki.
Thoma: It's heavily guarded too. Even with Sayu's help, swiping a document from under their noses is no easy task.
Kamisato Ayaka: If only there was a way we could distract the guards just for long enough.
Kamisato Ayaka: Hmm...
Traveler: A distraction, you say...
Thoma: Yoimiya's fireworks!
Kamisato Ayaka: That's a very Thoma-sounding suggestion...
Kamisato Ayaka: But it's a reasonable one. The Statue of the Omnipresent God is right by the Tenryou Commission. If someone set off fireworks near the statue, they certainly wouldn't ignore it.
Kamisato Ayaka: While they were preoccupied with that, Sayu could infiltrate the Tenryou Commission and take the report, as well as any other evidence she might find...
Thoma: Great! It feels like I'm getting closer and closer to being a free man again.
Thoma: Ah... It feels like it's been an eternity since we last sat down and talked like this.
Traveler: It's not been quite that long...
Thoma: Well, it certainly felt like it to me... I've been looking forward to seeing you again every day since I got here!
Thoma: This teahouse used to be my favorite hiding place, but now... I've honestly lost track of how long it's been since I last set foot outside of here.
Thoma: Oh, man! I want to go to the hot springs so badly!
Paimon: Poor Thoma...
Kamisato Ayaka: Let's focus on the issue at hand. The sooner the Vision Hunt Decree is abolished, the sooner Thoma will be free.
Kamisato Ayaka: This was a reunion of sorts, but there's no time to catch up. We'll celebrate properly when it's all over.
Thoma: Oh, let's play the hot pot game again!
Paimon: You're still thinking about that!?
Kamisato Ayaka: The Tenryou Commission is heavily guarded. Be careful when you get near. Let's meet back here afterwards.
Paimon: #Alright, {NICKNAME}. First, let's go to <color=#00E1FFFF>Hanamizaka</color> to find <color=#00E1FFFF>Yoimiya</color>.
Traveler: We've done this before...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Yoimiya, we need an extra-large firework! The super, duper big kind!
Yoimiya: "Extra-large firework"?
Yoimiya: Hee-hee, you sure came to the right person.
Yoimiya: As it happens, I made this really souped-up one just a couple days ago.
Yoimiya: But it's so powerful that I haven't found anywhere I can test it out yet... may as well give it to you. Let me know how it turns out.
Yoimiya: Don't forget, move well away from it after you light the fuse, and try to avoid burning your clothes. Also, it's best that you cover your ears...
Paimon: Eh, why does Paimon feel so nervous all of a sudden...
Yoimiya: Hahaha, don't worry, it's just a firework, come on. What's the worst that could happen!
Paimon: We'll give it a try... Thanks, Yoimiya.

## Talk 4

Sayu: Hmm... Pretty much how I thought...
Sayu: There are loads and loads of people... If one of them spots me, I'll get caught...
Sayu: We need to get rid of them, or I won't be able to sneak inside...
Traveler: We'll just have to trust Yoimiya.
Sayu: After I get the document, let's meet back at <color=#00E1FFFF>Komore Teahouse</color>, okay?
Sayu: Also, if I do get caught... please come rescue me...
Paimon: Is this really a good idea...?
Paimon: Uh, a—anyway, let's make our way to the <color=#00E1FFFF>statue</color>! Careful does it, watch out for guards and don't get caught!

## Talk 5

Kamisato Ayaka: #Well, {NICKNAME}? How did it go?
Traveler: I'm not sure...
Kamisato Ayaka: Well done. Let's wait for news from Sayu.
Paimon: After some time...
Sayu: *panting*...
Sayu: I know exercise helps you grow, but this was a little too much exercise...
Sayu: I feel so dizzy... Everyone is spinning...
Sayu: No, I can't sleep yet. There was something important I was supposed to do first... Oh, right, yeah. I got it!
Sayu: I didn't know how to find the document you guys were talking about, so I just swiped a whole bunch of stuff that looked suspicious.
Sayu: Here you go... I'm going to sleep now...
Thoma: Milady, what are we looking at?
Kamisato Ayaka: This sealed envelope must be an official report that the Tenryou Commission is preparing to present to the Shogun.
Kamisato Ayaka: In addition, we have... correspondence with the Fatui.
Kamisato Ayaka: It seems that Guuji Yae was right. They have been fomenting unrest behind the scenes.
Kamisato Ayaka: #{NICKNAME}, this should be ample evidence. Please take them to <color=#00E1FFFF>Guuji Yae</color>. I trust she will have a plan for the next step.
Kamisato Ayaka: I will also gather some people to try and root out the rest of the Fatui in Inazuma.
Thoma: Still, mind yourself when you face the Shogun. I still get goosebumps just thinking about her drawing that blade...
Kamisato Ayaka: Again, we'll just have to trust Guuji Yae. She is close to the Shogun, so maybe she will have a way...
Paimon: If Paimon remembers correctly, it should be time for our meeting with Yae Miko soon.
Paimon: Let's pack up our things and get ready to head to the <color=#00E1FFFF>Grand Narukami Shrine</color>.
Traveler: We lit the firework and ran away...
