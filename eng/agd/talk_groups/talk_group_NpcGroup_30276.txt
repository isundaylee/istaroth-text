Traveler: I'd like to learn about "Across the Wilderness."
Vinkel: "Across the Wilderness" is a fun event held by the Adventurers' Guild, aiming to test the adventurers' strength in various aspects!
Vinkel: During the event, the participating adventurers need to find the Wilderness Balloons according to the prompts and venture forward following the distribution of those balloons.
Vinkel: The more Wilderness Balloons one collects within the time limit, the higher the rating and the greater the rewards will be.
