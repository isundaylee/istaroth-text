Traveler: About Arana...
Araja: Arana is also an ancient Aranara, with so many blooms and rainfall captured in memories.
Araja: Because of the overflowing love for Nara and the forest, Arana refuses to be Vasara Tree. Vasara Tree, can't play with Nara.
Araja: Araja heard that, Arana and Narana went traveling together. All the stories and beautiful things on the trip, hopefully, will make up for Arana's loss.
