# Delicious Tuna Sushi

A traditional dish made with one's bare hands. The delicate fat lines the fish slices like hoarfrost falling on a road, and the balance of fat and lean is perfect. The make of this dish is not fancy in the slightest, but has imparted both the profundity of field and sea to the tasting tongue.
