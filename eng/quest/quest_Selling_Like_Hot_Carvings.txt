# Selling Like Hot Carvings

Qasit: Aww... I got the same one again. When will I get the chubby, squishy one...
Qasit: I guess I'll just have to save up my allowance and get them all.
Alia: Huh...? I thought you came here every day! Have you still not collected them all yet?
Alia: You should've gotten them as a set. That way, you get seven different designs at once.
Qasit: But then there's no surprise...
Alia: Surprises are boring! I want to have every design there is! That's what you do when you really love something.
Alia: I've finally saved up enough to buy the set today.
Mamdouh: I'm very sorry, but the one Qasit bought was our very last carving. We're out of stock today.
Mamdouh: But, we're working on expanding our team, so please check back tomorrow!
Alia: Fine, I'll come back tomorrow. Hmph, just so you know, Aranara carvings are more than just "stock"!
Qasit: Yeah!
Mamdouh: Alright, alright, I'm sorry...
Fayez: Sorry buddy, our Aranara carvings have sold out for today.
Ruhi: Sold out? Oh no... I was gonna buy one for my cousin who's visiting tomorrow.
Fayez: Hey, how about this? You live near Razi's house, right? We'll deliver the new carvings to you first thing tomorrow.
Ruhi: Wow, thanks, Mr. Fayez! Don't forget, okay!
Fayez: I promise. Acara Crafts would never let down a child!
Fayez: Ah, more customers. Sorry, our Aranara carvings have...
Fayez: Oh hey, it's you guys. Thank you so much for your help. We've been planning on visiting you to express our gratitude, but as you can see... our store's been really busy.
Fayez: If it weren't for you, the store's anniversary might have been a different story.
Traveler: Looks like your business is doing very well.
Traveler: Looks like the Aranara are really popular.
Fayez: It's all thanks to Razi. He has so much creativity at such a young age.
Fayez: Oh, and we would like you to have the Prototype Aranara as a small token of appreciation.
Collei: Woah, wait... This looks kinda...
Traveler: Mind-blowing.
Collei: Right, mind-blowing. It has a very... mysterious feel.
Paimon: Umm... We appreciate your thought, but please give us some time to decide if we wanna keep it.
Black Screen Text: Now that the toymakers' problems are resolved, let's visit Tanger and Razi!

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Razi: The Aranara father owned up to his mistake and was forgiven by his Aranara son...
Razi: Hmm... I think everyone will like how the story goes, but the reason the father owned up to his mistake was too simple.
Tanger: Perhaps we could make them go through some kind of hardship together. I'm sure they'll become more understanding of each other that way. The Aranara father will feel guilty after seeing his son work hard.
Razi: Hmm, when the Aranara father starts feeling guilty, should he speak more slowly, or more quickly?
Tanger: That depends on the Aranara son. It would be interesting to hear them speak at different paces.
Paimon: Hey, Tanger and Razi, whatcha up to?
Razi: Dad and I are just discussing our latest story. I'll be the one telling the story this time.
Razi: But I'm a little nervous about telling a story in front of so many people. That's why I'm asking Dad for advice.
Paimon: Ooh! Sumeru's gonna have a new young storyteller.
Tanger: If it weren't for you, Razi would surely have left me for good.
Paimon: Paimon's so glad everything worked out!
Paimon: But... there's still something that doesn't quite add up!
Collei: Oh? What is it? Do you need help investigating something?
Paimon: Why would a Mondstadter leave a note in a tree hollow deep in the Avidya Forest?
Collei: Iâ€”I thought we moved on from this topic! Um... it was just a coincidence!
Collei: A lot of people write down their secrets and hide them in tree hollows! It's not a big deal at all...
Traveler: Collei looks kinda flustered all of a sudden.
Collei: Ugh... Uhhh... Okay...
Collei: I have my secrets and troubles too. And... I tell them to tree hollows.
Collei: But seeing Razi and Tanger has given me an idea:
Collei: #{NICKNAME}, could you be my tree hollow?
Traveler: It'd be my pleasure.
Traveler: Sure.
Traveler: Is it really that common?

### Additional Talk 2

Razi: The Aranara father owned up to his mistake and was forgiven by his Aranara son...
Razi: Hmm... I think everyone will like how the story goes, but the conflict was resolved a little too quickly.
Tanger: Perhaps we could let them go through some kind of hardship together. I'm sure they'll become more understanding of each other. We can make the Aranara father feel remorseful after seeing his son's efforts.
Razi: When the Aranara father starts feeling remorseful, should he speak more slowly, or quickly?
Tanger: That depends on the Aranara son. It would be interesting to hear them speak at different paces.
Paimon: Hey, Tanger and Razi, what's up!
Razi: Dad and I are just discussing our latest story. I'll be the one telling the story this time.
Razi: But I'm a little nervous about telling a story in front of so many people. That's why I'm asking Dad for advice.
Paimon: Ooh! Sumeru's gonna have a new young storyteller.
Tanger: If it weren't for you, Razi would surely have left me for good.

Collei: I-I thought we moved on from this topic! Um... it was just a coincidence!
Collei: A lot of people write down their secrets and hide them in tree hollows! It's not a big deal at all...
Traveler: Collei looks kinda flustered all of a sudden.
Collei: Ugh... Uhhh... Okay...
Collei: I might have an idea about who that Mondstadter is.
Collei: I'll tell you more about it when we get the chance.
Traveler: Sure thing.
Traveler: I look forward to that day.
Traveler: Is it really that common?
