Bulletin Board: "When I first heard that someone wanted to rent Ms. Hina's advertising board, I refused. But the offer was very generous, so I thought I'd at least pay a visit to the site first."
Bulletin Board: "The moment I arrived at the venue, I was deeply touched. Even with such a tight budget and a miserable venue..."
Bulletin Board: "...the organizers still managed to reserve enough budget for Ms. Hina. Surely, this is true love? I signed the rental contract immediately."
