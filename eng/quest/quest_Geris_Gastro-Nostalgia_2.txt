# Geri's Gastro-Nostalgia


## Talk 1

Traveler: About Tea Break Pancakes...
Geri: Ah yes, that would be my commission. Have you already prepared two Tea Break Pancakes?
Traveler: Yep, here they are.
Traveler: Not yet.
Geri: Please remember to bring them to me as soon as they're ready. It's been quite some time since I've had Tea Break Pancakes...

## Talk 2

Geri: These Tea Break Pancakes smell amazing! This is going to be a real treat.
Geri: Oh right, I'll need some more Almond Tofu to compare the tastes.
Geri: Oh! I almost forgot... These are for you, thanks for your help.
