# Fate's Chosen Lupical


## Talk 1

Razor: Looks like this. Can use to stop bleeding.

## Talk 2

Razor: Who's there?
Paimon: Chill out Razor, it's only us.
Razor: You... are also knight?
Paimon: ...So you don't know each other after all?
Traveler: "The red one, burny girl..."
Razor: No. This girl also red, but not so burny like other girl.
Amber: This is starting to make sense. Is this the wolf boy you were talking about?
Paimon: Correct! His name is Razor.
Razor: Help me out.
Amber: With what?
Razor: No time. I sent Lupical away. People coming, bad people.
Paimon: Those guys from earlier?
Amber: I understand. But first, I have a few questions—
Razor: *sniff* I smell blood. Quick.
Amber: Blood? I hope the wolves didn't attack those idiots...
Traveler: That wasn't Amber?

## Talk 3

Amber: Blood droplets!
Razor: Not human blood, wolf blood. Lupical blood...
Paimon: Loopy what now? Are you gonna tell us what it means yet?
Razor: Lupical is family fate gave me. When wolf accepts human as its own. Or human accepts wolf. That is Lupical.
Paimon: Sounds like gibberish to me.
Amber: That's strange, where does the word come from? Surely it wasn't made up by the wolves?
Razor: It's just the name he gave.
Amber: ...Who's "he"?
Razor: Guardian of this land.
Paimon: Wouldn't that be Barbatos though? He is the ruler of Mondstadt.
Razor: Enough. Another clue. Follow me.
Amber: Hey, wait! This is your chance to prove your innocence!
Paimon: He's already gone!

## Talk 4

Razor: This is him. We find his blood. Bad men did this.
Paimon: How terrible...
Amber: I do agree that it's awful. But that doesn't change the fact that—
Razor: We didn't attack village! Not us!
Razor: A black wolf and his pack, not from here. They try to take over land. They broke the code.
Paimon: <color=#00E1FFFF>Whose code?</color>
Razor: Guardian of this land.
Amber: That's now the second time you've brought that up. Tell us who that is.
Razor: I take Lupical further in. Follow me, maybe you see.

## Talk 5

Paimon: Where are we?
Razor: #{NICKNAME}, help me. Collect these.
Paimon: Aren't those wolfhook seeds?
Razor: Crush them. Put on wound. Bleeding stop.
Amber: It's true. Wolfhook seeds have a liquid coating that not only functions as a mild painkiller, but also has a hemostatic effect...
Amber: ...I read that in a book.
Paimon: Why?
Amber: ...I have no idea.
Razor: Hooks help seeds move. Liquid stops pain and bleeding.
Razor: Animal doesn't feel hooks, they take seeds far away.
Razor: ...Purple teacher told me so.
Razor: I stay here, take care of this one. I answer red girl's questions.
Amber: Right. And if that lot does come back, I doubt they will try their luck against a member of the Knights of Favonius.
Amber: #Your wolf friend is not clear of my suspicion just yet. But {NICKNAME}, we'll still need to fetch those seeds.

## Talk 6

Amber: Traveler, go and find some Wolfhooks. I need to talk with Razor.

## Talk 7

Paimon: We're back! Have we got enough?
Razor: Yes. Enough.
Amber: Razor was just telling me about the wolven code of conduct. Mind-blowing stuff.
Razor: Thank you.
Hopkins the Marvelous: We've looked everywhere and haven't seen any other wolves.
Jotun: Yep, that's wolves for you. The one we managed to capture must have been sick or something.
Hopkins the Marvelous: Wh—What are you doing here?
Razor: Revenge.
Jotun: It's him! The one who was raised by wolves!
Hopkins the Marvelous: Huh!?
Hopkins the Marvelous: So, it was you. I should have known, wolves aren't smart enough to be behind this.
Hopkins the Marvelous: I can't believe you would help wolves plot against humans!
Hopkins the Marvelous: They throw you some scraps and you treat them like kin? Have you forgotten what you are?
Amber: Enough!
Paimon: Yeah! You can't talk about Razor like that!
Jotun: The Knights of Favonius are gonna let this guy off!?
Razor: We. Did. Not. Raid. Village.

## Talk 8

Amber: Traveler, go and find some Wolfhooks. I need to talk with Razor.

## Talk 9

Razor: Looks like this. Can use to stop bleeding.

## Talk 10

Razor: Please. Calm down.
Boreas: Hmph...
Boreas: It's just like he said. An outside wolf pack coming in and breaking the rules. They will reap what they have sown.
Boreas: But Razor — you must not get involved. This is for the wolves to settle between themselves.
Boreas: You fight not with claws, but with the sword. You strike not with teeth, but with lightning...
Boreas: You are human, Razor.
Razor: I am not like them! I don't belong.
Boreas: You are no wolf. This is a matter for the wolves, and the wolves alone.
Boreas: And you, you are Razor's Lupical amongst humans. Your nobility stands out against others of your kind.
Boreas: If you ever wish, you may train with me.
Boreas: I have nothing further to say. May we meet again, Razor, and company...
Amber: Hey... Razor, what's that look for? Why don't you come to the city for a few days?
Paimon: Yeah! You have a friend in Mondstadt anyway right?
Paimon: Y'know... that red, burny friend of yours?
Amber: You're not safe in the wild anymore. But I know that you don't want to hurt them.
Razor: I'm fine. Don't worry. But I'm not city human...
Razor: But also not wolf...
Traveler: Razor...
Razor: #Thank you. {NICKNAME}, Paimon and... other red girl.
Amber: Hey!? We've been with you all this time, and you still don't even know my name!?
Razor: Goodbye.
Traveler: Cheer up...
