# A Visitor From Westward Realms: The Flavor of Freedom


## Talk 1

Paimon: Why, hello there! Are you talking about stuff to eat?
Traveler: Hello, Sara, Nazafarin.
Sara: Ah, we meet again, you two. Indeed, one might say that our conversation did concern food, but... *sigh*
Paimon: What happened? Don't worry, you can tell us. Maybe we can even help!
Paimon: #If it's about food, we'll definitely help! Isn't that right, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: Will work for good food!
Nazafarin: Ah, by Lesser Lord Kusanali, the two of you are as warm-hearted as ever!
Nazafarin: So this is the issue. After you rescued me previously, I returned to Sumeru and wrote a report about the condiment market in Liyue.
Nazafarin: Unexpectedly, I was approached by Lord Sangemah Bay, who expressed interest in purchasing the condiments that were the results of my research.
Nazafarin: This most charitable merchant even offered to support any further research on my part! Ah, such good fortune! I signed right away, if you must know...
Nazafarin: I then sent my dear friend Parvaneh a letter regarding this, and she gave me her full support.
Paimon: So you're here in Mondstadt to start research into condiments?
Nazafarin: That is precisely right, my good Paimon. In truth, I should've already begun this research, but...
Sara: Nazafarin wants to work with us by adding her secret condiments to our dishes and letting our customers try them.
Sara: However, we have restaurant standards that we must maintain, lest we face complaints from long-time customers, so we can't take her up on that offer.
Sara: *sigh* We've actually been having this chat for a while now, but we haven't been able to come up with any better ideas.
Sara: I've been thinking that perhaps we could ask Jean to help. I'm sure she could find the best solution to this problem!
Paimon: Seriously!? Jean's super busy all the time, you know! So, uh, could we not make her come down just for this? We'll help out!
Nazafarin: Aha, you see, what did I say? The two of you are Nazafarin's saviors, as always!
Nazafarin: Right, then, there's no time to lose. Please, take this pot with you.
Nazafarin: We shall do it as we did previously. We will make the condiments, add them to dishes, and invite your friends to try them!
Paimon: Hehe. That's right, we'll do it just like before. Paimon volunteers to be the first taste-tester, by the way!
Traveler: Eh, we'll do this for Paimon, I guess.
Traveler: Hello there. And you are...
Nazafarin: Ah, by Lesser Lord Kusanali! Do you not recognize me anymore?
Nazafarin: Perhaps my presence is too weak, like a speck of dust that might be blown away by a gust at any time...
Nazafarin: But I, for my part, remember your great deed in helping me develop seasonings and inviting all and sundry to try them!

## Talk 2

Nazafarin: Ah, Lesser Lord Kusanali be praised! My thanks to you two, many thanks indeed!
Traveler: Could you remind me how to use this pot again?
Nazafarin: Right, yes, of course. A great hero such as yourself is rather busy, after all, perhaps too busy to remember such things. I did not consider that.
Nazafarin: It's actually quite simple. You simply need to add the correct seasonings at the right time.
Nazafarin: I'm sure you'll work it out once you try it.
Traveler: See you.
Nazafarin: See you. Once again, you have Nazafarin's utmost thanks! May this go smoothly for you.
