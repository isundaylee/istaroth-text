Arlecchino: You intend to take a rest? I concur. You do look quite tired.
Arlecchino: Self-knowledge is a good trait to have. Better to walk at a slower pace if it means you will travel further in the end.
Arlecchino: I brought some coffee candies. Here, take one.

## Talk 1

Arlecchino: The enemies we face are of a lowly breed. Deal with them however you see fit.
Arlecchino: But do not get complacent. You should expect to fend for yourself, as I am not in the habit of coming to other people's rescue.
Arlecchino: If you do encounter a foe for whom you are no match, simply make yourself scarce, and I shall deal with it in due course.

## Talk 2

Arlecchino: Before I go on a long journey, I tend to leave the children of the House of the Hearth with some homework to complete in my absence.
Arlecchino: Many of them, however, simply play to their hearts' content for most of the time I am gone, then rush to get their homework done in the final few days before my return.
Arlecchino: They believe I am none the wiser, but I have simply elected not to expose their chicanery. After all, to complete one's work in a short timeframe is a skill in its own right.
