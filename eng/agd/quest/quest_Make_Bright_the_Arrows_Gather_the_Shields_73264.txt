# Make Bright the Arrows, Gather the Shields...


## Talk 1

Paimon: Babel really cares for Jeht...

## Talk 2

Paimon: The location Babel marked... This should be the place! Let's go and find out if Jeht is here!

## Talk 3

Fatui Skirmisher No. 2: Password? Wait... We're under attack!

## Talk 4

Investigate (Scattered Matchsticks): (An opened matchbox with the Fatui's Delusion logo printed on it. Used matchsticks are scattered around it, not yet buried by the sands.)
Investigate (Scattered Matchsticks): (One cannot help but wonder why the Fatui Skirmishers would use this method to start a fire when they could simply drive elements.)

## Talk 5

Investigate (Empty Wooden Box): (An empty wooden box, which has not been buried by the sands yet. Obviously, it was just recently abandoned, and the owner should not have gone far.)

## Talk 6

Paimon: Whoa... The sandstorm is almost blinding Paimon! Huh? Is there someone in the sandstorm?

## Talk 7

Investigate (Paimon): Hmm... There's another document mentioned here. Why don't we search that one, too?

## Talk 8

Paimon: Whoa... The sandstorm is almost blinding Paimon! Huh? Is there someone in the sandstorm?

## Talk 9

Investigate (Paimon): That's how it is... They're taking Jeht to the canyon!

## Talk 10

Paimon: Let's keep going! There should be more of them ahead!

## Talk 11

Investigate (Paimon): Hmm... There's another document mentioned here. Why don't we search that one, too?

## Talk 12

Investigate (Paimon): There's nothing about Jeht... Let's keep looking and see if there're any other files at the camp.

## Talk 13

Investigate (Paimon): That's how it is... They're taking Jeht to the canyon!

## Talk 14

Paimon: Hmm... It seems that someone in the tribe is working with the Fatui, that's why Jeht... Ugh! Who could it be?
Traveler: Maybe it's the same person who framed Jeht for her rebellion...
Paimon: Then we'd better find Jeht first and fast. She's still in great danger, and now, the Tanit tribe is no longer a safe place either.
Paimon: Let's hurry!
Traveler: We must find Jeht first and fast.
Paimon: You're right. After all, she's still in great danger. We must find her soon and figure out what's going on!

## Talk 15

Babel: You're back. Is there any news about Jeht?
Traveler: I need a bit more time.
Babel: Of course... Please, make sure you find her.
Traveler: About Jeht...
Babel: I still cannot fathom why she'd cooperate with those dangerous northerners... Maybe it's those northerners who kidnapped her.
Babel: In any case, she would need to either confess to the Tanit or publicly prove her innocence. It's the tribe's rules, and there's nothing I can do about it.
Traveler: About the Fatui...
Babel: As I said before, the Tanit used to have established a trade relationship with them. But soon after, these northerners started planting spies and training moles among us...
Babel: Only by then did I realize that the people who sent them to the desert are probably not well-intentioned...
Babel: Hence, we expelled those northerners from tribal territory, and only allowed them to settle on the outskirts of the desert.
Babel: Who knew they harbored such... lofty ambitions, and still tried to infiltrate our tribe regardless. Perhaps they heard about the Eternal Oasis...
Traveler: Bye.
Babel: May quicksand and poisonous winds stay away from you, esteemed Master of the Jinni!

## Talk 16

Investigate (Large Military Boots): (Apparently, these are military assets belonging to the Fatui Skirmishers. It is unclear how they ended up here. They're already filled with sand...)
Investigate (Large Military Boots): (Wearing these now must be extra tormenting...)

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Babel: Greetings, esteemed Master of the Jinni. Have you got any news?
Traveler: We're still looking for Jeht.
Babel: That's good... I hope you find her soon. I'm also very... very concerned about her.
Babel: Ugh... You have no idea how much I want to question those northerners in person, but if I rushed it, it would definitely alarm them, which would be even more detrimental to Jeht's safety.
Babel: Therefore, esteemed Master of the Jinni, on tribe's future rests on your shoulders.
Traveler: She's been kidnapped by the Fatui.
Babel: Is that so... In other words, she didn't betray the tribe? No... We still can't rule that possibility out...
Babel: I see... Can you confirm her location? I will send people to rescue her immediately.
Traveler: I... I don't know.
Babel: ...
Babel: In this case, even if we sent out a rescue team, it would only alert those northerners... It isn't to her advantage.
Babel: Although making such a decision makes my heart ache much, I refuse to startle our enemy. I will continue to wait for your words.
