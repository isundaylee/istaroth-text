Traveler: Thoma's message:
Bulletin Board (Thoma's Message): "Hey, bro! Haven't seen you since the Irodori Festival. I hope you're doing well. I didn't know you were gonna be hosting a huge festival â€” you sure kept that quiet! Nice work!"
Bulletin Board (Thoma's Message): "If you ever wanna host another festival in the future, feel free to come and discuss it with me first. If you need a venue or furnishings or anything else, I'll see what I can do. Everything's negotiable!"
Bulletin Board (Thoma's Message): "By the way, I know you like beetle fighting, and I remembered that I had a couple of King Onikabuto at home. I left them on the wooden box over there. Enjoy!"
