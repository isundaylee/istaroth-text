Mikhail: Hey, you heard what the Liyue merchants have been saying? It's true — their archon's really gone and died. They did a whole funeral and everything!
Mikhail: If you think about it, that's a good thing for the Fatui. This is likely to cause major upheaval in Liyue...
Mikhail: If we can take advantage of the power vacuum during the ensuing chaos...
Lyudmila: But we'll just have to wait and see whether this is ultimately good or bad news.
Lyudmila: It may cause difficulties for us. Economically, for instance — Liyue is the biggest trading hub in Teyvat after all...
Mikhail: What's the worst that could happen? You're worrying over nothing. Snezhnaya's economy is rock-solid, so we won't be affected.
