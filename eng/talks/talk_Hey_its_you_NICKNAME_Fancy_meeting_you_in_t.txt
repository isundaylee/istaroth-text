Amber: #Hey, it's you, {NICKNAME}! Fancy meeting you in the Whispering Woods again. What are the odds?
Amber: It's been a while, hasn't it? What've you been busy with lately?
Traveler: Taking photos to keep a record of the places we've been.
Traveler: Taking photos to commemorate my legendary career with.
Amber: Haha, that makes sense! This place is so beautiful and serene, it really does make for good photos.
Amber: This is my favorite patrol segment when I'm out on scouting missions.
Amber: This was where we met for the first time, too. I even mistook you for some kind of suspicious character back then, too! Ah, I'm getting embarrassed just thinking about it...
Amber: After all, it was thanks to your help that we averted the crisis with Dvalin, and restored peace to Mondstadt.
Amber: #But your {M#sister}{F#brother}... I put up so many missing posters, but it seems like it wasn't of any help...
Traveler: It's fine, Amber.
Traveler: You did all you could.
Amber: Thanks. But still, please feel free to tell me if there's anything I can help you with.
Amber: Amber, Outrider of the Knights of Favonius, Mondstadt's Gliding Champion, and your friend â€” at your service!
Traveler: In that case, step into the frame, please!
Amber: But I don't see your Kamera. Are you sure you've got it on you?
