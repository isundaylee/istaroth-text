Sucrose: I once read a story about a wonderful paradise. Later on in life, it was also books that got me interested in studying alchemy.
Sucrose: It's funny, but even now, that storybook about paradise and my alchemy textbooks are right next to each other on the bookshelf next to my bed...
Sucrose: One day, I hope to break down the barriers between those books by using bio-alchemy to create that paradise for real.
