## Talk 2

"Guhua Notes": "...Practicing the Light Piercer technique. Destroyed all the dummies by mistake... No money or resources... I've got an idea. I'll tie straws together to make my own..."
"Guhua Notes": "Gathering straw."
"Guhua Notes": "Tying straw. Exhausting."
"Guhua Notes": "...Practicing the Light Piercer technique. Destroyed all the dummies by mistake... I might as well train with the sword first."
Traveler: Continue reading.
"Guhua Notes": "...Bored. As I sat before the courtyard, I felt slightly hungry... I pondered on what I saw the other day, and I suddenly felt enlightened. If I use the sword... (indiscernible) I'll call it Rain Cutter. I'll try it another day."
"Guhua Notes": "...I accidentally fell while practicing Rain Cutter. Luckily, it's nothing serious... I thought of an idea. Why not dig a deep pond below the piles? Not only will it prevent injuries from falls, but I can raise fish for food..."
"Guhua Notes": "...I went to a fisherman and bought dozens of fish... I tried cooking them. Their deliciousness was unrivaled..."
"Guhua Notes": (The next ten or so pages are dedicated to detailed records of cooking methods for fish, and some are even paired with illustrations.)
"Guhua Notes": "...Accidentally fell while practicing Rain Cutter."
"Guhua Notes": "...Success."
Traveler: Continue reading.
"Guhua Notes": "...The spear and sword must be wielded with the same mastery as... (Indiscernible. There is a comment from the 3rd Master beside it: second nature.) ... And that, is the truth... Yet there is none... How shall it be granted? How shall it be revealed?"
"Guhua Notes": "...Renovate the library. Design... within, and..."
"Guhua Notes": "...Look with the <color=#00E1FFFF>eyes</color>, and combine <color=#00E1FFFF>scrolls of knowledge from all places</color> with <color=#00E1FFFF>chambers of all corners</color>, then..."
"Guhua Notes": (The next few pages are smudged and unintelligible. There is a comment from the 3rd Master at the side: This advises future generations to read extensively.)
Traveler: Continue reading.
"Guhua Notes": "...Recovered from injury. The little Bai kid visited with mutton and fish. Plump, delicious, and without any pungent smells. I asked for the recipe... Passed down the Life Ender technique... Recorded here."
"Guhua Notes": (The following pages contain detailed records of various methods of cooking mutton.)
Traveler: I've had enough. It's such a mess...
Traveler: I've had enough. The training process isn't recorded at all...
Traveler: I've had enough of this nonsense...

## Talk 3

"Guhua Notes": "...Practicing the Light Piercer technique. Destroyed all the dummies by mistake... No money or resources... I've got an idea. I'll tie straws together to make my own..."
Traveler: (I'm a little concerned about something I just read...)

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Wen the Fourth: Sigh... To think that after a thousand years of heritage, the Guhua Clan's head doorkeeper must cheat others to survive... What shall we do, what can be done...
Huang the Third: Ugh... Alright, come on now. Am I not sparing my junior from starving to death while guarding our gates...?
Huang the Third: #And don't look at me like that. You're always depressed... But you were pleased to see {NICKNAME}'s performance just now, weren't you?
Wen the Fourth: That fool from before? They get to take a look around for making you some rice with bacon? And I would be pleased about that? I would slap you to death if I were a few years younger...
Huang the Third: Heh! Your technique was inferior to mine just a few years ago!
Huang the Third: ...Anyway, listen... Only a few of us geezers are left. What do you plan to do after we stop testing those who may be destined to join us? Take those books with us to our graves?
Wen the Fourth: ...
Huang the Third: Hah... Just forget it. What's the point of saying such depressing things?
Huang the Third: Oh, why don't you try the food those kids made me? Hehe! I think it's better than Wanmin Restaurant's fare! Here, take a bite! Just a bite!
