Traveler: Wait. Fish don't count as meat?
Jabari: ...Well, that's an unexpected reply!
Jabari: Does fish count as meat? Hmm. I suppose each person might have a different answer in mind...
Jabari: But that's not the problem here. I'm just wondering what I should have for dinner.
Jabari: Speaking of which, are you hungry? Would you like to have a little something?
Jabari: I don't mean to brag, but I do make some excellent food. Drop by if you've got the time and try some!
