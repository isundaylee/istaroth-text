# Her Secret


## Talk 1

Paimon: Are you sure this is the right place? It feels like we keep heading deeper into the middle of nowhere...
Paimon: #Hey, doesn't that tree look like the one she described in the directive, Traveler?
Paimon: It looks like there's a way in over there... Let's take a look!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Kokomi!
Paimon: So this is where you ran off to! We were gonna meet up and get things ready for the Victory Feast today, what happened?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Oh... It's you...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I—I apologize... I'm not feeling my usual self today.
Paimon: *gasp* You got sick? We'll go find a doctor right away!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: No no, it's nothing like that... It's just, my energy is completely spent.
Paimon: Y—You run on energy? *gasp* You mean... you're like a Ruin Guard!?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: No, it's just a figure of speech. *sigh* I'm ashamed to admit it, but I can't always be the infinitely capable person I present myself as.
Traveler: Everyone was asking so much of you yesterday...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Oh... you noticed? I guess I haven't quite mastered the ability to hide how I'm feeling. I'll keep working at it...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: To be honest, I'm not really cut out to be a leader. At first, my dream was to read up on military strategy and perhaps become an adviser.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Constantly communicating with people, trying to retain their morale, having to read between the lines, making sure everyone gets the recognition they deserve... It's such hard work.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: You're somehow supposed to make people feel wonderful just from being in your presence, while also commanding their respect... It doesn't come naturally to me. Truth be told, it's something I never wanted for myself.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: But because of my bloodline, I was always going to end up being the Divine Priestess sooner or later. Like it or not, it's just the way it is.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: So whenever I feel overwhelmed, I come here to just lose myself in a book and relax for a while...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Don't worry, it doesn't affect my work. I handed over preparations for the Victory Feast to someone else.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I have to make a speech tonight, and I mustn't give the troops any reason to suspect that something could be wrong. This peace was hard-won, and I want them to feel at ease.
Paimon: Is there anything we can do to help?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I should be feeling energized again soon if I hold off on work for a little longer. *sigh* If only there were some way I could listen to a good read on military strategy, I'm sure that'd speed up the process...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I was reading a book last time I was here, but I only got about halfway through. Where did I put it...
Paimon: We'll find it for you!
Paimon: And then we'll read it out to you — to help you recover!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: You'd do that for me? Thank you.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hehe... I'm really lucky you came back to Watatsumi Island.
Traveler: I could sense things were getting to you.

## Talk 3

Paimon: #Hey, look, Traveler. Could this be the book she wanted?
Paimon: "Swordfish captain came back today. Energy +4..."
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ah, that's... that's just, um...
Traveler: We saw nothing.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Give. It. Here.
Paimon: Eh-heh, guess that was the wrong one... Let's keep looking.
Traveler: (And if we did, it was all Paimon's fault.)

## Talk 4

Paimon: Whoa... Look at all these petitions.
Paimon: So does Kokomi make time to deal with these even when she's resting?
Paimon: "Sangonomiya Events Cash Flow Statement," "Consolidated Annual Report on Fishing Production," "Watatsumi Island Monthly Maintenance Expenses Breakdown"...
Paimon: This is a lot of work for one person. And it's on top of all the directives she has to write and the people she has to meet day-to-day. It's no wonder she gets burnt out from time to time.
Paimon: Let's track down that book and help her feel like herself again!

## Talk 5

Sangonomiya Kokomi: Ahh... I don't even want to move right now.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: It'd be so nice if all my work could just do itself without me having to lift a finger...

## Talk 6

Sangonomiya Kokomi: ...You saw it, didn't you?

## Talk 7

Sangonomiya Kokomi: I'm actually pretty social when I have the energy.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Still, talking to people I don't know is really draining...

## Talk 8

Shibata: Are you looking for Her Excellency?
Shibata: I'm afraid she isn't here at the moment. I don't know where she's gone.
Paimon: So strange... Guess we should just call it a rain check then?
Shibata: Not necessarily. If I recall correctly, Her Excellency has made special provisions for just such a scenario in her General Operational Directives.
Shibata: Let me see... Ah yes, No. 98. * "Should a visitor from afar come to see me, and should my whereabouts be unknown, direct them to proceed southward until they arrive at a tree with purple foliage."*
Shibata: The footnote stipulates that this only applies when Her Excellency has made no communication regarding her whereabouts before disappearing, and even then only when the visitor in question is of VIP status.
Shibata: As far as I'm concerned, you two tick all of the boxes. I keep this directive on me at all times — I'm sure this is the right course of action.
Paimon: Kokomi really does think of everything! Alright, let's find the place she wrote about and have a look.

## Talk 9

Paimon: #It's gotta be this one, right, Traveler?
Paimon: Look, there's even a bookmark. None of the other books have one, so she must have finished reading those already.
Paimon: Whew, it's pretty dense. Paimon doesn't understand a thing...
Paimon: Well, let's take it over and read it to her!

## Talk 10

Paimon: Kokomi, is this the book you wanted?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hmm, I'm not sure, actually... Could you read a bit out loud?
Traveler: "Act to the plan, and plan to the situation"...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: *yawns* Yes, that's the one! Thank you.
Paimon: Kokomi? Kokomi...
Paimon: #Oh no, she's fallen asleep. What're we gonna do, Traveler?
Paimon: Tonight's the Victory Feast! Not to mention that the peace talks are just around the corner. She's got so much to do...
Traveler: Let's let her rest a while.
Paimon: You sure that's a good idea?
Paimon: Hmm, she does look pretty exhausted. Guess there's still some time to go, too. Alright, let's keep her company while she rests.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Avoid disaster... Protect peace at all costs...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The war's over... Things are slowly getting better...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Did you see...?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Uhhhh... Huh? What time is it? Did I fall asleep?
Paimon: Yup, you've been out for ages! It's nearly time for the feast!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: I can't believe it got so late!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: *sigh* I haven't slept that peacefully in so long. That's gotta be three whole energy points right there. Should be enough to see me through the peace talks.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: #Thank you, Traveler. Well, we better get ourselves over there, it's nearly time to light the bonfire.
Paimon: Woohoo, Kokomi's back to full energy! Good to have you back!
Traveler: Let's wake her up.
Paimon: We probably should, after all, she did say she wanted to wrap everything up before the feast kicks off!
Paimon: Kokomi, wakey-wakey!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Hmmmm...? Was I asleep? ...What time is it?
Paimon: Time to get going! It's nearly time for the feast!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Really? It's that time already? Ughhhh... I still don't feel like I'm fully recharged.
Traveler: I'll buy you a new book on military strategy.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Really? Yes! I want the latest volume of the Teyvat Art of War!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: The Yae Publishing House published it last month, but I haven't had the chance to get my hands on it... No backing out now, okay?
Paimon: Huh, that really perked her up.
Paimon: Alright, let's get to the feast!
Traveler: "Attack where the enemy is weak, emerge where the enemy is blind"...
