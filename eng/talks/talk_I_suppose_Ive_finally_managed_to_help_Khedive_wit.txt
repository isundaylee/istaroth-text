# Talk Dialog

Hosseini: I suppose I've finally managed to help Khedive with this dark mud problem of his...
Traveler: Hey there.
Hosseini: #...Ah, Traveler, hello! How is your day going?
Hosseini: Now that I think about it, you truly have been a big help to me a great many times.
Hosseini: The business with the Energy Amplifier, our observations of that special Ruin Grader on Tsurumi Island, and now again here at The Chasm.
Hosseini: Each time, it was always some kind of emergency or highly complicated matter, which was then resolved wonderfully by your presence.
Hosseini: Honestly, I wonder if it's your luck that's good, or if it is my good fortune bumping into you so often...
Traveler: So, how are those memoirs going?
Hosseini: Heh, I mean, I was just saying it ... I still have a long way to go before my achievements are anything worth writing a memoir about.
Hosseini: What's more, there are still many research topics left for me to tackle... and the more I tackle, the more I'll be able to write in my memoirs.
Hosseini: A such, I'm of the view that the later you write your memoirs, the better.
Traveler: So, about Khedive...
Hosseini: Do you mean to ask why I accepted his commission to help him out here at The Chasm?
Hosseini: Do you know of the Purbiruni? Khedive is from that school of researchers.
Hosseini: When I was at the Akademiya, I received quite a lot of help from that school, and so you can consider this a returning of that favor.
Hosseini: I mean, it's just normal to have such relationships, right? And in any case, no one school of researchers can solve all problems by themselves. That's why there's a need for collaboration!
Hosseini: It is how we bond as researchers.
Traveler: Well, all the best, then. See you!
Hosseini: All the best to you too!
Hosseini: Well, I'm hoping that things will turn out for the best, at least...
