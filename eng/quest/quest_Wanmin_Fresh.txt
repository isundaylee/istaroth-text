## Talk 1

Traveler: I have other things to do.
Chef Mao: Sure. I'll find someone else to help...

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'll deliver it right now.
Chef Mao: Thanks a lot, you're a big help.
Chef Mao: Make sure you keep a good grip on this Jewelry Soup, and be careful while you're delivering it. <color=#00E1FFFF>Make sure not to knock it over, and make sure you don't glide</color>, or it'll all spill out.
Chef Mao: Oh yes â€” and <color=#00E1FFFF>don't touch anything weird</color>, or the flavors will get all mixed up...
Chef Mao: Now, hurry and deliver that Jewelry Soup. It won't be any good once it gets cold.

## Talk 3

Tacit Tingfang: Not here yet... So slow.

## Talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Chef Mao: Yes, that's correct. A while ago, a customer named Tingfang ordered a bowl of Jewelry Soup from me. He paid in advance, saying that he wanted it delivered to the Dunyu Ruins.
Chef Mao: I still need to man the restaurant, so I don't have time to make the delivery. It would be great if you're willing to go in my place.
