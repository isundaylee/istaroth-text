Kamran: Oh, you're that Forest Watcher's friend? My apologies.
Kamran: Eleazar is a very troublesome disease in Sumeru. It makes scale-like objects grow on the patient's body.

Traveler: I'm a friend of Tighnari's.
Kamran: Oh, you're that Forest Watcher's friend, are you? My apologies.
Kamran: I'm referring to a Trainee Forest Ranger who's been stationed with us.
Kamran: She was here as part of her recuperation process from the first, so I reckon that she'll be leaving now that she's recovered.
Kamran: Now, she has said that she wouldn't mind staying on as a Forest Ranger, but you know — people change their minds all the time.
Kamran: You can't even trust what the sages say nowadays, so I'm not sure how hopeful I should be about anyone or anything else, you know?
