Traveler: Do you have recommendations?
Louis: Ah, you've come to the right man, friend. We make the best fish and chips in the world here!
Louis: Fish and chips for breakfast, to energize you in the morning. Fish and chips for tea, beloved by all the children...
Louis: And do I need to mention fish and chips for a walk through town? Their crispness and fragrance are praised by the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol Captain and seagulls alike!
Louis: Why, I cannot imagine what would become of Fontaine if fish and chips did not exist!
