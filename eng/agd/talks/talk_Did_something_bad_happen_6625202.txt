Traveler: Did something bad happen?
Toltec: "Something bad," you say... I could easily come up with a whole basket of that stuff.
Toltec: You know, we have plenty of tribespeople who help escort Iktomisaurs to read the trends of the Ley Lines and phlogiston â€” including me, and I'm one of the better-spoken ones.
Toltec: Honestly speaking, our ley Lines seem to be falling further and further below "healthy," and the Abyss is a threat that cannot be taken lightly...
Toltec: But I suppose life isn't all bad, eh? Always one or two things that can make you happy, and all that.
Toltec: When I feel down, I just hang out in our tribe's trophy room, focusing on the woven scrolls and paintings.
Toltec: Even if it's not for work, it's still a great pastime.
