# Missing title (1868299071)


## Talk 1

Magnifico (???): *cough* Help... Help me...

## Talk 2

#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Hroo...? Rawr! Raaawr!
Magnifico (???): Any... Anyone there?
Paimon: Hey, did you hear that? Sounds like someone's calling for help!

## Talk 3

Black Screen Text: You figure out a way to help the thirsty person, and you notice that his body seems to have grown a size bigger after getting some water in his system.
Magnifico: Phew... *cough* *cough* Thank you... But... *cough* You could have saved me a bit less... aggressively... I can't swim, you know...
Paimon: Don't worry, we'd have figured out a way to reel you back in in time!
Magnifico: I'd rather you not do any such thing on the fly, but regardless... thank you for saving me!
Magnifico: Magnifico de la Magnificans. Just "Magnifico" will do. As you can see, I am of noble Fontainian stock.
Magnifico: My old friends sometimes call me "The Detective," at times "Brutus," and sometimes "Mr. Mag"... But you two may call me whatever you wish.
Paimon: This guy's kinda strange, don'cha think?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Hroor...
Traveler: What's with "The Detective"?
Magnifico: I once worked at the Marechaussee Phantom as a detective for a few years, working on several major cases with Inspector Frank Drebin. He eventually made Superintendent, while I retired.
Magnifico: Ah, those were unforgettable days...
Magnifico: A boy met a girl, the boy lost the girl, the girl searched for the boy, the boy forgot the girl, the boy remembered the girl, and the girl was crushed under one of the pretty Fontinalia Festival floats three times...
Paimon: Okay, you can stop with your weird flashbacks now...
Magnifico: *cough* Anyway, after retiring from the Marechaussee Phantom, I was idle for a time, before deciding to become a photographer, capturing the vitality within people and objects...
Magnifico: That is why I am here in Natlan — home to the most shockingly dazzling elemental life forms!
Paimon: Perhaps the most "shocking" thing of all is the way you almost bit it, right here...
Magnifico: Hehe, and you have my apologies for that. I will not forget that you saved my life.
Magnifico: How about this... Let me mark the spot I'm going to next on your map... Yes, right here.
Magnifico: Ah, wait... Where have my manners gone? I haven't even asked for your names yet!
Traveler: #I'm Traveler.
Paimon: #Call me Paimon! And this here is {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Ehrroo!
Magnifico: #Wonderful, wonderful! Traveler... and Paimon. Names to remember, to be sure!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Ehrr? Roo? Raar—!
Magnifico: #Haha, relax, relax! I'll remember you too, {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}!
Magnifico: May we meet again soon in our respective journeys. Perhaps I might even need your help again... or perhaps you might need mine!
Paimon: You're going that far out... Well, mind you don't get too thirsty, alright?
Magnifico: Haha, there's no way I'd do that! Let's meet again, shall we?
Black Screen Text: Magnifico quickly packs his bags and water supplies, then waves you goodbye.
Not long after, his short silhouette disappears from sight.
Traveler: "Brutus," you say...?
Magnifico: Ah, you might not know this, but I used to be a detective with the Marechaussee Phantom for a few years, serving under Inspector Frank Drebin.
Magnifico: There was once when we saw five people in robes attacking an old man with knives in the park, right in front of over a hundred people! And then, "bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!"
Magnifico: Laid them all out, no exceptions. Hah! "Do you feel lucky, punk?"
Paimon: Whoa...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wrraaa...
Magnifico: Later, the chief of police told me that they were Research Institute administrative staff rehearsing "Remuria."
Paimon: Huh!?
Magnifico: Hence the name, "Brutus"!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Wooraarr?
Magnifico: It didn't matter, anyway. The Institute was cutting down on redundant staff at the time, so they'd have had to resign sooner or later.
Traveler: As for "Mr. Mag"...?
Magnifico: Why, it's my extraordinary charm, of course. Such magnetism is mine that all who know me are inexorably drawn to me!
Paimon: Ehh...?
Magnifico: Also... all unassuming metal objects, scattered Mora, small jewelry, and so on, will be inexplicably attracted to my pockets!
Paimon: Aren't you more like "Mr. Klepto," then!?
Magnifico: Indeed, and that is one of my clan's great virtues!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Eee—！

## Talk 4

Black Screen Text: You figure out a way to help the thirsty person, and you notice that his body seems to have grown a size bigger after getting some water in his system.
Magnifico (???): *cough* *pant* Haha, I see, so that was an Iktomisaurus trick... Just one of the reasons I'm here, if you must know.
Paimon: Alright, just take it easy and drink some water before we talk!
Magnifico (???): *cough* No, no, I'll be fine. Thank you for saving me!
Magnifico: Magnifico de la Magnificans. Just "Magnifico" will do. As you can see, I am of noble Fontainian stock.
Magnifico: My old friends sometimes call me "The Detective," at times "Brutus," and sometimes "Mr. Mag"... But you two may call me whatever you wish.
Paimon: That's... a whole load of random names. Suspicious, too!

Magnifico: Hehe, and you have my apologies for that. I will not forget that you saved my life.
Magnifico: Hmm.. Ah, yes. Could I have a look at your map for a moment? I'd... like to see where my next destination is—
Magnifico: Ah, wait... Where have my manners gone? I haven't even asked for your names yet!
Traveler: #I'm Traveler.
Paimon: #Call me Paimon! And this here is {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}!

## Talk 5

Paimon: But where is he? All Paimon sees is a child lying down here...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Ehrrr... Mrr? Rawr! Rawr!

## Talk 6

#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Ehrrr... Mrr? Rawr! Rawr!
Magnifico: *Water... Please, get me some water*... Thank you...
Paimon: Let's take a quick look at this guy. He's all laid out on the ground, and it doesn't look good!
