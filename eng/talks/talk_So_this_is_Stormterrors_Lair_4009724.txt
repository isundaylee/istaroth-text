Cyno: So this is Stormterror's Lair...
Cyno: ...From which direction will Stormterror appear, I wonder?
Mika: Um, excuse me...
Cyno: Who's there?
Mika: Ah, sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you.
Cyno: I apologize as well. I acted on force of habit. You must be a local, yes? My name is Cyno, and I'm here sightseeing in Mondstadt. In truth, it is I who am disturbing you.
Mika: Um, might I ask if you're looking for something here?
Cyno: I'm waiting for Stormterror to arrive.
Mika: You even set up a Kamera...
Cyno: Yes. I hope to capture a good picture as reference material for an artist I know.
Mika: Ah... In that case, let me help keep watch too. From what I've heard, Stormterror's movements have some... regular schedule.
Cyno: Roughly how often does it appear?
Mika: Uh, hold on. I'll have to check against our data first. Let me consult my notes...
Cyno: ...
Mika: ...
Mika: Um... Mr. Cyno, Sir, are you going to stand there staring into the sky the entire time?
Cyno: Don't worry, I'm quite strong. My neck can take it.
Mika: No, no, I mean... You should sit down. I—I brought a blanket — here, you can borrow it!
Cyno: I'll be alright.
Mika: Oh, um... okay, well...
Mika: ...Weird. Now I'm staring up into the sky, too...
