Traveler: Could you tell me more about Kannazuka?
Miyazaki Saburou: Kannazuka is disputed territory between the Shogunate and Sangonomiya. Actually, that place belongs neither to the Shogunate who worship the Raiden Shogun, nor to Sangonomiya, who worships Orobaxi.
Miyazaki Saburou: That's why this place is called Kannazuka, which means "the hill where no gods reside."
Miyazaki Saburou: At Kannazuka, if you walk past the camp in the east and head southwest, you will find yourself in Tatarasuna.
