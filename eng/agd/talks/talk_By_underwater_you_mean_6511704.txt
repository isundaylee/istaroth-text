Traveler: By underwater, you mean.
Thurel: Yes, I refer to the Fortress of Meropide.
Thurel: Well, it is true that those who have never been there would never use such terms as "above water" and "underwater" in that fashion. Few guards sent down there last very long.
Thurel: The environment there really cannot be called good, and there are conflicts between gangs of criminals, too, so we don't integrate well.
Thurel: I've heard that a new manager was appointed who laid down a great number of new rules that have made the guards' jobs much easier.
Thurel: But I'd long transferred out by then â€” Guess you could say that the timings didn't match up.
