# Bonds of Melody


## Talk 1

Paimon: Kaeya, you're fond of a good drink, aren't you? Weinlesefest must be right up your alley.
Paimon: Uh, Kaeya...?
Kaeya: Oh, I'm sorry, my mind was elsewhere... What was your question?
Paimon: Hmph, never mind. Nothing that important.

## Talk 2

Razor: *sniff*... This way.
Paimon: Oh! Paimon sees the cart, but what are these hilichurls doing here!? Do they want some fresh fruit now, too?
Paimon: #Traveler, to the rescue!

## Talk 3

Razor: ...
Paimon: Whew, finally. These hilichurls are a little too obsessed with food for their own good... But never mind that, are you okay? Did they hurt you?
Rolf: Phew... I'm fine, thanks to you. You were just in time. Any later, and all you'd have found here is a pile of pulp... and I don't think there'd be much left of the fruit, either.
Traveler: They're still waiting for you at the festival.
Rolf: Got it. Well, thanks again! I'd better not delay this delivery any longer, so goodbye and Happy Weinlesefest!
Rolf: Thanks to you, too, kiddo.
Razor: Mm.
Traveler: What is it, Razor?
Razor: Enemy following.
Rosaria: "Enemy"? Heh, I think we're a little closer than that.
Rosaria: On some level, you could even say that we're brother and sister.
Paimon: Rosaria! What the heck are you doing here?
Paimon: Wait... Actually, turning up at random places is pretty normal for you...
Paimon: Okay, next question: What the heck do you mean "brother and sister"?
Rosaria: Varka taught you how to use that sword, I take it? Swift but powerful. Heh, I can spot that old-timer's style anywhere.
Razor: ...
Rosaria: I see you're not much of a talker. Well, there's something else you could learn from Varka. Never lost for words, even when he has nothing to say... It'd be good conversation practice for you. Just a shame we have no idea when he'll be back.
Razor: It's okay. I will wait.
Paimon: Brother and sister...? Varka...?
Paimon: Oh! Paimon gets it. Varka is a father figure to both of them, so that makes them family — just not by blood.
Rosaria: Well, blood relations are overrated anyway, don't you think?
Traveler: I think the bond of blood is a strong one.
Rosaria: #Ah, I almost forgot. You have a sister.
Razor: Cold, dark grown-up... You also don't remember what your real mother and real father look like?
Rosaria: Huh... So you're helping him dig up some info on his biological parents? And trying to help him build a concept of family along the way?
Traveler: You could say that.
Rosaria: Alright, you got me.
Rosaria: I barely have any memories of my birth parents... The last time I saw them was long before I had any understanding of the world around me.
Rosaria: But that seems pretty common. Even in this day and age, there are plenty of people in the world who can't stop thinking about their families, but will never get to see them.
Rosaria: Anyway, if you're never gonna meet someone, it's not worth spending mental energy on them. It's more important to focus on the kind of person you want to become.
Razor: No! You are wrong about this.
Razor: Lupical protect each other. Human family also important. Must care about them.
Rosaria: ...Fine. So let's say you do find out who your parents were, and they were saints. Or the opposite, they were complete monsters. What then?
Rosaria: How would that affect your life choices? What would you do about it?
Razor: Ummm...
Paimon: Whew, Rosaria's take is a little on the nose... That's a hard one for Razor to answer.
Traveler: But it's normal to be curious.
Rosaria: Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to make this any more difficult than it already is. But Razor's feeling lost and confused right now, and all the other Mondstadters we know are too sunny and bright to tell it like it really is...
Rosaria: ...The sun nurtures many good things, but it can't do anything about the problems lurking in the shadows.
Paimon: Wow, Rosaria...
Rosaria: Alright, I'll leave it there. Take this flower, it's icy cold — just like me.
Rosaria: Barbara's busy preparing the sung poetry event for the Weinlesefest. She couldn't get away, so I picked an ingredient out on behalf of the church.
Paimon: But can we really use a Mist Flower? Won't it freeze the entire barrel?
Rosaria: No, not now that I've dealt with it. The bard did say to think "freedom," didn't he? So go on, take it. It won't be a problem.
Paimon: Aw, Rosaria, you're more thoughtful than Paimon realized...
Paimon: ...Uh, wait, you heard the bard say that? Were you spying on us!?
Razor: Thank you...
Rosaria: Don't mention it. It's nothing. Varka's been a big help to me in the past, so just consider it returning a favor. Besides... if I'm your older sister, I might as well act like it.
Rosaria: Good luck finding your answers.
Paimon: Now you see her, now you don't... Paimon's slowly getting used to her style.
Paimon: Oh well, as "love tender and true" goes, that was pretty awkward, but... still counts, right? Now all that's left is the Knights of Favonius.
Razor: ...
Paimon: Razor, are you still thinking about what Rosaria said?
Razor: Her words, are like Mist Flower. They are cold, and they sting.
Razor: But cold also good for wounds. Like Wolfhook.
Razor: I need to, think about it. Maybe then, I will understand.
Traveler: It'll take some time, there's no need to rush it.
Razor: Okay.
Razor: I will come with you. I think while we walk.
Traveler: We'll wait for you.
Traveler: The urge to know is understandable.
Traveler: Just gathering some reference material.
Traveler: ...Hard to say.
Rosaria: I get it. In the final moments of your life, the people there with you won't necessarily be your blood relatives.
Traveler: You seem a little...
Traveler: Keep your eyes peeled on the road.

## Talk 4

Lisa: ...So you see, you're the best person for this.
Kaeya: Oho, just in time. Lisa and I were just talking about Razor's situation.
Kaeya: Where were we... Ah, yes, the barrel!
Paimon: Huh!? But obviously, the knights part is supposed to be "a defender's will." But what kind of ingredient is a barrel?
Traveler: Obviously that's not what he meant.
Paimon: Oh... F—Fair enough...
Lisa: Hehe... Oh, Paimon, don't worry, you'll get your ingredient. I've already tasked someone with sorting it out.
Lisa: The person is very conscientious, and wants to properly research their contribution. So it may take some time, but hopefully it'll be worth the wait.
Lisa: As for the barrel... how else were you planning on mixing all the ingredients? Surely not in the giant cooking pot at Dadaupa Gorge?
Traveler: Ah, the memories...
Lisa: After much deliberation, I realized this was a job for the most sociable and savviest member in our ranks, the Cavalry Captain. So I asked him to take a trip to the Dawn Winery, and somehow bring back a wine barrel.
Kaeya: *sigh* Alright, spare me the flattery, Lisa. We're all friends here, and I know you're only trying to help your student.
Kaeya: ...But I haven't been back there in a long time. This could be quite difficult to accomplish in just a single trip.
Lisa: Difficult? For you? Don't be silly, negotiating is your biggest strength.
Lisa: Weinlesefest is one of the most important festivals in Mondstadt, and you know how Diluc thinks better than anyone.
Lisa: Just drop a few little hints, like how this is the first festival Mondstadt has had in a long time, we're short on much-needed supplies for a multitude of reasons... Oh, who can help us?
Lisa: When he hears that, I guarantee you he'll offer to help out with finances and sourcing goods.
Paimon: Lisa's literally trying to extort Master Diluc!
Kaeya: Hmm... I suppose. Alright, I'll head out right away.
Paimon: Wow, he didn't take much persuading!
Paimon: Ugh, and Paimon was just about to thank Lisa for the things she's been doing for Razor behind the scenes...
Paimon: Paimon doesn't even know whose side to be on anymore...
Razor: ...
Razor: #Traveler and teacher, did a lot for me. A lot of work.
Razor: But me... I still can't answer questions. So useless.
Lisa: Dear me, what's gotten you so upset, my little wolf cub? We can't have you being so down in the dumps.
Traveler: Some questions, he can't stop thinking about.
Lisa: Ah, I see.
Lisa: Hmm. Cutie, how about you keep Kaeya company while I stay here and help Razor process his feelings? As his teacher, I owe him some tutelage anyway.
Lisa: Come and collect him in a few days' time. The last ingredient should be ready by then as well.
Kaeya: Splendid. I was just thinking about how nice it would be to have some company on my trip.
Razor: I don't know what is right, but I trust Teacher. I accept.
Traveler: It's a plan then.
Lisa: Run along now, and don't forget to tell Diluc that the Knights of Favonius send our regards.
Traveler: Lisa, you're a godsend. Thank you.
Lisa: Well, aren't you a sweet one? But this is as much my business as yours. It's my pleasure, really.
Traveler: Maybe an information overload.
Traveler: That would be a "Suspicious Thousand-Wind Wine"...
Traveler: Seems entirely reasonable to me.
Paimon: Is your brain half-asleep or something? It doesn't make any sense at all!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Hi there, Master Diluc!
Diluc: Oh? I was just wondering who'd be coming all the way out here during the Weinlesefest. So it's you two.
Diluc: ...And you, too.
Kaeya: Brrr, so cold. Almost enough to make me feel unwelcome here, Master Diluc.
Kaeya: Don't forget that this is my home, too. I'm fairly certain that taking a trip home during festival season is a universal custom, common to all the cultures of Teyvat.
Diluc: Please get to the point.
Kaeya: The point is one that you've already raised yourself: the Weinlesefest.
Kaeya: To celebrate this long-awaited festival, the Acting Grand Master has been coordinating with both the church and the Adventurers' Guild to host a series of events.
Kaeya: Unfortunately, given the financial situation of the Knights of Favonius... Well, I'm sure you can imagine...
Diluc: And the Knights of Favonius's woes have what, exactly, to do with me?
Kaeya: Hey, no need to be so cruel. Even I'm not going to take that. Everyone's just doing the best they can for Mondstadt.
Kaeya: Now, I can't remember the last time I tasted Dawn Winery's Weinlesefest special... And I'm sure the Mondstadt populace would echo this sentiment.
Kaeya: Are you going to deny others the opportunity to drink to their hearts' content just because you don't like to drink yourself?
Paimon: Check it out, Kaeya's not-so-subtly asking for freebies... He's actually doing it...
Traveler: What a guy.
Kaeya: Anyway, speaking of the knights, everyone dearly hopes that you'll rejoin our ranks again one day. Then we'll be one big, happy family again.
Kaeya: If we were able to enjoy the sterling reputation of Master Diluc, my... I'm sure people would be queuing for our charity booth all the way to Falcon Coast...
Diluc: ...Hmph.
Diluc: Give that silver tongue of yours a rest. You might need it to maintain public order at the festival.
Diluc: Duly noted on the financial issues you raised. I'll have Elzer follow up with Hertha in more detail.
Diluc: And I just so happen to have a batch of wine that I can offer as a token of appreciation to everyone that has been working so hard for the festival.
Diluc: Shall I address it to you personally?
Kaeya: That would be an absurd request, even for me. The words "with compliments from the Dawn Winery" ought never be preceded by "To the Cavalry Captain." Is that not the unwritten rule?
Diluc: You're better informed than I thought. In that case, I will leave this with Adelinde and keep everything anonymous.
Kaeya: I really can't thank you enough.
Paimon: Master Diluc is so generous! That's all Paimon needs to get that warm, fuzzy feeling... which is just as well, since she won't be allowed to drink a drop.
Diluc: Are you two here regarding the Weinlesefest, too?
Traveler: Actually, we're here about Razor...
Black Screen Text: You tell Diluc that you're helping Razor to make Thousand-Wind Wine...
Kaeya: Poor Razor. He grew up so fast, and he's still looking for his father. Master Diluc, we really ought to lend him a hand.
Paimon: How come Klee said he's looking for his mom, but Kaeya says he's looking for his dad...? It might make more sense to them, but it's gonna get confusing for everyone else!
Diluc: It's okay. I understand.
Diluc: We have a spare barrel in the winery. It's a little old, but it's been specially treated for durability. You could leave it next to a Flaming Flower all day and there wouldn't be a scratch. I think that one should satisfy your needs.
Paimon: Sounds great, we'll take it! When can we come fetch it?
Diluc: No need. I'll have someone deliver it to the festival market. Just collect it from the Angel's Share stand.
Paimon: Ah, you always make things so nice and easy for us, Master Diluc! Hehe, thanks a lot. Razor will really appreciate it.
Diluc: You're more than welcome. Helping each other is what friends do.
Kaeya: Wonderful. Always eager to help, and never forgets to return a favor. That's the Master Diluc I know.
Diluc: ...It's nearly dinner time. Would you care to stay for a meal?
Kaeya: How time flies... I'll be on my way, then...
Diluc: Hmph.
Adelinde: How did you put it? Ah, yes: "Taking a trip home during festival season is a universal custom, common to all the cultures of Teyvat." Now that even Master Diluc has made an offer... Are you quite sure you won't stay for a meal after coming all this way, Master Kaeya?
Kaeya: I couldn't possibly, Adelinde. I wouldn't want to trouble you.
Adelinde: Oh, don't say that. How often do I get a chance to indulge my dear Master Kaeya, hmm? Tea for the Cavalry Captain when you visit in an official capacity doesn't count. I only get to spoil you if you'll let me cook for you.
Kaeya: Oh, uh...
Diluc: What happened to your swagger? Lost for words?
Kaeya: ...Ahaha... Diluc, you—
Diluc: Surely you wouldn't dream of disappointing Adelinde?
Traveler: The more the merrier.
Kaeya: ...Alright then. I'll take you up on the offer. Adelinde, one more set of cutlery, please, if you'd be so kind.
Black Screen Text: The group dines to the sound of Kaeya's jesting and Diluc's disapproving grunts...
Paimon: Oof, Paimon's so full... Adelinde's cooking is amazing. Everything looked and tasted so beautiful.
Traveler: Thank you for your hospitality.
Diluc: Glad you liked it. You're welcome to join again anytime.
Kaeya: #Oh? Then I may have to tag along on Traveler's adventures more often in the future.
Paimon: Ugh, Kaeya's back to his usual ways.
Kaeya: Alright, now that our task is complete and our bellies are full, it's time for me to get back to work.
Adelinde: Take care, Master Kaeya. Have a safe trip back.
Paimon: We should get going as well. Lisa's taking care of Razor, but the Weinlesefest can't do without us.
Paimon: See you next time, Master Diluc!
Diluc: Indeed. Goodbye.
Traveler: I enjoyed it as well.
Traveler: We need a barrel...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Marcel: We're going through a ton of fruit this Weinlesefest... I really need that cart to get here safely.

### Additional Talk 2

Razor: My heart, feels like, rotten berries. So sour.
Razor: I don't understand what I should do...
Lisa: Aw, alright. I'll teach you a very special magic trick that can make all your troubles disappear in the blink of an eye.
Lisa: But before we do that, let's warm up with something a little bit easier, hmm? Let's practice some talking.
Lisa: That way, the next time somebody helps you, or you have a different opinion from the rest of the group, you'll be able to express what you think clearly and precisely.
Razor: Okay!
Razor: I will do my best.

### Additional Talk 3

Diluc: Family, huh...
Diluc: ...
Diluc: Don't mind me. You should probably head back and get some rest.
Diluc: I'm not the most familiar with Razor, but you can contact me if you ever need help.

### Additional Talk 4

Adelinde: It's been a long time since I last saw Masters Diluc and Kaeya sharing a meal together. The atmosphere was... ahem, was not something that a maid of my lowly stature should be commenting on.
Adelinde: #Traveler, thank you so much for visiting. I hope to see you again soon.

### Additional Talk 5

Klee: Yay! Adventure! Treasure! Weinlesefest! Let's go, let's go!
Klee: Oh... wait, but what about Wolfie? Wolfie— uh, I mean Razor needs looking after. Honorary Knight, Paimon, you'd better take care of Razor, okay? Make sure he finds his mommy.
Razor: Mm...
Traveler: Leave it to us.
Razor: ...Good luck.
Bennett: See ya later, folks.
Paimon: Ah, it's so nice to see everyone in such a good mood.
Paimon: Oh...! Paimon almost forgot the whole reason we came here!
Paimon: #Razor, Traveler and Paimon were just chatting about the ingredients Venti mentioned in his poem. We think that they're actually a description of the wine's characteristics.
Paimon: Plus, it seems like each of them means something special to one of the three big institutions in Mondstadt. So, if we talk to some people we know at each place, maybe we'll find what you're looking for.
Razor: Hmm...
Paimon: What's wrong? Something on your mind? Do you want to talk about it?
Razor: Yes. These days, I think a lot.
Razor: #I am not... smart. Not like teacher, not like Traveler. But... I still have to think.
Razor: Everyone is ready to help, but... some things, I must do myself.
Razor: I don't understand human father and mother... but I must find a way to understand.
Razor: Maybe I can learn about other people's father and mother first, then think about my own father and mother.
Razor: That's why I want to ask questions.
Paimon: That's great! Keep at it, and you'll definitely find the answer eventually.
Razor: Never knew Bennett is... like me.
Razor: When he talks about "dads," his scent changes.
Razor: Warm, like a bed of straw in the sun.
Traveler: Let's find more people to speak to.
Paimon: Yeah! We should head back into the city. Let's find a friendly face at the Church of Favonius!
Paimon: Hmm, now who does Razor know best at the church...
Marcel: Excuse me, I couldn't help but overhear that you're about to head back into the city. Is that right?
Marcel: I'm waiting on a fruit cart from the city. It should be here now, but... I'm getting worried that something may have happened on the way, but I can't leave the festival to check up on it...
Marcel: Would you be able to do me a huge favor, and keep an eye out for the cart on your way back?
Paimon: Ummm... Well, if it's on the way...
Razor: Okay, we go. I go too.
Razor: Everyone helps me. Now I have chance, to help everyone.
Marcel: That's wonderful, thank you so much!
Traveler: Be careful.
