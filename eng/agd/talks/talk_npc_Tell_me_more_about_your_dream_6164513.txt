Traveler: Tell me more about your dream.
Sansa: My parents were extremely resistant to the idea of me being a bard. They were hoping I might be an academic, but I've never been the scholarly type...
Sansa: Those were the days when they'd lock me in my room and force me to study. The only joy I got was from hearing the bards sing outside the window.
Sansa: That got me interested, and then after I grew up, I just wanted to be a bard. Even if it meant falling out with my parents, I had to give it a try!
Sansa: Now, thanks to you, I no longer stammer when performing.
Sansa: I'll become a legendary bard in Mondstadt... One day!
