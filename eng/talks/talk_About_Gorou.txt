Traveler: About Gorou
Paimon: Hmm...
Traveler: What are you mulling over, Paimon?
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, do you remember Gorou's fluffy ears?
Paimon: Paimon really wants something like that... Or maybe horns similar to the ones Ganyu has. Ganyu's horns are pretty cute as well.
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, do you have any ideas?
Traveler: Let me see, hmm... Oh, I found something!
Paimon: #Really? Aw, {NICKNAME}, Paimon always knew you were reliable!
Traveler: Ta-da! I present to you the Tusk of Monoceros Caeli!
Paimon: Paimon doesn't need that!
Paimon: *sigh* If Paimon can't have Gorou's fluffy ears, then maybe at least something like his fluffy tail...
Traveler: Bubadada! Here you go â€” Tail of Boreas!
Paimon: ...Not that! Also, combining those two is definitely not the look Paimon is going for!
