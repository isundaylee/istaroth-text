# A Visitor From Westward Realms: The Flavor of Freedom


## Talk 1

Paimon: Huh? Looks like Sara's talking to someone over there. Might they be discussing food?
Paimon: C'mon, let's go over there! Paimon's not gonna miss out on some good grub, not for the world!

## Talk 2

Nazafarin: Ah, Lesser Lord Kusanali be praised! My thanks to you two, many thanks indeed!
Traveler: Could you remind me how to use this pot again?
Nazafarin: Right, yes, of course. A great hero such as yourself is rather busy, after all, perhaps too busy to remember such things. I did not consider that.
Nazafarin: It's actually quite simple. You simply need to add the correct seasonings at the right time.
Nazafarin: I'm sure you'll work it out once you try it.
Traveler: See you.
Nazafarin: See you. Once again, you have Nazafarin's utmost thanks! May this go smoothly for you.
