# Commence! A Suspect Genesis


## Talk 1

Paimon: It's been a while since we last played cards at The Cat's Tail... Wonder how Diona's doing?
Paimon: Well, since we have some time on our hands, let's go check up on her!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hmm, who could it be?
Charlotte: One of your rich friends, I'd assume. After all, you gotta be pretty well-off to live in the city, right?
Paimon: That still doesn't really narrow it down... We know lots of people with lots of Mora...
Charlotte: Wow... I guess being a national hero earns you friends in high places...

## Talk 3

Paimon: Huh... You seem like you've done this before. Do you spy on people often?
Charlotte: Haha, you're too kind. You should see the celebrities in Fontaine — the lengths they'll go to to try and avoid the public eye... Compared to that, this is nothing.
Paimon: That wasn't supposed to be a compliment!

## Talk 4

Adrian: Help! Someone save me!
Paimon: What are the Treasure Hoarders doing so close to the city?

## Talk 5

Charlotte: Here we are! Wait here a moment, I'll go hand over the cash.
Paimon: Huh? Oh, so it's...
Mona: #Who is it? Can I help you? ...Oh, {NICKNAME} and Paimon, what brings you here? And... I'm sorry, I don't believe we've...
Charlotte: You must be Mona Megistus, the Astrologist. It's an honor to finally meet you.
Charlotte: I'm Charlotte, a reporter from The Steambird. Your columns have been so well-received by our readers lately that our management asked me to present you with this cash bonus.
Paimon: She got Mona's full name and title right on her first try... She really does do her homework!
Mona: Ah, you must be Charlotte? Welcome, welcome... Please, just call me Mona. Gosh, this is a long way to come from Fontaine. I hope it wasn't too much trouble...
Charlotte: No trouble at all. It was on the way.
Paimon: Wow, sounds like your articles are a real hit with readers all over Teyvat, Mona!
Mona: Hmm? Have I never told you? I've been writing my column "All Things Astrological" for The Steambird for a long time now.
Mona: The chief editor wrote to me a while ago about the bonus. Thank goodness it's finally here, I was wondering when it would arrive. Thank you, Charlotte...
Charlotte: Huh, you make it sound like you really needed this... Are you pressed for money, Mona?
Mona: What? No, of course not! It's just that once I knew the bonus was coming, I re-allocated some funds that I'd previously set aside for daily necessities, and purchased some expensive equipment... That's all.
Paimon: Hehe, classic Mona...
Charlotte: Aha, perfect! "Renowned Astrologist Broke and Starving — Do the Stars Really Have All the Answers?" ...The article practically writes itself!
Traveler: Actually, that does sound like an interesting read.
Mona: ...Aw! I beg your pardon!?
Paimon: Mona's actually super rich — it's just that astrology research is really expensive.
Mona: #"Super rich" is a bit of a stretch... Ugh, anyway, enough about that. What brings you back to Mondstadt this time, {NICKNAME} and Paimon?
Paimon: Originally, we just came to catch up with a friend of ours... but some things have come up, and now we're helping Charlotte investigate the case of the Card Snatcher.
Charlotte: Speaking of which, will you be competing in the King of Invokations Grand Prix? Word is that the prizes are pretty stellar.
Mona: I'm much too busy with my research these days to dedicate time to a competition. Besides, even if I did enter, there's no guarantee I'd actually win a prize, is there?
Charlotte: Isn't there? I'd have thought you'd be certain to win with astrology on your side. You'd know all of your opponents' cards ahead of time.
Mona: What do you take me for? No self-respecting astrologist would dream of abusing their beloved art for such crude purposes. Besides, it wouldn't be fair to the other contestants.
Charlotte: Well said. Spoken like an accomplished academic and a conscientious citizen.
Mona: Well yes, obviously. Anyway, if past precedent is anything to go by, you're the ones who ought to be wary of what's around the corner. Especially if you're chasing after this... Card Snatcher, was it? Sounds like bad news — shall I take a glance at what you're up against?
Charlotte: Thanks for the offer, but there's no need. Relying on your astrological skills for all the juicy details would make this story a Mona-exclusive... but that's not quite the kind of exclusive report I'm going for here.
Charlotte: But don't you worry — they call it "investigative journalism" for a reason... We journos have our ways!
Mona: Alright. Well, best of luck with your investigation then. Thanks again for bringing the bonus, Charlotte. Do give my regards to the chief editor.
Traveler: Take care of yourself, Mona...
Mona: I will — and yes, we should. I'll hold you to that.
Charlotte: I think it's about time we started heading to the competition venue. The Mondstadt regional final should be starting shortly.
Paimon: Alright! Paimon can't wait to find out who the finalists are.
Traveler: ...Also, we should play another game of Genius Invokation TCG sometime!
Traveler: Sounds a little exaggerated, don't you think?

## Talk 6

Paimon: Wow, so this is the venue, huh? Seems pretty lively here!
Kaeya: #Well, if it isn't {NICKNAME} and Paimon. What a rare surprise. Did you really come all this way just to watch Timmie and me in the final?
Paimon: Kaeya? You made it to the finals? Wait... What about your work with the Knights of Favonius? You'd better not be slacking off again...
Kaeya: Hey, c'mon now. That's no way to talk to a friend. Naturally, I wouldn't have considered entering the competition were I not already on top of my work.
Kaeya: Ah, enjoying a drink while playing a few rounds of cards... I can't think of a better way to relax outside of work, can you? Oh, just be sure not to tell Diona I said that.
Paimon: Well, since you're in the competition... Have you noticed anything suspicious going on so far? You know, like... people stealing other players' cards, that kind of thing?
Kaeya: Stealing cards, you say? I'm afraid I haven't seen anything of that sort — not while I've been playing, anyway. Why do you ask?
Paimon: Well, we just ran into this journalist from Fontaine, and she... Huh? Where'd Charlotte go? She was right here, wasn't she...?
Paimon: Grr... Paimon bets she snuck off to go find some tasty snacks for herself!
Kaeya: Journalist from Fontaine... Oh, you mean the one from The Steambird? I do recall seeing a Steambird reporter listed in the Knights of Favonius' visitor log.
Paimon: Yeah, that'll be her. She said that she saw a Card Snatcher at the tournament venue, so we're helping her investigate.
Kaeya: A "Card Snatcher"? ...Hmm, how very interesting. But, one question, Paimon... Are you sure that cards are really what this "snatcher" is after?
Paimon: Huh? What makes you say that?
Master of Ceremonies: Hello everyone, your attention please! The final is about to begin! Now, let's give a warm welcome to our two contestants!
Kaeya: Guess we'll have to leave it there. Let's continue this conversation another time.
Traveler: Good luck, Kaeya!
Kaeya: Thanks, Traveler.
Paimon: Go get 'em, Kaeya! We'll see you in a bit!
Paimon: #So {NICKNAME}, who do you think's gonna win?
Traveler: Pretty sure Timmie will win.
Paimon: Yeah, Timmie seems to be a pretty strong TCG player.
Paimon: Either way, whoever wins is bound to make headlines... Wait, speaking of headlines, isn't that Charlotte's job!?
Paimon: Huh... maybe she got caught up trying out all the delicious Mondstadt snacks? Let's go look for her.
Traveler: I think Kaeya will win.
Paimon: Yeah, Kaeya's quite the crafty one. He must have some tricks up his sleeve.
Traveler: Give it your best!
Kaeya: Don't worry, I will.

## Talk 7

Paimon: Charlotte! What happened? You just disappeared without saying anything!
Charlotte: Oh, I just didn't want to bother you while you were catching up with your friend.
Paimon: But Kaeya's one of the finalists. Don't you wanna interview him, or something? You did say you're supposed to be covering the competition...
Charlotte: Ehh, I could churn out that kind of soft news piece in five minutes if I had to. Personally... I'm more interested in those two.
Charlotte: From the moment things kicked off, they've been acting very strangely, like they're trying to stay out of sight... I'm sure they must be plotting something.
Paimon: Hmm? *gasp* You mean, there are two Card Snatchers!?
Charlotte: Shh! Keep your voice down! We don't want to scare them off! We need to wait until we've got something concrete, then we can use my Kamera to catch them in the act...
Charlotte: Huh!? Wait, where'd the other guy go?
Paimon: He's on the run!
Charlotte: After him!

## Talk 8

Charlotte: He's heading towards Mondstadt's side gate. Let's follow him, but quietly. We mustn't let him spot us.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Now he's heading away from the city. How long are we gonna follow him for?
Paimon: Ugh, at this rate, we're going to miss Kaeya and Timmie's match.

## Talk 10

Charlotte: Ah, there — looks like he's stopped. Let's sit tight and see what happens.
Paimon: Why'd he come all the way out here? Is he gonna hide something?
Paimon: And now he's crouching down with his hands above his head... Wait, Treasure Hoarders! He's in trouble!
Paimon: Quick, we need to rescue him!

## Talk 11

Paimon: Are you alright?
Adrian: Oh thank goodness! I thought it was all over for me.
Charlotte: Those Treasure Hoarders, did you know them? It sure looked like they were here just for you.
Adrian: Why would I know them!? I was just... uh, out for a walk. Minding my own business, and then the next thing I knew, I was surrounded!
Charlotte: Oh, really? Then why did they target you? It wouldn't be because of some dubious deal you were involved in at the tournament, would it?
Adrian: Huh? A deal? I, uh... I don't know what you're talking about.
Charlotte: Well that's a shame. You see, I'm a journalist, and I just happened to snap a picture of you and one other individual in the middle of a deal back at the tournament.
Charlotte: I was only going to ask you for an interview, but that was before you caused all this trouble... and now you're feigning ignorance of the deal in question...
Charlotte: Hmm, maybe I'm just wasting my time? Shall I just cut my losses and hand over the evidence to the Knights of Favonius?
Adrian: Whoa whoa whoa, no, please! I'll talk! But you gotta believe me, there's nothing shady going on, I swear!
Paimon: Wow, that was some serious bluffing on Charlotte's part... she didn't take any pictures at all.
Adrian: Back at the tournament, I was approached by some random guy who said that he wanted to buy a card back off me. I said, okay, how much are you offering... and when he told me the amount, my jaw practically hit the floor!
Charlotte: Really? What kind of card back was it?
Adrian: Uhh... Nothing special, I just picked it up at a general goods store. It had a treasure chest design on it. I only bought it because it was dirt cheap.
Adrian: This guy offered me three times what I'd paid for it, and handed me the Mora right then and there.
Adrian: I could hardly believe my luck, so I decided to head somewhere less crowded and check the Mora was real. That's when I ran into the Treasure Hoarders...
Charlotte: Did you ask him why he wanted to purchase this item from you?
Adrian: No, I didn't... Genius Invokation TCG has been getting pretty popular lately, and some people will pay good Mora to make their decks look flashy. It didn't strike me as that unusual.
Adrian: But after I gave him the card back, he let out a sigh of relief and said something about, uh... "That's all the Mondstadt ones. Next stop, Liyue," or something like that...
Charlotte: ..."Or something like that"? He either said that or he didn't, how certain are you?
Adrian: I'm positive! I know what I heard. Once the card was in his hands, he suddenly relaxed, like a huge burden had been taken off his shoulders. It was genuine relief! ...Could that card back really be as valuable as he thought?
Charlotte: That I don't know. But in the interests of your personal safety, I suggest you report all of this to the Knights of Favonius.
Charlotte: After all, you weren't doing anything against the law, were you?
Adrian: Right, yeah, no, that makes sense. I'll go speak to the Knights of Favonius right away.
Paimon: It sounds like that guy's just collecting rare card backs. Are you sure this is the person you're after, Charlotte?
Charlotte: Well, it definitely doesn't add up. You really think someone out there's going from nation to nation shelling out huge sums of money for a few card backs bought from a grocery store?
Charlotte: My gut tells me that there's more to this story than the card back alone. Hehe, this entire situation reeks of exclusive news!
Traveler: Do you think there's real treasure involved?
Paimon: Ooh, treasure! Maybe the card backs make a treasure map? You know, collect all the pieces, put 'em together, and they reveal where the treasure is buried!
Charlotte: Who knows... but wherever this leads, we're definitely onto something.
Charlotte: Even though I didn't manage to get a good look at his face, his physique and the way he moved were identical to the Card Snatcher I saw last time. I'm sure it's the same guy.
Charlotte: He was much more discreet this time, though. I guess he didn't want to risk trying anything with so many potential witnesses around.
Paimon: From the sounds of it, we need to head to Liyue next, right? Paimon can't wait — we have tons of friends in Liyue, too!
Paimon: But shouldn't we check in with Kaeya before we leave? Paimon at least wants to find out who won the final.
Charlotte: Good idea, let's go.
Traveler: Maybe it was designed by a famous artist?
Paimon: Oh, you mean someone like Albedo? Hmm, that would explain why only some people understand the true value.

## Talk 12

Master of Ceremonies: I hereby declare the winner of the Mondstadt regional final of the King of Invokations Grand Prix is... Timmie!
Paimon: Wow! Timmie won, that's amazing!
Kaeya: *sigh* I was beaten by the best. Timmie's a tough opponent — he had me on the back foot the entire time.
Traveler: There's always next time.
Kaeya: Haha, it's alright, you don't need to comfort me.
Kaeya: This must be the journalist from Fontaine you mentioned earlier. Charlotte, was it? Enchantée.
Kaeya: I'm Kaeya, Cavalry Captain of the Knights of Favonius. I trust you're enjoying your time in Mondstadt?
Charlotte: The pleasure is all mine. Mondstadt's reputation as the City of Song and Freedom is truly deserved. The mood here is simply delightful.
Kaeya: Haha, I'm glad you're liking it. By the way, I couldn't help but notice you all rushing towards the city's side gate earlier. Did you find something? I couldn't get it off my mind, even during the competition.
Black Screen Text: You tell Kaeya everything that happened...
Kaeya: Hmm, I see...
Paimon: So it seems we have an answer to Kaeya's question from earlier: What the Card Snatcher's really after is these card backs. But we still haven't figured out why he cares so much about them.
Kaeya: Hmm. Well, while I'd love to accompany you all to Liyue Harbor, I'm afraid I still have my Knights of Favonius duties to attend to.
Kaeya: In fact, our top priority right now is strengthening Mondstadt's defenses. Treasure Hoarder activity has been increasingly rampant lately.
Paimon: Hehe, don't worry, we'll keep you in the loop if we find anything. In fact, if Charlotte's journalistic instinct is on point, you'll probably be reading her exclusive report in The Steambird before long!
Kaeya: Wonderful. Then I look forward to reading all about it.
Charlotte: Haha, thanks for supporting quality journalism. Okay, let's take tonight off and head to Liyue Harbor tomorrow. It'll give me a chance to write down everything that's happened today.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon wanted to ask... See the two people on this poster? Are they the inventors of Genius Invokation TCG? They look so young!
Charlotte: Maybe, but very little is known about either of them.
Charlotte: Whether they've been living under a rock this whole time or just aren't interested in the fame, I don't know. But hardly anybody has ever seen them.
Kaeya: The poster's probably just an artist's impression to capture the general look and feel of the duo. Beyond that, I doubt it's very true to life.
Paimon: Sound like they're a couple of socially reclusive scholars. If Paimon were in their shoes, she'd be showing up to all the events, signing autographs, selling cards... and probably getting complimentary food and drink!
Kaeya: Haha, I approve. And to top it off, you could play a few rounds of Genius Invokation with everyone.
Charlotte: I was reading up on the game's inventors before I came to Mondstadt. I was originally hoping to arrange an interview with them.
Charlotte: But I soon discovered that there's no mention anywhere of where they live or of any Genius Invokation events that they've attended.
Charlotte: It's as if they designed the game and then never played it again.
Traveler: What a mysterious couple of game designers.
Kaeya: Either they don't want to play the game, or they're unable to. But they must have their reasons.
Charlotte: I wonder if they'll show up at all during the King of Invokations Grand Prix...
Kaeya: #Maybe, if you get lucky... and based on my experience, {NICKNAME} seems to have no shortage of that.
Charlotte: Oh really? Well, that gives me one less thing to worry about.
Traveler: Hearing that that put you at ease puts me at ease.
Charlotte: Anyway, our focus is still on tracking down the Card Snatcher.
Charlotte: I heard Snezhnaya has an old saying: "If you try chasing two rabbits at once, you'll only end up empty-handed."
Paimon: #Well... {NICKNAME} and Paimon can always split up and chase one rabbit each!
Paimon: Okay, now Paimon's feeling hungry. We can worry about all this later — right now, it's time to get some grub.
Kaeya: Haha... You can always trust Paimon to know where life's priorities lie. If it's food you're after, I recommend taking a look at the nearby stalls.
Kaeya: The tournament has brought quite a crowd, so there's a lot of fun to be had around the venue.
Paimon: Sounds great! Thanks, Kaeya!
Traveler: Hopefully my luck won't run out any time soon...
Traveler: At least you are gracious in defeat.
