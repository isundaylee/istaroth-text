# For Yesterday and Tomorrow


## Talk 1

Paimon: Este, we're back!
Este: Oh, if it isn't... Wait, no. Who are you?
Paimon: #Huh? You can't have forgotten us already! We're {NICKNAME} and Paimon!
Este: #{NICKNAME} and Paimon... I have indeed heard tell of these names, but I could've sworn I heard them in a dream!
Paimon: Uh... But you were definitely awake then, Este! Also, while we were below, didn't we even see...
Este: *sigh* I dreamed that everyone in town was petrified, turned into statues of stone, leaving me utterly helpless and alone.
Este: Until finally, two brave heroes came and shouldered the burden of rescuing everyone... Could it be, that it was no dream at all?
Traveler: Maybe, maybe not.
Paimon: Yeah. After all, everyone's back to normal now, aren't they?
Este: But it seems as though everyone had some very strange dreams indeed. Just what happened? Could we all have been hypnotized en masse?
Paimon: It would take us ages to explain it all properly... Just forget about the hypnosis thing for now!
Este: Oh? Speaking of hypnosis, you two even brought over a cat! It looks quite intelligent.
Traveler: He's even smarter than he looks.
Paimon: And moreover, he's our companion! But unfortunately, we can't take him with us on our journey...
Este: Well now, isn't that a coincidence? Our club just happens to have an open bed for cats available. It's been unoccupied ever since that hypnosis researcher went a-traveling and took his cat with him.
Este: If you two don't mind, leave him here with us. We'll take care of him.
Este: Though I can't quite put my finger on it, I feel like we're bound up together, almost as if by fate. I'll help you take very good care of him indeed.
Este: The cattery is on the other side of the building. Just walk over and you'll see it.
Traveler: He's our companion.
Paimon: That's true, but we still can't take him with us on our journey...
Traveler: That's not important.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Hey, this'll be your home from now on, Osse!
Osse: Meeeow?
Paimon: Still, it feels a bit weird. Cassiodor should've already left here, right? So who is Osse now?
Paimon: Is it the original cat that hadn't been indwelt by Cassiodor, or is it the Monsieur Os that shared all those adventures with us...? Ugh, Paimon's brain is cramping up.
Traveler: Paimon, you're really not suited to thinking about stuff like this.
Paimon: Paimon doesn't get it at all...
Paimon: Anyway, we've found a new home for Osse now, too! If we've got time, maybe we can come play with him!
Osse: Meow meow!
Traveler: "Osse" is "Osse."
Paimon: Though Paimon still doesn't get it, it does make a certain kind of sense...
