Traveler: Death and failure...
Cauich: Haha, you might not know this, but here, even warriors who fail have a chance to start over.
Cauich: As long as you've got an Ancient Name as I do, and the companions who fight alongside you succeed, you can return to the battlefield even should you fail.
Cauich: To be honest, I've had experience... You know, being dead. Wasn't fun, but fortunately, I wasn't alone.
Cauich: *sigh* It's just a shame I'm getting on in years... But perhaps, one day, my Ancient Name will carry my story on and find itself a new bearer.
