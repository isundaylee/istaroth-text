# Crystalline Bloom

An ice crystal of exceeding purity that is created in the frigid blooming of a Cryo Hypostasis.
These frosty crystals will continue to grow according to their own cold, rigid laws, till one day a flower of winter shall bloom and freeze everything. Perhaps it is stagnant time, that never-thawing bosom, that is the essence of this undying flower.
