Traveler: ...Katheryne?
Katheryne: That's right. I am Katheryne, the receptionist here at the Adventurers' Guild.
Katheryne: It's my job to assign quests to our adventurers and provide intelligence support. Our service is all year round.
Katheryne: Is there something wrong, Adventurer? You seem... surprised?
Traveler: ...What are you doing here?
Katheryne: I'm sorry, I don't quite understand your confusion?
Katheryne: All Guild members should be well aware that Katheryne is the receptionist of the Adventurers' Guild. The Liyue branch can't go without a receptionist, can it?
Katheryne: Therefore, Katheryne is here.
Katheryne: ...Do you have any further questions?
