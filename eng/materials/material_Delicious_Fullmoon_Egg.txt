# Delicious Fullmoon Egg

One of Liyue's traditional snacks. Take a bite while it's hot, and have your tastebuds savor the tender minced meat and delicious juice, an experience which is then topped off with a finishing touch of sweet prawn. Before your eyes, you can almost see a full moon over rippling waters, a fishing boat by the shore, and the fishermen's songs echoing down the years.
