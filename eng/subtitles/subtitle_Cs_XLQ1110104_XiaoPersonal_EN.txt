In ancient times, Liyue was a land of misery, where the shadow of evil loomed large
As slain gods festered
Their vengeful wrath cursed the world, manifesting in infernal forms
When demons stirred
Miasmas, monsters, and mutations infested the land
Then, Rex Lapis summoned the Yakshas to vanquish the demons
They swore an oath: "Restore order through slaughter"
"Purge evil through battle, to this we dedicate our lives"
Eons of bloodshed later
Karmic debt weighed upon them, phantom wrath seeping into their broken souls
They went mad with fear
Turned on each other
Or succumbed to the darkness
Of the five foremost Yakshas
Death came to three, while the fourth vanished without a trace
In the millennia since
One Conqueror of Demons remains the sole surviving Yaksha in the mortal realm
And only on moonlit nights
In the glow from Guyun and in the sound of the Dihua flute
Is his memory preserved
