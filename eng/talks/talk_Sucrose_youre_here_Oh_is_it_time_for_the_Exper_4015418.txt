Paimon: Sucrose, you're here! Oh, is it time for the Expert exam already?
Paimon: Our alchemy skills are improving so fast, Paimon can barely keep up!
Sucrose: Your progress has been very impressive. In fact, according to the way Mr. Albedo designed the exams, passing the Expert level would mean you're now qualified to mentor other people.
Paimon: Ooh, we could start to teach other people?
Paimon: Then Paimon's totally going to start a class! Hmm, let's see, how much should Paimon charge per student...
Paimon: Well, all Paimon knows right now is that, for homework, her students are gonna have to use alchemy to make all sorts of tasty treats, hehe. Paimon'll be sure to give them lots of feedback... on their alchemy skills, of course!
Traveler: Paimon...
Sucrose: I'm sure this one will go just as well as the others.
Sucrose: I'm ready to begin whenever you are. I'll be rooting for you!
Traveler: Check the exam requirements...
Traveler: I still need a little more time...
Sucrose: Of course. This is the final exam. Take as much time to prepare as you need.
Traveler: Let's focus on the exam for now.
