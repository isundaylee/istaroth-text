# Missing title (3230720703)


## Talk 1

Permingeat: One moment please. Would you like to hear a secret about the treasure?
Traveler: What secret?
Permingeat: It has to do with treasure and the key to opening the gate. How does that sound? Interested?
Traveler: You're not asking me to fight monsters again, are you?
Permingeat: Of course not! We wouldn't dream of asking tavern guests to run errands.
Permingeat: See this naval artillery by my side and the rubble it's pointed at?
Permingeat: Activate the cannon and blow up those rocks, and any treasure you uncover is yours for the taking.
Traveler: Who on Teyvat named that cannon?
Permingeat: The helmsman did. I'm not entirely sure myself where he acquired it.
Traveler: Out with it. What parts are missing?
Permingeat: I think you've been misinformed, friend. The cannon is entirely intact and fully powered. I tend to it every day.
Permingeat: But before you activate the cannon, I would like you to answer several questions.
Permingeat: It's per the request from the helmsman. He called it a good source of amusement for guests at the tavern, something to slow down their drinking and keep them here longer.
Traveler: I'm not sure about this, but ask away.
Permingeat: Question 1: How many tables are there in The Rusty Rudder?
Permingeat: Question 2: How many employees do we have at The Rusty Rudder?
Permingeat: Question 3: What is not served in The Rusty Rudder?
Permingeat: That's it. You only need to answer these three questions correctly to activate the cannon, blow up the rubble, and get the treasure.
Traveler: What will happen after I get the treasure?
Permingeat: After that, I'll find the right time to place another suitable prize in the cave and seal it with rubble.
Permingeat: The treasure is waiting to be claimed once the next guest activates the artillery.
Traveler: That's a lot of work for you.
Permingeat: That's all. You may look for the answers now. Meanwhile, I'll stay here and wait for you.
Traveler: Talk about a horrible boss.
Permingeat: I find it hard to disagree with your remark, but I have yet to find a way to point the cannon at the helmsman without him detecting it.
Permingeat: Besides, rashly shooting in the wrong direction may harm other guests at the tavern, which stands in conflict with my moral principles.
Traveler: Out with it. How is it powered?
Traveler: You're not asking me to find someone or something for you again, are you?
