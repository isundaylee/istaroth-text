Traveler: Did you come from Liyue?
Yuewen: Yes, I did. You can get to Port Ormos by traveling along the waterway.
Yuewen: I just unloaded a batch of cargo there and made a little money, so I planned to rest in Vimara Village for a while before traveling back to Liyue.
Yuewen: But I realized this place is such a paradise to relax in... I really can't bear to leave.
