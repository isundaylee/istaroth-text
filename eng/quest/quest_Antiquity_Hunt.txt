# Antiquity Hunt

Daneh: Ugh, why does everyone seem so exhausted...
Traveler: Are you running some sort of event here?
Daneh: You're the Traveler, aren't you? Haha! I've always wanted to meet you.
Daneh: That's right. Vahumana is running an archaeology-themed game this time!
Daneh: We have many researchers who study history under our banner, and so archaeological work, especially the sort that is done in person, is often unavoidable.
Daneh: Wait, wait, don't be nervous. We're not getting everyone to do that in person. This event is just a replica of archaeological "activities."
Daneh: We have placed a lot of replica relics and buried them all around Sumeru City, and we term those places, at least for now, our Archaeological Zones.
Daneh: Those who take part in this activity just need to bring our specially-made detectors to those sites and dig up the buried replicas.
Daneh: It's all thanks to the students of the other Darshans for constructing a batch of containers and corresponding detectors.
Daneh: What do you think, Traveler? Would you be interested in giving this a go?
Traveler: Doesn't sound too hard...
Daneh: Hahaha, great! In that case, here's a detector! I'll mark the Archaeological Zones on your <color=#00E1FFFF>Archaeological Manual</color>.
Daneh: Alright, that should do it. Well then, Traveler, go out there and have yourself some archaeological fun!
Daneh: Once you've found all the relic replicas, do remember to come back and collect your reward from me.
Daneh: You just need to follow the detector in order to find the replicas. We've even split the types of replicas into zones according to the elements.
Daneh: However... These detectors were originally used in elemental surveys, and despite our last-minute modifications, they might still be affected by certain elements.
Daneh: All in all, you just need to dig up all the replicas, and you'll find that we've got awesome rewards for you!
Traveler: We could give it a go...
