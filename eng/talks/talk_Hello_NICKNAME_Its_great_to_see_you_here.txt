Khedive: #Hello, {NICKNAME}! It's great to see you here.
Traveler: What are you doing here?
Khedive: A field study, to record and research ancient life forms and their remains. Well, and I'm also here to observe the abnormalities in the geological layers.
Paimon: And you're not going down there yourself?
Khedive: Me? Go down there? No, of course not.
Khedive: I mean, I did pay for this exploration team to be set up. I'll fork out the Mora, you do the work. My research gets done, you get paid. I'm happy, you're happy. See?
Khedive: That's how that works.
Paimon: ...This guy is really annoying.
Traveler: Bye.
Khedive: Well, don't let me keep you too long.
