## Talk

Davy: Ah, everything is so fresh and clear out in the wild. I'm so much more inspired here...
Davy: My work will be far greater than the nonsense that woman comes out with!

## Talk

Traveler: Which woman?
Davy: You'll probably run into her if you go to Springvale... She's my ex-wife, Myweiss. A bard, just like me.
Davy: I'm convinced the only reason I ever looked her way is because I bashed my head when Stormterror attacked!
Davy: Can you believe they used to call us Mr. and Mrs. Lovebard? It's so nauseating now that I think back on it.
Davy: But the worst thing of all is her original compositions...
Traveler: Tell me about her work.
Davy: Well. After the divorce, she started using her compositions as a way of stirring up controversy... Pfft. I, for one, do not consider anything she writes to be true poetry.
Davy: She will do whatever it takes to smear my name... and that's when she was the irresponsible one who never contributed to the home!
Davy: For example, we had a clear agreement that we would take it in turns to do the cooking and the housework. But every time I got back from a performance, she was never there. So I ended up cooking all the meals and doing all the housework myself!
Davy: At least I understand now — love is a big old hoax!

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Davy: Goodbye! Come and listen to my new ballad when it's ready — it's called the Manacles of Matrimony.

## Talk

Traveler: Is there anything of note nearby?

## Talk

Davy: Hmm, nothing especially noteworthy for a traveler, I'd say. Not recently, anyway. ...Except for my singing, of course.
