# Talk Dialog

Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Hu Tao: Hmm... something I want to do... I already do what I want every day.
Hu Tao: So today, I won't tend to any of that other nonsense. I'll just hang out here.
Hu Tao: Your place has mountains and bodies of water, food and fun, and I get to hang out with you... How wonderful!
Traveler: You really like this place.
Hu Tao: Well it's not just the place, silly... I mean lots of places have courtyards and pavilions! Why would I like the place, of all things?
Hu Tao: Hmm let's see... what else is there to like? Well, of course it's... it's... guess!
Hu Tao: Hee-hee! That look on your face... I'll stop teasing you.
Hu Tao: I like hanging out with you. And the fact that you're here with me proves that you like hanging out with me too!
Traveler: I figured as much.
Hu Tao: Hee-hee, no matter what you say, I'm staying here today and no one can drag me away!
Hu Tao: We have such a good relationship, so... surely you won't mind?
Traveler: You really don't mean what you say, do you?
