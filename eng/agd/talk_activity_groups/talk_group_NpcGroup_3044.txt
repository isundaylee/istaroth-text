## Talk

Kiminami Anna: Hello! Welcome to Kiminami Restaurant, the first and last stop for gourmet culture in Inazuma.

## Talk

Traveler: Can I get some food to go?
Kiminami Anna: Take your pick â€” I'm very proud of each and every one of these.

## Talk

Traveler: What is this place?
Kiminami Anna: This is Kiminami Restaurant. I, the future owner Kiminami Anna, run the place right now. Our restaurant has inherited the cooking skills of the royal head chef of the Shogunate. You could even say that we are the face of fine Inazuman cuisine.
Kiminami Anna: But let me just preface everything by saying that we've been short-staffed ever since my father disappeared, so you'll have to wait for a while if you wish to dine-in. We have lemon water with unlimited refills available in the meantime.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Kiminami Anna: Come back next time! I'll be even better then.

## Talk

Kiminami Anna: Hello, you must be Miss Kamisato's friend! Come in! Would you like to try the new dish that I just learned?

## Talk

Traveler: Can I get some food to go?
Kiminami Anna: I have already learned the recipe you gave me previously, and I've added it to the menu. Otherwise, take your pick.

## Talk

Traveler: How have things been lately?
Kiminami Anna: I have learned some new recipes since we last met. The new products I made have even been approved by my mom.
Kiminami Anna: Once my cooking skills are as good as my grandpa's were back when he was working as the royal head chef of the Shogunate, I will probably be able to take over this restaurant.
Kiminami Anna: My father will be stunned when he gets back, oh yes he will, indeed!
Kiminami Anna: Oh right, you can also invite Miss Kamisato here too. If it's you asking, I think she will definitely agree to come, hehe.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Kiminami Anna: Goodbye! Come back soon.

## Talk

Traveler: About your father...
Kiminami Anna: I suppose I should start from the beginning here... A long time ago, my father came to Inazuma as a foreign gourmet foodie. He was very impressed by the local culinary scene, so he volunteered to be a kitchen assistant at this restaurant.
Kiminami Anna: Later on, my father married into the Kiminami Clan. After my grandfather had been called by the Shogunate to become the head chef, he and my mom started to run Kiminami Restaurant together.
Kiminami Anna: I've been learning how to cook since I was little. I was supposed to take over Kiminami Restaurant when they retired. But my father suddenly disappeared last year without leaving a trace.
Kiminami Anna: That's how I started cooking in the restaurant to help my mom.
Kiminami Anna: Hmm... Although I've learned a lot, I'm still far from being on grandpa's level. I have to become better still if I want to take over this restaurant.
Kiminami Anna: If you have any feedback for me after trying out the food here, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Kiminami Anna: *sigh* What am I to do...
Traveler: What happened?
Kiminami Anna: Traveler? Great, you have perfect timing!
Kiminami Anna: Do you remember the recipe you wrote for me the last time, when you and Ms. Kamisato came to my store?
Kiminami Anna: Oh, that pizza was so popular that many customers came to the store to order it specially.
Kiminami Anna: But... some customers also said that they were bored of eating this pizza all the time and asked if I have other pizza flavors.
Kiminami Anna: Although I have tried several methods to make new types of pizza based on feedback from customers...
Kiminami Anna: But I always feel... that something is lacking, and the response from customers is not very good.
Kiminami Anna: *sigh* Maybe I'm really not good at making pizza...
Kiminami Anna: Traveler, you know a lot about this dish, right? Can you give me some advice?
Traveler: You got it!
Kiminami Anna: Great! By the way, I've also collected feedback from customers. Give me a moment, I'll look for it.
Kiminami Anna: Miss Rie said that although the taste of this pizza is not bad...
Kiminami Anna: But she felt that the pizza would taste better if it incorporated some of Inazuma's local ingredients.
Kiminami Anna: I wonder what ingredients she would like to see... Traveler, please help me ask her.
Traveler: About the customers' feedback...
Kiminami Anna: Do you want to take a look at the customer feedback?
Kiminami Anna: Give me a moment, I'll look for it.

Kiminami Anna: Miss Matsumoto said that although the pizza in my shop incorporates a lot of ingredients from Inazuma, she heard that Mondstadt pizza is not made like this.
Kiminami Anna: She said that for such outland delicacies, it's better to retain it's authentic flavor...
Kiminami Anna: *sigh* But how am I going to know how to make Mondstadt's pizza? Traveler, please help me ask her.
Traveler: About the customers' feedback...
Kiminami Anna: Do you want to take a look at the customer feedback?
Kiminami Anna: Give me a moment, I'll look for it.
