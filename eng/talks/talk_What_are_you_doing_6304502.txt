Traveler: What are you doing?
Shouta: I've heard that I can make a wish to the archon once I have placed the offering in the shrine. If the archon likes my offering, my wish will definitely be granted.
Shouta: I have brought all of my snacks here today, and I'd like to wish that the archon will cancel the exam tomorrow!
