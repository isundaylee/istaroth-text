Life is like fishing
It cannot be rushed
Whatever you do, impatience will accomplish nothing
I was just like you once
Desperate to prove myself
Only later did I realize
Things do not always turn out the way you plan
But you have to keep calm to carry on
You're still young. Be patient
Believe in yourself
And don't look outside yourself to prove your value
...Where's Zhiyi these days?
It's been a long time since he last paid me a visit
Maybe he's just busy...
Hmph, well next time
If he doesn't bring a pot of piping hot fish soup, don't let him in!
Whatever you were thinking about, you'll have plenty of time to mull it over in prison
Oh, I almost forgot
If the Fatui find out what happened today
Prison might not turn out to be the safest place for you
Trying to have friends on both sides... it has a way of turning everyone against you
But right now
I have an opportunity for you
