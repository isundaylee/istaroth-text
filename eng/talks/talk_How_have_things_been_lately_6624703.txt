Traveler: How have things been lately?
Inkanak: Welcome back to the Flower-Feather Clan. Everything's going well here!
Inkanak: We were in a rough spot before, but good thing we had formidable folks like you and Chasca around â€” it all worked out in the end.
Inkanak: I also get that some of my proposals are a little too focused on efficiency over safety...
Inkanak: But somehow, they always wind up getting picked up and implemented by people like yourself, so I guess I'm just lucky like that.
Inkanak: Are you saying that it's human nature to tackle challenges head-on?
