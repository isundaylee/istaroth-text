# Gathering of Stars

Farbal: I hope everyone will enjoy this little gadget...
Traveler: What's there to play over here?
Farbal: You're... the Traveler, aren't you? I'm Farbal, from Rtawahist.
Farbal: Um, I don't suppose you know what it is we study here, do you?
Traveler: Huh. Well, I think it was...
Farbal: We study the stars... though that's not a very precise way of putting it. We do have a lot of specializations within the Darshan itself.
Farbal: Unfortunately, a lot of things about our research wouldn't make much sense to the average person if we just explained it as-is... In fact, the chances of them even being interested are slim.
Farbal: And I was concerned that setting up an astrology booth would just end in the involved students getting into academic discussions and not manning the stall.
Farbal: As such, after much discussion, we decided on a middle-of-the-road option.
Farbal: See this special astrolabe? Many stars have been placed on it, and what you need to do is arrange them into a specified image.
Farbal: These images will not be particularly complicated, and they will not involve any ongoing and as-yet-unresolved academic disputes.
Farbal: Ahem... So, uh... A simple, fun, and definitely not divisive pictorial puzzle!
Traveler: You strike me as being really nervous.
Farbal: Well, this game does have to do with the stars, after all. Some of our students get the sweats the moment they hear that word.
Farbal: You don't know how many people I had to tell that this is just a toy and has nothing to do with academic research...
Farbal: Never mind that. If you're interested, feel free to give it a go.
Traveler: I'd like to give this a try.
Farbal: Sure. The astrolabe is over here.
Traveler: I've got other matters to attend to at the moment.
Farbal: Well, I'll be here at the booth throughout the Gala. If you're of a mind to play, just hit me up.
