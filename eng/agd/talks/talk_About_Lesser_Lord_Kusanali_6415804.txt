Traveler: About Lesser Lord Kusanali...
Durgar: The fact that Sumeru people are living in a place where trees and flowers flourish instead of struggling amidst barren deserts is all thanks to the kindness of the Lord Kusanali.
Durgar: Greater Lord Rukkhadevata left roots and nutrients to Sumeru, which have now been inherited and protected by Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Durgar: So now, all our harvests are born from her mercy.
Durgar: And since I live by carpentry, which is closely related to trees, I am even more grateful to the Dendro Archon!
