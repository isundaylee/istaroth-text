# Glittering Street

A detailed step-by-step blueprint for making a "Glittering Street."
An urban area filled with goods and wares, from strange and precious treasures to everyday items, recreating the bustle of Liyue's markets.

Her true identity is unclear, but what is known is that most goods brought to her attention will soon appear on the markets.
