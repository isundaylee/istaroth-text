Traveler: Tell me about Watatsumi Omikami...
Eboshi: Watatsumi Omikami, due to ill-fortune, fell into this place, beyond the jurisdiction of the heavenly order.
Eboshi: But this was undoubtedly to the good fortune of us, the people of Byakuyakoku. It has done a great many things for us.
Eboshi: Unfortunately, by making contact with us, it also grasped a truth that came before its own existence. Thus, it was forced to seek a valiant death.
Eboshi: Thus, the people would no longer suspect that there might be secrets that lay hidden in the shadows. This was the only way the people of Byakuyakoku would be allowed to live under the rule of The Seven.
