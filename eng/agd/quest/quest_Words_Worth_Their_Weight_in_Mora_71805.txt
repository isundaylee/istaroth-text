# Words Worth Their Weight in Mora


## Talk 1

Jifang: Guess everyone's interested in history now, eh...
Traveler: What's the matter?
Jifang: A lot of people have become interested in Liyue's history recently, and many of them have been coming to my store to buy books...
Jifang: In the past, it would take half a year to sell the few copies of "Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti" that we had, so I stopped importing such obscure history books...
Jifang: But after the recent events that happened here, people from all over the city would come here to purchase history texts...
Jifang: These past few days have been full of customers who specifically wanted books containing Rex Lapis' stories.
Jifang: *sigh* Who knows if they really love reading, or if they're just looking to inject a bit of spice into their daily chatter...
Jifang: Due to the surge in demand, I've almost had no time to attend to some special orders that we've gotten from old customers.
Jifang: I finally found the time to put together the books that two such customers wanted, but I'm too busy to leave the store at the moment.
Jifang: Could you help me send this copy of "Verses of Equilibrium" to Uncle Tian, and this copy of "Rex Incognito (IV)" to Gentry De'an?

## Talk 2

Traveler: I'll do it.
Jifang: Thank you very much. They must surely be growing impatient by now. After all, they placed their orders a long time ago, but I've only just gotten around to putting those orders together...
Jifang: *sigh* With so many customers all of a sudden, I barely know how to keep up...

## Talk 3

Traveler: I'd love to, but I have to get going.
Jifang: No problem. I'll look for someone else to help me out.

## Talk 4

Gentry De'an: What is it, youngster?
Traveler: Here's the order you placed with Jifang.
Gentry De'an: The fourth volume of Rex Incognito? I placed this order eons ago. Why has it tarried till now?
Gentry De'an: Let me see. Huh? A first edition? Why, no wonder it took so long...
Gentry De'an: To think I'd assumed that Jifang had forgotten about my book amid all the other customers...
Gentry De'an: Thank you for delivering this book to me, youngster.

## Talk 5

Uncle Tian: What can I do for you, youngster?
Traveler: Here's the order you placed with Jifang.
Uncle Tian: The what now? ...Oh, ah yes. I believe I ordered a copy of the Verses of Equilibrium at the Wanwen Bookhouse.
Uncle Tian: Indeed, indeed, this is the book that I wanted. Haha, I was beginning to think that Jifang might have forgotten about my order, what with the other customers and all...
Uncle Tian: But it's here now, and that's good. The binding is fairly good as well. Conscientious as always, that Jifang.
Uncle Tian: Thank you, youngster. I'll take this with me, now.

## Talk 6

Traveler: So, about those two books...
Jifang: Have you delivered them?
Traveler: Yes, I have.
Jifang: Thank you. Wanwen Bookhouse has managed to stay open all this time due to the support of our long-time customers.
Jifang: What's more, these customers are true lovers of books. It should gladden them greatly to receive good ones.
Jifang: Thanks so much for your help, Traveler. Please take this as compensation for your efforts.
Jifang: If you should ever wish to purchase any books, feel free to approach me.

## Talk 7

Jifang: So, about those two books...
Jifang: The two of them are long-time customers of ours. I usually prepare their books beforehand.
Jifang: But I ended up dragging my feet a little this time due to the surge in business.
Jifang: They must have gotten impatient...
