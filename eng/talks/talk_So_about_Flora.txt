Traveler: So, about Flora...
Ulfr: You must want to know why I'm so nice to Flora?
Ulfr: Well... it's like this. My parents separated when I was very young, and I spent much of my childhood on my own.
Ulfr: I sometimes imagined what it would be like to have a sibling, and the way I imagined them is exactly how Flora is: light-hearted, bubbly, and carefree...
Ulfr: So, I just want to treat her like I would my own sibling, you know, do nice things for her.
Ulfr: It sounds stupid, I know, but I always wanted to go boating together as a family. My old man practically laughs till he cries whenever I mention it to him, though... Tsk, that old cynic...
Ulfr: But I'm sure that Flora wouldn't laugh at me like that.
