Traveler: A story?
Little Yi: Yep! Uncle Ghast's stories are so cool! They're kinda scary... And they're true!
Traveler: ...True?
Little Yi: Yep! Some of the stories actually happened in real life...
Little Yi: Like the one about Dusky Ming! I've even seen her before, and she said we should play again next time...
Little Yi: But I think ghosts probably don't have very good memory, because she's never come to play with me again since then.
Traveler: How spooky...
Little Yi: I know, right!? The story used to give me the creeps every time...
Little Yi: But after I saw Dusky Ming for myself, I wasn't scared anymore. Ghosts aren't that scary!
