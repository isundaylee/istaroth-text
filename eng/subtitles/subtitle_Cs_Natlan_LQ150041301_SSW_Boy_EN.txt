Hmph!
What do we do?
We can't open the Rift...
...Kill me!
Put an end...
To Huitztlan's
Shame...
By past fuel
And present flame
Life marches ever on
Burkina...?
I must atone...
Patience
We will answer to the fire
For all our deeds
Even if one day I fall behind
Never look back
Keep moving forward
As we are now
...Live with your guilt and shame
This is the price to pay
Heir to the Turnfire...
Please use my ruined vessel...
To train the heroes of the future
The will of Kongamato...
Will march ever on
Till the Abyss is stamped out
