Ying'er: Oh my, if it isn't my old acquaintance. Did you come all this way during Lantern Rite just to see me?
Ying'er: It's been a while, but you still look as lovely as ever.
Ying'er: Ah, it's the Lantern Rite, but I don't really have much time to spare. Can't help it when the shop's so popular, you know? Otherwise...
Ying'er: ...Hehe, anyway, why don't you feast your eyes on what we've got in store? Who knows, you might chance upon some extra benefits.
Ying'er: I mean, I'm just a slap of lipstick and a dab of makeup compared to those beauties.
