# Surrounded by the Aroma of Tea


## Talk 1

Paimon: Huh, this doesn't look like the drink they ordered. Just give this one to Paimon and try making another.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Sorry to keep you waiting!
Traveler: Enjoy.
Zhongli: Mmm, the tea is clear and glows with a pleasing hue. Its richness is complemented by a floral and fruity fragrance. Exquisite.
Paimon: Wow, so Zhongli is even super knowledgeable about tea.
Paimon: Paimon usually just gulps down the tea and says something simple like, "Yummy yummy in Paimon's tummy."
Zhongli: Mindfully savoring the tea shows due respect to the person that brewed it for you.
Zhongli: Tea of good quality is hard to come by, and those capable of brewing tea according to the occasion and emotions even more so.
Traveler: You're too kind.
Paimon: Oh, Paimon gets it now.
Paimon: So could you teach Paimon how to savor tea like you do? It seems you smell it first, then drink it, right?
Zhongli: That's correct.
Zhongli: Every type of tea is unique. The more you drink, the more you will understand the subtle differences. Smelling the aroma will reveal the quality of the tea.
Zhongli: Lower-grade teas emit a musty and seemingly scorched scent, whereas ones with a delicate yet soothing aroma are usually of a higher quality.
Zhongli: If you want to be more particular, according to Liyue ancient tradition, you could acquire a "Vintage Goblet," which is used specifically for examining the aroma.
Paimon: Oh no, all this time, Paimon's been missing out on her tea...
Zhongli: Not to worry. Knowledge is vast, it's never too late to learn.
Zhongli: As a beginner, you can try this method: first observe the color. Then, smell the fragrance... And finally, take a sip.
Zhongli: Remember, you can understand anything as long as you approach it in the proper order.
Traveler: I learned a lot today.
Zhongli: Qiaoying Village in northwest Liyue is famous for their tea industry. It would be well worthwhile the visit when you get the chance.
Zhongli: What I shared with you today are mostly my own habits as an old-fashioned Liyue local.
Zhongli: Each region has its own tea traditions and culture. One should always respect the conventions of the local region.
Paimon: Paimon gets it! But whether Paimon can remember it all is another story, hehe...
Traveler: Classic Paimon.
Zhongli: #Thank you for such excellent tea, Traveler. It made my trip out here all the more worthwhile.
Zhongli: If you ever come to manage a tea house, I will certainly be a regular.
Paimon: Well, we're already pretty busy. I don't think we'll have time to manage a side hustle at a tea house.
Traveler: Well, who knows...
Zhongli: Regardless, you have my complete support.
Zhongli: Let's call it a day. I won't take more of your time. All the best with your new pursuit.
Traveler: Bye.
Zhongli: Ah yes, the bill... Just put it on Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's tab, as usual.
Paimon: Of course... Take care! Give our regards to the director!
Traveler: Wait, about the bill...
Traveler: I'd like to know more.
Traveler: I'm flattered.
