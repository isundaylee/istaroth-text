# Vessie Chicken

A famous Fontainian cuisine. "Vessie" means "bladder" in Fontaine. As the name suggests, the seasoned chicken meat is enclosed in a forest boar's bladder when being poached in a meat broth. The bladder will puff out during the process like a rotund Specter. People usually only eat the chicken meat inside.
