# Diona Voicelines

## Hello
Diona, bartender of the Cat's Tail! I charge a hefty fee for private events. Huh? You didn't come here for a drink? Hmm... Then I accept your invitation... I suppose...

## Chat: Relax
Ahhh... that stretch feels good.

## Chat: Thinking
Hmm. Lizard Tail, Pepper, Starconch, hmm... what else do I need to create the most dreadfully disgusting cocktail?

## Chat: Waiting
I—I wasn't waiting for you. I just happened to be resting!

## When It Rains
Rain! I hate rain! ...Let's go inside... I—I'm not scared of water, I just... hate it when my clothes get wet.

## When Thunder Strikes
Ahh!!! Uhh, um... I'm not shaking, I'm not... Ohhhh...

## When It Snows: Playtime
Ooh, it's so cold to touch. Wow, it's so much fun!

## When It Snows: Viewing
Ooooh, look at the little white snowflakes dancing in the wind, to and fro, and... whew, isn't it... beautiful! C'mon, c'mon c'mon, sit with me... Watch...

## When the Sun Is Out
Come on, let's go bask in the sun a bit~ ...If you aren't coming, I'll just go by myself~ ...Last chance! Are you coming or not!?

## Good Morning
Morning~ Can you hand me that can of salted loach from the cabinet? Time to destroy the wine industry!

## Good Afternoon: Strange Noises
Wha— Ugh, no! You heard nothing!

## Good Afternoon: Canned Food
Uh, I was saving this can of fish for when I was really hungry. Stop looking at it like that! ...Mmm, okay, I'll let you have a little taste, but nothing more!

## Good Evening
Aw, I failed... Ugh, again... Everyone loved my drinks! Gah... Don't try to comfort me. I—I don't need comforting!

## Good Night
Without cat vision, will you be okay walking home in the dark? If you need me to escort you... What? Th—There's lights? Pff, well who said anything about escorting you? Go on now.

## About Diona
My ears and tail are no prop, they're real. Proof of my Kätzlein bloodline. It's only weird to you cause you've never seen it before. Wh—Why are you looking at me like that? Fine. You can touch my ears for a second, but the tail is off limits!

## About Us: Drinks
You want a non-alcoholic drink? No, that's not difficult, but it's meaningless! It doesn't have anything to do with my grand plan of destroying the wine industry of Mondstadt. I won't waste my time on such a drink, hmph!

## About Us: VIP Channels
Here! I call this Fantastic Summer-Serendipity Coral Sparkling Tea, I just made it one day when I was bored... Huh, you say it's popular? People are lining up to buy it? Don't be ridiculous.

## About Us: The Need to Chat
Well, if you ever feel lonely, you can chat with me. I know lots of cool things~ I'm a good... what's that called... chatting partner! Yeah! A good chatting partner, come chat with me... lots... ...okay?

## About Us: Curiosity
What's that!? What's that!? Let me see! Maybe I can add it to my next cocktail to give it a dreadful taste... Huh? It's just a strange-looking mushroom, how boring...

## About the Vision: Heirloom
How did I get my Vision? Simple — everyone in the Kätzlein lineage gets one. ...Huh? Then why doesn't Draff have a Vision? Uhh... Oh no, the cat's out of the bag! Eek!

## About the Vision: Origin
Why should I tell you!? Hmph! ...*sigh* Since you won't stop asking... and since we are friends, I'll tell you: One time, my daddy went missing on a hunt in a big storm. All I could think of was finding him, saving him... That's it, are you happy now?

## Something to Share
Hey, do you think there are any exotic plants on Dragonspine? Maybe something with a deadly bitterness, or something that numbs your mouth upon contact? I'm going to pick a lot! And then... hehehe-hee-hee...

## Interesting Things
When it comes to butterflies, I'm the best at pouncing on— err, catching them. Hey, not in a fun way! I catch butterflies to add a nasty taste to my cocktails. I'm not a cat! Meow! *hiss*

## About Diluc
Diluc... I can't stand him! If there was no Diluc, there would be no Mondstadt wine industry; if there was no Mondstadt wine industry, Daddy wouldn't drink; and if Daddy didn't drink... he would keep me company. Ohhhh...

## About Kaeya
How is it that even a captain is a disgusting boozehound! You know, that guy who's got that laugh! He downs drink after drink. Ugh!

## About Venti
Venti? I'm not familiar with him... He's a bard? Oh, he must be that guy who sings tunes to entertain the drunkards. Well, then I don't like him, no no no...

## About Barbara
How come all my fans are drunk middle-aged men, while Barbara's are all young people...? Hmph! So stupid. Forget it!

## About Jean
Acting Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius... A rare, mature adult who doesn't drink... But perhaps a little too earnest, cause is it just me, or are the Knights overdoing it a bit on protecting me?

## About Albedo
Alchemy genius? Hmm... I wonder if he knows of a way to finally help me make a drink that people don't like?

## About Lisa
Lisa is so nice and gentle! But... how can such a gentle person also be a regular drinker!? Ohhhh... Why!? ...There's really no hope for Mondstadt, is there?

## About Xiangling
Xiangling once gave me a "so-awful-it-goes-with-nothing" food combination she came up with, saying how it tasted absolutely terrible, blah blah blah... It didn't work, no use at all. All my little cat ears heard that night was "One more cup of that good stuff!" *sigh*

## About Klee
Every time Klee wants to play with me, I take her somewhere far from the tavern. Alcohol and explosives... yeah, that's a dangerous combination! I mean, do I want to destroy the wine industry of Mondstadt? Yes, but not in that sense!

## About Her Father
I adore my daddy more than anyone else! He's the greatest! But... Daddy after he drinks, ugh... Argh! I must bring an end to the wine industry of Mondstadt, and soon! No time for chit-chat!

## More About Diona: I
Life as a mixologist is very busy! When I'm not at the tavern, I'm out collecting ingredients for new recipes. So... So unless something is urgent, don't bother me.

## More About Diona: II
You wouldn't ask me to meow like a cat, like those boozehounds at the tavern do, would you? I wouldn't do it, no way! I'm not some little house pet that just shakes my ears real cute and stretches my back! I'm... I'm Diona, Destroyer of the Wine Industry!

## More About Diona: III
"How did the Destroyer of the Wine Industry become the Cat's Tail's mascot...?" Y—You're asking this just to make fun of me! Ohhh, you're awful! I won't be giving YOU any more drinks, not even water.

## More About Diona: IV
Don't, don't make me angry. I'm pretty tolerant, but don't even try to mess with me. I'm warning you, I bite when I get angry! Meow!!! ...But maybe I'd let you off easy, no bites...

## More About Diona: V
You and me... we're good friends now, right? I kind of remember having a friend like this before, but maybe it was a dream... Here, give me your hand. Ahh... Hmm, nice and warm... Very nice... please don't leave me, and become another dream.

## Diona's Hobbies
I enjoy hunting. I'm especially good at tracking down prey! But Daddy says that the wild is dangerous. One should only go deep into the forest with a reliable adult. ...You're a reliable adult, right?

## Diona's Troubles
How, oh how can I make awful-tasting drinks...? I had high hopes for the soy sauce, milk, Jueyun Chili, and Dandelion Seed cocktail — my most nightmarish combination to date! But even that was met with praise at the tavern. "This is Little Diona's best drink yet..." Grr! But I won't give up...

## Favorite Food
I like, no, LOVE to eat fish! The fish Daddy cooks is the best, a purrfect main course! ...But eating fish as drunk food, that's absolute blasphemy!

## Least Favorite Food
Carrots, potatoes, onions, tomatoes... I don't like the taste of any of those vegetables. ...In fact, I don't eat vegetables at all!

## Receiving a Gift: I
Mmm! I just wanna ask you this... Will you bring more of it next time?

## Receiving a Gift: II
I'll admit, that was pretty sweet... but that doesn't mean I haven't had sweeter.

## Receiving a Gift: III
Hey... What do you take me for, some sort of stray cat!?

## Birthday
Here you go — fried fish with my special sauce! ...Relax, I didn't add anything strange! My cooking is actually really good when I want it to be — stop talking and try it already! Hmph... that's better... Oh, and uh, happy birthday.
