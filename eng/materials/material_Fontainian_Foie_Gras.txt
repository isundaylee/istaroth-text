# Fontainian Foie Gras

A traditional dish of Fontaine. The foie gras only needs to be pan-fried before being served. Thanks to the masterful temperature control, the golden-brown foie gras tastes enticingly tender. The process takes focus and concentration, or else the delicious liver might be liquefied into an oily mess.
