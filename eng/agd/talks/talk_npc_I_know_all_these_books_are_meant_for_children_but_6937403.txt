Chevreuse: I know all these books are meant for children, but some of the stories are actually quite good.
Chevreuse: Here, for example. This one's the story of two parrots that sue each other. Each accuses the other of stealing a poem that they both claim to have written that morning.
Chevreuse: But since they only know how to imitate speech, the judge has no way of knowing who actually wrote the poem first... Such a fun story. Any chance I can borrow it?
