Souka: #So, how did you get on, Traveler? The script has a lot of background info, so you must have come up with quite a few ideas for the plot, yes?
Traveler: Of course!
Souka: That's great! Once you've sorted your ideas, please write down the key points. I'll come back and refer to them when I get onto embellishing the story later on!
Souka: Given how well we understand one another, you don't need to go into too much detail â€” I'm sure I'll get the gist!
Traveler: Before we do that, can we talk about the planning?
Souka: Oh? Seems like my script has brought out your inner creator!
Souka: As I mentioned, my plan is to use pictures and a broadcasting device to turn my new work into a lively, three-dimensional reading experience...
Souka: But as for how I'll do that... I'm still brushing up on my knowledge, and trying to make the plan as logical and pragmatic as possible.
Souka: After all, your imagination is quite immense! Most readers are far less imaginative, so I need to give them more details to work with...
Souka: However, our number one priority is to find a way to reduce the costs. If this novel costs the same as 50 regular ones, sales are going to suffer, and it'll all have been for nothing.
Souka: Pictures should be easy to get our hands on, just like illustrations were. The broadcasting device, however, is another matter. If we use imported Fontainian technology, each book will end up with a six-figure price tag...
Souka: Argh, I'll have to give it some more thought...
Traveler: Any news about Haniyyah?
Souka: Oh yes, of course! You must be curious how our Fungi friends have been holding up too, right?
Souka: Rest assured, the fact that I can even be here shows that both they and the tournament preparations are all doing just fine!
Souka: Haniyyah has already finished planning said tournament, while sponsors have been secured. We just need to sort out all the staff and materials. Then, we can gradually get the ball rolling with all the pre-tournament promotions...
Souka: But most importantly, the timing of the event will be key. We'd rather delay it than let the tournament's reputation slide, and we want to avoid letting our audience and contestants down at all costs.
Souka: We might have to wait half a year, or even a whole year, before the right moment comes along. Anyway, we'll take it step by step!
Souka: In the meantime, Haniyyah's finished with all her business affairs for now, so when you get a chance, come pay us and our Fungi friends a visit at the campsite!
Traveler: I'll give it some thought.
Souka: No problem, we've got plenty of time! And no matter how many ideas you jot down, I'll remember all of them!
