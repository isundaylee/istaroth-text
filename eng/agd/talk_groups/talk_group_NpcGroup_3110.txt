Traveler: Wanna play?
Riku: Okay! Let's play Hide-and-Seek!
Riku: ...Ah, but my sister is still working at the shrine, and I promised her that I wouldn't run around. I need to wait for her so we can go home together...
Riku: If my sister can't find me, she'll probably worry...
Riku: Thank you, but I think I'll just play by myself.

Traveler: What are you doing?
Riku: I'm counting the people coming to the shrine for fortune slips!
Riku: There was a very short girl in a tanuki outfit drawing a slip, wishing to grow taller or something...
Riku: There was also a beautiful older girl who wished that Inazuma will remain peaceful and stuff...
Riku: Oh, and there was some big bro wishing for the Kujou Clan to be prosperous...
Riku: Their wishes are so special. My wish is just to be able to play Hide-and-Seek with my sister...
