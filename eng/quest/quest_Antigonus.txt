# Antigonus


## Talk 1

Antei: You two are...
Paimon: Are you Antei?
Antei: That's right. That's me. I feel... a little strange...
Antei: I remember chasing those scoundrels... ripping a core out and throwing it into a camp. Then after that, I got a little woozy from my own injuries... I was hurt pretty bad...
Antei: But then I woke up, and then I met you, and now I feel fine. Tell me, am I going to die soon or something?
Traveler: ...
Antei: ...No, that's not important right now. Are you here to arrest me again? I've already proven my innocence.
Antei: It was those people from Khaenri'ah. They were the ones who stole that library book. I was assigned as one of their bodyguards, sure, but there's no way I would have been in cahoots with them!
Antei: I tracked their diplomatic team to this place and beat them all.
Antei: But I spent a long time dealing with some giant mechanical creature they had with them. Finally, I was able to tear its core out, but I was wounded seriously in the process.
Antei: The disabled machine crashed on top of the lost book. There's no way to retrieve it now.
Paimon: Wow, Byakuyakoku's Jibashiri are pretty tough...
Antei: Wait, you aren't Jibashiri or candidates yourselves? *sigh* Whatever. The Jibashiri started out as heroes who fought against the Bathysmal Vishaps. It was only later that they became law enforcement — the judges of the nether.
Antei: The machine's core is in the camp. Go there and have a look if you don't believe me.

## Talk 2

Antei: I once heard a Narukami Island envoy talk about this creature named a "bird." It has wings and it can fly through the skies.
Antei: That's just amazing, can you imagine it?
Antei: Some people believe that they are messengers from the gods who carry word of human fates.
Antei: And if some exiled person finally expires out in the wild, the very same creature will come to peck and consume their mortal flesh.
Antei: These animals fascinate me, to be honest. If I should see the light of another day, I will definitely keep a bird.

## Talk 3

Antei: Did you get the book?
Paimon: We did. You're indeed innocent, Antei.
Antei: From how you spoke earlier, you aren't Jibashiri... Which is a shame. You could've declared me innocent on the spot otherwise.
Antei: That would have saved me some time.
Antei: Again, I feel really energized, but I'm quite sure that I was exhausted from losing too much blood just a while ago. I just can't shake the feeling that I'm going to die shortly...
Paimon: Uh...
Antei: *sigh* Let me ask you a question, stranger. Does a man sin who has been wrongly convicted by Byakuyakoku?
Traveler: ...
Antei: If I, due to my disturbed state of mind, was left here by Tokoyo Ookami as a Sinshade. Is this transgression?
Antei: Am I guilty?
Traveler: No, you aren't.
Paimon: #Be careful {NICKNAME}. If he realizes that... you know, then he's gonna disappear.
Traveler: You're just an afterimage that Antei left behind.
Antei: ...
Traveler: You are innocent, and I will make sure the world knows that.
Antei: Haha. So that's it? So, I'm just a shadow, left behind after my death.
Antei: And... I am innocent.
Antei: Antei's afterimage starts to recite some broken passages—
"What divine law have I broken... Why do the unfortunate rely on the gods?
Do my deeds have meaning, now that my earnest deeds have earned me a sinful name?"
