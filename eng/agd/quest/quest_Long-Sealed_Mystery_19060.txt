(Quest is part of chapter: Hangout Event: Shikanoin Heizou - Act I Trap 'Em by Storm)

# Long-Sealed Mystery


## Talk 1

Sango: Traveler, I believe you can find out the truth. That Shikanoin is hiding something, I just know it.
Ryuuji: *sigh*... Sango and Detective Heizou are both great people, but when they're together, only arguing ensues.
Sango: Oh suck it up, Ryuuji.

## Talk 2

Uesugi: Hey, Traveler. Investigating a case isn't so easy, is it? Don't worry, I'll tell you all you need to know.
Traveler: About President Sango...
Uesugi: Hah, Sango? The Takatsukasa Clan really hired an amazing detective, didn't they?
Uesugi: She comes to the station to submit applications every now and then, and has been constantly requesting to reinvestigate the Ryuuji Case. But Heizou has always prevented her from doing so. I really didn't expect that she'd go as far as writing a complaint letter, though. Whew, she's relentless.
Uesugi: As for why Heizou senpai has been keeping her away from the case, I think he's afraid that Sango would be putting herself in danger. After all, we're talking about the murder of an important man, that can be deep water if you're not careful...
Uesugi: Sango may run a detective agency, but in the end, she's just an ordinary person.
Traveler: So are they friends?
Uesugi: Uh well... not exactly. I've pretty much seen them argue every time they meet. But, Heizou might still consider her as an old friend. I heard that he used to work with Sango.
Uesugi: Sometimes he'd ask me to hand over less pressing cases to the detective agency. I guess he just wants to support Sango's business.
Uesugi: Hehe, Heizou senpai is a good person, there's no doubt about that.

## Talk 3

Owada: Don't take anything Uesugi says too seriously. Just nod along...
Traveler: About Takatsukasa Isamu and Ryuuji...
Owada: Oh, that? Well, let me see...
Owada: Ryuuji saw Takatsukasa Isamu as his foster father, that's for sure. But I can't say whether Isamu helped Ryuuji without expecting anything in return.
Owada: After all, Isamu was a resourceful person. A simple and naive person like Ryuuji wouldn't ever be suitable as an adviser, but he could certainly be a loyal and trustworthy aid.
Owada: Isamu was expecting a child of his own later, but unfortunately he was killed before the child was ever born...
Owada: Anyway, enough about all that... Aren't you here to investigate the case? You'd better get a move on.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Yikes... he ate all kinds of stuff!

## Talk 5

Paimon (Conviction of Ryuuji): The suspect, Ryuuji, 20 years old, Doushin, a subordinate of the deceased, Takatsukasa Isamu.
Paimon (Conviction of Ryuuji): Ryuuji grew to resent his boss, Takatsukasa Isamu, following conflict at work. He then secretly bought a bottle of poison to kill him in revenge.
Paimon (Conviction of Ryuuji): Unused poison was later found in the suspect Ryuuji's house. For the crime of premeditated murder, Ryuuji is ordered to remain in temporary incarceration awaiting trial. This file shall be kept as evidence.
Paimon (Conviction of Ryuuji): Signed: Kujou Sara
Paimon: Wow, Ryuuji's conviction really was signed by Kujou Sara... But now we know she had it wrong.

## Talk 6

Paimon (Conviction of Shiroyama): The suspect, Shiroyama, 22 years old, forensic doctor, a subordinate of the deceased, Takatsukasa Isamu.
Paimon (Conviction of Shiroyama): Shiroyama grew to resent his boss, Takatsukasa Isamu, following conflict at work. He then secretly bought a bottle of poison to kill him in revenge.
Paimon (Conviction of Shiroyama): Unused poison was later found in the suspect Shiroyama's office. In his testament, he confessed to having planted the poison found in Ryuuji's house.
Paimon (Conviction of Shiroyama): For the crime of premeditated murder, Shiroyama is hereby sentenced to death. Punishment cannot be carried out as the suspect ended his own life before the execution could take place. This file shall be kept as evidence.
Paimon (Conviction of Shiroyama): Signed: Kujou Sara
Paimon: Huh? So Shiroyama's conviction was also signed by Kujou Sara... just like Ryuuji's!

## Talk 7

Paimon (Toxicology Report): On the toxin that caused Takatsukasa Isamu's death:
Paimon (Toxicology Report): An odorless, tasteless, and inert substance. Soluble in water, but insoluble in other substances. Has the properties of a synthetic toxin. It appears as a fine, white, powdery substance in its normal state. Tentative name: "white powder."
Paimon (Toxicology Report): The station has investigated the ledgers of all domestic commerce guilds, no transaction record for such an item was found.
Paimon: Hmm, a synthetic toxin? What's that?

## Talk 8

Paimon (Ryuuji's Testimony): "A week before the incident, Master Takatsukasa Isamu caught a cold and lost his appetite. Rice was all he could eat and he had been taking some special cold medicine."
Paimon (Ryuuji's Testimony): "The night before the incident, he had yet to recover and was still busy with his work, so I was worried about his health. When Dr. Shiroyama came to deliver the medicine, I consulted him about a health supplement."
Paimon (Ryuuji's Testimony): "Dr. Shiroyama said fish-liver paste could help boost his immune system, so I went to the forensic office to retrieve some and gave it to Master Takatsukasa..."
Paimon (Ryuuji's Testimony): "But by the next day... Really, Master Takatsukasa was so kind to me, I swear I wouldn't ever do that to him!"
Paimon: Hmm, come to think of it, Shiroyama was a forensic doctor... He could easily pull off something like this.
