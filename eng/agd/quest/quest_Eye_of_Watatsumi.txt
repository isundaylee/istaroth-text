# "Eye of Watatsumi"


## Talk 1

Ancient Stone Tablet: "...They say that Omikami's envoy had three eyes: one for the 'soul,' one a 'mirror,' and the last the 'truth'..."
Ancient Stone Tablet: "...From the depths it arose, from the *south*, o'er the *north*, and all about the *western* mound..."
Ancient Stone Tablet: "...The three eyes shone mercilessly to ward off the dragon's heir..."
Paimon: Paimon... knows all these words... but none of them mean anything when strung together.
Paimon: It doesn't look like there are any clues around here either, so why don't we try using *Elemental Sight*?
