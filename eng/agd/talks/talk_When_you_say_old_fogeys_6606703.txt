Traveler: When you say "old fogeys"...
Anchieta: Ah, heard that, did you? Sorry about that. I was just talking about some old friends from the Masters of the Night-Wind.
Anchieta: I'm often invited to perform and sing at some of their tribe's events when music or song accompaniment is required...
Anchieta: ...But those louts never show up to watch, even when I make the long, long trip over to where they are.
Anchieta: *sigh* Forget it. Those old geezers are just like that.
Anchieta: Unless I write them a letter myself, there's no getting them to move â€” and I ain't doing that!
