# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Tell us about your relationship to this castle...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): You've guessed it already, I reckon. In the past, when I could still change my form freely, he... and I, and many of our companions dwelled here.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): In those days, a new nation had just been born, and as far as we were concerned, the possibilities were yet endless.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Here, we organized the classics, researching music theory and magic, in the hopes that we might tame this perilous power and use it to open up a brighter age.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): But... These possibilities would quickly become lost to us, and I alone remained...
Traveler: Osse...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): It's fine. These things happened a long time ago.
