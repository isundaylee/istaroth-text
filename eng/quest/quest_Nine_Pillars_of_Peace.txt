# Nine Pillars of Peace


## Talk 1

Inscription: "All the turmoils in the world have their root in human vice..."
Inscription: "Nine pillars we raise here to suppress conflict, that we may never again raise armies against each other..."

## Talk 2

Traveler: We have a deal.
Linlang: Well, here's the money, then. I'll take the ring in exchange.
Linlang: If you ever pick up any other antiques that you'd like to sell, feel free to come to me.

## Talk 3

Traveler: Could you help us look at this antique?
Linlang: An antique? Well, you've come to the right person. I'd say that I'm the fairest at valuating such things in all of Liyue. Let's see it.
Linlang: Hmm, both the gemstone and the band are of fine quality, and it is very ancient... Yet it is very well-preserved — highly unusual.
Linlang: Still, I can't say I've ever heard the phrase "Disaster runs rampant throughout the world , and all who live do so in agony."
Linlang: Never mind that. Where did you find this ring?
Traveler: In a ruin near Cuijue Slope.
Linlang: You... You're a fair hand at this, aren't you? Not many dare to go there to hunt for treasure.
Linlang: Were those ruins surrounded by nine pillars, with a stone tablet in the center, by any chance?
Linlang: Don't look so surprised. I've heard many people who come to do business with me mention that place. They always say that such a large formation must have some sort of treasure within.
Linlang: They even say that those pillars and that ruin were built by Liyue's forebears in order to quell conflict...
Linlang: But I suppose that's just a legend. After all, if nine stone pillars could quell strife, this world would have been at peace long ago.
Linlang: But regardless of whether this legend is true or not, this ring was found in that ruin, and has to be related to that legend.
Linlang: It's got a name, a history to go with it, and it's of good quality, too. It'll fetch a fine price.
Linlang: ...Relax, I'm not going to ask how you got in there. I just do business. Other matters are none of my concern.
Linlang: All in all, I'd say this ring's worth <color=#00E1FFFF>200,000 Mora</color>. What do you say?

## Talk 4

Traveler: Regarding that ring...
Linlang: Oh, you've considered the matter? Will you sell or not, then?

## Talk 5

Traveler: Regarding that ring...
Bolai: Have you considered it? Well then, are you willing to sell it to me?

## Talk 6

Traveler: Let me give it a little thought...
Bolai: You... Well, alright. Give it some thought. Perhaps my offer isn't the best you've heard.
Bolai: But when it comes to business, I'll do right by you should you sell it to me.
Bolai: Think about it. This ring won't stop changing hands with me. If you sell it to me now, don't you think I'll let you in on any further transactions that take place down the line?
Bolai: Moreover, I'm willing to add some things on, to boot...
Bolai: Think on it carefully, and come back to me anytime should you decide to sell!

## Talk 7

Traveler: Sold.
Bolai: Wonderful! Very decisive. Here's the money. It's yours.
Bolai: Ah, this ring is a true treasure...
Bolai: There must be other such gems within those ruins...

## Talk 8

Traveler: Could you help us look at this antique?
Bolai: Antiques and curios? I'm not too familiar with them, but I'll have a look.
Bolai: This ring... Huh, it's set with a jade gem, and one of good quality, too. Just the gem alone would be worth a sum.
Bolai: There's an inscription on it, too... "Disaster runs rampant throughout the world , and all who live do so in agony..." Where did you find this ring?
Traveler: In a ruin near Cuijue Slope.
Bolai: Cuijue Slope, huh... Tsk tsk, what a shame. Jueyun Karst is so nearby, too...
Bolai: If this ring came from a ruin in Jueyun Karst, it would surely fetch a great price.
Bolai: Unfortunately, without any storied origin, this one's price falls a great deal. But it's of good quality. I'm sure someone would want it nonetheless.
Bolai: How about this? I'll offer you <color=#00E1FFFF>180,000 Mora</color> for this ring, with a few add-ons to boot. Would you sell it to me?

## Talk 9

Paimon: This ruin gives Paimon the creeps. But this should be the end of it...
Paimon: And we got some treasure for our efforts, too — we even got ourselves that ring!
Paimon: Let's go find someone who has an <color=#00E1FFFF>eye for antiques</color> and see how much it'll sell for.

## Talk 10

Traveler: What add-ons?
Bolai: What, you ask... Well, it'll be good, that's for sure. I won't do wrong by you.

## Talk 11

Traveler: I need to give it some thought.
Linlang: My prices are likely to be the fairest. If you have any problem with it, you can go and check with other people.
