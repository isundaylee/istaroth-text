# Qiqi Voicelines

## Hello
I am Qiqi. I am a zombie. And I... forgot what comes next.

## Chat: Talking to Herself
Hey, do you know what? Uhh... neither do I. I... already forgot.

## Chat: Afraid of Heat
Let's go somewhere cooler.

## Chat: Training
One, two, three, four. Two, two, three, four...

## When It Rains
I forgot my umbrella again.

## When It Snows
I want to build a snowman. Will you help?

## When the Sun Is Out
I should have stayed indoors today.

## When It's Windy
The wind is... frigid. I like it.

## When the Wind Is Blowing
Hold my hand please. This wind could blow me away.

## Good Morning
Morning means it's time to check my diary. Because my diary reminds me what I'm supposed to do in the morning.

## Good Afternoon
I just remembered something. I forgot to help Dr. Baizhu prepare medications.

## Good Evening
Good evening. How was your day? My day was... fine, I think. But I can't remember.

## Good Night
It's time for you to sleep now. I will do my stretches. ...Do not watch me, please.

## About Qiqi
Did you ask me something? Sorry... I forgot.

## About Us: Memory
I have a poor memory for most things. But as far as I know, that doesn't matter.

## About Us: Memory Training
I started memory training exercises recently. So don't worry, I won't forget who you are.

## About the Vision
My Vision can't turn back time. But at least it gives me the power to protect the people that matter most.

## Something to Share
I may be a corpse, but I am in a much better physical condition than Dr. Baizhu.

## Interesting Things
Sometimes I see finches near the pharmacy. A nice little group of finches.

## About Baizhu
I can never remember Dr. Baizhu's face. But I don't mind.

## About Hu Tao
Warm. Fake smile. Death. I despise Hu Tao.

## About Xiao: Name
Sounds like a historical artifact to me.

## About Xiao: Memory
Remind me, have I met him before?

## About Xinyan
...Who?

## About Yaoyao
Cute. Like a nice little finch.

## About Dusky Ming
On some nights, I almost feel like someone is doing stretches together with me. But maybe I just have an overactive imagination.

## More About Qiqi: I
What's going on?

## More About Qiqi: II
I perform stretches regularly to help me maintain the same range of movement as a normal human being. But as soon as I stop doing them, the rigor mortis starts to set in again.

## More About Qiqi: III
Some people want to take advantage of me. Others are terrified of me. But you... You are not like any of those people.

## More About Qiqi: IV
Since we first met, I have had a warm feeling inside. Not the kind of warmth that makes me feel rotten. The other kind of warm. The one that happens inside my heart. Thank you. I am happy. Sadly I only recognize the current you. If I forget you... No. I will order myself to remember you.

## More About Qiqi: V
In the past, my only thought was: I must stay alive. Even though I didn't know what to live for. But now, I think I know. I want to live with you. I want to ask, can we always stay together, for the rest of life, until death? Yes or no? Yes? Is that your real answer? Good, excellent. I promise to always protect you.

## Qiqi's Hobbies
I want to have a pet. For example, a nice little finch.

## Qiqi's Troubles
I don't know why, but high temperatures make me feel... disgusting.

## Favorite Food
I like coconut milk... But, I don't know what it tastes like.

## Least Favorite Food
Sorry, I have no idea.

## Receiving a Gift: I
Cold. I like it. But, no flavor...

## Receiving a Gift: II
Huh...

## Receiving a Gift: III
It's burning my tongue...

## Birthday
Many happy returns. Here is a bag of herbal medicine for you. You must be very surprised that I remembered? Let me explain. Last time you told me, I wrote your birthday down on a piece of paper. If I look at something once a day, it eventually goes into my long-term memory, and it will stay there forever.

## Feelings About Ascension: Intro
Now, I have more power. But... what does that mean? Please explain. Thank you.

## Feelings About Ascension: Building Up
Ah, I understand. When I get stronger, I need to put more effort into controlling my strength.

## Feelings About Ascension: Climax
In the past, I did not understand the idea of being stronger than I already was. Now that I understand it well, I wish I was just a little stronger still.

## Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion
All of this is because of you. Thank you very much. Can you make me a promise? From now on, please, let me protect you. Do you accept? Yes or no?
