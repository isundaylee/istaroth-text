Joliot: Oh Archons, please grant us a healthy and wise child!
Irimia: Erm... Can you still say that? The Hydro Archon seems to have left...
Joliot: That doesn't matter. I'm referring to all Archons!
Joliot: And the Hydro Archon only lost her powers to help Fontaine. So the Archons do look after us, don't they?
Irimia: That is true. But I wouldn't make such big requests.
Irimia: Well, I wouldn't ask for my child to be clever or talented. Just for them to have a peaceful life!
