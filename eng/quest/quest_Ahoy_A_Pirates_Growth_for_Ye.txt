# Ahoy! A Pirate's Growth for Ye!


## Talk 1

Little Meng: *sigh* Can I really do this?
Traveler: What's wrong, Little Meng?
Little Meng: Oh, it's you, Traveler. How do you do?
Paimon: You look kinda upset, Little Meng.
Paimon: What's the matter? Did the other kids stop playing that, uh, pirate game with you?
Little Meng: Eh? No, no. Little Lulu and Little Fei have just gone home, that's all.
Little Meng: I... wanted to have a little walk by myself, so I haven't gone back yet.
Paimon: Won't your parents be worried?
Little Meng: They should still be at work.
Little Meng: But let's not talk about that right now. Can I ask you a question?
Traveler: And what might that question be?
Little Meng: So... I've heard lots of people tell stories about you.
Little Meng: You've been to so many places and you've seen so much, so perhaps you can give me an answer...
Paimon: Ooh, you're getting all serious now. What's the question?
Little Meng: I'd like to ask...
Little Meng: How does someone "mature"?
Traveler: Maturity takes time.
Little Meng: So you're saying that people will mature naturally as they grow older?
Little Meng: But wouldn't we mature too late, then?
Paimon: Well, if you want to take a trip out of the city, we can accompany you!
Little Meng: That's... I wouldn't want to bother you. And I doubt that something special would fall into my lap just because I went outside the city...
Little Meng: Instead, I'd like you to help me with something else.
Little Meng: I've heard people say that if you have problems that you can't solve, you can write them down into a drifting bottle and let those troubles float down the river...
Little Meng: That way, they might actually be resolved.
Little Meng: But I've also heard that there are lots of monsters outside. I don't think it would be safe to go alone.
Little Meng: So, could you protect me while I do that?
Traveler: Sure.
Little Meng: Thanks a lot! Don't worry, I've got savings. I can pay you!
Little Meng: Let's go, then. First, let's go down to the Bishui River.
Traveler: I'm on the case.
Traveler: You need to have some special experiences.
Little Meng: Special experiences, huh... But I've never left Liyue Harbor in my life.
Traveler: I'm afraid I don't have time to play at the moment...
Little Meng: Hahaha, I only play that game with Little Lulu and Little Fei. Since they're not around, the game is off for sure.

## Talk 2

Little Meng: Are we there yet? Hmm... We've got to pick a good spot to send our bottle off.
Little Meng: We should find an upstream position if we want it to go out further...

## Talk 3

Little Meng: What the... To think that these things existed... That was scary!
Little Meng: Thank you so much! C'mon, let's continue.
Little Meng: ...Wait. Where's my drifting bottle? I was just holding onto it, but now it's gone!
Little Meng: Did I drop it while we were fighting that... that Whopperflower?
Little Meng: Please, help me find it!

## Talk 4

Little Meng: Phew... I was up all night writing that message. If we'd lost the bottle, I'd have to write it all over again...
Paimon: Wow, an all-nighter? You sure have a lot of worries, huh?
Little Meng: Well... not really? I just really want to know how I can become mature.
Little Meng: I've looked at lots of sources and read a ton of books, but the more I read, the less I understand...
Little Meng: Hehe, and that's why I wrote all the questions I don't understand into that message, in hopes that I'd get an answer.
Little Meng: C'mon! Let's send our bottle off!

## Talk 5

Little Meng: This looks like a good spot. Let's put the bottle in the water here.
Little Meng: I hope I'll get my answers...
Traveler: You will.
Little Meng: Thanks! Alright then, let's head back into the city.
Paimon: Still, will Little Meng's questions really be resolved with a little bottle floating down the river?
Traveler: Perhaps this is just his way of comforting himself.
Paimon: Really? Paimon feels like there's a lot he's not telling us...
Paimon: But come to think of it, this whole maturity thing is pretty tricky, huh?

## Talk 6

Little Meng: Thanks so much for today.
Little Meng: This is for you. Please take it.
Little Meng: Oh, right. Could you keep what happened today a secret from Little Lulu and Little Fei?
Little Meng: This is a personal issue of mine. I don't want to drag their spirits down.
Little Meng: Okay then, I'm going home now. See you!

## Talk 7

Little Meng: Where's that bottle gone off to...

## Talk 8

Little Meng: Hey there, Traveler! Have you found the drifting bottle yet?

Check: Little Meng's drifting bottle didn't get very far. Perhaps it was filled with too many frustrations...
