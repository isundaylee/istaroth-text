Traveler: Who are you?
Siyu: Call me Siyu. I grew up by the sea, but I'll never tire of the fresh fish here in the harbor.
Siyu: I got married just two years ago, and thanks to the prophetic guidance of the Lord of Geo, my husband's business has gone smoothly this whole time.
Siyu: So we have money to spare now. But still, as the woman of the house, I should learn to be frugal out of principle.

Siyu: What are you doing?
Siyu: Oh, I'm just getting ready to buy some fish.
Siyu: After visiting Uncle Gao's stand, I can't help but feel that Uncle Sun's fish are not only cheaper, but more fresh too!
Siyu: I think it's the perfect chance to buy a load of fish to make for my husband. I'm just worried I wouldn't be able to move such a load. If only "The Wrench" were here...
Siyu: "The Wrench"...?
Siyu: Yes, haven't you heard of Wrench Wang down in the shipyard? He's known for his great strength. Why, he'd help haul this load and carry me back home on his shoulder.
Siyu: He's been good to me as long as I can remember. He would always share any tasty food he had, and he even taught me arithmetic. He's like a brother to me!
Siyu: But he doesn't seem very fond of my husband for some odd reason. He's always staring at him.
Siyu: *sigh* If only there were some way to help them get along...
