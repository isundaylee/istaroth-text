Traveler: Are you lost?
Bagayogo: Yes, I wa... I mean no I wasn't! I'm not lost!
Bagayogo: *sigh* I'm sorry, I'm just so anxious that I'm not even making sense anymore.
Bagayogo: I'm not lost, but I do seem to have accidentally lost my daughter, Arcantel.
Bagayogo: ...For all I know, this is no accident, and just her running around as always, that little rascal...
Bagayogo: If you run into a little girl spouting a stream of absolute nonsense about art, she's probably the one!
Bagayogo: *sigh* She just enjoys chatting with people by the roadside. I'm sure she'll come back once she's said her piece...
