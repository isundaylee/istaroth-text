The Steambird: "Paradoxically Good and Evil? The Past and Present of Mr. Sawleg."
The Steambird: Recently, Mr. Sawleg turned himself in to the Maison Gardiennage, along with a criminal who had impersonated him and copied his criminal acts. The copycat was caught by him due to leaving malicious comments below advertisements.
The Steambird: During the trial, he confessed to using a woodsaw to cut off his own prosthetic leg in public, impersonating a staff member from the Fontaine Research Institute sent to pick up a visiting scholar, impersonating a member of the Maison Gardiennage, and other crimes.
The Steambird: Upon hearing he was to be sent to the Fortress of Meropide to serve his sentence, Mr. Sawleg let out a tremendous laugh and began to celebrate and clap on the spot!
The Steambird: When reporters asked him why, he replied excitedly: "The people inside the Fortress of Meropide have never even heard of my performance art. And I simply cannot allow something like that to exist."
The Steambird: In addition, the copycat criminal was also sentenced to imprisonment in the Fortress of Meropide for assisting unfair business practices.
