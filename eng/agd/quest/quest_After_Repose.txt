# After Repose


## Talk 1

Paimon: Time to set off! Let's head to the southeast of Gandharva Ville and meet up with the others.

## Talk 2

Tighnari: Cyrus has been living in the city lately. He rented a place near the field so he can keep an eye on his tomato plants.
Paimon: Then let's go look for him there!

## Talk 3

Kaveh: ...Huh? Where'd the wine cups go? I could have sworn I left them here after I washed them...
Kaveh: ...Ah, there they are.
Alhaitham: I'll have a cup, too.
Kaveh: Can you see if the cookies are still on the table?
Alhaitham: They are, and so are the fruits.
Kaveh: Hmm... Ugh, this is so bland... I should have gotten a few bottles of what Cyno's group was drinking last night.
Alhaitham: Do tell. What were they drinking?
Kaveh: #Oh right, I forgot to mention. So, I ran into Cyrus yesterday evening when I went to the tavern to pick up some things. He was hosting a dinner for Cyno, Tighnari, Collei, and Traveler and Paimon.
Kaveh: Anyway, they got a bottle of Lambad's new vintage for the table. At least, I think that's what it was. It looked pretty good.
Alhaitham: Sounds like they're all tangled up in this.
Kaveh: You know what it's about, right? Sixteen-year-old kid, tried to extort Cyrus? He was asking for ten million Mora.
Alhaitham: I heard some people talking about it on the streets, yes. Didn't take them long to catch the culprit. The sages are probably dealing with the case by now.
Kaveh: *sigh* I wonder what Sir Naphis and the others will make of it.
Kaveh: Oh, Cyrus showed me the extortion letter, too. It was crudely written, but the paper had this beautiful pattern on it that I've never seen before. Really caught my eye.
Kaveh: Gimme a sec, I'll sketch it out for you.
Kaveh: ...Okay, done. Take a look.
Kaveh: You see what I mean? I don't think I've ever seen writing paper like this around before. God knows where the culprit got it from.
Alhaitham: Interesting. These are all motifs associated with the tribes of the desert.
Kaveh: What? Really?
Alhaitham: Take this, for instance. Looks like an outline of a spire, similar to the kind found on some ancient palaces. And the crisscrossing and mirroring here, I recognize that too.
Alhaitham: It bears a striking resemblance to an ancient emblem. One that hasn't been used in a very long time.
Kaveh: Whose emblem is it?
Alhaitham: It's the emblem of the Temple of Silence.

## Talk 4

Kaveh: After discussing it with each other, we both agreed that something didn't feel right. So we went looking for you.
Kaveh: This was a long way to come from the city... Alhaitham figured that you were probably with Tighnari, so Gandharva Ville was our first stop. But the Forest Watchers told us that you'd gone camping.
Kaveh: Then, just as we were heading off to the camp site, we ran into Cyno. He said he was on a supply run. We exchanged a few words, and then he ran off!
Paimon: Hold on, so what's the deal with that emblem you were talking about? The Temple of Silence, you said? What is that? Should we be worried?
Tighnari: Something's up, huh? Give me a second, let me get Collei.
Alhaitham: So you've never heard of the Temple of Silence? Well, to put it simply, it's an organization that has existed in Sumeru for over a thousand years.
Alhaitham: These days, you can find a Temple of Silence office in the Akademiya. Theoretically, it's responsible for the custody and disposal of information and documents not fit for public dissemination.
Alhaitham: At least, that's what they tell the outside world. In truth, it's essentially a vestigial institution nowadays. There's an office with their name on it, but it's functionally obsolete.
Alhaitham: Historically speaking, the original Temple of Silence is said to have been established by Hermanubis, one of the Seven Pillars of King Deshret and the greatest of all sages. Most of the organization's members hailed from the desert.
Alhaitham: By contrast, none of the Akademiya Temple's current members are from the desert region. Nor do they use any symbols connected with the desert folk.
Collei: So the Temple of Silence at the Akademiya is just a fake? Wow...
Alhaitham: It's possible. The real question is why. My guess is, they're covering something up.
Paimon: So how do you know all this? Sounds like some pretty top-secret stuff.
Kaveh: Did you forget? He did a stint as Acting Grand Sage. And kept the pay raise even after he resigned.
Paimon: Oh yeah, Paimon did totally forget about that... So you took the chance to read all the top-secret documents while you were Acting Grand Sage, huh?
Alhaitham: If you're asking me whether I familiarized myself with the documentation in my office, I would respond that that's a perfectly normal part of any job.
Kaveh: So much about this doesn't make sense. Why did the emblem of the Temple of Silence appear on a threat letter from an Akademiya student to Cyrus?
Kaveh: The student's only sixteen, and doesn't have any family ties to the desert. So where could he have seen that emblem, or gotten the paper?
Tighnari: You said you ran into Cyno, yes? Did you tell him what you've just told us?
Kaveh: Yep. He ran off as soon as he heard what we said.
Tighnari: Given that Cyrus is involved, he's probably halfway through solving the case by now...
Tighnari: Still, we should try to catch up with him. At this hour of the night, Cyno will probably go looking for Cyrus at his current residence.
Kaveh: Hmm, if the Akademiya's Temple of Silence really does exist just to cover up the truth, the sudden appearance of this emblem can't be good. It's sure to stir up trouble...
Kaveh: We should pay a visit to the Akademiya.
Tighnari: Yes. As the sage of Amurta, my master ought to know the truth about their office. You can ask him to tell you what he knows. The more information we have, the better prepared we'll be for whatever happens there.
Alhaitham: If this situation is connected to the real Temple of Silence, the emblem has to be part of a bigger conspiracy.
Tighnari: Collei, could I trouble you to send a message to the Corps of Thirty? Tell them to keep an eye out for Cyno and Cyrus.
Tighnari: #Traveler, Paimon, you two come with me. We'll go after Cyno.
Kaveh: Sounds like a plan. Let's go.

## Talk 5

Tighnari: Here we are. This is the place.
Paimon: We might be too late. Looks like nobody's home...
Paimon: Cyno moves fast. If he was here, he's probably long gone by now...
Zaha Hadi: I know that voice... Is that Tighnari I hear?
Tighnari: Ah, Professor Zaha Hadi!
Zaha Hadi: Wow, so it really is you. My goodness, whatever is going on tonight?
Tighnari: We're looking for Cyno... So he's already been here?
Zaha Hadi: Yes, not long ago, in fact. He knocked on my door, and asked if I'd seen Cyrus today at all.
Zaha Hadi: I told him that the old fool left early this morning, and I hadn't heard him come back. So we went to his place, and would you believe it — he's gone! Goodness knows where to.
Zaha Hadi: It must have alarmed Cyno, because he took off in an awful hurry after that. He never did explain what this was all about... *sigh* How serious is it?
Paimon: Well, if Cyrus isn't at home... it sure doesn't sound good...
Tighnari: Professor, did you hear that a student recently tried to extort Cyrus?
Zaha Hadi: Why, yes. When I left the house that day, I noticed he was watering his flowers in the field in complete silence. He had a piece of paper clutched in his hand, and he looked lost in thought.
Zaha Hadi: I could tell something was troubling him, but he wouldn't tell me what it was. If Cyno hadn't happened to visit him that day, he'd probably still be holding onto that thing.
Zaha Hadi: After seeing the letter, Cyno told him to contact the Corps of Thirty, but Cyrus was very reluctant. He claimed it would only damage his reputation. Eventually, he relented, after much persuasion from Cyno.
Paimon: Huh? Cyrus didn't want to report it? Well, that's strange. When we saw him, he seemed pretty okay with the idea of the kid getting his just deserts...
Zaha Hadi: As a former sage, it's possible Cyrus still has enemies at the Akademiya. That's why Cyno was so insistent that he report the matter to the authorities. I was there while they were going back and forth over it.
Tighnari: (So, Cyrus initially hoped to stop this from going public... But why?)
Traveler: (He only reported it because Cyno forced him to. Which means... Cyrus must know something about the Temple of Silence.)
Zaha Hadi: Oh dear... What on earth has that old fool gotten himself wrapped up in? I do hope he's not in danger...
Zaha Hadi: Oh, I almost forgot — Cyno left me this letter to pass onto you. He wrote it when he came by earlier. He realized you might come looking for him.
Tighnari: Thank you.
Paimon: What does it say? Let Paimon take a look...
Paimon: "My friends, this is a rather complicated state of affair. Unfortunately, I cannot disclose more than that. I ask you to understand and accept that I had to act alone at this stage. Don't come after me."
Tighnari: Yep, that sounds like Cyno... Thank you, Professor. Please do not worry — we will do all we can to protect both Cyno and Cyrus.
Tighnari: #Traveler, Paimon, let's head to the Akademiya and regroup.

## Talk 6

Kaveh: You're here? I thought you were going after... Ah, I guess you lost their trail.
Tighnari: We went to Cyrus's house. No one was there. Cyno got there before us, but he was long gone by the time we arrived.
Kaveh: He didn't say where he was going?
Paimon: No. He left us a letter, and told us to not go after him.
Black Screen Text: Tighnari shares what you learned from Zaha Hadi.
Alhaitham: Can't say I'm surprised.
Kaveh: *sigh* Typical Cyno...
Kaveh: Anyway, some updates on progress on our end — I drew the emblem from memory again, but in more detail this time.
Alhaitham: I checked some ancient texts for a similar design. The one I found was a little blurry, but the similarities in the general form and certain details were clear enough to confirm a match.
Kaveh: Yeah, and we're lucky we found anything at all. Turns out the emblem was all but lost to history. We scoured the entire Akademiya collection, and that book was the only one with a record of the motif.
Alhaitham: Meanwhile, Aarav managed to get Urraca to disclose his source.
Alhaitham: The one who told him about Cyrus's embezzled funds was a young man from the desert. According to Urraca, he had a striking presence and was well educated.
Kaveh: Apparently, the two met in the tavern over a game of cards. The guy claimed to be in the city for business, as part of a merchant caravan.
Kaveh: Urraca was intrigued when he heard what his new acquaintance had to say, and brought up the idea of extorting Cyrus for Mora. The guy encouraged him to go ahead with it, then handed him some pen and paper to write the letter.
Tighnari: I see... So it could be that this person planted the paper intentionally.
Paimon: So how do we find this guy? Did Urraca say where he is?
Kaveh: He doesn't know. He claims not to have seen him since that day in the tavern. The man gave him some tips on how to carry out the extortion, but from then on Urraca was acting alone.
Alhaitham: Naphis and Aarav have gone to meet the Corps of Thirty and review the city's entry and exit records.
Alhaitham: Also, Naphis admitted that the Temple of Silence in the Akademiya is just a facade.
Alhaitham: The true Temple of Silence once came to the rainforest to establish a collaboration with the Akademiya, but as time went by, the sages gradually became corrupt and foolish.
Alhaitham: The Temple of Silence felt that they could no longer trust the Akademiya, and ended the partnership. They retreated back to the desert about four hundred years ago.
Alhaitham: Ever since its inception, the Temple of Silence has been the guardians of King Deshret's civilization and belief system. They traveled throughout Sumeru, sequestering and guarding any wisdom that posed a threat to the people's livelihoods.
Alhaitham: At its roots, it was a legitimate and reputable organization whose purpose was to guide people towards the right path.
Tighnari: ...The Akademiya of the day knew that the split would damage their reputation if it became a matter of public knowledge. And so, they set up a dummy organization of their own to conceal the truth.
Paimon: Not only that, but they managed to keep up the charade for hundreds of years...
Tighnari: So how did Cyrus become acquainted with the true Temple of Silence if they left centuries ago?
Kaveh: I'll bet that's the question that bothered Cyno. Probably why he went after him in such a rush.
Alhaitham: Whoever is behind this, getting Urraca to extort Cyrus was only the first step of the plan. Their true goal in doing so was for Cyrus to see the emblem on the letter.
Kaveh: He must have recognized it right away. That'll be why he didn't want to involve the authorities. He probably hoped to take care of the whole thing by himself... Unfortunately for him, Cyno had other plans.
Alhaitham: Since the desert is where the Temple of Silence originated, that is in all likelihood where Cyrus went.
Tighnari: ...I have to go after him.
Kaveh: Really? Are you sure that's a good idea, with how you respond to the heat? Why don't we send someone else?
Tighnari: I should be fine as long as I bring plenty of water. Besides, I just can't shake this ominous feeling that if we don't catch up to them soon... *sigh*
Naphis: Everyone, I have news from the Corps of Thirty.
Tighnari: Master.
Paimon: Oh, so that's Naphis, Tighnari's Master? Whoa, we're finally getting to meet him in person.
Traveler: Hello.
Naphis: #It's a pleasure to meet you, Traveler and Paimon.
Naphis: Several independent eyewitnesses have reported seeing Cyrus and Mahamatra Cyno leaving the city at different times. Both were heading in the direction of Caravan Ribat.
Naphis: I was going to suggest that you join forces with the Corps of Thirty in this case, however... as I'm sure you've already heard from Alhaitham and Kaveh, the Temple of Silence is involved.
Naphis: The Akademiya has made a number of decisions throughout history that I am ashamed to talk about. It may well be that no better choice was available to them, but those actions are nonetheless a stain on our legacy.
Naphis: I won't attempt to make you understand the Akademiya's perspective. Now is the time for action.
Tighnari: I understand where you're coming from, Master, but I'm afraid the situation might be more complicated than we thought. I think... we need to keep a low profile, or risk making things worse.
Naphis: ...Good point. If Cyrus is involved with the other side... Or worse, if he's fallen into their hands, and...
Naphis: *sigh* Everyone, we have to get Cyrus and Cyno back safely. We cannot afford to lose them.
Paimon: Need our help? Whatever you need, we got you covered!
Naphis: Really? Wonderful, you have my most sincere gratitude.
Naphis: Aarav and I will continue to follow up on the lead from Urraca. Kaveh, Scribe Alhaitham, I'd like to ask you to cover the duties of the House of Daena.
Naphis: Tighnari. You're planning to go into the desert, correct?
Tighnari: I am. Kaveh, I'll be okay. You stay behind to help Master and Alhaitham.
Kaveh: Well, if you're sure... Okay. But be careful.
Naphis: Thank you all. Aarav, let's go.
Alhaitham: You'd better get moving. Don't forget to ask for help when you need it.
Paimon: Will do! Let's go, Tighnari. Hopefully we can catch up with Cyno before it's too late.
Tighnari: Knowing him, he's probably covered a fair distance already. But we still have a shot. Let's take it.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Kaveh: There's a lot of strange things about this situation. Ugh, what a mess.
Kaveh: Lemme think... current and former associates would be a good place to start... Argh, but how would I know who Cyrus is acquainted with? Cyno didn't mention any names, either.
Kaveh: ...We just have to work with what we've got, I suppose.
Kaveh: Huh? What's that you're reading?
Alhaitham: An index of the Akademiya's book collection. I recall there being some books that reference the Temple of Silence, but they're few and far between.
Kaveh: ...How long's that gonna take you? It's like looking for a needle in a haystack!
Alhaitham: I'll manage.
Kaveh: ...
Kaveh: Alright, fine! I'll help you look through them. We'll be here all night otherwise.
Alhaitham: It's a shame there's no coffee around here.
Kaveh: *sigh* If I'd known what we were getting into, I would have made some before leaving the house...
Kaveh: Actually... Alhaitham, have you ever met anyone from the Temple of Silence? The phonies from the Akademiya branch, I mean.
Alhaitham: A few times. Their workload is even lighter than mine, so they often leave the office to chat with whoever's nearby.
Kaveh: How do you know all this? Do you join in with these chats?
Alhaitham: Is that a serious question? I just go about my business and pretend not to have heard anything they said.
Kaveh: Wait, but how does that work? Can you teach me? I feel like that'd be a really useful skill...
Alhaitham: ...
Kaveh: ...
Alhaitham: ...
Kaveh: Hey! Stop ignoring me!
Alhaitham: See? That's all there is to it.

### Additional Talk 2

Zaha Hadi: I can't believe this is happening to Cyrus, of all people... How does a man of his age end up at the center of all this fuss?
Zaha Hadi: He always seemed so carefree. Cyno and his friends visit him on a regular basis, and there's never any drama. I honestly thought he lived a worry-free life.
Zaha Hadi: *sigh* We've had our quarrels, but it's always over the silliest little things. Now he's in real trouble, I just wish there was some way I could help.
Zaha Hadi: And... Oh, what about our tomato-growing contest? He has to see it through! His plants are doing so well... but they need their gardener to come back safe and sound.

### Additional Talk 3

Collei: Mr. Asfand!
Asfand: Collei! What's wrong?
Collei: We've got an emergency! Mahamatra Cyno and former Sage Cyrus have gone missing... They could be in danger!
Collei: Are you able to spare some people to keep the city secure? And also keep an eye out in case they show up?
Asfand: My goodness... Understood. I'll get on the case immediately.
Collei: If you have any questions, be sure to contact the Akademiya.
Asfand: Will do. Don't worry, Miss Collei — we'll do everything in our power to find them.
Collei: Got it! Thank you so much!
