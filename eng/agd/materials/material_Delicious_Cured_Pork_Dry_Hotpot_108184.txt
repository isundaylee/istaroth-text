# Delicious Cured Pork Dry Hotpot

A dish fried over a great flame. The rendered fat from the fried ham layers the side dishes perfectly, and the flavors have long permeated the whole dish. Its shine alone is enough to whet one's appetite, and every bite is sure to evoke memories of house, home, and celebration in anyone from Liyue.
