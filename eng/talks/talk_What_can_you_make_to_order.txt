Traveler: What can you make to order?
Mikoshi Genichirou: What would you like? Just tell me, and I will do my best to make it happen.
Mikoshi Genichirou: This store may not be as famous as those old family stores on this street, but we are still proud of our fine craftsmanship.
Mikoshi Genichirou: To be honest, I'm actually the eldest son of my family, but people always say that I am simple and dull, and that I probably won't be able to carry on with the family business.
Mikoshi Genichirou: Haha, that's why I would rather start a small store here and help the neighbors out with my handiwork.
