Mikhail: Hey, have you heard what our superiors have been saying? The Vision Hunt Decree that Inazuma was strictly enforcing has been abolished!
Lyudmila: The Vision Hunt Decree... Wasn't that something that the Electro Archon promulgated herself? To think that even one so exalted as an Archon could change their mind...
Lyudmila: Well, the more shocking thing I've heard is that Lady Signora, the Eighth of the Harbingers, was...
Mikhail: Well, about that... I think that some sacrifices were inevitable on the path of Her Majesty's great work.
Lyudmila: But Lady Signora's a Harbinger... What happened, I wonder, that she wound up losing her life?
Mikhail: Who knows? People change, after all. Perhaps her strength was insufficient to remain a Harbinger. I don't believe that such a thing would have happened to her otherwise...
Mikhail: Just you wait. I'm sure that our Eighth seat will be filled by someone even more powerful. And when that happens, we Fatui will be all the stronger for it!
