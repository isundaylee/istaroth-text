Traveler: Been busy with anything lately?
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: Lately, you say... Well, I have been thinking about land management of late.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: I'm not sure if you've noticed, but there is an island to our south known as Tsurumi Island that has been locked off by perpetual fog, the point where few people dare enter.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: For some unknown reason, the fog has cleared recently, so I and my colleagues are presently discussing if we should put a team together to survey the area.
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: If we could undertake some development there, it would be quite the contribution to Inazuma...
Nagaoka Hidemitsu: However, the situation isn't all that clear yet, so it may be some time yet before we come to a conclusion.
