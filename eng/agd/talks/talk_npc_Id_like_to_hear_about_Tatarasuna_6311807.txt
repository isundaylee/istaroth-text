Traveler: I'd like to hear about Tatarasuna...
Miyazaki Saburou: The Mikage Furnace there is infused with technology from Fontaine. It is the smelting center of Inazuma. Before the incident happened, I worked over there.
Miyazaki Saburou: There is an island called Nazuchi Beach to the west of Tatarasuna. It is part of Yashiori Island.
Miyazaki Saburou: Nazuchi Beach is also a chaotic place plagued by war. There are even some pirates who managed to set up their lair over there during the tumult. If you can't handle yourself well, it is very dangerous to go that way.
