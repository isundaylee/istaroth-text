Buttercup of Terror: Would you like to play a round with me?
Traveler: Let's get to it!
Buttercup of Terror: Alright! I'm gonna learn how you fight, err, White... Melon-thing!
Traveler: Could you tell me about your nickname?
Buttercup of Terror: You mean "Buttercup of Terror"?
Buttercup of Terror: Oh, it came about because Daddy once gave me a buttercup flower, which I put by my windowsill every night. But by the next morning, it would have raced up to the roof.
Buttercup of Terror: Someone said that they saw my flower climbing the walls in the dead of night just like a cat...
Buttercup of Terror: It was later that we found that there was a cat in the city that had taken a liking to my plant, which led to it making off with the plant.
Buttercup of Terror: I don't know why, but as the story spread, it somehow became "The buttercup Changchang raised turned into a cat. Terrifying!"
Buttercup of Terror: Not that I mind, but... when that "Grandmaster Avocado" person heard about this, they thought that my nickname was really cool, and they even asked me to play this game...
Buttercup of Terror: And well, I'm having loads of fun, and I'd love to play more!
Traveler: See you!
Buttercup of Terror: Yup, I'll see you too!
