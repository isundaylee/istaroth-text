Sugiyama: Why hasn't it arrived yet? I'm starving over here...

## Talk

Traveler: Waiting for someone?
Sugiyama: You bet! The guard who was supposed to take over from me should have arrived ages ago.
Sugiyama: But for some reason, I don't see anyone coming along. Did he meet with some trouble along the way?
Sugiyama: I should probably check on him... But the path here is treacherously steep, and if I leave, no one's going to be watching it... Ugh, what do I do...

## Talk

Traveler: See you around.
Sugiyama: See you. I guess I'll wait a while longer...

## Talk

Traveler: This place is pretty high up, yes.
Sugiyama: I know, right? Someone needs to stand guard here at all times to advise people to watch their step â€” and so that no one will fall down unseen.
Sugiyama: This is one of the paths to Sangonomiya Shrine, after all, so no small number of shrine maidens, soldiers, and residents pass this way.
Sugiyama: ...Whatever the case, I just hope that the person taking over the shift gets here soon. I need to eat real bad...
