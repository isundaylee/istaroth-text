# Missing title (704456687)

Manqu: Oh, hello. How have you been lately?
Manqu: Or is there something you would like to confirm?
Traveler: About the Flamelord's Blessing...
Manqu: The Flamelord's Blessing... Some hold that it is a kind of atavism, because everyone has always been convinced that this power must stem from a deeper, ancestral source.
Manqu: Yet, according to the Saurian Relics Association's records, these young Saurians that bear this mark are wracked by uncontrollable forces that rise within their bodies as they grow...
Manqu: This power rips and tears their bodies, turning them into something altogether different from regular Saurians... It drives them berserk, and causes them to lose their sanity.
Manqu: The best example is Holawaqa, the Qucusaur tyrant... It is said that it once had the Flamelord's Blessing bestowed upon it.
Traveler: How would the tribe "deal with the matter," again?
Manqu: They would send him back to the Night Kingdom, for while he could perhaps never gain the acceptance of the dragons or the Night Kingdom while he lives...
Manqu: ...Once he has left this world, he will without doubt return to the embrace of the night. This may seem cold, yet there he would be reunited with the souls of all beings...
Manqu: Forgive my presumption, but perhaps that too might be seen as a form of kindness.
Traveler: Any clues about the token?
Manqu: Some, but... I need to find someone who can confirm them. Later on, perhaps you'll find me over with Pacal, leader of the Children of Echoes.
Manqu: He might look a little... over the top, perhaps, but in all frankness, he's more reliable than the most solid of crystals.
Traveler: I have no more questions. Goodbye!
Manqu: Your visits are always welcome, friend.
