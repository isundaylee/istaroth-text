# Talk Dialog

Lisa: It's getting harder to make small talk these days. Even something as innocuous as "what fine weather we're having today" seems to fall completely flat...
Traveler: Tell me about the library.
Lisa: You can visit whenever you need to look something up.
Lisa: Naturally the library is free to access.
Lisa: Just don't forget to return books on time, or you'll make my job difficult.
Traveler: I'd like to know more about monsters.
Lisa: The monsters out in the wild? We've got many resources here in the library.
Lisa: Making good use of elemental advantages is the key to winning any battle.
Lisa: By the way, would you be interested in having a part-time job here?
Lisa: We need people to... need people for doing... We just need more people.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Lisa: You're leaving? Drop by again sometime when you're free.
