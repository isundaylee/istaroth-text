# Talk Dialog

Ramiz: Grandma, may I ask you a question? Nawaz and I have been thinking about this one, but we still don't get it.
Kulsoom: Oh, of course you can, dear.
Ramiz: So, uh... Grandma, is King Deshret really gonna come back from the dead...?
Kulsoom: ...!
Ramiz: Grandma?
Kulsoom: Those fanatic believers! Can't they spare the children!?
Kulsoom: Child, please, listen well. Though gods are indeed very powerful, even they can disappear.
Kulsoom: Being obsessed with things that have disappeared is madness. It is no way to live.
Kulsoom: *sigh* If only the desert children had the chance to learn a little more. Then they wouldn't easily fall for such lies...
Kulsoom: Child, I... I know this is a lot to ask, but please, study hard â€” you should learn a thing or two from Setaria.
Ramiz: I... I understand.
