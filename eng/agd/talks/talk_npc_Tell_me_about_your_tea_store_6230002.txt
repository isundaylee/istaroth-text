# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Tell me about your tea store.
Pops Kai: I set up shop here to provide some respite from the grueling and relentless farm work, both for old friends and for anyone else passing by.
Pops Kai: But as you can see, business could be a little better, hehehe.
Pops Kai: Still. Every time someone comes to me for a cup of tea and a chat, I think to myself, this is worth my while.
