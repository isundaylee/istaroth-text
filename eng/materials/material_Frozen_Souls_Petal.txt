# Frozen Soul's Petal

An uncanny petal. At first glance, it seems like ice molded into the shape of a petal, but it is quite soft to the touch.
"Plant my petal at the ending point of the intersection of melodies, and what had once sunk into the earth will re-emerge with the music."
That's what Frozen Soul said.
