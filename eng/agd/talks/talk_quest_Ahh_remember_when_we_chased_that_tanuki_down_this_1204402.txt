Paimon: Ahh, remember when we chased that tanuki down this way? Good times!
Paimon: Huh? What's that?
Traveler: A tanuki?
Paimon: Paimon doesn't think they look anything like that... Oh, maybe there's a new kind of youkai in town?
Paimon: Umm.... Is it trying to get us to follow it?
Traveler: A piglet?
