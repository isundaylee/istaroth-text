# Lynette Voicelines

## Hello
Pleased to make your acquaintance. I am Lyney's magic assistant, and if you have work-related inquiries, please ask Lyney. If you have questions related to seeing a magic show, please ask the ticket office. You want to talk to me? ...Then get to the point.

## Chat: Drinking Tea
Tea is ready, now it's time for a short rest.

## Chat: Older Brother
Seems Lyney is saying some strange things again... it's really worrying.

## Chat: Spacing Out
Entering Standby Mode... I hope nobody disturbs me.

## When It Rains
Rainy days are perfect for spacing out...

## After the Rain
The skies have cleared? What a pity.

## When Thunder Strikes
Ow... that hurts my ears.

## When It Snows
So cold... let's hide you in a hat!

## When the Sun Is Out
There is nothing new under the sun... Is that really true?

## When the Wind Is Blowing
*sniff* What's that on the breeze? ...Nope, it's nothing.

## Good Morning
Good morning... Not fully recharged. Now snoozing again.

## Good Afternoon
I usually drink a cup of tea before work. Not only does it change my mood, but also helps me stay alert.

## Good Evening
After the sun goes down, the desires hidden in people's hearts will rise to the surface... I mean, evening shows are spectacular. Should I reserve a ticket for you?

## Good Night
Go to sleep, I still have some loose ends to tie up from work today... (I still have to fix the vacuum cleaner I broke.)

## About Lynette: Magic
During our shows, I'm usually Lyney's assistant. Because I never speak or change expressions, people often mistake me for a puppet... this kind of misunderstanding can prevent unnecessary social interactions, so it's actually quite nice.

## About Lynette: Intelligence Reports
Staying silent is beneficial for maintaining focus and gathering intelligence. Once, a VIP audience member at our show took out a handkerchief that didn't belong to his wife... as for how such information is used, now... that depends on what "Father" wants.

## About Us: Listening
I'm not accustomed to expressing myself, but I consider myself a good listener. If you have any troubles, come find me. I'll guard your secrets.

## About Us: Interests
I used to think that the golden sun and dark shadows of the night could never understand one another. But in you, I see a kind of strange complexity that has needlessly piqued my curiosity... I'll have to keep a close eye on you.

## About the Vision
I prefer to use my eyes to understand the situation and find an appropriate solution, as opposed to using martial prowess. But having brute force as an option greatly increases the potential cards at your disposal, and enables you to protect those most important to you in a crisis.

## Something to Share
Making tea looks simple on the surface, but it is actually quite complex. The quality of the tea leaves, the temperature of the water, the number of times to add water... Only when every variable is properly controlled can tea of the purest taste be brewed. Would you like a cup?

## Interesting Things
Animals can also express their feelings. If you listen carefully, you can tell what state they are in. For a kitty, "Meow~" means they are much happier than "Meow meow meow!", and in that situation, you can pet them as much as you want and they won't run away.

## About Lyney: Unspoken Understanding
I have always been together with Lyney, and we can tell what the other is thinking without speaking. Thus, he tends to be more quiet than normal when we are alone. Hmm? Can I tell when he's lying or telling the truth? Of course I can, but this matter is top secret.

## About Lyney: Worries
Lyney is normally quite confident, and does everything with incredible ease... or at least, that's how he wants everyone else to see him. So when he runs into difficulties, he always wants to solve everything perfectly on his own... if this happens, please be sure to take good care of him.

## About Freminet
He is a delicate and gentle child, but also tends to belittle himself... perhaps due to his previous experiences. Sometimes he feels like the antithesis of Lyney... but since they're both family, when their opinions clash, I will bridge their differences.

## About "Father"
Oh, how "Father" expresses love... well, not everyone can accept it. But it is only because of "Father" that home... can be called home.

## About Neuvillette
The Chief Justice always feels strangely aloof, though his words are always humble... or perhaps he just doesn't like dealing with humans? After all, when he speaks with Melusines, he's actually quite friendly.

## About Furina
Lady Furina's behavior is incredibly hard to explain, and I can't discern any useful intelligence from observing her. I always feel like her every move and action is an act, and she is playing different people... She truly is an Archon, one cannot apply the logic of ordinary humans to her.

## About Navia
Though she's the new president of Spina di Rosula, her style is more like the nosy big sister next door. If we really had a sister like her in the "House of the Hearth," that would be really great... I know I probably shouldn't be wishing for anyone to be an orphan, but...

## About Clorinde
I was once ordered to observe a duel of hers. Even just as a bystander, the coldness radiating from her was absolutely chilling... I don't know what it would be like to face her directly in a duel, and I hope I will never find out.

## About Chiori
The costumes Lyney and I wear for performances were specially tailored by Chiori. Once, Lyney was using a small knife for a magic trick, and accidentally cut the cuff of his sleeve a bit. She scolded us nonstop... it was scary. Luckily, I can hide behind Lyney whenever we go to her shop.

## About Charlotte
Uh... I was eventually cornered by her for interviews a few times. The way she persistently asked even after Lyney rejected her all those times, I really have to commend her perseverance. Too bad for her, though... despite preparing all those questions, I never answered a single one.

## About Emilie
Her perfume products are so popular that you have to get in line before the break of dawn to have a chance at snapping any up. However, I'm far too sensitive to the smell of perfume, and it's really rude to sneeze... so I have to take the long way around.

## About Escoffier
Hmm... I saw her tail wagging today. Must mean the new confection she came up with is a keeper. I'm looking forward trying it at the next tea party.

## More About Lynette: I
If you explain a magic trick, then the allure of the performance is lost. Personal relationships are the same. If you want to understand me, why not learn a bit at a time, and gradually piece together a complete picture?

## More About Lynette: II
Humans are complicated creatures. Even when they are not doing so intentionally, they will still unconsciously hide their true selves. Though I can always notice a few "redundant" details, I won't expose their facades when it isn't necessary.

## More About Lynette: III
Magic shows were once our livelihood, but now they are more of a convenient identity to present to society. In the name of magic performances, we can easily gain more access throughout the city, and be the "eyes" of our House.

## More About Lynette: IV
Before Lyney and I came to our new home, we were constantly adrift on the streets. We experienced many hardships and dangerous situations... It was then that I developed the habit of paying attention to any sign of danger, and also gradually learned to understand what others were thinking. Fortunately, we now have a safe place to live.

## More About Lynette: V
Building a relationship with someone is like gambling. No matter how much information you have, it's hard to predict how other people might change. I've always had the habit of keeping a safe distance from others, but in your case... I'm willing to shoulder the risk of losing a bet.

## Lynette's Hobbies
A person's mental state is like a bowstring. If it's constantly under high tension, it will be at risk of suddenly snapping. So outside of work, I prefer to do things that relax my brain, like making tea, feeding cats, and just zoning out. The calmer one normally is, the easier it is to deal with crises when they do pop up.

## Lynette's Troubles
I tend to have difficulties operating any kind of machinery. As soon as I stop paying attention, all kinds of things start to go wrong. Once, I even broke the dryer on a rainy day... At least Freminet is good at fixing things.

## Favorite Food
Pry open the shells, squeeze a bit of lemon juice onto the fresh shellfish... no plate necessary. Perfection.

## Least Favorite Food
Dishes should not be over-seasoned. Good food preserves the original taste of the ingredients.

## Receiving a Gift: I
Delicious. I've already memorized the recipe.

## Receiving a Gift: II
Thank you for your generosity.

## Receiving a Gift: III
Perhaps you could reconsider the spice ratio a bit?

## Birthday
Happy Birthday! Let me give you this card... it's not a greeting card, so of course nothing's written on it. Write down what kind of present you want, place it in my hat, and no matter what it might be, you'll get it.

## Feelings About Ascension: Intro
My perception has been heightened.

## Feelings About Ascension: Building Up
My processing speed... has become even faster.

## Feelings About Ascension: Climax
I can see the conditions for victory now.

## Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion
I never imagined I could become this powerful... looks like I won't need to hide behind you anymore.
