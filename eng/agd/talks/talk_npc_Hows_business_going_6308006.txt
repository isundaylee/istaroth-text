Traveler: How's business going?
Vahid: Why would you ask that? Of course...
Vahid: ...Ah, never mind. I'll be honest with you.
Vahid: Before the Sakoku Decree, we still had Inazuma locals coming from Narukami Island to purchase our goods.
Vahid: But ever since the Sakoku Decree took effect, only a few people have come. It's getting harder to do business, and I'm not sure how long we can last...
Vahid: Dear customer, would you like some Anahitian Blessing? How about buying it as a souvenir for your journey here?
