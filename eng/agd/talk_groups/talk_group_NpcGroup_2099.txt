Manager Kuan: *sigh* How did this happen...
Traveler: Is something wrong?
Manager Kuan: Oh, what would it be if not the problem with the Blackcliff Forge? Things were going so well for us, too. Ore production was high and workplace accidents were low.
Manager Kuan: But a band of monsters suddenly came out of nowhere and took over one of our work sites.
Manager Kuan: The Millelith tried to give them the boot many times, but they returned with greater numbers every single time.
Manager Kuan: To ensure the workers' safety, I had to pull everyone back from the area.
Manager Kuan: But if that site is down, the production pressures on the others go up. This could throw the whole Forge's production schedules into disarray!
Manager Kuan: And I would go myself to investigate, but I dare not leave my daughter here or bring her along...
Manager Kuan: If you would, Traveler, could you go to that worksite and help me check it out?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Manager Kuan: Thanks. I'll be waiting for you here.

## Talk 1

Traveler: Allow me.
Manager Kuan: Thank you very much. I'll be waiting for you here.

## Talk 2

Traveler: Work at the Blackcliff Forge has been stopped?
Manager Kuan: It has. The order for us to cease work was sent directly from the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Manager Kuan: How could they just stop work at the drop of a hat like that? How will everyone get by? And we need their approval to resume work as well... *sigh*
Manager Kuan: Please, help me to investigate the area around the Chasm.

## Talk 3

Yiran: Manager Kuan! I want to buy a kite!
Manager Kuan: How many times do I have to tell you, just call me "Daddy." Now, if you study hard, Daddy will buy you one, alright?
Yiran: No! Aren't you the shift supervisor of the Blackcliff Forge, Manager Kuan? As the supervisor, it's up to you to set an example.
Manager Kuan: But Daddy has to work, and you have to study. These are two completely differ—
Yiran: Then let's talk about work! "Let our actions be recognized by hard work. Let our achievements be what speaks first." Isn't that right?
Manager Kuan: That's right, that's the Blackcliff Forge motto... How'd you remember that so clearly?
Yiran: So let's start from your actions. If you buy me the kite, Manager Kuan, then I will recognize your hard work!
Manager Kuan: How many times do I have to say it — I'm "Daddy"! And how did this suddenly become about me? It's like you're trapping me in...
Yiran: You're the one that started talking about work, aren't you?
Manager Kuan: *sigh* Alright, then. I'll buy you a kite. But from now on, you must call me "Daddy."
Yiran: Alright, "Daddy"! Now, Daddy! Do as you promised!
