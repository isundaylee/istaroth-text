Traveler: About Benny's Adventure Team
Paimon: If you want to adventure together with Benny's Adventure Team, you have to come prepared.
Paimon: Domains are very dangerous, so you should always take care to double and triple check your supplies in advance.
Paimon: Paimon's heard that the Adventurers' Guild has compiled a list of four hundred and sixty-three different ways of dying in these domains...
Paimon: If Bennett got you killed by accident, Paimon and Bennett would never forgive ourselves!
Traveler: ...Why am I the only one dying here?
Paimon: Well, that's because according to the numbers, Paimon can avoid three hundred and twenty-two causes of death just by floating!
Traveler: I suddenly don't feel like exploring these domains...
