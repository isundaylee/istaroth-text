Traveler: What are you mumbling about?
Esther: Oh, hello. I'm an environmentalist and researcher of geography. I'm currently investigating the terrain here.
Esther: To find a snow-capped mountain right here in Mondstadt, given the climate in the rest of the region, is really quite fascinating.
Esther: I've seen similar circumstances elsewhere in the past, such as the Chasm in Liyue, so there may be some similarities in their respective terrain features...
Esther: I wanted to go up the mountain to do some proper research, but I was stopped by that Knight of Favonius. A real spoilsport, that one.
