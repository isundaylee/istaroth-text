Traveler: Just keep your eyes on the pot.
Ami: Do I need to keep watching until it's done?
Ami: Um... That actually makes sense. If you don't pay attention, bugs might fly in, or you might overcook it.
Ami: Ah, cooking is so complicated! Why doesn't everyone just eat fresh fruits? They are so sweet and delicious!
Ami: That way, no one has to cook or worry about bugs and overcooking!
