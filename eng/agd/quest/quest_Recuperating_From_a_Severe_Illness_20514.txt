# Recuperating From a Severe Illness


## Talk 1

Anthony: How did this happen...
Traveler: What's wrong?
Anthony: Oh, it's you. Just in time, too. Anna's been getting better ever since eating the medicine prescribed by that doctor.
Anthony: When she wasn't well, she needed a lot of rest, and so spent a lot of time convalescing at home.
Anthony: Now that she's better, she's started pestering me every day to go out at play, and I couldn't refuse her.
Anthony: But now, I absolutely cannot find her. I have no idea where she's gone. Please help me find her!
Traveler: I... Alright.
Anthony: I'll be waiting here. Please hurry.
Anthony: She just got better, and now she's scampering about. What will we do if something happens to her...?
Anthony: I've already been searching for quite a while. I haven't looked in the vicinity of the Adventurers' Guild yet, but I'm just beat at this point...
Anthony: You should start your search over there. Who knows, maybe Cyrus has noticed something...
Anthony: I hope you find her, or I'll have to go out again...
Traveler: You seem quite happy about it.
Anthony: Happy? This is no laughing matter. She's only gotten a little better, and now she's flying about like a kite!
Anthony: When she gets back, I'll give her what for.
Traveler: She'll come back once she gets hungry.
Anthony: Are you taking my sister for some sort of cat? And she's only just recovered. How can we let her go hungry?
Anthony: Alright, alright. Please help me find her, I'll be waiting for you here.

## Talk 2

Anna: I'm so high up! My brother will never find me here!
Traveler: What are you doing here...
Anna: Wah! How'd you get up here, and without a sound, too!
Anna: No, wait. How did you even find me?
Anna: Me? I just climbed up here.
Anna: My brother's looking for me? Huh. It's been some time, hasn't it? I hadn't noticed.
Anna: I got it. I'll go back soon. Just let me stay here for a while...

## Talk 3

Anthony: Have you found Anna?
Traveler: She's on top of a windmill.
Anthony: A windmill!? How did that girl get up there? I'm calling the Knights of Favonius right now!
Traveler: She said she'll be back soon.
Anthony: Oâ€”Oh. Is that so? Well, she's fine, and that's what matters. You scared me there for a moment! I thought she was stuck on top of a windmill.
Anthony: Thank you, I'll go look for her now.
Anthony: Running off like that when she's only just recovered... I have to teach her a lesson.

## Talk 4

Cyrus: Oh? You're here? That's unusual.
Traveler: Have you seen a certain girl?
Cyrus: A girl? Oh, you mean Anna? I did see her. She was heading for that windmill over there.
Cyrus: I'm still quite puzzled by it, myself. I thought she was unwell. Where did she suddenly get all that energy from?
Cyrus: She greeted me and just ran by.
Cyrus: That kid... Do you have any idea when she recovered from her illness?

## Talk 5

Anna: I'm so high up! My brother will never find me here!
Traveler: What are you doing here...
Anna: Whoa! How'd you get up here, and without a sound, too!
Anna: Also, how did you even find me?
Anna: Ah, I know. Mr. Cyrus must have told you.
Anna: He's always taken care of my brother and I, and I greeted him as I was passing by. He looked so surprised, too!
Anna: Maybe I should try out for the Adventurers' Guild and become an Adventurer. That might be nice!
Anna: What? My brother's looking for me? Huh. It's been some time, hasn't it? I hadn't noticed at all!
Anna: I got it. Just let me stay here for a while, I'll go back myself.

## Talk 6

Anthony: Have you found Anna yet?
Traveler: She's on top of a windmill.
Anthony: A windmill!? How did that girl get up there? I'm going up there right now...
Anthony: What? She wants to try becoming an adventurer?
Anthony: She's getting ahead of herself, she hasn't even fully recovered yet!
Anthony: Don't get me wrong. Once she's well, I don't have any problems with her going out to see the world.
Anthony: Thanks, I'll go look for her. Running off like that when she's only just recovered... I have to teach her a lesson.
