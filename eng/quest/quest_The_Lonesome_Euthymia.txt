# The Lonesome Euthymia


## Talk 1

Thoma: If the Tenryou Commission won't assist in dealing with the thunderstorm, the consequences could be catastrophic.
Kujou Kamaji: It's not that we're unwilling to do our part. We just don't have any spare hands right now. I hope you can understand.
Ippei: Exactly. So let's keep the discussion going, and see if we can find a solution.
Paimon: Hey, Thoma! What's going on?
Thoma: Ah, hello you two. We were just talking about what an impact you've made in Inazuma.
Traveler: What a coincidence.
Kujou Kamaji: Greetings. Thank you both again for delivering Miss Hiiragi's letter that time.
Ippei: Ah, so they're friends of yours. I'm Master Kamaji's servant. Call me Ippei!
Traveler: Sounds like you're having some trouble?
Thoma: Well, the Tri-Commission's work used to consist of gathering information for the Shogun and carrying out any duties she assigned.
Thoma: But recently, she announced that she wishes to spend some time in solitude and self-reflection. Since she is refusing to receive any visitors, there is no one to tell us what to do.
Thoma: We all understand if the Shogun needs some quiet time to gather her thoughts. The only problem is, in the meantime, the thunderstorm out at sea has been getting wilder.
Traveler: I hear that storm represents the Shogun's will.
Thoma: Yup, that's the one, and in all the time it's been there, the storm has never changed in shape or size. But now, it seems to be drawing closer to Inazuma.
Paimon: What!? So her will's changed and she wants to destroy Inazuma now? Or is this her way of trying to get revenge on us?
Traveler: That would be a little childish.
Paimon: Oh, yeah, you're right. If she really wanted to get revenge on us, she could just strike us with lightning right here...
Paimon: ...Which would also be pretty scary!
Thoma: Haha, I don't think you need to worry about that. The reason we're concerned is that we've never known the Almighty Shogun's will to falter before.
Kujou Kamaji: Considering Liyue's god left not too long ago, it's hard not to take it as a bad sign.
Kujou Kamaji: A lot of people now believe that the thunderstorm is getting wilder because the Almighty Shogun is having health problems. The fact that she won't see anyone right now makes us concerned that things are only going to get worse.
Traveler: That seems like a valid concern.
Thoma: Right. So, before rumors start spreading, Miss Kamisato got me to come here and discuss countermeasures with the Tenryou Commission. We need to make sure we're prepared to deal with the chaos if and when it arrives.
Kujou Kamaji: Unfortunately, the reality is that the Tenryou Commission is facing huge internal instability at the moment. The Kujou Clan has lost control over the other clans.
Paimon: Huh? Why is that?
Kujou Kamaji: The Kujou Clan is still awaiting the Shogun's trial for colluding with the Fatui and nearly destroying the whole of Inazuma.
Kujou Kamaji: Everyone knows that a change of Commissioner is inevitable. It's just a matter of time before the Almighty Shogun hands down her decree.
Thoma: To put it simply, no one will take orders from the Kujou Clan anymore, but there's still work that has to be done.
Ippei: If Mr. Takayuki was in better health, there might be a way through. But now...
Kujou Kamaji: My lack of ability is to blame. I failed to uncover the truth in time, and I failed to stop my father. And now, as acting head of the clan, I'm failing to quell the unrest.
Ippei: Don't blame yourself, Master. You have to at least keep your chin up until your older brother returns. The Kujou Clan can't cope with any more instability in its current state.
Kujou Kamaji: Yes, you're right. Masahito has enough on his plate at the moment. I mustn't cause any more issues for him.
Kujou Kamaji: Okay. Thoma, let's revisit this discussion in a few days. Right now, I need to go visit Takatsukasa Susumu, head of the Takatsukasa Clan. He is the only one capable of taking charge of the situation now.
Thoma: Hmmm...I suppose. Okay, no problem. A speedy resolution to the Tenryou Commission's internal issues is in our best interests as well.
Ippei: I'll come with you, Master!
Kujou Kamaji: No need. I'll handle this by myself.
Ippei: Oh okay... take care, then. Come back soon!
Paimon: If you think about it, both the thunderstorm situation and the issue with the Tenryou Commission have been caused by the Shogun's decision to take some time off, right?
Paimon: If things carry on like this, people will start to panic...
Traveler: Maybe we could invite her out for a while?
Ippei: Huh? You can actually do that!?
Paimon: Don't know for sure, but we may as well try. Whether she takes us up on the offer or not will depend on what mood she's in...
Thoma: Sounds like you guys know what to do. Shall I leave it up to you, then?
Thoma: Everyone's worrying about the Shogun's condition, but if people got to see her in person, it would put their fears to rest.
Traveler: I'll try.
Thoma: #Thank you very much, {NICKNAME}. I owe you one, again.
Paimon: The way Paimon sees it, there's only one person who might have the chance to see the Shogun while she's isolating. Right?
Paimon: Let's take a trip to the Grand Narukami Shrine!
Traveler: There must be a reason for the change in the storm.
Traveler: Are you really scared of her?
Paimon: Nuh-uh, she lost to us. Paimon's not scared, why would Paimon be scared!
Paimon: Paimon's just, y'know, a little... concerned that she might be angry. Yeah, that's all, just a little concerned.
Traveler: Are you mocking me?

## Talk 2

Inagi Hotomi: Are you here to see Lady Yae?
Inagi Hotomi: She was inside a moment ago, but her movements are always a source of mystery â€” you never know when she might disappear...
Inagi Hotomi: Anyway, you may head in and see if she's there.

## Talk 3

Yae Miko: I wasn't expecting to receive VIP shrine visitors during down time. Hehe, so I suppose you're here just to visit me?
Traveler: Yes, I was.
Yae Miko: What a smooth talker... though, your eyes do not lie as convincingly as your tongue. You came because you need my help, didn't you?
Yae Miko: Still, your answer has put me in a good mood.
Yae Miko: So, tell me. What is the matter?
Paimon: We heard that the Shogun decided to take a break, and since then the thunderstorm around Inazuma has gotten wilder.
Paimon: Rumor has it that the thunderstorm is affected by the Shogun's will. So people are worrying that something might be wrong with her.
Traveler: The Tenryou Commission also needs her attention.
Yae Miko: *sigh*...
Yae Miko: Alright. There's little purpose in keeping anything hidden from you, anyway.
Yae Miko: Since the battle, the Shogun has been greatly troubled and her temperament has changed drastically.
Paimon: What!?
Traveler: Her temperament has changed?
Yae Miko: Her power was already on the decline. Then you dealt her that fateful strike.
Yae Miko: The defeat was a heavy blow to her. It also didn't help that I forgot to bring her some Tricolor Dango and light novels when I went to see her...
Yae Miko: Oh, the poor thing. Without desserts and books to console herself with, she was so angry she quite simply lost it. Crying and ranting and raving... Oh, I could hardly bear to see her that way...
Paimon: You expect us to believe that a god would throw a temper tantrum over something like that!?
Traveler: I don't believe you.
Yae Miko: Hehe. Before you get too indignant, consider the fact that your concerns sound every bit as nonsensical to me as that blatant lie did to you.
Yae Miko: Ei seeks eternity. To her, mortal lives come and go in the blink of an eye. Of what consequence to her are mortal concerns for her wellbeing?
Paimon: You're saying she's fine, right?
Yae Miko: I don't know the details. She said she wanted to rest, and I have nothing pressing that requires her attention. So there is no reason to disturb her.
Yae Miko: I have heard about the thunderstorm, though. As to the cause, it is not inconceivable that, as you suggest, her will has wavered somewhat.
Traveler: All the more reason to check on her.
Yae Miko: I am the only one in all of Inazuma who can visit her while she is resting.
Yae Miko: But tell me, why should this concern me? Why should I do this for you, when I already have everything one could ever want, and have seen everything one could ever wish to see?
Traveler: Do it for the people of Inazuma.
Yae Miko: Haha. I like that answer.
Yae Miko: Here is the Pass Permit. Show it to the Okuzumeshuu at the gate, and he will let you in.
Paimon: Thanks, Miko!
Yae Miko: My question was in jest, but since you answered it in earnest, please stay true to your word.
Yae Miko: Oh, and don't forget to return the Pass Permit to me after you have finished with it.
Traveler: Do it for Ei.
Traveler: Maybe she's gone stir-crazy.
Traveler: It's not beyond the realm of possibility.
Traveler: That's hard to believe...
Traveler: Actually, I wanted to ask you about something.
Yae Miko: Oh, how cold. I saved your skin, didn't I? Surely you could at least humor me by engaging in some small talk first?
Yae Miko: Then again, I suppose your frankness is part of your charm.

## Talk 4

Takeshi: The Almighty Shogun has requested solitude. No visitors allowed.
Paimon: We've got a Pass Permit from Miko.
Takeshi: Don't be ridiculous. Lady Guuji never gives her Pass Permit to another person, not even esteemed travelers like yourselves.
Takeshi: Guuji Yae is only authorized to hold that Pass Permit because of the trust that the Almighty Shogun places in her and her alone...
Takeshi: Wait... This is... authentic!?
Traveler: It'd be a little difficult to forge it.
Takeshi: Understood. Then, as the Shogun has ordered, I must not stand in your way.
Takeshi: Apologies, please proceed. Since the Shogun is resting at this time, please be especially respectful and make sure your behavior is impeccable.
Traveler: Feel free to check with Miko.

## Talk 5

Raiden Shogun: How did you get in?
Raiden Shogun: Trespassers are to be eliminated at once.
Paimon: Wait, no, it's us! Why are you treating us like we're your enemies!?
Paimon: We made amends, didn't we? Also, we got in by totally legitimate means!
Raiden Shogun: Denied. Use of force has been forbidden.
Raiden Shogun: Anyway. Be gone. Do not disturb my solitude.
Traveler: Forbidden? Why?
Raiden Shogun: That is of no concern. This is my recuperation state.
Paimon: #Huh, {NICKNAME}, what do you make of this? She's acting strange, huh?
Traveler: Do puppets really need rest and relaxation?
Raiden Shogun: This body has no need of rest. But I am an assistant to the one within. If she wishes to rest, I must follow her will.
Paimon: Paimon gets it. So this is all Ei's doing...
Paimon: But why? Surely you going about your business doesn't interfere with the Plane of Euthymia?
Paimon: She's got plenty of space in there. Seems like it would be the perfect place for rest and relaxation.
Raiden Shogun: I do as she wishes. I can say no more than this.
Traveler: Why not put their minds at rest?
Raiden Shogun: I cannot. In my current state, even if I went out, I could do nothing.
Raiden Shogun: I am currently unwilling to deal with any business. I am also incapable of it.
Paimon: Huh? What do you mean by that?
Raiden Shogun: ...
Raiden Shogun: It has been forbidden. *sigh* Please refrain from making me talk any further.
Paimon: #What should we do, {NICKNAME}? It feels like this conversation is going nowhere.
Traveler: Are you sick?
Ei: Ah, it's you two. It's been a while.
Ei: The Shogun can't do much at the moment. Come straight in and see me.
Traveler: Have you malfunctioned?
Traveler: Everyone's worried and wants to see you.
Traveler: Has she ever been like this before?
Traveler: Is everything okay?

## Talk 6

Paimon: That was terrifying! Would it be so hard to give us a little warning first...
Ei: It's not your first time. I don't see what there is to be so alarmed about.
Paimon: So, is the Shogun broken? Are you gonna get it fixed, or...?
Ei: Don't worry. The Shogun's not broken, I've just temporarily disabled many of her functions.
Ei: Currently, the Shogun is unable to handle any business and cannot appear as me. So the easiest solution was to announce that I am resting.
Traveler: That's what she meant by "forbidden"...
Ei: As I said, I need to think about Inazuma's Eternity. And thinking takes time.
Ei: But the Shogun is still running based on her old rules. I can't allow her to make any more mistakes while I am working things out.
Paimon: Have you tried turning it off and on again?
Ei: No. She was not created to ever be turned off.
Ei: Furthermore, I had even predicted at the time that I may wish to modify the Shogun's operational rules at some point in the future. However, such changes would not be conducive to Eternity.
Traveler: You are so strict with yourself...
Ei: That's why the Shogun has a robust system to safeguard against modification. It's also to protect against unforeseen circumstances.
Ei: For now, while I figure out the form that Eternity should take, it's more effective for me to temporarily disable some of the puppet's functions rather than attempt to modify her rules.
Paimon: Paimon gets it now. The thunderstorm's getting out of control because some of the Shogun's functions have been disabled.
Ei: The thunderstorm is getting out of control? This is the first I've heard of it.
Paimon: Huh? Okay, well, let us bring you up to speed...
Ei: Hmm, I see. So the thunderstorm is drawing closer...
Paimon: You can fix it... right?
Ei: It's just a minor error. This kind of thing was bound to happen. A small modification to the Shogun should fix it.
Traveler: ...So everyone was worked up over nothing.
Ei: Don't look at me like that. I've never had to tinker with the Shogun before, and she's very complicated. It's practically inevitable for something to go wrong when you start tweaking things.
Ei: Yes, that's it. I'm not making excuses. It's the truth.
Paimon: It's fine. Just as long as you can fix it is all.
Traveler: Any progress on your thoughts about Eternity?
Ei: Not much. As before, I can see the way forward, yet there are still contradictions.
Ei: But there is no urgency. To reach an ill-conceived verdict in haste, just for the sake of having reached one, would be a confusion of priorities.
Traveler: Come with us. Get a change of pace.
Ei: Hmm?
Paimon: If everyone sees that the Shogun is in good health, it'll put all the speculation and rumors out there to rest!
Paimon: And who knows, a change of scenery might put you in a different mood and give you some fresh inspiration!
Ei: You mean... leave the Plane of Euthymia?
Traveler: It might do everyone some good.
Ei: Yes, you're right. After all, the Shogun is currently unable to take care of business on my behalf.
Ei: Alright then. I'll come out for a while.
Ei: Since the theme of the day is a change of pace, you can just call me Ei. I'm not a great fan of rigid titles.
Paimon: What? But you're just Ei's consciousness, aren't you? Can consciousness actually leave this place?
Ei: I have my ways. I would never subject myself to imprisonment voluntarily.
Paimon: Great. Then there's nothing to worry about! Allow us to be your tour guides!
Ei: Tour guides? What's a tour guide?
Paimon: Someone to show you around the Inazuma of today and give you tips on where to eat and how to have fun! Alright, let's go go go!
Traveler: You haven't left in a long time, I'll bet?
Ei: It's unnecessary, as far as I'm concerned. But since you are inviting me... a change of pace might well be nice.
Traveler: How about we go for a walk?
Traveler: Seems a little arbitrary.
Traveler: So it was all your doing.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Thoma: Your master shouldn't blame himself so much. Anyone else in his position would find it just as difficult to deal with.
Ippei: Exactly. He puts far too much pressure on himself...
Ippei: *sigh*... The Kujou Clan's future isn't looking bright.

### Additional Talk 2

Yae Miko: She spends all her time alone. Having a visitor once in a while can't do any harm.
Yae Miko: As the one who shook Eternity, you are her potential for change.

### Additional Talk 3

Takeshi: It's rumored that the Almighty Shogun has taken ill... Could it be true?
Takeshi: Ah, ignore me. Please, head in.
