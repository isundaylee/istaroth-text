Traveler: How do you like it here?
Lyney: Your home is breathtaking! Even a legendary magician like myself can confidently say I've never seen or heard of anything like it!
Lyney: But were I to say I've already gotten completely used to it... Would you think I'm lying?
Traveler: Sure doesn't seem like the truth.
Lyney: Aw, that really hurts my feelings...
Lyney: But, I was really being honest this time!
Lyney: Well, looks like I've got no choice but to stay here for a while longer! After all, it will take some time for me to win your trust again.
Lyney: ...You won't kick me out, right?
Traveler: No, I trust you.
Lyney: Hehe, I'm honored to have gained your trust.
Lyney: It's almost impossible for me to lie to your face... Maybe it's because I can't bear to see that hurt expression of yours.
Lyney: Ahem, but back to the topic at hand! Since you care about me so much, surely you would also want me to extend my stay?
Lyney: In which case, I'll be looking forward to more of your hospitality!
