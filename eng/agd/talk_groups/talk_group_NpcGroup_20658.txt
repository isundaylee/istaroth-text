Lutong: #Oh, hello Traveler. Nice to see you.
Lutong: I hate to tell you this, and it's a real pity, but our trip to Petrichor will have to be postponed.
Traveler: Has something happened in Petrichor?
Lutong: Some... dangers, difficulties, an unforeseen situation... something like that.
Lutong: According to the Gardes, all the residents of Petrichor seem to have fallen into... a strange slumber.
Lutong: The Gardes suspect that it has something to do with some kind of natural hypnotic gas that's escaping from the ground beneath the city.
Lutong: For safety reasons, they are currently advising all travelers to stay away... us included, of course.
Lutong: Mr. Garcia is very worried about his friends who are still in town, and he's even considering slipping in unnoticed on his own.
Lutong: Fortunately, Ms. Kaia was very quick on her feet and managed to stop Mr. Garcia by tying him up amicably.
Traveler: Tying him up... amicably?
Lutong: We've provided him with a mattress to lie down on, and the restraints are made of fine satin. I'm sure that no harm will afflict him, except for his own guilty conscience.
Lutong: In any case, all we can do now is wait here in the Court of Fontaine. Thanks to the Gardes and the theater troupe members, those who would seek to lay their hands on Mr Garcia's research won't dare do anything rash.
Lutong: I'll let you know as soon as we're able to depart.
Traveler: Are you running low on travel funds?
Lutong: You're certainly not wrong, but our journey has been forestalled by a far greater problem.
