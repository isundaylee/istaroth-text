# Recollections of a Fontainian


## Talk 1

Augustus Lovelace: A-Achoo! The smell of these spices is just too... A-ACHOO!
Augustus Lovelace: I should just take a picture and go hide in my room...
Augustus Lovelace: Traveler! Hey! Traveler! Hold on a second!
Traveler: Who, me?
Augustus Lovelace: I'd like your help with taking a picture, just one. It won't take long.
Augustus Lovelace: *sigh* It's embarrassing to admit, but the aroma of the spices here is a little too strong for me...
Augustus Lovelace: During my time in Fontaine, I never had food with even just a hint of spiciness, a pinch of salt is as much as I can take.
Augustus Lovelace: Here, I'm sneezing so much that— ACHOO! I can't even hold the Kamera steadily...
Augustus Lovelace: So, all I can do... is ask someone else to take a photo for me.
Augustus Lovelace: You certainly seem to be a kind person, so... I'd like to ask for your help.
Traveler: You're from Fontaine?
Augustus Lovelace: Indeed. I'm very sorry that I forgot to introduce myself...
Augustus Lovelace: I'm Augustus Lovelace, a researcher from Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering.
Traveler: Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering?
Augustus Lovelace: It's a mouthful, isn't it? You can call it the Fontaine Research Institute, as most people in Fontaine do.
Augustus Lovelace: The Fontaine Research Institute used to be a paradise for researchers in Fontaine and where most mechanical creations originated.
Augustus Lovelace: But thanks to Mr. Edwin, most buildings in the Fontaine Research Institute are lying in ruin now...
Augustus Lovelace: And ever since Raimondo and Mr. Choiseul took over the reconstruction project, the spirit of research at the institute has been in freefall.
Augustus Lovelace: I have standards and prefer a tidy environment. I refuse to live in a pile of rubble, and so I've been traveling around.
Augustus Lovelace: Don't let my troubles spoil your mood, they have nothing to do with you.
Augustus Lovelace: Come on, please hurry and snap a photo for me. Once Xavier sees the beauty of Sumeru, there's no way he'll stay in Inazuma!
Traveler: About Xavier...
Augustus Lovelace: Xavier is a researcher from the Fontaine Research Institute. We used to work in the same laboratory, and he once gave me quite a bit of help.
Augustus Lovelace: He insisted on shooting a film and being the director. That wasn't a very popular idea in Fontaine Research Institute at the time.
Augustus Lovelace: Even after being assigned to other projects, he still continued shooting "dokumentari films" in the name of recording their research process.
Augustus Lovelace: Just like that, he went back and forth between projects and the laboratory until he was finally sent to Inazuma...
Augustus Lovelace: He's a very resourceful person. I'm certain that had he been born in the past, when funding was abundant and more fields of research were accepted, or been born in a brighter future, he would have accomplished great things...
Augustus Lovelace: That's enough of that. Come and take a photo of me. Right here will do.
Traveler: What kind of place is that?
Traveler: What can I do for you?

## Talk 2

Paimon: That should do it, let's show him the photo!

## Talk 3

Augustus Lovelace: Not bad indeed. You have a gift.
Augustus Lovelace: It's the first time in my travels that I've met someone with such control over composition and color.
Traveler: Where have your travels taken you?
Augustus Lovelace: Ah, that, well... I could have come directly to Sumeru from Fontaine... after all, there's a line going straight to the Bayda Harbor in Sumeru.
Augustus Lovelace: But as they say, it's about the journey, not the destination. So I chose a... more interesting route.
Augustus Lovelace: First, I went from Lumidouce Harbor to Chenyu Vale, and then passed through Qingce Village on my way to the Stone Gate that separates Mondstadt from Liyue.
Augustus Lovelace: After stopping by Dawn Winery, I decided to head south and visit Liyue Harbor.
Augustus Lovelace: I embarked on a ferry to Port Ormos from Liyue Harbor, traveled northward along the river, and here I am standing before you.
Augustus Lovelace: After all, my goal is to relax. Were I a brave warrior with a passion for adventure...
Augustus Lovelace: ...I might have decided to set out from Romaritime Harbor and followed the ancient path of the pilgrims, heading southward into the desert.
Augustus Lovelace: Who knows? Maybe I'll try to cross the desert on the way back. Anyway, I've still got extra Mora to spend, and paying a visit to Natlan on the other side of the desert sounds nice too...
Augustus Lovelace: Alright, I won't keep you any longer. Thank you for helping me with the photo, please accept this as a token of my gratitude.
Augustus Lovelace: I'm off to write to Xavier. If he still won't come to Sumeru, then I might as well go back to Fontaine...

Traveler: I've worked with Xavier...
Augustus Lovelace: You... Whoa! Are you the Traveler that Xavier told me about?
Augustus Lovelace: A pleasure! It's truly an honor to meet you! I've read all about your heroic feats in the Mikage Furnace from Xavier's letters.
Augustus Lovelace: And whenever Xavier talks about films in his letters, he always mentions your extraordinary acting skills!
Augustus Lovelace: He says you're fearless, noble, and most importantly, you have a great sense of humor!
Augustus Lovelace: Oh, once you've taken the photo, you must give me your autograph. It would be perfect if you signed the photo!
Traveler: How is Xavier doing these days?
Augustus Lovelace: Well, to be honest... not great. He's anxious about his film, and based on his letters, he has been having trouble finding an interesting new subject lately.
Augustus Lovelace: I suggested that he should do as I did and take some time off in Sumeru.
Augustus Lovelace: But he keeps insisting that he must shoot the best possible film for the Yashiro Commission, and he refuses to leave Inazuma until it's done.
Augustus Lovelace: That's enough of that. Come and take a photo of me. Right here will do.
Traveler: How did you get to know Xavier?
Augustus Lovelace: As you must be well aware, Xavier is a researcher from the Fontaine Research Institute. We used to work in the same laboratory, and he once gave me quite a bit of help.
