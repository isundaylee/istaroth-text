# Fishing For Jade


## Talk 1

Kun: A perfectly good Jade Chamber... Gone, just like that...

## Talk 2

Kun: Have you finished the cleanup?
Traveler: I found these things...
Kun: Hmm... I suppose you can just keep that Mora. It isn't much, so I suppose you can keep it as compensation for your help.
Kun: This box, on the other hand, is unknown to me. You might want to pass it on to Baiwen.
Kun: She's currently attending to some business at Yuehai Pavilion. Perhaps she might know what it is.

## Talk 3

Baiwen: Hello, how may I help you?
Traveler: I picked this up from the sea...
Baiwen: Hmm? Allow me to have a look.
Baiwen: Yes, this does indeed come from the Jade Chamber.
Traveler: Anything specific you could tell me?
Baiwen: Well, the contents consist of several documents and an announcement that has yet to undergo review. To think that they are still so well-preserved... How unexpected.
Baiwen: Still, your find should save us some work. Cleaning up after this mess really has proved an unending font of busywork.
Baiwen: Still, thank you for bringing these to us. Do take this as a token of our appreciation.
