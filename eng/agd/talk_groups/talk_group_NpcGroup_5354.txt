Traveler: What are you doing?
Bossuet: Oh, right. I'm working on tonight's menu. After much contemplation, I decided on fish for the main dish, to go with a few special drinks...
Bossuet: I'm sure those gentlemen will be pleased.
Bossuet: Thanks to the God King's grace, the spices I ordered finally arrived on time, and combined with some fish fresh from the ocean...
Bossuet: Well, feel free to stay and have a taste! Trust me, fish are my specialty!

## Talk 3

Traveler: You want to make a cannon?
Bossuet: Me? No, no, this cannon was designed by Mécantre and Babisse. I just had some... peripheral participation in the discussions.
Bossuet: Even though the design philosophy and purpose of this cannon are intriguing to say the least, I must say that this line of thinking is quite... well, overboard.
Bossuet: A "daydream" in all senses of the word.
Bossuet: Putting aside the cannon material and the shape of the projectile it must fire, immense amounts of propellant must be expended to fire any shell up to the altitude they desire...
Bossuet: Hehe, the fuel they'd need could stuff four or five cannons of this caliber to the brim.
Bossuet: ...That said, I reckon it's not a bad thing that their research continues. My guidance may yet ensure that their work bears fruit that will be useful in other fields...

## Talk 4

Traveler: And you are...?
Bossuet: Hmm? You've not heard of me? Well, I suppose you don't look like researchers on the cutting edge either.
Bossuet: Bossuet's the name. I once worked at the Fontaine Research Institute.
Bossuet: If you have time to visit the Institute, I'm sure you'll find many an academic achievement credited to me, and researchers who have received my mentorship.
Bossuet: Ah, but that said, I'm not providing professional guidance at the moment.
Bossuet: I've retired from my research post, and am here in peaceful retirement. If you wanted professional aid, I fear I must disappoint you.

## Talk 5

Traveler: And you are...?
Bossuet: You don't know of me? Or rather, you don't recognize me? Oh, wonderful. Raimondo and Choiseul's plan to erase me from the Institute has gone swimmingly. How happy I am for them.
Bossuet: Pleased to make your acquaintance, Honorary Senior Researcher. I am Bossuet, and I once worked at the Fontaine Research Institute.
Bossuet: I believe you might have found many a fruit of my academic labor in the Institute, and met some of my mentees to boot. Your fame has reached me here, thanks to the trusty Steambird.
Bossuet: Oh, by the way, I've resigned from my post as a researcher, and I'm here in quiet retirement. Not taking mentorships at the moment.
Bossuet: So if that's what you were looking for, you're going to be disappointed, I fear.

## Talk 6

Traveler: ...Goodbye.
Bossuet: See you. Take care now.

## Talk 7
