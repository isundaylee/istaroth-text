# Price Comparison


## Talk 1

Rama: Made up your mind yet? Want to place your order with me?
Traveler: I'd like to place my order here.
Rama: Thanks for your patronage! Please wait a moment while I make preparations and arrange delivery.
Traveler: I'll try my luck elsewhere.
Rama: Alright. But hurry up, please. If you wait too long, I may be out of stock.

## Talk 2

Azalai: I'll have to ask Raef to find someone...
Traveler: Why the long face?
Azalai: What are you looking to buy, Traveler? I'm afraid that we may be somewhat out of stock.
Traveler: So that's what troubles you?
Azalai: Yes... This is a desert village, so shipment has always been troublesome for us.
Azalai: Whenever I want to source some wares, I need to ask those who happen to leave the village to place an order for me, then transport it to the village together with Raef.
Azalai: One way or another, my business costs are slowly rising. To make ends meet, I have no other choice than to increase my prices.
Azalai: Thankfully, the people of this village understand my predicament and are willing to support my business, otherwise... I would've gone bankrupt a long time ago.
Azalai: But, alas... I can't find anyone who's planning to leave the village, and Raef and his crew aren't always available...
Azalai: If I'm unlucky, some low-volume goods may be out of stock soon...
Traveler: And those goods are...
Azalai: They are all daily essentials. Even though I'm usually quick to source them, they sell even quicker.
Azalai: I'm running a small business, so I can't always buy large volumes.
Azalai: Ahem... that's a topic for another day. Traveler, perhaps you are getting ready to leave the village?
Azalai: I've been wanting to source some spices and need someone to place an order for me... Could you assist me with this?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Azalai: Let me see... <color=#00E1FFFF>Rama's</color> spices are fairly priced and the quality is... serviceable.
Azalai: <color=#00E1FFFF>Jut</color> has recently got his hands on some novelty spices — the quality's quite promising. I'd like to give them a shot, just to see if there's any demand, but I'm not sure about the price point...
Azalai: But my budget for this purchase is limited, so deciding which supplier to choose isn't going to be easy...
Azalai: Traveler, please check out both suppliers and pick one to place an order with.
Azalai: Oh, one more thing. Whenever I commissioned someone to place an order for me in the past, I'd ask them to look for a relatively cheap price point.
Azalai: I'd like you to do the same. Please remember to look for the cheaper supplier.
Azalai: The business strategy that's been working in Aaru Village so far is "selling more at a lower profit margin."
Traveler: I'll check out what <color=#00E1FFFF>Rama</color> has to offer first...
Azalai: Thank you in advance. I'll mark her location on the map for you.
Azalai: Alright, come back anytime if you have any additional questions.
Traveler: I'll check out what <color=#00E1FFFF>Jut</color> has to offer first...
Azalai: Thank you in advance. I'll mark his location on the map for you.
Traveler: So spices are out of stock in your store?
Azalai: I wouldn't say we've run out completely... but given how big the sales volumes are, it's always better to have some more in stock.
Traveler: If only you could find a long-term business partner...
Azalai: It's not like I haven't considered that, but look around you.
Azalai: Shipping goods into the village and running business here aren't exactly easy.

## Talk 3

Azalai: How did it go? Have you placed an order yet?
Traveler: About <color=#00E1FFFF>Rama's</color> location...
Azalai: You can't find her exact location? Okay... I'll mark that spot on the map for you.
Azalai: You should be good to go now. I'm counting on you, Traveler.
Traveler: About <color=#00E1FFFF>Jut's</color> location...
Azalai: You can't find his exact location? Okay... I'll mark that spot on the map for you.

## Talk 4

Azalai: I'll have to ask Raef to find someone...

Azalai: I'm running a small business, so I can't always buy large volumes.
Azalai: Ahem... that's a topic for another day. Traveler, perhaps you are getting ready to leave the village?
Azalai: I've been wanting to source some Dried Fish and need someone to place an order for me... Could you assist me with this?
Traveler: Leave it to me.
Azalai: Let me see... <color=#00E1FFFF>Butrus'</color> Dried Fish are fairly priced and the taste is... acceptable.
Azalai: <color=#00E1FFFF>Jahangir</color> has been using a new Dried Fish recipe recently — people say that the flavor is really good thanks to all the spices.
Azalai: I'd like to give them a shot, just to see if there's any demand, but I'm not sure about the price point...
Azalai: But my budget for this purchase is limited, so deciding which supplier to choose isn't going to be easy...

Azalai: Thank you in advance. I'll mark his location on the map for you.
Azalai: Alright, come back anytime if you have any additional questions.
Traveler: I'll check out what <color=#00E1FFFF>Jahangir</color> has to offer first...
Traveler: I thought everyone would dry fish on their own...
Azalai: Hahaha... Trust me, Traveler. Drying fish out in the desert is not a good idea...
Traveler: If only you could find a long-term business partner...
Azalai: It's not like I haven't considered that, but look around you.
Azalai: Shipping goods into the village and running business here aren't exactly easy.

## Talk 5

Azalai: How did it go? Have you placed an order yet?
Traveler: About <color=#00E1FFFF>Butrus'</color> location...
Azalai: You can't find his exact location? Okay... I'll mark that spot on the map for you.
Azalai: You should be good to go now. I'm counting on you, Traveler.
Traveler: About <color=#00E1FFFF>Jahangir's</color> location...

## Talk 6

Jahangir: Hey, have you decided yet? One word and I'll start prepping everything.
Traveler: I'd like to place my order here.
Jahangir: Okay! I'll send one of my employees to deliver the order when I'm done making Dried Fish.
Traveler: I—I'm going to look elsewhere...
Jahangir: Huh? Didn't I say you wouldn't find such tasty Dried Fish elsewhere? There's not much to think about...

## Talk 7

Black Screen Text: You bring Azalai up to speed on sourcing goods...
Azalai: Hm... Ordered from Rama's? Should be alright.
Azalai: Her spices are both cheap and of good quality, very popular with the people of this village. Once they arrive, selling them shouldn't be a problem.
Azalai: Thanks for your help, Traveler. This is your remuneration. And this Mora, please take it along, too.
Azalai: That miser Rama though... I've ordered so many times from her, and she never gave me a discount.

## Talk 8

Rama: Welcome! Want to buy some spices? We have all the usuals, and all at affordable prices!
Traveler: About Azalai's order...
Rama: Huh? Azalai asked you to place an order for him? No problem at all...
Rama: It's just that he used to ask the Eremites to source his goods, and this time, he commissioned an Adventurer...
Rama: Ahem! What's his budget today? Let's see... Ooh, quite a bit.
Rama: Uh, if you place an order at my store, the spices supplied by me should last him for a long while.
Rama: As for the selling price... Just like before, I suggest setting a slightly lower price point. That's an easy way to boost sales.
Traveler: I'd like to place my order here.
Rama: Oh! Thanks for your patronage! Please wait a moment while I make preparations and arrange delivery.
Traveler: I'll try my luck elsewhere.
Rama: Okay... Come back and tell me if you change your mind.

## Talk 9

Black Screen Text: You bring Azalai up to speed on sourcing goods...
Azalai: Purchased from Jahangir? The price is... *gasp* How can it be so pricey? What spices does he use? Mora itself?
Azalai: It's nothing I can't handle. Worst case scenario, I'll cut the Dried Fish up and sell it that way.
Azalai: Ah... Um, here is your payment, Traveler. Thank you for your help.
Azalai: How many pieces can these be cut into?

## Talk 10

Butrus: Welcome! Are you looking for fish? Then you've come to the right place! There are no fish fresher than mine. Ask that cat over there if you don't believe me.
Traveler: About Azalai's order...
Butrus: Huh... Azalai is looking to source some Dried Fish from me? No worries.
Butrus: This amount of Mora is enough to buy a large quantity of Dried Fish. It should last him for a while.
Butrus: Though my Dried Fish is... well... faithful to the original flavor! No spices or anything like that.
Traveler: I'd like to place my order here.
Butrus: Alright! Hehe... I'll go pick out some Dried Fish and get someone to deliver his order to him in a bit.
Traveler: I'll try my luck elsewhere.
Butrus: Huh? Fine... Go ahead and compare prices.
Butrus: But I can't really afford to give you another discount. I won't make any profit otherwise.

## Talk 11

Butrus: What say you? Want to order Dried Fish from me?
Traveler: I'd like to place my order here.
Butrus: Alright! Hehe... I'll go pick out some Dried Fish and get someone to deliver his order to him in a bit.
Traveler: I'll try my luck elsewhere.
Butrus: Don't be too long or there won't be any Dried Fish left.

## Talk 12

Jut: Hi, are you shopping for spices?
Traveler: About Azalai's order...
Jut: For this amount... He won't be able to buy much. However, my spices are worth a lot of Mora.
Jut: Well... Since it's his order, I'll add my two cents. As a friend, I don't really recommend him to buy from me.
Jut: From what I gathered about business in Aaru Village... I'd say that "selling more at a lower price point" is the way to go.
Jut: Simply put, it's about selling goods of passable quality for a relatively low price, and selling large quantities fast as a way to make a quick return on the invested capital.
Jut: Conversely, if he tries to sell expensive high-quality goods in Aaru Village, the return will be slow.
Jut: But this is just my opinion. It's up to him what kind of goods he decides to sell.
Traveler: I'd like to order from you.
Jut: Alright. I'll go prepare the goods then.
Traveler: I'll try my luck elsewhere.
Jut: All good. If you still want to order from me, feel free to come back anytime.

## Talk 13

Jut: How's it going? Made up your mind yet?
Traveler: I'd like to order from you.
Jut: Alright. I'll go prepare the goods then.
Traveler: I'll try my luck elsewhere.
Jut: I understand. We're talking about no small sums. Careful consideration is highly advised, indeed.

## Talk 14

Black Screen Text: You bring Azalai up to speed on sourcing goods...
Azalai: Ordered from Jut's? Are the prices high? Well, I'll have to raise my price point to match the cost then.
Azalai: But these spices seem to be of very high quality. I should not worry about selling them...
Azalai: By the way, Traveler, this is your remuneration.

## Talk 15

Black Screen Text: You bring Azalai up to speed on sourcing goods...
Azalai: I see, the quality of Butrus' Dried Fish is always reliable, and the quantity... not bad at all.
Azalai: When the goods arrive, I'll have to send some to doctor Maruf as thanks for treating my leg injury last time.
Azalai: There's also Raef and Fodil, they helped me unload cargo...
Azalai: Ahem! Thanks for your help, Traveler. This is your remuneration. And this Mora, please take it along, too.
Azalai: Fortunately, you ordered from Butrus. Giving some Dried Fish away shouldn't be a problem considering the order quantity.

## Talk 16

Jahangir: Welcome! Would you like to have a bite? Everything's freshly made.
Traveler: About Azalai's order...
Jahangir: Ahaha, sure! I told him my Dried Fish is famous far and wide and will definitely sell for a good price.
Jahangir: This amount of Mora will get you some Dried Fish. Just say the word and I'll make a fresh batch for you.
Traveler: You'll start drying it now?
Jahangir: Of course not! What I meant was going to my warehouse to take the Dried Fish out and seasoning them to elevate their flavor profile.
Jahangir: Wait a minute... With the cost considered, you won't be able to buy that much Dried Fish after all.
Traveler: I'd like to place my order here.
Jahangir: Okay! I'll send one of my employees to deliver the order when I'm done making Dried Fish.
Traveler: I—I'm going to look elsewhere...
Jahangir: Huh? No need to rush, the price is negotiable. Besides, you won't find such tasty Dried Fish anywhere else!

## Talk 17

Azalai: How's it going, Traveler? Did you place the order for me?
Traveler: I did.
