Bulletin Board (Message): "And now that we have access to the Akasha, these amateur Mahamata are not even at my level."

Bulletin Board (Message): "Last month, I sailed to a country whose king had never seen a horse. Can you believe it?"
Bulletin Board (Message): "So I decided to sell some Sumpter Beasts there and tell them that those were horses, haha. If I closed a deal with them, perhaps I could be a king or something there!"
Bulletin Board (Another Person's Message): "What is a king?"
Bulletin Board (Message): "Like the Navbed or a Vizier, but with greater power than any of them. Pretty much the same as the legendary Twenty-Nine Deys. Gosh, it's so hard to describe."

Bulletin Board (Message): "But, of course, if you want to watch a dancing performance, you still have to go to Zubayr Theater, though."

Bulletin Board (Message): "What's that? Can't hear you!"

## Talk 17

Bulletin Board (Message): "This is embarrassing to say. We were workers that maintain merchant ships here, living off the maintenance skills passed down from generation to generation."
Bulletin Board (Message): "But some time ago, new technologies have been added to the Akasha, and our years of experience have become worthless. Young people can still learn through the Akasha, but old stuff like us have no choice but to change jobs."
Bulletin Board (Message): "The Scribe said we can go to sea and try our luck, but we have no money for something like that right now. If you have any gigs, please come to us."
Bulletin Board (Another Person's Message): "Don't listen to the Scribe. I happen to know a big client who needs craftsmen. I'll introduce you to her. Take the money too. Forget about going to sea."
Bulletin Board (Reply): "I wish you could do less meaningless things. Some people will succeed and some will fall, that's how the world works. Why interfere with it just to act like a goody-two-shoes?"
Bulletin Board (Another Person's Message): "Here the Scribe goes again with the mysticism. Why did I do this, you say? Because it makes me happy!"
Bulletin Board (Another Person's Message): "And don't you forget that mutual assistance, fairness, and righteous anger are also what drive the world, not the nonsense like 'the fittest survives'!"
Bulletin Board (Reply): "Make no mistake. I have never denied what you meant, but you don't understand what I am saying to you at all. End of conversation."
Bulletin Board (Reply): "It's a headache to argue with the impulsive. Anyway, where's your own budget? Don't tell me you're spending all your Akademiya subsidies on such nonsense."
Bulletin Board (Another Person's Message): "'The poor suffer from the rich's wealth. Thus the rich should give away their wealth for a good purpose.' says the sage Zolfikar."
Bulletin Board (Reply): "He never said that."
Bulletin Board (Another Person's Message): "He did."
Bulletin Board (Reply): "No, he never said that. And you'll pay for your drinks this month."
Bulletin Board (Another Person's Message): "I won't argue with you about this. But give me a month. I'll prove that he said it."

## Talk 18

Bulletin Board (Trading Company Advertisement): "Our company has opened the route to Dornman Port. We sincerely invite you to join our fruit business."
Bulletin Board (Message): "Wait a minute. Is it even possible to import fruit from Mondstadt, given the long voyage? I might be interested if you were talking about liquor."
Bulletin Board (Reply): "Everyone knows importing wine from Mondstadt is a business, but importing fruit? Only I do such business here. That's why this is such a great business opportunity!"
Bulletin Board (Reply): "And you don't actually need to import from Mondstadt..."
