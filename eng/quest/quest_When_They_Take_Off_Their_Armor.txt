# When They Take Off Their Armor


## Talk 1

Kaeya: Well, well. This is a surprise. I didn't expect to see you two behind the counter today.
Kaeya: In that case, I'd like a Death After Noon...
Rosaria: Leave it to Kaeya to make things difficult right from the start...
Kaeya: #Come now, I just wanted to see how {F#she'd}{M#he'd} react. I admit I didn't expect to see you here today, Sister Rosaria.
Kaeya: With so many demanding customers that frequent the tavern, I only thought I'd help the Traveler gain some experience.
Paimon: There he goes with that smooth talk again!
Kaeya: Don't get me wrong, I was only trying to be helpful! If anything, you should be thanking me. Now, how about we start with something simple like a Moonlit Alley, for instance.
Kaeya: Oh, and make it a large, please.
Rosaria: I'll leave my drink up to you. Just make it a tea of some kind, and not too big.
Traveler: Got it. Coming right up.
Kaeya: Please, take your time. Waiting in anticipation is half the fun.

## Talk 2

Rosaria: Hmm...
Paimon: What is it, Rosaria? You don't like the drink?
Traveler: I can make you another one...
Rosaria: No, the drink you made me is fine. It's just that I rarely ever drink tea. The taste always reminds me of certain... things.
Kaeya: Ah, I presume you're referring to the church?
Rosaria: Yes. The church once held an event that I couldn't attend, but Sister Barbara still saved some tea and dessert for me...
Rosaria: The dessert had already gone stale, so she whisked it away when I wasn't looking, but the tea tasted just like this drink you made me.
Paimon: Boy, you're in rare form today, Rosaria.
Kaeya: Sounds to me like Mondstadt's just gained another black tea lover.
Rosaria: Heh, I'd prefer something a little stiffer.
Traveler: What about you, Kaeya? How's your drink?
Kaeya: That depends. If I point out a few flaws, will you make me another one?
Kaeya: Hahaha, I'm just kidding. I'd never subject you to such treatment.
Paimon: Gosh, Kaeya sure is a tough nut to crack, you never know what he'll say next. How can you stand to drink with this guy, Rosaria?
Rosaria: Hmm? I don't really care what's going through his mind, as long as we only talk about drinks.
Rosaria: Besides, Kaeya's only interested in people or things that intrigue him, whether that's you, the innkeeper here, or anybody else...
Kaeya: Hey! How could you divulge so much about your dear old drinking buddy, hmm?
Rosaria: You think I'm saying too much? Heh, get over yourself, it's no big deal.
Rosaria: Ugh, I'm constantly surrounded by uptight folks day-to-day. I prefer the easygoing atmosphere in the tavern.
Kaeya: Ooh, are we gossiping about people who take themselves too seriously, now?
Kaeya: Speaking of which, I know someone who could easily place in the "Top Three Most Serious People in Mondstadt."
Kaeya: As to their level of seriousness... Well, let me put it this way, they probably wouldn't even flinch if I said that to their face.
Paimon: Are there really rankings for people like that?
Kaeya: Of course. Just off the top of my head, there's a running list for the most consistent drinkers, hardest workers, worst cooks, or even... biggest hoarders of dark secrets.
Paimon: Sounds to Paimon like Mondstadters have way too much time on their hands!
Rosaria: Are there really that many people who don't need to work?
Traveler: No...
Paimon: #Aww, but what about Paimon? Is there a category that Paimon can be ranked as high as {F#her}{M#him}?
Kaeya: Why, of course. How about, "Best Bartenders"?
Paimon: Râ€”Really!?
Paimon: #That's great, {NICKNAME}! Our names will be remembered together forever!
Rosaria: Heh...
Rosaria: Well, I must admit, the atmosphere you bring isn't half bad.
Kaeya: You can say that again. Just looking at these two brings a smile to my face.
Kaeya: Good bartenders create a nice atmosphere and get people in a good mood. You know, like a mascot... so I guess there's really no contest for the title of "Best Bartenders."
Paimon: Huh?
Kaeya: Heh, nothing. Thanks for your hospitality.
Rosaria: Yeah, I should be going, too.
Rosaria: By the way, that black tea tasted great. I'll try to make some for myself in the future... if I can manage to get up early enough in the morning, that is.
Kaeya: Until next time.
Traveler: Please come again.
Traveler: I think I know who he's talking about...
