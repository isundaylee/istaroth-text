# Qimen Arts and the Rite of Homa, the Spirits are Calmed and Life Restored


## Talk 1

Xiao: #Hmm? Traveler, Paimon. How are you feeling after your trip to the border?
Paimon: We're feeling great, thanks! We just heard you were taking part in this Seven-and-Eight-Gates Method, so we came to see if there were any issues.
Traveler: About the Gate of Terrain...
Xiao: No need to worry. Though the Gate of Terrain symbolizes fire and volatility, it also stands for light, growth, and prosperity. For that reason, it is seen as a somewhat auspicious gate.
Xiao: The greatest challenge of tonight will be found not here, but at Hu Tao's Gate of Death.
Xiao: I will do my utmost to alleviate her burden.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Today's the day Ningguang said to meet up again. Let's head to Yujing Terrace!

## Talk 3

Hu Tao: We should head to Bubu Pharmacy first, or I won't catch them before they head out for Qingce Village.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Where to next?
Hu Tao: To pay a visit to Yun Jin!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Where should we go next?
Hu Tao: #I'll bet Traveler's guessed it already. Hehe, to Wanmin Restaurant we go.

## Talk 6

Paimon: Alright, we've been to three places already... Is there anyone else you wanna give a coin to?
Hu Tao: But of course! Surely you didn't think I'd forgotten about you?
Paimon: Whoa! You got some for us, too?
Hu Tao: Obviously! Come on, let's head to Wangsheng Funeral Parlor first.

## Talk 7

Paimon: It's already dark out... Should we go and head to the stage?

## Talk 8

Traveler: (If I can't connect to the Ley Lines, I can't be obfuscated by them either.)
Traveler: (That means I can take Hu Tao's place in the array and no one has to get sacrificed. As long as I can find her, that is...)

## Talk 9

Traveler: (She's not here... But these are her things...)

## Talk 10

Yelan: Oh? Fancy seeing you here. Don't you have business with Director Hu to attend to?
Paimon: Whoa, you really gather intel like it's going out of fashion... But anyway — we heard you were taking part in this Seven-and-Eight-Gates Method, so we came to check-in.
Traveler: About the Gate of Injury...
Yelan: It's piqued your curiosity, huh? Well, this is one of the least fun gates there is. The Gate of Injury symbolizes wounds and loss. It's one of the three gates of great misfortune, along with the Gates of Death and Fright.
Yelan: A long, long time ago, this was actually the home of the present-day people of Chenyu Vale.
Yelan: But as you know, there was a huge disaster here. My ancestors fought alongside the Yakshas, and gave their lives to save Liyue from peril.
Yelan: That's why it has to be me here, guarding this gate. Unless you've got other burning questions, I must ask you to leave at once.
Yelan: I'm sure you still remember the time we explored the depths of this place together... And I trust you haven't forgotten just how dangerous it was?

## Talk 11

Xiangling (Distant Voice): Promise you won't stand us up this time?
Xiangling (Distant Voice): #Okay, I can get behind that... If you're a no-show, I'm sending Traveler to track you down and drag you back to the dinner table kicking and screaming!

## Talk 12

Ganyu: Hey there you two... I wasn't expecting your company here at Mt. Aocang.
Paimon: We heard you were taking part in this Seven-and-Eight-Gates Method, so we came to see how you were doing.
Traveler: About the Gate of Concealment...
Ganyu: Don't worry. This Gate is a place of refuge, peace, and good fortune. It's the perfect place for Master and the other adepti to live in seclusion. I believe they're currently discussing something in Master's abode.
Ganyu: Once this crisis is over, you'd be more than welcome to come and stay here for a little while. It'd be good for your health.

## Talk 13

Zhongli (Distant Voice): Nevertheless, I would urge caution. Focus on the task at hand, not what transpired in the past. And do not forget the rest of that saying: "Follow your heart, and do what you can."

## Talk 14

Yun Jin: Good luck. I'll be waiting for you.

## Talk 15

Beidou: Hey! How'd you end up stranded out here? Ningguang didn't actually rope you into this too, did she?
Paimon: We heard you were taking part in this Seven-and-Eight-Gates Method, so we came to see how it's going.
Traveler: About the Gate of Fright...
Beidou: Ah, so you already know what's what.
Beidou: Since ancient times, the Gate of Fright has been known as a gate of great misfortune. It usually shows up in places filled with fear and desolation.
Beidou: I guess this place checks all the boxes, with all the demons Rex Lapis suppressed here.
Beidou: But the Crux Fleet is right at home in places like this, hahaha.
Beidou: If I didn't have to work tonight, I'd have loved to take you on a walk around the area.

## Talk 16

Hu Tao: Grandpa... and Dad. Are you here to take me to the other side?
Hu Tao: How'd I do as director, huh? Did I do the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor proud?
Father: Absolutely. You did a million times better than me.
Grandfather: Our little girl is the best.
Hu Tao: Good. Then... I can join you with no regrets...
Father: We're proud of you, little lady. But we only came to see you because we've missed you.
Hu Tao: I've missed you, too... But are you saying... you're not here to bring me into the afterlife?
Grandfather: Live in life, and die in death.... My child, your time has not yet come.
Father: Yes... The day of reunion will come in good time. There is no need to rush.
Grandfather: Look. Someone's here to take you home.

## Talk 17

Baizhu: We are grateful for Director Hu's well wishes. Don't worry about us — focus on your own duties.
Qiqi: Good luck, Hu Tao...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Xiangling: Hope everything goes smoothly. And don't leave me hanging this time!

### Additional Talk 2

Black Screen Text: After leaving Yujing Terrace, you spend some time staring at the Hu Tao rattan figure in your hands in dejected silence.
Black Screen Text: Before you know it, you've ended up in front of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor again.

### Additional Talk 3

Yanfei: Hurry! The Lantern Rite celebrations are about to begin! You don't want to miss Ms. Yun's opening show!
Yaoyao: Slow down, Yanfei! Otherwise, you're going to fall!
Xiangling: There are so many people... I hope everything goes smoothly on Hu Tao's end, so she can get back here and celebrate with us soon.
Yun Jin: Xinyan, over here! Hu Tao asked me to give you this fortune coin.
Xinyan: Wow, she got this for me? So... where did she go?
Lan Yan: Lady Tianquan, the Gate of Initiation is now ready. We are good to go.
Ningguang: Thank you. It won't be long now...
Ningguang: Director Hu... Good luck to us both.

### Additional Talk 4

Traveler: (She's not here... But these are her things...)
Traveler: (Check the Staff of Homa)
Traveler (Staff of Homa): (The flaming staff lies quietly on the ground, as if aware that its owner has left the world.)
Traveler: (Check the burnt Homa Altar)
Traveler (Homa Altar): (The fire in the altar has almost gone out. But some stray sparks flicker and frolic within the ashes... in true Hu Tao fashion.)
Traveler: (Check the broken rattan figure)
Traveler (Rattan Figure): (Do you remember who the rattan figure was made for? I'm sure you do.)
Traveler: (*Check the fissures on the tree*)
Traveler (Tree Shaped Like "Tao Dou"): (That crooked tree at the center of the border looks just like this year's Mingxiao lantern. There are some cracks in the middle of the trunk... they seem to lead to somewhere far away.)
Traveler: (Examine the fissures)
Traveler (Tree Shaped Like "Tao Dou"): (Something just flew out of your backpack...)

### Additional Talk 5

Black Screen Text: You wake up two days later in the back room of Bubu Pharmacy.
Paimon: You're finally awake! How do you feel? Does anything hurt?
Traveler: What happened...?
Paimon: You've been asleep for two whole days! If Baizhu hadn't insisted that you were just out from exhaustion, Paimon would've been worried sick!
Paimon: Still, it is a relief to see you finally wake up again. Guess Baizhu knew what he was talking about.
Traveler: When did I get here?
Paimon: The night of Lantern Rite, of course! Hu Tao carried you here on her back. Paimon was so worried to see you unconscious... Thankfully, Zhongli was there too, and he said you'd be fine.
Paimon: That being said... Why did you sneak off without saying a word? Were you trying to beat Hu Tao's record for running away and getting stranded in the border?
Traveler: It was an emergency.
Paimon: Yeah, yeah, Paimon knows. Hu Tao told us the whole story. Sounds like you did something pretty amazing!
Paimon: You've had a lot of visitors over the last couple of days. Zhongli, Ningguang, Lan Yan... and pretty much everyone else you could think of!
Traveler: Are they still here?
Paimon: Most of them have probably left by now, but Hu Tao's still waiting out in the main room. She's been there the whole time.
Paimon: Anyway, you stay in bed and get some rest! Paimon will go get Baizhu to take a look at you.

### Additional Talk 6

Black Screen Text: As you walk out of Bubu Pharmacy's back room, you are greeted by the peaceful and festive view of Liyue Harbor. A sense of relief washes over you.
Black Screen Text: Just then, you feel something cool against your face... You've been ambushed again.
Hu Tao (???): One more time, guess whooo~?
Traveler: I recognize those dulcet tones anywhere, Zhongli.
Hu Tao: Good! If you have the energy to joke around, it means you're making a good recovery!
Hu Tao: I'm so glad! Looks like I can stop worrying now... Welcome back, my hero!
Traveler: You are the real hero.
Hu Tao: Hahaha, don't be silly. It's just the two of us here, you really want to talk in glib pleasantries? 'Cause I can out-glib you any day of the week if that's how you wanna do this.
Traveler: Alright, um... So, how are you holding up?
Hu Tao: I'm doing great, thanks to a certain someone! Baizhu gave me a checkup too.
Hu Tao: You look remarkably well too, considering what you went through. But are you sure you're well enough to leave yet? You'll only make things worse if you power through before you've fully healed.
Traveler: I'll be fine.
Hu Tao: Well, I sure hope so... You know, I was really surprised you came to rescue me. You took such a huge risk... When did you become so reckless?
Traveler: I learned from the best, Director Hu...
Hu Tao: Hmph... Hey, look! Liyue Harbor looks so pretty from this angle... Let's see, what's everyone doing at this hour?
Hu Tao: Hmm... Those two kids look like they're in a hurry... I bet they're racing each other to the fortune coins.
Hu Tao: And that lady over there — her cheeks are so red, you'd think she's caught the sun... Aha, yes! She must be waiting for her lover so they can go set off some fireworks together!
Hu Tao: Such a marvelous view. Really puts me in a poetic mood! Hee-hee, okay, I got something:
Hu Tao: As fresh festivities fill the streets, while lanterns light the sky like countless times before...
Hu Tao: I dwell not on the twists and turns of bygone years, but remember this: that with each new day, I receive the gift of life once more.
Hu Tao: #Thank you, Traveler. Happy Lantern Rite.
Traveler: Happy Lantern Rite, Director Hu.
Hu Tao: Good! You still recognize me. So the fetor didn't fry your brain.

### Additional Talk 7

Lan Yan: #See you shortly, Traveler. We'll be waiting!
Traveler: About the eight gates...
Lan Yan: Oh? You want to learn more about the gates? Well, as you heard earlier, the gates are basically eight key nodes in Liyue's Ley Line network.
Lan Yan: You must be wondering why the Ministry of Civil Affairs had to do so much work to find out the locations of the gates?
Lan Yan: Well, the Qimen arts teach that the state of the Ley Lines is intricately linked to human activity. Each can affect the other.
Lan Yan: In other words, the gates' locations are subject to change over time.
Lan Yan: For instance, before our ancestors moved to Chenyu Vale, they lived near the Chasm. My grandpa says that back then, the gate there was the Gate of Life — yet all these years on, it's become the Gate of Injury.
Lan Yan: So we had to map out the gates all over again to make sure we're deploying the array properly.

### Additional Talk 8

Ningguang: Don't forget to come back here after Director Hu is done with you. There's a favor I would like to ask of you.
Traveler: About the people assigned to the eight gates...
Ningguang: Heh, you want to drop by and say hello to them? Well, you'd better hurry if you want to make it back in time.
Ningguang: The Gate of Life is at Yilong Wharf, and the Gate of Concealment at Mt. Aocang. They are being seen to by Keqing and Ganyu respectively.
Ningguang: The Gate of Fright can be found at Guyun Stone Forest, and the Gate of Injury is at The Chasm. Those are assigned to Beidou and Yelan.
Ningguang: As for the Gate of Terrain at Dihua Marsh, that's been taken by the Conqueror of Demons. These five are all on location already.
