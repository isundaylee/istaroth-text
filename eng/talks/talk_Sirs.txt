Traveler: Sirs...?
Xu: Yes, I'm referring to you. The vast majority of visitors here are in big business, so I've become accustomed to speaking politely.
Xu: What's more, the master here has made it clear, if you want to be in business, you be polite to everyone.
Xu: If you treat people by their appearances, one day you're going to offend someone very important.
Xu: Call it a business principle of the Feiyun Commerce Guild if you will.
