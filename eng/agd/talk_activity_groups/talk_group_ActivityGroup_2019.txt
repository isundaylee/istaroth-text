## Talk

Baizhu: The Lantern Rite celebrations are getting better by the year. Such wonderful music...
Qiqi: Dr. Baizhu, I've brought the herbs. Who are they for?
Baizhu: The singers.
Baizhu: Performing at a music festival is very demanding. Using these herbs in good time will protect their voices from damage.
Qiqi: Oh... that's why you were preparing them all night.
Baizhu: Hehe, I dared not neglect the Yuheng's request. Her messenger was quite insistent that it should take top priority.
Baizhu: Let me double-check again... This one is for...

## Talk

Yanfei: Granny, you play so beautifully! Do you think you could teach me?
Madame Ping: Oh, child, you simply never stop, do you?
Madame Ping: This festival is a rare chance to rest and relax, but here you are pestering me to teach you this, that, and the other...
Yanfei: Don't worry, Granny, I'm a fast learner!
Yanfei: And anyway, the sooner I start learning, the sooner we'll be able to perform a duet together.
Yanfei: A musical duo is only as good as its weakest link, so you gotta teach me all your secrets, okay?
Madame Ping: Alright, alright... Well, you can start by making me some more tea, and leaving it to cool on the side.
Yanfei: Sure, Granny!

## Talk

Xinyan: Okay, now I need to get a move on and write my next song!
Yun Jin: Listen to you, you only just fulfilled one lifetime dream. Are you really thinking about your next goal already?
Xinyan: Don't try to tell me you ain't the same way. I bet you've already thought up a name for your next opera, haven't ya?
Yun Jin: Hehe... You know me too well, Xinyan.
Yun Jin: "The Adeptus-Seeking Voyage"... How does that sound?
Xinyan: Aw, man! Yeah, I can already picture it!
Yun Jin: I've also got just the finishing line for it! I will close with: "And the celestial melody echoed through the clouds forevermore."

## Talk

Dvorak: Magnificent... Absolutely magnificent...
Traveler: You mean, the show?
Dvorak: Yes... When I heard the music coming from up in the clouds, I was so stunned, I could barely think or move.
Dvorak: I felt like it had a special kind of hold over me... Hmm, or maybe it was the adeptal power within the music?
Dvorak: And the ensemble at the end was truly sublime! I felt like I would have started to cry if I hadn't been one of the performers on the stage.
Traveler: What are your plans for the future?
Dvorak: Well, Lady Ningguang, the Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing, has invited me to visit her again at Yujing Terrace to discuss a long-term collaboration plan.
Dvorak: I do hope everything goes well, and that we have more opportunities to collaborate in the future.
Dvorak: The next time we have another performance, you'll have to come! I will save the best seat for you.
Traveler: About the "fairy lady"...
Dvorak: Haha... I have already given her my thanks in person.
Dvorak: This is what she said: "It is only natural to lend a hand when we see someone in distress. The wonderful music you brought to Liyue is worth far more than gratitude."
Dvorak: Truly, I felt so honored...
Dvorak: But I've also made a decision for myself: I will strive to create even more wonderful, original music for this era... our era!
Traveler: See ya.
Dvorak: #We couldn't have accomplished all of this without you, Traveler. Please accept my most heartfelt thanks again!

## Talk

Yaoyao: I'm so happy! And all the grandmas and grandpas in Qingce Village had a great time, too.
Traveler: Why Qingce Village?
Yaoyao: You mean... what am I doing here? Well, just now, I did a performance for everyone!
Yaoyao: Although I can't play an instrument anywhere near as well as Master, I can still sing.
Yaoyao: Even Granny Ruoxin said I did a great job. She also gave me some candies, hee-hee!
Traveler: About your Master...
Yaoyao: Master's told me a lot of stories about the adepti!
Yaoyao: There was Skybracer with the giant deer horns, and Sea Gazer who loved to collect treasure...
Yaoyao: Sometimes, Master talks and talks for a long time, until her voice starts to sound sad. But then she always breaks into a smile again, and tells me all of the things each of them loved best about Liyue...
Yaoyao: I love everything about Liyue!
Yaoyao: Some of the adepti are gone now, but it's okay, because I'm gonna help take care of everyone in their stead!
Traveler: About Dvorak...
Yaoyao: I'm happy that Mr. Dvorak found the fairy lady from his story. And I'm also happy that it turned out it was Master all along.
Yaoyao: Also, I helped out this time too, didn't I? So that means I was... paying "ho-ma-ge" to my master?
Yaoyao: Oh, oh, also, Mr. Dvorak got one of his friends to bring me a toy from Fontaine! I like it a lot!
Yaoyao: At first... I didn't know whether I was supposed to accept it or not... But then Master said it was okay, so I did!
Traveler: See you.
Yaoyao: See you! Make sure you take good care of Paimon!
Yaoyao: Oh, and please come play with me if you ever have the time!

## Talk

Zhaoqin: People in our line of work get real busy during the holidays.
Zhaoqin: My mom is going to nag my ear off when I get home.
Zhaoqin: Maybe I should buy some gifts to bring back... Eh, no. It's not going to work. Dad's going to accuse me of being wasteful with Mora...
Zhaoqin: Agh, what a headache.

## Talk

Huixing: Sea conditions are consistent and there are no other vessels in target waters... Hmmm... very suitable for kicking off "Vigilance at Sea"!
Traveler: Start "Vigilance at Sea."
Huixing: Okay! Be sure to give it your all!
Traveler: About the difficulty of "Vigilance at Sea"...
Huixing: I would like to ask you guys: how did you guys find the challenge?
Paimon: #Paimon thought it wasn't too hard. This kind of test is a piece of cake for Paimon and Traveler!
Huixing: Well, considering how formidable you two are, this sounds about right.
Huixing: Thanks for your feedback. Now I know a little more! I'm going to have to think a little bit more about how to adjust the difficulty curve for both challenge and pass rate...
Traveler: About the nine certificates...
Huixing: The four major certificates and the five minor certificates? Simple.
Huixing: The four major certificates consist of the "Fit for Sailing Certificate," the "Ship Maintenance Aptitude Certificate," the "Power Maintenance Aptitude Certificate," and the "Survivability at Sea Certificate."
Huixing: The five minor certificates consist of the "Basic Safety Certificate," the "Lifeboat Certificate," the "Fire Safety Certificate," the "First Aid Certificate," and the "Monster-Precaution Certificate."
Huixing: With all these certificates, a sailor is equipped to solve most of the problems of navigation.
Huixing: Although the crew may not understand the principle of each request, they just need to remember the main points of the task and follow the instructions.
Paimon: This doesn't sound simple at all!
Traveler: And we still haven't gotten into the details yet...
Huixing: No worries! With your talent, you can sail smoothly without having to bother with all the technical details!
Traveler: I should consult Beidou when I have the chance...
Huixing: Okay! The Captain is a bit of a straight shooter. You'll probably become experts after asking her!
Traveler: I need some time to prepare.
Huixing: I understand! You guys are measured and careful, so you guys might need some more time. I trust you guys!

## Talk

Tiantian: You're back, esteemed ones! How was the racing challenge?
Traveler: Firework-flying Paimon, reporting!
Paimon: Yeah! We had a good time, and we feel great!
Tiantian: A good time? That's good to hear! I would try it myself if I was stronger.
Paimon: Maybe you should keep training, Tiantian! A strong recruiter is sure to bring more people in!
Traveler: The gunpowder gave Paimon a boost!
Paimon: Yeah! We set a record for the fastest time, and none of the other participants could catch up with us!
Tiantian: Ah, I'm starting to get excited myself! Maybe I could outdo you as the creator of this event?
Paimon: Hehehe, that won't be easy. Maybe if you actually design a gunpowder-propelled backpack, maybe you might have a chance!
Traveler: We want to try it again. Goodbye!
Tiantian: Bye! I'll be here awaiting your feedback!

## Talk

Yinggong: So, are you guys ready?
Traveler: Yes.
Yinggong: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I present to you — Homeward, Bravebeard!
Traveler: I'm not ready yet.
Yinggong: Don't worry. It's only natural to be a bit nervous.

## Talk

Hesheng: I've seen Bravebeard so many times, to the point where I can memorize every line!
Hesheng: But don't worry. I won't spoil the story. I'm way better than that.

## Talk

Qingxing: Why is the Bravebeard so formidable? I wish I could be as strong as him.

## Talk

Yinggong: Back so soon after the performance? Maybe you want to give it another go?
Traveler: I want to see it again.
Yinggong: Haha, it seems you really enjoy this. Let's do an extra performance then.
Traveler: About the Yun-Han Opera Troupe...
Yinggong: No special performance has been planned for this year's Lantern Rite. After all, we've already performed for many years' Lantern Rite in succession. So this year, we can finally have a good rest.
Yinggong: That said, I started getting a little restless and decided to put on a paper play for the kids, haha.
Traveler: See you.
Yinggong: Goodbye for now. When we meet again, I shall show you the costumes and props I've made.

## Talk

Zhongli: The vegetables are fresh, and there are enough wheats and grains stocked up... I'll pass on the seafood.
Zhongli: Oh, it's you. We meet again.
Zhongli: Surprised to see me here?
Zhongli: It's the director's orders. Xiangling worked all day and night at the restaurant during the festival and didn't get to have any time to enjoy the festivities. The director sent me here to help out in the kitchen so that Xiangling will have some time to herself.
Zhongli: But with someone as hardworking as you around, there seems to be nothing much for me to do...
Guoba: ♪~
Zhongli: It feels good seeing my old friend in the kitchen fetching ingredients and lighting fires.
Zhongli: Perhaps I should borrow Cloud Retainer's supreme cuisine machine to speed things up...
Guoba: !
Zhongli: ...You'd still prefer to make them by hand? But of course.

## Talk

Venti: This is such a cool ship!
Venti: Facing the sea breeze and gazing out at the soaring seagulls... Ah, makes me wanna sing out loud!
Venti: Kazuha, how about I stay here and be the ship's resident bard? What are my prospects?
Kaedehara Kazuha: With your level of artistic finesse, I'm sure nothing will go wrong.
Kaedehara Kazuha: But I'm afraid the sailors aboard are not the most versed in the arts. They probably wouldn't understand the deeper meaning your poetry holds.
Venti: Haha, you can't say that for sure! Poetry is spur-of-the-moment creations. Anyone viewing the same sights and experiencing the same atmosphere would surely understand.
Venti: *sigh* There's a port in Mondstadt too, but I rarely get the chance to board any of the ships.
Venti: Speaking of ships, everything's perfect about this one, except...
Kaedehara Kazuha: Hmm?
Venti: Um, Kazuha...
Venti: Could you tell your Captain that my height says nothing of my age? I'm way past drinking age.
Venti: How often does one get to enjoy a seafood feast on a ship? It'll be a real shame if there isn't anything stronger to enhance the food! Pretty please?
Kaedehara Kazuha: There's... not much I can do about that.
Kaedehara Kazuha: It's not because Captain Beidou's not on the ship right now, but because there's no room for negotiation on this matter.
Kaedehara Kazuha: Even I have to sit in the no-drinking zone every time.
Venti: *whimper* But I don't get drunk after just a few sips... Trust me, I can hold my liquor really well!

## Talk

Beidou: Hey, don't tell me you called me over just for a game of chess.
Ningguang: You have to be more specific, Captain Beidou.
Ningguang: Is it that you find playing chess an uninteresting activity, or that you're unhappy about my lack of novel ideas?
Ningguang: If you don't specify what you mean, how could I know what I should do to please you?
Beidou: Heh, of course...
Beidou: I make a single remark and you reply with a full-blown lecture.
Beidou: Maybe we should deal with all official affairs publicly in the future. Might just make things easier.
Ningguang: I'd be perfectly happy with that — I'm just worried that Captain Beidou's business might be negatively affected.
Beidou: Don't give me that.
Beidou: That woman from Yanshang Teahouse sometimes comes aboard to ask for information. She requested the fleet to import some goods, but how could I not know who she's actually working for?
Ningguang: Oh? You sure know a lot, Captain Beidou.
Ningguang: How about I ask her to come over? Or maybe we go straight to her Teahouse?
Ningguang: With one more person around, we'll be able to have some variety in our chess games. I hope that that would be less of a bore to you.
Beidou: Tsk, so we're still going to play chess after all!

## Talk

Hu Tao: Hehe, Xingqiu, you have to be honest.
Xingqiu: Hm? Honest about what?
Hu Tao: How did you and Venti really meet?
Xingqiu: Wh—Why are you suddenly asking that...
Xiangling: Eh? Aren't they book buddies?
Xingqiu: Yeah! We met a few times at a book convention, that's all...
Hu Tao: Ohh? Really?
Hu Tao: With that extraordinary demeanor and literary talent, he's definitely not just any bard.
Hu Tao: If he's someone that could hold his ground in a conversation with the consultant, he needs to at least be as talented as me!
Xingqiu: Um, perhaps you're overthinking this matter...
Hu Tao: Ah...
Xiangling: Hu Tao, Xingqiu wouldn't lie to us...
Xingqiu: *sigh* Okay, I'll tell you the truth.
Xiangling: Huh!?
Chongyun: Xingqiu...!
Xingqiu: I'm actually a fan of Venti's poetry.
Xingqiu: You all know that I love reading, and sometimes come across poetry from Mondstadt.
Xingqiu: Among those works, I admire the ones penned by Venti the most. Just as Hu Tao said, his artistry is the reflection of his personality — remarkable grace and exceptional literary talent.
Xingqiu: I guess Venti didn't tell you the whole truth back at the restaurant because he didn't want to embarrass me in front of everyone... He's such a considerate person.
Chongyun: ...Yes, right. I can confirm that.
Chongyun: When Xingqiu was busy with other things, he asked me to buy him poetry books in secret.
Xiangling: I see...
Xiangling: That didn't sound like too much of a big deal. You could've told us right away.
Xingqiu: Well, I'm telling you now, aren't I?
Hu Tao: Oh... So that's your story...
Hu Tao: ...Ah, forget it. Let's drop this topic.
Hu Tao: It's not often that the four of us are all together. What should we do next? Hide-and-seek, hopscotch, or some shopping?
Chongyun: Since there's four of us... Why don't we borrow a mahjong set?

## Talk

Xiao: Yanxiao just came up here with some Almond Tofu, but... I haven't finished everything Xiangling gave me yet...
Xiao: You should try some too. I'm not as experienced in tasting mortal food as you, and I couldn't tell the difference.
Xiao: ...There must be many different stories to tell of the hustle and bustle of the mortal world, too. You can tell me. I will listen.

## Talk

Musheng: Heh, doubtless, the city is more festive.
Musheng: The heroes we commemorate during Lantern Rite are actually adepti who lived in Liyue in the distant past.
Musheng: Do you know which adeptus the Mingxiao Lantern commemorates this year?
Musheng: I asked around for information, and a gentleman who looked very knowledgeable told me that the adeptus' name is Sea Gazer.
Musheng: He is said to be a collector of exotic treasures. I'm sure an adeptus like him will bless everyone with wealth and prosperity.

## Talk

Hongyu: Things feel more or less the same, year after year...
Hongyu: Not that it's a bad thing. Though nothing particularly good happened, there was nothing bad either.
Hongyu: I hope next year will go smoothly as usual.

## Talk

Ying'er: Oh my, if it isn't my old acquaintance. Did you come all this way during Lantern Rite just to see me?
Ying'er: It's been a while, but you still look as lovely as ever.
Ying'er: Ah, it's the Lantern Rite, but I don't really have much time to spare. Can't help it when the shop's so popular, you know? Otherwise...
Ying'er: ...Hehe, anyway, why don't you feast your eyes on what we've got in store? Who knows, you might chance upon some extra benefits.
Ying'er: I mean, I'm just a slap of lipstick and a dab of makeup compared to those beauties.

## Talk

Chen the Sharp: Hey there, are you here to sight-see and have some fun? If you're hungry, wanna grab a couple of freshly-grilled Tiger Fish?
Chen the Sharp: Even the adepti love it! Get it while it's hot!

## Talk

Hammer Li: Festivals, eh? Well, it's nice and all. The lights are pretty, and things are livelier than usual.
Hammer Li: But you know, it's not like it's got all that much to do with me...

## Talk

Atsuko: Hello, hello... Uh, I mean...
Atsuko: Ahem. Happy Lantern Rite! May you stay healthy and hale, and may all go well with you!
Atsuko: Haha, I guess I've finally gotten used to the festive greetings that locals give one another...

Changchang: When is Daddy coming back? Is it too late to write him and ask for a flute?

## Talk

Yiran: Manager Kuan, I wanna hear a song. Sing a song for me!
Manager Kuan: Firstly, for the umpteenth time, just call me "Daddy."
Yiran: No! And don't try to change the subject.
Yiran: It's a music festival, so everyone should be playing music or singing!
Yiran: Playing music is a little too difficult for you, Manager Kuan, but you should at least sing something!
Manager Kuan: I'm not a singer, I'm just Manager Kuan... No, wait, I'm your Daddy!
Yiran: Since you're my Daddy, wouldn't it be natural that you'd be better than me?
Yiran: Even I can sing a few lines... Lalala~... lala~!
Yiran: If Manager Kuan can't sing better than me, how can he be my Daddy?

Huixin: Hello, welcome to Liyue, and welcome to the Lantern Rite Festival!
Huixin: You must have heard about the music festival held in collaboration with the Iridescence Tour during this year's Lantern Rite.
Huixin: I hope everyone can have a good time during the festival and enjoy the musical atmosphere.
Huixin: Of course, for civil matters, please go to the Liyue Ministry of Civil Affairs.

## Talk

Kun: Hey, this is the big day! The annual Lantern Rite is finally here!
Kun: You see, seeing all of Liyue Harbor this lively is quite a rare sight.
Kun: And for the finale of this year's Lantern Rite, they'll be holding a musical performance!
Kun: It's also said to have something to do with Fontaine's renowned Iridescence Tour!
Kun: I heard they haven't done a show in a while, so this one can't be missed!

## Talk

Linling: The glow of Xiao Lanterns fills the night sky, shedding light on lands below as they fly. The lighting of the stage dances before one's eyes, as a sea of people are singing together...
Linling: Yes, yes...

## Talk

Iron Tongue Tian: Have you heard? This year's Lantern Rite has a new event: a musical performance!
Iron Tongue Tian: If you want to fit in, you should talk about music.
Iron Tongue Tian: But it's hard to attract an audience when you have a romantic atmosphere without a powerful scene...
Iron Tongue Tian: Do you think it's possible to combine singing and fighting?
Iron Tongue Tian: Winning a battle while being accompanied by a dynamic rhythm... Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
Iron Tongue Tian: You wouldn't be able to hear of this story from my fellow, Tea Master Liu Su. All he does is talk about dry, prissy, genteel stuff!

## Talk

Clerk Zhao: Phew... Lantern Rite is such a tiring time. I should take a moment to rest...
Clerk Zhao: But the moment I stop, the anxiety just hits me all over again...
Clerk Zhao: After all, Lady Yuheng has assigned a new task for the music festival, so I still can't rest...

## Talk

Yong'an: Hello. I... you... cat... ATCHOO!
Yong'an: I'm sorry... After hearing that there'll be a music festival, people sometimes come to the pier to play and sing...
Yong'an: The cats around them got scared and ran around, shedding their fur everywhere...
Yong'an: I... cats... aaa... ATCHOO!

## Talk

Sisi: Oh hello, if it's an invitation to go to a musical performance, I'm afraid I must decline. There's someone I'm waiting for.

Vlad: I didn't know that you liked music so much... I'm so glad I invited you here.
Nadia: And thank you for inviting me. I've never had such a great time enjoying live music...
Nadia: I don't know much about music, but with the person beside— Ahem, with all these people around, it's been a great experience.
Vlad: That's great! You've always been a quiet person, so I was afraid you wouldn't like this kind of event.
Vlad: Looks like I should keep an eye out for more music festivals like this in the future...

Ivanovich: The glow of the Xiao Lanterns feels so warm...
Ivanovich: And I don't know if it's because of the music festival performance, but the stage lights made the lantern even brighter.
Ivanovich: This blazing heat ignites a nostalgic flame in me...

## Talk

Jiayi: While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail.
Jiayi: Have you seen the music festival? The resounding echoes are sure to reach places farther than the Xiao Lanterns do...
Jiayi: ...Perhaps you'll even be able to hear the music from atop the hills of Qingce Village.
Jiayi: *sigh* Little Liu... I miss you so much...

## Talk

Andrei: Why, hello there. How may I help you?
Andrei: If this is about work, please allow me to decline for now. This festive season is quite hard to come by after all. Feeling the sea breeze, listening to the music... It is all ever so pleasant...

## Talk

Traveler: About the Lantern Rite music festival...
Linlang: There's usually a familiar sense of nostalgia in the air during the Lantern Rite, and it complements my store perfectly.
Linlang: This year's Lantern Rite music festival, however, has brought along some new ideas.
Linlang: People may become interested in music-related antiques, so I should probably read up on related legends too...
Linlang: After all, every ancient object that has weathered the ages has a fascinating story to tell.
