# A Tour of Wonders

Onnea: Please wait! Are you also here for the King of Invokations Grand Prix?
Onnea: If you have a minute, I'd like to tell you a little about this event hosted by the Adventurers' Guild called "A Tour of Wonders."
Traveler: Um... sure?
Onnea: Thank you! Then I'll go ahead and introduce the basics of this event.
Onnea: Simply put, the Adventurers' Guild has placed multiple Scenic Checkpoints in various locations across Mondstadt.
Onnea: All you have to do is find these Scenic Checkpoints and mark your Sightseeing Handbook with the commemorative stamps at each location.
Onnea: The challenge will be considered completed once you find every Scenic Checkpoint and collect all the stamps.
Traveler: Sure sounds like something the Adventurers' Guild would host.
Onnea: Hehe... We put a lot of thought into the placement of these Scenic Checkpoints.
Onnea: However... some of them are located in remote areas, and I can't guarantee they're entirely clear of monsters.
Onnea: But I'm sure that dealing with those monsters would be a walk in the park for someone as experienced as you.
Onnea: And that's all from me! Here's your Sightseeing Handbook. Have fun!
Traveler: Okay, let's hear it...
