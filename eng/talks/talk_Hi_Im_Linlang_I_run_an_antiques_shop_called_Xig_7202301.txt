Linlang: Hi, I'm Linlang. I run an antiques shop called Xigu Antiques... I don't know if we've met?
Linlang: There's an abiding sense of nostalgia in the air at Lantern Rite... Normally I only get that feeling in my shop; I love it, it makes me feel so at home.
Linlang: Lantern Rite is much more ancient than any of the antiques in my shop, though.
Linlang: Antiquity has real value. I should know, I make my living off that fact. So make the most of this very precious time of year.
