Bracari: Perhaps I should grill a few more cookies for the children? Or perhaps that Bulle Fruit cake from the last time — that was pretty good.

Traveler: What can you tell me about this receipt...
Bracari: A recent sale of pliers, saws, and candles? Well now, that's a strange question...
Bracari: If you want ingredients for snacks, I've got them aplenty, but these things are difficult to move, darling, I haven't got many in stock.
Paimon: We don't want to buy this stuff, Ma'am. We're just asking if someone else came to purchase them from you recently.
Bracari: Ooh, let me think, then... Yes, yes, I remember some people indeed.
Bracari: It was two youngsters, a man and a woman. They bought the items several days ago.
Bracari: They said that they wanted to do some woodwork at home, but needed some tools. Is something the matter?
Paimon: Oh, no, no, w—we're just doing a... socioeconomic survey.
Bracari: A socioeconomic survey, you say? Hehe, you're here looking for information on them, aren't you?
Bracari: This happens all too often, little one. No need to try so hard to make excuses.
Bracari: The two of them went to Benoit Leroy's old house, if that's what you're asking.
Traveler: Could you tell me anything about Benoit?
Bracari: Ah, so that's what you're here for. Well, that's no surprise.
Bracari: Once you've reached a certain age, your past will catch up to you — it matters not where you move to.
Paimon: Do you know anything about all this, Ma'am?
Bracari: Me? Well, I wasn't very close to Benoit. If you'd like to know about his family, you should look for Snodgrass.
Bracari: Go on, then. Snodgrass is a right layabout. You should be able to find him loitering about nearby.

Traveler: It certainly sounds tasty.
Bracari: Hehe, as long as the children like it, all is well.
Bracari: The adults here are very busy with work, so children often come and buy things for their families, and I bring them snacks when they do.
Bracari: Sometimes that girl Navia drops by too, bringing gifts of all sizes. She asks for cake pretty often, too — just like a kid, she is...

Traveler: Tell me about Navia...
Bracari: I'm an old acquaintance of her father. Got a hand in her marksmanship, too, if I do say so myself.
Bracari: Of course, she didn't learn it here. This place is too small — any drawing of weapons isn't going to end well for anyone.
Bracari: If someone does dare cause trouble here, they will be sent away to start a new life in the ocean.
