# Tadhla the Falcon


## Talk 1

Masseira: #Ah, {NICKNAME}, esteemed Master of the Jinni. To what do I owe the pleasure?
Liloupar: Splendid. Another desert-spawn. My master, I— *sigh* Never mind. I trust your judgment.
Masseira: Could you spare a minute for me? I've been looking forward to seeing you as I've been to seeing the moon and rain.
Liloupar: Don't let us doubt your intent. Just cut to the chase.
Masseira: Very well, Master of the Jinni, I do have a request...
Masseira: Haha, nothing serious. It's just my Falcon, Tadhla. I think she's in danger.
Masseira: *sigh* If it weren't for my weak legs, I wouldn't be troubling you for this...
Paimon: Correct Paimon if she's wrong. You want us to rescue her before thanking us profusely, paying us a large sum of Mora, and treating us to a big meal for our triumph, right?
Masseira: Uh... Yes, yes.
Paimon: Well, if that's the case, we'll do it!
Traveler: Paimon always gets extra logical when it comes to such situations...
Liloupar: *sigh* Alright, let's do it for Paimon's big meal.
Masseira: Thank you so much. I'm counting on you.
Masseira: Let me mark out her last known location.
Masseira: The person you need to look for, Tadhla, is tall, tanned, with light-colored long hair, and uses a long bow. Yes, this should be enough information about her.
Masseira: Did you get it all?
Paimon: Hmm... A tall, tanned girl with light-colored long hair and holds a long bow! Hehe, Paimon has an excellent memory!
Masseira: May the wind guide you through sandstorms and away from danger.
Paimon: Thank you. We'll see you soon!

## Talk 2

Masseira: Did you find her?
Masseira: I see, you still need some time.
Masseira: Please find her as soon as possible. Time is not on our side.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Shh... See? There's someone over there!
Liloupar: Hmm... My master, be those the people whom you mentioned? The "Fooltui"?
Traveler: It's the "Fatui."
Liloupar: That name makes them sound no wiser.
Paimon: Shh! Keep it down! If they see us...
Liloupar: Be placid. They hear nothing of my words. Here, bear witness...
Liloupar: Ahoy! You! Corpulent one! Over here! Time to eat!
Fatui Skirmisher No. 1: Hmm? Did you hear anything?
Fatui Skirmisher No. 2: No, why?
Fatui Skirmisher No. 1: Hmm... I thought I heard someone saying time to eat.
Liloupar: Hehe, see?
Paimon: Paimon didn't know Liloupar has a childlike side! Hehe, it's adorable.
Paimon: Look! Over there! Is that Tadhla they got locked up?
Paimon: Hmm... Tall, tanned, light-colored long hair... That should be her.
Liloupar: Well done, little one. The task is upon us, my master.
Paimon: #Yeah, {NICKNAME}, let's do this!

## Talk 4

Tadhla: ...
Paimon: Um... Are you Tadhla? We are here to get you out!
Tadhla: Yes...? Oh, yes.
Tadhla: You let them go.
Traveler: They are no longer a threat.
Tadhla: ...They will flee and send warning to their comrades. Soon, they will all know that we are here.
Liloupar: The wise are joined of thought. I like this girl.
Paimon: It doesn't matter. If they come back for us, we'll just kick their butts again! Although... you're injured. Do you need help?
Tadhla: I'm okay. I can still walk and find myself a decent place to die in peace.
Paimon: Oh, that's a relief, she can still walk and find herself a decent place to— Hey! That's not what Paimon expected to hear!
Tadhla: Just kidding.
Liloupar: Hahaha.
Liloupar: I like this girl's humor... Her vagaries are most amusing.
Tadhla: Thank you. Let's return to the tribe.
Traveler: Is it difficult to walk?
Tadhla: It is, but I don't need any help.
Traveler: You don't even need any rest?
Tadhla: Rest? No. I barely know you.
Liloupar: Then, perhaps we should get more acquainted. What say you?
Tadhla: Thank you, but maybe later.
Traveler: We don't need to kill them.

## Talk 5

Masseira: Ah, here's my little Falcon! Thank you so much!
Tadhla: Sorry, I was ambushed. It was all thanks to them that I can return and see you again.
Masseira: "Them"? Your "them" is our esteemed Master of the Jinni!
Tadhla: I'm sorry...
Paimon: Oh come on, it's okay! Tadhla is injured, be nice to her!
Tadhla: ...
Masseira: You're injured?
Tadhla: I'm sorry.
Masseira: By what? Animal, or human?
Tadhla: It was the northerners. They ambushed me after realizing they were being followed.
Masseira: You should've been the ambusher.
Masseira: Being attacked by the prey. What a shame for a Falcon.
Tadhla: ...
Masseira: Go rest. I'll tend to your wound later.
Black Screen Text: Tadhla silently nods and slowly treads away in pain.
Paimon: Masseira sure is a bit too strict with Tadhla...
Traveler: Are you two not getting along?
Masseira: Hmm? No, that would be nonsense. She's my favorite Falcon. I love her, but I don't spoil her. How do you feed a Falcon if the Falcon comes back empty-handed?
Liloupar: Ah, so such is the case... An ugly end awaits this girl.
Masseira: Please accept this. You have my gratitude, esteemed Master of the Jinni.
Liloupar: Ahem. Aren't you forgetting something? There are still two of us besides your Master of the Jinni.
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon doubts both of us are qualified to accept the reward...
Liloupar: Ah... Yes, of course. The fact that this floating fairy is technically not a person has eluded me till thus, but perhaps the rest of us people may receive due thanks?
Paimon: Hey!
Masseira: Haha, my apologies. Please take this as an extra payment.
Paimon: Ooh, extra payment!
Liloupar: ...Still more paltry than my expectations... But I suppose I will accept this if you should not object, my master.
Masseira: Very well. If you are available in the future, please come back one more time. I think my Falcon will need your help by then.
Traveler: Please don't be too harsh to her.
Masseira: Harsh? No, instead I've been too kind to her. That's why she has become so... sloppy. All I'm doing is educating her. She's an outstanding Falcon. How could I ever hurt her?
Liloupar: So, then, what stands as the most common fate to grace a Falcon...
