Traveler: Hello?
Jiangzhou: ...And there's the fire hazards. Feiyun Slope should be okay, but here at Chihu Rock it's difficult to have eyes everywhere once the place gets crowded...
Jiangzhou: More people means more torches... I need to write a report to warn them about this...
Traveler: Hello?
Jiangzhou: ...We also can't have too much restaurant seating spilling out into the streets, it would be a total disaster if someone were to get trampled...
Jiangzhou: But how do we explain that to the restaurants? Ugh, there's so many things to juggle...
Traveler: Excuse me, can you hear me?
Jiangzhou: Oh! Goodness! I almost forgot... All those cats and dogs around the harbor need somewhere to stay...
Jiangzhou: There's a thought; Yong'an is always on duty here, and he loves cats and dogs. So does Manager Xiao. I wonder if they'd be happy to help...
