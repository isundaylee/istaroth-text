Traveler: About Miss Chisato...
Kujou Kamaji: Thanks to you, we can finally write to each other now. I really appreciate your help.
Kujou Kamaji: Hmm... I don't know if she likes the snacks I made for her... If possible, I'd really like to meet her myself.
Kujou Kamaji: There are still so many things left for me to do. For our clan... and my own future.
