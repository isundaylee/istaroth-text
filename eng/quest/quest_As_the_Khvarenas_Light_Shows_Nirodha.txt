# As the Khvarena's Light Shows: Nirodha


## Talk 1

Nasejuna: Missing text (4259498626)

## Talk 2

Nasejuna: <color=#00E1FFFF>"Turn the gears such that all three types of runes are displayed. Ensure that the square rune is connected to the triangular rune at the bottom without changing said triangle."</color> Simply do as I instruct, and we should be fine.

## Talk 3

Paimon: That weird cannon emerged from the ground! Are they trying to say that we should shoot that big machine over there?
Paimon: Hmm... Such a thoughtful design.
Sorush: Your imagination truly is wild, Pale Floater. Did Nasuraia not say earlier that this place was modified from its original form as a proving ground for testing machine functionality?
Sorush: It appears that the device we unlocked earlier was meant to be used to activate the proving ground.
Sorush: It seems that the modifications did not include the dismantling of the original devices. A most helpful discovery indeed.
Sorush: In that case, my Yasnapati, the honor of operating this cannon shall be yours.

## Talk 4

Nasejuna: Behold, the moment of destiny is at hand!
Traveler: ...
Paimon: This is just a normal mechanical door!
Nasejuna: *cough* I mean to say that as long as we open this mechanical door, we will gain access to the ruins.
Nasejuna: Haha, this is my first time entering a Dahrian ruin, you know? Is it so surprising that I might be excited?
Paimon: Eh? You sounded so confident earlier that Paimon thought you must've explored loads of ruins.
Nasejuna: Hah! Well, I can't claim to have personally explored them. But with this copy of "Rene's Investigation Notes," written as it is by an excellent scholar of ancient histories, it is as though I were there in the flesh!
Traveler: "Rene's Investigation Notes"?
Nasejuna: Have you never heard of it? I thought that only one sequestered in a distant desert such as I would not have heard of such a brilliant scholar.
Nasejuna: These notes contain a lot of records left by the people of Dahri. According to the author, he once discovered knowledge that "surpasses mortals" in these ruins.
Paimon: This sounds harder to believe by the moment.
Nasejuna: Leaving that aside for the moment, now that we have these notes, entering these Dahrian ruins should be a simple matter.
Nasejuna: If you don't believe me, let's test this! For example, if we'd like to open this device... Oh, there we go!
Nasejuna: <color=#00E1FFFF>"Turn the gears such that all three types of runes are displayed. Ensure that the square rune is connected to the triangular rune at the bottom without changing said triangle."</color> Simply do as I instruct, and we should be fine.

## Talk 5

Nasejuna: Looks like we've finally reached the heart of these ruins. Now then, as the one amongst us who has done a fair amount of research into Dahrian ruins, allow me to tell you all about it.
Nasejuna: According to the notes I have, this was once a proving ground where the Dahrians would conduct research and tests. The Great Song of Khvarena we seek is at the deepest part of this facility.
Nasejuna: If we want to reach it, we'll first have to, hmm...
Paimon: You were just saying that you'd done your homework, and you're fumbling about already?
Nasejuna: Well, the makeup of these ruins really is too complicated. I doubt anyone could fully understand the principles behind the mysterious machines that the Dahrians used just from descriptions alone.
Nasejuna: Let me see... Ah, there we go. Looks like our current position is that of the control hub for the entire proving ground.
Nasejuna: If we wish to reach the Great Song, we must first activate the entire ruins' control mechanisms. To do so, we have to solve an energy issue.
Nasejuna: Though the people of Dahri are said to have been able to use the power of impurity to operate machines and master monsters, it seems that these ruins don't do so.
Nasejuna: On the contrary, it seems that they used a form of energy known as Azosite. It was drawn from pure elemental energy before being formed into blocks.
Nasejuna: That means that as long as we find an Energy Block of this kind, we will be able to provide energy to these cores, after which we should be able to settle any other problems with ease.
Sorush: That sounds troublesome. Now if only we could simply settle this through combat.
Traveler: Well, let's begin, then.
Nasejuna: Ah, raring to go, I see. That's the Envoy's Yasnapati, indeed.
Nasejuna: In that case, I will leave the work of searching for the Energy Block to you. This is a set of schematics that shows the layout of the proving ground. I'm sure you'll put it to good use.
Nasejuna: In the meantime, I have some other things I must examine. As such, I'll wait for you to return here. With the honored Envoy by your side, this shall be child's play — I know it.
Nasejuna: If you encounter any issues, just examine these schematics a bit more closely.

Sorush: That sounds troublesome. Now if only we could simply settle this through combat.
Traveler: Well, let's begin, then.
Traveler: This feels somewhat familiar.
Nasejuna: Ah, raring to go, I see. That's the Envoy's Yasnapati, indeed.
Paimon: That's true. Didn't we find similar devices within that large machine that we operated elsewhere in Sumeru?
Nasejuna: Ah, so you have seen such devices before, have you? That makes things much easier for us.
Nasejuna: In that case, I will leave the work of searching for the Energy Block to you. This is a set of schematics that shows the layout of the proving ground. I'm sure you'll put it to good use.
Nasejuna: In the meantime, I have some other things I must examine. As such, I'll wait for you to return here. With the honored Envoy by your side, this shall be child's play — I know it.
Nasejuna: If you encounter any issues, just examine these schematics a bit more closely.

## Talk 7

Nasejuna: Just install the Energy Block into these Energy Cores, and the whole control system should start!

## Talk 8

Nasejuna: It is just as the notes say... Hmm? You're back already?
Nasejuna: But judging from your appearance, you must've found the Energy Block we require.
Nasejuna: I have examined these Energy Cores... They are very well-preserved. Now, all that is needed is to install the Energy Block into them.
Nasejuna: ...And that, I shall leave in your hands.

## Talk 9

Nasejuna: What is it? Is there some problem?
Nasejuna: You need only follow the schematics, find the Energy Block, and return here.

## Talk 10

Nasejuna: The Energy Cores have been filled. Now, we should be able to activate the control systems...
Nasejuna: Huh? That wasn't what I was expecting. Is there a problem somewhere?
Nasejuna: It seems as if we'll need to go have a look at the control center where the relays are. Which is fine, it's on the way to the proving ground all the same.
Nasejuna: Well now, it seems the control center is in the direction you previously came from. Since that's the case, let's go together!

## Talk 11

Nasejuna: As I thought. The problem lies with these relays. The energy from the Energy Cores isn't reaching them. We need to find a way to connect them...
Nasejuna: And some of the relays in this place have been sealed in crystal... But since these ruins don't use impurities as an energy source, they shouldn't have come to the attention of Khvarena at all...
Nasejuna: The only explanation for that has to be that this place was intentionally sealed by someone with the ability to use Khvarena. But why would they do that? What are they trying to hide?
Nasejuna: Well, I suppose this can be discussed later. Our current task is still to use Khvarena's power to remove the Gray Crystals that have formed those seals.
Nasejuna: There should be Farrwicks nearby that contain Khvarena's power. I believe you can sense it too, mighty Envoy?
Sorush: Umm... Hmph. Of course! Are you doubting my majestic power as the Bloomguard?
Nasejuna: Hardly, I would never dare! Please, great and eminent Envoy, guide us.
Nasejuna: We just need to find the Farrwicks, remove the Gray Crystals, and then use the mixer once again to connect these relays.

## Talk 12

Nasejuna: Great Envoy, and her honored Yasnapati, I fear that this is as far as I may attend you.
Traveler: And what's the problem this time?
Nasejuna: According to the texts, the road ahead is full of perils that no ordinary mortal may bear.
Nasejuna: Once we go in here, we shall be within the proving ground that the Dahrians once used to test their machines. There is even an incomplete prototype of a giant machine amongst them.
Nasejuna: The copied Dahrian records in my notes say that this place was once modified for use as fortifications from which the monsters could be attacked, although it didn't see much use in that regard.
Nasejuna: Strange, isn't it? Why would the Dahrians, who triggered the defiling disaster, create machines to fight monsters?
Nasejuna: All the same, now that we have activated the control systems for these ruins, the defensive mechanisms within the proving ground must also have been activated.
Nasejuna: The Great Song we are searching for should be within that Golem. Though I am stymied, I suspect that it will prove easy for you all.
Nasejuna: Please allow me to stay here and await your return, so that we may be able to obtain all the Great Songs of Khvarena.
Sorush: Well, you are indeed but a mere human. Such a request is to be expected.
Nasejuna: By your gracious leave, then.
Paimon: Well, guess Nasejuna's slipping off at the last moment. Still, Paimon's a lot happier now that the two of you won't be bouncing off each other for a while...

## Talk 13

Nasejuna: If I went along with you, I suspect I would only drag you all down. As such, I shall simply wait here.
Nasejuna: But I believe that whether it be Dahrian machines or the monsters of Dev, they shall be no match for the great Envoy or yourself.

## Talk 14

Nasejuna: Ah, as one might expect of the great Envoy and her Yasnapati. Neither the Dahrian machines nor the creatures of Dev were able to stop you.
Paimon: Eh? When did you get in here, Nasejuna?
Nasejuna: Why, I was watching your wondrous battles from the side, and oh, what a sight it was! Then, upon seeing that you had the Great Song in hand, I rushed to meet with you, of course!
Nasejuna: Good work, all of you. And while we're on this topic, perhaps you might give the Great Songs of Khvarena to me for safekeeping? I mean, well, it might... How should I say this... give me a greater sense of my participation in our grand endeavor?
Paimon: But you didn't do all that much from the start, and anyway, Zurvan said that we shouldn't give the Great Songs of Khvarena away carelessly.
Nasejuna: Oh, don't say that. I mean, I have done so much research on them! I'm sure that a little examination on my part will be of help later!
Nasejuna: For example, we could find out why these Great Songs of Khvarena have come to be hidden in these ruins, and...
Sorush: This is not the time for stories, Nasuraia.
Paimon: That's right! We need to go to the next place where we can find a Great Khvarena, don't we?
Paimon: You can tell us your stories again once we've gotten them all, Nasejuna.
Nasejuna: Well... alright.
