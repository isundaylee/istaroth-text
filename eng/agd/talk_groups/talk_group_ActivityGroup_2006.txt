# Talk Group: ActivityGroup - 2006

## Talk

Muzhen: *sigh* Only after following Captain Beidou across the lands did I realize that Liyue was best...
Muzhen: Well, I say that, but I've never really gotten off the boat.
Traveler: So, as for that next leg of the journey...
Muzhen: Nope, sorry, that's confidential. I can only tell you that we're going to Sumeru next.
Muzhen: I can't say much more, and I'd suggest that you refrain from asking.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Muzhen: Alright. Hope things go well with you!

## Talk

Muzhen: At this point, we've got enough to determine the general area in which these Ruin machines are located. But we still can't pinpoint their precise location.
Traveler: How's the view from the shore?
Muzhen: You mean from here? Well, it's certainly wider than it was below deck. It's not bad.
Muzhen: Still, I'm not very fond of the air here. It's just missing that little "something" that I usually have below deck. I swear it's making my brain work slower.
Muzhen: The shore's good for a view, but not great for thinking.
Muzhen: Which is why I'm just wringing my hands over here. Guess the rest is up to you!
Paimon: Gee, this lady couldn't beg and plead to save her life!
Muzhen: Hehe~
Traveler: How's your research coming along?
Muzhen: Not great. Well, I'm stuck, to be honest.

## Talk

Muzhen: Phew, we're almost there. Once this is over, I'll be able to return to the ship!
Traveler: You seem rather pleased.
Muzhen: Quite alright, quite alright. I've remained onshore enough, and I've made great progress in my research. Our sampling order is just about complete!
Muzhen: Hahah! To think that we were able to get this done without the Captain's help... I can't wait to see how shocked she'll be at our progress!
Traveler: Your progress in making me do your job for you, you mean?
Muzhen: Oh, and, ah... your progress, of course! It's been quite splendid, it has!
Paimon: Huh. Guess Captain Beidou's got some unreliable subordinates too, huh...
Traveler: How's progress lately?

## Talk

Muzhen: *yawn* So sleepy... What's so good about being on land, anyway...
Muzhen: Ah, hello there Traveler! Thanks for your help thus far.
Muzhen: It's all thanks to you that we've got enough for the Captain to complete the order.
Traveler: Who would want this stuff, anyway...
Muzhen: Aye, rather dangerous-looking, eh?
Muzhen: Well, our next objective is Sumeru, and I suppose only those weird researchers would study these things, anyway.
Muzhen: They aren't like those traveling scholars who wander about outdoors. I believe they're people more akin to myself â€” technical experts who spend most of their time in their studies researching items.
Muzhen: I would guess that those ruins don't just contain these few machines, either...
Muzhen: If you're interested, you can continue to explore those ruins and pass any components you find to me. I'll pay well for them!
Muzhen: After all, "the more the merrier" is the watchword here, both for us and for our client in Sumeru!
Traveler: Not back below decks yet?
Muzhen: Yes. My share of the work's basically done. I'm only needed again once the cargo inspection has been completed.
Muzhen: As a result, Sea Drake kicked me back onto the shore.
Muzhen: "Stop cooping yourself up in your cabin. Get some of that sea breeze, it'll do you some good." Hmph, he should just speak for himself!
Muzhen: *yawn* Well, if there's nothing else, I'll be taking a nap now. Please excuse me...
Traveler: You're still here?
Traveler: These components look rather sinister.
