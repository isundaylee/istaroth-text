Battuta: W—Wait a moment, time out! This is way too much exercise for a scholar like me...
Nzinga: What, for real? But you've only done a tiny bit more since our last outing. Training load's gotta go up sometime.
Nzinga: Can't start teaching you how to wrestle properly until your basic fitness is up to snuff.
Nzinga: Aren't you looking forward to the day when you'll unleash your inner beast for the whole world to see?
Battuta: Well, not like I'm going pro, is it... I just wanted to get a little — emphasis on "a little" — exercise...
Nzinga: I see... Shame. You're quite the looker, you know? The crowds would love you.
Battuta: Huh!? Wh—What kind of marketing tactic is that?
Nzinga: Hmm? I think you might've gotten the wrong end of the stick — I wasn't planning on charging you. I have to exercise myself, so helping someone else out in the meantime's no sweat off my back.
Battuta: Okay, I... I guess I'll give this another shot, then?

Battuta: Am I... really up to it?

Traveler: Is something the matter?
Battuta: *panting*... I... Should be fine. My fitness coach left me some daily exercises to get on with, so I'm doing my best to finish them.
Battuta: But to be honest, though I've certainly gotten somewhat fitter after all this time, I still find this back-to-back stair-climbing quite challenging...
Battuta: When the Abyss invaded, my coach went back to her tribe to help out. I have no idea when she'll be back.
Battuta: But I don't want to trouble the couriers with such a trivial matter, especially as my stamina's still lacking...
Battuta: I'm still quite a way from reaching the goals she set for me, so I guess I'd better just grit my teeth and keep chugging on for now.
