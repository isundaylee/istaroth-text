Amber: Hahaha, it's been ages since I've built a snowman — it's so fun! Still a little cold, though... Brrr... My fingers are numb...
Eula: Amber, if the cold is getting to you, there's always hot soup back at the camp. Take a rest if you need one. Don't put too much pressure on yourself.
Joel: So Amber really feels the cold, huh... but Aunty Eula, it doesn't seem to affect you at all.
Eula: Maybe it's because of our different capabilities. Elemental energy is... Ahem, sorry, not something you need to know about in any great detail. Simply put, it's because we have different abilities.
Amber: Yeah, harnessing the cold is definitely her specialty. In fact — in summertime, just standing next to her cools me down!
Joel: Huh... c—capability? I didn't really get it, but... never mind. I like snowmen too.
Joel: I, uh... really wish my dad could see them...

Joel: Hey, Traveler, it's you!

## Talk

Traveler: How have things been going recently?
Joel: Things are going great! Dad still doesn't remember a ton of stuff, but I'm just happy to have his company!
Joel: I've found some toys that we used to play with together. Maybe he'll remember a couple more things once he sees them!
Joel: I mean, I'd be okay even if he doesn't remember everything. We'll find new toys to play with, and we'll make new memories together!
Joel: Like... Uh...

## Talk

Traveler: Like snowmen?
Joel: Yeah, like snowmen! I love 'em! And hide-and-seek, and building blocks, and reading stories...
Joel: The snow around here is super thick and white. We've already agreed to go make a snowman shaped like a fox later!

## Talk

Traveler: See you around, then.
Joel: Yup, see you!

## Talk

Traveler: He'll be fine.
Joel: Thanks... Well, you look like a Traveler. Will be you be going up the mountain to go on more adventures?
Joel: If you are, then please take this pocket watch with you.
Joel: An adventurer gave this to me. He said that it's a watch that brings you luck.
Joel: I wanted to give it to Daddy, but I could never find the chance...
Joel: If you're going up the mountain, you should take it. Hope it'll bring you good luck. Have a safe trip!

## Talk

Traveler: Take care of yourself now.
Joel: Yup, sure will!
Joel: Oh well, an adventurer gave this to me previously... He said that it's a watch that brings you luck.
Joel: I mean, I found Dad again, so I guess it must be a lucky watch after all!
Joel: I'll give it to you now. I sure hope it brings you as much luck as it did me!

## Talk

Joel: Who's th— No, Daddy said that I should be more polite...
Joel: ...How do you do?

## Talk

Traveler: Your father?
Joel: Yup, he's an adventurer.
Joel: He said that he would come to pick me up and that we'd go see the snow together. But the time we arranged has come and gone, and he isn't here yet...
Joel: I thought that he must have found some rare and precious treasure map or something, which is why he hasn't come to find me yet. That has to be it, right?
Joel: So I came to Dragonspine by myself. If he's not going to come find me, then I'll go looking for him... Or so I thought...

## Talk

Traveler: So, have you found him yet?
Joel: No... That Knight of Favonius over there said that he'd headed off for the mountain's summit...
Joel: I wanted to go search for him, but the Knight wouldn't let me. So I'm stuck here waiting for Daddy to come back.
Joel: I'll see him for sure, though. We promised to go see the snow together. There's no way that he'd break his promise.

## Talk

Traveler: See you around then, kid.
Joel: Goodbye.
Joel: Well, I've seen the snow. Now all that's left is to find Daddy...
