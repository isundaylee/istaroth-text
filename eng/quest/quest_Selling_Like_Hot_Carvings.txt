## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Paimon: Now that the toymakers' problems are resolved, let's go see how Tanger and Razi are doing!

### Additional Talk 2

Razi: The Aranara father owned up to his mistake and was forgiven by his Aranara son...
Razi: Hmm... I think everyone will like how the story goes, but the conflict was resolved a little too quickly.
Tanger: Perhaps we could let them go through some kind of hardship together. I'm sure they'll become more understanding of each other. We can make the Aranara father feel remorseful after seeing his son's efforts.
Razi: When the Aranara father starts feeling remorseful, should he speak more slowly, or quickly?
Tanger: That depends on the Aranara son. It would be interesting to hear them speak at different paces.
Paimon: Hey, Tanger and Razi, what's up!
Razi: Dad and I are just discussing our latest story. I'll be the one telling the story this time.
Razi: But I'm a little nervous about telling a story in front of so many people. That's why I'm asking Dad for advice.
Paimon: Ooh! Sumeru's gonna have a new young storyteller.
Tanger: If it weren't for you, Razi would surely have left me for good.
Paimon: Paimon's so glad everything worked out!
Paimon: But... there's still something that doesn't quite add up!
Collei: Oh? What is it? Do you need help investigating something?
Paimon: Why would a Mondstadter leave a note in a tree hollow back in Avidya Forest?
Collei: I-I thought we moved on from this topic! Um... it was just a coincidence!
Collei: A lot of people write down their secrets and hide them in tree hollows! It's not a big deal at all...
Traveler: Collei looks kinda flustered all of a sudden.
Collei: Ugh... Uhhh... Okay...
Collei: I might have an idea about who that Mondstadter is.
Collei: I'll tell you more about it when we get the chance.
Traveler: Sure thing.
Traveler: I look forward to that day.
Traveler: Is it really that common?
