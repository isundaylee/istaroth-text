Traveler: Hold on, about Arataki Itto...
Genta: You wanna know when Boss is getting back? Sorry, I have no idea.
Genta: What I do know is that the boss and Shinobu both see this festival as a major event, so they hope to get as many people to come as possible. That's why they're out there working hard to promote it.
Genta: They said this will improve the image of the Arataki Gang, but I wouldn't know anything about that kind of thing.
Genta: Still, I think he'll be back to see you before it's over.
Genta: After all, he respects you a lot.
Genta: Are you ready for your Drumalong performance?
