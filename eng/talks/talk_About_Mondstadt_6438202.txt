Traveler: About Mondstadt...
Gregor: Ah, Mondstadt! My beautiful homeland, where even time seems to flow more slowly...
Gregor: I got admitted into the Akademiya a few years ago, so I left Mondstadt and came here.
Gregor: That was the first time I'd been away from home. I was thrilled and nervous. I looked forward to seeing exotic landscapes while also fearing that I might not be able to live on my own...
Gregor: But after I really started my academic life here, my busy schedule has rid me of all the mixed feelings.
Gregor: Haha, I did many stupid things when I first arrived...
