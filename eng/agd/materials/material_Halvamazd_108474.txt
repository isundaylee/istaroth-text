# Halvamazd

Nahida's specialty. It is said that "mazd" means "wisdom" in Sumeru, and such delicate "wisdom" is simply irresistible. There is a gentle smile in Nahida's eyes: "The sea anemone has helped the little fish and witnessed its growth, so it's only natural for the little fish to give something back."
