Reza: Hello. I'm the Port Master of Port Ormos. Come see me or my chief secretary for any questions regarding trade.
Reza: The Dendro Archon's birthday sure has brought in whole fleets of new ships from abroad! Sure, we're really happy trade is flourishing, but it's also fertile ground for new problems to crop up...
Reza: *sigh* I shouldn't jinx things like that. After all, nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?
Reza: Speaking with the foreign merchants is most interesting, too. I've learned quite a lot.
