Traveler: What makes you say that?
Kannek: I'm not sure if it's because flying Saurians solo is all too lonesome, but all of the riders here are actually fantastic singers.
Kannek: The same goes for the letters they write. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether they're song lyrics or a love letter.
Kannek: The only letters that aren't confusing are battle reports.
Kannek: There are riders patrolling here on the regular. If you see someone flying back from Cinder City, it means I'll be dispatching a letter to the Speaker's Chamber very shortly.
