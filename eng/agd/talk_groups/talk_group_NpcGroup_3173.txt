Traveler: How's the Dango Milk doing?
Tomoki: Thanks to our Almighty Shogun, the number of people who came to buy some Dango Milk went up significantly. They all think it's pretty good, too.
Tomoki: I've given it a little thought, and given the kind of business we've been doing recently, there'd be no problem switching to just selling Dango Milk. Still, I love experimenting more...
Tomoki: I originally wanted to replace Dango Milk with some new creative dish, but my customers all missed its flavor. So after discussing it with them, I decided to return Dango Milk to the menu every so often.
Tomoki: As it turns out, it sold even better that way! Sometimes I couldn't even keep up with the demand, haha!

Traveler: Creative cuisine?
Tomoki: Heh heh, that's right! You see, this street is filled with old, famous shops that serve people the same old stuff all the time!
Tomoki: So I thought that something creative and new might attract a real crowd!
Tomoki: Aside from ordinary takoyaki and sushi, I've also added creative cuisines into the menu.
Tomoki: These are my pride and joy: Milky Natto Ramen, Colorful Spicy Dango... What do you think? Sounds delicious, no?

Traveler: How's business doing?
Tomoki: Erm... I am new to cooking, after all. It'd be best if I took things one step at a time...
Tomoki: Though my dishes may sound a little strange, everyone who's tried it has said that they taste pretty good.
Tomoki: Sir Kamisato of the Yashiro Commission visited my shop last time and took a liking to our milk tea!
Tomoki: However, perhaps the mix of foods is a little too strange, because we rarely get any returning guests. I suppose people are still too used to ordinary cuisine...
Tomoki: Seems like I need to put more work into how I promote all this creativity...

Tomoki: Eh... Failure is but a part of innovation...

## Talk 8

Tomoki: Playing cards is like cooking. If you're creative enough, you'll win for sure!

## Talk 9

Traveler: What kind of creative cuisine is that?
Tomoki: Dango Milk that's been marinated in rock, and macerated in roll â€” Rock 'n' Roll Dango Milk! Here, have one on me.
Traveler: It's just regular Dango Milk, right?
Tomoki: I wouldn't go that far! At least, it might have been to begin with, but not after hearing all that rock 'n' roll that I made it listen to.
Tomoki: That's also why it now tastes like regular Dango Milk that's been lying around for a while.
Tomoki: But this way, some customers are even willing to pay double the price of regular Dango Milk just to get their hands on this stuff.
Tomoki: Must be the power of rock 'n' roll, eh? It's so mind-blowing that I can't even put it into words.
