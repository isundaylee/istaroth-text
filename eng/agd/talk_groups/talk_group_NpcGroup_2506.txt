Fengtai: Oh sure, of course! Take your pick!

Traveler: Jadeware?
Fengtai: That is right. We do have a build-to-order jadeware service, but it requires a reservation, and the time required is based on how complicated the design is.
Fengtai: You don't choose a piece of jade, it chooses you. Chance encounters often make the best purchases.
Fengtai: So it's not a bad thing if you don't find anything you like today...

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Fengtai: Goodbye, please come again!

## Talk

Traveler: Why aren't there many jade artisans?
Fengtai: Many guests have asked the same question, as did I when I was young.
Fengtai: Deyin, my master, told me that one must suffer no distraction when carving a piece of beautiful jade.
Fengtai: If an artisan must also sell and promote, then their minds are invaded by such thoughts, and true excellence will elude their work.
Fengtai: In Chenyu Vale, the sale and production of jade are completely separate. This allows our artisans to focus on carving.
Fengtai: Who knows, there might be an artisan sequestered within any given house you might pass by, meticulously shaping the jade in their hands.
