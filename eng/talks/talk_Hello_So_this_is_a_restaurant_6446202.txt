Traveler: Hello. So this is a restaurant...
Gretchen: Yes, please feel free to rest up here for a bit.
Gretchen: As this is a lakeside restaurant, you can enjoy breathtaking views of the majestic scenery while enjoying our fine cuisine. You know, I spent quite a lot of time picking the location.
Gretchen: You may also notice that the angles at which the tables are arranged, the height and materials of the chairs have been meticulously calibrated.
Gretchen: This way, we can provide our guests with a delightful dining experience!
