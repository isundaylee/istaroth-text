## Talk

Fan Er'ye: Here for the show? Come on in and take a seat!
Fan Er'ye: Have you gone to see Ms. Yun's new opera? Ah, she truly is Liyue Harbor's superstar — there's no arguing that point!
Fan Er'ye: It's just that each time I watch her perform, I am always reminded about those things that happened in the past... *sigh*

## Talk

Traveler: About Xingyan...
Fan Er'ye: Xingyan? What? Who's that?

## Talk

Traveler: She's Yun Jin's friend...
Fan Er'ye: Oh, right, yes! I mean, I am getting on years, you know? Starting to forget and all, haha!
Fan Er'ye: Ah, but it's getting late, isn't it? My dear Xingyan might be calling it a night soon, in fact. What would you like to ask her?

## Talk

Traveler: She's your adopted daughter...
Fan Er'ye: Oh, right, yes! I mean, I am getting on years, you know? Starting to forget and all, haha!
Fan Er'ye: Ah, but it's getting late, isn't it? My dear Xingyan might be calling it a night soon, in fact. What would you like to ask her?

## Talk

Traveler: If she'd like to go see a rock 'n' roll concert.
Fan Er'ye: ...Hah, so Ms. Yun sent you.
Fan Er'ye: Ah, Ms. Yun... Whenever she wants to go out to see a rock concert, she has to find some excuse to prevent those old codgers in the troupe from finding out.
Fan Er'ye: Imagine that, eh? A man at my age, going along with various deceptions, exchanging code-words, doing things in secret...
Fan Er'ye: ...Actually, it's all rather exciting.

## Talk

Fan Er'ye: That was fantastic! What a blast...

## Talk

Traveler: Hello.
Fan Er'ye: Shh, listen to this! It's a real blast!
Traveler: Hello?
Fan Er'ye: I told you to shush! What could you possibly want that can't wait until the story is finished!?

## Talk

Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Fan Er'ye: Away with you! I don't care if the sky is falling, I'll worry about it after the story ends!
Fan Er'ye: Wait... Rex Lapis, you say?
Fan Er'ye: That's... possibly just as bad as the sky falling!
Fan Er'ye: How did you hear about this?

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye...
Fan Er'ye: Encore, encore!

## Talk

Fan Er'ye: Here for the show? Come on in and take a seat!

## Talk

Traveler: Sir, might I know your name?
Fan Er'ye: "Sir"? No need to be so polite on my account! Just call me Er'ye. Pronounced "Ah yeah!"
Fan Er'ye: I'm the boss of this tea house here. Is everything to your liking?

## Talk

Traveler: About the tea shop...
Fan Er'ye: What do you think of the place? Let me tell you something, that stage, these tables and chairs, the private rooms upstairs, the performers, the kitchen staff...
Fan Er'ye: I was the one who made it all what it is today. I paid my dues when I was young... Granny Ruoxin and I used to sing together on that stage all the time.
Fan Er'ye: Eventually I made a name for myself and saw some success. Enough to buy the place up myself. Now I run it.
Fan Er'ye: Granny Ruoxin? Hehehe, oh how times change. Put it this way, forty years ago she was no less of an acting sensation than Yun Jin is today!
Fan Er'ye: Sadly, she had her heart stolen by some adventurer in green clothing who never came back for her. Poor thing, she's had no one to rely on her whole life...
Fan Er'ye: Maybe things could have been different if I had only told her the way I felt... But I digress. No use in digging up the past.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Fan Er'ye: Won't you stay? Suit yourself, take care now!

## Talk

Fan Er'ye: Ugh, out of the way, I'm trying to listen!
Fan Er'ye: Huai'an's story is getting to the good part — the Bishui River! It's a classic tale, and this is the most iconic section!
Fan Er'ye: This year's Mingxiao Lantern was designed in honor of the protagonist; namely, Skybracer.
Fan Er'ye: You should listen too — seriously, if there's one thing you should do this Lantern Rite, this is it!
