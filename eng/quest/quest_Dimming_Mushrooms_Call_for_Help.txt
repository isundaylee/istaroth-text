# Dimming Mushroom's Call for Help


## Talk 1

Xamaran: How curious! This two-legged hatchling makes no use of her feet.
Paimon: "Two-legged hatchling"? Hmph, Paimon's got a name! And looks like someone's gonna get themselves the silliest nickname in the world ever!
Paimon: Let Paimon think... You know what, we're gonna call you "Sheeshroom"!
Paimon: Also, look at this glowing powder in the air. Are they mushroom spores? Paimon wonders if they're the reason why we could hear this mushroom talking.
Xamaran: Xamaran knows many legged ones who make no use of their feet. Yet Xamaran knows not any Paimon.
Paimon: Hehe, that's natural, because Paimon is one of a kind.
Xamaran: Xamaran knows the two-legged one over there. How strangely familiar.
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, do you know Sheeshroom?
Traveler: No, I don't.
Xamaran: Xamaran smells the heat of golden sand and the dampness from deep within the rainforest. That's the smell of Xamaran's hometown.
Paimon: Hot sand and the rainforest? Do you mean Sumeru? We did just talk to a Sumeru scholar at the camp...
Xamaran: Although Xamaran has been away from its hometown for long, Xamaran makes no mistakes.
Xamaran: #{NICKNAME} the Two-Legged, fate has brought you here. Xamaran has a favor to ask.
Xamaran: Xamaran has dwelled here for many a year and found it a cozy and comfy home...
Xamaran: Yet foul energy is growing lately. Xamaran has been drained of strength fending off the evil and has ended up in this state. Xamaran must seek help from the two-legged.
Paimon: Sheeshroom does look a little under the weather...
Paimon: #Hm... Oh right, {NICKNAME}, we can lend the energy of the Adjuvant to Sheeshroom, perhaps? Maybe that'll make it feel better.
Traveler: Maybe I do, but I don't remember.

## Talk 2

Black Screen Text: You lend the energy of the Adjuvant to Xamaran.
Paimon: Whoa! Sheeshroom is glowing. Should Paimon call it a "Shiningroom" now?
Xamaran: #Hail {NICKNAME}! Hail Paimon!
Xamaran: #Thanks to {NICKNAME}, and thanks to Paimon also! Xamaran life-light is rekindled!
Xamaran: But do not let your guard down yet. Xamaran knows that the foul energy is not yet eradicated. It could strike back at any time.
Paimon: Huh? Then what do we do!?
Paimon: Whoa! Where did all this black mud come from? Is it the "foul energy" that Sheeshroom talked about?

## Talk 3

Xamaran: #Hail {NICKNAME}! Hail Paimon!
Xamaran: None answered Xamaran's call for help. The many-legged and four-legged paid no heed, and the two-legged turned a deaf ear.
Xamaran: #Only the wise would answer. Paimon proved to be one with wisdom, and {NICKNAME} did, too.
Xamaran: You two, wisest of the two-legged, shall receive Xamaran's gratitude.
Paimon: Hmph, Paimon the Wise is not to be taken lightly!
Traveler: It was no trouble.
Xamaran: #Given time, {NICKNAME} and Paimon will rise to become as great as Xamaran and its kin. This Xamaran knows for sure.
Paimon: Hang on, what is that supposed to mean?
Xamaran: The many-legged are inferior to the four-legged, and the four-legged are inferior to the two-legged, so naturally, the two-legged are inferior to the legless.
Xamaran: #But what {NICKNAME} and Paimon lack by nature, you can make up for through hard work. You might even be able to change the course of fate one day.
Paimon: Wow, this glowing mushroom's talking super big! Paimon wonders if glowing mushrooms make good cooking ingredients...
Traveler: For Chicken-Mushroom Skewers, surely.
Traveler: Beautiful mushrooms lie. This one could be poisonous.
Xamaran: A glutton, this Paimon is. A bite on the mushroom today, another bite tomorrow, and a hundred days later, there shall be no Paimon left in Paimon, but only mushrooms.
Paimon: #Uhh, Sheeshroom's starting to talk all creepy, {NICKNAME}...
Xamaran: Ah, so you failed to see the humor in that. A shame.
Paimon: That wasn't funny at all!
Xamaran: Xamaran is cleared of the foul energy, yet its kin still suffer. Xamaran lacks the strength now to shelter the weak like it once did.
Xamaran: #Please, {NICKNAME}, Xamaran begs of you. Exercise your benevolence and save the defenseless.
Paimon: #Do you mean there are more ill mushrooms? {NICKNAME}, let's help 'em, shall we?
Traveler: Now that we're here...
Traveler: As long as it's not a big detour.
Paimon: Then let's be off!
Paimon: Whoa! Where did all this black mud come from? Is it the "foul energy" that Sheeshroom talked about?

## Talk 4

Xamaran: #Hail {NICKNAME}! Hail Paimon!
Xamaran: If Xamaran may be so bold, you Two-Legs do have a saying: "A helping hand must see things to the end."
Traveler: You mean more errand-running, huh?
Traveler: But do human sayings really apply to mushrooms?
Xamaran: Amongst Two-Legs, you two do indeed deserve the title of "The Wise."
Xamaran: We are both living beings bathing in the blessings of the earth. It's natural for us to help each other out.
Xamaran: Please take this — the Blessings of Wisdom.
Black Screen Text: You obtain the Blessings of Wisdom.
Paimon: Wow... What's this? It looks kinda suspicious, actually...
Xamaran: Xamaran can smell the lingering scent of foul energy in the air but cannot tell where its source lies. Follow the water and you shall find it.
Xamaran: #You merely need to use the Blessings of Wisdom on the source, {NICKNAME}, and Xamaran's kin will take care of the rest.
Traveler: The source of the foul energy... That's indeed something that can't be left unattended.
Traveler: ...But why don't you deal with it yourself?
Xamaran: #{NICKNAME}, you are far more humorous than Paimon. Xamaran doesn't have legs whereas you do. As one of the legless, Xamaran shan't meddle too much with the matters of the Two-Legs.
Xamaran: What's more, Xamaran has a greater duty to perform.
Traveler: A greater duty?
Xamaran: Xamaran has spent too much strength. It was a pleasant conversation with you two, but Xamaran must rest now and gather the strength to fend off evil and provide a shelter for its kin to prosper.
Xamaran: #{NICKNAME} and Paimon, may you be blessed on your journey ahead.
Xamaran: ...
Paimon: Hey, Sheeshroom! Wake up!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, looks like Sheeshroom has gone to sleep. Well, let's head off then.
Paimon: Whoa! Where did all this black mud come from? Is it the "foul energy" that Sheeshroom talked about?

## Talk 5

Xamaran: Xamaran knows that the foul energy has yet to be eradicated. Two-legged one, please lend Xamaran your strength.
Paimon: Whoa! Where did all this black mud come from? Is it the "foul energy" that Sheeshroom talked about?

## Talk 6

Xamaran: ...Ignorance might be a blessing, and knowledge might bring forth calamity...
Xamaran: ...Only that which graced with the ambrosia of knowledge can flourish into the strong...
Xamaran: ...Only that which has been tested with the desolation of wandering can brave the wilderness...

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Paimon: Hey, Sheeshroom, we're back. We've run out of your — um, what do you call it — oh, your Blessings of Wisdom.
Paimon: But we've managed to block the fissures. Now the problem has been solved!
Xamaran: #Hail {NICKNAME}! Hail Paimon!
Xamaran: May no regrets linger in the night bygone. May all shadows fade ere the dawn to come.
Xamaran: ...
Paimon: Seems Sheeshroom has fallen asleep again. Let's not disturb it.
Paimon: Whoa! Where did all this black mud come from? Is it the "foul energy" that Sheeshroom talked about?
