# The Culling of the Worms: Presentation

Vinayak: Sure enough, the charging unit is running more smoothly... As you said, the elemental environment in this area is returning to normal.
Vinayak: ...The activity of affected Wenut will calm down after some time, too.
Shriya: Yeah, yeah... Thanks to your precious Wenutslayer Cannon, we can report back our success and go home.
Vinayak: It's OUR precious Wenutslayer Cannon, Shriya. I never forgot that this assignment was a joint effort.
Vinayak: ...We definitely had our share of disagreements, but without you, the cannon wouldn't have been a success.
Shriya: What's... gotten into you? Is this about wanting me to put in a good word for you in my report?
Vinayak: Well, I just suddenly feel that what we went through just now is quite similar to our experience from that other year: it wasn't always smooth sailing, but we still made it in the end.
Vinayak: And let's face it. In the end, your solution proved more efficient.
Shriya: I... uh... I can't take all the credit...
Shriya: ...Because you were onto something, too. If you hadn't tested the Wenutslayer Cannon, I wouldn't have obtained the necessary data...
Vinayak: "To fix a machine you may only need to replace one gear, but the true challenge is finding that gear..." These words from my mentor are beginning to make sense to me.
Vinayak: I'm so glad you're here, Shriya.
Shriya: Uh... I'm glad you're here, too...
Paimon: Huh? The atmosphere between these two became so different all of a sudden...
Traveler: Paimon...
Shriya: Ahem! When we were cooperating on our graduation project, our relationship was rather rocky because we weren't very mature.
Vinayak: Yeah. Looking back on it, it wasn't anything too serious...
Shriya: Well... How about meeting at the caf√© for a drink next time? We could discuss how to write the report.
Traveler: Just leave it.
