# Final Stanza: The Sanctification of Tao Dou


## Talk 1

Xiangling: #Hey, Traveler and Paimon!
Paimon: Oh, hey Xiangling! What's up?
Xiangling: You know what's up! Our get-together, of course!
Traveler: Ah, yes, finally time for that meal.
Xiangling: Yeah! You are free, right? You are not getting out of this without a very good reason!
Paimon: We're not the ones who held it up! That was Hu Tao!
Xiangling: Yeah, tell me about it... She thinks being a director gives her a license to be a flake. It's like, unless there's a sizeable crowd coming, it's not worth my time.
Xiangling: But don't worry — we've agreed that this time, we're not gonna accept any more excuses from her.
Paimon: Oh? Who's "we"?
Xiangling: Hehe, Xingqiu and I! He said he's been wanting to invite everyone out for a long time, but given the situation with his great-grandfather, he never had the time.
Xiangling: But amazingly, on the night of the Lantern Rite, his great-grandfather suddenly woke up! Xingqiu was thrilled — and he was finally able to leave the house. So we met up right away and made a plan.
Paimon: Wow! So his great-grandfather's gonna be alright?
Xiangling: Yep! They had a doctor take a look and everything. He'll be just fine.
Xiangling: According to Xingqiu, his great-grandfather has been eating like Paimon since he woke up... so now, the family's biggest worry is that he'll get indigestion.
Paimon: Hmm... Well, that's good news, but somehow doesn't paint Paimon in the best light...
Xiangling: Don't worry, it definitely does! Your appetite represents an optimistic outlook on life: "Always eat to your heart's content, lest your chopsticks wither with regret"!
Paimon: Well said, Xiangling! Yeah, that attitude is exactly what got Paimon to where she is today!
Traveler: For real? How come I'm only hearing this for the first time?
Paimon: Yes, for real! Like Xiangling said, always eat till your heart's content, and don't let your chopsticks... um, what was it?
Xiangling: Haha, don't worry. Save it for the dinner table, Paimon!
Paimon: Hehe, no problem! But where are we gonna eat?
Xiangling: At Yilong Wharf, later tonight! Xingqiu and the others are still out there. Oh, and Hu Tao said that we'll be joined by a special guest!
Traveler: Who is it?
Xiangling: You'll see when you get there!
Paimon: Ohhh! Paimon has an idea... But, she'll keep it to herself for now.
Traveler: I have an idea, too.
Paimon: Huh? Who?
Traveler: I'm keeping it to myself, too.
Paimon: Hmph! Well, we'll see who guessed right later tonight!

## Talk 2

Chongyun: If we're talking the strongest... I'd have to pick Wind Reader. After all, he was the founding master of Qimen Divination.
Lan Yan: Yeah! He gets my vote too, being my ancestor and everything. Oh, and also the silver swallow!
Gaming: In that case, I'd have to nominate the Two Sages of Lianshan. It's always the ones who live in seclusion and never show their skill who turn out to be the most powerful of all. Well, in the books, anyway. What do you think?
Xingqiu: If this were a martial arts novel, then I'd agree with you.
Xingqiu: But unfortunately, after reading "Moonlit Bamboo Forest," I am convinced that the title should go to the White Horse of the Three Immortals of Tao Dou. She's got to be hiding some kind of secret.
Xiangling: Huh? Is no one gonna pick the Yunlai Angler? Even the Yuheng said that her sword-fighting style comes from the Yunlai Angler's rod-wielding techniques.
Gaming: Yeah, so they say... But I mean, fishing? Just seems kinda lame in this context...
Xingqiu: Hmm... Although it's more common than you might think for anglers to be more than what they seem.
Hu Tao: Hey, you're all wrong! The greatest of all were obviously Old Man Wuwang and the Lone Butterfly. Without them, there'd be no Wangsheng Funeral Parlor today.
Chongyun: Hard to argue with that.
Paimon: Oh, everyone's here already!
Hu Tao: #Traveler, Paimon, you're finally here! Welcome!
Paimon: Ah! Hu Tao, your hat!
Hu Tao: Well noticed, Paimon. Yes, I added another plum branch.
Paimon: #Ooh! So now you and Traveler have matching plum branches.
Paimon: But um, anyway, what are you all up to?
Lan Yan: We're debating who's the best out of the Eight Adepts.
Gaming: Hahaha, well kind of. An open-ended debate, maybe. We're just shooting the breeze really.
Chongyun: That's right. The only way you could settle a question like this would be with those special goggles they have in light novels, where you can read someone's power level just by looking at them.
Xiangling: Haha, has Xingqiu been getting you into light novels?
Xingqiu: #Welcome, Traveler. My family tell me that you and Hu Tao performed a very risky ceremony, and cured great-grandfather's illness in the process.
Xingqiu: I cannot thank you enough for your efforts. No matter what kind of trouble you may encounter in the future, you will always find a helping hand at the Feiyun Commerce Guild.
Traveler: It was a team effort.
Xingqiu: Yeah, I know. My father and brother will thank everyone individually in the coming days.
Hu Tao: Why go to all that trouble, Xingqiu? Save yourself the effort and just admit to me, here and now, that the strongest of the Eight Adepts are the Lone Butterfly and Old Man Wuwang! Then we'll be square.
Xiangling: Come on, enough with the debate already! Everyone's here now, so let's eat.
Xiangling: Paimon, you're up! It's time to share your grand philosophy of life with everyone.
Paimon: Uhh... O—Okay, umm... One sec... It's like, always eat to your heart's content, lest your... what was the rest, again?
Traveler: Lest your chopsticks wither in regret.
Paimon: Ahh, right, right! Yeah, that's it!
Gaming: Whoa, Paimon, you can't stumble through a motto you live by! It's bad luck! It'll make your life full of stumbling blocks too. Come on, you can do it! One more time, from the top!
Paimon: Always eat to your heart's content! Lest your chopsticks wither in regret!
Traveler: That's the spirit.
Paimon: So, is it time to dig in now?
Xiangling: Paimon, did you forget about our special guest?
Paimon: Oh, right! Paimon remembers now. Actually, Paimon guessed who it is already, but y'know, no point in saying it out loud or anything...
Hu Tao: Hmm? You don't sound confident... You don't have a clue who it is, do you?
Paimon: #Ugh, yes, actually! It's obvious who it is. It's, you-know-who, um... Traveler, a little help!
Traveler: Is it Yun Jin?
Hu Tao: Correct! It's our very own Yun Jin. So you haven't forgotten what she said last time.
Hu Tao: Look, she's taking the stage.
Lixing: Whoa! Isn't that the director of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe?
Jiewu: Amazing! I never would've expected to see her all the way out here in Yilong Wharf.
Yun Jin: Greetings, everyone.
Yun Jin: I will perform "The Sanctification of Tao Dou" one more time, for all my friends who were unable to join the festivities during the Lantern Rite. My apologies for not being able to set up a grander stage.
Paimon: Aww, that's so nice! She's doing a whole new performance for everyone who couldn't attend last time!
Hu Tao: Shh! She's about to begin.
Yun Jin: Recall the bold claims about Tao Dou
Yun Jin: Through discordant tones and tragic fates, souls of two worlds, heed my call
Yun Jin: What delusions thou hast, to set the realm flame with bones and blood
Yun Jin: Shadows of war shall fade with time, while tales of salvation will ever live on
Yun Jin: Sins must be paid once blood is spilled, the rules of life and death thou cannot confront
Yun Jin: The ways of heaven shall ever point true, while selfish desires will lead to your doom
Yun Jin: Pledges were made to vanquish evil, eight Adepts raised their blades against Tao Dou
Yun Jin: Though the body is spent and soul washed away, dreams and ways will continue always
Yun Jin: Swallows will return for a new nest, just as tears and branches will commemorate the day

## Talk 3

Xiao: #You should have gone with Traveler into the border that day.
Yelan: #I get that you care about Traveler's wellbeing. But the fact is, it wouldn't have helped. I'd have just been an extra liability if something went wrong.
Yelan: Besides, Ningguang changed the plan and sent me to The Chasm instead. I can't be in two places at once.
Yelan: If you're not happy about it, why don't you file a complaint at Yujing Terrace?
Xiao: Hmph... and report the Tianquan to the Tianquan?
Yelan: Actually, I was thinking the Yuheng. She's not afraid of a confrontation.
Xiao: ...Forget it. I'll let it go since everyone's fine.
Yelan: Heh. Wangshu Inn is a fine location...
Xiao: All of Liyue is a fine location.
Yelan: Haha, well said.
Yelan: Boss, another serving of Dew-Dipped Shrimp please, with some dipping spices.
Xiao: ...
Yelan: ...And one Almond Tofu.

## Talk 4

Beidou: Hey, the crisis is resolved. Why the long face, Tianquan?
Ningguang: #Thanks to Director Hu and Traveler, disaster was averted. But we still do not know what caused the crisis in the first place.
Ningguang: I know you are well-informed, Captain. So I trust you are aware that recently, the nation of Natlan has recently endured some major events relating to the Ley Lines and to issues of life and death.
Ningguang: It makes me wonder whether these events might somehow be connected on a deeper level.
Beidou: If they are, then this'll be bigger than just Liyue and Natlan. I'll send word to my business partners, and keep an eye out for any similar incidents in the other nations.
Beidou: Right now, though... I say, put those worries to one side and focus on enjoying these stunning sights before they disappear for another year.
Ningguang: Hehe, but of course. You don't need to teach me about work-life balance — I am no Keqing.
Beidou: Is that right? Well then, why are you still wearing that same old hairpin? Didn't I tell you to use my pay to buy yourself a new one?
Ningguang: I wouldn't dare touch Captain Beidou's Mora without final confirmation. What if you'd been speaking in jest? I'd never hear the end of it.
Beidou: Hahaha, do I really have to go pick one out for you? Alright, suits me. Let's go take a stroll through the fair.
Ningguang: Well done... When did our straight-talking Captain learn to read between the lines, hmm?
Beidou: Hahaha, that's enough. Are you coming or not?
Ningguang: Why not? Let's go.

## Talk 5

Keqing: Still working, Ganyu? Sorry it's been so busy.
Ganyu: #Huh? Oh, Keqing... No, it's fine, nothing out of the ordinary. Traveler and Director Hu are the real stars this year.
Keqing: That's no reason to diminish your own contribution. Of course they were the biggest heroes...
Keqing: But we played our part, and played it well. The Ministry of Civil Affairs responded at record speed, did we not?
Keqing: Even though on the surface, this incident looks negligible compared to the disasters of the Archon War, it was a very close call. Things could have been unimaginably worse had we not found a solution.
Ganyu: You're right... Actually, I have a question about the Seven-and-Eight-Gates Method we ended up using. How come I've never seen any records of it in the Yuehai Pavilion before?
Keqing: Oh, you want to know about the origins of the array? Ningguang made the whole thing up.
Ganyu: ...Huh?
Keqing: Haha. I'm joking.
Keqing: In truth, a letter with all the critical information suddenly appeared in Yujing Terrace on the day when we needed it. Even Yelan was unable to track down where it had come from.
Ganyu: Wait... the info just appeared out of thin air? Then... wasn't that a bit of a risky strategy on Ningguang's part...?
Keqing: It may appear that way, but if you think about it carefully, everything slowly starts to make sense...
Keqing: How many people in all of Liyue could know about both the crisis and the secret art, while also possessing the ability to deliver a letter without leaving a trace?
Ganyu: Ah... You mean... Master and her friends?
Ganyu: I see.

## Talk 6

Xianyun: That young lass from the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is rather impressive.
Xianyun: One's curiosity was piqued when Rex Lapis chose to serve as her consultant. But only now does one understand the true intent behind his decision.
Moon Carver: Agreed. And yet, what a rare delight it is to hear such effusive praise from you, Cloud Retainer.
Xianyun: "Rare"? Pray elaborate a little further.
Mountain Shaper: In the past, you may have uttered something to the tune of this: "Though the lass displays a measure of talent, it is nothing more than Shenhe or Ganyu could have achieved if placed in the same circumstances."
Xianyun: Hmph! One would never deride others as a means of praising one's own children. The Wangsheng lass displayed great determination and fortitude. Does that not make her deserving of a few words of praise?
Madame Ping: Hehehe, it certainly does. And she is not the first. I've lived in Liyue Harbor for a long time now, and I can tell you that the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor has produced generation upon generation of outstanding directors.
Moon Carver: Streetward Rambler speaks true. The god Tao Dou was not our friend, but neither was he our enemy. Had he not cared greatly for all living things, and volunteered to sanctify himself to pacify the underworld...
Moon Carver: Not even eight adepti would have been able to overpower him, much less the eight adepts. When he became the border, he likely never imagined that mortals would preserve and maintain his new form this far into the future...
Mountain Shaper: With all of that said, I realize the name of the young lady from the funeral parlor is still unknown to me.
Zhongli: The Director's surname is Hu, and her given name is Tao.
Moon Carver: Hu... Ah! As in, our word for "butterfly," yes?
Zhongli: No, Hu as in "mischief-maker."
Moon Carver: Then "Tao" must likewise be the "Tao" that means mischief in our tongue?
Zhongli: No, in fact, it is the same Tao as appears in "Tao Dou."
Mountain Shaper: Ah. So "Hu" as in butterfly, and "Tao" as in "Tao Dou." A fine name. Fitting indeed.
Xianyun: No, Hu as in "mischief-maker," "incessant pestering," and "wonton gluttony"!
Mountain Shaper: I say, I was merely trying to liven up the mood. Why is Hu Tao permitted to make mischief while I am not?
Xianyun: Hah! The clue is in the name. If you wish to change yours from Mountain Shaper to Mischief Maker, be my guest.
Madame Ping: Hehe, why not have some tea? This is the rare "Spirit Sprout" cultivar that Rex Lapis brought back all the way back from Qingce Village. It'd be a shame to miss out.
Madame Ping: May there be more good tea to share in the coming year.
Zhongli: I am sure there shall be.
