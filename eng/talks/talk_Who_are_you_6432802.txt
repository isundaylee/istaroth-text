# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Who are you?
Arezo: Oh me? I'm Arezo, and I'm... a former researcher in the Akademiya.
Arezo: My younger brother Hosseini and I both got in the Akademiya, but I just couldn't get used to that kind of life...
Arezo: My younger brother seems to like it though, so he can do as he likes.
Arezo: Anyway, I gave up the life of a researcher and returned to this place, my hometown, to lead a life of comfort without any papers or report meetings!
