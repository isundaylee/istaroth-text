Traveler: Made any discoveries?
Sayid: I was reading up on some of Mondstadt's historical myths previously. Fortunately, the library has a wealth of resources for reference.
Sayid: Of all the myths and legends in Mondstadt, the one I'm most fascinated by has to be The Legend of Vennessa.
Sayid: The spirit of freedom prized by Mondstadt must have been modeled after her courage in standing up to injustice and oppressive rulers. Even as an outsider, I am deeply moved.
Sayid: My focus has shifted to the songs of Mondstadt of late, so I'm done with this book now. Just remember to return it to the library once you've finished reading it...
