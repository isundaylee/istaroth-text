# Base Note: Auguste


## Talk 1

Edgar: *panting*... *coughing*...
Emilie: The scent... getting stronger... almost at the...
Edgar: ...Did they catch up that fast?
Edgar: No... my strength is just waning...
Edgar: ...But, it doesn't matter... This is far enough.
Edgar: Hmph...
Edgar: Ahh!
Edgar: This is... A garden of Auguste flowers?
Edgar: ...But, it's not mine... It's the one that was set on fire all those years ago in Fontaine...
Edgar: ...Yelena?
Edgar: Yelena!
Edgar: You tried to hide it from me, but I... I always understood!
Edgar: The reason why you continued to use the Delusion... The reason why you set your garden on fire... It was all because of me!
Edgar: ...I shouldn't have listened to you that day. I shouldn't have taken the Mora and ran...
Edgar: But, by the time I realized something wasn't right... there was nothing left. The flowers were gone... and so were you...
Edgar: ...I know I'm almost twenty years too late... I should have come looking for you earlier...
Edgar: I should have... I should have died with you that day...
Edgar: ...
Edgar: ...Yelena?
Edgar: —!
Edgar: Yelena!?
Edgar: ...
Edgar: No... Don't leave me... Please...
Edgar: Yelena!
Edgar: Uhhh...
Edgar: ...Emilie?
Edgar: I... I'm alive? No, that's not possible. I saw her... Yelena... We were together...
Emilie: ...No. That was an illusion, likely brought about by the residual toxin in your body coupled with the pollen in the air, neither of which are fatal.
Edgar: No, the amount of "Auguste" I drank... It should've been enough...
Traveler: I'm sorry to say this, but...
Edgar: ...A fake? But, how...
Emilie: ...We started making the preparations last night with one goal in mind.
Emilie: ...To create a perfect accord.
Edgar: ...So, you switched the bottles of "Auguste" and then lied to me about Sylvain's death...
Emilie: Convincing you that your revenge had been completed... was the easiest way to get you to let down your guard.
Edgar: Impossible... even if you found a way to switch out the bottles, there's no way you could have made an accord!
Edgar: If "Auguste" was so easy to replicate, Yelena wouldn't have...
Emilie: It was a combination of Rainbow Roses, Glaze Lilies, and Cecilias... Those ingredients would have conflicted with each other if you tried to combine them in the past.
Emilie: But recently, we found a way for them to work together.
Edgar: ...Rainbow Roses... Glaze Lilies... and Cecilias?
Emilie: ..."Auguste" was created over ten years ago. All this time, people never stopped analyzing it, never stopped trying to recreate it.
Emilie: Perfumery techniques are advancing day by day. We've found better ways to extract essential oils, separate oils and fats... we even discovered new ways to combine fragrances together.
Emilie: The mythos surrounding "Auguste" may have been untouchable almost twenty years ago... But, now, it's time for it to become a thing of the past.
Edgar: The past...
Emilie: You've been working as a perfumer for all these years... You should have always known that it is possible to make an accord, even if only in theory.
Emilie: But, the meaning you assigned to "Auguste" became so inflated, you allowed yourself to get lost in it... just like the "Perfume Mania" that captivated the public all those years ago.
Emilie: You believed in its "divinity" and "grandeur"... You believed it was entirely "one of a kind."
Traveler: And, in the process, you forgot...
Emilie: Your obsession with "Auguste" is also what allowed us to predict how you intended your plan to end... and to make preparations in advance.
Paimon: We just didn't expect it to happen so fast...
Traveler: Or that you would activate the Delusion.
Edgar: Ha... Haha...
Edgar: Well... you hit the nail on the head, now didn't you?
Edgar: So... Sylvain isn't dead...
Edgar: Since you've been preparing your accord since last night... I assume you've also figured out my method, then?
Edgar: That means the news of Sylvain's death, the crowd gathered outside the hotel this morning... It was all an act you put on with the Sheriff?
Emilie: ...Yes. If we hadn't, you might have resorted to the Delusion out of desperation, or continued to use your "Spirit Borneol" and "Auguste" combination to wreak havoc...
Edgar: Who knows... Maybe I would have just offed myself then and there.
Emilie: I know if you had things your way, you would carry the truth of "Edgar's" demise and the secrets of this garden to the grave, but I'm sorry, Master... I don't want to see any more death.
Emilie: Sylvain only inhaled a small amount of poison. He's being detained as we speak.
Emilie: All the crimes he concealed back then will be exposed in a court of law for everyone to see, and all his secrets will be revealed... The same goes for you as well.
Edgar: Is that so... Well, I suppose I'll be spending the rest of my days in a prison cell, then.
Paimon: Woah... He accepted that kinda fast...
Edgar: ...I don't feel the need to justify my actions, nor do I intend to repent for them.
Edgar: I did what I set out to do. I may have lost in the end, but it was my choice every step of the way. And if I could do it all over again...
Edgar: Hah... But, there's no going back, is there?
Collei: Be careful, everyone. This environment is dangerous, I'll lead the way...
Shyam: ...Stick close... We can't let Edgar die...
Edgar: Looks like I'm almost out of time... Although, I do have one final question, Emilie.
Emilie: ...Of course, Master.
Edgar: The combination you used to make your accord... How did you figure it out?
Emilie: ...The scent of "Auguste" is complex and varied, yet the main ingredient consists of a single variety of flower.
Emilie: So, as I was analyzing the sample yesterday, I got to thinking... What if the scent of the Auguste flower was already imbued with that complexity during its cultivation?
Edgar: You're saying... Yelena designed "Auguste" to have the scent of multiple flowers?
Emilie: Rainbow Roses, Glaze Lilies, Cecilias... The perfumers of the past knew that if you combined their essential oils directly, they would just cancel each other out. It was a conundrum they could never solve.
Emilie: But, if you cultivate a new flower species that intrinsically carries the unique features of those three scents, you can bypass that issue entirely... It goes without saying, that for the time, this idea was a stroke of genius.
Edgar: Rainbow Roses, Glaze Lilies, and Cecilias... Hah, those really do seem like flowers you would choose...
Edgar: ...Yelena.
Black Screen Text: Not long after that, the Eremites rush over...
Black Screen Text: Kirya accepts his fate without saying a word.
Traveler: That it was a bottle of perfume, nothing more.
Traveler: That was a fake.

## Talk 2

Crowd in Spirited Discussion: ...Did you know? Miss Emilie's releasing a new perfume!
Crowd in Spirited Discussion: Ah, right! I heard about that! I think it's called... "Yelena"...
Paimon: ...Seems like everyone in Fontaine is talking about the new perfume you're releasing!
Emilie: I was hoping to release it without such a fuss, but... the news spread way faster than I expected.
Emilie: I just hope it won't become the source of some new "myth"... especially after all the work we did to demystify "Auguste."
Traveler: About this perfume...
Emilie: I did! Although, I made a few modifications to the formula to make the scent more pleasant and long-lasting... I actually brought a few samples with me today. I hope they're to your liking.
Emilie: Also... I was hoping you could try out the fragrance before I officially release it, and tell me your thoughts.
Paimon: Of course! A good sense of taste and sense of smell go hand in hand, you know. Just leave it to Paimon!
Paimon: ...*sniff* Ooh, it smells great!
Traveler: I'm not sure that's the kind of feedback she had in mind...
Emilie: Haha, it's alright. All feedback is worth considering.
Emilie: Besides, when it comes to perfume... commenting on whether it smells good is the most straightforward assessment you can ask for. There doesn't always have to be a deeper meaning.
Traveler: Speaking of deeper meanings... Kirya's final question...
Paimon: Right... Do those flowers have some special meaning? Hearing their names seemed to have an effect on him...
Emilie: Hm, if I had to guess... I'd say it probably has something to do with the language of flowers.
Paimon: The language of flowers? Oh, we've heard of that before. Paimon remembers hearing something like... the "Cecilia" represents "the true feelings of the prodigal son"...
Emilie: What each flower is said to represent varies by person and across different moments in history... the same is true for the flowers that make up the scent of Auguste.
Emilie: After returning to Fontaine, I did some research... and it turns out, the meanings of those three flowers can be reassembled to form a single phrase...
Emilie: "...Forget the past, and keep on living."
Emilie: Perhaps that's the legacy Yelena always intended, not the nobility and grandeur most people associate with Auguste.
Traveler: Or maybe... That's what she hoped for her brother...
Paimon: Do you think Kirya knew about that?
Emilie: I paid him a visit before his trial and explained what I found... But, he didn't seem to care.
Emilie: "Who knows? Maybe she didn't mean anything by it at all?" — that was his response.
Emilie: "...Yelena is gone. We'll never know what she was thinking. We can look for meaning all we want, but it'll never be anything but conjecture."
Emilie: "Even if that is what she was trying to say, I would never be able to forget her."
Emilie: "...Avenging her death... That was the meaning I chose for my life."
Emilie: ...Kirya cultivated his revenge like a flower. He was commited to making it bloom, even if, in the end, it didn't bear the fruit he was hoping for...
Traveler: ...Kirya.
Emilie: In any case, he did want me to pass along his thanks.
Emilie: "...Thank you for saving my life, for giving me the chance to learn that Auguste... could have carried a very different meaning."
Traveler: ...
Emilie: Love and hatred are a privilege of the living.
Emilie: When someone dies, their thoughts, feelings, and intentions die with them. In that sense, what Auguste truly represents in the language of flowers will forever remain a mystery.
Emilie: But... even if it's only a conjecture, I would like to believe my own interpretation.
Emilie: The meaning we give to flowers, the symbolism we assign to our perfumes... They're constantly twisted and exploited in our imperfect world...
Emilie: And yet, at the very outset, they're born from the simplest and most beautiful desires we hold in our heart.
Traveler: Did you use the accord from back in Sumeru?

## Talk 3

Traveler: (We need to hurry. Now is not the time to wander.)

## Talk 4

Berbere: How could something like that happen in broad daylight...

## Talk 5

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): From today until the end of the exhibition, the hotel and surrounding buildings have been temporarily rented out by the exhibitor, and are not accepting outside guests at this time. We apologize for any inconvenience.

## Talk 8

Innam: The shadow-like figure ran in the direction of the elevator, and my partner immediately chased after them...
Emilie: ...We should hurry, before they're forced to confront each other.

## Talk 9

Paimon: Where in the world did he go... Oh, let's ask the merchants nearby!

## Talk 10

Emilie: The scent is getting stronger. This must be the place.

## Talk 11

Innam: Ah! Oguz!
Innam: Are you alright? W—Were you attacked?
Oguz: Argh... No, no... I'm alright. I was just chasing after that figure, and then, all of a sudden, I didn't feel so hot...
Emilie: Let me take a look.
Paimon: The air definitely feels heavy... It smells nice, but for some reason, it's hard to breathe...
Collei: This feeling... I've encountered it before...
Emilie: Everything looks alright. It was probably just the stress of the chase combined with the impact of the environment. A bit of rest would do you some good.
Oguz: I can't rest! Mr. Edgar is still in there! He taught my sister how to make perfume...
Oguz: He's a good man... I can't just abandon him to die by Kirya's hand!
Shyam: Oguz... You need to calm down and listen to me. Edgar is the one we're after. He and Kirya are the same person.
Oguz: But... How is that possible!? I thought you said Kirya was in his thirties?
Oguz: Mr. Edgar is seventy something... Changing your appearance to look decades older... That doesn't seem possible!
Emilie: That's precisely why he had to resort to extraordinary measures to age himself.
Traveler: ...A Delusion.
Emilie: Kirya used a Delusion to bring back the Auguste flower, corroding his body in the process... just like his older sister.
Oguz: No... He couldn't have. Mr. Edgar has been in Port Ormos for years! If someone started impersonating him all of a sudden, we would have noticed!
Emilie: And what if the impersonation started before he ever set foot in Sumeru?
Oguz: I... Uh...
Emilie: ...I've yet to confirm it, but I suspect Kirya killed the real Edgar in Fontaine not long after his release from prison.
Emilie: While Edgar was incarcerated, Kirya started making preparations to replace him, including forcefully aging his body, studying perfumery... and planning the real Edgar's demise.
Emilie: The new "Edgar" then decided to relocate to Sumeru, seemingly out of an innocuous desire to let go of the past. He even left perfume-making in favor of mentoring students... But, these decisions were all for a specific purpose... the need to distance himself from anyone who might see through the facade.
Emilie: And Sumeru fit the bill to a tee. With no one around to question his identity, all he had to do was grow a beard, don a pair of glasses, make a few minor alterations to his appearance... and everyone would believe he was exactly who he claimed — Edgar, a perfumer from Fontaine.
Emilie: As the years went by, he removed his disguise little by little and continued to refine his skills... It would have been a gradual process, one that ensured no one around him would notice anything unusual.
Paimon: That explains why Sylvain said he barely recognized Edgar back at the hotel...
Paimon: He aged himself decades beyond his years just so he could accomplish his revenge... Is that even worth it?
Oguz: I... I need to find Mr. Edgar... He's not that kind of person, he can't be... *coughing*
Shyam: What you really need is to get out of here and rest!
Oguz: No, I... I can keep going!
Collei: Wait... This environment is likely being influenced by the Delusion. Any discomfort, no matter how slight, should not be treated lightly.
Collei: I know how to relieve your symptoms, Mr. Oguz... Please, come with me and rest.
Collei: I'm sure Kirya... No, Edgar wouldn't want any more innocent people implicated in all this.
Emilie: #Collei's right. Traveler and I will take things from here. From our brief exposure to "Auguste," it would seem the substance has little effect on us...
Emilie: This leads me to believe those blessed with a Vision or capable of wielding elemental power are more resistant to the effects of abnormal elemental energy. In other words, this environment doesn't pose as much of a risk to us.
Emilie: Actually, now that I think about it, this stronghold likely has multiple points of entry. If the target were to escape from a different point of entry, that might allow him to evade capture...
Emilie: ...I hate to trouble you, but we need people to survey the perimeter...
Oguz: I...
Shyam: Heh... Thanks.
Shyam: ...Hear that? We're heading out! There's work to be done! Oguz, head back to Port Ormos and start gathering reinforcements!
Oguz: Got it...
Collei: #Traveler, Emilie, Paimon... Please, be careful.
Collei: For someone whose only purpose in life is revenge, there's no telling what they'll do when there's no reason to move forward.
Emilie: Don't worry. This isn't the end, not for us... or for Kirya.
Emilie: ...We're not going to let "Auguste" kill anyone else. It's time for the mythos to fade into obscurity.

## Talk 12

Paimon: Woah... Look at all the Auguste flowers...
Paimon: There are so many of them... Paimon can't believe a single person did all this! It must've taken a lot of time...
Emilie: I fear that statement is truer than you know, Paimon. Using a Delusion comes at a cost... not just time, but the time you have left to live...
Paimon: But, why would Kirya need this many Auguste flowers?
Paimon: He only needed a few bottles of "Auguste" to carry out his plan, right?
Emilie: ...Perhaps hatred wasn't the only emotion fueling his obsession with "Auguste."
Traveler: ...What do you mean?
Emilie: Not long ago, he told me he didn't want all the flowers transported to Sumeru to wither away in a foreign land.
Emilie: But, Kirya betrayed Snezhnaya, abandoned Fontaine, and lived his entire life in Sumeru under the guise of someone else...
Emilie: For someone with nowhere to call home... Perhaps dying among a bed of Auguste flowers, just like his sister, is the best homecoming he could ask for.
