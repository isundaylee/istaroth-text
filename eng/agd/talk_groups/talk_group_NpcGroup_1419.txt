Traveler: Tell me, are there any events happening as of late?
Sara: There happens to be a salad tasting event ongoing now.
Sara: Here you go. If you like it, you can always visit me again.

## Talk 1

Sara: Welcome to Good Hunter. How can I help you?

### Talk 1 related talk 0

Traveler: Can you just tell me what's in this dish?
Sara: No! Gifts are supposed to be surprises, I can't be telling you that.
Sara: If you must know, you can always ask Jilliana.
Sara: Though I'm quite certain she won't tell you either.

### Talk 1 related talk 1

Traveler: So, Rudolf wants to give Jilliana a present...
Sara: Rudolf wants to do that? But if you've come to me... Do you mean to order some specialties?
Sara: Other than specialties, you won't find anything special here.
Sara: Alright, I can whip something up for you if you insist...
Sara: Well, then I'll get to it. In the meantime, could you help me deliver Norma's order to her?
Sara: It's best eaten hot, so you'll have to hurry before it cools.
Traveler: Got it.
Sara: Thanks a lot! Off you go.
Traveler: I'm heading out, then.
Sara: Yup, thanks!

### Talk 1 related talk 2

Traveler: We've delivered the meal.
Sara: You have? Great! That dish gets cold easily, and once it does, it's no longer good.
Sara: I've also finished the specialty dish you ordered for Jilliana. Hehe, since we're both ladies, I'm sure she'll like it. Once she sees it, she'll probably also understand what I...
Sara: Alright, go give it to them. There's no rush to deliver this while it's hot. Perhaps you could even say that now isn't the time to eat it...
Sara: Hmm, how should I put this? When you want to eat it, you just need to warm it up a bit. As to the "when," we can leave that up to Jilliana.
Sara: Oh — and don't steal any bites, I haven't the time to make another serving!

### Talk 1 related talk 3

Traveler: The dish has gone cold...
Sara: Ugh, this dish has already gone totally cold.
Sara: Guess there's no choice but to make another serving... Please make haste this time around.
Traveler: Understood.
Sara: It's done. Come now, there's no time to lose.

### Talk 1 related talk 4

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Sara: That's correct. You're here to help, right? Then you're right on time — I'd just finished making this Mondstadt Hash Brown.
Sara: It's supposed to go to Silio. He paid us earlier, and said that he'd be waiting for his delivery near Stormbearer Point.

### Talk 1 related talk 5

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Sara: Yup, you've come at just the right moment — I'd just finished preparing this Sweet Madame.
Sara: Wallit ordered it earlier, and requested that we deliver it to a location west of the Dawn Winery later in the day...
Sara: If you don't mind helping us out, could you take his order to him real quick?

### Talk 1 related talk 6

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Sara: Right, I believe a certain... Angelo ordered — and paid for — a serving of our Flaming Red Bolognese.
Sara: After that, he asked that we deliver it to him near Brightcrown Canyon. But that's some distance away, and I don't have anyone I can send there...
Sara: If you're alright with it, could you help us deliver it to him?

### Talk 1 related talk 7

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Sara: That's right. Great timing, Traveler! Wallit ordered a stack of Tea Break Pancakes from us earlier. Don't worry, he's already paid beforehand.
Sara: He wants us to bring it to a place south of Brightcrown Canyon...
Sara: But we've been getting more and more take-out orders lately for some reason, and we can barely keep up.
Sara: If you don't mind, could you help us with this delivery?

### Talk 1 related talk 8

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Sara: Well, here's what happened. Silio ordered a serving of Mondstadt Hash Brown, and said that he'd like it delivered around this time.
Sara: This hash brown is particularly fragile. If you shake it too much, it might fall apart. *Please deliver it in time* so that it can maintain its crumbly mouthfeel.
Sara: If something happens to you out there, please bring that serving back, and I'll prepare a new one for you.

### Talk 1 related talk 9

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Sara: That's right. Silio ordered another serving of Mondstadt Grilled Fish today before heading to Stormterror's Lair. Could you help us and deliver this to him real quick?
Sara: This serving of Mondstadt Grilled Fish *can't come into contact with any strange elements*, or it might end up tasting funny.

### Talk 1 related talk 10

Traveler: I heard that someone placed a custom order...
Sara: Yup, Wallit ordered some Fisherman's Toast today before heading off to the Stone Gate on the border between Mondstadt and Liyue.
Sara: Really, though, who orders take-out for finger food?

### Talk 1 related talk 11

Traveler: Do you sell any Mondstadt specialties?
Sara: Mondstadt's specialties? What can I say, every last one of our dishes is unique to Mondstadt.
Sara: However, most of them have a short shelf life, and are by no means convenient items to bring on a long trip.
Sara: We can of course cook them differently to make them more suitable for travel and storage, but it comes at a significant compromise in taste and quality.
Traveler: Doesn't bother me.
Sara: Alright then, if you insist.
Sara: But if this is intended as a gift, I'd advise you to cook a fresh batch of whatever you choose — everything here has been sat out for a while.
Sara: Might I ask where your friend is from? Perhaps I can make a recommendation.
Traveler: Snezhnaya.
Sara: Wow, that's a long way from here. I need to be careful with my choice of ingredients.
Sara: Hmm, I know nothing of Snezhnayan tastes, but I do know a dish that caters to all tastes.
Sara: Make me a Satisfying Salad and I will process it for you to make it more durable.
Sara: Huh, you know something, I can't actually remember the last time I had to get the tools for this job out of the cupboard.
Traveler: The Fatui.
Sara: The F—Fatui? You mean the ones from Snezhnaya? ...Your social circle is broad, to put it mildly.

### Talk 1 related talk 12

Traveler: About the specialty dish...
Sara: How's the Satisfying Salad coming along? I'm ready when you are, just bring it right here when it's done.

### Talk 1 related talk 13

Sara: Order for delivery
Sara: Welcome to Good Hunter— Oh, hello Traveler! You've come just at the right time.
Sara: Sorry, I know you must be hungry, but could you do something for me?
Sara: Miss Orlean from Springvale ordered a *Sticky Honey Roast*, but I hear Springvale's crawling with slimes these days...
Sara: I don't dare attempt the journey myself... Could you deliver this order to *Orlean in Springvale* for me?
Traveler: I guess, but...
Sara: Rest assured there'll be a hearty meal waiting for you on your return!
Sara: I'm counting on you!
Traveler: I only came here to eat; I'm starving!
Sara: Once you've done what I ask, I'll treat you to something from the Good Hunter special menu! Much obliged.

### Talk 1 related talk 14

Sara: Deliver meal fee
Sara: You're back! Did the delivery go okay?
Traveler: Here's the fee.
Sara: Let me check... Yep! Thanks!
Sara: Here, this *Delicious Crab, Ham & Veggie Bake* is for you. It's fresh out of the oven, eat it while it's hot.

### Talk 1 related talk 15

Sara: Order for delivery
Sara: Hey, Traveler! What's happening—
Sara: ...Oh, you're just here to eat, you say?
Sara: I understand, really I do... But I promise you I will make you the best meal you ever tasted if you just lend me a hand first.
Sara: Ernest from the Dawn Winery often orders food from here to pair with his wine, and his orders always come with special requests.
Sara: This time he wants *Fried Radish Balls* but with egg added in. Unfortunately, I'm fresh out of eggs!
Sara: So if you could just go ahead and grab me a couple of Bird Eggs, that would be great.
Traveler: If you insist...
Sara: There must be plenty of Bird Eggs around Windrise.
Sara: I appreciate it!
Traveler: I only came here to eat; I'm starving!
Sara: There must be plenty of Bird Eggs around Windrise.
Sara: Once you've done what I ask, I'll treat you to something from the Good Hunter special menu! Much obliged.

### Talk 1 related talk 16

Traveler: I come bearing ingredients.
Sara: That'll do it. One moment...
Sara: It's ready! Now, get these *Fried Radish Balls* to Ernest, pronto!
Sara: ...Don't give me that look, I know you're famished.
Sara: There'll be a special Good Hunter surprise waiting for you when you get back!

### Talk 1 related talk 17

Sara: Deliver meal fee
Sara: You're back! Did you make the delivery?
Traveler: Here's the fee.
Sara: Let's see... Excellent! Thank you.
Sara: Here, this *Crab, Ham & Veggie Bake* is for you. It's fresh out of the oven, eat it while it's hot.

### Talk 1 related talk 18

Sara: Order for delivery
Sara: Traveler! Perfect timing...
Sara: Sorry, I know you must be hungry, but could you do something for me?
Sara: There's been a steady increase in volume of delivery orders recently. I tend to divide them up by region and then label each dish with the name of the person who ordered it.
Sara: But I've lost the label for this *Calla Lily Seafood Soup*. All I know is that it's for someone in Springvale.
Sara: Could you take this *Calla Lily Seafood Soup* over to Springvale for me and find out who ordered it?
Traveler: I guess, but...
Sara: Rest assured there'll be a hearty meal waiting for you on your return!
Sara: I'm counting on you!
Traveler: I only came here to eat; I'm starving!
Sara: Once you've done what I ask, I'll treat you to something from the Good Hunter special menu! Much obliged.

Sara: Let me check... Perfect! Thanks!
Sara: Here, this *Crab, Ham & Veggie Bake* is for you. It's fresh out of the oven, eat it while it's hot.

### Talk 1 related talk 20

Sara: Chirp chirp, I have a letter for you.
Sara: Oh! I never expected you to be the one delivering this!
Sara: I thought it would be a carrier pigeon, like usual.
Sara: But as long as it's delivered I'm happy. Thanks!

### Talk 1 related talk 21

Sara: I'm trying to find out about the "Darknight Hero."
Sara: I think I've heard customers talk about that.
Sara: But I don't tend to listen in on their conversations, so I'm afraid I know nothing.

### Talk 1 related talk 22

Traveler: Regarding Lisa's taste in food...
Sara: What does Lisa like to eat?
Sara: She's been here a few times with Master Jean for afternoon tea before. I think she normally orders *something vegetarian*.
Sara: A lady tends to eat cautiously on account of her physique, after all! On that note, I should probably be watching my own diet a little more...

### Talk 1 related talk 23

Sara: Can I get food to-go?
Sara: Certainly. Here's the menu.

### Talk 1 related talk 24

Traveler: About Stormterror...
Sara: *sigh* Business has really taken a turn for the worse ever since Stormterror appeared. Nobody's in the mood to eat.
Sara: Even those customers who do show up do nothing but sigh and moan...
Sara: But I suppose that's normal. I just hope that all this will be over soon.
