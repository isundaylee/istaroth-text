Hot Spring Notice: "Please take note of the following before entering the hot springs."
Hot Spring Notice: "First, pick the right pool, and watch the water temperature, or you might get scalded. Travelers from abroad should get acclimated to an artificial pool first before trying any natural ones!"
Hot Spring Notice: "Next up, no playing around in the hot springs. Not only will this disturb others, but you might also slip and fall."
Hot Spring Notice: "Last of all, know your limits. Don't be afraid to step out should you feel uncomfortable, and don't forget to drink water and eat some food to keep your stamina up."
Energetic Handwriting: "And remember kids, don't pour milk into the hot springs, and don't throw stones in either! Big Sis Mualani's gonna be mad otherwise!"
