## Talk 1

Aragita: It's Aranara's friend! Good Nara, want to play with Aragita?

## Talk 2

Traveler: Sure. What are we playing?
Aragita: Under the wooden chests there are not only lizards but also other things. Nara shall remember the position of the <color=#00E1FFFF>pile of leaves</color>.
Traveler: That's trivial. Let's get started.

## Talk 3

Traveler: The timing isn't right.
Aragita: Aragita won't rush. Will wait for the "right timing."

## Talk 4

Aragita: Grass and trees remember, so does Nara. Nara is Aranara's friend, and the friend of grass and trees, too.

## Talk 5

Aragita: Nara got it wrong, but it doesn't matter. There is a lot of "next time." Any time playing with Nara is "the right time" for Aragita.
