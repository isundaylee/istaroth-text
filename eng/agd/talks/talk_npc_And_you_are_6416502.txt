Traveler: And you are...
Behaim: I am... *sigh* I don't remember. Guess I am just a graybeard drifting in the wind.
Behaim: When I was a young lad, I met a girl from Sumeru in a place where the wind blew.
Behaim: Who would have thought that this girl, beautiful as a flower in the spring, was the captain of a merchant fleet!
Behaim: I was mesmerized by her, and followed her to the home of trees and flowers. I lived a life that was more delightful than in the most romantic poetry.
Behaim: Now she is gone like a spring flower in the wind... and I'm still here.
