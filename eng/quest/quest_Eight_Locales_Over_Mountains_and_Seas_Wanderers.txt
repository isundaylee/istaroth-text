# Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas: Wanderer's Appraisal


## Talk 1

"Kichiboushi": This city is very big, but... feels grim.
Paimon: We came here before with a lot of companions, and we fought a battle against Stormterror.
"Kichiboushi": Is Stormterror a large, sharp-tooth, scary dragon with flip-flap wings?
Traveler: Well, he wasn't that scary.
Paimon: Do you still remember that Anemo Archon statue we saw in Mondstadt?
"Kichiboushi": Anemo Archon Statue...?
Paimon: That big, tall stone statue.
"Kichiboushi": Mm! Yes! Anemo Archon had big hands!
Paimon: Stormterror is the archon's good friend! Long ago, the Anemo Archon was from this city, too...
"Kichiboushi": Ooh!
"Kichiboushi": But if Storm-Storm is so big, how does he get in here?
Traveler: You know, this question feels familiar...
Paimon: Paimon knows this one! That's because he doesn't walk in...
"Kichiboushi": Ooh, Kichiboushi knows. Storm-Storm can fly. Does not need walking.
Paimon: A—Argh! How...
"Kichiboushi": Mm? Paimon, you seem a little unhappiness.
Paimon: Eh... We can talk about that later. First off, let's take a photo! Alright, stand still now!
"Kichiboushi": Kichiboushi stand straight!
Traveler: It's "Stormterror."
Traveler: He was quite lovely, actually.

## Talk 2

"Kichiboushi": Mm... Very nice...
Paimon: What's wrong, Kichiboushi?
"Kichiboushi": This is a grim city. Very sad, don't know why. Strange.
Traveler: I feel the same way.
Paimon: Next up, let's head into the center of this "city"...
Traveler: That's rather odd, Kichiboushi.

## Talk 3

"Kichiboushi": Mmmph! The wind... strong...
Paimon: We can't pass through these storm-walls. We've got to go around!
Paimon: Easy now, Kichiboushi, just follow us around.

## Talk 4

Paimon: We're finally here!
Paimon: The view's much better up here. Look over there — that's the spot where we came from!
"Kichiboushi": Paimon likes high spots, mm?
Traveler: You can see everything from these vantage points, and they are good for gliding, too.
"Kichiboushi": Does Storm-Storm sleep here?
Paimon: Yup — for a really long time, too.
Paimon: #Even though {NICKNAME} fought Stormterror, he's not a bad dragon.
Paimon: He just experienced something terrible, got hurt, and was tricked by bad people, so he thought that his friend, the Anemo Archon, no longer needed him.
"Kichiboushi": Mm... Then what happened?
Paimon: #After that, huh? Do you remember, {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: I purified his poisoned blood during our battle.
Paimon: But the platform we were battling on collapsed. At first, it looked like we and the Anemo Archon were going to fall into a deep, dark place...
"Kichiboushi": Eek! That's horrible... What did you do? Did you fly away?
Traveler: Dvalin saved us, and he bore us away.
"Kichiboushi": Dva...?
Paimon: That's Stormterror's name.
Paimon: #Stormterror actually had a name of his own, just like Kichiboushi, Paimon, and {NICKNAME} — and his name is Dvalin.
Paimon: At first, Dvalin was injured and tricked by some bad people, so he was very angry. That's why he attacked Mondstadt, and because everyone thought he was a bad dragon, they called him "Stormterror."
Paimon: Later, we beat those bad people and helped the Anemo Archon purify the blood that was tainting him. That was when he realized that the archon hadn't abandoned him.
"Kichiboushi": Ooh! So Storm-Storm became good again!
Paimon: Exactly! And that's why Paimon brought you here for training today — it was to tell you the story of Dvalin.
Paimon: When you grow older, you will also be misunderstood, get hurt, and experience sad things.
Paimon: But you mustn't become a bad person. Because "winds change their course"...
Traveler: And someday, they will blow towards a brighter future...
"Kichiboushi": Mm?
Traveler: Was that a bit tough to understand, Kichiboushi?
"Kichiboushi": Understand, but also not really...
"Kichiboushi": #But Kichiboushi knows that it is something important. Will not forgetting what Paimon and {NICKNAME} say.
Paimon: Hehe! Then at least our long storytelling session didn't go to waste!
Paimon: But whatever the case, make sure you don't become too playful or cheeky — that might get you sealed sometime in the future!
Traveler: Looks like this round of your training has drawn to a close.
"Kichiboushi": Mmmm...
Paimon: There's no need to be so sad! Smile as we go back, or you'll make Ioroi sad, too!
Paimon: Alright then. Guess we've gotta do our jobs as guides one last time, eh?
Paimon: Now then — time to bring Kichiboushi back to Ioroi!
Traveler: Let's move out.
"Kichiboushi": Mm.
Traveler: Let's go, Kichiboushi.
Traveler: Seems like we've completed Ioroi's commission.
Traveler: Stormterror saved us and bore us away from the battle.
Traveler: You know what they say about "idiots and smoke..."
Paimon: That's not what this is about! You can see everything from up here, and the air is great, too.

## Talk 5

Paimon: We're back, Ioroi!
Ioroi: Ooh, you've finally returned! How has Kichiboushi's training gone?
"Kichiboushi": Squelch squelch, kapow!
Ioroi: Mmhahaha! Good, good!
Paimon: Oh brother, we can't understand Kichiboushi anymore...
Paimon: We even took a lot of photos. Have a look, Ioroi...
Black Screen Text: You show all the photos you took for Kichiboushi during this time to Ioroi.\nYou also tell him about your adventures.
Paimon: ...And that's how we completed your request to "take Kichiboushi to eight places to train," Ioroi.
Ioroi: Mm! Good, very good, as might be expected of humans I had mine eye on. If you were also tanuki, you would be great and renowned indeed. Perhaps half as great as I when put together!
Paimon: (That's not super impressive...)
Paimon: But since we've completed the task, we should probably leave now.
"Kichiboushi": Mmmph...
Paimon: Oh, don't be like that. Come on, Kichiboushi, Paimon's gonna teach you one more thing!
Paimon: When you say goodbye to friends, you should see them off with a smile! That way, you'll be even happier when you meet again.
Ioroi: ...Mm? Alright. Sure. Leave it to me.
Ioroi: Kichiboushi says, "Got it, White Fur."
Paimon: Eh? Does this mean...
Traveler: Kichiboushi's lost his ability to speak?
Ioroi: It has been some time. The effects of the tanuki meal must have worn off.
Ioroi: Hmph! If I were free from this stone seal, it would be a thing of ease to have you understand tanuki speech all the time...
Ioroi: ...Hmm? Of course, I will pass it on.
Ioroi: "Kichiboushi train hard."
Ioroi: "Become strong bake-danuki, like Ioroi!"
Ioroi: Mm? Hahaha! That's quite the boast, you little rascal. Reminds me of myself when I was your age!
Ioroi: "Then White Fur and Yellow Fur no eat bake-danuki food, understand Kichiboushi."
Paimon: We'll be waiting, Kichiboushi! We'll come train with you next time, too.
Traveler: Good luck, Kichiboushi.
Traveler: Don't get sealed by humans, now.
Ioroi: Mm!?
"Kichiboushi": Mm!
Ioroi: Eh, forget it. I shall not pursue the matter, considering that you did take Kichiboushi out to train.
Ioroi: Ah, yes. There was once this fellow called Utamarou who painted the tanuki sealed in Chinju Forest and left some drafts behind.
Ioroi: You can have it, to look upon whenever you wish to remember the handsome forms of the tanuki race!
Ioroi: *sigh* If only you, too, were tanuki...
Traveler: Wouldn't we have been turned into stone already, then?
Ioroi: Mmph, true. Well then, off you go now. I have a little magic to teach Kichiboushi.
Traveler: We've lost the ability to understand Kichiboushi's speech?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Ioroi: Ooh, it's you. I must confess that this Kimera of yours is very impressive indeed. A true shame it is that you are not a tanuki, or you would be a most great one indeed.
Ioroi: Well, perhaps only half as great as me, though.
Traveler: About scents...
Ioroi: When you first came here, you were aided by a certain someone giving you a bake-danuki meal, yes?
Ioroi: We bake-danuki are skilled at transforming into just about anything. Back when I was competing with that sneaky kitsune, I once transformed myself into Hanamizaka — yes, the whole street! She saw through me, though.
Ioroi: The people of that time knew this as the False Hanamizaka Incident, and even wrote it into a text known as "Kakushin Oobayashi." It should be a most famous tale... Do people nowadays no longer know of it?
Ioroi: Whatever the case, we are too skilled at transforming, and so must rely on scents — auras — to identify each other. There might be cases of mistaken identity otherwise.
Ioroi: That's why I said, how could it not have been that sneaky kitsune who made that meal for you? To be so familiar with us tanuki and even know our magic... There are precious few who can do such things!
Traveler: About training...
Ioroi: When I was around Kichiboushi's age, I traced the footsteps of the great bake-danuki Tsukumo across eighteen famous sites — it was in those places that he showed forth the might of the tanuki, once upon a time.
Ioroi: For example, it is said that he once turned into a festive float team on the path of pilgrimage up Mt. Yougou, singing and dancing as he went. He even transformed himself into Her Excellency. Ah, that was quite the story!
Ioroi: As for the other sites... Tsukumo once transformed into the mighty ancient general, Akuou, at the Mouun Shrine. He called for this shrine maiden... whatever her name was... to come out and see him, making trouble everywhere.
Ioroi: Whatever the case, the little tanuki must not stray from our path — they must train hard to become strong and independent big bake-danuki!
Ioroi: See you.
Ioroi: Take care of yourselves. I leave Kichiboushi in your hands.
