Souka: The Guest of Tenshukaku, the Slayer of Three Thousand Bandits in Seven Days, the Twin Stars of Brilliant Valor, the Great Bosses of Gold and Silver...
Souka: I had a great time talking and playing games with you. Hehe, I always get lots of inspiration whenever we hang out!
Traveler: Two more games, then!
Souka: It shall be my honor!
Traveler: Looks like you're gathering your thoughts. I'll leave you to it, then.
Souka: No need to be shy. If you wanna have a chat or play a game or two, come and find me whenever you're free.
