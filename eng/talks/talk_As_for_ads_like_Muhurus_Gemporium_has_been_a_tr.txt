Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "As for ads like 'Muhuru's Gemporium has been a trusted seller for over a century, guaranteed genuine or get 10 times your money back'... We have no need for them."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "As the previous manager said: 'If our store sells a single fake or even anything low-quality, then feel free to take a hammer and smash every single gem we've got!'"
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Anyway, if you've already found a great gem, we offer polishing and cutting services. We'll process the gem any way you like, in any style you want."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): "Just don't ask us to 'carve it into the shape of a Grainfruit' or something like that. Anything else is fine!"
