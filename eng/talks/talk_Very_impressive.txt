Traveler: Very impressive.
Cheven: I feel the same way.
Cheven: Still, I find that practice a bit too avant garde. The way I look at it, if you want to customize your tools, engraving two or three stones is more than enough.
Cheven: Ah, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Cheven, the owner of Muhuru's Gemporium. I'm a jeweler by trade, but I know how to make weapons too.
Cheven: Most of the weapons I make are in the traditional style. They've been proven to be reliable and easy to wield.
Cheven: If you'd like to check out some newer styles, you can try your luck with Xilonen. She's not always around, though â€” you might have to check every tree in Natlan to find her sunbathing spot.
