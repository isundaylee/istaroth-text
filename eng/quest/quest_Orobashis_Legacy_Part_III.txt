### Additional Talk 1

Observe: The strange stone lantern seems to emit an ominous energy.
Paimon: Is this... a stone lantern? Why is there a stone lantern here?
Paimon: Well, someone's written something on the lamp post. Shall we go have a look?
Observe: "Fellow workers, if you have any questions about this ward, please go to the Musoujin Gorge and talk to Mr. Kaji."
Observe: The handwriting looks new. There are a few small rough lines of writing below:
Observe: "I'm sorry, but we can't help you either. We just received evacuation orders from the commissioner yesterday.
Observe: "I hope I can see you again someday and discuss how to solve our Tatarigami problem."
Paimon: This Mr. Kaji seems to be pretty concerned about these stone lanterns. Why don't we go to Musoujin Gorge and ask him?

### Additional Talk 2
