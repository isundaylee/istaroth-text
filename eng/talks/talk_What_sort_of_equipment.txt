Traveler: What sort of equipment?
Ahoeitu: Ah, I'm talking about clothes and tools that can withstand very high temperatures. Our tribespeople need them to conduct regular inspections deep within the volcano.
Ahoeitu: Koholasaurs are the only Saurians here that can traverse molten lava, so it falls on us to monitor the activities of the volcano.
Ahoeitu: The volcano has always been known for accidents and mishaps, and remains a vulnerable spot for monster attacks. They could come in from both inside and out, so it's the least we can do to keep a close eye on it.
