## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Elzer: If our winery's business remains closed for any longer, how will I face Master Diluc...
Elzer: Traveler, if you meet Master Diluc, could you tell him about this?
Elzer: It just won't do, the way he just leaves the winery to its own devices all the time.

### Additional Talk 2

Elzer: Have you cleared the merchant roads out?
Traveler: They're spick and span.
Elzer: That's great. Our winery's business can gradually resume now.
Elzer: Honestly, I should have reported this matter to Master Diluc...
Elzer: But he's upped and disappeared. I've searched high and low for him all over the winery, but no one knows where he's gone.
Elzer: Adelinde said something like "Master Diluc has gone to attend to a personal matter," but refused to say anything more. She didn't even look worried.
Elzer: *sigh* Forget it. Once he's back, I will have a good talk with him...
