Traveler: Who is Ms. Kageyama?
Ebina Gonshirou: You don't even know who Ms. Kageyama is? I don't think you should be in Ritou!
Ebina Gonshirou: Miss Kageyama is an inspector at the Outlander Affairs Agency who is in charge of keeping an eye out for outlanders like you.
Ebina Gonshirou: There sure are lot more outlanders now the Sakoku Decree has been abolished... Looks like Ms. Kageyama's job is about to get a whole lot busier...
Ebina Gonshirou: If only I could help her out...
Ebina Gonshirou: *cough* Ahem. Whatever the case, if you wish to have a decent time in Ritou, you'd better get those documents and gifts prepared before visiting the inspector!
