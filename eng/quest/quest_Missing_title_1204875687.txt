# Missing title (1204875687)

Wizard Moneybags: Undisciplined, inelegant, unoriginal, uninspired... and completely uncoordinated.
Arataki Itto: Hey, what'cha complaining about? Oh, lemme guess, all your teammates we defeated?
Wizard Moneybags: ...
Wizard Moneybags: I'm talking about your fighting style.
Arataki Itto: Huh? Have you been hit in the head by a Specter, or something? This ain't some circus show, pal! You wanna know what my style is? Uncheckable strength, unwreckable will, and undefeatable beetles, that's what! I can give you a demonstration â€” if you dare.
Wizard Moneybags: Ugh, you bring back some bad memories... I do not deal well with loud and obnoxious types like you.
Wizard Moneybags: #Ah, but this blond fellow looks like easy pickings... Alright, I'll challenge him!
Arataki Itto: Pfft! Hahahahahahaha!
Arataki Itto: Hahahaha! Hey, compadre, did you hear what this joker just said? He thinks you're an easy win! So uh, how about you show him a little Arataki Gang hospitality?
Traveler: Haha, gladly!
Paimon: Paimon doesn't get it... These people haven't researched their opponents at all! All they're doing by coming one at a time is contributing to our winning streak.
Paimon: Grandmaster Hanakado's team members are a real mixed bag! They're no match for us three when it comes to strategy!
Traveler: Oh nooo~! Please don't bully me...
