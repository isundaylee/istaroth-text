# Akademiya Q&A


## Talk 1

Ziryab: I wonder if these questions are too difficult...
Ziryab: Hey! Traveler! Hold on a second.
Traveler: Who, me?
Ziryab: Yep! Hehe, I would like to ask you a small favor.
Traveler: You lost something?
Ziryab: What? ...Why did you sound so familiar with this? Ahaha!
Ziryab: But no, no. I didn't lose anything, nor did I lack research materials. As for inspiration... Well, I've found enough of it on my own.
Ziryab: Ahem, actually, I'm compiling a "Q&A" brochure to help the freshmen quickly grasp the various terms circulating in Sumeru.
Ziryab: In a nutshell, it's to explain complicated nouns in the form of questions and answers.
Ziryab: This way, it'll be more efficient and interesting for students to learn.
Ziryab: However, I'm not sure about the difficulty of these questions... so I thought I could use your help with it.
Traveler: I don't know much about the Akademiya...
Ziryab: Haha, it's okay. You'll at least know something about it after you answer my questions.
Ziryab: Don't worry. They are not daunting questions, just some... ordinary little ones.
Ziryab: Let's get started then. Here's the question.
Traveler: I think I've done something like this before...
Paimon: You mean the time when Swan in Mondstadt asked you those questions?
Paimon: But he gave us the answers in advance! Paimon doesn't think this person would do that for us...
Traveler: You ran out of materials?
Traveler: You are looking for inspiration?

## Talk 2

Ziryab: Ahem... As you may know, each Darshan in the Akademiya has its own specialized focus on research.
Ziryab: So, what's the name of the Darshan with the largest number of researchers? I'll give you a hint â€” it's the school with Biology as its major focus.
Traveler: Amurta.
Ziryab: Exactly!
Traveler: Armuta.
Ziryab: Well, quite the opposite of the correct answer.
Traveler: Atamur.
Ziryab: Haha, unfortunately, that's not the answer.

## Talk 3

Ziryab: Maybe you have come across some traveling researchers who call themselves Driyosh Traveling Scholars.
Ziryab: Actually, there are a great number of Driyosh in one of the Darshans of the Akademiya.
Ziryab: With the elements as the core of its theory, this Darshan studies a full range of things closely tied with elemental powers.
Ziryab: My question is: what's the name of this Darshan?
Traveler: Spantamad.
Ziryab: That's right. Spantamad, home to Elementalism researchers who see the Seven Great Elements as the essence of all matter and life.
Traveler: Haravatat.
Ziryab: Haha, wrong answer. Haravatat researchers study language, semiotics and logic... Trust me, it's really complicated.
Traveler: Rtawahist.
Ziryab: Well, unfortunately, You got it wrong. Rtawahist is the base camp of Illuminationism researchers whose research focus lies in the universe above us... Hehe, doesn't that sound appealing?

## Talk 4

Ziryab: If you look up, can you see the tree holding up the Akademiya?
Ziryab: My next question is a simple one that many would easily ignore.
Ziryab: Now listen, what's the name of the tree holding up the Akademiya?
Traveler: Great Tree.
Ziryab: Haha, pretty concise. But unfortunately, it's wrong.
Traveler: Divine Tree.
Ziryab: Haha, good, good! It's correct!
Traveler: Enormous Tree!
Ziryab: Well, as powerful as it sounds, it's wrong.

## Talk 5

Ziryab: Have you been outside the Sumeru City? There are some barriers around the desert.
Ziryab: My question is: what's the name of those barriers?
Traveler: Wall of Milh.
Ziryab: Actually, it's "Wall of Samiel." Don't forget that.
Traveler: Wall of Simoom.
Ziryab: Actually, it's "Wall of Samiel." It's used to proof sand, not wind. Hope you can recall it next time.
Traveler: Wall of Samiel.
Ziryab: Good, good. You got it right!

## Talk 6

Ziryab: Sumeru merchants often use a kind of beast to carry their goods when traveling long distances.
Ziryab: My question is: what's the name of the beast?
Traveler: Sumpter Beast.
Ziryab: Sumpter Beast it is. What a memory!
Traveler: Slumber Beast.
Ziryab: Actually, it's "Sumpter Beast." Hope you can recall it next time.
Traveler: Summer Beast.
Ziryab: Actually, the name of the beast is "Sumpter Beast." Hope you can recall it next time.

## Talk 7

Ziryab: There is... well... to put it simply, a mushroom-like monster in the wilderness of Sumeru.
Ziryab: My question is: what's the name of the monster?
Traveler: Fungi.
Ziryab: Fungi it is. They resemble mushrooms, after all.
Traveler: Fungee.
Ziryab: Actually, it's "Fungi." Think of mushrooms when you're recalling the word.
Traveler: Finger.
Ziryab: That's not even close... The answer should be "Fungi." Think of mushrooms when you're recalling the word.

## Talk 8

Ziryab: Okay. That's all for my questions today. Let's see how many questions you answered correctly...
Ziryab: Well done! You've got all three questions right. Looks like you've done your homework in Sumeru!
Ziryab: Please take these as a reward for all the work you've done.

## Talk 9

Ziryab: Hmm... you didn't answer them all correctly.
Ziryab: Hehe, it's alright. It's quite normal for a new visitor in Sumeru to answer some of the questions wrong.
Ziryab: Please take these as a thank-you for answering my questions.
