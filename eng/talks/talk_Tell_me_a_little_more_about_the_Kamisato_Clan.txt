Traveler: Tell me a little more about the Kamisato Clan.
Toda: Within the Kamisato Clan, the Commissioner Kamisato Ayato is in charge of all the Yashiro Commission's affairs. Miss Ayaka is in charge of everything in the mansion.
Toda: Inazuma's Tri-Commission have some really complicated relationships with each other. Although the Yashiro Commission is the least controversial among them, it is still very busy.
Toda: As such, Sir Kamisato doesn't really stay in the mansion too often. If you need something from the Kamisato Clan, it's better that you visit Miss Kamisato or Mr. Thoma.
