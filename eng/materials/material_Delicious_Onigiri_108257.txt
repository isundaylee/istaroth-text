# Delicious Onigiri

A portable dish made with rice. The crispy seaweed adds a bit of umami to the down-to-earth sweetness of the glutinous rice. For the final touch, the fresh fish within the Onigiri strikes like an ambushing band, and the satisfaction it brings to body and mind is like the clarion flourish of victory.
