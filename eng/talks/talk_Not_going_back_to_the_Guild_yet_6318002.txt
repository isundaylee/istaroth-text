Traveler: Not going back to the Guild yet?
Etsuko: Oh, hey, it's you.
Etsuko: Taisuke's been really taken with that talking cat named Neko. He insists that we continue investigating for a while.
Etsuko: I'm just here to make sure that he doesn't do anything idiotic in the process.
Etsuko: And I'm also taking this opportunity to slack off for a bit.
