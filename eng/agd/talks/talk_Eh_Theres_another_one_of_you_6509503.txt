Traveler: Eh? There's another one of you...
Argalia: Ah, you must've met my elder sister downstairs, huh?
Argalia: We're twins, and most people can't tell us apart by appearance. We sound very different, though, so we get exposed the moment we open our mouths.
Argalia: My sister speaks slow, but she's a careful sort. If you need help on the first floor of the restaurant, just leave it to her.
