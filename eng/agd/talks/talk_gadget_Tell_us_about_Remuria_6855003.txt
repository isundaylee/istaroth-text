Traveler: Tell us about Remuria...
Monsieur Os: Very well. The story begins before the Court of Fontaine as you know it was born...
Monsieur Os: The Sebastos, Remus, founded a nation above the High Sea that is Fontaine, and the ancestors of the present-day Fontainians named him the "Dark Lord Remus" in their terror.
Monsieur Os: Before it sank, this body of water was part of the Great Fontaine Lake and the location where the capital of Remuria was sited. As such, these waters have the same properties as those of Fontaine.
Monsieur Os: Unlike what you hear from most histories, the people of Remuria were not ordinary humans like the Fontainians. Rather, they were a new race, their bodies having been cast from stone, with Ichor for blood.
Monsieur Os: The Sebastos gave us such bodies in the hope that we could escape our prisons of rotting flesh and fate.
Monsieur Os: His great vision was that we should all grasp the power of the Symphony and thereby escape the shackles of Fortuna, becoming the masters of our own destiny.
Monsieur Os: We once possessed all of the High Sea, countless cities and palaces, flowers, flowing wine... and yet, fate found us all the same.
Monsieur Os: After returning from the deepest depths of the sea, the Sebastos used Ichor to create imperishable bodies for the people, and still, the prophesied future did not change.
Monsieur Os: Our God King believed that it was because human souls could not escape the gravity of fate, and so he wrote the "Symphony," a music that could weave destiny.
Monsieur Os: He believed that through this he had found a way to resist fate, but instead that path led us into utter darkness, step by step.
Monsieur Os: And in the end, the entire kingdom sank beneath the waves, as though it had been smote by divine judgment...
Monsieur Os: I fear that even he did not foresee such an outcome, though all the same, that is what happened.
