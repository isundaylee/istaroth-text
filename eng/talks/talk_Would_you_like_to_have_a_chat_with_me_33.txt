# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Bennett: Sure, lemme tell you all about my adventures!
Bennett: Hmm... A few days ago, I found an oddly colored Berry during an adventure!
Bennett: It was really sweet, but...
Traveler: Did you get the runs?
Bennett: Oh, diarrhea is nothing. I'm used to that.
Bennett: At first, there were a lot of colored lights, but then it felt like a lot of little people were dancing in my head.
Bennett: I recovered quickly enough, but I regret not putting some in my bag...
Bennett: I wanted to warn everyone to avoid eating that type of Berry.
Traveler: You're really considerate towards others, aren't you?
Bennett: Aw... this is how it ought to be.
Bennett: So many people took care of me, so I gotta return the favor!
Bennett: Oh, right! Remember to call me next time you go adventuring! With me around, you won't have to worry about those kinds of dangers at all!
Traveler: You need to be more careful yourself...
Bennett: Thanks, but there are times when it doesn't matter how careful I am. It would be better to warn others instead.
