Thoma: Great job here, you really know what you're doing! If you placed this in Inazuma, you could probably steal a good chunk of business from Hanamizaka.
Thoma: Shame I can't flex my "fixer" muscles around here. In other words... no discounts for Thoma.
Thoma: I won't let that affect our outings here though. Food and drink's on me, hehe.
