Traveler: About the Tatarigami...
Kaida Ryouma: I'm not very sure about what happened there either.
Kaida Ryouma: That said, considering the way the war went, it might well have been the work of Fatui special forces.
Kaida Ryouma: It's normal to use extraordinary methods to gain an advantage over one's foes in war. The Kujou art of war I learned once was famed for its swift and brutal assaults that care little for the cost.
Kaida Ryouma: But Her Excellency's playbook is quite different...
Kaida Ryouma: In any case, she was out at sea negotiating with some mercenaries. I don't think she would have been apprised of what happened here in time.
Kaida Ryouma: Thus, the only viable suspects in my eyes are the Fatui, who do really seem to enjoy poking their noses into other peoples' business...
Kaida Ryouma: Of course, this is just my opinion, I doubt that a simple samurai like myself could grasp the breadth of Her Excellency's thought.
