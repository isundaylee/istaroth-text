Ryouko: Welcome. Are you here in Ritou to take part in the Magnificent Irodori Festival?
Ryouko: The festival is very lively indeed, so please enjoy yourself, and don't forget to fill your stomach!
Ryouko: There are tons of queues and tons of things to queue up for, but if you don't eat, you might find yourself growing faint, especially under the hot sun.
Ryouko: During those times, feel free to come here to replenish your energy, hehe.

Ryouko: Welcome. Are you here in Ritou to take part in the Magnificent Irodori Festival?
Ryouko: We are still setting up, so there isn't a great deal of people right now. Once the event opens, Ritou should be absolutely buzzing with activity.

Ryouko: Hehe, welcome. Care to have some specialty snacks?

## Talk

Traveler: Sure, I'll have some.
Ryouko: Wonderful. Here is the menu.

Traveler: So, what's with this store?
Ryouko: This food stall... was founded by my husband, who asked me to join him.
Ryouko: I didn't really want to work in this line of business at first. You have to wake up early and go home late. My husband was never in good health either... How could he have handled this for long?
Ryouko: But he told me that he loved seeing the smile on people's faces while they were eating the snacks I made... In the end, I could not dissuade him.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Ryouko: Take care. I look forward to your next visit.

## Talk

Traveler: Your husband?
Ryouko: We promised each other that we'd buy a shop in Hanamizaka when we made enough money so that more people would be able to try our snacks.
Ryouko: ...But during the autumn two years ago, he didn't listen to me and insisted in purchasing goods in pouring rain. In the end...
Ryouko: Now, the best way for me to remember him is to run this stall well and cherish our memories together.
Ryouko: If you would visit more often, dear customer, that would certainly help him rest in peace...

Ryouko: I had no idea you were so good at cards. You must be exhausted from all that strategizing. Do you want to buy something to eat?

## Talk

Ryouko: Ha ha, it seems that you need to reconsider your deck composition...

## Talk

Traveler: You must be very good at cooking?
Ryouko: Hehe, this client has a way with words. Even though I'm not famous, I'm confident in my abilities when it comes to the seasoning of Inazuma snacks.
Ryouko: Here, I've cooked a fresh batch. Would you like to try some they are still hot?
Ryouko: It seems like you're an outlander. If the food isn't to your tastes, I can specially adjust the seasoning just for you.
