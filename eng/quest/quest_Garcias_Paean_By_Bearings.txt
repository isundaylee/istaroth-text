# Garcia's Paean: By Bearings


## Talk 1

Garcia: This bearing is too large. It wouldn't fit...
Ahangar: Too small last time, and too big now! You're going to use up all my Iron Chunks!
Lutong: In fact, we are also about to use up all our Mora.
Traveler: What are you arguing about?
Ahangar: This man asked me to forge lots of iron tubes and gears, with different requirements for each and every one of them.
Ahangar: I'm already using up all my Iron Chunks to forge these... things for him!
Ahangar: But he doesn't think that's enough, he wants even more gears.
Garcia: Please allow me to explain my work again, I'm sure you will understand...
Traveler: What are you doing here?
Lutong: Just let Mr. Garcia explain all this to Mr. Ahangar.
Lutong: Traveler, I... Well, Mr. Garcia needs a favor. Will you collect some Iron Chunks for us?
Traveler: I do have the time, but...
Lutong: About that... We have encountered some challenges, which were expected. Mr. Garcia is still pondering a solution.
Lutong: If this should interest you at some point in the future, feel free to ask Mr. Garcia for more information.
Lutong: I fear that no one really understands the exact mechanisms behind the machine, save him.
Lutong: But before that, please bring some Iron Chunks back here.
Traveler: How are the modifications to his machine going?

## Talk 2

Lutong: Did you bring the Iron Chunks?

## Talk 3

Ahangar: Okay! Okay! I'll just forge the gears for you! Just... stop talking!
Garcia: But I haven't finished my explanation...
Ahangar: Now that we have the Iron Chunks, I'm going back to work. You, back off!
Black Screen Text: Ahangar swings his hammer so fiercely that Garcia has to back away from him...
Lutong: Let's leave Mr. Ahangar to his work. Here's your payment.
Traveler: I hope you will succeed this time.
Lutong: That means so much. Thank you, Traveler.
Lutong: I am... cautiously pessimistic about this.
Lutong: Mr. Garcia is a genius with machines. That much is beyond doubt.
Lutong: But if you ask me, the machine that Mr. Garcia envisions requires much more than just one "genius."

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Ahangar: What do you want all those gears and tubes for? Are you building an iron house or something?
Garcia: True enough, sir! A house it is, a house filled with gears â€” that is what I am building.
Garcia: I have named the area containing some of the gears the "Storage," while the bearings and the rest of the gears make up the "Numberbase."
Garcia: The gears in Storage are used for recording and storing numbers, and those in Numberbase for calculation.
Garcia: A sketch might help you understand. Do you happen to have some paper on you? No? Never mind, I'll draw on my clothes. That should make things clearer...
Garcia: Pass me the coal, will you? Many thanks, please look at this...
