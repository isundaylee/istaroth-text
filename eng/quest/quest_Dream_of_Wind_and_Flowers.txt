# Dream of Wind and Flowers


## Talk 1

Paimon: Hey, Jean!
Jean: Traveler! Ah â€” excuse me. I should address you as Honorary Knight under the circumstances.
Jean: I suppose you heard? You're this year's Windblume Star. You will be making an offering of Windblumes to the Anemo Archon, Barbatos, on behalf of the whole of Mondstadt.
Jean: ...Although... things will be a little different this time.
Paimon: *sigh* ...Yeah... But with us and the Tone-Deaf Bard here, this year's Windblume Festival is sure to be bigger than ever!
Jean: That is true... Thank you for taking up residence in Mondstadt, and I hope you continue to enjoy Mondstadt life.
Jean: Oh! The Windblume Ceremony is about to begin. Windblume Star, have you chosen your Windblume?
Paimon: So we choose one type of flower, then offer it to the Anemo Archon, right?
Jean: Exactly right. Please consider your choice carefully. Remember, you are representing the whole of Mondstadt.
Traveler: Venti, what kind of flower do you like?
Venti: Eh? ...Very cunning, trying to cheat, are we?
Jean: Ahem...
Paimon: Hey! Don't you two go spilling secrets during an occasion like this!
Venti: Haha, they told us!
Venti: Don't worry about me, choose something you like! I trust your tastes.
Jean: So, Honorary Knight, what is your choice?
Traveler: Dandelion
Paimon: Ahhhh... throwing your weight behind one of the people's favorites! Windblumes must be dandelions after all!
Jean: On behalf of the people of Mondstadt, please offer your Windblume to the statue.
Traveler: Windwheel Aster
Paimon: Ahhhh... Throwing your weight behind one of the people's favorites! Windblumes must be Windwheel Asters after all!
Traveler: Cecilia
Paimon: Oh! Same idea as Beatrice, Cecilias for Windblumes. Pretty niche, but not without advocates!
Traveler: Small Lamp Grass
Paimon: Oh! Same idea as Nimrod, Small Lamp Grass for Windblumes... A flower to light up the dark!
Traveler: Sweet Flower
Paimon: Oh! Same idea as Sucrose, Sweet Flowers for Windblumes. A flower that has lasted through the ages!
Traveler: Wolfhook
Paimon: Oh! Same idea as Razor, Wolfhooks for Windblumes. Spiky and tingly!

## Talk 2

Jean: Thank you, Windblume Star, for your sincere Windblume offering to the Anemo Archon, Barbatos. May the wind protect Mondstadt.
Venti: Huh, interesting choice.
Traveler: You like it?
Venti: Hehe, take a guess...
Paimon: Typical Tone-Deaf Bard, stop making people guess all the time!
Venti: Ahahahaha! Okay, okay, I'll tell you. But not here though.
Venti: Not a good idea with so many people in the plaza... Change of surroundings needed.
Paimon: Where should we go?
Venti: I want you to come with me to Stormterror's Lair.

## Talk 3

Venti: Ah... now this is a view.
Traveler: The scenery is beautiful.
Venti: Isn't it? I am fond of this place. Sometimes, when I've got nothing else to do, I come here just to sit and gaze awhile.
Paimon: You mean sit and laze around?
Venti: Hahaha, guilty as charged!
Venti: ...It's so beautiful... if only we had some cider in hand.
Venti: So, Traveler. The Mondstadt Windblume Festival. Do you like it?
Traveler: It's full of love and cheer.
Venti: And yet, you still have something you wish to ask, do you not?
Traveler: ...
Venti: I know your question. What are Windblumes, exactly? And what do Windblumes and the Windblume Festival mean to Barbatos, the Anemo Archon?
Venti: As you've seen, the people of Mondstadt each make their own choice. Out of the millions of flowers there are, some choose the dandelion, others choose the Windwheel Aster.
Paimon: Huh... it does seem like "Windblume" means something unique to each person.
Venti: Correct, and long may that be the case. There is no single answer and no true Windblumes in existence.
Paimon: So Windblumes... don't really exist?
Venti: The word "Windblume" dates from the age of Old Mondstadt. It was a code word that the people used to stay in contact and mount resistance in secret.
Venti: At that time, the people often said that the stronger the wind blows, the firmer the roots of the Windblume grow, and the brighter the flowers that burst into bloom.
Venti: If you want my perspective, Windblumes don't exist. Yet they are all around us nonetheless.
Venti: They are the spirit of yearning for freedom, the courage to follow the wind wherever it may lead... All objects that are beautiful and worthy of blessing... All can be Windblumes.
Paimon: You can't see them, but you can feel their presence everywhere... just like the wind!
Venti: Haha, well said.
Venti: So what are Windblumes? Something that the Anemo Archon Barbatos will not define.
Venti: Flowers of blessings, flowers of respect, flowers of love. Every individual has their own Windblumes, and every individual has the right to define them.
Paimon: Guess it's no surprise that the type of flower given by the City of Freedom to its deity is in itself an expression of freedom.
Traveler: I enjoy the feeling of freedom, too.
Venti: I know.
Venti: It is people's shared will that brings them onto the same page. And surely, it is the wind of freedom that brought us together.
Venti: It comes from the end of the journey, the edge of the world, the depths of our hearts. It is ceaseless.
Venti: "Who was it that stroked your bloodied, determined visage\nBy stream flowing small\nBy boulder standing large"
Venti: "Who was it that embraced your weary yet noble soul\nIn dreams deep\nIn skies soaring"
Venti: "Dear friend\nI am leading you by the hand\nInto the night where lanterns shine bright"
Venti: "To tell you a tale of freedom and dreams\nThe tale of where this festival begins"
Traveler: It's great to be with everyone.
Traveler: It's a pleasant atmosphere.
