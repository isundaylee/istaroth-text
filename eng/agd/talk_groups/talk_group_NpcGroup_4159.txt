Traveler: And you are...
Jahangir: I am the owner of this food store, and as the name implies, I feed empty stomachs.
Jahangir: Order cooked food or use my pot to cook on your own, it's your choice! Eating is all about having a good time with others, wouldn't you say?
Jahangir: It's especially true for the traveling merchants and sailors who come and go. They are too busy to have decent meals every day. But here at my store, they can at least have a warm bite.
Jahangir: Thanks to them, I get the chance to have a taste of delicacies from all around the world! Haha.

Traveler: See you.
