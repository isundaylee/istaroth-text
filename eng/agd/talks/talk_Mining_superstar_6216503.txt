Traveler: Mining superstar?
Tu: That's right! It's a nickname everyone gave me. A sign of affection, I'm sure. I mean, I did dig up ten tons of ore in one day that one time!
Tu: From then on, everyone started calling me the mining superstar.
Tu: It's just a shame that The Chasm's been sealed up. If not, the others would all be around for you to ask. Trust me, they'll all know who I am.
