# Jade Chamber Rising


## Talk 1

Paimon: #Did you hear that, Traveler? They said they had some useful information!
Paimon: Information's just what we need right now. Let's follow them and see what we can find out!

## Talk 2

Changfeng: The rebuilding of the Jade Chamber is a monumental task, and we are the ones who have been entrusted with this work. It is only right that we put our hearts and souls into this project.

## Talk 3

Paimon: Huh... They're not here. Let's keep looking.

## Talk 4

Paimon: #Psst! Traveler! Do you think Shenhe might be an adeptus?
Paimon: It seems like it's her first time in Liyue Harbor, and she doesn't seem to get how things work here... If she's an adeptus, that would explain everything.
Paimon: Where does she fit in with the other adepti, though? Paimon's super curious...

## Talk 5

Leming: First, we construct the keel of the Jade Chamber. The keel is the part that holds the Plaustrite, so once that arrives, it goes straight in...

## Talk 6

Anshun: Normally, it would be Lady Keqing supervising the construction work. But it seems like she's been a little preoccupied lately...

## Talk 7

Baizhu: Why does Lady Ningguang need so much wound dressing?
Baizhu: Is it really such risky business, rebuilding the Jade Chamber? This is all most peculiar...

### Additional Talk 1

Lizheng: Shh... Quiet! Can't you see that I'm concentrating here? Every brick is a crucial component! If I stop concentrating, I'm gonna lay a brick out of whack, and that'll put the whole darn structure out of whack, and then... Well, shoot, and then it's all over...

### Additional Talk 2

Siqin: I'm under orders to ensure the security of this location. It's imperative that construction stays on schedule. Hopefully, there won't be any setbacks.

### Additional Talk 3

Liang: We've been pretty active in the Millelith recently. I don't know what's going on but... I'd better be careful.

### Additional Talk 4

Baiwen: This is a matter of utmost importance. I must not let Lady Ningguang down...
Baiwen: Oh? Are you here to deliver construction materials?
