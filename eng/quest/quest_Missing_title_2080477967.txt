# Missing title (2080477967)

Traveler: Who's that person?
Herman: Huh, have you... never heard of the adventurer Herman before?
Herman: ...No, this must be your way provoking me to make a comeback. I've already seen through you!
Herman: It's a shame. As I am now, all I can do is provide younger adventurers like you with snippets of my experience. I don't go out on adventures anymore.
