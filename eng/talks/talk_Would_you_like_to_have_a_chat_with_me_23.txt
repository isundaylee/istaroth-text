# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Albedo: Certainly.
Albedo: Uh... I will let you decide the topic of our conversation.
Traveler: You really like to draw...
Albedo: Yes, this is a habit that I formed a long time ago.
Albedo: Initially, it was for research purposes. I originally tried to reproduce subjects with a rubbing technique.
Albedo: However, the results were inadequate and lacked spirit.
Albedo: After that, I tried to learn how to draw.
Albedo: While refining my artistic skills, I unconsciously found myself engrossed in drawing.
Albedo: Hmm, anything else...?
Albedo: Probably you.
Albedo: At first, it was because you carry the aura of the stars.
Albedo: But now... it seems that there is more to it.
Albedo: Why is this? Give me some time and I can conduct experiments to find out.
Traveler: You really like to conduct experiments...
Albedo: Hmm, if you ask me, the world is a limitless library.
Albedo: There's a multitude of research topics for experiments...
Albedo: You can use your own hands to unearth unknown secrets and ultimately master new knowledge.
Albedo: This sort of feeling is captivating.
Traveler: Is there anything else you're interested in?
