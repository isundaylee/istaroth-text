Traveler: Who are you?
Mikoshi Genjirou: I'm Mikoshi Genjirou, a government official affiliated with the Tenryou Commission.
Mikoshi Genjirou: What... So you are not here to take over my shift? Then please leave me alone.
Mikoshi Genjirou: An elite like me is always either hard at work or honing my skills. This is a world in which only the best survive, after all. Only the most excellent will stick around.

Traveler: What are your thoughts about your work?
Mikoshi Genjirou: I believe that everyone should take their own job seriously. This is the only way to keep the whole system functioning properly.
Mikoshi Genjirou: Like those people from the army. They still haven't been able to defeat Sangonomiya after such a long time. A laughable lot!
Mikoshi Genjirou: From what I heard, the Sangonomiya troops have appointed some "dog" as their commander... If that's true, then that Kujou Sara really is good for nothing!

Traveler: Is Mikoshi Genichirou your elder brother?
Mikoshi Genjirou: Tsk... That incompetent loser. He's content with just owning a small shop. He is still the same after all these years. So sluggish.
Mikoshi Genjirou: I knew that he wouldn't accomplish anything ever since he was little. And as expected, the future of the Mikoshi clan is still mine to uphold.
