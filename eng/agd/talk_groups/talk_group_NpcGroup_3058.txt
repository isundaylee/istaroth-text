Traveler: You wanted some White Iron Chunks?
Yata Kouki: You can't sharpen your blade if it goes blunt in battle. So, best to have Mr. Amenoma make me a shiny new one well in advance.
Yata Kouki: Have you taken on my commission? If so, I guess you've got those 5 White Iron Chunks.
Traveler: Got 'em.
Traveler: Not yet.
Yata Kouki: Alright, well just bring them here once you've got them.

Traveler: I'm just passing through.
Yata Kouki: Really?
Yata Kouki: Hmm... You weren't doing anything suspicious earlier, that's for sure. You may pass.
Yata Kouki: The exit's that way, so don't wander around. The headquarters of the Tenryou Commission can be a confusing place, and you don't want to get "lost."
