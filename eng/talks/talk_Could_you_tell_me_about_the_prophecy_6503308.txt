Traveler: Could you tell me about the "prophecy"?
Estelle: Ah, the flood. That magic pocket your magician friend provided proved very useful.
Estelle: I wasn't a believer in the prophecy myself. But I put a lot of spare parts and tools inside, just in case.
Estelle: And boy, am I glad I did. I'd never have found them all if the water had swept them away.
Estelle: So it looks like you and your friends weren't affected too badly? Great, it's such a relief the prophecy crisis has finally passed.
