Khaldun: Studying ancient history through linguistics and semiotics is tunnel-visioning. It's impossible to draw any meaningful conclusions from it.
Khaldun: This is where you Haravatat would make mistakes. See Faruzan.

Yavanani: Your sociological approach to history would be putting the cart before the horse.
Yavanani: It is meaningless to try to find some universal rules and norms that can explain all events throughout history.
Yavanani: As for Faruzan, her points are out of date. Can't even be used as a reference.
Khaldun: Hmph. I beg to differ.

Yavanani: I reckon that the most important quality required to manage the House of Daena is to be able to discern the academic value of books and adhere to the virtues of the Akademiya.
Yavanani: So Rifaet of Hara{RUBY#[S]Semiotics}vatat is the better choice.

Yavanani: Again? Were the arguments during the day not enough...?
