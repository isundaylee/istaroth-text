Traveler: How do you like it here?
Kujou Sara: Though it is not as extensive as the Kujou Clan's estate, I find it comfortable enough.
Kujou Sara: So everything here was built according to your designs? I did not know you possessed such abilities.
Kujou Sara: If we ever need to expand the Kujou Clan residence, I'll be sure to find you.
Traveler: Uh, no need...
Kujou Sara: What's the matter? Are you unwilling to assist?
Kujou Sara: Heh, either way, I'm not here to twist your arm. You needn't worry.
Kujou Sara: In fact, there is little that can be changed about the Kujou Clan residence. I mean, it would never become a place like this, at least.
Kujou Sara: I've never visited a place filled with such vitality and happiness...
Traveler: I'm up to the challenge!
Kujou Sara: I have not yet mentioned any specifics and you already agree so readily?
