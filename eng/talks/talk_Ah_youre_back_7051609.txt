# Talk Dialog

Adelinde: Ah, you're back.
Adelinde: How are things at Falcon Coast?
Paimon: Hmm, it's kinda hard to explain.
Traveler: It's too early to say for sure.
Adelinde: Fair enough. Well, I don't know the first thing about combat situations anyway, so you can spare yourselves the ordeal of trying to explain it all to me.
Adelinde: If there's anything you need, let me know, and I'll sort it out.
Adelinde: I'll be right here when you need me.
Traveler: We need to keep monitoring the situation for a while.
