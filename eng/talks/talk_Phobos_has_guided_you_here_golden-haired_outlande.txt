# Talk Dialog

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Phobos has guided you here, golden-haired outlander.
Traveler: And you are...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Lucius Patricius am I, a musician of our empire.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Be not alarmed, outlander. Unlike my kin who have been inundated by their dreams, I still maintain the tranquility of my melody.
Traveler: What is this place?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): This was, once upon a time, Portus Anticus. The most prosperous port in the empire. Today, it is our sepulcher.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): If you seek the bronze bell that once dispersed the boundless ocean fog, then continue upward. Mayhap time and rust have not utterly devoured her.
Traveler: You seem pretty calm about all this...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): The fall of the empire, the death of our God King... All these things were predestined. Getting emotional about events long-fated is unwise.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Why should one agonize over a matter that is merely a part of life? In truth, every moment in life is worthy of our tears.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Moreover, of what benefit is sorrow and resentment, if punishment cannot wipe away sin?
Traveler: See you.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_GADGET): Farewell, golden-haired outlander. May your music be tranquil.
