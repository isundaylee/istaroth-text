Traveler: Anything of note nearby?
Ngahue: If you head west along this main road by the edge, you'll end up at the Stadium of the Sacred Flame.
Ngahue: People go there to either watch or take part in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, as well as do a bit of business on the side. You have something I want, I have something you want, type of thing.
Ngahue: If you came over from the east, you've probably already run into the Children of Echoes. Did you buy any gemstones while you were there?
Ngahue: If you go south from here, you'll reach the edge of a great cliff where you can test your bravery against that lot from the Scions of the Canopy.
Ngahue: Each of their hobbies seems to be more dangerous than the last...
Ngahue: And then if you keep heading to the place where there's water, you'll reach my home, the People of the Springs.
Ngahue: If you're tired from the journey, you can gaze out to sea, or take a bath in the hot springs.

Traveler: Any recommendations?
Ngahue: And as they say, things don't always pan out as you expected. If you don't have a clear destination, you might as well go with the flow — or leave your fate in someone else's hands.
Ngahue: Are there many other wayfinders like me over at my tribe, you ask?
Ngahue: We're not picky about our destination. When we can't decide where to go next, we'll pick up a stick, head over to a Statue of the Pyro Archon, then spin it around on the ground — and whichever way it points is where we go.
Ngahue: Praise be to Lady Haborym! Whenever I follow her guidance, I always learn something new.

Traveler: Let's leave the path ahead to fate...
Ngahue: Indeed! Well said! Now that sounds like something the Masters of the Night-Wind might say!
Ngahue: Still, doesn't the saying itself effectively just mean "let's go with the flow"?
Ngahue: Well, not that living that way would be bad. Sometimes things come to you even when you don't take the initiative!
