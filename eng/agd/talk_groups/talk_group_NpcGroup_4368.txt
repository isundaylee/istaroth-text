Hawad: But I heard that she's gone to Sumeru City to look for her lover.
Hawad: What a pity... I don't even know her name...

Traveler: What are your best sellers?
Hawad: Ajilenakh Nuts have been the most in demand lately.
Hawad: Ajilenakh Nuts are a common crop that the people of the desert used to plant. They make pretty good desserts and candy because of their high sugar content.
Hawad: Sweets make people happy, so I guess that's where its popularity comes from.
Hawad: I heard researchers from the Akademiya are even trying to find out which type of light produces sweeter Ajilenakh Nuts. I really look forward to their results.
