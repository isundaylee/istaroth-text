Quest Test NPC: In front of you is the danger zone... Huh? Could you possibly be...
Traveler: ...What's wrong?
Quest Test NPC: Your attire... Could you be the traveler they spoke of?
Quest Test NPC: Huh? You don't? Your heroic deeds have already spread across Mondstadt. I heard that it was you who put an end to the storms that terrorized Mondstadt!
Quest Test NPC: Though I believe you're capable of dealing with the monsters ahead, I'd still like to ask you to watch out and take care.
Traveler: Goodbye.
Quest Test NPC: Take care.
