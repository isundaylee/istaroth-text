Traveler: Did you just say "Barbara-sama"?
Albert: Yes. Is there something you find strange about that?
Albert: Barbara-sama lights up my world. She is so adorable, so kind, so pure and innocent...
Albert: ...What's that look for? You think I'm making this up?
Albert: #You, {M#sir}{F#ma'am}, need to be baptized in the spirit!
Albert: ...By which I mean, you need to witness one of Barbara-sama's live performances!
Albert: Do you hear me? You must go and watch her performance! *sigh* You ignorant fool... You wouldn't recognize the grace of the gods if it slapped you in the face!
