# Let the Wind Lead


## Talk 1

Venti: Oh? What are you doing here?
Venti: Though I was just wondering if you would happen to follow me...
Traveler: I want to know more about the Anemo God.
Venti: You speak of the God of Anemo, Barbatos? He already disappeared from Mondstadt a long time ago.
Venti: Liyue and Inazuma's respective gods of Geo and Electro are still present, but Mondstadt has seen many a moon since they last saw their own god.
Venti: Why do you wish to know about the God of Anemo? Does it have something to do with Dvalin?
Paimon: Oh... ahhh... it's because gods...
Traveler: Yes, someone told me about Dvalin's past.
Venti: Just how is it that everyone sees Stormterror? I'm quite curious.
Venti: That said, there's no need to rush...
Venti: I have not been back in a while, it seems there are a few who are unhappy with my arrival.

## Talk 2

Venti: Seems the dragon wasn't the only thing affected by this change in the wind...
Venti: Now then, you were saying someone had told you about the dragon?
Venti: Is that so? Quite the scholar I must say, that Lisa.
Venti: She's not wrong. The conflict has reached this point, only because both sides have resorted to the use of force.
Venti: His hate, however, did not arise from the people not making tribute to The Four Winds.
Venti: Nor was it born from his own nature, but instead came about as a product of his degradation.
Paimon: Degra... dation?
Venti: The black blood flowing through his heart has been torturing him for years.
Traveler: Abyss Mage? Never heard such a name.
Traveler: I think I've heard of them before in Mondstadt...
Venti: That's what has allowed him to be led astray by the lies of the Abyss Mage.
Venti: They are from the Abyss Order, an organization comprised of non-human beings. They despise mankind.
Venti: Correct. They are from the Abyss Order, an organization comprised of non-human beings. They despise mankind.
Venti: I don't know where they come from. All I know is that they hold deep hatred towards the human world.
Venti: Many hilichurls out in the wild take orders from them and act as their weapons.
Venti: Before arriving here, I too was like Dvalin, cursed and left to waste.
Venti: But now, before us stands the Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero, the place from which Mondstadt rose.
Venti: The wind amongst the branches is good, I love the way it smells...
Venti: Being here with you beneath this great tree feels like when the tear was purified earlier. Like the poison is leaving my body...
Venti: Mmmmmmm... Feels much better.
Paimon: So... how exactly did you get poisoned?
Venti: Ahh... that would be because I tried to communicate with Dvalin earlier, but was... interrupted...
Traveler: Oh, ah... that...
Traveler: That was ...me?
Venti: As a result, not only did I not manage to help Dvalin break his curse, but instead, was also infected myself!
Venti: Yes, it was you!
Venti: #So, to make up for it, {NICKNAME}, you're coming with me to the Cathedral!
Paimon: The Mondstadt Cathedral? To do what exactly?
Venti: To claim a certain "Holy Lyre der Himmel."
