## Talk 1

Mazkal: Come on, Kururuk, be good now. You haven't recovered fully yet, so don't sneak out to hunt again. You wouldn't want me to worry, would you?
Mazkal: Besides, your hunts have netted us a whole mountain of raw meat — waaaay too much for you to finish. It's going to go to waste at this rate.
"Kururuk": Wraah! Wraah!
Mazkal: That's right, that's a good boy, Kururuk. You're just the best, most obedient Qucusaurus, aren't you? H—Hey, stop that, you! That tickles!
"Kururuk": Wrraaaaah~

Paimon: #Oh no, here comes trouble! C'mon, Traveler, we've gotta go help her — again!
