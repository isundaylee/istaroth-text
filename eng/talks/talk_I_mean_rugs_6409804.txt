Traveler: I mean rugs...
Aftab: Oh, you mean these rugs!
Aftab: Good question. I've been asking myself why I needed all these rugs.
Aftab: But Sulaykha would talk my ear off every time I went to the Grand Bazaar, and I'd come back with several rugs in tow...
Aftab: She made a lot of sense on how each rug was useful...
Aftab: But it's a different story when I get home.
Aftab: I don't know why I just couldn't stop buying them!
