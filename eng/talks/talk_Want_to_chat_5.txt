Traveler: Want to chat?
Dori: I most certainly would!
Dori: The question is, have you brought enough Mora?
Traveler: Uh, why are you so obsessed with Mora?
Dori: Well, first and foremost, I'm a merchant.
Dori: Second, Mora is shiny, round, and mesmerizing!
Dori: And third, only if you truly adore Mora will it always come running your way.
Dori: So, work hard and cherish every Mora you make.
Dori: That way, I can stay by your side and keep earning Mora from you forever.
Dori: Well, whaddya waiting for? Get out there and chase that Mora!
Traveler: Why do you want to make so much Mora?
Dori: Because Mora is the loveliest thing in the whole world!
Dori: And I don't want to lose anything precious to me again due to a lack of Mora... Never again...
Dori: Ahem, anyway, Mora can solve most of life's problems.
Dori: And if you ever find a problem that Mora can't fix, just try doubling the amount you're offering!
