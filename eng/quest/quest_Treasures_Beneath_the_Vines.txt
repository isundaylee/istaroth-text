# Treasures Beneath the Vines


## Talk 1

Ulman: I'm counting on you then, Traveler. I'm sure we're a good team.
Traveler: About treasure-seeking...
Ulman: So, have you found any "Ancient Iron Coins"?
Traveler: See you.
Ulman: I'm counting on you then, Traveler. Come back and bring me the "Ancient Iron Coins" if you find any.

## Talk 2

Ulman: Didn't you bring me here, little one? Keep moving!
Ulman: Never mind, you better stay put...
Traveler: What are you up to?
Ulman: I'm duped by it, again... Let me give you a rundown from the beginning.
Ulman: For starters, you may not believe Seelie are somehow easily drawn to me.
Ulman: Among the Seelie that came to follow me, I found one kind that is particularly keen on treasure-seeking.
Ulman: I'm not good at naming. I'll just call them Treasure-Seeking Seelie.
Ulman: They excel at treasure-seeking. With their help, I dug up a lot of treasures and made a profit with them.
Ulman: But sometimes they suddenly tune out on me. I don't know if they're tired of the seeking, or just think I'm too boring...
Ulman: Then I'd find a helper favored by the Seelie.
Ulman: The helper takes Treasure-Seeking Seelie to locate the treasures, and I sell them for a fair price.
Ulman: They say ruins and antiques are everywhere in Sumeru. So I came to look for my fortune.
Ulman: And I attracted a bunch of Seelie here, of course. Some Treasure-Seeking Seelie brought me here.
Ulman: But they ignored me again not long after I scooped up some dirt...
Ulman: Eh? Why did it suddenly start to move? Could it be...
Ulman: Traveler, are you interested in treasure-seeking with Seelie?
Traveler: Me?
Ulman: That won't be necessary. Just follow it and dig where it stops.
Ulman: How's that sound? Just give it a try... If you scoop up some treasure, I'll only want the "Ancient Iron Coins" if there is any. The rest is all yours!
Ulman: And say you do help me find some of those coins, I'll pay you for them at a fair price.
Traveler: I could give it a go...
Ulman: That's the spirit! I like you!
Ulman: Anyways, we are partners now!
Ulman: Take this notebook. I recorded on it some hidden treasure sites I found before but haven't had a chance for a dig.
Ulman: I'm counting on you then, Traveler. Come back and bring me the "Ancient Iron Coins" if you find any.
Traveler: What are "Ancient Iron Coins"?
Ulman: Simply put, it's a kind of antique.
Ulman: With good connections, I'll be able to exchange the coins for some decent stuff.
Ulman: I haven't found any good connections though...
Traveler: I don't know their language...
Traveler: Is this... a Seelie?
Ulman: You mean the little one? Ugh, sort of...

## Talk 3

Ulman: Didn't you bring me here, little one? Keep moving!
Ulman: Never mind, you better stay put...
Traveler: Ulman?
Ulman: Traveler? It's been a while.
Ulman: Are you still bumming around the world? I've heard many amazing stories about you. You're really phenomenal.
Ulman: What troubles are you gonna fix this time in Sumeru?
Traveler: Don't jinx me.
Ulman: Right, back to business, Traveler. How about another team-up action?
Ulman: The land of Sumeru is strewn with treasures. Mora everywhere.
Ulman: Seelie are drawn to me as usual. And the Treasure-Seeking Seelie we got so familiar with are among them too.
Ulman: Same as before. You and the Seelie look for treasures, and I'll prepare your payment.
Ulman: We'll surely rake it in as a team!
Traveler: "Iron Coins" again?
Ulman: No. This time I'm looking for "Ancient Iron Coins," which are worth more.
Traveler: It's just another coin!
Ulman: It's not! The antique ones sell for more Mora.
Ulman: So it's a deal then. Let's make a pile as a team like we used to!
Traveler: Can't you find someone else?
Ulman: Well, you always team up with the one you are familiar with.
Ulman: And we're friends! I look out for my friends.
Traveler: Last time we met, you didn't have that silver tongue.
Ulman: Hehe, that's what you must have to persuade your buyers.
Traveler: Not before I "fix" you first.
Ulman: Haha, better not. I wouldn't be strong enough to take your fixing punches.
Ulman: Seriously, Traveler. How about we team up again?
Traveler: What are you doing here?
