Su Er'niang: Who's the fool that disagrees?
Su Er'niang: Why, that manager of the warehouse, Gou San'er. Who else!?
Su Er'niang: After working all morning to prepare the food, I saw him looking after the warehouse all by himself. He looked quite tired, so I offered him some...
Su Er'niang: Once he was finished, I asked him if he liked it. He said that he would have preferred something saltier and spicier!
Su Er'niang: Some nerve he has talking like that! And to think that I was kind enough to offer him some!
Su Er'niang: You see? I get all worked up just thinking about it. I'll be sure teach him a thing or two about good cooking!
