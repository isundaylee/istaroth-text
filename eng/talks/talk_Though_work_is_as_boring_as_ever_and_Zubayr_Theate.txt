Farhad: Though work is as boring as ever and Zubayr Theater has no new showings, there seems to be no shortage of prospects as of late!
Farhad: Say, friend, are you going to watch the Interdarshan Championship? I hear Miss Nilou's going to be commentating!
Farhad: I wasn't much of a student growing up. Felt like I had an allergy to learning. However, after listening to how Miss Nilou breaks things down, the knowledge seems a lot easier for me to grasp.
Farhad: If you missed Miss Nilou's commentary, it's your loss.
