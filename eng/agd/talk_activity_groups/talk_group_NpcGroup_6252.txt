Toltec: This isn't good...

Traveler: Did something bad happen?
Toltec: "Something bad," you say... I could easily come up with a whole basket of that stuff.
Toltec: You know, we have plenty of tribespeople who help escort Iktomisaurs to read the trends of the Ley Lines and phlogiston — including me, and I'm one of the better-spoken ones.
Toltec: Honestly speaking, our ley Lines seem to be falling further and further below "healthy," and the Abyss is a threat that cannot be taken lightly...
Toltec: But I suppose life isn't all bad, eh? Always one or two things that can make you happy, and all that.
Toltec: When I feel down, I just hang out in our tribe's trophy room, focusing on the woven scrolls and paintings.
Toltec: Even if it's not for work, it's still a great pastime.

Traveler: Thinking about graffiti again, are we?
Toltec: Haha, I should have expected no less of the one chosen by Elder Tlapo! You saw straight through me at a glance.
Toltec: Graffiti is the kind of art style that... really requires natural talent.
Toltec: Talent I evidently don't have, or I'd have thrown up the perfect masterpiece to showcase the arc of both the Ley Lines and phlogiston.

Traveler: Sorry to bother you...
Toltec: No, it's okay.

## Talk

Traveler: You can do something like that?
Toltec: Of course. There are plenty of fields where graffiti can be used. Most people just don't consider them, is all.
Toltec: Woven scrolls, stone carvings, graffiti — these are all media used to keep records and express oneself. In the hands of someone talented, they can certainly play roles as positive as they are unexpected.

## Talk

Toltec: Very good... Very good...

Traveler: In a good mood, I see?
Toltec: Indeed! Everything's looking up. It's quite astounding, really.
Toltec: You know, we have plenty of tribespeople who help escort Iktomisaurs to read the trends of the Ley Lines and phlogiston — including me, and I'm one of the better-spoken ones.
Toltec: The Ley Lines here in Natlan have never been as healthy as this. To be frank, every day I wake up and wonder if I'm not still dreaming.
Toltec: We owe that hero from Snezhnaya... or should I say Khaenri'ah, a debt of gratitude, and of the utmost respect.
Toltec: Of course, it's not just the Abyss that affects the Ley Lines. We still have work that must be regularly undertaken.
