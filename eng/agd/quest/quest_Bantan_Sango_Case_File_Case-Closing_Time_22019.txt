# Bantan Sango Case File: Case-Closing Time


## Talk 1

Sango: ...Alright then, I'll be counting on you two.
Andou: You can rest assured, Ms. Sango.
Amano: I can't believe that he's been hiding under our noses for so long. He's got a lot of nerve.
Amano: What with... who he was pretending to be...
Sango: In any case, today shall be the end of his "career." Ryuuji, do you remember what I said?
Ryuuji: Mm-hmm.
Sango: Good... You're here too, Traveler. That's great.
Traveler: Are you going to catch the thief?
Sango: I've collected enough evidence and I've figured out the culprit's habits.
Sango: Traveler, will you go with Ryuuji, Andou, and Amano to bring the culprit to justice?
Sango: He must have several accomplices. With you there, the success of the operation will be more certain.
Traveler: What do I do?
Sango: Just use your unsurpassed aura to shock the culprit so that he won't do anything... particularly stupid.
Sango: But again, I think a thief who can only sneak around won't have the nerve to make any drastic moves.
Sango: If I'm right, our guy will have gone into the wilds to bury the newly stolen goods.
Sango: If you go there now, you should be able to catch him red-handed. I'll wait here for your good news.
Traveler: Aren't you coming along?
Sango: My part is done, so I'll stay out of it.
Sango: Traveler, use your unsurpassed aura to shock the culprit so that he won't do anything... particularly stupid.
Sango: But again, I think a thief who can only sneak around won't have the nerve to make any drastic moves.
Traveler: Are you going to close the case?
Sango: Yes. If everything goes well, it will be closed today.

## Talk 2

Ryuuji: Found him. He's burying the loot...
Traveler: Let's get him!
Ryuuji: Wait, Traveler. Now is not the time.
Ryuuji: Just a little longer... Hmmm... It'll be time soon...
Andou: Hey, you! What are you doing?
Amano: Drop what's in your hands and freeze!
Ishikawa Hachirou: Hâ€”How did you...
Ishikawa Hachirou: Agh... C'mon, don't just stand there! Take them out! Get rid of these two, and we'll be home free!
Amano: Hah! A measly few Treasure Hoarders, and you're getting cocky already?
Ryuuji: Andou, Amano, let us take care of them!
Andou: Okay! They're all yours!
Ryuuji: Traveler, now's the time.
Traveler: Bah. So complicated...
Ryuuji: It's Sango's plan.
Ryuuji: Well then. Let's do this.
Traveler: Should we nab him?
Ryuuji: In a moment. It's not the time yet.

## Talk 3

Andou: Now we've caught him red-handed. Thanks for the help, Ryuuji, Traveler.
Andou: Amano and I will take these Treasure Hoarders back to the police station. We'll handle the rest of the case.
Amano: It's amazing how Sango could figure out the details of the case so accurately...
Andou: Well, it is Sango. A case like this is no big deal to her, no doubt.
Andou: Ryuuji, we'll head back to the police station first. We'll pay you a visit when we're done with this guy.
Ryuuji: My pleasure. Take care.
Ryuuji: Traveler, let's go back and report to Sango.

## Talk 4

Ryuuji: ...And Andou and Amano are taking the culprit back to the police station as we speak, Sango.
Sango: I see. Then it's settled.
Sango: Traveler, thank you for your help.
Traveler: So... that's it?
Sango: It's normal to feel that way. After all, it was Amano and Andou who took the criminal away. Why don't you take your pay? It'll help all this feel more real.
Traveler: What about your payment?
Sango: Me? The biggest reward for me is helping the police solve a case and bringing peace and security to the city.
Sango: But to be honest, I didn't gain much of anything this time.
Sango: I didn't get to see any new criminal techniques or ideas.
Sango: It was an uninteresting crime. Luckily it didn't take much effort.
Traveler: Sango...
Sango: Hmm? Is this the first time you've met someone who is interested in crime the way I am?
Sango: It's this fascination that made me decide to become a detective.
Traveler: Do you want to commit "crimes," too?
Sango: Yes, in a way, I do. I wish to commit a flawless, perfect crime.
Sango: However... it's inevitable that some evidence will be left behind during a crime, and as long as there is evidence, it is only a matter of time before the crime is solved.
Traveler: What if the crime isn't committed by a person?
Sango: See! You can't help but think about committing crimes too, right?
Sango: Don't be nervous. You're just thinking about it.
Sango: I think about crimes all the time, like how and why they are committed...
Traveler: Why do you think like that?
Sango: To better solve cases, of course. The cases I've been working on lately have been getting more complicated, so I've had to give them a lot of thought.
Sango: However, none of those cases can be called perfect.
Traveler: Have you ever seen a perfect crime?
Sango: Yes, I have. There was a perfect crime that I haven't been able to solve to this day.
Sango: But I believe that as long as it was done by a person, there must be some evidence. It's just that I haven't found any yet.
Sango: Anyway, here is your payment. Thank you for helping me, Traveler.
Sango: Feel free to come here whenever you have time. But if you're too busy... well... that's okay too.
Sango: Still, my gut tells me that we will have the chance to join forces again.
Traveler: What if the culprit doesn't exist?
Traveler: Is there any way to erase your traces?
Traveler: Is this how all detectives are?
Sango: I wouldn't generalize, but I am very interested in "crime."
Traveler: You don't want anything?
Sango: I've already tasted the sweetness of justice. I don't need anything else...
Sango: Hehe... I suppose that sounds better, doesn't it?
Traveler: Just like that?...

## Talk 5

Sango: If you go now, you should be able to catch him red-handed. I'll wait here for your good news.
Sango: Is there anything else you want to say, Traveler?
Traveler: You don't look too excited.
Sango: This case is pretty uninteresting: it has a boring perpetrator, and the methods lack sophistication.
Sango: If I had to rate this case... it's a total snore.
Sango: But again, it's a crime, so it's good that it gets dealt with.
Traveler: Aren't you coming along?
Sango: My part is done, so I'll stay out of it.
Sango: Besides, with my fighting skills and physique, I could be taken hostage by the culprit, which he could then use to get what he wants. That would be the worst.
Sango: I know my limits, so I'll leave it to you to deal with him.
