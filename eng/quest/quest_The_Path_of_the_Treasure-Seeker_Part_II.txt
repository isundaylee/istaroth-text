# The Path of the Treasure-Seeker... Part II?


## Talk 1

Ulman: *sigh* Seriously, am I some sort of Seelie magnet?
Ulman: Oh, it's... it's you, Traveler! Fancy meeting you here as well!
Traveler: ...Um, who are you?
Ulman: Come on, it's me, Ulman! We teamed up to look for treasure before, remember?
Ulman: ...Right, the Treasure-Seeking Seelie! You remember that at least, right?
Traveler: Sure. Why are you here in Inazuma?
Ulman: Ahem. So, uh... You remember how you found me all those Iron Coins during our last partnership, yes?
Ulman: I had them sold off and made a tidy sum of Mora myself... Hehe. Thanks for that, by the way.
Ulman: But as you know, there're always ways and means of spending Mora. I've quite spent the whole amount by now...
Ulman: Not to mention how I no longer had a Treasure-Seeking Seelie, so there was no chance that I'd be able to find those Iron Coins without further help from you.
Ulman: So while I was cooking up some other way to finance myself...
Ulman: ...I heard from an, ah, acquaintance that Inazuma's a place chock-full of treasure, so I came here to try my luck.
Traveler: You know this is a closed country, right?
Ulman: Yes, yes, of course. Well... Let's just say that I have my ways.
Ulman: Now, where was I? Right. So I made arrangements with those "friends" of mine and got my hands on a boat for a fee. With that, I made ready to sail to Inazuma.
Ulman: *sigh* But the weather grew stranger the closer I drew to Inazuma. The thunder peeled and the storms roared...
Ulman: And bam! One lightning bolt from the sky hit my boat dead on, wrecking it, and I was hurled into the sea.
Ulman: Waves came crashing in. I got a few mouthfuls of seawater as I struggled before fainting. When I came to again, I was lying on the beach.
Traveler: You're one lucky man.
Ulman: Hahaha, you can say that I've always been this way.
Ulman: And, hmmm, how should I put this? So I had a look around once I'd reached shore, and...
Ulman: Somehow, I bumped into this little one again, and it helped me find a few treasures, to boot. So I thought, "oh, these must also be Treasure-Seeking Seelie..."
Ulman: But like the previous bunch, it also got tired after searching a few sites with treasures in them, and now it just circles around me over and over...
Traveler: It's this sort of Seelie again...
Ulman: I don't know either. Maybe I'm some sort of Seelie magnet?
Ulman: Or maybe there's something on my person that attracts them? I don't really get it either...
Ulman: But either way, now that I'm here, I'm not leaving empty-handed.
Ulman: According to the information I have, there should still be some treasure around. I've jotted the general areas down in my notebook.
Ulman: But since this fellow isn't looking too enthusiastic, I'd wager that it would be too tall a task for me...
Ulman: So, what say you partner up with your old buddy Ulman again, eh, Traveler? Your Treasure-Seeking Seelie should still be raring to go.
Ulman: Same deal as last time: I'll mark the spots for you, and you'll find the treasure for me. The items you find themselves are yours — I'll stake no claim on them.
Ulman: But if you find any Iron Coins, just bring those beauties to me, and I'll make sure to give you a good price for 'em.
Traveler: As long as the price is right.
Ulman: And it will be, friend, I assure you! We're long-time partners now, you can trust me!
Ulman: Here, take my notebook. Happy hunting, Traveler, and here's to a profitable partnership!
Traveler: Oh, you're the guy with the Treasure-Seeking Seelie...
Ulman: Right, that's me, Ulman. We teamed up in the past, remember?

## Talk 2

Ulman: *sigh* Seriously, am I some sort of Seelie magnet?
Traveler: What Seelie magnet?
Ulman: You're... the Traveler? Oh my, your timing is impeccable!
Ulman: Listen, I've got an earnest proposal. A profitable proposal, too. Interested, by any chance?
Traveler: Not going to keep it to yourself?
Ulman: Ah, come on, no need to be on your guard. Come on, I'm just an ordinary guy looking to make some money in Inazuma.
Ulman: But of course, Inazuma's a closed country, right? So I got together with some friends to come up with a plan. I got myself a boat that way, and prepared to cross the ocean and get to Inazuma.
Ulman: *sigh* But the weather grew stranger the closer I drew to Inazuma. The thunder peeled and the storms roared...
Ulman: And bam! One lightning bolt from the sky hit my boat dead on, wrecking it, and I was hurled into the sea.
Ulman: Waves came crashing in. I got a few mouthfuls of seawater as I struggled before fainting. When I came to again, I was lying on the beach.
Traveler: You're one lucky man.
Ulman: Hahaha, you can say that I've always been this way.
Ulman: And, hmmm, how should I put this? So I had a look around once I'd reached shore, and...
Ulman: I met this little fellow.
Traveler: A—A Seelie?
Ulman: A Treasure-Seeking Seelie, to be precise. As the name suggests, they are the best buddies of people who seek treasure.
Ulman: But for reasons I can't understand, it just decided to quit on me after finding a few treasure sites. Now it just spends its time circling around me.
Ulman: I've given it some thought, and I reckon that it has gotten sick of my slow rate of unearthing treasure, and is now looking for a new partner.
Ulman: If you're interested, Traveler, why don't you take up that role?
Traveler: I'm no expert in Seelie communications...
Ulman: Haha, it's not an issue, don't worry. I mean, look at this fellow, bouncing with excitement and all — I'd wager it's taken a liking to you!
Ulman: *cough* Well, more on that later. Either way, wanna try working with this Seelie?
Traveler: Couldn't hurt to try...
Ulman: Great! That makes two... no, three of us. Partners!
Ulman: Take this book with you. The locations I've marked out on them have treasure buried in them somewhere.
Ulman: But without a Treasure-Seeking Seelie, there's no way I'd be able to find them, so it's up to you, Traveler.
Traveler: And who shall the treasure go to?
Ulman: Well... The items you find themselves are yours — I'll stake no claim on them.
Ulman: But there's a chance that you'll unearth some Iron Coins while you're looking for treasure...
Ulman: If you find any of that ancient currency, please bring them to me.
Ulman: Most people won't take these, but I'll give you a good price for them.
Ulman: Well then. The books yours, and so's this Seelie.
Ulman: Happy hunting, Traveler... and here's to our profitable partnership!
Traveler: Guess we'll split the goods fifty-fifty?
Ulman: Oh ho, looks like you know the rules... But no, I'll decline my share of any treasure you find.
Traveler: As long it'll have me...
Traveler: Sounds suspect.
