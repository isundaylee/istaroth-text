Traveler: Is there anything you'd like to do?
Mika: Mmm... Let me think...
Mika: When the finch adeptus invited me over for some tea, she told me that you can use your willpower to change the topography here.
Mika: If you don't mind... could you find an open place and form one or two mountains there?
Mika: It doesn't matter what they look like â€” as long as it's something that you'd find difficult to climb. The craggier, the better.
Mika: But if that would take too much time and effort, just scrap the idea...
Traveler: You mean... you want to go on a hike?
Mika: Yes! I'm so grateful for the delicious food and the cozy accommodation you've provided, but I fear that I'll get out of shape if I'm too comfortable for too long...
Mika: I still have a long way to go before I can become a well-seasoned surveyor. I can't get complacent.
Mika: Besides, understanding the landforms you create will allow me to see what kind of terrain might pose a challenge to you, so I can prepare a plan accordingly.
Mika: This way, I'll soon be of some help!
Traveler: I'll give it a go when the time comes.
Mika: Great! Thank you.
Mika: Hearing that makes me really motivated!
Traveler: Let's challenge the most perilous of terrain together!
