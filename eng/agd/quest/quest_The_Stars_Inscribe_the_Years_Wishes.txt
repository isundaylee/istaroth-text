# The Stars Inscribe the Year's Wishes


## Talk 1

Xingqiu: Rest assured, all is quiet here in Qingce Village. Chongyun is guarding the outside, and I'm guarding the inside. Not a problem in sight.
Keqing: Good. I've made some progress in my investigation as well.
Xingqiu: Oh? What are you planning? Is it time to strike?
Traveler: Perfect timing!
Paimon: Let's go!
Keqing: Traveler, Paimon, you are just in time.
Keqing: I looked everywhere and I found some clues regarding the Treasure Hoarders. Besides wagon tracks, I also came across bits and pieces of fireworks packaging scattered on the road.
Keqing: Following those clues, I was able to finally locate the missing fireworks. But there was no sign of Treasure Hoarders.
Traveler: Hmm, did they run away?
Keqing: No, I think they might be just overly careless. I seem to have found the location where they've been stashing all their stolen goods. They must have thought it was well-hidden and deemed it unnecessary to post any guards.
Keqing: The amount of fireworks they've amassed there is astonishing. Not only did they steal the ones in Qingce Village but also from other locations, too. They've gathered all the stolen goods there.
Keqing: I've asked the Millelith on guard at Qingce Village to report this to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. They will organize a search around that warehouse.
Paimon: Now that the Millelith is involved, you don't need to handle this yourself anymore!
Keqing: The Treasure Hoarders are notoriously cunning, and they may even have lookouts. If they notice anything suspicious, they will move the fireworks and our single lead will be lost. I have to keep an eye on the situation.
Paimon: Uh, you're not really thinking that you can take all of them yourself, are you?
Keqing: No, I am not that reckless. I just want to investigate the case thoroughly.
Keqing: But now that I have your help, the idea is feasible...
Paimon: So you really are considering it!
Traveler: (We can't let Keqing try to handle this on her own.)
Keqing: Okay, then there's no time to lose. Let's go.
Traveler: They're just Treasure Hoarders, we can take 'em.
Traveler: Count me in!

## Talk 2

Xingqiu: Though they are merely a group of irksome bandits, please, exercise caution.

## Talk 3

Keqing: These Treasure Hoarders must have returned to check on the stolen fireworks.
Keqing: Please hide yourselves. Let's wait and see what happens.
Xiuyong: Hey Boss, you think we have enough fireworks now?
Xingxiu: Hah! Are you kidding? This ain't nowhere near enough!
Xiuyong: Uh, but Boss, if we want more fireworks, we'll have to steal 'em in the city! Ain't gonna be easy...
Xingxiu: Hmm... You got a point. Alright, then we steal those things that make a real loud bang but don't light up real pretty... What do they call 'em? Ah yeah, firecrackers! Those'll do the job!
Xingxiu: All we need to do is make some real ruckus.
Xingxiu: As long as we distract the Millelith, the other hoarders can do their end of the job. You get it?
Xiuyong: Got it, Boss! Hehe, I gotta hand it to ya, we're gonna hit the jackpot this time!
Xiuyong: But, uh Boss... All our boys are out scouting around. Don't ya think we need a few more to guard the stash?
Xingxiu: Hey, don't worry about it. The Millelith are swamped with Lantern Rite, they won't have time to come out here. Alright, move it boys! Just a few more batches and we'll be...
Junming: Uh-oh! Hey, Boss! We've got trouble!
Xingxiu: Huh!? What happened?
Junming: The jig is up, Boss! Th—The Millelith are coming! And it seems they've already caught our scouts!
Junming: If one of the boys hadn't set off a firework to warn us, we would've been completely blindsided! Boss, let's run!
Xingxiu: But how did the Millelith find out about us? And so quickly too!?
Xingxiu: Arg, fine! Leave the fireworks and let's split! They won't be catching us!
Keqing: It's time to make our move! Ready?
Traveler: I'm ready!
Paimon: Let's go!

## Talk 4

Keqing: Alright, so you want to do this the hard way.
Xingxiu: W—We surrender, Yuheng.
Keqing: Now, I want some answers. What were you planning to do with the stockpile of fireworks?
Xingxiu: Uh, w—we just...
Keqing: Tell the truth and I might go easy on you.
Xingxiu: We... *sigh* Fine.
Xingxiu: We were gonna smuggle these fireworks into the city and ignite them during the Lantern Rite's opening ceremony.
Xingxiu: The fireworks are really bright and loud, and would definitely raise some havoc. We were gonna rob the city while everyone's distracted by the explosions.
Xingxiu: But, uh... We didn't seem to have enough fireworks, so...
Keqing: Oh? So you mean you had more than one group of thieves stealing fireworks?
Xingxiu: Yeah, that's right... originally I had all the hoarders out stealing fireworks, but then one of them got caught by the Feiyun Commerce Guild and was arrested.
Xingxiu: I really didn't get it! Why did the Feiyun Commerce Guild get involved? We were only stealing from the government...
Xingxiu: No, what I meant is, uh... Well, I was worried that the guy who got arrested would rat us out.
Xingxiu: If word got out, we could lose everything. So I ordered most of our boys to come back.
Xingxiu: Who woulda guessed we'd end up runnin' into you like that...
Paimon: Hey! Didn't one of you just say that the Millelith were coming, too?
Junming: Yeah, that's right... I wonder how the Millelith found out we had dispatched scouts.
Junming: They somehow captured almost all of them... If someone hadn't alerted us, we would all have been caught.
Paimon: Well, you did get caught.
Junming: Well... uh, yeah...
Keqing: It appears that the Millelith managed to get the captured Treasure Hoarder to talk.
Keqing: There may still be other Treasure Hoarders in the area. We should head elsewhere, just to be safe.
Keqing: Traveler, please escort the Treasure Hoarders back to Qingce Village and hand them over to the Millelith stationed there.
Keqing: I'll be there once I am finished inspecting this place.
Traveler: Understood, please be careful.
Keqing: Yes, you too. I'll see you in Qingce Village.

## Talk 5

Pengyi: *sigh* This is the last batch of fireworks that I can get. Please ensure that there will be no further problems.
Jingcheng: Don't worry, the Yuheng will be taking care of this personally. And with us on guard, I assure you it'll be safe.
Xingqiu: Yes, indeed. Oh? It appears the Traveler has returned.
Xingqiu: And with two others, no doubt.
Traveler: They're the thieves who stole the fireworks.
Black Screen Text: You tell everyone how the thieves were caught...
Chongyun: It's definitely dangerous to infiltrate an enemy area like that. If only I was there to fight alongside you...
Xingqiu: Come now, we both know the Traveler is most capable. Hehe, but who would've known we performed such a noble deed... We had arrested the Treasure Hoarder earlier by mere happenstance.
Paimon: Yeah! Talk about a coincidence!
Xingqiu: It seems that justice always finds its way into the world. It is in fateful moments that miracles are born.
Pengyi: So it was you! You horrible brutes are the ones who stole the fireworks!? Just the sight of you two makes my blood boil...
Jingcheng: Please, calm down. I doubt they'll be causing any more trouble now that they're in custody. Thank you very much, Traveler. But may I ask, why has Lady Keqing not returned with you?
Paimon: Lady Keqing was worried there'd be more Treasure Hoarders lurking about. She wanted to conduct a full search of the area.
Jingcheng: Oh, I see... Yes, Lady Keqing is quite thorough. A squad of Millelith came by just now. I believe they were sent by the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
Jingcheng: I also heard that most of the fleeing Treasure Hoarders have already been apprehended, hopefully that will be the end of this matter.
Jingcheng: Anyway, you may leave these Treasure Hoarders to us. I will escort them back to the city and make sure they stand trial with the others.
Xingqiu: And thus our chapter has finally reached its timely conclusion. I am partial to fireworks myself, but I'm afraid we must also be leaving now.
Paimon: Huh? Why the hurry to get back to the Feiyun Commerce Guild? Don't tell us you have work to do, too...
Traveler: Are you also busy these days, Xingqiu?
Xingqiu: Inevitably, affairs do become busier around festive seasons. But no need to worry, we have many attendants to assist us... And there's always Chongyun, too.
Chongyun: Huh? You mean you're assigning more work to me?
Xingqiu: 'Tis only my duty as your dearest friend. Work before play, as they say. I am sure you understand.
Chongyun: Oh alright, I suppose...
Xingqiu: As the saying goes, "Many hands make light work." As long as work is assigned to the right people, everything will proceed without a hitch.
Chongyun: If you ask me, I think speaking eloquently is just a guise for assigning work to everybody else.
Xingqiu: Alright, alright. I shall treat you to a meal after the work is done!
Xingqiu: Farewell, Traveler.
Black Screen Text: Chongyun and Xingqiu leave with others from the guild.
Pengyi: By the way, do you know when Lady Keqing will be back, Traveler?
Pengyi: There are not many fireworks in the second batch that I brought, so I'm worried that we can't achieve the show's desired effect. I was hoping we could somehow retrieve the stolen fireworks.
Paimon: Hey, did you hear that explosion!? Maybe it was fireworks? *gasp* Or maybe more Treasure Hoarders!
Traveler: It came from Keqing's location!
Paimon: Oh no, maybe she ran into trouble! Let's go and help her!

## Talk 6

Keqing: Oops, what did I do?
Paimon: Hey! Keqing!
Traveler: Keqing!
Keqing: Huh? What Treasure Hoarders?
Paimon: We heard an explosion and thought it might be Treasure Hoarders sending signals to one another again.
Keqing: Ah, I see. Sorry, that's not the case. I saw a few sticks of fireworks on the ground, so I fiddled with them and...
Keqing: Sure enough, it seems I accidentally lit the fuse. Before I could react, the fireworks were... *ahem* already up in the air.
Traveler: Oh, I see.
Paimon: So, no enemies? Well, that's good... We thought you might've been surrounded by bad guys!
Keqing: I apologize, I didn't mean to alarm you. Fortunately, there are no more Treasure Hoarders in the area. It seems this matter has finally come to an end.
Paimon: Great! The case of the stolen fireworks is finally solved, good thing we were able to get to the bottom of it!
Paimon: Otherwise, those beautiful fireworks would have gone to waste and the whole show would be ruined.
Traveler: That's right.
Paimon: By the way, Keqing, you're the one in charge of the fireworks show, which means you know the best viewing spot, right?
Keqing: Yes, of course. The best view should be from the Jade Chamber.
Keqing: Don't worry, I haven't forgotten my promise. But first, I have to drop by the Ministry of Civil Affairs and close this case.
Keqing: Leave the rest of this to me, you've already been a great help. Why don't you go for a walk around the city and I'll meet you when I am done?
Paimon: Okay... But we'll be waiting for you!
Keqing: Yes, I'll be there.
Black Screen Text: Keqing leaves...
Paimon: *sigh* Keqing really is super busy.
Paimon: "I'll meet you when I am done." How many times have we heard that already?
Paimon: Now Paimon gets why Lady Ningguang is so worried about Keqing. If she keeps working like this, she really will miss the Lantern Rite.
Traveler: Hmm, let's go find Zhongli.
Paimon: Oh yeah, we said we would meet him! And we've even collected a few opinions about taking a rest from work.
Paimon: Zhongli said he'd wait for us at Third-Round Knockout. Let's go find him!
Traveler: Wait, where are the Treasure Hoarders?

## Talk 7

Paimon: Hey, is that who Paimon thinks it is...
Yun Jin: Yes, you are quite right, I shall take your wise words to heart, sir. They will certainly be most helpful in my next performance.
Zhongli: You are welcome, Ms. Yun. Your willingness to hear suggestions is indeed impressive. It's no wonder your opera performance has only been getting better.
Yun Jin: No, I'm afraid that's not always the case. Though I am still young, I can be quite arrogant at times. I do not always accept advice so readily, but your wisdom has spoken to me.
Paimon: Zhongli! We're back!
Zhongli: Ah, you've returned.
Yun Jin: Hmm? You are also acquaintances?
Paimon: Yes, we sure are!
Traveler: We've met on a couple of occasions.
Yun Jin: Not everyone gets the privilege of meeting someone so knowledgeable and discreet as Mr. Zhongli.
Yun Jin: You are indeed well-connected, Traveler.
Zhongli: I am flattered, Ms. Yun. It is an honor for an ordinary person like myself to have met the Traveler.
Paimon: Whoa, did he really just say that...
Traveler: (I wouldn't dare reveal his true identity.)
Yun Jin: I'm sure you must have matters to discuss. I have an appointment with Xinyan, so if you'll excuse me, I'll take my leave.
Zhongli: Very well. Goodbye, Ms. Yun.
Paimon: See you around, Yun Jin!
Zhongli: So, tell me, what have you learned from your trip?
Traveler: We asked around, and...
Black Screen Text: You tell Zhongli about everyone's views on work-life balance...
Zhongli: Hmm, I see. Well, Traveler, what do you make of all their opinions?
Traveler: I think we can weave them into a story.
Paimon: Yeah! Paimon already started creating her own story on the way here. The goal is to convince Keqing to rest more with just a simple story, right?
Paimon: If that's the case, then Paimon thinks we can use food as our theme!
Paimon: Think about it, who doesn't like delicious food? And when it comes to eating, everyone has an opinion. It's the perfect angle for our story!
Traveler: Simple but deep.
Paimon: Hehe, Paimon knows just what to write!
Paimon: Let's say there's a chef in Liyue who's very talented at cooking.
Paimon: He opens a massive restaurant in Liyue Harbor, and lots of customers come every day, so he's always super busy.
Paimon: Then, well... hmm... How should the story go from there?
Traveler: His food starts getting worse and worse?
Paimon: Oh, that's good! But wait, didn't we say he's really good at cooking? That wouldn't make sense...
Traveler: It's up to you, it's your story!
Zhongli: There's no need to jump to the conclusion. Why don't you elaborate more on the chef?
Paimon: More about the chef... You mean both good and bad things?
Zhongli: Yes. To gain one's empathy, there must be familiarity. I would like to understand this chef character of ours a little deeper.
Paimon: #Hmm, Paimon didn't think this far... Why don't you take it from here, Traveler?
Zhongli: Since you've spoken with others familiar with Keqing, why don't we integrate their thoughts into your story? That will allow it to become all the more convincing.
Paimon: Okay! Let Paimon think... What did Cloud Retainer say?
Paimon: "As one sows, so do they reap, and the joy of reaping is what one yearns for."
Zhongli: That was quite poetic, Paimon. Bravo.
Paimon: Hehe! Oh! Now Paimon remembers! Cloud Retainer said that if she spends all her efforts working on a machine with no time to test the outcome...
Paimon: Then she'd be like a chef who doesn't get to try their own food. Problems are bound to pop up.
Zhongli: Yes, it is most unwise to put the cart before the horse.
Paimon: Uh-huh, that's exactly what she said! So let's make that happen to the chef in the story... He's great at cooking, but he can't enjoy his own food.
Zhongli: Hmm, but there must be a reason why he doesn't partake in the delicacies he makes.
Paimon: Right, it's because he's super busy! He receives the customers, he takes the orders, and he does all the cooking himself...
Paimon: Hehe, that should keep him busy enough. He's so busy every day that he doesn't even have time to take a break, which obviously also means he doesn't have time to eat.
Traveler: That sounds a bit extreme...
Paimon: Hey, it's just a story! Besides, it's supposed to leave a powerful impression, kinda like fireworks!
Zhongli: Yes, the chef is unwilling to delegate tasks to others. He's overconfident about his own cooking abilities, and tries to accomplish everything on his own.
Paimon: Paimon already kinda feels sorry for him.
Traveler: "Many hands make light work!"
Paimon: Oh, right! That's what the chef doesn't understand!
Paimon: And there's another saying... erm... What was it, again?
Paimon: Oh yeah, "A rested worker is an efficient worker!" That's what Yanfei said.
Paimon: So the chef gets busier and busier. To the point where he can't stand up straight anymore and has big dark circles under his eyes. The customers tell him to take a few days off to get some rest, but the chef won't listen.
Zhongli: His judgment is clouded by the chores before him. He is oblivious to mountains in the distance, the bigger picture.
Paimon: Eventually, the chef falls ill and his cooking becomes far worse than when he started. The customers can't convince him to rest and they don't like his cooking anymore, so they stop coming to his restaurant.
Traveler: ...
Zhongli: Rest is always of great importance. Although we may come across various difficulties in our lives, pushing ourselves is never a good modus operandi.
Zhongli: The story is simple without embellishment, yet deeply meaningful. If our listener is sensible, then she should quickly grasp the meaning contained within.
Paimon: You're saying... Paimon made a good story!?
Zhongli: Sincerity can allow one to see clearly, and earnest advice can provide sound direction. The story is indeed good.
Zhongli: The Yuheng is an adroit leader. I am certain she will understand the message you are trying to convey.
Paimon: Really? Score one for Paimon!
Zhongli: Given that the case involving the Treasure Hoarders has come to an end, she is inevitably tired. Now will be the ideal moment to speak with her.
Zhongli: If all goes well, I think your story will be a success.
Paimon: Hear that? Zhongli says Paimon's story has what it takes! If anyone knows a good story, he does!
Paimon: Quick, let's go find Keqing!
Traveler: The consequences of not getting enough rest are pretty serious.
Traveler: Classic Paimon wisdom.

## Talk 8

Keqing: The matter has finally come to an end, but we mustn't lower our guard. Increase patrols around Qingce Village and coordinate our people at other fireworks locations to prevent any further theft.
Jingcheng: Yes, Lady Keqing.
Keqing: And by the way, the Ministry has requested the Millelith to increase security along travel routes. How is that proceeding?
Jingcheng: It's all been taken care of. However, due to various reasons, there are still some blind spots in the city.
Keqing: Have we drafted a new patrol map? Please give me a copy and I'll look it over when I have time.
Jingcheng: Understood! The patrol map is still being drafted, but it will be ready soon.
Keqing: Okay. Also, I...
Jingcheng: Oh, excuse me, Lady Keqing... Your friends are here.
Paimon: Hi Keqing, still working? Aren't we going to see the fireworks?
Keqing: Oh, yes, but I thought we'd meet at the Jade Chamber. Why have you come here?
Traveler: You told us to walk and have a look around.
Paimon: Yeah, we walked around the city just like you told us to, it's very nice. But, it would be even nicer if you could join us! Do you still have work to do?
Keqing: It's nothing urgent, really, just some trivial matters. But I wish to get it done as soon as possible...
Jingcheng: You can leave it to us, Lady Keqing. You've been working hard for a long time, so you should get some rest. If I'm not mistaken, the Traveler is here to remind you to take a break.
Traveler: And we have something to tell you, Keqing.
Paimon: That's right! Something so important that we must speak with you personally, right now!
Keqing: Oh, really? In that case... Jingcheng, I'll let you take charge, thank you.
Jingcheng: Understood, I'll handle things from here.
Keqing: Traveler and Paimon, let's go to the Jade Chamber. The view there is nicer and it's much more private, perfect for talking.

## Talk 9

Keqing: Well, here we are.
Keqing: What was it you wanted to talk about?
Traveler: We have a story to tell you.
Paimon: Yeah! We want to tell you a story from this beautiful view. Whaddya say?
Keqing: Alright, I'm listening.
Paimon: So, it turns out we just heard some big news in Teyvat! A very talented chef is in trouble!
Keqing: Oh? Is the chef from Liyue? From Liuli Pavilion or Xinyue Kiosk, perhaps?
Paimon: No, no. Uh, the chef is from... Mondstadt! Yeah, and he's really, really good!
Paimon: He had a restaurant right next to the city gate. He was super efficient and his cooking was really delicious, so his restaurant had been getting more and more popular.
Paimon: In fact, he became so busy that the worker from the florist next door asked him, "Sir, why don't you find someone to help you in the restaurant?"
Paimon: But the chef brushed the idea aside, saying that he's the only one that can turn top-quality ingredients into world-class dishes, no one could help him.
Keqing: Hmm. Well, confidence is an essential trait for a good chef. He must be an excellent cook.
Paimon: That's what everyone was saying... But surprisingly, after just six months, no one would dine in his restaurant anymore.
Keqing: Oh?
Paimon: Shocking, right? Do you have any guess why?
Keqing: Hmm. Maybe the chef had fallen ill, or...
Paimon: #Wrong answer! You tell her, Traveler!
Traveler: Because he was too stubborn.
Paimon: Ding ding ding! Yep, it's because the chef was too stubborn!
Paimon: He would keep himself busy every day, and try to make the most delicious dishes for all his guests. But, he forgot that he's only human and needs time to eat and rest.
Paimon: He was so busy that he didn't even have time to eat and couldn't even taste his own cooking.
Paimon: He was unwilling to seek help even when he's tired, because he thought he's the only one capable of cooking the best dishes.
Paimon: Eventually, the people around him felt like they couldn't help him anyway, so they just left. And because he had forgotten the original taste of his dishes, he was no longer a good chef.
Paimon: In the end, his restaurant had no choice but to close for good.
Keqing: Oh...
Keqing: I see. He's overly confident, which disappoints the people around him, and he's so impatient that he ends up losing sight of his original purpose.
Keqing: *sigh*...
Keqing: So, that's the whole story?
Paimon: Oh, umm... Yep, that's the whole thing.
Traveler: Sorry, it's not a very good story.
Paimon: Hey! Didn't you just say that Paimon made a great story!?
Keqing: Hmm? Did you come up with that story?
Paimon: Oh! N—No, we just, uh...
Keqing: Heh...
Keqing: Hmm, how should I describe it... The story is very simple, and I suppose the ending isn't really surprising.
Traveler: Huh!?
Keqing: Think before you act and don't overexert yourself. Of course, I understand these concepts in theory, but when tasks come to me personally, it is easy to lose sight of the bigger picture.
Traveler: It's as if "your judgment is clouded," right?
Keqing: Yes. Up in the mountains, we can see the mist in the clouds. Out in the ocean, we can see fog on the sea. That's why from time to time, we need to examine where we are, remove the fog, and feel our heart.
Paimon: So, how do you feel now, Keqing?
Keqing: How do I feel?
Keqing: Hmm...
Keqing: Deep down inside, I wish I could slow down time. That way, I could finally take the opportunity to walk around the city, see the people I wish to see, and watch the fireworks.
Keqing: Thinking back, I used to be even more impatient. My colleagues would resign after just three months of working with me.
Keqing: You're completely right. It's important to know your boundaries.
Keqing: But, I am getting better! You can tell, can't you?
Keqing: And I did make a promise with you, didn't I?
Keqing: We agreed to enjoy the fireworks show together this year. So...
Traveler: So...?
Keqing: Happy Lantern Rite, Traveler and Paimon, I'm very happy to be here and enjoy this moment together with you.
Keqing: I've poured all my best effort into this fireworks show. And now that we're here, I sincerely hope you will enjoy it.
Keqing: I feel very fortunate to be right here, enjoying the fireworks, and enjoying the view of Liyue Harbor.
Traveler: Happy Lantern Rite, Keqing.
Paimon: Happy Lantern Rite!
Keqing: Happy Lantern Rite. And... thank you.
Traveler: Please don't laugh at us.
