Traveler: Err, you are...
Antoine: Antoine Roger's the name, and clockwork engineering's the game. My specialty? The eternal dream of humanity: flight!
Antoine: Now, you might be curious, and rightly so, as to how this might be different from Edwin Eastinghouse's research. In which case, let me explain!
Antoine: I generate propulsion using energy converted from the annihilation reaction between pneuma and ousia, which powers my aircraft's movement!
Antoine: What do you think? If you'd like to give it a try, hop aboard the Antoine Roger Aircraft and activate it using an annihilation reaction!
Antoine: It will move along the designated path â€” accident-free travel guaranteed!
