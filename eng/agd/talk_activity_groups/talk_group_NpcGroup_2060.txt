Huihui: Why do you fans of Yue cuisine always have to bad-mouth Li cuisine?
Hao: You Li lovers started it when you said Yue food was disgusting!
Huihui: But Yue food IS disgusting... You guys practically take raw fish straight out of the sea and swallow them whole! What you call the "rich aroma of fresh seafood," I call the "pungent odor of dead fish..." There is no flavor profile because it all tastes the same...
Hao: Oh yeah? Well every Li dish is pretty much a plate of Jueyun Chilis that have been buried in salt for half the week! "Rugged essence of the mountains"? More like "essence of mountain lion clawing at back of throat"!
Huihui: How can you say that? You clearly have no taste when it comes to food. All that Yue cooking has completely ruined your palate!
Hao: Hmph, you're clearly only saying that because you've never properly tried Yue food before. I bet you've never even BEEN to the Xinyue Kiosk!
Huihui: And I bet YOU have never had proper Li cuisine at Liuli Pavilion!
