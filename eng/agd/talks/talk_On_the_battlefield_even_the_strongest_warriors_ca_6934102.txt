Gorou: On the battlefield, even the strongest warriors can be captured if they get isolated, and even the weakest soldiers can conquer the enemy if they stay united.
Gorou: There's only so much one person can accomplish on their own. So my view is that the strength of the whole group is what matters if you want to build an unstoppable army.
Gorou: Likewise, even the fiercest enemy soldier is nothing to be feared. As long as we work together as a team and make effective use of our resources, victory will be ours!
