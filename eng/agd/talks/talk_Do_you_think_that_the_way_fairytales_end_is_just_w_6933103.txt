Yanfei: Do you think that the way fairytales end is just whimsical? Or do you think the writers put a lot of thought into it?
Yanfei: Because if you read them from the point of view of trying to identify what each character symbolically represents, you find a lot of very deep metaphors.
Yanfei: Still, in order to verify my hypothesis and see if it stands up to scrutiny, I need to do some historical and cultural research... Maybe I could borrow some of these materials here so I can do a deep-dive later.
