Traveler: Herbad?
Hosseini: Ah, that is an honorific we use for researchers. Those who earn the name Herbad are knowledgeable beyond the pale, leaders among scholars.
Hosseini: In my department, the number of great talents who study alchemy and the function of the ley lines are many indeed.
Hosseini: By contrast, I am not their equal in talent. Truly, I wonder if I can ascend to such heights within my lifetime...
Hosseini: But if I can, then perhaps I might be able to join such luminaries as the great Pursina and the sagacious Ayesha, and bestow my name upon the fruits of my research, to be used by future generations...
Hosseini: And there will be Hosseini Machines, Hosseini Methods, and Hosseini Formulas used throughout the scholarly realms of Sumeru...
Hosseini: Ah, just thinking about it makes my soul sing!
