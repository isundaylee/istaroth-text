Traveler: "Resurrecting King Deshret"?
Feroz: Pfft. A foolish notion!
Feroz: Toying with life and death is a futile endeavor!
Feroz: If King Deshret would so easily rise up from a pile of sand and dust, could little sprouts that have just broken the soil not immediately grow into monumental trees?
Feroz: King Deshret is long gone. Those wannabes claim the name of the Eremites in vain if they can't even face up to that fact!
Feroz: Death is the fairest thing in the world. Whether a god high above or a bug down in the dirt, it comes for everyone all the same.
