Nilou: Ahh, warm lighting, fun stories to read... It's perfect. Oh, not that there's anything wrong with the House of Daena, of course.
Nilou: It's just that... The books there are pretty tough-going, and I tend to get so sleepy reading them that no amount of balloons can help me. And then I usually start getting hungry...
Nilou: I think... Maybe the fairytales here are more my kind of thing.
