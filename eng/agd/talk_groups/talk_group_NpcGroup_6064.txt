Traveler: Do a lot of people come to you for help?
Kahuna: There was no shortage even before, but after the war, the number of missing people commissions increased significantly. I'm sure you understand...
Kahuna: It's not all bad news, though. Being able to help people find their lost friends and loved ones, and seeing their excitement when they're reunited... It makes me feel happy too.
Kahuna: As for the others... well, let's not bring that up for now. Some of the loss of contact might just be temporary. Perhaps they'll just turn up back at home someday, completely out of the blue?

Traveler: Hmm?
Kahuna: Ah, so you're not a client. Sorry about that.
Kahuna: I just know a ton of people, so over time, people have habitually come to me when they need something or someone found.
Kahuna: If you need help hiring a wayfinder, feel free to contact me. I'll be around here all day, more or less.
Kahuna: Also, don't worry about fees. I'm just helping out.

Traveler: What do you mean by "wayfinder"...?
Kahuna: Oh, I mean a whole bunch of People of the Springs who love exploring Natlan.
Kahuna: If you think about it carefully, their job scope is similar to that of adventurers, they just call themselves something else.
Kahuna: As you know, our lands are rife with high-temperature regions, and people of our tribe can explore all sorts of places with the aid of our Koholasaurs.
Kahuna: As such, many from other tribes and tourists alike will hire wayfinders for convenience, whether as navigators or scouts.

Kahuna: Gah! Can't believe I agreed to switch for the night shifts with that kid. What a mess...

Traveler: About my reputation with the People of the Springs...
Kahuna: Ah, a friend, come to help! My thanks.

### Talk 5 related talk 1

Traveler: Hello. What is this place?
Kahuna: This is the Obsidian Totem Pole. You might have seen ones like it in other tribes, but this one belongs to us, the People of the Springs.
Kahuna: After you complete tribal commissions, the Pole will grant you corresponding recompense — and you'll also have my thanks on behalf of our tribe.
Kahuna: As for anything else, go find Caramuru during the day shift! Can't be letting our primary appointment holder get off scot-free, you know?

### Talk 5 related talk 2

Traveler: You can't swap back?
Kahuna: Well, that wouldn't change much, in truth. It's either the day shift or the night one, you know?
Kahuna: And this is an important spot, so someone's got to watch it.
Kahuna: I still wanna give Caramuru a smack over the head, of course, but I'm the responsible one between us!
