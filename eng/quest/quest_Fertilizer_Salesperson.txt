# Fertilizer... Salesperson?


## Talk 1

Iwata: *sigh* I do hope I succeed this time...

## Talk 2

Iwata: Thank you, Traveler, thank you...
Iwata: I was halfway through making the fertilizer when those monsters came charging up out of nowhere...
Iwata: That's so strange... But it's good that you showed up when you did.
Traveler: It might be because of that pile of fertilizer, you know...
Iwata: R—Really? I've heard that this smell is a sign that you might have succeeded.
Iwata: Well, in any case, come over here and have a look at the fertilizer. I'll explain as I open it up...
Gorou: Hold it!
Iwata: Eh? Mr. Gorou? I wasn't aware that you'd be passing this way today.
Traveler: On patrol, Gorou?
Gorou: I... Uh, never mind that first.
Gorou: Is this pile of... stuff your doing?
Iwata: Hahaha, yes. This fertilizer was the work of our hands.
Iwata: Mr. Gorou, did you come here to check on the fertilizer as well?
Iwata: Hehe, in that case, let's...
Gorou: Wait! Hold on a moment. I'm not here for that. Wait, actually, I am... But...
Paimon: Gorou's face is twisting up something awful...
Traveler: Let's... adjourn to someplace a little further away...
Gorou: Alright, let's do that.
Iwata: So, Mr. Gorou, why are you here?
Gorou: Lately, a lot of residents have been complaining of a terrifying stench nearby...
Gorou: So for safety, I came to investigate, and wound up following the smell all the way here.
Gorou: That's how I found you.
Gorou: Iwata, I've heard that you've been researching fertilizer, but the way that you're going about it is...
Traveler: ...A disturbance to the peace?
Gorou: Basically. Either way, Iwata, could you please dispose of that fertilizer? We'll try to help you find some other way.
Ookubo Daisuke: Sir! General Gorou!
Gorou: I'm here. What's happened?
Ookubo Daisuke: General, we caught a suspicious person out in the outskirts.
Ookubo Daisuke: She was acting very furtively, calling herself a... fertilizer salesperson, or somesuch.
Ookubo Daisuke: I thought that was awful strange, so I had this person detained. I thought that you might wish to see to her questioning.
Gorou: Fertilizer this, fertilizer that... What is it with me and fertilizer today...
Gorou: I've got it. I'll be with you shortly. Head back first and help to maintain order.
Gorou: Iwata, please deal with the matter of the fertilizer. We'll discuss this further later.
Gorou: Traveler, why don't you come with me?
Traveler: Doesn't seem like there's anything else to do.
Paimon: Someone selling fertilizer? Paimon can't help feel like that's familiar somehow... Nothing's coming to mind, though...
Paimon: Ah well, whatever. Let's just go over there and see what's up!
Traveler: A fertilizer... salesperson?
Traveler: ...Far too intense?

## Talk 3

Iwata: *sigh* Fertilizers are much trickier than I thought...

## Talk 4

Hiroyuki: Stay right there and don't move!
Alrani: I—I'm not moving! You asked me to explain, and I explained that I'm really a researcher from the Akademiya!
Hiroyuki: Didn't you say that you're advertising fertilizer?
Alrani: I... Can't a researcher from the Akademiya also advertise for fertilizers? Just... Just listen to me for a moment, will you...
Gorou: Is this the person?
Ookubo Daisuke: Yes, sir.
Ookubo Daisuke: When we caught her, she was sneaking around the place and wouldn't stop writing certain things down.
Ookubo Daisuke: General, I'm positive that she's a Shogunate spy!
Alrani: I'm not! And I wasn't! I already told you, I'm a researcher! I was just collecting material for my thesis!
Hiroyuki: Cut the crap! Do you seriously expect us to believe that you'd walk into a battlefield over a thesis? You're definitely playing at something else!
Alrani: ...What could I really dare to play at other than my thesis anyway...
Traveler: Oh, it's you...
Alrani: Traveler! Oh, this is wonderful! Please tell them I'm not a bad person! I'm just here to write my thesis!
Gorou: You know her?
Traveler: Well, you could say that...
Gorou: Does "graduating" really drive researchers from Sumeru this far up the wall...
Gorou: But given what you've said, you're only acquaintances at best.
Gorou: And as for her status as a "researcher from Sumeru," that's something you only heard from her, isn't it?
Traveler: That's correct.
Gorou: Hmm... I'm afraid that none of the evidence here is conclusive.
Gorou: But if she's got your guarantee, I'd wager that she isn't a bad person...
Ookubo Daisuke: General, if I may make a suggestion?
Ookubo Daisuke: Do you remember Kaushik? That researcher who's been studying our island's culture and history?
Ookubo Daisuke: He's been here all this while, and his credentials are quite solid... Why don't we ask him to tell if this... fertilizer saleswoman is actually a researcher or not?
Gorou: That actually sounds like a decent plan. Traveler, could we trouble you to bring Kaushik here?
Gorou: Just in case of any incidents, I'll stay here and guard this... fertilizer saleswoman.
Traveler: Alright.
Gorou: It's up to you then. Come back as quickly as possible.
Traveler: Alrani?

## Talk 5

Alrani: I... I'm just here to write a thesis. How in the world did I end up locked up again...

## Talk 6

Kaushik: The meaning of this totem... Hmm? Traveler? Did you have some business with me?
Traveler: This is about Alrani...
Kaushik: Alrani's here? On Watatsumi Island? That's... odd. What's that girl doing here? Shouldn't she be in Liyue?
Traveler: She was arrested by some soldiers...
Kaushik: What? *sigh* Of course. Coming to Watatsumi Island under the present circumstances... Of course they would suspect her.
Kaushik: Never mind that for now. Let's head over and help that reckless girl out...

## Talk 7

Kaushik: Alrani! It really is you! B—But why are you here in Inazuma? Weren't you supposed to be in Liyue?
Alrani: This... Oh, this is going to be long story, isn't it...
Gorou: Mr. Kaushik, you know Alrani?
Kaushik: Oh, you... you're General Gorou, aren't you?
Kaushik: You surmise correctly. Alrani and I are both researchers from the Akademiya.
Kaushik: After that, we left the Akademiya to conduct fieldwork for our own areas of research. I didn't think that I'd meet her here...
Gorou: But... Um, can you researchers just freely leave the Akademiya?
Kaushik: I wouldn't call it "leaving freely." Alrani and I are both Driyosh.
Kaushik: To us, wandering and learning are part of our research process, and as such, we are permitted to leave the Akademiya.
Kaushik: General Gorou, I can guarantee that Alrani is telling the truth...
Gorou: Alright, then there's no problem.
Alrani: Phew... I'm saved... Thank you so much...
Gorou: Hiroyuki, Ookubo, this matter is settled. Go attend to your own duties.
Hiroyuki: Yes, sir.
Ookubo Daisuke: Yes, sir.
Gorou: I'm sorry, Miss Alrani. We mistook you for someone suspicious.
Gorou: That said, while we have cleared your name, your barging into Watatsumi Island like this has made no shortage of trouble for us.
Alrani: Eh? Are... Are you going to fine me? I—I don't have very much Mora on me...
Gorou: Well, since you did claim to be a fertilizer salesperson earlier, and you're a researcher to boot...
Gorou: Well, there is something you can do for us. We have a man named Iwata living here who's researching fertilizer. Miss Alrani, please lend him a hand.
Gorou: If you can help him produce some fertilizer that isn't also a public disturbance, then you're free to do research here, just like Mr. Kaushik.
Alrani: F—Fertilizer? Wait, I... I'm just...
Traveler: She'll be fine!
Kaushik: Alrani, this is a good opportunity to collect research material. Since you're here in Inazuma, that must mean that your thesis is still...
Alrani: Uh... Ugh...
Kaushik: You know what the standards for graduation are at the Akademiya. If you can't graduate several years in a row...
Alrani: I—I'll do it! I'll do it, alright?
Alrani: I—I've learned about the fertilizer at Mr. Vahid's... I'll get this done in one go, just you all watch!
Traveler: Graduation begets character growth...
Gorou: Well, then we'll call this a day for now. Miss Alrani, the fertilizer matter is in your hands. I've got some other matters to handle, so if you'll excuse me...
Gorou: Ah, yes. Please remind Iwata to, uh, move his fertilizer a bit further away.
Kaushik: Alright, I'll continue with my research now. If you have any questions, Alrani, just feel free to ask me.
Traveler: Graduation equals strong motivation...
Traveler: You got this, Alrani.

## Talk 8

Iwata: Traveler, you're back. I've disposed of that pile of fertilizer.
Iwata: *sigh* I suppose I'll have to find another place to conduct my experiments...
Iwata: Hmm? This person is...
Traveler: An assistant Gorou found you.
Alrani: Hello, I'm Alrani...
Alrani: Well, either way... The general they called Gorou requested that I assist you with your fertilizer research.
Alrani: It's a pleasure to be working with you from now on.
Iwata: Is that so... That's great! If we succeed, then we'll be able to plant more crops here on Watatsumi Island!
Traveler: Do remember to pile the fertilizer further away.
Iwata: Eh? Oh! Oh, I get it.
Iwata: Yes, the pleasure is all mine, Miss Alrani!
Alrani: Yeah, I'll do my best.
Alrani: I'll do my best. This is for my thesis...
Traveler: A fertilizer specialist from Sumeru.
Alrani: Hello there, I'm Alrani... Wait a moment. A fertilizer specialist?
Alrani: I... I just learned a little about them.

## Talk 9

Gorou: Bring Kaushik back with you. The sooner the better...
