# Missing title (845741223)

Traveler: Tell me about your battle trophies.
Zhang Shun: Of all of them, this cup here is probably the one I'll never forget. Brings back memories of my drinking days.
Zhang Shun: ...But to be honest, now that I've decided to settle down and have a normal life, having it around only makes me sad that those days are over, which doesn't really help me move on.
Zhang Shun: Thanks for listening to me for so long. Actually, why don't I give this to you? Maybe it'll come in handy on one of your adventures.
