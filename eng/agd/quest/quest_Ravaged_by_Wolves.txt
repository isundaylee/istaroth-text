# Ravaged by Wolves


## Talk 1

Draff: Oh dear... This is awful, poor lad can't even stand.
Amber: That's terrible!
Paimon: Except... he's not actually injured...
Draff: Right. It's awful, the wolves frightened him so badly that he's paralyzed with fear.
Amber: That... really is awful.
Amber: Do you remember any significant details of what you saw?
Hopkins the Marvelous: I—I've never seen a wolf in my life before today, it was terrifying...
Amber: ...No details then, huh?
Amber: Let's investigate the area again.

## Talk 2

Paimon: These claw marks...
Paimon: From them, we can tell the number and size of the wolves.
Paimon: This time there were at least two wolves, and they must be...
Traveler: Be what?
Paimon: Yes, yes! They must be at least... two meters high!
Traveler: ...Paimon, you do know what a wolf is, right?
Paimon: Hey! Wolves are mysterious creatures, it's not like you see them every day.

## Talk 3

Paimon: This is a wolf's tooth.
Paimon: He must have smashed into the door when he pounced.
Traveler: Perhaps it's calcium deficient.
Paimon: Anyway, seems pretty lucky how no one in the village got seriously injured.

## Talk 4

Amber: Wolf fur... I heard that in Liyue they make calligraphy brushes out of this stuff.
Amber: The color looks nothing like Mondstadt wolf fur, based on what the books say. Could it be that they're from somewhere else entirely?
Paimon: Hair looks different at every place on the body, same applies to wolves. You don't know where it's from...
Amber: But look at this—
Paimon: Another hair. But what's that stuck to it?
Traveler: A seed.
Amber: It's the seed of a Wolfhook berry. Look, there are little hooks on the seed.
Amber: The only places this grows in Mondstadt are Wolvendom and Brightcrown Canyon.
Paimon: So it's Wolvendom wolves after all?
Amber: From that area, yes, but it could be that there are other wolf packs encroaching on their territory.
Amber: This doesn't tell us everything, but it does give us a strong lead. Enough to start investigating.
Amber: I'll go and see to the villagers before we head off.
Traveler: Is there something special about it?

## Talk 5

Hopkins the Marvelous: How is your investigation coming along?
Paimon: Wha— You're standing!
Hopkins the Marvelous: I have recovered, thankfully. I managed to claw my way back out of the depths of hell.
Hopkins the Marvelous: So, Knights of Favonius — what have you found out?
Amber: From inspecting wolf fur left at the scene, we can tell that the wolves came from Wolvendom. Beyond that, we don't know anything.
Amber: But please remain calm. I will head to Wolvendom shortly and get to the bottom of this.
Amber: The Knights of Favonius will not allow this danger to continue any longer.
Hopkins the Marvelous: Good. Better late than never I suppose.
Paimon: How rude!
Hopkins the Marvelous: In the meantime, we'll just have to keep dealing with this on our own.
Amber: Please, don't do anything stupid.
Hopkins the Marvelous: Hah! We do things a bit differently around here, you lot from the order probably aren't used to it. They will pay for what they've done!
Hopkins the Marvelous: Goodbye!
Draff: It's awful, it really is...
Paimon: What is?
Draff: Their future outlook, I mean.
Traveler: I agree.
Draff: Young people can be so impulsive sometimes. If it's not too much to ask, I hope you can keep an eye on them, stop them from getting into trouble.
Amber: It's no trouble — that's what we're here for. Even though that guy really isn't much of a charmer.
Amber: Leave it to us.
Paimon: Off to Wolvendom we go!
