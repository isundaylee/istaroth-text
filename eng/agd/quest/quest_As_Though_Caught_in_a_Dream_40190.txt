(Quest is part of chapter: Enchanted Tales of the Mikawa Festival: First Night As Though Caught in a Dream)

# As Though Caught in a Dream


## Talk 1

Ioroi: Kichiboushi and the others are young, so their speaking ability is limited... I miss the days when the bake-danuki could run circles around the humans.
Ioroi: Hold on, how were you able to understand them from the start? Does that mean the Bake-Danuki Meal from last time is still working...? Hah, take that, sneaky kitsune!
Ioroi: Speaking of... *sniff, sniff* That kitsune is gone, yes? Good. I have a request, young one. Come closer...
Ioroi: You must protect the cubs from that sneaky kitsune at all costs!!!

## Talk 2

Kamisato Ayato: The Lady Guuji is very... imaginative. There's no telling how the festival will end up in the end.
Traveler: She can be a handful...
Kamisato Ayato: I wouldn't go that far. Though outlandish at times, her ideas usually contain strokes of genius that can be quite practical in the end.
Kamisato Ayato: Besides, with you and Ayaka involved in the event, trust that I will intervene if things get out of hand. You need not worry.

## Talk 3

Yae Miko: Oh? Back so soon? Did you want to withhold judgment until they're done?

## Talk 4

Thoma: Hmm, we need to fine tune some things if we want to take home that award... Should we add a few more mechanisms?
Hitotsume Kozou: Anything for Boss Thoma!
Youko: Boss Thoma is the best!
Kappa: Great idea, Boss Thoma!
"Shousei": Boss Thoma is best!

## Talk 5

Paimon: Huh? A letter from Miko? What is she plotting this time... Well, let's open it and take a look!

## Talk 6

Paimon: ...Tenshukaku? Why does she want to meet us there? Paimon has a bad feeling about this...

## Talk 7

Yae Miko: Oh, but before I forget, you should eat this Kitsune Meal first.
Paimon: Whoa, it smells so good... Hmm... Oh, and also kind of like fried tofu, for some reason?

## Talk 8

Paimon: So, you need to pick the "best game," huh... Well, why don't we take a look around to get a feel for things? Then, we can go talk to Miko!

## Talk 9

Paimon: Okay, that should be enough teams! Time to report back to the Yashiro Commission!

## Talk 10

Paimon: The theme for the games is being announced today, right? Who knows what Miko's got up her sleeve... Let's go check it out!

## Talk 11

Traveler: Hmm, I think I'm good. I don't need to make a call right away.
Yae Miko: Ah, you don't want to judge an unfinished product? Well, that does make sense...
Yae Miko: There are fun things to do at some of the stalls nearby. You can check them out while the contestants work on their games.
Black Screen Text: You spend some time perusing the stalls and play-testing "Bunshin Phantasm," "Akitsu Harpastum," and "A Little Fox's Daydream."
Soon, night falls.

## Talk 12

Paimon: Alright — we checked out each of the games! Wanna give any of them another go? If not, let's head back and find Miko.

## Talk 13

Paimon: What was that for!? They attacked us out of nowhere!
Paimon: Something's not right about this... B—Be careful, Traveler!

## Talk 14

Kujou Sara: ...Though the festival has yet to begin, the game development process is sure to attract a crowd.
Kujou Sara: It is the Tenryou Commission's responsibility to maintain security and order throughout the entirety of the proceedings. So, remain vigilant. Understood?
Haruto: Yes, Ma'am!
Paimon: Hey, Sara!
Kujou Sara: Oh, it's you. It's been a while.
Paimon: You guys are here early! There's still three whole days until the festival starts...
Kujou Sara: Correction — there's a little over forty-eight hours. Besides, many patrons are already here to observe the development process. Festival security starts now.
Paimon: Wait, but what about the Statue of the, uh... Almighty... Narukami, uh... Ogo— Eh, you know the one. Won't you miss out on it again?
Traveler: Want us to buy one for you?
Kujou Sara: ...Heh, no need. All Statues of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder being sold at this event are an old model.
Kujou Sara: And as it turns out... I already own five of said model at home.
Paimon: Ah, okay... Well, that's definitely more than enough...
Kujou Sara: Yes, I only own five Statues of Her Excellency at any given time. That is my maximum.
Kujou Sara: Any more, and I'm afraid I would not be able to afford them the proper care.
Paimon: Oh, THAT'S the reason?
Kujou Sara: ...Personal matters aside, I heard you are the representative for this event. You should proceed to the stage and speak with the Lady Guuji.
Paimon: Oh, right... Looks like we're running out of time. Let's go, then! See you later, Sara.
Kujou Sara: Goodbye.
Inoue: ...Ma'am! We have a message from Commission headquarters. They need you to return as soon as possible!
Kujou Sara: Headquarters...? Now, of all times? Alright, keep watch in my absence. I won't be long.
Yae Miko: Ah, you're here! Now, we can get the ball rolling...
Traveler: Are we late?
Yae Miko: Right on time, I'd say. I was just about to announce the theme for the games.
Traveler: Uhh, what's that thing behind you...?
Yae Miko: Oh, this? Just a little something to spice things up.
Yae Miko: So... stay tuned!
Thoma: Hmm... We should be getting close, right?
Sayu: So sleepy... Can't wait any more...
Yumemizuki Mizuki: A theme decided by Miko and the Yashiro Commission... What's it gonna be...?
Yae Miko: One thing we all share... is our capacity to dream.
Yae Miko: Outlandish fantasies of the mind, nostalgic memories of the past, or telling reflections of our inner selves...
Yae Miko: In a similar sense, games also blur the lines between fantasy and reality. Just like our dreams, the bounds of possibility are as limitless as our imagination.
Yae Miko: ...With that in mind, your task is to create a game within the next forty-eight hours centered around the theme of "dreams." The genre and style are completely up to you...
Paimon: Okay... Nothing too crazy so far...
Yae Miko: And, to provide some additional motivation...
Yae Miko: The winning team will be awarded the Tanuki Game Award!
Yae Miko: As well as a generous sum of Mora... AND a sponsorship from Yae Publishing House to fully develop the game and promote it throughout all Inazuma!
"Kichiboushi": Mm!?
"Shousei": A—All Inazuma!?
"Gyoubu Koban": Thump thump... *squeal*!?
Yae Miko: In the interest of fairness, the evaluation committee will decide the winner based on attendee feedback as well as the opinion of our festival representative.
Yae Miko: Now, with that out of the way, let the game development begin! The forty-eight hour countdown... begins now.
Black Screen Text: Although Miko's sudden announcement leaves people reeling, the teams quickly get to work...
Yae Miko: Hm, looks like things are going well. We've just started, and it seems like all our teams have a plan.
Yae Miko: Plus, with the transformative powers of the bake-danuki, bringing those visions to fruition should be a lot easier.
Yae Miko: As the festival's most important judge and representative... You should go check on the progress, don't you think?
Traveler: I really didn't see that coming...
Yae Miko: It all comes down to fairness, as I said. I worked with the Yashiro Commission to come up with the theme, so the judging must go to someone else.
Yae Miko: No need to stress, though. It's all fun and games, is it not? Just choose the one you enjoy the most.
Yae Miko: Of course, if it's appearances you're worried about, you could always... Oh, I don't know... check in on the teams and ask about their ideas?
Traveler: What do you mean "appearances"?
Yae Miko: Hehe, and that proves that I picked the right person. Go on, then — I won't keep you.
Traveler: I plan to take this seriously, like I always do.
Traveler: Me as the main judge? Really?

## Talk 15

Thoma: Alright... Let's add another elemental reaction here...
Hitotsume Kozou (Hitotsume Kozou & Kappa): Boss Thoma is the best!
Kappa (Hitotsume Kozou & Kappa): Boss Thoma is the best!
Thoma: Heh, that's nice of you, but it's all thanks to Akitsu Yuugei that I came up with this in the first place, and that was all you...
Youko: Anything for Boss Thoma!
Paimon: Whoa... Guess this team really hit it off...
Thoma: #Oh, hi there, Traveler and Paimon.
Paimon: Looks like you're getting along great with Kozou and the others! Guess a "fixer" can work with just about anyone, huh...
Thoma: Haha, I have Itto to thank, actually. He introduced me to Kozou and the others after you left that day.
Thoma: We didn't get to see each other much during the Test of Courage, but they're a very friendly group of youkai...
Thoma: All I had to do was mention the Mikawa Flower Festival, and they agreed to help right away. They even showed up bright and early this morning.
Paimon: That makes sense! It was their dream to host the Mikawa Flower Festival.
Hitotsume Kozou: ...Yep! That's right!
Youko: Yeah, totally! We've been dreaming about it for a long time!
Paimon: So, what are you planning for the game? It kinda sounded like you're making a sequel to Akitsu Yuugei!
Thoma: Hmm... I suppose it's a spiritual sequel of sorts? It's a combination of Akitsu Yuugei and Mondstadt's Ludi Harpastum...I call it, "Akitsu Harpastum."
Thoma: It's pretty simple, actually. Just swing the racket to hit the balls back where they came from.
Paimon: Uhh, but what does that have to do with the theme?
Thoma: Haha... Good question. The Lady Guuji did say that reminiscing about "nostalgic memories" is a form of dreaming, right?
Thoma: For many years after leaving Mondstadt, the only place I could experience Ludi Harpastum was in my dreams...
Thoma: Once I was old enough to go back on my own, too much had changed... My age, my mindset... Whatever it was, the Ludi Harpastum of my childhood was gone.
Traveler: Thoma...
Thoma: So, I suppose you could say, "Akitsu Harpastum" is a childhood dream many years in the making.
Thoma: Oh, and in the play-test stage, I added a few characters that often appear in fairytales and dreamscapes.
Thoma: ...Hopefully, that reinforces the theme a bit more, haha. Wanna give it a try?
Traveler: Sure!
"Shousei": Haha! White Fur, Yellow Fur, get ready!
Traveler: Next time for sure.
Thoma: Haha, I almost forgot! You're an important figure in this event! Well, don't let us keep you. Come back any time!

## Talk 16

Traveler: I want to look around some more...
Yae Miko: Oh? Well, hurry back. Don't keep me waiting for too long!

## Talk 17

Black Screen Text: You share your play-test insights with Miko...
Yae Miko: Mmm, fascinating... Which game are you looking forward to the most?

## Talk 18

Paimon: Wow! Look at this! You've made so much progress already!
Yoimiya: Hehe, all credit to Kichiboushi! We just told him what we wanted, and he made the set in no time!
Sayu: He helped with the gameplay, too... All we had was a prototype, and now it's ready for play-testing already. His skills are amazing...
"Kichiboushi": Hm! Kichiboushi, amazing!
Traveler: Very amazing!
Paimon: So, um... how do we play? It doesn't seem super obvious...
Yoimiya: The board is infused with youkai power! All you need to do is place your hand on it to enter the "dreamscape"... At least, I think that's how it works, right, Kichiboushi?
"Kichiboushi": Orange Fur, very smart!
Paimon: So, you could say your game unifies human ingenuity with bake-danuki magic to create a scene that is completely illusory... Very creative!
"Kichiboushi": White Fur, suddenly use many big words...
Sayu: You sure sound official all of a sudden, Paimon... Are you trying to act like a real judge?
Traveler: Don't mind her.
Paimon: Hm... This new style of game development deserves a name! How about "Unreal"? Ooh! Or "Unity"?
Traveler: Could you tell us about your game?
Yoimiya: You betcha!
Paimon: ...Hey, a little acknowledgment would be nice!
Yoimiya: Although, Sayu's the better person to ask! "Bunshin Phantasm" is her brain-child, after all.
Traveler: "Bunshin Phantasm"?
Sayu: Yeah! It's based on a dream I had... In the dream, I learned to make bunshin, and I made them do all my work for me.
Sayu: With my clones around, there was no reason for that lady to come find me, so I could sleep as long as I wanted...
Paimon: So even when you're asleep, you dream of getting more sleep...
Sayu: It's just... I got so excited at the prospect that I actually woke myself up... *sigh* If only I could make bunshin in real life...
Traveler: I have a feeling...
Sayu: Well, then... Even if some get caught, the others could take a nap in the meantime, right?
Paimon: But if your clones do all the work, doesn't all that fatigue transfer back to you in the end?
Sayu: Oh, well, um... When you put it that way... I don't know anymore...
Yoimiya: All dreams are nonsensical and complicated in their own way. But that's what makes them interesting!
Yoimiya: Anyway, that's our game — "The Most Wonderful Bunshin Phantasm: Mujina Body Doubles to the Rescue!"
Paimon: What's a... mujina body double?
Sayu: That's a long story... Wanna just give it a try?
Traveler: Sure!
Sayu: Awesome! All you have to do is put your hand on the board and close your eyes...
Traveler: Next time for sure.
Yoimiya: Ah, right! You have other teams to check out! All good! Whenever you're ready to play, just touch the board, and you're good to go!
Traveler: Your clones might not want to work any more than you do...

## Talk 19

Paimon: Hey there, Mizuki, Kokomi, and Gyoubu Koban! How are things going over here?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Not bad — we've made a lot of progress. Miss Mizuki is very experienced, and Gyoubu Koban's abilities are simply astonishing.
"Gyoubu Koban": Piece of cake! *click click*
Paimon: Experienced, huh... That must put you at a huge advantage! Is it because you use games in your work?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: Hmm, I'm not sure it gives me an advantage, per se... The games I use are for clinical purposes, not entertainment.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: But if we want that award, we need something a lot more fun. So, my experience only goes so far.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: That reminds me... The Yashiro Commission chose "dreams" as the theme of the competition. Do you think that was targeted at us?
Paimon: Huh, using "dreams" to test a dream-eater... Yeah, it does sound like some kind of challenge...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: They knew we wanted to use this as an opportunity to advertise our game. But, now, it's a competition...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Which means, if we lose, our game will be completely overshadowed by the winner.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: And if we win, she gets a share of the profits as the primary investor... Miss "Fried Tofu With All the Frills" is on the top of her game.
Paimon: Wow... That's a lot of scheming...
"Gyoubu Koban": Mm? Screaming?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: On the other hand, if we do win first place, the prestige will help us get the word out, which should increase the popularity of the bathhouse on Watatsumi Island.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: As for Yae Publishing House's sponsorship... As long as we win the competition, we get to decide the terms.
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Winner takes all, huh... I suppose it works both ways. This definitely has the Lady Guuji written all over it.
Yumemizuki Mizuki: My guess... is that she's doing all this for the entertainment factor — for fun, basically.
"Gyoubu Koban": Mm! Fun, fun! Gyoubu Koban likes fun!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Heh, well said. I suppose that's the purpose of a game, after all. For now, let's focus on making our game the best it can be.
Paimon: Good idea! So, what kind of game are you gonna make?
Yumemizuki Mizuki: We're calling it, "A Little Fox's Daydream." Basically, you play as a fox navigating between sweet dreams and nightmares in search of delicious fried tofu.
Traveler: I think I might know who the "little fox" is supposed to be...
Paimon: Yeah, looks like that fox takes some inspiration from, uh... real life...
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Well, the design was Miss Mizuki's idea, but I'm completely on board. Sometimes, the only way to meet a challenge is with a challenge of your own.
Traveler: (Fighting fire with fire, huh...)
Yumemizuki Mizuki: That's the definition of fun, don't you think? So, wanna give it a try?
Traveler: Sure!
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Wonderful! Right this way...
Traveler: Next time for sure.
"Gyoubu Koban": Next time, next time! That's a promise!

## Talk 20

Traveler: Mizuki's "A Little Fox's Day—"
Yae Miko: Hmm?
Traveler: (You quickly cut yourself off upon sensing a sharp look from Miko.)
Yae Miko: What an interesting take on the theme... Tell me, did it come from Miss "Sole of the Deep" or my dear, old friend?
Traveler: You're not going to charge them for using your likeness, are you...?
Yae Miko: Heh, not a bad idea. But, I'm more interested in seeing how this plays out, which means... turning a blind eye, for now.

## Talk 21

Yae Miko: Well? Did you get a good look at all the games?

## Talk 22

Traveler: Sayu's "Bunshin Phantasm"...
Yae Miko: Bunshin, huh... I'm not surprised she's interested in learning that ninjutsu. I suppose I could find an opportunity to teach her...
Paimon: Wait, you know how to make bunshin!?
Yae Miko: Well, if it's conjuring a body double to sit at the shrine in my place, that's child's play. I'm sure plenty of youkai can do the same.
Yae Miko: Ah, but best not let Nana find out... Pretend I didn't say anything, okay?

## Talk 23

Traveler: Thoma's "Akitsu Harpastum"...
Yae Miko: Akitsu Harpastum, huh? I'm sure that will be a nostalgic experience for many people.
Yae Miko: Hmm, perhaps a Mondstadt spin on an Inazuman classic will be... Dare I say, a breath of fresh air...
Yae Miko: What do you say we drag Ei out here so she can join in on the fun?

## Talk 24

Takeshi: #Ah, welcome, honored Traveler. Guuji Yae told me about your visit. Please, come in.
Traveler: Well, that was a lot easier than last time...
Takeshi: Ahem... The Almighty Shogun is also inside. It's best not to keep her waiting.

## Talk 25

Traveler: Hmm, guess I should go back and check things out some more...
Yae Miko: That's the spirit! Give the games another look, and I'm sure one of them will speak to you. Go on, now.

## Talk 26

Yoimiya: Just think, all the kids in Inazuma might have a chance to play our game! Ah, I'm so excited! We have to win!
"Kichiboushi": Have to win!
Sayu: O—Or, we could take a more laid back approach? I mean, we shouldn't jeopardize our sleep or anything...
Yoimiya: Hm, you have a point... The most important thing is to have fun.
Sayu: Oh, and learning a ninjutsu to grow taller! *ahem* I mean, learning new ninjutsu in general, hehe...

## Talk 27

Traveler: I think so.
Yae Miko: Oh? And what are your thoughts? I'm all ears.

## Talk 28

Nightmare Fragments (???): ...
Traveler: (Is that it...?)
Nightmare Fragments (???): ...
Traveler: (...!)
Nightmare Fragments (???): ...Hyah!
Traveler: (So fast!)
Nightmare Fragments (???): ...
Traveler: (When did this dagger get here?)
Nightmare Fragments (???): ...Heh...
Traveler: (Hold on, I know this feeling... I've felt it several times before...!)
Nightmare Fragments (???): ...Hyah!
Traveler: (I'm in a dream!!!)
Paimon: #...Traveler! Hey! Are you alright!?
Traveler: ...What just happened?
Paimon: Well, you fought that strange person and made them disappear. But then, all of a sudden, you started backing up like you were super afraid of something...
Traveler: ...I'm fine now, don't worry.
Paimon: Phew... You nearly gave Paimon a heart attack...
Traveler: (I saw a dagger, but it was Tricolor Dango the whole time... So, it was all just a nightmare?)
Traveler: (Luckily, I heard the sound of thunder in the dream. Otherwise, it probably would have taken me a lot longer to break out of the nightmare...)
Paimon: Also, what was with that thunder just now? It came out of nowhere, and it's not even raining!
Traveler: Huh...?
Paimon: What's wrong?
Traveler: (So the thunder... wasn't part of the dream?)
Traveler: (Who was that person...?)
Ei: ...Has a "Nightmare" returned to Inazuma once again?
Asari: Hey, Komura! Time to go. The stalls are closed, so let's head home for the night!
Komura: ...
Asari: Hey! Did you hear me? No more gaming tonight. We can come back tomorrow!
Asari: ...Komura, Komura!
Komura: ...
Asari: Um... Komura?
Komura (???): What's with the yelling? I can hear you just fine. Let's go.
Asari: ...Huh?
Komura: ...What? You're not coming? Why are you giving me that look?
Asari: Komura, weren't you...
Asari: Over there... just now?

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Yumemizuki Mizuki: Oh, here's an idea... Let's make the final checkpoint of this stage a ramen stand.
"Gyoubu Koban": Hm? Ramen stand? Why?
Sangonomiya Kokomi: Let me guess... another callback to the real-life Lady Guuji?

### Additional Talk 2

Paimon: Well, we had to pick one, but honestly, all the ideas were pretty good...
Yae Miko: It's still early days, so there's no rush to make a decision. Plenty of novels at Yae Publishing House have opened on a high note, only to lose the plot halfway through.
Yae Miko: You can pick your favorite game once everyone's done with their work.

### Additional Talk 3

Kamisato Ayato: The Lady Guuji's decision to turn this into a competition certainly was... unexpected. But, I digress... What do you think of the award?
Traveler: It's very cute.
Kamisato Ayato: Is that so? Hehe, make sure to let Ayaka know you think so.
Traveler: It's alright...
Kamisato Ayato: Ah, well... It was a bit last minute...

### Additional Talk 4

Kamisato Ayaka: I can't believe I finished everything in time... That was close.
Traveler: Organizing a competition out of thin air...
Kamisato Ayaka: Yeah... It was a very last-minute change of plans. We had to get a bunch of supplies ready, like the Tanuki Game Award, which took a while.
Kamisato Ayaka: If only I had a bit more time, I'm sure I could have made it look better...
Traveler: That must have been a lot of work.
