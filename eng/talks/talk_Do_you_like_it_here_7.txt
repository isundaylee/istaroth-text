Traveler: Do you like it here?
Candace: It's quite different from Aaru Village, but I feel at ease here nonetheless.
Candace: I was so surprised the first time I came in. Such a small teapot, and yet so vast on the inside...
Candace: If I could store Aaru Village in a teapot...
Traveler: Wanna give it a shot?
Candace: I was simply musing. Even if that were possible, what I seek to protect is not an object named Aaru Village...
Candace: ...It is my homeland and the lives of everyone in it.
Candace: I apologize for making you listen to all this...
Candace: And, thank you for having me.
Traveler: That would definitely make things more convenient...
Candace: Hmm... If I could easily take everyone someplace else...
Candace: No, I suppose they wouldn't agree to leaving the desert in the first place.
