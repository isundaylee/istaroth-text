Karpillia: It's been pretty good these few days. I'd even call myself a bit in over my head!
Karpillia: Lots of guests from Mondstadt have made their way over recently, and they always come here to buy wine, so our sales of Mondstadt wines have also been on the up and up.

## Talk

Traveler: How's business been?
Karpillia: It's not bad. After all, liquor from Mondstadt is the best in Teyvat.
Karpillia: But the Sakoku Decree has really created some difficulty in the transportation of supplies. That's a headache...
Karpillia: I have no idea what will happen if we use local ingredients. Ugh...

## Talk

Traveler: Would your liquor be better than Dawn Winery's?
Karpillia: Well, I'm sure we'd...
Karpillia: Ah, never mind. As a drinker myself, I can't go against my conscience in this matter.
Karpillia: I have to admit that Dawn Winery's drinks are better. Even I prefer them.
Karpillia: Our store was actually forced to sell liquor here because we couldn't compete against Angel's Share.
Karpillia: But the businesses under Dawn Winery have practically monopolized the liquor industry in Mondstadt. I... don't really think that's a good thing.

## Talk

Traveler: Do you only sell liquor?
Karpillia: Um, too young to drink, are you? Well, we do sell other stuff too, like Mondstadt's famous Dandelion Wine...'s brewing ingredients!
Karpillia: That's a Mondstadt specialty. It's not supposed to be in the inventory list. But since you're also an outlander like me, I will make an exception and sell you those.

Traveler: How's business been?
Karpillia: It's not bad. After all, liquor from Mondstadt is the best in Teyvat.
Karpillia: The moment the Sakoku Decree ended, I had clients coming up to me to place some orders. And what do you know â€” Mondstadt's Dandelion Wine was number one on the list!
Karpillia: Now that the thunderstorm surrounding Inazuma has dispersed, cargo-carrying ships should be able to get here quickly. Once that happens, never mind our clientele... I'll be able to get a good drink myself.
Karpillia: *cough* I mean, after work, of course!

Karpillia: Huh... How can this be? Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Karpillia: Hehe, another one down. It's a hard game. It's only natural that you weren't able to overcome me.
