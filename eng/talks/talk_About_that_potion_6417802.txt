Traveler: About that potion...
Yasmin: Are you talking about that potion we sprinkled around the last time?
Yasmin: Hmm... Ladep and Pharez are still trying to make adjustments.
Yasmin: The effect was good indeed, but the "physiolocial emetic" that Ladep added really made other people quite uncomfortable.
Yasmin: And I don't know why, but this potion also attracts Fungi.
Yasmin: I hope Ladep can come up with an improved formula soon...
