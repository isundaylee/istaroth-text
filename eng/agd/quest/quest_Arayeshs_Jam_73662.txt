# Arayesh's Jam


## Talk 1

Traveler: About Jam...
Arayesh: Seems you are pretty confident about your Jam. Did you get the two jars of Jam ready?
Traveler: Here is the Jam you wanted.
Traveler: Not yet.
Arayesh: One jar won't last for more than a few days. I need at least two jars.

## Talk 2

Arayesh: Nice color you got with the Jam. You really are good at this. I'll order from you next time.
