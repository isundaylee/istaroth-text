# Akademiya Recommendation Letter

This letter, carefully crafted, and it is sealed in the name of "Ecologist Khedive Pursina."
You got this as a gift from Khedive. He claims that this is even more precious than gold, and can gain you the help of the House of Purbiruni.
Khedive himself believes monetary remuneration to be something of an insult... Hopefully, this doesn't prove to be a trend with people from Sumeru.
