Traveler: I... don't see anything.
Mécantre: Of course. The cannon is still in the design phase.
Mécantre: I am also looking into the materials we'll need to make that cannon. They need to be sufficiently hard and heat-resistant...
Mécantre: Or our cannon would get off one shot, then "boom," it'd be a goner.
Mécantre: I'm even considering placing the cannon in the shallows, or perhaps directly in water! That way, it should be easier to cool off, and we can transport cannonballs by water. Truly, nothing but benefits from doing so!
Mécantre: Of course, I'll have to solve the problem of forging the cannon itself first...
