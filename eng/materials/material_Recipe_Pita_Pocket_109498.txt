A handwritten Pita Pocket recipe, with detailed cooking tips in small letters. The writer's penmanship seems questionable. Some letters are shaky, perhaps due to the bad condition she was in. However, every word was written carefully.
If you have learned how to cook it, don't forget to enjoy this delicious food together with her the next time you visit Gandharva Ville.
