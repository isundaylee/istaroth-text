# The Gourmet Supremos: Where'd the Ingredients Go?


## Talk 1

Julie: Hmm... it should be around here.
Traveler: Julie? What brings you here?
Julie: Huh? Oh, Traveler, it's you! Hehe, never expected to run into you here...
Julie: I'm here to look for ingredients. Xudong is working on new dishes, and Parvaneh is giving him ideas.
Julie: Xudong told me that he wanted to make a sweet and soft dish for dessert based on Inazuma's Tricolor Dango. But it would take several special ingredients to do so.
Julie: Uncle Munehisa went into town to buy some Lavender Melons. I'm here to gather what they call Sakura Blooms.
Julie: Although I have gathered some, it's still not enough yet. I wanted to go search ahead, but it's crawling with monsters...
Julie: Traveler, please. Could you please help me bring three Sakura Blooms back?
Traveler: I've got it.
Julie: Thank you! I'll treat you to something great when you get back!
Traveler: These monsters shouldn't be a trouble for you, right?
Julie: Well, that would generally be the case...
Julie: But, hmm, how do I put this? If I really have to fight against those monsters, I'll definitely forget about the ingredient-gathering mission.
Julie: I've been like this ever since I was in Mondstadt. Whenever I was dealing with monsters, I would forget about everything else.
Julie: Only after I completely defeated the monsters would I remember that I still had an assignment that required my attention... That's how I failed so many assignments...
Traveler: You really hate monsters, don't you...
Julie: Hate them? No, not really... Actually, I find fighting them really fun...
Julie: Have you ever had that feeling, when you don't need to think about anything but defeating monsters? It's amazing.
Julie: Well, let's not dwell on that. So, please help me out with the Sakura Bloom-gathering mission, thanks!
Julie: I'll treat you to something great when you get back!

## Talk 2

Julie: Have you gathered all the Sakura Blooms?

## Talk 3

Julie: Alright, these will do. Thanks! If it wasn't for you, I would have had to charge in there and deal with those monsters myself.
Julie: If that had happened, I really don't know when I would have remembered that I was tasked with gathering Sakura Blooms again...
Julie: Anyway, thank you for your help. Please take these Chicken-Mushroom Skewers. Miss Lynn taught me how to make this classic adventurers' dish.
Julie: I'll bring these Sakura Blooms back to Xudong. I wonder what kind of goodies he'll come up with...
