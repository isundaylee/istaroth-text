## Talk

Freeman: ...I have no plans for you, my child. You're free to pursue what you like.

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me a bit about yourself...
Freeman: Me? I'm just a nobody, don't worry about me. Come, have a drink.
Freeman: Regardless of what brought you here, surely it's worth having a drink to celebrate our meeting on this ship?
Freeman: To celebrate being able to see the sky and the sea every day!

## Talk

Traveler: About Penny...
Freeman: Ah, young Penny! She must trust you quite a bit, if she's willing to introduce you to her animal friends.
Freeman: What're they called again?

## Talk

Traveler: About Autumn...
Freeman: The poor girl... Such a shame that you had to meet like that.
Freeman: In fact, she has a good heart. I hope she can be happy.

## Talk

Traveler: About Rouge...
Freeman: "To see truly wonderful things, you must look with your mind, not your eyes."
Freeman: Guess who told me that?
Freeman: Haha, he's a funny guy, and a good friend.

## Talk

Traveler: Until next time.
Freeman: Until next we meet, my child.
Freeman: Truth is always marching onward, and nothing can stop it! Cheers!

## Talk

Traveler: You can see it?
Freeman: To see truly wonderful things, you must look with your mind, not your eyes.
Freeman: ...Drunk talk, my child.
Freeman: Believe me, try looking from this angle, and you might just see things differently.

## Talk

Traveler: Don Quijano.
Freeman: Yep, that's a name that reeks of Rouge. Like a swordsman's.
Freeman: That Tiger-Striped Cat is really something! Ah, when those enemies chased us all the way to Poisson...
Freeman: Jumping out like some kind of great hero, scratching their faces to ribbons! Haha, such a brave, loyal cat.

## Talk

Traveler: Nana.
Freeman: Oh, yeah. I remember that's the name of Autumn's dog.
Freeman: This dog's too delicate. Grew up in the city, after all, and not used to life in the wild.
Freeman: I was shocked the first time I heard Autumn say she liked to pick out clothes and necklaces for the dog when she was young.
Freeman: So rich that even the dog wears necklaces.
