# "Tail of Watatsumi"

Ancient Stone Tablet: "This holy hall contains a divine blessing. Tread lightly and walk slowly, following the lights. Run not, rush never, make no hue or cry, and approach with piety in one's heart for our great Omikami's grace."
Paimon: Uh, so this means we need to take it easy... and respectfully?
Paimon: How are they gonna measure our respect, though?
