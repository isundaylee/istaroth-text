Read (Very Obvious Note): Now that I've added a lock on this labyrinth, that old man can't bother me about my writing anymore.
Read (Very Obvious Note): A labyrinth is a labyrinth, and a maze is a maze. The word itself is derived from "labrys," the "double-bladed axe" â€” so of course it should be symmetrical!
Read (Very Obvious Note): During Evernight, the two sides of this labyrinth become symmetrical, and so the way forward will become clear.
Read (Very Obvious Note): It's pretty orthodox, but there's a little avant-garde in there too! "The one who finally solves the mystery will create the labyrinth." What a romantic notion!
Read (Very Obvious Note): Such romanticism isn't something the old man, obsessed with rhetoric and rhyme as he is, would understand.
