Dharmakirti: Thanks for your assistance. This clinical trial is of great importance, so let me know once you're ready.
Traveler: I'm ready.
Traveler: I'm not quite ready yet.
Dharmakirti: No worries. We'll only start once you're good to go.
Dharmakirti: Once both you and the patient have awoken from the dream, we will continue to follow up with the patient over the long term. If the therapy produces good results, we should be able to detect long-lasting positive effects.
