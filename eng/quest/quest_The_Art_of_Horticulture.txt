# The Art of Horticulture


## Talk 1

Paimon: These are... seeds?
Madarame Hyakubei: These are Naku Weed seeds.
Traveler: You know about this plant?
Madarame Hyakubei: Well, I kind of know about it. I've seen this plant before and I've heard people talk about its wonders.
Madarame Hyakubei: I remember that... even in the absence of wind, this plant will tremble slightly to the sound of thunder...
Traveler: Does it look good when grown?
Madarame Hyakubei: If we're talking about appearance alone... I daresay it looks rather nice indeed.
Madarame Hyakubei: Would you like to try growing some Naku Weeds? But I don't believe there to be any suitable land hereabouts...
Traveler: I have my own plot of land.
Madarame Hyakubei: Oh, is that so? As expected of you... So, you have even been gifted land already?
Madarame Hyakubei: Pardon me for asking, but is your land...
Traveler: It's not in Inazuma.
Madarame Hyakubei: #Oh! I have also heard tell of your feats in Mondstadt and Liyue, {F#Madam}{M#Sir}.
Madarame Hyakubei: Indeed, it would be more surprising if you were not gifted land for such deeds!
Paimon: #Hey, {NICKNAME}, the land you're talking about is the Serenitea Pot that Granny gave us, right?
Paimon: Can you really grow things in there? Granny didn't say anything about it before...
Traveler: Let's go back and ask her.
Paimon: Okay then, let's go back and ask Granny.
Traveler: The adepti are very powerful after all.
Paimon: Is that so? But Granny really is very strong, so...
Paimon: Okay then, let's go back and ask Granny.
Traveler: It's actually in a teapot.
Madarame Hyakubei: #A tâ€”teapot? {F#Madam}{M#Sir}, please don't play such a joke on me.
Madarame Hyakubei: I have also heard tell of your feats in Mondstadt and Liyue.
Madarame Hyakubei: So I guess that your land is either in Liyue or in Mondstadt.
Madarame Hyakubei: #As expected of you, {F#Madam}{M#Sir}.

## Talk 2

Madame Ping: Hmm? Hello children, are you here to see me?
Traveler: About the Naku Weed seeds...
Madame Ping: Seeds... Ah, so you'd like to grow these seeds in the Serenitea Pot?
Madame Ping: I suppose that's no problem. The Serenitea Pot is your little realm, after all.
Madame Ping: It's just that you've only brought this bag of seeds today. Are you only planning to plant this one bag of seeds?
Paimon: Oh, that's right! We don't even know how to collect seeds...
Paimon: After we plant this bag of seeds, where do we go to find more...
Madame Ping: There, there, don't worry. I happen to have a little box here that I used many years ago.
Madame Ping: When I used to plant flowers, they were all kept in this little box. The flowers grown in the box can be preserved for a long time.
Madame Ping: Moreover, after putting the flowers in the box, it can produce several flower seeds... This makes sowing them very convenient indeed.
Madame Ping: Although this box is somewhat less useful now... but it still retains the power to "generate seeds."
Madame Ping: Hmm... I don't use it much now anyway... So, why don't I give it to you?
Madame Ping: This box should come in handy, whether you want to grow some flowers and plants, or some crops.
Traveler: Thank you, Granny!
Paimon: Thank you, Granny!
Madame Ping: Oh children, you don't have to be so polite. Go ahead and give it a try, but I must say that it's not an easy task to take care of flowers and plants, so you should be prepared.
Paimon: Granny is really powerful indeed... but before we try that box out, let's go back to our teapot and try to sow those seeds.
Paimon: Hmm, Paimon really hopes that they'll grow soon...
