# Talk Dialog

Yae Miko: There you are, little one. I knew I'd find you here.
Traveler: Oh, it's Miko.
Yae Miko: ...That's all you have to say? After all this time apart? How devastating.
Yae Miko: To think of all the times that I've sat down beneath the Sacred Sakura, praying for your wellbeing on your travels...
Yae Miko: But I think I understand. Another wise and beautiful soul has stolen your heart, haven't they? I'm sure you cast aside the omamori I gave you long ago.
Yae Miko: Alas, I am but another fleeting passerby on your journey... Oh, woe is me...
Traveler: I see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
Paimon: #You can always count on Miko to tease Traveler relentlessly.
Yae Miko: #Well, it's not my fault that he's the most appealing little Fortune Slip in the world. If I didn't indulge my curiosity by taking a peek inside, goodness knows how I'd sleep at night.
Yae Miko: Though I must say, another interesting Fortune Slip caught my attention recently. I believe you've heard of it too.
Yae Miko: This "Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness"... Something to do with a dog, apparently.
Yae Miko: My first thought was... I wonder if it could be the Boss of Komore Teahouse, Taroumaru.
Paimon: ...Taroumaru!? Yeah, he might actually have what it takes! Hmm, you think he was the one rescuing animals during the war?
Yae Miko: Sounds likely, doesn't it? Boss of a teahouse by day, changes outfit after work, then runs to a warzone to save lives... And what a fascinating character it would make for a light novel.
Yae Miko: But the question is... Do we think he was only saving animals?
Traveler: Are you saying you know something?
Yae Miko: I'm just speculating, little one. You know how much I like to let my imagination run wild.
Yae Miko: I look forward to opening up this Fortune Slip. Who knows what might be written inside?
Traveler: Nonsense, how could I ever forget the amazing Yae Miko!
