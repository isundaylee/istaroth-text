Traveler: How was that?
Xingxi: Ah, now that brings back memories! It reminds me of how when I was young, I would wake up very early to attend calligraphy classes at my teacher's place. It was so early that it was still dark outside, and it was terribly frightening.
Xingxi: Fortunately, I would pass by the house of an old granny, and I could often hear this song drifting out from her home. It would give me a sense of peace.
Xingxi: That dear old lady probably isn't with us anymore, but I've also grown, and I'm no longer as afraid of the dark, haha...
Xingxi: In any case, I've given it some serious consideration, and while I'd love to agree, it's going to be tough finding someone to watch a time-honored store like ours on such short notice.
Xingxi: So let me recommend someone else to you who might attend instead — Xigu Antiques's boss, Linlang.
Xingxi: She doesn't even open in the daytime, and you can either find her sleeping or wandering the streets — I reckon she'd have the free time to help.
Xingxi: Regardless, thank you so much for letting me hear that song again. I hope your musical venture goes well!
