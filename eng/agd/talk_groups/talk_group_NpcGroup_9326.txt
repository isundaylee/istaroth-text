## Talk

Albedo: It is rather pleasant here, far away from all the commotion. We needn't be in a hurry to leave.
Albedo: I would offer to paint your portrait since we have some time on our hands, but unfortunately I don't have my new palette on hand.
Albedo: Hmm... I suppose I could peruse one of the books here. Reading is a fine way to calm the mind.

Albedo: It is well worth exploring this domain thoroughly, though it will take some time. Approximately as long as it would take to read an entire alchemy book from cover to cover, in my estimation.
Albedo: Perhaps I could assess each threat that awaits us, quantify the total effort required in each case, and... Hmm? From the look on your face... You wish to continue the battle now, correct?
Albedo: Then let's go. Remember to make each move count, and be ready to change strategy at a moment's notice.

## Talk

Albedo: I was reading an alchemy paper recently, and was particularly interested in the section on Targeted Integration of Hidden Effects of Composite Alchemical Ingredients.
Albedo: Some details of the experiment weren't expounded on in full, although I was able to follow along and bridge most of the gaps. But I'm keen to learn more about what happens during the actual mixing stage. I'll have to take the time to recreate the entire experiment in full, then I can observe it for myself.
Albedo: Oh, you'd like to watch, too? Certainly. I'll let you know when I plan to conduct the experiment.
