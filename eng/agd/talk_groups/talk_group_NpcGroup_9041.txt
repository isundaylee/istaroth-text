## Talk

Mona: Huh? Looking for me at this hour of the day... This falls outside of my predictions.
Mona: Ahem... Is something the matter?

## Talk

Traveler: *Do you like it here?*
Mona: Of course! The conditions and facilities are first-class, and it's very comfortable here.
Mona: So comfortable that... I'm a bit worried that it might be hard to adjust once I leave.
Traveler: Then... shouldn't you leave before it's too late?
Mona: Wh—What? No! Are you serious?
Mona: Huh?
Mona: Why you...! Hmph... since you're letting me stay here for free, I'll let that pass...
Mona: Hmm... Let me think of a way to repay you somehow.
Mona: This way, we won't be indebted to each other.
Traveler: You can stay forever.
Mona: R—Really?
Mona: Being able to live in such a wonderful place without having to pay rent... Am I dreaming?
Traveler: There goes the Great Astrologist's pride...

## Talk

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Mona: Alright, I'm in good spirits. Is there anything you wish to know?
Traveler: I want to hear some of your knowledge!
Mona: Oh... how studious of you.
Mona: I am indisputably an erudite scholar, for my learning encompasses the stars above and earth below.
Mona: ...But it would consume a considerable amount of time to explain the tenets of astrology...
Mona: For now, some practical advice will do!
Traveler: Oh? Like what?
Mona: Hmm... For instance, ingredients approaching their expiration date can be used to create very cost-effective meals as long as you thoroughly cook them with the appropriate cooking methods.
Mona: Many stores have monthly sales. Find an opportune time to stock up on grains and dried foods. As staple foods, they will keep you feeling full for a long time.
Mona: Also... Processing your own meat products is much cheaper than buying them ready-made.
Traveler: Your knowledge is all about saving money...
Mona: Ah...! Huh!
Mona: How impolite of you to generalize it as such!
Mona: These techniques are all a crucial element of living a disciplined life. They are the result of refinement of the objective laws of the world.
Mona: S—So I'll be stricter with you. You need to be more disciplined if you are to understand this world's truths!
Traveler: Got it!
Mona: Heh, you will understand how useful these are once you try.
Mona: After you have mastered these, I will impart more of the secret wonders hidden deep within this world.
Traveler: You seem to have a lot of life experience...
Mona: Well, of course!

## Talk

Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Mona: Hmm, I want to reserve some of your spare time. Let's go on a vacation together.
Traveler: A... A vacation?
Mona: Maybe on an uninhabited island or in a quiet rainforest, just somewhere we can put work aside and relax for a bit.
Traveler: This doesn't sound like you...
Mona: Is that so...? Hey, you don't just think of me as some research-obsessed maniac with a one-track mind, do you?
Mona: Everything I do is to comprehend the truths of the world... Even a vacation is a way to meet this end.
Mona: I started preparing for this a long time ago.
Mona: Saving money can be difficult, so I specially prepared a savings jar. Every time I received a payment, I put aside some of it.
Mona: During this time, I also resisted buying hardcover copies of research manuscripts... Eventually, I had saved up enough.
Traveler: That must've been hard...
Mona: Hehe, it's alright, it was worth it!
Mona: Okay! I'll await your word.
Traveler: I can't use your money.
Mona: Huh? What do you mean by that?
Mona: Thanks for being considerate, but this is something I want to do, so it really is fine.
Traveler: Then I'll go set aside some time.
Traveler: Do you have funds for this...?
Mona: Hehe, I've already prepared them, of course.

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Mona.
Mona: Oh, good morning.
Mona: If you need anything, I'll make time for you. Call me if there is something you can't resolve.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Mona.
Mona: It's already time for you to turn in? If you ask me, there's never enough time in a day.
Mona: #Good night, Traveler. Yes, go replenish your strength.

## Talk

Mona: ...Quite the dignified study. May I use it as well?
Mona: In that case, I hope you don't mind if I stack all the star maps I bought over here.
Mona: Hmm... I still have those things I bought on sale. If I want to maximize my use of space, I'll need to plan this out more carefully.

## Talk

Mona: Let me quickly inspect the ingredients in the kitchen...
Mona: After all, you will most certainly need wisdom to turn limited ingredients into a dish that can keep you full for an entire day.
Mona: Oh yes, thank you for preparing these! If you're not averse, you're welcome to try some as well.
