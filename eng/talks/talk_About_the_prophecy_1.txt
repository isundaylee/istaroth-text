Traveler: About the prophecy...
Galathee: About that... I heard that when the prophecy occurred, the chaos was worst around the opera house. Romaritime Harbor was too far away, and all sorts of rumors were flying around.
Galathee: Some people said that the Hydro Archon did all she could to prevent the ultimate disaster, while others said it was Monsieur Neuvillette who resolved it...
Galathee: Well, seeing as Lady Furina has, indeed, left her post, I'm leaning more towards... the former statement?
