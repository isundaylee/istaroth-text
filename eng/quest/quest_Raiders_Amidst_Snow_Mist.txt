# Raiders Amidst Snow Mist


## Talk 1

Paimon: What is it doing here?
Paimon: Ah! It's running off, and there's something in its hands!

## Talk 2

Paimon: And that's our sketchbook â€” and it was on the head honcho, as expected!
Albedo: Ugh... There's been some damage...
Albedo: I need to head back to see if there's anything I can salvage. Let's meet at the alchemy stall in Mondstadt later, shall we?
Paimon: Wow, Albedo looked like he was in quite a hurry. Guess those who can't appreciate art shouldn't be able to handle it, huh!

## Talk 3

Paimon: Look, there's a camp over there!

## Talk 4

Paimon: Albedo, how's the sketchbook situation?
Albedo: It's alright. A few pages were destroyed, but most of it is intact.
Albedo: The temperature in the Snowy Mountain is subzero. It can reach extremely low temperatures, especially near that cavern.
Albedo: What makes matters worse is that the hilichurls have drooled all over the pages. To leave wet paper in such low temperatures, it's too dreadful to imagine...
Paimon: Frozen paper is so brittle. It doesn't take much for it to fall apart, huh?
Traveler: Fortunately, you knew how to piece it back together.
Paimon: No wonder you're an alchemist! Such an ingenious mind!
Paimon: If the sketchbook had been severely damaged, you'd be furious, wouldn't you?
Albedo: What leads you to believe that?
Paimon: You told us there's a lot of drawings and notes inside.
Albedo: I must admit, I bring this sketchbook everywhere I go.
Albedo: However, I wouldn't fly into a rage over such a thing.
Albedo: Had I not been able to salvage it, I would just draw everything again.
Paimon: Eh... How pragmatic of you...
Traveler: I don't think so.
Albedo: Is that so?
Traveler: After all, you've put a lot of effort into your drawings.
Paimon: That's right!
Traveler: Think of all the memories you've committed to paper.
Paimon: Yep yep!
Traveler: Such mementos shouldn't be easily abandoned.
Paimon: #Absolutely! All well said. You took the words out of Paimon's mouth, {NICKNAME}.
Albedo: Hmm... You're right. Redrawing everything would be a tedious endeavor.
Paimon: Especially since you're so talented, right?
Paimon: You've mastered so many skills and gathered so much knowledge that other people can only dream of!
Paimon: But such talented people sometimes forget about that. It's one of the downsides of being smart, isn't it?
Traveler: Albedo's also praised your smarts, Paimon.
Albedo: Without a doubt, Paimon is an interesting creature.
Traveler: Paimon forgets about the little things, too?
Paimon: Ahhhh! Don't put Paimon on the spot when it comes to wisdom!
Albedo: Changing the subject... Cyrus told me that the hilichurls from this mountain attack and rob adventurers.
Albedo: The place we visited should be one of their camps.
Traveler: The hilichurls in this area are strong.
Paimon: Yeah, the hilichurls here are way stronger than the ones at the bottom of the mountain.
Albedo: I can't disagree. I assume... this must be related to the dragon.
Albedo: The corruptive power emanating from Durin's remains is making the monsters stronger, which, in tandem with the frigid climate, depopulated some mountain areas.
Albedo: Can you take out the sword, Traveler?
Albedo: Each time you fought in the mountains, this sword was absorbing power and storing it within itself.
Albedo: Moreover, thanks to your purification, the corruptive power of the dragon's blood seems to be all gone now.
Albedo: It's a very interesting phenomenon.
Paimon: It's not the first time we've done something like that. We're experts!
Albedo: I always wondered what purification was capable of... I knew you were capable of doing it, but seeing it with my own eyes is a unique experience.
Traveler: A power-absorbing sword must be quite dangerous.
Albedo: Indeed, I can't say it's the safest of weapons.
Paimon: Lucky that it wasn't snatched away by those hilichurls, otherwise we'd be done for!
Traveler: Aren't Fatui a bigger threat?
Paimon: Hilichurls are a threat, too! What if that power could turn them into... super, no, ultra hilichurls!
Traveler: Ultra hilichurls!
Paimon: Ultra demon hilichurls!
Traveler: Ultra demon snowman hilichurls!
Paimon: "Snowman"? Now you've ruined the game...
Paimon: Anyway, about the sword... If it's so powerful, can't it absorb your energy as well, Albedo?
Albedo: ...
Albedo: Would you like to try it out?
Paimon: Yikes! Such a cold gaze!
Traveler: Paimon was just joking...
Albedo: It's fine. After all, I still hope you'll continue to use this sword.
Paimon: You still trust us? Even though this sword is so dangerous? Well that was unexpected.
Paimon: Albedo, you say one thing but do another... Paimon can never tell what's really on your mind!
Albedo: I have no idea what you're talking about...
Albedo: But if you want to know why I trust you... It might be because...
Albedo: The "unusual" ones like us share a certain degree of understanding.
Traveler: Unusual ones?
Albedo: Lonely individuals... Those who aren't like ordinary people. Just like... you and me.
Traveler: (...?)
Traveler: (Is he implying something?)
Traveler: Paimon didn't mean anything bad...
Traveler: Aren't Treasure Horders a bigger threat?
Traveler: I don't think Paimon has the same problem.
Traveler: If that happened to me, I'd get mad!

## Talk 7

Albedo: This is the monsters' camp. It seems that the birds have brought their plunder back to their nest.
Paimon: Let's get in there!
Albedo: No, our best option is to find a way to lure them out.

## Talk 8

Paimon: There's so many of them! Are they trying to surround us?
Paimon: These guys are pretty smart... Is this also the influence of Durin's body?
