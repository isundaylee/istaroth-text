## Talk

Traveler: Her story really is fantastic.
Dr. Edith: Isn't it? Her whole life was resistance. This must be the spirit of freedom that runs through Mondstadt.
Dr. Edith: If you want to understand more about her past, why not give this book a read?

## Talk

Traveler: Tell me about the huge tree.
Dr. Edith: This oak tree grew at the spot where Vennessa ascended to Celestia, in the same year she left. I daresay you won't find a bigger tree in all of Mondstadt!
Dr. Edith: I have come across so many stories and ballads about this tree in my time, far too many to count. Let's find somewhere to sit, I could talk non-stop about them for days...
Traveler: Maybe next time.
Dr. Edith: Okay, never mind. The offer will still be there when you want it though!
Traveler: What's Celestia?
Dr. Edith: Celestia is where all the great heroes and heroines of the mortal realm go at the end of their lives.
Dr. Edith: Those heroic enough to be accepted into Celestia become one of the gods and continue to keep watch over their people from on high.
Dr. Edith: Mere mortals will never know what Celestia looks like.
Dr. Edith: Even though there are many gods who roam the land in Teyvat, they are silent on the topic of Celestia.
Dr. Edith: Maybe only those heroes who have lived and died in the mortal realm earn the right to tell the story of Celestia.

## Talk

Dr. Edith: Hello traveler. Do you want me to tell you the tale of Vennessa?

## Talk

Traveler: Did you say Vennessa?
Dr. Edith: Yes, the gallant knight and the heroine who liberated Mondstadt. She grew up a slave, but rose up to overthrow the oppressive ruling aristocrats, securing freedom for all in Mondstadt.
Dr. Edith: Legend has it that this is where she ascended to Celestia and became the goddess who protects Mondstadt for eternity.
Dr. Edith: Different legends offer varying accounts of her life, but for the most part they converge right here, at this place, where her story ends.

## Talk

Traveler: You are...?
Dr. Edith: Ah, sorry! I forgot to introduce myself.
Dr. Edith: Just call me Edith. I'm a historian and folklore researcher, lately I've been looking for material for my new book.
Dr. Edith: You might have met the scholar with the strange hilichurl obsession? That's my older sister, Ella Musk.

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Dr. Edith: Farewell, and may Vennessa watch over you.
