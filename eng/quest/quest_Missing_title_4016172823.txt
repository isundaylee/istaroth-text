## Talk 1

Hanayama Kaoru: Hello, you're here. Do you see a lot of flowers in bloom? Aren't they pretty?
Traveler: Very pretty indeed.
Hanayama Kaoru: Hehe...that's for sure. I'm taking good care of them...
Hanayama Kaoru: By the way, can you do me a favor again? Now that the flowers are blooming so well, I was going to pick some flowers and make them into dried flowers, and send them along with letters to those who have yet to return to Tatarasuna.
Hanayama Kaoru: But... I don't know if it's because I had too little sleep, I just went out to pick a few flowers and I'm already so tired...
Hanayama Kaoru: Could you please help me pick some Sweet Flowers around here? Just three will do.
Traveler: Okay.
Hanayama Kaoru: I'll leave it up to you, then. I'm gonna take a breather...
Hanayama Kaoru: I just want the lovely fragrance of Sweet Flowers, other dried flowers will be included in the letter.
Hanayama Kaoru: I do believe that those who read this letter, surrounded by as pleasant a scent as it is, might at least be put in a better mood.
Hanayama Kaoru: I'm counting on you, then. I'll take a short break here... After you pick the flowers, please bring them to me.
Traveler: Sweet Flowers seem to be everywhere...
Traveler: How long have you been planting?
Hanayama Kaoru: It's not that long, it's just... I just sleep a little less.

## Talk 2

Hanayama Kaoru: Have you gathered the Sweet Flowers?

## Talk 3

Hanayama Kaoru: Thank you. These Sweet Flowers should be enough. I'll go make the dried flowers.
Hanayama Kaoru: Oh yes, I have a small present for you.
Hanayama Kaoru: Here, please take this dried flower. Although it is a bit withered, but it's a very valuable flower.
Traveler: Thank you.
Hanayama Kaoru: This is the first flower that bloomed in this sea of flowers. You helped me find the flower seeds, so I would like to give you this flower.
Hanayama Kaoru: Although it isn't anything very valuable, but still... thank you very much!
Traveler: I'm sure everyone will return.
Hanayama Kaoru: That's right! And that's why I need to plant more flowers so that when everyone comes back, they can see more flowers.
Traveler: Is there anything special about it?
Hanayama Kaoru: Of course there's something special about it! If there weren't, I wouldn't be giving it to you.

## Talk 4

Hanayama Kaoru: Hey, the flower blossoms today are as beautiful as always.
Traveler: Are you still tending to the flowers?
Hanayama Kaoru: Yea, I actually want to go find more types of flower seeds, so I can plant even more kinds of flowers.
Hanayama Kaoru: By the way, do you know someone named Xavier?
Hanayama Kaoru: What a weird person. He saw the flowers I planted and got really excited, then he ran up to me to ask if he could... what did he call it? I think it was something called "filming"?
Hanayama Kaoru: There was someone that looked like he was from the Shogun's Army with him. I got a little scared and asked what he wanted...
Hanayama Kaoru: He said that he wanted to have the person from the Shogun's Army stand in the flower field and swing his sword to make some kind of "swashbuckler flick."
Hanayama Kaoru: I refused his request in the end, because I didn't want the flowers to be trampled... Man, what a weird person...
Traveler: Is the flower-planting going well?
Hanayama Kaoru: It's going pretty well, but something feels to be missing. The flowers don't seem to be blossoming as fully as before. I'm not sure if it has something to do with the Mikage Furnace incident.
Hanayama Kaoru: *sigh* I guess the Mikage Furnace did have some sort of effect on the soil surrounding it after all...
Hanayama Kaoru: I've heard that there's someone named Vahid who sells specialty fertilizer in Ritou. It's said to be a local specialty from Sumeru.
Hanayama Kaoru: I'd grown quite interested in those fertilizers, so I got some people to ask around for me.
Hanayama Kaoru: But I've heard them say that the store owner... Vahid, I think his name is â€” whenever he introduces those fertilizers, all he does is repeat the same lines over and over. He never says anything about the details of how it works, either.
Hanayama Kaoru: That just doesn't seem... How should I say this? It just doesn't seem very reliable, you know?
Traveler: Please be careful.
Hanayama Kaoru: It's okay, there aren't any monsters nearby anyway.
Hanayama Kaoru: Even though there are no monsters about... I did see a strange person when I was out picking flowers.
Hanayama Kaoru: He just sat there staring into space, sword in hand, and he seemed to be mumbling about something...
Hanayama Kaoru: I was a little startled, so I just peeked from a distance before leaving.
Hanayama Kaoru: I'm not sure if he's still there, but he felt dangerous. Best I stay away from him...
Traveler: Goodbye.
Hanayama Kaoru: See you around. Remember to come and take a look at the flowers when you get a chance.
