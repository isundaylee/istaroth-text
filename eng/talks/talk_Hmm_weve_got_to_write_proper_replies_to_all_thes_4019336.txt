Aratani: Hmm, we've got to write proper replies to all these...
Traveler: What are these letters?
Aratani: Well, you see, the Yashiro Commission just sent over a set of congratulatory letters addressed to us specifically. We've got commemorative artwork from Mr. Calx, a handwritten letter from Mr. Zhenyu...
Aratani: And this one too: "Hey, Auntie Aratani! Hey, Lady Guuji! I hope Yae Publishing House's festival goes super great! Also, say hi to Big Sis Yoimiya for me, okay?"
Aratani: There was no marked sender, but I think I can just about guess which little miss might've had it delivered to us, heh...
