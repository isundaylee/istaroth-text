# Show Canceled


## Talk 1

Black Screen Text: Everyone gathers together. After hearing Nilou's thoughts...
Sheikh Zubayr: Trying to best the Akademiya in a debate is attempting the impossible.
Sheikh Zubayr: If you really want to try, I won't stop you. It's not like our situation can get any worse.
Rekhar: I don't think it's entirely hopeless. To Sharif, Nilou's approach will come off as naive, but that kind of frankness is exactly what they lack the most.
Rekhar: Things might turn out differently from what you expect.
Khasani: I am in favor of such a romantic feat. No playwright will turn down a compelling underdog story.
Kourosh: Sure, in fiction, but I'm not sure how well that will translate to reality...
Kourosh: I—I'm not saying that I don't support you, Nilou. If you need my help, just say the word!
Kourosh: Anything is better than just standing aside and watching the theater get demolished.
Najia: I'm also pitching in. Let's show the Akademiya that we have some fight in us!
Nilou: Thank you, everyone. I feel a lot less nervous with your support!
Inayah: Not to rain on your parade, but my father is a real hard guy to deal with.
Inayah: He is erudite, meticulous, demanding, and exceedingly familiar with rigorous logic. It'll be extremely difficult to beat him in a debate.
Inayah: You all already knew that, but you just didn't want to hurt Nilou's feelings.
Inayah: When all's said and done, aren't you hurting her just the same?
Sheikh Zubayr: That's enough, Inayah. Hehe...
Inayah: ...
Inayah: Sorry, I ruined the mood.
Inayah: I just can't force myself to expect a positive outcome. Nilou shouldn't have to push herself for the sake of an impossible goal.
Traveler: There is nothing in this world that is impossible.
Paimon: Yeah! It's way too early to give up.
Nilou: You're right, Inayah.
Nilou: We're up against the Akademiya. Everyone knows that they're very powerful. Being skeptical might actually be the more normal response.
Nilou: But I still want to try. I'm reluctant to just let Zubayr Theater go.
Nilou: And it's not just me — I think everyone else here feels the same way. If we're unhappy, we should speak up and let our voices be heard.
Nilou: Say what's on your mind, and do what you think should be done. If we fail after that, then at least we won't have any regrets.
Nilou: I mean... after all, the only thing we can control right now is our choice at this very moment.
Inayah: ...I understand what you're trying to say. I also have my own intense feelings of anger and regret.
Nilou: Then, could I trouble you to tell your father about our plan for a debate?
Nilou: You can still get in touch with your family, right?
Inayah: Yes, I can.
Nilou: Then, please help us pass on my request. I've never participated in a debate, and truth be told, I'm still not really confident in myself.
Nilou: But since we've decided on a debate, I'll do my best to prepare for it. I'll gather everyone's thoughts and let them be known to all during the debate.
Nilou: I by myself definitely don't have enough wisdom to beat your father, but what about the entire theater combined? Then we should have a chance, right?
Inayah: ...Right.
Sohrin: That's right, Miss Nilou!
Abhi: Beat the bad guy! Justice will prevail!
Sohrin: Make him eat dirt!
Nilou: Hee-hee, you two, we aren't getting into a fight.
Nilou: But thank you for your encouraging words. I'll do my best!
Traveler: Success comes from hard work.

## Talk 2

Najia: I've gained a whole new level of respect for you.
Najia: Inayah was right. It's true that I couldn't bear to bring down Nilou.
Najia: It wasn't out of pity or anything, though. I just felt like I didn't have the right to say anything.
Najia: After all, Nilou was the one who bravely stepped up and proposed to fight back. I didn't have that kind of courage or initiative.
Najia: I'd be a terrible person if I spoke badly of Nilou without doing anything to help.
Najia: She knows better than any of us how difficult this path will be.

## Talk 3

Kourosh: When the day comes, I'll get my friends and the theater's customers to come and support Nilou.
Kourosh: If anything goes wrong, I'll have them scream and shout and drown out whatever Sharif says.
Kourosh: ...Eh, I can't do that? *sigh* Fine, I'll think of something else...

## Talk 4

Sohrin: No one is allowed to bully Miss Nilou!
Abhi: Watch out, Mr. Bad Guy! Pow, bam!

## Talk 5

Farhad: You're here! Is the theater actually closing!?
Hushang: He's been worried sick for a while now. He wouldn't stop talking the whole way back.
Farhad: H—Hey, you too!
Jut: What exactly happened? Did someone come down from the Akademiya?
Nilou: Yes. He told us that we have to shut down the theater within thirty days, and that it's going to be demolished...
Farhad: What the heck!? That came with no warning!
Afshin: *sigh* They're messing with us again.
Farhad: Don't tell me you'll have to listen to him?
Hushang: C'mon, you know the answer to that.
Farhad: Yeah, it IS a direct order from the Akademiya...
Nilou: There's no need to worry, though. I'm preparing for a public debate with the Akademiya.
Nilou: If I win, we might be able to overturn things and change their minds.
Jut: Really? That's terrific. You have my full support, no doubt about that.
Afshin: Mine too! So, what was their excuse, anyway? They still not a fan of the theater's programs?
Nilou: Yeah, something like that...
Farhad: Good thing they have the power to make rash decisions about things they don't even understand, huh?
Hushang: Yeah, they need to touch more grass, not books.
Afshin: Exactly. They want to look down on us? Haha, we'll look down on them first!
Jut: Don't worry, everyone here has your back. The Akademiya's recklessness won't get them any praise.
Farhad: Right. They might think that some forms of knowledge are more valuable than others, but everyone can equally appreciate art.
Farhad: If they don't believe that, send 'em my way. I got them beat on this subject.
Hushang: Maybe you can prepare some questions on the details of dance performance to make things harder for them at the debate?
Nilou: Hmm... Sounds like a good idea. Maybe that's something I should do.
Farhad: Ignore him — he's joking. Just do things your way.
Farhad: No matter what, we will always support you.
Nilou: Thank you all so much! Your understanding and support make me feel a lot better.
Jut: There are always more solutions than problems. If you need help during the debate, just shout and the entire Grand Bazaar will be at your beck and call.
Afshin: Heh, gotta show them who has the people's support!

## Talk 6

Nilou: There are signs that someone had stayed here very recently...
Paimon: But we can't confirm if it was Inayah or not.
Paimon: Let's take a look around first!
Inayah: Aaah—!
Paimon: Did you hear that?
Traveler: I heard a voice.
Nilou: I heard it, too. Let's investigate.
Traveler: Is it Inayah?

## Talk 7

Rekhar: I didn't expect you all to challenge the Akademiya.
Rekhar: That reminded me of my younger years... Back then, I feared nothing and no one, and I was always charging into the most dangerous of places.
Rekhar: I can't do things like that anymore, but those were some of the best times of my life.
Nilou: Sorry... If the theater really ends up getting demolished, then you, Sohrin, and Abhi will all...
Rekhar: It's alright. There's no need to think such heavy thoughts. Even if the building gets demolished, its people will still all be here.
Rekhar: Have faith in the resilience of an adventurer. We can always figure something out.
Nilou: But won't you have regrets if things just come to an abrupt end? It'd be like when you were forced to stop adventuring...
Rekhar: Ah, so that's what you were worrying about.
Rekhar: Relax, I've had a lot of experience with regret. Things are painful at first, but as they say, time heals all wounds.
Rekhar: Look at us now: Sohrin and Abhi are happy, and Sohrin has also just passed his theater exam. He can start acting soon.
Rekhar: He was thrilled because he can soon perform on the same stage as you.
Rekhar: We wouldn't be here if it weren't for our past struggles. And would Sohrin have become a happier person? That's hard to say.
Paimon: Are you... trying to make us feel better?
Rekhar: Yes, but I truly do mean what I say. Being here at the theater has taught me an important lesson.
Rekhar: The most important thing about an experience is how you choose to interpret it.
Rekhar: I can choose to believe that my life ended with my husband's death, or I can choose to believe that it was a blessing in disguise for Sohrin and Abhi.
Rekhar: Similarly, even if this theater disappears, a new beginning might just be around the corner.
Rekhar: "Good" and "bad" are all human-made concepts. It all depends on how we choose to see things.
Nilou: You have a point...
Rekhar: Nilou, I know how important Zubayr Theater is to you.
Rekhar: But you don't have to be so nervous — we're all here with you. The theater won't go down so easily.
Nilou: Thank you, Ms. Rekhar.
Rekhar: No need to thank me. If anything, you inspired me with your bravery. You might have what it takes to become an excellent adventurer.
Traveler: She has it in the bag.
Nilou: Y—You're too kind...
Nilou: Alright, I gotta cheer up! I can't waste everyone's words of encouragement!
Nilou: Haaah, I feel a lot better.
Rekhar: Good. My children and I will be cheering you on at the debate.
Traveler: She's already a first-rate adventurer.

## Talk 8

Rekhar: Consider this as a trial by fire.
Rekhar: No matter the outcome, there will be treasure at its end.

## Talk 9

Sheikh Zubayr: ...Looks like this situation is really affecting her.

## Talk 10

Paimon: Paimon doesn't really wanna talk to him...
Khasani: So you've already developed some prejudices against me. And to think, I was just about to put forward a suggestion...
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon will listen to that!
Khasani: Although, I know not if you have a new answer to my previous question. Now seems like an appropriate time to revisit it.
Khasani: What do you think is the meaning of art?
Paimon: Ugh... This again?
Nilou: We probably do need to tackle this question if we want to prove the value of the arts.
Nilou: I don't know how to explain it, but all I know is that when my performance makes the audience happy, I also become very happy.
Nilou: Does that count as a meaning?
Paimon: You answered him so seriously! Careful, Nilou, this guy's ramblings never make any sense.
Khasani: No, no, Nilou's answer far surpasses yours, and it is close to my own.
Khasani: The meaning of art comes not from its creators, but from its audience.
Khasani: In other words, only art that can be appreciated by others will impart its essence and value upon the minds of its audience.
Khasani: This is something that the Akademiya can never understand.
Traveler: You seem to have many stories of your own.
Khasani: I once pursued the mastery of art, much like how a researcher would chase wisdom and knowledge.
Khasani: However, the more of a connoisseur I became, the less I felt I understood. I began to question what it truly meant for art to be "understood" at all.
Khasani: I knew that the most sophisticated works are often the least appreciated, and yet somehow, that provided me with little solace.
Khasani: I remained ever perplexed about this conundrum until I visited this theater, and watched one of Nilou's performances.
Paimon: It was that life-changing...?
Khasani: Everyone here had a joyous part in the overall experience. The actors upon the stage basked in the love of their audience, while those in the house immersed themselves in the wondrous ambiance.
Khasani: In all honesty, from a purely critical point of view, the performances here are exceedingly average.
Nilou: Hey, don't say something like that...
Khasani: But what bewildered me was how despite the performances' middling quality, they captivated their whole audience... they captivated even me.
Khasani: I realized then that I had walked the wrong road. The mastery of art was never what I truly wanted.
Khasani: I left the so-called frontiers of artistic research and came to this theater, for this is where I can finally find what I seek.
Khasani: Art will no longer be a castle in the sky. Whether it be inspiring or entertaining, art must be appreciated by others to confer value.
Khasani: If art cannot accomplish that, then it is meaningless.
Nilou: When you put it that way...
Nilou: Mr. Zubayr and I refused to follow the Akademiya's orders to change our shows for a similar reason.
Nilou: To put it simply, we were afraid that our shows would lose their meaning if people couldn't understand them...
Khasani: I once stood in the spotlight, but I relinquished fame and acclaim for the freedom I enjoy today.
Khasani: I care not for where my feet may take me next, but Nilou, you need to remember one thing.
Khasani: You already stand upon the finest stage there is, and that is a rare gift that should never be taken for granted.
Khasani: You cannot give it up, not even to the Akademiya.
Nilou: I understand. Thank you for your words of encouragement, Mr. Khasani.
Khasani: Dust the cobwebs away from the eyes of those scholars.

## Talk 11

Sheikh Zubayr: Just notify the customers when you have time. There's no rush.

## Talk 12

Nilou: Abhi, have you seen Miss Inayah?
Abhi: No, Miss Nilou! Miss Inayah isn't back yet.
Paimon: Wasn't she just passing on a message? Does she really need this much time?
Traveler: Could she have started arguing with her father again?
Nilou: ...
Nilou: Ahhhh... Oh no.
Nilou: #{NICKNAME}, Paimon! I think I've messed up big time...
Nilou: What if Inayah never planned to come back?
Paimon: What!?
Traveler: Calm down.
Nilou: It's just a gut feeling, but knowing her, she probably feels like she's completely responsible for what happened.
Nilou: She probably thinks that all of this happened because she was staying here.
Paimon: Oh right, as soon as her father showed up, she said that her father was targeting her. So she's felt like that this whole time...
Nilou: She has a long-standing conflict with her father. That's why she ran away from home.
Nilou: She doesn't think that we can win the debate, and she doesn't want to implicate us, so she thought leaving was the best thing to do...
Traveler: So, even after we decided to go for the debate...
Paimon: Mhm, and then she just quietly left afterward...
Traveler: She's too harsh on herself.
Nilou: Exactly. She's being too pessimistic. How will you know if you don't try?
Nilou: Anyway, first things first, we have to get her back!
Paimon: ...But where should we start? Sumeru is huge!
Nilou: I think I might know. Let's start by looking outside the city.
Nilou: Before I brought her to Zubayr Theater, she was staying at a remote campsite. She got a fever from drinking unclean water, so I carried her back.
Nilou: If she has nowhere else to go after leaving the theater, she might go back and strike out on her own again.
Paimon: Then let's go take a look!
Nilou: Yes, let's hurry.
Traveler: No one should bear all the blame.
Traveler: She still couldn't bring herself to support it.
Traveler: Please explain.

## Talk 13

Khasani: Although we can find a form of beauty in regret and disappointment, it makes no sense to just accept this world's tragedies.

## Talk 14

Nilou: Mr. Zubayr, we're trying to put together a list of arguments that might be useful. Any ideas?
Sheikh Zubayr: It won't be difficult to explain our position. They're in the wrong, and they know it!
Sheikh Zubayr: I have meticulously managed this theater's affairs for years, and I have abided by every procedure and obtained every permit.
Sheikh Zubayr: I did all of that to protect ourselves if something like this were to occur. I didn't expect them to disregard the rules altogether...
Traveler: This might have something to do with Inayah.
Sheikh Zubayr: Yes, I know. But anyone who's staying at the theater is one of us.
Sheikh Zubayr: If I can't even protect the members of the theater from outside pressure, then I have failed in my duty as a manager.
Sheikh Zubayr: In summary, you need sufficient confidence and strict adherence to the rules. At least for now, they don't have the authority to demolish the theater.
Sheikh Zubayr: As long as you double down on that point and force them to concede it, you'll gain an advantage.
Nilou: Alright, got it!
Sheikh Zubayr: *sigh* I've seen many situations like this before. The Akademiya sure likes to get its nose into everyone's business...
Sheikh Zubayr: While you prepare for the debate, I will also prepare the theater for the potential aftermath. It's best to prepare for the worst outcome.
Sheikh Zubayr: Once you're done chatting, do me a favor and tell our customers that we're canceling all of our shows.
Paimon: Do we really have to...?
Sheikh Zubayr: Right now, no one's in the right frame of mind to perform. I have to consider both our staff and our customers. This is the only way.
Sheikh Zubayr: ...Nilou, you are incredible.
Sheikh Zubayr: With your talent and youth, you had the least to lose out of all of us. And yet, you were still the first to take a stand.
Nilou: I've never thought about leaving your theater, Mr. Zubayr. I truly love this place, and I want to keep dancing here.
Nilou: I also want to keep dancing with everyone else.
Sheikh Zubayr: You're becoming more and more like her...
Sheikh Zubayr: Do your best. We'll do all that we can, and leave the rest to fate.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Inayah: Th—Thank you...
Inayah: There weren't so many big animals in this area before. They chased after me for a long time...
Inayah: Sorry, I'm causing trouble for you again...
Nilou: Why did you leave by yourself?
Nilou: You really don't think we have a chance at winning the debate?
Inayah: No, I just thought it would take too much effort.
Inayah: Everything happened because of me. If I'm gone, then the situation will resolve itself.
Traveler: But everyone else is trying so hard.
Paimon: Yeah! Everyone's working together towards a happier ending. No one should be singled out for blame.
Inayah: It's alright if it's me. As long as the theater won't get demolished...
Inayah: You guys are the kindest people I've ever met. You shouldn't suffer so much because of me.
Nilou: Listen to me, Inayah.
Nilou: Even if you were the reason that all of this happened, no one would blame you.
Nilou: Mr. Zubayr said that you're one of us, so that means we will protect you.
Nilou: No matter what happens, we'll stand as one.
Inayah: Nilou, there will always be a victim, whether it's me or the theater. You can't eat your cake and have it, too.
Inayah: You can't win a debate against the Akademiya, especially since your opponent will be my father.
Traveler: Why are you so sure of this?
Inayah: My father is an extremely demanding man.
Inayah: He's always wanted me to become an exceptional researcher and his academic successor.
Inayah: I tried my best to meet his expectations, and did everything I could.
Inayah: But he still wasn't satisfied... or rather, he had just never been satisfied with me.
Inayah: I'm no genius, but whenever he berated me, it was always as if he was asking me, "Why aren't you a genius?"
Inayah: Yeah, like I'd know...
Paimon: So that's why you ran away from home?
Inayah: At first, I thought that Father would slowly come to terms with reality, but he just wouldn't stop berating me.
Inayah: For one exam, I earned the third-highest score.
Inayah: I thought that all my hard work had finally paid off, that I could finally make Father feel some modicum of joy.
Inayah: I even used the embroidery skills I learned at school to make a commemorative gift for him.
Inayah: I thought... "Even this daughter can make her father happy sometimes, right?"
Nilou: I see... When we were embroidering your gift before, I didn't feel like you were new at it.
Inayah: Yeah, sorry for not bringing it up. These are not pleasant memories for me.
Inayah: I was tired of him yelling at me every day. All I wanted was to see him smile at me.
Inayah: But... He was more angry than ever before once I'd given him my embroidery and told him my score. He flung my present to the side.
Inayah: "You think you should be proud of third place? Reflect on why you weren't first!"
Inayah: I forgot how long I had cried for. I only remember my parents arguing. My mother also thought he went overboard.
Inayah: They argued for such a long time. My father eventually stormed out and slammed the door behind him. I didn't get a single sentence of apology, or any words of comfort...
Inayah: I've completely given up. We're destined to never understand each other.
Nilou: How horrible...
Inayah: I don't think you can beat him in a debate, because he doesn't even understand what kind of place a theater is.
Inayah: He can never understand the relationship performers have with their audience. His life is devoid of camaraderie or friendship.
Inayah: He just wants everything to happen according to his wishes, as if the world revolves around him.
Inayah: What we cherish — our little place in this world — means nothing to him...
Paimon: It sounds like your past has had a huge impact on you.
Nilou: I understand now, Inayah.
Nilou: But, when we were preparing for the debate, I heard something quite wise. Maybe it'll help you.

### Additional Talk 2

Inayah: Well, I'm off to meet with him. Please wait here for me.
Nilou: Okay. Looking forward to your good news.
Nilou: Phew, that should be everything. The only thing left to do now is to wait until the debate.
Nilou: I'm not sure why, but I'm getting nervous again.
Paimon: You were great, Nilou! Your words won over Inayah.
Paimon: Talk like that during the debate, and you'll get an easy win!
Nilou: Thanks for that, Paimon.
Nilou: But I still feel like it'll be an uphill battle. I need to be calmer, cooler, and more collected.
Traveler: We haven't broken any rules.
Nilou: Yeah. I'm acting as everyone's representative, so I'll need to act brave, even if I won't feel like it.
Traveler: There's still one problem left unsolved.
Nilou: Huh? What's left?
Traveler: The theater's existence...
Paimon: Huh? What a strange question...
Paimon: Isn't a theater just a theater? Why would it need to be anything else?
Nilou: Wait... You're not asking what the theater DOES, but what it IS.
Nilou: Lemme think... Um, how can I put this? Hmm...
Traveler: Is it only for art and performance?
Traveler: Lots of people are rooting for us.

### Additional Talk 3

Jut: As things stand, there actually isn't much to worry about.
Hushang: Everything will work itself out.

### Additional Talk 4

Nilou: Ms. Rekhar has gone through a lot in her life, but she told us that she's very happy to live at the theater now.
Nilou: Although she ran into misfortune, it led her down a new path in life. She sees that as a blessing.
Nilou: She told me that the most important thing about an experience is how you choose to interpret it.
Inayah: Interpret it...?
Nilou: I can sympathize with your unhappiness at home, but after you ran away, you ended up at the theater and became one of us.
Nilou: Those unhappy experiences allowed you to really cherish your bonds with everyone, and also gave you the opportunity to become friends with us.
Nilou: Don't let your past suffering keep you from the new life that you've worked so hard to find.
Inayah: Oh...
Paimon: Let the past stay in the past.
Traveler: You don't have to be so hard on yourself anymore.
Inayah: When I ran away from home, I swore that I would leave my family conflict behind...
Inayah: But you're right, all I'm doing now is falling right back into it...
Nilou: Maybe you'll disappoint him, but that doesn't matter. You have a new future waiting for you.
Nilou: Don't let go of the answer you've worked so hard to find.
Paimon: That's right! If we put our heads together, there's bound to be a way!
Inayah: You're right, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Inayah: I'm not trying to meet his expectations, so why should I give up because of him?
Inayah: I can't afford to lose anything more... We have to win.
Inayah: The debate will not only protect Zubayr Theater, but also allow me to settle things with Father.
Traveler: That's right.
Paimon: That's the spirit!
Inayah: Let's go. I'll tell my father about the debate.
Inayah: I know him very well. Even if he looks down on us, I know how to make him accept.
Nilou: Alright, let's go.
Traveler: This is your new beginning.

### Additional Talk 5

Nilou: Ah, got it!
Nilou: When we were trying to find a way to save the theater, we heard many stories not of the theater, but of the people whose lives have been touched by it.
Nilou: Zubayr Theater is our reason for coming together. It connects us all in unique ways.
Nilou: In other words, it's like a bond!
Paimon: A bond?
Nilou: The theater provides money for Ms. Rekhar and her children, inspiration for Mr. Khasani, and enjoyment for the people of the Great Bazaar.
Nilou: It also gives Inayah shelter from her family... It has brought us together after taking care of every single one of us.
Nilou: And its story won't end here. In the future, many more people will come to the theater and receive its blessing.
Nilou: And we'll all be there for them. Our warm, welcoming community will show them the same kindness we were shown in the past.
Nilou: Aside from the delivery of performances, isn't this another reason for Zubayr Theater's continued existence?
Paimon: Yeah, that makes sense! We definitely felt that warmth during the preparations for the event.
Paimon: But, Paimon doesn't see how this will help in the debate.
Traveler: Inayah said that her father doesn't care for interpersonal relationships.
Paimon: Oh, gotcha. No matter how strong an opponent is, they'll have to go on the defensive if pressed on a weak point!
Nilou: I feel like that's another prong in our attack. Thank you so much.
Paimon: Paimon also feels a lot more relieved. Let's show him what we got!
Inayah: Sorry for the wait. I'm back.
Inayah: Things went a lot more smoothly than I expected. It didn't take long for him to accept the debate, and is set for two days from now.
Inayah: ...Why are you all smiling so much? Did something good happen?
Paimon: We realized that your dad might not be as scary as we had thought.
Nilou: Hee-hee, we've just finished our prep. Rest easy, it will all turn out well!
Nilou: We have to win... No, we WILL win, Inayah.
Inayah: Hehe, fingers crossed!
Traveler: This may be his weak point.

### Additional Talk 6

Farhad: This just came out of nowhere. What'll happen next?
Hushang: Beats me. Everyone else must also be at a loss.

### Additional Talk 7

Noticeboard: Due to special circumstances, all theatrical performances have been cancelled and the resumption time has yet to be determined. Sorry about the inconvenience.

### Additional Talk 8

Noticeboard: Due to special circumstances, all theatrical performances have been cancelled and the resumption time has yet to be determined. Sorry about the inconvenience.
