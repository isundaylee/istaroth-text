## Talk

Traveler: Is there anything I should take note of nearby?

## Talk

Kagawa: If you asked me, I'd say that the scenery here in Watatsumi Island is the most notable thing.
Kagawa: Immersing yourself in nature as you train is a truly satisfying experience.

## Talk

Kagawa: Mm, yes... Getting closer to nature is also part of training.

## Talk

Traveler: Training?
Kagawa: That's right. I believe that people need to go out and train more while they're young. Only by absorbing the essence of both the sun and moon can one really train one's body and soul.
Kagawa: You see, the blooming of flowers mark the changing of the seasons, and the flow of this waterfall marks the flow of time.
Kagawa: We all live in nature, and we should appreciate its beauty rather than bury our heads in work all the time...
Kagawa: Wait, uh, I mean, you can only work at your best after you've trained yourself, am I right?

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Kagawa: Farewell. Remember to smell the flowers and take in the sights as you travel.

## Talk

Traveler: That's a pretty good point.
Kagawa: Exactly! I met a young samurai with a streak of red in his hair, and he said so too.
Kagawa: ...I'm not sure if this was the precise meaning of his words, but it's a sure bet that he's a nature-lover, just like me.
Kagawa: Not to mention that his abilities were way above mine, too! He could apparently tell what the weather would be just from the movement of the wind and grass. He must have reached the apex of training, I'm sure of it!
Kagawa: Ah, nature is so lovely. I, too, must train harder.

## Talk

Traveler: You're just lazing around, aren't you?
Kagawa: Oh, come on, read the room.
Kagawa: Life is short but the flowers are lovely. There's no need to rush.
Kagawa: Take these. I hope it all goes well with you.
