# Memory of Stone


## Talk 1

Paimon: You must be Aranakula!
Aranakula: Aaaah! A—A Nara discovered Aranakula! Wh—What should Aranakula do...
Paimon: Don't run away! Arapandu told us that you would be here!
Aranakula: O—Oh. S—Since Arapandu told you, you must be a good Nara.
Paimon: #Hmm? You're pretty trusting, aren't you, Aranakula? What if Traveler is a bad Nara and is using Arapandu's name to trick you?
Aranakula: Eh!? Th—The Golden Nara is deceiving Aranakula? The Golden Nara is a bad Nara?
Paimon: Um, that's not... Ugh, now Paimon feels bad...
Traveler: Don't listen to Paimon. I'm a good Nara.
Aranakula: #So the Golden Nara really is a good Nara! That's great! Thank Aramuhukunda! Although Nara Traveler is much taller than Aranakula, Aranakula's not afraid.
Aranakula: Paimon... Paimon is small, so Aranakula isn't afraid, either.
Paimon: Hey!
Traveler: I guess Paimon really is quite small...
Paimon: You'll be in trouble if you look down on Paimon! Hmph!
Paimon: Getting back to the point, we're here to fix the Varuna Contraption. There should be branches and leaves of the Varuna Contraption in this part of Vana, right?
Paimon: Arapandu asked us to come here and help you in case you run into any trouble.
Aranakula: Oh! There are many bad guys in Vana... There is a safe road, but we must be careful. There are also bad spores everywhere. Even Nara Varuna's... *sob*
Aranakula: #Nara Traveler is tall and big, and maybe as strong as Arabalika... Maybe Nara Traveler has a way...
Aranakula: #...Maybe Nara Traveler can help.
Paimon: #Well, we came here to help out in the first place. Right, Traveler?
Traveler: Leave it to us.
Aranakula: Aranakula has another request. Before fixing the Varuna Contraption... Please help find the Memory of Stone.
Traveler: ...Memory of Stone?
Aranakula: Vana never forgets. Aranara never forget. But Aranara leave behind memories that can be seen. Since the bad guys arrived, there have been bad seeds everywhere...
Paimon: Seems like Aranara always speak in riddles... Paimon guesses we'll understand when we see it.
Paimon: Either way, let's go there with Aranakula!
Aranakula: Good Nara! Good Paimon! Let's not alert the bad guys. Use the safe road.
Paimon: Eh? The bad guys? Do you mean the Fungi? In that case, there's nothing to worry about!
Paimon: #Hehe! Listen up, Aranakula, Nara Traveler is very strong!
Paimon: Not "very strong," but "very, VERY strong"!
Paimon: We've already defeated many Fungi together with Arapandu! Even Arapandu recognizes our strength!
Aranakula: #Aranakula gets it. Nara Traveler must be as powerful as Arabalika, but what about Paimon?
Paimon: Paimon? What about Paimon?
Aranakula: There was this one time when Aranakula was chased by a bad guy. Aranakula hid in the soil but got dug out...
Paimon: Eh?
Aranakula: Something dripped from the bad guy's mouth. It was wet and hot and smelled like rotten fruit...
Paimon: Whoa...
Aranakula: If Arabalika hadn't come in time, Aranakula would have...
Paimon: Oh no...
Aranakula: Arapandu nagged Aranakula for a long time. The sun set and rose back up. Even seeds in the garden sprouted.
Paimon: ...That's way too long!
Traveler: What does this have to do with Paimon?
Paimon: Oh right, Paimon doesn't get it either.
Aranakula: Aranakula is more powerful than Paimon, but was still almost eaten by a bad guy. P—Paimon is so small... It's too dangerous!
Paimon: #Th—That kinda makes sense... Wait! You're strong, Traveler. You'll protect Paimon, right?
Traveler: Of course.
Paimon: #Hehe, Paimon's Traveler's best friend after all!
Aranakula: But too many bad guys. Aranakula can't beat them... Hmm... Golden Nara is powerful, but...
Aranakula: Aranakula knows a safe road. We use the safe road, okay?
Paimon: Huh? Aranakula, are you especially scared of Fungi?
Aranakula: Ohhh...
Paimon: Hehe! Gotcha! But It's not nice to use Paimon as an excuse!
Paimon: #In that case, Traveler, let's take the safe road with Aranakula. We'll take care not to alert the Fungi.
Traveler: Oh, I'm quite good at doing that.
Paimon: Yeah, it does feel like we've done this so many times already...
Aranakula: Yes! Aranakula will take Nara on a safe road, then.
Traveler: You can always run away first.
Paimon: #Paimon won't run away and leave you behind, Traveler! Paimon won't... Paimon won't, right?
Traveler: Small Paimon, big energy.
Paimon: That's right! Paimon is very powerful!

## Talk 2

Paimon: Aranara are so small, so it isn't strange for them to be scared of Fungi that are several times their size.
Aranakula: Paimon is not afraid?
Paimon: Of course not!
Aranakula: *sob* Aranakula is surely stronger than Paimon, but not as brave. Aranakula always hides in a *safe place* when attacked by Fungi...

## Talk 3

Aranakula: Missing text (3046625178)

## Talk 4

Aranakula: #Nara Traveler, this is the Memory of Stone that Aranara have left for Nara Varuna.
Paimon: We're finally here... Paimon was so nervous on the way here for fear of being discovered by Fungi...
Traveler: Avoiding fights wasn't so bad.
Paimon: Paimon guesses so...
Paimon: Hmm... So this is the Memory of Stone? It looks like a stone monument made by Aranara...
Aranakula: #Nara Traveler...
Traveler: I'll clean up the bad seeds.
Paimon: #Aranakula, don't worry! Just leave it to Nara Traveler. It'll be as easy as pie!
Traveler: Think of it as the process of saving up some emergency rations in the forest...
Paimon: ?

## Talk 5

Aranakula: #Very bad seeds. They must all be removed... Nara Traveler...

## Talk 6

Aranakula: #Oh! Thank you, Nara Traveler!
Aranakula: Vana remembers everything that happened after Nara Varuna arrived. Big trees remember and seeds remember, but we don't know if Nara Varuna will understand...
Aranakula: That's why we left visible memories. This way, when Nara Varuna returns, Nara Varuna will know that Vana never forgets and Aranara never forget.
Paimon: Now, Paimon understands... So the Memory of Stone is a memorial plaque. Well, humans also erect memorial monuments, so that they don't forget things.
Traveler: Well, Nara are forgetful creatures.
Paimon: ...Compared to the forest, Nara are like small plants that will never become towering trees. They won't ever have tree rings that remember everything...
Aranakula: Aranara won't leave Vana. Aranara will always be with Vana. But Nara come and Nara go, just like Nara Varuna.
Aranakula: There are many Aranara, just like how there are many big trees in Vana. Many Aranara and many names, just like how there are many branches on a tree.
Aranakula: Golden Nara remembers many Aranara names and remembers that I am Aranakula. It is like picking up a floating leaf and knowing which tree it is from.
Paimon: #Nara Varuna must also have been a special Nara to the Aranara — that's why they erected a monument for her.
Paimon: Well, it's not quite the same, but we've seen statues with specific faces carved onto them before, haven't we?
Traveler: ...You mean the Statues of The Seven?
Paimon: #Yeah! And now that we've heard Nara Varuna's story, Traveler, don't you want to know what {F#he}{M#she} looks like?
Paimon: Aranara have music, so it's possible that they are also skilled in other areas! Maybe they can make lifelike statues too or something...
Traveler: I'd love to see them if they have any.
Paimon: Right? Hehe, Nara Varuna, a Golden Nara...
Paimon: Ooh, right! Guess we can go and heal the Varuna Contraption's branches and leaves now, right?
Aranakula: #Yes. Aranakula will bring Nara Traveler and Paimon there.
Traveler: Aranara art is very simple, so it's difficult to imagine...
Paimon: Hmm... Or you know, their art could just be too advanced for you...

## Talk 7

Paimon: So this is where it was hidden. Wow, we might not have found this place without Aranakula leading the way...
Paimon: But where are its leaves? Paimon doesn't see them.
Aranakula: The leaves... They are near this big tree, but...
Paimon: Hmm... The Fungi won't find their way in, so this place is safe. You can just wait for us here, Aranakula!
Paimon: Arapandu told us we just need to make the "leaves" on the three stones turn toward the "branch," right?
Aranakula: #Thank you, Nara Traveler and Paimon.

## Talk 8

Aranakula: Once the Varuna Contraption is fixed, the bad seeds will be no more, and many flowers will grow in the nurseries...

## Talk 9

Paimon: Aranakula, we're back! You'll need to handle the rest from here though.
Aranakula: #Thank you, Paimon, and thank you, Nara Traveler. Aranakula knows what to do.
Paimon: Oh! It looks like everything will be fine here too.
Traveler: I hope the forest will return to normal soon.
Aranakula: It will once the Varuna Contraption is fixed. But Marana... must be eliminated for Vana and Sarva.
Aranakula: Just as the monument made for Nara Varuna has been covered by bad seeds, Ashvattha's Concourses have also been affected by Marana.
Aranakula: There was a time before Nara Varuna came to Vanarana. Nara and Aranara made nurseries together then. But now...
Paimon: Now, only the children of Vimara Village can still see you. To adults, you only exist in stories... And the nurseries you talked about have also become deserted because of Marana...
Aranakula: Aranakula wants to fill the nurseries with flowers. Nara have forgotten Aranara, but it's fine. Nara will see the flowers.
Paimon: Aranakula...
Aranakula: #Nara Traveler, Paimon, thank you. Aranakula won't forget.
Aranakula: Aranakula will return to the "rest stop" now. Arapandu will be happy to know that the monument is now clean.
Aranakula: #Will Nara Traveler and Paimon return to the "rest stop" with Aranakula?
Traveler: Sure.
Aranakula: Traveling with Golden Nara feels so safe.
Traveler: I have something else to do.
Aranakula: #May Aramuhukunda watch over Nara Traveler and Paimon. Don't get eaten by bad guys.
