# Konda Cuisine

Slowly stewed local cuisine. Everyone in Konda Village knows how to make this dish. It originally had no name but would spread throughout Inazuma on account of its nutritious deliciousness. This eventually caused those from outside the village to give it its name â€” "Konda Cuisine."
