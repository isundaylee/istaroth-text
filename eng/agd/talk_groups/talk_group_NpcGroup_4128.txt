Behrouz: Sea monsters and Kairagi... Both troublesome issues.

## Talk

Traveler: And you are...
Behrouz: I'm the owner of a nearby merchant ship, and I mainly deal with import and export.
Behrouz: If you have a good source of excellent goods or trade routes, please do acquaint me. We can talk about share ratios.
Behrouz: It would be even better if I can have fine goods like gems and silks from Liyue, or Fontaine boats.

## Talk

Traveler: Troublesome issues?
Behrouz: You probably know that we cross-border merchants fear mishaps at sea the most.
Behrouz: I'm a seasoned ship owner, and very experienced in dealing with the issues, but these sea monsters still give me headaches.
Behrouz: And there are those vicious Kairagi too. It's no joke when they sink fortunes.
Behrouz: It's best to avoid things like these if possible. I'll need to plan my next sailing route now...

Traveler: See you.
Behrouz: See you. Be safe at sea.
