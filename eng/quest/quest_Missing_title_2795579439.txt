# Missing title (2795579439)


## Talk 1

Traveler: This is a Sumeru Rose that I picked.

## Talk 2

Sabbah: How I miss this sight... Here, your presents are ready too. Please, take them.
Sabbah: They're all seeds of plants that won't grow here. If you have a yard somewhere else, you can watch them mature there.
Sabbah: Ah, I just rambled for a long time... But it feels good.
Sabbah: Before you got here, I really didn't have many friends, and it could get pretty lonely.
Sabbah: Very few people in the village are into gardening.
Sabbah: ...Well, that's not entirely true. An old man living to the north of the village also plowed a plot to grow flowers.
Sabbah: I've visited him before. He's a slightly eccentric old man.
Sabbah: I saw him planting stones, but he insisted that they were flowers, and even kicked me out.
Sabbah: It must be lonely, living all by himself. I can understand that.
Sabbah: You helped me with my Sumeru Roses... Maybe you can help him with his plants too.
Sabbah: You and Paimon should visit him if you get a chance.
