Traveler: About Magic...
Paimon: Lyney's magic shows are amazing! Paimon never would've guessed how he did it before he revealed his secret.
Traveler: Hold on... I just thought of a magic trick!
Paimon: Huh? You know how to do magic too?
Traveler: Yep. I can make a big magician's hat float in the air...
Paimon: Whoa! Really? How do you do that?
Traveler: Hehe, simple! I put Paimon inside the hat.
Paimon: What? Why would Paimon be... Ohhh, so Paimon's the one making it float!
Paimon: Hehe, in that case, Paimon has an idea for an even better magic trick!
Traveler: Huh? What is it?
Paimon: Behold, the bottomless hat! No matter how many plates of delicious food you throw into it, it'll never get full!
Traveler: Uh... Wait, so where would the plates go?
Paimon: Oh, good point! Umm... Oh, the hat spits the empty plates back out! Tada! Whaddya think?
Traveler: And even make it move at my command.
