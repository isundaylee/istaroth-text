# Missing title (3100824751)

Ann: #Knight {NICKNAME}...
Traveler: About the current situation...
Ann: I believe I've recalled certain... some very vague feelings. I am not sure they can even be called memories...
Ann: Though I don't know whether humans keep their memories in their heads or in their heart...
Ann: But Oceanids seem to have neither a brain nor heart, just water...
Ann: If only I could be like that silly dog, just sit there and mumble stuff like "Drive Defragmenting" to recall everything...
Traveler: I want to know more about you, Ann...
Ann: I don't know what else I can tell you...
Ann: I'm the part of Mary-Ann that was imagined into being here, but... but she rejected me, and the others as well... I mean, other existences...
Ann: The Princess Lyris I want to rescue does not exist. "Mary-Ann" is also not Mary-Ann, and isn't that silly dog's owner.
Ann: I don't know why, but when I see that silly dog, something just swells inside of me... It feels like bubbles! But they burst whenever I get close to remembering...
Ann: Caterpillar seems to know something, but he won't say much if he's not 100% sure.
Ann: We came to the place with Narzissenkreuz in its name, yet nothing was resolved...
Traveler: I want to know more about Princess Lyris...
Ann: Princess Lyris is kind and courageous. That's why she endangered herself... in order to protect her friends.
Ann: Before, all I thought was that I must have been a friend of hers and she protected me, so now that's she's in trouble, I have to save her.
Ann: Even though she might not want me to do that... because she is too nice, and would rather suffer than let her friends be in danger.
Ann: But if I don't save her, how could I be worthy of being her friend or deserve her protection?
Ann: "Memories"... They're hazy, like whirlpools in water. Emotions and desires, on the other hand, feel so real, despite me realizing she's just a character in a story now...
Traveler: It's all right. Just go to bed.
Ann: #Okay. Good night, Knight {NICKNAME}.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Seymour: #...Calculation process halted. What are your instructions, {M#Mr.}{F#Ms.} {NICKNAME}?
Traveler: About the current situation...
Seymour: Through communication with Ann the Oceanid and the former Narzissenkreuz Ordo member Caterpillar, some promising information has been obtained.
Seymour: I am Prototype 4ACV07, designed by Guillotin to accompany and protect my master, Ms. Mary-Ann.
Seymour: Unfortunately, no additional information on Ms. Mary-Ann is currently available.
Seymour: Moreover, Ann the Oceanid was able to provide very little information.
Seymour: The remaining member of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo Caterpillar did not provide complete information.
Seymour: More time is required for analysis...
Traveler: I want to know more about you, Seymour...
Seymour: I am Prototype 4ACV07, designed by Guillotin to accompany and protect my master, Ms. Mary-Ann.
Seymour: I am equipped with the most advanced memory storage unit, logic unit, optics, and various functional modules from the Fontaine Institute of Natural Philosophy.
Seymour: This allows me to keep a log of Ms. Mary-Ann's daily life and also act as an agent's assistant.
Seymour: My present top priority is: To locate Ms. Mary-Ann and ensure her safety.
Traveler: I want to know more about Mary-Ann...
Seymour: The purpose of my design and creation is to serve and protect my owner, Ms. Mary-Ann.
Seymour: My present top priority is: To locate Ms. Mary-Ann and ensure her safety.
Seymour: Ann the Oceanid exhibited certain behaviors identical to the past behaviors of Ms. Mary-Ann.
Seymour: But the factors comprising them... (loud mechanical noises)... (loud mechanical noises)...
Seymour: Note: Regular record space collation can decrease the frequency of such issues effectively.
Traveler: Oh, nothing. Bye.
Seymour: #Affirmative. Have a nice day, {M#Mr.}{F#Ms.} {NICKNAME}.

### Additional Talk 2

Caterpillar: Anything else you want to talk about?
Traveler: About the current situation...
Caterpillar: It's nice that this place is so lively again after several centuries.
Caterpillar: ...Just joking. I think there's a purpose to all this... I mean, to us gathering like this. It's boring and foolish to treat it as simple, sheer coincidence.
Caterpillar: Our encounter has to be an omen of a kind of beginning, akin to a repressed seed struggling before fully germinating.
Caterpillar: But on the other hand, before the actual apocalypse arrives, just who would try to find meaning in absurdity and be convinced that those signs herald that inevitable solemn moment?
Caterpillar: Other than Narzissenkreuz, whom I used to call Master. Regardless, he deserved to be called a Grandmaster.
Caterpillar: Just like our paths crossed here under the Doomsday Clock, if we follow along the woven path together, maybe we can...
Caterpillar: ...
Caterpillar: ...I should save the rest of that thought for the end of the journey.
Traveler: I want to know more about you, Caterpillar...
Caterpillar: What else is there to say about myself?
Caterpillar: I often feel mutually exclusive elements in the nature of my existence. Individually, they are pure, but also alien to each other.
Caterpillar: Therefore, when they interact, they mix with the other and become impure. Can you understand that?
Caterpillar: My own identity is not consistent... Sometimes I am a Bloomguard, other times a dragon. My identity is a lie built out of the stories of others...
Caterpillar: But I believe a definitive answer exists, a singular correct answer. As the hands on the clock move again, I'm ready to take that step.
Traveler: I want to know more about Lanoire...
Caterpillar: Our time together was very short, but I never thought I'd be so committed to playing the role of a protector for her.
Caterpillar: It was indeed a very novel experience. Perhaps I was attracted by her purity, because that's a quality I will never possess.
Caterpillar: Yet the Fortress of Meropide is what kept her innocent... Somewhere she shouldn't have been in the first place.
Caterpillar: To give her an opportunity to choose, the right to choose must be first stripped from her.
Caterpillar: But whenever I think of how now, the mundane world has finally entered her heart...
Caterpillar: ...
Traveler: We'll talk about this later.
Caterpillar: I'll stay here until it's time for us to set out.
