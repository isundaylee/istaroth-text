# Subterranean Ruins


## Talk 1

Black Screen Text: You slowly fall asleep to the sound of Paimon's snoring...

## Talk 2

Traveler: (Where am I? Is this... the Night Kingdom?)
Traveler: (How did I get here? I was just... Argh...)
Traveler: (I feel dizzy, like I can't think straight. Let me try to take a look around...)

## Talk 3

Traveler: (When I passed through the wall of light, it felt like my whole body was frozen.)
Traveler: (I guess the Lord of the Night's protection can't reach this place. The cold and darkness are suffocating, and all I hear are cries of exhaustion and pain.)
Traveler: (How long have these souls existed in torment? How much longer before it ends...?)
Traveler: (Huh? There's someone here...)
"The Captain": Though our homeland has become a distant memory, the flames of war continue to rage. We have long shed the last of our blood...
"The Captain": Stay strong, my soldiers...
Traveler: (What is The Captain doing here? And what is he saying...?)
"The Captain": One day, I will deliver you to the place I promised.

## Talk 4

Paimon: #Morning, Traveler! Did you have a nightmare last night?
Paimon: Paimon could hear you tossing and turning in your sleep. Maybe you're just nervous for the final battle?
Traveler: (So, it was a dream? I can barely remember it.)
Traveler: (Everything that happened seems so hazy. Trying to remember is giving me a headache...)
Paimon: #Just shake it off, Traveler! We're supposed to meet with Mavuika today!
