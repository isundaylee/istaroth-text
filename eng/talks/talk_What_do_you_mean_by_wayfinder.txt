Traveler: What do you mean by "wayfinder"...?
Kahuna: Oh, I mean a whole bunch of People of the Springs who love exploring Natlan.
Kahuna: If you think about it carefully, their job scope is similar to that of adventurers, they just call themselves something else.
Kahuna: As you know, our lands are rife with high-temperature regions, and people of our tribe can explore all sorts of places with the aid of our Koholasaurs.
Kahuna: As such, many from other tribes and tourists alike will hire wayfinders for convenience, whether as navigators or scouts.
