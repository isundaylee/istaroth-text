Estelle: You want to know about ore-producing areas nearby? Well, there are indeed some Condessence Crystals around, but I can't move my machine over there to help you extract them. You're on your own, I fear...
Estelle: That's no problem, you say? Okay, then. Allow me to mark the spot on your map. And remember, safety first while excavating!
