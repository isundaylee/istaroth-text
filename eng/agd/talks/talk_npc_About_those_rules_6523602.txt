Traveler: About those rules...
Grainville: First, bringing items not related to production into the production zone is forbidden, including Genius Invokation TCG cards, books, etc. Beast Traps too, though just who would even think of setting one up here...
Grainville: Second, complete production work in a timely manner and ensure all products meet quality standards. Be willing to accept technical assistance when necessary. This bit should be pretty obvious, yeah?
Grainville: Finally, take good care of equipment! Stealing any production materials or modifying the clockwork meka is strictly forbidden. Wouldn't want to spend time in Solitary staring at the wall and twiddling your thumbs, no would you?
