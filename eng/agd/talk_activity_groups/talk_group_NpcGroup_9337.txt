Kujou Sara: To me, battle signifies a duty and responsibility that cannot be shirked.
Kujou Sara: But I do cherish the times when there is a brief lull in the fighting. I use this time to hone my skills through training.
Kujou Sara: Right now, I intend to engage in a kind of training known as "rest and recovery," which consists of five sets of deep breaths.

Kujou Sara: As a general, I must never break under pressure. I must remain calm and composed at all times, and respond diligently to the changing situation on the battlefield, adjusting my strategy and cautiously redeploying my troops as necessary.
Kujou Sara: As long as everyone works together towards victory, victory is possible even in the most difficult of battles.
Kujou Sara: Today, the task of planning the operation falls to you. You may use my experience as a reference if you find it useful.

Kujou Sara: I wonder if the Almighty Shogun would enjoy the books here...
Kujou Sara: It's common courtesy to return from one's travels bearing gifts for one's acquaintances, so I'm sure the Almighty Shogun will not refuse my offering. In which case, perhaps I shall purchase five books in my own name to take back with me...
Kujou Sara: But of course, all this depends on whether the management of this place is amenable to my request to buy the books.
