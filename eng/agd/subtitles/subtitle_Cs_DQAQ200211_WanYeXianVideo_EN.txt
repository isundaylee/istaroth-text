He was once a good friend of mine
One day, he asked me about a sword art of which he had heard
The Musou no Hitotachi
I told him
It can only be witnessed when "divine punishment" is administered
It is the pinnacle of the Raiden Shogun's skill
A symbol of ultimate power
But he replied: "There must be one who can withstand it"
"There will always be those who dare to brave the lightning's glow"
Then, the Vision Hunt Decree arrived
Peoples' aspirations were stripped away
As the Raiden Shogun began to construct her ideal of "eternity"
While I was fleeing from place to place
I heard that my friend had challenged the Vision Hunters
To a duel before the throne
A solemn yet brutal challenge
The defeated face divine punishment, while the victors gain a second chance
Perhaps he thought he of all people should make a stand
Coming face to face with the Musou No Hitotachi
Was all that he truly desired, after all
When I arrived at Tenshukaku
The duel was over
I heard his sentence of divine punishment
His severed blade hitting the ground
Perhaps that was the glory he had yearned to witness
In his last moments
What expression was on his face?
Before I knew it
I had stepped forward and snatched the dying Vision
And was running from the scene
All I knew was that I mustn't let his hope which burned so brightly
Become buried among the ice-cold statue of a god
