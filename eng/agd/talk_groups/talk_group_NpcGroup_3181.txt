Traveler: Lady... Neko?
Taisuke: Of course! She's the provisional head priestess of this Asase Shrine, you know? She's a very distinguished cat indeed!
Taisuke: Going to see her empty-handed would just be rude — so I must prepare some sort of greeting gift.
Taisuke: I originally wanted to go to Narukami Island to prepare some gifts, but if we went back there, I'm sure that Miss Etsuko would drag me off to the Guild...
Taisuke: If that happened, I might never get another chance to come to Seirai Island...

Traveler: You could just make some yourself.
Taisuke: Exactly! That's exactly what I was thinking too! Seirai Island is dotted by a great number of shallows, so I decided to make some tools and go over there later to catch a few fish!
Taisuke: Once that's done, we can make some grilled fish, some smoked fish, some dried fish, some fish soup...
Taisuke: Oh, I do hope Lady Neko will like them!
