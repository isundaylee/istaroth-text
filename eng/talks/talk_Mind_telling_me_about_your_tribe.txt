Traveler: Mind telling me about your tribe?
Avilix: The Children of Echoes? Ah, this is the tribe right here.
Avilix: Pretty cozy, right? This is the home where we grew up. We've always been surrounded by music, dance, and incredibly chubby Tepetlisaurs.
Avilix: The only problem is that we've dug too deep into the mountains, so sometimes, it's hard to get a good amount of sun. But that's fine â€” the people here are rowdy enough that you'll never feel lonely.
