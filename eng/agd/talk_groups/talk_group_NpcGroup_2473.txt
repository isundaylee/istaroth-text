Lixing: Adjustments can still be made to the new delivery plan's transfer point...
Lixing: Oh, forgive me. Can I help you?

Traveler: What are you muttering to yourself about?
Lixing: It's complicated... I'll try to give you a summary.
Lixing: I work for the Communications Office, and my job is to evaluate and optimize transport plans for designated routes.
Lixing: Even if the Communications Office is well-staffed, covering all the transportation work throughout Liyue is quite impossible, which is why we outsource some work to the local Secure Transport Agencies.
Lixing: But given how their equipment varies, controlling the transportation times with any precision is a nightmare.
Lixing: This, in turn, poses a considerable challenge to our planning capabilities...
Lixing: A situation like this will be difficult to turn around in the short term. After all, standardizing their equipment requires a huge investment.
Lixing: Local Secure Transport Agencies are usually unable to afford such large sums. They still have to live and eat, right? So, it's up to us to eke a solution out somehow...

Traveler: Transportation proposal?
Lixing: Take this for example. Agency A must transport goods from Lumidouce Harbor to Liyue Harbor.
Lixing: During this process, they transport the goods to the docks between Qiaoying Village and Qingce Village...
Lixing: They can choose to transport the goods and carts to the opposite shore and continue on land.
Lixing: Now, you may have realized that continuing south along the waterway before getting on land at Wangshu Inn is the superior option!
Lixing: But things aren't that simple. The ship traveling down the waterway may not belong to Agency A. It may belong to the Communications Office, Agency B, or independent shipowner C.
Lixing: In moments like these, specialized personnel are required to coordinate the transfers between different individuals or organizations. That is the transportation plan I mentioned.

Traveler: Good luck, and farewell!
Lixing: Thâ€”Thanks for the words of encouragement! I'll have to give it more thought...

## Talk

Traveler: Sounds like a lot of trouble...
Lixing: Oh, it can't be helped. Getting various groups to cooperate has always been complicated.
Lixing: What I mentioned earlier was just the basics. Accounting for the type and time sensitivity of each shipment makes this a dizzying task and then some.
Lixing: Let's say the grain output in Chenyu Vale isn't looking good and a large import is required. This would occupy a large part of the transportation capacity available from Liyue's heartlands to Chenyu Vale.
Lixing: But the main export commodity here is tea leaves, and its weight characteristics, packing methods, and storage conditions greatly differ from grains.
Lixing: Fortunately, my seniors have resolved that issue a long while back. If I had to optimize the transportation of grains and tea leaves...
Lixing: My hair would turn completely white within the week!
