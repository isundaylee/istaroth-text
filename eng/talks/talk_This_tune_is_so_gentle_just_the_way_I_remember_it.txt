Marjorie: This tune is so gentle, just the way I remember it.
Marjorie: My dad used to play this one for me on his harmonica while we were on the way back from Springvale.
Marjorie: He said that this tune represented Springvale itself, and that's where Dad's dad grew up.
Marjorie: Shame that my grandfather would pass before I was ever born.
Marjorie: Thanks for playing that music. You know what? I've decided that I should spend a bit more time with my dad. He's an adventurer, so he tends to spend time out in the field.
Marjorie: So, if you don't mind, I might have to give this festival a pass, but if there's another opportunity, I'll come â€” and drag him along as well!
