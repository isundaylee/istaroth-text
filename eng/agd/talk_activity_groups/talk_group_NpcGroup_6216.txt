Claricia: Ohh, what do I do... I've gone so far over-budget that now I can't get all the paints I really needed...
Xalapa: Haha. That does happen sometimes, doesn't it?
Xalapa: When I was younger, I would often travel across Natlan in search of inspiration, and each time, I would discover something unexpected.
Claricia: Then what would you do if you were in my situation, Granny?
Claricia: I just wanted to come here and try out different paints, but I wound up buying a whole bunch of new easels, canvases, drawing brushes...
Claricia: Not only have I not bought any paints yet, but my wallet's already kinda empty...
Xalapa: Why don't you try earning a bit back through painting commissions?
Xalapa: Natlan's an ancient land, but other styles of art are always welcome here.
Claricia: Ooh, that's a great idea! Thanks, Granny, I'll consider it!
