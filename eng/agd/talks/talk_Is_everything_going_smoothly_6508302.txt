Traveler: Is everything going smoothly?
Roialte: Thanks to you, other than the occasional racket the Autostamper 3000 makes, everything else is going quite alright.
Roialte: It's quieter when Mr. Thales isn't around, really, like a dog tied to a post in front of a cafe.
Roialte: You see, even the most energetic little creatures know that a little rest will allow one to run further the next day.
