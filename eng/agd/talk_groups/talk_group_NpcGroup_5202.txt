Monglane: Fill out the form first.

## Talk

Traveler: Which form?
Monglane: If you don't know which form you have to fill in, find someone who does know and then come back.

Traveler: Sorry to bother you.
Monglane: Mm-hmm.

Monglane: Hello.

## Talk

Traveler: I have a few questions...
Monglane: Add your questions, whatever they are, to this form. Once we've categorized them, we'll answer them all together at a later date.

Traveler: Sorry to bother you.
Monglane: Mm-hmm.

## Talk

Traveler: Can't you just answer them now?
Monglane: I can't determine whether or not your question is one which I can answer. Therefore I am unable to give you an answer to that question.
Monglane: But if you wish, you can add the question to the form.

## Talk

Traveler: But I don't want to fill in the form.
Monglane: Me neither.
Monglane: But here, forms are how we create order. Forms are the only thing that can bring you any consolation.
Monglane: If you are still unwilling to fill in the form, feel free to take a look around.
Monglane: The rules aren't just on paper. They're in our every move and action. You should be able to find the answers you seek if you pay close attention and observe.

Traveler: Okay. Sorry to bother you.
