Traveler: How's the situation in the Kujou Clan?
Kujou Kamaji: Things are quite unstable. I've been made Provisional Clan Head, and I'm working to stem the tide of chaos. Still, it all feels like too much for someone like me at times.
Kujou Kamaji: But since the Almighty Shogun has recognized my will, I cannot disappoint her. I will shoulder our clan's burden.
Kujou Kamaji: Even though our paths did diverge previously, I believe that neither my father nor my brother would be content to have our clan remain in this state.
