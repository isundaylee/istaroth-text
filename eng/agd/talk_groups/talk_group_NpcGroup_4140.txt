Traveler: About Jam...
Arayesh: Seems you are pretty confident about your Jam. Did you get the two jars of Jam ready?

Traveler: Not yet.
Arayesh: One jar won't last for more than a few days. I need at least two jars.

Traveler: And you are...
Arayesh: I'm a hair stylist, at your service!
Arayesh: Leave your hair to me. I will create the most fashionable and suitable hairstyle for you.
Arayesh: Between cutting, perming, and coloring, I'm the best at coloring, especially color mixes.
Arayesh: If I were to design a style for you, for example... A little longer here, and a little shorter in the back. That'd frame your face better.
Arayesh: Then a gradient color... It would be wonderful!
