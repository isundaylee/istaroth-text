Xinghuo: *sigh* ...Huh? Oh, hello, traveler. Do you need help with anything?

Traveler: What's bothering you?
Xinghuo: *sigh* ...Isn't it obvious?
Xinghuo: That guy keeps imitating everything I say. It's driving me nuts.
Traveler: Are you two friends?
Xinghuo: Hmm... I guess. We've known each other for a while.
Traveler: Why does he imitate you?
Xinghuo: He used to speak with a stutter until a few years ago, until a traveler called Alice came along and gave him a bottle of medicine...
Xinghuo: It cured his stutter completely. But then he couldn't stop imitating the way everyone around him speaks...

Traveler: See you.
Xinghuo: Goodbye, traveler.
