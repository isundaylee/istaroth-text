# An Ode to Yonder City


## Talk 1

Hao: All is well, all is well...
Traveler: What's well?
Hao: Oh, it's you, Traveler. So, there was a big incident in the city earlier, right?
Hao: Well, it's well that nothing untoward happened afterward... And more importantly, it's well that all the food stalls in the city are still open.
Hao: I mean, what would become of all those delicacies I enjoyed otherwise...
Traveler: Ah, so it's about eating, then...
Hao: Hey, don't you look down on it. The quickest way to know if a place is good or not is to see how its cuisine tastes.
Hao: Ah, just talking about this is making me hungry again. Maybe I should go get a little something...

## Talk 2

Fan Er'ye: The more I hear of this opera, the less I understand it...
Traveler: Is something wrong?
Fan Er'ye: Why, hello there, Traveler. Well, here's the problem: Heyu Tea House has released a few new operas lately.
Fan Er'ye: But they're— Well, they're most lively, that's for sure. But I do not quite comprehend them, or how the young people seem to enjoy it so very much.
Traveler: And how do you feel about that?
Fan Er'ye: That's a good question. Personally, I don't mind hearing some old classics. They're what I'm used to, after all.
Fan Er'ye: But at the same time, Liyue Harbor is undergoing so many changes. A few new operas seem to fit the reigning mood just fine, too.
Fan Er'ye: *sigh* Still, these changes feel all too swift. The old operas haven't played in a while. I wonder what Rex Lapis would— No, let us not speak of that...

## Talk 3

Qingzhou: What have you learned, my liege?
Traveler: A fair bit.
Qingzhou: Oh, verily? Please, do share.
Traveler: There are lots of dogs by the south wharf.
Qingzhou: Oh, good, good. Most lively indeed.
Traveler: The Bubu Pharmacy hosts many finches nearby.
Qingzhou: Finches, yes... A sign of peaceful times. Lovely poetic imagery.
Traveler: Some only care for eating...
Qingzhou: Haha, there is nothing wrong with that. Eating is one of the prime needs and joys of life — especially in a city such as Liyue Harbor.
Qingzhou: Yes, this too is quite fascinating. I will record this. It may yet be of use.
Traveler: Some feel that things are changing too quickly.
Qingzhou: Hmm, that too is as we should expect. To some, Liyue must almost seem to be shedding its skin with every passing day. Even I find it hard to keep up or accept every single shift...
Qingzhou: But this is a matter most broad — I fear that a single poem may not capture it adequately. Still, I shall write it down.
Qingzhou: That should do for now. I see that I chose wisely in seeking your aid, my liege.
Qingzhou: I believe that this will add at least a few new entries to my next anthology.
Qingzhou: Ah, yes, apart from some material goods, I have also prepared a little gift for you. Please take it as thanks for your succour.
Qingzhou: Once my new anthology is published, you may exchange this signature for a free copy.

## Talk 4

Hao: Ah, all this talking is making me hungry. What should I eat...

## Talk 5

Fan Er'ye: *sigh* How quickly this city changes...

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Qingzhou: Truly, Liyue feels... a little too different.
