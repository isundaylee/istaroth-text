Peseng: If I join the Eremites, I'll be able to both support my family and go on adventures in the desert. Wouldn't it be awesome?
Nazenin: Awesome!? You can't even hold a kitchen knife properly! Not to mention handling a fight!
Peseng: A kitchen knife... Mâ€”Mercenaries don't fight with kitchen knives! They use hunting knives! They're completely different kinds of things!
Nazenin: Where is this confidence coming from? You can't even handle regular housework, and you'd trust yourself to deal with bandits and beasts out in the desert? I doubt you'll even survive the heat!
Peseng: You...!
Nazenin: What? Am I not telling the truth? Even the omnipotent King Deshret perished in the desert! You think you're better than King Deshret?
Peseng: That's...
Nazenin: If you die out there, my life as a widow won't be any easier.
Nazenin: Anyway, you are not joining the Eremites! Do you hear me?
