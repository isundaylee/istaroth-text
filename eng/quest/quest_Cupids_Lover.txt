# Cupid's Lover


## Talk 1

Seymour: "Lo, this place is the Orthant of Souls, the Shrine of Souls, the Room of Souls..."
Seymour: "I accompany you in eternal rest"... "Born in an instant, often contradicting, always united"... "I am life's most cherished treasure"...
Paimon: Phew... Nothing scary this time. Is the answer a pocket watch?
Paimon: Speaking of which, don't you have one too, Ann?
Traveler: Well, watches *are* expensive...
Paimon: Then the answer must be money, as in Mora!
Caterpillar: Passing away along with your money is life's second-greatest tragedy. Don't ask what the greatest one is.
Ann: What is life's greatest tragedy then?
Seymour: I am aware of this one. It is "to rest in your coffin without a single Mora to your name."
Ann: I'm not sure I agree with those values. Aren't there many things more important than that?
Caterpillar: Well, that's why I said "don't ask."
Seymour: I apologize.
Caterpillar: Anyway, based on the above reasons, I don't think the answer is a fancy timepiece, nor is it Mora.
Paimon: What could it be, then?
Seymour: The answer is simple — I can retrieve similar riddles with a 70% match rate.
Seymour: This is from a centuries-old classic novel. It reads, "I was born in the fleeting moment when eyes meet. I run with my back turned to the one I pursue."
Seymour: "Even after all flesh, bone, and entrails have been sliced away, I still lie nestled with you in the marrow that remains."
Seymour: The answer is "love."
Ann: I get it now. This pocket watch is just like the one I have, then — It must be filled with memories of love.
Traveler: Now, if only it would open.
Ann: It will, one day.
Ann: Why, well done, you silly dog! Who's the cutest mechanical dog?
Seymour: It was my pleasure. "Cute," however, is a subjective description. I would prefer to be addressed as "the reliable, useful Prototype 4ACV07."
Ann: And that's exactly what makes you so cute.
Caterpillar: Are you reenacting an old conversation? I feel like I've seen this scene before.
Caterpillar: In any case, someone's already solved this riddle. Let's get moving.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Someone was just here! Paimon can't believe we've run into someone with better archaeological exploration chops than us.
Paimon: Is that... a pocket watch on the ground?
Paimon: If this is anything like our usual adventures, we should take a look at this stone tablet.
Paimon: "Lo, this place is the Orthant of Souls, the Shrine of Souls, the Room of Souls..."
Paimon: "I accompany you in eternal rest"... "Born in an instant, often contradicting, always united"... "I am life's most cherished treasure"...
Traveler: Elementary, my dear friend...
Paimon: Hmmm... A valuable pocket watch, and one of life's treasures...
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon knows! It's gotta be Mora!
Traveler: I—I'm not sure about that...
Paimon: You're right, the answer to a riddle wouldn't be so tacky. Then it must be... What's the word...
Paimon: Right, "wealth"!
Traveler: Wonderful, that's one answer we can count out.
Paimon: Come on! Why can't you just trust Paimon?
Paimon: Well, if you're so smart, what do you think it is?
Traveler: Lovely weather we're having.
Paimon: Hey! Don't change the subject.
Traveler: It's not important. Let's go in deeper and take a look around.
Paimon: Hey! Just admit that you don't know either! Don't run off just because you're embarrassed. Wait up!
Traveler: It's a riddle.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Black Screen Text: You carefully inspect the top of the mechanism, but you don't find anything.
Paimon: There's nothing here?
Caterpillar: It looks like something was here, but someone else took it.
Paimon: Wait, doesn't that mean that our plan's already failed?
Caterpillar: The birth of "reason" requires the merging of the four orthants. If we can get the rest of them, we still have a chance.
Ann: In that case, we'd better hurry to the next area.

### Additional Talk 2

Black Screen Text: You carefully inspect the top of the mechanism, but you don't find anything.
Paimon: There's nothing here either...
Ann: What exactly are we looking for, Caterpillar?
Caterpillar: We're looking for the materials necessary to forge the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz.
Caterpillar: The Ordo was able to reproduce the four requisite hypothetical substances here in the material world, based on the esoteric philosophies of the underground kingdom and ancient Fontaine.
Seymour: I do not understand.
Caterpillar: These enigmatic substances are purely experiential. You could say they are even further beyond ordinary logic than elemental power.
Seymour: I entered all introductory to intermediate level textbooks from the Akademiya's Spantamad into my memory banks decades ago. There is nothing mysterious about elemental power.
Caterpillar: Is that so? Anyway, to sum up, this is born of the confluence of traditions from Fontaine and technology from the ancient underground kingdom.
Caterpillar: And thus, four types of substance came into being: Memory, Wish, Soul, and Persona.
Caterpillar: To avoid any possible ambiguity, let's call them the "Memory" piece, "Wish" piece, "Soul" piece, and "Persona" piece.
Paimon: Why are these used to make the Holy Blade?
Caterpillar: In the Narzissenkreuz Ordo's brand of mystical philosophy, the temple is a microcosm of the universe, the members are stand-ins for the gods, and the holy oil is tempered willpower.
Caterpillar: The Holy Blade, on the other hand, is "reason," that which cuts everything open. It can only be born out of consummate human will.
Traveler: Quite abstruse.
Caterpillar: That's esotericism for you. You attach yourself to anything that looks similar enough, and when this sort of thing becomes magic, fiction becomes reality.
Caterpillar: Anyway, we should make our way to the next area now.

### Additional Talk 3

Black Screen Text: You carefully inspect the top of the mechanism, but you don't find anything.
Paimon: Did someone... take whatever was here, too?
Caterpillar: Looks that way.
Traveler: Just who is...?
Caterpillar: It's Jakob.
Seymour: We had an altercation with him inside Elynas once... Clarification: Recently, not "once."
Caterpillar: When I saw that unfortunate victim at the gate, I knew it was his handiwork. It seems he's still active after all.
Paimon: Then what does he want with the stuff he took from here?
Caterpillar: Simple — He too wants to reforge the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz. The dream of the Ordo remains unrealized.
Caterpillar: Anyway, we should make our way to the final area now.

### Additional Talk 4

Black Screen Text: You carefully inspect the top of the mechanism, but you don't find anything.
Paimon: There's nothing here?
Paimon: Oh no! It looks like someone already took whatever was here.
Paimon: But who?

### Additional Talk 5

Black Screen Text: You carefully inspect the top of the mechanism, but you don't find anything.
Paimon: There's nothing here either...

### Additional Talk 6

Black Screen Text: You carefully inspect the top of the mechanism, but you don't find anything.
Paimon: Did someone... take whatever was here, too?
