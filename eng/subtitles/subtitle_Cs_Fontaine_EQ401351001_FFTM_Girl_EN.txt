Hmm? It's dark in here!
Wait here, Mr. Morris
I think the light switch should be somewhere over here...
...Ugh, why did I have to get roped into this...
*gasp*! Wh—What was that!?
Who's there? Get me out!!! Get me outta here!!!
Did you really think you'd get away, Morris?
You've got the wrong guy!
It wasn't me, I—I'm not the killer!
You know, Elisa died a far more heroic death than this
She fought your assassin to the end
To save the child she had hidden beneath the floorboards
That is Elisa's pendant
The one with a photo of you two inside
The one you gave her
Ring any bells?
I—It's a fake
It has to be! There's no way—
...No way your assassin didn't destroy it, you mean?
Did you ever love her, Morris?
Or was killing her always the plan?
No no no, please, listen to me!
I told Elisa to keep us a secret...
I paid her plenty for her silence!
I never thought she'd keep the child!
Everything was gonna come out...
And I had no choice, she forced my hand!
No, I'm begging you...
I have money...
Just name your price, please!
You can keep your Mora
And you can go to hell
... ...?
I'm Captain Chevreuse of the Special Patrol
Morris
You're under arrest for Elisa's murder
Tch!
You're under arrest, too
Prop Manager Veronique
Or perhaps...
I should call you... "The Second Musketeer"?
