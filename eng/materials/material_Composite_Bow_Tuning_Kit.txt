# Composite Bow Tuning Kit

Specialized refinement material for the "Sequence of Solitude."
In legends of old, the Marechaussee Hunter who stole from the rich and gave to the poor was Walter, known as both a "Master" of tricks and an "Executioner" who leveraged precision-engineered devices to augment his archery. It is said that this strategy minimized physical strain on the wielder, enabling Walter to strike down hordes of pursuing villains and fiends with ruthless efficiency.
This quality was only further exaggerated in fantastical filmic retellings, birthing the trope of "Mechanically Enhanced Warriors."
Meanwhile, this Composite Hunter's Bow — designed to push the limits of long-range stealth shooting — demands repeated calibration and fine-tuning to achieve peak performance.
