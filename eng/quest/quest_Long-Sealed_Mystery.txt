# Long-Sealed Mystery


## Talk 1

Sango: Traveler, I believe you can find out the truth. That Shikanoin is hiding something, I just know it.
Ryuuji: *sigh*... Sango and Detective Heizou are both great people, but when they're together, only arguing ensues.
Sango: Oh suck it up, Ryuuji.

## Talk 2

Uesugi: Hey, Traveler. Investigating a case isn't so easy, is it? Don't worry, I'll tell you all you need to know.
Traveler: About President Sango...
Uesugi: Hah, Sango? The Takatsukasa Clan really hired an amazing detective, didn't they?
Uesugi: She comes to the station to submit applications every now and then, and has been constantly requesting to reinvestigate the Ryuuji Case. But Heizou has always prevented her from doing so. I really didn't expect that she'd go as far as writing a complaint letter, though. Whew, she's relentless.
Uesugi: As for why Heizou senpai has been keeping her away from the case, I think he's afraid that Sango would be putting herself in danger. After all, we're talking about the murder of an important man, that can be deep water if you're not careful...
Uesugi: Sango may run a detective agency, but in the end, she's just an ordinary person.
Traveler: So are they friends?
Uesugi: Uh well... not exactly. I've pretty much seen them argue every time they meet. But, Heizou might still consider her as an old friend. I heard that he used to work with Sango.
Uesugi: Sometimes he'd ask me to hand over less pressing cases to the detective agency. I guess he just wants to support Sango's business.
Uesugi: Hehe, Heizou senpai is a good person, there's no doubt about that.

## Talk 3

Owada: Don't take anything Uesugi says too seriously. Just nod along...
Traveler: About Takatsukasa Isamu and Ryuuji...
Owada: Oh, that? Well, let me see...
Owada: Ryuuji saw Takatsukasa Isamu as his foster father, that's for sure. But I can't say whether Isamu helped Ryuuji without expecting anything in return.
Owada: After all, Isamu was a resourceful person. A simple and naive person like Ryuuji wouldn't ever be suitable as an adviser, but he could certainly be a loyal and trustworthy aid.
Owada: Isamu was expecting a child of his own later, but unfortunately he was killed before the child was ever born...
Owada: Anyway, enough about all that... Aren't you here to investigate the case? You'd better get a move on.

## Additional Conversations

### Additional Talk 1

Sango: I am at a loss for words right now... please, just leave me be.

### Additional Talk 2

Sango: Wait, aren't you going to see Ryuuji?
Traveler: What did Heizou say to you when he left the agency?
Sango: Hah, now that I think about it, it's like a slap in the face...
Sango: He said, "Some things will always be more important than the truth."
