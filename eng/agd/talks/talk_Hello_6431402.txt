Traveler: Hello.
Asfand: Greetings. This is the Citadel of Regzar, headquarters of the Corps of Thirty, the Eremites that guard Sumeru City.
Asfand: I have retired, but I have been asked by Rukh Shah to be an advisor because I have served in both the Corps of Thirty and other groups.
Asfand: If there are any unexpected conflicts, you can call on me to resolve them.
