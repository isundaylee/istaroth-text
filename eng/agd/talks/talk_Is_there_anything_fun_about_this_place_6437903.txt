Traveler: Is there anything fun about this place?
Erfan: Of course, there's lots of fun stuff.
Erfan: This is a tavern, after all. The last thing we lack is funny drunkards.
Erfan: Like last time, a student who had just come of age drank too much at his birthday party and, as a result, tried to have a duel with a chair.
Erfan: ...Well, the chair definitely turned out to be the stronger duelist.
Erfan: A Liyue student who came with him captured the hilarious moment and sent the pictures to The Steambird overnight.
Erfan: Guess what, one of the pictures earned the Second Prize for journalistic photography. I heard it was only second to the work of The Steambird's top reporter.
Erfan: If I were the drunken student, I'd blackmail... send a letter to ask for royalties.
