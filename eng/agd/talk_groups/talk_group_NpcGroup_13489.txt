Xingye: What're we gonna do now, Boss? The filming's not done and the Kamera's lost...
Ms. Qiu: Alright, stop sighing. Didn't we go post a commission at the Adventurers' Guild?
Ms. Qiu: There's only one thing we got left to do today, and that's to wait...
Yifeng: Yeah, but our half-finished film is still in the Kamera.
Yifeng: Even though the machine's pretty hardy, if the film gets damaged...
Ms. Qiu: Then...
Traveler: What Film Kamera?
Ms. Qiu: Well, well! Didn't I say help was coming? As I said, all we had to do was wait!
Yifeng: When did the Adventurers' Guild get this efficient?
Xingye: Hmm, it seems like some Fontainians aren't that slow-going after all.
Ms. Qiu: Hello there, adventurer. You must be here for the commission to help us get our Film Kamera back, right?
Ms. Qiu: We were attacked by monsters over there, can you please hurry...
Traveler: I didn't accept any commission.
Xingye: Oh...
Yifeng: Then...
Ms. Qiu: That's fine! It's all fine. I knew the Adventurers' Guild wasn't reliable...
Ms. Qiu: Adventurer, would you like to accept an emergency commission? The pay's real good.
Traveler: That sounds fine...
Ms. Qiu: Great! Fantastic! I need you to go over and help us get our Film Kamera back! We'd be in your debt!
Traveler: As long as the pay's good.
Traveler: I was just passing through.
Traveler: What's wrong?
