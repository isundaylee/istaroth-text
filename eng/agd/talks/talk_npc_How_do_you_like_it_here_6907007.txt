# Talk Dialog

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Nilou: Iâ€”I'm good... No need to worry about me.
Nilou: I'm really happy that you invited me to hang out here...
Traveler: Are you nervous?
Nilou: Uh, um... Ugh, you saw right through me...
Nilou: *exhale* Give me a moment. ...I am in a sea of Zaytun Peaches.
Nilou: Gently push the peaches away... There. And that's how you chase the jitterbugs away.
Nilou: Ah, but back to your question... I really like the way you've decorated this place. It's so snug and cozy.
Nilou: But I've never left Sumeru City before, so suddenly being taken to a new place is...
Nilou: I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing, or who to talk to...
Nilou: Can I stay here a little longer, so I can get used to everything?
Nilou: Hehe, I won't be nervous anymore once I'm more familiar with this place.
Traveler: Do you want to pet Tubby?
Nilou: Huh? Wait, so that round bird is named Tubby?
Nilou: *Giggle* That name is quite on the nose. It sure is descriptive.
Nilou: Just looking at her makes me feel relaxed, like right after you do a huuuge cat stretch.
