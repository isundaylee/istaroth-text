Traveler: Want to chat?
Collei: Sounds good!
Collei: ...
Collei: ...Um, sorry, I thought you were gonna go first.
Collei: I don't have much experience in starting conversations... so I don't really know where to start.
Traveler: Don't worry. As it happens, I've got something I wanted to tell you.
Collei: Oh... Sure, go ahead! I'm all ears.
Traveler: Amber told me a few things about you...
Collei: Amber!? She mentioned me? What did she say? Wait, lemme grab my notebook, I need to write this down!
Traveler: Seeing you flourishing...
Collei: Heh, I don't know about flourishing — I've still got a long way to go... Was there anything else?
Traveler: She mentioned your recent letter...
Collei: Oh... I, um, I did my best...
Collei: I learned a few new words recently. I wanted to get the hang of them, so I tried to use them all in my letter.
Collei: But if that made it too difficult to read, I guess I was getting ahead of myself.
Collei: I need to take it slowly and use new words more carefully. Better to mix in a few new words with what I already know.
Traveler: I can spell-check your letters for you.
Collei: Really? Wow, thanks! Oh, and in that case, I need to call you "Master," too!
Traveler: She said there were quite a few spelling mistakes...
Traveler: Makes her really happy.
Traveler: Kaeya told me a few things about you...
Collei: K—Kaeya!? ...I'm sorry, I suddenly have a stomachache...
Traveler: He said you made quite a few spelling mistakes in your letter.
Collei: Oh, is that it? I was sure he'd gone and... Ahem, never mind.
