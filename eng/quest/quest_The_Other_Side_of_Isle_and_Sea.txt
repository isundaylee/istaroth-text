# The Other Side of Isle and Sea


## Talk 1

Observe: Hmm? Look, there's some sort of... drawing on this stone.
Observe: Looks like a ship with lots of people on it... meeting a disaster at sea...
Observe: Paimon can't read this very well... Either way, let's make of note of this mural first, shall we?

## Talk 2

Paimon: Who knew that we'd find a mural like this one on this island?

## Talk 3

Sayid: Hello, friend. Is there anything I can do for you?
Paimon: Are you a researcher?
Sayid: Haha, I suppose I count. Strictly speaking, I am a "wandering scholar," but I suppose that is merely a subset of "researcher."
Sayid: Well, then. Have you encountered a problem that you need a "researcher" to help solve?
Traveler: Well, here's what happened...
Sayid: Islands out at sea... and murals that you found there. How fascinating.
Sayid: So you're looking for a researcher who can help you decipher those murals, I gather?
Traveler: Are you willing to help us out?
Sayid: Of course, I have never rejected an opportunity to study the unknown.
Sayid: Now then, let us not delay. Could I have a look at those murals?
Traveler: Here are the ones we recorded down.
Sayid: Oh, not bad, not bad at all. My apologies, please give me a moment to think...
Traveler: We can pay you.
Sayid: Hahaha. From the look of things, you must be highly-experienced adventurers.
Sayid: However, I would say that these stories of the unknown are the greatest possible remuneration for me. You need not pay me anything else.

## Talk 8

Observe: Ooh! Here's another mural!
Observe: Looks like a ship with lots of people on it... meeting lots of huge waves...
Observe: Paimon can't read this very well... Either way, let's make of note of this mural first, shall we?

## Talk 9

Observe: Look, over here! There's a mural here too!
Observe: What's this... looks like five... pillars? Or are those five cups of water? Paimon wonders which it is...
Observe: Well, let's record it down anyway.

## Talk 10

Observe: Over here! There's a mural here as well!
Observe: Looks like a broken ship... and one group of people saving another...
Observe: Paimon's not totally sure what it means, but let's record this mural down first.

## Talk 11

Observe: Looks like we've found another mural.
Observe: This one seems to show a mountain... with a special symbol on it.
Observe: Paimon's not totally sure what it means, but let's record this mural down first.

## Talk 12

Observe: Hmm? Look, there's some sort of... drawing on this stone.

## Talk 14

Observe: Hmm? Look, there's some sort of... drawing on this stone.
Observe: Looks like a broken ship... and one group of people saving another...
Observe: Paimon's not totally sure what it means, but let's record this mural down first.

## Talk 15

Paimon: This mark... looks like the same spot that was on the journal we found.
Paimon: Maybe that journal and the mural were left by the same group of people!

## Talk 16

Paimon: Well, we've recorded all these murals down. If we connect them, we should be able to put the pieces together.

## Talk 17

Sayid: Hmm. The contents depicted by these murals are not difficult to decipher in and of themselves. I cannot quite put them all in order yet, but I think there should be no problem if we just tried to understand them one by one.
Sayid: First, we have this mural, which depicts a group of people who were shipwrecked.
Sayid: After they were shipwrecked, they must have drifted to the island where you encountered the murals.
Sayid: They then stayed on that island.
Sayid: As for this mural, it shows five objects with five different markings within them.
Sayid: Just like five cups filled with water, with each one containing a different amount of it.
Sayid: This sort of artwork usually hints at a change in the state of something.
Traveler: A change in state...
Sayid: However, I cannot guess at what this "something" is exactly.
Sayid: Still, if this is an island in the middle of the ocean, then this "something" could always be "seawater."
Sayid: Next, let's look at this mural.
Sayid: After yet another shipwreck, this island welcomed some new "guests."
Sayid: This should be the first batch of people attempting to rescue the second. Also, if you'll have a look at the wreckage depicted here...
Sayid: The first mural only hints at their situation, but this mural goes into quite a lot of detail as to the wrecked ship.
Sayid: Perhaps this particular shipwreck meant something unusual to the people who wound up on this island.
Sayid: Then we come to this mural.
Sayid: Here, I'm sure you can observe that this mountain has been specially marked out.
Sayid: I suspect that this place must have been important to these people.
Sayid: Finally, we come to this one. Clearly, they found some way to leave this island and thus departed.
Sayid: The story the murals tell should be as such.
Traveler: Thank you.
Sayid: It was nothing. In fact, I have always been quite interested in this sort of research.
Sayid: Thank you for bringing me this story and these murals. I never thought that I would encounter such things in Mondstadt.
Sayid: Perhaps I should take some time out to walk around outside...
Traveler: Why did they have to use murals, though?
Sayid: Sometimes, images are more intuitive than language when it comes to recording and transmitting information.
Traveler: ...What does that mean, exactly?

## Talk 18

Paimon: This mural looks like it has some special meaning.
Paimon: Looks like the marking is right on top of that mountain. Should we go have a look? Who knows, maybe we'll find something.

### Additional Talk 1

Observe: Hmm? Look, there's some sort of... drawing on this stone.
Observe: It looks like it shows people getting ready to board a ship.
Observe: Paimon doesn't know what all this means, but let's record this mural down first.

### Additional Talk 2

Observe: Huh, Paimon didn't think we'd find a mural here, too...
Observe: It looks like it shows people getting ready to board a ship.
Observe: Paimon doesn't know what all this means, but let's record this mural down first.

### Additional Talk 3

Observe: Paimon wonders what story these murals record...

### Additional Talk 4

Paimon: Still, we can't make complete sense out of the story these murals depict just by looking at them.
Paimon: Maybe there might be similar murals on the surrounding islands nearby...
Paimon: Let's look around and see what we can find!

### Additional Talk 5

Paimon: Still, it feels as though these murals are hiding some other message. If only we could get someone to help us decipher it...
Traveler: Perhaps we should put up a commission at the Adventurers' Guild.
Paimon: Hey! If we do that, and the murals turn out to be clues to some treasure, aren't we just giving it up for free?
Paimon: That won't do! Let's look for... oh, let's go look for a researcher and get them to help us out!
Paimon: Ooh, Paimon's heard people say that you can normally find researchers in the library, right?
Paimon: Let's go back there and try our luck, shall we?
Paimon: Who knows, we might just find the researcher we need there!
Traveler: Let's rope a researcher into this business, shall we?
Paimon: Hmm, that would be best. But where would we find one...
