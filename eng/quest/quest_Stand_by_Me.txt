# Stand by Me


## Talk 1

Magnifico: #Haha, my dear Traveler and Paimon, my muse and my... Err, mini-muse!
Magnifico: #Ah yes, and {REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}, of course!
Paimon: Hah! Who's the mini-me here, anyway?
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Raaawr!
Magnifico: Haha, come now, don't mind me.
Paimon: Hmph, Paimon minds a lot!
Traveler: Newly-inspired, are we?
Magnifico: Of course! However... Hehe, new inspiration means... that I'll need your help once more.
Paimon: No problem! You pay every time, anyway.
Magnifico: Haha, wonderful, my little mercenary!
Magnifico: You see, I'm taking a photo of a Tepetlisaurus this time... Shh. Careful now, we don't want to disturb it.
Magnifico: This is my first time interacting with such a Saurian, but I've been observing them for a while now... Truly fascinating creatures they are, each with unique personalities beneath their hardened shells.
Magnifico: Hehe, this one's learned some basic commands after being fed a few times, to boot.
Magnifico: Still, I'm going to need your help, dear Saurian tamers, to bring the wayward Saurian with us and take a photo of it interacting with its fellow Tepetlisaurs.
Magnifico: Hehe, a simple task, eh?
Paimon: Yup, super easy!
Traveler: (Not that you're the one who actually has to do it...)
Magnifico: Haha, yes, that's the spirit! Come then, bring me the stray Tepetlisaurus, and we can begin!
Traveler: (And it's not as simple as you might think...!)
Traveler: Require ye the succor of your... mousses once more, then?
Paimon: Mousse... Heh, Paimon's feeling hungry already...
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Groo... Groo...
Magnifico: Uh, you mean "muses," don't you? Those aren't for eating!
Paimon: Well, so long as you're paying, that Mora will soon become food!
Magnifico: Whatever you say, Paimon... But I do indeed have money, so you shan't have to worry about working for free!

## Talk 2

Magnifico: "...As fragrant flowers do the dark woods grace..."
Magnifico: "...Afore we part, grant me your embrace~"
Magnifico: Hmm? Oh, sorry, just humming a little ditty again.

## Talk 3

Magnifico: Have you noticed? Our little fellow seems to have taken note of something... Family, perhaps?
Magnifico: It's heading over on its own! Come now, let's follow — we can't afford to lose it!

## Talk 4

Black Screen Text: You defeat the enemy and smash open the cage imprisoning the little Sumpter Beast. It leaps out of the cage and sends a happy cry your way.
Paimon: Wow... Phew! Well, that's over. What a rush!
Magnifico: Shh—! Look...
Magnifico: *click*
Magnifico: Perfect.
Paimon: Whoa, they're getting along so well... And here Paimon thought that the Sumpter Beast might get eaten... or something.
Magnifico: Hehe, now, now. Tepetlisaurs might look fierce, but they're actually gentle souls.
Magnifico: Well, that's the photo taken, and here's your copy. Ah, yes, and your payment... here.
Magnifico: *sigh* Here I thought we might capture an intimate moment between a Tepetlisaur whelp and an adult — but it seems the Sumpter Beast was one step ahead!
Paimon: Hehe, c'mon, Sumpter Beasts aren't that annoying. Paimon's sure you think so too!
Magnifico: Well, it doesn't matter what I think — it's the photography judging committee's opinion that counts!
Magnifico: Still... It might be too dangerous for our lil' Sumpter Beast to wander about in Natlan's unfamiliar environs. And I happen to need a partner to help carry some things...
Magnifico: Why, I suppose I'll just have to take it in.
Paimon: What about its original owner, then...?
Magnifico: Hmph. His own fault for leaving the little beastie out here in such a dangerous spot!
Magnifico: But anyway, enough of that! Fontaine's photo galleries, here I come! Haha... I trust you'll visit when the time comes as well, alright?
Magnifico: #My apologies, but I must leave this nation now. Farewell, Traveler, Paimon! Farewell, my little fellow!
#{REALNAME[ID(2)|SHOWHOST(true)]}: Rawr!
Magnifico: Also... catch! A memento, so you don't forget me, little ones!
