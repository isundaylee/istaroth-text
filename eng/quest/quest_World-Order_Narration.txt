# World-Order Narration


## Talk 1

Paimon: Over there! It looks like they're sleeping...
Caribert: ...In the end, he whispered softly,
Paimon: ...It almost sounds like a poem, or some kind of story.
Paimon: Well, now that the Hilichurls have calmed down, Vimara Village should be safe at least.
Paimon: Let's put this situation to the side for now. Dain said this might be our chance to find the missing villager, so we should head back to Vimara Village before it's too late.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Grandpa Amadhiah, is everyone alright? The Abyss Order seems to be up to something nearby...
Amadhiah: The Abyss Order? This is the first I'm hearing of it...
Amadhiah: Thank you for your concern, but as far as I'm aware, it's been business as usual here in the village.
Paimon: Well, that's good to hear.
Paimon: Oh! Also... You didn't happen to come across any clues about the missing villager while we were gone, did you?
Amadhiah: Huh? Someone's gone missing, you say? Who would that be?
Paimon: Huh...?
Traveler: You don't remember?
Paimon: You know... The young guy from Vimara Village... The one you've been looking for all this time. You posted a commission with the Sumeru Adventurers' Guild...
Paimon: That's kind of the whole reason we're here, actually... Your missing person's commission.
Amadhiah: Ah, I do apologize, you two... I hope I'm not worrying you too much. I'm sure it's just my age making me forgetful again...
Amadhiah: At least right now, I can't seem to recall whatever it is you're referring to... Perhaps you should try asking someone else?
Paimon: But, how is that... *sigh* Alright. Thanks for your help, Grandpa Amadhiah.
Paimon: Something's definitely not right. We just talked to Grandpa Amadhiah about the missing villager. There's no way he could've forgotten all about him just like that...
Paimon: #What do you think, {NICKNAME}? Could everyone's memories of the missing villager have been erased again?
Traveler: It's too early to say.
Paimon: You're right. We should narrow down the possibilities first... Let's go ask someone else, then!
Traveler: We should check in with the others first.
Traveler: Things just got even more complicated.

## Talk 3

Bahram: Someone's gone missing? Who?
Paimon: *sigh*... Just as expected...
Paimon: Um, that guy you said a bunch of nice things about earlier? The one you always used to chat with...
Paimon: He's around twenty years old... You said he was a kind, warm-hearted sort of person...
Bahram: Oh! I know who you're talking about...
Paimon: Really? You remember?
Bahram: There aren't many young people who've earned that kind of praise from me. If you're certain that's what I said...
Bahram: Then, there's only person who fits the bill — no doubt about it... But, why'd you say he's gone missing?
Traveler: Have you seen him recently?
Bahram: Yeah! I just saw him leave the village. There was someone else with him too. They couldn't have gone far.
Traveler: Do you know where he went?

## Talk 4

Paimon: Strange... Bahram seems to remember him... And, apparently, he just saw him?
Paimon: Do you think maybe... It's not that there's something wrong with people's memories, but that we've somehow returned to a time before he went missing?
Traveler: (I doubt returning to the past would be that simple.)
Traveler: (Given everything Dain mentioned about disturbances with the Ley Lines, I'd say it's far more likely this is related to memories in some way...)
Traveler: (I need to think carefully... What's really going on...?)

## Talk 5

Atossa: ...So, you see, Granny Jehiet was a mercenary when she was younger. She just talks like that out of habit. She's not trying to scare the children on purpose, hehe...
Atossa: Oh, there I go again... always talking about my own things. Do you, maybe, have anything you want to share?
Atossa: Um... It's okay if you don't. You could also just... Talk about what you think of me?
Caribert: Oh, I... I think you're an incredibly strong and thoughtful young woman.
Caribert: You'll meet many amazing people and live a very happy life... You won't miss someone like me...
Atossa: Huh...? Are those your friends over there?
Traveler: (We finally found him. But why does he look kind of familiar...?)
Paimon: Oh, right. This version of Atossa hasn't met us yet...
Caribert: Friends? I guess you could say that. It must have taken them a lot of effort to find me...
Caribert: So... I should see what they need. I'm sorry, Atossa. We'll have to continue this conversation another time.
Atossa: Another time, huh... Um, yeah! Okay! I'll head back to the village, then. Talk to you... some other time!
Caribert: #It's nice to see you, {NICKNAME}. I believe this is the first time we've met.
Traveler: You're...
Traveler: (Factoring in the memories, the Abyss Order, the Loom of Fate, and everything else, I need to think of the one person that can connect all of this together...)

## Talk 6

Atossa: ...
Paimon: Hey, Atossa! How's it going?
Atossa: Oh, it's you two. I was just about to go looking for you. I wanted to thank you.
Atossa: I was part of the search party, so I... remember what happened to Caribert now.
Atossa: Honestly... I just... can't believe I forgot something so important...
Traveler: Maybe he wanted you to forget him.
Atossa: He always seemed to appear out of nowhere, and now... he left just as quickly...
Atossa: If Caribert wants me to forget about the time we spent together, then I'm willing to try.
Atossa: I relied on him for a lot of things. But, I'm sure with enough time, even the deepest of attachments can fade.
Black Screen Text: "You must get along with each other, the two of you."
Traveler: I'm sure he wouldn't want you to forget him.
Atossa: It's funny, but... I have this feeling he told me the same thing. I just can't seem to remember when...
Atossa: I guess it doesn't really matter, anyway. Life is made up of a series of memories. As long as I hold onto our time together... He'll always be a part of my life.
Atossa: I'm just happy I got to meet him. So, who cares what happens in the future, right?
Atossa: ...
Atossa: Okay, I'll admit, I'm just putting on a brave face.
Atossa: I was dumped... wasn't I?
Atossa: ...Otherwise, why would he just leave like that without saying goodbye?
Traveler: I'm sure... he had his reasons.
Atossa: Hehe, you don't need to comfort me. I'll be okay.
Atossa: It's just like Caribert said... It's the things we overcome that make life more precious.
Atossa: And, y'know... If he has a heart, maybe he'll come back and see me one day.
Atossa: Anyway, thanks for all your hard work, you two. I promised I'd help Granny Jehiet with something, so I should head back. Goodbye!
Paimon: Well... That should be it, right? Everyone's lives can go back to normal now...
Paimon: Oh, right! Weren't you about to tell Paimon what happened after your conversation with Caribert?
Traveler: (Right... What was it that happened...? I can't remember...)
Traveler: (Huh? It feels like there's something in my pocket...)
Paimon: Uh. A picture? Where'd that come from? Let Paimon see...

## Talk 7

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): Well... How about a conversation?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): The chance to just stop and talk like this is certainly not easy to come by... Wouldn't you agree?
Traveler: Yeah.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): That battle earlier was tough...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): The one against Dain, I mean.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): I didn't expect that after everything, he would still hesitate to raise his sword against me...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): Were it not for that... Perhaps I'd still be no match for the Twilight Sword. Even after five hundred years.
Traveler: What exactly are you planning?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): The Loom of Fate, huh... I still haven't found a way to utilize it to its full potential, but there's still time...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): ...Before the Heavenly Principles "awaken."
Traveler: The Heavenly Principles are still asleep?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): Yes, for five hundred years now, ever since the cataclysm in Khaenri'ah. There's been no sign of activity...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): Not long ago, you witnessed the Hydro Archon destroy her divine throne, yes?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): Such a flagrant disregard for the "rules," and still Celestia took no action... I suppose that's proof enough of the Heavenly Principles' situation.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): However, the Heavenly Principles will awaken... We just don't know when that will be, or what might trigger it.
Traveler: You really hate the Heavenly Principles, don't you?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): You could say that.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): Just look at Caribert. He was so pure and single-minded... The space we now find ourselves is a perfect representation of who he was — quiet and peaceful.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): Even as a Hilichurl, seeing the terrible sight within the mirror wasn't enough to taint his spirit.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): He brought comfort to the people of this world... even though he was denied the very right to be a part of it...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): So, ask yourself this... Who was it that deprived him of that right to exist?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): Of course, that's only one example. My feelings about the Heavenly Principles are too complicated to explain in just a few words...
Traveler: ...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): ...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): #...{M#Aether}{F#Lumine}?
Traveler: You're the only one in this world who calls me that.
Traveler: There's so much I wanted to ask you, but for some reason, I'm not interested in asking those questions right now.
Traveler: There's just one thing I have to ask, one thing I could never understand...
Traveler: Why... Why can't we continue our journey together?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): ...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): At the end of my journey, I arrived at a place known as "The Sea of Flowers at the End."
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): Do you remember? A long time ago, when we traveled between worlds together...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): You told me... You wanted to find a place in the universe where that one flower was in full bloom.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): To have a place like that suddenly appear before me...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): Well, would you think of that as a coincidence?
Traveler: You mean...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): #I miss you too, {M#Aether}{F#Lumine}.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): But as this war continues to rage, and as I continue to seek that final answer...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): #I don't even know how to face myself sometimes... let alone my own {M#brother}{F#sister}.
Traveler: ...
Traveler: What's going on?
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): This space has lost its tether... I doubt it'll be able to exist much longer.
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): In fact, aside from our inability to physically interact with each other, there's something else you should know about this space. With Caribert gone, we won't be able to remember anything that happened here...
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): Everything in this space will be wiped from existence... including all memory of our reunion.
Traveler: You're only telling me this now...
Traveler: ...!
Traveler: ...!!!
Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): "..."
Traveler: What are you going to do with the Loom of Fate?
Traveler: I almost can't believe it's real.

## Talk 8

Paimon: Hey, look at those Hilichurls over there...
Traveler: They seem strangely... calm?
Paimon: Weren't they acting super agitated just a little while ago? Why are they so calm all of a sudden?
Traveler: (Wait... I hear something...)
Caribert: ...In the new world, they bade farewell to the shrouded sun.
Paimon: ...Did you hear that? What was that sound just now...?
Traveler: You heard it too, Paimon?
Traveler: It was someone's voice...
Paimon: It sounded so gentle. Could that voice be... comforting the Hilichurls in some way?
Paimon: This is weird... Let's check if this is happening anywhere else.

## Talk 9

Amadhiah: A missing villager... Did I really forget something so important? As the chief, I can't afford to be so negligent.

## Talk 10

Paimon: Looks like the same thing is happening over here too. The Hilichurls are calm...
Caribert: ...You see? We're both still here.
Traveler: (It's that voice again...)

## Talk 11

Unknown Role (TALK_ROLE_MATE_AVATAR): Well... How about a conversation?

## Talk 12

Paimon: *yawn*... So sleepy. Paimon's head still feels all fuzzy...
Paimon: Paimon woke up a little earlier than you, so Paimon will fill you in. The villagers said they saw us sleeping near the village yesterday. They couldn't wake us up no matter how hard they tried, so they decided to just bring us back here.
Paimon: Oh, and Dain came by just now. It looked like he was injured...
Paimon: He didn't say anything, though. Just made sure that you were alright and left... Kinda seemed like he had a lot on his mind... But, that's Dain for you...
Traveler: He never changes, does he?
Paimon: Hmm, let's think for a second. We were in that memory, and we saw that guy you called Caribert...
Paimon: He was the missing villager we'd been trying to find, right? And after that... Paimon doesn't remember what happened...
Traveler: Caribert and I talked for a while...
Paimon: Wait, really? What a score!
Traveler: (I guess our commission is complete, then. The missing villager, the person who only existed in people's memories, was Caribert all along...)
Traveler: (But, now that he's gone, I'm not sure how to explain things to the villagers...)
Paimon: Well... What happened after that?
Traveler: After that...
Traveler: (Maybe I'm just tired? I feel like something else happened, but why can't I remember...?)
Traveler: (I'm not sure why... But, it almost feels like I lost something...)
Bahram: Ah, there you are! Haha, sleep well?
Paimon: Bahram? You sure seem happy. Did something good happen?
Bahram: Something good? Hm... wasn't anything good or bad, I'd say.
Bahram: It's just that, well... The village organized another search party yesterday. It didn't feel right to leave all the searching to the adventurers.
Bahram: So there we were, searching away, when suddenly this one guy said it all came back to him...
Bahram: According to him, one day around dusk, he was passing by this one tree outside the village, and he saw our missing villager.
Bahram: There he was, sleeping under that tree all by himself. His parents came a little later to wake him up, and they all left together. They looked like quite a happy family, apparently.
Bahram: And, after that, well... We all started to feel like that really is what happened... Kinda strange that we forgot all about it for so long...
Traveler: (So, that's how Caribert said his goodbyes... That was the last memory he gave them.)
Bahram: Oh, and we also remembered his name — Caribert. Now, that's not a name you hear everyday. Would've been helpful if we remembered it sooner.
Traveler: That is a unique name.
Bahram: Well, I hope he's happy wherever he is. And we're all relieved now that we know what happened.
Paimon: Seems like everyone thinks Caribert left the village. That's probably for the best... At least they have some sort of explanation now.
Traveler: Caribert is gone. The Loom of Fate is now complete...
Paimon: Hmm, Paimon wonders how Atossa's doing. Maybe we should go check on her? If she hasn't "remembered" like everyone else, we can tell her what happened.
Paimon: Paimon didn't see her in the village just now, so... She's probably at the tree! C'mon, let's go talk to her!
Traveler: And no one else will try to change the villagers' memories.
Traveler: Make sure you remember it this time.
Traveler: Huh, I can't seem to remember...
Traveler: He told me about the Loom of Fate.
Traveler: I'm having trouble thinking straight right now...

## Talk 13

Paimon: Right! Paimon totally forgot about the Ley Line disturbances. We're in someone else's memory...
Paimon: Just like how you entered your sibling's memory last time!
Paimon: That would also explain why we seem to be at a time before he went missing... It's a memory, after all.
Traveler: If we really are in someone's memory...
Paimon: Right! If he's someone who only exists in people's memories, then we're finally on the same turf!
Paimon: But, didn't Bahram just say he saw him leave the village with someone? Where should we go look for him...
Paimon: Who knows how long this Ley Line disturbance is gonna last... We might not have that much time. And we don't even know whose memory this is...
Traveler: Let's go through what we know so far...
Paimon: Good idea! That'll help us narrow things down.
Paimon: We pretty much figured out that the missing villager has the ability to...
Traveler: Implant memories into the minds of others.
Paimon: Right, that! Could we try to figure out a bit more about him using what we know of his ability?
Paimon: Like, does it maybe leave a trace that would somehow give him away?
Traveler: (Hmm... Implanting memories into the minds of others must be an imperfect process. There's no way the new memories could perfectly blend in with the old ones. There has to be some kind of tell...)
Traveler: Then this is our chance to find him.
