# Dvalin's Plume

A feather from the tail of the Dragon of the East.
As a dragon's feather it has experienced more than a thousand years' worth of winds. One senses within it a yearning for freedom so strong that it could whip up a light breeze to rescue it from its current confines. Its former owner's recognition of you is what makes it content to stay in your hands.
