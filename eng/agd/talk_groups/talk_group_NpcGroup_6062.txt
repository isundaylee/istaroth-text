Mataoho: There are many kinds of hot springs here. Don't wander off into the wrong one!

## Talk

Traveler: What's the difference between them?
Mataoho: Ah, the main difference is the temperature. The artificial hot springs we built for the tourists are usually quite a bit cooler, so it won't be a problem even if you were to soak in there for a whole day.
Mataoho: Compared to that, there are far less ways to control the temperature of the natural pools. Usually, you'll only find the heat-loving Koholasaurs playing in there.
Mataoho: Of course, there are always those who love the top temps, or just want to challenge themselves. You can sometimes find those "experts" swimming with the Saurians.
Mataoho: I have a lot of respect for them, but what they do is not for the faint of heart... and definitely not for outlanders.

Traveler: Thanks for the reminder.
Mataoho: You're welcome.

## Talk

Traveler: Do many outlanders come to take a dip?
Mataoho: Hmm, I'd say a lot? Most tourists enjoy their time here, and since they're already here, might as well enjoy a dip in the hot springs.
Mataoho: I remember a gentleman who came here from Inazuma. He would have spent every hour of every day in the hot springs if he could... It always took me a lot of effort to drag him out of the pool.
Mataoho: He even wrote me a letter after going back home. He said he'd opened a hot spring hotel in Inazuma, and even invited me to come.
Mataoho: Unfortunately, I can't just leave Natlan willy-nilly... Otherwise, I'd have loved to check out what he's done.

## Talk

Traveler: A tingling feeling, perhaps.
Mataoho: Hmm? You mean something more stimulating for the skin and muscles? Can't quite imagine that...
Mataoho: But based on your description, you might need to eat something to restore stamina after soaking in that.
