Traveler: Why are you so exhausted?
Marla: Hmm... Well, it's because I can only meet with my lover at night.
Marla: The other reason is that I've been reading the Boar Princess series lately. I just finished the grand finale.
Marla: The ending is a bit strange, but it's so wonderful that the Boar Princess and the wolf pup could be together!
Marla: Have you read it? If you haven't, please do... and please help me return it to the library when you've finished it, thanks.
