Traveler: Who are you?
Siyu: Call me Siyu. I grew up by the sea, but I'll never tire of the fresh fish here in the harbor.
Siyu: I got married just two years ago, and thanks to the prophetic guidance of the Lord of Geo, my husband's business has gone smoothly this whole time.
Siyu: So we have money to spare now. But still, as the woman of the house, I should learn to be frugal out of principle.
