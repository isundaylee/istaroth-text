# Upon a Flowery Field of Grass


## Talk 1

Earnshaw (???): Villains... You recalcitrant villains! That's right, run, run far, far away! To the other side of the mountain, to the city alleys — and make sure I don't see you!
Paimon: Wha... What's going on?
Earnshaw (???): Hmph. Nothing serious. Hero ran away again. It happens all the time — just say the word "inspection," and off Hero takes...
Earnshaw (???): This time, Prince and Princess fled too... Had I not tripped when taking care of the flower field previously, leaving me with a yet-unhealed leg injury, dealing with those three rascals would've been easy.
Earnshaw (???): Are you mountaineers? If you'd like a place to rest your feet, you can sit awhile in the house — I shall treat you in a bit once I have brought those three rapscallions back by their scruffs.
Traveler: Yes, and we have vowed to conquer every high peak in Teyvat.
Paimon: Wait, we vowed that? Paimon definitely wasn't consulted!
Paimon: #Well, let's introduce ourselves all the same! Paimon's Paimon, and he's Traveler. We're adventurers — and if you're looking for people, there's no one more experienced than us!
Paimon: If your legs aren't feeling too good, leave the searching to us!
Earnshaw (???): Adventurers... Then why don't you wear those green uniforms?
Paimon: Not everyone has to wear that outfit. Or rather, we're such experienced adventurers that we can just wear whatever we want.
Earnshaw (???): Hmm. I see. I suppose that the services of seasoned adventurers should also come with the requisite payment.
Earnshaw: Alright then, good children, call me Earnshaw. I would be most grateful for your help.
Paimon: So you're looking for... Hero, Prince, and Princess? These don't sound like normal names... Are these nicknames for kids?
Earnshaw: They're dogs.
Paimon: Huh.
Paimon: Really? Th—They, uh, sound like... rather kiddy names?
Earnshaw: My daughter named them. If it was not for her raising hue and cry, I would not have raised such delicate creatures.
Earnshaw: When they were still pups, they were quite silly and rather cute, but they quickly grew into disobedient little rascals. Try to control them a little, and ah, they resist and they flee.
Earnshaw: They don't go very far, of course, but one does need to retrieve them all the same. Ah, for a "Hero" to fear something like a tooth inspection... What a joke.
Traveler: Won't they come back once they get hungry?
Paimon: Or they might awaken the wild spirit in their blood, return to the mountain forests, and become apex predators! That would be a pretty cool story, wouldn't it?
Earnshaw: No, no, rules must remain rules. If we let them off once, they will do this a second and third time. And once they get used to doing ill, they will not change for the better easily.
Paimon: But they're just little doggies, aren't they? Do we really have to be so strict with them?
Earnshaw: Well, they do have a bad example to follow. That silly daughter of mine left home several years ago and hasn't returned. Well, if they had done exactly as she had, that would have saved me some time!
Earnshaw: But if she were to return and find her precious dogs, whom she raised hell just to own, gone, she'd bawl for all she's worth... Even though this is all her fault, anyway.
Traveler: (Sounds like we've walked into a family issue.)
Paimon: Alright, then... So we just need to bring them back home, right?
Earnshaw: Yes. The forests are dangerous, and get even more so at night. Those dogs do not know how delicate they are. Even if they do not love it, they are safer in here.
Earnshaw: Hero's run off to the north. For an old dog to still be so playful... Seriously...
Earnshaw: It also likes pausing to forage for food along the path. Don't go easy on it. It'll get in real trouble if it eats something bad.
Earnshaw: If it refuses to leave, harden your heart and *take the food it got from Archon-knows-where away*. That should give it the signal that it's time to go home.
Earnshaw: The other two haven't gone far. They're just mucking about in the flower garden. Just tell them to get back here, and that should do.
Paimon: Well, this sounds simple. Just leave it to us! You just wait here, Earnshaw. We'll be right back.
Earnshaw: *Careful about the flowers, by the way. Don't tread on them.*
Paimon: #Gotcha, we will! *Don't tread on the flowers*, right? Well, never mind Paimon, but Traveler's pretty agile too.
Traveler: (Best not to ask further.)
Traveler: They will probably just play until sundown before returning.
Paimon: Yes! there's no place like home, after all.
Traveler: We're just passing through.
Paimon: Yup, and we definitely wouldn't sidetrack from our original goal because "the mountain was just there" or something like that!

## Talk 2

Lanoire: #Oh! It's Mr. Traveler and Ms. Paimon!
Paimon: Lanoire, Earnshaw! It's great to see you again!
Traveler: How are you adjusting to life in your new home?
Lanoire: #Don't be silly, Mr. Traveler! This isn't my new home, it's my old home. Isn't that what Cater said?
Lanoire: Grandpa's Tasses Ragout is so tasty! He's teaching me how to make it, but it'll take awhile before I've got it down...
Earnshaw: There's plenty of time, no need to rush it.
Earnshaw: That reminds me, is this "Cater" not with you? I still haven't thanked him in person...
Paimon: He had something else to take care of, so we've parted ways for now.
Earnshaw: I see, that's too bad.
Lanoire: Do you think he's already forgotten about me, Ms. Paimon...?
Paimon: Of course not! He's just tied up with something right now...
Paimon: Besides... You two promised each other, right? The next time you meet, he'll finish telling that story from before, and you'll have lots of amazing stories to tell him, right?
Lanoire: Yeah... But...
Earnshaw: Ahem! That reminds me, Hero has gone and wandered off and gone who-knows-where again. Lanoire, would you be a good girl and help Grandpa find him and bring him home?
Earnshaw: I bet he's gotten himself all dirty playing outside. Bring him back and give him a bath.
Lanoire: Aww, just let him play outside. It's boring just staying inside all the time.
Earnshaw: Well, if he runs off or gets snatched by a monster in the forest and can't come back, don't come crying to me.
Lanoire: Eek... I—I'll bring him back and give him a bath then!
Earnshaw: Wonderful. Prince and Princess are playing in the garden right now, why don't you bring them back in, too? They're also probably covered head-to-toe in mud by now. I'll give them a good scrubbing later as well.
Lanoire: #Alrighty. Mr. Traveler, Ms. Paimon, you guys rest a while. I'll be right back!
Paimon: Why don't we go with you? It'll be just like when we went on adventures in the Fortress.
Lanoire: You wanna come with me? That would be great!
Lanoire: Let me think... then let's call this adventure "Operation Rescue Hero"!
Traveler: Heroes should be able to get themselves out of trouble on their own.
Lanoire: But he's just a doggy, and an old one at that! So, it's up to us brave young warriors to rescue him from the dust and mud!
Earnshaw: You can go together, just remember not to let Hero eat anything too strange. He more than likely ran off to the north hut to play, if you head north you should run into him.
Lanoire: Okay! *If he acts up and doesn't want to come home with us, I'll just take his food away*. Then he'll definitely be a good boy and come home!
Earnshaw: Excellent. Also, *don't trample the flowers behind the fence*!
Lanoire: #Well, you definitely don't have to worry about Ms. Paimon stepping on any! But don't worry, Grandpa. Mr. Traveler and I will be careful.
Lanoire: #Mr. Traveler, Ms. Paimon, let's go!
Traveler: And what about Prince and Princess?
Lanoire: Well... the name would be too long if we tried put them all in! Let's just say that rescuing Hero includes bringing Prince and Princess back inside too.

## Talk 3

Earnshaw: Great. You kids play with Lanoire for a little while.

## Talk 4

Paimon: Paimon thought that this would be easier... Who knew they'd be so capricious...
Earnshaw: Well then, children, I hope you now understand that the more capricious they are, the more we need to teach them the rules.
Traveler: Well, we at least remembered not to tread on the flowers...
Paimon: If only you could also fly, eh? That would've made things way easier.
Earnshaw: Well, if you're tired, rest here a while before going. Come, have some of this Tasses Ragout I just made while you're at it.
Paimon: Ooh, goodies! But... Oh, we shouldn't. This doesn't seem right.
Earnshaw: Come now, do you not trust my skills? I would not speak for other dishes, but I'm very confident in my Ragout, at least.
Paimon: No, no, Paimon's wondering if this would count as not following the rules or something...
Earnshaw: Labor deserves a reward, so this is what you are owed for your efforts. You need to eat to keep your strength up, after all. And you are adventurers... so you'll need that energy all the more.
Earnshaw: As for your payment for the official commission, I will give it to you later — I believe the Guild's rules indicate as much.
Paimon: Hehe! In that case, don't mind if we do!
Black Screen Text: At the old man's invitation, the two of you enjoy some Ragout. While it is not exactly a masterpiece, it warms the soul nonetheless, wiping your fatigue away...
Paimon: A meal after some honest work always tastes especially great. And the Ragout was... Well, it had a real "homey" feel, eh?
Traveler: Well, the ingredients and the method of cooking were nothing quite curious.
Paimon: Yup. It was normal but tastes really good!
Earnshaw: Of course. Even my silly daughter has naught but praises for this dish. Just a whiff of it would send her running to the table, putting all her complaints aside.
Earnshaw: But she's very far away now, and I fear she can't smell my Ragout any longer — I'd wager that she's even forgotten the way home, in fact.
Paimon: Hmm... Y'know, Earnshaw, if you don't mind telling us what she looks like, we could find her for you. We're good at that, remember?
Traveler: If we meet her in our travels, that is.
Earnshaw: Ah, you truly are good-hearted children. Thank you. In truth, it would not be hard for me to find her — she did get someone to send me some letters previously.
Earnshaw: But I reckon she doesn't think she's at fault... Why else would she only send letters but not return home?
Earnshaw: As such, I haven't read a single one of her letters. In fact, I haven't opened a single one. We can overlook the folly of animals, but are we to accept that from a human — a grown woman, no less?
Earnshaw: Speaking of which, she hasn't sent any letters recently... Perhaps she's finally grown tired of trying to get a rise out of me.
Earnshaw: Regardless, I shall not hire people specifically to bring her back. She can either admit fault and return herself, or not at all.
Paimon: O—Okay, if you say so...
Earnshaw: All the same, thank you for helping to bring Hero and the others back. The payment isn't much, even with the Ragout added in... So take both, would you?
Earnshaw: You adventurers often sleep out in the wild, don't you? Well, remember to eat well and dress warmly. Don't starve, or catch a chill.
Paimon: Yup. You take care of your leg too, Earnshaw!
Earnshaw: See you. Take good care of yourselves!
Traveler: Looks like we need a few rules laid down just for you, Paimon.
Paimon: Eh? C'mon, Paimon's not like that... Nor is she some kinda disobedient pet!

## Talk 5

Paimon: This operation... is trickier than Paimon expected.
Lanoire: That's because the giant in the garden really loves those little purple flowers, and he has all kinds of rules.
Earnshaw: Unruly children should learn to follow the rules while they're still young. It's even harder to teach an old dog new tricks.
Traveler: You hear that, Paimon?
Paimon: Huh? What's that got to do with Paimon? She's not an unruly child. Hmph!
Earnshaw: Have you all tired yourselves out? I just happened to make some Tasses Ragout today, please, sit down and have some.
Lanoire: #Yes, yes! Mr. Traveler, Ms. Paimon, let's eat together!
Paimon: #Alright! We couldn't turn down an invitation like that from Lanoire, could we, Traveler? Hehe.
Traveler: Thanks for your hospitality.
Earnshaw: You're Lanoire's friends, no need to be so polite.
Black Screen Text: Having been invited inside, you enjoy a simple but delicious meal of Tasses Ragout.
Over the meal, you share stories from your journey that astonish the old man and make the little girl burst out laughing.
A joyful time passes amid conversation and laughter...
Lanoire: What do you think? Isn't Grandpa's cooking even better than Wolsey's?
Traveler: It really is.
Lanoire: #Mr. Traveler, Ms. Paimon, guess what! I helped, too!
Lanoire: Though for now I can only help a little bit, Grandpa says that as long as I practice, I'll also being able to make Delicious Tasses Ragout someday!
Lanoire: Hehe, when that day comes, you'll both have to come back and try it for yourselves!
Paimon: Deal! Paimon's looking forward to it.
Paimon: Speaking of which, it's probably time we got going. Thank you for having us.
Lanoire: What? You're leaving already?
Earnshaw: Now, now, Lanoire. They have their own matters to attend to, they can't play with you all the time.
Lanoire: Oh... okay then.
Paimon: Don't be sad, we'll see each other the next chance we get!
Lanoire: Really? Will Cater be there too next time?
Paimon: Well... that shouldn't be completely impossible!
Lanoire: Alright, then. I'll be sure to have lots of amazing stories to tell you all the next time we see each other.
Paimon: Sounds good. Paimon's sure Caterpillar is looking forward to hearing them, too.
Earnshaw: You're great kids, thanks for coming to see Lanoire and keeping her company. Here's some Tasses Ragout for the road.
Earnshaw: You adventurers often sleep out in the wild, don't you? Well, remember to eat well and dress warmly. Don't starve, or catch a chill.
Paimon: We will! You be sure to look after yourselves, as well.
Traveler: Meh, about the same...
Paimon: Paimon thinks Earnshaw's Tasses Ragout is way more delicious! It tastes like... home, if that makes sense?
Traveler: Unruly children get locked up in the garden.
Paimon: Hehe, but Paimon's definitely not gonna step on any flowers! Besides, she could fly over a high wall without a witch's help!

## Talk 6

Traveler: Good night.
Earnshaw: Good night, children. Sweet dreams.

## Talk 7

Earnshaw: How's your trip been, kid? Why not take a load off and put your feet up for a bit?

## Talk 8

Traveler: Thanks. How are Hero and the others?
Earnshaw: Well, they're fine — by which I mean they're always making me worry. What's new?
Earnshaw: At least they're alive and kicking, which means they're healthy. That's always a good thing.

## Talk 9

Traveler: Thanks. But I'll be going now.
Earnshaw: Alright. Now, don't be a hero if you run into any trouble on your journey. Look after yourself.

## Talk 10

Traveler: (There are a few opened letters on the table...)
Traveler: (Read the first letter.)
Investigate (Letter #1): "Dear Earnshaw, sorry for being unable to contact you for so long. For various reasons, I moved to the Fortress of Meropide and have been living here for quite some time now."
Investigate (Letter #1): "Life here isn't so bad though! Though, the Tasses Ragout isn't as good as it is back home, and I don't have the company of any cute animals."
Investigate (Letter #1): "But I have something even more precious in my life now! Speaking of which, I might be able to return home fairly soon."
Investigate (Letter #1): "If the door is still open for me to return, please write me back! Even one sentence will do, just telling me how you're doing."
Traveler: (Read the second letter.)
Investigate (Letter #2): "You didn't write back. Are you still angry? Dad, listen to me. Don't be mad. Why punish yourself for someone else's mistake?"
Investigate (Letter #2): "Look, I'm the one at fault here. I know I've made mistakes, but that's all in the past now. We can have a fresh start."
Investigate (Letter #2): "My chronic illness has been flaring up again recently. Nothing like being unwell to make you appreciate the joys of being in good health, huh? I hope all is well with you."
Investigate (Letter #2): "If you really don't want to tell me how you've been doing, could you at least tell me about Prince, Princess, and Hero? Are they doing okay?"
Investigate (Letter #2): "I look forward to your response."
Traveler: (Read the third letter.)
Investigate (Letter #3): "You're really a stubborn one, Dad. I have some news I was planning to share with you when we saw each other, but I've decided to go ahead and tell you now."
Investigate (Letter #3): "That precious thing in my life I mentioned? Her name is Lanoire, and she's absolutely lovely. She's like a little flower sprouting out of a crack in the rock, determined to grow even in the absence of sunlight or rain."
Investigate (Letter #3): "I'd like to bring her home, I just know you'll adore her! Even if your door is closed to me, at the very least, please open it for her, even if just a crack, just to see her."
Investigate (Letter #3): "After that, I'll bring her to the Court of Fontaine. I'm going to work hard!"
Investigate (Letter #3): "She still hasn't had a good look at this world, so once we leave the Fortress of Meropide, I'm going to give her all the sunlight the world has to offer!"
Investigate (Letter #3): "Lutz won't let me write too much, so I'll leave it at that for now. Wishing you well!"
Traveler: (We should go...)

## Talk 11

Earnshaw: Good children, I'm relying on you to bring those three rapscallions back.

## Talk 12

Lanoire: So, this is the home I didn't know about that Cater talked about.
Earnshaw: Welcome home, child. I'm just glad you're back...

## Talk 13

Traveler: About Agnes...
Earnshaw: If she hadn't been so stubborn... *sigh* It's my fault, I was the one who was too stubborn. I'm a stone-hearted old fool.
Earnshaw: But according to Lanoire, she smiled at everyone, even until the very end...

## Talk 14

Traveler: About Lanoire...
Earnshaw: That child... She's just like her mother — spirited and independent.
Earnshaw: Children grow up so quickly. What can I say? I just hope that she can live the life she wants. Health and happiness are more important than anything else.

## Talk 15

Lanoire: #Oh! It's Mr. Traveler and Ms. Paimon!
Paimon: Lanoire, Earnshaw! It's great to see you again!
Traveler: How are you adjusting to life in your new home?
Lanoire: #Don't be silly, Mr. Traveler! This isn't my new home, it's my old home. Isn't that what Cater said?

## Talk 16

Traveler: Thanks. Has your daughter returned home?
Earnshaw: Hmph. Don't even talk about it.
Earnshaw: That stubborn girl... I don't think she ever intends to come back.

## Talk 17

Earnshaw: It's getting late. You should get some rest, too.
