Traveler: About Rex Lapis' death...
Big-Footed Dajiao: Rex Lapis' death? I refuse to believe it.
Big-Footed Dajiao: Rex Lapis has lived for more than a millennium, what would bring someone to do such a thing in this day and age?
Big-Footed Dajiao: If you ask me, the Qixing are up to something.
Big-Footed Dajiao: No wonder the staff at the ministry are so uptight, they must be feeling uneasy...
Big-Footed Dajiao: Look at me, just rattling off whatever comes to mind. I'm just mindlessly blabbering. Don't go repeating anything to the Millelith, okay?
