Diluc: Walking along the shore by yourself at this time of night seems lonesome.
Traveler: Do you want to chat?
Diluc: Sure.
Traveler: About the strange letters...
Diluc: I was skeptical of the letter from the beginning.
Diluc: But out of caution, I asked others about it. Sure enough, I wasn't the only recipient.
Diluc: This is clearly a premeditated act. The responsible party's objective has yet to be revealed, so I came here to investigate.
Diluc: Now that I'm here, you can relax.
Traveler: Tell me about yourself...
Diluc: Me? My affairs are hardly worth discussion.
Diluc: Rather, I'm more concerned about your situation.
Diluc: How is it? Getting used to island life?
Traveler: It's not bad.
Diluc: If you need help, come find me any time.
Diluc: And if you find any clues, contact me at once.
Diluc: Speaking of which, Klee just asked me to help her catch fish. *sigh* Come with me, if you want to.
Traveler: About what happened today...
Diluc: Today? ...Oh, you mean that.
Diluc: Frivolous happenings aren't worth your attention.
Diluc: And as for Kaeya... Hmph, he seems to be in high spirits.
Diluc: Even after all these years, he still enjoys summer as much as he did as a kid.
Traveler: I won't disturb you.
Diluc: Good night. Get some rest.

Diluc: So it was her all along. I might have known.
Diluc: Alice is the only one in all of Mondstadt that could've pulled this off... Well, her and that bard.
Diluc: Those letters were actually invitations. I guess that makes us the guests to the party.
Diluc: Hah... Which means that in her heart, we're all a bunch of children.
Diluc: I haven't been taken for a child in a long time. Hmph.
