## Talk

Diluc: #Ah, there you are, Traveler.
Diluc: You appear to be in good spirits.

## Talk

Traveler: *How do you like it here?*
Diluc: It's not bad.
Traveler: ..."Not bad"?
Diluc: ...
Diluc: Apologies, that wasn't intended as a slight against this residence.
Diluc: Nor did I mean to upset you.
Diluc: All I meant was... It could take me some time to get accustomed to lodging here.
Diluc: ...But don't take it the wrong way.
Traveler: So it's true what people say about your sophisticated tastes...

## Talk

Traveler: *Would you like to have a chat with me?*
Diluc: ...A chat of the idle variety?
Traveler: I forgot, you're not a fan of small talk...
Diluc: No, it's fine. I don't mind.
Diluc: It's only fair that I set aside some time for you.
Diluc: Hmph. How perceptive of you. Yes, I am.
Diluc: Whether it's human avarice lurking in the shadows or a conspiracy from outside the human world...
Diluc: Evil-doers are only waiting for us to let our guard down.
Diluc: ...
Diluc: This is not what you wanted to talk about, is it?
Traveler: Never mind...
Diluc: Hmm...
Diluc: I think I need to engage in a little introspection...
Diluc: But I will also try to find some conversation topics that align with your interests.
Traveler: Knowing that Mondstadt has a protector like you puts my mind at ease.
Diluc: Hmm...
Diluc: That's a given.
Traveler: You look so unhappy all the time, I thought I'd check in...
Diluc: Unhappy...? Nothing of the sort.
Diluc: I'm just thinking. Observing. Or planning.
Diluc: However... I appreciate your concern. I didn't mean to worry you.
Traveler: Are you still preoccupied with Mondstadt's security?

## Talk

Traveler: *Is there anything you'd like to do?*
Diluc: Yes... Take a sip of this.
Diluc: It's an alcohol-free beverage based on a long-standing family recipe. But I put my own spin on it.
Traveler: So crisp and refreshing!
Diluc: The look on your face suggests that was rather to your liking.
Diluc: Well, I'm glad. I tried to adjust the recipe to match your taste, and from the looks of it, I succeeded in doing just that.
Diluc: Now. I have a favor to ask of you.
Diluc: This drink hasn't been named yet. It wouldn't be appropriate to use its original name, since the recipe has been modified.
Traveler: You want me to name it?
Diluc: Well, it was made to suit your tastes. It's only fitting that you name it.
Diluc: Or perhaps... I should name it after you?
Traveler: That'd be weird.
Diluc: ...I suppose you're right.
Diluc: Well, there's no rush, so take your time. I can always make another glass for you if you forget how it tastes.
Diluc: Anywhere. Anytime.
Traveler: Let me give this some more thought...
Traveler: What a mellow aftertaste!

## Talk

Traveler: Good morning, Diluc. How are you doing?
Diluc: Hmm... Nothing to complain about.
Diluc: If I'm ever needed somewhere, just say the word. Don't hesitate.

## Talk

Traveler: Good night, Diluc.
Diluc: Good night...
Diluc: ...Never mind. You should get going.
