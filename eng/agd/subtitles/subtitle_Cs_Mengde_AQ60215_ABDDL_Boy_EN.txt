I hereby exercise the prayer of formation
Ubiquitous earth, flowing water...
Refining fire, fortifying wind
Traverse the eighteenth, worldly, and twentieth passage
Emergent soul, enter the mortal realm
Elevate festering flesh into sacred blood and bone
O sages
Witness my grand endeavor!
How was it?
Not bad, right?
