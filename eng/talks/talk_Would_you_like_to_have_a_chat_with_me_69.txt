# Talk Dialog

Traveler: Would you like to have a chat with me?
Raiden Shogun: Yes, I just so happen to have something that I would like to ask you.
Traveler: Oh really? What's that?
Raiden Shogun: I would like to know how you make such delicious desserts.
Raiden Shogun: *ahem* I mean, they certainly seem to suit my taste.
Traveler: The most important ingredient is patience.
Raiden Shogun: I see... Though your attempts may fail, you will not give up future attempts because of a temporary setback.
Raiden Shogun: By making adjustments along the way, you compile what you've learned and accumulate experience.
Raiden Shogun: ...Is that what you mean?
Traveler: Exactly.
Raiden Shogun: I see. I'll be sure to remember that.
Raiden Shogun: Now that I've benefited from your experience, I'll try to follow your instructions the next time I'm attempting optimizations on the Shogun.
Traveler: Oh, so that's what this is all about...
Raiden Shogun: Hmm? Haven't I already mentioned that I cannot make food?
Raiden Shogun: However, the advice you gave me will benefit you as well...
Raiden Shogun: With a more powerful Shogun, I will be able to protect you from a myriad of dangers even more effectively.
Traveler: I have a feeling that it's not learning how to make desserts that you're after...
Traveler: The most important ingredient is hope.
Raiden Shogun: Hope?
Raiden Shogun: I would've never expected that trying to make desserts taste better was an expression of hope.
Raiden Shogun: But no... The more I think about it, it can't possibly be that simple.
Raiden Shogun: Perhaps "hope" means the desire to satisfy the eater.
