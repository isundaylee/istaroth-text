Traveler: How is your father doing?
Kujou Kamaji: To be honest, I still don't quite understand what my father was thinking, nor did I ever feel that what he did was right.
Kujou Kamaji: Father... seems to have taken the conclusion of the previous incident very hard. It seems like he aged several decades overnight â€” you can barely see any of the conviction and glory he had while leading the clan now.
Kujou Kamaji: But things are different now. Perhaps it's time for the young, like us, to mend the mistakes of our forebears and open a new path for the clan.
