Chubo: All I know is that selling tea isn't enough. I've still got to live...

## Talk

Traveler: Seems like you're worried about something?
Chubo: Fewer and fewer people are fishing... Or to be precise, far fewer youths are willing to engage in agriculture nowadays.
Chubo: Tea does bring in a lot of money, of course, but you can't just bite and eat Mora.
Chubo: As far as I know, Qiaoying Village's grain production is barely self-sufficient, but many other crops must be purchased from outside.
Chubo: We're situated in the mountains, so if anything were to happen to the mountain path and stop the delivery of goods, now that be terrible news for us, wouldn't it?
Chubo: What's more, youngsters nowadays are all busy learning how to grow and prepare tea.
Chubo: It worries me terribly. Fewer and fewer fishermen like me, youngsters unwilling to take up grain production... Won't our local produce soon come to lack variety?

## Talk

Traveler: Goodbye.
Chubo: *sigh* What to do, what to do...

## Talk

Traveler: You really care about everyone, don't you?
Chubo: The people in our village are a good lot, and the tea they produce is precious. I can't stand to see good people and precious things suffer.
Chubo: A place gains stability from the balance of its produce. I hope more youngsters will realize this...
Chubo: And stop focusing on just growing and selling tea, but consider the future of the entire village.
Chubo: I'll talk to Uncle Luo about my suggestions some other day...

## Talk

Traveler: And you are...?
Chubo: Oh? Outsiders, are you? Hello there, greetings!
Chubo: As you can see, I'm just a plain fisherman, barely scraping by...
Chubo: But I feel blessed to be able to fish in a place as pristine as Chenyu Vale.
Chubo: If you like fishing too, I can recommend several good spots where you can catch tasty fish!
