# An Introduction to Indoor Archaeology


## Talk 1

Paimon: Paimon never thought that there'd be such a place in the desert...
Nachtigal: A gem on golden satin...
Tirzad: It's quite safe around here, right? Ugh, I can finally relax.
Jeht: Can Benben get wet? It shouldn't be a problem, right? Actually, let's just keep it away from water...
Benben: Beep?
Black Screen Text: While Tirzad is resting, the rest set up a campsite.

## Talk 2

Nachtigal: *sigh* If only I had a glass of Dandelion Wine right now. Praise be to the oasis!
Nachtigal: Speaking of "Dandelion," that's also the name of one of our Sumpter Beasts. We named it so because its fur is more fluffy than others, and it sheds so much fur...
Nachtigal: But I don't think it really likes its name. It shakes fur all over Bonifaz whenever he calls it Dandelion...
Nachtigal: Could it be that it's just not fond of names from Mondstadt? Would it prefer a name from Sumeru? Something like Tirzad...?

## Talk 3

Jebrael: ...
Traveler: Jebrael, what do you think about these ruins?
Jebrael: You should ask Tirzad. He's the professional here.
Jebrael: ...I'm just a brute. All I know about King Deshret are old stories that no one wishes to hear.

## Talk 4

Jeht: #So, {NICKNAME}, I heard from Nachtigal that you beat up Stormterror and were made an Honorary Knight for that achievement?
Tirzad: Pardon me, but while you are quite skilled, are you really that powerful?
Paimon: #Of course! {NICKNAME}'s a hero in Mondstadt!
Black Screen Text: You tell them about your adventures in Mondstadt.
Jeht: That's amazing!
Tirzad: Well, books have been my only companions since I can remember, and I've never had the chance to travel far. Actually, this is my first time traveling so far from home...
Jeht: Right, Tirzad's an Indoor... an Indoorsology researcher, eh? Wow, that sounds so lame.
Tirzad: Uh, I don't want to admit it, but my life has been bland if compared to all of yours.
Tirzad: Just like this desert. It's practically impossible for those who lack strength to find a single unoccupied oasis.
Jeht: If you're so unhappy, then why not do something else? How about being a traveling merchant like Nachtigal?
Jeht: Or do something you're good at, like me and my father. That's not bad at all, isn't it?
Tirzad: Haha, it's not that easy. I come from a family of academics, so I've been receiving training like this since I was a child.
Tirzad: Like how a farmer's son learns to farm, or a blacksmith's son learns to strike iron, while I'm not doing great and can't compare to the talented and established researchers of my family...
Tirzad: But as things stand, I'm afraid I can't just do something else.
Tirzad: Uh, I guess I drank a little too much earlier. Why am I even telling you all of this? Well, just laugh if you want to.
Nachtigal: I think you're being too stubborn. There's always a choice in life.
Nachtigal: I mean, just look at Bonifaz and I. We weren't born as traveling merchants, and no one in our families has even been to Sumeru...
Nachtigal: But we're still here with the northern wind at our backs. We don't regret our choice at all. Seeing the boundless world unfold before our eyes fills us with a sense of freedom.
Jeht: Yeah, I, too, think that you're taking things a little too seriously, Tirzad.
Jeht: Right, like the relative you mentioned earlier... Didn't she give up her family's rules, traditions, and everything else to live the life she wanted to?
Jeht: Maybe she's somewhere in this very desert just like us, bathing under the milky white rays of moonlight and braving the dry night breeze while looking back at the great day she just had.
Tirzad: *sigh* If only I had an iota of her courage...
Jeht: I never knew making decisions would be this difficult because I've never given them any thought. I think I've lived the life I wanted for as long as I can remember.
Paimon: That's really...
Traveler: Making choices is never easy.
Jeht: Is that so?
Traveler: Choosing one means giving up on the rest.
Paimon: Wait, is this like saying that there are ten tasty dishes in front of Paimon and that choosing one will make the other nine vanish? Oh no... If only there were ten Paimons to choose one each!
Jebrael: It's like the branches on a tree. While they come from the same roots, their endless division makes it so that some may not touch each other for decades or even centuries.
Jebrael: Only when the entire tree withers and its trunk decays will those separated branches finally meet in the soil.
Jeht: Speaking of which, why did you choose to leave the desert, father? You rarely mention your past, so I see all this very differently from Tirzad...
Jeht: I don't have family traditions, and I don't even remember my mother's face. I only have you, and you only have me. There is no large tree and no branches that tie us together.
Jeht: You might have left the desert long ago, and this might be my first time seeing it for myself, but I have this feeling that we are like grains of sand here in the desert.
Jeht: No family, no objective... But what we are is pretty free. Haha!
Paimon: Jeht...
Jebrael: The desert holds only the past. It has no future. If what lies beneath the sand and wind can be described as the truth, then I can only say that it perhaps isn't something that will bring joy to everyone.
Jebrael: I gave up the path of seclusion, not because it's a mistaken path, but because I found a better path. Jeht, I hope you'll be able to take that bright path.
Jeht: I don't really understand you. If the path of sand isn't what you desire, then why accept Tirzad's commission? Don't tell me it's because you want to take a look at your past.
Jeht: I think you just can't forget the desert and the hot winds that sweep it.
Jeht: The strange thing is that I have no memories of the desert, but coming here makes me feel like I've returned home all the same.
Jeht: I love the sand, just like I love Paimon and Benben.
Jeht: This is a place with hope too. I'm sure of it. Isn't finding Benben proof of that?
Jeht: Hehe, it'll be a new day tomorrow. The ruins ahead are still waiting to be explored.
Jeht: Keep your chin up, Tirzad! No matter what others say, I think you're a brave person. You've taken that first step and left the comforts of your home.
Jeht: Now, just do as you've already done, and take the second step, then the third...
Jeht: I'm sure you'll get to that place where no one has been, and find that... special research material of yours!
Tirzad: Huh... Even you can occasionally say some nice things, eh, Jeht?
Jeht: Haha! I'm just speaking my mind. After all, I'm as free as the sand.
Jeht: But even the freest sand should rest at an oasis. It's getting late, so let's get some rest.
Jebrael: I'll be on lookout tonight.
Jeht: Heh! I'll sleep well with you on lookout, father.
Black Screen Text: You hear Jebrael softly and casually singing a peaceful tune as you fall asleep. Maybe it's an old local song.
Black Screen Text: O stars high above the wasteland;
O nightingales weary from the day;
It's time to take off the crown of roses;
Cleanse yourself with wine made from grapes.
Sleep, close your eyes;
Yon golden slumber summons thee, wandering sand;
Drink not that bitter salt water;
For the sorrows of tomorrow have gone away.
Tirzad: *sigh* Camping out in the desert is terrible.
Paimon: Oh, c'mon... Why are you being so negative again?
Tirzad: Well, the two of you are adventurers. Let's talk about you instead, Jeht. H—How can a young girl like you endure sleeping on the sand while dressed like that? I just can't figure it out for the life of me.
Jeht: Tirzad, you're such a pampered guy. Tell me, will even a bean placed under ten mattresses disturb your sleep?
Tirzad: Of course not... Anyway, why would anyone sleep on ten mattresses?!
Jeht: Haha! I don't know. Perhaps it might be a hobby of the wealthy, for all you know? But you should have expected that you'd have to camp outside. What else can we do, anyway? Go back the way we came?
Tirzad: Of course not! The material we gathered yesterday isn't enough to write anything good. Forget submitting it to the Akademiya, just reading it at the square would get me ridiculed.
Jeht: Oh! Looks like you've still got some spirit, eh?
Tirzad: O—Of course! This huge ruin is right before me. It must be the Khemenu Temple! As a researcher, I must go in and have a look, right?
Tirzad: And there is... is this...
Paimon: Benben?
Tirzad: Right, Benben... What a strange thing...
Benben: Beep-beep!
Tirzad: Uh, I mean... Such an extraordinary thing might even be closely linked to King Deshret's civilization... If that's true, I can't turn a blind eye to it.
Tirzad: Going back the way we came would be worse than putting a bean beneath my mattress. You may as well have me sleep atop a hundred Benbens! I'd never sleep again!
Paimon: ...A hundred Benbens... Th—That really would hurt.
Tirzad: Anyway, before I collect enough material for my paper... Ahem, I mean, until I figure everything out... I shall not leave.
Tirzad: I've paid all of you very well too, so... If we do encounter danger, I'm counting on you to earn that pay!
Jeht: Hey, come on, aren't we already companions on this journey? Of course we'll protect you in the face of danger — my father and I are professionals.
Paimon: #Yeah! {NICKNAME} is amazing too! You have nothing to worry about!
Tirzad: Who knows what the future holds...
Jebrael: Better to be safe than sorry.
Jeht: Father?
Jebrael: The merchants can rest in the oasis while we're away.
Nachtigal: Gladly.
Jebrael: We've discussed our contingency plans, but we must bury some of our supplies before we leave.
Jebrael: In the worst-case scenario, the merchants may be forced to leave... This way, we'll still have some supplies to come back to even if that happens.
Paimon: Huh? Is that really necessary?
Jebrael: Underestimate the sand and you'll pay with your life.
Jeht: Since it's father, he definitely has his reasons. Well, it's always a good idea to prepare for every possibility.
Black Screen Text: You do as Jebrael says and carefully bury some supplies.
Jeht: This should do, right? Let's set out, then!
Tirzad: S—Slow down... My hangover isn't...
Jeht: Haha! Tirzad, you better hurry up, or someone else might publish a paper about this before you!
Tirzad: ...Don't say things like that!
Paimon: #{NICKNAME}, you ready? Let's go too!

## Talk 5

Jeht: Huh? I thought it would be smooth sailing this time, but we still have to figure out a way to get the door open...
Tirzad: Isn't that good news? At least that means no one's ahead of me. Even if they may have chosen the same subject, I got here first!
Jebrael: The Akademiya's researchers aren't alone in coveting King Deshret's relics.
Tirzad: What do you mean coveting? I'm doing legitimate research, approved by the Akademiya! Don't you dare compare me to Treasure Hoarders!
Traveler: Let's just find a way through the door.
Paimon: #Oh, {NICKNAME}, do you remember how Benben somehow made the stone slate light up?
Paimon: Let's have a look at it. We might even discover a clue!
Jeht: #Huh? What's Tirzad's stone slate doing with {NICKNAME}?
Tirzad: Well...
Jebrael: #{NICKNAME} here's an expert adventurer with much more experience in ruin mechanisms than Tirzad. Giving {M#him}{F#her} this important item will help us make the best use of it.
Tirzad: Ah! Yeah! That's it! That was my intention exactly!
Jeht: Is that how it is? Fine, you do have a point.
Jeht: #So, {NICKNAME}, have you figured anything out?
Traveler: Nothing so far...
Paimon: #Uh... Well, {NICKNAME} does know nothing about research.
Tirzad: It's never too late to learn. You see, despite being well-read, I'm as clueless about this thing as you. I suppose I must continue improving myself.
Traveler: If I spend ten years working hard at the Akademiya...
Tirzad: Ten years of hard work won't do anything for a layman. Just forget it!
Paimon: Huh? But you'll never know if you don't give it a try!
Jeht: Wait, Benben's acting a little strange.
Benben: Beep... Beep...
Jeht: Maybe Benben can open the door?
Benben: Bee-eep. Beep!
Paimon: Whoa! It's actually opening up!
Tirzad: I didn't expect Benben to be able to do that...
Benben: Beep— Beep!
Jeht: Hehe, I think Benben's saying that it's capable of more than that.
Benben: Beep!
Paimon: Paimon gets the feeling that Benben is much more useful than the stone slate... Or maybe we should ask this instead: Will this stone slate really be of any use?
Tirzad: Of course it will! It has to... I might lose my mind if it's of less use than Benben!
Jebrael: Be patient, it's too early to make any judgment yet.
Paimon: ?
Tirzad: Well, you're right, Jebrael! A shortsighted researcher is bound to amount to nothing! Patience is a virtue!
Paimon: #Ugh... But neither Paimon nor {NICKNAME} are researchers...
Traveler: We will need patience nonetheless.
Paimon: Well... That is true...
Jeht: That's enough. It doesn't matter who did it, all that matters is that the door opened, right?
Jeht: Now that the door's open... You're eager to go inside, aren't you, Benben?
Benben: Beep! Bee-eep!
Jeht: Alright! Tirzad Archaeological Team! Let's go!
Benben: Beep-beep!
Jebrael: Let's advance with caution.
Tirzad: #Oh, I know. We should be fine if we stay close to {NICKNAME}, right...?
Paimon: #C'mon, {NICKNAME}, let's get moving!
Traveler: I'm terrible at pursuing and waiting for things...
Tirzad: Haha! But isn't life made up of exactly that?

## Talk 6

Paimon: Hmm, Benben's been milling around the door, but nothing's happening this time.
Benben: Beep... Beep beep...
Jeht: It seemed to have been talking to the doors earlier.
Tirzad: Stop that nonsense! Doors can't speak!
Jeht: But something like Benben shouldn't be able to speak either, right?
Tirzad: Uh...
Paimon: That's true! Huh, guess Paimon's unknowingly accepted that Benben can speak as well... But can beeping really be considered speaking?
Jeht: As long as communication is achieved, it doesn't matter if the language used is something we're familiar with! For example, animals have their own languages, and the sand has its own language too.
Paimon: But if we don't understand it... Paimon's curious! Paimon really wants to know what Benben is saying...
Jeht: Just ask Benben if you're curious! Benben, what were you talking to the door about?
Benben: Beep... Beep-boop, beep, bee-eep! Beep beep... Beep!
Jeht: Oh, I see.
Paimon: Whoa! Jeht, you understand it?
Jeht: Haha! Of course not! It's just as I mentioned before, I can sense some of its emotions.
Jeht: But once you can understand Benben's emotions, trying to guess what Benben's saying isn't that difficult!
Paimon: #Well... To be honest, Paimon didn't sense or understand anything... {NICKNAME}, did you?
Traveler: Just a little.
Paimon: What? Really?
Jeht: Hmm... Well, no one has been here in a very long time.
Tirzad: Oh, of course.
Jeht: Someone has been here, but they weren't able to open this door.
Paimon: Yeah, even Benben can't open it.
Jeht: The door is protecting something very important, and so much time has passed that it has almost forgotten how it used to open.
Jeht: People used to come here, long, long ago, and some would even pass this way many times a day.
Tirzad: I mean, it's such a huge door after all. People used to walk here, huh? Hmm...
Jeht: Oh, it must have been a mischievous cat that no one could catch, which is why so many people passed through here.
Tirzad: Huh? Wait a minute! Did the door tell Benben all of that?
Jeht: Of course not. They're just guesses I made based on Benben's emotions.
Tirzad: You... I—I almost believed you! If I had unknowingly included it in my paper, wouldn't everyone laugh at me once I publish it?
Tirzad: H—How will you make it up to me when that happens?!
Jeht: Hahahaha! Tirzad, that would be your own mistake. As a researcher, you should be able to distinguish the authenticity of the materials you collect!
Tirzad: Ugh!
Paimon: (That was close! Paimon almost believed her too...)
Traveler: (Thank goodness we don't have any papers to write.)
Benben: Beep?
Jebrael: We have a long journey ahead. Let's stop wasting time and get moving.
Tirzad: Right. This place is huge and filled with doors. If we do this in front of every door, who knows how long it'll take us to finish...
Jeht: Wouldn't that be perfect? You aren't fond of camping outside, but this place has walls, a ceiling, and even the research materials you want!
Tirzad: King Deshret's civilization fell due to tyranny, and this place is probably his mausoleum. I'd rather spend two weeks in the desert than spend a single night here!
Jeht: Uh, Tirzad, do you and King Deshret have...
Jebrael: Jeht.
Jeht: Oh, alright! Nachtigal and the others are still waiting for us at the oasis. Let's continue exploring!
Traveler: Not at all.
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon has no idea what Jeht's talking about...

## Talk 7

Jebrael: What is it?
Paimon: It isn't anything important...
Traveler: Whose gravestone is this?
Jebrael: ...
Jebrael: Who knows. Maybe it belongs to a nameless researcher who once tried their luck like Tirzad, but didn't roll high like he did.
Jebrael: King Deshret's secrets rarely reveal themselves to mortals.
Jebrael: Tirzad gave you the stone slate, right?
Paimon: Uh, how did you know?
Jebrael: Keep it safe.
Traveler: Is it important?
Jebrael: You can't be unaware of its value, surely?
Traveler: Well, its value to whom?
Jebrael: ...To our employer, of course. After all, he is depending on it to write his paper.
Jebrael: Anyway, let's head back. We shouldn't keep Jeht and the others waiting for too long.

## Talk 8

Benben: Beep... Bee-eep?

## Talk 9

Tirzad: Ugh, I'm exhausted. Moreover, besides Benben, we haven't made any other discoveries, and that makes my exhaustion all the worse for it.
Paimon: Huh? This place is huge, and we've seen so much on the way here! Paimon's sure there's a lot to write about, right? Even if Paimon doesn't really know much about these things...
Tirzad: Neither of you are a researcher, so of course you don't understand. What we've witnessed this whole time can only be considered as proof for existing research, except Benben...
Tirzad: How should I explain this to a non-researcher...?
Tirzad: Let me put it like this: I want my paper to get approved by the Akademiya's review... It's like love!
Traveler: What does this have to do with love?
Tirzad: Let me explain!
Tirzad: Ahem! A paper must stand out to pass the review. Just imagine that you're pursuing your ideal partner. If you're no different from the other candidates, then how will you capture their heart?
Paimon: This analogy sounds like a real stretch, y'know...
Jeht: The way Tirzad thinks is really strange. In my opinion, a couple just has to consider each other suitable. There's no need to compete with others.
Traveler: We're still talking about academic reviews, aren't we?
Tirzad: Ugh... I shouldn't have made that example. Just forget what I said!
Jebrael: I guess this is where our little chat ends. It'll be more efficient if we split up and look for clues.
Tirzad: An archaeological expedition with no hope in sight. *sigh* Who cares about efficiency?
Jebrael: That stone slate has lit up once. We'll definitely find a way to make it light up completely. We just have to not give up.
Tirzad: But how can you guarantee that? Wait, so you really do know something, don't you?
Jebrael: What I do know is that there may be hope if we continue forward, but we'll leave empty-handed if we turn back now.
Tirzad: Well... That is true.
Jeht: Tirzad, stop worrying about this and that. An Indoorsology researcher like you has finally gotten the opportunity to enter some ruins, so just treat it as a chance to view some of your seniors' research subjects for yourself.
Tirzad: #...You're right. I should be more professional. But even if we're going to split up, I want {NICKNAME} to stay close to me!
Traveler: Okay...
Tirzad: I'll have nothing to worry about with you around.
Jeht: #Haha! There's no danger here! And while you might be a researcher, you're terrible at puzzles. You'll just be a burden to {NICKNAME}.
Tirzad: Exploring ruins has never been my forte! But if I'm given enough time... And pen and paper! Then such problems will be no problem at all!
Jeht: Alright, alright. Anyway, just shout "help meeee!" if you're in danger or something...
Jeht: One of us will get there in time. Probably.
Tirzad: What if none of you do?
Jeht: It's as impossible as breaking open ten bad eggs in a row for breakfast.
Tirzad: I think you need some lessons in mathematics, Jeht... I can introduce a teacher to you once we return.
Traveler: I want to explore freely too, you know...
Tirzad: Then we'll explore freely together!
Traveler: Your lover is academic research?
Tirzad: The current situation is that I want to love it, but it seems to hold no interest toward me.

## Talk 10

Paimon: That's strange! What's a ship doing in here?
Traveler: Might it make sense because this is an "ocean of sand"?
Tirzad: Perhaps a river used to flow through here, but it dried up? Or perhaps... this boat was not made to be used by the living?
Tirzad: I'll have to head back and do some research on the geographical changes here to confirm my theory...

## Talk 11

Jeht: *sigh* Benben seems to have a lot to share with doors. If only my father and I could do the same...

## Talk 12

Jebrael: ...
Jebrael: Have you found any clues? I haven't made any progress over here just yet.

## Talk 13

Tirzad: Great! As expected of my assistant! No mechanism or puzzle shall ever be your match!
Traveler: No need to exaggerate...
Paimon: #{NICKNAME} is impressive, but you should help out too, Tirzad!
Jeht: Speaking of which, didn't you complain about being exhausted and not discovering anything so far? How are you this motivated now?
Tirzad: Ahem! It's because my researcher's intuition tells me that we're about to make a breakthrough!
Paimon: ...Researcher's intuition?
Traveler: Is it like an adventurer's instinct?
Paimon: Oh! Paimon gets it! That's the ability to predict that there will be an ambush at the corner or a trap behind a door, right?
Jeht: #Then you'd better be careful, {NICKNAME}. Father, let's prepare for battle as well.
Tirzad: What are all of you talking about? The researcher's intuition I mentioned is based on vast knowledge and careful observation. It's akin to a flash of genius!
Tirzad: But what you've said does make sense. My consideration is lacking in that aspect. Well, if there's danger... I'll be counting on all of you to do the jobs I hired you for, then.

## Talk 14

Omid: Phew, finally got the chance to put my feet up. I should really plan ahead for my next job now...

## Talk 15

Nachtigal: Let's take this opportunity to inspect our supplies... We've gotta use the Dusk Bird to send Bonifaz a letter and tell him we're safe now.

## Talk 16

Jeht: Father seems a little... Maybe he's recalled his past life in the desert. If only he'd tell us some stories of his past at night.

## Talk 17

Jeht: Is this... a mural?
Tirzad: Whoa! Haha! Bwahahahaha!
Paimon: Hey, Tirzad! Are you alright?
Tirzad: Me? Of course I am. I'm terrific! I've never felt better!
Tirzad: #Since Paimon and {NICKNAME} aren't from around here, it's understandable that you don't recognize its worth.
Tirzad: As for Jebrael and Jeht, uh... I guess it's a knowledge issue? No, it isn't something you should have knowledge about.
Tirzad: Paimon, let me test you for a moment. What can you discern from this mural?
Paimon: Uh, there are many people? And... and something like a sun and an eye...?
Tirzad: *sigh* I guess Paimon has no talent for this.
Paimon: Why did you even ask if you already knew that, huh!?
Tirzad: #And what about you, {NICKNAME}? What do you see in this mural?
Traveler: Hmm... It's a very symmetrical painting?
Tirzad: It is symmetrical... But this isn't a matter of style alone. It symbolizes a solid structure, a rule by force.
Tirzad: The sun and the eye symbolize King Deshret. Beneath him are the "seven pillars," so we call them, that hold up King Deshret's pyramid of authority.
Tirzad: As for his subjects... They are insignificant. They dare not express any complaint. They are forced to submit.
Tirzad: But even so, they couldn't escape destruction...
Paimon: Hmm... Is that really the case?
Tirzad: Come now, how can I be wrong? The theme of this mural fully conforms to the depictions of King Deshret in everything I've ever read.
Tirzad: A terrifying king who used absolute and supreme authority to keep all his subjects beneath him.
Jeht: Hmm... But this mural feels so peaceful to me. Everything feels so orderly, and everyone has their own place and duty. Isn't that good?
Tirzad: What? What kind of crooked interpretation is that?
Tirzad: ...Jeht, you can make up stories about Benben talking to doors, but deciphering murals and the history of King Deshret's civilization is my area of expertise.
Jeht: But...
Tirzad: Now, I won't hear any buts. Everything I have said has been proven by prior research... and this mural will become part of Vahumana too.
Tirzad: Of course, I'll be the one to write it.
Jebrael: Jeht isn't entirely correct, but you... You know very little about the sand.
Tirzad: #Ha! You've hardly said more than a few words all this time, yet you're standing up for your daughter now? I may not be a match for you in a battle of strength, but I have {NICKNAME} by my side!
Tirzad: #{NICKNAME}, you'll take my side, won't you?
Traveler: Uh...
Paimon: That's not appropriate! We're all traveling together... No, we're all companions on this expedition. Even if our opinions differ, we shouldn't fight over it, right?
Tirzad: What? Together? I started this expedition, and I paid for it. All of you are employed by me.
Tirzad: Moreover, I'm the only one with formal academic training. A layman has no right to speak on academic issues!
Jebrael: ...One who only draws from others can hardly call himself an independent researcher.
Tirzad: Oh? Then let's hear your "unique" insights.
Jebrael: This destroyed kingdom was once strong and beautiful. It may be difficult to believe... that all of this was built in the desert.
Jebrael: And you only see the obedience revealed on the surface, but fail to notice the direction of the people's hopes.
Jebrael: It was their hope which tied the people of the sand to King Deshret. They thought this would help them overcome the calamity, but we know the outcome of that.
Tirzad: Heh, even delusions should have limits. Are you trying to overturn all prior research? I don't think there's sufficient evidence for any of this nonsense.
Jebrael: Well, what a coincidence. I, too, do not think that the opinion of a struggling researcher who came here out of desperation holds any weight.
Tirzad: Y—You...
Tirzad: I never knew you had such a sharp tongue...
Jeht: Father...
Traveler: Arguing won't change a thing.
Paimon: Exactly! Paimon can't figure out what you're arguing about, but if it's academic, there's always room for discussion, right? So, put your differences aside for now...
Traveler: You can't convince each other anyway.
Paimon: Yeah, so let's continue our investigation! Perhaps... Uh, perhaps we'll discover more clues, then we can see who is right and who is wrong, alright?
Tirzad: Ugh! This is infuriating! I shouldn't have discussed academics with a layman!
Paimon: Whoa! What's going on?!
Tirzad: Whatever it is, it isn't my fault!
Traveler: This path looks like it leads upward.
Jebrael: I don't see any traps.
Paimon: Paimon wonders where it leads... But staying here won't change anything either, so let's continue, shall we?
Traveler: Insignificant subjects and a great king.
Tirzad: Exactly! That's exactly what this mural symbolizes!

## Talk 18

Tirzad: I wonder if a paper can be written from Benben and Jeht's interactions... But which field would it belong to?

## Talk 19

Tirzad: There still hasn't been anything worth writing about... Would Benben come if I tried to take it back with me?
Traveler: I think it would rather stay here.
Tirzad: Hey, now you're acting just like Jeht. That thing... Ahem, I mean Benben, can only prove its true worth when it becomes research material for me.
Traveler: Wouldn't you have to change your research topic?
Tirzad: Oh, right! It was the clues on the Stone Slate that led me here. How did I stray so far off my plan?

## Talk 20

Jeht: Benben seems to know this place well, and for some reason, "doors" seem to hold a special place in its heart?
Traveler: Maybe it's a bizarrely-shaped key?
Jeht: But if that's true, then which door is its pair?
Benben: Beep?
Traveler: Benben has three corners, and so do the doors here...
Jeht: #So Benben's the type that's drawn to something similar to itself, huh? {NICKNAME}, no wonder they say you're an experienced adventurer — you observe everything in such detail.
Benben: Beep. Bee-eep!
