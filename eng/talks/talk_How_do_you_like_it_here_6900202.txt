Traveler: How do you like it here?
Kamisato Ayaka: Haha, you've no need to worry.
Kamisato Ayaka: The sights here are nothing like what I've seen at home. There are new wonders to be found with each step.
Kamisato Ayaka: But there's also an added layer of significance to it, because this place belongs to you.
Traveler: Make yourself at home. I mean it quite literally, haha.
Kamisato Ayaka: Oh...
Kamisato Ayaka: That would be too unseemly...
Kamisato Ayaka: However, I appreciate your kindness.
Traveler: It's my pleasure.
Kamisato Ayaka: Ahaha... That's very considerate of you. However, you don't have to go above and beyond for me.
Kamisato Ayaka: Please let me know if you ever need my assistance. I hope I can be of some help to you too.
Traveler: I hope that it's a place where you can let go of your worries and just relax.
Kamisato Ayaka: Hm... I appreciate your kindness.
Kamisato Ayaka: I wouldn't dare "let go" and "relax." However, I am more than grateful for being able to rest here for a while.
