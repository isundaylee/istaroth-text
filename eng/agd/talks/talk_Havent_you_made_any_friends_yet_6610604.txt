Traveler: Haven't you made any friends yet?
Pacha: Haha, it's not that easy!
Pacha: I did come across some of the Flower-Feather Clan's warriors on the battlefield, but that was hardly the time for a chit-chat.
Pacha: Those Qucusaurs flew up so high! If the Flower-Feather Clan hadn't done such a good job saving people left, right, and center, there might have been even more casualties.
Pacha: I don't think I'd be able to fight alongside them... not with my abilities, at least. Perhaps the most experienced hunters could jump as high as they can.
Pacha: But with greater abilities comes greater risk too... I still haven't heard any news of Sinchi since the war ended...
