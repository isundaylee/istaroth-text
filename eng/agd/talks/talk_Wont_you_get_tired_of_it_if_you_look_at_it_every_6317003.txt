Traveler: Won't you get tired of it if you look at it every day?
Yasuda: *sigh* This is the part that young people like you wouldn't understand. Though the scenery around here never changes, the people and the things related to it do. It's very interesting if you pay attention to those changes.
Yasuda: I once met a young man wearing a maple-red shirt who had the ability to read the weather. The clothes that I hung out to dry would've gotten wet if he hadn't told me about the rain.
Yasuda: And if you think about it, if I wasn't out and about like this, I wouldn't have met an outstanding outlander like yourself either. Am I right? Haha!
