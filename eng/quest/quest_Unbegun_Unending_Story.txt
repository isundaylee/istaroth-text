# Unbegun, Unending Story

Paimon: Huh. What's a place like this doing in a library? Could this be the Restricted Section Lisa mentioned?
Paimon: Hmm, doesn't quite feel like it, though...
Paimon: ...You don't think this place is hiding some terrible secret, do you? Like those rooms you always hear about in scary stories? Y'know, the ones that are usually totally off limits?
Traveler: Surely it would be locked if that were the case.
Paimon: That's true... We just kinda waltzed in here. And it didn't seem like the lock had been broken or anything...
Paimon: Wait, hang on a minute! This isn't the door we came in through! Are we even in the library anymore?
Traveler: We could be underneath Cider Lake?
Paimon: You think? Wow. That's pretty impressive, building all this under the lake... Wait, no, that's ridiculous! No way is that where we are.
Paimon: Hmm... Too bad Lisa's not working today, otherwise we could ask her... Well, we're here anyhow, and this place doesn't look too dangerous. Why don't we take a look around?
Paimon: New places are meant for exploring, after all! You've gotta try all kinds of new things to become a good and experienced guide.
Paimon: Ooh, look, a stuffed wolf toy! So cute!
Paimon: It's so fluffy and soft! Huh, wonder who left it here...
Traveler: For all you know, that toy might be this room's real master.
Paimon: "Awoooo! Foolish Traveler! You dare enter this fortress of doom without invitation! Prepare to be eaten alive!"
Paimon: ...We should probably just leave it here for now. This place is huge, so let's keep on exploring!
Traveler: Or it might be the guardian of this mysterious room.
Paimon: What sorta guardian would be dozing away on the sofa like this?
Paimon: "*snore* No danger in sight... Saw nothing, means nothing happened... *snore*"
Traveler: Perhaps we've reached another world...
Paimon: And what world would that be, huh?
