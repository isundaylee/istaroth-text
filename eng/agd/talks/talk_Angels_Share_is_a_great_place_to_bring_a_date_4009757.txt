Patton: Angel's Share is a great place to bring a date!
Patton: There's no need to trek all the way up to Starsnatch Cliff, nor is there a point in climbing the heights of Cape Oath. All you need to do is walk into a tavern, order two drinks, and chat the day away with your companions!
Patton: Apple cider, cherry cider... and delicious Dandelion Wine. If you want it, the Angel's Share's got it.
Patton: This is, after all, an industry thriving beneath the gaze of our esteemed Master Diluc. All beverages are supplied straight from the Dawn Winery.
Patton: So, how about it? Want to come in?
