## Talk 1

Crestfallen Citizen: Don't worry about me. I just need a bit of time to get my feelings under control again.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Well, that's settled, then. We should go report back to Vile.

## Talk 3

Vile: How goes the matter of the Treasure Hoarders?
Traveler: They won't be giving us any trouble.
Vile: Ah, as expected of the Honorary Knight. Well done. You did well chatting that Treasure Hoarder up previously as well... as expected of the one that gentleman has his eye on.
Traveler: Excuse me, have you been watching us this whole time?
Vile: Why, of course! How else was I going to call the Knights over in the nick of time, hmm?
Vile: All in all, thank you for your help. Please take these, and don't be shy about it. These are funds that our dear gentleman set aside for me to use.
Vile: I'll see you around, then. Have a nice day.

## Talk 4

Suspicious Citizen: Wonderful, this place is positively bustling!
Traveler: When the wind blows the flowers about...
Suspicious Citizen: Oh? Hmm... that's when bystanders should watch out.
Suspicious Citizen: Ah, so you're one of ours. You're just in time: I've got my eyes on a pair of careless little lovebirds. What say we go get us some Mora, eh?
Suspicious Citizen: You attract their attention, I'll cut their purses. Once we've got 'em, let's head back to Windrise to meet up with the rest. Wonder how they're doing...
Traveler: Oh, sure. You're just going to have to go on a little trip with me first.
Suspicious Citizen: Eh!? Wait, you ain't a Treasure Hoarder. Who are you?
Traveler: Just a friendly neighborhood Knight.
Paimon: Well, guess that's one guy in Knight custody. But Paimon wonders how they got here so fast...
Paimon: Well, guess that's not too important. Didn't he say that they were going to meet up at Windrise? Let's go check it out.

## Talk 5

Restless Citizen: Eh? What is it?
Traveler: When the wind blows the flowers about...
Restless Citizen: Wind? Flowers? You mean the Dandelions?
Restless Citizen: What about that? It's totally normal.
Paimon: Um, it's nothing. Sorry for disturbing you...
Paimon: Well, that seems to have been an ordinary citizen. Let's go ask someone else.

## Talk 6

Crestfallen Citizen: I wonder if I still have a chance...
Crestfallen Citizen: Hmm? Is something the matter?
Traveler: When the wind blows the flowers about...
Crestfallen Citizen: Well, yes, that's this time of the year for sure. I know, I know, I should be enjoying it.
Crestfallen Citizen: Actually, that's true. Why should I be so down just because I got rejected? This festival isn't over yet.
Crestfallen Citizen: Thanks for your encouragement. I'll pick myself back up for sure!
Paimon: Looks like that person misunderstood. Well, at least they're not someone suspicious...

## Talk 7

Vile: Well, Honorary Knight, the duty of sharing the Knights' burden falls to you.
