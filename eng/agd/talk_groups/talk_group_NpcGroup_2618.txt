Khedive: #Oh? Why, hello there! I thought you'd left, Traveler.
Khedive: The energy readings around here have stabilized a great deal, thanks to you. When I go back and write my thesis, I will mention you for sure.
Khedive: However, as the nominal employer of the exploration team, I will still need to stay for a long time to observe this place.

Traveler: I've got to go.
Khedive: Then I shan't keep you. Just know that you'll always be welcome with the exploration team!

Traveler: So, how's your research going?
Khedive: Since you've helped me so much so far, I could tell you a few things, no problem.
Khedive: We came here to monitor the anomalous energies that have been radiating from deep below and study the effects they are having on The Chasm.
Khedive: It seems clear now, though, that the situation we face is far more complex than we first imagined.
Khedive: If it wasn't for your valor, I doubt that we'd have gotten anywhere near as much data as we have.

Khedive: How's Zhiqiong...
Khedive: Zhiqiong's condition has worsened. What on earth is she being so stubborn about, honestly...
Khedive: I gave her some medicine. It should be able to at least slow some of the more serious symptoms, so her situation is stabilizing...
Khedive: I'm no adventurer, and I can't claim to understand their desires, but I have no wish to watch someone else suffer before my eyes like this...
Khedive: *sigh* Forget it. I hope she's more amenable to your logic.

Khedive: #Hello, Traveler! It's great to see you here.
Traveler: What are you doing here?
Khedive: A field study, to record and research ancient life forms and their remains. Well, and I'm also here to observe the abnormalities in the geological layers.
Paimon: And you're not going down there yourself?
Khedive: Me? Go down there? No, of course not.
Khedive: I mean, I did pay for this exploration team to be set up. I'll fork out the Mora, you do the work. My research gets done, you get paid. I'm happy, you're happy. See?
Khedive: That's how that works.
Paimon: ...This guy is really annoying.
Traveler: Bye.
Khedive: Well, don't let me keep you too long.

Khedive: What a curious geological environment we're in now! I'm sure I can outdo the research goals set by the Akademiya this year.
Khedive: Oh, Traveler, what's up?

Traveler: Nothing...
