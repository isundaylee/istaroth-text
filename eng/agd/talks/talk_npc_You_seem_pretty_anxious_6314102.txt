Traveler: You seem pretty anxious.
Nami: Uh... Ahaha, is it really that obvious...
Nami: Actually, I've always been the nervous sort. Maybe it's because I've always had sharp eyes. The more you can see, the more pressure you feel, you know?
Nami: I can see a long way out from here. The last time I looked out from here to the sea, I saw an outlander vessel with people on it dressed all fancy. They had masks, too.
Nami: ...Were they the Fatui? I have to be more careful. We can't let them reach the shore willy-nilly.
