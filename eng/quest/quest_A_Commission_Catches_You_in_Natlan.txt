# A Commission Catches You in Natlan


## Talk 1

Paimon: Huh? What are the Fatui doing here?
Paimon: That's a little concerning... Let's go over there and see what they're up to.
Paimon: Also, how did they get this close to a tribal settlement?
Traveler: Well, considering what The Captain did for Natlan...
Paimon: Huh... All the Fatui left in Natlan are probably The Captain's subordinates. That basically makes them followers of one of Natlan's heroes.
Paimon: Still, once a Fatuus always a Fatuus. Something seems off, seeing them here... Let's go check it out!
Traveler: Maybe they've been given a bit more leeway.

## Talk 2

Paimon: Ahem! What are you guys doing here?
Grudoc (???): Heh, following orders. If you have a problem, take it up with our employer.
Paimon: Hey, what's with the attitude? Can the Fatui even work for a private employer?
Montluson (???): Ahem! This is Grudoc — I hired him to be my bodyguard in Natlan. As you can see, he's not the sociable type. I'm sorry for any offense.
Montluson (???): My original plan was to hire someone from the local tribes, but a priest recommended Grudoc and his squad.
Montluson (???): I was told they were capable fighters and had the time to spare, so they fit the bill... It seems like the Fatui's reputation in Natlan is quite positive.
Paimon: So, that's what happened... Then, you must be from Fontaine?
Montluson: #Precisely! Montluson, at your service. I work in the publication business. And you two... Wait, you must be Traveler and his fairy companion!
Paimon: Oh, you know us?
Montluson: A golden-haired Traveler with a floating companion... There's no mistake!
Montluson: Your exploits in Fontaine have all the makings of a best-selling series! I'd be a failure of a book merchant if I couldn't recognize you.
Paimon: #Wow, we're really famous at this point, Traveler!
Montluson: It's truly my lucky day! I know this is sudden, but I was actually looking for you two... You see, I have a favor to ask.
Paimon: So, you... chased us all the way to Natlan? That's a little creepy...
Montluson: You'll be generously rewarded, I promise you!
Paimon: ...Well, at least he got straight to the point. Should we hear what he has to say?
Traveler: Something tells me we can't escape this one.
Paimon: *ahem*... Alright, we'll hear your request.
Montluson: You know the great shaman, Citlali, right? I need her help with something!
Paimon: Uh... Yeah, but the chances of her helping a random stranger just because we asked...
Traveler: With her personality? Pretty slim...
Paimon: Yeah, Citlali really doesn't like dealing with strangers...
Montluson: I heard about that from other members of her tribe. But, they told me if one person could convince her, it would be the golden-haired Traveler.
Montluson: If you manage it, I'll even double your pay!
Paimon: ...
Traveler: Why do you need her help?
Paimon: Oh, yeah... We should definitely get to the bottom of that first.
Montluson: It's kind of a long story, and there's tribal history involved, so you should hear it from an expert. Allier, if you could...
Allier: Of course! I don't often have an eager audience for this kind of thing... Nice to meet you. The name's Allier — I'm a Researcher from the Fontaine Research Institute.
Allier: Unlike most researchers, I have a keen interest in ancient ruins. That's why I was invited to join Monsieur Montluson's team.
Allier: Have you heard the legend of the great shaman, Huitzilin?
Traveler: It sounds familiar...
Allier: Yes. According to local records, she was a color mystic who lived over two hundred years ago, the most adept in her tribe at using that particular technique.
Allier: Out of all her exploits, her most celebrated is "the Battle of Seven Colors."
Allier: According to legend, the battle was triggered by an Abyss invasion, one of the most brutal in Natlan's history, even from a greater historical perspective.
Allier: Amazingly, Natlan was able to turn the tide despite being at an extreme disadvantage. The key to victory was none other than a "color" Huitzilin created on the battlefield.
Allier: The "color" was extraordinary — illusory in appearance while also seeming to possess physical form. Legend has it that Huitzilin used the "color" to construct a magnificent maze on the battlefield...
Allier: ...And trap all the enemies inside. This allowed her allies to launch a counterattack and, ultimately, secure victory.
Montluson: *ahem*... Anyway, that's the gist of it. We don't want to take up too much of your time.
Montluson: That story is the reason I came to Natlan. I often publish books about the history of other nations. They always end up faring well on the market.
Montluson: When I heard this story for the first time, I wanted to include it in my next collection, but...
Montluson: Historical records about Natlan aren't very detailed. We haven't been able to determine where the battle took place, or find any definitive evidence that it occurred at all.
Montluson: Even within the Masters of the Night-Wind, people dispute the legitimacy of the story. Some believe it to be a myth.
Montluson: If that were the case, the story would not be fit for publication...
Paimon: Uh, but, if you're just including it in a story collection, why does it matter if it never happened?
Montluson: Well, you see, the slogan for the collection is "restoring the truth of history." Naturally, I need it to be factual.
Montluson: That's why I'm here. The Masters of the Night-Wind are said to have a tradition of recording past events, so I wanted to consult their records.
Montluson: But, I was refused access to the Obsidian Altar. Application after application, and all I received were a few ordinary woven scrolls with nothing to offer. Honestly, I'm just trying to promote their history, and they make such a fuss...
Allier: According to my research, their scrolls are considered sacred relics in addition to historical records. Naturally, outsiders are rarely granted access.
Allier: Not to mention, the scrolls we did get to review actually contain a huge amount of information. I just need more time, and I could—
Montluson: We've been over this, Allier. There's no need to waste time on those scrolls when we have a better way.
Paimon: Citlali, you mean?
Montluson: Exactly. You're well aware, I'm sure, that Citlali has been alive for more than two hundred years. That means she lived during the era of the Battle of Seven Colors!
Montluson: If she agrees to be my consultant, then no other historical records are necessary.
Paimon: Oh, that's what you want...
Montluson: So, what do you say? I'll quadruple the pay if it helps sweeten the deal!
Paimon: Well, it's not that we don't want to help you...
Traveler: We actually should go ask her, Paimon.
Paimon: Oh, right! The duty the chief gave us has a lot to do with Huitzilin...
Paimon: Who knows? The "Battle of Seven Colors" might lead us in the right direction!
Paimon: Alright, we'll help you convince Citlali. Just let us do the talking, okay?
Montluson: Of course!
Traveler: We still have a duty to fulfill, after all.
Traveler: She's the one that worked with colors, right?
Traveler: And if the pay is good...

## Talk 3

Montluson: So, this is where the great shaman lives? A bit... far from civilization, isn't it? I hope the person who pointed us in this direction wasn't mistaken...
Paimon: For someone like Citlali, it actually makes a lot of sense.
Allier: Is this graffiti her work, too? I wonder if it's a cultural practice... If I could just copy it down—
Montluson: We're here for a reason, Allier. As agreed, you two can do the talking, and we'll wait for you here.
Paimon: Okay, we'll go knock on the door! Hopefully she's not hungover...
Paimon: Citlali? Are you there? We need your help with something!
Paimon: ...No response. Maybe she's not home?
Traveler: Let's try her other name.
Paimon: Oh, uh... Granny Itztli? Are you home?
Black Screen Text: The door is thrown open, and you're met with the pungent smell of alcohol.
Citlali: Hey, kid! If you're here to challenge me, book an appointment first!
Traveler: (So, Citlali's a real hermit, huh...)
Citlali: #...Traveler!
Black Screen Text: The door closes abruptly.
Paimon: ...Looks like we came at a bad time.
Citlali: *ahem*! Are you still there? Just come in, we can talk inside.
Paimon: Well, at least we didn't get turned away...

## Talk 4

Paimon: Huh, so this is where Citlali lives...
Citlali: I, uh, didn't have time to fully clean up the place... Complain if you want. Menial housework means nothing to a great shaman like myself.
Citlali: Besides, in light novels, people who keep everything neat and tidy are always too boring to be the protagonists.
Citlali: Also, I'm not a hermit. I'm just above superficial rules of societal etiquette.
Paimon: She sure does care a lot about what we think of her...
Citlali: Oh, and that spell I used to transfer my senses to you... You're not still, uh, experiencing the side-effects, are you?
Citlali: It's my duty as a great shaman to check that kind of thing.
Paimon: Oh, you mean when we could hear your thoughts? Nope! It's been so long. We don't have to worry about that anymore, right?
Citlali: #Then, why do I hear Traveler's thoughts in my head?
Paimon: What?
Traveler: (Oh, she heard me call her a hermit... That bothers her? I thought she was "above superficial rules of societal etiquette"...)
Citlali: I can still hear you, y'know!
Traveler: I apologize for offending you...
Citlali: Don't bother, I'll find a way to fix it. First you hear my thoughts, now I'm hearing your thoughts...
Citlali: It was just a simple spell. I use it on you, and now it's on the fritz...
Citlali: Forget it. Just tell me why you're here.
Paimon: Well, someone asked us... to ask you... to be their consultant. They have questions about the history of Natlan.
Citlali: So, they asked the hero of Natlan to put in a good word? Sounds like they know I don't usually trouble myself with other people's problems.
Paimon: The pay is really good!
Citlali: Doesn't matter. I'm busy.
Paimon: She sure doesn't look busy... Paimon knew this wouldn't get us anywhere...
Traveler: What if the request comes from me?
Citlali: From you...
Paimon: Yeah, we were given a sacred duty to help your tribe weave a special scroll!
Citlali: Huh? So, you're the appointed ones this time?
Paimon: We were surprised, too! After all, we have no idea how to weave a scroll like that.
Paimon: But, with Chief Biram's help, we were able to make some progress!
Paimon: We still haven't succeeded, but we learned that the key to weaving the scroll is a special kind of color.
Paimon: The historical event those men want to ask about also involves color. If you help them, you might end up helping us, too!
Citlali: ...
Paimon: She's giving us that face again... Did Paimon not explain things clearly?
Citlali: I can't decide whether this twist is completely out of the blue, or if it was foreshadowed all along...
Paimon: Um... Does that mean you won't help us?
Citlali: I... I need to think about it.
Paimon: Then, there's still hope!
Grudoc: Hey! What's the hold-up? Just give us an answer already!
Paimon: Y—You agreed to let us do the talking!
Citlali: Ugh...
Paimon: Citlali...

## Talk 5

Montluson: Stand down, Grudoc! As your employer, if I tell you to wait, then you wait.
Grudoc: Understood.
Montluson: You're the great shaman who's been alive for centuries? But you're so... Ahem, apologies for the disturbance. Grudoc is a recent hire — so difficult to restrain sometimes.
Paimon: Phew... You're lucky you didn't force Citlali's hand.
Montluson: Well, since you're here, how about a discussion...?
Citlali: Do you have any idea who I am? Did you think Granny Itztli would be fooled by your little performance?
Montluson: Um...
Citlali: I have no intention of speaking to you. Your "recent hire" interrupted me right as I was about to make an important decision.
Citlali: Pull a trick like that again, and I'll make your lives a living horror novel, except ten times worse. That's all I came out here to say.
Paimon: Whoa...
Citlali: #Traveler, we have a discussion to finish.
Montluson: You live up to your name, Granny Itztli. I apologize for the offence. I'm just surprised the Battle of Seven Colors didn't pique your interest...
Citlali: You're investigating the Battle of Seven Colors?
Montluson: #Ah, Traveler didn't get to that part?
Montluson: #Yes, I thought Traveler could help me convince you. But, if I'm not mistaken, you have a personal interest in this matter, don't you?
Montluson: I heard that the great shaman, Huitzilin, was a friend of yours. You two must have been close...
Montluson: If I can resolve the controversy and prove the Battle took place, I'll include it in my next collection. Then, all of Teyvat will learn the truth.
Montluson: With your support, your friend's heroic deeds will once again be known throughout the land... Inspiring, don't you think?
Traveler: You'll be helping me fulfill my duty.
Citlali: If this is really about that duty, then... Fine, I'll help you.
Montluson: I'm honored—
Citlali: #Save it — I agreed to help Traveler, not you. You'll just have to leech what you can.
Paimon: Well, at least she agreed to help...
Traveler: (Looks like my friendship with Citlali came in handy after all. I never took her to be the heartless type, anyway.)
Citlali: Who are you calling heartless?
Montluson: #Not a problem! I always planned to work with Traveler.
Montluson: So, did you directly experience any events of the Battle? Do you have any idea where it took place? Can you think of any relics we could use to prove it?
Citlali: Talk at me why don't you...
Montluson: Um...
Traveler: I'd like to know, too.
Citlali: Fine — no, no, and no.
Montluson: Uh...
Citlali: I did live during the same era as her, but that doesn't mean we experienced the same events. I've lived a long time, but I'm not a walking encyclopedia.
Citlali: You decide the angle of your investigation, and I'll provide answers if I'm familiar with the subject.
Montluson: ...Alright. Even if you didn't witness the battle yourself, you still lived through that era. Your insights are very valuable!
Montluson: Allier, you had an idea about where to start, yes?
Allier: Oh, well, my plan was to consult the members of the tribe in charge of recording history.
Montluson: Then, let's start there.
Montluson: #Traveler, what do you say to officially working together? After all, it appears I can only get Miss Citlali's help through you.
Traveler: Sounds good.
Traveler: And it would mean a lot to your tribe.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*

Allier: A great shaman who has lived for hundreds of years... If she agrees to help us, there are so many things we could research!
Montluson: Allier, as the provider of your research funding, I suggest you focus on our current mission. It's very important to me.
Allier: Sorry. Maybe, if we get a chance in the future, then...
Montluson: We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
