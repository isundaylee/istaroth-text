# Orobashi's Legacy: Part I


## Talk 1

Place: It seems that two critical components are missing from the ward.
Traveler: Submit Item

## Talk 2

Kaji: How're things going? Have you finished repairing the wards already?
Traveler: Not yet.
Kaji: It's fine. Take your time.
Traveler: I'm still working on it.
Kaji: And if you don't manage it, just leave it. The most important thing is that you shouldn't stay in this place too long â€” it's dangerous.

## Additional Conversations

*Conversations not present as sub-quests.*


### Additional Talk 1

Observe: The strangely-shaped stone lantern seems to be emitting an ominous energy.
Paimon: This stone lantern is so strange... It's so creepy.
Paimon: Oh, what's that written on the light post?
Observe: "Travelers passing through: if you have any questions about this ward, please go to the Musoujin Gorge and talk to Mr. Kaji about it."
Observe: The handwriting looks very recent, and there are a few lines of smaller handwriting below, which have been eroded by the rain:
Observe: "Please tell Mr. Kaji we've tried... But unfortunately... Maybe he can find it somewhere nearby..."
Observe: "Please tell Mr. Kaji to come to the refuge as soon as possible. He's dearly missed by his family."
Paimon: This Mr. Kaji seems to be pretty concerned about these stone lanterns. Why don't we go to Musoujin Gorge and ask him?

### Additional Talk 2

Touch Ward: You gaze at the ward, and suddenly, a strange energy flows towards you.
Touch Ward: You realize that it is not resisting you, but is asking you for something...
Paimon: Something seems to be missing from this ward. Best to look around the area for the missing parts.
Paimon: Use your Elemental Sight to scan for scattered traces of elements nearby. Maybe you'll find something!

### Additional Talk 3

Touch Ward: The lantern has finally been repaired. The weather seems to have changed as well.

### Additional Talk 4

Kaji: Not bad, outlander! The clouds are almost gone. It seems as though my guess was right.
Kaji: Next, the two wards at the Serpent's Head and Jakotsu Mine still need to be repaired.
Kaji: If you don't mind, I'll leave those two wards to you, too.
Traveler: You got it!
Kaji: Thank you very much for your help. Although I am by no means a man of wealth, I promise that you will be paid fairly.
Kaji: I still don't know when it'll happen, but it seems that the time for my reunion with family and friends is drawing a little closer...
Kaji: By the way, you can find me on the west side of the island once you're done. Fort Mumei came under rebel assault previously, and I suspect that the attack is related to these changes.
