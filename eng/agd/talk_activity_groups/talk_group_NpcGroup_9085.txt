Freminet: I'm here.

Traveler: How do you like it here?
Freminet: Mhm.
Freminet: ...
Freminet: I mean, uh... Everything here is really nice. And I'm used to it now, so there's no need to worry about me.
Traveler: It's okay. You don't have to be so polite.
Freminet: Sorry...
Freminet: I'm just worried that if I just say everything on my mind, I might cause unnecessary misunderstandings.
Freminet: ...
Freminet: ...Alright, then in that case, I'll do as you ask...
Freminet: To tell you the truth, I—I'm actually a little homesick.
Freminet: Even though this place is really comfortable, and the environment here is flawless, I just... can't seem to get used to life here.
Freminet: This is nobody's problem but my own, so... Please don't think I'm upset with you, or unsatisfied about anything in this place.
Freminet: ...I hope you can forgive me.
Traveler: You can tell me how you really feel.
Freminet: Heh... Are you really sure about that?

## Talk

Traveler: Would you like to chat?
Freminet: Mhm... Please go ahead.
Traveler: Why don't we talk about Pers?
Freminet: ...Ah, thank you for remembering its name.
Traveler: Is there a story behind Pers's name?
Freminet: To explain it... I'll need to tell you a really, really old story I once read in a picture book.
Traveler: Ooh, I'm listening!
Freminet: Mhm... So once upon a time, in a faraway seaside town, there lived a black and white bird.
Freminet: Since birth, it spoke with a stutter, walked with a wobble, and was unable to fly, so it was always bullied by the other birds.
Freminet: Until one day, greedy pirates stole a jewel-studded diadem from the underwater palace...
Freminet: In a flash, lightning and thunder engulfed the sea, and a tsunami rose from the depths, threatening to wipe out the entire town...
Freminet: The black-and-white bird tried to leap upwards, but it still couldn't fly... In its recklessness, it crashed against the mast and sank into the ocean alongside the wrecked ship.
Freminet: The seabirds flying overhead thought it would drown right then and there, but to their surprise, it began to swim like the swiftest of fish!
Freminet: It swam and swam, until its strength finally gave out. It restored the diadem to its rightful place underwater, and immediately, the storms died down, and it was as if nothing bad had ever happened.
Freminet: As you've probably guessed by now... The bird in the story was named Pers. It was a penguin that came to town by accident.
Traveler: What a wonderful story.
Freminet: I've always admired the Pers in the story, but after reading it, what struck me the most was... its loneliness.
Freminet: So, I decided to stick close and hug Pers, so we can keep each other warm...
Traveler: Ah, I didn't know you were friends with a hero!
Freminet: ...Heh, you're right.
Traveler: Why does Pers look the way it does?

## Talk

Traveler: Anything you'd like to do?
Freminet: Hmm... Could I trouble you to accompany me to a few places when you're free?
Freminet: I'd like to visit Lepaute Horlogerie, Beaumont Workshop, and the Vasari Passage.
Traveler: Sure thing.
Freminet: Mhm... I'd like to take a look at their clockwork crafts, as well as the variety of small mechanisms they usually have to offer.
Freminet: I'm a regular of Leschots', but whenever I pass by the other shops, I can't help but be curious...
Freminet: What lies hidden deep within those shops? What if there's something there that's both original and exquisitely designed?
Freminet: What I wouldn't give to be able to see everything for myself! If only... *sigh*
Freminet: See, I'm... not very good at dealing with people, and if I spent a lot of time gawking at the wares without paying a single coin, I'm sure the shopkeepers would get mad at me.
Freminet: So, if you could step in at that point, and help me...
Traveler: Explain on your behalf?
Freminet: Yeah... Something like that. I know it might be awkward, but...
Freminet: I'll pay you back, I swear! As long as it's something I can do...
Traveler: No problem.
Freminet: Ahh, thank you so much! I'm... not dreaming, am I?
Traveler: Pay for the wares?
Freminet: Eh!? No, no, of course not! That's not what I meant at all...
Freminet: Just a few words of explanation... should be enough.
Traveler: Is there anything in particular you're interested in?

Freminet: Good morning.
Freminet: I'm... just going to stay here if you don't have any special assignments.

Freminet: #Good night, Traveler.
Freminet: "May your dreams be as dazzling as the starry night above the ocean, and your dreamless nights be naught but filled with serene respite."

Freminet: These buildings and those spherical lamps — they use this style in Merusea Village, don't they? I recognize them from a picture album.
Freminet: Legends say that the home of the Melusines is a secluded little village deep under the water, far away from the rest of the world — the kind of village you read about in fairytales. But I've always believed it's real.
Freminet: Um... But please don't tell anyone else I said that. Most people would probably think I'm just being childish...

## Talk

Freminet: With storage heaters like this, adding an extra layer of heating elements makes them more durable than is usually advertized.
Freminet: And the motor in this kind of fan is always running at critical velocity, which poses a safety issue...
Freminet: ...Sorry! I tend to get carried away when I start talking about this kind of stuff. Um, with your permission, though, I could definitely tweak them so they run a lot better! At least, I—I think I could...
