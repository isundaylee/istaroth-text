## Talk

Cip: Hello there... Sorry, I was just meditating. Did I miss anything?

## Talk

Traveler: About my reputation with the Masters of the Night-Wind...
Cip: Ah yes. Thank you for your assistance. May you never be lost amidst the mists.

## Talk

Traveler: Hello. What is this place?
Cip: Ah, this is an Obsidian Totem Pole. Obsidian is quite common here in Natlan, though, so we often shorten that to "Totem Pole."
Cip: I know what you're thinking, and I don't think that there's any kind of causal relationship there either, but that's what the guard who was posted here before told me.
Cip: Now, I had my doubts, but as I was the new guard and all at the time, I didn't voice them.
Cip: I suppose it's just a little inside joke... Which, for the record, I don't find funny.
Cip: So I'll just tell the same story to whoever my future successor is going to be â€” might be interesting to see how long something as meaningless as this can be passed down.

## Talk

Traveler: Have you thought of any kind of answer?
Cip: Answers must be preceded by questions, I'm afraid.
Cip: And to be honest, I find that my thoughts have already run off to some distant place before I can ever come up with worthwhile questions.
Cip: Strictly speaking, this defeats the purpose of meditation... which might be why I'm a guard, and not the chief.
Cip: Not that this is a bad thing, I mean. Our tribe's got no shortage of eccentrics, so we can just leave the important duties to them, while I do my own job.

## Talk

Traveler: Nah, you're good.
Cip: And that's good. Thank you... Uh, I mean, see you, and stay safe.
