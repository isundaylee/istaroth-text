Traveler: About catching monsters instead of fish...
Delaroche: Oh! Now that I come to think of it... it was quite a unique experience that my own bait attracted monsters instead of fish!
Delaroche: Though I'm not really scared of monsters. I used to commute alone between the Fontaine Research Institute and Court of Fontaine, so I often fought against bandits along the way. I won most of the time too...
Delaroche: However, I am now a director of the Fishing Association, so I must behave like one.
Delaroche: If I scare off the fish or cause any trouble to the people fishing nearby, I would see it as failing to meet people's expectations for a director either way.
Delaroche: That's why I must proceed with self-constraint and caution!
