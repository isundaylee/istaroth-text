# The Illumiscreen: III


## Talk 1

Brother Qian: Try the Illumiscreen...
Traveler: Do you have another image for me?
Brother Qian: You bet! And since you solved both the previous ones so easily, I've swapped the lanterns for the most difficult ones available.
Brother Qian: The same principle applies â€” you combine three images to make one whole. The difficulty is in the fact that they're *linked together* this time.
Brother Qian: Hehe, you'll see what I mean when you give it a try. This time, you're looking for a *divine crane*.
Brother Qian: Once you've got the images to align, you can go find the treasure.

## Talk 2

Brother Qian: How is the treasure hunt going?
Traveler: I've found every last chest.
Brother Qian: Wow, you managed to decipher all three images... That's impressive...
Brother Qian: Ahem. The Guild has prepared an extra-special gift for you on account of you being such an accomplished adventurer.
Brother Qian: See those chests? Go ahead and open them. The contents are all for you.
Traveler: But if I take all the prizes...
Brother Qian: Yep, there'll be squat left for anyone else. That's adventuring for you! Finders keepers.
Brother Qian: Alright then, happy Lantern Rite. Have a good one.

## Talk 3

Brother Qian: Wow. You, um, did it.
Brother Qian: All in a day's work for you, huh? I gotta say, you're one heck of an adventurer.
Brother Qian: Go take a look at the screens. You'll find all the treasure clues in there.

## Talk 4

Brother Qian: The treasure has all been prepared specially by the Guild. Happy hunting.

## Talk 5

Brother Qian: If you'd like to have a try, please come back at nighttime.

## Talk 6

Brother Qian: This time, try and make a *crane*.
