# Pizza From Another Land


## Talk 1

Kiminami Anna: *sigh* What am I to do...
Traveler: What happened?
Kiminami Anna: Traveler? Great, you have perfect timing!
Kiminami Anna: Do you remember the recipe you wrote for me the last time, when you and Ms. Kamisato came to my store?
Kiminami Anna: Oh, that pizza was so popular that many customers came to the store to order it specially.
Kiminami Anna: But... some customers also said that they were bored of eating this pizza all the time and asked if I have other pizza flavors.
Kiminami Anna: Although I have tried several methods to make new types of pizza based on feedback from customers...
Kiminami Anna: But I always feel... that something is lacking, and the response from customers is not very good.
Kiminami Anna: *sigh* Maybe I'm really not good at making pizza...
Kiminami Anna: Traveler, you know a lot about this dish, right? Can you give me some advice?
Traveler: You got it!
Kiminami Anna: Great! By the way, I've also collected feedback from customers. Give me a moment, I'll look for it.
Kiminami Anna: Miss Matsumoto said that although the pizza in my shop incorporates a lot of ingredients from Inazuma, she heard that Mondstadt pizza is not made like this.
Kiminami Anna: She said that for such outland delicacies, it's better to retain it's authentic flavor...
Kiminami Anna: *sigh* But how am I going to know how to make Mondstadt's pizza? Traveler, please help me ask her.
Traveler: About the customers' feedback...
Kiminami Anna: Do you want to take a look at the customer feedback?
Kiminami Anna: Give me a moment, I'll look for it.

## Talk 2

Matsumoto: *sigh* Is there anything in the world that will satisfy my taste buds?
Traveler: About Kiminami Restaurant's pizza...
Matsumoto: Oh, the pizza you mentioned tastes really good, and it also has a lot of local ingredients.
Matsumoto: However, I have tried the authentic Mushroom Pizza before.
Matsumoto: I remember that the pizza was made of Cheese, Cabbage, and Mushrooms...
Matsumoto: Hahaha, I just feel that for such outland delicacies, it's better to retain it's authentic flavor.

## Talk 3

Kiminami Anna: Traveler, you've returned.
Kiminami Anna: How did it go, any feedback?
Traveler: About the customers' feedback...
Kiminami Anna: The original Mushroom Pizza... Hmm, it's worth a try.
Kiminami Anna: The ingredients to prepare are Cheese, Cabbage, and Mushrooms...
Kiminami Anna: We have the other ingredients, but we usually don't stock up on Cheese...
Kiminami Anna: Traveler, could I trouble you to get a block of Cheese?
Traveler: I'll take care of it.
Kiminami Anna: I'm counting on you, then. Just a block of Cheese will do.
Traveler: You don't really use Cheese in the store?
Kiminami Anna: It's not that we don't use it at all, we just use it very rarely.
Kiminami Anna: After all, there are not many dishes in the store that require Cheese, so we don't really stock much of it...
Kiminami Anna: Anyway, I'm counting on you, Traveler. Please help to bring me a block of Cheese.

## Talk 4

Kiminami Anna: Have you brought the ingredients back with you?

## Talk 5

Kiminami Anna: Thank you, these ingredients will do.
Kiminami Anna: The original Mushroom Pizza from Mondstadt, I don't know if I can make it successfully...
Kiminami Anna: It's done!
Kiminami Anna: This pizza looks... pretty good...
Kiminami Anna: Thanks for your help, Traveler. Here, these are for you.
Kiminami Anna: I'll make sure to savor this pizza's taste...
Kiminami Anna: If it's not bad...it should be officially launched as a new dish soon.
