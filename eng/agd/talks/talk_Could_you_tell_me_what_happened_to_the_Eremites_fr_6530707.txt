Traveler: Could you tell me what happened to the Eremites from earlier?
Virda: Oh, sure. Sedile contacted the Gardes. They should be in the Maison Gardiennage's custody by now.
Virda: Sedile said that the Marechaussee Phantom is in charge of finding the bad guys â€” and in the cases that they've been found, we can just directly hand them over to the Maison!
