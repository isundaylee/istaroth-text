Traveler: Can you still be a boatman if you get seasick?
Yizheng: Well, I love the feeling of sailing on water, so there's that...
Yizheng: I've been fascinated with the ocean since I was young. I could watch large ships in the harbor for hours on end every day.
Yizheng: The old men who worked at the dock said that it took many sailors a while to get used to the waves and the wind on the ocean.
Yizheng: I got this job as soon as I came of age so I could get a head start.
Yizheng: And before I knew it, I'd been at this for many years.
