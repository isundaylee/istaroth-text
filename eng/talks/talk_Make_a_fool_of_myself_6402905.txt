Traveler: Make a fool of myself?
Shevirme: That's right. Now, don't tell anyone, but this happened a few days ago. Two groups of researchers were drinking in the tavern and they ended up fighting.
Shevirme: Y'know, those researchers are usually so reserved and polite, even eating roast meat with small bites. But they can also really go at it, huh?
Shevirme: I think it was a fight over who is the best candidate for the Grand Conservator position. They started arguing, then fists flew. Soon, the matra came and took them all away.
Shevirme: Looks like no matter how well-read you are, you still succumb to a few glasses of alcohol, eh?
