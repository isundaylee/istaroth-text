Traveler: About the former generations of the Order of Skeptics...
Zurvan: They claimed to be those that once fought side by side with the heroes of Dahri.

Zurvan: Our battle against the defilement will continue on forever. In the face of such an ever-lasting conflict, the regards of humanity is meaningless.
