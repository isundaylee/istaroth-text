# Steelwing

Continuous gliding or leaving the ground due to jumping will grant the current character a stack of Steelwing every 0.3s, up to a maximum of 3 stacks. When characters initiate Plunging Attacks, each Steelwing stack will increase the DMG of that attack by 35%. This will consume all the stacks of Steelwing that this character possesses.
